We identify two phenotypically and molecularly distinct GBM subtypes governed by identical driver mutations.

In the UK as a whole, 150 cases have been identified and been used to study the clinical and genetic features of NF2. The autosomal dominant inheritance of NF2 was confirmed, 49% of cases were assessed as representing new mutations, and the mutation rate was estimated to be 6 5 x 10-6. Evidence to support a maternal gene effect was found in that age at onset was 18-17 years in 36 maternally inherited cases and 24 5 in 20 paternally inherited cases (p = 0 027). The preponderance of maternally inherited cases was also significant (p = 0-03). Data are presented which suggest that there are two types of NF2, one with later onset and bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the only usual feature, and the other with earlier onset and multiple other tumours. A considerable number of cases did not fall easily into one or other group and other factors such as maternal effect on severity and anticipation need to be considered."Z3MDAKTD,2017,"Guo, Juanjuan; Liu, Shichang; Shang, Xiaotong; Huang, Shanfang; Wang, Kan",Coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics analysis of a full PWR core using RMC and CTF,10.1016/j.anucene.2017.05.041,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306454916311069,2017-11,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\2TNDITHW\Guo et al. - 2017 - Coupled neutronicsthermal-hydraulics analysis of .pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.anucene.2017.05.041.pdf,10.1016_j.anucene.2017.05.041.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.anucene.2017.05.041.txt,10.1016_j.anucene.2017.05.041.txt,"A hybrid coupled strategy was proposed for a coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics analysis of a full PWR core, using the continuous-energy Reactor Monte Carlo code (RMC) and the sub-channel code COBRA-TF (CTF).

The On-The-Fly cross sections treatment of RMC was used to reduce the complexity of the coupled code as well as to reduce the memory requirement. The domain decomposition parallel technique was developed in CTF to improve the efﬁciency of full core sub-channel calculations, and the PWR preprocessor of CTF can reduce the complexity of full core modeling establishment. The coupled codes were applied to steady-state simulations of the Benchmark for Evaluation And Validation of Reactor Simulations (BEAVRS) in the hot, full power condition at the full-core level to reveal the effects of the coupling on the full-core power distribution in both axial and radial directions.

This study describes the preclinical characterization of S49076, a novel, potent inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3. S49076 potently blocked cellular phosphorylation of MET, AXL, and FGFRs and inhibited downstream signaling in vitro and in vivo. In cell models, S49076 inhibited the proliferation of MET- and FGFR2-dependent gastric cancer cells, blocked METdriven migration of lung carcinoma cells, and inhibited colony formation of hepatocarcinoma cells expressing FGFR1/2 and AXL. In tumor xenograft models, a good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for MET and FGFR2 inhibition following oral administration of S49076 was established and correlated well with impact on tumor growth. MET, AXL, and the FGFRs have all been implicated in resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors such as bevacizumab. Accordingly, combination of S49076 with bevacizumab in colon carcinoma xenograft models led to near total inhibition of tumor growth. Moreover, S49076 alone caused tumor growth arrest in bevacizumab-resistant tumors. On the basis of these preclinical studies showing a favorable and novel pharmacologic proﬁle of S49076, a phase I study is currently underway in patients with advanced solid tumors.

These observations suggest that the duration, intensity and cellular context of FGFR signaling during growth plate chondrocyte maturation require tight, regulated control for proper bone elongation. However, the machinery ﬁne-tuning FGFR signaling in chondrocytes is incompletely deﬁned. We report here that neuroﬁbromin, a Ras-GAP encoded by Nf1, has an overlapping expression pattern with FGFR1 and FGFR3 in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and with FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral ossiﬁcation. Based on previous evidence that neuroﬁbromin inhibits Ras-ERK signaling in chondrocytes and phenotypic analogies between mice with constitutive FGFR1 activation and Nf1 deﬁciency in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes, we asked whether neuroﬁbromin is required to control FGFR1Ras-ERK signaling in maturing chondrocytes in vivo. Genetic Nf1 ablation in Fgfr1-deﬁcient chondrocytes reactivated Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes and reversed the expansion of the hypertrophic zone observed in mice lacking Fgfr1 in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes. Histomorphometric and gene expression analyses suggested that neuroﬁbromin, by inhibiting Rankl expression, attenuates pro-osteoclastogenic FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes. We also provide evidence suggesting that neuroﬁbromin in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, downstream of FGFRs and via an indirect mechanism, is required for normal extension and organization of proliferative columns. Collectively, this study indicates that FGFR signaling provides an important input into the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling axis in chondrocytes, and that this input is differentially regulated during chondrocyte maturation by a complex intracellular machinery, of which neuroﬁbromin is a critical component."VA9IWEUT,2015,"Tabas-Madrid, Daniel; Alves-Cruzeiro, Joao; Segura, Victor; Guruceaga, Elizabeth; Vialas, Vital; Prieto, Gorka; García, Carlos; Corrales, Fernando J.; Albar, Juan Pablo; Pascual-Montano, Alberto",Proteogenomics Dashboard for the Human Proteome Project,10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00466,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00466,9/4/2015,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\3V7QKFH4\Tabas-Madrid et al. - 2015 - Proteogenomics Dashboard for the Human Proteome Pr.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1021_acs.jproteome.5b00466.pdf,10.1021_acs.jproteome.5b00466.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1021_acs.jproteome.5b00466.txt,10.1021_acs.jproteome.5b00466.txt,"ABSTRACT: dasHPPboard is a novel proteomics-based dashboard that collects and reports the experiments produced by the Spanish Human Proteome Project consortium (SpHPP) and aims to help HPP to map the entire human proteome.

Despite high remission rates with chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients. Activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without signiﬁcant body weight loss. The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D–dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4–RB pathway in cancer development has been well established. CDK4-speciﬁc inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer.

AZD5363, a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, inhibited all AKT isoforms with a potency of 10 nmol/L or less and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT substrates in cells with a potency of approximately 0.3 to 0.8 mmol/L. AZD5363 monotherapy inhibited the proliferation of 41 of 182 solid and hematologic tumor cell lines with a potency of 3 mmol/L or less. Cell lines derived from breast cancers showed the highest frequency of sensitivity. There was a signiﬁcant relationship between the presence of PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations and sensitivity to AZD5363 and between RAS mutations and resistance. Oral dosing of AZD5363 to nude mice caused doseand time-dependent reduction of PRAS40, GSK3b, and S6 phosphorylation in BT474c xenografts (PRAS40 phosphorylation EC50 $ 0.1 mmol/L total plasma exposure), reversible increases in blood glucose concentrations, and dose-dependent decreases in 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake in U87-MG xenografts. Chronic oral dosing of AZD5363 caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts derived from various tumor types, including HER2? breast cancer models that are resistant to trastuzumab. AZD5363 also signiﬁcantly enhanced the antitumor activity of docetaxel, lapatinib, and trastuzumab in breast cancer xenografts. It is concluded that AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT with pharmacodynamic activity in vivo, has potential to treat a range of solid and hematologic tumors as monotherapy or a combinatorial agent, and has potential for personalized medicine based on the genetic status of PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS.

The Hippo Pathway suppresses tumors in flies and mammals by inactivating transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, and the spectrum of cancers associated with impaired Hippo signaling overlaps strikingly with those associated with alcohol. Therefore, our findings may implicate loss of Hippo Pathway tumor suppression in alcohol-mediated cancers. Ethanol enhanced overgrowth from loss of the expanded, hippo, or warts tumor suppressors but, surprisingly, not from over-expressing the yorkie oncogene. We propose that in parallel to Yorkie-dependent overgrowth, impairing Hippo signaling in the presence of alcohol may promote overgrowth via additional alcohol-relevant targets.

Based on previous observation of increased ASD symptoms in Mendelian disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway (RASopathies), we showed that common SNPs in RASopathy genes show enrichment for association signal in GWAS (P = 0.02). We then screened genome-wide for interactors with RASopathy gene SNPs and showed strong enrichment in ASD-affected individuals (P < 2.2 x 10?16), with a number of pairwise interactions meeting genome-wide criteria for significance. Finally, we utilized quantitative measures of ASD symptoms in RASopathy-affected individuals to perform modifier mapping via GWAS. One top region overlapped between these independent approaches, and we showed dysregulation of a gene in this region, GPR141, in a RASopathy neural cell line. We thus used orthogonal approaches to provide strong evidence for a contribution of epistasis to ASDs, confirm a role for the Ras/MAPK pathway in idiopathic ASDs, and to identify a convergent candidate gene that may interact with the Ras/MAPK pathway."NUHJCBUH,2012,"Pasmant, Eric; Vidaud, Michel; Vidaud, Dominique; Wolkenstein, Pierre",Neurofibromatosis type 1: from genotype to phenotype,10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-100978,http://jmg.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-100978,2012-08,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\NUUYZGUY\Pasmant et al. - 2012 - Neurofibromatosis type 1 from genotype to phenoty.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1136_jmedgenet-2012-100978.pdf,10.1136_jmedgenet-2012-100978.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1136_jmedgenet-2012-100978.txt,10.1136_jmedgenet-2012-100978.txt,"Although neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common Mendelian disorder with autosomal-dominant inheritance, its expression is highly variable and unpredictable. Many NF1 patients have been genotyped but few allelephenotype correlations have been identiﬁed.

We used targeted editing of Nf1 in rats to provide direct evidence of a causal relationship between neuroﬁbromin, the protein product of the Nf1 gene, and pain responses. Our study data identiﬁed a protein-interaction network with collapsin response meditator protein 2 (CRMP2) as a node and neuroﬁbromin, syntaxin 1A, and the N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV2.2) channel as interaction edges. Neuroﬁbromin uncouples CRMP2 from syntaxin 1A. Upon loss/mutation of neuroﬁbromin, as seen in patients with NF1, the CRMP2/Neuroﬁbromin interaction is uncoupled, which frees CRMP2 to interact with both syntaxin 1A and CaV2.2, culminating in increased release of the pro-nociceptive neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Our work also identiﬁed the CRMP2-derived peptide CNRP1, which uncoupled CRMP2’s interactions with neuroﬁbromin, syntaxin 1A, as well as CaV2.2. Here, we tested if CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the Nf1 gene, which leads to functional remodeling of peripheral nociceptors through e?ects on the tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) Na+ voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.7) and CaV2.2, could be a?ected using CNRP1, a peptide designed to target the CRMP2–neuroﬁbromin interface. The data presented here shows that disrupting the CRMP2–neuroﬁbromin interface is su?cient to reverse the dysregulations of voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitter release elicited by Nf1 gene editing. As a consequence of these e?ects, the CNRP1 peptide reversed hyperalgesia to thermal stimulation of the hindpaw observed in Nf1-edited rats.

Multiple strategies are being explored to improve efficacy by concurrent inhibition of other functionally relevant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). XL880 (foretinib, GSK1363089) and XL184 (cabozantinib) are small-molecule inhibitors that potently block multiple RTKs, including VEGFR and the receptor of hepatocyte growth factor c-Met, which can drive tumor invasion and metastasis. This study compared the cellular effects of XL880 and XL184 with those of an RTK inhibitor (XL999) that blocks VEGFR but not c-Met. Treatment of RIP-Tag2 mice with XL999 resulted in 43% reduction in vascularity of spontaneous pancreatic islet tumors over 7 days, but treatment with XL880 or XL184 eliminated approximately 80% of the tumor vasculature, reduced pericytes and empty basement membrane sleeves, caused widespread intratumoral hypoxia and tumor cell apoptosis, and slowed regrowth of the tumor vasculature after drug withdrawal. Importantly, XL880 and XL184 also decreased invasiveness of primary tumors and reduced metastasis. Overall, these findings indicate that inhibition of c-Met and functionally related kinases amplifies the effects of VEGFR blockade and leads to rapid, robust, and progressive regression of tumor vasculature, increased intratumoral hypoxia and apoptosis, and reduced tumor invasiveness and metastasis.

The causative gene for the remaining meningiomas is unknown. Previous studies have shown that these tumours have no recurrent karyotypic abnormalities. They differ from their NF2-related counterparts in that they are more often of the meningothelial subtype and are located preferentially in the anterior skull base. To gain more insight into the aetiology of these tumours, we studied genetic and epigenetic alterations in 25 meningiomas without NF2 involvement. We ﬁrst established a genome-wide allelotype using 3 microsatellite markers per chromosome arm. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected at a low frequency and no indication for the location of putative tumour suppressor genes could be established. We next screened the subtelomeric regions by using 2–3 polymorphic markers close to each telomere. Again no evidence for LOH of a particular chromosome arm was obtained, and no LOH was found in the genomic regions containing the NF2-related ERM family members ezrin and radixin, DAL-1, protein 4.1R, and TSLC1. Mutations in the X-chromosome based family member, moesin, were analysed by SSCP and were not detected. Microsatellite instability was studied using 6 commonly used markers but none of these was altered in any meningioma. Methylation was detected in 5 of 16 genes (NF2, p14ARF , CDH1, BRCA1, RB1 ) previously shown to be silenced in a variety of tumour types. However, methylation percentages for these genes were generally higher in a group of NF2related meningiomas, with the exception of the BRCA1 gene. The NF2 gene was methylated in only 1 of 21 tumours. In conclusion, meningiomas with an intact NF2 gene have a normal karyotype and no obvious genetic or epigenetic aberrations, suggesting that the gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumours are altered by smaller events than can be detected with the techniques used in our study."IU7KVRT3,2011,"DeLucia, Tracey A; Yohay, Kaleb; Widmann, Roger F",Orthopaedic aspects of neurofibromatosis: update:,10.1097/MOP.0b013e32834230ce,https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00008480-201102000-00009,2011-02,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\7GL5JHKL\DeLucia et al. - 2011 - Orthopaedic aspects of neurofibromatosis update.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1097_MOP.0b013e32834230ce.pdf,10.1097_MOP.0b013e32834230ce.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1097_MOP.0b013e32834230ce.txt,10.1097_MOP.0b013e32834230ce.txt,"As animal models improve and clinical trials proceed, there is momentum toward eliminating the musculoskeletal morbidity associated with NF-1."X97XED3K,2007,"McClatchey, Andrea I.",Neurofibromatosis,10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940,http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940,2007-02,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\8IC5WZU8\McClatchey - 2007 - Neurofibromatosis.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\GXJBAFLZ\McClatchey - 2007 - Neurofibromatosis.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1146_annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940.pdf,10.1146_annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1146_annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940.txt,10.1146_annurev.pathol.2.010506.091940.txt,"As familial cancer syndromes, the neuroﬁbromatoses exhibit complex phenotypes, comprising a range of tumor and nontumor manifestations.

This was accomplished through in vivo assessment of vascular parameters (relative CBV and permeability surface-area product) and their changing relationship with increasing glioma grade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with gliomas underwent preoperative perfusion CT and assessment of relative CBV and permeability surface-area product. Regression analyses were performed to assess the rate of change between relative CBV and permeability surface-area product and to test whether these differed for distinct glioma grades. The ratio of relative CBV to permeability surface-area product was also computed and compared among glioma grades by using analysis of variance methods. RESULTS: The rate of change in relative CBV with respect to permeability surface-area product was highest for grade II gliomas followed by grade III and then grade IV (1.64 versus 0.91 versus 0.27, respectively). The difference in the rate of change was signiﬁcant between grade III and IV (P ? .003) and showed a trend for grades II and IV (P ? .098). Relative CBV/permeability surface-area product ratios were the highest for grade II and lowest for grade IV. The pair-wise difference among all 3 groups was signiﬁcant (P ? .001). CONCLUSIONS: There is an increase in relative CBV more than permeability surface-area product in lower grade gliomas, whereas in grade III and especially grade IV gliomas, permeability surface-area product increases much more than relative CBV. The rate of change of relative CBV with respect to permeability surface-area product and relative CBV/permeability surface-area product ratio can serve as an imaging correlate to changes occurring at the tumor microvasculature level."ZPCIBTP7,2012,"Tang, Jean Y.; Mackay-Wiggan, Julian M.; Aszterbaum, Michelle; Yauch, Robert L.; Lindgren, Joselyn; Chang, Kris; Coppola, Carol; Chanana, Anita M.; Marji, Jackleen; Bickers, David R.; Epstein, Ervin H.",Inhibiting the Hedgehog Pathway in Patients with the Basal-Cell Nevus Syndrome,10.1056/NEJMoa1113538,http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa1113538,6/7/2012,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\TMLLQ8MJ\Tang et al. - 2012 - Inhibiting the Hedgehog Pathway in Patients with t.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1056_NEJMoa1113538.pdf,10.1056_NEJMoa1113538.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1056_NEJMoa1113538.txt,10.1056_NEJMoa1113538.txt,"Background Dysregulated hedgehog signaling is the pivotal molecular abnormality underlying basal-cell carcinomas. Vismodegib is a new orally administered hedgehog-pathway inhibitor that produces objective responses in locally advanced and metastatic basalcell carcinomas. Methods We tested the anti–basal-cell carcinoma efficacy of vismodegib in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome at three clinical centers from September 2009 through January 2011. The primary end point was reduction in the incidence of new basal-cell carcinomas that were eligible for surgical resection (surgically eligible) with vismodegib versus placebo after 3 months; secondary end points included reduction in the size of existing basal-cell carcinomas. Results In 41 patients followed for a mean of 8 months (range, 1 to 15) after enrollment, the per-patient rate of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas was lower with vismodegib than with placebo (2 vs. 29 cases per group per year, P<0.001), as was the size (percent change from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter) of existing clinically significant basal-cell carcinomas (?65% vs. ?11%, P?=?0.003). In some patients, all basal-cell carcinomas clinically regressed. No tumors progressed during treatment with vismodegib. Patients receiving vismodegib routinely had grade 1 or 2 adverse events of loss of taste, muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss. Overall, 54% of patients (14 of 26) receiving vismodegib discontinued drug treatment owing to adverse events. At 1 month, vismodegib use had reduced the hedgehog targetgene expression by basal-cell carcinoma by 90% (P<0.001) and diminished tumorcell proliferation, but apoptosis was not affected. No residual basal-cell carcinoma was detectable in 83% of biopsy samples taken from sites of clinically regressed basalcell carcinomas. Conclusions Vismodegib reduces the basal-cell carcinoma tumor burden and blocks growth of new basal-cell carcinomas in patients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome. The adverse events associated with treatment led to discontinuation in over half of treated patients.

Although the literature offers conﬂicting evidence for association of NF1 and autism, there has been no systematic evaluation of autism traits in the RASopathies as a class to support a role for germline Ras/MAPK activation in ASDs. Methods We examined the association of autism traits with NF1, NS, CS and CFC, comparing affected probands with unaffected sibling controls and subjects with idiopathic ASDs using the qualitative Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the quantitative Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Results Each of the four major RASopathies showed evidence for increased qualitative and quantitative autism traits compared with sibling controls. Further, each RASopathy exhibited a distinct distribution of quantitative social impairment. Levels of social responsiveness show some evidence of correlation between sibling pairs, and autism-like impairment showed a male bias similar to idiopathic ASDs. Conclusions Higher prevalence and severity of autism traits in RASopathies compared to unaffected siblings suggests that dysregulation of Ras/MAPK signalling during development may be implicated in ASD risk. Evidence for sex bias and potential sibling correlation suggests that autism traits in the RASopathies share characteristics with autism traits in the general population and clinical ASD population and can shed light on idiopathic ASDs."5CTBQTCX,2011,"Sharif, S.; Upadhyaya, M.; Ferner, R.; Majounie, E.; Shenton, A.; Baser, M.; Thakker, N.; Evans, D.

OPGs behave differently in NF1, and, given their frequency, surveillance is important. However, this is difﬁcult because of the additional complications these patients may have, such as learning difﬁculties. Management is also different given that NF1 results from loss of function of tumour suppressor gene. A genotypeephenotype correlation may help to determine who is at risk of developing these tumours, aid focused screening, and shed light on response to treatments. Methods As part of a long-term follow-up study of patients with NF1 OPGs, the authors assessed genotypeephenotype correlation. Fluorescein in situ hybridisation was performed to identify large deletions, and then a full gene screen for mutations, by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results 80 patients with NF1 OPGs were identiﬁed, and molecular analyses were performed in a subset of 29. A clustering of pathogenic changes in the 59 tertile of the gene was found. The authors combined these results with those for another two NF1 OPG cohorts and collectively found the same trend. When compared with a control population of NF1 patients without an OPG, the OR of a mutation being present in the 59 tertile was 6.05 (p?0.003) in the NF1 OPG combined cohorts. Conclusion It is possible that genotype is a signiﬁcant determinant of the risk of development of OPGs in NF1. around 5% of NF1 cases.8 9 Differences have been"BGF4MEEB,2012,"Robertson, Kent A; Nalepa, Grzegorz; Yang, Feng-Chun; Bowers, Daniel C; Ho, Chang Y; Hutchins, Gary D; Croop, James M; Vik, Terry A; Denne, Scott C; Parada, Luis F; Hingtgen, Cynthia M; Walsh, Laurence E; Yu, Menggang; Pradhan, Kamnesh R; Edwards-Brown, Mary K; Cohen, Mervyn D; Fletcher, James W; Travers, Jeffrey B; Staser, Karl W; Lee, Melissa W; Sherman, Marcie R; Davis, Cynthia J; Miller, Lucy C; Ingram, David A; Clapp, D Wade",Imatinib mesylate for plexiform neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: a phase 2 trial,10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70414-X,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147020451270414X,2012-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\MSAKHMD2\Robertson et al. - 2012 - Imatinib mesylate for plexiform neurofibromas in p.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_S1470-2045(12)70414-X.pdf,10.1016_S1470-2045(12)70414-X.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_S1470-2045(12)70414-X.txt,10.1016_S1470-2045(12)70414-X.txt,"Background Plexiform neuroﬁbromas are slow-growing chemoradiotherapy-resistant tumours arising in patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Methods We determined the expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and three of its receptors, VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, and neuropilin-2, in paraffinembedded samples from 21 vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and from 22 sporadic schwannomas. Ten consecutive patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas who were not candidates for standard treatment were treated with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. An imaging response was defined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor volume, as compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined as a significant increase in the word-recognition score, as compared with baseline. Results VEGF was expressed in 100% of vestibular schwannomas and VEGFR-2 in 32% of tumor vessels on immunohistochemical analysis. Before treatment, the median annual volumetric growth rate for 10 index tumors was 62%. After bevacizumab treatment in the 10 patients, tumors shrank in 9 patients, and 6 patients had an imaging response, which was maintained in 4 patients during 11 to 16 months of follow-up.

Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is thought to be the key driver of pediatric low-grade astrocytoma (PLGA) growth. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting BRAF, VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit. This multicenter phase II study was conducted to determine the response rate to sorafenib in patients with recurrent or progressive PLGA. Methods. Key eligibility criteria included age ≥2 years, progressive PLGA evaluable on MRI, and at least one prior chemotherapy treatment. Sorafenib was administered twice daily at 200 mg/m2/dose (maximum of 400 mg/dose) in continuous 28-day cycles. MRI, including 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis, was performed every 12 weeks. BRAF molecular testing was performed on tumor tissue when available. Results. Eleven patients, including 3 with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), were evaluable for response; 5 tested positive for BRAF duplication. Nine patients (82%) came off trial due to radiological tumor progression after 2 or 3 cycles, including 3 patients with conﬁrmed BRAF duplication. Median time to progression was 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1– 31.0 months). Enrollment was terminated early due to this rapid and unexpectedly high progression rate. Tumor tissue obtained from 4 patients after termination of the study showed viable pilocytic or pilomyxoid astrocytoma. Conclusions. Sorafenib produced unexpected and unprecedented acceleration of tumor growth in children with PLGA, irrespective of NF1 or tumor BRAF status. In vitro studies with sorafenib indicate that this effect is likely related to paradoxical ERK activation. Close monitoring for early tumor progression should be included in trials of novel agents that modulate signal transduction."N7IHZ5J8,2014,"Giovannini, Marco; Bonne, Nicolas-Xavier; Vitte, Jeremie; Chareyre, Fabrice; Tanaka, Karo; Adams, Rocky; Fisher, Laurel M.; Valeyrie-Allanore, Laurence; Wolkenstein, Pierre; Goutagny, Stephane; Kalamarides, Michel",mTORC1 inhibition delays growth of neurofibromatosis type 2 schwannoma,10.1093/neuonc/not242,https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/neuonc/not242,2014-04,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\H5MZESQR\Giovannini et al. - 2014 - mTORC1 inhibition delays growth of neurofibromatos.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1093_neuonc_not242.pdf,10.1093_neuonc_not242.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1093_neuonc_not242.txt,10.1093_neuonc_not242.txt,"Background. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, resulting in a variety of neural tumors, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the most frequent manifestation. Recently, merlin, the NF2 tumor suppressor, has been identiﬁed as a novel negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin was shown to result in elevated mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related tumors. Thus, mTORC1 pathway inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach. Methods. We studied in vitro cell models, cohorts of mice allografted with Nf22/2 Schwann cells, and a genetically modiﬁed mouse model of NF2 schwannoma in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the proposed targeted therapy for NF2. Results. We found that treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduced the severity of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis without signiﬁcant toxicity. Consistent with these results, in an NF2 patient with growing vestibular schwannomas, the rapalog sirolimus induced tumor growth arrest. Conclusions.

The eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex plays a pivotal role in protein translation initiation; however, its importance in malignant and benign Schwann cell tumors has not been explored, and whether blocking eIF4F function is effective for treating these tumors is not known. Methods. Immunostaining was performed on human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and vestibular schwannomas (VSs) for eIF4F components. The role of eIF4A and eIF4E in cell growth was assessed by RNA interference. Various natural compounds were screened for their growth-inhibitory activity. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed to characterize the action of silvestrol, and its antitumor activity was veriﬁed in orthotopic mouse models. Results. MPNSTs and VSs frequently overexpressed eIF4A, eIF4E, and/or eIF4G. Depletion of eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4E substantially reduced MPNST cell growth. From screening a panel of plant-derived compounds, the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol was identiﬁed as a leading agent with nanomolar IC50 values in MPNST and VS cells. Silvestrol induced G2/M arrest in both NF1-deﬁcient and NF1expressing MPNST cells and primary VS cells. Silvestrol consistently decreased the levels of multiple cyclins, Aurora A, and mitogenic kinases AKT and ERKs. Silvestrol treatment dramatically suppressed tumor growth in mouse models for NF12/2 MPNST and Nf22/2 schwannoma. This decreased tumor growth was accompanied by elevated phospho-histone H3 and TUNEL labeling, consistent with G2/M arrest and apoptosis in silvestrol-treated tumor cells. Conclusions. The eIF4F complex is a potential therapeutic target in MPNSTs and VS, and silvestrol may be a promising agent for treating these tumors."46N6CULI,2015,"Marti, Cindy L.; Glassman, Steven D.; Knott, Patrick T.; Carreon, Leah Y.; Hresko, Michael T.",Scoliosis Research Society members attitudes towards physical therapy and physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,10.1186/s13013-015-0041-z,http://scoliosisjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13013-015-0041-z,2015-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\XSM7CNSK\Marti et al. - 2015 - Scoliosis Research Society members attitudes towar.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_s13013-015-0041-z.pdf,10.1186_s13013-015-0041-z.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_s13013-015-0041-z.txt,10.1186_s13013-015-0041-z.txt,"Background: Attitudes regarding non-operative treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) may be changing with the publication of BRAiST. Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) are used to treat AIS, but high-quality evidence is limited. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitudes of members of the Scoliosis Research Society towards PSSE. Methods: A survey was sent to all SRS members with questions on use of Physical Therapy (PT) and PSSE for AIS. Results: The majority of the 263 respondents were from North America (175, 67 %), followed by Asia (37, 14 %) and Europe (36, 14 %). The majority of respondents (166, 63 %) prescribed neither PT nor PSSE, 28 (11 %) prescribed both PT and PSSE, 39 (15 %) prescribe PT only and 30 (11 %) prescribe PSSE only. PT was prescribed by 67 respondents, as an adjunct to bracing (39) and in small curves (32); with goals to improve aesthetics (27) and post-operative outcomes (25). Of the 196 who do not prescribe PT, the main reasons were lack of evidence (149) and the perception that PT had no value (112). PSSE was prescribed by 58 respondents. The most common indication was as an adjunct to bracing (49) or small curves (41); with goals to improve aesthetics (36), prevent curve progression (35) and improve quality of life (31). Of the respondents who do not prescribe PSSE, the main reasons were lack of supporting research (149), a perception that PSSE had no value (108), and lack of access (63). Most respondents state that evidence of efficacy may increase the role of PSSE, with 85 % (223 of 263) favoring funding PSSE studies by the SRS. Conclusion: The results show that 22 % of the respondents use PSSE for AIS, skepticism remains regarding the benefit of PSSE for AIS.

Analysis of the NF-1 gene (NF1) suggests that the function of its product, neurofibromin, is reduced in affected persons and that NF1 belongs to the tumor-suppressor class of recessive cancer genes. This model is consistent with evidence that neurofibromin accelerates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphate-hydrolyzing activity of the Ras family of regulatory proteins. Loss of constitutional heterozygosity has not been reported in the benign tumors associated with NF-1, however, and has only been detected in a few malignant neural-crest tumors and in some tumor-derived cell lines. METHODS: We studied DNA extracted from the bone marrow of 11 children with NF-1 in whom malignant myeloid disorders developed and from parental leukocytes. We used a series of polymorphic markers within and near NF1 to determine whether leukemogenesis was associated with structural alterations of the gene. RESULTS: Bone marrow samples from five patients showed loss of heterozygosity. In each case, the NF1 allele was inherited from a parent with NF-1 and the normal allele was deleted. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence of NF1 may function as a tumor-suppressor allele in malignant myeloid diseases in children with NF-1 and that neurofibromin is a regulator of ras in early myelopoiesis."8N2VJAQB,2011,"Lee, Dong Yeon; Cho, Tae-Joon; Lee, Hye Ran; Lee, Kang; Moon, Hyuk Joo; Park, Moon Seok; Yoo, Won Joon; Chung, Chin Youb; Choi, In Ho",Disturbed Osteoblastic Differentiation of Fibrous Hamartoma Cell from Congenital Pseudarthrosis of the Tibia Associated with Neurofibromatosis Type I,10.4055/cios.2011.3.3.230,https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4055/cios.2011.3.3.230,2011,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\YT7IFS7F\Lee et al. - 2011 - Disturbed Osteoblastic Differentiation of Fibrous .pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.4055_cios.2011.3.3.230.pdf,10.4055_cios.2011.3.3.230.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.4055_cios.2011.3.3.230.txt,10.4055_cios.2011.3.3.230.txt,"Background: Fibrous hamartoma is the key pathology of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT), which was shown to have low osteogenicity and high osteoclastogenicity. This study further investigated the mechanism of impaired osteoblastic differentiation of ﬁbrous hamartoma cells. Methods: Fibroblast-like cells were obtained from enzymatically dissociated ﬁbrous hamartomas of 11 patients with CPT associated with neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1). Periosteal cells were also obtained from the distal tibial periosteum of 3 patients without CPT or NF1 as control. The mRNA levels of Wnt ligands and their canonical receptors, such as Lrp5 and ?-catenin, were assayed using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Changes in mRNA expression of osteoblast marker genes by rhBMP2 treatment were assayed using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression of transcription factors speciﬁcally involved in osteoblastic differentiation by rhBMP2 treatment was also assayed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results: Wnt1 and Wnt3a mRNA expression was lower in ﬁbrous hamartoma than in tibial periosteal cells, but their canonical receptors did not show signiﬁcant difference. Response of osteoblastic marker gene expression to rhBMP2 treatment showed patient-to-patient variability. Col1a1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in most ﬁbrous hamartoma tissues, osteocalcin was upregulated in a small number of patients, and ALP expression was down-regulated in most ﬁbrous hamartoma tissues. Changes in mRNA expression of the transcription factors in response to rhBMP2 also showed factor-to-factor and patient-to-patient variability. Dlx5 was consistently up-regulated by rhBMP2 treatment in all ﬁbrous hamartoma tissues tested. Msx2 expression was downregulated by rhBMP2 in most cases but by lesser extent than control tissue. Runx2 expression was up-regulated in 8 out of 18 ﬁbrous hamartoma tissues tested. Osterix expression was up-regulated in 2 and down-regulated in 3 ﬁbrous hamartoma tissues. Conclusions: Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia appears to be caused by ﬁbrous hamartoma originating from aberrant growth of Nf1 haploinsufﬁcient periosteal cells, which failed in terminal osteoblastic differentiation and arrested at a certain stage of this process. This pathomechanism of CPT should be targeted in the development of novel therapeutic biologic intervention."HAHCYZ6C,2014,"Vogt, Julia; Bengesser, Kathrin; Claes, Kathleen BM; Wimmer, Katharina; Mautner, Victor-Felix; van Minkelen, Rick; Legius, Eric; Brems, Hilde; Upadhyaya, Meena; Högel, Josef; Lazaro, Conxi; Rosenbaum, Thorsten; Bammert, Simone; Messiaen, Ludwine; Cooper, David N; Kehrer-Sawatzki, Hildegard",SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion represents a novel mutational mechanism underlying large genomic copy number changes with non-recurrent breakpoints,10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r80,http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r80,2014,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\UHNM8WV4\Vogt et al. - 2014 - SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion .pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_gb-2014-15-6-r80.pdf,10.1186_gb-2014-15-6-r80.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_gb-2014-15-6-r80.txt,10.1186_gb-2014-15-6-r80.txt,"Background: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However, region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated. Results: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites. Conclusions: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome."8VD3NDMS,2015,"Mejía-Roa, Edgardo; Tabas-Madrid, Daniel; Setoain, Javier; García, Carlos; Tirado, Francisco; Pascual-Montano, Alberto",NMF-mGPU: non-negative matrix factorization on multi-GPU systems,10.1186/s12859-015-0485-4,http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0485-4,2015-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\5CZ89GRJ\Mejía-Roa et al. - 2015 - NMF-mGPU non-negative matrix factorization on mul.PDF,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_s12859-015-0485-4.pdf,10.1186_s12859-015-0485-4.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_s12859-015-0485-4.txt,10.1186_s12859-015-0485-4.txt,"Background: In the last few years, the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique has gained a great interest among the Bioinformatics community, since it is able to extract interpretable parts from high-dimensional datasets. However, the computing time required to process large data matrices may become impractical, even for a parallel application running on a multiprocessors cluster. In this paper, we present NMF-mGPU, an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of the NMF algorithm that takes advantage of the high computing performance delivered by Graphics-Processing Units (GPUs). Driven by the ever-growing demands from the video-games industry, graphics cards usually provided in PCs and laptops have evolved from simple graphics-drawing platforms into high-performance programmable systems that can be used as coprocessors for linear-algebra operations. However, these devices may have a limited amount of on-board memory, which is not considered by other NMF implementations on GPU. Results: NMF-mGPU is based on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), the NVIDIA’s framework for GPU computing. On devices with low memory available, large input matrices are blockwise transferred from the system’s main memory to the GPU’s memory, and processed accordingly. In addition, NMF-mGPU has been explicitly optimized for the different CUDA architectures. Finally, platforms with multiple GPUs can be synchronized through MPI (Message Passing Interface). In a four-GPU system, this implementation is about 120 times faster than a single conventional processor, and more than four times faster than a single GPU device (i.e., a super-linear speedup). Conclusions: Applications of GPUs in Bioinformatics are getting more and more attention due to their outstanding performance when compared to traditional processors. In addition, their relatively low price represents a highly cost-effective alternative to conventional clusters. In life sciences, this results in an excellent opportunity to facilitate the daily work of bioinformaticians that are trying to extract biological meaning out of hundreds of gigabytes of experimental information. NMF-mGPU can be used “out of the box” by researchers with little or no expertise in GPU programming in a variety of platforms, such as PCs, laptops, or high-end GPU clusters.

Haploinsufficiency of NF1 fosters a permissive tumorigenic environment through changes in signalling between cells, however the intracellular mechanisms for this tumor-promoting effect are less clear. Most primary human NF1+/- cells are a challenge to obtain, however lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been collected from large NF1 kindreds. We hypothesized that the genetic effects of NF1-haploinsufficiency may be discerned by comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiling in somatic, non-tumor cells (LCLs) from NF1-affected and -unaffected individuals. As a cross-species filter for heterogeneity, we compared the results from two human kindreds to whole-genome transcriptional profiling in spleen-derived B lymphocytes from age- and gender-matched Nf1+/- and wild-type mice, and used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Onto-Express, Pathway-Express and MetaCore tools to identify genes perturbed in NF1haploinsufficiency. Results: We observed moderate expression of NF1 in human LCLs and of Nf1 in CD19+ mouse B lymphocytes. Using the t test to evaluate individual transcripts, we observed modest expression differences in the transcriptome in NF1-haploinsufficient LCLs and Nf1-haploinsuffiicient mouse B lymphocytes. However, GSEA, Onto-Express, Pathway-Express and MetaCore analyses identified genes that control cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, transcription and translation, and immune response as the most perturbed in NF1-haploinsufficient conditions in both human and mouse. Conclusions: Haploinsufficiency arises when loss of one allele of a gene is sufficient to give rise to disease. Haploinsufficiency has traditionally been viewed as a passive state. Our observations of perturbed, up-regulated cell cycle and DNA repair pathways may functionally contribute to NF1-haploinsufficiency as an “active state” that ultimately promotes the loss of the wild-type allele."N4ZAL4LK,2011,"Kolanczyk, Mateusz; Mautner, Victor; Kossler, Nadine; Nguyen, Rosa; Kühnisch, Jirko; Zemojtel, Tomasz; Jamsheer, Aleksander; Wegener, Eike; Thurisch, Boris; Tinschert, Sigrid; Holtkamp, Nikola; Park, Su-Jin; Birch, Patricia; Kendler, David; Harder, Anja; Mundlos, Stefan; Kluwe, Lan",MIA is a potential biomarker for tumour load in neurofibromatosis type 1,10.1186/1741-7015-9-82,http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-82,2011-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\FSX78HBD\Kolanczyk et al. - 2011 - MIA is a potential biomarker for tumour load in ne.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_1741-7015-9-82.pdf,10.1186_1741-7015-9-82.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_1741-7015-9-82.txt,10.1186_1741-7015-9-82.txt,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent genetic disease characterized by multiple benign tumours with increased risk for malignancy. There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients. Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs. These mice do not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including deregulation of cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1 tumours require for their growth the master regulator of cartilage differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific genes deregulated in an Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour and serum samples of NF1 patients. Results: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in all NF1-related tumours and its serum levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls. Among NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform neurofibromas and in those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without such tumours. Most notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden. Conclusions: MIA is a potential serum biomarker of tumour load in NF1 patients which could be useful in following the disease course and monitoring the efficacy of therapies."V7K7CLT3,2017,"Ibrahim, Amira F.A.; Montojo, Caroline A.; Haut, Kristen M.; Karlsgodt, Katherine H.; Hansen, Laura; Congdon, Eliza; Rosser, Tena; Bilder, Robert M.; Silva, Alcino J.; Bearden, Carrie E.",Spatial working memory in neurofibromatosis 1: Altered neural activity and functional connectivity,10.1016/j.nicl.2017.06.032,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213158217301638,2017,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\TT2TW2ZS\Ibrahim et al. - 2017 - Spatial working memory in neurofibromatosis 1 Alt.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.nicl.2017.06.032.pdf,10.1016_j.nicl.2017.06.032.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.nicl.2017.06.032.txt,10.1016_j.nicl.2017.06.032.txt,"Background: Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that disrupts central nervous system development and neuronal function. Cognitively, NF1 is characterized by di?culties with executive control and visuospatial abilities. Little is known about the neural substrates underlying these deﬁcits. The current study utilized Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) to explore the neural correlates of spatial working memory (WM) deﬁcits in patients with NF1. Methods: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age M = 32.69; 61% male) and 25 matched healthy controls (age M = 33.08; 64% male) during an in-scanner visuo-spatial WM task. Whole brain functional and psycho-physiological interaction analyses were utilized to investigate neural activity and functional connectivity, respectively, during visuo-spatial WM performance. Participants also completed behavioral measures of spatial reasoning and verbal WM. Results: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced recruitment of key components of WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls exhibited greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporal regions than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual cortices as well as between the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling of the PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial reasoning and WM performance, respectively; these relationships were not observed in controls. Conclusions: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional connectivity of ‘task-negative’ regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM di?culties characteristic of the disorder."9IJIP8BK,2007,"Hyman, S.

Method: A cohort of 76 children with NF1 and 45 unaffected sibling controls (aged 8–16 years) underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment, with the NF1 children having MRI examinations. Results: The presence or number of T2 hyperintensities (T2H) was not associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, the location of discrete (well circumscribed) T2H in the thalamus was associated with severe and generalised cognitive impairment. More diffuse lesions in the thalamus were also associated with reductions in IQ but the effects were less marked compared with the discrete lesions. Comparing children with NF1 to their unaffected siblings revealed more subtle effects of the lesions on cognitive ability. Conclusions: T2H cannot be used in general as a radiological marker for cognitive deficits in children with NF1; however, lesions in the thalamus are strongly associated with cognitive impairment. It is possible that lesions in the thalamus in conjunction with more general thalamic hypometabolism may compound the level of thalamic dysfunction, resulting in cognitive deficits well beyond those produced by T2H in other regions."BKARQ8MW,2013,"Mainberger, Florian; Jung, Nikolai H; Zenker, Martin; Wahlländer, Ute; Freudenberg, Leonie; Langer, Susanne; Berweck, Steffen; Winkler, Tobias; Straube, Andreas; Heinen, Florian; Granström, Sofia; Mautner, Victor-Felix; Lidzba, Karen; Mall, Volker",Lovastatin improves impaired synaptic plasticity and phasic alertness in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1,10.1186/1471-2377-13-131,http://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-13-131,2013-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\DH9BUN6F\Mainberger et al. - 2013 - Lovastatin improves impaired synaptic plasticity a.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_1471-2377-13-131.pdf,10.1186_1471-2377-13-131.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_1471-2377-13-131.txt,10.1186_1471-2377-13-131.txt,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders causing learning disabilities by mutations in the neurofibromin gene, an important inhibitor of the RAS pathway. In a mouse model of NF1, a loss of function mutation of the neurofibromin gene resulted in increased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition which led to decreased synaptic plasticity and deficits in attentional performance. Most importantly, these defictis were normalized by lovastatin. This placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study aimed to investigate synaptic plasticity and cognition in humans with NF1 and tried to answer the question whether potential deficits may be rescued by lovastatin. Methods: In NF1 patients (n = 11; 19–44 years) and healthy controls (HC; n = 11; 19–31 years) paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study intracortical inhibition (paired pulse) and synaptic plasticity (paired associative stimulation). On behavioural level the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) was used. To study the effect of 200 mg lovastatin for 4 days on all these parameters, a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized trial was performed. Results: In patients with NF1, lovastatin revealed significant decrease of intracortical inhibition, significant increase of synaptic plasticity as well as significant increase of phasic alertness. Compared to HC, patients with NF1 exposed increased intracortical inhibition, impaired synaptic plasticity and deficits in phasic alertness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, a link between a pathological RAS pathway activity, intracortical inhibition and impaired synaptic plasticity and its rescue by lovastatin in humans.

Plexiform neurofibromas are clinically heterogeneous, and knowledge of their natural history is limited. In order to characterise the growth of plexiform neurofibromas better, we performed serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NF1 patients with such tumours. Methods: MRI was done on 44 plexiform neurofibromas in 34 NF1 patients (median age 10 years; range 1–47 years). Each tumour was measured in two dimensions from the MRI scan, and the area and growth rate were calculated. The median length of follow-up was 6 years, with an average interval of 3 years between scans. Results: 36 tumours remained stable in size throughout the period of follow-up. 8 tumours increased in size; all occurred in patients who were under 21 years of age when first studied. The single exception was a man who developed rapid tumour growth and pain in a plexiform neurofibroma that had been followed for 10 years. Biopsy showed the presence of an MPNST. Conclusion: Longitudinal MRI is a valuable means of monitoring the growth of plexiform neurofibromas in individuals with NF1."E3V3FIQA,2012,"Vallée, Béatrice; Doudeau, Michel; Godin, Fabienne; Gombault, Aurélie; Tchalikian, Aurélie; de Tauzia, Marie-Ludivine; Bénédetti, Hélène",Nf1 RasGAP Inhibition of LIMK2 Mediates a New Cross-Talk between Ras and Rho Pathways,10.1371/journal.pone.0047283,http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047283,10/17/2012,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\9ZC2KF7Z\Vallée et al. - 2012 - Nf1 RasGAP Inhibition of LIMK2 Mediates a New Cros.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1371_journal.pone.0047283.pdf,10.1371_journal.pone.0047283.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1371_journal.pone.0047283.txt,10.1371_journal.pone.0047283.txt,"Background: Ras GTPases mediate numerous biological processes through their ability to cycle between an inactive GDPbound form and an active GTP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) favor the formation of the active Ras-GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) promote the formation of inactive Ras-GDP. Numerous studies have established complex signaling cross-talks between Ras GTPases and other members of the superfamily of small GTPases. GEFs were thought to play a major role in these cross-talks. However, recently GAPs were also shown to play crucial roles in these processes. Among RasGAPs, Nf1 is of special interest. Nf1 is responsible for the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type I, and recent data strongly suggest that this RasGAP connects different signaling pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to know if the RasGAP Nf1 might play a role in connecting Ras GTPases to other small GTPase pathways, we systematically looked for new partners of Nf1, by performing a yeast two-hybrid screening on its SecPH domain. LIMK2, a major kinase of the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway, was identified in this screening. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and further characterized it. We also demonstrated its specificity: the close related homolog of LIMK2, LIMK1, does not interact with the SecPH domain of Nf1. We then showed that SecPH partially inhibits the kinase activity of LIMK2 on cofilin. Our results furthermore suggest a precise mechanism for this inhibition: in fact, SecPH would specifically prevent LIMK2 activation by ROCK, its upstream regulator. Conclusions/Significance: Although previous data had already connected Nf1 to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, our study provides for the first time possible detailed molecular requirements of this involvement. Nf1/LIMK2 interaction and inhibition allows to directly connect neurofibromatosis type I to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and provides evidence that the RasGAP Nf1 mediates a new cross-talk between Ras and Rho signaling pathways within the superfamily of small GTPases."F5P8AQDL,2011,"Rousseau, Guillaume; Noguchi, Tetsuro; Bourdon, Violaine; Sobol, Hagay; Olschwang, Sylviane",SMARCB1/INI1 germline mutations contribute to 10% of sporadic schwannomatosis,10.1186/1471-2377-11-9,http://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-11-9,2011-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\75XYAQH2\Rousseau et al. - 2011 - SMARCB1INI1 germline mutations contribute to 10% .pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_1471-2377-11-9.pdf,10.1186_1471-2377-11-9.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_1471-2377-11-9.txt,10.1186_1471-2377-11-9.txt,"Background: Schwannomatosis is a disease characterized by multiple non-vestibular schwannomas. Although biallelic NF2 mutations are found in schwannomas, no germ line event is detected in schwannomatosis patients. In contrast, germline mutations of the SMARCB1 (INI1) tumor suppressor gene were described in familial and sporadic schwannomatosis patients. Methods: To delineate the SMARCB1 gene contribution, the nine coding exons were sequenced in a series of 56 patients affected with a variable number of non-vestibular schwannomas. Results: Nine variants scattered along the sequence of SMARCB1 were identified. Five of them were classified as deleterious. All five patients carrying a SMARCB1 mutation had more multiple schwannomas, corresponding to 10.2% of patients with schwannomatosis. They were also diagnosed before 35 years of age. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with schwannomas have a significant probability of carrying a SMARCB1 mutation.

Flow cytometry, Western blots and metabolic tracer uptake assays were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to TAK733. Results: Fourteen cutaneous melanoma cell lines with different driver mutations were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of TAK733, with a higher proportion of BRAFV600E mutant cell lines being highly sensitive with IC50s below 1 nM. The five uveal melanoma cell lines had GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and were either moderately or highly sensitive to TAK733. The tested cell lines wild type for NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ and GNA11 driver mutations were moderately to highly resistant to TAK733. TAK733 led to a decrease in pERK and G1 arrest in most of these melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin, driver oncogenic mutations and in vitro sensitivity to TAK733. MEK inhibition resulted in increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and GNAQ mutant cell lines than in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines.

Methods: Two hundred and one NF1 patients underwent whole body MRI (WBMRI). Tumour burden was estimated volumetrically. Non-parametric Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients were used to analyse the relationship of growth rate to tumour volume and age. Chi-squared and Mann–Whitney U tests were used for analysing the association of tumour occurrence with sex or age. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse the association of tumour growth with age group. Results: Seventy-one of 171 patients with serial WBMRI exams had internal PNs (median follow up 2.2 years [1.1 to 4.9 years]). Median whole body tumour volume was 86.4 mL [5.2 to 5878.5 mL]) with a median growth rate of 3.7%/year (?13.4 to 111%/year) that correlated with larger whole body tumour volume (P<0.001) and lower age (P=0.004).

Consequently, additional clinical data are critical to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib. Objective: We sought to assess efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib, while providing early drug access to patients with advanced BCC and limited treatment options. Methods: This was an open-label, multicenter study in patients with advanced BCC inappropriate for radiotherapy or surgery. Patients received 150 mg vismodegib daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Tumor response was assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0. Results: A total of 119 patients with advanced BCC took vismodegib for a median of 5.5 months. Objective responses occurred in 46.4% of locally advanced BCC and 30.8% of patients with metastatic BCC. Response was negatively associated with prior systemic therapy in patients with locally advanced BCC (P = .002). Mean follow-up for safety was 6.5 months, with muscle spasms (70.6%), dysgeusia (70.6%), alopecia (58.0%), and diarrhea (25.2%) as the most common adverse events. Limitations: Abbreviated follow-up time because of study termination upon FDA approval was a limitation. Conclusion: This study provides important clinical data supporting the efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib. Larger studies are underway to assess predictors of response and long-term outcomes.

However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules. Results: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 – 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 – 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifier’s NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples. Conclusions: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine."GC5VAWV4,2015,"Seminog, O O; Goldacre, M J",Age-specific risk of breast cancer in women with neurofibromatosis type 1,10.1038/bjc.2015.78,http://www.nature.com/articles/bjc201578,2015-04,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\UN4N9PWM\Seminog and Goldacre - 2015 - Age-specific risk of breast cancer in women with n.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1038_bjc.2015.78.pdf,10.1038_bjc.2015.78.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1038_bjc.2015.78.txt,10.1038_bjc.2015.78.txt,"Background: Young women with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are reported to have a higher risk of breast cancer than others, and this might have implications for screening programmes.

Results—We report the clinical features of five patients with a BP4-BP5 deletion, three with a BP4–BP5 duplication, and two with an overlapping but smaller duplication identified by whole genome high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH. These BP4–BP5 deletion cases exhibit minor dysmorphic features, significant expressive language deficits, and a spectrum of neuropsychiatric impairments that include autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and mood disorder. Cognitive impairment varied from moderate mental retardation to normal IQ with learning disability. BP4–BP5 covers ~1.5Mb (chr15:28.719–30.298Mb) and includes 6 reference genes and 1 miRNA gene, while the smaller duplications cover ~500 kb (chr15:28.902–29.404 Mb) and contain 3 reference genes and one miRNA gene.

These two diseases are fully penetrant but with high heterogeneity in phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of genetic modifiers in modulating patients’ phenotypes. Although NF1 is recognized as a developmental disorder and IBMPFD is associated with degeneration of multiple tissues, a recent study discovered the direct protein interaction between neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, and VCP/p97, encoded by the causative gene of IBMPFD. Both NF1 and VCP/p97 are critical for dendritic spine formation, which provides the cellular mechanism explaining the cognitive deficits and dementia found in patients. Moreover, disruption of the interaction between neurofibromin and VCP impairs dendritic spinogenesis. Neurofibromin likely influences multiple downstream pathways to control dendritic spinogenesis. One is to activate the protein kinase A pathway to initiate dendritic spine formation; another is to regulate the synaptic distribution of VCP and control the activity of VCP in dendritic spinogenesis. Since neurofibromin and VCP/p97 also regulate cell growth and bone metabolism, the understanding of neurofibromin and VCP/p97 in neurons may be applied to study of cancer and bone. Statin treatment rescues the spine defects caused by VCP deficiency, suggesting the potential role of statin in clinical treatment for these two diseases."LP7VWL7V,2013,"Maertens, Ophélia; Johnson, Bryan; Hollstein, Pablo; Frederick, Dennie T.; Cooper, Zachary A.; Messiaen, Ludwine; Bronson, Roderick T.; McMahon, Martin; Granter, Scott; Flaherty, Keith; Wargo, Jennifer A.; Marais, Richard; Cichowski, Karen",Elucidating Distinct Roles for <i>NF1</i> in Melanomagenesis,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0313,http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0313,2013-03,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\STZ27MCT\Maertens et al. - 2013 - Elucidating Distinct Roles for iNF1i in Melan.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1158_2159-8290.CD-12-0313.pdf,10.1158_2159-8290.CD-12-0313.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1158_2159-8290.CD-12-0313.txt,10.1158_2159-8290.CD-12-0313.txt,"BRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional genetic alterations, tumor development is restricted by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here, we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf–mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase and mTOR. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and show that NF1/neuroﬁbromin inactivation may have an impact on responses to targeted therapies."LUAKSHRP,2011,"Gutmann, D.

These oncogenic pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily applicable to brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental influences on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our laboratories have used neurofibromatosis1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation to the optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize that brain region–specific differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of cAMP promote glioma formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where gliomas rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by forced expression of phosphodiesterase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular lesions with features of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor size in Nf1 GEM in vivo. Together, these results indicate that low levels of cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to promote gliomagenesis, and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for glioma.

Intriguingly, neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients exhibit many of these characteristic skeletal features, including kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis, tibial dysplasia, and pseudarthrosis; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating these phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that hyperactive TGFb1 signaling pivotally underpins osseous defects in Nf1ﬂox/À;Col2.3Cre mice, a model which closely recapitulates the skeletal abnormalities found in the human disease. Compared to controls, we show that serum TGF?b1 levels are ﬁvefold to sixfold increased both in Nf1ﬂox/À;Col2.3Cre mice and in a cohort of NF1 patients. Nf1?deﬁcient osteoblasts, the principal source of TGF?b1 in bone, overexpress TGF?b1 in a gene dosage–dependent fashion. Moreover, Nf1?deﬁcient osteoblasts and osteoclasts are hyperresponsive to TGF?b1 stimulation, potentiating osteoclast bone resorptive activity while inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. These cellular phenotypes are further accompanied by p21?Ras–dependent hyperactivation of the canonical TGF?b1–Smad pathway. Reexpression of the human, fulllength neuroﬁbromin guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)?activating protein (GAP)?related domain (NF1 GRD) in primary Nf1?deﬁcient osteoblast progenitors, attenuated TGF?b1 expression levels and reduced Smad phosphorylation in response to TGF?b1 stimulation. As an in vivo proof of principle, we demonstrate that administration of the TGF?b receptor 1 (TbRI) kinase inhibitor, SD?208, can rescue bone mass deﬁcits and prevent tibial fracture nonunion in Nf1ﬂox/À;Col2.3Cre mice. In sum, these data demonstrate a pivotal role for hyperactive TGF?b1 signaling in the pathogenesis of NF1?associated osteoporosis and pseudarthrosis, thus implicating the TGF?b signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of NF1 osseous defects that are refractory to current therapies. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."I6K854XC,1999,"Vieth, Reinhold","Vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and safety",10.1093/ajcn/69.5.842,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/69/5/842/4714819,5/1/1999,"C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\R2JQ5ZLL\Vieth - 1999 - Vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D con.pdf",grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1093_ajcn_69.5.842.pdf,10.1093_ajcn_69.5.842.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1093_ajcn_69.5.842.txt,10.1093_ajcn_69.5.842.txt,"For adults, the 5-?g (200 IU) vitamin D recommended dietary allowance may prevent osteomalacia in the absence of sunlight, but more is needed to help prevent osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Galectin-7 is a p53-induced gene and an enhancer of apoptosis, whereas galectin-1 induces tumorigenicity and resistance to apoptosis in several types of cancers. We show here that in cells derived from neurofibromin-deficient (Nf1–/–) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), Ras inhibition by S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic-acid (FTS; Salirasib) shifts the pattern of galectin expression. Whereas FTS decreased levels of both active Ras and galectin-1 expression, it dramatically increased both the mRNA and protein expression levels of galectin-7. Galectin-7 accumulation was mediated through JNK inhibition presumably resulting from the observed induction of p53, and was negatively regulated by the AP-1 inhibitor JDP2. Expression of galectin-7 by itself decreased Ras activation in ST88-14 cells and rendered them sensitive to apoptosis. This observed shift in galectin expression pattern together with the accompanying shift from cell proliferation to apoptosis represents a novel pattern of Ras inhibition by FTS. This seems likely to be an important phenomenon in view of the fact that both enhanced cell proliferation and defects of apoptosis constitute major hallmarks of human cancers and play a central role in the resistance of MPNSTs to anti-cancer treatments. These findings suggest that FTS, alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents, may be worth developing as a possible treatment for MPNSTs."LI8L6T79,2015,"Suryani, S.; Bracken, L. S.; Harvey, R.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a non-cell autonomous mechanism in non-malignant NF1 manifestations.

Here, we describe the characterization of the novel small molecule GF-15, a derivative of griseofulvin, as a potent inhibitor of centrosomal clustering in malignant cells.

The NF1-encoded protein is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) [2]. Accordingly, Ras is aberrantly activated in NF1-deﬁcient tumors; however, it is unknown which effector pathways critically function in tumor development. Here we provide in vivo evidence that TORC1/mTOR activity is essential for tumorigenesis. Speciﬁcally, we show that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potently suppresses the growth of aggressive NF1-associated malignancies in a genetically engineered murine model. However, in these tumors rapamycin does not function via mechanisms generally assumed to mediate tumor suppression, including inhibition of HIF-1a and indirect suppression of AKT, but does suppress the mTOR target Cyclin D1 [3]. These results demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors may be an effective targeted therapy for this commonly untreatable malignancy. Moreover, they indicate that mTOR inhibitors do not suppress all tumor types via the same mechanism, suggesting that current biomarkers that rely on HIF-1a suppression may not be informative for all cancers. Finally, our results reveal important differences between the effects of mTOR inhibition on the microvasculature in genetically engineered versus xenograft models and indicate that the former may be required for effective preclinical screening with this class of inhibitors."7GERZKTL,2012,"James, M.

Using NF2-deﬁcient meningioma cells and tumors, together with the normal cellular counterparts that meningiomas derive, arachnoid cells, we identiﬁed merlin as a novel negative regulator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). We now show that merlin positively regulates the kinase activity of mTORC2, a second functionally distinct mTOR complex, and that downstream phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates, including Akt, is reduced upon acute merlin deﬁciency in cells. In response to general growth factor stimulation, Akt signaling is attenuated in merlin RNA interference-suppressed human arachnoid and Schwann cells by mechanisms mediated by hyperactive mTORC1 and impaired mTORC2. Moreover, Akt signaling is impaired differentially in a cell type–dependent manner in response to distinct growth factor stimuli. However, contrary to activation of mTORC1, the attenuated mTORC2 signaling proﬁles exhibited by normal arachnoid and Schwann cells in response to acute merlin loss were not consistently reﬂected in NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas and schwannomas, suggesting additional genetic events may have been acquired in tumors after initial merlin loss. This ﬁnding contrasts with another benign tumor disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, which exhibits attenuated mTORC2 signaling proﬁles in both cells and tumors. Finally, we examined rapamycin, as well as the mTOR kinase inhibitor, Torin1, targeting both mTOR complexes to identify the most efﬁcacious class of compounds for blocking mTORmediated signaling and proliferation in merlin-deﬁcient meningioma cells.

New in vivo MRI-based techniques (multi-exponential T2 relaxation (MET2) and diffusion MR imaging (dMRI)) provide measures relating to microstructural change. We combined these methods and present previously unreported data on in vivo UBO microstructure in NF1. Methods: 3-Tesla dMRI data were acquired on 17 NF1 patients, covering 30 white matter UBOs. Diffusion tensor, kurtosis and neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging parameters were calculated within UBO sites and in contralateral normal appearing white matter (cNAWM). Analysis of MET2 parameters was performed on 24 UBO–cNAWM pairs. Results: No signiﬁcant alterations in the myelin water fraction and intra- and extracellular (IE) water fraction were found. Mean T2 time of IE water was signiﬁcantly higher in UBOs. UBOs furthermore showed increased axial, radial and mean diffusivity, and decreased fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis and neurite density index compared to cNAWM. Neurite orientation dispersion and isotropic ﬂuid fraction were unaltered. Conclusion: Our results suggest that demyelination and axonal degeneration are unlikely to be present in UBOs, which appear to be mainly caused by a shift towards a higher T2-value of the intra- and extracellular water pool. This may arise from altered microstructural compartmentalization, and an increase in ‘extracellular-like’, intracellular water, possibly due to intramyelinic edema.

In two genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However, prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in the development of resistance and reactivation of target pathways.

MPNSTs lack effective treatment options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease recurrence. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI), termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Here, we test MLN8237 against two primary human MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication, which cumulates in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities, so we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with the expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and selfrenewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment significantly reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of spheroid forming cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing of HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and maintain sphere culture. Collectively, our data indicate that AURKA is a rationale therapeutic target for MPNST and tumour cell responses to AKI, which include differentiation, are modulated by the abundance of HMMR/RHAMM."7KBYV8U2,2015,"Vu, Victoria; Verster, Adrian J.; Schertzberg, Michael; Chuluunbaatar, Tungalag; Spensley, Mark; Pajkic, Djina; Hart, G.

To evaluate potential medical therapies for these tumors, we have established a quantiﬁable orthotopic model for NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas. We showed that telomeraseimmortalized Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells harbored a single nucleotide deletion in NF2 exon 7 and did not express the NF2 protein, merlin. We also showed that AR-42, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibited proliferation of both Ben-Men-1 and normal meningeal cells by increasing expression of p16INK4A, p21CIP1/WAF1, and p27KIP1. In addition, AR-42 increased proapoptotic Bim expression and decreased anti-apoptotic BclXL levels. However, AR-42 predominantly arrested Ben-Men-1 cells at G2–M whereas it induced cell-cycle arrest at G1 in meningeal cells. Consistently, AR-42 substantially decreased the levels of cyclin D1, E, and A, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in meningeal cells while signiﬁcantly reducing the expression of cyclin B, important for progression through G2, in Ben-Men-1 cells. In addition, AR-42 decreased Aurora A and B expression. To compare the in vivo efﬁcacies of AR-42 and AR-12, a PDK1 inhibitor, we generated and used luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1-LucB cells to establish intracranial xenografts that grew over time. While AR-12 treatment moderately slowed tumor growth, AR-42 caused regression of Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors. Importantly, AR-42–treated tumors showed minimal regrowth when xenograft-bearing mice were switched to normal diet. Together, these results suggest that AR-42 is a potential therapy for meningiomas. The differential effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle progression of normal meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for why AR-42 is well-tolerated while it potently inhibits tumor growth.

In this study, we carried out high-throughput miRNA expression profiling of human vestibular schwannomas by using an array representing 407 known miRNAs to explore the role of miRNAs in tumor growth. Twelve miRNAs were found to be significantly deregulated in tumor samples as compared with control nerve tissue, defining a schwannoma-typical signature. Among these miRNAs, we focused on miR-7, which was one of the most downregulated in these tumors and has several known oncogene targets, including mRNAs for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1). We found that overexpression of miR-7 inhibited schwannoma cell growth both in culture and in xenograft tumor models in vivo, which correlated with downregulation of these signaling pathways. Furthermore, we identified a novel direct target of miR-7, the mRNA for associated cdc42 kinase 1 (Ack1), with the expression levels of miR-7 and Ack1 being inversely correlated in human schwannoma samples. These results represent the first miRNA profiling of schwannomas and the first report of a tumor suppressor function for miR-7 in these tumors that is mediated by targeting the EGFR, Pak1, and Ack1 oncogenes.

We also highlight the major features of other neurocutaneous syndromes that have ocular findings plus pigmentary, vascular, hyperkeratotic, adnexal, connective tissue, photosensitive, and inflammatory manifestations in the skin."DCDC5PAK,2012,"Carroll, Steven L.",Molecular mechanisms promoting the pathogenesis of Schwann cell neoplasms,10.1007/s00401-011-0928-6,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00401-011-0928-6,2012-03,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\3PB6QSLY\Carroll - 2012 - Molecular mechanisms promoting the pathogenesis of.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\R98TYCH8\Carroll - 2012 - Molecular mechanisms promoting the pathogenesis of.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1007_s00401-011-0928-6.pdf,10.1007_s00401-011-0928-6.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1007_s00401-011-0928-6.txt,10.1007_s00401-011-0928-6.txt,"Neurofibromas, schwannomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) all arise from the Schwann cell lineage. Despite their common origin, these tumor types have distinct pathologies and clinical behaviors; a growing body of evidence indicates that they also arise via distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Identification of the genes that are mutated in genetic diseases characterized by the development of either neurofibromas and MPNSTs [neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)] or schwannomas [neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), schwannomatosis and Carney complex type 1] has greatly advanced our understanding of these mechanisms. The development of genetically engineered mice with ablation of NF1, NF2, SMARCB1/INI1 or PRKAR1A has confirmed the key role these genes play in peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. Establishing the functions of the NF1, NF2, SMARCB1/INI1 and PRKAR1A gene products has led to the identification of key cytoplasmic signaling pathways promoting Schwann cell neoplasia and identified new therapeutic targets. Analyses of human neoplasms and genetically engineered mouse models have established that interactions with other tumor suppressors such as TP53 and CDKN2A promote neurofibroma-MPNST progression and indicate that intratumoral interactions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types play an essential role in peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. Recent advances have also provided new insights into the identity of the neural crest-derived populations that give rise to different types of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Based on these findings, we now have an initial outline of the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of neurofibromas, MPNSTs and schwannomas. However, this improved understanding in turn raises a host of intriguing new questions."QCNFAG86,2013,"Lin, Andrew L.; Gutmann, David H.",Advances in the treatment of neurofibromatosis-associated tumours,10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.144,http://www.nature.com/articles/nrclinonc.2013.144,2013-11,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\MLTFTAA6\Lin and Gutmann - 2013 - Advances in the treatment of neurofibromatosis-ass.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1038_nrclinonc.2013.144.pdf,10.1038_nrclinonc.2013.144.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1038_nrclinonc.2013.144.txt,10.1038_nrclinonc.2013.144.txt,"Neurofibromatosis (NF) comprises two distinct genetic disorders—neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2)—in which affected individuals develop both benign and malignant tumours.

NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17q11.2. Its protein product, neurofibromin, functions as a tumor suppressor and ultimately produces constitutive upregulation of mTOR. TSC is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (chromosome 9q34) or TSC2 (chromosome 16p.13.3) genes. Their protein products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a dimer that acts via the GAP protein Rheb (Ras homolog enhanced in brain) to directly inhibit mTOR, again resulting in upregulation. Specific inhibitors of mTOR are in clinical use, including sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus, and deforolimus. Everolimus has been shown to reduce the volume and appearance of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA), facial angiofibromas, and renal angiomyolipomas associated with TSC, with a recent FDA approval for SEGA not suitable for surgical resection.

Patients often suffer from tissuespecific lesions associated with local double-inactivation of NF1. In this study, we generated a novel fracture model to investigate the mechanism underlying congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) associated with NF1. We used a Cre-expressing adenovirus (AdCre) to inactivate Nf1 in vitro in cultured osteoprogenitors and osteoblasts, and in vivo in the fracture callus of Nf1flox/flox and Nf1flox/À mice. The effects of the presence of Nf1null cells were extensively examined. Cultured Nf1null-committed osteoprogenitors from neonatal calvaria failed to differentiate and express mature osteoblastic markers, even with recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) treatment. Similarly, Nf1null-inducible osteoprogenitors obtained from Nf1Mnuylol D mouse muscle were also unresponsive to rhBMP-2. In both closed and open fracture models in Nf1flox/flox and Nf1flox/À mice, local AdCre injection significantly impaired bone healing, with fracture union being <50% that of wild type controls. No significant difference was seen between Nf1flox/flox and Nf1flox/À mice. Histological analyses showed invasion of the Nf1null fractures by fibrous and highly proliferative tissue. Mean amounts of fibrous tissue were increased upward of 10-fold in Nf1null fractures and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining in closed fractures showed increased numbers of proliferating cells. In Nf1null fractures, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive (TRAP?) cells were frequently observed within the fibrous tissue, not lining a bone surface. In summary, we report that local Nf1 deletion in a fracture callus is sufficient to impair bony union and recapitulate histological features of clinical CPT. Cell culture findings support the concept that Nf1 double inactivation impairs early osteoblastic differentiation.

Currently, surgery is the primary course of treatment for MPNST, but with the limitation that these tumors are highly invasive. Radiation therapy is another treatment option, but is undesirable because it can induce additional mutations. MPNST patients may also receive doxorubicin as therapy, but this DNA-intercalating agent has relatively low tumor specificity and limited efficacy. In this study, we exploited a robust genetically-engineered mouse model of MPNST that recapitulates human NF1 associated MPNST to identify a novel small chemical compound that inhibits tumor cell growth. Compound 21 (Cpd21) inhibits growth of all available in vitro models of MPNST and human MPNST cell lines, while remaining non-toxic to normally-dividing Schwann cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that this compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular apoptosis.

Patients typically develop many tumors over their lifetime, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The NF1 gene, mutated in NF1, is also commonly mutated in sporadic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Because both NF1 and GBM are currently incurable, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Natural products represent an opportunity to develop new therapies, as they have been evolutionarily selected to play targeted roles in organisms. Schweinfurthin A is a prenylated stilbene natural product that has previously shown specific inhibitory activity against brain and hematopoietic tumor lines. We show that patient-derived GBM and NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) lines, as well as tumor lines derived from the Nf1?/+;Trp53?/+ (NPcis) mouse model of astrocytoma and MPNST are highly sensitive to inhibition by schweinfurthin A and its synthetic analogs. In contrast, primary mouse astrocytes are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of schweinfurthin A, suggesting that schweinfurthin A may act specifically on tumor cells. Stable transfection of the GTPase-activating protein related domain of Nf1 into Nf1?/?;Trp53?/? astrocytoma cells confers resistance to schweinfurthin A. In addition, the profound effect of schweinfurthin A on dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton led us to discover that schweinfurthin A inhibits growth factor–stimulated Rho signaling. In summary, we have identified a class of small molecules that specifically inhibit growth of cells from both central and peripheral nervous system tumors and seem to act on NF1deficient cells through cytoskeletal reorganization correlating to changes in Rho signaling.

Among Drosophila melanogaster Nf1 (dNf1) null mutant phenotypes, learning/memory deficits and reduced overall growth resemble human NF1 symptoms. These and other dNf1 defects are relatively insensitive to manipulations that reduce Ras signaling strength but are suppressed by increasing signaling through the 39-59 cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway, or phenocopied by inhibiting this pathway. However, whether dNf1 affects cAMP/PKA signaling directly or indirectly remains controversial. To shed light on this issue we screened 486 1st and 2nd chromosome deficiencies that uncover .80% of annotated genes for dominant modifiers of the dNf1 pupal size defect, identifying responsible genes in crosses with mutant alleles or by tissue-specific RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown. Validating the screen, identified suppressors include the previously implicated dAlk tyrosine kinase, its activating ligand jelly belly (jeb), two other genes involved in Ras/ERK signal transduction and several involved in cAMP/PKA signaling. Novel modifiers that implicate synaptic defects in the dNf1 growth deficiency include the intersectin-related synaptic scaffold protein Dap160 and the cholecystokinin receptor-related CCKLR-17D1 drosulfakinin receptor. Providing mechanistic clues, we show that dAlk, jeb and CCKLR-17D1 are among mutants that also suppress a recently identified dNf1 neuromuscular junction (NMJ) overgrowth phenotype and that manipulations that increase cAMP/PKA signaling in adipokinetic hormone (AKH)-producing cells at the base of the neuroendocrine ring gland restore the dNf1 growth deficiency.

In recent years, a number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of these tumors. These models have been designed to address key questions including: 1) whether NF1 loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis; 2) what cell type(s) in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs; 3) how the tumor microenvironment contributes to neoplasia; 4) what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-MPNST progression; 5) what role different neurofibromin-regulated Ras proteins play in this process and 6) how dysregulated growth factor signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis.

We also discuss how information gleaned from these models can be synthesized to into a comprehensive model of tumor formation in peripheral nervous system and consider several of the major questions that remain unanswered about this process."WJAGJVW6,2014,"Chen, Zhiguo; Liu, Chiachi; Patel, Amish J.; Liao, Chung-Ping; Wang, Yong; Le, Lu Q.",Cells of Origin in the Embryonic Nerve Roots for NF1-Associated Plexiform Neurofibroma,10.1016/j.ccell.2014.09.009,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610814003729,2014-11,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\HYSKV3QA\Chen et al. - 2014 - Cells of Origin in the Embryonic Nerve Roots for N.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.ccell.2014.09.009.pdf,10.1016_j.ccell.2014.09.009.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.ccell.2014.09.009.txt,10.1016_j.ccell.2014.09.009.txt,"Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 is a tumor-predisposing genetic disorder.

The NF2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of membrane/F-actin linkers. Merlin resists solubilization by the detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100), a property commonly attributed to association with the cytoskeleton. Accordingly, NF2 patient mutations that encode merlins with enhanced TX-100 solubility have been explained previously in terms of loss of cytoskeletal attachment. However, here we present data to suggest that the detergent resistance of merlin is a result of its constitutive residence in lipid rafts. Furthermore, when cells are grown to high density, merlin shifts to a more buoyant lipid raft fraction in a density gradient. This shift is mimicked in subconfluent cells treated with cytochalasin D, suggesting that the shift results from merlin dissociation from the actin cytoskeleton, but not from lipid rafts. Intramolecular NH2- and COOH-terminal binding, which occurs when merlin transitions to the growth-suppressive form, also brings about a similar change in buoyant density. Our results suggest that constitutive residence of merlin in lipid rafts is crucial for its function and that as merlin becomes growth suppressive in vivo, one significant molecular event may be the loss of interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. To our knowledge, merlin is the first tumor suppressor known to reside within lipid rafts, and the significance of this finding is underscored by known loss-of-function NF2 patient mutations that encode merlins with enhanced TX-100 solubility."TKE6BNIH,2008,"Lepont, Pierig; Stickney, John T.; Foster, Lauren A.; Meng, Jin-Jun; Hennigan, Robert F.; Ip, Wallace",Point mutation in the NF2 gene of HEI-193 human schwannoma cells results in the expression of a merlin isoform with attenuated growth suppressive activity,10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.07.015,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0027510707003119,2008-01,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\7SYN3KFD\Lepont et al. - 2008 - Point mutation in the NF2 gene of HEI-193 human sc.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.mrfmmm.2007.07.015.pdf,10.1016_j.mrfmmm.2007.07.015.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.mrfmmm.2007.07.015.txt,10.1016_j.mrfmmm.2007.07.015.txt,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of bilateral schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve.

The availability of isolated tumor cells would facilitate a better understanding of the molecular function of merlin, but primary schwannoma cells obtained from patients grow slowly and do not yield adequate numbers for biochemical analysis. In this study, we have examined the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from the schwannoma of an NF2 patient. Previous work showed that the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells causes a splicing defect in the NF2 transcript. We have confirmed this result and further identified the resultant protein product as an isoform of merlin previously designated as isoform 3. The level of isoform 3 protein in HEI-193 cells is comparable to the levels of merlin isoforms 1 and 2 in normal human Schwann cells and several other immortalized cell lines. In contrast to many mutant forms of merlin, isoform 3 is as resistant to proteasomal degradation as isoforms 1 and 2 and can interact with each of these isoforms in vivo. Cell proliferation assays showed that, in NF2?/? mouse embryonic fibroblasts, exogenously expressed merlin isoform 3 does exhibit growth suppressive activity although it is significantly lower than that of identically expressed merlin isoform 1. These results indicate that, although HEI-193 cells have undetectable levels of merlin isoforms 1 and 2, they are, in fact, not a merlin-null model because they express the moderately active growth-suppressive merlin isoform 3."YWXUMYQ4,2009,"Evans, D Gareth R",Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2): A clinical and molecular review,10.1186/1750-1172-4-16,http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-4-16,2009,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\GTS8DNHL\Evans - 2009 - Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) A clinical and mol.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_1750-1172-4-16.pdf,10.1186_1750-1172-4-16.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_1750-1172-4-16.txt,10.1186_1750-1172-4-16.txt,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumour-prone disorder characterised by the development of multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. Prevalence (initially estimated at 1: 200,000) is around 1 in 60,000. Affected individuals inevitably develop schwannomas, typically affecting both vestibular nerves and leading to hearing loss and deafness. The majority of patients present with hearing loss, which is usually unilateral at onset and may be accompanied or preceded by tinnitus. Vestibular schwannomas may also cause dizziness or imbalance as a first symptom. Nausea, vomiting or true vertigo are rare symptoms, except in late-stage disease. The other main tumours are schwannomas of the other cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves; meningiomas both intracranial (including optic nerve meningiomas) and intraspinal, and some low-grade central nervous system malignancies (ependymomas). Ophthalmic features are also prominent and include reduced visual acuity and cataract. About 70% of NF2 patients have skin tumours (intracutaneous plaque-like lesions or more deep-seated subcutaneous nodular tumours). Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a dominantly inherited tumour predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. More than 50% of patients represent new mutations and as many as one-third are mosaic for the underlying disease-causing mutation. Although truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshifts) are the most frequent germline event and cause the most severe disease, single and multiple exon deletions are common. A strategy for detection of the latter is vital for a sensitive analysis. Diagnosis is based on clinical and neuroimaging studies. Presymptomatic genetic testing is an integral part of the management of NF2 families. Prenatal diagnosis and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is possible. The main differential diagnosis of NF2 is schwannomatosis. NF2 represents a difficult management problem with most patients facing substantial morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Surgery remains the focus of current management although watchful waiting with careful surveillance and occasionally radiation treatment have a role. Prognosis is adversely affected by early age at onset, a higher number of meningiomas and having a truncating mutation. In the future, the development of tailored drug therapies aimed at the genetic level are likely to provide huge improvements for this devastating condition."VQW4WPZE,2015,"Chow, Hoi-Yee; Dong, Biao; Duron, Sergio G.; Campbell, David A.; Ong, Christy C.; Hoeflich, Klaus P.; Chang, Long-Sheng; Welling, D.

We found that these Pak inhibitors suppressed the proliferation and motility of both benign (Ben-Men1) and malignant (KT21-MG1) meningiomas cells. In addition, we found a strong reduction in phosphorylation of Mek and S6, and decreased cyclin D1 expression in both cell lines after treatment with Pak inhibitors. Using intracranial xenografts of luciferase-expressing KT21-MG1 cells, we found that treated mice showed significant tumor suppression for all three Pak inhibitors.

Furthermore, although much has been done to understand how merlin, the NF2 gene product, functions as a tumor suppressor gene in schwannoma cells, the functional role of merlin in the tumor microenvironment and the mechanism(s) by which merlin regulates angiogenesis to support schwannoma growth is largely unexplored. Here we report that the expression of semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) was specifically downregulated in schwannoma cells lacking merlin/NF2. When we reintroduced SEMA3F in schwannoma cells, we observed normalized tumor blood vessels, reduced tumor burden, and extended survival in nude mice bearing merlin-deficient brain tumors. Next, using chemical inhibitors and gene knockdown with RNA interference, we found that merlin regulated expression of SEMA3F through Rho GTPase family member Rac1. This study shows that, in addition to the tumor-suppressing activity of merlin, it also functions to maintain physiological angiogenesis in the nervous system by regulating antiangiogenic factors such as SEMA3F. Restoring the relative balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, such as increases in SEMA3F, in schwannoma microenvironment may represent a novel strategy to alleviate the clinical symptoms of NF2-related schwannomas."G25BDEY3,2011,"Zhou, Lu; Ercolano, Emanuela; Ammoun, Sylwia; Schmid, M.

However, the mechanism by which loss of contact inhibition leads to proliferation remains obscure in merlin-deficient tumors. In this study, we show that proliferative Wnt/?-catenin signaling is elevated as active ?-catenin (dephosphorylated at serine 37 and threoine 41) localizes to the nucleus and the Wnt targets genes c-myc and cyclin D1 are upregulated in confluent human schwannoma cells. We demonstrate that Rac effector p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) is essential for the activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling because depletion of PAK2 suppressed active ?-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1. Most importantly, the link between the loss of the AJ complex and the increased proliferation in human schwannoma cells is connected by Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor–induced tyrosine 654 phosphorylation on ?-catenin and associated with degradation of N-cadherin. We also demonstrate that active merlin maintains ?-catenin and N-cadherin complex at the plasma membrane through direct regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 654 is critical for the increased proliferation in human schwannoma cells because overexpression of a Y654F mutant ?-catenin reduces hyperproliferation of schwannoma cells.

Recent progress in understanding the biology of neuroﬁbromin suggested that NF1 pseudarthrosis stems primarily from defects in the bone mesenchymal lineage and hypersensitivity of hematopoietic cells to TGFb. However, clinically relevant pharmacological approaches to augment bone union in these patients remain limited. In this study, we report the generation of a novel conditional mutant mouse line used to model NF1 pseudoarthrosis, in which Nf1 can be ablated in an inducible fashion in osteoprogenitors of postnatal mice, thus circumventing the dwarﬁsm associated with previous mouse models where Nf1 is ablated in embryonic mesenchymal cell lineages. An ex vivo–based cell culture approach based on the use of Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox bone marrow stromal cells showed that loss of Nf1 impairs osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in a cell?autonomous manner, independent of developmental growth plate–derived or paracrine/hormonal inﬂuences. In addition, in vitro gene expression and differentiation assays indicated that chronic ERK activation in Nf1?deﬁcient osteoprogenitors blunts the pro?osteogenic property of BMP2, based on the observation that only combination treatment with BMP2 and MEK inhibition promoted the differentiation of Nf1?deﬁcient osteoprogenitors.

We analyzed cortical bone tissue in two conditional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1, for morphological and molecular effects. Backscattered electron microscopy revealed signiﬁcantly enlarged osteocyte lacunae in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice (level E2: ctrl = 1.90 ± 0.52%, Nf1Prx1 = 3.40 ± 0.95%; ctrl 1.60 ± 0.47%, Nf1Col1 2.46 ± 0.91%). Moreover, the osteocyte lacunae appeared misshaped in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice as indicated by increased Feret ratios. Strongest osteocyte and dendritic network disorganization was observed in proximity of muscle attachment sites in Nf1Prx1 humeri. In contrast to control cells, Nf1Prx1 osteocytes contained abundant cytosolic vacuoles and accumulated immature organic matrix within the perilacunar space, a phenotype reminiscent of the hyperosteoidosis shown Nf1 deﬁcient mice. Cortical bone lysates further revealed approx. twofold upregulated MAPK signalling in osteocytes of Nf1Prx1 mice. This was associated with transcriptional downregulation of collagens and genes involved in mechanical sensing in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 bone tissue. In contrast, matrix gla protein (MGP), phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX), and genes involved in lipid metabolism were upregulated. In line with previously described hyperactivation of Nf1 deﬁcient osteoblasts, systemic plasma levels of the bone formation markers osteocalcin (OCN) and procollagen typ I N-propeptide (PINP) were approx. twofold increased in Nf1Prx1 mice. Histochemical and molecular analysis ascertained that osteocytes in Nf1Prx1 cortical bone were viable and did not undergo apoptosis or autophagy. We conclude that loss of neuroﬁbromin is not only critical for osteoblasts but also hinders normal osteocyte development.

Second, it also regulates Rho-dependent (Ras-independent) changes by activating LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2), an enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin (an actin-depolymerizing factor). Third, the pre-GRD domain acts through the Rac1 GTPase, that activate the P21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-LIMK1-cofilin pathway. We employed molecular modeling to identify a novel inhibitor of LIMK1/2. The active sites of an ephrin-A receptor (EphA3) and LIMK2 showed marked similarity (60%). On testing a known inhibitor of EphA3, we found that it fits to the LIMK1/2-ATP binding site and to the latter’s substrate-binding pockets. We identified a similar compound, T56-LIMKi, and found that it inhibits LIMK1/2 kinase activities. It blocked the phosphorylation of cofilin which led to actin severance and inhibition of tumor cell migration, tumor cell growth, and anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar. Because modulation of LIMK by neurofibromin is not affected by the Ras inhibitor Salirasib, we examined the combined effect of Salirasib and T56-LIMKi each of which can affect cell motility by a distinct pathway.

Here, we used MPNST cell lines and selective Ras inhibition with S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic-acid (FTS; salirasib) in conjunction with specific inhibitors of TGF-b and BMP signaling. FTS perturbed signaling of BMP4 and TGF-b1 to Smad-dependent and Erk-dependent pathways. Furthermore, FTS inhibited motility and spreading, reduced the gelatinase secretion, eliminated the expression and activation of regulators of cell–matrix interaction, and altered gene expression. These phenomena are indicative of a phenotypic reversion of NF1-defficient cells by FTS. Inhibition of BMP4 and TGF-b by noggin and SB-431542, respectively, mimicked the FTS-mediated effects on adhesion, spreading, and cell morphology. This strongly suggests that a cross-talk among TGF-b superfamily ligands and Ras plays a significant role in the transformation of NF1À/– MPNSTs. Our results support the therapeutic potential of FTS, in conjuncture with BMP and TGF-b pathway inhibitors, toward the inhibition of mitogenic and morphogenic signaling pathways and the alleviation of NF1 symptoms.

Accordingly, aberrant RAS activation underlies the pathogenesis of NF1-mutant cancers. Nevertheless, it is unclear which RAS pathway components represent optimal therapeutic targets. Here, we identify mTORC1 as the key PI3K effector in NF1-mutant nervous system malignancies and conversely show that mTORC2 and AKT are dispensable. However, we find that tumor regression requires sustained inhibition of both mTORC1 and MEK. Transcriptional profiling studies were therefore used to establish a signature of effective mTORC1–MEK inhibition in vivo. We unexpectedly found that the glucose transporter GLUT1 was potently suppressed, but only when both pathways were inhibited. Moreover, unlike VHL- and LKB1-mutant cancers, reduction of 18F-FDG uptake required the suppression of both mTORC1 and MEK. Together, these studies identify optimal and suboptimal therapeutic targets in NF1-mutant malignancies and define a noninvasive means of measuring combined mTORC1–MEK inhibition in vivo, which can be readily incorporated into clinical trials."XE9IFUUL,2015,"Kolberg, Matthias; Høland, Maren; Lind, Guro E.; Ågesen, Trude H.; Skotheim, Rolf I.; Sundby Hall, Kirsten; Mandahl, Nils; Smeland, Sigbjørn; Mertens, Fredrik; Davidson, Ben; Lothe, Ragnhild A.","Protein expression of BIRC5, TK1, and TOP2A in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours - A prognostic test after surgical resection",10.1016/j.molonc.2015.02.005,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/j.molonc.2015.02.005,2015-06,"C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\B2UVGKZC\Kolberg et al. - 2015 - Protein expression of BIRC5, TK1, and TOP2A in mal.pdf",grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.molonc.2015.02.005.pdf,10.1016_j.molonc.2015.02.005.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.molonc.2015.02.005.txt,10.1016_j.molonc.2015.02.005.txt,"No consensus treatment regime exists beyond surgery for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST), and the purpose of the present study was to ﬁnd new approaches to stratify patients with good and poor prognosis and to better guide therapeutic intervention for this aggressive soft tissue cancer."PQKFI5UD,2012,"Ferrero, Giovanni Battista; Picco, Gabriele; Baldassarre, Giuseppina; Flex, Elisabetta; Isella, Claudio; Cantarella, Daniela; Corà, Davide; Chiesa, Nicoletta; Crescenzio, Nicoletta; Timeus, Fabio; Merla, Giuseppe; Mazzanti, Laura; Zampino, Giuseppe; Rossi, Cesare; Silengo, Margherita; Tartaglia, Marco; Medico, Enzo",Transcriptional hallmarks of noonan syndrome and noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair,10.1002/humu.22026,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/humu.22026,2012-04,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\D4U5HGI3\Ferrero et al. - 2012 - Transcriptional hallmarks of noonan syndrome and n.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\7BAVG7W9\Ferrero et al. - 2012 - Transcriptional hallmarks of noonan syndrome and n.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1002_humu.22026.pdf,10.1002_humu.22026.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1002_humu.22026.txt,10.1002_humu.22026.txt,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is among the most common nonchromosomal disorders affecting development and growth.

Deficits in the Notch pathway are responsible for Alagille [4] and Cadasil syndromes [5], which are associated with mental retardation and dementia. Additionally, in postmitotic neurons, Notch proteins interact with presenilins [6-9] and with ?-amyloid precursor protein [10] and could therefore have a role in the memory deficits associated with familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. To test if alterations in Notch signaling can lead to learning and memory deficits, we studied mice with mutations in this pathway. Here, we show that null heterozygous mutations in Notch1 result in deficits in spatial learning and memory without affecting other forms of learning, motor control, or exploratory activity. We also show that null heterozygous mutations in the downstream cofactor RBP-J result in similarly specific spatial learning and memory deficits. These data indicate that a constitutive decrease in Notch signaling can result in specific learning and memory deficits and suggest that abnormalities in Notch-dependent transcription may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease and Alagille and Cadasil syndromes."DGYFPYJZ,2006,"Graf, Anna; Landolt, Markus A.; Mori, Andrea Capone; Boltshauser, Eugen",Quality of life and psychological adjustment in children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis type 1,10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.04.025,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022347606003428,2006-09,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\MC4CUMBM\Graf et al. - 2006 - Quality of life and psychological adjustment in ch.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.jpeds.2006.04.025.pdf,10.1016_j.jpeds.2006.04.025.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.jpeds.2006.04.025.txt,10.1016_j.jpeds.2006.04.025.txt,"Objective To assess quality of life (QoL) and psychological adjustment in children and adolescents with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Predictive values of sociodemographic variables, illness-related variables, and family-related variables for quality of life and psychological adjustment were assessed. Results Most dimensions of QoL in NF1 children and adolescents were different from reference values. Deviations in the NF1 group were an impairment of motor, cognitive, and social functioning and a reduction of positive and negative emotions. Also, psychological adjustment in patients with NF1 was signiﬁcantly impaired compared with normal subjects. Illness-related variables had a negative impact on the emotional domain of QoL. Good family relationships positively affected both QoL and psychological adjustment. Conclusions QoL and psychological adjustment are impaired in children and adolescents with NF1.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional analysis of a prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary-care children’s hospital. Children with an OPG (sporadic or secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1) who were cooperative for visual acuity testing, but required sedation to complete magnetic resonance imaging, underwent HH-OCT imaging of the circumpapillary RNFL while sedated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the average and quadrant-specific RNFL thicknesses. RESULTS Thirty-three children (64 eyes) met inclusion criteria (median age, 4.8 years; range, 1.8-12.6 years). In children with vision loss (abnormal visual acuity and/or visual field), RNFL thickness was decreased in all quadrants compared with the normal-vision group (P < .001 for all comparisons). Using abnormal criteria of less than 5% and less than 1%, the area under the curve was highest for the average RNFL thickness (0.96 and 0.97, respectively) compared with specific anatomic quadrants. The highest discrimination and predictive values were demonstrated for participants with 2 or more quadrants meeting less than 5% (sensitivity = 93.3; specificity = 97.9; positive predictive value = 93.3; and negative predictive value = 97.9) and less than 1% (sensitivity = 93.3; specificity = 100; positive predictive value = 100; and negative predictive value = 98.0) criteria. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Measures of RNFL thickness acquired with HH-OCT during sedation can differentiate between young children with and without vision loss from OPGs. For young children who do not cooperate with vision testing, HH-OCT measures may be a surrogate marker of vision. Longitudinal studies are needed to delineate the temporal relationship between RNFL decline and vision loss."MYB9D8TI,2016,"Hanemann, C.

PNs that cause airway compromise or pulmonary dysfunction are uncommon but clinically important. Because improvement in sleep quality or airway function represents direct clinical benefit, measures of sleep and pulmonary function may be more meaningful than tumor size as endpoints in therapeutic clinical trials targeting airway PN. Methods: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis functional outcomes group reviewed currently available endpoints for sleep and pulmonary outcomes and developed consensus recommendations for response evaluation in NF clinical trials. Results: For patients with airway PNs, polysomnography, impulse oscillometry, and spirometry should be performed to identify abnormal function that will be targeted by the agent under clinical investigation. The functional group endorsed the use of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as the primary sleep endpoint, and pulmonary resistance at 10 Hz (R10) or forced expiratory volume in 1 or 0.75 seconds (FEV1 or FEV0.75) as primary pulmonary endpoints. The group defined minimum changes in AHI, R10, and FEV1 or FEV0.75 for response criteria. Secondary sleep outcomes include desaturation and hypercapnia during sleep and arousal index. Secondary pulmonary outcomes include pulmonary resistance and reactance measurements at 5, 10, and 20 Hz; forced vital capacity; peak expiratory flow; and forced expiratory flows. Conclusions: These recommended sleep and pulmonary evaluations are intended to provide researchers with a standardized set of clinically meaningful endpoints for response evaluation in trials of NF1-related airway PNs.

Methods: The relationship between the type and location of the germline NF1 mutation and the presence of a glioma was analyzed in 37 participants with NF1 from one institution (Washington University School of Medicine [WUSM]) with a clinical diagnosis of NF1. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using both unadjusted and weighted analyses of this data set in combination with 4 previously published data sets. Results: While no statistical significance was observed between the location and type of the NF1 mutation and glioma in the WUSM cohort, power calculations revealed that a sample size of 307 participants would be required to determine the predictive value of the position or type of the NF1 gene mutation. Combining our data set with 4 previously published data sets (n 5 310), children with glioma were found to be more likely to harbor 59-end gene mutations (OR 5 2; p 5 0.006). Moreover, while not clinically predictive due to insufficient sensitivity and specificity, this association with glioma was stronger for participants with 59-end truncating (OR 5 2.32; p 5 0.005) or 59-end nonsense (OR 5 3.93; p 5 0.005) mutations relative to those without glioma. Conclusions: Individuals with NF1 and glioma are more likely to harbor nonsense mutations in the 59 end of the NF1 gene, suggesting that the NF1 mutation may be one predictive factor for glioma in this at-risk population.

Methods: Pre-enrollment characteristics and complications of PN were retrospectively analyzed in a cohort of 59 children with NF1-related PN treated on 1 of 7 clinical trials at the NIH between 1996 and 2007. Outcome was analyzed in a subset of 19 patients enrolled in phase I trials. Comparisons to children with cancer were made from a similar analysis performed recently. Results: The median age at enrollment was 8 years. The median PN volume was 555 mL. Most patients had no prior chemotherapy or radiation, but nearly half had previous surgery for PN. PN-associated complications and NF1 manifestations were common, including pain (53%), other tumors (18%), and hypertension (8%). Investigational drug therapy was well tolerated. A median of 10 treatment cycles was administered. Patients with NF1-related PN were younger, had better performance score, had less prior therapy, and remained on study longer than cancer patients.

Methods: We included patients 25 years of age and younger with PNs entered in a natural history study or in treatment trials who had volumetric MRI over ?16 months. Results: We studied 49 patients (median age 8.3 years) with 61 PNs and a median evaluation period of 34 months (range 18 to 70). The PN growth rates varied among patients, but were constant within patients. Thirty-four patients (69%) experienced ?20% increase in PN volume during the observation period. PN volume increased more rapidly than body weight over time (p ? 0.026). Younger patients had the most rapid PN growth rate. Conclusions: Volume increase of plexiform neurofibromas is a realistic and meaningful trial endpoint. In most patients plexiform neurofibroma growth rate exceeded body growth rate. The youngest patients had the fastest plexiform neurofibroma growth rate, and clinical drug development should be directed toward this population. Age stratification for clinical trials for plexiform neurofibromas should be considered."7Y2IJUWE,2016,"Wolters, Pamela L.; Martin, Staci; Merker, Vanessa L.; Tonsgard, James H.; Solomon, Sondra E.; Baldwin, Andrea; Bergner, Amanda L.; Walsh, Karin; Thompson, Heather L.; Gardner, Kathy L.; Hingtgen, Cynthia M.; Schorry, Elizabeth; Dudley, William N.; Franklin, Barbara; For the REiNS International Collaboration",Patient-reported outcomes of pain and physical functioning in neurofibromatosis clinical trials,10.1212/WNL.0000000000002927,http://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000002927,8/16/2016,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\VWPKKZAN\Wolters et al. - 2016 - Patient-reported outcomes of pain and physical fun.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1212_WNL.0000000000002927.pdf,10.1212_WNL.0000000000002927.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1212_WNL.0000000000002927.txt,10.1212_WNL.0000000000002927.txt,"Objective: Tumors and other disease complications of neurofibromatosis (NF) can cause pain and negatively affect physical functioning. To document the clinical benefit of treatment in NF trials targeting these manifestations, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and physical functioning should be included as study endpoints. Currently, there is no consensus on the selection and use of such measures in the NF population. This article presents the recommendations of the PRO group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration for assessing the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials. Methods: The REiNS PRO group reviewed and rated existing PRO measures assessing pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning using their systematic method. Final recommendations are based primarily on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for clinical trials. Results: The REiNS PRO group chose the Numeric Rating Scale–11 ($8 years) to assess pain intensity, the Pain Interference Index (6–24 years) and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference Scale ($18 years) to evaluate pain interference, and the PROMIS Physical Functioning Scale to measure upper extremity function and mobility ($5 years) for NF clinical trials. Conclusions: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these PRO measures to assess the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials; however, further research is needed to evaluate their use in individuals with NF. A final consensus recommendation for the pain interference measure will be disseminated in a future publication based on findings from additional published research.

Methods: A systematic process was used to review all published data about WB-MRI in NF syndromes to assess diagnostic accuracy, feasibility and reproducibility, and data about specific techniques for assessment of tumor burden, characterization of neoplasms, and response to therapy. Results: WB-MRI at 1.5T or 3.0T is feasible for image acquisition. Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence is used in all investigations to date, suggesting consensus about the utility of this sequence for detection of WB tumor burden in people with NF. There are insufficient data to support a consensus statement about the optimal imaging planes (axial vs coronal) or 2D vs 3D approaches. Functional imaging, although used in some NF studies, has not been systematically applied or evaluated. There are no comparative studies between regional vs WB-MRI or evaluations of WB-MRI reproducibility. Conclusions: WB-MRI is feasible for identifying tumors using both 1.5T and 3.0T systems. The STIR sequence is a core sequence.

In this study, we identified Sip1 as a Drosophila orthologue of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) binding protein 50 (EBP50; also known as the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor NHERF1). In mammals, EBP50/NHERF1 is a scaffold protein required for the regulation of several transmembrane receptors and downstream signal transduction activity. In Drosophila, loss of Sip1 leads to a reduction in Slik kinase protein abundance, loss of Moesin phosphorylation and changes in epithelial structure, including mislocalization of E-cadherin and Factin. Consistent with these findings, Moesin and Sip1 act synergistically in genetic-interaction experiments, and Sip1 protein abundance is dependent on Moesin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Sip1 forms a complex with both Moesin and Slik. Taken together, these data suggest that Sip1 promotes Slik-dependent phosphorylation of Moesin, and suggests a mechanism for the regulation of Moesin activity within the cell to maintain epithelial integrity."BHQF9RI8,2012,"Thangarajh, M.; Gutmann, D.

This interplay between preneoplastic/neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic stromal cells is nicely illustrated by the neuroﬁbromatosis type 1-inherited cancer syndrome, in which affected children develop low-grade astrocytic gliomas. In this review, we will use neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 as a model system to highlight the critical role of growth control pathways, non-neoplastic cellular elements and brain region-speciﬁc properties in the development of childhood gliomas.

The human HEI193 and murine Nf 2?/? cell lines were implanted between the pia and arachnoid meninges as well as in the sciatic nerve to mimic central and peripheral schwannomas. Mice were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/wk i.v.) or vandetanib (50 mg/kg/d orally) to block the VEGF pathway. Using intravital and confocal microscopy, together with whole-body imaging, we measured tumor growth delay, survival rate, as well as blood vessel structure and function at regular intervals.

After 2 weeks of treatment, necrosis in HEI193 tumors and apoptosis in Nf 2?/? tumors were significantly increased, and the tumor growth rate decreased by an average of 50%. The survival of mice bearing intracranial schwannomas was extended by at least 50%. This study shows that anti-VEGF therapy normalizes the vasculature of schwannoma xenografts in nude mice and successfully controls the tumor growth, probably by reestablishing a natural balance between VEGF and semaphorin 3 signaling.

Enlarged brain white matter tracts correlated with myelin decompaction, downregulation of claudin11, and mislocalization of connexin-32.

C59 blocked progression of mammary tumors in MMTV-WNT1 transgenic mice while downregulating Wnt/b-catenin target genes. Surprisingly, mice exhibit no apparent toxicity, such that at a therapeutically effective dose there were no pathologic changes in the gut or other tissues. These results offer preclinical proof-of-concept that inhibiting mammalian Wnts can be achieved by targeting PORCN with small-molecule inhibitors such as C59, and that this is a safe and feasible strategy in vivo.

Although the cAMP–PKA signaling system was the ﬁrst mammalian second messenger system to be characterized, many aspects of this pathway are still not well understood. Owing to ﬁndings over the past decade implicating PKA signaling in endocrine (and other) tumorigenesis, there has been renewed interest in understanding the role of this pathway in physiology, particularly as it pertains to the endocrine system. Because of the availability of genetic tools, mouse modeling has become the pre-eminent system for studying the physiological role of speciﬁc genes and gene families as a means to understanding their relationship to human diseases. In this review, we will summarize the current data regarding mouse models that have targeted the PKA signaling system. These data have led to a better understanding of both the complexity and the subtlety of PKA signaling, and point the way for future studies, which may help to modulate this pathway for therapeutic effect."42GJYCST,2013,"Pachl, Fiona; Plattner, Patrik; Ruprecht, Benjamin; Médard, Guillaume; Sewald, Norbert; Kuster, Bernhard",Characterization of a Chemical Affinity Probe Targeting Akt Kinases,10.1021/pr400455j,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr400455j,8/2/2013,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\NRUXPJ4E\Pachl et al. - 2013 - Characterization of a Chemical Affinity Probe Targ.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1021_pr400455j.pdf,10.1021_pr400455j.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1021_pr400455j.txt,10.1021_pr400455j.txt,"Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular processes, and aberrant function is often associated with human disease.

Patients and Methods A total of 167 untreated eligible patients enrolled onto the Italian and German studies between 1975 and 1998 entered this analysis. Seventeen percent of patients had neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). Chemotherapy was administered to 74% of patients; radiotherapy was administered to 38% of patients. Results With a median follow-up of 7 years, 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 51% and 37%, respectively. The 5-year OS and PFS by Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) groupings were as follows: group I, 82% and 61%; group II, 62% and 37%; group III, 32% and 27%; group IV, 26% and 21%, respectively. Univariate analysis identiﬁed IRS groups, size, invasiveness, primary site, age, and presence of NF1 as prognostic factors; multivariate analysis identiﬁed absence of NF1, tumor invasiveness T1, IRS groups I to II and extremity of primary site as independent favorable factors for OS. A trend was observed toward a beneﬁt from radiotherapy after initial gross resection. The overall response rate to primary chemotherapy, including minor responses, in group III patients was 45%. Conclusion MPNST is an aggressive tumor for which complete surgical resection is the mainstay of successful treatment. Postoperative radiotherapy may have a role in improving local control in patients with minimal residual tumor. The reported responses to primary chemotherapy suggest that it may be effective in patients with tumor considered unresectable at diagnosis."9YJI3NP6,2008,"Hu-Lowe, D. D.; Zou, H. Y.; Grazzini, M.

We provide a comprehensive description of its in vitro characteristics and activities, in vivo antiangiogenesis, and antitumor efficacy and translational pharmacology data. Experimental Design: The potency, kinase selectivity, pharmacologic activity, and antitumor efficacy of axitinib were assessed in various nonclinical models. Results: Axitinib inhibits cellular autophosphorylation of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) with picomolar IC50 values. Counterscreening across multiple kinase and protein panels shows it is selective for VEGFRs. Axitinib blocks VEGF-mediated endothelial cell survival, tube formation, and downstream signaling through endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Following twice daily oral administration, axitinib produces consistent and dose-dependent antitumor efficacy that is associated with blocking VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and concomitant induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Axitinib in combination with chemotherapeutic or targeted agents enhances antitumor efficacy in many tumor models compared with single agent alone. Dose scheduling studies in a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model show that simultaneous administration of axitinib and gemcitabine without prolonged dose interruption or truncation of axitinib produces the greatest antitumor efficacy. The efficacious drug concentrations predicted in nonclinical studies are consistent with the range achieved in the clinic. Although axitinib inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors and KIT with nanomolar in vitro potencies, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, axitinib acts primarily as a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor at the current clinical exposure. Conclusions: The selectivity, potency for VEGFRs, and robust nonclinical activity may afford broad opportunities for axitinib to improve cancer therapy."SL9T4JDF,2012,"Wong, H.; Vernillet, L.; Peterson, A.; Ware, J.

Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) modeling was used to relate GDC-0973 plasma and tumor concentrations, tumor pharmacodynamics and antitumor efﬁcacy to establish pharmacokinetic endpoints and predict active doses in the clinic. Experimental Design: A PK–PD model was used to characterize GDC-0973 tumor disposition and in vivo potency in WM-266-4 xenograft mice. Simulations were conducted using the PK–PD model along with human pharmacokinetics to identify a target plasma concentration and predict active doses. In vivo potency and antitumor efﬁcacy were characterized in A375 melanoma xenograft mice, and a population-based integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy model was used to relate tumor pharmacodynamics (%pERK decrease) to antitumor activity. Results: GDC-0973 showed a sustained tumor pharmacodynamic response due to longer residence in tumor than in plasma. Following single doses of GDC-0973, estimated in vivo IC50 values of %pERK decrease based on tumor concentrations in xenograft mice were 0.78 (WM-266-4) and 0.52 mmol/L (A375). Following multiple doses of GDC-0973, the estimated in vivo IC50 value in WM-266-4 increased (3.89 mmol/L). Human simulations predicted a minimum target plasma concentration of 83 nmol/L and an active dose range of 28 to 112 mg. The steep relationship between tumor pharmacodynamics (%pERK decrease) and antitumor efﬁcacy suggests a pathway modulation threshold beyond which antitumor efﬁcacy switches on. Conclusions: Clinical observations of %pERK decrease and antitumor activity were consistent with model predictions. This article illustrates how PK–PD modeling can improve the translation of preclinical data to humans by providing a means to integrate preclinical and early clinical data.

Experimental Design: We constructed dual-acting inhibitors by incorporating HDAC inhibitory functionality into a PI3K inhibitor pharmacophore. CUDC-907, a development candidate selected from these dual inhibitors, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo to determine its pharmacologic properties, anticancer activity, and mechanism of action. Results: CUDC-907 potently inhibits class I PI3Ks as well as classes I and II HDAC enzymes. Through its integrated HDAC inhibitory activity, CUDC-907 durably inhibits the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and compensatory signaling molecules such as RAF, MEK, MAPK, and STAT-3, as well as upstream receptor tyrosine kinases. CUDC-907 shows greater growth inhibition and proapoptotic activity than single-target PI3K or HDAC inhibitors in both cultured and implanted cancer cells.

To identify survivalassociated genomic biomarkers, we performed high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a large set of MPNSTs. Experimental Design: Candidate gene alterations identified by aCGH in 38 MPNSTs were validated at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels on these same tumors and an independent set of 87 MPNST specimens. Results: aCGH revealed highly complex copy number alterations, including both previously reported and completely novel loci. Four regions of copy number gain were associated with poor patient survival. Candidate genes in these regions include SOX5 (12p12.1), NOL1 and MLF2 (12p13.31), FOXM1 and FKBP1 (12p13.33), and CDK4 and TSPAN31 (12q14.1). Alterations of these candidate genes and several others of interest (ERBB2, MYC and TP53) were confirmed by at least 1 complementary methodology, including DNA and mRNA quantitative real-time PCR, mRNA expression profiling, and tissue microarraybased fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Multivariate analysis showed that CDK4 gain/amplification and increased FOXM1 protein expression were the most significant independent predictors for poor survival in MPNST patients (P < 0.05).

Here, MET function and blockade were preclinically assessed. Experimental Design: Expression levels of MET, its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and phosphorylated MET (pMET) were examined in a clinically annotated MPNST tissue microarray (TMA) incorporating univariable and multivariable statistical analyses. Human MPNST cells were studied in vitro and in vivo; Western blot (WB) and ELISA were used to evaluate MET and HGF expression, activation, and downstream signaling. Cell culture assays tested the impact of HGF-induced MET activation and anti-MET–specific siRNA inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; in vivo gel-foam assays were used to evaluate angiogenesis. Cells stably transduced with anti-MET short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were tested for growth and metastasis in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor XL184 (Exelixis) targeting MET/VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) on local and metastatic MPNST growth was examined in vivo. Results: All three markers were expressed in MPNST human samples; pMET expression was an independent prognosticator of poor patient outcome. Human MPNST cell lines expressed MET, HGF, and pMET. MET activation increased MPNST cell motility, invasion, angiogenesis, and induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and VEGF expression; MET knockdown had inverse effects in vitro and markedly decreased local and metastatic growth in vivo. XL184 abrogated human MPNST xenograft growth and metastasis in SCID mice. Conclusions: Informative prognosticators and novel therapies are crucially needed to improve MPNST management and outcomes.

Significant morbidity can result from surgical treatment of these tumors. Meningiomas, ependymomas, and other benign central nervous system tumors are also common in NF2. The lack of effective treatments for NF2 marks an unmet medical need. Experimental Design: Here, we provide recommendations from a workshop, cochaired by Drs. D. Gareth Evans and Marco Giovannini, of 36 international researchers, physicians, representatives of the biotechnology industry, and patient advocates on how to accelerate progress toward NF2 clinical trials. Results: Workshop participants reached a consensus that, based on current knowledge, the time is right to plan and implement NF2 clinical trials. Obstacles impeding NF2 clinical trials and how to address them were discussed, as well as the candidate therapeutic pipeline for NF2. Conclusions: Both phase 0 and phase II NF2 trials are near-term options for NF2 clinical trials. The number of NF2 patients in the population remains limited, and successful recruitment will require ongoing collaboration efforts between NF2 clinics.

The chaperone protein HSP90 is essential for the stabilization of these signaling molecules. The aim of the study was to characterize the effect of HSP90 inhibition in various NF2-deﬁcient models. Experimental Design: We tested efﬁcacy of the small-molecule NXD30001, which has been shown to be a potent HSP90 inhibitor. The antiproliferative activity of NXD30001 was tested in NF2-deﬁcient cell lines and in human primary schwannoma and meningioma cultures in vitro. The antitumor efﬁcacy of HSP90 inhibition in vivo was veriﬁed in two allograft models and in one NF2 transgenic model. The underlying molecular alteration was further characterized by a global transcriptome approach. Results: NXD30001 induced degradation of client proteins in and suppressed proliferation of NF2deﬁcient cells. Differential expression analysis identiﬁed subsets of genes implicated in cell proliferation, cell survival, vascularization, and Schwann cell differentiation whose expression was altered by NXD30001 treatment. The results showed that NXD30001 in NF2-deﬁcient schwannoma suppressed multiple pathways necessary for tumorigenesis.

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) that are resistant to therapies. Experimental Design: The aim of this study was to identify an additional pathway in the NF1 tumorigenesis. We focused our work on Wnt signaling that is highly implicated in cancer, mainly in regulating the proliferation of cancer stem cells. We quantiﬁed mRNAs of 89 Wnt pathway genes in 57 NF1associated tumors including dermal and plexiform neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs. Expression of two major stem cell marker genes and ﬁve major epithelial–mesenchymal transition marker genes was also assessed. The expression of signiﬁcantly deregulated Wnt genes was then studied in normal human Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, and mast cells and in seven MPNST cell lines. Results: The expression of nine Wnt genes was signiﬁcantly deregulated in plexiform neuroﬁbromas in comparison with dermal neuroﬁbromas. Twenty Wnt genes showed altered expression in MPNST biopsies and cell lines. Immunohistochemical studies conﬁrmed the Wnt pathway activation in NF1-associated MPNSTs. We then conﬁrmed that the knockdown of NF1 in Schwann cells but not in epithelial cells provoked the activation of Wnt pathway by functional transfection assays. Furthermore, we showed that the protein expression of active b-catenin was increased in NF1-silenced cell lines. Wnt pathway activation was strongly associated to both cancer stem cell reservoir and Schwann–mesenchymal transition. Conclusion: We highlighted the implication of Wnt pathway in NF1-associated tumorigenesis. Clin Cancer Res; 20(2); 358–71. Ó2013 AACR."DA58D4XW,2013,"Lin, J.; Sampath, D.; Nannini, M. A.; Lee, B.

Experimental Design: The effect of GDC-0068 on Akt signaling was characterized using speciﬁc biomarkers of the Akt pathway, and response to GDC-0068 was evaluated in human cancer cell lines and xenograft models with various genetic backgrounds, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Results: GDC-0068 blocked Akt signaling both in cultured human cancer cell lines and in tumor xenograft models as evidenced by dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of downstream targets. Inhibition of Akt activity by GDC-0068 resulted in blockade of cell-cycle progression and reduced viability of cancer cell lines. Markers of Akt activation, including high-basal phospho-Akt levels, PTEN loss, and PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, correlate with sensitivity to GDC-0068. Isogenic PTEN knockout also sensitized MCF10A cells to GDC-0068. In multiple tumor xenograft models, oral administration of GDC0068 resulted in antitumor activity ranging from tumor growth delay to regression. Consistent with the role of Akt in a survival pathway, GDC-0068 also enhanced antitumor activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusions: GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally bioavailable Akt kinase inhibitor that shows pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

We employed a pooled RNA interference screen targeting >16,500 genes to discover loss of function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition.

NF1 mutations were observed in B-RAF-mutant tumor cells that are intrinsically resistant to RAF inhibition and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus demonstrating the clinical potential for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEKtargeted therapies."FBB27ZYZ,2013,"Oliveira, Ana F.; Yasuda, Ryohei",An Improved Ras Sensor for Highly Sensitive and Quantitative FRET-FLIM Imaging,10.1371/journal.pone.0052874,http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052874,1/14/2013,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\F9F64KQC\Oliveira and Yasuda - 2013 - An Improved Ras Sensor for Highly Sensitive and Qu.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1371_journal.pone.0052874.pdf,10.1371_journal.pone.0052874.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1371_journal.pone.0052874.txt,10.1371_journal.pone.0052874.txt,"Ras is a signaling protein involved in a variety of cellular processes.

SB mutagenesis has already identified a large collection of known cancer genes in addition to a plethora of new candidate cancer genes and potential drug targets."TY3V8J7F,2006,"Collado, Manuel; Serrano, Manuel",The power and the promise of oncogene-induced senescence markers,10.1038/nrc1884,http://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1884,2006-06,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\EYE8UE7W\Collado and Serrano - 2006 - The power and the promise of oncogene-induced sene.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1038_nrc1884.pdf,10.1038_nrc1884.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1038_nrc1884.txt,10.1038_nrc1884.txt,"Recently, it has been shown that oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) occurs during the early stages of tumorigenesis.

We evaluated the growth and body mass characteristics of 28 individuals with 16p11.2 (chr16:29.5 Mbe30.1 Mb) deletion originally ascertained for their developmental disorders by reviewing their medical records.

Thirteen out of the 18 deletion carriers aged 5 years and older (72%) were overweight or obese, whereas only two of 10 deletion carriers (20%) younger than ﬁve were overweight or obese.

The substrate specificity and (sub)cellular localization of the PP2A holoenzymes are highly regulated by interaction with a family of regulatory B subunits (PP2A-Bs). The regulatory subunit PP2A-B/PR55d (PP2A-Bd) is involving in the dephosphorylation of PP2A substrates and is crucial for controlling entry into and exit from mitosis. The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of PP2A-Bd gene (PPP2R2D) remain largely unknown. To explore genetic variations in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D gene as well as their frequent haplotypes in the Han Chinese population and determine whether such variations have an impact on transcriptional activity, DNA samples were collected from 70 healthy Chinese donors and sequenced for identifying genetic variants in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D. Four genetic variants were identified in the 1836 bp 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype profiles were constructed for the genetic variants. Using serially truncated human PPP2R2D promoter luciferase constructs, we found that a 601 bp (2540 nt to +61 nt) fragment constitutes the core promoter region. The subcloning of individual 59-flanking fragment revealed the existence of three haplotypes in the distal promoter of PPP2R2D. The luciferase reporter assay showed that different haplotypes exhibited distinct promoter activities. The EMSA revealed that the 2462 G.A variant influences DNA-protein interactions involving the nuclear factor 1 (NF1). In vitro reporter gene assay indicated that cotransfection of NF1/B expression plasmid could positively regulate the activity of PPP2R2D proximal promoter. Introduction of exogenous NF1/B expression plasmid further confirmed that the NF1 involves in the regulation of PPP2R2D gene expression. Our findings suggest that functional genetic variants and their haplotypes in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D are critical for transcriptional regulation of PP2A-Bd."WVH5BUG8,2012,"Bashashati, Ali; Haffari, Gholamreza; Ding, Jiarui; Ha, Gavin; Lui, Kenneth; Rosner, Jamie; Huntsman, David G; Caldas, Carlos; Aparicio, Samuel A; Shah, Sohrab P",DriverNet: uncovering the impact of somatic driver mutations on transcriptional networks in cancer,10.1186/gb-2012-13-12-r124,http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-12-r124,2012,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\THKF55EL\Bashashati et al. - 2012 - DriverNet uncovering the impact of somatic driver.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1186_gb-2012-13-12-r124.pdf,10.1186_gb-2012-13-12-r124.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1186_gb-2012-13-12-r124.txt,10.1186_gb-2012-13-12-r124.txt,"Simultaneous interrogation of tumor genomes and transcriptomes is underway in unprecedented global efforts.

There is increasing evidence that many cancers initiate through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple neurofibromas, complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann cell lineage following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the microenvironment and additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify whether a temporal ""window of opportunity"" exists during which cells of the Schwann cell lineage can give rise to neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann cells can lead to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis. This model has important implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate neurofibroma development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these tumors.

Retrospective study comparing ScoliScore and clinical risk estimates. Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare risk stratiﬁcation between ScoliScore and traditional clinical estimates to determine whether ScoliScore provides unique information. Summary of Background Data. ScoliScore is a genetic prognostic test designed to evaluate the risk of curve progression in skeletally immature patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with Cobb angles of 10° to 25°. Clinicians are currently trying to better understand the role this test may play in guiding clinical decision making because current standards of curve progression are largely based on radiographical markers, such as curve magnitude and bone age. ScoliScore (r = 0.581, P ? 0.001). Cobb angle remained signiﬁcant in the multivariate regression model (P ? 0.001), and Cobb angle was found to account for 33.3% of ScoliScore’s variance. Conclusion. Only Cobb angle showed signiﬁcant correlation with ScoliScore among the socioclinical variables studied. The risk distribution of the 2 risk estimation systems examined differed markedly: ScoliScore predicted nearly 16 times more low-risk patients and more than 5 times fewer high-risk patients. This demonstrates that ScoliScore provides unique information to traditional predictors of curve progression, advancing our understanding of the role of ScoliScore in the clinical setting."ARJW7BER,2012,"Kalamarides, Michel; Acosta, Maria T.; Babovic-Vuksanovic, Dusica; Carpen, Olli; Cichowski, Karen; Gareth Evans, D.; Giancotti, Filippo; Oliver Hanemann, C.; Ingram, David; Lloyd, Alison C.; Mayes, Debra A.; Messiaen, Ludwine; Morrison, Helen; North, Kathryn; Packer, Roger; Pan, Duojia; Stemmer-Rachamimov, Anat; Upadhyaya, Meena; Viskochil, David; Wallace, Margret R.; Hunter-Schaedle, Kim; Ratner, Nancy",Neurofibromatosis 2011: a report of the Children’s Tumor Foundation Annual Meeting,10.1007/s00401-011-0905-0,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00401-011-0905-0,2012-03,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\SBXWRV4I\Kalamarides et al. - 2012 - Neurofibromatosis 2011 a report of the Children’s.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1007_s00401-011-0905-0.pdf,10.1007_s00401-011-0905-0.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1007_s00401-011-0905-0.txt,10.1007_s00401-011-0905-0.txt,"The 2011 annual meeting of the Children’s Tumor Foundation, the annual gathering of the neuroﬁbromatosis (NF) research and clinical communities, was attended by 330 participants who discussed integration of new signaling pathways into NF research, the appreciation for NF mutations in sporadic cancers, and an expanding pre-clinical and clinical agenda.

We have developed and validated two methods for simple enrichment and isolation of single or multiplex gene KO’s in transformed, immortalized, and human progenitor cells. These methods rely on selection of a phenotypic change such as resistance to a particular drug or ability to grow in a selective environment. The first method, termed co-transposition, utilizes integration of a piggyBac transposon vector encoding a drug resistance gene. The second method, termed cotargeting, utilizes TALENs to KO any gene that when lost induces a selectable phenotype. Using these methods we also show removal of entire genes and demonstrate that TALENs function in human CD34+ progenitor cells. Further, cotransposition can be used to generate conditional KO cell lines utilizing an inducible cDNA rescue transposon vector.

Withdrawal from the cell cycle, around postnatal days 2-4 in rodents, initiates terminal differentiation to the myelinating state. During this time, Schwann cell number is subject to stringent regulation such that within the first postnatal week, axons and myelinating Schwann cells attain the one-to-one relationship characteristic of the mature nerve. The mechanisms that underly this developmental control remain largely undefined. In this report, we examine the role of apoptosis in the determination of postnatal Schwann cell number. We find that Schwann cells isolated from postnatal day 3 rat sciatic nerve undergo apoptosis in vitro upon serum withdrawal and that Schwann cell death can be prevented by fg forms of neuregulin (NRG-f3) but not by fibroblast growth factor 2 or platelet-derived growth factors AA and BB. This NRG-,8mediated Schwann cell survival is apparently transduced through an ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor heterodimer.

Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be the primary pathogenic cell in neuroﬁbromas because they harbor biallelic neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1) gene mutations. However, the phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (Nf1) genes recently were found to be comutated in high-grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) in mice. In this study, we created transgenic mice that lack both Pten and Nf1 in Schwann cells and Schwann cell precursor cells to validate the role of these two genes in PNST formation in vivo. Haploinsufﬁciency or complete loss of Pten dramatically accelerated neuroﬁbroma development and led to the development of higher grade PNSTs in the context of Nf1 loss. Pten dosage, together with Nf1 loss, was sufﬁcient for the progression from low-grade to high-grade PNSTs.

Mouse isolated sensory neurons in culture and freshly dissociated spinal cord slices were used to examine the enhancement in stimulated-release of the neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), as a measure of sensitization. Exposure of isolated sensory neurons in culture to GDNF, neurturin, and artemin enhanced the capsaicin-stimulated release of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide (iCGRP) two- to threefold, but did not increase potassium-stimulated release of iCGRP. A similar proﬁle of sensitization was observed in freshly dissociated spinal cord slices. Persephin, another member of the GFL family thought to be important in development, was unable to induce an enhancement in the release of iCGRP. These results demonstrate that speciﬁc GFLs are important mediators affecting sensory neuronal sensitivity, likely through modulation of the capsaicin receptor. The sensitization of sensory neurons during inﬂammation, and the pain and neurogenic inﬂammation resulting from this sensitization, may be due in part to the effects of these selected GFLs. © 2009 IBRO.

Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3 NF conditions.

Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct subcellular localizations when expressed in the polarized imaginal epithelium, and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the NF2 protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele, NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive. These studies highlight the utility of Drosophila for in vivo functional analysis of highly conserved human disease genes."WUNGF5RS,2009,"Tidyman, William E; Rauen, Katherine A",The RASopathies: developmental syndromes of Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation,10.1016/j.gde.2009.04.001,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959437X09000707,2009-06,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\YI95GMDP\Tidyman and Rauen - 2009 - The RASopathies developmental syndromes of RasMA.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.gde.2009.04.001.pdf,10.1016_j.gde.2009.04.001.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.gde.2009.04.001.txt,10.1016_j.gde.2009.04.001.txt,"The Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is essential in the regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, growth and cell senescence, all of which are critical to normal development.

A class of developmental disorders, the “RASopathies”, is caused by germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. The vast majority of these mutations result in increased signal transduction down the Ras/MAPK pathway, but usually to a lesser extent than somatic mutations associated with oncogenesis. Each syndrome exhibits unique phenotypic features, however, since they all cause dysregulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, there are numerous overlapping phenotypic features between the syndromes, including characteristic facial features, cardiac defects, cutaneous abnormalities, neurocognitive delay and a predisposition to malignancies. Here we review the clinical and underlying molecular basis for each of these syndromes."8MF28FT3,2012,"Hatzivassiliou, G.; Liu, B.; O'Brien, C.; Spoerke, J. M.; Hoeflich, K. P.; Haverty, P.

Several allosteric mitogen-activated protein/ extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, aimed at treating tumors with RAS/RAF pathway alterations, are in clinical development. However, acquired resistance to these inhibitors has been documented both in preclinical and clinical samples. To identify strategies to overcome this resistance, we have derived three independent MEK inhibitor–resistant cell lines. Resistance to allosteric MEK inhibitors in these cell lines was consistently linked to acquired mutations in the allosteric binding pocket of MEK. In one cell line, concurrent ampliﬁcation of mutant K-ras was observed in conjunction with MEK allosteric pocket mutations. Clonal analysis showed that both resistance mechanisms occur in the same cell and contribute to enhanced resistance. Importantly, in all cases the MEK-resistant cell lines retained their addiction to the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as evidenced by their sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of the ERK1/2 kinases. These data suggest that tumors with acquired MEK inhibitor resistance remain dependent on the MAPK pathway and are therefore sensitive to inhibitors that act downstream of the mutated MEK target. Importantly, we show that dual inhibition of MEK and ERK by small molecule inhibitors was synergistic and acted to both inhibit the emergence of resistance, as well as to overcome acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors. Therefore, our data provide a rationale for cotargeting multiple nodes within the MAPK signaling cascade in K-ras mutant tumors to maximize therapeutic beneﬁt for patients.

Cabozantinib (XL184) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including RET, KIT, AXL, and FLT3. Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to signiﬁcant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. In mouse models, cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. Importantly, treatment with cabozantinib did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of VEGF signaling that do not target MET.

PR binding was correlated with transcriptional outcome in both cell lines, with 60% of progestin-regulated genes associated with one or more PR binding regions. There was a remarkably low overlap between the PR cistromes of the two cell lines, and a similarly low overlap in transcriptional targets. A conserved PR binding element was identified in PR binding regions from both cell lines, but there were distinct patterns of enrichment of known cofactor binding motifs, with FOXA1 sites over-represented in breast cancer cell binding regions and NF1 and AP-1 motifs uniquely enriched in the immortalized normal line.

The hybrid coupling method is adopted in coupled RMC/CTF code, in which CTF is invoked by RMC ﬂexibly. For code versatility and stabilization, the HDF5 (hierarchical data format) ﬁle is used to replace text ﬁles in data transfer between two coupled codes, and the predictor-corrector method is also proposed to stabilize the coupling. The coupled code is validated as versatile by successfully testing two full-core problems with di?erent scales. The BEAVRS full core calculation results show the e?ciency improvement as a result of using the HDF5 ﬁle in the versatile coupled code, and the predictor-corrector method used in the simulation is demonstrated to be e?ective for stabilizing and accelerating the coupling convergence.

By living inside the maternal compartment, the fetus is inevitably exposed to rhythms of the maternal internal milieu such as temperature; rhythms originated by maternal food intake and maternal melatonin, one of the few maternal hormones that cross the placenta unaltered. The fetus, immature by adult standards, is however perfectly ﬁt to accomplish the dual functions of living in the uterine environment and developing the necessary tools to ‘‘mature’’ for the next step, i.e. to be a competent newborn. In the fetal physiological context, organ function differs from the same organ’s function in the newborn and adult. This may also extend to the developing circadian system. The information reviewed here suggests that the fetal circadian system is organized differently from that of the adult. Moreover, the fetal circadian rhythm is not just present simply as the initial immature expression of a mechanism that has function in the postnatal animal only. We propose that the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and fetal organs are peripheral maternal circadian oscillators, entrained by different maternal signals. Conceptually, the arrangement produces internal temporal order during fetal life, inside the maternal compartment. Following birth, it will allow for postnatal integration of the scattered fetal circadian clocks into an adult-like circadian system commanded by the SCN."V9JXB9JB,2011,"Nardella, Caterina; Lunardi, Andrea; Patnaik, Akash; Cantley, Lewis C.; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo",The APL Paradigm and the “Co-Clinical Trial” Project,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0061,http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0061,2011-07,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\HF3X6N66\Nardella et al. - 2011 - The APL Paradigm and the “Co-Clinical Trial” Proje.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1158_2159-8290.CD-11-0061.pdf,10.1158_2159-8290.CD-11-0061.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1158_2159-8290.CD-11-0061.txt,10.1158_2159-8290.CD-11-0061.txt,"Tremendous advances in technologies have allowed the attainment of powerful insights into the molecular and genetic determinants that drive human cancers.

MEK inhibitors relieve ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF and cause induction of MEK phosphorylation. We have now identiﬁed a MEK inhibitor, CH5126766 (RO5126766), that has the unique property of inhibiting RAF kinase as well. CH5126766 binding causes MEK to adopt a conformation in which it cannot be phosphorylated by and released from RAF. This results in formation of a stable MEK/RAF complex and inhibition of RAF kinase. Consistent with this mechanism, this drug does not induce MEK phosphorylation. CH5126766 inhibits ERK signaling output more effectively than a standard MEK inhibitor that induces MEK phosphorylation and has potent antitumor activity as well. These results suggest that relief of RAF feedback limits pathway inhibition by standard MEK inhibitors.

The classification of neurological tumours is based on their predominant cell type(s) as they relate to normal cell types that are present in the CNS and PNS. • Glial cells retain proliferative properties throughout life. So, most neurological tumours are of glial-lineage origin. In the CNS, gliomas include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. In the PNS, neurofibromas and schwannomas are common tumours. • Genetic pathways that are involved in the initiation and progression of astrocytomas have been identified. In secondary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), loss of p53 and activation of the growth-factor–receptor-tyrosine-kinase signalling pathway initiates tumour formation, whereas disruption of the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway contributes to the progression of tumour development. • Similar genetic pathways are disrupted in primary GBM, although through different mechanisms. The rapid growth nature of the primary GBM indicates that this type of malignancy might arise from the transformation of adult neural stem cells, which either are present in the brain or can be de-differentiated from astrocytes in response to oncogenic mutations. • Dermal neurofibromas are thought to be derived from a component of mature Schwann cells, whereas plexiform neurofibromas are believed to arise from an embryonic Schwann-cell lineage. Most malignant peripheral-nerve-sheath tumours are derived from neurofibromas — particularly plexiform neurofibromas. • Disruption of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in the Schwann-cell lineage initiates neurofibroma formation. In the setting of plexiform neurofibroma, the heterozygous state of tumour environment is important for tumour formation. The disruption of the p53 pathway is involved in the malignant progression of neurofibroma."PTY8TG7D,2012,"Roehl, Angelika C.; Mussotter, Tanja; Cooper, David N.; Kluwe, Lan; Wimmer, Katharina; Högel, Josef; Zetzmann, Marion; Vogt, Julia; Mautner, Victor-Felix; Kehrer-Sawatzki, Hildegard",Tissue-specific differences in the proportion of mosaic large NF1 deletions are suggestive of a selective growth advantage of hematopoietic del(+/?) stem cells,10.1002/humu.22013,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/humu.22013,2012-03,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\ZWLZ2BM9\Roehl et al. - 2012 - Tissue-specific differences in the proportion of m.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\H6UN4EIR\Roehl et al. - 2012 - Tissue-specific differences in the proportion of m.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1002_humu.22013.pdf,10.1002_humu.22013.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1002_humu.22013.txt,10.1002_humu.22013.txt,"Type-2 NF1 deletions spanning 1.2 Mb are frequently of postzygotic origin and hence tend to be associated with mosaicism for normal cells and those harboring the deletion (del(+/?) cells).

Both endogenous DRNDA activity and optogenetically driven DRNDA activity were associated with waking from sleep, with DA signal strength predictive of wake duration. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition opposed wakefulness and promoted NREM sleep, even in the face of salient stimuli.

At least 1 hybrid tumor occurred in 10 of 14 (71%) schwannomatosis patients. We then retrieved cases of hybrid tumors without documented relation to schwannomatosis from our database and identiﬁed 41 tumors arising in 23 patients. More than half of these patients (14/23) were reported to su?er from multiple peripheral nerve sheath tumors, favoring a tumor syndrome. Indeed, analysis of clinical records revealed the diagnosis of neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) in 26% (6/23), neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) in 9% (2/23), deﬁnite schwannomatosis in 4% (1/23), and possible schwannomatosis in 13% (3/23) of patients with multiple nerve sheath tumors. Our ﬁndings suggest that hybrid neuroﬁbroma/schwannoma represents a common tumor type in schwannomatosis and shows a striking association with neuroﬁbromatoses."85Z6TZCX,2014,"Smith, Miriam J; Wallace, Andrew J; Bennett, Chris; Hasselblatt, Martin; Elert-Dobkowska, Ewelina; Evans, Linton T; Hickey, William F; van Hoff, Jack; Bauer, David; Lee, Amy; Hevner, Robert F; Beetz, Christian; du Plessis, Daniel; Kilday, John-Paul; Newman, William G; Evans, D Gareth",Germline <i>SMARCE1</i> mutations predispose to both spinal and cranial clear cell meningiomas,10.1002/path.4427,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/path.4427,2014-12,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\VT8UC5N2\Smith et al. - 2014 - Germline iSMARCE1i mutations predispose to bo.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\ZP99LJUI\Smith et al. - 2014 - Germline iSMARCE1i mutations predispose to bo.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1002_path.4427.pdf,10.1002_path.4427.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1002_path.4427.txt,10.1002_path.4427.txt,"We recently reported SMARCE1 mutations as a cause of spinal clear cell meningiomas.

We screened them for SMARCE1 mutations and investigated copy number changes in all point mutation-negative samples. We identified two novel mutations in individuals with spinal clear cell meningiomas and three mutations in individuals with cranial clear cell meningiomas. Copy number analysis identified a large deletion of the 5? end of SMARCE1 in two unrelated probands with spinal clear cell meningiomas. Testing of affected and unaffected relatives of one of these individuals identified the same deletion in two affected female siblings and their unaffected father, providing further evidence of incomplete penetrance of meningioma disease in males. In addition, we found loss of SMARCE1 protein in three of 10 paraffin-embedded cranial clear cell meningiomas. Together, these results demonstrate that loss of SMARCE1 is relevant to cranial as well as spinal meningiomas. Our study broadens the spectrum of mutations in the SMARCE1 gene and expands the phenotype to include cranial clear cell meningiomas."I9U5DM96,2008,"Cui, Yijun; Costa, Rui M.; Murphy, Geoffrey G.; Elgersma, Ype; Zhu, Yuan; Gutmann, David H.; Parada, Luis F.; Mody, Istvan; Silva, Alcino J.",Neurofibromin Regulation of ERK Signaling Modulates GABA Release and Learning,10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.060,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867408012968,2008-10,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\S7V7W7XP\Cui et al. - 2008 - Neurofibromin Regulation of ERK Signaling Modulate.pdf; C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\KUS3TTXT\Cui et al. - 2008 - Neurofibromin Regulation of ERK Signaling Modulate.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_j.cell.2008.09.060.pdf,10.1016_j.cell.2008.09.060.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_j.cell.2008.09.060.txt,10.1016_j.cell.2008.09.060.txt,"We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the learning deﬁcits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neuroﬁbromin modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the learning deﬁcits associated with the Nf1 mutation were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABAA antagonist. Accordingly, Cre deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning, indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for learning."FIMGL57W,2011,"Simmons, Grant W.; Pong, Winnie W.; Emnett, Ryan J.; White, Crystal R.; Gianino, Scott M.; Rodriguez, Fausto J.; Gutmann, David H.",Neurofibromatosis-1 Heterozygosity Increases Microglia in a Spatially and Temporally Restricted Pattern Relevant to Mouse Optic Glioma Formation and Growth,10.1097/NEN.0b013e3182032d37,https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-lookup/doi/10.1097/NEN.0b013e3182032d37,2011-01,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\XPWH69FH\Simmons et al. - 2011 - Neurofibromatosis-1 Heterozygosity Increases Micro.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1097_NEN.0b013e3182032d37.pdf,10.1097_NEN.0b013e3182032d37.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1097_NEN.0b013e3182032d37.txt,10.1097_NEN.0b013e3182032d37.txt,"Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver mutations in progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily inﬂuenced by the local microenvironment. Previous studies from our laboratory have used Neuroﬁbromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously, we have shown that Nf1+/j microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To deﬁne the role of microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be ablated at speciﬁc times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor maintenance and tumor development. We identiﬁed the developmental window during which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/j optic nerve and demonstrated that this accumulation reﬂected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in microglia in the Nf1+/j optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma."8Z5UV734,2013,"Addie, Matt; Ballard, Peter; Buttar, David; Crafter, Claire; Currie, Gordon; Davies, Barry R.; Debreczeni, Judit; Dry, Hannah; Dudley, Philippa; Greenwood, Ryan; Johnson, Paul D.; Kettle, Jason G.; Lane, Clare; Lamont, Gillian; Leach, Andrew; Luke, Richard W.

Thirty patients and 30 caregivers completed a 24-item survey about ISGs. Many patients and parents are not aware of any ISGs for NF1, but are interested in using one in the future for a variety of reasons, including to get answers to their questions about NF1, to find out about research studies, and to discuss problems and concerns about NF1. Specific concerns of interest include physical, social-emotional, and cognitive aspects of NF1. ISGs have potential as a social support intervention within the NF1 community. ISGs for the NF1 population should include patients with NF1 (or parents of children with NF1) as well as a health professional, and both chat rooms and discussion boards likely would be well-received.",1989,"Paull, K.D.; Shoemaker, R.H.; Hodes L.; Monks A.; Scudiero, D.A.; Rubinstein, L.; Plowman, J.; Boyd, M.R.",Display and Analysis of Patterns of Differential Activity of Drugs Against Human Tumor Cell Lines: Development of Mean Graph and COMPARE Algorithm,10.1093/jnci/81.14.1088,,,Paull_JNCI-1989-81-1088_Displayandanalysis.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1093_jnci_81.14.1088.pdf,10.1093_jnci_81.14.1088.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1093_jnci_81.14.1088.txt,10.1093_jnci_81.14.1088.txt,J7YRS4UU,1991,"Bothwell, M",Neuronal Growth Factors,10.1007/978-3-642-75747-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-75747-1,1991,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\FWKBUGNH\Bothwell - 1991 - Neuronal Growth Factors.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1007_978-3-642-75747-1.pdf,10.1007_978-3-642-75747-1.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1007_978-3-642-75747-1.txt,10.1007_978-3-642-75747-1.txt,V58FAWVH,1998,"LaJeunesse, Dennis R.; McCartney, Brooke M.; Fehon, Richard G.",Structural Analysis of <i>Drosophila</i> Merlin Reveals Functional Domains Important for Growth Control and Subcellular Localization,10.1083/jcb.141.7.1589,http://www.jcb.org/lookup/doi/10.1083/jcb.141.7.1589,6/29/1998,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\2KVD4C8G\LaJeunesse et al. - 1998 - Structural Analysis of iDrosophilai Merlin Re.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1083_jcb.141.7.1589.pdf,10.1083_jcb.141.7.1589.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1083_jcb.141.7.1589.txt,10.1083_jcb.141.7.1589.txt,MGFHQAY6,1998,"Scheffzek, Klaus; Ahmadian, Mohammad Reza; Wittinghofer, Alfred",GTPase-activating proteins: helping hands to complement an active site,10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01224-9,http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968000498012249,1998-07,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\AY49F96I\Scheffzek et al. - 1998 - GTPase-activating proteins helping hands to compl.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1016_S0968-0004(98)01224-9.pdf,10.1016_S0968-0004(98)01224-9.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1016_S0968-0004(98)01224-9.txt,10.1016_S0968-0004(98)01224-9.txt,NA7XRCFY,1998,"Scheffzek, K.",Structural analysis of the GAP-related domain from neurofibromin and its implications,10.1093/emboj/17.15.4313,http://emboj.embopress.org/cgi/doi/10.1093/emboj/17.15.4313,8/3/1998,C:\Users\cliu\Zotero\storage\FLZU2KGQ\Scheffzek - 1998 - Structural analysis of the GAP-related domain from.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\pdf\10.1093_emboj_17.15.4313.pdf,10.1093_emboj_17.15.4313.pdf,grants-analysis-data\papers\txt\10.1093_emboj_17.15.4313.txt,10.1093_emboj_17.15.4313.txt,CFB2FNAX,1998,"McClatchey, A.
