Despite the identification of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene over a decade ago, the molecular function of its encoded protein, Merlin, remains elusive.  Merlin is a member of the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family of proteins that are thought to link the actin cytoskeleton to various membrane-associated proteins.  Like the ERM proteins, Merlin localizes to the membrane:cytoskeleton interface, forms homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, and shares numerous protein binding partners with the ERMs.  Studies of Nf2-mutant mice have revealed a role for Merlin function in many different cell types and suggest that loss of Merlin contributes to both tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Previous work in our lab demonstrated that Nf2-deficiency in primary cells results in the loss of contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation and defective cell:cell communication.  We discovered that Merlin localizes to adherens junctions (AJs) in wild-type cells and is required for the establishment of stabilized AJs.  Loss of AJs has been linked to tumor development and metastasis in humans and mice. Despite their similarity to Merlin, the ERM proteins are not known to function as tumor suppressors; in fact, several studies suggest the opposite Ð that the ERMs promote cell transformation, survival, motility, and invasiveness.  Indeed, recent studies have linked Ezrin expression to increased tumor metastasis, but its role in this process remains to be elucidated.  Unfortunately, identification of molecular functions unique to any one of the mammalian ERM proteins has been largely impeded by their presumed redundancy.  Among the ERM proteins, however, Ezrin exhibits the most restricted pattern of expression in vivo, and is the only ERM detected in the small intestinal epithelium.  Our studies of Ezrin-mutant embryos and adult mice indicate that Ezrin plays an important role in junctional remodeling during morphogenesis.  Together, our studies of Merlin and Ezrin suggest that they may play opposing roles in junctional remodeling.  The goal of this proposal is to test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo and to determine whether the molecular functions of Merlin and Ezrin in tumorigenesis and metastasis reflect their roles in junctional remodeling.","Mutations in the NF2 gene underlie neurofibromatosis 2, an inherited cancer syndrome that predisposes patients to the formation of schwannomas and meningiomas.

Neurofibromin, encoded by NF1, regulates key intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAS and cAMP pathways. The NF1-associated malignancy is related to loss of GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) function of neurofibromin, resulting in hyper-activation of the RAS signaling pathway. Despite encouraging progress, one striking and troubling feature about NF1 is the wide variability of its clinical phenotypes, underscoring the existence of genetic and/or epigenetic modifiers. To provide better treatments and prognosis for this progressive disorder, it is important to identify those potential modifiers and understand the underlying mechanisms. The Lindquist lab has been studying the roles of heat shock proteins, a group of molecular chaperones to protect cells against various stressful and pathological insults, in human diseases. Our recent data clearly identify heat shock factor 1(Hsf1), the master transcription factor to regulate heat shock proteins expression, as a crucial candidate modifier of the oncogenic process. Loss of Hsf1 gene renders cells and mice remarkably resistant to the oncogenic RAS-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis respectively. A similar pattern is also observed in a mutant Trp53 mouse cancer model and a PDGF-induced cellular transformation assay. Both dysregulated PDGF signaling and TP53 mutations have been implicated in the malignant progression of NF1 neurofibromas. Our data and the literature also indicate that loss of Hsf1 and Nf1 function impose opposing effects on cell cycle progression, ribosomal biogenesis, and translational control that are known to be altered in many human cancers. Moreover, Nf1 deficiency causes over-expression and activation of HSF1. Therefore, I hypothesize that HSF1 is a potent genetic modifier of NF1-associated tumorigenesis. In this proposal, I will characterize the ability of Hsf1 to modify the alterations in susceptibility to transformation, sensitivity to mitogenic stimuli, ribosomal biogenesis, and translational control that are known to be associated with Nf1 deficiency in vitro. Further, I will examine the modifying effects of Hsf1 on NF1-associated tumorigenesis in vivo using the Nf1+/-:Trp53+/- cis mouse model. It is hoped that these studies will provide not only mechanistic insights into how NF1 deficiency interacts with HSF1 and the cellular heat shock response to promote tumorigenesis but also the basis for developing novel HSF1-targeted strategies to limit the oncogenic predisposition associated with loss of NF1 function.","Neurofibromatosis type 1(NF1), a common human cancer-predisposition disorder, is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene.

The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a 250 kD protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling by functioning as a Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP). Consequently, cells deficient for NF1 exhibit a relative increase in levels of active Ras (GTP-bound) and display increased activation of Ras effector pathways, including AKT and Erk. However, the specific pathways downstream of Ras that are responsible for NF1 -dependent tumorigenicity remain unclear. Recently, we have shown that neurofibromin regulates the TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway in a Ras-dependent manner. TOR activation is sensitive to both PI3K inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. Importantly, we have also shown that mTOR inhibitors specifically inhibit the growth and tumorigenic properties of NF1 -deficient cells, implying that activation of the mTOR pathway is a critical step in NF1 -dependent tumorigenesis. Aim 1 proposes to test the efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in preventing tumor growth and/or causing tumor regression in mouse models of NF1 -dependent tumors.

In the absence of Schwann cells, nerves are vulnerable to degeneration and death, but over proliferation of these cells leads to peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs), including both neurofibromas and schwannomas.  PNSTs can cause severe morbidity in affected patients, and although these tumors are typically benign, some will transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which are very aggressive and highly lethal.  Several human diseases are associated with the formation of PNSTs, namely the Neurofibromatosis (NF) syndromes, Carney Complex (CNC), and familial schwannomatosis.  Cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas are characteristic in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), whereas vestibular schwannoma and psammomatous melanotic schwannoma are common in NF2 and CNC, respectively.  Patients affected with schwannomatosis are at risk for schwannoma development throughout the body. With the exception of schwannomatosis, the genes responsible for these diseases have been identified.  NF1 is caused by mutations in neurofibromin, a large protein thought to function as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) with a role in regulating Ras signaling.  NF2 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding merlin (or schwannomin), a protein involved in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane.  CNC may be caused by inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A, one of the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Protein Kinase A (PKA).  To study the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis caused by mutation in PRKAR1A, our lab has generated conditional and conventional knockouts of the gene Prkar1a in the murine system.  Whereas homozygous deletion of Prkar1a is embryonically lethal, heterozygotes are prone to tumor formation, and approximately 33% of adult mice develop schwannomas.  We have also shown that tissue specific deletion of Prkar1a from a subset of facial neural crest cells leads to almost completely penetrant PNST formation by 6 months of age.   In this proposal, we aim to continue our studies into the molecular mechanisms of schwannoma formation caused by loss of Prkar1a .  Specifically, we intend to perform molecular characterization of Prkar1a KO PNSTs to examine the signaling pathways affected by loss of this gene, and relate those findings to PNSTs from NF models.  Additionally, we plan to utilise Prkar1a KO Schwann cells in vitro to probe the molecular interactions of the PKA signaling cascade with the NF proteins neurofibromin and merlin.  Overall, we anticipate that these studies will enhance our understanding of the molecular biology of schwannomas, and potentially suggest new ways in which manipulation of the PKA signaling pathway might be used to aid in the management of these tumors.","Schwann cells primarily function to myelinate and support nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system.

NF1 is frequently inactivated in neural crest-derived tumors. In addition, predisposition of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) uncovered a critical role of NF1 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Thus, NF1 inactivation, like other genetic mutations that hyperactive Ras (N- and K-RAS point mutations, BCR-ABL fusion, and PTPN11 mutations), may underlie leukemic and preleukemic diseases, such as myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatments for most patients with NF1 and NF1 associated leukemias are unsatisfactory due to poor efficacy, high incidence of toxicity, or both. Despite continued efforts limited progress has been made toward developing effective and safe therapeutic agents for NF1-related diseases. A major reason for this is that drug discovery is ultimately a biochemical problem that requires a greater understanding of the signaling pathway alterations underlying the disease. Another limitation has been the failure of immortalized cell lines to accurately mimic the behavior of deregulated signaling networks found in primary cancer cells. The precedent of imatinab in CML demonstrates the great potential of developing therapeutics to specific molecular lesions that deregulate signal transduction pathways.

NF1 is the most common of all inherited diseases that exhibits a dominant inheritance pattern resulting from mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) gene. Nf1 is a tumor suppressor whose cellular functions remain relatively unknown except for its activity as a GTPase activating protein (GAP), however, current evidence suggests that additional unidentified functions and modifiers of this protein contribute to the complex molecular etiology of this disease. While mouse models of NF1 and cell culture studies are responsible for our current understanding of NF1, the development of a zebrafish Nf1 model offers many unique advantages including in vivo analysis and forward genetic and small molecule screening capacities, which holds enormous potential for identifying novel modifiers of human disease pathways. The proven conservation of molecular pathways controlling neural development and tumorigenesis in zebrafish and man suggest that a zebrafish Nf1 model will be very relevant to human NF1. I will generate zebrafish models for NF1 by 1) transiently knocking down Nf1 using anti-sense Nf1 morpholinos and 2) establishing stable lines harboring Nf1 loss-of-function mutations identified through a reverse-genetic technique called TILLING. My preliminary studies indicate that the transient loss of Nf1 during embryonic development mimics the loss of function phenotypes in other species including humans and mice. The transient or stable knockdown of Nf1 function in zebrafish will allow an unprecedented ability to analyze the role of Nf1 and the requirement of its GAP activity in vivo. Importantly, by exploiting the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish Nf1 model I propose to perform a dominant modifier screen to identify potentially novel genes and pathways that either enhance or suppress the Nf1 phenotype. These studies will have enormous implications for furthering our understanding of human NF1 regulation as well as contributing to the design of new drug targets for improving clinical therapies.","Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) affects both children and adults, predisposing them to develop benign as well as malignant tumors of neural crest origin.

In addition, CSCs from these glial tumors when implanted into rodent brains generate tumors histologically identical to the parental tumors, suggesting that these stem cells can fully recapitulate the neoplastic phenotype in vivo. While these seminal studies clearly highlight the central role of stem cells in brain tumor formation, they also evoke important questions regarding the nature of the CSC and its relationship to the normal NSC.

People with NF1 can experience hyperalgesia, increased pain in response to noxious stimuli. Since this pain is often a result of injury, it is likely of the inflammatory type, which is related to increases in inflammatory mediators. Growth factors are a type of mediator known to incite inflammatory pain, often by means of altering sensory neuron sensitivity. Schwann cells and mast cells produce growth factors, and hypersecretion of certain growth factors has been observed in the Schwann cells of Nf1 mouse models, indicating that there may be an increased concentration of growth factors in the tumor microenvironment. Exposure to nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) could result in hypersensitivity of sensory neurons within and near the neurofibroma, which may be a result of dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways within these neurons. Although NGF is a known sensitizer of sensory neurons, there is increasing evidence to suggest that GDNF family molecules are also mediators of this sensitivity, though little work has been done to elucidate the mechanisms by which this occurs. The signaling transduction pathways activated by these growth factors are dysregulated due to decreased levels of functioning neurofibromin, a guanosine triphosphate activating protein (GAP). GAPs accelerate the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, preventing it from initiating signaling cascades, including the MAPK and PI3-K pathways. When growth factors, such as NGF and GDNF, bind to their receptors, they activate the Ras transduction cascade. NGF is a known sensitizer of sensory neurons that acts via TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), and the GDNF family receptor, Ret, is also a RTK. Therefore, GDNF family molecules and NGF may sensitize sensory neurons via similar mechanisms. Additionally, prolonged exposure to GDNF family molecules, including GDNF and artemin, may prime the sensory neurons for activation. A clearer understanding of the alteration of sensory neuron sensitivity in normal and neurofibromin haploinsufficient neurons, and the intracellular mechanisms by which this alteration occurs, is critical in developing better therapies for NF1 associated pain and chronic pain states in general.  We hypothesize that GDNF and artemin alter sensory neuron sensitivity, and that this alteration is greater in Nf1 haploinsufficient mice than in wild type mice.  We will measure this modulated sensitivity using pain modeling behavioral assays and by measuring neuropeptide transmitter release from cultured neurons stimulated by known activators of sensory neurons.

We will measure this modulated sensitivity using pain modeling behavioral assays and by measuring neuropeptide transmitter release from cultured neurons stimulated by known activators of sensory neurons. Finally, we will determine whether this modulation of sensitivity is mediated via increased activation of the MAPK or PI3-K pathways.",50000,USD,50000,2007-07-31,2007,2009-07-31,2009,Brian Schmutzler,Indiana University,Indiana University Ð Purdue University Indianapolis,grid.257413.6,Indianapolis,Indiana,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.6418708,1109 Neurosciences,1109 Neurosciences,,,,,Rare Diseases; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Neurofibromatosis; Pain Research,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,Pain Conditions - Chronic,Neurofibromatosis,Pain Research,Neurological,Neurological,,,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,NF1 pain; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; Pain; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),NF1 pain,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final,Neuro (general) -Draft,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 2 - Aetiology; Rheumatoid Arthritis; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 2 - Aetiology,Rheumatoid Arthritis,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,100,grant.6418748,2007-01-C,Bone pseudarthrosis and fracture healing associated with neurofibromatosis,Bone pseudarthrosis and fracture healing associated with neurofibromatosis,"This project aims at understanding the defects in bone repair (pseudarthrosis) occuring in some patients affected by Neurofibromatosis (NF1) and to understand the role that Nf1 plays in this pathophysiological process. Bowing of the tibia and subsequent fracture occurs in 5% of babies affected by NF1, bringing a great deal of morbidity and burden to the patient and family because these fractures do not heal properly, leading to prolonged immobilization, recurent fractures, and in most severe cases to amputation. Our group has recently generated mice lacking Nf1 selectively in osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, and has shown that Nf1 is an inhibitor of bone formation and bone resorption. The phenotype of this mouse model also showed similarities with the local defects characterizing pseudarthrosis: exhuberant collagenous matrix production and increased osteoclast diferentiation and bone resorption. Furthermore, this study allowed us to characterize several signaling factors downstream of neurofibromin signaling in osteoblasts that represent new potential therapeutic targets (Elefteriou, Cell Met. 2006). Based on the nature of the multi-step process characterizing bone healing, which involves inflammation, formation of a cartilaginous callus, bone formation and mineralization and eventually remodeling of the callus, and on the expression of Nf1 in the critical cell types required for proper bone healing, we propose to use mice deficient for Nf1 in osteoblasts in a tibia fracture model to determine if absence of Nf1 impairs bone repair when osteoblasts build and remodel the new callus. The influence of an Nf1 heterozygote bone marrow environment in this mouse model will also be tested. We hypothesize that absence of Nf1 in osteoblasts will cause delayed or imperfect bone healing and if so, this mouse model will provide a valuable tool to identify at the molecular level the causes of pseudarthrosis and to test new treatments aimed at improving pseudarthrosis in NF1 patients.","This project aims at understanding the defects in bone repair (pseudarthrosis) occuring in some patients affected by Neurofibromatosis (NF1) and to understand the role that Nf1 plays in this pathophysiological process.

Thus, effective NF2 therapies must target the merlin effectors dysregulated upon merlin impairment. Studies from our laboratory indicate that merlin can suppress mitogen activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) group of mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs).  MAPKs are recruited as part of MAPK-kinase-kinase (MAP3K)/MAPK-kinase (MKK)/MAPK three-tiered core pathways.  B-Raf and Raf-1 are MAP3Ks for the ERKs and are recruited, via Ras, by mitogens to promote cell proliferation.  B-Raf and Raf-1 form a Ras-dependent complex wherein B-Raf can transactivate Raf-1.  We find that the integrity of this complex, and consequent activation of the ERKs requires, in a kinase-independent fashion, a second MAP3K, mixed-lineage kinase-3 (MLK3).  MLK3, through its kinase activity, also recruits a second group of MAPKs, the Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs), which, like the ERKs are key to cell proliferation.  We find that merlin, by binding and sequestering MLK3 directly blunts JNK activation and indirectly impairs ERK activation by disrupting the integrity of the MLK3/B-Raf/Raf-1 complex.  The Drosophila orthologues of merlin (dMer and the related protein expanded, Ex) also regulate an antiproliferative, proapoptotic signaling pathway which includes the protein kinase Hippo.  This pathway is tightly conserved in mammals, where mammalian Sterile-20-like kinase-2 (Mst2) is the mammalian Hippo orthologue.  In growing cells, Raf-1 binds and inhibits Mst2, thereby suppressing apoptosis.  These results suggest the following hypothesis, upon which the proposed studies are based:  MLK3, the Rafs and Mst2 exist in a Ras-dependent complex that signals (in part through ERK and JNK activation and suppression of Mst2) to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell death.  Merlin, through sequestration of MLK3 (and, perhaps by promoting the release of Mst2) dissociates this complex, imparing ERK and JNK activation and fostering Mst2 activation.  We will (i) use schwannoma cells expressing inducible constructs of wild type and disease-linked mutants of merlin to determine if induction of the merlin constructs dirsupts the endogenous MLK3/Raf/Mst2 complex.  We will (ii) use RNA interference to establish if MLK3 is required for the Mst2-Raf-1 interaction and to suppress Mst2 activity, and if Mst2, in a kinase-independent fashion, is required for maintenance of the B-Raf-Raf-1 complex.

The disorder is notable for having a broad clinical spectrum and an unpredictable course.  One severe clinical consequence of NF-1 is the progression of plexiform neurofibromas to aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).  The lifetime risk of MPNST in NF-1 patients is 8-10%.  NF-1 is caused by mutation of the gene coding for the neurofibromin protein, which acts as a GTPase activating protein for RAS and thus constrains RAS signaling.  With loss or malfunction of the NF1 gene product in Schwann cells, RAS signaling is dysregulated, leading to an invasive and hyper-proliferative phenotype.  Individuals who have NF-1 are at risk of developing other primary malignancies, particularly of connective tissue or the central nervous system, some of which are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionizing radiation.

The disorder is notable for having a broad clinical spectrum and an unpredictable course.  One severe clinical consequence of NF-1 is the progression of plexiform neurofibromas to aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).  The lifetime risk of MPNST in NF-1 patients is 8-10%.  NF-1 is caused by mutation of the gene coding for the neurofibromin protein, which acts as a GTPase activating protein for RAS and thus constrains RAS signaling.  With loss or malfunction of the NF1 gene product in Schwann cells, RAS signaling is dysregulated, leading to an invasive and hyper-proliferative phenotype.  Individuals who have NF-1 are at risk of developing other primary malignancies, particularly of connective tissue or the central nervous system, some of which are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionizing radiation.  A high incidence of secondary malignancies is observed in the NF-1 population treated with these methods, suggesting that depletion or absence of the NF1 gene product hinders the bodyÕs capacity to adapt to genotoxic stress, a conclusion which is supported by emerging evidence in NF-1 mouse models.

The hallmark feature of NF1 is the development of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors, termed neurofibromas, which arise either as dermal lesions or grow internally along the plexus of major nerves (plexiform).  While these tumors are benign, a subset of plexiform neurofibromas can progress to malignancy. We have been investigating the signals that restrict tumors to a benign state or promote the progression to malignancy. We have recently reported that loss of neurofibromin in some cell types leads to immortalization, while in other cell types leads to cellular senescence, and have begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which this occurs. Importantly, senescence in response to oncogenic stress (e.g. Ras activation, PTEN loss etc.) appears to play a critical role in restricting tumor development in humans and in murine models in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have detected a population of cells undergoing senescence only in benign dermal neurofibromas from NF1 patients. In this proposal we aim to further elucidate the signals that sensitize, or protect cells from senescence.

that spatial learning deficits are Ras-dependent.

Our group has recently demonstrated that the PI3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis in many human cancers, is activated in these benign tumors (Jacob et al, in press). We have also shown that OSU-03012, a novel PDK1 inhibitor derived from the COX2-inhibitor Celebrex, decreases cell proliferation, inhibits AKT and induces apoptosis in cultured schwannoma cells. New data from the thyroid cancer literature indicates that OSU-03012 may also be a PAK inhibitor, but this target has not been validated in schwannoma. Because loss of merlin (NF2-/- environments) results in upregulated PAK activity, we hypothesize that the observed in vitro efficacy of OSU-03012 against schwannomas rnay reßect both AKT and PAK inhibition. OSU-03012 may inhibit PAK by suppressing PDK1 activity (required for maximal PAK activation) but may also inhibit PAK directly by binding its ATP-binding domain. PAK mediates the effects of Rac/Cdc42 on the MAPK pathway by phosphorylating Raf1 at serine 338. Therefore, Raf1 phosphorylation can be used as a biologic assay of intracellular PAK activity.

Attempts at selectively targeting an individual transduction pathway such as the RAS pathway using farnesyltransferase inhibitors have shown limited effects on tumor growth in NF1 patients. This failure likely reflects the complicated and pleiotropic alterations in the signaling environment resulting from NF1 loss and suggests that a more viable therapeutic strategy might be to simultaneously target multiple rather than individual signaling events with a single drug. Molecular chaperone heat shock proteins have been identified as critical modulators of an extensive network of cellular signaling pathways including those leading to apoptosis, cell cycle progression and gene transcription. Not surprisingly, cancer cells often display markedly increased expression of chaperone proteins reflecting the efforts of malignant cells to maintain homeostasis in a hostile environment and to tolerate mutations in critical signaling molecules that would otherwise be lethal. The increased expression of chaperone proteins is predominantly mediated by heat shock transcription factor 1, HSF1, which binds to the heat shock element (HSE) found in the promoters of chaperone genes. The broad influence of chaperones on signaling networks, therefore, makes them interesting targets for therapeutic intervention with targeting HSF1 possibly representing a strategy for modulating the entire chaperone response and in turn numerous signaling pathways. In work performed by one of our post-doctoral fellows, Chengkai Dai, a current CTF Young Investigator, we have identified that HSF1 is required for Ras-mediated oncogenic transformation both in cell culture and in mice and for PDGF-mediated transformation in cell culture. In addition, we have shown that inhibition of HSF1 by a small molecule compound, triptolide, markedly decreases proliferation of human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells lines at nanomolar concentrations. For these reasons, we believe that developing robust clinically useful inhibitors of the HSF1-mediated heat shock response will provide a novel means for modulating several relevant signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type I. We have devised a robust high-throughput screen to be conducted at the Broad Institute where our group has successfully performed prior high-throughput small molecule screens and where I am currently an associate member and will be taking a sabbatical leave starting September 2007. Our strategy is to use suppression of the heat shock response as a screening endpoint with the immediate goal of generating small molecule lead compounds for preclinical development. The efficacy of these compounds will be evaluated in moderate throughput secondary assays using MPNST and high-grade glioma cell lines.

Although it takes over 12 months for these mutant mice to develop fullblown neurofibromas, we have identified pre-neosplastic phenotypes in mutant sciatic nerves as early as 3 months.  In sciatic nerves of 3 month old mutant mice, we identified a subset of nonmyelinating Schwann cells (nmSCs) as early tumor cells, which exhibit a spectrum of abnormalities. These abnormal nmSCs are either dissociated or dissociating from axons, accompanied by axonal degeneration and mast cell infiltration.

Altered mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activity was also observed at this stage, which may be underlying molecular mechanism of neurofibroma initiation. Based upon these observations, we propose that the earliest stage of neurofibroma development is the progressive dissociation of nmSCs from the axons that they ensheath.  Dissociation of nmSCs from axons is accompanied by axonal degeneration, leading to an acute inflammatory response as evidenced by the infiltration of mast cells in mutant nerves.

We have shown that plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs appear to arise from differentiated glia (Cancer Cell 13:129). This projectÕs objective is to determine if the progression of MPNSTs follows a cancer stem cell model, in which only a minority of cancer cells are capable of extensive proliferation or the formation of new tumors. To test this we will use mouse models for MPNSTs bearing mutations in Nf1, Ink4Arf and p53 as well as human tumor specimens. If we find that only a subset of cells drive tumor formation, we will attempt to isolate those MPNST-initiating (tumorigenic) cells and characterize their aberrant self-renewal properties. By generating compound mutant mice, we will test if the transcriptional co-factor Hmga2, which we have recently discovered to regulate the selfrenewal of neural crest stem cells and which is highly expressed in MPNSTs, is required for the formation or growth of MPNSTs. This is a particularly interesting question in light of our results demonstrating that MPNSTs arise from differentiated glia as it would test whether these glia acquire stem cell self-renewal mechanisms when they are transformed. Preliminary results suggest that a high proportion of cells isolated from MPNSTs are able to transfer disease when transplanted into syngenic mice, suggesting that these cancers do not follow a cancer stem cell model in contrast to many other cancers. This could help to explain why these cancers are so aggressive and refractory to therapy. The results of this study will show, if it will be sufficient to target a subset of cells or if all cells need to be targeted during the course of tumor therapy and might yield new insights into the mechanisms responsible for the aberrant growth and proliferation of MPNST cells.","About 10% of patients with neurofibromatosis develop MPNSTs, very aggressive and invasive soft tissue sarcomas, which are often refractory to chemo- and radiotherapy.

Clinically relevant mutations in the protein neurofibromin (NF1) have been shown to affect learning or long term memory in mouse and Drosophila models as well as humans. There are two main intracellular pathways influenced by NF1 that appear to separately regulate learning versus long-term memory. The carboxy terminal portion of NF1 increases activity of an AC/PKA pathway implicated in learning. Alternatively, the GAP domain of NF1 decreases Ras activity in the MEK/MAPK pathway affecting long term memory. Many inhibitory compounds already exist for these molecules and their downstream targets, including some drugs currently approved for use in humans. We hypothesize that compounds targeting the AC/PKA or MEK/MAPK pathways will have modulating effects on learning or long-term memory, respectively. Specific compounds will be administered to Drosophila acutely or chronically via ingestion. Both adult flies and larvae will be tested for learning and memory using established associative learning protocols. Adult flies will receive an electric shock paired with an odor, or heat punishment paired with visual stimulus, while larvae will receive a fructose reward paired with light or aversive odor.

Even with modern orthopaedic techniques, sound union is achieved in less than 50% of CPT patients. Permanent disability and/or amputation are common outcomes. The majority of CPT cases occur in children with Type 1 Neurofibromatosis (NF1). Using gene knockout mouse models, we and others have found that Nf1 haploinsufficient mice (Nf1+/-) exhibit abnormalities in the cells that contribute to bone formation and repair. We are currently exploring these cellular defects in a number of genetic mouse models of NF1 with an aim to test novel treatments for CPT.

We have developed a tibial fracture model that shows recalcitrant bone healing in the Nf1+/- mouse line. However, a recent clinical study has shown that pseudarthrotic tissues from NF1 patients can undergo a localized deletion of their second NF1 allele. Our new approach is to examine the effect of deleting both Nf1 alleles on bone healing. We will model this phenomenon using mice with a LoxP-flanked (floxed) Nf1 allele. The second allele will be specifically deleted by delivering Cre recombinase in two different ways. First, Nf1floxed/- mice will be mated with transgenic mice expressing tissue-specific Cre. We will make use of both Col3.6-Cre and Col2.3-Cre transgenic mouse strains; this will allow us to completely ablate Nf1 in osteoprogenitors or in differentiated osteoblasts respectively. Second, Nf1floxed/- will be infected with Creexpressing lentivirus to produce a localized loss of Nf1. Cre-lentivirus will be applied to cultured cells and to healing tibial fractures.

We aim to better understand the role of NF1 in bone and in CPT. We will examine the mechanism underlying the role of Nf1 in bone cell differentiation and function. We hypothesize that Nf1 has a key role in osteoblast differentiation and that osteogenesis will be significantly reduced in mice withNf1-/osteoprogenitors. We will generate a mouse model of CPT that recapitulates the loss of Nf1 heterozygosity that occurs in a clinical setting. This model will be an important tool for understanding the pathology of NF1 and CPT, and for the rational design of therapeutic strategies. Finally, we will use our current understanding of anabolic and anti-catabolic pharmaceutical therapies in bone to develop and test treatments for CPT. It is here that our mouse models of CPT will be a key resource.This study is likely to significantly enhance our understanding of bone repair in NF1 and will allow us to critically examine new methods for treating CPT.","Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a leading cause of leg amputation in children.

2. To describe and define the toxicities in pediatric patients on chronic dosing of sorafenib.
3. To evaluate for potential bone toxicities of sorafenib such as growth plate expansion and growth retardation using automated volumetric MRI analysis of growth plates, multiple measures for height and growth, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to evaluate bone mineral density, and laboratory measurements for evaluation of bone turnover and metabolism.

3. To determine the effect of sorafenib on PN blood flow by performing dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DEMRI) of PN pre-treatment and at steady state on treatment.
4. To measure adherence of sorafenib chronic dosing in this patient population.

However, most phenotypic manifestations of this genetic disorder have not been associated with specific point mutations in INI1. Furthermore, complete inactivation of INI1 is either lethal or leads to phenotypes different from that of schwannomatosis (usually rhabdoid tumor)(Biegel 2006; Roberts et al. 2000). DNA methylation and chromosomal structural rearrangements are possible, yet unexplored, components that may affect expression of this gene and other loci implicated in schwannomatosis in a subtle way that is required in the development of the disease.
  
In order to address this issue we have designed experimental assays based on custom microarrays and pyrosequencing, which we successfully validated in previous studies (Buckley et al. 2005a; Piotrowski et al. 2006). Next, we developed an array that enables analysis of copy number and methylation of INI1, NF2 and adjoining chromosome 22 regions (8.8 Mb in total) at an average resolution of <2.5 kb.

Finally, using genome-wide array-CGH, we will test the alternative hypothesis that there exist loci outside of chromosome 22 in the human genome, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of schwannomatosis and are affected by copy number aberrations.

Consequently, greater than 50% of NF1 patients with MPNSTs present with unresectable disease.  These inoperable tumors are often unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiation, therefore developing an effective treatment regimen is essential.

We and others have shown that MPNSTs are sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.  Although dramatic effects on tumor maintanence are observed with this drug in vivo, MPNSTs ultimately develop resistance and tumors re-grow.  Furthermore, rapamycin results in disruption of tumor microvasculature suggesting that MPNSTs may require re-stabilization of their microvasculature for re-growth (when resistance to rapamycin is achieved).  
The central hypothesis of these studies is to overcome single target resistance by inhibiting two key processes required for tumor growth, specifically, proliferation and neoangiogenesis.  These studies use a genetically engineered mouse model to assess whether the combination therapy of rapamycin and sunitinib should be developed in humans.  Using our mouse model we will assess the long term therapeutic effects of combination therapy on MPNSTs growth, the tumor microvasculature and evaluate the gene expression profiles of pro-angiogenic factors in rapamycin-resistant MPNSTs.  Together these studies should provide important insight into mechanisms of rapamycin resistance and may help to guide the development of future therapies.","An important feature of the familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type (NF1) is the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are highly aggressive and frequently metastasize.

Mutations in this gene have been found in most sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas, in a large fraction of malignant pleural mesotheliomas and, less frequently, in melanomas and some other tumors. Although many biological activities have been attributed to Merlin, the protein encoded by the nf2 gene, the mechanism by which Merlin inhibits cell proliferation and malignant transformation has remained unclear, probably because little headway has been made toward understanding its biochemical function and illustrating this function in physiological contexts. To understand MerlinÕs function in normal physiology and tumor suppression, our laboratory carried out tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis and identified a Merlin binding protein, DCAF1, which is the substrate receptor of a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Biochemical and genetic analysis suggested that inhibition of this E3 ligase is an important molecular function of Merlin in suppressing tumorigenesis. In further characterizing the interaction between Merlin and DCAF1, we found that Merlin can affect the protein level of DCAF1. In addition, these two proteins accumulate and interact in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, several tumor-derived mutants of Merlin can neither accumulate in the nucleus, nor bind to DCAF1. These results suggested an important function of Merlin in the nucleus, and that loss of such function may lead to cell hyperproliferation and transformation. Here, I will extend our findings and focus on testing the hypothesis that Merlin functions as a tumor suppressor to regulate the protein level of DCAF1 in the nucleus. The proposed studies will provide a new horizon for understanding the mechanism by which Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis, and will contribute to the development of new and more effective therapies for Neurofibromatosis type 2 and other cancers caused by loss of Merlin functions.","The nf2 gene was identified as the tumor suppressor inactivated in the familial cancer syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 2.

Understanding the molecular processes of the malfunctioning of synapses is crucial for the development of effective therapeutics for these learning disabilities. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin, the product of the NF1 gene, inactivates a signaling protein, Ras. Ras is required to change the shape and strength of synapses during learning and memory. Recent studies have demonstrated that hyper-activation of Ras causes learning deficits in an animal model of Neurofibromatosis type 1. Thus, our project will focus on elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Neurofibromin regulates Ras activity and the function of synapses.  Ras proteins are activated by NMDA receptors during normal learning. Thus, our hypothesis is that Neurofibromin regulates the function of synapses by inhibiting the activation of Ras by NMDA receptors.  Consistent with this hypothesis, our preliminary data shows that the number of synapses is reduced in neurons in which the level of Neurofibromin is reduced. Furthermore, this synapse elimination was blocked by inactivating NMDA receptors or Ras. These results indicate that, in synapses, Neurofibromin regulates Ras activation through NMDA receptors. To further follow the molecular process of synapse elimination by Neurofibromin removal, we have developed a technique to monitor the activation of Ras and NMDA receptor in individual synapses. Using these new techniques, we will study how the activation of Ras and NMDA receptors are changed in synapses of neurons with a reduced level of Neurofibromin.  This study is expected to elucidate how Neurofibromin regulates the activation of NMDA receptors and Ras, therefore controlling the morphology and function of synapses.

Therapies that target tumor neovascularization have potential to prevent, stop, or shrink tumors in NF1 (and NF2 and schwannomatosis). Our lab studies NF1 angiogenesis, and we propose to perform a pilot translational study to test whether a novel anti?VEGF drug from PTC Therapeutics, PTC299, is effective against NF1 tumor angiogenesis. PTC299 has advantages relative to the current drugs targeting VEGF signaling. First, PTC299 is orally bio?available and produced no adverse effects in a phase I trial of healthy
individuals. Second, its mechanism of action is novel and specific, post?transcriptionally preventing synthesis of functional VEGF rather than blocking signaling after the protein has been secreted. Third, it appears to have selective action in tumor cells compared to non?tumor cells, reducing the risk of adverse effects. In addition, PTC299 shrunk tumors in subcutaneous and mouse intracranial xenografts of other cancers in the companyÕs studies. Thus, PTC299 is a promising candidate for tumor therapy in NF1, and our group has an excellent in vivo model system for testing its efficacy. In our xenograft system, human NF1 tumor Schwann cells are injected into sciatic nerves of scid mice; the cells produce a neurofibroma (or MPNST?like tumor depending on original cells). In this pilot study we will test the robust MPNST cell lines sNF96.2 and sNF94.3, which produce visibly enlarged sciatic nerves by 8 weeks post?xenograft (histologically sNF96.2 produces an MPNST, sNF94.3 produces a plexiform neurofibroma). These xenografts show de novo blood vessel formation and express VEGF. We will test whether PTC299 can arrest NF1 tumor development in the live nerve environment. For each line, 12 mice will receive a xenograft in one sciatic nerve and receive treatment, while six control mice will have xenografts but will not receive the drug. At three months post?xenograft, the nerves will be harvested. Tumor growth in treated versus non?treated sciatic nerves, and angiogenesis and proliferation, will be analyzed. Positive results (impairment of tumor growth) would lead to expanded studies, whereas negative results would suggest that PTC299 is not a good candidate for NF1 tumor therapy. This work could also be very important in interpreting the results of the NF2 schwannoma PTC299 clinical trial recently initiated.

Despite our evolving knowledge of signaling pathways regulated by NF1, there is currently no effective medical therapy for NF1-related pathologies. Among the most serious complications of NF1 are plexifonn neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. These tumors are unusual in that they are composed of a mixture of Schwann cells, mast cells, fibroblasts, and perineural cells. In man, NF1 most often arises in the setting of homozygous loss of both Nf1 alleles in Schwann cells, with heterozygous loss in other tissues. In a conditional mouse model of the disease, it is not sufficient to lose both copies of the NH
gene in Schwann cells; loss of one copy of this gene is required in bone-marrow-derived cells, including mast cells. This unusual stromal dependency suggests that repair of the M1 gene in bone marrow derived cells could be used, in the setting of autologous transplant, as a therapy for NF1. Here, we propose to derive iPS cells from murine Nf1 heterozygote keratinocytes, repair the defective Nf1 allele, differentiate these repaired iPS cells to transplantable hematopoietic precursors, and transplant these cells into irradiated NF1 mice. We expect that this treatment, by providing a wild-type stroma, will delay or abolish NF1-related malignancies in these animals.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem genetic disorder in which affected individuals are predisposed to the development of a wide variety of disorders, including neurofibromas, optic gliomas, pigmentary features, skeletal abnormalities, vascular dysplasias, and learning disabilities.

The tumors are resistant to current treatment; standard of care is repeated surgical removal. The NF2 gene product, Merlin, is implicated in multiple signal transduction pathways Ñ suggesting that a variety of signaling aberrations contribute to molecular pathogenesis in NF2. The signaling pathways deregulated in NF2 overlap with those that are frequently deregulated in oncogenesis and are dependent on protein clients of the chaperone, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is required for the stabilization of these key signaling proteins; its inhibition results in their degradation. Thus, inhibition of Hsp90 results in the degradation of onoogenic proteins, many of which are implicated in NF2-related signaling pathways, such as ErbBZ and Akt. We hypothesize that an inhibitor of Hsp90 will have therapeutic beneÞt for NF2-related tumors.

Work from several labs indicates merlin functions as a negative regulator the p21-activated kinases (Paks). Recent studies from our lab employing RNAi Ð
based approaches and dominant-negative mutants have indicated that targeting the Paks would be beneficial as a treatment modality for NF2. We have taken a novel approach to identify compounds that selectively inhibit the p21-activated kinases, using novel scaffolds of organoruthenium compounds based on a staurosporine scaffold. These compounds are chemically stable and allow for the creation of a diversity of defined three-dimensional structures. Due to the structural nature of these scaffolds, these compounds are extremely rigid, which contributes to high selectivity towards their targets. We have identified and optimized a few lead compounds that inhibit the Paks and find that they function efficiently to inhibit Pak activity in cells.

Although numerous studies have shown that Merlin can control various signaling pathways in different cell types, no single Merlin?regulated pathway has emerged, likely because Merlin function is context dependent and most studies have focused on events downstream of primary site of Merlin action. Given that membrane localization is required for the growth suppressing function of Merlin, our goal has been to identify direct targets of Merlin at the membrane. We have discovered that a key function of Merlin is to physically associate with and negatively regulate the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) by controlling its membrane distribution and subsequent trafficking. We also found that pharmacologic inhibitors of EGFR efficiently block the overproliferation of Nf2?/? cells in vitro and in endogenously arising tumors in a novel mouse model suggesting that they may be of benefit to NF2 patients. Indeed, a very early study revealed some efficacy for erlotinib/Tarceva in treating
vestibular schwannoma in an NF2 patient. However, Merlin can control the surface availability of other ErbB receptors, either via dimerization with EGFR or via a similar mechanism; indeed, erlotinib does not completely halt the proliferation of all types of Nf2?/? cells. Moreover, the effects of erlotinib are cytostatic and reversible, which may be particularly relevant when considering the long?term treatment of slow?growing tumors in NF2. Therefore, a key next step would be to test compounds that block the activity of multiple ErbB receptors for prolonged periods of time.

Moreover, an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody reduced schwannoma cell proliferation in vitro. Collectively, this data suggests that abnormal signaling via EGFR and ErbB2 is a major contributor to tumor growth and progression in both sporadic and NF2-related vestibular schwannomas and that inhibition of this signaling pathway can result in decreased tumor growth.

Both cell lines are growth-inhibited by CNX-222 in vitro, and both cell lines grow as tumors in nude mice. For this study, Avila will provide us with the pan- ErbB inhibitor CNX-
222 to analyze in vivo growth inhibition of FC1801 and 01129-8 cells. The compound will be administered by oral gavage at 100mg/kg/day for the duration of the model (4 weeks). The experiment will include collection of blood for PK analysis (to be done at Avila), tumor tissue for PK/PD analysis, and normal tissue for PK/PD analysis (to be done as a collaboration between Avila
and Dr. GiovanniniÕs lab). The Giovannini lab and Avila Therapeutics will jointly review data from the experiments outlined above and discuss whether further experimentation should continue, which may include the genetically modified mouse schwannoma model.",30000,USD,30000,2009-12-01,2009,2010-12-01,2010,Marco Giovannini,House Ear Institute,House Clinic,grid.417670.3,Los Angeles,California,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.6418750,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,,,,Rare Diseases; Neurosciences; Cancer; Brain Disorders; Pediatric; Neurofibromatosis,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,Cancer,Brain Disorders,Pediatric,Cancer,Cancer,,,,,,,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,Neurofibromatosis type 2 (Not reviewed); Schwannoma; schwannoma/Vestibular ; Schwannoma/Vestibular - Final; Schwannoma - Final; NF2 vestibular schwannoma; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neuro (general) -Draft; Neurofibromatosis type 2 - Final,Neurofibromatosis type 2 (Not reviewed),Schwannoma,schwannoma/Vestibular ,Schwannoma/Vestibular - Final,Schwannoma - Final,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,,,100,grant.6418749,2009B-05-003,The Effect of Icmt Inhibitors on NF1 Cell Proliferation and Signaling,The Effect of Icmt Inhibitors on NF1 Cell Proliferation and Signaling,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a germ-line mutation on chromosome 17, inactivating the Nf1 gene. The Nf1 gene is a tumor suppressor that encodes a 250 kD protein known as neurofibromin. The best-characterized domain of neurofibromin is the Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. Loss of function of this domain, through somatic inactivation of the normal allele, relieves one of the restraints on the Ras/MAPK pathway in various cells, including Schwann cells, and leads to increased signaling that leads to nerve sheath tumors. Thus, much of the efforts to develop therapeutics for NF1 have focused on the Ras/MAPK pathway. Ras is biologically active only when associated with cellular membranes. Ras is targeted to membranes by a series of three post-translational modifications that include prenylation, proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. These modifications are catalyzed by three enzymes: farnesyl transferase, Ras converting enzyme 1, and isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt). These enzymes are each considered good targets for the development of inhibitors as anti-Ras drugs. We cloned and characterized Icmt and have identified two highly specific and potent inhibitors, PHA-533593E and PHA- 194517A. We propose to test these compounds in vitro on cell lines derived from NF1 patients to determine if they have anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects. To accomplish this we will use ST88-14 and NF90-8 cells as well as normal rat Schwann cells as controls. We will expose these cells to increasing concentrations of the two inhibitors or vehicle control and assay proliferation, contact disinhibited growth, Erk phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Previous studies indicated that mice heterozygous for a null mutation in NF1 show impairment of visual-spatial learning, deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) and an enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition in the hippocampus. A recent study by Silva and colleagues showed that the learning deficit arises from overactivity of the Ras pathway in interneurons but not in principal neurons. In addition, they showed that NF1 is involved in presynaptic function (release) rather than post-synaptic function. However, it is unclear why the activity of NF1 is restricted to interneurons since it is present in all neurons. In addition it is unclear why it is only involved in pre-synaptic Ras signaling.

NF1 is characterized by the formation of benign and malignant tumors particularly within nerve tissue, bone deformities, learning disabilities, and enhanced pain responses to both painful and normally non-painful stimuli. Although these abnormal pain sensations are common symptoms associated with the disease, the mechanism involved in these symptoms is unknown. Neurofibromin is a guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) that is responsible for accelerating the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, the inactive form of the p21Ras (Ras) small G-protein. While mainly considered a Ras-GAP, NF also may have Ras-independent effects. NF has been found to be an important modulator of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and cAMP concentrations within several model systems. NF likely regulates AC activation and cAMP concentrations within sensory neurons, but the effects of NF on the AC/cAMP signal cascade within adult murine sensory neurons have yet to be studied. Understanding NFÕs role within the AC/cAMP cascade might help to elucidate the mechanisms of NF1-associated pain. We hypothesize that NF is important for AC activation in sensory neurons. In order to test this hypothesis, we will measure basal and PGE2-induced AC activation and cAMP concentrations in wild-type and Nf1+/- sensory neuron cultures. We will also study the gene-dose effects of NF reduction on the AC/cAMP cascade activity by using siRNA and lentivirus techniques. By altering NF protein expression and studying the resultant PGE2-induced AC/cAMP cascade activity, we will causally relate changes of NF expression to alterations in the AC/cAMP pathway. We also hypothesize that reduced NF expression alters the pathways involved in neuronal sensitization. Based upon our preliminary data, wild-type neurons are sensitized by PGE2. Conversely, Nf1+/- neurons are not sensitized by PGE2. We will use stimulus-evoked neuropeptide release as an endpoint to study whether the loss in PGE2-induced sensitization is due to a direct effect of NF on the AC/cAMP cascade or an indirect effect via increased Ras-GTP levels. We will systematically block and activate the Ras and cAMP pathways with drugs and genetic techniques, and we will then observe the results of PGE2-treated and non-PGE2-treated stimulus-evoked neuropeptide release. It is important to understand the differences between neuronal sensitization in Nf1+/- and wild-type neurons in order to determine the mechanisms involved in pain sensations in people with NF1. This research will increase our understanding of the signaling pathways involved in sensitization of peripheral neurons with reduced NF concentrations. This will aid the medical community in designing effective therapies for people with NF1 who experience pain.

Primary cultures of Schwann cells from mice that lack Merlin have demonstrated associations between Merlin and mitogenic pathways, however the precise mechanism by which Merlin restricts cell growth and proliferation, and how that control is abrogated in these tumors, remains unclear. Studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that the hippo tumor suppressor pathway acts downstream of Merlin to restrain cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. It achieves this by two major mechanisms: through post-translational regulation by direct phosphorylation of substrates (such as DIAP1) and through transcriptional regulation by phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activator yorkie (which serves to inhibit transcription of DIAP1, Cyclin E and the microRNA bantam). Recently, studies in primary cultures of Merlin-deficient Schwann cells have concluded that the effect on proliferation is not mediated by transcriptional repression by YAP so we hypothesize that the kinase activity of hippo and warts may yield novel mitogenic effectors. Using the Drosophila In Vitro Expression Cloning (DIVEC) approach, we performed a genome-wide kinase substrate screen to identify substrates of hippo and warts using a phosphorylation induced gel-shift assay. From this we have identified 36 individual hits, 3 of which were found to have a putative role in mitotic progression and several which have a role in cell growth. My work in the lab has shown that one of these in vitro substrates Rae1 genetically interactswith other known mitotic regulators in vivo in Drosophila and was found to be degraded in cells upon co-transfection of hippo or warts - suggesting that its phosphorylation promotes the instability of Rae1 protein. Other groups have reported that the gene is unregulated in astrocytomas, retinoblastomas and in malignant glioma tissue. In this study, we will use Drosophila to characterize the role of these substrates. We hypothesize that some hippo and wartssubstrates could represent important effectors of Merlin, whose levels are differentially regulated in patients with NF2.These may represent genetic modifiers of the NF2 disease phenotype (for example, accounting for the difference in morbidity and mortality between the Wishart (severe) and Gardner (mild) subtypes of the disease) or, more interestingly, could serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of NF2.","Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant familial syndrome which is caused by loss of function mutations in the Nf2/Merlin gene, predisposing carriers to develop tumours of the central nervous system.

We and others have demonstrated that NF1-inactivation results in the aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. Human MPNST cells are very sensitive to mTOR inhibitors like Rapamycin. Rapamycin also immediately halts tumor growth and prolongs survival of a genetically engineered mouse model for MPNSTs.

There are differences of opinion as to whether observation, microsurgery or radiosurgery is more effective in hearing preservation. A major concern of many is that radiosurgery and radiotherapy may induce malignancy, including secondary meningiomas and multiple small tumors. However, other than individual case reports, the NF2 community lacks thorough data on the risks, benefits and outcome of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. In the first aim we will investigate the in vivo response of Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma cells to irradiation by monitoring the early neoplastic cellular and vascular responses in orthotopic xenograft and syngraft mouse models treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Cohorts of tumor-bearing mice will be subjected to stereotactic radio surgery using different parameters (total dose, number of isocenter, dose repartition planning). Tumor growth will be monitored using small animal volumetric MRI. Response to treatment will be evaluated by comparing average tumor volumes in treated and untreated (sham irradiation) groups. Histopathological changes will be analyzed on tumor samples after irradiation (apoptosis, vascular changes, DNA damage). In the second aim we will validate the preclinical efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery in a genetically modified mouse model of NF2-related schwannoma. Results of in vitro testing suggest a relative radioresistance of schwannoma cells. However, due to the higher mitotic activity, mouse NF2-deficient Schwann cell lines might show a relatively higher sensibility to ionizing radiations. Therefore, to assess the effect of SRS on schwannoma growth we will use a genetically modified NF2 mouse model that develops tumors histologically similar to human schwannomas. The high rate of tumor development occurring with a predictable time course makes now this model quite tractable for therapeutic testing. Final SRS planning to be used in the in vivo anti-NF2 tumor activity study will be guided by the results in Aim 1. Finally, we will focus on radiation-induced sensineural hearing loss (SNHL) in preclinical NF2 mouse models. Recent clinical reports indicate that patients receiving radiotherapy that includes the auditory system in the treatment volume are likely to develop an irradiation-induced SNHL. We will measure the dose of radiation delivered to the auditory system during a gamma knife surgery procedure for the treatment of NF2 mice, to analyze the relationship between irradiation, hearing outcome, measured as a combination of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion products of otoacoustic emissions (DPOEAs), and histopathology in these mice.","Use of radiosurgery and radiotherapy for NF2 management is highly controversial, with some physicians utilizing this and others not.

NF1 is caused by loss of neurofibromin, which serves as a negative regulator of Ras. Drosophila melanogaster lacking a conserved NF1 ortholog are reduced in size and display learning defects. Both defects resemble human NF1 symptoms and are restored by increasing cAMP/PKA signaling  However, how loss of NF1 affects the cAMP-PKA pathway remains largely unknown. To investigate this issue my sponsorÕs laboratory recently conducted genetic screens to identify deficiencies that modify the NF1 growth defect. Approximately 30 suppressing deficiencies that each uncover between 1 and 50 genes have been identified. Confirmed or candidate modifiers include highly conserved genes encoding, among others, the neuroendocrine Ret and Alk Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, a neuropeptide receptor and its ligand, components of the synaptic machinery, and proteins involved in vesicular transport. Importantly, studies in my current laboratory revealed that overactivation of the neuronal Alk tyrosine kinase phenocopies both NF1 growth and learning defects, whereas its genetic and pharmacologic inhibition suppresses both deficits. These data argue that Alk and NF1 function in a common signaling pathway responsible for both defects. For this project we propose to identify novel components of NF1 signaling, by testing whether the candidate genes that modify the NF1 growth defects also modify the learningimpairments. Our planned strategy involves genetic epistasis experiments coupled with molecular, histological and meaningful behavioral analyses, using the well established Pavlovian associative olfactory learning model. In addition, we will assess whether these candidate genes affect learning as a consequence of developmental alterations or of adult specific plasticity, by using a conditional temperature-sensitive system that will allow transgenes to be induced during development or specifically in normal sized adults. Finally, where possible, we will use a pharmacologic approach to specifically modulate target activity in vivo in an attempt to rescue Nf1-mutant learning deficiencies. We expect from this unique multidisciplinary study that combines both growth and behavioral phenotypes, to identify new molecular targets involved the regulation of a common NF1-dependent signalingpathway. If successful, our work may provide avenues towards the development of highly-selective pharmaceuticals for the amelioration of both short stature and behavioral/cognitive impairments associated with NF1.","Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common inherited disorder affecting 1 in 3,000 Among its hallmarks are tumors of the nervous system and learning disabilities.

In making treatment decisions, or for evaluation of medical treatment in clinical care or clinical trials, it is important that clinicians can determine whether a lesion is growing, and if so, at what rate.  VS and PN usually remain benign, so if the tumor has a slow growth rate it may not be necessary to undergo the potential complications and risks of radiation therapy or surgical removal. However, if the tumor is growing quickly, knowledge about lesion size and growth rate can help the clinician in advising when to initiate treatment before the tumor grows large enough to put pressure on critically vital organs. 
	To assess the relative sensitivity to growth of linear and volumetric measurements, we evaluated linear diameter and volumetric measurements in 15 VS lesions, and found that linear measures underestimated volumetric growth by 50% on average.  In PN lesions, which are more complex and irregular than VS, linear measures are even less reliable and volumetric measurement more challenging.  Unfortunately, the current state of practice does not typically include longitudinal volumetric measurements for accurate tracking of changes in lesion volume. Volumetric measurements often involve complex analysis of multiple imaging studies and most facilities possess neither the technology nor the dedicated manpower to make these measurements in a reliable and time-efficient manner.  This frequently results in difficulty in determining if individual lesions have grown in size, and can lead to delays in critical clinical care decisions. Furthermore, patients may be scanned at different facilities over time, and current imaging exams may be read without access to prior studies for comparison.  
From 2003-2006, the ChildrenÕs Tumor Foundation provided pilot funding to help develop the technical infrastructure to create a centralized service to receive MRI scans from multiple institutions, perform VS and PN volumetric analyses, and post the resulting images, graphs, and data results in a secure, Web-based system for longitudinal tracking, viewable remotely by referring physicians (NF Imaging Metrics Service: www.nftumormetrics.org).  We implemented this system locally at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and piloted it with select outside hospitals, including University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), Johns Hopkins Hospital, Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC), and House Ear Institute, and as far away as Sydney, Australia.

People with NF1 often have learning disabilities and other cognitive symptoms. The mechanisms by which mutations of the neurofibromin gene (NF1) cause these deficits are not known. Learning and memory deficits also are observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-). Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that contribute to learning and memory deficits in NF1. Recently, direct interactions of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) Ð a protein involved in neurite outgrowth, guidance and axonogenesis Ð and neurofibromin have been demonstrated. In addition, we have demonstrated that CRMP-2 associates with and influences the function of presynaptic Ca2+ channels involved in transmitter release. We also have demonstrated that CRMP-2 influences axonal outgrowth and synaptic connectivity of neurons in the brain. Based on these results, we hypothesize that a lack of neurofibromin in NF1 alters CRMP-2 function leading to impaired axonal connections and transmitter release that results in abnormal learning and cognitive function. The experiments outlined in this proposal will identify transmission regulatory peptides (TRAPs) that uncouple the interaction between neurofibromin and CRMP-2 and then use these TRAPs to the neurofibrominÐCRMP-2 signaling cascade and its effects on synaptic transmission in sensory neurons from wildtype and Nf1+/- mice. Specifically, we will determine: 1) the exact site(s) of interactions between neurofibromin and CRMP-2 using a robotic highthroughput peptide tiling method combined with far-Westerns; 2) explore toxicity and in vitro uptake of various cell-penetration peptide conjugates (e.g., antennapedia, TAT, polyarginine) of these neurofibromin and CRMP-2 interaction disrupting peptides (i.e., the TRAPs); and 3) measure release of the peptide transmitter calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) from sensory neurons of wildtype and Nf1+/- mice treated with these TRAPs conjugated to optimal cell-penetrating peptides. Future studies will test the effects of the TRAPs on voltage-gated ion channels (e.g., Na+ and Ca2+), neuronal excitability and behavior (e.g., the Morris water maze learning and memory test). As proof-of-principle of our approach, we have successfully used the robotic SPOTS blot strategy to identify a short peptide that not only uncouples the interaction between CRMP-2 and Ca2+ channels but also dramatically reduces transmitter release in sensory neurons from Nf1+/- mice. Utilization of these TRAPs in wildtype and Nf1+/- mice will provide early indications of the potential usefulness of these molecules in clinical trials in humans.","Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by the formation of multiple benign and malignant tumors.

NF1 is caused by heritable mutations in the Neurofibromin (Nf1) gene which encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the Ras pathway. The loss of Nf1 affects many diverse cellular functions in a variety of tissues that is reflected by the wide range of Nf1-associated diseases. The tumor suppressor function of Nf1 is well known and recent studies indicate somatic mutations or LOH in 23% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Despite much effort to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Nf1 that associate with disease, it remains a serious challenge to identify modifiers or potential targets for therapeutic development. Because of its well-established genetic and chemical screening capacities, zebrafish has become a powerful model of human disease for employing in vivo drug screening strategies. For this proposal our group has recently developed Nf1 loss-of-function mutants that exhibit phenotypes that selectively affect tissues derived from the neural crest and are also affected in NF1 patients. We have developed tissue-specific transgenic reporter lines and crossed them into the Nf1 mutant that exploit the clarity of the zebrafish that allow the direct visualization of these developing tissues in vivo to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying these tissue defects. Here, we propose to conduct a pilot drug screen based on our zebrafish Nf1 model to assess the effects of known FDA-approved drugs, as well as therapeutics already being used to treat Nf1 patients or that are in current clinical trials. These studies will identify new potential drugs and offer new insights into the functional role of Nf1 in development and tumor predisposition, thereby providing new targets for therapeutic development for the treatment of Nf1-associated diseases.","Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is the most common autosomal dominant genetic disease that predisposes to tumorigenesis.

We have developed tissue-specific transgenic reporter lines and crossed them into the Nf1 mutant that exploit the clarity of the zebrafish that allow the direct visualization of these developing tissues in vivo to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying these tissue defects. Here, we propose to conduct a pilot drug screen based on our zebrafish Nf1 model to assess the effects of known FDA-approved drugs, as well as therapeutics already being used to treat Nf1 patients or that are in current clinical trials. These studies will identify new potential drugs and offer new insights into the functional role of Nf1 in development and tumor predisposition, thereby providing new targets for therapeutic development for the treatment of Nf1-associated diseases.",30000,USD,30000,2010-12-01,2010,2011-12-01,2011,A Thomas Look,Department of Pediatric Oncology,DanaÐFarber Cancer Institute,grid.65499.37,Boston,Massachusetts,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477821,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,,,,Rare Diseases; Human Genome; Brain Cancer; Biotechnology; Neurosciences; Cancer; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Pediatric; Neurofibromatosis,Rare Diseases,Human Genome,Brain Cancer,Biotechnology,Neurosciences,Neurological,Neurological,,,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors; 5.1 Pharmaceuticals,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,5.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final,Neuro (general) -Draft,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 2 - Aetiology; RAC 5 - Treatment Development; Oncology 1 Glioblastoma; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 2 - Aetiology,RAC 5 - Treatment Development,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system100,grant.5477768,2010B-12-003,Small molecule screen to identify inhibitors of NF2-mediated Yap1 activation,Small molecule screen to identify inhibitors of NF2-mediated Yap1 activation,"The goal of this DDI award is to make use of an existing human schwannoma cell-line (HEI-193) for a small molecule screen.

In addition to tumors, NF1 patients suffer from bone diseases including osteoporosis and pseudarthrosis Ð severe non-healing fractures that often require amputation. Genetic studies in Nf1OB-/- mice (with Nf1-/- osteoblasts) have suggested that deficient osteoblast bone formation may lead to recalcitrant fracture repair in NF1.

By identifying the role of Wnt signaling in Schwann cell tumorigenesis, we hope to develop novel, targeted therapies that are desperately needed to treat patients.",56000,USD,56000,2011-07-31,2011,2013-07-31,2013,Adrienne Watson,University of Minnesota Twin Cities - Twin Cities,University of Minnesota,grid.17635.36,Minneapolis,Minnesota,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477789,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,,,,,Biotechnology; Rare Diseases; Neurosciences; Cancer; Neurofibromatosis,Biotechnology,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,Cancer,Neurofibromatosis,Cancer,Cancer,,,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,MPNST; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); MPNST; Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; NF1 MPNST; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),MPNST,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),MPNST,Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 2 - Aetiology; Oncology 1 Glioblastoma; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 2 - Aetiology,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,100,grant.5477804,2011-02-001,Creating preclinical models of surgery for spinal schwannomas,Creating preclinical models of surgery for spinal schwannomas,"Schwannomatosis (SW) belongs to a family of neurocutaneous syndromes characterized by rare underlying genetic conditions predisposing to the development of nerve sheath tumors.

The cardinal feature of schwannomatosis is chronic pain which occurs in the majority of patients. Current treatments for schwannomatosis-related pain are inadequate. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived growth factor (BDNF), substance P (SP), and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) are proteins that have been shown to mediate pain in humans and animals.

The specific aims of this study include: (1) to determine the expression of NGF, BDNF, SP, and CGRP in human schwannomas taken from patients with solitary tumors, NF2, and schwannomatosis, and (2) to measure the concentrations of soluble NGF, BDNF, SP, and CGRP in blood and urine samples taken from schwannomatosis patients and correlate levels with pain severity anjd whole-body tumor burden.

with minimal shedding of virus. Based on our preclinical efficacy studies, we propose a Phase I
clinical trial to test the safety of direct intratumoral injections of HSV1716 in adolescents and young
adults with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumors. We will test our hypothesis in two specific
aims: (1) Assess the safety and feasibility of single and repeated intratumoral HSV1716
administration in adolescents and young adults with relapsed cancer, and (2) Determine the
incidence of HSV1716 virus spread following intratumoral virus injection. This study will be the first
clinical step in developing HSV1716 as a new method of local control for non-CNS solid

inflammatory cells, neoangiogenesis and alterations of the extracellular matrix. Our previous work
provided genetic, cellular, and biochemical evidence that haploinsufficiency of Nf1 alters Ras activity
and cell fates in mast cells and that c-kit activation of the hematopoietic system is required in the
initiation of plexiform tumor formation in a murine model. In this application, we propose to build on
these observations to identify the underpinning mechanisms of how c-kit mediates its biological
effects, and to identify experimental processes that would complement c-kit mediated experimental
therapeutics in the clinic. Three basic processes will be examined. First, kit activation is known to
cooperate with integrin signals in enabling myeloid cells to adhere to blood vessel walls and emigrate
from the blood to the emerging tumor. We have recently established that Nf1+/- mast cells
preferentially adhere to alpha4beta1, an integrin that has a key role in mast cell adhesion to
endothelium and in local sites of inflammation. We hypothesize that alpha4beta1 is crucial in the
recruitment of Nf1+/- mast cells to the tumor microenvironment in promoting local mast cell
proliferation and survival, and in the secretion of molecules that promote neoangiogenesis. We
propose studies to test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo. Second, MMPs are secreted molecules
that promote the release of preformed growth factors to the circulation and degrade the extracellular
matrix of tissues allowing invasion of inflammatory and stromal cells leading to tumor progression. In
preliminary studies we detect one specific MMP that is preferentially expressed and activated.
Studies to specifically test the role of this protease are proposed. Finally, the specific downstream
paracrine signals that lead to alterations of the extracellular matrix and neoangiogenesis are
incompletely understood. Tumor-associated macrophages are known to enhance neoangiogenesis
and facilitate malignant outgrowth. We recently established that large populations of angiogenic
macrophages are found in peripheral blood and in the neurofibromas of Krox20;Nf1flox/- mice. We
hypothesize that macrophage recruitment and their role in neoangiogenesis is a key downstream
event following mast cell recruitment to the tumor and, therefore, processes that inhibit this activity
will prevent or delay tumor progression. Adoptive transfer experiments are proposed to test this

In addition to many benign manifestations, NF1 patients are predisposed to several cancers that are currently incurable. These include malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), astrocytoma/glioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. As part of an effort to identify new anti-cancer agents, scientists at the National Cancer Institute-Frederick (NCI-F) have discovered a family of natural products with great promise for treatment of CNS-derived tumors. When the natural source proved to be unreliable for isolation of more material, a laboratory synthesis was conducted at the University of Iowa leading to preparation of 7 of the 9 natural products and a number of analogues. These compounds have been provided to the NCI-F, tested there in cell-based assays, and some of those with greatest promise have been tested in mouse assays. These assays exploit a mouse model of NF1, also developed at NCI-F, carrying mutations in Nf1 and Trp53 linked together on chromosome 11. These mice develop spontaneous MPNSTs, astrocytomas, and pheochromocytomas. Recently published data has shown that loss of neurofibromin increases signaling downstream of Rho, and it has been suggested that inhibition of Rho signaling may provide new therapeutic options for NF1. We have tested the effects of the rare, parent natural product on astrocytoma tumor lines from our NF1 mouse model, and found that it dramatically affects cell proliferation. Furthermore, it inhibits induced Rho activity in astrocytoma cell lines, and restoration of the NF1-GRD domain to KR158 cells (p53-/-, NF1 -/-) induced resistance. Because of its specificity for brain tumor cell lines in the NCI 60 cell line panel, a drug derived from this lead may prove applicable to the many nervous system tumors found in NF1 patients. One synthetic analog, Sch-620, shows very similar activity in the NCI 60 cell line panel as well as significant activity in vivo when mice are challenged with an MPNST cell line. In this proposal we request support to prepare a large sample of Sch-620 for further mouse studies. This material will be provided to NCI-F for further testing in mice with an intact immune system and blood-brain barrier. The resulting data can be used in collaboration the NCI Preclinical Consortium Center to design clinical trials.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic diseases of the nervous system, affecting ~1 in 3500 people.

Moreover, this elevated level of metabolic stress is suppressed by autophagy inducers, including rapamycin and lithium. Therefore, we hypothesize that Merlin normally suppresses tumorigenesis in part by activating autophagy, and that this new role of Merlin in autophagy could be a target for therapeutic intervention against NF2-associated tumors.

In this grant, we propose to test the treatment of this fracture repair model with PD0325901 as well as AZD6244, an alternative MEK inhibitor currently in clinical trials. In a preliminary mouse experiment we found that ongoing systemic treatment with PD0325901 decreased fibrosis and increased cartilage in the Nf1null fractures. Based on the normal progression of cartilage generation and subsequent ossification in endochondral repair, we speculate that timed early treatment with MEK inhibitors may facilitate early soft (cartilaginous) callus formation. Ceasing inhibitor treatment after soft callus establishment should permit ossification and eventual union. This experiment represents a new and targeted drug therapy for augmenting bone repair in CPT and builds upon a large body of expertise in NF1 fracture models in mice.

The main objectives of this study are to understand the mechanisms leading to NF1 PA, to generate a valid pre-clinical mouse model of Nf1 PA, and to use it to assess the efficacy of specific drugs in improving fracture healing. The focal/unilateral nature of NF1 PA, its progressive nature and the case of NF1 LOH observed in patients with NF1 PA suggest that this condition is caused by NF1 loss of function in multipotent dividing bone forming cells.

This mouse model allows us to inactivate neurofibromin activity in the main cells contributing to bone healing at different time points, during development (embryonic, growing or adult mice) and during the various phases of the bone healing process, simply by stopping doxycycline treatment. Based on the improved cell specificity of this model and the possibility of inactivating Nf1 after birth, these mice are expected to have a normal size at time of fracture (as opposed to other existing relevant models based on osteochondroprogenitor cell permanent gene inactivation) allowing us to perform well-controlled fracture studies. We propose in Aim 1 to thoroughly analyze this model (already available in our laboratory), focusing on the analysis of its general skeletal phenotype and tibia healing properties. The influence of an Nf1 heterozygote bone marrow environment in this mouse model will also be tested. We hypothesize that inactivation of Nf1 specifically in osteoprogenitors will cause delayed or imperfect bone healing and if that is the case, we will determine whether C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), an antagonist of ERK, will correct the proliferation, differentiation and function of Nf1-/- osteoprogenitors in vitro, via it ability to inhibit ERK activation.

I will address these questions using both classical genetic and transgenic techniques, cell biology in cultured Drosophila cells to measure HSW pathway activation, and protein biochemistry using whole tissue.",64000,USD,64000,2012-08-03,2012,2014-08-03,2014,Alexander Schulz,Leibniz Institute for Age Research - Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI),Fritz Lipmann Institute,grid.418245.e,Jena,,Germany,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477727,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,,,,Genetics; Rare Diseases; Neurosciences; Neurofibromatosis,Genetics,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,Neurofibromatosis,,Generic Health Relevance,Generic Health Relevance,,,,,1.1 Normal biological development and functioning,1.1 Normal biological development and functioning,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neuro (general) -Draft; Neurofibromatosis type 2 - Final,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),Neuro (general) -Draft,Neurofibromatosis type 2 - Final,,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 1 - Underpinning; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 1 - Underpinning,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,,100,grant.5477730,2012-01-036,Sex Differences in Cyclic AMP Signaling Impact NF1-associated Gliomagenesis,Sex Differences in Cyclic AMP Signaling Impact NF1-associated Gliomagenesis,"The sexual disparity in the incidence of pediatric brain tumors is poorly understood. In published and preliminary studies, we developed a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)associated glioma formation that recapitulates a sex-dependent pattern of tumorigenesis. In this model, we found that Cyclic AMP (cAMP) suppression is sufficient to induce glioma, but only in male mice. The clinical relevance of this finding was strengthened by Affymetrix SNP array analysis on DNA samples from 89 NF1 patients with or without optic pathway glioma (OPG). Consistent with the results from our tumor induction model, multiple SNPs in several components of the cAMP pathway were correlated with NF1 OPG in a sex-dependent manner. Further, our preliminary studies also demonstrated that male and female Nf1-/- astrocytes exhibited different levels of intracellular cAMP and the cAMP-regulated cell cycle inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1), a multi-functional player in both tumor suppression and oncogene induced senescence. Consistent with the sex-dependent differences in p21 expression, Nf1-/- astrocytes showed sex dependent differences in cellular senescence following Nf1 loss, and in their susceptibility to oncogenic transformation in response to overexpression of a dominant-negative p53 (DN-p53) molecule and treatment with EGF. Based on these results, we hypothesize that cell-intrinsic differences in growth regulatory pathways, including the cAMP pathway and the p53-p21 pathway, confer male and female tumor progenitors with differential sensitivity to transforming events. We have two specific aims to address our hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: Define the mechanisms through which sex and cAMP affect p21 levels.

We show that Nf1-deficient SKPs can give rise to classic plexiform or dermal neurofibromas contingent on their microenvironment, and further loss of p53 robustly generates MPNSTs, but the tumorigenic potential of Nf1-/-;p53-/- SKPs pales in comparison to the cells derived from developed MPNSTs, which suggests that loss tumor suppressors Nf1 and p53 is required but not completely sufficient for tumor development. These findings suggest the SKPs can be a powerful, new tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms of MPNST initiation and progression. We hypothesize that further genetic or epigenetic changes in addition to loss of both Nf1 and p53 are required for MPNST initiation and progression. Our study will utilize the SKP model of MPNST in order to capitalize on profiling technologies, in vitro genetic manipulation techniques, and to monitor the evolution of tumorigenesis from a stem cell all the way to MPNST while existing models will not permit us to do so.

Loss of NF2/Mer function leads to tumorigenesis in both humans and animal models. Mer, together with the structurally similar protein Expanded (Ex), normally inhibits the activity of the oncoprotein Yorkie/YAP, a transcriptional co-activator for genes that promote growth and inhibit cell death. Though the core components of the HSW pathway are well characterized, the mechanism regulating activation of the pathway at the level of whole tissues remains elusive. Recent studies from mammalian tissue culture and mouse models suggest that HSW pathway signaling is responsive to mechanosensation and changes in cell:cell contact. Other recent work has implicated Merlin as a partner of alpha-catenin in formation of the adherens junction. Alpha-catenin also acts as a key tumor suppressor upstream of YAP. This proposal will evaluate whether Merlin (and its partner Ex) function at the apical junctions of epithelial cells to regulate HSW signaling.   Intriguingly, Mer and Ex undergo a subtle change in localization in HSW mutant tissue, becoming less diffuse at the membrane and more junctionally concentrated. This proposal will address whether there is a functional significance to that change in localization. It is possible that these changes are the result of transcription through Yorkie, but preliminary evidence suggests a different feedback mechanism through local events at the apical membrane. This proposal will thoroughly investigate the possibility that the core HSW pathway feeds back onto upstream activators at the apical membrane independently of Yki-based transcription.","The NF2 gene product Merlin (Mer) has recently been shown to regulate the Hippo-SalvadorWarts (HSW) tumor suppressor pathway in both Drosophila and mammals.

The only curative therapy is bone marrow transplantation, though approximately half of patients die within 2 years of diagnosis despite this intensive therapy. The incidence of JMML is increased 500-fold among individuals with Neurofibromatosis Type 1, and in these cases biallelic inactivation of NF1 and increased Ras activation are found. The importance of Ras signaling in JMML is further indicated by the high prevalence of mutations that activate this pathway in sporadic cases. Together, mutations in NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, or CBL account for nearly all cases of JMML. However, despite the wealth of evidence implicating hyperactive Ras signaling in JMML, no central target for signal transduction therapy of JMML has been established. We have generated models of JMML in mice that can be induced to delete Nf1 or express an activated KrasD12 allele in the bone marrow. Each of these lesions produces a fatal neoplasm characterized by myelomonocytic proliferation and anemia, with complete penetrance, that closely resembles JMML. Further, Nf1-/- and KrasD12 bone marrow progenitors demonstrate cytokine independent growth in vitro and cell-intrinsic hypersensitivity to cytokine stimulation. We have developed a novel assay system that measures proliferation in a highly clonogenic population of primary cells sorted from murine bone marrow. Given the complexity of cellular signaling networks, we hypothesize that various kinases may have unexpected roles in growth regulation downstream of hyperactive Ras. We propose to screen a small, diverse and highly curated library of 160 kinase inhibitors for the ability to selectively inhibit proliferation of myeloid progenitors derived from Nf1??/?? and KrasD12 mice. Compounds that antagonize both Nf1-/- and KrasD12 progenitor cells will be excellent candidates to evaluate in vivo for activity against JMML.","Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a relentless myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood.

We have also demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic restoration of Ras signaling pathways to wildtype levels is sufficient to correct the neurofibromin cell phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.

Ras is at the apex of a series of signaling cascades, including the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk, PI3K, and Rho pathways. Given the complexity of the downstream signaling pathways, the most ideal treatment strategy for NF1 is to reduce pathological activation of Ras signaling itself. Historically, substantial effort has been devoted towards developing inhibitors of the farnesyl transferase (FT) protein2,3 because prenylation of Ras is required for its activity. Unfortunately, FT inhibitors did not stop the formation of activated Ras because the protein was activated by an alternative pathway involving geranylgeranyltransferase I when FT was blocked. Consequently, blocking Ras farnesylation had limited success in vivo in murine models or in human clinical trials. Interestingly, the farnesoid compounds that we will describe in this application appear to dislodge Ras-GTP from the plasma membrane and prevent it from activating key downstream signaling pathways.

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in regulating multiple aspects of cell fate including: proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The anti-proliferation/tumor-growth ability of MEK inhibitors has been shown in our human in vitro schwannoma model as well as in NF1 patient MPNST cell xenografts. However drug specificity, side effects and drug resistance are problems when inhibiting this ubiquitous pathway and therefore it would be very useful to identify a more specific therapeutic target. Scaffold proteins have been shown to ensure specificity of cellular signaling by providing spatial and temporal control in these universal pathways. Our work in NF2 has led to the discovery of the relevance of a highly specific scaffold protein for the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1). Our preliminary data show that knockdown of KSR1 inhibits the proliferation, increases apoptosis and reverts multipolar tumor cells back to bipolar normal cell-like morphology in human primary schwannoma cells. Three lines of evidence further support that KSR1 could be an interesting target to treat NF2 and also NF1: (1) KSR1 is highly specific to oncogenic but not normal Ras signaling; (2) KSR1 is specific to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is one of the most important growth factors for schwannoma cells and invasion inducing factor for MPNST; (3) knockdown of KSR1 in S462, a MPNST cell line, reduces cell number in a viability test. Therefore we hypothesize that KSR1 is relevant to the development of NF1 as well as NF2-related tumors and could be a potential therapeutic target for both diseases and could add specificity to inhibiting oncogenic Ras-ERK signaling. In this project, our aim is to determine whether KSR1 is a regulator of schwannoma and MPNSTÕs proliferation and/or apoptosis (survival) using three complementary approaches to inhibit KSR expression and/or activity: (1) additional lentiviral shRNA; (2) dominant negative mutant; (3) xenografts tested antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN).

Recent evidence from Drosophila indicates that Merlin acts upstream of the Hippo growth control pathway, a highly conserved kinase cascade that regulates growth and tumorigenesis in both Drosophila and mammals. This discovery has shed light on how Merlin exerts its tumor suppressor function, but it is still unclear how Merlin controls Hippo pathway activity, especially in vivo. A clearer mechanistic understanding of how Merlin regulates downstream effectors is key to our understanding of Merlin's tumor suppressor function. To better understand how Merlin regulates Hippo pathway activity in vivo, we plan to develop optical biosensors that report the activity of Hippo pathway kinases with high spatial and temporal resolution. Using these biosensors together with more conventional readouts of pathway activity, we will determine the point of action of Merlin in Hippo signaling in Drosophila tissues.

These mechanisms are commonly dysregulated in cancer. A pivotal regulator of anti-proliferative/growth control signaling is Merlin, the product of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, originally identified as the gene mutated in Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF2 is an inherited disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 30,000 births, and characterized by the development of schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve. Merlin, the NF2-coded protein, localizes to tight and adherens junctions and coordinate intercellular contact with subsequent inhibition of growth-promoting signaling pathways, including Ras, Rac, Src, and mTOR, and has recently been linked to the Hippo/YAP pathway. This pathway is comprised of a kinase cascade that phosphorylates the Yes-associated protein (YAP), preventing it from activating pro-growth/anti-apoptotic TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus. This pathway is frequently disrupted in cancer and several tumors have been shown to be YAP-dependent. The potent antiproliferative phenotype conferred by loss of YAP is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy in NF2-associated cancers. Thus, we propose to investigate the necessity of YAP in NF2-associated schwannoma, identify small molecule inhibitors of the Hippo/YAP pathway, and evaluate their efficacy as anticancer agents against NF2 cancers. We will establish the requirement of YAP for NF2-associated schwannoma, using genetic methods to silence YAP in vitro and in vivo, in a mouse model of NF2-associated schwannoma. We will then identify lead candidates for inhibition of YAP, and other effectors of the Hippo/YAP pathway, using a screening approach based on YAP activation of TEAD-transcriptional activity.

Validated hits will be profiled for selectivity and off-target toxicity. Selected leads will be further developed based on structure-activity relationship and mechanism of action studies.

The goal of this application is to identify whether CSCs exist in MPNSTs. We will track putative CSCs in vivo in the undisturbed tumors from SKP-MPNST autograft model. We will perform a 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU)- label - retaining assay as a first step to investigate the existence of CSCs in MPNST, by taking advantage of the slow-cycling nature of CSCs. To address whether MPNST relapse comes from the proliferation of surviving CSCs, genetic mouse models of MPNST will be used for cell-fate mapping the newly dividing cells in tumors post temozolomide treatment by BrdU analog pluse/chase assays.

MPNSTs are resistant to chemotherapy, and the tumors typically regrow after surgical removal. The existence of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) is believed to, at least partially, explain chemotherapy resistance and recurrence in post-therapy MPNST patients. The goal of this application is to identify whether CSCs exist in MPNSTs. We will track putative CSCs in vivo in the undisturbed tumors from SKP-MPNST autograft model. We will perform a 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU)- label - retaining assay as a first step to investigate the existence of CSCs in MPNST, by taking advantage of the slow-cycling nature of CSCs.

Despite intense study, the molecular consequences of NF2-deficiency are not clear; multiple pathways have been reported to be deregulated in NF2-deficient cells, depending on the cell type and context, complicating efforts to develop well-justified targeted therapeutic strategies for NF2-mutant tumors. Merlin, the tumor suppressor encoded by the NF2 gene, is closely related to the ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin). Merlin/ERM proteins function as multifaceted adaptors that assemble protein complexes at the cell cortex, a mesh-like framework of actin and myosin filaments closely apposed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The cortex connects the cell to the external microenvironment and plays a central role in sensing and generating forces that regulate cell organization and behavior. The failure to appropriately sense and respond to mechanical stimuli can disrupt tissue morphogenesis and lead to tumorigenesis. Recent work from our lab has revealed that a critical function of Merlin is to restrict the cortical distribution of Ezrin. Failure to do so yields profound defects in cortical organization and cell behavior. This suggests that the proximal function of Merlin is to organize the mechanical properties of the cell cortex and supports a novel and unifying hypothesis to explain the broad, variable effects of Merlin loss: That the multiple consequences of NF2-deficiency reflect the inability of NF2-/- cells to dynamically and appropriately organize the cell cortex. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the pathways and behaviors that are regulated by Merlin are themselves modified by changes in the mechanical environment. The central goal of this proposal is to examine the impact of the mechanical environment on three different Merlin activities, namely: 1) Regulation of EGFR endocytosis; 2) Control of signaling through the Hippo/Yap pathway; and 3) Regulation of centrosome clustering - all of which are known to be modified by mechanical stimuli. We will use innovative bioengineering approaches to examine the sensitivity of these pathways to mechanical stimuli in the presence and absence of Merlin. These studies will set the stage for future efforts that match the appropriate therapeutic strategy to a specific tumor type.","The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is mutated or inactivated in the familial tumor syndrome NF2, which is characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervous system.

Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of NF1 have significantly facilitated our study of the pathogenesis of the disorder as well as preclinical drug screening. Tumorigenesis in NF1 is considered to be arising from elevated levels of Ras-regulated signaling pathways. Therefore, most therapeutic approaches tested to date, have either targeted Ras-regulated signaling pathways or intercellular signaling that also appears to be required for development of neurofibromas. Some novel therapeutic strategies recently have emerged to treat genetic disorders by restoring gene or protein function based on distinct mutation types. Suppression therapy is such a strategy targeting genetic disease caused by nonsense mutations. It utilizes pharmacological agents that suppress translation termination at in-frame premature termination codons to restore translation of a full-length, functional polypeptide. Heretofore, suppression therapy has proved feasibility in many genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but has not been tested in NF1 due to the lack of appropriated animal models. The predominant NF1 models, created by complete deletion of both copies of the Nf1 gene in tumor cells, do not mimic mutations seen in NF1 patients, and therefore preclude testing of therapeutics like suppression therapy.  To address this, we have created two novel NF1 GEM models carrying nonsense mutations at exon 18 and exon 29 respectively by recapitulating human NF1 genetic alterations. We propose in this study that these two novel mouse lines will present similar phenotypes to their human counterparts and further provide suitable systems to assess the ability of nonsense mutation suppressor compounds to restore significant NF1 activity in vivo to rescue the disease phenotype.  As the occurrence of nonsense mutations in NF1 patients is up to 20% of total Nf1 gene mutation types, the knowledge from our proposed study will have important implications for the development of novel treatment for NF1 patients with nonsense mutations.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common tumor syndromes affecting the nervous system due to mutations in Nf1 gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin (a Ras GTPase activating protein).

The Cichowski group has recently shown that the MEK inhibitor PD901 exerts potent therapeutic efficacy in the mouse MPNST model but only when combined with rapamycin (unpublished).

Moreover preliminary preclinical studies suggest that an mTOR kinase inhibitor might be more potent than a raplogue.

Their studies further suggest that combined MNK and MEK suppression exhibit therapeutic synergy in human and mouse MPNST cells in vitro. While often overlooked, XL184 is a potent MNK inhibitor. XL184 also inhibits MET, which is frequently amplified in human and mouse MPNSTs. As such XL184 represents a particularly promising therapeutic compound for MPNSTs.

The Cichowski group has recently discovered that a gene known as SUZ12 is frequently mutated or lost in MPNSTs (unpublished). Notably one copy is always lost in microdeletion patients, as it is present within the microdeletion domain, and the second allele is often lost in tumors from these patients as well. SUZ12 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and is involved with chromatin silencing. Importantly, the Cichowski laboratory has found that BRD4 inhibitors, such as JQ1, counteract the biological effects of SUZ12 lost. Moreover, they have found that MEK and BRD4 inhibitors synergize to kill human and mouse MPNST cells (as they suppress two defective pathways in these tumors). Several companies have developed bromodomain inhibitors, which will enter the clinic within the year.

Furthermore, these models yielded novel bioreagents, including multiple tumor cell lines established from radiation-induced Nf1 mutant tumors.   These cell lines represent multiple types of solid tumors developing nullizygosity for Nf1 and we are interrogating them to identify pathways and genes that cooperate with Nf1 loss to promote tumor growth.  In preliminary studies, we utilized a 94-compound library of established chemotherapeutics and small molecule inhibitors targeting a wide spectrum of known cancer-associated signaling pathways. Initial analysis of a panel of tumor cell lines derived from our murine models revealed heterogeneous profiles of drug sensitivities, suggesting diverse signaling requirements that implicate differential mechanisms of tumor formation cooperating with loss of Nf1.

We are currently defining drug-sensitivity signatures and validating identified candidate drugs via in vitro tumorigenesis assays and signaling pathway phosphoprotein analysis. We aim to define characteristic signaling profile signatures to subtype Nf1 mutant tumors by drug sensitivity for clinical application, enabling selection of appropriately tailored therapies for NF1 mutant tumors. Concurrent with our initial signature profiling, we identified several compounds targeting core growth and survival signaling pathways.  These compounds demonstrate broad efficacy against tumor cell lines, and we propose to extend our therapeutic evaluation to in vivo tumor xenograft models.","Loss of neurofibromin results in upregulated Ras signaling, however the precise mechanisms driving tumor development and progression after NF1 loss remain unclear.

Therefore, identifying novel adjunct therapy that can minimize hearing loss and enhance radiosensitivity is urgently needed. To this end, we have established a VS tumor model that mimics human disease by progressing after IR. Using genetic approach, we inhibited TGF-§ signaling by stable transfection with a soluble TGF-§ receptor II (sT§RII) construct.

The NF2 gene codes for Merlin, a regulatory protein of multiple cellular signal transduction pathways, many of which have been implicated in the development of cancer. Previous studies have indicated that Merlin interacts with CD44 and modulates signaling through c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase, suggesting c-Met is a potential target for therapeutic inhibition in the context of NF2 loss of function. Crizotinib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor kinases including c-Met, ALK, and ROS1, and recent clinical trials have established Crizotinib as a standard therapy for patients with pathologies such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We tested the effects of INC280 (a highly selective Met inhibitor) and Crizotinib on the growth of NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and found that Crizotinib inhibits NF2-associated pathogenesis while INC280 does not, suggesting that the effects of Crizotinib are not mediated through Met. Elucidation of Crizotinib mechanism of action therefore represents a mean to identify critical kinases involved in NF2 pathology. Identification of these kinases will then allow the development of more potent and specific inhibitors.

Mast cell infiltration is a characteristic of neurofibroma. Distinct from most other terminally differentiated blood cells, mast cells express tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit and can be activated by c-Kit ligand stem cell factor (SCF). Therefore, SCF has been considered as a crucial factor in the neurofibroma microenvironment. Although results from previous in vitro experiments suggested that NF1-null neoplastic Schwann cells might be one of the sources of SCF in neurofibroma tissue, other cell types generating SCF and the mechanisms by which SCF and mast cells affect neurofibroma formation in vivo are not clear. In this application, we generated NF1 and SCF conditional double knockout mouse in Schwann cells (PLP-CreERT2;Nf1f/-;Scff/gfp) and propose to decipher its neurofibromagenesis compares to tumorigenic NF1 conditional knockouts. The Scfgfp knock-in displaces endogenous Scf, thus providing a marker to track all the cells expressing SCF within the neurofibroma tumor microenvironment. This new mouse strain will allow us to evaluate the impact of SCF in the microenvironment to neurofibroma development and provide potential therapeutic insight against this complex tumor. In addition, we recently successfully developed a novel in vitro 3D neurofibroma model by constructing a skin raft with NF1 knockout SKPs, fibroblasts, nerves, and mast cells. We will also apply NF1/SCF double knockout SKPs in this in vitro model to elucidate the evolution of neurofibromatogenesis, to define the contributions of mast cells, SCF and other constituents within the microenvironment for neurofibroma development, as well as to examine the efficacy of potential anti-neurofibroma agents. With this new genetically-modified Scf mouse strains, we now have a valuable resource to understand disease pathogenesis by introducing Scf alternations into our established mouse plexiform neurofibroma model, as well as a newly generated in vitro 3D neurofibroma model.

Although results from previous in vitro experiments suggested that NF1-null neoplastic Schwann cells might be one of the sources of SCF in neurofibroma tissue, other cell types generating SCF and the mechanisms by which SCF and mast cells affect neurofibroma formation in vivo are not clear. In this application, we generated NF1 and SCF conditional double knockout mouse in Schwann cells (PLP-CreERT2;Nf1f/-;Scff/gfp) and propose to decipher its neurofibromagenesis compares to tumorigenic NF1 conditional knockouts. The Scfgfp knock-in displaces endogenous Scf, thus providing a marker to track all the cells expressing SCF within the neurofibroma tumor microenvironment. This new mouse strain will allow us to evaluate the impact of SCF in the microenvironment to neurofibroma development and provide potential therapeutic insight against this complex tumor. In addition, we recently successfully developed a novel in vitro 3D neurofibroma model by constructing a skin raft with NF1 knockout SKPs, fibroblasts, nerves, and mast cells. We will also apply NF1/SCF double knockout SKPs in this in vitro model to elucidate the evolution of neurofibromatogenesis, to define the contributions of mast cells, SCF and other constituents within the microenvironment for neurofibroma development, as well as to examine the efficacy of potential anti-neurofibroma agents. With this new genetically-modified Scf mouse strains, we now have a valuable resource to understand disease pathogenesis by introducing Scf alternations into our established mouse plexiform neurofibroma model, as well as a newly generated in vitro 3D neurofibroma model. These experiments will allow us to further elucidate the role of SCF/c-Kit signaling in neurofibroma and may provide insights on viable therapeutic targets for neurofibromas.",105500,USD,105500,2014-07-31,2014,2016-07-30,2016,Liao Chung-Ping,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,grid.267313.2,Dallas,Texas,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477734,1107 Immunology,1107 Immunology,,,,,Stem Cell Research; Neurosciences; Cancer; Rare Diseases; Pediatric; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Neurofibromatosis,Stem Cell Research,Neurosciences,Cancer,Rare Diseases,Pediatric,,,,,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,Plexiform neurofibroma; Schwannoma - Final; Plexiform neurofibroma - Final; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; NF1 plexiform; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),Plexiform neurofibroma,Schwannoma - Final,Plexiform neurofibroma - Final,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 2 - Aetiology; Oncology 1 Glioblastoma; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 2 - Aetiology,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,100,grant.5477894,2014-01-007,Altered Critical Period for Ocular Dominance Plasticity in heterozygous NF1 Mutant Mice,Altered Critical Period for Ocular Dominance Plasticity in heterozygous NF1 Mutant Mice,"During postnatal development we learn and gain experiences, such as a new language, social interactions and motor skills. At a young age it is easier to learn. During that time there are critical periods, or time windows, when parts of the brain are very susceptible to changes and show high levels of plasticity. The timing of these critical periods is very important. Early closure might result in deficits later in life as the learning process is not yet finished. A high percentage of NF1 patients (30-50%) show learning disabilities and neurocognitive impairments. This might be caused by changes in plasticity levels. However, we hypothesize that these learning deficits are partially caused by altered regulation of critical periods. A well known model we use to study critical period and cortical plasticity is binocular vision in mice, or learning to see with two eyes. The start and closure of the critical period is regulated by inhibitory GABAergic signaling. Enhancement of GABAergic transmission can cause an early critical period, while a reduction results in delayed closure of the critical period. In NF1 there is increased inhibition and our preliminary data strongly suggest early closure of the critical period. We plan to use heterozygous NF1 knockout mice to study the timing of ocular dominance critical periods in NF1 mice. Additionally, we propose a new therapeutic approach by inducing a delay in closure of the critical period and increase plasticity, by reducing inhibition. We have shown that in adult mice loss of inhibitory synapses is very important for cortical plasticity. Additionally, we have preliminary data that show when pharmacologically decreasing inhibition, plasticity levels can again be increased. Plasticity levels can also be increased by environmental enrichment. If indeed developmental deficits in NF1 mice can be rescued at an early age by delaying critical period closure, this will have profound consequences for therapeutic approaches to treat NF1. If the cognitive deficits in NF1 are caused by altered regulation of critical periods, therapeutic strategies must focus on regulation of critical periods much earlier in development.","During postnatal development we learn and gain experiences, such as a new language, social interactions and motor skills.

Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 have a NF1+/- genotype. However, the tumors that these patients have are frequently NF1-/-. The NF1 protein negatively regulates the Ras pathway. NF1 loss results in Ras hyperactivation, which subsequently has been shown to drive the formation of MPNSTs.Our lab performed a screen to identify compounds that may target tumors with NF1 loss or deficiency. We screened yeast with an IRA2 deletion (a yeast homologue of mammalian NF1) and discovered 108 compounds that were selective for ira2? yeast.

We have determined that UC1 inhibits RNA Pol II via a CDK9 dependent mechanism. CDK9 regulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA Pol II. We discovered that deletion of yeast CDK9 was synthetically lethal with deletion of yeast NF1. We hypothesize that inhibition of Cdk9 will selectively target NF1-deficient tumors.

A recent study found that an active form of Merlin recruits the core kinase Warts to the plasma membrane to activate it. In addition, Merlin has also been implicated in AJs establishment in conjunction with Par-3. Together these studies suggest functional interactions between the apical polarity proteins and Merlin in regulating the Hippo pathway at the AJR. In this proposal, I will investigate how apical polarity proteins and Merlin interact and how they regulate the Hippo pathway with genetic, cell biological, and biochemical tools. I will focus on addressing the following questions: 1) What is the functional significance of AJR localization for Merlin and other Hippo pathway components? Specifically, I plan to test the hypothesis that Hippo pathway components form a signaling complex at the AJR and that its function involves association with endosomes mediated by Merlin, and 2) do apical polarity proteins directly regulate Hippo pathway functions and if so, what are the potential mechanisms? The proposed work will provide novel molecular insights into how Merlin functions as a tumor suppressor protein in both flies and in humans.",64000,USD,64000,2014-07-31,2014,2016-07-30,2016,Xu Jiajie,University of Chicago,University of Chicago,grid.170205.1,Chicago,Illinois,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477711,0604 Genetics; 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,0604 Genetics,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,,,Genetics; Rare Diseases; Neurosciences,Genetics,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,,,Generic Health Relevance,Generic Health Relevance,,,,,1.1 Normal biological development and functioning,1.1 Normal biological development and functioning,,,,,Biomedical,Basic Science,,,,,,,Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neuro (general) -Draft; Neurofibromatosis type 2 - Final,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),Neuro (general) -Draft,Neurofibromatosis type 2 - Final,,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC; RAC 1 - Underpinning; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC Basic (1+2) for WDC,RAC 1 - Underpinning,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,,100,grant.5477774,2014-02-001,Schwannomatosis genomes,Schwannomatosis genomes,"Schwannomas are the hallmark tumour in both schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), although NF2 is characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and both cutaneous and non-cutaneous schwannomas, while schwannomatosis is characterized by non-vestibular, non-intradermal schwannomas.

Relevant metadata describing cell lines and treatments will be captured and standardized in a Synapse database accessible through both the Synapse web portal and programmatic APIs. Raw dose-response data will be available along with computed variables such as IC50s.
Deliverable 2: Curate and host raw and processed omics data in Synapse. Sage Bionetworks bioinformatics scientists will co-develop an analysis pipeline with the Gusella and Novartis labs for the analysis of RNAseq and exome sequencing data. Data, code, and processed results files will be distributed to the consortium through Synapse, and the analysis
tracked by the Synapse provenance system.
Deliverable 3: Create a Synapse project serving as data and knowledge sharing hub for the consortium. Sage will create a private Synapse project hosted on Synapse which will serve as an online collaborative portal for all consortium activities. Sage will provide training and technical support to all consortium members on Synapse over the term of the grant. As resources are ready to be made public, Sage will assist with configuring Synapse to place appropriate sections of the portal into the public domain. Sage will also continue to develop Synapse capabilities for the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and commentary, not just data. The Synodos consortium will be included in the design and beta-testing of these new platform features.
Deliverable 4: Provide embedded tools in Synapse for common analyses and visualization of Synodos data. Sage will survey researchers who are part of the Synodos consortium to identify common needs in accessing and understanding the data sets hosted in Synapse. Sage will then create tools and interactive visualizations to enhance the accessibility and transparency of the consortiumÕs data. An example of such a tool might be an interactive visualization of the distribution of molecular traits (e.g. mutations), allowing a user to drill down into the specific samples harboring these traits. Another example could include a dashboard of differentially expressed pathways run automatically across multiple phenotypes. While we cannot hope to address (or anticipate) all use-cases of the data, we expect that there are common questions among the Synodos consortia members that can be addressed in a systematic and global manner.
Deliverable 5: Extend the Synapse platform to promote greater visibility of individual contributions and capabilities to the consortium. We view developing a compelling Òsocial layerÓ to Synapse a key aspect in leveraging technology to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of scientific work, as it is this layer that taps into individual incentives around recognition and career progression.

The program teaches coping skills that have already been shown to improve quality of life and ability to deal with stress and symptoms in various other medical conditions. People with NF may experience depression, anxiety, stress, lower self-esteem, and pain. For adolescents, these issues are added to the usual stresses of adolescence. Psychological approaches such as relaxation exercises and cognitive therapies are potentially very helpful for these problems, but not everyone has convenient access to therapists trained in these mind-body techniques. For this reason, Dr. Vranceanu and colleagues are testing delivering these services via Skype. Her current CRA builds on a CTF Clinical Research Award to study 3RP with adults with NF1 or NF2, which she is completing under a 2013 grant.

A high throughput drug screen recently revealed that simultaneous inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL1 is a potential treatment strategy for particular KRAS-driven cancers (Faber et al. 2014). Specifically, the BCL2/XL inhibitor ABT-263 in combination with a TORC1/2 inhibitor (MCL1 protein down-regulation) has selective activity in KRAS mutant colorectal cancers but not in non-small cell lung cancer. Most probably this can be explained by the different regulation of MCL1 expression in both KRAS mutant cancers. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is caused by germline mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which generally result in decreased intracellular neurofibromin protein levels, leading to increased cascade Ras signaling to its downstream effectors. Multiple key pathways are involved with the development of tumors in NF1, including Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The NFTC groups have shown that these NF1-deficient tumors are dependent on mTOR signaling. Our goal is to evaluate whether mTOR-regulated MCL1 expression is a relevant survival mechanism in NF1-deficient tumors and test the sensitivity of NF1-deficient tumor models to ABT-263 initially at MTD as a single agent.
In 2014, we ran a full trial with AKT inhibitor MK2206, both alone and in combination with a MEK inhibitor, which caused a rapid and sustained improvement of hematological parameters in Kras and Nf1 mutant mice. The reasons for testing a second AKT inhibitor are two fold. First, we would like to inform preclinial trials and translation to the clinic as the GSK MEK inhibitor is currently the only FDA-approved MEK inhibitor and future combination trials will likely involve the GSK AKT inhibitor rather than MK2206. Second, we are seeking to evaluate the utility and feasability of shorter trials that would allow for higher throughput of different compounds. Currently, our MTD trials typically take about 6 weeks, while our efficacy trials take 8 weeks or longer. This set-up precludes evaluating multiple agents per year. We would like the test the feasbility and utility of running shorter pilot trials in the Kras mice only. In our prior preclinical studies in the Kras mice, compound efficacy could be predicted at the two week mark by evaluating white blood cell count and anemia.

It is known that activated JAKs can phosphorylate tyrosines on their associated receptors, including SHP-2 and Shc, which recruit the GRB2 adapter and stimulate the Ras cascade. JAK/STAT signaling also indirectly promotes Ras signaling through the transcriptional activation of SOCS3. SOCS3 binds RasGAP, a negative regulator of Ras signaling, and reduces its activity, thereby promoting activation of the Ras pathway. Reciprocally, RTK pathway activity promotes JAK/STAT signaling by at least two mechanisms. First, the activation of some RTKs, including EGFR and PDGFR, results in the JAK-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, probably by the Src kinase. Second, RTK/Ras pathway stimulation causes the downstream activation of MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of most STATs, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activation by STAT. And finally, in addition to RTK and PI3K interactions with JAK/STAT signaling, multiple levels of cross-talk with the TGF-? signaling pathway have also been reported. The Ratner lab has had very promising results using the ISIS/Astrazeneca Stat 3 antisense RNA as a single agent in their system. They will further these studies by targeting both the Jak/Stat pathway and RTK pathways simultaneously using both a Stat3 and MEK inhibitor in their system.

Additionally, using their JMML model, the Shannon group has shown that inhibition of AKT (using MK2206) specifically results in reduction of WBC counts in NF1 null leukemias. Simultaneously inhibiting multiple pathways downstream of k-Ras (like MEK and AKT) is an attractive approach to treating plexiform neurofibromas. The Clapp group will test AZD5363 as both a single agent and in combination with AZD 6244.

The Clapp lab has proven in previous milestones that selumetinib is effective in reducing plexiform neurofibroma number and size even at reduced dosages. Pharmacokinetic analysis even in the mice shows a short half-life of the drug (approximately 2 hours) that favors twice a day dosing in children. Clinical experiences noted by Dr. Widemann have noted difficulty with families administering BID dosing continuously. Results from Dr. ClappÕs lab have shown some efficacy of reduced dosing in GEMMs. Alternate dose schedules have not been examined and could lead to better compliance, less toxicity, and longer treatment duration for patients.

Treatment will be continued for 12 weeks or until death. Mice on trial will be monitored with physical exams to evaluate disease progression.

In conjunction with the ChildrenÕs Tumor Foundation NF Preclinical Consortium, our group has a great deal of experience with MEK inhibitors, having tested CI-1040, PD 0325901 and trametinib (GSK1120212) all of which showed some degree of efficacy in NF1 deficient model systems. Due to the current phase I trial with selumetinib (AZD6244) in NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas, we sought to examine the efficacy of lowering the dose of selumetinib in our GEMM in order to utilize this compound in combination with inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt- mTor pathway. To our surprise seen in Figure 1, doses at as low as 20% of the MTD (25mg/kg/BID) seemed to have similar efficacy in our GEMM. In comparing doses with what was determined to be the MTD in humans from the clinical phase I study, we chose to examine the 10mg/kg BID dose (equivalent to human dose) in combination with AZD2014. Due to the efficacy of this dose in both the mice and humans, we propose to further evaluate this dosage in varying schedules that may offer less toxicity and create better compliance with long-term chronic therapy required to treat this lifelong disease.","Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is caused by germline mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which generally result in decreased intracellular neurofibromin protein levels, leading to increased cascade Ras signaling to its downstream effectors.

Due to the efficacy of this dose in both the mice and humans, we propose to further evaluate this dosage in varying schedules that may offer less toxicity and create better compliance with long-term chronic therapy required to treat this lifelong disease.",268396,USD,268396,2014-07-15,2014,2015-07-15,2015,Wade Clapp,Indiana University,Indiana University Ð Purdue University Indianapolis,grid.257413.6,Indianapolis,Indiana,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5477797,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,,,,,Rare Diseases; Neurosciences; Cancer; Pediatric; Orphan Drug; Neurofibromatosis,Rare Diseases,Neurosciences,Cancer,Pediatric,Orphan Drug,Cancer,Cancer,,,,,6.1 Pharmaceuticals; 5.1 Pharmaceuticals,6.1 Pharmaceuticals,5.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,,Biomedical,Clinical Medicine and Science,,,,,,,Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia; Plexiform neurofibroma; NF1 JMML; Plexiform neurofibroma - Final; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; NF1 plexiform; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,Plexiform neurofibroma,NF1 JMML,Plexiform neurofibroma - Final,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),RAC 5 - Treatment Development; RAC 6 - Treatment Evaluation; Oncology 1 Glioblastoma; JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,RAC 5 - Treatment Development,RAC 6 - Treatment Evaluation,Oncology 1 Glioblastoma,JakÐSTAT signaling in the immune system,100,grant.5477858,2014-17-005,NFTC 2014 preclinical testing of repourposed compounds in MPNST animal model,NFTC 2014 preclinical testing of repourposed compounds in MPNST animal model,"The Cichowski lab has demonstrated that HSP90 inhibitors, when combined with mTOR inhibitors, induce dramatic regression of aggressive NF1- and RAS-driven tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (De Raedt et al, 2011). These studies served as the basis for two clinical trials evaluating the effects of Hsp90 and mTOR inhibitors in patients with MPNSTs and non-small cell lung cancer. However, the success of these trials may depend not only on inhibiting these critical targets, but achieving a non-toxic dose of these combined agents. Therefore to expand upon this therapeutic strategy, we have been seeking out other agents that inhibit HSP90. Hsp90 is subject to an array of posttranslational modifications that regulate its function, including acetylation, which inhibits its catalytic activity (Scroggins et al. 2007). Reversible acetylation of Hsp90 is controlled by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Accordingly, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to induce Hsp90 hyperacetylation and suppress its activity. HDAC inhibitors have undergone rapid clinical development in recent years, with vorinostat and romidepsin currently being the most extensively studied compounds. Our goal is to test the FDA-approved pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat as an alternative mechanism to inhibit Hsp90 activity (in combination with mTORC1 inhibition) in our genetically engineered mouse model of MPNSTs.

Evasion of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). As such, targeting the regulation and function of pro-survival BCL-2 family members (e.g BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1) may provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer. Several BH3 mimetics, which bind to and inhibit pro-survival members of the BCL-2 family, have been described. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of BH3 mimetics for NF1-deficient cancers we performed an in vitro screen using ABT-199 (BCL-2 inhibitor), ABT-263 (BCL-2 and BCL-XL inhibitor) and obatoclax (BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 inhibitor) in 2 human MPNST cell lines. While no or little sensitivity was observed with ABT-199 and ABT-263 as a single agent, obatoclax showed significant reduction in cell viability. However, obatoclax has significant (likely off-target) toxicity in patients, potentially limiting its ultimate utility (Schimmer et al. 2010). Therefore, we also evaluated these agents in combination with either the MEK inhibitor PD901 or the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Notably, in this screen ABT-263 +rapamycin also promoted potent MPNST cell death. Therefore, in this study we seek to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of ABT-263/rapamycin in our MPNST mouse model.

Current clinical strategies often combine targeted therapies with immune therapies, in part because the cell death induced by the targeted therapy has been hypothesized to enhance antigen exposure and the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore we will evaluate anti-PD1 antibodies with single and combined inhibition of MEK (PD-0325901) and BRD4 (JQ1). We believe this particular combination therapy has the highest chance of success because MEK inhibition together with BRD4 inhibition potently induces cell death in MPNSTs and is well tolerated (De Raedt et al, in press). Moreover, treatment of human MPNST cells either with JQ1 or PD-0325901 downregulates the expression of CD274, the gene encoding PDL1, 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively (unpublished data). Hence, our hypothesis is that the triple combination therapy will stimulate the immune response by inhibiting receptors both on the tumor cell and T-cells, which could prove to be more successful than either therapy alone. Because the triple combination therapy is most likely to be successful, we will begin by evaluating the combination of anti-PD1, PD-901 and JQ1 for toxicity in tumor-bearing mice.","The Cichowski lab has demonstrated that HSP90 inhibitors, when combined with mTOR inhibitors, induce dramatic regression of aggressive NF1- and RAS-driven tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (De Raedt et al, 2011).

Since many tumor cells with amplified centrosomes can cluster them and still form a bipolar spindle, one key strategy has been to identify drugs that uncluster centrosomes leading to mitotic arrest or catastrophe. We recently found that a key function of Merlin is to promote centrosome clustering by restricting the distribution of Ezrin at the cell cortex (Hebert et al., 2012). Thus loss of Merlin promotes centrosome unclustering and multipolar spindle formation in many types of tumor cells that harbor amplified but clustered centrosomes. Moreover, we have now identified high frequencies of centrosome amplification and unclustering in all NF2-associated tumors that we have tested, including mesothelioma, meningioma, renal carcinoma and schwannoma. Importantly, however, many if not most NF2-deficient cells are able to recover and re-cluster their centrosomes to avoid mitotic catastrophe. Thus NF2-deficient cells are likely to be poised to undergo mitotic catastrophe in response to the compounded pharmacologic disruption of centrosome clustering, an idea supported by pilot studies. Remarkably, we most recently found that acute inactivation of Merlin in primary Schwann cells leads to rapid centrosome amplification and unclustering, highlighting the direct role for Merlin function in centrosome biology and suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for schwannoma.

In the setting of radiation we will investigate these compounds for enhanced or decreased toxicity and efficacy, in addition to evaluating for secondary malignancies, in this mouse model.

The discrepancy between current estimates of the incidence of schwannomatosis and the much lower number of patients seen at dedicated neurofibromatosis (NF) clinics suggests that a significant proportion of patients are suffering from delayed diagnosis. Diagnostic delay can have significant adverse effects on patients because of psychological distress, distrust of medical care providers, inappropriate care management planning, and lack of appropriate genetic counseling.
Specific Aims: We will generate a comprehensive process map that describes the events leading to a diagnosis of schwannomatosis and referral to dedicated NF clinics. We will identify patient-, provider-, and system level barriers to prompt diagnosis of schwannomatosis and explore the impact of delayed diagnosis on patients. Finally, we will develop and administer a survey that can assess the extent of and reasons for diagnostic delay in a large, representative sample of schwannomatosis patients.
Study Design: We will use a health services research approach to analyzing schwannomatosis patientsÕ pathways through the healthcare system, using process mapping, qualitative analysis, and quantitative surveys. First, we will conduct a comprehensive medical record review of all patients (>100) with definite or probable schwannomatosis seen at the NF specialty clinics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2002-2014. We will use quantitative analysis to assess recurrent factors in the diagnostic journey, including early schwannomatosis-related symptoms commonly missed by providers, and the types of providers who see patients with schwannomatosis earliest in their care. We will use process mapping to chart the step-by-step journey of schwannomatosis patients to delineate current care pathways and identify potentially modifiable barriers to accurate diagnosis.
Second, we will conduct approximately 21 interviews with U.S. patients selected from the International Schwannomatosis Database, the largest schwannomatosis patient registry in the world. We will use stratified purposeful sampling to select the most recently diagnosed patients within each ISD partner site. We will use grounded thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify additional barriers to diagnosis and take advantage of patientsÕ unique viewpoints on patient, provider, and system level processes. Interviews will serve to contextualize and expand findings from the medical records, illuminating the impact of delayed diagnosis on patientsÕ current orientation to their medical team.
Third, using established health services theoretical frameworks and the results from our convergent analysis of medical records and patient interviews, we will develop a survey on diagnostic delay and provision of medical care. Survey items from existing assessments of cancer diagnostic delay will be reviewed and modified as needed to cover all emergent themes from We will then pilot test the surveys with a small sample of patients at MGH, using cognitive interviewing techniques to ensure patient understanding of the questions. Finally, we will administer this survey online to an international sample of schwannomatosis patients, using the ISD and CTF NF registry as our primary recruitment tools.
Through this comprehensive, mixed-methods approach, we will identify the highest-impact points for interventions to decrease diagnostic delay and improve patientsÕ experiences.","Background: Our prior work in schwannomatosis has shown that patients with schwannomatosis experience significant delays in diagnosis, with a median delay from first symptom to diagnosis of 7 years.

Diagnostic delay can have significant adverse effects on patients because of psychological distress, distrust of medical care providers, inappropriate care management planning, and lack of appropriate genetic counseling.
Specific Aims: We will generate a comprehensive process map that describes the events leading to a diagnosis of schwannomatosis and referral to dedicated NF clinics. We will identify patient-, provider-, and system level barriers to prompt diagnosis of schwannomatosis and explore the impact of delayed diagnosis on patients. Finally, we will develop and administer a survey that can assess the extent of and reasons for diagnostic delay in a large, representative sample of schwannomatosis patients.
Study Design: We will use a health services research approach to analyzing schwannomatosis patientsÕ pathways through the healthcare system, using process mapping, qualitative analysis, and quantitative surveys. First, we will conduct a comprehensive medical record review of all patients (>100) with definite or probable schwannomatosis seen at the NF specialty clinics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2002-2014. We will use quantitative analysis to assess recurrent factors in the diagnostic journey, including early schwannomatosis-related symptoms commonly missed by providers, and the types of providers who see patients with schwannomatosis earliest in their care. We will use process mapping to chart the step-by-step journey of schwannomatosis patients to delineate current care pathways and identify potentially modifiable barriers to accurate diagnosis.
Second, we will conduct approximately 21 interviews with U.S. patients selected from the International Schwannomatosis Database, the largest schwannomatosis patient registry in the world. We will use stratified purposeful sampling to select the most recently diagnosed patients within each ISD partner site. We will use grounded thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify additional barriers to diagnosis and take advantage of patientsÕ unique viewpoints on patient, provider, and system level processes. Interviews will serve to contextualize and expand findings from the medical records, illuminating the impact of delayed diagnosis on patientsÕ current orientation to their medical team.
Third, using established health services theoretical frameworks and the results from our convergent analysis of medical records and patient interviews, we will develop a survey on diagnostic delay and provision of medical care. Survey items from existing assessments of cancer diagnostic delay will be reviewed and modified as needed to cover all emergent themes from We will then pilot test the surveys with a small sample of patients at MGH, using cognitive interviewing techniques to ensure patient understanding of the questions. Finally, we will administer this survey online to an international sample of schwannomatosis patients, using the ISD and CTF NF registry as our primary recruitment tools.

Symptomatic manifestation of this disease encompasses two distinct domains. The somatic aspects include formation of benign and malignant tumors of the nervous system and are associated with the abnormal proliferation and cellular differentiation. In
addition, NF1 patients suffer from prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms that include cognitive impairments, motor discoordination, attention and social difficulties and idiopathic pain. The mechanisms behind these manifestations are not well understood and need to be uncovered with the hope of improving patient?s quality of life through targeted interventions. Towards this goal, this
proposal is focused on understanding the role of NF1 protein in the nervous system. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin protein that serves as a negative regulator of Ras by a virtue of its GAP domain which is thought to be responsible for most of the biological activity of NF1. We have recently discovered that the GAP activity of NF1 protein towards Ras is potently inhibited by direct binding to G protein ?? subunits that are released upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Genetic experiments in knockout mice indicated that NF1 is largely responsible for GPCR coupling to Ras signaling in the nervous system and that dysregulation of this signaling is responsible for motor learning and pain issues in the mouse model of NF1. Considering this newly discovered phenomenon with a previous wealth of documentation on GPCRs, we aim to discover:
(i) How G protein ?? subunits that are released upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) bind to NF1 inhibiting its GAP activity towards Ras? From our preliminary data on direct interaction of G?? with Sec14/PH module of NF1 which is located
next to the catalytic GAP domain and inhibition of GAP activity of NF1 by G??, we hypothesize that large conformational changes occur in the GRD-Sec14-PH module and the residues of GRD domain interacting with Ras are masked by G??. Interestingly, many pathogenic mutations in human patients with neurofibromatosis have been mapped to Sec14-PH domain. Thus, we further hypothesize that these mutations affect the ability of G?? to regulate NF1 activity providing mechanistic basis for their
pathological effects. We will solve the structure of the NF1-G?? complex and evaluate the role of residues involved in the interaction and basis of inhibition of GAP activity. Our structure-guided mutagenesis will provide the effects of each residues on GAP activity and ultimately the physiological consequences.
(ii) What are the regulatory principles of GPCR-induced G??-NF1 interaction and what are its effects on signaling pathways controlled by NF1? Several studies indicate that cAMP and MAPK signaling systems are essential for learning and
memory, motor coordination and are implicated in chronic pain. Both cAMP and MAPK pathways are commonly activated by the GPCRs. Our preliminary data shows that NF1 is a binding partner of G?? subunits which are released upon activation of GPCRs. Furthermore, we found that activation of GPCR can dynamically regulate association between G?? and NF1. This suggest that GPCRs transduce their signals to MAPK pathway activation at least in part through NF1. To test this hypothesis, we will study the effects of Sec14-PH/GRD-Sec14-PH on Ras/MAPK signaling by measuring GAP activity using recombinant proteins in vitro and optical sensors in live cells (HEK293 cells). We will assess the consequences of transfer of GPCR signal via NF1 pathogenic mutants through a new version of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay. We hypothesize that loss of G?? interaction with NF1 will subsequently affects downstream signaling in the key neuronal pathways which are responsible for development of prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms. Collectively, the role of NF1 (SEC-PH module) patient mutation can be linked to GPCR signaling pathways. This may open a new arena exploiting the use of GPCR-targeted therapeutics for the
treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in NF1 patients.","Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss-offunction mutations in the NF1 gene.

This genetic disease is caused by loss of function mutations in the Nf1 gene. A growing number of reports highlighted a decreased quality of life for NF1 patients because enhanced pain sensitivity and higher migraine incidence. These reports suggest that loss of neurofibromin expression or activity may predispose individuals to migraine. In a mouse model of neurofibromatosis (Nf1+/? mice), increased sodium and calcium currents were found in sensory neurons. This was correlated with an increased stimulus-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, neuropeptide responsible for a migraine attack). Previous work in the mentorÕs lab described that sensory neurons from Nf1+/? mice exhibited increased N-type Ca2+ channel (CaV2.2) currents and this likely contributed to the increased release of CGRP that occurred in Nf1+/? sensory neurons.  Among the regulatory proteins of the N-type Ca2+ channel, the Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 (CRMP2) was found to interact with neurofibromin. During neuronal differentiation, the neurofibromin/CRMP2 interaction inhibits CRMP2 phosphorylation which is a key regulatory event regulating its function to promote CaV2.2 activity. I hypothesized that in neurofibromatosis, the loss of neurofibromin results in an increased CRMP2 phosphorylation, increased CaV2.2 activity and increased CGRP release. Thus, in NF1 patients, the high migraine prevalence could be due to the loss of negative regulation of neurofibromin over CRMP2 phosphorylation, resulting in hyperexcitability of the sensory neurons responsible for migraine.  Here, I propose two novel approaches to reverse CRMP2 phosphorylation level to that of the non-NF1 population. (i) The use of a neurofibromin derived peptide (TAT-NCIP) to mimic the neurofibromin/CRMP2 interaction consequently inhibiting CRMP2 phosphorylation and (ii) repurposing an enantiomer of a FDA approved anti-epileptic drug, (S)-Lacosamide ((S)-LCM), that was found to inhibit CRMP2 phosphorylation. Inhibiting CRMP2 phosphorylation will result in a reversal of CaV2.2 activity and CGRP release to that of nonNF1 people. First, I will determine the optimal concentrations of TAT-NCIP and (S)-LCM to block CRMP2 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Second I will investigate TAT-NCIP and (S)-LCM efficiency to alter CaV2.2 activity and trafficking in sensory neurons. Finally, I will use TAT-NCIP and (S)-LCM to modulate evoked release of neuropeptide transmitters (CGRP) from sensory neurons in Nf1+/- mice and their effect on nociception in a rodent model of migraine. These results will provide the proof of concept that modulating CRMP2 phosphorylation using either a neurofibromin derived peptide (TAT-NCIP) or (S)-Lacosamide in neurofibromatosis, is an efficient strategy to prevent migraine attacks.

Interestingly, elevated ERK/MAPK activities are now known to be causative to a large number of human neurodevelopmental syndromes. Collectively, these syndromes are referred to as RASopathies. RASopathy patients commonly exhibit brain growth alterations, neurodevelopmental delay, learning deficits, motor dysfunction, and high prevalence of autism and seizures. However, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurological phenotypes in NF-1 and other RASopathies are largely unknown. Although the effects of NF1 loss of function have been investigated in both neural progenitor cells and in mature neurons, little is known about NF1 regulation of neuronal circuit formation and behavioral abnormalities that may result from circuit malformation.
Human and NF-1 mouse model studies have suggested that deficits of fine motor control in NF-1 originate from cortical areas, where layer V neurons (upper motor neurons) form long-range projections innervating spinal neurons to execute fine motor control. In addition, both postmortem brain histological study and human genetics study suggest malfunction of layer V neurons as a major contributor to the development of autism, a feature prevalent in NF-1 and RASopathies. I have obtained preliminary results demonstrating that the development of layer V neurons and formation of axonal projections are especially sensitive to ERK/MAPK activities.

Because mature osteoblasts are necessary for bone formation and fracture healing, this defects is thought to explain the recalcitrant bone healing (pseudarthrosis) observed in some children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
The goal of this proposal is to determine if ectopic activation of EGFR signaling in Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitor cells is the cause of their impaired differentiation. In addition, we plan to investigate the potential of EGFR signaling inhibitors as therapies for NF1 pseudarthrosis (PA). This research direction is based on our preliminary data showing that mice lacking Nf1 in osteoprogenitors exhibit tibial non-union and develop an atrophic callus similar to children with NF1 after fracture of their dysplatic tibia. It is also based on the observation that biopsies from the pseudoarthrotic site of NF1 patients have increased Epiregulin (one member of EGF family) and EGFR expression, which I have confirmed in our in vitro Nf1-/- mouse model. The goal of my first aim is to determine whether inhibition of EGFR signaling in Nf1-/- ostoprogenitors (which ectopically express epiregulin and EGFR) corrects their impaired differentiation, thereby potentially identifying EGFR signaling as a novel therapeutic target to promote bone healing in NF1. My second aim will assess the therapeutic potential of an EGFR inhibitor released topically at the fracture site via nanoparticles in the inducible PrxERT; Nf1f/f mouse model of NF1 PA.

this proposal will validate EGFR as a novel therapeutic target of NF1 PA.","Previous studies in our laboratory and others have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells lacking Nf1 have a limited capacity to differentiate towards osteoblasts. Because mature osteoblasts are necessary for bone formation and fracture healing, this defects is thought to explain the recalcitrant bone healing (pseudarthrosis) observed in some children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
The goal of this proposal is to determine if ectopic activation of EGFR signaling in Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitor cells is the cause of their impaired differentiation. In addition, we plan to investigate the potential of EGFR signaling inhibitors as therapies for NF1 pseudarthrosis (PA). This research direction is based on our preliminary data showing that mice lacking Nf1 in osteoprogenitors exhibit tibial non-union and develop an atrophic callus similar to children with NF1 after fracture of their dysplatic tibia.

Roadblocks:
While we have had great success thus far in enrolling 400 schwannomatosis patients, we have encountered some roadblocks to the ISDÕs success. We have surveyed the ISD collaborators, enrollment sites, and researches as to these roadblocks. 
Roadblocks to enrollment: The enrollment sites have responded: 1.) Not enough staff/time to upload patient information, 2). IRB issues at the enrollment site 3). too few patients.
While the ISD Central Study Office cannot resolve staff, IRB, and patient numbers at individual sites, overall enrollment can be increased by recruiting additional enrollment sites and promoting/streamlining self enrollment. 
Roadblocks to submitting an LOI: Lack of research funds, lack of staff, other work (clinical duties or other established projects), LOI process is unclear.

The most common primary CNS tumors are gliomas that usually involve the optic pathways especially in children. In this regard, bilateral optic gliomas are nearly pathognomonic for NF1 (1). On pathologic examination, most are pilocytic astrocytomas, World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I. However, patients with NF1 may also develop diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas (WHO grades II-IV), particularly with an onset later in life (1). Although the predisposition for CNS tumor development in patients with NF1 is well recognized, and there are numerous studies focusing on the clinical features, the molecular features of gliomas occurring in patients with NF1 have remained obscure. Thus, the development of targeted therapeutic approaches that have provided successful examples of personalized treatment in other sporadic cancer types cannot be developed against gliomas occurring in patients affected by NF1. The aim of this proposal is to identify the landscape of genetic and epigenetic alterations occurring in gliomas from NF1 patients, extract the driver alterations, model them in vitro and in vivo systems and develop targeted therapies against the key addicting events occurring in gliomas from NF1 patients.  In the first part of this project, we will analyze gliomas occurring in patients with NF1 using the comprehensive molecular characterization of tumors typically performed in the context of TCGA Analysis Working Groups dedicated towards a specific tumor type. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively identify the genomic and molecular features of these tumors and compare them with those arising sporadically. We are in a unique position to succeed since we have generated many computational platforms that can extract bona-fide cancer drivers of the disease from a comprehensive analysis of the tumors using all the possible platforms (exome sequencing, RNA-seq, SNP arrays and so on). Furthermore, we have recently reported the identification of the landscape of the driver alterations in GBM and we are in the process of reporting similar genetic landscapes in grade II and III lower grade glioma (2, 3). Therefore, we have already available the baseline dataset derived from sporadic glioma with which to compare the results derived from NF1-derived glioma. Using adult and pediatric brain tumors as cancer models, we will build upon the extensive expertise of our team in brain tumors and the availability of multiple genomic platforms in the TCGA matrix for sporadic LGG and GBM. Our group has assembled unique computational and experimental tools to identify and dissect the functional and ÒtargetableÓ significance of novel, key genetic alterations in human glioma. In particular, we have recently inspected the GBM genome for somatic mutations and functional gene fusions, two types of oncogenic alterations that generate tumor addiction in other tumors, and in some cases have been successfully targeted by specific inhibitors (2, 3). Once the full landscape of the genomic and epigenomic alterations in gliomas from NF1 patients is identified, we will focus on the identification of the driver alterations that are essential for tumor maintenance. To identify key tumor driver units, we will integrate algorithms for the identification of somatic copy number variations, (CNVs, ComFocal) with new algorithms for the identification of somatic variants (mutations and gene fusions), using whole exome and transcriptome deep sequencing data (SAVI, ExomeFUSE and Tx-FUSE, respectively). Then, new combinatorial algorithms will be used to identify synergistic or exclusive somatic lesions. To accurately mimic the exclusivity or cooccurrence of the alterations detected in the human tumors, we will take advantage of unique orthotopic models for the functional exploration of the significance of inferred oncogenic combinations. The computational and experimental platforms will ultimately generate a restricted set of driving and targetable tumor-addicting oncogenic lesions that will be therapeutically targeted in glioma cells harboring the key alteration(s).","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, and those affected with NF1 are prone to the development of both peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

One in four NF1 individuals experience chronic pain over months to years. Large nodular plexiform neurofibromas developed in deep peripheral nerves or roots are usually associated with permanent disabling pain, and subcutaneous neurofibromas are typically associated with episodes of paroxysmal pain. Migraine frequency is estimated at between 34-62% and recurrent headaches have been reported in almost 80% of patients with NF1.
Aim 1: Assess efficacy of peptide aptamers targeting the Neurofibromin-CRMP2-CaV2.2 interaction in blocking Ca2+ currents in cultured DRGs and TG neurons innervating dura. Rationale: Preliminary data show that TAT-CNIP1 is very efficient in inhibiting Ca2+ currents (Fig. 3.1). To further validate the potential activity of these peptides in mitigating pain and migraine-like pain, we aim to test their efficacy in inhibiting Ca2+ currents selectively in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and TG neurons receiving dural input, respectively. Previous data from the Porreca group has demonstrated that that the percentage of CGRP-positive neurons in TG significantly increases in chronic sumatriptan-treated rats and is sustained two weeks post termination of sumatriptan exposure [57] likely contributing to Òlatent sensitizationÓ. This change is even more pronounced in dural afferent TG neurons. Thus, testing the inhibition of Ca2+ current by the novel peptides in dural afferent TG neurons will further increase the correlation of their in vitro and in vivo efficacy.
Aim 2: Assess efficacy of peptide aptamers targeting the Neurofibromin-CRMP2-CaV2.2 interaction in reducing CGRP release in cultured DRGs and dural afferents. Rationale: We will test if TAT-CNIP1 inhibits the stimulated release of CGRP from peripheral terminals of afferent fibers from the rat dura mater as release of CGRP from dural afferents has been postulated to be a likely mechanism implicated in migraine pain.
Aim 3: Do peptide aptamers targeting the Neurofibromin-CRMP2-CaV2.2 interaction modulate ongoing pain? Rationale: Recently, the Gereau and Hammond groups demonstrated sex-dependent differences in pain responses in Nf1+/- mice with the observation of increased hyperalgesia in female Nf1+/- mice but not male Nf1+/- mice. We recently showed that CRMP2 expression levels directly impact release of the neuropeptide CGRP in sensory neurons [46]. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that CGRP release contributes to migraine pain; blocking VGCCs to control release of CGRPÕs actions seems to have promising therapeutic potential. Intrathecal injection of CGRP also produces hyperalgesia and inflammatory hyperalgesia can be abolished by a CGRP-blocking antibody. It is unknown how the neurofibromin-CRMP2 complex regulates release of CGRP, or other excitatory transmitters, to modulate nociceptive behavior in Nf1+/- mice or the NF1-targeted pig with deletion of human NF1 exon 40. We hypothesize that perturbation of the neurofibromin-CRMP2 complex with interfering peptides will affect transmitter release and thus, nociceptive function in the NF1-targeted pigs.
Aim 4: Do peptide aptamers targeting the Neurofibromin-CRMP2-CaV2.2 interaction abolish the development of tactile allodynia in a rodent model of cephalic pain? Rationale: Migraine patients experience ongoing headache pain that is frequently associated with the development of cutaneous allodynia (CA). The CA begins on one side of the head and progresses to the contralateral side and upper torso likely reflecting central sensitization. In rats, dural afferents can be driven artificially using a cocktail of inflammatory mediators (IM) applied to the dura mater through a previously implanted cannula. Dural inflammation produces delayed and generalized facial and hindpaw allodynia that is reversed by clinically effective anti-migraine drugs including NSAIDs and triptans.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex inherited neurocutaneous disease that results in tumorigenesis especially in nerve tissue; cognitive dysfunction; seizures; headache; and migraine.

Despite their predominantly benign nature, these tumors often have a devastating impact on patients' life quality and treatment options are often limited to tumor resection by surgery - therein endangering long-term nerve integrity and functionality. A clear need exists for alternative therapies. 

In the case of NF2 disease, which is caused by the mutagenic loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoded protein 'merlin', the majority of patients suffer from peripheral nerve damage in addition to various tumor entities, clinically referred to as peripheral neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy can occur in the absence of nerve compressing schwannomas, suggesting tumor-independent events. Concordantly, as merlin exerts an important role in neuronal cell types concerning axon structure maintenance (Schulz et al., 2013) the group of Dr. Helen Morrison has recently proposed a neuron-intrinsic pathogenesis of NF2-related neuropathy. Moreover, neuronally expressed merlin can influence Schwann cell activity in a cell-extrinsic manner, via the Neuregulin1/ErbB pathway required to maintain proper integrity and functionality of peripheral nerves throughout lifetime (Schulz et al., 2014a). Moreover it is known that the precise Neuregulin1/ErbB pathway communication between axons and their adjacent Schwann cells is essential for successful nerve regeneration (Zanazzi et al., 2001;Fricker and Bennett, 2011). 

Because axon-derived signals are crucial for Schwann cells in terms of proliferation and differentiation, we hypothesized that aberrant axon-instructive cues -- caused by loss of merlin in the neuronal compartment -- will increase Schwann cell susceptibility towards mitogenic factors.  Moreover, we expect that loss of merlin in both axons and Schwann cells will lead to aberrant nerve homeostasis and regeneration processes and, more importantly, promote Schwann cell tumorigenesis (Schulz et al., 2014b). We argue that a nerve injury model is a reasonable approach, because compelling evidence from Alison Lloyd's laboratory shows that injury signals in the peripheral nerve can cooperate with loss of Neurofibromin (Nf1), giving rise to neurofibromas. In addition, the frequency of minor peripheral nerve injuries is likely to be underestimated in the general population. 

We have a new mouse model of NF2 disease using the Cre-loxP system creating an nf2 gene heterozygous nerve (specific to Schwann cells and neurons). Experimental nerve crush injuries on sciatic nerves of these genetically modified mice enable us to examine the importance of both nerve microenvironment and regeneration processes for schwannoma development. Strikingly, haploinsufficiency of the nf2 gene, when gene dosage is conditionally reduced in neurons as well as their adjacent Schwann cells, is sufficient to provoke schwannoma formation after nerve crush. Here, tumorlets resembling affected nerves of NF2 patients could be found. In clear contrast, the homozygous loss of nf2 in Schwann cells alone caused a macroscopic nerve thickening following nerve crush, but did not meet the neuropathological criteria for schwannomas. These experimental data clearly indicate a potential tumor promoting microenvironment for Schwann cells. 

In our novel NF2 mouse model using mild nerve injuries to induce spatially and temporally definable Schwann cell tumor growth, we observe a re-differentiation defect of Schwann cells after nerve crush - ultimately leading to prolonged and enhanced proliferation of Schwann cells. Deregulation of Schwann cell plasticity following repair mechanisms may therefore be involved in the formation of schwannomas. The axonally derived protein Neuregulin1, has been shown to be one important signaling cue inducing Schwann cell differentiation (Fricker et al., 2011). Strikingly, we could show that the cell type-specific loss of merlin in neurons leads to a downregulation of Neuregulin 1 expression, resembling the situation in human sural nerve biopsy samples from NF2 patients. 

Assuming that microenvironmental factors, and the intimate interaction of Schwann cell with axons, contribute to schwannoma development following nerve crush in mice with the heterozygous, combined knockout of merlin in neurons Schwann cells in opposition to the homozygous deletion of merlin in Schwann cells - we aim to test this hypothesis by substituting missing Neuregulin1 as driving force for Schwann cell differentiation by protein replacement therapy. Recombinant human Neuregulin1 (rhNRG1) is considered clinically safe as a result of phase 2 clinical trials for heart failure (Mendes-Ferreira et al., 2013) and has already been shown to drive diseased Schwann cells toward differentiation in a mouse model for the hereditary neuropathy (Fledrich et al., 2014). Taken together, we propose that the introduction of a 'differentiation signal' for de-differentiated and proliferating Schwann cells is a promising therapeutic approach for schwannomas because axon-dependent signaling changes contribute to schwannoma development.","Schwann cell derived tumors, referred to as schwannomas, are nerve sheath neoplasms that appear sporadically and in association with genetic syndromes such as Schwannomatosis or Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).

In patients who harbor OPGs involving the posterior visual pathway, VF loss may be the only reflection of visual dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to establish reliable reference data for use of VFs as an outcome measure in children with NF1-associated OPGs to be used for future clinical studies. Further we seek to use this data to investigate the relationship between both VA and radiologic outcomes and VF loss, and to evaluate the impact of treatment of OPGs on VF outcomes as an ancillary study to the CTF-sponsored, multicenter, collaborative clinical study of children with NF1-associated OPGs.",150000,USD,150000,2017-02-01,2017,2019-02-01,2019,Gena Heidary,Boston Children's Hospital,Boston Children's Hospital,grid.2515.3,Boston,Massachusetts,United States,Children's Tumor Foundation,HRA,United States,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.7169554,1113 Ophthalmology and Optometry,1113 Ophthalmology and Optometry,,,,,Rare Diseases; Brain Cancer; Neurosciences; Cancer; Eye Disease And Disorders Of Vision; Brain Disorders; Pediatric; Neurofibromatosis; Clinical Research; Pediatric Cancer,Rare Diseases,Brain Cancer,Neurosciences,Cancer,Eye Disease And Disorders Of Vision,Eye,Eye,,,,,,,,,,,Clinical,Clinical Medicine and Science,,,,,,,Visual pathway  / Optic pathway; Visual pathway  / Optic pathway - Final; NF1 optic glioma; Neurofibromatosis (general - final); Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting); Neurofibromatosis type 1 - Final; Neuro (general) -Draft; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (not reviewed),Visual pathway  / Optic pathway,Visual pathway  / Optic pathway - Final,NF1 optic glioma,Neurofibromatosis (general - final),Neurofibromatosis (Reviewed at meeting),children,children,,,,100,grant.5477876,2015-10-010,The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss,The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular

schwannomas, which often result in deafness despite aggressive management, and for which there is no

cure. Despite advances in neurosurgery, radio-surgery, auditory rehabilitation and molecular biology that have increased treatment options, research continues to show that patients with NF2 report

decreased quality of life (QoL). As the decrease in QoL is primarily due to hearing loss and balance

difficulties, those patients with NF2 who are deaf or experience severe hearing loss are the most

psychosocially vulnerable group across NF2 patients. Due to loss of hearing, as well as due to the facial

weakness that can accompany surgeries aimed at resecting the vestibular schwannomas, these patients report communication difficulties and considerable morbidity. Very little prior research has evaluated the

psychosocial presentation of patients with NF2 who are deaf or have significant hearing loss. From a mental health perspective, the stressors associated with NF2 and hearing impairment and loss challenge inner resources of resilience, often culminating in negative affect, poor self-esteem, and severely impaired QoL. Indeed, the available research identified that patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss report significant social isolation stemming from avoidance of social situations due to difficulties with communication as a consequence of hearing impairment, decreased social support, unemployment and divorce or separations from significant others. Patients with NF2 who are deaf or hearing impaired also report frustration with the lack of attention to this group clinically and through research.

	Given the reported psychosocial presentation of patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe

hearing impairment, it becomes important to develop interventions aimed at increasing QoL in this population and improve symptom management and psycho-emotional functioning. One mind-body treatment that has been found efficacious in improving QoL, psycho-emotional functioning and symptom management, and decreasing stress in patients with chronic illness is the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) delivered in a group format. Within this treatment, patients learn relaxation strategies to decrease the physiological effects of stress and medical symptoms; cognitive strategies to learn to replace negative nonadaptive thoughts with positive, adaptive thoughts; and positive psychology coping skills such as acceptance of things that can't be changed, use of humor, social connectedness, social support and emotional growth. The main goals of the program are improving QoL and ability to cope with symptoms.

	Our team has already determined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effect of a modified

version of the 3RP (e.g., 3RP-NF) in improving QoL in adults with NF within a face-to-face open pilot and a Skype delivered RCT, and is currently testing the 3RP-NF within a Skype RCT in adolescents. During our

adult study, we received multiple inquiries from patients with NF2 with deafness or significant hearing

loss asking to participate in the study, which we could not accommodate at that time. Since then, our

team has researched practical ways to adapt the intervention and we are now able to extend our research and adapt the adult 3RP-NF intervention for adults with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing impaired, the most socially stigmatized and isolated group of patients with NF, by using Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART), the unanimously preferred method of interpretation reported in our focus groups.

Specific aims: This is a single blind pilot RCT that will randomize 60 participants to either the 3RP-NF adapted for patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss, or an attention placebo control (Healthy Living Intervention), both delivered via Skype with CART. The following aims will be tested in adults with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss:

Aim 1: Determine the preliminary efficacy of the 3RP-NF in comparison to the active control HLI in improving the primary outcome (QoL), and secondary outcomes (resiliency, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, coping, social support and mindfulness).

Aim 2: Determine the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted 3RP-NF for NF2 with severe hearing loss

delivered via videoconferencing with Skype aided by CART.

Aim 3: Determine whether the secondary outcomes mediate improvement in QoL, and explore the role of potential moderators (e.g. complete hearing loss  versus not, facial paralyses vs not) on QoL.

Aim 4: Determine whether effects of the intervention are maintained at a 6 months follow up (i.e., durability).

Impact: Findings from this study will support or refute the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy an durability of the 3RP-NF delivered via videoconferencing with Skype aided by CART, in adults with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss. The results will also inform our understanding of the 3RP-NF program in improving QoL and resiliency, and will provide insight into mechanisms of improvement in QoL in patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing impairment. Because we are adapting our successful adult intervention, we will be able to compare the effect of the intervention in adults with NF1, NF2 (but no deafness or severe hearing loss) and schwannomatosis versus adults with NF2 with deafness or severe hearing loss. Positive results from this study could serve as a basis for further research on cost effectiveness of the Skype 3RP-NF with CART, and serve as preliminary data for a large scale RCT in patients with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing loss. Positive results would also provide valuable data to help transition neurofibromatosis clinics toward a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary model of care, and thus improve QoL and reduce health care costs. Given our strong data from our adult trial, we anticipate similar results for adults with NF2 who are deaf or have severe hearing impairment. By providing the same comprehensive (e.g., focused on all NF related symptoms as opposed to only one symptom) intervention to adults, adolescents, and adults with NF2 who have hearing impairment we can more easily facilitate dissemination in clinics, thus potentially improving the long term efficacy of the 3RP-NF, and its incorporation within NF centers across the country and internationally.","Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular

We have previously shown that MEK inhibitors are not effective as single agents in MPNST models but do promote tumor regression when combined with other drugs (Malone et al, 2014, DeRaedt et al, 2014), underscoring the importance of this pathway in MPNSTs. As such we have been looking to develop new combination therapies with MEK inhibitors. We have discovered that MPNSTs are highly sensitive to agents that enhance proteotoxic stress, including HSP90 inhibitors (De Raedt et al. 2011). These findings served as the basis for a phase 1/2 trial combining the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib (Synta Pharmaceuticals) with sirolimus for patients with unresectable or metastatic MPNSTs (SARC023), which is proving to be well tolerated. We would now like to expand this therapeutic paradigm by evaluating the effects of combining a MEK inhibitor with the Hsp90 inhibitor STA-1474. Because this HSP90 inhibitor and the two proposed MEK inhibitors are all being evaluated in clinical trials in NF patients, clinical translation should be straightforward. The selection of the MEK inhibitor to be used for these studies will be based on single clinical responses (in PNF) and discussions about ease of translatability with Dr. Widemann, although these drugs are structurally very similar and can be used interchangeably in mice. Our preliminary observations suggest that this combination should be effective. Moreover, we anticipate that the mechanism by which this combination may function, is likely to be slightly different than the mechanism by which HSP90/mTOR inhibitors function, thereby opening a new area of research. We will begin by testing the combination of STA-1474 and MEKi (PD0325901 or AZD6244) for toxicity and preliminary efficacy in tumor-bearing mice.

There are three major RAS isoforms (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) that are highly homologous but functionally distinct. Although neurofibromin can regulate several RAS isoforms depending on the physiologic and cellular context, it is currently unclear which of these confers the pathogenic effects of NF1 mutations in MPNSTs and therefore might be the best therapeutic target. We recently discovered that genetic ablation of KRAS (specifically), when combined with a MEK inhibitor, potently killed human MPNST cells in vitro (unpublished data). In this study, our goal is to investigate whether silencing of KRAS expression using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has therapeutic potential in vivo, alone and in combination with MEK inhibition. We will use the 16 oligonucleotide ASO that targets the 3Õ untranslated region of human (and mouse) KRAS, developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals. 

Our preliminary preclinical studies suggest that mTOR kinase inhibitors might be even more potent than rapalogues, because they more effectively inhibit the mTOR/eIF4E pathway. Therefore we will first compare the efficacy of the mTOR kinase inhibitors INK128 and AZD2014 in combination with vorinostat. We hypothesize that one or both of these agents will be more effective than rapamycin and will proceed with the ÒwinnerÓ from this study. Next, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of the HDAC inhibitor entinostat, when combined with the superior mTOR inhibitor identified above. Notably, entinostat, which is specific for HDAC 1 and 3, is the first HDAC inhibitor with proven clinical efficacy in solid tumors and as such has high potential to move forward in the clinic. However if entinostat is not effective (based on its selectivity), we will instead focus on evaluating the effects of either belinostat or romidepsin. Our preclinical pipeline has the power to relatively quickly identify the most promising combination therapy, so that we may select the best agents for the clinic.","Currently, MEK inhibitors are showing the most clinical promise in NF1 patients (in plexiform neurofibromas).

Despite the fact that the critical role of fibroblasts has been extensively acknowledged in numerous diseases, the absolute requirement of fibroblasts and collagen for neurofibroma development has not been directly addressed. In the course of our ongoing efforts to study the impact of tumor microenvironment, we identified NG2, a collagen VI receptor, as a specific marker for NAFs and craft a new working model for neurofibroma that highlights the pervasive molecular interactions between fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Indeed, we reason that Nf1 deletion in NFSCs increase TGF-b secretion which stimulates NAFs to secrete collagen I. In turn, collagen I acts on ?2?1integrin receptor located on NFSCs to stimulate their proliferation. In addition, NFSCs secrete collagen VI which promotes migration and survival/proliferation of NAFs through NG2 activation. Thus, collagen-secreting fibroblasts may play a vital role in driving SC proliferation in neurofibroma context. We propose an experimental plan to evaluate the absolute requirement of collagen I and NG2+ fibroblasts for neurofibroma development in vivo. In addition, we will determine the collagen paracrine signaling between fibroblasts and Schwann cells as well as develop strategies to interfere with specific fibrosis validated targets. Importantly, demonstrating the crucial role of collagen-secreting fibroblast for neurofibroma development will immediately open the doors to a wide array of clinically approved drugs already effectively targeting fibroblasts in classic organ fibrosis and cancer.","Neurofibroma is the most common tumor in NF1 and typically presents as a disorganized nerve structure composed of proliferative Schwann cells (NFSC) mix with Neurofibroma-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) in an abundant collagen matrix. Despite the fact that the critical role of fibroblasts has been extensively acknowledged in numerous diseases, the absolute requirement of fibroblasts and collagen for neurofibroma development has not been directly addressed. In the course of our ongoing efforts to study the impact of tumor microenvironment, we identified NG2, a collagen VI receptor, as a specific marker for NAFs and craft a new working model for neurofibroma that highlights the pervasive molecular interactions between fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Indeed, we reason that Nf1 deletion in NFSCs increase TGF-b secretion which stimulates NAFs to secrete collagen I. In turn, collagen I acts on ?2?1integrin receptor located on NFSCs to stimulate their proliferation. In addition, NFSCs secrete collagen VI which promotes migration and survival/proliferation of NAFs through NG2 activation. Thus, collagen-secreting fibroblasts may play a vital role in driving SC proliferation in neurofibroma context. We propose an experimental plan to evaluate the absolute requirement of collagen I and NG2+ fibroblasts for neurofibroma development in vivo.

Despite this, nothing is known about metabolic adaptations occurring in NF1 tumorigenesis. We propose that aberrant activation of Ras/ERK signaling impacts on metabolism, providing a selective advantage to NF1 tumor cells. Understanding these metabolic changes will pave the way for the design of novel, highly specific anti-neoplastic drugs for NF1-associated tumors against which there are no current treatments.  
My sponsor, Dr. A. Rasola, has demonstrated a pro-neoplastic activity of the mitochondrial branch of Ras/ERK pathway, supporting the hypothesis that mitochondria are key controllers of metabolic and survival circuits. I have observed that loss of neurofibromin decreases mitochondrial respiration and switches cell metabolism toward a glycolytic phenotype; this is accompanied by inhibition of respiratory complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH), which matches the interaction between SDH and TRAP1, a mitochondrial chaperone. Our group has recently proven that, by inhibiting SDH, TRAP1 leads to succinate accumulation and to the ensuing HIF1? stabilization thereby promoting neoplasm growth. My data indicate that TRAP1 silencing prompts a remarkable inhibition of the tumorigenic potential of cells lacking neurofibromin, demonstrating for the first time a mechanistic link between metabolic rewiring and NF1 tumorigenesis (manuscript in preparation). 
The long term goal of the project outlined in this application is to determine the relevance of TRAP1 in neurofibroma development through the use of both in vivo NF1 models and the biochemical dissection of its mode of regulation of mitochondrial physiology. The first task will be carried out by knocking-down TRAP1 in mouse Nf1-deficient Schwann cell precursors which generate plexiform neurofibromas when transplanted in sciatic nerves of nude mice. Growth and metabolic features of tumors will be investigated by assessing their bioenergetic and redox properties and relating them to activation of oncogenic signals. Should TRAP1 inhibition impact on neurofibroma progression, I will assess tumor growth after crossing NF1 mouse models with TRAP1 knock-out mice. In addition, I will characterize the tumorigenic and metabolic features of primary Schwann cells obtained from neurofibromas of NF1 patients after down-regulating TRAP1. In a second strictly related set of studies, I will explore how TRAP1 causes metabolic adaptations of neurofibroma cells. I have observed that TRAP1 and SDH associate with a mitochondrial fraction of ERK which is hyperactive in cells lacking neurofibromin. On the strength of this observation suggesting a direct molecular connection between metabolic changes and Ras/ERK dysregulation in NF1, I will investigate if TRAP1-mediated metabolic adaptation of neurofibromindeficient cells is achieved through ERK-dependent phosphorylation events occurring inside mitochondria.  
This study explores the innovative possibility that neurofibromin loss contributes to tumorigenesis by TRAP1-mediated metabolic changes. TRAP1, which is markedly increased in tumors, constitutes a promising target for a new class of anti-neoplastic compounds to be used in NF1 patients.

In vivo screening system I will develop a CRISPR-based system that will allow me to mutate up to 3 driver genes simultaneously through intracranial injection of virus particles delivering a CRISPR construct. A Luciferase marker will allow me to elegantly track tumor progression using the IVIS imaging machine and thus without the need for expensive and highly specialized equipment like mouse CT or MRI scanners. The proposed system will allow me to generate more genetically accurate mouse models for central nervous system tumors without the need to generate complex genetic knock out mouse models. The enormous flexibility, speed and accuracy, and importantly the ease by which I will be able to trace tumor progression hence turns this CRISPR modeling system into a powerful tool for biological research and preclinical testing.  Proof of Principle: Nf1 and p53 driven high-grade gliomas NF1 associated high-grade gliomas harbor, besides NF1 mutations, mutations in P53 or CDKN2A (Gutmann et al. 2003). Importantly, as mentioned before high-grade gliomas robustly form in NF1 and P53 conditional GFAP-cre mice (Zhu et al. 2005). Hence as a first proof of principle experiment I will generate a CRISPR construct that targets Nf1 and p53.
Aim 2: Functionally validate potential drivers for low- and high grade NF1 associated gliomas Non-optic pathway Low-grade NF1 gliomas (Svil-Nf1). 
Whole genome sequencing data of 3 low-grade NF1 associated gliomas are publicly available (Gutmann et al., Genome Research 2013). This small scale sequencing effort identified 6 genes harboring mutations (DST, FYTTD1, GPATCH2, OR13C3, PIK3R2, SVIL); none of these hits have been followed up. Some of these candidate drivers however are extremely promising. In order to evaluate the importance of SVIL loss in low-grade glioma formation, I will generate 2 constructs one targeting Svil and Nf1 and one targeting only Nf1 and compare the rate and speed of the tumor formation after intracranial injection of viral particles. Importantly, it has been shown that, in mice, an Nf1 heterozygous background is important for the formation of NF1 associated optic pathway gliomas (Bajenaru et al. Cancer Research 2003). Therefore experiments will be conducted in Cas9 and Luciferase conditional mice that are hemizygous for Nf1. High-grade NF1 gliomas (Arhgap18-Nf1-Cdkn2a) Twenty-seven non-silent mutations were found by whole exome sequencing on a single high-grade glioma (Midline, WHO grade IV) of a 13 year old NF1 patient. (Wu et al., Nature Genetics 2014). Interestingly, besides an additional somatic mutation in NF1 (F2176fs) and a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, 2 of these genes (ARHGAP18 and PLXNB1) could be directly linked to Rho signaling, a third one PTPRF indirectly (through interaction with TRIO). As RhoGTPases ARHGAP18 and PLXNB1 directly inactivate GTP bound RHO, loss of these GTPases could greatly augment cell mobility and have an important role in tumor progression. The frame shift mutation in ARHGAP18 (F487fs) is located in the RhoGAP domain and predicted to completely abrogate the GTPase function. The involvement of ARHGAP18 in high-grade NF1 associated gliomas will be investigated by comparing tumor formation of mice injected with viral particles targeting ARHGAP18-Nf1-Cdkn2a to those targeting Nf1- Cdkn2a alone. The proof of principle experiments of aim 1 will inform us how fast mice injected with viral particles targeting Nf1-p53 form gliomas; we expect a similar kinetics for Nf1-Cdkn2a gliomas. Data from aim 1 will thus allow us to perform an accurate power analysis. However assuming control tumors form on average after 13 weeks (similar to classical GEMM), when we use 10 animals in each experimental group I have a power of 80% to significantly (?=0.05, sd=3 weeks, 2 sample t-test) detect a reduction in tumor latency by 4 weeks.
Aim 3: Identify alterations in low and high-grade gliomas of NF1 patients
The identification of early drivers involved in progression to high-grade gliomas could help us identify which patients are at high risk for progression and thus help decide if aggressive treatment of these benign tumors is warranted. Therefore I am collecting a large number of both non-optic pathway low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas of NF1 patients. Tumors and blood-matched pairs will be comprehensively analyzed by whole genome sequencing, array CGH and RNA seq. After an extensive data analysis, potential genetic drivers and important pathways will be validated using my new in vivo modeling system. I have set up collaborative agreements with multiple groups to receive an initial set of about 20 tumors. This project will also give us the opportunity to develop clinically relevant mouse models for low and high-grade NF1 associated gliomas that can be used for basic research and pre-clinical testing.","Aim 1: Developing a fast, powerful in vivo modeling system for central nervous system tumors

However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent due to methodological weaknesses. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) international collaboration Neurocognitive Committee, formed to review and recommend cognitive outcome measurement tools for use in clinical trials, has recognized the strengths of novel, computerized assessment batteries for use in clinical trials. Many of these test batteries were developed specifically for use in clinical trials, have strong psychometric properties, and prospectively deal with issues around practice effects, which is vital in determining functional change following an intervention. Another imperative feature of any test used in a clinical trial is that it demonstrates adequate test-retest reliability in a given clinical population. None of these tools have disease-specific normative data nor is there information on the reliability of the instruments in NF1 specifically. The importance of the proposed study emerged when we analyzed test-retest reliability on children with NF1 who were on the placebo control arm of a recent statin trial (STARS) from baseline to week 16. The reliability coefficients ranged from unacceptable (r=.08) to modest for the computerized cognitive tasks from the CANTAB (the battery used as the primary outcomes for this trial; Payne, personal communication). These findings are of significant concern, as they highlight limitations in the ability of this and likely other cognitive tests to adequately detect change in the NF1 population. This led to the current proposal, which aims to collect NF1-specific data to determine the test-retest reliability and validity of the two additional computerized cognitive batteries that the REiNS committee has under current consideration; Cogstate and the NIH Toolbox. The proposed research is of significant importance to the NF community as unreliable tools will limit our ability to detect response to interventions and also impact the utilization of resources negatively. Without adequate tools to quantify change in cognitive functions following treatment, clinical trials will be significantly limited in identifying successfully cognitive interventions in NF1.","There is an increase in development of clinical trials targeting cognition in children with NF1.

The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) international collaboration Neurocognitive Committee, formed to review and recommend cognitive outcome measurement tools for use in clinical trials, has recognized the strengths of novel, computerized assessment batteries for use in clinical trials. Many of these test batteries were developed specifically for use in clinical trials, have strong psychometric properties, and prospectively deal with issues around practice effects, which is vital in determining functional change following an intervention. Another imperative feature of any test used in a clinical trial is that it demonstrates adequate test-retest reliability in a given clinical population. None of these tools have disease-specific normative data nor is there information on the reliability of the instruments in NF1 specifically. The importance of the proposed study emerged when we analyzed test-retest reliability on children with NF1 who were on the placebo control arm of a recent statin trial (STARS) from baseline to week 16. The reliability coefficients ranged from unacceptable (r=.08) to modest for the computerized cognitive tasks from the CANTAB (the battery used as the primary outcomes for this trial; Payne, personal communication). These findings are of significant concern, as they highlight limitations in the ability of this and likely other cognitive tests to adequately detect change in the NF1 population. This led to the current proposal, which aims to collect NF1-specific data to determine the test-retest reliability and validity of the two additional computerized cognitive batteries that the REiNS committee has under current consideration; Cogstate and the NIH Toolbox. The proposed research is of significant importance to the NF community as unreliable tools will limit our ability to detect response to interventions and also impact the utilization of resources negatively.

In NF1 individuals, loss of neurofibromin results in high levels of activated Ras, leading to the development of multiple benign and malignant tumors.

Plexiform neurofibromas, a hallmark of NF1, are known precursor lesions, which can undergo cancerous transformation into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive spindle-cell sarcoma. This transformation takes place as a multi-step process during which additional genetic and epigenetic alterations accumulate over time. In the initial step of this process, biallelic inactivating mutations must occur in the NF1 gene, leading to loss of function of neurofibromin and hyperactivation of Ras and multiple Ras effector pathways. Additional critical cooperative events include loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53, which among its many functions blocks the activation of HIF-1? and subsequent overexpression of VEGF, oncogenic polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components (e.g. SUZ12) and over-expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). As a consequence, cell growth is deregulated, growth factor pathways are upregulated and tumor-induced neoangiogenesis occurs to support the increasing metabolic demands.

Unfortunately, MPNSTs are extremely difficult to treat and current therapies have shown little long-term benefit, with most individuals succumb to these cancers within 5 years following diagnosis. While there have been intense efforts to develop novel treatment strategies for MPNSTs, early chemoprevention remains a largely unexplored area in NF1, although compelling evidence highlighting the benefits of chemoprevention with COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib, sulindac, aspirin) exists in multiple other malignancies with high-risk precursor lesions. 

As the development of new chemical agents for chemoprevention is a long, difficult and expensive process, a potential strategy to circumventing these challenges is to discover new applications for compounds with an established track record of safe and long-term use in humans. Here, we show that mebendazole (MBZ), an FDA-approved anthelmintic with a lengthy track record of safe long-term human use and significant anti-neoplastic effect in our most aggressive glioblastoma and medulloblastoma animal models, is able to inhibit multiple crucial steps in the oncogenesis of NF1 associated MPNSTs, including cell proliferation, neoangiogenesis via VEGFR2 kinase blockage, and perhaps most importantly Ras activity. By inhibiting these key elements in MPNST oncogenesis, MBZ could reduce the need for more aggressive surgical or toxic interventions and subsequently significantly lower the mortality and morbidity in this patient population. Thus, we propose to repurpose MBZ for preventing the malignant transformation from a benign neurofibroma to a lethal MPNST with the following aims: 1. Evaluate the chemopreventative efficacy of MBZ in the NF1+/-; TP53+/- transgenic mouse model, which spontaneously develops MPNSTs, to assess both the efficacy as a chemoprevention agent and the long-term safety profiles using survival as well as imaging and histological examination techniques; and 2. Evaluate the combined use of MBZ with COX-2 inhibitors, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to enhance the chemopreventative effect in the NF1+/-; TP53+/- transgenic mouse model. COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated benefits as chemoprevention agents in colorectal cancer and showed therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of NF1-derived MPNSTs. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish the preclinical evidence for MBZ therapy as a chemoprevention agent in NF1 and if effective, design a clinical trial for NF1 patients with high-risk plexiform neurofibromas, either with MBZ alone or in combination with COX-2 inhibitors.","The RASopathy Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that encodes the GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) neurofibromin.

Albeit benign, PNs can be disfiguring, can dangerously compress surrounding tissues or undergo transformation into highly aggressive sarcomas termed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. PN formation and growth specifically require the deregulated induction of the Ras/ERK transduction axis that follows homozygous loss-of-function mutations at the NF1 gene, which encodes the Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP) neurofibromin. 

Oncogenic signalling via the Ras/ERK pathway contributes to the metabolic rewiring of neoplastic cells, and mitochondria, where many crucial metabolic processes occur, can play a promoter role in these metabolic changes that allow cells to thrive in the conditions of limited oxygen supply they encounter during the accrual of the neoplastic mass. We have previously shown that the Ras/ERK transduction pathway has a mitochondrial branch in tumor cells, which could therefore regulate the bioenergetic rearrangements that underpin tumor growth. We have also recently demonstrated that inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme placed at the crossroad between Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), by the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 has an oncogenic role. Indeed TRAP1-dependent inhibition of SDH increases intracellular levels of the oncometabolite succinate, which in turn activates the pro-neoplastic programs of the transcription factor HIF1. 

These observations suggest the possibility that hyperactive ERK might induce the oncogenic activity of TRAP1 in mitochondria of PN cells, whose metabolic features were never investigated.

Our project is based on a solid ground of preliminary data that corroborate this hypothesis, and in particular on the observation that knocking-down TRAP1 expression abolishes in vitro and in vivo neoplastic growth of cells lacking neurofibromin. We will therefore target TRAP1 for the identification of inhibitors to be used as potential chemotherapeutics for the treatment of PNs. To this aim we will utilize a molecular dynamics approach to detect selective TRAP1 druggable sites and to predict molecular scaffolds that could act as allosteric TRAP1 inhibitors. These compounds will then be utilized in a stepwise approach to test their efficacy first as inhibitors of TRAP1 biochemical activity, then as modulators of the bioenergetics and viability of PN cells and eventually as inhibitors of their in vitro and in vivo neoplastic growth.","Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a complex tumor that develops within perineural sheaths of nerve bundles in patients with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a tumor-predisposing genetic syndrome.

Currently, no effective therapeutic modalities for MPNST treatment are available and the molecular events triggering Schwann cell transformation to MPNST are poorly understood. Preliminary data indicated that mice with Lats1/2 (components of the Hippo signaling pathway) deficiency in the Schwann cell lineage developed both benign and MPNST-like peripheral nerve sheath tumors with 100% penetrance and short latency. Therefore, Lats1/2 may function as a hitherto undiscovered tumor suppressor in MPNSTs by orchestrating Hippo signaling and other oncogenic pathways. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Hippo signaling dysregulation transforms Schwann cells into MPNST. Combined genome-wide studies will be used to identify Hippo target genes or pathways that regulate peripheral nerve tumorigenesis. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic ablation approaches will be used to determine whether tumor growth can be inhibited by blocking TAZ/YAP activation and tumor-associated oncogenic pathways. The long-term objective of this application is to develop compounds that target the Hippo pathway as a promising therapeutic avenue to improve the treatment of MPNST.","Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are among the most devastating soft tissue sarcomas and are a major cause of mortality in adult NF patients.

Given that both plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs arise within the Schwann cell linage, we have developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify targeted therapeutics for treating NF1-related neoplasia, including MPNSTs. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we have created immortalized human Nf1-deficient Schwann cell lines that have been utilized for selective lethality screens for compounds lethal to NF1-deficient cells. By assaying ~12,000 compounds, ~20 compounds selectively lethal to NF1-deficient cells have been identified.  In this proposal, we will examine these existing hits in combination with MEK inhibition. We will also use CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer additional genetic alterations known to be found in the transition to MPNSTs. A top candidate would be SUZ12, as loss of the PCRC is nearly universal in MPNSTs. Characterization of the oncogenic potential of these cells, transcriptional profiling, and comparisons to our existing NF1 deficient cell lines will give insights into the transition to a malignant state. SUZ12 NF1 double mutant cells become an ideal tool for screening epigenetic targeted drug libraries for efficacy in a cell line that more closely resembles, genetically, an MPNST.","Treatment options for plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs are limited, and finding new molecular targets for therapeutics effective against these is critical for NF1 patient care.

We have created models of JMML in mice by disrupting Nf1 or expressing a KrasD12 oncogene. In prior studies supported by the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Consortium (NFTC), these mice could be effectively treated with inhibitors of MEK (PD0325901 and trametinib), PI3K (GDC-0941) or Akt (MK-2206). In a complementary approach, we studied the therapeutic potential of PLX51107, a small molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomain proteins such as BRD4. PLX51107 attenuated myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) in both models. We hypothesize that a combination of PLX51107 and a signal transduction inhibitor might have improved efficacy. Therefore, we will test PLX51107 combinations to selectively ablate Nf1 and Kras mutant hematopoietic stem cells. As the mechanism by which PLX51107 improved MPN in the mouse models is unknown, we will also generate biochemical data in these models that will a) implicate specific genes and pathways as mechanistic targets of PLX51107, and b) provide baseline data for development of biomarkers in human clinical trials. We anticipate that our studies in the hematopoietic system will reveal mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapeutic responses that are relevant to plexiform neurofibromas or MPNST.","Children with NF1 are at 200-500 fold increased risk of developing juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which carries a poor prognosis even with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
