Abstract
A clinical and genetic study of type 2
neurofibromatosis (NF2) has been carried
out in the United Kingdom. Virtually
complete ascertainment of cases in the
north-west of England was achieved and
suggests a population incidence of 1 in
33 000 to 40 000. In the UK as a whole, 150
cases have been identified and been used
to study the clinical and genetic features
of NF2. The autosomal dominant inherit-
ance of NF2 was confirmed, 49% of cases
were assessed as representing new muta-
tions, and the mutation rate was estimated
to be 6 5 x 10-6. Evidence to support a
maternal gene effect was found in that age
at onset was 18-17 years in 36 maternally
inherited cases and 24 5 in 20 paternally
inherited cases (p = 0 027). The preponder-
ance of maternally inherited cases was also
significant (p = 0-03). Data are presented
which suggest that there are two types of
NF2, one with later onset and bilateral
vestibular schwannomas as the only usual
feature, and the other with earlier onset
and multiple other tumours. A consider-
able number of cases did not fall easily
into one or other group and other factors
such as maternal effect on severity and
anticipation need to be considered.
(J Med Genet 1992;29:841-6)

The first probable case of NF2 was reported
by Wishart in 1820,' predating von Reckl-
inghausen's paper on type 1 neurofibromatosis
(NFl)2 by over half a century. Following the
description of von Recklinghausen's disease,
however, many subsequent authors tended to
classify patients with NF1 and NF2 as having
the same disorder and failed to recognise the
very different natural history of the two con-
ditions. Although in 1930 Gardner and Fra-
zier3 reported a large kindred with bilateral
vestibular schwannomas and suggested that
the entity represented a separate, central form
of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, in
their large study in 1956 Crowe et at' did not
distinguish between the two forms. Further-
more they reported that 5% of patients with

von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis had
acoustic neuromas. In retrospect it is clear
these patients had NF2.

The last two decades have seen an increasing
awareness of the importance of distinguishing
the different forms of neurofibromatosis.59
This period saw initial confusion in nomencla-
ture with NF1 being referred to as peripheral
or von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis and
NF2 as central or bilateral acoustic neurofi-
bromatosis. In 1987 the mapping of the gene
for NFl to chromosome 171011 and that of NF2
to chromosome 221213 confirmed the clinical
impression that the two diseases were distinct.
The NIH Consensus Conference on neurofi-
bromatosis in the same year gave clear guide-
lines on the nomenclature and diagnostic cri-
teria of the two types (table 1).

nerve,

cranial

In 1991 the NIH Consensus Conference on
Acoustic Neuroma recommended another change
to terminology. As the tumours are composed
of schwann cells and typically involve the vesti-
bular rather than the acoustic branch of the
eighth
the term vestibular
schwannoma rather than acoustic neuroma is
suggested. We have therefore adopted this term.
As early as 1937 it was suggested NF2 could
be divided into a severe and mild form.14
Recent studies have again drawn attention to
this,'5 recommending the severe form should
be called Wishart, with early onset bilateral
vestibular schwannomas and multiple other
tumour types, and the mild form be called
Gardner type, with usually only late onset
bilateral vestibular schwannoma. It has also
been suggested that the family reported by Lee
and Abbott'6 with multiple meningiomas as a
major feature may be a third subtype.

Our interest in NF2 arose from genetic
linkage studies and from the setting up of a
neurofibromatosis register in Manchester in
1988 which led us to meet many subjects with

Diagnostic criteria for NF2.

NF2. The need for a clinical and genetic study
of the disease was identified. There have been
no previous population based- studies on NF2
and no large studies in the British population.
In this paper we report the genetic analysis of
our study population and in the following
paper guidelines for counselling and manage-
ment are given. A detailed clinical description
is reported elsewhere.'7

paediatricians,

Patients and methods
The study was carried out from May 1989 to
October 1991. Patients were ascertained by
contacting neurosurgeons, ENT surgeons,
dermatologists,
neurologists,
and geneticists throughout the UK. Particular
effort was made to reach full ascertainment for
the north-west of England where case identifi-
cation was augmented by extracting all cases of
bilateral vestibular schwannoma and double
primary vestibular schwannoma and men-
ingioma from the North West Regional Cancer
Registry occurring in the last 28 years. In
addition to known cases of bilateral vestibular
schwannoma, our ascertainment criteria included
cases of unilateral vestibular schwannoma with
spinal tumour or meningioma, multiple men-
ingioma, and multiple spinal tumours.

Once a patient had been identified, per-
mission was obtained to visit them and their
first degree relatives at home. A standard ques-
tionnaire and clinical examination was com-
pleted for all family members; when possible a
slit lamp examination of the lens was per-
formed. After assessment a subject was classi-
fied as affected if their clinical features satisfied
the NIH diagnostic criteria for NF2 (table 1).

Results
PATIENT ASCERTAINMENT
North West Regional study
After exclusion on the basis of insufficient
criteria for the diagnosis of NF2, 19 living
subjects were identified as having the con-
dition in the North Western Regional Health
Authority of England. A further nine cases
who had died before the study were also iden-
tified. The diagnosis was confirmed from hos-
pital records, scans, registration with the Re-
gional Cancer Registry, and by personal
examination; all but one of the living patients
was examined by one of the authors. The total
28 cases came from 20 families. In five families
the index case had died and no further affected
family members were identified. A further two
families were studied who had affected rela-
tives outside the primary study area. No new
cases were detected.

UK study
Although prevalence and incidence
data
needed to be obtained from a population where
100% ascertainment was possible, the 28 cases
identified in the North West Region alone
would have been too small for other analyses.
We have received information on 150 cases
from 91 families of whom 110 are alive; 97

patients have been examined by one of the
authors and the majority of first degree rela-
tives have also been seen. Audiological tests
and cranial CT or MRI scans have been per-
formed in many at risk relatives where possible
to exclude subclinical disease.

DISEASE PREVALENCE
Prevalence was calculated from all affected
persons in the population of the North West
was
Regional
4016 100 on prevalence day (1 June 1990).
This gave a minimum prevalence of 19/
4 016 100, that is 0 47 per 100 000 (4.7/106) of
the population. The true prevalence is likely to
be much higher as this figure includes only
those who have a formal diagnosis of NF2.

which

Mean age at diagnosis in 110 subjects
throughout the UK was 27-55 years and the
severity of the condition results in early death
in the majority of cases. Disease course from
onset of symptoms averages 18-5 years,5 but in
22 cases in the UK the duration from diagnosis
averaged only 8-09 years. Including the living
cases, mean actuarial survival from diagnosis
was 15 years. It would be logical to assume a
greater degree of diagnostic delay among new
mutations, especially as 13/56 familial cases
were diagnosed asymptomatically. Including
the asymptomatic cases as zero delay from
onset of symptoms, the mean delay was 4-91
years in familial cases compared to 6-28 years
in sporadic cases.

In the North West Region there were 27
asymptomatic offspring of affected cases at
50% prior risk. A further case at 50% prior
risk from a family outside the region but
resident in Manchester was added. Analysis of
the at risk offspring using age at onset data
(table 2) predicted that 8-74 cases were likely to
be heterozygotes. As approximately 50% of
cases arise as new mutations, a similar number
of asymptomatic sporadic heterozygotes would
be expected. This gives a prevalence of 34-48
per 4 003 500 or 0-86 per 100 000.

BIRTH INCIDENCE
The diagnostic prevalence would underesti-
mate birth incidence because of the late age at
presentation and the early expected death.
Death occurred at a mean age of 38-4 years in
37 cases, although mean actuarial survival was

63 years including the living cases (table 2).
Therefore other assessments of disease inci-
dence had to be used. In the decade 1980 to
1989, 17 cases of NF2 were diagnosed in the
North West Region. This represents an annual
incidence of 1 case per 2 355 000 people. The
median birth year for those being diagnosed in
that decade was 1958 (range 1926 to 1976) and
the average age at diagnosis of NF2 was 27-55
years. Using the annual birth rates for the
region for the decade around 1958 (1953 to
1962), as suggested by both these pieces of
information, this represented a birth incidence
of 1 per 40 562 (17/689 568 live births).

Using age at diagnosis and current regional
statistics for those alive in the five year age
groups, the cumulative incidence can be calcu-
lated from the annual incidence rate for each
age group. The cumulative incidence is a good
approximation to the lifetime risk of develop-
ing NF2 in the absence of competing morta-
lity. The cumulative incidence provides an
estimate of birth incidence as long as the age
specific incidence rate is constant over time."8
By this method the birth incidence was esti-
mated to be 1 in 33 000. Both these calcula-
tions assume 100% penetrance and the former
that there is no loss of NF2 cases from birth
before diagnosis.

PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
Although we have received information on 150
cases from 91 families of whom 110 are alive,
information was considered complete in only
68 pedigrees containing 122 cases; 110 of these
cases had full details of age of onset and disease
course.

The pedigrees were consistent with the
expected autosomal dominant inheritance of
NF2. There were many examples of male to
male transmission and there was no statistic-
ally significant difference in the number of
each sex affected when NF2 was inherited
from a known case (30/57 were male). As the
mean age at diagnosis was 27-55 years, the
number of definite NF2 cases was less than the
expected 50% figure (57/181). However, when
children under the age of 10 are excluded
(diagnosis occurred in only 1/110 cases in this
series), the figure is less discrepant (57/146).
There was one four generation family and six
three generation families.

Of these 110 cases, 36 were considered to
have inherited the gene for NF2 from their
mother, 20 from their father, and 54 were

considered to have arisen as new mutations.
The difference in number of cases inheriting the
gene from each parent was significant (p = 0-03).
A case was considered to have arisen through
new mutation only after an extensive family
history was taken for features of NF2 in rela-
tives. Where possible the parents and sibs were
also examined and the outcome in 49/54 fami-
lies studied by the authors is shown in table 3.
There appeared to be a marked degree of
heterogeneity within NF2. Our pedigrees con-
firmed previous reports of marked interfami-
lial variation of disease; presentations within a
family were relatively uniform although with
some variation in age of presentation. There
were two broad types of families.

(1) Mild: characterised by relatively late on-
set (>15 years, but usually >25 years) of
bilateral vestibular schwannoma, with only
minimal skin manifestations and occasional
other CNS tumours (no more than one spinal
tumour or meningioma). Progression of tu-
mours is often very slow.

(2) Severe: with early onset (< 30 years, but
usually < 25 years) and meningiomas and spi-
nal tumours in frequent numbers (at least two
of one type and usually multiple) in addition to
bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are
the presenting feature in only 50% of cases.
Disease course is often rapid causing severe
handicap or death before reproductive age.
The peripheral features are more pronounced
in the severe cases.

Examples of three families with the mild
type and two with the severe type, with both
maternal and paternal inheritance, are pre-
sented in table 4. There were, however, a large
number of cases (12/120) which did not fit
exactly into this classification, for example,
two cases with multiple meningiomas and a
unilateral vestibular schwannoma presenting
at 30 and 43 years respectively. A 28 year old
woman whose father had typical type 2a dis-
ease, with onset aged 28 years, presented aged
6 years with seizures owing to a meningioma
and has since developed a spinal tumour.
Another woman with a family history of type
2a disease presented aged 8 years with a vesti-
bular schwannoma and now has a meningioma
at 21 years. In contrast to typical type 2b cases
these two are extremely well and disease
course and tumour growth has been slow, as in
another case who at the age of 11 years
reverted from the family type 2a disease course
by presenting with a spinal tumour. No fami-
lial case has reverted from type 2b to type 2a;

although some offspring of type 2b cases pre-
sented with a vestibular schwannoma, they
inevitably went on to develop multiple other
tumours. Only 4/60 type 2a cases presented
with symptoms not resulting from a vestibular
schwannoma compared to 23/60 type 2b cases
who presented with symptoms resulting from
a spinal tumour or meningioma. We found no
evidence for any other types of NF2 or cases
with classical features of NF1 and NF2.

ESTIMATION OF FITNESS
This was performed by comparing number of
offspring of affected cases per 100 reproductive
years with their unaffected sibs. The relative
fitness was 0 93 overall. Affected cases had 158
offspring in 1958 reproductive years. Unaffec-
ted cases had 309 offspring in 3561 years.

MUTATION RATE
Direct method
Mutation rate by the direct method21 used the
number of cases from the decade studied
caused by new mutation; 9/17 cases where the

family had been studied represent new muta-
tions. Seven cases were clearly familial and a
further case had not had a family study.
Therefore:
Mutation rate =

9/2 x 689 568=(6-5±2-16) x 10-6.

Indirect method
As we have calculated the birth incidence as 1
in 33 to 40 562 and it is unlikely that a case will
not eventually present with diagnostic features
even as a new mutation, the indirect method
can also be used."8
Mutation rate=

incidence x (1-fitness)/2= (1 -8 2) x 10-6.

PARENTAL AGE AND MUTATION
The birth order data on 44 new mutations are
presented in table 5. Information was con-
sidered inadequate in the remaining 10 fami-
lies. No significant birth order effect was found
using the method of Haldane and Smith22 to
analyse the data (p = 0 75). For 39 of the new
mutations the age of both parents at their birth
was known. The mean paternal age was 31-18
and mean maternal age was 27-31. This com-
pares with expected ages of 30-19 and 27T15

years respectively when corrected for year of
birth and taken from the Registrar General's
population data. This difference is not significant.

PARENTAL EFFECT ON SEVERITY
The mean age at first symptom or diagnosis in
36 maternally inherited cases was 18-17 years
(SD 8-84, SE 1V47, median 18). The mean age
in paternally inherited cases was 24-5 years
(SD 11-83, SE 2-65, median 22-5). The dif-
ference in average age of onset of 6-33 years
was significant
(p = 0-026). There was a
general impression of a worse clinical course in
maternally inherited cases and average age at
death in six cases was 24-33 years, compared to
39-33 in three paternally inherited cases.

Discussion
A population based study of NF2 in the UK
has identified 150 cases from 91 families.
Segregation analysis confirmed the expected
autosomal dominant single gene mode of
transmission. There is almost complete pene-
trance by the age of 60, although a broader
definition than the NIH consensus criteria is
required.23 There were no cases of affected sibs
born to apparently normal parents and no
cases of proven non-penetrance within fami-
lies. One 67 year old obligate carrier resident
in New Zealand
has had two affected
daughters, and although he has required a
hearing aid for some years has only recently
had investigations to confirm his diagnosis.
The only case not to be confirmed was a 36
year old obligate carrier who inherited the
gene from her mother. She has had two affec-
ted children, but died of a myocardial infarc-
tion at the age of 36 with no suspicious features
of NF2. One case of probable non-penetrance
was reported by Young et al,24 although she
died in her early fifties without specific invest-
igation. Kanter et aF also confirmed autosomal
dominant inheritance in nine kindreds they
studied personally and 15 published ones. A
further two possible cases of non-penetrance
were alluded to, but no information on age was
given. Penetrance is likely therefore to be close
to 100% by 60, especially if modern diagnostic
imaging (MRI with gadolinium enhancement)
is used to confirm the diagnosis.

Although we have drawn attention to the
heterogeneity in NF2 the evidence for two
subtypes as described recently is still not over-
whelming.'5 Some cases are very difficult to
classify if they have a single meningioma in
addition to vestibular schwannomas, while
other cases with late onset may have multiple
meningiomas. Classifying the condition purely
on age at onset is clearly artificial, especially in
view of the maternal gene effect. In view of the
recent molecular analysis in myotonic dys-
trophy,25 another mechanism which has to be
considered to explain variable age at onset is
anticipation. As so few multigeneration fami-
lies were identified in the present study, this
issue is difficult to address. It is of interest that
in the initial report of the largest NF2 family
reported to date, Gardner and Frazier' drew

attention to the decrease in age at death in
successive generations (72, 64, 42, and 28 years
in generations I to IV respectively). The clon-
ing of the NF2 gene will mean that the patho-
genesis of these clinical observations can be
addressed at the molecular level. At a practical
level the very different disease course and
manifestations in some families remains very
constant and has clinical implications as dis-
cussed elsewhere.26
There have been no previous population
based studies of NF2. Previous estimates of
prevalence are likely to have been underesti-
mates.5 The only estimate of incidence9 ap-
pears to have been accurate, although no state-
ment is made- as to how it was calculated. It is
likely that a birth incidence of around 1 in 30
to 50 000 holds true for most of the western
world. There is
little information on non-
Caucasian populations, although there were
three cases from two families from the Indian
subcontinent in this series. The major diffi-
culty in assessing birth incidence is the late age
at diagnosis, 27-55 years in this study, and
early age at death. A diagnostic prevalence in
this study of 1 in 210 000 would have seriously
underestimated both incidence and mutation
rate if used in the direct method of calculation.
We have assumed 100% eventual penetrance
in our study, so the only possible upward bias
is if more cases were ascertained in the decade
studied owing to heightened awareness and
better diagnostic imaging.

The mutation rate is certainly higher than
previously thought,5 although there has been
no previous attempt to calculate it. Several
reports have indicated that half their cases
were sporadic: 11/15,27 22/38,28, 6/12.29 When
unbiased studies are used, where familial cases
are not specifically sought, there appears to be
good support for 50% of cases being the result
of new mutation. Although non-paternity and
non-penetrance could slightly reduce this
figure, a high mutation rate is necessary to
maintain incidence. The direct method was
considered to be accurate. The indirect method
relies heavily on the calculation of genetic
fitness. Reproductive fitness is unsuitable for
this measurement and the method of Tanaka is
not accurate enough as NF2 is a rare disease
which is not fully penetrant in early life.

In contrast to the huge families reported
from the USA,35 there were only two families
with more than five affected cases. The first
with nine known cases has been reported
before.7 The second has eight cases in three
generations, although three cases are outside
the UK. There was no strong support for
advanced paternal age as a mechanism to sup-
port the relatively high figure for mutation
rate. Further studies are certainly needed as
there was some suggestion of an effect from the
increase in expected age of the fathers of just
under a year and the skew towards the later
pregnancies in the birth order data. The figure
for mutation rate of 6-5 x 10-6 is less than that
in NFI (3-1 to 10.4 x 10-5),30 but greater than
in von Hippel-Lindau disease (4-4 x 10-6).31

There have been no previous studies that
have looked at genetic fitness. We were sur-

prised by the relatively normal level of fitness
in NF2 calculated by comparing unaffected
sibs; however, fitness is only measurable in
people old enough to be diagnosed. Early age
at onset in several cases clearly reduces fitness
but as these cases remain young their data
could not influence the calculations. Sibs may
also reduce their families voluntarily because
of the known genetic mechanism. The
methods of Tanaka'920 rely on high levels of
certainty of the diagnosis; this is approached
but certainly not complete at 15 years of age.
However, the younger cases are accounted for
and it is therefore felt to be more accurate. The
reduced fitness
in males as compared to
females could well be partially explained by
the later expected age at marriage and first
birth in males.

A maternal gene effect was first suggested by
Kanter et aF who found a significant difference
in their age of onset between maternally and
paternally inherited cases. This study which is
larger and contains more personally examined
cases confirms the results with very similar
figures. Age at onset in our maternal cases was
18-17 years compared to 18-3 years in the
study of Kanter et all and in paternal cases 24-5
as opposed to 24-1. This along with the earlier
age at death in maternal cases suggests that
gene modification by imprinting could be
involved in NF2.'2 The previous study also
in the
found a
number of cases inheriting the gene from each
parent; 25/38 cases were maternally inherited
compared to 36/56 in our study. When com-
bined, this too reaches significance (p = 0 004).
The effect could be explained to some extent
by reduced fitness in males and by some cases
of non-paternity among the sporadic cases.
However, it is possible that if an imprinting
effect is present, the later onset and possibly
non-penetrant cases of paternal origin would
be missed, although we could find no evidence
of non-penetrance in our study.

non-significant

difference

In conclusion our study has shown NF2 to
have a birth incidence of 1 in 35 000 and that
50% of cases in a given series are the result of
new mutation, with a mutation rate of
6-5 x 10-6. The study has confirmed wide
interfamilial variation in presentation of NF2,
although definition of severe and mild sub-
types on clinical criteria alone is not possible in
many cases because of overlapping features,
the situation being further complicated by the
maternal effect on disease severity. The clon-
ing of the NF2 gene is imminent and pheno-
in our large study
type-genotype studies
population will allow us to address disease
heterogeneity at a molecular level. There is no
evidence of locus heterogeneity from pub-
lished33 and unpublished (T Strachan, personal
communication) linkage studies. There is no
clear evidence of a paternal age effect on muta-
tion, but a definite maternal effect on severity.
The mechanism of mutation and the maternal
effect on disease severity will hopefully be
eludicated after the cloning of the NF2 gene.
We are grateful for the enormous help sup-
plied by clinicians throughout the UK who

have given details of patients. We would par-
ticularly like to thank Mr T T King for sup-
plying 19 cases and the Neurosurgical Unit at
the Manchester Royal Infirmary for their help
in ensuring good ascertainment.
