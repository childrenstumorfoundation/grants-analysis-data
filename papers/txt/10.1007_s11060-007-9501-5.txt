Abstract Background The role of FDG–PET for man-
aging patients with plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PN)
is
unclear. While many PN tumors exhibit periods of rapid
growth, others grow slowly or unpredictably and may have
periods of relative quiescence. The ability to predict which
PN are likely to progress should facilitate a more timely
initiation of medical
treatments. Since conventional
radiographic techniques have limited prognostic value, the
use of a functional imaging modality to predict tumor
progression is desirable. We hypothesized that PN tumors
with high metabolic activity as demonstrated by FDG–PET
are more likely to progress in the following year. Methods

All patients were clinically stable, but were considered at
high-risk for progression based on anatomical location of
PN. FDG–PET scans were performed within two weeks of
the baseline MRI study. Standardized uptake values (SUV)
were calculated for all focally active index lesions and
analyzed for correlation with changes in quantitative MRI
over the ensuing year. Results Fifteen of the 18 enrolled
patients showed various degrees of FDG uptake as focal
abnormalities, and these abnormalities corresponded to
those noted on the MRI scans. Thirteen patients and 19
lesions were evaluable for PN volume change. The SUV-
max ranged from 0.9 to 4 (median 1.5). There was a
signiﬁcant difference in the percent increase in PN volume
in the following year for lesions that had an SUV [ 2

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic dis-
order which occurs in both familial and sporadic forms.
The gene has been localized to the long arm of chromo-
some 17 (17q11.2) [1–3]. Neuroﬁbromas are the most
common tumor associated with NF1, and the plexiform
neuroﬁbroma (PN) subtype represents a major cause of
morbidity. The development of clinical trials for PN has
identiﬁed the need for a rational approach to identify those

PN likely to progress. While many lesions exhibit periods
of rapid growth, others grow slowly or inconsistently and
may have periods of relative quiescence [4]. The ability to
predict which PN will progress would improve decision
making with regard to treatment of PN and enrollment in
clinical
trials. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is primarily used to detect disease progression; and
most clinical trials are using volumetric MRI analysis to
more sensitively monitor changes in PN volume over time
[5]. However, individual MRI studies cannot be used to
predict which tumors are likely to progress. Therefore, the
identiﬁcation of physiological or biological predictors of
PN progression is crucial.

Clinically aggressive tumors often have a high meta-
bolic rate and are more likely to progress. Positron
emission tomography (PET) utilizing [18F]-2-ﬂuoro-2-
deoxyglucose (FDG) is able to detect levels of glucose
metabolism throughout
the body [6–8]. Studies of the
utility of PET in musculoskeletal tumors, including neu-
roﬁbromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,
have shown a high correlation between tumor grade and
uptake of FDG [9–12]. FDG–PET studies [13, 14] of
benign musculoskeletal tumors and optic gliomas reveal
that metabolically active lesions are more likely to pro-
gress. We, therefore, hypothesized that FDG–PET may be
an important imaging modality to differentiate benign PN
which are aggressive and will progress from those that
will stay stable. Predicting the rate of growth of these
tumors would facilitate early intervention in tumors with
a high probability of progression.

Methods

Patient population

Subjects with NF1, less than 30 years of age, without
radiographic evidence of PN progression but at high-risk
for progression as deﬁned by one of the following:

(1) Anatomic location of PN such that progression carries
impairment of function,
a high-risk of signiﬁcant
locations include
pain, or disﬁgurement. Typical
neck/mediastinum, paraspinal nerve roots, orbit, and
face.

(2) Tumors which the patient, family or caregiver believe
have increased in size during the preceding year, but
appear stable by standard clinical or radiographic
measures.

Patients with small
functional
impairment or pain and those being enrolled on a
chemotherapy trial and/or have a history of prior treatment

(\2 cm) PN without

of their PN with chemotherapy were excluded. Subjects
were recruited from the Neuro-Oncology Clinic at The
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. All patients or their
legal guardians were required to sign a document of
informed consent prior to study entry. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of The
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. No management
decisions were made based upon the PET results. No
subjects underwent biopsy during the study period.

Imaging procedures

MRI

MRI was performed soon after enrollment and one year
following the baseline examination. Multiplanar TSE T2-
weighted or short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images
were acquired and quantitative evaluation of PN size was
measured using a method of automated volumetric MRI
analysis previously described [15]. Percent change in PN
volume from baseline to follow-up scan was calculated.

FDG–PET

the intravenous

Soon after enrollment, whole body FDG–PET imaging was
performed 60 min after
injection of
0.14 mCi/kg of FDG. Emission and transmission data was
acquired with successive overlapping axial frames. Trans-
mission scans were performed for all patients to provide
attenuation correction with a 137Cs point source. Three
dimensional acquisition technique was adopted which
allows use of a lower dose of radiotracer. The ordered-
subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) method was
used to reconstruct all PET images.

Study analysis

PET qualitative evaluation

Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians blinded to
the clinical and radiological
information independently
evaluated each study. Any area of increased uptake was
identiﬁed and rated on a ﬁve point visual scale: no uptake,
uptake equal to the adjacent normal soft tissues, mildly
increased uptake, moderately increased uptake and mark-
edly increased uptake. The anatomical
location of the
lesion was recorded. If the two readers agreed in the
interpretation of the scans, the reading was considered to

J Neurooncol (2008) 87:165–171

167

be ﬁnal. If the two readers disagreed, a consensus reading
determined the ﬁnal interpretation of the scan.

PET quantiﬁcation

After image reconstruction, a region of interest (ROI) was
carefully drawn to include the entire area of abnormal FDG
uptake. Subsequently, contiguous PET scan slices were
examined and the maximum standardized uptake value
(SUVmax) was calculated. SUVmax was automatically
generated (ADACTM, Milpitas, CA) using the standard
approach by dividing the activity concentration in the
four pixels with maximum activity in the ROI drawn
around the lesion by the injected dose divided by the body
weight [16].

Statistics

FDG–PET data at study entry were analyzed for associa-
tion with changes that were detected in quantitative MRI
over the ensuing year. A Spearman correlation was cal-
culated between the baseline SUVmax and the percent
change in PN volume. In addition, a cutoff SUVmax of B2
vs. [2 was used to group the observations into low uptake
versus higher uptake (based on Ferner et al. [10]), and the
percent change in PN volume was compared between the
two groups using a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
We predicted that
tumors with a higher likelihood of
growth within one year are the ones with an SUV [ 2 at
baseline, based on data published by Ferner et al. [10]. In
their study, of ﬁfteen benign PN, ﬁve underwent a surgical
procedure. While the indication for surgery was not stated,
surgery is usually reserved for more aggressive/symptom-
atic PN. The mean SUV for lesions that were resected
(‘‘progressive’’) was 2.04 compared with 1.29 for lesions
that did not require surgery (‘‘stable’’). Of note, none of the
unresected PN increased in size during a 3–26 months
period of observation. Our study had approximately 80%
power to detect a correlation of 0.60 or higher, or to detect
a probability of 0.08 that an observation in the SUV-
max B 2 group will have a lower growth percent change in
PN volume than an observation in the SUVmax [ 2 group,
while controlling for a = .05. A P-value of 0.05 was used
to deﬁne signiﬁcance.

Results

Eighteen patients whose ages ranged from 6 to 27 years
(mean 14.4 years; only 2 patients[17 years) were enrolled
in this research study; all were considered ‘‘high-risk for

progression’’ based upon anatomic location of PN (see
‘‘Methods’’). These included nine males and nine females.
The most common sites of involvement by PN were the
face and neck (Table 1). Fifteen of 18 patients (83%)
showed various degrees of FDG uptake as focal abnor-
malities. The location of FDG–PET abnormalities in these
patients corresponded to that noted on the MR scans.
Thirteen cases and 19 lesions were evaluable for PN vol-
ume change at one year and form the basis of this report
(Table 2). Four patients were lost to follow-up and one has
not yet had quantitative MRI analysis and therefore were
not included in the ﬁnal analysis. The SUVmax was cal-
culated for all index lesions (N = 19) and values ranged
from 0.9 to 4.0 (mean 1.67, median 1.5). Most lesions had
low SUV comparable to other relatively, metabolically-
inactive low-grade soft tissue and musculoskeletal tumors
[10, 12, 17, 18], which further corroborates the benign
nature of these tumors.

We evaluated the relationship between SUV and tumor
progression by searching for the presence of both a direct
correlation as well as a threshold effect. We found a
moderate direct correlation between SUVmax and change

lation = 0.41, P = 0.083, Fig. 1). We found a signiﬁcant
difference in the percent increase in PN volume in the
following year for lesions that had an SUV [ 2 (n = 4,
median percent change = 27%) compared to those with
lower values (n = 15, median percent change = 4%)
(P = 0.016, Fig. 2). A representative case exempliﬁes the
potential usefulness of PET for evaluation and monitoring
of the patients with PN (Fig. 3).

Discussion

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PN) are the second most com-
mon complication of NF1 (after learning disabilities) [19]
with an incidence of 16.8–39% in NF1 patients [20–22].
These benign tumors are composed of axons, Schwann
cells, ﬁbroblasts, perineural cells, mast cells, collagen
ﬁbrils, and extracellular matrix. They form along branches
of nerves, nerve plexus, or spinal nerve roots, and often

techniques have limited prognostic value, the use of a
functional imaging modality to predict tumor progression
is desirable in this setting. Prior reports of FDG–PET
imaging in patients with NF1 include single case reports of
increased FDG uptake in malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (MPNST) [25–28] and a larger series (N = 16)
correlating SUV and survival in patients with MPNST [29].
Two series used FDG–PET to differentiate benign PN
from MPNST [10, 30]. Ferner et al. [10] calculated SUV
for 20 PN suspicious for malignant change and found a
signiﬁcant difference in mean SUV between the malignant
and benign tumors, although there was a range of SUV
values (2.7–3.3) where there was overlap between benign
and malignant tumors. Cardona et al. [30] examined 25
neurogenic soft tissue tumors in 13 patients (5 with NF1)
and found that FDG–PET distinguished between malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors and benign neurogenic
tumors with 100% sensitivity and 83% speciﬁcity.

Fig. 3 Subject 2. MRI (a) reveals a large plexiform neuroﬁbroma
(PN) in the right brachial plexus and a smaller PN in the left lower
neck. The intensity of [18F]-2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake
(b) is high on the right side (SUVmax = 4.0), while the lesion on the
left has relatively low uptake (SUVmax = 1.8). In the following year,
the right-sided PN progressed (increase in volume of 32%), while the
PN on the left changed minimally, consistent with a minimally active
process

involve multiple fascicles of a nerve [4]. They are at risk
for malignant degeneration to malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (8–13% lifetime risk) [23]. While malignant
transformation is rare, benign PN represent a major cause
of serious morbidity in NF1 resulting in pain, impaired
function, and disﬁgurement. They may become life-
threatening by mechanical compression of vital organs
such as the trachea, great vessels, or spinal cord, and may
signiﬁcantly interfere with normal function when located in
the extremities or orbit [22, 24].

While many PN tumors exhibit periods of rapid growth,
others grow slowly or unpredictably and may have periods
of relative quiescence. Current clinical trials for PN require
MRI evidence of increased tumor volume over a time
period of less than 12 months for enrollment. The ability to
predict which PN tumors are likely to progress should

The present investigation is the ﬁrst prospective study of
FDG–PET to evaluate PN that do not have clinical or
radiographic features generating a clinical suspicion of
malignant change. All cases had ‘‘benign’’ PN (i.e. none
were progressive at study entry or had clinical features
suggestive of malignant transformation) and were found to
have a low SUVmax at study entry. The range of SUV
values are comparable to those reported in the largest
previously published FDG–PET series with PN [10]. We
found a correlation between FDG uptake and change in PN
volume over the subsequent year. Although this correlation
is moderate within our study of 13 serially-evaluable
patients, we also acknowledge that the sample size was
modest. It is possible that with increased sample size, if the
correlation estimate holds, it will become statistically sig-
niﬁcant. Furthermore, the analysis in Fig. 2 supports that a
biologically based threshold effect exists and may be
diagnostically useful in the clinical setting.

In the future, FDG–PET may provide valuable infor-
mation to assess PN response to therapy. Because of the
variability in growth rate of PN over time, it is often dif-
ﬁcult
to determine if tumor growth arrest is due to a
therapeutic intervention or represents a spontaneous phe-
nomenon which may be noted during the natural course of
the disease. In addition, the traditional model of treatment
response deﬁned by tumor shrinkage is based on malignant
disease. In benign lesions, persistent tumor after therapy
does not always translate into inevitable progression. Sur-
rogate markers of
response which address
biological or functional changes in the tumor may have
more prognostic signiﬁcance. Studies of FDG–PET in a
variety of solid tumors demonstrate its promising role in

in tumor size and have been predictive of prolonged dis-

Conclusion

The majority of PN lesions have low FDG–PET SUV
values, consistent with the benign nature of these lesions.
Our data support the hypothesis that FDG–PET imaging
predicts PN tumor growth in patients with NF1 and,
therefore, may assist clinician decision making with regard
to treatment of PN and enrollment in clinical trials.
