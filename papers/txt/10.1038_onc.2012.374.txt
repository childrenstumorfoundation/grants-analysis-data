in Schwann cell tumors

Schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that often occur in the setting of an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome,
including neuroﬁbromatosis types 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2), familial schwannomatosis and Carney complex. Loss of the NF2 tumor
suppressor (encoding NF2, or Merlin) is associated with upregulation of the Rac1 small GTPase, which is thought to have a key role
in mediating tumor formation. In prior studies, we generated a mouse model of schwannomas by performing tissue-speciﬁc
knockout (KO) of the Carney complex gene Prkar1a, which encodes the type 1A regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. These
tumors exhibited down-regulation of Nf2 protein and an increase in activated Rac1. To assess the requirement for Rac1 in
schwannoma formation, we generated a double KO (DKO) of Prkar1a and Rac1 in Schwann cells and monitored tumor formation.
Loss of Rac1 reduced tumor formation by reducing proliferation and enhancing apoptosis. Surprisingly, the reduction of tumor
formation was accompanied by re-expression of the Nf2 protein. Furthermore, activated Rac1 was able to downregulate Nf2 in vitro
in a Pak-dependent manner. These in vivo data indicate that activation of Rac1 is responsible for suppression of Nf2 protein
production; deﬁciency of Nf2 in Schwann cells leads to loss of cellular growth control and tumor formation. Further, PKA activation
through mutation in Prkar1a is sufﬁcient to initiate Rac1 signaling, with subsequent reduction of Nf2 and schwannomagenesis.
Although in vitro evidence has shown that loss of Nf2 activates Rac1, our data indicate that signaling between Nf2 and Rac1 occurs
in a bidirectional fashion, and these interactions are modulated by PKA.

INTRODUCTION
Schwannomas are benign tumors of
the peripheral nervous
system that have been well studied because of their association
with neuroﬁbromatosis syndromes. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1
(NF1, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) #162200) and
neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) ([OMIM #101000) syndromes are
caused by inactivating mutations in the RasGAP neuroﬁbromin 1
(encoded by the NF1 gene) and ezrin–radixin–moesin family
protein neuroﬁbromin 2 (Merlin or Schwannomin, encoded by
NF2), respectively.1 In addition to these syndromes, schwannomas
are also observed in two other autosomal dominant
tumor
syndromes. Familial schwannomatosis (OMIM #162091) is caused
by mutations in the SWI/SNF complex protein SMARCB1 and is
tumors.2 Lastly, pigmented
rarely associated with non-neural
schwannomas are seen in patients with Carney complex, a tumor
predisposition bearing signiﬁcant similarities to multiple endocrine
neoplasia syndromes. Carney complex is characterized by tumors
of various endocrine glands, bone and cartilage tumors, Schwann
cell tumors and skin discoloration. This condition is caused by loss-
of-function mutations in PRKAR1A, the gene which encodes type
1A regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein
kinase, PKA. Loss of PRKAR1A causes dysregulation of PKA activity,
with elevated basal and stimulated PKA activity.3,4

variety of physiological substrates,
and 2 (Merlin).8 PKA is able to phosphorylate Merlin at Serine-518,
at Serine-10 where phosphorylation of these residues appears
to alter Merlin’s interaction with actin cytoskeleton to cause
morphologic and mobility alterations.9 Notably, the Ser-518 site
is also targeted by p21-activated kinases (PAKs).10 Phosphorylation
of Nf2 has been demonstrated for PAKs 1,2 and 6, although others
have not been tested.11 One report has suggested that PAKs are
primarily activated by Cdc42 in Schwann cells,12 although this
question has not been studied extensively. Functionally, mutation
in Nf1 leads to increased intracellular cAMP in Schwann cells13 and
increased PKA activity, which would mimic the increased PKA
activity caused by loss of Prkar1a.4

Previously, we assessed the contribution of complete loss of
Prkar1a to schwannoma formation using a tissue-speciﬁc knock-
out (KO) mouse approach. Mice carrying the conditional null allele
of Prkar1a were bred to mice of TEC3 line, which uses the
Tyrosinase promoter to drive expression of cre-recombinase in a
limited set of facial neural crest cells.14 TEC3;Prkar1aloxP/loxPmice
(henceforth called T3;R1aKO) developed facial schwannomas with
high penetrance.15 In contrast, mice with ablation throughout the
neural crest died at birth owing to craniofacial defects caused by

aberrant differentiation of the cranial neural crest.16 Prkar1a-null
loss of Nf2
schwannomas demonstrated post-transcriptional
protein. Analysis of
to lie
downstream from Nf2 showed no activation of Akt, Erk or an
increase in GTP-loaded Ras. However, study of other small
G-proteins demonstrated signiﬁcant enhancement of activated
Rac1.
Inhibition of Rac-Pak activity in conﬂuent cells has been
proposed to be one of the key means by which NF2 inhibits
proliferation of conﬂuent cells.17 Thus, based on these data, we
proposed that activation of PKA in Schwann cells (caused by loss
of Prkar1a) led to reduction in Merlin, and thence to an increase in
Rac1 activity as the key pathway in tumorigenesis.

In the present study, we sought to test the hypothesis that Rac1
is a downstream effector that is essential and is required for
Schwann cell tumorigenesis in T3;R1aKO model. To pursue this
question in vivo, we introduced a conditional null allele of Rac1
into these mice and monitored tumor formation. We report that
Rac1 KO in this setting signiﬁcantly reduces tumorigenesis.
Surprisingly, ablation of Rac1 led to re-expression of Nf2,
suggesting that there is bidirectional signaling between Nf2 and
Rac1, and these interactions are modulated by PKA. These
observations have important implications for understanding both
Schwann cell development and Schwann cell tumorigenesis.

(Figure 1). Also, the incidence of
bilateral tumors observed in Prkar1a/Rac1 DKO mice (6%) was
much lower than that observed in Het (43.6%) or wild-type (WT)
(41%) mice for Rac1. We have previously described that tumors in
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT can grow up to nearly 1.5 cm in diameter with no
signs of metastases.15 As shown in Figures 1a–f), the size of tumors
in T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO mice, whereas the T3;R1aKO;
was smaller
Rac1Het were comparable to T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT. No metastatic disease
was observed in any of the schwannoma models studied.

To conﬁrm that deletion of Rac1 allele in limited subset of facial
neural crest cells does not affect normal development, we also
generated Tec3;Rac1loxP/loxP (T3;Rac1KO) mice. These mice carried
the ROSA26lacZ reporter allele in order to conﬁrm cre expression by
LacZ staining18 (Supplementary Figure 1). Histological analysis did
not show any aberration or alteration in neural crest development
(data not shown). A cohort of mice was allowed to grow until 12
months of age. These mice were completely normal for 1 year and
did not show any phenotypic abnormality.

RESULTS
Deletion of Rac1 reduces schwannoma formation in the Prkar1a
KO model
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT mice have been previously generated in our
laboratory.15 Because the TEC3 driver expresses cre in a limited
subset of facial neural crest derivatives,14 it is highly suitable for
studying Schwann cell tumorigenesis.15 Tumors derived from
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT mice showed upregulated Rac1 activity. To assess
the requirement of Rac1 in tumorigenic process, we used TEC3 cre
line to generate mice lacking both Prkar1a and Rac1 in a subset of
facial Schwann cell.

T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO (DKO) and T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het

(heterozygous
(Het)) mice were generated by crossing T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT mice
with mice carrying a conditional null allele of Rac1. All genotypes
of mice were born at expected Mendelian frequencies (data not
shown) and allowed to age to 40 weeks, a time by which 480% of
T3;R1aKO mice developed Schwann cell tumors on the face.15
Although heterozygosity for Rac1 did not affect tumor incidence

Tumor histology
Based on guidelines for classiﬁcation of genetically engineered
tumors,19 T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors were
mouse Schwann cell
categorized previously as schwannomas given their characteristics
on S-100 immunohistochemistry.20 According to this classiﬁcation
scheme, tumors with mesenchymal, epithelial or neuroendocrine
differentiation are grade III peripheral nerve sheath tumors with
divergent differentiation. To assess histologic changes induced by
loss of Rac1, we studied a subset of tumors from each genotype at
the histopathologic level (Table 1). Of the T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors
studied, 2/6 (33%) were grade III with divergent squamous
differentiation, whereas others were classiﬁed as grade II tumors.
A similar distribution of pathology was observed in both T3;R1aKO;
Rac1KO (4/7 grade III with divergent differentiation and 3/7 grade II)
and T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het (4/6 grade III with divergent differentiation
and 2/6 grade II) tumors. Hypercellular areas were present in all
tumors; grade II tumors displayed nuclear pleomorphism and
mitoses. Thus, no signiﬁcant differences were detected in
histopathologic characterisitics of T3;R1aKO tumors, regardless of
Rac1 status.

Rac1 loss causes reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in
Schwann cell tumors
To determine the basis for reduced tumorigenesis caused by
ablation of Rac1, total mitotic ﬁgures in each representative
section of tumor were counted at  400 for group of tumors
evaluated histologically (Table 1). T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors had a
mean of 10 mitoses/h.p.f. (n¼ 6), T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het (Het) tumors
had a mean of 9 mitoses/h.p.f. (n¼ 6), and T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO (DKO)
tumors had a mean of 5.4 mitoses/h.p.f. (n¼ 7). Although these
results were consistent with the notion that T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO
tumors had a reduced mitotic count, the variability precluded
statistical signiﬁcance with these small numbers. To enhance the
analysis, we also examined tumor cell proliferation by Ki-67
staining (Figures 2a and c). In this assay, T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumor
cells had signiﬁcantly higher percentage of proliferating cells than
T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO or T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het tumors. (Po0.001).

As T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het mice did not demonstrate a clinical
reduction in tumor formation (unlike the T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO mice),
we also studied markers for apoptosis in these tumor genotypes.
Using cleaved caspase-3 as a marker
for cells undergoing
apoptosis (Figures 2b and d), abundant activated caspase-3 was
detected in T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO tumors, whereas much less was
detected in T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT (Po0.0001). As above, the difference
between T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het and T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT was noted and
found to be signiﬁcant (P¼ 0.002).

To verify these ﬁndings, a similar analysis was performed using
TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end
labeling) as an additional marker for apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure 2). There was an obvious difference between T3;R1aKO;
Rac1KO and those carrying one or
two WT alleles of Rac1
(P¼ o0.0001
vs
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors). Again, T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het tumors demon-
strated a smaller but statistically signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis
compared with T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors (P¼ 0.0031).

Loss of activated Rac1 in the tumors
Tumors from T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT mice have previously been exam-
ined for loss of Prkar1a within the tumors.15 To conﬁrm successful
excision of Rac1 in tumor cells, we measured total and activated
levels of Rac1 in tumors from T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT,
(GTP-bound)

T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het and T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO mice. As
shown in
Figure 3a, GTP-bound Rac1 was signiﬁcantly lower in T3;R1aKO;
Rac1KO tumors compared with T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT. In contrast to the
proliferation/apoptosis data,
levels of GTP-Rac1 did not appear
signiﬁcantly different between tumors Het or WT.

In these blots, we noticed that levels of total Rac1 in whole
tumor lysates remained detectable despite the almost complete
loss of GTP-bound Rac1 (Figure 3a, middle). To determine whether
this represented cross reactivity with other Rac isoforms or
represented a contribution from stromal cells within the tumor,
we analyzed Rac by immunohistochemistry using the same
antibody (Figure 3b). This analysis demonstrated that tumors
carrying one or two WT alleles for Rac1 exhibited both nuclear and
cytoplasmic staining; however, tumors with KO of Rac1 exhibited
primarily cytoplasmic staining. We interpret
this ﬁnding as
indicating that Rac identiﬁed by western blot and IHC represent
other Rac isoforms. The GTP pull-down assay demonstrates that
Rac1 was not activated in DKO tumors.

Effect of Rac1 ablation on NF2
Loss of NF2 is a common event in human schwannomas, even
those without a germline mutation in the gene.21 Consistent
with this observation in human patients, our prior work demon-
strated that ablation of Prkar1a in T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT-associated
schwannomas exhibited a post-transcriptional reduction of Nf2.15
As Rac1 is a major downstream target of NF2,22 we wanted to
determine whether ablation of Rac1 had any effects on Nf2 levels.
As an initial study, we performed immunoﬂuorescence on frozen
sections of tumors from T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT, T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het and
T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO mice. As seen previously, T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors
demonstrate minimal
if any staining for Nf2 in the tumor,
although staining is retained in the tumor capsule (Figure 4a,
left).15 Surprisingly, ablation of Rac1 led to restoration of Nf2
immunostaining in the tumor (Figure 4a, right), whereas tumors
heterozygous for Rac1 had a lower but detectable level of
immunostained Nf2 (Figure 4a, center). Positive staining in the
surrounding tumor capsule served as an internal control for Nf2
reactivity in each sample (Figure 4a, insets). In order to verify that
these changes were not artifacts of
immunoﬂuorescence, we
isolated the central region of tumor tissue from all three groups of

Our previous study demonstrated that Nf2 protein reduction in
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors was accompanied by increases in Nf2
messenger RNA (mRNA). Analysis of Rac1 KO tumors by
quantitative real-time–PCR demonstrated that levels of mRNA
varied inversely with Nf2 protein levels (Figure 4c). As previously
observed, T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors had the least Nf2 protein but
highest mRNA levels, whereas T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO had highest
protein levels with the lowest mRNA levels. Consistent with our

Rac1 downregulates Nf2 via Pak2
In order to corroborate the hypothesis that activated PKA caused
downregulation of the Nf2 protein through the activation of Rac1,
we introduced activated Rac1 into normal rat Schwann cells and
studied the effect on Nf2 protein abundance. As observed,
introduction of activated Rac1 (Rac1L61)
led to a substantial
(Figure 5a and Supplementary
decrease in Nf2 protein level
Figure 4) compared with Rac1WT. Activation of Rac1 in Schwann
cells has been proposed to affect Nf2 independently of Nf1.17 In
introduction of Rac1L61 into rat
agreement with this concept,
Schwann cells had no effect on Nf1 levels (Supplementary
Figure 5A). Similarly, although there was some variability in Nf2
expression among mouse tumors,
there was no signiﬁcant
correlation between Nf1 levels and genotype (Supplementary
Figure 5B).

Lastly, Rac1 is reported to signal through class I Paks, and this
signaling is inhibited by the Pak1 autoinhibitory domain (PID).23

To evaluate this pathway, Schwann cells were co-transfected with
Rac1L61 with or without PID. Inclusion of PID blocked the ability
of Rac1L61 to cause Nf2 downregulation (Figure 5A, right).

To understand the relation between Rac1 and Pak activation
in vivo, we studied the expression and function of Paks in normal
Schwann cells and in tumors from T3;R1aKO mice. Because mouse
Schwann cells do not proliferate in culture, we used primary
rat Schwann cells (rSCs) as a control after verifying that they
express similar levels of Paks compared with mouse Schwann
cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Analysis of rSCs by immunblot
(Figure 5b) revealed production of Paks 1, 2, 4 and 6. In tumors,
Paks 1 and 2 were expressed at levels similar to those in rSCs,
whereas Pak4 was detectable but only at low levels. Notably, there
was a marked increase in Pak6 production in tumors. At the mRNA
level (Figure 5c), Paks 1 and 2 exhibited highest level of relative
expression, with Paks 3 and 4 showing modest increases in tumors
compared with rSCs, despite low (Pak4) or undetectable (Pak3)
protein. Pak5 was not detectable at the mRNA level, and Pak6
showed an increase in mRNA, although levels were still relatively
low. Increase in Pak6 protein in the tumors appeared to be much
larger than the change in mRNA level.

As PAK protein levels may not correlate with activation status,
we performed immunoprecipitate(IP)-kinase assays for Pak iso-
forms using lysates from rSCs and six T3;R1aKO tumors (Figure 5d).
In this analysis, we observed a signiﬁcant elevation of the activity
of Pak2. Although there were small changes in the activity of other
Paks, none were signiﬁcantly different compared with rSCs. We
did not evaluate Pak3 and Pak5 because no expression was seen
at either protein or mRNA level.

Lastly, to correlate ablation of Rac1 with changes in Pak activity,
we compared the expression of Paks among T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT,
T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO and T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het tumor lysates (Figure 6a). In
this analysis, we did not observe correlation of the levels of Pak1,
2, 4 or 6 with genotype. Differences between rSCs and
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors were also observed in tumors lacking 1

or both alleles of Rac1. Because only Pak2 was activated in the
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT tumors, we repeated the analysis using lysates
from each tumor group. As shown in Figure 6b, Pak2 activity in
the T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO tumors was not different from rSCs, whereas
T3;R1aKO;Rac1WT and T3;R1aKO;Rac1Het tumors exhibited higher
activity. These data indicate that the Rac1 effect occurs through
Pak signaling, speciﬁcally Pak2, in these tumors.

DISCUSSION
Loss of PRKAR1A/Prkar1a tumor suppressor is tumorigenic in
cAMP-responsive tissues, including Schwann cells, in both humans
and mice.4,20

In this manuscript, we report the results of our investigation to
required for Prkar1a-associated
determine whether Rac1 is
Schwann cell tumorigenesis. Rac1 is known to have an important
role in normal Schwann cell function, including the regulation of
cell shape, polarity, migration, cytokinesis, gene transcription,
apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion promoting
dynamic actin remodeling,
lamellipodia formation and random
cell migration.24–28 It is also responsible for the formation of
myelin sheaths in central nervous system.29 Previous studies have
shown that conditional ablation of Rac1 in the Schwann cell
lineage affects radial sorting of axons and leads to a failure to form
lamellipodia, necessary for proper Schwann cell process extension
and stabilization.30–33
Interestingly, unlike the related small
G-protein Rho,34 Rac1 lacks PKA phosphorylation sites. Although
it has been suggested that integrin signaling may mediate PKA-
Rac crosstalk,35 there is no known mechanism by which activation
of PKA directly enhances Rac1 activity.

On the basis of this fact and prior reports that Nf2 serves as a
negative regulator of Rac1 function,22,36,37 we hypothesized that
ablation of Rac1 from Prkar1a KO Schwann cell tumors would
reduce tumor formation by reducing a key signaling mechanism
downstream from Nf2.

Initial studies linking Rac1 and Nf2 showed that cells lacking Nf2
have increased levels of activated Rac1, as judged primarily by
increases in downstream targets.22 The same phenomenon was
observed in lysates from human schwannomas.38 Prior data has
suggested that either Rac-activated Pak or cAMP-activated PKA
can phosphorylate Nf2 on Ser518 and that this modiﬁcation
abrogates Nf2’s normal growth suppressive ability.8,39

Although ablation of Rac1 did, in fact, reduce tumor formation,
our data suggest that the interplay between PKA, Rac1 and Nf2
in vivo appears to be more complex. Schwann cell tumors with
activated PKA (caused by ablation of Prkar1a) do not exhibit
hyperphosphorylated Nf2; rather, Nf2 protein is lost from tumors.
When Rac1 was knocked out of these tumors, Nf2 was restored in
the tumors that developed, suggesting that PKA’s effects are
indirect and are mediated through Rac1 activation. Thus, Rac1’s
ability to promote Schwann cell tumors may rely on its ability
to suppress Nf2 protein abundance, rather than altering Nf2
function. This effect does not appear
to be mediated by
alterations in Nf2 phosphorylation. When re-expression of Nf2 in
the double KO tumors occurs, it causes decreased proliferation
and enhanced apoptosis, consistent with previous reports where
both decreased proliferation40,41 and increased apoptosis42,43
were observed in Schwann cells transduced with Nf2.

The mechanism by which activation of Rac1 leads to down-
regulation of Nf2 at the protein level remains obscure. Proteaso-
mal degradation of mutant Nf2 isoforms has previously been
demonstrated.44 Efforts to demonstrate enhanced proteasomal
degradation of Nf2 in Prkar1a-null Schwann cells have not
recapitulated this observation (GNJ and LSK, unpublished
observations). However, these studies may have been limited by
the choice of cell line, as Rac1L61 induced Nf2 degradation, but
only in primary cells. Alternatively, degradation of Nf2 may occur
via other means yet to be identiﬁed. Other possibilities exist,
including induction of microRNAs targeted to Nf245 or the direct
inhibition of translation of the mRNA. Efforts to deﬁne this
mechanism are currently underway.

PKA-mediated activation of Rac1 suppresses Nf2
PK Manchanda et al

appears to be mediated by activation of Rac1 in this tissue. Our
data indicate that the Rac1 effect is mediated by Type I Paks speci-
ﬁcally Pak2. These data should lead to an enhanced understanding
of the regulation of Nf2 in vivo, and suggests that inhibition of Rac1
or Pak2 may be a viable therapy for treating Schwann cell tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse experiments
All genetically modiﬁed animals were maintained in a sterile environment
with 12-h light/dark cycles under the highest standards of ethical care
under an IACUC-approved protocol. Derivation of TEC3,14 Prkar1aloxP 20 and
Rac1loxP 47 has previously been described. TEC3;Prkar1aloxP/loxPmice (T3;R1aKO
or T3;R1aKO;RacWT) were designated TEC3KO in our previous paper.15
TEC3;Prkar1aloxP/loxP;Rac1loxP/loxP (T3;R1aKO;RacKO) and TEC3;Prkar1aloxP/loxP;
Rac1loxP/ þ (T3;R1aKO;RacHet) were generated by mating of appropriate
straints. TEC3;Rac1KO mice were also generated as a control group.
(n¼ 36) and
T3;R1aKO;RacKO (n¼ 52) animals were monitored weekly for tumor onset,
which was deﬁned as the age at which a tumor of 0.5-cm linear dimension
(as measured by calipers) was ﬁrst detected. Mice with bilateral tumors
were designated as having tumor onset at time the ﬁrst tumor reached
0.5 cm.

In this study, T3;R1aKO;RacWT (n¼ 85), T3;R1aKO;RacHet

Rac1 activation assays
Active Rac1 was afﬁnity precipitated using PAK1-PBD, separated by
SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Rac1 antibody according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, cat #17-441).
Activity assays were performed on ﬁve tumors of each genotype.
Total Rac1 was measured from corresponding whole tumor
lysates
normalized to b-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as loading
control. Quantitation of blots was determined using Genetools imaging
software (Spectronics Corporation, Westbury, NY, USA).

Western blot
Proteins from tumors were homogenized and lysed under non-denaturing
conditions (Cell lysis buffer, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Samples
were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the following
antibodies: PAK1 (#2602), PAK2 (#2608), PAK3 (#2609) and PAK4 (#3242)
(CST, Danvers, MA, USA); NF1 (sc-67), NF2 (sc-331), PAK5 (sc-22156), PAK6
(H-300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and b-Actin
(Sigma-Aldrich).

Histology
In order to visualize cre activity using LacZ staining, mice were bred to
carry the ROSA26lacZ allele.48 Pups at postnatal day 2 (P2) were sacriﬁced
and heads washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Whole-mount X-gal
staining was performed as described.49 Heads were visualized under
dissecting microscope and images taken using Zeiss digital camera with
Axio Vision 4.3 software (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Specimens
were dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁn. Sections were cut through
trigeminal ganglion and visualized and images captured under a
microscope (Olympus BX50, Center Valley, PA, USA) with Spot Basic v4.1
software (Spot Imaging Solutions, Sterling Heights, MI, USA).

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H/E) staining was performed using Leica
autostainer (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA). Alcian blue
staining was performed manually in 1% Alcian blue (Sigma-Aldrich)
prepared in 0.1 N HCl
for 30 min. Nuclei were counterstained using
Nuclear Fast Red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, then sections were dehydrated
and cover-slipped.

Immunoﬂuorescence/Immunohistochemistry (IF/IHC)
For IF, freshly dissected tumor tissues were frozen in Tissue Tek Optimal
Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrence, CA,
USA). 5 mm sections were ﬁxed using cold acetone and permeabilized in
0.1% sodium citrate with 0.1% Triton-X100 detergent (Sigma-Aldrich).
Primary antibody was prepared in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-
buffered saline. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 1C
overnight, washed and incubated with Alexaﬂuor-488 conjugated second-
ary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 25 min in dark. Samples were then washed,

and for T3;R1aKO;Rac1KO vs rSC. A full colour version of this ﬁgure
is available at the Oncogene journal online.

Our observations regarding Paks also merit mention. Regardless
of mechanism, our data strongly indicate that Pak2 is the Pak
isoform downstream from Rac1, which mediates Rac1’s ability to
downregulate Nf2. This effect is speciﬁc for Nf2, as Nf1 is not
affected by modulation of Rac1-Pak signaling. More intriguing is
the relative lack of correspondence between Pak isoform mRNA,
protein and activity levels (Figure 5). These studies highlight the
need to speciﬁcally investigate these kinases at functional level,
and not solely through mRNA or protein abundance. It is possible
that the same intracellular pathways causing dissociation between
Nf2 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4) have this same effect on
Paks, especially Paks 4 and 6. Despite high levels of Pak6 in
tumors, we do not observe activation of this kinase, and its
function in schwannomas remains obscure. Recent data suggest
that Pak6 can phosphorylate and inactivate the proapoptotic
protein, Bad, in prostate cancer cells.46 However, this mechanism
may not be applicable to schwannomas, which show increased
levels of apoptosis in DKO tumors despite high levels of Pak6.

In conclusion, KO of PRKAR1A/Prkar1a in the Schwann cell
lineage leads to loss of Nf2 at protein level and that this loss

mounted with DAPI mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA),
and visualized using Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH) and
Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss GmbH).

For IHC, samples were ﬁxed overnight in 10% formalin, processed and
embedded in parafﬁn.
IHC was developed by adding DAB chromogen
reagent (Vector Labs) to each section for 1–2 min before counterstaining
with hematoxylin, dehydration and cover-slipping. Following antibodies
were used: Cleaved caspase-3 (CST#9661), Ki67 (Clone TEC-3, DAKO,
Carpinteria, CA, USA). TUNEL staining was performing using a commercial
kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (#L00297, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ,
USA). For Rac1 IHC, we used the same antibodies as for Rac1 pull down.
Samples were analyzed on an Olympus BX50 microscope, and images
captured using Spot Basic v4.1 software.

Quantitative real-time–PCR
RNA was isolated from mouse tumors and converted to cDNA with BioRad
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). cDNA
was subject to quantitative real-time–PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
Kit (BioRad) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Expression data were
pooled for all experiments to derive the data presented. Reactions were
each performed in triplicate. Primers are previously described.15

Cell culture and transfection
Primary rSCs were isolated from neonatal
rat pups using standard
methods.50 pRK5-myc-Rac1-wt and pRK5-myc-Rac1-Q61L (constitutively
active) plasmids were generated in lab of Dr Gary Bokoch and obtained
from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA; plasmids 12985 and 12983,
respectively). The PID construct has been described23 and was gracious
gift of Dr Jonathan Chernoff. Cells transfections were performed with
Amaxa Nucleofector using reagents from manufacturer (Rat Neural Stem
Cell Nucleofector Kit from Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA).

PAK IP-kinase assay
Two hundred micrograms of protein was used as starting material to IP
each Pak isoform for subsequent kinase activity assays. For our initial
studies, we used lysates from rSCs and six TEC3KO tumors for analysis. For
comparison among tumors from T3;R1aKO;RacWT, T3;R1aKO;RacHet and
T3;R1aKO;RacKO mice, three independent tumors were analyzed. In brief,
samples were pre-cleared with 1.0 mg rabbit IgG prior to IP, and the
antibodies used for PAK were same as those used for western blots.
Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to pull down the
IgG-Pak complexes, which were subsequently resuspended in and equal
volume of 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma-Aldrich). Kinase assays
were performed by adding 3  hot mix containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5),
10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM ATP and 10 mCi per reaction with g-32P ATP. Samples
were incubated at 30 1C for 30 min and then 10 ml of each reaction was
spotted on P81 paper (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Counts per minute
were read on scintillation counter, and samples normalized to background
readings from negative controls. Each sample was tested in triplicate for
kinase activity to control for variability.

Statistics
Tumor onset was analyzed by generation of Kaplan–Meier curves. On the
basis of the tumor-free survival curve shown, we used a double-sided log-
rank test at a¼ 0.05 to compare time with tumor onset of the TEC3KO mice
(as the ‘baseline’) with other mice. Unpaired t-tests were used for all other
analyses assuming Gaussian populations with a 95% conﬁdence interval.
Data are presented as mean±s.e. Differences were analyzed with
Student’s t-test, and signiﬁcance set at Po0.05.
