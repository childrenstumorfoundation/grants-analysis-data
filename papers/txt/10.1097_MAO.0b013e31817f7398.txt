Objective: To analyze the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce
the growth of vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts.
Methods: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established
in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a
small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibi-
tor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received
bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a
longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive
trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo
for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic reso-
nance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death was
analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferaseYmediated
dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA.
Results: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted mag-
netic resonance imaging sequences. Trastuzumab significantly
reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared with control

Conclusion: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors tras-
tuzumab and erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in
nude mice, raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in

Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) result from mutations
in the tumor suppressor gene merlin or schwannomin
and occur in 2 forms; sporadic, isolated tumors and bilat-
eral tumors occurring in patients with the genetic disease
neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) (1Y4). Current manage-
ment of VSs is limited to observation with serial imaging,
stereotactic radiosurgery, or radiotherapy, and microsur-
gical removal (5Y8). Although these therapies are gener-
ally well tolerated, they occasionally result in deafness,
facial paralysis, spinal fluid leak, continued tumor growth,
or even malignant transformation (9Y14). Vestibular
schwannomas arising in patients with NF2 are particu-
larly difficult to manage (15). Most patients develop deaf-
ness and other cranial and spinal neuropathies, and many

die as a result of their disease (16). The discovery of alter-
native therapies that limit the growth of schwannomas
may be of particular benefit to patients with NF2 (4,15,17).
Understanding the role of the merlin protein in
Schwann cell (SC) homeostasis should help guide the
development of alternative therapies for patients with
schwannomas (3,4). Merlin mediates contact inhibition
of cell growth and suppresses the activity of intracel-
lular signaling cascades implicated in tumor formation
in many cells, including RasYmitogen-activated protein
kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinaseY
ERK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt, and c-Jun N-
terminal kinase (18Y24).

In addition to these intracellular kinases, merlin regu-
lates the subcellular localization and activity of receptor
tyrosine kinases (25), including the epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor, or ErbB, family of tyrosine kinases (26). Like
their SC counterparts, VS cells uniformly express ErbB2
and ErbB3, with a subset also expressing epidermal
growth factor receptor or ErbB1 and ErbB4 (27Y29). A
recent study found increased mRNA expression for ErbB1

and ErbB2 in most VSs, and that ErbB1 expression levels
correlate with tumor size (30). In normal SCs, merlin is
implicated in the cytoplasmic sequestration of ErbB2 in
response to cell-cell contact (26). However, in VS cells,
ErbB2 constitutively resides in portions of the cell mem-
brane known as lipid rafts and is active (28,29). This lipid
raft localization of ErbB2 in VS cells mirrors the movement
of ErbB2 into lipid rafts in proliferating, denervated SCs
after axotomy (31). Thus, ErbB receptors represent a poten-
tial target for therapies to limit VS growth (27Y30,32).
Given their involvement in a number of different tumors,
several ErbB inhibitors have been developed and are used
clinically (33).

Here, we tested the efficacy of 2 ErbB inhibitors on VS
growth in a xenograft model of human VSs using nude mice.
We report that trastuzumab, a humanized anti-ErbB2
monoclonal antibody, and erlotinib, an inhibitor of
ErbB1 and ErbB2 kinase activity (34), both reduce the
growth of VS xenografts as measured by magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) during a 3-month interval. Erlotinib,
but not trastuzumab, resulted in increased VS cell death in
these xenografts. Thus, ErbB inhibitors serve as potential
novel therapies for the treatment of schwannomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

VS Xenografts

Xenografts were developed in male athymic Ncr Nu/Nu mice
(National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Be-
thesda, MD, USA) from VS specimens derived from 4 separate
patients. All patients provided written, informed consent for use
of tumor harvested at time of surgery. The institutional review
board at the University of Iowa approved the study protocol, and
the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee approved all animal protocols. Mice were housed in a
barrier room and watered and fed rodent chow freely.

Acutely resected VS specimens were transported to the labora-
tory in ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution (Invitrogen, Cals-
bad, CA, USA), cut into approximately 10-mm3 fragments, and
placed into the interscapular fat pad in nude mice anesthetized
with ketamine (100 mg/kg; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg; Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO, USA).
The grafts were allowed to develop for 4 weeks before initiating
any treatment.

Measurement of Tumor Volume

Tumor volume was analyzed by MRI. Mice were removed
from the barrier facility and imaged in a small-animal MRI (Var-
ian Unity/INOVA 4.7-T scanner; Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA,

USA). T2-Weighted images were acquired in the axial and sagit-
tal planes by placing an anesthetized mouse inside a 37.5-mm-
diameter transmit/receive volume coil. Slice thickness was
0.5 mm in each plane. To calculate the tumor volume, the surface
area of the tumor on each sequential image was analyzed using
the measurement tool on Image J software (National Institutes of
Health) by drawing a region of interest encompassing the tumor.
The reviewer was blinded to the experimental group. The mea-
surements were repeated 3 times in both the axial and sagittal
planes, and the average tumor surface area was multiplied by the
slice thickness (0.5 mm) to calculate the slice volume. Slice
volumes were halved for the initial and final slices of each imag-
ing series. Slice volumes were then summed for total tumor
volume. We also calculated total tumor volumes using the entire
volume of the initial and final slices for each series. This did not
affect the overall results of the experiments. To calculate the
relative tumor growth, the initial tumor volume (Vi) was sub-
tracted from the final tumor volume (Vf), and the difference
was divided by Vi ([Vf j Vi] / Vi) to account for differences in
initial xenograft volumes. There was no significant difference in
the relative tumor growth rates of the trastuzumab control and
erlotinib control animals, and the data from these animals were
pooled.

Treatment With ErbB Inhibitors

A total of 19 mice bearing human VS xenografts derived from
4 separate patients were analyzed in this study. The Table 1
presents the distribution of VS specimens used for these studies.
In a preliminary experiment, 4 mice were implanted with VSs
derived from 2 patients and were randomly divided into 2 groups
4 weeks after tumor implantation. Two mice received trastuzu-
mab (25 mg/kg in 0.25 ml isotonic sodium chloride solution, i.p.;
Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) 3 times per week for
2 weeks, whereas 2 animals received saline injections. During
the final week of treatment, all mice were injected with bromo-
deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) daily to label dividing cells. After the 2-week treat-
ment interval, the xenografts were harvested and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich).

For the longer-term experiment, the xenografts were derived
from 2 additional VSs, and initial MRIs were obtained 4 weeks
after tumor implantation. After the initial MRI, the mice were
returned to a quarantine room, where they were randomly
divided into 3 groups of 5 animals each (15 total). One group
received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 times per week. This is
similar to trastuzumab doses shown to inhibit growth of xeno-
grafts derived from human carcinomas that overexpress ErbB2
(35,36). The second group was gavage-fed erlotinib (50 mg/kg;
Genentech) 5 days a week. This is similar to erlotinib doses
shown to reduce growth of xenografts derived from nonYsmall
cell lung cancer and malignant nerve sheath tumors (37,38).
Erlotinib was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose
(MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and 0.4% Tween-80

(Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The final group of
mice served as controls. In this group, 3 animals were gavage-
fed erlotinib vehicle, and 2 animals received saline injections for
trastuzumab control. Treatment continued for 12 weeks. After
completion of the treatment, the mice were once again imaged to
analyze final tumor volume, and the xenografts were harvested
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

After fixation, the xenografts were washed in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The
samples were then embedded in optimum cutting temperature
compound (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
and cryosectioned at 10 to 15 Km. Frozen sections from the
preliminary group of animals were treated with 2N HCl for 30
minutes, permeabilized with 0.8% Triton-X100 in PBS for
20 minutes, and then blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat
serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.8% Triton-X100) for
30 minutes. Next, the samples were incubated in mouse mono-
clonal anti-BrdU (1:800; Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti-S100
(1:800; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at

C. After several washes in PBS, secondary antibodies (anti-
mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and antirabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:800
each; Invitrogen) diluted in PBS were applied for 1 hour at room
temperature. Nuclei were then labeled with Hoechst 3342
(10 Kg/ml; Invitrogen) for 10 minutes, and the slides were
mounted and coverslipped. Frozen sections from the longer-
term groups of animals were labeled with anti-S100 antibody
as previously discussed. After immunostaining, terminal deox-
ynucleotidyl transferaseYmediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of
fragmented DNA (TUNEL) was performed as previously
described (39), and the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 3342.
Digital images were captured on a Leica DMIRE2 epifluorescence
microscope (Bannockburn, IL, USA) equipped with a charge-
coupled device camera and Leica FW4000 software.

Determination of Cell Proliferation and Cell Death
Cell proliferation was analyzed by assaying BrdU uptake
in xenograft frozen sections as previously described (31).
The number of BrdU-positive S100-positive cells was ana-
lyzed from digital images from 5 randomly selected 30
108 VS cell nuclei per 30 field;
microscopic fields (331
standard deviation [SD]) for each of 3 frozen sections
mean
per xenograft (fifteen 30 microscopic fields per xenograft).
The average percentage of BrdU-positive VS cells was ana-
lyzed for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded to treat-
ment conditions.

xenografts remained viable and were capable of dividing.
We also tested the efficacy of trastuzumab to reduce VS
cell proliferation in these xenografts because it has
already been shown to reduce VS cell proliferation in
vitro (29). Xenografts were allowed to establish for
4 weeks in 4 nude mice. Figure 1 shows representative
MRI of xenografts 4 weeks after transplantation. Figure 1
also shows a frozen section immunolabeled with the SC
marker anti-S100 antibody and Hoechst (nuclear stain).
This section was taken from the edge of the graft to illus-
trate the specificity of S100 immunolabeling for viable
tumor cells compared with the cells comprising the tumor
capsule that fail to label with anti-S100 antibody.

After 4 weeks, the animals were randomly assigned to
receive trastuzumab (25 mg/kg 3 times a week for 2 wk;
2 animals) or saline injections (2 control animals). All
animals were also injected with BrdU daily for the final
7 days before being killed to allow identification of
dividing cells. Cell proliferation was analyzed by count-
ing the number of BrdU-positive, S100-positive VS cell
nuclei from frozen sections (Fig. 2). The results represent
the average percentage of BrdU-positive VS cells for

Tumor Response to ErbB Inhibitors

Having demonstrated that the xenografts remained
viable 4 weeks after implantation and that we can image
them with MRI, we performed a second experiment with
a separate group of 15 animals to analyze if ErbB in-
hibition can reduce the growth of the xenografts. Initial
MRIs were taken 4 weeks after implantation (Fig. 1). The
animals were then randomized to receive trastuzumab,
erlotinib, or placebo (the carrier compounds for the phar-
maceutical agents) for 12 weeks. After treatment, the ani-
mals were reimaged, and the xenografts were harvested to
evaluate for cell death. One tumor in the erlotinib-treated
group did not appear on the final MRI.

DISCUSSION

In this preliminary study involving a small cohort of
animals, we demonstrate that ErbB inhibitors reduce the
growth of VS xenografts. These encouraging results need
to be replicated with tumors derived from a larger group
of patients and in other models of VS disease. Never-
theless, they identify a systemic therapy capable of redu-
cing VS growth in vivo and are particularly relevant to
patients with NF2 who often have multiple cranial and
spinal neuropathies due to schwannoma growth.

In this study, we did not screen the tumors for merlin
mutations, and thus, it is not possible to analyze if the
effects observed here are mutation specific (40Y43).
Likewise, the expression of ErbB receptors was not ana-
lyzed in these tumors because the entire xenograft speci-
men was consumed in cell proliferation and death
analyses. However, several studies confirm that VSs uni-
versally express both ErbB2 and ErbB3, similar to their
SC counterparts (27Y30,32). Significantly, ErbB2 is acti-
vated in VSs and drives cell proliferation (27Y29,32).
The extent of ErbB1 and ErbB4 expression in VSs is
less clear, yet a recent study suggests that ErbB1 expres-
sion correlates with tumor size (30).

Models of Vestibular Schwannomas and NF2 Disease
Representative models to evaluate therapeutic agents
for VSs and NF2 are lacking. Several investigators have
developed VS xenograft models (44Y47). In general,
these tumors grow very slowly, mimicking their behavior
in patients (7,48). Similarly, in our study, control tumors
demonstrated slight growth during a 3-month interval.
Thus, sophisticated and sensitive imaging modalities
are required to detect small differences in tumor growth
(44). Here, we used T2-weighted MRI sequences that
were able to clearly delineate tumor volumes.

Transgenic animals represent an alternative model of
NF2 disease. Heterozygous mice carrying germline muta-
tions in merlin (Nf2j/Nf2+) develop osteosarcomas and
liver tumors but fail to develop schwannomas (49,50).
Mice carrying biallelic-targeted deletion of merlin exon
2 in SCs develop SC hyperplasia and peripheral nerve
schwannomas that can be imaged with MRI, representing
a potential model to evaluate therapies aimed at reducing
schwannoma formation or growth (51Y53). However,
these mice do not seem to develop VSs. Cell cultures
allow for higher throughput screening and complement
animal models. Of particular relevance to the results of
these experiments, trastuzumab reduces cell proliferation
in primary VS cultures derived from human patients (29).
In addition to tumor imaging, we also analyzed the pro-
liferative capacity of VS cells in these xenografts. Consis-
tent with their slow growth rates, we found that only 0.2%
of VS cells incorporated BrdU in control animals treated
with daily doses of BrdU for 7 days. By comparison, ap-
proximately 0.5% of denervated eighth-nerve SCs in rats
incorporate BrdU after 4 systemic doses (Provenzano
et al., unpublished data), suggesting that the proliferative
rate of VS cells is somewhat comparable to that of dener-
vated SCs. This low proliferative rate is consistent with
the slow tumor growth observed on MRI and with the
clinical behavior of most VSs in humans.

Potential Therapies for NF2

Understanding the cellular and molecular events con-
tributing to schwannoma formation and growth will help
guide the development of novel therapies. Recent studies
have identified many of the signaling molecules that are
regulated by merlin and are implicated in tumor formation.
In particular, several intracellular kinases are inhibited by

merlin, including ERK, Akt, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and
p21-activated kinase (18Y24) Because dysregulated activ-
ity of these kinases contributes to neoplasia, several inhibi-
tory reagents have been developed and represent potential
therapies for VSs (54).

In addition to intracellular kinases, activation of ErbB2,
a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for SC development,
proliferation, and survival, seems to contribute to SC neo-
plasia, including VSs (27Y29,32,55Y58). The contribution
of ErbB family members to neoplasia in general is well
established, and many molecules that inhibit ErbB family
members are used clinically in the management of breast,
head and neck, lung, central nervous system, and other
malignancies (59). In general, these ErbB inhibitors display
fewer side effects than cytotoxic agents and may be more
suitable for long-term therapy as would likely be required in
NF2 patients (33).

The purpose of this preliminary study was to vali-
date the xenograft model of VS and the general ability of
ErbB inhibitors to reduce tumor growth. It was not de-
signed to evaluate the relative efficacy of different ErbB
inhibitors, which will require a much larger sample of ani-
mals to analyze dose-response relationships. However, the
observation that both ErbB inhibitors reduced tumor
growth provides encouragement that targeting these mole-
cules may prove effective.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have shown that trastuzumab and
erlotinib reduced the growth of VS xenografts. Although
the growth of tumors was very slow, we were able to de-
tect small differences in tumor growth using MRI and
complement the imaging studies with assays of cell
proliferation and death. These results raise the possi-
bility of using ErbB inhibitors as systemic therapy to
limit schwannoma growth in patients with NF2 or those
unsuitable for current therapies.
