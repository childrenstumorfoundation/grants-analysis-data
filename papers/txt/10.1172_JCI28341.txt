Neurofibromatosis	type	I	(NF1;	also	known	as	von	Recklinghausen’s	disease)	is	a	common	autosomal-
dominant	condition	primarily	affecting	neural	crest–derived	tissues.	The	disease	gene,	NF1,	encodes	neu-
rofibromin,	a	protein	of	over	2,800	amino	acids	that	contains	a	216–amino	acid	domain	with	Ras–GTPase-
activating	protein	(Ras-GAP)	activity.	Potential	therapies	for	NF1	currently	in	development	and	being	
tested	in	clinical	trials	are	designed	to	modify	NF1	Ras-GAP	activity	or	target	downstream	effectors	of	
Ras	signaling.	Mice	lacking	the	murine	homolog	(Nf1)	have	mid-gestation	lethal	cardiovascular	defects	
due	to	a	requirement	for	neurofibromin	in	embryonic	endothelium.	We	sought	to	determine	whether	
the	GAP	activity	of	neurofibromin	is	sufficient	to	rescue	complete	loss	of	function	or	whether	other	as	
yet	unidentified	functions	of	neurofibromin	might	also	exist.	Using	cre-inducible	ubiquitous	and	tissue-
specific	expression,	we	demonstrate	that	the	isolated	GAP-related	domain	(GRD)	rescued	cardiovascular	
development	in	Nf1–/–	embryos,	but	overgrowth	of	neural	crest–derived	tissues	persisted,	leading	to	peri-
natal	lethality.	These	results	suggest	that	neurofibromin	may	possess	activities	outside	of	the	GRD	that	
modulate	neural	crest	homeostasis	and	that	therapeutic	approaches	solely	aimed	at	targeting	Ras	activity	
may	not	be	sufficient	to	treat	tumors	of	neural	crest	origin	in	NF1.

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common 
monogenetic disorders, affecting 1 in 3,500 individuals (1). The 
effects of NF1 are seen in nearly all parts of the body, such as 
learning disabilities (2, 3), skeletal dysplasias (4), vascular abnor-
malities such as moya-moya and renovascular hypertension (1, 5), 
and cardiac abnormalities such as valvar pulmonary stenosis (1, 
6). However, the most prominent clinical symptoms affect tissues 
of neural crest origin (7), such as the peripheral nervous system 
and melanocytes, with clinical manifestations such as neurofibro-
mas, axillary freckling, and café-au-lait spots. More ominously, 
NF1 patients are also at risk for the development of life-threat-
ening malignancies such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumors (MPNSTs) (4, 8), central nervous system gliomas (9), and 
myeloid leukemia (10, 11).

Neurofibromin,  the  protein  encoded  by  the  disease  gene 
NF1, is composed of 2,818 amino acids, most of which are of 
unknown function. A small, 216–amino acid domain of neuro-
fibromin, the GTPase-activating protein–related (GAP-related) 
domain (GRD), bears strong sequence homology to mammalian 
and yeast Ras-GAPs (12) and is able to hydrolyze GTP-bound 
Ras to GDP-bound Ras, thus reducing Ras activity. This down-
regulation of active Ras is thought to account for the tumor 
suppressor function of neurofibromin (13). Mutations affecting 
the Ras-GAP activity of neurofibromin have been identified in 

Nonstandard	abbreviations	used: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GRD, GAP-

NF1 patients and NF1-related malignancies (14–16), and down-
stream effectors of Ras signaling are activated in these cells. In 
particular, the demonstration of clinical NF1 in a family with a 
point mutation in the GRD leading to the specific loss of Ras-
GAP activity without marked disruption of the protein struc-
ture suggests the necessity of this domain for tumor suppres-
sor function (15). Further, reconstitution of Ras-GAP function 
through GRD expression rescues the growth abnormalities of 
Nf1–/– cultured hematopoietic stem cells, neural stem cells, and 
embryonic fibroblasts in vitro (17, 18).

On the other hand, large regions of the NF1 coding sequence 
have been conserved across millions of years of evolution from 
Drosophila to man, suggesting significant functions outside the 
GRD (19). In Drosophila, neurofibromin can function to modu-
late adenylate cyclase activity, and this function has been dem-
onstrated in mammalian cell systems (19–22). Numerous muta-
tions outside the GRD, which do not appear to affect protein 
stability or GAP function, have been correlated with human dis-
ease (23, 24). Neurofibromin has been found to associate with 
cytoskeletal proteins (25), and studies in cultured cells suggest 
that the GAP activity of neurofibromin does not account for 
NF1-dependent changes in cell adhesion and some aspects of 
MAPK signaling (22).

Despite these conflicting bodies of evidence concerning the 
relative importance of neurofibromin GAP activity, therapeutic 
approaches for the treatment of NF1-related tumors have focused 
on the Ras-GAP activity of neurofibromin and have sought to nor-
malize elevated Ras activity levels. For example, clinical trials for 
the treatment of NF1-related malignancies, such as MPNSTs, with 
farnesyltransferase inhibitors are underway (26). However, initial 
results have not shown marked effects (27), and these approaches 
may not effectively target activated Ras (28–30).

gesting that overexpression of HA-GRD is well tolerated.

Next, we established appropriate matings to generate Nf1–/– 
mice that also expressed HA-GRD ubiquitously. We utilized CMV 
promoter–mediated cre expression by crossing Nf1+/–, HA-GRDk/+ 
with Nf1+/–, CMV-cre+ mice. Nf1–/– embryos die at mid-gestation 
with cardiovascular defects and are not identified beyond E13.5 
(34, 35). Prior to this embryonic stage, we had not observed any 
alterations from expected Mendelian ratios. At E12.5, we har-
vested embryos and measured total and activated Ras. Active Ras 
was elevated in Nf1–/– embryos and returned to wild-type levels by 
expression of HA-GRD (Figure 2B).

Results
We have generated a tractable mouse model that allows for acti-
vation and functional expression of the isolated neurofibromin 
GRD in a tissue-specific fashion. Using homologous recombina-
tion in embryonic stem cells, we inserted a HA-tagged human NF1 
GRD coding sequence (HA-GRD) into the ROSA26 locus (31, 32) 
downstream of a floxed PGK-neo cassette, designated HA-GRDk/+. 
The insert was not expressed unless cre-mediated recombination 
removed the neo cassette and allowed for HA-GRD expression 
(Figure 1A). We demonstrated appropriate targeting by Southern 
blotting (Figure 1B) and cre-dependent expression of HA-GRD in 
mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 1C).

The isolated HA-GRD displays properties consistent with Ras-
GAP activity both in vitro and in vivo. Using a related cre-activated 
plasmid to express HA-GRD in Cos cells (pCCALL2–HA-GRD), we 
showed that cre-mediated expression of GRD reduced Ras-GTP 
levels (Figure 2A). We crossed HA-GRDk/+ mice with CMV-cre+ mice, 
which express cre recombinase ubiquitously (33). Offspring were

and wild-type Ras (WT Ras). Cells with wild-type Ras were also trans-
fected with an expression construct for HA-GRD (WT Ras + NF1 GRD).

vated mTOR, s6K, and s6RP. eIF4E served as a loading control.

AAll 5 rescued pups succumbed during the first postnatal day.

tem tumors (36, 37), we found that Nf1 deficiency was associat-
ed with downregulation of phosphorylated (activated) mamma-
lian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream signaling 
effectors s6 kinase (s6K) and s6 ribosomal protein (s6RP) in the 
developing embryo. In mice, these activities were returned to 
wild-type levels by expression of HA-GRD (Figure 2C). In cul-
tured cells and some tissues, abnormal activation of mTOR and 
its downstream effectors has been reported upon loss of Nf1 (36, 
37), while our results demonstrated abnormal downregulation 
of these same pathways. This discrepancy may reflect the differ-
ences between acute and chronic Ras dysregulation in some tis-
sues. They may also be the result of differences in the nature of 
these pathways in oncologic and developmental contexts. Fur-
thermore, our results could reflect secondary changes in tissues 
other than those primarily affected by loss of neurofibromin. 
Contextually divergent regulatory mechanisms and their resul-
tant feedback controls may result in disparate findings in cell 
culture, in tumors, and in embryos. Outlining and understand-
ing these differences will be important for future investigation.

(Figure 3). Histological examination of rescued newborns revealed 
normal cardiac anatomy (data not shown). All examined rescued 
pups, however, showed striking, tumor-like overgrowth of neu-
ral crest–derived structures. Compared with Nf1+/– littermates  
(Figure 4A), the neural crest–derived adrenal medulla in Nf1–/–, 
HA-GRDk/+, CMV-cre+ mice was significantly enlarged (Figure 4B).  
This enlargement was similar to what we have observed with 
mice with neural crest–specific Nf1 inactivation (Figure 4C) (38). 
Enormous paraspinal masses arising from the dorsal root gan-
glia were also evident in all rescued pups (compare Figure 4, E 
and G, with Figure 4D). These findings were almost identical to 
those that we have previously described in newborn pups with 
neural crest–specific inactivation of Nf1 (38). Like HA-GRD res-
cued Nf1–/– pups, neural crest–specific Nf1 knockout mice died 
at birth, with dramatic overgrowth of neural crest structures  
(Figure 4, C and F). Hence, ubiquitous expression of HA-GRD 
failed to rescue the phenotype of neurofibromin loss in neural 
crest derivatives during development.

This abnormal tissue is neural in origin, as demonstrated by 
expression of neurofilament (Figure 4H). Furthermore, it appears 
to be contiguous with the developing dorsal root ganglia, whose 
overgrowth is a particular pathological finding in Nf1–/– embryos. 
Interestingly, it did not stain for the glial marker S-100 (Figure 4I),  
which is usually positive in neurofibromas, but often negative 
in cells isolated from MPNSTs (39, 40). Hence, the tissue over-
growth seen in this model of Nf1 deficiency and GAP rescue had a 
phenotype that was at least in some respects similar to the malig-
nant tumors found in NF1.

While it remains possible that failure to rescue this neural 
crest aspect of Nf1 deficiency was due to insufficient GAP activ-
ity resulting from HA-GRD expression, this is unlikely. First, 
our examinations have shown that HA-GRD was expressed in 
developing neural crest–derived tissues, such as the dorsal root 
ganglia (Figure 4, J–L). We also found expression of HA-GRD 
via RT-PCR of tissue isolated from microscopic slides of Nf1–/–,  
HA-GRDk/+, CMV-cre+ newborns (data not shown). In addition, 
overall levels of active Ras were returned to normal (Figure 2B). 
Finally, we examined E12.5 Nf1–/– embryos with 2 copies of the 
HA-GRD knock-in allele activated by CMV-cre (Nf1–/–, HA-GRDk/k,  
CMV-cre+), comparing them with wild-type littermates and Nf1–/–  
embryos with a single copy of HA-GRD activated by CMV-cre  

As expected, we did not identify 
any Nf1–/– pups at birth, nor did we 
identify any Nf1–/– pups that carried 
the  CMV-cre  transgene  alone  or  1 
copy of the silent HA-GRDk/+ allele 
in the absence of cre (Table 1). How-
ever, out of 208 newborn pups exam-
ined,  we  identified  5  Nf1–/–  pups 
that were CMV-cre+ and HA-GRDk/+  
(Table 1). Thus, ubiquitous expres-
sion of HA-GRD is able to at least 
partially rescue mid-gestation lethal-
ity of Nf1–/– embryos.

Rescued  Nf1–/–  pups,  however, 
were  not  normal  and  succumbed 
in the perinatal period. Analysis of 
E12.5  embryos  demonstrated  nor-
malization of cardiac development 
with HA-GRD expression in Nf1–/–

(Nf1–/–, HA-GRDk/+, CMV-cre+; Figure 4, M–O). There was enlarge-
ment of the neural crest–derived sympathetic ganglia in both 
Nf1–/– embryos, with no difference in the degree of overgrowth in 
the presence of 1 or 2 copies of HA-GRD knock-in.

Our previous studies have described the importance of neu-
rofibromin modulation of Ras signaling during the formation 
of cardiac valves in early and mid-gestation (34, 37). Epithelial-
mesenchymal transformation during endocardial cushion forma-
tion is abnormal in Nf1–/– embryos in a fashion that can be mim-
icked by Ras activation and blocked by dominant-negative Ras (41). 
Endothelial-specific inactivation of Nf1 recapitulates the embry-
onic cardiac defects seen in Nf1–/– embryos (38). The endocardial 
overgrowth seen in Nf1-deficient embryos resembles that seen in 
mouse models of several related disease syndromes, such as Noon-
an syndrome (42), Costello syndrome (43), and cardio-facial-cuta-
neous syndrome (CFC) (44). The cardiac defects of all of these dis-
orders involve derivatives of the endocardial cushions, such as the 
outflow tract valves. NF1, Noonan syndrome, CFC, and Costello  
syndrome have diverse sets of abnormalities, but share a marked 
incidence of valvar pulmonic stenosis in humans.

The former 2 disorders also share some interesting aspects in 
their clinical presentation. First, there is a clearly recognized condi-
tion with an apparent overlap of NF1 and Noonan syndrome, the 
neurofibromatosis–Noonan syndrome (45). This disease is char-

acterized as neurofibromatosis combined with clinical features of 
Noonan syndrome such as short stature, midface hypoplasia, and 
webbed neck. Some cases of this syndrome have been noted to be 
due to unique mutations in the GRD of NF1 (46). Second, NF1 
and Noonan syndrome also share a propensity for juvenile myelo-
monocytic leukemia (JMML), and we have suggested that the car-
diovascular and hematologic abnormalities in these syndromes 
may represent a defect of the hemangioblast, a common precursor 
of blood and endothelium (47).

The  role  of  Ras  activation  in  the  process  of  epithelial  to 
mesenchymal transformation, and in particular the development 
of the endocardial cushions has been recently demonstrated in 
both animal models (41) and humans. For example, Costello 
syndrome has been found to be the result of activation of H-Ras 
(43). In addition, some cases of CFC and Noonan syndrome have 
activating mutations in K-Ras (44, 48). Further, some models of 
NF1 pathogenesis suggest activation of K-Ras (49). Taken togeth-
er, these data suggest that abnormal Ras activation may account 
for cardiovascular and blood disorders in these related human 
syndromes. Hence, we sought to determine whether HA-GRD 
expression in endothelial cells rescues cardiovascular develop-
ment in Nf1-deficient mice.

Using Tie2-cre (50) to drive HA-GRD expression, we collected 
late-gestation embryos several stages past expected lethality

were also identified.

from cardiovascular failure in Nf1–/–. We found 2 embryos at 
late stages after crossing Nf1+/–, HA-GRDk/+ with Nf1+/–, Tie2-cre+, 
in which endothelial expression of HA-GRD was able to rescue 
the loss of Nf1 (Table 2). Analysis of the late-gestation embryos 
showed normal cardiac anatomy, indistinguishable from wild-
type littermates (Figure 5, A and B). However, as in the HA-GRD 
rescued newborns, there was a marked enlargement of neural 
crest–derived tissues, such as dorsal root ganglia, compared with 
wild type (Figure 5, C and D). Hence, endothelial expression of 
HA-GRD partially rescued mid-gestation cardiovascular lethal-
ity, but failed to rescue the neonatal lethality associated with 
overgrowth of neural crest–derived structures.

Mice lacking Nf1 in the endothelial compartment have the 
same sorts of developmental cardiovascular abnormalities seen 
in the complete Nf1-null embryo (38). However, in rare instanc-
es, these mice survive through embryonic development, only to 
later develop myeloproliferative disease similar to the juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukemia seen in NF1 (47). Pathologically, they 
develop an enlarged spleen with loss of normal tissue architec-
ture due to abnormal overgrowth of granulocytic precursors. 
In littermates expressing HA-GRD, we found that they had less 
splenic enlargement, and partial rescue of splenic architecture, 
with return of germinal centers and loss of fibrosis (Figure 5, 
E–J). These data provide additional evidence for the importance 
of the Ras-GAP activity of neurofibromin in endothelial and 
hematopoietic precursors.

Discussion
Our data suggest that the GAP activity of neurofibromin is suffi-
cient for embryonic endothelial function, a result consistent with 
prior reports (41). Restoration of the Ras-GAP activity through 
expression of the human NF1 GRD was able to normalize cardio-
vascular development. We have previously described how loss of 
Nf1 from the endothelial compartment can recapitulate the car-
diovascular defects of the complete null genotype (38). The present 
work demonstrates that the mechanism for this abnormal cardio-
vascular development stems from hyperactivation of Ras in those 

tissues. Furthermore, our work also suggests that mTOR may be 
an important downstream mediator of this effect, although the 
detailed analysis of this potential downstream effector pathway 
requires clarification (36, 37).

However, not all of the pathologies associated with loss of Nf1 
could be attributed solely to dysregulation of Ras and down-
stream targets. We found that the neural crest pathologies in 
Nf1–/– embryos and mice with ubiquitous expression of HA-GRD  
and reconstitution of NF1 Ras-GAP activity were identical to 
those in tissue-specific neural crest knockout mice (38). Fur-
ther, restoration of ubiquitous NF1 Ras-GAP activity resulted 
in a neonatal lethal phenotype that was no less severe in terms 
of neural crest overgrowth than that seen in neonates with only 
endothelial reconstitution of Ras-GAP activity or with neural 
crest–specific deletion of Nf1. These results strongly argue that 
a function or functions outside the GAP domain of Nf1 are crit-
ical for proper regulation of neural crest growth and homeo-
stasis. In other words, reconstitution of NF1 Ras-GAP activity 
is not sufficient to rescue the loss of neurofibromin in neural 
crest derivatives. While modulation of Ras activity may con-
tribute to NF1 tumor formation or progression, restoration of 
normal Ras activity does not appear to be sufficient to restore 
normal behavior in this tissue. This finding has important 
implications for NF1-related cancer therapy, as current trials 
have targeted activated Ras for the prevention and treatment 
of NF1-related malignancies (26). It should be noted that the 
experimental approach we have chosen has several limitations, 
and that a negative result (lack of rescue) is inherently difficult 
to interpret. Subcellular localization, posttranslational process-
ing, and tissue-specific expression levels of the isolated GRD 
may be different from the full-length protein. While we have 
attempted to control for as many of these variables as possible, 
conclusive demonstration of critical non-GRD functions of 
neurofibromin awaits the identification and characterization 
of these domains. However, our results should encourage this 
further investigation.

Malignant pathologies in NF1 exist in many tissues; however, 
some of the most prominent clinical symptoms are seen in neural 
crest–derived tissues, such as neurofibromas and MPNSTs (8). Our 
findings suggest that therapeutic modalities aimed solely at resto-
ration of normal Ras activity or its downstream effectors may not 
be sufficient in the clinical treatment of these pathologies associ-
ated with NF1. Further understanding of the biological functions 
of neurofibromin in mammalian development will be needed to 
develop better treatments for NF1.

Methods
Mouse breeding and genotyping. Rosa–HA-GRD mice were generated fol-
lowing a protocol similar to that described previously (31). Mice were 
bred on a mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Sv background. Genotyping of Nf1, 
Nf1flox, and Tie2-cre mice was performed as previously described (34, 38, 
50, 51). Genotyping of HA-GRDk/+ mice was slightly modified from that 
for Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor (32). The primers used were as follows: R26F2, 5′-
AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3′; R1295, 5′-GCGAAGAGTTTGTCCT-
CAACC-3′; and R3307, 5′-ACGGGGAGAAATGGATATGAA-3′. Primers 
for CMV-cre (33) were as follows: forward, 5′-ATTCTCCCACCGTCAG-
TACG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGTTTTCTGAGCATACCTGGA-3′. All protocols 
conformed to the guidelines established by the Association for the Assess-
ment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and were approved by 
the University of Pennsylvania Animal Care and Use Committees.

Figure 5
Tie2-cre–mediated expression of HA-GRD rescues cardiac development and hematologic abnormalities. (A and B) Cardiac rescue with 
endothelial expression of HA-GRD. Representative low-power photomicrographs (magnification, ×4) of E17.5 wild-type (A) and Nf1–/–, HA-GRDk/+,  
Tie2-cre+ (B) littermates. There was normal cardiac anatomy, and the inflow valves (arrows) were comparable. However, there was marked 
enlargement of the dorsal root ganglia (arrowheads) in B compared with wild type. Higher-power images (magnification, ×10) of the dorsal root 
ganglia for wild-type (C) and Nf1–/–, HA-GRDk/+, Tie2-cre+ (D) littermates. (E–J) HA-GRD expression rescues hematologic abnormalities of the 
Tie2-cre–mediated loss of Nf1. Gross (E–G) and low-power hematoxylin and eosin photomicrographs (H–J; magnification, ×4) of spleens from 
affected mice and controls. A few Nf1flox/–, Tie2-cre+ mice survived embryonic development, but went on to develop a myeloproliferative disorder 
ultimately resembling juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. This disease was manifest by gross splenic enlargement (F) and loss of normal archi-
tecture (I) compared with Nf1flox/– (E and H). In a Nf1flox/–, HA-GRDk/+, Tie2-cre+ littermate (G and J), in which HA-GRD was expressed under the 
same cre, there was less severe splenic enlargement (G) and a partial rescue of splenic tissue architecture (J).

Histology. Tissue collection, fixation, and staining protocols were as 
previously described (38). Briefly, embryos were collected in ice-cold 
PBS, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, washed in PBS, and 
dehydrated through an ethanol series prior to paraffin embedding. Late-
stage embryos and newborns were decalcified in 0.15 M EDTA, pH 6.6, 
for 48–72 hours prior to dehydration.

Immunohistochemistry protocols were as previously described (38). 
A 2H3-neurofilament monoclonal mouse antibody (Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank) was used at 1:100 concentration, and S-100 
polyclonal rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used at 1:50, with 
secondary detection by HRP activity.

In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (52). Brief-
ly, the 35S-labeled antisense riboprobe to HA-GRD was synthesized with 
T7 RNA polymerase and 35S-UTP. Hybridization was performed at 55°C 
overnight. Slides were dipped in NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak), exposed for 
7 days at 4°C, and developed and fixed in DEKTOL Developer and Fixer 
(Kodak). Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-
Aldrich) and mounted in Canada balsam/methyl salicylate.

Western blots. Tissue lysates were prepared in magnesium lysis buffer (MLB), 
consisting of 2.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630,  
10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml 

leupeptin, and 1 mM sodium orthovanidate. Samples were separated by 
SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Antibodies for eIF4E, 
mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR (serine 2448), phosphorylated mTOR 
(serine 2481), phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK, s6K, phosphorylated s6K, 
s6RP, and phosphorylated s6RP (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 
concentrations as suggested by the manufacturer.

Ras activation assays. Tissue homogenates of cells and embryos were prepared 
in MLB, precleared with glutathione agarose, incubated with raf-1 RBD (Ras 
binding domain) agarose beads (Upstate USA Inc.), and blotted with anti-Ras 
monoclonal antibody (Upstate USA Inc.) following SDS-PAGE and transfer 
to PVDF membranes. These blots of activated Ras (Ras-GTP) were compared 
with blots of the same samples for total Ras prior to raf-1 RBD pulldown to 
quantify Ras activation. Comparison of band intensity was performed with 
NIH ImageJ software version 1.33u (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

Cell  culture  expression.  Cos7  cells  were  transfected  using  Lipofectin 
(Invitrogen)  with  a  cre-dependent  mammalian  expression  plasmid, 
pCCALL2–HA-GRD, based upon the pCCALL2 vector (53). Briefly, the HA-
tagged NF1 GRD used in our knock-in mice was cloned into pCCALL2, allow-
ing for expression following cre-mediated recombination. For expression of 
HA-GRD in cells, they were cotransfected with a mammalian expression vec-
tor for cre recombinase, pTurboCre (GenBank accession no. AF334827).
