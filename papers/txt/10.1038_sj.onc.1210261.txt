The human disease von Recklinghausen’s neuroﬁbroma-
tosis (Nf1) is one of the most common genetic disorders. It
is caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene,
which encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that
negatively regulates p21-RAS signaling. Dermal and
plexiform neuroﬁbromas as well as malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors and other malignant tumors, are
signiﬁcant complications
in Nf1. Neuroﬁbromas are
complex tumors and composed mainly of abnormal local
cells including Schwann cells, endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts
and additionally a large number of inﬁltrating inﬂamma-
tory mast cells. Recent work has indicated a role for
the microenvironment in plexiform neuroﬁbroma genesis.
The emerging evidence points to mast cells as crucial
contributors to neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis. Therefore,
further understanding of
interactions
between Schwann cells and their environment will provide
tools to develop new therapies aimed at delaying or
preventing tumor formation in Nf1 patients.

von Recklinghausen’s Neuroﬁbromatosis Type I

Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (Nf1) was ﬁrst recorded by
Tilesius in 1793 and described in organized detail by the
German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghau-
sen in 1882. Fifty years later, the Viennese ophthalmol-
ogist Lisch described the presence of iris nodules, which
are now an important criterion for the clinical diagnosis
of Nf1 (Riccardi, 1992). It is one of the most common
human genetic diseases. It has a de novo incidence of one

in 3000–4000 individuals and affects male and female
subjects equally in all races (Szudek et al., 2000; Trovo-
Marqui and Tajara, 2006). Although it is inherited as an
autosomal-dominant trait with essentially 100% pene-
trance, spontaneous mutations occur in 50% of cases
(Yohay, 2006). This means the disease will likely remain
in the human population and will have increasing
incidence over time. Nf1 patients have defects in neural
crest-derived tissues,
leading to a wide spectrum of
clinical presentations, including developmental, pigment
and neoplastic aberrations (Cichowski and Jacks, 2001;
Zhu et al., 2001). The cardinal features of Nf1 are cafe´
au lait macules, axillary and groin freckling, combined
with multiple peripheral and central nerve tumors. They
also exhibit a less penetrant variety of additional
pathologies of the skin, nervous system, bones, endo-
crine organs, blood vessels and the eyes (Ward and
Gutmann, 2005) (Table 1).

Biology of Neuroﬁbromin

It encodes a tumor

The NF1 gene is located on human chromosome 17q11.2
and was identiﬁed by positional cloning in 1990 (Ballester
et al., 1990; Xu et al., 1990). It spans over 350 kb of
genomic DNA, and has at least 60 exons (Jentarra et al.,
2006).
suppressor, known as
Neuroﬁbromin (NF1), which is ubiquitously expressed
but most abundant in neurons, Schwann cells, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes and leukocytes (Gutmann et al., 1991;
Daston et al., 1992). Despite its large size, very little is
known about its function. Previous studies have shown a
variety of human mutations associated with Nf1 across
the entire gene (Castle et al., 2003; Jentarra et al., 2006).
The majority of NF1 mutations predict truncations in the
protein, and there is no clear correlation between speciﬁc
mutation and clinical presentations (Castle et al., 2003).
To date, it is known to have two functional domains,
Sec14 and RasGAP (Trovo-Marqui and Tajara, 2006)
(Figure 1). Sec14-interactive domain is located between
amino acids 1545–1816 and is homologous to the yeast
Sec14p, which is known to regulate intracellular proteins
and lipid trafﬁcking in yeast (Mousley et al., 2006).
However, the biological role of Sec14 domain in NF1 is
currently unknown.

Figure 1 Functional domains of NF1. Mouse NF1 is more than
98.5% identical
to its human homologue. Both contain the
p120Ras-GRD, which accelerates the conversion of the active,
GTP-bound Ras into its inactive GDP-bound form.

The RasGAP-related domain (Ras-GRD) in NF1
spans between amino acids 1125–1537 and is corre-
sponding to exons 20–27a (Ballester et al., 1990; Trovo-
Marqui and Tajara, 2006). It accelerates the conversion
of the active, GTP-bound Ras into its inactive GDP-
bound form (Figure 1). Ras is activated at the plasma
membrane upon binding of growth factor receptors to
speciﬁc ligands, triggering the recruitment of a complex
containing the adapter protein growth factor receptor
bound protein 2 (Grb2) and the Ras guanine nucleotide
exchange factor Sos to the site of receptor tyrosine
kinase activation. Here, Ras is catalysed to switch to its
GTP-bound state. This active form of Ras then binds

and activates the kinase Raf and phosphatidylinositol
30-kinase (PI3K), which then sets off a kinase cascade,
culminating the activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK)/mitogen-activated protein kinases ki-
nase and PI3K pathways. Some of these signals are then
transmitted to the nucleus, regulating the expression
of genes controlling cell proliferation, cell death, dif-
ferentiation and migration (Figure 2).
it
is established that constitutively active mutations of
Ras are frequent and associated with multiple human
cancers as a result of permanent stimulation of the
Raf–MAPK and/or PI3K signaling cascades that lead to
uncontrolled cell proliferation and escape of apoptosis
(Weiss et al., 1999).

In fact,

NF1, via its Ras-GRD, exerts a reverse effect on Ras
by increasing the GTP hydrolysis rate. Therefore, its
function as a tumor suppressor is believed to occur by
constraining Ras activity in the normal cell. It is this
biological property of NF1 that is believed to be the
major key to pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying
the clinical presentations of NF1 mutations in both
mice and humans, ranging from learning disability to
malignant tumors (Costa et al., 2002). In fact, beside the
tuberous sclerosis complex, NF1 is the only other
mammalian RasGAP that is known to cause tumor
predisposition disorder in humans.

Li et al. (2005) reported that the learning deﬁcits in
NF1 þ /  mice can be rescued by genetic and pharmaco-
logic manipulations that decrease Ras function. Pre-
vious studies by this group and others have shown that
Ras activity and its downstream effectors are elevated in
the cortex and hippocampus of NF1 þ /  mice, leading to
impairments in long-term potentiation, which is a key
cellular apparatus of learning and memory (Costa et al.,
2002; Li et al., 2005). When NF1 þ /  mice were crossed
with the K-ras þ /  heterozygote to reduce the level of
K-ras expression by half, the NF1 þ / /K-ras þ /  mice
perform as well as the wild-type mice in cognitive
functions. In addition, the learning deﬁcits in the NF1þ / 
mice were also rescued when they were treated with
either farnesyl-transferase inhibitor, which blocks a key
post-translational modiﬁcation essential for Ras func-
tion, or lovastatin, a known Ras isoprenylation inhibitor
(Costa et al., 2002; Li et al., 2005). These results indicate
that increased Ras activity, as a consequence of NF1
mutations,
least partially responsible for the
learning and memory disabilities seen in NF1 mutant
mice and by analogy, suggest a link to the intellectual
deﬁcits described in patients. These learning deﬁcits may
also relate to the ability of NF1 to associate with
microtubules, which are expressed at high level in axonal
and dendritic processes of neurons. Gregory et al. (1993)
and Xu and Gutmann (1997) have shown that the region
of NF1 that is critical for this interaction resides within
the Ras-GRD. Although microtubules may be impor-
tant for neuronal connection and neurite outgrowth, the
exact
function of NF1 relative to microtubules is
currently unknown.

is at

There is increasing evidence indicating that NF1
maybe involved in other cellular functions besides Ras
regulation. Indeed, there exist multiple mutation sites

outside of the NF1 Ras-GRD identiﬁed in Nf1 patients
(Castle et al., 2003; Jentarra et al., 2006). In addition,
Ismat et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing the NF1
GRD only partially rescue the phenotypes seen in NF1 / 
mice, suggesting that other regions of NF1, besides the
Ras-GRD, are also critical for NF1 function. This
group has engineered a mouse line where they inserted
the HA-tagged NF1 GRD (HA-GRD) coding sequence
under ﬂoxed PGK-Neo into the Rosa26 locus. They then
generated compound mice that have CMV-Cre; HA-
GRD; NF1 / , in which they showed that Ras activity in
these mice has returned to wild-type level by the
expression of the HA-GRD. Although NF1 /  mice
are lethal at E13.5 because of cardiac defect, the CMV-
Cre; HA-GRD; NF1 /  mice survive to birth with
normal cardiac anatomy. However, these mice succumb
to death at perinatal period because of overgrowth of
neural crest-derived tissues (Ismat et al., 2006). These
ﬁndings could be interpreted to indicate that not all of
the phenotypes seen in NF1 mutations are solely
secondary to Ras dysregulation. However, the precise
regulation of NF1 activity is not mimicked in the knock-
in mice and, therefore, a ras dysregulation could persist
in these mice.

In another instance, studies in Drosophila, where a
highly conserved homologue of NF1 is present, have
implicated the involvement of NF1 in the cAMP
pathway. Guo et al. (1997) observed that Drosophila
NF1 is crucial for G protein-mediated activation of
adenylyl cyclase, a key enzyme in the cAMP signaling
pathway. In addition, The et al. (1997) showed that
Drosophila homozygous for null mutation of NF1 have
apparently normal Ras1-mediated signaling. However,
these ﬂies have reduced body size. This phenotype was
rescued by increasing the expression of activated protein
kinase A (PKA), an intermediate signaling molecule
between cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and
BRAF-MAPK pathway. Subsequently, Tong et al.

(2002) and Dasgupta et al. (2003) have reported that
NF1 inactivation in mouse primary neuronal or astro-
cyte culture, respectively, results in decreased level of
cAMP production in response to the neuropeptide
pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide. There-
fore, in addition to the Ras pathway, NF1 may also
function upstream of PKA to modulate cell prolife-
ration via the cAMP pathway. However, whether
the PKA-pathway modulation is a ras-dependent or
-independent event has not been fully resolved. Another
remaining caveat is that the biological consequences
of this interaction between NF1 and adenylyl cyclase
may not conserved across species from ﬂy to mouse
to human.

NF1 and tumorigenesis

NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is inherited as an
autosomal-dominant trait, suggesting a possible gene
dosage effect. In fact, haploinsufﬁciency is apparently
enough to bring about many of the clinical manifes-
tations seen in Nf1 patients. However, consistent with
the Knudson ‘two-hit’ model of tumorigenesis, loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) is responsible for the formation of
neuroﬁbromas (Cichowski et al., 1999). On the other
hand, the development of malignant cancers in Nf1
individuals requires further acquisition of additional
genetic aberrations, whether it is inactivation of PTEN,
TP53, CDKN2A or ampliﬁcation of platelet-derived
growth factor receptor or epidermal growth factor
receptor (Zhu and Parada, 2002; Castle et al., 2003;
Levy et al., 2004). Reminiscent with the malignancies
seen in Nf1 patients, compound heterozygous mice for
both NF1 and p53 develop malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors with full penetrance (Cichowski et al.,
1999; Vogel et al., 1999). In addition, as Nf1 has a
spectrum of speciﬁc tumors, modifying genes and

epigenetic phenomena have been shown to play a role in
modulating Nf1-associated tumor susceptibility (Easton
et al., 1993; Reilly et al., 2004).

Neuroﬁbromas and malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors
Neuroﬁbromas are the most common tumor in Nf1 and
classiﬁed into three subtypes. Dermal and subcutaneous
forms appear at puberty and increase in number with
age and during pregnancy. They occur as a result of
proliferation of all supporting elements of the nerve
ﬁbers, including Schwann cells, perineurial cells, ﬁbro-
blasts, blood vessels, as well as inﬁltration of mast cells.
Plexiform neuroﬁbromas occur in about 30% of Nf1
individuals and are virtually pathognomonic of
the
disease. They are congenital and progressively enlarge
throughout life. Although dermal neuroﬁbromas are
most frequently benign, patients with plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas have a 10% lifetime risk of developing malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which can
metastases widely and are often signaling a fatal outcome
(Lakkis and Tennekoon, 2000; Ferner, 2006). In addition,
owing to their unusual capacity for growth, plexiform
neuroﬁbromas can be life threatening by their physical
impairment of organ or neural function.

Research over the past decade using mouse models
has greatly enhanced our knowledge of neuroﬁbroma
development and malignant progression in Nf1. Mice
homozygous for NF1 mutation are embryonic lethal at
E13.5 secondary to defective heart and malformation of
the major cardiac outﬂow tracts. They also exhibit
hyperplasia of neural crest-derived sympathetic ganglia
(Brannan et al., 1994; Jacks et al., 1994). To the
contrary, heterozygous NF1 mutant mice are viable
and only have increased incidence of pheochromocyto-
mas and myeloid leukemias beyond 10- to 12-month old
(Parada, 2000). Puzzlingly, in contrast to the human

condition, NF1 þ /  mice do not develop neuroﬁbromas
(Brannan et al., 1994; Jacks et al., 1994) (Figure 3). One
possible explanation for this observation is that LOH
necessary for neuroﬁbroma development is impaired in
mice. Perhaps, given the short time of gestation and
lifespan and a smaller neural crest compartment
compared with human, the NF1 þ /  mice do not have
the necessary window of opportunity to undergo
effective LOH in target cells to initiate neuroﬁbroma
formation. Cichowski et al. (1999) addressed this issue
elegantly when they created chimeric mice by injecting
LacZ-positive NF1 /  ES cells into wild-type C57BL/6
blastocysts. These mice developed microscopic neuroﬁ-
bromas derived from the injected ES cells, demonstrat-
ing the requirement of NF1 homozygosity for tumor
formation. However, the degree of chimerism in these
mice occurs
controlled
genetically. As a result, it is difﬁcult to establish the
target cell or whether other cell types contribute to the
tumorigenesis.

randomly and cannot be

To circumvent this problem and to develop a more
precise mouse model for evaluating the evolution of
Nf1-associated tumors, Cre/loxP technology that allows
tissue-speciﬁc ablation of NF1 function has been
adopted. Schwann cell-speciﬁc NF1-deﬁcient mice were
derived by crossing NF1ﬂox/ﬂox mice with the Krox20-cre
transgenic mice, an embryonic Schwann cell-speciﬁc
promoter (Zhu et al., 2002). Mice with a conditional
knockout (KO) of NF1 only in embryonic Schwann
cells, but wild-type in all other cell lineages (NF1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Krox20-Cre), exhibit microscopic hyperplasia in sensory
ganglia but do not develop neuroﬁbromas. However,
when mice homozygous for NF1 mutation (NF1 / ) in
Schwann cells but heterozygous for NF1 (NF1 þ / ) in all
other somatic cells (NF1ﬂox/ ; Krox20-Cre) were gene-
rated, these mice developed multiple classic plexiform
neuroﬁbromas with a massive degranulating mast cell
inﬁltration, modeling human neuroﬁbroma (Zhu et al.,

Figure 3 Schwann cell origin and the role of tumor microenvironment in neuroﬁbroma formation. Both nullizygosity at NF1 locus in
Schwann cells and haploinsufﬁciency of NF1 in the somatic tissue are required for neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis. In addition, the NF1-
heterozygous mast cells inﬁltration into nerve tissues precedes development of NF1ﬂox/ ;Krox20-Cre plexiform neuroﬁbromas, implying
a unique afﬁnity between NF1 /  Schwann cells and NF1 þ /  mast cells and a causal role for mast cells in tumor initiation.

2002) (Figure 3). These genetic studies implied the
Schwann cell origin for neuroﬁbroma. Nevertheless, in
addition to nullizygosity at NF1 locus in Schwann cells,
haploinsufﬁciency of NF1 in the tumor microenviron-
ment is also required for the tumorigenesis.

The p53 and NF1 genes are linked on chromosome 17
in human and on chromosome 11 in mouse. To model
malignant progression in human neuroﬁbromatosis, two
groups have generated mice that are compound hetero-
zygous for both p53 and NF1 in cis conﬁguration. These
mice develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
(MPNST) with full penetrant, recapitulated malignan-
cies seen in Nf1 patients. DNA analysis of tumors
reveals loss of both wild-type alleles, indicating that the
loss of both genes orchestrate to cause MPNST
development (Cichowski et al., 1999; Vogel et al., 1999).

to the retina. However,

Optic pathway gliomas
The second most common tumor in Nf1 is optic
pathway gliomas, originally reportes in about 15% of
Nf1 individuals although current imaging technology
suggests that the incidence of non-pathologic tumors is
considerably higher. These are low-grade but potentially
debilitating pilocytic astrocytomas as they often arise
along the optic nerves and chiasm (Arun and Gutmann,
2004). To elucidate the role of NF1 in astrocytoma
tumorigensis, mice lacking NF1 in astrocytes and neural
precursors have been generated using two different
hGFAP-Cre transgenic lines (Bajenaru et al., 2002,
2003; Zhu et al., 2005). Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) is a marker for astrocyte and neural stem/
progenitor cells. The hGFAP-Cre transgene drives Cre
in both astrocytes and glial precursors and neurons
adjacent
the hGFAP*-Cre
transgene only drives Cre in astrocytes, not in glial
precursor and neuron in the retina. Intercrossing the
hGFAP-Cre transgene into NF1ﬂox/ﬂox or NF1ﬂox/  back-
grounds gives phenotypically identical offspring, termed
NF1hGFAP KO. The NF1hGFAP KO mice develop neoplasia
at the optic nerves reminiscent of human optic glioma,
especially at areas adjacent to the retina. On the other
hand, the NF1ﬂox/ﬂox; hGFAP*-Cre mutant mice did not
develop glioma (Zhu et al., 2005). These results show
that loss of NF1 in microglias and neurons in the
surrounding adjacent environment may contribute to
optic glioma tumorigenesis. In other studies, Bajenaru
et al.
(2002, 2003) did not observe astrocytoma
formation in the NF1ﬂox/ﬂox; hGFAP*-Cre mice but did
detect optic glioma in the NF1ﬂox/  ; hGFAP*-Cre mice,
further stressing the importance of haploinsufﬁciency of
NF1 in the tumor microenvironment for Nf1-associated
glioma formation.

Other tumors
In addition to MPNST, Nf1 patients are predisposed
to develop other malignancies. They include pheochro-
mocytomas,
juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia,
malignant astrocytoma, rhadomyosarcoma of the geni-
to-urinary tract, duodenal carcinoid, somatostatinoma
and parathyroid adenoma. The fact that not all Nf1

patients succumb to malignancy implies that other
genetic and non-genetic factors greatly inﬂuence Nf1-
associated tumor susceptibility (Castle et al., 2003). As
such, Tyler Jacks and co-workers have shown that mice
mutant for both p53 and NF1 in cis conﬁguration
develop malignant astrocytoma, progression to glio-
blastoma, in C57BL/6J background but not in 129S4/
SvJae background (Reilly et al., 2004), indicating roles
for modifying genes and epigenetic phenomena. In
addition, identical twins that have Neuroﬁbromatosis
type I have been shown to have similar pattern of cafe´ au
lait macules and other cutaneous presentations but differ
greatly on malignant susceptibility (Easton et al., 1993).

Neuroﬁbromas and tumor microenvironment

the NF1 þ /  mice
In the conventional KO model,
(containing NF1 þ /  Schwann cells and NF1 þ /  mast
cell) did not have mast cell inﬁltration into nerves and
did not develop neuroﬁbroma (Parada et al., 2005).
Subsequently, in the tissue-speciﬁc KO model using Cre/
loxP technology, the NF1ﬂox/ﬂox;Krox20-Cre mice (con-
taining NF1 /  Schwann cells and NF1 þ / þ mast cell)
also did not exhibit mast cell inﬁltration into peripheral
nerves and did not develop neuroﬁbromas. On the other
hand, the NF1ﬂox/ ;Krox20-Cre mice (containing NF1 / 
Schwann cells and NF1 þ /  mast cell) have massive mast
cell
inﬁltration and develop plexiform neuroﬁbromas
(Zhu et al., 2002) (Figure 3). This fact indicates the
essential role for the heterozygous environment and
speciﬁcally implicates heterozygote mast cells as critical
accomplices in the development of neuroﬁbroma.

However, exactly how mast cells promote tumor
development remains unknown. In regard to neuroﬁ-
broma tumorigenesis, the interaction between Schwann
cells and their environment could be bi-directional,
where the NF1 /  Schwann cells can alter their micro-
environment to promote neuroﬁbroma formation. In
this regard, we observed that there are massive NF1-
heterozygous mast cells inﬁltration into nerve tissues
long before the NF1ﬂox/ ;Krox20-Cre mice develop frank
plexiform neuroﬁbromas (Zhu et al., 2002).

Through elegant tissue culture studies, Clapp and co-
workers have shown convincing evidence that NF1 þ / 
mast
cells are hyperproliferative and hypermotile
toward stem cell factors (SCF), a natural ligand for
the tyrosine receptor kinase C-kit. In addition, they
demonstrated that the NF1 /  Schwann cells produce
elevated levels of SCF, which can stimulate this mast
cell migration and proliferation (Yang et al., 2003).
Recently, Clapp and co-workers also established that
NF1 þ /  mast cells secreted elevated level of tumor
growth factor
that
stimulate NF1 þ /  ﬁbroblast to proliferate and synthesize
excessive collagen (Yang et al., 2006), a histopathologic
feature of neuroﬁbroma. These results are in striking
alignment with the mouse modeling data. A compelling
scenario is that NF1 /  Schwann cells recruit NF1 þ / 
mast cells via SCF. Once in place, the NF1-heterozygous
mast cells produce mitogens and facilitate a permissive

(TGF)-b, a proﬁbrotic factor

microenvironment for tumor formation. Mast cells are
also known to make vascular endothelial growth factor
and other angiogenic factors leading to neovasculariza-
tion, which could sustain neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis
(Theoharides and Conti, 2004) (Figure 4).

Future therapies for Neuroﬁbromatosis type I

Clinical management for the Nf1 patients requires a
multidisciplinary approach and the use of a multi-
speciality Neuroﬁbromatosis clinic is desirable. However,
current treatment options for Nf1 are primarily limited
to surgery and longitudinal surveillance. The advances
provided by transgenic mouse models as the cloning of
NF1 may afford new opportunity for speciﬁc target
therapies, which are beginning to emerge. Therapeutic
approaches aimed at the reduction of Ras-GTP levels in
affected tissues of the neural crest-derived cells can be
expected to relieve some of the Nf1 symptoms, from
learning disability to tumor susceptibility. In fact, several
from lovastatin for
clinical
Nf1-associated learning disability to Ras
inhibitor
farnesyl-transferase for plexiform neuroﬁbroma (http://
clinicaltrials.gov/). It is reasonable to speculate that
lessons learned from the molecular interactions between
Schwann cells and their microenvironment will provide
us novel approaches to develop new therapies to delay
and to prevent neuroﬁbroma formation in Nf1 patients.

trials are under way,

Conclusions

The clinical presentations of Nf1 in an individual, in
addition to the emotional burden of carrying the disease
and social stigma, have a signiﬁcant impact on the
patient’s quality of life (Page et al., 2006). Although
the mortality is not high in Neuroﬁbromatosis type I,
the morbidity is tremendous. The hope for Nf1 patients,
therefore,
is that new understanding into molecular
pathogenesis will lead to novel treatment. Surprising
advances have been made in the research of neuroﬁ-
bromatosis type I in the past decade. Mouse modeling in
the Nf1 arena may represent a breakthrough in the use
of mouse models of human cancer, not
through
recapitulation of the disease, which has been achieved
for many human cancers, but through the derivation
of important insights into the biology of the disease
that may guide toward novel therapeutic windows. If
expounded upon, this recent knowledge could be used to
develop effective treatment for one of the most common
human genetic diseases in the world today.
