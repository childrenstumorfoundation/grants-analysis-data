We report the characterization of BMS-911543, a potent and
selective small-molecule inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK)
family member, JAK2. Functionally, BMS-911543 displayed
potent anti-proliferative and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in
cell lines dependent upon JAK2 signaling, and had little activity
in cell types dependent upon other pathways, such as JAK1
and JAK3. BMS-911543 also displayed anti-proliferative re-
sponses in colony growth assays using primary progenitor
cells isolated from patients with JAK2V617F-positive myelopro-
liferative neoplasms (MPNs). Similar to these in vitro observa-
tions, BMS-911543 was also highly active in in vivo models of
JAK2 signaling, with sustained pathway suppression being
observed after a single oral dose. At low dose levels active in
JAK2-dependent PD models, no effects were observed in an in
vivo model of immunosuppression monitoring antigen-induced
IgG and IgM production. Expression proﬁling of JAK2V617F-
expressing cells treated with diverse JAK2 inhibitors revealed a
shared set of transcriptional changes underlying pharmacolo-
gical effects of JAK2 inhibition,
including many STAT1-
regulated genes and STAT1 itself. Collectively, our results
highlight BMS-911543 as a functionally selective JAK2 inhibitor
and support the therapeutic rationale for its further character-
ization in patients with MPN or in other disorders characterized
by constitutively active JAK2 signaling.

Introduction

JAK2,

JAK1,

The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of non-receptor tyrosine
JAK3 and TYK2.1 JAKs
kinases comprised of
integrate cytokine signal transduction cascades in a variety of
diverse cell types through the phosphorylation and subsequent
activation of the family of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) proteins that
in turn regulate a gene
expression program underlying survival, proliferation and
differentiation.2,3 Human genetic disorders or mouse knockout
studies have collectively implicated essential roles of JAK-STAT
signaling in various aspects of hematopoiesis. The importance of
these family members in immune cell function is highlighted by
observations that genetic inactivation of human JAK3 or its
cognate cytokine receptor, gc, results in a severe combined
immunodeﬁciency.4,5 Similarly, JAK1 deﬁciency is associated

through defects in
with decreased lymphocyte development
type I (IFN-a) and type II (IL-2) cytokine signaling, whereas
human TYK2 deﬁciency is associated with impaired anti-
microbial and allergic responses indicating important roles of
these family members in the regulation of key aspects of
immune cell development and maintenance.6,7 In contrast,
JAK2 has been implicated in erythropoiesis through its associa-
tion with the selective association with the single chain cytokine
receptor, erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R).8

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal malignan-
cies characterized by the uncontrolled expansion of multipotent
hematopoeitc progenitor cells.9 The most common BCR–ABL-
negative MPNs are polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombo-
cytosis (ET) and primary myeloﬁbrosis. Each MPN is associated
with clinically distinct
features with PV, ET and primary
myeloﬁbrosis being associated with increased erythrocytes,
platelets or bone marrow ﬁbrosis, respectively, and all MPNs
are associated with progression to acute myeloid leukemia.10,11
Several laboratories identiﬁed JAK2V617F-activating mutations at
high prevalence in MPNs with frequencies of mutation
estimated at B90% in PV and B50% in primary myeloﬁbrosis
and ET.12–14 In JAK2V617F-negative MPN, mutually exclusive
activating mutations in the JAK2 at exon 12 have also been
observed.15,16 Lastly, in B5–10% of JAK2V617F-negative ET and
primary myeloﬁbrosis, mutations that
in the ligand-
independent activation of
the thrombopoietin receptor have
been identiﬁed which produce constitutive downstream activa-
tion of JAK2-STAT signaling.17,18 Transgenic expression of these
mutations into hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice is able to
reconstitute many of the features of human MPN including
increased red cell mass, splenomegaly and bone marrow
ﬁbrosis.19,20 Collectively, these ﬁndings underscore the critical
role of aberrant JAK2 signaling in MPNs and highlight JAK2 as
an attractive molecular target for the therapeutic intervention
in MPN and other malignancies associated with aberrant
JAK2-STAT signaling.

Because of

these features,

small-molecule JAK
inhibitors are being optimized pre-clinically or are being tested
in clinical development for patients afﬂicted with MPN.21 The
compounds in development inhibit JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity
by competing for ATP binding and have varying degrees of cross
inhibitory activity to other JAK family members, such as JAK1
in the kinome.22
and JAK3, as well as other kinases
A consequence of non-selectivity to JAK1 or JAK3 is thought
to be a potential for immunosuppression given the role of these
kinases in immune cell function23 and as such, compounds with
such activities may be associated with additional dose-limiting
toxicities compared with other JAK2-selective inhibitors. Here,
we report the characterization of BMS-911543, a reversible

pyrrolopyridine ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK2. The results
of our characterization highlight the high degree of functional
selectivity of this small-molecule inhibitor toward JAK2 in a
variety of pre-clinical models and support the ongoing clinical
testing of BMS-91153 in MPN patients.

Materials and methods

Reagents
The chemical characterization of BMS-911543 (N,N-dicyclopropyl-
4-((1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)-6-ethyl-1-methyl-1,6-dihy-
droimidazo[4,5-d]pyrrolo[2,3b]pyridine-7-carboxamide) will be
described elsewhere (AP and MVL, unpublished data). BMS-
911543 was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide as a 10 mM stock
solution or in 20% citrate/80% PEG400 vehicle for in vitro or in
vivo experiments, respectively. Recombinant enzymes were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) or produced as
described previously.24 Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) used
for immunization was purchased from Pierce (Rockford,
IL,
USA). SET2 cells were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig,
Germany).

Biochemical kinase assays
The inhibitory activity of BMS-911543 in biochemical kinase
assays using recombinant enzymes was performed as described
previously.24 Brieﬂy,
incubation mixtures included: 1.1 nM
JAK2, 1.5 mM peptide substrate (5-FAM-KKKKEEIYFFFG-OH for
JAK2) and 30 mM ATP. The reaction mixture was analyzed on a
Caliper LabChip 3000 (Caliper LifeSciences, Hopinkton, MA,
USA) by electrophoretic separation of the ﬂuorescent substrate
and phosphorylated product after 180 min. The inhibitory
activity of BMS-911543 against multiple other recombinant
enzymes was evaluated using similar methodology in kinase
assays or for interaction with over 450 kinases at 1 mM in
collaboration with Ambit Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA)
using competition-binding assays, as described previously.25 For
enzyme kinetics, BMS-911543 was tested from 42 pM to 8.33 mM
against JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3. All kinase reactions were carried
out at room temperature with g-[33P]-labeled ATP at 3.75–
100 mM for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 1%
phosphoric acid. Phosphorylated peptide was captured on 96-
well phosphocellulose ﬁlter plates using a vacuum manifold and
quantiﬁed using scintillation counting. ki was determined from
global ﬁts using a competitive inhibition model for JAK1 and
JAK3: v¼ (Vmax [S])/(km ((1þ [I]/ki)n)þ [S]), and a mixed-
for JAK2: v¼ Vmax [S]/(km (1þ ([I]/
type inhibition model
ki)n)þ [S] (1þ ([I]/ki

0)n)).

Anti-proliferative and apoptosis assays
The anti-proliferative effects of BMS-911543 on tumor cell lines
were monitored by [3H] thymidine incorporation. Cells were
incubated with stepwise dilutions of compound for 72 h in RPMI
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. On day 4,
0.022 mCi/ml of [3H] thymidine was added to each well and
allowed to incubate for 3–4 h. Cells were harvested onto ﬁlter
plates, washed and processed for incorporated radioactivity on a
scintillation counter.
In certain instances, Ba/F3-engineered
cells were propagated in the presence of recombinant human
erythropoietin (EPO, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or
recombinant mouse IL-3 (Invitrogen). SET2 or Ba/F3 cell lines
were treated with BMS-911543 as indicated in the results
section and processed for
the induction of apoptosis via

Human whole-blood assays and MPN-patient colony
growth assays
JAK family functional selectivity was monitored in human whole
blood ex vivo using FACS and cytokine stimulation. Brieﬂy,
blood from healthy volunteers was drawn and added to the
96-well plate containing varying concentrations of compound in
dose–response format and incubated with a ﬁxed concentration
of cytokine for 1 h. Removal of red blood cells by lysis and
ﬁxation of the remaining cells was achieved by incubation at
37 1C for 15 min (Fix and Lyse, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). Surface antibodies were then incubated with the cells
prior to permeabilzation and phospho-STAT antibodies addi-
tion. Cytokine-stimulated JAK2 activity was monitored in human
platelets selected with CD61 ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-con-
jugated antibody (BD Biosciences), with thrombopoietin (TPO)
stimulation (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and pSTAT5
detection (pY695 Alexa647 conjugated, BD Biosciences).
Samples were analyzed on a FACS Canto II using DIVA 6.1.1
software (BD Biosciences). Assays for JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2
functional selectivity responses were monitored in a similar
format using CD3-selected lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2, IL-
4, IL-15 and IFN-a (Peprotech). Inhibitory concentration (IC50)
determinations were calculated based on 50% inhibition on the
fold-induction between cytokine and unstimulated treatments.
The protocol for examining the effects of JAK2 inhibitors on
MPN-patient colony growth has been reported previously.26

cells were plated in methylcellulose-based, semisolid media
(MethoCult, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada)
supplemented with cytokines. Colony growth was measured
over the course of 2 weeks and was scored according to
standard morphological criteria.

Western blot analysis
Evaluation of BMS-911543 effects on Ba/F3 or SET2 cell lines or
tumor xenograft lysates was performed by western blotting. For
cell lines, roughly 500 000 cells per ml of media were incubated
with compound in dose–response format for 2 h, and subse-
quently processed for western blotting for p-STAT5 (tyrosine
694, BD Biosciences, 1:400 dilution),
total STAT5 protein
antibodies (BD Biosciences, 1:400 dilution), p-STAT3 (tyrosine
705, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA, 1:500 dilution), STAT3
(Cell Signaling, 1:500 dilution),
ID1 (R&D Systems, 1:1000
dilution), PIM1 (Cell Signaling, 1:500 dilution), pSTAT1
(tyrosine 701, Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution) or STAT1
(AbCam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:500 dilution) at 1:400
dilution. SET2 cells were also treated for 24 h with BMS-
911543 for the analysis of STAT1 levels. Protein extracts from
snap-frozen SET2 tumors were prepared and similarly processed
for pSTAT5/STAT5, as described for the cell line analysis.

Gene-expression proﬁling
Following a 4-h treatment of SET2 cells with JAK2 inhibitors,
mRNA was processed for the Affymetrix HT-HG-U133A array
and the results were analyzed by the SDRS algorithm as
described.27 See Supplementary Information for additional
details.

AV Purandare et al

In Vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) assays
BMS-911543 dosing solutions were administered to BALB/c mice
by oral gavage at the indicated dose levels. After BMS-911543
administration, triplicate animals per time point were euthanized
and blood was harvested via cardiac puncture for preparation of
pharmacokinetic (PK) or PD analyses. Platelets were stimulated
ex vivo with murine TPO (mTPO, Peprotech) and stained for
CD61 (anti-CD61 FITC, eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA).
Samples were then processed for p-STAT5 levels, as described
above, using anti-pY695 Alexa647-conjugated STAT5 antibody.
SET2 cells were inoculated into female athymic mice and
propagated as subcutaneous xenografts. Animals with tumors
reaching B500 mm3 were administered BMS-911543 or vehicle
as described above for the indicated times. Tumors were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for p-STAT5 for western
blot analysis as described above.

Analysis of antigen-induced antibody generation in vivo
Female BALB/c mice (6–8 week-old) were immunized intraper-
itoneally with 250 mg KLH (Pierce)
in phosphate-buffered
solution on day 0. Mice in appropriate groups were dosed as
indicated with BMS-911543. Blood was collected on day 7 and
day 14 post immunization. Serum was separated and analyzed
for anti-KLH IgM titers (day 7) and anti-KLH IgG titers (day 14)
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Captured anti-KLH
antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated antibody speciﬁc for mouse IgM or
IgG (Southern
Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA) and the
TMB peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard and Perry Labora-
tories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Optical densities of developed
plates were quantiﬁed in a SpectraMax Plus ELISA plate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Serum from vehicle-
treated BALB/c mice collected on day 7 (IgM) or on day 14 (IgG)
after immunization with KLH was pooled and used as a standard
comparator in each respective assay.

In Vitro characterization of BMS-911543
BMS-911543 is a pyrrolopyridine small-molecule inhibitor that was
initially characterized using an in vitro assay with human
recombinant
JAK enzyme. BMS-911543 displayed an IC50 of
1.1 nM against JAK2 and was approximately 350-, 75- and 65-fold
selective to JAK1,
respectively (Figure 1).
Comparison of dissociation constants of BMS-911543 for JAK1,
JAK2 and JAK3 extended these ﬁndings and displayed a broader
selectivity for JAK2 with Ki values of 1114, 0.48 and 357 nM,
respectively. BMS-911543 maintained selectivity outside of the JAK
family in an additional 26 biochemical kinase assays and against
over 450 other kinases using ATP competitive binding assays (see
Supplementary Figure 1). Outside the JAK family,
the highest
inhibitory activity was observed for the Src family member, Lyn
(IC50¼ 300 nM),
kinase
(IC50¼ 450 nM), which were both signiﬁcantly less sensitive than
JAK2 (4250-fold). All other kinases examined displayed even less
inhibition (500 to 41000-fold less sensitive) to BMS-911543. These
results demonstrate the biochemical selectivity of BMS-911543 for
JAK2 within the JAK family and across the broader kinome.

cells such as SET2 or Ba/F3 engineered to express JAK2V617F,
BMS-911543 treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent anti-
proliferative effect with IC50 values of 60 and 70 nM, respec-
tively (Figure 2a). Ba/F3 cells expressing a mutated TPO receptor
(MPLW515L) that constitutively activates JAK2 signal transduction
also displayed an anti-proliferative effect to BMS-911543 but a
decreased level (IC50¼ 260 nM) as compared with JAK2V617F-
expressing cells. The anti-proliferative response of BMS-911543

induction of apoptosis
comparison of cytokine-stimulated JAK2WT cells to constitu-
tively activated JAK2V617F cells revealed an increased sensitivity
for anti-proliferative and pSTAT5 responses for the ligand-
independent pathway (Figures 2a and c). In contrast to these
JAK2-dependent cells, cell lines reliant on other JAK family
members, including CTLL2 and parental Ba/F cells, stimulated
with IL-3 did not show a signiﬁcant anti-proliferative response to
BMS-911543. JAK2-STAT5 signaling has been reported to be
constitutively activated in a subset of B-cell lymphomas through
the genetic inactivation of
the negative pathway regulator
SOCS1.28 In contrast to what was observed for JAK2V617F- or
MPLW515L-expressing cell lines, BMS-911543 treatment did not
result in a signiﬁcant anti-proliferative effect in several B-cell
lymphoma lines, including KARPAS1106, L1236 or HDLM-2.
Lack of anti-proliferative responses were also observed in
several solid tumor cell
lines of distinct histopathologies
(A549, MDA-MB-231, MiaPaCa-2) consistent with these cells
dependence upon pathways other than JAK2.

To explore the functional selectivity of BMS-911543 further,
we monitored the effects of BMS-911543 on speciﬁc cytokine-
stimulated pSTATs in a human whole-blood ex vivo assay. For
JAK2 selective responses, we monitored TPO-stimulated
pSTAT5 in human platelets which showed a robust induction
of the pathway that was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
by BMS-911543, an observation consistent with this type I
cytokine receptor being more reliant on JAK2 for its signal
transduction (Figure 2b). We also examined the effects of BMS-
911543 on cytokine receptors and cell types that are more
dependent upon JAK1 and JAK3, such as IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15,

CD61-gated platelets or CD3-gated lymphocytes is shown in the upper panel. Red traces and blue traces indicate the absence and presence of

apoptosis was expressed as the level of annexin V staining observed versus dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) control under the same treatment
conditions. All values are representative of at least two independent experiments.

and found that the inhibitor did not show as signiﬁcant effects
compared with TPO. In contrast, a pyrrolopyrimidine pan-JAK
inhibitor (see Supplementary Table 1) displayed potent re-
sponses across all cytokine end points with more pronounced
effects observed for JAK1 and JAK3 end points than for JAK2
(data not shown). Consistent with the biochemical selectively of
BMS-911543, these cellular responses collectively demonstrate
the functional selectivity of the inhibitor for JAK2.

BMS-911543 suppresses the growth of MPN patient-
derived cells
To further evaluate the sensitivity of BMS-911543 in a JAK2-
mediated disease context, we performed colony growth assays
in cytokine-supported media using primary hematopoetic
progenitor cells isolated from MPN patients. The assay was ﬁrst
performed using CD34
progenitors isolated from normal
healthy volunteers in the presence of varying concentrations of
BMS-911543 to determine the effects on cytokine-stimulated
JAK2WT function. BMS-911543 inhibited EPO-mediated burst
forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony growth with an IC50 of
B1.5 mM (Figure 3a), a response consistent with the TPO-
stimulated human whole-blood assay which monitors wild-type
JAK2 function (see Figure 2). The inhibitor was next evaluated in
the colonogenic growth assays using cells isolated from six
different MPN patients that expressed JAK2V617F, JAK2EXON12 or
MPLW515L mutations. In the presence of EPO, BFU-E IC50s for

BMS-911543 in MPN-patient cells ranged from o0.150 to
B0.9 mM (Figure 3b) indicating an increased sensitivity to JAK2
inhibition compared with normal healthy volunteers.

A hallmark of the JAK2-mutated MPN progenitor cells is their
ability to undergo EPO-independent erythroid colony formation.
To further deﬁne the sensitivity on the afﬂicted progenitor cells,
we compared the effects of BMS-911543 on EPO-dependent
and EPO-independent BFU-E potential
in cells from MPN
patients harboring JAK2V617F mutations.
In the presence of
EPO, BMS-911543 displayed a BFU-E IC50 of B0.3 mM
compared with an IC50 of 0.075 mM in EPO-independent
erythroid colony formation in a representative JAK2V617F-
positive MPN patient sample (Figure 3c). These results establish
proof of concept for BMS-911543 in MPN patient primary cells
ex vivo and demonstrate the differential sensitivity of
the
JAK2V617F pathway compared with the cytokine-stimulated
JAK2WT pathway.

In vivo pSTAT5 inhibition by JAK2 inhibition
To extend the ﬁndings of differential pathway sensitivity to BMS-
911543, we next examined the effects of the compound in vivo.
For the analysis of the JAK2WT response in vivo, we utilized a
PD–PK model where blood was harvested from animals after
compound administration at different
time points and dose
levels. Platelets were then isolated, treated with TPO ex vivo to
induce the pSTAT5, and the effects of BMS-911543 at a single

oral dose of 5, 10 and 30 mg/kg were compared with vehicle-
treated animals. At 30 mg/kg, BMS-911543 fully suppressed
(100% inhibition) pSTAT5 induction at all time points (1–18 h
post dose) demonstrating the durable effects on the pathway
after a single dose (Figure 4a). At the intermediate 10 mg/kg
dose, B75% reduction was observed up to 18 h. The lowest
dose level tested in the study, 5 mg/kg, revealed a roughly 50%
reduction in TPO-stimulated pSTAT5 by B8 h. These dose-
dependent pSTAT5 reductions correlated with the serum
exposures of BMS-911543, with AUC(0 8h) mM h values of
22.9, 41.2 and 109.3 observed, respectively, for 5, 10 and
30 mg/kg dose levels. These results indicate durable and potent
reductions of cytokine-activated JAK2WT-pSTAT5 by BMS-
911543 after a single oral dose.

We next examined the effects of BMS-911543 in vivo on the
JAK2V617F pathway. To this end, we developed SET2 cells to
grow as a subcutaneous xenograft
in athymic mice, and
examined the effects of JAK2 inhibition on the constitutively
pSTAT5 end point. We examined BMS-911543 at a lower dose
range in this model with 1 mg/kg being the lowest dose tested.
At
the highest dose tested, 10 mg/kg, BMS-911543 showed
90–100% inhibition of pSTAT5 up to 7 h post dose. The 5-mg/kg
dose level also showed pronounced activity, with up to 90%
pSTAT5 inhibition observed at 7 h post compound administra-
tion. The 2- and 1-mg/kg dose levels also showed activity, with
the 2-mg/kg dose showing X50% pSTAT5 inhibition, whereas
the 1-mg/kg dose showed an activity of 30–40% inhibition. In

this model, 2 mg/kg of BMS-911543 was deﬁned as the
minimum dose level to achieve 50% inhibition of the pSTAT5
PD end point. Similar levels of activity were also observed for
BMS-911543 on pSTAT5 in Ba/F3EPORV617F tumor-bearing mice
(data not shown). Collectively, these ﬁndings further demon-
strate the potent and durable in vivo activity of BMS-911543 as
the JAK2V617F
well as highlight an increased sensitivity of
pathway in vivo.

Effects of JAK2 inhibition on antigen-induced humoral
immune response in vivo
JAK2 selectivity of small-molecule inhibitors is thought to have
less immunosuppressive potential
than inhibitors containing
other JAK family inhibitor activities, particularly JAK1 and JAK3.
To evaluate this hypothesis functionally, we administered BMS-
911543 in an antigen-induced antibody production model,
which is used to assess an adaptive humoral immune response
(Figure 5). In this model, mice were immunized with KLH, and
serum was isolated and analyzed for anti-KLH IgM titers and
anti-KLH IgG titers in vehicle- or BMS-911543-treated animals.
BMS-911543 had no effect on IgM antibody titers at day 7 at all
doses tested, including the highest dose of 30 mg/kg. Reductions
in IgG levels by BMS-911543 were observed at 10 (B65%
reduction) and 30 mg/kg (B85% reduction). No effects were
observed for 3 mg/kg BMS-911543 on IgG antibody levels after
14 days of compound administration. These ﬁndings indicate a

Identiﬁcation of a JAK2-regulated transcriptional

JAK2 inhibition in SET2 cells leads to an anti-proliferative

the
precise transcriptional program that
is affected by pathway
inhibition has not been fully elucidated. To investigate the
underlying transcriptional changes associated with JAK2
inhibition, we performed gene-expression proﬁling in SET2
cells. For this analysis, we used a full dose range of three
independent JAK2 inhibitors representing distinct chemotypes to
identify a shared response signature as well as rule out
possible off-target activities (Supplementary Table 1). Analysis

interested in STAT1 and STAT1-regulated genes (PIM1 and

BMS-911543 treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in STAT1 levels but
required longer compound
exposure (24 h) compared with reductions in STAT1 transcript
(4 h). PIM1 and ID1 protein levels also were dose dependently
decreased in SET2 cells by BMS-911543 (Figure 6c), but with
more rapid kinetics than observed for STAT1 suggesting different
mechanisms of regulation of
the JAK2 core transcriptional
program. Interestingly, in addition to lowering STAT1 protein
levels, we also observed pSTAT1 reduction following treatment
with BMS-911543 that correlated with pSTAT3 reduction
suggesting a JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 in these
cells. Overall, these ﬁndings deﬁne a JAK2 activation gene-
expression proﬁle, which can be used to guide the clinical
development of compounds such as BMS-911543 in MPNs and
other malignancies associated with aberrant

Discussion

Constitutive JAK2 signaling is a key feature underlying the
pathogenesis of Ph  MPN. This notion is
supported by
numerous studies which have documented gain-of-function
pathway mutations in MPN patients that occur directly in
JAK2,13–16 by ligand-independent activation of MPL/TPOR17,18
or
through the genetic inactivation of negative pathway
regulators.30 Transgenic reconstitution of these genetic lesions
in mouse bone marrow progenitors recapitulated much of the
pathology of human MPN,19 and pharmacological administra-
tion of JAK family inhibitors has been shown to reverse MPN
disease features in these animal models.20,31 Importantly,
clinical testing of JAK inhibitors in MPN patients has demon-
strated symptomatic relief of the disease, including reductions in
spleen size and decreased disease-associated constitutional
symptoms.22 However,
these
inhibitors currently in clinical testing are generally not selective
for JAK2, with several being equipotent to JAK1 and JAK3, which
could manifest in deleterious effects on immune cell function.23
Our studies establish the small molecule, BMS-911543, as a
highly selective inhibitor of JAK2. Dose-dependent anti-prolif-
erative activity of BMS-911543 was only observed in cells
harboring activated JAK2 pathway mutations, and this growth-
inhibitory activity correlated with suppression of constitutive
pSTAT5 in these cell types. We also observed inhibition of TPO-

but not upon IL-2- or
IL-4-stimulated JAK1/JAK3-pSTAT
responses in human T cells. Moreover, at a dose level where
BMS-911543 demonstrated in vivo activity on JAK2V617F end
points, compound administration to antigen-challenged mice
had no effect on antibody generation. In contrast, consistent
with published ﬁndings,23 we found a pan-JAK inhibitor to
potently suppress both antigen-induced IgG and IgM generation
(unpublished ﬁndings),

potential for inhibitors with increased JAK2 selectivity. Interest-
ingly, at higher doses of BMS-911543, decreased IgG, but not
IgM, levels were observed. This observation may suggest a role
of JAK2WT in regulating the IgG to IgM class switch in mice. In
this regard, it is important to note that IL-5, which signals in part
by activating JAK2, has been shown to promote m-g1 switch
recombination and IgG1 secretion.32 Collectively, these cellular
and in vivo ﬁndings are consistent with the selective inhibitory
proﬁle of BMS-911543 for JAK2.

observed similar effects of

We were able to extend these ﬁndings to our in vivo PD models

with cytokine-stimulated platelets harvested from treated
animals. These ﬁndings support that JAK2 pathway alterations
resulting in constitutive signaling impart an increased cellular
dependence upon JAK2, and support the concept that pathway
inhibition will have a differential sensitivity on JAK2V617F to
JAK2WT responses.

Aberrant activation of STAT3 or STAT5 has been reported in a
variety of human cancers and expression of constitutively active
transformation.35
STAT3 is sufﬁcient
Many investigators have utilized JAK inhibitors to examine the
role of JAK family members as molecular targets underlying
malignancies particularly associated with STAT3 activation.
Studies of this type have ascribed a role for JAK2 dependency in
cancer subtypes of breast, prostate, multiple myeloma and B-
cell lymphomas.36–39 We did not observe inhibitory effects of
BMS-911543 in various solid tumor or lymphoma cell lines,
including the B-cell lymphoma cell line, KARPAS1106, which is
reported to have constitutive JAK2 signaling through genetic
inactivation of the pathway negative regulator, SOCS1.28 Unlike
MPNs, our results suggest that persistent STAT3/5 activation
does not confer JAK2 dependence in these other cancers, and
that the lack of selectivity of the inhibitors utilized towards
other JAK family members or kinases outside the family may
underlie the observed effects. Nonetheless, STAT3 activation
is a consistent feature in many solid tumors, and it is interesting
to note the recent observation documenting the dependence
of breast cancer stem-like cells on the JAK2-STAT3 pathway and

To deﬁne the underlying cellular responses to JAK2 inhibition
we identiﬁed a gene-expression signature that was shared
amongst distinct
JAK2 inhibitors and was associated with
cellular growth inhibition. A unifying feature of this transcrip-
tional proﬁle was a core set of regulated genes involved in
cytokine-receptor signaling including CISH, PIM1 and SOCS2,
previously shown to be regulated by JAK2 pathway inhibi-
tion.29,41 In addition to these changes, we also unexpectedly
found STAT1 protein and transcript
levels as well as its
phosphorylation to be downregulated by JAK2 inhibition.
Importantly, the regulation of STAT1 and the associated gene
products was correlated highly with JAK2 on-target pharmacol-
ogy and was shared across multiple inhibitors. Interestingly,
pSTAT1 has been observed in a subpopulation of cells in
extramedullary hematopoietic tissue from a JAK2V617F-positive
PV patient, and the activation of STAT1 has recently been shown
to promote an ET versus a PV phenotype, which indicates the
potential of STAT1 as an additional modifying factor of MPN
disease progression.41,42 These ﬁndings further highlight an
interconnection between STAT1 and JAK2V617F-STAT3/5 signal
transduction, and support the concept that these proteins should
be examined in concert to guide the use of JAK2 inhibitors like
BMS-911543 in MPN and other malignancies.
