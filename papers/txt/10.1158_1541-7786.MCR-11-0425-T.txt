Abstract

Inactivating mutations in the neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene results in the development of
schwannomas and meningiomas. Using NF2-deﬁcient meningioma cells and tumors, together with the normal
cellular counterparts that meningiomas derive, arachnoid cells, we identiﬁed merlin as a novel negative regulator of
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). We now show that merlin positively regulates the kinase activity of mTORC2, a
second functionally distinct mTOR complex, and that downstream phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates,
including Akt, is reduced upon acute merlin deﬁciency in cells. In response to general growth factor stimulation, Akt
signaling is attenuated in merlin RNA interference-suppressed human arachnoid and Schwann cells by mechanisms
mediated by hyperactive mTORC1 and impaired mTORC2. Moreover, Akt signaling is impaired differentially in a
cell type–dependent manner in response to distinct growth factor stimuli. However, contrary to activation of
mTORC1, the attenuated mTORC2 signaling proﬁles exhibited by normal arachnoid and Schwann cells in
response to acute merlin loss were not consistently reﬂected in NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas and schwannomas,
suggesting additional genetic events may have been acquired in tumors after initial merlin loss. This ﬁnding
contrasts with another benign tumor disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, which exhibits attenuated mTORC2
signaling proﬁles in both cells and tumors. Finally, we examined rapamycin, as well as the mTOR kinase inhibitor,
Torin1, targeting both mTOR complexes to identify the most efﬁcacious class of compounds for blocking mTOR-
mediated signaling and proliferation in merlin-deﬁcient meningioma cells. These studies may ultimately aid in the
development of suitable therapeutics for NF2-associated tumors. Mol Cancer Res; 10(5); 649–59. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

Germline mutations of the neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2)
gene are associated with NF2, a severe, inherited tumor
syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular schwanno-
mas, often in combination with other cranial and spinal
schwannomas and meningiomas (1). Biallelic inactivation of
NF2 is also the initiating event in the development of the
majority (60%) of sporadic meningiomas and almost all
schwannomas, tumors that arise from cell types of neural
crest origin. Speciﬁcally, meningiomas and schwannomas

develop respectively from arachnoid cells of the meninges
covering the brain and spinal chord, and from Schwann cells
that ensheath and myelinate peripheral nerves. Meningio-
mas comprise approximately 30% of all brain neoplasms and
although some can often be effectively treated with surgery
and radiation, an important subset remains inoperable or has
recurrence rates of up to 20% over 10 years. To date, most
medical therapies have generally been ineffective indicating
that an improved understanding of the molecular patho-
genesis of these tumors is needed to beneﬁt the development
of new treatments (1).

NF2 encodes the tumor suppressor product, merlin, a
member of the ezrin, radixin, moesin (ERM) family of
membrane-cytoskeletal linker proteins (2, 3), which regu-
lates membrane organization and numerous actin cytoskel-
etal-based cellular processes including cell adhesion, cell–cell
contact, membrane transport, and signal transduction path-
ways (4). Although merlin overlaps functionally in part with
ERM proteins, merlin is distinguished by its tumor sup-
pressor activity. Merlin is suggested to control cell prolifer-
ation by mediating contact inhibition of growth through
mechanisms that include formation of stable adherens junc-
tions or promoting efﬁcient activity, expression, and/or
transport of speciﬁc growth factor receptors (5, 6). Conse-

mitogenic pathways including Ras/mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase (MAPK), Rac, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), Hippo/Mst1 (7–12), as well as E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity (13) in multiple cell types. Although merlin is
implicated in a wide range of cellular activities in different
cell types, it is unclear which of these functions are essential
for inhibiting cell proliferation and tumor growth in men-
ingeal and Schwann cells.

To investigate the mechanism(s) by which merlin loss
results in tumor growth, we have developed in vitro NF2
model systems using human meningeal- and Schwann-
derived cells to more accurately reﬂect the environment of
NF2 tumorigenesis. Using primary human merlin-deﬁcient
meningioma and merlin RNA interference (RNAi)-sup-
pressed arachnoid cells, we recently identiﬁed merlin as a
novel negative regulator of
the mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1; ref. 14), a large multisubunit protein complex
that integrates signals from growth factors, nutrients and
energy to coordinate many key cellular processes including
growth (cell mass gain), and proliferation. mTOR, an
evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr kinase exists in one of 2
distinct functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2,
which consists of discrete sets of proteins and appears to carry
out nonoverlapping functions (15). mTORC1 regulates cell
growth and proliferation by promoting increased translation
and protein synthesis through phosphorylation of effector
proteins, S6 kinase (S6K), and the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; ref. 16). mTORC1
is potently inhibited by the tuberous sclerosis complex
(TSC) tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2 that together
regulate the GTP-loading state of Rheb (Ras homologue
enriched in brain), a key upstream activator of mTORC1
(15, 17). Rapamycin acutely and speciﬁcally inhibits
mTORC1, whereas its effects on mTORC2 are more
variable and generally requires prolonged treatment. In
addition to their differential sensitivity to rapamycin,
mTORC1 and mTORC2 are activated in different ways
and possess distinct substrate speciﬁcity (18).

Although much less is known about the regulation and
function of mTORC2, its best characterized function is the
phosphorylation of Akt on S473 that lies within a hydro-
phobic motif conserved among AGC (protein kinase A, G,
and C) family kinases (19). Similar hydrophobic motifs on
other AGC kinases including PKCa (S657), and the serum
and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK1; S422),
are also phosphorylated by mTORC2 (20, 21). The phos-
phorylation of a second conserved motif on Akt, referred to
as the turn motif (T450 on Akt), is also dependent on
mTORC2. Although the kinase activity of mTORC2 can be
stimulated by growth factors, perhaps downstream of PI3K,
some functions of mTORC2, such as the phosphorylation of
PKCa S657 or Akt T450, are independent of growth factor
signaling (19).

Activation of mTORC1 has been found to negatively
impact Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin or insu-
lin-like growth factor (IGF)1 through negative feedback
loops at multiple levels. Inhibition of PI3K signaling by
mTORC1 can be attributed to the phosphorylation and

degradation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by active
S6K or by inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) receptors through an unknown mechanism (22–
24). In addition, very recent phosphoproteome studies have
identiﬁed Grb10 as an mTORC1 substrate that mediates
feedback inhibition of PI3K and ERK-MAPK pathways (25,
26). The TSC1-TSC2 complex, in addition to its role in
inhibiting mTORC1, was shown to interact with mTORC2
and positively regulates its kinase activity (17). These ﬁnd-
ings help to explain the enhanced Akt inhibition as well as
reduced activation of mTORC2 in TSC1-TSC2 deﬁciency
(27, 28)

Previously, we showed that merlin loss results in hyper-
activation of mTORC1 in vitro and in vivo and that Akt
signaling is impaired in response to insulin stimulation
through an mTORC1-mediated negative feedback loop
(14). Deregulation of mTORC1 signaling in merlin-deﬁ-
cient arachnoid cells is reminiscent of TSC deﬁciency in
cells/tumors suggesting that growth control mechanisms
may be overlapping in TSC and NF2 tumor suppressor
syndromes. Here, we examined the regulation of mTORC2
signaling by merlin in NF2 target cell types and tumors. We
identify both parallels and distinctions in mTORC1/2
downstream signaling events and in negative feedback reg-
ulation to Akt between NF2-deﬁcient Schwann and arach-
noid cells. Our data also indicate that acute merlin suppres-
sion in arachnoid cells may not completely reﬂect the
landscape of NF2-associated meningiomas. In addition, we
evaluated the efﬁcacy in vitro of mTOR and dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors in blocking activated mTOR signaling
and proliferation/survival.

MGH neurooncology tumor repository in accordance with
an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol. Informed
consent was obtained from all study subjects. Tissue was
ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed in formalin to use for
histology and immunohistochemical analyses. NF2-deﬁ-
cient tumors were classiﬁed as sporadic tumors or NF2-
associated tumors based on diagnoses of referring clinicians.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, meningiomas and meningioma
cells described in text refer to benign or World Health
Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma tumors and cells.
Atypical meningioma cells were established from atypical
(WHO grade II) meningiomas.

Cultures of primary meningioma and normal arachnoid
cells from fresh tissues were established as described
previously (29). Primary meningioma cells and the
immortalized arachnoid cell
line, AC007-hTERT (14),
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagles's Medium
(DMEM) with a 4.5 g/L glucose solution containing 15%
FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL strepto-
mycin (full serum medium). Primary normal arachnoid
cells were maintained in a mixture of improved minimum
essential medium with L-glutamine [Richter's Modiﬁed
Medium (Cellgro; Mediatech, Inc.)] supplemented with
15% FBS (Hyclone) insulin (4 mg/L; Gibco Life Tech-
nologies, Inc.) and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (full medium; refs. 14, 29). The immortal-
ized human Schwann cell line, pn02.3, provided by Dr.
Wallace of the University of Florida, was established from
a primary human Schwann cell culture derived from the
sciatic nerve of a healthy, unaffected individual (30). A full
description of this immortalized cell line will be described
in detail elsewhere (H. Li, personal communication;
ref. 31). In brief, Schwann cells were immortalized by
lentiviral-mediated expression of Cdk4 (murine) and tel-
omerase (human, hTERT). The immortalized pn02.3
Schwann cells have been passed well beyond the capacity
of
the original culture to proliferate (p6). They are
uniformly Schwann-like in appearance (spindle-shaped
cells) and express S100 by immunocytochemistry. They
are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
but without neuregulin (GGF2), and seeded in the
absence of matrix-coating on tissue culture plates.

For growth factor stimulation studies, control (scr) and
merlin (m5) knockdown arachnoid cells (AC007-hTERT)
and Schwann cells (pn02.3) were serum-deprived in 0.1%
FBS for 18 hours before growth factor stimulation for 30
minutes at the indicated concentrations. For mTORC2
substrate phosphorylation analyses, cells were serum
deprived for 18 or 24 hours as described in the text, or
cultured in full serum conditions with or without rapa-
mycin (20 nmol/L) for variable time periods (1, 18, or 24
hours) before cell lysis. For signaling studies in response to
mTOR or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor treatment, cells
were cultured in full serum medium in the presence of
rapamycin (50 nmol/L), PI-103 (500 nmol/L), Torin1
(250 nmol/L), or vehicle only (DMSO) for 1 or 24 hours
before cell lysis.

mTORC2 Signaling in NF2

Constructs, virus production, and lentiviral infections
Previously, we employed 3 NF2 short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) speciﬁc for merlin and one nonspeciﬁc shRNA
control in pLKOpuro.1 to establish that merlin suppression
in human arachnoid cells resulted in almost complete loss of
merlin expression and consequent aberrant activation of
mTORC1 signaling (14, 29). Here, we have chosen one
representative NF2 shRNA (m5) and one nonspeciﬁc scram-
ble control (scr) pLKOpuro.1 construct and generated
lentivirus as described previously (29). Isogenic pairs of scr
and m5 merlin knockdown arachnoid and pn02.3 Schwann
cells were established by lentiviral infections at a multiplicity
of infection of 10, and harvested for cell lysates 7 to 10 days
postinfection.

Cell lysis and immunoblotting

Protein lysates were harvested from subconﬂuent cul-
tures because many growth factor–mediated signaling
events are inhibited upon cell conﬂuence. Control (scr)
and NF2/merlin (m5) knockdown arachnoid and pn02.3
Schwann cell
lysates were prepared from subconﬂuent
(80%–90%) cultures in NP-40 lysis buffer (20 mmol/L
Tris pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1%
Nonidet p-40 (NP-40) containing calyculin (50 nmol/L;
Cell Signaling Technology), 1 HALT phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and 1 Complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Subcon-
ﬂuent primary merlin-deﬁcient meninigioma cell cultures
were harvested in RIPA buffer for protein lysates as
described previously (14). Proteins were resolved by SDS-
PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad),
and subjected to immunoblot analysis using indicated anti-
bodies, horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibo-
dies (Cell Signaling Technology) and the enhanced chemi-
luminescence (ECL) detection systems (Amersham Pharma-
cia Biotechnology).

mTORC2 kinase assays

Kinase assays on endogenous mTORC2 were conducted
as described previously with minor modiﬁcations (17, 32).
Near-conﬂuent, 150-mm plates of control (scr) or NF2/
merlin knockdown (m5 RNAi) arachnoid cells were stim-
ulated with EGF (5 ng/mL) for 30 minutes before lysis in 1
mL mTORC lysis buffer (40 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS
{3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-
sulfonate} containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors as
described above, and immunopreciptations conducted with
1.5 mg Rictor or control IgG antibodies. The soluble fraction
of the lysates was precleared for 1 hour with nonspeciﬁc IgG
C and then incubated with the
antibodies with rotation at 4
precipitating antibody for 2 hours. Immunoprecipitates
were captured with protein A/G-agarose (Amersham) for
1.5 hours and then washed 3 times with mTORC lysis buffer
and twice with the Rictor-mTOR kinase buffer (25 mmol/L
HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mmol/L potassium acetate, 2 mmol/L
MgCl2). For mTORC2 kinase reactions, immunoprecipi-
tates were incubated in a ﬁnal volume of 15 mL for 20

containing 500 ng inactivate Akt1/PKB1 (Upstate Biotech-

reaction was stopped by placing samples on ice and imme-
diately adding SDS sample buffer. The supernatant was
removed from protein A/G agarose and analyzed by SDS-
PAGE and immunoblotting as indicated.

Immunohistochemistry

Five benign NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas and 4 vestibular
schwannomas were formalin and parafﬁn embedded (27).
Antigen unmasking was achieved by microwaving in 10
mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0) followed by immersion in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes and 5% goat serum
for 1 hour to block endogenous peroxidase and nonspeciﬁc
antibody binding, respectively. After incubation with the

Cell proliferation/viability assays

Cell proliferation/viability was assessed with the CellTiter-

1,000 cells per well in triplicate and grown overnight. On
days 1 and 4, cells were treated with the appropriate
compounds and viability assays were conducted on days
indicated. Plates were incubated with the CellTiter-Glo
reagent according to manufacturer's suggestions, shaken on
an orbital shaker for 2 minutes, and incubated 10 minutes
further in darkness at room temperature to stabilize the
luminescent signal. Luminescence was detected on a Micro-
LumatPlus LB 96V Luminometer (Berthold Technologies)
and average values depicted as relative luminescent units

Results
General attenuation of Akt phosphorylation in merlin-
deﬁcient arachnoid and Schwann cells

We previously reported that arachnoid cells deﬁcient for
merlin show constitutive phosphorylation of S6, a marker
of mTORC1 activity, but impaired Akt S473 phosphor-
ylation in response to insulin stimulation (14). Attenuated
Akt S473 phosphorylation in merlin knockdown arach-
noid cells is consistent with a negative feedback mecha-
nism mediated by mTORC1/S6K phosphorylation of IRS
proteins and consequent inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling
(15, 33). To determine whether merlin knockdown arach-
noid cells show defective Akt signaling in response to

mTORC2 Signaling in NF2

NF2 tumorigenesis. Consistent with arachnoid cells, merlin
deﬁciency by RNAi in an immortalized human Schwann cell
line (pn02.3) resulted in elevated mTORC1 signaling as
indicated by constitutive S6 phosphorylation. In further
agreement, Akt S473 phosphorylation was not observed in
merlin knockdown Schwann cells under serum-deprived
conditions compared with control cells. In response to
growth factor stimulation by IGF1 and EGF, but not PDGF
or FBS, merlin knockdown Schwann cells exhibited
impaired Akt S473 phosphorylation relative to control cells
(Fig. 1B). The lack of attenuated Akt S473 phosphorylation
in response to PDGF stimulation in merlin-suppressed
Schwann cells is in sharp contrast to merlin knockdown
arachnoid cells. Our data are in agreement with a general loss
of Akt stimulation observed characteristically in TSC-null
cells in response to a variety of growth factors including those
that signal independent of IRS proteins (27). These ﬁndings
indicate that in addition to mTORC1/S6K-dependent
feedback inhibition of IRS, other mechanism(s) may be
functional in merlin-deﬁcient NF2 target cells to dampen
Akt signaling.

Although ERK (T202/Y204) phosphorylation is elevated
in serum-deprived conditions in merlin-deﬁcient arachnoid
and Schwann cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1A and
B), we and others previously showed it was not responsible
for mTORC1 activation (14, 34). Interestingly, we observed
an increase in ERK phosphorylation in merlin-suppressed
Schwann cells in response to IGF and PDGF stimulation.
To assess whether this increase in ERK phosphorylation
might be due to disruption of receptor signaling, we exam-
ined total and phosphorylated levels of the PDGF receptor
beta (PDGFRb) and IGF1 receptor beta (IGF1Rb) in
control and NF2 RNAi Schwann cells. In response to PDGF
stimulation, NF2 knockdown Schwann cells showed an
increase in both total and phosphorylated PDGFRb levels
compared with control cells. This ﬁnding is in agreement
with previous reports that showed elevated PDGFRb levels
in schwannoma cells and tissues compared with Schwann
cells (35, 36), and that schwannoma cells exhibit elevated
ERK1/2 activation compared with Schwann cells in response
to PDGF stimulation (36). On the contrary, we noted a
decrease in total and phosphorylated IGF1Rb levels in
response to IGF1 stimulation in NF2 knockdown Schwann
cells compared with control cells suggesting that activation of
IGFR1b is not responsible for ERK activation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1).

Loss of merlin leads to a decrease in mTORC2 signaling
and kinase activity

To determine whether decreased mTORC2 signaling
contributes to general Akt attenuation in response to growth
factors in merlin-deﬁcient arachnoid and Schwann cells, we
examined phosphorylation sites of several mTORC2-depen-
dent substrates of the AGC family of kinases including Akt
(S473 and T450), PKCa (S657), and SGK1 (S422).
Because mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif
of Akt S473 and SGK1 S422 in a PI3K-dependent manner,
and Akt T450 and PKCa S657 sites independent of growth

factor signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of
mTORC2 substrates in the absence and presence of full
serum growth conditions.

Consistent with our earlier ﬁndings, Akt S473 phosphor-
ylation was not observed under serum-deprived conditions
in either control or merlin-suppressed arachnoid and
Schwann cells. Although no difference in Akt phosphory-
lation was detected in NF2-deﬁcient cells in response to
acute serum stimulation (Fig. 1), steady-state levels of Akt
phosphorylation were reduced in these cells grown in full
serum (Fig. 2A and B). Prolonged rapamycin treatment (18
hours) had varying effects on the 2 cell types, increasing Akt-
S473 phosphorylation in arachnoid cells but decreasing it in
Schwann cells. Surprisingly, we detected increased phos-
phorylation of N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1
(NDRG1) T346, a speciﬁc marker for SGK1 signaling
(19, 21), in both merlin knockdown arachnoid and Schwann
cells compared with controls. In a growth factor–indepen-
dent manner, we observed reduced levels of Akt T450 and
PKCa S657 phosphorylation upon merlin suppression in
arachnoid and Schwann cells compared with controls. In
addition, PKCa total protein levels were reduced in merlin
knockdown cells reﬂecting the signiﬁcance of this residue to
PKCa stability (19). Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate
that merlin regulates mTORC1 as well as mTORC2
signaling.

is due

To more fully understand whether the attenuated Akt
phosphorylation in merlin-deﬁcient
to
mTORC1 as well as mTORC2 signaling, we treated NF2
knockdown arachnoidal and Schwann cells with rapamycin
for short-term (1 hour) and long-term (24 hours) time
periods, which speciﬁcally blocks mTORC1 signaling (1
hour), or mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling (24 hours). In
response to short-term rapamycin treatment, arachnoidal
cells show an increase in Akt S473 phosphorylation indi-
cating relief of
the negative feedback regulation from
mTORC1-S6K signaling (Fig. 2C). An increase in Akt
S473 phosphorylation was not observed in Schwann cells
indicating cell type–dependent differences in response to
rapamycin (Fig. 2D). In response to long-term exposure to
rapamycin, Schwann cells, unlike arachnoidal cells, exhib-
ited a further decrease in Akt S473 phosphorylation indi-
cating that mTORC2 assembly may be affected in Schwann
cells and not in arachnoid cells (Fig. 2C and D). Our data are
in agreement with the established notion that long-term
rapamycin treatment does not always lead to the total loss of
mTORC2 activity, and that mTORC2 assembly is not
completely blocked in all cell types (18).

To determine whether the attenuation of mTORC2
signaling observed in merlin knockdown arachnoid cells
and Schwann cells could be due to diminished mTORC2
kinase activity, we directly assayed mTORC2 kinase activity.
Endogenous mTORC2 was isolated from control and mer-
lin knockdown arachnoid cell lysates by immunoprecipitat-
ing Rictor, and its kinase activity was assayed using an
exogenous Akt1 substrate. Similar amounts of mTOR was
immunoprecipitated with Rictor in control and merlin-
deﬁcient cells stimulated with EGF, however, mTORC2

Heterogeneous expression of PKCa and Akt S473
phosphorylation in merlin-deﬁcient meningiomas and
schwannomas

Our data indicate that acute merlin downregulation by
RNAi in NF2 target cell types such as normal arachnoid and
Schwann cells results in elevated mTORC1 signaling and
decreased mTORC2 signaling. We have shown earlier that
mTORC1 signaling is activated in NF2-deﬁcient meningi-
omas and schwannomas (14). To determine whether NF2
tumors exhibit reduced mTORC2 signaling, we examined

PKCa and phospho-Akt S473 expression levels in merlin-
deﬁcient meningioma and schwannoma tumors compared
with normal arachnoid tissue by immunohistochemical
staining. We detected heterogeneity in both PKCa and
phospho-Akt S473 expression levels across multiple
benign meningioma (n ¼ 5) and schwannoma (n ¼ 4)
samples compared with TSC AML (Fig. 4 and Table 1).
Previous studies showed that TSC AMLs display high
phospho-S6 levels but do not express detectable levels of
PKCa or phospho-Akt (27). PKCa immunoreactivity was
moderate to strongly positive in normal arachnoid tissue as
well as benign meningiomas and schwannomas. Weak to
moderate levels of phospho-Akt S473 positivity were
detected in both normal arachnoid and benign meningi-
oma samples relative to TSC AML tissue. In schwanno-
mas, however, phospho-Akt S473 staining was uniformly
reduced across tumor samples relative to normal arachnoid
and meningioma tissues, and more comparable with TSC
AMLs. The lack of detectable Akt S473 phosphorylation

Figure 3. mTORC2 kinase activity is impaired in cells deﬁcient for
merlin. Control (con) and merlin knockdown (NF2) arachnoid cells were
serum deprived (0.1% FBS) overnight and stimulated with EGF
(5 ng/mL) for 30 minutes before lysis and immunoprecipitation (IP) with
control IgG or Rictor antibodies (Ab). mTORC2 kinase activity was
assessed in these immunoprecipitates using inactive Akt1 as a
substrate. Immunoblotting for mTOR, Rictor, phospho-Akt (S473),
Akt, and merlin was conducted with appropriate antibodies. B, the
average relative phospho-Akt (S473) levels for control (con) and NF2
RNAi samples were quantiﬁed from 2 independent mTORC2 kinase
assays. Phospho-Akt (S473) levels were adjusted to total inactive Akt
substrate levels, and phospho-Akt (S473) levels from NF2 RNAi
samples (49.9%) were represented as percentage values relative to
con RNAi levels that were arbitrarily set to 100%.

in schwannoma tissue by immunohistochemistry is in
agreement with the study of Ammoun and colleagues
(2010), which reports that Akt phosphorylation was not
observed in vestibular schwannoma specimens (n ¼ 10) by
phosphokinase proﬁling array analysis (37). However,
other earlier studies showed positive Akt S473 phosphor-
ylation in vestibular
and/or
increased Akt protein levels (38, 39). These differences
could be due to tumor heterogeneity or variations in
sensitivity of the methods/antibodies employed. Our data
show that
reduced signaling events downstream of
mTORC2 in response to acute merlin suppression in
arachnoid and Schwann cells are not necessarily reﬂective
of mTORC2 signaling in merlin-deﬁcient meningiomas
and schwannomas with chronic merlin loss.

mTOR signaling and proliferation in merlin-deﬁcient
meningioma cells in response to mTOR and dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors

Treatments directed against mTOR signaling pathways
have shown promise in the management of solid tumors
and therefore may constitute a potential target for the
treatment of NF2 meningiomas. However, rapamycin and
its analogs effectively inhibit S6K phosphorylation, but
not 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and therefore incompletely
inhibit mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis (40). In
addition, a major concern is that rapalogs also cause
activation of prosurvival and oncogenic pathways such as
PI3K/Akt. These trepidations have fueled the develop-
ment of mTOR kinase inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR kinase
inhibitors. Because merlin-deﬁcient meningiomas exhibit
activation of mTORC2 as detected by Akt S473 phos-
phorylation (Fig. 4), we believe that these cells might be
more sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors, which are
efﬁcient in inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2
complexes. Therefore, in addition to rapamycin, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of the dual PI3K/Akt–mTOR
inhibitor, PI-103, as well as the ATP-competitive inhib-
itor, Torin1, targeting both mTOR complexes (41), in
blocking mTOR-dependent signaling and proliferation/
prosurvival pathways
in merlin-deﬁcient meningioma
cells. In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we evaluated the
effect of short (1 hour) and prolonged exposures (24
hours) of mTOR or P13K/mTOR inhibition on primary
benign and atypical meningioma cells by western analysis.
Inhibition of S6 (S240/244) or S6K (T389) phosphory-
lation was observed in merlin-deﬁcient benign or WHO
grade I meningioma cells (Fig. 5A and C), and atypical
(WHO grade II; Fig. 5B and D) meningioma cells in
response to low doses (50 nmol/L; ref. 41) of rapamycin at
both time points, showing that rapamycin effectively
suppresses the mTORC1 pathway in these cells in vitro.
As expected, blocking mTORC1 with rapamycin resulted
in elevated Akt S473 phosphorylation above levels of
untreated (vehicle) cells under short (Fig. 5A and B) and
long (Fig. 5C and D) treatment periods.

Torin1, used at a concentration (250 nmol/L) reported to
overcome hyperactivated PI3K due to the negative feedback
between mTORC1 and PI3K under conditions of pro-
longed mTORC1 inhibition (>5 hours; ref. 41), inhibited
S6 or S6K phosphorylation at both treatment times, similar
to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5A–D). However, in contrast
to rapamycin, Torin1, effectively blocked Akt S473 phos-
phorylation at both treatment periods.

Similar to rapamycin and Torin1, PI-103 (500 nmol/L)
inhibited S6 or S6K phosphorylation after short exposure
periods (Fig. 5A and B), but in contrast, failed to sufﬁ-
ciently inhibit S6 or S6K phosphorylation after prolonged
time periods in meningioma cells regardless of tumor
grade (Fig. 5C and D). Likewise, PI-103 efﬁciently
blocked Akt S473 phosphorylation after short exposure
times in all cells examined, but was ineffective in inhibit-
ing Akt phosphorylation after a prolonged exposure peri-

Figure 4. Normal arachnoid and benign (WHO grade I) merlin-deﬁcient
meningioma and vestibular schwannoma sections were immunostained
for PKCa and phospho-Akt (S473) expression. Normal arachnoid, benign
merlin-deﬁcient meningioma, and vestibular schwannoma tissues exhibit
similar, moderate to strong PKCa expression. Phospho-Akt (S473) (pAkt
S473) staining is weak to moderate in normal arachnoid and meningioma
tissue, and negative to weak in vestibular schwannomas. Data are
representative of results for 5 benign merlin-deﬁcient meningiomas and 4
vestibular schwannomas (Table 1). Sections of TSC AML (negative
controls) show negative to weak PKCa and phospho-Akt (S473) staining
consistent with previous reports (27). Arrow indicates normal arachnoid
"cap" cells [magniﬁcation, 20, except PKCa staining of benign
meningioma and TSC AML (40)].

phosphorylation of Akt and S6K/S6 after 24 hours may
be, at least in part, due to the short half-life and rapid
metabolism of this drug that has been reported in vivo
(42).

We next evaluated the effect of rapamycin or Torin1 on
cell proliferation/viability of merlin-deﬁcient meningioma
cells (n ¼ 4) treated over a period of 6 days. In comparison
with untreated cells, we observed that Torin1 (250 nmol/L)
was most effective in inhibiting proliferation of all menin-
gioma cells tested, and rapamycin (50 nmol/L) signiﬁcantly
reduced the rate of proliferation. These data are provided
in a representative growth curve of a benign meningioma
(Fig. 6A). When we compared the average proliferative rates
of 2 independent cultures of benign meningioma or atypical
meningioma cells at one time point (day 7), we observed that
Torin1 elicited the greatest inhibitory response in all cell
lines (Fig. 6B).

Discussion

Our previous work showed that merlin deﬁciency in NF2
target cells results in aberrant activation of mTORC1-
mediated signaling as well as attenuation of Akt S473
phosphorylation upon insulin treatment (14), consistent
with negative feedback regulation of IRS1 by activated
mTORC1 (22, 23, 43). In this study, we show that Akt
S473 phosphorylation is
impaired in merlin-deﬁcient
human arachnoid cells in response to stimulation with
growth factors such as EGF and PDGF, and in merlin-
deﬁcient human Schwann cells, in response to EGF, but not
PDGF. These results clearly show that merlin-deﬁcient
arachnoid and Schwann cells may differ from each other in
PDGF-mediated signaling. Attenuation of Akt S473 phos-
phorylation by growth factors other than insulin/IGF sug-
gest that in NF2, similar to TSC, more than one mechanism
could be operative to downregulate Akt activation. Further-
more, recent studies have shown that mTORC1 activation,
functioning through S6K phosphorylates Rictor to inhibit
mTORC2 (44, 45).

Here, we examined signaling downstream of mTORC2,
including phosphorylation of Akt (S473, T450) as well as
other well-characterized substrates of mTORC2 such as
PKCa (S657) and NDRG1, the latter being a speciﬁc
readout for mTORC2 and SGK1 activation (21). The
observed decrease in phospho-AKT (S473, T450) and
phospho-PKCa (S657) in merlin-suppressed arachnoid and
Schwann cells resemble TSC1- or TSC2-deﬁcient cells (27).

103 (P; 500 nmol/L), rapamycin (R, 50

vehicle (-; DMSO) for 1 hour (A and B)
or 24 hours (C and D). Arrow

The decrease in mTORC2 kinase activity observed in merlin
knockdown cells is consistent with growth factor–indepen-
dent targets of mTORC2 (Akt T450, PKCa S657) being
defective in these cells. Future studies are necessary to
understand the precise molecular mechanisms of mTORC2
regulation by NF2 and whether this regulation is dependent
or independent of TSC proteins. It is intriguing that con-
trary to other mTORC2 targets, NDRG1 is aberrantly
activated (independent of growth factors) in merlin knock-
down arachnoid and Schwann cells. Interestingly, a very
recent study has shown that knockout of Protor-1, an
interactor of Rictor results in a decrease in phosphorylation
of SGK and its physiologic substrate NDRG1, without

inﬂuencing the phosphorylation of Akt and PKCa at their
hydrophobic or turn motifs (46). It is therefore tempting to
speculate whether Protor-1 is
involved in mediating
NDRG1 activation in merlin deﬁciency, and further studies
are necessary to understand the mechanism and conse-
quences of NDRG1 activation in merlin-deﬁcient cells.

Our results suggest that primary meningioma cells and
meningioma tumors with long-term (chronic) loss of merlin
may exhibit heterogeneity in mTORC2 signaling when
compared with acute loss of merlin achieved by RNAi in
control normal arachnoid and Schwann cells in vitro. Phos-
phorylation of Akt S473 is not dramatically reduced in
meningiomas when compared with normal arachnoid tissue.

However,
interestingly, phospho-Akt S473 staining in
schwannomas is dramatically reduced, more closely resem-
bling the staining pattern of TSC tumors than meningiomas.
The lack of strong attenuation of mTORC2 signaling,
particularly Akt S473 phosphorylation, which is a driver of
cell proliferation and survival
in primary meningiomas,
suggests that either compensation mechanisms exist or
additional genetic events cooperate with merlin loss in
meningiomas. This is in agreement with a recent study,
which elegantly documents frequent chromosome altera-
tions in NF2-associated grade 1 meningiomas (47). We also
speculate that similar to TSC lesions, the lack of Akt S473
phosphorylation in schwannomas may explain the benign
nature of these tumors as well as the difﬁculty in establishing
cells from them in culture. On the contrary, the atypical
features commonly seen in benign meningiomas may be
elicited by additional genetic events and/or Akt activation.
Clinical trials with the allosteric inhibitor, rapamycin and
its analogs, known as rapalogs, are shown to be effective for
various TSC-associated benign tumors including subepen-
dymal giant cell astrocytomas (48, 49). However, the feed-
back activation of oncogenic pathways by rapamycin and
rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 has led to
the development of kinase inhibitors of mTOR as well as
dual PI3K/Akt and mTOR inhibitors (50). We tested the
efﬁcacy of mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin; an ATP-com-
petitive mTOR inhibitor Torin1, which is shown to be a
potent inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex;
and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 on primary
benign and atypical meningioma cells. We conclude that
Torin1 is more effective in blocking mTORC1 and Akt
activation in meningioma cells in vitro than rapamycin and
PI-103 and more effective than rapamycin in inhibiting cell

proliferation. Although benign in nature, we believe that
heterogeneity exists in NF2-associated tumors adding com-
plexity to signaling events. Therefore, therapeutic strategies
employing Torin1 or equivalent mTOR kinase inhibitors in
combination with other pathway inhibitors may be prom-
ising for treating NF2.
