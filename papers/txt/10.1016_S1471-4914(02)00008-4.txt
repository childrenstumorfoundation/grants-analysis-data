Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal domi-
nant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene,
leading to a variety of abnormalities in cell growth and
differentiation, and to learning disabilities. The protein
encoded by NF1, neuroﬁbromin, has several biochemi-
cal functions and is expressed in a variety of different
cell populations. Hence, determination of the molecular
and cellular mechanisms that underlie the different NF1
symptoms is difﬁcult. However, studies using mouse
models of NF1 are beginning to unravel the mechan-
isms that underlie the various symptoms associated
with the disease. This knowledge will aid the develop-
ment of treatments for the different pathological pro-
cesses associated with NF1.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is a common autosomal
dominant disorder, affecting approximately one in every
3500 individuals (for reviews see [1,2]), and is one of the
most common single-gene disorders inﬂuencing neurologi-
cal function in humans [3]. Mutations in the NF1 gene
result in abnormal cell growth and differentiation, with a
variety of symptoms, typically including benign neuro-
ﬁbromas, hyperpigmentation of melanocytes, and hamar-
tomas of the iris [1,2]. The benign neuroﬁbromas can
develop into malignant peripheral-nerve-sheath tumors
(MPNSTs). Furthermore, in the brain, NF1 mutations can
result in astrogliosis and astrogliomas, and in learning
disabilities that occur in 40 – 60% of patients with NF1
[4,5]. Visual-spatial function appears to be most compro-
mised, although problems with language skills, executive
function, attention and motor coordination are also
common (for reviews see [4,5]).

Effects of NF1 mutations in humans and mice
The NF1 gene encodes a 250 kDa protein called neuro-
ﬁbromin, which has several known biochemical functions,
including activation of the Ras GTPase [6–8], modulation
of adenylyl cyclase [9,10], and microtubule association [11]
(Fig. 1). The human and mouse forms of neuroﬁbromin are
highly homologous (98% sequence similarity) [12], as are
the promoter sequences of the gene, suggesting that both
the biochemistry of the protein and the transcriptional
regulation of the gene are conserved across species [12,13].
Although investigation of all the symptoms of NF1 in a
single mouse model has proven difﬁcult, the ability to

dissociate some of the symptoms from others in particular
mouse models (Table 1) has often been an advantage in
studies of the disease. The effects of NF1 mutations in
humans and mice show interesting parallels. For example,
in mice and probably in humans, the complete loss of
neuroﬁbromin is lethal [14,15]. Also, NF1 mutations lead
to tumor formation in both humans and mice. Aged mice

cytomas, and myeloid leukemias, two phenotypes observed
in NF1 patients. Moreover, mice carrying Nf1 2/2
mutations in particular cell populations develop neuro-
ﬁbromas [16,17] and mice that carry linked (cis) mutations
in Nf1 and p53 develop soft tissue sarcomas, namely
MPNSTs [16,18]. Skin pigmentation problems have also
been observed in mice and humans [19]. Chemically
þ/2 mice with either a skin cancer

initiator or a tumor promoter results in abnormalities in
skin pigmentation and proliferation [20]. In addition, NF1
mutations result in abnormal brain function in both
species. As described for NF1 patients [21], mice carrying

Mouse models of the cell growth and differentiation
abnormalities in NF1
The NF1 gene was cloned in 1990 [26–28] and soon
afterwards mice were generated carrying a null mutation
of this gene [14,15]. Homozygous Nf1-mutant mice display

ganglia, and die embryonically [15]. Mice heterozygous

ﬁbromas that are characteristic of NF1, which could
indicate that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is necessary for
neuroﬁbroma formation. To investigate this hypothesis,
Cichowski et al. generated chimeric mice, composed partly
of Nf1 2/2 cells, and these mice do develop neuroﬁbromas
[16]. However, several cell types are homozygous for
mutant Nf1 in these mice and, hence, it is difﬁcult to
determine which cell type(s) are involved in the formation
of neuroﬁbromas. A recent study has addressed this problem
by showing that mice with a homozygous null mutation
speciﬁcally in Schwann cells (Nf1 ﬂox/2; Krox20-cre) can
develop neuroﬁbromas [17]. This work also suggested that,
in addition to homozygosity in Schwann cells,
the
development of neuroﬁbromas requires heterozygosity in
the surrounding cells [17]. Neuroﬁbromas are usually
benign, but they can become malignant; for example, mice
carrying linked mutations in Nf1 and p53 develop
MPNSTs [16,18].

Skin pigmentation problems and epithelial carcino-
genesis are commonly associated with NF1 [2]. Interest-
þ/2 mice have been shown to have abnormal

responses to skin wounding [19]. To determine if these
mice are also more susceptible to pigmentation abnorm-

papillomas had mutations in the H-Ras gene, suggesting

spatial learning) only occurs in ,60% of the Nf1
[22]. This is consistent with the incidence of the spatial
learning deﬁcits in these mice [24], suggesting that the
astrogliosis and the learning deﬁcits could be associated.
However, mice lacking exon 23a of Nf1 (Nf1 23a2/2) do not
have astrogliosis, but do show learning deﬁcits [25].
Interestingly, complete deletion of Nf1 speciﬁcally in glia
[Nf1 GFAP conditional knockout (CKO)] [29], or speciﬁcally
in neurons [Nf1 SynI knockout (KO)] [23], is sufﬁcient to
cause astrogliosis, indicating that disruption of neuro-
ﬁbromin in either cell type can contribute to this problem.
Also, heterozygosity for Nf1 and p53, or Nf1 and Rb,
confers a signiﬁcant growth advantage to astrocytes
(2.5-fold) [30]. Additionally, loss of both Nf1 and p53 result
in blastoglioma formation [31]. Surprisingly, complete
deletion of Nf1 speciﬁcally in astrocytes (Nf1 GFAP CKO)
[29] is not sufﬁcient to produce astrogliomas, a frequently
observed benign tumor type in NF1 patients.

Mouse models of the learning disabilities associated
with NF1
Despite the obvious differences between mice and humans,
molecular and cellular cognitive studies have revealed
remarkable similarities in the learning deﬁcits caused by
NF1 mutations in the two species. First, the NF1 mutation
seems to affect some brain functions more than others. For
example, visual-spatial learning [24], attention and motor
coordination are all impaired, whereas various forms of
learning, such as classical conditioning, seem to be intact.
Second, only 40–60% of carriers of the mutation are
affected, and remedial training can alleviate the learning
deﬁcits [4,24]. Third, the severity of the NF1 phenotype is
affected by genetic variation, which exacerbates the

problem in NF1 patients without having a noticeable
impact on normal siblings [24,32,33]. Consistent with this,
it was shown that a heterozygous mutation of the
N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) increases the
þ/2 mice without
severity of the learning deﬁcits in Nf1
affecting learning in littermate controls [24]. Also, genetic
background impacts on the incidence of learning dis-
þ/2 mice [34]. These similarities suggest
abilities in Nf1
that mouse models could be useful for investigating the
mechanisms that underlie the learning deﬁcits associated
with NF1.

The range of neurological symptoms associated with
NF1 is vast and, hence, it is not clear whether the learning
deﬁcits associated with NF1 are caused by adult brain
dysfunction, undetected tumors or neuro-developmental
problems. However, results from recent work using mouse
models have helped to clarify this matter. An interesting
indication comes from studies of mice that carry a
homozygous deletion of the alternatively spliced exon
23a of Nf1 (Nf1 23a2/2) [25]. This exon encodes 63 base
pairs (21 amino acids) within the GTPase activating
protein (GAP)-related domain. Exclusion of exon 23a
produces the type-I isoform of Nf1, whereas inclusion of
this exon yields type II. The type-II isoform has a greater
afﬁnity for Ras, but lower GAP activity, than type I [35,36].
Nf1 23a2/2 mice are physically normal, and do not show
any neural-crest development abnormality or increased
tumor predisposition [25]. However, these mice do have
learning impairments in spatial tasks (water maze and
contextual discrimination) [25], much like the heterozy-
gous null mutants [24,32]. These results show that the
learning deﬁcits can occur in the absence of tumor
predisposition or neuro-developmental problems. Further-
more, mice lacking neuroﬁbromin solely in neurons
(Nf1 SynI KO without runty phenotype) show no increase
in predisposition to tumor formation but do have
learning deﬁcits (R.M. Costa, PhD thesis, University of
Oporto, 2002).

What, then, are the molecular alterations that underlie
these learning disabilities? Neuroﬁbromin has several
known biochemical functions. For example, it has a GAP
domain that accelerates the inactivation of Ras by
stimulating its GTPase activity [6–8]. In addition, studies
in Drosophila melanogaster and in mice have shown that
neuroﬁbromin modulates the activity of the rutabaga-
encoded adenylyl cyclase (AC) [10,37], an enzyme crucial
for cAMP signaling. Neuroﬁbromin has also been shown to
associate with microtubules [11], suggesting that it is
involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways
in the brain. All of these biochemical pathways are
important for brain function, and have been implicated
in synaptic plasticity and in learning and memory.
However, the question remains as to which of these
signaling pathways are crucial for the cognitive deﬁcits
associated with NF1.

Studies in D. melanogaster showed that homozygosity
for mutation of Nf1 causes associative learning deﬁcits and
that these deﬁcits are dependent on the rutabaga-encoded
AC [10]. Furthermore, the cAMP pathway is crucial for
memory formation in a variety of vertebrate and invert-
ebrate species [38], and AC activity is also impaired in cells

http://tmm.trends.com

from (lethal) homozygous mutant-Nf1 mice [37]. However,
in cells from heterozygous null mice, which have learning
deﬁcits, AC activity is indistinguishable from that of wild-
type animals [37], whereas the Ras-controlled mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is upregulated
([39], R.M. Costa, PhD thesis, University of Oporto, 2002).
These data suggest that the ability of neuroﬁbromin to
regulate AC might be important for symptoms that require
a loss of heterozygosity, whereas the Ras-GAP activity of
neuroﬁbromin might be crucial for phenotypes that are
manifest
in heterozygosity, such as learning deﬁcits.
Interestingly, however, the circadian phenotype of Nf1
homozygous null mutants in Drosophila can be rescued by
Ras mutations [40].

In humans, a mutation in the NF1 gene that speciﬁcally
abolishes the Ras-GAP function of neuroﬁbromin, without
affecting its ability to bind Ras, was shown to cause
multiple NF1 symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction
[41], suggesting that loss of the GAP function underlies the
learning deﬁcits.

In mice, recent studies showed that the spatial learning
þ/2 mutants can be rescued by two
impairments in Nf1
different genetic manipulations that decrease Ras levels,
indicating that increased Ras activity is the cause for the
learning deﬁcits [42]. In agreement, the learning deﬁcits of
þ/2 mice can also be reversed pharmacologically, using
Nf1
a farnesyl-transferase inhibitor (FTI), which indirectly
reduces the amount of active Ras [42]. This FTI experi-
ment also indicates that the learning deﬁcits of Nf1
mutant mice can be reversed in the adult, a ﬁnding of
crucial importance for the development of treatments for
the learning disabilities associated with NF1. In addition,
Nf1 23a2/2 mice, which lack the alternatively spliced exon
23 (which modulates the GAP activity of Nf1) have
learning disabilities [25].

Several other genetic and pharmacological studies have
substantiated the role of Ras signaling in synaptic
plasticity, and learning and memory [43–45].

Taken together, these studies suggest that either
abnormally high or low Ras activity can disrupt learning,
indicating that precise Ras modulation by neuroﬁbromin
is crucial for learning and memory. It will be important to
determine which Ras effectors (Fig. 1) are crucial for the
learning deﬁcits associated with NF1. Also, in light of the
Drosophila studies described above [10,37], it will be
important to determine whether, in mammals, regulation
of the cAMP pathway by neuroﬁbromin plays a role in the
occurrence of learning disabilities. If so, it would be
interesting to observe whether different behavioral
impairments can be attributed to abnormalities in either
the cAMP or the Ras pathways, or whether these two
pathways interact during learning in a manner regulated
by neuroﬁbromin.

The results of the experiments described above suggest
that the learning deﬁcits associated with NF1 result from
adult brain dysfunction caused by increased Ras activity.

thought to underlie learning and memory [46]. Nf1
mutant mice show learning deﬁcits in the hidden version
of the water maze, a spatial navigation task that is
dependent on hippocampal function [47]. In humans, the
hippocampus seems to be crucial for the acquisition of new
declarative memories [48,49]. Electrophysiological studies
þ/2 mice
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of Nf1
showed that LTP is impaired when induced using a theta-
burst stimulation (TBS) protocol [42], which mimics the in
vivo activity of hippocampal neurons during exploratory
behavior [50]. Further electrophysiological analysis showed
þ/2 mice have increased g-aminobutyric acid
that the Nf1
(GABA) inhibition in the hippocampus, and suggested that
this increased inhibition is the cause of the LTP deﬁcits
[42]. Remarkably, as with the learning deﬁcits, both
the increased GABA inhibition and the LTP deﬁcits of
the Nf1-mutant mice can be reversed by manipulations
that decrease Ras activity [42].

Ras has been shown to modulate chloride currents in
adrenal gland cells [51]. The data described above suggest
that Ras might also modulate inhibitory currents in the
central nervous system. Interestingly, whereas neuro-
ﬁbromin affects LTP through modulation of GABA-
mediated inhibition, H-Ras [52] and even other GAPs,
such as Syn-GAP [53], have been implicated in LTP via
their modulation of excitatory neurotransmission. Neuro-
ﬁbromin is also localized at excitatory synapses and
interacts with the NMDAR in a large post-synaptic
complex [54]. Furthermore, in excitatory synapses, Ras
mediates synaptic delivery of AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-
5,7-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptors during
LTP [55]. Hence, neuroﬁbromin might modulate excitatory
as well as inhibitory synaptic function.

The role(s) of neuroﬁbromin and Ras at inhibitory
synapses are not yet known. Pre-synaptically, Ras could
modulate neurotransmitter (e.g. GABA) release through
MAPK phosphorylation of synapsin I [56,57]. Post-
synaptically, Ras might mediate the membrane insertion
of particular GABA subunits or modulate the phosphoryl-
ation state of the receptors, as it does in excitatory
synapses. Another possibility is that GABA re-uptake is
altered by Nf1 mutations. Using a combination of genetic
(deletion of Nf1 in particular cell types) and electrophysio-
logical studies,

GABA-mediated inhibition in the hippocampus has been
shown to cause deﬁcits in spatial learning and synaptic
plasticity in rodents [58,59]. Furthermore, a reduction in
synaptic inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons follows
both LTP induction [60], and acquisition of the hidden
version of the water maze [61]. Inhibition has been
proposed to control the discharge rate and the collective
activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons, both during explora-
tory activity and at rest [62,63]. Therefore, it is plausible
that the increase in GABA inhibition, and related synaptic

observation that the spatial-learning deﬁcits, the inhi-
bition and the synaptic plasticity alterations, are rescued
by the same Ras manipulations. Further studies in
humans and in rodents will help to unravel the effects of
increased Ras activity and GABA inhibition on the
ensemble activity of neurons during learning.

Conclusions
Studies employing mouse models of NF1 have been crucial
in investigating the pathophysiology of different aspects of
the disease, such as problems with cellular differentiation,
tumor formation and learning. These studies have been
essential in identifying the cell types, the cellular pro-
cesses and the molecular pathways that are altered by Nf1
mutations. This knowledge might have important impli-
cations for the development of treatments for NF1.
