Abstract.  Schwannomas  and  grade  I  meningiomas  are 
non-metastatic neoplasms that share the common mutation of 
gene NF2. They usually appear in neurofibromatosis type 2 
patients. Currently, there is no drug treatment available 
for both tumors, thus the use of wide expression technolo-
gies is crucial to identify therapeutic targets. Affymetrix 
Human Gene 1.0 ST was used to test global gene expression 
in 22 meningiomas, 31 schwannomas and, as non-tumoral 
controls, 3 healthy meningeal tissues, 8 non-tumoral nerves 
and 1 primary Schwann cell culture. A non-stringent P-value 
cut-off and fold change were used to establish deregulated 
genes. We identified a subset of genes that were upregulated 
in meningiomas and schwannomas when compared to their 
respectively healthy tissues, including PDGFD, CDH1 and 
SLIT2. Thus, these genes should be thoroughly studied as 
targets in a possible combined treatment.
Introduction
Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann 
cells. They typically appear in the vestibulocochlear nerve and 
are considered to be grade I tumors; approximately 95% are

unilateral and present sporadically, whereas 5% are associated 
with neurofibromatosis type 2 syndrome (NF2). Patients with 
NF2 present with bilateral schwannomas and other tumors, 
frequently meningiomas, which originate from arachnoid 
cells, and account for 20% of all primary intracranial tumors. 
The current classification of meningiomas by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) includes three grades: 90% are classi-
fied as grade I tumors; ~8-9% are atypical grade II tumors; 
and 1-2% are anaplastic/malignant grade III tumors (1). 
Meningiomas have a recurrence rate of 18, 40 and 80% for 
grade I, II and III, respectively.
Preliminary cytogenetic studies have demonstrated the 
absence of one chromosome 22 in both neoplasms  (2,3), 
thus suggesting a common genetic origin for at least some 
subgroups of these neurogenic tumors. Subsequently, NF2 gene 
(located at 22q12.2) inactivation was found to be due to several 
mechanisms, such as mutations or allelic loss due to mono-
somy or deletion of chromosome 22, accounting for up to 66% 
in schwannomas (4) and 18-50% in sporadic meningiomas, 
depending on the histopathological subtypes (5). In addition to 
the characteristic chromosome 22 loss, secondary alterations 
such as 1p deletions have been described in both tumor types, 
and these alterations appear to be related to tumor progression 
in meningiomas (6-8). Although DNA methylation studies 
on these neurogenic tumors have revealed the non-random 
involvement of this mechanism in the inactivation of some 
tumor-related genes (9-11), controversial data are available 
concerning the epigenetic (through CpG island aberrant meth-
ylation) NF2 inactivation in both neoplasms (12-16). Indeed, 
recent studies on genome-wide methylation suggest that this 
mechanism is associated with malignant transformation in 
meningiomas, and allows for the epigenetic subclassification 
of this tumor (17,18).
Global exome sequencing in meningiomas showed that, 
in grade I tumors, NF2 gene alteration (by mutation and/or 

2328

loss of chromosome 22) is mutually exclusive with other gene 
mutations such as AKT1, TRAF7, KLF4 and SMO (19), but not 
with others such as NF1 and NEGR1 (20). In schwannomas, no 
alternative mutation has been found for those samples lacking 
hits over NF2 and, however, Merlin (the NF2 protein) does not 
seem to be present in the cases analyzed to date (21).
The expression analysis of tumor-related genes in menin-
giomas and schwannomas suggests a possible molecular 
subgroup classification in both tumors (22) with the involve-
ment of differential regulatory pathways  (23,24) related 
to the allelic losses at 1p and 14q in meningiomas  (25). 
Whole genome expression analysis has been performed on 
schwannomas (26-28) and meningiomas (29-32). Whereas 
meningiomas have shown differential expression patterns 
based on progression and recurrence, but not strictly supported 
by grade (31), in schwannomas no distinctive pattern has been 
found using clinical correlations (28). However, a critical 
deregulation of microRNAs, including the upregulation of 
those located at the 14q32 chromosomal region, was a charac-
teristic feature of vestibular tumors (33).
Intracranial non-recurrent WHO grade I meningiomas 
and schwannomas represent similar problems for patients, 
depending on the brain structures affected by their non-invasive 
growth. Currently, treatment options for patients with grade I 
meningiomas or schwannomas include surgery resection, 
radio-surgery and a ‘wait and see’ strategy. Thus, there is no 
available chemotherapeutic treatment for these tumors besides 
surgery, a situation especially traumatic for patients suffering 
bilateral vestibular schwannomas and several meningiomas 
such as those affected by NF2. Due to the common genetic 
origin of these tumors (NF2 inactivation), previous studies 
have attempted to identify targets with which to inhibit both 
schwannoma and meningioma progression. AR42, a histone 
deacetylase inhibitor, was found to suppress the proliferation 
of meningioma and schwannoma cell lines in vitro (34), and 
the same effect was shown by cucurbitacin D and goyazen-
solide in primary cultures (35).
In the present study, we used microarray technology 
to compare gene-expression patterns and identify genes 
and pathways of potential interest as key targets for the 
combined treatment of vestibular schwannomas and grade I 
meningiomas.
Materials and methods
Statement of ethics and samples. The local Ethics Review board 
of La Paz university Hospital approved the study protocol 
according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All 
patients received detailed information concerning the study 
and provided their written informed consent prior to their 
inclusion. In this study, we used RNA from 22 meningiomas, 31 
schwannomas and, as non-tumoral controls, 3 healthy menin-
geal tissues, 8 non-tumoral nerves and 1 primary Schwann 
cell culture. The three control non-tumoral meningeal RNAs 
derived from two healthy males and one female and were 
purchased from bioChain® (cat. no. r1234043-10-D03; lot 
nos. B108134, A602330 and B501146).
RNA extraction and microarray experiments. The RNA was 
extracted with the rNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 

USA) as indicated previously (28). For global gene expression, 
the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST was used. The expression 
profile of the meningiomas and the meninges samples can 
be accessed at the gene expression Omnibus (GeO) database 
GSe54934. The arrays of schwannomas and control nerves 
were previously published (28) and are available at the GeO 
database GSe39645. The arrays were processed at the Institute 
for research in Biomedicine (IrB), Barcelona, Spain.
Statistical analysis. The normalization and summarization 
were performed using the robust multichip average (rMA). In 
order to reduce the batch effect among tumors (schwannomas 
and meningiomas) and controls (healthy nerves and meninges), 
a critical aspect for our analysis, we used ComBat (36). For 
data analysis, the genes were considered deregulated between 
groups when at least a 2-fold change in expression and a 
P<0.05 cut-off (ANOVA) was identified, as previously recom-
mended by the MAQC consortium (37). For the comparison 
between schwannomas and meningiomas in order to obtain a 
list of genes with no changes among both tumor types, we used 
a more restrictive fold (<1.5) exclusively for this purpose, since 
the Combat effect could have lowered these values and false-
positives could appear. For comparative purposes, a list of 
differentially expressed genes and fold-change was obtained 
with the Geo2r web tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
geo2r/) in the series GSe43290, which includes 4 meninges as 
controls and 47 tumors (29). As our meningioma series mainly 
included grade I tumors, only the 33 WHO grade I menin-
giomas and the 4 controls included in this report were used for 
comparison.
DNA  extraction.  The  DNA  was  extracted  by  standard 
methods, as previously described (22). The data regarding the 
NF2 status, including loss of heterozygosity of 22q (lOH), 
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MlPA) of 
NF2 (SAlSA P044) and sequence analysis by dHPlC were 
reported previously in detail (22,28), and were performed as 
described (22). Clinical and NF2 status data from the menin-
giomas correspond to cases M02, M04, M05, M07, M09, M10, 
M12, M14, M24, M25, M28, M29, M30, M31, M32, M33, M34, 
M38, M39, M40, M41 and M42, as previously reported (22). 
The complete case series of schwannomas from our previous 
report (28) was included.
Results and Discussion
Comparison with respect to previous analyses of meningiomas 
and the summary of results in schwannomas. Meningioma 
profiling was analyzed extensively in previous studies, and up 
to five expression subgroups were characterized (31), although 
this classification did not represent the actual WHO classifi-
cation. Recurrence and progression appear to play a relevant 
role in the expression pattern of these tumors (32), and two 
meningioma groups were identified showing different clinical 
and pathological behaviors, more related to clinical outcome 
than to WHO grade per se. Furthermore, depending on the 
cytogenetic aberrations, differential expression patterns have 
been described (25,29). Tumors that presented monosomy of 
chromosome 22 and cases with multiple karyotype alterations 
had a differential expression pattern, whereas those cases with 

ONCOLOGY REPORTS  32:  2327-2334,  2014

2329

deletion of chromosome 1 alone showed random behavior (29). 
In summary, previous analyses of gene-expression patterns in 
meningiomas do not seem to accurately represent the current 
WHO classification, although recurrence and progression 
status might be reflected in these studies. We used 20 grade I 
meningiomas, 2 grade II meningiomas and 3 healthy meninges. 
Practically the same values were obtained when meningiomas 
grade II were removed from the study (data not shown). When 
we compared our results in meningiomas with those obtained 
from the dataset GSe43290 (29), we found a high consistency 
in our results, such as the downregulation of diverse genes 
such as SNAP25, MBP, TTR and VSNL1, and the upregulation 
of FBN2, FGF9 and SULF1 (full data available upon request). 
As in previous studies, our 2 cases of meningioma grade II 
did not show a different trend. The schwannoma expression 
profile was previously explained (28). In brief, the upregulation 
of SPP1, MET and associated genes or LATS2 was reported, 
whereas the downregulation of CAV1, AR and PAWR was 
found. In general, myelinization genes were overexpressed, 
suggesting that schwannoma cells could resemble a previous 
state of mature Schwann cells.
Gene  co-overexpression  in  meningiomas  and  schwan-
nomas. Using the ANOVA test at P<0.05 significance across 
the four groups (all meningiomas, schwannomas, control 
healthy meninges and control nerves), we obtained a list of 
12,395 genes with differential expression among these four 
groups. Of those, 346 (data not shown; available upon request) 
did not meet the criteria established for accepting deregulation 
differences between both tumor groups, which was ≤1.5-fold 
of the differential expression between the schwannomas 
and the meningiomas, a limit value selected as deregulated 
between these two groups due to the correction effect of 
ComBat. Among those 346 genes with similar expression in 
tumors, 47 showed co-overexpression in schwannomas and 
meningiomas when compared with their respective controls 
at 2-fold (as ComBat correction would only be based on batch 
effect) (Table I). These genes included e-cadherin (CDH1), 
which  is  usually  silenced  by  several  mechanisms,  such 
as the Wnt signaling pathway in human cancer, including 
meningiomas  (38), and platelet-derived growth factor D 
(PDGFD), an activator for PDGFr-β (39). This pathway has 
been reported as overexpressed in multiple cancer types such 
as pancreatic cancer and brain tumors, including schwan-
nomas (39). Another gene reported as expressed (and protein 
present) in meningiomas and schwannomas is tyrosine kinase 
receptor MET (40), which is responsible for cell migration, 
anchorage-independent growth and many other functions. 
High levels of this receptor have been found in a wide variety 
of tumors, such as breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and head 
and neck tumors (41). Mechanisms such as point mutations, 
alternative splicing, genomic amplification and transcript 
amplification appear to participate in overexpression of c-MET 
(reviewed in ref. 42). Accordingly, we found MET upregula-
tion in both neoplasms compared with their respective control 
tissues, and again, a similar level of expression between both 
tumor types was detected. SLIT2 is a member of the Slit 
family that modulates cell migration by binding with the robo 
family. This gene has been found expressed in the develop-
ment of several malignancies such as colorectal epithelial cell 

carcinogenesis (43). The findings in this report (43), suggest 
that Slit2-robo1 causes e-cadherin degradation, and although 
our results show an upregulation of the E-cadherin gene, the 
former mechanism should not be ruled out in the tumors we 
studied. In other neoplasms, although expressed, SLIT2 does 
not seem to play any role (44). In agreement with the data from 
the study selected for validation (29), several genes, including 
CDH1, PDGFD, CX3CR1, CCND1 and SLIT2, were also 
upregulated, as shown in data obtained from meningioma 
dataset GSe43290 (29); in contrast, MET showed a trend of 
upregulation but did not reach 2-fold. Functional annotation 
using DAVID showed enrichment in inflammatory response, 
cell migration and defense response (data not shown; available 
upon request).
Gene  co-infraexpression  in  meningiomas  and  schwan-
nomas. A total of 35 genes (Table ΙΙ) with no difference in 
expression between schwannomas and meningiomas were 
underexpressed when compared with their respective controls 
in both neoplasms. Among them are selectin e (SELE) and 
rho family GTPase 1 (RND1), which is linked to semapho-
rins (45,46) and cytoskeleton organization in axons. The 
chemokine (C-x-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) was significantly 
downregulated in schwannomas and meningiomas, whereas 
the opposite trend has been shown in malignant neoplasms 
such as ovarian and endometrial cancer and oral squamous 
cell carcinoma (47). As schwannomas and meningiomas are 
usually non-invasive, this fact could explain the different 
trend in deregulation of CXCL2. Stathmin-like 2 (STMN2) 
showed the same pattern: upregulation in hepatoma cells but 
downregulation in schwannomas and meningiomas. Notably, 
STMN2 interacts with rho family GTPase 1 (RND1) in axon 
extension (48), another gene that was downregulated in both 
tumors. Other downregulated genes in both tumors were 
e-selectin (SELE) and vascular adhesion protein 1 (AOC3), 
related to the tethering and rolling of leukocytes (49); thus, the 
non-invasive nature of grade I meningiomas and schwannomas 
could explain the downregulation of these genes. Validation 
with the dataset GSe43290 was performed, and included, 
among others, downregulation of AOC3, STMN2, SELE, 
RGS4, THBS4 and RND1. Functional analysis with DAVID 
included leukocyte and cell migration, heparin binding or 
membrane fraction (data available upon request).
Gene  expression  differences  between  meningiomas  and 
schwannomas. The main goal of our study was to test gene 
expression profiles common to schwannomas and menin-
giomas in regard to their respective controls, and having taken 
into account their relative expression. However, we also studied 
the gene expression differences between both neurogenic 
neoplasms. As samples were processed in various batches, we 
used a Bayesian method to reduce the batch effect. Because 
of this effect, the differential expression of certain genes in 
schwannomas and meningiomas could have decreased. This 
issue, although it limits our information, is vital to our study 
since the batch effect was very marked; 192 genes were 
upregulated at 1.5-fold differences and P<0.05 (data available 
upon request) in schwannomas as compared to meningioma 
expression. Most of these genes are related to neuron migra-
tion and the myelin sheath, such as the following: peripheral

myelin protein 2 (PMP2), expressed in the cytoplasmic side of 
myelin in the peripheral nervous system (50); myelin protein 
zero (MPZ), representing 50% of the total myelin protein in 
the peripheral nervous system (51); neurexin 1 (NRXN1), 
which mediates formation and maintenance of synaptic junc-
tions (52); and neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2), 
which is involved in axonal projection (53).
upregulation in meningiomas compared with schwan-
nomas gave us 88 genes (data available upon request) and 
included cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2), 

a chaperon downregulated in high-grade gliomas (54), and 
secreted frizzled-related protein  2 gene (SFRP2), a gene 
identified as a tumor suppressor in a renal cell carcinoma cell 
line (55).
Another comparison concerned those genes that were 
upregulated in schwannomas with respect to nerves, and 
downregulated  in  meningiomas  with  respect  to  healthy 
meninges. These findings included genes such as hepatocyte 
cell adhesion molecule (HEPACAM), neuritin 1 (NRN1) and 
kinesin family member 1A (KIF1A).

Figure 1. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all samples studied. Green dots represent non-tumoral healthy nerves and the blue dots non-tumoral meninges 
samples. (A) red dots are all the schwannomas studied, while yellow dots are the meningioma samples. Both entities are clearly separated, except for two 
samples (white arrow), one corresponding to a schwannoma from an NF2 patient and the other to a grade I meningioma. The most remote green dot cor-
responds to the cultured Schwann cells used as controls. (B) Violet dots are samples without alteration in the NF2 gene, and gold dots are tumors carrying such 
an alteration. The same point of view is shown in both images A and B, and no clear distinction between those two groups was found.

The  NF2  mutation  rate  (determined  by  sequencing, 
MlPA and chromosome 22q lOH analyses) in this series 
was 74% for schwannomas and 68% for meningiomas. We 
compared the expression patterns in samples from both 
tumor types, and with respect to the presence or lack of any 
alteration in the NF2 gene (38 samples with alteration and 
15 without any). Using these groups, we identified 2 genes 
with differential expression levels. The natriuretic peptide 
receptor C/guanylate cyclase C (atrionatriuretic peptide 
receptor C) (NPR3) was downregulated in those samples 
without NF2 alterations. This gene codes for a receptor 
coupled to various signaling transduction cascades in several 
tissues such as cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (56). On the 
other hand, the G antigen 12J (GAGE12J) gene, transcribed 
in human fetal and tumoral tissues (57), was also downregu-
lated, but on this occasion in tumors with NF2 alteration. As 
only 2 genes were detected, based on our microarray results 
in both neoplasms, it would seem that there is no differenti-
ated subset of expression profiles of genes between samples 
with or without alteration over NF2 in grade I meningiomas 
and schwannomas (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, single genes could 
be altered in tumors with or without NF2 alteration, although 
such a reduced number could be due to outlier values.
At present, there is no chemotherapeutic treatment avail-
able for either meningiomas or schwannomas, thus research 
for a combined solution could be of great value to those 
patients affected with both tumor types, primarily patients 
with neurofibromatosis type 2. In this study, we found a set 
of genes with aberrant expression in both entities compared 
with their respective control tissue, but with similar expression 
levels between these tumors, including PDGF, c-Met or Slit2 
pathways. Thus, these and the other genes identified in this 
study, and their regulatory pathways, might be of interest for 
further experiments in the search for common solutions for 
patients affected by schwannomas and meningiomas.
