Neurofibromin 1–mutant (NF1-mutant) cancers are driven by excessive Ras signaling; however, there are currently no 
effective therapies for these or other Ras-dependent tumors. While combined MEK and mTORC1 suppression causes 
regression of NF1-deficient malignancies in animal models, the potential toxicity of cotargeting these 2 major signaling 
pathways in humans may necessitate the identification of more refined, cancer-specific signaling nodes. Here, we have 
provided evidence that MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs), which converge on the mTORC1 effector eIF4E, are therapeutic 
targets in NF1-deficient malignancies. Specifically, we evaluated primary human NF1-deficient peripheral nervous system 
tumors and found that MNKs are activated in the majority of tumors tested. Genetic and chemical suppression of MNKs 
in NF1-deficient murine tumor models and human cell lines potently cooperated with MEK inhibitors to kill these cancers 
through effects on eIF4E. We also demonstrated that MNK kinases are important and direct targets of cabozantinib. 
Accordingly, coadministration of cabozantinib and MEK inhibitors triggered dramatic regression in an aggressive 
genetically engineered tumor model. The cytotoxicity of this combination required the suppression of MNK-induced 
eIF4E phosphorylation and was not recapitulated by suppressing other cabozantinib targets. Collectively, these studies 
demonstrate that combined MNK and MEK suppression represents a promising therapeutic strategy for these incurable Ras-
driven tumors and highlight the utility of developing selective MNK inhibitors for these and possibly other malignancies.

Introduction
Loss-of-function  mutations  in  the  tumor  suppressor  neurofi-
bromin  1  (NF1)  underlie  the  common  familial  cancer  syndrome 
neurofibromatosis type 1 and promote the development of a vari-
ety  of  sporadic  cancers  including  glioblastoma,  melanoma,  and 
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (1). The NF1 gene encodes 
a  Ras  GTPase–activating  protein  (RasGAP)  (2,  3).  Accordingly, 
excessive Ras signaling underlies the pathogenesis of NF1-mutant 
tumors (4). However, despite this insight, there are currently no 
effective treatments for any NF1-deficient or Ras-driven cancers.
Because NF1-mutant tumors are driven by excessive Ras sig-
naling, we and others have been evaluating Ras pathway inhibitors 
in  a  variety  of  tumor  models  (5–7).  Fortunately,  MEK  inhibitors 
exhibit  efficacy  in  mouse  models  of  clinically  important  benign 
tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, including ner-
vous system lesions known as neurofibromas as well as juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (6, 7), which has inspired the 
development of several clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov). Howev-
er, MEK inhibitors are ineffective the most common malignancy 
associated  with  neurofibromatosis  type  1:  malignant  peripheral 
nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) (8). Approximately 70% of MPNST 
patients present with unresectable and/or metastatic disease, and

conventional chemotherapy and radiation do not improve overall 
survival; therefore, developing a treatment for these tumors repre-
sents a response to an urgent unmet clinical need (9).

In MPNSTs, mTORC1 is the critical PI3K pathway effector, and 
mTORC1 suppression alone exerts cytostatic effects in human cell 
lines and animal models (5, 10). While effects are only cytostatic, 
mTORC1 inhibitors are surprisingly more potent than MEK inhibi-
tors, underscoring the importance of this pathway in this tumor type 
(11).  Moreover,  when  combined  with  MEK  inhibitors,  mTORC1 
inhibitors trigger cell death and dramatic tumor regression in vivo 
(11). Nevertheless, because these 2 major pathways regulate so many 
fundamental biological processes, it may be challenging to identify 
an effective therapeutic window in humans using combined MEK/
mTORC1  inhibitors.  Therefore,  we  have  been  working  to  iden-
tify new therapeutic targets within these pathways that, when sup-
pressed, may selectively affect cancer cells and spare normal tissue.
In the course of the studies presented here, we found that 
eIF4E,  the  limiting  component  of  the  eIF4F  translation  ini-
tiation  complex,  is  a  critical  mTORC1  effector  in  MPNSTs. 
mTORC1 regulates eIF4E by phosphorylating and dissociating 
inhibitory  eIF4E-binding  proteins  (4EBPs);  however,  eIF4E 
function  is  also  controlled  by  phosphorylation  at  serine  209, 
which is exclusively mediated by the MAPK-interacting kinas-
es (MNKs) 1 and 2 (12–14). MNK phosphorylation of eIF4E has 
been shown to enhance the translation of several prooncogenic 
mRNAs, and several mechanisms by which this may occur have

shown that while MNK kinases and eIF4E phosphorylation are 
dispensable  for  normal  development  and  function,  eIF4ES209 
phosphorylation  is  uniquely  enhanced  in  several  cancers  and 
contributes to the development of prostate cancer and lympho-
ma  (15–18).  These  findings  demonstrate  that  the  MNK/eIF4E 
signaling axis plays an important positive role in tumor develop-
ment. Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether the MNK 
kinases are actually therapeutic targets and are required for the 
survival  of  existing  tumors.  We  reasoned  that  MPNSTs  repre-
sent a unique setting for evaluating the therapeutic potential of 
MNK  inhibition,  as  the  MNK/eIF4E  signaling  axis  might  pro-
vide an alternative targetable node in these tumors, obviating 
the need for broad mTORC1 suppression.

Using genetic and chemical approaches, we show that MNK 
kinases  are  important  therapeutic  targets  in  MPNSTs  and  that 
combined MNK and MEK suppression represents a promising new 
therapeutic strategy for treating these currently incurable malig-
nancies. Given that MNK kinases appear to be largely dispensable 
for normal cellular processes, a therapeutic index might be more 
readily achieved using combined MNK and MEK inhibitors. These 
studies also suggest that MNK inhibitors may represent an alter-
native to mTOR inhibitors in some settings.

Results
Combined  eIF4E  and  MEK  suppression  kills  MPNSTs.  We  previ-
ously showed that mTORC1 is critical for the proliferative and 
tumorigenic  properties  of NF1-mutant  MPNSTs  (5,  10).  More-
over, when mTORC1 inhibitors are combined with MEK inhibi-
tors,  human  MPNST  cells  die  and  tumors  regress  in  a  well-
characterized  genetically  engineered  MPNST  model  (Figure 
1A and ref. 11). Because eIF4E has been shown to be a critical 
downstream effector of mTORC1, we investigated whether sup-
pression  of  eIF4E  was  sufficient  to  recapitulate  the  effects  of 
mTORC1 inhibition in this tumor type. Notably, RNAi-mediated 
suppression of eIF4E alone exerted cytostatic effects and inhib-
ited both proliferation and growth in soft agar in human (Figure 
1, B–D) and mouse (Figure 1E) MPNST cell lines, thus mimick-
ing the effects of mTOR inhibitors as single agents (Figure 1A 
and ref. 11). However, when combined with the MEK inhibitor 
PD-0325901  (PD901),  eIF4E  suppression  triggered  cell  death 
(Figure 1, F and G). These results demonstrate that eIF4E is a 
critical  effector  in  NF1-mutant  MPNSTs  and  that  eIF4E  sup-
pression can cooperate with MEK inhibitors and substitute for 
mTORC1 suppression in this therapeutic setting.

The  MNK/eIF4E  signaling  axis  is  activated  in  human  and 
mouse MPNSTs. While mTORC1 activates eIF4E by phosphory-
lating  and  dissociating  inhibitory  4EBP  proteins,  eIF4E  func-
tion is also enhanced by phosphorylation at serine 209, which 
is exclusively regulated by MNK1 and MNK2 (reviewed in ref. 
13). To determine whether MNK/eIF4E signaling was activated 
in MPNSTs, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of eIF4E at 
serine 209 in human and mouse MPNSTs. Immunoblots using 
a phosphospecific antibody demonstrated that eIF4E is hyper-
phosphorylated  at  serine  209  in  human  and  mouse  MPNST 
cells  compared  with  normal  cells  (Figure  2A).  Analysis  of  pri-
mary human and mouse tumor tissue further demonstrated that

eIF4E was phosphorylated in 9 of 10 and 4 of 5 tumors, respec-
tively (Figure 2, B and C). These observations suggest that the 
MNK/eIF4E signaling axis is activated in a high percentage of 
MPNSTs,  warranting  further  investigation  of  the  therapeutic 
potential of targeting this pathway.

Genetic suppression of MNK kinases cooperates with MEK inhibi-
tors to promote MPNST cell death. To evaluate the potential thera-
peutic effects of MNK inhibition, MNK2 and MNK1 were knocked 
down  both  independently  and  in  combination.  Suppression  of 
either MNK2 or MNK1 alone led to a substantial but incomplete 
decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation that was completely lost when 
MNK1 and MNK2 were concomitantly suppressed, indicating that 
both highly related kinases contribute to eIF4E phosphorylation 
in  these  tumors  (Figure  2D).  We  next  examined  the  biological 
consequences of MNK suppression in the presence and absence 
of  MEK  inhibitors.  Genetic  ablation  of  either  MNK1  or  MNK2 
alone slightly inhibited proliferation, but killed cells when com-
bined with PD901 (Figure 2E). Concomitant suppression of MNK1 
and MNK2 further enhanced this cytotoxic response (Figure 2E). 
These results demonstrate that the combined suppression of MNK 
and MEK kinases potently kills MPNSTs, revealing potential ther-
apeutic strategies for these incurable malignancies.

Therapeutic  agents  that  suppress  MNK  kinases  cooperate 
with  MEK  inhibitors.  To  determine  whether  chemical  inhibi-
tion  of  MNK  kinases  could  recapitulate  the  effects  of  genetic 
suppression,  we  first  utilized  the  MNK1  and  MNK2  inhibitor 
CGP57380 (19). Similar to what occurs with genetic ablation of 
MNK1 and MNK2, CGP57380 inhibited eIF4ES209 phosphoryla-
tion in human MPNST cells (Figure 3A) and, on its own, partial-
ly suppressed proliferation (Figure 3B). Moreover, cells treated 
with a combination of CGP57380 and PD901 died (Figure 3B). 
Cercosporamide,  a  natural  product  that  also  inhibits  MNK 
kinases  (20),  also  suppressed  eIF4ES209  phosphorylation  (Fig-
ure  3C)  and  killed  MPNST  cells  in  a  dose-dependent  fashion 
when combined with PD901 (Figure 3D). Because CGP57380 
and  cercosporamide  are  both  tool  compounds  that  are  not 
being clinically developed, we investigated whether any other 
existing  kinase  inhibitors  might  suppress  MNK  and  therefore 
could be more readily evaluated in vivo. Interestingly, the mul-
tikinase  inhibitor  merestinib/LY2801653,  originally  designed 
to suppress the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, has been shown 
to directly inhibit MNK1 and MNK2 kinases (21). Similarly, we 
found  that  the  FDA-approved  compound  cabozantinib,  a  sec-
ond MET/multikinase inhibitor, also directly bound MNK1 and 
MNK2 with a Kd of 790 nM and 21 nM, respectively (Figure 3E), 
and suppressed eIF4ES209 phosphorylation in MPNSTs at even 
lower  concentrations  than  CGP57380  (Figure  3F).  Moreover, 
cabozantinib  exerted  a  dose-dependent  effect  on  eIF4ES209 
phosphorylation  and  MPNST  cell  death  when  combined  with 
PD901 (Figure 3, G and H).

The therapeutic effects of cabozantinib/PD901 require the sup-
pression  of  MNK-induced  eIF4ES209  phosphorylation.  While  these 
studies demonstrate that cabozantinib effectively inhibits MNK 
kinases, it was originally developed as an MET kinase inhibitor 
(22).  Therefore,  to  independently  examine  the  effects  of  MET 
suppression  in  MPNSTs,  we  evaluated  the  effects  of  the  struc-
turally unrelated selective MET kinase inhibitor PF-04217903,

which  did  not  suppress  eIF4E  phosphorylation  (Figure  4A  and 
ref. 23). PF-04217903 effectively suppressed MET phosphoryla-
tion in MPNST cells, but did not significantly affect proliferation 
(Figure 4, A and B). Moreover, combined PF-04217903/PD901 
did  not  trigger  cell  death  or  promote  further  proliferative  sup-
pression compared with PD901 alone (Figure 4B). Other major 
targets of cabozantinib include VEGFR2, AXL, and c-KIT kinas-
es. Immunoblot analysis revealed that c-KIT is not expressed in 
these MPNST cells (data not shown). We therefore investigated 
whether suppression of AXL or VEGFR2 might be mediating the 
observed cytotoxicity. Unlike MNK suppression, which was suf-
ficient to kill MPNST cells in the presence of PD901 (Figure 2E), 

genetic ablation of AXL or VEGFR2 had no effect on the survival 
or  proliferation  of  cells  alone  or  when  combined  with  PD901 
(Figure 4, C and D). Importantly, as observed with MET suppres-
sion, inhibition of these cabozantinib targets also had no effect 
on eIF4E phosphorylation (Figure 4, A and C), indicating cabo-
zantinib-mediated suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation occurs 
solely through direct MNK inhibition as opposed to downregu-
lation  of  upstream  kinases  that  might  converge  on  MNK1  and 
MNK2. Collectively, these genetic and chemical studies demon-
strate that (a) MNK suppression is sufficient to cooperate with 
MEK inhibitors to kill NF1-mutant MPNSTs, (b) several structur-
ally unrelated agents that directly suppress MNK kinase activity

similarly cooperate with MEK inhibitors to kill these tumor cells, 
and  (c)  MET,  AXL,  and  VEGFR2  suppression  are  not  required 
nor sufficient to mediate the cytotoxic effects.

We  initially  began  investigating  MNK  kinases  as  potential 
therapeutic targets in MPNSTs because they uniquely phosphor-

ylate eIF4E at S209 and because eIF4E is such a critical mTOR 
effector in these tumor cells. To confirm that the inhibition of 
eIF4ES209  phosphorylation  was  contributing  to  the  therapeutic 
effects,  we  generated  a  previously  described  phosphomimetic 
mutant in which the serine at position 209 is substituted by an

aspartic  acid  (eIF4ES209D)  (18).  Flag-HA–tagged  eIF4ES209D  and 
WT eIF4E were further engineered with sequential silent muta-
tions  to  prevent  targeting  by  shEIF4E_1  and  were  ectopically 
expressed at physiological levels in MPNST cells together with 
shEIF4E_1  to  suppress  endogenous  eIF4E  expression  (Figure 
4E).  Notably,  the  cells  expressing  eIF4ES209D  were  significant-
ly  less  sensitive  to  cabozantinib/PD901  compared  with  cells 
expressing WT eIF4E (Figure 4, E and F). These observations 
demonstrate  that  the  suppression  of  MNK-dependent  eIF4E 
phosphorylation contributes to MPNST cell death triggered by 
combined cabozantinib/MEK inhibitors. Interestingly, while 9 
of 10 human and 4 of 5 mouse MPNSTs exhibited robust activa-
tion of the MNK/eIF4E signaling axis (Figure 2, B and C), we 
identified  a  human  MPNST  cell  line  that  exhibited  extremely 
low  levels  of  eIF4E  S209  phosphorylation  (Figure  4G).  While 

cabozantinib  effectively  suppressed  MET  phosphorylation  in 
these  cells,  it  had  minimal  effects  on  proliferation  as  a  single 
agent and did not trigger cell death when combined with PD901 
(Figure 4, G and H), consistent with the importance of the MNK/
eIF4E signaling axis in conferring sensitivity.

Combined  cabozantinib/PD901  treatment  promotes  tumor 
regression in vivo. Finally, to test the efficacy of combined MNK 
and MEK inhibition in vivo, we evaluated the effects of cabo-
zantinib and PD901 in a genetically engineered mouse MPNST 
model  (24).  Like  human  MPNSTs,  tumors  from  these  animals 
harbor  compound  mutations  in  Nf1  and  Trp53.  MPNSTs  that 
develop in these animals are highly aggressive, and mice survive 
for an average of 10.7 days after tumors are detected, recapitu-
lating the aggressive nature of human tumors (24). As shown in

ReseaRch aRticleMPNST cells and was potently inhibited in response to cabozan-
tinib. Moreover, combined cabozantinib/PD901 treatment pro-
moted cell death in mouse MPNST lines (Figure 5B). We there-
fore  evaluated  the  therapeutic  effects  of  cabozantinib/PD901 
in vivo. Genetically engineered mice harboring Nf1/p53 mutant 
MPNSTs were treated with cabozantinib at 12.3 mg/kg/d alone 
or  in  combination  with  1.5  mg/kg  PD901  daily.  (Figure  5C). 
Similarly  to  in  vitro  observations,  cabozantinib  alone  exerted 
cytostatic effects; however, when combined with PD901, every 
tumor regressed, shrinking between 36% and 63% (Figure 5C). 
We performed a second preclinical study, extending treatment 
for  21  days,  and  found  that  the  tumor  regression  was  main-
tained,  which  is  particularly  striking  given  that  these  tumors 
grow on average 4- to 7-fold and kill control mice in half of this 
time (Figure 5D). Together with the genetic analysis provided, 
these  findings  suggest  that  combined  MEK/MNK  inhibition 
represents  a  promising  therapeutic  strategy  for  treating  NF1-
mutant  MPNSTs.  While,  cabozantinib  or  other  multikinase 
inhibitors that suppress MNK kinases could be evaluated in this 
therapeutic  context  in  clinical  trials,  more  importantly,  these 
findings support the potential utility of selective MNK inhibitors 
for these and likely other cancers.

Discussion
MPNSTs  are  highly  aggressive  malignancies  that  develop  in 
neurofibromatosis  type  1  patients  or  can  arise  spontaneously 
(8).  These  tumors  frequently  metastasize,  and  there  are  cur-
rently  no  effective  treatments  for  unresectable  lesions,  which 
are lethal in 70% of cases (9). Here, we identify what we believe 
is a new therapeutic target in MPNSTs and provide a promising 
therapeutic strategy for these deadly malignancies. Using a vari-
ety of genetic and chemical approaches, we show that suppres-
sion of MNK kinases effectively cooperates with MEK inhibitors 
to kill human MPNST cells. Moreover, we find that the multiki-
nase inhibitor cabozantinib directly inhibits MNK1 and MNK2 
and cooperates with MEK inhibitors to induce dramatic MPNST 
regression in vivo. Importantly, these therapeutic effects cannot 
be recapitulated by suppressing other cabozantinib targets and 
require  the  suppression  of  MNK-induced  eIF4E  phosphoryla-
tion. Together, these studies highlight the potential therapeutic 
utility of MNK kinase inhibitors in cancer and provide an impor-
tant clinical setting in which they should be evaluated. Notably, 
at least 2 phase I studies of more selective MNK inhibitors are 
currently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov eFT508, BAY 1143269).
Previous  studies  have  shown  that  MNK  is  important  for 
the  development  of  PTEN-mutant  cancers  and  that  loss-of-
function  mutations  delay  tumor  formation  in  mouse  models 
(17). However, not all genes that contribute to tumor develop-
ment  are  therapeutic  targets.  Here,  we  show  that  acute  sup-
pression of MNK plays a causal role in mediating an effective 
therapeutic  response  when  combined  with  MEK  inhibitors. 
Moreover, we find that MNK is an unappreciated direct target 
of  the  FDA-approved  drug  cabozantinib,  suggesting  that  tri-
als evaluating the combined effects of cabozantinib and MEK 
inhibitors should be considered. Notably, while we have found 
that  a  relatively  low  preclinical  dose  of  cabozantinib  is  effec-
tive in this model when combined with a dose of PD901 that 

2 1 8 8

is readily achieved in patients, the potential combined toxicity 
of these agents in humans still needs to be taken into account. 
However, the more important finding in this study is that selec-
tive MNK kinase inhibitors should be effective in NF1-mutant 
tumors,  which  would  circumvent  any  toxicity  associated  with 
inhibiting other cabozantinib targets. Moreover, because MNK 
appears  to  be  a  fairly  cancer-specific  target,  MNK  inhibitors 
may  have  a  unique  therapeutic  window.  The  discovery  that 
MNK  is  the  functional  therapeutic  target  of  cabozantinib  in 
these tumors may be reminiscent of the finding that anaplastic 
lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) is the key target of 
the multikinase inhibitor crizotinib in lung cancer (25). Nota-
bly, the initial ALK/crizotinib discovery led to the development 
of more selective ALK inhibitors that appear to be more effec-
tive than crizotinib and can overcome crizotinib resistance (25). 
The recent emergence of more MNK-selective inhibitors may 
provide a unique opportunity for beginning clinical studies with 
these more specific agents from the onset. Finally, while these 
studies validate MNK as an important new therapeutic target in 
MPNSTs, this combination could also be examined in other Ras 
and/or mTOR-dependent cancers.

eIF4E is a known MNK target, and our phosphomimetic stud-
ies  demonstrate  that  eIF4E  dephosphorylation  is  an  important 
mediator  of  the  therapeutic  response.  However,  MNK  kinases 
have additional known and likely unknown substrates (reviewed 
in ref. 13). Some of these can be conceptually ruled out as contrib-
utors to the therapeutic response, such as Sprouty2, which would 
be expected to be destabilized by MNK inhibition (reviewed in ref. 
13). While it will be interesting to elucidate the complete thera-
peutic effects of MNK suppression, our studies suggest that eIF4E 
phosphorylation at serine 209 can serve as a useful biomarker to 
identify tumors in which MNK kinases are activated. Importantly, 
we find that MNK kinases are activated in a high percentage of 
primary human MPNSTs. A relatively homogenous activation of 
this pathway might be expected in tumors from patients with a 
familial cancer syndrome that overall exhibits less heterogeneity 
than sporadic cancers. However, eIF4E phosphorylation can be 
used to identify other tumor types or tumor subsets that might 
benefit  from  this  therapeutic  approach.  Taken  together,  these 
studies  demonstrate  that  combined  suppression  of  MNK  and 
MEK potently kills MPNSTs and have established a therapeutic 
paradigm for these untreatable malignancies.

(catalog  AF154);  and  Covance:  HA.11  (MMS-101P).  INK128  was 
purchased  from  Active  Biochem.  CGP57380  and  cercosporamide 
were  purchased  from  Tocris  Bioscience.  PF04217903  was  pur-
chased from Selleck Chemicals. Cabozantinib was purchased from 
ChemieTek.  PD901  was  a  gift  from  Kevin  Shannon  (UCSF,  San 
Francisco, California, USA).

Human MPNST samples. All patients were diagnosed as having neu-

rofibromatosis type 1.
RNAi.  pLKO.1 

lentiviral  expression  plasmids  containing  
shRNAs  against  eIF4E  (human  and  mouse)  and  MNK2  were 
obtained  from  the  Broad  RNAi  Consortium.  The  target  sequenc-
es  for  hairpins  directed  against  human  eIF4E  were  as  follows: 
shEIF4E_1 (TRCN0000062574): CCAAAGATAGTGATTGGTTAT; 
and  shEIF4E_2  (TRCN0000299576):  CCGACTACAGAAGAG-
GAGAAA. The target sequences for hairpins directed against mouse 
eIF4E were as follows: shEIF4E_3 (TRCN0000077475): CCGAA-
GATAGTGATTGGTTAT;  and  shEIF4E_4  (TRCN0000077477): 
CGATTGATCTCTAAGTTTGAT. The target sequence for hairpins 
directed  against  human  MNK2  is  shMNK2  (TRCN0000342285): 
CGCCGTCAAGATCATTGAGAA.  Nontargeting,  siMNK1,  siAXL, 
and siKDR pools were purchased from Dharmacon (D-001810-10, 
L-004879-00,  L-003104-00,  and  L-003148-00,  respectively). 
siRNAs  were  transfected  into  cells  using  RNAiMax  lipofectamine 
reagent from Invitrogen.

Soft  agar,  cellular  proliferation,  and  cell  death  studies.  For  soft 
agar experiments, 50,000 S462 cells or 25,000 CM173 cells were 
suspended in 0.35% agar in growth media on top of 0.5% agar in 
growth media in 6-well plates. After 3 weeks, colonies were fixed 
and stained with crystal violet; plates were scanned and the number 
of colonies per well was determined using ImageJ software (NIH). 
For  cellular  proliferation  and  cell  death  assays,  150,000  cells  per 
well were seeded in 6-well plates, and approximately 24 hours after 
plating, day 0 counts were taken. For inhibitor experiments, drug 
treatments were started on day 0, and for siRNA experiments, cells 
were  transfected  approximately  24  hours  before  plating.  All  S462 
cell death assays were performed in DMEM with 2% FBS starting on 
day 0. Final cell counts were taken at 72 or 96 hours where indicated 
to determine changes in cell number from day 0. For Western blots 
to determine drug efficacy or efficient knockdown, lysates were col-
lected 24 hours following the addition of inhibitors.

eIF4E  constructs.  pHA-eIF4E  was  a  gift  from  Dong-Er  Zhang 
(UCSD, La Jolla, California, USA) (Addgene plasmid catalog 17343). 
The  S209D  and  wobble  mutations  were  generated  via  site-directed 
mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Strat-
agene).  WT  and  mutant  cDNAs  were  subsequently  cloned  into  the 
pHAGE-Flag-HA mammalian lentiviral expression vector.

Binding  constant  measurements  and  calculations.  Binding  of  
epitope-tagged MNK1 and MNK2 to immobilized ligand was measured 
as a function of unlinked test compound concentration using meth-
ods  described  previously  (26).  Cabozantinib  dose-response  curves 
were  graphed  using  nonlinear  least-square  fit  with  the  Levenberg- 
Marquardt  algorithm.  Determining  kd  based  on  the  dose  response 
curves used the Hill equation with the Hill slope set to –1.

qPCR. RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy kit. 50 ng of 
total RNA was used for each reaction, and cDNA synthesis and PCR 
amplification  were  performed  using  the  qScript  One-Step  SYBR 
Green  Kit  for  iQ  (Quanta  Biosciences).  Quantitative  PCR  (qPCR) 

reactions were run using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ thermal cycler. Sam-
ples were run in triplicate, and expression levels were determined 
based on a standard curve run with each primer set; levels were nor-
malized to an internal control, GAPDH. The following are the prim-
er  sequences  used:  GAPDH;  for:  5′-CATGTTCGTCATGGGTGT-
GAACCA-3′,  rev:  5′-ATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGT-3′  and 
MKNK2;  for:  5′-AGCCGAACTTCAGGGTTTC-3′,  rev:  5′-AAGT-
CAGAGTCTCCGTGGT-3′.

In  vivo  drug  treatments  and  dosing  schedule.  C57BL/6-Trp53tm1Tyj  
Nf1tm1Tyj  (NPcis)  mice  were  bred  and  maintained  as  previously 
described  (24).  Mice  were  palpated  to  detect  tumors  starting  at  2 
months  of  age,  and  treatment  commenced  when  tumors  reached 
200 to 1,000 mm3. Mice were treated daily with cabozantinib by oral 
gavage at 12.3 mg/kg. Cabozantinib was prepared in 65% D5W/30% 
propylene  glycol/5%  Tween-80  and  was  briefly  vortexed  followed 
by sonication for 2 minutes. PD901 was administered at 1.5 mg/kg 
once  per  day  immediately  prior  to  cabozantinib  administration  by 
oral gavage, and PD901 was prepared as previously described (27). 
To track changes in tumor volume, tumor size was measured at day 
0 and subsequently every 2 to 3 days by vernier calipers; volume was 
calculated using the standard formula L × W2 × 0.52.

Statistics.  For  quantitative  measurements,  graphs  represent 
mean ± SD. Where indicated, data are presented as fold change or 
log2 fold change over initial measurements. Changes in tumor vol-
ume  are  presented  in  a  waterfall  plot  with  each  bar  representing 
the  change  in  tumor  volume  of  an  individual  animal  in  the  study. 
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests, 2-tailed 
unpaired  t  tests,  and  Mann-Whitney  U  tests  was  used  to  compare 
data  sets  where  indicated,  and  P  values  are  shown.  A  P  value  less 
than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Data were graphed 
and analyzed using GraphPad Prism v.6.

Study approval. Animal procedures were approved by the Center 
for Animal and Comparative Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Ani-
mals (National Academies Press. 2011.) and the Animal Welfare Act. 
Consent was obtained for human tissue acquisition according to IRB-
approved protocol (S52563) and local ethical committees.
