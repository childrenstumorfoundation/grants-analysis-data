Background: Fear acquisition and extinction are central constructs in the
cognitive-behavioral model of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which un-
derlies exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth with OCD
may have impairments in fear acquisition and extinction that carry treatment
implications. We examined these processes using a differential conditioning pro-
cedure. Methods: Forty-one youth (19 OCD, 22 community comparisons) com-
pleted a battery of clinical interviews, rating scales, and a differential condi-
tioning task that included habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases. Skin
conductance response (SCR) served as the primary dependent measure. Results:
During habituation, no difference between groups was observed. During acquisi-
tion, differential fear conditioning was observed across participants as evidenced
by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS−; there were no between-group dif-
ferences. Across participants, the number and frequency of OCD symptoms and
anxiety severity was associated with greater reactivity to stimuli during acqui-
sition. During extinction, a three-way interaction and follow-up tests revealed
that youth with OCD showed a different pattern of SCR extinction compared
to the community comparison group. Conclusions: Youth with OCD exhibit
a different pattern of fear extinction relative to community comparisons. This
may be attributed to impaired inhibitory learning and contingency awareness in
extinction. Findings suggest the potential beneﬁt of utilizing inhibitory-learning
principles in CBT for youth with OCD, and/or augmentative retraining inter-
ventions prior to CBT to reduce threat bias and improve contingency detection.

INTRODUCTION

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is character-
ized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions
that affect approximately 1–2% of the population,[1] with
a majority of individuals reporting symptom onset dur-
ing childhood.[2] Youth with OCD experience functional
impairment,[3] and impaired quality of life.[4] Although
multiple factors have been implicated in the etiology
of OCD,[5] the cognitive-behavioral model[6] underlies
the front-line treatment, viz., exposure-based cognitive-
behavioral therapy.[7]

In the cognitive-behavioral model, the mechanisms
of fear acquisition and extinction play an important role
in symptom development, maintenance and treatment
of OCD. Conditioned fear occurs when an emotion-
ally neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) is paired
with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). Although
not a conventional US like a shock, obsessions are pur-
ported to serve as the US in OCD (e.g., fear that a door
handle is contaminated and that contact will cause se-
vere illness/death). Subsequent exposures to the CS be-
come capable of producing a conditioned response (CR)
such as fear/distress. Some individuals with OCD gen-
eralize these learned associations to other stimuli cre-
ating a "chain of contagion."[8] Thus, these individuals
have difﬁculty discriminating between perceived and ac-
tually dangerous stimuli. Extinction is a learning pro-
cess whereby the response to the CS declines through
repeated exposure in the absence of the feared outcome
(e.g., illness/death) and/or engagement in safety behav-
iors (e.g., avoidance, compulsive rituals). This process
does not eradicate the initial CS-US association, but
rather forms a new CS-no US association that inhibits
the existing dysfunctional CS-US association.[9] Over re-
peated exposures to the CS, the original fear/distress re-
sponse (CR) becomes inhibited.[9]

Despite the presumed central role in OCD, limited
empirical data on conditioned fear acquisition and ex-
tinction derive primarily from adults with other anx-
iety disorders.[10–13] Only two studies of adults with
OCD have examined fear learning using Pavlovian
fear conditioning tasks and skin conductance responses
(SCRs).[14, 15] Nanbu and colleagues[14] used a classical
conditioning task, and found no signiﬁcant difference
between adults with OCD and healthy controls. Mean-
while, Milad and colleagues[15] used a differential condi-
tioning task and found no signiﬁcant difference in either
fear acquisition or extinction learning between adults
with OCD and healthy controls. However, Milad and
colleagues[15] did observe impaired extinction recall in
adults with OCD, compared to healthy controls. Despite
methodological differences, ﬁndings collectively suggest
that adults with OCD demonstrate comparable differ-
ential fear conditioning and extinction learning relative
to community comparisons.[14, 15] Age differences have
been found for both differential fear conditioning[16–18]
and the neurobiology underlying fear acquisition and ex-
tinction between youth and adults.[16, 19] Moreover, there

Depression and Anxiety

are considerable phenomenological distinctions between
adults and youth with OCD that limit the generalization
of ﬁndings.[20]

To date, there has been no published examination
of conditioned fear acquisition and extinction in youth
with OCD compared to community comparisons.
Notably, a few studies have compared fear condition-
ing in youth with anxiety disorders and community
comparisons.[21–27] Findings suggest that fear condi-
tioning produces comparable differential fear learning
in anxious and nonanxious youth during acquisition;
however, results for extinction are less deﬁnitive. Some
evidence suggests that anxious youth exhibit resistance
to within-session extinction,[21–23, 25] and/or show larger
CRs to stimuli after extinction.[23, 25, 26] Conversely,
other ﬁndings suggest that
there is no signiﬁcant
difference in extinction,[19, 27] with both anxious and
nonanxious youth exhibiting comparable extinction of
the CR.[24] These inconsistencies may be attributable
to differences in sample characteristics, conditioning
procedures, outcome measures, and unconditioned
stimuli.[19]

Even though a fear conditioning model may not ac-
count for the entire phenomenology of OCD (e.g., not
just right experiences, disgust),[28, 29] understanding fear
conditioning in youth with OCD is clinically relevant.
First, as OCD typically onsets in childhood,[2] examining
fear acquisition and extinction processes closer to symp-
tom onset may help to identify whether impairments
in these processes contribute to OCD phenomenology.
Second, a considerable portion of youth with OCD ex-
hibit inadequate or incomplete response to CBT. In the
Pediatric OCD Treatment Study, up to 25% of youth
did not respond to exposure-based CBT and 60% of
youth remained symptomatic after treatment.[30] Given
the central role that fear conditioning concepts are ac-
corded in CBT, a better understanding of these mecha-
nisms may improve treatment outcome. For example, it
may be that youth with OCD who demonstrate typical
fear acquisition and extinction will beneﬁt from stan-
dard CBT approaches. However, youth who show im-
paired extinction might beneﬁt from augmentative in-
terventions to retrain attention/cognitive/threat biases
before initiating CBT to achieve optimal beneﬁt,[31, 32] or
CBT approaches that emphasize engagement of speciﬁc
brain regions implicated in extinction among youth.[16]
Finally, improved understanding of conditioned fear in
OCD may help to guide future research.

The present study examined fear conditioning and ex-
tinction in youth with OCD and healthy community
comparisons (CC) using a differential conditioning task.
We tested two primary hypotheses. First, we hypoth-
esized that youth with OCD would exhibit poorer ex-
tinction of a fear-conditioned SCR compared to CC.
Second, given prior associations between lower OCD
severity and improved CBT outcomes,[33–35] we hy-
pothesized that greater OCD severity would be associ-
ated with poorer fear extinction. Finally, we examined
the associations between anxiety severity and anxiety

sensitivity to determine whether deﬁcits in extinction
were related to co-occurring anxiety symptoms.

METHODS

PARTICIPANTS

Participants were recruited through a southeastern OCD specialty
clinic and the surrounding community using ﬂyers posted in commu-
nity locations and by word of mouth. Interested participants completed
a phone screen interview with the ﬁrst author to determine possible
eligibility. Inclusion criteria for OCD participants were as follows: a
primary diagnosis of OCD based on a clinical interview, 7–17 years of
age, and English speaking. Exclusion criteria for youth with OCD in-
cluded the presence of autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation,
psychosis, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct dis-
order, or schizophrenia. Psychiatric medication was permissible and no
participant had any medication changes reported within eight weeks
prior to participation. Inclusion criteria for CC included: the absence
of any psychiatric disorder other than speciﬁc phobia as determined
by a clinical interview, 7–17 years of age, and English speaking.

Fifty-seven participants underwent differential fear conditioning.
Seven participants (four OCD, three CC) discontinued the study dur-
ing the acquisition phase, with 50 participants completing the entire
fear conditioning procedure. Several participants’ data were excluded
from analyses due to unreliable recording of SC activity (n = 4) and
small mean SCRs to the US (n = 4). Data from one OCD participant
was excluded due to missing parent and self-report measures. The ﬁ-
nal sample consisted of 41 youth (19 OCD, 22 CC) between 8 and
17 years of age. There were no signiﬁcant differences in demographic
characteristics between the original and ﬁnal sample.

MEASURES

Schizophrenia
for School-Age Children Present

(KSADS-PL). The KSADS-PL is a clinician-administered inter-
view for DSM-IV childhood disorders that has demonstrated excellent
reliability and validity.[36] The rates of OCD, anxiety disorders, and
other comorbid conditions are reported in Table 1.

and

Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-
BOCS). The CY-BOCS is a clinician-administered measure that
is the gold-standard metric of obsessive–compulsive symptom sever-
ity in youth.[37] The CY-BOCS consists of a symptom checklist and
ten severity items that are summed for a total severity score. The CY-
BOCS has demonstrated strong psychometric properties.[37, 38]

Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Child Version (OCI-CV).
The OCI-CV is a 21-item child-report measure that assesses the pres-
ence and frequency of OCD symptoms. Items rated on 3-point scale,
and are summed to yield a total score.[39] The OCI-CV has good re-
liability and validity among youth with OCD.[39, 40]

Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). The
MASC is a 39-item child-report questionnaire that assesses anxiety
severity.[41] Items are rated on a 4-point scale and summed to produce
a total score that is adjusted for age and gender (T-score). The MASC
has good reliability and validity in youth.[41]

Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3). The ASI-3 is an 18-item
patient-rated measure that assessed beliefs about the feared conse-
quences of symptoms associated with anxious arousal.[42] Items are
summed to produce a total anxiety sensitivity score. The ASI-3 has
good reliability and validity.[42]

Fear Conditioning Task. A differential fear conditioning pro-
cedure was administered, whereby a 95 decibel scream and fearful facial
expression (US) was paired with a neutral female face (CS+) but not

with a second neutral female face (CS−). During a habituation phase,
participants passively viewed four presentations each of the to-be CS+
and CS− without the US. The stimulus presentation order was held
constant to minimize procedural variability. During the acquisition
phase, the CS+ female face was paired with the US for eight of ten
presentations; the CS− female face was never paired with the US.
The US duration was 3 s; its onset immediately followed the offset of
the CS+. During the extinction phase, there were eight presentations
each of the CS+ and CS− in the absence of the US. These stimuli and
US have been used in studies of children with anxiety disorders[16, 24]
and healthy comparisons.[17] SCRs served as the primary dependent
measure of fear acquisition and extinction, with larger SCR values
suggesting greater fear.

PROCEDURE

All study procedures were approved by the local institutional re-
view board. After written parental consent and child assent were ob-
tained, parents and youth completed the KSADS-PL to determine
eligibility and the CY-BOCS. Next, youth completed the OCI-CV,
MASC, and ASI-3. Afterward, youth completed the fear conditioning
task. Participants were informed that they could discontinue partici-
pation at anytime. Youth and families were collectively compensated
$30.

DATA ANALYSIS

The SCR score for each CS presentation was calculated by subtract-
ing the average SC level during the 2-s interval immediately preceding
CS onset from the peak SC level during the 8-s CS interval. For the
UCR, a SCR score for each US presentation was calculated by sub-
tracting the average SC level during the last 2 s of the CS interval from
the peak SC level during the 5-s interval following US onset. In order
to address skewness in the SCR distribution, a square-root transfor-
mation was applied to the absolute values of all SCRs prior to analy-
sis. If a SCR was negative, the minus sign was replaced following the
square-root transformation. SCR values were evaluated to determine
potential measurement failure and/or that there was an appropriately
large average response to the US (SCR ࣙ .50 μS). Trial-block scores
were created by calculating the average SCR to successive blocks of
two trials of the same trial type. This produced two blocks each for the
CS+ and CS− for the habituation phase, ﬁve blocks for the acquisition
phase, and four blocks for the extinction phase. Consistent with pre-
vious work,[11, 24] a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was conducted with diagnostic group (OCD, CC) as a between-group
factor, stimulus type (CS+, CS−) as a within-group factor, and trial
block as the repeated measure for each phase. Independent sample
t-tests were used to compare orienting responses (the ﬁrst presen-
tations of the CS+ and CS−) between groups and averaged uncondi-
tioned response to the US across trials. Additionally, the unconditioned
response to the US was compared between groups using a repeated-
measure ANOVA. For all repeated-measure ANOVAs, signiﬁcance
levels reﬂect the Greenhouse–Geisser correction for sphericity. Be-
cause age may inﬂuence fear acquisition and extinction,[18] analyses
were reexamined using only those participants matched for gender and
age within 2 years (n = 38, 19 OCD, 19 CC). There were no substan-
tive differences in ﬁndings, with the noted exception of the three-way
interaction in the extinction phase that reached statistical signiﬁcance
and is reported below. Pearson correlations examined associations be-
tween clinical characteristics and the average SCR for the CS+, CS−,
and their differential score (difference between the CS+ and CS−)
within each phase. Given the preliminary nature of fear condition-
ing analyses among youth with OCD, statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P = .05 for all analyses.[27]

RESULTS

PARTICIPANTS

Comparisons of sample characteristics are presented
in Table 1. Although the groups did not differ in age or
gender, there was a nonsigniﬁcant trend towards fewer
Caucasians among community comparisons. Youth with
OCD were more likely to be taking a serotonin reup-
take inhibitor (SRI) medication compared to community
comparisons (P < .001), with no signiﬁcant difference
found for other psychiatric medication types.

HABITUATION PHASE AND ORIENTING
RESPONSE

There was no signiﬁcant group difference in the SC
orienting response magnitudes, i.e. SCRs to the ﬁrst
CS+ presentation (t39 = .34, P = .74, d = .11) or the
ﬁrst CS− presentation (t39 = .21, P = .84, d = .05).
Table 2 provides
from repeated-measures
ANOVA for the habituation phase. There was a main
effect for trial block that approached signiﬁcance and
reﬂected larger SCRs to the ﬁrst trial block, com-
pared to the second trial block. Additionally, there was
a signiﬁcant stimulus × trial block interaction. This

interaction reﬂects a greater decrease in SCR magnitude
for the CS+ from trial block 1 to trial block 2. Given that
the CS+ was always the ﬁrst stimulus presented, it was
not surprising that there would be a larger initial SCR
and larger subsequent decreases in SCR as participants
habituated to its novelty.

ACQUISITION PHASE

As seen in Table 2, there was a signiﬁcant stimulus
main effect that reﬂected robust differential condition-
ing as indicated by larger SCR to the CS+, compared
to CS−. There was also a signiﬁcant main effect for trial
block suggesting that SCR magnitudes differed across
trials. There was no signiﬁcant group difference between
youth with OCD (M = .53, SD = .26) and the CC group
(M = .42, SD = .19, η2
= .06). There was a signiﬁ-
cant stimulus× trial block interaction reﬂecting differing
SCR magnitudes to the CS+ and CS− in later relative
to earlier trial blocks.
No signiﬁcant difference was found in the average
SCR magnitude to the US between the OCD and CC
groups for CS+ trials paired with the US (t39 = .74,
P = .46, d = .24). Although there was a signiﬁcant main
effect for trial block (F = 6.46, P < .001, η2
= .14), the

EXTINCTION PHASE
As seen in Table 2, there was a signiﬁcant stimulus
main effect, with the CS+ (M = .49, SD = .29) pro-
ducing larger SCRs, compared to the CS− (M = .40,
SD = .25). The group × stimulus × trial block inter-
action approached signiﬁcance; this interaction reached
signiﬁcance when the analysis included only the age-
and-gender matched samples (n = 38; F = 2.72, P = .05,
= .07). When the OCD and CC groups were exam-
η2
P
ined separately, different group patterns emerged (see
Table 3).
For community comparisons, a differential SCR to the
CS+ and CS− was observed throughout extinction as

evidenced by a stimulus main effect. For youth with
OCD, a signiﬁcant stimulus × trial block interaction was
observed suggesting that the differential SCR to CS+
and CS− trials varied across extinction. As can be seen in
Fig. 1, youth with OCD exhibited initially larger SCRs to
the CS− during extinction, which diminished to a com-
parable level to that of the CC group at the end of ex-
tinction. Curiously, youth with OCD exhibited smaller
SCRs to the CS+ during initial extinction trial blocks,
but produced an increasingly large SCR over successive
trials that persisted through the end of the extinction
phase.

CORRELATIONS FOR ACQUISITION,
EXTINCTION, AND DIFFERENTIAL SCR
During acquisition, there was a moderate positive as-
sociation between SCR magnitude to both the CS+ and
CS− with the MASC total score, and a similar associa-
tion observed between the CS+ and OCI-CV total score
(see Table 4). During early extinction, there were mod-
erate negative associations between the differential SCR
and CY-BOCS severity score and ASI-3 score. No other
associations were signiﬁcant.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst examination of dif-
ferential fear conditioning in youth with OCD. Simi-
lar to adult studies, [14, 15] we found that there was no
signiﬁcant difference between youth with OCD and the
CC sample in the acquisition of a fear-conditioned SCR.
Interestingly, youth with OCD did exhibit a different
pattern of SCRs during extinction than that shown by
the CC group. Speciﬁcally, community comparisons re-
tained a differential SCR to the CS+ and CS− through-
out extinction. Although the persistence of a differential
SCR throughout extinction is not always found among
healthy CC participants,[11, 19] it is consistent with self-
report ratings from studies that have used the same con-
ditioning task.[24] In contrast, youth with OCD showed
a reversal of SCRs to the CS+ and CS− during early
extinction followed by increased reactivity to the CS+
and decreased reactivity to the CS− over later extinc-
tion trials. The persistence of differential fear condi-
tioning throughout extinction in both groups suggests
that youth, compared to adults, may have greater dif-
ﬁculty inhibiting conditioned fear. Notably, the abil-
ity to inhibit conditioned fear appeared to be weaker
among youth with OCD as evidenced by their larger
differential SCR in late extinction. Similar to other
fear-based psychopathological conditions such as anx-
iety disorders,[10, 43] this ﬁnding suggests that inhibitory
learning deﬁcits play a central role in extinction for youth
with OCD. Although initial CBT models emphasized
within-and-between session habituation as the central
mechanism for CBT,[44] within- and between-session
habituation in CBT has not been found to predict treat-
ment outcome for youth with OCD.[45, 46] Given the

inhibitory learning impairments noted above, inhibitory
learning may be a key therapeutic component for future
CBT protocols for youth with OCD to improve treat-
ment outcomes.[47, 48]

Along with inhibitory learning impairments in late ex-
tinction, youth with OCD displayed an initial reversal of
SCRs to the CS+ and CS− during early extinction, i.e.
increased reactivity to the CS−. A similar reversal has
been observed in other studies of youth and attributed
to an anticipated reversal of the CS-US contingency in
the absence of a clear threat cue.[18] Youth with OCD
may show a threat-related bias in an ambiguous context
when the association between a CS and US is unclear
and a new threat may be anticipated. It is also possi-
ble that youth with OCD are delayed in their recogni-
tion of a shift in association between the CS+ and US,
which is eventually corrected with further nonreinforced
trial presentations. Given that the ability to correctly de-
tect new associations plays an important role in updating
fear memories during extinction, this impaired recogni-
tion may serve as a harbinger of diminished extinction in

CBT, and/or may reﬂect a biological marker for OCD
symptom persistence into adulthood. Indeed, youth with
fear-based psychopathology who fail to develop more
complex fear learning capabilities (e.g., fear extinction,
discrimination) may have a higher risk of symptom per-
sistence into adulthood.[49]
Across participants, anxiety severity was associated
with larger SCRs to both the CS+ and CS− during the
acquisition phase. Similarly, the number and frequency
of OCD symptoms was associated with larger SCRs to
the CS+. Given their similar magnitude, this provides
empirical support for the relationship between anxiety
and OCD phenomenology with greater reactivity dur-
ing fear conditioning. As there have been inconsistent
ﬁndings regarding fear acquisition differences between
diagnostic groups, this suggests that dimensional factors
may be contributing to fear conditioning across youth.
Additionally, greater OCD severity was associated with
smaller differential SCR scores during early extinction.
A smaller differential SCR suggests that the youth re-
sponded similarly to the fear and safety cues during early

extinction. Although this may be partially attributed to
greater difﬁculty discriminating between feared stimuli
among younger children,[17, 18] it seems more likely at-
tributable to impaired inhibitory learning deﬁcits and
diminished contingency awareness, i.e. the ability to
correctly recognize contingencies. The magnitude of
differential SCR was negatively associated with OCD
severity, one of the few replicated predictors of poor
CBT response,[33, 34] suggesting a possible link between
impaired inhibitory learning, contingency awareness,
and diminished CBT response.
Interestingly, youth with higher anxiety sensitivity
scores also showed poorer discrimination of the CS+
and CS− during early extinction. Anxiety sensitivity is
an important construct in adults with OCD and is associ-
ated with symptoms,[50] severity,[51] and impairment.[52]
Based on these ﬁndings, youth with greater anxiety sen-
sitivity may be more prone to developing learned fear
associations, and/or have difﬁculty distinguishing be-
tween threatening and nonthreatening stimuli due to
anxious arousal. Given that increased anxiety sensitivity
is a consequence of anxious arousal and the current study
elicited anxious arousal via an aversive US, increased anx-
iety sensitivity may serve as a partial explanation for the
reported ﬁndings. Prior associations observed in adults
with OCD[50, 51] and ﬁndings from the current study
suggest that there is likely an overlap between anxi-
ety sensitivity and OCD severity that warrants further
examination.

Several

limitations to the reported work should
be considered. First, although similar to adult OCD
studies,[15] the reported study had a small sample that
included youth on psychotropic medications. Given that
psychotropic medications might be expected to reduce
SCR values,[53] results that trended toward statistical sig-
niﬁcance may emerge as more robust in a larger and/or
unmedicated sample. Second, the signiﬁcance value was
set at P = .05 for all analyses. Although possibly impact-
ing statistical signiﬁcance, this would not have impacted
the magnitude of effect sizes. Third, this study measured
anxiety sensitivity using the ASI-3 to facilitate compa-
rability with prior adult OCD research. Findings may
differ from those that would be obtained using another
anxiety sensitivity measure (e.g., Child Anxiety Sensitiv-
ity Index). Finally, the magnitude of conditioning can
be inﬂuenced by study speciﬁc methodology.[19] Thus,
ﬁndings from the present study may be limited to our
conditioning procedure and sample characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS

Youth with OCD exhibit normal acquisition but
impaired extinction of a fear-conditioned SCR. This
pattern is suggestive of impairments in inhibitory learn-
ing and contingency awareness. Additionally, both anx-
iety severity and OCD symptoms were associated with
greater overall reactivity, but not differential respond-
ing during fear conditioning. Furthermore, both greater
OCD symptom severity and anxiety sensitivity were as-

sociated with poorer discrimination between the CS+
and CS− in early extinction. These ﬁndings highlight
several possible directions for future OCD research.
First, given variable ﬁndings in prior conditioning stud-
ies of youth with anxiety disorders,[27] replication and
extension of these ﬁndings is warranted. In doing so, it
may be useful to capture a trial-by-trial US expectancy
rating to assess youth’s explicit contingency awareness
and recognition of impaired fear extinction. Second, it
would be informative to further examine the role of anx-
iety sensitivity in OCD. Although brieﬂy examined in
adults with OCD[42] and included in the current study,
its investigation in youth and role in treatment is largely
unknown. It may be that greater anxiety sensitivity is as-
sociated with diminished contingency awareness due to
threat anticipation. Third, given the poorer discrimina-
tion of the CS+ and CS− during the contingency shift
in early extinction, the use of attention/cognitive/threat
bias modiﬁcation protocols may be of beneﬁt prior to
CBT in order to improve threat and contingency recog-
nition. Although attention/cognitive/threat bias mod-
iﬁcation protocols have been found to provide some
beneﬁt as stand-alone interventions,[54] they may be of
greater beneﬁt when used to precede and/or augment
CBT.[31, 32] Additionally, there is a growing body of evi-
dence that highlights the importance of inhibitory learn-
ing in exposure therapy.[47] Although predominantly
focused on adults with anxiety disorders,[47] the incorpo-
ration of inhibitory-learning based CBT may prove ben-
eﬁcial in reducing inhibitory deﬁcits and thereby maxi-
mize the therapeutic beneﬁt for youth with OCD.[48]
