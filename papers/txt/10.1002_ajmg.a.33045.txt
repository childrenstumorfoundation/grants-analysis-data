The skeleton is frequently affected in individuals with neuroﬁ-
bromatosis type 1, and some of these bone manifestations can
result in signiﬁcant morbidity. The natural history and patho-
genesis of the skeletal abnormalities of this disorder are poorly
understood and consequently therapeutic options for these
manifestations are currently limited. The Children’s Tumor
Foundation convened an International Neuroﬁbromatosis Type
1 Bone Abnormalities Consortium to address future directions
for clinical trials in skeletal abnormalities associated with this
disorder. This report reviews the clinical skeletal manifestations
and available preclinical mouse models and summarizes key
issues that present barriers to optimal clinical management
of skeletal abnormalities in neuroﬁbromatosis type 1. These
concepts should help advance optimal clinical management of
the skeletal abnormalities in this disease and address major
difﬁculties encountered for the design of clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disor-
der caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the tumor
suppressor neuroﬁbromin [Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al.,
1990; Marchuk et al., 1991]. People with NF1 are constitutionally
heterozygous for an NF1 loss-of-function mutation, that is, they are
haploinsufﬁcient for NF1. The skeleton is frequently affected in
patients with NF1 [Crawford and Schorry, 1999]. Manifestations
include focal bony lesions associated with signiﬁcant morbidity,
mild shortness of stature and reduced bone mineral density (BMD).
The natural history and pathogenesis of NF1 skeletal abnormalities
are poorly understood and currently therapeutic options for these
manifestations are limited.

In February 2008, the Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF)
convened an International NF1 Bone Abnormalities Consortium
to review current approaches to clinical management of NF1
skeletal abnormalities, to discuss available preclinical models of
these disorders, and to identify barriers that might be impeding
progression to future clinical trials for NF1 skeletal abnormalities.
In this research review and report of the Consortium meeting, we
summarize the state of knowledge of NF1 skeletal manifestations,
discuss potential interventions of each, and review mouse models as
the foundation of preclinical trials. This report also highlights
priorities for future research.

INSIGHTS ON NF1 SKELETAL MANIFESTATIONS

The skeletal phenotypes of NF1 can be categorized as either
generalized or focal manifestations. Generalized skeletal manifes-
tations (osteopenia/osteoporosis and shortness of stature) are
common, but usually mild. Focal abnormalities (tibial dysplasia,
short angle scoliosis, and sphenoid wing dysplasia) are less com-

mon, but cause signiﬁcant morbidity. The relationship of general-
ized skeletal manifestations to the occurrence or progression of
focal skeletal abnormalities is unknown, and the overall under-
standing of bone growth, remodeling, and repair in NF1 is critical to
therapy development.

Osteoporosis
Decreased BMD in both sexes at an early age has been
reported in up to 50% of individuals with NF1 [Illes et al., 2001;
Kuorilehto et al., 2004b; Lammert et al., 2005; Dulai et al., 2007;
Stevenson et al., 2007; Yilmaz et al., 2007; Brunetti-Pierri et al.,
2008; Duman et al., 2008]. This may be related to an inadequate
increase in bone remodeling observed by both bone histomorph-
ometry and changes in circulating bone markers [Stevenson et al.,
2008; Seitz et al., 2009]. Despite the consensus that children with
NF1 present with low BMD, interpretation of these studies is
challenging because bone densitometry measures in adult popu-
lations cannot be extrapolated to children, for reasons that include
confounding of DXA results by growth and differences in fracture
epidemiology in children and adolescents [Rauch et al., 2008].
Adding to the complexity of interpreting skeletal changes in the
pediatric NF1 population, the criteria for osteoporosis in children
under age 19 were recently redeﬁned [Lewiecki et al., 2008; Rauch
et al., 2008]. None of the published studies on bone density in NF1
children meet these more stringent new recommendations; few
meet the requirement that the sample size of the control reference
set consider sex, age, and race/ethnicity. In addition, NF1 datasets
are often spread across a large age range with few subjects and based
on T-scores that do not enable comparison to age-adjusted sex-
speciﬁc norms. Therefore, the severity of the osteoporosis in this
pediatric population and its implications are still unclear. An
increased incidence of fractures in patients with NF1 has been
reported, but sample sizes were small [Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2008;
Tucker et al., 2008]. Another challenge to interpreting low BMD in
patients with NF1 correctly is posed by recent reports of low vitamin
D (14–21 ng/ml serum 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D, 25-OH-D) and
osteomalacia in a subset of patients with NF1 [Lammert et al., 2005;
Seitz et al., 2009]. Controlled studies that are adequately powered,
normalize calcium homeostasis and consider age, sex, and race/
ethnicity norms, are needed to determine if the apparent high
prevalence of low BMD in patients with NF1 predicts increased
fracture risk and a need for intervention.

Assessments and interventions. NF1 children and adolescents.
At present, there are no clinical trials to support the use of
osteoporotic drugs in this population, irrespective of whether or
not they exhibit NF1. In the absence of treatment guidelines,
treatment should be conservative and correct measured deﬁciencies
in hormones (vitamin D, thyroid, estrogen, etc.) that are known to
regulate skeletal growth and maturation. A review of bone mass and
bone size during skeletal growth concluded changes were depen-
dent on calcium intake and exercise, especially in prepubertal
children [Heaney and Weaver, 2005]. Conservative therapy to
promote bone health such as treatment with calcium, vitamin D,
and weight-bearing exercise therefore forms the ﬁrst line of therapy
in children with NF1 and low bone mass.

Conservative therapy is no longer adequate once fractures have
occurred. Non-pharmacologic therapies that use skeletal loading
via physical therapy [Chad et al., 1999] or standing on vibration
platforms [Ward et al., 2004] have not been tested in subjects with
NF1. Osteoporosis drugs are either anabolic or anti-resorptive.
Anabolic drugs are limited to two forms of parathyroid hormone
and are contraindicated in children because of the increased
incidence of osteosarcoma in rats [Tashjian and Gagel, 2006].
Anti-resorptive drugs such as the bisphosphonates and antibodies
that target osteoclasts have been used to reduce osteoporotic
fractures in adults, but their effect on BMD and fracture risk in
children with NF1 is unknown.

NF1 adults. At this time, treatment of osteoporosis in adults
with NF1 should not differ from that of people who do not exhibit
NF1, until further information is obtained. Because low serum
25-OH-D and osteomalacia has been reported in patients with NF1
and low bone mass, patients should be evaluated for vitamin
supplementation. The recent change in reference standards for
serum 25-OH-D from 10 ng/ml, considered the ‘‘rachitic’’ value for
many years, to 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) [Wagner and Greer, 2008;
Mimouni and Shamir, 2009], has implications on the need for
intervention and effective dosing. A study using 1,000 IU vitamin D
to correct serum levels in four patients with NF1 reported increased
BMD [Seitz et al., 2009], while a lower dose of 400 IU in another
study did not improve BMD [Bruenetti-Pierri et al., 2008]. Sample
size in both studies is too small for deﬁnitive conclusions on
effective dose. Standard of care requires osteoporotic adults over
age 50 years to take 1,200 mg calcium and 800–1,000 IU vitamin D
per day, and to reduce clinical risk factors by regular weight bearing
and muscle strengthening exercises and avoidance of smoking and
excessive alcohol. Selection of approved anabolic or anti-resorptive
drugs to prevent or treat osteoporotic fractures should follow the
standard practice. Clinical trials are needed to determine which of
currently available therapies are most effective to treat patients with
NF1 and osteoporosis.

Short Stature and Macrocephaly
Individuals with NF1 tend to be shorter than expected for their
families [Szudek et al., 2000; Virdis et al., 2003], with 20–30% of
adults with NF1 estimated to have a height below the 3rd centile.
Growth velocity in these individuals is typically normal or near
normal before puberty, then declines. Short stature in patients with
NF1 is usually proportional. Scoliosis, growth hormone deﬁciency,
and other NF1-related complications can contribute to short
stature, but the cause of short stature in most patients with NF1
is unknown.

Head circumference in patients with NF1 tends to be large, and
macrocephaly (head circumference >2 SD above the mean) occurs
in about one-fourth of patients [Szudek et al., 2000]. However,
much of this is thought to be due to enlargement of the brain
[Greenwood et al., 2005]. It is not clear if skull growth contributes to
macrocephaly.

Dysplasia of the Tibia and Other Long Bones
Long bone dysplasia is seen in a small percentage (3–4%)
[Friedman and Birch, 1997] of patients with NF1 and most com-
monly involves the tibia, although other long bones can be affected.
Affected individuals usually present in infancy with unilateral
anterolateral bowing of the lower leg (Fig. 1a), although a child
may be born with fracture and/or pseudarthrosis, or develop these
shortly after birth (Fig. 1b,c). The anterolateral bowing seen in
patients with NF1 is distinct from the bilateral physiological bowing
common in children as they begin to walk. Radiographically, tibial
bowing in NFL patients prior to fracture usually appears as cortical
thickening and medullary canal narrowing at the apex of the
convexity, typically near the junction of the middle and distal
thirds of the tibia [Stevenson et al., 2007] (Fig. 2). Various radio-
graphic classiﬁcation systems for tibia bowing have been proposed
[Hardinge, 1972; Andersen, 1973; Bassett et al., 1981; Boyd, 1982;
Crawford, 1986; Crawford and Bagamery, 1986; Crawford and

Assessments and interventions. The current standard for treat-
ment of long bone bowing in children is bracing to prevent fracture
[Bara et al., 2007; Oﬂuoglu et al., 2008]. Although evaluations of
brace type, duration of use, or long-term beneﬁts have not been
published, the majority of members of this Consortium advocated
early bracing until the child achieves maturity. However, in some
cases bracing should continue into adulthood [Crawford and
Schorry, 2006]. The Consortium orthopedists recommended rou-
tine bracing of the dysplastic long bone upon diagnosis of bowing
and agreed that prophylactic surgery should be avoided.

Treatment for long bone pseudarthrosis is often unsatisfactory,
requiring multiple surgeries or ultimately amputation [Coleman
and Coleman, 1994; Stevenson et al., 1999; Traub et al., 1999;
Wientroub and Grill, 2000]. The Consortium members thought
that bracing after fracture should continue, delaying surgery until
mid-childhood (5–8 years of age). Complications of long bone
pseudarthrosis include residual angular deformity, ankle stiffness,
limb length discrepancy, refracture, and chronic pain. Most sur-
geons resect the pseudarthrotic region and perform bone bridging
and ﬁxation via intramedullary stabilization devices, free vascular-
ized ﬁbular grafting (contralateral or ipsilateral), or external ﬁxa-
tion (e.g., Ilizarov technique), either alone or in combination with
transankle ﬁxation [Johnson et al., 1990; Friedlaender et al., 2001;
Vander Have et al., 2008]. Attempts have been made to promote
bone healing with electrical stimulation, varying periods of post-
operative immobilization, supplemental bone grafting, and appli-
cation of bone morphogenetic proteins and stem cells [Johnson
et al., 1990; Friedlaender et al., 2001; Kitoh et al., 2004; Vander Have
et al., 2008].

Several series of surgical outcomes have been reported [von
Satzger and Herbst, 1981; Murray and Lovell, 1982; Anderson
et al., 1992; Coleman and Coleman, 1994; Gilbert and Brockman,
1995; Traub et al., 1999; Grill et al., 2000; Romanus et al., 2000;
Tudisco et al., 2000; Wientroub and Grill, 2000; Dobbs et al., 2004;

the apex of the bowing with narrowing of the medullary canals.

changes over time.

The bowed long bone frequently sustains fracture (Fig. 3) usually
before age 3 years, often with minimal trauma, leading to subse-
quent non-union or ‘‘pseudarthrosis.’’ Histologically, the ﬁbrous
pseudarthrosis tissue seen at the fracture site is not a neuroﬁbroma;
rather it is a ﬁbrous overgrowth of unspeciﬁed cell origin.

Ohnishi et al., 2005; Bara et al., 2007]; however, the number of
patients is usually small and there is no consensus regarding the
treatment for pseudarthrosis. Comparison of studies is difﬁcult
because of limited follow up, age differences, lack of designation of
NF1, severity of the dysplasia, number of surgeries, and use of
ancillary treatments.

Overall, tibial dysplasia with pseudarthrosis is a challenging NF1
skeletal manifestation. Our knowledge of its natural history and
pathogenesis is limited, and there is a lack of consensus regarding
therapeutic approaches. The Consortium participants agreed that
clinical trials should assess the outcome of continued bracing after
fracture in comparison to early surgery, or the effects of pharma-
cologic augmentation at the time of surgery on time to healing and
potential re-fracture. More data from preclinical drug trials are
needed to guide selection of therapeutic agents and drug delivery
methods. It is likely a combination of pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic approaches will be advantageous to provide optimal
fracture healing in dysplastic tibiae.

Vertebral Defects
Ten to 33% of children with NF1 have vertebral deformity and 2%
of children with scoliosis have NF1 [Vitale et al., 2002]. Two types
of spinal curvature occur in NF1: dystrophic and non-dystrophic
(Fig. 4a,b). The term dystrophic has been utilized in the orthopedic
literature to describe a dysplastic type of scoliosis with a rapid
course of progression [Durrani et al., 2000]. Although no diagnostic
criteria for dystrophic scoliosis exist, Durrani et al. [2000] described
nine speciﬁc radiographic features associated with dystrophic
scoliosis (rib penciling, vertebral rotation, posterior vertebral scal-
loping, anterior vertebral wedging, lateral vertebral scalloping,
vertebral wedging in either the sagittal or coronal plane, spindling
of the transverse process, widened interpedicular distance, and
enlarged intervertebral foramina). Non-dystrophic scoliosis is
more common [Vitale et al., 2002] and resembles idiopathic
adolescent scoliosis in the NF1-unaffected population. In rare
instances, non-dystrophic scoliosis can progress to the dystrophic
form. Dystrophic scoliosis usually presents in the preadolescent

child with sharp angulation over a short segment of the spine. It is
potentially debilitating and may rapidly progress to neurological
impairment. Distinctive radiographic features of dystrophic scoli-
osis include a short-segment sharply angulated curve (involving
four to six vertebrae), scalloping of vertebral margins, vertebral
wedging, spinal canal widening, defective pedicles, and rib-pencil-
ing [Crawford et al., 2007].

Dystrophic scoliosis is frequently associated with paraspinal or
other internal neuroﬁbromas adjacent to the vertebrae [Khong
et al., 2003; Ramachandran et al., 2004]. Tumors have been
observed via MRI in 69% of patients with NF1 and dystrophic
scoliosis (E. Schorry and A. Crawford, unpublished results) with a
higher incidence in those with short-segment sharp curves versus
non-dystrophic curves (77% vs. 24%). Alwan et al. [2005] hypoth-
esized that vertebral bone in NF1 responds differently to the
presence of a paraspinal tumor; however, there are no prospective
data regarding the relationship of paraspinal neuroﬁbromas to
dystrophic scoliosis. If the adjacent neuroﬁbromas were to con-
tribute to the development and progression of dystrophic scoliosis,
then therapies to reduce or stabilize the tumors could provide a
promising approach to scoliosis prevention. It would be useful to
collect data on vertebral abnormalities and scoliosis in patients
enrolled in clinical trials for the treatment of plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas. These data should include plain radiographs of the spine
to assess degree of curvature, vertebral scalloping, vertebral wedg-
ing, defective pedicles, rib-penciling, and progression of these
features; biochemical markers of bone resorption; and lumbar
BMD.

Dural ectasia, deﬁned as widening of the dural sac surrounding
the spinal cord, can occur in patients with NF1 and dystrophic
scoliosis (Fig. 4d) [Schonauer et al., 2000; Tubbs and Oakes, 2002;
Khong et al., 2003]. It is not known if this is a primary malformation
or secondary to the vertebral abnormalities. Dural ectasia may be a
primary mesodermal dysplasia of the meninges [Casselman and
Mandell, 1979] or an expansion of dural tissue into new space
created by vertebral body bone loss. The vertebral column can
dislocate or erode, causing rib dislocation into the spinal canal,
resulting in spinal cord injury. Kyphoscoliosis is another NF1

quent development of scoliosis, then pharmacologic agents to
increase vertebral strength may be appropriate.

There is no effective treatment for NF1-related dural ectasia and
investigation of the natural history, frequency, and pathophysiolo-
gy is needed.

Chest Wall Deformities
Chest wall deformities in patients with NF1 are incompletely
understood but thought to be present in as many as 50% of patients
[Riccardi, 1999] (Fig. 5). The relationship of chest wall deformities
to scoliosis in patients with NF1 is not clear. The chest wall
deformities are principally cosmetic; surgical treatment is rarely
required.

Sphenoid Wing Dysplasia
Cranial defects in patients with NF1 usually involve the sphenoid
wing (Fig. 6). In a cohort of 256 probands with NF1, 11% had a
dysplastic sphenoid wing [Friedman and Birch, 1997]. Most cranial
defects are associated with plexiform neuroﬁbromas [Jacquemin
et al., 2002, 2003], often with inﬁltration and decalciﬁcation of
cranial bones adjacent to tumors. Other lesions associated with
sphenoid wing defects include arachnoid cysts, dural ectasia, or
buphthalmos. Sphenoid wing dysplasia is thought to be a secondary
response of bone to the adjacent soft tissue abnormality. However,
two observations suggest the existence of a bone cell-autonomous
defect and may help elucidate the etiology of the dysplastic sphe-
noid wing: NF1 sphenoid wing lesions have been associated with
tibial and vertebral dysplasia [Alwan et al., 2007], and formation of
this skull structure proceeds through endochondral bone forma-
tion, which is defective in NF1 [Kolanczyk et al., 2007]. As a

skeletal abnormality, in which vertebral bodies may be so severely
deformed as to resemble malformations. Weakening of spinal
stabilizers (i.e., facets, pedicles, and ligaments), perhaps by dural
ectasia with meningocele formation, may lead to kyphosis.
Assessments and interventions.
If a child is skeletally immature
and the spine curvature measures 25–45, bracing is typically
used, while surgery is commonly employed if the curvature pro-
gresses to >45 before maturity or 55 after maturity (Fig. 4c).
Skeletally immature patients with dystrophic scoliosis with a cur-
vature >30 typically require a unique management approach due
to progression. Imaging should look carefully for paravertebral
tumors and dystrophic changes that may be missed on plain
radiographs. Presurgical characterization is critical as the lamina
may be thin, the canal affected by dural ectasia or intraspinal
tumors, and a rib may have displaced into the spinal canal, all of
which have an increased risk of poor post-surgical outcome.

Surgical treatment with fusion and growing rods is complex.
Variables such as age, gender, associated neuroﬁbromas, location
and degree of the curve, and associated radiographic dystrophic
features make trial design difﬁcult. Poor understanding of the
natural history of dystrophic scoliosis and a lack of animal
models additionally hinder progress. We do not yet understand
the pathogenesis of NF1 dystrophic scoliosis and there are no clear
pharmacologic adjunctive options. If effective therapy for neuro-
ﬁbromas is found, secondary effects may improve dystrophic
scoliosis. The occurrence of vertebral pseudarthrosis after surgery
[Kim and Weinstein, 1997] suggests intrinsic abnormalities of the
vertebral bony matrix in NF1. If focal decreases in BMD of speciﬁc
vertebrae cause microfractures and vertebral wedging with subse-

congenital malformation, or as a secondary bony defect sphenoid
wing dysplasia is not a primary target for therapeutic prevention. It
may be more promising to ﬁrst apply sensitive imaging techniques
to screen patients with sphenoid wing dysplasia for adjacent
tumors, which may be amenable to therapy.

Other Skeletal Manifestations of NF1
Other rarer bone abnormalities are observed in patients with NF1.
Cystic osseous lesions, often identiﬁed incidentally during radio-
graphic knee exam, are occasionally seen in the absence of tumors or
long bone dysplasia [Colby and Saul, 2003; Lee and Cho, 2006]. The
lesions rarely fracture or show progressive deformity, and biopsy
generally shows non-ossifying ﬁbromas. Dental abnormalities,
including increased caries and early primary tooth eruption, and
periapical cemental dysplasia have been reported in patients with
NF1 [Lammert et al., 2007; Tucker et al., 2007; Visnapuu et al.,
2007]. Periapical cemental dysplasia may be confused with chronic
inﬂammation on radiographic analysis and precipitate unnecessary
dental procedures. More information regarding NF1 dental abnor-
malities is needed.

MOUSE MODELS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NF1

Difﬁculties in understanding the human pathophysiology of NF1
skeletal defects led to the development of mouse models to deter-
mine the role of Nf1 in bone cells and facilitate preclinical studies.
Nf1 mRNA and neuroﬁbromin are expressed in mouse bone and
cartilage during development and adulthood [Kuorilehto et al.,
2004a], and more speciﬁcally in mesenchymal stem cells, chon-
drocytes, osteoblasts [Elefteriou et al., 2006; Kolanczyk et al., 2007],
and osteoclasts [Yang et al., 2006a]. This pattern of expression
suggested that NF1-related skeletal defects stem in part from
primary osseous defects caused by bone cellular dysfunctions
related to generalized NF1 heterozygosity, and/or to NF1 loss of
function in speciﬁc bone cell types.

The early embryonic lethality of Nf1

embryos precluded
skeletal analyses [Brannan et al., 1994; Jacks et al., 1994; Lakkis
þ/ 
and Epstein, 1998] and the ﬁrst NF1 mouse bone study used Nf1
mice. Nf1
osteoprogenitors and osteoblasts had defects in
proliferation and differentiation in vitro and constitutive activation
of Ras and Erk signaling, as observed in Nf1
Schwann cells [Yu
et al., 2005]. Nf1 haploinsufﬁciency affected the monocytic lineage
as well, based on the observation that Nf1
osteoclast precursors
undergo faster differentiation than wild-type (WT) counterparts
in vitro, due to activation of a Ras-AKT-PI3K pathway.

mice,
which suggests that NF1 heterozygosity alone is insufﬁcient to
explain tibial or vertebral dysplasia in NF1 patients; this is sup-
ported by the low incidence and focal nature of bony dysplasias
among these patients. An attractive theory is somatic inactivation of
the normal NF1 allele in a ﬁnite set of cells from the affected tissues.
This is supported by the demonstration of double inactivation of

[Elefteriou et al., 2006; Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2008; Seitz et al., 2009]

(Fig. 7). The bones of Nf 1
ob mice also exhibited increased
osteoclast numbers and bone resorption similar to humans with
NF1 [Stevenson et al., 2008]. These in vivo studies indicated that
neuroﬁbromin in osteoblasts inhibits collagen synthesis, promotes
mineralization, and also regulates osteoclastogenesis by limiting the
expression of receptor activator for nuclear factor k B ligand
(RANKL), the major osteoblast-derived cytokine promoting the
formation of mature osteoclasts. Constitutive activation of Ras,
Erk, Rsk2, and the transcription factor ATF4 was identiﬁed as major
regulator of increased collagen synthesis and osteoclastogenesis in
response to Nf1 deﬁciency [Elefteriou et al., 2006] (Fig. 8).

Another mouse model, the Nf1Prx / 

model, deleted both alleles
of Nf1 in mesenchymal cells and their derivatives (osteoblasts,
adipocytes, chondrocytes, muscle cells, and endothelial cells of the
skullcap and developing limb bud mesenchyme). These mice had
growth retardation and grossly
stunted limbs
[Kolanczyk et al., 2007], including bowing of the tibia similar to
that seen in NF1 patients. Increased porosity and decreased calcium
content was proposed as the cause of bowing. The Nf1Prx / 
mouse
is characterized by delayed osteoblast differentiation, which was not

advanced our understanding of Nf1 functions in bone cells, more
sophisticated models and methods are needed, not only to trigger
Nf1 loss-of-function in speciﬁc bone cell types, but also to affect
speciﬁc skeletal elements at various developmental stages.

Despite these limitations, Nf1-deﬁcient mice are highly valuable
in preclinical testing of candidate therapies for NF1 skeletal defects.
Initial preclinical studies using these mice reported delayed bone
healing in Nf1
mice upon distal tibia fracture [Schindeler et al.,
2008a]. While Nf1
mice do not replicate the bowing and
spontaneous fractures seen in patients with NF1 and tibial dyspla-
sia, they indicate that Nf1 haploinsufﬁciency is sufﬁcient to model
defective NF1 bone repair. This result also suggests that fracture
healing might be impaired in non-dysplastic bones in patients with
NF1. The cell types and molecular mediators that contribute to
poor Nf1

healing remain to be fully characterized.

þ/ 

Various studies have been initiated in preclinical mouse models
to assess the potential efﬁcacy of selected drugs on bone formation,
repair and remodeling. A recent study demonstrated that the
combination of bisphosphonates and bone morphogenetic protein
2 (BMP2, a protein which induces bone and cartilage formation)
improved net bone production by Nf1
cells in an in vivo model
of heterotopic bone formation [Schindeler et al., 2008b]. This
treatment did not attempt to correct the speciﬁc signaling defects
associated with Nf1
osteoblasts, but represented an initial
approach. Bisphosphonates are currently approved for other ap-
plications, so they could transition rapidly to NF1 clinical trials.
Kolanczyk et al. [2008] recently reported that the drug lovastatin
improves cortical bone injury healing defects observed in the
Nf1Prx / 

mice.

SUMMARY

Following the meeting, the NF1 Bone Consortium committed to
establishing a clinical and research network to collaborate in the
development of preclinical studies and clinical trials in order to
identify effective management strategies and therapeutic ap-
proaches for NF1 skeletal abnormalities. Key issues from this
literature review and discussion from the multidisciplinary NF1
Bone Consortium meeting were identiﬁed.

The key issues that present barriers to optimal clinical manage-

ment of NF1 skeletal abnormalities are the following:

(1) NF1 is a multifaceted, polysystemic disease. A number of
skeletal abnormalities are highly morbid with a natural history
distinct from that of the general population. Some manifes-
tations, such as dystrophic scoliosis, can lead to clinically
signiﬁcant consequences if neglected.

(2) Consensus guidelines for the treatment of the speciﬁc ortho-
pedic manifestations in patients with NF1 do not exist and
clinical management practices for each NF1 skeletal abnormal-
ity are highly variable.

(3) Limited knowledge is available about the pathophysiology of
NF1 skeletal abnormalities. This presents considerable limi-
tations in determining how to approach the design and con-
duct of clinical trials for NF1 skeletal abnormalities. A better
understanding of the natural history and the development of
new therapies and long-term orthopedic management will be
essential to improve patient care.

limited data from preclinical studies,

(4) The cost of clinical trials, limited available funding for orphan
disorder trials, lack of animal models recapitulating the skeletal
phenotypes,
lack of
availability of candidate therapeutic interventions with few
side effects, potential poor patient compliance with protocols
due to co-morbidities and lack of and difﬁculty in identifying
available outcome measures and endpoints were identiﬁed as
current barriers to successful skeletal abnormalities clinical
trials in patients with NF1.

The following concepts will direct future research plans to help

(2) In patients with NF1, ﬁndings such as low BMD and short
stature reﬂect a generalized alteration of bone. The rela-
tionship of this generalized skeletal condition to the develop-
ment
skeletal
abnormalities like tibial dysplasia and dystrophic scoliosis is
not clear.

and progression of

focal

(3) Prospective studies to determine the relationship of spinal
neuroﬁbromas in patients with dystrophic scoliosis are needed
to determine if early treatment of spinal neuroﬁbromas could
prevent dystrophic scoliosis. It will be beneﬁcial to collect data
on bone and scoliosis in clinical trials treating neuroﬁbromas.
(4) Available mouse models recapitulate some, but not all, of
the bone abnormalities
in patients with NF1. Mouse
data helped clarify that NF1 haploinsufﬁciency is likely related
to the generalized NF1 bone remodeling defects, whereas
total
loss of NF1 function is likely related to the focal
(dysplastic) defects. Identifying neuroﬁbromin cellular func-
tions,
target genes and downstream signaling pathways
remains a priority to understand the etiology of the NF1
skeletal manifestations.

(5) Ras/Erk constitutive activation occurs in Nf1-deﬁcient osteo-
blasts (as in Schwann cells), and inhibition of Ras/Erk signaling
by lovastatin in an NF1 mouse model improves bone healing
defects.

(1) In patients with NF1, the morbidity associated with either
dystrophic scoliosis or tibial dysplasia is much greater than that
of short stature or macrocephaly. This helps deﬁne priorities
for future trials.

The following are examples of feasible areas to start the devel-
opment of NF1 skeletal abnormalities clinical trials based on our
current understanding of bone disease in NF1:

(1) The prevention of fracture during initial presentation of
long bone bowing would likely improve quality of
life.
Therefore, trials investigating early and prolonged bracing
to prevent fracture in patients with long bone bowing,
including trials utilizing different types of braces, would be
beneﬁcial.

(2) Anecdotally, early surgical

intervention in children with
NF1 and tibial pseudarthrosis results in poorer outcomes
compared to later surgical intervention. Bracing for tibial
dysplasia after fracture may be a preferred strategy to
delay surgery and optimize the chance of positive outcomes.
Bracing studies after fracture are of high priority (e.g., early
surgery vs. bracing and later surgery). Agreement on the
standardization of bracing protocols among surgeons will be
difﬁcult, but is required for future trials focused on tibial
dysplasia.

þ/ 

(3) Some patients with NF1 have decreased BMD, and defects in
vitamin D metabolism, osteoclastogenesis or bone cell re-
sponse to systemic signals regulating bone remodeling are
likely involved. However, an increased incidence of fractures
has not yet been ﬁrmly established. Based on human data and
healing defects observed in Nf1
mice, studies investigating
fractures are needed in individuals with NF1 to determine
whether fracture healing defects are observed in dysplastic
bones only or generally in the NF1 skeleton. Currently, except
for adult cases with unequivocal osteoporosis, the consensus
among NF1 Bone Consortium participants was not to inter-
vene for mild to moderate decreases in BMD. A clinical trial of
the efﬁcacy of standard treatment for osteoporosis in adults
with NF1 with documented osteoporosis is recommended.

(4) Use of locally applied biological mediators (e.g., bone mor-
phogenetic protein) at the time of surgery in patients with
pseudarthrosis is an attractive option in order to avoid com-
plications of systemic administration of pharmacologic agents.
Based on data from the animal models, a variety of cell types
and signaling pathways are likely to be involved in NF1 patients
with bone manifestations. Therefore, combination therapies,
using both anabolic and anti-catabolic medications, will likely
give optimal results.
