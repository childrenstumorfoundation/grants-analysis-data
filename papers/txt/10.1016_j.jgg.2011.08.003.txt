Abstract

Recurrent genomic imbalances at 16p11.2 are genetic risk factors of variable penetrance for developmental delay and autism. Recently,
16p11.2 (chr16:29.5 Mbe30.1 Mb) deletion has also been detected in individuals with early-onset severe obesity. The penetrance of 16p11.2
deletion as a genetic risk factor for obesity is unknown. We evaluated the growth and body mass characteristics of 28 individuals with 16p11.2
(chr16:29.5 Mbe30.1 Mb) deletion originally ascertained for their developmental disorders by reviewing their medical records. We found that
nine individuals could be classiﬁed as obese and six as overweight. These individuals generally had early feeding and growth difﬁculties, and
started to gain excessive weight around 5e6 years of age. Thirteen out of the 18 deletion carriers aged 5 years and older (72%) were overweight
or obese, whereas only two of 10 deletion carriers (20%) younger than ﬁve were overweight or obese. Males exhibited more severe obesity than
females. Thus, the obesity phenotype of 16p11.2 deletion carriers is of juvenile onset, exhibited an age- and gender-dependent penetrance.
16p11.2 deletion appears to predispose individuals to juvenile onset obesity and in this case are similar to the well-described PradereWilli
syndrome (PWS). Early detection of this deletion will provide opportunity to prevent obesity.

1. Introduction

Whole genome proﬁling technologies

such as array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) have enabled the
accelerated discovery of novel genomic imbalances (deletions
and microduplications)
in patients with speciﬁc clinical
phenotypes. These novel genomic disorders often exhibit
additional clinical features beyond those for which they were
initially ascertained. A reverse genomic or “genotype-ﬁrst”

approach (Ledbetter, 2008), where individuals with the same
or similar genomic imbalances are further evaluated, is not
only necessary to determine the penetrance and spectrum of
clinical features associated with a genomic disorder but also
important to effectively discover additional comorbid features
critical for patient management and genetic counseling.

Deletion at 16p11.2 (chr16:29.5 Mbe30.1 Mb) is a recur-
rent event mediated by segmental duplication architecture, and
is common among patients with developmental delay (DD),
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neuropsychiatric
problems (Sebat et al., 2007; Christian et al., 2008; Kumar
et al., 2008; Marshall et al., 2008; Weiss et al., 2008). The
clinical phenotypes of individuals carrying the deletion are
heterogeneous (Bijlsma et al., 2009; Fernandez et al., 2010;
Hanson et al., 2010; Rosenfeld et al., 2010; Shinawi et al.,
2010). The phenotypes associated with this deletion show

incomplete and variable penetrance since the deletion has also
been observed in control population (Kumar et al., 2008;
Weiss et al., 2008; Bijlsma et al., 2009; Glessner et al.,
2009; Rosenfeld et al., 2010) and in patients without autism
spectrum disorder ( Ghebranious et al., 2007; Bijlsma et al.,
2009; Shimojima et al., 2009; Shiow et al., 2009; Fernandez
et al., 2010; Hanson et al., 2010; Rosenfeld et al., 2010;
Shinawi et al., 2010).

Overweight (deﬁned as sex speciﬁc Body Mass Index (BMI)-
for-age 85the95th percentile) and obesity (deﬁned as sex
speciﬁc BMI-for-age 95th percentile) have been observed in
individuals carrying 16p11.2 deletion (Ghebranious et al., 2007;
Bijlsma et al., 2009; Fernandez et al., 2010; Shinawi et al., 2010;
Bochukova et al., 2010; Walters et al., 2010). To evaluate the
penetrance of obesity and overweight among individuals with
16p11.2 deletion, we took a genotype-ﬁrst approach. We
examined the growth characteristics and related clinical features
of individuals carrying 16p11.2 deletion detected by diagnostic
chromosome microarray analysis in a hospital setting. Our
results showed that obesity is a common clinical feature of
16p11.2 deletion patients, and exhibits age-dependent pene-
trance suggesting that earlier diagnosis may allow for more
effective intervention.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Patient population

Individuals with 16p11.2 deletion were identiﬁed from
all patients referred for diagnostic aCGH and subsequently de-
identiﬁed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board for Human Subjects Research at the Children’s Hospital
Boston, USA.

2.2. aCGH analysis

aCGH was performed using Agilent 244K oligonucleotide-
based CGH array (G4411B, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,
CA, USA) following previously published protocols (Shen
et al., 2007) and the manufacturer’s instructions (Oligonucle-
otide Array-Based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis protocol
version 3 (Agilent Technologies)). The aCGH data was
managed using Nexus software (V5, BioDiscovery, Inc. El
Segundo, CA, USA).

2.3. Medical record review and literature data review

All available electronic medical records of the patients [mean
age ¼ 8y8m (8 years and 8 months); age range ¼ 1y10me21y]
with 16p11.2 deletion were reviewed by a working group that
consisted of a pediatric clinical geneticist, laboratory molecular
geneticist, and pediatric nutrition/weight specialist. Consensus
clinical features were tabulated and anthropometric data were
collected to calculate the BMI percentile and Z-score (standard
deviation), based on the 2000 Center for Disease Control (CDC)
Growth Charts for the United States. In addition, 387 individuals

(mean age¼ 12.9y; age range¼ 5ye22y) with DD/ASD without
16p11.2 deletion were randomly chosen as controls.
We also reviewed literature reports of 47 patients (mean
age ¼ 8y, age range ¼ 2me44y) with 16p11.2 deletion
(Kumar et al., 2008; Bijlsma et al., 2009; Shimojima et al.,
2009; Fernandez et al., 2010; Rosenfeld et al., 2010;
Shinawi et al., 2010) for information on gender and weight-
for-age percentile (Supplementary Table 1). The weight-for-
age percentiles are plotted against age.

3. Results

We identiﬁed 28 patients (15 male, 13 female) with
16p11.2 deletion out of the 6680 consecutive clinical referred
diagnostic cases subjected to aCGH analysis. The most
common clinical indications for array testing were DD and
intellectual disability (ID)(n ¼ 3638, 54.5%), ASD (n ¼ 2200,
32.9%) and dysmorphism or multiple congenital anomalies
(n ¼ 1412, 21%). Eighteen percent had more than two indi-
cations for testing. Thirteen deletions were de novo and 4
deletions (2 paternal and 2 maternal) were inherited from one
of the parents. Data on parental BMI are not available.
Complete parental testing was not performed for the remain-
ing cases (n ¼ 11) (Table 1).

3.1. Growth and development related clinical features of
patients with 16p11.2 deletion

We reviewed the medical records mainly from Genetics,
Neurology, Developmental Medicine (n ¼ 28) and Nutrition
Clinic visits (n ¼ 3). Relevant clinical features are summa-
rized in Table 1.

Pregnancy and delivery were generally uncomplicated. Six
individuals weighted less than 2500 g, three of those were part
of twin pregnancies. Four weighted more than 4000 g at birth;
thirteen were born at appropriate weight for gestational age,
and ﬁve had no birth weight recorded.

DD or ID was a common feature of 16p11.2 deletion
patients. Fifteen of the 21 individuals who had formal cogni-
tive testing were found to have ID, with a severity ranging
from severe to borderline, and with the majority being mild.
Ten patients also had the clinical diagnosis of ASD. Hypotonia
was present in 17 of the 22 patients whose examination of
muscle tone was mentioned in the medical records. Early
feeding difﬁculty and failure to thrive were common (10 out of
22 with clinical notes describing feeding difﬁculties).

3.2. Overweight and obesity is an age- and gender-
dependant feature

We found that overweight or obesity was frequent among
patients with 16p11.2 deletion. At their most recent exam, six
out of 28 were overweight and nine were obese, together
comprising more than half (15/28) of the cases. The youngest
individual was w2 years of age, but overall
overweight
overweight or obesity is much more prevalent
in older
patients. Thirteen out of 18 deletion patients aged ﬁve years

and older (72%) are overweight or obese whereas only two of
the 10 patients younger than 5 years (20%) are overweight or
obese. The age of onset was speciﬁcally noted in 5 patients (#3
at 6 y; #6 at 3 y; #2 and #7 at 4 y and #11 at earlier than 6 y).
Thus, overweight or obesity associated with 16p11.2 is of
juvenile onset and is of age-dependent penetrance (Fig. 1).

Obesity was observed in both males and females at about
similar rate (w50%), but
the severity of obesity differs
signiﬁcantly between male patients and female patients. In this
cohort, 5 male patients are obese with the mean Z-score ¼ 2.6,
four female patients are obese with the mean Z-score ¼ 1.97,
making the extent of obesity signiﬁcantly more severe in male
patients than in female patients (t-test, P ¼ 0.03).

The penetrance of obesity among patients with 16p11.2
than 5 years (mean age ¼ 11.7 y, age
deletion older
range ¼ 5 ye21 y) is 47% (8/17), and is signiﬁcantly higher
test, P ¼ 0.039)
(Fisher’s exact
than that of DD/ASD
patients of similar age range without 16p11.2 deletion (20.9%
(81/387)), suggesting that
the high penetrance of obesity
among patients with 16p11.2 deletion is not due to a comorbid
clinical diagnosis of DD or ASD.

To determine whether these ﬁndings might reﬂect some bias
in our patient cohort, we also performed a literature review. As
shown in Fig. 2, we observed similar age-dependent penetrance
of obesity in patients with 16p11.2 deletion using weight-for-
age percentile data: 18 of 28 individuals older than 5 years
(64.3%) were overweight or obese, whereas only 2 of 22 indi-
viduals younger than 5 years (9.1%) were overweight or obese.
Furthermore, the penetrance of overweight or obesity is higher
in male (14/19 ¼ 73.7%) than in female (4/9 ¼ 44.4%) indi-
viduals with 16p11.2 deletion.

Regarding the causes of overweight or obesity among
patients with 16p11.2 deletion, avid appetite was noted in 5

patients (#2, 3, 16, 18 and 22). Four other patients (#7, 9, 10
and 23) were noted as picky eaters with a very limited and
rigid diet. Another patient (#8) exhibited ravenous eating
behavior (this patient was not overweight or obese at 2 years
of age). Excessive appetite, limited repertoire of food choices,
and low level of physical activity seem to be collectively
involved in the excessive weight gain of patients with 16p11.2
deletion.

4. Discussion

While recent forward genetic studies indicated 16p11.2
deletion as a signiﬁcant genetic risk factor for severe obesity
(Bochukova et al., 2010; Walters et al., 2010), our reverse
genetic study revealed that overweight and obesity is an age-
and gender-dependent clinical phenotype among patients with
16p11.2 deletion. This ﬁnding further supports the notion that
genomic imbalances can play important roles in the patho-
genesis of childhood obesity, both severe and moderate. This
newly discovered genomic disorder, combined with the classic
human obesity syndrome, the PradereWilli syndrome (PWS),
illustrated an increasingly important genetic mechanism where
dosage change of one or more genes in a contiguous genomic
set can lead to the disruption of molecular pathways involved
in body mass regulation. We found that the prevalence of
obesity in older children exceeds 70%, which is similar to the
level of other clinical features consistently associated with
16p11.2 deletion, such as developmental delay/intellectual
disability (Fernandez et al., 2010; Rosenfeld et al., 2010;
Shinawi et al., 2010). It is possible that our study does not
represent the true penetrance of obesity because of ascertain-
ment bias toward individuals with 16p11.2 deletion and ASD
or other developmental disability. Ten out of 28 patients with

Y. Yu et al. / Journal of Genetics and Genomics 38 (2011) 403e409

the 16p11.2 deletion in this cohort were clinically diagnosed
with ASD. This raised the concern that the overweight or
obese phenotype could be a secondary comorbid feature of
ASD. The BMI characteristics of patients with ASD are
controversial in the literature: several studies found the asso-
ciation of high BMI with ASD while some other studies came
to the opposite conclusion (Bo¨lte et al., 2002; Mouridsen et al.,
2002; Whiteley et al., 2004; Curtin et al., 2005; Mills et al.,
2007; Mouridsen et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2009). Differ-
ences in ASD diagnostic criteria, ASD patient subgroup (e.g.,
Asperger syndrome vs. Autism), age group, sample size,
gender, ethnicity and study period may all contribute to the
contradictory ﬁndings. A recent study by Chen et al. (2010)
using the BMI data collected by the National Survey of
Children’s Health (NSCH-2003) found that among several
chronic conditions, ASD patients (247 patients aged 10ye17y)
exhibited the highest prevalence of obesity (23.3%), double
the rate of the control population without any chronic condi-
tion (12.2%). The prevalence of obesity in our cohort of
16p11.2 deletion patients aged over 5 years is 47% (8/17), four
times the normal control prevalence rate and double that in
unselected ASD patients. Although ASD could be a con-
founding factor for the obesity observed in 16p11.2 deletion
patients, it does not seem to be the main causal factor for the
obesity phenotype. Importantly, recent genomic studies in
patients ascertained by BMI independently identiﬁed the
16p11.2 deletion as a signiﬁcant genetic risk factor for obesity
(Bochukova et al., 2010; Walters et al., 2010). Thus, the
overall evidence supports the notion that both obesity and
ASD are major clinical phenotypes of patients with 16p11.2
deletion. In the context of an energy imbalance model of
obesity, 16p11.2 deletion patients exhibited both increased
energy input (increased food intake and anabolic level) and
reduced energy expenditure (reduced physical activity and
catabolic level), which could explain the excessive weight
gain. However, the mechanism by which 16p11.2 deletion
leads to overeating behaviors and low energy expenditure need
further
recent obesity GWAS
studies have provided strong evidence for neuronal involve-
ment in the pathogenesis of obesity (Willer et al., 2009),
suggesting that both ASD and obesity may share similar
underlying molecular and pathological mechanisms. This is an
interesting hypothesis and deserves further examination.
16p11.2 deletion may serve as an ideal model for under-
standing the common pathways that contribute to both ASD
and obesity.

investigation.

Intriguingly,

Some similar clinical features were noted in comparing
16p11.2 deletion disorder and PWS. Notably several of our
patients were suspected to have PWS during their clinical
diagnostic visits. Shared features between the two disorders
include early feeding difﬁculty and poor weight gain, followed
by excessive eating and early childhood obesity. Motor and
language problems as well as cognitive delay are common in
both two disorders, as are autistic features and other neuro-
psychiatric disturbances. However, important differences that
can be helpful for differential diagnosis do exist. In patients
with PWS, early poor weight gain is often a direct

consequence of poor sucking ability, usually caused by severe
hypotonia. In patients with 16p11.2 deletion, hypotonia was
often mild and sometimes only affected the extremities. The
feeding difﬁculty that existed in several 16p11.2 deletion
patients was mainly due to poor coordination between
sucking, swallowing and gastroesophageal reﬂux.

In contrast to PWS, hypogonadism, short stature and ﬂex-
ible ligaments are not evident in individuals with 16p11.2
deletion. No characteristic facial feature has been evident with
16p11.2 deletion disorder. PWS patients tend to have smaller
head size (Butler and Meaney, 1991), while patients with
16p11.2 deletion are often macrocephalic (Shinawi et al.,
In our cohort, 15/19 individuals are of >90%
2010).
occipital-frontal circumference (Table 1). These differences
are helpful for the differential diagnosis of the two disorders.
A thorough comparison of the clinical features of the two
disorders is warranted using larger patient cohort.

Obesity and its complications have myriad adverse effects
on the health and disease prognosis of an individual. The
discovery of the high risk of obesity in patients with 16p11.2
deletion will have signiﬁcant direct clinical implications for
patient care and management. Currently, body mass control is
not a routine clinical care component for patients with 16p11.2
deletion. Among 28 deletion patients, only 3 individuals were
followed in a pediatric nutrition/weight program. Since most of
these patients are young, the long term consequences of obesity
among these patients are currently unknown. Longitudinal
follow-up studies will be necessary in order to understand the
trajectory of body mass gain associated with 16p11.2 deletion
and the effectiveness of body mass management schemes.
