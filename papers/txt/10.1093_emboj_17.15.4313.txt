Neuroﬁbromin is the product of the NF1 gene, whose
alteration is responsible for the pathogenesis of neuro-
ﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequent
genetic disorders in man. It acts as a GTPase activating
protein (GAP) on Ras; based on homology to p120GAP,
a segment spanning 250–400 aa and termed GAP-
related domain (NF1GRD; 25–40 kDa) has been shown
to be responsible for GAP activity and represents the
only functionally deﬁned segment of neuroﬁbromin.
Missense mutations found in NF1 patients map to
NF1GRD, underscoring its importance for patho-
genesis. X-ray crystallographic analysis of a proteo-
lytically treated catalytic
fragment of NF1GRD
comprising residues 1198–1530 (NF1-333) of human
neuroﬁbromin reveals NF1GRD as a helical protein
that resembles the corresponding fragment derived
from p120GAP (GAP-334). A central domain (NF1c)
containing all residues conserved among RasGAPs is
coupled to an extra domain (NF1ex), which despite
very limited sequence homology is surprisingly similar
to the corresponding part of GAP-334. Numerous point
mutations found in NF1 patients or derived from
genetic screening protocols can be analysed on the
basis of the three-dimensional structural model, which
also allows identiﬁcation of the site where structural
changes in a differentially spliced isoform are to be
expected. Based on the structure of
the complex
between Ras and GAP-334 described earlier, a model
of the NF1GRD–Ras complex is proposed which is
used to discuss the strikingly different properties of the
Ras–p120GAP and Ras–neuroﬁbromin interactions.

Introduction
Neuroﬁbromatosis
Recklinghausen neuroﬁbromatosis,

type 1 (NF1), also termed von
is a common auto-

somal dominant disease affecting ~1 in 3500 individuals
(Riccardi, 1981, 1991; Riccardi and Eichner, 1986). Mul-
tiple so-called ‘cafe´ au lait’ spots, Lish nodules of the
iris, and neuroﬁbromas, benign cutaneous tumours, are
hallmarks of the disease with important diagnostic relev-
ance. While several manifestations are benign in character
some of them involve a signiﬁcant risk of developing
malignant or fatal traits, such as plexiform lesions or optic
glioma (Gutmann and Collins, 1993). Therefore, NF1 has
been grouped together with familial cancer syndromes
(Bader, 1986).

The NF1 gene has been identiﬁed to code for a large
transcript that is disrupted or mutated in patients affected
with NF1 (Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al., 1990;
Wallace et al., 1990). Since the gene appeared to be
inactivated in tumours it has been postulated to act as a
tumour suppressor (Ponder, 1990; Stanbridge, 1990). In
spite of conﬂicting genetic results, experimental evidence
accumulated during the past few years indicate that loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) precedes ﬁbrosarcomas and other
lesions, with a somatic mutation following an inherited
mutant allele (Serra et al., 1997).

NF1 codes for a protein comprising 2818 amino acids
(Marchuk et al., 1991) termed neuroﬁbromin (~280 kDa)
that is found in the particulate fraction bound to a very
large protein (DeClue et al., 1991). Analysis of the
predicted protein sequence revealed homology between a
segment spanning 250 amino acids with high and an
additional 150 amino acids with lower homology to Ras-
speciﬁc GTPase activating proteins (Xu et al., 1990a)
such as p120GAP (Trahey and McCormick, 1987) and its
yeast homologues IRA1 and IRA2 (Tanaka et al., 1990a,b,
1991). Biochemical analyses and functional comple-
mentation tests in yeast established this segment as a
functional GAP-related domain (NF1GRD) that is able to
stimulate GTP-hydrolysis on normal but not oncogenic
Ras (Ballester et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Xu et al.,
1990b), thus linking neuroﬁbromatosis to the regulation
of the Ras–MAP kinase pathway and its activation by
oncogenes (Lowy and Willumsen, 1993). It has indeed
been found that Ras is mostly in the GTP-bound form in
cell lines established from malignant
tumours without
functional neuroﬁbromin (Basu et al., 1992; DeClue et al.,
1992; Guha et al., 1996), suggesting that neuroﬁbromin
is a major regulator of Ras in the parental cells due to
its GAP activity. Further studies indicate that another
mechanism of NF1-mediated tumour suppression is pos-
sibly independent of its GAP activity (Nakafuku et al.,
1993; Johnson et al., 1994; Griesser et al., 1995). Four
differentially spliced isoforms have been detected so far
(Gutmann et al., 1995), one of which, the type II transcript,
is characterized by a 21 amino acids insertion within the
GAP-related domain (GRD; Nishi et al., 1991; Suzuki
et al., 1991; Andersen et al., 1993). Somatic mutations in

NF1 have been shown to map to the GRD and affect the
interaction with Ras (Li et al., 1992; Purandare et al.,
1994; Upadhyaya et al., 1997; Klose et al., 1998), under-
scoring the importance of this part of the protein for
proper neuroﬁbromin function. Neuroﬁbromin has been
shown to associate with microtubules (Gregory et al.,
1993) thus linking its function to aspects of structural
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. It binds tubulin and
the binding region presumably overlaps with NF1GRD
since tubulin inhibits GAP activity (Bollag et al., 1993).
The fundamental physiological importance of neuroﬁb-
romin is underscored by the observation that mice with
a targeted disruption of the neuroﬁbromin locus are
embryonically lethal and show abnormalities of neural
crest-derived tissues (Brannan et al., 1994; Jacks et al.,
1994).

We have previously determined the structure of GAP-
334 (Scheffzek et al., 1996), the NF1GRD homologue in
p120GAP, and of its complex with Ras (Scheffzek et al.,
1997). Together with biochemical analyses (Mittal et al.,
1996; Ahmadian et al., 1997b) this enabled us to character-
ize the Ras–RasGAP interaction and to elucidate the
mechanism of GTPase activation. In order to address the
speciﬁc issues underlying neuroﬁbromin function, we
report here the crystal structure of NF1GRD, determined
from a proteolytically treated fragment comprising
residues 1198–1530 (NF1-333). Signiﬁcant but limited
homology with GAP-334 suggested structural similarity
but also differences that might account for the strikingly
different biochemical behaviour of the two proteins: (i) on
a structural level, the minimal domain with full catalytic
activity obtainable by limited proteolysis or recombinant
expression is 270 residues for p120GAP, compared with
230 for neuroﬁbromin (Ahmadian et al., 1996). (ii) For
neuroﬁbromin, a fragment of 91 residues has been deﬁned
to retain some catalytic activity and yet does not contain
residues thought to be critical for catalysis, and an even
smaller fragment with anti-oncogenic activity from the
C-terminus of the catalytic fragment has been reported
(Nur-E-Kamal et al., 1993; Fridman et al., 1994). The
putative catalytic activity of these fragments could not be
reconciled with the structure of GAP-334 or of its complex
with Ras, raising the possibility of signiﬁcant deviations
in the NF1GRD–Ras interaction pattern. (iii) The afﬁnity
of neuroﬁbromin for Ras-GTP is 50- to 100-fold higher
than that of p120GAP, and the kinetics of association and
dissociation are much faster for the latter (Eccleston et al.,
1993; Ahmadian et al., 1997a). (iv) Although the catalytic
activity of both GAPs is generally sensitive to the presence
of detergents, speciﬁc inhibition of neuroﬁbromin can be
obtained by applying selective compounds such as dodecyl
maltoside (Bollag and McCormick, 1991).

On the basis of our structural model we analyse these
features together with mutations found in NF1 patients or
derived from mutational studies. In addition, we discuss
aspects of NF1–tubulin interaction and, on the basis
of the Ras–RasGAP complex, propose a Ras–NF1GRD
complex model that should be an approximation of the
transition state of the GTPase reaction.

Results and discussion
Structuredeterminationandmodelquality
The structure was determined by X-ray crystallographic
analysis of crystals obtained from proteolytically treated

4314

NF1-333 (described in Materials and methods). Since
attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement
using the coordinates of GAP-334 (protein data bank
accession code 1WER) as a search model were not
successful, we used the Multiple Isomorphous Replace-
ment (MIR) method. Using mercury and platinum deriva-
tives we obtained a heavy atom model suitable for initial
phase determination with a data set of 2.5 Å resolution,
collected from six untreated crystals on the synchrotron
beam line X11 at EMBL (c/o DESY; Hamburg, Germany),
as native reference (Table I; Materials and methods). The
initial electron density map (Figure 1A) was readily
interpretable and could accommodate a Cα-model corres-
ponding to the central domain (GAPc) of GAP-334
(Scheffzek et al., 1996), which served as a guide during
subsequent model building and reﬁnement. Remaining
density within the asymmetric unit could be explained
in part by N-terminal extension of this model up to residue
1206. Two further helices turned out to represent segments
derived from the C-terminal region of NF1-333 (Figure
1A). Analysis of dissolved crystals or of the protein
solution used for crystallization by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis revealed two major components to be
present in the crystals. N-terminal sequencing along with
mass spectroscopy suggested that protease treatment of
NF1-333 had nicked the polypeptide chain close to the
position of Ser1474. The structural
integrity of NF1-
333 appears to remain basically unaffected by protease
digestion. The observed crystal packing is consistent
with an NF1GRD protein cleaved in the segment con-
taining the proteinase K cleavage site, and would not be
compatible with uncleaved NF1-333 in the asymmetric
unit.

A high degree of mobility appears to be characteristic
of the NF1-333 in our crystals with extensive regions
remaining without well deﬁned electron density. In suc-
cessive rounds of interactive model building (program
‘O’; Jones et al., 1991 and reﬁnement (program X-PLOR;
Bruenger, 1991), residues showing sufﬁcient electron
density were incorporated into the model, that presently
contains 260 residues of NF1-333 deﬁning regions 1206–
1304, 1331–1403, 1412–1463, 1485–1503 and 1514–1530,
with interspacing segments predominantly ill-deﬁned in
the electron density map. In the present model, ~30
residues were built as alanine or glycine because of unclear
side-chain density. A segment of the ﬁnal 2Fo–Fc map is
shown in Figure 1B. Reﬁnement statistics and model
quality are summarized in Table II, including those for
the GAP-334 model which had not been completed at the
time of its publication (Scheffzek et al., 1996). The current
R-factor is 27% (Rfree ⫽ 37%), which is comparatively
high and at least in part reﬂects residual electron density
that could not be explained in terms of ordered polypeptide
chains. For the following reasons we are very conﬁdent
that the current NF1GRD model is largely correct: (i) we
used the MIR method for structure determination, thus
our initial phases are unbiased by the GAP model that
only served as a guide for model building; (ii) coordinates
of heavy atom sites are consistent with the mercury
compound binding to cysteines; (iii) a loop which by
sequence comparison contains three amino acids less than
the corresponding stretch in GAP-334 is correspondingly
shorter in NF1-333 (Figure 1C; see below). Thus, together

with the results of structure reﬁnement, several lines of
evidence indicate that our structure determination presents
a valid model of NF1GRD, suitable for analysis of various
mutations associated with NF1 and with the structure of
the Ras–GAP-334 complex at hand to discuss effects on
the interaction with Ras.

Overallstructure
The purely helical protein is similar in structure to GAP-
334 with a central domain (NF1c; segments 1253–1304,
1331–1403 and 1412–1463) containing the conserved
residues and an extra domain (NF1ex) that comprises
segments 1206–1252, 1485–1503 and 1514–1530 (Figure
2A and C). For graphic representation and clarity the
regions missing from our NF1GRD model were comple-
mented by the corresponding segments of the GAP-334
model where they are mostly well-deﬁned. The two
structures superimpose (Figure 2B) with an r.m.s.d. value
of 1.83 Å when comparing the positions of 243 correspond-
ing Cα-atoms using program ‘O’ (Jones et al., 1991). The
largest differences are seen in the extra domain where
helix α1ex appears to be shifted by ~3 Å in comparison
with the corresponding helix in GAPex. The central domain
coincides with a minimal catalytic fragment of neuro-
ﬁbromin with full GAP activity, which was originally
obtained by proteolysis and can be expressed as a recom-
binant fusion protein and cleaved (Ahmadian et al., 1996).
Interestingly, the corresponding fragment of p120GAP
could not be expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble
protein. This suggests that despite close similarities in the
primary sequence, subtle differences exist in the interaction
patterns between the extra and the central domain in these
two GAPs, and might inﬂuence ﬂexibility and/or exposure
of hydrophobic residues. With regard to the absence of
sequence homology within the extra domains of GAP-

that

334 and NF1GRD, and to the fact
they are not
involved in the interaction with Ras-GTP, their structures
are surprisingly similar. This suggests a conserved function
for this part of the proteins, possibly serving structural
‘assistance’ for the central catalytic GAP modules. A
detailed analysis of this issue will have to await
the
structure determination of other RasGAPs, which show
no or very limited sequence homology outside the central
catalytic domain (Figure 2C).

Regions of high mobility predominantly include seg-
ments connecting helices as indicated in Figure 2A and
B. As extrapolated from the GAP-334 model, an extended
chain linking the C-terminal end of NF1c to NF1ex contains
the proteinase K cleavage site; since the corresponding
region is ﬂexible in GAP-334 as well, it is unlikely that
this is due to cleavage in NF1-333: rather, ﬂexibility
makes this region more accessible to the protease. It is
possible that the extensive mobility which is also reﬂected
in the high Wilson B-factor (~50 Å2) provides an explan-
ation why poor diffraction quality is common in most of
our previously obtained crystals containing fragments of
NF1GRD.

TheRas-bindinggroove
Given the similarity of GAP-334 and NF1-333, we use
corresponding structural annotations and can identify the
Ras-binding site as the groove in the surface of NF1c,
which is bordered mainly by the ﬁnger loop (L1c) along
with part of helix α2c and by the variable loop (L6c;
Figure 2A and C) (Scheffzek et al., 1997). Helix α6c is
less distorted than in GAPc with only Phe1392, next to
the FLR-ﬁnger print motif of RasGAPs, interrupting the
ideal helix geometry. Various hydrophobic and polar
residues cover the ﬂoor of the groove, comprising con-
served/invariant residues and amino acids that are different

from their GAP-334 counterparts. The most prominent
deviation is seen in position 1419 where a lysine protrudes
into the groove, corresponding to an isoleucine (Ile931)
in GAP-334 (see below). p120GAP and NF1GRD are
inhibited by a large number of lipids, some of which act

differentially (Bollag and McCormick, 1991; Golubic
et al., 1991; Serth et al., 1991; Tsai et al., 1991). Using
appropriate concentrations of arachidonate, phosphatidate
and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, NF1GRD can
inhibited without disturbing p120GAP activity.

Likewise, dodecyl maltoside has been used to distin-
guish between neuroﬁbromin and p120GAP activity in
crude cell extracts (Bollag and McCormick, 1991). It is
probable that the amino acid composition in the groove
region contributes
signiﬁcantly to these differential
properties. The structure suggests that these properties
arise from a few residues in this region. Mutational
analysis would be a powerful tool to address this question
in more detail.

The ﬁnger loop appears to be more ﬂexible than in
GAP-334; as in GAP-334 the stretch preceding the ﬁnger
arginine (Arg1276) is stabilized by a phenylalanine and a
leucine participating in a hydrophobic core. The orientation
of the loop is stabilized by the FLR-arginine (Arg1391),
the structural and functional equivalent of Arg903 in GAP-
334. The N-terminal region of the ﬁnger loop appears to
be stabilized by Arg1375 which is packed against the
neighbouring Phe1376 and belongs to the loop connecting
helices α5c and α6c. In GAP-334 an equivalent situation
can be observed, where Lys884, packed against Trp885,
interacts with the N-terminal part of the ﬁnger loop. The
loop carrying Lys884 contains three residues more than
the NF1GRD counterpart and therefore appears as a
‘bulge’ in a structural overlay (Figure 1C). The variable
loop is in a similar conformation to that which it adopts
in GAP-334 with Ala948 as an extra amino acid in GAP-
334, in support of the idea that this loop is of variable
length in RasGAPs (Scheffzek et al., 1997).

Theminimumcatalyticdomain,acontroversy?
Conﬂicting evidence to localize the minimal fragment of
NF1GRD able to stimulate Ras-mediated GTP-hydrolysis
has been reported. Originally, a 483 residue fragment of
neuroﬁbromin was classiﬁed as a GAP-related domain
(Martin et al., 1990), and was later shown to have similar
enzymatic properties as full-length neuroﬁbromin (Bollag
and McCormick, 1993). In analogy to p120GAP where
the 334 C-terminal amino acids were shown to be sufﬁcient
for GAP activity (Marshall et al., 1989), NF1-333, homo-
logous in sequence to GAP-334, and similar constructs
were shown to be fully active and were extensively

binant expression studies showed a 230 residue fragment
(Asp1248 to Phe1477; Figure 2C) to retain full catalytic
activity (Ahmadian et al., 1996). From these experiments
together with the crystal structures of GAP-334 (Scheffzek
et al., 1996) and NF1GRD (this paper) we conclude that
the central domains indeed represent minimum RasGAP-
modules.

Using a deletion cloning approach a fragment of 91
amino acids (NF91; 1441–1531; Figure 2C) was identiﬁed
to reverse the malignant phenotype induced by v-H-Ras,
and to carry GAP activity, although 20-fold lower than
NF1GRD (Nur-E-Kamal et al., 1993). In the structure this
fragment would start at the C-terminal end of the variable
loop and comprise helices α8c, α4ex-α6ex (Figures 2C and
3), and thus be located completely outside the region that
has been found to interact with Ras in the Ras–RasGAP
complex (Scheffzek et al., 1997) and contains none of the
critical residues of RasGAPs. One would have to postulate
that the GAP activity reported for the NF91 fragment or
its smaller relative NF78 (Fridmann et al., 1994) occurs
by a mechanism that uses a protein–protein interface
different
the Ras–RasGAP
complex. Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg1441 which is
in a region reported to be critical for the function of
this fragment might be a useful approach to address
this issue.

Patientmutationsandstructure–functionstudies
Locations of mutations discussed in this section are
summarized in the model shown in Figure 3. A variety
of alterations in the NF1 gene have been found in tissues
from NF1 patients, with no apparent hot-spot region (Shen
et al., 1996). Very large deletions of up to 190 kb, and
nonsense mutations all lead to truncation of the protein
product, whereas small deletions induce frameshifts. A
limited number of missense mutations has been described,
20% of which are found in the catalytic and 1% in the
extra domain of NF1GRD, some of which affect the GAP-
activity (Figures 2A and C, and 3) (Li et al., 1992;
Purandare et al., 1994; Upadhyaya et al., 1997; Klose
et al., 1998; P.Nu¨rnberg, unpublished).

Lysine 1423 appears to be the most frequently altered
residue and has been found mutated to glutamate or
glutamine in neuroﬁbromas as well as in solid tumours
not associated with neuroﬁbromatosis, which reportedly
inhibits the GAP activity (Li et al., 1992; Upadhyaya
et al., 1997). Extensive analyses of this residue by site-
directed mutagenesis have tested every natural amino acid
substitution along with biochemical/biological character-
ization of the mutant proteins (Poullet et al., 1994). These
studies showed that the original wild-type residue lysine
in position 1423 is the only amino acid that results in a
functional protein, and suggest decreased Ras afﬁnity as
the major effect of Lys1423 mutations (Poullet et al.,
in line with earlier data on Lys1423→Ser by
1994),
Gutmann et al. (1993). In the structure, Lys1423 is located
on helix α7c from which it protrudes into the surface
groove to interact with Glu1437 (Figures 1B and 4). As
an analogous interaction is weak in isolated GAP-334
(Scheffzek et al., 1996) but very prominent in complex
with Ras (Scheffzek et al., 1997),
it appears to be
additionally stabilized during the interaction with the Ras
target; it is conceivable that charge inversion in this region

4317

K.Scheffzek etal.

(as in the mutation Lys1423→Glu) not only disrupts a
favourable internal interaction but might also contribute
to the accumulation of negative charges in the interface
region which is unfavourable for the mostly acidic effector
region of Ras entering the surface groove. Correspond-
ingly, the replacement by arginine has been scored as the
least, and by glutamate as the most severe mutation of
Lys1423 (Poullet et al., 1994). Involvement of Lys1423
in an intramolecular polar interaction was in fact proposed
by Wiesmu¨ller and Wittinghofer (1992) on the basis of
its mutation to methionine that produced a thermally
unstable protein.

In a yeast genetic screen, Poullet et al. (1994) identiﬁed

mutations of Phe1434 to serine or leucine as second site
suppressors of certain Lys1423 mutations. Phe1434 is
found in the middle of the variable loop L6c and in
concert with Met1440 and Phe1443 it contributes to core
stabilization (Figures 1B and 4). Its mutation to serine
would provide space and a hydrogen bonding partner for
neighbouring residues, while introduction of leucine would
predominantly modify the hydrophobic interaction pattern.
Considering the corresponding ‘ﬁrst site’ mutations of
Lys1423 it is difﬁcult to rationalize the suppressor effect
from presumed direct changes in the interaction patterns.
However, the architecture of the α7c/variable loop region
shows positions 1423 and 1434 in proximity to each other

(Figures 1B and 4) suggesting that they both contribute
to the properties of this region that obviously inﬂuences
the afﬁnity for Ras.

Apart from Lys1423, two other residues located in helix

α7c were found mutated in NF1 patients, Lys1419 and
Leu1425. Sporadic mutations of Lys1419 were found in
two cases, once mutated to glutamine (Upadhyaya et al.,
1997) and to arginine in a patient showing no apparent

4320

that

malignancy (Purandare et al., 1994), with no published
biochemical characterization available for either of them.
In the structure, Lys1419 protrudes into the surface groove
(Figures 1B and 4) and in a hypothetical complex with
Ras is in a position to form a salt bridge with Glu37
(see below) from the Ras effector region. Since the
corresponding residue in GAP-334 is an isoleucine
(Ile931; see above) one might predict that Lys1419 is
one of
the determinants of neuroﬁbromin’s higher
afﬁnity for Ras. Leucine 1425 (Klose et al., 1998) is
in the C-terminal half of helix α7c (Figure 3) and
mutation to proline would be likely to disrupt
the
helical geometry of this region, which contains residues
Lys1423, Gln1426 and Asn1430, that are all important
for successful interaction with Ras.
Serine 1468 is located in a presumed extended chain
following α8c, in a region not visible in our structure.
From its location at the C-terminus of NF1c one would
not expect
the mutation to glycine as found in
NF1-patients (Upadhyaya et al., 1997) interferes with
catalysing the GTPase on Ras. Upadhyaya et al. (1997)
have identiﬁed a patient mutation affecting Arg1391
(Arg1391→Ser),
that belongs to the FLR-ﬁngerprint
motif of RasGAPs. Arg1391 is involved in catalysis
(Mittal et al., 1996; Ahmadian et al., 1997b; Scheffzek
et al., 1997) and its replacement by serine was shown
to reduce GAP activity of neuroﬁbromin 300-fold,
although its role in binding and/or catalysis was not
differentiated (Upadhyaya et al., 1997). The importance
of this residue has been recognized in early studies on
p120GAP where mutation of Arg903 and Leu902
drastically interfered with GAP function (Brownbridge
et al., 1993; Skinner et al., 1994). Mittal et al. (1996)
have shown that
is no
longer able to form a ternary complex with Ras-GDP
and aluminium ﬂuoride (AlFx), the presumed transition
state analogue of the GTPase reaction, pointing towards
a contribution of
this residue in catalysis. Different
biochemical effects were observed by Upadhyaya et al.
(1997), Gutmann et al. (1993) and Ahmadian et al.
(1997b) for Arg1391 mutations, presumably reﬂecting
non-kinetic measurements under different conditions.
Under saturating, kinetically controlled conditions the
replacement of Arg1391 by alanine decreased the rate
of GTP hydrolysis 45-fold (Ahmadian et al., 1997b).
In the structure of NF1-333, Arg1391 stabilizes the
ﬁnger loop (L1c) by forming polar interactions with
main chain carbonyl oxygens of residues adjacent
to
Arg1276, the other invariant arginine of RasGAPs, that
is even more critical for catalysis (Figure 4; Ahmadian
et al., 1997b; see below). Shortening the Arg1391 side
than lysine
chain by introducing amino acids other
would disrupt
loop
and thus would be expected to interfere with GAP
function.
The substitution Arg1276→Pro was found as an
apparently spontaneous mutation in an NF1 patient with
a malignant schwannoma (Klose et al., 1998). It is the
ﬁrst reported case where a missense mutation in the
GRD shows such a particular severe phenotype. The
patient had no other alterations in the NF1 alleles
except
the second NF1 allele is lost, suggesting
that the loss of GAP function in this case was the major

cause of disease development. Biochemical analysis of
the recombinant mutant GRD suggested a structurally
intact protein that binds to Ras-GTP but whose GAP
activity is reduced 8000-fold, consistent with the ﬁnding
that
in the Ras–RasGAP complex the corresponding
residue Arg789 from GAP-334 is in a position to
stabilize the transition state of the GTPase reaction,
thus being crucial for GAP catalysis (Scheffzek et al.,
1997). The extremely critical role of this arginine has
been demonstrated in another study showing that
its
replacement by lysine or alanine decreases the reaction
rate by three orders of magnitude and abrogates the
ability to form a ternary complex with Ras-GDP and
AlFx (Ahmadian et al., 1997b). Given the similarity of
NF1GRD and GAP-334, Arg1276 can be predicted to
contact the nucleotide in a similar way as Arg789 does
in the Ras–RasGAP complex.

Site-directed mutagenesis of invariant or conserved
residues belonging to different regions of neuroﬁbromin
has been carried out by Gutmann et al. (1993) (Figure 3).
According to the qualitative effects on GAP activity
in vitro and the ability to suppress heat-shock sensitivity
in vivo, they were basically grouped into those that behave
like wild-type NF1GRD (Pro1395→Ile, Pro1400→Arg,
Asn1430→Met), those that showed no activity in vitro or
in vivo (Gln→1426Arg) and those that showed wild-
type activity in intact cells but no activity in vitro
(Glu1264→Tyr, Ala1281→Arg).
Proline 1395 and Pro1400 are located in the C-terminal
half of helix α6c and according to the Ras–RasGAP
structure overlay, substitution by isoleucine or arginine
need not necessarily interfere with Ras interaction, as
observed by the authors. Asparagine 1430 is located at
the C-terminal end of α7c (Figures 1B and 4), and the
mutation Asn1430→Met has a moderate effect on GAP
activity without disturbing the ability to complement
GAP function in yeast. A complementary mutation,
Asn1430→His, leads to higher Ras afﬁnity, supporting
the notion that this residue is involved in, but not crucial
for Ras interaction (Morcos et al., 1996).
substitutions Glu1264→Tyr, Ala1281→Arg,
Gln1426→Arg and Lys1423→Ser were reported to elimin-
ate GAP activity. Glutamate 1264,
invariant
residue in the GRD-chain, is located at the C-terminal
end of helix α1c (Figure 3) from where its carboxylate
group interacts with the hydroxyl group of Ser1279, which
belongs to the ﬁnger loop. The mutation to tyrosine might
lead to destabilization of the ﬁnger-loop region, thereby
abrogating GAP activity. Alanine 1281 sits at
the
N-terminus of helix α2c and is buried within a hydrophobic
core. Introduction of arginine in this region by the mutation
Ala1281→Arg would suggest disruption of structural
stability as the major cause for the observed loss of GAP
activity. Arginine in the position of Gln1426 (Figures 1B,
3 and 4) is presumably too large to be accommodated in
the Ras–NF1GRD interface region.
In the study by Gutmann et al. (1993) a deletion
(Δ53) spanning residues 1227–1281 was investigated,
and complete loss of GAP function reported. Since this
segment, which in the structure comprises basically the
ﬁnger loop with the preceding helices α3ex and α1c (Figure
3), contains the most critical arginine 1276, loss of GAP
activity for Δ53 is not surprising. On the other hand, since

removal of at least helix α1c is likely to disrupt the protein
core one would not even expect Δ53 to form a folded,
soluble protein.

restoring the inability of

A set of mutations was found in a screen for NF1GRD
the yeast Ras-
mutants
(Asp92→Lys) mutant (Wood et al., 1994) to interact with
NF1GRD (Morcos et al., 1996). Most of these can be
mapped to regions that belong to the surface groove of
NF1GRD (Figure 3) and some were reported to have
high afﬁnity to wild-type Ras as well. These include
Arg1413→Gly, Lys1436→Arg, Arg1391→Lys
and
Arg1276→Gly; Arg1413 belongs to a region that is not
well-deﬁned in our structure,
therefore the effect of
increased afﬁnity cannot be accounted for on the basis of
our model. Lysine 1436 together with the subsequent
glutamate deﬁnes the newly identiﬁed KE-motif in Ras-
GAPs that
is located on the tip of the variable loop
(Figures 1B, 3 and 4) (Scheffzek et al., 1997). In the
complex between Ras and GAP-334 it is in tight contact
with an acidic patch presented by the effector loop
(Scheffzek et al., 1997b). An arginine in this position
would allow for even more polar interactions with this
region and especially with Asp38, which is in excellent
agreement with the increased afﬁnity observed by Mori
et al. (1995), and as suggested by Nakafuku et al. (1993)
who showed that
this mutant can suppress oncogenic
Ras transformation by a mechanism distinct from its
GAP activity.
The effect of the increased afﬁnity of the Arg1391→Lys
mutant, also observed by Ahmadian et al. (1997b), and
of Arg1276→Gly cannot be directly rationalized from the
structure, but could indicate that the two arginines are not
only unnecessary for the ground state of the Ras–RasGAP
complex (Geyer et al., 1996; Ahmadian et al., 1997b),
but may actually be inhibitory to it.

LocationofthetypeIItranscriptinsertion
An isoform of neuroﬁbromin resulting from alternative
splicing has been found to be expressed in all tissues
examined, although the relative amounts vary (Nishi
et al., 1991; Suzuki et al., 1991; Andersen et al., 1993).
This so-called type II transcript involves the insertion
of a 21 amino acid stretch following Gln1370 (Figure
3) and has no counterpart in p120GAP, IRA1 and IRA2.
In the structural model an insertion in this position is
likely to disrupt the C-terminal part of helix α5c, and
to represent an exposed part of the GRD. From the
two
large number of charged residues (six lysines,
glutamates) clustered in the C-terminal half of
the
insertion, one might hypothesize that its function involves
the interaction with another protein, or maybe even
with other regions of neuroﬁbromin itself. Biochemical
analyses have detected weaker GAP activity of the type
II isoform as compared with type I (Andersen et al.,
1993), which is due to an apparent weaker binding to
Ras (Rey et al., 1994). From the structure of NF1GRD
and taking into consideration the complex of GAP-334
with Ras, the insertion need not directly interfere with
Ras binding, but rather modiﬁes the interaction by long-
range electrostatic contributions.

Tubulinbindingaspects
Neuroﬁbromin has been found associated with micro-
tubules, suggesting its involvement in microtubule-medi-

4322

ated signal transduction pathways (Gregory et al., 1993).
Tubulin inhibits GAP activity and the tubulin-binding
region appears to overlap with the GRD (Bollag et al.,
1993). The structure of tubulin and of a bacterial homo-
logue have been determined recently (Loewe et al., 1998;
Nogales et al., 1998), revealing albeit distant similarity to
the G-domain fold of Ras (Milburn et al., 1990; Pai et al.,
1990). This supports the observation that Ras and tubulin
share common binding sites on their neuroﬁbromin target.
Mutations of neuroﬁbromin critical for the interaction
with Ras have indeed been shown to affect the interaction
with cytoplasmic microtubules as well (Xu and Gutmann,
1997). However, marked differences in the interaction
patterns are to be expected, since the tubulin–neuroﬁbro-
min interaction depends on the presence of 80 residues
upstream of NF1-333 (Bollag et al., 1993) while the Ras–
NF1GRD interaction does not. In the NF1-333 structure
(as in GAP-334), N- and C-termini are in proximity to
each other (Figure 2A), raising the possibility that residues
from both the N- (1095–1198) and C-terminus (1530–
1569) of the GRD investigated by Bollag et al. (1993)
contribute to the architecture of a region critical for
tubulin binding.

ImplicationsfortheinteractionwithRas
The interaction of neuroﬁbromin with Ras has kinetic and
thermodynamic characteristics very different from that of
p120GAP. This reﬂects different physiological require-
ments for this interaction, as demonstrated by the different
localization of the two RasGAPs, the different phenotypes
of gene knockouts in mice (Brannan et al., 1994; Jacks
et al., 1994; Henkemeyer et al., 1995) and Drosophila
(Gaul et al., 1992; The et al., 1997), and the fact
that neuroﬁbromin but not p120GAP acts as a tumour
suppressor in humans. With the structure of NF1GRD and
that of the Ras–RasGAP complex represented by Ras-
GDP–AlF3–GAP-334 at hand (Scheffzek et al., 1997), we
are now able to propose a model for the NF1–Ras
interaction by aligning the central domains of NF1GRD
and GAP-334 in the Ras–RasGAP complex (Figure 5A).
Since the Ras–RasGAP complex was crystallized in the
presence of aluminium ﬂuoride, a transition state analogue
that is believed to mimic the phosphoryl group transferred
during the GTPase reaction (Chabre, 1990; Wittinghofer,
1997), we propose this model
to be an albeit rough
approximation of the transition state of the NF1GRD
accelerated GTPase reaction.

While GTP-hydrolysis rate enhancement by NF1GRD
is similar to that by GAP-334, binding afﬁnity for Ras
is ~50-fold larger with NF1GRD (Gideon et al., 1992;
Wiesmu¨ller and Wittinghofer, 1992; Brownbridge et al.,
1993; Eccleston et al., 1993; Ahmadian et al., 1997a).
Furthermore, both the association and dissociation rate
constants for the GAP-334–Ras interaction are too fast
to be measured, but can be estimated to be at least 2- and
100-fold faster than the interactions with neuroﬁbromin,
respectively. To understand this difference we have
investigated the regions of the GAP domains interacting
with Ras and screened for differences in amino acid
composition. From this comparison we found few amino
acids as candidate residues co-responsible for
the
difference in Ras afﬁnity. Lysine 1419 corresponds to
an isoleucine in GAP-334 and is in a position where

Another conspicuous difference in the Ras binding

It has been shown by biochemical and structural analyses
that the most important function of GAP is to supply an
arginine (the ﬁnger) situated on loop L1c (the ﬁnger loop)
into the active site of Ras to stabilize the transition state
of the GTPase reaction. A striking difference in the ﬁnger
loop region is Ala790 of GAP-334, which is a glycine in
most other RasGAPs including neuroﬁbromin (Figure 2C).
With glycine being situated next to the ﬁnger arginine
(Arg1276), NF1GRD might provide more ﬂexibility to
the ﬁnger loop and thus allow tighter binding to Ras.

stabilized by interactions with other regions of the protein,
most importantly with the arginine derived from the FLR-
motif located in the middle of helix α6c. We have
shown before that this supporting arginine is important in
catalysis in that its mutation to alanine reduces the activity
of NF1-333 50-fold and abrogates the ability to form a
ternary complex with Ras-GDP and AlFx, whereas muta-
tion to lysine barely affects catalysis (Ahmadian et al.,
1997b).
In the GAP-334 structure the N-terminal half of helix
α6c is slightly displaced compared with NF1GRD and
appears to be shifted towards the hydrophobic core,
stabilizing the helical arrangement. While most of the
hydrophobic amino acids located in helix α6c are largely
similar in NF1GRD and GAP-334, Ala1387 corresponds
to a phenylalanine (Phe899) that is tightly involved in
core stabilization. It appears that in the absence of the
equivalent side chain in NF1GRD, helix α6c is less ﬁrmly
anchored into the core and as a result (Figure 5B) the
ﬁnger loop might close further down, with Phe1275
becoming more deeply buried within the core. This idea
is supported by the observation that
in GAP-334 the
corresponding Phe788 undergoes hydrophobic interaction
with Phe899. As this is one of the most dramatic differ-
ences in the amino acid composition we propose it to
contribute at least in part to the structural differences in
this region and possibly also to differences in the inter-
action with Ras.

Summarizing the comparison between the Ras–GAP-
334 and Ras–NF1 interactions, we can observe that a
major difference between the two systems is an increased
ﬂexibility of NF1 compared with GAP-334. This might
contribute to the slower binding of Ras to NF1GRD,
which might need limited conformational adjustments in
the latter for tight binding. To compensate for the entropic
cost of the conformational change and to explain the
higher afﬁnity additional contact points in the interface
will be required, although they cannot be inferred from
the docking model. Once formed, however, the NF1GRD–
Ras complex is much tighter and has a much lower
dissociation rate constant.

The difference in binding properties probably reﬂects
the different physiological requirements of the two sys-
tems, with Ras localized in the plasma membrane and
p120GAP in the cytoplasm, and with the low afﬁnity and
low concentration of both proteins it is to be assumed that
they can only interact when GAP is relocalized to the
plasma membrane during signal transduction. Neuroﬁb-
romin is localized in the particulate fraction and its high-
afﬁnity binding to Ras may allow it to increase GTP
hydrolysis without translocation. The knowledge of the
structural requirements and the availability of cell lines
with the GAP and NF1 genes disrupted may allow us to
test whether engineering GAP to have neuroﬁbromin-
like properties and vice versa has any physiological
consequences in those cells.

Conclusions
The work reported in this paper characterizes the ﬁrst
functional domain of neuroﬁbromin in three dimensions.
In light of the various mutations found in NF1 patients or
investigated in structure–function studies, it gives insight

4324

into the structure of the GAP-related domain, which in
turn may serve as a resource for designing further studies
on the function of this protein. Together with the structure
of the Ras–RasGAP complex it provides a useful model
for analysis of various speciﬁc features of NF1GRD–Ras
interaction.

Materials and methods

Proteinpreparation
NF1-333 was expressed as a fusion protein with light meromyosin
(LMM) that contained a cleavage site for IgA protease (Ahmadian et al.,
1996). The fusion protein was puriﬁed according to Wolber et al. (1992)
and cleaved with IgA protease obtained as described (Ahmadian et al.,
1996). The puriﬁed protein was incubated with proteinase K (Boehringer
Mannheim) at a substrate to protease ratio of 4000:1 for 60 min and
then eluted from a gel ﬁltration column equilibrated with 30 mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 3 mM DTE. After concentration
to 20 mg/ml the protein was stored at –70°C and thawed immediately
before setting up crystallization drops. Further analysis was done by
mass spectroscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, including
N-terminal sequencing of blotted bands.

Crystallization
Crystallization was carried out at room temperature by the hanging drop
method, where equal amounts (1.5–2 μl) of protein and a solution
containing 18–22% poly-ethylene-glycol 3350 (PEG-3350; Sigma),
100 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 and 200 mM MgCl2 were mixed and equilibrated
against a reservoir (400 μl) containing the same solution without protein.
Crystals appeared after few hours or even minutes and grew within 2–
3 days to an average ﬁnal size of ~600⫻200⫻200 μm. Although all
preparations resulted in crystallizable protein, high quality crystals as
opposed to twinned forms were obtained only by strictly following the
preparation protocol. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group
C2 and contain one monomer in the asymmetric unit. They diffract to
~3 Å resolution using a rotating anode, and to better than 2.5 Å in a
synchrotron beam.

Datacollectionandstructuredetermination
Native data were collected using synchrotron radiation (λ ⫽ 0.91 Å) on
beam line X11 at EMBL Hamburg (c/o DESY). We used the rotation
method (oscillation angle, Δφ ⫽ 3°) with a MAR image plate detector
placed at a crystal-detector distance of 20 cm for data recording. Because
of radiation damage and since cryofreezing experiments were not
promising, we collected partial data sets from six native crystals
altogether, cooled to 4°C. Data processing with the program XDS
(Kabsch, 1993) and scaling resulted in a complete merged data set of
2.5 Å resolution (Table I).
Heavy atom derivatives of 12 compounds under various conditions
were prepared by soaking crystals in 400 μl of reservoir solution
containing 0.1–5 mM of the respective compound. An isomorphous
derivative was obtained by treatment of crystals with 0.5 mM methyl
mercury chloride (MMCl). A derivative containing K2PtCl4 was sufﬁ-
ciently isomorphous when pretreating crystals with MMCl. The effect
of MMCl pre-treatment for phasing by this derivative could be improved
by instead soaking the crystals in 2 mM iodo acetic acid containing
reservoir solution for 24 h before exposure to 0.2 mM K2PtCl4, as
described above. Derivative data were collected with the rotation method
on an area detector (Siemens/Nicolet) mounted before an oscillation
camera (Supper; crystal-detector distance, 10 cm; oscillation range,
0.0833°) and a rotating anode (Elliott GX-18; 35 kV/50 mA) with Franks
double mirror optics as the X-ray source. Each derivative data set was
collected from one single crystal, cooled to ~4°C. Data were processed
with XDS (Kabsch, 1993) and analysed with a program suite by
W.Kabsch (unpublished; Table I). The solvent-ﬂattened electron density
map (Figure 1A), calculated using the phases derived from the heavy
atom model, was readily interpretable and required the inversion of the
coordinates of heavy atom sites to be consistent with a protein composed
of L-amino acids. The GAP-334 model could be accommodated in this
map and was used as a guide in subsequent rounds of alternate model
building (program ‘O’; Jones et al., 1991) and reﬁnement with X-PLOR
(Version 3.851; Bruenger, 1991), including Powell minimization, simu-

lated annealing, and restrained individual temperature factor reﬁnement.
A bulk solvent correction was applied in the ﬁnal stages of reﬁnement.
Graphical representation of the model was done with the programs
Molscript (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Merritt and Bacon, 1997). The
Brookhaven Protein Data Bank accession code for the NF1GRD structure
is 1NF1.
