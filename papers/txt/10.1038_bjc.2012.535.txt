Background: The neurofibromatoses (NF) are genetic disorders. Increased risks of some cancers in people with NF are well
recognised, but there is no comprehensive enumeration of the risks across the whole range of site-specific cancers. Our aim was
to provide this.

Methods: A linked data set of hospital admissions and deaths in England was used to compare rates of tumours in an NF cohort
with rates in a comparison cohort, with results expressed as rate ratios (RR).

Results: The RR for all cancers combined, in people with both types of NF combined, was 4.3 (95% confidence interval (CI):
4.0–4.6), based on 769 cases of cancer in 8003 people with NF. Considering only people with presumed NF1 (as defined in the
main article), the RR for all cancers excluding nervous system malignancies remained elevated (2.7, 95% CI: 2.4–2.9); and risks were
significantly high for cancer of the oesophagus (3.3), stomach (2.8), colon (2.0), liver (3.8), lung (3.0), bone (19.6), thyroid (4.9),
malignant melanoma (3.6), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (3.3), chronic myeloid leukaemia (6.7), female breast (2.3) and ovary (3.7).

Conclusion: Neurofibromatosis was associated with an increased risk of many individual cancers. The relationships between NF
and cancers may hold clues to mechanisms of carcinogenesis more generally.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2
(NF2) are inherited, autosomal-dominant, tumour predisposition
syndromes (Ferner et al, 2007). Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the
more common, with a prevalence in the United Kingdom of about
1 in 4560 people. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a relatively rare
disorder affecting about 1 in 56 160 people (Evans et al, 2010).
Neurofibromatosis type 1 and NF2 have distinct genetic char-
acteristics, and each disease is associated with mutations in a
different gene. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by mutation on
chromosome 17q11.2 (Viskochil et al, 1990; Wallace et al, 1990).
This genetic abnormality affects synthesis of a tumour suppressor
protein, neurofibromin, which in unaffected individuals
is

expressed in high levels in the nervous system. Its deficit is
associated with the development of both benign and malignant
tumours (Johannessen et al, 2005, 2008; Jouhilahti et al, 2011).
Each of the two diseases has its distinct pathogenesis, clinical
features and prognosis, although the current 10th revision of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) does not distinguish
between them (World Health Organisation, 1992).

Patients with NF are at increased risk of neoplasia of several
types (Zo¨ller et al, 1995; Rasmussen et al, 2001; Walker et al, 2006;
Evans et al, 2011). The majority of NF1 patients develop benign
cutaneous neurofibromas (Ferner, 2010), and there is also an
elevated risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours and

Tumours associated with neurofibromatosis

connective tissue malignancies (Evans et al, 2002, 2011; Walker
et al, 2006). Well-documented neoplastic risks in people with NF2
are largely those of benign vestibular schwannomas or meningio-
mas (Ferner et al, 2004; Ferner, 2010). There are data suggesting
increased risks of other cancers,
including breast cancer and
leukaemia, among patients with NF1 (Stiller et al, 1994; Sharif et al,
2007). The possibility that NF may be associated with an increased
risk of other malignant neoplasms,
in addition to the already
recognised NF-associated cancers mentioned above, is not well
documented.

Because of

it

the known tumour-prone nature of NF,

is
important to have comprehensive estimates for the risk of different
individual malignant neoplasms, both for documented and for
hitherto undocumented tumour risks. This is important, both to
understand prognosis and risk in people with NF and to boost
further research into the relationship between NF and neoplasia.
Our aim was to quantify the risk in people with NF of
neoplasms of the nervous system, and of malignant tumours
outside the nervous system, systematically across the whole range
of cancer sites and types. We analysed data on hospitalisation of
people with NF, in the whole of England from 1999 to 2011, and
their risk of cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Populations and data sets. We used a linked English national
data set of hospital admissions (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES))
and mortality. Hospital Episode Statistics comprises routinely
collected administrative data on all hospital admissions and day
cases in all NHS hospitals in England, with brief statistical records
for every admission. The HES data were provided by the NHS
Information Centre, and the mortality data were derived from
death registration data provided by the Office for National
Statistics. All records of hospitalisation for each individual person,
and the individual’s death record in the event of death, were linked
together as a single record of cumulative events for each person.
The linkage was undertaken by the Oxford Record Linkage group
(Gill and Goldacre, 2003). The data set spanned 1 January 1999 to
28 February 2011.

Construction of cohorts. The ‘exposure’ cohort of people
with NF was constructed by identifying the first hospitalisation
or day case care for NF in the linked data set. We defined NF as
code Q 85.0 (termed ‘Neurofibromatosis’) in the 10th revision of
ICD. The coding system used in England does not distinguish
between NF1 and NF2. We made the assumption that people with
any record of schwannoma, meningioma, acoustic neuroma and
sensorineural deafness had NF2 and defined a second cohort
excluding them.

We constructed a reference cohort, comprising people hospi-
talised with a range of mainly minor medical conditions, a range of
surgical procedures and a range of
injuries (see footnote to
Table 1). These conditions and operations, both individually and in
combination, were selected as conditions that were considered very
unlikely to be associated with either an atypically high or low risk
of cancers. We also have experience in using the reference cohort
in other studies of cancer risk in people with non-malignant
chronic conditions and know that they do not give atypical values
(Goldacre et al, 2007, 2009; Fois et al, 2010). We included all
eligible patients in the reference cohort. We stratified patients in
the exposure and reference cohorts by age, sex, region of residence,
calendar year of
first hospitalisation and Index of Multiple
Deprivation (a standard English metric for socioeconomic status,
analysed by us in quintiles). All calculations of expected and

observed cancers (see below) were undertaken within these strata
(i.e., they were based on people who were the same, in respect of
age group, gender, etc) and were then summed across strata to give
overall expected and observed cases of each cancer.

The data set was

searched for any subsequent hospital
admission for, or death from, malignant neoplasms. We used the
ICD-10 codes C00–C75, C80–C97 for all cancers, and their
equivalents
in ICD-9. We estimated the risk of malignant
neoplasm for every type of cancer, and the risk of benign tumours
of nervous system, at the three-digit level in the ICD. We excluded
those patients who had a record of cancer before their first
recorded admission for NF (468 cases), and we excluded people
with a first record of NF on the same admission record as a cancer
(833 cases). We did this to avoid surveillance bias, since cancer
could have been diagnosed as a result of admission for NF, or,
alternatively, NF could have been recorded because the patient
needed care for cancer.

We repeated all analyses on the cohort of presumed NF1 cases only.

Statistical methods. Separate analyses were done for each cancer
as described using the example of malignant brain tumour. Rates of
malignant brain tumour were calculated based on person years.
The ‘date of entry’ into the NF cohort, or the reference cohort, was
the date of first admission for NF, or the reference condition. The
‘date of exit’ was the date of subsequent admission for malignant
brain tumour (if any occurred), or death, or the end of the data file
(28 February 2011), whichever was the earliest. Patients were
censored from further follow-up on the exact day of first admission
for malignant brain tumour or death.

We used the indirect method of standardisation, taking the
combined NF and reference cohorts as the standard population.
The stratum-specific rates in the standard population were applied
first to the NF cohort, and then, separately, to the reference cohort,
in order to obtain the ‘expected’ number of cases of cancers in each
individual cohort based on the stratum-specific rates in the two
cohorts combined. The ratio of the standardised rate of occurrence of
malignant brain tumour in the NF cohort was calculated relative to
that in the reference cohort using the formula (ONF/ENF)/(Oref/Eref),
where O is the observed and E is the expected number of cases of
malignant brain tumour in each cohort. This follows the methods
described in detail by us elsewhere (Fois et al, 2010), and by
Breslow and Day (1987). The analysis was done using a suite of
programs developed ‘in house’ using SAS 9 software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).

RESULTS

There were 8003 people hospitalised with NF over the study
period. There were 6739 people in the cohort of presumed NF1.
Their age and sex distributions are given in Supplementary
Appendix 1 and 2 (online only), which also show the ratio of the
number of people in the reference cohort per person in the NF
cohort. There were generally about 1000 people in the reference
cohort for each person in each 5-year age stratum in the NF cohort,
that is, there were ample numbers to ensure adequate stratification
and standardisation.

The rate ratio (RR) of cancers in the total NF cohort relative to
the reference cohort was 4.3 (95% confidence interval (95% CI):
4.0–4.6), based on 769 observed cases in the NF cohort. In the
cohort of people with presumed NF1, that is, after excluding all
patients with schwannomas, meningiomas, acoustic neuromas and
sensorineural deafness, the RR remained elevated at 4.0 (95% CI:
3.7–4.3, based on 697 observed cases).

The RRs for individual malignant and benign neoplasms of the
nervous system in the whole NF cohort, and in the NF1 cohort, are
shown in Table 1. The RRs of hospital admission for malignant

and benign neoplasm of peripheral nerves, spinal cord, cranial
nerves, central nervous system and eye were very high. Table 2
shows the data for individual malignant tumours in the NF1
cohort. For most, the RRs were very similar in the NF1 and the
total NF cohort (for the latter, see Supplementary Appendix 3). Of
the other tumours, risks were very high for cancers of the ‘heart
mediastinum and pleura’, ‘retroperitoneum and peritoneum’, ‘bone
and cartilage’, ‘connective and other soft tissue’, small intestine and
adrenal gland (Table 2). These are all cancers that are very
uncommon in the general population and the ICD coding
structure is such that their precise nature cannot be identified
from the coding, except that all cases of adrenal cancer were
cancers of the adrenal medulla. Considering cancers that are more
common in the general population, and the NF1 cohort, we found
significantly elevated risks for cancers of the oesophagus (RR: 3.3;
see Table 2 for CIs), stomach (2.8), colon (2.0), liver (3.8), biliary
tract (8.2), pancreas (3.4),
lung and bronchus (3.0), malignant
melanoma (3.6), non-melanoma skin cancer (1.6), thyroid gland
(4.9), female breast (2.3), ovarian cancers (3.7) and several others
(Table 2). There were elevations of risk of haematological cancers,
notably diffuse non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (RR: 3.3), other and
unspecified non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (2.3), lymphoid leukaemia
(2.5), acute (4.2) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (6.7). Some of
these cancers were identified from a subsequent hospital admis-
sion that was fairly close in time after the admission for NF; others
were first identified more than a year after the NF admission
(Supplementary Appendix 3).

Additionally, we estimated RRs for breast cancer in women aged
under 50 years (i.e., younger than the age at which women in
England are routinely invited for mammographic screening) and
50 plus. Younger women with NF had a high risk of breast cancer
at RR 3.6 (95% CI: 2.5–5.0, based on 34 observed cases). In women
aged Z50, RR was 1.5 (95% CI: 1–2.2) based on 24 cases. After

excluding the first year following hospital admission for NF, the
risk remained high (RR: 3.3, 2.2–4.8) in younger women, but not in
those aged 50 and older.

DISCUSSION

Principal
findings. We have systematically documented and
quantified the risk of each individual malignant neoplasm at the
three-digit level of the ICD in patients hospitalised with NF in a
large defined population. Over the 13-year period, with mean
follow-up B6 years, 697 out of 6739 patients with NF1 (10.3%)
developed subsequent neoplasms. As expected, the highest rates,
compared with rates in the reference population, were for tumours
of the nervous system, brain and eye. Overall, there was a four-fold
increase in risk of tumours. After excluding the well-known risks of
the nervous system tumours, the RR remained high at 2.7. Some of
the highest RRs, besides those relating to nervous system sites, were
in relation to cancers that are very uncommon in the general
population. We cannot interpret this finding; but it may signify
that the mechanisms that generally protect against these cancers
need a very specific set of circumstances (e.g., a genetic disorder
like NF) to affect them. We also found that many common cancers
have an elevated risk, with RRs of around two to four, in people
with NF.

Limitations of the study. An important limitation is that there are
no separate codes for NF type 1 and type 2 in the version of ICD
used in English medical coding. We contacted the two English
national data custodians, the NHS Information Centre for hospital
statistics, and the Office for National Statistics for mortality
statistics, to ask if they have unofficial codes (i.e., beyond the
standard ICD codes) to distinguish the two types of NF. Both

confirmed that they did not; and both confirmed that we were the
first to raise this with them. The Office for National Statistics
offered to review some of its death certificates that included NF. It
reported that, on the majority of them, the type of NF had not been
provided by the certifying doctor. Thus, the issue in routine
medical information systems is not just one of ICD coding; it is one
of encouraging certifying clinicians to record the type of NF. It is
likely that other studies of NF, using routine data systems, have
encountered similar issues. We made an attempt to restrict a subset
of the NF cohort to just those people with NF1. We did so by
excluding people with schwannomas, meningiomas, acoustic

neuromas and sensorineural deafness, which are clinical features of
NF2. They were identified by record linkage to all the individuals’
records before, during and after the first admission for NF. This
may not have identified all people who should have been excluded:
some may have had admissions for these exclusion conditions
before or after the timespan covered by the record-linkage study.
Accordingly, and also because others may not be able to
distinguish types 1 and 2 in their own studies, for the record we
give the full data on all NF in Supplementary Appendix 3. We
advocate that concerns about the recording and coding of NF1
and NF2 should be raised with clinicians treating NF patients

(to record the type) and with organisations that manage national
statistics (to code the two types separately).

We can partially address the question of whether we are likely to
have identified a majority of patients with NF in England through
the hospitalisation data. At a prevalence of 1 in 4560 in a
population of 50 million, there would be about 10 965 people with
NF1; we identified 6739 people in the NF cohort, and a further
1301 before or at the same time as entry to the NF cohort, that is,
about 73% of the likely total in England. The great majority of
people with cancer are likely to be admitted and so reliance on
hospitalisation and death should not miss many cases of the
‘outcome’ diseases. Although it is possible that some cases of NF
were misdiagnosed, for example with lypomatosis or shwannoma-
tosis,
it is unlikely that the proportion misdiagnosed was big
enough to affect the results materially. Our analysis is based on
information recorded in hospital settings and the majority of
diagnoses, if not all, would have been made by clinical specialists.
Diagnostic coding in routine hospital statistics in England is
generally accurate (Burns et al, 2011) and it is likely that the
majority of common malignant tumours were accurately recorded.
However, some misclassification is possible for less common
tumours: for example, some cases of retroperitoneal malignancies
or submucosal small bowel tumours might in fact have been
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.

We studied a large number of associations between diseases.
The effect of making multiple comparisons should be considered.
It is possible that some of the associations that are significant at
conventional
from making
multiple comparisons and the play of chance, but where the
P-value is 0.001 or lower as seen in Tables 1 and 2, it is unlikely to
be attributable to chance alone.

levels of significance may result

A further limitation is that the NF cases are prevalent, not incident,
cases. We do not have the individuals’ full history; and someone whose
first admission for NF, as recorded in the data set, may have already
had the condition, manifested clinically, for many years (i.e., prior to
the establishment of the data set). The age distribution (Supplementary
Appendix 1, 2) should be considered bearing this in mind.

Information on possible confounding factors, including smok-
ing, diet and treatment, was not available, and neither was any
genetic history.

Strengths. This was a population-based study with a large sample
size and a 13-year period of coverage. The number of patients with
NF in this study was larger than in any previously published work.
The coding of the diagnosis of NF (apart from type) and the
cancers is likely to have been reliable – the coding is very
straightforward. However, current privacy regulations preclude
sampling medical case notes to check.

Existing literature. Among patients with NF, increased mortality
associated with malignant neoplasm has been reported in studies
conducted in Sweden (Zo¨ller et al, 1995), the United Kingdom
(Evans et al, 2011), the United States (Rasmussen et al, 2001) and
several other countries (Imaizumi, 1995; Duong et al, 2011;
Masocco et al, 2011). Our findings, on elevated overall risk of
cancer, are consistent with the literature (Rasmussen et al, 2001;
Walker et al, 2006; Evans et al, 2011). Findings similar to our four-
fold increase in the risk of malignancy have been reported by
groups from Denmark and Sweden (Sorensen et al, 1986; Zo¨ller
et al, 1997). A recent study of cancer incidence in NF1 in the
United Kingdom also showed an increased overall risk of cancers
(Walker et al, 2006), similar in magnitude to our reported risk. In
the UK study, the authors suggested that elevation of cancer risk in
NF1 patients was mainly attributable to the high risk of
malignancies of connective tissue, central and peripheral nerve
tissue, and did not demonstrate an increased risk of cancers of
other sites. However, their study was based on only 448 individuals
with NF1, identified through the Neurofibromatosis Association

UK, with 36 people who had developed malignant tumours and it
would not have had the statistical power to identify risks of
different individual malignancies.

Sharif et al (2007) reported an increased risk of breast cancer
among female patients with NF1. We show a similarly high risk of
breast cancer, notably a three-fold risk in women under 50, and
consideration could be given to lowering the age at which breast
cancer screening is offered to women with NF.

Our study showed a RR of more than two for non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and leukaemia, in line with that reported by Stiller in
the United Kingdom and Matsui in Japan (Matsui et al, 1993;
Stiller et al, 1994). Although NF1-associated skeletal problems and
abnormal bone metabolism have been reported (Tucker et al,
2009), an increased risk of bone cancer in people with NF has not
previously been reported. Phaeochromocytoma is known to be
more common in patients with NF1 than in the general population
(Zinnamosca et al, 2011). We found 12 cases of malignant
neoplasm of the adrenal medulla, where most cases of phaeochro-
mocytoma arise, and none coded as cancer of the adrenal cortex.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report on the
increased risk of several gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancer, skin
malignancies,
thyroid cancer, a number of haematological
malignancies and cancer of ovary (Table 2). Johannessen et al
(2005) described NF1 as a ‘familial cancers syndrome’ and
provided a robust genetic explanation for the increased risk of
malignant tumours in people with NF1. Our findings on the
elevation of risk of a wide range of cancers have biological
plausibility.

CONCLUSIONS

First, we have shown associations between NF and a wide range of
individual malignancies. If our findings on risks of individual
cancers that are not already well documented are confirmed
elsewhere, they have implications for understanding prognosis in
people with NF, and, where appropriate, for the possibility of
anticipatory care and screening. Second, the clinical recording and
ICD coding of NF is suboptimal and should be improved. Third,
large-scale epidemiological studies based on nationwide data sets
that accumulate a large number of observations offer opportunities
for studying the epidemiology of rare conditions, like NF, that
would be difficult to study on such a scale in other study designs.
