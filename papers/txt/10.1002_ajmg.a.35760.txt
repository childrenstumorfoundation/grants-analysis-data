Schwannomatosis is the third major form of neuroﬁbromatosis
and is characterized by the development of multiple schwanno-
mas in the absence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The
2011 Schwannomatosis Update was organized by the Children’s
Tumor Foundation (www.ctf.org) and held in Los Angeles, CA,
from June 5–8, 2011. This article summarizes the highlights
presented at the Conference and represents the ‘‘state-of-the-
ﬁeld’’ in 2011. Genetic studies indicate that constitutional muta-
tions in the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene occur in 40–50%
of familial cases and in 8–10% of sporadic cases of schwanno-
matosis. Tumorigenesis is thought to occur through a four-hit,
three-step model, beginning with a germline mutation in
SMARCB1 (hit 1), followed by loss of a portion of chromosome
22 that contains the second SMARCB1 allele and one NF2 allele
(hits 2 and 3), followed by mutation of the remaining wild-type
NF2 allele (hit 4). Insights from research on HIV and pediatric
rhabdoid tumors have shed light on potential molecular
pathways that are dysregulated in schwannomatosis-related
schwannomas. Mouse models of schwannomatosis have been
developed and promise to further expand our understanding of

INTRODUCTION

Schwannomatosis is a form of neuroﬁbromatosis that is clinically
and genetically distinct from neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and
neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2). Schwannomatosis is characterized
by the predisposition to develop multiple schwannomas, but the
clinical spectrum continues to expand as more cases are reported.
Because the phenotype of schwannomatosis overlaps with NF2, the
ﬁrst published reports did not appear in the literature until the
1990s. By 2003, genetic studies showed that the NF2 locus was
excluded as the cause for familial schwannomatosis. The candidate
region for the causative gene was narrowed during the 2000s, and in
2007, Hulsebos et al. reported a constitutional SMARCB1 mutation
in a family affected by schwannomatosis. Since 2007, research on
the genetic and molecular basis of schwannomatosis has expanded.
The Children’s Tumor Foundation sponsored a conference held in
Los Angeles, CA, on June 5–8, 2011 in which about 30 schwanno-
matosis researchers and clinicians discussed recent advances in the
genetics, biology, and clinical description of schwannomatosis.
This article provides a synopsis of the highlights presented at the
Conference and as such, is a ‘‘state-of-the-ﬁeld’’ for schwannoma-
tosis research in 2011.

MEETING UPDATE
Genetics

Genetic identiﬁcation of SMARCB1. Schwannomatosis is
characterized by the development of multiple schwannomas.
Only about 15 years ago, schwannomatosis was recognized as a
clinical entity that is distinct from neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2)
[MacCollin et al., 1996; Evans et al., 1997]. Genetic evidence that
schwannomatosis is different from NF2 was initially provided by
the molecular analysis of schwannomas of schwannomatosis
patients. These studies revealed that the multiple tumors of indi-
vidual patients harbored independent mutations in the NF2 gene,
which were not present in their respective constitutional DNAs
[Jacoby et al., 1997; Kaufman et al., 2003]. Subsequent linkage
analyses in schwannomatosis families excluded the NF2 gene as the
schwannomatosis-predisposing gene and suggested a location of
this gene near marker D22S1174, which is about 6 cM centromeric
to the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. Hulsebos et al. [2007]
considered the SMARCB1 gene to be an attractive candidate
gene for schwannomatosis, because it was a known tumor sup-

pressor gene and located at a very short distance from marker
D22S1174. Indeed, they identiﬁed an inactivating germline muta-
tion in exon 1 of the SMARCB1 gene in a father and daughter who
both had schwannomatosis. In addition, in accordance with the
tumor suppressor gene model, they found inactivation of the wild-
type copy of the SMARCB1 gene, by a second inactivating mutation
or by deletion, in schwannomas of the patients. These ﬁndings
identiﬁed the SMARCB1 gene as a predisposing gene in
schwannomatosis.

Studies by others have conﬁrmed the involvement of the
SMARCB1 gene in 40–50% of familial and less than 10% of sporadic
cases of schwannomatosis [Boyd et al., 2008; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008;
Sestini et al., 2008; Rousseau et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2012]. In these
studies, additional somatic inactivation of the NF2 gene was
reported for the schwannomas. In SMARCB1 mutation-positive
schwannomas, the deletions always involved loss of one copy of
chromosome 22 [Hadﬁeld et al., 2010b]. These observations
suggest a four-hit, three-step model of tumorigenesis, in which
the mutated germline SMARCB1 gene copy is retained in the tumor
(hit 1), whereas chromosome 22, or at least a segment containing
the wild type SMARCB1 gene copy and a wild-type copy of the NF2
gene, is lost (hits 2 and 3), followed by mutation of the remaining
wild-type NF2 gene copy (hit 4) (Fig. 1).

Conﬂicting evidence exists with regard to the involvement of the
SMARCB1 gene in the development of multiple meningiomas.
Somatic mutations in the SMARCB1 gene have been shown to
occur in sporadic meningiomas, although at low frequency (<3%
of cases) [Bruder et al., 1999; Schmitz et al., 2001; Rieske et al.,
2003]. However, germline mutations in the SMARCB1 gene
could not be detected in 47 patients with multiple meningiomas,
including eight familial cases [Hadﬁeld et al., 2010a]. On the other
hand, the inheritance of a germline mutation in the SMARCB1 gene
was found in two families with schwannomatosis and multiple

germline mutation in SMARCB1 (hit 1), and is followed by loss of a
portion of chromosome 22 that contains the second SMARCB1
allele and one NF2 allele (hits 2 and 3), and by mutation of the
remaining wild-type NF2 allele (hit 4).

meningiomas [Bacci et al., 2010; Christiaans et al., 2011]. For the
meningiomas in one of these families, it could be demonstrated that
the four-hit, three step model also applies to these tumors, and that
the cranial meningiomas were preferentially located at the falx
cerebri [van den Munckhof et al., 2012].

Despite the frequent combination of germline SMARCB1 and
somatic NF2 mutations, a large proportion of familial schwanno-
matosis patients and the majority of sporadic schwannomatosis
patients have no known causative mutation [Boyd et al., 2008;
Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Sestini et al., 2008; Rousseau et al., 2011; Smith
et al., 2012]. In addition, there are currently no known causative
genes for multiple meningiomas unrelated to NF2 or schwanno-
matosis. This leaves open the possibility of discovering further
predisposing, or modiﬁer, genes. Recent developments in technol-
ogies such as whole genome and whole exome sequencing analysis
have now made them accessible for use in identiﬁcation of these
novel genes, which will help to elucidate the overall affected cellular
pathways involved. This will then indicate targets for the develop-
ment of novel therapies.

GENOTYPE–PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In addition to schwannomatosis, germline mutations in the
SMARCB1 gene cause the inherited prediposition to rhabdoid
tumors characterized by the presence of malignant rhabdoid
tumors of
teratoid/rhabdoid tumors
(AT/RT) of CNS, and extra-renal rhabdoid tumors that develop
in childhood [Versteege et al., 1998; Hulsebos et al., 2007]. The
factors determining which patients will develop schwannomatosis
and which will develop rhabdoid tumors are unclear. Non-
penetrance of rhabdoid tumors in patients with germline mutations
of SMARCB1 leaves open the possibility that surviving mutation
carriers will develop schwannomas later in life. However, it is
extremely rare to ﬁnd both phenotypes in the same family.
Currently, there are only three reported families in which either
rhabdoid tumors or schwannomas are seen in different family
members with the same inherited mutation. The schwannomas
seen in these patients seem to differ histologically from those
typically found in schwannomatosis [Swensen et al., 2009; Eaton
et al., 2011a; Carter et al., 2012]. The causative mutations in these
families are predicted to cause truncation of the protein.

There is a direct correlation between rhabdoid tumors and
SMARCB1 inactivation, as >95% of tumors show biallelic loss
of this gene due to deletions, nonsense and frameshift mutations, or
lack of mRNA and protein. Germline mutations in SMARCB1 are
found in one third of patients with rhabdoid tumors and tend to be
truncating (frameshift/nonsense) mutations, or deletions of one or
more exons, leading to a complete knockout of the SMARCB1 gene
[Bourdeaut et al., 2011; Eaton et al., 2011b]. This is coupled with a
somatic mutation of the second allele, leading to biallelic inacti-
vation of SMARCB1.

In contrast, inherited mutations found in familial schwannoma-
tosis are more likely to be non-truncating (missense or splice-site)
mutations [Boyd et al., 2008; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008], which might
for the milder phenotype as these are potentially
account
hypomorphic. However,
sporadic schwannomatosis patients
may carry truncating (frameshift or nonsense) or non-truncating

(missense/splice-site) mutations [Rousseau et al., 2011; Smith et al.,
2012], which are predicted to knock out the protein product.
Schwannomatosis-associated SMARCB1 mutations do seem to
be more frequent at either end of the gene whereas mutations
associated with the inherited prediposition to rhabdoid tumors are
more centrally located. It is possible that the speciﬁc combination of
resulting somatic mutations, including the frequent co-mutation of
the NF2 gene in tumors from schwannomatosis patients [Boyd
et al., 2008; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008], may regulate the severity of the
resulting phenotype. However, given the relatively small number of
families published with each phenotype more work is required
to understand why the mutation patterns in schwannomatosis
families are distinct and usually separate from patients with the
inherited prediposition to rhabdoid tumors.

INHERITANCE

The majority of cases of schwannomatosis are sporadic [Evans et al.,
1997; Antinheimo et al., 2000; Gonzalvo et al., 2011]. Case series
suggest that only around 15–25% of cases are inherited from an
affected parent. Conﬁrmation of a germline SMARCB1 mutation
will prove the inherited nature of disease and conﬁrm a 50% risk of
transmission to the next generation. However, only about 10% of
sporadic cases and 40–60% of inherited cases have an identiﬁable
mutation [Boyd et al., 2008; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Rousseau et al.,
2011]. The transmission risk can be assumed to be 50% in an
individual with schwannomas who has a proven family history
regardless of SMARCB1 status, but the risks for a sporadic case are
less clear. Even with exclusion of SMARCB1, it must be assumed
that there is still a small risk of transmission to offspring. Quantify-
ing transmission risk is also complicated by phenotypic overlap
between patients with sporadic schwannomatosis and mosaic
NF2, since the latter patients may fulﬁll current schwannomatosis
criteria [Baser et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2006]. Mosaicism also
exists for SMARCB1 [Hulsebos et al., 2010], although the frequency
of SMARCB1 mosaicism is still not clear. Nonetheless, mosaicism
may account for a further proportion of sporadic schwannomatosis
cases. Non-penetrance has been described in schwannomatosis
although this appears at present to be less likely in SMARCB1
families. Ideally, molecular analysis of the NF2 and SMARCB1 genes
from two separate tumors from an individual are required to
conﬁrm an underlying diagnosis.

CELL BIOLOGY
Function of SMARCB1

SMARCB1 and the SWI/SNF complex. Eukaryotic epigenetic
regulation is mediated by chromatin remodeling factors that are
high molecular weight multi-subunit protein complexes [Martens
and Winston, 2003; Cairns, 2007; Osley et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2007; van Vugt et al., 2007; Racki and Narlikar, 2008]. These
complexes can be divided into two general groups: Those that
covalently modify histones and DNA by acetylation/deacetylation
or methylation/demethylation, and those that use the energy of
ATP to reorganize/reposition the nucleosomes. The latter com-
plexes do not modify the chromatin in a covalent manner although

they may indirectly inﬂuence such modiﬁcations [Banine et al.,
2005; Datta et al., 2005].

SMARCB1 (also called hSNF5, INI1, and BAF47) is a component
of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, a prototypical ATP-depend-
ent chromatin remodeling complex consisting of at least nine
subunits that are conserved among eukaryotes (Fig. 2) [Wang
et al., 1996a; Wang et al., 1996b; Narlikar et al., 2002; Martens
and Winston, 2003]. Among these are four core subunits required
for chromatin remodeling, including an ATPase (SWI2/SNF2/
BRG1 or BRM1), SMARCB1, BAF155, and BAF170 [Martens
and Winston, 2003]. Among these, BRG1 and BAF155 are known
to play critical roles in mammalian nervous system development
[Kim et al., 2001; Seo et al., 2005; Matsumoto et al., 2006; Lessard
et al., 2007].

Several functionally distinct classes of SWI/SNF complexes have
been recognized in eukaryotes. Two major classes include hSWI/
SNF-A or BAF (BRG1-associated Factor) complex and hSWI/SNF-
B or PBAF complex. The two classes of complexes are distinguished
by the presence of speciﬁc subunits [Martens and Winston, 2003;
van Vugt et al., 2007]. Additional complexes containing mixtures of
components of SWI/SNF and HDAC1 complexes have also been
identiﬁed (See Fig. 2) [Martens and Winston, 2003]. Since
SMARCB1 is present in all of these complexes, understanding
the distinct roles played by these various complexes will be essential
for deciphering the role of SMARCB1 in schwannomatosis.

The functions of non-catalytic subunits of SWI/SNF complexes,
including SMARCB1, are not completely understood. The compo-
nents of the SWI/SNF complex do not have sequence-speciﬁc DNA
binding activity and hence they are targeted to speciﬁc promoter
regions via protein–protein interactions with sequence-speciﬁc
transcription factors, either activators or repressors [Cairns,
1998; Cheng et al., 1999; Kingston and Narlikar, 1999; Martens
and Winston, 2003; Cairns, 2007; Racki and Narlikar, 2008].

Structure/function analysis of SMARCB1. SMARCB1 was
originally called INI1 and was originally identiﬁed as an interacting
protein for HIV-1 integrase (IN) [Kalpana et al., 1994]. Structure/
function analysis has revealed that SMARCB1 has three conserved
domains. Two of these domains (Rpt I and Rpt II) are direct and
imperfect repeats of each other, and the Rpt I domain is necessary
and sufﬁcient to bind to HIV-1 IN in vitro and in vivo [Morozov

et al., 1998; Yung et al., 2001]. SMARCB1 is also engaged in protein–
protein interactions with other viral and cellular proteins (Fig. 3)
[Wu et al., 1996; Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 1999;
Lee et al., 1999]. Viral proteins include the E1 protein of human
papilloma virus 18 and the EBNA-2 protein of Epstein–Barr virus
[Wu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2000]. The cellular
proteins
include MYC, MLL (HXR), GADD34, and AKT
[Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 1999; Wu et al.,
2002; Foster et al., 2006]. Furthermore, SMARCB1 harbors addi-
tional
functional domains including a nuclear export signal
that is constitutively activated by the deletion of the C-terminal
regions, a homology region III, a non-speciﬁc DNA binding
domain, and a region involved in nuclear import (Fig. 3)
[Morozov et al., 1998; Craig et al., 2002]. Mutations of SMARCB1
in schwannomatosis span all these domains and hence under-
standing of speciﬁc roles played by these domains will provide
insight into its function.

Role of SMARCB1 in HIV-1 replication. Understanding its
interactions with HIV-1 IN may reveal clues about the functions of
SMARCB1. It has been reported that SMARCB1 has a multifaceted
role in HIV-1 replication. Binding of IN to SMARCB1 may facilitate

targeting of incoming HIV-1 viral DNA into open chromatin
regions in infected cells [Kalpana et al., 1994; Lesbats et al.,
2011]. SMARCB1 is also required for post-integrational events
of HIV-1 viral assembly and particle production in the cytoplasm
[Yung et al., 2001; Yung et al., 2004; Sorin and Kalpana, 2006].
These studies indicate an undeﬁned function for SMARCB1 outside
the nucleus in the cell, and understanding these roles may provide
novel insight into its role in schwannomatosis and other cancers.
Furthermore, SMARCB1 also has been demonstrated to bind to the
HIV-1 trans-activator protein, Tat, and to activate transcription of
the HIV-1 promoter within its long terminal repeats [Ariumi et al.,
2006; Mahmoudi et al., 2006].

Crosstalk between merlin and the HIV-1 host proteins. Studies
indicate a four-hit mechanism for genesis of schwannomatosis
where mutations in both NF2 and SMARCB1 genes lead to patho-
genesis. Currently, the functional interaction and relationship
between SMARCB1 and NF2 are unknown. However, it is intrigu-
ing to note that there is interplay between NF2 and the cellular
factors that inﬂuence HIV-1 replication.

CLR4DCAF1 or VprBP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to an
HIV-1 encoded accessory protein called Vpr. This association of
Vpr with CLR4DCAF1 appears to be required for inducing G2/M
arrest [DeHart et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2012]. Recent studies indicate
that merlin also associates with CLR4DCAF1 in the nucleus and
suppresses its activity and tumorigenesis [Li et al., 2010].

TRBP (transactivator-responsive RNA binding protein) is
another HIV-1 host protein that binds to HIV-1 encoded Tat
[Bannwarth and Gatignol, 2005; Corbeau, 2008; Clerzius et al.,
2011]. TRBP is a Dicer co-factor required for cellular RNA inter-
ference (RNAi). HIV-1 Tat suppresses the RNAi by sequestration of
TRBP away from the Dicer complex. Merlin also seems to inhibit
TRBP, which has growth-promoting potential, by ubiquitination
and degradation of TRBP protein [Lee et al., 2004]. Whether or not
these interactions of merlin with HIV-1 host proteins have anything
to do with SMARCB1 is unclear at this point.

Tumor suppressor function of SMARCB1. Various studies have
indicated that SMARCB1 exerts its tumor suppressor function by:
(i) inducing G1 arrest; (ii) inducing mitotic arrest; (iii) inhibiting
aneuploidy and causing diploidization; and (iv) inducing senes-
cence [Kalpana and Smith, 2010; Wilson and Roberts, 2011].
Induction of G0/G1 arrest by SMARCB1 is
correlated
with down-regulation of cyclin D1 [Zhang et al., 2002] and up-
regulation of p16INK4a [Betz et al., 2002]. The cyclin D1 gene
appears to be essential for genesis of tumors due to loss of Smarcb1
in mouse models as Smarcb1 þ/  heterozygous mice in combi-
nation with cyclin D1 /  null genotype resulted in no tumor
formation [Tsikitis et al., 2005]. Furthermore, cyclin D1 appears to
be essential for survival of established tumors. Knocking-down
cyclin D1 by siRNA in rhabdoid tumor cells induced cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in vitro [Alarcon-Vargas et al., 2006]. Interestingly
enough it has been postulated that merlin exerts its tumor sup-
pressor function via repression of PAK-induced cyclin D1 expres-
sion [Xiao et al., 2005]. It is possible then that SMARCB1 and merlin
loss could co-operate in cyclin D1 induction. Small molecular
weight pan-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Flavopyr-
idol were effective at nanomolar concentrations to inhibit rhabdoid
tumor cells in vitro and primary tumor models in vivo [Smith et al.,

2008; Smith et al., 2011]. These studies suggest that targeting cyclin
D1 is an effective strategy to inhibit at least a subset of tumors arising
due to loss of SMARCB1. Whether this strategy would also be
effective for inhibiting schwannoma growth in schwannomatosis
animal models and patients should be investigated.

In addition to regulating the cell cycle, SMARCB1 and the SWI/
SNF components regulate lineage speciﬁc gene expression and
embryonic stem cell programming. SMARCB1 and SWI/SNF
complexes have been shown to be involved in the control of
neurogenesis, myogenesis, adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and hema-
topoiesis [Young et al., 2005; Caramel et al., 2008; Yoo and
Crabtree, 2009; Krosl et al., 2010; Albini and Puri, 2010; Nowak
et al., 2012]. SMARCB1 and SWI/SNF complexes also regulate
embryonic stem cell programming by antagonizing the activity of
polycomb group proteins [Wilson et al., 2010].

Downstream pathways affected by SMARCB1. SWI/SNF com-
plexes are involved in both activation and repression of a selective
subset of genes [Martens and Winston, 2003]. The components of
SWI/SNF complex do not posses sequence-speciﬁc DNA binding
activity and hence are recruited to the promoter region by inter-
action of one of the subunits with gene-speciﬁc transcription factors
[Cairns, 1998; Kingston and Narlikar, 1999; Cairns, 2007; Racki and
Narlikar, 2008]. SMARCB1 appears to be a tethering protein that
recruits SWI/SNF complexes to promoter sites by its interaction
with an activator (for example, MYC) or repressor proteins bound
to the promoter [Cheng et al., 1999; Martens and Winston, 2003].
Several studies that compared the gene expression proﬁle in
rhabdoid cells when SMARCB1 is re-expressed have lead to the
identiﬁcation of a number of downstream pathways that are
directly or indirectly affected by SMARCB1. As described above,
SMARCB1 affects cyclin D1 and p16 and hence regulates p16-cyclin
D1/CDK4-pRb-E2F. SMARCB1 also appears to affect (i) mitotic
spindle checkpoint; (ii) the interferon signaling pathway; and (iii)
the Gli-Hedgehog pathway [Medjkane et al., 2004; Vries et al., 2005;
Morozov et al., 2007; Jagani et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011]. For
example, SMARCB1 and the SWI/SNF complexes are involved in
induction of interferon signaling [Agalioti et al., 2002; Liu et al.,
2002; Pattenden et al., 2002; Cui et al., 2004; Morozov et al., 2007].
Reintroduction of SMARCB1 into SMARCB1 /  MON cells
results in the activation of a statistically signiﬁcant high abundance
of IFN signal induced genes (ISGs) [Morozov et al., 2007].

In addition to inducing the ISGs, SMARCB1 repressed a set of
mitotic genes including PLK1 and Aurora A [Morozov et al., 2007;
Lee et al., 2011]. Aurora A and PLK1 are serine/threonine kinases
that play multiple roles in mitosis. Aurora A is frequently over-
expressed in many cancers and is indicative of poor prognosis
[Nadler et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009]. Aurora A
is an attractive target for developing anti-cancer therapy and, many
Aurora A kinase inhibitors are currently under investigation in
phase I clinical trials [Pollard and Mortimore, 2009; Dar et al., 2010;
Kitzen et al., 2010; Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011; Yan et al.,
2011]. Aurora A is a repressed downstream target of SMARCB1 and
SMARCB1 associates with Aurora A promoter in RT and normal
cells but not in non-RT cells [Lee et al., 2011]. Loss of SMARCB1
leads to aberrant over-expression of Aurora A in mouse and human
tumors and knocking down Aurora A leads to inhibition of
rhabdoid cell growth [Lee et al., 2011]. Targeting expression or

activity of this gene is a novel therapeutic strategy for these tumors.
At this point it is unclear if Aurora A is de-repressed in schwanno-
matosis due to SMARCB1 mutations.

mation or other schwannomatosis-related phenotypes (e.g., pain)
in vivo, a number of groups are developing Smarcb1 conditional
knockout mice to target Schwann cells.

MOUSE MODELS

A number of mice have been generated in which particular proteins
within the SWI/SNF complex have been disrupted. The functional
complexity of the SWI/SNF unit is reﬂected by the distinct pheno-
types observed in mice lacking different subunits. For example, mice
lacking Brm, an ATPase subunit, develop normally but demonstrate
hyperproliferative phenotypes [Reyes et al., 1998]. In contrast, mice
lacking Brg1 (the other SWI/SNF ATPase), Smarcb1 or BAF155 die at
the peri-implantation stage [Klochendler-Yeivin et al., 2000; Roberts
et al., 2000; Guidi et al., 2001; Tsikitis et al., 2005; Bultman et al.,
2008]. In all three of these knockout mice, inner cell mass develop-
ment is altered, and Brg1 and Smarcb1 inactivation also affects the
trophectoderm lineage.

Mice haploinsufﬁcient for SWI/SNF subunits demonstrate a
number of distinct phenotypes. For example, Brg1 heterozygotes
are susceptible to mammary carcinomas without evidence of loss of
heterozygosity [Bultman et al., 2008]. In contrast, Smarcb1 hetero-
zygotes undergo normal development and 5–35% later present with
rhabdoid tumors and other tumor types, many of which are
highly aggressive and metastatic [Klochendler-Yeivin et al., 2000;
Roberts et al., 2000; Guidi et al., 2001; Tsikitis et al., 2005]. Where
examined, tumorigenesis in these mice correlates with loss or
inactivation of the remaining wild-type Smarcb1 allele. Roberts
et al. [2002] generated both an inactivating-conditional Smarcb1
allele and a reversibly inactivating-conditional Smarcb1 allele in
mice. Inhibition of Smarcb1 expression in a variety of adult tissues
resulted in bone marrow failure and rapid death, whereas sporadic
inactivation of Smarcb1 in hematopoietic tissues and in other
organs resulted in rapid onset of lymphomas and rhabdoid tumors.
Neither Brg1 nor Smarcb1 heterozygotes have been reported to
develop schwannomas.

The phenotypes of animals with other conditional mutations of
SWI/SNF subunits demonstrate distinct roles for these proteins that
were not predicted from null or haploinsufﬁcient mice. Matsumoto
et al. [2006], for example, demonstrated that loss of Brg1 in neural
progenitor cell populations results in precocious neuronal differ-
entiation at the expense of glial cell differentiation in the brain and
spinal cord. These effects are linked to a switch in neuron-associated
SWI/SNF subunits [Lessard et al., 2007]. Gresh et al. [2005] specif-
ically inactivated Smarcb1 in the developing liver, resulting in failed
hepatic cell differentiation. Collectively, these mouse studies dem-
onstrate that SWI/SNF factors, including Smarcb1, suppress tumor
formation and are absolutely required for the survival and differ-
entiation of non-malignant cells. These studies also highlight the
diverse functions of SWI/SNF subunits and the need to examine these
proteins using conditional knock-out approaches.

Phenotypic analysis of Smarcb1-deﬁcient Schwann cells is hin-
dered by the fact that homozygous Smarcb1 mutant embryos lack
normal extra-embryonic development and fail at the peri-implan-
tation stage. To circumvent this early embryonic-lethal phenotype,
and to examine whether loss of Smarcb1 in Schwann cells confers a
growth advantage that is sufﬁcient to induce schwannoma for-

One of the promoters used to generate Schwann cell-targeted
disruption of Smarcb1 is the protein zero (P0) gene, one of the
major proteins of peripheral myelin. A 1.1 kb stretch of the 50
ﬂanking sequence of the rat P0 gene is sufﬁcient to direct expression
of heterologous genes to Schwann cells in vivo [Messing et al.,
1992], although expression in neural crest cells has also been
reported [Yamauchi et al., 1999]. This expression follows the
developmental schedule of the endogenous P0 gene showing a
dramatic increase during the ﬁrst week after birth. Moreover,
transgenic mice expressing either SV40 large T-antigen or a nat-
urally occurring mutant Nf2 allele under the rat P0 promoter
develop schwannomas [Messing et al., 1994; Giovannini et al.,
1999]. Therefore, this P0 promoter efﬁciently targets schwannoma
precursor cells. Based on these data, P0-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice are
being generated to direct Cre expression to the schwannoma
precursor cells.

Another strategy to assess the function of Smarcb1 in Schwann
cells is to utilize mouse lines in which gene loss can be induced in
Schwann cells. Mice are therefore being generated in which Smarcb1
disruption is induced using the proteolipid protein gene following
injection of post-natal or adult animals with tamoxifen. This strategy
has been used successfully to disrupt genes in Schwann cells in
embryonic, post-natal and adult mice [Doerﬂinger et al., 2003].
Utilizing both of these strategies will likely result in complementary
mouse models that deﬁne how loss of Smarcb1 in Schwann cells
inﬂuences both developmental and adult phenotypes.

Additional somatic inactivation of NF2 or other genes may play a
role in the development of schwannomas in schwannomatosis
patients. Although Hulsebos et al. [2007] were unable to detect
NF2 gene aberrations in their patients, others found NF2 gene
mutations and loss in a considerable fraction of the investigated
tumors from schwannomatosis patients [Jacoby et al., 1997;
Kaufman et al., 2003; MacCollin et al., 2003; Boyd et al., 2008;
Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Sestini et al., 2008]. Analysis of mice carrying
both conditional mutant Nf2 and Smarcb1 alleles will be critical to
assess how inactivation of Snf5/Nf2 inﬂuences the development of
schwannomatosis-associated phenotypes.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnostic criteria set forth in 2005 [MacCollin et al., 2005]
predated the ability to perform molecular testing for schwanno-
matosis, and also did not take account of the possibility of
multiple meningiomas as a presenting feature. Given current
knowledge of the disorder, we propose the following new criteria
for diagnosis:

Molecular Diagnosis:

* Two or more pathologically proved schwannomas or meningi-
omas AND genetic studies of at least two tumors with loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 22 and two different

PLOTKIN ET AL.

411

NF2 mutations; if there is a common SMARCB1 mutation, this
deﬁnes SMARCB1-associated schwannomatosis

* One pathologically proved schwannoma or meningioma AND

germline SMARCB1 pathogenic mutation

Clinical Diagnosis:

* Two or more non-intradermal schwannomas, one with patho-
logical conﬁrmation, including no bilateral vestibular schwan-
noma by high-quality MRI (detailed study of internal auditory
canal with slices no more than 3 mm thick). Recognize that
some mosaic NF2 patients will be included in this diagnosis at a
young age and that some schwannomatosis patients have been
reported to have unilateral vestibular schwannomas or multiple
meningiomas.

* One pathologically conﬁrmed schwannoma or intracranial men-

ingioma AND affected ﬁrst-degree relative

* Consider as possible diagnosis if there are two or more non-
intradermal
tumors but none has been pathologically
proven to be a schwannoma; the occurrence of chronic pain
in association with the tumor(s) increase the likelihood of
schwannomatosis

Patients with the following characteristics do not fulﬁll diagnosis

for schwannomatosis:

* Germline pathogenic NF2 mutation
* Fulﬁll diagnostic criteria for NF2
* First-degree relative with NF2
* Schwannomas in previous ﬁeld of radiation therapy only

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF SCHWANNOMATOSIS-
ASSOCIATED SCHWANNOMAS

Several studies have documented the presence of hybrid tumors
(benign nerve sheath tumors with characteristic features of both
neuroﬁbromas and schwannomas) in the setting of NF1, NF2, and
schwannomatosis [MacCollin et al., 2005; Harder et al., 2012]. The
presence of abundant myxoid stroma in a schwannoma should alert
the pathologist to the possibility of an association with any of the
neuroﬁbromatoses (as opposed to sporadic schwannoma in a non-
syndromic person). In addition to histological features (hybrid
tumors, myxoid schwannomas), a mosaic pattern of staining for
SMARCB1/INI1 is suggestive of a tumor related to NF2 or schwan-
nomatosis. In an immunohistochemical study of a large cohort of
schwannomas, a mosaic pattern of SMARCB1 expression was noted
in tumors resected from patients with NF2 and familial schwan-
nomatosis (>90% of tumors). In contrast, a mosaic pattern of
expression is unusual (5%) in sporadic, non-syndromic tumors
[Patil et al., 2008]. Thus, the ﬁnding of mosaic SMARCB1 expres-
sion on immunohistochemistry and/or hybrid histology suggests
that a schwannoma may be associated with a form of neuro-
ﬁbromatosis. In these cases, the pathologic ﬁndings may direct
the clinican to refer a patient with a solitary schwannoma for
evaluation of neuroﬁbromatosis.

TUMOR BURDEN IN SCHWANNOMATOSIS

Time and ﬁnancial constraints limit the usefulness of regional MRI
to comprehensively phenotype tumor burden in patients with
schwannomatosis. For this reason, important features of schwan-
nomatosis including whole-body tumor burden and distribution of
schwannomas across body parts are still not well understood. To
better understand the clinical phenotype of schwannomatosis,
teams at Massachusetts General Hospital and University Hospital,
Hamburg, have used whole-body MRI (WBRMI) to assess patients
with schwannomatosis [Plotkin et al., 2012]. This technique
involves the use of a standard MRI scanner with commercially
available software to create a single DICOM image that extends
from head to ankle in most patients. No contrast is required and a
patient can be scanned in about 45 min without the need for
ionizing radiation.

To date, 51 patients with schwannomatosis have been scanned.
The mean age at diagnosis was 42 years; the mean age at the time of
MRI scan was 48.5 years (range: 25–97 years). Fifty-one percent
were male, and 16% had familial disease. WBMRI identiﬁed
internal nerve sheath tumors in 71% of patients, including seven
of eight patients that did not have a history of internal tumors.
Internal tumors were classiﬁed radiologically as either discrete
(locally circumscribed) or plexiform (invasive tumors or those
that involved multiple nerve roots). In patients with tumors on
WBMRI, 29/36 (81%) had only discrete appearing tumors, 3/36
(8%) had only plexiform appearing tumors, and 4/36 (11%) had
both types. For patients with tumors, the median tumor count was 4
(range: 1–27 tumors) and the median whole-body tumor volume
was 39.4 ml (range: 7.0–1371.5 ml). Median volume of plexiform
appearing tumors was smaller in schwannomatosis patients
(32 ml) than in a group of similarly imaged NF1 and NF2 patients,
who had median tumor volumes of 206 and 104 ml, respectively.
The distribution of tumors across body parts was measured using
the distribution coefﬁcient which ranges from 0 (representing
tumor volume that is equally distributed throughout the body)
to 1 (representing tumor volume located in only one body area)
[Plotkin et al., 2012]. In the cohort of schwannomatosis patients,
the median distribution coefﬁcient was 0.9 (range: 0.26–1), indi-
cating that total tumor volume is not distributed evenly across the
body. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the relatively high frequency of
anatomically limited schwannomatosis or the relatively low num-
ber of tumors in most patients.

In order to explore the relationship between tumor burden and
pain, schwannomatosis patients were asked to rate their pain level at
the time of imaging using a visual analog pain scale [scores ranges
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain)]. The median pain score for all
schwannomatosis patients was 1.7. Surprisingly, the median pain
score for patients with familial schwannomatosis was 0.5 whereas the
median score for patients with sporadic schwannomatosis was 2.5.

CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS
Current Treatment Options

Pain medications. Chronic pain is common in patients with
schwannomatosis [Merker et al., 2012]. The etiology of pain in
schwannomatosis is unclear: there is no clear relationship between

412

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A

tumor number, size, location, and the intensity of pain, and the pain
has both neuropathic and nociceptive features. Perhaps for this
reason, there is no widely accepted approach for treating pain in
these patients. Conference attendees supported the use of neuro-
pathic pain medication without favoring a single approach for
schwannomatosis. Reasonable options include calcium channel
alpha 2-delta ligands (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin). In addition,
several medications designated as antidepressants (e.g., amitripty-
line, nortriptyline, duloxetine) can have potent anti-neuropathic
pain effects. Medications used for mood stabilization (e.g., lamo-
trigine, valproate) can also be effective in chronic pain scenarios. It
is not clear whether these drugs directly modulate the pain mech-
anism or treat the depression and anxiety associated with chronic
pain.

Surgical considerations. Surgery is the treatment of choice for
symptomatic schwannomas and, in many patients, can relieve local
pain or symptoms arising from compression of neighboring tissues.
The major risk of surgery is secondary nerve injury and hence,
surgeons experienced with nerve-sparing surgery should be
involved when considering a schwannoma resection. Anecdotal
experience with schwannomatosis patients suggests that surgery
can occasionally result in worsening of the global pain symptom. In
this setting, repeated surgeries appear to offer less beneﬁt in pain
control and may contribute to worsening of the pain syndrome.
This experience has raised the hypothesis that circulating factors
(e.g., cytokines) that are released during surgery can potentiate
painful stimuli. There is clearly a need to better understand surgical
outcomes for patients with schwannomatosis.

Radiation. Experience with radiation therapy for management
of schwannomatosis-related schwannomas is limited. Over the past
two decades, there has been increasing experience with stereotactic
radiation for sporadic vestibular schwannomas and spinal schwan-
nomas [Niranjan et al., 2008; Gerszten et al., 2012]. Early results
suggest that this modality is safe and effective for individuals
without an underlying tumor suppressor syndrome. However,
there is a theoretical risk that radiation exposure could increase
the risk for malignant transformation in patients with schwanno-
matosis, as has been reported for NF1 and NF2 [Evans et al., 2006].
To date, there is no available data on the risk of secondary malignant
transformation of tumors in schwannomatosis patients. At this
time, most experts reserve the use of radiation for patients who
require treatment for growing schwannomas that cannot be treated
with surgery. The role of radiation for symptomatic (i.e., painful)
schwannomas remains unclear.

Chemotherapy options. Currently, there are no approved drugs
for treatment of schwannomas. Since SMARCB1 directly represses
cyclin D1 and since tumors that arise due to loss of SMARCB1 are
dependent on cyclin D1, preclinical studies were conducted to test
the efﬁcacy of drugs that target the cyclin D1/Cdk pathway [Zhang
et al., 2002; Tsikitis et al., 2005]. Flavopiridol is a pan-cdk inhibitor
and it represses cyclin D1 at the transcriptional level [Smith et al.,
2008; Smith et al., 2011]. In preclinical models of primary rhabdoid
tumors that arise due to loss of hSNF5, ﬂavoporidol has shown
efﬁcacy in eliminating tumors. In a mouse model with transgenic
SMARCB1 mutation with biallelic somatic inactivation of NF2,
there is activation of the cyclin D1 and mTOR pathways. Possible
additional molecular drug targets are those deregulated due to loss

of SMARCB1, including mitotic genes, PLK1 and Aurora A that are
upregualted/de-repressed in tumors, and interferon pathway [Lee
et al., 2011]. Hence, the pathways consisting of cyclin D1, PLK1,
Aurora A, p16, and interferons are all possible targets for tumors
harboring SMARCB1 mutations. Finally, in a series of two cases
(personal communication, J Blakeley, S Huson and DG Evans),
the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab has shown some beneﬁt in pain
control and improvement in function in two patients with life-
threatening complications of schwannomatosis. In summary, at
this time, there is no drug therapy that can be recommended for the
treatment of the tumors in schwannomatosis. However, ongoing
preclinical work suggests that early clinical studies (i.e., transla-
tional and dose ﬁnding studies) should be available soon for
schwannomatosis patients.

CONCLUSIONS

There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the
molecular and genetic basis of schwannomatosis since 2007. This
has led to the development of reﬁned diagnostic critera for schwan-
nomatosis. The participants of the workshop identiﬁed priorities
for continued research over the next 5 years. These priorities include
identifying additional genes that predispose to familial and spora-
dic schwannomatosis, understanding the molecular basis for insta-
bility of chromosome 22 in schwannoma formation, characterizing
genotype/phenotype correlations for schwannomatosis/inherited
prediposition to rhabdoid tumors, uncovering the mechanism of
pain in schwannomatosis, and preclinical testing of drugs effecting
in schwannomatosis mouse models. Ultimately, these results
will open the door for clinical trials to treat patients who are not
good candidates for surgery. In the meantime, the International
Schwannomatosis Registry (www.schwannomatosis.org) is pro-
spectively enrolling patients into a database to assist researchers
who wish to identify patients for these clinical investigations.
