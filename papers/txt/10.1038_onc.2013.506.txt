Mutations in the neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy.
Using transcriptome analysis we identiﬁed MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and veriﬁed MAF regulation through
RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human
MPNST. Acute re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in MPNST cells in vitro, decreased
self-renewal of embryonic precursors and transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell death and
reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell
tumor growth in vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF
regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR. MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efﬁcacy due
to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF.

INTRODUCTION
NF1 mutation or loss in humans causes neuroﬁbromatosis type 1
(NF1). NF1 predisposes affected individuals to develop benign
nerve tumors (neuroﬁbromas)
that can transform into life-
threatening malignant
sarcoma (MPNST). NF1 is a tumor
suppressor gene, and biallelic NF1 mutations are characteristic of
MPNST.1 MPNST are a leading cause of death in adult NF1
patients; the lifetime risk of MPNST in NF1 patients is 8–13%,
versus 0.001% in the general population.2 Therapies that are
effective in NF1 patients may be relevant to treating other
diseases, because NF1 mutations are common in sporadic human
cancers, including glioma, neuroblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma.3–6 Furthermore, NF1 mutations
have recently been shown to mediate resistance to therapy, and
understanding how NF1 mutations cause resistance is a goal of
current studies.7,8

NF1 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP); GAPs serve as off
signals for Ras proteins so that patient MPNST cells lacking NF1
have elevated levels of Ras-GTP.9 Loss of neuroﬁbromin alters
growth and differentiation of MPNST cells through increased levels
of Ras-GTP.2,10,11 Current efforts to develop therapies for MPNST are
focused on Ras pathways, although no MPNST therapy has
advanced to clinical practice. Ras signaling in MPNST cells
includes activation of pERK and pAKT and pS6K and p4EBP1,
the mTOR kinase.10–12 MPNST cells
downstream effectors of
transiently slow growth in response to MEK inhibition13 and in
response to compounds which block mTOR signaling.12,14 Efforts to
identify effective drug combinations for MPNST cells are ongoing.15
The idea that cancer cells arise from and/or adopt the self-
renewal and properties of precursor and stem-like cells is

increasingly accepted.16,17 Tumor initiating cells with stem cell
properties are common in MPNST18 and may derive from
peripheral nerve Schwann cell lineage cells or their multipotent
neural crest cell precursors. Nf1 regulates Schwann cell precursor
cell numbers in embryonic dorsal root ganglia.19 Use of cre-drivers
for cell type-speciﬁc Nf1 deletion in Schwann cell precursors
enabled formation of MPNST, consistent with Schwann cell
precursors as one cell of origin for MPNST.20,21 MPNST may
derive from or assume characteristics of neural crest cells as
neural crest gene expression marks MPNST.22,23 Transcriptome
transcription factor
analysis identiﬁed SOX9, a neural crest
required for stem cell survival, as critical
for MPNST cell
survival,24,25 supporting the idea that loss or suppression of
Schwan cell differentiation is characteristic of MPNST. However,
the molecular mechanisms that underlie the failure of MPNST cells
to differentiate into Schwann cell precursors and then Schwann
cells are not known.

MAF (c-MAF)

is a member of the large MAF family, which
includes MafA, MafB and c-Maf.26 MAF transcription factors drive
cell speciﬁcation and differentiation in T cells, the lens and retina,
and sensory neurons.26,27 MAF is a bZip transcription factor of the
AP-1 family. MAF factors homo- or heterodimerize with other
bZip factors or other
to regulate
gene expression.26,28 In cartilage, MAF binds SOX9, regulating
common transcriptional target genes and controlling differentia-
tion.29 MAF is expressed in the developing nervous system of the
chicken, in mature rat peripheral nerve26 and in mouse embryonic
neurons,27 but its expression in developing glia has not been
characterized. MAF can act as an oncogene,26 but can also
counteract Ras-induced transformation.30 One MAF target gene

implicated in cancer is DEPTOR, an mTOR interacting protein that
negatively regulates TORC1 in multiple myeloma cells.31,32

We found that MAF expression is low in NF1 tumors and mouse
Schwann cell precursors and hypothesized that
low MAF
expression contributes to maintenance of a dedifferentiated state
in MPNST tumor cells. We report that elevating MAF expression
in MPNST cells promotes differentiation and increases tumor
growth in xenografts, correlating with a decrease in DEPTOR
and elevated mTOR signaling, and rendering cells sensitive to
mTOR antagonists.

RESULTS
The NF1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD)
normalizes MAF expression
The NF1-GRD accelerates conversion of active Ras-GTP to inactive
Ras-GDP. To deﬁne transcriptional changes downstream of
NF1-GRD expression we conducted gene expression Affymetrix
microarray analysis on triplicate samples of NF1-deﬁcient MPNST
cells (ST88-14 cells) 32 h after infection with NF1-GRD adenovirus
or GFP control adenovirus. At 32 h, GRD expression signiﬁcantly
reduces Ras-GTP and downstream P-MEK and P-ERK,33 while cell
death induced by exogenous high-level expression of NF1-GRD is
not yet present (not shown).

To identify genes with expression dysregulated in MPNST
compared to human Schwann cells (NHSC) and normalized
by the NF1-GRD, we ﬁrst normalized gene expression in MPNST
cells infected with NF1-GRD or control to gene expression in
NHSC. Second, we identiﬁed 152 probe sets with differential
expression X2.3-fold in MPNST cells expressing the NF1-GRD
and not differentially expressed in GFP-expressing cells (Figure 1a).
Third, we identiﬁed 128 of 152 probe sets with gene expression
brought closer to levels in NHSC by NF1-GRD. Finally, we identiﬁed
45 known genes with expression restored to X3-fold levels of
NHSC in MPNST cells infected with NF1-GRD relative to control.
Microarray differential gene expression induced by GRD was
conﬁrmed by RT–PCR analysis for DACH1,24 EGFL5, MAF, PCDH20
and FOXD1; SOX9 and SPRY4 were tested but failed to conﬁrm,
perhaps due to timing of transcriptional regulation.

In a previous study, MAF was in a cluster of genes signiﬁcantly
downregulated in primary tumors and cell
lines derived from
human MPNSTs and mouse MPNST models.13 Conﬁrming these
results, MAF expression was downregulated 24-fold in MPNST cells
infected with control virus relative to NHSC and increased fourfold
in MPNST cells expressing NF1-GRD (Figure 1b). We conﬁrmed that
MAF expression was induced rapidly in MPNST cells after infection
with the NF1-GRD by RT–PCR (Figure 1c). Examination of dermal or
plexiform neuroﬁbroma-derived Schwann cells or MPNST cell
lines, compared with normal human Schwann cells, or dermal and
plexiform neuroﬁbroma or MPNST solid tumors compared with
nerve, underscore the consistently low or absent expression of
MAF (Figures 1d and e).

MAF is regulated by NF1 through a RAS/MAPK/AP-1 pathway
Increased MAPK signaling in MPNST cells is due to loss of NF1 RAS-
Gap function.10,11 Conﬁrming that MAF is downstream of RAS-
RAF-MAPK, MEK inhibitors restored MAF mRNA in MPNST cell lines
and protein expression in S462TY cells
(Figure 2a). AP-1
transcription factors are common effectors of the MAPK pathway34
and MPNST cells have increased AP-1 activity.35 We tested
whether NF1 regulates MAF via AP-1 activity. Transfecting
MPNSTs with the GRD, dominant negative RasN17 or full length
NF1 constructs decreased AP-1 luciferase reporter activity
compared to the empty
vector negative control, while
constitutively active RasV12 activated AP-1 (Figure 2b). Mutant
NF1 constructs lacking the GRD did not repress AP-1 activity,
consistent with AP-1 regulation by RAS signaling (Figure 2b).

The role of MAF in NF1 MPNST
ME Brundage et al

Importantly, a dominant negative aFos36
transfected into
MPNST cell lines along with a MAF promoter luciferase reporter
increased MAF activity,
indicating that AP-1 represses MAF
transcription in MPNST cells (Figure 2c).37 Thus, MAF is a novel
NF1 target in MPNST, repressed by the RAS/MAPK/AP-1 pathway
(Figure 2d).

MAF regulates glial differentiation markers and neural crest
marker SOX9 in MPNST cells
MAF can bind the MPNST biomarker SOX9,29 and MAF is known to
promote tissue speciﬁcation and terminal differentiation in many
cell types.26,27,29,38 We explored whether low MAF expression was
relevant to the failure of MPNST cells differentiation. RT–PCR
revealed upregulation of glial lineage markers S100b, MBP and
BLBP in MPNST cells after transduction with MAF (Figure 3a).
Immunohistochemical staining veriﬁed increased expression of
these proteins in MAF-transduced MPNST cells (Figure 3b).
Because the neural crest marker gene SOX9 has MAF binding
sites in its promoter
(data not shown), we tested whether
restoring MAF expression downregulates SOX9. RT–PCR and
western bot analysis revealed decreased SOX9 mRNA and SOX9
protein when MAF was overexpressed (Figure 3c). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showed MAF occupancy of the
SOX9 promoter (Figure 3d), suggesting that MAF transcriptionally
represses SOX9 in MPNST.

In development, MAF expression correlates with Schwann cell
differentiation status and reduces proliferation of Schwann cell
precursors
To determine if MAF expression is relevant
to normal glial
differentiation, we monitored expression levels in mouse Schwann
cell precursors derived from mouse embryonic E12.5 dorsal root
ganglia and in mature Schwann cells. RT–PCR and immunohisto-
chemical analysis revealed high SOX9 expression in Schwann cell
precursors normalized to Schwann cells (Figure 4a) and low MAF
expression in Schwann cell precursors compared to Schwann cells
(Figure 4b). Confocal
imaging showed that MAF is present in
Schwann cell cytoplasm and nuclei (Figure 4b). To determine if low
MAF expression contributes to the precursor state, we transduced
mouse Schwann cell precursors at clonal density with lenti-MAF. We
observed a decrease in Schwann cell precursor self-renewal, which
was maintained for up to three serial replatings (Figure 4c). The
reciprocal expression pattern of SOX9 and MAF compared to mature
Schwann cells, together with MAF’s ability to decrease precursor
self-renewal, is consistent with the idea that low MAF expression in
SC precursors sustains them in a progenitor state (Figure 4d).

Acute overexpression of MAF in MPNST cells transiently increases
cell death and reduces anchorage-independent growth, while
sustained lower MAF expressing cells proliferate and maintain
increased TORC1 signaling through DEPTOR
If MAF promotes cell differentiation, then restoring MAF expres-
sion in MPNST cells might affect tumorigenic potential. S462-TY
cells transduced with MAF for 48 h signiﬁcantly decreased
metabolic activity as measured by MTS assay (Figure 5a). Flow
cytometric analysis of PI and Annexin stained S462-TY cells
transduced with MAF for 48 h revealed increased apoptotic cell
death (Figure 5b).
Importantly, these cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects were accompanied by decreased anchorage-independent
in S462-TY cells overexpressing MAF
growth in soft agar
constitutively or
these
transient effects, MAF expressing cells were able to proliferate in
culture, as conﬁrmed by increased metabolic activity in MTS
assays (Figure 5d) and BrdU incorporation (Figure 5e). Relative
levels of MAF protein expression were higher 2 days after
induction than at day 6, correlating with increased apoptosis
evidenced by cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 5f). Low MAF levels by day

expression on MPNST cells are dose dependent.

showed increased phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 and decreased
phosphorylation of AKT (Figure 6c), readouts of TORC1 activity and
its negative feedback onto AKT.39 Overexpression of MAF did not
change levels of pERK, consistent with MAF acting downstream of
MAPK signaling.
Importantly, overexpression of MAF, plus
simultaneous DEPTOR overexpression, attenuated DEPTOR levels
and pS6 (Figure 6d), and DEPTOR blocked MAF-induced decreased
cell survival in MTS assay (Figure 6e). These data suggest that MAF
regulates AKT/mTOR signaling through DEPTOR.

MAF enhances tumor growth in a xenograft model and enhances
response to RAD001
To test whether MAF-induced increased TORC1 activity affects
tumorigenesis in vivo, we injected BALB/cnu/nu mice with S462-TY

cells transduced with doxycycline-inducible MAF or vector-control
lentivirus. Tumors overexpressing MAF were larger than vector
control tumors (Figure 7a), consistent with MAF regulating an
escape mechanism, conferring a survival advantage. IHC analysis
of tumor xenografts conﬁrmed crosstalk to the mTOR pathway
seen in vitro. P-S6 increased and DEPTOR decreased in MAF
expressing tumors (Figure 7b). Levels of pS6 and DEPTOR varied
throughout the tumors and were most pronounced in regions of
densely packed growing tumor cells.

Since MAF regulated changes in DEPTOR affected TORC1
signaling, we reasoned that overexpressing MAF might enhance
sensitivity to mTOR pathway inhibition. Normally, S462TY cells are
poorly responsive to RAD001. However,
the combination of
treatment with 10 or 30 nM RAD001 in addition to MAF
overexpression resulted in an enhanced response (Figure 7c).

caspase 3) is transient and correlates with high levels of MAF expression.

In xenograft models, the S462TY cells are also not signiﬁcantly
responsive to treatment with 10 mg/kg RAD001 (Figure 7d), but a
signiﬁcant decrease in tumor volume compared to the vector
control tumors was seen in combination with MAF overexpression
(Figure 7e). IHC analysis conﬁrmed a decrease in pS6 staining due
to RAD001 inhibition of TORC1 activity in vector control and MAF-
expressing tumors
(Figure 7f). Treatment with PD0325901
increased MAF expression (Figures 2a and 8a), decreased DEPTOR,
increased pS6 and p4E-BP1 and decreased P-AKT (Figure 8a). The
combination of PD0325901 with RAD001 abolished changes in
pS6 and p4E-BP1 (Figure 8a). PD0325901 decreased mRNA and
protein encoding the neural crest marker SOX9 (Figures 8a and b)
and increased mRNA encoding Schwann cell differentiation
markers BLBP/FABP7, S100b and MBP; RAD001 had no signiﬁcant
effects on cell differentiation. S462TY cells are resistant to RAD001
in MTS assays (Figure 8c), but responded to PD0325901 at 1 mM.13
Combinations of these inhibitors had additive effects on cell
viability (Figure 8c). S462-TY cells xenografted into immune-

DISCUSSION
We identiﬁed 45 genes, including MAF, as aberrantly expressed in
MPNST cells and normalized by expressing the NF1-GRD. We

conﬁrmed that MAF expression is low in MPNST cells and tumors,
and that MAF expression is acutely regulated by NF1 through Ras/
MAPK/AP1 signaling. High levels of MAF increased expression of
Schwann cell differentiation markers in MPNST cells and killed
MPNST cells in vitro, but lower levels of MAF expression were
tolerated and correlated with enhanced growth in tumor
xenografts. MAF re-expression in the setting of NF1 tumorigenesis
resulted in elevation of mTOR signaling and concomitant decrease
in DEPTOR, a negative regulator of the AKT/mTOR pathway.31 We
conclude that MAF controls crosstalk between the MAPK and
mTOR pathways in MPNST cells, helping to explain how NF1 loss
confers resistance to therapies.
In addition to these ﬁndings
relevant to tumorigenesis our data support the idea that NF1 and
MAF control self-renewal
in Schwann cell precursors. The data
suggest that MAF expression regulates cell phenotypes in a
context-dependent manner: MAF blocked Schwann cell precursor
self-renewal,
and
paradoxically promoted tumorigenesis.

Our data identify MAF as an NF1-regulated target gene
downstream of
the RAS effector pathway RAS/MAPK/AP-1
(Figure 9a). To our knowledge, MAF is the ﬁrst cancer-relevant
NF1 target identiﬁed. There is previous evidence supporting the
regulation of AP-1 activity by NF1 through a MAPK pathway in the
ST88-14 MPNST cell line,35 and MAF was previously reported to be
regulated by a MEK-ERK-FOS pathway in myeloma cell lines.40 This
suggests that NF1 regulation of MAF may be relevant to other cell
types and other cancers.

normal human Schwann cells,24 and that SOX9 is elevated.41 MAF
expression is also reduced in prostate cancer.42 We found that
levels of MAF are very low in all tested MPNST cell lines, including
sporadic MPNST cells,24 possibly accounting for the fact that siRNA
targeting NF1 in a sporadic (non-NF1 mutant) MPNST cell line did
not alter MAF expression.41 Our ﬁnding that
the NF1-GRD
regulates MAF expression implies that activation of one or more
Ras proteins suppresses MAF. In NF1 MPNST cells, MAF was not
normalized by NRAS siRNA;41 other Ras proteins (e.g., K-or H-Ras)
may regulate MAF expression.

MAF expression suppressed expression of the neural crest
marker SOX9 (Figures 3a–c and 7a). Consistent with over-
expression of MAF transiently lowering SOX9 expression and
resulting in cell death, knockdown of SOX9 killed MPNST cells.24
As MAF binds the SOX9 promoter, the effect on SOX9 is most likely

direct. It is possible that MAF competes with SOX9 for binding
sites and/or that MAF partners with SOX9 to regulate transcription,
as in cartilage.29 MAF also upregulated expression of glial
differentiation markers BLBP, MBP and S100b;
it remains to be
determined whether

Downregulation of MAF and Schwann cell differentiation
markers is characteristic of, and thus likely relevant to, both
sporadic and NF1 MPNST; notably, both cell
types exhibit
activation of the MAPK pathway.43

these effects are direct or

Our studies support a role for MAF in suppressing Schwann cell
precursor self-renewal. It will be essential to conﬁrm this MAF role
by loss of function in vivo. Roles for MAF in tissue speciﬁcation and
cell differentiation are also supported by studies in T cells, lens,
retina and endochondral bone. For example, MAF maintains cell
quiescence in the lens.26 MAF showed a pro-differentiation role in

MPNST cells and reduced anchorage-independent growth in
MPNST cell lines expressing MAF (Figure 7a), suggesting that MAF
can act as a tumor suppressor in MPNST. A tumor suppressive role
for MAF is supported by ﬁndings that MafA counteracts the
transforming properties of oncogenic RasV12 and B-Raf /MEK in
neuroretina cells.30 MAF may have tumor suppressive roles
through regulating p53-dependent cell death, inhibition of MYB
and/or induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p27.26

However,

low levels of MAF expression correlated with
proliferation in vitro and increased tumor growth in vivo, implying
that MAF can act as an oncogene in the context of NF1 loss. MAF
can transform ﬁbroblasts, is activated by translocation in multiple
myeloma and is overexpressed in angioimmunoblastic T-cell
lymphomas.26 The difference between acute MAF expression
in vitro and our in vivo studies may be explained by levels of MAF
expression: high MAF expressing cells die and are survived by cells
expressing lower levels of MAF with sustained expression of pS6.
Possibly, MAF interacts with different partner transcription factors
depending on expression level, altering target gene expression.
For example,
the MAF target gene
integrinb7 allowed myeloma cancer cells
to adhere more
efﬁciently to bone marrow stroma cells, mediating adaptation to
the tumor microenvironment.26

increased expression of

caused by overexpressing MAF in MPNST xenografts, as the
ineffectiveness of RAD001 treatment alone in S462TY MPNST cells
was reversed when combined with MAF expression (Figure 6f).

Due to NF1 loss in MPNST, Ras-GTP is activated and inhibition of
MAPK and mTOR pathways have been evaluated in MPNST
preclinical studies;2,12–14,43–45 as single agents, no tested inhibitor
caused tumor regression, revealing the need for combinatorial
approaches in MPNST. Our ﬁnding that MAF expression and
downstream effects are regulated by MAPK signaling in MPNST
(Figures 2a and 8a, b) and in multiple myeloma40 and that MAF
expression enhances responses to Rapalogs (Figures 7c,e,f and 8c)
provides further rationale for dual inhibition of the MAPK and AKT/
mTOR pathways.7 Our results are consistent with a study in which
DEPTOR accumulated in breast cancer cells on knockdown of its
ubiquitin ligase, resulting in resistance to rapamycin and high
pAKT in vitro.46 Examining PD0325901-treated xenografts revealed
that less responsive tumors showed MAF positivity, suggesting
that resistance may be in part due to the effects of MAF-related
crosstalk (Figure 8d).

Crosstalk between the MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways is
increasingly well documented. MEK inhibitors induce epidermal
growth factor-induced AKT activation, ERK phosphorylates TSC2
and RAPTOR to promote TORC1 activity, and AKT can phosphor-
ylate Raf at inhibitory sites that negatively regulate MEK activity.39
Further, drug studies in breast, melanoma and colon cancer
patient samples and a mouse model of prostate cancer showed
MAPK activation after RAD001 treatment
through a PI3K-
dependent feedback loop.47 The reliance on both pathways in
many cancer types, including NF1-deﬁcient AML cell lines, which
became cytarabine sensitive when the GRD was restored or MEK

MAF regulates DEPTOR and represses mTOR signaling in
multiple myeloma.31 We demonstrated that MAF also regulates
DEPTOR, but in MPNST cells MAF expression increases TORC1
activity (Figure 7b). The AKT/mTOR pathway is activated in some
MPNSTs, and enhanced activation of the pathway correlated with
malignant progression.43 In MPNST cells, the pro-survival effects
of TORC139 are likely to explain the tumor promoting effect

Figure 9. NF1-mediated control of Ras-MAPK signaling: cross-talk with mTOR signaling through DEPTOR. (a) In the absence of NF1, MAF
expression is suppressed through a RAS/MAPK/AP-1 pathway. The transient effects of high MAF re-expression include an increase in cell death
and decreases in SOX9, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. (b) MAF also regulates DEPTOR, which negatively regulates TORC1
activity. TORC1 activity can be read-out by the activity of its substrates, such as the phosphorylation of S6 by S6K. In turn, S6K activity causes
negative feedback resulting in the decreased phosphorylation of AKT. Our studies suggest that sustained lower levels of MAF expression
in vivo increase TORC1 activity and enhance tumor growth. This enhanced TORC1 signaling renders tumors vulnerable to TORC1 inhibition
with RAD001.

or mTOR inhibitors were used,48 underscores the need for
combinatorial therapeutic approaches.

In summary, we identiﬁed crosstalk between the MAPK and
AKT/mTOR pathways through MAF and DEPTOR in NF1 mutant
cells (Figure 9b). Strategies to upregulate MAF and/or down-
regulate DEPTOR in NF1 mutant cells, including MEK inhibition,
may enhance response to well-tolerated rapalogs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray analyses
Collection of samples, RNA isolation, probe generation, Affymetrix HU133
Plus 2.0 microarray hybridization and data normalization were described.24
To compare MPNST cells infected with adenovirus, we normalized gene
expression to average expression in three independent NHSC samples.

Statistical analyses (analysis of variance; FDR¼ 0.001)
identiﬁed gene
expression changes between uninfected MPNST cells, MPNST cells infected
with control (GFP) virus and MPNST cells infected with NF1-GRD virus as
described.33

Cell culture
Normal human Schwann cells (NHSC) from trauma victims and MPNST cell
lines were cultured as described.24 For cells transduced with doxycycline
inducible lentivirus, we used certiﬁed Tet-free FBS (Thermo Scientiﬁc
Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA).

Viral infection
For microarray analysis, MPNST cells were infected with puriﬁed Ad-NF1-
GRD or control Ad-GFP,
in triplicate, for 2 h in serum-free medium at
200 pfu per cell. Viruses were removed and cells cultured in normal

medium for 30 h, then the RNA was isolated for analysis of gene expression
by RT—PCR analysis as described.24

MPNST cells were transduced with lentiviral particles at 70–90%
conﬂuence. Constitutive expression used mCherry tagged MAF (EX-
Y2046-Lv111, GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA) and mCherry control
lentivirus. Inducible expression used lentiviral vectors containing the MAF
ORF or empty pLVX-Tight-Puro vector (GeneCopoeia) in a modiﬁed pTight
backbone (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) with pLVX-Tet-On
doxycycline inducible vector
(Clonetech). CCHMC Viral Vector Core
produced virus with 4-plasmid packaging http://www.cincinnatichildren-
s.org/research/div/exphematology/translational/vpf/vvc/default.htm. Lenti-
viral particles were incubated with MPNST cells (MOI of 10) in 8 mg/ml
polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h followed by selection
in 2 mg/ml puromycin, which killed uninfected cells within 3 days.

Luciferase reporter assays
MPNST cells (5 104/ well) in 96-well plates were serum starved (0.1% FBS)
overnight. Cells were transfected using FuGENE HD (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN, USA) with 100 ng per well of an AP-1 luciferase (Stratagene, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) reporter vector, 5 ng of a renilla luciferase reference control and
50 ng of plasmid DNA expressing full
length NF1, N-term and C-term
constructs lacking the GRD (gifts of Frank McCormick), RasN17, RasV12,
aFos and empty control.49 Cells were stimulated in 10% FBS for 24 h and
lysed for luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The MAF reporter
was described.37

Real time-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen,
Germantown, MD, USA) and used as a template for cDNA synthesis (ABI
High capacity archive kit) and RT–PCR (ABI 7500 Sequence Detection

Immunocytochemistry
Cultured cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 and
blocked with 10% normal serum for 1 h at room temperature.19 Primary
antibodies used were S100b (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), MBP
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and BLBP (Millipore). Secondary
incubations used host-appropriate TRITC conjugated antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI
(Sigma-Aldrich) and microscopic images acquired with ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M. Tumor parafﬁn sections
stained for MAF (Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA), pS6, pERK (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), and DEPTOR (Novus, Saint Charles, MO, USA) were
visualized with DAB.

Immunoblot
Cell lysates were created and western blotting conducted as described,24
blocking without detergent. Membranes were probed with antibodies for
MAF (Imgenex), SOX9 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), S100b (Dako), MBP
(Chemicon), BLBP (Millipore), DEPTOR (Novus), cleaved-caspase 3, pS6, S6,
p4E-BP1, 4E-BP1, p473AKT, AKT and b-ACTIN (Cell Signaling) as a loading
control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad,
Hercules, CA, USA) were used with ECL Plus developing system (GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
MPNST 88-14 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min on
ice. Glycine was added to 0.125 M. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation

Cells were lysed 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA,
1 Complete inhibitor. A Bioruptor generated soluble chromatin
(Cosmo Bio USA, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with DNA fragment sizes of
200–800 bp. We precleared cell lysates with protein A/G-Sepharose beads
(Santa Cruz). Anti-MAF (Imgenex) and control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz)
immunoprecipitated chromatin-protein complexes and cross-linking
reversed with 0.3 M NaCl at 65 1C for 12 h. RNaseA and proteinase K were
added for 1 h at 37 1C. We puriﬁed DNA fragments with the QIAquick PCR
puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen). Input chromatin was used as a positive control in
RT–PCR with the primers: GPH1005991(-)01A for MAF binding sites on
SOX9 promoter and GPH100001C(-)01A for a chromosome 12 promoter
desert as a negative control (SABiosciences).

Sphere progenitor and Schwann cell culture
DRG from E12.5–13.5 embryos were dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin
(Mediatech, Herndon, VA, USA) for 20 min at 37 1C; single-cell suspensions
were obtained with a narrow-bore pipette and 40 mm strainer (BD-Falcon,
San Jose, CA, USA). Live cells (500 per well) in 24-well plates in sphere
medium were counted after 7 days as described.19 To passage, spheres
were pelleted, treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 3 min, dissociated and
plated at clonal density. Schwann cells were derived from DRG single cell
suspensions as described.19

MTS assay. Transduced MPNST cells (500 cells per well) were seeded in
triplicate and incubated overnight in 96-well plates in the presence or
absence of puromycin (2 mg/ml). Doxycycline, RAD001 and PD0325901 or
selection media were added the next day and subsequently daily.
Absorbance was read on day 4 post-infection or doxycycline induction
using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega).

Flow cytometry
Approximately 100 000 MPNST cells transduced with MAF or vector control
were induced with doxycycline for 24 h and ﬁxed in 0.5% paraformalde-
hyde. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and annexin according to
Apoptosis kit instructions (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Flow
cytometry was performed on a FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo software.

Soft agar
Agar (6% in DMEM, 10% FBS) was plated in 35 mm dishes. 5 103 MPNST
cells were mixed with 3.6% agar and overlaid on solidiﬁed agar. Cells were
cultured at 37 1C in 7.5% CO2 in puromycin or doxycycline. Colonies were
counted after 10 days. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Mouse xenograft
Mouse xenografts of NF1 patient-derived MPNST cells were conducted
as described.13 1.5 106 MPNST S462-TY cells suspended in Matrigel (BD)
and expressing pLVX control
injected
subcutaneously into the right ﬂanks of 6–8-week-old female athymic
