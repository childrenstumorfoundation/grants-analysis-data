Abstract
We recently reported SMARCE1 mutations as a cause of spinal clear cell meningiomas. Here, we have identified
five further cases with non-NF2 spinal meningiomas and six with non-NF2 cranial meningiomas. Three of the
spinal cases and three of the cranial cases were clear cell tumours. We screened them for SMARCE1mutations and
investigated copy number changes in all point mutation-negative samples. We identified two novel mutations
in individuals with spinal clear cell meningiomas and three mutations in individuals with cranial clear cell
meningiomas. Copy number analysis identified a large deletion of the 5′ end of SMARCE1 in two unrelated
probands with spinal clear cell meningiomas. Testing of affected and unaffected relatives of one of these individuals
identified the same deletion in two affected female siblings and their unaffected father, providing further evidence
of incomplete penetrance of meningioma disease in males. In addition, we found loss of SMARCE1 protein in three
of 10 paraffin-embedded cranial clear cell meningiomas. Together, these results demonstrate that loss of SMARCE1
is relevant to cranial as well as spinal meningiomas. Our study broadens the spectrum of mutations in the SMARCE1
gene and expands the phenotype to include cranial clear cell meningiomas.

Introduction

Germline NF2 mutations predispose individuals to
meningiomas in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) dis-
ease [1]. Somatic NF2 mutations are also detectable in
up to 60% of sporadic meningiomas [2,3]. Germline
schwannomatosis-associated SMARCB1 mutations con-
fer a lower risk (∼5%) and are rarely found in sporadic
[4] or multiple [5] meningiomas.

We recently described SMARCE1 mutations in spinal
clear cell meningioma disease [6]. The phenotype of this
novel syndrome is distinct from meningiomas caused by
mutation of the NF2 or SMARCB1 genes.

SMARCE1, SMARCB1 and SUFU have all been
implicated in meningioma disease [6–8] and are all
Sonic Hedgehog–Gli pathway protein, Gli1 interactors
[9]. Two large studies, defining somatic mutations in
meningiomas, identified a role for the hedgehog–Gli
pathway gene, SMO, and the mTor pathway gene, Akt1
[10,11].

Mutations in different meningioma genes seem to lead
to differences in tumour subtype. SMARCB1-associated
meningiomas occur predominantly at the falx cerebri
[8], while NF2-associated meningiomas are more likely
to be located in the lateral and posterior skull base [10].
Acquired non-NF2 mutations tend to result in tumours

located more medially than tumours with NF2 muta-
tions. NF2 mutations are also more likely to be found in
fibroblastic and transitional histological subtypes, while
meningothelial meningiomas tend to have SMO or Akt1
mutations [11].

The SMARCE1 mutations identified previously were
present only in spinal clear cell meningiomas [6],
although it was unclear whether the phenotype is spe-
cific to location or the histological subtype, since none
of the cranial meningiomas examined were clear cell.
The ability to genetically categorize meningiomas more
specifically would be useful for determining a more
specific prognosis. Therefore, we investigated further
cases of spinal and cranial meningiomas for SMARCE1
mutations to characterize the phenotype further.

Materials and methods

Patient material
Paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and genomic DNA
from lymphocytes or tumours were obtained from a
retrospectively collected historical archive. Ethical
approval was obtained from the North West 7–Greater
Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee
(Reference No. 10/H1008/74).

Sanger sequencing
SMARCE1 exons were amplified from genomic DNA
samples. Sequencing PCR was performed using a
BigDye® Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI,
Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and analysed on a
3730xl DNA Analyser (ABI).

SMARCE1 copy number analysis
The genomic sequence of the human SMARCE1 gene
was downloaded from the USCS genome browser
(www.genome.ucsc.edu). Seven SMARCE1 MLPA
probes were designed according to criteria provided by
MRC-Holland (The Netherlands) at www.mlpa.com
(Figure 2A). The exon 5-specific MLPA probe was
designed to overlap the known alteration, c.237 + 2T>C.
Six reference probes
targeting physically distinct
genomic regions were derived from previously estab-
lished probe sets [12]. Oligonucleotides for MLPA
probes were from MWG Eurofins (Ebersberg, Ger-
many). MLPA reagents were from MRC-Holland.
Products were visualized on a LICOR4200 (LICOR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Relative MLPA
signals were calculated as described previously [13].

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded meningiomas were immunostained
for SMARCE1 protein. Briefly, 4 μm paraffin sections
were dried for 4 h at 37 ∘C, followed by 1 h at 60 ∘C. The
sections were then stained with 1:100 anti-SMARCE1
HPA003916 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,

USA), using an indirect peroxidase method on the Roche
Ultra IHC autostainer. The cells were counterstained
with haematoxylin II and blueing reagent. The sections
were then dehydrated with 100% methylated spirits and
cleared with xylene before adding Pertex mountant.

Results and discussion

We screened five individuals with spinal meningiomas
and six individuals with cranial meningiomas for point
mutations in the SMARCE1 gene (Table 1). Three
individuals with spinal meningiomas and three indi-
viduals with cranial meningiomas were known to have
clear cell tumours. Two novel point mutations were
identified in individuals with spinal meningiomas.
A heterozygous frameshift mutation, c.275_276insA,
p.(Leu93Valfs*17), was identified in a boy who had
developed a spinal clear cell meningioma at 2 years
of age. Sequencing of his tumour DNA indicated
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as the second, somatic
mutation. A frameshift mutation, c.624_627delTGAG,
p.(Ser208Argfs*26), was identified, in conjunction with
LOH, in the tumour of another individual with a clear
cell meningioma. No point mutations were found in
the three remaining spinal cases, including one clear
cell case.

A

germline

inversion,

c.374_395inv22,

p.(Glu125_Alal32delinsGlyLeuHisArgPhelleValLeu),
was identified in one individual with a cranial clear
cell meningioma and a second, somatic point muta-
tion c.267delT, p.(Asp90Thrfs*2) was identified in a
matched tumour. Two other cranial clear cell menin-
giomas carried the nonsense mutation, c.357C > G,
p.(Tyr119*), and the nonsense mutation, c.688C > T,
p.(Gln230*), respectively. For both of these mutations,
LOH was indicated as the second hit; however, no lym-
phocyte DNA was available to confirm the mutations
in the germline. No mutations were seen in the three
remaining individuals.

Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue from four
of five mutation-positive meningiomas, and the point
mutation-negative spinal meningioma showed loss
of SMARCE1 protein in all tumours (Figure 1A–E).
To determine whether loss of protein in the point
mutation-negative tumour could be due to a larger muta-
tion, we developed a copy number assay (Figure 2A)
for SMARCE1. Negative control samples were nor-
mal and an exon 5 mutation-positive control showed
a reduced signal
in exon 5 (Figure 2B). The point
mutation-negative tumour DNA showed signal reduc-
tion, indicating the presence of a heterozygous deletion
which removes the 5′ half of SMARCE1 on one allele
in conjunction with a whole gene deletion on the other
allele (Figure 2C).

Due to this result, we analysed 10 additional
be
samples,

with SMARCE1 loss was from a patient with a clin-
ical diagnosis of NF2, with multiple schwannomas
and meningiomas but no germline NF2 mutation. No
SMARCE1 mutation was identified in germline DNA,
indicating that the observed protein loss in tumour is
probably due to a somatic mutation, although analysis
of tumour DNA was not possible. No other tumours
from this patient were available for analysis. The two
remaining SMARCE1 protein-negative meningiomas
were single tumours and no DNA was available for
mutation testing.

Overall, we identified seven novel SMARCE1 muta-
tions in clear cell meningioma patients, three of which
were confirmed in the germline (Table 1). Four of these
were identified in individuals with spinal menigniomas.
However, the other three individuals had cranial menin-
giomas.

One of three female siblings with spinal clear cell
meningiomas, who inherited a large deletion from their
unaffected father, also developed a cranial meningioma.
An unrelated female developed a cranial meningioma
at the age of 14 years. Her mother is now also known
to have asymptomatic cranial meningiomas on MRI
scan. The proband’s brother also carries the mutation,
although he remains clinically unaffected at 17 years of
age. One mutation was found in the cranial tumour of
a 10 year-old boy with an affected uncle, presumed to
have NF2 disease, although no germline NF2 mutation
was identified. No lymphocyte DNA was available for
SMARCE1 analysis; therefore the germline status of this
mutation remains uncertain.

All SMARCE1 mutation-positive males in this study
developed tumours between the ages of 2 and 10 years,
with the exception of the two clinically unaffected

males, who remain free of symptoms at 17 and 70 years
of age, respectively (Table 1). The mutation-positive
females developed tumours between ages 14 and 30
years. This supports our previous observation that there
is incomplete penetrance of meningioma disease in
males, but that those who do develop menigiomas tend
to develop them at an earlier age than females. The rea-
son for this is still unclear, but may reflect a hormonal
stimulus to meningioma growth. In summary, we have
shown that SMARCE1 protein loss occurs in cranial as
well as spinal meningiomas, demonstrating that it is the
histological subtype, rather than tumour location, that is
determined by SMARCE1 mutations.

Mutation identification can be used to define risks in
relatives and improve classification of risk categories in
terms of likely location and histology of meningiomas.
Clear cell meningiomas are classed as grade II, due to an
apparent high recurrence rate, in comparison to grade I
tumours. However, natural history studies are required
to define definitive recurrence risks so that appropriate
surveillance schedules can be established. Initial data
in our small series of SMARCE1-positive cases indicate
that the recurrence risk for these tumours is low. It
is also uncertain whether clear cell meningiomas with
somatic SMARCE1 loss occurring in the context of
NF2 follow a different natural history to those due to
germline SMARCE1 mutations. Further work is required
to delineate the mechanism of SMARCE1-associated
meningioma development.
