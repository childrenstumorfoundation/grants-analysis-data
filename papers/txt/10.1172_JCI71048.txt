The prevalence of brain tumors in males is common but unexplained. While sex differences in disease are typically mediated 
through acute sex hormone actions, sex-specific differences in brain tumor rates are comparable at all ages, suggesting 
that factors other than sex hormones underlie this discrepancy. We found that mesenchymal glioblastoma (Mes-GBM) 
affects more males as the result of cell-intrinsic sexual dimorphism in astrocyte transformation. We used astrocytes from 
neurofibromin-deficient (Nf1–/–) mice expressing a dominant-negative form of the tumor suppressor p53 (DNp53) and 
treated them with EGF as a Mes-GBM model. Male Mes-GBM astrocytes exhibited greater growth and colony formation 
compared with female Mes-GBM astrocytes. Moreover, male Mes-GBM astrocytes underwent greater tumorigenesis in vivo, 
regardless of recipient mouse sex. Male Mes-GBM astrocytes exhibited greater inactivation of the tumor suppressor RB, 
higher proliferation rates, and greater induction of a clonogenic, stem-like cell population compared with female Mes-GBM 
astrocytes. Furthermore, complete inactivation of RB and p53 in Mes-GBM astrocytes resulted in equivalent male and female 
tumorigenic transformation, indicating that intrinsic differences in RB activation are responsible for the predominance 
of tumorigenic transformation in male astrocytes. Together, these results indicate that cell-intrinsic sex differences in RB 
regulation and stem-like cell function may underlie the predominance of GBM in males.

Introduction
Throughout life, there are sex-specific differences in the prevalence 
of multiple human diseases. Many of these disparities, such as the 
rise in autoimmune diseases in women during their reproductive 
years or the increase in cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal 
women, can be related to differences in sex hormone abundance 
(1). However, not all sex disparity in human disease correlates with 
the dynamics of circulating sex hormones. Regardless of age, brain 
cancers  are  more  common  in  males  than  in  females  (2).  In  fact, 
multiple brain tumor types in children exhibit marked sex dispar-
ity. For example, group 3 and group 4 medulloblastomas occur in 
nearly twice as many boys as girls (3, 4). These tumors occur with 
peak incidences in young (<5-year-old) and peripubertal children, 
respectively. Thus, while the hormonal milieu of young and peri-
pubertal children is significantly different, there is a potent effect 
of  sex  on  tumorigenesis  in  both  age  groups.  These  observations 
suggest that the sex disparity in medulloblastoma cannot be simply 
ascribed to the effects of circulating sex hormones. Therefore, an 
examination of alternate mechanisms through which sex can influ-
ence brain tumorigenesis is warranted.

Glioblastoma  (GBM),  the  most  common  malignant  brain 
tumor in adults, also exhibits a greater prevalence in men (5). 
Despite  enormous  breakthroughs  in  basic  cancer  research, 
outcome  from  GBM  remains  dismal.  For  those  treated  with

surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, overall survival remains 
approximately  14  months  (6).  In  addition  to  more  frequently 
developing GBM, males also have a lower 5-year survival rate 
compared with that of females with GBM and other malignant 
CNS tumors (7). Understanding how sex affects GBM biology 
could  elucidate  mechanisms  relevant  to  both  its  genesis  and 
response  to  treatment.  In  the  current  study,  we  investigated 
whether  the  effect  of  sex  in  GBM  involves  cell-intrinsic  sex-
ual  dimorphism  in  tumor  progenitors.  Identification  of  such 
cell-intrinsic mechanisms has broad implications for all of can-
cer biology and cancer care.

Results
Male  predominance  in  GBM  is  subtype  specific.  Based  on  their 
gene  expression  profiles,  GBMs  can  be  divided  into  classical, 
mesenchymal, neural, and proneural subtypes (8). The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set, as originally reported by Ver-
haak et al. (8), indicates that mesenchymal and neural subtypes 
of GBM occur in at least twice as many men as women (Table 1).  
To  determine  whether  similar  sex  differences  are  evident  in 
other  large  GBM  data  sets,  we  developed  methods  for  sex 
assignment based on the genetic signature of the sex chromo-
somes that could be applied to publically accessible gene expres-
sion profiling data, which frequently have incomplete or no sex 
information  on  the  samples  (Supplemental  Figure  1;  supple-
mental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI71048DS1). We examined 2 additional data sets (GSE16011, 
ref. 9, and GSE13041, ref. 10) containing 426 GBM specimens.

AMale fraction equals the ratio of male cases to total cases within each 
subtype, and the 95% CI was calculated based on the Agresti-Coull 
method. BP values were calculated from 2-sided exact binomial test (H0: P = 
0.5 vs. Ha: P ≠ 0.5). CSubtype assignment for subjects in these cohorts was 
based on k-nearest neighbor method (k = 9) using TCGA prototype data. 
We have varied k in the range of 8~20, and the results are similar.

Molecular subtypes were assigned using the k-nearest neighbor 
method (with consideration of varying k) based on the prototype 
data (8), and missing sex was inferred based on the genetic sig-
nature of sex chromosomes. We found that mesenchymal GBM 
(Mes-GBM) exhibited significant sex disparity in both data sets, 
with the overall rate of affected men greater than twice that of 
women. Also evident was a trend toward significantly different 
rates in both the neural and proneural subsets, but this was not 
evident in the classical GBM. These data suggest that the effect 
of sex in GBM is dependent on molecular subtype.

Sex-specific models of gliomagenesis. Mes-GBM frequently exhib-
its loss of neurofibromin (NF1) and TP53 function (8). Moreover, in 
mouse models of disease, combined loss of Nf1 and p53 is sufficient 
for gliomagenesis (11), but with a male predominance (12). Thus, 
in both mice and humans, sex interacts with loss of NF1 and TP53 
as a determinant of glioma, but the molecular basis for this effect 
of sex remains unexplained. To investigate whether the effect of 
sex  on  gliomagenesis  is  independent  of  the  acute  actions  of  sex 
hormones, we established male and female astrocyte cultures and 
examined their behavior upon stepwise loss of Nf1 and p53.

Male  and  female  astrocytes  were  isolated  from  the  neocor-
tices of postnatal day 1 Nf1fl/fl GFAP-Cre mice (13, 14). The sex of 
resultant  cultures  was  confirmed  by  expression  of  the  X-  and  
Y-encoded paralogs Jarid1c and Jarid1d (refs. 15, 16, and Figure 1A), 
and complete loss of NF1 expression was verified by Western blot 
(Figure 1B). Equal purity of male and female astrocyte cultures was 
established by their near uniform expression of astrocyte markers 
(GFAP and aldolase C) and the absence of neuronal (NF200) or 
oligodendrocyte  (CNPase)  marker  expression  (Figure  1C).  Male 
and female Nf1–/– astrocytes were infected with retrovirus encoding 
a flag-tagged dominant-negative form of p53 (DNp53) and EGFP 

4 1 2 4

(DNp53-IRES-EGFP)  (17).  DNp53-expressing  cells  were  purified 
by  FACS  based  on  EGFP  expression  (Figure  1D).  Western  blot 
analysis indicated that endogenous p53 and the flag-tagged DNp53 
construct were similarly expressed in male and female astrocytes 
(Figure  1E).  Equivalent  loss  of  p53  function  in  male  and  female 
Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  was  validated  by  the  parallel  reduction 
in expression of multiple transcriptional targets of p53, including 
Bai1, p21 (also known as Waf1 and Cip1), and Gadd45a (Figure 1F).
After establishing the astrocyte cultures, we first measured the 
effects of NF1 and p53 loss on growth in vitro. While male and female 
Nf1–/– astrocytes exhibited similar growth rates, the additional loss 
of p53 function led to a significantly greater increase in the growth 
of  male  astrocytes  compared  with  female  astrocytes  (Figure  2A). 
These data indicate that sex may influence the functional conse-
quences of tumor suppressor loss in a cell-intrinsic fashion.

Combined in vivo loss of Nf1 and p53 was shown to be suffi-
cient for gliomagenesis in mice (11). To determine whether male 
and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes were transformed, we eval-
uated  their  anchorage-independent  growth  in  soft  agar  colony 
formation assays and their tumorigenic potential in intracranial 
xenograft  assays.  Neither  male  nor  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astro-
cytes formed colonies in soft agar (Figure 2B). Tissue analysis 3 
months after intracranial implantation revealed that 2 of 7 mice 
with male Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocyte implants and 2 of 7 mice with 
female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocyte  implants  had  tumors  (data  not 
shown). Thus, in this model, sequential loss of NF1 and p53 func-
tion is only weakly transforming.

Next,  we  treated  male  and  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes 
with PDGF or EGF. The PDGF and EGF pathways are frequently 
activated  in  GBM  (8,  18–20).  The  PDGF  receptor  was  equally 
expressed in male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes, and treat-
ment with PDGF was without sex-specific effects on ERK1/2 and 
AKT phosphorylation, soft agar colony formation, or intracranial 
tumorigenesis (Supplemental Figure 2).

The EGFR is amplified or mutationally activated in more than 
50%  of  all  GBM  (21),  and  EGF  can  promote  transformation  in 
vitro  (22).  While  EGFR  mutational  activation  and  amplification 
is most common in classical GBM, it also occurs in nearly 10% of 
Mes-GBM (8). Strikingly, EGF treatment resulted in the frequent 
formation of large (>100-μm diameter) colonies but only in male 
soft agar cultures (Figure 2B). The persistence of green fluores-
cence in male and female cells throughout the experiment indi-
cated that the failure to transform female cells was not due to the 
loss of DNp53 expression. To determine whether the difference in 
transformation might be due to differences in EGFR expression 
or  activation,  we  treated  male  and  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astro-
cytes with EGF and measured EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 
and AKT by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Male and 
female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  possessed  comparable  levels  of 
and similar cell-to-cell uniformity in EGFR expression and similar 
patterns of EGF-induced ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Supple-
mental Figure 3). Together, these data indicate that both male and 
female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes are transformable but that they can 
possess different thresholds for in vitro transformation, particu-
larly in response to growth factor stimulation.

To determine whether in vitro sexual dimorphism in transfor-
mation would translate to differences in in vivo tumorigenesis, we

implanted male and female EGF-treated Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes 
into the brains of both male and female nude mice. In contrast to 
the minimal tumorigenic potential of untreated and PDGF-treated 
male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes, 100% of recipient mice 
(14 of 14 male, 8 of 8 female) implanted with male EGF-treated Nf1–/–  
DNp53 cells developed tumors and succumbed to disease (Figure 
3A). Strikingly, only 36% of recipient mice (5 of 14 male and 3 of 
8 female) implanted with female EGF-treated Nf1–/– DNp53 cells 
developed tumors and died (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). Tumors 
were recognizable in situ by their EGFP fluorescence (Figure 3B), 
confirming persistent transgene (DNp53) expression. Pathological 
evaluation diagnosed the tumors as high-grade gliomas based on 
GFAP  expression,  nuclear  atypia,  mitoses,  and  necrosis  (ref.  23 
and  Figure  3C).  Notably,  there  were  no  histological  distinctions 
between tumors derived from male and female cells (Supplemen-
tal Figure 4, A and B). The presence of viable EGFP-positive cells 
at  the  injection  sites  in  brains  of  asymptomatic  mice  harboring 
female Nf1–/– DNp53 implants indicated that graft failure and loss 
of DNp53 expression were not reasons for the lack of tumor forma-
tion (Supplemental Figure 4, C and D).

The in vivo results suggested that intracranial tumorigenesis 
was determined by the sex of the implanted cells and not by the 
sex of the recipient mouse. To directly test whether the sex of the 
microenvironment and circulating sex hormones influence tum-
origenesis, we simultaneously implanted male and female EGF-
treated  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  into  the  flanks  of  8  male  and  9 
female NCR nude mice. Twelve of seventeen male implants (71%) 
formed tumors (Figure 3D) equally in male (5 of 8) and female (7 
of 9) recipient mice (P = 0.62, Fisher’s exact test). Six of seventeen 
female implants (35%) formed tumors, again without difference 
between male (3 of 8) and female (3 of 9) recipient mice (P = 1, 
Fisher’s  exact  test).  Moreover,  male  cells  exhibited  significantly 
greater  maximal  tumor  growth  (Figure  3E).  Thus,  in  both  the 
intracranial  and  flank  locations,  male  EGF-treated  Nf1–/–  DNp53 
astrocytes more readily formed tumors than their female counter-
parts, regardless of the sex of the surrounding tumor microenvi-
ronment. These data demonstrate that, in this model, sex-specific 
thresholds exist for transformation and that cell-intrinsic differ-
ences, rather than the sex of the microenvironment, are the stron-
ger determinants of tumor growth.

formation (asterisks) in soft agar with male but not female Nf1–/– DNp53 
astrocytes. Scale bar: 200 μm.

Next, we asked whether sex differences in stem-like cell activ-
ity were a result of p53 inactivation or whether they preexisted as a 
consequence of Nf1 loss. The frequency of clonogenic cells in Nf1–/– 
postnatal day 1 hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) was approx-
imately 2%, and no differences were observed between male and 
female cultures (Figure 4E). To determine whether sex differences 
might emerge with differentiation, we measured clonogenicity in 
Nf1–/– astrocytes. Both male and female Nf1–/– astrocytes possessed 
an  equivalently  low  frequency  (0.2%)  of  cells  with  clonogenic 
potential (Figure 4F). Thus, sex differences in clonogenic stem-
like cell properties between male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astro-
cyte cultures are a result of sexually dimorphic response to the loss 
of p53 function.

To further dissect the mechanistic basis for sex differences 
in transformation, we examined rates of apoptosis and prolifera-
tion in cultured male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes. Apop-
tosis was measured by quantifying levels of cleaved caspase-3 
under  basal  conditions  and  after  etoposide  treatment.  While 
there was a trend toward greater basal and etoposide-induced 
apoptosis  in  male  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes,  this  did  not  reach 
statistical significance (Figure 5A). To measure proliferation, we 
quantified the percentage of nuclei positive for phospho-histone 
H3 (pHH3), a widely used proliferation marker in gliomas (27). 
We  found  that  male  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  exhibited  signifi-
cantly  higher  levels  of  pHH3  positivity  compared  with  female 
Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes (Figure 5B), indicating that they possess 
a higher rate of proliferation.

Mechanisms of sexually dimorphic transformation. To under-
stand  why  male  astrocytes  may  be  more  susceptible  to  malig-
nant transformation, we first measured the clonogenic subpop-
ulation. Loss of p53 function can enhance self-renewal and the 
reacquisition  of  a  multipotent  stem-like  cell  state  (24),  which 
may be essential for malignant transformation of differentiated 
cells (25). Clonogenic cell frequency, as measured by extreme 
limiting dilution assays (ELDA) (26), ranged from 6.1% to 17.6% 
in male Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes and 1.6% to 3.4% in female Nf1–/– 
DNp53 astrocytes (Figure 4, A and B). The greater stem-like cell 
frequency in male Nf1–/– DNp53 cells was associated with higher 
expression of stem cell markers CD133 and Sox2 (Figure 4C) as 
well as the capability of forming larger and greater numbers of 
neurospheres (Figure 4D).

and female (n = 22) Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes from 3 independent litters resulted in death of 100% of mice receiving male cell implants and 36% of mice 
receiving female cell implants (***P < 0.0001, log-rank test). (B) Intracranial tumors were recognizable in situ by their EGFP expression (asterisk). (C) Intra-

rapid transit from G1 to S phase. To 
determine whether the differences 
in  RB  phosphorylation  had  func-
tional consequences, we examined 
E2F-dependent  transcription  and 
cell  cycle  distribution  in  male  and 
female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes 
upon addition of sera. To measure 
E2F-dependent  transcription,  we 
constructed  a  lentiviral  reporter 
system  with  3XE2F-driven  lucifer-
ase  expression  (Supplemental  Fig-
ure 5) and established stable lines of 
male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 E2F-
Luc reporter cells. Male and female 
Nf1–/– DNp53 E2F-Luc reporter cells 
were  serum  starved  for  24  hours 
and then treated with 10% serum-
supplemented  media  for  6  hours. 
As cell number was linearly related 
to  EGFP  fluorescence  (Figure  6C, 
inset),  we  were  able  to  normalize 
E2F-Luc  reporter  activity  to  EGFP 
measures.  Consistent  with 
the 
measured  differences  in  RB  phos-
phorylation,  male  Nf1–/–  DNp53 
astrocytes exhibited a greater level 
of  E2F-Luc  activity  in  response  to 
serum (Figure 6C). As expected, sex 
differences  in  RB  phosphorylation 
and E2F reporter activity were cor-
related with differences in cell cycle 
regulation. While serum starvation 
significantly increased the G1 frac-
tion  in  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astro-
cytes, it produced no significant G1 change in male Nf1–/– DNp53 astro-
cytes, indicating that male cells possessed lower RB activity (Figure 
6D). Together, these findings strongly indicate that RB regulation is 
sexually dimorphic in Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes and that the functional 
consequences of this include greater proliferation in male cells.

To test whether differential inactivation of RB underlies sex 
differences in transformation, we expressed SV40 large T antigen 
(SV40-TAg) in male and female Nf1–/– astrocytes (29). SV40-TAg 
completely inactivates both p53 and RB pathways (reviewed in ref. 
30).  Quantitative  PCR  verified  equal  SV40-TAg  expression  and 
equivalent reductions in expression of p53 transcriptional targets 
p21 and Gadd45a and expected increases and decreases in expres-
sion of E2F targets Cdc6 (31) and Bcl2 (32), respectively (Figure 
7A). In soft agar assays, we found that, in contrast to EGF-treated 
Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes,  both  male  and  female  Nf1–/–  SV40-TAg 
astrocytes were competent to form colonies (Figure 7B). Moreover, 
both male and female Nf1–/– SV40-TAg astrocytes formed tumors 
of similar sizes upon flank implantation (Figure 7C), regardless of 
the sex of recipient mice. These data indicate that under condi-
tions of equivalent combined loss of p53 and RB function, male 
and female astrocytes are equally transformed.

Scale bar: 500 microns. (E) The frequency of clonogenic stem-like cells, as determined by ELDA, was equal in 
male (2.49% ± 1.1%) and female (1.73% ± 0.63) Nf1–/– NSCs. (F) The frequency of clonogenic stem-like cells, as 
determined by ELDA, was equally low (0.2%) in both male and female Nf1–/– astrocytes.

Next, we performed cell cycle analysis. Under basal asynchro-
nous conditions, the fraction of male Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes in 
the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was greater than in their 
female counterparts (Figure 5C). To understand why male Nf1–/– 
DNp53 astrocytes exhibited greater proliferation and S/G2/M cell 
cycle distribution, we examined regulation of the retinoblastoma 
protein (RB) pathway. The RB pathway is a negative regulator of 
proliferation, and RB loss or inactivation is among the most com-
mon features of human cancers (28). To assess RB regulation, we 
serum starved male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes to promote 
arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and then followed RB phos-
phorylation (inactivation) and cell cycle progression after adding 
serum  back.  Western  blot  analysis  indicated  that,  under  condi-
tions of serum starvation, male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes 
expressed comparable levels of RB and phosphorylated RB (Figure 
6, A and B). Upon addition of serum, male Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes 
exhibited  significantly  greater  time-dependent  phosphorylation 
of RB compared with that of female astrocytes.

RB  regulates  transition  from  the  G1  to  the  S  phase  of  the  cell 
cycle through sequestration of E2F transcription factors. Hyperphos-
phorylation of RB or loss of RB expression results in increased E2F-

Loss  of  NF1  and  p53  function  resulted  in  a  greater  rate  of 
growth  and  a  significant  elevation  in  the  fraction  of  clonogenic 
cells  in  male  astrocytes  compared  with  female  astrocytes.  Both 
effects can be related to the observation that male Nf1–/– DNp53 
astrocytes exhibited greater inactivation of RB. A focus on RB as 
the  mediator  of  sex  differences  in  transformation  in  this  model 
is supported by contrasting the effects of p53 loss alone (DNp53) 
to  those  after  combined  loss  of  p53  and  RB  (SV40-TAg).  When 
p53  function  was  abrogated  but  RB  was  left  intact,  significant 
sex differences were apparent in 4 measures: (a) RB inactivation 
in response to serum, (b) proliferation rates, (c) stem cell induc-
tion,  and  (d)  transformation  in  response  to  EGF.  When  RB  and 
p53 were completely inactivated there was no sex difference in in 
vitro transformation or tumorigenicity in vivo. These observations 
strongly suggest that sexual dimorphism in the regulation of RB 
function can contribute to sex differences in cancer. It is interest-
ing to note that the incidence of retinoblastoma, in which there is 
complete inactivation of RB, is equal between males and females 
(33). It is similarly interesting to consider the frequent deletion of 
CDKN2A in classical GBM (8) and whether this potent mechanism 
of  RB  inactivation  is  related  to  the  equal  incidence  of  classical 
GBM in males and females.

Differential  RB  inactivation  may  also  underlie  the  observed 
differences in clonogenic cell activity. While RB’s role in regulat-
ing cell cycle progression has been known for decades (34), its role 
in stem cell function has only been recognized recently. Loss of RB 
function in stem and progenitor cell populations results in multi-
ple cell autonomous abnormalities, including loss of quiescence, 
hyperplasia,  increased  apoptosis,  defective  terminal  differentia-
tion, and tumorigenesis (for review ref. 35).

Future studies will need to address whether cell-intrinsic sex 
differences  in  transformation  will  be  equally  apparent  in  mod-
els  involving  alternate  cells  of  origin,  different  transformation 
paradigms,  and  in  different  mouse  strains.  Mounting  evidence 
indicates  that  GBM  can  arise  from  NSCs,  oligodendrocyte  pro-
genitors, and differentiated glial and neuronal cells (25, 36, 37). It 
will be important to determine whether each potential cell of ori-
gin exhibits similar sex differences and, if not, to investigate the 
mechanisms through which sex and cell type interact.

Similar  to  what  we  observed  with  untreated  Nf1–/–  DNp53 
astrocytes, Zhu et al. found that loss of NF1 followed by loss of p53 
function did not result in tumorigenesis (11). However, when p53 

Discussion
Sex differences in the incidence and progression of human disease 
are increasingly recognized as clinically significant and mechanisti-
cally important. While the acute actions of sex hormones are recog-
nized as critical determinants of many aspects of normal biology and 
pathology, here we provide the first evidence that cell-intrinsic sex 
differences can render male and female cells differentially sensitive 
to malignant transformation. Among the immediate implications of 
this work is that the potential for sex-specific effects should be consid-
ered when evaluating oncogenic mechanisms. This approach is likely 
to illuminate new details of cancer cell biology and could modify our 
approach to cancer surveillance, disease stratification, and treatment.
Male, but not female, astrocytes with complete loss of NF1 
and  p53  function  were  poised  for  transformation  by  activa-
tion  of  growth  factor  pathways.  Differences  in  transformation 
were related to a greater susceptibility for RB inactivation and 
increased induction of a stem-like cell phenotype in male astro-
cytes compared with female astrocytes. The equal transforma-
tion of male and female astrocytes in the setting of complete RB 
and p53 inactivation, as well as the equal incidence of classical 
GBM in males and females, indicate that sex differences in GBM 
and other cancers may be confined to specific subsets of disease.

function was abrogated prior to deletion of Nf1, high-grade gliom-
agenesis ensued in 100% of mice without apparent sex disparity. It 
would be interesting to determine whether additional tumor-pro-
moting events, like activation of the EGFR pathway, would reveal 
sex differences in tumorigenesis in mice with inactivation of NF1 
and p53 function under various conditions.

High-grade gliomagenesis in the setting of combined NF1 and 
p53 loss has also been modeled in NPcis mice, which carry a genetic 
construct of tightly linked mutant alleles of NF1 and p53 (38). Simi-
lar to our results, when NPcis mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J 
background,  high-grade  gliomas  occurred  with  a  male  predom-
inance  (12,  39,  40).  Importantly,  129S4/SvJae  mice  were  highly 
resistant to the gliomagenic effects of NPcis mutations. While mod-
ifier loci for the strain- and sex-specific effects have been mapped, 
the mechanisms by which they modify gliomagenesis have not been 
defined. It will be important to determine whether there are similar 
strain effects in our model as well as whether any of the loci involved 
in the effects of sex encode components of the RB pathway.

Finally,  while  the  current  data  extend  our  understanding  of 
how  cell-intrinsic  sexual  dimorphism  can  contribute  to  sex  dif-
ferences in cancer, they do not diminish the potential role of sex 
hormones  in  oncogenesis,  cancer  progression,  and  response  to 
therapy.  Thus,  future  studies,  particularly  those  involving  mod-
els,  such  as  the  4-core  genotypes  model  of  sex  differences,  will 
be especially important for illuminating the contributions of both 
chromosomal and gonadal sex to cancer biology (41).

Methods

Chemicals, media, and sera
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma- 
Aldrich, and all tissue culture media was obtained from Invitrogen.

Sex determination in publically accessible gene expression data sets
Detailed methods for sex determination in gene expression data sets 
are provided in the legend to Supplemental Figure 1.

Male and female astrocyte cultures
Primary  cultures  of  astrocytes  were  prepared  from  the  neocortices  of 
individual postnatal day 1 Nf1fl/fl GFAP-Cre mice and cultured in DMEM/
F12 supplemented with 10% FBS as previously described (14, 42). Nf1fl/fl  
GFAP-Cre mice were a gift from David Gutmann (Washington Univer-
sity School of Medicine). The sex of each mouse was determined from 
tail DNA by PCR for Jarid1c and Jarid1d (15, 16). All male and female cells 
from at least a single litter with the same genotype were pooled. Repli-
cate  experiments  were  performed  using  low-passage  (≤6)  astrocytes 
isolated from at least 3 independent litters. Purity of astrocyte cultures 
was determined by immunolabeling for specific markers for astrocytes 
(GFAP [1:250, Invitrogen] and aldolase C [1:200, Santa Cruz]), neurons 
(NF200 [1:250, Sigma-Aldrich]), and oligodendrocytes (CNPase [1:500, 
Sigma-Aldrich]). Immunolabeling was detected with Alexa Fluor 555– 
or  488–conjugated  secondary  antibodies  (Molecular  Probes).  Nuclei 
were  counterstained  with  DAPI  (1:10,000).  Fluorescent  images  were 
obtained using an inverted fluorescent microscope (IX51, Olympus).

Isolation of Nf1–/– NSCs
Nf1–/–  NSCs  were  isolated  from  the  hippocampi  of  Nf1fl/fl  GFAP-Cre 
postnatal day 1 pups. Briefly, the hippocampus was dissected out of 
whole brain and incubated in digest media for 10 minutes at 37°C as 
previously described (43). Cells from each hippocampus were main-
tained separately in neurosphere media (neurobasal medium supple-
mented with N2, B27, EGF, bFGF, and LIF) until the sex of the pups 
was identified by PCR. Single cell suspensions were prepared with trit-
uration and passed through a 40-μm cell strainer.

Expression of DNp53 and SV40-TAg in Nf1–/– astrocytes
DNp53-IRES-EGFP–encoding retrovirus was generated by transfect-
ing Plat-E cells (gift from Steven Teitelbaum, Washington University 
School of Medicine) with a pMIG-DNp53-EGFP construct provided by 
Emily  Cheng  (Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center,  New  York, 
New York, USA). The resultant viral media were used to infect male 
and female Nf1–/– astrocytes with polybrene (5 μg/ml). Nf1–/– DNp53-
EGFP–positive cells were sorted to purity using a MoFlo high speed

flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). SV40-TAg retrovirus was similarly 
generated  using  pBabe-Neo-SV40-TAg  plasmid  provided  by  Sheila 
Stewart (Washington University School of Medicine). After infection, 
the  Nf1–/–  SV40-TAg  astrocytes  were  selected  by  G418  (250  μg/ml) 
containing media for 4 weeks. SV40-TAg expression was confirmed by 
quantitative RT-PCR in resultant G418-resistant clones.

Growth assays
Nf1–/– or Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes were grown in 6-well plates (20,000 
cells per well). Viable cell numbers were measured every 24 hours by 
Trypan Blue exclusion (final concentration 0.1%) using a Cellometer 
Auto T4 cell counter (Nexcelom Bioscience) with triplicate wells per 
time point per sex.

Soft agar assays
Colony  formation  assays  were  performed  in  soft  agar  plates  as 
described  previously  (29).  Briefly,  0.6%  Difco  Noble  Agar  (BD  Bio-
science) in DMEM/F12 media with 10% FBS was plated on the bot-
tom layer and 0.3% agar was plated on the top layer, which contained 
astrocytes.  In  some  experiments,  astrocytes  were  treated  with  EGF 
(50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) or PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 
a week prior to the assays. EGF or PDGF was also added to the soft 
agar when cells were plated, and colony formation was evaluated 3 to 
4 weeks later based on EGFP expression.

Limiting dilution assays
Male and female Nf1–/– NSCs, Nf1–/– astrocytes, and Nf1–/– DNp53 astro-
cytes were diluted to various densities (3,000, 600, 120, 24, 5, and 

1 cell per well) in neurosphere media and plated in 96-well ultralow 
cluster plates (Corning), with 10 to 12 wells per concentration. Sphere 
formation  was  measured  7  days  after  plating.  Clonogenic  stem-like 
cell  frequency  was  analyzed  using  the  Extreme  Limiting  Dilution 
Analysis (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/).

Tumorigenesis assays
Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  treated  with  50  ng/ml  EGF  were  implanted 
either into the brains or flanks of nude mice. For intracranial implanta-
tions, 100,000 cells were stereotactically implanted to the cerebral cor-
tices of nude mice as described previously (44). Mice with intracranial 
tumors were sacrificed when symptomatic. For flank implantations, 1 
million male or female Nf1–/– DNp53 cells in 50 μl Matrigel (BD Biosci-
ence) were implanted in the left or right flank, respectively, of the same 
mouse. Flank tumors were measured weekly with a digital caliper.

Cell  cycle  analysis.  Ethanol-fixed  cells  were  washed  in  PBS  plus 
0.1% FBS and resuspended in propidium iodide–staining (PI-staining) 
solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mg/ml DNase- and pro-
tease-free RNase A, and 10 μg/ml PI in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 
hour at room temperature in the dark and filtered through a 35-micron 
cell strainer. Flow cytometry was done on a FACSCalibur system (Bec-
ton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton 
Dickinson). Aggregates and debris were excluded from the analysis.

Quantitative real-time PCR 
Quantitative PCR assays were performed using SYBR Green 2x PCR Mas-
ter Mix (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was generated from total RNA with 
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s 

4 1 3 0

The Journal of Clinical Investigation   ReseaRch aRticlejci.org   Volume 124   Number 9   September 2014instructions. PCR and data collection were done using the Bio-Rad Mini-
Opticon Real-Time PCR machine and Opticon Monitor 3 software from 
Bio-Rad (Hercules). Relative transcript copy number for each gene and 
corresponding GAPDH sample were calculated using the ΔΔC(t) method. 
PCR primers used in these studies are listed in Supplemental Table 1.

Western blotting
Western  blots  were  performed  using  the  Odyssey  Infrared  Imaging 
system (LI-COR) as previously described (45). Total protein (30~50 μg 
per lane) was loaded onto a 4% to 12% Nu-Page gradient gel (Invitro-
gen) for most experiments, except for the detection of NF1 (150 μg total 
protein per lane). Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight, 
except for mouse anti–β actin (1:40,000, Sigma-Aldrich), which was 
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Secondary antibody incu-
bation was at room temperature for 1 hour. Primary antibodies used 
in this study were rabbit anti-NF1 (1:200, Santa Cruz), goat anti-p53 
(1:500, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-FLAG (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich).

For  evaluation  of  EGF  and  PDGF  signaling  pathways,  male  and 
female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes were serum starved for 24 hours and then 
treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for the indicated 
times. Western blots were performed as described above using antibod-
ies  from  Cell  Signaling  Technology  (CST):  rabbit  anti-EGFR  (1:500), 
rabbit  anti-PDGFR  β  (1:1,000),  rabbit  anti-pAKT  (1:500),  pERK1/2 
(1:1,000), mouse anti-pan AKT (1:500), and pan ERK1/2 (1:1,000).

For  evaluation  of  RB  phosphorylation,  male  and  female  Nf1–/– 
DNp53 astrocytes were serum starved for 48 hours and then treated 
with 10% serum-supplemented media for the indicated times. West-
ern blots were performed as described above with the following anti-
bodies from CST: rabbit anti-RB (1:800) and rabbit anti-phosphory-
lated RB (S807/811, 1:1,000).

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue. Mouse brains were perfused with PBS followed by 4% para-
formaldehyde.  After  paraffin  embedding,  tissue  was  sectioned  for 
standard hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining 
as previously described (45).

Cell  culture.  Male  and  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  cells  were  grown  on 
coverslips for 48 hours, followed by 24-hour serum starvation before 
EGF (50 ng/ml) treatment. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 15 minutes and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 30 
minutes at room temperature, and nonspecific antibody staining was 
blocked with normal serum. Immunodetection was performed as pre-
viously described with antibodies specific for phospho-ERK1/2 (rabbit 
IgG 1:500, CST) and EGFR (rabbit IgG 1:50, CST). Nonspecific rabbit 
IgG control served as control.

pHH3 staining
Cell  proliferation  was  measured  by  pHH3  (Ser10)  immunolabeling. 
Male and female Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes were cultured for 48 hours 
on coverslips precoated by Poly-l-Lysine and Poly-Ornithine (Sigma- 
Aldrich). Cells were prepared for immunolabeling, and immunohis-
tochemistry  was  performed  following  standard  procedures  using 
rabbit  anti-pHH3  (CST;  1:500  with  1%  BSA  and  biotin).  After  DAB 
development,  coverslips  were  rinsed  with  PBST  and  mounted  in 
Immuno  Mount  (GeneTex).  Cells  with  positive  pHH3  staining  were 
counted by ImageJ. Final results were obtained from >1,000 cells per 
sex derived from 3 independent litters.

Etoposide-induced caspase-3 cleavage
Cleaved caspase-3, measured by Western blot, was used as an indi-
cator  for  apoptosis.  Male  and  female  Nf1–/–  DNp53  astrocytes  were 
treated with either DMSO or etoposide (10 μg/ml) for 24 hours, and 
cell  lysates  were  harvested  for  Western  blotting.  Intact  and  cleaved 
caspase-3 were detected with rabbit anti–caspase-3 (1:600, CST) and 
anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:400, CST).

E2F-Luc reporter assay
To construct the lentiviral E2F-Luc reporter system, we first inserted 
3XE2F binding sites (46), provided by Wilhelm Krek (ETH Zurich) and 
Hans  Rotheneder  (Medical  University  of  Vienna,  Vienna,  Austria), 
into the pGL4.26 (Promega) reporter construct. The DNA fragment 
encoding 3XE2F-Luc (including the upstream poly-A signal) and the 
SV40  promoter-hygromycin  resistance  gene  (including  the  down-
stream poly-A sequence [HygR]) were amplified by PCR using primers 
with 5′-NdeI and 3′-EcoRI linkers. Subsequently, a fragment encoding 
the  CMV  promoter-GFP  cassette  of  the  pRRLsinCMV-GFP  vector 
(47) was removed by NdeI and EcoRI digestion and replaced with the 
3XE2F-Luc  SV40-HygR  encoding  PCR  product.  E2F-Luc  lentivirus 
was prepared from the final pRRLsin-E2F-Luc by cotransfecting 293T 
cells with both pRRLsin-E2F-Luc construct and the packing plasmids 
(Delta8.9 and VSV-G) as described previously (48). Viral media were 
collected  48  hours  after  293T  transfection,  and  media  were  centri-
fuged, followed by filtering through a 0.44-μm filter, before infecting 
Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes. Stable male and female E2F-Luc–expressing 
Nf1–/– DNp53 astrocytes were established by hygromycin (250 μg/ml) 
selection for 3~4 weeks.

A linear correlation between EGFP expression and cell number 
was established by serial dilution of reporter astrocytes from 3 inde-
pendent litters (4 replicate wells per concentration per sex per prep-
aration)  in  a  96-well  plate  with  white  walls  (Costar).  EGFP  signals 
were read 3 hours after plating using a Synergy Neo HTS Multi-Mode 
microplate  reader  (Biotek),  and  EGFP  signals  were  plotted  against 
actual cell number.

E2F  reporter  activity  was  measured  in  male  and  female  Nf1–/– 
DNp53 E2F-Luc astrocytes that had been serum starved for 24 hours 
and then stimulated or not with 10% FBS in phenol red–free DMEM/
F12 for 6 hours. At 6 hours after serum treatment, total EGFP fluo-
rescence per well was measured as described above. Total luciferase 
activity  was  measured  using  the  One-Glo  Luciferase  Assay  System 
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Total lucifer-
ase activity was normalized to total EGFP fluorescence. For each treat-
ment condition, 4 replicate wells per sex per preparation were read, 
and the final results were from 4 independent biological replicates of 
male and female reporter astrocyte cultures.

Statistics
Student’s  t  test  was  used  to  compare  quantitative  measurements 
between 2 groups. ANOVA was used to analyze differences in in vitro 
longitudinal growth and RB phosphorylation between sexes. Tumor 
formation by sex was compared by Fisher’s exact test. Sex-dependent 
differences  in  flank  tumor  size  were  evaluated  with  Wilcoxon  rank 
test. Log-rank test was used to determine sex differences in survival 
between mouse groups with intracranial implantation of either male 
or female Nf1–/– DNp53 cells. All tests were 2 sided, and a P value of 
less  than  0.05  was  considered  significant.  All  quantitative  data  are
