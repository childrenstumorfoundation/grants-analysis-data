Pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGG) that are unresectable often require adjuvant chemotherapy such as carboplatin/vincristine.
Small Phase II studies have suggested equivalent efficacy of single agent 4-weekly carboplatin. A single-institution retrospec-
tive review captured all patients aged 0 to 18 years diagnosed with LGG between 1996 and 2013 and treated with carboplatin
monotherapy. The response and survival according to tumor site was compared to published results for multiagent chemother-
apy. Of 268 children diagnosed with LGG diagnosed in this period, 117 received chemotherapy and 104 children received
single agent carboplatin as first line chemotherapy. All patients received carboplatin at 560 mg/m2, four-weekly for a median
of 12 courses. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.8 years (range 3m–16y) and 32% had neurofibromatosis type 1. With a mean
followup of 54 months, 86% of patients achieved stabilisation or better (SD/PR/CR). 3-year progression free survival (PFS)
66% (95% CI 57–76%), and 5-year PFS was 51% (95% CI 41–63%). 5-year overall survival was 97%. Multivariate analysis
showed poorer PFS for those with chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors. In this retrospective analysis single agent carboplatin
shows comparable efficacy to historical multiagent chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable LGG.
Equivalent outcomes are achieved with less chemotherapy, reduced side effects and fewer hospital visits. Further research is
required to establish the place of this simplified regimen in the up-front treatment of unresectable LGG.

Low-grade gliomas (LGG) are the most common central
nervous system tumors in children. They occur throughout
childhood, arise in many locations and, while heterogeneous
in their histology, are characterized by an indolent clinical
behavior.1

The optimal management of most LGG is surgical resec-
tion which carries excellent event-free survival (EFS).2 Where
complete resection is not possible the best
therapeutic
approach remains unclear. While radiotherapy has been used
widely in this setting and is effective,3 the long-term toxicity
is signiﬁcant4 particularly in young children. Newer radio-
therapy techniques are being utilized to minimise toxicity5
but radiotherapy is generally avoided in young children if at
all possible, particularly in children with neuroﬁbromatosis
type I (NF-1).

Several chemotherapy protocols have been developed to
delay or potentially avoid radiotherapy altogether. The most
commonly used combination of carboplatin and vincristine
showed an objective response rate of 56% and a 3-year pro-
gression-free survival (PFS) of 68% in a cohort of 78 children
with a mean age of 3 years.6 PFS in this study was age
dependent with those under 5 years having a 3-year PFS of
74% whereas older children had a 3-year PFS of 39%. In the
HIT-LGG-1996 Study, 216 patients who were treated with 12
months of vincristine and carboplatin had a 5-year PFS of
51% with outcome inﬂuenced by extent of surgical resection
and tumor location.7

A large randomized study comparing TPCV (Thiogua-
nine/procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine)
to carboplatin/vin-
cristine found a nonstatistically signiﬁcant improvement in 5-
year EFS in favor of TPCV (52% vs. 39%)8 but there is a
concern that TPCV may increase the long-term risk of sec-
ond malignancy and infertility, especially in patients with
NF-1.

Following an initial study comparing single agent carbo-
platin with iproplatin in children with progressive or recur-
rent brain tumors,9 two Phase II studies reported the efﬁcacy
of single agent carboplatin in children with newly diagnosed
LGG.10,11 Both studies treated patients with single agent car-
boplatin at 560 mg/m2 for a planned 12 treatments. In the
ﬁrst study of 12 children with optic pathway gliomas 3-year

Carboplatin in pediatric low grade glioma

What’s new?
There may be a simpler chemotherapy option for children with low-grade glioma. When the tumor cannot be completely
removed by surgery, chemotherapy can stave off recurrence. Currently recommended chemotherapy regimens, which include
multiple agents, are costly and difficult for patients. In this paper, the authors report on a simplified chemotherapy regiment,
carboplatin alone. Analyzing data collected from 18 years’ worth of patients, they show that carboplatin monotherapy worked
just as well as conventional multiagent therapies, with similar survival rates but fewer hospital visits and less severe side
effects.

EFS was 83%. The second,
larger, study reports on 81
patients receiving single agent carboplatin for LGG in all
locations. They report an 85% rate of disease stabilisation or
better and a 3-year failure free survival of 64%.

Here we report our experience with a large cohort of
patients with LGG treated with a simpliﬁed regimen of single
agent carboplatin given four-weekly and compare the out-
come with published multiagent chemotherapy regimens.
After contributing to the larger Phase II trial,13 this protocol
became standard of care in our institution after the study
closed. This protocol continued to be used to determine indi-
cations for and modiﬁcations to treatment.

Material and Methods
All patients (0–18 years) at our institution diagnosed with
LGG between 1996 and 2013 were identiﬁed from hospital
databases and the relevant clinical, diagnostic and treatment
data were abstracted from the clinical record. The review was
conducted with institutional ethics approval. Patients without
a biopsy were included if the clinical features and tumor
imaging were consistent with the diagnosis of LGG.

Clinical features recorded included age at diagnosis, gen-
der, and the presence or absence of NF-1, while treatment
details included the date and nature of surgical intervention,
the degree of resection and the dose and timing of chemo-
therapy. Clinical outcome data recorded included any dis-
ease- or treatment-related events, visual acuity, the measured

and calculated time

response

Response evaluations were recorded during and on com-
pletion of therapy and best response was recorded. Complete
response, partial response and stable disease were ascertained
using the revised RECIST criteria.12 Time to tumour progres-
sion, time to death and time to censoring were all calculated
from the date of starting treatment with carboplatin. Progres-
sion was deﬁned as the decision to institute further therapy
by the treating clinician, be it based on radiological progres-
sion, visual deterioration or the development of other clinical
symptoms such as to warrant therapy.

The most recent 20 patients’ charts were interrogated to
determine number of outpatient consults, number of outpa-
tient infusional visits, number of inpatient days required due
to therapy toxicity, number of transfusions of red blood cells
and platelets and number of visits for toxicity monitoring

(e.g., audiograms). This was compared to 10 patients treated
according to the SIOP LGG 04 study using carboplatin and
vincristine.

Statistical analysis was completed using the “survival”13
package in the R language.14 Kaplan–Meier analysis of sur-
vival was used throughout with univariate p values generated
using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was
used for multivariate analysis.

Results
268 children aged 0-18 years were diagnosed with LGG at
our institution over the 18 year period from 1996 to 2013.
Of these, 117 children received chemotherapy as part of their
treatment and 104 children received single agent carboplatin
as their ﬁrst line of nonsurgical therapy. The remaining 13
patients had other ﬁrst line therapy and were not included in
the analysis. The 151 children who did not receive chemo-
therapy either had surgery alone or observation only. All
patients receiving carboplatin were treated according to the
schedule described by Gururungan et al.13 This involves infu-
sion of 560 mg/m2/dose of carboplatin on a four-weekly
schedule for a planned 12 doses. Criteria for starting therapy
were progressive or recurrent LGG in patients aged under 18
years old. Histologic conﬁrmation was not
required in
tumors which had clinical and radiological characteristics
consistent with LGG and biopsy was deemed to carry exces-
sive risk.

Indication to start treatment was radiological progression/
recurrence in 76 courses (73%), visual decline in 23 (22%),
proptosis in 3 (3%) and diencephalic syndrome in 2 (2%). As
this was a retrospective review, dose or drug alterations were
not mandated by a prospective protocol but patients were
managed by the same clinicians over the period studied and
conformed very closely to the modiﬁcations described in the
Phase II study of carboplatin monotherapy.13

There were 18 children (17%, 12 with NF-1) with chias-

mus, hypothalamus or basal ganglia with no involvement of
the optic chiasm.

Patients received a median of 12 doses (4-weekly) with a
range of 1–15 doses. Serious reactions to carboplatin were
rare with four hypersensitivity reactions (3.8%), 1 case of
treatment related hearing loss and one case of hematuria
(Table 2). In two cases of hypersensitivity which occurred at
or after dose 10 treatment was stopped early. For the remain-
ing four patients treatment was changed—to temozolomide
in three cases and to TPCV in another.

Radiological response evaluation was possible in all treat-
ment courses. Stable disease was achieved in 79 patients, par-
tial response in nine and complete response in one. Overall
86% achieved stabilisation of disease or better (SD/PR/CR).

Mean follow-up was 54 months. Kaplan–Meier analysis
showed a 3-year PFS of 66% (95% CI 57–76%), a 5-year PFS
of 51% (95% CI 41–63%) and the overall survival for the
whole cohort was 97% at 5 years (95% CI 93–100%) (Fig. 1).
Table 3 shows the 5-year PFS along with univariate and mul-
tivariate analysis. On univariate analysis there was no differ-
ence by response to chemotherapy (p – 0.44), no difference
by year of treatment (p – 0.63) and no age-related association
with PFS in our cohort (p – 0.62). Although numbers were
small, children under the age of 1 had similar outcomes to

those over 1 year, as did children under the age of 5 com-
pared with older children. Those patients who had not had
biopsy had better outcome on univariate analysis (p – 0.02)
but this did not retain statistical signiﬁcance on multivariate
analysis. There was a nonsigniﬁcant trend to better outcome
in children with NF-1 (p 5 0.18) (Fig. 2a) but this was not
borne out in multivariate analysis.

Differences by site were observed and were signiﬁcant.
Figure 2b shows the comparative outcome of children with
pre-chiasmatic optic pathway tumors and those with chias-
matic/hypothalamic tumors. The 5-year PFS of children with
prechiasmatic optic pathway tumors was 68%, whereas those
with chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors had a PFS of 34%, a
statistically signiﬁcant difference (p – 0.02). When chias-
matic/hypothalamic gliomas were compared with all other
sites the trend remained but this did not retain statistical sig-
niﬁcance (p 5 0.08) (Fig. 2d). Central, nonchiasmatic tumors
involving either the thalamus, hypothalamus or basal ganglia,
but with no involvement of the optic chiasm, had a 5-year
PFS for this group was 50%, no different from with the 5-
year PFS for noncentral tumors of 56% (p 5 0.74) (Fig. 2c).

Subset analysis of patients without NF-1 showed similar
patterns to the overall cohort with no difference in PFS by
response, age or year of treatment. Chiasmatic/hypothalamic
tumors trended to poorer PFS but numbers were small and
this did not reach signiﬁcance (p – 0.22). Subset analysis of
children with NF-1 showed no difference in PFS by response,
age or year of treatment but the difference in PFS between
chiasmatic/hypothalamic gliomas and other sites was signiﬁ-
cant (p – 0.04).

Multivariate analysis showed that only chiasmatic/hypo-
thalamic site retained statistical signiﬁcance for a poorer PFS
with a hazard ratio of 3.75 (Table 3). Central, nonchiasmatic
tumors had no detectable difference to other sites.

Visual assessments were available on 37/39 children who
started treatment for optic pathway tumors. Visual acuity
was derived from logMAR charts or Kay pictures depending
on age and ability of the child. Five children were infants at
the time of starting therapy and visual acuity was unable to
be quantiﬁed. Five had normal vision before and after ther-
apy (treatment was started for nonvisual reasons). When the
indication for treatment was visual decline,

(70%) showed no change in vision, while 19% improved and
11% deteriorated.

There were 13 patients with LGG who received ﬁrst line
treatment other than single agent carboplatin. Treatment
was carboplatin/vincristine in nine cases, radiotherapy in 1
and other chemotherapy regimens for the remaining 3.
Mean age of this group was younger at 3.6 years (range 5
months – 11 years). Fewer had NF-1 (two patients, 15%)
and more had tumors in central locations (5 patients, 38%).
5-year PFS in this group was 35% (95% CI 15–82%) and 5-
year OS was 89% (95% CI 71–100%). When the groups
receiving carboplatin and not receiving carboplatin were
combined – an analysis of all 117 patients receiving ﬁrst
line nonsurgical therapy—the 3-year PFS was 65% (95% CI
57–75%) and 5-year PFS was 49% (95% CI 40–60%).

We compared the mean number of outpatient visits per
patient to that of children treated in our institution with vin-
cristine and carboplatin (SIOP LGG 04 protocol) in order to
assess the impact of treatment on the patient and family. For
patients treated with carboplatin monotherapy the mean
number of outpatient visits during treatment was 15, this

compares with 26 for those treated on the SIOP LGG proto-
col. Mean number of infusional visits was 12 compared with
43 for patients following SIOP LGG 04. There was no differ-
ence in mean number of inpatient days (3 days) by regimen,
nor transfusion requirements.

Discussion
We report the largest cohort of patients with unresectable
LGG treated with a simpliﬁed regimen of single agent carbo-
platin given four-weekly and have compared the outcome
with published multi-agent chemotherapy regimens. Although
complete surgical resection is the optimal approach for most
LGG, many of these tumors cannot be safely removed. While
radiotherapy is effective its toxicity precludes its use in young
children for these low grade tumors. This leaves many young
children with a chronic relapsing-remitting disease requiring
treatment over many years.15 Reducing therapy and simplify-
ing the treatment of LGG should make treatment less oner-
ous on the patient and family while minimising long-term
treatment related toxicity.

Carboplatin in pediatric low grade glioma

Carboplatin and vincristine has a published 5-year PFS of
between 39%8 and 51%7 and TPCV has a published 5-year
PFS of 52%.8 We have shown that the 5-year PFS for carbo-
platin monotherapy is 51% (95% CI 41–63%), comparing
favourably with established regimens in this disease. This also
conﬁrms the results of previous Phase II studies using carbo-
platin monotherapy.13 Of particular note, single agent carbo-
platin used here achieved excellent outcomes for children
with pre-chiasmatic optic pathway tumors, however, the efﬁ-
cacy of single agent therapy appears site speciﬁc with rela-
tively poor long-term outcome for patients with chiasmatic/
hypothalamic tumors.

Central or diencephalic tumors have been shown in other
studies to have poorer outcomes.7,13 Much of this adverse
prognosis has been attributed to the limited options for sur-
gical resection in this location but in our series we showed a
sharp distinction in outcome between unresectable central
tumors located within and outside the optic pathway. In our
series, central tumors not involving the optic pathway had a
PFS identical to noncentral tumors. It is unlikely that this
result is due to the chemotherapy regimen given and it more
likely reﬂects the biology of these tumors.

In this analysis, when chiasmatic/hypothalamic gliomas
are grouped with other optic pathway gliomas—which have
an excellent PFS—the combined PFS for all optic pathway
tumors is equivalent to other locations. When grouped with
the small number of central, nonchiasmatic tumors the com-
bined PFS for all diencephalic tumors is poorer than other
locations. As can be seen in Figure 2c, the behavior and out-
come of these central, nonchiasmatic tumors in this analysis
more closely matches that of noncentral tumors than chias-
matic/hypothalamic tumors. It may be that the biology of
central, nonchiasmatic tumors more closely mirrors noncen-
tral tumors and so the behavior also mirrors tumors in these
other locations. Most published research groups chiasmatic/
hypothalamic tumors and other central tumors together in
outcome analysis.6,13 Those that separate the groups demon-
strate a difference in prognosis with chiasmatic/hypothalamic
tumors having a poorer outcome.7

The histology of central, nonchiasmatic tumors in this
cohort was 73% pilocytic astrocytoma, 18% astrocytoma
NOS, 9% oligodendroglioma and the histology of biopsied
chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors in this cohort was 82% pilo-
cytic astrocytoma and 18% astrocytoma NOS. Given that his-
tological appearance does not explain difference in behavior,
it may be that molecular analysis will provide greater insight
into this apparent distinction in behavior and outcome.

Unlike other studies we found no signiﬁcant difference in
outcome by age or histology. There was no age group which
separated from other age groups in terms of PFS. Other stud-
ies have shown variable effect of age on PFS, with some
showing better outcome for those under 5 years6 but others
showing poorer outcome for those diagnosed under 5 years.8
While outcome by NF-1 status in our series showed a trend
for improved PFS for those with NF-1 this did not reach sta-

tistical signiﬁcance. This may reﬂect a true difference which
was unable to be brought to statistical signiﬁcance by the
limitation of numbers in this series as other large studies
consistently report a better PFS for patients with NF-1.7,16

Response evaluation in this group was reported using
RECIST 1.1 criteria14 and we report a relatively low rate of
partial and complete responses at 10% of the total group.
There is no one agreed way to measure tumor response in
this tumor type. RECIST uses the sum of the diameters of the
tumor, some response assessments use maximal 2-dimensional
cross-sectional area13 and others use 3-dimensional methods.16
Even within any one method, some use contrast enhancing
components16 and others use T2/FLAIR sequences,8 variable
targets are set for meeting criteria for a partial response and
sometimes a category of “minor response” is included.

RECIST sets a relatively high threshold for assigning a
partial response and there is no minor response category.
This may explain the lower rate of partial responses seen in
our series compared with others published reports. Of note,
as shown in other series,6 response was not correlated with
PFS with no difference in outcome between those who
achieved partial or complete response compared to stable
disease.

Comparisons between chemotherapeutic regimens are dif-
ﬁcult to interpret in light of the large number of potential
confounding variables. Differences
in the proportion of
tumors in different locations, heterogeneous histopathology,
age, prior treatment and the proportion of patients with NF-
1 all may inﬂuence the interpretation of data and the com-
parison of different studies. In addition the clinical behavior
of these tumors means the risk of progression persist beyond
5 years, so comparative analysis of PFS at 3 years may be less

What can be seen in this comparison is that all regimens
have very similar 5-year PFS, between 39 and 52%. Both of
these ﬁgures forming the ends of the range are from the
randomized trial reported by Ater et al.8 comparing vincris-
tine/carboplatin (39%) and TPCV (52%). In the discussion of
this paper, the largest published randomized trial of chemo-
therapy in pediatric LGG, the authors note that the planned
analysis by stratiﬁed log-rank test did not reach statistical sig-
niﬁcance and only the secondary, data-driven analysis showed
a signiﬁcant difference between regimens, casting doubt on
the true difference between regimens.

What is clear is that in the past 20 years there has been
no conclusive proof of the superiority of one chemotherapy
regimen over another in the treatment of LGG. With this in
mind, we believe the focus for determining treatment should
be on quality of life, avoidance of toxicity and late effects for
children with these indolent tumors. Reducing short and long
term treatment related toxicity is a common goal across the
childhood cancer spectrum especially where the rate of cure
is high. Here, we show the use of single agent carboplatin is

associated with a very low incidence of acute carboplatin
related hypersensitivity (4%) compared to the frequency seen
in other published studies using more frequent carboplatin
dosing. Hypersensitivity reactions are well documented in
adults17,18 and children19,20 receiving carboplatin, and the
reported cumulative incidences vary from 7 to 32% for chil-
dren receiving carboplatin for LGG.6,7 Moreover, we have
avoided the use of vincristine, with its associated acute and
medium term neurotoxicity, especially given the uncertainty
of its efﬁcacy in the treatment of this class of brain tumor.

The reason for the low rate of hypersensitivity in this
group is not clear. The mechanism for carboplatin hypersen-
sitivity has never been clearly elucidated and attempts to pre-
vent it occurring have not been successful.21 We speculate
that the reduced frequency of carboplatin dosing compared
with other schedules, allowing for a greater washout period,
may result in less immunogenicity of the drug.

Visual function is variably reported in children with optic
pathway gliomas. A systematic review published in 201022
showed that in 174 children across eight published studies,
14% showed visual
improvement with chemotherapy, 47%
remained stable and 39% experienced deterioration. Fewer
children in this review who started chemotherapy for visual
decline experienced a deterioration in vision (11%) and simi-
lar numbers experienced an improvement in vision (19%).

Many large metropolitan pediatric oncology centres serv-
ice geographically diverse and remote regions. Decreasing the
frequency and intensity of treatment minimises the disrup-
tion of schooling and work, the cost and the dislocation of
patients and families who need to travel to treatment centres
when patients are treated with weekly chemotherapy. More-
over, reducing the frequency of carboplatin related hypersen-
sitivity by less frequent carboplatin dosing may make it safer
for selected patients to be treated in local treatment centres
closer to their home. Our study supports the use of less
intense therapy for these patients. The mean number of out-
patient consultations over a 12 months course of treatment
was 50% fewer than other regimens and the number of
chemotherapy infusion visits was 75% fewer than regimens
using combined carboplatin and vincristine. Cost saving has
not been calculated as this will differ markedly between insti-

tutions and countries but the impact for patients needing to
travel from rural and regional centres for treatment is clear.

There are some important limitations to this study. As a
retrospective study this analysis is vulnerable to selection
bias. Over the period studied there was a complete data cap-
ture of all patients receiving nonsurgical therapy (n 5 117).
When comparing those who received carboplatin as ﬁrst line
therapy and those who did not it is clear that there are more
central tumours receiving other therapies and the mean age
is younger. This may explain the apparent good outcome of
central tumors receiving carboplatin except that of the ﬁve
patients with central tumors receiving other therapies the 5-
year PFS was similar with only one progression within 5
years of starting treatment. Clearly the effect of selection bias
may be present although a combined analysis of all 117
patients receiving nonsurgical therapy suggests the impact is
small.

Another limitation to the study is that there was no cen-
tral review of radiology or pathology. It is conceivable that a
small subset of unbiopsied tumors had histology other than
low grade glioma, particularly the 11 nonoptic pathway
tumors. Progression is difﬁcult to quantify for a number of
reasons. As there was no prospective central review and man-
dated indications for further treatment the analysis relies on
treating clinicians to decide when progression is sufﬁcient to
warrant further therapy. Radiological characteristics alone do
not adequately detail an indication for treatment as a 25%
growth of a large central tumour is likely to be deﬁned as
signiﬁcant progression by a treating clinician and lead to fur-
ther therapy whereas the same percentage growth of a small
posterior fossa nodule may lead to further watchful waiting.
Progressive visual symptoms without radiological progression
may also warrant further therapy. Due to these complexities
the only meaningful way to deﬁne progression in this retro-
spective cohort is to rely on clinician expertise. This is a
potential source of bias in our study. Additionally the pro-
portion of patients with NF-1 is slightly higher than other
reported series.7 The reason for this is not clear, although it
is unlikely to reﬂect selection bias, rather our underlying pop-
ulation, as the proportion of patients with NF-1 in the total
cohort of 117 is also high.

Carboplatin in pediatric low grade glioma

Our analysis supports previous Phase II studies on the
efﬁcacy of single agent four-weekly carboplatin in the treat-
ment of LGG and we suggest
this warrants further
ideally in a randomized controlled trial, as an
research,
option for frontline therapy especially when the goal
is to
reduce potential treatment related toxicity and the healthcare
burden on families. This therapeutic approach is currently

that

being planned for an upcoming Phase III trial for upfront
therapy in unresectable pediatric LGG in Australasia.
