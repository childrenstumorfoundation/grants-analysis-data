SUMMARY

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 is a tumor-predisposing genetic disorder. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas are common
NF1 tumors carrying a risk of malignant transformation, which is typically fatal. Little is known about mech-
anisms mediating initiation and identity of speciﬁc cell type that gives rise to neuroﬁbromas. Using cell-line-
age tracing, we identify a population of GAP43+ PLP+ precursors in embryonic nerve roots as the cells of
origin for these tumors and report a non-germline neuroﬁbroma model for preclinical drug screening to iden-
tify effective therapies. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion provides
fertile ground for continued analysis to deﬁne factors critical for neuroﬁbromagenesis. It also provides unique
approaches to develop therapies to prevent neuroﬁbroma formation in NF1 patients.

INTRODUCTION

The tumor predisposition disorder Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1)
is among the most common human genetic diseases and is
caused by mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which
encodes a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) that negatively regu-
lates p21-RAS signaling (Ballester et al., 1990; Xu et al., 1990).
NF1 patients have defects in neural crest-derived tissues, leading
to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including develop-
mental, pigment or neoplastic aberrations of the skin, nervous
system, bones, endocrine organs, blood vessels, and the eyes
(Cichowski and Jacks, 2001; Ward and Gutmann, 2005; Zhu
et al., 2001). While NF1 patients are predisposed to developing
multiple tumor types (Cichowski et al., 1999; Jett and Friedman,
2010; Le and Parada, 2007; Shannon et al., 1994; Vogel et al.,
1999), the most common occurring are neuroﬁbromas. Neuroﬁ-
bromas are unique and complex tumors that contain proliferating
Schwann-like cells and other local supporting elements of the
nerve ﬁbers, including perineurial cells, ﬁbroblasts, and blood

vessels, as well as inﬁltration of mast cells. Neuroﬁbromas are
classiﬁed into different subtypes. However, for clinical and prog-
nostic implications, many clinicians simply refer to these tumors
as either dermal or plexiform. Dermal neuroﬁbromas are exclu-
sively in the skin and occur in virtually all individuals with NF1.
They initially appear at puberty and increase in number with
age. Although similar to dermal neuroﬁbromas at the cellular
and ultrastructural levels, plexiform neuroﬁbromas develop along
a nerve plexus or involve multiple nerve bundles and are capable
of forming large tumors. Unlike their dermal counterpart, plexi-
form neuroﬁbromas are thought to be congenital and progres-
sively enlarge throughout life. They carry a risk of malignant
transformation that can metastasize widely and are often fatal.
Plexiform neuroﬁbromas can occur anywhere along peripheral
nerve plexus. In fact, deep-tissue neuroﬁbromas occur in 20%–
40% of adult NF1 patients (Tonsgard et al., 1998). The majority
of internal plexiform neuroﬁbromas manifest in the para-spinal re-
gion associated with dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Their chance of
malignant transformation is much higher compared with other

Signiﬁcance

In this study, we utilized a genetically engineered mouse model as a tool to identify the cell of origin for plexiform neuroﬁ-
broma. Using cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+ PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from spi-
nal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their
immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of
primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. Identifying which cell type gives rise to a partic-
ular cancer (the cells of origin) will permit greater understanding of their pathogenesis and inform better design approaches
for their treatment.

forms of plexiform neuroﬁbromas and carries a poorer prognosis,
in part because they are not evident clinically in the early stage. In
addition, because of their location at the neural foramina of the
vertebral column, they can impinge on the spinal cord and nerve
roots, causing pain and neurological deﬁcits. Thus, these para-
spinal neuroﬁbromas represent a serious complication of NF1.

A large body of direct and indirect studies has provided
evidence that NF1 gene deletion is the requisite initial step that
precedes the cascade of interactions with other cell types in
the microenvironment as well as additional cell autonomous
modiﬁcations for neuroﬁbromagenesis (Joseph et al., 2008; Le
et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhu et al.,
2002). Early speculation regarding the cells of origin for neuroﬁ-
bromas came from genetic studies examining the participation
of different cell types including neural crest derivatives in the
pathogenesis of many of the clinical presentations of NF1,
including neuroﬁbroma.
In human neuroﬁbromas, Schwann-
like cells with biallelic NF1 mutations are the most consistently
found cell type, leading to the argument that the tumors initiate
in Schwann cells or their earlier precursors. Indeed, genetic
mouse models have demonstrated that Nf1 deletion in the
Schwann cell lineage is the genetic bottleneck for neuroﬁbroma
development (Cichowski et al., 1999; Joseph et al., 2008; Vogel
et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2002).
During the development of peripheral nerves, neural crest cells
generate Schwann cells in a process that parallels embryonic
development. Migrating neural crest stem cells emerge from
the dorsal horns of the neural tube and move through immature
connective tissue before the time of nerve formation and then
differentiate into Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). These SCPs
then become immature Schwann cells in the developing periph-
eral nerves until early neonatal stages. The differentiation of
immature Schwann cells to form the non-myelinating and myeli-
nating cells of mature nerves essentially occurs postnatally (Jes-
sen and Mirsky, 2005; Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008). Given that
the majority of plexiform neuroﬁbromas in human are congenital
and generally detected at birth or in early infancy, they must arise
from the early Schwann cell
lineage. Indeed, genetic mouse
models have demonstrated that Nf1 deletion in the embryonic
Schwann cell lineage is the genetic bottleneck for neuroﬁbroma
development (Cichowski et al., 1999; Joseph et al., 2008; Vogel
et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2002).
However, the exact developmental stage and embryonic loca-
tion of the Schwann cell lineage that initiate neuroﬁbroma forma-
tion remain unknown. NF1 patients frequently have plexiform
neuroﬁbromas in the para-spinal region at the neural foramina
associated with DRG. In addition, existing mouse models of
NF1 also develop neuroﬁbromas at the DRG regions. We wish
to identify the cells of origin for these para-spinal plexiform
neuroﬁbromas. We reason that they reside in the vicinity of the
embryonic DRGs or at the nearby nerve roots.

RESULTS

Loss of Nf1 in Embryonic DRG/Nerve Root Neurosphere
Cells Gives Rise to Classic Plexiform Neuroﬁbroma
In Vivo
Recent studies have established the value of in vitro sphere
assay to identify cancer stem cells as well as neural stem/pro-

genitor cells (Le et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2008). Therefore,
we examined whether Nf1-deﬁcient embryonic DRG/nerve root
neurosphere cells (DNSCs) could contain the elusive cells of
origin of para-spinal neuroﬁbromas. To obtain Nf1 / 
DNSCs,
we dissected DRGs/nerve roots from E13.5 Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Rosa26(R26R) mouse embryos (Hall, 2006) and performed the
neurosphere culture. These neurosphere cells have high self-
renewal and proliferative potential (Figures S1A–S1D available
online). They were subsequently infected with adenovirus car-
rying the Cre recombinase (Ad-CMV-Cre) to ablate Nf1 and
generate Nf1 / ;LacZ+ DNSCs, which was veriﬁed by genomic
analysis of Nf1 (Figure 1A).
We next implanted Nf1 / ;LacZ+ DNSCs into the sciatic
nerves where close proximity to the nerve environment could
be achieved as previously established through an in vivo neuro-
ﬁbromagenesis assay (Le et al., 2009). The transplanted
Nf1 / ;LacZ+ DNSCs gave rise to plexiform neuroﬁbroma
within four months post implantation, whereas the transplanted
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R controls showed no signs of tumor growth
(Figures 1Ba–1Bd and Table 1). These tumors exhibited all histo-
logical and immunohistochemical features of human plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, including disorganized spindle cells, abundant
collagen matrix, heavy inﬁltration of mast cells and macro-
phages, expression of the Schwann cell marker S100b, and
GAP43 (Figure 1C; Figure S1E). To verify these tumors arise
from transplanted DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells rather
than from the host cells, we took advantage of the fact that
the transplant cells carried the LacZ marker gene but the host
did not. X-gal staining shown that these tumor cells were
LacZ+, which suggested that they arose from transplanted
Nf1 / ;LacZ+ DNSCs. Taken together, these data indicate that
when placed in a favorable microenvironment (in proximity to a
peripheral nerve), Nf1 / ;LacZ+ DNSCs can give rise to bona
ﬁde plexiform neuroﬁbromas. As such, these results show that
DNSCs have the full potential to generate neuroﬁbromas and
indicate that the cells of origin for para-spinal neuroﬁbromas
may be in the embryonic DRGs/nerve roots.

Cells of Origin for Para-Spinal Plexiform Neuroﬁbromas
Are inside the Embryonic PLP+ Cells
Although we successfully induced neuroﬁbroma formation by
transplanting embryonic Nf1 / 
DNSCs to sciatic nerves, it is un-
likely that all the embryonic DNSCs could give rise to plexiform
neuroﬁbroma. In genetic mouse models, Nf1 ablation in embry-
onic Schwann cell lineage (PLP, Krox20, and DHH positive cells)
was sufﬁcient to induce para-spinal plexiform neuroﬁbromas (Le
et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2002), suggesting that all
or at least part of the cells of origin might be inside these PLP+,
Krox20+, and DHH+ embryonic Schwann cell lineage. Therefore,
we next sought to determine this subpopulation within the em-
bryonic DNSCs that could give rise to neuroﬁbroma.

To achieve this, we crossed Plp promoter-driven, tamoxifen-
inducible Cre (PlpCre-ERT) (Leone et al., 2003) transgenic mice
into a Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ (Le et al., 2011) and Flox-stop-Flox
R26R-YFP (Chen et al., 2009) background to generate
PlpCre-ERT;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ-YFP mice. We selectively
ablated the embryonic Nf1 expression by administering 1 mg
tamoxifen orally at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) to pregnant
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ-YFP female mice that have been bred

with PLP+ DNSCs developed sciatic plexiform neuroﬁbroma
DNSCs only led to neuroﬁbroma
(Table 1). By contrast, PLP
in 2 of 20 (10%) mice (Table 1), which suggests that PLP+ DNSCs
DNSCs to contain the cells of origin
are more likely than PLP
DNSCs im-
and that neuroﬁbroma development in the PLP
planted mice is likely the result of contamination of PLP+ DNSCs
during the sorting process as loss of Nf1 is required for neuroﬁ-
broma development. Therefore, given that the Nf1 have been ab-
lated in PLP+ DNSCs and not in PLP
DNSCs after the tamoxifen
induction, we could not exclude the possibility that Nf1 ablation
DNSCs would also give rise to neuroﬁbroma. To address
in PLP

DNSCs were infected with Ad-
this issue, both PLP+ and PLP
CMV-Cre to generate the PLP+;Nf1 / 
DNSCs.
When transplanted to the sciatic nerve of nude mice, PLP+;
Nf1 / 
DNSCs maintained their higher capability to give rise to
neuroﬁbroma (13 of 18, 72.2%), whereas PLP
DNSCs
could only give rise to plexiform neuroﬁbroma in 3 out of 21
(14.3%) mice (Figure 2A and Table 1). Strikingly, we also
observed spontaneous transformation into malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) arising from a fraction of these
sciatic plexiform neuroﬁbromas that originated from PLP+;
Nf1 / 
DNSCs (Figures 2Ai–2Al). This is consistent with human
clinical observations that about 10% of plexiform neuroﬁbromas
undergo malignant transformation (Evans et al., 2002). These
data further indicate that the cells of origin might be within the
embryonic PLP+ DNSCs population.

The PLP+ Cells of Origin Originate
in the Embryonic Nerve Roots
To determine if the embryonic Krox20+
and DHH+ cells are included within PLP+
cell population, we administered tamox-
ifen orally to mother mice at E11.5
to activate PlpCre-ERT to induce the
expression of YFP and genetically label
the PLP+ cells. We next performed immu-
noﬂuorescence staining against Krox20
and DHH and observed that the majority
of the endogenous Krox20 and DHH sig-
nals colocalized with YFP (PLP) in the
nerve root, DRG, and peripheral nerve
(Figure 3A), which indicated that most
the Krox20+ and DHH+ cells were
of
included in the PLP+ cell population. We
also found that PlpCre+ (YFP+ cells) colo-
calized with endogenous PLP, suggest-
ing that the PlpCre+ population is inside
the endogenous PLP+ cell population

ings that Dhh transcripts were expressed
by SCPs both in the dorsal and ventral roots at E13 (Parmantier

appear in embryonic nerve roots at least one day earlier and in
a wider cell population than that of Krox20+ and DHH+ cells

Boundary cap (BC) cells are transient
neural crest-derived population of stem
cells located at
the dorsal root entry
zone and give rise to most Schwann cells
in the dorsal roots and DRGs (Coulpier
et al., 2009; Hjerling-Lefﬂer et al., 2005;
Topilko et al., 1994). Therefore, BC cells
might be the embryonic neuroﬁbroma tu-
mor cells of origin. However since Krox20
is a marker of BC cells and both Krox20+;
Nf1 / 
DNSCs could
give rise to sciatic plexiform neuroﬁ-
broma, this indicates that BC cells are un-
likely to be the cells of origin, but rather an
even earlier cell that is PLP+. To pheno-
typically characterize these PLP+ cells
of origin, we gavaged mother mice with

(Figure S2B). Further immunoﬂuorescence analyses demon-
strate that these embryonic nerve roots generated neurosphere
cells that express neural crest markers (Nestin and P75), imma-
ture Schwann cell marker GFAP, and proliferation marker Ki-67,

fate tracing prior to tumorigenesis. X-gal
staining demonstrates that LacZ+(PLP+)
cells are mainly located in nerve roots
at E10.5 when we gave 4-hydroxyta-
moxifen to pregnant mother mice at
E9.5 (Figure 3B). If these Nf1 ablated
LacZ+(PLP+) nerve root cells would
give rise to neuroﬁbroma, then neuroﬁ-
broma cells should carry the marker gene LacZ. Therefore,
we crossed PlpCre-ERT;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ male mice
with Nf1ﬂox/ ;R26R-LacZ female mice. We then administered
4-hydroxytamoxifen to pregnant mother mice for one dose at
E9.5. At 7 months of age, PlpCre-ERT;Nf1ﬂox/ ;R26R-LacZ
progenies from these crosses began to show classic signs
of
lethargy, weight loss, and paralyzed hind limbs.
We observed the presence of plexiform neuroﬁbromas with
strong positive X-gal staining in close proximity to the cervical
and thoracic DRGs (Figure 5A). Because PlpCre-ERT mediates
labeling solely at the time of tamoxifen administration at E9.5,
X-gal positive staining of neuroﬁbroma cells demonstrates
unambiguously that the labeled neuroﬁbromas were derived
from E9.5 PLP+ precursors in the embryonic nerve roots.
Histopathological analysis of
these tumors indicated that
the tumors exhibited cardinal features of plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas (Figure 5B). Strikingly, we also observed plexiform
neuroﬁbroma developed along the intercostal nerve whose
associated DRG appears histologically normal (Figure 5C). In
addition, we identiﬁed the earliest form of neuroﬁbroma exhib-
iting LacZ positive staining: classic pathological characteristics
of neuroﬁbroma and expressing Schwann cell marker S100b
and GAP43 at the dorsal nerve roots near the DRG (Figure 5D).
Together, these ﬁndings point to the PLP+;GAP43+ SCPs in
the embryonic nerve roots as the cells of origin for plexiform
neuroﬁbroma.

express neuronal marker bIII-tubulin (Figure 4Af). Strikingly,
every YFP+(PLP+) cell also expressed GAP43, a Schwann cell
marker that is known to ﬁrst appear at the precursor stage (Fig-
ures 4Ag–4Ai), and Sox10, a marker for neural crest origin and
future Schwann cell lineage (Figure S3A) (Kalcheim and Rohrer,
2014). Because these PLP+GAP43+ cells are also P75 positive
but S100b negative, they are at Schwann cell precursor stage
(Jessen and Mirsky, 2005). It is well known that cell culture
in vitro may vary from that in vivo. Therefore, we also character-
ized these PLP+ cells in E13.5 PlpCre-ERT;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-YFP
embryos and observed that YFP+(PLP+) cells were colocalized
with GAP43 mainly at nerve roots (Figures 4Ba–4Bc). Similar to
our in vitro data, they also expressed Nestin, P75, BLBP, and
Sox10 (Figures 4Bd–4Bf; Figure S3B). They were also colocal-
ized with bIII-tubulin (Figure 4Bg). However, they did not express
GFAP and S100b in vivo (Figures 4Bh and 4Bi). These ﬁndings
indicate that PLP+GAP43+ cells in the embryonic nerve roots
are SCPs and that they may be the elusive cells of origin for
para-spinal plexiform neuroﬁbroma.

A Robust Plexiform Neuroﬁbroma Model for Preclinical
Drug Screening
The Nf1 gene encodes for neuroﬁbromin, a Ras GTPase acti-
vating protein (GAP), and thus negatively regulates the RAS
signaling pathway (Rubin and Gutmann, 2005). This has promp-
ted the use of speciﬁc MAP Kinase pathway inhibitors to coun-
teract Nf1 loss-mediated tumor development (Chang et al.,
2013; Jessen et al., 2013; Staser et al., 2013) or to treat Nf1
mutant animals in the effort to restore abnormal brain develop-
ment and cognitive function (Li et al., 2012; Lush et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2012). To determine if our non-germline plexiform
neuroﬁbroma model could be used as a rapid preclinical thera-
peutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies, we
used a highly selective pharmacological
inhibitor of MEK,
PD0325901, which blocks activation and phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 (Chang et al., 2013), to test whether inhibition of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway can prevent neuroﬁbroma
progression in our plexiform neuroﬁbroma model.

In order to monitor the proliferation of tumor cells, we labeled
these neuroﬁbroma cells with Luciferase by crossing the
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ (Le et al., 2011) mice with Flox-stop-Flox

R26R-Luciferase mice to generate Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;R26R-LacZ-
Luciferase mice. We then harvested E13.5 DNSCs and infected
with Ad-CMV-Cre to generate Nf1 / ;R26R-LacZ-Luciferase
DNSCs. We transplanted these Nf1 / ;R26R-LacZ-Luciferase
DNSCs to sciatic nerves of nude mice to generate plexiform neu-
roﬁbromas. Mice were randomly assigned to PD0325901 treat-
ment (5 mg/kg/day, 5 day/week) or vehicle as a control group
(Figure 6A). We also tested if the MAPK pathway is activated in
our neuroﬁbromas and found that the ERK pathway is highly acti-
vated in the tumor tissues as shown by immunohistochemistry
analysis (Figure 6Ba). We then started the treatment right after
the transplantation. A striking reduction in luciferase signal was
observed even after only one week of PD0325901 treatment
(p < 0.01). Continued treatment of PD0325901 further inhibited
the proliferation of tumor cells. After 4 weeks of PD0325901
treatment, tumor cell proliferation was almost completely blunt-
ed as demonstrated by the diminishing luciferase signal. On the
other hand, the luciferase signal
in vehicle treatment group
increased more than 10 times after 4 weeks of treatment
(Figure 6Bb). These data suggested that the PD0325901 could
effectively inhibit the proliferation of plexiform neuroﬁbroma.

However,
it was not clear whether the inhibition effect of
PD0325901 would be sustained after stopping the PD0325901
treatment. To answer
this question, we divided the
PD0325901 treatment group into two subgroups: discontinued
PD0325901 treatment after 4 weeks or continued PD0325901
treatment for an additional 4 weeks in another group of mice.
Similar to this, we also divided the vehicle treatment group into
two subgroups based on continuing or discontinuing vehicle
treatment for another 4 weeks. We again used the luciferase
signal as a surrogate marker for tumor growth. We observed
that continued treatment of PD0325901 further blunted the pro-
liferation of neuroﬁbroma; however, they regained the prolifera-
tive capacity after PD0325901 withdrawal. Eight weeks after
transplantation of DNSCs, we sacriﬁced all mice and performed
X-gal staining of the sciatic nerves. Vehicle treatment groups
(8 weeks or 4 weeks) developed very large LacZ+ neuroﬁbromas,
4-week PD0325901 treatment dramatically reduced the growth
of neuroﬁbromas, while 8-week PD0325901 treatment almost
completely prevented the proliferation of neuroﬁbroma (Fig-
ure 6Bc; Figure S4). Consistently, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was
also reduced in both PD0325901 treatment groups compared
with vehicle treatment groups (Figure 6Bd). All of these data
showed the requirement of sustained Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling for neuroﬁbroma growth and that continuous
PD0325901 treatment is effective in restraining this growth.
Thus, our non-germline plexiform neuroﬁbroma model provides
a powerful approach for preclinical therapeutic drug screening to
identify effective therapies for human clinical trials to prevent
neuroﬁbroma formation in NF1 patients, where none exist today.

DISCUSSION

Recent progress in cancer research points to the importance of
stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation and
maintenance of many tumors, consistent with the notion that
these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursor cells
and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors (Alcan-
tara Llaguno et al., 2009; Barker et al., 2009; Bonnet and Dick,
1997; Chen et al., 2012a; Goldstein et al., 2010; Le et al., 2009;
Reya et al., 2001; Tysnes, 2010). Identifying which cell type gives
rise to a particular cancer (the cells of origin) will permit greater
understanding of their pathogenesis and inform better design
approaches for their treating. In this study, we utilized a geneti-
cally engineered mouse model as a tool to identify the cells of
origin for plexiform neuroﬁbroma. Using cell lineage tracing, we
demonstrated that the embryonic PLP+;Nf1 /  SCPs, which
originate from spinal nerve roots, give rise to plexiform neuroﬁ-
broma not only in para-spinal areas but also in distal peripheral
nerve. We also report a non-germline model for plexiform neuro-
ﬁbroma that can be used broadly as preclinical models for ther-
apeutic testing.

A large body of direct and indirect studies has provided evi-
dence that Nf1 gene deletion is the requisite initial step that pre-
cedes neuroﬁbromagenesis (Joseph et al., 2008; Le et al., 2009;
Wu et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2002). Cichowski
et al. (1999) addressed this issue elegantly when they generated
chimeric mice by injecting LacZ+ Nf1 / 
ES cells into wild-type
blastocysts. These mice developed microscopic neuroﬁbromas
derived from the injected ES cells, demonstrating the requirement

of Nf1 homozygosity for tumor formation (Cichowski et al., 1999).
However, the extent of chimerism in these mice occurs randomly
and cannot be controlled genetically. As a result, it is difﬁcult to
establish the cells of origin for these tumors. Conditional deletion
of Nf1 from embryonic neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) using Wnt-
1-Cre transgenic mice leads to a transient increase in NCSC
frequency and self-renewal, but the isolated NCSCs fail to form
tumors upon transplantation (Joseph et al., 2008), suggesting
that early NCSC derivatives may not contain potential cells of
origin for plexiform neuroﬁbroma. This observation indicates
that later NCSC derivatives give rise to plexiform neuroﬁbromas.
Consistently, ablation of Nf1 in Schwann cells using P0A-Cre;
Nf1ﬂox/ 
or Dhh-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice, which deletes Nf1 continu-
ously from early SCPs through mature cells, efﬁciently induce
neuroﬁbromas development (Wu et al., 2008; Zheng et al.,
2008). However, the Cre recombinase transgenes used in these
two studies compromise Nf1 function at the early Schwann cell
stages of development (at E12.5), and the Cre recombinase activ-
ity persists through the mature Schwann cell stage. Therefore, it is
not possible to identify or exclude any particular Schwann cell
developmental stage as the critical one for Nf1 loss-mediated tu-
mor development. The interpretation of the data instead rests on
correlations relating to detectable appearance of abnormal cells
or structures. An alternative approach that can in theory provide
a more precise evaluation of the evolution of NF1-associated
tumors is the application of inducible Cre/loxP technology that al-
lows temporal and spatial ablation of NF1 function in Schwann
cells. Two different studies show that acute loss of Nf1 in both em-
bryo and adult can lead to plexiform neuroﬁbroma formation (Le
et al., 2011; Mayes et al., 2011). The fact that Nf1 inactivation in
adult mice also gives rise to neuroﬁbroma, albeit at a much lower
frequency (Le et al., 2011),
indicates that either (1) mature
Schwann cells can, in rare cases, give rise to neuroﬁbroma or
(2) that rare populations of progenitor cells persist within the adult
peripheral nervous system.

The notion that mature Schwann cells have the capability to
give rise to plexiform neuroﬁbromas is less evident. NF1 patients
rarely present with plexiform tumors for the ﬁrst time as adults
(Ferner, 2007). As aforementioned, Schwann cell development
and terminal differentiation into myelinating cells mostly occurs
postnatally. If mature Schwann cells as a whole can give rise
to neuroﬁbromas when loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurs in
adulthood, then it would be anticipated that plexiform tumors
should develop widely in PlpCre-ERT mice induced postnatally
since Cre-mediated recombination remains efﬁcient in mature
Schwann cells. It is not likely that the Schwann cell lineage un-
dergoes immature to mature transition en masse at tightly
deﬁned times from the NCSC stage, to the precursor stage, to
the immature stage, and onward to more differentiated stages.
Instead, gradients of cells transition and migrate over extended
periods with considerable overlap between the disappearance
of one population and the emergence of another. Therefore, re-
maining compartments of precursor Schwann cells may also
persist into adulthood and retain the capacity to form plexiform
neuroﬁbromas within the peripheral nerves.
Indeed, given
that embryonic nerve roots associate tightly with DRGs and
that
the harvested DRGs almost always contaminate with
nerve roots, we carefully separated out the early embryonic
dorsal nerve roots from the DRGs for neurosphere culture.

Unexpectedly, we found that only the embryonic dorsal nerve
roots could robustly give rise to neurosphere but not the E13.5
DRGs. However, in adult mice, we found that the DRGs can
give rise to neurospheres and neuroﬁbroma when Nf1 was abla-
ted and implanted into the sciatic nerves (data not shown).
Consistently, when we acutely labeled the PLP+ precursor cells
with LacZ only in nerve roots at E10.5, we also observed plexi-
form neuroﬁbroma developed in the peripheral nerve distal to
the DRG. All of the data suggest that at least some of the cells
of origin might migrate out along the nerve roots-DRG-peripheral
nerve and retain the capacity to form neuroﬁbroma later in life.
In the conditional knockout model using Cre/loxP technology,
the Krox20-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice (containing Nf1 / 
Schwann cells
and Nf1+/+ microenvironment) do not develop neuroﬁbromas. On
the other hand, the Krox20-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/ 
mice (containing Nf1 / 
Schwann cells and Nf1+/ 
microenvironment) develop plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (Zhu et al., 2002), demonstrating the essential
role for the heterozygous environment in the development of
neuroﬁbroma. In another mouse model, a more robust Dhh-Cre
driver causes plexiform neuroﬁbroma formation in an Nf1-wild-
type background (Wu et al., 2008). In the current study, the PLP+;
Nf1 / 
DNSCs could also effectively give rise to plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas when transplanted into the sciatic nerves of nude mice,
which also have an Nf1-wild-type background. It is important to
emphasize here that under these conditions, a large group of
SCPs undergoes Nf1 LOH simultaneously and can therefore vie
with the wild-type environment more efﬁciently than when only
one or a very few isolated SCPs undergo LOH. In NF1 patients
that harbor germline heterozygous NF1 mutations, given the
deﬁned time of gestation and size of neural crest compartment,
inactivation of the other normal NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage
must be rare and stochastic, such that single cells undergo
completely inactivation of NF1 in a large pool of otherwise hetero-
zygous NF1 mutant cells. In this setting, the increased secretion
of SCF or other factors from heterozygous cells, including mast
cells, in the tumor microenvironment provides a permissive con-
dition to foster tumor growth (Yang et al., 2008). Therefore, in the
experimental setting, one possible advantage of having a large
pool of precursors undergoing LOH would be a rapid and dra-
matic increase in cytokine and growth factor secretion that could
be sufﬁcient to elicit wild-type mast cells without the need for the
hypersensitive heterozygous state of the latter. As such, in the
physiologic scenario, one would envision a rare Schwann cell
undergoing LOH that would normally disappear except for the
response of the Nf1-heterozygous microenvironment that assists
it to form a tumor. In another scenario, contribution of a multitude
of cells that have undergone LOH may override the otherwise
requisite contributions from other factors, such as heterozygous
mast cells or other cells in the microenvironment, to induce
neuroﬁbroma development.

Although the tumor microenvironment is critical for neuroﬁ-
broma formation (Le et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2008), intrinsic pro-
liferative signals such as those in the MAPK pathways are equally
essential. Therefore, both the tumor microenvironment and
MAPK pathways have been targeted in the preclinical setting
to deﬁne clinically relevant pharmacodynamic variables and
evaluating duration of drug effects on individual tumor (Jessen
et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2008). The purpose of preclinical drug
screening is to select the most effective and safe compound

from a large library. Our non-germline model for plexiform neuro-
ﬁbroma enables high efﬁciency of tumorigenesis and has a much
shorter latency. Therefore, it is a reliable and robust model for
in vivo drug screening with a quantiﬁable and reproducible
outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead com-
pounds for clinical assessment. In addition, the ability to isolate
embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1
ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neuroﬁbromas al-
lows ﬂexible and speedy manipulation with multiple genetic tools
to delineate additional pathways that are perturbed upon the
loss of Nf1, which are essential for neuroﬁbroma development.
In conclusion, the identity of the tumor cells of origin and the
facility for isolation and expansion for genetic alterations provide
fertile ground for continued analysis to identify additional intrinsic
and extrinsic factors within the tumor microenvironment that
likely play essential roles in neuroﬁbroma genesis. It is reason-
able to speculate that lessons learned from investigating the mo-
lecular interactions between the neuroﬁbroma cells of origin and
their microenvironment will provide us approaches to develop
effective therapies to delay and possibly prevent neuroﬁbroma
formation in NF1 patients.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Mice
Animal care and use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The
Nf1ﬂox/ 
and Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice have been described previously (Zhu et al.,
2002). For conditional ablation of Nf1, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre
line, the PlpCre-ERT2 transgenic mice (Leone et al., 2003), and two non-induc-
ible Cre lines, Krox20-Cre and Dhh-Cre (Limpert et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2002).
The Rosa26-YFP reporter mice were described previously (Chen et al., 2009).
The ROSA26-lacZ and ROSA26-Luciferase reporter mice were obtained
from the Jackson Laboratories.

Tamoxifen and 4-Hydroxytamoxifen Induction
Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen was dissolved in a
sunﬂower oil/ethanol mixture (9:1) at 10 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml, respectively.
For embryonic induction, the pregnant mice were gavaged orally with 1 mg
of tamoxifen or 0.2 mg of 4-hydroxytamoxifen at E11.5 or E9.5, respectively.

Cell Culture and Differentiation Assays
Mouse embryos were removed from anesthetized 13.5-day-old pregnant
female mice. Embryos were sacriﬁced. The spinal cord of each embryo was
removed, and DRGs/nerve roots were dissected from the vertebral column
with the aid of stereomicroscope. Fine scissors was used to cut and separate
the nerve roots and DRGs. DRG and/or nerve root neurosphere culture was
performed as previously described (Le et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2014; Ratner
et al., 2006). For cell proliferation assay, the single sphere cells were seeded
to a 6-well plate coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin (4.0 3 103 cells per well)
for monolayer culture. The cell numbers of 3 wells were counted every 24 hr
for 5 days. For differentiation assays, we seeded 5.0 3 103 cells per well of
an 8-chamber slide coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin and cultured with fresh
media containing B27 + 5% fetal bovine serum for 7–14 days. Then we ﬁxed
the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and performed immunostaining
for lineage markers.

Transplantation Experiments
Sciatic nerve implantation of DNSCs was performed as previously reported
(Chen et al., 2012b). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injec-
tion of 120 ml of a mixture of ketamine (10 mg/ml) and xylazine (1 mg/ml) solu-
tion. A skin incision was made above the femur. Using iris scissors, a pocket
was created within the quadriceps muscles to expose the sciatic nerve. The
40 ml of L15 medium containing 1 3 106 viable DNSCs was then deposited
into this pocket so that DNSCs can be in contact with the SN. The quadriceps
muscles were then closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed
with 5-0 prolene suture. Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia, then
subject to MEK Inhibitor treatment and bioluminescent imaging.

MEK Inhibitor Treatment
MEK inhibitor PD0325901 were kindly provided by Dr. Kevin Shannon.
PD0325901 was dissolved in vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
with 0.2% Tween 80; Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The
solution was administered orally at the dosage of 5 mg/kg (body weight) per
mouse, once per day, for 5 days/week.

Bioluminescent Imaging
Bioluminescent imaging was performed as described previously (Chau et al.,
2014). Brieﬂy, mice were injected with 160 ul 20 mg/ml D-Luciferin Potassium
Salt (Perkin Elmer) in 0.9% sterile NaCl, and total ﬂux was quantiﬁed using IVIS
Lumina II (Caliper Life Sciences) weekly.

Statistics
All data are displayed as the mean ± SEM unless speciﬁed otherwise. A
two-tailed t test and Fisher exact test were applied as appropriate to evaluate
statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05 was deemed statistically signiﬁcant).
