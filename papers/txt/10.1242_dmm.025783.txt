ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder
characterized by the occurrence of nerve sheath tumors and
considerable clinical heterogeneity. Some translational studies
have been limited by the lack of animal models available for
assessing patient-specific mutations. In order to test therapeutic
approaches that might restore function to the mutated gene or
gene product, we developed mice harboring NF1 patient-specific
mutations including a nonsense mutation (c.2041C>T; p.Arg681*)
and a missense mutation (c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg). The latter
is associated with the development of multiple plexiform
neurofibromas along spinal nerve roots. We demonstrate that the
human nonsense NF1Arg681* and missense NF1Gly848Arg mutations
have different effects on neurofibromin expression in the mouse
and each recapitulates unique aspects of
the NF1 phenotype,
depending upon the genetic context when assessed in the
homozygous state or when paired with a conditional knockout
allele. Whereas the missense Nf1Gly848Arg mutation fails to produce
an overt phenotype in the mouse, animals homozygous for the
nonsense Nf1Arg681* mutation are not viable. Mice with one
Nf1Arg681* allele in combination with a conditional
floxed Nf1
allele and the DhhCre transgene (Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre) display
disorganized nonmyelinating axons and neurofibromas along the
spinal column, which leads to compression of the spinal cord and
paralysis. This model will be valuable for preclinical
testing of
novel nonsense suppression therapies using drugs to target
in-frame point mutations that
create premature termination
codons in individuals with NF1.

INTRODUCTION
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder
affecting ∼1 in 3000 individuals and over two million people
worldwide (Friedman, 1999; Evans et al., 2010). NF1 is
characterized principally by the occurrence of neurofibromas and
café-au-lait macules (CALMs) (Boyd et al., 2009). Both children
and adults with NF1 are at an increased risk for developing certain
malignancies and display an assortment of benign and malignant
lesions
plexiform),
pheochromocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, optic gliomas, bone
abnormalities, leukemias and malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (Boyd et al., 2009). NF1 is caused by inherited or de novo
pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene, whereas tumor development
requires additional mutation of the other NF1 allele (loss of
heterozygosity) (Garcia-Linares et al., 2011; Steinmann et al.,
2009). To date, no strong genotype-phenotype correlation has been
established for NF1 because of the varied disease expression
observed in humans. Many individuals with NF1, even from the
same family, show differences in the presentation or severity of the
NF1 phenotype (Pasmant et al., 2012; Alkindy et al., 2012; Sabbagh
et al., 2009). This is exemplified by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) diagnostic criteria for NF1, which require a minimum of two
of the following: six or more CALMs, two or more cutaneous
neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma, axillary or inguinal
freckling, optic pathway glioma, two or more Lisch nodules, bony
dysplasia, or a first degree relative with NF1 (Ferner et al., 2007).
Furthermore, there are few in vitro assays available to examine
neurofibromin function, which is especially problematic when
trying to assess the potential pathogenicity of missense variants.

Several mouse models have been developed that display some of
the phenotypes seen in individuals with NF1, including learning
difficulties, as well as the development of plexiform neurofibromas,
optic gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (Boyd
et al., 2009). These existing animal models generally employ
conditional knockout strategies that lead to loss of function of
one or both Nf1 alleles, which have proven to be valuable tools
to investigate the pathogenesis of NF1, and to evaluate several
therapeutic strategies such as inhibitors of RAS or intercellular
signaling (Yang et al., 2008; Robertson et al., 2012; Jessen et al.,
2013). However, the underlying mutations used in current animal
models are not sufficient to evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to
target
including nonsense
suppression and exon-skipping therapies. These therapies have been
established in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis (Du
et al., 2002, 2006; De Luca et al., 2008; Loufrani et al., 2004;

Aartsma-Rus et al., 2003; Igreja et al., 2016). Thus, the use of
NF1 mouse models harboring mutations identified in individuals
with NF1 provides the ability to perform prospective investigations
targeting a specific underlying mutation or mutation type.

To this end, we created and characterized two novel mouse models
harboring mutations found in individuals with NF1, including a
common nonsense mutation (nmNF1, exon 18 c.2041C>T;
p.Arg681*) expected to produce complete loss of function, and a
recurring missense mutation found in individuals with NF1
associated with multiple plexiform neurofibromas along spinal
nerve roots (exon 21 c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg). We demonstrate
that
c.2041C>T; p.Arg681* (hereafter called
Nf1Arg681*) and missense c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg (hereafter
called Nf1Gly848Arg) mutations in the mouse have different effects
on neurofibromin expression, and each recapitulates unique aspects of
NF1 depending upon the genetic context when assessed in the
homozygous state, or when paired with a conditional knockout allele.

RESULTS
Establishing mouse models with NF1 patient mutations
Nonsense mutations make up ∼20% of characterized mutations
(Messiaen and Wimmer, 2008). The Medical Genomics Laboratory
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham has identified 19 of the
most recurrent nonsense mutations found in individuals with NF1
(each responsible for at least 0.3% of NF1 cases). Among those is a
nonsense mutation in exon 18, c.2041C>T; p.Arg681* observed
in 49/8000 unrelated NF1-mutation-positive probands (0.61%). Of
39 individuals with phenotypic data available, 15 individuals were
0-2 years of age at the time of testing (mostly too young to fulfill
clinical diagnostic criteria). Within these individuals, 2/15 fulfill
NIH criteria with 2/15 individuals having <6 CALMs. The
remaining 24 individuals are ≥3 years of age and all fulfill NIH
criteria for NF1 diagnosis; although none possess symptomatic
spinal neurofibromas (including half who were ≥19 years old), 8/24
individuals did have an externally visible plexiform neurofibroma.
In contrast, a missense mutation located in exon 21 (c.2542G>C;
p.Gly848Arg), observed in 11/7800 unrelated NF1-mutation-
positive probands (0.14%), is associated with symptomatic spinal
nerve root
tumors. Phenotypic data were obtained from 20
individuals from four different
families with a p.Gly848Arg
mutation. Three of these individuals are 0-2 years of age, with 1/3
fulfilling the NIH criteria and 2/3 having <6 CALMs, whereas 7/17
of the individuals aged ≥3 years fulfill the NIH criteria, with 4/17
having an externally visible plexiform neurofibroma. Symptomatic
spinal nerve root tumors were found in 6/17 individuals, including
5/8 individuals who were ≥19 years old. For individuals 19 years or
older, there is a significant difference in the frequency of spinal
nerve root tumors between the c.2041C>T (0/12) vs c.2542G>A
(5/8) mutation (2-tailed Fisher exact: P=0.0036).

To model each human mutation in the mouse, knock-in animals
harboring the nonsense c.2041C>T; p.Arg681* mutation allele in
exon 18 (Nf1Arg681*) and the missense c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg
mutation allele in exon 21 (Nf1Gly848Arg) were created using
conventional gene-targeting vectors and C57BL/6 embryonic
stem cells, with chimeric mice and germ line transmission being
confirmed (Table S1). Since the Nf1-floxed animals that have been
used in previous studies were generated on a mixed genetic
background (Zhu et al., 2002), we obtained mice from the
International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) harboring a
‘knockout first’ allele for the Nf1 gene (Nf1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi) in order
to have all Nf1 alleles on the inbred C57BL/6 background. We
generated a new conditional knockout ‘floxed’ allele of the Nf1 gene

760

where exon 4 is flanked by loxP sites (hereafter referred to as Nf14F)
after removal of the FRT-flanked LacZ/Neo cassettes by breeding to
a FLP-recombinase line. Matings between heterozygous Nf1+/4F
mice yielded homozygous floxed Nf14F/4F mice at the expected
Mendelian ratio that were viable, fertile and did not show gross or
histological abnormalities (data not shown). Heterozygous Nf1+/Δ4
mice harboring a null allele resulting from exon 4 deletion were
created by breeding Nf1+/4F mice to an EIIaCre driver line [B6.
FVB-Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd/J strain #003724], thereby deleting
the floxed sequence in all cells within the developing embryos.

Nonsense mutation NF1Arg681* recapitulated in the mouse is
non-functional
Previous studies have demonstrated that mouse embryos fail to
develop beyond embryonic day (E)13.5 in the absence of Nf1
expression as a result of cardiovascular defects (Jacks et al., 1994;
Brannan et al., 1994). To determine the functionality of each allele,
we performed intercross breedings of Nf1+/Arg681* and Nf1+/Δ4 mice
and examined embryos from E9.5 to E13.5. Embryos heterozygous
for either the Nf1Arg681* or the Nf1Δ4 allele were viable and
developed to term with no observable defects. At E9.5, all
homozygous Nf1Arg681*/Arg681*
embryos were
indistinguishable from their littermate controls; however, these
homozygous embryos fail to develop past this point (Fig. S2).
Although Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* mice display pericardial effusions at
E10.5 (Fig. 1A,B), we were unable to ascertain the exact cause of
death because of extensive tissue degradation.

and Nf1Δ4/Δ4

To assess neurofibromin function in these models, we isolated
and expanded mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from E9.5
embryos carrying different allelic mutations, and performed
western blot analyses. Neurofibromin was completely absent in
Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* and Nf1Δ4/Δ4 MEFs, and was markedly reduced
in Nf1+/Arg681* and Nf1+/Δ4 MEFs (Fig. 1C,D). Neurofibromin
negatively regulates Ras signaling by accelerating conversion of
activated Ras-GTP
in
hyperactivation of phosphorylated ERK (pERK). We therefore
compared pERK levels in wild-type, Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* and Nf1Δ4/Δ4
MEFs derived from E9.5 embryos, and observed significant
elevations in pERK levels in Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* and Nf1Δ4/Δ4
(Fig. 1E,F).

Nonsense mutations create premature termination codons (PTCs)
in genes that in turn trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay
(NMD) to selectively and rapidly degrade PTC-bearing aberrant
transcripts. To determine if Nf1Arg681* mutations induce NMD, we
compared levels of wild-type versus mutant mRNA in Nf1+/Arg681*
mice. It is expected that in the absence of NMD, the percentage ratio
of mutant to wild-type mRNA would be 50:50; however, if NMD
were occurring, the distribution of mRNA would be skewed. RNA
was extracted from brain tissues of Nf1+/Arg681* mice and reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed
using primer sets flanking the nonsense mutation. The amplicons
were then cloned into a TA vector for sequencing. Of twenty-two
clones sequenced, only two (9.1%) were identified with the
Nf1Arg681* mutation whereas the remaining twenty clones (90.9%)
contained wild-type

the novel Nf1Δ4 alleles significantly ablate Nf1 gene expression and
function.

In the appropriate genetic context, the Nf1Arg681* mutation
induces neurofibroma formation in mice
As described above, individuals with NF1 harboring nonsense
NF1Arg681* mutations may develop plexiform neurofibromas;
therefore, we hypothesized that we could recapitulate this
phenotype in Nf1Arg681* mice in the appropriate genetic context.
Using conditional knockout models, it has been established that
neurofibroma development can be stimulated through Nf1 loss of
heterozygosity within the Schwann cell lineage when driven by
Cre recombinase expression (Wu et al., 2008). To investigate
whether
can induce
neurofibroma development in vivo, we generated two conditional
knockout NF1 mouse models employing a DhhCre transgenic
mouse line. In this model system, Cre recombinase is expressed
from desert hedgehog regulatory sequences at E12.5, with
previous demonstration that
the Nf1 gene in
Nf131&32F/31&32F; DhhCre mice (with exons 31 and 32 flanked by
loxP sites) elicits the formation of plexiform and subcutaneous
neurofibromas (Wu et al., 2008).

We bred the Nf1+/Arg681*, Nf14F/4F and DhhCre mice and
generated Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre mice (Fig. 2A) as well as
Nf14F/4F; DhhCre mice. Consistent with previous studies, both
Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre and Nf14F/4F; DhhCre mice were viable and
indistinguishable from their littermate controls at birth. However,
we began to observe paralysis in one or both hind limbs in
animals from both models at approximately four months of age.
By five months of age, 55.6% (30/54) of our initial cohort of
Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre mice exhibited paralysis, whereas 54.1%
(13/24) of Nf14F/4F; DhhCre mice were paralyzed at the same
age. In addition to paralysis, these mice also developed other
symptoms including lethargy, weight
loss, dermatitis and/or
dehydration.

To determine the source of the paralysis, we performed gross
dissection of each Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre or Nf14F/4F; DhhCre
mouse. Tumors were observed in 81.5% (44/54) of Nf14F/Arg681*;
DhhCre and 79.2% (19/24) of Nf14F/4F; DhhCre mice. All
paralyzed mice were found to have visible tumors arising at the
dorsal root ganglia resulting in compression of the spinal cord.
Gross tumor numbers ranged from one to thirteen per mouse, with
90.9% detected in the cervical or thoracic spine and 9.1% detected
in the lumbar spine (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3A). These tumors seemed to arise
around the dorsal root ganglia, with invasion of the neural foramen,
leading to compression of the spinal cord. In addition to these
lesions, we also observed enlarged spinal nerve roots and peripheral
nerves in the mice examined (data not shown). Thus, Nf14F/Arg681*;
DhhCre mice develop neurofibromas with high efficiency.

Upon histological analysis, neurofibromas are characterized by
disorganized Remak bundles (the non-myelinated axon-Schwann
cell unit) and enriched deposition of collagen. Similar lesions were
seen from tumor preparations of both models at the ultrastructural
level (Fig. 2C-F, Fig. 3B-D). These data indicate that Nf1Arg681*
functions as a null allele, and recapitulates key characteristics of
human disease in the proper genetic context.

Nf1Gly848Arg only partially impacts Nf1 gene function, and is

DISCUSSION
The factors that underlie the clinical heterogeneity seen in NF1 are
still unclear. Assessment of the functional and physiological
consequences of putative mutations is hampered by the lack of
robust
in vitro and in vivo assays, and limited knowledge of
neurofibromin protein domains. In this study, two animal models
were engineered to harbor NF1 mutations found in human patients,
specifically nmNF1 (nonsense c.2041C>T; p.Arg681*) and a
missense mutation of NF1 (missense c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg).
This approach is possible given the greater than 98% amino acid
sequence homology between the mouse and human neurofibromin
protein (Bernards et al., 1993). Within the regions encoded by exons
18 and 21, the protein sequence homology is 98% and 96%,
respectively (Fig. S3). The clinical features associated with these
mutations in humans are distinct. Individuals with a p.Gly848Arg
mutation suffer from multiple plexiform neurofibromas along the
spinal cord but a paucity of dermal neurofibromas, whereas
individuals with the c.2041C>T; p.Arg681* premature stop

Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg MEFs show ∼50% less protein than cells
from wild-type controls, which is similar to that observed in Nf1+/Δ4
samples (Fig. 4B). In response to neurofibromin reduction, pERK is
hyperactivated in Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg MEFs to a level comparable
with Nf1+/Δ4 samples, suggestive of
increased Ras activity
(Fig. 4C,D). Therefore, Nf1Gly848Arg only partially decreases Nf1
gene expression in mouse. Given that spinal neurofibromas form the
primary manifestation of this mutation in humans, we examined the
spinal nerve roots of Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg mice by electron
microscopy for ultrastructural abnormalities. Neither myelinated
nor non-myelinated axons were disrupted when compared with
controls. (Fig. 4E,F).

Individuals with NF1 carry second (somatic) mutations that are
distinct from germline mutations. We hypothesized that Nf1Gly848Arg
mice carrying a second null mutation in Nf1 might develop
neurofibromas, which we tested by generating Nf1Δ4/Gly848Arg mice.
Similar to Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg mice, these animals were viable and
displayed no overt phenotype. We monitored ten Nf1Δ4/Gly848Arg
mice for up to twenty-four months and still were unable to find
tumors. Therefore, we conclude that

mutation also have dermal and plexiform neurofibromas but do not
have multiple spinal nerve root tumors.

Examining the effects of these two different NF1 mutations in
mouse models, we would like to make four points. Firstly, the two
mutations have distinct effects on embryonic development and
neurofibromin expression in the mouse. The Nf1Arg681* allele
functions as a null allele with complete loss of Nf1 function,
whereas Nf1Gly848Arg appears to retain some function. The
Nf1Arg681* allele is embryonic lethal when homozygous, whereas
Nf1Gly848Arg homozygous animals are viable. In accordance with
embryonic lethality, complete ablation of neurofibromin expression
was observed in Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* cells whereas neurofibromin
expression in the Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg MEFs was reduced by
∼50%. Our data are consistent with a previous study on iPS cells
and fibroblasts from individuals with NF1, which demonstrated that
different germline NF1 mutations result in different degrees of
neurofibromin expression (Anastasaki et al., 2015). However,
in vitro analyses showed increases in pERK in MEFs from both
homozygotes when compared with wild-type. This is comparable
with what has been observed in neural progenitor cells from
individuals with NF1, as individual NF1 mutations did not
differentially affect Ras activation (Anastasaki et al., 2015). The
observed changes in pERK suggest that the Nf1Gly848Arg allele could
potentially function as a hypomorphic allele, though further studies
would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

Secondly, the Nf1Gly848Arg allele failed to recapitulate the NF1
phenotype; whereas humans with NF1 suffer from multiple spinal
plexiform neurofibromas,
the mouse did not display an overt
tumorigenic phenotype. A possible explanation for this discrepancy
is the presence of modifier genes in the mouse impeding

mice. Similar observations were made in a parallel study where the
same Nf1Arg681* allele in a different mouse model
led to
development of optic gliomas, but these tumors were not seen in
Nf1Gly848Arg mice (Toonen et al., 2016).

Thirdly,

the Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre model displays a robust
tumor phenotype, with 81.5% of animals grossly developing
neurofibromas throughout their lifetime. Previous studies using the
Nf131&32F/31&32F; DhhCre model
indicated that mice became
paralyzed in one or both hind limbs in 28.6% of animals by
six months of age (Wu et al., 2008); however, our data with the
Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre model reveals an earlier onset of paralysis
with tumorigenesis at 5 months of age in 55.6% of mice. These
differences may either stem from the Nf1Arg681* allele, which
provides a suitable environment for neurofibroma development, or
from the conditional knockout of exon four versus the previously
described exon 31 and 32, as the Nf14F/4F; DhhCre mice also appear
to exhibit higher penetrance than the existing Nf131&32F/31&32F;
DhhCre model. This hypothesis is further supported by the notable
differences in embryonic lethality between the Nf1Δ4 allele,
Nf1Arg681* and the previously published Nf131&32F allele. As
previously reported, embryonic death of Nf1Δ31&32/Δ31&32 animals
occurred from E11.5 to E13.5 as a result of defects in cardiac
development (Jacks et al., 1994; Brannan et al., 1994). However,
all
or
Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* died around E10. Additionally, a parallel study
observed that optic gliomas from mice harboring the Nf1Arg681*
allele are more aggressive than those developing in mice with the
traditional Nf1Δ31&32/Δ31&32 mutation, with more microglia and
increased proliferative indices (Toonen et al., 2016). While it is
difficult to make direct comparisons and draw conclusions across
these studies because of the difference in null alleles utilized,
collectively these data suggest the Nf1Δ4 and Nf1Arg681* alleles
might yield a more severe phenotype.

Another possibility for

the observed differences between
Nf14F/4F; DhhCre and Nf131&32F/31&32F; DhhCre mice lies in the
strains utilized in these studies; all mice in our experiments are on an
inbred C57BL/6 background whereas previous studies used mice on
a mixed 129/C57BL/6 background (Wu et al., 2008). Furthermore,

in all somatic cells. Of note,
the neurofibromas arising in
Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre mice occur in a divergent location when
compared with their human counterparts, as these animals develop
tumors along the spinal column, whereas symptomatic spinal
neurofibromas were absent in humans. This is likely due to the
DhhCre driver line, which specifically promotes tumorigenesis
along the spinal column per previous models (Wu et al., 2008).

Fourthly, there is a great need to develop non-surgical treatments
for NF1 patients. To date, most therapeutic interventions that have
been tested in preclinical models or clinical
trials have been
designed to regulate the downstream targets in the Ras signaling
pathway or
intercellular communication (Yang et al., 2008;
Robertson et al., 2012; Jessen et al., 2013). Few studies have
focused on restoring function of the defective NF1 alleles. The

development of mutation-guided therapeutics provides new
opportunities for treatment of NF1 caused by specific mutations.
The robust phenotype of the nmNF1 mouse model and its parallels
to human phenotype indicate that Nf14F/Arg681*; DhhCre mice will
provide a valuable system for evaluating new therapies targeting the
causative genetic mutation, such as nonsense suppression therapies.
Nonsense mutations comprise ∼20% of mutations in individuals
with NF1 (Messiaen and Wimmer, 2008). For other diseases,
therapies (gentamicin, PTC124 and other compounds) have been
developed that can suppress nonsense mutations to restore partial
protein activity, with some now being used clinically (Du et al.,
2002; Keeling et al., 2013; Sangkuhl et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007;
Guerin et al., 2008; Zilberberg et al., 2010). Assessment of
nonsense suppression therapy in vivo is absolutely required prior to
its assessment in individuals with nmNF1. Currently, premature
stop mutation mouse models for other genes are being used to
evaluate nonsense suppression therapy, including the Idua-W392X
mouse model of human Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis
type I-H) and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
model (Zhang et al., 2014; Gunn et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012).

suppression therapy approaches.

the Nf1Arg681*

In summary, we have engineered and characterized the first NF1
patient-based germ line NF1 mutations modeled in mice,
establishing that
allele profoundly reduces
neurofibromin expression and leads to plexiform neurofibroma
formation. This study provides clear evidence that different
mutations in NF1 can have unique consequences, and the
germline mutation is an important factor underlying NF1 clinical
heterogeneity. Further preclinical and translational studies of
nonsense
suppression therapy are underway utilizing the
Nf1Arg681* allele. Future investigations of additional NF1 models
harboring other human patient mutations will be used to better
understand the NF1 phenotype, and will serve as translational
models for therapeutic studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study approval
The patient data was collected after approval of a human subjects protocol
(F080926009, Further Research on Samples Submitted for Molecular
Genetic Testing) by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham. All animal experiments were conducted after
approval of an animal protocol (APN 130109835, Translational NF1 Mouse
Models) by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Generation of Nf1Arg681* and Nf1Gly848Arg mouse lines
We synthesized two targeting constructs that each contained a point
mutation recapitulating human variant c.2041C>T; p.Arg681* (Nf1Arg681*)
or c.2542G>C; p.Gly848Arg (Nf1Gly848Arg), a FRT-flanked neomycin
selection cassette, and extended 5′ flanking regions homologous to intron 17
or 20, respectively (Genscript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) (Fig. S1). The truncated
versions of the two constructs were introduced into C57BL/6N-tac ES cells
(PRX-B6N Primogenix, Laurie, MO) with correctly targeted clones
identified by unique PCR fragments. Targeted clones were injected into
blastocysts to generate chimeric founder animals that subsequently passed
on the targeted alleles to offspring. The excision of the FRT-flanked
neomycin cassette was carried out by breeding to a ubiquitously expressing
FLP transgene mouse line [B6.129S4-Gt(Rosa)26Sortm1(FLP1),
the
Jackson Laboratory, #009086]. The new Nf1 alleles were designated as
Nf1Arg681* and Nf1Gly848Arg. Mice harboring the ‘knockout first NF1 allele
(Nf1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi) were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
and bred to FLP mice [B6.129S4-Gt(Rosa)26Sortm1(FLP1), the Jackson
Laboratory, #009086] to remove the FRT-flanked lacZ-Neo cassettes to
produce animals with a conditional knockout allele of the NF1 gene with
exon 4 flanked by loxP sites (i.e. Nf1tm1c, hereafter referred to as Nf14F).

Mouse breeding
All animals were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background using a
temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium on a 12 h dark-light cycle
with free access to food and water. All homozygous Nf1Gly848Arg/Gly848Arg
and Nf14F/4F mice were viable, fertile and did not display any detectable
embryonic and postnatal phenotypes. Equal numbers of male and female
animals were analyzed throughout the study. Nf1Arg681*/Arg681* and Nf1Δ4/Δ4
embryos failed to develop beyond E9.5. A DhhCre transgenic mouse line
[FVB(Cg)-Tg(Dhh-cre)1Mejr/J] was kindly provided by Dr Dies Meijer
(Erasmus University Medical Center, Netherlands) to breed with the Nf14F/4F
and Nf1+/Arg681* strains. Cre-negative Nf14F/Arg681* or Nf14F/4F littermates
were used for controls. For analysis of embryos, we established timed
matings, E0.5 was designated as noon of the day a vaginal plug was detected.

MEF generation & culture
To generate MEFs, embryos were isolated in cold PBS and the heads and
visceral organs were removed. Each embryo was minced into small pieces in
trypsin solution and placed at 37°C for 5-10 min. The trypsin solution was

then neutralized with two volumes of MEF medium (10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum in DMEM). After centrifugation, the supernatant was
discarded and the pellet resuspended in fresh MEF medium. The cell
suspensions were seeded onto gelatin-coated culture vessels, and incubated
at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a culture incubator until the cells were confluent and
ready for passage. These cells were designated as passage zero (P0), only
those P4 or less were used in the study.

Western blot analysis
Frozen MEFs in culturing vessels or liquid nitrogen-frozen samples of adult
brains were lysed in M-PER or T-PER protein extraction reagents containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (all from Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA). Protein samples (30 μg) were separated by reducing sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF
membrane. The membranes were then immunoblotted with indicated
primary antibodies, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-
coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:20,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA; 711-035-152). Protein bands were visualized with
Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were phospho
ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA;
9101 and 9102), β-tubulin (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA; H-235) and neurofibromin (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-67).
Western signal band intensity was quantified using ImageJ Software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay assay
Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues of adult Nf1+/Arg681* mice using
TRIzol reagent (Thermo Scientific). Polyadenylated RNA was reversed
transcribed into cDNA in a 20 µl reaction containing 1 μg of total RNA
using SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Nf1
transcripts were amplified around the region of interest using 5 PRIME
MasterMix (5 PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD) with 2 µl of the transcribed
cDNA as the PCR template. A fragment of 417 bp was amplified with
primers forward: 5′-GTTCCTGCGTGCCTGTACTC and reverse: 5′-
TGTTCCCACTTTGCATGTGT. Three standard PCR steps were carried
out for 30 cycles with 94°C denaturing, 55°C annealing and 72°C extension.
The resulting PCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOP vector from the
TOP TA cloning kit (Thermo Scientific). Twenty-two individual clones
were sequenced using the T7 primer.

Electron microscopy
Mice of indicated genotypes were intracardially perfused with Karnovsky’s
fixation solution (3% paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/l
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 to 7.6). Sciatic nerves and spinal nerve roots were
dissected and post-fixed overnight. Tissues were then transferred to
0.175 mol/l cacodylate buffer, osmicated, dehydrated and embedded.
Semi-thin sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and
viewed on a FEI Tecnai T12 microscope.

Histological and immunological analyses
Mice were intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, w/v) in
PBS. Neurofibromas, sciatic nerves, spinal nerve roots and other tissues
were dissected and post-fixed overnight, followed by cryoprotection and
frozen sectioning. Serial sections of 12 μm thickness were prepared using a
cryostat (CM3050 S; Leica). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was
performed according to standard protocols.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistical comparisons were
analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post-test. A value
of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as
mean±s.e.m.
