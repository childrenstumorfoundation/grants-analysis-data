Conclusions and future directions for the
REiNS International Collaboration

ABSTRACT
The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International
Collaboration was established with the goal to develop consensus recommendations for the
use of endpoints in neurofibromatosis (NF) clinical trials. This supplement includes the first series
of REiNS recommendations for the use of patient-reported, functional, and visual outcomes, and
for the evaluation of imaging response in NF clinical trials. Recommendations for neurocognitive
outcome measures, the use of whole-body MRI in NF, the evaluation of potential biomarkers of
disease, and the comprehensive evaluation of functional and patient-reported outcomes in NF
are in development. The REiNS recommendations are made based on current knowledge. Expe-
rience with the use of the recommended endpoints in clinical trials, development of new tools
and technologies, new knowledge of the natural history of NF, and advances in the methods used
to analyze endpoints will likely lead to modifications of the currently proposed guidelines, which
will be shared with the NF research community through the REiNS Web site www.
reinscollaboration.org. Due to the clinical complexity of NF, there is a need to seek expertise
from multiple medical disciplines, regulatory agencies, and industry to develop trial endpoints
and designs, which will lead to the identification and approval of effective treatments for NF
tumor and nontumor manifestations. The REiNS Collaboration welcomes anyone interested in
providing his or her expertise toward this effort. Neurology® 2013;81 (Suppl 1):S41–S44

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis share the pre-
disposition to the development of multiple mostly benign nerve sheath tumors. However, there
are distinct differences in the clinical manifestations between NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis,
and there is substantial variability in the development of disease manifestations within each of
the forms of NF.1,2 As increasing numbers of clinical trials for NF-related tumor and nontumor
manifestations are ongoing, the need for the development of standardized trial endpoints specif-
ically for NF has emerged (see the introduction to this supplement, Plotkin et al.). The aim of the
Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis
International
Collaboration is to develop standardized endpoints for clinical trials for NF to allow for mean-
ingful comparisons of trial results and to accelerate the development of active and beneficial agents.
This supplement provides the first series of recommendations of the REiNS collaborative group
for endpoints in NF trials. The guidelines proposed in this supplement—for the evaluation of pain
(Wolters et al.), hearing and facial function (Plotkin et al.), vision (Fisher et al.), and imaging of
response (Dombi et al.)—can be readily incorporated as endpoints into clinical trials.

disabilities and cognitive impairments are common in
patients with NF1 and result in substantial disability.3
Clinical trials of statins for learning disability have
been published and others are under way.4 In addi-
tion, trials of nonpharmacologic treatments for learn-
ing disability (e.g., Cogmed) are in the planning
stages. The goal of the Neurocognitive group is to
standardize endpoints for these trials to promote
comparisons of efficacy between pharmacologic and
nonpharmacologic intervention trials.

Tumor involvement in NF can be extensive and in
some patients can affect virtually the entire body.
Whole-body MRI (WBMRI) is an emerging tech-
nique to evaluate the entire tumor burden in the body
in a short time (about 45 minutes), and it has been
evaluated in patients with NF.5–8 The Whole-body
MRI Working Group is tasked with evaluating the
reproducibility and potential utility of WBMRI in
clinical trials. Finally, the goals of the Biomarker
Working Group include the identification of bio-
markers of NF manifestations, including markers of
disease progression, or of transformation of histologi-
cally benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN) to malig-
nant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

The development of recommendations by REiNS
is an ongoing and dynamic process. Below we high-
light some challenges for ongoing and future work.

OPTIMAL USE OF FUNCTIONAL ENDPOINTS
Change of tumor size is an important endpoint in clin-
ical trials for benign NF tumors. Drugs that decrease
tumor size are considered to be active and worthy of fur-
ther study. However, to identify the benefits of new
treatments and to achieve drug approval, it will be nec-
essary to incorporate functional and patient-reported
outcomes (PRO) into clinical trials. The functional
measures proposed in this supplement for hearing in
NF2 vestibular schwannomas and for acuity in NF1-
related optic pathway gliomas provide examples of
how a meaningful functional outcome measure can
be used as the primary trial endpoint. In these trials,
change in tumor size should be included as a secondary
endpoint. For other NF-related tumors, such as PN or
extracranial schwannomas, a variety of morbidities may
result from tumor growth depending on the location,
size, and growth rate of the tumor. For example,
tumors compressing the spinal cord or involving the
brachial or lumbosacral plexus may result in weakness,
whereas tumors affecting the airway or bowel and blad-
der may result in organ compromise. The Functional
Endpoints Working Group is developing recommen-
dations for reproducible functional outcome measures
for each of the potential morbidities.

INCORPORATING PRO INTO TRIAL DESIGN Pain
is the most common symptom in schwannomatosis2
and is present in approximately 50% of patients

enrolled in clinical trials for NF1 and PN9,10 There-
fore, the initial focus of the PRO Working Group was
to provide recommendations for the evaluation of
pain intensity (Wolters et al., this supplement). Rec-
ommendations are in preparation for pain interfer-
ence, functional disability, and disease-specific and
general quality of life (QOL). This task is challenging
given the wide age range of affected individuals (from
infants to older adults) and the extensive morbidities
arising from tumor and nontumor manifestations
in NF. The systematic method developed by the
PRO group for reviewing, rating, and recommending
measures described in this supplement will streamline
this process and be applicable to the efforts of other
working groups. As an example, the Visual Outcomes
Working Group used this method to recommend a
visual QOL scale as a secondary endpoint measure for
optic pathway glioma trials. As much as possible, ex-
isting PRO measures will be recommended for use in
NF clinical trials, although they need to be validated
in the NF population. As reliable functional and PRO
measures for NF become available, the goal will be to
evaluate tumor size, function, and PROs simulta-
neously in trials, and to design trials with functional
and PROs as primary endpoints.

DEVELOPMENT OF
IMPROVED IMAGING
OUTCOMES In this supplement, the Tumor Measure-
ment Working Group proposes volumetric tumor meas-
urements as opposed to standard 1- or 2-dimensional
measurements for NF1-related PN and NF2-related ves-
tibular schwannomas (VS). Furthermore, the group de-
fines tumor progression and tumor response based on
much smaller changes than solid tumor response crite-
ria.8–10 These response criteria were chosen to maximize
the identification of active agents and to minimize the
duration of patients’ exposure to inactive agents. How-
ever, there is a need for additional studies to validate and
compare methods of volumetric analysis and to identify
the percent changes that can be reliably measured for
specific tumor types. Plans are under way to compare
currently used methods of volumetric analysis of PN and
VS to evaluate whether these can be used interchange-
ably in clinical trials. We will apply currently established
response criteria for pediatric and adult CNS tumors—
Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)11,12
and Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology
(RAPNO)13—to NF-related CNS tumors such as glio-
mas and meningiomas, if feasible.

In solid tumors, CT is frequently used to measure
change in tumor size. This method may have advan-
tages for NF patients with metal implants, which limit
the utility of MRI for volumetric analysis. Studies eval-
uating the utility of CT for response evaluation in NF
are thus another goal of the Tumor Measurement
Working Group.

The measurement of small decreases in tumor size
allows for identification of active agents. Ultimately,
studies that analyze the relationship between tumor
size and changes in functional and patient-reported
outcomes will be required to assess whether imaging
changes can serve as a surrogate for morbidity. For
example, while the degree of hearing loss in NF2 does
not correlate directly with the size of VS, there may be
a correlation between tumor size and morbidity for
other tumors. Finally, consideration should be given
to evaluating the utility of functional imaging, such
as PET or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in the
assessment of response to targeted therapies in future
research studies.

Our ultimate goal is to accelerate the identification
of active and clinically beneficial agents for NF. The
recent US Food and Drug Administration approval
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhib-
itor everolimus for patients with tuberous sclerosis
complex and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas
(SEGA)14 and the Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK1/2)
ruxolitinib for intermediate and high-risk myelofibro-
sis15 serve as potential examples for future NF trials.
These drugs were approved based on nonstandard out-
comes. Everolimus was approved based on a reduction
in tumor volume in patients enrolled in a single-arm
trial. Ruxolitinib was approved based on 2 placebo-
controlled trials using reduction in spleen volume as
a primary endpoint and reduction in patient-reported
symptoms as a key secondary endpoint.

Overall, the number of patients with NF available
for participation in clinical trials is small. It is thus
important that the most appropriate trial designs and
endpoints are utilized. Early interaction and collabora-
tion with regulatory agencies and industry will be crit-
ical to this process as trials with new endpoints and
designs are developed.
