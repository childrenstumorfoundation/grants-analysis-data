Neurofibromatosis	1	is	a	hereditary	syndrome	characterized	by	
the	development	of	numerous	benign	neurofibromas,	a	small	
subset	of	which	progress	to	malignant	peripheral	nerve	sheath	
tumors	(MPNSTs).	To	better	understand	the	genetic	basis	for	
MPNSTs,	we	performed	genome-wide	or	targeted	sequencing	on	
50	cases.	Sixteen	MPNSTs	but	none	of	the	neurofibromas	tested	
were	found	to	have	somatic	mutations	in	SUZ12,	implicating	it	
as	having	a	central	role	in	malignant	transformation.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen dis-
ease,  is  an  autosomal  dominant  hereditary  cancer  syndrome  that 
affects ~1 in 3,000 individuals1. It is characterized by features includ-
ing café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, axillary freckling, optic pathway 
gliomas, skeletal anomalies and neurofibromas. Neurofibromas are 
benign tumors that can be broadly classified on the basis of their 
location (as dermal, spinal or plexiform) or on the basis of their 
morphology (as localized, plexiform or diffuse)2. Some neurofibro-
mas, typically those that are deep-seated and plexiform, progress to 
MPNSTs3–5. An individual with NF1 has a 10–15% chance of develop-
ing an MPNST, and ~50% of all MPNSTs arise in the setting of NF1. 
MPNSTs are sarcomas that can arise anywhere in the body and confer 
a 5-year survival rate as low as 20%, despite treatment through radical 
surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy6.

Previous  studies  have  demonstrated  that  neurofibromas  in 
 individuals with NF1 develop through the acquisition of a somatic, 
inactivating mutation in the NF1 gene inherited from the unaffected 
parent7.  This  finding  is  in  accordance  with  the  two-hit  hypoth-
esis for tumor-suppressor genes8. However, the genetic alterations 
responsible for progression to much rarer MPNSTs are not known. 
To address this issue, we performed whole-genome sequencing on 
four MPNSTs, each from a different unrelated individual with NF1. 
We also performed whole-genome sequencing on leukocytes derived 

from the same individuals to determine whether the alterations iden-
tified were somatic. High-quality coverage averaged approximately  
59-fold  (range  of  55.1-  to  64.4-fold)  in  the  tumor  genomes  and 
approximately 42-fold (range of 40.2- to 46.3-fold) in the normal 
genomes (Supplementary Table 1). After processing the sequencing 
data using a series of bioinformatics algorithms and stringent base 
calling filters that have previously been described9, we identified a 
median of over 60 somatic nonsynonymous point mutations or small 
insertion-deletions (indels) (range of 14 to 208) in the coding regions 
of these tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). 
Of the 261 total alterations, 64.4%, 24.1%, 6.5% and 5% were missense, 
small indel, truncating or splice-site mutations, respectively. The most 
surprising and statistically significant of these somatic alterations 
were in the SUZ12 gene encoding zeste homolog 12 (Drosophila),  
a chromatin-modifying protein. Unequivocal inactivating mutations of 
SUZ12 occurred in each of the four MPNSTs studied (Supplementary 
Tables 2 and 3). All four mutations were confirmed through deep 
sequencing of PCR products from the altered regions, showing high 
fractions of mutant alleles in all cases (Table 1).

Subsequently, we were able to obtain and analyze four additional 
frozen tumors (from four different individuals) via either whole-
genome or whole-exome sequencing (Table 1 and Supplementary 
Tables  2  and  3).  One  of  these  additional  individuals  had  neuro-
fibromatosis, and her tumor contained an inactivating mutation of 
SUZ12. The other three MPNSTs were from individuals without a 
personal  or  family  history  of  neurofibromatosis.  The  sequencing 
coverage of the cancer and normal genomes was similar to that for 
the hereditary cases, as was the number of mutant genes (exclud-
ing MPNST 04, which had 208 alterations in the setting of previous 
radiation and chemotherapy) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). No 
SUZ12 mutations were observed in the sporadic MPNSTs. However, 
all three had inactivating mutations in other chromatin-modifying 
genes. One tumor had a mutation of the EED gene, whose gene prod-
uct is a member of Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), which 
includes the protein encoded by SUZ12. The two other nonheredi-
tary cases had mutations in EPC1 (encoding enhancer of Polycomb 
homolog 1 (Drosophila)) or CHD4 (encoding chromodomain helicase 
DNA-binding protein 4) (Table 1). The proteins encoded by SUZ12, 
EED, EPC1, AEBP2, EZH2 and RBBP7 all have pivotal roles in chro-
matin homeostasis and interact with PRCs. PRCs have critical roles 
in histone maintenance whereby they regulate methylation at lysine 9 
and lysine 27 of histone H3. Methylation at these positions results in 
transcriptional repression of target genes. There is a rapidly growing 
body of evidence showing that genes involved in chromatin homeo-
stasis, particularly those regulating methylation of histone H3, drive 
neoplastic development in a number of different tumor types10.

To validate these genetic data, we analyzed an independent collec-
tion of 42 paraffin-archived MPNST specimens. Thirty-one of these 
were from individuals with neurofibromatosis, and 11 were from spo-
radic cases. In 11 of the hereditary neurofibromatosis cases, a neurofi-
broma and an MPNST were available for comparison. Illumina-type 
libraries were constructed for all specimens, and library DNA was 
captured with probes corresponding to NF1, NF2 and six additional 
chromatin-modifying  genes,  including  SUZ12,  suspected  of  hav-
ing a role in MPNST on the basis of the results from the discovery 
screen. Fifteen MPNSTs harbored a somatic mutation in a chromatin-
 modifying gene, distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion (Fig. 1  
and  Supplementary  Tables  4  and  5).  The  gene  most  commonly 
affected by these mutations, by far, was SUZ12, altered in 11 tumors 
(26%). The fraction of MPNSTs harboring a SUZ12 mutation is likely 
an underestimate given the archival nature of these specimens and 
our inability to detect larger indels or translocations through the 
targeted sequencing approach with partially degraded DNA. Even 
so, of the 11 mutations detected, 9 were indels or truncating muta-
tions that would be expected to abolish protein function (Fig. 1a,b). 
Seven  of  the  SUZ12  mutations  were  from  MPNSTs  occurring  in 
individuals with NF1, and the remaining four were from sporadic 
cases. None of the 11 neurofibromas tested had mutations in SUZ12 
(Supplementary Table 4). To determine the functional consequence 
of the SUZ12 mutations, we performed immunohistochemistry for 
SUZ12 expression on 25 MPNST samples (in the other cases, insuf-
ficient amounts of high-quality tissue were available). In the 5 cases 
tested with SUZ12 alterations, no protein expression was detected. 
In addition, 1 tumor in which a mutation was not found also lacked 
SUZ12 expression, whereas the other 19 cases without evident SUZ12

Adjacent normal cells provided unequivocal internal controls for 
staining in all cases (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Most individuals with NF1 carry a causative germline point muta-
tion or small indel within the NF1 gene. However, 5–10% of indi-
viduals with NF1 have a larger deletion on chromosome 17q11.2 that 
involves the entire NF1 locus as well as a variable number of adjacent 
genes. There are two classes of deletion, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1  
and type 2 deletions are thought to arise via nonallelic homologous 
recombination involving the NF1–REP A and NF1–REP C and the 
SUZ12 and SUZ12P regions, respectively11,12. Both deletion types 
incorporate the SUZ12 gene. The germline deletions of SUZ12 and 
other genes in these regions were assumed to be passenger events in 
tumorigenesis, occurring only coincidentally owing to the adjacency 
of these regions to the target NF1 locus. Our discovery of the consist-
ent presence of inactivating somatic mutations in SUZ12 in hereditary 
MPNSTs leaves little doubt that these mutations have a major role in 
the pathogenesis of this tumor type.

Recurrent, inactivating SUZ12 mutations have not previously been 
reported in any tumor type, although a small fraction of hematological 
malignancies have been shown to harbor missense mutations7,13–15. 
However, SUZ12 has been definitively implicated in the pathogenesis 
of endometrial stromal sarcoma, where more than 50% of tumors 
have a t(7;17)(p15;q21) translocation resulting in the JAZF1-SUZ12 
gene fusion16. The fusion gene is thought to promote cell prolifera-
tion and protects against hypoxia-induced apoptosis17. Interestingly, 
this fusion likely activates the SUZ12 gene, endowing it with onco-
genic functions17. Expression-based analyses have also suggested that 
SUZ12 might have a role in non–small-cell lung, colon and gastric 
cancers7,8,18. In contrast, the mutations we identified in MPNSTs 
inactivate SUZ12, indicating that this gene is a tumor suppressor. 
This situation is reminiscent of the dual roles of NOTCH1, in which 
activating mutations occur in lymphomas and inactivating mutations 
are characteristic of squamous cell cancers19.

We posit that hereditary MPNSTs develop from benign neurofi-
bromas by virtue of germline NF1 mutation (first hit) combined with 
somatic inactivation of the NF1 allele from the non-affected parent 
(second hit). In those neurofibromas in which the first or second hit 
is a deletion that coincidentally affects SUZ12, the stage is set for a 
subsequent mutation of the remaining SUZ12 allele (third hit). This 
third hit would convert the neurofibroma to an MPNST and would 
emerge when the first hit is a type 1 or type 2 microdeletion or when 
the second hit involves loss of a large region on chromosome 17q 
including both NF1 and SUZ12. This model is supported by the fact 
that three of the five NF1-associated MPNSTs that underwent either 
whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing had a somatic deletion 
on chromosome 17q that involved both NF1 and SUZ12 (Table 1). 
With only one allele of SUZ12 remaining, the probability of a single 
additional hit in SUZ12 is much greater than the probability of two 
independent mutations (two additional hits) occurring in another 
chromatin-modifying gene. Although our explanation is speculative, 
it is consistent with the absence of SUZ12 mutations in neurofibromas 
(Supplementary Table 4) and the fact that individuals with germline 
microdeletions of the NF1 locus are at greater risk for the development 
of MPNSTs than individuals with NF1 who have point mutations of 

NF1 (ref. 2). Future studies on larger cohorts of individuals with NF1, 
as well as functional studies, will be necessary to fully elucidate the 
precise role of SUZ12 in MPNST.

Sample acquisition. Fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor and matched 
blood were obtained from patients under an institutional review board (IRB)-
approved protocol at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. When matched blood was 
collected, informed consent from each patient was obtained. The diagnosis 
of each specimen underwent central pathological review and was verified by 
an independent group of pathologists. Tumor tissue was analyzed to assess 
neoplastic cellularity. Tumors were macrodissected to remove residual normal 
tissue and enhance neoplastic cellularity.

Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Genomic DNA libraries were 
prepared and captured according to the protocol suggested by Illumina and 
as previously described9,20. DNA libraries were sequenced with the Illumina 
HiSeq Genome Analyzer, yielding 100 bp of sequence from the final library 
fragments for whole-exome and whole-genome analyses.

Targeted capture. A DNA-targeted capture chip was designed to capture all 
the exons of eight genes: NF1 (CCDS11264.1, CCDS42292.1, CCDS45645.1), 
NF2 (CCDS13865.1, CCDS54516.1), EED (CCDS8273.1, CCDS8274.1), SUZ12 
(CCDS11270.1), EZH2 (CCDS5892.1, CCDS56518.1), RBBP4 (CCDS366.1, 
CCDS44106.1),  RBBP7  (CCDS14179.1,  CCDS56598.1)  and  AEBP2 
(CCDS44842.1, CCDS58215.1). The total coverage of the chip was 70,583 bp. 
Capture was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment kit 
(Agilent Technologies).

Bioinformatics analysis. Bioinformatics analyses were performed at Personal 
Genome  Diagnostics.  Whole-genome  and  whole-exome  sequencing  data 
for matched tumor and normal samples were analyzed to identify tumor-
 specific mutations. Tumor and normal sequences were aligned to the human 
 reference genome (hg19) using Illumina CASAVA and ELAND. Alignments 

were analyzed to identify somatic point mutations and small insertions and 
deletions present in tumor but not in matched normal samples. The functional 
consequence of each mutation was predicted using gene annotations from the 
CCDS, RefSeq and Ensembl databases. Mutations were filtered for sequenc-
ing quality, depth of coverage in the tumor and normal samples, and mutant 
fraction. Known polymorphisms recorded in dbSNP were removed from the 
analysis. Mutant reads that matched the reference genome in multiple locations 
were excluded as possible alignment artifacts. Potential somatic mutations 
were visually inspected as described previously20. Copy number alterations 
were identified by comparing the normalized average per-base coverage for a 
particular gene in a tumor sample to the normalized average per-base coverage 
in a matched normal sample for the patient.

Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40 tumor 
cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-µm formalin-fixed, paraffin- 
embedded  sections  using  an  automated  slide  stainer  (Benchmark  Ultra, 
Ventana Medical System). Positive and negative controls (HeLa cells and ton-
sil tissue) were tested in parallel. For staining, sections were deparaffinized 
and hydrated, and an antigen retrieval step was performed using a high-pH 
buffer. Antibodies to histone H3 (trimethylated at lysine 27) (mabcam 6147, 
Abcam) and SUZ12 (SUZ220A) (ab126577, Abcam) were applied using opti-
mal dilutions (10  µg/ml), and reactions were developed using Opti-View 
DAB detection (Ventana Medical System). Nuclear labeling was scored for all 
MPNST and neurofibroma cases. Tumors were scored as positive when nuclear 
staining was intact and were scored as lost when tumor cells were negative 
for immunostaining. Staining of lymphocytes and endothelium was used as  
internal controls.
