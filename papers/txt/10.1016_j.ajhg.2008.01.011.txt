Apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with major congenital anomalies represent natural experiments of
gene disruption and dysregulation. These individuals can be studied to identify novel genes critical in human development and to an-
notate further the function of known genes. Identiﬁcation and characterization of these genes is the goal of the Developmental Genome
Anatomy Project (DGAP). DGAP is a multidisciplinary effort that leverages the recent advances resulting from the Human Genome Pro-
ject to increase our understanding of birth defects and the process of human development. Clinically signiﬁcant phenotypes of individ-
uals enrolled in DGAP are varied and, in most cases, involve multiple organ systems. Study of these individuals’ chromosomal rearrange-
ments has resulted in the mapping of 77 breakpoints from 40 chromosomal rearrangements by FISH with BACs and fosmids, array CGH,
Southern-blot hybridization, MLPA, RT-PCR, and suppression PCR. Eighteen chromosomal breakpoints have been cloned and se-
quenced. Unsuspected genomic imbalances and cryptic rearrangements were detected, but less frequently than has been reported pre-
viously. Chromosomal rearrangements, both balanced and unbalanced, in individuals with multiple congenital anomalies continue to
be a valuable resource for gene discovery and annotation.

Introduction

Approximately 1 in 2000 newborns has a de novo balanced
chromosomal rearrangement.1 Although the majority of
these individuals will have no discernible clinical pheno-
type, the risk for a congenital anomaly in this population
is two to three times higher than that observed in an unse-
lected population of newborns, for which the risk of anom-
alies is 2%–3%.1 Clinical ﬁndings observed in patients with
such chromosomal rearrangements are thought to be
caused by disruption or dysregulation of a gene (or genes)
at or near the breakpoint. The underlying pathogenetic
mechanism may result from an intragenic break,2,3 from ac-
companying genomic copy alterations at or in the vicinity
of the breakpoint,4 from production of a chimeric gene,5
or from a position effect on a gene (or genes) distant from
the breakpoint.6 In addition, chromosomal rearrangements
may disrupt noncoding RNA genes or conserved nongenic

sequences, two elements whose roles in genome architec-
ture and gene regulation have yet to be elucidated fully.7,8
The resulting physiological consequences can include com-
plete abrogation of the protein if the corresponding allele is
imprinted or otherwise mutated, haploinsufﬁciency, ele-
vated expression, or creation of a fusion protein with a dom-
inant-negative effect or novel gain of function.

Use of chromosomal rearrangements as signposts for
genes important in human disease is well documented.9–15

abnormalities and chromosomal rearrangements used the
above methods and have revealed that some presumably
balanced rearrangements include cryptic deletions or more
complex rearrangements.16,17 However, these investiga-
tions have examined relatively small numbers of patients
and have not speciﬁcally studied the breakpoints at the level
of the DNA sequence.

In this study, we describe the comprehensive examina-
tion of 40 reportedly balanced chromosomal rearrange-
ments from patients with clinical abnormalities. These
patients were ascertained through the Developmental Ge-
nome Anatomy Project (DGAP). DGAP is a multidisciplinary
study bringing together cytogeneticists, molecular biolo-
gists, and developmental biologists to understand the ge-
netic basis of birth defects and the underlying molecular ba-
sis of development. This goal is pursued through the study of
individuals with apparently balanced chromosomal rear-
rangements who also have major congenital anomalies.
Through leveraging of the resources generated by the Hu-
man Genome Project, the breakpoints of these rearrange-
ments can be mapped expeditiously to discover and anno-
tate genes likely to be critical in mammalian development.
As a consequence of this effort, we characterized 77 break-
points from 40 chromosomal rearrangements by using FISH
with BACs and fosmids, array CGH, Southern-blot hybrid-
ization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
(MLPA), RT-PCR, and suppression PCR. Eighteen chromo-
somal breakpoints were cloned and sequenced. Herein we
report the detailed analyses of these rearrangements includ-
ing identiﬁcation of cryptic copy-number alterations and
complex rearrangements.

Material and Methods

Patients and Cell Lines
Individuals were enrolled in the DGAP study after identiﬁcation of
an apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangement and at least
one clinically signiﬁcant congenital anomaly (e.g., cleft lip). All hu-
man study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Partners
Health Care System Human Research Committee. Lymphocyte cell
transformation was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospi-
tal Genomics Core Facility in the Center for Human Genetic Re-
search (Boston, MA). Cell lines prepared from individuals with sim-
ilar phenotypic and cytogenetic criteria were obtained from the
National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Human
Genetic Cell Repository (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ).

Cytogenetic Analysis
Metaphase chromosomes were prepared from lymphoblastoid cell
lines or ﬁbroblast cultures according to routine protocols. Chro-
mosomes were GTG banded via standard methods, and at least
ten metaphase spreads were examined per patient. Resolution
for the GTG-banded chromosomes was R 550 bands.

Database. BACs from the RP1, RP3, RP4, RP5, RP6, RP11, and
RP13 libraries and fosmids from the wi2 library were obtained
from Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI, Oak-
land, CA). BACs from the CTB, CTC, and CTD libraries were ob-
tained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). DNA was isolated in
accordance with a standard protocol consisting of alkaline lysis, neu-
tralization, and ethanol precipitation (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) fragments were generated by routine
methods. PCR fragments were either gel puriﬁed with the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) or puriﬁed with the QIAquick PCR Pu-
riﬁcation Kit (QIAGEN). Isolated DNA was labeled directly with ei-
ther SpectrumGreen- or SpectrumOrange-conjugated dUTP, via
the Nick Translation Reagent Kit from Abbott Molecular/Vysis
(Des Plaines, IL), or indirectly with biotin or digoxygenin via the
DIG DNA Labeling Kit or Biotin DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnos-
tics, Indianapolis, IN). Cot-I DNA was added to suppress repetitive
sequences, and probes were ethanol precipitated and resuspended
in Hybrisol containing 50% formamide (Abbott Molecular/Vysis).

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Metaphase chromosome preparations from each DGAP case were
prepared on glass slides in accordance with standard hypotonic ly-
sis and ﬁxation, followed by dehydration in a series of ethanol
washes and probe application. Both probes and chromosomes
were denatured simultaneously at 72C for 2 min and incubated
overnight at 37C in a HYBrite apparatus (Abbott Molecular/
Vysis). Slides were washed in 50% formamide/23SSC at 37C for
20 min and 23SSC at 37C for 20 min. 40,60-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole hydrochloride (DAPI) was used as counterstain. Hybridiza-
tion results were assessed with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 epiﬂuorescence
microscope (Thornwood, NY) or an Olympus BX51 microscope
(Center Valley, PA), and images were acquired with an Applied
Imaging CytoVision cytogenetics workstation (Santa Clara, CA).
A minimum of ten metaphases were scored per probe (set).

Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization
aCGH was performed with either Spectral Genomics 2600 BAC ar-
rays (Houston, TX) with an ~1 Mb resolution or Agilent Technol-
ogies 244K (G4411B) oligonucleotide arrays consisting of 60-mer
oligonucleotides spaced at 8.9 kb (Santa Clara, CA).

Southern-Blot Analysis
Southern blotting was performed by standard methods. BAC se-
quences of breakpoint critical regions were examined with Repeat
Masker to identify regions from which unique probes could be
generated. Genomic DNA probes of ~200 to ~1500 base pairs
(bp) were prepared from these nonrepetitive sequences by PCR.
PCR products were labeled with the Megaprime DNA labeling
Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Aberrant bands de-
tected in patient samples but absent in control samples indicated
localization of the breakpoint within these restriction fragments.

Breakpoint Cloning
Rearrangement breakpoints were cloned via modiﬁcations of the
suppression PCR protocol18 as described.19 Cloned junction frag-
ments were sequenced by standard methods.

Probes for Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
BACs for breakpoint mapping of chromosomal rearrangements were
selected with the University of California Santa Cruz Genome
Browser and Database and the NCBI Human Genome Browser and

Fusion Transcript Ampliﬁcation
Fusion transcript ampliﬁcation was performed with RT-PCR
according to routine protocols. Primer sequences are previously
described.2,20

Candidate-Gene Transcript Analysis
Gene dosage of selected candidate genes was investigated with
MLPA as described.21

Analysis of Sequence Motifs at Breakpoint Regions
Eighteen sequenced breakpoints (from DGAP cases 003, 011, 012,
032, 090, 097, 105, 107, and 151) were used for this analysis. A
nonredundant set of sequences, consisting of 15 bp upstream
and downstream of each breakpoint (i.e., 30 to 60 bp per break-
point, depending on the presence and length of deletions at the
breakpoint itself), were extracted and used for analysis. This
yielded 841 bp of breakpoint-associated sequence. A Poisson distri-
bution was used to evaluate whether an excess of observations of
each motif was present in the breakpoint-associated sequence. For
each evaluated motif, background frequencies were estimated by
their frequency of occurrence in an arbitrary 1 Mb of human geno-
mic sequence (from chromosome 10).

Results

Samples were obtained from individuals with a wide spec-
trum of anomalies, and no speciﬁc anomaly or organ sys-
tem was the focus of enrollment in the DGAP study. Phe-
notypes of DGAP cases include physical ﬁndings such as
cleft lip and palate, neurological impairments such as ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder, and multisystem abnormali-
ties (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Breakpoint Mapping
Cell lines established from individuals enrolled in DGAP
were examined initially with FISH with BAC probes to de-
ﬁne the genomic region of the breakpoints. A series of iter-
ative experiments with clones in the region was performed
until one clone produced a ‘‘split signal.’’ A genomic clone
was determined to contain the breakpoint if signals were
observed on the normal chromosome and both derivative
chromosomes. Through the use of overlapping end-se-
quenced BAC clones and smaller probes, such as fosmids
and PCR fragments, breakpoint critical regions were nar-
rowed further to as small a region as 0.4 kilobases (kb).

As a result of the FISH analyses, the initial reported kar-
yotype designations determined by GTG banding were re-
vised for 18 of the 40 chromosomal rearrangements. For all
but one rearrangement, the reﬁned breakpoint shifted to
the adjacent GTG band or next most adjacent GTG band.
This ﬁnding is not surprising given the lower resolution
of GTG banding compared with FISH and the relatively
subjective nature of breakpoint designation via GTG band-
ing. For the single case in which the breakpoints mapped
were substantially different from those reported, the GTG-
banded karyotype was reviewed and the FISH-based break-
point assignments conﬁrmed.

FISH analyses also revealed that a number of DGAP cases
have deletions (Table 2). Deletions ranging in size from
~500 kb to 12 megabases (Mb) were found in 15 of 40
DGAP cases analyzed. The majority of these deletions map-
ped to the breakpoints, although ﬁve (DGAP089, 159, 169,

174, and 200) mapped at a distance from the breakpoint
and one (DGAP107) was completely independent of the
breakpoint. Three cases (DGAP106, 159, 169) had dele-
tions at both breakpoints. The 12 Mb deletion seen in
DGAP089 was reported to us during the course of our study
by the submitting geneticist after detection by conven-
tional (metaphase) CGH.22 This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed
and the boundaries of the deletion were reﬁned by Spectral
Genomics 2600 BAC aCGH.23 In the case of the DGAP107
deletion, the referring physician reported a serendipitous
discovery of a deletion in the Smith-Magenis syndrome
critical region during a laboratory study of patients
with sleep disturbances; DGAP107 had been selected as
a control specimen for probe validation. Once this deletion
was reported to us, the deletion interval was veriﬁed by
FISH.20

We identiﬁed only two complex rearrangements among
this reported series of DGAP cases. DGAP018 had a reported
karyotype of 46,XX,ins(3;1)(q23;p22p32). FISH analysis
with ﬁve BACs that mapped to 1p32 through 1p21 hybrid-
ized to what appeared to be a derivative chromosome 2,
der(2). Multiplex FISH (M-FISH) was performed and re-
vealed that material from chromosome 1 was inserted
into the short arm of chromosome 2, and material from
chromosome 2 was inserted into the long arm of chromo-
some 3. FISH experiments using BACs localized to the in-
terval of chromosome 2p14 to 2p16-p21 suggested that
this interval is duplicated and inserted into chromosome
3. In the second case, DGAP122, a complex rearrangement
was reported between chromosomes 1, 5, and 9, and the
karyotype was revised to the following: 46,XY,t(1;9;5)(1p-
ter/1q32::9p22-24::5q15/5qter;9pter/9p24::9p22/
9qter;5pter/5q15::1q32/1qter). FISH analysis of this
case revealed even further rearrangements with multiple
possible duplications.

In addition to FISH analyses, selected cases were ana-
lyzed with aCGH (Table 3). Eleven cases were examined
with either Spectral Genomics 2600 BAC arrays or Agilent
Technologies 244K oligonucleotide arrays, and one case
was examined with both. Five cases showed no additional
rearrangements. Six cases showed copy-number losses
ranging in size from 0.5 Mb to ~12 Mb. The 12 Mb loss
seen in DGAP089 was observed cytogenetically, and the
array experiment reﬁned the boundaries of the deletion.
No cases had copy-number gains by array analysis.

After breakpoint regions were narrowed to a minimum
region of ~20 kb with FISH probes, Southern-blot analysis
was performed for 15 breakpoints. These breakpoints were
pursued beyond the limits of FISH analysis because they
harbored the most promising candidate genes in the vicin-
ity of the FISH-mapped breakpoint. Breakpoint localiza-
tion by Southern blotting revealed slight discrepancies be-
tween the localization predicted by FISH mapping and the
Southern-blot analysis in six cases. These six breakpoints
were localized outside the FISH-deﬁned region by an inter-
val ranging from 6 to 32 kb. In one case, DGAP100, the
cloned breakpoint was 8 kb from the terminus within

a BAC clone that did not show a split hybridization signal
on metaphase chromosomes. This example demonstrates
the intrinsic difﬁculty in detecting hybridization to both
derivative chromosomes when the breakpoint is located
at the corresponding end of the FISH probe. Unequal distri-
bution of repetitive and single-copy sequences in the BAC
probe could create the same difﬁculty. Use of smaller
probes such as fosmids and PCR products may help to min-
imize such discrepancies. Our strategy to clone the break-

points incorporates this information by screening for
a breakpoint in the 10 to 30 kb genomic segment ﬂanking
the FISH-deﬁned region.

After breakpoint regions were localized to single restric-
tion fragments, suppression PCR was used to amplify junc-
tion sequences.18 These PCR products were then cloned
and sequenced. With this approach, eighteen breakpoints
have been cloned and sequenced from nine chromosomal
rearrangements (Table 4).

Breakpoint Sequence Analysis
We examined the genomic architecture of the breakpoint
regions. Analysis of the 18 cloned breakpoints revealed
11 microdeletions of 1–16 bp, six insertions of 2–17 bp,
two duplications of 3 and 13 bp, and four rearrangements
without gain or loss of a nucleotide at one or more break-
points. Three of the 18 breakpoints showed multiple types
of sequence changes including deletion and insertion or
duplication (Table 4). In one case (DGAP011), both break-
points were perfectly balanced (i.e., no loss or gain of se-
quence on either derivative chromosome). In eight cases,
breakpoints fell within repetitive sequences including
three LINE, three Alu/SINE, and two LTR elements. Inter-

estingly, both breakpoints in DGAP095 contain AluSx
elements, possibly facilitating formation of this rearrange-
ment via illegitimate recombination.

To explore a possible common mechanism of formation
of the chromosomal rearrangements studied, we searched
for possible common sequence motifs at the breakpoints.
We ﬁrst evaluated 37 motifs listed by Abeysinghe et al.
in their analyses of 235 sequences.24 These motifs either
had previously been noted to be present at rearrangement
breakpoints or are associated with mechanisms (e.g., re-
combination) that might be etiologic in a rearrangement.
Several of the sequence motifs were reported in that study
to be overrepresented at translocation breakpoints. In con-
trast, we found that none of these 37 sequence motifs was
signiﬁcantly overrepresented in our set of breakpoint se-
quences after correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing.
It is possible that the number of breakpoints assessed in
our study was insufﬁcient to replicate the ﬁndings of the
previous study. However, breakpoint sequences analyzed
by Abeysinghe et al. were primarily derived from malig-
nancies, rather than de novo germline rearrangements,
and a different molecular mechanism may reasonably
underlie their origin.24

As a more comprehensive search, we tested partially de-
generate 8-mer motifs by the same method, in which each
motif consisted of six ﬁxed positions and two degenerate
positions (e.g., AGAGNAGN). After testing of the full set
of possibilities for sequence motifs with this structure,
none was found to be overrepresented in the breakpoint
sequences after correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing.
Submission of the breakpoint sequences to the YMF 3.0
motif-ﬁnding tool yielded ATWAGGRA as the top-scoring
motif, with ﬁve occurrences, but the signiﬁcance of this

motif is uncertain because it is unclear how many hypoth-
eses are tested by this algorithm. Further testing of this mo-
tif as a speciﬁc hypothesis can be performed as additional
examples of breakpoint sequences are determined.

Forty-seven breakpoints from 27 cases were positioned
and examined for candidate genes. Genes were directly dis-
rupted by 34 breakpoints (Table 4): 22 within introns
(ranging in size from 2.9 to 379 kb with an average size of
63 kb), one in a 30 UTR, and 11 not yet precisely localized.
Only 13 breakpoints fell in nongenic regions. These data
support the hypothesis that the chromosomal rearrange-
ments in these phenotypically abnormal patients fre-
quently disrupt or dysregulate a gene (or genes). Three
cases revealed gene fusions that produce fusion transcripts
identiﬁed by RT-PCR (DGAP011, 012, and 107). Although
fusion transcripts frequently result from translocations in
neoplasms, they have rarely been described in constitu-
tional rearrangements.5 The clinical signiﬁcance of the
fusion transcripts produced in DGAP011 and DGAP012
remain to be determined. The DGAP107 fusion transcript
results in a dominant-negative ROBO2 protein that abro-
gates downstream signaling.20

Discussion

In this study, we describe the most detailed analysis to date
of apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in
individuals with an abnormal phenotype. We have lever-
aged recent advances in the Human Genome Project and
subsequent resources that have become available to lo-
calize functionally important genes on human chromo-
somes. In the process of uncovering these genes, we have
analyzed 77 breakpoints from 40 chromosomal rearrange-
ments, including sequence analysis of 18 of these break-
points.

Recent reports have suggested that apparently balanced
constitutional translocations in patients presenting with ab-
normal phenotypes may be more complex when analyzed
at a higher level of resolution.16,17 Our analyses revealed
cryptic rearrangements in 15 of 40 (~37%) cases. The major-

ity of deletions occurred at breakpoints; however, in ﬁve
cases, additional rearrangements were identiﬁed at a dis-
tance (0.2 Mb to 10 Mb) from the respective breakpoints.
In DGAP107, the additional deletion was on a chromosome
not involved in the reported translocation. It is reasonable
to hypothesize that deletions at breakpoints may have oc-
curred in the course of the formation of the chromosomal
rearrangements. Deletions at a distance from breakpoints
may be unrelated to the rearrangement, or may reﬂect
a more complex mechanism that promotes both interchro-
mosomal exchange and intrachromosomal deletion.

Gribble et al. reported detecting rearrangements of previ-
ously unsuspected complexity in six out of ten patients
after detailed analysis of apparently balanced transloca-
tions.17 We observed approximately two-thirds the rate
of additional complexity as compared to this study, poten-
tially reﬂecting the different patient populations analyzed.
The abnormal phenotypes for the patients analyzed by
Gribble et al. were largely described as learning disabilities
and developmental delay.17 Although we analyzed pa-
tients with these abnormalities as part of a more complex
phenotype, we also analyzed patients with a greater variety
of phenotypes (Figure 1 and Table 1). It also should be
noted that Gribble et al. used aCGH at ~1 Mb resolution
and array painting to characterize the rearrangements
in their study.17 Although we did analyze a subset of our
rearrangements (11 cases) with aCGH, not all cases were
subjected to a genome-wide assessment. However, our
analyses allowed us to detect complexities at or near the
breakpoints and would only have failed to uncover a rear-
rangement at a great distance from or in a region unrelated
to the reported rearrangements. aCGH is clearly a valuable
technology to complement FISH characterization of appar-
ently balanced chromosomal rearrangements.

The mechanism of formation of these nonrecurrent
chromosomal rearrangements is still unknown. Recip-
rocal translocations may be the result of two random
double-strand breaks followed by ligation repair of these
breaks by homologous recombination or nonhomologous
end joining (NHEJ). For those rearrangements without

sequence similarity at the breakpoints, NHEJ may be in-
volved in translocation formation because additional geno-
mic alterations such as small deletions, insertions, or dupli-
cations at the breakpoint junctions have been detected.25–27
Few constitutional rearrangements have been examined
at the sequence level to elucidate possible mechanisms of
formation.24,28 Examination of 18 breakpoints sequenced
in this study revealed one case with no loss or gain of ma-
terial at the breakpoint junction and the majority with
small duplications, insertions, and deletions. These data
would suggest a mechanism of NHEJ in the formation of
these rearrangements. Only one case, DGAP095, exhibited
at both breakpoints a degree of sequence similarity (AluSx
sequence) that may have mediated formation of the trans-
location. Although analyses of the breakpoints did not un-
cover a speciﬁc sequence or motif that would support a hy-

pothesis for a mechanism of formation, these data may be
a valuable ﬁrst step to future studies to elucidate a mecha-
nism (or mechanisms) of chromosomal rearrangement.

Cases that revealed greater karyotypic complexity (Table
2) may be the result of a different mechanistic origin. The
large deletions found at and away from the breakpoints
could result from chromosomal pulverization at the site
of rearrangement rather than the more precise double-
strand breaks described above. Repair of these fragmented
chromosomes could result in the large deletions observed.
Recent analyses of cancer cell lines and a bone-marrow
specimen from a patient with myeloproliferative disorder
demonstrate deletions both at the breakpoints and at
a site distant from the breakpoints.29–31

DGAP affords a unique opportunity to discover genes in-
volved in developmental processes that otherwise could be

720 The American Journal of Human Genetics 82, 712–722, March 2008

difﬁcult or essentially impossible to identify;2,19,20,32–35
mutations in some of these genes may not be found segre-
gating as Mendelian traits in human families because
affected individuals may have a genetic ﬁtness of zero. In
keeping with the overarching goal of gene discovery in
the DGAP study, genes were found to be disrupted at 34
breakpoints. Seven candidate genes have functions that
remain to be investigated.

In addition to identifying new genes, this gene-discov-
ery approach may uncover known genes with previously
unappreciated roles in developmental pathways. Examples
include SUMO1 (MIM 601912) in palatal development,19
ROBO2 (MIM 602431) in urinary tract development,20
and NFIA (MIM 600727) in urinary tract and central ner-
vous system development.23 Thus far, we have shown dis-
rupted genes to be contributory to the patient’s phenotype
in 12 cases (Table 1).

Our data support the hypothesis that apparently bal-
anced chromosomal rearrangements are valuable biologi-
cal landmarks for genes important in human develop-
ment. Although cryptic genomic disturbances may also be
observed in individuals with congenital anomalies and ap-
parently balanced rearrangements by conventional cy-
togenetics, their presence does not necessarily diminish
the value of a particular case in contributing to the un-
derstanding of the genetic basis of a developmental
disorder.20,23 In sum, naturally occurring chromosomal
rearrangements continue to be a rich resource for gene
discovery and annotation.
