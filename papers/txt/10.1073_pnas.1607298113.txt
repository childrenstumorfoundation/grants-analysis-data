Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome are related
diseases with partially overlapping symptoms caused by alterations
of the tumor suppressor genes NF1 (encoding the protein neurofibro-
min) and SPRED1 (encoding sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing
protein 1, Spred1), respectively. Both proteins are negative regulators
of Ras/MAPK signaling with neurofibromin functioning as a Ras-
specific GTPase activating protein (GAP) and Spred1 acting on hitherto
undefined components of the pathway. Importantly, neurofibromin
has been identified as a key protein in the development of cancer, as
it is genetically altered in a large number of sporadic human malig-
nancies unrelated to NF1. Spred1 has previously been demonstrated
to interact with neurofibromin via its N-terminal Ena/VASP Homol-
ogy 1 (EVH1) domain and to mediate membrane translocation of its
target dependent on its C-terminal Sprouty domain. However, the
region of neurofibromin required for the interaction with Spred1 has
remained unclear. Here we show that the EVH1 domain of Spred1
binds to the noncatalytic (GAPex) portion of the GAP-related domain
(GRD) of neurofibromin. Binding is compatible with simultaneous
binding of Ras and does not interfere with GAP activity. Our study
points to a potential targeting function of the GAPex subdomain of
neurofibromin that is present in all known canonical RasGAPs.

glycerophospholipid binding Sec14-like domain associated with a
previously undetected C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH)-like
domain (13–15). Although a number of interaction partners of
neurofibromin have been reported, the significance of the un-
derlying protein–protein interaction is not clearly established in
many cases, as reviewed in refs. 2 and 16.

The recently described Legius syndrome (LS) shares the
milder features with NF1, including café au lait macules, axillary
freckling, and sometimes macrocephaly, but does not appear to
include the more severe clinical manifestations of NF1 such as
neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas, or osseous lesions (17).
LS is caused by germ-line mutations in the SPRED1 gene
(17, 18) encoding the Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing
protein 1 (Spred1), which has been demonstrated to specifically
inhibit the Ras/MAPK pathway in response to growth factor-,
cytokine-, and chemokine-induced ERK activation (19–22). In
pediatric acute myeloblastic leukemia, Spred1 acts as a tumor
suppressor (23). The 50-kDa protein comprises an N-terminal
Ena/VASP Homology 1 (EVH1) domain (24) and a C-terminal
Sprouty-related domain (SPR) separated by a central c-Kit bind-
ing domain (19). EVH1 domains are PH-like protein–protein
interaction modules (25, 26) that bind to proline rich sequence
stretches of the type FPPPP (27, 28). Most of the reported in-
teraction partners of Spred1 involve binding the C-terminal SPR
domain with unclear function or significance (29). Most of the

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant

genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3,500 newborns
and full penetrance. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of
developing the disease-typical neurofibromas consisting of benign
and malignant tumors of the nervous system. Additional symptoms
include characteristic pigmentation anomalies (café au lait mac-
ules, axillary freckling), melanocytic hamartomas of the iris (Lisch
nodules), bone deformations, and learning disabilities, altogether
defining a clinical picture that is far from being well understood
and for which no cure is available (1). The tumor suppressor gene
NF1 encodes the giant signal regulatory protein neurofibromin and
is mutated in NF1 patients. The reported alterations (currently
>2,000 mutations are listed in the Human Gene Mutation Data-
base) include splice variants, nonsense and missense mutations,
insertions and deletions, duplications and rearrangements, as well
as repeat variations (www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php). About
10% of the mutations comprise nontruncating (in-frame) de-
letions or missense mutations that are in principle compatible
with the translation of the protein product (2).

Neurofibromin is a 320-kDa Ras-specific GTPase activating
protein (RasGAP) that uses the central GAP-related domain
(GRD) to enhance the GTPase activity of the small guanine nu-
cleotide binding protein Ras, thereby down-regulating its biological
activity (3–5). The NF1 gene has gained considerable impact as it is
frequently mutated in a variety of very aggressive human malig-
nancies, including glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma, acute my-
eloid leukemia, and ovarian and breast cancers (6–12). Using
structural biology approaches, we previously discovered a bipartite
module located C-terminal to the GRD that is composed of a

Significance

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) are
disorders characterized by deregulation of the Ras/MAPK path-
way, which is central to a variety of cellular processes, including
growth and differentiation. Both neurofibromin protein and
Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1) in-
hibit the Ras/MAPK pathway, and loss-of-function alterations in
their encoding genes cause NF1 or LS, respectively. Such alter-
ations are also often found in sporadic tumors unrelated to NF1 or
LS. An earlier report described a cellular complex containing
neurofibromin and Spred1; the details of these interactions
remained unknown. Here we show that the EVH1 domain of
Spred1 binds to the GTPase activating protein-related domain of
neurofibromin without interfering with its catalytic activity. We
further describe how a disease associated mutation in neuro-
fibromin prevents Spred1 binding.

LS-associated mutations found in the SPRED1 gene result in pre-
mature stop codons, presumably associated with truncated trans-
lation products, and the majority of the identified nontruncating
missense mutations are located within the EVH1 domain (18).

Using MS combined with a tandem affinity purification (TAP)
approach, neurofibromin was identified as a Spred1-interacting
protein (30, 31). Stowe and coworkers performed a detailed anal-
ysis using overexpressed as well as endogenous proteins to suggest
a model for the role of Spred1 in Ras/MAPK inhibition, in which
the EVH1 domain serves as the binding site for neurofibromin; the
complex is then translocated to the plasma membrane via the
Sprouty domain of Spred1. However, it was not clear from that
study which region of the 2,818 residues comprising neurofibromin
is necessary for Spred1 recognition and whether the interaction was
direct or mediated by another cellular factor (31).

In this study, we tested binding of purified recombinant
Spred1(EVH1) to different segments of neurofibromin that were
prepared following recombinant expression in Escherichia coli or
in insect cells. We find that the EVH1 domain binds to the GRD
of neurofibromin with nanomolar affinity and that the interac-
tion is fully compatible with binding of activated Ras without
interfering with RasGAP activity. Furthermore, our study iden-
tifies the extra domain (GAPex) of the GRD as the binding site
of the Spred1(EVH1) domain. GAPex is present in known ca-
nonical RasGAPs but its function has thus far remained unclear.
A mutant neurofibromin harboring a disease-associated single
residue deletion in the identified Spred1-binding site fails to
interact with Spred1 and does not translocate to the plasma
membrane but retains GAP activity, underscoring the physio-
logical importance of this interaction.

Results
Spred1 Binds to the GRD of Neurofibromin and Localizes the Domain
at the Membrane. To define the Spred1(EVH1) binding site on
neurofibromin, we purified recombinant neurofibromin and
soluble segments thereof (schematically shown in Fig. 1A) to

homogeneity and analyzed their interaction with the EVH1 do-
main of Spred1 using an in vitro affinity purification approach.
Immobilized recombinant Spred1(EVH1) captured all neuro-
fibromin protein variants containing the GRD including the
isolated GRD (Fig. 1B). Two LS patient-derived pathogenic
missense mutations T102→R and W31→C (18) located on the
surface of the EVH1 domain prevented the interaction with
GRD-containing fragments (24) (Fig. S1). This result was sup-
ported and confirmed by analysis of several Flag-tagged neuro-
fibromin constructs (Fig. 1A) for their ability to coimmunopre-
cipitate with Spred1 from human embryonic kidney cell lysates
overexpressing both proteins (Fig. 1C). The observed failure of
the constructs containing the N- and C-terminal portions of
neurofibromin to bind but not of those containing the GRD
strongly suggests that no other Spred1 binding site is present on
neurofibromin. Membrane localization, which is a requirement
to inactivate membrane-anchored Ras, is mediated by Spred1/2
(30). To determine whether membrane recruitment of neuro-
fibromin by Spred1 depends on the GRD, we performed bio-
chemical fractionation of human embryonic kidney cells in which
either Spred1 or GFP (as a negative control) was expressed to-
gether with the various Flag-tagged neurofibromin constructs
(Fig. 1D). As expected, Spred1 expression increased the mem-
brane localization of endogenous neurofibromin. For the Flag-
tagged neurofibromin fragments, Spred1 expression specifically
localized the Flag-tagged GRD-containing neurofibromin frag-
ments to the membrane, but not those fragments lacking the
GRD. Thus, our experiments define the GRD of neurofibromin
as the binding site for the Spred1(EVH1) domain.

The GRD of Neurofibromin Forms a Ternary Complex with EVH1 and
Activated Ras. The GRD is probably the best investigated part of
the neurofibromin protein, especially its interaction with and
enzymatic activity toward activated Ras (4, 32–36). We were
interested in whether
the neurofibromin–Spred interaction
competes with Ras recognition or whether the GRD harbors an

Spred1(EVH1) (red triangles). Samples from the reac-
tions were taken at the indicated time points, and the

additional yet unknown protein binding site. To answer this ques-
tion, we prepared recombinant Spred1(EVH1), neurofibromin
(GRD), and Ras bound to the nonhydrolysable GTP analog
GppNHp (referred to as Ras×GppNHp). The integrity of the pu-
rified recombinant proteins was analyzed by MS, revealing masses
of 40,126 (GRD, calculated Mr = 40,125), 13,363 [Spred1(EVH1),
calculated Mr = 13,494], and 18,852 (H-Ras, calculated Mr =
18,853) confirming the expected masses for the GRD and
for H-Ras and indicating cleavage of the N-terminal methionine
(Δm = 132) of Spred1(EVH1). Using these proteins, we per-
formed analytical gel filtration experiments, and we were able
to isolate a stable ternary complex consisting of the GRD,
Ras×GppNHp, and the EVH1 domain of Spred1 [termed
GRD•Ras×GppNHp•Spred1(EVH1)], as well as a binary com-
plex of the GRD and the EVH1 domain of Spred1 [termed
GRD•Spred1(EVH1)] (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). The formation of
the previously characterized GRD•Ras×GppNHp complex was
used as a positive control (4, 33). Thus, both activated Ras and the
Spred1(EVH1) domain can simultaneously bind to the GRD.
Using a multiple angle light scattering (MALS) detector, we de-
termined the molecular masses for the GRD, Spred1(EVH1), and
the binary GRD•Spred1(EVH1) complex eluting in one peak
from a size exclusion column, suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry of the
GRD to Spred1(EVH1).

To quantify the Spred1–neurofibromin affinity, we performed
surface plasmon resonance experiments injecting Spred1(EVH1),
activated Ras (Ras×GppNHp), or inactive Ras [Ras bound to GDP
(referred to as Ras×GDP), as a negative control] over the GRD
immobilized to surfaces (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). Fitting the response
curve for a 1:1 interaction model, as determined by the light scat-
tering analysis, allowed the calculation of a dissociation constant
(Kd) of 7.4 nM for the GRD•Spred1(EVH1) complex and of
6.2 μM for the GRD•Ras×GppNHp complex.

Spred1(EVH1) Binding to the GRD Does Not Affect RasGAP Activity.
The GTPase reaction of Ras has been widely studied in vivo and
in vitro. Because we observed binding of EVH1 to the GRD•Ras
complex, we aimed to analyze potential influences on the cata-
lytic property of the GRD. We set up an in vitro GAP reaction

and monitored the GRD-catalyzed Ras×GTP hydrolysis by
HPLC analysis. Comparison of the reaction rates in the absence
and presence of Spred1(EVH1) did not reveal significant dif-
ferences (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Spred does not modulate the
catalytic activity of the GRD. Consistently, we could isolate a
stable transition state mimicking complex of the GRD and
Ras×GDP in the presence of aluminum fluoride (32) binding to
Spred1(EVH1) (Fig. S4). These data suggest that the interaction
site of Spred on the GRD is distant to and independent of the
Ras binding site.

The Extra Domain of the GRD Contains the Binding Site of Spred1
(EVH1). The simultaneous binding of Spred1(EVH1) and acti-
vated Ras to the GRD raises the question of where the EVH1
binding region is located on the GRD. Proteolysis experiments
and structural analysis of a 333-residue neurofibromin GRD
(NF1-333) revealed a bipartite module consisting of a 230-residue
central domain exhibiting full GAP activity (termed NF230,
GAPc, or GRDmin) and an extra domain (GAPex), formed by
residues located N- and C-terminally to GRDmin (Nex and Cex,
respectively) as schematically outlined in Fig. 3A (33, 37). Because
the Spred1 interaction with the GRD neither influences Ras
binding nor its catalytic GAP activity, we suspected that the lo-
cation of the EVH1 binding site may be on the extra domain.
Overexpression of deletion mutants of the GRD either lacking
the N-terminal or the C-terminal part or the entire GAPex in an
embryonic kidney cell line and immunoprecipitation, as well as
biochemical fractionation experiments, revealed that the extra
domain of the GRD is necessary for interaction with Spred1 and
for membrane recruitment of neurofibromin (Fig. 3 B and C).
Thus, EVH1 binds to the extra domain of the GRD as schemat-
ically shown in Fig. 3D. In addition, a neurofibromin protein
carrying a patient-derived single residue deletion in the N-terminal
part of GAPex (ΔM1215) (38) failed to coimmunoprecipitate
with Spred1 and to localize to the membrane upon Spred1
overexpression (Fig. 3 E and F). Although the NF1 ΔM1215
mutant could not be localized to the membrane by Spred, suf-
ficient overexpression of this mutant, such that it was localized
throughout the cell, showed that NF1 ΔM1215 retains GAP

Discussion
In this study, we show that neurofibromin interacts with Spred1
using its GAP-related domain. In detail, the interaction occurs
via the noncatalytic extra domain of the GRD, is compatible
with Ras binding, and does not affect GAP catalysis. Our study
defines GAPex, the function of which has been unclear, as a
protein-interaction module. The observation that the Spred1
binding region is close to but apparently not overlapping with
the Ras-binding site may point to a Ras-targeting function of
the Spred1–neurofibromin interaction, which is in agreement
with our previous studies, where we showed that Spred1
binding enables neurofibromin to act on Ras in cells, pre-
sumably by bringing neurofibromin into proximity to Ras at
the plasma membrane. Indeed, we showed that loss of func-
tion mutations in Spred1’s C-terminal Sprouty domain could
be rescued by targeting the mutant Spred1 protein to the
plasma membrane with sequences derived from the Ras CAAX
box (30).

We were surprised to discover that Spred1 binds at the GRD
region of neurofibromin because another RasGAP, p120GAP
(RASA1) is recruited to the plasma membrane through a very
different mechanism: SH2 domains bind to phospho-tyrosines
on receptor tyrosine kinases, and so position p120GAP in
proximity to Ras×GTP (39). We therefore might have expec-
ted that Spred1 would bind to a domain elsewhere in the
neurofibromin protein to recruit it to the plasma membrane.
However, Spred proteins are thought to be intimately related
to regulating signal transduction from receptor tyrosine ki-
nases, such as the FGF receptor (40, 41). In contrast, neuro-
fibromin-related proteins are well known in organisms such as
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which, of course, lack tyrosine kinase
signaling altogether. The yeast IRA1 and IRA2 proteins are
the best studied neurofibromin related proteins in distantly
related organisms (42). Therefore, neurofibromin is likely to
play important and highly conserved roles in aspects of cell
physiology that are unrelated to tyrosine kinase signaling, and,
in this sense, it would be surprising if neurofibromin and
IRA proteins shared a domain devoted to Spred1 binding, as
S. cerevisiae lack Spred proteins.

Sequence comparisons and structural studies of canonical
RasGAPs, including p120GAP, synGAP, and neurofibromin,
identify the presence of a GAPex domain that is located next to
the central catalytic GAP domain and forms a conserved struc-
ture (33, 43, 44). Secondary structure prediction analyses of the
IRA1/2 proteins suggest that the extra domain might be con-
served in yeast. We speculate that GAPs may interact with
proteins that perform functions similar to that of Spred1, and we
are actively attempting to identify such novel partners and to
determine their role in GAP and Ras regulation. Spred1 appears
to play a role in positioning neurofibromin at the membrane,
where it can interact with Ras. The localization of Ras to specific
types of membranes is likely cell type dependent, and it is cer-
tainly possible that the regulation of Spred1 recruitment to dif-
ferent types of membranes has an effect on the regulation of Ras
signaling, which will be addressed in future studies. However, the
mechanism by which Spred1 associates with the membrane is not
clear. The Sprouty domain is thought to be palmitoylated and
necessary for membrane anchoring (21). The kit-binding domain
may direct the Spred•neurofibromin complex to specific recep-
tors within the membrane, and, perhaps, binding of Spred1 to the
GAPex domain brings neurofibromin to Ras in a much more
specific manner than by plain membrane recruitment. Our data
represent a step toward a better understanding of the precise
molecular mechanism by which Ras proteins are regulated. De-
fining the mechanistic details of the underlying protein–protein
interactions will have to await the molecular structures of the
complexes identified in this study.

Materials and Methods
Expression Plasmids. The expression constructs encoding recombinant human
NF1 GRD-Sec-PH and NF1 Sec-PH have been previously described (45). A
synthetic gene encoding human neurofibromin (45) was inserted into
pACEBac1 finally encoding an N-terminally His-tagged protein. NF1 GRD
used for in vitro experiments was expressed from a pET21 derivative in
which a synthetic gene encoding residues D1203–H1530 of human neuro-
fibromin preceded by a (His)6 tag was inserted. Flag-tagged neurofibromin
constructs used for transfection experiments in HEK293T cells encoded res-
idues M1-T1175 (NF1 NT), M1-Y1573 (NF1 NT-GRD‡), M1-A1837 (NF1 NT-
GRD-Sec-PH‡), Q1574-A1837 (NF1 Sec-PH‡), R1176-V2818 (NF1 GRD‡-Sec-PH-
CT), K1724-V2818 (NF1 PH-CT), L1838-V2818 (NF1 CT), R1176-Y1573 (NF1
GRD‡), R1176-F1477 (NF1 NexGRDmin), D1248-Y1573 (NF1 GRDminCex), and
D1248-F1477 (NF1 GRDmin) in a pcDNA3.1 vector. Numbering corresponds
to neurofibromin isoform 2 (NP_000258.1). Note: the domain boundaries of the
GRD and the Sec-PH used for transfections differs slightly from the recombi-
nant proteins (NF1 GRD and NF1 Sec-PH) described below and were therefore
labeled NF1 GRD‡ and NF1 Sec-PH‡. Human Spred1 and GFP were expressed
from a pcDNA3.1 vector as described previously (30). A plasmid encoding un-
tagged Spred1(EVH1) (residues S13–S130) was generated by inserting the cor-
responding synthetic gene into pET21d. The same cDNA was also cloned in
pET21d downstream of a gene encoding the IgG binding protein G B1 domain
(46, 47). Point mutations were introduced to generate the pathogenic mutated
(T102→R, W31→C) EVH1 variants of the GB1-fusion proteins. H-Ras (M1-H166)
was expressed from a construct previously described (48).

Preparation of Recombinant Proteins. The expression and purification of NF1
GRD-Sec-PH and NF1 Sec-PH have been previously described (45). Human
neurofibromin was expressed in insect cells (SF21). NF1 GRD used for in vitro
experiments was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3). All recombinant
neurofibromin proteins were purified by metal chelate affinity and pre-
parative size exclusion chromatography. Spred1(EVH1) and mutated forms
(T102→R, W31→C) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3). The in-
troduction of the point mutation was verified by MS. Untagged Spred1
(EVH1) was purified by cation exchange and preparative size exclusion
chromatography. H-Ras (M1-H166) was expressed as previously described
(49) and purified by anion exchange and preparative size exclusion chro-
matography, yielding Ras in the GDP bound state (named Ras×GDP). The
integrity of the recombinant proteins used for the in vitro experiments de-
scribed below was analyzed by electrospray ionization MS.

Ras loaded with guanosine 5′-[βγ-imido]triphosphate (named Ras×GppNHp)
was prepared following the concept described previously (50) but with the
following modifications: Mg2+ was withdrawn from recombinant Ras×GDP
(0.5 mM) by treatment with EDTA (1 mM) to enhance the nucleotide exchange

reaction (49), and released GDP was hydrolyzed by the addition of alkaline
phosphatase in the presence of 200 mM (NH4)2SO4 while GppNHp (added in a
1.5-fold molar excess) was incorporated. After GDP degradation was com-
pleted, as monitored by HPLC analysis, Ras×GppNHp was purified from the
reaction mixture by size exclusion chromatography. Ras in its activated state
(Ras×GTP) was prepared as follows: Ras×GDP was incubated with a molar
excess of EDTA in the presence of GTP (100-fold molar excess) at 273 K for 1 h.
The Ras protein was purified from the excess of nucleotide by size exclusion
chromatography, yielding between 50% and 74% Ras×GTP.

In Vitro Interaction Assay. Bacterial lysates generated from GB1-Spred1(EVH1)
expression cultures were incubated with IgG-sepharose. The resins were
washed in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2,
2 mM DTT, and 2% (vol/vol) glycerol and purified recombinant neuro-
fibromin proteins were added. After a 30-min incubation at 273 K, the resins
were washed again using the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in
SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS/PAGE [4–12% (wt/vol) acryl
amide gradient].

Immunochemical Analysis and Biochemical Fractionation. HEK293T cells were
grown in DMEM with 10% (wt/vol) bovine calf serum and grown to 70%
confluency at the time of transfection. Cells were transfected with Lip-
ofectamine 2000 and cultivated for another 24–48 h. For immunoprecipi-
tation experiments, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH
7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1% (vol/vol) Triton-X100, 1 mM DTT, and
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For biochemical fractionation, cells
were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer [10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM DTT, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors], kept
on ice for 20 min, and then passaged through a 25-G needle 15 times. Nuclei
and unbroken cells were then removed by centrifugation at 100 × g for
3 min; the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 100 mM, and the supernatant
was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the membrane
fraction. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for
30 min to clear the cytoplasmic fraction. Membrane pellets were resus-
pended in SDS/PAGE sample buffer. The generated fractions were analyzed
by Western blotting. The Spred1 antibody was from Abcam; the neuro-
fibromin, p120GAP, H-Ras, and tubulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; and the FLAG, ERK, and K-Ras antibodies were from Sigma.

Analytical Gel Filtration. GRD, Ras×GppNHp, and Spred1(EVH1) were each
diluted to 100 μM and injected into a Superdex 200 increase 5/150 analytical
SEC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0)
containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgCl2. Proteins were UV detected at 280
nm, and additionally, the molecular weight of the eluted species was de-
termined by multiple angle light scattering (MALS) using a miniDAWN
TREOS detector (WYATT). For analysis of complex formation, proteins were
mixed at 100 μM each in the same total volume and analyzed under identical
conditions. A similar experiment was performed using Ras×GDP in the
presence of an equimolar amount of aluminum ions (Al3+) and a 330-fold
excess of fluoride together with the GRD and Spred1(EVH1). The protein
content of the collected fractions was analyzed by SDS/PAGE [15% (wt/vol)
acrylamide] and subsequent Coomassie staining. Blue dextran and a protein
standard mixture were run under the same conditions to determine the void
volume v0 of the size exclusion column and the elution volume of the size
reference proteins.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments. A Ni2+-loaded NTA sensor chip in a
BiacoreX100 system (GE Healthcare) was coated with the His-tagged GRD
in 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% (vol/
vol) polysorbate 20. For experiments including Ras, the buffer was sup-
plemented with 1 mM MgCl2. The second flow cell with immobilized Ni2+
ions was used as a reference surface. Dilution series in the range between 5
and 200 nM of Spred1(EVH1) and 700 nM and 50 μM of Ras×GppNHp
(positive control) or Ras×GDP (negative control) were prepared and in-
jected. The dissociation constant Kd was determined by nonlinear fitting of
the sensorgrams to a 1:1 interaction model using Biacore X100 software
(version 2.0.1). At least two independent titration experiments were per-
formed, and results were averaged.

GAP Assays. Ras×GTP samples (20–100 μM Ras×GTP in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT) were incubated at 293 K in the
absence or presence of the GRD (molar ratio of GRD to Ras×GTP 1:2,000) or the
GRD together with an 100-fold excess of Spred1(EVH1) relative to the GRD.
Samples were taken after 40, 90, and 180 s and heat denatured for 60 s at
95 °C. The released nucleotide was qualified by reversed phase HPLC as

concentrations between 1 and 100 μM and protein samples from the GAP re-
actions were analyzed in triplicates. GAP activity was determined in three in-
dependent experiments for each of the experimental setups. The initial loading
state of Ras×GTP was set to 100%. The SEM was calculated using the formula
SEM =
with n = 3. EGF stimulation and measurement of
GAP activity from 293T lysates was performed as described previously (30).
