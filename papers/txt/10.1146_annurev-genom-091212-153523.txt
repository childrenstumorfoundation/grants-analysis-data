Abstract
The RASopathies are a clinically deﬁned group of medical genetic syndromes
caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components or regula-
tors of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These
disorders include neuroﬁbromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syn-
drome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation–arteriovenous mal-
formation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome,
and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK path-
way dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping pheno-
typic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulat-
ing the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all
of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising
that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on
both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway
has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule
inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ame-
liorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays a vital role in development and
is activated by extracellular input in the form of growth factors (Figure 1). RAS genes constitute
a multigene family that includes HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS. Ras proteins are small guanosine
nucleotide-bound GTPases that function as a critical signaling hub within the cell. They are
activated through growth factors binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein-coupled
receptors, cytokine receptors, and extracellular matrix receptors. Ras proteins cycle between an
active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Activation through RTKs occurs
with the binding of a growth factor that causes RTK autophosphorylation and interaction with
the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2). GRB2 is bound to son of
sevenless (SOS), which is then recruited to the plasma membrane. SOS proteins are guanosine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that increase the Ras nucleotide exchange rate of GDP for
GTP, thereby increasing the level of active GTP-bound Ras.

The MAPK pathway is one of several critical downstream signaling cascades of Ras. Activated
Ras leads to the activation of Raf (ARAF, BRAF, and/or CRAF), the ﬁrst MAPK kinase kinase of the
pathway. Raf phosphorylates and activates the MAPK kinases MEK1 and/or MEK2; these in turn
phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and/or ERK2. ERK1 and ERK2 are the ultimate effectors and

exert their function on a large number of downstream molecules, both nuclear and cytosolic. ERK1
and ERK2 substrates include nuclear components, transcription factors, membrane proteins, and
protein kinases that in turn control vital cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, cellular
differentiation, and cellular growth (69).

The Ras/MAPK pathway has been studied extensively in the context of oncogenesis because
its somatic dysregulation is one of the primary causes of cancer. Ras is somatically mutated in
approximately 20% of malignancies (8), and BRAF is somatically mutated in approximately 7%
of malignancies (for a review, see 39). Because of this, the RASopathies are considered cancer
syndromes, with the majority of associated mutations resulting in enhanced pathway activation
or dysregulated signaling. However, biochemical studies have demonstrated that a large fraction
of the novel germline mutations identiﬁed in the pathway are not as robustly activating as those
associated with oncogenesis. This is likely due to the embryonic lethality arising from these
germline mutations.

2. THE RASOPATHIES
The RASopathies are a class of developmental disorders caused by germline mutations (as op-
posed to the somatic mutations found in cancer) in genes that encode components or regulators
of the Ras/MAPK pathway. The Ras/MAPK pathway is one of the best-studied signal transduc-
tion pathways and is critical in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and
senescence, all of which are essential to normal mammalian development (Figure 1). Therefore,
it is not surprising that its dysregulation can have profound consequences in development.

Each RASopathy exhibits a unique phenotype, but owing to the common mechanisms of
Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, they share many overlapping characteristics, including cran-
iofacial dysmorphology; cardiac malformations; cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormal-
ities; neurocognitive impairment; hypotonia; and an increased cancer risk. Taken together, they
are one of the largest known groups of malformation syndromes, affecting approximately 1 in 1,000
individuals. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) was the ﬁrst syndrome identiﬁed as being caused by
mutation of a gene in the Ras/MAPK pathway (NF1) (11, 63, 65), and numerous other syndromes
have subsequently been identiﬁed. These disorders include (a) Noonan syndrome (NS), caused
by activating mutations in PTPN11 (59), SOS1 (46, 60), RAF1 (38, 44), KRAS (51), NRAS (15),
SHOC2 (16), and CBL (34, 35); (b) Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), caused by
mutations in PTPN11 (18) and RAF1 (38); (c) capillary malformation–arteriovenous malformation
syndrome (CM-AVM), caused by haploinsufﬁciency of RASA1 (20); (d ) Costello syndrome (CS),
caused by activating mutations in HRAS (5); (e) cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC), caused
by alteration of MAPK pathway activation by activating mutations in BRAF (36, 48) and MAP2K1
(MEK1) or MAP2K2 (MEK2) (48); and ( f ) Legius syndrome, caused by inactivating mutations in
SPRED1 (10).

2.1. Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1
NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 newborns, with approx-
imately half of NF1 individuals inheriting the mutation from a parent (for a review, see 67). The
clinical diagnosis of NF1 is based on the presence of caf´e-au-lait maculae, intertriginous freckling,
neuroﬁbromas and plexiform neuroﬁbromas, iris Lisch nodules, osseous dysplasia, optic pathway
glioma, and/or a ﬁrst-degree relative with NF1 (Figure 2, Table 1). Although these are the signs
and symptoms most commonly associated with NF1, individuals with NF1 may have other man-
ifestations of the disorder, including cardiac malformations, cardiovascular disease, vasculopathy,

hypertension, vitamin D deﬁciency, brain malformations, and seizures. They may also have dys-
morphic craniofacial features reminiscent of NS (27, 57), mild neurocognitive impairment, and a
predisposition to developing certain malignancies. Segmental and mosaic forms of NF1 are not
uncommon, and gonadal mosaicism has been documented.

NF1 was the ﬁrst multiple congenital anomaly syndrome to be associated with a germline
mutation in the Ras/MAPK pathway. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, with approx-
imately half of the mutations being de novo (12, 63, 65). NF1 encodes neuroﬁbromin, which is a
RasGAP, i.e., a GTPase-activating protein that is a negative regulator of Ras (Figure 1, Table 1).
NF1 mutations result in neuroﬁbromin loss of function, causing haploinsufﬁciency within the
cell. This in turn reduces RasGTPase activity and therefore results in an overall increase in
active GTP-bound Ras. Because of this, NF1 is a cancer predisposition syndrome (for a re-
view, see 9). Individuals with NF1 are at greater risk than the general population for developing

malignancies. Pediatric malignancies include optic pathway glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuro-
blastoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, whereas adult malignancies include malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, somatostatinomas, pheochro-
mocytomas, and breast cancer.

2.2. Noonan Syndrome
NS is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects approximately 1 in 1,000–2,000 newborns. Al-
though it has a variable clinical phenotype, NS is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features,
including a broad forehead, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral ﬁssures, and low-set, poste-
riorly rotated ears (Figure 2, Table 1). Other important phenotypic features include congenital
cardiac defects, reduced growth, bleeding disorders, and a variable degree of neurocognitive delay
(for a review, see 49). In addition, individuals with NS have an increased risk of developing cancer.
At present, seven genes have been shown to be associated with NS: PTPN11 (59), SOS1 (46, 60),
RAF1 (38, 44), KRAS (51), NRAS (15), SHOC2 (16), and CBL (34, 35). All of these genes harbor
heterozygous germline mutations and encode various components of or proteins associated with
the Ras/MAPK pathway (Figure 1, Table 1).

The most common gene associated with NS is PTPN11, which accounts for approximately
50% of all cases (59). SHP2, the protein product of PTPN11, is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) composed of N- and C-terminal SH2 domains and a catalytic PTP domain.
The majority of NS-causing missense mutations in PTPN11 cluster in residues involved with the
interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains. Mutations in this region disrupt the stability
of the catalytically inactive form of SHP2, impairing the protein’s ability to switch from the active
to the inactive conformation (28, 58) and causing increased signaling of the Ras/MAPK pathway.
SOS1 missense mutations are the second-most-common cause of NS, accounting for ap-
proximately 15% of cases (46, 60). SOS1 encodes the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(RasGEF) protein SOS1, which is responsible for stimulating the conversion of Ras from the
inactive GDP-bound form to the active GTP-bound form. The majority of SOS1 missense
mutations are located in codons encoding residues responsible for stabilizing the protein in an
inhibited conformation. These mutations disrupt the autoinhibition of SOS1 RasGEF activity,
resulting in a SOS1 gain of function, a subsequent increase in the active form of Ras, and increased
Ras/MAPK pathway signaling.

KRAS mutations are a rare cause of NS (51). KRAS encodes two splice variants, KRASA and
KRASB; KRASA is expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc and developmentally restricted fashion, whereas
KRASB is ubiquitously expressed. The novel KRAS mutations that cause NS increase signaling
of the Ras/MAPK pathway through one of two distinct mechanisms: mutations that reduce
the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity (50, 51) or mutations that interfere with the
binding of KRAS and guanine nucleotides. The resultant increased signaling of the Ras/MAPK
pathway is, however, less than that which occurs with oncogenic KRAS-activating mutations
(51). Although most clinical geneticists would agree that individuals with a KRAS mutation have
a clinical phenotype consistent with NS, there are some individuals who have a more severe
phenotypic manifestation consistent with CFC (see below).

Mutations in NRAS have also been found in a very small number of individuals with the NS
clinical phenotype (15). Mutations have been identiﬁed within or near the switch II region of NRAS
and are thought to interfere with GTPase function. Mutations cause enhanced phosphorylation
of MEK and ERK.

Mutations in RAF1 also cause NS (38, 44). RAF1 encodes the protein RAF1 (a.k.a. CRAF), a
serine/threonine kinase that is one of the direct downstream Ras effectors. The majority of RAF1

mutations associated with NS cluster in two regions: conserved region 2 (ﬂanking S259) and
conserved region 3 (surrounding the activation segment). These mutations result in a CRAF gain
of function because the phosphorylation of residues S259 and S621 is responsible for regulation
of CRAF.

A rare subset of NS individuals with a unique phenotypic feature of loose anagen hair has
recently been identiﬁed as caused by a single mutation in SHOC2, which results in a p.S2G sub-
stitution (16). SHOC2 is a homolog of suppressor of clear (SOC-2) in Caenorhabditis elegans, which
encodes a protein whose primary structure consists almost entirely of leucine-rich repeats. SHOC2
functions as a scaffold protein linking Ras to RAF1, its downstream effector in the Ras/MAPK
pathway. SHOC2 is ubiquitously expressed and serves as the regulatory subunit of protein phos-
phatase 1C (PP1C) (47). SHOC2 binds RasGTP and mediates PP1C translocation to the cell
membrane. This enables PP1C dephosphorylation of residue S259 of RAF1, which is required
for RAF1 translocation to the cell membrane and catalytic activity. The unique p.S2G mutation
is proposed to cause the abnormal addition of a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid chain, myristate,
to the N-terminal glycine of SHOC2. This results in the aberrant translocation of SHOC2 to
the cell membrane, prolonged PP1C dephosphorylation of RAF1, and sustained MAPK pathway
activation (16).

Another rare cause of NS is mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CBL (34, 35). Individuals
may also have myeloproliferative diseases, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which
is seen in individuals with NF1 as well as those with NS. CBL encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase
that negatively regulates the Ras/MAPK signaling downstream of RTK (19). CBL mediates the
association of ubiquitin with activated RTK, which is necessary for receptor internalization and
degradation (19). Because mutations in CBL reduce the turnover of activated RTK, they have an
overall effect of increased ERK activation.

2.3. Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines
NSML (formerly referred to as LEOPARD syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder.
Individuals have the craniofacial features of NS as well as multiple lentigines, electrocardiogram
abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal genitalia, growth re-
tardation, and deafness. NSML and NS are allelic disorders, caused by different heterozygous
missense mutations in the same genes, PTPN11 (18, 32) and RAF1 (38) (Figure 1, Table 1).
The most common NSML-associated PTPN11 mutations affect amino acids in the catalytic PTP
domain, which results in reduced SHP2 catalytic activity in vitro, causing a loss of function (18,
29). However, an in vivo Drosophila model has demonstrated that the residual catalytic activity in
the NSML mutant SHP2 protein is sufﬁcient to produce a gain-of-function phenotype owing to
dysregulation of the protein, causing continuous MAPK pathway activity during development (37).

2.4. Capillary Malformation–Arteriovenous Malformation Syndrome
CM-AVM is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by multifocal capillary mal-
formations, which may be associated with arteriovenous malformations and ﬁstulas (for a review,
see 7). CM-AVM is caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in RASA1 (20), which, like
NF1, encodes a RasGAP, speciﬁcally the p120-RasGAP (Figure 1, Table 1). The N terminus
contains a Src (sarcoma) homology region, and the C terminus contains a pleckstrin homology
domain and the RasGTPase-activating domain. Like neuroﬁbromin, the protein product of NF1,
RASA1 switches the active GTP-bound Ras to the inactive GDP-bound form. It is a negative
regulator of the Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway that is important for cellular growth,
differentiation, and proliferation.

The major feature of this syndrome is the multifocality of the malformations. Arteriovenous
malformations can occur in many tissues, including skin, muscle, bone, and various internal organs,
including the heart and the brain. RASA1 mutations have also been associated with individuals di-
agnosed with Parkes Weber syndrome and vein of Galen malformations (45). Haploinsufﬁciency
of p120-RasGAP reduces the hydrolysis of RasGTP and therefore increases Ras/MAPK pathway
signaling. Most individuals with CM-AVM have an affected parent; however, ∼30% of cases are
caused by a de novo mutation. The types of mutations vary, with the majority being nonsense,
frameshift, or splice mutations. In addition to arteriovenous malformations, individuals may have
cardiovascular malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot, septal defects, and valve anomalies. In-
terestingly, CM-AVM patients may be at increased risk of developing tumors similar to those seen
in NF1 and NF2, although this is not entirely clear at this point.

2.5. Costello Syndrome
CS, one of the rarer RASopathies, is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome that has many
overlapping features with the other syndromes. CS individuals have characteristic dysmorphic
craniofacial features; failure to thrive, especially in the newborn period; cardiac, musculoskeletal,
ectodermal, and ocular abnormalities; hypotonia; and variable neurocognitive delay (for a review,
see 40) (Figure 2, Table 1). Phenotypic features become apparent in the perinatal period
with polyhydramnios in utero, and many children are born prematurely and have an increased
birth weight. Facial features are coarse and typically include macrocephaly with a prominent
forehead, epicanthal folds, down-slanting palpebral ﬁssures, a short nose with a depressed nasal
bridge and broad base, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears with thickened helices and lobes.
The cheeks may be full and the mouth large with full lips. Dermatologic manifestations aid in
the clinical diagnosis of CS, and include soft skin with excessive wrinkling and redundancy over
the dorsum of the hands and the feet along with deep plantar and palmar creases (53). The majority
of CS individuals have cardiac anomalies, which may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM), valve anomalies, septal defects, and arrhythmia (33). Failure to thrive and gastrointestinal
dysfunctions such as reﬂux, oral aversion, and constipation are typical in early infancy; most
patients require a gastronomy tube for feeding.

CS is caused by heterozygous activating germline mutations in HRAS (5) (Figure 1, Table 1).
The distribution of mutations reveals that more than 80% of CS individuals have a p.G12S
substitution; the second-most-common substitution is p.G12A (for a review, see 61). These sub-
stitutions disrupt guanine nucleotide binding and cause a reduction in intrinsic and GAP-induced
GTPase activity, resulting in Ras remaining in the active state (22). Less frequently observed
HRAS mutations may also occur, which may result in an atypical phenotype. It is interesting that
amino acid positions 12 and 13, the two most common positions mutated in CS, are also the most
frequently mutated positions in oncogenic Ras. Ras mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61 are present
in approximately 20% of all tumors (8).

As with many of the other RASopathies, individuals with CS are at increased risk of developing
neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Benign growths commonly seen in CS are cutaneous
papillomas (53), which are observed in ∼72% of CS individuals, with age of onset ranging from
infancy to 22 years. The most commonly reported location of papillomas is the nose, although they
may occur anywhere on the body. Importantly, these neoplasms are not seen in other RASopathies.
Of great concern is that approximately 15–20% of individuals with CS develop malignancies, with
the most common being rhabdomyosarcoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (23).
Interestingly, rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma are common childhood malignancies,
whereas transitional cell carcinoma is not. The most commonly reported malignancy in CS is

embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, in which loss of heterozygosity of wild-type HRAS has been
reported (21). The origin of constitutional germline mutations causing CS reﬂects a paternal
bias (56, 70). Somatic mosaicism has been identiﬁed in CS, although it is rare (25). Also, there
has been one case of reported autosomal dominant transmission (55) and one case of reported
gonadal mosaicism (24).

2.6. Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous Syndrome
CFC, like CS, is rare, and it has many overlapping phenotypic features with NS and CS. CFC
individuals have NS-like facies, including macrocephaly, a broad forehead, bitemporal narrowing,
hypoplasia of the supraorbital ridges, down-slanting palpebral ﬁssures with ptosis, a short nose with
a depressed nasal bridge and anteverted nares, a high-arched palate, and low-set, posteriorly rotated
ears with prominent helices (Figure 2, Table 1). Ectodermal ﬁndings typically consist of sparse,
curly hair with sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, hyperkeratosis, keratosis pilaris, hemangioma,
ichthyosis, and progressively forming nevi (54). Cardiac anomalies are similar in frequency to
those of NS and CS, with the most prevalent being pulmonic stenosis, septal defects, and HCM.
Musculoskeletal abnormalities are common, as are ocular abnormalities, including strabismus,
nystagmus, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Failure to thrive is typical in infancy, as are
gastrointestinal dysfunctions such as reﬂux, vomiting, oral aversion, and constipation. Neurologic
abnormalities are universally present to varying degrees and include hypotonia, motor delay,
seizures, speech delay, and/or learning disability (68).

Four genes that encode proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway downstream of Ras have been
associated with CFC syndrome: BRAF (36, 48), MAP2K1 (MEK1) and MAP2K2 (MEK2) (48), and
KRAS (36) (Table 1). The role of KRAS in CFC remains unclear because KRAS mutations were
also identiﬁed in individuals clinically diagnosed with NS (51). Heterozygous BRAF mutations are
found in approximately 75% of mutation-positive CFC individuals (for a review, see 62). BRAF is a
serine/threonine protein kinase and one of the direct downstream effectors of Ras. It is also a known
oncoprotein, with somatic mutations reported in several different types of malignancies, including
thyroid, lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancers; however, the majority of CFC-associated mutations
are novel. Unlike the cancer-associated mutations, the majority of CFC BRAF mutations cluster
in the cysteine-rich domain in exon 6 and in the protein kinase domain, with the most common
CFC BRAF mutation being p.Q257R. In vitro functional analyses of the BRAF mutant proteins
have demonstrated that most have increased kinase activity; however, a few mutant proteins have
kinase-impaired activities (36, 48). BRAF kinase impairment also increases signaling of the MAPK
pathway through CRAF (26). Further in vivo studies of CFC mutations have demonstrated that
both kinase-active and kinase-impaired mutations result in similar phenotypic dysregulation of
MAPK signaling in a zebraﬁsh model (3).

Heterozygous missense mutations in MAP2K1 (MEK1) and MAP2K2 (MEK2) are present in
approximately 25% of CFC individuals in which a gene mutation has been identiﬁed (for a review,
see 62). MEK1 and MEK2 are threonine/tyrosine kinases, with both isoforms having the ability to
phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2. Functional studies of MEK mutant CFC proteins
have shown that all are activating (3, 48).

CFC syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner (43). Because it is very rare
for individuals with CFC to reproduce, the vast majority of cases result from a de novo dom-
inant mutation. Although the mutations that cause CFC are in a well-known oncogenic path-
way, it is still unclear whether individuals with CFC are at an increased risk for malignancies.
CFC certainly does not appear to have the malignancy risk associated with NF1, NS, and CS
(31, 43).

2.7. Legius Syndrome
Legius syndrome (formally called NF1-like syndrome) is a relatively newly described autoso-
mal dominant RASopathy. It shares many phenotypic features with NF1 as well as with other
RASopathies. Individuals may have caf´e-au-lait maculae, intertriginous freckling, mild neurocog-
nitive impairment, and macrocephaly, with some having dysmorphic craniofacial features reminis-
cent of NS. However, the neoplastic features common in NF1, such as neuroﬁbromas, plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, iris Lisch nodules, and central nervous system tumors, do not seem to be associated
with this syndrome.

Legius syndrome is caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in SPRED1 (10) (Figure 1,
Table 1). SPRED1 encodes SPRED1, which has a SPROUTY-related, N-terminal enabled/VASP
homology 1 (EVH1) domain. SPRED1 functions as a negative regulator of Ras by inhibiting
phosphorylation of Raf (64). The vast majority of SPRED1 mutations associated with Legius
syndrome cause truncation of the protein, resulting in a SPRED1 loss of function and dysregulated
signaling of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Although several patient series have been published, it
remains unclear whether individuals with germline SPRED1 mutations are at increased risk for
developing cancer (17).

3. CONSIDERATIONS FOR SYSTEMIC TREATMENT
OF GERMLINE EFFECTS
Work on treating germline phenotypic features of RASopathies with pathway modulation or
small-molecule inhibition is under way. One common feature of the RASopathies is some degree
of neurocognitive involvement, which is an attractive target for treatment (1). The ﬁrst random-
ized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial examined the effect of a 12-week simvastatin
treatment on cognitive function in children with NF1 (30). Sixty-two children from 8 to 16 years
old were treated with simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutamyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor
that interferes with the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway as well as Ras isoprenylation, the lat-
ter of which decreases Ras activity. Preliminary and secondary outcomes were designed to test
numerous neuropsychologic, neurophysiologic, and neuroradiologic effects. No signiﬁcant dif-
ference was found between the treatment and control groups, and the authors concluded that the
treatment did not improve cognitive function of NF1 children as designed in this trial.

Another clinical trial examined lovastatin treatment in children with NF1 (2). Twenty-four
children from 10 to 17 years old were treated for three months with escalating doses of lovastatin
to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the drug. The primary outcome showed that the vast majority
of the children developed decreased cholesterol levels, but no levels fell below the normal range
for the age group. Neurocognitive secondary outcomes demonstrated signiﬁcant improvement in
verbal and nonverbal memory and visual attention and efﬁciency. In an add-on study using func-
tional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a subset of NF1 children treated with lovastatin
showed an increase in long-range positive resting-state functional connectivity within the default
network of the brain, similar to that seen in the brain of typically developing children (13).

In addition to the treatment of germline NF1 phenotypic features, other RASopathy treat-
ments are candidates for clinical trials. An NS phase II clinical trial is currently recruiting
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). This is a proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the effect of the MEK
inhibitor MEK162 (Novartis) on adults with NS who also have HCM. The primary outcome mea-
sure will be the change of baseline left ventricular mass as determined by MRI; the goals are to
examine the safety and tolerability of treatment with MEK162 over six months, evaluate the phar-
macokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MEK162, and evaluate the therapeutic concept that MEK
inhibition will reduce cardiac hypertrophy in NS individuals with HCM.

Like NF1 and NS, the possible treatment of CS and CFC holds great promise (41). CS and
CFC are two of the rarest RASopathies, with estimates of several hundred individuals in each
group worldwide. The identiﬁcation of HRAS mutations as the molecular cause of CS raised the
possibility that farnesyl transferase inhibitors may provide clinical beneﬁt to patients. These drugs
inhibit the enzyme that transfers the farnesyl group onto Ras and other proteins, and were initially
developed as potential anticancer agents targeting Ras function (for a review, see 6). The use of
MEK inhibitors to treat phenotypic manifestations in individuals with CFC has sparked much
discussion as well (41, 42). MEK inhibitors are generally non-ATP competitive and bind in an
interior hydrophobic pocket that is adjacent to but distinct from MEK’s ATP binding site. MEK
inhibitors were developed for cancer treatment but have, unfortunately, made little impact in can-
cer clinical trials to date. Their use in animal models has shown promise in treating germline effects
of Ras/MAPK activation (14, 52, 66), and the utilization of low-level MEK inhibition to partially
reduce Ras/MAPK activation and achieve moderate developmental effects may be effective (4).

4. CONCLUSIONS
The RASopathies, which are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding components or
regulators of the Ras/MAPK pathway, emphasize the essential role that this critical signal trans-
duction pathway plays in embryonic and postnatal development. Mutations identiﬁed in these
syndromes result in dysregulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and functional studies have deter-
mined that the vast majority enhance pathway signaling. Therefore, it is not surprising that many
of these syndromes exhibit overlapping phenotypic features and share a predisposition for certain
malignancies. The number of different genes affected and the variety of mutations within each
gene are reﬂected in the wide spectrum of phenotypic variability associated with these syndromes.
Although many of the activating mutations are similar to somatic mutations associated with can-
cer, they tend to not be as strongly activating. It is likely that the strongly activating oncogenic
mutations cannot be tolerated within the germline or in early development.

The initial diagnosis for a patient with a given RASopathy is based on the clinical recognition of
phenotypic features, with molecular genetic testing then used to conﬁrm the clinical diagnosis. The
correlation between the clinical and molecular diagnoses often depends on the clinical diagnostic
criteria. In addition, not all of the genes associated with these syndromes have been identiﬁed.
The progressive accumulation of genotype-phenotype correlations will increase the importance of
molecular diagnosis and help overcome the intrinsic limitations of clinical diagnosis. This will not
only improve patient management but also aid in the design of clinical trials to develop potential
treatments for these syndromes.

SUMMARY POINTS
1. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays a vital role in development and is activated by extracellular

input in the form of growth factors. This pathway has been well studied in cancer.

2. The RASopathies are a clinically deﬁned group of medical genetic syndromes caused by
germline mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/MAPK
pathway. These syndromes include neuroﬁbromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noo-
nan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation–arteriovenous malfor-
mation, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome.

3. The RASopathies are one of the largest known groups of malformation syndromes,

affecting approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals.

4. Although many of the activating Ras/MAPK pathway mutations are similar to somatic
mutations associated with cancer, they tend to not be as strongly activating. It is likely
that the strongly activating oncogenic mutations cannot be tolerated in the germline or
in early development.

5. Because the Ras/MAPK pathway has targets for inhibition in cancer treatment, many
small-molecule therapeutics are in development or undergoing clinical trials. The use
of systemic therapies after birth to reduce Ras/MAPK activity in the RASopathies could
potentially ameliorate the progression of signs and symptoms associated with these
disorders.

FUTURE ISSUES
1. Not all of the genes associated with the RASopathies have been identiﬁed; it is therefore

critical to continue identifying associated genes.

2. Additional clinical trials in RASopathies are needed to examine possible treatment of

developmental defects.

3. Although the RASopathies share a predisposition for certain malignancies, it is unclear
why some syndromes and individuals have an increased cancer risk compared with others.
4. As the RASopathies are a newly deﬁned group of medical genetic syndromes, it will be
important to continue studying their natural history to assist in deﬁning the best medical
practices for each.
