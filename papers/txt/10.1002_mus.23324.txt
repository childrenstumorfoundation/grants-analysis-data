conditions due to alterations of
the Ras/MAPK pathway.
Neurocutaneous findings are hallmark features of the RASopa-
thies, but musculoskeletal abnormalities are also frequent. The
objective was to evaluate handgrip strength in the RASopathies.
Methods:
(e.g., Noonan
syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous [CFC]
syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]) and healthy
controls were evaluated. Two methods of handgrip strength
were tested: GRIP-D Takei Hand Grip Dynamometer and the
Martin vigorimeter. A general
linear model was fitted to com-
pare average strength among the groups, controlling for con-
founders such as age, gender, height, and weight. Results:
Takei dynamometer: handgrip strength was decreased in each
of the syndromes compared with controls. Decreased handgrip
strength compared with sibling controls was also seen with the
(P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Handgrip

strength is decreased in the RASopathies. The etiology of the
reduced muscle force is unknown, but likely multifactorial.

The RASopathies consist of distinct syndromes
which are due to mutations in genes involved in
regulation of
the Ras/mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway.1 Examples of these causa-
tive genes include NF1, HRAS, BRAF, MEK1/2,
PTPN11, KRAS, RAF1, SOS1, and SPRED1. Multiple
organ systems are affected in the RASopathies, and
there is variable phenotypic overlap. Some of these

neous syndrome (CFC), Costello syndrome (CS),
Legius syndrome, capillary malformation-arteriove-
nous malformation syndrome, and multiple lenti-

range of common (e.g., NF1, NS) to very rare
genetic disorders (e.g., CS, CFC). As a group, most
primary care physicians will likely follow patients
with RASopathies in their clinical practices.

if they fulﬁlled the NIH clinical diagnostic crite-
ria.14 Control subjects were healthy individuals or
siblings of participants without a known syndrome
or orthopedic condition. Individuals who could
not follow the commands of the measurement pro-
tocol due to cognitive impairment or age were not
included.

Written informed consent was obtained, and
the study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Utah and the University
of California at San Francisco.

Measurements. Handgrip strength was
initially
obtained using the GRIP-D Takei Hand Grip Dyna-
mometer instrument per protocol instructions for
the Takei Physical Fitness Test (GRIP-D item#
5101, Takei Scientiﬁc Instruments Co., LTD, To-
kyo, Japan) in a cohort of individuals with NF1,
CS, CFC, NS, and healthy controls (Cohort #1). In
brief, individuals were in an upright position and
held the dynamometer in 1 hand with the grip
range adjusted so that the second joint of the fore-
ﬁnger is bent through 90 degrees. The instrument
was then held down at the participant’s side with-
out letting the arm touch the body with the arm
fully extended. Individuals were then asked to
exert full force with the hand for approximately 3
seconds to obtain the maximum kilogram-force
(kgf), during which verbal encouragement was pro-
vided. A total of 4 measurements were obtained,
alternating from the right hand, to the left hand,
to the right hand, and back again to the left hand
with approximately 30 seconds rest between each
measurement. The average of the 4 measurements
for each individual was used. The reported
measurement
the GRIP-D Takei
dynamometer instrument is 5.0 to 100 kgf with a
minimum unit of 0.1 kgf. The reported measuring
accuracy of the instrument is 6 2 kgf in 50 kgf.

Because the Takei dynamometer requires the
participant to generate a minimum of 5 kgf, we

using the Martin vigorimeter.15 NF1 individuals
were not available during the measurements with
the Martin vigorimeter. There was an overlap of 5
individuals with Costello syndrome in the cohort
using the Takei dynamometer and the cohort
using the Martin vigorimeter, but there was no
overlap in the individuals with NS, CFC, or con-
trols. These data from the Martin vigorimeter were
collected 2 years after collection of data from the
Takei dynamometer from the initial cohort. The
medium bulb was used for all studies, and meas-
urements were all performed consistently (B.A.T.
or K.A.R.). Each participant was placed with the
forearm on the table with the wrist in the neutral
position. Three measurements were obtained in
succession from the self identiﬁed dominant hand.
Participants were asked to ‘‘squeeze the bulb as
hard as you can’’ and were further encouraged
during the task. There were approximately 10
seconds of rest between each reading. Height and
weight were not available in this cohort.

Statistical Analysis. For data generated from the
Takei dynamometer, a general linear model was ﬁt-
ted to compare average strength score among the
5 groups, controlled for possible confounders such
as age, gender, height, and weight. Tukey-Kramer
multiple-comparison
were
obtained. The statistical analyses were performed

Carolina). For data generated from the Martin
vigorimeter a similar comparison was performed

handgrip strength values measured in kilopascals
(kPa) for each syndrome were lower than the aver-
age score for the normal sibling controls (Fig. 2).
Differences were signiﬁcant after Tukey-Kramer
multiple-comparison adjusted P-values: CFC (P <
0.0001), CS (P < 0.0001), and NS (P < 0.0001)
(Table 2). The model also showed a signiﬁcant
interaction between age and groups (which indi-
cates handgrip strength increases by age, but
much faster in the controls than all other syn-
dromic groups), but gender was not statistically sig-
niﬁcant, and height and weight were not available
for inclusion in the model.

DISCUSSION
All of the Ras/MAPK syndromes that we tested
had decreased generation of muscle force using
both the handgrip Takei dynamometer and the
Martin vigorimeter. This is in concordance with
clinical observations of weakness, hypotonia,
impaired motor proﬁciency, delayed motor mile-
stones, and decreased muscle mass in many of the
RASopathies.2,7 This study provides objective data
to suggest that disturbance of Ras signaling leads
to skeletal muscle weakness, which likely contrib-
utes to the various clinical musculoskeletal ﬁndings
broadly observed in the RASopathies. The etiology
of the reduced muscle force is not known, but it is
likely multifactorial.

A general linear model was ﬁtted to compare
average forearm strength among the 5 groups with
controls for possible confounders such as age, gen-
der, height, and weight. All syndromic groups had
signiﬁcantly
square mean strength
scores than the control group (see Table 1). Differ-
ences were still signiﬁcant after Tukey-Kramer mul-
tiple-comparison adjusted P-values: CFC (P <
0.0001), CS (P < 0.0001), NF1 (P ¼ 0.0005), and
NS (P ¼ 0.0053). Other notable group differences,
after Tukey-Kramer adjustment, showed decreased
strength in CS compared with NF1 (P ¼ 0.0021)
and CS compared with NS (P ¼ 0.0591). The
model also showed that height (P < 0.0001) and
weight (P ¼ 0.0005) were signiﬁcantly associated
with average strength scores, but age and gender
were not signiﬁcant (although age was signiﬁcant
in a univariate analysis, but not after controlling
for height and weight, which is consistent with
older subjects being bigger).

To address the fact that a few individuals were
unable to generate enough force on the Takei dy-
namometer, we used the Martin vigorimeter to
measure handgrip pressure in children 18 years
and younger on an additional group of CS, CFC,
and NS participants (Cohort #2). All raw averages

muscle development. With in vitro studies, Tidy-

grip strength test performed was an isometric mea-
sure of only 2 maximal forces per muscle groups
and hence was unlikely to lead to signiﬁcant lactic
acidosis and impaired function directly from the
test. However, mitochondrial dysfunction may
result in chronic fatigue and impaired metabolic
efﬁciency with subsequent muscle atrophy and
weakness over time, which in turn would attenuate
the typical age-related increase in strength over
time.

Souza et al. speculated that vitamin D and cal-
cium concentrations and other metabolic differen-
ces potentially contribute to decreased muscular
forces in NF1.5 Vitamin D deﬁciency has been asso-
ciated with decreased muscle function in the gen-
eral population,20 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deﬁ-
ciency has been reported in some individuals with
NF1,21 but this has not been systematically assessed
in the other RASopathies.

It is also possible that joint laxity, hypotonia,
and hand anomalies potentially could have inter-
fered with the functional generation of maximal
force with the dynamometer that was selected
which requires a self generated voluntary task. In
addition, cognitive deﬁcits may have contributed
to the ability to accurately follow commands dur-
ing the handgrip strength measurement protocol
leading to suboptimal muscle force production.
The range of cognitive function varies between
and within the syndromic groups and makes it dif-
ﬁcult to determine if subjects’ cognitive function
impacted the performance of the task. Cognitive
deﬁcits in NF1 and Noonan syndrome that would
impair the performance of a simple task would be
rare but are not as unlikely in CFC and CS, which
may explain the decreases in CS compared with
NF1 and NS. However, we excluded participants
who were unable to follow commands to perform
the handgrip measurement. A few individuals
were unable to generate enough force to reach
the minimum measurement range of 5.0 kgf for
the dynamometer used, resulting in a recorded
value of 0 kgf. It is likely that some force was pro-
duced, although it did not reach the minimum
measurement range and could potentially bias the
overall group values. However, eliminating indi-
viduals with a score of 0 kgf would also provide
bias. We elected to include individuals who fol-
lowed commands
to complete the procedure,
although no force was recorded on the Takei
dynamometer.

measured on additional groups of CS, CFC, and
NS children using the Martin vigorimeter. The
Martin vigorimeter measures spherical grip pres-
sure and is deemed a reliable device for use in
children15 and the elderly as it is less dependent
on hand anthropometry.22 It has been compared
and validated against other dynamometers.22–24
Using the Martin vigorimeter, we measured hand-
grip strength on cognitively impaired children as
young as 4 years of age and conﬁrmed decreased
strength in a separate cohort. All individuals eval-
uated were able to generate some measurable
force with the Martin vigorimeter. There was a
small overlap of participants in both cohorts for
individuals with CS but no overlap in the other
groups. In addition, the measurements of the 5
overlapping CS individuals in which the Martin vig-
orimeter was used were performed 2 years after

Decreased physical activity levels based on ques-
tionnaires have been reported in some of
the
RASopathies.25 Whether or not an inherent muscle
abnormality leads to decreased physical activity, or
decreased physical activity due to other issues
results in subsequent weakness, is difﬁcult to deter-
mine. Increased bone resorption markers have also
been reported in NF1, CS, CFC, and NS,25 which
potentially could be a secondary effect of abnor-
mal muscle function and subsequent decrease in
load bearing activities. Therefore muscle weakness
could be a contributing factor to the osteopenia
and osteoporosis observed in several of
the
RASopathies.

This

study provides objective evidence of
decreased strength using a handgrip dynamometer

decreased strength in addition to the known mus-

that physical therapy and/or occupational therapy
assessments should be considered for patients. It is

with subsequent improvement in quality of life. In
addition, we theorize that the frequency and onset
of many of the musculoskeletal abnormalities asso-

hip dysplasia, scoliosis, and contractures, might be
improved if muscle strength and tone could be
