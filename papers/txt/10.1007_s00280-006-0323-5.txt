Abstract The MEK–mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)  signal  transduction  pathway  is  involved  with
numerous  cellular  processes  including  cell  growth  and
diVerentiation. Phosphorylation of MAPK (pMAPK) by
MEK  results  in  activation  of  this  pathway.  In  various
solid  tumors,  the  MEK–MAPK  pathway  is  constitu-
tively  active;  therefore  inhibition  of  this  pathway  may
provide  a  therapeutic  strategy  for  treating  cancer.  The
objective of this study was to determine the extent and
duration of inhibition of pMAPK in selected normal tis-
sues  in  rats  following  single  oral  or  intravenous  (IV)
doses  of  the  novel  MEK  inhibitor,  PD0325901.  Male
Sprague–Dawley  rats  (9/group)  received  either  single
oral  (PO)  or  IV  doses  of  PD0325901  at  10,  30,  or
100 mg/kg (60, 180, and 600 mg/m2, respectively). Con-
trols  received  vehicle  alone  which  was  aqueous  0.5%
hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose/0.2%  Tween  80  for  PO
dosing  and  20%  beta-cyclodextran  sulfobutyl  ether  in
water (w:v) for IV dosing. Animals (3/group/day) were
euthanized on Days 2, 3, and 4, at approximately 24, 48,
and  72 h  after  dosing,  respectively.  The  eVects  on
pMAPK in liver and lung were determined by Western
blot  analysis  and  compared  with  plasma  PD0325901

levels.  Satellite  animals  (6/dose/route)  received  single
PO or IV doses and serial blood samples were collected
for  determination  of 
toxicokinetic  parameters  of
PD0325901  and  its  major  metabolite.  In  general,  sys-
temic exposure to PD0325901 was comparable between
routes of administration due to high PO bioavailability
(56–109%).  Plasma  area  under  the  concentration–time
curve  values  of  the  pharmacologically  inactive  carbox-
ylic  acid  metabolite  ranged  from  18  to  40%  of
PD0325901. Clinical signs of toxicity occurred at 100 mg/
kg  PO  or  IV,  indicating  the  maximum-tolerated  dose
had  been  achieved.  On  Day  2,  pMAPK  was  inhibited
57–95%  in  liver  and  86–99%  in  lung  at  all  doses,  irre-
spective  of  route  of  administration.  On  Day  3,  lung
pMAPK remained inhibited 75–91% at all IV doses and
by  88%  after  the  100-mg/kg  PO  dose.  Liver  pMAPK
remained inhibited 79 and 91% on Day 3 after 100 mg/
kg  by  IV  and  PO  doses,  respectively.  On  Day  4,  liver
pMAPK was still inhibited 66% after the 100-mg/kg PO
dose. The EC50 and EC90 plasma drug levels for inhibi-
tion of lung pMAPK were calculated to be 20 and 99 ng/
ml, respectively. Liver pMAPK levels were inhibited at
least 50% at plasma PD0325901 concentrations ¸50 ng/
ml. In conclusion, single PO or IV doses of PD0325901
resulted  in  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  pMAPK  in
liver and lung. Inhibition of pMAPK in liver was compa-
rable  between  routes  of  administration  at  ·30 mg/kg,
whereas  inhibition  of  pMAPK  in  lung  occurred  for  a
longer  duration  following  IV  administration.  Measure-
ment of pMAPK in normal tissues served as a means for
assessing the pharmacologic activity of PD0325901 and
should be included in toxicity studies to evaluate toxic-
ity–pharmacology relationships.

Introduction

The  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  signal
transduction  pathways  control  key  cellular  processes
such  as  growth,  diVerentiation,  and  proliferation,  and
provide  a  means  for  transmission  of  signals  from  the
cell  surface  to  the  nucleus.  As  a  part  of  the  RAS–
RAF–MEK–MAPK  pathway,  MEK  (MAP  kinase
kinase) phosphorylates the MAPK proteins ERK1 and
ERK2  (extracellular  signal-regulated  kinases)  [15].
Although MEK has not been identiWed as having onco-
genic properties, this kinase serves as a focal point in
the  signal  transduction  pathway  of  known  oncogenes
(e.g.,  RAS)  [10].  Aberrant  activation  of  this  pathway
has been observed in a diverse group of solid tumors,
and  is believed  to  play  a  key  role  in neoplasia  [5].  In
addition to solid tumors, constitutive activation of the
MEK/MAPK pathway appears to be involved with the
pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia [12].

Based  on  a  signiWcant  amount  of  preclinical  data,
development  of  small  molecule  inhibitors  of  MEK
appears to be a rational approach for treatment of var-
ious  malignancies  [3,  17].  The  Wrst  MEK  inhibitor  to
enter  clinical  trials  was  CI-1040  (also  known  as
PD0184352), and was intended for oral administration.
The  Phase 1 study with CI-1040 demonstrated inhibi-
tion  of  phosphorylated  ERK  (pERK)  in  peripheral
blood  mononuclear  cells  and  tumor  samples,  along
with  evidence  of  objective  antitumor  activity  (partial
response in pancreatic cancer) [1]. However, the level
of antitumor activity in a multicenter Phase 2 study in
patients with various solid tumors was not suYcient to
warrant  further  development  [14].  CI-1040  exhibited
low  oral  bioavailability  and  high  metabolism,  which
were  primary  factors  resulting  in  insuYcient  plasma
drug levels for antitumor activity.

PD0325901  (Fig. 1)  is  a  highly  potent  and  speciWc
non-ATP  competitive  inhibitor  of  MEK  (Ki  of  1 nM
against activated MEK1 and MEK2 in vitro), and dem-
onstrates anticancer activity against a broad spectrum
of  human  tumors  in  murine  models  [18].  Preclinical
studies  indicate  that  PD0325901  has  the  potential  to
impair growth of human tumors that rely on the MEK/
MAPK pathway for growth and survival. Recent stud-
ies  have  indicated  that  tumors  with  BRAF  mutations
may  be  particularly  sensitive  for  growth  inhibition
upon exposure to a MEK inhibitor such as PD0325901
[19]. This compound has greatly improved pharmaco-
logic and pharmaceutical properties compared with CI-
1040 (i.e., greater potency for MEK inhibition, higher
bioavailability, and increased metabolic stability), and
has signiWcant promise for determining the therapeutic
potential for treating cancer with an orally active MEK

inhibitor [14, 18]. A Phase 1/2 trial has been initiated in
breast,  colon,  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  and  mela-
noma  patients  in  which  PD0325901  is  administered
orally twice daily [8].

A key aspect in developing “targeted” therapies for
cancer  involves  verifying  biochemical  activity  of  the
drug against the putative target, and correlating phar-
macologic  activity  with  exposure  and  eYcacy  [4].  By
demonstrating  inhibition  of  the  biochemical  pathway
of  interest,  pharmacodynamic  relationships  can  be
developed in which dose level, schedule, and route of
drug  administration  can  be  selected  to  increase  the
likelihood of clinical response to therapy. By determin-
ing  a  dose  and/or  regimen  that  results  in  optimum
activity against a molecular target rather than the max-
imum-tolerated  dose,  clinical 
toxicity  may  be
decreased.  Therefore,  the  development  of  analytical
methods for measuring and/or evaluating the intended
biochemical  eVects  of  drug  exposure  (biomarkers)  is
critical for achieving these goals.

This  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  extent
and  duration  of inhibition  of MAPK  phosphorylation
(pMAPK) in normal rat tissues (liver, lung) following
either  a  single  oral  or  intravenous  (IV)  dose  of
PD0325901. These tissues were selected for evaluation
because  they  are  highly  perfused,  provide  suYcient
sample  size,  and  readily  allow  protein  isolation.  In
addition, the MEK–MAPK pathway is present in both
liver and lung [5, 6]. Plasma drug levels were examined
along  with  inhibition  of  tissue  pMAPK  and  compari-
sons were made between oral and IV dosing.

Materials and methods

Drug

PD0325901 was synthesized by PWzer Global Research
and Development, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. The chemi-
cal  name  (IUPAC)  of  PD0325901  is  N-((R)-2,3-dihy-
droxy-propoxy)-3,4-diXuoro-2-(2-Xuoro-4-iodo-phenyl-
amino)-benzamide.

PD0325901 was prepared for oral administration as
a  suspension  in  aqueous  0.5%  hydroxypropylmethyl-
cellulose/0.2% Tween 80 at concentrations of 2–20 mg/
ml.  For  IV  administration,  PD0325901  was  dissolved
(sonication used) in 20% beta-cyclodextran sulfobutyl

ether (SBECD) in water (w:v) at concentrations of 2–
20 mg/ml, and Wlter-sterilized through a 0.2-♯m Wlter

Animals

Male  Sprague–Dawley  (Crl:CD[SD]IGS  BR)  rats
obtained  from  Charles  River  Laboratories  were
assigned to this study and were approximately 8 weeks
old and weighed approximately 230–285 g at initiation
of  dosing.  Animals  were  housed  individually  in  stain-
less steel wire mesh cages and acclimated to the labora-
tory  environment  for  6  or  7  days  prior  to  dosing.
Standard  procedures/conditions  applied  for  animal
care,  feeding,  and  maintenance  of  room,  caging,  and
environment.  Animals  were  fed  powdered  Lab  Diet
(5002) CertiWed Rodent Diet ad libitum and water was
supplied ad libitum via an automatic system. This study
was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  current  guide-
lines  for  animal  welfare  (National  Research  Council
Guide  for  the  Care  and  Use  of  Laboratory  Animals,
1996). The procedures used in this study were reviewed
and approved by the PWzer Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.

Experimental design

The  doses  selected  for  this  study  were  based  upon
results  obtained  from  acute  PD0325901  oral  and  IV
toxicity studies in rats. In the acute IV study, lethality
occurred  at  400 mg/kg,  clinical  signs  of  toxicity
(decreased  skin  turgor,  fecal  staining,  soft  feces,
mucoid  feces,  hypoactivity,  rough  pelage,  skin  sore,
and  urine staining) and weight loss  at  200 mg/kg, and
minimal  eVects  at  100 mg/kg.  In  the  acute  oral  study,
lethality occurred at ¸300 mg/kg and reversible toxic-
ity  (clinical  signs  of  chromodacryorrhea,  decreased
skin turgor, diarrhea, soft feces, red staining of muzzle,
rough  pelage,  and  urine  staining;  and  weight  loss)
occurred at 100 mg/kg. The mechanism(s) for lethality
in  these  studies  is  unknown.  Based  upon  these  data,
oral  and  IV  doses  of  10,  30,  and  100 mg/kg  were
selected for the study. These doses were expected to be
non-lethal, provide a range of plasma drug levels, and
generate dose–response data with regards to inhibition
of  tissue  pMAPK  levels.  In  addition,  100 mg/kg  was
expected  to  provide  exposure  and  pharmacodynamic
data  near  the  maximum-tolerated  dose  (MTD)  by
either the oral or IV routes of administration.

A total of 108 rats were randomly assigned by body
weight  (determined  pretest)  to  treatment  groups.
Treatment groups were comprised of either 9 animals/
group for controls (for both oral and IV vehicles) or 15
animals/group for PD0325901 administration (for both

oral  and  IV  dosing).  All  vehicle  control  animals  and
the  Wrst  nine  animals  in  each  PD0325901  dose  group
were  designated  for  pharmacodynamic  assessment
(i.e.,  evaluation  of  tissue  pMAPK  levels)  as  follows:
three  animals/group  were  necropsied  approximately
24,  48,  and  72 h  after  dosing  (on  Days  2,  3,  and  4,
respectively). The remaining six animals in each drug-
treated group were designated for toxicokinetic assess-
ment.  Animals  in  the  oral  treatment  groups  received
vehicle  alone  or  PD0325901  by  gavage  in  a  dose  vol-
ume  of  5 ml/kg.  Animals  in  the  IV  treatment  groups
received vehicle alone or PD0325901 in the tail vein in
a  dose  volume  of  5 ml/kg  (at  a  rate  of  approximately
1 ml/min). The required volume of vehicle or drug for-
mulation for each animal was based on individual body
weight determined prior to dosing on Day 1. All  ani-
mals were observed approximately 1 and 4 h postdos-
ing,  and  once  daily  thereafter  for  clinical  signs  of
toxicity.

Toxicokinetic parameters were assessed on Day 1 in
animals designated for toxicokinetic assessment. Blood
samples  (approximately  1 ml)  were  collected  at
approximately 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, and 24 h after oral dosing.
Each  PO  drug-treated  animal  was  sampled  at  three
time points. The same animals were sampled at the fol-
lowing  time  points:  1,  4,  and  12 h;  and  2,  7,  and  24 h
after oral dosing. In IV dosed animals, blood samples
(approximately 1 ml) were collected at approximately
5 and 30 min, and 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after dosing. Each
IV  drug-treated  animal  was  sampled  at  three  time
points. The same animals were sampled at the follow-
ing  time  points:  5 min,  2  and  12 h;  and  30 min,  6  and
24 h after IV dosing. Blood samples were collected into
a tube containing EDTA as the anticoagulant, immedi-
ately placed on ice, and centrifuged (refrigerated). The
plasma  was  separated  and  stored  frozen  at  ·¡20°C
prior to analysis. Following collection of the last blood
sample,  animals  designated  for  toxicokinetic  assess-
ment  were  euthanized  and  discarded.  Plasma  con-
centrations  of  PD0325901  (R  and  S  enantiomers
combined;  both  pharmacologically  active;  achiral
method)  and  the  inactive  carboxylic  acid  metabolite,
PD315209,  were  determined  using  a  validated  liquid
chromatographic  procedure  with  tandem  mass  spec-
trometry detection (LC/MS/MS) with a lower limit of
quantitation of 1 ng/ml. Composite concentration–time
proWles were constructed and the toxicokinetic param-
eters derived included maximum concentration (Cmax),
time-to-Cmax (Tmax), and area under the concentration–
time curve (AUC). Concentrations below the limit of
quantitation  were  reported  as  zero  (0)  and  used  in
evaluation  of  mean  concentrations  and  estimation  of
AUC.  For  each  dose  level,  oral  bioavailability  was

123

calculated by dividing AUC(0–24) after PO dosing by
AUC(0–24)  after  IV  dosing,  and  expressed  as  a  per-
centage.

Three  animals/group  designated  for  pharmacody-
namic  evaluation  were  euthanized  (carbon  dioxide
asphyxiation) for tissue collection at approximately 24,
48,  and  72 h  after  dosing.  Representative  samples  of
liver and lung were collected from all animals. Tissue
samples  were  frozen  in  liquid  nitrogen  and  stored  at
¡70°C prior to preparation of tissue lysates and mea-
surement of total and pMAPK levels by Western blot
analysis. Blots were probed for pMAPK using a poly-
clonal antibody that detects the phosphorylated forms
of  both  ERK1  and  ERK2  (Cell  Signaling  Technolo-
gies),  which  are  two  isoforms  of  MAPK.  Blots  were
then stripped and re-probed using a pair of polyclonal
antibodies that detect ERK1 and ERK2 (Santa Cruz)
regardless of phosphorylation state (total MAPK). For
both  pMAPK  and  total  MAPK,  signal  was  generated
via a secondary goat antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated  IgG  (Santa  Cruz)  in  combination  with
chemiluminescent  substrate  (Pierce).  Signal  was
detected  and  measured  digitally  using  a  Bio-Rad
Fluor-S  Max  Imaging  System.  The  ratio  of  pMAPK/
total  MAPK  was  determined  for  each  sample  to  nor-
malize  the  pMAPK  signal  to  the  total  amount  of
MAPK protein analyzed.

Blood  samples  were  collected  from  animals  desig-
nated for pharmacodynamic evaluation at termination
(24, 48, or 72 h postdose). Samples (approximately 3–
5 ml)  were  collected  into  tubes  containing  EDTA  as
the anticoagulant, immediately placed on ice, and cen-
trifuged (refrigerated). The plasma was separated and
stored  frozen  at  ·¡20°C  prior  to  analysis  of  plasma
concentrations  of  PD0325901  and  PD315209  as
described above. Blood samples collected from vehicle
control  animals  were  discarded.  Mean  percent  inhibi-
tion  of  pMAPK  in  liver  or  lung  was  plotted  against
mean plasma PD0325901 concentration, at that respec-
tive time point, and analyzed using either simple Emax
or  sigmoid  Emax  models.  The  analysis  was  conducted
irrespective of route of administration. In cases where
the mean pMAPK/total MAPK ratio for a given dose
group was  greater than the concurrent  control, it was
considered that no inhibition occurred and a value of
zero was used in the analysis.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted on individual animal
pMAPK/total  MAPK  data.  Treatment  comparisons
were  performed  on  rank-transformed  data  using  a
dose-trend test sequentially applied at the two-tailed 1

123

and 5% signiWcance levels within one-factor analysis of
variance. Dunnett’s test replaced the sequential trend
test if the overall linear trend test was not signiWcant at
the  5%  level  and  a  quadratic  trend  was  signiWcant  at
the 1% level. All parameters were analyzed separately
for each route of administration, time period, and tis-
sue (liver or lung). The pMAPK/total MAPK ratio for
liver or lung was averaged within each dose group and
time point, and expressed as a percentage of the con-
current  control  ratio  (mean  percent  of  control).  Data
are presented as the mean percent of control for liver
and  lung  pMAPK  to  indicate  whether  PD0325901
administration  resulted  in  a  decrease  (inhibition),  no
change, or increase in pMAPK proteins.

Results

Clinical observations

No deaths occurred and clinical signs of toxicity were
similar  following  oral  or  IV  administration.  Clinical
signs were Wrst observed on Day 2. Oral administration
at 100 mg/kg resulted in ataxia, hypoactivity, red stain-
ing  of  the  muzzle,  and  soft/reduced  feces.  Reduced
feces were also seen after an oral dose of 30 mg/kg, and
soft feces were observed at 10 and 30 mg/kg. IV admin-
istration at 100 mg/kg produced hypoactivity, red stain-
ing of the muzzle, and soft/reduced feces. Soft/reduced
feces  were  observed  at  30 mg/kg,  and  clinical  signs
were  not  seen  following  a  10 mg/kg  IV  dose.  These
clinical  signs  are  relevant  for  rats  and  indicate  that  a
MTD had been achieved at 100 mg/kg by both routes
of  administration.  The  MTD  can  be  considered  the
dose  at  which  further  increases  above  it  would  likely
result in morbidity, mortality, or inhumane conditions
of stress in the test animal. Clinical signs occurred in a
dose-dependent  fashion,  which  was  supported  by
increased exposures with increasing dose levels.

a Inactive carboxylic acid metabolite

In  vitro  metabolism  data  have  indicated  that
PD0325901 undergoes glucuronidation and oxidation
of the parent molecule, with a similar metabolic pro-
Wle  between  rat  and  human  liver  microsomes  and
hepatocytes  (unpublished  data).  The  carboxylic  acid
metabolite  PD315209  is  believed  to  be  formed  by
enzymes  other  than  cytochrome  P450.  Although
PD315209 was comparably potent to the parent drug
with  inhibiting  puriWed  MEK1,  the  metabolite  was
signiWcantly  less  potent  in  a  cell-based  assay  com-
pared  with  PD0325901  (IC50  values  of  1.3 ♯M  and
0.59 nM,  respectively,  for  inhibiting  pERK  in  tumor
cells) and had decreased activity in vivo. The carbox-
ylic acid metabolite may have decreased potential to
enter cells and is considered to be pharmacologically
inactive in vivo.

sented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Representative
Western  blots  are  presented  in  Figs. 3  and  4.  Oral
administration  of  PD0325901  produced  dose-depen-
dent  inhibition  of  liver  and  lung  pMAPK  levels.  On
Day 2, pMAPK was inhibited 57, 84, and 95% in liver,
and 92, 95, and 99% in lung at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg,
respectively. Inhibition of tissue pMAPK was not evi-
dent after Day 2 following oral doses at 10 or 30 mg/
kg. However, pMAPK levels were inhibited on Days
3 and 4 in liver (66–91%), and on Day 3 in lung (88%)
in the 100-mg/kg dose group. For each dose and route
of  administration, 
tissue  pMAPK
declined with decreasing plasma drug levels, demon-
strating  the  reversible  nature  of  target  inhibition  by
PD0325901.

Intravenous  administration  of  PD0325901  also
resulted  in  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  pMAPK  in
liver and lung. On  Day 2, pMAPK was inhibited 57,

123

the  change  was  not  signiWcant.  Inhibition  of  tissue
pMAPK  was  not  evident  on  Day  4.  On  Day  4,  lung
pMAPK levels were increased 77 and 226% in the 10
and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively. Although the rea-
son for this change is uncertain, it may have been due
to low lung pMAPK values in the concurrent vehicle
control group and/or represent experimental variabil-
ity within the data set, as a clear dose–response rela-
tionship was not evident.

Blood  samples  collected  at  approximately  48  and
72 h  after  dosing  indicated  prolonged  exposure  to
PD0325901,  irrespective  of  route  of  administration
(Table 5). Plasma levels of PD315209 from 24 to 72 h
after dosing are presented in Table 6. The relationship
between inhibition of tissue pMAPK and plasma drug
levels  was  examined.  Plasma  PD0325901  concentra-
tions and inhibition of pMAPK in lung were Wtted to a
sigmoid  Emax  model  (Fig. 5).  Maximum  inhibition
(Emax) was determined to be 98% with associated EC50
and  EC90  values  of  20.4  and  99.1 ng/ml,  respectively.
The  relationship  between  plasma  PD0325901  concen-
trations  and  inhibition  of  liver  pMAPK  could  not  be
adequately  described  with  either  simple  Emax  or  sig-
moid Emax models due to variability in the data. How-
ever,  liver  pMAPK  was  consistently  inhibited  by  at
least  50%  at  plasma  PD0325901  concentrations
¸50 ng/ml (Fig. 6).

Discussion

This study was conducted to determine whether a single
oral or IV dose of PD0325901 inhibits pMAPK in liver

and lung, and the duration of inhibition. Both routes of
administration were initially evaluated for potential clin-
ical development. Subsequently, an oral formulation of
PD0325901  was  selected  for  clinical  development.
Plasma  drug  levels  were  related  to  the  pharmacologic
activity  of  the  drug  and  comparisons  were  made
between oral and IV dosing. In general, systemic expo-
sure to PD0325901, as determined by AUC(0–24), was
comparable between both routes of administration due
to high oral bioavailability (56–109%). This is notewor-
thy  because  many  drug  candidates  fail  in  development
due  to  inadequate  pharmacokinetic  properties.  Inhibi-
tion  of  tissue  pMAPK  occurred  at  PD0325901  plasma
AUC(0–24)  ¸21.5 ♯g h/ml.  Clinical  signs  of  toxicity
occurred  at  the  high  dose  (100 mg/kg),  irrespective  of
the route of administration, and indicated that the MTD
had  been  achieved.  The  dose-related  clinical  observa-
tions were supported by the dose-related increase in sys-
temic exposure.

Both  oral  and  IV  administration  of  PD0325901
inhibited pMAPK in liver and lung. These tissues were
selected  for  evaluation  because  they  are  highly  per-
fused, provide suYcient sample size, readily allow pro-
tein isolation, and have constitutive levels of pMAPK.
These tissues were considered as surrogates for tumor
tissue  and  provided  a  means  for  evaluating  the  phar-
macologic activity  of  a  MEK  inhibitor  in  a naive  ani-
mal. In the liver, inhibition of pMAPK was comparable
between  routes  of  administration  at  10  and  30 mg/kg.
However,  inhibition  of  liver  pMAPK  occurred  to  a
slightly greater extent and longer duration following an
oral dose of 100 mg/kg, compared to the same dose by
IV administration. This diVerence may have been due
to the  Wrst-pass eVect whereby drug delivery from the
portal circulation after oral administration resulted in
an  initially  high  exposure  of  the  liver  to  PD0325901.
Plasma drug levels at the 24-, 48-, and 72-h time points
were  also  higher  at  100 mg/kg  following  oral  dosing,
which  could  have  accounted  for  the  greater  extent  of
pMAPK inhibition.

In the lung, inhibition of pMAPK lasted longer fol-
lowing  IV  administration  of  PD0325901.  An  oral
10 mg/kg  dose  with  Cmax  and  AUC(0–24)  values  of
4.57 ♯g/ml  and  21.5 ♯g h/ml,  respectively,  inhibited
lung pMAPK levels for less than 48 h. Conversely, an
IV dose of 10 mg/kg with Cmax and AUC(0–24) values
of  26.3 ♯g/ml  and  27.8 ♯g h/ml,  respectively,  inhibited
lung  pMAPK  levels  through  48 h.  Similar  diVerences
were  also  observed  at  the  30-mg/kg  dose  level.  The
longer duration of inhibition observed with IV dosing
may be due to the higher Cmax value.

The relationship between plasma PD0325901 levels
and inhibition of pMAPK in lung was examined by use

123

of a sigmoid Emax model and the EC50 and EC90 values
were  20.4  and  99.1 ng/ml,  respectively.  These  values
are very similar to the EC50 and EC90 values (16.5 and
86 ng/ml,  respectively)  for  inhibition  of  pMAPK  in
colon 26 tumors (murine-derived tumor) implanted in
mice  receiving  a  single  dose  of  PD0325901  [16].  In
SCID  mice  implanted  with  various  human  tumors,
PD0325901 was administered daily and tumor growth
and  pMAPK  levels  were  evaluated  in  comparison  to
plasma  drug  levels.  In  that  study,  PD0325901  plasma
drug concentrations of 100 ng/ml demonstrated signiW-
cant  pharmacologic  activity  [7].  PD0325901  inhibited
pMAPK in rat liver at plasma concentrations ¸50 ng/
ml. These data suggest that PD0325901 inhibits MEK
in rat tissues at similar plasma concentrations that have
demonstrated pharmacologic activity in various murine
tumor models.

It is becoming more apparent that clinical utility of
molecularly  targeted  therapies  for  the  treatment  of
various cancers is dependent upon demonstrating bio-
chemical activity of the candidate drug on the pathway
intended for manipulation [4]. By demonstrating inhi-
bition of the biochemical pathway of interest, pharma-
codynamic  relationships  can  be  developed  in  which
dose level, schedule, and route of drug administration
can  be  selected  to  provide  a  rational  means  for  non-
clinical  testing  and  clinical  use  of  the  drug  [11,  13].
With molecularly targeted therapies, doses for clinical
testing may be selected based upon maximum biologi-
cal eVect rather than MTD. This is especially applica-
ble for those agents associated with tolerable toxicity in
the clinical setting, an example of which is the mono-
clonal  antibody  against  the  epidermal  growth  factor
receptor, cetuximab [9]. In the current study, Western
blot  analysis  was  used  to  demonstrate  inhibition  of
MEK in two distinct normal tissues in the rat following
PD0325901 administration. This technique provided a
biomarker for measuring the degree of pharmacologic
activity of PD0325901 following in vivo exposure, and
was subsequently used in non-clinical toxicology stud-
ies of PD0325901 to demonstrate pharmacologic activ-
ity of the drug over a range of doses [2]. By including
biomarkers  such  as  these  in  toxicology  studies,  rela-
tionships  between  exposure,  pharmacologic  activity,
and toxicity endpoints can be evaluated together. This
provides a means for developing potential safety mar-
gins  of  targeted  therapies.  Western  blot  analysis  of
whole tissue homogenates provides a means for quanti-
tating  biochemical  inhibition  of  targeted  pathways.
Alternative  methodologies  for  biomarker  evaluation
are also available, including immunohistochemistry. A
combination  of  Western  blot  analysis  (peripheral
blood  mononuclear  cells)  and  immunohistochemistry

123

(tumor samples) was used to assess the pharmacologic
activity of the predecessor MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, in
a Phase 1 trial [1]. In a Phase 1 study of PD0325901 in
patients with various solid tumors, inhibition of MEK
was evaluated by using immunohistochemistry to mea-
sure pERK in tumor biopsies collected before and dur-
ing  drug  treatment.  Doses ¸2 mg  bidaily  (2.5 mg/m2)
consistently suppressed tumor pERK by an average of
84%  relative  to  baseline,  and  doses  ¸15 mg  bidaily
(18.5 mg/m2)  yielded  average  steady-state  plasma
concentrations  >250 ng/ml  which are  predicted  neces-
sary for near maximal pERK suppression in xenograft
models [8].

In conclusion, single oral or IV doses of PD0325901
resulted  in  dose-dependent  decreases  in  pMAPK  in
liver and lung, due to inhibition of MEK. Inhibition of
pMAPK  in  liver  was  generally  comparable  between
routes  of  administration,  whereas 
inhibition  of
pMAPK in lung occurred for a longer duration follow-
ing  IV  administration  of  PD0325901,  possibly  due  to
higher PD0325901 plasma Cmax.
