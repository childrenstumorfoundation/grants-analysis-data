Abstract

Hippo signaling acts as a master regulatory pathway controlling growth, proliferation, and
apoptosis and also ensures that variations in proliferation do not alter organ size. How the
pathway coordinates restricting proliferation with organ size control remains a major unan-
swered question. Here we identify Rae1 as a highly-conserved target of the Hippo Pathway
integrating proliferation and organ size. Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila cells
and tissues and in mammalian cells indicate that Hippo signaling promotes Rae1 degrada-
tion downstream of Warts/Lats. In proliferating cells, Rae1 loss restricts cyclin B levels and
organ size while Rae1 over-expression increases cyclin B levels and organ size, similar to
Hippo Pathway over-activation or loss-of-function, respectively. Importantly, Rae1 regula-
tion by the Hippo Pathway is crucial for its regulation of cyclin B and organ size; reducing
Rae1 blocks cyclin B accumulation and suppresses overgrowth caused by Hippo Pathway
loss. Surprisingly, in addition to suppressing overgrowth, reducing Rae1 also compromises
survival of epithelial tissue overgrowing due to loss of Hippo signaling leading to a tissue
“synthetic lethality” phenotype. Excitingly, Rae1 plays a highly conserved role to reduce the
levels and activity of the Yki/YAP oncogene. Rae1 increases activation of the core kinases
Hippo and Warts and plays a post-transcriptional role to increase the protein levels of the
Merlin, Hippo, and Warts components of the pathway; therefore, in addition to Rae1 coordi-
nating organ size regulation with proliferative control, we propose that Rae1 also acts in a
feedback circuit to regulate pathway homeostasis.

Rae1 Is Targeted by the Hippo Pathway and May Act in a Highly Conserved Feedback Circuit

Author Summary

Exquisite control of organ size is critical during animal development and its loss results in
pathological conditions. The Hippo Tumor Suppressor Pathway coordinates regulation of
proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and autophagy to determine and maintain precise control
of organ size. However, the genes responsible for Hippo-mediated regulation of mitosis or
coordination of proliferation within organ size control have evaded characterization.
Here, we describe Rae1, an essential WD-repeat containing protein, as a new organ size
regulator. By genetic analysis, we show that Rae1 acts downstream of the Hippo Pathway
to regulate mitotic cyclins and organ size. In contexts where organ size control is lost by
compromised Hippo signaling, we show that there is a requirement for Rae1 that is dis-
tinct from the requriement for Yki: reducing Yki levels causes suppression of overgrowth,
while reducing Rae1 levels dramatically compromises the survival of Hippo-deficient tis-
sue. Lastly, our studies of Rae1 uncovered a potential post-transcriptional feedback loop
that reinforces Yorkie-mediated transcriptional feedback for the Hippo Pathway.

Introduction
The Hippo Pathway (also called the Salvador-Warts-Hippo Pathway) plays a well-appreciated
and strongly conserved developmental role in establishing and maintaining organ size. Aberra-
tions in signaling pathways can increase rates of cellular growth or proliferation, but once
appropriate organ size is reached, what is coming to be called an “organ size checkpoint” blocks
further growth and proliferation; organs do not overgrow unless these aberrations also bypass
the “organ size checkpoint” [1]. The precise nature of the signal that restricts cell division in
response to organ size checkpoint activation remains unknown. Given that loss of Hippo sig-
naling (1) results in both tissue and organ overgrowth in Drosophila and vertebrates and (2) is
implicated in a range of cancers including colorectal cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, lung can-
cer, leukemia, and ovarian cancer [2–11; for review see 12–19], elucidating this link between
proliferation control and organ size control within the Hippo Pathway has important implica-
tions for development and disease.

The Hippo Pathway consists of a core cassette: Hippo (Hpo), Warts (Wts), Salvador (Sav)

and Mats [19–25]. Hpo (homologous to mammalian Mst1 and Mst2), the upstream serine/
threonine kinase in the cassette, phosphorylates the scaffold protein Sav (hWW45 or SAV1 in
mammals), the downstream kinase Wts (Lats1 and Lats2 in mammals), and Wts co-activator
Mats (Mob1 in mammals). Activated Wts then phosphorylates transcriptional co-activator
Yorkie (Yki) (YAP and TAZ in humans) [26] promoting its cytoplasmic retention where it can-
not regulate transcription of cell death, cell division, and cell growth regulators such as DIAP1,
cyclin E, and others [27–28]. The pathway is also subject to feedback through Yki/YAP-depen-
dent transcription of upstream regulators such as Merlin (Mer) and expanded (ex) in Drosoph-
ila tissues [26, 29], and Lats2 and NF2 in mammalian cultured cells [30]. The core components
and Yki/YAP thus play a crucial role in the Hippo Pathway’s global regulation of organ
homeostasis.

Early characterization of Hippo Pathway mutants uncovered a role for the pathway in regu-

lating mitotic progression, consistent with a role for yeast homologs in the mitotic exit/septa-
tion initiation networks. Hpo depletion in Drosophila S2 cells causes mitotic and central
spindle defects [31]. Similarly, mats mutant embryos show chromosome segregation defects
[32] and Mats over-expression has been shown to regulate cytokinesis [33], suggesting a role
for mats in mitotic exit in Drosophila. Importantly, mats mutant imaginal discs show increased

cyclin A (cycA) and cyclin B (cycB) levels [32] and wts mutant discs show increased cycA levels
[34]. The restriction of cycA is functionally important in restricting organ size downstream of
Wts [32]. Mutations in the mammalian tumor suppressor components of the pathway have
also been extensively characterized for their regulation of centrosomal dynamics [35–36],
mitotic exit/cytokinesis [37–39], and tetraploidy checkpoint [40]. Together, the data suggest
that Hippo Pathway components control appropriate mitotic cyclin levels in Drosophila cells
and also have more specific roles regulating the mitotic spindle and genome integrity. YAP and
TAZ have not been characterized as regulators of mitotic exit and cytokinesis, so it remains
unclear how the pathway regulates cyclin levels and mitotic progression. Understanding this
process will shed light on the complicated mechanism by which Hippo signaling coordinates
proliferation and organ homeostasis.

Here we identify Rae1 as an important and highly conserved regulator of proliferation and

organ size. Rae1 is a WD repeat protein first identified for a role in RNA export from the
nucleus in yeast [41] and now with reported roles in spindle assembly [42], regulation of the
Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APCC) [43–45], regulation of the E3 Highwire
[46], and spermatogenesis [47].

In this work, we present genetic and biochemical studies showing that Hippo signaling pro-

motes Rae1 degradation downstream of Wts/Lats, and parallel to the pathway’s regulation of
Yki/YAP. Importantly, Rae1 is epistatic to Wts in its regulation of cycB, and Hippo signaling
regulation of Rae1 is functionally relevant to its organ size functions. Instead of an “on/off”
switch for organ growth, our data implicates Rae1 as a molecular rheostat for organ size con-
trol. Complementing Yki/YAP’s role to transcriptionally regulate upstream Hippo Pathway
components, we also define a role for Rae1 to regulate the levels and activity of Hippo Pathway
components post-transcriptionally in a proposed feedback circuit to ensure Hippo Pathway
homeostasis.

Results
The Hippo Pathway promotes Rae1 degradation downstream of Wts/
Lats and parallel to Yki/YAP in vitro and in vivo
We identified Rae1 in a Drosophila in vitro expression cloning (DIVEC) screen [48–50] for in
vitro translated (IVT) proteins whose stability or migration on a gel was affected by supple-
menting IVT reticulocyte lysates with recombinant Mst1 and Mst2 proteins (S1A–S1C Fig,
[50], experimental detail is provided in the Materials and Methods section). To evaluate if Rae1
played a role in Hippo signaling, we first characterized Hippo signaling regulation of Rae1 sta-
bility in vitro in tissue culture cells and in vivo in Drosophila. In S2 cells, co-transfected Hippo
Pathway tumor suppressor components Mer, hpo, or wts each promoted a reduction in Rae1
levels (Fig 1A). Longer exposures showed a slower migrating band (Fig 1A) that decreased
when incubated with phosphatase (S2A Fig), and experiments in S2 extracts which preserve
proteasomal activity (see Materials and Methods for extract protocol) showed accumulation of
this band in the presence of MG132 and phosphatase inhibitors (Fig 1B), suggesting that
Hippo signaling promotes a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift and Rae1 degradation
by the proteasome. Consistent with this, reducing the gene dosage of hpo or wts in vivo in Dro-
sophila or impairing proteasome function by heterozygosity in E1 (Uba1, the most upstream
enzyme in the Ubiquitin Pathway), increased Rae1 protein levels as monitored by the levels of
a GFP-tagged Rae1 transgene, Rae1GFP [46] (Fig 1C and S2B–S2D Fig). RNAi knockdown of
hpo or wts stabilized co-transfected Rae1, and RNAi to wts prevented Hpo-induced degrada-
tion of Rae1 in S2 cells (Fig 1D and S2E Fig). Consistent with this, Rae1 protein levels were neg-
atively regulated by Hippo and Warts kinase activity in vivo in Drosophila imaginal discs and

reduction in Rae1-GFP protein compared to controls (lane 2). Hpo transgene expression did not affect GFP protein levels or salivary gland organ size. (F)

salivary glands (Fig 1E and 1F and S2F Fig). The ability of co-transfected wts to destabilize
Rae1 (Fig 1A) and of wts inhibition (through RNAi in vitro, Fig 1D and S2E Fig or over-expres-
sion of a kinase-dead transgene in vivo, Fig 1F) to stabilize Rae1 in the presence of over-
expressed Hpo indicates that Wts activity is required downstream of Hpo for regulating Rae1
protein levels in Drosophila cells and in tissues.

Importantly, regulation of Rae1 by Hippo signaling is highly conserved. Activating Hippo

signaling by over-expressing Mst1 and/or Lats1 promoted loss of co-transfected Rae1 in
immortalized HEK-293T cells (Fig 1G) and loss of endogenous Rae1 in tumorigenic U87-MG
(Fig 1H) or HeLa cells (S2G Fig). Rae1 loss was dose-responsive to Hippo signaling (S2H Fig)
and not due to cell death (S2I Fig).

To address if Rae1 is a direct target of the Warts/Lats kinase, we tested if immunoprecipi-
tated Rae1 was recognized by a phospho-RXXS antibody (the consensus Lats1 site [53]) (S3A
Fig). The percentage of immunoprecipitated Rae1 phosphorylated at the RXXS site increased
in a dose-responsive manner to increased pathway activation (S3A Fig). Like many WD repeat
proteins, recombinant Drosophila or human Rae1 purified from bacteria was insoluble and
refolding attempts resulted in largely aggregated protein unsuitable for direct kinase assays.
Therefore, we utilized small Rae1 peptides containing the putative Rae1 phosphorylation site
(S3B Fig). Despite recognition of endogenous Rae1 by the phospho-RXXS antibody, purified
system kinase assays using recombinant Lats2 and a Rae1 peptide of this site failed to show
phosphorylation even when showing robust phosphorylation of a control YAP peptide (S3B
Fig). Kinase assays with full-length baculovirus-produced Rae1 (a gift from Y. Ren and the Blo-
bel lab, [54]) showed insignificant phosphorylation by Lats2 compared to a positive control
(S3C Fig). Recognition by phosho-RXXS antibodies but failure of Lats2 to recognize Rae1 pep-
tides or baculovirus-expressed Rae1 may reflect that Warts/Lats kinase directly phosphorylates
full length Rae1 when in specific complexes with other proteins or requires a priming phos-
phorylation. Alternatively, the Warts-dependent Rae1 targeting observed (Fig 1 and S2 Fig)
may occur further downstream.

To exclude that changes in Rae1 are in part due to a transcriptional effect of Yki/YAP, we

conducted qRT-PCR of adult heads expressing a yki transgene (GMR>Yki, Fig 1I) and of
mammalian cells over-expressing activated YAP (YAPS127A and YAPS5A, Fig 1J). Both cases
showed increased levels of well-characterized transcriptional targets (expanded, a Yki target in
flies [26] and CTGF, a transcriptional target of YAP in mammalian systems [52]), confirming
increased Yki/YAP transcriptional activity, but did not show increased Rae1 transcripts.

Our in vitro extract experiments in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig 1B) showed accumu-

lation of a slower-migrating form of Rae1 from the initial time point to the 30 minute time
point; this does not rule out that Hippo signaling affected Rae1 via transcriptional means in
cells before extract creation but does suggest a means by which Hippo signaling regulates Rae1
post-translationally. If this occurred by a non-transcriptional role of Yki to regulate Rae1

protein levels, modulating the levels of Yki should modulate Rae1 levels. Reducing yki levels by
RNAi had no substantial effect on Rae1 protein levels or localization in S2 cells or in larval tis-
sues (Fig 1K and 1L and S3D–S3G Fig). Consistent with this, over-expressing activated YAP in
293T cells did not increase Rae1 protein levels (S3H Fig). These findings suggest that the
Hippo Pathway does not downregulate Rae1 levels through Yki/YAP via transcriptional or
post-translational mechanisms.

Rae1 loss decreases organ and organism size
To investigate if the negative regulation of Rae1 by the Hippo Pathway is functionally relevant
in restricting proliferation, organ size, and promoting apoptosis, we first characterized the phe-
notypes of reducing or over-expressing Rae1 in vivo in the fly. We used previously character-
ized Rae1 deletion allele Rae1ex28 [46] and four inducible RNAi lines corresponding to three
independent inverted repeat alleles: P{GD14705}v29303 from the VDRC referred to here as
Rae1IRV; 9862R-2 and 9862R-3 from the NIG collection, referred to here as Rae1IRN2 and
Rae1IRN3, and P{TRIP.HMS00670} from the Transgenic RNAi Project referred to here as
Rae1IRT. The inverted repeat in Rae1IRN2 and Rae1IRN3 is partially overlapping with Rae1IRV;
Rae1IRT is entirely non-overlapping with Rae1IRV, Rae1IRN2, and Rae1IRN3. To increase Rae1
gene dosage, we created inducible transgenic alleles Rae102 and Rae103, and used previously
characterized Rae1 transgenic allele Rae1GFP [46] (relative mRNA levels for a subset of these is
shown in S4A Fig).

Larvae homozygous for deletion of Rae1 or undergoing strong, constitutive Rae1 RNAi died
as small wandering third-instars (Fig 2A and 2B, [46]). Their imaginal discs were smaller than
control heterozygous animals. Reducing Rae1 levels by low level RNAi resulted in viable adults
of reduced weight and size (Fig 2C). Rae1 RNAi in the developing wing disc using nubgal4
resulted in adult flies with smaller wings (Fig 2D–2F). Similar phenotypes were observed using
different wing drivers and additional RNAi lines (S4B–S4J Fig) or by RNAi in a stripe in the
wing (S4K Fig). Rae1 RNAi in the proliferating cells of the developing eye disc using eygal4,
resulted in adult flies with smaller eyes (Fig 2G–2J, quantified in S2L Fig). Eyes containing pri-
marily homozygous Rae1ex28 mutant tissue were also small (Fig 2K and 2K’, quantified in S4M
Fig). Furthermore, organ size reduction was seen with non-overlapping RNAi lines, and Rae1
over-expression rescued RNAi phenotypes in the eye and wing (S4N–S4P Fig) indicating that
the reduced organ size phenotypes resulted specifically from Rae1 reduction and not off-target
effects. In contrast, Rae1 RNAi in differentiating eye cells (GMR>Rae1IRV) resulted in no obvi-
ous phenotype (Fig 1L and 1L’ and S4Q Fig).

Rae1 over-expression increases organ and organism size
The Rae1 loss-of-function phenotypes could result from an essential cell function or from a
normal role of Rae1 to promote organ size. If Rae1 positively regulates organ size, its over-
expression should increase organ size. Constitutive Rae1 over-expression increased overall
organism size in terms of weight and body length (Fig 2M and S4R Fig), increased wing size
(Fig 2O and 2P, quantified in 2Q), and increased eye size (S4S-S4S’ Fig). Over-expressing Rae1
in the whole wing or specific compartments also increased wing size (Fig 2N). Over-expressing
Rae1 in the proliferating cells (Fig 2R and 2R’) (but not the differentiating cells only, Fig 2S and
2S’, quantified in S4Q Fig) of the eye increased eye size. Despite larger overall size, Rae1 over-
expressing eyes appeared normally-patterned and showed no change in ELAV (a neuronal
marker) expression in third instar eye discs (S4T Fig). This is in stark contrast to Yki over-
expression in the early eye. Wild-type and constitutively active Yki expression in proliferating
cells of the eye with eygal4 or constitutively with Actgal4 resulted in loss of eye structures

(S4U-S4V’ Fig) reminiscent of ex loss [55–56] and as seen with Yki expression limited to the
dorsal-ventral margins with bigal4 [57]. As with loss of ex, the block in differentiation from Yki
over-expression with eygal4 in our study or bigal4 [57] was suppressed by loss of wingless (wg)
so likely resulted from effects of increased wg blocking progression of the Morphogenetic Fur-
row (MF). All together, the organ size phenotypes of Rae1 loss-of-function or over-expression
are consistent with a role for Rae1 to promote organ size and are consistent with Rae1 inhibi-
tion by the Hippo Pathway (Fig 1 and S2 Fig) to restrict organ size.

Rae1 modulation does not result in increased apoptosis or differentiation
effects
Effects on organ size can result from changes in cell size. Forward scatter of cells dissociated
from dissected mosaic wing discs containing clones of Rae1 RNAi using Rae1IRV and Rae1IRN2
showed no difference in size of cells undergoing RNAi to Rae1 (GFP-positive cells) compared
to control cells (GFP-negative cells) (S5A Fig). Similarly, forward scatter showed no difference
in size for Rae1 over-expressing cells (GFP-positive cells) compared to control cells (GFP-nega-
tive cells) (S5B Fig). This suggests that the smaller organ size of Rae1 RNAi and the larger
organ size of Rae1 over-expression did not result from changes in cell size.

Smaller organs could also result from increased cell death or from differentiation into other
structures. We saw no obvious increase in anti-activated caspase 3 staining or in TUNEL assays
upon Rae1 RNAi (S5C and S5D Fig for TUNEL). Moreover, co-expressing caspase inhibitor
p35 did not suppress the eye size phenotype of Rae1 RNAi (S5E Fig). Consistent with previous
studies that Rae1 RNAi in S2 cells did not promote apoptosis [58], these findings suggest that
decreased organ size did not result from increased apoptosis. We observed no effects on ELAV
staining upon Rae1 RNAi in actively dividing cells in the early eye (using eygal4) (S5F Fig) sug-
gesting that reducing Rae1 does not cause premature differentiation to reduce organ size.

Rae1 regulates proliferation
Smaller organs could result from decreased proliferation. In the Drosophila larval eye, a wave
of differentiation, the MF, passes from posterior to anterior. A subset of cells undergo an addi-
tional round of coordinated division called the Second Mitotic Wave (SMW) which appears as
a synchronized stripe of dividing cells just posterior to the MF. Cells posterior to the SMW in
the eye disc are not dividing at this stage and so do not normally stain for pHH3 and do not
undergo BrdU incorporation. When cells in this region are induced to undergo ectopic division
(for example, due to over-expression of an oncogene), individual cells will incorporate BrdU or

stain for cell cycle markers cycA, cycB, or pHH3 (appropriate for their cell cycle phase). If cells
enter S-phase but are endoreplicating or stall before mitosis (so are not actively cycling), they
do not stain for pHH3. When cells that have entered the cell cycle arrest in mitosis, cells in the
tissue do not incorporate BrdU but stain for pHH3. Effects of Rae1 on the cell cycle can thus be
assessed with cell cycle markers in the third instar larval eye.

Tissue undergoing Rae1 RNAi (GFP-positive) prior to differentiation showed reduced

BrdU incorporation most obviously in the SMW compared to adjacent wild-type tissue (GFP-
negative), consistent with decreased entry into S-phase (Fig 3A and 3A’ and S5G-S5H’ Fig).
This is consistent with a previously reported role for Rae1 in the G1-S transition in cell culture
[46]. Despite decreased BrdU incorporation, Rae1 RNAi clones in the eye disc did not show
decreased phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) staining (Figs 3B, 3B’, S5I and S5I’). Reduced BrdU
incorporation but no obvious reduction in pHH3 staining is perplexing but suggests that cells
undergoing Rae1 RNAi that do enter the cell cycle endure a prolonged stay or arrest in mitosis.

To further investigate this mitotic phenotype, in addition to constitutive Rae1 RNAi in

small clones, we examined eye discs undergoing Rae1 RNAi across all cells anterior to the MF
using eygal4. These discs were smaller than controls but, surprisingly, showed increased pHH3
staining in the antenna, anterior to the MF, and, strikingly, posterior to the MF compared to
controls (Fig 3C–3E; because the increased pHH3 staining made it difficult to distinguish the
posterior border of the SMW, pHH3 staining was quantified for the regions anterior to the MF
versus posterior to the MF including the SMW). Consistent with findings in the eye, we also
observed an increase in pHH3-positive cells in larval wing discs (Fig 3F and S5J–S5M Fig) and
in S2 cells (S5N Fig) upon Rae1 loss. As noted, cells posterior to the SMW do not divide during
the third instar larval stage and therefore should not stain positive for pHH3. We saw no signif-
icant BrdU incorporation or inappropriate cycA and cycB staining posterior to the SMW in
these discs (S5O–S5R Fig) indicating that (1) these pHH3-positive cells were not actively
cycling and (2) presumably they had completed cyclin degradation potentially placing them in
anaphase or telophase. Visual examination of nuclei in S2 cells undergoing Rae1 RNAi showed
significant abnormalities including multipolar spindles, inappropriately localized tubulin, and
lagging chromosomes (S6 Fig), consistent with reports that Rae1 depletion causes disorganized
or multipolar spindles as well as chromosome alignment and segregation defects in cultured
human and plant cells [42, 59–60] and in Drosophila neuroblasts and spermatocytes [47].

The requirement for Rae1 in cellular proliferation is conserved in mammalian cells; tran-
sient Rae1 knockdown in various mammalian transformed and tumorigenic cell lines repro-
ducibly restricted proliferation (Fig 3G–3I and S7A–S7D Fig). These cells have intact p53
signalling and did not show elevated p21 transcription (S7E–S7G Fig), suggesting the prolifer-
ative arrest is likely independent of p53.

A decrease in proliferation upon Rae1 loss might indicate a role for Rae1 to promote prolif-
eration. Over-expressing Rae1 in the early eye resulted in increased BrdU incorporation (Fig 3J
and S7H and S7I Fig) and increased pHH3 staining anterior to MF (Fig 3K and 3K’) suggesting
that Rae1 plays a role to promote proliferation. Analogously, Rae1 over-expression promoted
proliferation in both 293T and HeLa cells (Fig 3L and 3M). Taken together, these findings
reflect a highly conserved role for Rae1 in proliferation.

Rae1 regulates cyclin A and cyclin B levels
Previous studies reported genetic interactions between wts and cycA to regulate organ size [32],
and wts loss affected cycE, cycA, and cycB levels (S8A and S8B Fig). Although accumulation of
cycA and cycB has been reported in a variety of Hippo Pathway mutants, the functional mech-
anism underlying their regulation by Hippo signaling has remained unresolved. A prior report

linked decreased S-phase entry of Rae1 loss to cycE [58], and regulation of cycE by the Hippo
Pathway has already been established. Therefore, to further investigate the Rae1 loss-of-func-
tion mitotic phenotypes and establish if they underlie Hippo signaling regulation of mitosis, we
proceeded by examining cycA and cycB levels upon Rae1 knockdown. Clones undergoing
Rae1 RNAi anterior to the MF and in the SMW showed subtly decreased cycA and cycB stain-
ing compared to adjacent control tissue (Fig 4A–4D and S8C and S8C’ Fig). To establish if
decreased cyclin levels were functionally relevant to reduced organ size caused by Rae1 knock-
down, we reduced cycA and cycB gene dosage. Heterozygous mutation in cycA and cycB across
the fly each dominantly enhanced the reduced organ size phenotypes of Rae1 RNAi in the eye
and wing (Fig 4E–4H and S8D–S8G Fig) but did not reduce the size of control wings (S8H
Fig). Conversely, individually over-expressing cycE, cycA, or cycB3 partially suppressed
reduced eye size caused by reduction in Rae1 (S8I–S8M Fig) despite producing no overgrowth
of control eyes (S8N–S8R Fig).

The reduced cyclin levels upon reduction of Rae1 together with the genetic interaction stud-
ies suggest a normal role for Rae1 to positively regulate cycA and cycB levels to promote prolif-
eration and organ size. Consistent with this, cycA and cycB staining increased in Rae1-over-
expressing clones and discs (Fig 4I and 4I’ and S8S–S8U Fig). Furthermore, increasing Rae1 in
the larval wing disc increased cycB protein levels in a dose-dependent way (Fig 4J).

How does Rae1 regulate cycA and cycB? Rae1 was identified for a role in RNA export [41]
and was later reported to inhibit the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APCC) acti-
vator Cdh1/Fizzy-related (fzr, also called rap; referred to here as Cdh1/fzr) in mammalian cells
[43–45]. The APCC is a ubiquitin ligase that targets the mitotic cyclins and has an essential
role in mitosis. When coupled to substrate-specific activators Cdc20/Fizzy (fzy) and Cdh1/fzr,
the APCC ubiquitinates substrates to direct them for proteasomal degradation. Excess Cdh1/
Fzr activity upon Rae1 loss could explain reduction of cycA and cycB. To establish if Cdh1/Fzr
misregulation played a role in Rae1 organ size phenotypes, we tested interactions with APCC
components and regulators. We saw no obvious change in reduced organ size of Rae1 RNAi in
the eye by removing one copy of APCC subunit Cdc27 or Cdc20/fzy. However, removing one
copy of Cdh1/fzr across the fly dominantly suppressed the reduced organ size of Rae1 RNAi in
the eye and wing (Fig 4K–4L”) but did not increase the size of control organs (S8V Fig).
Although we cannot rule out parallel regulation of cycB by Cdh1/Fzr-APCC, these findings are
consistent with a model that the reduced organ size resulted from specific effects of Rae1 on
Cdh1/Fzr-APCC, not Cdc20-APCC.

Proliferation is necessary to achieve appropriate organ size, but changes in cell cycle regula-

tion are not sufficient to increase organ size. For example, loss of cell cycle regulators such as
cyclin E (cycE) can be dramatic enough that they cannot be compensated for sufficiently to
achieve normal organ size (S8X and S8Y Fig), but over-expression of cycE, cycA, or cycB3 on
their own do not increase organ size [32] (S8N–S8R Fig).

Hippo signaling regulation of Rae1 is important to its restriction of organ
size in vivo
Over-expressing Hpo, Sav and Wts, or Wts alone in differentiating cells of the Drosophila eye
reduces eye size. Eyes become smaller and rougher and black tissue appears with increased
expression of Hpo (S9A–S9D Fig); these phenotypes are suppressed by reducing wts gene dos-
age (S9E–S9G Fig). If these phenotypes result in part by promoting Rae1 degradation, they
would be enhanced by further reducing Rae1 and suppressed by restoring Rae1 levels. Remov-
ing one copy of Rae1 on its own (with Rae1ex28) or with a deficiency that uncovers it (Df(2R)
ED3923 or by Rae1 RNAi in differentiating eye cells (GMR>Rae1IRV) resulted in no obvious
phenotype (Fig 2L and 2L’) but enhanced the phenotype of over-expressing Hpo (GMR Hpo,
Fig 5A–5A’ and S9H–S9J’ Fig), Sav and Wts (GMR Sav, Wts, Fig 5B and 5B’ and S9K–S9K’
Fig), and Wts alone (GMR Wts, Fig 5C–5C’) in differentiating eye cells in terms of both eye
size and the appearance of black tissue. In contrast, co-over-expressing Rae1 in differentiating
eye cells (GMR>Rae102) or constitutively (Act>Rae1GFP) strongly suppressed the small eye
caused by GMR Hpo (Fig 5D and 5D’ and S9L and S9L’ Fig) but resulted in no obvious pheno-
type on its own (Fig 2S and 2S’). Similarly, the small wing phenotype caused by Hpo over-
expression in the wing was suppressed by reducing the gene dosage of wts or by Rae1 over-
expression (Fig 5E–5G and S9M–S9N Fig). These in vivo findings are consistent with tissue
culture findings that Hippo signaling negatively regulates Rae1 downstream of Wts (Fig 1 and
S2 Fig) and provide evidence that this regulation, regardless of direct targeting by Wts or tar-
geting further downstream, plays a role in the Hippo-mediated restriction of organ size.

Generally, RNAi reduces but does not eliminate gene expression; Rae1 RNAi should lead to
Rae1 protein at lower levels subject to its endogenous post-translational regulation. Therefore,
reducing the gene dosage of negative regulators of Rae1 protein should suppress Rae1 RNAi
organ size phenotypes. Indeed, mutations in Mer, ex, hpo, or wts dominantly restored eye and
wing size in organs undergoing Rae1 RNAi (S10A and S10B Fig and S1 Table for hpo, Mer, and
additional effectors on the eye, and S10C–S10E Fig for hpo and wts effects on the wing).
Together with our in vitro findings (Fig 1 and S2 Fig), these genetic interactions support a role
for Hippo signaling to negatively regulate Rae1 in vivo to restrict organ size.

Hippo Pathway downregulation of Rae1 (Fig 1 and S2 Fig), Rae1 inhibition of Cdh1/Fzr

[43–45], and Rae1 interaction with Cdh1/Fzr in vivo (Fig 4K–4L”) would further suggest that
Hpo promotes Cdh1/Fzr activation by relieving Cdh1/Fzr inhibition by Rae1. Therefore, Hpo
over-expression phenotypes may in part result from excess Cdh1/Fzr activity. Indeed, remov-
ing one copy of two distinct alleles of Cdh1/fzr partially restored GMR Hpo eye size (Fig 5H–
5H” for fzrG0326, S10F Fig) suggesting a possible functional link between the Hippo Pathway
and the essential cell cycle ubiquitin ligase, APCC.

Previous studies reported genetic interactions between wts and cycA to regulate organ size
[32]. We observed that wts loss affected cycE, cycA, and cycB levels (S8A and S8B Fig). If the

cyclin decreases in the context of Hippo signaling result from Rae1 depletion, then restoring
Rae1 levels should prevent Wts-mediated cyclin decrease. In the context of Wts over-expres-
sion, expressing a low level of Rae1 restored cycB protein to control levels in S2 cells (Fig 5I).

Accumulation of Rae1 is important for cycB accumulation and
overgrowth phenotypes seen upon Hippo Pathway loss of function
By the logic above, if accumulation of the cyclins in the absence of Hippo signaling resulted
from Rae1 accumulation, then reducing Rae1 levels in those contexts should suppress cyclin
accumulation phenotypes. As explained shortly, it is difficult to perform epistatic analysis with
double mutant tissue, so we were limited in the contexts in which to perform epistasis experi-
ments. Normal cyclin levels were restored in homozygous mutant wts or sav tissue in eye discs
(generated using MARCM tools) upon reducing Rae1 (by low level Rae1 RNAi or removing
one copy of Rae1) (Fig 6A and 6B). Together with the Wts-over-expression studies in Fig 5I,
these findings indicate that the Wts regulation of cycB occurs through the downregulation of
Rae1.

Knocking down Mer, ex, hpo, or wts in the posterior or whole wing or inhibiting Hippo sig-
naling with a kinase dead version of Hpo resulted in dramatic wing overgrowth (Fig 6D, 6G, 6J,
6M, 6O and 6R and S11C, S11G, S11N, S11R, S12A, S12C, S12E and S12H Figs) compared to
controls (Fig 6C, 6I and 6Q and S11A, S11E, S11L, S11P and S12G Figs). Reducing the levels of
critical target Yki suppresses this overgrowth ([26]; Fig 6S and S12F and S12J Fig). Similarly, in
contexts of little overgrowth, low-level Rae1 RNAi causing mild or no change in wing size on
its own or removing one copy of Rae1 significantly reduced overgrowth due to loss hpo or
over-expression of kinase dead Hpo (Fig 6E and 6H and S11D, S11I and S11J Fig). This sug-
gests that the accumulation of Rae1 upon loss of Hippo signaling (Fig 1C and 1D and S2B, S2D
and S2E Fig) is important for the resulting tissue overgrowth.

Tissue overgrowing due to loss of Mer, ex, hpo, or wts but not Yki-over-
expression requires Rae1 for tissue survival
Surprisingly, reducing Rae1 gene dosage in many of these overgrowth contexts also gave rise to
shriveled and blackened wings, a “tissue synthetic lethality” phenotype. As noted above, in con-
texts of little overgrowth, Rae1 knockdown suppressed overgrowth (Fig 6E, 6H and 6J and
S11D, S11I and S11J Fig) or led to blistering (S12B Fig). Upon much lower levels of Hippo
Pathway activity that causes more severe overgrowth, Rae1 knockdown caused catastrophic tis-
sue loss (Fig 6F, 6H”, 6K–6L, 6N, 6P, 6U and 6U”; S11H, S11I’ and S11J’ Fig). Enhanced over-
growth can cause tissue collapse; however, in these cases overall wing size decreased coincident
to tissue collapse, reflecting suppressed not enhanced overgrowth. This is also highlighted
when we reduce hpo, ex, or Mer in only the posterior compartment using engal4 (Fig 6K–6L,
6N and 6P and S12B and S12D Fig); anterior tissue remains intact indicating that the wings
inflated and only posterior tissue was collapsing. We saw tissue loss throughout the body

(ms1096>hpoIRT, Rae1ex28/+) suppresses the overgrowth (H). The gal4/UAS system is temperature responsive. Increasing
the temperature leads to increased expression of inverted repeats and increased knockdown of target genes. Increasing the
temperature to 27°C (H’) and 30°C (H”) further decreases Hippo signaling by increased RNAi to hpo. Blue overlaid tracings
show control ms1096>hpoIRT wing outlines from the indicated temperatures; wings are more overgrown but do not lie flat;
overlaid traced images of these wings are smaller than actual wing size. Removing one copy of Rae1 (which maintained the
Rae1 gene dosage to that in H) causes more dramatic tissue loss with further increasing the temperature to 27°C (H’) and
30°C (H”). (I) Control en>dcr wing at 18°C. (J) RNAi to hpo (en>dcr, hpoIRT) in the posterior wing at 18°C; wings are so

hpoIRT, Rae1IRV, K), or introducing Rae1ex28 (L) suppresses overgrowth and causes overgrowing wings to blacken and
shrivel (tracing of a control en>dcr, hpoIRT wing is overlaid to highlight growth suppression). (M-P) RNAi to Rae1 causes

were too overgrown to mount for comparison. (Q) Control wing (c5gal4/+). (R) RNAi to wts in the wing using c5gal4
(c5>wtsIRT) causes wing overgrowth (purple tracing in T, U, and V). (S) RNAi to yki (c5>wtsIRT, yikIRN, yellow tracing in T)
suppresses tissue overgrowth, restoring wing size to that of a control wing (black tracing). (U-V) In contrast to yki RNAi in
S-T, removing one copy of Rae1 using Rae1ex28 not only suppresses overgrowth but promotes significant tissue loss
(c5>wtsIRT, Rae1ex28/+, U, pink tracing in V). The resulting wings are significantly smaller than either control wings (Q) or
wings suppressed by yki RNAi (S); this is highlighted by an overlay of tracings in (V). Increasing the temperature to 27°C (U’)
and 30°C (U”) further decreases Hippo signaling by increased RNAi to wts. Blue overlaid tracings show control c5>wtsIRT
wing outlines from the indicated temperatures; as noted earlier, overgrowth in these context is quite dramatic such that
wings no longer lie flat; mounted wings thus wrongly appear smaller once they are flattened to be photographed. Under
these conditions, removing one copy of Rae1 (which maintained the Rae1 gene dosage to that in U) causes even more
dramatic loss of tissue.

including in the thorax, the legs, and the eye when we created random clones in proliferating
tissue (S12K Fig for the eye) and compelling growth suppression and tissue loss using multiple
gal4 drivers including nubgal4 (Fig 6C–6F), ms1096gal4 (Fig 6G–6H”‘), engal4 (Fig 6I–6P and
S12A–S12D Fig), and c765gal4 (referred to as c5gal4 Fig 6Q–6V). We did not observe cata-
strophic tissue loss when using GMRgal4, suggesting this phenomenon may reflect sensitivity
of proliferating, not differentiated, tissue. Importantly, this synthetic tissue lethality upon
reducing Rae1 in the context of limited Hippo Pathway activity is characteristically distinct
from Yki, reduction of which suppressed overgrowth upon loss of Hippo signaling but did not
compromise the survival of overgrowing tissue (Fig 6S and S12F and S12J Fig).

Tissue lethality instead of straight-forward suppression was unanticipated because (1) we

reduced Rae1 to a level with minimal or no phenotypes on its own (removing one copy or low-
level RNAi), (2) even significant knockdown or knockout of Rae1 does not cause tissue lethality,
and (3) Rae1 reduction would be expected only to decrease proliferation and decrease organ size.
When lethality results in genetic interactions upon modulating two genes each of whose individ-
ual modulation is not lethal, the term”synthetic lethality” is applied and usually results from per-
turbing genes with parallel, redundant roles or between genes of the same pathway. The “tissue
synthetic lethality” was specific for Hippo signaling and not a global response of overgrowing tis-
sue. We did not see tissue lethality upon Rae1 RNAi or removing one copy of Rae1 with expres-
sion of oncogenic Ras, myc, or caspase inhibitor p35 (S12L–S12O Fig for Myc and p35). The
“synthetic lethality” in this instance, therefore, might suggest that tissue with impaired Hippo sig-
naling requires Rae1 for survival and further supports a role for Rae1 in Hippo signaling.

To determine whether Rae1 could promote “synthetic lethality” of Yki-over-expressing tis-

matched or exceeded the extent of overgrowth seen for reducing Mer, ex, hpo, and wts. When
Yki caused moderate overgrowth matching those shown for loss of Mer, ex, hpo, or wts, Rae1
reduction in some cases suppressed the wing overgrowth but did not cause tissue ablation (Fig
7A–7D and S13A–S13R Fig). The lack of tissue collapse of Rae1 knockdown upon Yki over-
expression emphasizes that there is a fundamental difference between loss of Hippo signaling
and Yki over-activation and that the “tissue synthetic lethality” phenomenon is restricted to
specific components of the pathway including Mer, ex, hpo, and wts.

Rae1 regulates Yki/YAP levels, localization, and activity
In cases of Yki over-expression where there was even more dramatic overgrowth, Rae1 reduc-
tion did not suppress the overgrowth but unexpectedly enhanced Yki over-expression adult
phenotypes (S13D and S13S–S13T’ Fig). We used a moderately activated transgene (YkiS168A)
to determine whether the enhancement caused by Rae1 loss was more robust with a higher
threshold of Yki activity than that caused by wild-type Yki over-expression. Importantly, this
moderately activated form of Yki, YkiS168A, is still responsive to Hippo Pathway regulation
since co-expression of Hpo and Wts reduces the size of YkiS168A clones and suppresses Yki-
mediated eye overgrowth [61]. Because this transgene causes adult lethality with promoters
that drive expression in proliferative tissues, we analyzed interactions between Rae1 and
YkiS168A in carefully-staged larval organs. Removing a genomic copy of Rae1 dramatically
enhanced the Yki-mediated overgrowth phenotypes in imaginal discs (shown for wing and eye
discs in Fig 7E–7G and 7I–7K but also seen in leg imaginal discs). Rae1 knockdown using
RNAi further enhanced these phenotypes (Fig 7H and 7L). In the salivary glands, YkiS168A mis-
expression restricted salivary gland size (Fig 7M and 7N as reported previously, [62]) which
was enhanced with Rae1 loss (Fig 7O and 7P).

In addition to their changes in size, these tissues showed stronger YkiS168A fluorescence

upon Rae1 reduction (for example, the disc in Fig 7H compared to 7F), suggesting that Rae1 may
negatively affect Yki protein levels. Rae1 reduction reproducibly increased the levels of both V5
and FLAG-tagged wild-type Yki in wing disc lysates (Fig 8A and 8B). In salivary glands, mis-
expressed Yki migrated as a doublet, presumably because of phosphorylation mediated by Hippo
Pathway activity (reported to be high in the salivary glands [62]). Rae1 loss caused an increase in
Yki levels and reduced the proportion of the slower-migrating form (Fig 8 and S13U Fig). Effects
on Yki were conserved in mammalian cells; HeLa cells knocked down for Rae1 showed increased
YAP levels compared to control-treated cells (Fig 8C). Consistent with studies of Yki localization
in the wing [28], immunofluorescence of Yki mis-expressing salivary glands showed that both
wild-type and YkiS168A are predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig 8D–8D” for YkiS168A). Rae1 loss pro-
moted nuclear localization of YkiS168A (Fig 8E–8E”). This restriction of Yki localization is con-
served in mammalian cells; Rae1 knockdown promoted accumulation and nuclear localization of
YAP in transformed, non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (Fig 8G–8G”) compared to con-
trol cells (Fig 8F–8F”). Furthermore, this YAP accumulation and relocalization promotes YAP
transcriptional activity (Fig 8H). The increase in Yki/YAP protein levels upon loss of Rae1 sug-
gests that Rae1 plays a role to limit Yki/YAP levels. Consistent with this, Rae1 over-expression
reduced mis-expressed Yki protein levels (Fig 8I).

Rae1 feeds back to regulate upstream Hippo Pathway components Mer,
Hpo, and Wts
Given that a genome-wide mass-spec study reported direct binding between Rae1 and Yki
[63], we cannot exclude that some effects of Rae1 on Yki/YAP might be mediated by direct
interactions. However, in experiments exploring the role of Rae1 in Wts-mediated cyclin

regulation, we had observed that increased Rae1 levels stabilized myc-Wts (Fig 5I). Because
post-translational effects on Yki/YAP levels, localization, and activity are known to result from
targeting by the Hippo Pathway [26–28, 61], the Rae1 effects on Wts protein in Fig 5I could
explain the regulation of Yki/YAP. This raises the possibility that in addition to serving as a tar-
get of the pathway, Rae1 could act in a feedback circuit to promote Hippo Pathway activity at a
step upstream of Yki/YAP.

To investigate the potential for Rae1 to regulate upstream components, we examined their
levels and activity in vitro and in vivo. Rae1 over-expression increased Wts protein levels in S2
cells and Drosophila tissue (Fig 9A and 9B and Fig 5I). Conversely, Rae1 loss reduced Wts pro-
tein levels in Drosophila tissue (Fig 9C) and reduced Lats1 activation in mammalian cells (Fig
9D), indicating that Rae1 regulation of Wts/Lats is conserved. Rae1 over-expression increased
Hpo and Mer protein levels in S2 cells and Hpo activation in Drosophila tissue (Fig 9E–9G),
suggesting that Rae1 might act at or upstream of Mer, or on multiple components when in
complex together. Because Rae1 did not promote accumulation of other proteins tested includ-
ing GFP (Fig 1E) and promoted reduction in Yorkie/YAP levels (Fig 8I), effects on Mer, Hpo,
and Wts protein levels are unlikely due to a non-specific effect to stabilize all proteins.

Activation of Hippo signaling requires proper recruitment of the Hpo and Wts kinases to

specific regions in the apical membrane from distinct domains by upstream components of the
pathway [64–65]. Mer and Ex are membrane-associated proteins that facilitate this activation
of Hippo signaling by recruiting Wts/Lats to the membrane where it receives its activating
phosphorylation from Hippo/MST [64–65]. To assess how Rae1, a primarily nuclear protein,
could affect the protein levels and activation of these components, we looked more closely at
Rae1 localization. Consistent with previous reports about Rae1 localization in other systems
[42, 59–60, 66], a Rae1-GFP fusion protein was strongly enriched in the nucleus and nuclear
periphery in various Drosophila tissues (Fig 9H and S14A–S14A” Fig). Rae1 was also found to
be associated with a mesh-like network in the cytoplasm. Importantly, at higher levels of Rae1
(resulting from reduced Hpo or Uba1 or from increased Rae1 expression) a pool of Rae1 local-
ized to the membrane (Fig 9I and 9J and S14C–S14C” Fig) whereas at lower levels of Rae1
(such as upon co-expression of Hpo, S14B–S14B” Fig and S14D–S14D” Fig), this pool disap-
peared. Curiously, in addition to promoting accumulation of Wts protein levels (Figs 5I and
9A and 9B) over-expressing Rae1 increased the membrane association of Wts protein, includ-
ing some areas of co-localization (Fig 9L and 9L’ compared to Fig 9K and 9K’). Increased Wts
at the membrane could reflect the increase in overall Wts levels (Figs 5I and 9A and 9B).
Because Mer acts to increase Wts recruitment to the membrane, increased Wts at the mem-
brane could also reflect the increased Mer levels (Fig 9G). Mer and Rae1 both bind microtu-
bules in purified systems [42, 67]. Mer’s association with microtubules is increased upon
microtubule acetylation, and interaction with acetylated microtubules is critical in regulating
YAP [67–69]. Therefore another potential explanation for the increased Wts recruitment to
the membrane could be via Rae1 effects on microtubules or microtubule acetylation which
could affect Mer. Rae1 over-expression in Drosophila tissues dramatically increased the pro-
portion of acetylated tubulin while tissue undergoing Rae1 RNAi showed reduced acetylated
tubulin (Fig 9M and 9N). All together, these findings would be consistent with higher levels of
Rae1 activating the Hippo Pathway at the membrane my mutiple mechanisms: (1) Rae1 could
act at an upstream step to promote tubulin acetylation to regulate Mer, and/or (2) Rae1 could
promote accumulation of core components Mer, Hpo, and Wts which would then promote
downregulation of both Rae1 and Yki/YAP (Fig 10).

Discussion
The Hippo Pathway promotes Rae1 degradation
The Hippo Tumor Suppressor Pathway plays a highly conserved role from Drosophila to mam-
mals in organ homeostasis, in restricting growth and proliferation, and in promoting apoptosis.
By searching for post-translational targets, we identified Rae1 as a novel target of Hippo signal-
ing downstream of Wts with a role to regulate proliferation, cycB, and organ size. Our studies
showed that Rae1 is regulated by Wts in vitro and Wts kinase activity in vivo. Whether Rae1 is
a direct target of Wts remains an open question. Rae1 binds both Wts and Lats in Drosophila
and mammalian cultured cells and increasing Hippo activity shows increased recognition of
Rae1 by a pRXXS antibody. However, an in vitro kinase assay using a peptide encompassing
the Wts consensus motif and full-length purified Rae1 showed no phosphorylation. These data
raise the possibilities that Rae1 phosphorylation by Wts would require an additional co-factor
or a priming phosphorylation, or that Rae1 is targeted downstream of Wts by another kinase.
Ongoing studies are centered on resolving how the Hippo Pathway targets Rae1 for
degradation.

Unlike DIAP1, which is regulated both transcriptionally by Yki [26] and post-translationally
by phosphorylation by the pathway [19, 21], we found no evidence that Rae1 transcript or pro-
tein levels are regulated by Yki in Drosophila tissues. This is consistent with previous RNA-seq
and microarray studies that showed no major changes in Rae1 mRNA in Yki over-expressing
or wts mutant contexts [75–77]. Our studies in mammalian cell lines also show no evidence for
Rae1 transcriptional regulation by YAP activity. Consistent with this, microarray studies of
activated YAP [9, 52, 78–81] as well as ChIP-on-chip, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies [52, 81–
83] did not show statistically significant regulation of Rae1 mRNA in a variety of mouse tissues
and human cell lines. Rae1 regulation thus may represent another example of Yki-independent
functions of the Hippo pathway including a variety of developmental processes such as den-
dritic tiling [84], planar polarity [85], salivary gland and neuronal autophagy [62, 86] as well as
in growth control contexts including that elicited by F-actin accumulation [87] and alcohol
[88], the mechanisms of which remain unresolved. Recent work also identified novel Yki-inde-
pendent pathway effectors such as Enabled, Mud, and Canoe in processes such as collective
migration [89], and spindle orientation [90–91].

Rae1 regulates cyclin B downstream of Wts
Phenotypic characterization revealed that Rae1 acts as a regulator of organ and organism size
and as a critical regulator of mitosis. While both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies

targets DIAP1, Yki, and Rae1. Due to the complexity of the Hippo signaling network, not all upstream regulators,
downstream targets, or crosstalk with other pathways are pictured. (A) When the Hippo Pathway is active (“ON”),
DIAP1 is down-regulated transcriptionally due to Yki inactivation [26] and post-translationally by direct phosphorylation
by the core cassette [19, 21]. Inactivation of Yki restricts cell growth (for example, due to decreased bantam (ban)

transcription [70] and myc transcription [71–72], not pictured) and impairs S-phase entry by decreasing cyclin E
transcription [26]. Down-regulation of Rae1 impairs S-phase entry (Fig 3A) and mitotic progression in part by promoting
cycA and cycB loss (Fig 4). (B) When the Hippo Pathway is inactive (“OFF”), Yki promotes increased ban [70] and myc
[71–72] (not pictured) and DIAP1 [26] transcription to promote growth and survival. DIAP1 levels increase further to
promote cell death resistance due to the absence of de-stabilizing phosphorylation [19, 21]. Rae1 accumulates due to
absence of Wts-mediated downregulation (Fig 1 and S2 Fig) and together with the Yki-dependent increased cyclin E
promotes S-phase entry. Rae1 promotes accumulation of cycA and cycB to promote proliferation (Figs 3 and 4). (C)
When Hippo signaling is lost but Rae1 levels are not sufficient to meet the demands of the overgrowing tissue (“OFF
Rae1 loss”), the subsequent imbalance causes catastrophic tissue loss (Fig 6). (D) We propose a possible model of a
Rae1 feedback circuit to explain Rae1 regulation of Yki activity. Upstream components Mer and Ex promote activation
of the core kinase cassette [29]. The core cassette then inhibits Yki and Rae1. Ex also plays a role to inhibit Yki by direct
binding (not pictured) [73–74]. When active, Yki promotes transcription of mer and ex to promote pathway feedback.
Dotted lines in this simplified, conceptual model represent possible interactions between the Hippo signaling
components tested in Fig 9 as candidate targets of feedback from Rae1. Our data (Fig 9) clearly shows a role for Rae1
to regulate Mer, Hpo, and Wts levels and to promote tubulin acetylation either or both of which may explain the Rae1
interactions with Yki (Figs 7 and 8). We cannot rule out a role for Rae1 to inhibit Yki directly (dashed line).

showed increased mitotic index, cells in the former context were not actively cycling and each
context produced distinct outcomes in terms of cyclin levels suggesting that Rae1 normally acts
to promote mitotic progression and its loss results in a prolonged stay or arrest in mitosis. Con-
sistent with our findings, synchronization experiments in BY-2 plant cells showed that Rae1
depleted cells entered mitosis normally but showed delayed progression [59]. This mitotic phe-
notype may result from mitotic cyclin dysregulation. We observed that the mitotic cells knocked
down for Rae1 did not stain for cycA and cycB, consistent with arrest in anaphase or telophase.
Rae1 loss of function results in decreased cycA and cycB levels, while Rae1 over-expression

promotes high cycA and cycB protein levels. Our genetic interaction studies show that the
restriction of cycA and cycB levels is critical for Rae1 loss-of-function reduced organ size phe-
notypes. Furthermore, Rae1 acts epistatically to wts and sav loss of function in regulating cyclin
protein levels. In this work we thus established a Hippo Pathway-dependent but Yki-indepen-
dent role for Rae1 in mitotic cyclin regulation. A summary of the similarities and differences
between the roles and phenotypes of Rae1 and Yki is shown in S2 Table. How could Rae1 regu-
late the mitotic cyclins? Rae1 has been reported to regulate APCC activator Cdh1/fzr [43–45].
Indeed, we showed that Cdh1/fzr genetically interacts with both Rae1 and Hippo to regulate
organ size. Not necessarily mutually exclusive, Rae1 is an RNA binding protein and may
directly regulate cycB transcripts, suggested by studies in plants and yeast [62, 92]. Thirdly,
mass spec screens in yeast identified binding between Rae1 homolog Gle2 and B-type cyclins
CLB2 and CLB3 [93] so may affect cycB by direct protein-protein interaction.

As noted, “organ size checkpoint” mechanisms normally compensate for changes in prolif-
eration to ensure that final organ size is not altered. Rae1 over-expression increased both pro-
liferation and organ size suggesting an exciting role for Rae1 in the Hippo signaling network to
integrate regulation of proliferation and overall organ size. We propose that Rae1 acts as a
“rheostat” for organ size rather than an “on/off” switch for tissue growth: decreasing Rae1 lev-
els tunes the dial down to a lower organ size while increasing Rae levels tunes the dial up to a
larger organ size. However, increased cyclin levels are insufficient to increase organ size. It will
be interesting for future studies to investigate which Rae1-dependent processes mediate
increased organ size.

A Rae1-Hippo Pathway feedback circuit
Our studies show that Rae1 restricts Yki levels and localization in Drosophila tissues and YAP
localization, levels, and activity in mammalian cells, potentially as a result of Rae1-mediated
functional regulation of upstream components of the Hippo Pathway. Increasing Rae1 levels

leads to Rae1 deposition outside the nucleus including at the plasma membrane where activa-
tion of the pathway occurs. Rae1 is a conserved regulator of actin and microtubule networks in
vitro [41–42, 66], and we showed that Rae1 promotes microtubule acetylation in vivo. Rae1
effects on microtubules could reflect a role in mitosis and spindle assembly [41–45, 47, 59–60,
66]. Alternatively, tubulin acetylation is implicated in activation of Hippo signaling in some
contexts [94]. Mer interacts with acetylated microtubules; mutants disrupting this association
promote YAP nuclear localization [67–69, 94]. Mer is crucial in recruiting Wts to the mem-
brane to signal [64–65]. Collectively, these observations are consistent with a model that Rae1
could regulate tubulin acetylation and/or stability to correctly localize Mer to allow for Wts
recruitment for proper Hippo signaling (Fig 10).

We observed that Rae1 increases the protein levels of Mer, Hpo and Wts. Rae1 regulation of
Wts is conserved; Rae1 loss reduces Wts levels in Drosophila tissues and reduces pLats levels in
mammalian cells, and other reports indicate Rae1 interactions with Mst2 in HEK-293T cells
[95]. Previous reports showed that upstream component Fat promotes accumulation of Wts
protein in Drosophila [96–97]. Future work will address if stabilization of Hpo and Wts
occurred via upstream stabilization of Mer, akin to Fat regulation of Wts protein levels. Previ-
ous work addressing the instability of Sav protein showed Hpo/Mst association with Sav is sta-
bilizing in both flies and mammalian systems [98–99]. Our observations are consistent with an
alternate but not mutually exclusive model that Rae1 could promote stabilization of a complex
of core pathway components by promoting their assembly following proper recruitment of
Wts to the membrane or by direct association.

A possible role for Rae1 in cancer and cancer therapeutics
Disrupting the tight link between proliferation and organ size can have serious consequences
in normal development and in diseases such as cancer. Hippo Pathway dysregulation is associ-
ated with a broad spectrum of cancers, and mutations in upstream component Merlin are asso-
ciated with the familial tumor syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) [2–19]. Our
findings in both Drosophila and mammalian cells demonstrate that (1) high levels of Rae1 pro-
mote proliferation, (2) that Rae1 levels are controlled by Hippo signaling, and (3) that this
increased proliferation due to high levels of Rae1 allows cells to evade the organ size check-
point. We showed that Rae1 over-expression could promote proliferation of human cancer
cells in culture, and our data suggests that Rae1 protein may accumulate upon loss of Hippo
signaling in cancer cells. TCGA data indicates Rae1 amplification in a range of cancers [100–
101] and Rae1 protein levels accumulate in gliomas [102], a tumor type where loss of Mer and
Hippo Pathway function are frequently implicated [11].

Importantly, we showed that decreasing Rae1 dramatically compromised the survival of tis-
sue with abrogated Hippo signaling. This means that maintaining sufficient Rae1 was crucial in
the context of Hippo Pathway loss; when Rae1 levels did not reach a critical threshold, the tis-
sue underwent massive catastrophe. Elucidating this phenomenon could have tremendous
impact for cancer therapeutics. In recent years, evidence has emerged that cancer cells rely
heavily on individual genes for survival (oncogene and non-oncogene “addiction”) [103–106]
It has also been proposed that “second site mutations” that do not impair viability of wild-type
tissue can disadvantage cancer cells with specific primary lesions, and that this “synthetic
lethality” can be exploited therapeutically [107]. Given the role of Rae1 to promote cell prolifer-
ation and increase organ size, its conserved regulation by the Hippo pathway in both cultured
insect and mammalian cells, and the synthetic tissue lethality phenomenon observed in Hippo-
compromised tissue, we propose that Rae1 may represent a novel therapeutic target in cancers
arising due to loss of Hippo Pathway tumor suppression (Fig 10).

Materials and Methods
Drosophila
Flies were raised on standard media at 25°C unless otherwise stated. Genotypes are detailed are
detailed separately for larval and adult tissues appearing in image panels and tissue analyzed in
Western blots. The coding region of Rae1 was cloned into pUAST. Genetic Services, Inc. per-
formed vector injection of pUAST-Rae1 and isolated independent transgenic lines.

Adult wings of progeny were photographed, all at the same magnification. For quantitation,
between 4 and 20 wings per genotype were traced using Adobe Photoshop CS5 or ImageJ, and
wing areas were normalized to the average area in control. For engal4 wings, we measured area
posterior to vein L4. For c5gal4, total wing area is shown. Because of the effect on eye shape
and size with both Hippo and Yki over-expression and Rae1 loss of function phenotypes, we
found side-by-sides the best way to represent genetic interactions with Rae1 with respect to eye
size. To rule out unintentional observer bias, experiments were scored blind with lab members
evaluating eyes without knowledge of genotypes. We also indicate quantification of eye outlines
traced and measured using Image J. The data shown in the figures are representative experi-
ments that have been performed independently at least 3 times.

tured cell extracts were visualized with the Li-Cor Odyssey. Westerns of Drosophila tissue
extracts were developed using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad). Results from immu-
nohistochemical staining and Western Analysis were reproduced in at least three independent
trials.

Tissue culture
S2 cells cultured at 25°C were transfected with Actin-Gal4, pIE1-4-myc-Hippo, pIE1-4-myc-
Warts, pIE1-4-HA-Merlin and UAS-FLAG-His6-

Rae1, pAc5.1-His6-FLAGx3-Rae1, pAc5.1-Rae1-V5-His using Cellfectin II (Invitrogen) or

Effectene (Qiagen). HEK-293T, U87MG and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen)
containing 10% FBS (Gemini) and 50 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini). Transfection
with pCMV5-FLAG-Mst1, pCMV2-FLAG2 Lats1, pCMV-FLAG Yap2 S127A, pCMV-FLA-
G-Yap2 5SA, using Effectene (Qiagen) was performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Mitotic index determination in S2 cells
The percentage of anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (Cell Signalling Technology)-positive S2
cells per total cells (mitotic index) was determined by scoring a total of at least 400 cells in each
of four independent experiments.

Drosophila in vitro Expression Cloning (DIVEC) screening
Bacterial stocks containing plasmids of Drosophila Gene Collection Releases 1 and 2 (repre-
senting more than 11,000 genes in the Drosophila genome) were grown as individual 1 ml cul-
tures then pooled for isolation of plasmid DNA in pools of 12 and 16. Pools containing 12–16
plasmids were in vitro translated (IVT) using the Promega TNT combined in vitro transcrip-
tion/translation kits and labeled with 35S-methione. Pool IVTs were incubated in the presence
or absence of two unrelated kinases or a combination of recombinant Mst1 and Mst2 (Invitro-
gen) and run on a gel (Drosophila In vitro Expression Cloning) [48–50]. Bands representing
individual clones in the pools were considered positive hits if showing a gel shift, smear, or
other change after incubation with Hpo compared to the control incubation or incubation with
two unrelated kinases.

Cell lysis
S2 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 g for 3 minutes. The cell pellet was washed
once and resuspended in either 8M urea, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 1% NP40 and 1 mM
EDTA or in 8M urea dissolved in PhosphoSafe Extraction Reagent (Novagen). In both cases,
the lysis buffers were supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).

Extract protocol
S2 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended
in 300 μL of extract buffer (20 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 250 mM sucrose, 100 μg/mL cycloheximide, 1 mM PMSF,
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mM NaF, 20 mM NaOPO7, 40 mM b-glycerophosphate
and para-Nitrophenylphosphate, supplemented with either 20 μM MG132 or DMSO) and
homogenized using 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Cell extracts were incubated at room
temperature and stopped by the addition of 6x Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 10
minutes

CIP treatment
100 μg of protein was incubated with 200 units of calf-intestinal phosphatase (New England
Biolabs) with NEB Buffer 3 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM
PMSF at room temperature for 10 minutes. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6x
Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 10 minutes.

RNAi
The DNA template was generated using the following primer sets (Table 1):

dsRNA was generated using the T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System

(Promega), followed by DNAse digestion using RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse (Promega). 1x106
cells were treated with 15 μg dsRNA for 48–72 hours and then transfected with appropriate
plasmids (Fig 4C and 4M) or co-transfected with plasmids and dsRNA (S8F Fig).

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
RNA from approximately 15 larvae of each genotype or 30 adult heads was extracted using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For mammalian cells, RNA was extracted using the GeneJet
RNA Purification kit (Thermo). In all cases, RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase
(Promega). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad)
and diluted 1:50 for each quantitative PCR reaction (QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix (Fisher
Scientific)).

The probes used were (Table 2):

Statistics and reproducibility
Statistical analysis was performed using Excel. For all quantitative changes, T-test (with one-sided
using equivalent variance) were conducted. For changes in categorical data (for example, incidence
of black tissue or pHH3 cells), chi tests were conducted. All data presented represent typical find-
ings from experiments performed a minimum of three times with appropriate controls.

FACS
Approximately 20 third instar larval wing discs of each genotype were dissected in PBS and
transferred to 0.5 mL of 10x Trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 3
hours at room temperature on a nutator. The cells were analyzed using FACScalibur and BD
CellQuest Pro.

Cell counts
24 hours after transfection, 2.5x104 (for 293T, Rae1 over-expression) and 3.5x104 (for HeLa,
Rae1 over-expression) cells were added to each well of multiple12-well cell culture dishes. For
the Rae1 knockdown experiment, 1.0x105 cells (for 293T, Rae1 knockdown) were added to
each well of multiple 6-well cell culture dishes.

Cells were incubated at 37°C until harvest. At approximately 24, 48, and 72 hours post-seeding,
one dish was retrieved from incubation and the contents of each well were aspirated. Each well was
washed twice in 1x PBS. The adherent cells were dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA and subse-
quently counted using a Coulter Counter (Beckman) or using Cell Countess (Invitrogen).

BrdU incorporation
Third instar larval eye discs were dissected in serum-free Schneider’s media and then incubated
with 8 μg/mL BrdU for 30 minutes at room temperature. Discs were washed first in serum-free

media then in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in PBS) for 30 minutes. They
were permeabilized in PBS/0.1%Triton 100 (PBT) and incubated in 2N HCl solution (diluted
in PBT) for 30 minutes. Cells were washed in PBT and incubated overnight in anti-BrdU
(1:500, BD Biosciences) and standard protocols were followed for secondary staining. BrdU
incorporation was imaged on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 and AxioVision Release 4.8 and/or also
on a Leica TSC-SP confocal.

Direct kinase assays
Rae1 and YAP Peptides were synthesized by Genscript and incubated individually with com-
mercially available Lats2 (Invitrogen), spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose cation exchange
paper (Whatman). The P81 paper was washed at least five times in 0.5% orthophosphoric acid
until counts were no longer detectable in the washes, rinsed with ethanol, and air-dried. The
dried P81 papers were mixed with Ready Safe scintillation mix (Beckman) and counted in a
Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Purified Rae1 (a kind gift from Y Ren and the Blobel lab)
or MBP (Sigma) were diluted in kinase assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH8, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
DTT) incubated in the presence of 100 μM cold ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant
Lats2 (Invitrogen). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 minutes at 30°C, terminated
with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Supporting Information
S1 Fig. Rae1 was a strong hit from the DIVEC screen. (A) Schematic summarizing the
DIVEC screen to identify novel substrates of the Hippo and Warts kinases. The Drosophila
Gene Collection releases 1 and 2 were combined into pools of 12–16 clones. Pools were in vitro
translated (IVT), labeling all clones with 35S methionine. Pool IVTs were incubated with two
unrelated kinases or with recombinant Hippo (Mst1 and Mst2 recombinant protein purchased
), smearing, or alteration/loss
from Invitrogen). Positive hits were those which showed a shift (
of full length signal compared to the load lane in the presence of Hippo but not the unrelated
kinases. Addition of Hippo protein activates the pathway to regulate downstream targets in the
reticulocyte lysate [19], so the screen is designed to identify downstream targets of the core cas-
sette, possibly both Hippo and Warts/Lats substrates. (B) Gel from DIVEC screen showing
Rae1 (arrow) as a positive hit in the pool. Almost all of Rae1 shifted to a slower migrating form

) in the presence of added Hippo (right-most lane, asterisk), but does not shift in control lane
(
(left-most lane, arrow), or in the presence of two unrelated kinases (middle lanes). We there-
fore classified Rae1 as a strong hit targeted directly by recombinant Mst1/2, by activated reticu-
locyte Lats1/2, or by another enzyme in the reticulocyte lysate activated by Mst1/2 and/or
Lats1/2. An advantage of this screening approach is that it allowed us to identify both direct
kinase targets and targets further downstream that are modified by enzymes in the lysate in an
Mst/Lats-dependent manner. (C) A pool showing no positive hits. All bands show similar
migration and levels in the Hippo lane (right-most lane) as in the load control lane (left-most
lane).

lane 3), compared to control (+/+, lane 1) in Drosophila salivary glands. (C) Rae1-GFP protein
levels are increased when the ubiquitin pathway is impaired at the level of the Ubiquitin Activat-
ing Enzyme E1. Reducing the gene dosage of E1 (reduced by introducing one copy of the Uba1B1
allele, lane 3) increases Rae1 levels compared to control (+/+, lane 2) in Drosophila salivary glands.
(D) Rae1-GFP protein levels are sensitive to the gene dosage of hpo (reduced by introducing one
copy of the hpoMGH1 allele, lane 2) and ubiqiuitin pathway impairment (reduced by introducing
one copy of the Uba1B1 allele, lane 3) compared to control (+/+, lane 2) in Drosophila salivary
glands. (E) Co-transfecting S2 cells with a c-terminally tagged Rae1 and hpo (lane 2) causes loss of
Rae1 protein levels compared to control-transfected cells (lane 1). RNAi to hpo (lane 3) or wts
(lane 4) stabilizes Rae1 in the presence of co-transfected hpo compared to cells treated with con-
trol RNAi (second lane). (F) Over-expressing a wild-type (lane 2) but not a kinase-dead (lane 3)
Hpo transgene in the context of Rae1-GFP over-expression in salivary glands shows a reduction
in Rae1-GFP protein compared to controls (lane 1). (G) Over-expression of both Mst1 and Lats1
in HeLa cells showed loss of endogenous Rae1 protein levels compared to control-transfected
cells. (H) Transfection of increasing Mst1 levels showed a dose-dependent loss of endogenous
Rae1. (I) HEK293T cells expressing human myc-Rae1 were co-transfected with Mst1 showing a
dose-dependent decrease in Rae1 protein levels (lanes 1–3). Concomitant over-expression of
baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35 to block apoptosis did not block Rae1 reduction in the
Mst1-over-expressing cells (lanes 4–5). In B-I, relative levels of Rae1 (normalized by GFP in blot
C, and Tubulin in all other blots) and Mst1 in H (normalized by Tubulin) are indicated.

S3 Fig. Investigating Rae1 regulation by Warts/Lats and Yki/YAP. (A) The region surround-
ing the Lats1 consensus site (red box) in Rae1 is strongly conserved across species. Cells co-
transfected with Mst1 and/or Lats1 and myc-Rae1 showed decreased Myc-Rae1 levels in the
whole cell lysate (WCL) and also immunoprecipitated Rae1 (Myc-IP) as expected. Immuno-
precipitated Rae1 was recognized by an anti-phospho-RXXS antibody (Lats1 consensus site),
and the percentage of Rae1 phosphorylated at the Lats consensus motif increased with
increased pathway activation. Relative levels of phosphorylated Rae1 are indicated. Quantifica-
tion of anti-phospho-RXXS antibody (Lats1 consensus site) recognition of Myc-Rae1 immuno-
precipitated from whole cell lysates of cells co-transfected with Mst1 and/or Lats1 are indicated
as relative levels below the blot and in the graph below (normalized to the amount of immuno-
precipitated total Rae1). (B) Peptides were generated using 11 amino acids (underlined in black
in A) for Drosophila Rae1 (dmRae1) and human Rae1 (hsRae1) with alanine mutants that abol-
ished the Wts consensus site (RXXA) Similar control and alanine mutant peptides were gener-
ated for YAP (hsYAP). A peptide kinase assay using Lats2 showed robust phosphorylation of
wild-type YAP peptide but not of the S127A mutant peptide or of any of the Rae1 (wild-type or
alanine mutant) peptides. (C) Kinase assays using Lats2, Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), and full
length, purified baculovirus Rae1 [54] (a gift from Y. Ren and the Blobel lab). Coomassie gel
shows levels of MBP and Rae1 protein used, and phosphorimage shows no significant phos-
phorylation of Rae1 in the presence of Lats2 compared to the MBP positive control. (D-F) Co-
transfecting S2 cells with yki RNAi causes no change in Rae1 localization (E) compared to con-
trol-transfected cells (D). Rae1 RNAi causes a reduction of the membrane-bound pool of FLA-
G-Rae1 (F). Scale bars in D-F indicate 5 μm. (G) Rae1 protein levels over three independent
experiments were quantified upon Yki or Rae1 RNAi. (H) Over-expression of constitutively
active Yap constructs (YapS127A or YapS5A) where some or all of the Lats consensus sites have
been mutated did not increase human Myc-Rae1 protein levels compared to control-trans-
fected cells. Relative levels of Rae1 (normalized to Tubulin) are indicated in H.

S4 Fig. Rae1 modulation in proliferating cells modulates organ size. (A) qPCR indicates the
reduction in relative mRNA levels of Rae1 upon RNAi using actgal4 and Rae1IRV, and the
increase in Rae1 levels upon Rae1 over-expression using actgal4 and Rae102 and Rae103 trans-
genes. Low-level constitutive Rae1 RNAi with actgal4 led to approximately 50% reduction,
whereas Rae102 over-expression increased levels to almost eight-fold over endogenous and
Rae103 to two-fold over endogenous. (B-D) RNAi to Rae1 in the posterior compartment of the
wing (C-D) causes a Rae1 dose-dependent reduction in wing size compared to controls
(en>dcr, B). (E-G) RNAi to Rae1 in the whole wing (F-G) causes a Rae1 dose-dependent
decrease in wing size compared to controls (c5gal4/+, E). (H) Control nubgal4 wing. (I-J)
Decreasing Rae1 by RNAi (nub>Rae1IRT) reduces wing size. (K-K’) RNAi to Rae1 in a stripe in
the developing wing using dppgal4 and Rae1IRV (dpp>dcr, Rae1IRV) reduces the area of the
wing between the L3 and L4 wing veins (region highlighted in K’) in both males and females
and also reduced overall wing area compared to controls. N = 13, 11 (females), N = 14, 14
(males). (L) Quantification of eyes shown in Fig 2G–2J. RNAi to Rae1 reduces eye size;
increased reduction is seen in the presence of dcr and at higher temperatures. N = 20, 14, 14,
10. (M) Quantification of eyes shown in Fig 2K. Eyes containing primarily homozygous
Rae1ex28 tissue are smaller than control eyes. Entire eye size was measured; in some cases, the
eyes were composed primarily of unflipped tissue with little to no Rae1ex28 tissue. N = 16, 8
(males), N = 15, 14 (females). (N) The reduced eye size of Rae1 RNAi (ey>dcr, Rae1IRV, left eye
in N) is suppressed by over-expressing Rae1 using transgenes Rae102, Rae103, Rae1GFP (ey>dcr,
Rae1IRV, Rae102, right eye in N; male eyes are shown). (O-P) The reduced wing size due to
Rae1 RNAi in the posterior wing (en>dcr, Rae1IRV, O and red tracing in P) is suppressed by
Rae1 over-expression using transgenes Rae102, Rae103, Rae1GFP (en>dcr, Rae1IRV, Rae102). (Q)
Quantification of eyes undergoing Rae1 RNAi or Rae1 over-expression using GMR gal4 (as
shown in Fig 2L and 2S). N = 16,17,19,14 (females). (R) Constitutive Rae1 over-expression
(Act>Rae102, Act>Rae103) increases body length and wing area compared to actgal4/+ con-
trols. N = 18, 17, 12 (females) and N = 17, 17, 5 (males). (S) Constitutive Rae1 over-expression
(act>Rae1GFP, right eye in S, pink tracing in S’) increases eye size relative to controls (actgal4,
left eye in S, black tracing in S’). (T) Over-expressing Rae1 in clones, in actively dividing cells in
the early eye (shown for ey>Rae103) resulted in a normal pattern of ELAV staining. Scale bar
indicates 35 μM. (U) Constitutive Yki over-expression (act>YkiV5) decreases eye size relative
to controls. (V-V’) Yki over-expression in the proliferating eye cells decreases eye size
(ey>YkiV5, right in V, orange tracing in V’) compared to control eyes (eygal4/+, left in V, black
tracing in V’).

S5 Fig. Loss of Rae1 results in proliferation phenotypes but not in aberrant cell size, differ-
entiation, or survival. (A) Reduced organ size was not due to reduced cell size. Mosaic analysis
using flip-out methods (hsFLP; Act>y+>gal4, UAS GFP/UAS Rae1IRV) positively labeled
RNAi clones with GFP. Mosaic wing discs were dissected, dissociated, and subjected to FACS
analysis. Forward scatter of GFP-positive Rae1 RNAi cells (Rae1IRV, green, normalized cell size
was 1.03, indicated on the top right-hand corner box) showed no statistically different cell size
compared to GFP-negative wild-type clones (pink, normalized cell size was 1.00) as obvious by
the similar FSC-height peak (indicated on the X-axis). The difference in counts (y-axis) reflects
the greater number of wild-type cells, not cell size. (B) Similar experiments using mosaic analy-
sis and flip-out methods (UAS hsFLP; Act>y+>gal4, UAS GFP/UAS Rae102) positively labeled
over-expression clones with GFP. Forward scatter of GFP-positive Rae1 over-expressing cells

GFP-negative wild-type clones (pink, relative cell size of 1.00) as obvious by the similar FSC-

height peak (indicated on the X-axis). (C-D) TUNEL assays indicating cell death showed no
obvious change between eygal4/+ controls (C), ey>Rae1IRN2 (D), and ey>Rae1IRV in third
instar larval eye discs. (E) Over-expressing the caspase inhibitor p35 did not suppress the
reduced eye size upon Rae1 RNAi. N = 11, 16. Parallel experiments in the presence of dcr2 gave
similar results. (F) RNAi of Rae1 in actively dividing cells in the early eye (shown for
ey>Rae1IRN2) resulted in a normal pattern of ELAV staining, indicating photoreceptor differ-
entiation progresses normally. (G-H’) Clones undergoing constitutive Rae1 RNAi (green in G,
H) showed decreased BrdU incorporation (red in G, H panels in G’, H’), shown here in two
examples of entire discs from two different RNAi lines. Reduced BrdU incorporation was most
evident in clones in the SMW, possibly because division synchronizes in the SMW. (I-I’) Rae1
RNAi clones (green in I) (using Rae1IRV and Rae1IRN2 (shown for Rae1IRV), showed no obvious
decrease in pHH3 staining (red I, panel I’). (J-M) Wing disc images (of discs quantified in 3F)
undergoing Rae1 reduction through heterozygosity at the Rae1 locus (c5gal4, Rae1ex28/+, K),
Rae1 RNAi in the whole wing disc (c5>Rae1IRV, L) or both (c5>Rae1IRV, Rae1ex28/+, M) show
an increase in pHH3 positive cells relative to control wing discs (c5gal4/+, J). Scale bars in I-L
indicate 100 μm. (N) Graph showing the percentage of pHH3-positive S2 cells per total cells
when treated with Rae1 RNAi (blue hashed bar) or control RNAi (blue bar). Rae1 RNAi
increases the mitotic index (percentage of pHH3-positive cells). (O-P) BrdU incorporation
(white) in (O) control eygal4/+ disc and (P) an eye disc undergoing Rae1 RNAi in actively
dividing cells (ey>Rae1IRV). (Q-R) CycB staining (white) appeared similar in the region poste-
rior the SMW in an eygal4/+ control disc (Q) as in a disc undergoing Rae1 RNAi in (R,
ey>Rae1IRV). Importantly, the high pHH3 staining posterior to the SMW but lack of BrdU
incorporation suggests the pHH3 positive cells are not actively cycling. pHH3 staining but lack
of CycB staining suggests these cells are in a stage of the cell cycle after CycB degradation but
before the mitotic phosphorylation is removed from Histone H3, such as anaphase or early
telophase. Parallel experiments in the presence of dcr2 gave similar results. Scale bars in C-D,
G indicate 50μm, in F, Q-R indicate 35μm, in H, O-P indicate 25 μm, and in J-M indicate

size reduction of RNAi to Rae1 in the early eye (ey>dcr, Rae1IRV, I). (M) Quantification of eyes
from I-L except male eyes over-expressing cycA. Increased lethality of cycA over-expression in
this context resulted in few males for quantification. N = 14, 13, 13 (males), N = 12, 12,1 8, 15
(females). (N-Q) Increased expression of cycE (O), cycA (P), or cycB3 (Q) in the early eye does
not increase eye size compared to controls (N). (R) Quantification of eyes in N-Q. Increased
lethality of cycA over-expression in this context resulted in few males for quantification. CycA
over-expression on its own reduced eye size. N = 12, 17, 12 (males), N = 16, 17, 13, 17
(females). (S-S’) Rae1 over-expressing clones (green in S, tracing in S’) show increased cycA
staining (red). Arrow in D’ indicates more intense cycA staining. Quantifying staining intensity
suggests cycA staining increases more than 50% in the SMW. Arrowheads in S-S’ indicate the
MF. (T-U) Over-expressing Rae1 in actively dividing cells (U) increased the intensity of cyclin
B staining anterior to the furrow and in the SMW compared to control eygal4/+ discs (T). (V)

S9 Fig. Hippo over-expression organ size phenotypes are sensitive to downstream targets.
(A-C) Transgenic over-expression of hpo in differentiating eye cells (GMR Hpo) is responsive
to temperature. Increasing the temperature increases expression levels of Hpo, and therefore
increases the severity of the phenotype. GMR Hpo eyes were small and rough at 25°C (A), and
became smaller, rougher, and showed increased appearance of black tissue at 28°C (B) and
30°C (C). (D) The presence of black tissue was quantified over a range of temperatures. N = 46,
60, 156, 38, 142 (males), N = 48, 58, 130, 60, 222 (females). (E-F) Removing one copy of wts by
introducing the mutant allele wts3-17 suppressed the GMR Hpo eye size and black tissue pheno-
types at 28°C (E) and 30°C (F). (G) Quantification of the black tissue showed modification of
the GMR Hpo phenotype by adjusting wts gene dosage. This indicates that the black tissue phe-
notype can be used to reflect genetic modification of Hpo over-expression phenotypes. N = 38,
30, 142, 42 (males), N = 60, 34, 222, 44 (females). (H) Removing one copy of Rae1 by introduc-
ing the deletion allele Rae1ex28 (right eye, pink tracing in H’) further reduced GMR Hpo (left
eye, black tracing in H’) eye size at 30°C (highlighted by tracings in H’) and enhanced the
appearance of black tissue. (I) Quantification of black tissue appearance highlights the domi-
nant enhancement by the Rae1ex28 allele at 28°C. (J-J’) Removing one copy of Rae1 using the
deficiency Df(2R)ED3923 (right eye in J, pink tracing in J’), enhanced the phenotype of GMR
Hpo (left eye in J, black tracing in J’) in terms of increasing eye roughness and further reducing
eye size. (K-K’) Rae1 RNAi in differentiating eye cells using GMRgal4 and Rae1IRV
(GMR>Rae1IRV) (right in in K, pink tracing in K’) enhanced the phenotype of over-expressing
Sav and Wts in differentiating eye cells (GMR Sav, Wts) (left eye in K, black tracing in K’).

S11 Fig. Tissue overgrowing due to impaired Hippo kinase activity is sensitive to Rae1 lev-
els. (A) Control wing (c5gal4/+). (B) RNAi to Rae1 (c5>Rae1IRT) causes a moderate reduction
in wing size. (C) Over-expression of a kinase-dead Hpo transgene (c5>hpoKD) moderately
increases wing size relative to controls (A). (D) This moderate overgrowth is suppressed by
RNAi to Rae1. (c5>hpoKD, Rae1IRT). (E) Control wing (c5gal4/+). (F) RNAi to Rae1
(c5>Rae1IRT) causes a more dramatic reduction in wing size at 27°C. (G) Over-expression of a
kinase-dead Hpo transgene (c5>hpoKD) promotes wing overgrowth relative to controls (E).
(H) RNAi to Rae1 suppresses the dramatic overgrowth and also impairs the survival of over-
growing tissue caused by loss of Hippo activity (c5>hpoKD, Rae1IRT). (I-I’) Reducing Rae1 lev-
els by introducing the Rae1ex28 allele caused a low penetrance of tissue collapse in the
background of hippo signaling impairment (c5>hpoKD, Rae1ex28/+, I’). (J-J’) The Rae1IRV
shows less dramatic phenotypes than the Rae1IRT transgene. Reducing Rae1 levels by RNAi
caused a moderate penetrance of tissue collapse (c5>hpoKD, Rae1IRV, J’). (L) Control wing
(nub>dcr). (M) RNAi to Rae1 (nub>dcr, Rae1IRT) causes a reduction in wing size. (N) Over-
expression of a kinase-dead Hpo transgene (nub>dcr, hpoKD) increases wing size relative to
controls (L). (O) This overgrowth is suppressed by RNAi to Rae1 (nub>dcr, hpoKD, Rae1IRT).
(P) Control wing (nub>dcr) at 27°C. (Q) RNAi to Rae1 (nub>dcr, Rae1IRT) causes a more dra-
matic reduction in wing size at 27°C. (R) Over-expression of a kinase-dead Hpo (nub>dcr,
hpoKD) increases wing size relative to controls at 27°C (R). (S) RNAi to Rae1 suppresses this
overgrowth and promotes shriveling and blistering of wings (nub>dcr, hpoKD, Rae1IRT).

S12 Fig. Reducing Rae1 suppresses overgrowth and impairs tissue survival upon reduction
in Hippo signaling, but not upon over-expressing the myc oncogene or the caspase inhibi-
tor p35. (A-B) Typically, RNAi to Mer (A, en>dcr, MerIRN) leads to less overgrowth than
RNAi to the other tumor suppressor components ex, hpo, and wts. In cases where we saw less
overgrowth, concurrently reducing Rae1 (B, en>dcr, MerIRN, Rae1IRV) suppressed overgrowth
and often led to blistering and other mild phenotypes of tissue loss. This is consistent with the
requirement for Rae1 changing depending on the extent of overgrowth. (C-D) Overgrowth due
to loss of Hippo Pathway tumor components in the wing is often so dramatic that wings no
longer lie flat; mounted wings thus wrongly appear smaller once they are flattened to be photo-
graphed. These images of flies with their wings still attached highlight how extensive the

overgrowth is upon hpo RNAi (C, en>dcr, hpoIRT) and how effectively reducing Rae1 sup-
pressed this overgrowth (D, en>dcr, hpoIRT, Rae1IRV). (E-F) Reducing yki levels did not cause
the same tissue lethality we saw with Rae1; yki RNAi (F, en>hpoIRT, ykiIRN) suppressed the
overgrowth but did not impair the survival of tissue overgrowing due to loss of hpo (E and blue
tracing in F, en>hpoIRT). (G) Control c5gal4/+ wing. (H) RNAi to wts (c5>wtsIRT) caused wing
overgrowth. (I) Removing one copy of Rae1 (c5>wtsIRT; Rae1ex28/+) caused tissue loss. (J)
RNAi to yki (c5>wtsIRT; ykiIRN) suppressed overgrowth but did not cause tissue loss. (K) Creat-
ing random clones undergoing concurrent RNAi to both Rae1 and hpo causes patches of dying
tissue throughout the fly. Image is of a dissected pharate adult showing black spots in the eye,
and other large swaths of black tissue elsewhere. (L-O) The tissue lethality phenotype appears
to be specific and did not occur for other overgrowth phenotypes we tested, shown here for
over-expressing the myc oncogene and the caspase inhibitor p35. (L, black tracing in M) Con-
trol wing over-expressing the myc oncogene (en>dcr, mycWT). (M) Rae1 RNAi suppressed the
overgrowth but did not cause tissue lethality in myc over-expressing wings (en>dcr, mycWT,
Rae1IRV). (N, black tracing in O) Control wing over-expressing the caspase inhibitor p35
(en>dcr, p35). (O) Rae1 RNAi suppressed the overgrowth but did not cause tissue lethality in
p35 over-expressing wings (en>dcr, p35, Rae1IRV).

S13 Fig. Reducing Rae1 suppresses overgrowth upon over-expressing the Yki oncogene.
(A) Control c5gal4/+ wing at 27°C. (B) Yki over-expression (c5>YkiV5) caused wing over-
growth at 27°C. (C-D) Removing one copy of Rae1 by introducing Rae1ex28 (c5>YkiV5;
Rae1ex28/+, C) or RNAi to Rae1 (c5>YkiV5; Rae1IRV/+, D) at 27°C subtly but reproducibly
increased overgrowth. (E) Control engal4/+ wing at 27°C. (F) Yki over-expression (en>YkiV5)
caused mild wing overgrowth in the posterior compartment at 27°C. (G) Removing one copy
of Rae1 by introducing Rae1ex28 (en>YkiV5; Rae1ex28/+) increased wing overgrowth caused by
Yki over-expression. (H) RNAi to Rae1 (en>YkiV5; Rae1IRV/+) at 27°C suppressed overgrowth.
(I) Control nub>dcr wing at 27°C. (J) Yki over-expression (nub>dcr, YkiV5) caused mild wing
overgrowth in wing at 27°C. (K) Removing one copy of Rae1 by introducing Rae1ex28
(nub>dcr, YkiV5; Rae1ex28/+) increased wing overgrowth caused by Yki over-expression. (L)
RNAi to Rae1 (nub>dcr, YkiV5; Rae1IRV/+) at 27°C dramatically suppressed overgrowth. (M)
Control wing (en>dcr). (N) Over-expressing Yki leads to wing overgrowth (N, and yellow
overlay in O). (O) Reducing Rae1 levels slightly by removing one copy suppressed tissue over-
growth but did not cause tissue collapse. (P) Control wing (c5gal4/+). (Q) Over-expressing a
different Yki transgene leads to wing overgrowth (E, and yellow overlay in F). (R) Reducing
Rae1 levels slightly by removing one copy did not cause tissue collapse. Overgrowth in this con-
text is quite dramatic such that wings no longer lie flat; mounted wings thus wrongly appear
smaller once they are flattened to be photographed. (S-S’) Over-expressing Yki in the differen-
tiating cells of the adult eye causes a larger eye (left in S, black tracing in S’). Reducing Rae1 lev-
els by concurrent Rae1 RNAi (GMR>YkiV5, Rae1IRV, right in S, pink tracing in S’) further
increases eye size. (T-T’) Over-expressing a constitutively active Yki transgene in the differenti-
ating cells of the adult eye causes a larger eye (left in T, black tracing in T’). Reducing Rae1 lev-
els by concurrent Rae1 RNAi (GMR>YkiS168A, Rae1IRV, right in T, pink tracing in T’) further
increases eye size. (U) Reducing Rae1 levels slightly by removing one copy (lane 3) or by RNAi
(lane 4) increases Yki-V5 levels in larval salivary glands (lane 2). Rae1 reduction also reduced
the proportion of a slower migrating species. Relative distribution of both bands of Yki are
indicated.

S14 Fig. Hippo signaling negatively regulates pools of Rae1 at the cell membrane and in the
cytoplasm. (A-A”) Transfecting FLAG-Rae1 into S2 cells shows Rae1 association with the cell
periphery, cytoplasm, and nucleus. (B-B”) Co-transfecting FLAG-Rae1 with myc-Hpo into S2
cells reduced Rae1 levels, particularly at the cell periphery and cytoplasm. All images (A-B)
were taken with identical exposure times and settings. Scale bars in A-B indicate 5 μm. (C-C”)
Over-expressing a Rae1-GFP transgene in the salivary glands shows strong Rae1-GFP localiza-
tion to the nuclear periphery but also localization to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. (D-D”)
Co-over-expressing the Rae1-GFP with Hpo reduces the levels of Rae1 in salivary glands and
specifically causes a reduction in the Rae1-GFP pools associated with the cell membrane and
cytoplasm. There is also a reduction of Rae1 associated with the nuclear periphery and the pool
of Rae1 in the nucleus appears to be associated with chromatin. All images (C-D) were taken
with identical exposure times and settings. Scale bars in C-D indicate 20 μm.
