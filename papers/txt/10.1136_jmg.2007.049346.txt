Background: Malignancy risks in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are increased, but those occurring
outside of the nervous system have not been clearly defined.
Aim: To evaluate the risk of breast cancer in women with NF1 in a population-based study.
Methods: The risk of breast cancer in a cohort of 304 women with NF1 aged >20 years was assessed and
compared with population risks over the period 1975–2005 using a person-years-at-risk analysis.
Results: There were 14 cases of breast cancers in the follow-up period, yielding a standardised incidence
ratio (SIR) of 3.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 5.9). However, six breast cancers occurred in women in their 40s, and the
SIR of breast cancer in women aged ,50 years was 4.9 (95% CI 2.4 to 8.8).
Interpretation: Women with NF1 aged ,50 years have a fivefold risk of breast cancer, are in the moderate
risk category and should be considered for mammography from 40 years of age.

N eurofibromatosis 1 (NF1; MIM 162200) is a common

autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an estimated
birth incidence of 1 in 2500 and a prevalence of 1 in
5000.1 NF1 is a fully penetrant condition, with all patients
manifesting signs of the disease by the age of 5 years. However,
many de novo cases remain undiagnosed well into adult life. All
affected individuals will develop at
the
neurocutaneous features, none of which are life threatening;
these include the pigmentary changes (cafe´ au lait spots, skin
fold freckling and Lisch nodules) and neurofibromas (although
these may not be numerous). It is the occurrence of disease
complications that causes most of the associated morbidity and
mortality. A third of affected individuals will develop at least
one of the more severe disease complications in their lifetime;
the occurrence of complications cannot be predicted even
within families.2 The disease is extremely variable, and the
individual gene fault is unlikely to determine the total course of
the condition.

The NF1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene and those with the
mutation are at a fourfold increased risk of cancer compared
with the general population.3–5 The gene product neurofibromin
is thought to deliver much of its function through down-
regulating the oncogene ras. Patients with NF1 have a greatly
increased relative risk of developing gliomas, malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumours, juvenile chronic myelomo-
nocytic leukaemia, rhabdomyosarcoma and phaeochromocy-
toma; such tumours may have a different natural history from
those occurring sporadically, and require a specific approach to
their detection and management.

Until now no one has reported an overall significantly
increased risk of any commonly occurring cancers in patients
with NF1, although a recent paper did find a significantly
increased risk in women aged ,50 years—this was not
significant overall.6 The fact that several patients develop breast
cancer before 50 years of age prompted us to look system-
atically for an increased risk of breast cancer.

METHODS
The Regional Genetic Service in Manchester covers the north-
west of England (excluding Merseyside)—a population of
about 4.1 million. Patients with NF1 are referred from all
healthcare sectors and lay groups; they are also identified via
known families who are followed up over generations as part of
the genetic register service. A genetic register for patients with
NF1 has been in existence since 1989, and patients consent to
regular contact, research and data collection. All patients and
any deceased affected relatives are entered onto a comprehen-
sive clinical database with information on clinical features and
date of last assessment. Other major health problems, including
tumours, are recorded. A clinical geneticist confirms all the
diagnoses of NF1. The register cohort is therefore a relatively
unbiased population-based group of patients.

The database (as of 1 July 2005) was searched for the
diagnosis of breast cancer, and the NF1 dataset was also
checked against the North Western Cancer Registry (NWCR)
database to obtain as complete case ascertainment as possible.
It is important to note that the study started with known
patients having NF1, and did not select patients on the basis of
their breast cancer status.

The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of invasive breast
cancer was estimated by calculating the ratio of observed to
expected numbers of cases. Expected numbers were calculated
using incidence rates for the period 1 January 1975 to 31 June
2005 for the population covered by the NWCR (although the
NWCR started collecting data in 1962, its rates were not robust
until 1975). As incidence rates for 2004 and 2005 were not
available, 2003 rates were used for each of these years. Age
group-, sex- and calendar-period-specific person-years at risk
were multiplied by the corresponding incidence rates to
produce the number of expected cases.

Follow-up of women was started on 1 January 1975 or on
their 20th birthday, whichever was the later. Patients were
censored at the date of diagnosis of their breast cancer, last
follow-up or date of death, whichever was the earliest.

The cumulative risk of breast cancer to age 50 years was
calculated by adding the age-specific rates for each 5-year age
group from 20–24 to 45–49, followed by application of the
formula: cumulate risk = 1006[12exp (2cum rate/100)].

RESULTS
On 1st July 2005, 848 patients with NF1 were on the NF1
database, of which 418 were women. Eight were excluded
because of insufficient data, and five died before 1975. Of the
remaining 405, 304 were aged >20 years during at least part of
the follow-up period and were considered to be at risk of
developing breast cancer. The total person-years at risk were
5411 (median 17.8 years). A total of 788 living patients with
NFI is equivalent to a population prevalence of 1 in 5200.

Of the 304 women, 14 were identified as having had invasive
breast cancer; 3 had at least two separate primary breast
cancers, but only the first tumour was included in the SIR
analysis. Table 1 shows the observed and expected number of
cases of breast cancer.

The SIR of developing breast cancer was 3.5 (95% CI 1.9 to
5.9). The earlier average age of onset is reflected by the
increased SIR of 4.9 (95% CI 2.4 to 8.8) up to age 50 years. The
cumulative risk of developing breast cancer to age 50 years in
women in the general population was 2%,7 and that of the
women with NF1 was 8.4%. Six women developed their first
breast cancer between 40 and 49 years of age, resulting in a risk
of 5.8% during that decade. The age of diagnosis of NF1 ranged
from 0 to 54 years for the total population with NF1 and from 5
to 39 years in the 14 women with breast cancer. Median age at
diagnosis of NF1 was 4 years for the total population, compared
with 20 years for women with breast cancer (table 2).

All 304 women had cafe´ au lait spots, 219 (72%) had skin
fold freckling, 195 (64%) had neurofibromas and 167 (55%)
had Lisch nodules. These women had an early age of onset of
breast cancer, with a median (range) age of diagnosis of 44
(27–64) years, although all had a prior diagnosis of NF1
(table 2). Histology was available for all women, including
further primaries: 14 women had infiltrating ductal carcinoma,
3 had infiltrating lobular carcinoma and 1 had contralateral
ductal carcinoma in situ (table 2). Only 1 of the 14 women was
known to carry a BRCA1 (2190 delA) mutation. None of the
other families fulfilled the criteria for mutational analysis.7 Of
the 14 women, 5 died from metastatic breast cancer, 2 from a
primary cancer at another site (lung, fallopian tube) and 1 from
myocardial
infarction. The details of death entered on the
cancer registry from death certification made no reference to
the diagnosis of NF1 in any of these women. The six remaining
patients were alive at the last follow-up. In view of the reported
reduced genetic fitness in NF1, we analysed the possible effect

of late first pregnancy or nulliparity on the breast cancer cases.
Of the 14 women, 3 were nulliparous. Of the 11 parous women,
9 had had their first pregnancy before the age of 30 years
(mean age 25.5 years; median 25; range 19–35). Therefore, 9 of
14 women should have had protective reproductive risk factors
for breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
Although a recent cohort study showed an increased risk of
breast cancer in women aged ,50 years,6 this was based on
small numbers, and the overall significance was not obtained.
The present study is the first to report a significantly increased
risk of a common cancer across all age groups in NF1. Our
results show that women with NF1 have an overall SIR of
breast cancer of 3.5 and a 4.9-fold risk of developing breast
cancer to age 50 years, compared with women in the general
population. Their risk of developing breast cancer by the 50th
birthday is 8.4%.

Although it is possible that we underascertained patients
with NF1 for our region, the prevalence of 1 in 5200 in our
study is very similar to that for other highly ascertained
population studies.8 Although we could have missed milder
patients with NF1 who may have had a lower risk, our analysis
almost certainly reflects the risks to a woman significantly
affected enough to get a clinical diagnosis. Cases of breast
cancer were also obtained from two independent sources, so
that we would have been unlikely to miss any case of breast
cancer in our families with NF1. It is possible that patients with
both breast cancer and NF1 may have been diagnosed between
1975 and 1989 and so had not come to our attention because
they died from the disease, but including such cases would
actually have increased the SIR. A bias would have occurred if
women with NF1 and breast cancer were more likely to be
included in the study than those with only NF1. As NF1 was
diagnosed first in all 14 women, the extra medical attention
after a diagnosis of breast cancer could not have led to a
diagnosis of NF1 in these women. As no relationship had been
reported until recently between NF1 and breast cancer, it is
unlikely that a diagnosis of NF1 would have brought forward a
diagnosis of breast cancer. Even with mammography screening
under 50 years, the lead time is only 18 months, and these
women were not undergoing surveillance. Although the age at
diagnosis of NF1 was older in our women with breast cancer,
this is likely to reflect increasing awareness of the condition in
recent years rather than a different mechanism. In particular,
our NF1 register since 1989 has diagnosed many offspring of
patients with NF1 in the first year of life, bringing the overall
age at diagnosis down to a much younger age. Even today de
novo patients with NF1 are often not diagnosed until their 30s
or 40s. Another potential criticism of our study is the
semiretrospective aspect. We started follow-up in 1975 to
increase the power of the study. In fact, only 2 of 14 breast
cancer cases first occurred before 1989, and exclusion of the
extra 14 years would,
if anything, have increased the SIR.
Another possible explanation for an increased risk would have
been reduced genetic fitness and therefore nulliparity. This was
not supported as a plausible explanation for the increased risk
seen.

Our findings,

if confirmed by other groups, have major
implications for patients with NF1, as regards the early
diagnosis of breast cancers. The 2004 National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines define the risk of
developing breast cancer as 1.5% in women aged 40–49 years in
the UK population.7 Those with a 3–8% risk are considered to be
at moderately increased risk; such individuals are deemed
suitable for breast cancer screening from 40 years of age, unlike
women in the UK general population. Women with NF1 are the

first group of patients at increased genetic risk of breast cancer,
which is easily identified on routine examination by any
physician.7 It is important that patients and physicians are
aware of the increased risk and that steps are taken to ensure
early diagnosis of palpable tumours. The use of radiotherapy in
NF1 will need to be a particular area of focus. There are
increasing concerns of an increased risk of further malignancies
after radiation therapy in tumour-prone disorders,9–17 which is
particularly true for children with NF1.18 However, there is no
evidence to suggest that the small doses associated with
mammography would be sufficient
to increase the risk,
although this may need addressing further before widespread
implementation of extra screening.

This study reports a relationship between NF1 and breast
cancer. Not all of this increased risk may be due to the presence
of NF1. Further studies are needed to compare the risk profiles
for breast cancer in those with and without NF1, and to
determine whether any factors that are more common in those
with NF1 are simply associations or part of a causal mechanism
by which NF1 increases the risk of breast cancer.

Recent scientific data support a possible association between
breast cancer and NF1. It has been suggested that there may be
genes that could interact with the NF1 gene, particularly in
relation to the BRCA1 subset. They could share a common gene
location (both NF1 and BRCA1 are on human chromosome
17q),19 which has been conserved between man and mouse,20 or
another breast cancer gene may also interact.21 Ceccaroni et al19
showed the inheritance of a common haplotype including both
the NF1 and the BRCA1 genes in relatives of patients with NF1
and breast cancer, and a mutation in the BRCA1 gene was also
detected in the patients. Altered expression of the NF1 protein
neurofibromin in breast cell lines with upregulation of Ras22 has
been seen and could suggest an overlapping aetiology.
However, it is not known whether the lack of neurofibromin
is a primary or a secondary event in this sequence. Guran and
Safali23 have shown loss of heterozygosity for NF1 in breast
tumours from a woman with NF1, but loss of the long arm of
chromosome 17 is common in breast cancers. No germline NF1,
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation was identified in the proband in this

report. Nonetheless, they suggested a role of the NF1 gene in
the progression of tumour. The progression of cancer diagnoses
in our patient (table 2, patient 13) with a concomitant BRCA1
mutation is severe even for BRCA1. An argument could be made
to exclude the BRCA1 case from the analysis. This would have
reduced the SIRs to 3.25 overall, and to 4.5 for those aged
,50 years. However, in any population large enough to carry
other gene mutations, these will occur as they will in any
comparison with the general population. One BRCA1/2 carrier
would have been expected among over 300 women, with a
combined population frequency of 1 in 4–500.6 The tumour
distribution and histology excluding the BRCA1 case was not
consistent with a predominantly basal phenotype, as would be
expected with BRCA1-related breast cancers (table 2).

An obvious question arising from our data is why this
association has not been reported before. The increased risk of
malignancy in NF1 has been known for some time, the SIR for
all tumour types being up to four times that seen in the general
population.4 5 Certain tumours are seen more commonly at
particular ages, and there is also an increased risk of developing
second tumours.1 4 5 24–31

Several groups have reviewed the types and incidence of
malignancies in patients with NF1.1 4 5 25–27 The majority of
these studies were too small to identify significant cancer
excess outside the known extremely high relative incidence of
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, rhabdomyosar-
coma, glioma and juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.
It is interesting to note that in previous studies breast cancer
has been reported in women with NF1,4 5 27 but no specific
attempt has been made to determine whether this was at a
greater than expected frequency.

Although a death certificate study in North America was
potentially large enough to provide a robust estimate of the risk
of breast cancer, the analysis is flawed by the necessity of NF1
to be stated on the death certificate as a secondary feature.32 As
breast cancer has not previously been reported as related to
NF1, it is doubtful whether clinicians would have recorded the
diagnosis of NF1 on the death certificate. It is of note that none
of our five cases of deaths from breast cancer had the NF1

diagnosis on the death certificate. Also, as breast cancer is often
cured, many women with breast cancer would have been
excluded from the study.

Several authors have tried to overcome the above biases by
identifying a live group of patients based either on NF1 status1 4
or on a diagnosis of cancer.26 However, many of these studies
have other biases. Cross-sectional studies such as the Welsh
study1 will not give accurate risks as they exclude deceased
cases, and a longitudinal component is needed as the median
age for a diagnosis of breast cancer is much older than for NF1.
Studies that identified subjects on the basis of their cancer
status may miss mildly affected individuals with NF1 who have
not been diagnosed or known to clinics performing these
analyses, and would have difficulty calculating a robust
estimate of the number of expected cases of NF1.

Identifying a population-based cohort of patients with NF1
who are followed over time to determine the number who
develop breast cancer is the only way to provide an unbiased
estimate of relative risk. The most recent study of this type
included 448 individuals (227 women, 40% of whom were
,20 years at the start of follow-up) ascertained through the UK
Neurofibromatosis Association.6 They showed a marginally
significantly increased risk of breast cancer of fourfold (95%
CI 1.09 to 10.3) in women aged ,50 years. However, the overall
breast cancer incidence was not significantly increased, so they
did not highlight this finding. Our study included considerably
more follow-up years for adult women (about three fold), and
so has the power to provide a better estimate of risk. The
Walker et al6 study was not strictly population based but did
follow a defined cohort. The results from both our own and the
Walker et al6 study show a significantly raised SIR for breast
cancer in those aged ,50 years, suggesting that the increased
risk is concentrated before the age of 50 years.

Thus, we have shown that breast cancer should be considered
as a common association in NF1, and that affected women will
require screening for this from the age of 40 years. We need to
clarify further the exact incidence of breast cancer in these
patients, understand the aetiology and natural history of these
tumours, and determine the best way of managing such
patients. This report will help to raise awareness and in turn
enable further studies to define this recent association with
NF1.
