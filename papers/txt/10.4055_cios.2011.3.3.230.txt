Background: Fibrous hamartoma is the key pathology of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT), which was shown to have 
low osteogenicity and high osteoclastogenicity. This study further investigated the mechanism of impaired osteoblastic differen-
tiation of ﬁ brous hamartoma cells.
Methods: Fibroblast-like cells were obtained from enzymatically dissociated ﬁ brous hamartomas of 11 patients with CPT as-
sociated with neuroﬁ bromatosis type I (NF1). Periosteal cells were also obtained from the distal tibial periosteum of 3 patients 
without CPT or NF1 as control. The mRNA levels of Wnt ligands and their canonical receptors, such as Lrp5 and β-catenin, were 
assayed using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Changes in mRNA expression of osteoblast marker genes by rhBMP2 treatment 
were assayed using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression of transcription factors speciﬁ cally involved in 
osteoblastic differentiation by rhBMP2 treatment was also assayed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
Results: Wnt1 and Wnt3a mRNA expression was lower in ﬁ brous hamartoma than in tibial periosteal cells, but their canonical 
receptors did not show signiﬁ cant difference. Response of osteoblastic marker gene expression to rhBMP2 treatment showed 
patient-to-patient variability. Col1a1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in most ﬁ brous hamartoma tissues, osteocalcin was up-
regulated in a small number of patients, and ALP expression was down-regulated in most ﬁ brous hamartoma tissues. Changes in 
mRNA expression of the transcription factors in response to rhBMP2 also showed factor-to-factor and patient-to-patient variabil-
ity. Dlx5 was consistently up-regulated by rhBMP2 treatment in all ﬁ brous hamartoma tissues tested. Msx2 expression was down-
regulated by rhBMP2 in most cases but by lesser extent than control tissue. Runx2 expression was up-regulated in 8 out of 18 
ﬁ brous hamartoma tissues tested. Osterix expression was up-regulated in 2 and down-regulated in 3 ﬁ brous hamartoma tissues.
Conclusions: Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia appears to be caused by ﬁ brous hamartoma originating from aberrant growth 
of Nf1 haploinsufﬁ cient periosteal cells, which failed in terminal osteoblastic differentiation and arrested at a certain stage of this 
process. This pathomechanism of CPT should be targeted in the development of novel therapeutic biologic intervention.

Lee et al. Osteoblastic Diff erentiation in Congenital Pseudarthrosis

Clinics in Orthopedic Surgery • Vol. 3, No. 3, 2011 • www.ecios.org

Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a very rare 
but specifi c condition characterized by anterolateral bow-
ing at birth, and recurrent pathologic fractures of the tibia 
during early childhood. Fracture usually occurs spontane-
ously or aft er minor trauma and rarely heals without ap-
propriate surgical intervention, and easily results in pseud-
arthrosis.

 Fibrous hamartoma tissue is regarded as the key 
pathology of CPT,1) which occupies the site of pseudar-
throsis, and is continuous with abnormally thickened peri-
osteum in the adjacent bone segment.

CPT frequently develops in patients with neurofi-
bromatosis type 1 (NF1). It was reported that association 
with NF1 was found in 40 to 60 per cent of CPT patients,2) 
and CPT develops in 1 to 4 percent of patients with NF1.3) 
NF1 is one of the most common autosomal dominant 
disorders, aff ecting approximately 1 in 3500 births.4) It is 
characterized by neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, Lisch 
nodules and numerous skeletal manifestations, such as 
macrocephaly, short stature, kyphoscoliosis, sphenoid 
wing dysplasia, congenital bowing and congenital pseud-
arthrosis of the tibia.

 NF1 is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the 
Nf1 gene located in chromosome 17q11.2.5) Th  is gene en-

codes neurofi bromin, which is expressed in a wide range 
of cells and tissues,6) including maturing chondrocytes, 
hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and 
osteoclasts.7) It is also expressed in tissues around CPT.8) 
Neurofibromin negatively regulates the activity of an in-
tracellular signaling molecule p21ras (Ras), by functioning 
as a GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP).9,10) Haploinsuf-
ficiency or complete deficiency in Nf1 gene function re-
sults in a dose-dependent elevation in Ras activity, which 
can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase 
(PI-3K) pathway.11)

 The Nf1 gene is classified as a tumor suppressor 
gene. Heterozygous Nf1+/– mice experienced tumors and 
premature death.12) Chimeric mice containing moderate 
levels of Nf1–/– defi cient cells went on to form numerous 
neurofi bromas, which progressed to malignancy with loss 
of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.13) Furthermore, the loss 
of heterozygosity (LOH) is seen in benign and malignant 
tumors, including neurofibroma, malignant peripheral 
nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and astrocytoma.14,15) 

 Previous studies demonstrated that the phenotype 
of the fi brous hamartoma cells is consistent with the im-
munophenotype of mesenchymal lineage cells as that

of tibial periosteal cells.16,17) However, these cells do not 
undergo osteoblastic differentiation in response to bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP), and they are more osteo-
clastogenic than the tibial periosteal cells.16) In this study, 
we investigated further steps of osteoblastic diff erentiation 
in cells isolated from fi brous hamartoma, in order to de-
lineate the mechanism of impaired osteoblastic diff erentia-
tion of fi brous hamartoma cells.

METHODS

Primary Cell Culture
Th  is study was approved by the institutional review board 
of Seoul National University Hospital. Harvested human 
tissues were investigated in experiments with informed 
consent. Fibrous hamartoma tissue was harvested from 
11 patients (5 male and 6 female) with an atrophic type of 
CPT associated with NF1, during surgical procedures for 
osteosynthesis. Control tissue was obtained from the distal 
tibial periosteum. A strip of about 2 × 5 mm distal tibial 
periosteum was harvested during supramalleolar tibial 
derotation osteotomy from 3 patients without CPT or NF1 
(Table 1). Th  ey underwent tissue culture. Fibrous hamar-
toma or tibial periosteum was enzymatically dissociated 
to obtain fi broblast-like cells, which were plated on a 100-
mm dish, and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS 
and antibiotics at 37oC in 5% CO2. When the second pas-
sage cells reached confl uence, they were trypsinized, fro-
zen, and stored in liquid nitrogen until required. Th  e cells 
from fi brous hamartoma were denoted by the labels listed 
in Table 1 as FH1 through FH11, and cells from the tibial 
periosteum as PC1 through PC3. A vial of cells from one 
confl uent dish were thawed and plated on 100-mm dish. 
When they reached confl uence again, they were re-plated 
in 1:3 ratio, and rhBMP2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, 
MN, USA) treatment was commenced 48 hours aft er plat-
ing. As the amount of tissue harvested from patients was 
limited, not all tissues were used in the experiments (Table 
1).

Wnt Ligands and Receptors Expression
Total RNA was extracted from plated cells using Trizol 
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The mRNA 
expressions of Wnt1, Wnt3a, LRP-5 and β-catenin were as-
sayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(Table 2), to investigate for endogenous Wnt signaling. 
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 
was used as internal control. Regular PCR was performed 
using AccuPower® HotStart PCR Premix (Bioneer, Dae-
jeon, Korea) with primers for each gene (Table 2). Quanti-

tative real-time PCR was performed for Wnt1 and Wnt3a 
as they showed different band intensity in regular PCR. 
After reverse transcription using the SuperScript First-
strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), real-
time PCR was performed in TaqMan Universal PCR 
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) 
using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System 
(Applied Biosystems). To compare diff erent gene expres-
sion levels, threshold cycle (CT) values were compared for 
relative gene expression analysis. Th  e expression levels of 
target genes were presented as ratio to that of GAPDH. All 
samples were amplifi ed four times.

Changes in mRNA Expression by rhBMP Treatment
Th  e plated cells were grown in osteogenic media (DMEM 
containing 10% FBS, 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM 
sodium-glycerophosphate, and 0.05 mM ascorbic acid-2-
phosphate). Th  ey were divided into two groups. Group I 
was grown solely in osteogenic media. Group II was treat-
ed with 100 ng/mL rhBMP2 (R&D Systems) for 2 weeks. 
Total RNA was extracted following 2 weeks of treatment. 
Th  e mRNA levels of osteoblast markers, such as col1a1, os-

teocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney type 
(ALPL), were quantitatively analyzed by real-time RT-PCR 
using ready-made primers. Th  e mRNA levels of transcrip-
tion factors involved in osteoblastic diff erentiation, such as 
Dlx5, Msx2, Runx2, and Osterix, were also quantitatively 
analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using ready-made primers 
(Table 3). Real-time PCR and quantifi cation method was 
identical to that described previously. Th  e expression level 
of rhBMP2 treated cell was divided by that of untreated 
cell to calculate the extent of up-regulation or down-regu-
lation of the expression.

RESULTS

Wnt Ligands and Receptors Expression
Control tissue (PC1) and fi brous hamartoma tissues from 
five patients (FH1-5) underwent quantitative real-time 
RT-PCR for Wnt1 and Wnt3a, and qualitative RT-PCR for 
Lrp-5 and β-catenin. In the fi brous hamartoma from all 5 
CPT patients, the mRNA levels of Wnt ligands were lower 
than that of control tissue. Expression level of these ligands 
varied from patient to patient. The mRNA level of Wnt1 
in the fibrous hamartoma ranged from 3.3% to 34.2% of 
that of normal control tissue, while Wnt3a mRNA expres-
sion level ranged from 0.14% to 13.5%. All tissues showed 
strong mRNA expression of both Lrp-5 and β-catenin in 
RT-PCR (Fig. 1).

Osteoblast Marker Gene Expression Change by BMP 
Treatment
Th  e mRNA level of osteoblast markers, including col1a1, 
osteocalcin, and ALPL were analyzed in 2 control tissues 
(PC1, PC2) and 9 fi brous hamartoma tissues (FH1-FH9).

Th  e control tissues (periosteal cells) showed up-regulation 
of mRNA expression of col1a1, osteocalcin and ALPL 
in response to rhBMP-2 treatment. Col1a1 mRNA level 
increased by 1.65- or 1.94-fold, osteocalcin by more than 
2.0-fold, and ALPL by more than 3.0-fold. However, the 
response of fi brous hamartoma remained inconsistent. In 
7 of 9 FH’s, the mRNA expression of col1a1 increased by 
more than 10% of non-treatment control, while in 2 FH’s, 
it increased by 10% or decreased by 21%, respectively (Fig. 
2A). Osteocalcin mRNA expression was up-regulated by 
rhBMP in fewer FH’s than col1a1. Only 2 FH’s showed 
up-regulation of osteocalcin gene expression, and 6 FH’s 
showed down-regulation of osteocalcin gene expression 
by rhBMP2 treatment (Fig. 2B). ALP gene expression was 
down-regulated by rhBPM2 treatment in 7 FH’s, and that 
of the remaining 2 FH’s remained within 10% of that of 
untreated control. Th  is was in contrast to more than 3-fold 
up-regulation in the periosteal cells (PC1 and PC2) (Fig. 
2C).

Change in the mRNA Expression of Transcription 
Factors Involved in Osteoblastogenesis by BMP 
Treatment (Fig. 3) 
Transcription factors involved in osteoblastic diff erentia-
tion, such as Dlx5, Msx2, Runx2, and Osterix, were ana-
lyzed in 10 FH’s (FH1-FH8, FH10, FH11) and 2 periosteal 
cells. Periosteal cells showed responses compatible with 
osteoblastic differentiation. Dlx5, Runx2, and Osterix 
mRNA expressions were up-regulated with rhBMP2 treat-
ment by 52%, 59, and 20%, respectively, and that of Msx2 
was down-regulated by 48%. In FH’s, changes in mRNA 
expression of these transcription factors were not consis-
tent. Dlx5 expression was up-regulated in all FH’s tested. 
Th  e extent of up-regulation was similar to or larger than 
the two periosteal cells in 9 of 10 FH’s tested. FH2 showed 
mild up-regulation, which was smaller than that of ei-
ther PC1 or PC3. Msx2 was down-regulated as periosteal 
cells in 9 of 10 FH’s tested. However, only one FH (FH10) 
showed down-regulation more than the PC’s. In 8 of 10 
FH’s tested, the extent of down-regulation of Msx2 mRNA 
expression was less than 20% of the untreated cells, while 
that of PC’s were more than 40%. One FH (FH4) even 
showed up-regulation of Msx2 expression. Runx2 mRNA 

expression was up-regulated in 8 FH’s, and down-regulat-
ed in 2 FH’s. FH8 showed 8.7-fold up-regulation, which 
also showed the largest up-regulation of Dlx5 expression. 
However, FH8 showed down-regulation of osteocalcin and 
ALPL mRNA expression. Osterix mRNA expression was 
diverse. Two HF’s showed up-regulation larger than PC1, 
while three showed down-regulation by rhBMP2 treat-
ment.

DISCUSSION

This study was limited by the fact that mRNA expres-
sions of fibrous hamartoma from CPT associated with 
NF1 were compared to that of periosteal cells from non-
NF1 patients. The findings might reflect the difference 
between Nf1 haploinsufficient cells and wild-type cells, 
but it does not explain why fi brous hamartoma develops 
on distal tibia specifi cally in systemically Nf1 haploinsuf-
fi cient individual. In order to address this question, fi brous 
hamartoma cells should be compared with periosteal cells 
from normal-looking contralateral distal tibia of the same 
patient. However, it would be unethical to harvest it only 
for research purpose.

was divided by that of BMP-untreated cell. BMP: bone morphogenetic protein, PC: periosteal cell, FH: fibrous hamartoma, Dlx: distal-less homeobox,

We investigated several aspects of the osteoblastic 
differentiation process in primary cultured cells from 
fi brous hamartoma believed to be the main pathologic tis-
sue in CPT associated with NF1. Although the data were 
not consistent throughout all cases investigated in this 
study, fibrous hamartoma cells showed deficient expres-
sion of the Wnt ligands which are important factors in the 
regulation of bone mass, postnatal bone formation and 
fracture healing process.18) When stimulated by rhBMP2 
treatment, most fibrous hamartoma cells up-regulated 
col1a1 expression. However, only a subset up-regulated 
osteocalcin expression, and all of them down-regulated 
ALP expression. These findings were consistent with a 
published report on a smaller number of cases.16)

Osteoblastogenesis is a complex process of cell 
differentiation from mesenchymal stem cell through os-
teoprogenitor and preosteoblast to osteoblast. Wnts and 
BMPs are the most important signal molecules that regu-

late this process. In this study, we investigated mRNA ex-
pression of the Wnt ligands (Wnt1 and Wnt3a), and their 
receptors of the canonical pathway (Lrp5 and β-catenin). 
Wnts are a large family of growth factors involved in a va-
riety of biological processes. Th  e canonical pathway of Wnt 
signal mediated through β-catenin/Lrp5 modulates most 
aspects of osteoblastic physiology, including proliferation, 
differentiation, bone matrix formation/mineralization 
and apoptosis.19) We showed that the mRNA expression of 
Wnt1 and Wnt3a, which are known to be involved in os-
teoblastogenesis, were signifi cantly low in fi brous hamar-
toma cells, although the receptors’ mRNA expression was 
comparable to control tissue. Th  is means that defi ciency of 
local Wnt ligands may contribute to disturbed osteoblastic 
diff erentiation in fi brous hamartoma in the pathogenesis 
of CPT. It appears worthwhile to further investigate Wnt 
signaling systematically in CPT associated with NF1.

In a previous study, BMP2, BMP4, BMPR1A, BM-

PR1B, and BMPR2 were reported to express in fibrous 
hamartoma of CPT.16) BMP signals induce receptor-
mediated signaling pathways involving Smads, and subse-
quently transcriptions factors specifi c for osteoblastic dif-
ferentiation. Runx 2 is the master osteogenic transcription 
factor, expresses in early skeletal development and persists 
through subsequent stages of bone formation.20,21) Dlx5 
is a bone inducing homeodomain transcription factor, 
expressed in the later stages of osteoblastic diff erentiation, 
which is considered to be an upstream regulator of Runx2 
and Osterix in the BMP-2 signaling pathway.22) Osterix is a 
zinc fi nger-containing transcription factor, specifi cally ex-
pressed in all developing bones, which is considered to act 
mainly during the terminal diff erentiation of osteoblasts.21) 
Msx2 is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila 
muscle segment homeobox gene, which appears to play a 
negative role in osteoblast diff erentiation, stimulating cell 
proliferation and suppressing osteogenic diff erentiation.21) 
Hence, BMP signaling appears to be transduced via Smads 
to Dlx5, and then to Runx2 for early diff erentiation, and 
to Osterix for terminal differentiation and Msx2 antago-
nizes these pathways. In our control tissue - the periosteal 
cells - up-regulated Dlx5, Runx2 and Osterix were seen in 
response to BMP stimulation, whereas Msx2 was down-
regulated. Hence, we attempted to delineate the response 
of these transcription factor expressions in fibrous ham-
artoma cells. It is noteworthy that both Dlx5 and Runx2 
responded in a way similar to the periosteal cells in most 

cases of fi brous hamartoma. On the other hand, Msx2 ex-
pression was not suppressed by BMP stimulation as much 
as in the periosteal cells in most cases of fibrous hamar-
toma. In addition, Osterix expression was down-regulated 
in 3 of 5 FH’s. Th  ese fi ndings suggest that impairment of 
osteoblastic differentiation in fibrous hamartoma is the 
terminal step of the differentiation cascade and interfer-
ence by Msx2 may work in this process. Another aspect 
of these fi ndings that we need to pay attention is that the 
behavior of FH’s varies from patient to patient.

In conclusion, the fi ndings in this study support the 
hypothesis that fi brous hamartoma originates from aber-
rant growth of Nf1 haploinsuffi  cient periosteal cells, which 
failed in terminal osteoblastic diff erentiation, arrested at a 
certain stage of this process. Th  is pathomechanism of CPT 
should be targeted in the development of novel therapeu-
tic biologic intervention.
