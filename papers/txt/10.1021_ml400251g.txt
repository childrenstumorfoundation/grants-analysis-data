ABSTRACT: Here, we describe the selection and optimization
of a chemical series active in both a full-length and a fragment-
based Huntington’s disease (HD) assay. Twenty-four thousand
small molecules were screened in a phenotypic HD assay,
identifying a series of compounds bearing a 3-hydroxy-3-
triﬂuoromethylpyrazole moiety as able to revert
the toxicity
induced by full-length mutant Htt by up to 50%. A chemical
exploration around the series led to the identiﬁcation of
compound 4f, which demonstrated to be active in a Htt171−
82Q rat primary striatal neuron assay and a PC12-Exon-1 based assay. This compound was selected for testing in R6/2 mice, in
which it was well-tolerated and showed a positive eﬀect on body weight and a positive trend in preventing ventricular volume
enlargment. These studies provide strong rationale for
testing the potential beneﬁts of 3-hydroxy-3-
triﬂuoromethylpyrazoles in treating HD.

still debating the role of

H untington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant

neurodegenerative brain disorder caused by a CAG
trinucleotide repeat expansion (>35 repeats), which encodes an
abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the N-terminal
part of a large protein called huntingtin (Htt).1 Mutant Htt is
subject to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes1 and to aberrant pre-
RNA splicing,2 which results in the generation of N-terminal
fragments containing the expanded polyQ.1 These fragments
are able to aggregate with themselves and other proteins and
form large nuclear and cytoplasmatic inclusions.3 Although the
scientiﬁc community is
these
aggregates, the aﬀected neurons suﬀer from many diﬀerent
dysfunctions altering the normal cell equilibrium and leading to
apoptotic or necrotic cell death.4 Among these dysfunctions,
reduced ATP levels, decreased Ca2+ uptake, oxidative stress,
excitotoxicity, altered transcription, and impaired autophagy are
reported as major pathogenic mechanisms.5 Taken together,
the pathophysiological picture of HD still remains very complex
and poorly understood,
lacking validated target proteins for
therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, despite signiﬁcant
research eﬀorts
in the last 20 years since the mutated
huntingtin gene was discovered,6 none of the drug discovery
programs aimed at tackling a single target or a single pathway
involved in the disease pathology has yet yielded a molecule
capable of interfering with disease progression.7

Current target-based drug discovery strategies for HD are of
limited use, and alternative approaches for which an a priori
knowledge of molecular targets is not necessary are desirable.
Toward this goal, several groups have developed phenotypic
strategies to identify small molecules to be further developed
into potential drug candidates (Figure 1).8 The antiaggregation

activity of
the Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (Rock1)
inhibitor Y-27632 1, identiﬁed in a HEK-293 cell system, was
subsequently demonstrated to be active in HD-relevant cell and
animal models.9 Compounds 2 and 3 were identiﬁed in cell
screenings respectively as selective enhancer of mutant Htt
clearance10 and active in a cell viability assay against HD-
induced neurodegeneration.11 Both compounds resulted also
active in follow-up animal models,
including mouse and
C.elegans models of HD.12,13

Our approach aimed at identifying a class of compounds
displaying activity in both full-length and Exon-1 mutant
huntingtin-based HD assays, thus enabling us to recapitulate
the animal models we planned to use for preclinical compound
proﬁling (R6/2, Exon-1 based) and the human version of the
disease. Although not exhaustive, we sought to build a paradigm
to maximize the chance for eﬀective translation of preclinical
results toward clinical trials (Figure 2).

Figure 2. General workﬂow.

An HTS method was developed in-house creating a stable
recombinant 293/T-Rex cell line generated with both a CRE-
luciferase (CRE-LUC) reporter gene and with the full-length
mutant Htt gene under control of an inducible CMV promoter;
it has been shown that mutated Htt sequesters the cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB) coactivator, CREB-
binding protein (CBP) through direct protein interactions,
which leads to decreased CREB-mediated transcription.14 In
addition to this, we planned to use another in vitro model of
HD based on Htt expression via LV infection on primary
striatal rat neurons as a secondary screening assay. This assay
relies on the incorporation of a Htt-derived sequence
expressing an N-terminal 171 aa fragment of mutant or wild-
type Htt (Htt171−82Q or Htt171−18Q, respectively; see
Supporting Information).15

For the HTS screening campaign we selected 24,000 small
organic molecules from the diverse Siena Biotech compound
collection. Among the most promising hit compounds, a small
set of molecules containing a fused 3-hydroxy-3-triﬂuorome-
thylpyrazole moiety, initially consisting of 4 compounds and
exempliﬁed by compound 4a, displayed an activity range
between 5.9 and 18 μM with fold increase (FI) values between
30% and 50% as a measure of eﬃciency of the compound to
restore the CREB-mediated transcriptional activity in cells
expressing mutant Htt. A set of nonfused analogues represented
by compound 5 proved inactive in the screening when tested
up to 50 μM, showing the selectivity of this speciﬁc chemotype
only when fused to a cyclic ring.

A major concern of this series was the presence of the
geminal 3-hydroxy-3-triﬂuoromethyl
functionality and its
stability to dehydration. Indeed, it is reported in the literature
that 2-aryl or 2-alkyl substituted 3-hydroxy-3-triﬂuoromethyl
hexahydroindazoles undergo dehydration in acidic conditions
to aﬀord the corresponding 3-triﬂuoromethyl tetrahydroinda-
zoles derivatives.16 After retest
from a new batch and a
preliminary stability test conducted at pH = 7.4 and pH = 3, the
2-acyl and 2-sulphonyl hexahydroindazoles conﬁrmed activity

and stability to dehydration (data not shown). We speculate
that in this particular assembly the carbonyl oxygen atom could
stabilize the 3-hydroxyl group on the pyrazole ring from
dehydration by an intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction
(see compound 4a in Figure 1).

In the optimization program, we opted for maintaining the
main structural features of the molecules in order to keep the
general pharmacophore shape and focused on the exploration
of three main points: (a) the carbocyclic ring, (b) the linker,
and (c) the R1 ring (see Figure 1).

Initial hit 4a showed acceptable solubility and permeability,
but a far too high metabolism rate in human and mouse. In an
to improve the overall proﬁle of 4a, mitigating its
eﬀort
metabolic stability and moving to a IP-free chemical space, we
decided to explore the insertion of diﬀerent heterocycle rings in
R1 position, and few analogues were synthesized (see Scheme
1). The presence of an heterocycle in R1 not only produced a

As shown in Scheme 1, the fused 3-hydroxy-3-triﬂuorome-

corresponding cyclic ketones 6. Various cyclic rings were
explored starting from commercially available cyclohexanone,
cycloheptanone, and 4-pyranone. Upon treatment with sodium
methoxide and ethyl
the
diketone 7 was isolated as the corresponding sodium salt, or as
a mixture in the keto−enol form. Cyclization of the diketone
with a substituted acylhydrazide or sulphonylhydrazide in the

improvements were detected with the insertion of a pyrane
ring, with compound 4n showing comparable cellular potency
to initial hit 4a. The best results in terms of potency and
eﬃciency were obtained with acyl derivatives 4f and sulphonyl
derivative 8b exibiting a 6-membered carbocyclic ring and a 5-
membered heterocycle in R1 position as the most favorable
combination with both linkers. Our phenotypic assay approach
has thus lead to the selection of a subseries of molecules that
showed FI and EC50 values feasible for further evaluation in the
primary rat striatal neuron secondary assay.

Compounds 4b, 4c, 4f, and 8b were tested at EPFL in
Lausanne at 1, 10, and 30 μM. In this primary rat striatal
neuron-based model, Htt171−18Q or Htt171−82Q expression
is driven by a tetracycline responsive element (TRE) promoter
(TRE-htt171−18Q/82Q) in a lentiviral expression vector,
producing a rapid polyQ-dependent pathology that leads to
formation of intracellular Htt inclusions starting at 1−2 weeks
and decreased expression of the neuronal marker NeuN (a
readout of viability) as early as 2 weeks after infection. All four
compounds were shown to signiﬁcantly improve NeuN counts
relative to vehicle (DMSO-treated) counterparts at 10 and 30
μM concentrations (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information).
Figure 3A shows the eﬀect on survival of compound 4f as
representative of the series. The eﬀect was not completely
speciﬁc, with an increased NeuN count also detectable in the
htt171−18Q expressing cells. Our deduction was that
the
potential target(s) of this series of compounds is involved in a
general cell viability pathway. To further build upon this result,
the cytoprotection of compound 4f was tested in a PC12 cell
model in which Exon-1 mut-Htt expression is under control of
a tetracycline (Tet-on) system.23 Again, the compound was able
to protect from doxycycline (Doxy)-induced cell death by
reducing LDH release, a readout of mortality (Figure 3B). In
this model no eﬀects of

the compound were evident

More generally, all compounds examined did not show any
toxicity on normal cells (or neurons) even for a long period of
treatment (results not shown). Potential oﬀ-target eﬀects of the
series were evaluated in an early representative, compound 4b,
which was tested in a CEREP panel. The CEREP express
screening was performed on 71 receptors and 62 enzymes in
which 4b was proﬁled at 20 μM concentration. Compound 4b
showed no signiﬁcant activity on any target (full list and result
values available in Supporting Information) providing us with
enough information and conﬁdence to consider the series
potentially free from most common oﬀ-target eﬀect and ready
to enter into animal studies.

Following the achievement of a proof of activity in a full-
length, an Exon-1-based and an N171-based HD cell model, it
was decided to progress investigation of the series in an in vivo
model of HD. Selection criteria were based on compounds with
the best achievable systemic exposure in the animal. Selected
compounds were progressed to PK experiments (see Table S1
in Supporting Information) to determine whether a suitable
candidate for animal model testing (R6/2 mice) could be
identiﬁed. All analyzed compounds showed very short half-lives
with no remaining compound detected at 24 h after
administration. The Sulphone derivative 8b showed a high
clearance in mouse and very low levels after PO administration,
while the carbonyl derivatives 4f and 4c showed medium to
optimum bioavailability values (see Table S1 in Supporting
Information). Compound 4f was selected as a lead compound
after a dose escalating PK and an MTD experiment in which it
showed suitable systemic exposure and tolerability properties in
mouse (data not shown) making it compatible with a chronic
administration protocol. Additional studies on 4f determined a
B/P ratio of 0.34, no hERG activity detected up to 100 μM
concentration, negative mini-Ames test, and no CYP inhibition
(3A4 TST > 30 μM; 3A4 NIF > 30 μM; 1A2 > 30 μM; 2D6 >
30 μM; 2C9 > 30 μM; 2C19 = 24.4 μM).

R6/2 mice were treated with 4f at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, PO,
QD at Psychogenics (Tarrytown, NY), starting from 4 weeks of
age. Eﬀects of compound treatment were assessed with a motor
test battery comprising open ﬁeld, grip strength, and rotarod.
Drug eﬀects were also evaluated on BW and followed-up with
survival assessment. Compound 4f showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the clinically relevant parameter of BW, counteracting the
characteristic decrease in BW at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg (see
Figure S3 in Supporting Information). No signiﬁcant eﬀects of
treatment were detected on motor tests or survival.

A small satellite group of animals was sacriﬁced at 12 weeks
treatment) to perform brain
of age (after 8 weeks of
morphological studies. Eﬀects of 4f was assessed on the
neuropathological hallmarks of brain atrophy and ventricular
enlargement, using both ex vivo MRI and histological measures.
The quantiﬁcation of EM48-positive nuclear Htt aggregates
were also analyzed by immuno-histochemistry. Results of
morphological studies (Figure 4) showed a severe enlargement
of cerebral ventricular in R6/2 animals as compared to the wild-
type strain (C57Bl6). Furthermore, compound 4f showed a
trend toward decreasing the size of the cerebral ventricles.
These results were also conﬁrmed by ex vivo MRI performed in
ﬁxed brain (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information).

In conclusion, we have identiﬁed a class of compounds active
in three diﬀerent HD cell assays comprising diﬀerent
phenotypes, readouts, and promoters of toxicity induced by

mutant Htt. Overall,
the class showed favorable ADME
properties and in particular compound 4f showed a good
proﬁle that was judged suitable for in vivo studies. Results of
R6/2 mouse testing showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect on body weight
and a positive trend in decreasing cerebral ventricle volume, but
no eﬀect on motor tests or survival. Although our compounds
showed good activity in various in vitro HD models, the
modest ﬁndings of a statistically positive BW response and a
trend in improving ventricular volume did not provide a
suﬃciently strong impetus for us to develop the compound
further. To fully understand the potential of this class of
compounds, additional
studies are warranted. A target
deconvolution strategy could be of particular help to under-
stand the potential of the newly identiﬁed series either by
improving potency/eﬃcacy or by identifying the target or
inferring the molecular pathway in which this class of molecules
is involved.24
