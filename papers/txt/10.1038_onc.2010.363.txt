Biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene occurs in the
majority of
schwannomas. This usually involves a
combination of a point mutation or multiexon deletion,
in conjunction with either a second point mutation or loss
of heterozygosity (LOH). We have performed DNA
sequence and dosage analysis of the NF2 gene in a panel
of 239 schwannoma tumours: 97 neuroﬁbromatosis type 2
(NF2)-related schwannomas, 104 sporadic vestibular
(VS) and 38 schwannomatosis-related
schwannomas
In total, we identiﬁed germline NF2

mutations in 86 out of 97 (89%) NF2 patients and a
second mutational event in 77 out of 97 (79%). LOH
was by far the most common form of second hit. A
combination of microsatellite analysis with either conven-
tional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or
multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA)
identiﬁed mitotic recombination (MR) as the cause of
LOH in 14 out of 72 (19%) total evaluable tumours.
Among sporadic VS, at least one NF2 mutation was
identiﬁed by sequence analysis or MLPA in 65 out of 98
(66%) tumours. LOH occurred in 54 out of 96 (56%)
evaluable tumours, but MR only accounted for 5 out of 77
(6%) tested. LOH was present in 28 out of 34 (82%)
schwannomatosis-related schwannomas. In all eight pa-
tients who had previously tested positive for a germline
SMARCB1 mutation, this involved loss of the whole, or
part of the long arm, of chromosome 22. In contrast, 5 out
of 22 (23%) tumours from patients with no germline
SMARCB1 mutation exhibited MR. High-resolution
Affymetrix SNP6 genotyping and copy number (CN)
analysis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used
to determine the chromosomal breakpoint locations in
tumours with MR. A range of unique recombination sites,
spanning approximately 11.4 Mb, were identiﬁed. This
study shows that MR is a mechanism of LOH in NF2 and
SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis-related schwanno-
mas, occurring less frequently in sporadic VS. We found
no evidence of MR in SMARCB1-positive schwannoma-

Introduction

the NF2 gene,

Schwannomas are benign peripheral nerve sheath
tumours that occur within the context of the tumour
suppressor syndromes, neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2)
and schwannomatosis. They also occur sporadically
within the general population. In most schwannoma
tumours,
located on chromosome
22q12.2,
is biallelically inactivated. In NF2 patients,
the ﬁrst mutation is frequently a constitutional point
mutation or a small deletion. This is followed by a
second somatic mutation in the tumour, which is either a
second point mutation, or, more commonly, by loss of
the wild-type allele. Mutation within the NF2 gene
promoter or hypermethylation of key CpG dinucleo-
tides within this region may be an additional mechanism
of inactivation (Kino et al., 2001). This region is not
routinely tested and may account for a proportion of
patients with unfound mutations. In schwannomas
occurring outside NF2 disease, NF2 mutations are only
found somatically, occurring in the tumour, but not in
the germline (MacCollin et al., 2003), suggesting that
other genes are involved in these cases.

The chromatin remodelling gene, SMARCB1, located
approximately 6 Mb upstream of NF2 at 22q11.23,
was recently found to be mutated in germline DNA
in approximately 50% of
familial schwannomatosis
patients, and, less commonly, in sporadic schwannoma-
tosis (5–10%) (Hulsebos et al., 2007; Boyd et al., 2008;
Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Sestini et al., 2008). Our previous

study has
mutations are frequently associated with a somatic
NF2 mutation in tumours (Boyd et al., 2008; Hadﬁeld
et al., 2008), and a multihit hypothesis has been
involving both of these loci (Boyd et al.,
suggested,
2008; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Sestini et al., 2008).

shown that

The region 22q11 contains several low copy repeat
domains, and is known to be a particularly unstable
region of the genome (Dunham et al., 1999; Edelmann
et al., 1999). Recombination events in this region are
known to be involved in several diseases, occurring
both constitutionally (for example, cat eye syndrome,
velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome) and
somatically (for example, chronic myelogenous leukae-
mia Burkitt’s lymphoma, Ewing’s sarcoma) (Kaplan
et al., 1987).

Mitotic recombination (MR) is known to be an
important mutational mechanism in neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 and other tumour syndromes. Loss of hetero-
zygosity (LOH) of 17q is a common somatic hit in
neuroﬁbromas lacking a germline microdeletion muta-
tion, and is frequently the result of MR (Serra et al.,
2001; De Raedt et al., 2006). As LOH is also a common
event in tumours of patients with NF2, as well as with
sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VS) and schwanno-
matosis, and chromosome 22 is prone to a variety of
recombinational events, we analysed a panel of tumours
from each of these groups to determine rates of LOH
and MR with respect to the diagnosis and to the
initial genetic event. The Genome-Wide Human SNP
Array 6.0 (Affymetrix) platform was used to conﬁrm the
results and reﬁne identiﬁed breakpoints, as the combi-
nation of high density of small-nucleotide polymorph-
ism (SNP) genotyping and high density copy number
(CN) probes provides a more accurate and sensitive way
to determine both CN and homozygosity than do
conventional methods.

Results

Mutation spectrum of NF2, sporadic VS and
schwannomatosis tumours
We have performed DNA sequence and dosage analysis
of the NF2 gene in a panel of 239 schwannoma tumours:
97 tumours from 97 patients with NF2, 104 sporadic VS
and 38 tumours from 34 patients with schwannomatosis
(Table 1). We identiﬁed germline mutations in NF2 in
89% (86 out of 97) of NF2 patients. Out of these, 70
were found by direct sequence analysis and consisted
predominantly of nonsense mutations (36%) and frame-
shift mutations (21%). The remainder consisted of splice
mutations (13%), a single missense mutation and an
in-frame deletion of a single amino acid. In all, 16
additional
tumours harboured single or multiexon
deletions found by multiplex ligation-dependent probe
ampliﬁcation (MLPA). A second mutational event was
found in 77 (79%). This was a second point mutation in
13, MLPA deletion of a part of NF2 in 2 and LOH in 62.
MR was the cause of LOH in 14 out of 41 evaluable
tumours. Excluding tumours with LOH, but not tested
for MR, this leads to an overall rate of 14 out of 72
(19%). Analysis was not possible in some tumours,
because of insufﬁcient DNA or because of poor quality
of some DNA samples extracted from parafﬁn blocks.
In total, 7 of 15 NF2 patients with large multiexon

deletions had LOH as the mechanism of second hit
(including 3 with 46 exons deleted), although this did
not occur in the two patients with whole-gene deletions.
MR was not found to be the cause of LOH in any of
these tumours.

Of the 41 NF2 patients tested for MR, 27 were
mosaic, 13 were non-mosaic and 1 was uncertain. MR
was the cause of LOH in seven of the non-mosaic
patients (age range: 7–40 years; average: 23 years). These
seven patients developed a total of 191 spinal and
peripheral nerve schwannomas, with an average of 27
tumours per person. Sixteen non-mosaic NF2 patients
with no evidence of MR, including those with no LOH
(age range: 9–57 years; average: 32 years), had a total of
113 schwannomas, with an average of seven tumours per
person. This may suggest that the MR mechanism
functions as a modiﬁer for NF2, leading to a more
severe schwannoma phenotype, although the difference
in tumour burden did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
by the two-tailed t-test (P¼ 0.129). Furthermore, 5 out
of 7 MR patients had an underlying truncating
(nonsense/frameshift) mutation, compared with only 5
out of 16 non-mosaic patients. Out of the 27 mosaic
patients, seven (six out of seven not identiﬁable in
blood) showed MR and, strikingly, all seven developed
spinal and/or peripheral nerve schwannomas (three out
of seven aged o20 years); one as young as 10 years of
age, despite the mutation being undetectable in the
lymphocyte DNA. Of 21 mosaic patients without
evidence of MR (16 out of 21 not identiﬁable in blood),
only three developed a spinal or peripheral nerve
schwannoma o20 years and ﬁve had no evidence of
either spinal or cutaneous schwannomas. There was no
evidence that these effects were primarily due to the
underlying mutation: 6 out of 7 mosaic MR patients and
16 out of 21 mosaic non-MR patients had the more
severe truncating mutations.

Among sporadic VS, we identiﬁed at least one point
mutation in the NF2 gene in 65 out of 98 (66%)
tumours, with a higher incidence of frameshift (34%)
than nonsense mutations (17%) in comparison with
NF2-related tumours. Splice mutations (10%) and
missense mutations (1%) occurred in similar propor-
tions to NF2 tumours. MLPA identiﬁed a single exon-
11 deletion. LOH occurred in 54 out of 96 (56%), but
MR only accounted for 5 out of 35 evaluable tumours,
with an overall rate of 5 out of 7 (6%). The difference
between MR rates
in evaluable tumours between

(P-value¼ 0.0161)
if we extrapolate our results to
calculate the predicted overall number of tumours in
each group by ﬁrst extrapolating the predicted propor-
tion of LOH hits in the total number of tumours and
then extrapolating the proportion of LOH hits due to
MR. This suggests that 22 out of 97 NF2 tumours and 8
out of 104 sporadic VS have been caused by MR in our
cohort. This proportion is also signiﬁcant by w2-test,
adjusting for the lower rate of LOH, in addition to MR
in sporadic VS (P¼ 0.010).

As expected, no germline NF2 mutations were found
in any schwannomatosis patients. However, germline

SMARCB1 mutations were found in eight patients (six
from three different families and two sporadic patients)
and somatic NF2 point mutations were found in 24
tumours (Hadﬁeld et al., 2008). The proportions of NF2
frameshift mutations (37%) and splice mutations (11%)
were similar to those found in sporadic VS, but with
fewer nonsense mutations (5%) and a greater number of
missense (8%) mutations.

LOH was present in 28 out of 38 (74%) schwanno-
matosis-related schwannomas. In all eight tumours from
schwannomatosis patients who tested positive for a
germline SMARCB1 mutation, this involved loss of the
whole chromosome 22 or part of the long arm. In
contrast, 5 out of 22 (23%) evaluable tumours from
19 patients who had tested negative for SMARCB1
mutations exhibited MR.

Determination of mitotic recombination breakpoints
To investigate the potential mechanisms leading to MR,
we sought to deﬁne a critical region of recombination

on chromosome 22q, relevant to the pathogenesis of
schwannomas. We used Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays to
identify recombination breakpoints in a subset of
tumour samples that were previously found to have
undergone MR by a combination of dosage and
heterozygosity analysis, consisting of either conven-
tional CGH and microsatellite analysis or MLPA and
microsatellite analysis. Genomic DNA was available
for analysis from seven NF2-related schwannomas, one
sporadic VS and two SMARCB1 mutation-negative
schwannomatosis-related schwannomas, along with
their respective matched blood DNAs.

The data conﬁrmed that MR was unique to chromo-
some 22 in each sample, as all other chromosomes
showed normal CN and comparable heterozygosity in
blood and tumour. We determined the breakpoint
locations on chromosome 22q in six tumours obtained
from ﬁve patients with NF2, one sporadic VS and two
SMARCB1 mutation-negative schwannomatosis-related
schwannomas (Table 2). Examples of the SNP array
results are shown in Figure 1.

NF2 tumours showed a range of unique breakpoints
from 16 615 305 (SNP ID: rs181408) to 28 018 632 (SNP
ID: rs3761426) on chromosome 22 (Figure 2a). Two
tumours from the same patient (5i and 5ii) showed
relatively close, but non-identical breakpoints, approxi-
mately 350 000 bases apart. For one further NF2-related
sample, the combined genotyping and CN data analysis
determined that the LOH previously identiﬁed as MR
by a combination of microsatellite analysis and conven-
tional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was in
fact due to loss of genetic material.

A breakpoint was determined in a single sporadic VS

after 16 754 150 (SNP ID: rs2075453).

Recombination breakpoints were determined for both
SMARCB1 mutation-negative sporadic schwannomato-
sis tumours tested. Interestingly, the breakpoint in one
of
these tumours occurred at 23 283 227 (SNP ID:
rs2298386), which is downstream of the SMARCB1

Discussion

We have found that mitotic recombination events are
responsible for the LOH found in a proportion of
schwannoma tumours. These events are particularly
important for SMARCB1 mutation-negative schwanno-
matosis and NF2-related tumours, in which 23 and 19%
of evaluable tumours tested positive for MR, respec-
tively. A lower proportion of patients with sporadic VS
also seem to be susceptible to MR (6%). However,
although all
schwannomatosis patients who tested
positive for a germline SMARCB1 mutation also
harboured LOH in their tumour, none of this loss was due
to an MR event, suggesting that tumours from this group of
patients develop through an alternative mechanism.

We used high-density SNP analysis to reﬁne the
breakpoints and identify any common regions of
recombination in 10 tumours. This method provides
much more information than the combination of
microsatellite analysis and conventional CGH or MLPA
used previously. In this study, one NF2 tumour,
originally identiﬁed with somatic LOH caused by MR,
was shown to be due to loss of one chromosome 22. One
reason for a false-positive result in the original analysis
is the mixed population of normal and tumour cell DNA
in some tumour samples, which is more difﬁcult to

identify by conventional methods. In the nine remaining
tumours, MR was conﬁrmed as the cause of LOH.

The low copy repeat (LCR22) domains within the
22q11.2 region are distributed across an approximately
6.3 Mb region. The constitutional breakpoints respon-
sible for deletions in the velocardiofacial syndrome only
tend to occur within three of these (Edelmann et al.,
1999), whereas the somatic translocation events that
occur in chronic myelogenous leukaemia are found in
the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene, in a separate
low copy repeat domain. In our study, seven of the nine
approximate breakpoints that we were able to determine
were distributed across region 22q11.2. However, each
breakpoint was unique and found outside of the LCR22
sequences (Figure 2b). The distribution of breakpoints
showed no particular clustering and in each case the
recombinant region extended from the breakpoint to
the chromosome terminus, suggesting an alternative
trigger
recombination. The two
remaining recombination breakpoints occurred outside
of the q11.2 region,
in q12.1 (patient 1) and q12.2
(patient 4). Both of these were from NF2 patients and
occurred upstream of the NF2 gene.

type of

for

this

Four schwannomas from our panel (from patients 1,
2, 4 and 7) harboured a recombination breakpoint
between the SMARCB1 and NF2 loci (Figure 2a). One
of these was a SMARCB1 mutation-negative schwan-
nomatosis-related tumour. The breakpoint
for this
tumour causes disruption of the NF2 gene by effecting
homozygosity of a somatic mutation identiﬁed in
the tumour, but may also have a positional effect on
the SMARCB1 gene, despite occurring downstream of
this locus.

Interestingly, none of

the LOH in SMARCB1
mutation-positive schwannomas was due to MR. It is
possible that the initiating genetic event may inﬂuence
the type of second hit that occurs in the tumour, as has
been suggested for the difference in occurrence of LOH
in neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 neuroﬁbromas with and
without germline microdeletions (De Raedt et al., 2006).
In our cohort of NF2 patients, the most common
sequence of mutation events was a constitutional point
mutation, followed by a somatic LOH event, whereas
the two patients with whole-gene deletions as a ﬁrst hit
had a point mutation as the second hit.

In SMARCB1-positive schwannomatosis, the initiat-
ing event is a germline SMARCB1 mutation with the
second proposed event being an LOH deletion of 22q
that removes the wild-type SMARCB1 and an allelic
copy of NF2 (Hulsebos et al., 2007; Boyd et al., 2008;
Hadﬁeld et al., 2008; Sestini et al., 2008). The third hit
would be an NF2 mutation on the remaining ipsilateral
allele to the germline SMARCB1 mutation. MR would
not have a role in this
three-hit hypothesis, as
reduplication of the mutant allele would only be possible
if the ipsilateral NF2 mutation occurred second. It is
possible that loss of SMARCB1 and a dosage loss of
half of NF2 would cause schwann cell proliferation, thus
driving the third mutation.

expression (Kino et al., 2001) and has been suggested as
a mechanism for progression to growth of VS (Gonza-
lez-Gomez et al., 2003). It is possible that increased rates
of aberrant methylation in sporadic VS may account for
the reduced detection rate of NF2 point mutations in
sporadic VS in comparison with NF2 tumours. As a
reduction in the levels of methylation has also been
proposed as a mechanism of increased occurrence of
genomic recombination events (Carbone et al., 2009), it
is also possible that an increased incidence of methyla-
tion in certain tumours would reduce the likelihood of
MR involvement. Further work is necessary to test this
hypothesis.

A number of patients have shown MR in more than
one tumour and there seems to be a trend towards an
increased schwannoma formation in those patients who
develop schwannomas by this mechanism. We were
unable to demonstrate a formal statistical signiﬁcance
for this, but it remains possible that some individuals
with non-mosaic NF2 or SMARCB1-negative schwan-
nomatosis and an increased susceptibility to MR have a
higher risk of increased tumour burden.

In summary, our study demonstrates a role for
mitotic recombination events in the development of a
proportion of schwannoma tumours and shows that the
rates of MR vary, depending on the disease context. The
lack of SMARCB1 mutations in schwannomatosis-
related schwannomas with MR suggests that there are
additional genetic causes of schwannomatosis, one of
which may involve an increased susceptibility to mitotic
recombination. Further studies will be required to
determine the speciﬁc combination of genetic events
that initiates tumour growth

High-resolution genotyping and CN analysis
Matched blood and tumour samples for each patient were
genotyped using the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0
(Affymetrix). Genomic DNA was puriﬁed by ethanol pre-
cipitation and 500 ng was hybridized to an SNP6 chip
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This array
contains a total of B1.8 million probes, comprised of
906 600 SNP probes and 946 000 CN probes spaced throughout

the genome. Staining of the array was carried out on a Fluidics
Station 450 (Affymetrix) and the array was scanned using the
GeneChip scanner 3000 7G system (Affymetrix).

Data analysis
The CN data were generated using the BRLMM-P-Plus
algorithm from Affymetrix using reference model ﬁles
generated from a pool of 56 unaffected genomic DNA control
samples. Genotype and CN analysis were carried out using the
Genotyping Console 3.0.2 (Affymetrix). The genotyping no-
call threshold was set to 0.01 and the CN/LOH detection
threshold was set to 0.02. Mitotic recombination was demon-
strated by tumour-speciﬁc, incomplete loss of heterozygosity,
with no change in CN throughout the homozygous region. In
tumour samples containing a heterogeneous population of
normal and tumour cell DNA, regions of MR appeared as
dual tracks of SNP calls on allele difference plots and were not
called as LOH by the Genotyping Console. However, the copy
number remained at 2, whereas heterozygous base calls were
