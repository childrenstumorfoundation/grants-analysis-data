Axonal surface proteins encompass a group of heterogeneous molecules, which exert a variety of different functions in the
highly interdependent relationship between axons and Schwann cells. We recently revealed that the tumour suppressor protein
merlin, mutated in the hereditary tumour syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type 2, impacts signiﬁcantly on axon structure mainten-
ance in the peripheral nervous system. We now report on a role of neuronal merlin in the regulation of the axonal surface
protein neuregulin 1 important for modulating Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. Speciﬁcally, neuregulin 1 type III
expression is reduced in sciatic nerve tissue of neuron-speciﬁc knockout animals as well as in biopsies from seven patients with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 2. In vitro experiments performed on both the P19 neuronal cell line and primary dorsal root ganglion
cells demonstrate the inﬂuence of merlin on neuregulin 1 type III expression. Moreover, expression of ERBB2, a Schwann
cell receptor for neuregulin 1 ligands is increased in nerve tissue of both neuron-speciﬁc merlin knockout animals and
patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that axonal merlin indirectly regulates Schwann
cell behaviour. Collectively, we have identiﬁed that neuronally expressed merlin can inﬂuence Schwann cell activity in a
cell-extrinsic manner.

Axonal merlin regulates neuregulin 1 type III expression

Brain 2014: 137; 420–432 | 421

Introduction

The development and lifelong integrity of myelinated peripheral
nerves rely on the co-ordinated, reciprocal communication be-
tween axons and Schwann cells. In addition to intrinsic factors
that modify the properties of myelin-producing Schwann cells,
several extrinsic regulators of myelination derived from axons
have been described. Axons provide signalling cues to Schwann
cells
inﬂuencing proliferation, differentiation and survival of
Schwann cells during development as well as in the adult ensuring
the lifelong maintenance and preservation of a functional nerve
(Michailov et al., 2004; Taveggia et al., 2005).

One of the best characterized signalling cascades between axons
and Schwann cells is the neuregulin 1 (NRG1)–ERBB2/3 pathway,
interference of which results in Schwann cell defects leading to
degeneration of motor and sensory neurons
(Corfas et al.,
2004). The NRG1 growth factor-like family exists in various iso-
forms due to alternative splicing (Kerber et al., 2003). NRG1 type I
and II are shed by axons, acting as paracrine signals, whereas type
III is cleaved but remains tethered to the axon surface, acting as a
juxtacrine signal (Nave and Salzer, 2006). All of these axon-derived
NRG1 family members inﬂuence multiple and distinct phases of
Schwann cell development by binding and signalling through the
ERBB2/3 receptor tyrosine kinases on Schwann cells (Morrissey
et al., 1995; Vartanian et al., 1997; Rahmatullah et al., 1998).

NRG1 type III is a key instructive signal for Schwann cell mye-
lination through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt activity
downstream of the ERBB2/3 receptor (Taveggia et al., 2005).
Moreover, the expression levels of NRG1 type III are thought to
determine the myelination fate of axons (Quintes et al., 2010).
Large calibre axons will only be myelinated when expressing high
levels of NRG1 type III compared with the low levels found on small
calibre ﬁbres that are organized in Remak bundles. Forced expres-
sion of NRG1 type III in normally non-myelinated ﬁbres results in
ectopic myelination (Taveggia et al., 2005), whereas reductions in
NRG1 type III result in signiﬁcant hypomyelination. These ﬁndings
indicate that Schwann cells can sense and then decide to myelinate
dependent on the amount of NRG1 type III presented to them.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant in-
herited syndrome characterized by mutations in the gene coding
for the tumour suppressor merlin located on chromosome 22q
11.2. Patients with NF2 typically develop tumours of the PNS
and CNS (Baser et al., 2003). A diagnostic hallmark of NF2 is
bilateral schwannomas of the vestibular nerve. Some patients
with NF2 additionally suffer from severe generalized peripheral
polyneuropathy, which does not correlate with tumour burden
(Hagel et al., 2002). As a possible cause for a non-tumorigenic
aetiology of the polyneuropathy, recent studies have revealed that
merlin expressed in neurons is capable of regulating different steps
of neuromorphogenesis through small GTPase activity control
(Schulz et al., 2010). Furthermore, merlin in PNS neurons has
been shown to impact on axon structure maintenance through
neuroﬁlament phosphorylation in an axon-intrinsic manner
(Schulz et al., 2013). Speciﬁcally, the loss of one merlin splice
variant, namely merlin isoform 2, results in both irregular-shaped
PNS axons and altered ultrastructural neuroﬁlament composition,

leading to neuropathic symptoms in a merlin-mutant mouse
model. These ﬁndings indicate that
reduced gene dosage of
merlin in neurons contributes to the pathogenesis of NF2-related
polyneuropathy
absence of nerve-damaging
schwannomas.

even in the

Axonal pathologies have been shown to precede demyelination
or cause secondary Schwann cell effects (Vavlitou et al., 2010).
We therefore hypothesized that the reduction of neuronal merlin
resulting in axonal atrophy may also affect the crosstalk between
axons and Schwann cells. Using merlin-mutant mouse models, we
therefore investigated whether any Schwann cell changes could be
detected in vivo. Moreover, because it has been proposed that,
dependent on the axonal dimension, neurons regulate NRG1 type
III expression (Michailov et al., 2004), we further examined if the
expression of this axonal membrane-associated growth factor is
altered, possibly leading to aberrant NRG1–ERBB2/3 signalling be-
tween axons and Schwann cells. Such a deregulation of axonally-
derived Schwann cell fate determinants could mechanistically play
a role in the development of neuropathies. Furthermore, Schwann
cell detachment from axons may constitute an important early
event for Schwann cell-derived tumours observed in NF2 (Miller
et al., 2003).

Materials and methods

Experimental animals

All mice used in this study were handled in strict adherence to local
governmental and institutional animal care regulations. Animals had
free access to food and water and were housed under constant tem-
perature and humidity conditions on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. The
following transgenic mouse strains were used for the study: Nf2 iso1
knockout and Nf2 iso2 knockout mice, generated by Dr. Michiko Niwa-
Kawakita and Dr. Marco Giovannini, were purchased from RIKEN
BioResource Centre. Nf2ﬂox animals (RIKEN BioResource Centre) were
used to obtain conditional, Schwann cell-speciﬁc merlin knockout by
crossing with the P0-Cre line (The Jackson Laboratory, stock 017928).
To achieve neuron-speciﬁc loss of merlin in vivo, we mated Nf2ﬂox
animals with a mouse strain that expresses Cre recombinase under the
neuroﬁlament heavy class promoter (Nefh-Cre) (The Jackson Laboratory,
stock 009102). Offspring of Nf2ﬂox and Stra8-Cre animals were used to
produce Nf2/ﬂ mice. The Stra8-Cre mouse line deletes the targeted
gene—in this case the Nf2 gene—in germ cells of males, thus resulting
in the same gene disruption in all progeny.

All animals were on a C57BL/6 background. The day of birth, on
average the 19th day of pregnancy, was deﬁned as post-natal Day 0.
Tissue was taken from 8-week-old, adult mice unless stated otherwise.
Genotyping was performed according to the recommendations of the
manufacturer or depositor, respectively.

Sural nerve biopsies from patients with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 2

Nine sural nerve biopsies from seven patients with NF2 were investi-
gated. The patients that met the NIH criteria for NF2 (Gutmann et al.,
1997) and were diagnosed according to the Manchester criteria (Baser
et al., 2003), were included in this study. Informed consent was ob-
tained from all patients. Clinical characteristics of the patients, including

age at operation, gender and severity of disease, were obtained by
review of the medical records. Neurological examination was performed
in all patients and electrophysiological examination was conducted in
patients with suspected polyneuropathy. Metabolic, inﬂammatory, toxic
or genetic reasons other than NF2 were excluded as a reason for poly-
neuropathy by medical history and examination of blood and CSF
(Hagel et al., 2002). The cohort comprised ﬁve male and two female
patients; the mean age of patients at operation was 44  11.6 years.
As controls, 12 sural nerve specimens with normal histomorphology
were selected (mean age 55  11.96 years, male:female = 9:3).
Further, to study possible changes in NRG1 expression in other patho-
logical conditions, 10 samples with chronic inﬂammatory demyelinat-
ing polyneuropathy and nine samples with non-inﬂammatory chronic
axonopathy were investigated (mean age 66  12.87 years for pa-
tients with chronic
inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,
male:female = 3:7; 58  14.45 years for patients with axonopathy,
male:female = 8:1).

Histopathology and
immunohistochemistry of sural nerve
biopsies

All sural nerve specimens were primarily diagnosed in the Institute of
Neuropathology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, by
two neuropathologists. For routine diagnostics, formalin-ﬁxed and par-
afﬁn-embedded material was stained with haematoxylin and eosin,
periodic acid-Schiff, Elastica van Gieson, Masson-Goldner, Turnbull,
Congo red, thioﬂavin-S and Bodian’s stains. Semi-thin sections of the
NF2 sural nerves were stained with toluidine blue. In addition, the
samples were labelled with antibodies against neuroﬁlament, S-100 pro-
tein, leukocyte common antigen, CD79a, CD45R0, HLA-DR/DP/DQ,
CD68, CD4, CD8, CD20, Ki-67 and epithelial membrane antigen.

For the present investigation, the NF2 samples, controls, chronic
inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and axonopathy cases
were double-labelled immunohistochemically with antibodies against
neuroﬁlament and myelin protein zero, NRG1 and myelin protein
zero or single labelled with antibodies against ERBB2. Specimens of
breast cancer metastases previously found to express ERBB2 served as
a positive control for labelling with ERBB2 antibodies (Maguire and
Greene, 1990). As a second positive control, sural nerve biopsies
with severe vasculitic changes were selected (Massa et al., 2006).
The sciatic nerves from four mice were single-labelled with antibodies
against neuroﬁlament, NRG1 and ERBB2.

All slides were coated with poly-L-lysine (10%, Sigma Aldrich, #P8920)
for improved adhesion of the sections. Staining of human tissue took
place in an automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems) using a stand-
ard antigen retrieval protocol (CC1). The specimens were double-labelled
with antibodies against neuroﬁlament (1:800, DakoCytomation) and
myelin protein zero (1:300, Bioss Antibodies) or NRG1 (1:200, Acris
Antibodies) and myelin protein zero and single-labelled against ERBB2
(1:100, DakoCytomation). Bound neuroﬁlament-, NRG1- and ERBB2-
antibodies were detected by the peroxidase method using diaminobenzi-
dine as chromogen (Ventana Medical Systems), whereas myelin protein
zero was demonstrated using the alkaline phosphatase method and fast
red as chromogen (Ventana Medical Systems). All slides were counter-
stained with alum-haematoxylin.

Immunohistochemistry of mouse nerve specimens was performed in
a similar way for neuroﬁlament, whereas NRG1 and ERBB2 labelling
was conducted using Shandon cover plate immunostaining chambers
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Tissue was processed and sectioned similarly to
human samples. After

peroxidase with 0.3% H2O2 for 15 min, the slides were boiled in a
microwave oven for 60 min at 640 W in 10% citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for antigen retrieval. NRG1 (1:100) and ERBB2 antibodies (1:50) were
applied overnight at 5C. Ventana Medical Systems’ kit (see above)
was applied as secondary antibody for 90 min at 5C. Bound second-
ary antibodies were visualized with diaminobenzidine. Slides were
counterstained with Mayer’s haemalum (1:1, Merck) for 30 s.

Evaluation of stainings

Two out of nine sural nerve biopsies of patients with NF2 were devoid
of axons and so were excluded from the present study. Double-labelled
sections were evaluated quantitatively by calculating the percentage of
nerve ﬁbres positive for NRG1 and myelin protein zero against all
myelin protein zero-positive ﬁbres in the same fascicle. To ensure
that all myelin protein zero-positive myelin sheaths contained an
axon, NRG1/myelin protein zero labelling was compared with samples
double-labelled with myelin protein zero and neuroﬁlament antibodies.
ERBB2-labelled sections were assessed in a similar way by calculating
the percentage of ERBB2-positive ﬁbres in relation to all ﬁbres in the
same fascicle analysed for neuroﬁlament and NRG1 expression.

Single-stained mouse nerve sections were evaluated quantitatively in
three fascicles. Each fascicle was photographed and the images were
combined using AxioVision Software V4.6.2. Myelinated nerve ﬁbres
were marked with red or green dots in the images to denote NRG-
positive (strong or moderate labelling) or NRG-negative (no or slight
labelling), respectively. The dots were counted with AxioVision and
related to the total area of the fascicle to obtain the ﬁbre density.
Fibre densities of NRG-positive and NRG-negative ﬁbres were
summed to attain the total ﬁbre density. Finally, the percentages of
NRG-positive ﬁbres were calculated by dividing the density of NRG-
positive ﬁbres by the density of all ﬁbres and multiplying by 100.
ERBB2-labelled sections were analysed as described above.

analysis software by ImageJ. Density values were normalized to actin
and appropriate controls of transfection or wild-type tissue, respect-
ively. In case of phospho-speciﬁc detection of proteins, their acquired
densities were referred to signals derived from related pan-antibodies
(e.g. phospho-Akt to Akt signals).

P19 cell culture

P19 cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-1825) and maintained in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% foetal
calf serum. For induction of a neuronal phenotype, aggregates were
generated on bacterial-grade dishes and treated with 5  10
  7 M all-
trans retinoic acid (Sigma Aldrich) for 4 days. Subsequently, cells were
replated on dishes of cell culture grade in the absence of retinoic acid.

Site-directed mutagenesis
QuikChangeÕ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions to generate C-terminal
merlin point mutation carrying mutants Q324L, K413E and L535P.

Dorsal root ganglion culture

Preparation of dorsal root ganglion cells from 4- to 6-day-old mice
(P4–P6) was performed as described in Malin et al.
(2007).
Arabinofuranosyl cytidine (working concentration of 10 mM, Sigma
Aldrich) was used to ensure glia-free conditions.

Transfection procedure

P19 and primary dorsal root ganglion cells were transfected 3–4 days
after plating using LipofectamineÕ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Transfection efﬁciency averaged between 40
and 50%.

Immunocytochemistry

Primary dorsal root ganglion cells were grown on coverslips and ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing in PBS,
cells were permeabilized with 0.3% TritonTM X-100 for 1 min and
incubated for 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, cells
were incubated with the primary antibodies at room temperature for
1 h. The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho neuroﬁlament

Analysis of myelination in merlin
knockout mice

Analysis of axon calibre and myelination was conducted on semi-thin
and ultra-thin sections of the sciatic nerve removed from transcardially
perfused mice. Mice were perfused with a solution containing 3%
paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). Sections were postﬁxed for 1 h and kept in ﬁxative including
3% sucrose. Sections were obtained from the mid-part of the sciatic
nerve reaching from the gluteal to the popliteal regions. Sectioning
and staining were performed as described. Images of toluidine blue-
stained semi-thin sections were taken using an Axioskop 2 MOT (Carl
Zeiss) equipped with a 100 immersion oil objective and an Olympus
XC50 digital camera (Olympus). Standardized settings for camera sen-
sitivity, resolution (2576  1932 pixels) and brightness of illumination
were used for all micrographs. Ultra-thin sections were analysed with
an electron microscope (EM910, Carl Zeiss) equipped with an inte-
grated TRS 1K digital camera (Carl Zeiss). Image analysis was con-
ducted with ImageJ version 1.43u. RGB colour images obtained from
semi-thin sections were split into single channels and the green chan-
nel was chosen for measurements. The image was contrasted using
the auto function. Using the freehand selection tool, the axon and the
myelin were grossly circumscribed and the area adapted using the
ABSnake plugin (the gradient threshold varied between 20 and 30,
10 to 20 iterations were used per image). Low contrasted myelin
sheaths were surrounded manually. Based on the measured areas,
the thicknesses of the axons and myelin sheaths were calculated.

Statistical evaluation

All statistics were performed using SPSS for Windows version 20.
Signiﬁcance levels were calculated using Student t-test or one-way
ANOVA. Multiple correlations between the variables were computed
using the Kendall tau-b test.

Microscopy and image acquisition

Fluorescent images of dissociated neurons were obtained with a Zeiss
Axio Imager ApoTome microscope (Zeiss). All digital processing of the
photomicrographs was performed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For all
images, only linear adjustments of the brightness and contrast were
performed.

NRG1 type III represented a reasonable candidate to study be-
cause it is thought to act as a biochemical sensor of axon calibre
(Michailov et al., 2004). The NRG1 type III full-length protein is
processed to its biologically active form (75 kDa) by proteolytic
cleavage (Velanac et al., 2012). Developmental analysis of
NRG1 isoforms revealed a clear correlation between the active

It has been previously suggested that—dependent on their
axonal diameter—neurons themselves can regulate NRG1 type
III expression (Michailov et al., 2004). We therefore expected
that only merlin isoform 2 (merlin-iso2) knockout mice, associated
with axon-intrinsic pathology (Schulz et al., 2013), would carry
altered NRG1 type III. Surprisingly, however, we found that
nerve lysates of both merlin isoform 1 (merlin-iso1)-deﬁcient ani-
mals and merlin-iso2-deﬁcient animals showed decreased levels of
NRG1 type III
integrity is
uncoupled from NRG1 type III regulation. The PI-3K/Akt signalling
pathway downstream of ERBB2/3 receptor has been shown to be
a key signalling event for myelination of Schwann cells (Taveggia
et al., 2005). As expected, lysates with reduced NRG1 type III also
carried reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt (p-Akt; Fig. 1A).
Another prominent axonal surface protein, Notch1, also appeared
to be decreased in sciatic nerve lysates following the loss of either
merlin isoform 1 or 2 (Fig. 1B).

Although NRG1 type III exclusively appears on axonal surfaces
as a juxtacrine signalling molecule, both Schwann cells and neu-
rons express NOTCH1 (Yoon and Gaiano, 2005; El Bejjani
and Hammarlund, 2012). To identify the cellular compartment
responsible for
the re-
spective axonal surface proteins, we used an established mouse
model mimicking NF2 disease where the Schwann cell-speciﬁc
promoter myelin protein zero (P0) conditionally deletes merlin in
Schwann cells (P0-Cre;Nf2ﬂox). The loss of merlin in Schwann
cells (P0-Cre;Nf2ﬂ/ﬂ) had no effect on NRG1 type III
levels
(Fig. 1C), whereas NOTCH1 expression was markedly reduced
(Fig. 1D) compared to wild-type littermates (P0-Cre;Nf2 + / + ).
These ﬁndings suggest that axonal NRG1 is not inﬂuenced by
the loss of merlin in Schwann cells. On the other hand, diminished
expression of NOTCH1 in the isoform-speciﬁc merlin knockout
nerve lysates (Fig. 1B) might be caused by merlin deﬁciency in
Schwann cells.

To further validate our observations, we conditionally deleted
merlin in the neuronal cell compartment using a mouse line that
expresses Cre recombinase under the neuron-speciﬁc promoter
Nefh (Nefh-Cre;Nf2ﬂox). The neuron-speciﬁc loss of merlin
(Nefh-Cre;Nf2ﬂ/ﬂ) resulted in a considerable reduction of NRG1
type III in sciatic nerve lysates when compared with wild-type
control mice (Nefh-Cre;Nf2 + / + ). This reduction in NRG1 type III
was again accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of Akt phos-
phorylation (Fig. 1E). Most strikingly, a comparable decline in
NRG1 type III expression also occurred in mice bearing heterozy-
gous loss of merlin in neurons (Nefh-Cre;Nf2ﬂ/ + ), indicating that

Figure 1 Loss of merlin in sciatic nerve lysates is accompanied
by decreasing NRG1 type III levels. (A–F) Immunoblots of sciatic
nerve lysates taken from adult mice. (A) Loss of each major
merlin isoform in transgenic animals (nf2 iso1 KO; nf2 iso2 KO)
results in decreased expression of NRG1 type III and reduced Akt
phosphorylation (p-Akt). Actin was used as loading control
(n = 3). (B) Loss of merlin-iso1 or merlin-iso2 in vivo leads to
reduced expression of NOTCH1 (n = 2). (C and D) Schwann
cell-speciﬁc loss of merlin (P0-Cre;Nf2ﬂ/ﬂ) has no effect on
NRG1 type III level but lowers NOTCH1 expression compared
with wild-type littermates (P0-Cre;Nf2 + / + ; n = 3). (E and F)
Neuron-speciﬁc merlin knockout (Nefh-Cre;Nf2ﬂoxﬂ/ﬂ) reduces
levels of NRG1 type III and p-Akt. NOTCH1 levels are un-
changed in sciatic nerves after loss of merlin in the neuronal
compartment (n = 2). (G) Isoform-speciﬁc loss of merlin reduces
NRG1 type III amounts in hind-brain lysates of adult mice
(n = 3). Blot quantiﬁcations (density values) are depicted below
respective lanes and are normalized to actin and wild-type
controls. KO = knockout.

reduction of merlin gene dosage to one allele is sufﬁcient to alter
NRG1 expression. Please note that the neuron-speciﬁc loss of
merlin is reﬂected only by a slight reduction in the overall merlin
protein level detected by western blot from sciatic nerve lysates
(Fig. 1E and F). This in turn suggests that the majority of the
merlin protein found in the lysates is of non-neuronal origin
(Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts etc.).

To further underscore the functional

importance of heterozy-
gous merlin mutations in vivo, we studied mice bearing only
the body (Nf2/ﬂ
one functional merlin allele in all cells of
described above), a condition that mimics NF2 germline mutations
where only one functional merlin allele remains. Loss of one func-
tional merlin allele was again sufﬁcient to detect reduced NRG1
type III levels (Nf2/ﬂ in Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, the
neuron-speciﬁc loss of merlin had no obvious effect on Notch1
expression in sciatic nerve lysates (Fig. 1F), conﬁrming that the
reduction of expression of Notch1 in complete isoform merlin
knockout nerve lysates (Fig. 1B) is caused by reduced expression
in Schwann cells.

In addition to lysates derived from PNS nerves, NRG1 type III
expression was also reduced in hind-brain lysates of merlin-
deﬁcient adult mice (Fig. 1G), indicating that merlin’s involvement
in NRG1 expression applies to both PNS and CNS neurons. The
expression of NRG1 types I and II, however, appeared mostly
unchanged after the loss of merlin. In conclusion, these results
indicate that the loss of both major merlin isoforms in the neuronal
compartment affects the expression of the axonal surface protein
NRG1 type III.

Hypermyelination in merlin knockout
animals

According to the literature, the NRG1 type III axonal signal con-
trols the ﬁne-tuning of myelin membrane growth. We therefore
expected that the observed reduction of NRG1 type III
levels
in vivo should result in hypomyelination (thinner myelin) during
development (Michailov et al., 2004). The g-ratio is a measure of
myelin thickness and is proportional to ﬁbre size (axon diameter/
myelinated ﬁbre diameter). We therefore analysed this typical
myelination parameter in sciatic nerve cross-sections from both
merlin-iso2- and merlin-iso1-deﬁcient animals
(Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. 3).

Surprisingly, visual

inspection of myelinated axons of both
merlin isoform-speciﬁc knockout animals did not show a drop in
myelination.
Instead, a slight but signiﬁcant increase in myelin
thickness could be observed (Fig. 2B, left panel). Consequently,
the g-ratio was decreased in both mouse strains (Fig. 2B, right
panel). The myelination of P0-Cre;Nf2ﬂox mice, where merlin is
speciﬁcally deleted in Schwann cells only,
instead appeared
decreased (Fig. 2C), resulting in a g-ratio gain because the axon
diameter was also statistically reduced (not shown).

Collectively, our data indicate a speciﬁc reduction in NRG1 type
III as well as a decrease in the signalling cascades downstream of
the ERBB2/3 receptor with loss of merlin isoform 1 or 2. However,
surprisingly we can detail the resulting Schwann cell phenotype is
hypermyelination rather than hypomyelination.

NRG1 expression following merlin
overexpression in vitro

To further test whether merlin can affect the levels of NRG1 type
III in vitro, we performed cell culture experiments with neuronally
differentiated P19 cells (Jones-Villeneuve et al., 1982) and primary
dorsal root ganglion cells. Overexpression of either full
length
merlin-iso1 or merlin-iso2 in P19 cells resulted in elevated protein
expression of NRG1 type III compared to vector control (Fig. 3A).
Moreover, we transfected FLAG-tagged merlin fragments into P19
cells to identify the protein domain important to this effect. We
found that the C-terminal fragments of both major merlin isoforms
predominantly increased NRG1 type III expression in P19 cells
whereas the N-terminus, which is shared by both major merlin
isoforms, showed no signiﬁcant effect (Fig. 3A). We additionally

tested whether known C-terminal merlin missense mutations
derived from patients with NF2 (Yang et al., 2011) (Q324L,
K413E and L535P) affected merlin’s ability to increase NRG1
type III levels in vitro. However, these NF2-derived point muta-
tions showed no alteration with respect to NRG1 type III expres-
sion when compared with wild-type merlin (Fig. 3B). Taken
together, these results verify that merlin can indeed modulate
NRG1 type III and that the C-terminus of both isoforms 1 and 2
are important for this regulation. In addition, we conclude that
complete loss of merlin or large truncations of merlin because of
nonsense or
frameshift mutations might have a functional
consequence.

As NRG1 protein expression can be regulated both at the tran-
(Velanac et al., 2012), we

scriptional and translational

level

examined whether merlin overexpression in P19 cells induces tran-
scriptional upregulation of Nrg1 messenger RNA levels. Using
Nrg1-speciﬁc primers amplifying a product within the EGF
domain, shared by Nrg1 types I, II and III (Kerber et al., 2003),
we found that Nrg1 messenger RNA expression appeared un-
changed following merlin overexpression (Fig. 3C). These ﬁndings
indicate that merlin does not regulate Nrg1 at the messenger RNA
level, but rather possibly inﬂuences its protein stability and/or
cleavage.

To further verify our ﬁnding we analysed the actions of merlin
in primary dorsal root ganglion cells. Overexpression of one major
merlin isoform in dorsal root ganglion cells consistently led to
increased NRG1 type III levels (Fig. 3D). In addition, immunostain-
ing of NRG1 with phosphorylated neuroﬁlaments as an axonal

marker in cultured dorsal root ganglion cells showed an expression
pattern clearly resembling an axonal surface molecule (Fig. 3E).

We next performed a morphometric analysis of NRG1 expres-
sion on nerve specimens of merlin-iso1 knockout mice as repre-
sentative for merlin loss in vivo and corresponding wild-type
littermates (Fig. 4A). Evaluation of the stainings revealed no sig-
niﬁcant difference in 3-week-old animals concerning the percent-
age of NRG1-positive myelinated ﬁbres (Fig. 4B). However,
in
8-week-old mice a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of
NRG1-positive ﬁbres was found in merlin-iso1-deﬁcient animals
compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4C). This indicates that
sciatic nerve tissue of merlin knockout mice exhibits an age-
dependent downregulation of NRG1 type III.

NRG1 expression in human sural nerve
biopsies

To underline the clinical relevance of our ﬁndings, we analysed
human sural nerve biopsies from seven patients with NF2, healthy
control individuals, and reference samples showing neuropathies of
different aetiologies. The age and gender of the investigated pa-
tients with NF2 did not differ signiﬁcantly from those of the control
group (mean age NF2: 44  11.63 years, controls: 55  11.96

chronic

inﬂammatory

demyelinating

years). The percentage of NRG1-positive myelinated ﬁbres as indi-
cated by expression of myelin protein zero was signiﬁcantly lower
in NF2 samples compared with controls and with chronic inﬂam-
matory demyelinating polyneuropathy and axonopathy samples
(mean value for NF2: 20%  13%, for controls: 77%  16%,
for
polyneuropathy:
61%  12% and for axonopathy: 45%  13%; NF2 versus con-
trols: P 5 0.001, NF2 versus chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy: P 5 0.001, NF2 versus axonopathy: P = 0.004).
In addition, chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
and axonopathy samples showed signiﬁcantly reduced percentages
of NRG1-positive myelinated ﬁbres when compared with controls
(P = 0.014 for controls versus chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy, P 5 0.001 for
controls versus axonopathy).
Comparing all four groups, the reduction of NRG1-positive ﬁbres
was most prominent in patients with NF2 (Fig. 5A and B). Besides,
ﬁbre density quantiﬁcations of the same samples revealed that
biopsies taken from patients with NF2 show the lowest number
of axons per mm2 indicating a severe chronic axonopathy
(Fig. 5C). To verify the histomorphological results in terms of
NRG1 levels, we also conducted immunoblotting to determine
the expression of NRG1 type III in sural nerve biopsies of patients
with NF2 and healthy control ssubjects. Consistently, lysates of

sural nerves from two patients showed signiﬁcantly reduced NRG1

ERBB2 receptor upregulation following
neuronal loss of merlin

Upon loss of neuronal merlin a reduction in NRG1 type III levels
was detected. Surprisingly we observed a hypermyelination of
nerve ﬁbres in these merlin-deﬁcient animals in vivo. We therefore

speculated that the ERBB2 receptor expression on Schwann cells
might be increased in compensation to the reduced levels of NRG1
type III. We ﬁrst performed morphometric analysis of ERBB2 re-
ceptor expression on nerve specimens of merlin-iso1 knockout
mice and corresponding wild-type littermates (Fig. 6A). The
number of ERBB2-positive myelinated ﬁbres appeared signiﬁcantly
upregulated in 8-week-old knockout mice (Fig. 6B). Consistently,
sciatic nerve lysates of mice lacking merlin in an isoform-speciﬁc
manner also show elevated levels of ERBB2 detected by western
blotting (Fig. 6C).

In addition, we analysed human sural nerve biopsies of patients
with NF2, healthy control
individuals, and reference samples
showing neuropathies of various aetiologies. Immunohistochemi-
cally, no ERBB2 labelling was detected in normal nerve tissue
(Fig. 6D), but ERBB2 appeared markedly increased in pathological
conditions with highest levels occurring in vasculitis followed by
NF2, axonopathy and chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating poly-
neuropathy (Fig. 6E). Strikingly, upregulation of ERBB2 correlated
with the decrease in NRG1-positive myelinated ﬁbres (P = 0.003).

To verify our results and to exclude Schwann cell-intrinsic sig-
nalling events, we tested peripheral nerve tissue from mice bearing
neuron-speciﬁc loss of merlin (Nefh-Cre;Nf2ﬂox) for ERBB2 levels.
Intriguingly, ERBB2 receptor expression was found to be upregu-
lated following neuron-speciﬁc loss of merlin, whereas NRG1
levels appeared consistently lower (Fig. 7A and B). By immuno-
blotting we further found that merlin downregulation in neurons
in both heterozygous and homozygous conditional merlin knock-
out mice, is associated with increased ERBB2 expression (Fig. 7C).

This indicates that increased ERBB2 levels in Schwann cells are a
clear consequence of merlin loss in the neuronal compartment.

However, despite ERBB2 upregulation, sciatic nerve lysates of
neuron-speciﬁc merlin knockout mice showed a reduced activation
of the downstream signals indicated by reduced phosphorylation
of Akt (Fig. 1A and E) as well as a member of the MAP kinase
pathway Erk1/2 (Fig. 7C). Together our ﬁndings show that at least
the two best known downstream target cues of ERBB2/3 recep-
tors—PI-3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathway (Mei and Xiong,
2008)—show reduced activity despite increased ERBB2 levels. By
immunohistochemistry on sciatic nerve cross-sections we could
qualitatively show the primary source of Akt and Erk signalling
to be of Schwann cell rather than axonal origin (Supplementary
Figs 4 and 5).

Discussion

We report here a novel and clinically relevant ﬁnding concerning
the tumour suppressor protein merlin, mutations of which are the
cause of the hereditary tumour syndrome NF2. In addition to its
well-established, growth-restricting functions in Schwann cells, we
identiﬁed that axonally expressed merlin modiﬁes Schwann cell
activity. Taken together, we link merlin to one of the best-
characterized signalling pathways of crosstalk between Schwann
cells and axons, the NRG1–ERBB2/3 pathway. Our ﬁndings are of
great importance because a highly interdependent relationship be-
tween Schwann cells and axons is required to maintain proper
integrity and functionality of peripheral nerves throughout lifetime.
In line with this notion, damage to one cell type invariably leads to
pathophysiological changes in the other (Fricker and Bennett,
2011).

First of all, through regulation of decisive axonal surface pro-
teins—namely NRG1 type III—the Nf2 gene product determines
the expression of growth factor-like molecules on axons important
for Schwann cell actions such as proliferation and myelination. By
means of different mouse models as well as sural nerve biopsies of
patients with NF2, we could show that the loss of merlin or even
reduction of merlin gene dosage in the neuronal compartment
results in the downregulation of NRG1 type III. In contrast, loss
of merlin speciﬁcally in Schwann cells had no effect on NRG1 type
III expression.

How the loss of merlin in neurons mechanistically leads to a
levels is presently not clear. Our
decrease in NRG1 type III
in vitro experiments showed that merlin overexpression in primary
dorsal root ganglion cells and a neuronal cell
line results in an
increased level of the active NRG1 type III; a ﬁnding apparently
independent of Nrg1 gene expression regulation. Several studies
have already identiﬁed a post-transcriptional regulation of neure-
gulins by different proteases such as BACE1 (Velanac et al., 2012)
or TACE (La Marca et al., 2011) mediating cleavage and process-
ing of NRG1 type III to its active form. Whether merlin modiﬁes
NRG1 type III levels through ﬁne-tuning the activity of proteases
remains to be established.

Several ﬁndings have suggested that reduced expression of
axonal NRG1 type III in the PNS results in thinner myelination
(Michailov et al., 2004). It is therefore obscure why the in vivo

Axonal merlin regulates neuregulin 1 type III expression

Brain 2014: 137; 420–432 | 431

reduction of neuronal merlin, which is accompanied by reduced
NRG1 type III levels, results in increased myelination. Intriguingly
we detected an increase in ERBB2 receptor in Schwann cells, a
likely compensatory reaction towards the reduced axonal expres-
sion of the ligand—NRG1 type III. This increase in ERBB2 receptor
that functions as a co-receptor with EGFR, ERBB3 and ERBB4
could theoretically induce aberrant promyelination signals leading
to the observed hyper-myelination.

However, when we traced the typical signalling activity down-
stream of ERBB2 in Schwann cells, such as phosphorylation of Akt
or Erk, we found that these signals were rather decreased. It is
plausible that an increase of ERBB2 may lead to other distinct
downstream promyelinating signalling activities, for example the
small GTPase RAC1. Moreover it is possible that there might exist
other neuronal factors affected by merlin independent of the neur-
egulin network that determine myelination. For instance laminin/
integrin (McKee et al., 2012) and GPR126 (Monk et al., 2011)
signalling in Schwann cell myelination have already been shown.
These extracellular cues may function independently and/or co-
operatively with NRG1/ERBB2 signalling cascade to control mye-
lination. These potentially key extracellular signalling alterations
have not yet been tested in our system. Nonetheless it is clear
that changes in merlin activity, speciﬁcally in the axon, modiﬁes
Schwann cell behaviour in part through an abnormal NRG1 type
III–ERBB2 network leaving the peripheral nerve possibly vulnerable
to abnormal maintenance and repair.

Interestingly,

increased ERBB2 expression appears to be very
speciﬁc to the loss of merlin in NF2 disease because sural nerve
biopsy samples of patients with chronic inﬂammatory demyelinat-
ing polyneuropathy and axonopathy with decreased NRG1 type III
levels did not show an upregulation of ERBB2 expression. Again,
whether merlin regulates axonal factors in addition to NRG1 type
III inﬂuencing ERBB2 expression on Schwann cells remains to be
elucidated.

However, it is clear that particularly the loss of axonal merlin
increases Schwann cell susceptibility towards mitogenic factors indi-
cated by elevated ERBB2 levels. Merlin-deﬁcient Schwann cells and
human NF2 schwannomas have been previously shown to over-
express ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptor molecules (Lallemand et al.,
2009). Consequently, the ERBB2/3 receptor has been identiﬁed as
a potential target for NF2 therapy (Clark et al., 2008). The use of
trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody interfering with ERBB2 recep-
tor activity, is already in clinical use in breast cancer therapy.

Taken together, our data indicate that ERBB2/3 expression
levels in Schwann cells are controlled by both merlin levels
within Schwann cell themselves (Lallemand et al., 2009) as well
as by the axonal compartment through the NRG1 type III signal-
ling, as identiﬁed here.

Further functional studies are required to elucidate a possible
contribution of axonal merlin to the early events of NF2-related
tumour development. Presently, existing NF2 mouse models pri-
marily focus on merlin loss in Schwann cells. Neuronal merlin,
which is also affected by Nf2 germline mutations, is not taken
into account. New mouse models of the disease addressing the
importance of the microenvironment of peripheral nerves are
therefore required.
