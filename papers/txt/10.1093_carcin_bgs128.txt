The oncoprotein ErbB3 is overexpressed in several human cancers,
for example in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in ovarian cancers,
and ErbB3-containing heterodimers have been demonstrated to be
potent signaling units in carcinogenesis. This especially applies to
ErbB2–ErbB3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–
ErbB3 heterodimers providing anti-apoptotic signaling. Relatively
little is understood about the signaling of EGFR–ErbB3 hetero-
dimers and especially about mechanisms involved in downregulation
of ErbB3 from the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to EGFR
homodimers, for which trafﬁcking has been extensively character-
ized. In the present study, we have investigated mechanisms involved
in endocytosis of ErbB3 in porcine aortic endothelial cells stably
expressing either ErbB3 only or stably expressing ErbB3 and EGFR.
Our data show that ErbB3 is endocytosed in the absence of added
ligand, independently of its tyrosine phosphorylation state and in
a clathrin-dependent manner. Functional EGFR–ErbB3 hetero-
dimers were observed to be formed, and dimerization with ErbB3
was observed to negatively affect endocytosis of the EGFR.

Introduction

The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases induce growth, differ-
entiation and survival signaling in a variety of cell types by conveying
signals upon binding of different ligands [reviewed in refs. 1–3]. The
ErbB family consists of four closely related members: epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB1 or
HER1), ErbB2 (HER2/Neu), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Sig-
nal transduction by these receptor tyrosine kinases depends on their
dimerization (4,5). Despite their overall similar structure, ErbB pro-
teins differ in their properties with respect to ligand-binding and
kinase activity. EGFR and ErbB4 both bind ligands and form homo-
and/or heterodimers, whereas ErbB2 is an orphan receptor incapable
of binding ligand (6,7). While non-liganded receptors normally exist
in a folded conformation preventing dimerization, ErbB2 has a con-
stitutively extended conformation, making it constantly available for

interaction with other ErbB proteins (8). ErbB3 can bind several
ligands but was for a long time considered kinase dead (9–11). It
was recently reported that ErbB3 in fact possesses weak tyrosine
kinase activity but that efﬁcient phosphorylation depends on hetero-
dimerization (12,13). ErbB3 is also considered unable to form homo-
dimers (14). The ErbB2–ErbB3 signaling complex is potent
in
mediating anti-apoptotic signaling (15), and recent studies have
reported a critical role for ErbB3 in mediating EGFR-dependent pro-
liferative signaling in pancreatic cancers (16). Even though ErbB3 has
little oncogenic potential in its own capacity, when trans-phosphory-
lated, it efﬁciently induces activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase,
since it has six binding sites for the p85 subunit (17–19). These
characteristics make ErbB3 an important player in tumor biology
and an interesting target for anticancer therapy [reviewed in refs.
8,20–22].

Receptor downregulation is essential to ﬁne-tune signaling [reviewed
in ref. 23]. While EGFR is known to undergo EGF-induced endocytosis
and lysosomal degradation [reviewed in refs. 8,24,25], several lines of
evidence have suggested that other ErbB proteins are endocytosed in-
efﬁciently (26–28). ErbB2, -3 and -4 have, in contrast to EGFR, been
reported not to interact with the clathrin adaptor protein complex-2 and
therefore to be inefﬁciently internalized (26). The full explanation for
ErbB2’s endocytosis impairment is still unclear but could result from
stabilization upon interaction of ErbB2 with heat shock protein Hsp90
(29). Furthermore, it appears that unlike EGFR homodimers, ligand-
activated EGFR–ErbB2 heterodimers are unable to induce formation of
clathrin-coated pits and/or to translocate into clathrin-coated pits
(28,30). To what extent ErbB3 is endocytosed and whether heterodi-
merization and transactivation are required for internalization of ErbB3
has also been unclear. ErbB3 was ﬁrst suggested to be endocytosis
impaired, based on a study demonstrating that the chimeric receptor
consisting of the EGFR extracellular domain and the ErbB3 intracel-
lular domain failed to efﬁciently internalize 125I-EGF (26). It was later
reported that ErbB3 had a very low rate of ligand-dependent internal-
ization (31), whereas it was in other studies proposed that ErbB3 was
internalized and efﬁciently recycled (27). It has also by several authors
been reported that ErbB3 has a relatively short half-life (around 2.5–3.5
h) (27,32,33). The ErbB3 ligand heregulin (HRG) exists in a number of
isoforms, which all share an EGF-like domain but differ with respect to
the N-terminal domain (32). A short recombinant HRG-b1, containing
the EGF-like domain only (herein referred to as HRG-b1), was dem-
onstrated to have no effect on the turnover of surface-localized ErbB3.
However, downregulation of ErbB3 was enhanced in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells by incubation with a recombinant HRG-b1, containing
the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, herein referred to as HRG-b1
extracellular domain (HRG-b1 ECD). This could be due to increased
ability of HRG-b1 ECD to disrupt higher order oligomers of ErbB3
(32). The ubiquitin ligase neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1
(Nrdp1) has further been reported to be involved in the constitutive
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ErbB3 (34,35). In-
creased stability of Nrdp1 has in turn been suggested to correlate with
increased levels of the deubiquitinating protein Ubiquitin C-terminal
hydrolase 8 (USP8, also called UBPY) (36). Interestingly, USP8 ap-
pears to be upregulated by binding of HRG-b1 to ErbB3. The half-life
of ErbB3 was reported to be 2.5 h in the absence of HRG-b1 but 0.5 h in
the presence of HRG-b1 (33). It should be noted that some cancer cells,
in addition to having increased levels of ErbB proteins, have decreased
levels of Nrdp1, thereby making the ubiquitin-dependent control of
ErbB3 levels inefﬁcient (37).

Endocytosis of signaling receptors is important in counteraction of
carcinogenesis. This is because upon internalization, the receptor
cannot longer bind growth factors localized extracellularly. Further-
more, proteins in early endosomes will either be recycled to the

plasma membrane or sorted to late endosomes/lysosomes, where deg-
radation of both ErbB proteins and their bound ligands will occur. The
extent of ErbB3 endocytosis and the potential mechanisms involved in
ErbB3 internalization are still unclear and debated. We have in the
current study investigated characteristics of ErbB3 endocytosis. We
now report that like in case of ErbB2, dimerization of ErbB3 with
EGFR has an inhibitory effect on endocytosis of EGF. However, the
inhibitory effect on EGFR downregulation is less pronounced than in
case of EGFR–ErbB2 dimers. We also demonstrate that ErbB3 is
endocytosed in the absence of added ligand in a clathrin-dependent
manner but independently of its tyrosine phosphorylation.

Materials and methods

Materials
Human recombinant EGF was from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland),
HRG-b1 ECD was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and TO-PRO-3
iodide was from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Other chemicals were from
Sigma Chemicals Co. (St Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted.

Cell culture and treatment
HeLa cells, MCF-7 cells and SK-BR-3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium with L-glutamine (2 mM). Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cell
lines were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium with L-glutamine (2 mM). Media were
from the Lonza Group Ltd (Basel, Switzerland). For all cells, 0.5  penicillin–
streptomycin (Lonza Group Ltd) and 10% fetal bovine serum were routinely
used, whereas for SK-BR-3 cells, 15% fetal bovine serum was used. Stably
transfected PAE cells expressing EGFR only (PAE.B2, here referred to as
PAE.EGFR) were from Alexander Sorkin (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
PA). PAE.EGFR.ErbB2 and PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were described previously
(28,38). PAE.ErbB3 cells were established by stable transfection of PAE cells
(obtained from Carl-Henrik Heldin, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,
Uppsala, Sweden), using the plasmid pcDNA3.1 Hygro(þ) ErbB3 (38) and
standard single cell cloning procedures (39). The transfection reagent FuGENE
6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was used in accordance with the man-
ufacturer’s recommendations. Geniticin (G418) (400 lg/ml), zeocin (30 lg/ml)
and hygromycin (60 lg/ml) (all from Life Technologies) were added to the
media used for the stably transfected PAE cells to select for clones stably
expressing EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3, respectively. For receptor expression levels
in HeLa, SK-BR-3 and PAE cells, see Supplementary Figure S1, available at
Carcinogenesis Online. For receptor activation experiments, 10 nM EGF
(60 ng/ml), 10 nM HRG-b1 (80 ng/ml) or 10 nM HRG-b1 ECD (269 ng/ml)
was added to cells in minimal essential medium (MEM) without bicarbonate
(Life Technologies) in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In experi-
ments investigating downregulation from the plasma membrane and degradation
of EGFR or ErbB3, 25 lg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) and 10 nM EGF, HRG-b1
or HRG-b1 ECD was added. For activation of c-Met, 1.25 nM hepatocyte growth
factor (100 ng/ml) was used and to inhibit the c-Met kinase activity, cells were
preincubated with 2 lM SU11274 overnight and then serum starved in MEM
with 2 lM SU11274 for 15 min before incubation with hepatocyte growth factor
in the presence of SU11274. For inhibition of ErbB3 phosphorylation, 5 lM
AG1478 (Life Technologies) was used, including 2 h serum starvation and
preincubation with MEM containing AG1478.

Plasmids and small interfering RNAs
For knockdown of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), the target sequence was
GCAAUGAGCUGUUUGAAGA (40). Control cells were transfected with
either Silencer Negative Control #1 or with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
to green ﬂuorescent protein (target sequence: GCACAAGCUCCACUGCAA-
CUACA), as indicated in ﬁgure legends and as described previously (41). All
siRNA duplexes were synthesized and annealed by Life Technologies. For
transient expression of ErbB3, the pcDNA3.1 Hygro(þ) ErbB3 plasmid was
used (38).

Transfection of cells
Cells were transfected with siRNA twice with a 48 h interval using Lipofecta-
mineTM 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations, using 28 ll LipofectamineTM 2000 and 750 pmol siRNA for each T-75
tissue culture ﬂask. Transient transfection with the ErbB3-encoding plasmid
was performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent 20–24 h prior to experi-
ments, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Antibodies
Mouse anti-ErbB3 and mouse anti-EGFR antibodies were from Lab Vision
(Fremont, CA). Sheep anti-EGFR antibody was from Fitzgerald Industries

1032

International (Concord, MA). Rabbit anti-ErbB3, goat anti-Akt, rabbit anti-
Erk and rabbit anti-Numb antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-b-actin and rabbit anti-b-tubulin antibodies were
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Rabbit anti-p-ErbB3 (pY1289), rabbit anti-
p-Erk and rabbit anti-p-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA). Mouse anti-p-EGFR (pY1173) and rabbit anti-early endosome
antigen 1 (EEA1) antibodies were from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey
anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-p-Met (pY1234/1235) and mouse anti-transferrin
receptor antibodies were from Life Technologies. Rhodamine-Red-X-
conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, anti-sheep, anti-goat and
anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories
(West Grove, PA). Mouse anti-CHC antibody was from BD Biosciences
(Erembodegem, Belgium).

Western blotting
Cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and western blotting as described (42), and proteins were
detected using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate from
Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL). Proteins were visualized using
the KODAK Image Station 4000R from Carestream Health (Rochester, NY).
Quantiﬁcations were performed using KODAK Molecular Imaging software,
version 4.0.

Internalization of 125I-EGF
Internalization of 125I-EGF (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was performed
essentially as described (41). Cells were incubated with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml)
alone or with 125I-EGF in combination with 10 nM HRG-b1 or HRG-b1 ECD
for the times indicated. Cells were lysed in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in
phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice, and the radioactivity in the frac-
tions containing cell surface-bound and internalized 125I-EGF was measured in
a c-counter (1470 Wallac WIZARD, PerkinElmer). Statistical signiﬁcance was
tested using the two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were incubated as described in ﬁgure legends before being trypsinized
and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Riedel-de Hae¨n, Seelze, Germany) in
Sorensen’s phosphate buffer. Flow cytometry analysis was performed as
described previously (43), using mouse anti-ErbB3, mouse anti-EGFR and
phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The samples were
analyzed using a FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). A minimum of 10 000 cells were analyzed for each sample. Unstained
cells, incubated with the secondary antibody only, were included in the anal-
ysis to show background ﬂuorescence. Statistical signiﬁcance was tested using
the two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy
Cells were grown in 6 cm culture dishes and incubated as described in ﬁgure
legends before being ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained as
described (28). The cells were examined by confocal microscopy analysis
(Leica TCS SP; Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany and Olympus
FluoView FV1000; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and pictures were
processed using Adobe Photoshop CS4.

Since downregulation of ErbB3 from the plasma membrane is poorly
understood, we investigated the efﬁciency by which ErbB3 was down-
regulated in PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells. In non-stimulated cells immu-
nolabeled with antibodies to ErbB3 or EGFR, ErbB3 was found both
at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles (Figure 1A,
upper panels). These vesicles were both EEA1 positive and EEA1
negative. In contrast, non-liganded EGFR appeared mostly at the cell
surface, not colocalizing with EEA1 (Figure 1A, lower panels).

To conﬁrm that ErbB3 was

internalized from the plasma
membrane, PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were incubated on ice with an
antibody that recognized the extracellular part of ErbB3 (44). The
cells were then washed to remove unbound antibody and either left
on ice or chased at 37°C for 15 min before ﬁxation. While cells
incubated on ice displayed clear plasma membrane staining for the

Fig. 1. ErbB3 was localized to endosomes and downregulated from the plasma membrane in the absence of added ligand. (A) PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were ﬁxed,
permeabilized and immunostained with mouse anti-ErbB3 antibody (upper left panel) or mouse anti-EGFR antibody (lower left panel) and rabbit anti-EEA1
antibody (middle panels), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. The cells were
subsequently analyzed by confocal microscopy. Right panels represent merged left and middle panels. Scale bar, 10 lm. The framed areas are shown at higher
magniﬁcation in the lower left corner of the respective micrographs. (B–D) PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were incubated with or without CHX (25 lg/ml) for 5 h at
37°C, then trypsinized, ﬁxed and labeled with mouse anti-ErbB3 (B) or mouse anti-EGFR antibodies (C) followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse
antibodies. The surface level of ErbB3 and EGFR was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The curves represent unstained cells (only secondary antibody) and one of three
parallels for each condition from a representative experiment. (D) The average median values of four experiments with three parallels each, ±pooled standard
deviation, were plotted. The data are presented as percentage of control values from cells incubated without CHX.

anti-ErbB3 antibody (Supplementary Figure S2A, available at Carci-
nogenesis Online), in cells incubated at 37°C, anti-ErbB3 antibody
was also observed in EEA1 positive endosomes (Supplementary
Figure S2B and D, available at Carcinogenesis Online). To make sure
that endocytosis of ErbB3 was not induced by the antibody, the cells
were incubated with or without anti-ErbB3 antibody for 30 min on ice
and subsequently washed and chased in MEM for 30 min at 37°C.
Upon ﬁxation, the cells were stained with the same antibody before
the amount of anti-ErbB3 antibody at the plasma membrane was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The cells that had been preincubated
with antibody showed no reduction in ErbB3 plasma membrane level

(Supplementary Figure S2E and F, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). Instead, the level of ErbB3 at the plasma membrane was
slightly increased. This increase could potentially be explained by
longer incubation with the antibody allowing increased binding
(preﬁxation and postﬁxation incubation) and/or by increased antibody
afﬁnity for native (preﬁxation) ErbB3 compared with ErbB3 exposed
to ﬁxatives.

To directly compare the rate of downregulation of EGFR and
ErbB3 from the plasma membrane, PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were
incubated with or without CHX for 5 h at 37°C, and the surface levels
of EGFR and ErbB3 were then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The rate

1033

of ErbB3 downregulation from the cell surface (Figure 1B) was
signiﬁcantly higher than for the EGFR (Figure 1C). While .50%
of ErbB3 was downregulated from the plasma membrane upon 5 h
incubation, the level of EGFR was only reduced by 20% (Figure 1D).
We additionally examined endocytosis of ErbB3 in human cells.
Since endogenous ErbB3 was not detectable in HeLa cells (Supple-
mentary Figure S1A, available at Carcinogenesis Online), we tran-
siently transfected HeLa cells with an ErbB3-encoding plasmid. Upon
incubation with anti-ErbB3 antibody and chase for 30 min at 37°C,
anti-ErbB3 antibodies localized intracellularly in both SK-BR-3 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3, available at Carcinogenesis Online, upper
panels), HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S3, available at Carcino-
genesis Online,
lower panels) and MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Figure S4B, available at Carcinogenesis Online). A large fraction of
the anti-ErbB3 positive vesicles was found to colocalize with EEA1
(Supplementary Figure S3, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
ErbB3 was also internalized in PAE.ErbB3 cells with no expression
of other ErbB proteins (Figures 2A and 3B).

ErbB3 has been found to dimerize with and be activated by c-Met
(45–47), and PAE cells endogenously express c-Met (48). In order to
investigate the potential role of cross talk between c-Met and ErbB3
during internalization, PAE.ErbB3 cells were incubated with the
c-Met kinase
inhibitor SU11274 (49). As demonstrated in
Figure 2A, ErbB3 was internalized and colocalized with EEA1 also
in cells incubated with the c-Met inhibitor, even though western blot
analysis of cells incubated with SU11274 demonstrated efﬁcient
inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation upon incubation with hepatocyte
growth factor (Figure 2B).

We observed a small constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB3 in
PAE.ErbB3 cells, accompanied by constitutive activation of Erk and
Akt (Figure 3A). As also demonstrated in Figure 3A, phosphorylation
of ErbB3, Erk and Akt increased upon incubation with HRG-b1. The
constitutive, as well as the HRG-b1-induced signaling, was not
affected by c-Met kinase inhibition (data not shown). It has been
proposed that c-Src can phosphorylate ErbB3 and that this phosphor-
ylation can be reduced using an inhibitor of c-Src kinase activity
(50,51). However, when we used the c-Src kinase speciﬁc inhibitor
SU6656 (52), we did not observe any effect on the ErbB3 phosphor-
ylation (data not shown). The EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, has
been reported to inhibit HRG-b1-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2
and ErbB3, in addition to inhibiting the EGFR (53). Consistently,
when we incubated PAE.ErbB3 cells with AG1478, both the consti-
tutive and the HRG-b1-induced phosphorylation of ErbB3, Erk and
Akt were efﬁciently blocked (Figure 3A). This could either suggest
that ErbB3 to some extent forms homodimers and that AG1478 is not
fully EGFR speciﬁc or that there are small amounts of AG1478-
inhibitable non-deﬁned kinase activity in PAE cells. Internalization
of ErbB3 was, however, not inhibited upon incubation with AG1478
(Figure 3B). Also in MCF-7 cells, did AG1478 efﬁciently block HRG-
b1-induced signaling (Supplementary Figure S4A, available at Car-
cinogenesis Online) without having effect on ErbB3 internalization
(Supplementary Figure S4B, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
These data support the notion that ErbB3 is internalized in the absence

Fig. 2. ErbB3 was endocytosed in the absence of other ErbB proteins and
independently of the c-Met kinase activity. (A) PAE.ErbB3 cells were
preincubated overnight with the c-Met kinase inhibitor SU11274 (2 lM) in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or with DMSO alone (control). The cells were
then incubated with mouse anti-ErbB3 (in MEM with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin ±kinase inhibitor) for 30 min on ice before washing in ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline and chasing in MEM (±kinase inhibitor) for
15 min at 37°C before ﬁxation. After permeabilization, subcellular
localization of the anti-ErbB3 antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Early endosomes were localized with rabbit
anti-EEA1 antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody. The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 10 lm.
(B) PAE.ErbB3 cells were preincubated overnight with SU11274 (2 lM) in
DMSO or with DMSO alone (Control). The cells were then incubated
(±kinase inhibitor) without ligand ( ), with 1.25 nM hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) or 10 nM HRG-b1 for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were lysed and
subjected to western blotting. Phosphorylated c-Met was detected with rabbit
anti-p-Met (pY1234/1235) antibody. Antibody to the transferrin receptor
(a-TfR) was used as loading control. The ﬁgure shows one representative
experiment of three.

Fig. 3. ErbB3 was endocytosed independently of its phosphorylation.
(A) PAE.ErbB3 cells were preincubated with or without the EGFR kinase
inhibitor AG1478 (5 lM) for 2 h. The cells were then incubated (±kinase
inhibitor) with or without 10 nM HRG-b1 for 3 min at 37°C. The cells were
lysed and subjected to western blotting using antibodies to phosphorylated
and total ErbB3, Akt and Erk. Antibody to transferrin receptor (a-TfR) was
used as loading control. (B) PAE.ErbB3 cells were preincubated with or
without AG1478 (5 lM) for 2 h. The cells were then incubated with mouse
anti-ErbB3 antibody (in MEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin ±kinase

saline and chasing in MEM (±kinase inhibitor) for 15 min at 37°C before

detected with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Early
endosomes were localized with rabbit anti-EEA1 antibody followed by
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The cells were analyzed by
confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 10 lm. The ﬁgure shows one representative

of added ligand and that endocytosis does not depend on ErbB3
phosphorylation.

Endocytosis of ErbB3 was clathrin dependent
To study by which endocytic pathway ErbB3 is internalized, we trans-
fected PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells with siRNA to CHC. As demonstrated,
the level of CHC was strongly reduced, whereas the level of ErbB3
remained almost unchanged (Figure 4A). Since EGFR is mainly en-
docytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner (40,54,55), EGF-induced
downregulation of EGFR from the plasma membrane was used as
a positive control. As expected, the EGFR level was also unchanged,
and ligand-induced downregulation of EGFR was strongly inhibited
in clathrin-depleted cells (Supplementary Figure S5A–C, available at
Carcinogenesis Online). We then investigated the internalization of
anti-ErbB3 antibodies and found that while cells transfected with
control siRNA exhibited vesicular anti-ErbB3 staining (Figure 4B, left
panel), cells depleted of clathrin displayed a strong plasma membrane
staining (Figure 4B, right panel). The inhibition of ErbB3 endocytosis
in cells transfected with siRNA to CHC was quantiﬁed manually. Data
showed that depletion of CHC efﬁciently inhibited endocytosis of
ErbB3, since ,10% of the cells showed endosomal labeling for anti-
ErbB3 (Figure 4C). Also, ﬂow cytometry analysis conﬁrmed that down-
regulation of ErbB3 from the plasma membrane in cells where CHC
had been depleted was signiﬁcantly inhibited (Figure 4D and E). CHC
knockdown strongly reduced ErbB3 internalization also in MCF-7

cells (Supplementary Figure S5D and E, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). We thus conclude that the observed internalization of ErbB3
is clathrin dependent.

ErbB3 was activated upon incubation with ligand but was degraded
independently of added ligand
To investigate whether ErbB3 and EGFR formed functional hetero-
dimers in PAE cells, we investigated receptor phosphorylation in
PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells. The cells were incubated with or without
EGF, HRG-b1, HRG-b1 ECD or combinations of each HRG and
EGF. Cell lysates were then subjected to western blotting using
phosphotyrosine-speciﬁc antibodies. Although, when compared with
PAE.ErbB3 cells, PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells express less ErbB3 (see
Supplementary Figure S1, available at Carcinogenesis Online),
HRG-b1- and HRG-b1 ECD-induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 were
most pronounced in PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells (Figure 5A compare with
Figure 3A). This strongly suggests that HRG can induce formation of
EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimeres followed by EGFR-mediated trans-
phosphorylation of ErbB3. Phosphorylation of ErbB3 was, however,
not increased upon incubation with EGF. Activation of EGFR was
clearly induced by addition of EGF but not by HRG-b1 or HRG-b1
ECD (Figure 5A). This is consistent with the notion that while ErbB3
can transactivate and be trans-phosphorylated by the EGFR, the
EGFR cannot be trans-phosphorylated by ErbB3, which has mar-
ginal kinase activity (13). In the samples where EGF was added in

as loading control. (B) PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells transfected with either Silencer Negative Control siRNA (left panel) or siRNA to CHC (right panel). The cells were
then incubated with mouse anti-ErbB3 antibody (in MEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min on ice before washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline and chasing in MEM for 15 min at 37°C before ﬁxation. After permeabilization, localization of anti-ErbB3 antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-

endocytosis in cells transfected with siRNA to CHC or with control siRNA (siRNA to green ﬂuorescent protein), the cells were counted manually, classifying the
cells with respect to content of vesicles containing anti-ErbB3 antibody. A minimum of 50 cells were counted from each of two separate experiments. The cells

for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were then lysed and subjected to western blotting
with antibodies to phosphorylated and total ErbB3 and phosphorylated Akt
(upper panel) as well as phosphorylated and total EGFR and phosphorylated
Erk (lower panel). Anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody was used as
loading control. The ﬁgure demonstrates one representative experiment of

10 nM EGF or HRG-b1 for 1, 3 or 5 h at 37°C. CHX (25 lg/ml) was included
in all samples except for the control (0 h). The cells were lysed and subjected
to western blotting using rabbit anti-ErbB3, sheep anti-EGFR and rabbit
anti-Tubulin (loading control) antibodies. The ﬁgure shows one
representative experiment of three. Net luminescence values of bands
corresponding to ErbB3 or EGFR were normalized to the loading control,
quantiﬁed and plotted as percentage of control (shown as histograms below
the respective wells). (C) PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were incubated with 10
nM HRG-b1 or HRG-b1 ECD for 1, 3 or 6 h at 37°C. CHX (25 lg/ml) was
added to all samples except the control (0 h). Western blotting and
quantiﬁcation was performed as in (B). The ﬁgure demonstrates one
representative experiment of three.

combination with either HRG-b1 or HRG-b1 ECD, there was a re-
duced phosphorylation of ErbB3 compared with upon incubation with
each HRG variant alone. This could possibly be explained by EGF-
induced formation of EGFR homodimers and consequently reduced
amounts of EGFR available for ErbB3 interaction. The formation of
functional dimers was conﬁrmed by the observed activation of down-
stream targets (Figure 5A). Erk was activated upon incubation with
either ligand but appeared most intensely phosphorylated in the pres-
ence of EGF. Akt phosphorylation, on the other hand, was strongest

1036

upon incubation with the HRGs, consistent with the ﬁnding that ErbB3
signals mainly through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway (16).
HRG-b1 was previously demonstrated to have no effect on the
turnover of surface-localized ErbB3, while downregulation of ErbB3
was enhanced by HRG-b1 ECD in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and this
could be due to better ability of HRG-b1 ECD to disrupt higher order
oligomers of ErbB3 (32). To investigate whether the ligands had
similar effect in PAE cells, we examined degradation of total ErbB3
in the presence of different ligands. PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells were
incubated without ligand, with EGF, with HRG-b1 or with HRG-b1
ECD for different times in the presence of CHX. Then, the amount of
residual ErbB3 and EGFR was studied by western blotting. While
degradation of EGFR was clearly induced by EGF, ErbB3 was found
to be efﬁciently degraded even in the absence of ligand (Figure 5B).
Neither EGF nor HRG-b1 increased the ErbB3 degradation, arguing
that ErbB3 is mostly degraded independently of added ligand. How-
ever, in consistence with the results of Warren et al. (32), our results
demonstrated that degradation of ErbB3 was somewhat increased
upon incubation with HRG-b1 ECD compared with upon incubation
with HRG-b1 (Figure 5C).

HRG-b1 and HRG-b1 ECD both reduced EGF-induced endocytosis
of the EGFR
We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of ErbB2
inhibited EGF-induced endocytosis of the EGFR (28). We therefore
wanted to study whether overexpression of ErbB3 had a similar effect
on endocytosis of the EGFR. The rate of 125I-EGF internalization in
PAE.EGFR cells,
in PAE.EGFR.ErbB2 cells and in PAE.EG-
FR.ErbB3 cells was compared (Figure 6A). While the rate of endo-
cytosis of 125I-EGF was signiﬁcantly inhibited in PAE.EGFR.ErbB2
cells, no signiﬁcant inhibition was observed in PAE.EGFR.ErbB3
cells incubated with EGF only when compared with PAE.EGFR cells.
To study the efﬁciency of EGFR downregulation from the cell surface,
the same cell lines were incubated for 5 h in the presence of CHX,
with or without EGF. The level of EGFR at the plasma membrane was
investigated by ﬂow cytometry analysis (Figure 6B). Consistent with
data using 125I-EGF, we found that downregulation of cell surface-
localized EGFR was signiﬁcantly inhibited in PAE.EGFR.ErbB2 cells
but not in PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells. Altogether, our data thus argue that
in contrast to ErbB2, expression of ErbB3 as such does not negatively
impact on downregulation of the EGFR. However, when PAE.EG-
FR.ErbB3 cells were incubated with EGF in combination with either
HRG-b1 or HRG-b1 ECD, the rate of EGF internalization was sig-
niﬁcantly reduced by 25% (Figure 6C). A similar result was ob-
served in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure S6A, available at
Carcinogenesis Online). This is consistent with ligand-induced het-
erodimerization upon incubation with HRG-b1 and EGF, but not with
EGF alone, and supports the idea that EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimers are
internalized less efﬁciently than are EGFR homodimers. It should be
noted that HRG-b1 ECD did not affect the internalization of EGF in
cells not expressing ErbB3 (Supplementary Figure S6B, available at
Carcinogenesis Online).

Discussion

We have previously demonstrated that ErbB2 negatively impacts on the
ligand-induced downregulation of EGFR, presumably by tethering
EGFR to the endocytosis-resistant ErbB2 (28,56). In the current study,
we show that ErbB3, upon coexpression with EGFR in PAE cells, did
not affect EGF-induced downregulation of EGFR from the plasma
membrane. Although ErbB3 without bound ligand probably does not
form heterodimers with the EGFR to same extent as does ErbB2, the
data show that expression of ErbB3 as such does not have a negative
impact on EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis. Ligands to ErbB3 have
previously been shown to induce EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimerization
(57–60). In line with this, we observed increased HRG-b1-induced
phosphorylation of ErbB3 in PAE.EGFR.ErbB3 cells compared
with in PAE.ErbB3 cells, supporting the formation of functional

Endocytosis of ErbB3

When HRG-b1 is added alone, EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimers will be
formed and ErbB3 will be strongly trans-phosphorylated by the EGFR.
When EGF is added alone, only EGFR homodimers will be formed, as
shown by the lack of ErbB3 phosphorylation. This is in line with previous
data showing EGF-induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 only in cells with
high expression of ErbB3 (16), indicating inefﬁcient EGF-induced
EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimerization. When HRG-b1 and EGF are added
together, the two ligands will, however, compete with respect to forma-
tion of different dimers. EGF will preferentially induce EGFR homo-
dimers and reduce the amount of EGFR available for HRG-b1-induced
heterodimerization. This will again decrease the level of ErbB3 phos-
phorylation. HRG-b1 will, on the other hand, still induce some EGFR–
ErbB3 heterodimerization, and if EGFR–ErbB3 internalization is in-
hibited compared with EGFR–EGFR internalization, EGF bound to
EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimers will be endocytosed less efﬁciently.

It has been demonstrated that ErbB3, in contrast to EGFR and
ErbB2, displays a granular cytoplasmic distribution in various human
tissues (61,62). In line with this, we observed that ErbB3, but not
EGFR, localized to endosomes in the absence of added ligand. We
also found that ErbB3 was internalized from the plasma membrane in
the absence of added ligand and that internalized ErbB3 partly colo-
calized with EEA1 in PAE cells, HeLa cells and SK-BR-3 cells. Our
data additionally demonstrated that downregulation of ErbB3 from
the plasma membrane to a large extent depended on clathrin. It is,
however, unclear by which mechanism ErbB3 is translocated into
clathrin-coated pits and also which clathrin adaptor proteins can pro-
mote recruitment of ErbB3 to coated pits. It was reported that neither
ErbB2, ErbB3 nor ErbB4 could associate with the a-adaptin subunit
of the adaptor protein complex-2 (26,31). The E3 ubiquitin ligase
Nrdp1 has been shown to interact with ErbB3 independently of
HRG-b1 binding and to promote a steady state degradation of ErbB3
(33,35). One could therefore speculate that, like in case of the EGFR,
ubiquitination serves as a signal for ErbB3 internalization. Flow
cytometry experiments showed that while 55% of ErbB3 was lost
from the cell surface within 5 h in control cells, 20% was lost also in
clathrin-depleted cells. Although this downregulation could poten-
tially be explained by inefﬁcient knockdown of clathrin, it could also
suggest alternative mechanisms of ErbB3 downregulation acting in
parallel with the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway.

As demonstrated in this study, endocytosis of ErbB3 can occur
independently of other ErbB proteins as well as independently of
c-Met kinase activity. We have also demonstrated that ErbB3 was efﬁ-
ciently degraded and that the degradation of ErbB3 was not signiﬁ-
cantly affected by EGF or HRG-b1. However, consistent with
previously reported ﬁndings (32), the degradation of ErbB3 was slightly
enhanced by HRG-b1 ECD. Our data argue that ErbB3 is internalized
regardless of its state of phosphorylation. Although ErbB3 has an
impaired kinase activity (9–11), ErbB3 was demonstrated to have suf-
ﬁcient kinase activity to trans-autophosphorylate its intracellular
domain (13). Consistently, we observed HRG-b1-induced phosphory-
lation of ErbB3 in PAE cells expressing ErbB3 only. Furthermore, it
was suggested that ErbB3 was unable to phosphorylate exogenous
substrates (13). This could potentially explain HRG-b1-induced
inhibition of EGFR downregulation if phosphorylation of adaptor/
effector proteins involved in endocytosis was reduced. Additionally,
we observed a constitutive basal ErbB3 phosphorylation in cells
expressing ErbB3 only. This is in line with data suggesting that
overexpression of ErbB3 alone results in weak ErbB3 phosphorylation
(12,53). The low constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB3 can possibly be
explained by the recent ﬁnding that the carboxyl tail of ErbB3, in
contrast to the tail of EGFR, cannot interface with the kinase domain
and thus lacks autoinhibitory activity (12). The ﬁnding that HRG-b1-
induced ErbB3 phosphorylation in PAE.ErbB3 cells was blocked by the
kinase inhibitor AG1478 supports the notion that ErbB3 has some
constitutive kinase activity, even though AG1478 has until now been
thought of as EGFR speciﬁc. The constitutive as well as the HRG-b1-
induced and c-Met-independent ErbB3 phosphorylation in PAE.ErbB3
cells could further suggest that contrary to previously reported results
(14), ErbB3 may form active homodimers.

EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimers. Also, when cells were incubated with EGF
and HRG-b1 or HRG-b1 ECD, expression of ErbB3 did in fact reduce
endocytosis of EGF, suggesting that ligand-induced EGFR–ErbB3 het-
erodimerization inhibits EGFR endocytosis. The results from the acti-
vation and internalization experiments may seem contradictory. We
observed that incubation with HRG-b1 and EGF together caused reduced
phosphorylation of ErbB3 when compared with incubation with HRG-
b1 only and suggest that this is due to EGF-induced EGFR homodime-
rization and consequently reduced EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimerization. At
the same time, we observed decreased internalization of EGF when
HRG-b1 was added along with EGF and explained this with ligand-
induced EGFR–ErbB3 heterodimerization. These two explanations are,
however, not necessarily contradictory based on the following scenario.

M.M.Sak et al.

In summary, our results show that ErbB3 is endocytosed in a
clathrin-dependent manner in the absence of added ligand and inde-
pendent of its phosphorylation. Additionally, we observed that while
ErbB3 is internalized independently of other ErbB proteins,
its
dimerization with EGFR negatively impacted on internalization of
EGF and downregulation of EGFR from the plasma membrane. This
could cause sustained EGF-induced signaling and contribute to the
oncogenicity of ErbB3.
