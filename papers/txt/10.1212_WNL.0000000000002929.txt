ABSTRACT
Objectives: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) Inter-
national Collaboration Whole-Body MRI (WB-MRI) Working Group reviewed the existing literature
on WB-MRI, an emerging technology for assessing disease in patients with neurofibromatosis
type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN), to recommend opti-
mal image acquisition and analysis methods to enable WB-MRI as an endpoint in NF clinical trials.
Methods: A systematic process was used to review all published data about WB-MRI in NF syn-
dromes to assess diagnostic accuracy, feasibility and reproducibility, and data about specific
techniques for assessment of tumor burden, characterization of neoplasms, and response to
therapy.
Results: WB-MRI at 1.5T or 3.0T is feasible for image acquisition. Short tau inversion recovery (STIR)
sequence is used in all
investigations to date, suggesting consensus about the utility of this
sequence for detection of WB tumor burden in people with NF. There are insufficient data to support
a consensus statement about the optimal imaging planes (axial vs coronal) or 2D vs 3D approaches.
Functional imaging, although used in some NF studies, has not been systematically applied or eval-
uated. There are no comparative studies between regional vs WB-MRI or evaluations of WB-MRI
reproducibility.
Conclusions: WB-MRI is feasible for identifying tumors using both 1.5T and 3.0T systems. The
STIR sequence is a core sequence. Additional investigation is needed to define the optimal
approach for volumetric analysis, the reproducibility of WB-MRI in NF, and the diagnostic perfor-
mance of WB-MRI vs regional MRI. Neurology® 2016;87 (Suppl 1):S31–S39

Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) allows imaging of a large volume of the body in a single image
acquisition session. It has been extensively investigated for the detection and staging of visceral
and osseous tumors1–6 and is well-suited to tumor syndromes including neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN),7–9 as these patients
often have a high burden of tumors as well as large tumors that cross anatomic planes (figure).
WB-MRI has been used to evaluate tumor burden and to characterize neoplasms in patients
with NF syndromes10–23 and is being used in some clinical trials to evaluate response to therapy
(NCT01207687). A uniform image acquisition protocol and interpretation method would
enable WB-MRI to be used as a key endpoint to assess tumor treatment response in multicenter

included if they had a prospective or retrospective study design

Inclusion of patients based on well-established clinical criteria
for the NF syndromes was adequate for selection of the patient pop-
ulation, given that pathologic confirmation of each neoplasm is not
feasible.7–9 All included articles were analyzed for diagnosis (NF1,
NF2, and SWN), index test (WB-MRI), and reference test (clinical
criteria for diagnosis of the NF syndromes). The following infor-
mation was extracted from articles: author name, year of publica-
tion, number of participants, specific tumor syndrome, magnet
strength (1.5T vs 3.0T), specific WB-MRI techniques (2D vs 3D
imaging, specific imaging sequences, inclusion of functional MRI
sequences, contrast administration), sex, mean age with SD, quan-
tification of PNST size (2D vs volumetric), and types of tumors
(malignant vs benign PNST). WB-MRI studies were also classified
by clinical indication into 3 categories: tumor detection (including
extent of disease), tumor characterization, or response to therapy.

RESULTS The literature search yielded 25 articles.
After full review of the articles, 14 studies met all inclu-
sion criteria.10–23 Two studies were excluded as they
discussed extratumoral findings (i.e., incidental find-
ings on WB-MRI in NF or marrow changes in patients
with NF treated with imatinib mesylate22,23). Hence,
the final analysis included 12 studies.10–21

performed with slice thickness of 5 mm.13 Three of
the 12 studies used contrast material as an adjunct to
traditional WB-MRI fluid-sensitive sequences.11,13,14 One
study obtained postcontrast 3D volumetric gradient echo
images13 while the other study obtained 2D spin echo

investigators found contrast to be useful in distinguishing
PNST from perineural cysts.13

WB-MRI applications. With respect to image interpreta-
tion and analysis, the following aspects were specifically
assessed: tumor detection (evaluation of WB tumor
burden, including tumor size), tumor characterization,

and the assessment of treatment response (table 2).
There are varied methods of WB tumor burden eval-
uation, with recent studies favoring 3D tumor volu-
metry, rather than 1D or 2D linear measurements
(such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
[RECIST]). Five of the 12 published investigations in
this study utilized MedX software (v3.42; Sensor Sys-
tems, Inc., Sterling, VA), a semi-automated method
for segmentation and measurement with a heuristics-
based algorithm for volumetric analysis,14,15,17,18,21
while 5 of the 12 publications used a computerized
3D-volumetry method developed for WB-MRI using
the dynamic threshold level set method.10–12,16,19 There
are limited data with regards to characterization of

Internal tumor burden is not a primary
contributor to QOL but it does
correlate with SF-36 bodily pain score

Higher number of internal PNs and
a greater whole-body PN volume are
important risk factors for the
development of MPNST

NF1 patients with deep tumors and
tumors within the trunk are more likely to
have metabolically avid (SUVmax greater
than 2.5) PNST; increased PNST size,
location, and plexiform appearance were
associated with increased odds of having
a metabolically active PNST

WB-MRI with volumetric sequences is
feasible for detection of PNST in NF;
addition of DWI and contrast enables
potential for characterization of cysts
vs tumors; cysts lack enhancement
and have higher ADC values

Although PET/CT has a higher
sensitivity on a per lesion basis for
characterization of PNST as benign or
malignant, addition of WB-MRI may
decrease the FP rate

Whole-body PNST volume at the time
of the initial WB-MRI correlated with
the absolute rate of PNST growth; new
PNST are infrequent in patients with
NF1 with PNST and unlikely in patients
without PNST

Patients with SWN had the highest
prevalence of PNST, but patients with
NF1 had the highest median tumor

Future directions for whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) investigations in
patients with neurofibromatosis (NF)

Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of WB-MRI in NF

1. Comparative study of 3.0T vs 1.5T for tumor detection

2. Comparative study for 2D vs 3D acquisition for tumor detection

3. Comparative study of axial vs coronal imaging acquisition for tumor detection

4. Comparative study of regional vs WB-MRI for tumor detection

5. Test retest variability and interobserver performance of WB-MRI in NF

6. Determination of the minimally meaningful clinical change of tumor size with WB-MRI

Biologic characterization of tumor

1. Investigate functional MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient

mapping) vs other imaging modalities such as fluorodeoxyglucose PET for tumor
characterization and assessment of treatment response

2. Investigate the added value of contrast-enhanced imaging to WB-MRI protocol for

characterization and assessment of treatment response

for assessment of treatment response, although such
analysis is ongoing in a clinical trial assessing WB-
MRI over time in people with NF2 treated with
bevacizumab (NCT01207687).

The data from tables 1 and 2 were critically evalu-
ated to generate knowledge gaps and future directions
for WB-MRI investigations to provide the required
metrics for inclusion of WB-MRI as a primary end-
point in clinical trials for NF-associated PNST. Priority
areas identified include WB-MRI reproducibility for
anatomical measures, optimal analysis techniques, and
establishing the minimal meaningful clinical difference
in tumor size (table 3).

DISCUSSION WB-MRI provides continuous cover-
age of lesions that cross anatomical boundaries and
therefore cannot be fully imaged with localized MRI,
a significant advantage when evaluating patients with
NF syndromes where there are frequently large infiltra-
tive tumors (figure) or multifocal PNST, which may be
missed without WB-MRI assessment.21 In this setting,
WB-MRI allows assessment of differential response
within and across tumors over time. An additional
advantage is that WB-MRI can be completed with
a typical scan time of 45–60 minutes on both 1.5T
and 3.0T systems and uses the same protocols for
patients of all ages, allowing continuity across and
within patients enrolled in a therapeutic trial.12,13,18

A major goal of this work was to identify core as-
pects of WB-MRI application for assessment of NF-
associated PNST to enable inclusion of WB-MRI as
a primary endpoint for therapeutic trials of NF-
associated PNST. There are no comparative data
available with respect to magnet strength,
image
acquisition plane (axial vs coronal), 2D or 3D acqui-
sition, or the value of functional imaging and admin-
istration of contrast material available across all
available investigations. However, after the analyses

of the WB-MRI studies in patients with NF con-
ducted to date, several statements can be made:
WB-MRI in NF is feasible both at 1.5T or 3.0T; it
can be standardized across multiple sites for anatomic
tumor assessment in the setting of a clinical trial; both
2D and 3D acquisition are operational for generating
tumor data; STIR is a core sequence for evaluation of
tumor burden; and functional sequences such as
DWI can be considered in the setting of WB-MRI.
Outside of these statements, the WB-MRI Working
Group of REiNS is not able to make specific recom-
mendations for acquisition protocols at this time due
to a lack of data. For example, only a single case series
of 4 patients compared analysis of tumor burden in
patients with NF1 who underwent WB-MRI on both
1.5T and 3.0T within a 6-month period.24 This study
showed no difference in tumor volumes between the
2 magnet strengths; however, there are no other com-
parative analyses and this study is too small to draw
conclusions. The majority of studies completed to
date use 1.5T as this is more widely available. The
wide availability of 1.5T magnets is an advantage for
application of WB-MRI to multicenter trials. How-
ever, 3.0T WB-MRI has theoretical advantages, such
as increased signal to noise ratios (SNR), allowing for
improved 3D sequences as well as allowing for DWI
acquisition in an acceptable imaging time. Potential
disadvantages of 3.0T MRI include B1 field inhomo-
geneities and susceptibility artifacts.2,13 Work is ongo-
ing to optimize this with technological advances such as
continuous table motion and improved coils, which are
expected to shorten acquisition and increase SNR.2,25
the STIR
sequence, with its combined T1 and T2 weighting,
has been uniformly used in the WB-MRI investigations
for PNST. Most pathologic processes, including tu-
mors, are proton-rich with resultant prolonged T1
and T2 relaxation times and increased signal intensity
on STIR images. In addition, fat suppression is more
robust and homogeneous on inversion recovery sequen-
ces than other frequency selective sequences. These fea-
tures make the STIR sequence valuable for detection
and measurement of PNST and a core sequence for
assessment of whole body tumor burden in NF. How-
ever, detection of other pathologies in the viscera or the
skeletal system may require additional imaging.

to specific sequences,

With respect

Regarding 2D and 3D acquisitions, 11 of the 12
studies used 2D imaging sequences,10–12,14–21 while on-
ly 1 study (at 3.0T) obtained images with 3D volu-
metric sequences.13 This allows us to say that both are
feasible, but there are no data to suggest advantages of
one over the other. There are important differences in
spatial resolution between 2D and 3D sequences. For
2D sequences obtained at 1.5T, the in-plane resolution
can be 0.3–1.5 mm and the slice thickness can range
from 5 to 10 mm with no interslice gap. WB-MRI at

this resolution may not be adequate for the detection
or characterization of very small neoplasms and PNST
located in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. 3D
sequences obtained at 3.0T can have an interpolated
spatial resolution of 2 mm with slice thickness of 2 mm
and no interslice gap.13 Both 2D and 3D sequences can
also be performed with higher spatial resolution, but at
the cost of longer acquisition time. A potential advan-
tage of 3D sequences includes MPR capabilities such
that a 3D isotropic dataset can be displayed in any
imaging plane. However, 3D acquisition may not be
available on all scanners, limiting application in mul-
ticenter studies.

regarding an optimal

For both 2D and 3D sequences, there is a lack of
consensus
imaging plane.
Although all WB-MRI investigations to date have
included the coronal plane, no comparative study
has been performed to determine the ideal imaging
plane. An advantage of coronal image acquisition is
that for anatomic sequences such as STIR or T1-
weigted imaging, there is less respiratory motion
due to faster image acquisition. Of note, the coronal
image acquisition may not be optimal for DWI, par-
ticularly in the neck and thoracic regions, due to car-
diac motion.

There is also a lack of data regarding the added
value of IV contrast material. Use of exogenous con-
trast requires venous access and hemodynamic mon-
itoring during the WB-MRI acquisition that may
reduce feasibility and carries the additional risk of
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in the setting of renal
failure. New literature also suggests a relationship
between repetitive gadolinium exposure and high sig-
nal intensity in the basal ganglia, further raising con-
cern about exogenous contrast.26 There are currently
insufficient data to assess the potential diagnostic ben-
efit vs risk of the use of IV contrast for PNST. Finally,
no investigations have been performed to assess the
added value of DWI with ADC maps to standard
sequences in WB-MRI in patients with NF. This is
feasible and the potential advantages include the
assessment of tumor biology and possibly treatment
response, the ability to distinguish a cyst from a neo-
plasm, and the characterization of incidental findings.
For example, specific threshold ADC values enable
distinguishing soft tissue masses from cysts with high
specificity (100%),
important when quantifying
tumor burden.13,27 Similarly, there is localized MRI
experience using DWI and ADC mapping for PNST
characterization as benign or malignant with 100%
sensitivity (95% confidence interval 66.4%–100%)
and 77% specificity.28 There is also limited experi-
ence comparing WB-MRI with whole body 18F-flu-
orodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT for characterizing
PNST as benign or malignant.14 Although 18F-FDG
PET/CT had higher sensitivity (100%) compared

with WB-MRI (66.7%) on a per lesion basis, WB-
MRI had a higher specificity (97% for WB-MRI vs
74.4% for 18F-FDG PET/CT) for detecting malig-
nancy.14 WB-MRI in this particular investigation
used routine anatomic sequences only,14 and thus it
remains to be determined whether addition of quan-
titative functional MRI sequences with ADC meas-
urements would alter the diagnostic accuracy for
detection of malignancy.

Although WB-MRI with functional sequences for
detection and characterization of benign vs malignant
PNST shows promise, currently these sequences can
be difficult to perform uniformly across multiple sites.
No investigations have been published to date regard-
ing the assessment of treatment response in PNST in
NF, but there are efforts currently for analysis of
ongoing therapeutic studies with pretreatment and
posttreatment WB-MRI
(NCT01207687). This
study will also allow assessment of the added value
of functional MRI or contrast-enhanced sequences
for assessing changes in tumor biology independent
of changes in tumor size.

With respect to WB-MRI analysis, the field has rec-
ommended volumetric measurements of tumor rather
than 2D measures.29–31 Tumor volumetry is preferred
for quantifying complex PNST such as plexiform neu-
rofibromas that can be large and infiltrative whereas
2D or linear measurement is more likely to misrepre-
sent the true tumor dimensions by overestimating or
underestimating PNST size and can be fraught with
interobserver and intraobserver variations.32–34 Tumor
volumetry, particularly in infiltrative plexiform neo-
plasms such as the ones identified in patients with
NF syndromes, has become the optimal approach for
assessing tumor burden. In addition, the current ther-
apeutic trials in NF syndromes use volumetric analysis
as a primary or secondary endpoint (NCT01362803,
NCT02101736, NCT02096471). Volumetric tumor
burden can be measured manually, though this is time-
consuming and impractical for routine clinical evalua-
tion. Computer-aided tumor segmentation of PNST
can be performed on MRI sequences that show clear
distinction between tumor and surrounding normal
tissue, such as STIR or similar fluid sensitive sequen-
ces. In one study comparing manual and semi-
automated tumor volumetry, computerized volumetry
using a dynamic threshold method was superior to
manual segmentation techniques.19 Moreover, com-
puterized volumetry was reliable and less labor inten-
sive, which made it more repeatable compared to
manual segmentation.19 It is important to note that
reliability and repeatability were calculated using a small
sample size19; however, this technique has subse-
quently been applied in larger studies of approximately
250 patients.10–12 A multicenter study comparing the 2
principal semi-automated methods for reliability and

interpretation time compared with the manual tech-
nique in lesion detection and change in lesion size is
currently underway.

Although there are several advantages to WB-MRI
for NF, there are also important limitations. First, for
very tall or large individuals, portions of the body may
not be adequately imaged, including the distal legs,
shoulders, and arms. Adequate imaging of the distal
lower extremities is a particular concern for 3.0T
scanners and may limit the use of WB-MRI if there
are tumors of interest in these regions. This can be ad-
dressed by imaging the upper and lower body sepa-
rately; however, this increases cost and time. An
additional concern for tumor assessment with WB-
MRI is that the lower limit of tumor volume that
can be assessed has not been described, and depend-
ing on the WB-MRI technique as well as the tumor
distribution, the cutoff value may be variable. Select-
ing the same PNST for contouring consistently over
consecutive scans is crucial
for determining size
change and can only be done on comparable quality
image sets. Similarly, diagnostic performance of
WB-MRI for total tumor burden estimates is depen-
dent on the correct representation of the body on the
MRI and needs to be standardized across sites and
time points. Importantly, WB-MRI can suffer from
varied image distortions at the periphery of the imag-
ing field, which may lead to measurement errors.13
Given spatial resolution limitations and depending
on what sequences are applied, additional dedicated
MRI sequences such as magnetic resonance neurog-
raphy may be necessary to provide improved ana-
tomic and functional characterization of PNST,35
evaluate tumors in and around the spinal cord, iden-
tify small tumors such as pheochromocytomas, or
diagnose vascular anomalies. Finally, it is worth not-
ing that there are some limitations to the analysis
presented based on the very limited literature on this
topic. Only 14 investigations fulfilled search criteria.
Of these, several studies had overlapping patient data
and WB-MRI protocols reported with separate end-
points.10,16,19 This further highlights the need for
additional research on WB-MRI performance in
NF syndromes (table 3).

Choosing standardized image acquisition and
analysis methods is essential for optimal multicenter
collaboration applying WB-MRI as a tool for assess-
ing tumors in NF. WB-MRI may serve as either a pri-
mary or secondary endpoint in clinical drug trials that
target multiple tumors requiring systemic rather than
localized imaging. The systematic process developed
by the REiNS WB-MRI Working Group has enabled
a multicenter conversation about imaging protocols
and the development of future comparative projects.
These results will be used by the group to identify
the most appropriate WB-MRI acquisition and

interpretation methods for individuals with NF syn-
dromes in future clinical trials and prioritize research
questions about the optimal use of WB-MRI as an
endpoint measure in NF research.
