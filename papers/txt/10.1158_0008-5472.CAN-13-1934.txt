Abstract

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal disorder that affects neural crest-derived tissues,
leading to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Patients commonly present with plexiform
neurofibromas, benign but debilitating growths that can transform into malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a main cause of mortality. Currently, surgery is the primary course of
treatment for MPNST, but with the limitation that these tumors are highly invasive. Radiation
therapy is another treatment option, but is undesirable because it can induce additional mutations.
MPNST patients may also receive doxorubicin as therapy, but this DNA-intercalating agent has
relatively low tumor specificity and limited efficacy. In this study, we exploited a robust
genetically-engineered mouse model of MPNST that recapitulates human NF1 associated MPNST
to identify a novel small chemical compound that inhibits tumor cell growth. Compound 21
(Cpd21) inhibits growth of all available in vitro models of MPNST and human MPNST cell lines,
while remaining non-toxic to normally-dividing Schwann cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
We show that this compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular apoptosis. Moreover,
Cpd21 can reduce MPNST burden in a mouse allograft model, underscoring the compound’s
potential as a novel chemotherapeutic agent.

Introduction

Page 2

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects 1 in
3500 people (1). Patients typically present with a constellation of signs, including café-au-
lait pigmentation spots, benign neurofibromas, axillary or inguinal freckling, optic gliomas,
Lisch nodules in the eye, bone abnormalities, and multiple additional less penetrant
manifestations (2). Furthermore, NF1 patients are predisposed to malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (3), which are a significant source of mortality.

Neurofibromas are benign tumors that grow on the skin (dermal) or inside the body
(plexiform) (4). Neurofibromas have complex cellularity including Schwann lineage cells,
fibroblasts, perineurial cells, mast cells, collagen deposits, and physical proximity to
peripheral nerves. Plexiform neurofibromas appear in 30% of NF1 patients (5), and although
they retain the capacity to enlarge throughout life, many lines of evidence point to an
embryonic origin (4). Dermal neurofibromas can arise from a type of adult stem cell called
skin-derived precursors (SKPs) (4), while plexiform neurofibromas arise from embryonic
neural crest lineage Schwann cell progenitors (6). Whether the two cell types are related or
the same remains unclear (7).

NF1 patients can also develop malignant tumors, including leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma
and neuroblastoma in children (2). The most common malignancy, however, is MPNST,
which arises from and appears in, approximately 9–21% of patients with plexiform
neurofibromas (8). MPNSTs are initially difficult to detect, metastasize widely, and have a
poor prognosis (9). Mutation of Nf1, which encodes a RAS-GTPase activating enzyme (10),
is known to activate RAS downstream effectors including the ERK, PI3K, and mTOR
pathways (11–15). The two most common cancer-associated mutations present in MPNSTs
in addition to Nf1 mutation are the tumor suppressors p53 (16–18) and CDKN2 (16, 19–23).
Mice harboring mutated Nf1 and p53 or Nf1 and Cdkn2 spontaneously develop MPNST (24,
25). In addition to Nf1 and its downstream effector Ras, the conditional deletion of Pten also
leads to MPNST in mice (26).

In this study, we exploit a robust, model of MPNST that histologically and molecularly
recapitulates human MPNST. We used primary cells from these MPNSTs to screen for
compounds that specifically arrest tumor cell growth. Such compounds would not only have
potential as a platform for novel therapeutic development but also for probing the biology of
MPNST. Elucidating the mechanism of action of such compounds could identify MPNST
specific pathways and point to therapeutic opportunities. We report a novel small molecule,
compound 21 (Cpd21 or identification number SW106065), which induces apoptosis in all
models of MPNST tested but spares normal cells and tissues. Moreover, we demonstrate that
this compound can decrease the tumor burden of MPNST in a mouse allograft model.

Methods
Cell and Tissue Samples

S462 and SNF96.2 cells were a gift from Karen Cichowski. Schwann cells (ScienCell) were
cultured in Schwann Cell Medium (ScienCell), and were immortalized with Myc-retrovirus
(27).

High-throughput screening

sMPNST and Schwann cells (400 cells/well) were seeded in 384-well plates, and grown
overnight. Compounds (final concentration of 2.5 µM) were added and incubated for 96h.
CellTiter-Glo™ (Promega) was added, and luminescence was quantified using Envision
2102 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer).

Soft Agar Assay

Page 3

A cellular layer of 0.6% Bacto-agar in MPNST media was plated. Cells were trypsinized,
pelleted, resuspended, mixed in 1:1 ratio with 0.6% agar to a final density of 1 × 104 cells/
mL, and plated on top. After incubation for 10 days, colonies were stained with 0.5 mL
0.005% crystal violet.

Cell Cycle Analysis

BrdU (10 µM) was added to cells for 30 min. Cells were collected, resuspended in 100 uL
PBS, fixed in 5 mL ice cold ethanol, and then stored overnight at 4°C. 2N HCl/Triton X-100
was added to denature DNA. After neutralization, samples were incubated with 50 uL 0.5%
Tween 20/1%BSA/PBS, 20 uL anti-BrdU-FITC (BD Biosciences), and 5 uL of 10 mg/mL
RNAse overnight. Samples were pelleted, resuspended in 1 mL 5 ug/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma), and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Western Blotting

Cells were collected, trypsinized, and lysed with 600 uL RIPA buffer. Samples were run on
5–20% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad). The following primary antibodies were used: Cyclin D1,
H3 (Millipore), Caspase 3, pERK, ERK, pAKT, AKT (Cell Signaling), PARP (Novus
Biologicals and Millipore), αTubulin (Sigma), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz).

Annexin V Staining

Floating and adherent cells were resuspended in Binding Buffer (0.01 M Hepes/NaOH (pH
7.4), 0.14 M NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2), and processed according to manufacturer (MACS
Miltenyi Biotec). 300 uL of suspension was added to 5 uL Annexin V antibody (MACS
Miltenyi Biotec) and 2.5 uL propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Metabolic Stability Studies

Cpd21 levels for metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic studies were monitored by LC-
MS/MS with AB/Sciex (Applied Biosystems) 3200 Qtrap mass spectrometer coupled to
Shimadzu Prominence LC. Cpd21 was detected with the mass spectrometer in positive
MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode by following the precursor to fragment ion
transition 205.0 to 111.1. An Agilent C18 XDB 5 micron packing column (50 × 4.6 mm)
was used for chromatography. For S9 studies, Cpd21 (2 µM) was incubated in a 1 mL
incubation volume with 1 mg of murine CD-1 S9 (combined cytosol and microsome)
fractions (Celsis/In Vitro Technologies) and Phase I (the NADPH regenerating system)
cofactors (Sigma) for 0–240 min. Reactions were quenched by mixing the incubation
mixture with 1 mL of methanol/0.2 ng/µL n-benzylbenzamide/0.2% formic acid. The
quenched mixture was vortexed for 15 s, incubated at RT for 10 min and spun for 5 min at
986×g. Supernatants were spun in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 5 min at 16,100×g. The
second supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

Pharmacokinetic Studies

6–7 week old NCR-nu/nu female mice were implanted with 2.5×105 MPNST cells in the left
flank, subcutaneously. When tumors reached 800 mm3, animals were injected with Cpd21 at
20 mg/kg in 0.2 ml 10% ethanol, 10% PEG400, 80% of a solution of 5% dextrose, pH 7.4.
Blood was drawn at 0, 10, 30, 60, 180, 360, 1440 min using the anticoagulant, ACD
(acidified citrate dextrose) and plasma isolated by centrifugation. 100 µL plasma was mixed
with 200 µL acetonitrile containing 0.15% formic acid and 37.5 ng/mL n-benzylbenzamide
IS. Samples were vortexed 15 s, incubated at RT for 10 min and spun twice at 16,100×g at
4°C. Amount of Cpd21 present in plasma was quantified by LC-MS/MS to determine the
rate of clearance from mouse blood. A Cpd21 standard curve was generated using blank

plasma spiked with known Cpd21 concentrations and processed as described above.
Concentrations of Cpd21in each time-point sample were quantified using Analyst 1.4.2. The
limit of detection (LOD) was defined as 3-fold above the signal obtained from blank plasma.
The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was defined as the lowest concentration at which back
calculation yielded a concentration within 20% of theoretical. The LOQ for plasma was 5
ng/mL and 1 ng/mL for tumor. Back-calculation of points on the standard curve yielded
values within 15% of theoretical over 4 orders of magnitude (5000 to 5 or 1 ng/mL).
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the noncompartmental analysis tool of
WinNonLin (Pharsight).

Bioluminescent Imaging

sMPNST-luc+ cells (2×505 cells/200 uL) were injected in both flanks of nude mice. Mice
were injected with 40 mg/kg Cpd21 or vehicle (10% ethanol, 10% PEG400, and 80% of 5%
dextrose in water) IP twice per day for 4 weeks. Mice were injected with 160 uL 20 mg/mL
D-Luciferin Potassium Salt (Perkin Elmer) in 0.9% sterile NaCl, and total flux was
quantified using IVIS Lumina II (Caliper Life Sciences) weekly.

Immunohistochemistry

Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. After sectioning,
immunohistochemical studies were performed as previously described (29). The following
primary antibodies were used: S100 (28), GAP43 (Abcam), Ki67 (Thermo Scientific),
Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), and PARP (Novus Biologicals).

Results
Nf1 and p53 deficient Skin-Derived Precursors (SKPs) form MPNST

NF1-associated dermal and plexiform neurofibromas are histologically compatible despite
having significantly different natural history and tumor progression properties. Recently, we
reported that SKPs are the cell-of-origin of dermal neurofibromas (4). Given the potential in
mice for neural crest progenitors to give rise to MPNST after additional loss of the p53
tumor suppressor, we tested the consequences of dual Nf1 and p53 loss of function (NP) in
SKPs. SKPs from mice with Nf1f/f;p53f/f genotype were cultured and infected with
adenovirus containing Cre-GFP (Ad-Cre) to induce tumor suppressor recombination (30)
(Figure 1Aa). The majority of infected cells displayed green fluorescence, indicating
effective viral entry and expression (Figure 1Ab). We confirmed effective Cre-mediated
recombination of all floxed alleles by PCR analysis (Figure 1Ab).

The Nf1−/−;p53−/− cells (NP SKPs) were reimplanted into the same mouse from which they
were derived (autograft) and highly aggressive, malignant tumors developed in all cases
(Figure 1Ac). These tumors could be successfully cultured as either spheres or adherent cells
(data not shown), or allografted into nude mice (Figure 1Ad). These tumors (termed
sMPNST, for SKP derived MPNST) were assayed for human MPNST-associated genes
including embryonic Schwann cell markers, S100 (24, 25), Krox20 (6), PLP (31), and
GAP43 (32, 33); developing glia marker, Dhh (34); and neural-crest-associated marker,
snail (35). The RT-qPCR data demonstrated expression of all markers in all sMPNSTs
analyzed (Figure 1Ae). Thus, sMPNSTs exhibit molecular characteristics of human NF1
associated MPNST.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of sMPNSTs showed presence of spindle-shaped
cells that interweave in a poorly-differentiated, wavy appearance, reminiscent of human
MPNST histology (Figure 1Ba). Additionally, the commonly used MPNST markers, S100
and GAP43, were present (Figure 1Bb–1Be). Therefore, our results indicate that SKPs, cells

that give rise to neurofibromas upon loss of Nf1, can also give rise to MPNST with
additional loss of p53. The facility of generating and explanting sMPNSTs made this a
favorable system for performing chemical compound screens.

Novel MPNST inhibitory Small Molecule

We hold the concern that over time in culture, tumor cells will drift from their original
intrinsic cellular and molecular programs in unpredictable ways. These uncontrollable and
unmeasurable changes may inadvertently alter fundamental properties of the original tumor
cells. To mitigate these concerns, the relative facility of generating primary cultures from
sMPNSTs afforded the advantage of propagating sufficient numbers of cells for a high-
throughput screening while keeping the cell passage number low. We performed a limited
high-throughput, small-molecule screen using sMPNST cells produced above in an
extension of a related ongoing large scale screen in our research group. We carried out a
200,000 compound screen on primary mouse glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells that are
deficient for Nf1, p53, and Pten (KL and LFP, unpublished data). This original GBM screen
yielded 4480 compounds, identified as inhibitory to GBM cell growth. We reasoned that
since sMPNST cells are deficient in two of these same tumor suppressors, some compounds
might have conserved sMPNST cell growth inhibitory properties.

A well-established luminescence assay for measuring ATP levels (an indication of cellular
metabolic activity) was adopted (CellTiter-Glo™, Promega), and performed 96 hours after
compound exposure. 1515 compounds exhibited a greater than 20% decrease in ATP levels
at 2.5 µM (Figure 2A and 2B). To exclude compounds that exert general cell toxicity, or
perturb the generic cell cycle or mitotic machinery, we counter-screened the 1515
compounds against Myc-immortalized Schwann cells (27, 36) and eliminated compounds
that showed greater than 20% lower ATP levels. The resultant 119 compounds were
rescreened on sMPNSTs with a cutoff at 70% inhibition. 28 compounds passed this test and
were further tested in dose response studies ranging from 125 nM to 20 µM. The twenty-first
compound (Figure 2C) (Cpd21 or SW106065) inhibited ATP consumption of sMPNST and
all other models of MPNST tested (Figure 2D) with an EC50 of 1 µM. We extended the
functional analysis of Cpd21 to additional cell lines. Human MPNST cell lines, S462
(Figure 2E) and SNF96.2 (Figure 2F), were assayed for dose-dependent growth, and EC50
concentrations of 439.0 and 753.6 nM, respectively, were determined. In contrast, NIH3T3
cells and wildtype Schwann cells showed a considerably higher dose resistance (Figure 2G).
We also tested sMPNST response to Cpd21 in anchorage-independent soft agar growth
assays and found that Cpd21 inhibited colony formation (Figure 2H and 2I). This effect was
also observed in MPNST cells derived from cis-Nf1+/−;p53+/− mice (Figure 2J and 2K).
Thus Cpd21 has general toxic activity on Nf1 and p53 deficient MPNST cells but not on
diverse non-tumorigenic, mitotically active fibroblasts or Schwann cells.

Cpd21 Delays the Cell Cycle in sMPNST

To address the mechanism of action of Cpd21, we treated sMPNST cells at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5,
and 5 µM for 24 h, and pulsed with BrdU for 30 min. Subsequent flow cytometry analysis
revealed a decreased percentage of cells in S phase, and a corresponding increased
percentage in G1/G0 and G2/M, compared to treatment with DMSO alone (Figure 3A).

Several cell cycle regulatory genes exhibited decreased mRNA in the presence of Cpd21
including: cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk4, and cdk6 (Figure 3B and 3C).
Increased levels of cdkn1a and cdkn2a mRNA were observed in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3D). Also, levels of Cyclin D1 protein, which is known to interact with cdk4/6 in
regulating G1/S progression, were decreased (37, 38) (Figure 3E). These results indicate that

following Cpd21 exposure, cells in S phase are underrepresented, consistent with cell cycle
delay and an arrest of the mitotic machinery.

We examined Cpd21-treated sMPNST cells for apoptosis by annexin V-FITC-conjugated
flow cytometry. Tumor cells treated with Cpd21 concentrations at or above 0.5 µM showed
a statistically-significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 4A). At the
EC50 concentration of 1 µM, 11.23±1.56% of the cells were annexin V positive, compared
to 5.02% ± 0.83% in DMSO-treated control cells.

We also performed Western blotting of Cpd21-treated sMPNST cells and observed Caspase
3 (Figure 4B) and PARP (Figure 4C) cleavage, consistent with induced apoptosis. We
further validated this mechanism in MPNST cells cultured from spontaneous MPNSTs from
our cis-Nf1+/−;p53+/− mouse model (Figure 4D), and in the human MPNST cell line, S462
(Figure 4E). Other cell types, including Myc-immortalized Schwann cells (Figure 4F) and
MEF cells (Figure 4G) did not undergo caspase 3 cleavage. Together, these data indicate
that, in vitro, Cpd21 induced mitotic arrest of MPNST cells that ultimately results in cellular
apoptosis, and that this phenotype was not observed in untransformed dividing cells.

Cpd21 Decreases Tumor Burden and Induces Apoptosis in vivo

To determine whether Cpd21 could be directly tested in vivo, we sought to define the
metabolic properties in vitro according to previously published methods (39, 40). To
examine stability, Cpd21 was incubated with purified, hepatic, enzymatic S9 fraction over a
period of 240 min, and measured over time (Figure 5A). The half-life in the S9 fraction is
22.65 min. We also incubated Cpd21 with cultured hepatocytes and found that the half-life
is 121.6 min (Figure 5B). These assays demonstrate that Cpd21 would have reasonable
stability in vivo.

We next sought to define the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of Cpd21 according to
previously published methods (40). sMPNST (2.5 × 105) cells were injected subcutaneously
into nude mice, and when tumors reached 800 mm3, a single dose of Cpd21 was injected IP
at 20 mg/kg. Plasma and tumor samples were collected after 10, 30, 90, 180, 360, and 960
min and assayed by mass spectrometry (Figure 5C). We observed that Cpd21 rapidly
distributes from the plasma into sMPNST tissues, and that the half-life in sMPNST tissues is
6–8 hours once the compound is completely distributed. Importantly, Cpd21 concentration
remains above the EC50 concentration of 1 µM (204 ng/mL) in the sMPNSTs for over 6
hours. These results indicate that Cpd21 is successfully delivered to the tumor tissue in
adequate concentrations and with an adequate half-life for in vivo studies.

We next determined a dose tolerable for chronic in vivo administration of Cpd21. Cpd21
dissolved in a mixture of ethanol, PEG400, and dextrose was delivered intraperitoneally (IP)
at 20 or 40 mg/kg twice per day, into nude mice over the course of two weeks for
comparison with vehicle administration. These concentrations were selected because 40 mg/
kg is the maximum solubility in the aforementioned formulation. Over this period, the mice
were weighed daily and observed for signs of toxicity. Neither concentration of Cpd21
produced measurable weight loss or distress in the mice (data not shown). Therefore, we
selected 40 mg/kg twice per day IP as the dosing regimen for efficacy studies.

We then tested the effects of Cpd21 administration on tumor burden in vivo. Nude mice
were injected with sMPNST cells carrying a luciferase gene (MPNST-luc+) to permit non-
invasive in vivo tumor growth assessment by luminescence. One week after allograft,
recipient mice were IP injected with either 40 mg/kg of Cpd21 or vehicle twice daily over 4
weeks, and mice were imaged weekly. We observed that treatment with Cpd21 reduced the

tumor burden as measured by total flux normalized to baseline flux levels (Figure 5D and
5E).

BrdU was injected into mice prior to necropsy. Both BrdU and Ki67 evaluation indicated a
significant decrease in tumor cell proliferation following Cpd21 treatment (Figure 5F–5I).
These results are consistent with our observations that Cpd21 inhibits the cell cycle in vitro,
resulting in a decrease in the proliferative capacity of sMPNSTs.

Consistent with in vitro data, Cpd21-treated sMPNSTs exhibited elevated activated caspase
3 and PARP (Figure 5J–5M). These results were confirmed by Western blotting to detect
cleaved caspase 3 and PARP in tumors from our in vivo model (Figure 5N). Taken together,
our results demonstrate that Cpd21 can be delivered to mice in concentrations to sufficiently
penetrate sMPNST tissue, and inhibit tumor development.

To extend the previous observation that chronic Cpd21 exposure did not appear to cause
general toxicity, we examined various tissues following necropsy for histological evidence
of Cpd21 induced toxicity. In addition to tumor tissue (Figure 6A), we examined liver
(Figure 6B), kidney (Figure 6C), brain (Figure 6D), skin (Figure 6E), and sciatic nerve
(Figure 6F), and found no evidence of abnormal histology. Activated caspase 3 could only
be detected in tumor samples (Figure 6G) and not in other tissues examined (Figure 6H–L).
In contrast to other chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin that induce toxicity in a
variety of tissues (41), Cpd21 appears to act most notably on malignant tumor tissue.

Interaction with Other Anticancer Agents

In addition to doxorubicin, MPNSTs have been shown to be sensitive to pathway-specific
inhibitors of MAPK/ERK (42), PI3K/AKT (43), mTOR (43–45), and CXCR4 (7). We
therefore examined whether Cpd21 in conjunction with doxorubicin or specific inhibitors,
including U0126, a MEK inhibitor (42); LY294002, an AKT inhibitor (43); rapamycin, an
mTOR inhibitor (43–45); and AMD3100, a CXCR4 inhibitor (7), might better inhibit
sMPNST cell growth as assessed by ATP consumption (46). We found the inhibition of the
PI3K pathway combined with Cpd21 treatment resulted in a decrease in cellular growth and
survival that is greater than either inhibitor alone (Figure 7A and 7B). Phospho-AKT
Western blots of sMPNST cells treated with LY294002 at 20 µM for 30 or 60 minutes
verified effective pAKT inhibition in sMPNST cells (Figure 7C). Inhibition of the MEK/
ERK pathway combined with Cpd21 treatment did not produce detectable additive or
synergistic effects (Figure 7D). Phospho-ERK inhibition by U0126 was verified by Western
blotting (Figure 7E). Inhibition of the mTOR pathway combined with Cpd21 treatment did
not produce detectable additive or synergistic effects (Figure 7F). In fact, sMPNST cellular
growth seemed relatively resistant to rapamycin, despite exhibiting decreased pS6 levels
after rapamycin treatment (Figure 7G). None of the other tested reagents produced
measurable additive or synergistic effects (data not shown). We extended the above studies
of dual LY294002 and Cpd21 treatment to MPNST cells derived from cis-Nf1+/−;p53+/−
mice, and again, the combined effect of both inhibitors is greater than that of each individual
inhibitor (Figure 7H). We tested the effects of both inhibitors on phosphorylation of AKT,
and found that pAKT was inhibited only when LY294002 is present (Figure 7C and 7I).
Thus, in contrast to published reports of successful application of MEK inhibitors to
suppress NF1 based solid tumors and leukemias, in the context of Cp21, co-inhibition of the
PI3K pathway was most effective in impeding tumor cell growth and survival.

Discussion

Malignant peripheral nerve tumors are the major source of mortality in NF1. Like most
malignant sarcomas, these tumors are resistant to all current chemotherapeutic and

radiotherapeutic strategies. It has long been recognized that MPNSTs harbor tumor
suppressor mutations in addition to Nf1 loss. Notably, loss-of-function mutations of the p53
tumor suppressor have been reported (16–18). This has led to the successful generation of
spontaneous mouse models of MPNST by mutation of both Nf1 and p53 tumor suppressor
genes (24, 25). A further refinement of MPNST modeling came about by identifying SKPs
as a source for dermal neurofibromas in the skin and by the capacity of SKPs to engender
plexiform neurofibromas when placed in the sciatic nerve (4). Additive mutation of p53
together with Nf1 turned SKPs into progenitors of MPNST, thus facilitating high throughput
screens for chemical compounds that might inhibit early passage cell growth.

We identified Cpd21 as a small molecule with inhibitory properties on cultured mouse and
human MPNST cells. It was a surprise that this compound originating from a 200,000
chemical compound library, had, without chemical modification a repertoire of desirable in
vivo properties including low micromolar EC50, adequate stability, manageable toxicity, and
adequate accumulation in solid tumor tissue. These serendipitous favorable properties
allowed allograft analysis of antitumor efficacy and demonstrated a significant reduction in
tumor burden by this compound. Future efforts to assess the effectiveness of Cp21 on human
MPNST xenografts will provide additional insight into the potential for this compound as a
therapeutic agent.

At present we cannot identify the specific mechanism whereby Cpd21 exerts its inhibitory
action on MPNST cells. Compound exposure to tumor cells results in a cell cycle delay
manifested by depletion of certain cell cycle related molecules and eventually leading to
cellular apoptosis. A similar course of events is seen when tumor-bearing mice are treated
with compound. However, the precise molecular target and mechanistic mode of compound
action remains a topic of investigation. Empirical chemical compound screens to identify
cancer cell inhibitory compounds have been applied for several decades. A significant
proportion of such empirically derived cancer cell inhibitory small molecules that have
reached the clinic, have turned out to mechanistically impinge on various aspects of cell
division including mitotic spindle machinery, cell cycle machinery and DNA replication and
repair machinery. These cellular properties are not unique to cancer cells and are shared by
many normally dividing cells in the body that are essential for organ health.
Chemotherapeutic toxicity to normal cells represents a major impediment to effective cancer
treatment. In this regard, our screen departs from traditional high throughput screens in that
we limited our cells assayed to early passage cells rather than to established cell lines. It is
also noteworthy that the cellular specificity of Cpd21 renders it relatively innocuous to the
normally dividing cells we tested (MEFs, Myc-Schwann Cells, and wildtype SKPs). This
feature is consistent with the idea that the compound target(s) relates to the “cancer state” of
the MPNST cells rather than to more general properties of mitotically active cells. Although
we currently do not know whether Cpd21 is also effective against the benign plexiform
neurofibromas, it is entirely possible that these slowly-dividing tumor cells may also be
susceptible to Cpd21 activity if they share common pathways with MPNSTs that are
potential target(s) of Cpd21.

Recent advances in MPNST research have pointed to additional potential therapeutic targets
including the CXCR4 cytokine axis (7), the mTOR pathways (44), and the RAS/MEK/ERK
pathways (13, 47–50). In these studies, AMD3100 and rapamycin have been shown to
inhibit MPNSTs from the cis-Nf1+/−;p53+/− mouse model, and ERK inhibitors, such as
U0126, have been verified in a variety of human and mouse derived MPNSTs. Interestingly,
when such compounds were tested in conjunction with Cp21, we found no additive value.
Instead, blockade of the PI3K pathway did cooperate with Cpd21 action to inhibit tumor
growth. This intriguing result points to the potential plasticity of cancer cells and to the
complexity of tumor pathway interactions. For example, it may be that Cpd21 activity

somehow unveils a synthetic dependence on PI3Kinase signaling that is not present in the
absence of compound. Continued studies of Cpd21, its specific mode of action and the
mechanistic basis for its activity on MPNST cells but not on non-tumorigenic cells may shed
light on novel anticancer pathways.

Figure 3. Effect of Cpd21 on Cell Cycle Machinery
(A) Effect of Cpd21 on cell cycle distribution. sMPNST cells were treated with DMSO, D,
or Cpd21 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5 or 5 µM) for 24 h, pulsed with BrdU for 30 min, and analyzed by
flow cytometry. Percentage of cells in each phase is shown. (B, C, D) sMPNST cells were
treated with DMSO, D, or with Cpd21 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 µM) for 24 h and RNA
harvested for qRT-PCR for cyclins (B), cdks (C), or CDKIs (D). (E) Western blot for cyclin
D1 in sMPNST cells that were treated with DMSO, D, or Cpd21 (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 µM).
All values represent the mean±standard deviation. Student’s t-test used for significance
testing (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).

Figure 4. Cpd21 Induces Apoptosis in vitro
(A) Annexin V staining as detected by flow cytometry. sMPNST cells were treated with
DMSO, D, or Cpd21 (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 µM). sMPNST cells were treated with
staurosporine, St, as positive control. (B–F) Western blotting for caspase 3 cleavage in
sMPNST cells (B), PARP cleavage in sMPNST cells (C), caspase 3 cleavage in MPNSTs
from cis-Nf1+/−;p53+/− mice (D), caspase 3 cleavage in human MPNST cell line, S462 (E),
caspase 3 cleavage in Myc-SC (F), and caspase 3 cleavage in MEF cells (G). Each cell type
was treated with staurosporine, St, as a positive control. Total caspase 3 (T. Casp 3) and
cleaved caspase 3 (Cl. Casp 3) were assayed in each case. All values represent the mean
±standard deviation. Student’s t-test used for significance testing (*p<0.05, **p<0.01,
***p<0.001).

Figure 5. Effect of Cpd21 in vivo
(A and B) Cpd21 was incubated with murine, hepatic S9 fractions (A) or murine hepatocyte
(B) for indicated times. Amount of Cpd21 remaining was quantified by mass spectrometry.
(C) Cpd21 was injected at 20 mg/kg IP and quantified in plasma or tumor over time. PK
parameters were quantified using the noncompartmental analysis tool in WinNonlin
(Pharsight). (D) sMPNST-luc+ cells were injected subcutaneously in nude mice. Cpd21 (40
mg/kg) or vehicle was injected IP twice per day for 4 weeks. Mice were imaged every 7
days. Images shown are from week 4. (E) Quantification of tumor images in D by
normalizing total flux at week 4 with baseline flux (n=10 for vehicle, n=8 for Cpd21). (F)
BrdU staining of Cpd21- or vehicle-treated tumors (G) Quantification of F. (H)
