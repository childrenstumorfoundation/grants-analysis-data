There is emerging evidence for reduced muscle function in children with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). We have
examined three murine models featuring NF1 deﬁciency in muscle to study the effect on muscle function as well as
any underlying pathophysiology. The Nf11/ – mouse exhibited no differences in overall weight, lean tissue mass,
ﬁber size, muscle weakness as measured by grip strength or muscle atrophy-recovery with limb disuse, although
this model lacks many other characteristic features of the human disease. Next, muscle-speciﬁc knockout mice
2/2) were generated and they exhibited a failure to thrive leading to neonatal lethality. Intramyocellular
(Nf1muscle
lipid accumulations were observed by electron microscopy and Oil Red O staining. More mature muscle

2/2 mice. Western analyses showed increases in the expression
of oxidative metabolism enzymes in the Nf1Prx1
of fatty acid synthase and the hormone leptin, as well as decreased expression of a number of fatty acid transpor-
ters in this mouse line. These data support the hypothesis that NF1 is essential for normal muscle function and
survival and are the ﬁrst to suggest a direct link between NF1 and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is asso-
ciated with a range of features including superﬁcial and deep
neuroﬁbromas, developmental delay affecting both cognitive
and motor performance and musculoskeletal complications
(1). In recent years, the complexity of the musculoskeletal man-
ifestations has been elaborated on by a number of basic, transla-
tional and clinical studies (2). Whereas there has been
substantive progress in exploring the bony abnormalities, only
recently has muscle emerged as a tissue of interest in individuals
with NF1.

While scoliosis and congenital dysplasias (particularly tibial
dysplasia) have long been part of the standard diagnostic criteria

for NF1, individuals with this condition are also prone to low
bone mineral density (BMD) (3,4). While low BMD can correl-
ate with orthopedic complications such as scoliosis, population
studies have yet to demonstrate a signiﬁcant correlation with
fracture risk (5,6). These bony manifestations have now been
mechanistically linked to several underlying causes. Focal
bone defects such as congenital tibial dysplasia have been asso-
ciated with local double inactivation of NF1, and this may be the
basis for some cases of dystrophic scoliosis (7). In contrast, low
BMD is more likely to result from haploinsufﬁciency for NF1
leading to increased osteoclast activity (8). Many additional
bone dysplasias associated with NF1 (sphenoid wing dysplasia,
pectus excavatum, rib penciling) still have an unknown etiology,
but may result from deﬁciencies in developmental patterning.

In 1994, the NF1 gene product neuroﬁbromin was found to be
upregulated during myoblast differentiation, suggesting a poten-
tial role in muscle (9). Nevertheless, the deﬁcits in motor skills
and co-ordination associated with NF1 have been historically
attributed to central nervous system dysfunction (10). Lately,
however, a number of clinical reports have identiﬁed decreases
in muscle size (11,12), strength (13,14) and motor proﬁciency
(15), leading to renewed speculation regarding primary muscle
involvement. Muscle weakness could also contribute to systemic
osteopenia due to decreased loading, and load-carrying regions
of the skeleton are reported as the most affected (3,11). Still,
the interactions between muscle and bone, particularly as a
modifying factor for BMD and fracture risk, remain unclear.

Recent work with the Nf1Prx1

2/2 mouse (Prx1-cre driven Nf1
deletion in the limbs) has reinforced the importance of NF1 in
2/2 mice were
muscle development (12). In this study, Nf1Prx1
studied from the earliest stages of limb bud morphogenesis.
These mice display a congenital myopathy characterized by
reduced muscle ﬁbers, reduced muscle force and ﬁbrosis. Neuro-
ﬁbromin is a key negative regulator of Ras signaling, and can ac-
tivate a variety of downstream pathways including c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
2/2 mice showed increased
Muscle extracts from adult Nf1Prx1
MAPK signaling, but signaling intermediate cAMP was also
dysregulated. Both cAMP and mitochondrial enzyme dysfunc-
tion have also been reported in nf1-deﬁcient fruitﬂies (16). Inter-
estingly, in the ﬂy model, cAMP analogues were able to
ameliorate the nf1 phenotype.

While the Nf1Prx1

2/2 mouse demonstrates a critical role for
Nf1 in limb development, Prx1-cre expression affects all mesen-
chymal lineages of the developing limbs, including adipocytes
and vasculature endothelial cells (12). It also does not speciﬁcal-
ly address whether NF1 heterozygous mice manifest a muscle
phenotype. Consequently, we sought to examine muscle func-
tion in a range of different NF1 mouse models.

First, we investigated muscle structure and function in the het-
+/2 mouse; Nf12/2 knockout is embryonic lethal
erozygous Nf1
(17). Grip strength testing was performed and muscle tissue was
+/2 muscle to
examined by histology. Next, the capacity of Nf1
respond to stress was tested in a botox-induced disuse atrophy/

recovery model. To speciﬁcally examine the biological import-
ance of the Nf1 gene in muscle, we generated a muscle-speciﬁc
double knockout of NF1 using the MyoD-cre and Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox lines
2/2 line showed a severe muscle pheno-
(18,19). This Nf1MyoD
type resulting in neonatal lethality. Lastly, some of the histo-
2/2
logical and metabolic features revealed by the Nf1MyoD
neonates were examined in Nf1-null muscle tissue from
mature Nf1Prx1

2/2 mice.

mice was measured using a mouse grip strength meter. No differ-
ence was seen compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig. 1A).

No signiﬁcant difference was seen in body weight with Nf1
mice, as has been previously shown (P ¼ 0.16), thus speciﬁc

force was also unchanged. Examination of muscle ﬁber size
showed initially no difference, although ﬁber size is known to
vary by ﬁber type. Consequently, sections from the tibialis anter-
+/2 and WT mice were stained for ﬁber type. No sig-
ior of Nf1
niﬁcant differences in ﬁber size were observed (Fig. 1B).

To examine the response of Nf1
limb musculature was locally injected with Botox. Mice were
analyzed for gait and weight until they were ambulating normal-
ly. Botox treatment caused a decrease in ambulation that corre-
sponded with a decrease in body weight in both the WT and
+/2 mice (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). There was
Nf1
no signiﬁcant difference in the total body weight lost or the
time taken to regain this weight in either group. Functionally,
there was no difference in the time to restore normal gait.

tary Material, Fig. S2A) or muscle wet weight (Supplementary

Nf11/2 mice show greater acute cortical bone loss with
unloading

Prior analyses had shown no signiﬁcant difference in bone para-
+/2 and WT mice, although fracture repair
meters between Nf1
was delayed (20). To examine bone loss and recovery with
disuse, bone mineral content and bone volume (BV) were ana-
lyzed by X-ray, DXA and microCT.

Analysis of the tibia by microCT showed rapid bone loss fol-
+/2 mice exhibited a
lowing botox treatment in all mice. The Nf1
more rapid loss of cortical bone with unloading (Fig. 3). Loss of
trabecular bone and the ability to recover both cortical and tra-
becular bone at 12 weeks after the resumption of load were stat-
istically no different between Nf1

+/2 and WT mice.

Muscle-speciﬁc KO of Nf1 causes decreased body
weight and neonatal lethality

To explore the functional role of neuroﬁbromin in muscle tissue,
we generated a muscle-speciﬁc Nf1 knockout mouse driven by
MyoD-cre. Nf1 gene recombination has been previously
reported in muscle isolated from this line (21). Conditional
knockout mice were analyzed at days 2, 4 and 6, and weighed sig-
niﬁcantly less than control litter mates (Fig. 4). While smaller,
the mutant mice did not show shortened or bowed long bones
2/2 pups
or impaired mobility. Autopsy of dead Nf1muscle
showed the presence of milk in their stomachs, evident of
some capacity for suckling. No organ failure was apparent in
the post-mortem. The primary cause of death was attributed to
maternal infanticide, likely due to their inability to thrive com-
pared with littermates.

+/2 mice. Following Botox-induced limb disuse, WT and Nf1

underwent weekly DEXA analysis to quantify lean tissue mass. In WT and
+/2 mouse strains, Botox lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in lean tissue mass

ence in loss or recover of lean tissue mass in Nf1
mice with Botox treatment (P . 0.05).

Ultrastructural analysis of Nf1 knockout muscle tissue

Ultrathin sections of muscle were analyzed from Nf1muscle
mice and littermate controls by transmission electron micros-
copy (EM). While it was hypothesized that force generation
may be compromised due to deﬁciencies in cytoarchitecture,

determine any initial changes in muscle histology. No signiﬁcant
difference was seen in muscle ﬁber size at this time point (P.

seen by Gomori Trichrome staining, which is used to detect mito-
chondrial myopathy (Fig. 6A –D). Based on the lipid noted by
EM, an Oil Red O stain was performed and this revealed

marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the Nf1muscle
mouse muscle (Fig. 6E–H, Supplementary Material, Fig. S3).
These droplets varied considerably in size but were discrete dro-

2/2 mice. This latter strain has the Nf1 gene knocked
from Nf1Prx1
out in the entire limb, including the myoﬁbers, adipocytes and vas-
cular cells, yet the mice survive as previously reported (12).
Muscle tissue was dissected from the hind limbs of 2 months
2/2 mice. Mitochondrial enzymes SDH, citrate synthase
Nf1Prx1
(CS), b-hydroxyacyldehydrogenase (BHAD) and medium-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) were tested and compared
with WT littermate controls. No differences were seen in the
2/2 samples, but there were 2-fold increases in SDH,
Nf1muscle
2/2 samples relative
BHAD and MCAD activity for the Nf1Prx1
to littermate controls (P , 0.05) (Fig. 7).

Further analysis of the Nf1Prx1

2/2 mice showed considerable
increases in triglyceride content of almost 10-fold (Fig. 8A).
This was consistent with observation of increased intramyocel-
2/2 line. Muscle
lular fat deposits in the neonatal Nf1muscle
2/2 mice and littermate
extracts from the quadriceps of Nf1Prx1
controls were analyzed by western panels (Fig. 8B). No differ-
ences were seen in the expression of OXPHOS complexes,
PPARg1,2 or UCP3. Notably, however, signiﬁcant increases
were seen in the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and
leptin. We also observed decreased levels of fatty acid transport
proteins carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, CD36 and FATP4.

DISCUSSION

NF1 belongs to the RASopathy class of diseases, and the NF1
gene product is a negative regulator of Ras GTPase activity.
The RASopathies are a family of diseases that include Noonan

syndrome, Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syn-
drome. Since initiating our study in multiple mouse lines, the
paradigm of NF1 muscle has advanced to suggest that bone
and muscle involvement could be a feature of all RASopathies
(22,23). To further study this concept, Stevenson and coworkers
undertook studies of muscle function in jumping and grip
strength tests (24,25). Their 2011 study used force plate and
hand-held dynamometer testing to show that hip extension
strength was decreased in NF1 patients. Nevertheless, overall
jumping and hopping force production was not signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent, potentially reﬂecting compensation by other muscles
groups and/or insufﬁcient statistical power. A subsequent
study in 2012 measured grip strength in a range of RASopathies
and found peripheral muscle weakness in all patient cohorts, in-
cluding NF1 (22).

+/2 and Nf1muscle

In this study, we have gone on to examine the effects of NF1
deﬁciency on muscle in a number of different genetically modi-
2/2 mouse
ﬁed mouse models. Previous work with the Nf1Prx1
that lacks Nf1 in the limb mesenchyme revealed that this can
lead to muscle weakness and a dystrophy-like phenotype (12).
Additional fat has also been observed in this line (26).
However, this is the ﬁrst study to also examine muscle in the
2/2 mouse lines, which show less and
Nf1
more severe phenotypes, respectively.
+/2 mouse model was generated in 1994 and has been
extensively explored as a model of human disease (17). In some
instances, this line adequately reﬂects the clinical features of
NF1, such as showing impaired fracture healing that parallels
orthopedic NF1 patients (20). In this study, we also show that
+/2 mice lose cortical bone more rapidly after Botox-

2/2 mice showed sig-

2/2 neonatal muscle for any genotype or enzyme. In contrast, mature NF1-null muscle from Nf1Prx1

+/2 line dem-
recovery is normal. This is consistent with the Nf1
onstrating a mild bone phenotype, although heterozygous mice
fail to recapitulate many of the disease features of NF1, such
as the systemic issues with bone density and bone metabolism
(4,5,11). Consequentially, numerous murine models featuring
double inactivation of Nf1 have been established in order to
phenocopy human manifestations not speciﬁcally associated
with NF1 double inactivation, including systemic osteopenia
(27).

In this study, we found no detectable muscle phenotype in the
+/2 mice, based on histology and grip strength. While there
Nf1
was a trend towards a larger ﬁber area in 2B and 2X ﬁbers, this did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance. In contrast, clinical studies
have shown individuals with NF1 present with a mean decrease
of at least 50% in raw handgrip strength (24). Fiber size and ﬁber
type proportions have not been reported in individuals with NF1.
In addition, immobilization-induced muscle/lean tissue loss
+/2 mice versus controls, even
was not different in the Nf1
though cortical bone loss was greater. Together, these data
+/2 strain represents a poor system for mod-
suggest that the Nf1
eling weakness or muscle dysfunction reported in individuals
with NF1.

Subsequently, we analyzed two additional models where Nf1
was double-inactivated either in cells of the muscle lineage using
2/2), or in the mesenchyme of
a MyoD-cre transgene (Nf1muscle
2/2
the developing limb using a Prx1-cre transgene (Nf1Prx1
+/2 mice, signiﬁcant phenotypic
mouse) (18,28). Unlike the Nf1
effects were seen in the tissue-speciﬁc knockouts, indicating im-
portant development functions for Nf1 in mouse muscle. This has
2/2 strain with a focus on
previously been reported in the Nf1Prx1
the early embryonic speciﬁcation and patterning of muscle, and
this report demonstrated increases in MAPK signaling (12). In

this study, we have identiﬁed a novel mechanism that suggests
a regulatory role for Nf1 in mitochondrial function in mamma-
lian muscle.

Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of a pre-
viously unrecognized mitochondrial deregulation component of
NF1 pathogenesis. First, Nf1 has been implicated in the regula-
tion of mitochondrial function in the Drosophila model (16).
In this model, it has been shown that loss of nf1 causes decreased
ATP synthesis and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) pro-
duction, yielding shorter life span of the fruit ﬂy. Conversely, nf1
overexpression increased complex I activity and decreased ROS,
2/2 mouse,
but CS activity remained unchanged. In the Nf1Prx1
we noted an increase in SDH activity consistent with increased
mitochondrial function, but CS activity was unchanged. While
the same pathways were affected as in the ﬂy models, the direc-
tion of change was inverted (loss of Nf1 increased rather than
decreased mitochondrial activity). This difference may be attrib-
uted to differences between the species, and in muscle it has been
previously reported that there is increased cAMP activation in
2/2 mouse (12), whereas the ﬂy model showed
the Nf1Prx1
decreased cAMP (16).

Furthermore, in Drosophila, the effects of nf1 on mitochon-
drial function were found to be independent of Ras signaling
(16). However, this may not be true for mammalian cells
where Ras may have a more profound inﬂuence on mitochon-
drial respiration. Other RASopathies can affect cellular metabol-
ism, for example in vitro expression of a mutant D61G SHP2
(which results in Noonan syndrome) decreased ATP levels and
mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS (29).
Clinically, mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in
a range of RASopathies (30,31). Intriguingly, in mouse ﬁbro-
blasts expressing activated V12 H-Ras, a transient increase

Notably, in neonatal muscle from the Nf1muscle

2/2 line, no
signiﬁcant changes were seen in oxidative enzyme activity;
however, the noted increase in intramyocellular lipid indicated
fundamental changes in fat metabolism. Overall, the increases
2/2
in SDH, BHAD and MCAD activity seen in the Nf1Prx1
2/2 are likely attributable to the differ-
strain but not the Nf1muscle
ences in mouse ages used and relative maturity of the tissues.
However, the presence of increased metabolic activity in non-
2/2 strain cannot be completely

discounted and increased adipocytes have been reported in this
line (26).

Further experiments will need to be undertaken to address key
mechanistic and translational questions still remaining. While
conditions affecting mitochondrial lipid oxidation (including
deﬁciencies
in the acyl CoA dehydrogenase family of
enzymes) can lead to lipid accumulations (33), this is normally
associated with impaired enzyme function, rather than increased
2/2 mice. Interestingly, the
activity as was noted in the Nf1Prx1
2/2 muscle showed lipid accumulation without mito-
Nf1muscle
chondrial enzyme dysfunction, potentially suggesting that the
latter may develop with time as a consequence of increased
lipid being present. Also consistent with this model, increases
were detected in FAS, as an enzyme involved with regulating
lipid biosynthesis, and leptin, a circulating hormone involved
with regulating appetite and metabolism. Intriguingly, regula-
tory feedback may exist between neuroﬁbromin and cellular
lipid metabolism; NF1 protein stability is regulated by the
ETEA/Ubxd8 ubiquitase 1, which itself is a cellular sensor of
the unsaturated fatty acids (34). In addition, the observed
decreases in fatty acid transport proteins could impair fat traf-
ﬁcking and contribute to the accumulation of intramyocellular
lipids. Finally, robust experimental evidence will need to
conﬁrm whether the metabolic alterations reported in these
mouse models are present in human NF1 muscle.

In conclusion, data from these mouse models support the
concept that hypotonia, decreased strength and motor function
in individuals with NF1 may result from abnormal Ras or
cAMP signaling in the muscle, rather than being attributable
+/2
purely to central nervous system dysfunction. The Nf1
model has previously been shown to not reproduce many of
the clinical features of NF1 and we show that it does not replicate
the muscle phenotype seen in humans. This may imply that
human muscle is more dependent on Ras regulation than
2/2
mouse muscle. Nevertheless, the Nf1muscle
strains show signiﬁcant muscle involvement and NF1 appears
to be an important regulator of muscle metabolism.

Thus, the molecular regulation of mitochondrial metabolism
in Nf1-deﬁcient muscle is likely to be complex and involve
crosstalk between multiple pathways.

Grip strength test

A grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments) was used to test
mouse forearm grip strength as recorded in Newtons (N). Mice
were held by the base of the tail and allowed to grip the
trapeze with their front paws and then pulled with their body par-
allel to the ﬂoor. Each mouse was trialed 10 times with the
highest and lowest readings excluded; the remaining readings
were averaged. A single experienced tester was used blinded
to genotype.

Botox induced unloading

Botox injection has previously been used to injure muscle and
cause unloading of the bone (36). Following this principle,
+/2 mice, 48 total, aged 8 weeks were treated with
WT and Nf1
Botox (1 mg) via four intramuscular injections to induce unload-
ing of the right hind limb. Mice were analyzed by video analysis
of gait until gait was considered normal, and weighed and
X-rayed weekly. Weekly DEXA scans (dual X-ray absorpti-
ometry) were also performed using a Lunar PIXImus DEXA
Scanner (GE Lunar PIXImus). Time points were at 1, 2, 3 and
12 weeks. Endpoint analysis included microCT of the Botox
and contra-lateral limb using a Skyscan 1174 scanner (Skyscan
Corp) and isolated muscle weight measurements.

Electron microscopy

tions were rinsed in 60% isopropanol before staining with Oil
Red O stain solution. Stain solution is prepared from a stock so-
lution (0.5 g Oil Red O in 100 ml isopropanol) dissolved 3:2 in
dH2O. Slides were incubated for 15 min in stain solution,
before rinsing with 60% isopropanol. Slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin and rinsed in water before mounting in
aqueous media. Quantiﬁcation was performed using BioQuant
Analysis System to select red oil droplets within the section
(Nashville, TN, USA).

Fiber size measurements were performed on transverse 8 mm
sections from the tibialis anterior. Sections were stained by
immunohistochemistry for ﬁber type using antibodies against
myosin isoforms, and membrane was staining was performed
using an anti-dystrophin antibody. Fiber size measurements
were performed with users blinded to genotype. Cross-sectional
ﬁber diameter was deﬁned as the length of the longest chord per-
pendicular to the longest distance that stretches through the
center of the ﬁber. Fiber diameters were measured using cali-
brated Image-Pro Plus 2.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, MD, USA). Methods for immunostaining and quantita-
tion were performed as previously published with no modiﬁca-
tions to the protocol (37).

1.3.5.1) were determined by spectrophotometry in muscle
homogenates using methods described previously (38). Assays
were performed at 308C in duplicate and values were averaged.
Activities were corrected for total protein content as measured
using the BioRad Protein Assay (500-0006), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, for BSA standards and extracts in
duplicate. The mg protein in each extract was used to convert
the activities of each enzyme (mU) to speciﬁc activities (mU/

Histological staining

Hind limb muscles were collected immediately after cull
covered in cryo-preservation medium (Tissue-Tek) and frozen
in partly thawed isopentane pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen. Cryo-
sected muscle underwent trichrome stain to determine abnor-
malities in connective tissue or large protein accumulations.
Sections were incubated in Harris Haematoxylin pH 2.3 for
5 min. Slides were then rinsed ﬁve times in distilled water and
incubated in trichrome solution for 60 min [0.6% chromotype

Statistical analyses

Cell culture assays were conducted in triplicate at least. Values
are presented as mean + standard error (SE), and statistical com-
parisons were made using parametric two-tailed Student’s
t-tests. P-values of P , 0.05 were considered statistically sig-
niﬁcant.

For mouse studies, it was unclear whether data ﬁt a normal
distribution so more stringent non-parametric statistical tests
were performed. Data were tested by Mann – Whitney U
(two-independent groups) or a Kruskal – Wallis test (K inde-
pendent groups) using SPSS Legacy Non-Parametric testing
software (SBSS Statistics v19). Again, P values of P , 0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Error bars represent
the standard error of the mean.
