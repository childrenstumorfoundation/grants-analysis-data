Abstract

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a serious unmet medical need. Despite high remission rates with
chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients.
Activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML.
Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML.
Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options
to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG
925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG
925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without signiﬁcant body weight loss. The antitumor
activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic
markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3
mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a
cyclin D–dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to
external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4–RB pathway in cancer development has been well
established. CDK4-speciﬁc inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which
combines inhibition of two kinases essential for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may
improve and prolong clinical responses. Mol Cancer Ther; 13(4); 880–9. Ó2014 AACR.

Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a signif-
icant unmet medical need. It is a hematologic malig-
nancy characterized by uncontrolled proliferation
of the hematopoietic progenitor cells of myeloid line-
age. The current standard of care is chemotherapy
with and without allogeneic stem cell transplanta-
tion. Induction chemotherapy is successful in 65% of
all patients with AML. Using chemotherapy as consol-
idation, up to 50% of patients that receive consolidation
go into long-term remission. The actual chance of
long-term remission depends on speciﬁc prognostic
factors as age, chromosomal aberrations, and molecular
changes. The relative 5-year survival rate is 24% in
patients diagnosed with AML (1). More efﬁcacious and

safer therapeutics are being developed and tested in
clinical trials.

FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) is a well-recognized
drug target for treating AML. Activating mutations in
FLT3 are found in approximately 30% of patients with
AML (2–4). The majority of the activating mutations are
internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane
region. Numerous FLT3 inhibitors have entered clinical
studies and shown initial clinical responses. However, the
responses are transient and resistance develops rapidly
(5, 6). The major resistance mechanism seems to be acqui-
sition of secondary mutations in FLT3, which interfere
with the ability of small-molecule inhibitors to bind to
FLT3 (4, 5). One strategy to overcome resistance to FLT3
inhibitors in the clinic is to combine them with chemo-
therapy despite the recognition that chemotherapy is
poorly tolerated (6, 7).

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6) are
two functionally indistinguishable cyclin D–dependent
kinases. As a key downstream effector of growth factor
activation, CDK4 promotes G1–S transition of the cell cycle
by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB),
a tumor-suppressor protein. A large body of evidence
supports important involvement of the p16INK4a-CDK4–
RB axis in cancer development (8–12). RB negatively
regulates the cell cycle at G1 by sequestering E2F proteins

that are required for initiation of S phase. p16INK4a is a
member of the INK4 family of CDK4 cellular inhibitors
(10–13) and a tumor suppressor. The genes for RB and
p16INK4a are frequently deleted or silenced in various
types of cancer. Although mutations in RB and p16INK4a
are rare in patients with AML, p15INK4b, another member
of the INK4 family, has been reported to be downregu-
lated in up to 60% of patients with AML (14, 15), indi-
cating an important role of CDK4 in AML. Recently, a
selective CDK4 inhibitor PD 0332991 has entered clinical
trials and showed promising anticancer efﬁcacy in
patients with advanced breast cancer (16, 17). Anticancer
activity of PD 0332991 has also been reported in clinical
and preclinical studies of other cancer types, including
AML (18–21). Here, we report the preclinical evaluation
of a FLT3/CDK4 dual kinase inhibitor AMG 925. We
believe that combined inhibition of two essential kinases
by AMG 925 has potential to reduce development of drug
resistance in patients with AML.

dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl)-2-oxoethanol) was
synthesized at Amgen. PD 0332991 and sorafenib were
purchased from AdooQ BioScience.

Cell lines

MOLM13 and Mv4-11 were obtained from the DSMZ
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures.
MOLM13-Luc cells were constructed by transduction of
MOLM13 cells with the pLV218G luciferin/lentivector,
which expresses luciferase under the murine EF1a pro-
moter. Sorafenib-resistant MOLM13 (MOLM13sr) and
Mv4-11 (Mv4-11sr) were isolated by passaging the cells
in growth medium containing increasing concentrations
of sorafenib (1–1,000 nmol/L). RNA was isolated from
independent clones and sequenced to identify FLT3
kinase domain mutations, D835Y in MOLM13sr and
D835V in Mv4-11. The other cell lines used in this study
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
Growth conditions recommended by the providers were
followed. All of the cell lines were authenticated by short
tandem repeat DNA proﬁling; MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-
436, and MDA-MB-468 were by Genetica DNA Labora-
tories; and the rest by DDC Medical.

Kinases

CDK4/cyclin D1, CDK6/cyclin D1, CDK1/Cyclin B,
and CDK2/Cyclin A were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. For the kinase assays, RB fragment (amino
acids 773–928) and histone H1 (Millipore) were used as
substrate for CDK4/6 and CDK1/2, respectively. [r-33P]-
ATP was from PerkinElmer. The assays were performed
in 96-well ﬁlter plates (MSDVN6B50; Millipore) with a
ﬁnal volume of 100 mL, containing 1 mg RB, 25 ng CDK4/

cyclin D1, 25 mmol/L ATP, 1 mCi [r-33P]-ATP, and the test
compound in kinase reaction buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-
HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L b-glyceropho-
sphate, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1% bovine
serum albumin). The reaction mixes were incubated at
room temperature for 1 hour and terminated with 20%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Wells were washed with 10%
TCA, let dry, and processed for scintillation counting with
TopCount (PerkinElmer). FLT3 kinase assay was per-
formed using a time-resolved ﬂuorescence resonance
energy transfer assay. The FLT3 enzyme (glutathione S-
transferase–fused human FLT3 cytoplasmic domain, ami-
no acids 564–993) was from Carna Biosciences. An
ULight-labeled synthetic peptide (ULight-JAK1; Perki-
nElmer) derived from human Janus kinase 1 (amino acids
1015–1027) was used as the phosphoacceptor substrate.
The FLT3 kinase reaction was conducted in a 384-well
white OptiPlate (PerkinElmer) in a total volume of 20 mL.
The reaction mixture contained 50 nmol/L ULight-JAK1,
116 mmol/L ATP (equal to Km), 0.5 nmol/L FLT3, and
serially diluted test compounds in a reaction buffer of 50
mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, and 0.005% Tween 20. The reac-
tion was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at room temper-
ature and stopped by adding 20 mL of 20 mmol/L EDTA
and 4 nmol/L LANCE Eu-W1024 anti-phosphotyrosine
antibody in LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer). The
plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours
after addition of detection reagents and were then read on
an Envision multimode reader (PerkinElmer). Fluores-
cence signals were measured at 615 nm (8.5-nm band-
width) and 665 nm (7.5-nm bandwidth) with a 60-ms delay
after excitation at 320 nm (75-nm bandwidth). The signal
ratio at 665/615 nm was used in all data analyses.

Cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle

Cell growth was measured by a DNA synthesis assay.
Cells were seeded in a 96-well Cytostar T plate (GE
Healthcare Biosciences) at a density of 5  103 cells/well
in a total volume of 160 mL. Test compounds were serially
diluted into the plate (20 mL/well) and 20 mL/0.1 mCi of
[14C]-Thymidine (GE Healthcare Biosciences) added to
each well. Isotope incorporation was determined using
a b plate counter (Wallac) after further 72-hour incuba-
tion. Apoptosis was assayed by using the Vybrant
Apoptosis Assay Kit#9 (Invitrogen; Cat# V35113) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, cells were
seeded into a 6-well plate at 5  105 cells per well and
treated with compounds for 24 hours. The cells were
then stained with reagents provided in the kit and
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The Sytox Green ﬂuores-
cence versus allophycocyanin ﬂuorescence dot plot
shows resolution of live, apoptotic, and dead cells,
which were quantiﬁed using the Flowjo software. The
cell-cycle analysis was done by treating the cells with
AMG 925 for 24 hours followed by using the CycleTest
Kit (BD Biosciences) following manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Ten thousand events were acquired and the

WB with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Millipore; Cat#
05-1050) for P-FLT3 or an anti-FLT3 antibody (R&D Sys-
tems; Cat# BAF812) for total FLT3 (T-FLT3). Protein bands
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences; Cat# RPN2106) and
analyzed with the ImageJ software (NIH). Meso Scale
Discovery (MSD) assays were used to determine cellular
levels of phospho-STAT5 (P-STAT5) and phospho-RB
(P-RB). A total of 1  104 cells/well in 96-well plates were
incubated with dilutions of compounds. Cell lysates were
harvested 1 or 24 hours after addition of compounds for
determination of P-STAT5 and P-RB, respectively, using
kits from Meso Scale Discovery (Cat# K150IGD-1 for
P-STAT5 and Cat# K150ITD-1 for P-RB).

To determine P-STAT5 or P-RB in xenograft tumor
samples, tumors were allowed to grow to 200 to 250
mm3 before administration of AMG 925 via oral gavages.
The tumor samples were dissected and snap frozen at
different time points after dosing, and the lysates pre-
pared and assayed for levels of P-STAT5 and P-RB
similarly as for cultured cells.

MOLM13 xenograft tumor model

CrTac:NCR-Foxn1nu

(NCR) nude mice were treated with
an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mL of anti-asialo
GM (WAKO Chemicals) antibody to abolish natural killer
activity and allow for enhanced growth of subsequently
inoculated tumor cells. The following day, 7.5 million
MOLM13 tumor cells in PBS were formulated as a 1:1
mixture with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into
the subcutaneous space on the right ﬂank of the mice.
Tumors were measured with PRO-MAX electronic digital
caliper (Japan Micrometer Mfg. Co. LTD) and the mice
were weighed every other day before each tumor measure-
ment. Tumor volumes were calculated as follows: tumor
volume (mm3) ¼ [(W2  L)/2] in which width (W) is de-
ﬁned as the smaller of the two measurements and length
(L) is deﬁned as the larger of the two measurements.

MOLM13-Luc systemic tumor model
MOLM13-Luc cells stably expressing luciferase were
injected intravenously (i.v.) into NOD/SCID IL-2Rg / 
(NSG) mice. After 6 days, mice were injected with an i.p.
injection of D-luciferin, tissues removed, and imaged
using an IVIS imager. MOLM13-Luc cells localized to the
spleen and the bone marrow of the sternum and hind

limbs. At 13 days after injection, tumor cells were more
widespread to the peripheral blood, spleen, lung, ovaries,
and calvaria. For efﬁcacy evaluation of AMG 925, 5  104
MOLM13-Luc cells in PBS were inoculated via i.v. injection
in tail vein. The cells were allowed to grow for 6 days and
randomized for treatment using imaging with a Xenogen
IVIS 200 imager (PerkinElmer). Before imaging, mice
were given an i.p. injection of 150 mg/kg Fireﬂy D-lucif-
erin (Caliper Life Sciences) and dorsal and ventral images
were captured. Tumor burden was quantiﬁed using
Living Image 2.5 software for regions of interest (ROI):
total body (dorsal and ventral). Mice (n ¼ 60) were sorted
from low to high by drawing ROIs over the dorsal and
ventral images and taking the sum of these images (whole-
body bioluminescence imaging). The bottom 5 and top
5 animals in the sort were excluded from the study. The
remaining mice were randomly assigned to therapeutic
groups to achieve ﬁve groups of (n ¼ 10) with equivalent
whole-body tumor burden. Treatments were initiated on
day 7 and continued for 10 consecutive days. Twice daily
doses were administered 6 hours apart. After completion
of the treatments, mice were monitored for either devel-
opment of hind limb paralysis (HLP) that resulted from
disease progression and >20% body weight loss. Mice
were humanely sacriﬁced using CO2 asphyxiation and
cervical dislocation in accordance with Amgen Institution-
al Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) criteria.

Colo205 xenograft tumor model

2  106 cells were innoculated on the ﬂank of NCR nude
mice and allowed to grow for 13 days. Mice were then
dosed twice a day by oral administration 6 hours apart
with 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg/kg of AMG 925 formulated
in 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/1% Tween 80 for
10 consecutive days.

Pharmacokinetics and plasma concentration

Animals were orally dosed with AMG 925 and plasma
samples were collected at time points after dosing. Con-
centrations of AMG 925 in the plasma were determined
with a multiple reaction monitoring method on a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with high-pres-
sure liquid chromatography system. Unbound AMG 925
concentrations were calculated based on protein binding
of the compound.

Immunohistochemistry

Femur samples from 3 mice in each of the treatment
groups were taken at 2 and 18 hours after the last dose and
processed for cutting sections for immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining. Sections were deparafﬁnized and then
heated in DIVA Decloaker solution for P-RB (Biocare) or
BORG Decloaker for P-STAT5 (Biocare) for 1 hour for
antigen retrieval. Remaining IHC steps were performed
at room temperature in a DAKO Autostainer. Sections
were incubated for 10 minutes with Peroxidazed 1 (Bio-
care) to block endogenous peroxidase, followed by incu-
bation for 10 minutes with Background Sniper for P-RB

P-STAT5 to reduce nonspeciﬁc background. Sections were
then incubated for 1 hour with FITC-P-RB at 0.375 mg/mL
or P-STAT5 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) at
3.26 mg/mL, and incubated for 30 minutes with rabbit
anti-FITC immunoglobulin G 1:200 (Invitrogen) for FITC-
P-RB. Sections were incubated for 30 minutes with Envi-
sionþ HRP (horseradish peroxidase) anti-rabbit polymer
(DAKO), followed by DABþ (DAKO) for 5 minutes. Sec-
tions were counterstained with hematoxylin (DAKO) for
approximately 1 minute. Ten 40 ﬁelds (720  720 pixels)
of MOLM13-Luc tumor cells were then counted for the
presence of positive staining nuclei. A nucleus was con-
sidered positive if it had uniform staining of at least "1þ"
intensity. Average fraction positive P-STAT5 and P-RB
were then calculated for each ﬁeld and treatment group
medians and signiﬁcance were generated by GraphPad
calculator with an unpaired t test and two-tailed P values.

Statistical analysis and IC50 determination
Tumor volumes are expressed as means  SE and
plotted as a function of time. Statistical signiﬁcance of
observed differences between growth curves was evalu-
ated by repeated measures analysis of covariance of the
log transformed tumor volume data with Dunnett-adjust-
ed multiple comparisons. The analysis was done using
SAS proc mixed with model effects of baseline log tumor
volume, day, treatment, and day-by-treatment interac-
tion; a repeated statement in which day was a repeated
value, animal the subject, and a Toeplitz covariance struc-
ture; and an lsmeans statement to do a Dunnett analysis
comparing the control group with the other treatment
groups. All statistical calculations were made through the
use of JMP software v7.0 interfaced with SAS v9.1 (SAS
Institute, Inc.). For the Kaplan–Meier analysis in the sys-
temic AML mouse model, the statistical analysis was
performed using the log-rank test using JMP software
v7.0 interfaced with SAS v9.1 (SAS Institute,
Inc.).
A difference between groups was deemed signiﬁcant if
P < 0.05. IC50 values of AMG 925 in in vitro assays were
determined by nonlinear regression curve ﬁtting using
GraphPad Prism v5.01 (GraphPad).

Results
AMG 925 is a potent, selective, and orally available
FLT3/CDK4 dual inhibitor

AMG 925 was discovered by high throughput screen-
ing and lead optimization. In vitro activities of AMG 925
are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. AMG 925 potently
inhibited FLT3, CDK4, and CDK6 in kinase assays with
IC50 in single-digit nanomolar range. The selectivity of
AMG 925 for CDK4 and FLT3 against CDK1, in which
inhibition is highly cytotoxic, was >500-fold. A fair overall
kinase selectivity of AMG 925 was as determined by
KinomScan against a panel of 442 various kinases (Sup-
plementary Table S1). Cellular selectivity (on-target
vs. off-target activity) of AMG 925 was about 50-fold
as evaluated by comparison of its growth-inhibiting

(FLT3-ITD; IC50
925 inhibited growth of MOLM13 and Mv4-11 cells
through FLT3, P-FLT3 and P-STAT5, direct substrates of
FLT3-ITD (22), were measured as speciﬁc pharmacody-
namic markers. In addition, apoptosis, a phenotype char-
acteristic of inhibition of FLT3 in sensitive AML cells, was
examined. As shown in Table 1, AMG 925 potently inhib-
ited P-STAT5 in AML cell lines MOLM13 (FLT3-ITD) and
Mv4-11 (FLT3-ITD) with IC50 values comparable with
those for kinase and growth inhibition. In Fig. 1B, AMG
925 induced apoptosis in MOLM13 in a dose-dependent
manner, but not in the FLT3-independent U937, indicat-
ing a speciﬁc inhibition of FLT3 in MOLM13. Further-
more, the apoptosis correlated with inhibition of P-FLT3
and P-STAT5 in treated cells. Similar effects by AMG 925
were observed in Mv4-11 cells (data not shown). To
demonstrate inhibition of CDK4 by AMG 925 in cells,
cell-cycle analysis was carried. As shown in Fig. 1C, AMG

925 induced G1 arrest in RB

Colo205. In contrast, AMG 925 did not cause G1 arrest
in RB
MDA-MB-468, which is consistent with the
growth inhibition potency of AMG 925 in these cell lines
(Table 1).

Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that AMG 925
was orally available with a half-life appropriate for
twice daily dosing in preclinical animals (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1).

AMG 925 inhibits signaling of FLT3-ITD/D835
mutants

Two sorafenib-resistant AML cell lines MOLM13sr and
Mv4-11sr were isolated as described in Materials and
Methods. The parental cells MOLM13 and Mv4-11
acquired FLT3-D835Y and Mv4-11sr FLT3-D835V, respec-
tively, during isolation for resistance to sorafenib. We
found that AMG 925 inhibited growth of both sorafe-

nib-resistant AML cell lines with potency comparable
with those of the parental cell lines MOLM13 and Mv4-
11 (Table 1). Growth inhibition of MOLM13sr and
Mv4-11sr by AMG 925 is believed to be primarily through
FLT3, which is supported by potent
inhibition of
P-STAT5 by AMG 925 in the cells (Table 1). This is also
supported by dose-dependent induction of apoptosis
by AMG 925 in the MOLM13sr cells, which was correlat-
ed with inhibition of P-FLT3 and P-STAT5 (Fig. 1B).
Sorafenib, however, caused only background level of
apoptosis and was much less potent
in inhibiting
P-FLT3 or P-STAT5 than AMG 925. Similar effects were
observed in Mv4-11sr (our unpublished observations).

mg/kg AMG 925. Tumors were then harvested 3, 9, 12,
and 24 hours after the ﬁrst dose, and analyzed for levels of
P-STAT5 and P-RB. Maximum inhibition of P-STAT5 and
P-RB was achieved at 6 and 12 hours respectively at the
37.5 mg/kg dose of AMG 925 (Fig. 2A, top and bottom).
Interestingly, a rebound of P-STAT5 at 24 hours was
observed, possibly as a result of compensational feedback.
The pharmacodynamic responses of P-STAT5 and P-RB
inhibition correlated with plasma concentrations of AMG
925 (Fig. 2A, top and bottom).

To determine antitumor efﬁcacy of AMG 925, tumor-
bearing mice were orally dosed twice daily with AMG
925. Dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth was
observed with the maximum inhibition after treatment
with 37.5 mg/kg AMG 925 (tumor growth inhibition, TGI
¼ 96%; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B, top). Taken together with the
pharmacodynamic data, this suggests that maximal efﬁ-
cacy in this model was achieved with greater than 80%
inhibition of P-STAT5 and greater than 90%inhibition of
P-RB for at least 12 hours. No differences in body weight
were observed (Fig. 2B, bottom). An ED50 of 9.2 mg/kg

(95% conﬁdence interval, CI, 5.8–14.4) was calculated
using individual tumor volumes on day 15.

AMG 925 inhibits growth of systemic MOLM13-Luc
xenograft tumors

To more closely mimic human AML, a MOLM13 sys-
temic tumor model was developed (see Materials and
Methods). Mice injected with MOLM13-Luc cells were
dosed with AMG 925 twice daily for 10 consecutive days.
AMG 925 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activ-
ity with calculated TGI of 99.7%, 97%, and 71% for the 37.5,
25, and 12.5 mg/kg dose groups, respectively (Fig. 3A).
An ED50 of 11 mg/kg (95% CI, 9.7–12.3) was calculated,
which was consistent with the ED50 determined in
the MOLM13 subcutaneous tumor model. Figure 3B
represents images taken at the end of the dosing period
showing that tumor cells in mice (colored) were greatly
reduced compared with vehicle control. No effects on
body weight were observed during the dosing period.
Time to moribund sacriﬁce was also measured for the
systemic MOLM13-Luc tumor model. After completion of

Figure 3. Activity of AMG 925 in systemic MOLM13-Luc xenograft tumor model. A, NSG mice engrafted with MOLM13-Luc tumors were treated with 12.5, 25,
or 37.5 mg/kg (mpk) AMG 925. Tumor burden was determined by quantiﬁcation of total body bioluminescence. Mice were injected with 150 mpk
Fireﬂy D-luciferin before imaging. Using unpaired t test and two-tailed P values to determine signiﬁcance, all AMG 925 treatment groups were
shown to be signiﬁcant as compared with vehicle group. All comparisons with vehicle have a P < 0.001. B, bioluminescence images of mice at the end

signs of HLP, or lost 20% of starting body weight were euthanized and plotted. D, femurs of mice treated similarly as in A were harvested at 8 or 24 hours
after the initial dose administration and processed for IHC staining for P-STAT5 or P-RB and positive nuclei counted (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for
quantitative data).

the 10-day dosing period, mice were monitored for signs
of morbidity and sacriﬁced according to IACUC guid-
ance. The mean time to moribund sacriﬁce was 21, 24, and
26 days for the 12.5, 25, and 37.5 mg/kg doses, respective-
ly, compared with 17.4 days for the vehicle-treated mice
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3C). After cessation of AMG 925 treatment,
all mice eventually succumbed to disease progression.
The terminal symptoms of mice in all treatment groups
were similar to those in the vehicle group. MOLM13-Luc
cells were detectably further spread from the initial major
sites of spleen and the bone marrow of sternum and hind
limbs to the peripheral blood, lung, ovaries, and calvaria
(Fig. 3B). HLP, which apparently resulted from severe
inﬁltration of the AML cells in the bone of hind limbs,
was closely observed as the beginning of terminal stage
of the disease. As soon as the mice showed HLP and/or
20% weight loss, they were humanely sacriﬁced.

To correlate the antitumor activity of AMG 925 with
pharmacodynamic activity in this systemic model, the
effect of AMG 925 on P-STAT5 and P-RB in the bone mar-
row–engrafted tumor cells was assessed in a separate

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. Mice were
injected with MOLM13-Luc cells and 14 days after injec-
tion, mice were administered two doses of AMG 925 6
hours apart. Femurs were harvested 8 and 24 hours after
the ﬁrst dose administration and processed for our IHC
staining of P-STAT5- and P-RB–positive cells. At all doses
tested, P-STAT5 was reduced to less than 3% but returned
to baseline by 24 hours after dosing (Fig. 3D; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2A). P-RB was reduced to approximately 20% at 8
and 24 hours after administration of the 37.5 mg/kg dose.
At 24 hours after dosing, a dose-dependent decrease in
inhibition of P-RB was observed (Fig. 3D; Supplementary
Fig. S2B). These data, together with the antitumor activity,
demonstrate that maximal activity of AMG 925 requires
complete inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation for at least 8
hours and 80% inhibition of RB phosphorylation for 24
hours.

AMG 925, a FLT3/CDK4 Dual Inhibitor for Treating AML

only moderate success primarily due to combined toxicity
(6, 7).

CDK4 is a well-established cancer drug target for a
broad spectrum of RB-positive cancers (23, 24). PD
0332991, a CDK4 selective inhibitor, has demonstrated
clinical efﬁcacy in treating breast cancer in combination
with letrozole (17). However, CDK4 inhibition alone
also faces potential clinical issue of resistance due to
bypassing or compensatory mechanisms, e.g., loss of
RB and increase in Cyclin E1 expression (20, 25; our
unpublished observations). AMG 925 inhibits both
FLT3 and CDK4 potentially offering a more effective
treatment for AML than single kinase selective inhibi-
tors. CDK4 activity is downstream of FLT3 signaling
and is required for cell proliferative response to FLT3
activation. However, the function of the two kinases is
not fully overlapping. As a central player in cell-cycle
regulation, CDK4 mediates signaling from other up-
stream growth factors as demonstrated by G1 arrest of
FLT3-WT AML cells treated with AMG 925 (Fig. 1C). So,
it is not surprising that inhibition of both kinases has
been shown to cooperate in inhibiting AML cell growth
(20). However, we hypothesize that CDK4-inhibiting
activity of AMG 925 primarily acts through reducing
frequency and/or expansion of mutants resistant to
FLT3-inhibiting activity of the compound. Consistently,
we have tried but failed to isolate AMG 925–resistant
FLT3 mutations in MOLM13 and Mv4-11 under condi-
tions that we used to isolate sorafenib-resistant muta-
tions (our unpublished data). A potential advantage
of AMG 925 over combining a FLT3 inhibitor with
chemotherapy is that the CDK4-inhibiting activity of
AMG 925 may be better tolerated based on the knock-
out phenotype of
targets in mice
(26, 27) and clinical trial results of the CDK4 inhibitor
PD 0332991 (28). AMG 925 may also be efﬁcacious as
a treatment for patients with AML refractory to or
relapsed from chemotherapy.

these individual

The sequence of treatments for a combination therapy
of cancer can sometimes be critical to efﬁcacy. For
example, agents causing G1 arrest of the cell cycle are
known to protect cancer cells from chemotherapies (29,
30). In contrast, it has been reported that CDK4 and
FLT3 inhibitors, when added simultaneously to AML
cells, acted cooperatively in inhibiting AML cell growth
and inducing apoptosis (20). This result was conﬁrmed
in our experiments (our unpublished observations).
Furthermore, we pretreated MOLM13 cells with
CDK4 inhibitor PD 0332991 for 24 hours to arrest cells
in G1 and then determined the effect on cell prolifera-
tion of FLT3 inhibition by sorafenib. We did not detect
signiﬁcant effect on the sensitivity of MOLM13 to sor-
afenib (our unpublished observations). However, we
could not exclude the possibility that longer G1 arrest
would eventually lead to decreased response to FLT3
inhibitors.

Analysis of relapsed AML in AC220-treated patients
has conﬁrmed two hot spots for resistance mutations in

dosing. Data, mean  SEM.

in
which growth was independent of FLT3 activity. Oral
administration of AMG 925 resulted in dose-dependent
antitumor activity with a TGI of 97% at the highest dose
tested (50 mg/kg, twice daily; Fig. 4). The ED50 was
calculated as 37 mg/kg (95% CI, 26–51). Body weight
loss was not observed. The TGI correlated with inhibi-
tion of P-RB and plasma concentrations of AMG 925
(data not shown).

Discussion

Numerous FLT3 inhibitors and multiple receptor tyro-
sine kinase inhibitors with FLT3 inhibitory activity have
been tested for treating AML. Despite transient responses,
the disease relapses quickly, diminishing the overall clin-
ical beneﬁts of the FLT3 inhibitors as monotherapy (2–5).
Several mechanisms have been described as contributing
to relapse: (i) acquired mutations in FLT3 that interfere
with inhibitor binding; (ii) increased expression of anti-
apoptotic factors like Bcl-2 and Mcl-1; (iii) elevated com-
pensatory growth factor signaling; (iv) protective micro-
environment of bone marrow; and (v) insufﬁcient FLT3
target coverage. Results from a recent phase II study of
AC220, a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor,
provide strong evidence that acquired resistance muta-
tions are primary cause of relapse in AML following FLT3
inhibitor treatments (3). All of the relapsed patients from
AC220 treatment had acquired mutations in FLT3 that
were not detected before the treatment and were con-
ﬁrmed to confer resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, including
AC220 in vitro. Considering the high intrinsic genetic
instability and heterogeneity of AML cells, it is now
generally believed that FLT3-speciﬁc inhibitors need to
be combined with other therapies to achieve the desired
clinical efﬁcacy (2). Combinations with chemotherapy
have been tested with some FLT3 inhibitors like sorafenib.
The combination treatments, however, have met with

FLT3-ITD, tyrosine kinase domain residue D835, and
gatekeeper residue F691 (3). Accumulating published
data suggest that FLT3 inhibitors may largely fall into
two groups, one represented by AC220 and sorafenib, the
other by sunitinib (31–33). The former (Type 2) are much
less active on FLT3-ITD/D835 and FLT3-ITD-F691 muta-
tions, whereas the latter (Type 1) is less affected by these
mutations. As an FLT3 kinase inhibitor, AMG 925 seems
to fall into the Type 1 group as it inhibits sorafenib-
resistant FLT3-ITD-D835Y/V mutations. In addition, our
preliminary unpublished results showed that AMG 925
similarly inhibited FLT3-ITD-D835Y and -F691I in BaF3
cells. Several kinase inhibitors with similar inhibition
proﬁles of FLT3-mutant inhibition have been reported
for having a potential to overcome AC220 resistance (34,
35). Inhibition of resistance mutations at residues D835
and F691 by AMG 925 would present a tempting option to
combine with the Type 1 inhibitors AC220/sorafenib to
enhance efﬁcacy in treating AML.

In summary, mutational resistance has been a clinical
issue of FLT3 inhibitors as monotherapy and combination
therapies are being pursued. We have demonstrated
AMG 925 in preclinical systems to be a potent, selective,
and orally bioavailable FLT3/CDK4 dual kinase inhibitor.
The compound demonstrated in vivo activity in AML
tumor models and seemed well tolerated. AMG 925 is
currently at the late stage of preclinical development.
Future clinical testing will determine the efﬁcacy of the
compound in treating FLT3-mutant AML for its potential
to cause a durable clinical response.
