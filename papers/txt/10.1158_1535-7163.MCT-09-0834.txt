Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common genetic disease affecting the nervous system. Patients
typically develop many tumors over their lifetime, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The NF1
gene, mutated in NF1, is also commonly mutated in sporadic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Because both
NF1 and GBM are currently incurable, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Natural products
represent an opportunity to develop new therapies, as they have been evolutionarily selected to play targeted
roles in organisms. Schweinfurthin A is a prenylated stilbene natural product that has previously shown
specific inhibitory activity against brain and hematopoietic tumor lines. We show that patient-derived
GBM and NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) lines, as well as tumor lines derived from
the Nf1−/+;Trp53−/+ (NPcis) mouse model of astrocytoma and MPNST are highly sensitive to inhibition by
schweinfurthin A and its synthetic analogs. In contrast, primary mouse astrocytes are resistant to the growth
inhibitory effects of schweinfurthin A, suggesting that schweinfurthin A may act specifically on tumor
cells. Stable transfection of the GTPase-activating protein related domain of Nf1 into Nf1−/−;Trp53−/− astro-
cytoma cells confers resistance to schweinfurthin A. In addition, the profound effect of schweinfurthin A
on dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton led us to discover that schweinfurthin A inhibits growth
factor–stimulated Rho signaling. In summary, we have identified a class of small molecules that specifically
inhibit growth of cells from both central and peripheral nervous system tumors and seem to act on NF1-
deficient cells through cytoskeletal reorganization correlating to changes in Rho signaling. Mol Cancer Ther;

Introduction

Historically, natural products have provided a wealth
of pharmacologically active compounds for the treatment
of disease (1). Natural products with small molecular
weight seem to function in the producing organism largely
as mediators of ecological interactions by targeting con-
served cellular pathways and processes in pathogens,
niche competitors, or symbiotic organisms (2). By screening

natural products against human disease–relevant cellular
processes such as proliferation and invasion, one can read-
ily identify bioactive compounds; however, the challenge
remains to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying
their modes of action. Here we apply these concepts to the
development of therapies for nervous system cancers that
are currently incurable.

Schweinfurthin A is a prenylated stilbene natural pro-
duct that we isolated from a plant native to Cameroon in
Africa on the basis of activity of a crude extract in the
NCI 60 cell-line assay (Fig. 1A; ref. 3). Schweinfurthin
A was identified as part of an effort to collect and char-
acterize natural products from fungi, cyanobacteria,
marine invertebrates, and >65,000 terrestrial plants at
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Natural Products
Repository. We previously showed that schweinfurthin
A produced a unique cell growth inhibition profile with
differential activity against the central nervous system
(CNS) and leukemia subpanels (3). Schweinfurthin A is
highly potent and selective, showing low nanomolar
inhibition of the growth of sensitive lines such as the
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-derived SF-295 line,
and 1,000-fold selectivity compared with resistant lines
such as the non–small cell lung cancer–derived A549.

Schweinfurthin A Inhibition of Glioma and NF1 Tumor Cells

cations, deletions, and gene expression changes in large
panels of GBMs. Two independent studies by The Cancer
Genome Atlas project and the Kinzler group at Johns
Hopkins both identified NF1 as one of the genes most
frequently mutated in sporadic GBM (7, 8). In addition,
previous studies in Nf1 and Trp53 mutant mice showed
that loss of Nf1 in combination with loss of the gene
encoding the p53 protein predisposes mice to astrocy-
toma and GBM (9, 10), indicating that NF1 likely can play
a causal role in GBM tumorigenesis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal domi-
nant genetic disorder affecting 1 in 3,500 people. NF1
patients carry a mutation in the NF1 gene (Nf1 in mice)
and the disease is 100% penetrant, but shows variable
expressivity, with patients developing a wide variety of
developmental, benign, and malignant pathologies (11).
The most common tumor types include benign optic
pathway gliomas and neurofibromas (12). NF1 patients
are at an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNST) and also develop deadly malig-
nant astrocytomas/GBMs (13, 14), in keeping with
the role of NF1 mutation in sporadic glioblastoma. In
addition, NF1 patients develop tumors not associated
with the nervous system, such as myeloid leukemia
and pheochromocytoma.

NF1 patients have a 5% to 13% lifetime risk of devel-
oping MPNSTs, an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that is
refractory to chemotherapy and the leading cause of mor-
tality in adult NF1 patients (15). MPNSTs are believed
to arise from a malignant transformation of plexiform
neurofibromas. Neurofibromas have been shown to
develop from NF1−/− Schwann cells in peripheral nerve
tracts in cooperation with other NF1−/+ cells in the sur-
rounding stroma (16–18). Many NF1 tumors have now
been successfully modeled in genetically engineered mice
(9, 10, 18–24). Mice carrying heterozygous mutations in
Nf1 and Trp53 linked on chromosome 11 (NPcis mice)
develop MPNSTs and astrocytoma/GBM with high
frequency depending on the strain background, as well
as pheochromocytomas and hematopoietic tumors
(9, 20, 23).

NF1 is a 350 kb gene that encodes a 250 kD protein,
neurofibromin (25, 26). To date, its best-characterized
function is localized in a 300-amino-acid central domain
with homology to RasGAP proteins, known as the
RasGAP-related domain (NF1-GRD; ref. 27). The domain
negatively regulates RAS by converting RAS from its
active GTP bound state to its inactive GDP bound state,
which no longer propagates signals from upstream
factors to downstream effector molecules. Thus, neurofi-
bromin functionally downregulates RAS activity, and
loss or mutation of wild-type (WT) NF1 leads to consti-
tutive RAS signaling in tumors (28).

The prevailing hypothesis is that loss of NF1 function
in cells leads to constitutive RAS signaling in cells of the
glial lineage – a critical step in the evolution of both
benign and malignant tumor cells (29–32). However,
efforts to treat both NF1 and GBM with Ras pathway

GBM is the most common and deadly brain tumor in
adults, with an average incidence rate of 3 in 100,000 (4),
and a 5-year survival rate of <5%. Lower grades of astro-
cytoma can progress to GBM, and are similarly incurable.
GBMs are highly infiltrative, making surgical resection
difficult or impossible, and thus far GBMs are highly re-
sistant to chemotherapy. Current therapeutic advances in
the treatment of GBM have focused on targeting molecu-
lar pathways upregulated in GBM, with limited success.
Specifically, analysis of completed clinical trials using
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors has
shown that these molecularly targeted therapies are highly
effective, but only in small molecularly distinct subsets of
GBMs (5, 6).

Recent large-scale genomic efforts have been under-
taken to comprehensively identify mutations, amplifi-

inhibitors, such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors, have
seen little success (33–35). It is therefore important to find
additional therapeutic candidates that inhibit NF1-
dependent pathways altered in tumorigenesis.

In addition to its role in regulating RAS effector path-
ways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and
AKT, neurofibromin also regulates Rho signaling with
downstream consequences on the organization of the
actin cytoskeleton. When NF1 expression was knocked
down in HeLa and HT1080 cells by small interfering
RNA, dramatic changes in actin regulation were
observed. It was determined that these changes were
regulated via the Rho/Rock pathway (36). Other studies
in both Schwann cells and astrocytes have shown that
NF1 heterozygosity and loss of heterozygosity result in
abnormal cytoskeletal organization, as well as defects in
migration (37–39). Given the invasive nature of GBMs
and MPNSTs, it is likely that the effect of NF1 mutation
on cytoskeleton dynamics could have important conse-
quences for tumorigenesis; however, inhibition of Rho
signaling pathways has not yet been examined as a
therapy for NF1 or GBM.

The purpose of this study was to illuminate the mecha-
nism of action of schweinfurthin A, and therefore we
chose to pursue studies in the experimentally tractable
system afforded by the NPcis mouse model of nervous
system tumors (9). Characterization of the mechanisms
of action of this compound may lead to new insights into
nervous system tumors, therefore schweinfurthin A may
serve as a lead molecule in developing novel therapies
for a class of tumors for which there are currently no
effective therapies.

Materials and Methods

Schweinfurthin A isolation and analog synthesis. The
isolation of schweinfurthin A was previously described
(3). Synthesis of schweinfurthin analogs (National Service
Center numbers 735927, 749942, 749946, and 746620) has
been previously reported (40–43).

Cell lines and culture. Human tumor lines SF-295 and
A549 were obtained from the Developmental Thera-
peutics Program (NCI-Frederick) from stocks used in
the NCI 60-cell assay (44). Mouse tumor lines were
generated from NPcis mouse tumors. The isolation of
KR158 astrocytoma was described previously (9).
K16561 and K14553 tumor lines were isolated from sar-
comas in NPcis mice, and characterized as MPNSTs by
immunocytochemistry for Schwann cell markers (S100
and p75), which were found to be positive, and muscle
markers (MyoD1 and Myf4; ref. 45), which were found
to be negative, as well as for loss of the WT copy of
Nf1 and Trp53 by PCR as described previously (ref. 9;
Supplementary Data and Methods). Primary astrocytes
were prepared as described previously (46) from 1-day-old
neonatal brains collected from WT, Nf1−/+, and Nf1−/+;
Trp53−/+cis mice. Human MPNST cell lines (STS26T
and T265) were a kind gift from Brigitte Widemann,

Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI. Human cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 and mouse cells were grown in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented
with 2 mmol/L glutamine and incubated in a 37°C hu-
midified atmosphere (5% CO2).

NF1-GRD retroviral constructs were a kind gift from
D.W. Clapp, Indiana University. Cells transduced with
the NF1-GRD construct or Murine Stem Cell Virus
(PMSCV) empty vector control as previously described
(47) were maintained in 1 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma).

All mouse procedures were done according to the
guidelines of the NCI-Frederick Animal Care and Use
Committee.

Clonogenic assays. Monolayers of cells were treated
for 18 hours with schweinfurthin A, and then harvested,
counted, and seeded to 35-mm dishes at a density of
1,000 cells/dish. After 1 week, macroscopic colonies were
stained with crystal violet (Sigma) and counted.

XTT cell proliferation assay. Cells were seeded into
96-well plates at a density of 2,000 cells/well and
allowed to reattach overnight. Cells were treated with
schweinfurthin A, synthetic analogs, camptothecin (NCI
Chemotherapeutics Repository), or DMSO control at the
indicated concentrations continuously for 48 hours fol-
lowed by assay in the 96-well plate for relative viable
cell number using the dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (XTT) and a Wallac-
Victor 2 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer). Absorbance was
determined at 450 nm with 650 nm as a reference reading.
Primary astrocytes were additionally assayed at a 96-hour
time point.

Cell morphology assays and confocal microscopy. To
assay cytoskeleton morphology, KR158 cells, mouse pri-
mary astrocytes, KR158 clones expressing the NF1-GRD
constructs, and K14553 cells were seeded to cover slips
and allowed to reattach overnight. Cells were treated
for 18 hours with either the indicated concentrations of
schweinfurthin A, or the vehicle control DMSO. The cover
slips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeablized
in 0.1% Triton-X100, and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-
phalloidin (Invitrogen) to detect actin, and cells were
mounted in Prolong Antifade containing 4′,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) to stain nuclei. The
cells were imaged on a LSM510 confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss Inc.).

For phospho-myosin light chain 2 (MLC) detection,
cells were seeded to cover slips as described above. Cells
were serum starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum and
schweinfurthin A or DMSO vehicle control for 18 hours,
and then pulsed with 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(EGF; Invitrogen) for 5 minutes. Cover slips were fixed
and permeablized as described above and immuno-
stained with a Ser19 phospho-specific MLC primary anti-
body (Cell Signaling Technology) and Alexa Fluor 555
goat anti-rabbit secondary (Invitrogen), and counter-
stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Invitrogen) to
detect actin. Cells were mounted in Prolong Gold Anti-
fade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen) to stain nuclei.

KR158 GFP-actin–transfected cells (Supplementary
Data and Methods) were seeded to 8-well chamber slides,
allowed to reattach, and then treated with indicated con-
centrations of schweinfurthin A. Actin structures were
monitored continuously over a 16-hour period using con-
focal microscopy equipped with a growth chamber (37°C,
humidified atmosphere, and 5% CO2). To compare
schweinfurthin A with Rho/Rock inhibitors, KR158
GFP-actin cells were treated with schweinfurthin A or
with the Rock inhibitor Y-27632 (Sigma) and the Rho
inhibitor C3 transferase (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) for 16 hours
and then examined by confocal microscopy.

Rho GTPase pull-down assay. The Rho pull-down
assay was obtained from Upstate Biologicals. KR158 cells
were harvested at approximately 80% confluency and
seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. After over-
night recovery, cells were serum starved in 0.5% fetal
bovine serum for 18 hours. Cells were then treated with
10 ng/mL EGF either in the presence or the absence of
the indicated concentrations of schweinfurthin A for up
to 18 hours. At the indicated time points, the cells were
lysed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Proteins
pulled down by the Rho-GTP binding beads were eluted
by SDS, fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and trans-
ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Pre-pull-down
lysates were run in parallel to determine total levels of
Rho in each sample. The membrane was probed by an
anti-Rho antibody.

Results

Schweinfurthin A shows differential activity towards
SF-295 human glioma and KR158 astrocytoma cells but
not primary astrocytes derived from WT, Nf1 −/+, and
NPcis mice. Previous data in the NCI60 cancer cell assay
showed that schweinfurthin A showed cytotoxicity in the
brain tumor subpanel (3), but the mechanism of cell inhi-
bition was not understood. To confirm the selectivity of
schweinfurthin A seen in the NCI60 assay, we used a cell
clonogenicity study in which confluent monolayers of
SF-295 GBM cells were treated for 18 hours with schwein-
furthin A. A549 lung cancer cells were used as a control
for comparison, because they show relative resistance to
schweinfurthin A compared with brain tumor lines in the
NCI-60 cancer cell assay. Schweinfurthin A–treated cells
were then rescued from the drug, harvested, and seeded
at low densities. As seen in Fig. 1B, colony growth was
dramatically restricted in the sensitive cells, whereas
the A549 cells formed colonies up to the highest concen-
tration of schweinfurthin A tested. We further characte-
rized the activity of schweinfurthin A in an aggressive
grade III astrocytoma cell line (KR158) derived from
the NPcis mouse. The human GBM line SF-295 and the
mouse astrocytoma line KR158 were compared with
the schweinfurthin A–resistant A549 lung cancer cell line
in two-day proliferation assays. Schweinfurthin A inhi-
bited both the KR158 and SF-295 cell lines in a dose-
dependent manner, with no apparent effect on the A549

cell line (Fig. 2A). The XTTassay used in these experiments
measures the metabolic activity of mitochondrial-associated
enzymes that are inactivated after cell death, and is a vali-
dated end point for measuring inhibition of proliferation.
However, because it does not measure cytotoxicity directly,
we employed a cell protease assay that measures cell
viability and cytotoxicity by detecting two distinct protease
activities simultaneously. In this assay, we saw a dose-
dependent increase in cell killing in KR158 cells after
48 hours of continuous treatment with schweinfurthin A

Figure 2. Schweinfurthin A selectively inhibits proliferation of SF-295
and KR158 brain tumor cells, but has little effect on A549 lung tumor
cells or primary astrocytes. A, viability of KR158, SF-295, and A549
cells in response to schweinfurthin A was evaluated by XTT assay and
plotted as a percentage of viable cells compared with cells treated with
vehicle only. B, viabilty of A549 cells in response to schweinfurthin A

Turbyville et al.

(Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that schweinfurthin A
acts by a cytotoxic rather than cytostatic mechanism.

To show that A549 cells are not generally resistant to
small molecule growth inhibition, we tested campto-
thecin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase 1 that induces apo-
ptosis in proliferating cells, as a positive control. A549
was sensitive to camptothecin, indicating that general
upregulated drug metabolism, or increased nonspecific
drug efflux, were not responsible for enhancing the
schweinfurthin A–insensitive tumor cell survival in the
presence of the drug (Fig. 2B).

Furthermore, untransformed astrocytes have the
capacity to proliferate, so we tested schweinfurthin A
against primary astrocytes from WT, Nf1−/+, and NPcis
neonates, and found that these cells were resistant to the
effects of schweinfurthin A on proliferation (Fig. 2C),
even after 96 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Moreover, at concentrations of schweinfurthin A
several log-fold higher than the IC50 value for KR158,
the inhibitory concentration (IC) at which the growth
activity is inhibited by 50%, primary astrocytes were
not inhibited more than roughly 40% in their growth, de-
pending on the individual astrocyte line tested (Fig. 2C).
Because primary astrocytes grow more slowly than tumor
cells, it is possible that the effects of schweinfurthin A are
limited to faster proliferating cells. To address this issue
we reexamined the response of the NCI60 cell lines to
schweinfurthin A (3). The doubling times of the NCI60
cells are well characterized and available online (48). We
found that the sensitivity to schweinfurthin A does not
correlate to the doubling time of the tumor line (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2B). Indeed, one of the slowest growing
CNS lines, SNB-75, with a doubling time of 62.8 hours,
is one of the most sensitive lines to schweinfurthin A (log-
GI50 = −7.82), whereas one of the faster growing CNS lines,
SF-268, with a doubling time of 33.1 hours, is the most
resistant CNS line to schweinfurthin A (logGI50 = −5.62).
These data suggest that schweinfurthin A activity targets
the transformed phenotype of astrocytoma cells, and not a
general feature of cell division that can be found in prolife-
rating brain cells.

Schweinfurthin A causes morphologic changes reflected
in alterations of dynamic actin architecture. Treatment
of sensitive cells with schweinfurthin A leads to changes
in cell morphology characterized by elongated processes
and contraction of the cytoplasm, resulting in an overall
spindle shape (Fig. 3A). These changes occur within the
first day of treatment with the most dramatic changes
occurring after 12 to 18 hours. Hypothesizing that
changes in the actin cytoskeleton were responsible for
the morphologic changes, we separately treated KR158
cells stably transfected with GFP-actin with the Rock
inhibitor Y-27632 or the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), both of which are known to
disrupt cytoskeletal actin structures, or with schwein-
furthin A (Fig. 3B). When compared with untreated con-
trols, there was a dramatic loss of F-actin staining in all
treated cells, especially stress fibers. In schweinfurthin

Figure 3. Schweinfurthin A causes changes in cell morphology and
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. A, phase contrast images
of KR158 cells treated overnight with DMSO (left) or schweinfurthin A
(right). B, KR158 EGFP-actin cells show a dose-dependent response
to schweinfurthin A with loss of stress fibers and an increasingly
punctuate appearance of the actin cytosleleton.

A–treated cells, in particular, we saw dose- (Fig. 3B)
and time-dependent changes (Supplementary Fig. S3B)
in the architecture of actin including loss of stress fibers,
and increased cortical actin at the margins of the cell
(Fig. 3B). Distinctively, doxorubicin-treated KR158 cells
retained stress fibers when given cytotoxic doses of the
DNA intercalating agent (data not shown), suggesting
that actin structure reorganization is not a general conse-
quence of cell stress. Finally, schweinfurthin A–resistant
primary astrocytes and A549 cells showed no visible
changes in actin organization after treatment with
schweinfurthin A as visualized by phalloidin staining
(Supplementary Figs. S2C and S3C).

Schweinfurthin A inhibits growth factor–induced Rho
signaling. The effect of schweinfurthin A on actin cyto-
skeleton dynamics, the sensitivity of Nf1−/−;Trp53−/−
astrocytoma cells to schweinfurthin A, and previously
published data which indicate that loss of NF1 enhances
stress fiber formation and Rho signaling (36) raised the
possibility that the Rho signaling pathway may be an
important determinant of schweinfurthin A sensitivity.
To test whether schweinfurthin A might be targeting the
Rho signaling network, KR158 cells were serum starved

and then pulsed with 10 ng/mL of EGF in the presence
or absence of schweinfurthin A. Using glutathione
S-transferase–fused Rhotekin-Rho binding domain to pull
down activated Rho, we observed a marked inhibition
of Rho activity at 12 and 18 hours in EGF-pulsed cells
treated with schweinfurthin A (Fig. 4A).

As further evidence that the Rho signaling pathway is
disrupted, KR158 cells treated with schweinfurthin A
and EGF were immunostained for phosphorylation of
Ser 19 on myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), which is down-
stream of Rho/Rock signaling. Ser 19 phosphorylation
has been shown to activate the regulatory function of
MLC, and is associated with stress fiber polymerization
and contractility in the actin cytoskeleton (49). Confocal
micrographs of these cells show a dose-dependent

decrease of MLC phosphorylation in schweinfurthin A–
treated cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest
that the observed cytoskeletal changes in schweinfurthin
A–sensitive cells are due to the inhibition of Rho activity,
with downstream consequences on Rho effector mole-
cules such as MLC. Because the time course of our experi-
ments show that the effects on the actin cytoskeleton,
MLC phosphorylation, and Rho activity require hours
of treatment with schweinfurthin A, it is not likely that
schweinfurthin A is acting directly within the Rho path-
way, but rather it is acting upstream, indirectly leading
to downregulation of the pathway. These data also sug-
gest loss of neurofibromin contributes to the upregula-
tion of a signaling network that links the regulation of
the actin cytoskeleton and cell survival, and that this up-
regulated network in NF1-deficient cells is targeted by
schweinfurthin A.

Figure 6. Schweinfurthin A inhibits the growth and MLC phophorylation of human and murine NF1-deficient MPNST cell lines. A, Nf1−/−;Trp53−/−
tumor lines from NPcis mice, KR158 (astrocytoma), and K16561 and K14553 (MPNST) are sensitive to inhibition by schweinfurthin A, compared with
A549 cells, as evaluated by XTT assay plotted as a percentage of cells treated with vehicle only. Points, mean percentage growth of three wells compared
with DMSO-treated controls. Top images, K14553 cells treated for 18 hours with DMSO (left) or schweinfurthin A 100 nmol/L (right) and then stained
with Alexa Fluor 488-phallodin (green) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton, and counterstained with DAPI (blue) to visualize the nucleus. B, K14553
cells show loss of phospho-MLC (red) in response to 18-hour treatment with schweinfurthin A, compared with DMSO-treated cells. Cells were
counterstained with Alexa Fluor 488-phallodin (green) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton and DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclei. C, the human MPNST cell
line T265 from a NF1 patient is sensitive to synthetic analogues of schweinfurthin A as evaluated by XTT assay (left), and the sporadic human MPNST
cell line STS26T is resistant compared with T265 (right) as measured by XTT assay.

KR158 cells transfected with the NF1-GRD domain
are resistant to schweinfurthin A. Because neurofibromin
is a very large protein, stably transfecting cells with
the full-length Nf1 gene was not feasible. Therefore,
to test whether loss of Nf1 was required for cellular
sensitivity to schweinfurthin A, we reintroduced the
∼300-amino-acid-long NF1-GRD fragment of Nf1 into
KR158 cells. Although neurofibromin may have addi-
tional functions not mediated by this domain, this
is a key fragment of the larger protein. Cells trans-
duced with this domain, or the empty vector, were
tested against schweinfurthin A in a two-day cell pro-
liferation assay. As expected, schweinfurthin A was
highly active against both the untransduced and the
empty vector–transduced KR158 cells; however, NF1-
GRD–expressing cells were resistant to schweinfurthin
A inhibition (Fig. 5A). Sequencing of the coding se-
quence corresponding to the first 1984 amino acids of
neurofibromin in SF295 cells revealed one silent muta-
tion in the N-term end of the protein (Leu234CTG >

CTA; data not shown), whereas Western blots of
SF-295 and A549 for neurofibromin showed a 250 KD
reactive band consistent with expression of neurofibro-
min in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4). We
cannot conclude that the neurofibromin expressed in
SF295 (or A549) is functional; however, we did not find
clear evidence for a mutation of NF1 in SF295 that
would alter protein function. Therefore, our evidence
suggests that schweinfurthin A targets a pathway cri-
tical for survival of NF1 null cells, but that this path-
way could also be important for the survival of other
nervous system tumors that may still express neurofi-
bromin, but use similar pathways for tumorigenesis.

Examination of the transduced cells by confocal micro-
scopy showed that the NF1-GRD–expressing clones had a
different pattern of F-actin organization from the empty
vector–transduced cells, and the actin structures within
the NF1-GRD cells did not change in response to schwein-
furthin A. The empty vector–transduced cells showed the
same reorganization of F-actin structures in response to

schweinfurthin A that was observed in untransduced
KR158 cells and other sensitive cells lines tested (Fig. 5B).
NF1–deficient tumor cells are differentially sensitive
to the antiproliferative effects of schweinfurthin A and
analogs. Given the NF1-GRD dependence of schwein-
furthin A sensitivity in astrocytoma cells, we tested
two MPNST cell lines derived from the NPcis mouse
and saw a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation
of these cells (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the effects of
schweinfurthin A on Nf1-deficent astrocytoma cells,
we also saw an effect on the actin cytoskeleton in the
MPNST cell
including loss of stress fibers
(Fig. 6A, top) and reduced MLC phosphorylation
(Fig. 6B). When schweinfurthin A was tested against
the human MPNST cell
line T265, derived from a
NF1 patient, we also saw potent inhibition of cell pro-
liferation (Fig. 6C, left). In contrast, when we measured
the effect of schweinfurthin A on a sporadic MPNST
cell line, STS-26T (50), which has been shown to ex-
press WT NF1 (51), we observed much weaker inhibi-
tion of proliferation (Fig. 6C, right). Four synthetic
analogs of schweinfurthin A (Supplementary Fig. S5)
also selectively inhibited the growth of NF1-deficient
cells (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S6). These find-
ings further support the model that schweinfurthin A
targets a signaling network that is essential for tumor
cell survival in NF1-deficient cells.

Discussion

We found that cytoskeletal rearrangements are a hall-
mark of sensitivity to schweinfurthin A, and are accom-
panied by inhibition of Rho signaling. Furthermore,
expression of NF1-GRD imparts resistance to schwein-
furthin A. These findings suggest that Nf1-deficient
tumor cells are differentially sensitive to schweinfurthin
A because of alterations in Rho signaling due to loss of
regulation by neurofibromin. This signaling network
regulates the actin cytoskeleton, but also contributes
significantly to cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. This
may explain in part the specificity of schweinfurthin A
for brain tumors and leukemia in the NCI60 cell assay,
because both astrocytoma and myeloid leukemia have
been associated with NF1 alterations.

Neurofibromin is primarily described as an inhibitor of
Ras signaling, and thus it is perhaps surprising that
Nf1−/− tumor cells show differential susceptibility to
schweinfurthin A, compared with A549 cells that carry
an activating mutation in K-ras. The specificity of
schweinfurthin A for a subset of NCI60 tumor cell lines
further supports the idea that schweinfurthin A is not
acting at the level of Ras inhibition. Our observations that
schweinfurthin A inhibits Rho signaling and causes
changes in actin dynamics in a tumor type–specific
manner indicates that the signaling pathways down-
stream of Ras may be different in nervous system tumors
than in other tumor types. This may help to explain the
highly invasive nature of astrocytomas/GBMs and

Schweinfurthin A Inhibition of Glioma and NF1 Tumor Cells

MPNSTs. Recent work by Ozawa et al. (36) showed
that in addition to its role in Ras regulation, NF1 also
regulates Rho signaling. Understanding how signaling
pathways in nervous system tumors differ from other
tumor types may provide keys to designing therapy to tar-
get brain tumors, as well as other NF1-related conditions.
NF1 patients carry a mutation of the NF1 gene in the
normal cells throughout their body. Many studies on
NF1−/+ mutant cells have shown altered signaling and
a haploinsufficient phenotype in the presence of one WT
copy of NF1 (52–54). This raises the possibility that NF1
patients may respond to therapies differently from the
general population. Furthermore, due to the nature of
the disease, NF1 patients develop tumors at a very young
age, and thus might require therapy for the condition over
extended periods of time, perhaps their entire lifetime.
Therapies developed for the treatment of NF1 will need
to be highly specific to provide a therapeutic index be-
tween the pathologic NF1−/− cells in tumors and the
NF1−/+ cells of the patient. It is therefore encouraging that
schweinfurthin A sensitivity shows dependence on Nf1
loss. Nf1 heterozygous primary astrocytes are resistant
to schweinfurthin A, whereas multiple different Nf1 nulli-
zygous tumors of the central and peripheral nervous sys-
tem are sensitive to schweinfurthin A.

Future studies will determine whether schweinfurthin
A or any of its synthetic analogs maintain potency and
specificity in vivo. For schweinfurthin A to be an effective
treatment for GBM it should be able to cross the blood
brain barrier (BBB); the ability of schweinfurthin A to
cross the BBB is unknown at this time. In contrast,
peripheral tumors associated with NF1, such as MPNSTs,
develop outside the BBB, and may be accessible to
schweinfurthin A or its analogs regardless of whether
these compounds cross the BBB. Because analogs of this
natural product can now be synthesized, it will be impor-
tant to determine which analogs are most metabolically
stable, pharmacologically active, and able to cross the
BBB. Insights into the mechanism of action of schwein-
furthin A and its analogs will help determine whether
activity is maintained in vivo.

In conclusion, we have identified a natural product,
schweinfurthin A, that phenocopies neurofibromin
effects on cell proliferation and on actin cytoskeletal regu-
lation. The study of the mechanism of tumor inhibition
by schweinfurthin A may lead to a better understand-
ing of how brain tumors differ from other more treat-
able tumor types, and may lead to a more detailed
understanding of how neurofibromin functions as a
tumor suppressor.
