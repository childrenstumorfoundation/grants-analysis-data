Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carries a significant psychosocial burden for affected individuals. 
The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of depressive symptoms among a large 
sample of adults with NF1 and to quantify the impact of depressive symptoms on QoL. This cross-
sectional study used an Internet-based questionnaire to collect data from 498 adults who self-
reported as having NF1. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, 55% of all 
participants (61% of females and 43% of males) scored above 16, indicating a high likelihood of 
clinical depression. In a multivariate regression model controlling for demographics and potential 
confounders, depressive symptoms accounted for 32% of the variance in QoL as measured by the 
Quality of Life Index. This study is the largest to date and found the highest prevalence of 
depression compared to prior studies. Our data provide more compelling evidence that individuals 
with NF1 are at increased risk for psychiatric morbidity and suggest that this population should be

QoL and accounted for nearly one-third of the variance in QoL, it is likely that effectively treating 
depression may significantly enhance QoL for individuals with NF1.

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that carries a significant psychosocial 
burden for affected individuals. Features of this neurocutaneous condition include multiple 
café-au-lait spots, skin-fold freckling, iris Lisch nodules, bony dysplasia, and neurofibromas, 
as well as predisposition to other benign and malignant tumors.1,2 NF1 is inherited in an 
autosomal dominant manner with complete penetrance, childhood onset, and wide inter- and 
intra-familial phenotypic variability. NF1 is panethnic and affects approximately 1 in 3,000 
people.1

Empirical evidence demonstrates a spectrum of psychosocial issues common in NF1. 
Aspects of NF1 that are especially challenging include the unpredictable nature of the 
disease, variability in severity of symptoms and medical complications, and vulnerability to 
stigmatization due to the highly visible and often cosmetically disfiguring features of the 
condition. Individuals with NF1 are at increased risk for experiencing social and emotional 
difficulties, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and/or body image, social 
withdrawal, difficulty forming interpersonal relationships, behavioral problems, and 
difficulties in school.3–10

Depression in particular appears to be common among individuals with NF1. Previous 
studies have found a significantly higher incidence of depression and psychiatric disorders 
among adults with NF1 compared to the general population. In a recent study of 248 adult 
patients with neurofibromatosis tumor suppressor syndrome (including 133 with NF1, the 
rest with NF2 or schwannomatosis), 37% of males and 46% of females scored at or above 
the cut-off of 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale, which 
indicates a high likelihood of clinical depression.11 In a previous study of 128 adult patients 
with NF1, one third (32.8%) had symptoms indicative of psychiatric morbidity, as assessed 
using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).12 Similarly, a 12-year longitudinal study 
of 48 adults with NF1 found that 21% met DSM-IIIR diagnostic criteria for dysthymia and 
overall one-third of patients met criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder.13 By 
comparison, an epidemiological survey of major depressive disorder in the general 
population found a lifetime prevalence of 16.2% and a 12-month prevalence of 6.6%.14

Several studies have documented reduced quality of life (QoL) among individuals with NF1. 
Three studies of adults with NF1 found that QoL was strikingly lower in all domains as 
compared to healthy norms, with the greatest impact in the emotional domains of QoL.7,9,15 
Children with NF1 were found to have similarly reduced QoL.5,6,16–18 No studies have 
explicitly measured the impact of depression on QoL among adults with NF1 using

validated instruments. However, it seems likely that depressed individuals will have lower 
QoL.

The purpose of this study was to measure the prevalence of depressive symptoms among a 
large sample of adults with NF1 and to quantify the impact of depressive symptoms on QoL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

Procedure

Measures

The study population consisted of adult men and women at least 18 years of age who self-
reported as having NF1 and were able to read and write in English. Participants were 
recruited through national NF1 organizations: Children’s Tumor Foundation and 
Neurofibromatosis Inc. These organizations advertised the study through email listservs, 
newsletter mailings, and website postings. In addition, participants were recruited from NF1 
clinical research protocols at the National Institutes of Health.

The study used a cross-sectional design with quantitative methods to collect data using a 
one-time self-administered questionnaire. The majority of participants completed the survey 
online through a secured Internet site.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the National Human Genome 
Research Institute, National Institutes of Health (Protocol # 08-HG-N144).

Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale 
(CESD).19 This widely used and validated instrument consists of 20 items that assess how 
often the respondent has experienced various emotional and behavioral symptoms of 
depression in the past week. Each item was rated on a five-point scale anchored at “rarely or 
none of the time” (0) and “most or all of the time” (4). Although the original CESD was 
rated on a four-point scale, a five-point scale was used for the purposes of this study because 
most of the other measures in the survey instrument used five-point scales, and feedback 
from pilot testing indicated that keeping the scales consistent would reduce potential for 
confusion; this was not expected to affect validity of the scale. Items with positive valence 
were reverse-scored. No missing data were tolerated, and all items were summed to yield an 
overall score, which was then converted in relation to the original scale size by multiplying 
the overall score by 0.75. Scores can range from 0–60, with higher scores indicating the 
presence of more symptomatology. Although the CESD is not a clinical diagnostic tool, a 
cutoff of 16 or greater has been shown to reliably distinguish between clinically depressed 
and non-depressed persons.20,21

Quality of life was measured using the Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI), 
which consists of two 32-item sections encompassing four domains of QoL: Health & 
Functioning, Social & Economic, Psychological & Spiritual, and Family.22,23 Respondents 
rated the degree to which they were satisfied with various aspects of life on six-point Likert 
scales anchored at “very dissatisfied” (1) and “very satisfied” (6). Corresponding importance

items were also rated on six-point Likert scales anchored at “very unimportant” (1) and 
“very important” (6). The instrument was scored by weighting the responses on the 
satisfaction items against the responses on the corresponding importance items, yielding 
scores for overall QoL and the four QoL domains. A maximum of 20% missing data was 
tolerated. Scores ranged from 0–30, with higher scores indicating higher QoL. Although the 
QLI has not been applied in an NF1 population, it has been employed in studies of 
populations with achondroplasia24 and Marfan syndrome25 as well as a wide range of non-
genetic, chronic illness populations. The QLI has been shown to be reliable and valid. From 
a conglomeration of studies using the QLI, Cronbach’s alpha values for the QLI total scale 
ranged from 0.73 to 0.99 across 48 studies.26

The survey instrument also contained face-validity questions to gather information about 
demographics and potential confounders.

Statistical Analyses

Data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Each 
potential confounder was tested as a predictor of the outcome variable using a Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient, ANOVA or t-test. Any variables that resulted in a p-value ≤ 0.20 
were considered as candidates for inclusion in all subsequent multivariate regression 
models. Multivariate regression modeling was used to test for the association of one 
covariate on the outcome measure while controlling for other covariates.

RESULTS

During the recruitment period from June to August 2008, a total of 498 individuals meeting 
eligibility criteria completed the survey in its entirety. The average age of participants was 
38.9 ± 11.4 years and ranged from 18 to 69 years. Approximately three-quarters (73%) of 
participants were female. Demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1.

Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale 
(CESD), which demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.94). Possible scores 
range from 0 (low levels of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high levels of depressive 
symptoms). The mean CESD score for the entire study population was 20.41 ± 13.04 (95% 
CI: 19.20, 21.63). Level of depressive symptoms was significantly higher among women 
than men (p = 0.002). The mean CESD score among women was 21.67 ± 13.14 (95% CI: 
20.19, 23.14), and the mean CESD score among men was 17.23 ± 12.47 (95% CI: 14.98, 
19.49). Sixty-one percent of women and 43% of men (55% of total study population) scored 
at or above the threshold score of 16, indicating that they had a significant level of 
depressive symptoms and therefore are at increased risk for clinical depression (Figure 1).

QoL was measured using the Quality of Life Index (QLI), which has a range of possible 
scores from 0 to 30. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that all of the subscales and the overall 
measure were significantly correlated with one another (p<0.001); therefore, the total QLI 
score was used in further analyses and hypothesis testing, in lieu of individual subscales. 
Total QLI demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93). The mean total QLI

score was 18.88 ± 4.62 (95% CI: 18.48, 19.29), with higher scores indicating better overall 
QoL. Figure 2 depicts the distribution of overall QLI scores and the normal curve.

Bivariate analysis demonstrated that level of depressive symptoms was significantly 
negatively associated with overall QoL (Pearson’s correlation = −0.711, p<0.001). To 
estimate the amount of variance in QoL explained by depression, a regression model 
containing CESD score and demographics/potential confounding variables was created. 
CESD score was treated as a continuous variable, whereas the demographics and potential 
confounders were dichotomized. All variables that were found to be significantly associated 
with overall QoL at the p<0.2 level in the bivariate analyses (independent samples t-tests, 
data not shown) were entered into a regression model with QoL as the dependant variable. 
The variables included in the regression model were depressive symptoms (CESD score), 
partnered marital status, annual income greater than $30,000, college graduate education 
level, disabled employment status, learning disabilities, chronic pain, and positive family 
history. Having biological children, though not significant at p<0.2, was included because it 
may be conceptually relevant. Gender was also included in the model due to the significant 
association with depressive symptoms, even though gender was not significantly associated 
with QoL in bivariate analysis. The R-squared for the regression model that included all 
confounders and demographics was 0.598 (Table 2). When depressive symptoms was 
excluded, the model R-squared fell to 0.283, indicating that depression (level of depressive 
symptoms) accounted for approximately 32% of the variance in overall QoL (R-squared 
change = 0.315).

DISCUSSION

One of the most striking findings is the prevalence of depressive symptoms in this 
population of adults affected with NF1. Although the CESD is not a diagnostic tool, the 
cutoff score of 16 on the CESD has been shown to reliably distinguish between clinically 
depressed and non-depressed persons.20,21 Over half of the individuals in this study 
population (55%) scored above this threshold, indicating that they had a significant level of 
depressive symptoms and therefore are at increased risk for clinical depression. The current 
study is the largest to date and found the highest prevalence of depression compared to prior 
studies, in which depression and other psychiatric disorders were reported in 21–46%.11–13 
Our data provide more compelling evidence that individuals with NF1 are at increased risk 
for psychiatric morbidity and suggest that this population should be screened for depression.

Depression (degree of depressive symptoms) was found to be strongly correlated with QoL, 
with an effect size of 32%, meaning that nearly one-third of the variation in overall QoL can 
be explain by level of depressive symptoms. Individuals with higher levels of depressive 
symptoms had significantly poorer QoL, a finding that also has direct clinical implications. 
Because depression was found to be associated with QoL, it is likely that recognizing and 
effectively treating depression may significantly enhance QoL for individuals with NF1.

Current guidelines for the management of NF1 patients focus primarily on the medical 
aspects of the condition with only brief mention of psychological problems.2 Screening for 
depressive symptoms should be added to the list of standard management recommendations.

While it is unknown whether depressive symptoms are a manifestation of the disorder or a 
secondary reaction to living with the condition, the high prevalence suggests the former 
given the wide variability in manifestations and degree of potential stigmatization. 
Neurologists and other clinicians caring for NF1 patients should be trained to routinely 
evaluate patients for depression as a highly prevalent aspect of living with the condition.

The finding of a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in this population adds to existing 
evidence that individuals with NF1 may be at increased risk for depression and has profound 
clinical implications, especially given the adverse effect on QoL. It is important for 
healthcare providers to routinely screen for clinical depression among patients with NF1 and 
facilitate appropriate psychiatric treatment. While both genders should be screened for 
depression, it is even more important among women since they may have higher levels of 
depressive symptoms than men.

A limitation of this study was that clinical data were not collected. The diagnosis of NF1 
was not confirmed by medical record review, and depression/depressive symptoms were not 
clinically assessed. Because this study was cross-sectional, conclusions could only be drawn 
regarding associations between variables, but not about causal pathways or temporal 
relationships. Another limitation of this study is the recruitment methods. As the majority of 
participants were drawn from NF organizations and through the NIH clinical research 
protocols, this might have biased the findings in favor of individuals who actively seek out 
support groups and/or participation in research. It is possible that those individuals differ in 
important ways from individuals not involved in NF activities. On the other hand, the 
demographic data suggest that a wide range of the population was captured. One important 
exception is the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the study sample (88% White); NF1 
occurs with approximately equal frequency in all ethic populations, so the views of under-
represented minorities may not have been adequately captured. Also, women were over-
represented (73% female respondents), and NF1 is a disease that affects both genders 
equally.

Our findings are important not only in alerting providers to screen for depressive symptoms 
in patients with NF1 but can also inform clinical research. Studies can be designed to assess 
the efficacy of screening for depression including patients’ acceptance of treatment 
interventions that may not only improve their mood state but also their quality of life. Data 
following up on our findings may eventually lead to improvement in well-being for persons 
affected with NF1.

Figure 1. Depression Scores
Histograms depicting Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD) scores for 
males and females. Possible CESD scores range from 0–60, with higher scores indicating 
the presence of more symptomatology. A cutoff of 16 or greater (indicated by dotted line) 
has been shown to reliably distinguish between clinically depressed and non-depressed 
persons.20,21
