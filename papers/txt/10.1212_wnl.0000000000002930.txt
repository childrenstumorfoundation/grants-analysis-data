The neurofibromatoses (NFs) can result in substantial morbidity in affected patients. In order to
accelerate the development of effective therapies for NF-related tumor and nontumor manifesta-
tions, the development of standardized meaningful outcome measures for clinical trials is critical.
The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International
Collaboration was established with the goal to develop consensus recommendations for outcome
measures and endpoints in future NF trials and provided the first set of recommendations in
a Neurology® supplement in 2013. This second supplement updates on clinical trials that have
incorporated the recommended measures and provides new recommendations for (1) standard-
ized and specific cognitive assessment tools for use in NF clinical trials, (2) patient-reported
outcome measures including pain and physical functioning, (3) functional outcome measures
for airway plexiform neurofibromas, (4) the use of whole-body MRI in NF, and (5) the development
of biomarkers in NF and guidelines for collection of biospecimens and establishment of biobanks
for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis. Through
engagement of the NF research community, regulatory agencies, NF advocacy groups, industry,
and patients with NF, REiNS will provide a framework for comprehensive review of these recom-
mendations, continue development of outcome measures relevant to patients, and compare
results of trials, which use identical outcome measures. Neurology® 2016;87 (Suppl 1):S1–S3

GLOSSARY
NF 5 neurofibromatosis; NF1 5 neurofibromatosis 1; NF2 5 neurofibromatosis 2; NRS-11 5 Numeric Rating Scale–11;
PRO 5 patient-reported outcomes; REiNS 5 Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis.

The NFs—including NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis—are genetic tumor-predisposition
syndromes characterized by the development of multiple tumor manifestations, in particular
nerve sheath tumors, for most of which no standard treatment options other than surgery exist.1–3
In addition, patients with NF can develop multiple nontumor manifestations, affecting many
organ systems, which can result in substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. There is an
unmet need for effective medical therapies for NF-related manifestations. Differences between
NF-related tumors and nonsyndromic solid cancers have limited the applicability of clinical trial
designs used in oncology trials to the development of trials for NF.4

The REiNS International Collaboration was established in 2011 with the primary goal to
achieve consensus within the NF community for outcome measures and endpoints for future
NF trials. A description of the REiNS International Collaboration and its 7 working groups
and initial recommendations of 4 working groups were published previously in Neurology.5–10
In brief, the imaging working group provided recommendations for the use of MRI with
volumetric analysis to evaluate response in clinical trials targeting histologically benign nerve
sheath tumors such as plexiform neurofibromas and vestibular schwannomas.5 The patient-
reported outcomes (PRO) working group described their approach for the objective selection of
PRO measures in NF trials, and they recommended the use of Numeric Rating Scale–11 (NRS-
11) as a measure of pain intensity for manifestations associated with pain.10 The visual outcomes
working group recommended the use of visual acuity as primary endpoint in clinical trials for

optic pathway gliomas as opposed to measure-
ment of tumor size.6 Finally, the functional
outcomes working group provided recommen-
dations for hearing response measured by word
recognition as primary endpoint in trials for
NF2-related vestibular schwannomas.7 Since
the publication of these recommendations in
2013, a number of ongoing clinical trials have
incorporated these outcome measures.

Incorporation of REiNS-recommended outcome measures
into ongoing clinical trials. Imaging response in clinical
trials. The phase II trials of the MEK inhibitor PD-
0325901 (NCT02096471),
the receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor cabozantinib (NCT02101736), and
the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (NCT01362803)11
directed at NF1-related inoperable plexiform neuro-
fibromas are using volumetric MRI analysis and the
response criteria provided by REiNS to define the
activity of the agents under investigation. Several clinical
trials directed at NF2-related vestibular schwannomas
have also used volumetric MRI analysis to sensitively
monitor changes in tumor size as a trial endpoint
(NCT01207687, NCT01767792, NCT01419639,
NCT00973739).

Patient-reported outcomes. Pain is a common and
debilitating manifestation in NF-related tumors that is
often difficult to treat. The evaluation of pain intensity
using the NRS-11 scale has been incorporated into 5
ongoing trials with targeted investigational therapies for
NF-related plexiform neurofibromas (NCT02390752,
NCT02096471, NCT01362803, NCT02407405,
NCT02101736) and in one treatment trial target-
ing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(NCT02008877).12

Subsequent recommendations by the PRO work-
ing group for measures of physical functioning using
the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Infor-
mation System scale (provided in this supplement)
have already been incorporated in (1) 2 treatment
trials
for NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas
(NCT01362803, NCT02407405);
(2) behavioral
intervention trials of acceptance and commitment ther-
apy (NCT01633008, NCT02471339) and resilience
training (NCT02387177); and (3) assessment of psy-
chosocial outcomes (NCT02435628). The PRO group
has also initiated trials to validate the English version of
the Pain Interference Index and the Pain Rating Scale in
NF1 (NCT01639950), the adolescent PROMIS com-
puterized adaptive test in NF1 and NF2, to explore
modifications to the NRS-11, Pain Interference Index,
and PROMIS–Physical Functioning, and to make these
measures available electronically (NCT02544022).

Visual outcomes. The development and progression
of orbital plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 results

in vision loss in the affected eye in many patients.
In a phase II clinical trial of the MEK inhibitor
selumetinib (NCT01362803) for inoperable NF1
plexiform neurofibromas, vision measurements as
recommended by the visual outcomes group have
been incorporated as a measure of clinically meaning-
ful improvement. These measures are also used in an
ongoing longitudinal natural history study of NF1
optic pathway tumors.

Functional outcomes. The measurement of word rec-
ognition as a direct measure of clinical benefit in pa-
tients with NF2 and vestibular schwannomas resulting
in hearing loss has been incorporated as a primary trial
endpoint into 2 multi-institutional phase II trials of bev-
acizumab (NCT01207687, NCT01767792), and as
a secondary trial endpoint into phase II trials of everoli-
mus13 (NCT01419639), lapatinib14 (NCT00973739),
and axitinib (NCT02129647). Recommendations for
outcome measures for plexiform neurofibromas affecting
the airway in NF1, which are provided in this second
supplement, have been incorporated in the ongoing
phase II trial of selumetinib for NF1-related plexiform
neurofibromas for the subset of patients with airway
tumors (NCT01362803). These recommendations will
also be incorporated as the primary endpoint in a planned
phase II study of imatinib for NF1-related airway plex-
iform neurofibromas.

The incorporation of REiNS recommendations
into multiple trials reflects broad acceptance of REiNS
recommendations by the NF research community and
will allow for meaningful comparisons of results across
trials.

Additional REiNS recommendations provided in this
supplement. This second supplement presents recom-
mendations of 4 REiNS working groups developed
since 2013.

Neurocognitive working group. NF1 is associated with
neurocognitive deficits, which can affect everyday
functioning of children, adolescents, and adults with
this disease. The working group describes its approach
to the identification of standardized and specific cogni-
tive assessment tools for use in NF clinical trials and
provides recommendations for measurement of atten-
tion as a domain of high priority for clinical trials.

Patient-reported outcomes. The PRO group continues
to address the complex subjective nature of pain by
addressing multiple domains of importance to pa-
tients. The group provides recommendations for
assessment of pain intensity, pain interference, and
physical functioning in clinical trials for NF.

Functional

outcomes. The

functional outcomes
working group proposes outcome measures for sleep
and pulmonary function for the subgroup of patients
with NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas affecting
the airway.

Whole-body MRI. Given that nerve sheath tumors
can affect multiple body regions in patients with
NF, whole-body MRI has been used by several inves-
tigators to assess total body tumor burden. The
whole-body MRI working group presents a systematic
review of the use of whole-body MRI and highlights
areas in need of further study.

Biomarker working group. There is a great need for
the development of validated biomarkers in NF.
The biomarker working group provides a review of
existing biomarkers in NF and proposes standard
operating procedures and a minimal clinical dataset
for future biomarker studies in this supplement.

Future goals and plans. The goal of REiNS is to con-
tinue the development of outcome measures of NF
manifestations in clinical trials. Currently, groups
are working to establish consensus recommendations
for outcome measures for trials addressing bony man-
ifestations in NF, to validate and compare 2 methods
of volumetric MRI analysis of plexiform neurofibro-
mas, and to develop guidelines for the assessment of
malignant transformation of NF1-related tumors.
Through biannual meetings open to the NF
research community and with participation by the
Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines
Agency, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program,
NF advocacy groups, and industry, REiNS will seek
feedback for ongoing recommendations and guidance
for new initiatives. Importantly, REiNS is actively
exploring how best to involve patients and caregivers
into this process of developing endpoints most
relevant to patients. Over the next few years, results
of trials using REiNS outcome measures will be
published.

NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis are rare condi-
tions and novel approaches to drug development are
needed. Although the number of clinical trials for
NF has increased in recent years, large, randomized
studies are not currently feasible. However, by using
similar eligibility criteria and identical outcome
measures, the NF community hopes to promote
meaningful comparisons of agents across clinical
trials.
