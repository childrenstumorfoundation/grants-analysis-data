Abstract
Blood samples from 125 unrelated fami-
lies with classical type 2 neurofibromato-
sis
vestibular
schwannomas have been analysed for
mutations in the NF2 gene. A further 17
families fulfilling modified criteria for
NF2 have also been analysed. Causative
mutations have been identified in 54 (43%)
classical families and six (35%) of those
fulfilling
Forty-two
cases from 38 families with truncating
mutations had an average age at onset of
symptoms of 19 years and diagnosis at 22.4
years. Fifty-one cases from 16 families
with splice site mutations (15 from six),
missense mutations (18 from six), and
large deletions (18 from five) had an aver-
age age of onset of 27.8 years and at diag-
nosis
with
truncating mutations were significantly
more likely to have symptoms before 20
years of age (p<0.001) and to develop at
least two symptomatic CNS tumours in
addition to vestibular schwannoma before
30 years (p<0.001). There were also sig-
nificantly fewer multigenerational fami-
with truncating mutations. Four
lies
further truncating mutations were in
mosaic form and were associated with
milder disease than other similar muta-
tions.

This large study has confirmed the pre-
vious impression that truncating muta-
tions are associated with severe disease,
but caution has to be exercised in using
mutation type to predict disease course.

Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is an auto-
somal dominantly inherited condition charac-
terised by the development of bilateral vestibu-
lar schwannomas, schwannomas of other
cranial, spinal, and cutaneous nerves, and cra-
nial and spinal meningiomas.' 3 In 1987, the
National Institutes of Health Consensus Meet-
ing set out firm diagnostic criteria for NF2.'
These criteria meant that any person with
bilateral vestibular schwannomas was assumed
to have the disease and that 50% of offspring
would be predicted to be affected. The NF2
gene was isolated in 19935 6 and there have

been a number of reports of germline muta-
tions in large series of affected cases since that
time.` Although detection rates using SSCP
or DGGE have in general been disappointingly
low, even in classically affected people, some
evidence for a genotype/phenotype correlation
appears to be emerging.8'- We report here for
the first time the largest single study of correla-
tions between mutational type and disease
phenotype in NF2.

Patients and methods
Subjects with classical NF2 (bilateral VS) have
been ascertained by our centres since 1989.
Blood samples have been obtained from
affected subjects from 125 unrelated families.
Clinical data have been meticulously sought
and most families have been seen by the corre-
sponding author (91/125). Full information
including scan data was available on 201
subjects from the 125 families. Patients who
had died before the study were excluded from
the main analysis. Data specifically recorded
were: age at onset of the first clearly related
symptom from a CNS tumour, age at diagnosis
of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS), or
NF2 and the presence of other non-VS
tumours either symptomatic or on scan.
Although age at onset of cutaneous tumours
was sought, this was not included as represent-
first symptom. Although cutaneous
ing a
associated with more severe
tumours are
disease,2
they may occur many years before
the onset of significant CNS tumours and very
rarely contribute in themselves to disease
severity. Many patients also find it hard to re-
collect accurately when they first noticed a skin
tumour. Ophthalmic data were also collected;
however, age at onset of a cataract was also
excluded as representing a first symptom.
Cataracts again are rarely a cause of serious
morbidity in NF2 and are often found inciden-
tally at routine eye checks. Disease severity in
NF2 is related to early onset, number, and
growth rate of CNS tumours. Therefore the
following details were analysed. (1) Age at

Families were arbitrarily categorised as mild,
intermediate, or severe on the basis of having
presented after 30 years, between 20 and 30
years, or before 20 years. Those subjects
presenting before 30 years, but who had fewer
than three other non-VS symptomatic tumours
by 30 years of age, were considered mildly
affected. These criteria have been modified
slightly from our previous publications2 3 and
some families on re-evaluation have been
reclassified
All
subjects had undergone cranial imaging with
MRI and the majority had undergone full spi-
nal imaging. Any person with more than 10
tumours >0.5 cm on scan was considered
severely affected. As previous classifications
have been arrived at before the ability to detect
tiny (1-2 mm) tumours, some modification is
necessary if scan data are to be included. Cur-
rent evidence would suggest that 75-90% of
NF2 cases will have evidence of spinal tumours
on MRI.8R l Many of these tumours will remain
small and never become symptomatic. As a
measure of severity, only tumours >0.5 cm
have therefore been included. The great major-
ity of patients have had some form of ophthal-
mological assessment. While this involved slit
lamp examination, in most cases full assess-
ment for retinal hamartomas and other features
such as epiretinal membranes was sparse.

In addition to the 125 classical families,
samples from 17 subjects fulfilling modified
criteria for NF2 (table 1)2 and 87 subjects
thought to be at risk of NF2, but not fulfilling
criteria, were analysed as below.

MUTATION ANALYSIS
Genomic DNA samples prepared from periph-
eral blood were amplified with primers for all
17 exons of the NF2 gene, using primers previ-
ously described.5 12 PCR reactions were per-
formed in a total reaction volume of 25 gl using
100 ng genomic DNA, 20 pmol of each primer,
200 gm of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate,
0.5 U Thr polymerase (Northumbria Biologi-
cals Ltd), and 1 x reaction buffer (Northum-
bria Biologicals Ltd) overlaid with mineral oil.
Amplification was performed on a PCR 480
Perkin Elmer Cetus machine (35 cycles of
95°C for 90 seconds, 50°C for 90 seconds, and
72°C for 30 seconds followed by a final elonga-
tion step of 72°C for 10 minutes).

SSCP analysis was carried out by Hydrolink-
MDE gel (AT Biochem) electrophoresis ac-
cording to the supplier's instructions. Samples
for SSCP analysis (3 ,ul of PCR product) were
diluted with 3 ,ul of a solution containing 95%
formamide, 20 mmol/l EDTA, 20 mmol/l
NaOH, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05%
xylene cyanol, and denatured at 95°C for three
minutes. Electrophoresis was carried out on 24
cm vertical and 1 mm thick gels at a constant
voltage of 250 V for 13-16 hours. Gels were sil-
ver stained by sequential incubations in 10%

ethanol and 0.5% acetic acid (2 x 3 minutes),
0.1% silver nitrate (15 minutes), 1.5% NaOH
and 0.15% formaldehyde (20 minutes), and
0.75% sodium carbonate (10 minutes), and
photographed as appropriate.

The last 13 mutations have been identified
using a modification of the above technique in
the Manchester laboratory.13

Patients homozygous for two polymorphic
markers within intron 14 15 were investigated
for deletions by hybridising EcoRI and NotI
(pulsed field) genomic Southern blots with
NEFH (neurofilament heavy chain gene), LIF
(leukaemia inhibitory factor gene), and NF2
gene probes (Trueman et al, in preparation).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analyses were undertaken using methods
appropriate to dependent data, accounting for
within family correlation."6 For the comparison
of proportions, intracluster correlation coeffi-
cients were estimated for each end point and an
adjusted chi squared statistic calculated; p val-
ues were calculated from tables. Age distribu-
tions and mean numbers were compared using
Wilcoxon rank sum test, with family specific
mean ages as the unit of analysis. Two sided p
values are reported.

Results
A total of 54 causative mutations have been
identified from the 125 classically affected
unrelated subjects (43%). These consist of 22
nonsense mutations, 11 small frameshift dele-
tions, one in frame deletion, three frameshift
insertions, five missense mutations, six splice
site mutations, one 3' untranslated region
mutation, and five large deletions (table 2).
Index (first affected) cases were unavailable for
analysis in 20 families. In the 46 families that
have had an affected second generation, 26
mutations (57%) have been identified. Of the
79 sporadically affected subjects, mutations
have only been identified in 28 (35%). This

compared to 13/17 of the other mutational
types. The four further truncating mutations in
mosaic form were associated with milder
disease than other similar mutations. As only
one case from one family had an in frame dele-
tion, this was excluded from the analysis.

The clinical data are summarised in table 3.
Forty-two cases from 38 families with truncat-
ing mutations (nonsense, small frameshifting
insertions, and deletions, excluding mosaics)
had an average age at onset of symptoms of 19
years and diagnosis at 22.4 years (mosaic cases
were excluded). Fifty-one cases from 17 fami-
lies with splice site mutations (15 from six),
missense mutations (18 from six), and large
deletions (18 from five) had a later average age
of onset of 27.8 years (p<0.01) and at diagno-
sis of 33.4 years (p<0.05). Subjects with trun-
cating mutations were significantly more likely
to have symptoms before 20 years of age
(p<0.001) and develop at least two sympto-
matic CNS tumours in addition to vestibular
schwannoma before 30 years (p<0.001). Sig-
nificant results were also obtained for indi-
vidual differences between missense, splice
site, and large deletion families and truncating
mutations for all these parameters (p<0.0 125),
causing symptoms <20 years
except
(p=0.02(missense)-0.06(splice
site)). How-
ever, four asymptomatic splice site mutation
carriers were excluded as they had not reached
20 years of age. There were also significantly
fewer multigenerational families with truncat-
ing mutations. Only 9/38 non-mosaic families
had resulted in a second affected generation
Table 3 Analysis of clinicalfindings in NF2 patients with frameshift versus other mutation types

Nine affected subjects from families with
nonsense and frameshifting mutations have
died. Six died before the study at 37,39,34,35,
46, and 30 years of age. Three have died since
the start of the study at 23, 32, and 42 years of
age. Five subjects with splice site mutations
have died at 20, 26, 29, 34, and 46 years of age
and four with missense mutations have died at
45, 64, 72, and 78 years of age. The latter three
cases died in old age, deaf but with no diagno-
sis of NF2 or eighth nerve tumours during
life.22 Five subjects with large deletions have
died at 34,37,34,36, and 52 years of age. Two
with truncating mutations have been diagnosed
presymptomatically, one on DNA testing at 2
years of age and the other with bilateral
vestibular schwannomas on scan at 9 years of
age. Five subjects with splice site mutations
were diagnosed without symptoms at 6, 9, 10,
and 14 years of age on DNA testing and one on
scan at 19 years of age. The DNA tested
subjects remain CNS tumour free one to two
years later. Four with missense mutations have
been diagnosed on DNA testing alone aged 10,
13, 23, and 30 years of age. Two of these have
had subsequent negative complete neuroaxis

in a third showed a small unilateral vestibular
schwannoma at 30 years of age. Seven subjects
with large deletions were diagnosed presymp-
tomatically, four on MRI scans at 12, 22, 25,
and 29 years of age and three on DNA alone at
6, 9, and 13 years of age. The 13 year old has
had a cranial MRI at 16 years which showed
vestibular
bilateral
schwannomas. Thus, only 2/18 subjects diag-
nosed presymptomatically had nonsense or
frameshifting mutations even though these are
the most common abnormality.

Mean age at onset of symptoms, hearing
loss, and diagnosis in the 104 classically
affected NF2 cases with no identified mutation
was 23.4, 25.5, and 28 years respectively. This
is not fundamentally different from the non-
truncating mutations, but significantly later
than for frameshift and nonsense mutations.

Discussion
Since the first reports of germline mutations in
NF2, there have been attempts to establish a
link between the specific NF2 mutation and
22 A general
the
impression was that protein truncating muta-
tions produced a more severe phenotype while
certain splice site and missense mutations were
associated with mild disease.7 18 19 22 Two recent
papers have confirmed this impression on
larger surveys of mutation proven subjects.8 9
However, clear statistical evidence for this has
only been provided for data on age at onset,
diagnosis, and hearing loss between nonsense
and frameshifting mutations and splice site
mutations.8 The present study confirms the age
site and
related differences between splice
truncating mutations as well as providing
statistical evidence for the first time for a
milder disease course in families with missense
mutations and large deletions. While some
splice site mutations could lead to the produc-
tion of a truncated protein by allowing read
through of intronic sequence and introduction
of a premature stop codon, and nonsense
mutations could be ameliorated by skipping of
the affected exon, we believe the subdivision is
in general accurate. The weighted analysis
allowing for intrafamilial correlation also pro-

number of meningiomas, spinal tumours, and
skin tumours in contrast to the previous
report.8 Although statistical evidence for a dif-
ference between 28 cases with protein truncat-
ing mutations and 16 cases from three families
with single amino acid changes was found in
one study,9 this was based on classification into
disease type alone. No specific data on age and

classification of subjects into mild and severe
phenotypes is somewhat arbitrary and in many
cases not possible, thus the further breakdown
into intermediate or moderate cases.9 Nonethe-

ing one with negative full neuroaxis imaging in

carriers. The large deletions are likely to lead to
complete absence of protein product as they
affect the 5' end of the gene. We have previously
reported 1/5 of these as being mildly affected2'
and the original report on cloning the NF2
gene relied on a 40 kb deletion in a mildly
affected family.6 8 This latter deletion causes an
in frame deletion of two exons and could
therefore produce a stable protein product. It is

deletions which give rise to a near normal pro-
tein product or no protein product are
associated with mild disease, whereas those
that cause a truncated protein cause severe dis-
ease. This hypothesis has previously been put
forward for familial adenomatous polyposis.23
Whether abnormal binding of the wild type
protein by a truncated protein could cause a
similar pattern in NF2 remains to be proven.

In addition to the data on age at onset there
appears to be a clear effect on genetic fitness;
only 9/38 families with nonsense or frameshift-
ing mutations had resulted in a second affected
generation, whereas 13/17 of the other muta-
tional types resulted in multigenerational fami-
lies. This difference was not seen in a report of
21 mutations,8 but 8/8 splice site or missense
mutations where family history was known
were multigenerational, compared to only 6/22
truncating mutations in another report.9 This
difference was not specifically referred to in the
report although comments were made about
the small number of subjects from families with
truncating mutations who were diagnosed
presymptomatically.9 This is very similar to our
own findings where only 2/18 presymptomatic
diagnoses were made in the truncating muta-
tion families. This could of course be partly
explained by the smaller family sizes, but
earlier age of onset would be another major
contributing factor.

This report documents the NF2 phenotype
in 60 unrelated, mutation proven families
compared to a combined 57 from the two pre-
vious largest reports.8 9 One report did not give
clinical data on six further families.9 However,
the mutation detection rate in the present
report is low (43%) compared to 66% and 56%
in the two previous large studies,8 9 although
better than in two others.7 18 It is not clear why
this should be the case as similar techniques
were used. However, the present study has a
high number of sporadic cases which could
represent low level mosaicism."3 Detection
rates in our familial cases (56%) were compa-
rable to the other studies.8 9 We have previously
reported
proven
mosaicism13 178 and it does appear that these
are associated with a milder phenotype. It is
also possible that the failure to detect muta-
tions
a
previous study8 could have been partly ex-
plained by mosaicism. There is currently no
evidence to suggest that there are NF2 cases
caused by mutations at another locus and all
our families with no proven mutation are con-
sistent with linkage to NF2.

to have mutations. Although the numbers were
small this would suggest that modified criteria
are not overinclusive. The presence of a unilat-
eral VS would make schwannomatosis not
caused by NF2 very unlikely24 and the presence
of at least two NF2 manifestations in patients
with multiple meningiomas would also dis-
count overlap with meningiomatosis. However,
it is likely that these criteria will identify a
number of mosaic cases, as has been predicted
for classical sporadic disease."

A number of mutations are reported here for
the first time. Fifteen are novel, but we have
found three further mutations each of the
C586>T and C1021>T nonsense mutations
making these "warm" spots in the NF2 gene.
The C1021>T mutation has been reported in
at least 10 further families7'9 making it the most
common NF2 mutation. We have also con-
firmed the high frequency of C>T transitions
at CGA codons." These occurred in 15/125
(12%) classically affected cases, with other
C>T transitions occurring in a further 4% (5).
There is no evidence that these are founder
mutations, with most cases being de novo. All
the other nonsense and frameshifting muta-
tions would be predicted to give rise to a trun-
cated protein product and it is of note that our
most 3' truncating mutation in exon 15 gives
rise to classical disease. There is no real
evidence to suggest that the more 3' mutations
produce a milder form of NF2. The only new
missense mutation reported here (A229>G)
segregates with disease and has not been found
in any normal samples tested or reported as a
polymorphism elsewhere. The same is true for
the exon 5 and 7 splice site mutations reported
here for the first time. There was one mutation
identified in the 3' untranslated region. The
effect of this mutation is unknown. In contrast
to a previously reported mutation in this
region,9 the phenotype was mild. The large
deletions will be reported in detail elsewhere
(Trueman et al, in preparation).

This report has confirmed the previously
described genotype/phenotype correlations in
NF2. In addition these have been extended to
include families with large deletions which, in
general, have a milder disease than truncating
mutations. However, caution must be exercised
in giving advice to families based on the identi-
fication of a truncating or non-truncating
mutation in a single person. Even in established
families there is still significant intrafamilial
variability in disease course. Indeed mono-
zygotic twins with NF2 can have some
variation in tumour burden.26 Nonetheless the
identification of missense mutations, splice site
mutations, and large deletions in some families
is clearly consistent with a milder phenotype
and could lead
different management
decisions.27
