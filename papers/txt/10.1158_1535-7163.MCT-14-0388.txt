Abstract

Resistance to FLT3 inhibitors is a serious clinical issue in
treating acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AMG 925, a dual
FLT3/CDK4 inhibitor, has been developed to overcome this
resistance. It is hypothesized that the combined inhibition of
FLT3 and CDK4 may reduce occurrence of the FLT3 resistance
mutations, and thereby prolong clinical responses. To test this
hypothesis, we attempted to isolate AML cell clones resistant to
AMG 925 or to FLT3 inhibitors. After a selection of over 8
months with AMG 925, we could only isolate partially resistant
clones. No new mutations in FLT3 were found, but a 2- to
3-fold increase in total FLT3 protein was detected and believed
to contribute to the partial resistance. In contrast, selection with
the FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib or AC220 (Quizartinib), led to a

resistance and the appearance of a number of mutations in
FLT3 kinase domains, including the known hot spot sites D835
and F691. However, when AC220 was combined with the
CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 (palbociclib) at 0.1 mmol/L or
higher, no resistance mutations were obtained, indicating that
the CDK4-inhibiting activity of AMG 925 contributed to the
failure to develop drug resistance. AMG 925 was shown to
potently inhibit the FLT3 inhibitor–resistant mutation D835Y/
V. This feature of AMG 925 was also considered to contribute to
the lack of resistance mutations to the compound. Together,
our data suggest that AMG 925 has the potential to reduce
resistance mutations
in FLT3 and may prolong clinical
responses. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(2); 375–83. Ó2014 AACR.

Introduction

Approximately 25% of patients with acute myelogenous leu-
kemia (AML) have internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations
in the FLT3 gene (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, FLT3-ITD), which
cause constitutive activation of the kinase and dysregulated cell
proliferation (1–3). Patients with FLT3-ITD mutations in their
tumors have poor prognoses, emphasizing the importance of
FLT3 in the progression of the disease (1, 3, 4). Although FLT3
has been pursued as a drug target for treating AML, the develop-
ment of FLT3 inhibitors has met with serious challenges. The
major issue has been the development of drug resistance within
only a few months after the initial responses to treatment (5, 6).
Some of the earlier FLT3 inhibitors are nonselective multikinase
inhibitors (7–9). A lack of sufﬁcient target coverage due to dose-
limiting toxicities is thought to be a possible reason for quick
development of drug resistance (7–9). Sorafenib is a more selec-
tive FLT3 inhibitor than some other previous FLT3 inhibitors, yet,
it also led to only transient clinical responses (10, 11). AC220

(quizartinib), the most potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor
reported so far (12, 13), has entered clinical trials (14). Maximal
target coverage could be achieved with doses below the maximally
tolerated dose (14). AC220 demonstrated a high complete remis-
sion rate (54%) in treating FLT3-ITD (þ) AML (14). However, the
median clinical response yet still lasted about only 3 months (14).
More intriguingly, newly acquired secondary mutations at D835
and F691 in the FLT3 kinase domains were found in all of the
relapsed patients (15). These mutations were demonstrated to
confer resistance to AC220 in vitro. It is now clear that FLT3
inhibition alone is unlikely to lead to a durable clinical response
in treating AML due to the genome instability intrinsic to AML
cells and the ease with which they acquire FLT3 resistance muta-
tions (16, 17).

AMG 925 is a novel potent and selective FLT3/CDK4 dual-
kinase inhibitor designed to address the issue of resistance to FLT3
inhibitors (18, 19). CDK4 is a Cyclin D–dependent kinase that
plays an essential role in integrating external growth signals and
promoting progression from G1 to S phase of the mammalian cell
cycle (20, 21). CDK4 functions to phosphorylate and inactivate
the Rb protein. The inactivated Rb then releases E2F transcription
factors to initiate S phase of the cell cycle (22, 23). The role of
the CDK4–Rb pathway in cancer is supported by strong genetic
and pharmacologic evidence (24–27). Rb, the key substrate of
CDK4, and p16, a member of the INK4 family of cellular inhibitor
of CDK4, are both well-deﬁned tumor suppressors (28, 29).
The genes encoding the two tumor-suppressor proteins are
often deleted in various cancers (24). The selective CDK4 inhib-
itor PD0332991 (palbociclib) has recently shown impressive
anticancer efﬁcacy in treating estrogen-dependent advanced

breast cancer in combination with Letrozole, an estrogen synthe-
sis inhibitor (27). Although deletion of the p16 gene is uncom-
mon in AML, epigenetic downregulation of p15, another INK4
family protein, was reported in up to 60% of patients with AML
(30, 31). In AML cell lines carrying FLT3-ITD mutations, expres-
sion of CyclinD2 and D3, two partnering cyclins of CDK4, is
highly upregulated (32). In addition, CDK4 inhibition has been
shown to enhance the apoptotic effects of FLT3 inhibitors in these
AML cell lines (32). These observations suggest that CDK4 is also
an attractive drug target for AML. We hypothesize that the com-
bined inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4 by the dual inhibitor AMG
925 may provide more durable responses than the sole inhibition
of FLT3 by FLT3 inhibitors such as AC220 and sorafenib. In this
study, we demonstrated that AML cell lines did not develop
complete resistance to AMG 925, and the observed partial resis-
tance was not due to FLT3 mutations, in contrast with the case
with FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib and AC220. The mechanism for
the failure to develop full resistance to AMG 925 is suggested by
the failure of FLT3 mutations to appear when AC220 is combined
with the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991. In addition, panels of FLT3
inhibitor resistance mutants were used to test sensitivities to AMG
925, and conﬁrmed that AMG 925 potently inhibited FLT3 D835-
mutant activity. This feature of AMG 925 also likely contributed to
the inability to isolate resistant clones to AMG 925 in AML cell
lines.

Materials and Methods
Compounds

AMG 925 was synthesized at Amgen. PD0332991, AC220, and

sorafenib were purchased from AdooQ BioScience.

Cell lines and proliferation assay

MOLM13 and MV11-4 were obtained from the DSMZ German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Germany).
U937, MDA-MB-436, 293T, and Ba/F3 were obtained from the
ATCC. All cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supple-
mented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. For
Ba/F3 cells, 2 ng/mL of IL3 (R&D Systems) was added to the
medium. All cell lines used in this study were authenticated by
short tandem repeat DNA proﬁling at Genetica DNA Laboratories.
For proliferation assays in 96-well plates, 6,000 cells per well
were seeded and treated the same day with serially diluted
compounds for 3 days. Cell viability was measured using the
CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Dose–response curves were plot-
ted to determine IC50 values for the compounds using GraphPad
Prism v5.01 software (GraphPad Software).

Apoptosis

Apoptosis of the AML cells treated with compounds was
determined by using a Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit following
the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, cells in expo-
nential growth phase were seeded into a 6-well plate at 5  105
cells per well and treated with compounds at indicated concen-
trations for 24 hours. Cells were then stained followed by ﬂow
cytometry analysis. FlowJo software (eBioscience, Inc.) was used
to quantify live, apoptotic, and dead cells in the assay.

Generation of FLT3 inhibitor–resistant AML cell clones

MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells were cultured in medium contain-
ing AMG 925, sorafenib, or AC220. All compounds were used at

0.001 mmol/L initially and the concentration was doubled when
cell viability reached 90%.

To determine the effect of CDK4 inhibition on the occurrence of
resistance to FLT3 inhibitor AC220, MV4-11 cells were cultured in
medium containing AC220, in the presence or absence of CDK4
inhibitor PD0332991. Concentration of PD0332991 was ﬁxed at
0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mmol/L while gradually increasing AC220
from 0.001 mmol/L.

Generation of Ba/F3 clone expressing various human FLT3
mutants

cDNAs carrying the human FLT3 gene with various mutations,
including ITD, ITD/D835Y, ITD/F691I, ITD/Y842N, ITD/N676K,
and D835Y, were cloned into pDONR221 vector (Life Technol-
ogies) by GenScript. FLT3-ITD was generated by inserting 21 bp of
sequences (TTGATTTCAGAGAATATGAAT) into FLT3 coding
sequence region between 1774 and 1775. Variants of FLT3 con-
structs were then shuttled into pRV406G vector by using the
Gateway LR Clonase Enzyme Mix Kit following the manufac-
turer's protocol (Life Technologies). Subsequently, pRV406G
with mutated FLT3 and Ecopackaging plasmids were cotrans-
fected into 293T cells using lipofectamine (Life Technologies) as
per the manufacturer's protocol. Viral supernatants were collected
at 48 hours.

Stable Ba/F3 lines were generated by using retroviral spinfec-
tion with the appropriate mutated plasmids. At 48 hours after
infection, G418 was added to infected cells at a concentration
of 500 mg/mL. Cells were selected in the presence of G418 for
10 days, and subsequently IL3 was washed twice from the cells
with media and cells were allowed to grow in RPMI-1640 and
10% FBS without IL3.

Generation of FLT3 inhibitor–resistant Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cell
clones

Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells were treated with 100 mg/mL mutagen
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU; Sigma) for 16 hours in growth
medium. Cells were then washed three times with medium and
treated with AMG 925 at 0.5 mmol/L or AC220 at 0.05 mmol/L.
Distribute 40,000 cells per well into 4  96-well plates for each
compound. Check cell viability every 2 to 3 days. In about 4 to 6
weeks, transfer and expand surviving cells to 24- and 6-well plates
containing AMG 925 or AC220 of the original concentrations.
Genomic DNA was isolated for FLT3 kinase domain sequencing.
PCR and sequencing primers are the same as used for sequencing
the AML cell clones.

STAT5 phosphorylation

To determine the levels of phospho-STAT5 (P-STAT5), cells
were seeded in a 96-well cell culture plate at a density of 20,000
cells per well. Serially diluted compounds were then added to each
well. Cells were harvested after 1-hour treatment and P-STAT5

(Tyr694) and total STAT5 were determined and quantiﬁed by
using a MSD kit (cat# K11163D; Meso Scale Discovery) following
the manufacturer's protocols. Total protein (10 mg) from each
sample was analyzed.

Western and immunoprecipitation Western blotting

For Western blotting, 25 mg total protein/lane were subjected to
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies
against P-ERK, T-ERK, P-AKT, T-AKT, P-STAT5, T-STAT5, P-RB,
T-RB, and b-actin (all from Cell Signaling Technology). Immu-
noprecipitation Western blotting for T-FLT3 and P-FLT3 was
performed as previously described (18).

Results
CDK4 inhibition enhances apoptosis induced by blocking FLT3
signaling in AML lines bearing FLT3-ITD

The effects of combining the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991
with FLT3 inhibitors sorafeni b and AC220 were evaluated by an
apoptosis assay. MV4-11 and U937 cells were treated with 0.5
mmol/L PD0332991 in combination of with different concen-
trations of sorafenib and AC220. PD0332991 enhanced apo-
ptosis induced by both compounds at a range of concentrations
(Fig. 1, top). Similar results were observed in another AML cell
line MOLM13 (data not shown). No such enhancement was
observed in U937 (Fig. 1, bottom), which carries wild-type
FLT3 and its growth is independent of FLT3. These data dem-
onstrate that CDK4 inhibition could enhance cell killing of an
FLT3 inhibitor when used in combination in AML cells bearing
FLT3-ITD.

Isolation and characterization of AMG 925–resistant AML cell
clones

As previously reported (18, 19), AMG 925 is a potent and
selective dual FLT3/CDK4 inhibitor. It potently inhibits FLT3 and
CDK4 kinases and the growth of FLT3-dependent AML cell lines
bearing FLT3-ITD, MOLM13, and MV4-11 (Supplementary Table
S1). The speciﬁc cellular activities of AMG 925 in blocking FLT3

signaling was demonstrated by inhibition of phosphorylation of
STAT5, a well-validated pharmacodynamics (PD) marker for the
FLT3 pathway (33). Inhibition of CDK4 in cells was demonstrated
þ
by growth inhibition of FLT3-independent and Rb-positive (Rb
)
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1).

AMG 925–resistant AML cell clones MOLM13925R and
MV4-11925R were isolated following protocols as described in
Materials and Methods. The highest concentration of AMG 925 at
which the resistant cells could grow was 0.1 mmol/L after 8 months
of selection. No secondary mutations were found by sequencing
FLT3 cDNA from these clones (our unpublished data).

MOLM13925R and MV4-11925R behaved similarly in growth
inhibition assays. Both were partially resistant to AMG 925 with
growth inhibition IC50 values increased by only 3- to 5-fold
compared with parental MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells. Results
from MV4-11 cells showed in Fig. 2A, left. In addition, cell
doubling time was signiﬁcantly increased, from 48 hours for
parental cells to 72 hours. The resistance phenotype was reversible
and the cells regained full sensitivity to AMG 925 in a week after
compound removal (Fig. 2A, right). Both MOLM13925R and MV4-
11925R clones were similarly cross-resistant to AC220 and sora-
fenib as expected (Supplementary Table S2).

To understand the resistance mechanism, the FLT3 signaling
pathway was studied in the cells resistant to AMG 925. We
compared phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5, ERK, and AKT in
MV4-11 and MV4-11925R cells in the presence of 0.1 mmol/L AMG
925. Although phosphorylation of FLT3 (P-FLT3), STAT5 (P-
STAT5), ERK (P-ERK), and AKT (P-AKT) was inhibited in MV4-
11, 2- to 3-fold increases in P-FLT3, P-ERK, and P-STAT5 were
observed in MV4-11925R cells (Fig. 2B, left). Unlike STAT5, ERK
and AKT, total FLT3 (T-FLT3) in MV4-11925R cells also increased.
No increase in FLT3 mRNA levels was detected by quantitative RT-
PCR (our unpublished data), suggesting a post-transcriptional
mechanism. The MV4-11925R cells were next treated with the
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. After addition of cyclo-
heximide, the cell samples were collected and processed at various
time points to determine levels of T-FLT3 by immunoprecipita-
tion Western blotting (Fig. 2B, right). At 3 hours after the addition

Characterization of AMG 925–resistant AML cells. A, MV4-11925R is partially resistant to AMG 925. MV4-11925R cells were obtained by prolonged incubation of parental
MV4-11 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of AMG 925. Left, MV4-11925R cells were partially resistant to AMG 925 as determined by cell growth
inhibition assays. Right, MV4-11925R cells were partially resistant to AMG 925 and the resistance was reversible as determined by apoptosis assays. Growth inhibition

of cycloheximide, no decrease of T-FLT3 in MV4-11925R was
observed as in MV4-11, suggesting a stabilization of FLT3 in the
MV4-11925R cells.

For comparison with AMG 925, we also isolated sorafenib-
resistant MOLM13SR and MV4-11SR clones following a similar
In contrast with MOLM13925R and MV4-11925R,
protocol.
MOLM13SR and MV4-11SR were obtained within 6 weeks and
readily adapted to growth in 1.0 mmol/L sorafenib. A secondary
FLT3 mutation D835Y was found in all MOLM13SR clones and
D835V in all MV4-11SR clones. Both MOLM13SR and MV4-11SR
were found to be cross-resistant to AC220 as reported (15), but
remained sensitive to AMG 925 (Table 1).

Together, these results indicated that it was harder for the AML
cells to develop strong mutational resistance to the FLT3 and
CDK4 dual inhibitor AMG 925 than to the FLT3 inhibitor
sorafenib.

Isolation of AC220-resistant clones in AML cell lines in the
presence or absence of the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991

To determine whether the inability to isolate strong muta-
tional resistance to AMG 925 was at least partially due to its

CDK4-inhibiting activity, we compared the ability of MV4-11
cells to develop resistance to AC220, a more recently developed
FLT3 inhibitor that is also more potent and selective than
sorafenib,
in the presence or absence of CDK4 inhibitor
PD0332991. The concentration of PD0332991 was ﬁxed at
0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mmol/L whereas AC220 gradually
increased from 0.001 to >0.1 mmol/L. Ten independent isola-
tions were performed for each treatment. Within 6 weeks, ﬁve
clones were obtained from the treatment of AC220 alone, two
F691L, one D835V, and two N841K, as identiﬁed by sequenc-
ing the cDNA of FLT3 kinase domains. For AC220 þ
PD0332991 treatments, three clones (two D835V and one
N841K) were obtained at 0.001 mmol/L PD0332991; one clone
(N841K) at 0.01 mmol/L PD0332991; no resistant clones were
obtained for 0.1 and 1 mmol/L. The number of resistant clones
resulted from different combinations appeared to indicate a
dose effect of PD0332991 on the frequency of resistant clones
isolated. Proliferation, apoptosis, and PD marker P-STAT5
assays demonstrated a general correlation of these phenotypes
characteristic of FLT3 inhibition (Table 1). Despite the small
numbers of resistant clones obtained, this result is in support of

Induction of apoptosis by AMG 925 in FLT3 inhibitor–resistant AML cells.
MV4-11, MV4-11 FLT3-ITD/D835V, MV4-11 FLT3-ITD/N841K, and MV4-11 FLT3-
ITD/F691L cells were treated with AMG 925, sorafenib, and AC220 at
concentrations as indicated. Cell samples were collected 24 hours after
addition of compounds and analyzed for apoptosis by Annexin V/Sytox
Green staining and ﬂow cytometry.

All the resistant AML cell clones isolated by AC220 and sor-
afenib were assayed for cross-resistance by proliferation, P-STAT5,
and apoptosis assays, and the results summarized in Table 1
and Fig. 3. AMG 925 potently inhibited D835Y/V, but signiﬁ-
cantly less so on F691L, consistent with our structural analysis of
AMG 925 as a type 1 kinase inhibitor (19).

Proﬁling of AMG 925 against a panel of FLT3 mutations in
Ba/F3 cells

Ba/F3 is a murine lymphoid cell line dependent on IL3 for
survival and proliferation. We generated Ba/F3 cell clones stably
expressing human FLT3 with ITD mutation in combination with a
set of well-known FLT3 mutations (D835Y, F691I, Y842N, and
N676K; refs. 15, 34, 35), and tested them for sensitivity to AMG
925 (Table 2). By growth inhibition assay, Ba/F3 clones expressing
FLT3-ITD/D835Y, FLT3-ITD/Y842N, FLT3-ITD/N676K,
and
FLT3-D835Y were similarly sensitive to AMG 925 as the Ba/F3
cells expressing FLT3-ITD alone. All of these mutants were resis-
tant to AC220 and sorafenib to various degrees. The data from Ba/
F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD/D835Y are supportive of our earlier
results that AMG 925 inhibited FLT3-ITD/D835Y/V human AML
cells that are resistant to sorafenib and AC220 (18). Although Ba/
F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD/F691I showed some resistance to
AMG 925, it was worth noting that the resistance to AMG 925 was
to a smaller degree compared with that of AC220 and sorafenib.
The increase in IC50 values by proliferation assays in the FLT3-
ITD/F691I cells compared with the FLT3-ITD cells was 10-, 163-,
and 69-fold for AMG 925, AC220, and sorafenib, respectively. The
growth inhibition by AMG 925, AC220, and sorafenib correlated
well with inhibition of P-STAT5 in the cells, indicating that the
growth inhibition by the compounds is largely mediated through
FLT3.

Isolation of AMG 925–resistant clones in Ba/F3 cells

For superior clonal growth and tolerance of adverse growth
conditions compared with human AML cell lines, the Ba/F3 FLT3-
ITD cells described as above were used for isolation of resistance
mutations to AMG 925. AC220-resistant FLT3 mutations were
also isolated for comparison. Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells were treated
with mutagen ENU as described previously (36) and plated in 4 
96-well plates in medium containing AC220 or AMG 925. Selec-
tion with 0.05 mmol/L AC220 led to 29 clones (7.6%, Table 3)
with various nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes at
F691, D835, Y842, and N841 in the FLT3 kinase domains. In

contrast, only four AMG 925–resistant clones (1%) were obtained
at 0.5 mmol/L AMG 925, all were F691L mutation, two with codon
TTT changed to TTA and two to TTG. Selection with higher
concentrations of AMG 925 did not lead to resistant clones.
Proliferation and P-STAT5 assays conﬁrmed a correlation of
resistance with lack of FLT3 inhibition (Supplementary Table
S3). This result indicated that under certain conditions, F691
mutations may be isolated by AMG 925, consistent with AMG 925
being a type 1 kinase inhibitor.

Discussion

AMG 925 is an FLT3/CDK4 dual inhibitor recently developed
to overcome the resistance issue of selective FLT3 inhibitors by
combining FLT3- and CDK4-inhibiting activities in one molecule
(18, 19). CDK4 has long been pursued as a genetically validated
þ
cancer drug target for a broad spectrum of Rb
cancers, including
AML (24, 25, 37). PD0332991 is the ﬁrst selective CDK4 inhibitor
to reach clinical trials (27). A phase II study showed that, in
combination with Letrozole (estrogen synthesis inhibitor),
PD0332991 prolonged progression-free survival by 18 months
in advanced breast cancer patients, providing the ﬁrst clinical
validation of CDK4 as a cancer drug target (27). As a monother-
apy, selective CDK4 inhibitors may also encounter resistance
issues because CDK4 inhibition is cytostatic and may be relatively
easily compensated or bypassed (38, 39). A dual FLT3/CDK4
inhibitor like AMG 925 could have several advantages over FLT3-
or CDK4-selective inhibitors alone in treating AML. First, AMG
925 is more efﬁcacious than a CDK4 inhibitor in killing FLT3-ITD
AML cells by its FLT3 inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we have
conﬁrmed that CDK4 inhibition can enhance the apoptotic effect
of an FLT3 inhibitor in FLT3-dependent AML cells with FLT3-ITD.
þ
Second, AMG 925 inhibits proliferation of Rb
AML cells with
wild-type FLT3. The clinical response in treating AML would be
less dependent on ITD allelic burden (10). Third and more
importantly, by targeting two kinases whose functions are not
fully overlapping but both crucial for AML cell growth, AMG 925
may reduce the chances of FLT3 resistance mutations and lead to
more durable clinical responses than FLT3 inhibitors alone. It is
tempting to draw an analogy here between FLT3-dependent AML

and estrogen-dependent breast cancer. The growth factor depen-
dence in both cases could reﬂect the relative integrity of growth
regulation pathways in the cancer cells (e.g., relatively low apo-
ptotic potential and high dependence on CDK4). This is thought
to be important for the maximal antiproliferation efﬁcacy of a
CDK4 inhibitor, and preventing the development of resistance to
inhibitors of growth factor signaling. In clinical studies, CDK4
inhibitor PD0332991 appeared better tolerated than standard
care of chemotherapy. Therefore, compared with the combination
of FLT3 inhibitors with chemotherapies (40, 41), AMG 925,
which combines FLT3 with CDK4-inhibiting activities, may show
a better clinical toxicity proﬁle and would be a preferable treat-
ment for older patients with AML (27).

To demonstrate that AMG 925 may prevent FLT3 inhibitor
resistance mutations, we attempted to isolate AMG 925–resistant
clones in the AML cell lines MOLM13 and MV4-11. We found that
the development of resistance to AMG 925 was rather different
from that of the type 2 FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib and AC220. The
FLT3 inhibitor–resistant clones could be fairly readily isolated
within 6 weeks. The resistance was strong with IC50 values
increased over 100- to 200-fold in cell proliferation assays com-
pared with those in the parental cells. In contrast, it took 8 months
of selection for establishment of clones that were only partially
resistant to AMG 925, with IC50 values increased by only 3- to 5-
fold compared with those of the parental cells. The AMG 925–
resistant clones grew slower with a doubling time of 72 versus 48
hours for the parental cells. The resistance to AMG 925 was
reversible and no secondary resistance mutations were identiﬁed
in FLT3, indicating an epigenetic responses to the drug treatment.
An increase in total FLT3 was found in the AMG 925–resistant AML
cells and believed to be the major mechanism of the resistance. The
similar characteristics of all of the AMG 925–resistant clones from
two AML cell lines may indicate that this may represent the primary
resistance mechanism to the treatment conditions tested. We also
tried several rounds of selection for AMG 925–resistant clones,
starting with concentrations of AMG 925 higher than 0.001 mmol/
L. No resistant clones were able to grow out. Together, these results
are supportive of the hypothesis that simultaneously inhibiting
FLT3 and CDK4 in AML cells may inhibit development of drug
resistance as occurs with FLT3 inhibitors alone.

AMG 925 Overcomes FLT3 Inhibitor Resistance

To support the hypothesis that the CDK4-inhibiting activity
of AMG 925 accounted for our inability to isolate mutations
resistant to the compound, we tried to isolate resistant muta-
tions to the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 in the presence or absence of
the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991. With AC220 alone, we were
able to isolate ﬁve AC220-resistant clones with one having
mutation D835V, two F691L, and two N841K. With AC220
combined with PD0332991, four mutations were obtained,
three (two D835V and one N841K) with 0.001 mmol/L
PD0332991, and one (N841K) with 0.01 mmol/L PD0332991.
No resistant clones grew out when PD0332991 was increased to
0.1 mmol/L or higher. These results indicated that sufﬁciently
high concentrations of PD0332991 will prevent FLT3 inhibi-
tor–resistant mutations from occurring in a dose-dependent
manner. The cell growth inhibition IC50 value of PD0332991 in
MV4-11 cells was 0.092 mmol/L. Therefore, it appeared that a
concentration of PD0332991 around its IC50 value would be
needed to signiﬁcantly reduce resistant mutations. Only D835
mutations were also isolated with sorafenib in our earlier
attempt. F691L and N841K were additional ones obtained
with AC220. The reason for the difference could be due to a
difference in potency and selectivity of the compounds, but
could also be due to the difﬁculty in achieving closely similar
conditions for isolation process with AML cells.

Another feature of AMG 925 that might also contribute to the
inability to isolate resistant mutations in FLT3 is that the com-
pound inhibits FLT3-ITD/D835 mutants. D835 represents one of
the two hot spot mutations in FLT3 that confer resistance to
AC220 and sorafenib (15, 42). Structural analyses of the binding
of AMG 925, sorafenib, and AC220 to FLT3 suggest that AMG 925
is a type 1 kinase inhibitor whereas sorafenib and AC220 are
type 2 inhibitors (15, 19). D835 was shown to be critical in
interaction with sorafenib and AC200 but not for AMG 925. These
analyses explain and validate our observations of the cellular
activity differences in inhibiting various FLT3 mutants by these
compounds.

FLT3 mutants with amino acid changes at the F691 gatekeeper
residue were expected to affect binding to both type 1 and 2 FLT3
inhibitors. We were able to isolate F691 mutation (F691L) with
AC220 but not with AMG 925 in AML cell lines. As shown in
Table 1, the AC220-resistant MV4-11–bearing FLT3-ITD/F691L
was indeed about 5- and >10-fold more resistant to AMG 925 than
the parental MV4-11 by proliferation assays and P-STAT5 assays,
respectively. Our inability to isolate F691 mutations in MV4-11
with AMG 925 was thought primarily due to the CDK4-inhibiting
activity of the compound. Another possibility could be that the
AML cell lines adapted to growth at lower concentrations of AMG
925 relatively easily through increasing expression of the FLT3
protein. It is conceivable that more variations in isolation proto-
cols might have resulted in the isolation of F691 mutations with
AMG 925 in AML cell lines.

The Ba/F3 cell line is known to be easier to work with for the
isolation of mutations resistant to kinase inhibitors (43). There-
fore, we also tried to isolate AMG 925–resistant clones using this
cell line with AC220 as a reference. It is worth noting that these
mouse cells are generally 5- to 10-fold less sensitive to CDK4
inhibitors compared with human cells (our unpublished data;
ref. 44). For this reason, it was thought that it would be easier to
isolate mutations at gate keeper residue F691 with AMG 925 in
this mouse system. We obtained numerous resistant mutations to
AC220, including the two hot spot mutations at D835 and F691

(Table 3), which demonstrates that the isolation protocol worked
well. As expected, we were able to isolate 4 AMG 925–resistant
clones, all having mutation F691L. Although the number of AMG
925–resistant mutations is small for a ﬁrm conclusion, this result
is consistent with AMG 925 being a type 1 kinase inhibitor. The
clinical implication would be that mutations at F691 might arise
during the treatment of AMG 925 when CDK4 target coverage
would be signiﬁcantly compromised for various reasons (45). It is
worth mentioning that the resistance to AMG 925 conferred by
F691L was relatively weak compared with resistance to AC220 and
sorafenib, implying that such mutations might not as easily occur
in AMG 925 treatment.

 

Although we believe that the CDK4 activity of AMG 925 and its
type 1 kinase inhibitor characteristics are primarily responsible for
the lack of isolation of FLT3 mutations in AML cells, we could not
rule out the possibility of some role by other activities associated
with AMG 925. However, the proliferation IC50 value of AMG 925
 
cells, including MDA-MB-436, is in the mmol/L range. Rb
in Rb
solid tumor cells are independent of the FLT3 and CDK4 path-
ways. The high IC50 value in these cells indicates a fairly low
nonspeciﬁc cellular activity of AMG 925. In addition, the success-
ful isolation of F691L mutations in the Ba/F3 system also indi-
cated that it was unlikely that nonspeciﬁc activities of AMG 925
were playing a major role in the inability to isolate AMG 925–
resistant cells in AML cells. It is possible that the inability of AMG
925–resistant cells to grow at higher concentrations of AMG 925
may be partially due to the nonspeciﬁc activities of
the
compound.

In summary, mutational resistance has been a serious clinical
issue for FLT3 inhibitors. Resistance to AMG 925, a dual FLT3/
CDK4 inhibitor, appears harder to develop in AML cell lines
than that to the FLT3 inhibitors. The results of the treatment of
the AML cell line MV4-11 with a combination of AC220 and
PD0332991 support the hypothesis that the CDK4-inhibiting
activity of AMG 925 played a signiﬁcant role in reducing the
appearance of FLT3 resistance mutations. In addition, AMG
925 as a type 1 kinase inhibitor, potently inhibited FLT3-ITD/
D835, one of the major resistance mutations acquired during
AC220 treatment. We believe that AMG 925 has the potential to
overcome drug resistance associated with FLT3 inhibitors and
could lead to more durable clinical responses in patients with
AML. Clinical trials in patients with AML are currently being
planned.
