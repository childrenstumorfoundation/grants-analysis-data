The autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a hereditary tumor syndrome caused by inactivation of 
the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, encoding merlin. Apart from tumors affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems, 
most NF2 patients develop peripheral neuropathies. This peripheral nerve disease can occur in the absence of nerve-damaging 
tumors, suggesting an etiology that is independent of gross tumor burden. We discovered that merlin isoform 2 (merlin-iso2) has 
a specific function in maintaining axonal integrity and propose that reduced axonal NF2 gene dosage leads to NF2-associated 
polyneuropathy. We identified a merlin-iso2–dependent complex that promotes activation of the GTPase RhoA, enabling 
downstream Rho-associated kinase to promote neurofilament heavy chain phosphorylation. Merlin-iso2–deficient mice exhibited 
impaired locomotor capacities, delayed sensory reactions and electrophysiological signs of axonal neuropathy. Sciatic nerves 
from these mice and sural nerve biopsies from NF2 patients revealed reduced phosphorylation of the neurofilament H subunit, 
decreased interfilament spacings and irregularly shaped axons.

Neurons of both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central 
nervous system (CNS) are highly polarized complex cellular units. 
During development, several morphological steps are required for 
normal functioning and plasticity of the developing nervous system. 
New neurons migrate to their appropriate locations, extend axons 
and dendrites into the correct target regions, and form synapses with 
their partners. These distinct morphological processes depend on 
the spatiotemporal control of intrinsic neuronal signaling networks 
in which the Rho family of small GTPases are important regulatory 
components1. The signaling mechanisms that establish these highly 
plastic neuronal processes are well characterized, but the manner in 
which these neurons achieve and maintain more stable structures, 
such as axon radial growth over far-reaching distances, throughout 
life is less well understood.

Neurofilaments are at least one component known to be required 
to promote and maintain radial growth also known as axonal cal-
iber2.  Neurofilaments  are  neuron-specific  intermediate  filaments 
composed of NF-H (200 kDa), NF-M (150 kDa) and NF-L (68 kDa) 
subunits. To date, transcriptional upregulation3 and/or extensive side-
arm phosphorylation of the NF-M or NF-H subunits4 are thought 
to determine structural integrity in axons2, whereas the upstream 
signaling mechanisms that control and modify neurofilaments are 

not well characterized. Nefl (which encodes NF-L) gene disruption 
in mice results in loss of neurofilaments and subsequent failure of 
axons to grow radially5. Neurofilament abnormalities in humans have 
been documented in a number of neurological diseases, including 
several inherited neuropathies2. Inherited genetic mutations related to 
neurofilaments induce axonal alterations that result in nerve damage, 
leading to typical neuropathic symptoms, such as loss of sensation, 
pain or muscular weakness6.

NF2 is a hereditary tumor syndrome caused by inactivation of the 
NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoding merlin. Apart from gliogenic 
tumors in the PNS and CNS, most NF2 patients develop peripheral 
neuropathies7,8. NF2-related neuropathy mostly appears in a sym-
metric and distal manner and occurs in the absence of compressive 
spinal or peripheral tumors8, indicating a systemic, rather than focal, 
etiology. This suggests the involvement of factors other than gross 
tumor burden.

We identified a function for merlin in neurons of the developing 
CNS9. At least two alternatively spliced merlin variants are expressed: 
merlin isoform 1 (merlin-iso1), which lacks exon 16, and merlin-iso2, 
which contains exon 16 and encodes a C-terminally truncated pro-
tein. Merlin-iso1 has been established as a tumor suppressor, but little 
is known about merlin-iso2’s function. We found that both merlin

phosphorylation and axonal radial growth. (a,b) Merlin-iso1 (a) and

day 15. Merlin-iso2 was expressed in Purkinje cell axons (Ax arrow). 
Arrowheads indicate Purkinje cell somata. Molecular layer (ML) is mainly 
composed of Purkinje cell dendrites. Scale bars represent 75 µm and 
15 µm (magnified images). White boxes indicate areas shown at higher 
magnification. We quantified merlin-iso2 expression in Purkinje cell axons 
during postnatal development (P3–15) and in adults (P3, 0%; P5, 0%;  
P9, 5.15%; P15, 45.53%; adult, 96.92%; n = 50 axons from 2 mice 
for each investigated age). (c,d) Merlin isoform–specific immunolabeling 
(green) in primary DRG neurons. Co-staining with phosphorylated 
neurofilaments (pNF-H, red) indicates expression in axons. Merlin-iso1 
was present in axonal growth cones (arrows) and merlin-iso2 was detected 
along the whole axon. Scale bars represent 20 µm. (e,f) Quantification

mean + s.e.m.; n.s., not significant, P = 0.07). Immunoblots for actin 
(loading control), merlin-iso1 and merlin-iso2 or merlin were used to 
confirm knockdown and overexpression. Merlin overexpression migrated  
as a doublet; the upper band representing phosphorylated merlin and the  
lower band represented dephosphorylated merlin. For full-length blots  
and quantitations, see Supplementary Figure 3.

 isoforms were able to restrict dendritic morphogenesis through inhi-
bition of the small GTPase Rac1 (ref. 9). Our finding suggest that 
merlin, a known tumor suppressor, is involved in controlling highly 
plastic neuronal processes such as dendrites in the developing brain. 
We hypothesize that merlin may also function in the development and 
maintenance of more stable structures such as axons, and suggest that 
the specific loss or reduction of merlin in neurons may contribute to 
NF2-related polyneuropathy.

RESULTS
Merlin-iso2 mediates neurofilament phosphorylation 
Using isoform-specific antibodies, we detected both merlin isoforms 
in cerebellar Purkinje cell somata (Fig. 1a,b) and dendrites in the 
molecular layer. Only isoform 2 was localized to axonal processes run-
ning from Purkinje cells toward the white cerebellar matter (Fig. 1a,b 
and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Merlin-iso2–positive  signals  in  Purkinje  cells  began  to  appear 
between postnatal days 9 and 15 (P9 and P15) in Purkinje cell axons 
(Fig. 1 and Online Methods), coinciding with a period of Purkinje cell 
axonal maturation characterized by extensive neurofilament phos-
phorylation  and  diameter  adjustment10.  In  addition,  we  detected 
predominant merlin-iso2 expression in cells belonging to the PNS, 
including sciatic nerve axons (Supplementary Fig. 2) and axons of 
primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells (Fig. 1c,d).

We  used  primary  neuronal  monocultures  independent  of  the 
associated influence of glial cells and the murine embryonic carci-
noma P19 cell line, which are known to differentiate into neuronal 
cells11, to investigate whether merlin-iso2 affects axon–intrinsic 
morphogenesis.  Specific  knockdown  of  merlin-iso2  or  of  both 
isoforms in isolated primary cerebellar neurons decreased axonal 
diameter, whereas merlin-iso1–specific knockdown had no detect-
able influence (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Concordantly, 
overexpression  of  merlin-iso2  elicited  a  substantial  increase  
in axonal diameter compared with overexpression of merlin-iso1

(Fig. 1f). The decrease in axonal diameter resulting from merlin-
so2 protein reduction could be rescued by the expression of human 
merlin-iso2 in mouse P19 cells (Fig. 2).

We investigated whether the merlin-iso2 effect on axonal caliber 
is mediated through neurofilament regulation. Although the total 
amount of neurofilaments remained unaffected (data not shown), the 
phosphorylation status of NF-H in primary cerebellar neurons was 
decreased by merlin-iso2 knockdown, but merlin-iso1 knockdown 
(Fig. 2a). Accordingly, merlin-iso2 overexpression led to a robust 
neurofilament  phosphorylation  in  P19  cells,  whereas  merlin-iso1 
overexpression had only minor effects (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these 
findings establish a specific intrinsic neuronal role of merlin-iso2 in 
the regulation of neurofilament phosphorylation that leads to radial 
axonal growth.

Axonal merlin-iso2 involves RhoA signaling 
Neurofilaments  are  phosphorylated  by  several  serine/threonine 
kinases2. Because merlin lacks any endogenous kinase activity, we 
screened for serine/threonine kinases that were involved in mer-
lin and/or neurofilament signaling (Supplementary Table 1). We 
monitored whether the knockdown of each tested kinase could pre-
vent or decrease neurofilament phosphorylation following merlin-
iso2 overexpression in vitro. One of the kinases that we identified,  
Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), has been reported to directly phos-
phorylate neurofilaments in vitro12. Overexpression of merlin-iso2

and simultaneous silencing of ROCK using siRNA prevented mer-
lin-iso2–specific NF-H phosphorylation (Fig. 2d), suggesting that 
merlin-iso2 acts upstream of ROCK.

To elucidate how merlin-iso2 regulates ROCK, we examined the 
activity of the GTPase RhoA, an upstream regulator of ROCK. Merlin-
iso2, but not merlin-iso1, overexpression activated RhoA in P19 cells 
(Fig. 2e). In primary neurons, merlin-iso2 overexpression was mim-
icked by the application of a Rho activator (CN01), as indicated by 
increased RhoA activity, NF-H phosphorylation and an increase in 
axonal caliber (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, application of the same Rho 
activator alone could rescue the axonal caliber decrease following 
merlin-iso2 repression in P19 cells (Fig. 2c).

In addition to the CNS, we found that merlin-iso2 function is 
important  in  PNS  neurons.  We  isolated  glia-free  primary  DRG 
cells whose axons (known as afferents) relay sensory information 
into  the  CNS.  A  merlin-iso2–specific  knockdown  in  these  cells 
resulted in a decrease in neurofilament phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). 
We also examined the effect of merlin loss using genetically engi-
neered mice bearing complete isoform-specific knockouts of merlin,  
designated  Nf2-iso1−/−  and  Nf2-iso2−/−.  We  confirmed  merlin 
 isoform–specific knockout at the protein level in forebrain and hind-
brain lysates (Supplementary Fig. 4c). As expected, neurofilament 
phosphorylation was predominantly reduced in Nf2-iso2−/− brains 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Similar to CNS nerve cells, in vitro DRG 
neurons isolated from Nf2-iso2−/− mice had smaller axonal diameters 
than wild-type control and Nf2-iso1−/− mice (Fig. 3b). Moreover,  
Nf2-iso2−/− DRG neurons could be rescued by expression of merlin-iso2,  
with a substantial RhoA activation accompanied by neurofilament 
phosphorylation and subsequent radial axonal growth (Fig. 3c and 
Supplementary Fig. 4d). Transfection of a constitutively active form 
of RhoA (RhoA 63L) into DRG cells13 resulted in an increase in  
neurofilament phosphorylation and axonal caliber growth (Fig. 3d).

These data indicate that RhoA activity contributes to axonal diam-
eter adjustment in both the CNS and PNS. Our data imply that part of 
 merlin-iso2’s mechanism of action involves activation of RhoA, enabling 
downstream ROCK to promote neurofilament phosphorylation.

Merlin assembles a multi–protein complex 
Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating 
proteins (GAPs) and GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) are con-
sidered to be the primary determinants in neuronal Rho regulation. 
Our data indicate that merlin is involved in controlling Rho activity, 
specifically axonal caliber growth in neurons in vitro. We therefore 
explored how merlin-iso2 might operate in the axon to promote 
Rho signaling.

Because  merlin  has  been  suggested  to  interact  with  the  gua-
nine  nucleotide  dissociation  inhibitor  RhoGDI14,  as  well  as  with 
p190RhoGAP  (unpublished  observations),  in  other  cell  types,  we 
hypothesized  the  existence  of  a  neurofilament-associated  multi- 
protein  complex  in  which  merlin-iso2  regulates  RhoA  activity  in 
neurons. Both RhoGDI and p190RhoGAP were expressed in DRG 
cell axons (Supplementary Fig. 4f and 5a). The reduction of either 
RhoGDI or p190RhoGAP in neuronal cells led to an increase in Rho 
activity,  neurofilament  phosphorylation  and  radial  axonal  growth 
(Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5c,d), establishing the importance 
of these regulatory components per se in axonal Rho activity control.
In wild-type mouse sciatic nerves, the levels of the two major merlin  
isoforms, RhoA and RhoGDI remained unchanged during develop-
ment (Supplementary Fig. 5e–g). The level of p190RhoGAP appeared 
to be higher at birth (P0) and was reduced around P20, coinciding 
with axonal maturation characterized by extensive neurofilament 
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 5g).

Notably,  the  sciatic  nerves  of  adult  Nf2-iso2−/−  mice  (P60) 
showed  reduced  levels  of  active  RhoA  (RhoA-GTP)  and  reduced

phosphorylated neurofilaments (Fig. 3f). However, the total protein 
amounts of p190RhoGAP, RhoA and RhoGDI remained unchanged, 
indicating  that  the  reduction  of  merlin-iso2  has  no  effect  on  the 
expression and/or stability of these components in adult mice.

Using  immunoprecipitation,  we  confirmed  the  existence  of  a 
multi-protein complex and examined its composition. Antibodies 
to  RhoGDI  co-precipitated  both  merlin  isoforms,  as  well  as 
p190RhoGAP from primary granule cell lysates (Fig. 3g). Antibodies 
to merlin–iso2 and merlin–iso1 both co-precipitated p190RhoGAP 
from sciatic nerve lysates (Fig. 3h). The fact that merlin-iso2 dif-
fers from merlin-iso1 in the C terminus, a precise function distinct 
from the C-terminal merlin-iso1 is suggested. We tested whether 
a  C-terminal  fragment  of  merlin-iso2  was  sufficient  to  associate 
with neurofilaments. Indeed, only the C-terminal merlin-iso2 co- 
immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated neurofilaments (Fig. 3i 
and  Supplementary  Fig.  6),  indicating  that,  although  both  full-
length isoforms can form a complex with RhoGDI and p190RhoGAP,  
merlin-iso2 likely acts locally in axons.

We examined the interaction between merlin and RhoGDI in vitro 
(Supplementary Fig. 7). No interaction was detected in vitro using 
purified  merlin  full-length  proteins  (Supplementary  Fig.  7a,b).  
An  interaction  could  only  be  shown  with  the  FERM  domain  of  
merlin (N terminus, shared by the two isoforms) using both purified 
GST- and His-tagged RhoGDI. We next tested whether merlin acts 
as a RhoGDI displacement factor (that is, releases inactive RhoA-
GDP from RhoGDI to result in RhoA activation). In an in vitro Rho 

activity assay15, addition of a Rho GEF induced a rapid nucleotide 
exchange. Addition of RhoGDI sufficiently inhibited this exchange 
by maintaining RhoA in its inactive form. Inclusion of N-terminal 
merlin (FERM domain) did not affect the intrinsic RhoA GTP loading 
or the activity of Rho GEF toward RhoA (Supplementary Fig. 7c) and 
was unable to induce release of RhoGDI from RhoA (Supplementary 
Fig. 7c). Taken together, at least in this in vitro assay, we could not 
detect merlin-dependent inhibition of RhoGDI. Other partners might 
be required for a complete merlin-dependent RhoGDI displacement 
from RhoA in vivo. In addition, in vivo full-length merlin has distinct 
molecular conformations16 that may be required to bind and control 
RhoGDI activity coordinating RhoA signal activation.

Analysis of merlin isoform–specific knockout mice
The availability of isoform-specific Nf2 knockout mice enabled us 
to test merlin-iso2–specific functions in an intact nervous system 
and to determine whether merlin-iso2 loss contributes to an axonal 
pathogenesis  of  NF2-associated  polyneuropathy.  On  the  basis  of 
our in vitro data, we expected these mice to display axonal structure 
alterations resulting from irregular neurofilament phosphorylation. 
Because aberrant axonal signals can induce secondary Schwann cell 
changes in older mice17, we studied young mice (2 months old), which 
allowed us to concentrate on specific axonal changes. Our initial  
studies revealed that both mouse lines appeared to be devoid of NF2- 
typical tumors, suggesting a compensatory potential for the two major 
merlin isoforms (unpublished data).

Figure 4  Axon structure abnormalities in Nf2-iso2−/− mice. (a) Electron 
micrographs of sciatic nerve axons from Nf2-iso2−/− mice compared  
with Nf2-iso2+/+ mice. Arrow indicates densely packed neurofilaments 
and mitochondria. Scale bars represent 1 µm. (b) More dysmorphic 
sciatic nerve axons were found in Nf2-iso2+/− and Nf2-iso2−/− than in 
Nf2-iso2+/+ mice (**P < 0.01, t = –3.401, df = 29; ***P < 0.001,  
t = –5.578, df = 34; n = 542 axons from 3 mice, mean + s.e.m.).  
(c) The mean solidity factor was decreased in myelinated axons in sciatic 
nerve cross sections from Nf2-iso2+/− and Nf2-iso2−/− mice compared 
with Nf2-iso2+/+ mice, whereas loss of merlin-iso1 (Nf2-iso1−/−,  
Nf2-iso1+/− and Nf2-iso1+/+ mice) had no significant effect (*P < 0.05,  
t = –5.196, df = 165; **P < 0.01, t = –7.135, df = 183; ***P < 0.001, 
t = –5.871, df = 169; n.s., not significant; n = 1,488 axons from 3 mice, 
mean + s.e.m.). Axons were categorized according to their diameter  
(x axis represents axon calibers in µm). (d) Sciatic nerve axons of 
young P7 Nf2-iso2+/− and Nf2-iso2−/− mice showed comparable solidity 
factors (*P < 0.05, t = –5.677, df = 1,039, n = 1,512 axons from 3 
mice, mean + s.e.m.). (e) Gastrocnemius muscle fibers of Nf2-iso2+/+ 
and Nf2-iso2−/− mice were stained with silver impregnation (top) and 
immunohistochemically for acetylcholine receptor and myelinated nerve 
fibers (bottom). Muscle fibers are equal in size, without signs of dying 
muscle cells or accumulation of fat cells or connective tissue. Muscle 
fibers appear straight and not wrinkled and the cell bodies (arrows) are 
arranged along the border of the muscle fiber, not centrally. We detected 
equal amounts of myelinated nerve fibers by NF-H staining and  
normal amounts and sizes of endplates by bungarotoxin (BTX) staining  
(n = 2 mice per genotype). Scale bars represent 100 µm.

Sciatic  nerve  axons  of  Nf2-iso2−/−  mice  exhibited  morphologi-
cal  abnormalities,  such  as  misshaped  and  dysmorphic  axons  and 
accumulations of densely packed neurofilaments and mitochondria 
(Fig. 4a,b). Axonal shrinkage resulting from an irregular bending of 
the axonal surface led to a strong reduction in the solidity factor in 
both heterozygous (Nf2-iso2+/−) and homozygous (Nf2-iso2−/−) mice 
(Fig. 4c). Loss of merlin-iso1 had no effect on the roundness of axons. 
Even young merlin-iso2–deficient mice (P7) displayed a significant 
reduction in the solidity factor (P < 0.05; Fig. 4d), indicating that the 
observed phenotype originates in the early period of axonal structure 
maintenance. This abnormal phenotype, including axonal atrophy 
with shrunken and collapsed axons of peripheral nerves, resembles 
that described in mice with a neurofilament mutation18. Although 
we detected a high number of shrunken axons in Nf2-iso2−/− mice,

mice (***P < 0.001, t = –4.557, df = 39; n.s., not significant,  
t = 0.007, df = 15; n = 8 mice per group, mean + s.e.m.). (b) Rotarod

(c) Nerve conduction velocities (n = 6 mice per group; n.s., not

muscle action potential amplitudes recorded after proximal and distal

compared with Nf2-iso2−/−, Nf2-iso2+/+ and Nf2-iso1+/+ mice (*P < 0.05,  
t = 6.912, df = 12, t = 7.280, df = 10; ***P < 0.001; n.s., not

such as spheroid formations or amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
accumulations, along axons (Supplementary Fig. 8b). As no classi-
cal signs of axonal degeneration were detected, we propose that the 
number of normal functional axons was decreased. However, because 
axonal integrity is thought to be essential for myelin maintenance, 
it is possible that an active neurodegeneration may occur in older 
Nf2-iso2−/− mice. Axonal targeting also appeared to be normal in 
merlin isoform–specific knockout mice, despite the morphological 
axonal alterations. Silver impregnation and immunohistochemical 
staining for acetylcholine receptors and myelinated nerve fibers of 
gastrocnemius muscles did not show relevant alterations concerning 
muscular structure or nerve targeting (Fig. 4e), indicating proper 
muscle innervation in Nf2-iso2−/− mice.

Given that phosphorylation events equate to addition of repulsive 
negative charges, neurofilament phosphorylation results in a larger 
distance  between  single  neurofilament  molecules4.  Accordingly, 
axons  of  both  heterozygous  and  homozygous  Nf2-iso2−/−  mice 
showed  decreased  interfilament  distances  as  a  result  of  reduced 
neurofilament phosphorylation (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, Nf2-iso1−/− 
axons showed only a slight reduction in interfilament spacing. Again, 
comparable effects of merlin-iso2 loss could be detected in young 
mice at P7 (Fig. 5c).

As merlin has important tumor suppressive functions in Schwann 
cells  of  the  PNS19,  axonal  structure  and  shape  alterations  in  
Nf2-iso2−/− mice could be indirectly determined by modified Schwann 
cell signals. In an established NF2 mouse model in which both merlin  
isoforms  are  conditionally  deleted  in  Schwann  cells  (Mpz-cre;  
Nf2loxP/loxP  mice)20,  neurofilament  phosphorylation  was  slightly 
increased,  as  was  the  distance  between  single  neurofilaments  
(Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 8c). These findings indicate that the 
described axonal changes in Nf2-iso2−/− sciatic nerves are of axonal 
origin and are not a product of merlin loss in Schwann cells.

We next tested whether the described morphological alterations 
are causative for neuropathic symptoms in vivo. Hot plate testing 
 measuring  pain  sensitivity  revealed  that  both  heterozygous  and 
homozygous  Nf2-iso2−/−  mice  had  prolonged  withdrawal  laten-
cies  to  thermal  stimuli  compared  with  wild-type  littermates  and  
Nf2-iso1−/−  mice  (Fig.  6a),  indicating  thermal  hypoalgesia  and 
impaired  responses  to  noxious  thermal  stimuli.  Rotarod  test-
ing revealed that Nf2-iso2−/− mice also displayed deficits in motor 
function. After 5 d of training, they had a mean latency to fall of 
115 s compared with 217 s for wild-type littermates (Fig. 6b). Even  
Nf2-iso2+/− mice showed a relevant phenotype (155 s).

Electrophysiological  measurements  on  sciatic  nerves  in  vivo 
revealed  similar  nerve  conduction  velocities  (mainly  determined 
by myelination and reduced in demyelinating neuropathies) in Nf2-
iso1−/− and Nf2-iso2−/− mice (Fig. 6c). In contrast, compound mus-
cle action potential amplitudes (reflecting axonal functionality) were 
greatly reduced in Nf2-iso2−/− mice, indicative of axonal neuropathy 
(Fig. 6d). Apart from minor effects following proximal stimulation 
(possibly because of additional alterations in other tissues as a result of 
complete isoform-specific knockout of merlin), merlin-iso1 loss had 
no relevant influence (Fig. 6d). These results clearly correlate both 
homozygous and heterozygous merlin-iso2 inactivation with axonal 
neuropathy development. These findings are consistent with clinical 
findings suggesting that polyneuropathy in NF2 patients occurs in the 
absence of associated tumors (schwannomas)8,21 and that germline 
NF2 mutations cause merlin haploinsufficiency and polyneuropathy 
in patients22.

NF2 patient–derived mutations and specimens
We analyzed sural nerve biopsy sections from NF2 patients carry-
ing germline NF2 mutations who presented clinically with severe 
 neuropathy21. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed reduced phos-
pho-neurofilament staining per vital axon compared with healthy 
control biopsies (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Ultrastructural 
analysis revealed intrinsic axonal structure abnormalities that closely 
resembled those of Nf2-iso2−/− mice in vivo and neurons in vitro. Sural 
nerve axons of the same patients exhibited reduced interfilament 
distances compared with healthy control samples (Supplementary 
Fig. 9b).  In  addition,  non-myelinated  fibers  frequently  displayed 
irregularly  shaped  axons  containing  accumulations  of  condensed 
mitochondria and neurofilaments (Fig. 7b), as well as aggregations 
of pleomorphic vesicles and dense bodies (Fig. 7c) that could not be 
found in biopsies of healthy control individuals (Fig. 7d).

In vitro, the C-terminal nonsense NF2 mutation C784T, which was 
previously reported to provoke axonal type neuropathy determined 
by  electrophysiological  means8,  could  not  induce  neurofilament

phosphorylation or axonal diameter growth in P19 cells (Fig. 7e). 
This mutation was still able to form a complex with p190RhoGAP, 
but could not bind RhoGDI (Fig. 7f), demonstrating the importance 
of the merlin-RhoGDI complex at least in intact cells. Furthermore, 
these findings were associated with a loss of RhoA activation (Fig. 7e) 
and  indicate  that  NF2  patients  lacking  the  intact  C  terminus  of 
one NF2 allele in neurons fail to regulate Rho-ROCK–dependent  
neurofilament  phosphorylation,  leading  to  insufficient  axonal  
structure maintenance.

DISCUSSION
We found that the ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein 
merlin (specifically merlin-iso2) functions intrinsically in neurons to 
regulate axonal integrity and propose that reduced NF2 gene dosage  
in  axons  is  relevant  in  NF2-related  polyneuropathy.  Specifically,  
we found that merlin-iso2 regulates RhoA, leading to downstream 
ROCK activity, which promotes neurofilament phosphorylation and ulti-
mately controls the growth of axonal diameter in vitro and axon structure 
maintenance in vivo. Consequently, merlin-iso2 reduction resulted in 
inhibition of RhoA and neurofilament hypophosphorylation.

Irregular  neurofilament  phosphorylation  has  been  previously 
reported  to  coincide  with  axonal  dysfunction23  and  increased 
axon vulnerability24. Several neuropathic disorders display altered  
neurofilament phosphorylation levels2. Our results highlight impor-
tance of neurofilament modulation and provide, to the best of our 
knowledge, the first in vivo evidence that Rho-ROCK signals are 

important for neurofilament phosphorylation and the consequent 
maintenance of axonal structure.

While exploring how merlin-iso2 operates in the axon, we iden-
tified  a  merlin-dependent  multi-protein  complex.  Both  RhoGDI 
and p190RhoGAP, important determinants for Rho activity control, 
were found to associate with neuronal merlin. Our data suggest that 
axonally expressed merlin-iso2, coupled to neurofilaments, acts as a 
tethering system, fine-tuning local RhoA signals in the axon. A NF2 
patient–derived mutation causing severe polyneuropathy (C784T)21, 
which maintains p190RhoGAP interaction, but results in deficient 
RhoGDI binding, was unable to promote Rho activity and radial axon 
growth in vitro, illustrating the importance of the merlin-RhoGDI 
complex in intact cells. This scaffold-mediated assembly provides a 
versatile tool for the spatiotemporal organization of signal transduc-
tion. Specific merlin signaling hubs defined to cellular substructures 
such as axons enable Rho-ROCK signals to promote phosphorylation 
of neurofilaments, which is important for axon structure.

Our data contribute to the mechanistic understanding of why NF2 
patients suffer from polyneuropathy even in the absence of nerve 
damaging tumors. Merlin was originally identified as a tumor sup-
pressor  protein  and  is  known  to  be  involved  in  gliogenic  tumor 
development. It is assumed, but not proven, that the cause of nerve 
damaging processes associated with NF2 disease is a result of sec-
ondary problems, such as compressive glial cell tumors (schwanno-
mas)8,22,25 or hyperproliferative Schwann cells (tumorlets)8. We found 
that NF2 patients have axon-intrinsic ultrastructural irregularities and 

432

controls, indicating that the nerve damage in NF2 patients develops 
from an inner axonal process resulting from reduced merlin protein 
levels. This neuron-intrinsic impairment was verified in our mouse 
model, in which the specific loss of merlin-iso2, or even a reduction 
in the merlin-iso2 dosage, resulted in nerve damage and neuropathic 
symptoms without the appearance of Schwann cell–derived tumors. 
Despite  the  described  axonal  abnormalities,  we  could  not  detect  
classical signs of axon degeneration in Nf2-iso2−/− mice. We observed 
a phenotype resembling ‘axonal atrophy’, with shrunken and collapsed 
axons of peripheral nerves as have described previously in the con-
text of neurofilament mutations18. We detected neuropathy of axonal 
origin in mutant mice and propose that the loss of merlin-iso2 leads 
to a reduction of functional axons.

Our findings are unexpected for this tumor suppressor and rele-
vant for a complete understanding of the spectrum of nervous system 
abnormalities in the human NF2 disease. It is reasonable to assume 
that the signaling pathway downstream of merlin that we describe has 
a broader implication for other hereditary neuropathies whose mecha-
nisms remain elusive. Elucidation of the signaling pathways of radial 
axonal growth and maintenance is will be necessary to fully understand 
nerve regeneration and protection from axonal degeneration.

experimental animals. All mice handled in strict adherence to local govern-
mental  and  institutional  animal  care  regulations  (Thüringer  Landesamt  für 
Lebensmittelsicherheit  und  Verbraucherschutz).  Nf2-iso1−/−  and  Nf2-iso2−/− 
mice were generated by M.N.-K. and M.G. (unpublished data) and purchased 
from Riken BioResource (C57BL/6 background). Average day of birth, on the 
19th day of pregnancy, was defined as P0 and adult was defined as P60. Behavior 
and electrophysiology tests, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy 
were carried out on mice or tissue taken from 8-week-old mice unless otherwise 
stated. All of the mice used for this study were age and gender matched, as well as 
derived from group housing. Genotyping was performed by PCR of tail biopsies. 
For Nf2-iso1−/− mice, the primers Nf2 insert (5′-CCT CAA GCC CAA GGC AGA 
AGA-3′) and Nf2 insert2a (5′-CCT CAG AGT GAG GCA GTC TTC TAG G-3′) 
were used, yielding 267 bp or 391 bp products for wild-type or knockout alleles, 
respectively. For Nf2-iso2−/− mice, primers Nf2 (5′-CAG TAC ACC TGA GGT 
CAC TGT CTC-3′) and Nf2 insert2a were used to generate 235 bp and 378 bp 
products for knockout and wild-type alleles, respectively.

Immunohistochemistry. Mice were perfused transcardially using phosphate- 
buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (vol/vol) in PBS. Following 
dissection, brains were post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 20 °C. Floating 
sections were cut to 50 µm thicknesses or to 8 µm thickness for paraffin-embedded  
sections.  Floating  sections  were  heated  in  10  mM  sodium  citrate  buffer  
(pH 9) at 80 °C for 30 min and, after cooling, incubated in 2% non-fat dry milk 
(vol/vol) for 30 min. Sections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (vol/vol) for  
30 min and incubated in 0.2% gelatine and 2% goat serum (vol/vol) diluted in PBS 
for 2 h. Sections were submersed in primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C. 
For primary antibodies, we used antibodies to calbindinD-28k (rabbit polyclonal, 
1:2,000, Swant, clone CB38), MBP (mouse monoclonal, 1:500, clone MAB384, 
Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) phospho-neurofilament (SMI31, 1:500, 
Hiss Diagnostics), merlin (A-19, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and merlin-
iso1 (WA27, 1:100) and merlin-iso2 (WA28, 1:100) (D.H.G.)26. The rabbit poly-
clonal merlin antibodies were raised after repeated immunizations and peptide 
purification (WA27, C-PQAQGRRPICI; WA28, C-LTLQSAKARVAFFEEL). After 
vigorous washings, sections were incubated with the secondary antibody solu-
tion (Alexa488- and Alexa546-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit, 
1:500 in PBS, A-11034 and A-11030, Invitrogen) at 20 °C for 2 h. Sections were 
counterstained using Hoechst 34580 (1 µg ml−1 PBS, 5 min), washed for at least  
1 h and embedded in Mowiol. Merlin-specific staining was confirmed previously9 
and we tested the antibody to merlin-iso2 antibody on tissues from Nf2-iso2−/− 
mice (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Paraffin-embedded sections were rehydrated, boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate 
buffer (pH 9) for 30 min in a microwave and subsequently treated with 0.5% 
Triton X-100 for 10 min. Sections were incubated in 0.2% gelatine and 2% goat 
serum diluted in PBS for at least 2 h. Sections were submersed in the primary 
antibody solution overnight at 4 °C. For primary antibodies, we used antibodies  
to  phospho-neurofilament  (SMI31,  1:500,  Hiss  Diagnostics),  merlin-iso1  
(WA-27, 1:100), merlin-iso2 (WA-28, 1:100) and APP (rabbit polyclonal anti-
body, Calbiochem, 1:500, 171610). After vigorous washings, sections incubated 
with secondary antibody solution (Alexa488- and Alexa546-conjugated goat 
antibodies to mouse or rabbit, 1:500 in PBS, Invitrogen) at 20 °C for 2 h. Finally, 
specimens were washed in PBS, counterstained using Hoechst 34580 (1 µg ml−1 
PBS, 5 min), dehydrated and embedded.

Immunocytochemistry. P19 cells, primary cerebellar neurons or DRG cells 
were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 
min. After washing in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 
for 1 min and incubated for 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin (vol/vol). Cells 
incubated with primary antibodies at 20 °C for 1 h. For primary antibodies, we 
used antibody to phosphor-neurofilament (SMI31, 1:200, Hiss Diagnostics), 
RhoGDI (A-20, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), growth-associated protein 
(GAP-43, clone H-100, 1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), APP (rabbit poly-
clonal antibody, Calbiochem, 1:100), merlin-iso1 (WA-27, 1:50), merlin–iso2  
(WA-28,  1:50)  and  p190RhoGAP  (mouse  monoclonal  antibody,  Sigma, 
clone D2D6, 1:100). After extensive rinsing in PBS, cells were incubated with  
secondary antibodies (Alexa488-conjugated antibody to rabbit, 1:500; Alexa546-
conjugated antibody to mouse, 1:500) for 1 h. Cells were washed in PBS and 

counterstained with Hoechst 34580 (1:1,000 in PBS) for 5 min. Cells were 
mounted on cover plates with a Mowiol-based mounting medium.

developmental appearance of merlin in Purkinje cell axons. Axonal expression 
of merlin-iso2 determined by colocalization of merlin (iso2) with the Purkinje 
cell–specific marker calbindin. Continuous calbindin-positive signals in the 
granular layer of the mouse cerebellum with lengths of more than 20 µm were 
analyzed for additional merlin staining. Note the methodical difference with 
apparent discrepant results in a previous study9. There, the appearance of merlin 
in the proximal axon initial segment was monitored.

Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously27. 
For primary antibodies, we used antibodies to merlin (clone A-19, 1:500), actin 
(clone I-19, 1:1,500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RhoA (1:500, Upstate), phospho- 
neurofilament  (SMI31,  1:500,  Hiss  Diagnostics),  pan-axonal  neurofilament 
(SMI312, 1:500, Hiss Diagnostics), Flag (clone M2, 1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich), 
RhoGDI (A-20, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), merlin-iso1 (WA-27, 1:500), 
merlin-iso2 (WA-28, 1:500) and p190RhoGap (mouse monoclonal antibody, 
Sigma, clone D2D6, 1:1,000). Western blot results were quantified using gel  
analysis software by ImageJ. Density values were normalized to actin and appro-
priate controls of transfection or wild-type tissue.

Pulldowns to detect active RhoA. A detection kit was used (Active Rho Pull-
Down and Detection Kit, Pierce Biotechnology) according to manufacturer 
instructions. Precipitates and total lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE 
gel and immunoblotted using antibody to RhoA (1:500, Upstate). Total lysates 
were used as loading controls. Pulldown assays were repeated at least three times 
in each case.

P19 cell culture. P19 cells11 purchased from ATCC (CRL-1825) maintained 
in  Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle’s  medium  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  calf  
serum  (vol/vol).  Induction  of  neuronal  phenotype,  aggregates  were  gener-
ated on bacterial-grade dishes and treated with 5 × 10−7 M all-trans retinoic 
acid (Sigma) for 4 d. Cells were re-plated on cell culture dishes in the absence  
of retinoic acid.

Primary dissociated cerebellar cultures. Primary dissociated cerebellar cultures 
(referred to as cerebellar granular cells) were established from cerebellar tissue 
of 8-d-old pups (C57BL/6 mice) as described previously28. Cells were grown  
at  a  density  of  200,000  cells  cm−2  in  defined  neurobasal  medium  with  B27  
supplement (Invitrogen).

dRg culture. Cells were prepared from 4–6-d-old mice (P4–6) as described29. 
Arabinofuranosyl cytidine (Sigma, C1768, working concentration of 10 µM) was 
used to assure glial-free conditions.

Transfection procedures. P19 cells were transfected 3–4 d after plating using 
Lipofectamine  2000  (Invitrogen)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol. 
Transfection efficiency averaged around 45 to 50%. For siRNA knockdown 
experiments, primary cells were transfected using Dharmafect 3 according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific). Using siGLO RNA, 
a transfection rate of 75% was obtained. For overexpression studies, primary 
neurons were transfected according to a method described previously30.

For inhibition of merlin expression, the following oligonucleotides were used: 
si-nf2 5′-UAC CGA GCU UCG ACA UUA UUG-3′ (knockdown of both major 
merlin isoforms), si-iso1 5′-AAA GAA GGC CAC UCG GGA CUU-3′, si-iso2 
5′-UAG GUC UUC UGC CUU GGG CUU-3′ and scr-nf2 5′-AAU CCG GUU 
GCA UAG UUC AUG-3′ (untargeted control). For RhoGDI knockdown, siRNA 
was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-36416). For overexpression 
of merlin, pcDNA3-based Nf2 full-length sequences for isoform 1 and 2 was 
used. Backbone vector pcDNA3 used as control. Merlin fragment constructs 
used: N-terminus amino acids (aa) 1–299; C-terminus merlin-iso1 aa 300–595; 
C-terminus of merlin-iso2 aa 300–590. QuikChange Site–Directed Mutagenesis 
Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

For knockdown of p190RhoGAP, we used the pGIPZ plasmid containing 
shRNA against the ARHGAP35 gene according to manufacturers recommen-
dation (Open Biosystems, Oligo ID: V3LHS_349456, GeneID: 2909; antisense

the human gene, but is homologous to rat and mouse. In brief, shRNA was 
co-transfected with pMD.G-VSVG and pCMVdelR8.91 packaging plasmids 
into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h, the supernatant 
 containing viral particles was harvested, sterile filtered and used for trans-
duction of DRG cells. Thus, DRG cells were incubated with viral particles in 
DMEM/5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h and subsequently grown in DMEM/10% 
fetal bovine serum.

Quantification of axonal diameter in vitro. Diameters of axonal processes of 
differentiated P19 cells, primary cerebellar neurons and DRG cells were measured 
3 d after transfection. To identify axonal processes, cells were co-stained with the 
axonal markers GAP-43 and phospho-neurofilaments p(NF-H) (Supplementary 
Fig. 3a). Using the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ, axons longer than a cell soma were 
measured and scaled in micrometers. Processes that could be clearly distinguished 
from processes of neighboring cells were evaluated. Changes of axon calibers  
in vitro are also referred to as changes in radial axon growth.

microscopy and image acquisition. Confocal images were obtained with a Leica 
TCS SP5 laser-scanning microscope. Images were acquired with a 40× objective 
(HCX APO 40.0X 0.75 DRY, NA = 0.75) at a pinhole size of three airy discs and 
a resolution of 0.73 × 0.73 × 0.50 µm3. Images were taken from a single optical 
planes (voxel size = 189 nm). Epifluorescent images of dissociated neurons were 
obtained with a Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with a Leica DFC350FX 
camera. All digital processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For all 
images, only linear adjustments of the brightness and contrast were performed.

RhoA activation. Rho activator #CN01 (Cytoskeleton) was used according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Analysis of axonal caliber and myelination in merlin knockout mice. Analysis 
was carried out on semi-thin and thin sections of the sciatic nerve obtained 
from transcardially perfused Nf2-iso1−/−, Nf2-iso2−/−, Nf2-iso1+/−, Nf2-iso2+/− 
and wild-type mice. Mice were perfused with a solution containing 3% para-
formaldehyde  and  3%  glutaraldehyde  (vol/vol)  in  0.1  M  phosphate  buffer  
(pH 7.4). Sections were post-fixed for 1 h and kept in fixative that included 3% 
sucrose (vol/vol). Sections were obtained from the mid part of the sciatic nerve 
reaching from gluteal to the popliteal regions. Sectioning and staining was per-
formed as described31. Images of toluidine blue were stained semithin sections 
taken using an Axioskop 2 MOT (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 100× immersion 
oil objective and an Olympus XC50 digital camera (Olympus). Standardized 
settings for camera sensitivity, resolution (2,576 × 1,932 pixels) and brightness 
of illumination were used for all micrographs. Thin sections were analyzed with 
an electron microscope (EM910, Carl Zeiss) equipped with an integrated TRS 1K 
digital camera (Carl Zeiss). Image analysis was carried out using ImageJ version 
1.43u. RGB color images obtained from semi-thin sections were split into single 
channels, and the green channel was chosen for measurements. The picture was 
contrasted using the auto function. Using the freehand selection tool, the axon 
and the myelin was grossly circumscribed and the area was adapted using the 
ABSnake PlugIn (gradient threshold varied between 20 and 30, 10–20 iterations 
per image). Low-contrasted myelin sheaths were surrounded manually. Based on 
measured areas, we calculated the thicknesses of the axons and myelin sheaths. 
Providing a measure for bending of the transversely cut axonal surface, the axon 
was surrounded as described above and solidity factor was measured using the 
implemented ImageJ software tools (shape descriptor). Solidity factor describes 
the area covered by a given structure in relation to the smallest convex area, which 
covers this structure, that is, the solidity factor of a round circle or ellipse would 
be 1, while whereas circle with an invagination would give a factor smaller than 1.  
This solidity factor is superior to the circularity factor often used for measuring 
changes in surface structures, as it provides a factor to measure changes in sur-
face curvatures independent of the plane of section. Changes of axon structure  
in vivo are also referred to as axon structure maintenance or integrity. Three pairs 
of mice from the same litter were used for experiments. Electron microscopical 
images were taken from 50-nm-thick sections. Neurofilaments are easily iden-
tified by size and compact structure. The positions of all neurofilaments in a 
defined area covering only tangentially cut neurofilaments were measured and 
distances to their neighbors evaluated. The nearest neighbor of a neurofilament 

was defined as the average distance of the three nearest neighbors of a neurofila-
ment. The values provided in Figure 5b–d are derived from 300 to 800 distances 
measured per genotype. At least two mice were taken per genotype. Axon calibers 
were classified as described previously32.

muscle preparations and immunostainings. Preparations were carried out as 
described before33. BTX (Invitrogen, conjugated to Texas Red) was used at a 
concentration of 1 µg ml−1, and antibody to N52 (Sigma) was used at a dilution 
of 1:500. Silver staining was done as described34. Images were taken with standard 
bright-field upright microscopes. Images of fluorescent stains were taken using 
the Leica laser-scanning microscope LSM TCS SP2. Pictures shown are maximum 
projections of ten images taken at a distance of 1 µm.

co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed  
as described previously27.

kinase screening assay. We selected 23 serine/threonine kinases on the basis 
of  reports  of  their  association  with  merlin  and/or  neurofilament  signaling 
(Supplementary  Table  1).  Appropriate  siGENOME  SMARTpool  duplexes 
(Thermo Fisher) targeting kinases were transfected into neuronally differenti-
ated P19 cells. Medium was replaced after 24 h, following plasmid transfection of 
either an empty vector control or merlin-iso2. After 2 additional days, cells were 
lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to determine the phos-
phorylation state of heavy subunit neurofilaments (pNF-H). Consistent results 
were obtained in three consecutive experiments in 24-well plate format.

Sural nerve biopsies of nF2 patients. Biopsy sections for immunohistochem-
istry were provided by C.H. For phospho-neurofilament analysis, specimens of 
two healthy control males (57 and 52 years of age) were compared with nerve 
tissue from two NF2 patients (both 36 years of age), referred to as patients 
718 and 21.3 in ref. 21. Sections were stained for phosphorylated neurofila-
ment epitopes using antibody to SMI31 (Fig. 7a). Monochrome single-channel 
images were excused from fluorescent background staining by threshold setting 
to a range of 95 to 255 (Fig. 7a). By means of ImageJ plugin Analyze Particles, 
total area covered by phospho-neurofilament staining was determined as pixel2 
per µm2 and subsequently divided by the number of vital axons. Taking the 
total axon number into account, the decrease was not simply a result of loss of 
fibers. Quantifications of interfilament distances (Supplementary Fig. 9b) was 
performed as described above.

NF2 sural nerve biopsies for ultrastructural analysis of non-myelinated fibers 
(mutation in patient A: A1447-2G, age 37; mutation in patient B: 1594 ins3 del59, 
age 27) were kindly provided by C.O.H. Nerve specimens were fixed in 3.9% 
phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde, embedded in epoxy resin and processed for 
electron microscopy as described previously23.

The  immunohistochemical  and  ultrastructural  studies  were  performed 
on  archival  tissue  that  was  processed  and  diagnosed  in  the  Institutes  of 
Neuropathology in Hamburg and Aachen. According to the law for hospitals in 
Hamburg (Germany) and North Rhine–Westphalia (Germany), samples of closed 
cases that were processed and investigated in a medical institution may be used 
for research purposes by the same institution without need for a separate written 
informed consent from the patients.

gST-pulldown assays. GST-RhoGDI (in pGEX2T vector backbone). For pull-
down assays from bacteria lysates, frozen pellets of bacteria induced for protein 
expression were resuspended and lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 
100 mM NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS (vol/vol) and protease inhibitor cocktail. Samples 
were sonicated on ice for 5–10 min and cell debris was collected for 15 min at 
12,000g and 4 °C. Cleared lysates were diluted in 1 ml of pulldown buffer and 
incubated with GST alone or GST-tagged proteins bound to glutathione beads 
for 1.5-2 h rotating at 4 °C. Four washing steps were performed with 1 ml of 
pulldown buffer. Simultaneously, beads were spun down at 5,000g for 30 s and 
boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by subsequent SDS-PAGE and 
western blotting.

Protein interactions in vitro. We applied 1.5 µg of purified His-RhoGDIα

FERM domain or BSA in 0.5% CHAPS, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl 
at 20 °C, respectively. After three washes with TBS-Tween, membranes were 
treated with antibody to merlin (A-19, 1:750) for 1 h at 20 °C, followed by incuba-
tion with horseradish peroxidase–coupled antibody to rabbit (1:2,000) for 1 h.

nucleotide exchange assay. Assay was performed on the basis of a Rho GEF 
exchange assay kit (Cytoskeleton BK100) according to manufacturers recom-
mendation. In brief, 2× exchange reaction buffer contained 1.5 µM mant-GTP 
in 40 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM MgCl2. Samples containing 
a final concentration of 2 µM RhoA, 3 µM His-RhoGDI (aa 24–204, Fitzgerald) 
and 4 µM merlin FERM domain (aa 1–313, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mM 
NaCl) were pre-incubated on ice for 30 min in a black 384 round bottom well 
plate (Corning). The 2× exchange buffer was added to a final concentration of 
0.75 µM of mant-GTP. Samples immediately analyzed with a Mithras LB 940 
Multimode Microplate Reader (Berthold Technologies) at 20 °C. Fluorescence 
emission was recorded at 460 nm after excitation with lamp energy of 5,000 
(5.72 W) at 355 nm every 20 s. The hDbs GEF (human Dbl Big Sister) fragment 
was added to a final concentration of 0.5 µM and a total reaction volume of 
15 µl. Measurement measured for 6 h. Control protein samples components 
replaced by BSA.

Rotarod test. Measures motor coordination and proprioception. Determines 
time that mice can stay on a rotating rod, referred to as latency to fall. To increase 
test sensitivity, we used a program accelerating the rod from 1 to 50 rpm in  
4.2 min (accelerates at 1 rpm per 5 s). Each mouse underwent the same 5-d proce-
dure passing two sessions per d including two trials each session. Mice still on the 
apparatus at 252 s were scored as 252 s. Rotating on the rod for two consecutive 
rotations without running equaled falling event. Day 5 performances were used 
for statistical analysis using Bonferroni correction.

Hot plate test. The hot plate test measures response to thermal stimuli. Mice 
were placed on a horizontal surface that was heated to 55 °C. Subsequently, the 
latency for hind paw withdrawal was measured, with a 60-s cut-off time to prevent 
severe tissue damage.

electrophysiology. An investigation of the sciatic nerve conduction character-
istics in 8-week-old mice was performed as described previously35 in a blinded 
way.  Statistical  analysis,  results  of  six  gender-matched  mice  per  genotype  
were quantified.

Statistical evaluation. Differences between Nf2-iso1−/− and Nf2-iso2−/− mice and 
their appropriate wild-type littermates were determined. For all quantitative analyses, 
we compared two independent groups of experiments. To demonstrate their com-
parable distribution, we performed Levene’s test for equal variances. Comparisons 
between groups were made with unpaired t tests unless stated otherwise (SPSS soft-
ware, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). For each experiment we calculated 
the P value, the t value and the degrees of freedom. Differences were considered to 
be significant when P < 0.05. All values are presented as means and their s.e.
