Purpose: Although patients with neurofibromatosis are predisposed 
to multiple nerve sheath tumors that can develop anywhere in the 
body and cause significant morbidity (e.g., hearing loss; pain), little 
research  has  examined  emotional  correlates  of  neurofibromatosis. 
The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  examine  emotional  functioning 
among adult patients with neurofibromatosis.
methods:  A  total  of  248  patients  with  neurofibromatosis  (neu-
rofibromatosis  1,  neurofibromatosis  2,  or  schwannomatosis)  who 
received care at a specialized clinic completed validated measures to 
assess symptoms of depression and anxiety, level of perceived stress, 
and self-esteem.
Results: Patients with neurofibromatosis reported significantly more 
symptoms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of perceived stress, 
and lower levels of self-esteem as compared with general population 
norms. No significant differences were found among patients with 

neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis, and 
emotional functioning was not significantly associated with disease 
severity.  However,  increased  symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety, 
higher levels of perceived stress, and lower levels of self-esteem were 
associated with a higher frequency of self-reported medical visits in 
the past year (P values ≤0.05).
conclusion:  Neurofibromatosis  appears  to  be  associated  with 
reduced emotional functioning. Although further research is needed, 
these  findings  suggest  a  role  for  a  multidisciplinary  treatment 
approach  to  address  emotional  distress  among  adult  patients  with 
neurofibromatosis.

intROdUctiOn

The  neurofibromatoses  (neurofibromatosis  (NF)1,  NF2,  and 
schwannomatosis;  OMIM  #162200,  #101000  and  162091, 
respectively) are the most common neurologic tumor suppres-
sor syndromes and are a group of related neurogenetic condi-
tions characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple nerve 
sheath  tumors.  NF1  is  the  most  common  of  these  conditions 
with a birth incidence of ~1:2,700.1 NF2 and schwannomatosis 
are  less  common  than  NF1.  The  estimated  birth  incidence  of 
NF2 is 1:33,0001; schwannomatosis may have an incidence rate 
similar to that of NF2.2 These genetic conditions are transmit-
ted in autosomal dominant fashion with 50% risk to offspring of 
affected parents. Symptom severity varies widely among patients; 
however, the hallmark manifestation of NF1, NF2, and schwan-
nomatosis is nerve sheath tumors, including neurofibromas and 
schwannomas.  These  histologically  benign  tumors  can  occur 
anywhere  in  the  body  and  often  cause  significant  morbidity 
including disfiguring cutaneous tumors (NF1), complete hearing 
loss, facial weakness, and poor gait (NF2), and chronic disabling 
pain  (schwannomatosis).  In  addition  to  the  increased  risk  of 
benign tumors, patients with these genetic syndromes may have 
or develop malignant tumors and nontumor manifestations that 

affect the nervous system, eyes, and skin.3,4 Currently, there are 
only a handful of clinics in the United States that provide special-
ized care for adult patients with NF; the majority of such patients 
will be cared for by  primary-care physicians. Given the limited 
number of specialized clinics, as well as the substantial morbidity 
associated with the neurofibromatoses, it is imperative for clini-
cians to be familiar with these conditions.

Anecdotal  evidence  is  that  patients  with  NF1,  NF2,  and 
schwannomatosis  express  concern  about  their  present  and 
future  health  status,  and  about  the  possibility  of  transmitting 
NF to their offspring. Research with non-NF patient popula-
tions also highlights the emotional distress that may accompany 
chronic medical conditions.5 To date, however, research regard-
ing the potential psychological impact of NF in adulthood has 
been generally restricted to a few studies that have examined 
quality of life among patients with NF16–8 or NF29 and to a few 
that have assessed psychiatric morbidity among patients with 
NF1  only.10–12  For  example,  12-year  follow-up  of  48  Swedish 
patients with NF1 (37 were evaluated for psychiatric disorders 
at follow-up) found that one-third of the patients met criteria 
for at least one psychiatric disorder.11 Psychiatric disorders were 
significantly more common among patients as compared with

WANG et al  |  Emotional function of patients with NF

controls. At least one study also examined responses to receiv-
ing a diagnosis among 20 patients with NF2 and found that eight 
patients reported negative emotional responses such as anxiety.13 
To our knowledge, however, in-depth studies of psychological 
and emotional functioning are rare in the NF literature and no 
such studies have included patients with schwannomatosis.

To address this gap in the literature, we examined emotional 
functioning in adult patients with NF1, NF2, and schwannoma-
tosis (both in comparison with population norms and between 
patient groups). The term emotional functioning was used in this 
study to refer to patients’ self-reported symptoms of depression, 
symptoms of anxiety, and levels of stress and self-esteem. We 
also examined whether clinical factors—specifically, skin mani-
festation (NF1), hearing impairment, walking status, and facial 
function (NF2), and pain (schwannomatosis)—were associated 
with patients’ levels of emotional functioning. Finally, given that 
decreased  emotional  functioning  is  associated  with  increased 
use of health-care services among patients with chronic medical 
conditions,14 we assessed whether level of emotional function-
ing  was  associated  with  the  number  of  self-reported  medical 
visits (a proxy of health-care utilization) within the past year. 
Although we expected patients to report poorer levels of emo-
tional  functioning  as  compared  with  population  norms,  this 
study was mainly exploratory and descriptive in nature.

mAteRiALs And metHOds

This project was a cross-sectional study examining emotional 
functioning among adult patients with NF. Patients who were 
18  years  or  older  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  NF1,  NF2,  or 
schwannomatosis and who were seen in The Family Center for 
Neurofibromatosis at Massachusetts General Hospital between 
January and November 2010 were recruited. This clinic special-
izes in the care of adult patients with NF and sees a large vol-
ume of patients annually (435 adult patients in 2010). Patients 
who were unable to comprehend the consent form because of 
cognitive  limitations  (determined  by  the  medical  provider), 
who were non-English speaking, or who had a medical condi-
tion that interfered with the ability to complete the study pro-
cedures (determined by the medical provider) were excluded 
from participating.

Eligible patients were asked to complete a paper survey during 
a scheduled clinic visit. Specifically, study personnel approached 
patients waiting in an examination room to inform them about 
the study. Interested and eligible patients subsequently completed 
the self-administered survey, which took ~20 min to complete. 
Participants who did not complete the survey during their sched-
uled clinic visit (n = 10) were provided with a pre-addressed, 
stamped envelope in which to return the survey and were asked 
to complete the survey at home. The study was approved by the 
Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners Review Board and all 
participants provided written informed consent.

demographic and emotional functioning measures
Demographics  and  medical  information.  This  questionnaire 
assessed  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  level  of  education,  and 

marital status. Health-care utilization was assessed by the num-
ber of medical visits in the past 12 months.

Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The Center 
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) contains 
20 items that measure the frequency with which symptoms of 
depression were experienced during the past week.15 Items are 
rated using a scale from 0 (rarely or none of the time; <1 day) 
to 3 (most or all of the time; 5–7 days); possible scores range 
from 0 to 60 and higher scores indicate more symptoms. The 
CES-D has been shown to discriminate between general and 
psychiatric patient samples, and although the CES-D is not a 
diagnostic tool, a score of 16 or greater is indicative of clini-
cally significant symptoms of depression. The general popula-
tion scores reported by Radloff15 were utilized for comparison 
purposes in our study. One item (i.e., I feel fearful) was imputed 
for the first 200 patients using means replacement because of a 
typographical error.

Perceived Stress Scale-4. The Perceived Stress Scale-4 contains 
four items that assess the degree to which situations in one’s life 
during the past month are viewed as stressful.16 Items are rated 
using a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Possible scores 
range from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating higher lev-
els of perceived stress. In this study, general population norms 
based on a probability sample of US adults were used for com-
parison purposes.17

Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale 
consists of 10 items that assess global self-esteem (overall evalu-
ation of one’s value or worth).18 Items are rated using a scale 
from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree), and possible 
scores  range  from  0  to  30.  Higher  scores  on  the  Rosenberg 
Self-Esteem Scale indicate higher levels of self-esteem. General 
population norms based on a recent probability sample of US 
adults were used for comparison purposes in our study.19

State-Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  for  Adults  form  Y2.  The  State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) form Y2, contain-
ing 20 items rated on a four-point scale from 1 (almost never) 
to 4 (almost always), was administered to assess trait anxiety.20 
Higher  scores  on  the  STAI  indicate  higher  levels  of  anxiety. 
General population norms reported by Spielberger et al.20 were 
used for comparison purposes.

To  contextualize  the  results,  we  identified  several  studies 
that utilized the CES-D and STAI (trait version) to study other 
medical populations, and have selected some of those studies as 
comparison for our results in NF patients.21–32

measures of nF-related clinical factors
Skin severity. For all participants with NF1, skin severity was 
rated by their medical provider. Specifically, the medical pro-
vider  was  asked  to  rate,  “How  severe  is  this  patient’s  main 
skin problem today (compared with other patients with the 
same skin problem)?” on the following 5-point scale: no skin

problem, mild case, moderate case, severe case, or extremely 
severe  case.  This  item  has  been  used  in  previous  research 
to assess condition severity among patients with NF1.33 For 
analysis, skin score ratings were dichotomized: patients with 
none and mild ratings received a score of 0, and patients with 
moderate,  severe,  and  extremely  severe  ratings  received  a 
score of 1.

Pain. The average intensity of pain was assessed for all par-
ticipants  with  schwannomatosis.  Patients  rated  their  pain 
using a numeric rating scale from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst 
pain”).

Hearing, walking, and facial function. Clinical data on hearing, 
walking,  and  facial  function  were  collected  from  the  medi-
cal  records  of  patients  with  NF2  only.  Hearing  function  was 
assessed using the most recent audiology report in the patient’s 
medical record. Patient hearing level was categorized according 
to the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium of the American 
Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery; this is a 
four-level scale in which hearing is rated based on accuracy of 
word recognition and pure-tone threshold.34 Walking status for 
patients with NF2 was determined from the most recent physical 
examination noted in the medical record and coded as ambu-
latory,  needing  an  assistive  device,  or  nonambulatory.  Facial 
function  was  assessed  according  to  the  House–Brackmann 
grading system, which ranges from normal function (grade 1) 
to complete paralysis (grade 6).35

statistical analyses
One-sample  t-tests  were  conducted  to  examine  potential 
group  differences  between  patients  with  NF  and  published 
norms  for  each  measure  of  emotional  functioning  (CES-
D, STAI, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Perceived Stress 
Scale).  All  emotional  functioning  measures  except  for  the 
CES-D  reported  population  norms  by  gender;  as  such,  the 
overall population norm for the CES-D was used for all analy-
ses comparing patients with NF to general population norms 
on  symptoms  of  depression.  Subsequently,  we  examined 
potential  differences  with  regard  to  emotional  functioning 
between patients with NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis using 
Kruskal–Wallis tests.

Two-sided  Wilcoxon  tests  were  conducted  to  examine  the 
relationship between skin severity and each measure of emo-
tional functioning among patients with NF1. Among patients 
with NF2, Kruskal–Wallis tests were conducted to examine the 
relationships between hearing, walking status, and facial func-
tion  and  each  measure  of  emotional  functioning.  Spearman 
rank  order  correlation  coefficients  were  calculated  to  exam-
ine the relationship between pain and each measure of emo-
tional functioning in patients with schwannomatosis. Finally, 
Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were conducted 
to  examine  the  relationship  between  health-care  utilization 
among  all  patients  with  NF  in  the  past  12  months  and  each 
measure of emotional functioning.

ResULts

Patient characteristics
Among  292  potential  participants,  16  patients  were  not  eli-
gible: 6 were non-English speaking, 6 had a medical condition 
that  interfered  with  the  ability  to  complete  the  questionnaire, 
and 4 lacked a diagnosis of NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis. Of 
the 276 eligible patients approached for this study, 248 patients 
agreed to participate and completed the baseline survey (90% 
response rate; see Table 1 for patient demographic and medi-
cal characteristics). The final sample included 133 patients with 
NF1 (n = 54 men; n = 79 women), 94 patients with NF2 (n = 44

men; n = 50 women), and 21 patients with schwannomatosis 
(n = 15 men; n = 6 women). In terms of medical characteris-
tics, a small number of participants in each patient group had 
been diagnosed with a malignant tumor in their lifetime, two 
(both patients with NF1) of whom had a malignancy that was 
related specifically to NF (i.e., malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumors). No significant differences were found with regard to 
the demographic characteristics of the patient groups.

emotional functioning: comparison of nF patients with 
population norms and comparisons between nF patient 
groups
Means and SDs of the emotional functioning outcomes are pre-
sented in Table 2. In comparison with published norms, both 
male and female patients with NF (NF1, NF2, or schwanno-
matosis) reported significantly more symptoms of depression 
than the general population (P values <0.001). Over one-third 
of male patients (n = 41) and approximately 46% (n = 62) of 
female patients scored at or above the clinical cut-off score on 
the CES-D as compared with 19% in the general population. 
Both male and female patients with NF also reported signifi-
cantly more symptoms of anxiety (P values <0.001), higher lev-
els of perceived stress (P values <0.001), and lower levels of self-
esteem (males: P < 0.05; females: P < 0.001) as compared with 
population  norms.  These  results  do  not  appear  to  have  been 
driven by one patient group in particular: there were no signifi-
cant differences between patients with NF1, NF2, and schwan-
nomatosis for either males or females on any of the emotional 
functioning measures (P values >0.05).

Associations between nF-specific clinical factors and 
emotional functioning
No  significant  relationships  were  found  between  skin  score 
severity and any of the measures of emotional functioning for 

patients with NF1 (P values >0.05) Among patients with NF2, 
there was a significant relationship between facial function and 
anxiety only (K = 12.81, P = 0.03); walking status and hearing 
function were not significantly related to any of the measures 
of emotional functioning (P values >0.05). Among the patients 
with schwannomatosis, there was a trend for pain and symp-
toms of depression to be significantly correlated (rs = 0.41; P 
= 0.06); pain did not correlate significantly with symptoms of 
anxiety,  levels  of  perceived  stress,  or  levels  of  self-esteem  for 
patients with schwannomatosis (P values >0.05).

Associations between emotional functioning and  
health-care utilization
The median number of medical visits reported by NF patients 
in the last 12 months was 4. Significant correlations were found 
between patients’ self-reported level of emotional functioning 
and  number  of  medical  visits  in  the  past  year.  Specifically,  a 
higher number of medical visits in the past year was signifi-
cantly related to increased symptoms of depression (rs = 0.19; 
P = 0.005) and anxiety (rs = 0.18; P = 0.006), higher levels of 
perceived stress (rs = 0.16; P = 0.015), and lower levels of self-
esteem (rs = −0.13; P = 0.05).

discUssiOn

We  surveyed  adults  with  NF  to  understand  how  emotional 
functioning may be affected among such patients, as well as to 
examine how such functioning is associated with common clin-
ical manifestations of NF. We also compared emotional func-
tioning among the different types of NF to understand whether 
any single patient group experienced poorer functioning. We 
found a consistent pattern of reduced emotional well-being in 
NF patients as compared with the general population. Of note, 
despite the different clinical manifestations associated with the 
various types of NF, this pattern did not appear to be restricted

to a single type of NF. Our findings, therefore, suggest that living 
with NF in any form may be associated with negative emotional 
consequences. Indeed, there are experiences that are common 
to all forms of NF, including the risk of current and future medi-
cal problems and the possibility of having affected children, and 
it may be that such experiences contribute to decreased emo-
tional functioning among some patients. The levels of anxiety 
and  depressive  symptoms  in  our  NF  sample  were  were  often 
higher than those reported by patients with other chronic dis-
eases, including coronary artery disease and cancer (Figure 1).
Our  findings  also  suggest  that  increased  severity  of  disease 
is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  reduced  emotional  functioning 
among  patients  with  NF.  For  example,  in  contrast  to  previous 
studies that found more visible symptoms of NF1 to be associ-
ated  with  greater  effects  on  patients’  emotional  symptoms,6–8 
our study did not find a relationship between NF1 skin severity 
and emotional functioning. This difference may reflect how skin 
severity was rated in our study (with one item vs. multi-item vali-
dated measure). However, our findings also align with previous 
research that suggests that severity of disfigurement (in patients 
with various forms of visible disfigurement) is not necessarily pre-
dictive of the extent of psychosocial distress.36 Similarly, neither 
hearing loss, the cardinal feature of NF2, nor walking status was 
associated with self-reported emotional functioning in our sam-
ple of patients with NF2. Among patients with schwannomatosis, 
however, there was a trend for pain and symptoms of depression 
to be significantly associated. There is high comorbidity between 
chronic pain and depression;37 health-care providers should be 
aware of the need to assess for and monitor symptoms of depres-
sion among patients with schwannomatosis and pain and to refer 
to a qualified mental health professional when appropriate.

Our study also found that poorer emotional functioning was 
significantly  associated  with  an  increased  number  of  patient 
medical  visits  in  the  previous  year.  Although  little  is  known 
about NF and health-care utilization patterns, previous research 
has documented more frequent health-care use among patients 
with emotional and psychiatric problems.38 Further research is 

needed  to  understand  the  link  between  emotional  function-
ing  and  health-care  utilization  among  patients  with  NF,  and 
to explore whether treating emotional problems could reduce 
such use, and associated medical costs, in this population. To 
date,  psychological  treatment  protocols  with  demonstrated 
effectiveness for reducing emotional distress and targeting spe-
cific  problems  such  as  depression  (e.g.,  cognitive  behavioral 
therapy; mindfulness) have not been tested with patients with 
NF, and future research is needed to assess the application of 
psychological treatments for helping patients with NF.

There are limitations of our study. Although we were able to 
enroll a large number of patients with NF1, we were not able to 
recruit an equal number of patients with NF2 and schwannomato-
sis because of the lower prevalence of these diseases. Therefore, it is 
possible that our study may have missed true associations between 
emotional functioning and clinical factors such as hearing, bal-
ance, and pain. Second, this study relied upon normative data for 
comparison purposes, most of which were published years ago 
(e.g., CES-D, STAI, and Perceived Stress Scale norms) and may not 
reflect accurate levels of distress in the current US population. Our 
patients were also drawn from a single NF clinic in the United States; 
although the sample was representative of the patient population at 
this clinic, the results of this study may not be generalizable to other 
regions or populations with different sociodemographic charac-
teristics. In addition, medical provider ratings were used to deter-
mine skin severity ratings for our NF1 sample and may not reflect 
patients’ perceptions regarding severity of their disease; Benjamin  
et al.,39 for example, did not find significant correlations between 
patients’  perceptions  and  medical  classification  of  NF1  disease 
severity. Finally, although valid and reliable self-reported measures 
were  used  to  assess  emotional  functioning,  future  work  should 
assess psychological and emotional functioning among patients 
using structured diagnostic evaluations.

In sum, NF appears to be associated with reduced emotional 
functioning. Going forward, it is critical for physicians, caregiv-
ers, and patients to be aware of the emotional factors associ-
ated with NF in adults. As well, it will be important for future

WANG et al  |  Emotional function of patients with NF

research  to  examine  whether  established  psychological  inter-
ventions are effective in helping patients with NF address their 
emotional concerns. We also see a need for comprehensive pro-
grams that incorporate psychoeducation, stress management, 
and support workshops to improve patients’ quality of life. The 
development of such programs, modeled on cancer survivor-
ship  clinics,  would  provide  opportunities  for  NF  patients  to 
(i) meet in groups to discuss the potential negative emotional 
consequences of living with NF; (ii) learn about advancements 
in  the  field;  and  (iii)  receive  services  that  address  both  their 
medical  and  psychological  needs.  Although  our  study  is  the 
first  to  examine  emotional  functioning  among  adult  patients 
with schwannomatosis, it builds upon previous NF1 and NF2 
research and underscores the importance of assessing for and 
addressing emotional distress among patients with NF.
