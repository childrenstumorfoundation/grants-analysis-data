Summary

Benign neuroﬁbromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are serious complications of neuroﬁbromatosis type
1. The epidermal growth factor receptor is not expressed by normal Schwann cells, yet is overexpressed in subpopulations
of Nf1 mutant Schwann cells. We evaluated the role of EGFR in Schwann cell tumorigenesis. Expression of EGFR in
transgenic mouse Schwann cells elicited features of neuroﬁbromas: Schwann cell hyperplasia, excess collagen, mast cell
accumulation, and progressive dissociation of non-myelin-forming Schwann cells from axons. Mating EGFR transgenic
mice to Nf1 hemizygotes did not enhance this phenotype. Genetic reduction of EGFR in Nf1ⴙ/⫺;p53ⴙ/⫺ mice that develop
sarcomas signiﬁcantly improved survival. Thus, gain- and loss-of-function experiments support the relevance of EGFR to
peripheral nerve tumor formation.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disor-
der, affecting approximately 1 in 3500 people (Huson, 1998;
Riccardi, 1992) The hallmark of NF1 is the development of up
to thousands of benign and slow-growing neuroﬁbromas; more
aggressive peripheral nerve tumors, known as malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), develop in 5–10% of pa-
tients (Evans et al., 2002; Friedman and Birch, 1997). The Nf1
gene on chromosome 17q11 encodes neuroﬁbromin, a Ras-
GAP (Wallace et al., 1991; Xu et al., 1990). Mutations in both
Nf1 alleles in some neuroﬁbroma Schwann cells and in MPNSTs
indicate that neuroﬁbromin functions as a tumor suppressor
(Legius et al., 1993; Sawada et al., 1996; Serra et al., 1997).
Ras activation (Feldkamp et al., 1999; Sherman et al., 2000)
and invasiveness of neuroﬁbroma Schwann cells (Sheela et al.,
1990) from human tumors support the idea that Schwann cells
play a key role in neuroﬁbroma formation.

Animal models of neuroﬁbromatosis that accurately mimic
the peripheral nerve manifestations of the disease were chal-
lenging to develop. In Nf1 knockout mice, no peripheral nerve
pathology exists in heterozygotes; offspring null at Nf1 die

in utero by E13 due to cardiac defects (Brannan et al., 1994;
Gitler et al., 2003; Jacks et al., 1994). Targeted deletions at both
alleles in chimeric mice (Cichowski et al., 1999; Vogel et al.,
1999) and most recently with the use of a conditional cre/lox
allele in Schwann cells in combination with a hemizygous Nf1
deﬁcient environment (Gitler et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2002) pro-
duced peripheral nerve pathology with features similar to plexi-
form neuroﬁbromas.

We have focused on identifying molecular alteration in cells
and tumors associated with Nf1 mutation in cultures and animal
models. These studies have led to identiﬁcation of aberrant
expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR;
ErbB1) in these tumor cells, and an EGFR-inducible protein,
BLBP, that may regulate Schwann cell-axon interaction in these
models (DeClue et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2003).
Speciﬁcally, EGFR is expressed in primary MPNST, MPNST cell
lines, and some S100⫹ Schwann cells in primary neuroﬁbromas
(DeClue et al., 2000). 23 of 24 cell lines derived from malignant
soft tissue sarcomas from Nf1:p53 compound heterozygous
mice were also found to express EGFR (Li et al., 2002). EGFR
gene ampliﬁcation is also observed in MPNSTs (Perry et al.,
2002). The identiﬁcation of EGFR was of particular interest, as

S I G N I F I C A N C E

An ongoing debate in neuroﬁbromatosis research is whether Nf1 mutant Schwann cells need cooperation from mutant surrounding
cells to drive neuroﬁbroma formation. This paper shows that EGFR expression in Schwann cells not only produces a tumor-like
phenotype in Schwann cells, but also drives mast cell accumulation and ﬁbrosis typical of human neuroﬁbromas, without a mutant
environment. The work deﬁnes a model of early neuroﬁbroma formation. In contrast to EGFR mutant brain tumor models, in the
peripheral nerve, a wild-type EGFR allele drives tumorigenesis. This work supports possible clinical utility of EGFR antagonists in NF1.

it is overexpressed or expressed as an active mutant in gliomas
and in breast, endometrial, ovarian, colon, and cervical cancers
(Yarden, 2001). Normal Schwann cells respond to products of
the neuregulin-1 gene, called neuregulins (Garratt et al., 2000;
Levi et al., 1995; Morrissey et al., 1995). These are ligands for
the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB3 and ErbB4, which bear
homology to EGFR (Prenzel et al., 2001). Wild-type Schwann
cells express the non-ligand-binding kinase ErbB2 and ErbB3,
but not EGFR (DeClue et al., 2000; Levi et al., 1995). Based on
these studies, we hypothesized that Schwann cell expression
of EGFR might be important in neuroﬁbroma and/or MPNST
development, and tested this idea by developing a transgenic
mouse strain expressing wild-type EGFR under control of a
Schwann cell promoter. We also show that genetic decrease
of EGFR in a mouse model system of neuroﬁbromatosis-related
malignancy reduces tumorigenesis.

Results

hEGFR expression, dimerization, and activation
in transgenic mice
To test the role of EGFR in neuroﬁbroma formation, we devel-
oped transgenic mice in which the 2⬘3⬘-cyclic nucleotide
3⬘-phosphodiesterase (CNP) promoter, speciﬁc for Schwann
cells in peripheral nerve (Chandross et al., 1999; Gravel et al.,
1998; Tsukada and Kurihara, 1992; Weissbarth et al., 1981),
drives expression of human EGFR. We raised and bred four
founder mice, and conﬁrmed presence of the hEGFR transgene
in two lines, designated CNP-hEGFR #10 and #46. Transgene
integration effects are unlikely, as two independent lines of mice
demonstrated pathology described below. We conﬁrmed
hEGFR protein expression with monoclonal anti-human EGFR
antibody to probe Western blots after immunoprecipitation with
a polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Figure 1A). We detected ro-
bust hEGFR expression using the same method in brain and
spinal cord, where CNP drives expression in oligodendrocytes,

with only trace expression in non-nervous tissues (Figure 1A).
We also detected hEGFR in sciatic nerve lysates from transgenic
but not wild-type mice (Figure 1B, left).

Ligand binding to the EGFR causes receptor autophosphor-
ylation, which leads to receptor activation as docking sites are
created for signaling proteins (Prenzel et al., 2001). To test if
expressed hEGFR in the transgenic mice is activated, we probed
Western blots of sciatic nerve lysates precipitated with anti-
human EGFR antibodies with an anti-phospho-EGFR antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, California). Sciatic nerve ly-
sates from CNP-hEGFR mice contained phosphorylated hEGFR
(Figure 1B, right), while lysates from wild-type nerves did not (not
shown). Consistent with a low level of phosphorylated EGFR, we
found no detectable changes in Ras-GTP or AKT-phosphoryla-
tion in Schwann cells from the mutant nerves as compared to
wild-type cells (data not shown).

Ligand binding to EGFR can induce homodimerization or
heterodimerization with ErbB2 or ErbB4 (Murali et al., 1996;
Prenzel et al., 2001). Receptor dimerization is necessary for
receptor activation. Schwann cells do not express ErbB4. We
tested if hEGFR/ErbB2 dimers are present in nerves from trans-
genic mice. HEGFR formed no detectable heterodimers with
ErbB2 in nerve lysates, although we easily detected dimers in
lysates from control RPMC cells (Figure 1C). Thus, hEGFR likely
exists as homodimers in CNP-hEGFR nerve. EGFR depends
on ligands for homodimerization and activation (Prenzel et al.,
2001). It is known that hEGFR transfected into mouse cells
signals appropriately when stimulated by ligand (Velu et al.,
1987). We analyzed expression of EGFR ligands in wild-type
and CNP-hEGFR sciatic nerves by quantitative real-time PCR
(QRT-PCR). We detected betacellulin, HB-EGF, and TGF-␣ in
wild-type and CNP-hEGFR nerves at approximately equivalent
levels. No message was detected for EGF, epiregulin, or amphi-
regulin (Table 1). Schwann cells puriﬁed and expanded in culture
expressed betacellulin and amphiregulin, conﬁrming that pe-

ripheral glia make EGFR ligands (Table 1). The data are consis-
tent with locally available ligands activating hEGFR receptors.
The CNP promoter drives expression in Schwann cells in
peripheral nerve and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
system (Gravel et al., 1998). We stained sections of mouse
nervous system for hEGFR using a species-speciﬁc anti-human
EGFR antibody. We detected no obvious defects in brain oligo-
dendrocytes, possibly due to unavailability of EGFR ligands in
the brain. There may also be little effect of isolated EGFR signal-
ing in oligodendrocytes even if ligands are available. In saphe-
nous nerve, we detected labeling of myelinating Schwann cell
sheaths and inter-axon endoneurium staining suggestive of
nonmyelinating Schwann cells (NMSC); perineurium was not
labeled (Figure 1D). We found no staining of wild-type nerve
(Figure 1F) as compared to the much larger hEGFR saphenous
nerve (Figure 1E). Levels of EGFR expression in Schwann cell
lysates were similar to, or less than, those in 3 Nf1;p53 cell lines
that express EGFR by Western blotting (data not shown).

Nerves of CNPase-EGFR mice are enlarged
Neuroﬁbromas enlarge nerves in NF1 patients. Gross inspection
of intercostal nerves, sciatic nerves, cauda equina, and cutane-
ous nerve twigs indicated diffuse hypertrophy in all CNPase-
hEGFR transgenic mice (data not shown). We gathered quantita-
tive data on nerve size in saphenous nerve. Saphenous nerves
are easily accessible in dissections and maintain a constant
diameter, without branches, over a lengthy segment. We mea-
sured nerve cross-sectional area (Figure 2A). We noted a sig-
niﬁcant, up to 8-fold, increase in area of transgenic nerves in
comparison to wild-type nerves (p ⫽ 0.001). Hypertrophy was
also noted in cranial nerves of transgenic mice (data not shown).

Hypercellularity in CNPase-hEGFR nerves
The histological basis of the nerve hypertrophy in CNPase-
hEGFR mice is attributable at least in part to hypercellularity.
We counted nuclei in hematoxylin-stained nerve cross-sections
and found them to beincreased 2- to 8-fold in hEGFR nerves (p ⫽
0.01, Figure 2B). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant change
in number of myelinated axons: wild-type saphenous nerves

harbored on average 465 large axons, while transgenic nerves
averaged 499 (n ⫽ 3 each; p ⫽ 0.32). Increased numbers of
endoneurial cells in mutant nerves could result from increased
proliferation and/or decreased cell death. We analyzed entry
into S phase of endoneurial cells in mutant nerves by labeling
with BrdU. In wild-type adult nerves, we detected the expected
low proliferation rate (0.4%) in 6 hr as previously reported (Brown
and Asbury, 1981). While the absolute numbers of BrdU-positive
nuclei were higher in transgenic nerves, the ratio of positive
nuclei to total nuclei was not signiﬁcantly different (p ⫽ 0.96)
(Figure 3F). We analyzed cell death as measured by TUNEL-

positive nuclei. We found 0.4% TUNEL-positive nuclei in wild-
type nerves (Grinspan et al., 1996); numbers of positive nuclei
in transgenic mice were not signiﬁcantly different (p ⫽ 0.16,
Figure 3E). Thus, ongoing increases in cell proliferation or de-
creased cell death are not detectable in adult nerves. Cell num-
ber increases may therefore occur at low levels throughout the
life of the animal, and/or at earlier times (see below). Human
neuroﬁbroma cells also show little proliferation and death
(Kourea et al., 1999).

Hyperplastic endoneurial cells in transgenic nerves might
be Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts, and/or perineurial cells; each
is present at variable levels in neuroﬁbromas. Wild-type and
CNPase-hEGFR nerve cells associated with myelin sheaths
showed cytoplasmic S100-positive staining, as expected for
myelinating Schwann cells (Mata et al., 1990) (Figures 3A and
3C), and p75NGFR immunoreactivity characteristic of non-
myelin-forming Schwann cells (NMSCs) (Figures 3B and 3D).
Greater than 90% of nuclei unassociated with myelin sheaths
were surrounded by GFAP-positive cytoplasm, supporting a
NMSC phenotype (Jessen et al., 1990). Continuous basal lamina
characteristic of Schwann cells were present on ⬎90% of cells
in the endoneurium of CNPase-hEGFR saphenous nerves in
electron micrographs (Figures 3G and 3H). Most endoneurial
cells are therefore Schwann cells; others may be ﬁbroblasts or
perineurial cells.

Unmyelinated ﬁber bundles and nonmyelinating
Schwann cells in CNPase-hEGFR mice exhibit
marked alterations which worsen with time
We analyzed electron micrographs to deﬁne nerve pathology.
Normal 4-month-old saphenous nerve contains large axons sur-
rounded by single myelin-forming Schwann cells and groups
of smaller axons ensheathed together by individual NMSCs
(Figure 4B). The same age transgenic saphenous nerves were
abnormal (n ⫽ 5) (Figures 4A, 4D, and 4E). NMSCs displayed
long aberrant processes which wrapped one or two, or no, small
axons. Collagen ﬁbers ﬁlled the nerve matrix between large
myelinated axons and were frequently, errantly, “wrapped” by
Schwann cell processes (Figures 3H and 4E, inset). Notably,
many Schwann cells in neuroﬁbromas lack contact with axons.
The increased size of CNPase-hEGFR nerves results from
an increase in the number of nerve Schwann cells (Figure 2B),
increased collagen, and increased myelin thickness. We mea-
sured myelin sheath thickness (n ⫽ 100) and the distance be-
tween myelin sheaths (n ⫽ 100) in electron micrographs from
3 wild-type and 3 CNPase-hEGFR saphenous nerves. Both pa-
rameters were increased (p ⬍ .0001; Wilcoxon nonparametric
test).

We observed the nerve pathology worsen with time. We
examined saphenous nerves at 4 months of age (n ⫽ 2) and
found that nerves had NMSCs with aberrant processes. Our
cohort studied by EM included 2-month-old (n ⫽ 2), 4-month-
old (n ⫽ 5), and 6-month-old (n ⫽ 2) transgenic mice. Nerves
progressively accumulated collagen and dysfunctional Schwann
cells, and had increasing numbers of disrupted small axonal
ﬁber bundles (Figures 4F–4H). These patterns of pathology sug-
gest a degenerative neuropathy of small caliber axons.

CNPase-hEGFR nerves exhibit increased mast cell
inﬁltration and ﬁbrosis
Neuroﬁbromas contain more mast cells than normal nerve
(Johnson et al., 1990). We observed granule-laden mast cells in

electron micrographs of hEGFR nerves (Figure 5A) and toluidine
blue-stained saphenous cross-section (Figure 5B). We counted
mast cells in saphenous nerve cross-sections. Mast cell num-
bers were signiﬁcantly increased in adult transgenic mouse
nerves compared to the wild-type counterpart (p ⫽ 0.004) (Fig-
ure 5C). Many mast cells were degranulating. Mast cell chemo-
attractants BDNF, MCP-1, SCF, TGF-␤1, and VEGF were each
upregulated in mutant nerves as determined by QRT-PCR (Fig-
ure 5D), likely accounting for the additional mast cells. Schwann
cell hyperplasia precedes mast cell accumulation. Compared
to the adult mice, in 4-week-old mice, Schwann cell numbers
increased signiﬁcantly in EGFR nerves (Figure 5E), while mast
cell numbers did not (Figure 5F). As mast cell products induce

ﬁbrosis, we conﬁrmed enhanced collagen deposition by tri-
chrome stain (Figures 5G and 5H).

CNPase-hEGFR;Nf1ⴙ/⫺ mice do not show evidence
of worsening pathology
Loss-of-function of Nf1 in Schwann cells cooperates with Nf1⫹/⫺
in other cells in one NF1 mouse model (Zhu et al., 2002). To
examine if Nf1⫹/⫺ worsened the CNPase-hEGFR nerve pheno-
type, we bred CNPase-hEGFR mice with Nf1⫹/⫺ mice. Dis-
section along the neuroaxis and peripheral nervous system of
double heterozygous mice revealed similar diffuse nerve en-
largement as in CNPase-hEGFR mice. Saphenous nerves of 4
double-heterozygous mice were signiﬁcantly larger (p ⫽ 0.0075)

CNPase-hEGFR mice develop rare nerve tumors
We aged 19 CNPase-hEGFR and 12 wild-type littermates until
moribund. 42% of EGFR mice and 50% of wild-type mice re-
mained alive at 23 months. We observed nerve thickening in
11 EGFR mice evaluated at autopsy, but found no consistent
cause of death. We observed a grossly enlarged spinal nerve
root in one mouse diagnosed as a neuroﬁbroma (Figure 6A).
Another mouse developed a nerve-associated spindle cell tu-
mor with muscle differentiation (Figure 6B). Desmin and S100
staining (Figures 6C and 6D) were positive, conﬁrming a diagno-
sis of triton tumor. We used an anti-human EGFR antibody to
probe Western blots after immunoprecipitation of brain and

tumor lysates from this mouse with a polyclonal anti-EGFR anti-
body (Figure 6E). hEGFR was enriched in the tumor, demonstra-
ting transgene association. We analyzed six CNPase-EGFR/
Nf1⫹/⫺ mice. Nerve thickening was consistent, but no nerve
tumors were detected, and no consistent cause of death was
found. These data suggest that EGFR expression can lead to
peripheral nerve tumorigenesis, benign and malignant, but that
frank tumor formation in this model is rare, even when mice are
hemizygous for Nf1 mutation.

Diminshed EGFR signaling decreases mortality
in the Nf1;p53 mouse tumor model
To determine whether EGFR expression is important for Nf1-
associated tumor formation, we mated Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺mice to
EGFRwa-2/⫹ mice. As previously described, Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺ mice
develop sarcomas and brain tumors at as early as 15 weeks of

reduces receptor tyrosine kinase activity by ⬎90%. Nf1⫹/⫺;

nant tumors and died by 26 weeks. In contrast, only 1 of 17
(5.9%) Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;EGFRwa-2/⫹ was dead at this time. This
mouse required sacriﬁce at 21 weeks due to a large periorbital
mass, pathologically diagnosed as a spindle cell tumor. Focal
S100 immunoreactivity and some mitotic activity allowed diag-
nosis of a GEM PNST, grade II (Stemmer-Rachamimov et al.,
2004). The remaining 16 mice remain healthy. Thus, decreased
levels of EGFR delay tumor formation and mortality in the
Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺ model.

Discussion

This study demonstrates the dramatic effect of expressing
EGFR in mouse Schwann cells. Peripheral and cranial nerves
in CNP-hEGFR mice exhibit diffuse changes that parallel the
hallmarks of human cutaneous and plexiform neuroﬁbromas.
These include increased endoneurial collagen matrix, dissocia-
tion of Schwann cells from axons, Schwann cell hypercellularity,
and mast cell accumulation. Changes were within the perineu-
rium, as is common in plexiform neuroﬁbromas. While previous
studies showed that EGFR is expressed in MPNST cells and

some neuroﬁbroma Schwann cells (DeClue et al., 2000; Li et
al., 2002), EGFR expression might have correlated with tumor
formation, rather than being a causative event. Strikingly, our
data are consistent with a causative, and early, role for EGFR
in progression to neuroﬁbroma formation. EGFR overexpression

is characteristic of, and contributes to, formation of many other
human cancers. Therapeutic reagents that target EGFR are in
clinical trials (Cunningham et al., 2004; Noble et al., 2004; Ran-
son et al., 2002; Yarden, 2001), and, based on our data, could
be considered as candidate therapeutics for NF1.

EGFR is not normally expressed in peripheral nerve Schwann
cells. We used the CNP promoter to drive hEGFR expression
in Schwann cells and speciﬁcally localized hEGFR to glial cells
in endoneurium. It was possible that hEGFR heterodimerization
with Schwann cell-expressed ErbB2 might occur, but we failed
to detect such heterodimers in adult nerves. We demonstrated
EGFR ligand expression in peripheral nerve, and in wild-type
Schwann cells. Based on these ﬁndings, it is likely that hEGFR
expressed in Schwann cells homodimerize upon ligand stimula-
tion, and become activated. Indeed, we detected phosphoryla-
tion of hEGFR in nerves.

This new model provided the opportunity to study early
stages in neuroﬁbroma formation, as pathology worsened with
age and proximally to distally. Electron microscopy showed that
abnormal axon-glial interactions were present by 2 months of
age. Schwann cells wrapped progressively fewer axons, and
ultimately dissociated from axons and wrapped collagen ﬁbrils.
Effects of hEGFR expression were signiﬁcantly greater on non-
myelinating Schwann cells than on those associated with my-
elin, even though both Schwann cell types expressed hEGFR.
This is consistent with enhanced sensitivity of the nonmyelinat-
ing Schwann cell to perturbed tyrosine kinase signaling down-
stream of hEGFR, driving abnormal neuron-glial interactions.
Emphasizing a role for critical levels of tyrosine signaling in axon-
glial interactions, Chen et al. (2003) showed that expression of
a dominant negative ErbB4 receptor signaling in adult nonmy-
elinating Schwann cells causes progressive sensory loss with
disruption of nonmyelinating Schwann cell bundles. Loss of the
adhesion molecule L1 might also be involved, as mice without
L1 also show disrupted nonmyelinating axon-Schwann cell units
(Haney et al., 1999). Human neuroﬁbromas preferentially arise
from sensory nerves that contain mainly unmyelinated Schwann
cells. Based on our results, many neuroﬁbroma Schwann cells
free of axons may have been associated at one time with small
axons.

Mast cell accumulation and ﬁbrosis are characteristic fea-
tures of human neuroﬁbromas and of peripheral nerves in
hEGFR mice. Mast cells did not express hEGFR on Western
blotting or immunostaining of tissue sections (data not shown).
Perineurial cells, of mesodermal origin, were also negative for
transgene expression. Nonglial cells accounted for few of the
cells in the hEGFR nerves. It is reasonable to postulate that
hEGFR signaling in Schwann cells stimulates production and
secretion of mast cell chemoattractants, and here we have con-
ﬁrmed that mRNA encoding the mast cell chemoattractants
BNDF, MCP-1, SCF, TGF␤1, and VEGF are each upregulated
in mutant nerve; one or more may recruit mast cells to the nerve.
Mast cells migrate to SCF secreted by Schwann cells (Yang et
al., 2003). Mast cell degranulation stimulates collagen deposi-
tion by ﬁbroblasts. Fibrosis is commonly linked to mast cell
degranulation (Krishnaswamy et al., 2001). Thus, Schwann cell
hEGFR expression could promote multicellular changes in pe-
ripheral nerve.

It remains possible that Schwann cell overexpression of
tyrosine kinase receptors in addition to EGFR could drive the
Schwann cell hyperplasia with ﬁbrosis and mast cell accumula-

tion documented. To our knowledge, to date, no other studies
have examined transgenic overexpression of tyrosine kinase
receptors in Schwann cells. However, the speciﬁcity of our result
is suggested, in that Schwann cell transgenic overexpression
of GGF␤3, a ligand for ErbB3, results in peripheral neuropathy,
but not in the ﬁbrosis and mast cell accumulation that we report
(Huijbregts et al., 2003). Prenatal treatment of mice with the
chemical carcinogen ENU (N-nitrosoethylurea) causes activa-
tion of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase in mouse Schwann cells (Bu-
zard et al., 1999). Such exposure induces invasive Schwann
cell tumors with interdigitating Schwann cell processes, cyst
formation, and parallel arrays of elongated neoplastic Schwann
cells in about 4% of mice from sensitive strains (Wechsler et
al., 1979); C57Bl/6 mice, such as those in our study, are highly
resistant. Carcinogen-induced mouse nerve tumors and growth
factor overexpression result in nerve pathologies very different
from those in the EGFR transgenic mice. Together with our
study, these data strongly support a key role for tyrosine kinase
pathways in regulation of non-myelin-forming Schwann cells in
peripheral nerve.

To better understand the relevance of EGFR expression to
malignant tumor formation, we mated Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺ mice to
EGFRwa-2/⫹ mice. In a mouse model of colon cancer, the wa-2
mouse decreased adenoma number and prolonged survival
(Roberts et al., 2002; Sibilia et al., 2000). In this study, reduction
in EGFR expression in Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;EGFRwa-2/⫹ mice de-
creased tumor formation and mortality signiﬁcantly. This data
supports a crucial role for EGFR downstream of Nf1 signaling.
MPNST formation is rare in the CNPase-EGFR-expressing mice
(shown here), as it is after chemical carcinogen exposure, affect-
ing only 0.05% of sensitive mice (Wechsler et al., 1979). It is
likely that additional genetic events are necessary for frequent
malignancy in the CNPase-hEGFR model. Other tyrosine ki-
nases are expressed in human MPNST (Badache et al., 1998)
and could contribute to tumor growth. In human, EGFR is ampli-
ﬁed in 26% of MPNST (Perry et al., 2002), so this receptor is
likely to be relevant to human MPNST tumor formation as it is
in the Nf1-driven tumor model studied here.

This study shows that EGFR expression in Schwann cells
results in nerve hyperplasia with occasional neuroﬁbroma for-
mation. To develop neuroﬁbromas at a higher rate, or malignan-
cies, it may be necessary to cross these mice to strains with
other mutations. Cre/lox mediated ablation of Nf1 in Schwann
cells resulted in nerve pathology similar to that observed here,
but only when the mice were also hemizygous for Nf1 mutation
(Zhu et al., 2002). Our model does not require mast cells and/
or ﬁbroblasts to be Nf1⫹/⫺, as crossing hEGFR to Nf1⫹/⫺ mice
did not increase nerve size or Schwann cell number. The similar
phenotype of hEGFR nerves to nerves in mice and humans,
with loss of function mutation at Nf1 (Cichowski et al., 1999;
Vogel et al., 1999; Zhu et al., 2002), suggests that when loss
of Nf1 predisposes Schwann cells, or their progenitors, to upreg-
ulate EGFR, neuroﬁbroma formation ensues. This new model
will allow testing of EGFR antagonists in vivo for their ability to
prevent the formation of tumorgenic phenotypes. This study
further validates EGFR as a potential target for therapeutic inter-
vention in NF1 patients.

Experimental procedures

Generation of CNPase-hEGFR transgenic mice
We subcloned the 2⬘3⬘-cyclic nucleotide 3⬘-phosphodiesterase (CNP) pro-
moter (Chandross et al., 1999) into a Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)

backbone. We inserted the human EGFR cDNA (Velu et al., 1987) into SstII
and XhoI sites in the newly created multiple cloning site downstream of
the promoter. We conﬁrmed sequence integrity by DNA sequencing (UC
sequencing core facility). We excised the promoter, EGFR cDNA, and SV40
polyadenylation signal with VspI and MluI, and injected it into C57BL/6-SJL
hybrid mouse oocytes.

hEGFR localization
We prepared tissue extracts using 10 ␮l buffer (1% triton X100, 50 mM Tris
[pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 1 ␮g/ ml
leupeptin, 1 ␮g/ml
pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF)/mg tissue. We incubated lysates at 4⬚C overnight
with goat polyclonal anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz sc-03g; Santa Cruz, CA), and
then with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz). We subjected samples
to SDS-PAGE on 4%–20% gradient gels, and probed blots with human
speciﬁc mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR (Zymed; South San Francisco, CA)
or with anti-phosphorylated EGFR (Santa Cruz). We developed blots using
an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham/Pharmacia; Piscataway, NJ).
We studied EGFR dimer formation by immunoprecipitation using a hu-
man-speciﬁc mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR (Upstate Biotech #05-101, Lake
Placid, NY). We ran 8% SDS-PAGE gels and probed blots with anti-ErbB2
(Oncogene Research c-neu; Cambridge, MA) or anti-hEGFR (Zymed). We
used the RPM-MC human melanoma cell line known to express ErbB2 and
EGFR as a positive control.

Immunohistochemistry and histology
We sacriﬁced mice by perfusion ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde and
harvested sciatic and saphenous nerves. We embedded nerves in parafﬁn
and cut 6 ␮m thick cross-sections; every ﬁfth section was mounted to avoid
double counting. We analyzed sciatic nerve sections proximal to the sciatic
bifurcation. We stained sections with hematoxylin for nuclear counts, tolu-
idine blue for mast cells, and Gamori’s trichrome for collagen.

We stained parafﬁn sections using a human-speciﬁc mouse monoclonal
anti-EGFR (Zymed). Sections were ﬁrst blocked for one hour using the Zymed
Histomouse kit. We used rabbit polyclonal anti-cow S100 (Dako, Carpenteria,
CA) and anti p75 (Chemicon, Teincula, CA). For ﬂuorescence microscopy,
we used Alexa-488 ﬂuorescent conjugated anti-rabbit secondary and coun-
terstained with bisbenzamide (DAPI) to identify nuclei.

Schwann cell proliferation and apoptosis
We gave mice three intraperitoneal BrdU injections (0.05 mg/gm) at 2 hr
intervals. We sacriﬁced mice, harvested nerves, and cut parafﬁn sections.
We detected BrdU uptake with biotinylated anti-BrdU antibody (Zymed)
followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated rhodamine (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Corp; West Grove, PA). To quantify cell death, we used
the TdT-FragEL DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Oncogene Research
Products). We counted nuclei with DAPI costaining.

Examination of nerve ultrastructure
We perfusion-ﬁxed anaesthetized mice with 3.2% glutaraldehyde with 3%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 10 min, followed by postﬁx-
ation in situ for 20 min. We harvested sciatic and saphenous nerves, rinsed
them with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, postﬁxed with 2% osmium tetroxide and
0.6% potassium ferrocyanide, and embedded them in Embed plastic. We
stained semithin sections (1 ␮M) with toluidine blue to count myelinated
axons by light microscopy. We viewed thin sections stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate on a Jeol 100CX electron microscope.

Detection of EGFR ligands by quantitative real-time PCR
We extracted messenger RNA from wild-type and CNPase-hEGFR mouse
sciatic nerves, or from mouse Schwann cells isolated as described (Kim et al.,
1995), using the Micro-FastTrack kit (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). We reverse
transcribed mRNA using the Superscript Preampliﬁcation System (Gib-
coBRL; Grand Island, NY) with Superscript II reverse transcriptase, oligo-
dT primers, and random hexamers per manufacturer’s protocol. We con-
trolled for genomic DNA contamination by omitting reverse transcriptase.
We ampliﬁed GAPDH as a control (sense, 5⬘-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-
3⬘ and antisense, 5⬘- GGAGACAACCTGGTCCTCAG-3⬘; product size, 300
bp) for each sample. We carried out quantitative real-time PCR experiments
in the presence of SYBR green using the primers amphiregulin (AR; sense,

formed replicate reactions in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System
Cycler according to manufacturer’s instructions. We conﬁrmed all PCR prod-
ucts on 2% agarose gels. We calculated ⌬Ct values relative to GAPDH
expression. We calculated the fold changes in CNP-hEGFR nerves com-
pared to wild-type nerves using the equation 2⫺⌬⌬ Ct, where Ct is the cycle
number at the chosen ampliﬁcation threshold as determined by PE Biosys-
tems software, ⌬Ct ⫽ Ct(ligand)⫺Ct(GAPDH), and ⌬⌬Ct ⫽ ⌬Ct(⫹/⫺)⫺⌬Ct(⫹/⫹) (K. Luvak,
PE ABI Sequence Detector User Bulletin 2).

Mice and genotyping
Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺ mice carry the Nf1 and p53 mutations in cis on mouse chromo-
some 11 (Vogel et al., 1999). Mice had been backcrossed six generations
onto the C57Bl/6 background at the time of the experiment. The tumor
spectrum on this background has been described (Reilly et al., 2000). We
obtained B6EiC3H-Egfrwa2 mice from the Jackson Laboratory and back-
crossed them one generation into C57Bl/6. We established the lines of mice
segregating Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;Egfrwa2/⫹, Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;⫹/⫹, Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;
Egfrwa-2/⫹, and Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺;⫹/⫹ by crossing Nf1⫹/⫺;p53⫹/⫺ with Egfrwa2/⫹
carriers. Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled viati-
cum that was kept on a 12 hr dark/light cycle with free access to food and
water. The animal care and use committees of the University of Cincinnati
and the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation approved all
animal use. We genotyped Nf1 and p53 alleles as reported (Vogel et al.,
1999). We genotyped Egfrwa-2 by PCR amplifying a 170 bp region (primers: 5⬘-
CCCAGAAAGGGATATGCG-3⬘ and 5⬘-GCAACCGTAGGGCATGAG-3⬘) and
digesting with FokI to produce an uncut 170 bp or cut 75 and 95 bp fragments
diagnostic for wild-type (wt) Egfr and Egfrwa2 alleles, respectively (Luetteke
et al., 1994).
