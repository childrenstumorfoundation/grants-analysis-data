Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disease that affects 1 in 3,000, is caused by loss of a large evolutionary conserved
protein that serves as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) for Ras. Among Drosophila melanogaster Nf1 (dNf1) null mutant
phenotypes, learning/memory deficits and reduced overall growth resemble human NF1 symptoms. These and other dNf1
defects are relatively insensitive to manipulations that reduce Ras signaling strength but are suppressed by increasing
signaling through the 39-59 cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway, or
phenocopied by inhibiting this pathway. However, whether dNf1 affects cAMP/PKA signaling directly or indirectly remains
controversial. To shed light on this issue we screened 486 1st and 2nd chromosome deficiencies that uncover .80% of
annotated genes for dominant modifiers of the dNf1 pupal size defect, identifying responsible genes in crosses with mutant
alleles or by tissue-specific RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown. Validating the screen, identified suppressors include the
previously implicated dAlk tyrosine kinase, its activating ligand jelly belly (jeb), two other genes involved in Ras/ERK signal
transduction and several involved in cAMP/PKA signaling. Novel modifiers that implicate synaptic defects in the dNf1
growth deficiency include the intersectin-related synaptic scaffold protein Dap160 and the cholecystokinin receptor-related
CCKLR-17D1 drosulfakinin receptor. Providing mechanistic clues, we show that dAlk,
jeb and CCKLR-17D1 are among
mutants that also suppress a recently identified dNf1 neuromuscular junction (NMJ) overgrowth phenotype and that
manipulations that increase cAMP/PKA signaling in adipokinetic hormone (AKH)-producing cells at the base of the
neuroendocrine ring gland restore the dNf1 growth deficiency. Finally, supporting our previous contention that ALK might
be a therapeutic target in NF1, we report that human ALK is expressed in cells that give rise to NF1 tumors and that NF1
regulated ALK/RAS/ERK signaling appears conserved in man.

Introduction

RASopathies, caused by mutations that activate Ras/ERK
signaling, are a group of related disorders with features that
include facial dysmorphism, skeletal, skin and cardiac defects,
cognitive deficits, reduced growth and an increased cancer risk [1].
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM 162200), caused by loss of
a RasGAP, and Noonan syndrome, caused by mutations that alter
Ras/ERK pathway proteins SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, BRAF,
CBL, PTPN11, or SHOC2, are the most common members of
this group, affecting 1 in 3,000, or as many as 1 in 1,000 live
births, respectively [2,3]. The genetics of these disorders provides a
strong argument
that excess Ras/ERK signaling underlies

common RASopathy symptoms, and much effort remains focused
on attenuating Ras/ERK signaling as a strategy for therapeutic
intervention. However, whether life-long pharmacological inhibi-
tion of Ras/ERK signaling is a viable strategy to treat the full
range of often non-life-threatening, but nonetheless
serious
symptoms of these chronic disorders, remains an open question.
This motivates our work to better understand the molecular and
cellular pathways responsible for NF1 symptom development, in
the hope this will identify more specific therapeutic targets.

Author Summary

tumors,

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease that
affects 1 in 3,000 and that is caused by loss of a protein
that inactivates Ras oncoproteins. NF1 is a characteristically
variable disease that predisposes patients to several
symptoms, the most common of which include benign
and malignant
reduced growth and learning
problems. We and others previously found that fruit fly
mutants that lack a highly conserved dNf1 gene are
reduced in size and exhibit impaired learning and memory,
and that both defects appear due to abnormal Ras and
cyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling. The former was unremark-
able, but how loss of dNf1 affects cAMP signaling remains
poorly understood. Here we report results of a genetic
screen for dominant modifiers of the dNf1 growth defect.
This screen and follow-up functional studies support a
model
in which synaptic defects and reduced cAMP
signaling in specific parts of the neuroendocrine ring
gland contribute to the dNf1 growth defect. Beyond these
results, we show that human ALK is expressed in cells that
give rise to NF1 tumors, and that NF1 regulated ALK/RAS/
ERK signaling is evolutionary conserved.

amino acid length [4]. Like human neurofibromin, the Drosophila
protein functions as a GAP for conventional (dRas1) and R-Ras-
like (dRas2) GTPases [4,5]. This functional conservation made it
the more surprising when both initially identified dNf1
all
homozygous null mutant phenotypes, a postembryonic growth
deficiency and a neuropeptide-elicited NMJ electrophysiological
defect, appeared insensitive to genetic manipulations that atten-
uate Ras signaling strength, but were suppressed by increasing
signaling through the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway [4,6]. The
genetic link between dNf1 and cAMP/PKA led to further studies,
which demonstrated that similar to many children with NF1 [7],
+/2 mice [8], dNf12/2 flies exhibit specific learning and
and Nf1
memory deficits [9]. Biochemical studies with fly brain extracts
further revealed that loss of dNf1 is associated with reduced GTP-
cS-stimulated but not basal adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity [9], and
with defects in both classical and unconventional AC pathways
[10]. Arguing that
the cAMP related function of NF1 is
evolutionary conserved, GTP-cS-stimulated AC activity and
cAMP levels were also reduced in E12.5 Nf12/2 mouse brain
[11], and defects in cAMP generation appear to explain the
unique sensitivity to Nf1 heterozygosity of murine central nervous
system neurons [12]. Arguing that NF1 may regulate cAMP
signaling at least in part in a cell autonomous manner, reduced
cAMP levels and AC activity were also found in NF1 deficient
human astrocytes [13]. Thus, while there is little doubt that
aberrant AC signaling is an evolutionary conserved NF1 pheno-
type, we and others have reached conflicting conclusions about the
underlying mechanism.

Based on Drosophila phenotypic rescue studies with human
NF1 transgenes, others reported that neurofibromin has physically
separable functions as a negative regulator of Ras and a positive
mediator of AC/PKA signaling. This conclusion followed from
findings that NF1-GAP activity was not required to rescue dNf1
size [10] or learning [14] phenotypes, whereas a transgene
encoding a C-terminal part of human neurofibromin that did not
include the GAP catalytic domain did suppress both defects. In
obvious conflict, in similar experiments with dNf1 transgenes, we
found that neuronal expression of a functional NF1-GAP catalytic
segment was necessary and sufficient to suppress the systemic
growth defect, and that other protein segments had no effect.

Drosophila Nf1 Growth Defect Modifiers

Moreover, the dNf1 growth defect was also suppressed by neuronal
expression of the Drosophila p120RasGAP ortholog, and although
we extended earlier findings by showing that heterozygous loss of
dRas1 or dRas2, or of a comprehensive set of Ras effector proteins
did not modify the growth defect, these mutations also did not
in the dNf1 central
reduce the elevated phospho-ERK level
nervous system (CNS). However, some Ras/ERK pathway double
mutants did suppress both defects, leading us to conclude that
excess neuronal Ras/ERK signaling is the proximal cause of the
non-cell-autonomous dNf1 growth defect [5]. Further supporting
this notion, recent work implicated the neuronal dAlk tyrosine
kinase receptor and its activating ligand jelly belly (jeb) as rate-
limiting activators of dNf1 regulated Ras/ERK pathways respon-
sible for both systemic growth and olfactory learning defects [15].
The above evidence underlies our hypothesis that loss of dNf1
increases neuronal dAlk/Ras/ERK activity, which in turn causes
reduced cAMP/PKA signaling, which may or may not be cell-
autonomous. Obviously,
identifying additional components of
dNf1-regulated growth controlling pathways followed by functional
analysis might help to test this hypothesis. Here we report results of
a dNf1 growth deficiency modifier
screen, which identified
components of
tyrosine kinase/Ras/ERK and neuropeptide/
cAMP/PKA pathways in addition to genes involved in synaptic
morphogenesis and functioning. Further analysis showed that the
requirement for dNf1 and cAMP/PKA in Drosophila growth
regulation involves different tissues, with dNf1 required broadly in
larval neurons, and cAMP/PKA signaling specifically in AKH-
producing cells and perhaps in other parts of the neuroendocrine
ring gland. These results, and the recent discovery of a novel dNf1
synaptic overgrowth phenotype [16] that is also suppressed by
several genes identified in our screen, set the stage for further work
to more precisely define how loss of dNf1 causes Ras/ERK and
other signaling defects, the ultimate consequence of which is
reduced systemic growth.

Results

Loss of dNf1 Does Not Phenocopy Starvation or Alter
Developmental Timing

Animals use elaborate hormonal mechanisms to coordinate
nutrient availability and feeding with changes in metabolism and
overall growth. Since starvation or crowding during the larval
phase of the Drosophila life cycle reduces systemic growth [17], we
first examined whether the small size of dNf1 mutants reflected
reduced feeding. Arguing against this hypothesis, wild-type and
dNf1 larvae ingested similar amounts of dye-stained food
throughout their development (Figure 1A). Unlike a pumpless (ppl)
mutant [18], dNf1 larvae also showed no tendency to move away
from a food source (Figure 1B). Analysis of the expression of the
starvation-inducible Pepck and Lip3 genes [18] provided further
loss of dNf1 does not phenocopy starvation
evidence that
(Figure 1C).

Mechanisms that control Drosophila growth have been the
topic of intense study and much has been learned about how an
interplay between insulin-like peptide (ILP) controlled growth rate
and ecdysone controlled growth duration determines overall
growth (see [19] and [20] for reviews). Arguing against an
important role for ecdysone or other factors that control the length
of the larval growth period, no differences in the expression of
canonical ecdysone-regulated genes was found (results not shown)
and no difference in developmental timing between wild-type and
dNf1 mutants was detected (Figure 1D and S1). Rather, a reduced
growth rate throughout larval development results in an approx-

imately 25% weight reduction of dNf1 pupae relative to isogenic
controls (Figure 1E and S1).

Drosophila ILPs control systemic growth, metabolism, longev-
ity, and female fecundity [21–24]. Among the eight Drosophila
ILP genes, Ilp2, Ilp3 and Ilp5 are co-expressed in bilateral clusters
of seven insulin-producing neurosecretory cells (IPCs) in the larval
brain [21]. Ablation of these cells causes a severe reduction in
overall size, which is rescued by inducing the expression of a hsp70-
Ilp2 transgene [22,23]. However, several results argue against a
role for ILPs in the dNf1 growth defect. Firstly, two hypomorphic
insulin receptor alleles, InR05545 and InR327, did not affect dNf1
pupal size (Figure 1F). Secondly, qRT-PCR analysis of RNA
extracted from wandering wild-type and dNf1 third instar larvae
detected no major differences in the expression of Ilp1 (not shown),
Ilp2, Ilp3, Ilp5, Ilp6 and Ilp7 in fed larvae. Among the three IPC
expressed ILP genes, the expression of Ilp3 and Ilp5 is reduced in
response to starvation [21]. Starved wild-type and dNf1 larvae
showed a similar reduction in Ilp5 expression, whereas Ilp3 showed
a less pronounced response (Figure 1G). Thirdly, while certain
insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate (chico) mutants have
an up to 85% increased life span [25,26], the lifespan of dNf1
mutants and isogenic controls was comparable (Figure 1H). We
note that others previously reported a reduced life span for the
originally identified dNf1 p-element alleles, generated in a different
genetic background [27]. Finally, we previously showed that Ilp2-
GAL4 driven UAS-dNf1 expression in IPCs did not rescue the dNf1
size defect [5]. Although daily heat shocking of hsp70-ilp2 carrying
larvae increased the size of dNf1 pupae, indicating that mutants do
not lack the ability to respond to insulin, similar induction of this
transgene, as previously noted [21], also substantially increased the
size of wild-type controls (Figure 1I). Thus, reduced insulin
signaling does not provide an obvious explanation for the slower
dNf1 growth rate, prompting us to perform a screen to identify
other genes involved in dNf1-mediated systemic growth control.

Screen for Dominant Modifiers of dNf1 Systemic Growth
Phenotype

While most dNf1 defects are poorly suited for use in modifier
screens, the postembryonic growth defect is robust and readily
quantified during the pupal
stage [4]. However, using this
phenotype in a screen is complicated by the fact that organismal
size is sexually dimorphic (females are larger than males) and
affected by population density, feeding, environmental factors and
genetic background differences. With these confounding factors in
mind, we used the crossing schemes outlined in Figure 2 to test
collections of isogenic 1st and 2nd chromosome deficiencies for
dNf1E2 pupal size modifier effects or synthetic lethal interactions.
For each of 139 1st and 347 2nd chromosome deficiencies from the
Exelixis [28], DrosDel [29] or Bloomington Stock Center (BSC)
collections, we generated Df(1)/+; Nf1E2/Nf1E2 (Figure 2A) or
Df(2)/+; Nf1E2/Nf1E2 (Figure 2B) stocks, respectively. Notably, our
work identified only few synthetic lethal interactions, and in all
cases
tested the synthetic lethality has been specific to the
chromosome carrying the Nf1E2 allele, and not observed when
the same deficiency was
trans-
heterozygotes [5]. To guard against size differences caused by
inadvertent differences in population density or environmental
conditions, each deficiency was scored at least twice using an initial
rough caliper measurement of pupae attached to the side of
culture vials. For each candidate modifying deficiency thus

tested in Nf1E2/Nf1E1 null

identified, microscopy combined with image analysis was used to
determine the precise head-to-tail
length of at least 40 pupae,
which were then allowed to individually eclose in order to establish
their sex. Several controls were next performed to eliminate non-
specific modifiers or artifactual results. First, for all suppressors the
continued presence of the Nf1E2 nonsense mutation was confirmed
by a PCR assay (Figure S2). Secondly, as a critical specificity
control, all modifying deficiencies were analyzed in a wild-type
background to eliminate those that affect pupal size irrespective of
dNf1 genotype. Further analysis of some of these non-specific
modifiers demonstrated that loss of Act57B dominantly increases
pupal size, whereas heterozygous loss of the glutamate transporter
Eaat1 has the opposite effect. Thirdly, because pupal size is a
function of larval growth rate and duration, modifying deficiencies
were monitored for obvious changes in developmental timing.
Table 1 shows the number of screened chromosome 1, 2L and 2R
deficiencies, the fraction of genes uncovered and the number of
dNf1 and wild-type pupal size modifying deficiencies and loci
identified. Figure 2C shows the magnitude of the pupal size
modification of typical enhancers and suppressors. The number of
modifying deficiencies exceeds the number of
identified loci,
because many modifying deficiencies uncover overlapping geno-
mic segments (Figure 3). Not unexpectedly, individual modifying
deficiencies increase or decrease dNf1 pupal size to different
extents (Figure 4).

Some large non-modifying deficiencies identified in our screen
completely overlapped with smaller modifying ones. In such cases,
stocks were re-ordered and reanalyzed. If these tests replicated the
original
results, genetic complementation analysis or PCR
amplification using transposon and flanking sequence-specific
primers was used to confirm the mapping of the deficiencies in
question. This procedure identified several mismapped or
mislabeled deficiencies, most of which have since been withdrawn
by stock centers. Any suspect or recessive modifying deficiency, or
any deficiency that uncovers genes with non-specific size
phenotypes, such as Minute loci [30,31], were eliminated from
further analysis. Table S1 lists these deficiencies and the reason for
their exclusion.

suppressing Df(2R)BSC199

During work to identify genes responsible for observed effects,
we prioritized genes uncovered by suppressing deficiencies over
those uncovered by enhancers. We also prioritized modifying loci
uncovered by more than one deficiency, strong modifiers over
weak ones, and genes uncovered by smaller deficiencies over those
uncovered by larger ones, reasoning that effects of
smaller
deficiencies are more likely due to the loss of single genes.
Validating the screen, suppressing Df(2R)Exel7144 uncovers dAlk
and partially

Df(2R)BSC699 each uncover the gene for its activating ligand,
jeb, both previously identified as dominant suppressors of dNf1 size,

Other uncovered candidate modifiers, such as PKA catalytic and
regulatory subunit genes, were tested in crosses with loss-of-
function alleles and/or by tissue-specific knockdown using at least
two independent UAS-RNAi transgenes, most of which were
obtained from the Vienna Drosophila Stock Center (VDRC) [32].
For deficiencies that lacked obvious candidate modifiers, we used
the UAS-RNAi approach to more broadly screen uncovered
genes. Figure S3 shows examples of modifiers identified by this
latter approach. Although the nutrient sensing fat body and other
tissues outside of the CNS play important roles in Drosophila

by RNAi knockdown in neurons or glial cells. We focused on these
types, because neuronal UAS-dNf1 expression sufficed to
cell
suppress the growth phenotype [5].

The dNf1 pupal size modifiers identified to date can be classified
into three non-exclusive categories, the first of which consists of the

previously implicated dAlk/jeb receptor/ligand pair and two not
previously implicated other genes involved in Ras-mediated signal
transduction. Another expected category includes genes involved
in cAMP/PKA signaling, including the previously reported dnc
cAMP phosphodiesterase suppressor [35], and the newly identified
PKA catalytic subunit gene, PKA-C1, which acts as an enhancer.

This group also includes the CCKLR-17D1 drosulfakinin receptor,
recently implicated as a cAMP-coupled promoter of synaptic
growth [36], which is particularly interesting given the recent
identification of a dNf1 larval NMJ overgrowth phenotype [16].
Finally, our screen also identified multiple genes whose roles in
dNf1 growth control had not been anticipated and whose
functional relevance remains to be established. Several genes in
this group are predominantly expressed in brain or have known
neuronal functions, including genes coding for the aforementioned
CCKLR-17D1 receptor, the synaptic scaffold protein Dap160, the
neuronal RNA binding protein elav, the neuronal Na,K ATPase
interacting protein NKAIN [37], and the larval brain and
alimentary channel expressed amino acid transporter NAAT1
[38]. Other genes in this group include CKIIbeta2, encoding a
casein kinase regulatory subunit,
trafficking
proteins deep-orange and carnation, the Notch modifier heparan sulfate
3-O sulfotransferase Hs3st-B [39], and the ubiquitin E3 ligases
HERC2, which acts as a suppressor, and CUL3, which has the
opposite effect. Table 2 lists deficiencies that modify dNf1 but not
wild-type pupal size, limited to those for which the responsible
gene has been identified. Table S2 identifies all analyzed
deficiencies, indicates which modified dNf1 pupal size (providing
female pupal sizes as a gauge of modification strength), which also
altered wild-type pupal
size, and which deficiencies altered
developmental timing.

dNf1 Pupal Size Modifiers Involved in Jeb/dAlk/Ras/ERK
Signaling

We previously reported that the dAlk receptor tyrosine kinase
[40] acts as a rate-limiting activator of neuronal Ras/ERK
pathways responsible for dNf1 size and learning defects [15].
Therefore, the fact that the dAlk and jeb genes are uncovered by
one and two suppressing deficiencies, respectively (Table 2),
validates our screen. Others recently reported that Jeb/dAlk
signaling allows brain growth to be spared at the expense of other
tissues in nutrient restricted Drosophila, and identified a glial cell
niche around neuroblasts as the source of Jeb under these
conditions [41]. To determine whether glial cells also produce Jeb
involved in overall growth control under normal conditions, we
used glial and neuronal Gal4 drivers to test the effect of tissue-
specific jeb and dAlk knockdown. Arguing that neurons are the
main source of Jeb involved in systemic growth control under non-
jeb knockdown with the Ras2-Gal4, C23-
starvation conditions,
Gal4, and n-syb-Gal4 neuronal drivers [5] increased dNf1E2 pupal
size (Figure 5A), whereas the Nrv2-Gal4, Eaat1-Gal4 and Gli-Gal4
glial drivers had no effect (data not shown). The only glial driver
that gave rise to partial rescue was the pan-glial repo-Gal4 line,
although this effect was not enhanced by co-expressing UAS-Dcr2.
Control experiments showed that any driver used in these and
other experiments had no effect on pupal size in the absence of

UAS transgenes or vice-versa, that UAS transgenes had no effect
in the absence of Gal4 drivers (Figure 5A and data not shown).
Finally, extending previous findings and further confirming a role
for jeb as a dominant dNf1 size defect suppressor, the jebweli loss-of-
function allele [42] dominantly increased dNf1 pupal
size
(Figure 5B)

Previously, heterozygous mutations affecting RAF/MEK/ERK
kinase cascade components Draf (pole hole; phl), Dsor1/dMEK, or
ERK/rolled (rl), did not modify dNf1 size [5]. In agreement, two phl-
uncovering deficiencies, Df(1)ED6574 and Df(1)ED11354, did not
score as modifiers (Table S2). No rl uncovering deficiencies were
analyzed, but Df(1)Exel9049, which is among the stronger
suppressors identified, deletes Dsor1 and only two other genes,
the neurogenic gene almondex (amx), and CG17754, predicting a
BTB and Kelch domain protein. Arguing that reduced Ras/ERK
signaling upon loss of Dsor1 combined with abnormal neuronal
differentiation due to loss of amx may synergistically cause the
observed strong effect, Ras2-Gal4 driven UAS-RNAi transgenes
lethality at 25uC,
targeting either gene, while causing pupal
increased dNf1 pupal size at lower temperatures (Figure 5C).
Moreover, suppression of the dNf1 pupal size defect was also
observed upon individual heterozygous loss of either Dsor1 or amx,
although at least with the tested alleles, combined loss of both
genes did not have a more pronounced effect
(Figure 5B).
Previously, we did not observe suppression of the dNf1E2 pupal size
in crosses with the Dsor1S-1221 allele [5]. A potential
defect
explanation may be that Dsor1LH110 is a null mutant [43], whereas
the molecular nature of Dsor1S-1221 is undetermined. Genetic
background differences between these Dsor1 alleles are another
potential explanation for the discrepant results.

identifying genes

Multiple screens aimed at

involved in
Drosophila tyrosine kinase/Ras signaling have been performed
[44–52]. Among the genes identified, several are uncovered by 1st
and 2nd chromosome deficiencies that do not modify dNf1 size.
Suppressing Df(2R)BSC161 uncovers 27 genes including connector
enhancer of KSR (cnk), a scaffold protein that functions as a bimodal
(both positive and negative) regulator of RAS/MAPK signaling
[53,54]. Supporting a role for cnk as a dNf1 modifier, the cnkXE-385
and cnkE-2083 alleles acted as dominant suppressors (Figure 5B),
and suppression was also observed upon RNAi-mediated Cnk
knockdown using Ras2-Gal4 or P(GawB)C23-Gal4 neuronal drivers
(Figure 5C). However, Df(2R)BSC154, which uncovers cnk and
only nine other genes, did not score as a modifier (Table S2).

dNf1 Size Modifiers Involved in cAMP/PKA Signaling

The dNf1 growth defect is suppressed by heat shock-induced
expression of a constitutively active murine PKA catalytic subunit
transgene, called PKA* [4], or by loss of the dunce (dnc) cAMP

Moreover, Ret-Gal4 driven expression of UAS-Ret

found in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 did not phenocopy the

dNf1 growth control, Ret

contrast, Dap160 loss-of-function alleles
(Dap160D1 and Dap160D2; [56]), or Dap160 RNAi expression driven

NAAT1 as the responsible suppressor, three neuronal Gal4 lines

expression of a dominant negative Pi3K92E transgene, did not
modify dNf1 pupal size [5]. Beyond B4, dNf1 size modifying
deficiencies uncovered no genes involved in the canonical growth
regulating pathways mediated by insulin and ecdysone. Indeed,
several such genes were uncovered by non-modifying deficiencies.
Among these genes, fat body expressed insulin-like growth factor
Ilp6, which regulates larval growth in the post-feeding phase
[66,67], is uncovered by two non-modifying deficiencies. A single
non-modifying deficiency, Df(2L)BSC206, uncovers both the chico
and pten genes, whose products antagonistically control insulin-
stimulated Pi3K92E/Dp110 activity, leading to changes in body,
organ, and cell size [68,69]. Among subunits of the cell growth
regulating mTORC1 complex, raptor is uncovered by three and
Tor by one non-modifying deficiency. Among genes implicated in
ecdysone signaling, the ecdysone co-receptor ultraspiracle and the
ecdysone-induced growth regulating DHR4 nuclear receptor [70]
are each uncovered by non-modifying deficiencies, and two such
deficiencies uncover Ptth, coding for prothoracicotropic hormone,
which provides developmental timing cues by stimulating the
production of ecdysone [71,72]. These results reinforce our
conclusion that
the canonical growth regulating pathways
involving insulin and ecdysone play no obvious roles in dNf1
growth control.

Manipulating cAMP/PKA Signaling in the Ring Gland
Affects dNf1 Systemic Growth Non-Cell-Autonomously

Several results argue that defects in Ras/ERK and cAMP/PKA
signaling responsible for the dNf1 growth defect involve non-
overlapping cell populations. Firstly, heat shock-induced hsp70-
PKA*, or Ras2-Gal4 induced attenuated UAS-PKA* transgene (see
below) expression rescued the dNf1 pupal size defect, but failed to
reduce the elevated larval brain phospho-ERK level (Figure 8A).
Moreover, several neuronal RNAi drivers that increase dNf1 pupal
size when driving UAS-dNf1 [5], failed to modify this phenotype
when driving dncRNAi transgenes, even in the presence of the UAS-
Dcr-2 RNAi enhancer (Table 3). This prompted us to investigate
whether genetic manipulation of cAMP/PKA signaling in cells
other than dNf1 requiring neurons was more effective.

To manipulate cAMP/PKA signaling tissue-specifically we used
three UAS-dncRNAi
transgenes. We also generated a series of
attenuated UAS-PKA* transgenes using vectors with modified
Gal4-inducible promoters harboring just 2, 3 or 4 Gal4-binding
UAS elements (Figure 8B and C). We made the latter transgenes
because a UAS-PKA* expression using the five UAS element
containing standard UAS-T vector is lethal in combination with
most Gal4 drivers [73]. As reported previously [74], driving UAS-
dNf1 ubiquitously with Act5C-Gal4, or broadly in neurons with elav-
Gal4, Ras2-Gal4, c23-Gal4, or 386Y-Gal4 restored dNf1 pupal size,
whereas driving the same transgene with more restricted neuronal
or non-neuronal drivers had no effect (Figure 8D and Table 3). By
contrast, driving the expression of UAS-dncRNAi or attenuated UAS-
PKA* transgenes with the same set of broadly expressed neuronal
drivers was ineffective (Tables 3 and S5). We note that expression
of the 26UAS-PKA* and 36-UAS-PKA* transgenes was generally
well tolerated, whereas the 46UAS-PKA* and the 56UAS-PKA*
transgenes exhibited increasing levels of lethality (Tables 3 and
S5). Arguing that rescue of the dNf1 growth defect by manipulating
cAMP/PKA signaling or dNf1 expression involves different cells,
strong pupal size rescue was observed by increasing cAMP/PKA
signaling in adipokinetic hormone-producing cells at the base of
the neuroendocrine ring gland using the Akh-Gal4 driver
(Figure 8D). Rescue was also observed with the Feb36-Gal4 and
Aug21-Gal4 ring gland drivers (Figure 8D), which give rise to
expression in the corpora allata, the source of juvenile hormone,

Drosophila Nf1 Growth Defect Modifiers

but not with the P0206-Gal4 or Mai60-Gal4 drivers, which express
predominantly in the prothoracic gland (Table 3). The tissue
specificity of all Gal4 drivers used in this and other experiments
was verified by microscopic observation of dissected UAS-GFP
expressing larvae (Table S4 and Figures 8E–H and S5).

dAlk, Jeb, Cnk and CCKLR-17D1 Suppress a dNf1 NMJ
Architectural Defect

During larval development, significant expansion of the NMJ
arbor must occur, reflecting the steady muscle growth that takes
place during larval life. As the NMJ grows, additional branches
and boutons are added to the initial synaptic arbor that forms
during late embryonic stages upon motor axon contact with its
target muscle. As a result, at the wandering third instar stage,
wild-type NMJs contain a highly stereotyped, segment specific
number of synaptic boutons [75]. Recently, it was reported that
dNf1 functions presynaptically to constrain NMJ synaptic growth
and neurotransmission [16]. In dNf1 null mutant wandering
third instar larvae, while the distribution of major presynaptic
proteins is unaffected, increased overall size and synaptic bouton
number is apparent at multiple NMJs, supporting a specific role
for dNf1 in restricting NMJ expansion [16]. Several dNf1
suppressors that emerged in the current screen have also been
linked to synapse morphogenesis,
including CCKLR-17D1,
which functions as a promoter of NMJ growth [36]. As our
screen identified CCKLR-17D1 as a dominant dNf1 size defect
suppressor, we wanted to confirm the dNf1 NMJ phenotype and
test whether CCKLR-17D1 and other suppressors affected this
defect.

By quantifying bouton number at the NMJ on muscles 6 and 7,
we confirmed that dNf1 mutants have a significant increase in
mean bouton number (Figure 9A and B). In addition, this analysis
confirmed previously published phenotypes for dAlk,
jeb and
CCKLR-17D1 [36,76]. Importantly, the dNf1 synaptic overgrowth
phenotype is dominantly suppressed by CCKLR-17D1, dAlk, jeb,
and cnk alleles (Figure 9B), arguing that all four genes are epistatic
to dNf1. As a control we analyzed an allele of spitz (spi), which
encodes an EGF-like growth factor and is uncovered by
suppressing Df(2L)Exel8041. However,
shows no genetic
interaction with dNf1, as loss of spi modified neither the pupal
size nor the NMJ overgrowth phenotypes (Figure 9B and data not
shown).

Human ALK Is Expressed in Schwann Cells and May Serve
as a Therapeutic Target in NF1

The identification of dAlk as a suppressor of all hitherto analyzed
dNf1 defects prompted us
to explore whether human ALK
represents a therapeutic target in NF1. Given our hypothesis that
NF1 negatively regulates ALK stimulated Ras/ERK signaling, in
order to play such a role, ALK and NF1 must be co-expressed in
cells that give rise to symptoms. We previously found that dNf1 and
dAlk expression overlaps extensively in Drosophila larval and adult
CNS [15], and the expression of orthologs of both genes also
overlaps in the murine CNS [77,78]. While overlapping CNS
expression is compatible with a role for ALK in NF1-associated
cognitive dysfunction, a causative role in another hallmark NF1
symptom, peripheral nerve-associated tumors,
is less obvious.
Among the near universal symptoms on NF1, benign neurofibro-
mas consist of Schwann cells, perineurial fibroblasts, infiltrating
mast cells, and nerve elements, with the Schwann cells sustaining
the second NF1 hit [79]. To test whether increased ALK signaling
in the absence of NF1 might play a role in the development of
neurofibromas, we used reverse transcription/PCR to detect the

alleles, and both of which are highly sensitive to pharmacological
ALK inhibition [80]. Compatible with a role for NF1 as a negative
regulator of mitogenic ALK/RAS signals, qRT-PCR verified NF1
knockdown with two shRNA retroviral vectors increased the
resistance of both lines to ALK inhibitors NVP-TAE684 and
Crizotinib (Figures 10A, 10C and S7). Compatible with a model in
which NF1 negatively regulates ALK/RAS signaling, NF1 knock-
down resulted in elevated ERK and AKT activation (Figures 10B).
Moreover, expression of activated KRAS, BRAF, or MEK transgenes,
but not of other Ras effector transgenes, in SH-SY5Y cells conferred
similar resistance to ALK inhibition (Figure S8).

Discussion

The work reported here was motivated by the fact that human
NF1 is a characteristically variable disease, the severity of which is
controlled at least in part by symptom-specific modifier genes [81].
Thus, a genetic analysis in Drosophila might not only reveal
molecular pathways controlled by the highly conserved (50%
identical) dNf1 protein, but also provide clues to the identity of
human modifiers, which by virtue of their rate-limiting roles in
symptom development might serve as therapeutic targets. The
current work was also motivated by the fact that, for reasons that
remain poorly understood, most dNf1 null mutant phenotypes are
rescued by increasing, or phenocopied by decreasing, cAMP/PKA

signaling. The identification of genetic modifiers of a cAMP/PKA
sensitive defect might reveal how loss of dNf1 affects cAMP/PKA
signaling, and help to resolve the long-standing controversy as to
whether dNf1 affects cAMP/PKA signaling directly, independent
of its role as a Ras regulator [10,27], or indirectly, secondary to a
Ras signaling defect [5,15].

the selection of

While recognizing that none of the thus far identified dNf1
phenotypes are ideally suited for use in modifier screens, we
selected the pupal size defect as the phenotype to analyze in our
screen for three main reasons. First, pupariation occurs at the end
of the larval growth period, and pupal size is readily assessed by
inspecting pupae attached to the side of culture vials, making this
phenotype amenable to a large-scale screen. Second, the growth
defect is among several cAMP/PKA sensitive dNf1 phenotypes.
Finally, reduced growth is also a symptom of human NF1 and
other RASopathies [1,82]. However, while compelling reasons
support
this phenotype, confounding factors
include that Drosophila size is a sexually dimorphic phenotype
affected by population density, feeding, environmental conditions
such as temperature, and genetic background differences. More-
over, while heterozygous dNf1 mutants are marginally smaller than
wild-type pupae [5], the more robust size phenotype (,15%
reduction in linear dimensions, ,25% reduction in weight) used in
our screen is only observed upon homozygous loss of dNf1. Thus,
our screen was not designed to find modifiers that act on the dNf1
protein itself, like the recently identified SPRED proteins [83].
Finally, organism size is a function of growth rate and duration,
both of which are regulated by hormonal cascades that involve
cross-talk between the larval brain, the neuroendocrine ring gland,
the fat body and other tissues [19,84]. Thus, a screen for modifiers
of dNf1-regulated growth may uncover genes involved in various
aspects of systemic growth control.

Early attempts to identify dNf1 pupal size modifiers were
abandoned when .95% of large X-ray induced 2nd chromosome

(Suzanne Brill, Iswar Hariharan and A.B., unpublished). Both
aborted screens informed the current effort, which used precisely
defined small deficiencies, isogenic crossing schemes and exper-
imental protocols
that guarded against population density
differences. In total we analyzed 486 1st and 2nd chromosome
deficiencies that together uncover well over 80% of chromosome
1, 2L and 2R genes (Table 1). Among the screened deficiencies,
132 (27.2%) significantly modified dNf1 pupal size (p,0.01; two-
tailed Student’s t-test). While this is a large number, 20 deficiencies
were subsequently eliminated because they also affect wild-type
size. Several modifying deficiencies also uncover overlapping
genomic segments, further reducing the number of dNf1 modifying
loci

responsible genes, we prioritized genes uncovered by suppressing
deficiencies over those uncovered by enhancing ones, modifiers
uncovered by overlapping deficiencies over those uncovered by
single deletions, modifiers uncovered by small deficiencies over
those uncovered by larger ones and stronger modifiers over weaker
ones. We also limited ourselves to genes that function in the
nervous system, based on the consideration that dNf1 re-expression
in larval neurons is sufficient to suppress the growth defect [5].

to 76. During follow-up studies aimed at

We previously reported that dNf1 growth and learning defects
are phenocopied by increasing neuronal Jeb/dAlk/ERK signaling,
and suppressed by genetic or pharmacological attenuation of this
pathway [15]. Validating our screen, deficiencies that uncover jeb
and dAlk were identified as dominant dNf1 size defect suppressors.
Others recently reported that Jeb/dAlk signaling allows brain
growth to be spared at the expense of other tissues in nutrient
restricted Drosophila and identified a glial cell niche around
neuroblasts as the source of Jeb under these conditions [41].

However, Jeb involved in systemic growth appears of mainly
neuronal origin, as RNAi-mediated jeb knockdown in neurons
increased dNf1 pupal size, whereas only one of four tested glial
drivers produced partial rescue (Figure 5A).

The identification of cAMP/PKA pathway modifiers dnc,
PKA-C1 and tentatively PKA-R2 further validates our screen.
increased PKA activity doesn’t suppress dNf1
Arguing that
defects by attenuating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, hsp70-
PKA* transgene expression, using a daily heat shock regimen
that suppresses the dNf1 size defect [4], does not reduce the
elevated dNf1 larval brain phospho-ERK level, and neither does
Ras2-Gal4 driven neuronal UAS-PKA* expression (Figure 8D).
Providing further mechanistic clues, our results demonstrate that
dNf1 and cAMP/PKA both affect systemic growth non-cell-
autonomously, but not necessarily in the same cells. Thus, we
previously showed that only relatively broadly expressed
neuronal Gal4 drivers restored mutant growth when driving
UAS-dNf1, whereas multiple drivers expressed in specific subsets
of neurons, including several expressed in the ring gland, lacked
the ability to restore dNf1 growth [5]. By contrast, using UAS-
dncRNAi or a series of newly generated attenuated UAS-PKA*
transgenes that avoid the toxicity associated with high level PKA
expression [73], we now show that manipulating cAMP/PKA
signaling with broadly expressed neuronal Gal drivers does not
affect the dNf1 size phenotype, whereas the same transgenes
induced with three ring gland drivers did suppress. Intriguingly,
the most potent rescue was observed when UAS-dncRNAi or
attenuated UAS-PKA* transgenes were driven in AKH-producing
cells at the base of the ring gland, whereas weaker rescue was
also observed with two ring gland drivers that show overlapping
expression in the juvenile hormone producing corpora allata.
This suggests that the dNf1 growth deficiency involves a defect in
processes controlled by one or both of these neuroendocrine
hormones.

jeb, Mer, mir-8, Pi3K21B, Pten, Ptth, SNF1A, sNPF, step, Tor, ush and
yki; see Table S3 for details), only dAlk and jeb scored as dominant
dNf1 pupal size modifiers, whereas the remaining 16 genes were
uncovered by non-modifying deficiencies, or in the case of Ptth, by
two deficiencies that altered developmental timing (Table S2).
Further explaining this lack of overlap, the previously implicated
PI3 kinase regulator B4 act in a recessive manner and several of
the above listed genes function outside of the CNS. Our screen
excluded such genes, because dNf1 controls growth non-cell-
autonomously by regulating neuronal Ras [5]. As previously
noted, a special case is provided by insulin pathway components
chico and Pten, which affect growth antagonistically. Both genes
map within 5 kb of each other on the 2nd chromosome and are
uncovered by the same non-modifying deficiency.

Two newly identified dNf1 growth defect suppressors, Dap160
and CCKLR-17D1, affect synaptic architecture or functioning
[36,56,57]. Because dNf1 was recently reported to function
downstream of focal adhesion kinase to restrain NMJ synaptic
growth and neurotransmission [16], and because the cholecysto-
kinin receptor related CCKLR-17D1 drosulfakinin receptor stim-
ulates NMJ growth [36], we analyzed whether this and three Ras
signaling related dNf1 size defect suppressors also affected NMJ
architecture. Our results confirm that dNf1 mutants exhibit
loss of CCKLR-17D1
synaptic overgrowth, and show that
suppresses this defect. Importantly, loss of jeb, dAlk, or cnk similarly
suppresses both size and synaptic overgrowth defects, suggesting
that both phenotypes may be related.

remains

The results presented here further

support our previous
conclusion that excess neuronal
Jeb/dAlk/Ras/MEK/ERK
signaling is the root cause of the cAMP/PKA sensitive dNf1
systemic growth defect. What happens downstream of this primary
defect
less clear, although our demonstration that
increasing cAMP/PKA signaling in AKH-producing cells and
other parts of the neuroendocrine ring gland suppresses the size
defect provides an important new clue, not only about pathways
involved in the dNf1 growth defect, but also about the likely non-
cell-autonomous cause of similar growth defects of PKA-C1 or
dCreb2 mutants [85,86]. Other questions that remain to be fully
answered concern the role of the NMJ architectural defect in the
dNf1 growth deficiency and the role of Jeb/dAlk signaling in the
NMJ defect. We note in this respect that that C. elegans ALK
ortholog, T10H9.2, has been implicated in synapse formation [87],
and that recent work suggests a role for trans-synaptic Jeb/dAlk
signaling in the control of neurotransmission and synaptic
morphology [88]. However, while the dNf1 growth defect is due
to excess dAlk signaling in neurons, NMJ synapse formation has
been suggested to involve the release of presynaptic Jeb activating
postsynaptic dAlk [88]. Further work will have to establish
whether the suppression of the dNf1 NMJ overgrowth phenotype
by jeb, dAlk and cnk involves cell autonomous roles for these genes
at synapses, or non-cell-autonomous functions elsewhere in the
CNS. Further work is also required to reveal
the functional
significance and the sites of action of other novel modifiers
identified in our screen.

From a clinical perspective, perhaps the most relevant questions
raised by our work are whether NF1 regulated ALK/RAS/ERK
signaling is evolutionarily conserved and whether excessive ALK/
RAS/ERK signaling contributes to human NF1 symptoms. Much
indirect evidence hints at a positive answer to both questions. First,
the expression of ALK and NF1 largely overlaps in the murine
nervous system [77,78], same as it does in Drosophila [15].
Second, ALK functions as an oncogene and NF1 as a tumor
suppressor in neuroblastoma [89–94]. Third, midkine, a ligand
is produced by NF12/2
that activates mammalian ALK [95],

As might be expected of a screen that used systemic growth as a
read-out, our work identified a diverse set of potential modifiers.
Notably, however, among a non-exhaustive set of 18 1st or 2nd
chromosome genes implicated in various aspects of Drosophila
body, organ, and/or cell size control (dAlk, B4, chico, hpo, Hr4, Ilp6,

Schwann cells, present at elevated levels in NF1 patient skin and
serum, and acts as a mitogen for NF1 tumor cell lines [96–98]. We
add to this evidence by showing that shRNA-mediated NF1
knockdown renders two oncogenic ALK-driven human neuro-
blastoma cell lines resistant to pharmacological ALK inhibition,
and by confirming that ALK mRNA is expressed in neurofibroma-
derived NF12/2 human Schwann cells. These findings make a
strong case that ALK should be explored as a therapeutic target in
NF1, and that loss of NF1 expression should be considered as a
potential mechanism in cases of acquired resistance to ALK
inhibition [99].

Materials and Methods

Fly Stocks and Experiments

The dNf1E1 and dNf1E2 alleles have been described [5].
Exelixis, DrosDel and BSC deficiencies were obtained from the
Bloomington Stock Center. Transgenic RNAi lines were obtained
from the Vienna Drosophila Research Center (VDRC) and the
TRiP Collection at Harvard Medical School. Eaat1SM1 and
Eaat1SM2 were provided by D. van Meyel, dALK8 and jebweli by R.
Palmer, cnkXE-385 and cnkE-2083 by M. Therrien, and carD146 by H.
Kramer, ppl06913 by M. Pankratz, hs-Ilp2 transgenic line by E.
Rulifson and UAS-Rab9 DN by R. Hiesinger. Flies were
maintained on agar-oatmeal-molasses medium at 25uC, unless
otherwise indicated.

To assess feeding, larvae at various stages of development were
placed on blue food dye-stained yeast paste, removed after 20 min,
washed and photographed. To analyze wandering behavior, 100
larvae (age 40–44 hr after egg deposition (AED)) were placed on
an agar plate with a central blob of yeast paste, and their position
after 24 hr was documented. To assess
the expression of
starvation-sensitive genes,
larvae at 72 h AED were placed in
vials with water for 16 hr, after which RNA was prepared and
subjected to blot analysis. To determine developmental timing, L1
larvae were collected 24 hr AED using a 2 hr egg collection and
reared at 140 animals per vial. The number of
larvae that
pupariated was scored at hourly intervals. To determine the larval
weight, L1 larvae were collected 24 hr AED using a 2 hr egg
collection. Larvae were reared at 140 larvae per vial and groups of
10 larvae were weighed at 8 hr intervals. Longevity was assessed
by maintaining adult flies under standard conditions and counting
the number of dead flies at regular intervals. In each of these
assays, genotypes were tested in duplicate. To induce hs-Ilp2
transgene expression, culture vials were placed in a circulating
water bath at 37uC for 10 min once or twice a day with an 8 hr
interval.

Insulin-Like Protein mRNA Quantification

The 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System from Applied Biosys-
tems was used to determine Ilp mRNA levels in RNA prepared
from dissected larval brains or from whole wandering stage 3rd
instar larvae. Results were normalized to RpL32. The following
IIp2-Forward, GGCCAGCTCCACAGT-
primers were used:
GAAGT,Ilp2-Reverse, TCGCTGTCGGCACCGGGCAT, Ilp3-

Genetic Screening, Validation, and Statistical Analysis

The crossing schemes in Figure 2 were used to generate dNf1E2
mutants carrying 1st and 2nd chromosome deficiencies. To avoid
crowding, cultures were maintained at 100–200 pupae per culture
vial. Initial scoring used calipers set at the length of dNf1 female
pupae, ignoring dNf1 heterozygotes recognizable by the presence
of the TM6B balancer. Next, the length of
individual pupae
carrying candidate modifying deficiencies was measured by
determining their head-to-tail
length using a microscope fitted
with NIS-Elements AR 3.0 imaging software. Measured pupae
were then placed in 96-well plates (Falcon) to determine their
gender and, if necessary, the genotype of eclosed flies. At least 40
pupae were measured for each genotype, and only measurements
of female pupae were used to calculate mean values and standard
deviations. Statistical significance was assessed with a two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Throughout this report, single or double asterisks
denote p-values,0.05 or ,0.01 respectively.

To identify responsible modifiers we used specific alleles or
UAS-RNAi knockdown. Alleles and UAS-RNAi lines on the 1st and
2nd chromosomes were crossed into the dNf1E2 background. UAS-
RNAi lines on the 3rd chromosome were recombined with dNf1E2.
UAS-RNAi lines in the dNf1E2 background were crossed to Gal4
drivers in the same background. The few deficiencies that gave rise
to synthetic lethal interactions were backcrossed with dNf1E1 flies
to produce Df/+; dNf1E2/dNf1E1 progeny.

To test whether genetic suppression reflected the inadvertent
introduction of a wild-type dNf1 allele, we used fly DNA prepared
using DNAzol (Molecular Research Inc.) in a PCR assay with
AGTCACATTAATTGATCCTG and GAGATCGTTGATA-
AAGAAGT primers. The second primer introduces a penultimate
single nucleotide change, which together with the E2 mutation
results in the introduction of an RsaI restriction site. RsaI digestion
of the PCR product gives rise to 370 and 61 bp fragments for the
wild-type allele, and 348, 61 and 22 bp fragments for the dNf1E2
allele. Digests were run on 8% acrylamide gels using both wild-
type (w1118) and dNf1E2 controls.

Construction of Akh-Gal4 and Attenuated UAS-PKA*
Transgenes

The Akh promoter region was amplified with Akh-FORWARD
and Akh-RE-
(AGATCTAATCTCCTGAATGCCGCAGCG)
VERSE (AGATCTATGCTGGTCCACTTCGATTC) primers.
The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of
a GAL4 coding region containing pCaSpeR derivative. The final
construct was sequenced to ensure correct orientation of the Akh
promoter before being used generate transgenic flies by standard
protocols.

To reduce the toxicity associated with high-level PKA
expression, we generated modified pUAS-T vectors containing
1, 2, 3 or 4, rather than 5 Gal4-binding sites. The primers used to
generate these vectors were: 16UAS-FOR: AACTGCAGAGCG-
26UAS-
GAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCGGAGACTCTAG;
FOR: AACTGCAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCGGAG-

TACTGTCCTCCGAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCG-
GAGTACTGTCCTCCG, and UAS-REV: CTAGAGGTAC-
CCTCGAGCGCGGCCGCAAGAT. An initial PCR was per-
formed using the 16UAS-FOR and UAS-REV primers with the
standard pUAS-T vector as a template. The resulting amplified
fragment was TA subcloned into pCR2.1 to make pCR2.1-
16UAS. The 26UAS-FOR and UAS-REV primers were then
used with pCR2.1-UAS(16) as a template to generate a UAS(26)

Immunofluorescence and Analysis of NMJ Morphology

Wandering third instar larvae were dissected in Ca2+

-free saline
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min at
room
temperature. Following fixation, larval pelts were washed three
times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then blocked for one
hour in PBT (PBS+0.1% Triton-X 100)+5% normal goat serum.
Larvae were incubated in primary antibody solution for three
hours at room temperature. Anti-HRP 568 (1:1000, Invitrogen)
was used to visualize neurons and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin
(1:500, Invitrogen) was used to visualize F-actin in the muscula-
ture. Images were collected using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-
disk confocal microscope with the Spectral Applied Research
(Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) Borealis modification on a Nikon
(Melville, NY) Ti-E inverted microscope using a 606 Plan Apo
(1.4 NA) objective. The microscope was equipped with a Prior
(Rockland, MA) Proscan II motorized stage. Larval samples were
excited with 488-nm (for phalloidin) and 561-nm (for HRP) 100-
mW solid-state lasers from a Spectral Applied Research LMM-5
laser merge module and was selected and controlled with an
tunable filter. Emission was collected with a
acousto-optical
Semrock (Rochester, NY) quad pass
(405/491/561/642 nm)
dichroic mirror and 525/50 nm (for phalloidin) and 620/60 nm
(for HRP) Chroma (Bellows Falls, VT) emission filters. Images
were acquired using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER-cooled CCD
camera. Hardware was controlled with MetaMorph (version 7.7.9)
software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA.). Five individual
animals were imaged for subsequent morphological analysis.
Motor nerve terminals of muscles 6 and 7 were imaged in
abdominal segments A2 and A3 and Z-stacks (0.25 mM between
images) and were captured from the top to bottom of each NMJ.
Morphological analysis of the NMJ was performed using NIH
Image J and was assessed by quantifying the number of synaptic
boutons per square micron. The number of synaptic boutons was
counted as previously described [16,101] and muscle area covered
by the NMJ was quantified by tracing a polygon connecting each
terminal branch point [102].

Human NF1 Experiments

The retroviral RNAi vectors

targeting human NF1 and
expression constructs of active alleles of RAS effectors were as
described previously [94]. Crizotinib (S1068) and NVP-TAE648
(S1108) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Antibody against
NF1 was
(A300-140A); antibodies
against pAKT(S473) and ATK1/2 were from Cell Signalling;
antibodies against p-ERK (E-4), ERK1 (C-16), ERK2 (C-14) and
CDK4 (C-22) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; A mixture of
ERK1 and ERK2 antibodies was used for detection of total ERK
from human cell lines. Antibody against mouse PKAa-cat (A-2)
SC-28315 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, b-Tubulin E7
from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank.

SH-SY5Y, Kelly and Phoenix cells were cultured in DMEM
with 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin and
streptomycin at 5% CO2. Subclones of each cell line expressing
the murine ecotropic receptor were generated and used for all
experiments shown. Phoenix cells were used to produce retroviral

nolan/retroviral_systems/phx.html.

To measure cell proliferation, single cell suspensions were
seeded into 6-well plates (1–26104 cells/well) and cultured both in
the absence and presence of ALK inhibitors. At the indicated
endpoints, cells were fixed,
stained with crystal violet and
photographed. All knockdown and overexpression experiments
were done by retroviral infection as described previously [103].

The 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System from Applied Biosys-
tems was used to determine mRNA levels. NF1 mRNA expression
levels were normalized to expression of GAPDH. The following
primers sequences were used in the SYBR Green master mix
(Roche): GAPDH-Forward, AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA;

Figure S2 PCR/RFLP assay for dNf1E2 mutation. (A) To make
sure that stocks with putative suppressing deficiencies preserved
the dNf1E2 C-.T nonsense transition, we used a PCR/Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism assay. The E2 mutation does not
create or destroy a restriction site. Rather, we used a reverse
primer with a penultimate A-.C transversion to amplify a 431
genomic fragment as indicated. The mutant primer creates a
GTAC RsaI restriction site when E2 genomic DNA is used as a
template. (B) RsaI digestion of PCR products gives rise to 370 and
61 bp fragments for the wild-type allele, and 348, 61 and 22 bp
fragments for dNf1E2. An example of the assay is shown with both
wild-type (w1118) and dNf1E2 controls (lanes 2, 3 and 4) and various
deficiencies (Df) either in wild-type (Df/CyO; +; lanes 5 and 15),
dNf1 homozygous (Df/CyO; dNf1E2; lanes 6–13) or heterozygous
(Df/CyO; dNf1E2/+; lanes 14 and 16) backgrounds.

Figure S4 The Ret tyrosine kinase is not involved in dNf1 growth
control. (A) Reagents generated to analyze the involvement of Ret
include Ret-Gal4 transgenic lines made by inserting a 957-bp
genomic segment representing the Ret promoter region into the
pChs-Gal4 vector. Other reagents include UAS-Ret
transgenes

mutations made by site-directed mutagenesis. (B) Ret-Gal4 driven

constitutively active C695R mutation produces a rough eye
phenotype as previously reported [60]. (D) Ret-Gal4 driven UAS-
dNf1 re-expression, RNAi-mediated Ret inhibition or expression of a
UAS-Ret kinase dead transgene, all failed to modify dNf1 pupal size.
Moreover, Ret-Gal4 driven expression of UAS-Ret with constitutively
active C695R mutation failed to phenocopy the dNf1 size defect. By
contrast, a small pupal size phenocopy was observed when Ret
C695R was driven ectopically with Ras2- and elav-Gal4,
likely
reflecting Ret-mediated activation of Ras/ERK signaling.

ed for the reasons indicated. Deficiencies that failed to produce
screening stocks are labeled ‘Impossible’. Unhealthy (sick)
deficiencies or those that uncovered Minute mutations were also
excluded.
(PDF)

Table S2 dNf1 modifier deficiency screen results. All deficiencies
analyzed are listed according to their relative chromosomal
position. The cytological location, molecular coordinates and the
dominant effect on dNf1 pupal size (NO – no interaction, SUP -
suppressor, ENH - enhancer) of each deficiency is given. Female
pupal length measurements for deficiencies in the dNf1 mutant
background are provided, together with standard deviations and p-
values. Modifying deficiencies that were subsequently found to
have an effect on wild-type pupal size are indicated (Yes –
indicates that a deficiency has a non-specific effect; No – no
observed effect on wild-type size; No* - has an effect on wild-type
size, but in the opposite direction from the effect on dNf1 mutants).
Where determined, the responsible gene identified under each
modifying deficiency is shown. The final column contains notes
such as deficiencies that result in altered developmental timing.
