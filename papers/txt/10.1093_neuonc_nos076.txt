signiﬁcant differences in the pattern of indications cited
among the institutions. Eighty-eight subjects and 168
eyes were evaluable for VA outcome. At completion of
chemotherapy, VA improved (32% of
subjects),
remained stable (40%), or declined (28%). Tumor loca-
tion was the most consistent prognostic factor for poor
VA outcome. There was poor correlation between radio-
graphic and VA outcomes. Although visual outcomes for
NF1-associated OPG are not optimal, approximately
one-third of children regain some vision with treatment.
Since radiographic outcomes do not predict visual out-
comes, their use as the primary measure of treatment
success is in question. The lack of consensus regarding
the indications for treatment underlines the need for
better standardization of care. Future clinical trials for
OPG require standardized visual assessment methods
and clear deﬁnitions of visual outcomes.

Keywords: neuroﬁbromatosis, optic glioma, outcomes,

Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) arise in 15% –

20% of children with the common, autosomal-
dominant, cancer-predisposition syndrome of
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1).1 The majority of these
tumors are diagnosed prior to the age of 6 years,
although symptomatic tumors have been reported in
older children.2 No more than half of NF1-associated
OPG patients will develop vision loss. Therefore,
initial management typically involves close observation.
When therapy is indicated, chemotherapy is usually the
treatment of choice.

Some clinicians advocate treatment when there is
radiographic progression or visual deterioration.1,3,4 By
contrast, others reserve treatment for only patients with
documented visual deterioration.
In addition, often
factored into the decision to treat are tumor size/extent,
tumor enhancement, tumor location, progressive proptosis,
visual ﬁeld loss, optic pallor, hydrocephalus, endocrine dys-
function, and the presence of diencephalic syndrome.1,5 – 7
A paucity of data exist regarding the clinical outcome of
children with OPG who receive chemotherapy. Much of
the published literature on the
chemotherapeutic
response of NF1-OPG has focused on radiographic out-
comes and not on changes in vision.8,9 Those studies that
include visual outcomes in their analyses are hampered
by small sample sizes, an admixture of patients with
NF1-associated and sporadic OPG, inclusion of subjects
previously treated with radiation, a lack of within-subjects
comparison,
inconsistent endpoints for follow-up, or
reporting of outcomes at the end of all treatments (which
often include 2 or more different therapies), making it
difﬁcult to draw clear conclusions regarding the efﬁcacy
of chemotherapy for NF1-OPG.4,10 – 13 Moreover,
in
many of these studies, the criteria for a change in vision
are often not well deﬁned.14 – 18 In addition, there are
multiple case reports/series in which the radiographic
and ophthalmologic outcomes do not match.5,11,13

For these reasons, we launched a large retrospective
multicenter study to evaluate visual outcomes following
frontline chemotherapy for NF1-associated OPG, to

Patients and Methods

This retrospective multicenter review was approved by
the ethics committees of all 10 participating sites
(Children’s Hospital Boston, MA; Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia, PA; Children’s Memorial Hospital,
Chicago,
IL; Children’s National Medical Center,
Washington DC; Cincinnati [OH] Children’s Hospital
Medical Center; Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital,
Royal Marsden Hospital, London; St Louis [MO]
Children’s Hospital; The Children’s Hospital at
Westmead, Sydney, Australia; The Hospital for Sick
Children, Toronto, ON; University of Utah, Salt Lake
City); consent was waived. The study population con-
sisted of children younger than 18 years of age with a
diagnosis of NF1 who had undergone initial treatment
with chemotherapy for an OPG. Subjects must have
started chemotherapy no earlier than January 1997
and completed or failed treatment before December
31, 2007. Of note, subjects whose initial chemotherapy
regimen changed because of carboplatin allergy or other
toxicity were not considered to have failed or completed
initial therapy; completion of therapy for these patients
was deﬁned as the end of treatment with the new
regimen. Subjects who had been treated previously
with radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded.

Potential cases were identiﬁed from existing clinical
databases (oncology, ophthalmology, neurology, and/or
NF clinic) at each site. Charts of eligible subjects were
abstracted for demographic and clinical
information,
including date of birth and diagnosis of OPG, familial in-
heritance or sporadic occurrence of NF1, reason for initial
imaging, tumor location at the start of therapy, indications
for starting treatment (both the primary [ie, main reasons]
and secondary indications), treatment regimen, and treat-
ment dates. Recorded were visual acuity (VA) and testing
method (Teller, Lea, HOTV, Snellen) within (cid:2)3 months
of the start and end of treatment and other pertinent
ophthalmologic outcomes (visual ﬁelds, optic disc pallor
or swelling, proptosis, nystagmus, and ocular alignment).
VA response was determined by the coordinating study
neuro-ophthalmologist (G.T.L.) after review of the data
from each site, taking into account the testing method
and acuity norms for age. A 2-line (eg, Snellen chart)
decrease in VA compared with the prechemotherapy
examination was deﬁned as worsening. Similarly, im-
provement was deﬁned as a 2-line increase in acuity. For
per-subject outcomes, if one eye worsened, the outcome
was deﬁned as worsening, no matter the outcome of the
other eye. If one eye improved and the other remained
stable, the per-subject outcome was scored as improved.
In addition, to evaluate radiographic response, a neu-
roradiologist at 8 of the sites compared the immediate
postchemotherapy MRI scans with the prechemother-
apy scans; central
the scans was not
performed. The size of the tumor was assessed using
the product of the largest 2 perpendicular diameters on

imaging. Changes in the intensity of post– gadolinium
contrast enhancement were recorded but not used as a
parameter to judge response. Radiographic response
was deﬁned as follows: complete response (CR) ¼ com-
response
plete disappearance of
(PR) ¼ reduction in size of the solid parts of the tumor
by more than 50%; minor response (MR) ¼ reduction
in size of the solid parts of the tumor between 50%
and 25%; stable disease (SD) ¼ reduction of the size
of the solid parts of the tumor of less than 25%, no
change in tumor size, or tumor progression of no more
than 25% and no appearance of new tumor lesions; pro-
gressive disease (PD) ¼ enlargement of the primary
tumor by greater than 25% or the appearance of new
lesions. Tumor location was characterized by the most
posteriorly involved structure of the visual pathway.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses and calculations were performed using Stata 11
(StataCorp). Univariate analyses to determine the rela-
tion of tumor location, age at treatment, gender, NF1
type, chemotherapy regimen, optic pallor or edema at
diagnosis, or radiographic outcome to visual outcome
(as a categorical variable) were performed using
Fisher’s exact tests (analyses of proportions for 2 × 2,
3 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 2 tables). Age was divided for ana-
lysis into 3 groups (,2 y, 2– 5 y, .5 y), as most prior
studies evaluating age as a risk factor for progression fol-
lowing treatment used 2 or 5 years as the cutoff.8,19 – 21
Logistic regression models, with age categories as indica-
tor variables, were used to examine the association
between visual outcome and potential predictors, in-
cluding tumor location and optic disc pallor, accounting
simultaneously for age. Analyses were performed on a
per subject or per eye basis as appropriate. Type I
error for signiﬁcance was set at P , .05.

Results

Demographics

One hundred ﬁfteen subjects who met eligibility criteria
were identiﬁed from 10 institutions with large, estab-
lished, NF clinical programs. The clinical characteristics
of
the study population are detailed in Table 1.
Approximately half of the subjects had tumor involve-
ment of the optic tracts or radiations. Of note, all of
these subjects also had involvement of
the optic
chiasm, and all but 3 had optic nerve involvement.
When the chiasm was the most posteriorly involved
structure, the nerve was always affected.

The median age at OPG diagnosis was 2.66 years
(range, 0.36 – 15.8) (Fig. 1A). Indications for diagnostic
MRI included abnormal eye symptoms or examination
(44%),
in asymptomatic
patients (43%), headache with or without other symp-
toms (4%), evaluation of an orbital or head plexiform
neuroﬁbroma (3%), and various other
indications

(each ,2%). No subject was diagnosed because of pre-
cocious puberty. The median interval from diagnosis to
initiation of treatment was 133 days (range, 1 –2990)
(Fig. 1C). As expected, almost all of the subjects received
a carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimen, 79% on a
weekly schedule and 19% on a monthly schedule.

Indications for Treatment

Indications for treatment are listed in Table 2. VA loss
and tumor growth were the most frequently listed
reasons to initiate therapy, and these were cited together
as primary indications in 23 cases. For most subjects,
more than 1 primary factor drove the decision to treat
(median, 2; mean, 2.1; range, 1– 6). Only 29 subjects
commenced therapy for a single indication. There
appear to be differences in the pattern of indications
cited among the institutions (Table 3), with some sites
treating more often for VA decline (sites 1 –4), and
others more often for radiographic tumor progression
(sites 5– 7). Other sites (8– 10) had more of an equal
balance between these 2 most commonly cited treatment
indications. The differences among institutions also
extended to other frequently mentioned indications. Of
note, only 2 subjects were treated for visual ﬁeld loss
without VA loss, and only 3 of 28 subjects with abnor-
mal visual ﬁelds at the start of treatment had normal VA.

subjects and eyes reﬂects patients who had enucleation
of 1 eye and cases in which only binocular acuity or
quantitative data on one eye were provided. At the com-
pletion of chemotherapy, VA had improved in 32% of
subjects and 22% of eyes, remained stable in 40% of
subjects and 57% of eyes, and declined in 28% of sub-
jects and 21% of eyes (Table 4; Supplementary material,
Table S1). Of 74 subjects with outcome data on both
eyes, 44 (59%) had concordant acuity outcomes, and
only 2 had one eye improve and the other deteriorate.
On univariate analysis, tumor involvement of the
optic tracts/radiations (P ¼ .02 per subject, P ¼ .01
per eye) and optic pallor at the start of treatment
(P ¼ .005 per eye) were associated with worse VA
outcome. Age was also a prognostic factor for poor
acuity outcome (P ¼ .04 per subject, P ¼ .02 per eye);
children 2 to 5 years of age were less likely to have a
meaningful decline in acuity compared with subjects
younger than 2 or older than 5 years (Table 5). Not
only were subjects younger than 2 years at highest risk
for visual decline, they also were least likely to demon-
strate improvement in VA with treatment (P ¼ .07 per
subject, P ¼ .08 per eye). In fact, no subject in this age
group had improvement in VA. Gender, NF1 type
(familial versus
chemotherapy regimen

sporadic),

(weekly versus monthly carboplatin), optic edema at
the start of treatment, and radiographic outcome were
not risk factors for visual deterioration in either per
subject or per eye analyses.

Multivariate analysis (per subject), including age and
tumor location, revealed tumor involvement of the optic
tracts/radiations (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% conﬁdence
interval [CI], 1.1 – 8.3; P ¼ .032) as the only signiﬁcant
prognostic factor for worsening of VA; however, there
was a trend toward an association with age younger
than 2 years (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03 – 1.0; P ¼ .055)
or older than 5 years (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.12 –1.1;
P ¼ .085). In the per-eye analysis, tumor location (OR,
2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 – 6.7; P ¼ .035), optic pallor (OR,
2.8; 95% CI, 1.1 –7.5; P ¼ .034), and age .5 years
(OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14 – 0.94; P ¼ .038) were prog-
nostic factors, while age ,2 years was not signiﬁcant
(OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.07 – 1.7; P ¼ .186).

correlation is no better (29% with radiographic response
and 28% with SD have worsening of vision, P ¼ .28).
In addition, 33% (SD + MR) and 37% (SD only) of
those with stable disease had improvement in vision,
and 1 of 4 subjects had improvement in acuity despite
radiographic PD.

Other Visual Outcomes

Information on other visual parameters (Supplementary
material, Table S2) was not obtained or recorded in 11%
(optic pallor) to 48% (visual ﬁelds) of the subjects at the
start of treatment. Of note, by the end of therapy, the
degree of proptosis had improved in 55% of subjects
with proptosis prior to treatment. Visual ﬁelds worsened
(eg, progressed from a quadrantanopia to a hemianopia)
in 42%. The visual ﬁeld outcome mostly mirrored that
of VA (data not shown).

ment or stabilization of vision after treatment with

chemotherapy, VA worsened in 28% of subjects and
21% of eyes despite treatment. It is unknown whether
some of the visual worsening during therapy reﬂected
damage that had already occurred prior to treatment
as opposed to continued tumor progression. In this
regard, there are few studies in the literature speciﬁcally
designed to assess the utility of chemotherapy for vision
preservation. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed only 8
“high-quality” publications in the literature that exam-
ined the visual outcome of OPG treated with chemother-
apy.11 Only 1 of these studies was multi-institutional,
and the largest
included 57 subjects with visual
outcomes. Of the 174 subjects in the meta-analysis,
14.4% had improvement, 47.1% stability, and 38.5%
worsening of vision following chemotherapy. The ap-
plicability of the conclusions to clinical practice suffers
from the limitations of the studies reviewed, including
lack of a clear deﬁnition of visual response, lack of quan-
titative assessment of vision, or lack of within-subject
evaluation. In addition, the wide range of time points
chosen as endpoints for visual assessment, and the
grouping of both NF1-associated and sporadic OPGs
together, make it difﬁcult to identify risk factors for
visual outcome. In prior studies, NF1-OPGs were less
likely than sporadic OPGs to have associated visual
impairment at diagnosis and to exhibit radiographic
progression over time.22 – 24

initiated treatment within 41
2 months of OPG diagnosis,
our study population may differ from those of prior
studies in the duration of visual loss prior to therapy,
although this was not directly assessed. Thus, treating
patients with recent visual
loss prior to irreversible
damage might result in better functional outcomes. In
addition, we do not have a rate of VA improvement
for untreated NF1-OPG patients for comparison. It has
been reported in the literature that some patients with
NF1-OPG and VA loss improve spontaneously, and
this has been suggested as a reason to hesitate initiating
chemotherapy in patients with vision loss. Given the
rarity of this phenomenon,
impact on
the rate of improvement seen in our study is likely to
be minimal.

its potential

We identiﬁed several factors associated with poor
visual outcomes despite treatment. These include age
(,2 y or .5 y) and optic pallor at the time of treatment.
The former ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies
that reveal that young age is a poor prognostic factor
for tumor progression; however, the age of highest risk
is variably reported as less than 1, 2, or 5 years.10,19,25
In contrast, age .5 years was associated with worse
progression-free survival in the seminal publication on
the efﬁcacy of vincristine and carboplatin for the treat-
ment of newly diagnosed, progressive
low-grade
glioma.8 While the prognostic signiﬁcance of age disap-
pears in the per-subject multivariate analysis, there is a

trend toward an association. In addition, in the per-eye
evaluation, age .5 years remains prognostic. This dis-
crepancy may be a reﬂection of sample size and points
to the need for a larger prospective study to evaluate
the contribution of age to VA outcome.

The predictive value of optic pallor is difﬁcult to
determine, given that pallor often occurs in patients
with OPG and no visual deﬁcits. It is possible that
pallor is an indicator of preexisting damage and
heralds subsequent vision loss. It is also conceivable

been on radiographic tumor progression rather than
visual outcomes. Tumor involvement in the most poster-
ior portion (postchiasmatic) of the visual pathway has
been associated with a higher
likelihood of VA
loss,26,27 although not all studies support this conclu-
sion.28,29 In our univariate and multivariate analyses,
tumor involvement of the optic tracts/radiations was
signiﬁcantly associated with progressive visual
loss
despite chemotherapy. Hypothalamic involvement did
not confer a poor visual prognosis, consistent with its
anatomic location outside of the visual pathway.

Particularly striking is the poor correlation between
visual and radiographic outcomes. Utilizing a clear
deﬁnition of radiographic response, only 34% – 38% of
subjects (depending on whether those with MR are con-
sidered to be stable or improved) had concordant visual
and radiographic outcomes, while 7% –11% of subjects
had one outcome improved while the other was worse.
Several smaller series have noted similar disparate
results,5,13,30 although a clear objective deﬁnition of
radiographic response was not always reported in these
studies.5,13 Our ﬁndings call into question the traditional
oncology method of deﬁning response simply in terms of
changes in tumor size rather than incorporating func-
tional outcomes. It is possible that our results are
affected by the inherent difﬁculty of measuring OPG
size reliably in NF1 patients, who often have concurrent
non-neoplastic areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted
MRI sequences (formerly referred to as unidentiﬁed
bright objects). This seems unlikely given our use of
standardized oncology criteria to deﬁne tumor response
and progression (minimum 25% change) and review
of
the MRI scans by a neuroradiologist at each
participating site.

There appears to be little consensus regarding the
indications for treatment in our study, despite the
involvement of high-volume NF clinical centers with
large patient populations. Although VA loss and
tumor progression were the main reasons for treat-
ment, a combination of factors drove the responsible
physicians to treat in most cases. Whether these differ-
ences among centers are due to the weight that individ-
ual physicians place on certain factors, differences in
the referral patterns, or institutional practice biases,
they demonstrate the need for uniform criteria for
treatment.

The strengths of

For this cohort of NF1-OPGs that required treatment,
the need for treatment was apparent early, as the
median time from diagnosis of OPG to the initiation of
treatment in our cohort was less than 41
2 months. Since
more than 65% of subjects initiated treatment within 1
year of diagnosis and approximately 85% within 3
years, we advocate that patients with newly diagnosed
NF1-OPGs undergo neuro-ophthalmology and neuro-
oncology evaluation every 3 months for the ﬁrst year,
every 6 months for the next 2 years, and yearly
thereafter. The identiﬁcation of late presentations of
symptomatic OPG suggests
that continued yearly
evaluations for up to 8 years after OPG diagnosis may
be warranted. The optimal frequency of neuro-imaging
follow-up has yet to be determined.
the present

study include its
large sample size, involvement of centers with clinical
expertise in the treatment of children with NF1,
uniform population of NF1-associated OPGs, standar-
dized assessment time points, and quantitative, clearly
deﬁned visual outcomes that were applied consistently
across all centers. However, given that our outcome
assessments were performed at
the completion of
therapy, no comment can be made on the durability of
visual response. Our study had a higher percentage
of subjects younger than 2 years old who were inevalu-
able for VA outcome because of a lack of quantitative
data, highlighting the difﬁculty in obtaining reliable
vision examinations in very young children and the
need to explore potential surrogate markers for acuity,
such as optical coherence tomography.31 In addition, ad-
equate data on most of the ancillary visual outcomes
(visual ﬁelds, ocular alignment, etc) were lacking. This
deﬁciency underscores the challenge inherent in retro-
spective evaluations of visual parameters that are not
traditionally reported in a quantitative fashion.

In summary, our multicenter study identiﬁed several
important ﬁndings with clear clinical importance. First,
although visual outcomes after treatment with chemo-
therapy for NF1-OPG are not optimal, there are children
who regain vision with treatment. Second, tumor in-
volvement of the optic tracts/radiations is the most con-
sistent prognostic factor for poor visual outcome. Third,
the lack of correlation between visual and radiographic
outcomes argues against the use of MRI response as

the gold standard of treatment success for this tumor.
Fourth, the lack of agreement on indications for treat-
ment of OPG among the large centers participating in
this study highlights the need for better standardization
of the care of these patients. Fifth, the short interval
from diagnosis to initiation of treatment in the majority
of NF1-OPGs has implications for the intensity of
follow-up. These observations provide the key questions
that can only be adequately addressed with a prospective
collaborative study involving neuro-oncologists and
neuro-ophthalmologists, which would employ standar-
dized visual assessment methods and clear deﬁnitions
of visual outcomes and data acquisition time points.
