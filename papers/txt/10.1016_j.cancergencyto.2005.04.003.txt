Abstract

The molecular basis of tumorigenesis and tumor progression in meningiomas is not fully
understood. The neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2)
locus is inactivated in 50–60% of sporadic
meningiomas, but the genetic basis of sporadic meningiomas not inactivated at the NF2 locus
remains unclear. Speciﬁcally, there is conﬂicting data regarding the role of the tumor suppressor
gene DAL-1/4.1B. Using microsatellite markers, we studied 63 sporadic meningiomas to determine
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF2 and DAL-1/4.1B loci. Array comparative genomic
hybridization analysis of 52 of these tumors was performed to determine copy number changes on
chromosomes 18 and 22. Forty-one of 62 informative tumors showed LOH at the NF2 locus (66%)
while only 12 of 62 informative tumors (19%) showed LOH of DAL-1/4.1B. Eleven of 12 (92%)
tumors with DAL-1/4.1B LOH also had NF2 LOH. Monosomy or large deletions of chromo-
somes 18 and 22 were the main mechanism for LOH in these tumors. These studies implicate the
DAL-1/4.1B locus in sporadic meningiomas less commonly than reported previously, and suggest
that it is a progression rather than an initiation locus. Furthermore, we found the majority of
meningiomas developed monosomy rather than isodisomy at the NF2 and DAL-1/4.1B loci as the
mechanism for LOH. Ó 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

Meningiomas are common neoplasms of the brain and
spinal cord, accounting for 15–20% of all tumors of the
central nervous system. These tumors arise from the
leptomeninges and occur in three genetic contexts: as
sporadic tumors in genetically normal individuals, as part
of neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2), and in patients with
syndrome of multiple meningiomas, which may show
autosomal dominant inheritance. Meningiomas are usually
benign but malignant progression occasionally occurs.

The molecular origin of meningiomas has not been fully
explained yet. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromo-
some 22, including the NF2 region at 22q12, occurs in
approximately half of all sporadic meningiomas [1,2]. The

genetic basis of sporadic meningiomas not inactivated at
the NF2 locus remains unclear. Losses involving the short
arm of chromosome 1 have been described by LOH and
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in
approximately 30% of sporadic meningiomas but were
associated with inactivation of NF2 in the majority of the
tumors [3–8]. Other chromosome losses reported include
4q, 6q, 8q, 9p, 10q, 13q, 14q, 15q, 17p, 18, 19p, X, and Y,
as well as gains of 12q, 15q, and 18p [4,6,7]. Although
several chromosome arms have been implicated in
meningioma tumorigenesis by CGH and LOH analysis,
only a few genes have been analyzed individually,
including DAL-1/4.1B (EPB41L3), p18, TP53, PTEN,
KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, CDKN2A, P14ARF, CDKN2B, and
CDKN2C [2,9–11].

LOH of DAL-1/4.1B was originally reported in 71% (12/
17) of sporadic meningiomas [9], but LOH and mutational
analysis by exon scanning of multiple meningioma patients

136

F. Nunes et al. / Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics 162 (2005) 135–139

found that DAL-1/4.1B does not act as a tumor suppressor
gene in this very particular cohort of tumors [12]. To
reconcile these apparently conﬂicting results regarding
the role of DAL-1/4.1B in meningiomas, we analyzed the
DAL-1/4.1B and NF2 loci in 63 sporadic meningiomas
using LOH and CGH analysis, and correlated our ﬁndings
with tumor histopathologic subtype and grade.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples

the clinical

Sixty-three individuals undergoing clinically indicated
surgery for resection of dural-based tumors were entered in
this study. In all cases,
impression of the
treating physician was that the patient had a single tumor
without evidence of other intracranial neoplasms or NF2,
and the treating pathologist classiﬁed the tumor as
a meningioma. Excess tumor tissue that was unnecessary
for diagnosis was ﬂash-frozen on liquid nitrogen. Genomic
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood specimens or
tumor tissue, as described previously [12]. The Institutional
Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital approved
this study, and informed consent was obtained from all
study subjects.

2.2. LOH analysis

LOH of the NF2 region was determined at markers
CRYBB2 and D22S193 (centromeric to NF2), D22S929
(intragenic), and D22S268 and D22S430 (telomeric to
NF2). The distance from the most centromeric marker to
the most telomeric marker is approximately 5 megabases
(Mb). LOH of 18p was determined using markers
D18S1412, D18S1414, and D18S1415, which lie within
intron 1 of the DAL-1/4.1B gene, and D18S1416, which lies
within intron 3 [12]. The distance from the most
centromeric marker in intron 1 to the most
telomeric
marker
in intron 3 is 20 kilobases. To exclude the
possibility of partial gene deletion telomeric to intron 3,
marker D18S481 [9,13], which lies 2.4 Mb telomeric to the
3# end of DAL-1/4.1B, was used. The location of markers

on chromosomes 18 and 22 is shown in Fig. 1; ampliﬁca-
tion and analysis of microsatellite markers were performed
as described previously [12].

2.3. Array CGH

One microgram of tumor or normal genomic DNA (male
or female) was digested with DpnII (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA), puriﬁed with DNA Clean & Concentrator
(Zymo Research, Orange, CA), and labeled with Cy3-cCTP
or Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire,
UK) using the Bioprime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Labeled DNA was
precipitated using isopropanol with Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen
Life Technologies), which was used to block repetitive
sequences. The probe pellet was then washed with 70%
ethanol, dried, and dissolved in hybridization buffer.
Labeled probes were hybridized onto a human cDNA
microarray chip (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA),
which contains 12,814 clones. The slides were then air-
dried by centrifugation before imaging.
Images were
collected using an Axon 4000B scanner and processed
initially using GenePix Pro 4.1(Axon Instruments, Inc.,
Union City, CA). Defective spots were ﬂagged by visual
inspection of the images and a custom software was used to
exclude spots that demonstrated low signal-to-noise ratios
[14]. The software calculated the baseline CGH level (two
genomic copies) as the median Cy3 and Cy5 ratio of all
clones analyzed. The normalized values were transformed
to log2 format to ensure equal weighting for gains and
losses. The average log2 ratios for all target DNA from
chromosomes 22 and X were then calculated for each tumor
sample. The X chromosome provided an internal control for
large imbalances in the CGH analysis. The expected X
chromosome log2 ratios were 20.5 for male versus female
comparisons, 0 for sex-matched comparisons, and 10.5 for
female versus male comparisons. When X chromosome
values differed from the expected ratio by more than 20%
(log2 O 0.11), X chromosome CGH data was reviewed to
look for whole or partial X chromosome loss or gain. Copy
number changes in chromosome X occurred in six samples

Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

(12%), and for these, normalization to the average X log2
value was omitted, and log2 ratios were normalized to the
median log2 ratio observed for all target clones from the
entire genome. When X chromosome losses or gains were
not detected,
the log2 ratios for chromosome 22 were
adjusted according to the expected X chromosome value.

2.4. Histopathology

Hematoxylin and eosin–stained,

formalin-ﬁxed, and
parafﬁn-embedded sections of the tumors were evaluated
histologically by a neuropathologist (A.S.R.), who was
blinded for the genetic analysis results. Tumors were
graded as benign, atypical, or malignant meningiomas on
the basis of World Health Organization criteria [15] and
classiﬁed into histologic subtypes (Fig. 2). When malignant
features were present in the tumors, subtype classiﬁcation
was based on the better-differentiated areas in which the
histologic subtype pattern was best preserved.

3. Results and discussion

Sixty-two of 63 tumor blood pairs

studied were
informative at one or more DAL-1/4.1B markers. Fifty of
these tumors showed retention of both alleles in the tumor,
while 12 showed LOH in the tumor compared to the blood
specimen (19%). LOH of DAL-1/4.1B was more common
among malignant (seen in 3 of 5 tumors, 60%) and least
common among benign meningiomas (1 of 31, 3.2%).
Whenever more than one marker was informative, all were
either lost or retained, indicating a lack of breakpoints
within the small region studied, including marker D18S481.
Sixty-two tumor–blood pairs studied were informative at
the NF2 locus for one or more markers. Twenty-one tumors
showed retention of both alleles, while 41 tumors showed
LOH in the tumor compared to the blood specimen (66%).
Sixty-one tumors were informative for at least one marker
at each locus. Of the 12 tumors with DAL-1/4.1B LOH, 11

(92%) also showed NF2 loss, while a single tumor had
LOH of DAL-1/4.1B and retained heterozygosity at the NF2
locus.

Conﬂicting results have been reported in the literature
regarding the involvement of DAL-1/4.1B in meningioma
formation. Multiple studies involving non-small cell lung
carcinomas, sporadic meningiomas, and multiple meningi-
omas have failed to identify inactivating mutations in the
gene sequence. Methylation of the promoter region has
been proposed as an explanation for the decreased protein
expression found in tumor tissues without detectable gene
mutations [9,12,16]. So far, the presence of LOH in tumors
has been the only conﬁrmed inactivation event occurring in
this tumor suppressor gene, and additional studies corre-
lating LOH analysis with immunohistochemical and
methylation studies in a large cohort of tumors are needed
to determine DAL-1/4.1B involvement
in meningioma
formation [9,16].

In 52 of the 63 tumors, adequate-quality DNA was
available for array CGH analysis. Three groups of
chromosome segments were evident:
those with two
chromosome copies of
the segments examined (log2
CGH ratio from 20.09 to 10.09), those with a single copy
of the locus tested (log2 CGH ratio !20.2), and those with
ampliﬁcation of the segments tested (log2 ratio O10.2).
Single copies of all chromosome 18 segments, consistent
with monosomy, were seen in six of the eight tumors tested
by CGH and showing DAL-1/4.1B LOH. One tumor with
DAL-1/4.1B LOH and retention of the NF2 locus showed
two copies of DAL-1/4.1B and its surrounding region
by CGH examination, consistent with isodisomy of the
DAL-1/4.1B locus as the apparent mechanism for LOH of
DAL-1/4.1B. One tumor showed gain on the short arm of
chromosome 18 (log2 CGH ratio 0.71) and loss of the long
arm. Forty-three of the remaining 44 tumors showing
retention at DAL-1/4.1B showed two copies of all 18p
segments surrounding DAL-1/4.1B. One single atypical
tumor had an increased copy number for chromosome 18
which involved the whole chromosome. A summary of the

LOH and CGH results from all tumors showing LOH of
chromosome 18 is presented in Table 1. Our ﬁndings agree
with previous reports of malignant progression of sporadic
meningiomas, which showed monosomy of chromosome
18 in three out of four atypical tumors, but large deletions
of 18q in only 2 out of 13 benign tumors [5]. Monosomy of
chromosome 18, determined by single copy of all
chromosome 18 segments by CGH analysis, occurred in
75% of the tumors with LOH of DAL-1/4.1B in contrast to
the LOH mechanism originally described in sporadic
meningiomas,
the eight
meningiomas informative at marker D18S452 (centromeric
to DAL-1/4.1B) were found to have LOH of 18p extending
beyond the DAL-1/4.1B region [9].

in which only three out of

Monosomy of chromosome 22 was seen in 8 out of 34
tumors showing NF2 LOH (23%). All
remaining 26
meningiomas showed decreased copy number of almost
all chromosome 22 segments, but had two copies of the
most centromeric 15-Mb region and ampliﬁcation of the
same region in a single tumor. Of the 18 tumors without
NF2 LOH, 11 showed 2 copies of all chromosome 22
segments. The remaining seven tumors showed ampliﬁca-
tion of the most centromeric region of chromosome 22,
similar to the ﬁndings in tumors with LOH of NF2. The
NF2 gene has been well documented as a tumor suppressor

Table 2

gene in 50–60% of sporadic meningiomas [17]. The
mechanism by which NF2 LOH occurs in meningiomas,
however, has not been fully described. Our results raise the
question of which other genes located on chromosomes 18
and 22 are also being inactivated by this LOH process.
Moreover, repetitive elements in the genome are common
causes of chromosomal recombination and can lead to
deletions, ampliﬁcations, or translocations. Palindromic
repetitive elements located at the centromeric region of
chromosome 22 have been shown to induce genomic
instability leading to the rearrangements [18,19]. In this
study, the most centromeric portion of chromosome 22 was
found to have two or more copies by CGH analysis in 26
meningiomas with NF2 LOH and more than two copies in
seven meningiomas without NF2 LOH, suggesting that the
existence of similar clones located elsewhere in the human
genome might be interfering in the analysis of copy
numbers of this centromeric region of chromosome 22. It is
unclear so far if these repetitive elements inﬂuence in the
mechanism of chromosome 22 LOH in meningiomas, or
whether they represent an artifact of CGH analysis.

Of

the 63 tumors studied,

the treating pathologist
classiﬁed 32 as benign (51%), 26 as atypical (41%), and
ﬁve as malignant (8%). LOH of both loci was more
common among malignant tumors than among the atypical
and benign. Thirty-three tumors were available for
histolopathologic review, with seven tumors classiﬁed as
meningothelial (21%), 14 as transitional (43%), and 12 as
ﬁbroblastic (36%) by the reviewing pathologist. LOH at the
NF2 and DAL-1/4.1B loci are shown in Table 2. The
ﬁbroblastic subtype of meningiomas has been previously
correlated with NF2 gene inactivation [20,21]. Our studies
extend this view, with NF2 LOH most common in
ﬁbroblastic tumors of all grades and least common in
transitional tumors. Differences among subtypes were the
most prominent in benign tumors, suggesting either that
NF2 LOH occurs during progression or that meningothelial
and transitional tumors with NF2 LOH are most likely to
progress. In addition, histologic subtype is at least in part
a surrogate for tumor localization [22], which could not be
addressed in the current study.

Our analysis has shown that LOH of 18p is not as
common in sporadic meningiomas as previously reported,
acting more as a progression event than an early event in
meningiomas formation. We have also demonstrated that
