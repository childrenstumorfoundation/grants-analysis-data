ABSTRACT

Neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to all the major cell types in the brain, including neurons, oli-
godendrocytes, and astrocytes. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that govern brain
NSC proliferation and differentiation have been incompletely characterized to date. Since some
neurodevelopmental brain disorders (Costello syndrome and Noonan syndrome) are caused by
germline activating mutations in the RAS genes, Ras small GTPases are likely critical regulators
of brain NSC function. In the mammalian brain, Ras exists as three distinct molecules (H-Ras, K-
Ras, and N-Ras), each with different subcellular localizations, downstream signaling effectors,
and biological effects. Leveraging a novel series of conditional-activated Ras molecule-
expressing genetically engineered mouse strains, we demonstrate that activated K-Ras, but not
H-Ras or N-Ras, expression increases brain NSC growth in a Raf-dependent, but Mek-
independent, manner. Moreover, we show that activated K-Ras regulation of brain NSC prolifer-
ation requires Raf binding and suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) function. Collectively, these
observations establish tissue-speciÔ¨Åc differences in activated Ras molecule regulation of brain
cell growth that operate through a noncanonical mechanism. STEM CELLS 2015;33:1998‚Äì2010

INTRODUCTION

Neural stem cells (NSCs)
renewing population found in neurogenic
regions of the embryonic and adult brain [1,
2].
In addition to forming new NSCs (self-
renewal and proliferation), these stem cells
can also give rise to all the major cell types in
the brain, including neurons, oligodendrocytes,
and astrocytes, through multilineage differen-
tiation [3‚Äì6]. Each of these cell fate decisions
requires the activation of signaling pathways
and transcriptional programs [3, 7‚Äì11]. In this
regard, numerous potential regulatory mecha-
nisms,
involving p53, Bmi1, sonic hedgehog,
Notch, p27, REST/NSRF, epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor, and others [12‚Äì23], have been
reported. While many of these signaling mole-
cules are responsible for NSC growth and dif-

reported in individuals affected with Costello
syndrome (OMIM 613224). Normally,
small
GTPase proteins,
like Ras, act as molecular
switches by alternating between active, GTP-
bound and inactive, GDP-bound states [28].
However,
in Costello and Noonan syndrome,
these germline mutations result in Ras pro-
teins, which are locked in the active GTP-
bound form,
leading to unchecked Ras path-
way hyperactivation.

Ras exists as three separate molecules (H-
Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras). Despite 85% amino
acid sequence similarity, the speciÔ¨Åc functions
of each Ras molecule are dictated by distinct
C-terminal 25-amino acid residues within the
unique hypervariable regions (HVRs). While
these HVRs contain CAAX-box motifs which are
isoprenylated to allow for Ras targeting to the
plasma membrane (PM) [29], differential pal-
mitoylation directs their trafÔ¨Åcking to the PM
via the Golgi (H-Ras, N-Ras) or other, unknown
mechanisms (K-Ras) [30, 31]. This differential
processing directs the Ras molecules to dis-
tinct domains within the PM [32], and is
thought to underlie their differential capacities
to signal to downstream effector proteins in
different cellular contexts [29, 33, 34].

Based on these potential differences, we hypothesized that
activated H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras expression, as observed in the
Noonan and Costello neurogenetic disorders, may differentially
regulate NSC growth and differentiation. Using a combination of
in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that controlled
expression of activated K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, increases
brain NSC proliferation without altering multilineage differentia-
tion. Moreover, activated K-Ras controls brain NSC growth in a
Raf-dependent, but Mek-independent manner, through binding
and inhibition of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) function.

pons) were acquired using a Leica DFC 3000G camera (Leica
Microsystems). Lineage antibody-positive cells were normal-
ized to the total tissue surface areas within the images, and
quantiÔ¨Åed using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluores-
cence software (Leica Microsystems).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mice

Activated H-Ras, K-Ras, or N-Ras allele expression were
induced in NSCs in vivo by intercrossing BLBP-Cre [35] mice
with mice containing Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-H-RasG12V (Supporting
Information Fig. S1; generated by Dr. Kevin Haigis), LSL-K-
RasG12D [36], or LSL-N-RasG12D [37] constructs knocked into
the respective Ras locus. All mice were maintained on a
C57Bl/6 background in accordance with approved animal
studies protocols at Washington University.

Immunohistochemistry

Brain tissues were collected at postnatal day 18 (PN18). Prior
to tissue harvesting, mice were intracardially perfused with
Ringer‚Äôs solution containing lidocaine and heparin followed by
4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were postÔ¨Åxed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde and then in 70% ethanol overnight before
embedding. ParafÔ¨Ån-embedded tissues were sectioned at 6
lm thickness using a Leica RM2125 RTS microtome (Leica
Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, www.leica-microsystems.
com). Antigen retrieval and appropriate primary antibodies
(Supporting Information Table S1) were applied overnight at 4
C in immunohistochemistry (IHC) diluent (1% milk, 2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), and 2% goat serum in tris-buffered saline
(TBS)-Tween). Tissues were then incubated with species-
appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, www.vectorlabs.
com) in IHC diluent. Photomicrographs of the pons (Supporting
Information Fig. S2) were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse E600
light microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY, www.
nikoninstruments.com) equipped with a Leica EC3 camera
(Leica Microsystems). Six to ten mice were collected per geno-
type along with appropriate matched littermate controls.

Immunofluorescence

Brain tissues were collected as described above. Following Ô¨Åx-
ation, the brains were dehydrated in 30% sucrose for 24
hours prior to embedding in OCT mounting media (Sakura
Finetek, Torrance, CA, www.sakura-americas.com) and freezing
at 280 C. Frozen tissues were cut into 10-lm-thick sections
on a Reichert-Jung Cryocut 1800 cryostat (Reichert Technolo-
gies, Depew, NY, www.reichert.com). Primary antibodies (Sup-
porting Information Table S1) were applied overnight at 4 C
in immunoÔ¨Çuorescence (IF) diluent (2% BSA, 2% goat serum
in TBS-Tween). Tissues were subsequently incubated with
species-appropriate AlexaFluor 488 or 568 secondary antibod-
ies (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, www.lifetechnologies.
com) in IF diluent. Nuclei were counterstained with 40,6-dia-

NSC Culture

NSCs were generated from PN1 brainstems, as previously
reported [38]. BrieÔ¨Çy, dissociated brainstem tissue was cul-
tured for 5 days in NSC-selective media supplemented with
1% N2 (Life Technologies), 2% B27 (Life Technologies), 20 ng/
ml Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor (FGF) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, www.sigmaaldrich.com), and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth
factor (EGF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, www.rndsys-
tems.com) in ultra-low attachment dishes (Corning, Corning,
NY, www.corning.com). Expression of activated H-Ras, K-Ras,
or N-Ras molecules was induced in NSCs following Ad5-Cre
(University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core, Iowa City, IA)
infection. Ad5-LacZ-infected NSCs served as controls. Ras
activity was quantiÔ¨Åed in 750‚Äì1,000 lg of NSC lysates using
commercially available Raf1-Ras binding domain (RBD) afÔ¨Ånity
chromatography assay kits according to the manufacturer‚Äôs
instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA, www.emdmillipore.com).
All NSC assays were performed on NSCs maintained in culture
for fewer than three passages.

NSC Growth

NSC growth was assessed by direct cell counting following the
seeding of 5,000 NSCs (in triplicate)
in 24-well ultra-low
attachment dishes (Corning) containing NSC media. Cells were
trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer after 5 days
in culture. Each experiment was repeated at least three times
using NSCs harvested from three independently generated lit-
ters. For the immunocytochemistry experiments, neurospheres
were collected after 5 days in culture, washed twice in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), and Ô¨Åxed for 30 minutes in 4% para-
formaldehyde. Neurospheres were then dehydrated in 30%
sucrose for at least 24 hours prior to embedding in OCT mount-
ing media (Sakura Finetek) and freezing at 280 C. All frozen
embedded neurospheres were cut into 10-lm-thick sections on
a Reichert-Jung Cryocut 1800 cryostat (Reichert Technologies,
Depew, NY). Primary antibodies (Supporting Information Table
S1) were applied overnight at 4 C in IF diluent. Tissues were
subsequently incubated with species-appropriate AlexaFluor 488
or 568 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) in IF diluent and
counterstained with DAPI. At least eight neurospheres of similar
diameter and cell number were imaged per sample and com-
pared to LacZ-infected control cells.

In Vitro NSC Differentiation

Differentiation was assessed by seeding 150,000 NSCs in tripli-
cate onto 24-well plates coated with 50 lg/ml poly(D-lysine)
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 lg/ml Ô¨Åbronectin (Life Technologies) in
NSC media supplemented with 1% N2, 2% B27, and 1% fetal
bovine serum. After 6 days in culture, adherent cells were
Ô¨Åxed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained

in PBS containing 2% goat

AlexaFluor 488 or 568 secondary antibodies (Life Technolo-
gies) in PBS with 2% goat serum and counterstained with
DAPI. For the EdU studies, 20 lM 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine
(EdU; Life Technologies) was added to the culture media 3
hours prior to Ô¨Åxation. EdU was detected using the Click-IT
EdU Assay Kit (Life Technologies) prior to immunocytochemis-
try staining according to manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. Each experi-
ment was repeated at least three times using NSCs harvested
from three independently generated litters.

software (TreeStar, Inc., Ashland, OR, www.Ô¨Çowjo.com).

in control NSCs were empirically determined by dose escala-
tion experiments (data not shown). Using these doses, NSCs
were treated with either 6.5 lM GGTI-286 (Millipore),
200 nM AZ628 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, www.selleck-
chem.com), 2 nM PD0325901 (Selleck Chemicals), 50 nM

cals), 20 lM SB203580 (Selleck Chemicals), or 5 lM RRD-251
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 days in culture. DMSO treatment served
as a vehicle control.

Dominant-Negative K-Ras Inhibition
Dominant-negative K-Ras (dnK-RasN17) in the MSCV retroviral
plasmid vector p5Ra-IRES-GFP [39] was used to generate virus
in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. MSCV-IRES-GFP served
as control virus. Successful infection was conÔ¨Årmed by green
Ô¨Çuorescent protein (GFP) expression in both control and dnK-
RasN17-infected NSCs (Fig. 6C, Supporting Information Fig. S5B).

Immunoprecipitation

Raf-1 immunoprecipitation was performed using whole cell
lysates in binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9),
40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA,
0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5% IGEPAL,
and 3 mg/ml BSA. Total protein (500 lg) in 400 ll of binding
buffer was precleared with 30 ll agarose protein G beads
(Cell Signaling) for 2 hours at 4 C on a rotor. After removing
the beads, lysates were incubated with Raf-1 monoclonal anti-
bodies (Millipore, Supporting Information Table S1) overnight
at 4 C on a rotor. Following the addition of agarose beads
for an additional 2 hours, the beads were washed three times
in 500 ll binding buffer, boiled in 20 ll 43 Laemmli buffer
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), and separated on 8% polyacrylamide
gels for Western blotting. Raf-1 pull-down was conÔ¨Årmed by
blotting with a different Raf-1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Sup-
porting Information Table S2).

NSCs were incubated in NSC media without B27, N2, EGF, and
FGF growth supplements for 2 hours prior to a brief PBS
wash and centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed in cold lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM EGTA, 40 mM b-
glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P40, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM
sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with aprotinin (1.4 lg/
leupeptin (1 lg/ml), and phenylmethanesulfonylÔ¨Çuoride
ml),
(1 mM) protease inhibitors for protein quantitation using the
Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA,
lysates (20 lg)
www.thermoÔ¨Åsher.com). The resulting cell
were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyviny-
lidene diÔ¨Çuoride membranes (Immobilon, Thermo Fisher).
Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 13 TBS-Tween
prior to overnight incubation at 4 C with appropriate primary
antibodies (Supporting Information Table S2). Detection was
achieved using species-appropriate HRP-linked secondary anti-
bodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, www.cellsignal.com) and
enhanced chemiluminescence imaging (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, www.bio-rad.com) using the ChemiDoc-It Imag-

RESULTS

Activated NSC K-Ras Expression Leads to Increased
Astrogliogenesis In Vivo

To deÔ¨Åne the impact of activated Ras expression on NSC func-
tion in vivo, we leveraged BLBP-Cre mice to target-activated
Ras molecule expression to brain ventricular zone NSCs capa-
ble of giving rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes
in vivo (multilineage differentiation)
[35]. This speciÔ¨Åc Cre
driver strain was chosen, since Ras activation in nestin1 cells
(nestin-Cre mice) is likely to result in embryonic lethality due
to a defect in cardiac vessel septation [40]. Moreover, we
have previously used this particular BLBP-Cre strain to exam-
ine the impact of neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis-1 loss on gliogenesis in
vivo [35].

There were no changes in the percentages of (C) APC1 oligodendrocytes or (D) NeuN1 neurons in the three Ras*BLBP genotypes relative
to littermate controls. Error bars represent the SEM. Abbreviation: GFAP, glial Ô¨Åbrillary acidic protein.

The expression of each individual-activated Ras allele was
accomplished using mice in which an oncogenic version was
knocked into the endogenous Ras locus. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, these
RasLSL (H-RasLSL-G12V, K-RasLSL-G12D, or N-RasLSL-G12D) mice con-
tain a transcriptional stop element Ô¨Çanked by LoxP sites (Lox-
Stop-Lox [LSL]) that prevents expression of the mutationally
activated Ras alleles in the absence of Cre expression. Follow-
ing Cre-mediated recombination, mutationally activated Ras
(Ras*) is expressed from its endogenous promoter.

Since the majority of neuronal and non-neuronal cell fate
speciÔ¨Åcation occurs by 3 weeks following birth, we examined
the consequence of activated Ras molecule expression on

brain cell development at postnatal day 18 (PN18). At PN18,
there was a greater percentage of astrocytes in K-Ras*BLBP,
but not H-Ras*BLBP or N-Ras*BLBP, mice relative to littermate
controls using glial Ô¨Åbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1.8-fold)
and S100b (1.2-fold) astrocyte antibodies (Fig. 1A, 1B).
In
contrast, there was no change in APC1 oligodendrocytes
(Fig. 1C) or NeuN1 neurons (Fig. 1D) or differences in brain
or body weights across the three Ras genotypes relative to
controls (Supporting Information Fig. S3). These data demon-
strate that activated K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, expres-
sion in NSCs leads to the generation of more astrocytes in
vivo.

Activated K-Ras Expression Does Not Alter NSC Astro-
cyte Differentiation

To determine whether activated K-Ras expression alters brain
NSC astrocyte differentiation, we used neurosphere cultures
generated from brainstems of PN1 pups infected with adenovirus
expressing either LacZ (control cells, CTL) or Cre recombinase
(activated H-Ras, K-Ras, or N-Ras, denoted H-Ras*, K-Ras*, or N-
Ras*, respectively). Raf1-RBD afÔ¨Ånity chromatography conÔ¨Årmed
that Ras activation was comparably increased after Ad5-Cre infec-
tion (Fig. 2A). Following in vitro differentiation of these NSCs for
more than 6 days in adherent culture, only K-Ras*-expressing
NSCs exhibited increased numbers of GFAP1 astrocytes (1.8-fold)
relative to controls (Fig. 2B). Importantly, K-Ras*-expressing NSC
cultures also showed an increase in the total number of DAPI1
cells (1.8-fold) compared to control cells (Fig. 2C). The increase in

GFAP1 cells proportional to total DAPI1 cells resulted in no
change in the percentage of GFAP1 cells compared to controls
(Fig. 2D),
indicating that activated K-Ras expression does not
directly change NSC astrocyte differentiation.

To determine whether the increase in astrocyte numbers
following K-Ras* expression reÔ¨Çected an increase in the NSC
pool during differentiation (EdU incorporation), we examined
differentiating cells at both early (1 day postplating) and late
(5 days postplating) time points (Fig. 3A). In addition to EdU
incorporation, neuroglial
lineage antibodies for NSCs (Sox2)
and astrocytes (GFAP) were used to quantify changes in both
populations. After 1 day in culture, K-Ras*-expressing cells
were proliferating 7.4-fold more than their control counter-
parts (Fig. 3B). These proliferating cells were exclusively Sox21
NSCs, and not GFAP1 astrocytes (Fig. 3C). At this time, there
was no change in the percentage of Sox21 NSCs; however, a

Activated K-Ras Expression Increases NSC Proliferation
In Vitro

To determine whether the individual Ras* molecules differen-
tially increase NSC growth in vitro, we directly counted NSCs
after 5 days in culture. Similar to the above Ô¨Åndings, 2.3-fold
more K-Ras*-, but not H-Ras*- or N-Ras*-, expressing NSCs
were observed relative to controls (Fig. 4A). At this time, K-
Ras*-, but not H-Ras*- or N-Ras*-, expressing neurospheres
had a 1.6-fold increase in the percentage of Ki671 proliferat-
ing cells (Fig. 4B). Following continued in vitro passage, this K-
Ras*-expressing NSC growth advantage was sustained for
approximately Ô¨Åve passages, after which, both control and K-
Ras*-expressing NSCs failed to survive (Supporting Information
Fig. S4). To determine whether the increased K-Ras* NSC
growth reÔ¨Çected increased proliferation or decreased cell
death, Ô¨Çow cytometry was used. Using propidium iodide to
analyze
K-Ras*-expressing
NSCs were in the precycling G0/G1 phase (24.6%) of the cell
cycle relative to controls, while more K-Ras*-expressing NSCs
were in S phase (13.6%) and G2/M phase (12.6%) (Fig. 4C,
4D). Finally, using annexin-V staining to identify cells under-
going programmed cell death (apoptosis), no differences were
found between live and apoptotic K-Ras*-expressing and con-
trol NSCs (Fig. 4E, 4F). Collectively, these data are consistent
with a model
in which activated K-Ras expression increases
NSC proliferation to expand the NSC pool and result in a pro-
portional

populations (Sox21 NSCs, Olig21 glial-restricted progenitor
cells) were observed at
time
points, shortly after K-Ras*BLBP activation (E12.5) and at birth
(PN1). In the E12.5 hindbrain (the future postnatal pons), K-
Ras*BLBP mice harbored twofold more Sox21 NSCs per unit
area (0.1 mm2) relative to littermate controls (Fig. 5A). At PN1,
no difference in the numbers of Sox21 NSCs was observed in
the brainstems of K-Ras*BLBP versus littermate control mice
(Fig. 5B). However, at PN1, there was a 1.9-fold increase in the
numbers of Olig21 glial-restricted progenitor cells following
activated K-Ras expression (Fig. 5C). Together, these data dem-
onstrate that activated K-Ras expression in NSCs results in an
early expansion of progenitor cells, which likely underlies the
increase in astrocytes observed in the K-Ras*BLBP mouse brain-
stem at PN18.

Using a Raf-RBD afÔ¨Ånity assay, K-Ras activation activity was
30-fold higher in K-Ras*-expressing NSCs relative to controls

ical inhibitor studies were used to deÔ¨Åne the downstream sig-
naling pathway responsible for activated K-Ras

control of NSC proliferation. We experimentally deÔ¨Åned the
minimal doses of pharmacological
required to
reduce K-Ras* effector pathway hyperactivation to WT control
levels (data not shown). First, we conÔ¨Årmed that K-Ras activa-
tion was required for K-Ras*-induced NSC hyperproliferation
using the GGTI-286 geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor. Follow-
ing GGTI-286 (6.5 lM) treatment, the hyperproliferation of K-
Ras* NSCs was reduced to that of control cells, as measured
by direct cell counting (Fig. 6B, Supporting Information Fig.
S5A). Western blot analysis of the Ras downstream effector
protein Erk revealed reduced p-Erk activity following GGTI-286
inhibition. Similarly, infection of K-Ras* NSCs with dominant-
negative K-Ras (dnK-RasN17; [39]) reduced K-Ras* NSC hyper-
proliferation to that of control cells, as measured by direct
cell counting (Fig. 6C, Supporting Information Fig. S5B).

Third,

to determine whether Raf/Mek signaling was
responsible for K-Ras*-induced NSC hyperproliferation, K-Ras*-
expressing NSCs were treated with the PD0325901 (PD901;
2 nM) or MEK162 (50 nM) Mek inhibitors. Treatment with
either PD901 or MEK162 reduced Erk hyperactivation, but did
not attenuate K-Ras*-mediated NSC hyperproliferation (Fig.
6F, 6G, Supporting Information Fig. S5D, S5E).

These unexpected results prompted a detailed examination
of other potential Raf effector proteins. While we observed no
change in Akt, Jnk, PKC-c, PKC-f, Ran, b-catenin, and Yap activ-
ity, Src and p38MAPK were hyperactivated (increased SrcY416
and p38MAPKT180/Y182 phosphorylation, respectively) in K-Ras*-
expressing NSCs compared to controls (Supporting Information
Fig. S6A, S6B). However, pharmacologic inhibition of Src
(50 nM AZD0530) or p38MAPK (20 lM SB203580) activity did
not reduce K-Ras*-induced NSC hyperproliferation (Supporting
Information Fig. S6C, S6D). Similarly, neither GGTI-286 (Ras
inhibitor) nor AZ628 (Raf inhibitor) treatments reduced Src or
p38MAPK hyperactivation (Supporting Information Fig. S6E).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that K-Ras* expression
increases NSC proliferation in a Raf-dependent, but Mek-, Src-,
and p38MAPK-independent, manner.

Raf-1 Inhibition of Rb Is Responsible for Activated
K-Ras-Induced NSC Hyperproliferation

To determine how K-Ras* regulates NSC proliferation, we
focused on potential Raf-dependent mechanisms. Previous
studies have shown that Raf-1 (c-Raf) directly binds the reti-
noblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) to relieve Rb-

data establish a new model for K-Ras* regulation of NSC pro-
liferation, in which K-Ras activation of Raf leads to Rb binding
and inhibition, and leads to increased G0/G1 to S transition
and proliferation (Fig. 7C).

DISCUSSION

Despite the central role of Ras in regulating embryonic devel-
opment, the three Ras molecules do not equally impact on
this process. For example, biallelic K-Ras deletion in mice
results in lethality between 12 and 14 days of gestation, due to
brainstem defects, hematopoietic abnormalities, and organ fail-
ure [45, 46]. In contrast, H-Ras or N-Ras deletion, either sepa-
rately or in combination, does not impair normal embryonic
development, resulting in healthy adult mice [47, 48]. These dif-
ferential effects are further highlighted by observations made

VC AlphaMed Press 2015

in human neurogenetic disorders characterized by germline
activating mutations in the three RAS genes (collectively
termed ‚ÄúRASopathies‚Äù). In these RASopathies, H-RAS mutations
[26] have been reported in Costello syndrome, whereas individ-
uals with Noonan syndrome harbor K-RAS mutations [27], each
with varying neurocognitive delays and learning disabilities. The
importance of differential Ras molecule activation is additionally
underscored by the Ô¨Ånding of oncogenic K-RAS, but not H-RAS
or N-RAS, mutations in pediatric brain tumors [49, 50].

Herein, we demonstrate that activated K-Ras, but not H-
Ras or N-Ras, molecule expression increases the proliferation
of brain NSCs. While no prior studies have systematically com-
pared the consequences of expressing these three individual-
activated Ras molecules in the brain, previous work in other
tissue types has revealed divergent functions for each of
these proteins.
In neural crest-derived hematopoietic cells,
activated N-Ras is the primary regulator of cell self-renewal,

tissues (lungs and colon) [36, 55]. Similarly,

motes cell differentiation and suppresses cell growth, in con-
trast to K-RasG12V overexpression that promotes stem cell

proliferation and inhibits cell differentiation [56]. Moreover, K-
RasG12D expression increases the proliferation of an intestinal
stem cell population, whereas N-RasG12D expression increases
the resistance of these cells to apoptosis without changing
cell proliferation [37]. Lastly, K-RasG12D expression has also
been reported to cause bronchioalveolar stem cell hyper-
proliferation in the lung [55]. Taken together, these stud-
ies identify K-Ras* as a potent driver of progenitor cell
proliferation, which is consistent with our Ô¨Ånding that
only
activated K-Ras expression promotes brain NSC
proliferation.

Deregulated RAS signaling is an important step in cancer
initiation, with activating RAS mutations implicated in 30% of
all cancers [57]. Of particular relevance to this study is the
prevalence of activating K-RAS gene mutations (22% of all can-
cers) relative to mutations in either the H-RAS or N-RAS genes
(11% of all cancers combined). Although our study focused on
the developmental implications of activated Ras expression on
NSC function, the increased NSC proliferation observed follow-
ing K-Ras* expression prompted us to examine mice for tumor
formation. In a small number of K-Ras*BLBP mice (n 5 3) aged
to 8 weeks of age, all developed squamous cell papillomas of
the vagina/anus. Complete necropsy did not reveal any pathol-
ogy indicative of a brain tumor (data not shown). These Ô¨Ånd-
ings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that
oncogenic Ras expression leads to increased proliferation with-
out subsequent tumor formation. In these studies, expression
of the same K-RasLSL allele in colonic epithelial cells resulted in
hyperplasia, but not neoplasia, of the intestinal epithelium
[37]. It was only when K-Ras* expression was combined with
loss of Apc expression did colonic tumors form. Similarly, K-
Ras* expression alone in nestin1 or GFAP1 neural stem/pro-
genitor cells in the brain was not sufÔ¨Åcient for tumor forma-
tion [51, 58], yet led to glioblastoma when combined with
constitutively active Akt expression [59].

Given the high level of sequence similarity between the
three Ras molecules and their capacity to signal to a similar
subset of downstream effector proteins,
it is striking that
these molecules have such divergent
functions. However,
these differences are conferred by unique 25-amino acid, C-
terminal HVRs. During post-translational processing, the Ras
molecules are Ô¨Årst prenylated by farnesyltransferase, which
allows for trafÔ¨Åcking to the endoplasmic reticulum [60, 61].
After this step, Ras molecule post-translational processing
diverges: K-Ras becomes more highly methylated than its H-
Ras and N-Ras counterparts [30]. H-Ras and N-Ras are then
palmitoylated and trafÔ¨Åcked to the PM through the Golgi
apparatus while methylated K-Ras is trafÔ¨Åcked to the PM
independent of the Golgi
[31, 58]. The exact mechanism
responsible for mediating K-Ras trafÔ¨Åcking is unknown; how-
ever, its transport has been shown to be dependent on a pol-
ybasic, lysine-rich portion of the K-Ras HVR not found within
the HVRs of H-Ras or N-Ras [62]. Following its PM localization,
each Ras molecule occupies a different microdomain: N-Ras is
found in lipid raft domains, while K-Ras localizes to non-lipid
raft portions of the membrane [32, 63]. H-Ras occupies lipid
raft domains when inactive, but translocates to non-lipid raft
membrane upon activation (in areas distinct from those occu-
pied by K-Ras) [32, 64]. In addition, H-Ras and N-Ras are also
capable of signaling to downstream effectors from the Golgi,
a capability not shared by K-Ras [65, 66]. Collectively, the

divergent processing and localization of the Ras molecules
likely account for their capacities to signal to different subsets
of downstream proteins to generate different biological out-
comes [33, 34].

signal

Ras/Raf

transduction most commonly operates
through Raf activation of Mek1/2 [67‚Äì69]. In striking contrast
to this canonical signaling mechanism, we demonstrate that
activated K-Ras expression increases brain NSC proliferation in
a Raf-dependent manner that operates independent of Mek.
Precedent
for Mek-independent Ras/Raf growth control
derives from several studies performed in numerous different
cell types. First, Raf-1 overexpression has been shown to
increase cell survival by inhibiting ASK-1 function in the pres-
ence of the Mek pharmacological
inhibitors PD98059 and
U0126 [70]. Second, K-Ras*-expressing DLD-1 cells continue to
proliferate despite treatment with the Mek inhibitor CI-1040.
Proliferation of these cells was only inhibited in the presence
of the Raf inhibitor AZ628 [37]. Third, protein binding discov-
ery studies have revealed several other potential Raf binding
partners, including the 14-3-3-zeta protein, which modulates
Raf signaling during cell stress through its association with
keratin 8/18 [71, 72]. Fourth, both B-Raf and Raf-1 associate
with PKC-theta to inactivate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family pro-
tein BAD and increase cell survival [73]. While these studies
collectively identify a role for Raf in cell growth, we found
that K-Ras*-dependent brain NSC hyperproliferation depends
on the productive interaction between Raf-1 and the retino-
blastoma (Rb) cell cycle regulator [42].

The Rb tumor suppressor protein prevents cell cycle pro-
gression by inhibiting the expression of the E2F transcription
factors to prevent DNA synthesis. Upon growth factor stimula-
tion, this inhibition is relieved, allowing cells to progress
through the cell cycle. Using genetic and biochemical techni-
ques to alter Ras expression in the presence or absence of Rb
expression, early work established a hierarchy for Ras/Rb/cell
cycle regulation, whereby Ras inhibition of Rb function led to
increased proliferation [74, 75]. The mechanism underlying
this Ras/Rb connection was identiÔ¨Åed when direct binding
between Raf-1 and Rb was revealed [42]. Consistent with pre-
vious studies demonstrating that the RRD-251 small peptide
interrupts this interaction and block tumor cell growth [42‚Äì44,
76‚Äì78], we found that K-Ras*-induced NSC hyperproliferation
depended on Raf/Rb binding and inhibition of Rb function.

In summary, using a novel collection of conditional Ras
genetically engineered mouse strains and derivative NSCs, we
establish differential effects of the three activated Ras mole-
cules on brain NSC proliferation. Moreover, the elucidation of
a nonconventional mechanism underlying Ras/Raf-mediated
NSC growth control suggests additional determinants relevant
to the study of diseases characterized by deregulated RAS
function. Future studies characterizing differences in Ras mol-
ecule function in disease-pertinent models will be critical to
further deÔ¨Åning and ultimately treating these disorders.

CONCLUSIONS

To our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst study to compare the
impact of regulated expression of all three activated Ras
alleles on brain NSC function using identically constructed
genetically engineered mouse strains. Using this approach,
activated K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, expression increases

NSC proliferation without altering astrocyte differentiation.
Additionally, K-Ras* regulates NSC proliferation in a Raf-
dependent manner, not involving the Raf downstream effec-
tors Mek and Erk. Instead, K-Ras* increases brain NSC prolifer-
ation through Raf
inhibition of the Rb tumor suppressor
protein, thereby releasing Rb-mediated suppression of cell
cycle progression. This comparison of the activated Ras mole-
cules will be relevant for future studies that aim to interpret
the differential contributions of the Ras molecules to neuro-
developmental disorders resulting from activated Ras mole-
cule expression.
