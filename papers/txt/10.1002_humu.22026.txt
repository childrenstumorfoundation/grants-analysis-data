ABSTRACT: Noonan syndrome (NS) is among the most
common nonchromosomal disorders affecting develop-
ment and growth. NS is genetically heterogeneous, be-
ing caused by germline mutations affecting various genes
implicated in the RAS signaling network. This network
transduces extracellular signals into intracellular biochem-
ical and transcriptional responses controlling cell prolifer-
ation, differentiation, metabolism, and senescence. To ex-
plore the transcriptional consequences of NS-causing mu-
tations, we performed global mRNA expression proﬁling
on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 23
NS patients carrying heterozygous mutations in PTPN11
or SOS1. Gene expression proﬁling was also resolved in
ﬁve subjects with Noonan-like syndrome with loose ana-
gen hair (NS/LAH), a condition clinically related to NS
and caused by an invariant mutation in SHOC2. Robust
transcriptional signatures were found to speciﬁcally dis-
criminate each of the three mutation groups from 21 age-
and sex-matched controls. Despite the only partial overlap
in terms of gene composition, the three signatures showed
a notable concordance in terms of biological processes
and regulatory circuits affected. These data establish ex-
pression proﬁling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
as a powerful tool to appreciate differential perturbations
driven by germline mutations of transducers involved in
RAS signaling and to dissect molecular mechanisms un-
derlying NS and other RASopathies.

Introduction

Dysregulation of RAS signaling has recently been recognized to
underlie a group of clinically related disorders affecting develop-
ment and growth [Schubbert et al., 2007; Tartaglia and Gelb, 2010;
Tidyman and Rauen, 2009]. Most of these conditions, which are
collectively named as RASopathies, share facial dysmorphism, a
wide spectrum of heart disease, reduced postnatal growth, vari-
able cognitive defects, and susceptibility to certain malignancies.
In these Mendelian traits, heterozygous germline mutations affect
various genes coding for members of the small subfamily of RAS
GTPases, signal relay proteins that function as modulators of RAS
function, RAS effectors, and downstream signal transducers. De-
spite the majority of mutations appear to enhance signal trafﬁc
through the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) axis,
each syndrome maintains indeed distinctive phenotypic features.
In some of these disorders, a further level of complexity is due to
genetic heterogeneity, which explains, in part, the observed clini-
cal variability. Noonan syndrome (NS, OMIM 163950), which is
the most common among these diseases, occurring approximately
in 1:1000–1:2500 live births, represents a paradigmatic condition
[Allanson, 2007; Tartaglia et al., 2010; Van der Burgt, 2007]. NS is
genetically heterogeneous, with activating mutations in PTPN11,
SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, and BRAF occurring in approximately
75% of affected individuals [Tartaglia et al., 2011]. NS is a clini-
cally variable disorder, and recent studies have established clinically
relevant genotype–phenotype correlations, such as a high preva-
lence of pulmonic stenosis among subjects with a mutated PTPN11
allele, occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in individuals
heterozygous for a mutation in RAF1, or generally normal growth
and cognition in subjects carrying a mutated SOS1 gene [Tartaglia
et al., 2010]. In contrast to what observed in NS, other RASopathies
exhibit a relatively homogeneous phenotype that generally reﬂects
an underlying genetic homogeneity. This is the case of Noonan-
like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NL/LAH), a rare condition
with clinical features partially overlapping those occurring in NS
[Mazzanti et al., 2003], and caused by the invariant c.4A>G missense
change (p.Ser2Gly) in SHOC2 [Cordeddu et al., 2009], a scaffold
protein with regulatory function that positively modulate RAS sig-
naling [Matsunaga-Udagawa et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Viciana et al.,
2006].

To provide ﬁrst insights on the pathogenetic mechanisms under-
lying NS and related RASopathies, a number of studies have been
directed to investigate the consequences of panels of disease-causing
mutations on protein structure and function, and their perturbing
effects on intracellular signaling [Tartaglia et al., 2010]. No attempt
has been directed, however, to investigate the consequences of the
aberrant activation of the RAS signaling network driven by the
different disease-causing molecular lesions on the control of gene
expression. Here, we explored the global gene expression proﬁle of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from two
cohorts of subjects with mutations in the two most common NS
disease genes (PTPN11 and SOS1), and a third group representative
of the genetically homogeneous NS/LAH (SHOC2) in order to iden-
tify transcriptional signatures speciﬁcally associated with aberrant
PTPN11/SHP2, SOS1, and SHOC2 function, as well as to evaluate
the extent and branching of intracellular signaling dysregulation
associated with these speciﬁc pathological conditions.

Methods

Patients Selection

The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the
Regina Margherita Childrens’ Hospital, Torino, Italy. Informed con-
sent was obtained from parents or guardians of all participants.
Patients were enrolled in the study between March 2006 and May
2008. Controls are children with staturo-ponderal and neuromotor
development within normal limits. The diagnosis of NS was estab-
lished according to Van der Burgt clinical criteria [van der Burgt
et al., 1994] and conﬁrmed by molecular analysis on genomic DNA
isolated from 200 μl of peripheral blood by the QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The 15 coding exons
and exon/intron junctions of PTPN11 were ampliﬁed by PCR with
FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics Corporation,
Indianapolis, IN) under standard conditions with the primers listed
in Tartaglia et al. [2002], SOS1 analysis was carried out by am-
pliﬁcation and sequencing of the 23 exons as previously described
[Tartaglia et al., 2007] and SHOC2 gene was studied as reported in
Cordeddu et al. [2009]. The study cohort included 23 subjects with
a diagnosis of NS associated with a germline mutation in PTPN11
(N = 17) or SOS1 (N = 6), and ﬁve individuals with NS/LAH due
to the invariant c.4A>G missense change in SHOC2. Mutation data
(location of affected residues and type of amino acid substitution)
are resumed in Supp. Table S1. Additional 21 samples were ob-
tained from age- and sex-matched controls. Informed consent was
obtained from all subjects included in the study.

RNA Extraction and Processing for Microarray

RNA was extracted from PBMCs, isolated form fresh blood sam-
ples within 2 hr from collection, using the TRIzol Plus RNA pu-
riﬁcation system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The quantiﬁcation and quality analysis
of RNA was performed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technolo-
gies, Palo Alto, CA). Synthesis of cDNA and biotinylated cRNA
was performed using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit
(Ambion, Foster City, CA; Cat. n. IL1791), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Quality assessment and quantiﬁcation of cRNAs
were performed with Agilent RNA kits on Bioanalyzer 2100. Hy-
bridization of cRNAs (750 ng) was carried out on HumanRef8_V2
BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Array washing was per-
formed using Illumina High stringency wash buffer for 10 min at

C, followed by staining using streptavidin-Cy3 dyes (Amersham
55
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), according to standard Illumina
protocols.

Data Analysis

Cubic spline-normalized probe intensity data, together with de-
tection P-values, were obtained using the BeadStudio 3.1 software
(Illumina). Subsequent data processing, carried out with Excel (Mi-
crosoft Corp., Redmond, WA) included: (1) scaling, Log2 transfor-
mation, and detection ﬁltering; (2) removal of genes correlated with
age, sex, or differential leukocyte count; (3) Log2Ratio transforma-
tion and selection of genes differentially expressed between controls
and mutated groups; (4) Monte carlo simulation for false discov-
ery rate estimation; (5) full leave-one-out classiﬁcation analysis.
All procedures are described in detail in Supp. Methods. Log2Ratio
expression data were clustered and visualized using the GEDAS soft-
ware [Fu and Medico, 2007].

Results

PBMC Gene Expression Proﬁling of NS and NS/LAH
Patients

PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2 gene expression in human PBMCs
was preliminarily veriﬁed by in silico analysis on a published PBMC
gene expression dataset [Burczynski et al., 2006]. The analysis in-
dicated that these and other disease genes known to be implicated
in RASopathies are expressed, at varying levels, in human PBMCs
(Supp. Fig. S1). For gene expression proﬁling (GEP), we selected 23
NS patients including 17 subjects carrying a mutation in PTPN11
and six with a SOS1 lesion, ﬁve NS/LAH subjects with the invariant
c.4A>G SHOC2 mutation, and 21 age- and sex-matched controls
(Supp. Table S1). Total RNA extracted from PBMCs was processed
for GEP on Illumina Beadarrays. We veriﬁed expression of PTPN11,
SOS1, and SHOC2 mRNA in our samples by checking microarray
probe signal intensities for PTPN11 and SOS1, and quantitative real-
time PCR signals for SHOC2 that was not represented on the arrays
(Supp. Fig. S2). Out of the 20,589 probes analyzed on the array, 5,605
passed ﬁltering for reliable signal detection and for not being cor-
related with age, sex, or differential leukocyte count (Supp. Fig. S3
and Supp. Methods). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all
samples based on these probes revealed four major transcriptional
subgroups, two of which were enriched, respectively, in NS/LAH
and NS samples (Supp. Fig. S4). For supervised statistical detection
of genes differentially expressed between NS and NS/LAH samples
and controls, a multiple test including fold change (absolute Log2
ratio > 0.5), t-test (P < 0.01), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 0.5;
see also Supp. Methods) was applied to the following comparisons:
(1) NS+NS/LAH samples versus controls; (2) PTPN11 mutation-
positive samples versus controls; (3) SOS1 mutation-positive sam-
ples versus controls; and (4) SHOC2 mutation-positive samples ver-
sus controls. Four signatures were thus identiﬁed, composed of 125,
225, 73, and 1407 probes, respectively (Supp. Table S2). A Monte
Carlo simulation considering 2,000 random sample permutations
was performed that allowed estimating the fraction of false positive
hits as acceptably low (0.001–5.5%; Supp.Table S3).

NS and NS/LAH Gene-Speciﬁc Transcriptional Signatures
in Human PBMCs

Expression of genes belonging to the four signatures is shown in
Figure 1. Of note, the signatures obtained separately for the PTPN11,

Higher than average (red) and lower than average (green) expression
levels are indicated according to the color bar reported below the dia-
gram. Samples are subdivided in four groups, from left to right: controls
(C-001–C-021), NS with a mutated PTPN11allele (PT-001–PT-017), NS
with a SOS1mutation (SO-001–SO-006), and NS/LAH with the c.4A>G
change (SH-001–SH-005). Four major transcriptional signatures com-
posed of genes that signiﬁcantly discriminate control samples from
(1) PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2mutation-positive samples (NS+NS/LAH
signature, 125 gene probes), (2) PTPN11 mutation-positive samples
(PTPN11 signature, 225 probes), (3) SOS1 mutation-positive samples
(SOS1signature, 73 probes), and (4) SHOC2mutation-positive samples
(SHOC2signature, 1,407 probes) are shown.

SOS1, and SHOC2 mutations were found to discriminate more ef-
ﬁciently the individual mutation groups from controls, compared
to the signature characterizing the entire “RASopathy” cohort of
PBMCs with mutated PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2 alleles, indicating
occurrence of signiﬁcant heterogeneity among subgroups. Indeed,
the three disease gene-speciﬁc signatures displayed detectable, but
only partial overlaps (Supp. Table S2E). The signature character-
izing NS/LAH was the largest, including 1,394 genes. Within this
group, the expression proﬁles were highly homogeneous, possibly
because of the invariant occurrence of the SHOC2 c.4A>G mutation
underlying this disorder, and appeared to be oppositely modulated
within both the PTPN11 and SOS1 mutation-associated NS groups.
A robust signature, characterized by 223 differently expressed genes
was also attained for the PTPN11 mutation group. This signature
was shared, in part, with the SHOC2 mutation group, while it no-

results of a full
leave-one-out classiﬁcation analysis. Brieﬂy, each
PBMC sample was left out of the dataset and received four clas-
siﬁcation scores (y-axis, A–D) based on four signatures, fully con-
structed on the remaining samples: (A) NS+NS/LAH signature; (B)
PTPN11mutation-associated signature; (C) SOS1mutation-associated
signature; (D) SHOC2mutation-associated signature. Samples are sub-
divided in four groups, as indicated on thex-axis, based on the genotype.

ticeably diverged in the SOS1 mutation group. Differently from
what observed in the PTPN11 and SHOC2 mutation cohorts, the
SOS1 mutation group shared a signature with restricted size, which,
however, appeared to efﬁciently discriminate this group from con-
trols. The SOS1 mutation-associated signature appeared oppositely
modulated in the SHOC2 mutation group, while it was relatively
conserved among samples of the PTPN11 mutation group.

Overall, these ﬁndings document that the PTPN11, SOS1, and
SHOC2 mutations induce detectable gene expression changes in
PBMCs, and suggest that the speciﬁc perturbation in gene expres-
sion modulation occurring within each subgroup cannot be simply
ascribed to a differential perturbing effect of mutations in individual
disease genes on the extent of signal ﬂow through a common signal
transduction pathway (i.e., the RAS-MAPK cascade).

To verify whether the disease gene-speciﬁc signatures could re-
liably distinguish samples with mutations in the respective disease
genes from control samples in a diagnostic setting, we performed
full leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. Brieﬂy, each sample (ei-
ther mutated or not) was individually removed from the dataset, and
the remaining samples were used to select again signiﬁcant genes
and redeﬁne the four signatures. The left-out sample was then clas-
siﬁed by calculating a weighted average score for each signature
(NS+NS/LAH, PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2; see Supp. Methods).
Finally, the four classiﬁcation scores for each sample were displayed
in dot plots (Fig. 2) and used for t-test-based statistics. Overall, the
705

RASopathy-associated score was signiﬁcantly different between con-
trol and NS+NS/LAH samples (t-test P-value < 0.001). It correctly
classiﬁed all the SHOC2 samples as well as the majority of PTPN11
samples (P < 0.001), but failed to discern SOS1 mutation-positive
samples from controls (P = 0.29). The PTPN11 mutation-associated
score was documented to discriminate efﬁciently samples with a
mutated PTPN11 allele from healthy controls (P < 0.001) and those
with SOS1 mutations (P < 0.005), but not from samples with mu-
tated SHOC2 (P = 0.706). The SOS1 mutation score maintained
a signiﬁcant discrimination efﬁcacy against control samples (P <
0.001), but displayed low speciﬁcity. Finally, the SHOC2 mutation
score, despite being derived from just four samples in the “leave-one
out” approach, displayed very good sensitivity and speciﬁcity against
both controls (P < 0.001) and other mutated samples (SHOC2 vs
PTPN11: P < 0.001; SHOC2 vs SOS1 P < 0.001). Overall, these results
represent proof of concept that PBMC-derived transcriptional sig-
natures are sufﬁciently robust to be considered as distinctive for each
of the different conditions and to eventually be used for diagnostic
purposes.

In silico Data Mining Reveals Biological Signiﬁcance
of NS and NS/LAH Mutation-Speciﬁc Signatures

To functionally characterize genes transcriptionally associated to
NS and NS/LAH causative mutations, we tested the PTPN11, SOS1,
and SHOC2 mutation-speciﬁc signatures for enrichment in func-
tional annotation keywords using DAVID [Huang da W et al., 2009;
see Supp. Methods). This analysis was conducted ﬁrst using all the
genes of each signature, then using subgroups of only up- or down-
regulated genes. As shown in Supp. Table S4, the PTPN11 signature
was found to be enriched in genes encoding proteins with SH2 do-
mains (P < 0.001) and tyrosine-speciﬁc protein kinases (P < 0.01).
The SOS1 signature did not show signiﬁcant enrichments, whereas
the downregulated genes of the SHOC2 signature were strongly en-
riched for genes having regulatory role in transcription (P < 10–7).
These results prompted additional data mining focused on genes
implicated in signal transduction and transcriptional control. The
three signatures were therefore assessed for signiﬁcant enrichment
in kinase targets via the web-based “Kinase Enrichment Analysis”
tool [Lachmann et al., 2009] (Table 1). Interestingly, this analysis
documented that the PTPN11 signature displayed highly signiﬁ-
cant enrichment in targets of tyrosine kinases, particularly SRC
family kinases (FYN, LYN, LCK, SRC) and SRC family interacting
kinases (CSK, SYK, ZAP70). Despite its small size, the SOS1 signa-
ture displayed signiﬁcant enrichment in substrates of LCK, while
the SHOC2 signature was enriched in targets of MAPK and SRC
family members and their interacting kinases. These data show that
a signiﬁcant percentage of genes transcriptionally modulated by NS
and NS/LAH disease-causing alleles are themselves known targets
of tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction.

Subsequently, we focused on protein–protein interactions, using
the Gather [Chang and Nevins, 2006] and Genes2networks [Berger
et al., 2007; see Supp. Methods] web-based tools. Of note, the
only protein displaying signiﬁcant interactor enrichment in both
PTPN11 and SHOC2 signatures with both tools was CBL, recently
found to be mutated in a condition partially overlapping NS [Mar-
tinelli et al., 2010]. These data suggest that protein–protein interac-
tion in silico analysis of gene expression signatures referred to the
different RASopathies can represent an informative tool to identify
new candidate disease genes for these disorders.

The fact that the SHOC2 mutation was found to downregulate
a large number of transcription factors (TFs) prompted us to an
in-depth analysis of circuits of transcriptional regulation within the

NS and NS/LAH signatures. To this aim, we searched for cases of
concomitant presence within the same signature of TFs and their
predicted targets. The results of this analysis, performed by the
Opossum tool [Ho Sui et al., 2005], highlighted four cases of con-
comitant and signiﬁcant coregulation (Supp. Table S5 and Supp.
Methods). In PTPN11-mutated samples, GFI1 was negatively reg-
ulated with respect to controls (P < 0.001) and its targets were
preferentially downmodulated. In SOS1-mutated samples, GABPA
was signiﬁcantly upregulated (P < 0.01) and its targets were prefer-
entially downregulated. Finally, SHOC2-mutated samples displayed
higher expression of CREB1 (P < 0.001) and SP1 (P < 0.001), while
the respective targets were preferentially downregulated. Overall,
these results indicate the presence of at least one transcriptional
regulation circuit in each signature (Fig. 3).

Discussion

Transcriptome analysis is a key tool to explore biological com-
plexity of human diseases. We applied this approach to RASopathies
with the aim of ﬁnding molecular correlates of the mutational status
in PBMCs, focusing on the two genes most frequently mutated in
NS, PTPN11, and SOS1, and on SHOC2, which has been recently
discovered to cause NS/LAH, a disorder with clinical overlap with
the former [Cordeddu et al., 2009].

When grouped together and compared to age-matched unaf-
fected individuals, NS and NS/LAH-derived samples yielded a tran-
scriptional signature of 123 genes that correctly classiﬁed most sam-
ples. Such a signature, however, was not representative for the sam-
ples heterozygous for a mutated SOS1 allele and a fraction of sub-
jects with mutations in PTPN11. When the overall cohort of NS
patients was subdivided on the basis of the genetic lesion in the
three gene-speciﬁc subgroups, larger and more homogeneous sig-
natures emerged despite the lower sizes of subgroups. These results
show that, although germline mutations in PTPN11, SOS1, and

efﬁcient activation of growth factor-induced RAS-MAPK signaling
via multiple potential mechanisms [Dance et al., 2008]. Moreover,
besides the positive modulatory role on RAS signaling, SHP2 con-
trols additional signal transduction pathways, as those linked to
STAT and SRC proteins that are well known to contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to transcriptional control [Grossmann et al., 2009; Xu and Qu,
2008; Zhang et al., 2004]. SOS1 has instead a narrower role, being
a bifunctional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAS
and RAC [Nimnual and Bar-Sagi, 2002]. This difference in func-
tion together with the possibility of a cell context speciﬁcity of the
perturbing effect of mutations on intracellular signaling could ex-
plain the only partial overlap between the signatures characterizing
the SOS1- and PTPN11-mutation groups. Of particular relevance
is the fact that the invariant c.4A>G (p.Ser2Gly) SHOC2 mutation
was observed to provoke a profound alteration in the PBMC tran-
scriptome. SHOC2 encodes a widely expressed protein supposed to
be required for efﬁcient RAF1 activation following growth factor
stimulation by promoting membrane translocation of the catalytic
subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) that is required for sta-
ble RAF1 binding to RAS [Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2006]. The
invariant missense change was demonstrated to introduce an N-
myristoylation site that causes stable translocation to the plasma
membrane of the mutated protein and enhanced ERK1/2 phospho-
rylation in a cell context-dependent fashion [Cordeddu et al., 2009].
Being a scaffold protein permanently anchored at the plasma mem-
brane, myristylated SHOC2 may exert still uncharacterized actions
leading to massive transcriptional deregulation. Intriguingly, 110
of the 225 genes composing the PTPN11 signature are also present
and concordant in the SHOC2 signature, but most of the remaining
several hundreds of the SHOC2 signature genes display a SHOC2-
speciﬁc behavior. This ﬁnding strongly suggests that SHOC2 might
control not only the RAS-MAPK axis, but also other signaling path-
ways and/or cellular processes. Consistent with the present ﬁndings,
it was demonstrated that SHOC2 translocates in the nucleus fol-
lowing growth factor stimulation [Cordeddu et al., 2009], which
supports the idea of a possible direct involvement of this protein in
the control of processes linked to gene expression.

Another striking ﬁnding of this work is the opposite sign of regu-
lation of SOS1 target genes in the SHOC2 mutation group, and vice
versa. In this case, despite the fact that both gene products in prin-
ciple positively regulate the RAS-MAPK axis, gene-speciﬁc features
of signal transduction apparently drive opposite transcriptional re-
sponses. A possible explanation for this paradox is that aberrant sig-
naling by a mutated gene can be counteracted by negative feedback
loops that under particular circumstances may account for most
of the transcriptional changes observed at the steady-state level.
According to this view, the PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2 mutation-
associated transcriptomes may be considered not only to directly
report the grade of activity of the RAS-MAPK axis, but also high-
light a more complex transcriptional circuitry that in some cases
may result in opposite changes [Amit et al., 2007].

Downstream of the affected signaling pathways, NS and NS/LAH
gene mutations ultimately drive functional alterations that result
in clinically observable phenotypic traits. Indeed, by looking at the
functions of the proteins encoded by genes included in the various
above-mentioned signatures, we could reconstruct at least some of
the regulatory circuits potentially involved in the molecular patho-
genesis of these disorders. Basic functional keyword enrichment
analysis revealed that many of the genes regulated by PTPN11, SOS1,
and SHOC2 mutations are themselves involved in signal transduc-
tion and control of transcription. Subsequent deeper analyses fo-

Figure 3. Putative circuits of transcriptional regulation in PBMCs
from subjects with NS and NS/LAH. The four drawings summarize the
results of transcription factor and binding site analysis conducted on
lists of genes from the PBMC transcriptional signatures characterizing
the PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2mutation groups. In each drawing, the
oval reports, the mutated gene driving the signature, and the two links
indicate concomitant and signiﬁcant regulation in the same signature of
a transcription factor (top link) and of its putative target genes (bottom
link).

SHOC2 deregulate the RAS-MAPK pathway, each mutated gene
drives speciﬁc perturbations in intracellular signaling leading to
different transcriptomic changes. Leave-one-out analysis conﬁrmed
that such gene-speciﬁc signatures correctly classiﬁed most NS and
NS/LAH patients, which opens the way to potential clinical diag-
nostic application of this approach. Partial overlap was observed
between the PTPN11 mutation-associated transcriptome and in a
mutually exclusive manner, those associated with SOS1 and SHOC2
gene mutations, allowing to deﬁne two PTPN11 subgroups, whose
biological signiﬁcance remains to be elucidated. SOS1 and SHOC2
mutations appeared to drive anticorrelated transcriptional changes.
Interestingly, there was signiﬁcantly more transcriptome perturba-
tion in SHOC2-mutated specimens (1,394 genes) as compared to
PTPN11 and SOS1-mutated samples (223 and 73 genes, respec-
tively). Within the PTPN11 subgroup, no signiﬁcant associations
were found between transcriptional proﬁles and the clinical scoring
system developed by van der Burgt [van der Burgt et al., 1994],
possibly due to the small number of cases analyzed.

The differences highlighted by transcriptional proﬁling were
found to be consistent with the different role of SHP2, SOS1, and
SHOC2 in modulating intracellular signaling. SHP2 is a nonrecep-
tor protein tyrosine phosphatase [Neel et al., 2003] required for

SOS1, and SHOC2. In particular, a higher than expected representa-
tion of substrates of members of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases
(FYN, LYN, LCK, SRC) was observed. This ﬁnding highlights a
complex interplay between mutations in PTPN11, SOS1, and
SHOC2, and this family of kinases known to be involved in signal-
ing through the MAPK cascade [Zhang et al., 2004] and to regulate
fundamental cellular processes such as growth, shape change, and
migration in multiple cell lineages [Parsons and Parsons, 2004].
Based on these ﬁndings, it can be speculated that such an inter-
play could be at the basis of mesenchymal alterations giving rise
to skeletal, cardiac, and hemopoietic abnormalities observed in NS
and other RASopathies. Through a different approach, based on
mining protein–protein interaction databases, we found that a high
fraction of PTPN11 and SHOC2 target genes encode proteins in-
teracting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBL. Intriguingly, germline
CBL mutations have been recently found in a condition with clin-
ical features partially overlapping NS and with predisposition to
hematologic malignancies during childhood, as well as in diverse
myeloproliferative disorders and myeloid leukemias as somatically
acquired lesions [Martinelli et al., 2010; Niemeyer et al., 2010; P´erez
et al., 2010]. Altogether, these results reveal a highly integrated ge-
netic program, whereby biochemical activation of the RAS-MAPK
axis drives transcriptional regulation of a relevant subset of proteins
involved in functionally related signaling networks. In this view,
deeper exploration of transcriptome/interactome connections may
highlight new candidate genes for RASopathies, not yet molecularly
elucidated.

Finally, we focused on TF/target gene circuits modulated by the
PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2 mutations. The most interesting one
involves GFI1 (Growth factor independence 1) that was negatively
modulated in samples with mutated PTPN11 and whose predicted
targets were concordantly downregulated in the same samples. No-
tably, children with NS present increased risk of myeloproliferative
disorder (MPD) [Kratz et al., 2005], and GFI1 loss of function
has been documented to cause MPDs [Khandanpour et al., 2011].
This evidence suggests that GFI1 downmodulation could be causally
linked to MPD susceptibility in NS. In principle, genes differentially
expressed in PBMCs could also be regulated in other tissues, and,
therefore, related to nonhematologic anomalies. As an example,
altered gene expression in the blood has been found to correlate
with Huntington’s disease, a speciﬁc neurodegenerative autosomal
dominant disorder [Runne et al., 2007]. Indeed, GFI1 is also in-
volved in the development of the inner ear hair cells [M¨or¨oy T.,
2005], and its mRNA was robustly downregulated in two indepen-
dent murine models of hearing loss [Hertzano et al., 2004, Lewis
et al., 2009]. In this respect, PTPN11 mutation-driven GFI1 down-
regulation could play a key role in hearing abnormalities observed
in NS [Scheiber et al., 2009; Qiu et al.,1998]. In the SHOC2 signa-
ture, two TFs, CREB1 and SP1 were consistently upregulated, while
their targets resulted to be preferentially downmodulated. CREB1
encodes a 43-kDa basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) TF known to be a tar-
get of the MAPK/ERK pathway [Morgan et al., 2001]. Interestingly,
hippocampi deriving from a knockout mouse model of neuroﬁbro-
matosis presented increased activity of the RAF-ERK axis and of
CREB [Guilding et al., 2007], indicating a possible involvement in
the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment observed in RASopathies.
SP1 belongs to the SP/KLF TF family and is a MAPK target [Be-
nasciutti et al., 2004; Curry et al., 2008]. Interestingly, enhanced SP1
activity has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy, a recurrent cardiac
anomaly in NS [Azakie et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2009].
Finally, the putative GABPA circuit detected in the SOS1 signature is
consistent with the fact that GABPA is a known target of the MAPK
pathway [Flory et al., 1996; Fromm and Burden, 2001]. Altogether,
708

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 33, No. 4, 703–709, 2012

functional data mining focused on signal transduction and TF ac-
tivity highlighted genes and modules of transcriptional regulation
present in the PTPN11, SOS1, and SHOC2 signatures that provide
useful hints on the molecular pathogenesis of NS.

It is likely that current advances in massive sequencing will pave
the way to molecular characterization of all germline mutations
causing RASopathies. In this perspective, the clinical potential of
transcriptional NS signatures will not reside as much on ﬁrst di-
agnosis applications, but rather on its utility as a transcriptional
readout of the actual functional status of the affected tissue. In this
view, the results shown here open the way to exploit PBMC gene
signatures as surrogate markers of speciﬁc MAPK pathway activa-
tion driven by NS gene mutations and, therefore, as a powerful tool
to monitor the biological response to molecular targeted drugs.
