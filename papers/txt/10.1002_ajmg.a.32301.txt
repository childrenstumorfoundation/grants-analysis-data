The Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene functions as a
tumor suppressor gene. Loss of its protein, neuroﬁbromin,
in the autosomal dominant disorder NF1 is associated
with peripheral nervous system tumors, particularly neuro-
ﬁbromas, benign lesions in which the major cell type is the
Schwann Cell (SC). Benign and malignant human tumors
found in NF1 patients are heterogeneous with respect to
their cellular composition. The number and size of neuro-
ﬁbromas in NF1 patients has been shown to increase during
pregnancy, with,

However, in this review, we consider evidence from the

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE I (NF1)

AND TUMOR FORMATION

The tumor suppressor gene, NF1, which encodes
the neuroﬁbromin protein, is responsible for one of
the most common autosomal dominant disorders,
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), affecting 1/3,000
to 1/3,500 individuals worldwide [Friedman et al.,
1999]. Mutations in NF1 are responsible for widely
varying phenotypes,
including benign cutaneous
tumors and numerous benign tumors of the peri-
pheral nervous system such as neuroﬁbromas,
plexiform neuroﬁbromas and optic nerve pathway
gliomas [Viskochil et al., 1993; Gutmann et al., 1994;
Blum and Kambich, 1997; Feldkamp et al., 1998;
Packer et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2002].

Neuroﬁbromas are among the most commonly
found and potentially debilitating manifestations
of NF1. These benign growths, comprised mostly of
Schwann cells (SC), but with substantive numbers of
ﬁbroblasts, mast cells, perineurial cells and vascular
endothelial cells, arise on nerves that range in size
from extremely small terminal branches to the spinal
nerve roots. It is generally thought that SCs are the
primary cells involved in the formation of neuro-

ﬁbromas, although the presence of two SC types,
with and without
loss of heterozygosity (LOH),
suggests that LOH may not be the primary event
triggering neuroﬁbroma formation. Other cell types
with NF1 loss may also be involved in neuroﬁbroma
formation. A major unanswered question is whether
a decrease in neuroﬁbromin as a result of haploin-
sufﬁciency is sufﬁcient
to induce neuroﬁbroma
formation, or whether other mutations, at the NF1
locus or other loci (e.g., P53, retinoblastoma), or
environmental conditions including trauma, altered
blood supply, and the elevated levels of speciﬁc
hormones seen at puberty and during pregnancy, are

necessary triggers [Horyn et al., 1988; Zhu et al., 2002;
Parada et al., 2005].

Individuals with NF1 cite neuroﬁbromas as the
single most signiﬁcant burden of
their disorder
because of their disﬁguring effects and associated
physical and social discomfort [Wolkenstein et al.,
2001; Page et al., 2006]. These tumors are rarely
present at birth, but are found in 48% of 10-year-old
(notably, precocious puberty is a common feature of
NF1) [Virdis et al., 2003], 84% of 20-year-old, and
virtually all NF1 patients over the age of 40. It has
been reported [Karvonen et al., 2000] that many
tiny neuroﬁbromas have been found in the normal-
looking skin of NF1 patients,
indicating a more
widespread occurrence than was previously under-
stood. Large neuroﬁbromas can also arise from
multiple nerves within plexuses, termed plexiform
neuroﬁbromas [Packer et al., 2002].

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas, generally ﬁrst arising
in early childhood, are often relatively stable for a
number of years, but are capable of aggressive
growth, particularly as puberty approaches or during
pregnancy. Diffuse plexiform neuroﬁbromas are
frequently associated with signiﬁcant morbidity
and even mortality. The presence of benign plexi-
form neuroﬁbroma elements in soft tumors is com-
monly used by pathologists to make a diagnosis of
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in
a soft tissue tumor. There are enough histopatho-
logical dissimilarities among discrete, nodular, and
diffuse plexiform neuroﬁbromas to suggest
that
different mechanisms exist for the formation of these
different types of neuroﬁbromas [Palmer et al., 2004].

NF1 IN A CHANGING HORMONAL

MILIEU: PREGNANCY

The incidence of pregnancy among NF1 patients is
relatively low and is inversely correlated with the
severity of the disease, from about 1/5,000 to about
1/18,000 obstetrical patients has NF1, compared with
the 1/3,000 to 1/3,500 overall NF1 incidence in live
births [Blickstein et al., 1988; Weissman et al., 1993].
Obstetrical complications are important considera-
tions for NF1-affected women of childbearing age,
particularly in certain societal and third-world
countries [Blum and Kambich, 1997]. Many have
speculated that the number and size of the neuro-
ﬁbromas may increase in response to hormonal
stimuli as commonly described by women during
pregnancy [Posma et al., 2003], but a direct correla-
tion of neuroﬁbroma growth and hormonal stimula-
tion remains to be elucidated.

Blickstein et al. [1988] and Blum and Kambich
[1997] speculate that women with very mild cases
of NF1 are frequently not diagnosed and their
disorder either does not complicate pregnancy or,
if symptoms worsen during the pregnancy, NF1 is
then diagnosed. They further comment that women

with severe clinical manifestations of NF1 rarely
elect to bear children except in underdeveloped
countries. There has been a reported increase in the
number and size of cutaneous and plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas with pregnancy going back over 100 years
[Brickner, 1906; Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996; Blum
and Kambich, 1997; Isikoglu et al., 2002; Posma
et al., 2003]. There have also been reports that
pregnant NF1 patients with giant ‘‘royal’’ tumors are
more affected than patients with only nodular
tumors, with possible reciprocal effects between
NF1 and pregnancy [Blickstein et al., 1988]. The
earliest obstetrical description of NF1,
termed
‘‘ﬁbroma molluscum gravidarum’’ was in 1906, by
Brickner, while the adverse association between NF1
and pregnancy was ﬁrst recognized by Hirst in 1911
[Brickner, 1906; Blickstein et al., 1988].

Only two studies of NF1 patients during pregnancy
involve relatively large numbers of patients
[Weiss-
man et al., 1993; Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996]. These
writers cite studies that suggest that NF1 patients have
low marriage rates due to cosmetic disﬁgurement or
may voluntarily choose to remain childless [Blickstein
et al., 1988; Blum and Kambich, 1997]. The Dugoff and
Sujansky study [Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996] reported
on 105 women and 180 pregnancies: 60% of patients
reported growth of new neuroﬁbromas; 52% experi-
enced enlargement of existing neuroﬁbromas, some-
times with a decrease in size of nodules after delivery.
However, multiparous women who had NF1 experi-
enced new growth of neuroﬁbromas only in some
pregnancies [Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996]. This obser-
vation is possibly due to mild cases remaining
undiagnosed or severe cases more subject to report.
The Weissman report [Weissman et al., 1993] was
based on 34 pregnancies in nine NF1 patients; fertility
did not seem to be impaired in women with NF1.
However, this study found a higher than expected rate
of ﬁrst trimester spontaneous abortions (20.7%), still
births (8.7%) and intrauterine growth retardation
(13.0%), which were not seen or possibly not reported
in the Colorado study [Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996].
Additional studies have also reported growth retarda-
tion of the fetus in patients with NF1 [Belton et al., 1984;
Blickstein and Lancet, 1987; Blum and Kambich, 1997].
Malignant degeneration of neuroﬁbromas during
pregnancy has also been reported [Ginsburg et al.,
1981; Baker et al., 1989; Puls and Chandler, 1991;
Posma et al., 2003], as well as maternal death
from an intracranial hemorrhage resulting from a
glioblastoma that recurred during pregnancy [Hadi,
1995]. A second pregnancy resulted in the over-
growth of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor that
had initially arisen during a ﬁrst pregnancy, which
proved fatal to the patient [Posma et al., 2003].
Another case report found that a patient with initially
mild disease symptoms died of the results of multiple
malignancies, which the physician believed arose
and became worse during and after pregnancy

and delivery [Heffner 1969]. A combination of CNS
tumor enlargement, new tumor appearance, hydro-
cephalus and hypertension in a pregnant patient with
NF1 [Boiten et al., 1987] has also been reported.

In patients with NF1, pregnancy can cause severe
hypertension and/or blood vessel weakness. An
increased risk of hypertension has been recognized
in all adults with NF1, but severe hypertension has
been speciﬁcally noted in pregnant patients with
NF1 [Wiznitzer et al., 1986; Bertrand et al., 1992;
Hagymasy et al., 1998] including some earlier studies
of patients whose pregnancies had to be terminated
because of
life-threatening conditions [Edwards
et al., 1983]. At least one case was found in which
the undiagnosed NF1 led to fatal complications
under anesthesia [Humble, 1967]. There have also
been reports in the literature of blood vessel rupture
during pregnancy in NF1 patients, including a report
of a patient with fatal renal artery rupture [Tapp and
Hickling, 1969] and another NF1 patient whose arm
was amputated after brachial artery rupture [Tidwell
and Copas, 1998]. However, at least one report [Jarvis
and Crompton, 1978] of a study of hypertension
in 10 pregnant patients with NF1 in the course of
27 pregnancies found only two cases of pre-
eclampsia, a still birth and four spontaneous
abortions but the majority of pregnancies reported
no evidence of hypertension; the number of hyper-
tensive NF1 patients was also reportedly low in
one study [Weissman et al., 1993], and no excessive
hypertension was reported in the [Dugoff and
Sujansky, 1996] study. No record was made of the
patients’ lesions, however, or whether they were
affected by the pregnancies. Another study that
attempted to relate hypertension to the number of
neuroﬁbromas found that development of hyper-
tension and poor outcome in NF1 pregnancies is
directly proportional to the number of lesions found
in the patient [Sharma et al., 1991].

Prospective studies, such as those cited above,
involved patients with relatively mild forms of the
disorder whose pregnancies were obstetrically
uneventful, even if there are reported increases in
size and number of their neuroﬁbromas [Dugoff
and Sujansky, 1996]. In contrast, a large number
of retrospective case studies by obstetricians and
gynecologists tend to involve only a few women
[Ansari and Nagamani, 1976] or even single patients
[Ribella, 1975] and report severe, and therefore
particularly notable, effects.

Essentially all of these studies, both large and small,
are descriptive, providing no signiﬁcant insight to the
pathogenesis of disease progression. None of these
reports presents a functional study of the mechanism
of new lesion growth or
the enlargement of
preexisting lesions during pregnancy. One study
done on both male and non-pregnant female neuro-
ﬁbroma tumors found 75% expressed progesterone
receptor (PR), while 5% expressed estrogen receptor

(ER) [McLaughlin and Jacks, 2003]. Both male and
female tumor cells were tested, but whether sex of
the patient affected the levels of PR and ER
expression was not reported. A recent report by
Fishbein et al. [2007] investigated the potential role of
pregnancy steroid hormone action on the growth,
proliferation and tumorigenicity of cells that do or do
not express the NF1 gene or its protein product,
neuroﬁbromin. It is the ﬁrst published study of RNA
levels of steroid hormone receptors in primary NF1
tumor cells, Schwann Cell (SC)-enriched NF1 tumor
cells and normal SC, along with an analysis of
proliferation and apoptosis. This study found hetero-
geneity among the cell types, regardless of tumor
origin or gender, suggesting the importance of the
individual
[Fishbein
et al., 2007]. We have recently published an addi-
tional study [Roth et al., 2008], in which a mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with varying levels of
neuroﬁbromin were differentiated into Schwann-
like cells and proliferation in response to hormones
was compared to that in human NF1 cell lines derived
from malignant or benign tumors. Although estrogen

We put forward the hypothesis that hormones,
particularly those that increase during pregnancy
acting on cells that lack neuroﬁbromin, are respon-
sible for the observed increase in both size and
numbers of cutaneous and plexiform neuroﬁbromas
in pregnant patients with NF1.

THE HORMONAL MILIEU DURING PREGNANCY
Steroid hormones, such as 17b-estradiol (E2),
progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T), are derived
from cholesterol precursors, with P4 synthesized
ﬁrst, followed by T, which is a precursor for E2,
which is converted to E2 through the aromatase
enzyme [Gao et al., 2005] (Fig. 1). In non-pregnant
women, steroid hormones are primarily synthesized
by the ovary. Concentrations of
these steroid
hormones
are upregulated during pregnancy
[Witorsch 2002; Fernandez-Valdivia et al., 2005;
Okada et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Cuenca et al., 2006;
Gardner et al., 2007]. In early pregnancy, the corpus
luteum produces these hormones, but the placenta is
the dominant source of steroid hormones by the
seventh gestational week [Gardner et al., 2007].

All placental-produced steroids are derived from
maternal or
fetal cholesterol precursor steroids
[Gardner et al., 2007]. Progesterone (P4) uses maternal

progesterone receptor
et al., 2005; Boonyaratanakornkit and Edwards,
2007]. The PR is regulated by E2 by transactivation
through the ER [Fernandez-Valdivia et al., 2005;
Okada et al., 2005]. Steroids can cross-react and bind
to receptors other than their native receptor, because
of the similarity of the receptor conformation, even
though the actual sequence identity may be low [Gao
et al., 2005]. Testosterone is the primary circulating
androgen, even in women, and is the ligand for the
androgen receptor (AR), although it can also cross-
react with both the ER and PR at low afﬁnity [Gao
et al., 2005; Boonyaratanakornkit and Edwards,
2007]. Steroid receptors (ER, PR, and AR) belong to
the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors,
which are activated when their ligand (E2, P4 or T)
binds to the nuclear-envelope-anchored receptor
and the complex subsequently enters the nucleus to
bind to hormone response elements (HRE) in gene
promoter regions, thereby activating transcription
of downstream effector genes [Fernandez-Valdivia
et al., 2005; Boonyaratanakornkit and Edwards 2007;
Gavrilova-Jordan and Price 2007] (Fig. 2). Tumor
cells which express both ER and PR have a better
prognosis because they are more likely to respond to
hormone treatment [Jacobsen et al., 2003], although
tumors that express only ER or PR, but not both, have
been reported to have a poorer outcome [Jacobsen
et al., 2005].

However, steroid hormone action is not mediated
exclusively through classical pathways [McEwen
and Alves, 1999; Ho and Liao, 2002; Zhang et al.,
2004; Chen et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2005; Jacobsen
et al., 2005; Revankar et al., 2005; Sonneveld et al.,
2006; Gavrilova-Jordan and Price, 2007]. There
have been reports of steroid hormones (P4, E2, T)
inﬂuencing cells independently of their classical
receptors (PR, ER, AR) [McEwen and Alves, 1999; Ho
and Liao, 2002; Zhang et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005;
Gao et al., 2005; Jacobsen et al., 2005; Revankar et al.,
2005; Sonneveld et al., 2006; Gavrilova-Jordan and
Price, 2007]. Conversely, the receptors have also
been shown to exert their inﬂuence without hor-
mones [Chen et al., 2005; Jacobsen et al., 2005;
Sonneveld et al., 2006]. ER expression has been seen
outside the nucleus [McEwen and Alves, 1999;
Ho and Liao, 2002; Zhang et al., 2004; Revankar
et al., 2005]. E2 has also been shown to modu-

FIG. 1. Steroid hormone synthesis. The steroid hormones progesterone,
testosterone, and 17b-estradiol are upregulated during pregnancy. All of these
steroid hormones are originally synthesized from cholesterol and converted to
the respective hormones through enzymatic action. Steroid hormones are
ligands for classical steroid receptors that activate downstream genes,
promoting proliferation and differentiation. Progesterone is the ligand for the
progesterone receptor, estrogen for the estrogen receptor, and testosterone for
the androgen receptor, although they can also cross-react with lower afﬁnity.
There are also other, non-classical steroid hormone pathways that allow for
quick response to hormonal stimulation through secondary messengers and
small G-proteins. [Color Fig. can be viewed in the online issue, which is

cholesterol as a substrate, while 17b-estradiol (E2)
depends on both maternal and fetal sources. Most
E2 is derived from testosterone (T) precursors, which
are also increased during normal pregnancy. Plasma
concentrations of E2, P4 and T hormones inc-
rease progressively throughout pregnancy (Table I)
[Gardner et al., 2007]. After birth, steroid hormone
levels decline rapidly,
falling to pre-pregnancy
follicular stage levels within 1–3 days [Gardner et al.,
2007].

E2 has been shown to be involved in cell
proliferation, and is a ligand for the estrogen receptor
(ER) [Revankar et al., 2005; Boonyaratanakornkit
and Edwards, 2007]. P4 modiﬁes E2 and is involved in
both proliferation and differentiation [Fernandez-

FIG. 2. Steroid hormone pathways. In the classical pathway (left side), steroid hormones bind to classical receptors in the cell, where they induce conformational
changes. The steroid/receptor complex then translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes, binds to genes via transcription factors and hormone response elements and
activates transcription, leading to protein production and cellular responses. In the non-classical pathway (middle), membrane-bound or cytoplasmic steroid receptors
associate with signaling molecules. Neuroﬁbromin’s most well-characterized function is as a Ras-GAP tumor suppressor. Following ligand/receptor binding and the
resulting signal, neuroﬁbromin accelerates the hydrolyzation of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP, thus turning off multiple downstream signaling cascades, such as
PI3K and MAPK. When the NF1 gene is missing or mutated, neuroﬁbromin is not available to shut down these pathways, leaving them constitutively active. This can
result in uncontrolled cell growth and formation of peripheral nerve tumors called neuroﬁbromas. In the steroid receptor-independent pathway (right side), novel G
protein-coupled receptors that are unrelated to classical nuclear steroid receptors, mediate rapid, non-genomic signaling cascades through adenylate cyclase inhibition,
cAMP production and MAPK activation. Other transcription factors are also involved in these pathways. [Color Fig. can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
at www.interscience. wiley.com.]

and activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways
[Ho and Liao, 2002; Boonyaratanakornkit and
Edwards, 2007; Gavrilova-Jordan and Price, 2007].
These effects are not inhibited by ER inhibitors,
suggesting they are not mediated through the
classical receptors [Ho and Liao, 2002] (Fig. 2).

The most potent hormone effector in pregnancy
is estrogen in the form of 17b-estradiol (E2). It
promotes the proliferation of endometrial cells in the
uterus, and is essential for maintaining pregnancy. It
is initially produced by the corpus luteum and
later by the placenta [Gardner et al., 2007]. Additional
estradiol species are also produced,
including
17aestradiol (also called 17aE2), which is a weak
estrogen, and induces some estrogen responsive
genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)
that promotes angiogenesis-new blood
vessel formation. However, its action in rat pituitary
tumor cells is independent of the estrogen receptors

(ER), and instead acts through the PI3Kinase-AKT
signaling pathway. There is evidence that this is also
the pathway through which neuroﬁbromin acts
[Klesse and Parada 1998].

E2 also has proliferative effects on estrogen-
responsive tumor cells. It has been demonstrated
[Ahmad et al., 1999] that in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma
cell line, E2 upregulates AKT activity and increases cell
proliferation. Both the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI)
and wortmannin (the PI3K inhibitor) block this
effect [Ahmad et al., 1999]. In addition, it has been
demonstrated [Wilson et al., 2002]
that estradiol
treatment reduced the number of neuronal cells
undergoing apoptotic cell death. These authors
examined the level of activation of Akt kinase that
mediates the anti-apoptotic signals. Explants treated
with estradiol had elevated levels of pAkt and
treatment with ICI prevented the effect of estradiol,
suggesting that estradiol prevents injury-induced

apoptosis in neurons and that Akt activation is
probably responsible for this effect [Wilson et al.,
2002]. Although the evidence at this time is only
circumstantial, there is a good possibility that the two
pathways,
the NF1-dependent pathway and the
estrogen-dependent pathway both interact through
effects on PI3 Kinase.

Progesterone, which is also critical for maintaining
pregnancy, is also increasingly produced during the
course of pregnancy [Gardner et al., 2007]. P4 can be
involved in cell differentiation and modulation of E2
proliferative effects. E2 and P4 can have comple-
mentary functions, with P4 inhibiting the ER [Jacob-
sen et al., 2003; Gardner et al., 2007]. An increase in
E2:P4 ratio may be a factor in initiating labor [Gardner
et al., 2007]. P4 and E2 can be used in combination
to stimulate tumor development by simulating
pregnancy in mice with dormant mammary tumors
[Gattelli et al., 2004]. The combination of E2 and P4
caused the tumor cells to break dormancy and begin
proliferating.

forms of

There are two distinct

the estrogen
receptor (ER), ERa and ERb, which are transcribed
from different genes [Boonyaratanakornkit and
Edwards, 2007]. Both subtypes bind estrogens as
well as selective ER modiﬁers (SERMs) including
the anti-cancer agent
tamoxifen and a number
of other anti-cancer ER inhibitors [Cummings,
2002; Boonyaratanakornkit and Edwards, 2007]. ER
receptors are classically located in the nucleus
although they can also be located in the nuclear or
mitochondrial membrane [Gavrilova-Jordan and
Price, 2007]. PR, as well as AR, have also been found
on mitochondrial membranes, and are very similar/
identical to nuclear steroid receptors [Gavrilova-
Jordan and Price, 2007].

ICI 182,780 at 10

Classical steroid receptors form dimers, interact
with basal transcription factors and coactivators and
bind to hormone response elements (HRE) in DNA,
leading to the modulation of target gene trans-
cription. The distribution of the ER and PR subtypes
varies among tissues and among cells in a speciﬁc
tissue, and their expression also varies during
development [Van Den Bemd et al., 1999; Boonyar-
atanakornkit and Edwards, 2007].
 7 M is a pure antiestrogen that
leads to the downregulation and subsequent loss of
the estrogen receptors themselves [Wakeling et al.,
1991; Van Den Bemd et al., 1999; Cicatiello et al.,
2000]. It also has estrogen receptor antagonistic
effects and inhibits estrogen binding to both the
a and b forms of the human estrogen receptor (ER)
[Robertson et al., 2001; Garnier et al., 2003]. ICI has
been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer
cells and cell lines [Robertson et al., 2001]. It has
also been shown to be effective against tamoxifen-
resistant breast cancer in post-menopausal women
[Robertson et al., 2001]. ICI induces a conformational
change in the ER and induces a ligand concentration-

dependent increase in proteolytic degradation. ICI
has anti-progestin effects in a human breast cancer
cell line, blocking progesterone responsive genes
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
which is a potent angiogenic growth factor [Hyder
and Stancel, 2002]. ICI blocked progestin-induced
VEGF mRNA and protein synthesis [Hyder and
Stancel, 2002], although it did not block binding of
progestin to the PR or down-regulate the endoge-
nous PR. Estrogen does not upregulate VEGF in these
breast cancer cells. Therefore ICI could block angio-
genesis in the breast cancer cell
line through a
mechanism unrelated to its ER inhibition and the
authors suggest that either ICI binds to a site in the PR
different from its ligand binding site and/or ICI binds
to a co-activator or co-repressor or to yet another
protein involved in the transcriptional complex
associated with par responsive genes such as VEGF.
ICI also effectively inhibits the ER in the hippo-
campus but not the frontal cortex of the brain [Mize
et al., 2003]. Studies in both rodents and primates
have shown that progestins can counteract
the
antiatherogenic effects of estrogens. ICI inhibits
these effects demonstrating that the antiatherogenic
effects of E2 are mediated through the ER and studies
with ER knockout mice also demonstrate that ERs
mediate these protective effects of estrogen on the
vasculature [Karas, 2002].

2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a natural estrogen
metabolite of E2 that has no estrogenic effects itself
but has both antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic
effects [Fotsis et al., 1994; Lin et al., 2001; Schumacher
and Neuhaus, 2001; Carothers et al., 2002], including
effects on osteosarcoma [Maran et al., 2002] and
Ewing sarcoma [Djavaheri-Mergny et al., 2003]. Both
microvasculature and large vessel endothelial cell
proliferation are also blocked by 2ME2 [Fotsis et al.,
1994]. Proliferation of many types of normal cells,
including thyroid cells [Wang et al., 2000] and
chondrocytes in the growth plate [Sibonga et al.,
2002] are inhibited by 2ME2. However, 2ME2-
induced apoptosis is independent of the estrogen
receptors a and b [LaVallee et al., 2002]. Analogues
of 2ME2 have been made and tested for their
enhanced inhibitory abilities and one analogue,
14-Dehydro-2-ME-2, was 16-fold more potent than
2-ME2 against various tumor cell lines, including
prostate cancer cell lines [Tinley et al., 2003]. An
important study of 2ME2 demonstrated that 2ME2,
which has only weak afﬁnity for the ER, not only
has antiproliferative activity but also alters tubulin
dynamics [Brueggemeier et al., 2001]. A variant of this
metabolite, 2-methoxymethylestradiol, was more
effective than the native metabolite in producing
cytotoxicity and altering tubulin dynamics in intact
cells [Brueggemeier et al., 2001].

During pregnancy, 2ME2 may put a growth check
on estrogen-stimulated cell growth. We hypothesize
that (1) levels of both estrogens and 2ME2 may be

different in women with NF1 from those in women
without NF1 and (2) 2ME2 levels might be lower in
NF1 patients. If 2ME2 levels are lower in individuals
with NF1,
it may be unable to compensate for
estrogen levels that promote the growth of neuro-
ﬁbromas and might also be involved in the con-
version of benign to malignant tumors that has also
been reported in some pregnant NF1 patients [Posma
et al., 2003]. However, there are no studies in the
literature examining the levels of hormones or
hormone metabolites in the pregnant women with
NF1. Furthermore, most of the studies published to
date about women with NF1 are descriptive. There
are no studies of the mechanism by which any of
these hormones or metabolites act on cells that do or
do not make neuroﬁbromin.

POSSIBLE ROLE OF STEROIDS IN HYPERTENSION
AND VASCULAR STRUCTURE ALTERATIONS SEEN

IN PREGNANT PATIENTS WITH NF1

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a
major inducer of tumor angiogenesis [Ruohola et al.,
1999]. It is expressed in endothelial cells, and its
expression in cancer cells, such as breast cancer cells,
indicates a poor prognosis for tumor progression.
Neuroﬁbromas tend to be highly vascular [Thomas
and De Vries, 2007]. 17bestradiol (E2) upregulates
VEGF mRNA in many cancer cells [Ruohola et al.,
1999],
ICI
inhibits the E2-mediated upregulation indicating that
it is probably an ER-dependent mechanism [Ruohola
et al., 1999]. In contrast, tamoxifen also upregulates
VEGF mRNA on its own and has no inhibitory effect
such as that of ICI [Ruohola et al., 1999].

leading to subsequent angiogenesis.

E2 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell prolifer-
ation whereas ICI causes proliferation of these cells
[Lavigne et al., 1999]. It has also been reported that
short-term exposure to pharmacological levels of
17a or 17b-estradiol (E2) produced relaxation in pig
coronary artery in organ culture [Teoh et al., 1999].
However, physiological concentrations of estradiol
also enhanced the endothelium-independent relax-
ation of pig coronary artery produced by other
agents. This relaxation was not blocked either by
tamoxifen or by ICI, suggesting that the effect is
mediated through a different ER and that E2 may be
responsible for acute effects on blood ﬂow by a
different mechanism than that involved in ER down-
regulation. Additional effects on the blood system
include effects on the integrity of the endothelial cell
lining of blood vessels that is affected by E2 [Cho
et al., 1998]. Tight junctions between the endothelial
cells are critically important for maintaining the
integrity of the blood vasculature. E2 increases the
cation speciﬁcity of the tight junctions. In addition,
E2 also acts as an antioxidant at the genomic level. By
balance; E2 keeps the

for maintaining
occlusion of the paracellular space in endothelial
cells by tight junctions [Cho et al., 1998]. If extra-
cellular calcium is lowered, cells separate, weaken-
ing blood vessel walls, which eventually leads
to rupture [Cho et al., 1998]. Estrogen modulates
tight
junctional resistance across the endothelial
cells [Teoh et al., 1999]. Estrogen increases the tight
junctional permeability to ions [Teoh et al., 1999]. A
nuclear receptor, but probably not the ER, mediates
the effect of estrogen on cation selectivity [Revankar
et al., 2005].

POSSIBLE HORMONAL INVOLVEMENT IN

MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION

It has been postulated that hormones are involved
in the progression of benign lesions (neuroﬁbromas)
to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNST) [Fishbein et al., 2007]. A recent study
describes RNA levels of steroid hormone receptors,
along with the effects of
the steroid hormones
progesterone (P4), estrogen (E2), or testosterone
(T) on primary and SC-enriched human benign and
malignant NF tumor cell
lines and normal SC
[Fishbein et al., 2007]. Fishbein et al. [2007] found a
great deal of heterogeneity in estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor
expression in normal SC and most NF1 tumor
samples tested, with no clear division based on
tumor type or gender. The greatest variation in
hormone receptor levels occurred between primary
tumor cells versus SC-enriched tumor cell cultures,
suggesting that cell types other than the SC have
steroid hormone receptors. There were also some
statistically signiﬁcant differences in proliferation
and apoptosis in cells exposed to steroid hormones
or their antagonists, but these differences were also
heterogeneous. These data did not ﬁt into a simplistic
or global model to explain the functional role of
hormonal pathways in the progression of NF1;
however, they suggest that the surrounding cells
unique to each tumor’s microenvironment were
important to tumorigenicity, and that classical steroid
receptor effects may only apply to a subset of NF1
tumors, regardless of gender [Fishbein et al., 2007].
Our own studies of Schwann Cell-like (SC-like)
differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)
that have been engineered to lack neuroﬁbromin are
consistent with this ﬁnding [Roth et al., 2007, 2008].
mESC, as well as NF1-

POSTULATED INTERACTIONS OF NF1,

ESTROGENS AND APOPTOSIS PATHWAYS

We hypothesize that hormones inﬂuence NF1-
mediated apoptotic events through the phosphati-
dylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, which has been
implicated in NF1 signal
transduction [Yao and
Cooper, 1995; Klippel et al., 1996; Rodriguez-Viciana
et al., 1996; Kulik et al., 1997; Parrizas and LeRoith,
1997; Stokoe et al., 1997; Crowder and Freeman,
1998; Klesse and Parada, 1998; Klesse et al., 1999]. A
report also suggests that the PI3K cascade mediates
the neuroprotective effects of estrogen on cortical
neurons [Honda et al., 2000], making this hypothesis
even more attractive to test.

Over the past decade, the NF1 community of
researchers has gained signiﬁcant insight into the
genetic mechanisms underlying NF1. However,
to date the hormonal pathways modulating NF1
phenotypes have not been well elucidated. Over
the years patients with NF1 have reported a dramatic
change in tumor number and size during puberty as
well as pregnancy suggesting hormonal regulation of
tumor growth. While the possibility that some cells in
the tumors are hormone-responsive has always
been viewed as quite plausible given our recogni-
tion of hormonal responsiveness of many tumor
types, little scientiﬁc evidence has supported this
clinical observation. Recently, new insights into
the hormonal regulation of neuroﬁbromas’ growth
have been reported as summarized above. Further
studies into the molecular mechanisms delineating
how hormonal stimulation regulates neuroﬁbroma
growth are necessary to provide a more accurate
understanding of the natural history of the condition,
and lead to the development of innovative tools for
the management of patients who have NF1. Recog-
nition by clinicians of the hormonal impact of NF1 is
essential to provide care of patients. Ideally, further
knowledge about the pathways and modifying facts
of NF1 will be instrumental in the improving the
prognostic and therapeutic management of
the
disease as well.
