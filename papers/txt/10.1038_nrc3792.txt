Preface

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is over-expressed and 
activated in several advanced-stage solid cancers. FAK promotes tumor progression and 
metastasis through effects on cancer cells, as well as stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment. 
FAK’s kinase-dependent and –independent functions control cell movement, invasion, survival, 
gene expression, and cancer stem cell self-renewal. Small molecule FAK inhibitors decrease 
tumor growth and metastasis in several preclinical models and possess initial clinical activity in 
patients with limited adverse events. We discuss FAK signaling effects on both tumor and stromal 
cell biology that provide rationale and support for future therapeutic opportunities.

Introduction

Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a multi-functional regulator of cell signaling within the 
tumor microenvironment1–3. During development and in various tumors, FAK promotes cell 
motility, survival and proliferation through kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. 
In the past few years, phase I and II clinical trials have been initiated with FAK inhibitors; 
yet, some of FAK’s functions in tumorigenesis remain under investigation.

Chromosomal region 8q24.3, which encompasses PTK2 (encoding FAK), is linked to 
ovarian cancer susceptibility4. Large databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas show that 
FAK mRNA levels are elevated in serous ovarian tumors (~37%)5 and invasive breast 
cancers (~26%)6 with correlations to poor overall patient survival7, 8. Increased FAK mRNA 
levels are also found in several other human malignancies (Figure 1A)3. Studies with tumor 
tissue arrays find that FAK activation, as determined by phosphospecific antibody 
recognition of the FAK tyrosine (Y) 397 auto-phosphorylation site, increases with tumor 
progression3. However, unlike classical oncogenes such as Ras or PI3-kinase (PI3K), only a 
few missense mutations within PTK2 are found in tumors5. Instead, elevated FAK activity is

associated with PTK2 amplification, consistent with a model whereby increased FAK 
dimerization induced by higher FAK levels contributes to catalytic activation9.

Here, we discuss advances in understanding FAK signaling connections in tumor and 
stromal cells. We cover the intricate roles of FAK in tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis. 
We highlight genetic mouse models used to elucidate new roles for FAK in endothelial cells 
(ECs) and discuss how stromal FAK signaling contributes to tumor progression. Finally, we 
summarize new translational developments using small molecule FAK inhibitors.

FAK regulation

Control of FAK expression

Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and p53 are well-characterized transcription factors that activate 
and repress the PTK2 promoter, respectively10, 11. Other transcription factors such as 
Nanog12, Argonaute2 (Ago2)13, and PEA314 also increase PTK2 promoter activity. Nanog 
promotes FAK expression in colon carcinoma cells and as part of a signaling loop, Nanog 
activity is increased by FAK phosphorylation12. Ago2, a part of the cellular RNA 
interference machinery, is amplified in hepatocellular carcinoma and induces FAK 
transcription13. Ago2-silencing reduces FAK levels and concomitantly blocks tumorigenesis 
and metastasis in mice. Elevated PEA3 and FAK levels correlate with metastatic stages in 
human oral squamous cell carcinoma14. PEA3 induces FAK expression in vitro and 
silencing of either PEA3 or FAK reduces metastasis of human melanoma xenografts. Given 
the complexity and size of the PTK2 promoter region, it is likely that transcription factor 
combinatorial effects regulate PTK2 transcription.

FAK is also subject to alternative splicing as PTK2 with deletion of exon 33 (FAK amino 
acids 956–982), identified in a subset of breast and thyroid patient samples, results in 
enhanced cell motility and invasion15. However, this deletion likely disrupts FAK linkage to 
integrins and it is unclear how truncated FAK may function. PTK2 with deletion of exon 26, 
also occurring in breast cancer, removes a FAK C-terminal domain caspase cleavage site 
and results in increased FAK protein stability and anti-apoptotic signaling16. Interestingly, 
alternative splicing or increased FAK mRNA expression does not always translate into 
elevated FAK protein levels17. FAK mRNA turnover mediated by microRNA-7 blocks 
orthotopic breast carcinoma growth and lung metastasis in mice, and microRNA-7 
expression in breast cancer patient samples inversely correlates to cancer stage18. At the 
protein level, FAK is subject to proteasomal or calpain-mediated degradation19. Poly-
ubiquitination by the E3 ligase mitsugumin 53 (also known as TRIM72) promotes FAK 
proteasomal degradation during myogenesis, but this has not been tested in tumor cells20. 
However, in general, FAK protein levels are elevated in advanced stage solid tumors. 
Together, these results support the notion that elevated FAK expression is connected to 
several tumor-associated phenotypes.

Regulation of FAK activity

FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that associates with receptors at the plasma membrane 
and with distinct protein complexes in the nucleus21. Elucidating the regulatory 
mechanism(s) of how FAK associates with these distinct signaling complexes is key to

understanding FAK biological function. FAK domain structure (Figure 1B) consists of an N-
terminal FERM (band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin) domain, a central kinase region, proline-
rich domains, and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting domain2, 19. Proline-rich tyrosine 
kinase 2 (Pyk2), a FAK ortholog with ~45% amino acid sequence identity, can compensate 
for some FAK functions after FAK loss in knockout (KO) mouse models (Box 1)22–24.

Box 1

Commonalities and differences between Pyk2 and FAK

Proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2) shares a similar domain organization with focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK) (see figure), with 60% sequence identity in the central kinase 
domain, and the conserved arrangement of proline-rich regions (PRRs) and tyrosine 
phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of Pyk2 Y402 and Y881 create Src-homology-2 
(SH2) binding sites for Src and growth-factor-receptor-bound-2 (GRB2), respectively. 
Pyk2 and FAK contain C-terminal focal adhesion (FA) targeting (FAT) domains that 
bind to paxillin19, 136. However, Pyk2 shows peri-nuclear distribution and, unlike FAK, 
is not strongly localized to FAs. Substitution of the Pyk2 C-terminal domain with that of 
FAK facilitates co-localization of a Pyk2-FAK chimera to β1 integrin-containing FA, 
indicating that there are significant binding differences between FAK and Pyk219. For 
instance, the FAK FAT domain uniquely binds the integrin-associated protein talin3. 
Although Pyk2 can be activated by integrins, this is highly dependent on Src activation. 
Upon FAK KO in fibroblasts, increased Pyk2 levels induce an intrinsic mechanism 
promoting cell survival23. Consistent with findings in ovarian carcinoma cells, this is in 
part mediated through nuclear translocation and selective regulation of the p53 tumor 
suppressor by Pyk2. Phosphorylation of Pyk2 Y881 has been proposed as a prognostic 
marker for non-small-cell lung cancer progression137. In this cancer type, Pyk2 is 
positively correlated to the expression of cancer stem cell markers, indicating a possible 
mode of action. In glioblastoma cells, Pyk2 is regulated by a specific microRNA, 
miR-23b, that does not target FAK138 and supports the idea of differential Pyk2 and FAK 
functions. Pyk2 signaling upon FAK knockout has also been linked to increased Rho 
GTPase activation22, facilitation of angiogenesis24, regulation of macrophage motility101, 
and control of tumorigenic outgrowth mediated by mammary cancer stem cells139. Due 
to these functions, Pyk2 activity could compromise the outcome of FAK-targeted 
therapy; indeed FAK-selective inhibitors have been shown to enhance Pyk2 tyrosine 
phosphorylation in endothelial cells24.

The best-characterized mechanism promoting FAK activation involves integrin receptor 
clustering upon cell binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins which may involve FAK 
dimerization9. This leads to FAK auto-phosphorylation at Y397, binding of Src-family 
kinases to the phosphorylated site, Src-mediated phosphorylation of the FAK kinase domain 
activation loop (Y576/577), and formation of an activated FAK-Src complex1–3. Indirect

interactions between the FAK C-terminal domain and integrins at focal adhesions (FAs) 
mediate the integrin/FAK linkage, as over-expression of a FAK C-terminal fragment blocks 
integrin-mediated FAK activation19. Alternatively, the activation loop within the FAK 
kinase domain is also directly phosphorylated by the RET receptor, thereby enhancing FAK 
kinase activity25. FAK phosphorylation at Y397 can also occur in trans9.

Recent studies show that FAK FERM domain plays a prominent role in the intra-molecular 
regulation of FAK activity by binding to the kinase domain and blocking FAK Y397 site 
accessibility and auto-phosphorylation21, 26, 27. Studies with a fluorescent biosensor 
revealed FAK FERM conformational changes upon phosphoinositide lipid interaction and 
upon cell binding to ECM27, 28. FAK FERM domain interaction with membrane-associated 
proteins such as tetraspan TM4SF5 or growth factor receptors can also induce FAK 
activation29, 30. FAK activity is also increased via FAK FERM domain alterations induced 
by changes in pH and increased cell-ECM tension31–34. Local pH increases promote FERM 
conformational changes via His58 deprotonation, mediated in part by plasma membrane 
sodium/hydrogen transporters like NHE132. Increased intracellular pH commonly occurs in 
cancer and increased matrix stiffness or forces associated with collagen fiber cross-linking 
trigger increase FAK Y397 phosphorylation and tumor progression in mouse breast cancer 
models32, 33. It is likely that context-dependent stimuli trigger FAK activation through steps 
involving the FERM domain, FAK dimerization, or other yet to be determined mechanisms.

FAK in tumor cells

FAK is at the intersection of various signaling pathways promoting cancer growth and 
metastasis (Figure 2). This includes kinase-dependent control of cell motility19, invasion35, 
cell survival11, 36, and transcriptional events promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)37–39. Additionally, kinase-independent scaffolding functions of FAK can influence 
cell survival or breast cancer stem cell proliferation11, 40, 41. Understanding the balance 
between kinase-dependent and -independent functions is key to the interpretation of FAK-
related phenotypes. Conditional tissue-specific FAK floxed mouse models and chemical 
FAK inhibitors have allowed the delineation of several FAK-associated signaling pathways 
(Table 1). For example, several groups have used polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT)-
driven breast tumor models combined with tissue-specific FAK knockout through the mouse 
mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (MMTV-PyMT model)42–45 to assess FAK 
function in tumor progression.

FAK promotes invasive cell phenotypes

Tumor cell invasion into the surrounding microenvironment is a key step in cancer 
progression, allowing cancer cells to form metastases at secondary locations. This requires 
transition to a motile phenotype through changes in FA and cytoskeletal dynamics, and 
alterations in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression or activation to facilitate ECM 
invasion. EMT, which is driven by a transcriptional program, supports the progression to 
these invasive properties.

Canonical FAK signaling is linked to FA formation and turnover2, 19, 46. FAK recruitment 
and activation at nascent FAs involves binding to the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange

factor (GEF) ARHGEF28 (p190RhoGEF or Rgnef), and a FAK-ARHGEF28 signaling 
complex promotes local invasion of orthotopic colon carcinomas in mice47, 48. FAK-
ARHGEF28 dimerization and the associated increase in FAK activation is thereby linked to 
elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, an adaptor protein involved in FA 
maturation49. FAK also recruits the integrin activating adapter protein talin to nascent FAs, 
occurring independently of direct talin binding to β integrins50.

FAK not only promotes FA formation-maturation, but also drives FA turnover through 
control of targeted FA protein proteolysis. Mutations that disrupt FAK-talin binding inhibit 
proteolytic talin cleavage, preventing efficient FA turnover50. Protein cleavage is mediated 
by proteases like calpain-2 or caspase-8 containing multi-protein complexes51. Additionally, 
FAK proline-rich sites facilitate interaction with the actin-binding protein cortactin, whose 
phosphorylation by FAK contributes to FA turnover52. In head and neck cancer, blocking of 
an integrin/FAK/cortactin/JNK1 signaling cascade through specific antibodies against β1 
integrins renders cells sensitive to radiotherapy and delays xenograft growth53. Interestingly, 
FAK depletion decreases the abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at FAs, while 
simultaneously increasing their levels at invadopodia in a Src-dependent manner54. 
However, increased invadopodia formation is not sufficient to promote tumor cell invasion 
in the absence of FAK, indicating that increased FAK-mediated cell motility underlies an 
invasive cell phenotype.

Dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is another integral component of cell 
movement and cell protrusion. FAK-associated proteins such as talin and cortactin bind 
actin and link FAs to changes in actin dynamics19. Additionally, catalytically inactive FAK 
associates with Arp2/3 through its FERM domain and enhances f-actin polymerization in 
cooperation with N-WASP55, 56. These events are proposed to occur prior to integrin-
mediated FAK activation. In this model, the FAK FERM domain may function as scaffold 
to direct Arp2/3 activity to cell protrusions preceding mature FA formation.

MMP expression and activation at cell protrusions facilitates matrix invasion of motile cells. 
FAK activity increases MMP-9 expression and spontaneous breast carcinoma metastasis in a 
syngeneic and orthotopic mouse model57. Other studies show that MMP regulation and 
surface presentation in cancer cells involves multiple downstream pathways such as 
p130Cas58 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade59. Although mTOR effects on MMPs are not 
clearly understood, the FAK-p130Cas complex targets MMP-14 to FAs and promotes 
MMP-14 membrane surface presentation58. Knockdown of FAK or p130Cas does not alter 
the generation of pancreatic carcinoma protrusions, but prevents ECM degradation. During 
in vivo metastasis of human breast cancer cell xenografts in mice, MMP-14 function also has 
been proposed to require FAK signaling through an alternative pathway involving activation 
of Krüppel-like factor 860.

EMT-like transcriptional programs have been shown to drive tumor cell motility and 
invasion, and FAK signaling contributes to this EMT profile change61. FAK re-expression 
in FAK-null cells drives Snail1-induced EMT37. FAK scaffolding increases endophilin A2 
phosphorylation leading to alterations in EMT markers, including MMPs, and affecting 
PyMT-induced breast tumor progression38. Indirect factors such as micro-RNA-7-mediated

reduction of FAK expression results in loss of mesenchymal markers along with increased 
E-cadherin expression in breast tumor models18. Additionally, FAK may also act in a 
proximal manner to affect the dynamics of E-cadherin internalization in tumor cells39. Over-
expression of a FAK mutant unable to be phosphorylated on multiple sites in colon 
carcinoma cells blocks Src-induced E-cadherin internalization62 and pharmacological 
inhibition of FAK activity increases cell-cell adhesion strength in part by stabilizing E-
cadherin surface expression63. Together, these results implicate FAK in both the cell surface 
and transcriptional regulation of E-cadherin levels in tumor cells.

FAK drives tumor survival and growth

FAK promotes cell survival through kinase-dependent and -independent linkages. Kinase-
dependent pathways include signaling through the PI3K/Akt cascade (Figure 2)3. Integrins 
and other extracellular stimuli induce FAK-survival signals to prevent anoikis and other 
types of cell death3. In ovarian cancer, tumor ascites prevents death-inducing signals via 
activation of an integrin αvβ5/FAK/Akt signaling pathway64. Moreover, FAK activity was 
shown to promote anchorage-independent survival of murine ovarian carcinoma cells, 
independent of effects on Src kinase activity8.

FAK signaling is also associated with ovarian cancer resistance to paclitaxel-induced cell 
death65. Pharmacological FAK inhibition enhances chemosensitivity in taxane-resistant cells 
by decreasing YB-1 transcription factor phosphorylation in an Akt-dependent manner65. 
Additionally, phosphorylation of FAK Y861 by protein tyrosine kinase 6 has been 
postulated to initiate an Akt-dependent anti-anoikis cascade66. Simplistically, increased 
FAK activity-mediated survival signals in vitro correspond to increased tumor growth. 
However, it remains undetermined whether mutational activation of the PI3K or Akt 
signaling pathways, commonly occurring in tumors, may bypass effects of FAK inhibition. 
Additionally, FAK functions downstream of G-protein-linked receptors for stress hormones 
like norepinephrine, and prevents ovarian cancer cell anoikis7.

FAK activity also enhances cell cycle progression (Figure 2)46 and recent studies have 
linked this to a matrix stiffness-sensitive signaling linkage between FAK, p130Cas, Rac 
GTPase, and the actin binding protein lamellipodin67. However, studies with transgenic 
mice show that kinase-dead (KD) FAK-expressing fibroblasts and ECs grow normally68, 69. 
Thus, FAK kinase activity is not essential for proliferation of all cell types. Yet, tumor cells 
require FAK activity in the processes of extravasation and proliferation of micro-metastases 
in foreign tissue environments35, 70. Although conditional FAK knockout (KO) in the 
intestinal epithelium of transgenic mice shows that FAK is dispensable for normal intestinal 
homeostasis, these mice require FAK for intestinal regeneration following DNA damage71. 
Reduced cyclin D1 levels associated with decreased epithelial proliferation also occur in the 
colonic epithelium of FAK knockout mice during mucosal wound healing72. Additionally, 
double deletion of FAK and the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) 
suppresses tumor formation induced by APC loss71. Although it has been proposed that 
FAK inhibition (as opposed to FAK KO) may suppress colorectal cancer tumor formation, 
the mechanisms connecting FAK activity to cell proliferative responses remain unresolved.

A reduction in cyclin D1 levels upon FAK loss is associated with decreased ERK activity in 
mammary epithelial cells73. Similarly, FAK deletion in the mouse PyMT breast tumor 
model decreases Src-mediated p130Cas activation and signaling to ERK43. Ex vivo 
knockout and subsequent transient re-expression of FAK in cells isolated from PyMT-
induced breast tumors showed that FAK Y397 auto-phosphorylation, catalytic activity, and 
the integrity of FAK proline-rich region 2 (Figure 1B) are needed for cell proliferation as 
well as anoikis resistance45. In human breast carcinoma cell lines, FAK knockdown 
prevented tumor growth driven by oncogenic mutations in the Ras and PI3K signaling 
pathways45. These studies support the notion that FAK serves as a regulator for cell intrinsic 
signals promoting proliferation.

The location of FAK signaling complexes controlling cell survival and growth is also varied. 
Studies with FAK-KD mutants and pharmacological inhibitors support a kinase-independent 
scaffolding role in the nucleus38, 40, 68. In vitro, FAK nuclear translocation occurs after 
oxidative stress74 and upon pharmacological FAK inhibitor treatment75 (Figure 2). Nuclear 
FAK restricts p53 tumor-suppressive functions by promoting Mdm2 E3 ligase-dependent 
ubiquitination and degradation of p5311, 40. This prevents p53 transcriptional activity, 
reducing the levels of targets like the p21CIP1 cell cycle inhibitor76. FAK/p53 regulation 
may also release p53-induced inhibition of the PTK2 promoter, increasing FAK mRNA 
transcription. Interestingly, in a squamous cell carcinoma mouse model, FAK loss increases 
cell resistance to DNA damage after ionizing radiation, associated with p53-mediated 
induction of DNA repair77. Although this study raises the issue whether FAK inhibition in 
combination with radiation may be clinically disadvantageous, alternative conclusions find 
that endothelial FAK knockout acts to sensitize tumors to DNA-damaging therapy78.

FAK control of cancer stem cells

Cancer stem cells or tissue-specific progenitor cells can facilitate tumor growth, and in 
certain cancers, FAK signaling has been linked to the maintenance of these cell types. In the 
MMTV-PyMT mouse model, conditional embryonic FAK deletion suppresses mammary 
cancer stem cell (MaCSC) generation44. FAK loss reduces number and size of 
mammospheres and MaCSC surface markers. In the PyMT breast tumor model, FAK effects 
on MaCSC-associated markers are linked to FAK scaffolding effects on endophilin A238. 
Subsequent studies showed that FAK regulates MaCSC and normal progenitor cell activities 
via both kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms41. In a conditional FAK-KD 
knockin mouse, loss of FAK kinase activity impairs luminal progenitor proliferation and 
reduces the MaCSC number, but does not affect FAK scaffolding functions required for 
basal mammary stem cell self-renewal41. This suggests that pharmacological FAK inhibition 
may be effective in only the subset of human breast cancer subtypes arising from luminal 
progenitor cells. However, this needs to be tested further as orthotopic tumor growth and 
spontaneous metastasis of basal-like murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 breast 
carcinoma grafts is prevented by FAK inhibition in mice79. Inhibiting FAK also induces 
apoptosis in precursor B cells with a deletion in the Ikaros transcription factor80. Ikaros loss 
prevents B cell differentiation and locks precursor cells in a state of high adhesion-
dependent proliferation, a process associated with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia80. 
Precursor B cells rely on integrin/FAK signaling as major driver of cell proliferation,

survival, and self-renewal. Thus, FAK may be a key signaling protein downstream of 
integrins in the control of stem cell proliferation.

FAK in the stromal microenvironment

Signals between tumors and cells in the surrounding microenvironment can drive tumor 
progression. At sites of micro-metastases, tumor cells need to adapt to a new 
microenvironment and/or modify it. As mentioned above, non-cellular microenvironment 
cues, such as matrix composition or stiffness, cytokines, growth factors, integrins and pH 
changes trigger FAK activity that influences various aspects of tumor growth and metastasis. 
In this section, we will focus on the cellular microenvironment component, as FAK 
signaling plays important roles within vascular and non-vascular stromal cells in the tumor 
microenvironment.

Endothelial FAK in the control of progression

Several transgenic mouse models support the importance of FAK expression and activity in 
ECs during vascular development and tumor angiogenesis (Table 1). EC proliferation and 
survival are fundamental events promoting angiogenesis. Global, as well as EC-specific 
FAK-KO81–83, FAK-KD68, 76, or deletion of residues surrounding FAK Y39784 result in 
early embryonic lethality associated with multiple vascular defects, such as hemorrhage and 
edema. In vitro, primary ECs from these mice exhibit defects in survival, proliferation, 
sprouting, migration, and tubulogenesis.

EC FAK is considered a therapeutic target in vascular disease85, 86. In tumor-associated 
ECs, FAK mRNA and protein are elevated87 and FAK Y397 phosphorylation is increased88. 
Stimulated changes in EC migration are a fundamental component of angiogenesis and FAK 
activation downstream of growth factor, integrin, and cytokine receptors contributes to EC 
motility86. Pharmacological FAK inhibition prevents EC motility and tubulogenesis in vitro, 
aortic sprouting ex vivo, and growth factor-stimulated angiogenesis in mice24, 89. In a 
proteomic screen analyzing invading versus non-invading ECs in 3D-collagen matrices, pro-
angiogenic factors promote the association of RACK1 and vimentin with FAK during 
endothelial invasion90. This linkage is hypothesized to mediate changes in EC shape and FA 
formation, initial steps in tumor neovascularization.

Orthotopic glioma implantation in adult mice with EC-specific FAK deletion results in 
tumor vascular normalization associated with reduced vascular permeability (VP), partial 
restoration of EC-EC and astrocyte-EC interactions91. Similarly, EC FAK deletion in 
melanoma and lung carcinoma-bearing mice results in tumor growth inhibition by impairing 
VEGF-induced angiogenesis92. Surprisingly, increased melanoma and lung carcinoma 
growth occurs in FAK heterozygous compared to wildtype mice93. This FAK heterozygous 
phenotype was associated with increased angiogenesis, but it is unclear whether this 
represents compensatory mechanisms or reduced FAK activity. In contrast, pharmacological 
FAK inhibition prevents EC sprouting in a dose-dependent manner24 and FAK inhibitors are 
potent anti-angiogenic agents89. Furthermore, FAK inhibition reduces tumor angiogenesis in 
animal models of human colon94, ovarian8, 88, 95 and hepatocellular carcinoma96, supporting 
a stimulating role of FAK activity in angiogenesis.

During development, EC specific FAK-KO results in decreased EC proliferation and 
survival, and increased apoptosis81, 83. FAK-KO results in reduced VEGF-stimulated Akt 
phosphorylation, associated with reduced EC proliferation and increased cell death92. It 
remains unclear, whether FAK plays differential roles in maintaining basal EC proliferation 
and survival, as opposed to stimulated events occurring during angiogenesis. In adult mice 
with a developed vasculature, EC FAK-KO does not trigger apoptosis, in part because Pyk2 
is expressed and compensates for FAK loss in promoting cell survival23, 24 (Box 1). 
However, as mice with double FAK- and Pyk2-KO within ECs have not been described, it 
remains undetermined whether FAK-KD expression in a Pyk2-null background may 
function to promote EC survival and, if so, whether this would be dependent on a FAK-KD 
scaffolding or nuclear function. These experiments would provide important fundamental 
insights, as increased FAK nuclear translocation occurs upon treatment of ECs with FAK 
inhibitors75. Future studies need to determine the specific molecular roles of kinase-
inhibited FAK in potentially promoting EC survival, but preventing angiogenesis.

The vasculature of tumors is often disorganized, tortuous, and leaky86. These changes are 
associated with alterations in EC adherens junctions (AJs) that maintain vascular barrier 
function. During development, global or EC-specific FAK-KD expression results in 
disorganized EC patterning and defective blood vessel morphogenesis68, 76 (Table 1). In 
human ECs, knockdown of FAK enhances AJ stability, associated with enhanced cell 
membrane localization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)97. Although it was 
reported that conditional deletion of FAK in mouse endothelium disrupts lung barrier 
function in part through RhoA activity deregulation82, this phenotype has not been observed 
in two other EC FAK-KO mouse models24, 91. However, in other cell types, elevated RhoA 
activity occurs upon FAK-KO22, 98 and has been linked to alterations in Pyk2 and 
ARHGEF28 signaling22. Additionally, loss of FAK activity disrupted AJ formation during 
development76, but it remains unclear whether this is distinct from the observed embryonic 
lethal phenotype. In adult mice, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FAK activity does 
not alter basal vascular barrier formation, but instead prevents paracellular permeability 
increases by VEGF69. These results support both kinase-dependent and -independent 
connections of FAK to AJ regulation.

VEGF promotes VP via tension-independent FAK activation, rapid FAK localization to EC 
cell-cell junctions, binding of the FAK FERM domain to VE-cadherin, and direct FAK 
phosphorylation of β-catenin, facilitating VE-cadherin-β-catenin dissociation and EC AJ 
breakdown69. In glioma studies, FAK expression is essential for tumor-induced VP in the 
brain of mice91. The signaling pathway promoting FAK activation downstream of VEGFR 
is different from that triggered by integrins, as VEGF-stimulated FAK activation and 
binding to VE-cadherin is regulated by a conformational change within the FAK FERM 
domain69. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain 
undetermined. Subsequent studies revealed that FAK kinase activity is required for Src 
translocation to AJs, and that FAK controls VE-cadherin Y658 phosphorylation, required to 
promote VEGF-stimulated VP and tumor cell extravasation88. Notably, FAK-KD expression 
and VE-cadherin Y658F mutation in ECs prevents tumor cell transmigration across EC 
barriers. Importantly, EC-specific FAK-KD expression in mice decreases VEGF-enhanced

tumor cell extravasation in vivo, and EC FAK-KD expression prevents spontaneous 
orthotopic melanoma metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth88. While the 
mechanism for this anti-metastatic effect is not known, tumor- and VEGF-associated VE-
cadherin internalization within ECs depends on FAK activity. Mechanistically, these results 
are consistent with roles of EC FAK in modulating expression of VCAM-1, a protein 
mediating the adhesion of immune cells to ECs75, and E-selectin99. The latter is proposed as 
a mechanism to prepare vascular microenvironment sites for the seeding of metastatic 
disease (Figure 3).

Overall, these studies reveal new roles for EC-specific FAK activity in the control of 
metastasis. Further studies are needed to determine whether anti-tumor growth effects of 
FAK inhibitors are primarily mediated through signaling inhibition within tumor cells or 
through effects on EC function. FAK inhibition may possess beneficial effects for patients in 
the control of tumor and other vascular pathologies by preventing VP and angiogenesis 
without negative effects on EC survival.

FAK promotion of tumor growth via effects in non-vascular stromal cells

In addition to FAK signaling within tumor and ECs, non-vascular stromal FAK functions 
also contribute to multiple aspects of tumor progression (Figure 4). Neutrophils and 
macrophages are major effectors of immune responses in conditions that induce 
inflammation, including cancer. Myeloid-specific (lysozyme M Cre) FAK-KO in mice 
decreases the capability of neutrophils to kill pathogens and triggers accelerated spontaneous 
death100. Other studies question whether FAK is expressed in neutrophils, and have used a 
similar myeloid-specific FAK-KO model to study macrophage function101. Primary FAK-
KO mouse bone marrow macrophages have impaired directional chemotaxis in vitro and 
exhibit decreased monocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites in vivo. Pyk2 loss or 
combined FAK/Pyk2 knockdown have similar effects to FAK-KO, supporting overlapping 
signaling roles in macrophages101. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key 
contributors to tumor progression and cancer-related inflammation. In a mouse model of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, FAK inhibitor administration does not alter tumor 
angiogenesis, necrosis or apoptosis, but results in fewer TAMs within tumors and decreased 
primary tumor size102. In breast cancer mouse models, pharmacologic FAK inhibition 
decreases tumor growth, associated with diminished leukocyte and macrophage tumor 
infiltration79, 103. Other studies have used MX1-Cre to delete FAK in hematopoietic 
cells104, 105 and PF4-Cre to delete FAK in megakaryocyte lineages106. Resulting mouse and 
cell phenotypes are variable and have not yet been integrated into tumor studies (Table 1). 
Since potential “off-target” effects have been proposed to account for the inhibitory effects 
of FAK inhibitors on platelet spreading107, and most hematopoietic cells express Pyk2, 
combined Pyk2-FAK-KO or FAK-KD transgenic models are needed to further our 
understanding of tumor-immunological roles for FAK signaling.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence tumor progression through mechanisms that 
are not fully understood. In a breast carcinoma model, tumor-secreted lysyl-oxidase-like-2 
(LoxL2) activates fibroblasts and promotes α-smooth muscle actin expression in a FAK-
dependent manner via Akt activation108. This signaling was blocked in vitro by

pharmacologic inhibition of FAK but not of Src108. Since LoxL2 catalyzes matrix cross-
linking, the effects on FAK may also be mediated through increased tissue tension33. 
Accordingly, FAK expression and activity are elevated in fibroblasts from lung fibrosis 
patients. Interestingly, FAK inhibition in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model shows 
marked abrogation of lung fibrosis109. Although early studies suggested that FAK 
expression might inhibit fibroblast differentiation and α-SMA expression, the potential role 
of compensatory Pyk2 levels in FAK-null fibroblasts was not addressed110. Finally, similar 
to TAMs, FAK inhibition in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model decreased CAF 
recruitment and tumor size102. Together, these studies support the notion that FAK promotes 
pro-tumor CAF functions.

FAK also influences the tumor microenvironment indirectly. FAK signaling within breast 
carcinoma cells regulates VEGF expression that, as described above, promotes VP and 
angiogenesis111. In acute myeloid leukemia, FAK expression and activity are important in 
the production of interleukin-6, -8, SDF-1 and angiopoietin-1, factors crucial for 
mesenchymal stromal stem cell maintenance112. FAK inhibition decreases TNFα-induced 
breast cancer cell interleukin-6 production and is correlated with reduced tumor-associated 
splenomegaly and tumor-associated CD45+ cells in a syngeneic model79. Overall, there is 
emerging evidence for the importance of FAK signaling as regulator of EC, hematopoietic 
cell, platelet, macrophage, and fibroblast signaling in the tumor microenvironment. 
Importantly, phenotypes associated with FAK inhibition show that there are multiple points 
of regulation for FAK function not only in tumor cells but also in the tumor 
microenvironment.

FAK in clinical applications

FAK functions drive various tumor-promoting signaling pathways (Figure 2)3, 94, 113, 114 
and small molecule FAK inhibitors are emerging as promising chemotherapeutics, as FAK 
inhibition in mouse models prevents tumor growth, metastasis, vascular permeability, and 
angiogenesis8, 69, 79, 88, 89, 95, 102, 103, 115. Despite similarities between FAK- and Src-
associated signaling pathways116, 117, unique FAK substrates have been identified and 
combined treatment with FAK and Src inhibitors shows enhanced anti-tumor activity in 
non-small cell lung cancer models118. FAK inhibitors have also exhibited enhanced activity 
in combination with cytotoxic drugs65, 95 or agents targeting angiogenesis, like the receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib96. This supports the notion that FAK inhibition will yield 
distinct responses and may act as a chemotherapy sensitizer.

However, the ability of Pyk2 to take over certain FAK functions after FAK deletion (Box 1) 
has to be factored into the design of FAK inhibitor therapies and dual FAK/Pyk2 inhibitors 
may yield different phenotypes. Similarly, FAK’s kinase-independent functions (Figure 2) 
have to be taken into consideration when designing or testing FAK kinase inhibitor therapy 
approaches. FAK’s scaffolding functions are not blocked, but possibly enhanced by FAK 
inhibition40, leading to potentially unpredictable therapy outcomes. Compounds in 
development against FAK can be sub-divided into ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors (KI), 
molecules blocking FAK catalytic activity by alternative means (aKI), and compounds 
targeting FAK scaffolding (scaffold inhibitors, SI) (Table 2).

Small molecule ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors

Small molecules inhibitors that bind within the active site of kinases compete with relatively 
high levels of ATP present in cells. Inhibitors are designed to make binding interactions with 
residues surrounding the ATP binding pocket of kinases. The best characterized cellular-
active and selective nanomolar affinity FAK inhibitors are comprised of pyrimidine 
(TAE-226, PF 573,228, PF 562,271) or pyridine (VS-4718, previously known as 
PND-1186) ATP site hinge binders119–122. Despite highly conserved elements within the 
tyrosine kinase ATP binding pocket, FAK inhibitor selectivity is achieved through 
stabilization of the FAK kinase activation loop “DFG” motif into a helical 
conformation121, 123. The unusual kinase domain conformation and presence of Gly-563 
preceding the DFG motif may confer loop flexibility as well as FAK selectivity124. Other 
pre-clinical FAK inhibitors, as discussed later, do not possess this type of target selectivity 
and no peer-reviewed information is available for the clinical-stage FAK inhibitor 
GSK-2256098.

In cell culture and animal models, these FAK inhibitors effectively decrease FAK Y397 
auto-phosphorylation, prevent cell movement, but do not necessarily induce cell apoptosis in 
adherent culture conditions120, 122. Certain breast and ovarian tumor cells are resistant to 
growth inhibition at micromolar FAK inhibitor levels in 2D tissue culture conditions, but 
become sensitive to nanomolar FAK inhibitor concentrations when grown in a 3D 
anchorage-independent cell spheroid environment8, 122. This has been linked to cell type-
specific dependence on integrin-ECM signals within spheroids. Particularly in mesothelioma 
cells with inactivating mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes the Merlin tumor 
suppressor protein, survival and proliferation signals are mediated through cell-ECM rather 
than cadherin cell-cell contact signals125. Low Merlin protein levels are therefore predicted 
to serve as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in mesothelioma (Trial ID: 
NCT01870609) and possibly also in ovarian cancer126.

Alternative approaches to inhibit FAK function

New allosteric FAK inhibitors that bind to distinct kinase domain sites and do not directly 
compete with ATP binding are being developed127, 128. These compounds have the potential 
for high FAK specificity, but have not been rigorously tested in pre-clinical models. Several 
studies have identified small molecules via molecular docking analyses that may disrupt 
different FAK scaffolding protein-protein interactions. These include compounds of limited 
complexity (molecular weight < 300) termed C4, Y11, Y15, and R2 (Table 2). Proposed 
mechanisms are that C4 blocks FAK C-terminal domain interactions, Y11 and Y15 block 
access to the FAK Y397 site, and R2 blocks FAK interaction with p53129–131. These 
compounds act at micromolar concentrations in cells and show anti-tumor activity in 
xenograft mouse models. Although they have been shown to enhance the anti-tumor activity 
of other chemotherapeutics, questions remain about target selectivity.

FAK inhibitors in clinical trials

Pfizer (PF 562,271, Trial ID: NCT00666926) and GSK (GSK-2256098, Trial ID: 
NCT00996671) initiated phase I clinical trials with FAK inhibitors in 2008 and 2009, 
respectively. Both trials found that the compounds are tolerated with low adverse events.

Notably, in the Pfizer trial, some patients exhibited stable disease while being treated with 
FAK inhibitor132. However, PF 562,271 (now termed VS-6062) displayed non-linear 
pharmacokinetics and was discontinued. PF-04554878, a later generation ATP site hinge 
binder, showed more favorable pharmacokinetics, and a phase I trial identified some 
ovarian, colorectal, and bile duct tumor patients exhibiting stable disease (Trial ID: 
NCT00787033)

Following the acquisition of the FAK inhibitor rights, Verastem initiated new trials (phase I 
and II) with PF-04554878 (now named VS-6063 or defactinib) and one phase I clinical 
study with PND-1186 (acquired from Poniard, now termed VS-4718) (Table 2). A phase II 
trial in patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (Trial ID: NCT01951690) is 
testing responses to VS-6063 treatment based on the status of tumor-associated INK4a/Arf 
and p53 mutations. This study is based upon the finding that FAK inhibitor sensitivity may 
be associated with the inactivation of INK4a/Arf as part of a RhoA GTPase feedback 
pathway that leads to FAK activation133. Additionally, as VS-6063 was found to enhance 
taxane-sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells65, a phase I/Ib study (Trial ID: NCT01778803) 
is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of VS-6063 as combinatorial treatment with 
paclitaxel. Finally, the inverse relationship between Merlin expression and FAK inhibitor 
sensitivity125 provides rationale for trials with VS-6063 (Trial ID: NCT01870609) and 
GSK2256098 (Trial ID: NCT01938443) in mesothelioma, where a large number of patients 
possess mutations in the Merlin gene. Results from these trials will show if Merlin status can 
provide a useful biomarker to predict patient response to FAK inhibitor therapy.

FAK’s future as a therapeutic target

One of the strongest rationales for FAK inhibition is that effects are mediated through 
alterations in both tumor and stromal cell biology. Known pathways are the prevention of 
cell motility, invasion, survival, and proliferation that are being driven by oncogenes and a 
variety of cell surface receptors. In addition to cancer, FAK inhibition may yield clinical 
benefits for vascular pathologies such as edema and in limiting inflammation. FAK 
inhibition in the prevention of vascular permeability may prevent tumor metastasis, could 
enhance chemotherapy drug delivery, and may help overcome chemo-resistance in patients.

Interestingly, a recent report suggests that EC FAK inactivation may enhance the effects of 
DNA damaging cancer treatments like doxorubicin or radiation therapy78. In this study, EC 
FAK loss prevented doxorubicin-stimulated NF-kB activation and the production of various 
cytokines, which act to protect tumor cells from DNA damage-driven apoptosis. Further 
studies are needed to determine if this connection is generalizable or dependent upon the 
loss of FAK activity. Nevertheless, FAK inhibitors may be promising drugs for 
combinatorial therapies including DNA damaging agents, an approach that may increase 
efficacy of these agents and overcome chemoresistance.

Lastly, FAK inhibitors may possess single agent activity in cancers where FAK expression 
and activity are amplified or where tumor cells become dependent on FAK-associated 
signals126, 134, 135. Examples include Ewing sarcoma134 or ovarian serous carcinoma135, 
where treatment with the FAK inhibitor PF-562,271 blocked in vitro and in vivo tumor

Key Points

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that 
drives tumor growth and metastasis through kinase-dependent and –independent 
pathways.

FAK promotes metastasis by regulating processes involved in tumor cell 
motility and invasion, including control of focal adhesion and cytoskeletal 
dynamics, as well as the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) surface 
expression.

Tumor growth is enhanced through pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
functions of FAK.

FAK is connected to cancer stem cell and progenitor cell maintenance through 
kinase-dependent and -independent functions. FAK signals contribute to the 
malignant outgrowth of these cells.

FAK favors tumor progression via the regulation of signaling pathways within 
cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, hematopoietic 
cells, platelets, macrophages, and fibroblasts.

FAK activity promotes endothelial cell migration, proliferation, survival and 
stimulates tumor angiogenesis. FAK-mediated regulation of endothelial cell 
permeability can influence tumor metastasis.

FAK expression and activity in tumor and endothelial cells is frequently 
upregulated and correlated with a poor patient prognosis.

Several molecules targeting FAK kinase activity or its kinase-independent 
scaffolding function are under investigation in pre-clinical trials. Promising drug 
candidates in phase I or II clinical trials are small molecule ATP-competitive 
inhibitors.

Figure 1. FAK expression in cancer and FAK domain structure
(A) Percent of tumor samples with elevated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mRNA. The 
Cancer Genome Atlas was quiered using the cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org). Search 
criteria included mRNA expression data (Z-scores for all genes) and tumor datasets with 
mRNA data. Numbers of tumors analyzed (n) is shown on the X axis. (B) FAK consists of a 
central kinase domain flanked by a protein4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) homology 
domain on the N-terminal side and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain. 
Both terminal domains are separated from the kinase domain by a linker region containing 
proline-rich regions (PRR). Important tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation (P) sites are indicated; 
Y397, K454 and H58 play crucial roles in FAK activation. FAK binding partners are shown 
at their interaction sites within FAK. Binding of these proteins affects outcomes like cell 
motility (orange), cell survival (yellow) or both functions (orange/yellow). Roles involving 
FAK activation are shown in grey, important contributions to the tumor environment in 
green.

Figure 2. FAK connections to tumor growth and metastasis
FAK drives cancer growth and metastasis through kinase-dependent (green) or -independent 
(orange) functions. FAK is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), intracellular pH 
changes (H+), integrins, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and cytokine receptors. The 
exact mechanisms are not always clear (indicated by ‘?’). Oxidative stress and FAK 
catalytic inhibition increase FAK nuclear localization. (A) Active FAK increases cell 
motility through effects on Arp2/3, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEF), 
talin or cortactin, and Src- or PI3-kinase (PI3K) mediated signaling. This drives cytoskeletal 
remodeling, focal adhesion (FA) formation and turnover, and expression and cell-surface 
presentation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enhancing cell invasion and tumor 
metastasis. (B) Kinase-independent scaffolding of endophilin A2 induces the expression of 
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. FAK affects survival and proliferation 
through kinase-dependent and –independent roles to promote tumor growth. (C) FAK 
induces cell cycle progression through cyclin D1 involving Krüppel-like factor 8 (KLF8), 
Src–ERK, or JNK signaling. Signaling through PI3K/Akt mediates inhibition of apoptosis 
through transcriptional effects by NFkB or YB-1. (D) Nuclear FAK acts as a scaffold for 
p53 and Mdm2 in a kinase-independent manner, increasing p53 poly-ubiquitination (Ub) 
and degradation, thereby promoting cell survival.

Figure 3. Regulation of vascular permeability and extravasation processes by endothelial cell 
FAK
Tumor cells, via the secretion of growth factors and the activation EC-specific receptors (1) 
induce conformational FAK activation through multiple mechanisms. (2) FAK signaling 
promotes ERK/MAPK signaling cascade activation (3) leading to GATA-4-dependent 
transcriptional expression of VCAM-1 (4)75, a surface protein that can facilitate immune 
cell adhesion to ECs (5). EC FAK also promotes E-selectin expression (6) favoring tumor 
cell adhesion to ECs (7) and the lodging of metastatic cancer cells within sites of vascular 
hyper-permeability99. FAK activation can occur downstream of integrin receptor binding to 
matrix proteins consisting of a FAK-Src multi-protein complex (8). In response to VEGF 
signals, FAK promotes the localization of Src to adherens junctions; key sites that maintain 
vascular barrier integrity (9). FAK binding via FERM domain to the VE-cadherin (VEC) 
cytoplasmic tail, and FAK-dependent pY658 VEC and pY142 β-catenin phosphorylation 
(10) promotes VEC/β-catenin dissociation and VEC internalization/degradation. Loss of 
VEC from the cell surface leads to increased vascular permeability (11), allows for tumor 
cell transmigration across EC barriers, and leads to increased tumor cell metastasis 
(12)69, 88.

Figure 4. Tumor microenvironmental impact of FAK signals
FAK is an important regulator of EC, neutrophil, platelet, macrophage and fibroblast 
signaling in the tumor microenvironment leading to the increase (green boxes) or decrease 
(red boxes) of stromal cell functions. In ECs, FAK inhibits apoptosis and increases 
proliferation. EC FAK also contributes to the formation of abnormal vasculature via the 
increase of cell migration, survival, and vascular permeability (VP). Moreover, as described 
in detail in Figure 3, EC FAK is a key regulator of vascular permeability and tumor intra/
extravasation leading to metastasis. FAK stimulates macrophage and fibroblast migration. 
FAK promotes the differentiation (dotted arrow) of macrophages. This occurs in stimulus-
specific fashion where FAK activation either promotes or reverses (red/green box) fibroblast 
differentiation into CAF. For both macrophages and fibroblasts, FAK activity positively 
impacts cell recruitment to the tumor site. FAK promotes spreading, adhesion, and survival 
of stromal cells; with concomitant regulation ECM synthesis/remodeling to promote tumor 
progression. References are available in the corresponding text. VP: vascular permeability, 
TC: tumor cell, EC: endothelial cell, TAM: tumor-associated macrophage and CAF: cancer-
associated fibroblast.
