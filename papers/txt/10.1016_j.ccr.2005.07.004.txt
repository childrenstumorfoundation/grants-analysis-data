Summary

Malignant astrocytoma, the most prevalent primary brain tumor, is resistant to all known therapies and frequently harbors
mutations that inactivate p53 and activate Ras signaling. We have generated mouse strains that lack p53 and harbor a
conditional allele of the NF1 tumor suppressor that negatively regulates Ras signaling. The mice develop malignant astro-
cytomas with complete penetrance. The majority of tumors display characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme with con-
comitant alteration of signaling pathways previously described in the human counterparts of this neoplasm. We find that
the sequence of tumor suppressor inactivation influences tumorigenicity and that earliest evidence of tumor formation
localizes to regions of the brain that contain a multipotent stem cell population capable of in vivo differentiation into
neurons and glia.

Introduction

Astrocytomas, composed predominantly of astrocyte-like cells,
are the most common neoplasm in the central nervous system
(CNS) (Kleihues and Cavenee, 2000). According to the World
Health Organization (WHO) grading system, grade II–IV astro-
cytomas (collectively called malignant astrocytoma) are biolo-
gically malignant and diffusely infiltrate the brain. Grade IV
astrocytoma, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is one of the
most aggressive human cancers, with a median survival of less
than 1 year. Unfortunately, this prognosis has not changed sig-
nificantly over the past two decades, despite advances in neu-
rosurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (Holland, 2001; Maher
et al., 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002).

There are two subtypes of GBMs. Primary GBMs arise rap-
idly or de novo without any evidence of prior clinical disease,
whereas secondary GBMs derive from preexisting low-grade
lesions after long latency ranging from 5 to 10 years (Kleihues
and Cavenee, 2000; Maher et al., 2001). Human genetic studies
indicate that two frequent molecular characteristics of low-

grade astrocytomas are loss of p53 and elevated expression of
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK), PDGFR (Guha et al., 1995; Hermanson et al.,
1992; Nister et al., 1988). These observations suggest that
these pathways may participate in the initiation of astrocytoma.
Individuals afflicted with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are
predisposed to malignant astrocytoma in the brain with a
greater than 5-fold increased incidence throughout their lives
(Rasmussen et al., 2001). The NF1 tumor suppressor product
neurofibromin is a functional Ras GTPase-activating protein
(GAP) (Cichowski and Jacks, 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2001).
Thus, loss of neurofibromin results in abnormal activation of
Ras, a major mediator of RTK signaling.

Heterozygous mice carrying germline null mutations in both
p53 and NF1 on the same chromosome (termed cisNF1/p53
mice) develop low- to intermediate-grade astrocytomas, with
up to 75% penetrance depending on the genetic background
(Reilly et al., 2000, 2004). We reasoned that the increased inci-
dence of astrocytoma in NF1 patients might indicate a con-

S I G N I F I C A N C E

Recent studies indicate that brain tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, contain a subpopulation of cancer cells that display
stem cell characteristics, including self-renewal and multipotentiality, and are responsible for in vivo tumor growth. Whether these
brain cancer stem cells are derived from neoplastic transformation of normal neural stem cells remains to be determined. Through
analysis of mouse models with complete penetrance of malignant astrocytoma, we demonstrate that astrocytoma cells of all grades
display stem cell characteristics and that early presymptomatic lesions reside within the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral
ventricle, one region of the CNS that contains neurogenic stem cells. These studies provide evidence that the SVZ cells may serve
as a cell-of-origin for malignant astrocytoma.

vergence on the requirement for Ras signaling with sporadic
astrocytomas via PDGFR activation. To refine our understand-
ing of the target cell for p53 inactivation and Ras pathway acti-
vation in astrocytoma induction, we combined a germline p53
mutation (Jacks et al., 1994) with a neural-specific NF1 muta-
tion (Zhu et al., 2001). The resultant mice develop malignant
astrocytomas with 100% penetrance and provide evidence for
the cell-of-origin in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult
brain and a requirement for p53 loss preceding or concomitant
inactivation of NF1. The availability of an accurate mouse
model for malignant astrocytoma initiation and progression will
permit detailed investigation into the pathogenesis of, and
novel therapeutic targets for, this incurable tumor.

Results

Mouse models for malignant astrocytoma
In mice, genetic p53 inactivation fails to induce astrocytomas.
Instead, the predominant tumors are lymphomas or sarcomas
(Donehower et al., 1992; Jacks et al., 1994). We generated
three compound mutant mouse strains harboring mutations in
the linked p53 and NF1 tumor suppressor genes (Mut1–3; Fig-
ure 1). Critical for this purpose was the genetic configuration
of a floxed NF1 allele linked to a null p53 allele on mouse chro-
mosome 11 (Figure 1) and the use of a Cre transgenic strain
under the control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein pro-
moter (hGFAP-cre) (Malatesta et al., 2003; Zhu et al., submit-
ted; Zhuo et al., 2001). Although GFAP is widely used as a
mature glial-specific marker for normal and reactive astrocytes
in the CNS (Ridet et al., 1997), more recent data indicate that
the human GFAP promoter is also active in most embryonic
radial glial cells that exhibit neural progenitor cell properties
(Malatesta et al., 2000, 2003; Noctor et al., 2001; Zhuo et al.,
2001). To determine the scope of hGFAP-cre transgene expres-
sion and activity, we crossed this mouse strain to the Rosa26-
LacZ reporter strain (Soriano, 1999; Zhuo et al., 2001). Be-

tween embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E12.5, Cre-mediated
recombination, as revealed by LacZ expression, was evident in
discrete neuroectodermal regions of the forebrain and hind-
brain and in trigeminal ganglia (see Figures S1A–S1F in the
Supplemental Data available with this article online). Consis-
tent with previous reports (Malatesta et al., 2003; Zhuo et al.,
2001), the consequence of early ventricular Cre expression in
neural progenitor cells is that, at birth (P0.5), most cortical and
hippocampal neurons express the LacZ reporter gene (Figures
S1G–S1I). Thus, early onset of the human GFAP promoter in
neural progenitor cells leads to Cre-mediated recombination in
early CNS cells as well as their progeny, including adult neural
stem/progenitor cells in the SVZ (Merkle et al., 2004; Tramontin
et al., 2003) and neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes
(Malatesta et al., 2003; Zhuo et al., 2001).

Mut1 (p53−/−;NF1flox/flox;hGFAP-cre+) mice lack p53 in the
germline and NF1 function in CNS cells as a consequence of
hGFAP-cre-mediated recombination in developing neural pro-
genitor cells and mature astrocytes (Malatesta et al., 2003;
Zhuo et al., 2001). As in Mut1, Mut2 (p53+/−;NF1flox/flox;hGFAP-
cre+) mice lack NF1 in CNS cells but are heterozygous for p53.
Mut3 (cisp53+/−;NF1+/flox;hGFAP-cre+) mice are compound
heterozygotes for p53 and NF1 in CNS cells (Figure 1). All Mut1
(14/14; Figure 1) mice developed GFAP-positive astrocytomas
ranging from infiltrative low-grade lesions (grade II; Figures 2A,
2D, and 2G); to higher-grade anaplastic astrocytomas (grade
III; Figure 2B, 2E, and 2H); to GBMs (grade IV; Figures 2C, 2F,
and 2I). As a consequence of germline p53 nullizygosity, these
mice also developed lymphomas and sarcomas causing early
mortality, likely explaining the reduced development of GBM
(2/14) (Figures 2J and 2K). All Mut3 mice also developed CNS
tumors (58/58; Figures 1 and 2K), and among the subset al-
lowed to survive to end-stage of symptoms, approximately
70% had GBMs (14/21; Figure 2K) exhibiting every discernible
feature of the human counterpart, including the presence of
pseudopalisading tumor cells (Figures 3A and 3B), necrosis
(Figures 3C and 3D), microvascular proliferation (Figures 3E
and 3F), and secondary structures of Scherer (Figures 3G–3J).
All symptomatic Mut3 mice had anaplastic astrocytomas or
GBMs, while asymptomatic Mut3 mice had either low-grade
tumors or no tumors (Figure 2K and Figure S2). Given the
100% incidence of tumor formation, these findings are most
consistent with a model
in which tumors arise as low-grade
lesions that progress to higher-grade tumors with characteris-
tics of GBM over time.

In contrast

to the two genetic configurations described
above, the Mut2 strain rarely developed CNS tumors (Figures
1 and 2K; see below). Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that all Mut1 astrocytomas expressed Cre recombinase dem-
onstrating NF1 deficiency (Figure 4A), while at the molecular
level, astrocytomas from the Mut3 mice exhibited inactivation
of both p53 and NF1 genes (Figures 4B and 4C). These data
indicate that loss of p53 and NF1 is sufficient to initiate the
development of a full spectrum of malignant astrocytomas in
mice.

Molecular validation
Analysis of tumor tissues from human astrocytomas has dem-
onstrated accrual of specific genetic lesions during pro-
gression from low-grade to high-grade astrocytoma (Holland,
2001; Maher et al., 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002). These include

deregulation of the Rb-mediated pathway and the PI-3K/AKT/
PTEN pathway. We examined expression of two components
of the Rb pathway, Cdk4 and cyclin D1, by immunohistochem-
istry (Figures 5A–5F; n = 5) and found that these high-grade
tumors had intense nuclear expression of both Cdk4 (Figures
5A and 5D) and cyclin D1 proteins (Figures 5B and 5E),
whereas normal CNS cells did not (Figure S3). To examine the
status of the Ras pathway, activation of MAP kinase (MAPK)
was assessed with phospho-specific antibodies. Consistent
with loss of NF1 function, both low-grade (Figure 5G) and high-
grade astrocytomas (Figures 5H and 5I) contain high levels of
activated MAPK. In contrast, as in human tumors, activation of
AKT was consistently found in higher-grade tumors (grade II,
0/5, Figure 5J; grade III, 1/5, Figures 5K and 5L; grade IV, 5/5,
Figures 5M and 5P).

Two additional noteworthy molecular features of human
astrocytoma are present in these mice. VEGF expression in-
creases in the transition from lower-grade tumors to GBMs
(Figures 5N and 5Q). In addition, although morphologically sim-
ilar, high-grade tumors are molecularly heterogeneous, as evi-
denced by a regional downregulation of MAPK (Figure 5O)
within tumors that retain activated AKT throughout (Figure 5R).
These data are consistent with a causal role for loss of p53
and activation of Ras-MAPK in astrocytoma initiation followed
by deregulation of the Rb-mediated pathway and the PI-3K/
AKT/PTEN pathway in progression to GBM. These results pro-

vide experimental evidence that our tumor models resemble
human malignant astrocytoma both at the pathologic and mo-
lecular levels.

Site of tumor origin and stem cell characteristics
The cell-of-origin of astrocytoma is a much investigated but
unresolved question. While there has been increasing evidence
that human astrocytoma cells resemble neural stem/progenitor
cells (Hemmati et al., 2003; Ignatova et al., 2002; Singh et al.,
2003), the existing evidence also supports the model that has
evoked initial astrocyte dedifferentiation followed by malignant
transformation (Bachoo et al., 2002). Consistent with the can-
cer stem cell model (Hemmati et al., 2003; Ignatova et al.,
2002; Singh et al., 2003, 2004), astrocytomas of all grades
(Mut1, n = 14; Mut3, n = 21) expressed a marker for neural
stem cells, nestin (Figures 2G–2I; Figures S2E and S2F). In the
adult brain, two areas have been identified as primary sources
of multipotent neural stem cells (Gage, 2000). One is the SVZ
of the lateral ventricle, and the other is the subgranular layer
(SGL) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Alvarez-Buylla
et al., 2001; Gage, 2000). Histological analysis of end-stage
Mut1 and Mut3 brains showed that, as in human malignant
astrocytoma, high-grade astrocytomas were dispersed through-
out the brain (Figure S4A), and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) provided radiographic images characteristic of human
malignant astrocytoma (Figure S4B). To investigate whether tu-

Brain sections from the Mut3 brains were stained with H&E. GBMs from two
independent Mut3 brains were characterized by the presence of multifo-
cal pseudopalisading tumor cells (A and B), necrosis (C and D), microvas-
cular proliferation (arrows in E and F), and secondary structures of Scherer,
including accumulation of tumor cells in the subpial zone of the cerebral
cortex (G), perineuronal satellitosis characterized by tumor cells surround-
ing neurons (arrows in H), and perivascular satellitosis characterized by tu-
mor cells surrounding blood vessels (arrow in J). Arrows in I indicate mitotic

mor origin was dispersed or confined to specific regions, we
followed a cohort of seven asymptomatic 8-week-old Mut1
mice over a 3 week period (the last image was taken when
mice were 11 weeks old). Detectable tumor growth occurred in
five of these mice (Figure 6), always arising from the forebrain
in association with the SVZ (Figures 6A–6C). However, tumor
lesions that were barely detectable on the MRI scan (Figures
6D and 6E and Figures 6G and 6H) were of substantial size,
precluding unambiguous identification of the specific site of tu-
mor origin (Figures 6F and 6I), despite the fact that these tu-
mors were also associated with the SVZ (Figure 6I, inset). We
therefore next examined a cohort of 12 asymptomatic Mut1
mice at earlier time points between 6 and 10 weeks of age.
Seven of the mutant mice showed one or two early lesions per
brain. Among these seven mutant mice, five showed lesions

showed that the tail tissues of the Mut3 mice contained one wild-type NF1
allele and one floxed NF1 allele; Cre-expressing tissues (e.g., hindbrain)
retained the wild-type NF1 allele but lost most of the floxed allele as a result
of Cre-mediated recombination; and brain tumors lost both the wild-type
and the floxed NF1 alleles indicative of NF1 deficiency. Middle panel: a
PCR assay identifying the floxed NF1 allele and recombined floxed allele
(⌬) confirmed that the floxed NF1 allele in both hindbrain and brain tumors
transformed into the recombined allele. Of note, a subpopulation of cells
in tail tissues underwent recombination as well. Bottom panel: PCR assay

Adjacent sections from two grade III astrocyto-

(C and F). In contrast to normal CNS cells that

grade tumors showed strong nuclear staining of
Cdk4 and cyclin D1. Adjacent sections from a
low-grade astrocytoma (GII) (G and J) and two
grade III astrocytomas (GIII) (H and K; I and L)
were stained with anti-phospho-erk (P-ERK) and
anti-phospho-AKT (P-AKT), respectively. Arrows

directly associated with the SVZ (Figure 7), and the two others
had a lesion in the hippocampus and the thalamus, respec-
tively, but both contained abnormal cells within the SVZ (data
not shown). Normally, adult neural stem cells are tightly orga-
nized in the SVZ (Figures 7A, 7D, and 7G). In contrast, early
tumor cells were highly infiltrative. Early tumors showed infiltra-
tion into the white matter (Figures 7B, 7E, and 7H) and penetra-
tion into both the white matter and gray matter (Figures 7C, 7F,
and 7I). Similar to normal neural stem cells (Figures 7D and 7G,
arrows) (Doetsch et al., 1999), early tumor cells also expressed
both nestin and GFAP (Figures 7E and 7F) and proliferated (Fig-
ures 7H and 7I). These early tumor cells were morphologically

different from nestin/GFAP double-positive reactive astrocytes
(Figure 7F, inset) that were identified within the high-grade tu-
mors. The majority of Ki-67-positive cells expressed nestin
(Figures 7H and 7I; 95% ± 2%; n = 96). These observations
are most consistent with the interpretation that SVZ cells are
most susceptible to p53/NF1-mediated astrocytoma formation
and that incipient tumor cells share phenotypic characteristics
with normal neural stem cells.

The infiltrative characteristics of malignant astrocytoma typi-
cally place the tumor cells within a milieu of nontumor endoge-
nous neurons and glia. Among a total of 14 GBMs, we ana-
lyzed pure noninfiltrative tumor tissues in six GBMs. Two GBMs

A cohort of asymptomatic Mut1 mice was sub-

period. Representative T2-weighted images of
three Mut1 mice were scanned by MRI at week
1 (Wk1) (A and D), week 2 (G), and week 3

subjected to histological analysis. Sections at
similar levels of MRI images (B, E, and H) were

were identified on the images scanned at early
weeks (A, D, and G). Hyperintense T2 signals
ranging from strong to moderate to weak were
identified on the images at week 3 (B, E, and H).

contained tumor cells spreading on the surface of the brain
(Figure 8A). We also obtained two GBM tumor samples that
grew into the ventricular zone from the SVZ (Figure 8B). This
rare direction of growth resulted in pure noninfiltrative tumor
tissue. In addition, we analyzed two GBMs that formed multifo-
cal pseudopalisading tumor cells (Figure 8C). The identity of
these pure noninfiltrative tumor tissues was further confirmed
by presence of a series of classic neuropathological character-
istics including atypical nuclei. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that these high-grade tumors contained cells from all
neural lineages. Cells in the pure tumor tissues stained positive
for the following: an astrocytic marker, GFAP (Figures 8D, 8E,
and 8F); an oligodendrocytic marker, proteolipid protein (PLP),
that is the most abundant myelin protein in the mammalian
CNS (Figures 8G–8I) (Griffiths et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2000; Zhou
et al., 2000); and neuronal markers including Tuj1 (Figures 8M–
8O) and MAP2 (Figures 8P–8R). Of note, the expression of neu-
ronal markers Tuj1 (Katsetos et al., 2001) and MAP2 (Singh et
al., 2004) has previously been observed in human GBMs. Tu-
mor cells expressed minimal or no myelin basic protein (MBP)
(Figures 8J–8L), a marker for mature oligodendrocytes. The ab-
sence of MBP staining further confirmed that these tumor tis-
sues contained minimal or no endogenous neurons or glia, as
MBP is normally highly expressed in myelinating oligodendro-
cytes (Figure 8J, arrows). These data support the model that, in
vivo, glioblastoma cells have the stem cell capacity to undergo
multilineage differentiation (Singh et al., 2004).

Early p53 inactivation is critical for malignant
astrocytoma formation
Genetic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are com-
mon hallmarks of progression in many solid tumors (Vogelstein

et al., 2000; Vousden and Lu, 2002). In contrast, p53 mutations
are among the earliest genetic lesions identified in malignant
astrocytomas (Louis et al., 1993; Rasheed et al., 1994; van
Meyel et al., 1994; von Deimling et al., 1992). The availability
of the three Mut strains permitted us to examine whether the
early timing of p53 loss affected tumorigenicity (Figure 1).
Whereas the Mut1 strain harbors germline homozygous null
p53 (resulting in p53 loss preceding NF1 loss); the Mut2 strain
harbors a heterozygous germline p53 mutation such that, in
the context of hGFAP-cre, NF1 loss is forced by recombination
and precedes p53 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in neural pro-
genitors and derivatives. Finally, the Mut3 strain harbors a
cisNF1flox/p53 mutant chromosome and a wild-type chromo-
some in CNS cells. LOH in this strain occurs by loss of the
wild-type chromosome such that loss of both tumor suppres-
sors occurs simultaneously (a process referred to as co-LOH)
(Figure 1) (Cichowski et al., 1999; Reilly et al., 2000; Vogel et
al., 1999). In contrast to the Mut1 and Mut3 strains, the major-
ity of Mut2 mice analyzed (17/18) did not develop astrocyto-
mas (Figures 1 and 2K). About 20% of Mut2 mice survived to
the same age as tumorigenic Mut3 mice but did not develop
astrocytomas (Figure 2J). Approximately 80% of Mut2 mice
died at a significantly earlier age compared to Mut3 mice.
Since the incidence of non-CNS tumors observed in Mut2
(4/21, 19%) and Mut3 (11/58, 19%) was almost identical, we
cannot attribute the death of Mut2 mice to p53-associated tu-
mors. We speculate that premature death of Mut2 mice may
result from NF1 deficiency in developing CNS cells leading to
abnormal CNS development (Zhu et al., submitted). To rule out
the possibility that the premature death may preclude these
Mut2 mice from developing astrocytomas, we studied three

asymptomatic Mut3 mice at 18 weeks of age, a time point
when over 85% of Mut2 mice were alive and tumor free (Figure
2J, arrowhead). Histological analysis revealed that two of three
asymptomatic Mut3 mice already exhibited low-grade astrocy-
tomas (Figure 2K and Figure S2). We therefore conclude that
the target cells that give rise to malignant astrocytoma require
p53 loss prior to or concomitant to NF1 loss (Ras activation).
In the converse configuration, early loss of NF1 fails to provide
selective advantage to the target cells for tumor initiation.
These genetic data demonstrate that the early loss of p53 is
essential for astrocytoma formation in these mouse models.

Discussion

Mouse models
Detailed molecular characterization of human astrocytoma has
provided considerable insight into the many oncogenes, tumor
suppressors, and signaling pathways that become altered in
the processes of tumor initiation and progression (Holland,
2001; Maher et al., 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002). The present
study demonstrates that loss of p53 and activation of the Ras
pathway via NF1 inactivation in CNS cells is sufficient to cause
malignant astrocytoma formation with 100% penetrance. Al-
though malignant astrocytomas of all grades were identified in
both Mut1 and Mut3 models, exclusively low-grade lesions
were found only in presymptomatic mice, except for two Mut1
mice with p53-associated lymphomas. As compared to well-
differentiated low-grade astrocytomas in humans, tumors of
similar grade in these models display greater degree of nuclear
atypia. Along with these observations, rapid development of
GBMs in both Mut1 (from 10 to 20 weeks) and Mut3 (from 20

to 45 weeks) mice suggests that these models may resemble
primary GBM in humans. Consistently, a recent population-
based study reported that p53 mutations were identified in
about 28% of human primary GBMs, a subset of which (7.5%)
also harbored amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) (Ohgaki et al., 2004).

The role of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene
in malignant astrocytoma
Although benign astrocytoma in the optic pathway (optic path-
way glioma) occurs in 15% to 20% of children with NF1, the
NF1-associated risk of developing malignant astrocytomas has
not been determined until recently. One study using U.S. death
certificates from 1983 to 1997 reported that brain tumors oc-
curred 5.5 times more frequently in NF1 patients than in the
general population (Rasmussen et al., 2001). Particularly, the
relative risk of brain tumors in NF1 patients older than 10 years
was estimated to reach as much as 100 times greater than
those without NF1. Many of the tumors from such patients
were high-grade malignant astrocytomas (Gutmann et al.,
2002). Furthermore, molecular analysis revealed that NF1-
associated malignant astrocytomas harbored genetic alter-
ations, including p53 mutations and p16INK4A/ARF deletions,
that are commonly observed in sporadic counterparts (Gut-
mann et al., 2003). Together, these observations not only pro-
vide evidence that p53 inactivation can cooperate with NF1
loss in the development of human malignant astrocytomas, but
also suggest
that NF1-associated and sporadic malignant
astrocytomas may share similar molecular mechanisms un-
derlying tumor progression. Thus, our models may provide a
useful tool to dissect the molecular basis of tumor progression

underlying both NF1-associated and sporadic malignant astro-
cytomas.

Although one of the first characterized NF1 mutations in so-
matic cells was identified in a sporadic grade III malignant
astrocytoma (Li et al., 1992), loss of NF1 mRNA or protein ex-
pression was not observed in sporadic astrocytomas in a sub-
sequent study using a large number of human primary tumors
and cell lines (Gutmann et al., 1996). Thus, it is generally be-
lieved that NF1 is not involved in sporadic malignant astrocyto-
mas, which instead frequently activate Ras pathways via de-
regulated PDGFR or EGFR (Holland, 2001; Kleihues and
Cavenee, 2000; Maher et al., 2001; Zhu and Parada, 2002).

Particularly, p53 mutations and overexpression of PDGFR are
often identified in the same tumors, suggesting a cooperative
effect between these two pathways in the development of hu-
man malignant astrocytoma (Hermanson et al., 1996). Further-
more, the cooperative effect between p53 inactivation and
PDGF overexpression has also been established in a mouse
model using murine retroviral gene transfer (Hesselager et al.,
2003). However, in a recent study using the replication-compe-
tent avian leukemia virus splice acceptor (RCAS)/tv-a system,
targeted overexpression of a PDGF ligand (PDGF-B) into nest-
in- and GFAP-expressing cells in neonatal mouse brains in-
duced oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas,

loss of p53 did not
tively (Dai et al., 2001). Furthermore,
enhance the formation of these PDGF-induced tumors. Pos-
sible explanations for the discrepancy between experimentally
induced tumors via p53/NF1 or PDGF alterations include po-
tentially different cell-of-origin for these tumors, and differ-
ences in genetic backgrounds. The present studies demon-
strate that the most likely location for the cell-of-origin for
malignant astrocytoma in p53/NF1 mutant mice is in the SVZ
of the adult brain (see below). The localization and origin of
PDGF-induced tumors arising in neonatal brain cells remains
unclear. The target cells in that model apparently have greater
potential to undergo oligodendrocytic differentiation (Sauva-
geot and Stiles, 2002).

The site of tumor origin
Recent studies indicate that brain tumors, including GBM, con-
tain a subpopulation of stem cell-like cells or cancer stem cells
that display stem cell characteristics, including self-renewal
and multipotentiality (Hemmati et al., 2003; Ignatova et al.,
2002; Singh et al., 2003, 2004), and are responsible for in vivo
tumor growth (Galli et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004). Whether
these brain cancer stem cells are derived from neoplastic
transformation of normal neural stem cells remains to be deter-
mined. As compared to previously published mouse models
for malignant astrocytoma (Ding et al., 2001; Hesselager et al.,
2003; Holland et al., 1998, 2000; Reilly et al., 2000; Xiao et al.,
2002), the complete penetrance of the tumor phenotype and
rapid tumor development in Mut1 model allowed histological
and noninvasive MRI analysis to investigate the site of tumor
origin. The results indicate that, as in human GBM, mature tu-
mors are dispersed throughout the CNS, and yet the earliest
identifiable area of a tumor is confined to the SVZ. In the ge-
netic setting of the Mut1 model, all GFAP-positive mature
astrocytes or committed glial progenitor cells throughout the
adult brain contain the same genetic mutations (inactivation of
both p53 and NF1 tumor suppressors), as do the adult neural
stem cells within the SVZ. Therefore, the observation that ma-
lignant astrocytomas specifically are located within the SVZ in-
dicates that (1) there exists a specific cell type(s) in the SVZ
that is more susceptible to p53/NF1-mediated astrocytoma
formation as compared to those in other regions of the brain,
or (2) the microenvironment in the SVZ provides a favorable
niche for the growth of early tumor cells, which either arise
within the SVZ or migrate there from the other regions of the
brain. Based upon current knowledge, one fundamental differ-
ence between the SVZ and the other regions of the adult brain
(except for the SGL of the hippocampal dentate gyrus) is the
existence of specific GFAP-positive “astrocyte”-like cells,
which possess the capacity of stem cells to undergo self-
renewal and multilineage differentiation (Alvarez-Buylla et al.,
2001; Gage, 2000; Temple and Alvarez-Buylla, 1999). It has
been shown that these GFAP-positive neural stem cells are
present in the SVZ of both human and rodent adult brains
(Doetsch et al., 1999; Sanai et al., 2004). In light of these obser-
vations, our results suggest that the GFAP-positive neural stem
cells in the SVZ of the adult brain are a likely candidate to be
the cell-of-origin for malignant astrocytomas in our models.

A recent study demonstrated that neonatal astrocytes may
serve as a cell-of-origin for malignant astrocytoma in response
to deregulated EGFR signaling and INK4a/ARF deficiency.
Thus, it is possible that different cell types in the CNS, includ-

A R T I C L E

ing neural stem/progenitor cells, glial progenitor cells (e.g.,
NG2-positive glia), or even terminally differentiated astrocytes,
may serve as a cell-of-origin for malignant astrocytoma. The
combination of different glioma-associated genetic lesions may
induce different CNS cell types to form malignant astrocytoma.
Therefore, our models may mimic a subset of human malignant
astrocytomas with p53 deficiency and activated Ras signaling,
which may arise from the SVZ cells.

The timing of genetic mutations
We also provide genetic evidence that not only is inactivation
of both p53 and NF1 sufficient for initiation of astrocytoma for-
mation, but the timing of inactivation is critical. For astrocy-
toma induction, p53 inactivation must either precede or coin-
cide with Ras activation via NF1 loss. This is consistent with
the observation that mutations in the p53 gene are among the
earliest genetic lesions identified in human malignant astrocy-
toma (Holland, 2001; Maher et al., 2001; Zhu and Parada,
2002). In many other solid tumors, including colon cancer and
malignant peripheral sheath tumors (Kinzler and Vogelstein,
1996; Zhu and Parada, 2002), p53 inactivation occurs in later
stages of tumor development when tumor cells already display
invasive phenotypes. Thus, either early p53 inactivation pro-
vides a selective advantage for astrocytoma cells to acquire
early onset invasive phenotype or activation of Ras signaling
via NF1 loss leads to apoptosis or senescence of target cells,
which can be attenuated by p53 inactivation.

Although activated Ras mutations have not been identified
in human malignant astrocytoma, in mice, overexpression of
an activated H-Ras transgene under the control of the hGFAP
promoter leads to the development of malignant astrocytomas
with high penetrance (Ding et al., 2001). This is in striking con-
trast to the observations that loss of NF1 alone (e.g., Mut2
mice in this study) is not sufficient to cause astrocytoma forma-
tion in the brain (Bajenaru et al., 2002). Apparently, oncogenic
Ras signaling is not equivalent to NF1 inactivation. Given that
human malignant astrocytoma typically arises during adult-
hood, it is unlikely that human patients contain a significant
number of developing CNS cells with high levels of Ras signal-
ing as the Ras transgenic model does. In contrast, mutant cells
with p53/NF1 deficiency via co-LOH in the Mut3 model most
likely arise during adulthood, as these mutant mice had normal
development and did not develop tumors until 5 months of
age. In this regard, the Mut3 mutant mice may provide a better
model that mimics human malignant astrocytoma as an adult
disease compared to the Ras transgenic mice.

Clinical implication
Our study cannot rule out alternative models for astrocytoma
initiation such as cellular dedifferentiation and transformation
(Bachoo et al., 2002; Galli et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004). The
expression of nestin and other lineage-specific markers in tu-
mor cells can simply reflect deregulated gene expression.
Whether these nestin-expressing cells within tumors represent
the cancer stem cells remains to be determined. Nevertheless,
identification of the SVZ as the site of tumor origin in our mod-
els may have implications on therapeutic strategies for pre-
venting and treating a subset of human malignant astrocyto-
mas (Recht et al., 2003). These observations challenge models
of gliomagenesis, which assume tumor development from at
large transformed glia or committed glial progenitors. As a con-

sequence, for a tumor that arises from the SVZ, current treat-
ment focusing merely on local lesions will not be sufficient to
eradicate tumor cells, as these cells may be eventually replen-
ished from the cell pool within the SVZ. This may offer one
explanation of why the current treatment for malignant astrocy-
toma ultimately fails.

Experimental procedures

Generation of Mut1–3 mutant mice
The mutant mice harboring the linked p53 null mutation and the floxed NF1
allele on the same chromosome (cis mice) were generated by crossing
NF1flox/+ mice to p53+/− mice to generate p53+/−;NF1flox/+ trans mice that
were then crossed to wild-type F1 129Svj/C57Bl6 mice (Jacks et al., 1994;
Zhu et al., 2001). As for NF1flox/+ mice and p53+/− mice, p53+/−;NF1+/flox cis
mice were maintained on 129Svj/C57Bl6 hybrid background. The Mut3
strain was generated by crossing p53+/−;NF1+/flox cis mice to hGFAP-cre
transgenic mice that were generated on the FVB background (Zhuo et al.,
2001). The resultant Mut3 strain was crossed five generations onto 129Svj/
C57Bl6 hybrid background. Mut1 and Mut2 strains were generated by
crossing the Mut3 mice to p53+/−;NF1flox/flox cis mice. Therefore, Mut1–3
mice analyzed in this study were maintained on approximately 99% 129Svj/
C57Bl6 (49.5%/49.5%) and 1% FVB hybrid background. Many Mut1–3
mice analyzed in this study were littermates. Mice with the floxed NF1 allele,
p53 null allele, and Cre transgene were genotyped as described previously
(Jacks et al., 1994; Zhu et al., 2001). All mice in this study were cared for
according to the guidelines that were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committees of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dal-
las and University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

Histology and tumor analysis
Mice were aged until signs of distress appeared. Then, mice were perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and brains were dissected, followed by
overnight postfixation in 4% PFA at 4°C. Brains were divided into three
pieces along the rostral to caudal axis, and each piece was processed for
either paraffin-embedded or cryostat sections. Serial sections were pre-
pared at 5 ␮m for paraffin sections or 14 ␮m for cryostat sections. Every
tenth slide was stained by H&E. Stained sections were examined under light
microscope by Y.Z. and D.K.B. independently. Tumor grading was deter-
mined by Y.Z. and D.K.B. based upon the WHO grading system for malig-
nant astrocytoma (Kleihues and Cavenee, 2000). Adjacent sections were
subjected to immunohistochemistry (see below). For PCR analysis, tumor
tissues were dissected in ice-cold PBS and digested with proteinase K as
described (Zhu et al., 2002).

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were sub-
jected to immunohistochemistry as described previously (Zhu et al., 1998,
2001). The visualization of primary antibodies was performed with either a
horseradish peroxidase system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector) or immunofluo-
rescence by using Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse and Cy2-conjugated
anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson lab) at 1:200 dilution. The
dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: GFAP
(rabbit, 1:2000, DAKO), nestin (mouse, 1:200, Chemicon), Cre (mouse,
1:1000, BABCO), P-ERK (rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling), P-AKT (rabbit,
1:100, Cell Signaling), Cdk4 (rabbit, 1:200, Santa Cruz), cyclin D1 (mouse,
1:200, Zymed), Ki-67 (rabbit, 1:1000, Novocastra), VEGF (mouse, 1:50, Up-
state Biotech), Olg2 (rabbit, 1:300, a gift of Dr. R. Lu), NeuN (mouse, 1:500,
Chemicon), Tuj1 (mouse, 1:200, Covance), NF200 (rabbit, 1:200, Sigma).
Sections were examined under either a light or a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus). The colocalization of two antigens was further confirmed by
confocal microscopy (Zeiss).

MRI analysis
Mutant mice were scanned when they exhibited signs of distress. In prepa-
ration for MRI, a mouse was given Avertin (0.4 ml, 20 mg/ml; i.p.) and main-
tained under general gaseous anesthesia (1 dm3/min air and 0.8% isoflur-
ane). A mouse tail vein was catheterized using a 27G butterfly (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) for contrast agent administration. MRI experi-

ments were performed using a 4.7 T horizontal magnet equipped with a
Varian Inova imaging system. The mouse was placed in a home-built eight-
element birdcage coil (w2 cm in diameter). Fast scout images in a sagittal
orientation indicated pertinent slices for high-resolution images. T1-
weighted (TR = 250 ms; TE = 15 ms) and T2-weighted (TR = 1500 ms; TE =
80 ms) spin echo multislice (SEMS) axial images were acquired, and con-
trast-enhanced T1-weighted images were acquired immediately after i.v.
bolus injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA (0.1 mmol/kg body weight; Omniscan).
MRI parameters included a field of view (FOV) of 3–4 cm, a matrix size of
128 × 128, a slice thickness of 1 mm, and two acquisitions. Following MRI,
the mouse was sacrificed, and a whole mouse brain was dissected and
was subjected to histological analysis, as described above. Follow-up study
examined asymptomatic mutant mice once a week over a 3 week period to
detect tumor development.
