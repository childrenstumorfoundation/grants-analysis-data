SUMMARY

Hippo signaling represents a tumor suppressor path-
way that regulates organ size and tumorigenesis
through phosphorylation and inhibition of the tran-
scription coactivator YAP. Here, we show that serum
deprivation dramatically induces YAP Ser127 phos-
phorylation and cytoplasmic retention, independent
of cell-cell contact. Through chemical isolation and
activity proÔ¨Åling, we identiÔ¨Åed serum-derived sphin-
gosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) as small molecule activators of YAP. S1P
induces YAP nuclear localization through S1P2 re-
ceptor, Rho GTPase activation, and F-actin polymer-
ization,
independent of the core Hippo pathway
kinases. Bioinformatics studies also showed that
S1P stimulation induces YAP target gene expression
in mouse liver and human embryonic stem cells.
These results revealed potent small molecule regula-
tors of YAP and suggest that S1P and LPA might
modulate cell proliferation and tumorigenesis
through YAP activation.

INTRODUCTION

Organ size regulation is a highly orchestrated process involving
multiple signaling networks that respond to physiological cues.
Initially discovered in Drosophila, Hippo signaling is an emerging
tumor suppressor pathway that plays key roles in normal physi-
ology and tumorigenesis through the regulation of cellular prolif-
eration and survival (Harvey et al., 2003; Jia et al., 2003; Panta-
lacci et al., 2003; Tapon et al., 2002; Udan et al., 2003; Wu
et al., 2003). The core components of Hippo signaling are well
conserved in Drosophila and vertebrate, including Ste20-like
kinases MST1/2 (Hippo/Hpo in Drosophila), adaptor protein
SAV1 (Salvador/sav in Drosophila), NDR family kinases Lats1/2
(Warts/Wts in Drosophila), and transcription coactivators YAP
and TAZ (Yorkie/Yki in Drosophila) (Harvey and Tapon, 2007).
The signal transduction involves a core kinase cascade, in which
SAV1 facilitates MST1/2 kinases to phosphorylate and activate

Lats1/2. Subsequently, Lats1/2 phosphorylate YAP and TAZ at
the consensus HXRXXS motifs, including Ser127 of YAP and
Ser89 of TAZ (Zhao et al., 2007). These phosphorylation events
are inhibitory to the transcription coactivator function of YAP
and TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are sequestered in the
cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 protein (Pan, 2010). Inactivation
of the upstream kinases leads to the accumulation of YAP and
TAZ in the nuclei and promotes their binding to other transcrip-
tion factors, including TEA domain transcription factors (TEAD)
to regulate target genes expression (Chan et al., 2009; Goulev
et al., 2008; Ota and Sasaki, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Zhang
et al., 2008, 2009; Zhao et al., 2008).

Previous work has shown that cell-cell contact can activate
mammalian Hippo signaling, leading to MST1/2 and Lats1/2
kinases-mediated inhibition of YAP and TAZ. Extracellular matrix
(ECM) stiffness can modulate YAP and TAZ through Rho GTPase
and cytoskeletal rearrangement, independent of the core Hippo
kinases (Dupont et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011b). Enhanced
F-actin polymerization induces organ overgrowth in Drosophila
through activation of Yorkie (Ferna¬¥ ndez et al., 2011; Sansores-
Garcia et al., 2011; Wada et al., 2011). Cellular tight junction
(TJ) protein angiomotin and adherences junction (AJ) protein
a-catenin can directly bind to YAP and modulate its localization
and Ser127 phosphorylation (Chan et al., 2011; Schlegelmilch
et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011a). In addition, Fat and Dachsous
have been identiÔ¨Åed as receptor and ligand regulating
Drosophila Hippo signaling (Bennett and Harvey, 2006; Cho
et al., 2006; Rogulja et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2006; Tyler and
Baker, 2007; Willecke et al., 2006, 2008). However, upstream
signals that affect YAP in mammals require further investigation.

RESULTS

Serum Deprivation Induces YAP Cytoplasmic Retention
To identify regulators of YAP, we utilized an imaging-based YAP
nuclear localization assay that recapitulated cell-cell contact-
mediated YAP regulation: culturing HEK293A cells (an adherent
subclone of HEK293 cells) at low density (50% conÔ¨Çuency)
showed predominant YAP nuclear localization, whereas cul-
turing cells at high density (100% conÔ¨Çuency) led to Hippo
pathway activation and predominant YAP cytoplasmic localiza-
tion (Zhao et al., 2007)
(Figusre S1 available online). The

Serum-Derived Lipids Activates YAP

Figure 1. Serum Factor Induces YAP Nuclear Localization
(A) Serum deprivation induces YAP cytoplasmic localization. Normal culture media (with 10% FBS) in low-density HEK293A cells was replenished with serum-free
media (SFM) or fresh media containing 10% FBS for 2 hr. Cells are Ô¨Åxed and immunostained for YAP (green) and nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue).
(B) Serum deprivation induces YAP Ser127 phosphorylation. Cells were treated with media containing 10% FBS, 2% FBS, 1% FBS, or serum-free medium for
12 hr (SFM O/N), or serum-free media for 2 hr (SFM 2 hr). The total YAP protein level inversely correlates with p-YAP (S127) level, consistent with the previous
reports that YAP phosphorylation primes its degradation.
(C) HEK293A cells cultured at high density (100% conÔ¨Çuency) in normal media (DMEM + 10% FBS) exhibit high YAP cytoplasmic localization. After replacing the
media with serum-free DMEM (SFM) for 2 hr, YAP remains predominantly in the cytoplasm. After replacing the media with fresh DMEM + 10% FBS for 2 hr, high
levels of nuclear YAP are observed, indicating that serum factors can override contact-dependent YAP regulation.
(D) Western blot analysis of p-YAP (Ser127) in HEK293A cells cultured at high density. Culture media were replaced with DMEM supplemented with different
concentrations of FBS (lanes 2 to 6). Additional FBS was added directly in cells without media change in lanes 7 and 8 (data are represented as mean ¬± SEM, n = 3).
See also Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4.

Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between YAP-positive area and
cell nuclei was used to quantify YAP nuclear localization (see the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). During assay optimi-
zation, we serendipitously observed that YAP cytoplasmic reten-
tion and Ser127 phosphorylation could be dramatically induced
by decreasing the concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in
culture medium. This effect was independent of cell-cell contact
and could be induced within 2 hr upon serum deprivation
(Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, adding
fresh serum to conÔ¨Çuent HEK293A cells could induce YAP
Ser127 dephosphorylation and nuclear localization, overriding
cell-cell contact-mediated YAP inhibition (Figures 1C and 1D).
We observed a similar effect in additional cell
lines (HaCaT,
NIH 3T3, OVCAR-8, and RT-4) although less dramatic as
HEK293A cells and with sera from multiple species (goat, rabbit,
horse, and human), suggesting that such an effect could be
a conserved signaling event (Figures S2C and S3). Therefore,
we hypothesized that some unknown factor(s) in serum might
be novel
ligand(s) regulating YAP. In addition, we found that
MST1/2 and Lats1/2 kinases are dispensable for YAP Ser127
phosphorylation induced by serum deprivation, as siRNA-medi-

ated silencing of these upstream regulators does not block the
effects (Figure S4). The total YAP levels inversely correlate with
p-YAP levels, consistent with the previous report that phosphor-
ylation of YAP promotes its degradation (Zhao et al., 2010).

Chemical Isolation, PuriÔ¨Åcation, and Activity-Guided
ProÔ¨Åling of Serum Factors
Serum is a complex mixture of growth factors, nutrients, lipids,
and metabolites. To identify the active serum factor(s), we
utilized an activity-guided isolation methodology employing
the imaging-based YAP translocation assay. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we re-
placed the cell culture media (10% FBS) of
low-density
HEK293A cells with serum-free media (SFM) that had been sup-
plemented with various serum-derived fractions. After 2 hr of
incubation, we examined the YAP subcellular localization status
to test whether any serum-derived sample could restore YAP
nuclear localization.

We initially observed that the serum-derived activity survived
heat inactivation (60
C, 30 min), treatment that usually inacti-
vates complement

Serum-Derived Lipids Activates YAP

partitioning of the resulting supernatant against hexanes, to
localize the majority of the activity to an enriched aqueous frac-
tion (Want et al., 2006) (Figure S5). Separation of the active serum
extract by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) (C18) and subsequent activity proÔ¨Åling led to the
identiÔ¨Åcation of two active regions within the 40% and 60%
CH3CN in H2O steps of the elution gradient (Figure S6). To reveal
the components of these fractions, we Ô¨Årst conducted protein
mass spectrometry on the two most active fractions (F029 and
F037) and an inactive fraction (F021) to determine if any proteins
were selectively present in the active fractions. Our analyses re-
vealed the presence of multiple proteins, including apolipopro-
tein (Apo) A1, A2, and E. Interestingly, the number of identiÔ¨Åable
spectra corresponding to ApoA2 was greatest in the active frac-
tions and lowest in the inactive fraction (Table S1).

Lipids Associated with Lipoproteins Are the Active
Components
We tested puriÔ¨Åed, lipid-stripped human and bovine ApoA2 and
found that the protein itself was inactive. We then tested puriÔ¨Åed
lipid-bound human HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which
contain apolipoproteins (Schonfeld et al., 1978), and found that
both induced YAP nuclear translocation (Figure S7A). Consis-
C, 30 min) of FBS, which
tently, we also observed that boiling (95
usually denatures serum protein factors, did not affect the
activity to induce YAP nuclear localization (Figure S5). In addi-
tion, charcoal/Dextran-treated, delipidated FBS lost the activity,
suggesting that serum lipids might be the active component(s)
(Figures S2A and 3B). Taken together, we hypothesized that
the overall serum activity was likely lipid based and the speciÔ¨Åc
activity observed in F029 and F037 might be derived from free
lipids that coeluted with ApoA2, or residual lipid-bound ApoA2,
resulted from incomplete delipidation during the puriÔ¨Åcation
process.



To conÔ¨Årm the lipid activity, we then extracted fraction F037
and human HDL with butanol and tested the resulting organic
and aqueous partitions. In each of the extractions, the YAP
nuclear translocation activity was present in the organic (lipid
containing) partition, whereas the aqueous partitions (protein)
were inactive (Figure S7). However, attempts to further purify
and proÔ¨Åle the lipids in these fractions were not successful
because of the limited amount of active fraction available.

Previous reports have also shown that S1P indeed induces the
expression of Cyr61 and CTGF, both direct target genes of YAP
(Chowdhury and Chaqour, 2004; Li et al., 2008; Young et al.,
2009), suggesting that S1P might activate YAP transcriptional
activity. S1P is a well-described signaling lipid bound to HDL,
known to modulate diverse cellular functions,
including cell
proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Argraves and Ar-
graves, 2007; Pyne and Pyne, 2010; Spiegel and Milstien,
2003). The serum concentration of S1P ranges from 200 nM
up to low micromolar, with 65% bound to lipoproteins (Murata
et al., 2000). In addition, it is also known that S1P can activate
Rho GTPase, a possible regulator of YAP as described recently
(Dupont et al., 2011). Taken together, we hypothesized that S1P
might be one of many serum factors present in the active frac-
tions that regulate YAP.

We then compared of the extracts to the synthetic D-erythro-
S1P by high-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrom-
etry (LC/MS) and conÔ¨Årmed that S1P was present in the active
samples (partition b) and absent in the inactive samples (Figures
2C and 2D). The fragmentation pattern of S1P from F37b also
matched with the synthetic standard (Figure S8).

S1P, Dihydro-S1P, and Lysophosphatidic Acid
Activates YAP
To conÔ¨Årm that S1P dose-dependently induces YAP nuclear
localization, we tested a puriÔ¨Åed and synthetic D-erythro form
of S1P, dihydro-S1P (dhS1P), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),
lipids that activate related receptors (Choi et al., 2010; Rosen
and Goetzl, 2005). As shown in Figure 3A and Figures S9 and
S10, all three compounds induced YAP nuclear localization
with S1P being the most potent ligand (S1P: EC50 = 17 nM;
dhS1P: EC50 = 146 nM; LPA: EC50 = 316 nM). Another related
lipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P)
is inactive (Figure S9).
Sphingosine-1-phosphate also potently induces YAP Ser127
dephosphorylation and activates YAP transcriptional activity as
assessed by qRT-PCR of YAP direct target gene expression
(CTGF and Cyr61) (Figures 3B and 3C). Taken together, these
data indicate that serum-derived S1P and related lipids (dhS1P
and LPA) are endogenous lipid compounds that induce YAP
dephosphorylation, nuclear localization, and activation. We
focused our further studies on S1P as it is the most potent
compound identiÔ¨Åed.

Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Is Located in the Active
Fractions
We attempted to crudely separate different lipids contained
within HDL, F029, and F037, utilizing a modiÔ¨Åed Bligh and Dyer
extraction system described previously that yielded three parti-
tions (Kimura et al., 2001): (1) fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phos-
pholipids; (2) charged lipids soluble in aqueous solution under
alkaline conditions (such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, S1P);
and (3) substances soluble in an aqueous solution (e.g.,
proteins). In each case, the majority of the activity present in
the parent sample was located in partition b (Figure 2A). Partition
b of the most active fraction (F037) displayed dose-responsive
activity with an approximate EC50 of 1.66 mg/ml (Figure 2B).
These results indicate that lipids soluble under alkaline condi-
tions, such as S1P and sphingolipids, might be the active
factor(s).

S1P Induces YAP Target Gene Expression
Previously, a panel of 70 genes were identiÔ¨Åed as YAP target
genes and have been successfully used as molecular signatures
to predict YAP activation status (Cordenonsi et al., 2011; Dupont
et al., 2011). To probe whether S1P stimulation can activate YAP
signature gene expression, we carried out a bioinformatics anal-
ysis of published microarray proÔ¨Åling data deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO). We found that the YAP signature
gene panel is signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.0001) activated in mouse liver
samples
isolated from S1P lyase (SPL)-deÔ¨Åcient mice
(GSE18745), which have marked accumulation of S1P in plasma
and liver (Bektas et al., 2010). The YAP target genes are also
signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.0002) induced in human embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) treated with S1P (GSE7896) (Avery et al., 2008), suggest-
ing that S1P indeed activates YAP transcriptional activity (Fig-
ure S11). YAP has been shown to regulate hepatocyte

proliferation and embryonic stem cell self-renewal (Lian et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2009). It would be interesting to further study
whether YAP contributes to the effects of S1P in these systems.

S1P Induces YAP Nuclear Localization through S1P2
Receptor
S1P signals through a family of GPCRs, including S1P1‚Äì5 (Rosen
and Goetzl, 2005). To probe which receptor(s) mediates YAP
regulation, we carried out qRT-PCR mRNA expression proÔ¨Åling
of the S1P receptors in HEK293A and HaCaT cells, two cell types
that respond to S1P stimulation. We found that S1P2 is the most
abundant receptor expressed in both cell lines (Figure S12). S1P2
antagonist JTE-013 has also been shown to block CTGF and
Cyr61 expression, whereas S1P1 antagonist VPC4416 does not
(Kim et al., 2011; Li et al., 2008). Similarly, siRNA-mediated
silencing of S1P2, but not S1P3, blocks S1P-mediated YAP target

gene expression, suggesting that S1P2 is the receptor respon-
sible for the effects (Figure S13). S1P2 is known to couple to
the G12/13-family of G proteins, leading to the activation of Rho
GTPases, stress Ô¨Åber formation, and cytoskeletal reorganization
(Rosen and Goetzl, 2005). We found that Rho GTPase inhibitor
(C3, 3 mg/ml) and ROCK inhibitor (Y-227632, 10 mM) can both
block YAP nuclear localization induced by S1P (Figure S14A),
suggesting that Rho GTPase-mediated pathway is required for
the regulation of YAP. Rho GTPase activation induces F-actin
polymerization and stress Ô¨Åber formation. Consistent with this
notion, we found that serum deprivation disrupted F-actin stress
Ô¨Åber
in cells, accompanied by YAP cytoplasmic retention
(Figures 4A and 4B). S1P (300 nM) restored YAP nuclear localiza-
tion and F-actin polymerization (Figure 4C). Furthermore, F-actin
inhibitor (latrunculin A, 100 nM) can block S1P and LPA-induced
YAP nuclear localization (Figures 4D and 4E), suggesting that

S1P and LPA regulate YAP through F-actin polymerization-
mediated process. Previously, extracellular matrix (ECM) and
mechanical force have also been shown to regulate YAP through
Rho GTPase (Dupont et al., 2011). F-actin has also been
shown to regulate Hippo-YAP signaling. For example, induction
of extra F-actin formation by loss of Capping proteins induces
Drosophila imaginal discs overgrowth through activation of
Yorkie (Ferna¬¥ ndez et al., 2011; Sansores-Garcia et al., 2011).
These reports and our results suggest that F-actin polymeriza-
tion is a conserved signaling node that integrates signaling
inputs, including mechanical forces, cytoskeletal reorganization,
and serum/plasma lipids signaling, to regulate YAP activity.

DISCUSSION

Hippo signaling is an emerging pathway involved in tissue
homeostasis and tumorigenesis through regulation of YAP, an
important factor regulating stem and progenitor cell fate, cell
proliferation, survival, and transformation. In the last decade,
genetic studies have revealed components and the signaling

mechanisms of Hippo pathway in multiple
species and suggested that deregulation
of Hippo pathway is involved in many
diseases. Therefore, chemical probes
might provide additional tools to study
this important signaling in development
and diseases and to further explore
the therapeutic applications of modu-
lating Hippo signaling. To date, several
synthetic chemical compounds have
been identiÔ¨Åed to modulate YAP translo-
cation or YAP-TEAD binding through
high-throughput screens; however, their
potency and speciÔ¨Åcity of modulating
YAP need further improvement (Bao et al., 2011; Liu-Chittenden
et al., 2012). In this report, we have identiÔ¨Åed S1P and related
serum lipids as chemical factors regulating YAP nuclear localiza-
tion and activation. To our knowledge, the results establish a new
signaling mechanism by which serum lipid factors activate YAP
through GPCRs and Rho GTPases. S1P and LPA are known to
induce proliferation, migration, and metastasis of certain cancer
cells, and their levels are elevated in patients with several types of
cancers (Pyne and Pyne, 2010; Xu et al., 1998). The S1P biosyn-
thetic enzyme, sphingosine kinase 1 is also known as an onco-
gene (Pchejetski et al., 2011; Pyne and Pyne, 2010). Our results
suggest that YAP could be a downstream factor mediating
such biological activity and that small molecule ligands, such
as S1P, LPA, or S1P/LPA receptor modulators, could be useful
chemical tools to dissect Hippo signaling.

molecules that regulate YAP are still elusive in mammals.
Here, we report the discovery of serum lipids as potent
activators of YAP, providing insights to the regulation of
Hippo signaling and chemical tools to perturb YAP activity.
We also demonstrated that chemical
isolation, activity-
guided proÔ¨Åling, and high-throughput screen are powerful
tools to identify biologically active endogenous ligands
that regulate cell signaling. Further studies on the S1P and
LPA-regulated YAP activation might reveal novel physiolog-
ical and pathological roles of these bioactive lipids.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Activity ProÔ¨Åling of Serum Fractions and Synthetic Lipids
For all experiments, cells were cultured and plated in Dulbecco‚Äôs modiÔ¨Åed
Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM) + 10% FBS in 384-well plates and allowed to attach
overnight. Plating density was either 5 3 104 cells/ml for low density (50%
conÔ¨Çuency) or 2 3 105 cells/ml for high density (100% conÔ¨Çuency). Attached
cells were washed Ô¨Åve times with serum-free DMEM (SFM) at volumes
equivalent to the initial plating volume. Serum, serum-derived fractions, or
puriÔ¨Åed lipids were then added back and incubated for 2 hr. Untreated serum
was diluted in DMEM; lyophilized fractions were dissolved in DMEM + 3%
DMSO; and lipid extracts were Ô¨Årst dissolved in methanol and dried under

N2 (g) to create a thin Ô¨Ålm, dissolved in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free (FAF) BSA,
and diluted into DMEM. All puriÔ¨Åed lipids were initially dissolved in solvents
in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions, dried to make thin Ô¨Ålms,
dissolved in 4 mg/ml FAF BSA, and diluted in DMEM.

ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescence Staining
Cells were Ô¨Åxed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, prior
to permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Blocking and primary antibody
(anti-YAP, mouse monoclonal antibody [M01] from Abgent, San Diego, CA,
USA) incubation was combined in one step by adding antibody prepared in
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich). After 2 hr incuba-
tion, cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-mouse IgG and Hoechst 33342 nucleus dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) for 1 hr, followed by image acquisition by high-throughput confocal
microscopy (Opera High Content Screening System, Waltham, MA, USA).
Nine images/well were captured using a 10 3 PlanApo/0.3 NA objective at
a resolution of 0.65 mm/pixels.

Additional methods are described in the Supplemental Experimental

Procedures.
