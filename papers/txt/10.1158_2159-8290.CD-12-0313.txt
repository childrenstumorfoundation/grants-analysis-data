   ABSTRACT  

BRAF  mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without 
additional genetic alterations, tumor development is restricted by oncogene-induced 
senescence (OIS). Here, we show that mutations in the  NF1  tumor suppressor gene cooperate with  BRAF  
mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model,  Nf1  muta-
tions suppress  Braf -induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma 
development.  Nf1  mutations function by deregulating both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and extracellular 
signal–regulated kinase pathways. As such,  Nf1/Braf –mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but 
are sensitive to combined inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase 
kinase and mTOR. Importantly,  NF1  is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent 
 BRAF  mutations,  NF1  ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and 
NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies 
provide mechanistic insight into how  NF1  cooperates with  BRAF  mutations in melanoma and show that 
 NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin inactivation may have an impact on responses to targeted therapies. 
  SIGNIFICANCE:  This study elucidates the mechanism by which  NF1  mutations cooperate with differ-
ent   BRAF   mutations  in  melanomagenesis  and  shows  that   NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin  loss   may  desensitize 
tumors to BRAF inhibitors.  Cancer Discov; 3(3); 338–49. ©2012 AACR.

 INTRODUCTION 

 Oncogene-induced  senescence  (OIS)  is  an  irreversible 
growth arrest that is triggered by a variety of oncogenic signals 
( 1 ). This form of senescence functions as a protective response 
to aberrant cell signaling and has been shown to restrict the 
progression of benign lesions such as melanocytic nevi, lung 
adenomas,  neuroﬁ bromas,  and  prostatic  intraepithelial  neo-
plasia ( 2 ). Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie 
OIS, including excessive DNA damage ( 3–5 ), heterochromatin 
formation  ( 6 ),  negative  feedback  pathways  ( 7,  8 ),  and  chem-
okine  signaling  ( 8–10 ).  Notably,  these  mechanisms  are  not 
mutually exclusive, and it is likely that they cooperate to estab-
lish a senescence response in different tissues. 

 OIS has been shown to be important for restricting melanoma 
development in response to activating  BRAF  mutations ( 11, 12 ). 
BRAF  is mutated in 50% to 70% of human melanomas (reviewed 
in  ref.   13 ).  The  most  frequent   BRAF   mutation  ( BRAF  V600E  )

results  in  a  constitutively  active  kinase.  Analysis  of  human 
lesions  and  mouse  models  has  shown  that   BRAF  V600E    muta-
tions drive the development of benign nevi ( 14–16 ). However, 
in  the  absence  of  additional  mutations  melanocytes  within 
these nevi ultimately become senescent and do not progress to 
malignancy ( 11, 12 ,  15 ). Notably, a subset of genetic alterations 
found  in  human  melanoma  prevents  BRAF-induced  senes-
cence, underscoring the importance of OIS as a mechanism of 
tumor suppression ( 15 ,  17 ). Nevertheless, we still do not have a 
complete mechanistic or genetic understanding of how OIS is 
bypassed in melanoma or more generally in cancer. 

 We  have  previously  shown  that  oncogenic  RAF  triggers  a 
potent  negative  feedback  signaling  network  that  suppresses 
RAS  and  that  this  feedback  loop  plays  an  important  role  in 
OIS  in vitro  ( 7 ). Speciﬁ cally, in response to constitutively acti-
vated RAF and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–
regulated  kinase  kinase  (MEK)  proteins,  RAS  becomes  sup-
pressed because of the upregulation of several direct negative 
RAS regulatory proteins and the concomitant inactivation of 
positive RAS regulators ( 7 ). Moreover, RAF-induced RAS sup-
pression  substantially  attenuates  phosphoinositide  3-kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT signaling, which contributes to OIS in this setting 
( 7 ).  These  observations  raise  the  intriguing  possibility  that 
mutational events that promote RAS activation might play an 
important  part  in  preventing  RAF-induced  senescence.  If  so, 
then mutations in such genes might be expected to cooperate 
with  BRAF  mutations in human cancer. 

 The   NF1   tumor  suppressor  gene  encodes  a  RAS  GTPase- 
activating protein (RAS GAP) neuroﬁ bromin, which negatively 
regulates RAS by catalyzing the hydrolysis of RAS-GTP to RAS-
GDP  ( 18 ).  Accordingly,  RAS  and  downstream  effector  path-
ways are aberrantly activated in  NF1 -deﬁ cient tumors ( 18–20 ). 
 NF1  is mutated in the familial cancer syndrome neuroﬁ broma-
tosis type I and has more recently been shown to be mutated or 
suppressed by proteasomal mechanisms in glioblastoma, lung 
cancer, and neuroblastoma ( 21–25 ); however, the full extent of 
 NF1  loss in sporadic tumorigenesis is unknown. Because of its

direct effects on RAS and known involvement in melanocyte 
biology, we investigated a potential role for  NF1  in melanom-
agenesis.  Our  studies  reveal  distinct  mechanisms  by  which 
 NF1   mutations  cooperate  with  different   BRAF   mutations  in 
melanomas. Moreover, we have found that  NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin 
loss affects the therapeutic response to BRAF inhibitors.   

 RESULTS  
  Nf1  Mutations Rescue the Inhibitory Effects 
of Constitutively Activated RAF 

 We previously showed that oncogenic  RAF  alleles potently 
suppress  RAS  and  subsequent  PI3K/AKT  signaling  and 
that  this  suppression  is  important  for  OIS  in  some  settings 
( Fig. 1A ; ref.  7 ). Because  NF1  encodes a direct negative regu-
lator  of  RAS,  we  reasoned  that  the  effects  of  this  feedback 
response might be counteracted by ablating  NF1  expression. 
Wild-type and  Nf1  −/−  mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts (MEF) were 
stably infected with a hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible, 
activated RAF construct ( 26 ). 4-OHT substantially suppressed 
RAS-GTP  levels  in  wild-type  cells,  consistent  with  previous 
ﬁ ndings ( Fig. 1B and C ; ref.  7 ). However, RAF activation had 
minimal  suppressive  effects  on  RAS  activity  in   Nf1  −/−   cells 
( Fig. 1B and C ). Similar effects were also observed in cells in 
which   Nf1   expression  was  acutely  ablated  by  short  hairpin 
RNA  (shRNA)  sequences  (Supplementary  Fig.  S1).  Shortly 

thereafter, AKT phosphorylation became substantially reduced 
in   Nf1   wild-type  cells  at  both  Ser473  and  Thr308  ( Fig.  1D 
and E ); however,  Nf1  deﬁ ciency signiﬁ cantly ameliorated this 
suppression ( Fig. 1D and E ). It should be noted that even in 
the  absence  of   Nf1 ,  RAF  partially  inhibited  AKT  phospho-
rylation,  consistent  with  the  known  involvement  of  several 
redundant  negative  feedback  signals  ( 7 ).  Notably,   Nf1   loss 
caused  a  baseline  activation  of  the  PI3K/AKT  pathway,  as 
previously observed ( Fig. 1D and E ; refs.  19, 20 ), and therefore 
minimized  the  net  suppressive  effects  on  AKT.  Most  impor-
tantly,  however,  RAF  activation  exerted  differential  effects 
on proliferation in wild-type and  Nf1 -mutant cells. Consistent 
with  previous  observations,  oncogenic  RAF  caused  a  potent 
and irreversible growth arrest in  Nf1  wild-type MEFs ( Fig. 1F ; 
refs.   27,  28 ).  However,  RAF  activation  did  not  suppress  the 
proliferation of  Nf1 -deﬁ cient cells ( Fig. 1G ), showing that RAS 
suppression is a critical mediator of this inhibitory response.    
 Compound Mutations in  Nf1  and  Braf  Promote 
Melanocyte Hyperproliferation  In Vivo  

 To investigate the potential cooperativity of  NF1  and  RAF  
mutations in a relevant tumorigenic setting, we generated a 
mouse model to evaluate the effects of  Nf1  loss in the pres-
ence of activating  Braf  mutations. As noted previously,  BRAF  
is mutated in 50% to 70% of human melanomas ( 13 ). On the 
basis of our  in vitro  ﬁ ndings and the fact that neuroﬁ bromin

NF1 in Melanomagenesis

plays a well-established role in melanocytes ( 29 ), we evaluated 
the potential cooperativity of  Braf  and  Nf1  mutations in the 
context of melanomagenesis. 

 Mice  carrying  a  conditional  inactivating  mutation  in   Nf1  
( Nf1 ﬂ ox/ﬂ ox   mice; ref.  30 ) were crossed to mice with a conditional 
activating mutation in  Braf  ( Braf   CA   /+  mice; ref.  31 ). These ani-
mals were then crossed to a transgenic mouse strain harboring a 
tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–estrogen receptor fusion 
transgene that is under the control of the melanocyte-speciﬁ c 
tyrosinase  promoter,  designated   Tyr::CreER T2    ( 32 ).  Activation 
of CreER by tamoxifen in  Tyr::CreER T2 ; Braf   CA   /+  ; Nf1 f lox/ﬂ ox   mice 
leads  to  melanocyte-speciﬁ c  conversion  of   Braf   CA    to   Braf   V600E   
and the conversion of the  Nf1 f lox   alleles to  Nf1  null alleles. Six 
genetic cohorts of animals were generated to evaluate the effects 
of  Braf  activation in the presence and absence of  Nf1 . 

 Mice were treated topically with tamoxifen 2 to 3 months after 
birth, as previously described ( 15 ). After 4 to 5 weeks, signiﬁ cant 
darkening of the tails, ears, eyelids, perianal regions, and paws was 
observed in the  Tyr::CreER T2 ; Braf   CA   /+  ; Nf1 f lox/f lox   mice, as compared 
with all other genotypes ( Fig. 2A and B ). Whereas  Tyr::CreER T2 ; 
Braf   CA   /+   animals  exhibited  subtle  hyperpigmentation,  the  skin 
hyperpigmentation  in  the   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf   CA   /+  ;  Nf1 f lox/f  lox    mice 
became 
 dramatically  more  pronounced  over  time  and 
was  concurrent  with  visible  thickening  of  the  respective 

tissues  ( Fig.  2A  and  B ).  The  histopathologic  features  of  these 
lesions  were  consistent  with  expansion  of  the  dermis,  the  skin 
layer  in  which  murine  melanocytes  reside,  and  massive  melanin 
deposition  ( Fig.  2C ).  An  increased  number  of  cells  expressing 
the melanocyte marker S100 were observed, conﬁ rming excessive 
melanocyte  hyperproliferation  in   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf    CA   /+  ;  Nf1 f lox/ﬂ ox   
mice, as compared with the  Braf    CA   /+  genotype ( Fig. 2C ). Impor-
tantly,  we  found  that  deep  dermal  lesions  derived  from  con-
trol   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf    CA   /+   mice  stained  positive  for  senescence 
associated–β-galactosidase  (SA-β-gal;   Fig.  2D ,  top),  as  has  been 
shown  in  human  nevi  ( 12 )  and  in  lesions  within  the   Braf   V600E  -
driven mouse model described by Dhomen and colleagues ( 15 ). 
However,  senescence  was  not  observed  in   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf   CA   /+  ; 
Nf1 f lox/f lox   mice ( Fig. 2D , bottom). These results are consistent with 
our cellular studies and indicate that mutations in  Nf1  prevent 
 Braf -induced senescence of melanocytes in mice, thereby rescuing 
the proliferative restriction and triggering excessive proliferation.  
 PI3K is a well-known effector of RAS ( 33 ). We and others 
have previously shown that  NF1  loss triggers activation of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through RAS ( 19, 20 ,  34 ). Moreo-
ver ,  Nf1  mutations minimized the suppressive effects of  Braf  
mutations on this pathway ( Fig. 1D and E ). Notably, we found 
that  the  PI3K  inhibitor  GDC-0941  prevented  melanocytic 
hyperplasia in  Tyr::CreER T2 ; Braf   CA   /+  ; Nf1 f lox/f lox   mice ( Fig. 2E ),

  Nf1  and  Braf  Mutations Cooperate 
to Promote Melanomas in Mice 

 If OIS does in fact restrict tumor development, then  Braf/
Nf1 –mutant  mice  would  be  expected  to  be  more  prone  to 
developing melanomas. It has been previously reported that 
a  subset  of   Braf   V600E    mice  develop  melanomas,  presumably 
owing  to  the  stochastic  acquisition  of  additional  genetic 
alterations ( 15 ). Consistent with this observation 22% (6 of 
27)  of  the   Braf   V600E    mice  in  our  cohort  developed  melano-
mas;  however,  57%  (16  of  28)  of  the   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf   CA   /+  ; 
Nf1 f lox/f lox    mice  developed  melanomas  ( P   =  0.008;   χ  2   test; 
 Fig.  3A–E ).  One   Braf/Nf1 -mutant  mouse  developed  2  mela-
nomas,  an  event  never  observed  in   Braf -mutant  animals; 
however,  melanomas  from  both  genotypes  grew  at  similar 
rates.  These  observations  support  the  hypothesis  that   Nf1  
loss  prevents   Braf- induced  senescence   in  vivo   and  therefore 
plays a role early in tumor development rather than in pro-
gression. However, effects on metastasis could not be evalu-
ated in this model, as animals from both genotypes needed 

to  be  euthanized  because  of  primary  tumor  size.  Although 
pigmented  melanocytes  were  occasionally  observed  on  the 
exterior, these melanomas were typically hypopigmented ( Fig. 
3B ).  All   Braf/Nf1   tumors  displayed  histologic  and  cytologic 
features typical of malignant melanomas. Tumors were highly 
cellular,  with  most  showing  a  fascicular  growth  pattern  ( Fig. 
3C ). The degree of pleomorphism was variable. The majority 
of  the  tumor  cells  were  amelanotic;  however,  many  tumors 
showed  occasional  clusters  of  pigmented  cells  and  pigment-
containing  macrophages  (melanophages;   Fig.  3C ,  right).  All 
tumors involved the dermis as well as subcutaneous soft tissue, 
and ulceration of the tumor surface was seen in the majority of 
cases. Tumors expressed both S100 ( Fig. 3D ) and microphthal-
mia-associated transcription factor  (MITF;  Fig. 3E ), 2 markers 
typically  used  to  diagnose  human  melanomas.  Melanomas 
from  both  genotypes  were  further  evaluated  by  immunoblot 
( Fig. 3F ). One tumor that developed in  Tyr::CreER T2 ; Braf   CA   /+  ; 
Nf1 f lox/f lox   mice did not efﬁ ciently excise  Nf1 . However, in gen-
eral, higher levels of phospho-AKT were typically observed in 
 Braf/Nf1 -mutant  versus   Braf -mutant  tumors  ( Fig.  3F  and  G ), 
consistent  with  the  observation  that   Nf1   mutations  enhance 
PI3K/AKT activation and contribute to tumorigenesis, in part 
via this pathway (refs.  19, 20 ,  34 ;  Fig. 2E ).

from tumor tissues that were harvested 2 hours post administration of the respective treatment from 3 tumors shown in C. pS6, ribosomal protein S6.  

  Nf1  Mutations Desensitize Melanomas 
to BRAF Inhibitors 

 The mutant BRAF selective inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib; 
Plexxikon/Roche) promotes the regression of human melano-
mas  that  harbor  activating   BRAF   mutations  and  has  been 
approved for treating human melanomas ( 35 ). To investigate 
the sensitivity of melanomas harboring compound mutations 
in  Braf  and  Nf1  to BRAF inhibitors and other targeted agents, 
we ﬁ rst isolated cells from  Braf  and  Braf/Nf1 -mutant tumors. 
As  expected,  cells  from  2  independently  derived   Braf -mutant 
melanomas  were  sensitive  to  the  PLX4032  analog,  PLX4720 
( Fig.  4A ).  However,  cells  from   Braf/Nf1 -mutant  tumors  were 
insensitive  to  this  agent  ( Fig.  4A ;  IC 50   >  10  μ mol/L).  Bio-
chemical studies conﬁ rmed that increasing concentrations of 
PLX4720 effectively suppressed phospho–extracellular signal–
regulated  kinase  (ERK)  levels  in   Braf -mutant  cells  ( Fig.  4B ). 
Notably,  however,  phospho-ERK  was  not  as  effectively  sup-
pressed in  Braf/Nf1 -mutant cells ( Fig. 4B ). 

  Next,  we  evaluated  sensitivity  to  these  agents   in  vivo . 
Whereas allografts from several independent  Braf/Nf1 -mutant 
melanomas  were  readily  established,  cells  from   Braf -mutant 
mouse  melanomas  never  successfully  grew  as  allografts.  As 
such, we focused on using  Braf/Nf1 -mutant allografts to deter-
mine  whether  we  could  identify  a  more  effective  therapy  for 
these  genetically  distinct  tumors.  Two  weeks  after  injection, 
when  tumors  were  growing  in  log  phase,  mice  were  ran-
domly divided into different treatment groups. Similar to our 
 in  vitro   analysis,   Braf/Nf1 -mutant  melanomas  were  relatively 

insensitive  to  PLX4720  ( Fig.  4C ,  red)  and  phospho-ERK 
was  not  efﬁ ciently  inhibited  in  tumors   in  vivo   ( Fig.  4D ). 
This  ﬁ nding  is  consistent  with  the  observation  that  induc-
tion  of  tumor  regression  by  PLX4032  requires  almost  com-
plete  suppression  of  ERK  signaling  ( 36 ).  In  contrast,  these 
tumors were more sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 
( Fig. 4C , blue), which effectively suppressed phospho-ERK  in 
vivo  ( Fig. 4D ). Together with our  in vitro  studies, this insen-
sitivity  suggests  that  neuroﬁ bromin  loss  may  enhance  ERK 
activity  via  a  BRAF-independent  mechanism,  which  will  be 
further discussed later. 

 Because  our   in  vivo   experiments  showed  that  melanocyte 
hyperproliferation  in   Tyr::CreER T2 ;  Braf   CA   /+  ;  Nf1 f lox/f lox    mice 
could be rescued by the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941, we evalu-
ated  the  effects  of  GDC-0941  on  tumor  growth  and  found 
that it had a slight growth-suppressive effect on these melano-
mas  ( Fig.  4C ,  green).  However,  given  that  mTOR  has  been 
shown  to  be  an  important  effector  in   NF1 -mutant  tumors, 
we also assessed the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ( 20 ,  34 ,  37 ). 
Rapamycin  had  a  more  pronounced  effect  than  GDC-0941, 
but more importantly it synergized with PD0325901 to pro-
mote tumor regression ( Fig. 4C , purple). In contrast, rapamy-
cin did not promote tumor regression when combined with 
PLX4720 ( Fig. 4C , violet). Taken together, these results sug-
gest that  Nf1  mutations can desensitize  Braf -mutant melano-
mas  to  PLX4720.  On  the  basis  of  the  biochemical  function 
of  neuroﬁ bromin  and  the  preclinical  data  presented  here, 
therapies  aimed  at  targeting  both  MEK  and  mTOR  may

  NF1  Is Suppressed and/or Mutated 
in Human Melanoma 

 Given these compelling mouse phenotypes, we next investi-
gated whether  NF1  is lost or mutated in human melanomas. 
Like  P53,  neuroﬁ bromin  can  be  inactivated  by  both  genetic 
and proteasomal mechanisms ( 23 ). We ﬁ rst evaluated neuroﬁ -
bromin expression in a panel of melanoma cell lines. Four of 
11  cell  lines  exhibited  little  or  no  neuroﬁ bromin  expression 
( Fig.  5A ).  Sequence  analysis  conﬁ rmed  that  3  of  these  cell 
lines  harbored  loss-of-function  mutations  in  the   NF1   gene 
(Supplementary  Table  S1).  It  should  be  noted  that  2  of  the 
 NF1   alterations  (p.K1290K  in  A375  cells  and  p.K2307K  in 
WM3670  cells)  abolish  splice  donor  sites  (c.3870G>A  and 
c.6921G>A, respectively), result in defective splicing, and dis-
rupt  the   NF1   transcript.  Sequence  analysis  of  the  cDNA  of 
 NF1   enabled  the  detection  of  these  aberrant  splicing  events; 
however,  both   NF1   mutations  may  have  been  categorized  as 
“non-deleterious”  silent  alterations  using  exome  sequencing 
approaches. We then mined publicly available databases and 
identiﬁ ed numerous additional  NF1  mutations in human cell 
lines (Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of primary melano-
mas  also  conﬁ rmed  the  presence  of  somatic   NF1   mutations 
(Supplementary Table S2). In many, but not in all, cases  BRAF  
mutations were also present. These ﬁ ndings suggest that  NF1  
mutations can cooperate with activating  BRAF  mutations, but 
they may also play a broader role in melanomagenesis. Inter-
estingly, however, although we expected to ﬁ nd coincidental 
mutations with  BRAF  V600E  , we also observed  NF1  mutations in 
cells that harbored inactivating  BRAF  mutations (Supplemen-
tary Table S1), a point that will be discussed later.  

 To complement the mouse modeling studies and conﬁ rm 
a functional role for  NF1  inactivation in human melanomas, 
we  reconstituted  neuroﬁ bromin  in  A375  cells,  which  har-
bor  compound   NF1   and   BRAF  V600E    mutations.  Full-length 
neuroﬁ bromin expression potently suppressed the growth of 
xenografts in mice ( P  = 3.246E-004; Mann–Whitney  U  test), 

consistent  with  the  notion  that   NF1   inactivation  plays  a 
causal  role  in  tumor  development  ( Fig.  5B ).  As  noted  ear-
lier,  the  NF1  tumor  suppressor  is  frequently  inactivated  by 
proteasomal  mechanisms  in  human  cancer  ( 23 ).  As  such, 
mutational  analysis  may  underestimate  the  frequency  of 
 NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin loss in tumors. Therefore, we conducted 
immunohistochemical analysis on human melanoma tumor 
arrays. No visible neuroﬁ bromin expression was observed in 
15% (6 of 39) of melanomas and 18% (6 of 34) of metastatic 
melanomas ( Fig. 5C  and Supplementary Table S3). It should 
be noted that only a complete absence of staining was scored 
as  negative  in  this  analysis.  Therefore,  excessive  but  incom-
plete  neuroﬁ bromin  destruction  was  not  considered,  but 
could still play a role in tumor development.   
  NF1  Loss and BRAF Inhibitors in Human Tumors 

 Preclinical  studies  in  mouse  tumors  suggested  that   Nf1  
loss can desensitize  Braf -mutant melanomas to BRAF inhibi-
tors. To evaluate this possibility in human tumors, we geneti-
cally ablated neuroﬁ bromin expression with lentiviral shRNA 
sequences  in  human  melanoma  cell  lines  and  found  that 
 NF1   suppression  decreased  the  sensitivity  of  WM3526  cells 
to PLX4720 by 11-fold ( Fig. 6A  and Supplementary Fig. S2). 
As noted previously, A375 cells harbor a loss-of-function  NF1  
mutation and express very low levels of neuroﬁ bromin. Because 
these  cells  remain  somewhat  sensitive  to  BRAF  inhibitors, 
we  further  reduced  neuroﬁ bromin  expression  with  shRNA 
sequences and found that  NF1  suppression also decreased the 
sensitivity of these cells to BRAF inhibitors ( Fig. 6B  and Sup-
plementary Fig. S2). It should be noted that although the acute 
ablation of  NF1  in established melanoma cell lines desensitized 
these  cells  to  PLX4720,  tumors  that  naturally  developed  in 
the  absence  of   Nf1   were  much  more  resistant  to  this  agent. 
We  hypothesize  that  this  difference  may  reﬂ ect  inherent  dif-
ferences in preexisting signaling networks and/or cooperating 
mutations  in  these  established  tumor  cells,  which  did  not 
evolve  in  the  absence  of   NF1 .  Nevertheless,  consistent  with 
observations in mouse tumors, PLX4720 was much less effec-
tive  at  suppressing  phospho-ERK  in  cells  in  which   NF1   was

ablated, indicating that  NF1  loss promotes BRAF-independent 
ERK signaling in these tumor cells as well ( Fig. 6C ).  

 Finally,  we  were  able  to  obtain  frozen  tissue  from  5  sets 
of  pre-  and  posttreatment  tumor  biopsy  specimens  from 
patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) or com-
bined BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib + trametinib). Nota-
bly,  2  of  5  tumors  expressed  very  little  or  no  neuroﬁ bromin 
before  treatment,  consistent  with  the  observation  that   NF1 /
neuroﬁ bromin is lost or suppressed in human melanomas at a 
relatively frequent rate ( Fig. 6D ). However, in 2 of the remain-
ing 3 tumors in which neuroﬁ bromin was robustly expressed 
before treatment, neuroﬁ bromin was no longer expressed in 
tumors  following  treatment  ( Fig.  6D ).  Taken  together  with 
preclinical  studies  in  the  mouse  model  and  genetic  studies 
in  human  melanoma  cell  lines,  these  observations  further 
support  the  hypothesis  that   NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin  suppres-
sion  may  play  an  important  role  in  mediating  resistance  to 
BRAF  inhibitors.  Notably,  in  glioblastoma,  neuroﬁ bromin 
seems  to  be  more  frequently  lost  by  proteasomal  mecha-
nisms ( 23 ). Therefore, future studies aimed at assessing  NF1 /
neuroﬁ bromin loss in response to therapies will likely require 
analysis of both protein expression and genetic alterations.   
  NF1  Mutations Cooperate with  BRAF  Mutations 
by Activating Both K- and HRAS 

 Our central hypothesis is that loss of  NF1  alleviates the sup-
pression  of  RAS  imposed  by  activated  BRAF.  To  identify  the 
RAS  isoforms  that  are  critically  regulated  by  neuroﬁ bromin 
in  melanomas,  we  conducted  both  gain-  and  loss-of-function 
studies.  In  melanoma  cells  that  retain  neuroﬁ bromin  expres-
sion,  RNA  interference  (RNAi)-mediated  suppression  of  neu-
roﬁ bromin resulted in the activation of H- and KRAS but not 

NRAS ( Fig. 7A ). Conversely, reconstituting melanoma cell lines 
with  an  active  neuroﬁ bromin  fragment  suppressed  H-  and 
KRAS activity but not NRAS activity ( Fig. 7B ). Finally, shRNA-
mediated suppression of either  H - or  KRAS  suppressed the abil-
ity of  NF1 -deﬁ cient melanoma cells harboring an active  BRAF  
mutation to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar, whereas 
 NRAS -speciﬁ c  shRNA  sequences  had  no  effect  ( Fig.  7C–E ). 
These  results  suggest  that  neuroﬁ bromin  loss/suppression 
activates H- and KRAS in melanomas and that both of these 
isoforms are critical for the tumorigenicity of these cancer cells.  
 As shown in Supplementary Table S1,  NF1  mutations were 
also detected in cells that harbored inactivating  BRAF  muta-
tions. Although the kinase activity of these BRAF proteins is 
compromised, they have been proposed to function as scaf-
folds that translocate CRAF to the membrane and promote 
CRAF  activation  downstream  of  KRAS  ( 38 ).  Notably,  the 
oncogenic effects of these mutants are signiﬁ cantly enhanced 
in the presence of  KRAS G12D   ( 38 ). Similarly, an  NF1  mutation 
might be expected to function as an alternative mechanism 
of  activating  KRAS,  and  also  potentiate  the  effects  of  these 
 BRAF  mutants. To evaluate the contribution of RAS isoforms 
in human melanomas, we examined WM3629 cells. Interest-
ingly,  in  addition  to  harboring  the  kinase-dead   BRAF  D594G   
mutation  and  an   NF1   deletion,  this  cell  line  also  possesses 
an activating  NRAS G12D   mutation ( 39, 40 ). The WM3670 line 
similarly harbors an inactivating  BRAF  mutation, as well as 
 NF1   and   NRAS G12D    mutations  ( 39,  40 ).  Consistent  with  the 
presence of these mutations and our previous observations, 
NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS are all activated in WM3629 cells. 
Moreover, shRNA-mediated ablation of all 3  RAS  isoforms— 
 H -,  K -, and  NRAS —suppressed the ability of WM3629 cells to 
proliferate and form colonies in soft agar ( Fig. 7F–H ). These

results  further  show  that  neuroﬁ bromin  critically  regulates

vating  BRAF  mutations to promote tumorigenesis.    

 DISCUSSION 

 This  study  establishes  several  distinct  roles  for   NF1   in 
melanomagenesis. First, our data suggest that in the presence 
of  activating   Braf   mutations,   Nf1   loss  prevents   Braf -induced 
senescence  of  melanocytes.  In  mice,  this  results  in  exces-
sive  melanocyte  hyperproliferation  and  ultimately  enhances 
melanoma development. Importantly,  NF1  mutations cooccur 
with  activating   BRAF   mutations  in  human  melanomas,  and 
neuroﬁ bromin reconstitution potently suppresses the growth 
of  human  melanoma  cells  as  xenografts,  further  supporting 
a  causal  role  for   NF1   loss  in  melanomagenesis.  However,  we 
have found that  NF1  mutations can also cooperate with inac-
tivating  BRAF  mutations in melanomas. Although these  BRAF  
mutations are less common, in this setting we found that  NF1  
mutations cooccur with  NRAS  mutations and that all 3 RAS 
isoforms are required for the tumorigenic properties of these 
cells. Thus,  NF1  mutations can contribute to melanoma devel-
opment in at least 2 genetic settings via distinct mechanisms. 

 We also found that in the context of activating  BRAF  alleles 
 NF1  mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, in part by pro-
moting  activation  of  the  PI3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway.  Nota-
bly,  the   PTEN   tumor  suppressor  is  commonly  mutated  or 
lost in human melanomas ( 41 ). Mouse modeling studies and 
human  tumor  analysis  suggest  that   BRAF   and   PTEN   muta-
tions  cooperate  in  melanomagenesis  ( 14 ).  More  recently, 
 PTEN  loss has been shown to prevent BRAF-induced senes-
cence in mice and in human melanocytes, further supporting 
the notion that coactivation of these pathways is important 
for  preventing  OIS  ( 17 ).  Our  data  show  that   NF1   loss  is 
another  important  mechanism  by  which  the  PI3K  pathway 
can  become  activated  in  melanomas.  It  should  be  noted, 
however,  that   NF1   and   PTEN   mutations  do  not  seem  to  be 
mutually exclusive in melanomas. Moreover, we have found 
that  NF1  loss also results in the activation of multiple RAS 
isoforms  and  potentiates  ERK  activation  independent  from 
activating   BRAF   mutations.  Taken  together,  these  observa-
tions suggest that  NF1  loss contributes to melanomagenesis 
by enhancing the activation of both PI3K and ERK signaling, 
which may be important in the context of selecting effective 
therapies (model presented in  Fig. 7I ). 

 Several  mechanisms  have  been  reported  to  mediate  the 
resistance  of   BRAF -mutant  melanomas  to  BRAF  inhibitors

NF1 in Melanomagenesis

RESEARCH ARTICLE

( 42–46 ).  Additional  mechanisms  are  likely  to  be  discovered, 
and currently one prevalent mechanism of resistance has not 
emerged.  We  have  shown  that   Nf1   mutations  confer  resist-
ance  to  PLX4720  in   Braf -mutant  mouse  melanomas;  how-
ever,  these  tumors  are  sensitive  to  combined  MEK/mTOR 
inhibitors.  Importantly,  RNAi-mediated   NF1   suppression 
also decreases the sensitivity of human melanoma cell lines 
to  BRAF  inhibitors,  and,  most  notably,   NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin 
is  lost  in  a  subset  of  relapsing  and  residual  tumors  from 
patients  exposed  to  BRAF  inhibitors.  The  observation  that 
 NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin  is  also  mutated  or  lost  in  some  naïve 
primary  tumors  is  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that   NF1  
inactivation  may  contribute  to  both   de  novo   and  acquired 
resistance. However, although  NF1  mutations can be detected 
in human melanomas, the true frequency of NF1 loss may be 
difﬁ cult to assess, because like PTEN and P53, the NF1 pro-
tein is frequently inactivated by proteasomal destruction ( 23 ). 
Immunohistochemical  analysis  of  tumor  microarrays  indi-
cates that neuroﬁ bromin expression is completely absent in 
15% to 18% of melanomas; however, a more quantitative eval-
uation of protein levels may be required to accurately evaluate 
its expression or suppression before and after drug treatment. 
To date, much of the resistance to BRAF inhibitors seems to 
be  driven  by  events  that  activate  ERK  through  mechanisms 
that circumvent or decrease dependency on BRAF. However, 
aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has also been 
implicated in resistance to BRAF inhibitors ( 46–48 ). In this 
respect, NF1 (loss) is uniquely poised, as it activates the ERK 
pathway through its effects on KRAS and HRAS and at the 
same time enhances PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.   

 METHODS  
  Cell Culture Techniques, Infections, and 
Proliferation Curves  

 Wild-type  and   Nf1   null  MEFs  were  generated  as  described  ( 49 ). 
Cells  were  stably  infected  with  a  pBabe  retroviral  vector  contain-
ing  the  4-OHT–inducible  estrogen  receptor  RAF-1  (ΔRAF:ER)  con-
struct  ( 28 ).  This  construct  is  an  estrogen  receptor–RAF-1  fusion 
molecule,  and  contains  the  ligand-binding  domain  of  the  estro-
gen  receptor  fused  to  the  activated  RAF  kinase  domain  of  RAF-1. 
Cells  were  split  to  an  equal  density  16  hours  before  harvesting  in 
Dulbecco modiﬁ ed Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 1% fetal calf 
serum  (FCS)  and  different  concentrations  of  4-OHT  (0,  5,  50,  or 
500  nmol/L).  For  proliferation  studies,  cells  were  seeded  at  a  den-
sity  of  25  ×  10 4   in  a  12-well  format  in  DMEM  containing  10% 
FCS and different concentrations of 4-OHT (0, 5, and 50 nmol/L). 
Cells  were  counted  the  day  after  plating  and  every  other  day  after, 
until  uninduced  cells  reached  conﬂ uency.  Media  containing  fresh 
4-OHT  were  changed  every  48  hours.  The  melanoma  cell  lines 
were  obtained  from  the  American  Type  Culture  Collection  and 
the  Garraway  laboratory  ( 46 ).  No  additional  authentication  was 
done  by  the  authors.  All  melanoma  cell  lines  were  grown  in  RPMI 
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin. 
For  dose–response  curves,  cells  were  seeded  in  triplicate  in  a  6-well 
format.  Cells  were  counted  the  day  after  plating,  when  PLX4720 
(Calbiochem) was added, as well as after 3 days, when dimethyl sul-
foxide (DMSO)–treated cells reached conﬂ uency. To allow compari-
son of the IC 50  between cell lines, growth inhibition was calculated 
at 5 population doublings for every cell line. Neuroﬁ bromin activity 
was  reconstituted  using  the  previously  described  NF1-GAP–related 
domain (GRD) construct ( 20 ) or an expression vector containing full-

length   NF1   cDNA.  Neuroﬁ bromin  expression  was  abolished  using 
shRNAs speciﬁ c to  NF1  ( 20 ).   

  Preparation of Protein Lysates and Western Blotting  

 RAS-GTP levels were detected using a RAS activation assay, follow-
ing the manufacturer’s instructions (EMD Millipore). Tumor lysates 
were homogenized and extracted with boiling 1% SDS buffer. Result-
ing  protein  lysates  were  quantiﬁ ed  and  run  according  to  validated 
immunoblot procedures with the following antibodies: phospho-AKT 
(Ser473,  #4060;  Cell  Signaling  Technology),  phospho-AKT  (Thr308, 
#9275;  Cell  Signaling  Technology),  AKT  (#9272;  Cell  Signaling 
Technology),  phospho-ERK  (Thr202/Thr204,  #4370;  Cell  Signaling 
Technology),  ERK  (#9102;  Cell  Signaling  Technology),  phospho-S6 
(Ser235/236, #2211; Cell Signaling Technology), S6 (#2317; Cell Sig-
naling  Technology),  NF1  (#A300-140A,  Bethyl  Laboratories),  p120 
(#G12920; Trans Labs), RAS (#05-516; Upstate), KRAS (#sc-30; Santa 
Cruz  Biotechnology),  HRAS  (#sc-520;  Santa  Cruz  Biotechnology), 
NRAS  (#sc-519;  Santa  Cruz  Biotechnology),  and  MITF  (#M3621; 
Dako). Immunoblots were quantiﬁ ed with ImageJ software.   

  Experimental Animals  

 Animal  procedures  were  approved  by  the  Center  for  Animal  and 
Comparative Medicine in Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) in 
accordance with the NIH Guild for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals  and  the  Animal  Welfare  Act.  A  breeding  scheme  was  set 
up  in  which  mice  carrying  a  conditional   Nf1   allele  ( Nf1  f lox/f lox   mice; 
ref.   30 )  were  crossed  to  mice  with  a  conditional  activating  muta-
tion  in   Braf   ( Braf     CA/+   mice;  ref.   31 )  and  a  transgenic  mouse  strain 
harboring a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–estrogen receptor 
fusion transgene that is under the control of the melanocyte-speciﬁ c 
tyrosinase  promoter,  designated   Tyr::CreER T 2    ( 32 ).  Genotyping  was 
conducted  by  PCR,  as  described  for  every  model  ( 30–32 ).  To  acti-
vate   Tyr::CreER  T2 ,  mice  were  treated  topically  with  freshly  prepared 
tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma) 2 to 3 months after birth. Tamoxifen (20 
mg/mL in 100% ethanol) was applied to a small section of skin on the 
shaven backs, and the treatment schedule consisted of 4 treatments 
over  7  days.  For  all  genotypes,  pigmentation  levels  were  quantiﬁ ed 
weekly on a scale from 0 (no pigmentation) to 8 (high pigmentation). 
To study the contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway to the observed 
hyperpigmentation phenotype in the  Tyr::CreER T2 ; Braf   CA   /+  ; Nf1 f lox/f lox   
mice, animals were treated daily with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 
(150 mg/kg, oral gavage) for 8 weeks after  Tyr::CreER T2   induction.   

  Xenograft Studies and Treatments  

 For  cancer  cell  xenograft  experiments,  nude  mice  were  inoculated 
subcutaneously with 3 × 10 6  human or mouse melanoma cells. Tumor 
volumes were calculated by measuring length and width of the lesions 
and  with  the  formula  [(length)  ×  (width) 2   ×  0.52].  Murine   Braf/Nf1 -
mutant  melanoma  cells  formed  rapidly  growing  tumors.  Two  weeks 
after injection, when tumors were growing in log phase, mice were ran-
domly divided into different treatment groups that were administered 
the  PI3K  inhibitor  GDC-0941  (150  mg/kg,  oral  gavage),  the  mTOR 
inhibitor  rapamycin  [5  mg/kg,  intraperitoneal  (i.p.)  injection],  the 
MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (10 mg/kg, oral gavage), the BRAF inhibi-
tor PLX4720 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), or the combination of both PD0325901 
or PLX4720 and rapamycin. Mice were treated daily for 7 days.   

  Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and SA-b-gal Staining  

 Tissues were ﬁ xed in formalin, embedded in parafﬁ n, and stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) when indicated. Standard immu-
nohistochemistry and immunoﬂ uorescence protocols were followed 
for  S100  (Z0311,  1:400;  Dako)  staining.  An  alkaline  phosphatase 
staining method was used for NF1 (ab30325, 1:300; Abcam) immu-
nohistochemistry.  Antigen  unmasking  was  conducted  by  pressure

cooking in citrate buffer (pH 6). A human melanoma tissue micro-
array  (ME804a;  US  Biomax  Inc.)  was  used  for  evaluation  of  NF1 
expression in malignant and metastatic melanomas. SA-β-gal stain-
ing was conducted on fresh mouse tissue. Small pieces were ﬁ xed for 
30 minutes in 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated in SA-β-gal staining 
solution as described ( 50 ), and then embedded and sectioned.   

  NF1 Mutational Analysis and Data Mining  

 The  entire   NF1   coding  region  of  11  human  melanoma  cell  lines 
( Fig.  5A )  was  ampliﬁ ed  in  5  overlapping  reverse-transcription  PCR 
(RT-PCR ) fragments and used as the template for direct sequencing, 
essentially  as  described  ( 51 ).  Copy  number  analysis  by  multiplex 
ligation-dependent  probe  ampliﬁ cation  (MLPA)  was  conducted  as 
described ( 52 ). The nomenclature of the mutations is based on  NF1  
mRNA sequence NM_001042492.2, with 1 being the ﬁ rst nucleotide 
of the ATG start codon. Next, publicly available resources providing 
information on somatic mutations implicated in human melanoma 
cell lines ( 53, 54 ) and primary tumors ( 55–57 ) were mined.   

  Patient Samples  

 Patients  with  metastatic  melanoma  containing  the   BRAF  V600E  
mutation (conﬁ rmed by genotyping) were enrolled in clinical trials 
for  treatment  with  a  BRAF  inhibitor  (vemurafenib)  or  combined 
BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib + trametinib), and their consent 
was  obtained  for  tissue  acquisition  per  Institutional  Review  Board 
(IRB)–approved  protocol.  Tumor  biopsies  were  conducted  pretreat-
ment (day 0), at 10 to 14 days on treatment, and/or at time of pro-
gression if applicable. Formalin-ﬁ xed tissue was analyzed to conﬁ rm 
that  viable  tumor  was  present  via  H&E  staining.  Additional  tissue 
was snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
