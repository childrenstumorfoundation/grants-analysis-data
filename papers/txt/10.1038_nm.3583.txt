Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. 
NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase–activating protein neurofibromin. We report here 
that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor 
of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression 
of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation 
also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2–induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline 
phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization 
and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-a enzyme therapy aimed 
at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also 
suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal 
conditions could be prevented pharmacologically.

Mutations in the NF1 gene cause NF1, a genetic disorder with an inci-
dence of 1/3,500 live births worldwide. This condition is character-
ized by malignant and nonmalignant pathologies, including skeletal 
manifestations1–6. Dystrophic scoliosis, tibia bowing, bone fragility, 
fracture and pseudarthrosis (nonunion following fracture) are skel-
etal conditions associated with high morbidity in this population7–10. 
Despite recent progress toward understanding the role of NF1 in skel-
etal tissues, it is still unclear why and how these bone pathologies 
arise, raising uncertainty regarding optimal treatment2,3.

Although individuals with NF1 are typically born with heterozygous 
mutations in NF1, loss of heterozygosity has been detected in pseudar-
throsis biopsies11, suggesting that local somatic NF1 loss of function 
contributes to NF1 skeletal dysplasia. This point is further supported by 
the relative commonality of defects observed between pseudarthrosis 
lesions from individuals with NF1 and the skeleton of mice character-
ized by conditional loss of Nf1 in osteoprogenitors. These mice indeed 
tend to recapitulate, in their entire skeleton, the genetic and cellular 
consequences of NF1 loss of function that occurs locally in human 
NF1 pseudarthroses. Nf1 inactivation in osteochondroprogenitors  

in Nf1flox/flox; Prx-cre or Nf1flox/flox; Col2a1-cre mice (herein called 
Prx-Nf1 KO or Col2-Nf1 KO mice, respectively) led to reduced stat-
ure, low bone mass, tibia bowing, diaphyseal ectopic blood vessel 
formation and hypomineralization associated with weakened bone 
mechanical  properties.  Bone  cellular  parameters  also  indicated 
that  neurofibromin  is  required  for  normal  osteoblast  differentia-
tion and expression of Tnfsf11, the gene encoding receptor activator 
of nuclear factor κB ligand, and hence for osteoclastogenesis12–18. 
The existence of Nf1-deficient osteoblasts in an Nf1 heterozygous 
bone  microenvironment  has  also  been  shown  to  cause  bone  loss 
and delayed bone healing in Nf1flox/flox; Col1a1-cre (Col1-Nf1 KO)  
mice  via  activation  of  transforming  growth  factor-β  (TGF-β)  
signaling19. Notably, each of these NF1 models, as well as bone biop-
sies from individuals with NF1 pseudarthrosis20, are characterized  
by  excessive  deposition  of  unmineralized  bone  matrix  (osteoid) 
despite normal serum phosphate and calcium concentrations.

Bone  matrix  mineralization  is  a  tightly  regulated  process  that 
requires collagen, calcium and phosphate to form ordered crystals 
of hydroxyapatite, as well as tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase

and generate inorganic phosphate21. Extracellular concentrations of 
PPi are determined by (i) its degradation via ALP, (ii) its synthesis 
catalyzed  by  the  nucleoside  triphosphate  pyrophosphohydrolase 
ENPP1/PC-1 (called ENPP1 herein) and (iii) its transport into the 
extracellular milieu through the PPi channel ANK22. Mineralization is 
also controlled by Phospho1, a phosphatase that provides intracellular 
inorganic phosphate to generate PPi23, and by glycoproteins such as 
osteopontin, which inhibits crystal nucleation on collagen fibers in 
mineralizing vesicles24,25. Multiple growth factors such as TGF-β, 
activin A, bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2), insulin-like growth 
factor-1, fibroblast growth factor-2 and fibroblast growth factor-23 
are involved in bone and/or cartilage mineralization26–34. A common 
signaling pathway engaged by these factors is the RAS-ERK pathway, 
which is constitutively activated in cells lacking neurofibromin, the 
RAS GTPase–activating protein (RAS-GAP) encoded by NF1 (ref. 35). 
We thus hypothesized that neurofibromin, via its inhibitory action 
on RAS-ERK signaling in bone-forming cells, could be an important 
regulator of bone matrix mineralization and bone mechanical proper-
ties. We show here that neurofibromin inhibits the expression of genes 
increasing PPi extracellular levels and that hydrolysis of excess PPi 
with a recombinant form of ALP improves bone growth and minerali-
zation in mouse models of NF1 skeletal dysplasia. These data suggest 
a potential pharmacological avenue to prevent some of the skeletal 
abnormalities of individuals with NF1.

RESULTS
Uncontrolled PPi production in Nf1-deficient bone cells
To address whether and how Nf1 regulates bone mineralization, we 
first asked whether Nf1 ablation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) 
affects  extracellular  PPi  concentrations.  BMSCs  from  Col2-Nf1  
KO  mice,  lacking  Nf1  in  osteochondroprogenitor  cells,  showed  a 
60–70%  lower  Nf1  expression  compared  to  those  from  wild-type 
(WT) mice (Fig. 1a), consistent with the heterogeneous nature of 
the cell populations that comprise BMSC cultures36. This lower Nf1 
expression level was accompanied by a significantly higher (70%) 
extracellular  PPi  concentration  in  the  conditioned  medium  of

undifferentiated BMSC cultures compared to that of WT controls 
(Fig. 1b). Addition of a recombinant form of ALP, in the form of 
sALP-FcD10 (also known as asfotase-α, 0.5 µg ml−1) to induce PPi 
hydrolysis significantly reduced the amount of PPi detected in both 
genotypes, confirming the validity of the PPi measurements.

High extracellular PPi concentration can be generated by increased 
production  of  PPi  by  the  ectonucleophosphatase  ENPP1  and  by 
increased cellular export through the transporter ANK. Both Ank 
and Enpp1 mRNA (Fig. 1c) and protein (Supplementary Fig. 1a) 
levels were higher in Nf1-deficient BMSCs compared to WT BMSCs. 
Expression of the gene encoding osteopontin (Spp1) was also higher 
in Nf1-deficient BMSCs (Fig. 1c), consistent with the reported stimu-
latory effect of PPi on Spp1 expression25. We obtained similar results 
when comparing Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitor cells generated from 
Nf1flox/flox BMSC cultures infected with a Cre-expressing adenovirus 
to control Nf1flox/flox BMSC cultures infected with a GFP-expressing  
adenovirus  (Supplementary  Fig.  1b),  which  confirmed  that  the 
changes in gene expression measured in BMSCs from Col2-Nf1 KO 
mice  were  not  caused  by  fewer  osteoprogenitors  initially  plated.  
Ank, Enpp1 and Spp1 expression was also significantly higher in long 
bones, calvarias and epiphyses (cartilage) from 3-week-old Col2-Nf1  
KO  versus  WT  mice  (Fig.  1d),  whereas  expression  of  Runx2 
and  Alpl,  two  osteoblast  differentiation  marker  genes,  was  lower 
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Lastly, MEK inhibition by U0126 (1 µM, 24 h)  
blunted the increase in Ank, Enpp1 and Spp1 expression observed in 
Nf1-deficient BMSCs, indicating that neurofibrin controls the express-
ion of these genes in a RAS/ERK-dependent fashion (Fig. 1c and 
Supplementary Fig. 1b).

To assess whether these molecular findings in mice could be repli-
cated in humans, we obtained RNA from adherent human bone stromal  
cells prepared from bone biopsies from six healthy control subjects 
without NF1 and nine individuals with NF1 tibial pseudarthrosis, and 
measured ENPP1 and ANKH transcript levels by quantitative PCR. 
Consistent with the mouse data, ENPP1 expression was significantly 
higher in cultured cells from NF1 pseudarthrosis tissues (Fig. 1e), 
despite the small number of available samples and consistent with 
the cell heterogeneity of these cultures. ANKH expression, however,

was variable between samples and not significantly different between 
cultures from normal and NF1 pseudarthrosis biopsies (Fig. 1f).

Mice lacking Nf1 in mature osteoblasts (Col1-Nf1 KO mice) have a 
uniform distribution of nonmineralized matrix throughout trabecular 
bone compartments18, whereas mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondropro-
genitors and chondrocytes (Col2-Nf1 KO mice) are characterized by 
an osteoid preferentially distributed in the primary spongiosa, where 
osteoblasts and chondrocytes mineralize their matrix (Fig. 2a). On the 
basis of these observations and because neurofibromin is expressed in 
hypertrophic chondrocytes37,38, we hypothesized that this RAS-GAP 
could also contribute to cartilage mineralization, which is a process 
important for bone growth and ossification during development and 
bone healing in adults. In support of this hypothesis, Col2-Nf1 KO 
chondrocyte high-density micromass cultures generated a typical 
Alcian blue–positive matrix but did not show signs of mineralization, 
in contrast to WT chondrocyte cultures (Fig. 2b). In addition, Ank, 
Enpp1 and Spp1 expression was significantly higher in Nf1-deficient 
micromass chondrocyte cultures versus WT cultures (Fig. 2c), in 
agreement with the data obtained from cartilaginous epiphyses, which 
contain a high proportion of chondrocytes (Fig. 1d). Accordingly, 
extracellular PPi concentration (Fig. 2d) and Enpp1 enzymatic activity  
(Fig. 2e) were significantly higher, whereas ALP activity was lower 
(Fig. 2f) in Nf1-deficient versus WT chondrocytes.

Lack of Nf1 in BMSCs impairs BMP2 osteogenic action
BMSCs  isolated  from  Col2-Nf1  KO  mice  displayed,  compared  to 
BMSCs isolated from WT mice, a significantly lower differentiation 
potential, as determined by lower osteoblast colony-forming unit 
(CFU-Ob) number, lower tissue-nonspecific ALP activity (Fig. 3a) 
and lower expression of osteoblast differentiation markers includ-
ing Runx2, Alpl and Bglap, the gene encoding osteocalcin (Fig. 3b). 
We obtained similar results using Nf1flox/flox BMSCs infected with a 
Cre-expressing adenovirus (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). However, in 
contrast to what we observed in the case of Ank and Enpp1 expression, 
MEK inhibition by U0126 (1 µM), tremetinib or PD198306 (0.1 µM 
and 200 nM, respectively, data not shown) for 24 h did not correct the 
expression level of Runx2 or Alpl in Nf1-deficient BMSCs (Fig. 3c),  
indicating  that  the  expression  of  these  two  genes  is  not  directly  
controlled by neurofibromin. Extracellular PPi concentration, as well 
as Ank, Enpp1 and Spp1 expression, remained above or equal to that of 
WT controls throughout the differentiation period (Fig. 3d,e).

BMPs  are  known  for  their  ability  to  promote  osteoprogenitor  
differentiation39 but have had limited effects on the differentiation  
of Nf1-heterozygous osteoprogenitors and on bone union in Nf1- 
heterozygous mice40,41. Recombinant human BMP2 (100 ng ml−1) 
did not stimulate ALP activity or CFU-Ob formation in BMSC cul-
tures from Col2-Nf1 KO mice, although it did, as expected, promote

CFU-Ob formation and ALP activity in WT BMSC cultures following  
2 weeks of treatment (Fig. 4a). Smad1 and Smad5 phosphorylation 
in response to BMP2 treatment (100 ng ml−1, 1 h) was not affected 
by Nf1 deficiency (Fig. 4b), indicating that the lack of stimulatory 
effect of BMP2 on Nf1-deficient BMSC differentiation is not caused 
by repression of BMP2 receptor expression or by the production of 
factors inhibiting canonical Smad signaling. Treatment with BMP2 
for 2 weeks also failed to increase the expression of Alpl, Runx2 and 
Col1a1 in BMSC cultures from Col2-Nf1 KO mice (Fig. 4c). However, 
it significantly increased the expression of Ank and Enpp1 (but not 
Spp1) (Fig. 4d) and PPi extracellular concentration (Fig. 4e) in both 
WT  and  Nf1-deficient  BMSCs.  CFU-Ob  formation,  ALP  activity  
(Fig. 4f,g) and the expression of Alpl and Col1a1 (Supplementary  
Fig. 2a,b) in Nf1-deficient BMSC cultures were higher following a 
2-week-long  combined  treatment  with  the  MEK  inhibitor  U0126  
(1 µM) and BMP2 (100 ng ml−1), but not with either of these treat-
ments alone. This combination treatment also partially reduced the 
increased Ank and Enpp1 expression and PPi extracellular concentra-
tion detected in vehicle-treated Nf1-deficient BMSC cultures, possibly 
owing to the antagonistic effect of these two drugs on Ank and Enpp1 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).

sALP-FcD10 improves bone growth and mineral density in  
Col2-Nf1 KO mice
If excessive extracellular PPi levels cause the mineralization deficit 
observed  in  Col2-Nf1  KO  mice,  then  reducing  PPi  concentration 
should  have  beneficial  effects  on  matrix  mineralization.  This  is 
experimentally possible by inhibiting PPi generation or increasing 
its catabolism. We chose the latter approach because PPi is a substrate 
for ALP, and a recombinant form of human ALP is clinically available 
to treat ALPL-deficient subjects with hypophosphatasia42,43. We thus 
treated WT and Nf1-deficient BMSCs with vehicle or sALP-FcD10 

(0.5 mg ml−1) in osteogenic conditions for 14 d and assessed matrix 
mineralization. As predicted, sALP-FcD10 increased matrix miner-
alization in both genotypes, although the relative increase was more 
pronounced in cultures from Col2-Nf1 KO than in those from WT 
mice (Fig. 5a). This pronounced increase occurred despite the persist-
ent differentiation deficit of Nf1-deficient BMSCs in the presence of 
sALP-FcD10 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Treatment with sALP-FcD10 
reduced Spp1 expression in Nf1-deficient BMSCs (Supplementary 
Fig. 3a), in agreement with the known stimulatory effect of PPi on 
Spp1 expression25.

On the basis of these encouraging results, we treated Col2-Nf1 KO 
newborn mice daily with subcutaneous injections of sALP-FcD10  
(8.2 mg per kg body weight per d) for 18 d44,45. Col2-Nf1 KO mice have 
short stature, low bone mass, decreased bone mineralization, cortical 
thickness and mineral density, and high cortical porosity37. Following 
this short treatment (dictated by the relatively high death rate of these 
mice at weaning), we observed a significant 73% increase in the size of 
mutant mice (Fig. 5b) and a clear increase in vertebral and tibial bone 
mineral density on radiographs (Fig. 5c,d). Treatment with sALP-
FcD10 also significantly increased mid-diaphyseal cortical bone thick-
ness, as measured by three-dimensional microcomputed tomography 
(µCT) (Fig. 5e), partially rescued the formation of secondary ossifica-
tion centers, expanded tibia metaphyseal envelopes and increased the 
amount of calcified matrix in the growth plate hypertrophic zone of 
Col2-Nf1 KO mice (Fig. 5f). Despite the seemingly pronounced effects 
of sALP-FcD10 observed by radiography and µCT, tibia cortical tis-
sue mineral density and mineral-to-collagen ratio (Supplementary  
Fig. 3b,c) were not increased following treatment.

was also lower in Osx-Nf1 KO mice, and femurs from Osx-Nf1 KO 
mice were mechanically weaker than those from WT controls, as 
measured by three-point bending tests (Supplementary Table 2).

To assess the effect of sALP-FcD10 on the skeleton of this mouse 
model, we administered sALP-FcD10 daily from 2 weeks of age (at the 
time of Nf1 ablation) for 6 weeks. In Osx-Nf1 KO mice, treatment with 
sALP-FcD10 significantly increased trabecular bone volume/tissue 
volume ratio and moment of inertia, as assessed by µCT (Fig. 6c,f), 
as well as femoral stiffness, modulus and peak force, as measured 
by three-point bending (Supplementary Table 2), and led to a non-
significant trend for increased cortical femoral thickness (Fig. 6e).  
Treatment  with  sALP-FcD10  also  improved  bone  mineralization 
in  Osx-Nf1  KO  mice,  as  measured  by  a  drastic  73%  reduction  in  
osteoid volume per bone volume, a 65% reduction in osteoid surface 
per bone surface, a 53% decrease in osteoid thickness (Fig. 6b) and a 
20% increase in mineral-to-collagen ratio (Fig. 6h).

DISCUSSION
We show here that the RAS-GAP activity of neurofibromin in the 
bone mesenchymal lineage restrains the expression of Enpp1 and Ank, 
two main genes controlling PPi homeostasis, and that increasing PPi 
catabolism  through  enzyme  therapy  considerably  improves  bone 
mineralization and bone mechanical properties in mouse models of 
NF1 skeletal dysplasia. These results, along with suggestive evidence 
of conservation of function between mice and humans, support the 
causal role of increased PPi levels in the etiology of NF1-related hyper-
osteoidosis and position neurofibromin as a critical and obligatory 
regulator of cartilage and bone mineralization. They also provide  
preclinical  evidence  that  some  of  the  most  clinically  challenging  
NF1-related skeletal maladies might be preventable.

Hyperactive TGF-β signaling has been proposed to cause bone loss 
and to delay bone healing in mice deficient for Nf1 in mature osteoblasts 
and heterozygous for Nf1 (ref. 19). TGF-β is also known to stimulate 
ERK activity and Ank and Enpp1 expression, and to increase PPi con-
centration in WT chondrocytes48,49. Therefore, NF1-deficient BMSCs 
may contribute cell autonomously and/or in a hyperactive TGF-β para-
crine fashion to the extraphysiological skeletal accumulation of PPi and 
to the impaired osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization 
observed in the setting of NF1. The beneficial effect of sALP-FcD10 
on bone growth, mineralization and strength observed in this study  
suggests that PPi accumulation and abnormal mineralization are important  
components of NF1-related bone dysplasia. However, further studies 
will be necessary to determine the evolution and contribution of all 
the cellular defects typical of Nf1-deficient bone cells on bone mass 
and strength over extended periods of treatment with sALP-FcD10, 
as this drug does not correct the differentiation phenotype of Nf1-
deficient osteoblasts. Although TGF-β blockade might theoretically 
be used to promote bone union in children with NF1 pseudarthrosis, 
the cancer-prone status of this pediatric population and the known 
tumor-suppressor activity of TGF-β signaling limit this therapeutic 
approach50. Our results, on the other hand, suggest that stimulation 
of PPi catabolism through enzyme therapy could be applied on a more 
chronic basis before fracture to strengthen the NF1-related dysplastic 
bones and prevent their mechanical failure.

The  mineralization  deficit  of  Nf1-deficient  BMSCs  could  be 
detected  in  immature  BMSCs  before  their  differentiation  into  
osteoblasts. Therefore, this phenotype cannot be attributed to the 
reduced differentiation potential of Nf1-deficient BMSCs, although 
the  latter  certainly  contributes  to  the  low  bone  mass  phenotype 
observed  in  the  two  NF1  mouse  models  used  in  this  study.  It  is 

also worth noting that BMP2 treatment, without the need for ERK 
blockade, stimulated the expression of Ank and Enpp1 and increased 
extracellular PPi concentration in Nf1-deficient BMSC cultures, as 
shown previously in WT cells28. This observation could explain why 
recombinant human BMP2 alone did not improve bone healing in 
NF1 mouse models40,41 and bone union in individuals with NF1-
related pseudarthrosis51–53.

Our results indicate that Nf1-deficient BMSCs are not responsive 
to BMP2 with regard to their differentiation potential and suggest 
that this defect may in part underlie their inability to differentiate. In 
addition, the response of Nf1-deficient BMSCs to BMP2 with regard 
to Ank and Enpp1 expression suggests that neurofibromin is not the 
sole negative regulator of the RAS-ERK signaling pathway upstream 
of these two genes. These results also indicate that the stimulatory 
effect of BMP2 on osteoprogenitor differentiation requires controlled 
ERK signaling by neurofibromin.

It is unknown to what extent poor matrix mineralization contrib-
utes to the low bone mineral density, tibia bowing, poor mechanical 
properties and possibly pseudarthrosis observed in children with 
NF1. Although local PPi concentration could not be quantified, the 
observed increase in the expression of ENPP1 in BMSCs extracted 
from biopsies of pseudarthroses from patients with NF1, as well as the 
presence of thick osteoid seams on histological sections20, supports 
conservation of function between mice and humans.

Pseudarthrosis and dystrophic scoliosis can currently be treated only 
by invasive, and often repetitive, surgical orthopedic interventions2,3. 
Most approaches to date are corrective in nature, and only bracing 
techniques are available to reduce the incidence and severity of these 
complications. Of major interest is the possibility that sALP-FcD10, if 
applied preventatively, might improve mineralization, growth, archi-
tecture and mechanical properties of dysplastic bones affected by NF1 
and, thus, limit their likelihood of deformation and fracture. This latter 
point is particularly noteworthy, as the current standard for treatment 
is limited to avoidance of prophylactic surgery and early long-term 
bracing to prevent fracture until skeletal maturity is reached. It is worth 
emphasizing that sALP-FcD10 targets bone and is already successfully 
used in the clinic to treat children with hypophosphatasia42. Therefore, 
its potential use in the context of NF1-related skeletal dysplasia has an 
advantage over the development of other experimental drugs that target 
this and other aspects of the NF1 skeletal pathologies.

Animals  and  drugs.  All  procedures  were  approved  by  the  Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC). WT and Col2-Nf1 KO mice were generated by crossing Nf1flox/flox  
mice  and  Nf1flox/+;  α1(II)  collagen-Cre  breeders47,54.  Nf1flox/flox  mice 
and Nf1flox/flox mice; α1(II) collagen-Cre mice were used as WT and KO, 
respectively. Osx-Nf1 KO mice were generated by breeding doxycycline-fed  
Osx-cre; Nf1flox/flox mice with Nf1flox/flox breeders47. All mice were on a C57BL/6 
background. Bone analyses were performed in 18-d-old or 2-month-old male 
and female mice, as indicated in figure legends. sALP-FcD10 (Asfotase Alfa, 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals) was described previously55. Briefly, mineral-targeting  
recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALP, sALP-FcD10) was 
produced in CHO cells by modifying the coding sequence of human ALPL. 
The GPI anchor sequence of the hydrophobic C-terminal domain of human 
ALPL was removed to generate a soluble, secreted enzyme (sALP). Then the 
human ALPL ectodomain sequence was extended with the coding sequence 
encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 (Fc). Finally the C terminus of the 
Fc region was extended with ten aspartic acid residues (D10). The dose of  
8.2 mg kg−1 per day was selected because it was previously shown to be effi-
cacious in short-term (16 days) efficacy study in Alpl−/− mice55. The specific 
activity of the lot used in the present study was 878 U mg−1. sALP-FcD10 was 
administered subcutaneously for the periods of time indicated in the text.

Human subjects. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic 
Institute (Bologna, Italy) and of Vanderbilt University. The parents of the sub-
jects provided informed consent. Bone tissues were obtained from 9 patients 
with NF1 and tibial pseudarthrosis (aged between 7 months and 18 years), and 
control samples were obtained from 6 children without NF1 who underwent 
surgery for congenital dysplasia of the hip without any other coexisting pathol-
ogy (n = 3)56 or scoliosis (n = 3) (aged between 3.3 and 17 years). Diagnosis of 
pseudarthrosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings. Diagnosis of 
NF1 was performed according to the criteria presented at the National Institutes 
of Health Consensus Development Conference on Neurofibromatosis (http://
consensus.nih.gov/1987/1987Neurofibramatosis064html.htm).

Cell culture. Mouse BMSCs were extracted from long bones by spinning down 
diaphyses at 1,500 r.p.m. for 3 min. Cells were then counted, plated at a density 
of 1 × 106 cells/well (12-well plates) or 2 × 106 cells/well (6-well plates) and 
grown for 7 days in αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin,  
100 µg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Manassas, VA, USA). At day 7, differentiation 
and mineralization was induced by the addition of 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and  
10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and the medium was refreshed every 2–3 days. 
BMSC differentiation and mineralization were assessed by ALP activity and 
Alizarin red S staining, respectively, using standard protocols.

Primary chondrocytes were extracted from 4-day-old pup rib bones. The car-
tilaginous part of the rib was dissected and soft tissues removed, then digested by 
collagenase D (3 mg/ml, Roche, USA) and 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (EDTA) (Gibco, 
USA) in DMEM for 3 h. At confluence, 5 × 10 µl drops of concentrated cells  
(2 × 107 cells/ml) were plated in 6 wells. After 2 h of incubation, 2 ml of complete 
cell culture medium was delicately added. Cells were differentiated in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin, 
50 µg ml−1 of ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate.

Human cells extracted from bone marrow56 or bone tissue were maintained 
in alpha MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 0.1 mg ml−1 
streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Cells from bone 
tissues were digested overnight with collagenase before plating. After 4 days, 
nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent bone cells were grown until 
confluence or passaged before RNA extraction.

Adenovirus infection of bone marrow stromal cells. BMSCs were isolated 
from Nf1flox/flox mice and seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well 
plates. At 40% confluence, cells were incubated in complete culture medium 
(α-MEM, 10% FBS and 100 IU ml−1 penicillin) containing either Ad5-CMV-
GFP or Ad5-CMV-Cre (Vector development lab, Baylor College of Medicine) 

at  2.5  ×  109  PFUs.  After  2  days  of  incubation,  the  medium  was  refreshed  
with complete culture medium. Nf1 recombination efficiency was determined 
according to Wang et al.37.

Serum vitamin D, calcium and phosphate assays. Blood samples were collected 
from WT and Osx-Nf1 KO mice at sacrifice. Vitamin D, phosphate and cal-
cium concentration in mouse serum was determined using a 25OH-Vitamin-D  
ELISA Assay kit (Eagle Biosciences, cat# VID31-K01), a Phosphate Assay kit 
(BioVision, cat # k410-500) and a Calcium Assay kit (BioVision, cat# k380-250), 
respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PPi and PC-1 assays. PPi release in cell-conditioned medium (ePPi) was meas-
ured  radiometrically  using  differential  adsorption  on  activated  charcoal  of 
uridine-diphospho-d-glucose [6-3H] (Cat #NET1163250UC, PerkinElmer) as 
previously described49,57,58. Forty microliters of conditioned medium (or blank 
control) and 120 µl of assay solution (57 nM of Tris acetate, pH 7.6; 5.2 mM MgAc; 
18.6 µM glucose 1,6-diphosphate (G1,6DP); 9 µM uridine-diphosphoglucose  
(UDPG);  4  µM  β-nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide 
(NAD+);  
0.136 U uridine-diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPGPP); 0.5 U phos-
phoglucomutase; 0.5 U glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); 0.02 µCi 
3H-UDPG) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then adsorbed on 200 µl of char-
coal for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 10 min, 100 µl  
of the supernatant was transferred into a vial containing 5 ml of Bio-safe II for 
radioactivity count. PPi levels were normalized by protein concentration in cell 
lysates in each well. Measurements were performed in triplicate and similar 
results were obtained from at least 3 independent experiments.

ENPP1 activity was determined using 1.5 mM of the synthetic chromogenic 
substrate thymidine 5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester in reaction buffer 
(100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 130 mM NaCl, and 15 mM MgCl2) incubated at  
37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 µl 4 N NaOH. 
Product formation was monitored by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm.  
ENPP1 activity in each well was normalized by cell number. Measurements were 
performed in triplicate and from at least 3 independent experiments.

RT-qPCR and genomic PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, 
Grand Island, NY, USA), and cDNAs were synthesized from 1 µg of RNA follow-
ing DNase I treatment using the high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit 
(Applied Biosystems, USA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by using 
TaqMan or SYBR green gene expression assays. The probe and primer sets for mouse 
Runx2 (Mm00501578_m1); Alpl (Mm00475834_m1); Ank (Mm00445047_m1);  
Enpp1 (Mm00501097_m1); Spp1 (Mm00436767_m1), Igf1 (Mm01228180_m1), 
human ANKH (Hs00219798_m1) and human ENPP1 (Hs01054040_m1) and 
the normalizers Hprt (Mm00446968_m1); human GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1)  
were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). The SYBR  
green primers were Spp1 (forward; CTCCTTGCGCCACAGAATG, reverse;  
TGGGCAACAGGGATGACA), Nf1 (forward; GTATTGAATTGAAGCACC 
TTTGTTTGG,  reverse;  CTGCCCAAGGCTCCCCCAG);  Bglap  (forward;  
ACCCTGGCTGCGCTCTGTCTCT, reverse; GATGCGTTTGTAGGCGGTC 
TTCA)  and  Col1a1  (forward;  GACATCCCTGAAGTCAGCTGC,  reverse; 
TCCCTTGGGTCCCTCGAC). Specificity of amplification was verified by the 
presence of a single peak on the dissociation curve. Amplification conditions are 
available upon request. Measurements were performed in triplicate and from at 
least 3 independent experiments.

For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from tail tips by sodium hydrox-
ide digestion, and PCR was performed using primers P1, P2 and P4, as described 
by Zhu et al.47. The Col2a1-cre transgene was detected using the fwd: GAGTT
GATAGCTGGCTGGTGGCAGATG and reverse: TCCTCCTGCTCCTAGGG
CCTCCTGCAT primers.

Western blot analyses. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electro-
phoresis according to standard protocols. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed 
with the indicated antibody using standard protocols (monoclonal anti-β-actin 
antibody (Sigma cat# AC-74, dilution 1:5,000), anti-pSmad1/5 antibody (Cell 
Signaling cat#9516S, dilution 1:1,000), anti-Smad1/Smad5 antibody (Abcam

calculated by accounting for structure by using cross-sectional area and moment 
of inertia as measured by µCT.

Histology. Static histomorphometry measurements were performed as previ-
ously described in accordance with standard nomenclature59, using the Bioquant 
Analysis System (Nashville, TN, USA) on 5 µm undecalcified methymethacr-
ylate sections. Calcified cartilage BV/TV was measured in the growth plate 
hypertrophic region following von Kossa and van Gieson staining.

X-rays and mCT analyses. Radiographs were obtained using a digital cabinet 
X-ray system (LX-60, Faxitron X-Ray, USA). µCT analyses were performed 
using a Scanco µCT 40 system (Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). 
Tomographic images were acquired at 55 kVp and 145 mA with an isotropic 
voxel size of 12 µm and at an integration time of 250 ms with 500 projections 
collected per 180° rotation.

Raman spectroscopy. Sensitive to the vibrational modes of chemical bonds, 
Raman spectroscopy (RS) characterizes the biochemical properties of bone  
tissue, namely mineral-to-collagen ratio (MCR) and crystal structure. Using 
midshaft vessel perforations as landmarks, spectra were obtained from cortical 
bone of the femur with 5 accumulations of 20 s exposures to a 20-mW, near-
infrared laser (785 nm) at a spot size of ~1.5 µm in diameter. Spectra were 
processed via least-squares modified polynomial fit to suppress background 
fluorescence60 and smoothed for noise using a second-order Savitsky-Golay 
filter61. Raman shift calibration was accomplished using a neon lamp and a sili-
con standard. Silicon standard measurements before and after data acquisition 
ensured wave number consistency across bones. Spectral intensities for known 
Raman peaks and peak ratios were extracted using custom Matlab software 
(Mathworks, Natick, MA) to measure mineralization as ν1 phosphate (symmet-
rical stretching at ~960 cm−1) per proline (ring at ~854 cm−1) and crystallinity  
(crystal grain size and perfection) as the inverse full width at half maximum 
intensity of the ν1 phosphate peak).

Biomechanical testing. Hydrated samples were tested in three-point bending 
with a span of 8 mm at a rate of 3 mm min−1 (ref. 62). Force and displacement 
were measured from a 100 N load cell and from the linear variable displacement 
transformer of the material testing system (Dynamight 8841, Instron, Canton, 
OH). Structural properties were extracted from force-displacement curves by 
custom Matlab algorithms (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Material properties were 

Statistical analyses. Depending on whether data per group passed the Shapiro-
Wilk normality test or whether standard deviations were not different among the 
groups (Bartlett’s test), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-
Wallis Test (nonparametric) was used to determine whether differences existed 
in µCT -, Raman- and biomechanical-derived properties among the experimen-
tal groups. When differences existed at P < 0.05, post hoc pair-wise comparisons 
were tested for significance in which the P value was adjusted (Padj < 0.05) by 
Holm-Sidak’s method or Dunn’s method (nonparametric). Statistical analysis 
was performed using GraphPad PRISM (v6.0a, La Jolla, CA). Data are provided 
as mean ± s.d. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size.  
The investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome 
assessment. The experiments were not randomized.
