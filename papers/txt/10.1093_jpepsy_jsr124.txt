Objective This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to determine how cognitive, disease, and environ-
mental variables relate to social–emotional functioning in youth with NF1 and plexiform
neurofibromas. Methods Psychological assessments were administered to 53 children (mean age
12.4 years); parents and teachers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children—Second Edition
(BASC-2). Disease severity was quantified by nurse–practitioner ratings and tumor burden, and parents
completed a life events checklist to indicate environmental stressors. Results Notable proportions of
children scored in the at-risk/clinically significant ranges on several parent and teacher BASC-2 subscales
including Somatization, Attention Problems, Depression, and Withdrawal. Combinations of cognitive, disease,
and environmental variables predicted scores on parent BASC-2 Internalizing Problems, Behavior Symptoms
Index, and Adaptive Skills composites. Conclusions Cognitive, disease, and environmental variables
relate to social–emotional outcomes in children with NF1. These youth may benefit from interventions target-
ing social skills, cognitive functioning, and adaptive ways of coping with NF1-related pain.

Key words

chronic illness; psychosocial functioning; social skills and development.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder
caused by a mutation on chromosome 17. The disease
affects approximately 1 in 3,500 individuals, and can be
inherited by an autosomal dominant transmission or come
about through spontaneous mutation (Tonsgard, 2006).

Common clinical manifestations
macules, skin-fold freckling, cutaneous and plexiform neu-
rofibromas, scoliosis, and optic gliomas (Gutmann et al.,
1997). Currently, there are no effective treatments other
than surgical removal of the tumors, which is often com-
plicated by the involvement of nearby nerve tissue, and
tumor regrowth is common (Tonsgard, 2006). In addition,
involvement of the central nervous system is frequent, with
30–65% of these children having cognitive impairments

include

(North et al., 1997). Areas of deficits include visual-spatial
skills (Levine, Materek, Abel, O’Donnell, & Cutting, 2006;
Schrimsher, Billingsley, Slopis, & Moore, 2003) and exec-
utive functions such as planning and working memory
(Payne, Hyman, Shores, & North, 2011; Roy et al.,
2010). Furthermore, rates of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities (LDs) are higher
in youth with NF1 compared to unaffected siblings and the
general population (Koth, Cutting, & Denckla, 2000;
Mautner, Kluwe, Thakker, & Leark, 2002).

Social-Emotional Functioning in Youth with NF1

The physical and neurocognitive symptoms of NF1 put
children with this disorder at risk for a myriad of social–
emotional problems, but very few studies have addressed

this topic. Initial evidence indicates that children with NF1
experience more problems with social skills, anxiety,
depression, and aggressive behavior compared to norma-
tive means and unaffected siblings on the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL; Barton & North, 2004; Johnson, Saal,
Lovell, & Schorry, 1999). In one of the first reports on this
topic, Dilts and colleagues (1996) found that parents and
teachers both rated children with NF1 as significantly
worse than their unaffected siblings on the Social
Problems subscale of the CBCL. Furthermore, parent and
teacher ratings placed one-third or more of the children in
the clinically significant range on this subscale. More
recently, Barton and North (2004) found a difference
between children with NF1 and their sibling pairs on the
same CBCL subscale, but only on the parent
form.
In another study, children with NF1 and their parents
both reported impairments
in various domains of
health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), including social,
emotional, and cognitive functioning (Graf, Landolt,
Mori, & Boltshauser, 2006). In contrast, a recent study
reported no differences between preschool-aged children
with NF1 and unaffected peers on any BASC scales other
than Somatization, but the proportion of children scoring

Factors contributing to social–emotional outcomes in
children with NF1 can be considered within a systemic and
social–ecological model. According to Kazak (1989), such
an approach necessitates consideration of numerous vari-
ables that may influence psychological well-being in a child
with chronic illness. Among these are internal variables,
such as disease severity, and external variables, such as
‘‘ongoing daily issues that the child and family face’’
(Kazak, 1989, p. 25). This model has been applied to chil-
dren with illnesses such as cancer (Shapiro, Perez, &
Warden, 1998), diabetes (Naar-King et al., 2006), and
HIV infection (Hosek et al., 2008). Given the central ner-
vous system (CNS) involvement in NF1, cognitive func-
tioning should be included as a potential influence also.
Thus, we put
framework whereby
cognitive functioning, disease severity, and environmental
stressors may contribute to social–emotional wellbeing in
children with NF1.

Relationship Between Social–Emotional
Functioning and Neurocognitive Variables

Two recent studies highlighted the relationship between
neurocognitive variables and psychological wellbeing in
children with NF1. First, Huijbregts and de Sonneville
(2010) found significant correlations between cognitive
control (e.g.,
inhibitory control and working memory)

social

functioning,

and parent-reported emotional problems and social skills
in a sample of 30 children with NF1. In the second study
(Noll et al., 2007), neurological severity (based on variables
such as the presence of absence of seizures, ADHD/LD,
and behavior problems) was associated with multiple indi-
ces of
including
parent-reported externalizing symptoms, child-reported de-
pression, and peer-reported measures of popularity and
isolation. The authors concluded that children with NF1
who have neurological involvement, particularly those with
attention and learning problems, are most at risk for social
and emotional problems.

Relationship Between Social–emotional
Functioning and Disease Severity

Given the complicated symptom profiles in NF1, it is rea-
sonable to conceive that disease severity could impact
children’s social–emotional functioning. Plexiform neuro-
fibromas (PNs), present in 30–50% of patients with NF1
(Friedrich, Schmelzle, Hartmann, Funsterer, & Mautner,
2005; Gutmann et al., 1997), are benign tumors that can
be disfiguring and limit physical functioning. Children with
PNs report a high frequency (Kim et al., 2009) and severity
(Burns et al., 2011) of pain, which can negatively impact
quality of life (Page et al., 2006). Other NF1-related symp-
toms that can impact psychological well-being and/or qual-
ity of life include scoliosis (Reichel & Schanz, 2003), optic
pathway gliomas (Wolkenstein et al., 2009), and visible or
disfiguring manifestations of the disease (Page et al., 2006).
Barton and North (2004) found no significant differences
in parent- or teacher-rated social skills between kids with
minimal/mild symptoms versus moderate/severe symp-
toms, although children in the moderate/severe group
rated themselves as having significantly poorer social
skills than children in the minimal/mild symptom group.

Relationship Between Social–Emotional
Functioning and Stressful Life Events

In addition to the potential contributions of cognitive and
disease variables, environmental factors may impact social–
emotional functioning in children with NF1. Stressful life
events have been shown to increase the risk of negative
psychological outcomes, including internalizing and exter-
nalizing disorders, in community samples of children and
adolescents (Tiet et al., 2001). Moreover, life events during
adolescence increase the risk of depression in adulthood
(Pine, Cohen, Johnson, & Brook, 2002). A few studies
have explored this topic among youth with chronic illness.
Elliott-Desorbo et al. (2009) found that school-related
events
significantly predicted
self-reported depression in children and adolescents with

in the last 6 months

HIV infection. The potential impact of stressful life events
on the functioning of youth with NF1 has not been
addressed in the literature to date.

Study Objectives

Initial studies indicate that problems exist in the social–
emotional functioning of youth with NF1, and preliminary
evidence suggests that cognitive and disease variables may
play a role in these problems. The current study seeks to
further explore the relationship of cognitive and disease
functioning. Based on a
variables to social–emotional
systems/social–ecological
framework, we incorporate an
assessment of environmental stressors as a third potential
influence on social–emotional wellbeing, thus allowing for a
more broad exploration of the variables influencing social–
emotional functioning in these children. Determining the
potential relationship of these variables to social–emotional
functioning can help guide the development of effective
interventions. Also, by specifically examining a sample of
children with PNs, we provide a thorough characterization
of this subgroup of the pediatric NF1 population, which has
not been done previously in the literature.

Our primary hypothesis was that more impaired cog-
nitive functioning, worse disease severity, and more envi-
ronmental stressors would be associated with worse
parent-reported social and emotional problems
in a
sample of youth with pervasive NF1 and PNs. As a second-
ary objective, we sought to explore the ability of these
variables to predict social–emotional problems using mul-
tiple regression analyses. Other secondary objectives were
to identify specific problem areas within social–emotional
functioning, to explore associations between social–emo-
tional variables and demographic characteristics (i.e., child
age and gender, parent education), and to examine differ-
ences between parent- and teacher-reported social–emo-
tional functioning among our sample.

Methods
Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients included children and adolescents aged
6–18 years with NF1 and PNs who were enrolled on a
natural history (NH) protocol at
the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) and whose parent completed the BASC-2
during one of their psychological assessments on the NH
protocol. All patients on the NH study must have had a
diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH Consensus
Conference criteria (NF1 Cognitive Task Force, 1988) or
have had a confirmed NF1 mutation with analysis per-
formed in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Sixty of the patients
on the NH protocol were within the current sub-study’s

Measures
Demographic Variables
Demographic information was obtained through a back-
ground information form completed by a parent or legal
guardian. Parent education was used as an indicator of
socioeconomic status.

Social–Emotional Functioning
The Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children—Second
Edition (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) is an
inventory that assesses aspects of emotional and social
functioning in terms of
internalizing and externalizing
symptoms and adaptive skills. On the Parent Report and
Teacher Report forms, respondents rate the frequency of
behaviors for children ages 2 to 18 years. Raw scores on
both forms are converted to T-scores (mean ¼ 50, standard
deviation¼ 10). Scores between 60 and 69 fall in the ‘‘At
Risk’’ range, and scores of 70 or higher fall
in the
‘‘Clinically Significant’’ range.

IQ (VIQ)

Cognitive Functioning
The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)
reliably estimates cognitive functioning in children ages 6
and up (Wechsler, 1999). Verbal
and
Performance IQ (PIQ) scores, each of which has a M of
100 and SD of 15, were included in analyses. Based on
past research identifying areas of impairment in children
with NF1, several other tests were chosen for analyses. The
Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLO; Benton,
Varney, & Hamsher, 1978) is a measure of visual-spatial
perception administered to individuals 7 years and older.
Raw scores were converted to z-scores for children ages
7–14 years and 18-year olds, since normative data were
available for these age ranges. The Trails switching task
from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System
(DKEFS; Delis, Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001) was administered
to patients 8 years and older to assess mental flexibility.
From the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Fourth
Edition (WISC-IV; Wechsler, 2003), the Digits Backward
(DB) scaled score was analyzed as a measure of working
memory,

NF1 Disease Severity
To quantify disease severity, the nurse practitioner who
conducts physical examinations with patients on the nat-
ural history study completed a rating form created by the
authors. The form lists 17 diagnoses and physical compli-
cations related to NF1, including scoliosis, optic gliomas,
pseudoarthrosis, and hearing or vision impairment. Based
on retrospective chart reviews, the nurse practitioner rated
each patient for the presence (1) or absence (0) of each
diagnosis. Ratings were summed across the 17 diagnoses to
yield an overall severity score. To assess the interrater reli-
ability of the form, the research nurse who coordinated the
study and who is very familiar with the patients rated a
subset of 15 patients by conducting chart reviews. The
resulting concordance correlation coefficient (Lin, 2000)
was .81.

As a separate indicator of disease severity, the volume
of PNs was examined. Specifically, the patients’ total tumor
burden (TTB) was calculated as the sum of all PN volumes
derived from whole-body Short T1 Inversion Recovery
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, expressed as a percentage
of body weight (Solomon, Warren, Dombi, Patronas, &
Widemann, 2004). Because the TTB variable was positively
skewed, a log transformation was performed and the
resulting variable approximated a normal distribution.

Environmental Stressors
The Life Events Checklist (LEC) consists of a list of 29
potentially stressful life events. The measure was modified
from previously existing scales (Moss, Bose, Wolters, &
Brouwers, 1998). Parents indicate which events their
child experienced in the 6 months prior to the evaluation.
Items fall into the categories of Family (e.g., marriage or
divorce of parents, birth of a sibling; seven items), School
(e.g., decline in school grades, moving to a new school; six
items), Loss (e.g., death of a friend or immediate family
member; four items), and Financial (e.g., parental job loss;
three items) events

described in a prior study (Elliott-Desorbo et al., 2009).

Statistical Analyses

To test our primary hypothesis, Pearson correlations were
used to assess bivariate relationships between BASC-2

parent scores and cognitive, environmental, and disease
variables. Variables with significant bivariate correlations
with a BASC-2 composite score were entered simulta-
neously into a multiple regression model. We chose not
to use a stepwise entry method because of the exploratory
nature of the analyses. Only parent BASC-2 scores (not
teacher scores) were included in the correlation matrix to
reduce the number of analyses. To assess secondary objec-
tives, Pearson correlations were used to examine the rela-
tionship of BASC-2 parent scores with child age and parent
education;
t-tests were used to examine differences in
BASC-2 parent and teacher scores between male and
female patients. Finally, paired-sample t-tests were used
to compare differences between parent and teacher ratings
on the BASC-2 scales. Because so little is known about the
social–emotional functioning of children and adolescents
with NF1, analyses were considered exploratory and alpha
was set at .05.

Procedures

Families of children with NF1 are referred by physicians to
the NCI from around the country. The NF1 research team
also is contacted directly by parents who locate informa-
tion about ongoing studies at this center via the internet.
The facility’s Institutional Review Board approved the nat-
ural history study. Informed consent was obtained from
the patient’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment,
and minor assent was obtained from all patients age 7 years
and older. Data were collected between February 2008 and
January 2011 during outpatient clinic visits. As part of the
protocol, patients received a complete history and physical
examination by
a nurse-practitioner, during which
NF1-related symptoms and disease severity were reviewed.
Patients also were administered a baseline comprehensive
psychological evaluation that included the above measures,
and parents completed the questionnaires while their child
was being tested. In addition,
families were given the
BASC-2 teacher form and asked to give it to the child’s
teacher. Teachers were provided with a self-addressed
stamped envelope in which to return the form directly to
the researchers.

Problems (32%), and Depression (30%). Notably, only
8% of parent
ratings yielded AR/CS scores on the
Aggression and Conduct Problems subscales.

All composite and subscale scores on the Teacher
BASC-2 were within normal
limits. Like on the parent
BASC-2, more AR/CS scores were obtained on the
Internalizing Problems composite (22%) compared to the
Externalizing Problems composite (15%), but this differ-
ence was not statistically significant (t¼ 0.70, p > .05).
AR/CS scores were most prevalent on the Somatization
(41%), Withdrawal (37%), and Attention Problems (30%)
subscales. Problems with learning (25%) and study skills
(26%) also were common. Similar to results of the parent
BASC-2, relatively few of the children’s scores were in the
AR/CS range on the Aggression (15%) and Conduct
Problems (7%) subscales.

A comparison of BASC-2 results across informants in-
dicates that parent ratings were significantly lower (reflect-
ing worse functioning) than teacher ratings on the Adaptive
Skills composite (t¼ 2.41), and on the Social Skills
(t¼ 2.28) and Leadership (t¼ 2.17) subscales (p’s < .05).
No other significant differences emerged between parent
and teacher reports.

Cognitive Functioning

Table II shows the descriptive statistics for the cognitive
measures, as well as the percentage of patients scoring
more than one standard deviation below the mean for
each test. The mean Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance
IQ (PIQ) were both in the average range. On the JLO,
the mean z-score was more than one standard deviation
below the normative mean, with nearly half (47%) of the
children scoring below average. Mean scaled scores were in
the average range on the Trails switching and Digits
Backward tasks.

NF1 Disease Severity

Disease severity ratings were completed by the nurse prac-
titioner for 50 children. On the 0 to 17 scale, scores ranged
from 0 to 8 (M¼ 3.36, SD¼ 1.6; median¼ 3). In addition
to PNs, which were present in all children, the most
common NF1-related diagnoses included spinal neurofi-
bromas (75%), vision impairment (58%), and scoliosis
(57%). The least common diagnoses were chiari malforma-
tion (4%), stroke (2%), precocious puberty (2%), and
pseudoarthrosis (2%). The mean total tumor burden per-
centage (available for 43 children) was 3.5 (SD¼ 4.6), and
ranged from less than 1% to 25.0%.

Stressful Life Events

The mean number of life events endorsed by parents was
2.21 (SD¼ 1.9), with a range of 0 to 8 events experienced
in the past 6 months. The most commonly endorsed events
were being teased in school (30%) and family experiencing
financial hardship (28%).

Relationship Between Social–Emotional
Functioning and Cognitive Functioning

As hypothesized, cognitive scores were associated with
social–emotional scores. First, IQ scores were significantly
correlated with several of the BASC-2 parent clinical and
adaptive scores (Table III). Specifically, lower VIQ scores

subscales of
Withdrawal, Attention Problems, and Conduct Problems
(p < .05). In addition, children with lower VIQ and PIQ
scores had more problems indicated on the Adaptive
Skills composite (p < .01), and the Adaptive subscales
of Functional Communication (p < .01), Leadership
(p < .01), and Social Skills (p < .05). Scores on each of
the other selected cognitive indices were related to several
parent BASC-2 scores in the hypothesized direction.

Relationship Between Social–emotional
Functioning and Disease Severity

Disease variables were related to social–emotional func-
tioning, as hypothesized (Table III). Greater nurse–
practitioner-rated disease severity was associated with
worse
scores on the parent BASC-2 Internalizing
Problems composite (p < .05) and on the Somatization
subscale (p < .01). Disease severity was not related to
any other parent BASC-2 scores. Higher tumor burden per-
centages were related to higher scores on the Attention
Problems subscale on the Parent BASC-2 (p < .05).

Relationship Between Social–emotional
Functioning and Stressful Life Events

In support of our primary hypothesis, a higher number of
stressful
life events was significantly related to higher

Multiple Regression Results

Based on a priori hypotheses and the pattern of results in
the correlation matrix, three separate multiple regression
analyses were conducted to determine the influence of
cognitive, disease, and environmental variables on the
BASC-2 parent (a) Internalizing Composite, (b) Behavior
Symptoms Index, and (c) Adaptive Skills Composite.
Results are presented in Table IV. First, the combination
of Verbal IQ, disease severity, and total stressful life events
significantly predicted Internalizing Composite scores
(F¼ 6.76, p < .001; Adj R2¼ .26). Moreover, disease sever-
ity and life events each accounted for a significant amount
of unique variance (12% and 19%, respectively; p < .01).
Next, the combination of Verbal IQ, Digits Backward, and
total stressful life events significantly predicted scores on
the Behavior Symptoms Index (F¼ 7.43, p < .001; Adj.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore social–
emotional functioning among a sample of youth with NF1
and PNs. The pattern of significant correlations provides
support for our primary hypothesis. That is, cognitive

scores, disease variables, and environmental stressors all
related to social–emotional scores. Specifically, each cogni-
tive score was associated with one or more BASC-2 parent
scores, providing further support for a previously reported
(Huijbregts & de Sonneville, 2010) link between cognitive
and social–emotional functioning in children with NF1.
Notably, the Leadership and Functional Communication
subscale scores each were associated with at least four of
the five cognitive variables, indicating that these aspects of
adaptive functioning are particularly at risk among children
with NF1 and cognitive deficits. Consistent with this find-
ing, Noll et al. (2007) found that children with NF1 had
fewer reciprocated friendships and were less well liked than
healthy peers, and that unpopularity was associated with
more severe neurological symptoms. Research on nonver-
bal learning disabilities (Casey, Rourke, & Picard, 1991)
suggest that the visual-perceptual impairments evidenced
by the children in our study may relate to their weakness in
social skills. In sum, neurocognitive deficits in children
with NF1 may underlie their poor social skills, exemplified
in our study by not taking leadership roles in peer groups
and difficulty expressing themselves to others.

Cognitively, our sample performed similarly to other
studies of children with NF1 in general. For example, a
relative deficit in visual-spatial perception on the JLO test
also has been reported by Krab et al.
(2005) and
Clements-Stephens, Rimrodt, Gaur, & Cutting (2008).
However, in contrast to past studies of NF1 noting a rela-
tive impairment in working memory (Huijbregts, Swaab, &
de Sonneville, 2010; Payne et al., 2011), our sample did
not evidence such a deficit. Prior reports in the literature
on the frequency of learning problems in NF1 and the
notable percentage (25%) of
teacher-reported learning
problems in our study implicate the need for studies

assessing cognitive interventions
that several cognitive test scores predicted
The fact
social–emotional scores suggests that some of the cognitive
deficits experienced by these children may negatively
influence
although the
cross-sectional nature of our study limits causal implica-
tions. Future research should investigate whether interven-
tions targeting cognitive deficits may ameliorate some of
the social–emotional impairments in children with NF1.
Early results on computerized training techniques such
as Cogmed (McNab et al., 2009) are promising in other
illness groups. However, more data are needed and the
applicability of these techniques to NF1 has yet to be eval-
uated. Moreover, the field could benefit from exploration of
the underlying biological mechanisms linking cognitive and
social–emotional functioning in youth with NF1, as well as
comparisons of children with and without
learning
disabilities.

Nurse-practitioner rated disease severity related to
only one aspect of social–emotional functioning: parent-
reported somatization symptoms. It is worth noting that
the items on the Somatization subscale go beyond simply
experiencing physical symptoms. Many items refer to the
child complaining about and being concerned about their
symptoms. Parental response to a child’s physical com-
plaints can influence the child’s distress (Blount et al.,
1997). Thus, the way that parents of children with NF1
react to their child’s pain and complaints may mediate the
relationship between physical symptoms and social–emo-
tional outcomes. Interventions targeting chronic pain and
other physical symptoms may help patients cope with their
disease more effectively.

Higher tumor burden percentages were related to
more parent-reported attention problems in our sample.
While this specific relationship has not been reported pre-
viously, some evidence has in fact indicated the presence of
a shared neural pathway that causes both PNs and cogni-
tive problems (Weiss, Bollag, & Shannon, 1999; Wolters
et al., 2011). However, our finding should be considered
with appreciation of the complexity of PNs. In addition to
the volume of these tumors, their location is of central
importance; a small spinal or orbital tumor can cause
more severe problems than an extensive PN in a different
location. Results of these exploratory analyses are pre-
sented tentatively.

Stressful school events were associated with multiple
aspects of social–emotional functioning, including depres-
sion, anxiety, aggression, and attention problems, provid-
ing the first account of the relationship between these
variables within the NF1 population. Social problems
(e.g., being teased by peers) and behavior difficulties in

children with learning disabilities

school were common in this study. It is well-established
that
(Wiener &
Schneider, 2002) and ADHD (Murray-Close et al., 2010)
are prone to peer rejection and behavior problems. These
diagnoses may serve to elicit the stressful school events
experienced in our sample. Conversely, repeated occur-
rence of stressful school events may lead to greater inter-
nalizing and/or externalizing problems
in the child.
Healthcare professionals should be pro-active by referring
children with NF1 for psychological assessments to iden-
tify potential learning problems if they are struggling in
school. In addition, studies are needed to assess the effi-
cacy of social skills training with these children.

In line with previous reports (e.g., Barton & North,
2004), mean scores on the Parent and Teacher BASC-2
scales were all within normal limits, which initially suggests
healthy functioning.
Interestingly, mean scores within
normal limits were also reported in the BASC-2 manual
for the normative sample of children with ADHD as well
as in studies of social–emotional functioning in children
with cancer and HIV that used the BASC-2 (Malee et al.,
2011; Wolfe-Christensen et al., 2009). However, closer
inspection of our data reveals that the percentages of chil-
dren in our sample falling in the At-Risk and Clinically
Significant ranges are substantial, ranging from 11% to
32% on the Composite scales. Thus, while our overall
sample of youth with NF1 and PNs may be functioning
well, a notable subgroup is dealing with a variety of social–
emotional problems. Malee et al. (2011) utilized the parent
BASC-II to compare behavior problems in HIV perinatally
exposed children and HIV-positive children. Results were
similar to our study, with mean scores within normal limits
but substantial proportions of children in both groups with
scores in the at-risk or clinically significant ranges. In their
conclusions,
the authors emphasize the prevalence of
mental health problems in their samples, thus under-
scoring the importance of looking beyond mean scores
that may mask the problems that exist in subgroups of
children. Percentages of children scoring in clinical
ranges were not reported in the BASC-2 manual or in the
study of children with cancer noted above. Inclusion of
such information would be helpful in future studies on
social–emotional functioning in pediatric illness groups.
Furthermore, the need to focus subsequent research on
the subgroups scoring in the at-risk and clinically signifi-
cant ranges as well as on what variables contribute to their
significant scores is implicated.

Parents and teachers consistently indicated that soma-
tization, attention problems, depression, and withdrawal
are among the most significant problems in our sample.
Importantly,

lems. Similarly, in Barton & North’s (2004) study, the
mean CBCL Internalizing Problems score was slightly
higher (57.1) than the mean Externalizing Problems score
(53.0). Comparisons between our study and Barton and
North’s must be tempered since different measures were
used (BASC-2 vs. CBCL), and all children in our sample
had PNs, which may be associated with a different psycho-
logical profile (Wolters et al., 2011). The presence or
absence of PNs in Barton and North’s sample was not
reported.

Limitations and Future Directions

While the descriptive, cross-sectional nature of this study
and our lack of a comparison group limit their implica-
tions, our results nonetheless can be used for planning
future studies. Descriptive research is important in new
areas of scientific inquiry, and is particularly useful for
gathering information and generating further hypotheses
(Marincola, 2007). Our results should be interpreted in
this context. The next steps will be to explore social–emo-
tional functioning and related variables using a comparison
group, such as unaffected siblings. Comparisons of chil-
dren with NF1 with and without PNs will be important as
well, since PNs are an important aspect of disease severity.
The generalizability of our results to children without PNs
is limited.

Results of the multiple regression analyses suggest that
combinations of cognitive functioning, disease severity,
and environmental stressors may influence social–emotion-
al outcomes in children with NF1, although a longitudinal
design would lend support to a possible causal relation-
ship. The conceptual framework underlying our hypothe-
ses was guided by a systems and social-ecological model,
which has been applied to other pediatric illness groups.
This is the first time such a model has been adapted and
applied to NF1. Working from this model can help
develop a more definitive and elaborate framework that
can be tested for its applicability to NF1. However, given
our relatively small sample size and the fact that some
of the cognitive measures did not span the entire age
range of the sample, findings must be interpreted with
caution.

Inclusion of additional variables from the systems and
social-ecological model, such as coping and family func-
tioning, would be useful in future studies. Also, systems

capture developmental changes over time. Thus, research
incorporating multiple timepoints will be important

Social–emotional Functioning in Youth With NF1

Conclusions

In our sample of children and adolescents with NF1
and PNs, poorer cognitive functioning, more severe dis-
ease, and more environmental stressors all related to
social–emotional impairments. Also, while mean social–
emotional scores are within normal limits, a substantial
subgroup of children is
scoring in the At-risk or
Clinically Significant range. This descriptive study provides
a basis for further research questions regarding children
and adolescents with NF1, including (a) what physiological
etiologies contribute to their cognitive and social–emotion-
al functioning; (b) what are the potential mediators of the
relationship between cognitive, disease, and environmental
variables and social–emotional wellbeing (e.g., parental re-
sponses to child’s complaints of pain); and (c) what inter-
ventions will be effective in addressing the social–
emotional difficulties in these youth? Well-designed stud-
ies with comparison groups and the development of inter-
ventions will help to answer these questions.
