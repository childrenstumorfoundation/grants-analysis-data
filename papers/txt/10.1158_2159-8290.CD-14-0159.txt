AbstrAct

NF1 encodes a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Accordingly, aberrant RAS activa-
tion underlies the pathogenesis of NF1-mutant cancers. Nevertheless, it is unclear 
which RAS pathway components represent optimal therapeutic targets. Here, we identify mTORC1 as 
the key PI3K effector in NF1-mutant nervous system malignancies and conversely show that mTORC2 
and AKT are dispensable. However, we find that tumor regression requires sustained inhibition of both 
mTORC1 and MEK. Transcriptional profiling studies were therefore used to establish a signature of 
effective mTORC1–MEK inhibition in vivo. We unexpectedly found that the glucose transporter GLUT1 
was  potently  suppressed,  but  only  when  both  pathways  were  inhibited.  Moreover,  unlike  VHL-  and 
LKB1-mutant  cancers,  reduction  of  18F-FDG  uptake  required  the  suppression  of  both  mTORC1  and 
MEK.  Together,  these  studies  identify  optimal  and  suboptimal  therapeutic  targets  in  NF1-mutant 
malignancies and define a noninvasive means of measuring combined mTORC1–MEK inhibition in vivo, 
which can be readily incorporated into clinical trials.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that mTORC1 and MEK are key therapeutic targets in NF1-
mutant cancers and establishes a noninvasive biomarker of effective, combined target inhibition that 
can be evaluated in clinical trials. Cancer Discov; 4(9); 1062–73. ©2014 AACR.

iNtrODUctiON

The NF1 tumor suppressor is mutated or suppressed in a 
variety  of  sporadic  cancers,  including  glioblastoma,  neuro­
blastoma, melanoma, and non–small cell lung cancer (1–5). 
NF1  mutations  also  underlie  the  familial  cancer  syndrome 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; refs. 6 and 7). Patients with 
NF1  exhibit  a  variety  of  tumorigenic  and  nontumorigenic 
manifestations,  but  the  most  common  cause  of  death  is 
malignant  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumors  (MPNST).  These 
highly aggressive tumors are lethal in approximately 70% of 
patients,  and  conventional  chemotherapy  and  radiation  do 
not  reduce  mortality  in  individuals  with  inoperable  tumors 
(8–10). Therefore, developing effective targeted therapies for 
these individuals represents an important and unmet clinical 
need. Moreover, an effective therapy for this tumor type may 
be  more  broadly  applicable  to  other  sporadic  NF1­mutant 
cancers.

The  NF1  tumor  suppressor  gene  encodes  a  RAS  GTPase­
activating  protein  (GAP),  which  inactivates  RAS  by  cata­
lyzing  the  hydrolysis  of  RAS–GTP  (6,  7).  As  such,  when 
NF1  is  mutated  or  suppressed,  RAS  and  downstream  effec­
tors become hyperactivated (11). Both the PI3K–mTOR and 
MEK–ERK  pathways  have  been  shown  to  be  important  in 
various  NF1­mutant  tumors,  and  therefore  components  of 
these  pathways  represent  potential  therapeutic  targets  (12–
15).  However,  given  the  plethora  of  available  drugs  that 

target  these  pathways,  we  set  out  to  genetically  and  chemi­
cally  deconstruct  the  most  important  signaling  nodes  in 
NF1­mutant  MPNSTs.  Together  with  preclinical  studies 
in  a  genetically  engineered  mouse  tumor  model,  we  found 
that  mTOR  complex  1  (mTORC1)  is  the  key  PI3K  pathway 
component  in  these  NF1­mutant  malignancies,  AKT  and 
mTORC2 are dispensable, and only sustained mTORC1 and 
MEK inhibition promotes tumor regression.

Several combined PI3K–MEK pathway trials are in develop­
ment or are being considered for other cancers (16). However, 
the clinical challenge will be to identify a drug combination 
and  dose  that  effectively  suppresses  both  pathways,  while 
minimizing toxicity. It is currently unclear how dosing can be 
adjusted  while  confirming  that  both  targets  are  sufficiently 
inhibited  in  real  time,  especially  given  that  the  duration  of 
inhibition seems to be an important determinant of efficacy. 
Thus,  establishing  a  tractable  biomarker  for  effective,  com­
bined target inhibition would greatly facilitate this effort. By 
performing transcriptional profiling and imaging studies, we 
unexpectedly identified GLUT1, which mediates 18F­fluorode­
oxyglucose (18F­FDG) uptake, as a key gene that is suppressed 
before  tumor  regression  but  only  when  both  pathways  are 
effectively inhibited. Moreover, we show that 18F­FDG uptake 
is  a  reliable  readout  of  combined  target  inhibition.  This 
insight can be directly applied to the design of clinical trials 
in NF1-mutant cancers and may also have broader utility in 
other RAS­driven tumors.

resUlts
p110a and mTORC1 Are the Key Effectors in 
NF1-Mutant Nervous System Malignancies

We  have  previously  shown  that  loss  or  inactivation  of 
NF1 triggers the aberrant activation of PI3K–mTORC1 sig­
naling  in  human  and  mouse  MPNSTs  (17).  However,  it  is 
currently  unclear  which  specific  components  within  this 
pathway represent the best therapeutic targets. Such insight 
would  reveal  which  drugs  should  be  preferentially  evalu­
ated  or  excluded  in  clinical  trials.  Therefore,  we  sought  to 
genetically and chemically deconstruct this pathway in NF1­
mutant  MPNSTs.  There  are  three  class  1A  catalytic  PI3K 
isoforms:  p110α,  p110β,  and  p110δ.  Although  p110α  is 
frequently mutated in human cancer, p110β has been shown 
to play an essential role in PTEN-mutant cancers, and p110δ 
is critical in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (18–20). To iden­
tify  which  catalytic  isoforms  are  essential  in  NF1­mutant 
nervous system malignancies, we first assessed the biologic 
effects of isoform­specific ablation in human MPNST cells 
derived from patients with NF1. Although all three isoforms 
were present in MPNSTs, genetic ablation of p110α, but not 
p110β or p110δ, dramatically impaired the proliferation of 

both  tumor  lines  (Fig.  1A).  Similarly,  NF1­mutant  gliob­
lastoma  (GBM)  cells  were  exclusively  sensitive  to  siRNA­
mediated  depletion  of  p110α,  but  not  p110β  or  p110δ, 
suggesting that p110α may play a more general role in NF1­
deficient  cancers  (Fig.  1A).  To  complement  these  findings, 
we used PI3K isoform–specific inhibitors: the p110α­specific 
inhibitor  A66­(S),  the  p110β­specific  inhibitor  AZD­6284, 
and the p110δ­specific inhibitor CAL­101, as well as GDC­
0941, a pan­PI3K inhibitor (21–24). The reported specifici­
ties  of  each  drug  are  outlined  in  Supplementary  Table  S1. 
In  human  MPNST  cell  lines,  the  p110α­specific  inhibitor 
A66­(S) and GDC­0941 potently inhibited the phosphoryla­
tion of AKT and S6; however, the p110β­ or p110δ­specific 
inhibitors,  AZD­6284  and  CAL­101,  respectively,  did  not 
suppress  the  phosphorylation  of  either  protein  (Fig.  1B). 
Accordingly,  A66­(S)  was  the  only  isoform­specific  inhibi­
tor that suppressed proliferation in these cells (P = 0.039 in 
90­8TLs and P = 0.0006 in S462s; Fig. 1C). Together, these 
observations  suggest  that  p110α  is  the  primary  catalytic 
subunit  responsible  for  proproliferative  PI3K  signaling  in 
NF1­mutant nervous system malignancies.

sensitive  complex  mTORC1,  which  phosphorylates  4E­BP1

and S6 kinase, and the relatively rapamycin­insensitive com­
plex  mTORC2,  which  phosphorylates  AKT  at  serine  473  
(25, 26). NF1­deficient MPNSTs have been shown to be sensi­
tive  to  rapamycin,  indicating  that  mTORC1  plays  a  role  in 
this tumor type; however, the contribution of mTORC2 activ­
ity, if any, to MPNST growth is unknown (13, 17). We geneti­
cally targeted essential component proteins of each complex 
to evaluate the relative contribution of these two complexes. 
RAPTOR is an essential component of mTORC1, but is not 
present in mTORC2, whereas RICTOR, a primary component 
protein of mTORC2, is not a member of the mTORC1 com­
plex (27, 28) As expected, siRNA­mediated loss of RAPTOR or 
mTOR suppressed S6 phosphorylation and led to impaired 
proliferation of MPNST cell lines (Fig. 1D). However, loss of 
RICTOR had no effect on MPNST proliferation, despite the 
effective  suppression  of  phosphorylation  of  the  mTORC2 
target AKT (Fig. 1D).

To further evaluate a role, or lack thereof, for AKT, tumors 
cells were treated with the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK­2206 
(29).  MK­2206  suppressed  the  phosphorylation  of  AKT  at 
S473  and  T308  and  effectively  inhibited  AKT  kinase  activ­
ity,  as  confirmed  by  the  loss  of  TSC2  phosphorylation  on 
T1462 (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1). However, unlike 

rapamycin,  MK­2206  had  no  effect  on  the  proliferation  of 
NF1­mutant MPNST cells (Fig. 1E). The mTOR kinase inhibi­
tor  Torin1  inhibits  both  the  mTORC1  and  mTORC2  com­
plexes. Notably, Torin1 has been reported to more effectively 
inhibit mTORC1, as compared with rapamycin, and in par­
ticular  more  potently  suppresses  4E­BP1  phosphorylation, 
as observed in these studies (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. 
S1).  Accordingly,  Torin1  potently  suppressed  the  prolifera­
tion  of  NF1-mutant  cells  and  did  so  better  than  rapamycin 
(P < 0.02). As noted, both MK­2206 and Torin1 equivalently 
and potently suppressed AKT phosphorylation and activity, 
although only Torin1 suppressed MPNST cell proliferation. 
Moreover,  MK­2206  did  not  enhance  the  antiproliferative 
effects  of  rapamycin  (Fig.  1F).  Taken  together,  these  results 
suggest  that  mTORC1  is  a  critical  effector  in  NF1­mutant 
cancers and that mTORC2 and AKT are dispensable in these 
tumor cells.

Selection of an Effective PI3K–mTOR  
Pathway Inhibitor

These  in vitro  studies  suggested  that  pan­PI3K  inhibitors, 
p110α­specific inhibitors, or mTORC1 inhibitors should sup­
press the growth of NF1­mutant MPNSTs. Therefore, we first

a genetically engineered mouse MPNST model. Like human 
MPNSTs, tumors from these animals harbor compound muta­
tions in Nf1 and Trp53 and develop with an average latency of 
5  months.  These  MPNSTs  are  highly  aggressive,  and  mice 
survive for an average of 10.7 days after tumors are detected, 
thus  recapitulating  the  aggressive  nature  of  human  tumors 
(30). As previously shown, rapamycin suppressed the growth 
of Nf1/Trp53-mutant MPNSTs (P < 0.0001; ref. 13); however, 
GDC­0941 did so significantly less well (P = 0.0021; Fig. 2A). 
Notably, the MTD of GDC­0941 (150 mg/kg) inhibited the 

phosphorylation  of  AKT,  S6,  and  4E­BP1  in  tumors  within 
1  hour;  however,  these  pathways  were  reactivated  within  
4  hours  after  treatment  (Fig.  2B).  In  contrast,  rapamycin 
suppressed  S6  and  4E­BP1  phosphorylation  for  at  least  18 
hours,  consistent  with  the  observed  enhanced  efficacy  and 
the demonstrated importance of mTORC1 in these tumors. 
It  should  be  noted  that  AKT  is  not  activated  by  relief  of 
feedback  mechanisms  in  this  model,  as  we  have  previously 
shown (Fig. 2B; ref. 13, 31). Several other PI3K–mTOR path­
way  inhibitors,  including  BEZ­235,  Torin2,  and  INK­128, 
were  evaluated  in  these  animals  (data  not  shown);  however,

we were unable to identify an inhibitor that exhibited better 
pharmacodynamics or growth inhibition than rapamycin at 
tolerable  doses  in  these  animals.  Therefore,  rapamycin  was 
selected for further studies.

Combined, Sustained Inhibition of mTORC1 and 
MEK Promotes MPNST Regression In Vivo

Although  mTORC1  is  a  critical  signaling  node  in  NF1-
mutant tumors, mTORC1 inhibition exerted only cytostatic 
effects on MPNSTs in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 1D and E and 
2A; ref. 13). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of rapamycin 
combined with a MEK inhibitor, which targets a second criti­
cal RAS­effector pathway. Tumor­bearing mice were treated 
with  vehicle,  the  MEK  inhibitor  PD­0325901,  rapamycin, 
or  the  combination  of  rapamycin  and  PD­0325901.  As  a 
monotherapy,  PD­0325901  slightly  attenuated  the  growth 
of MPNSTs, but did so less than rapamycin (Fig. 2C). How­
ever, combined PD­0325901 and rapamycin induced tumor 
regression in these mice (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, these obser­
vations differ from effects observed in benign NF1­deficient 
peripheral  nervous  system  tumors  and  myeloid  malignan­
cies,  where  MEK  seems  to  function  as  the  dominant  RAS­
effector pathway and MEK inhibitors exert cytotoxic effects 
alone,  suggesting  that  different  tumor  types  harboring  the 
same  initial  driving  genetic  lesion  may  rely  on  different 
downstream  signals  (32,  33).  Nevertheless,  upon  examin­
ing the pharmacodynamics of PD­0325901 at this dose, we 
found  that  ERK  phosphorylation  was  inhibited  for  only  4 
to 6 hours, whereas sustained inhibition could be achieved 
by  dosing  with  PD­0325901  twice  daily  (Fig.  2D).  As  such, 
we hypothesized that a revised dosing schedule might exert 
more  potent  therapeutic  effects.  Twice­daily  PD­0325901 
treatment  did  not  promote  tumor  regression  as  a  mono­
therapy;  however,  when  combined  with  rapamycin,  twice­
daily  PD­0325901  treatment  improved  the  therapeutic 
response  (Fig.  2E).  All  mice  treated  with  this  combination 
responded, and more than half of the tumors regressed 50% 
or more, with several shrinking 75% or more. Together, these 
observations  indicate  that  the  duration  of  both  MEK  and 
mTORC1  inhibition  is  a  critical  determinant  of  the  thera­
peutic response.

Identifying GLUT1 as a Component of the 
Therapeutic Signature That Is Suppressed  
before Tumor Regression

Pharmocodynamic markers in tumors are often not exam­
ined  during  clinical  trials,  and  when  they  are,  the  kinetics 
of suppression are difficult to evaluate. Therefore, if a treat­
ment  does  not  show  efficacy,  especially  in  cases  of  dose  de­
escalation,  it  is  often  unclear  whether  the  target  or  targets 
were sufficiently inhibited. Therefore, we sought to identify a 
molecular change that might serve as a functional biomarker 
of effective, combined inhibition of mTORC1 and MEK path­
ways.  The  transcriptional  profiles  of  tumors  from  animals 
treated with vehicle, rapamycin, PD­0325901 (twice daily), or 
the combination of rapamycin and PD­0325901 were evalu­
ated.  Importantly,  tissues  were  collected  after  14  hours  of 
treatment:  a  time  point  that  would  capture  transcriptional 
changes caused by sustained target inhibition but occurring 
before tumor regression. Using a gene expression class com­

parison, we identified a gene set that was exclusively regulated 
by combined rapamycin and PD­0325901 treatment (Fig. 3A). 
Interestingly,  Slc2a1,  which  encodes  a  glucose  transporter 
and is commonly referred to as Glut1, was identified as one of 
the  uniquely  suppressed  genes  in  rapamycin–PD­0325901–
treated  tumors  (Fig.  3A).  Effective  mTORC1  and  MEK  tar­
get  inhibition  in  tumor  tissue  was  verified  (Fig.  3B).  qPCR 
analysis  confirmed  that  Glut1  levels  were  reduced  64%  after 
only  14  hours  of  treatment  compared  with  vehicle­treated 
tumors and that neither rapamycin nor PD­0325901 exerted 
suppressive  effects  alone  (Fig.  3C).  A  dramatic  decrease  in 
GLUT1  protein  levels  was  further  confirmed  by  evaluating 
its expression in tumor biopsies taken before and 3 days after 
treatment (Fig. 3D). These findings differ from observations 
in VHL- and LKB1-mutant tumors, where GLUT1 mRNA and 
consequently  protein  expression  are  primarily  regulated  by 
mTOR  and  HIF1α,  and  its  expression  can  be  suppressed 
by  mTORC1  inhibitors  alone  (34,  35).  However,  in  these 
Nf1-mutant  MPNSTs,  suppression  of  both  mTORC1  and 
the MEK–ERK pathways is required. This finding resolves a 
long­standing  observation  that  rapamycin  is  not  sufficient 
to suppress the expression of GLUT1 or other HIF1α target 
genes in vitro or in vivo in this tumor type (13). Together, these 
results  demonstrate  that  GLUT1  is  suppressed  in  MPNSTs 
only  after  combined  mTORC1  and  MEK  inhibition,  which 
could  be  exploited  for  developing  an  imaging  biomarker  of 
combined target inhibition.

Only Combined, Effective Suppression of mTORC1 
and MEK Inhibits 18F-FDG Uptake

GLUT1 is a membrane­bound glucose transporter that is 
frequently  overexpressed  in  tumors,  in  part  because  altered 
tumor  metabolism  requires  increased  glucose  uptake  (36–
39).  This  metabolic  activity  can  be  measured  by  PET  scans 
designed to quantify 18F­FDG uptake (40). GLUT1 has been 
shown  to  regulate  18F­FDG  uptake  in  a  variety  of  tumor 
types (41, 42). MPNSTs are generally FDG–PET positive, and 
enhanced  18F­FDG  uptake  is  used  to  diagnose  a  conversion 
to malignancy, as MPNSTs often arise from benign precursor 
lesions (43). Because human MPNSTs exhibit a strong FDG–
PET signal, and because GLUT1 was specifically suppressed in 
tumors treated with combined rapamycin and PD­0325901, 
we  hypothesized  that  the  substantial  reduction  in  GLUT1 
mRNA  and  protein  might  inhibit  18F­FDG  uptake  in  these 
tumors. To evaluate this possibility, FDG–PET imaging was 
performed  on  tumor­bearing  mice.  As  expected,  MPNSTs 
were FDG–PET positive at baseline, mirroring the behavior of 
human MPNSTs (Fig. 4A). Mice were then treated with vehi­
cle, PD­0325901, rapamycin, or PD­0325901–rapamycin, and 
PET analysis was performed a second time, 40 hours after the 
baseline scan. This time point was selected because it repre­
sents a time before detectable regression occurs, to avoid any 
confounding change in the FDG–PET signal due to a reduc­
tion in tumor size. It should be noted that the initial (64%) 
decrease in Glut1 mRNA levels can be detected 14 hours after 
treatment;  however,  given  the  dramatic  decrease  in  GLUT1 
protein after 72 hours, this repression is sustained and per­
haps  enhanced.  Animals  treated  with  vehicle,  PD­0325901, 
or  rapamycin  did  not  have  a  significant  change  in  18F­FDG 
uptake  after  treatment  (Fig.  4A  and  B);  however,  animals

treated  with  both  PD­0325901  and  rapamycin  exhibited  a 
significant decrease in the highest standardized uptake value 
(SUVmax; P < 0.004; Fig. 4A and B). Importantly, although hex­
okinase and other GLUT genes can regulate glucose uptake in 
some settings (41, 44–46), rapamycin–PD­0325901 treatment 
did not affect the expression of any of these genes, suggest­
ing that GLUT1 may be the rate­limiting step for FDG–PET 
uptake in MPNSTs (Supplementary Table S2).

These  observations  suggested  that  FDG–PET 

imag­
ing  could  be  used  as  a  biomarker  of  effective  combined 
mTORC1–MEK  inhibition  in  NF1­mutant  tumors.  Such 
a  biomarker  would  be  invaluable  in  the  course  of  evaluat­
ing similar therapies in the clinic and in the course of dose 
de­escalation/escalation  studies.  This  biomarker  would  be 
particularly useful if the early changes in FDG–PET imaging 
were  predictive  of  a  later  change  in  tumor  size.  To  experi­
mentally  evaluate  this  possibility,  we  performed  a  dose  de­
escalation study in mice. Mice were treated with rapamycin 

in combination with 100%, 50%, or 25% of the PD­0325901 
dose.  As  expected,  this  produced  a  range  of  responses  in 
FDG–PET  uptake  at  40  hours  and  tumor  regression  after 
10  days  (Fig.  4C  and  D).  Importantly,  the  suppression  of 
FDG–PET  activity  at  40  hours,  as  measured  by  change  in 
SUVmax, correlated with the ultimate decrease in tumor size 
after  10  days  (Pearson  r  =  0.711;  P  =  0.03;  Fig.  4D  and  E). 
These  results  suggest  that  early  changes  in  the  FDG–PET 
signal  are  indicative  of  the  degree  of  target  inhibition  and 
correlate with eventual tumor regression in MPNSTs treated 
with combined mTORC1–MEK inhibitors.

Log2 fold of SUVmax

treated with vehicle, PD-0325901, rapamycin, or both (Rap–PD). PD-0325901 was dosed twice daily. Baseline scans are shown at left (pre-), and the right 
image shows the same view of the same animal 40 hours after treatment with the indicated compound (post-). Arrow, MPNST. Scale bar, relative 18F-FDG 
uptake, with low uptake in blue and highest uptake in white. B, the 18F-FDG uptake by tumors was quantified using SUVmax, and the log2 of the fold change 
of this number was calculated to indicate the change in 18F-FDG uptake 40 hours after treatment relative to baseline for each animal. The change in 
combination-treated animals (Rap–PD) is compared with monotherapy and vehicle-treated animals (controls). The y-axis indicates the log2 of the fold 
change in SUVmax relative to baseline. C, representative images of FDG–PET scans of animals treated with 100% PD-0324901–rapamycin, 50%PD-
0325901–rapamycin, or 25% PD-0325901–rapamycin. The left image (pre-) shows the baseline scan for each animal and the right (post-) shows the scan

must  be  inhibited.  Such  information  would  undoubtedly 
facilitate  the  selection  of  the  most  appropriate  drugs  for 
clinical studies. In this study, we used a genetic and chemi­
cal  approach  to  systematically  deconstruct  the  PI3K  signal­
ing  pathway  in  NF1­mutant  nervous  system  malignancies. 
Importantly, we found that mTORC1, which is regulated by 
p110α in these tumors, is the minimal, essential PI3K path­

way component, and that surprisingly AKT and mTORC2 are 
dispensable. However, although agents that inhibit mTORC1 
promote  cytostasis  in  human  tumor  cells  and  genetically 
engineered  models,  tumor  regression  requires  concomitant 
suppression of the MEK–ERK pathway.

Notably,  there  are  currently  no  effective  therapies  for  
MPNSTs. As such, these studies reveal a promising therapeutic

approach  as  well  as  a  mechanistic  framework  for  selecting 
the most appropriate agents for clinical trials. For example, 
because p110β does not seem to contribute to the therapeutic 
response in these tumors, perhaps p110α­specific, β­sparing 
PI3K  inhibitors  could  be  used  with  less  toxicity  (47).  Alter­
natively, because mTORC1 seems to be the key PI3K effector 
in these tumors, perhaps rapalogues, which exhibit excellent 
pharmacokinetic  properties,  may  be  suitable  for  combina­
tion therapies. The observation that AKT is not activated in 
these tumors by feedback inhibition, and that AKT inhibitors 
do  not  enhance  the  effects  of  rapamycin,  further  alleviates 
the  concern  that  AKT  suppression  may  be  required  in  this 
setting.  Nevertheless,  these  studies  suggest  that  successful 
agents must promote sustained inhibition of both ERK and 
mTORC1.  Importantly,  suppression  of  these  same  targets 
results in tumor regression in a mouse model of NF1­mutant 
melanoma,  underscoring  the  importance  of  these  pathways 
in  NF1­deficient  cancers  (4).  Nevertheless,  establishing  the 
sufficient  degree/length  of  inhibition  of  both  targets  that 
will be required to mediate an efficacious response in patients 
represents a formidable challenge.

Although  mouse  models  are  useful  for  identifying  criti­
cal  therapeutic  targets  in  genetically  defined  cancers,  the 
ultimate success of a therapy in humans depends on many 
factors. Certainly, species­specific differences in tumor com­
plexity may limit efficacy or restrict therapeutic responses to 
a subset of patients. However, perhaps an even more impor­
tant  consideration  relates  to  dosing.  One  of  the  primary 
obstacles  in  developing  combination  therapies,  especially 
when  targeting  two  major  signaling  pathways,  is  achieving 
efficacy while preventing toxicity. As such, even if the correct 
therapeutic targets have been identified, it may not be pos­
sible to sufficiently suppress these targets in humans. MEK 
inhibitors have been shown to exhibit toxicity in humans at 
high doses (48, 49). Therefore, in this study, we used a dose 
of  PD­0325901  that  is  comparable  with  the  tolerable  dose 
in  humans.  Similarly,  the  dose  of  rapamycin  was  selected 
based on a previous preclinical study that led to a successful 
human clinical trial in a number of tuberous sclerosis com­
plex–related  pathologies,  although  reported  trough  plasma 
levels were somewhat higher than what has been observed in 
humans (∼50 ng/mL vs. 3–20 ng/mL in humans; refs. 50–53). 
However,  our  preliminary  observations  suggest  that  lower 
doses and/or intermittent dosing of mTOR inhibitors/rapal­
ogues are also effective when combined with MEK inhibitors. 
Given the differences in toxicity observed between mice and 
humans, only clinical trials will reveal whether an effective, 
nontoxic dose can be achieved. As such, another important 
goal of this study was to develop a biomarker that could be 
used to guide dosing in the clinic.

Current  clinical  trial  strategies  involve  dosing  up  to  the 
MTD of one drug, and adding the second drug to the toler­
able dose when possible. However, it is not always clear how 
dose  escalation/de­escalation  affects  the  degree  or  kinetics 
of target inhibition or if dosing at the MTD is necessary. As 
such, we set out to identify a biomarker that would serve as 
an  early  downstream  readout  of  effective,  combined  inhi­
bition  of  MEK  and  TORC1.  Although  several  genes  were 
identified  in  these  tumors,  GLUT1  stood  out  as  an  impor­
tant  and  tractable  molecular  change.  Consistent  with  the 

documented role of GLUT1 in regulating glucose uptake, we 
found that 18F­FDG uptake, as measured by FDG–PET, was 
a  reliable  readout  of  effective,  combined  target  inhibition 
in vivo. Importantly, changes in GLUT1 expression and  18F­
FDG  uptake  occurred  before  tumor  regression,  supporting 
its role as a molecular marker of TORC1–MEK suppression 
rather  than  a  consequence  of  tumor  shrinkage.  Interest­
ingly,  neither  GLUT1  expression  nor  glucose  uptake  was 
suppressed  after  treatment  with  either  rapamycin  or  MEK 
inhibitors  alone.  This  observation  differs  from  findings  in 
a subset of other mTOR­driven tumor types, where HIF1α­
dependent  GLUT1  expression  is  decreased  after  treatment 
with  rapamycin,  as  is  18F­FDG  uptake  (34,  35).  We  have 
previously shown that neither GLUT1 nor HIF1α levels are 
altered  in  MPNSTs  when  treated  with  rapamycin,  marking 
an important distinction between NF1­deficient tumors and 
these other mTOR­driven tumors (13). Here, we provide an 
explanation for this difference, as simultaneous inhibition of 
both the mTORC1 and MEK is required to suppress GLUT1 
and  18F­FDG  uptake  in  MPNSTs.  It  will  be  interesting  to 
determine whether inhibition of both pathways is required 
to alter glucose uptake in other tumors, in particular other 
RAS­driven  tumors.  Certainly,  other  factors,  such  as  hex­
okinase activity or other members of the GLUT family, may 
contribute to glucose uptake in some cancers, and in these 
instances, 18F­ FDG uptake might not be an effective biomar­
ker.  However,  our  studies  suggest  that  FDG–PET  imaging 
represents  a  promising,  noninvasive  means  of  measuring 
combined  mTORC1–MEK  inhibition  in  vivo  in  these  NF1­
mutant tumors, which can be readily incorporated into clini­
cal trials. Such a tool should help identify the most effective 
drugs and facilitate dosing, and its utility may extend beyond 
NF1­mutant cancers.

Targets,	Therapies,	and	Biomarkers	for	NF1-Mutant	Tumors

RESEARCH ARTICLE

Cellular Proliferation Studies

Approximately 125,000 cells per well were seeded in 6­well plates. 
For siRNA experiments, cells were seeded 12 to 16 hours after trans­
fection.  Twenty­four  hours  after  plating,  day  0  counts  were  taken 
using  a  hemocytometer  and  trypan  blue  exclusion.  For  inhibitor 
experiments,  drug  treatments  were  started  at  this  time.  Inhibitors 
were changed once daily, except in PI3K isoform experiments, where 
drugs  were  replenished  twice  daily.  Final  cell  counts  were  taken  96 
hours after day 0 counts.

Drug Treatments and Dosing Schedule

Animal procedures were approved by the Center for Animal and 
Comparative  Medicine  in  Harvard  Medical  School  in  accordance 
with  the  NIH  Guide  for  the  Care  and  Use  of  Laboratory  Animals 
and the Animal Welfare Act. C56/BL6 NPcis mice have been previ­
ously described (30). Mice were treated daily with rapamycin via i.p. 
injections at 5 mg/kg, which were prepared as previously described 
(13). PD­0325901 was administered at 1.5 mg/kg once or twice daily  
(10 hours apart) by oral gavage. PD­0325901 was prepared as previously 
described (54). GDC­0941 was administered at 150 mg/kg once daily by 
oral gavage. GDC­0941 was prepared as previously described (55). Com­
pounds given in combination were administered sequentially.

Biopsy

Tumor biopsy was performed on mice before drug treatment using 
the  wedge  biopsy  technique  and  snap­frozen.  Drug  treatment  was 
started  8  hours  after  initial  biopsy.  The  posttreatment  biopsy  was 
performed 3 days after treatment began. The mouse was anesthetized 
by isoflurane inhalation and given a local block with lidocaine and 
marcaine while the tumor biopsy was collected.

Tumor Volume Measurements

Mice were started on a treatment when tumor size reached 200 to 
1,000  mm3.  Tumor  size  was  measured  every  2  to  3  days  by  Vernier 
calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula 
 L × W2 × 0.52. A mouse pathologist confirmed that all tumors in this 
study are MPNSTs.

18F-FDG–PET Imaging and Analysis

PET/CT  scans  were  performed  on  the  Bioscan  NanoPET/CT  at 
the  Longwood  Small  Animal  Imaging  Facility.  This  PET  scanner  is 
equipped with a dedicated isoflurane anesthesia system, temperature­
controlled platform, cardiac gating, and respiratory gating. PET scan­
ning was performed on anesthetized animals lying motionless on a 
table,  after  retro­orbital  i.v.  injection  of  0.1  to  10  mCi  of  18F­FDG 
PET  radioisotope,  while  being  imaged  with  a  coincidence  camera. 
The  mice  were  imaged  after  a  predetermined  “washout”  period 
(30–60  minutes).  Individual  mice  were  first  scanned  before  treat­
ment  and  then  40  hours  after  the  treatment  regimen  was  initiated 
(see  dosing  schedule  methods).  For  quantitative  analysis,  the  SUV  
normalized  to  body  weight  in  the  tumor  was  calculated  using  SUV = 
ACvoi  (kBq/mL)/[FDGdose  (MBq)/BW  (kg)],  where  ACvoi  is  the 
average activity concentration in the tumor volume (or the maximum 
value), FDGdose is the dose of 18F­FDG administered, and BW is the 
body weight. For evaluating tumors, the highest SUV in the tumor 
was taken as the SUVmax.

Microarray

RNA  isolated  from  MPNST  tumor  samples  from  NPcis  mice 
treated for 14 hours with vehicle, rapamycin, PD­0325901, or the com­
bination of rapamycin and PD­0325901. For all PD­0325901–treated 
samples,  PD­0325901  was  dosed  a  second  time  at  10  hours.  RNA 
was isolated with Trizol following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA 

clean­up was then performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (#74104). 
The  Partners  HealthCare  Center  for  Personalized  Genetic  Medicine 
core facility hybridized the RNA to the Affymetrics Mouse Gene 1.0 
STS. To determine genes differentially expressed in the combination 
treatment, a class comparison between the combination­treated sam­
ples  and  all  other  samples  was  performed.  Analysis  was  completed 
using  BRB­Array  tools  developed  by  Dr.  Richard  Simon  (National 
Cancer Institute, NIH, Rockville, MD) and the BRB­ArrayTools Devel­
opment team. Thresholds were set at P < 0.001. Microarray data can be 
accessed in the GEO database (accession number GSE57141).
