Abstract About one half of malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNST) have Neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1)
mutations. NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene essential for
negative regulation of RAS signaling. Survival for MPNST
patients is poor and we sought to identify an effective
combination therapy. Starting with the mTOR inhibitors
rapamycin and everolimus, we screened for synergy in 542
FDA approved compounds using MPNST cells with a
native NF1 loss in both alleles. We further analyzed the
cell cycle and signal transduction. In vivo growth effects of
the drug combination with local radiation therapy (RT)
were assessed in MPNST xenografts. The synergistic
combination of mTOR inhibitors with bortezomib yielded
a reduction in MPNST cell proliferation. The combination
of mTOR inhibitors and bortezomib also enhanced the anti-
proliferative effect of radiation in vitro. In vivo, the com-
bination of mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) and bortezomib

Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are
an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma and about 50 % of
MPNSTs arise in Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 patients (NF1).
NF1 patients have 8–13 % lifetime risk of developing a
MPNST. Despite aggressive treatment, MPNST has a high
rate of recurrence and distant metastases. The 5-year sur-
vival rate ranges from 39 to 60 % [1–3]. These tumors have
a poor clinical prognosis, despite efforts to ﬁnd better
targeted therapy [4].

Neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene
essential for negative regulation of RAS protein activity
and is the most frequently mutated gene in MPNSTs [5, 6].
Loss of NF1 up-regulates PI3K/Akt/Mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and sensitizes cells to mTOR
inhibitors [7]. Overexpression of mTOR downstream sig-
naling components are observed in MPNST human sam-
ples and are associated with poor prognosis in MPNST
patients [8, 9]. Preclinical data showed an anti-tumoral
effect of allosteric inhibitors of mTOR in MPSNT mouse
models. However, blocking mTOR signaling promoted a
cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effect [10].

Combinatorial

targeted therapy has been previously
tested in preclinical MPNST models. Johansson et al.
observed that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus combined
with doxorubicin did not reduce MPNST tumor growth
in vivo. Everolimus plus erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor,
slightly reduced growth when compared with single treat-
ment in a xenograft MPNST model [11]. Recently, the
combination of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and HSP90
inhibitors resulted in tumor regression in MPNST trans-
genic mice, through a mechanism that involved endoplas-
matic reticulum stress and subsequent cell death [12].
Preclinical data showed an antiproliferative effect with
HSP90 inhibition in other tumor types and several HSP90
inhibitors are in clinical trials [13, 14].

In this study, we sought to identify potential combina-
tion therapies and test their efﬁcacy in an MPNST pre-
clinical model. We focused on FDA approved drugs to
accelerate any possible translational to clinical trials. We
ﬁrst screened 542 inhibitors seeking synergy with rapa-
mycin or everolimus to reduce MPNST cell proliferation.
We then tested the drug combination with radiation in vitro
and in a preclinical xenograft MPNST model.

Materials and methods

Cell culture, transfection and ionizing radiation

Human NF1-associated MPNST cell
lines NF90.8 and
ST88-14 were provided by Dr Michael Tainsky (Wayne
University, Detroit, MI), T265-2C was obtained from Dr
Steven Porcelli (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
Bronx, NY), and sNF96.2 was purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA) [15, 16]. MPNST cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10 % fetal
bovine serum (BenchMarck, Gemini Bio-Products, West
Sacramento, CA) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (Invit-
rogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 °C in an
humidiﬁed 5 % CO2 atmosphere. MPNST cells were
transiently transfected with 10 nM of siRNA duplex
mTOR#13
(CCAAAGUCAAUGUGCAGGAUCUUCC
CA) or mTOR#19 (GCCAAGACACAGUAGCGAAUG
UCAGGG) (Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Non-targeting GFP siRNA
(IDT DNA Technologies) was used as control. Cells were
irradiated in a Caesium137 (2.24 Gy/min) radiation source
Gammacell 1000 (MDS Nordion, Ottawa, ON, Canada).
All compound were purchased from LC Laboratories (LC
Laboratories, Woburn, MA), with exception of dichloro-
acetic acid (Tocris, Ellisville, MO) and dissolved in
dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO) (Sigma).

Cell proliferation and drug synergism

MPNST cell proliferation was performed using the ﬂuo-
rescence cell-based alamarBlue assay (Invitrogen). Fluo-
rescence was read in Victor-3 automated plate reader
(Perkim-Elmer, Turku, Finland), with a 540-nm excitation/
590-nm emission ﬁlter. Half inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (Prism, La Jolla,
CA) as previously described [17]. Effects of drug combi-
nations were
calculated using CompuSyn Software
(ComboSyn, Paramus, NJ) [18].

Drug screening

Cell-based drug screening was assessed by using the
NINDS discovery library (National Institute of Neurolog-
ical Disorders and Stroke) and the Approved Oncology
Drug Set III library (National Cancer Institute) (Supple-
mentary Table 1)—in combination with rapamycin or ev-
erolimus, as previously described [19]. NF90.8 cells were
seeded (103 cells/well) in 96-well black ﬂat-bottom plates,
allowed to attach for 24 h,
individually treated with
libraries compounds (4 lM) and rapamycin or everolimus
at 25 % of IC50 (12.5 and 5 lM, respectively). Cell pro-
liferation was analyzed 72 h after drug exposure using al-
amarBlue assay (Invitrogen). As a secondary screening
dose response curves (with at least nine different concen-
trations) were generated for each drug and cell proliferation
was analyzed by alamarBlue assay. IC50 was calculated
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA) as
described above.

Proteasome activity

MPNST cells were seeded at 104 cells/well
in 96-well
plates in triplicate and treated with bortezomib. Chymo-
trypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome was determined
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Proteasome-
Glo, Promega). Luminescence was read in Victor-3 auto-
mated plate reader (Perkim-Elmer).

Cell cycle analysis

Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described
[20]. MPNST cells (5 9 105) were subjected to radiation,
seeded in triplicate, and treated with everolimus and bort-
ezomib. After 48 h DNA was stained with propidium
iodide (20 lg/mL) (Sigma) and measured in ﬂow cytom-
eter BD Calibur (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). Data were
analyzed in BD CellQuest Pro software (BD Bioscience);
pulse width and pulse area were used to exclude doublets.

Western blot

Total protein lysates were extracted using RIPA buffer
(Sigma) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL) and protein
concentration was measured using the BCA protein kit
assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Proteins were separated by
4–12 % SDS-PAGE and blotted in a PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) as previously described [21]. The
following primary antibodies were used: mTOR (1:1,000),
cleaved PARP (Asp214) (1:1,000), PARP (1:1,000), S6
(1:1,000), pS6 (S240/244) (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling, Dan-
vers, MA), GAPDH (1:1,000) (FL-335), BCL-xL (1:1,000)
(S-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), BAX
(1:1,000) (06-499) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), and Actin
(1:1,000) (Sigma). The antigen–antibody complexes were
visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody (Invitrogen) and an enhanced chemilu-
minescence system (Thermo).

in a single dose (3-mm 9 3-mm beam) 4 mm below the
mouse skin. The ﬁrst dose of everolimus and bortezomib
were administrated 5 h after RT. Dry powder compounds
were dissolved in 1 % DMSO and 0.9 % sterile saline and
stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Tumor volume was
determined by caliper measurements once or twice a
week according to the following formula:
length 9
width2 9 0.5.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (Prism). The data were expressed as mean ± SD.
Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey tests was used for
multiple comparisons. P \ 0.05 was considered as statis-
tically signiﬁcant.

Results

Immunohistochemistry

Screening of 542 approved compounds with mTOR
inhibitors identiﬁes anti-proliferative combinations

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections from blocks of
xenograft MPNSTs. Immuno detection of cleaved caspase-
3 (1:400) and phospho-70S6K (thr389) (p70S6K) (1:100)
(Cell Signaling) expression was performed by an indirect
3-stage immunoenzymatic method as previously described
[17].

Xenograft MPNST and radiation therapy in vivo

tumor

(n = 5);

intraperitoneally 2 days a week)

Animal studies were approved by Johns Hopkins Animal
Care and Use Committee. Female athymic nude mice
(5–6 weeks) purchased from the National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, MD) were kept in a pathogen-controlled envi-
ronment with access to food and water ad libitum. For
in vivo experiments,
fragments (approximately
2 mm2) were implanted s.c. into the right ﬂank of the mice.
Animals were randomized in (a) control (n = 4); (b) ever-
olimus (1.5 mg/kg, orally 5 days a week)?bortezomib
(1.3 mg/m2,
(n = 4);
(c) radiation therapy (RT) (n = 5); (d) RT?everolimus
(e) RT?bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2)
(1.5 mg/kg)
(n = 5);
(1.5 mg/kg)?bortezomib
(1.3 mg/m2) (n = 5). Ten days after tumor implantation
local radiotherapy was performed by using the Small
Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP), which
mimics the isocentric external-beam used to deliver image-
guided radiotherapy in patients [22]. In brief, a 2.3 mm
CT-Spot (Beekley Medical, Bristol, CT) was used to locate
the tumor in the microcomputer tomography (CT) system.
Next, the tumor was locally subjected to 10 Gy of radiation

(f) RT?everolimus

and

everolimus mTOR inhibitors

We ﬁrst determined the effect of mTOR signaling inhibi-
tors as a single agent. Dose-dependent growth inhibition
was observed in MPNST cells treated with either rapa-
mycin or everolimus (Fig. 1a). As a single agent mTOR
inhibitors showed a very broad range of IC50 values in
tumor cell lines without an apparent relation to tumor
histotype [23–26]. Figure 1b shows the IC50 values in
MPNST cells harboring inactivating NF1 mutations. Rap-
amycin
strongly
decreased pS6 protein expression in NF 90.8 and T265-2C
cells (Fig. 1c). We then tested the combination of mTOR
inhibitors with 542 compounds in NF90.8 cells, seeking
potential candidates for drug combination (Fig. 1d). We
selected 10 compounds for further study, based on their
ability to decrease cell proliferation at 4 lM in combina-
tion with mTOR inhibitors at 25 % of IC50 in additional
cells, sNF96.2 and T265-2C (Supplementary Table 1).
When optimizing across a range of doses, the calculated
IC50 values for toremifen, riluzole and bortezomib were
reduced in combination with mTOR inhibitors in human
MPNST cells (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 2).

Combinations of mTOR inhibitors and bortezomib
decreased human MPNST cells proliferation

We identiﬁed bortezomib as a potential compound against
MPNST cell proliferation in combination with mTOR
inhibitors. The dose response curve of bortezomib in com-
bination with different concentrations of mTOR inhibitors
showed a leftward shift in the cell viability curve, indicating

drug combination exposure. c Synergistic activity of mTOR inhibitors
(25, 50 or 75 % of IC50) and bortezomib (1, 10 and 100 nM) in
NF90.8 cells was calculated using the method of Chou and Talalay.

Fig. 3 The drug combination with radiation further decreases MPNST
cell proliferation. a MPNST cells were subjected to radiation (4 Gy)
Gammacell 1,000 (2.24 Gy/min; radiation source: Caesium137), treated
with bortezomib (5 nM) plus rapamycin at 50 % of IC50 (25 lM for
NF90.8; 21 lM for T265-2C cells and 27 lM for sNF96.2) or

Table 3). The synergistic combination was veriﬁed by using
the Chou–Talalay method for drug combination. Although
bortezomib at low concentration (1nM) showed moderate
synergism or antagonism, higher concentration of bortezo-
mib with a range of concentration of mTOR inhibitors
yielded very strong synergism in MPNST cells (Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Table 4). Bortezomib as a single agent
reduced chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome
MPNST cells (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Synergistic combination of mTOR inhibitors
and bortezomib radiosensitizes MPNST cells

Since mTOR inhibition radio-sensitizes soft tumor sarcoma
and the currently treatment of MPNST involves RT [4, 27],
we reasoned that mTOR inhibition and bortezomib treat-
ment might enhance the effects of radiation on MPNST
cells. A reduction in cell viability after radiation was
observed in a dose-dependent manner in all MPNST cells
tested (Supplementary Fig. 2). When testing the combina-
tion of radiation (12 Gy) with inhibition of mTOR by drugs
or siRNA mediated gene silencing, we observed a reduc-
tion in MPNST cell proliferation (Supplementary Figs. 4,
5). Therefore, we examined the combination of mTOR
inhibitors with bortezomib plus radiation in MPNST cells.
We tested a lower radiation dose (4 Gy) to determine if we
could observe synergism between drugs and radiation in a
low dose. The triple treatment was the most effective
combination to reduce MPNST cell proliferation (Fig. 3).
To assess whether this growth inhibition induced by
drug combination and radiation was associated with cell
cycle modulation, we analyzed the cell cycle distribution
by ﬂow cytometry. As expected, everolimus as a single
agent induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The combination of
everolimus and bortezomib plus radiation shows a G2/M
arrest and increased SubG1 fraction in MPNST cells
(Fig. 4a). To provide further evidence that the therapy
combination modulates apoptosis, we performed a protein
expression analysis of apoptosis regulators and cleaved-
PARP. BCL-xL expression decreased and BAX protein
expression slightly increased in cells treated with the
combination of everolimus, bortezomib and radiation in
NF90.8 cells. In addition, Western blot analysis showed an
increased in cleaved-PARP after radiation treatment
in
NF90.8 cells (Fig. 4b).

The combination of mTOR inhibition, bortezomib,
and radiation decreases MPNST growth in vivo

Encouraged by our in vitro data, we tested if the drug
combination with radiation could reduce growth of ﬂank

MPNST xenografts. A preliminary toxicity test was per-
formed to test if drug combination induces a systemic
toxicity. Animals treated with everolimus (1.5 mg/kg) in
combination with different concentrations of bortezomib
(0.65; 0.95; and 1.3 mg/m2) did not show weight
loss
(Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the combination of
everolimus and bortezomib did not induced obvious sys-
temic toxicity. Therefore, we implanted NF90.8 cells
subcutaneously nude mice and treated with radiotherapy
and/or drugs. In order to mimic the human doses, the drugs
administered in mice were similar to the FDA approved
human doses according with body surface mass for bort-
ezomib and body mass for everolimus [28]. In this exper-
iment
the combination of everolimus and bortezomib
decreased the tumor volume in 38 % when compared with
control group, a similar effect was observed in RT mice
with a reduction in tumor volume in 43 % when compared
with control group. RT combined with everolimus or
bortezomib decreased the tumor volume in 63 and 51 %,
respectively, when compared with control group. The mice

treated with RT?everolimus?bortezomib had the lower
mean tumor volume, decreasing 72 % when compared with
control group (Fig. 5a, b). We conﬁrmed the mTOR sig-
naling inhibition in xenograft MPNST model by the
immunostaining of phospho-P70S6K (p-P70S6K) expres-
sion. The groups treated with the everolimus slightly
reduced p-P70S6K expression. In addition, cleaved cas-
pase-3 was increased in all groups subjected to radiation,
suggesting that RT predominantly induces apoptosis in
xenograft MPNST (Fig. 5c).

Discussion

The pathological molecular effects that occur after NF1
loss, such as increased mTOR signaling, provide possible
opportunities for treating NF1-associated tumors such as
MPNSTs [10, 29]. However, a combination approach
should be considered during the early stages of therapeutic
strategy design to help combat the resistance that quickly

develops to single agent targeted therapy. This preclinical
investigation of combination therapy for MPNST has as its
foundation mTOR inhibition. Our drug screen with mTOR
inhibitors identiﬁed synergistic compounds that decrease
cell proliferation. We further characterized a triple treat-
ment in vitro and in vivo by adding radiation to mTOR
inhibitors and the synergistic bortezomib. This combina-
tion decreased, but unfortunately did not halt, growth of
MPNST ﬂank xenografts.

Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling is observed in
several types of cancer and currently several drugs target-
ing mTOR signaling are in clinical tests [30]. mTOR sig-
naling plays a central role in MPNST and it is a reasonable
target for this tumor type. However, cancer cells acquire
drug resistance against single agent therapy [31]. There-
fore, drug combination is often a necessary strategy to
overcome drug resistance [30, 32]. In addition, drugs with
strong synergy might theoretically improve efﬁcacy and
decrease normal cell toxicity by reducing required drug
concentrations [33].

The combination of an mTOR inhibitor and bortezomib
shows synergistic activity in non-solid tumors cells (mantle
lymphoma and B-acute lymphocytic leukemia) and in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [24, 26, 36]. In addition, the
combination of temsirolimus, an analogue of rapamycin,
with bortezomib in relapsed and refractory multiple mye-
loma patients showed clinical beneﬁt and manageable
adverse effects [37]. Although mTOR inhibitors with
bortezomib showed synergy in different
types,
additional investigation is needed.

The addition of radiation in our combination therapy
helped reduce cell growth. Down-regulation of BCL-xL
and a slight increased in BAX expression was observed

xL is overexpressed in human MPNST samples and NF1
deﬁciency upregulates BCL-xL in vitro. Furthermore,
BCL-xL pharmacological
inhibition decreased MPNST
cell growth in combination with doxorubicin [38].
Therefore, modulating levels of BCL-xL directly, or by
targeting upstream regulators, could be an effective
inducer of apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis was
conﬁrmed by the increase of cleaved caspase-3 in vivo,

In summary, our preclinical study yielded some impor-
tant insights. First, cell-based screening assay for identiﬁ-
cation of approved compounds that cooperates to decrease
cell proliferation is a potentially valuable tool that could
accelerate the translational of a therapy to the clinic. Sec-
ond, using this approach we identiﬁed possible drug com-
bination candidates
for MPNST treatment. Finally,
pharmacologic and side effects for these drugs are known
in human, supporting faster translation to the clinic. These
preclinical data support a combination therapy, that might
include some or all of the modalities tested here, for pos-
sible clinical trials in MPNST patients.
