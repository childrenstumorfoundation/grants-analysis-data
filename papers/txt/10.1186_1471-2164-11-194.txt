murine NF1-haploinsufficiency

Abstract

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common monogenic tumor-predisposition disorder that arises
secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Haploinsufficiency of NF1 fosters a permissive
tumorigenic environment through changes in signalling between cells, however the intracellular mechanisms for
this tumor-promoting effect are less clear. Most primary human NF1+/- cells are a challenge to obtain, however
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been collected from large NF1 kindreds. We hypothesized that the genetic
effects of NF1-haploinsufficiency may be discerned by comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiling in
somatic, non-tumor cells (LCLs) from NF1-affected and -unaffected individuals. As a cross-species filter for
heterogeneity, we compared the results from two human kindreds to whole-genome transcriptional profiling in
spleen-derived B lymphocytes from age- and gender-matched Nf1+/- and wild-type mice, and used gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA), Onto-Express, Pathway-Express and MetaCore tools to identify genes perturbed in NF1-
haploinsufficiency.
Results: We observed moderate expression of NF1 in human LCLs and of Nf1 in CD19+ mouse B lymphocytes.
Using the t test to evaluate individual transcripts, we observed modest expression differences in the transcriptome
in NF1-haploinsufficient LCLs and Nf1-haploinsuffiicient mouse B lymphocytes. However, GSEA, Onto-Express,
Pathway-Express and MetaCore analyses identified genes that control cell cycle, DNA replication and repair,
transcription and translation, and immune response as the most perturbed in NF1-haploinsufficient conditions in
both human and mouse.
Conclusions: Haploinsufficiency arises when loss of one allele of a gene is sufficient to give rise to disease.
Haploinsufficiency has traditionally been viewed as a passive state. Our observations of perturbed, up-regulated cell
cycle and DNA repair pathways may functionally contribute to NF1-haploinsufficiency as an “active state” that
ultimately promotes the loss of the wild-type allele.

Background
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common mono-
genic tumor-predisposition disorder with an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance that arises secondary to
haploinsufficiency of the tumor suppressor gene NF1.
Haploinsufficiency is often defined as a gene-dosage
effect in which loss of one allele of a gene results in dis-
ease. In the Knudson “two-hit” model [1], haploinsuffi-
ciency of a tumor-suppressor gene (NF1 included)
increases the probability of cancer development, but

does not functionally contribute to it [2]. This view of
haploinsufficiency as a passive state is coming under
revision [3]. In mice haploinsufficiency of NF1 fosters a
permissive tumorigenic environment for the develop-
ment of neurofibromas [4,5], optic nerve gliomas [6]
and blood vessels [7], suggesting a role for haploinsuffi-
ciency itself in tumor formation. The intracellular
changes that give rise to this tumor-promoting effect of
NF1-haploinsufficiency are unclear.

In this paper, we used a novel approach to investigate
the genetic consequences of NF1-haploinsufficiency in
humans. We hypothesized that the genetic effects of
NF1-haploinsufficiency may be discerned by comparison

of genome-wide transcriptional profiling in somatic,
non-tumor cells from NF1-affected and -unaffected indi-
viduals. Studies of haploinsufficiency in humans are
easily confounded by inter-individual variation [3] due
to germline expression differences and mutation hetero-
geneity. To reduce variation in germline expression, we
used a family-based approach and performed whole-gen-
ome transcriptional profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs) on gender- and age- matched affected and unaf-
fected (but biologically related) individuals from two
large NF1 pedigrees. Neurofibromin (the protein pro-
duct of NF1) is expressed and is functionally important
in B lymphocytes (the cells transformed by Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) into LCLs) [8]. The use of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells or LCLs for disease expression profil-
ing has precedents in oncologic [9], neurologic [10,11],
and monogenic [12,13] disorders, as well as in NF1 itself
[14]. To reduce genetic heterogeneity, we studied
affected individuals within a pedigree who share the
same mutation in NF1. To further control for heteroge-
neity, we compared the results from the two human
pedigrees to whole-genome transcriptional profiling in

spleen-derived B lymphocytes from age- and gender-
matched Nf1+/- [15] and wild-type mice as a cross-species
filter for changes specific to NF1-haploinsufficiency.
We used a variety of bioinformatic and molecular
methods to identify and validate genes perturbed in
NF1-haploinsufficiency.

Results
NF1 mutations in Coriell pedigree 2176 and ECACC
pedigree P0117
To minimize the effects of genetic background and elimi-
nate NF1 mutation heterogeneity, we investigated the
consequences of NF1 haploinsufficiency on expression
within age- and gender-matched groups from two pedi-
grees (Table 1). All individuals deemed “NF1-affected” in
Coriell pedigree 2176 harbored a 4-bp deletion in exon
22, which is predicted to result in a premature stop
codon. All individuals deemed “NF1-affected” from
ECACC family P0117 harbored a 9-bp deletion in intron
9, which is predicted to disrupt the acceptor splice site
of exon 10a, leading to exon skipping during mRNA
splicing. All individuals deemed “NF1-unaffected” in both

EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from two kindreds, Coriell-18 and ECACC-6, were obtained from Coriell and ECACC cell repositories, respectively.
NF1-affected members of Coriell-18 set have a 4 bp deletion (5’-TTTG-3’) in exon 22 of NF1, which is predicted to result in a premature stop codon. NF1-affected
members of ECACC-6 set have a 9 bp deletion (5’-TTTTCTCTA-3’) in intron 9 of NF1, which is predicted to disrupt the acceptor splice site of exon 10a, leading to
exon skipping during mRNA splicing. Both mutations are predicted to be pathogenic. Mutations are described with nucleotide 1 being the A of the ATG
translation initiation codon in the sequence NM_000267. Coriell and ECACC Family and Sample IDs for the cell lines are indicated in respective columns.
Information for NF1-affected individuals is distinguished in boldface. N.A. - data not available; N.D. - not detected.

the Coriell and ECACC kindreds did not harbor their
pedigree-specific NF1 mutation.

Evaluation of Nf1+/- mice
The six adult Nf1+/- heterozygous mice were confirmed
to bear the deletion of exon 31 and a part of intron 30
in Nf1 (data not shown). We detected no significant dif-
ferences in organ weights between heterozygote and
wild-type animals (all 8 months old), with the exception
of spleen weight (wild-type mice: 72 mg vs. Nf1+/-
mice:106 mg; P < 0.00096), which was larger in the
Nf1+/-mice. There was no histologic evidence of a
neoplastic process in any of the tissues examined in the
animals. The complete blood count of both the wild-
type and Nf1+/- mice was normal.

NF1 is moderately expressed in human LCLs and CD19+
mouse B lymphocytes
In NF1-affected LCLs, we observed a mean decrease of
40% (Coriell-18) and 17% (ECACC-6) of NF1 mRNA
abundance compared to NF1-unaffected LCLs from the
same pedigree (Figure 1). In the Coriell-18 group, the
difference in NF1 expression was statistically significant.
In the ECACC-6 group, there was a non-significant
decrease in NF1 expression (Figure 1A). Nevertheless,
there was a dramatic decrease in neurofibromin expres-
sion detected by western blotting between selected
affected and unaffected individuals in both the Coriell
and ECACC pedigrees (Figures 1B and 1C). Since
mouse B lymphocytes cannot be immortalized with viral
transfection, we used freshly isolated murine spleen B
lymphocytes. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis showed greater than 90% purity of CD19+ cells
from all animals (data not shown). As in human LCLs,
Nf1 is moderately expressed in mouse lymphocytes (Fig-
ure 2A) but is not significantly different between Nf1+/-
and wild-type animals (Figure 2B), as previously
reported [15]. We were unable to perform western blot-
ting on murine spleen CD19+ B lymphocytes due to the
limited amount of material available, nevertheless, neu-
rofibromin abundance in other tissues in the Nf1+/-
mice was decreased (data not shown).

NF1-haploinsufficiency in LCLs and mouse B lymphocytes
results in modest differences in individual transcript
abundance between NF1-affected and -unaffected
Permuted t test and intersection analysis
In the human and mouse expression datasets, permuted t
test revealed few statistically significant genes after cor-
rection for multiple testing (Table 2). There were no
transcripts with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than
0.25 in common among the three groups. Thus, we per-
formed an intersection analysis of the top ~5% of tran-
scripts from the three groups (Figure 3; Additional file 1).

The overlap of ECACC-6 with Nf1-Mouse-12 was highly
significant (P = 7.5 × 10-4) as well as the overlap between
two human groups (P = 1.2 × 10-3). Coriell-18 did not
significantly overlap with Nf1-Mouse-12 (P = 0.42). The
three-way overlap between the groups produced a single
gene and was not significant (P = 0.71).
Cross-platform validation of microarray results
We analyzed the Coriell-18 group on both the Illumina
single-color and the spotted oligonucleotide (two-color)
arrays. Of the top 5% of differentially expressed genes,
there were 114 common genes on both lists (Additional
file 2); the overlap is highly statistically significant (P =
8.8 × 10-6) (Figure 4A). Moreover, for those 114 tran-
scripts, we observed 100% concordance between the two
platforms in direction of expression (over or under).
The degree of change (fold difference) for the transcripts
was close in both platforms as well (Figure 4B).
Quantitative PCR validation of microarray results
The validation set for quantitative PCR (qPCR) included
transcripts which were either statistically significant by t
test or in an intersection analysis (Table 3). Of twelve t
test-significant transcripts (seven human and five
mouse), nine transcripts (five human and four mouse), or
75%, were confirmed by qPCR (nominal P < 0.05). The
validated transcripts included human CNKSR3, IFI6,
EGLN3, MGST3, POMC and mouse Cxcr3, Gsg2, Igtp,
and Rnf43. Of nine transcripts identified by intersection
analysis, 33% were validated by qPCR (three human tran-
scripts only:C11orf75, RAB31, and DUSP4). RAB31 was
the only transcript confirmed by qPCR in both human
groups. DUSP4, found in three-way overlap, was vali-
dated by qPCR in the Coriell-18 group only. Differential
expression as determined by qPCR was modest and ran-
ged from 0.39 for CNKSR3 in Coriell-18 to 2.57 for
RAB31 in ECACC-6. We observed near 100% concor-
dance between microarray and qPCR approaches in
direction of gene expression (over or under). The only
exceptions were two genes in ECACC-6: CHURC1 was
over-expressed by microarray, but under-expressed by
qPCR, and POMC was under-expressed by microarray,
and over-expressed by qPCR (Additional file 3). Differen-
tial expression of transcripts tended to be more pro-
nounced in qPCR than microarrays (Additional file 3).

Figure 5). We found that >75% of up-regulated LEA
genes in the human ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups
(cell cycle/mitosis/cytokinesis and DNA repair/replica-
tion/recombination categories) shared similar ontology
(Additional file 5). Three of the four largest ontological
categories
from the analysis of Coriell-18 LEA

(transcription/RNA processing, DNA repair/replication/
recombination and cell proliferation) were shared with
the ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups, albeit the dis-
tribution of genes among the ontological categories was
different. In the Coriell-18 up-regulated LEA, the largest
category (translation/protein biosynthesis/ribosome bio-
genesis) was unique to that group.

Ontological analysis of down-regulated genes in Coriell-
18 and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups revealed four major com-
mon categories (excluding “unknown”):
immune/
defense/antiviral/inflammatory response, signal trans-
duction, metabolic process and apoptosis (Figure 5;
Additional file 5). “Immune/defense/antiviral/inflamma-
tory response” was the largest ontological category in
the two groups. These genes accounted for more than a
third and almost a quarter of the genes in the Coriell-18
and the mouse LEA lists, respectively. Note that GSEA
of down-regulated transcripts in ECACC-6 yielded only

one significant gene set, and therefore LEA of down-
regulated transcripts in ECACC-6 could not performed.
When examined individually, the majority of LEA genes
(whether up- or down-regulated) are only modestly dif-
ferentially expressed in affecteds as compared to unaf-
fecteds, or in Nf1+/- compared to wild-type mice.

t tests were performed for two human and the mouse sample sets. In each
list, genes were ranked according to their False Discovery Rate (FDR).

[16,17], Pathway-Express [18,19] and MetaCore software
(Additional files 6, 7, 8, 9). Onto-Express analysis identi-
fied the ontological category “transcription” (FDR =
1.86 × 10-4) as the most significantly perturbed biologi-
cal process among up-regulated transcripts in the
Coriell-18 kindred (Additional file 6). Among down-

“response to virus,” and ‘innate immune response” as
highly statistically significant ontological categories
(Additional file 6). Among up-regulated transcripts in
the Nf1-Mouse-12 set, Onto-Express identified “mitosis,”
“cell cycle,” “cell division” and “DNA replication” as
highly statistically significant perturbed ontological cate-
gories (Additional file 6). There were no statistically sig-
nificant down-regulated biological processes in the
ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 sets as determined by
Onto-Express analysis. The Onto-Express method iden-
tified four ontological categories with modest FDR
among genes up-regulated in ECACC-6 (Additional file
6). In summary, with the exception of ontological
categories up-regulated in ECACC-6, there was good
overlap in the results from the GSEA and Onto-Express
methods (Figure 5, Additional file 5 and Additional file 6)
Next, we used Pathway-Express [18,19] to determine
whether differentially expressed genes in the Coriell-18,
ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 sample sets are enriched
with genes from known cellular pathways and whether
these pathways are significantly perturbed by NF1-hap-
loinsufficiency. Pathway-Express is a systems biology
approach that considers the magnitude of expression
change, gene type, position and interactions in known
pathways [18]. As with Onto-Express, the Pathway-
Express analysis agrees reasonably well with the GSEA
analysis for the Coriell-18 and the Nf1-Mouse-12 sample
sets. In these two sample sets, both Pathway-Express and
GSEA identified immune system function and cell cycle,
DNA replication and DNA repair, as significantly

perturbed by NF1-haploinsufficiency (Additional file 7,
Figure 5, Additional file 5). In contrast, there was no over-
lap in the analysis of ECACC-6 by GSEA and Pathway-
Express. Examination of the pathways significantly per-
turbed in the three sets (as per Pathway-Express analysis)
reveals that immune system signalling networks were the
most abundant among the sets (Additional file 7).

Lastly, we used ontological categories and pathway
analyses of the MetaCore “Biological Processes” and
“Pathway Maps” as a third independent validation of
our results from GSEA. First, the “Biological Processes”
analysis (Additional file 8) yielded many ontological
categories previously identified using the GSEA and
Onto-Express methods. Among the top ten ontological
categories for genes up-regulated in the Coriell-18 set
are included “gene expression,” “chromatin remodeling,”
“transcription,” and “regulation of DNA damage
response signal transduction by p53 class mediator.”

Similarly, the top ten ontological categories for genes
up-regulated in the Nf1-Mouse-12 set all pertain to cell
cycle and mitosis processes. As with the Onto-Express
and Pathway-Express methods, there was more limited
overlap in ontological categories for genes up-regulated
in the ECACC-6 set. Second, the “Pathway Maps”
method (Additional file 9) uses the GeneGo proprietary
database to identify statistically significant pathways per-
turbed in a list of differentially expressed genes. This
approach identified the “cell cycle_chromosome conden-
sation in prometaphase” as the top perturbed pathway
in the up-regulated Nf1-Mouse-12 set. This and other
cell cycle and immune pathways are akin to those found
using the Pathway-Express (Additional file 7) approach
in the Nf1-Mouse-12 set. The pathways identified by
the “Pathway Maps” method for the Coriell-18 and
ECACC-6 sets did not correlate well with those found
by Pathway-Express.

Figure 4 Comparison of expression profiles generated by Illumina_Human_WG_v2 and spotted oligonucleotide microarrays. A) Coriell-
18 samples were analyzed in parallel on two different types of microarrays: Illumina_Human_WG_v2 ("Illumina”) and spotted oligonucleotide
microarrays manufactured in the NHGRI core facility ("NHGRI”). Genes were ranked according to nominal P values of the t tests, and top ~5% of
genes in each list were chosen for the intersection analysis; B) Bar plot represents fold difference of expression values (NF1-affecteds vs. NF1-
unaffecteds) for the overlapping genes. Each overlapping transcript is represented by a pair of bars. Blue bars denote transcripts on Illumina
platform; orange bars denote transcripts on the NHGRI platform. Numbers on X-axis represent transcripts in the overlap (114 total).

The Nf1-Mouse-12 set produced the most consistent
results across all analyses (GSEA, Onto-Express, Path-
way-Express and MetaCore). This may be due to the
uniform genetic background shared by the animals in
the set. We found less consistent results across all ana-
lyses with the ECACC-6 set, however this could be due
to its small size and diminished statistical power.

Discussion and Conclusions
The clinical, cellular and cell-signalling consequences of
NF1-haploinsufficiency are well known [20-22]. Geno-
mic changes are less well characterized. We present, to
our knowledge, the first genome-wide study of the con-
sequences of NF1-haploinsufficiency on germline (i.e.
non-tumor) gene expression in humans. Consistent with

Gene sets with FDR < 0.05 were considered significant. “Up-regulated gene

Nf1+/- mice as compared to NF1-unaffecteds or wild-type mice.

the known dysregulation of RAS in NF1, we found evi-
dence of up-regulation of cell cycle, mitosis, cytokinesis
and RNA processing and transcription ontologic cate-
gories in LCLs. For the first time, we also found up-reg-
ulation of DNA repair, replication and recombination
ontologic categories, presumably secondary to general-
ized cell cycle activation. Activation and subsequent
deregulation of these critical pathways is a plausible
cause for the permissive tumorigenic environment that
is the hallmark of NF1-haploinsufficiency.

We hypothesized that in the tightly regulated somatic
cell haploinsufficient changes, even of a critical gene like
NF1, will be modest but detectable by microarray. Stu-
dies of the genome-wide consequences of tumor sup-
pressor haploinsufficiency ideally require normal tissue,
since tumor cell
lines often feature copy-number
changes [23]. Other studies investigating the genomic
consequences of tumor suppressor inactivation have
engineered near-nullizygosity (i.e. not haploinsufficiency)
using RNA interference technology [24]. We elected to
use LCLs from two banked kindreds for three reasons.
First, within a family we were able to control for NF1
mutation heterogeneity. Second, neurofibromin is
expressed and is functionally important in RAS regula-
tion in B lymphocytes [25,26] in mouse models of NF1.
Consistent with a functional role for neurofibromin in
control of murine lymphocyte growth regulation in
spleen [26], we observed a statistically significant differ-
ence in spleen weights between wild-type and Nf1+/-
animals. Importantly, we detected no evidence by histol-
ogy or blood count of a leukemic or pre-leukemic disor-
der. Third, the study of the genetics of gene expression
commonly uses LCLs, whose global gene expression pat-
terns do not appear to be significantly disrupted by EBV
transformation [27]. We show that NF1 is expressed at
modest levels in normal LCLs (Figure 1) and fluctuates
following serum deprivation (Additional file 10), sug-
gesting that EBV transformation of B lymphocytes did
serum-dependent NF1
not abrogate baseline or
expression.

We found a statistically significant difference in NF1
expression level between affected and unaffected indivi-
duals in the Coriell 2176 pedigree (Figure 1). Affected
individuals from the kindred harbor an NF1 mutation
predicted to result in a premature stop codon, which
presumably results in nonsense-mediated decay. We
observed no statistically significant difference in NF1
expression level in the ECACC P0117 pedigree, whose
affected individuals harbor an NF1 mutation predicted
to result in exon 10a skipping (Figure 1). Presumably,
this mutation does not affect mRNA stability. We
observed similar mRNA transcript stability in the Nf1+/-
mouse (Figure 2) although the modest levels of NF1
expression in lymphocytes may preclude detection of
expression differences. Similar transcript stability (as
determined by northern blot analysis) was observed in
the original publication describing the NF1 mouse
model [15], although subsequent work using more sensi-
tive techniques (quantitative PCR) have found modest
expression differences in Nf1 in homogenized brain tis-
sue from Nf1+/-;Trp53+/-cis mice [28].

We found few significant transcripts by permuted t
test and intersection analysis shared among the Coriell-
18, ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups (Table 2,

Figure 5 GSEA analysis of human and mouse expression datasets and ontological categories of LEA gene lists. Up- and down-regulated
statistically significant GSEA gene sets were subjected to LEA analysis and resulting genes were grouped in related ontological categories. The
pie chart diagrams of up- and down-regulated LEA genes are shown on the left and on the right, respectively. The same ontological categories
are represented by the same color on the pie charts. Only the first six most abundant ontological categories are shown for each set. To save
space, the following ontological categories were shortened as follows: Translation -Translation/Protein biosynthesis/Ribosome biogenesis;
Transcription - Transcription/RNA processing; DNA repair - DNA repair/replication/recombination; Cell cycle - Cell cycle/Mitosis/Cytokinesis;
Immune response - Immune/Defense/Antiviral/Inflammatory response.

Figure 3 and Additional file 1), however few transcripts
were validated by qPCR (Table 3). The small number of
statistically significant transcripts may be due to the lim-
ited number of samples or high variability of individual
gene expression levels in the samples. In summary, in
LCLs NF1-haploinsufficiency appears to have a small
effect on the expression of any single transcript.

Because we expect the changes in specific transcripts
to be subtle between wild-type and NF1+/- cells, we
sought evidence for global changes in specific ontologic
categories of genes (and not individual transcripts) per-
turbed by NF1-haploinsufficiency. We chose Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis given its success in identifying
KRAS2 expression [29], JNK signalling [24] and clinical

survival signatures [30] in variety of datasets. To be con-
servative, we used 5000 permutations, set a low false
discovery rate threshold (<0.05) and compared results
across our three expression datasets. Using the leading
edge analysis algorithm in GSEA, we observed striking
similarities in the proportion and ontology of up- and
down-regulated categories in the two human and one
mouse group (Figure 5). Four of the five top up-regu-
lated ontological categories in the ECACC-6 and Nf1-
Mouse-12 groups were identical (cell cycle/mitosis/cyto-
kinesis, DNA repair/replication/recombination, tran-
scription/RNA processing, cell proliferation). Three of
the four top up-regulated ontological categories in the
Coriell-18 group (transcription/RNA processing, DNA
repair/replication/recombination and cell proliferation)
were among the top five categories in ECACC-6 and
Nf1-Mouse-12 groups. The similarities between the
ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups may be due to
similar mutation types: the NF1 mutation in both the
ECACC-6 family and the Nf1+/- mice results in in-frame
exon skipping [15], whereas the mutation in the Coriell-
18 group is predicted to lead to a premature stop
codon. In the Coriell-18 group, the largest up-regulated
category (translation/protein biosynthesis/ribosome bio-
genesis, accounting for ~40% of LEA genes) was not in
the top 14 categories of the ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-
12 groups. Furthermore, there were fewer significant
gene sets enriched in the Coriell-18 group (4 sets) than
in the ECACC-6 (65 sets) and Nf1-Mouse-12 groups
(189 sets), which may make meaningful statistical com-
parisons difficult.

The largest up-regulated category in the GSEA leading
edge analysis of the ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12
groups is cell cycle/mitosis/cytokinesis (e.g. CDC20,
CDC2, FOXM1, MCM3, MCM6, MCM2, CCNB2 -
Additional file 4). This perturbation is consistent with
the known RAS dysregulation observed in NF1-haploin-
sufficiency. The second-most perturbed up-regulated
process in ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12 (and third-
most perturbed in Coriell-18) groups is the DNA repli-
cation/repair/recombination category (e.g. RFC4, FEN1,
RFC3, UNG, RAD51 - Additional file 4). This DNA
damage response (DDR), or activation of genes asso-
ciated with DNA replication/repair/recombination, is
likely secondary to oncogene-associated (e.g. NF1-asso-
ciated dysregulation of RAS) up-regulation of cell cycle/
mitosis/cytokinesis genes [31]. Null or loss-of-function
mutations in genes associated with DNA replication/
repair/recombination are typically deleterious [32]. Para-
doxically, activation of DDR genes themselves (especially
in the context of on-going DNA replication stress) can
result in oncogene-induced DNA damage, genomic
instability and progression in human precancerous
lesions [31]. To our knowledge, oncogene-induced DNA

damage has not been specifically observed in NF1-asso-
ciated tumors, although the murine Nf1+/-;p53+/-cis
model of NF1 malignancies hosts a mild mutator phe-
notype in a wide variety of normal tissues in mice [33].
Our observations of DNA replication/repair/recombina-
tion up-regulation in germline NF1-haploinsufficiency
suggest that subsequent NF1 bi-allelic inactivation and
loss of heterozygosity may be secondary, in part, to
oncogene-induced DNA damage. It is possible that the
perturbations in cell cycle and DNA repair pathways
that we observe apply to tumor suppressor haploinsuffi-
ciency in general, and not NF1 in particular. We are not
aware of similar analyses in other tumor suppressor
genes (e.g. RB).

These observations are largely supported by our analy-
sis with Onto-Express, Pathway-Express and MetaCore
tools (Biological Processes and Pathway Maps). These
methods revealed perturbed cell cycle, mitosis, tran-
scription and DNA replication and repair pathways,
especially in up-regulated genes in the Coriell-18 and
Nf1-Mouse-12 sets. Perturbed immune pathways were
commonly identified in down-regulated genes in Coriell-
18 and Nf1-Mouse-12 sets.

Haploinsufficiency (of any gene) is traditionally viewed
as a passive state in which loss of one allele is insuffi-
cient to maintain the wild-type phenotype. Mouse mod-
elling of Nf1-haploinsufficiency clearly shows a
permissive tumorigenic environment in NF1, although
the actual mechanism is unclear [4]. Evidence from
other tumor-predisposition syndromes suggest that hap-
loinsufficiency is an active state that facilitates cancer
progression [3]. The perturbed, up-regulated pathways
we observed, including those controlling DNA damage
and repair, may functionally contribute to NF1-haploin-
sufficiency as an “active state” that ultimately promotes
the loss of the wild-type allele [3].

Methods
All studies were performed after review by appropriate
NIH institutional review board and animal use and care
committees.

Culture of lymphoblastoid cell lines from human
pedigrees
All NF1-affected and -unaffected banked lymphoblas-
toid cell lines (LCLs; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-trans-
formed peripheral blood B lymphocytes) from two
human kindreds with neurofibromatosis type 1 were
obtained from the Coriell Institute (pedigree 2176;
Camden, NJ, USA) and the European Cell and Culture
Collection (“ECACC,” pedigree P0117; Salisbury, Wilt-
shire, United Kingdom). Cultures were maintained in
an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 in T25 flasks in
medium with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM

L-glutamine, 100 Units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin and 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum (all tissue culture reagents were from Gibco/
Invitogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cultures were grown
to a density from 0.9 × 106 to 1.3 × 106 cells/mL and
harvested in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). To reduce batch effects, manipulation of
NF1-affected and -unaffected cultures was randomized.

NF1 genotyping of human pedigrees
The sample designated by the repository institution as
the proband from each of the two kindreds was geno-
typed for mutations in the gene NF1 [34]. The presence
or absence of the specific mutation was then verified by
PCR and sequencing in all members of the kindred.

Matched groups
We matched nine NF1-affected and nine NF1-unaf-
fected adults (age >15 years) within Coriell pedigree
2176 (“Coriell-18”) and three NF1-affected and three
NF1-unaffected adults within ECACC pedigree P0117
(“ECACC-6”) by age and gender (Table 1). The average
age of NF1-affecteds and -unaffecteds in the Coriell-18
group was 37.9 ± 16.5 and 37.6 ± 12.5 years, respec-
tively. (In the Coriell pedigree, two samples from adults
without a specified age were included in both the
affected and unaffected groups.) The average age of
NF1-affecteds and -unaffecteds in the ECACC-6 group
was 36.7 ± 3.5 and 35.3 ± 5.1 years, respectively.

Evaluation of Nf1+/- and wild-type mice
Six Nf1+/- B6 [15] (three males, three females) and six
wild-type (three males, three females) adult (“Nf1-
Mouse-12”) mice from 5 litters of the same line were
euthanized at the age of eight months with CO2 and the
weights of brain, heart, kidneys, and spleen were
recorded. To rule out the confounding effects of an
occult leukemia, glioma or pheochromocytoma, a com-
plete blood count, lymph node sampling, spleen biopsy,
sternum bone marrow, adrenal gland biopsy and whole-
brain sections were collected and examined histologi-
cally. Males and females were harvested on two different
days.

Isolation of CD19+ spleen B lymphocytes from Nf1+/-
and wild-type mice
The dissected spleens were homogenized with the tip of
a syringe plunger (3 mL syringe, slip tip, BD Biosciences,
Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA, USA) and passed
through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences)
and purified using the CD19 mouse microbeads (Milte-
nyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) on the autoMACS
Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) using the possel_d program,
following the manufacturer’s directions. CD19+ and

CD19- flow-through fractions were collected, and the
purity was assessed by FACS on aliquots using GR1-
FITC, B220-PE, CD3-PerCPCy5.5 and MAC1-APC anti-
bodies (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). The
remaining CD19+ and CD19- fractions were immedi-
ately lysed in 1 mL of the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
and frozen at -80°C.

RNA and DNA isolation
For RNA and DNA isolation, Trizol cell lysates were
mixed with chloroform (1/5 of lysate volume), vortexed
for one minute and centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge
at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase
was used for RNA isolation and the organic phase was
used for DNA isolation. For total RNA isolation, the
aqueous phase was mixed with equal volume of 70%
ethanol and immediately loaded onto RNeasy mini col-
umns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), with subsequent
steps performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The
RNA quality was estimated on a 2100 Bioanalyzer, RNA
6000 Nano Chips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sam-
ples with RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.0 and above
were used for further analysis. Total RNA from mouse
spleen B lymphocytes was analyzed with the Nf1 Taq-
Man quantitative RT-PCR assay (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Genomic DNA isolation from Trizol lysates was
performed as previously reported [35].

Protein isolation and western blotting
Whole cell lysates for protein analysis were prepared
using RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology (Milli-
pore), Billerica, MA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Western blot analysis was done as
described elsewhere [36,37]. All antibodies were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) and used as per the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Signals were developed with the Super Signal
West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotech-
nology Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and visualized by using
Amersham Hyperfilm ECL X-ray film (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). Western blots were stripped for
hybridization with other primary antibodies in Restore
Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) as specified in
the manufacturer’s protocol.

Microarray expression profiling of LCLs and murine
spleen CD19+ B lymphocytes
We performed microarray expression profiling of the
human and mouse samples on single-color Illumina
microarrrays. The human Coriell-18 group was hybri-
dized to the Illumina platform as well as a two-color oli-
gonucleotide array. Illumina expression datasets were
submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE18444 -

Illumina (single-color) microarray gene expression profiling
All reagents, consumables, lab-ware, instruments, and
software were obtained from Illumina Inc., (San Diego,
CA, USA) unless indicated otherwise. RNA amplifica-
tion/labeling, microarray hybridization, and microarray
washing/staining and scanning procedures were done
according to the Illumina protocols without modifica-
tions. Amplified biotinylated cRNA (1.5 μg) was hybri-
dized to either HumanWG-6_v2 or MouseWG-6_v1
Sentrix BeadChips. In all steps, care was exercised to
avoid batch effects. Samples were hybridized to the
microarrays at 55°C for 16-17 hours. Microarrays were
washed to remove non-specifically bound cRNA, stained
with 1 μg/mL Streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare, Piscat-
away, NJ, USA), dried, and scanned in BeadStation 500
scanner. Image acquisition and initial image analysis
were done with Illumina BeadScan and BeadStudio
applications.

zation and data analysis were described elsewhere with
some modifications [38,39]. Briefly, microarray slides
were manufactured at the NHGRI microarray core facil-
ity from 34,580 oligonucleotide probes obtained from
the Human Genome Oligonucleotide Set Version 3.0
from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA, USA). Dried oligonu-
cleotides were resuspended in 3× SSC solution and
spotted on epoxy-coated slides. The slides were then
cleaned by vigorous shaking in a 0.5% SDS solution for
2 min and incubated for 20 min in water at 50°C. The
slides were dried by centrifugation. Total RNA (15 μg)
from LCL samples or 15 μg of Universal Human Refer-
ence RNA (Stratagene/Agilent Technologies, La Jolla,
CA, USA) were reverse transcribed with anchored oligo-
dT primer in the presence of an aminoallyl dUTP. After
purification, the cDNAs from LCLs were coupled with
Cy3 and Universal Human Reference RNA - with Cy5
for 1 h. Labelled samples were column-purified from
unincorporated Cy3 and Cy5. For each sample, total dye
incorporation and total amount of synthesized cDNA
were calculated. Samples with incorporated dye of
greater than 30 picomoles per sample and a nucleotide/
dye ratio of less than 50 were used for the hybridization
step. The labelled cDNAs were then hybridized to the
slides in a 1× In Situ Hybridization buffer (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The hybridization
was done overnight at 60°C in a rotisserie oven (Agilent
Technologies). All subsequent steps were done in an
ozone-free chamber to prevent Cy5 degradation. Slides
were washed in a series of SSC/SDS buffers and dried

by centrifugation. Scanning of microarrrays was done
with a laser confocal scanner (Agilent Technologies),
and the fluorescence intensities were measured in the
spots and their surrounding areas.

Statistical analysis of microarray data
Permuted t test and multiple testing correction
Raw data from the Illumina BeadChips for both human
and mouse experiments was corrected for background
and quantile normalized using BeadExplorer (version
1.5.0), a Bioconductor module developed for quality
control, normalization, annotation and exploration of
Illumina BeadChip data [40]. Raw data from arrays from
the NHGRI Microarray Facility was corrected for back-
ground and normalized by median shift using the
DEARRAY IPLab image processing package (Scanalytics,
Fairfax, VA, USA). All expression values were log2
transformed. Expression datasets were formatted and
imported into BRB-ArrayTools (developed by Drs.
Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam, version 3.4.1) [41]
and ArrayAnalysis [42] statistical packages. To identify
statistically significant genes, we used the “Class com-
parison” and “F-test/T-test” analyses in BRB-ArrayTools
and ArrayAnalysis, respectively. The false discovery rate
(FDR), a permutation-based approach for multiple com-
parisons problem was used for identification of statisti-
cally significant genes.
Intersection (hypergeometric) analysis: Coriell-18 vs
ECACC-6 vs Nf1-Mouse-12
Transcripts in the two human and mouse groups were
ranked by their nominal P values and the top ~5% of
genes from each list were chosen for intersection analy-
sis. Before comparison, all mouse transcripts were con-
verted to their human homologues. We used the
hypergeometric distribution function and Fisher exact
test to determine the significance of the overlap of spe-
cific genes between the human and mouse groups.
Intersection (hypergeometric) analysis: Illumina vs. spotted
oligonucleotide arrays
Permuted t tests were performed for the expression
dataset on Coriell-18 from both the Illumina and
spotted oligonucleotide arrays. After ranking transcripts
by their nominal P values and filtering out transcripts
not expressed in both expression datasets, the signifi-
cance of the intersection analysis for the ~5% top-rank-
ing genes from the lists was determined using the
hypergeometric distribution function and Fisher exact
test.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
We selectively validated a group of 22 transcripts
(twelve human and ten mouse) for quantitative PCR
(qPCR) validation. We chose transcripts that were either
statistically significant by t tests or intersection analysis.

All reagents, consumables, instruments, protocols, and
software used in the gene expression analyses were
obtained from Applied Biosystems. Total RNA samples
were adjusted to 100 ng/μL and used for cDNA synth-
esis with High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA preps were
used in real-time qPCR without further purification and
were kept frozen at -20°C when not in use. All real-time
qPCR analyses in this study were performed with Taq-
Man gene expression assays. One μL of an unpurified
cDNA mix was used as an input for an individual qPCR
reaction. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, cDNA
and TaqMan gene expression assays were mixed accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reactions were per-
formed in 384-well plates with 20 μL of reaction mix
per well. Expression analysis of each gene in each sam-
ple was done in triplicates. Human and mouse GAPDH/
Gapdh gene expression assays were used as normaliza-
tion controls. All reactions were done in a 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System instrument using the default
amplification protocol. Relative quantitation of gene
expression was done using “double delta Ct” method
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
The GSEA analysis was performed as described else-
where [43]. Briefly, Illumina expression datasets were
background-corrected and quintile normalized and
loaded into the application along with phenotype label
and chip annotations files. Analysis was performed
against the entire GSEA database (June 2009), which
after filtering out gene sets smaller than 15 and larger
than 500 genes (as recommended) included ~3400 gene
sets. “Permutation type” parameter was chosen as “gene-
set” for all sample sets, since one of them (ECACC-6)
was comprised of fewer than twelve samples. Five thou-
sand permutations were performed for each sample set.
The FDR threshold for statistically significant gene sets
was set at 0.05. Gene sets with FDR at or below 0.05
were submitted to a leading edge analysis (LEA). LEA
extracts the genes that contributed most significantly to
the enrichment score. An ontological analysis ("Biologi-
cal Process” in Gene Ontology and UniProt databases)
of the LEA gene lists was performed for the genes,
which were present in at least 10% of statistically signifi-
cant gene sets submitted for the LEA. In cases when
fewer than 20 significant gene sets were identified, we
either performed LEA with gene sets with the best 20
FDR scores (Nf1-Mouse-12 down-regulated gene sets)
or performed ontological analysis for the genes in the
LEA list which were present in at least two gene groups
(Coriell-18 up-regulated gene sets). For ontological ana-
lysis, each gene was placed into one or more categories,
and closely related categories were bundled together (for

instance, “DNA repair”, “DNA replication”, “DNA
damage”, “DNA recombination” categories were bundled
into the “DNA repair/replication/recombination” cate-
gory). There was a single significant gene set down-
regulated in ECACC-6 group, and therefore the LEA
could not be performed.

Ontological analysis of differentially expressed genes with
Onto-Express, Pathway-Express and MetaCore tools
Up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes
(t test P < 0.05) in Coriell-18, ECACC-6 and Nf1-
Mouse-12 sample sets were subject to ontological analy-
sis with Onto-Express [16,17], Pathway-Express [18,19]
and MetaCore tools (GeneGo, Inc.) as per the authors’
or manufacturer’s guidelines. In the Onto-Express and
MetaCore analyses, a hypergeometric distribution was
used for calculating nominal P values and the FDR pro-
cedure was used for correction of multiple testing. In
the Pathway-Express analysis, the default settings were
used except for the “Correction” option; FDR was
selected as a multiple testing correction procedure.
Ontological categories and pathways with FDR values
equal or less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Additional file 1: Intersection analysis of Coriell-18, ECACC-6 and
Nf1 -Mouse-12 expression datasets. The most differentially expressed
genes (top 5 per cent) from the human and mouse sets were used for
intersection analysis. The results of a pair-wise and three-way intersection
analysis are shown. See also Figure 3.
Additional file 2: Comparison of fold difference values of the most
differentially expressed genes on Illumina and NHGRI microarrays.
Samples from Coriell-18 set were analyzed in parallel on Illumina and
NHGRI microarrays. Intersection analysis of the most differentially
expressed transcripts from two platforms was performed, and the
expression fold difference (Affecteds vs. Unaffecteds) was calculated for
each transcript found in the overlap between the two platforms. See also
Figure 4.
Additional file 3: Quantitative PCR validation of microarray data for
select human and mouse genes. Twelve human genes were subject to
qPCR validation in the human Coriell-18 and ECACC-6 sets. Ten mouse
genes were subject to qPCR validation in the murine Nf1-Mouse-12 set.
Both microarray and qPCR expression values in NF1-affecteds and Nf1+/-
mice were normalized to expression values in NF1-unaffecteds or wild-
type mice, respectively. Expression values in NF1-unaffecteds and wild-
type mice were arbitrary set at 1.0. Red bars denote mean expression in
NF1-affecteds on microarrays, blue bars denote mean expression in NF1-
unaffecteds on microarrays; orange bars denote mean expression in NF1-
affecteds by qPCR; and green bars denote mean expression in NF1-
unaffecteds by qPCR. Gene names are shown below each set of bars.
Sample set names are shown on top of each plot. Error bars are equal to
one standard deviation. Asterisks above bars denote genes validated by
qPCR (nominal P value < 0.05).
Additional file 4: Leading edge analysis identifies transcripts that
are most frequently present in the significant gene sets. Leading
edge analysis of significant GSEA gene sets was performed, and the
transcripts were ranked by the total number of times they are present in
statistically significant gene sets. See also Figure 5.
Additional file 5: Ontological annotation of transcripts identified by
leading edge analysis. Up- and down-regulated transcripts identified by
leading edge analysis were ontologically annotated, and similar or
related categories were combined. The resulting categories were ranked
by the number of transcripts included in each category.

Additional file 6: Ontological analysis of differentially expressed
genes with Onto-Express. Functional profiles based on Gene Ontology
(GO) biological processes terms were created for up- and down-
regulated transcripts in two human and a mouse sample sets. For each
set of transcripts, statistically significant ontological categories were
determined by the hypergeometric test, followed by a multiple testing
correction procedure (FDR). Only categories with FDR below the
threshold (0.05) are shown. Note that there are no significant categories
in the lists of down-regulated transcripts in ECACC-6 and Nf1-Mouse-12
sets.
Additional file 7: Pathway level analysis of differentially expressed
genes with Pathway-Express. Differentially expressed genes in two
human and a mouse sample sets were compared to known cellular
pathways in the KEGG database, followed by impact factor computation
and FDR correction. Statistically significant pathways (FDR < 0.05) and
their impact factors (IF) are shown for each sample set.
Additional file 8: Ontological analysis of differentially expressed
genes with MetaCore tools. Ontological profiling similar to that
described in Additional file 7 was performed using proprietary MetaCore
software and GO database. P values and FDR (not shown in the tables)
were calculated for each category. Only categories with FDR below
threshold (0.05) are shown. Note that there are no significant categories
in the set of Nf1-Mouse-12 down-regulated transcripts.
Additional file 9: Pathway level analysis of differentially expressed
genes with MetaCore tools. Up- and down-regulated genes in two
human and a mouse sample sets were analyzed with GeneGo pathway
maps database. P values and FDR (not shown in the tables) were
calculated for each pathway. Only pathways with FDR below threshold
(0.05) are shown. Note that there are no significant pathways in the sets
of down-regulated transcripts.
Additional file 10: Dynamic change of neurofibromin level in
lymphoblastoid cell lines in response to serum deprivation. We
determined the effects of serum deprivation on neurofibromin level as a
way to establish the physiologic relevance of lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs) in the study of NF1-haploinsufficiency. We measured levels of
neurofibromin in two LCLs (one each from NF1-affected, and -unaffected
individuals) that were serum-deprived (0.1% serum) for 16 hours, and
then released for variable amounts of time in complete (10% serum;
supports cell proliferation), or incomplete (1% serum; does not support
cell proliferation) medium. Western blot analysis and quantitation of
relative abundance of neurofibromin in an NF1-unaffected individual (A)
and an NF1-affected individual (B). NF1 abundance data is shown to the
right from respective western blot and is plotted as percentage relative
to NF1 abundance in exponentially growing cells. “E” - exponentially
growing LCLs; “S” - serum starved LCLs; 5’, 30’, 7 h - cells released into
media containing either 1% or 10% FBS for 5 min, 30 min or 7 hours,
respectively. Our experiment showed that the amount of neurofibromin
increased approximately two-fold in serum-starved cells as compared to
that in exponentially growing LCLs from both affected and unaffected
individuals. When the cells were released into complete medium (10%
FBS), the neurofibromin level quickly returned to pre-starvation levels in
both NF1-affected and -unaffected LCLs. In contrast, the neurofibromin
level continued to increase during prolonged incubation of the cells in
incomplete medium (1% FBS). We conclude that in LCLs neurofibromin
level is sensitive to environmental conditions.
