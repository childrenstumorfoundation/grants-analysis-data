Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression
of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion
G Fischer1, B Pan1, D Vilceanu1, QH Hogan1,2 and H Yu1

The Ca2 þ channel-binding domain 3 (CBD3) peptide, derived from the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), is a recently
discovered voltage-gated Ca2 þ channel (VGCC) blocker with a preference for CaV2.2. Rodent administration of CBD3 conjugated to
cell penetrating motif TAT (TAT-CBD3) has been shown to reduce pain behavior in inﬂammatory and neuropathic pain models.
However, TAT-CBD3 analgesia has limitations, including short half-life, lack of cellular speciﬁcity and undesired potential off-site
effects. We hypothesized that these issues could be addressed by expressing CBD3 encoded by high-expression vectors in primary
sensory neurons. We constructed an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing recombinant ﬂuorescent CBD3 peptide and
injected it into lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of rats before spared nerve injury (SNI). We show that selective expression of
enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP)-CBD3 in lumbar 4 (L4) and L5 DRG neurons and their axonal projections results in
effective attenuation of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in the SNI model. We conclude that AAV-encoded CBD3 delivered to
peripheral sensory neurons through DRG injection may be a valuable approach for exploring the role of presynaptic VGCCs and
long-term modulation of neurotransmission, and may also be considered for development as a gene therapy strategy to treat
chronic neuropathic pain.

INTRODUCTION
Peripheral nerve injury often leads to persistent neuropathic pain
through altered function of primary sensory neurons and central
nervous system pain pathways.1 Voltage-gated Ca2 þ channels
(VGCCs) have a key role in upregulated sensory neuron excitability
and enhanced transmission of pain signals in neuropathic pain.2
Pharmacological and genetic studies implicate N-type Ca2 þ
channels (CaV2.2) as the principal mediator of pain transmission
in the dorsal horn,3,4 and inhibition of CaV2.2 is an emerging
strategy in pain treatment.5 T-type low-voltage-activated Ca2 þ
channels additionally contribute to neuropathic pain by elevating
sensory neuron excitability after nerve injury.6

transmission.7,8 CaV2.2

membrane trafﬁcking induced by interaction with CRMP-2 and
CaV2.2 can be effectively disrupted by a short peptide
corresponding to a 15 amino-acid region of CRMP-2, designated
as Ca2 þ channel-binding domain 3 (CBD3).8,9 Importantly, rodent
administration by intraperitoneal or systemic injection of CBD3
peptide conjugated to the cell-penetrating motif of the HIV
transduction domain protein TAT (TAT-CBD3) has been shown to
reduce hypersensitive behavior in chemical-induced inﬂammatory
and neuropathic pain models.9–12 Functional evaluations show
that TAT-CBD3 reduces CaV2.2-mediated currents by inhibiting
CRMP-2 binding to CaV2.2, and also reduces T-type currents, which
together result in reduced nociceptor excitability, diminished

neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and lower excitatory
synaptic transmission.11 These observations suggest that CBD3
has the potential for development as a therapeutic agent in pain
management. However, the analgesia produced by systematic
application of TAT-CBD3 is hampered by its inherent instability,
short half-life and other characteristics of systemic peptide
therapy, such as lack of anatomic and cellular speciﬁcity, as well
for undesired off-target effects triggered by
as the potential

addition, while effective in reducing non-traumatic neuropathic
pain behavior, TAT-CBD treatment had no effect on mechanical
hypersensitivity in traumatic neuropathic pain.10

the efﬁcacy and safety could be
signiﬁcantly improved by anatomically restricted expression of
therapeutic CBD3 peptide encoded by high-expression vectors in
the involved pain pathway. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons
become hyperexcitable after peripheral nerve injury,13,14 and are
the presynaptic neurons at the critical ﬁrst synapse in the dorsal
horn, making them an attractive target for pharmacotherapy.

highly useful vectors for transferring genes into DRG neurons with

AAV-encoded CBD3 for neuropathic pain
G Fischer et al

The present study was designed to test the efﬁcacy of an AAV
vector encoding recombinant ﬂuorescent CBD3 injected into
lumbar DRGs proximal to peripheral nerve damage. We hypothe-
sized that
this would produce a therapeutic level of CBD3
continuously and selectively in the DRG neurons and their central
presynaptic terminals, resulting in analgesic neuromodulation.
Using the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) model of persistent
peripheral neuropathic pain, we have found that selective
expression of enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP)-CBD3
in lumbar 4 (L4) and L5 DRG neurons and their central and
peripheral axonal processes prevents nerve injury-induced
neuropathic pain.

chosen because we have found that
this serotype provides

the nociceptive sub-population and their axonal terminals.23 Both
the L4 and L5 DRGs were injected with either AAV6-EGFP-CBD3 or
AAV6-EGFP (5.0 109 viral particles each). After 2 weeks, nerve
injury was induced by SNI surgery. Four weeks following this,

indicative of transport of
EGFP-CBD3 to the peripheral processes of transduced sensory
neurons. Similar patterns of EGFP-ir in the DRG neurons and their
axonal projections were detected following AAV6-EGFP injection
(data not shown), as previously reported.23 Western blots of DRG
tissue homogenates identiﬁed the EGFP-CBD3 fusion protein
based on the size disparity between EGFP-CBD3 and EGFP,
indicating stability of EGFP-CBD3 structure during intraganglionic
expression (Figure 1i). Together, these observations indicate that
intraganglionic microinjection of AAV6 encoding CBD3 produces
long-term expression of ﬂuorescent CBD3 selectively in DRG
neurons and their central and peripheral axonal terminals.

therefore examined the efﬁcacy of sustained expression in
sensory neurons of
the EGFP-CBD3 transgene on current
sensitive to the selective N-type ICa blocker o-Conotoxin-GVIA
(GVIA, 200 nM).24 Using a whole-cell patch-clamp approach and
conditions to isolate ICa, transduced neurons identiﬁed by EGFP
ﬂuorescence (Figure 2a) were held at   60 mV, hyperpolarized to
  100 mV for 1 s, and then depolarized for 200 ms to þ 40 mV in
10 mV increments. Peak ICa, which occurred at   10 to 0 mV, did
not differ between neurons expressing EGFP (158±11 pA/pF,
n¼ 10) and EGFP-CBD3 (134±18 pA/pF, n¼ 9; P¼ 0.26). During
subsequent application of GVIA, neurons were depolarized by test
pulses to 0 mV, which fully activates N-type ICa in sensory
neurons24 (Figures 2b and c). Trace subtraction demonstrated
that current sensitive to GVIA was reduced in neurons expressing
EGFP-CBD3 compared with EGFP alone (Po0.05; Figure 2d), and

that this N-type current represented a reduced fraction of the total
ICa in neurons expressing EGFP-CBD3 (26±4%) compared with
EGFP alone (42±3%, Po0.01), which indicate the efﬁcacy of the
EGFP-CBD3 construct in reducing N-type ICa.

CBD3 has also been noted to suppress low-voltage-activated

(Figure 2e), and correcting the current peak by
currents

EGFP-CBD3 developed less
than neurons
expressing EGFP alone (Po0.01; Figure 2f). Non-transduced
neurons had T-type current (29.8±4.0 pA/pF, n¼ 10) that did
not differ from currents in neurons expressing EGFP alone. Thus,
chronic expression of the EGFP-CBD3 construct has efﬁcacy in

EGFP-CBD3 expression does not reverse SNI-induced
inﬂammatory response
Apart from direct modulation of membrane channel function, it is
possible that analgesia induced by EGFP-CBD3 expression may
result from reduction in the inﬂammatory processes in the DRG
and spinal cord that follow peripheral nerve injury.27 Conversely, it
is also possible that vector injection and/or transgene expression
could enhance inﬂammation, and thereby account
the
incomplete efﬁcacy of CBD3 analgesia after SNI. We therefore
examined DRGs and spinal cords from injected animals (n¼ 3 for
each vector) for Iba1-ir, which identiﬁes microglial activation and
macrophage accumulation, and for GFAP-ir, which identiﬁes
satellite glial cell and astrocyte activation. Tissue was collected 6
weeks after DRG injection and 4 weeks after SNI. Compared with
uninjured animals, the DRGs of SNI rats receiving vehicle, AAV6-
EGFP or AAV6-EGFP-CBD3 injections all developed comparable
increases in both GFAP-ir and Iba1-ir, as glial rings surrounding
neuronal somata (Figure 4a). Similarly, the ipsilateral spinal cords
of all SNI animals developed elevated astrocyte and microglial
staining with hypertrophic cell bodies,
regardless of DRG
injections (Figure 4b). These results indicate that the EGFP-CBD3
expression does not suppress nerve injury-triggered inﬂammatory
reactions in the DRG or the spinal cord, nor does it likely
contribute to these changes.

DISCUSSION
Small peptide aptamers targeting protein–protein interactions in
pain signaling pathways have recently gained increasing interest
as research tools and as potential pharmacological agents for
treating chronic pain. Speciﬁc peptide motifs derived from

neurons and their central and peripheral processes, and provides
sustained pain relief with minimal toxicity. These results provide
clear evidence of the therapeutic potential of Ca2 þ channel

AAV-encoded CBD3 for neuropathic pain
G Fischer et al

We chose VGCCs as an initial molecular target due to their
central role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic
transmission. CaV2.2 is the critical source of Ca2 þ inﬂux that
triggers neurotransmitter release in pain transmission in the
spinal cord dorsal horn.34 Furthermore, presynaptic expression of
CaV2.2 may increase in chronic pain states35 with resulting
increase in dependence of nociceptive pain transmission upon
CaV2.2.36 These features make it an ideal target for presynaptic
modulation of chronic pain.37 Indeed,
the selective CaV2.2
peptide blocker o-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide, Prialt, Elan
Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA, USA)
is marketed for
clinical use by intrathecal
infusion, during which intense
analgesia can be achieved but at the cost of a very high
frequency of brain toxicity-related complications.38 Clearly,
limiting CaV2.2 blockade to the presynaptic sensory neurons is
a more desirable strategy.

This study was not designed to determine the site of action at
which expression of CBD3 within the sensory neuron produces
analgesia. However, since both CRMP-2 and CaV2.2 are expressed
throughout
their
interaction can occur at multiple sites.7 Diminished ICa at the
sensory neuron terminals in the dorsal horn may have a
substantial analgesic effect due to the steep dependence of
neurotransmitter release upon Ca2 þ inﬂux.39 Others have found

would be reﬁning the vector design, such as targeting the CBD3
preferentially to the presynaptic membrane.43 An additional
hypothesis to explain incomplete efﬁcacy of our construct is
insufﬁcient blocking effect of the CBD3 peptide against CaV2.2.
Approaches to improve its efﬁcacy could include employing a
recently described variant CBD3 sequence with enhanced inherent
efﬁcacy,11 or designing the construct to express a concatemerized

Overall, our ﬁndings show that AAV delivery of a small

incomplete, absolute elimination of chronic pain in a clinical
setting is not a requirement for successful treatment. The
features of highly accurate anatomic targeting and molecular
speciﬁcity of the expressed peptide indicate that this approach
has the potential for translation into an effective therapeutic
approach.

AAV2 replication gene and capsid gene from AAV6 (Viromics, Fremont, CA,

separated by oligonucleotides encoding a 22 amino-acid linker
(SGLRSRAQASNSAVDGTAGPGS) derived from the polylinker regions of
pEGFPc1. The resultant plasmid was named as pscAAV-EGFP-CBD3. The
recombinant AAV was packaged by triple-plasmid CaPO4 co-transfection
of 293T cells. Virions were Optiprep puriﬁed, concentrated with Centricon
Plus-20 (Regenerated Cellulose 100 000 MWCO; Millipore, Billerica, MA,

is B10 kDa larger than EGFP (Supplementary Figure S1a). Comparable
purity of AAV6-EGFP-CBD3 and AAV6-EGFP was conﬁrmed by silver

FL, USA). Removal of the pipette was delayed for an additional 5 min to
minimize the extrusion of the injectate. Following the injection and closure
of overlying muscle and skin, the animals were returned to the animal
house where they remained for 4 weeks.

Spared nerve injury
SNI produces consistent, reliable and long-lasting post-traumatic neuro-
pathic pain behaviors featuring mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia,
and hypersensitivity to cold induced by acetone application.26,46 For SNI
surgery, animals were anesthetized by exposure to isoﬂurane (1–3%). The
surgical ﬁeld (right leg) was shaved and disinfected. An incision (B2 cm)
was made on the lateral mid-thigh and the underlying muscles separated
to expose the sciatic nerve, and the tibial and common peroneal were
individually ligated with 6.0 sutures and cut distally to the ligature, and
2–3 mm of each nerve was removed distal of the ligation. The sural nerve
was preserved and contact with it was avoided. Muscle and skin were
closed using 4.0 monoﬁlament nylon sutures.

Pain behavioral evaluation
Behavioral tests were carried out as previously described.16 Mechanical
withdrawal threshold testing (von Frey) was performed using calibrated

monoﬁlaments (Patterson Medical, Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Brieﬂy, beginning
with the 2.8-g ﬁlament, ﬁlaments were applied with just enough force to
bend the ﬁber and held for 1 s. If a response was observed, then the next
smaller ﬁlament was applied, and if no response was observed, then the
next larger was applied, until a reversal occurred, deﬁned as a withdrawal
after a previous lack of withdrawal, or vice versa. Following a reversal
event, four more stimulations were performed following the same pattern.
The forces of the ﬁlaments before and after the reversal, and the four
ﬁlaments applied following the reversal, were used to calculate the 50%
withdrawal threshold. Rats not responding to any ﬁlament were assigned a
score of 25 g. Noxious punctate mechanical stimulation (pin test) was
performed using the point of a 22-g spinal anesthesia needle that was
applied to the center of the hindpaw with enough force to indent the skin
but not puncture it. Five applications were separated by at least 10 s, which
was repeated after 2 min, making a total of 10 touches. For each
application,
the induced behavior was either a very brisk, simple
withdrawal with immediate return of the foot to the cage ﬂoor, or a
sustained elevation with grooming that included licking and chewing, and
possibly shaking, which lasted at least 1 s.47 This hyperalgesic behavior is
speciﬁcally associated with place avoidance.48 Hyperalgesia was quantiﬁed
by tabulating hyperalgesia responses as a percentage of total touches.

Brieﬂy, homogenates from DRGs injected with AAV6-EGFP-CBD3 or
AAV6-EGFP were loaded onto SDS–PAGE, transferred, and probed with
a polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling).
Immuno-
reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) after incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(1:2000, SCB). Lysate of HEK293T cells transduced with AAV6-EGFP-CBD3 or
AAV6-EGFP was extracted as the positive controls. GAPDH was used as a
loading control.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recording
To determine the effect of EGFP-CBD3, recordings were made from
neurons dissociated from the L4 and L5 DRGs of uninjured rats that had
been injected with either AAV6-EGFP or AAV6-EGFP-CBD3. Following
decapitation under deep isoﬂurane anesthesia, ganglia were removed and
placed in a 35-mm dish containing Ca2 þ /Mg2 þ -free, cold HBBS (Life
Technologies) and cut into 4–6 pieces that were incubated in 0.5 mg ml   1

Electrodes with a resistance of 2–4 MO were pulled from borosilicate
glass (Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA, USA) using a micropipette puller
(P-97 Sutter Instrument Co, Novato, CA, USA) and ﬁre polished. Recording
was performed in the whole-cell conﬁguration with an Axopatch 700B
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After whole-cell
ampliﬁer
conﬁguration was established, electrical compensation for
the cell
membrane capacitance and series resistance were initiated. Access
typically between 5 and 7 MO and was 80–90%
resistance was
compensated. Since peak currents measured in our experiment were
around 3 nA, voltage errors introduced by the residual uncompensated
access resistance (o1.0 MO) were o3 mV and could not introduce major
errors. Neurons with 410 MO access resistance after breakthrough were
discarded. Experiments were performed 5 min after breakthrough, and at
room temperature (B25 1C). Signals were ﬁltered at 2 kHz through a 4-pole
Bessel ﬁlter, and digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1440 A A/D interface
(Molecular Devices). Seals were achieved in modiﬁed Tyrode’s consisting of
(in mM) NaCl 140, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, D-glucose 10, and 4-
(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) 10, at a pH
of 7.4, and with an osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Currents through VGCCs
were recorded using an extracellular solution consisting of BaCl2 2,
4-aminophyridine 1, HEPES 10, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) 140,
and HEPES 10, at a pH of 7.4, and with an osmolarity of 300 mOsm. The
internal pipette solution contained CsCl 110, TEACl 20, Mg-ATP 4,
Na-GTP 0.3, ethylene glycol-bis(2-amino-ethylether)-N,N, N’, N’-tetra-acetic
acid (EGTA) 11, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Li4-GTP and HEPES 10, at a
pH of 7.2, and with an osmolarity of 300 mOsm. To selectively record low-
voltage-activated T-type currents, we used a pipette solution that
contained ﬂuoride to facilitate high-voltage-activated ICa rundown.49 This
solution contained tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMA-OH) 135, EGTA
10, HEPES 40 and MgCl2 2, adjusted to pH 7.2 with hydroﬂuoric acid, and
with an osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Data from whole-cell ICa recordings were
evaluated with Axograph X 1.3.5 (AxoGraph Scientiﬁc, Sydney, Australia),
with which peak inward currents and charge transfer were measured. To
correct for cell size, inward currents are expressed as a function of cell
capacitance (pA/pF).

Statistical analyses
Results are reported as mean and variability as s.e.m. A probability of
Po0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant. For continuous variables (von Frey),
within-group testing was performed using one-way ANOVA with repeated
measures, with separate tests for each vector, both before and after injury.
Comparisons to baseline for each group were performed using Dunnet’s
test. For non-continuous variables (pin and cold), the non-parametric
Friedman’s ANOVA was used, with paired comparisons to baseline with
Dunn’s test. For comparisons between groups, data before and after injury
for each vector were transformed to area under the curve. Area under the
curve values were compared between vectors both before and after injury
by the Mann–Whitney U test. All analyses were performed using Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
