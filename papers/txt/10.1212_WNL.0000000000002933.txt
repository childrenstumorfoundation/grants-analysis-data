ABSTRACT
Objective: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, benign nerve sheath tumors that occur in approx-
imately 25%–50% of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PNs that cause airway compro-
mise or pulmonary dysfunction are uncommon but clinically important. Because improvement in sleep
quality or airway function represents direct clinical benefit, measures of sleep and pulmonary function
may be more meaningful than tumor size as endpoints in therapeutic clinical trials targeting airway PN.
Methods: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis functional out-
comes group reviewed currently available endpoints for sleep and pulmonary outcomes and
developed consensus recommendations for response evaluation in NF clinical trials.
Results: For patients with airway PNs, polysomnography, impulse oscillometry, and spirometry
should be performed to identify abnormal function that will be targeted by the agent under clinical
investigation. The functional group endorsed the use of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as the pri-
mary sleep endpoint, and pulmonary resistance at 10 Hz (R10) or forced expiratory volume in 1 or
0.75 seconds (FEV1 or FEV0.75) as primary pulmonary endpoints. The group defined minimum
changes in AHI, R10, and FEV1 or FEV0.75 for response criteria. Secondary sleep outcomes
include desaturation and hypercapnia during sleep and arousal index. Secondary pulmonary out-
comes include pulmonary resistance and reactance measurements at 5, 10, and 20 Hz; forced
vital capacity; peak expiratory flow; and forced expiratory flows.
Conclusions: These recommended sleep and pulmonary evaluations are intended to provide re-
searchers with a standardized set of clinically meaningful endpoints for response evaluation in tri-
als of NF1-related airway PNs. Neurology® 2016;87 (Suppl 1):S13–S20

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, benign nerve sheath tumors that occur in approx-
imately 25%–50% of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The frequency and type
of PN-associated morbidities are influenced by tumor location and volume (figure).1–7 A total of
15%–38% of all PNs occur in the head/neck region and 6%–25% occur in the thorax/medi-
astinum. Airway PNs are a subset of PNs that arise in close proximity to the airway. Symptom-
atic PNs that cause airway compromise or pulmonary dysfunction are uncommon (reported in
5%–7% of children with PNs) but clinically important. If left untreated, these lesions can be
fatal. Surgical resection is often not feasible, and tracheostomy is required in some patients.3,5
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by repeated collapse of the airway during sleep re-
sulting in partial obstruction (hypopnea) or total obstruction (apnea). In the general pediatric

population, risk factors include adenotonsillar
hypertrophy, obesity, airway encroachment,
abnormal respiratory control, and dysfunc-
tional upper
airway muscles. Symptoms
include snoring, pauses in breathing, and
excessive sleepiness. However, there is only
a modest correlation between OSA symptoms
and objectively measured polysomnographic
parameters of OSA severity.8,9 Overnight pol-
ysomnography (PSG) is the study of choice for
patients with suspected OSA.10,11 The most
widely used measure of PSG is the apnea hy-
popnea index (AHI), the number of apneas

plus hypopneas/h of sleep. The American
Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) provides
2 definitions of hypopneas for adults: the def-
inition requiring 3% desaturation or arousal
should be used; this definition is consistent
with the pediatric definition.12 In children,
a normal AHI is ,1.5. In adults, a normal
AHI is ,5; the degree of OSA can be classified
as mild (AHI 5–14), moderate (AHI 15–30),
or severe (AHI .30). Treatment of OSA is
directed at maintaining patency of the upper
airway. Adenotonsillectomy is the standard
treatment for childhood OSA,11 and continu-
ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the
standard treatment if surgery is not an option.
Pulmonary function tests are used to evalu-
ate patients with airway and lung disease.
Impulse oscillometry measures airway mechan-
ics by applying pressure oscillations that propa-
gate throughout the airway as the patient tidal
breathes in a stable pattern. It is used to mea-
sure pulmonary resistance (pressure required
to propagate flow through the respiratory sys-
tem) and reactance (pressure required to over-
come elastic and inertive properties of the
respiratory system).13 Spirometry measures the
amount (volume) or speed (flow) of air that can
be inhaled and exhaled. Forced vital capacity
(FVC) is the maximal volume of air exhaled
from full inspiration.

Previously, the Response Evaluation in Neu-
rofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS)
group published recommendations for hearing
and facial function outcomes.14 In this report,
the group proposes consensus recommenda-
tions for sleep and pulmonary outcomes in clin-
ical trials that target airway PNs. In recent years,
shrinkage of PNs has been observed after treat-
ment with PEG-intron, imatinib, and selume-
tinib.15–17 Because clinical benefit may occur
with minimal volume changes, sleep and pul-
monary outcomes may be more sensitive than
radiographic changes at detecting a meaningful
response to treatment. Our objectives were to
define reproducible and clinically meaningful
measures of sleep and pulmonary function,
which can be used as primary endpoints in clin-
ical trials targeting airway PNs.

METHODS The REiNS functional outcomes group has
approximately 20 active participants including professionals from
various disciplines involved in NF care. The group engaged

experts in sleep and pulmonary medicine (C.L.M., S.D.D., J.A.)
to help draft these recommendations, which represent expert con-
sensus based on review of the literature.

RESULTS For patients with airway PNs, overnight
PSG, impulse oscillometry, and spirometry should
be performed during screening to identify abnormal
function. Based on performance on these studies, in-
vestigators should select a primary measure that will
serve as the functional endpoint of interest for each
patient. Once a measure has been selected as the pri-
mary functional endpoint, it should be tested consis-
tently during a clinical trial with reference to baseline.
Recommended PSG outcomes. For clinical trial out-
comes, the group considered the following measures
as primary or secondary endpoints: AHI, oxygen satu-
ration, end tidal CO2, and arousal index (table 1). The
group recommended use of AHI as primary outcome
because it (1) is a clinically meaningful measure of
upper airway function; (2) is widely available at most
centers; (3) is the most commonly used endpoint in
both pediatric and adult sleep studies, including the
effects of adenotonsillectomy, upper airway stimula-
tion, and bariatric surgery for OSA18–20; and (4) has
been validated in relation to neurocognitive and car-
diovascular outcomes of OSA.21,22 To date, no studies
using AHI for patients with NF1 with airway PNs have
been published.

Feasibility. PSG is widely available in most devel-
oped countries and a full-night study should be
performed in a sleep laboratory.23,24 The detailed pa-
rameters, settings, filters, technical specifications, and
event scoring should be done in accordance with the
guidelines in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of
Sleep and Associated Events.12 Note that the criteria

for scoring of obstructive apnea in children differ
from those in adults.

Patient characteristics. PSG has been validated in
adults and in children, with standardized norms avail-
able for children. Physical examination should be per-
formed to document obesity and signs of upper
airway narrowing such as tonsillar hypertrophy, retro-
gnathia, macroglossia, enlarged uvula, abnormal hard
palate, and nasal abnormalities. Potential participants
should be evaluated by a qualified practitioner prior
to enrollment to determine whether adenotonsillec-
tomy may result in sufficient improvement in airway
function. Patients who meet the criteria for baseline
AHI noted below may be considered eligible for trials;
patients with an AHI ,5 would be ineligible based
on the criteria defined for improvement. Patients
with tracheostomy are not eligible for trials with pri-
mary sleep outcomes but may be appropriate for trials
with primary imaging outcomes.

Currently, the group does not endorse the use of
home sleep studies in clinical trials. This recommen-
dation is based on the paucity of validation studies for
children, the limited number of EEG channels in
home studies, and the lack of reliable CO2 monitor-
ing (which is important for identifying individuals
with hypoventilation). This recommendation should
be reconsidered as additional data on home sleep
studies in young children become available.

Sleep efficiency (total sleep time as a percentage of
total recording time), the amount of REM sleep as
a percentage of total sleep time, and body position
should be measured to assess the adequacy of PSG.
If a patient sleeps very poorly in the laboratory setting
and has decreased total sleep time or REM sleep time,
the AHI may appear artificially low. Body position

at study initiation.

may affect the severity of OSA. While this is generally
less of an issue in children than adults,25 it may be
important in patients with airway tumors. Serial stud-
ies with large differences in the percentage of time in
different body positions should be interpreted with
caution. Protocols should provide explicit guidance
for assessing adequacy of sleep studies in clinical trials.
In general, a PSG is considered adequate if there are at
least 6 hours of total sleep time (as measured by EEG,
not total recording time) and at least an hour of REM
sleep (as most sleep-disordered breathing occurs dur-
ing REM sleep).

Response criteria. AHI response criteria are defined
in reference to the baseline AHI at study initiation.
Studies of night-to-night variation in AHI suggest
that individuals with higher AHI at baseline demon-
strate more variability than individuals with lower
AHI.26,27 Thus, the group recommended a larger
absolute change in AHI for patients with higher base-
line AHI in order to minimize the rate of false-
positive or false-negative responses.26,27 Additional
studies on night-to-night variation in AHI for pa-
tients with NF1 with airway PN are needed to refine
these response criteria. Until these studies are com-
plete, the functional group recommends using criteria
based on expert opinion (table 2).

Functional improvement is defined as an absolute
decrease in AHI by $5 events/h (for patients with
baseline AHI #20) or an absolute decrease in AHI by
$10 events/h (for patients with baseline AHI $25).
Functional decline is defined as an absolute increase
in AHI by $5 events/h (for patients with baseline
AHI #20) or an absolute increase in AHI by $10
events/h (for patients with baseline AHI $25). See
table 2 for recommendations when the baseline AHI
is 21–24. Stable function is defined as all other re-
sponses. Table 2 outlines the amount of change in
AHI that represents response or progression based on
baseline AHI.

Special notes on AHI. AHI is a bounded variable: it is
an average number of events during an overnight
sleep study (typically 8 hours or more) and the

S16

variable ranges from 0 (no events) to .100 events/h.
The existence of upper and lower boundaries intro-
duces a ceiling and floor effect for patients with values
near the top and bottom of the range, respectively.
As table 2 shows, patients with an AHI #5/hour are
not eligible for response since these patients cannot
improve enough to meet criteria for
functional
improvement. The functional group recommends
that patients with an AHI $50/hour should not be
enrolled in clinical trials at this time given the avail-
ability of alternative treatments for very severe OSA.
Patients treated with CPAP should undergo PSG
off CPAP if they are clinically stable to do so, as
judged by their medical team. PSG on the first night
off CPAP may show milder OSA than on subsequent
nights.28–30 Because of this transient improvement,
CPAP should be discontinued for 48 hours prior to
PSG. During this time, patients should be monitored
for clinical exacerbations. The research polysomno-
gram should be discontinued for any event that the
research team considers unsafe, such as pathologic
cardiac arrhythmia during sleep other than sinus
arrhythmia.

To ensure the safety of patients during subsequent
sleep studies, the group proposes that patients who
meet the following parameters during a study should
be declared as functional decline and CPAP should
be reinstituted to meet safety needs: any condition
for which the research team considers the patient med-
ically unstable, such as treatment-emergent pathologic
cardiac arrhythmia during sleep other than sinus
arrhythmia not explained by electrolyte abnormalities.
Secondary outcomes for sleep studies. Alternative meas-
ures of sleep function are available from a standard
PSG. These measures include the change in (1) oxy-
gen saturation (SpO2) measured as mean or nadir
SpO2, or as percentage of total sleep time with
SpO2 ,90%; (2) end tidal CO2 measured as mean
or peak CO2, or as percentage of total sleep time with
CO2 .50 Torr; and (3) arousal index, defined as the
number of arousals per hour scored by EEG. While
the group committee does not endorse changes in
these variables as a primary outcome measure, we
do recommend that all of these variables, and possibly
other measures such as neurocognitive,
imaging,
patient-reported, or quality of life measures, be re-
corded as secondary outcomes to provide additional
data about the effectiveness of the intervention.

Recommended outcome for pulmonary function. For
patients in whom pulmonary function is the primary
endpoint of interest, investigators should select either os-
cillometry or spirometry as the primary measure based
on physiologic findings. In general, the functional group
endorsed the use of oscillometry for pulmonary studies
of extrathoracic/upper airway lesions and spirometry

in cystic

for pulmonary studies of intrathoracic/peripheral airway
lesions. Oscillometry has been used as a primary or sec-
ondary endpoint in studies on adenoidectomy for
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, in a prospective
trial of a multifaceted intervention to decrease asthma
onset or severity, and in a study evaluating pulmonary
fibrosis.31–33 The
exacerbation response
following measures were
considered as potential
endpoints for impulse oscillometry: R5, R10, R20,
X5, X10, X20, and changes in resistance at the resonant
frequency (table 1). The group recommended resistance
at 10 Hz (R10) as the primary outcome measure for
oscillometry. A pulmonary resistance measure (R) was
preferred over a pulmonary reactance measure (X) since
airway PNs are more likely to impact the resistance
properties
than the elastic and inertive properties
of airways. Further, R10 was selected among the
resistance measures since R10 is a better measure of
central airways compared with R5 and has been used
in more trials as an outcome measure compared to R20.
For spirometry, forced expiratory volume in 0.75
forced
seconds (FEV0.75) (in preschool children),
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (in all others),
FVC, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were consid-
ered as potential endpoints (table 1). FEV1 has been
used as a primary endpoint or secondary endpoint in
a number of clinical trials for asthma34 and cystic
fibrosis.35 The group recommended FEV0.75 for pre-
school children and FEV1 for all others as primary
outcome measure for spirometry. FEV0.75 and FEV1
were preferred since these measures reflect airway
obstruction, have low variability on repeat testing,
and are widely accepted as primary outcomes for
studies of children with airway disease.

Feasibility. Impulse oscillometry is available at many
large medical centers but is not standard at all medical
centers. Children should be instructed to breathe nor-
mally during the test and to avoid crossing the legs as
this position can contract the abdominal wall and lead
to diminished resting end-expiratory pulmonary vol-
umes. Further, the cheeks must be firmly supported
by hands to compensate for cheek compliance. In gen-
eral, a 30-second interval of testing is performed, and an
average of 3–5 measurements is obtained for analysis.
Spirometry is widely available for clinical trials. Studies
should be attended by trained personnel in order to
monitor for technical adequacy and patient compliance.
For both spirometry and impulse oscillometry, equip-
ment quality control and calibration are essential for
accurate and valid testing. The detailed parameters
and technical specifications should be performed as
described in the Standardization of Spirometry published
by the American Thoracic Society.36 Additional guide-
lines for young children are also available.37

Patient characteristics. Impulse oscillometry is com-
monly employed in children since it requires only

passive cooperation of the patient (in contrast to spi-
rometry, which requires active participation of the
patient). Standardized normative values for adults
and children down to 2 years of age have been pub-
lished.37,38 Spirometry is highly dependent on patient
cooperation and effort and can only be used in chil-
dren who are able to follow instructions reliably. In
general, spirometry can be performed in children who
are 6 years or older; however, cooperative pre-
schoolers are able to produce acceptable results.36,37
Normative values for FEV0.75 and FEV1 are available
for individuals aged 3–90 years.39–41

Response criteria. Response criteria for R10 are
defined in reference to the baseline R10 at study ini-
tiation. Functional improvement is defined as $20%
decrease in R10,
functional decline is defined as
$20% increase in R10, and stable function is defined
as all other responses. A threshold of 20% was chosen
based on data showing the average coefficient of var-
iation for resistance is #10% between tests.37

Response criteria for FEV0.75/FEV1 are defined in
reference to the baseline FEV0.75/FEV1 at study initi-
ation. Functional improvement is defined as $12%
increase in FEV0.75 (preschoolers) or in FEV1 (all
others). Functional decline is defined as $12%
decrease in FEV0.75 (preschoolers) or in FEV1 (all
others). Stable function is defined as all other responses.
The working group adopted these thresholds based on
the recommendation of the American Thoracic Soci-
ety/European Respiratory Society Task Force.42

Special notes on R10 and FEV. In clinical practice, R10
is an unbounded variable. For clinical trials, the group
recommended excluding patients with R10 #120%
predicted for age in order to allow for sufficient
improvement on clinical trial to meet response crite-
ria. No recommendation was made for a maximum
R10 value for trial participation given lack of pub-
lished data on this topic. Similarly, FEV is an
unbounded variable in clinical practice that can range
from ,10% to .100% of predicted for age, sex, and
height. For clinical trials, the group recommended
including patients with FEV0.75 or 1 $40% and
#80% of predicted for age, sex, and height in order
to allow for sufficient improvement or decline in
a clinical trial to meet response criteria.

Secondary outcomes for pulmonary function. Alternative
measures of pulmonary function are available from
oscillometry and spirometry. For oscillometry, these
measures may include change in resistance measure-
ments at 5 or 20 Hz (R5, R20), change in reactance
measurements at resonant frequency (frequency at
which reactance 5 0), and change in reactance at 5,
10, and 20 Hz. For spirometry, these measures may
include changes in FVC, PEF, and forced expiratory
flows. The committee recommends that all of these
variables, and possibly other measures
such as

imaging, patient-reported, or quality of life measures,
be recorded as secondary outcomes to provide addi-
tional data about the effectiveness of the intervention
under study.

Additional recommendations. Double baseline evaluations.
The group does not recommend the use of double
baseline studies for all clinical trials at this time, due
to the substantial resources and time required to
obtain these evaluations, and the resulting burden
to the patient. However, given the unknown variabil-
ity of the outcome measures for patients with airway
PN and the possibility of regression to the mean, the
group recommends that the baseline variability of
these measures be determined in a select group of pa-
tients to refine the proposed response criteria.

Frequency of reevaluation. No evidence-based guide-
lines are available to help determine the optimal inter-
val between evaluations. The group recommends
reevaluation of primary endpoints (AHI, R10, or
FEV0.75/FEV1) every 3–6 months during prolonged
treatment, although the group recognizes that the
timing of reevaluation may be influenced by the
design of each particular study and the agent being
tested. In general, evaluation of primary endpoints
should be performed at the same interval as imaging
studies to facilitate correlation of functional changes
with imaging changes in symptomatic PNs.

Confirmatory measurement. Confirmation of func-
tional response is desirable in nonrandomized trials
where response is the primary endpoint and in PN tri-
als where the focus is on reducing long-term morbid-
ity rather than on extending survival. In addition,
confirmation of response would increase the confi-
dence that a measured response is the result of the
intervention and not due to baseline variability. Con-
firmation of response may not be necessary for ran-
domized trials or
to
progression is the primary endpoint.

Duration of response and stable disease. The duration
of functional response is calculated from the date when
the primary endpoint first meets criteria for functional
response compared with baseline until the first date
that the primary endpoint no longer meets criteria
for functional response (table 2). Stable function is
calculated from the initiation of treatment until the
time that primary endpoint meets criteria for func-
tional decline. In order to declare stable function in
any study, testing must document stable function for
a minimum of time established by the study protocol
(generally 6 months). Patients without subsequent
evaluation after baseline evaluation should be consid-
ered nonevaluable. Importantly, estimates of duration
of response and time to progression are influenced by
the interval of evaluations. For this reason, protocols
should specify the interval between evaluations.

Proportion free from functional decline. Patients with
NF1 with growing PN involving the airway are at risk
for worsening of OSA or pulmonary function. In this
trial design, freedom from functional decline at speci-
fied time points might be an acceptable endpoint to
provide evidence of drug activity. Because freedom
from decline is liable to bias in uncontrolled phase 2 tri-
als, this variable is best evaluated by a randomized trial.
Reporting best response. For phase 2 studies, response
assessment should include all patients in the trial,
including nonevaluable patients and those whose treat-
ment deviates from the study protocol. Responses
should be categorized as functional improvement, sta-
ble function,
functional decline, or nonevaluable
(e.g., due to death, toxicity, or lack of assessment).
For phase 3 studies, functional response may be a pri-
mary or
secondary endpoint. When functional
response is the primary endpoint, the study must
include only patients who are capable of functional
improvement and all enrolled patients must be ana-
lyzed. When functional response is a secondary end-
point, the study may include patients regardless of
sleep or pulmonary function. In this design, functional
response may also be reported using a predefined sub-
group analysis (with only the patients capable of
response in the denominator). The study protocol
should include the plan to report responses, including
any subgroup analyses.

DISCUSSION These recommendations are designed
to supply investigators with a shared group of func-
tional endpoints for clinical trials of airway PN in pa-
tients with NF1. It is hoped that the use of these
endpoints will improve the ability to identify active
agents and facilitate comparison across studies with
different agents. The recommended outcomes have
not been prospectively used in NF1 PN trials to date,
and the REiNS International Collaboration expects
to revisit these recommendations as data from trials
of airway PN are published.
