Immortalization of human normal and NF1 neurofibroma
Schwann cells
Hua Li1, Lung-Ji Chang1, Debbie R Neubauer2, David F Muir2,3,4 and Margaret R Wallace1,4,5

Neurofibromas, which are benign Schwann cell tumors, are the hallmark feature in the autosomal dominant condition
neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and are associated with biallelic loss of NF1 gene function. There is a need for effective
therapies for neurofibromas, particularly the larger, plexiform neurofibromas. Tissue culture is an important tool for
research. However, it is difficult to derive enriched human Schwann cell cultures, and most enter replicative senescence
after 6–10 passages, impeding cell-based research in NF1. Through exogenous expression of human telomerase reverse
transcriptase and murine cyclin-dependent kinase (mCdk4), normal (NF1 wild-type), neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells
heterozygous for NF1 mutation, and neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells homozygous for NF1 mutation were
immortalized, including some matched samples from the same NF1 patient. Initial experiments employed retroviral
vectors, while subsequent work utilized lentiviral vectors carrying these genes because of improved efficiency. Expression
of both transgenes was required for immortalization. Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that these
cell lines are of Schwann cell lineage and have a range of phenotypes, many of which are consistent with their primary
cultures. This is the first report of immortalization and detailed characterization of multiple human NF1 normal nerve and
neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell lines, which will be highly useful research tools to study NF1 and other Schwann
tumor biology and conditions.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal domi-
nant disease (birth incidence 1/2700 (ref. 1) with half of the
patients bearing a de novo constitutional
inactivating NF1
gene mutation. The vast majority of patients develop
neurofibromas, benign Schwann cell tumors that can arise
anywhere on the peripheral nervous system and throughout
life. Adequate therapies to prevent or shrink these tumors
do not yet exist.2 Although neurofibromas on the skin are
small and mostly of cosmetic significance, those arising on
larger nerves (termed plexiform) are larger and often cause
morbidity. Plexiform neurofibromas can be fatal
they
impinge on vital structures or become malignant.3

if

It is widely accepted that neurofibroma development in
NF1 depends on a somatic NF1 mutation in a SC, rendering
the cell deficient in NF1-encoded tumor suppressor protein
neurofibromin function.4–6 Consistent with the size of the
gene and high new mutation rate, there are no recurrent NF1
germline mutations with a frequency over ~ 1–2% (except for
whole-locus ~ 1.5 Mb deletions, in ~ 7% of cases).7 Similarly,

somatic mutations are widely variable (eg, Laycock-van Spyk
et al8). Neurofibromin is known to be a key negative regulator
of RAS signaling in SC, consistent with tumor suppressor
activity, but has other (less-characterized) functions based on
various studies (reviewed by Ratner and Miller9). Although
the functional effects of NF1 mutations are actually quite
complex and heterogeneous,7 reduced neurofibromin func-
tion, due to somatic NF1 mutation combined with germline
mutation,
initiating
neurofibromas. Consistent with this, studies have generally
failed to find additional and/or consistent somatic mutations
at loci other than NF1, in neurofibroma Schwann cells, other
than some tumors containing variably-sized deletions of
chromosome 17 encompassing the non-germline-mutated
NF1 allele.10–13

is accepted as the pathogenic event

Cultivation of neurofibroma Schwann cells in the labora-
tory is important for cell, molecular and preclinical research,
particularly because there are no naturally occuring animal
models of NF1. In previous work, we and others established

Schwann cell-enriched cultures from human NF1 tumors
favor the NF1 − / − genotype.14–16
under conditions that
However, cultures derived from dermal and plexiform
neurofibromas bear some residual fibroblasts, and nearly all
enter replicative senescence, failing to divide beyond 6–9
passages. These cultures also require a prepared substratum
such as
supplementation
(eg, neuregulin 2). The lack of pure and easily cultured
human SC (wild-type and from neurofibromas) has limited
NF1 and related research. We sought to find an approach to
overcome the limitations of these cultures, to provide more
useful reagents for in vitro and in vivo studies.

There are several viruses/viral proteins that can immorta-

including Epstein Barr virus,18
SV40 T antigen,19 adenoviruses E1A and E1b,20 and human
papilloma virus 16 (E6 and E7 proteins).21 Although these
processes are relatively reliable, they work with only certain
cell types and require use of pathogenic agents. One group
reported successful
immortalization of normal human
neonatal SCs by exogenously expressing both SV40 large
T antigen and human reverse transcriptase component of
telomerase (hTERT),22 but there have not been any further
reports using this method for Schwann cells. Use of viral
proteins may result
in genetic instability or malignant
transformation. There have been reports suggesting that
exogenous expression of the reverse transcriptase component
of telomerase (TERT) alone is also capable of immortalizing
many human cell types (eg, fibroblasts, retinal pigmented
epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and mesothelial
cells), but without subsequent genetic alterations.23–25 How-
ever, several other human cell
types (eg, keratinocytes,
mammary epithelial cells, bladder urothelial cells, and pro-
static epithelial cells) transduced with TERT have subse-
quently been found to experience a telomerase-independent
growth arrest that involves the p16Ink4a/pRB pathway.26–28
Consistent with this, Darbro et al29 found hypomethylation of

somatic cells by Ramirez et al,30 through expression of murine

mediated stress response, in combination with expression of
the human telomerase catalytic subunit TERT (hTERT) to
overcome replicative senescence. That team reported success-
ful immortalization of human bronchial epithelial cells using
retroviral delivery of hTERT and mCDK4. Here we report use
of the same strategy to generate immortal cell
lines from
human normal, NF1-patient heterozygous and neurofibroma-
derived NF1 two-hit Schwann cell cultures by initially
retroviral, and subsequently lentiviral, vectors carrying the
hTERT and mCdk4 genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Schwann Cell Primary Cultures
Human normal
(wild-type), NF1 (meeting diagnostic
criteria31) neurofibroma- and non-tumor nerve-derived SCs
were isolated and cultured as previously reported16,32 with
conditions for neurofibroma cultures favoring the enrichment
of NFl − / − cells. These primary Schwann-enriched cultures
require neuregulin (glial growth factor 2), and a laminin
substratum. Pathology reports of the tumors indicated typical
neurofibromas. These primary Schwann-enriched cultures
require neuregulin (glial growth factor 2), and a laminin
substratum. Nomenclature used for cell cultures and lines:
pNF = plexiform neurofibroma SC from NF1 patient; pnNF =
peripheral nerve SC from NF1 person from non-tumor nerve
(heterozygous); pn = peripheral nerve SC from unaffected
person.

Transduction Using mCdk4 and hTERT Retroviruses
Virus-producing cells expressing the respective transgenes
PA317/hTERT and PA317/mCdk4 were kindly provided by
Dr Woodring Wright, Univ of Texas Southwestern.30 These
cells were cultured, and the virus-containing culture super-
natant (1:100) in polybrene (4 μg/ml) was used to transduce
adherent Schwann cells. pNF95.11b plexiform SC were first
transduced with retro-mCdk4 and placed under selection
(150 μg/ml G418 for 10 days), with surviving cells subse-
quently transduced with retro-hTERT-containing supernatant
(1:100) and polybrene, and subjected to selection (300 ng/ml
puromycin for 3–5 days).

Transduction by lenti-hTERT and Retro-mCdk4
Lenti-hTERT was produced by cloning the full-length human
telomerase reverse transcriptase cDNA in front of
the
elongation factor 1-a-promoter in the vector pTYcPPT,33
whereas lenti-mCdk4 was produced by cloning the murine
Cdk4 cDNA into the same vector. Separately from the retroviral
transduction mentioned above, pNF95.11b plexiform SCs were
transduced with lenti-hTERT per published protocols.34
Because there are no selectable markers in the lentiviral vector,
cells were passaged until well beyond the passage at which the
original cultures senesced (9–21 for this study), and surviving
cells were transduced with retro-mCdk4, followed by G418
selection. For this study, cells were considered immortalized if
able to be passaged more than 50 times, because (1) that was
well beyond the capacity of
the primary cultures, (2) it
suggested potentially unlimited capacity for cell division, (3) it
is consistent with the Hayflick limit of replicative senescence,17
and (4) it fulfilled our goal of creating cell lines capable of being
expanded significantly to fulfill potential needs of many
downstream users. Most cultures were not tested for cell
division beyond p50, although one (ipn02.3) was taken to p83
with no signs of replicative senescence. Cell lines were desig-
nated with an 'i' to indicate they were transduced with the
transgenes and successfully immortalized, (si to designate semi-
immortalization for pnNF95.12b, which senesced at P21).

hTERT and mCdk4 Transduction Using Only Lentivirus
Vectors
Based on improved transduction efficiency, all other SC
cultures were transduced using both lentiviruses simulta-
neously: 10 000 cells were transduced with 10–20 multiplicity
of infection of both viruses for 12 h with 10 μg/ml polybrene
in the media. Cells were maintained on laminin and neu-
regulin until passaged beyond senescence of the original
culture, and then were tested for the ability to survive and
proliferate without laminin and/or neuregulin (along with
cultures transfected with retrovirus or a combination).

Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR
RT-PCR for hTERT and mCdk4 was performed to confirm
expression of these transgenes in lenti-transduced cells, to
confirm transgene expression. Primers for mCdk4 (murine-
specific): F: 5'-CGGGACATCAAGGTCACCCTA-3', R: 5'-GA
ACAATGCAGTTTGCATGAAGA-3' (159 bp product). Pri-
mers for hTERT: F: 5'-CACTGGCTGATGAGTGTGTAC-3',
R: 5'-TTCACCCTCGAGGTGAGACGCT-3' (320 bp product).
GAPDH: F: 5'-TCATCATCTCTGCCCCCTCTG-3', R: 5'-GC
CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3' (439 bp). Telomerase is not
expressed at RT-PCR detectable levels in unmodified cultured
Schwann cells (Techangamsuwan et al35 and this report), so
any expression was deemed transgene-related. In addition,
RT-PCR was done to examine the NF1 transcript for inclusion
of the 63 bp alternative exon '23a' (traditional number in
earlier literature, corresponds to number 31 in NG_009018.1)
by PCR across this cDNA region using primers 5'-TCAACT
TCGAAGTGTGTGCCAGTG-3' (XU7) and 5'-CACCATTGAT
followed by electro-
TTGACCAGTTTTG-3' (PTTS3-28R),
phoresis on a native polyacrylamide gel
for ethidium-
bromide visualization of relative amounts of transcript with
(type II) and without exon 23a (type I).

NF1 Mutation Analyses
To assess the purity of the immortalized cultures, DNA
analysis of the NF1 gene was performed to confirm the
presence of the germline and somatic mutations in all but the
wild-type lines (from normal human nerves). This was a two-
part approach, the first based on established methods for PCR
amplification of NF1 exons36 or cDNA fragments37 followed
by mutation-specific restriction digest/polyacrylamide elec-
trophoresis or by sequencing of the PCR products (BigDye 3.0
kit, Applied Biosystems/LifeTechnologies,
Foster City,
CA, USA). Sequence data were analyzed with Sequencher
software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The second
approach yielded the remaining mutations through high-
throughput DNA sequencing strategies applied to the primary
SC cultures.13

Karyotype
The Oregon Health Sciences University Cytogenetics labora-
tory provided standard G-banded karyotypes on the cell lines,
characterizing 20 cells when possible. In brief, cells were

harvested after 4 h of colcemid treatment
metaphase,
incubated in a hypotonic solution (0.075 M
KCL, 5% fetal bovine serum) for 10 min, then fixed in 3:1
methanol:acetic acid. The cell suspension was dropped onto
alcohol-cleaned microscope slides which were then baked at
90 °C for 20 min. After cooling, the slides were trypsinized for
45 s, stained with Wright stain for 80 s, rinsed with distilled
water and dried. Chromosomes were imaged using bright
field microscopy and analyzed using Cytovision software
(Applied Imaging, San Jose, CA, USA).

Cell Authentication
Single-cell authentication was performed on select lines by the
Genetic Resources Core Facility at
the Johns Hopkins
University, using STR genotype profiling of immortalized
cells and corresponding primary cultures (PowerPlex 18D
system from Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

Contact Inhibition
Normal SC are contact inhibited in culture, meaning that they
form a monolayer and stop dividing at confluence. In this
assay, cells were plated as usual, such that the next day (day 1)
had a density of 30–50%. Each day for 5 days, photographs
were taken to document the increasing density, morphology,
and whether the cells were showing the ability to grow on top
of each other (cell bodies, not just processes). The immor-
talized cultures were evaluated for whether, at confluence, the
cells continued to divide and piled on top of each other,
features of
transformed cells. The latter phenotype was
defined as lack of contact inhibition.

Immunocytochemistry for S100B and Proliferation Rate
Immunocytochemistry was performed in eight-well chamber
slides to stain cells for the SC marker S100B, and for BrdU
incorporation to measure proliferation rate, using methods
we reported previously and are briefly outlined here.16 For
proliferation, cultures were assayed at passages where they
showed optimal expansion, with the assay beginning at 50%
confluence. BrdU was added for 16 h, following by fixation
and immunostaining with anti-BrdU. The percentage of
positive nuclei out of total nuclei in three different fields was
calculated. S100B-positive cells were counted in triplicate
(three fields) and averaged. To more simply represent the
level of staining, a 1–4 scale based on relative S100B positivity
was used for consistency with our publication describing
several of the primary cultures, with '4' representing the most
heavily immunopositive.16 These data are reported in Table 1.

Doubling Time Assay
For each cell line, 104, 3 × 104, and 105 cells were seeded
into 12-well tissue culture plates. At each of six time points
(24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h) viable cells in duplicate wells
were counted (trypan blue/hemacytometer). Doubling times
were calculated from these counts using the online program
at www.doublingtime.com.

Immortal NF1 and normal Schwann cells
H Li et al

Soft Agar Assay
This measure of
tumorigenicity (anchorage-independent
growth) was performed as we described previously, using
the glioblastoma cell line T98G as positive control.16

TUNEL Staining For Apoptosis
Apoptotic index of each cell line was determined using the
Promega DeadEnd TUNEL system according to the manu-
facturer's instructions (Promega).

Microsatellite Instability
D5S346, D17S250, and BAT26, three established NCI micro-
satellite instability markers,38 were genotyped using standard
PCR conditions (HotStar Taq polymerase, Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA)
followed by 15% native polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis to screen for de novo alleles in the cells' DNA
compared with that of primary cultures or germline DNA.
BAT26 PCR primers were redesigned to create a smaller
amplimer (155 bp) for better gel resolution of individual alleles:
5'-GACTACTTTTGACTTCAGCCAGTA-3' and 5'-GCTTCTT
CAGTATATGTCAATGAAAAC-3'. Further, one of the cell
authentication markers used (PENTAD) also provided insight
about microsatellite instability.

Xenografts
Taking advantage of occasional opportunities for a pilot test
of tumorigenicity in vivo, we were able to test six cell lines by
xenograft, placed subcutaneously or intraneurally into NOD-
scid-IL2Rγ mice (Jackson Laboratories #005557, Bar Harbor,
Maine, USA) as we described previously,16 to detect whether
visible tumors developed or not (microscopic analysis was
not undertaken). In our experience, primary neurofibroma-
derived SC do not
form subcutaneous masses. When
xenografted into nerve, neurofibroma-derived SC usually
survive and may proliferate, but do not tend to form a visible
tumor mass (or they are small), unlike many cell lines derived
from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) that
create large tumors.16,39–41

Results
Primary Schwann cell cultures established from patient
surgical donations were the primary material for this work.
This included three cultures from non-tumor nerve of
subjects with NF1, leading to matched heterozygous SC lines
for two of the subjects whose NF1-null Schwann cells also
immortalized (ipNF95.11b C and ipnNF95.11c; ipNF05.5 and
ipnNF09.4). No primary cultures divided beyond p21, and
most senesced in less than 10 population doublings.16

In the initial experiments transducing several cultures with
retroviral vectors containing hTERT and mCdk4, the vast
majority of cells died during selection,
indicating a poor
transduction rate. Only one cell line resulted from retroviral
transduction of plexiform neurofibroma-derived SC culture
pNF95.11b: immortalized culture ipNF95.11b 'C' (via retro-
mCdk4 first followed by retro-hTERT infection). We then

tried transduction of a SC culture using a lentivirus carrying
only the GFP gene as a label, and found 80% transduction
efficiency (data not shown), leading to subsequent choice to
use lentiviral vectors for all remaining immortalizations.
During the transition, however, pNF95.11b immortalized cell
line 'C/T' was also produced, by lenti-hTERT transduction
(at p8) followed by retro-mCdk4 (at p20). Table 1 lists the
immortalized lines and specific properties, including compar-
ison with properties of the corresponding primary cultures.

did not produce any immortalized SC lines except a hTERT-
only culture (hTERT-pn02.3), which expanded up to p38
before it stopped proliferating. The observation that SC
required both transgenes for immortalization is consistent
with literature indicating that some normal cell types require
both proteins (hTERT and mCdk4) to overcome replicative
senescence in culture.30 We have not tested expansion beyond
line ipn02.3 2λ,
p50 except for the normal Schwann cell
which has divided to p83 with no signs of senescence, and
has been utilized in studies by a number of other
laboratories.42–46 The cultures were each immortalized as a
population and studied as such, although we wanted to test
whether single-cell cloning was possible. We were able to
derive at least a few single-cell clones from the cell
lines
tested: ipNF05.5, ipNF95.6, ipNF04.4, and ipn02.3 2λ. As a
side experiment, six individual clones (NF1-null) that were
cloned at passage 11 from ipNF05.5 were combined at passage
16 to compare to the original immortalized ipNF05.5. It was
reassuring that both the population and mixed clones showed
similar properties for most of the features in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S2, and also yielded similar results in a
primary screen against a small drug library.47

For simultaneous double lentiviral transduction, cultures
divided beyond p50, except that ipnNF09.4 was only taken to
p47, but did not show signs of senscence at that point, and
sipnNF95.12B which sensesced at P21. Cell authentication
genotyping confirmed that the immortalized lines derived
from their corresponding primary cultures (STR genotypes
listed in Supplementary Table S1). All of the immortalized
lines became laminin- and neuregulin-independent except for
ipNF00.6, although two lines (ipNF05.5 and the six-clone mix
of ipNF05.5) grew more robustly with both.

As shown in Figure 1a,

the two lines derived from
pNF95.11b appear to be pure or nearly pure two-hit cells,
showing loss of heterozygosity with no evidence of
the
normal allele. DNA sequencing of ipNF95.6 showed that the
somatic NF1 mutation (nonsense R2237X) is present in equal
quantities with the germline allele (a nonsense mutation at
another site, but wild type at the somatic mutation base)
(Figure 1b), consistent with the majority of cells containing
both the germline and somatic mutation, despite lack of
S100B expression. This supports the conclusion that this line
represents relatively pure immortalized 'two-hit' tumor SC
rather than heterozygous cells. Four such plexiform cell lines
were generated with both germline and somatic mutations

confirmed (Table 1); in three others (ipNF06.2A, ipNF00.6,
ipNF03.3) the somatic mutation was not identified despite in-
depth screening, so it is likely that these represent hetero-
zygous SC that were by chance immortalized rather than the
two-hit SC (or, the somatic mutation may be present, but
such cells are at extremely low frequency). In the three

In further genetics experiments, semi-
quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the NF1 type II alternatively
spliced transcripts showed that at least half of
the NF1
transcripts in the immortalized cell lines represented the type
II isoform that includes exon '23a' (Figure 2a). This isoform is
associated with reduced RAS GTPase-activating (GAP)
activity, thus greater active RAS-GTP signaling.48–49 Some
cell lines were closer to half type I and half type II, including
the normal SC lines. Normal adult tissues typically show more

lines,

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR data verified expression of both
transgenes in all cell
including at multiple passage
numbers (Figure 2). Vector copy number of one line
(ipNF00.6) that slowed in proliferation rate at p27 was
checked; that line had four lentiviral copies present and with
relatively equal expression both at p8 and p27 (data not
shown). Thus, the transgenes appear to be stably integrated
and active in these lines, consistent with established lentivirus
biology.

Most cell

lines had at least some cells immunopositive
for the Schwann cell marker S100B (Table 1, scores 1–3),
consistent with being of Schwann lineage. This was true even
for the cell
lines whose morphology had gained some
polygonal (epithelial-like) or fibroblastic morphology,
in
addition to spindle-like (typical of SC), where cells of
different morphology stained similarly for S100B (Table 1).
Most of the immortal lines were equally or somewhat less
immunopositive for S100B compared with original untrans-
illustrated in Figure 3 (pNF95.6 vs
fected cultures as
ipNF95.6, pNF95.11b vs
ipNF95.11b showing similarity),
regardless of apparent high purity of homozygous mutant
cells. Among the minority showing less similarity were two
lines that lost S100B staining relative to
heterozygous cell
primary culture, and in addition,
ipNF03.3 and ipNF04.4
became fully S100B-positive after immortalization. Thus,
while generally consistent relative to primary culture, the
S100B phenotype was seen to vary as a result of
the
immortalization process,
regardless of cell morphology
change. Therefore, the S100B phenotype is not a robust
marker for whether immortalized lines are of Schwann origin;
instead, molecular work demonstrating that tumor-derived
immortalized cells carry NF1 germline and somatic mutations
is a better measure of whether such lines truly derive from the
original tumor SC.

possible that cytogenetic abnormalities may arise as random

primary normal nerve and plexiform SC cultures do not
proliferate in the subcutaneous environment, but can survive
and proliferate to a minor degree in the sciatic nerve,
although not always producing outright visible enlargement
of the sciatic nerve.16,39 None of the immortalized cell lines

the end result in terms of tumorigenic phenotypes from this

Discussion
This work shows that human Schwann cells, including those
from neurofibromas, can be immortalized by exogenous
expression of Cdk4 and telomerase. This addresses a need in
the biomedical research community both by indicating a way
to create immortalized human Schwann cells, and by creating
these characterized cells as research resources. The advantages
of the immortalized cells compared with primary cultures
include increased purity, much greater expansion capacity,
and reduced need for special culture conditions. The trade-off
is that the cells have gained the tumorigenic property of
immortalization, with variable additional transformed pheno-
types such as anchorage independence (in four lines, although
the degree of colony formation was much less than the positive

control, glioblastoma line T98G). We also observed that the
process led to aneuploidy in some lines, which is unpredictable
in its occurrence and effect, but immortalization with Cdk4
likely sets up a susceptibility for such events by affecting cell
cycle. An established phenomenon in neurofibroma-derived
two-hit enriched SC cultures is atypical morphology and
variable staining with S100B,16 and this was also observed with
some of the immortalized cell lines. Not unexpectedly, there
was heterogeneity for nearly all features measured in the
immortalized cells, with little in the way of patterns (eg, some
lost contact
inhibition and anchorage dependence, while
others had only one or none of these features, and which did
not correlate with presence of aneuploidy or other properties,
or being wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous mutant at
NF1). For four neurofibroma-derived SC lines (ipNF95.11b,
ipNF95.6, ipNF05.5, and ipNF04.4), genetics showed that that
regardless of morphology and S100B expression, these lines
are derived from the original two-hit SC. Although a normal
somatic allele was not observed, we cannot rule out presence
of underlying immortalized fibroblasts or heterozygous SC
(estimating o5% if present). The ability to isolate single-cell
clones enables study of such. On the other hand, study of a
clone might yield results less representative of the tumor SC
line as a whole.

This work is also the first to produce immortalized SC line
pairs from normal nerve and plexiform neurofibroma from
the same patients, which may be of utility in experiments
where isogenic background is helpful: ipNF95.11b (C and C/T)
with ipnNF95.11C; ipNF05.5 with ipnNF09.4.

Because they are purer than primary cells, and can expand
many more passages, these immortalized SC cell lines can be
useful for basic biology/neuroscience investigations (wild-
type, heterozygous), tumor investigations (NF1-null cells),
genetic manipulation to create new models or for rescue
experiments, or preclinical studies such as use in xenograft as
we demonstrated. For example, these cells were recently used

in a high-throughput drug library,47 and in one study the
wild-type ipn02.3 cell line was modified to knockdown the
NF2 gene by siRNA lentivirus transduction.46 The availability

Production of cell lines from different patients and tumors
