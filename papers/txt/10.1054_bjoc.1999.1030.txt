Neurofibromatosis 2, radiosurgery and malignant
nervous system tumours

Sir
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare (1:40 000) autosomal domi-
nant  disease  that  is  caused  by  mutations  of  the  NF2 tumour
suppressor gene. NF2 is characterized by benign nervous system
tumours  such  as  vestibular  schwannomas  (VSs),  intracranial
meningiomas  and  spinal  tumours.  Kondziolka  et  al  (1998)
reported the outcomes of radiosurgery for unilateral sporadic VSs,
but NF2 patients were excluded and follow-up was limited. The
consequences  of  radiosurgery  for  histologically  benign  NF2
tumours  merit  study  due  to  the  mutagenic  potential  of  ionizing
radiation. Somatic mutation could contribute to the transformation
or  acceleration  of  existing  tumours,  and  to  the  development  of
secondary  tumours,  because  NF2  patients  have  an  inactivated
germ-line  NF2 allele.  Ionizing  radiation  is  known  to  have  such
effects  in  hereditary  retinoblastoma  (Wong  et  al,  1997).  We
conducted  this  study  because  the  prevalence  of,  and  risk  factors
for, malignant nervous system tumours in NF2 are unknown.

We  surveyed  genetics,  otolaryngology  and  neurology/neuro-
surgery centres in North America and Europe with a total of 1348
NF2 patients. There were nine malignant nervous system tumours
in  the  estimated  1242  NF2  patients  who  did  not  have  previous
radiosurgery.  This  prevalence  of  725  per  105 (95%  confidence
interval  (CI)  253–1197  per  105)  is  significantly  greater  than  the
population prevalence of 1.13 per 105 (95% CI 1.09–1.15 per 105)
(SEER  Program  Public-Use  CD-ROM,  1998).  There  were  five
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), two malig-
nant  meningiomas,  one  malignant  ependymoma  and  one
anaplastic astrocytoma (median age at tumour diagnosis, 14 years;
range 7–35 years). The population prevalences of these tumours
are  MPNST,  0.00  per  105;  malignant  meningioma,  0.42  per  105;
malignant ependymoma, 0.05 per 105; and anaplastic astrocytoma,
0.66 per 105 (SEER Program Public-Use CD-ROM, 1998). Thus,
NF2 patients have a significantly increased prevalence of MPNST
(402 per 105; 95% CI 50–754 per 105).

After radiosurgery for benign tumours, five NF2 patients devel-
oped malignant tumours in high-dose areas (three MPNSTs, one
malignant meningioma and one malignant ependymoma; median
age  at  tumour  diagnosis,  32  years).  In  three  large  NF2  patient
series that were included in this study, 47 of 599 patients (7.8%)

received  radiosurgery  (DGR  Evans  et  al,  unpublished  data).  By
extrapolation, about 106 of the 1348 patients in this study would
have received radiosurgery, suggesting that malignant transforma-
tion in five of 106 patients was radiation-associated (4717 per 105;
95% CI 681–8753 per 105).

Radiosurgery is typically used for NF2 patients with aggressive
tumours, or who refuse surgery, or who are poor surgical risks or
elderly.  The  results  of  this  study  should  not  be  used  to  interdict
radiosurgery for these patients; in addition, the results of this study
reflect  past  exposures  and  lower  doses  of  ionizing  radiation  are
used  in  current  radiosurgery  protocols.  However,  observation
without  surgery,  decompression  without  tumour  removal,  and
surgical excision are the preferred therapies for other NF2 patients,
particularly those who are young.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We  thank  the  NF2  patients  for  their  participation  and  Dr  JM
Friedman for many helpful comments.
