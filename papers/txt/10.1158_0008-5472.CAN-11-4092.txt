Abstract

The genetic evolution from a benign neuroﬁbroma to a malignant sarcoma in patients with neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 (NF1) syndrome remains unclear. Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be the primary
pathogenic cell in neuroﬁbromas because they harbor biallelic neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1) gene mutations. However,
the phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (Nf1) genes recently were found to be
comutated in high-grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) in mice. In this study, we created transgenic
mice that lack both Pten and Nf1 in Schwann cells and Schwann cell precursor cells to validate the role of these two
genes in PNST formation in vivo. Haploinsufﬁciency or complete loss of Pten dramatically accelerated
neuroﬁbroma development and led to the development of higher grade PNSTs in the context of Nf1 loss. Pten
dosage, together with Nf1 loss, was sufﬁcient for the progression from low-grade to high-grade PNSTs. Genetic
analysis of human malignant PNSTs (MPNST) also revealed downregulation of PTEN expression, suggesting that
Pten-regulated pathways are major tumor-suppressive barriers to neuroﬁbroma progression. Together, our
ﬁndings establish a novel mouse model that can rapidly recapitulate the onset of human neuroﬁbroma
tumorigenesis and the progression to MPNSTs. Cancer Res; 72(13); 3405–13. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is an autosomal
dominant inherited disease in which a majority of patients
develop benign plexiform and/or dermal neuroﬁbromas. Of
great concern is that approximately 10% of NF1 patients
develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST),
which often develop from plexiform neuroﬁbromas and have a
poor prognosis (1–3). Schwann cells are believed to be the
primary pathogenic cell source in neuroﬁbromas because they

show biallelic neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1) gene mutations (4–6). In
addition to NF1 mutations, MPNSTs harbor many secondary
genetic changes and many of these underlying genetic mechan-
isms are still unknown (7).

Our laboratory and others have successfully shown the
effectiveness of the conditional Sleeping Beauty (SB) transpo-
son system as a forward genetic insertional mutagenesis screen
in mice for cancer candidate genes (8–10). Using this SB system
in a similar forward genetic screen to elucidate candidate
genes responsible for sporadic MPNST formation, we directed
SB insertional mutagenesis speciﬁcally in genetically predis-
posed Schwann cells and were successful in generating many
tumors. We identiﬁed many candidate mutational drivers of
higher grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) by iden-
tifying commonly mutated genetic loci using the transposon as
a molecular tag (manuscript in preparation). Importantly,
phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and neuroﬁbromatosis 1
(Nf1) genes were among the many candidate genes identiﬁed in
this screen that tended to be comutated in the same high-grade
PNSTs (P < 7.94e–5). Inactivation of the Nf1 gene by the desert
hedgehog (Dhh) promoter driving Cre recombinase (Dhh-Cre)
at embryonic age 12.5 elicits plexiform neuroﬁbromas, dermal
neuroﬁbromas, and abnormal hyperpigmentation (11). PTEN,
a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway involved
in regulation of cell growth and survival, is the most frequently
inactivated tumor suppressor gene in sporadic cancer (12).
Pten dosage is essential for neuroﬁbroma development and

malignant transformation in the context of Kras activation
(13). However, the relationship between Pten and Nf1 in
Schwann cell neuroﬁbroma development and its progression
to aggressive genetically engineered mouse model-PNST has
not been elucidated. To further understand the underlying
genetic complexity of plexiform neuroﬁbroma and MPNST
development, we hypothesized that somatic Nf1 and Pten
inactivation in Schwann cells and/or their precursors will
promote progressive low-grade and/or high-grade PNST for-
mation. Dhh-Cre was used to elicit recombination of Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
(14) and Ptenﬂox/ﬂox (15) alleles, allowing for inactivation of both
Nf1 and Pten genes in Schwann cells and/or their precursors.
Knowing that Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox (DNf1) animals develop low-
grade PNSTs, we hypothesized that triple transgenic mice Dhh-
Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox; Ptenﬂox/ﬂox (DNf1/DPten) could develop low-
grade tumors that would further progress to high-grade PNSTs.
In this study, our data strongly implicates the synergistic role
of Pten inactivation to plexiform neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis
and progression to high-grade PNSTs in the context of Nf1 loss
in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells. Importantly,
expression microarray analyses of bulk tumor and cell lines
from human NF1 patients also show a selective pressure
towards loss of PTEN expression during disease progression
from a benign neuroﬁbroma to a malignant tumor. This novel
mouse model can be used to rapidly model the onset of low-
grade PNST development and its progression to high-grade
PNSTs. In addition, this model can be used to test a variety of
pharmaceutical agents in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Generation of transgenic animals

Generation of transgenic mice carrying the Dhh gene reg-
ulatory element driving Cre recombinase (Dhh-Cre) has been
previously described (ref. 16; Supplementary Fig. S1). Trans-
genic mice carrying the ﬂoxed Nf1 allele that has the essential
exons 31 and 32 of the Nf1 gene ﬂoxed with loxP sites has been
previously described (ref. 14; Supplementary Fig. S1). The
ﬂoxed Pten allele consists of the essential exons 4 and 5 of
the Pten gene ﬂoxed with loxP sites has been previously
described (ref. 15; Supplementary Fig. S1). These singly trans-
genic mice were crossed to obtain triple transgenic mice
containing one allele of each transgene. These triple transgenic
mice were then interbred to obtain various experimental and
control cohorts (Fig. 1A). Animals were sacriﬁced when mor-
ibund because of paralysis and necropsy done. All animal work
was conducted according to the University of Minnesota's
approved animal welfare protocol.

PCR genotyping

Identiﬁcation of the various genotypes from both adult
transgenic animal and pups were carried out as follows: Firstly,
genomic DNA was isolated from tail clippings using standard
proteinase K treatment, phenol–chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. Genomic DNA was then dissolved in
sterile TE [10 mmol/L tris-HCl (pH7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8)]
and quantiﬁed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. PCR
genotyping was done using 50 ng of diluted genomic DNA as
template in a 25 mL PCR reaction volume. PCR primers used for

when necessary. Trigeminal nerves attached to the brain were
also observed for any abnormalities. The number of enlarged
dorsal root ganglia was counted for the whole spinal cord. All
reasonably sized tumor nodules (>1 mm in diameter) were
carefully removed from the spinal cord using ﬁne forceps and
placed in fresh cold PBS.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining

Sections for histology were only taken from larger tumor
nodules (>1 mm in diameter). Tissues were ﬁxed in 10%
formalin, routinely processed and embedded in parafﬁn. Sec-
tions for histology were cut at 5 microns from the parafﬁn
blocks using a standard microtome (Leica), mounted and heat
ﬁxed onto glass slides. Slides were either stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols, or used for
immunoﬂuorescence, immunohistochemistry, and/or tolui-
dine blue (TB) staining as described in the next section.

Immunohistochemistry, toluidine blue, and
immunoﬂuorescence staining



Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections from various
tissues were sectioned at 5 microns, mounted and heat-ﬁxed
onto glass slides to be used for imunohistochemical analyses.
Brieﬂy, the glass section slides were dewaxed and rehydrated
through a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration. The
antigen epitopes on the tissue sections were then unmasked
using a commercially available unmasking solution (Vector
Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The tissue section slides were then treated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide to remove any endogenous peroxidases. Blocking was
carried out at 4
C using a M.O.M. mouse immunoglobulin-
blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) or in appropriate nor-
mal serum from the host of the secondary antibody (5% serum
in PBS) in a humidiﬁed chamber for several hours. For immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC) and/or immunoﬂuorescence, sec-
tions were then incubated overnight at 4
C in a humidiﬁed
chamber using various primary antibodies at the indicated
dilutions: Ki67 (1:200; Novocastra), S100b (1:100; Santa Cruz),
Pten (1:200; Cell Signaling), phospho-Erk1/2 (1:400; Cell Sig-
naling), phospho-Akt (Ser473; D9E; 1:250; Cell Signaling), Olig2
(1:200; Abcam) and phospho-S6 (Ser240/244; 1:200; Cell Sig-
naling). After primary incubation, sections were washed thor-
oughly in PBS before incubating with horseradish peroxidase
secondary antibody raised against the primary antibody ini-
tially used. After thorough washes with PBS, the sections were
treated with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Vector Labora-
tories) and allowed for adequate signal to develop before
stopping the reaction in water. Finally, sections were then
lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through
gradual increase in ethanol concentration, cleared in Citrosol,
and mounted in Permount (Fisher).



TB staining for mast cells were carried out using standard
protocols: Brieﬂy, sections were dewaxed and rehydrated to
water, stained with TB working solution (0.1% toluidine blue
O in 0.9% sodium chloride pH 2.3) for 2 to 3 minutes, washed
3 times with distilled water before dehydrating quickly
through a series of alcohols, clearing in Citrosol and ﬁnally
mounted in Permount.

Role of PTEN and NF1 in Schwann Cell Tumorigenesis

Immunoﬂuorescence was carried out on formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded sections using standard techniques. Brief-
ly, sections were processed as described previously for IHC up
to the primary antibody incubation step. Sections were then
incubated in ﬂuorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen) before mounting in Prolong Gold Antifade
Reagent (Invitrogen). Sections were examined using appropri-
ate excitation wavelength.

Histologic evaluation

Sections stained with H&E, antibodies to Ki67 and S100b
antigens, and with TB were evaluated for all tumors (17). Each
sample was graded using established criteria for tumors arising
in genetically engineered mice (18, 19). Brieﬂy,
low-grade
PNSTs exhibited low cellularity with little if any nuclear atypia
and mitotic activity. High-grade PNSTs were increasingly
cellular with increasing nuclear atypia and increasing mitotic
activity.

Microarray gene expression

Microarray gene expression analysis was done on puriﬁed
human Schwann cells taken from normal sciatic nerve, dermal
and plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and MPNST cell lines as previ-
ously described (20, 21). Microarray gene expression analysis
was also carried out on normal sciatic nerve tissue, dermal
neuroﬁbroma, plexiform neuroﬁbroma, and malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath solid tumor samples obtained from NF1
patients as previously described (20, 21).

Comparison of mouse model with human NF1 patients
MRI images of different neuroﬁbromas were taken from NF1
patients at the University of Minnesota (IRB study number
1103E97613).

Results
Early postnatal lethality results from Nf1 and Pten
inactivation in Schwann cells and/or their precursor
cells

Transgenes used to generate the peripheral nerve tumor
progression mouse model are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Transgenic mice carrying all 3 transgenes [Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/þ
;
Ptenﬂox/þ
(Nf1-het/Pten-het)] were interbred to generate both
experimental and control cohorts (Fig. 1A). Signiﬁcant differ-
ences in survival rate were observed between (i) Dhh-Cre;
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox; Ptenﬂox/ﬂox (DNf1/DPten) and Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Ptenﬂox/þ
(DNf1/Pten-het; P < 0.0001, log-rank test) and (ii)
DNf1/Pten-het compared with Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox (DNf1; P ¼
0.0006, log-rank test), indicating Pten dosage in the context of
Nf1 inactivation plays an important role for disease progres-
sion (Fig. 1B).
In addition, signiﬁcant differences in survival rate were also
observed between (i) DNf1/DPten and Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/þ
; Pten-
ﬂox/ﬂox (Nf1-het/DPten; P < 0.0001, log-rank test) and (ii) DNf1/
DPten and Dhh-Cre; Ptenﬂox/ﬂox (DPten; P ¼ 0.0001, log-rank
test; Fig. 1B). Complete inactivation of Pten in Schwann cells
and/or their precursor cells alone can also contribute to
enlarged dorsal root ganglia but at a lower penetrance (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2). Although there was a statistical difference

in the survival rate between DPten and Nf1-het/DPten cohorts
(P¼ 0.0419, log-rank test), the occurrence of various peripheral
nervous system phenotypes was comparable (Table 1). The
median survival age for experimental and control cohorts are
shown in Table 1. Experimental and control mice became
moribund because of paralysis as the result of various periph-
eral nervous system tumor burden. In contrast, Nf1-het/Pten-
het control mice (n ¼ 8) displayed no obvious phenotype and
were viable up to 365 days or more. Several Nf1-het/Pten-het
control mice were sacriﬁced at various ages (from 189–506
days) and all peripheral nerves were normal (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

There was also no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
survival rate between experimental cohorts DNf1/Pten-het and
Nf1-het/DPten (P ¼ 0.7911, log-rank test). Others and we have
shown that DNf1 mice have a median survival age of about 243
days (n ¼ 11) (11). There was no statistical difference in the
survival rate between DPten and DNf1 (P ¼ 0.3660, log-rank
test), indicating that loss of either tumor suppressor gene can
promote Schwann cell tumorigenesis. Biallelic inactivation of
Nf1 and Pten in Schwann cells led to rapid postnatal death,
resulting in a median survival age of 15 days (Fig. 1B). Increas-
ing levels of Pten partially alleviated the severe phenotype,
leading to an increase in survival (Fig. 1B). Complete Nf1 loss is
essential for the rapid severe peripheral nervous system phe-
notype in the context of Pten inactivation in Schwann cells
and/or their precursor cells (Fig. 1B).

Severe peripheral nervous system phenotype observed in
DNf1/DPten animals

DNf1/DPten experimental animals displayed a severe early
peripheral nervous system phenotype that included enlarged
brachial plexi, multiple enlarged dorsal root ganglia, and
enlarged trigeminal nerves (Fig. 2A, left). In contrast, DNf1/
Pten-het animals displayed a similar peripheral nervous system
phenotype including enlarged brachial plexi, several
large
dorsal root ganglia, and enlarged trigeminal nerves but at a
delayed latency (median age of 172 days) and at a signiﬁcantly

reduced tumor multiplicity (Fig. 2A, middle and Fig. 2B). DNf1
animals displayed a similar peripheral nervous system pheno-
type and at a similar tumor multiplicity but with a more
delayed latency (median age of 243 days) compared with
DNf1/Pten-het animals (Fig. 2A, right). Both DNf1/Pten-het and
DNf1 animals had enlarged brachial plexi, several large dorsal
root ganglia, and enlarged trigeminal nerves (Fig. 2A, middle
and right, respectively). Importantly, Pten dosage with Nf1
inactivation affected enlarged dorsal root ganglia tumor mul-
tiplicity between DNf1/DPten and DNf1/Pten-het animals.
DNf1/DPten animals had signiﬁcantly more enlarged dorsal
root ganglia, compared with DNf1/Pten-het animals (P < 0.0001,
unpaired t test; Fig. 2B and Table 1). Pten loss contributed to
enlarged dorsal root ganglion formation as seen in Nf1-het/
DPten and DPten animals. The median survival age and num-
ber of enlarged dorsal root ganglia from Nf1-het/DPten and
DPten animals were shown in Supplementary Fig. S2
and Table 1. Both Nf1-het/DPten and DPten animals had an
increased incidence of enlarged brachial plexi and trigem-
inal nerves (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table 1). Enlarged
peripheral nerves from Nf1-het/DPten and DPten animals
were graded as low-grade PNSTs, whereas enlarged periph-
eral nerves from DNf1/DPten experimental animals were
graded as high-grade PNSTs by histology and Ki67 staining
criteria as depicted (refs. 18, 19; Table 1). DNf1/DPten
experimental animals had enlarged brachial plexi and tri-
geminal nerves at 100% occurrence (n ¼ 11), whereas DNf1/
Pten-het animals had enlarged brachial plexi and trigeminal
nerves at 92.3% and 69.2% occurrence (n ¼ 13), respectively
(Table 1). Occurrence of other peripheral nerve phenotype
seen in DNf1/DPten experimental animals (n ¼ 11) included
enlarged lumbar sacral plexi (54.5%) and enlarged sciatic
nerves (63.6%; Table 1). It seems that Pten inactivation was
required for lumbar plexi tumorigenesis, and that a dose-
dependent effect exists as more tumors were found in
animals with both alleles inactivated compared with ani-
mals with one allele inactivated. As for DNf1/Pten-het ani-
mals (n ¼ 13), occurrence of enlarged lumbar sacral plexi

Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses
revealed mice developed low-grade and high-grade
PNSTs

Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses of
peripheral nervous system tissues taken from both experimen-
tal cohorts showed high-grade PNSTs in DNf1/DPten animals
(Fig. 4A) compared with low-grade PNSTs seen in DNf1/Pten-
het animals (Fig. 4B). Enlarged peripheral nervous system
tissues taken from DPten and Nf1-het/DPten animals were
generally low-grade PNSTs. Importantly, enlarged peripheral
nerves taken from representative DNf1/DPten and DNf1/Pten-
het animals were positive for S100b and Olig2 staining, indi-
cating a Schwann cell and/or precursor cell origin (Fig. 4A and
B). These cells were also Ki67-positive at varying intensities
indicative of cell proliferation (Fig. 4A and B). Enlarged periph-
eral nerves taken from DNf1/DPten and DNf1/Pten-het animals
were both pErk1/2 positive by IHC; levels were higher than
detected in normal nerves (Supplementary Fig. S3), thus con-
ﬁrming that the conditional inactivation of Nf1 in Schwann
cells and/or their precursor cells resulted in activated Ras/
Mapk/Erk signaling (Fig. 4A and B). Enlarged peripheral nerves
taken from DNf1/DPten animals were also pAkt positive by IHC;
levels were higher than detected in normal nerves (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3), thus conﬁrming the conditional inactivation
of Pten in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells results in
activated Pi3k/Akt/mTor signaling (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Nf1-het/
DPten animals were also pAkt positive by IHC (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In contrast, DNf1/Pten-het animals were slightly pos-
itive for pAkt likely reﬂecting partial inactivation of Pten in
Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells (Fig. 4B). Both DNf1/
DPten and DNf1/Pten-het animals were positive for pS6, a
downstream effector gene and indicator for Akt/mTor activa-
tion (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, the wild-type Pten allele in
DNf1/Pten-het animals seemed to be intact, as peripheral
nerves stained positive for Pten by immunoﬂuorescence (Fig
4C). Semiquantitative analysis for Ki67-positive cells was car-
ried out on representative peripheral nerves taken from control
and experimental cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S4). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in number of Ki67-positive cells in
cohorts with low-grade PNSTs (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig.
S4). However, signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.01) were seen in the
number of Ki67-positive cells in DNf1/DPten animals with high-
grade PNSTs when compared with other cohorts (Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S4).

Microarray gene expression analysis of human
peripheral nerve tumor samples

Both PTEN and NF1 levels in puriﬁed Schwann cells taken
from human peripheral nerve, neuroﬁbroma, and MPNST cell
lines (Fig. 5A) and solid tumors (Fig. 5B) at various stages of
disease were analyzed by microarray gene expression analysis.
As expected in NF1 patients, NF1 expression levels were
reduced in the majority of samples tested (Fig. 5A and B).
Although there may be a trend to reduced PTEN expression
levels at early stages of the disease, there was a dramatic
decrease in its expression level in the malignant stage of the
disease (Fig. 5A and B).

Discussion

This study shows that conditional inactivation of both Nf1
and Pten genes in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells
results in lethality by 15 days after birth. Histopathologic
analyses of enlarged peripheral nerves isolated from DNf1/
DPten animals classiﬁed tumors as high-grade PNSTs,
in
contrast to the low-grade PNSTs in DNf1/Pten-het animals.
Interestingly, Pten dosage augmented the peripheral nervous
system phenotype in the context of Nf1 inactivation in
Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells, but peripheral
nervous system phenotype was not signiﬁcantly affected by
Nf1 dosage in the context of Pten inactivation (Fig. 1B). It has
also been previously shown that Pten dosage in mice is
essential for neuroﬁbroma development and malignant trans-
formation, but not in the context of Nf1 loss in Schwann cells
and/or their precursor cells (13). Gregorian and colleagues
used the mGFAP-Cre together with conditional Nf1 and Pten
alleles but found no tumors. This discrepancy in phenotype
could be attributed to the different Cre used, which may
represent a difference in the initiating cell type or strain
background effects (13). Importantly, this conditional inacti-
vation of Pten and Nf1 mouse model can accurately recapit-
ulate the different peripheral nervous phenotypes associated
with the human NF1 syndrome (Fig. 3).

Human NF1 patients' neuroﬁbromas seem to undergo
changes that result in reduced PTEN expression during the
progression from benign neuroﬁbromas to MPNSTs (Fig. 5A
and B). This may also be occurring in sporadic cases of MPNSTs
as previous direct comparative microarray expression analyses
showed no consistent differences between NF1-associated and
sporadic MPNSTs (21). Thus, we propose that loss of PTEN is an
important step in the malignant progression of neuroﬁbromas.
This hypothesis was further strengthened when in a separate
forward genetic screen for genes responsible for sporadic
MPNST using the Sleeping Beauty transposon insertional muta-
genesis system, Nf1 and Pten were identiﬁed as 2 potential
mutational driver genes in the majority of high-grade PNSTs
(manuscript in preparation).

DNf1/Pten-het animals developed low-grade PNSTs earlier
compared with DNf1 control animals, indicating that Pten
dosage is important for neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis in the
context of Nf1 loss in Schwann cells and/or their precursor
cells. There was no statistical difference in the survival rate
between DPten and DNf1 (P ¼ 0.3660, log-rank test), indicating
that loss of either tumor suppressor gene can promote
Schwann cell tumorigenesis. Constitutive activation of either
Ras/Mapk/Erk or Pi3k/Akt/mTor pathways alone may not be
sufﬁcient for tumor initiation and/or progression as DNf1 and
DPten animals control animals develop a peripheral nervous
system phenotype similar to one another (Table 1). When one
allele of Pten was inactivated in the context of Nf1 loss to allow
for partial activation of the Pi3k/Akt/mTor pathway, we
observed a signiﬁcantly reduced latency in tumorigenesis
when compared with animals with Nf1 inactivated only. As
DNf1/Pten-het tumors retained Pten protein expression (Fig.
4C), this result suggests that Pten is haploinsufﬁcient for tumor
suppression in this context. Genetic events that reduce PTEN

normal human sciatic nerve tissues (N) and solid tumors from dermal neuroﬁbromas (dNF), plexiform neuroﬁbromas (pNF), and malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNST). As expected, there was a reduction in NF1 expression levels from all stages of the disease. As the disease progressed from a benign
to malignant form, decrease in PTEN expression was observed. Red, increase in red intensity as expression increases; blue, increase in blue intensity as
expression decreases. C, conditional inactivation of Nf1 in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells resulted in low-grade PNST tumorigenesis at low
penetrance (left). However, partial conditional inactivation of Pten in the context of Nf1 loss in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells resulted in reduced
latency of low-grade PNST tumorigenesis when compared with mice with Nf1 conditional inactivation only. Genetic events that reduce PTEN expression or
activity are likely to be strongly selected for during MPNST progression (middle). In contrast, conditional inactivation of both Pten and Nf1 in Schwann cells
and/or their precursor cells resulted in high-grade PNST initiation and/or progression due to the upregulation of both Ras/Mapk/Erk and Pi3k/Akt/mTor
signaling pathways (right). Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox (DNf1), Dhh-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox; Ptenﬂox/þ

expression or activity are likely to be strongly selected for
during MPNST progression. Thus, therapeutic agents that
target PI3K/AKT signaling may be very useful for MPNST
treatment or prevention strategies. Latency was further
reduced and transformation augmented when both Nf1 and
Pten were inactivated, increasing tumor multiplicity and dis-
ease progression from low-grade to high-grade PNSTs, with
both Ras/Mapk/Erk and Pi3k/Akt/mTor pathways activated
(Fig. 4A and 5C). It has been shown that the activation of the
PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways may be respon-
sible for the underlying biologic aggressiveness in human
pilocytic astrocytomas, a condition also found in NF1 patients
(22). This could be precisely what is occurring in this novel

mouse model with conditional inactivation of Nf1 and Pten in
Schwann cells, as evident with the rapid manifestation of high-
grade PNSTs. Staining for pS6 in both DNf1/DPten and DNf1/
Pten-het peripheral nerves suggest activation of mTor signaling
(Fig. 4A). However, hyperactivation of mTor signaling has also
been shown in Nf1

astrocytes (23).

 / 

Taken together, these results suggest that Pten dosage, in the
context of Nf1 loss in Schwann cells and/or their precursor
cells, is essential for the progression from low-grade to high-
grade PNSTs. Interestingly, both DNf1/Pten-het and DNf1/
DPten animals generated a variety of different peripheral
nervous system phenotype commonly seen in human NF1
patients, with higher penetrance and phenotypic diversity seen

in DNf1/DPten animals (Table 1). Thus, this model can be
used to accurately recapitulate the human disease and to
potentially rapidly test a variety of pharmaceutical com-
pounds in vivo.
