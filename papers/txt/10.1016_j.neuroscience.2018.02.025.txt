Collapsin Response Mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is an
abundant protein, comprising  0.05% of embryonic
brain (Goshima et al., 1995). It was ﬁrst discovered as a
protein necessary for mediating Semaphorin 3A (Col-
lapsin)-evoked calcium currents in oocytes and growth
cone collapse in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons
(Goshima et al., 1995). Since 1995, CRMP2 has been
reported to be a nuclear, juxtamembrane and cytosolic
protein, wherein it plays a role in physiological processes
including, lymphocyte chemotaxis (Vincent et al., 2005),
cancer cell proliferation (Moutal et al., 2017), axonal guid-
ance, (Kamata et al., 1998) or intracellular traﬃcking
(Brittain et al., 2011;Dustrude et al., 2016). The report
by Castillo and colleagues in this issue of Neuroscience
(Castillo et al., 2018) challenges the ﬁeld’s dogmatic view
of CRMP2 as a solely intracellular protein serving intracel-
lular functions.

In this groundbreaking study (Castillo et al., 2018),
Castillo and colleagues identiﬁed CRMP2 as a compo-
nent of conditioned media (CM) from degenerated sciatic
nerve, optic nerve, and Schwann cells. However, whether
CRMP2 was actively secreted from degenerating nerves
or originated from cellular debris was not explored.
Notwithstanding the source, CRMP2 elicited a Ca2+ inﬂux
through
calcium
(CaV2.2) channels and postsynaptic ligand-gated N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Fig. 1). Inhibition
of CM-evoked Ca2+ inﬂux was observed with a cell-
impermeant blocking peptide derived from CRMP2 (i.e.,
CBD3), while extracellular application of puriﬁed CRMP2
was suﬃcient to elicit Ca2+ inﬂux, congruent with an
extracellular function for CRMP2. A possible extracellular

role for CRMP2 had been suggested by prior reports
demonstrating that extracellular application of antibodies
against CRMP2 were able to aﬀect both neurite outgrowth
of DRG neurons (Goshima et al., 1995;Quach et al.,
2004) and Semaphorin 3A-induced branching of oligo-
dendrocytes (Ricard et al., 2001). The presence of
CRMP2 in the extracellular milieu may explain the per-
plexing ﬁndings of auto-antibodies targeting presump-
tively cytosolic CRMP2 in patients with autism (Piras
et al., 2014) or autoimmune retinopathy (Adamus et al.,
2013).

The ﬁndings by Castillo and colleagues identify
potential pathophysiological roles for secreted CRMP2
(Castillo et al., 2018). Notably, the secretion of CRMP2
from a degenerated sciatic nerve or from Schwann cells
could be of high relevance in demyelinating diseases like
multiple sclerosis or in chronic pain. Excessive CRMP2
secretion by degenerating Schwann cells could alter neu-
ronal signaling by increasing activation of NMDARs thus
leading to unabated Ca2+ inﬂux that may culminate in cell
death. CRMP2 was found to bind to and control the traf-
ﬁcking of both CaV2.2 channels and NMDA receptors
(Brittain et al., 2011; Brustovetsky et al., 2014). Since
both membrane-delimited proteins are involved in noci-
ceptive signal transmission (Bourinet et al., 2014), the
ability of secreted CRMP2 to facilitate CaV2.2- and
NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ inﬂux suggests a link to nocicep-
tion. Application of a cell-permeable, CRMP2-derived
peptide directly onto the spinal cord resulted in anti-noci-
ception in models of inﬂammatory and neuropathic pain
(Brittain et al., 2011). The novel ﬁnding of an extracellular
CRMP2 calls into question the provenance of this beneﬁ-
cial eﬀect – i.e., was it intracellular or extracellular? These
lines of evidence raise the possibility of an extracellular
CRMP2 participating in chronic pain signaling through
positive regulation of CaV2.2 and NMDAR.

The idea that CRMP2 can be secreted and act on pre-
and/or post-synaptic sites to elicit a Ca2+ inﬂux is exciting
and raises numerous novel questions:

the salient ﬁndings of Castillo and colleagues
(Castillo et al., 2018) demonstrating convergent regulation of calcium
signaling via actions on intracellular as well as extracellular domains
of voltage- (CaV2.2) and ligand- (NMDA) gated calcium channels. An
intracellular pool of CRMP2 could positively regulate membrane
localization of CaV2.2 channels and NMDA receptors. An extracel-
lular pool of CRMP2 could synchronize presynaptic vesicle release
gated by calcium inﬂux via CaV2.2 to postsynaptic facilitation of
NMDA receptors; however, not all cells respond to extracellular
CRMP2. Together, both intracellular and extracellular CRMP2 pools
may coordinate unconventional synaptic transmission, placing
CRMP2 as a possible atypical neurotransmitter. At present, exactly
how CRMP2 journeys to the outside of the cell is not known.

extracellular CRMP2 contribute to neurodevelopmental
disorders like bipolar disorders (Tobe et al., 2017)?; (ii)
could extracellular CRMP2 participate in NMDAR loss of
function in autism spectrum disorders (Hu et al., 2016)
by triggering production of anti-CRMP2 auto-antibodies?;
(iii) what would be the eﬀect of secreted CRMP2 on the
establishment of long-term potentiation?; (iv) could secre-
tion of CRMP2 following a nerve injury elicit chronic pain?;
(v) which post-translationally modiﬁed state of CRMP2
(phosphorylation, oxidation, or SUMOylation (Dustrude
et al., 2016)) is secreted?; and (vi) how does secretion
of CRMP2 occur, i.e. does it involve an active process
or could it be a leak from the cytoplasm of damaged
cells?.

Finally, an exciting and provocative question arises
from the demonstration that CM-CRMP2 triggered
opening of NMDARs. Other ligands doing so have been
classiﬁed as agonists and/or neurotransmitters. Thus,
future studies aimed at deﬁning the biological relevance
of secreted CRMP2 will need to consider whether
