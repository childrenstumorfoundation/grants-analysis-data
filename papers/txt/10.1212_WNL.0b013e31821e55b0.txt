Whole-body imaging in schwannomatosis

Figure

Imaging

Coronal whole-body MRI (A) showing numerous mass lesions (short arrows) in a patient with schwannomatosis. FDG-PET (B)
also shows the lesions, but MRI better depicts anatomy and displays lesions of any etiology regardless of FDG avidity.
Muscle denervation (large arrows) is seen as edema-like T2 hyperintensity without perifascial edema on MRI.

A 23-year-old man with schwannomatosis1 was imaged with whole-body MRI and 18F FDG-PET to assess the extent of
disease prior to initiating systemic therapy for new and growing tumors. The patient had undergone multiple prior
resections of schwannomas from peripheral nerves. He had ongoing pain, diffuse dysesthesias, and bilateral upper extrem-
ity weakness. Assessment of disease burden was similar on both modalities (small arrows). MRI (figure, A) has superior
demonstration of tumor localization and muscle denervation changes (large arrows) due to better contrast and spatial
resolution than FDG-PET (figure, B).2 FDG-PET demonstrated avid uptake in these benign lesions.
