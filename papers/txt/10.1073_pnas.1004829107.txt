Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common single-
gene causes of learning disabilities. Here, we use behavioral
working memory probes and electrophysiological studies in a mouse
model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null mutants; Nf1+/−) to demon-
strate that (i) Neuroﬁbromin regulates prefrontal and striatal inhib-
itory networks, speciﬁcally activity-dependent GABA release and (ii)
is required for working memory performance, with inhibition-
dependent working memory deﬁcits seen in Nf1+/− mice. We ﬁnd
that increased inhibition in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is sufﬁ-
cient to alter persistent activity in a biophysical model of an mPFC
microcircuit, suggesting a possible mechanism for Nf1+/− working
memory deﬁcits. Accordingly, working memory assays applied dur-
ing functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with NF1 reveal
hypoactivation of corticostriatal networks, which is associated with
impaired working memory performance. Collectively, these integra-
tive mouse and human studies reveal molecular and cellular mech-
anisms contributing to working memory deﬁcits in NF1.
GABA | Ras | prefrontal cortex | learning disability | neuroﬁbromatosis type I
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a valuable model for un-

derstanding mechanisms of learning disabilities (1). NF1 is
a common genetic disorder (incidence 1:3,000) that results from
mutations in a single gene (Nf1) that encodes the neuroﬁbromin
protein (2, 3). Speciﬁc deﬁcits in the domains of visuospatial and
executive functions are among the most common cognitive deﬁ-
cits associated with this syndrome (1, 4, 5). Previous mechanistic
studies in a mouse model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null mutants
or Nf1+/−) demonstrated that neuroﬁbromin modulates Ras-
dependent GABA release in the hippocampus, which in turn
modulates long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampal-
dependent learning (6, 7). However, the mechanisms underlying
frontal executive dysfunction in NF1, including prominent work-
ing memory deﬁcits (5), are unknown. Therefore, to investigate
mechanisms underlying working memory deﬁcits associated with
the NF1 mutation we carried out parallel experiments in mice
and humans.

Working memory is a cognitive construct involving the ability to
hold and update information transiently in mind in the service of
higher-order cognitive activities. Executive functions, including
working memory, are thought to depend on common cortico-
striatal networks (8–11). Therefore, our experiments focused on
frontal corticostriatal circuitry, with an emphasis on the dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in humans, thought to be critical
for working memory (12), and its functionally analogous structure
in rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (13, 14).
Here, we report Ras-dependent increases in GABA release in
the mPFC and striatum of the Nf1+/− mouse model. Increased
GABAergic inhibition is likely to be responsible for the working
memory deﬁcits that we found in the Nf1+/− mice because these
deﬁcits could be reversed with a drug that decreased inhibition.
Further, functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with

NF1 revealed decreased neural activity in frontal corticostriatal
networks in NF1 patients that correlated with their degree of
working memory impairment. These convergent cross-species
ﬁndings support the hypothesis that working memory deﬁcits
associated with the NF1 mutation in both mice and humans
are caused by loss of neuroﬁbromin regulation of frontal corti-
costriatal inhibition.

Results
Nf1 Regulates Activity-Dependent GABA Release in Prefrontal Cortex.
The Nf1+/− mutation was previously shown to alter GABAergic
inhibition in the hippocampus in mice (6, 7). Because prefrontal
dysfunction could account for the prominent executive function
deﬁcits associated with NF1, we studied inhibition in mPFC of
Nf1+/− mice. We focused on this area because of its homology to
human DLPFC and its key role in rodent working memory tasks
(14, 15). We used whole-cell patch clamp to record spontaneous
synaptic activity induced by local inhibitory and excitatory net-
works in single neurons within layer II/III in acute slices from adult
mice. Our results show that in the mPFC of Nf1+/− mice, the fre-
quency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) is
signiﬁcantly higher (P = 0.02) than in WT littermate controls; this
increase in frequency was observed across all sIPSC amplitudes
(P < 0.001; Fig.1A). Also, analysis of the cumulative distribution of
the intervals between sIPSCs conﬁrmed an increased frequency in
Nf1+/− mice (P < 0.001; Fig. S1A). In contrast, the frequency of
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) recorded
in the same neurons is not altered in Nf1+/− mice (P = 0.69; Fig.
1B). Importantly, the Nf1+/− mutation did not affect the kinetics of
either sIPSCs or sEPSCs (Fig. S1B) in the mPFC. Because both
sIPSCs and sEPSCs were recorded in the same neurons, these data
also demonstrate that the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory drive
onto those neurons is abnormally low in the Nf1+/− mice.
We next examined causes of increased inhibition in the Nf1+/−
mice. Speciﬁcally, we asked whether the increased inhibition in
the Nf1+/− mice is caused by a cell autonomous effect of Nf1
deletion in interneurons. To assess this directly, we used the Cre/
loxP system to create Dlx-Cre+;Nf1ﬂox/+ mice with a heterozygous
deletion of Nf1 restricted to inhibitory interneurons in the pre-
frontal cortex (7, 16). Dlx-Cre+;Nf1ﬂox/+ mice show an increased
frequency of sIPSCs (P = 0.006; Fig. 1C) compared with control

ciﬁcally, we focused on the Ras signaling pathway, as Nf1 encodes
a negative regulator of Ras signaling (neuroﬁbromin) (17, 18),
and increased Ras activity has been previously reported in pre-
frontal cortex of Nf1+/− mice (19). To study whether increased
inhibition in Nf1+/− mice is Ras dependent, we decreased Ras
signaling in mPFC slices from Nf1+/− mice using bath application
of U0126 (10 μM). U0126 functions as a noncompetitive inhibitor
of MEK, a downstream effector of Ras. A signiﬁcant effect of
U0126 application on sIPSC frequency (P = 0.003; Fig. 2A) was
seen. Importantly, U0126 eliminated the difference in sIPSC
frequency between genotypes (P = 0.553) that was observed be-
fore U0126 application (P = 0.028). U0126 also decreased sEPSC
frequency (P = 0.012; Fig. 2B, Right), but to the same degree
across genotypes (P = 0.357; Fig. 2B, Left). These data suggest
that increased GABA release from inhibitory networks in Nf1+/−
mice is Ras/MEK dependent and that neuroﬁbromin plays an
important role in inhibitory, but not excitatory neurons, to mod-
ulate Ras-dependent neurotransmitter release.
Levels of Inhibition Seen in Nf1+/− Mice Alter Persistent Activity in
a Computational Model. As other mechanisms may be altered in
Nf1+/− mice, we wished to further explore the signiﬁcance of
neuroﬁbromin modulation of mPFC inhibitory networks. A
computational approach allowed us to manipulate inhibition in
isolation within a model prefrontal microcircuit in which we in-
corporated the background levels of sIPSCs and sEPSCs mea-
sured in Nf1+/− and WT mice. This allowed us to ask whether
inhibitory changes seen in Nf1+/− mice could on their own be
sufﬁcient
to signiﬁcantly affect complex network properties
thought to be important for working memory. We focused on the
ability of prefrontal networks to sustain persistent activity fol-
lowing a transient stimulus, as this property is thought to be
modulated by GABA-dependent inhibition (20–22), and is crit-
ical for working memory (23, 24). When using WT values for
sIPSC and sEPSC frequency, persistent activity lasting more than
3 s was induced using synchronous, single pulse stimulation with
a probability of 0.84 in our model microcircuit. When the fre-
quency of background inhibitory activity was increased to levels
seen in the Nf1+/− mPFC, the probability for induction of per-
sistent activity was decreased by 35% (Fig. S2A). These results
suggest that the increased inhibition seen in Nf1+/− prefrontal
networks is sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly alter the likelihood of ini-

groups, demonstrating that Nf1 regulates inhibitory release from
mPFC interneurons. This action of Nf1 within interneurons is
conﬁrmed pharmacologically: in the presence of CNQX(10 μM)
and APV (50 μM), which blocks excitatory drive, Nf1+/− mice still
showed a higher frequency of sIPSCs (P = 0.009; Fig. 1D) in
mPFC. It is important to note that this difference is driven by the
more frequent small amplitude sIPSCs (Fig. 1 C and D); large
amplitude sIPSCs are comparatively rare, and therefore we could
not determine whether their frequency is also different between
mutants and controls.
We next examined how the Nf1+/− mutation affected in-
terneuron function. It is possible that the increase in sIPSCs fre-
quency is caused by activity-dependent changes,
such as
excitability. To address this possibility, we blocked action poten-
tials in the slice with TTX (1 μM), and recorded miniature IPSCs
(mIPSCs) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons. An analysis of the
cumulative distribution of the intervals between mIPSCs revealed
no differences between Nf1+/− mice and WT controls (P = 1; Fig.
S1C). These data demonstrate that the increased frequency of
inhibitory currents observed in Nf1+/− mice is activity-dependent.
Cumulative amplitude distributions of mIPSCs in mPFC were
also examined in TTX, and no differences between Nf1+/− mice
and WT were found (P = 0.585; Fig. S1C). In combination, these
experiments demonstrate that Nf1 affects the inhibitory system
most prominently by regulating activity-dependent GABAergic
release in mPFC.

We next investigated molecular mechanisms by which the Nf1
mutation leads to increased activity-dependent inhibition. Spe-

mice showed increased total within-phase errors (P = 0.047; Fig.
4B). The increase in within-phase errors is most evident in days 1–6
of the task (P = 0.024; Fig. 4D). With three additional days of
training (days 7–9), within-phase errors in the Nf1+/− mutants
decreased to WT levels (P = 0.74). In contrast to within-phase
errors, the total number of across-phase errors in the Nf1+/− group
was not different from WT (P = 0.403; Fig. 4C). These data
demonstrate that the Nf1+/− mice show a speciﬁc increase in
within-phase errors in the testing phase of the delayed win-shift
radial arm maze.

Further, this deﬁcit is sensitive to a low dose of picrotoxin (0.025
mg/kg; i.p.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Analysis of within-
phase errors on the testing phase identiﬁed a differential effect of
picrotoxin on Nf1+/− and WT mice across days 1–6 (P = 0.009; Fig.
4E). Importantly, the dose of picrotoxin that improved the per-
formance of Nf1+/− mice (within-phase errors on the testing phase;
P = 0.047) did not affect WT (P = 0.77). Furthermore, picrotoxin
did not affect across phase errors in either genotype (P = 0.184;
Fig. S4). This result demonstrates the behavioral speciﬁcity of the
picrotoxin manipulation and provides evidence that the increased
inhibition in Nf1+/− mice disrupts behavior.

Increased within-phase errors in the delayed win-shift radial arm
maze could potentially reﬂect failures of working memory, al-
though failure of other higher level executive functions could also
contribute. To speciﬁcally address working memory function in
Nf1+/− mice, we tested performance on an operant spatial delayed
nonmatch to sample task (29–31). In this task, mice are given serial

tiation of persistent activity, a network property required for
working memory in nonprimate and primate studies.
Increased Inhibitory Tone in Striatum of Nf1+/− Mice. In addition to
prefrontal contributions to working memory, a distributed network
of cortical and subcortical brain structures subserves the execution
of behaviors involving working memory in nonprimate and primate
studies. In particular, the striatum interacts closely with the pre-
frontal cortex in a circuit thought to be important for working
memory (25). We therefore examined whether the Nf1+/− mice
show increased inhibition in the striatum, similar to that seen in the
mPFC. Whole cell recordings from medium-sized spiny neurons
(MSNs) in the striatum were carried out and we analyzed fre-
quency of sIPSCs, sEPSCs, and mIPSCs (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3). As in
mPFC, frequency of sIPSCs onto MSNs is signiﬁcantly higher than
that seen in WT (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A), although frequency of
mIPSCs is unchanged (Fig. S3A). In contrast, the frequency of
sEPSCs recorded in the same neurons, is not different between
WT and Nf1+/− mice (P = 0.56; Fig. 3B). These data indicate that
the striatum of Nf1+/− mice shows an activity-dependent increase
in frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory events.
Behavioral Working Memory Deﬁcits in Nf1+/− Mice. Next, we ex-
amined the behavioral impact of increased inhibition in prefrontal
cortex and striatum in Nf1+/− mice. We started by testing the mice
in a behavioral task known to depend on the corticostriatal net-
work, the delayed win-shift radial arm maze (15, 26, 27). This task
is carried out in two phases such that the location of arms entered
in a training phase must be maintained over a delay period and
used to guide entries into unvisited arms during a testing phase.
Within-phase errors during the task reﬂect re-entries into an arm
already visited during the same phase. Prefrontal and striatal (15,
28), but not hippocampal, lesions increase these errors in the
testing phase. Across-phase errors reﬂect entries of arms in the
testing phase that were previously visited during the training phase.
Throughout 10 d of delayed win-shift radial arm maze, the Nf1+/−
mice showed normal training phase performance compared with
WT (P = 0.883; Fig. 4A). However, in the testing phase, Nf1+/−

trials, each consisting of two phases (sample presentation and
choice) separated by a variable delay of 3–10 s. Both Nf1+/− and
WT mice showed comparable ability to accurately respond to the
cue presented in the sample phase, indicating that sensorimotor
function, motivation, and response selection were normal in Nf1+/−
mice. However, in the choice phase of delayed testing, the Nf1+/−
mice showed an impairment (P = 0.043; Fig. 4F): they showed poor
accuracy across all delays tested, although WT mice showed higher
performance at 3–6 s delays, but signiﬁcantly decreased accuracy
(P = 0.02) as delays increased up to 10 s. The delay dependent
performance of the WT mice suggests that working memory can
support performance on this task successfully across delays up
to 6 s, with performance decreasing as the task becomes more
challenging. However, in Nf1+/− mice, working memory cannot
support accurate performance, even at intervals of 3–6 s.

This working memory impairment was also improved by a low
dose (0.025 mg/kg) of picrotoxin (P = 0.037; Fig. 4G). Picrotoxin
signiﬁcantly improved the pattern of performance across delays
in Nf1+/− mice (P = 0.025) but did not affect performance of WT
mice (P = 0.389). In both tasks, the dose of picrotoxin used is
similar to that previously seen to improve long-term memory in
WT (7). Together, these studies suggest that Nf1+/− mice show
behavioral deﬁcits that are related to increased inhibition and
speciﬁcally affect working memory.

Working Memory-Associated Corticostriatal Dysfunction in Human
NF1. Using a combination of cognitive testing and fMRI, we next
determined whether human patients with NF1 also demonstrate
working memory deﬁcits related to corticostriatal dysfunction.
We used two visuospatial working memory tasks that parallel the
operant delayed nonmatch to sample task used with Nf1+/− mice
and are known to activate a network of cortical and striatal brain
structures (32, 33). Within the prefrontal cortex, fMRI analysis
focused on the DLPFC, an area in primates that is functionally
homologous to mPFC in rodents (13, 14, 34). Additionally,
regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal eye ﬁelds and parietal cortex
were examined, as these areas are consistently recruited during
working memory tasks in human and nonhuman primates (35).
The ﬁrst task assesses spatial working memory maintenance
and manipulation (stMNM). NF1 individuals showed signiﬁ-
cantly lower accuracy across both the spatial working memory
maintenance and manipulation conditions than controls (P =
0.019; Fig. 5A). During fMRI task performance, NF1 individuals
showed signiﬁcantly reduced neural activity relative to controls

in both cortical (DLPFC, P = 0.036; frontal eye ﬁelds, P < 0.001;
parietal cortex, P < 0.001; Fig. 5C) and striatal brain regions
(caudate, P = 0.006; putamen, P = 0.015; Fig. 5C). Right
DLPFC activation signiﬁcantly predicted stMNM performance
in NF1 individuals (F1,11 = 8.69, P = 0.013; r2 = 0.3119; Fig. 6A)
in a robust regression analysis.

Consistent ﬁndings were observed in the second task, a para-
metric probe of spatial working memory capacity (SCAP) (32).
NF1 individuals showed signiﬁcantly lower accuracy relative to
controls overall (P = 0.03; Fig. 5B), with a steeper decline in
performance accuracy as memory load increased (P = 0.016).
Using a robust regression analysis, task performance was again
signiﬁcantly predicted by right DLPFC activation in NF1 indi-
viduals (F1,11 = 50.86, P < 0.001; r2 = 0.5398; Fig. 6B). Addi-
tionally, NF1 individuals showed reduced neural activation
compared with controls in two right-lateralized cortical areas
critical
information in working
memory, the right frontal eye ﬁelds (P = 0.002; Fig. 5C) and the
right parietal cortex (P = 0.003; Fig. 5C). In controls, task-
associated deactivation was observed in the medial PFC during
task performance. However, this task-associated decrease was
signiﬁcantly attenuated in NF1 individuals (P = 0.020; Fig. 5C).

Overall, during SCAP performance, patients with NF1 evidenced
abnormal regulation of prefrontal and related cortical structures.
As predicted by our mouse studies, our human studies indicate
that blunted activation of corticostriatal networks, normally re-
cruited during spatial working memory performance, is directly
related to working memory impairments characteristic of NF1.

Discussion
Here, we report convergent evidence from parallel studies in
transgenic mice and human patients regarding the mechanisms
underlying working memory deﬁcits associated with Nf1 muta-
tions. A key ﬁnding in the Nf1+/− mouse experiments is that
neuroﬁbromin is an important molecular regulator of interneu-
ronal activity in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, brain regions
critical for working memory performance. The convergence be-
tween our mouse behavioral, electrophysiological, and compu-
tational modeling results indicate that the increased inhibition
observed in Nf1+/− mice disrupts corticostriatal activity and
contributes to working memory deﬁcits, a conclusion supported
by an extensive literature that connects inhibition to working
memory. These data highlight the importance of neuroﬁbromin
signaling to function of corticostriatal
inhibitory networks
during behavior, speciﬁcally during working memory in the
Nf1+/− mice.
Our studies in human patients reveal striking convergence
with ﬁndings in Nf1+/− mice. With working memory tasks highly
homologous to those used in mice, we ﬁnd that loss of neuro-
ﬁbromin is associated with corticostriatal dysfunction and that
this dysfunction is directly correlated with working memory
deﬁcits. Performing parallel experiments across species offers the
unique opportunity to gain deeper insight into the basis of neural
changes seen using in vivo neuroimaging studies in humans. In
particular, our convergent cross-species ﬁndings suggest that
hypoactivation of corticostriatal structures, observed with fMRI
in NF1 patients, may be caused by increased GABA(A) receptor
signaling. Similar effects have been noted in other fMRI studies
of healthy subjects given GABA(A) agonists (36). By directly
examining parallel effects of Nf1 mutations across species in
homologous neuronal circuits and behavioral tasks, we provide
evidence that neuroﬁbromin/Ras signaling in both mice and
humans regulates working memory by modulating inhibition in
prefrontal cortical and striatal networks.

Interestingly, altered inhibition relative to excitation has been
seen in other animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders in
which corticostriatal hypoactivation and working memory deﬁcits
are also found. For example, working memory deﬁcits have been
demonstrated in Down’s syndrome (37, 38), Fragile X (39), and
Turner syndrome (40). These deﬁcits were associated with cor-
ticostriatal hypoactivation in fMRI studies of individuals with
Fragile X (39) and Turner’s syndrome (40). Animal models of
these disorders have identiﬁed altered regulation of inhibition.
Both Rett syndrome (Mecp2 mutant mice) (41) and Down’s
syndrome (Ts65Dn mice) (42) animal models show increased
inhibitory drive. The Fragile X animal model (Fmr1 knockout
mice) shows reduced excitatory drive onto cortical GABAergic
interneurons (43) as well as increased GABAergic inhibition in
striatum (44). Taken together, these studies of other neuro-
developmental disorders are consistent with our ﬁndings in NF1.
Across these models, abnormal inhibition alters multiple syn-
aptic properties, from cortical UP states in the Fragile X mice to
hippocampal LTP in the Ts65Dn mice (42). Within each disor-
der,
inhibition-dependent changes likely interact with other
molecular mechanisms affected by the disease (for example,
enhanced responses to mGluR in Fragile X) (45) to generate
cognitive symptoms. Our ﬁndings indicate that working memory
has conserved and homologous underpinnings in both mouse
and humans that could be leveraged to further study the complex

molecular and cellular mechanisms disrupted by genetic muta-
tions associated with developmental learning disabilities.

Methods
Animal Subjects. Nf1+/− and WT mice, as well as Dlx-Cre+;Nf1ﬂox/+ and their
control littermates, were on a hybrid background of C57BL/6NTac and 129T2/
SvEmsJ. Dlx-Cre+;Nf1ﬂox/+ mice and controls were from a cross between a line
expressing Cre under the Dlx promoter and a line expressing a ﬂoxed Nf1 allele
(46). All experiments used littermates as controls and were done with the ex-
perimenter blinded to genotype. Behavioral experiments were conducted
with animals food-deprived to 85% of their starting weight. Behavior and
electrophysiology was carried out on mice of the same age range (3–8 mo old).

Animal Studies. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made in acute slices
containing mPFC or striatum as previously described (47). Event detection was
carried out off-line using MiniAnalysis software. Threshold for event de-
tection was set above the root mean square noise level (usually 10 pA for
sIPSCs, 5 pA for sEPSCs). Analysis was carried out blind to genotype.

Delayed win-shift radial arm maze task was carried out on an eight arm
apparatus. Access to each arm from a central platform was regulated by
a guillotine door. Reward pellets (14 mg grain based pellet; Bio-Serv) were
placed at the end of each arm. Mice were habituated to the apparatus for
2 d. The task consisted of one training phase, followed by a 2-min delay,
followed by a testing phase. The training phase required mice to make
single entries into four baited arms. The testing phase required mice to
make single entries into new arms that were not visited during the training
phase. This series was run once per mouse per day for 10 d. The delayed
nonmatch to sample task was adapted from procedures previously de-
scribed in mice (31). During training on the nonmatch to sample rule, two
WT mice failed to meet the criterion level of 70% correct responding and
were subsequently dropped from further testing. Picrotoxin and saline
injections were carried out in the home cage 20 min before start of the
training phase.

Biophysical Model. The compartmental model of a layer II/III PFC pyramidal
neuron was implemented in the NEURON simulation environment (48) and
consisted of ﬁve compartments. The model was validated against experi-
mental data recorded in this study (Fig. S2 C–E). Four pyramidal model
neurons were connected in a recurrent circuit that also included one in-
terneuron. Background inhibition and excitation in the model is based on
experimental data described within this paper. Persistent activity was in-
duced by providing a synchronous, single pulse stimulation of 40 synapses on
the proximal dendrite of each model pyramidal neuron. The arrangement of
these synapses varied randomly during 100 repetition trials.

Human Subjects. Fourteen individuals with NF1 and 12 controls with compa-
rable demographics (Table S1) were recruited. A standard neuropsychological
battery was performed (Table S2). NF1 and control individuals were recruited
via advertisement and provided written consent for participation, as ap-
proved by the institutional review board of the University of California, Los
Angeles, CA. NF1 individuals had been previously diagnosed by a physician
with NF1; diagnoses were conﬁrmed by clinical interview. Controls did not
have Axis-I psychiatric or neurological disorders as assessed by the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Exclusion criteria were signiﬁcant and habitual
substance use in the last 6 mo, history of head injury, mental retardation (IQ
less than 70), and insufﬁcient ﬂuency in the English language.

Human Behavioral Task Paradigms. Study participants performed two spatial
delayed response tasks, one contrasting maintenance and manipulation of
spatial memoranda consisting of arrays of three dots [stMNM (32, 33)] and
the other assessing parametrically increasing memory loads [SCAP (33)]
consisting of arrays of increasing numbers of dots. Behavioral data were
analyzed in SPSS, using repeated measures ANOVA.

fMRI Methods. All scans were acquired on a 3T Siemens Allegra scanner at
University of California, Los Angeles, CA. Functional slices used an echo planar
(EPI) sequence (TR/TE 3000/45 ms, 90° ﬂip angle, 33 3-mm slices). A T2-weighted
image for anatomical registration (TR/TE 5000/33 ms, 33 3-mm slices with 1-mm
gap, 128 × 128 matrix, 200-mm FOV) was taken in the same AC-PC aligned
plane as the functional scans. SCAP consisted of 180 scans with duration of
9 min; stMNM consisted of 256 scans with duration of 12 min, 45-s image
analysis was performed in FMRIB’s Software Library v 3.3 (FSL) (49). Individual
subject analyses were carried out using FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). EPI
data were corrected for motion, spatially smoothed (5-mm FWHM Gaussian

kernel), high pass ﬁltered (72 s) and then registered, ﬁrst to the subject’s in-
dividual T2-image, then to the MNI-152 brain (50, 51). Time-series statistical
analysis was carried out using FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model (FILM). Each
condition was modeled for stMNM; each load was modeled separately for
SCAP, with motion included as a covariate. Group analysis was carried out
using FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME) (49, 52).

repeated measures ANOVA were performed. To assess the relationship be-
tween BOLD activation and working memory performance, a robust re-
gression was performed in Stata (v 8) for each task with functional activation
in the right DLPFC predicting accuracy (percent correct). Subjects with high
studentized residuals (>2) were excluded (one patient in each case).

Additional description of procedures is available in SI Text.

ROI Analysis. Functionally deﬁned ROIs were created in the MNI-152 standard
brain space. Using Featquery (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/feat5/featquery.
html) the motion corrected, smoothed, and ﬁltered data across each ROI was
probed for percent signal change from baseline. To control for performance,
the stMNM analysis contained only correct trials. The SCAP analysis used
performance matched loads (80%, load 3, NF1 and 84%, load 5, control). For
the SCAP, unpaired t tests were performed between groups. For the stMNM,
