Neuroﬁbromin has been identiﬁed as a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Osteoblast speciﬁc inactiva-
tion of neuroﬁbromin in mice results in a high bone mass phenotype and hyperosteoidosis. Here, we show that
inactivation of the Nf1 gene also impairs osteocyte development. We analyzed cortical bone tissue in two condi-
tional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1, for morphological and molecular effects. Backscattered electron mi-
croscopy revealed signiﬁcantly enlarged osteocyte lacunae in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice (level E2: ctrl = 1.90 ±
0.52%, Nf1Prx1 = 3.40 ± 0.95%; ctrl 1.60 ± 0.47%, Nf1Col1 2.46 ± 0.91%). Moreover, the osteocyte lacunae ap-
peared misshaped in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice as indicated by increased Feret ratios. Strongest osteocyte and
dendritic network disorganization was observed in proximity of muscle attachment sites in Nf1Prx1 humeri. In
contrast to control cells, Nf1Prx1 osteocytes contained abundant cytosolic vacuoles and accumulated immature
organic matrix within the perilacunar space, a phenotype reminiscent of the hyperosteoidosis shown Nf1 deﬁ-
cient mice. Cortical bone lysates further revealed approx. twofold upregulated MAPK signalling in osteocytes of
Nf1Prx1 mice. This was associated with transcriptional downregulation of collagens and genes involved in me-
chanical sensing in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 bone tissue. In contrast, matrix gla protein (MGP), phosphate regulating
endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX), and genes involved in lipid metabolism were upregulated. In line with
previously described hyperactivation of Nf1 deﬁcient osteoblasts, systemic plasma levels of the bone formation
markers osteocalcin (OCN) and procollagen typ I N-propeptide (PINP) were approx. twofold increased
in Nf1Prx1 mice. Histochemical and molecular analysis ascertained that osteocytes in Nf1Prx1 cortical bone
were viable and did not undergo apoptosis or autophagy. We conclude that loss of neuroﬁbromin is not only crit-
ical for osteoblasts but also hinders normal osteocyte development. These ﬁndings expand the effect of
neuroﬁbromin onto yet another cell type where it is likely involved in the regulation of mechanical sensing,
bone matrix composition and mechanical resistance of bone tissue.

Introduction

Osteocytes constitute 90% of all cells of adult cortical bone [1].
Embedded in the mineralized matrix, osteocytes communicate with one
another through a network of dendritic processes, the canalicular net-
work, and are capable of regulating local bone turnover by recruiting os-
teoclasts and osteoblasts [1–3]. Osteocytes are formed by differentiation
of mesenchymal progenitor cells into osteoblasts and their subsequent

incorporation into the bone matrix [1]. During differentiation osteocytes
acquire speciﬁc morphological properties including dendritic processes
and small cell body volume. This speciﬁc adaptation of morphology and
ultrastructure allows osteocytes to perform their function as mechano-
sensory cell embedded within the mineralized bone. The osteocyte cana-
licular system is thought to facilitate the mechanosensory function by
providing attachment sites for the cell processes, which are the main
sites of the mechanical stimulation [4].

Osteocytes respond to mechanical stimulation with rapid synthesis
of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins [1]. This in turn leads to down-
regulation of WNT pathway inhibitors SOST and DKK1, which consti-
tutes a bone-anabolic signal [5]. Osteocytes actively remodel their
perilacunar matrix with help of metalloproteinases thus regulating

phosphate and calcium availability [6]. Both osteoblasts as well as the
early osteocytes regulate the degree of matrix mineralization in their
surrounding with help of SIBLING family of proteins: osteopontin
(OPN), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) and matrix extracellular phos-
phoglycoprotein (MEPE) as well as with Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) [7].
While OPN, MEPE and MGP inhibit mineralization, DMP1 is a pro-
mineralization factor [8]. Inactivating mutations of DMP1 or endopepti-
dase PHEX result in bone mineralization defects that are associated with
increased FGF23 expression in osteocytes [9]. FGF23 is an endocrine reg-
ulator of systemic phosphate metabolism that is mainly synthesized by
osteocytes [8]. Mechanical stimulation ensures osteocyte viability by
preventing apoptosis [10]. This is achieved at least in part by the activa-
tion of focal adhesion kinases (FAKs) and extracellular signals-regulated
kinases (ERKs) [10]. In addition, ERK signalling is critical for Dmp1
expression and osteocyte differentiation [11]. Apart from apoptosis
osteocytes can undergo a process aimed at self-preservation called
autophagy, which is induced by glucocorticoids [12].

Biallelic inactivation of the Nf1 gene results in a profound skeletal
pathology in patients with Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and corre-
sponding conditional mouse models [13–15]. Inactivation of Nf1 specif-
ically in osteoblasts (Nf1Col1 mice) causes increased collagen synthesis,
but inhibits bone mineralization resulting in osteoidosis [13,14]. Osteo-
blast dysfunction is therefore an important factor contributing deterio-
ration of bone material properties [13]. We have shown that ablation of
Nf1 in undifferentiated limb mesenchyme and derivative tissues pro-
duces in Nf1Prx1 mice a severe bone phenotype characterized by in-
crease of micro-porosity, hypomineralization, a generalized defect of
organic matrix formation, and persistence of ectopic blood vessels that
are associated with localized macro-porotic bone lesions [16]. This phe-
notype overlaps with ﬁndings made in NF1 patient material suggesting
a complex mechanism leading to bone fragility in NF1 [16]. Increased
micro-porosity and reduced organic matrix quality are likely caused
by defective osteocyte development. In order to further characterize
the role of osteocytes in NF1 bone dysplasia, we now focused on the
analysis of molecular and histological aspects of the pathology in Nf1 de-
ﬁcient murine cortical bone. We hypothesize that Nf1 affects osteocyte
differentiation.

Methods

Mouse breeding and genotyping

Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice were bred and genotyped as described
previously [13,14,17]. All experimental procedures were approved by
the ‘Landesamt für Gesundheitsschutz und Technische Sicherheit
(LaGeTSi), Berlin, Germany (protocol number ZH 120) and the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Vanderbilt Uni-
versity Medical Center (protocol number M/06/508).

Protein and mRNA analysis

Cortical bone was mechanically cleaned from adjoining muscle and
connective tissue. Bone marrow was removed by a syringe ﬂush. Sepa-
rated cortical bone tissue was crashed after liquid nitrogen incubation,
mRNA lysates were generated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA) and protein lysates were obtained by incubation with RIPA buffer.
Protein expression analysis was performed with Western blot after SDS-
polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transfer onto PVDF (Amersham,
USA) membrane. For Western blot analysis, membranes were incubated
with the following antibodies: anti-activeRAS #26909 (Neweastbio),
anti-RAS #14022 (SantaCruz), anti-phospho-p42/44 (pERK1/2) #9102
(Cell Signaling), anti-p44 (ERK1) #4372 (Cell Signaling), anti-pAMPK
#4370S (Cell Signaling), anti-AMPK #9197 (Cell Signaling), anti-
pMEK1/2 #9121S (Cell Signaling), anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling), Sost
(R&D, AF1589), PARP #9542 (Cell Signaling), cleaved PARP #9541
(Cell Signaling), LC3AI/II (D50G8), LIMP II #25867 (Santa Cruz), and

anti-GAPDH #Sc-25778 (Santa Cruz). For mRNA expression analysis
full RNA was isolated according to standard protocols and transcribed
into cDNA with SuperscriptII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Expression
analysis was performed with a Taqman 7500 (ABI, USA) using Gapdh as
endogenous control. The following primer were used (5´-3´orientation):

Microarray hybridization and differential expression evaluation

RNA was isolated from cortical bone using peqGOLD TriFast (PeqLab
Biotechnologie GmbH) according to the supplied protocol. The cRNA
synthesis and microarray hybridizaton was done according to standard
protocols applied in the Laboratory of Functional Genome Research
Charité - Core Facility. A total of 8 high density oligonucleotide mouse
GENE 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) were used in this study. Samples
from each animal (Nf1, and 4 wild-type) were applied individually to
each array. All the procedures and hybridization were performed ac-
cording to the Genechip expression technical manual (Affymetrix).
One way ANOVA analysis was used to reveal the genes signiﬁcantly
deregulated in the Nf1 deﬁcient muscles (F factor ≥ 20).

Histology

For histological analysis, adult limbs were ﬁxed in buffered 4 % PFA,
dehydrated in subsequent ethanol steps and embedded in methyl
methacrylate (MMA) according standard laboratory procedures [18].
For histological assessment 5 μm plastic sections (RM2255, Leica,
Germany) were stained with a combined von Kossa/Toluidin proce-
dure [14,19]. Bright light microscopy occurred with an Olympus BX60
(Olympus, Japan). To analyse presence of acid bone matrix proteins sec-
tions were stained with AgNOR [20]. Collagenous bone matrix was
assessed with bright light microscopy after Toluidin and Safranin O
staining [21] (Leica DMRB, Germany). Histomorphometric analysis
was performed with AxioVision Software (Zeiss, Germany). Nomencla-
ture was used according ASBMR suggestions [22]. Statistical analysis
was performed with unpaired t-test, * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01.

Immunohistology

Immunodetection of proteins within mineralized cortical bone
was achieved according to a standard procedure [23]. Brieﬂy, frozen tis-
sue was sectioned (5 μm) on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Wetzlar,
Germany). Subsequently, sections were ﬁxed in PBS buffered 4 % PFA,
permeabilized with 0.1 % saponin in PBS buffered 3 % BSA, blocked
with 5 % donkey serum, and antibodies were incubated in PBS buffered
3 % BSA. The following antibodies were used for immunodetection:
panendothelial cell antigen (550563, BD Pharmingen, USA), DMP1
(AF4386, R&D, USA), anti-rabbitHRP (#7074, Cell Signalling, USA),
anti-ratAlexa555 (A11081, Invitrogen, USA), and anti-sheepAlexa555
(A21436, Invitrogen, USA). Sections were analyzed with confocal mi-
croscopy (lsm 510, Zeiss, Germany). Isotype speciﬁc secondary antibod-
ies were used in negative control experiments (data not shown).

Biochemical analysis

Plasma was collected after decapitation with standard protocols
utilizing Li-Heparin capillary tubes (GK 150 200 μl Gel grün, Kabe,
Germany). Biochemical analysis of bone parameters was achieved
with enzyme linked immunoassays detecting osteocalcin (EIA-4010,

DRG Instruments GmbH, Germany), Rankl (MTR00, R&D Systems, USA),
Opg (MOP00, R&D Systems, USA), procollagen I N-terminal propetide
(PINP) (E90957Mu, Uscn, China), Fgf23 (Kainos, Japan), and Mepe
(E91232Mu, Uscn, China). Serum and urine analysis of phosphate, calci-
um and creatinin was measured at the clinical laboratory core facility
according standard procedures.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backscattered electron microsco-
py (BSE)

For Ot. morphology assessment, MMA embedded humeri were cut
either along the cross or longitudinal sectional direction of the main
bone axis and analyzed by SEM and BSE respectively.

For SEM analysis, humeri were trimmed with a hard tissue micro-
tome to the appropriated height levels (E1, E2, E3). Etching occurred
with phosphorous acid (37 %, 12 sec), wash three times H2O, sodium
hypochlorite (4 %, 5 min), and wash for 5 min with H2O. Subsequently,
samples were spattered with gold/palladium (coating system MED020
BAL-TECH) and imaged with a SEM (DSM982GEMINI, Zeiss, Germany).
For BSE imaging MMA embedded humeri were sectioned to a medial
position showing both cortices and the bone marrow cavity. To investi-
gate bones with ESEM (FEI-Company, Oregon, USA) plastic embedded
humeri were polished to mirror ﬁnish to avoid a rough and scratched
sample surface. Therefore, different grades of abrasive paper have
been applied for several minutes. Polished samples were investigated
in low vacuum (0.75 Torr) using BSE mode at a working distance of
10 mm. The electron beam energy was set to 10 kV. A solid state detec-
tor (SSD) was used to measure the BSE signal from the sample surface.
The resulting grey level images of the mineralized bone tissue reveal re-
gions of high calcium content in bright and regions of low calcium con-
tent in dark grey, representing high and low mineral concentration in
the bone sample, respectively [24].

Results

Altered osteocyte morphology in Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 humerus cortex

Nf1 was inactivated in the mesenchymal lineage (Nf1Prx1) and in
pre-osteoblasts (Nf1Col1) as previously described [16]. In order to
analyse the morphology of osteocyte (Ot.) lacunae, we performed
backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) on methacrylate embedded
humeri of three month old mice. Cortical bone sections were analysed
along the proximo-distal axis. Three regions of interest (ROI E1-E3)
were selected for qualitative and quantitative analysis. BSE revealed
striking qualitative changes in Ot. lacunae shape in Nf1Prx1 and to a
lesser degree in Nf1Col1 bone samples (Figs. 1A, B). In controls, Ot. lacu-
nae were spindle-shaped and aligned longitudinally towards the long
bone axis in all ROIs (Figs. 1A, B). However, in Nf1Prx1 bones lacunae
appeared enlarged and irregularly distributed (Fig. 1A). Similar but
less pronounce changes were apparent in Nf1Col1 bones (Fig. 1B).
Quantitative analysis revealed increase of the relative Ot. lacunae area
per bone area (Ot.Ar/B.Ar) in mutants as compared to respective
controls (level E2: ctrl = 1.90 ± 0.52%, Nf1Prx1 = 3.40 ± 0.95%; ctrl
1.60 ± 0.47%, Nf1Col1 2.46 ± 0.91%) (Fig. 1C, Tables S1-2). In contrast,
Ot. number was not increased, with the exception of Ot. number in ROI E2
in Nf1Prx1 mice (Fig. 1D). Lacunae shape was assessed by measuring la-
cunae area (Ot.Ar) and Feret ratio on BSE images (Feret value 0 = line;
1 = circle) (Fig. 1E). Ot. area and Feret ratio was increased in Nf1Prx1
and Nf1Col1 cortical bone samples (Fig. 1E), indicating a general enlarge-
ment as well as more spherical shape of the Ot. in mutant bones.

Changes in osteocyte canalicular network and cellular morphology in Nf1
deﬁcient bones

BSE microscopy revealed a more spherical shape of Ot. in Nf1 deﬁ-
cient bone tissue (Fig. 2A). In order to characterize changes of Ot.

dendrite network morphology we applied complementary histological
techniques. AgNOR silver staining labels acidic bone matrix proteins,
allowing for visualization of the entire Ot. canalicular network
(Fig. 2B) [20]. In control bone tissue, the most homogenous distribution
of canalicular network was observed in the region E2, which is far from
the muscle attachment sites. In this region Ot. were aligned with their
long axis towards the circular collagen orientation. Control Ot. had
long fragments of canaliculi visible in the section plane perpendicularly
to the cell body (Fig. 2B). In contrast, canaliculi in Nf1Prx1 bone ap-
peared shorter and unevenly distributed in proximity of mutant Ot.,
indicating either altered dendrite number or distribution (Fig. 2B).
Striking changes of the Ot. morphology were also seen by scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM) (Figs. 2C and 3). Analysis of subcellular organiza-
tion by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed unusually
abundant and large vacuoles within the cytosol of Nf1Prx1 Ot. (Fig. 2D).
Many osteocytes also showed presence of immature collagen in the
perilacunar space.

Anatomical variation in the extent of osteocyte and canalicular network
changes in Nf1 deﬁcient bone

Analysis of the SEM micrographs revealed that morphological
changes of the Nf1Prx1 Ot. dendritic network were most striking in
the areas proximal to muscle attachment sites (Figs. 3A-B). Particularly
in the proximity of tuberositas tibiae and tuberositas medialis in the re-
gion E1 and E3 Ot. appeared misshaped and the canalicular network dis-
turbed. In contrast, much less severe were changes of Ot. morphology in
the area E2 which is located in the mid shaft bone. These data indicate
that Nf1 deﬁcient Ot. in the cortical bone show morphological changes
predominantly in the areas exposed to high mechanical load.

Osteocyte viability is not impaired in Nf1Prx1 bone

In order to check if Nf1 deﬁciency might be associated with Ot. apo-
ptosis or autophagy, we performed histological and molecular marker
analyses. We did not detect empty Ot. lacunae within Nf1Prx1 bone cor-
tices, which would be indicative of Ot. death (Fig. 4A). In line with this,
no TUNEL positive cells were detected within cortical bone (Fig. 4B) and
the levels of cleaved-PARP in cortical bone lysates were normal
(Fig. 4C). Levels of autophagy marker expression LC3AII and LC2BII
were also unaffected (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these data indicate that Ot.
viability is not impaired by Nf1 inactivation in bone.

Dysregulation of a subset of mineralization regulating genes in Nf1 deﬁcient
cortical bone

Neuroﬁbromin critically regulates Ras-MAPK signalling [25]. In line
with this implication, we detected increased activation of Ras, MEK1
and ERK1/2 in cortical bone lysates of Nf1Prx1 mice (Fig. 5A). Addition-
ally, we found increased activation of AMP activated protein kinase
(AMPK), which is a marker of ongoing energetic stress (Fig. 5A) [26].
Neither serum level of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein
(Mepe) nor its mRNA transcript level was signiﬁcantly deregulated
(Fig. 5B). Similarly, expression levels of Dmp1, E11/podoplanin, and
Sost were not altered in cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice as compared to
controls (Fig. 5B). However, expression of the Mgp gene, an osteoblast
and vessel expressed mineralization inhibitor, was signiﬁcantly in-
creased (Fig. 5B). Additionally, expression of Phex, known to be mutated
in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, was also increased [27]. System-
ic levels of osteoprotegerin (Opg) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand
(Rankl) were unaffected suggesting normal osteoblast-osteoclast cou-
pling (Fig. 5C). Similarly, normal level of the Ot. speciﬁc bone mineral
regulator Fgf23 indicate no systemic defect of mineral homeostasis.
Consistent with previous observations in Nf1Col1 mice [13], plasma
levels of osteocalcin (Ocn) and procollagen I N-terminal propeptide
(PINP), biomarkers of osteoblast activity, were approx. 2-fold increased

acrylate embedded humeri. Representative micrographs of cortical bone within the region E1, E2 and E3 in mutant and control mice revealed altered shape and orientation of Ot. lacuna in
Nf1Prx1 mice. (B) Humeri of Nf1Col1 mice showed normal overall shape. Note Ot. lacunae appear larger and rounder compared to controls. Scale bar represents 20 μm. (C) Histomorphometric
analysis of BSE images showed relative Ot. lacuna area (Ot.Ar/B.Ar) in Nf1Col1 (light blue) and Nf1Prx1 mice (red) and controls (dark blue and yellow, respectively). Ot. lacunae were distin-
guished from other pores by shape and size. The Ot.Ar/B.Ar is in all regions of interest (E1-E3) of Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice signiﬁcantly elevated compared to respective controls. (D) Ot. lacunae

Fig. 3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed altered osteocyte morphology in Nf1Prx1 humerus. Methacrylate embedded humeri were cross sectioned at indicated levels
(E1-E3), surface polished, etched with formic acid, and imaged with SEM. Comparable regions (a-c) of each level were selected for evaluation. (A) Ot. morphology and orientation varies
dependent on localization. In regions (E1a, E1c, E2a, E2c, E3c), where cortical bone has an orderly lamellar structure, the Ot. orientation follows circular orientation of bone matrix collagen.
Adjacent to muscle attachment sites Ot. are less orderly positioned (E1b, E2b, E3a, E3b) and appear rounder. (B) Nf1Prx1 Ot. are not oriented towards lamellar bone matrix structure in
areas exposed to mechanical forces (E1a, E2a, E3a). Cortical bone matrix in proximity of muscle attachment sites is unevenly etched in Nf1Prx1 mice (E1c, E3b). In these areas Ot. appear
irregularly distributed and have altered shaped. Scale bar represents 20 μm.

(Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results show a selective effect of Nf1 inactiva-
tion on the expression of a subgroup of genes involved in matrix mineral-
ization, but no global derangement of the Ot. homeostatic gene network:
Sost, Fgf23 and Dmp1.

Transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in energy derivation/storage
and downregulation of ECM synthesis marks energetic stress within Nf1
deﬁcient cortical bone

To gain more information about the molecular aspects of the ob-
served phenotype, we analysed transcriptional proﬁles of Nf1 deﬁcient

bones using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST microarrays. Gene expres-
sion proﬁling was done for four mutant and four control animals, and
the signiﬁcant gene regulations determined with one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). We detected 565 signiﬁcantly upregulated and 535
downregulated uniquely identiﬁed (DAVID-ID) genes in Nf1Col1 corti-
cal bone samples (cut-off: p ≤ 0.01) and 672 signiﬁcantly upregulated
and 235 downregulated transcripts (cut-off: p ≤ 0.02) in Nf1Prx1 corti-
cal bone samples (Tables S3-8). These signiﬁcantly regulated genes
were subjected to classiﬁcation and gene class enrichment analysis
[28]. Common functional groups among upregulated genes in both
models were: GO:0017076 ~ purine nucleotide binding Nf1Col1 - 88

mice. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired Student t-test, * p ≤ 0.05 ** p ≤ 0.01.(D) Transcriptional ﬁngerprints of Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 bone tissue (only cortical bone)
were achieved with Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Genes represent functional groups enriched among upregulated and downregulated transcripts in both Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1
model according to DAVID annotation tool analysis (see also results and supplemental tables). Upregulation (red), downregulation (blue), genes signiﬁcantly deregulated are shown in

In both mouse models this was paralleled by downregulation of
genes of the following GO categories: GO:0031012 ~ extracellular ma-
trix (Nf1Col1 - 62 genes, p = 1.96-32; Nf1Prx1 - 14 genes, p = 7.13-5);
GO:0005581 ~ collagen (Nf1Col1 - 8 genes, p = 9.25-7; Nf1Prx1 - 9
genes, p = 5.44-6); GO:0015629 ~ actin cytoskeleton (Nf1Col1 - 19
genes, p = 6.59-5; Nf1Prx1- 13 genes, p = 5.27-6); GO:0007155 ~ cell
adhesion (Nf1Col1 - 63, p = 8.84-22; Nf1Prx1- 17 genes, p = 5.06-4);
GO:0050954 ~ sensory perception of mechanical stimulus (Nf1Col1
- 5 genes, p = 0.24; Nf1Prx1- 6 genes, p = 0.003); GO:0048839
~ inner ear development (Nf1Col1 - 8 genes, p = 0.009; Nf1Prx1- 4
genes, p = 0.07); GO:0003774 ~ motor activity (Nf1Col1 - 14 genes,
p = 1.09-4; Nf1Prx1- 11 genes, p = 4.03-6) (Table S5, S7). Additionally,
in both models some genes belonging to the GO:0050954 ~ sensory
perception of mechanical stimulus were upregulated (e.g. Myo7a
and Cdh23). Moreover, the endothelial marker 7 (Tem7/Plxdc1) that is
highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells was upregulated in Nf1Prx1
and Nf1Col1 bones (Fig. 5D). Thus, transcriptional proﬁles of Nf1Prx1
and Nf1Col1 bones share increased expression of genes involved in
nutrient supply, energy derivation and energy storage. Commonly
down-regulated genes are involved in matrix synthesis as well as
in cytoskeleton organization. Dysregulated expression of genes known
to be crucially involved in mechanosensory cilia function (e.g. Ush and
Kif genes) points to derangement of the osteocytic mechanosensory
system in Nf1 deﬁcient bone.

Discussion

Deregulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity in Nf1 deﬁcient
bone yield a high-turnover phenotype, reduced bone mass and low
bone mineral content [13,14,29,30]. Detailed structural analysis
revealed increased micro-porosity in Nf1Col1 and Nf1Prx1 cortical
bones, which was due to increased osteocyte lacunae size but not oste-
ocyte number [16]. However, no histological or molecular data were
available to support the role of osteocytes in the NF1 bone pathology.
Here, we show that osteocyte lacunae are not only enlarged but also
misshaped (more spherical) upon loss of neuroﬁbromin. Additionally,
the canalicular network appears disorganized especially in proximity
of muscle attachment sites. The altered shape of osteocyte lacunae and
subcellular organization point towards perturbation of the cytoskeleton
as main determinant of cellular morphology. This conclusion is likely as
neuroﬁbromin was recently shown to control two signalling pathways
responsible for regulation of actin cytoskeleton: Rho-ROCK-LIMK2-
Coﬁlin [31], and Rac1-Pak1-LIMK1-Coﬁlin [32]. In this study we detect-
ed increased activity of canonical MAPK signalling in cortical bone
lysates. We also showed enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK, which is
activated by decreasing concentrations of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and increasing AMP/ADP concentrations thus being an indicator
of an ongoing energetic stress [33]. In line with the energetic stress hy-
pothesis, we detected in Nf1 deﬁcient bones increased expression of
genes encoding purin-binding proteins and lysosomal proteins involved
in energy derivation. In both Nf1Col and Nf1Prx1 bone tissue, this was
further complemented by an increased expression of lipid metabolism
genes suggesting that Nf1 deﬁcient bone cells undergo metabolic rear-
rangement. Additionally, downregulation of multiple genes involved
in the mechanosensory apparatus and cytoskeletal function suggest
that the cortical bone mechanosensory function is also affected by Nf1
inactivation.

None of the osteocyte speciﬁc genes, with exception of Phex that is
expressed both in osteocytes and osteoblasts, were signiﬁcantly
deregulated in Nf1Prx1 cortical bone tissue. This suggest that observed
changes might in fact mostly be related to the defective osteoblast-
osteocyte transition rather than a primary osteocyte dysfunction. In
support of these observations, many osteocytes appeared immersed in
the immature collagen which was deposited within the perilacunar
space (TEM). This phenotype is reminiscent of excessive collagen syn-
thesis by osteoblasts and is paralleled by a global, likely compensatory,

transcriptional downregulation of matrix gene expression. We also
think that transcriptional upregulation of Phex, a gene known to coun-
teract osteoidosis in Hyp mice, might be a compensatory effect [34].
Normal levels of the mineralization regulating factor Fgf23 in Nf1Prx1
plasma strengthen the idea that osteocytes are not the primary cause
of the defect. Changes in osteocytes rather reﬂect the end stage of
perturbed osteoblast differentiation. Thus, while Nf1Prx1 mice demon-
strate an osteomalatic phenotype the overall phenotype is clearly
distinct from the osteomalacia found in mice bearing Fgf23, Dmp1 and
Phex gene inactivation [9,35]. The fact that we did not detect empty os-
teocyte lacunae (lacunae contained nuclei) demonstrated normal oste-
ocyte viability. This was conﬁrmed by negative results of the TUNEL
assay and a normal PARP and LCII cleavage status. Increased micro-
porosity due to enlarged osteocyte lacuna size contributes to deﬁciency
of mechanical resistance in Nf1Prx1 bone tissue [16]. Unexpectedly,
increased osteocyte size is likely attributed to improper cellular differ-
entiation rather than a lacuna mineralization defect (normal mineral
gradient around osteocyte lacunae). This conclusion is in line with
unaffected Fgf23, Dmp1 and Phex levels in Nf1Prx1 bone tissue.
Hyperosteoidosis in NF1 is likely due to imbalanced organic matrix mat-
uration and subsequent mineralization [13,14,16,29]. However, very
large mineralization lesions within Nf1Prx1 long bone diaphysis are
likely caused by an interplay of persistent blood vessels, improper
bone matrix quality and high mechanical loads [16]. The deltoid tuber-
osity in Nf1Prx1 and to a lesser degree in Nf1Col1 humerus is mal-
formed [16]. This suggests that the site-speciﬁc effects at the ligament
to bone insertion site, affecting chondrocyte and osteoblast develop-
ment, might impact periosteal function rather than mechanical loading
itself. If osteocytes act as a local ampliﬁer of these effects awaits further
analysis.

Loss of Nf1 in mesenchymal progenitor cells (Nf1Prx1 mice)
produces a complex phenotype resulting in deﬁcient long bone growth,
tubular bone bowing, hip joint fusion, defective growth plate function,
blood vessels persistence within the bone cortex, and muscle dystrophy
[14,16,17]. A much milder bone phenotype, mainly characterized by
hyperosteoidosis and high bone turnover, is observed in Nf1Col1 mice
in which ablation of Nf1 is restricted to bone forming cells and occurs
at the pre-osteoblast stage [13]. Our current view of the NF1 bone
pathology, based on the analysis of growth plate chondrocyte, osteo-
blast and osteoclast dysfunction, is that increased bone turnover and
an imbalance between extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and miner-
alization cause the NF1 skeletal manifestations [13,14,16,17,29,30]. Re-
cently, in depth structural analysis of Nf1Prx1 mice suggested a critical
role of the blood vessel system for the full NF1 pathology [16]. Here
we demonstrate that Nf1 ablation has a developmental impact also on
osteocytes. Importantly, morphological alterations of osteocytes are
more pronounced in Nf1Prx1 rather than Nf1Col1 bone tissue. Thus
NF1 inactivation in mesenchymal progenitor cells, affecting mesenchy-
mal tissue development, ab initio causes more pronounce changes to
osteocyte development then the inactivation later in osteoblasts. This
is likely due to a vital role which Nf1 plays in early osteoblast lineage dif-
ferentiation and/or inﬂuence of other mesenchymal tissues including
blood vessels and muscles [13,14,17,36].

Some aspects of our molecular analysis likely relate to the increased
presence of blood vessels in the cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice [16]. A
possible hint towards the molecular mechanism of the blood vessel
associated bone lesions is the upregulation of Mgp in Nf1Prx1 bones.
Mgp is a potent mineralization inhibitor expressed by osteoblasts and
endothelial cells and its expression is regulated by phosphate in a
MAPK dependent manner [37]. The involvement of Mgp in Nf1Prx1 corti-
cal bone pathogenesis seems likely as Mgp knock-out causes vessel calci-
ﬁcation and Mgp overexpression in osteoblasts results in hyperosteoidosis
similar to the one observed in Nf1Prx1 mice [38]. It appears also likely that
changes in the properties of Nf1 deﬁcient vessels themselves contribute to
defective bone mineralization. In support of this, Tem7/Plxdc1, a tumour
endothelial marker expressed also by osteosarcoma cells, was among

162

the upregulated genes in Nf1 deﬁcient bones [39]. Increased expression of
Tem7/Plxdc1 suggests that blood vessels in Nf1Prx1 bones have tumor-
like properties [40] and might develop altered blood vessel barrier and
diffusion properties [41]. This hypothesis awaits future experimental ver-
iﬁcation. Importantly, this study reveals that osteocytes, which are the
most abundant cell type within cortical bone, are critically affected by
the loss of neuroﬁbromin. Morphological features as well as gene ex-
pression changes indicate perturbed cytoskeletal function, changes in
energetic metabolism and altered extracellular matrix properties. We
conclude that neuroﬁbromin is required for mesenchymal lineage devel-
opment and its inactivation hinders normal osteocyte development.
