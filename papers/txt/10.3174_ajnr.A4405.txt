ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate imaging correlates to the changes occurring during angio-
genesis in gliomas. This was accomplished through in vivo assessment of vascular parameters (relative CBV and permeability surface-area
product) and their changing relationship with increasing glioma grade.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with gliomas underwent preoperative perfusion CT and assessment of relative CBV
and permeability surface-area product. Regression analyses were performed to assess the rate of change between relative CBV and
permeability surface-area product and to test whether these differed for distinct glioma grades. The ratio of relative CBV to permeability
surface-area product was also computed and compared among glioma grades by using analysis of variance methods.

RESULTS: The rate of change in relative CBV with respect to permeability surface-area product was highest for grade II gliomas followed
by grade III and then grade IV (1.64 versus 0.91 versus 0.27, respectively). The difference in the rate of change was signiﬁcant between grade
III and IV (P ⫽ .003) and showed a trend for grades II and IV (P ⫽ .098). Relative CBV/permeability surface-area product ratios were the
highest for grade II and lowest for grade IV. The pair-wise difference among all 3 groups was signiﬁcant (P ⬍ .001).

CONCLUSIONS: There is an increase in relative CBV more than permeability surface-area product in lower grade gliomas, whereas in
grade III and especially grade IV gliomas, permeability surface-area product increases much more than relative CBV. The rate of change of
relative CBV with respect to permeability surface-area product and relative CBV/permeability surface-area product ratio can serve as an
imaging correlate to changes occurring at the tumor microvasculature level.

Gliomas have a complex and heterogeneous vasculature, rely-

ing on angiogenesis to maintain an adequate blood supply.1,2
Development of in vivo imaging methods capable of providing
insight into this process is critical for better understanding of
tumor biology and, more important, the changes occurring at the
microvasculature level. Perfusion imaging is one noninvasive
method that can provide information about tumor vasculature.
Two of the most commonly measured vascular parameters by
using perfusion imaging are tumor blood volume and tumor vas-
cular leakiness. It has been shown that both tumor blood volume
and leakiness correlate with different aspects of vascular histol-

ogy3 and, hence, may change at different rates as the tumor trans-
forms to a higher grade.4 Tumor blood volume (cerebral blood
volume) is known to be a surrogate marker of microvascular at-
tenuation and, hence, total tumor vascularity.5-11 On the other
hand, permeability surface-area product (PS) is a measure of leak-
age of contrast agent from the intravascular to extravascular com-
partment and is a measure of the leakiness of tumor vasculature.
Another commonly stated parameter of vascular leakage is the
forward transfer constant (Ktrans); because blood flow is usually
very fast in high-grade leaky brain tumors, Ktrans approximates
PS.12 PS has been shown to correlate with microvascular cellular
proliferation and, therefore, may be a surrogate marker for angio-
genesis.3,13 Both of these parameters have also been shown to
correlate very well with glioma grading.3,4,12,14,15 Low-grade glio-
mas start recruiting native vessels by co-option.16-18 However,
with increasing tumor growth and grade, metabolic demand in-
creases, leading to tissue hypoxia, which, in turn, induces angio-
genesis.16,17,19-21 Angiogenesis is a multifactorial complex cas-
cade of structural changes in native vessels and neovessels, which

is dependent on a number of pro- and antiangiogenic signaling
pathways and molecules, the balance of which is tilted to proan-
giogenesis by a number of factors including hypoxia.22-24

The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to show how
relative CBV (rCBV) and PS changes occurring in different World
Health Organization grades of gliomas can provide an insight into
the glioma angiogenesis and, hence, would support the histologic
knowledge base already available through an in vivo imaging
technique, such as perfusion imaging. We hypothesized that
rCBV and PS changes occur at different rates in different grades of
gliomas and that the ratio of rCBV/PS will replicate how the vas-
culature changes and the “angiogenic switch” occur at the micro-
vascular level, which are in response to overexpression of proan-
giogenic stimuli as the gliomas transform from a lower grade to a
higher grade neoplasm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Our study is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act– compliant, and approval was obtained from the institutional
review board. The first author had control of the data and all other
information being submitted for publication. Seventy-six treat-
ment-naïve patients with glioma who underwent perfusion CT
(PCT) were included in this study (44 men and 32 women with an
age range from 22 to 81 years; mean age, 53 years). Of those pa-
tients, 45 had World Health Organization grade IV, 18 had grade
III, and 13 had grade II gliomas proved by histopathology. PCT
was performed between 1 and 7 days before surgery (surgical re-
section, n ⫽ 54; biopsy, n ⫽ 22). Before the PCT was performed,
37.7% of the patients with grade IV and 27.7% of those with grade
III were on a stable dose of steroids. All lesions were confirmed
histologically according to World Health Organization criteria by
a board-certified neuropathologist who was blinded to the PCT
results. Subsets of this patient population have been published in
the past with a research focus not presented in the current
article.3,14,15

CT Perfusion Technique and Perfusion Map Analysis
The CT perfusion tracer kinetics theory has been described well in
multiple previous publications.12,25-29 A low-radiation-dose non-
contrast CT head study was performed to localize the ROI before
obtaining a perfusion scan. For the perfusion scan, 50 mL of non-
ionic contrast was injected at a rate of 4 –5 mL/s through an IV line
by using an automatic power injector. At 5 seconds into the injec-
tion, a cine (continuous) scan was initiated with the following
technique: 80 kV(peak), 100 –120 mA, and 1 second per rotation
for a duration of 50 seconds by using a 64-section CT scanner
(VCT; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). After the initial
50-second cine scan, 8 more axial images were acquired, 1 image
every 15 seconds for an additional 2 minutes, thus giving a total
acquisition time of 170 seconds to assess delayed permeability.12
Eight 5-mm-thick axial sections were acquired, resulting in a total
coverage area of 4 cm and a mean effective radiation dose of 2.8 –
3.5 mSv. The superior sagittal sinus was used as the venous output
function, and the artery with the greatest peak and slope on time-
attenuation curves, as the arterial input function. An ROI was
drawn within the confines of a large vessel, and the automatic

function of the software selects the pixels with greatest peak and
slope on the time-attenuation curve for analysis. Perfusion maps
of CBV and PS were generated by using a 2-compartment model
(Advantage Windows workstation by using CT perfusion 3.0 soft-
ware; GE Healthcare) in all patients by a neuroradiologist with at
least 9 years of experience. ROIs were drawn manually on the PCT
parametric maps, including the whole solid and enhancing lesion
on multiple axial images covering the whole lesion. We drew
ROIs, taking care to exclude necrotic/cystic parts or calcified por-
tions of the lesion and to avoid any major cortical vessels.3,14,15
Corresponding contrast-enhanced MR images were also reviewed
in detail to avoid any necrotic/cystic regions while placing ROIs. A
second ROI was placed over the normal-appearing white matter
in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere and opposite pole as far
away from the tumor as possible. Mean absolute values of PS and
rCBV obtained by using normal-appearing white matter as the
denominator in each case were used for final analysis.

Vascular Leakiness: Permeability Surface-Area Product
PS characterizes diffusion of the contrast agent from the intravas-
cular compartment into the interstitial/extravascular space due to
a deficient blood-brain barrier and is used as a means of quanti-
fying the “leakiness” of the vasculature.12 Permeability is related
to the diffusion coefficient of contrast agent in the assumed water-
filled pores of the capillary endothelium. The diffusion flux of
contrast agent across the capillary endothelium is dependent on
both the diffusion coefficient and total surface area of the pores.
PS is computed from the impulse residue function, which de-
creases exponentially with time.

In physiologic terms, PS is the rate at which contrast agent
flows into the extravascular tissues and has the same dimensions
as flow (milliliters/100 g/minute). It is related to another com-
monly stated parameter of vascular leakage, Ktrans, by the
following:

Ktrans ⫽ E ⫻ F,

where Ktrans is the transfer constant with, again, the same dimen-
sions as flow (unit commonly used, minute⫺1).12

Statistical Analysis
Correlations (Pearson correlation coefficients) between PS and
rCBV were computed for patients within each of the World
Health Organization glioma grades (II, III, and IV) to assess the
association between the 2 measures. These individual correlations
were then compared among the 3 groups of patients by using
methods developed for testing independent correlation coeffi-
cients to investigate any potential differences in associations.30
Beyond associations, we were interested in assessing a measure of
the rate of change of rCBV with respect to PS within each of 3
glioma groups. Regression methods were used to assess these rates
of change with a regression model computed for the each of the
glioma groups by using rCBV as the dependent variable and PS as
the independent model. Within the regression analyses, the
slopes, which are a measure of the rate of change, for the 3 glioma
groups were compared. In addition to the rate of change deter-
mined by regression methods, we considered the ratio of rCBV to
PS as a measure of the relationship between the 2 imaging mea-

sures and a patient. This new measure was computed for each
patient by dividing the rCBV measures by PS. The differences in
these ratios for the 3 glioma groups were compared by using anal-
ysis of variance methods with pair-wise comparisons. All testing
was done at the .05 level. Data analyses were conducted by using
SAS, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

rCBV was positively correlated with the PS for all 3 glioma
groups (P ⬍ .05 for all, Table 1). The correlations were high for

Rate of Change of rCBV with Respect to PS
The rate of change (ie, slopes) of rCBV with respect to PS (Fig 1)
was highest for the grade II gliomas and lowest for the grade IV
gliomas, with grade III gliomas falling between the other 2. The
rate of change in rCBV with respect to PS was ⬎2 for grade II
gliomas and ⬍0.5 for grade IV gliomas (Table 2). The rate of
change of grade III gliomas was 1.3, and when we compared these
rates of change, the difference between grades III and IV was sig-
nificant (P ⫽ .001), while the difference between grades II and IV
showed a trend (P ⫽ .095). The difference in the rate of change
between grades II and III was not significant (P ⫽ .423) (Table 3).

rCBV/PS Ratios and Glioma Grade
As with the rate of change of rCBV with respect to PS, the average
rCBV/PS ratio was highest for grade II gliomas followed by grade

3.26 for grade II gliomas down to 1.41 for grade IV gliomas (Table
4). This linear decrease was significant between each adjacent gli-
oma group and between grade II and IV glioma groups (P ⬍ .001
for all).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated the interplay between the 2 most
commonly measured tumor vascular imaging parameters (ie, tu-
mor blood volume [rCBV] and tumor vascular leakiness [PS])
and how this could help improve our understanding of tumor
angiogenesis and vascular phenotypes of different glioma grades.
We demonstrated that these 2 parameters are correlated but do
not necessarily increase in tandem with increasing glioma grade
(Fig 3) and, therefore, correlate with different aspects of tumor
vasculature and angiogenesis. Their relationship as assessed non-
invasively by imaging in the current study demonstrates that in
World Health Organization grade II gliomas, initially there is an
increase in rCBV more than PS, suggestive of increasing micro-
vascular density, but predominantly an increase in nonleaky ves-
sels, most likely due to vessel co-option and intussusception.
Whereas, in grade III and especially grade IV gliomas, PS increases
much more than rCBV, this suggests that the increasing number
of vessels now contains predominantly leaky vessels, which are
reflective of increased proangiogenic expression due to tumor
hypoxia. Grade III gliomas demonstrate an increase in both rCBV
and PS compared with grade II gliomas, and this probably repre-
sents a stage corresponding to “angiogenic switch,” in which
lower grade tumors cannot simply continue growing by recruiting
more native vessels and co-option and so also develop tissue hyp-
oxia, which turns on angiogenesis by increased expression of
proangiogenic stimuli and factors.

Interest in the concept of angiogenesis in tumor growth in-
creased in the early 1960s and has continued to expand during the

FIG 3. World Health Organization grade III glioma. A, Representative postcontrast T1-weighted axial MR image shows a large solid tumor with
heterogeneous areas of enhancement. Corresponding CT perfusion CBV (B) and PS (C) maps show marked heterogeneity in different segments
of the tumor (eg, ROI 5 shows markedly increased CBV) but not very high PS; and on the contrary, ROI 3 shows a marked increase of PS, but not
very high CBV. This case is an example of a markedly heterogeneous tumor (as seen on postcontrast MR images), and this markedly heteroge-
neous imaging appearance could be due to the underlying complexity of angiogenesis. Some of this heterogeneity could be explained by a very
complex interplay of CBV and PS, and these two parameters probably do not increase in perfect tandem.

past 5 decades, spearheaded by researchers such as Folkman1 and
Folkman et al.2 It has been shown convincingly that growth of
new capillary blood vessels or angiogenesis is required for growth
of solid tumors and metastasis.1,2,31-33 Tumor growth starts as an
avascular mass, especially in well-perfused tissues like brain and
lung.34,35 Tumor cells can grow along existing vessels without
invoking an angiogenic response. This process has been defined as
vessel co-option. Initial co-opted vessels undergo dramatic re-
gression as a host defense mechanism with tumor cell death in the
center of the tumor.16,17,20,36 However, the remaining tumor cells
are rescued by robust angiogenesis at the periphery of the tumor.
Angiogenesis has also been proposed to be required by in situ
tumors to convert from low metastatic activity or a quiescent
phenotype to an aggressive or invasive phenotype.37,38 This con-
version and acquisition of angiogenic properties have also been
referred to as “angiogenic switch.”39,40

Intussusceptive and sprouting angiogenesis are 2 known ma-
jor types of angiogenesis based on how the new vessels are
formed.41 Intussusceptive angiogenesis, also known as “splitting
angiogenesis,” involves formation of blood vessels by a splitting
process in which elements of interstitial tissues invade existing
vessels, forming transvascular tissue pillars that expand. This pro-
cess requires reorganization of existing endothelial cells and does
not rely on immediate endothelial proliferation or migration.
Sprouting angiogenesis is characterized by sprouts composed of
endothelial cells, which usually grow toward an angiogenic stim-
ulus such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A.42 Sprouting
angiogenesis can therefore add blood vessels to portions of tissues
previously devoid of blood vessels, particularly in response to tis-
sue hypoxia. It is probably difficult to differentiate these types of
angiogenesis apart from a very detailed and high-resolution his-
tologic assessment, and most likely these processes have a com-
plex relationship. However, it appears that sprouting angiogene-
sis is most likely associated with more immature and leaky
neovessels in response to tissue hypoxia and increased production
of vascular endothelial growth factor–related complexes.

This whole process of recruiting native vessels (co-option) to
the formation of neovessels (intussusceptive and sprouting angio-
genesis) is essential for tumor growth and can, in fact, occur as
gliomas transform from low to higher grades. Perfusion imaging
provides information about tumor vasculature noninvasively.
Two of the important vascular parameters assessed by in vivo
techniques include tumor blood volume and tumor vascular leak-
iness. Tumor blood volume has been shown to be a surrogate
marker of microvascular attenuation in various kinds of cancers
but is not able to differentiate native vessels and neovessels. Tu-
mor vascular leakiness, on the other hand, is a marker of predom-
inantly neovessels, which are leaky and immature and, therefore,
probably represent sites of active angiogenesis. It has been shown
to correlate with microvascular endothelial proliferation, in-
creased vascular endothelial growth factor expression,3 and also
proangiogenic gene expression.43 Tumor blood volume and leak-
iness measures are 2 different imaging parameters that have a
specific physiologic basis but result from a very complex multistep
process and, therefore to some degree, are interrelated.

One of the major limitations of the current study is its retro-
spective nature, apart from the small sample size, especially with

respect to grade II and III gliomas. A prospective study with a
larger sample size and ideally different histologic-grade tumor
specimens obtained from the same patient or multiple imaging
studies and tissue samples obtained with longitudinal analysis in
patients who show lower to higher grade malignant transforma-
tion (during multiple years of follow-up) will be needed to con-
firm our results and interpretation.

CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that vascular changes and angiogenesis
occurring with increasing glioma grade can be evaluated nonin-
vasively by using in vivo perfusion imaging techniques. This find-
ing not only adds to our knowledge of angiogenesis but provides a
much deeper understanding of the physiologic basis of the com-
monly used vascular imaging parameters. It could make better
integration of these imaging parameters in routine clinical use
easier and, hence, take them another step closer to being potential
biomarkers, which would provide not only important diagnostic
and prognostic information but also useful predictive biomark-
ers, especially with the emergence of antiangiogenic therapy
regimens.
