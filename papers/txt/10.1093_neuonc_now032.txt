Background. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex plays a pivotal role in protein translation initiation; however, its
importance in malignant and benign Schwann cell tumors has not been explored, and whether blocking eIF4F function is effective
for treating these tumors is not known.

Methods. Immunostaining was performed on human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and vestibular schwan-
nomas (VSs) for eIF4F components. The role of eIF4A and eIF4E in cell growth was assessed by RNA interference. Various natural
compounds were screened for their growth-inhibitory activity. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed to charac-
terize the action of silvestrol, and its antitumor activity was veriﬁed in orthotopic mouse models.

Results. MPNSTs and VSs frequently overexpressed eIF4A, eIF4E, and/or eIF4G. Depletion of eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4E substan-
tially reduced MPNST cell growth. From screening a panel of plant-derived compounds, the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol was identiﬁed
as a leading agent with nanomolar IC50 values in MPNST and VS cells. Silvestrol induced G2/M arrest in both NF1-deﬁcient and NF1-
expressing MPNST cells and primary VS cells. Silvestrol consistently decreased the levels of multiple cyclins, Aurora A, and mito-
genic kinases AKT and ERKs. Silvestrol treatment dramatically suppressed tumor growth in mouse models for NF12/2 MPNST and
Nf22/2 schwannoma. This decreased tumor growth was accompanied by elevated phospho-histone H3 and TUNEL labeling, con-
sistent with G2/M arrest and apoptosis in silvestrol-treated tumor cells.
Conclusions. The eIF4F complex is a potential therapeutic target in MPNSTs and VS, and silvestrol may be a promising agent for
treating these tumors.

Translation initiation is the key rate-limiting step for protein bio-
synthesis and involves recruitment of the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4F (eIF4F) complex to the 5′ cap of mRNA.1 This complex
is composed of eIF4E, which binds the 5′ cap, eIF4A, an RNA
helicase that unwinds the secondary structure of the 5′ region
of mRNA, and eIF4G, which functions as a scaffold for other
eIFs and enhances the helicase activity of eIF4A. Studies have

suggested that oncogenesis is driven by uncontrolled protein
translation. Constitutive activation of oncogenic kinases (eg,
AKT, mTOR and ERK1/2) are frequently activated in human
tumors. These kinases inhibit the 4E-BP translational repres-
sors, facilitating eIF4F assembly and leading to elevated protein
synthesis.2 Also, AKT and ERK phosphorylate eIF4B, thereby in-
creasing eIF4A’s helicase activity. In addition, overexpression of

eIF4F components frequently occurs during tumorigenesis.
High levels of eIF4E are observed in several cancer types and
often correlate with tumor grade, metastasis, and poor sur-
vival.3 While the expression status of eIF4G and eIF4A has
been less well-characterized, ampliﬁcation of eIF4G has been
reported in squamous lung carcinomas.2 Of the 2 members
of eIF4A that can form the eIF4F complex, increased eIF4A1 ex-
pression has been found in liver, cervical, and breast cancers.2,4
Additionally, the enforced expression of eIF4A accelerates
leukemogenesis.5

AKT and ERK1/2 are commonly activated in malignant pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and their activation is
important for tumor growth. MPNSTs are aggressive tumors
that arise along peripheral nerves and are primarily composed
of neoplastic Schwann cells.6 With no effective treatment cur-
rently available, patients with MPNSTs have a poor 5-year sur-
vival of only 20�50%. MPNSTs occur sporadically or as part of
the genetic syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is
caused by mutations in the NF1/neuroﬁbromin gene.7 The mu-
tational loss of NF1 constitutively activates the Ras pathway, re-
sulting in deregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling. The
NF1-associated MPNSTs often develop in association with a pre-
existing benign plexiform neuroﬁbroma, representing malig-
nant transformation of benign tumor cells.8 Sporadic MPNSTs
likewise exhibit elevated ERK and AKT signaling due to multiple
genetic lesions such as EGFR ampliﬁcation and PTEN loss.6

Activated AKT and ERK1/2 also drive the growth of benign
Schwann cell tumors, vestibular schwannomas (VSs), which
cause signiﬁcant morbidities such as hearing loss, facial nerve
paralysis, brainstem compression, hydrocephalus, and death.
VS can occur sporadically or in patients with NF2, which is
caused by inactivation of the NF2/merlin gene.9,10 The loss of
merlin function results in the abnormal activation of receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and PI3K. Consequently, these tumors
have high levels of activated AKT and ERKs.11 Merlin has also
been reported to associate with and inhibit eIF3c, suggesting
a link to the control of protein translation.12 An FDA-approved
medical therapy is not currently available for the treatment of
VS. As activation of AKT and ERK in VS and MPNSTs can drive en-
hanced protein translation, inhibiting the protein translational
machinery might be a viable means for treating these tumors.
Recently, the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol has received consider-
able attention since it possesses a nanomolar cytotoxic poten-
cy against hematological malignancies, colorectal carcinoma,
and hepatocellular carcinoma.13 – 17 It also exhibits an overall
favorable pharmacokinetic proﬁle in mice18 and has been
under preclinical evaluation in the NCI Experimental Therapeu-
tics (NExT) Program (http://next.cancer.gov/about/pipeline_
preclinical.htm; last access 29 February 2016). Silvestrol binds
to and inhibits eIF4A1/2, preventing the formation of the
eIF4F complex19 – 21; however, the antitumor effects of silvestrol
in MPNSTs and VS have not been investigated.

In this study, we demonstrated frequent overexpression of
eIF4F components in MPNSTs and VS and identified silvestrol
from a natural compound screen as the most potent
growth-inhibitory agent in both tumors. Silvestrol causes G2/M
arrest and reduces several cyclins and key signaling kinases.
Signiﬁcantly, it efﬁciently inhibits tumor growth and induces ap-
optosis in orthotopic NF12/2 MPNST and Nf22/2 schwannoma
animal models.

Materials and Methods
Tissue Acquisition and Cell Cultures
The Ohio State University IRB approved the human subject
protocols for the acquisition of normal nerves and tumor
specimens after informed patient consent. Primary VS and
Schwann cells were prepared and propagated as previously de-
scribed.22 ST8814 and STS26T MPNST and luciferase-expressing
ST8814-Luc and Sch10545-Luc cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum. More details are found in Supplementary Methods.

Lentiviral-mediated Short-hairpin RNA Knockdown
MPNST cells were plated in 6-well plates at 9000 cells/well. The
following day, cells were fed with fresh medium containing
8 mg/mL polybrene and infected with MISSION short-hairpin
(sh)RNA lentiviral particles (Sigma) targeting EIF4A1, EIF4A2,
EIF4E (Supplementary Table S1), or a non-targeting control
(#SHC002V) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Two
days later, transduced cells were selected with 2.5 mg/mL puro-
mycin for 6–7 days prior to cell counting and Western blotting.
Densitometric analysis of the protein band intensities was per-
formed using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html; last
access 29 February 2016) and computed as a percentage of the
nontargeting control after normalizing to a-tubulin or GAPDH.

Natural Compound Treatment, Cell Proliferation Assays,
and Flow Cytometry
A panel of 23 natural compounds (Supplementary Table S2)
was puriﬁed as part of a multi-institutional program for the dis-
covery of new anticancer agents from plants, and their full
structures and absolute conﬁgurations were established.15,23
Puriﬁed compounds were dissolved to 1�10 mM stocks in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). To evaluate the antiproliferative ef-
fects of these compounds, cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at 4000 cells/well except for primary VS and Schwann cells (10
000 cells/well). The following day, cells were treated with vari-
ous concentrations of each compound or DMSO as a control.
After 3 days, cell proliferation was assessed, and the IC50
value was calculated.24 Cell cycle analysis was performed ac-
cordingly24 (Supplementary Methods).

Orthotopic Animal Models, Bioluminescence Imaging,
and Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Nation-
wide Children’s Hospital approved this animal study. Under an-
esthesia, blunt dissection of the biceps femoris was used to
localize the sciatic nerves,25 which were injected with 2×104
ST8814-Luc or 1×106 Sch10545-Luc cells using a Hamilton
Neuros syringe attached with a 33-gauge needle. Following
tumor establishment,24 mice were randomized into 2 groups
(n ¼ 6 each) and were treated with either 1.5 mg/kg of silvestrol
or 30% hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) as the vehicle
control by i.p. injection (every other day). Tumor growth was
monitored weekly by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using a
Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (Caliper).24 Also, tumor xenografts

were imaged by MRI at the beginning and end of the experi-
ment, and tumor volumes were computed from T1-weighted
images.11,26

Western Blots and Immunohistochemistry
Subconﬂuent cells were treated with the indicated doses of sil-
vestrol for 24 hours and then lysed in Laemmli buffer contain-
ing 2% SDS. Normal nerve and VS tissues were homogenized
in lysis buffer using pellet pestles (Kontes). The total protein
content in cleared lysates was quantitated using the microBCA
assay (Thermo). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to pol-
yvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes.

Normal human nerve, MPNST, and VS tissue sections were
processed and immunostained as described previously.24
Also, following the last imaging session, ST8814-Luc and

Sch10545-Luc tumors in mice with or without silvestrol
treatment were harvested and stained with hematoxylin and
immunostained for p-histone H3(Ser10)
eosin (H&E) or
(Abcam) or TUNEL using the TMR Red In Situ Cell Death Detec-
tion Kit (Roche). Further details for Western blots and immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) are found in Supplementary Methods.

Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact test was used to determine if the staining inten-
sities of eIF4A, eIF4E, or eIF4G within VS specimens differed be-
tween solid and cystic tumors or between sporadic and NF2
diagnoses. A similar analysis was performed for MPNST specimens
for sporadic versus NF1 tumors. Two-tailed Student t tests were
used to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of growth inhibition
following eIF4A and eIF4E depletion in MPNST cells.

Results
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors and Vestibular
Schwannomas Frequently Overexpress the Components
of the eIF4F Complex
To examine the expression levels of eIF4F components, we
immunostained tissue sections of 19 MPNST, 20 VSs, and 2
normal nerve specimens for eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. The

majority of MPNSTs showed more intense labeling of all 3
eIF4F components than normal nerve tissues, which had
only barely detectable labeling (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Table S3). Prominent eIF4A staining was detected in the cyto-
plasm of MPNST cells and was particularly concentrated at
speciﬁc locations near the nucleus, suggesting localization
to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Consistent with its functions in protein translation

Fig. 2. Depletion of eIF4A and eIF4E inhibits proliferation of STS26T and ST8814 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells. Western
blotting of protein lysates prepared from STS26T and ST8814 MPNST cells and primary vestibular schwannomas (VSs) and Schwann cells (A) and
from normal nerve and VS tissues (B) was performed and probed for various eIF4F components. GAPDH or a-tubulin served as a loading control.
Densitometry was used to estimate the fold-difference in protein expression between VS and normal nerve tissues. (C) STS26T cells were
transduced with 10 MOI of the indicated lentiviral shRNA vectors, selected with puromycin, and counted. Shown are % cell numbers relative to
the nontargeting (NT) control designated as 100%. Means and SDs were calculated from 2 independent experiments. (D) Following counting, cells
were lysed, and equal amounts of protein lysates were probed for eIF4A1/2, eIF4E, and a-tubulin. The % decrease in eIF4A or eIF4E protein levels in
the indicated shRNA-transduced cells versus NT controls is shown. (E) ST8814 cells were transduced with the indicated lentiviral shRNA vectors and
counted after puromycin selection. (F) Protein lysates from transduced cells were probed for various eIF4F components and AKT. Statistics for cell
counting in (C) and (E) were performed using the 2-sample t test assuming unequal variances (*P , .05, **P ¼ .01, #P ¼ .001 vs NT controls).
and mRNA export,27 eIF4E exhibited both cytoplasmic and
nuclear localization with concentrated perinuclear staining.
While the labeling for eIF4G appeared more diffuse through-

out the cytoplasm, concentrated staining around the nucleus
was also seen. Notably, 8 out of the 19 MPNSTs analyzed
showed intense (3+) eIF4G staining.

Similarly, VS specimens displayed stronger labeling for all 3
eIF4F components than normal nerve tissues (Fig. 1B and Sup-
plementary Table S3). Intriguingly, the majority (12/20) of VSs
examined showed very strong (3+) eIF4A staining in the cyto-
plasm with high concentrations at perinuclear locations
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Also, most (12/20) VSs exhibited
very strong cytoplasmic staining of eIF4E. While the staining
pattern was more diffused compared with that of eIF4A, peri-
nuclear localization of eIF4E was still observed. In addition,
moderate-to-strong eIF4G staining was detected in most VSs.

To corroborate the IHC ﬁndings, we compared the protein
levels of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G in 2 human MPNST cell lines
(NF12/2 ST8814 and NF1+/+ STS26T) and 2 primary cultures
of VS cells from different patients with those in primary
human Schwann cells. Both MPNST cell lines expressed higher
levels of eIF4A and eIF4G than cultured Schwann cells
(Fig. 2A). While the eIF4E expression level in STS26T cells was
comparable to or slightly higher than that in Schwann cells, it
was slightly lower in ST8814 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that
primary VS cells expressed all 3 eIF4F components at levels
similar to those in Schwann cells (Fig. 2A). It is possible that

ST8814 and STS26T malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)
and Sch10545 schwannoma cells treated with 1x and 2x the IC50 dose
of silvestrol for 24 hours were analyzed by Western blots for the
expression of various cyclin, Aurora A, and PCNA proteins (A) and
total and phosphorylated AKT and its downstream substrate PRAS40
as well as FAK (B). GAPDH served as a loading control.

the growth factor-rich conditions enable cultured Schwann
cells to express more eIF4F components to promote higher pro-
tein synthesis for growth. To test this possibility, we directly
compared the expression levels of eIF4A and eIF4E in VSs
and normal vestibular nerve tissues. As shown in Fig. 2B, all 3
VS tumors examined had higher expression of eIF4A1
(�14-fold) and eIF4E (5 – 16-fold) compared with normal
nerve. These results indicate that both MPNSTs and VSs fre-
quently overexpress eIF4F components.

The high eIF4E expression is associated with malignant pro-
gression and poor prognosis in several types of cancers.3 In-
creased eIF4A levels also correlate with poor survival
in
estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.4 Thus, we deter-
mined whether the expression levels of the eIF4F components
correlated with clinicopathological parameters in MPNSTs and
VS. Of the 19 MPNST specimens analyzed, expression of
eIF4A, eIF4E, or eIF4G did not appear to correlate with tumor
grade, recurrence, or patient age (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S4). However, NF1-associated MPNSTs tended to exhibit
stronger eIF4G staining than sporadic tumors. Among the 20
VS tumors, all 4 NF2-associated tumors had very strong label-
ing for eIF4A (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5). The 7 cystic
VS tumors, all larger in size compared with the solid tumors an-
alyzed, also frequently showed strong staining for eIF4A (n ¼ 5/
7) and eIF4E (n ¼ 6/7). These associations, while interesting, did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance due to the small sample size
(P ¼ .6063 and P ¼ .4044, respectively). Nonetheless, frequent
overexpression of eIF4F components in VS and MPNSTs sug-
gests the importance of this eIF4F complex in the growth of
these tumors.

Knockdown of eIF4A and eIF4E Reduces MPNST
Cell Growth
To determine the role of eIF4F components in cell proliferation,
we used lentiviral-mediated shRNAs to deplete eIF4A1, eIF4A2,
and eIF4E in MPNST cells. Consistent with knockdown efﬁcien-
cies, shRNAs targeting eIF4A1, eIF4A2, or eIF4E substantially
reduced NF1+ STS26T cell growth relative to the nontargeting
control (Fig. 2C and D). Proliferation of NF1-deﬁcient ST8814
cells was even more profoundly inhibited by these shRNAs:
depletion of eIF4E halved cell growth, and silencing of eIF4A1
or eIF4A2 reduced cell numbers .80% (Fig. 2E). Intriguingly,
eIF4A1 depletion in ST8814 cells induced an increase in
eIF4A2 protein (Fig. 2F); however, this increase was unable to
rescue cell proliferation (Fig. 2E). Also, silencing eIF4A1 and
eIF4A2 resulted in reduced eIF4E expression, particularly in
ST8814 cells (Fig. 2F). This associated decrease in eIF4E by
depletion of eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 may augment the antiprolifer-
ative effects of these shRNAs (Fig. 2E). ST8814 cells also
showed decreased AKT levels after eIF4A1 depletion. Overall,
our results suggest that high levels of eIF4A and eIF4E are im-
portant for MPNST cell growth, and that both eIF4A1 and
eIF4A2 isoforms are required for maximal proliferation.

compounds (Supplementary Table S2) in primary human
Schwann and VS cells, Nf22/2 mouse schwannoma Sch10545
cells, and STS26T and ST8814 MPNST cells. Curiously, silvestrol,
which targets the eIF4A1/2 helicase activity,28 was identiﬁed as
the most potent agent with an IC50 value of (cid:31)15 nM in VS cells
compared with 40 nM in Schwann cells (Supplementary
Table S6 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Likewise, silvestrol potent-
ly inhibited the growth of STS26T cells at (cid:31)10 nM of IC50 and
ST8814 cells at (cid:31)40 nM of IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In ad-
dition, silvestrol suppressed mouse Sch10545 cells at slightly
higher concentrations (Supplementary Table S6). Flow cytome-
try analysis revealed that ST8814 and STS26T MPNST and VS
cells treated with 1 or 2 IC50 doses of silvestrol exhibited a sub-
stantial increase in the G2/M population (Fig. 3A). A sub-G1 frac-
tion, suggestive of cell death, was notably increased in
silvestrol-treated cells, particularly at the 2 IC50 dose. Consis-
tently, phase contrast micrographs taken from these cells im-
mediately before harvesting for cell cycle analysis showed
decreased cell density and increased numbers of rounded
and ﬂoating dead cells in silvestrol-treated dishes (Fig. 3B). Col-
lectively, these results suggest that silvestrol potently inhibits
proliferation of MPNST and VS cells by inducing cell cycle
arrest at G2/M.

Silvestrol Decreases the Levels of Several Cell-cycle
Proteins and Upstream Signaling Kinases
To examine the mechanism underlying silvestrol-induced cell
cycle arrest, we analyzed expression of several cell-cycle pro-
teins. As cyclins D and E have been implicated to be controlled
in part by protein translation,27,29 we proﬁled various cyclin pro-
teins expressed in the cell cycle. Interestingly, silvestrol treat-
ment induced signiﬁcant reductions in cyclins D1, E1, A, and
B1 in STS26T and ST8814 MPNST and Sch10545 schwannoma
cells (Fig. 4A). We also observed decreased protein levels of
the Aurora A kinase in silvestrol-treated cells. In addition, the
S-phase protein PCNA was markedly reduced in STS26T and
Sch10545 cells.

As MPNSTs and VSs frequently exhibit abnormal activation
of AKT, ERK1/2, and FAK,11,30 which are important drivers for
cell proliferation, we examined their expression following sil-
vestrol treatment. In both STS26T and ST8814 MPNST cells
and Sch10545 schwannoma cells, silvestrol induced a dose-
dependent reduction in the total AKT and p-AKT levels as
well as the total and phosphorylated protein levels of its
downstream substrate PRAS40 (Fig. 4B). Also, silvestrol re-
duced the expression of the FAK protein in MPNST and
Sch10545 cells. In addition, we observed a decrease in the
protein levels of total ERK1/2 and p-ERKs in ST8814 and
Sch10545 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest
that silvestrol-induced cell-cycle arrest may be mediated in
part by concurrently inhibiting the expression of multiple cy-
clins and mitogenic kinases.

Silvestrol Strongly Suppresses Tumor Growth in
Orthotopic NF12/2 MPNST and Nf22/2 Schwannoma
Models
To evaluate the antitumor efﬁcacy of silvestrol, we established
tumor-bearing mice by implanting luciferase-expressing
NF12/2 ST8814 MPNST or Nf22/2 Sch10545 schwannoma
cells into the sciatic nerves of SCID mice and used BLI to mon-
itor tumor growth. ST8814-Luc tumor-bearing mice, when
treated with HPbCD as the vehicle control, exhibited steady
and rapid increases in tumor bioluminescence over time
(Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, tumor-bearing mice treated with
1.5 mg/kg of silvestrol showed an average of 99% reduction
in tumor size (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Volumetric
measurement by MRI conﬁrmed our BLI results (Fig. 5C), al-
though BLI appeared to be more sensitive at detecting residual
tumor cells (Supplementary Table S7). Note that silvestrol was
well-tolerated at the 1.5 mg/kg dose, with no overt weight loss
in mice treated for 4 weeks (consistent with previous observa-
tions).18 Similarly, we also observed that silvestrol treatment
resulted in an average of 85% reduction in Sch10545-Luc
schwannoma size compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 5D
and E).

Histological staining of ST8814-Luc tumor sections showed
that the silvestrol-treated tumors exhibited less cellularity and
that the treated cells had nuclei with prominent chromatin
condensation, reminiscent of pyknosis (Fig. 6A). These pyknotic
nuclei indicate the sign of cell death.31 TUNEL staining con-
ﬁrmed that silvestrol induced a nearly 6-fold increase in apo-
ptotic cells in treated MPNST tumors.
Immunostaining
revealed that silvestrol-treated cells had a marked increase in
the number of phospho-histone H3-positive cells, consistent
with our in vitro data showing both G2/M arrest and decreased
Aurora A in silvestrol-treated cells (Figs 3A and 4A). Similarly,
silvestrol-treated Sch10545-Luc tumors showed less cellularity
and increased TUNEL labeling (Fig. 6B).

Taken together, these results indicate that silvestrol possess-
es potent antitumor effects in NF12/2 MPNSTs and Nf22/2
schwannomas.

Discussion
Overexpression of eIF4A, eIF4E, or eIF4G is often oncogenic and
has been hypothesized to support the high protein synthesis
rates in tumor cells.2 We found that these eIF4F components
are frequently overexpressed in both MPNSTs and VSs and con-
ﬁrmed that depleting eIF4A or eIF4E reduces cell growth. These
results suggest that pharmacological targeting of the eIF4F
complex might be a viable strategy for treating these tumors.
Consistent with this notion, we have identiﬁed the eIF4A inhib-
itor silvestrol as a potent antitumor agent in MPNSTs and VSs.
High levels of eIF4F components in breast and hepatocellu-
lar carcinomas correlate with tumor progression and poor prog-
nosis.2,3 With the small number of tumors examined, we were

unable to ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant association between the
expression of the eIF4F components and clinicopathological
parameters in MPNSTs or VS. Interestingly, however, we
observed that NF1-related MPNSTs appeared more likely to
have stronger eIF4G staining than sporadic tumors. Likewise,
NF2-associated and cystic-type VS tended to express higher
eIF4A and eIF4E levels compared with non-NF2 and solid-type
tumors, respectively. A recent study showed that large NF2-
associated VS often exhibit more pronounced ribosomal protein

S19 expression compared with small VSs, suggesting higher
rates of protein synthesis in large tumors.32 More comprehen-
sive studies with larger sample sizes of MPNSTs and VS are
therefore needed to validate our ﬁndings.

As in patient tumors, cultured MPNST cells also overex-
pressed eIF4F components compared with normal Schwann
cells. Consistently, silencing of either eIF4A or eIF4E substan-
tially reduced MPNST cell growth, indicating the importance of
the eIF4F assembly in maintaining tumor cell proliferation.

Interestingly, we found that both eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 were im-
portant for MPNST cell proliferation as reducing either isoform
signiﬁcantly impeded cell growth. Also, eIF4A2 loss could not
be compensated by the more abundant eIF4A1 isoform. Like-
wise, the increase in eIF4A2 expression after eIF4A1 knock-
down did not rescue cell proliferation. The eIF4A2 isoform has
been implicated in the promotion of cap-dependent transla-
tion33 but its role in cell growth has not been deﬁned.34 More
study is needed to further understand the functions of these
2 eIF4A isoforms in protein translation of MPNST and VS cells.
Currently, an FDA-approved medical therapy for MPNSTs or VS
is not available. The highly invasive nature of MPNSTs makes
complete surgical removal rare and contributes to the poor sur-
vival rate of these tumors. Patients with VS have a risk of periop-
erative complications such as cerebral hemorrhage or
cerebrospinal ﬂuid leak along with profound deafness and facial
paralysis. Radiotherapy may introduce oncogenic mutations in
these tumors. Efforts to develop a medical therapy for MPNST
or VS have been made but with limited success. For example,
RTK inhibition using erlotinib shows little clinical beneﬁt for
VS.35,36 In the case of VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab, about
50% of VS patients exhibit tumor regression and hearing im-
provement36; however, there is a renewed tumor growth if it is
necessary to discontinue treatment due to adverse effects.
Also, the prolonged use of kinase inhibitors frequently activates
alternative signaling pathways, conferring drug resistance. Addi-
tional targeted therapies and drug combinations are under eval-
uation as potential treatments for these tumors.

Drugs that target protein synthesis have been used for cancer
treatment. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo) is a plant-
derived alkaloid that binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit, blocking
peptide elongation.37 Synribo is FDA-approved as a third-line
treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to RTK in-
hibitors.38 The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin from Streptomyces
hygroscopicus indirectly inactivates eIF4E, preventing its cap-
binding ability. Rapamycin is used as an immunosuppressant
to prevent organ transplant rejection and exhibits antiprolifera-
tive effects. The rapamycin-derivative everolimus is currently
used as therapy for advanced renal cancer and pancreatic neu-
roendocrine tumors.39,40 However, rapamycin and its derivatives
are ineffective in VS patients and are cytostatic in MPNSTs.41,42
Several other inhibitors of protein biosynthesis were also discov-
ered as natural products. Cycloheximide from Streptomyces gri-
seus blocks the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Due to
severe adverse effects, cycloheximide is only used as an experi-
mental tool. The marine natural product pateamine A inhibits
eIF4A3; however, its high toxicity and difﬁculty in acquiring sufﬁ-
cient amounts have limited its drug development.

Silvestrol, ﬁrst isolated from the tropical rainforest plant
Aglaia foveolata, exhibits potent anticancer activity. Its full
structure and absolute conﬁguration have been established
and conﬁrmed by chemical synthesis.13,15,43 – 45 Silvestrol is a
reversible inhibitor of the eIF4A1/2 helicases, preventing the in-
corporation of eIF4A into the eIF4F cap-binding complex.19,20
As a translational inhibitor, silvestrol has broader effects on
tumor cells beyond those inhibitors targeting upstream signal-
ing pathways such as AKT and ERKs. Indeed, we demonstrate
that in addition to these 2 kinases, silvestrol reduces multiple
cyclins, Aurora A, and FAK. Tumors often evade targeted thera-
pies by re-activating PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling through

alternative pathways. Silvestrol may prevent this mode of
drug resistance since by inhibiting eIF4A, it reduces AKT levels
in multiple cell types (as we and others have observed).46 In ad-
dition, blocking eIF4F activity can reverse vemurafenib resis-
tance in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells.47

Our observation that silvestrol treatment induced both G2/M
arrest and a profound reduction of multiple cyclins and kinases
in both MPNST and VS cells is consistent with reports indicating
that silvestrol causes rapid cyclin loss and subsequent cell cycle
arrest.14,21 As cyclins D and E are translationally regulated,27,29
silvestrol may directly interfere with cyclin protein synthesis.
Since tumor cells frequently abrogate the G1 checkpoint, they
maintain G1 progression despite decreases in G1 cyclins. Since
the levels of the Aurora A kinase were substantially reduced by
silvestrol, MPNST and VS cells would be expected to arrest in
G2/M. Alternatively, silvestrol may also activate the G2/M check-
point by promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species.13
Furthermore, decreasing protein synthesis by silvestrol would like-
ly trigger long-term changes in cell signaling over time. It has
been shown that the silvestrol-related rocaglamide A decreases
the activity of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor
important for cell metabolism, proliferation, and stress survival.48
This decrease in HSF1 activity was observed with several classes
of translational inhibitors, including cycloheximide. Thus, reduced
HSF1-mediated transcription may be a general consequence of
impeding protein synthesis. It is plausible that part of silvestrol’s
antitumor activity is due to a blockade in HSF1-mediated tran-
scription, making treated tumors vulnerable to apoptosis.

In summary, our results identify the eIF4F complex as a po-
tential drug target for both MPNSTs and VS, tumors that currently
do not have effective chemotherapy. The eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol
was selected from our natural compound screening as the most
potent antitumor compound in both tumor types, validating
eIF4F as a possible tumor target. As silvestrol was well-tolerated,
these promising results indicate that silvestrol merits further ex-
ploration as a drug candidate for MPNSTs and VS.
