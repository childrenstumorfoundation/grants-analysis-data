Abstract

Serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a trimeric holoenzyme that plays an integral role in the regulation of cell
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The substrate specificity and (sub)cellular localization of the PP2A holoenzymes are
highly regulated by interaction with a family of regulatory B subunits (PP2A-Bs). The regulatory subunit PP2A-B/PR55d
(PP2A-Bd) is involving in the dephosphorylation of PP2A substrates and is crucial for controlling entry into and exit from
mitosis. The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of PP2A-Bd gene (PPP2R2D) remain largely
unknown. To explore genetic variations in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D gene as well as their frequent haplotypes in the
Han Chinese population and determine whether such variations have an impact on transcriptional activity, DNA samples
were collected from 70 healthy Chinese donors and sequenced for identifying genetic variants in the 59-flanking region of
PPP2R2D. Four genetic variants were identified in the 1836 bp 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D. Linkage disequilibrium (LD)
patterns and haplotype profiles were constructed for the genetic variants. Using serially truncated human PPP2R2D
promoter luciferase constructs, we found that a 601 bp (2540 nt to +61 nt) fragment constitutes the core promoter region.
The subcloning of individual 59-flanking fragment revealed the existence of three haplotypes in the distal promoter of
PPP2R2D. The luciferase reporter assay showed that different haplotypes exhibited distinct promoter activities. The EMSA
revealed that the 2462 G.A variant influences DNA-protein interactions involving the nuclear factor 1 (NF1). In vitro
reporter gene assay indicated that cotransfection of NF1/B expression plasmid could positively regulate the activity of
PPP2R2D proximal promoter. Introduction of exogenous NF1/B expression plasmid further confirmed that the NF1 involves
in the regulation of PPP2R2D gene expression. Our findings suggest that functional genetic variants and their haplotypes in
the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D are critical for transcriptional regulation of PP2A-Bd.

Introduction

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly conserved serine/
threonine phosphatase which may account for up to 1% of cellular
protein and the majority of serine/threonine phosphatase activity
in the cell. The physiological
functions of PP2A have been
implicated in all aspects of cellular processes [1,2]. The PP2A
heterotrimeric holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic subunit
(PP2A-C), a scaffold subunit (PP2A-A) and one member of four
families of regulatory subunits (PP2A-Bs). The structural (A) and
catalytic (C) subunits form the constitutive core enzyme, which
associates with one of a large number of regulatory B subunits.
The PP2A-Bs subunits are derived from four diverse gene families
(B, B9, B0, and B09). There is little sequence similarity between
families, but members of a family maintain high similarity. Given
the large number of PP2A subunits, it is thought that each cell

expresses a dozen or more distinct holoenzyme complexes, which
act on a diverse array of substrates [1,3].

The B family (B55, PR55) of regulatory subunits is encoded by
four genes (PPP2R2s): Ba, Bb [4], Bc [5,6], and Bd [7]. B family
members (PR55s) exhibit temporal and spatial expression patterns;
B55a (PR55a) and B55d (PR55d) are expressed almost ubiqui-
tously, while B55b (PR55b) and B55c (PR55c) are highly enriched
in the brain [4,5,7]. The primary structures and functions of the B
subunits are conserved from yeast to mammals [8]. The structures
of the PR55 subunits are predicted to form b-propellers with
divergent N-terminal
tails that act as signals for subcellular
targeting [9,10,11]. A structural feature of the PR55 subunits is the
presence of five degenerate WD-40 repeats. WD-40 repeats are
minimally conserved sequences of approximately 40 amino acids
that typically end in tryptophan-aspartate (WD) and are thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions [12].

In vitro dephosphorylation assays support a role for Bd in the
targeting of the PP2A heterotrimer to the dephosphorylation and
inactivation of ERKs [13]. Mochida et al. reported that a
particular form of PP2A containing a B55d subunit (PP2A-B55d)
has antimitotic activity and is the major protein phosphatase to act
on model cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrates in Xenopus egg
extracts [14]. An interplay between the Drosophila serine/threonine
(gwl) and PP2A/Bd during mitotic entry was
kinase Greatwall
recently observed in two separate studies [15,16]. PP2A/Bd
activity prevents mitotic entry by maintaining Cdc25 in a
dephosphorylated and inactive state [17]. Similar cell cycle
regulatory activity has been observed with the mammalian
ortholog of gwl, microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-
like (MASTL); however, the human MASTL-PP2A interaction
has not been characterized [17]. Together, these data indicate that
PP2A/Bd plays essential roles in the regulation of substrate
dephosphorylation and in cell cycle signaling pathways.

Currently, no functional variants of the PP2A-Bd subunit gene
(PPP2R2D) have been found, and little is known about
the
regulation of PP2A-Bd expression. Moreover, the allele distribu-
tion in specific population is yet to be defined and a functional
characterization of genetic variants or single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in the 59-flanking region of the PPP2R2D gene has
not yet been undertaken. In this study, we identify four variants
and multiple various haplotypes in the 59-flanking region of
PPP2R2D in the southern Han Chinese population and demon-
strate that certain functional variants in diverse haplotypes and
nuclear factor 1 (NF1) may regulate the transcription of PPP2R2D
gene and the expression of PP2A-Bd.

Materials and Methods

Study subjects

Seventy healthy Han Chinese donors were recruited for this
study. The individuals were randomly selected from residents of
Guangzhou city (Guangdong province, China) in southern China.
At recruitment, each participant was personally interviewed to
obtain detailed information on their demographic characteristic
such as gender, age and related family background. All subjects
were unrelated ethnic Han Chinese confirmed by ID cards and
‘‘Household Register books’’, which serve as identification in
China as described in our previous study [18]. After physical
examination, 5 ml of blood was collected, labeled, and delivered to
the laboratory for immediate DNA isolation. This study was
approved by the ethics committee of the School of Public Health,
Sun Yat-sen University, and written informed consent was
obtained from each subject.

Variants screening

Genomic DNA samples derived from peripheral blood were
used to search for genetic variants within the 59-flanking region
(21775 nt to +61 nt) of the PPP2R2D gene (the first nucleotide of
the RNA transcript is defined as +1 nt). The 1836 bp 59-flanking
fragment of PPP2R2D gene from each subject was amplified by
PCR using a pair of primers (Table 1). The PCR cycling
conditions were 94uC for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 94uC
for 30 seconds, 55uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 2 minutes, with
a final extension step at 72uC for 10 minutes. Genetic variants
were detected by direct sequencing of the purified PCR products
with the ABI PRISM DYE Terminator Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, USA) using three sequencing primers (Table 1) to
sequence the complete fragment. Finally, the Sequencer program
was used to identify genetic variants that were then confirmed by 2
independent observers. We further confirmed these variant

cing the variant sites from the opposite strand.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis and haplotype
construction

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and pairwise linkage
disequilibrium (LD) indices were calculated with the Haploview
version 3.2 software (Broad Institute). We estimated the degree of
pairwise LD between variants as quantified by the disequilibrium
coefficients D9 or r2 [19]. They define pairs to be in ‘strong LD’ if
the one-sided upper 95% confidence bound of D9 is .0.98 (that is,
consistent with no historical recombination) and the lower bound
is above 0.7. A P value of ,0.05 was used as the criterion of
statistical significance. All relevant haplotypes in the current
population were also generated with Haploview.

Plasmids construction

To evaluate the promoter activity of different parts of the 59-
flanking region of the PPP2R2D gene with various haplotypes, we
made serial truncations of the PPP2R2D promoter fragment and
analyzed the activity of the reporter constructs. Three different
upstream primers and one downstream (+61HR3) primer
(Table 1), flanked by restriction sites at the 59-end, were designed
for PCR reactions that employed human genomic DNA (wild-
type) as template. The truncated fragments, which included F1
(21775 nt to +61 nt, 1836 bp as distal promoter), F2 (21245 nt
to +61 nt, 1306 bp as middle promoter), and F3 (2540 nt to
+61 nt, 601 bp as proximal promoter), were cloned into the
pGL3-Basic Luciferase Reporter Vector (Promega), respectively.
The recombinant plasmids, named pGL3b-2R2Dp-F1, -F2, and -
F3, were confirmed by sequencing.

To examine the function of different haplotypes on PPP2R2D
promoter activity, a series of reporter plasmids with different
haplotypes encompassing the F1 fragments of human PPP2R2D
were constructed by PCR from three genomic DNA samples with
native haplotypes. The resulting constructs were termed pGL3b-
2R2Dp-F1H1 (for distal 59-flanking region F1, haplotype 1, and

To construct the NF1/B expression plasmid (pEGFP-NF1/B),
NF1/B coding sequence was amplified from total human cDNA
by PCR using primers flanked with restriction sites (Table 1). The
fragment was then cloned into the EcoR I and Xho I sites of
pEGFP-N1 vector
that contains an expression cassette of
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The pEGFP-N1
vector was purchased from Clontech (TaKaRa Bio Company). All
reporter constructs and expression plasmids were further verified
by direct nucleotides sequencing.

Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays

The immortalized human normal hepatocyte L02 cell line was
kindly provided by Dr. Shi-mei Zhuang (Sun Yat-sen University)
[20]. The L02 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Thermo Fisher), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO)
in a humidified incubator
(37uC, 5% CO2).

For luciferase reporter assays, L02 cells (16104) were plated in
96-multiwell plates and grown to 80–90% confluence. Transfec-
tions were performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a
previous study from our group [18]. Cells were cotransfected with
50 ng of pRL-TK vector DNA (Promega) and 200 ng of either
empty pGL3-Basic plasmid (a promoterless control; Promega) or
one of
several pGL3b-2R2Dp constructs harboring different
lengths and allelotypes or haplotypes of the PPP2R2D promoter.
The pRL-TK vector, which provided the constitutive expression
of Renilla Luciferase, was cotransfected as an internal control to

(250 ng,
500 ng, 1000 ng, respectively) of
transcription factor NF1/B
expression plasmid (pEGFP-NF1/B) or corresponding empty
vector (pEGFP-N1), and reporter gene plasmids
(200 ng of
pGL3b-2R2Dp-462G or -462A, and 50 ng pRL-TK vector) were
transfected into L02 cells. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were
collected and analyzed for luciferase activity with the Dual-
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Promoter activity
was reported as relative light units (RLUs) and normalized against
the activity of the empty pGL3-Basic vector. All transfections were
carried out in triplicate and repeated at least thrice in independent
experiments.

in the given
DNA sequence based on the TRANSFAC database of eukaryotic
transcription factors (TFs; TRANSFAC10). The Transcription
Element Search System (TESS) was also used to integrate
potential TFBSs in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D with
various polymorphic alleles.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

To investigate whether sequence variants alter DNA-protein
interactions, EMSAs were performed with the PPP2R2D promoter
fragment using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit
(Thermo Fisher), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Nuclear proteins were extracted from confluent cultures of
human L02 cells with a Nuclear Extraction Kit (Active Motif).
Double-stranded oligonucleotides to be used as DNA probes were
labeled with biotin at the 59-end. Probe sequences corresponding
to the 2462 G.A variant in the PPP2R2D promoter region were
59-biotin-GAATATTACATTGTACAGAAGCCAACAAAAGT-
TATTGCATAG-39 for 2462 G, and 59-biotin-GAATATTA-
CATTGTACAGAAACCAACAAAAGTTATTGCATAG-39 for
2462 A. The consensus sequence of the 59-biotin-labeled double-
stranded probe designed to recognize transcription factor NF1 was
59-GGGCTAGATGGCTGCCAGCCAAGGCTTCAT-39[21].
All
labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides were ordered from
Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Complementary
oligonucleotides were annealed and used either as probe or
competitor DNA. In each EMSA reaction, an aliquot of 59-
biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide (10 fmole) was
incubated with 10 mg nuclear protein extract for 20 minutes at
room temperature in 20 ml of binding buffer (100 mM Tris,
500 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, pH 7.5) with 1 ml poly(dINdC) (1 mg/
ml). For competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of
unlabeled cold probe was added to the mixture as a specific
competitor before the incubation period. For the supershift
experiment, 10 mg of nuclear extract was preincubated with
anti-NF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, CA)
for
30 minutes at room temperature before the addition of labeled
probe. After the addition of the labeled probe, the reactions were
incubated for another 45 minutes on ice, then submitted to 6%
native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred (0.56
TBE, 100 V, 60 minutes) onto a positively charged nylon transfer
membrane (Magmaprobe, Osmonics Inc.). Bands were visualized
by stabilized streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR

To analyze PPP2R2D mRNA levels, total RNA was extracted
from L02 cell lines transfected with NF1/B encoding plasmids
(250 ng, 500 ng, 1000 ng of pEGFP-NF1/B, respectively) or its
corresponding empty vector (pEGFP-N1) using TRIzolH reagent
(Invitrogen). Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed into
signal-strand complementary DNA using oligo dT primer and
PrimeScriptTM RT Enzyme Mix I (SYBRH PrimeScriptTM RT-
PCR kit, TaKaRa). Relative gene expression quantitation for
PPP2R2D, with ACTB as an internal
reference gene, was
performed with ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems) based on
the SYBR-Green method. Primers used were: PPP2R2D,

threshold (CT) values of each reaction derived from the target
gene, determined with ABI 7500 system software, were
normalized to ACTB levels. The DCT was calculated by
subtracting the CT of ACTB from the CT of the target gene of
interest. The DDCT was calculated by subtracting the DCT of the
reference sample from the DCT of each sample. Fold change was
generated using the equation 22DDCT.

Western blot analysis

Total proteins were extracted from L02 cells that cotrans-
fected with pEGFP-NF1/B plasmid with lysis buffer (50 mM
HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA,
0.5 mM PMSF and the proteinase inhibitor cocktail). 70 mg of
total proteins were used for each lane of loaded sample. The
protein blots were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in TBS buffer
for 1 hour and then incubated for overnight at 4uC with
antibody against PP2A-Bd (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, CA),
and b-actin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, MA) at a
dilution of 1:500 and 1:3000, respectively. The secondary
antibody was anti-goat IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 and 1:3000
respectively. The blots were detected using the enhanced
chemiluminescence method (Pierce).

Statistical analysis

LD analysis was performed using Haploview. The genotype
frequencies in the study subjects were compared with the
frequencies expected by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
by goodness-of-fit x2, and the x2 values
statistical
significance and their corresponding P values were calculated.
Pairwise LD between SNPs was measured using the disequi-
librium parameters D9 and r2. D is a measure of the difference
between the frequency of a haplotype and the frequency that is
expected under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. D9 is a stan-
dardized version of D that ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the
D9-value, the greater the association between the two loci being
studied. Heterozygosity (p) was calculated as the average of
2jk/n(n-1) for all base pairs screened, with j and k referring to
the number of copies of
the minor and major alleles,
respectively (n = j+k). Student’s t test for two groups or ANOVA
with an S-N-K test for multiple groups was used to examine the
differences in luciferase reporter gene expression. P,0.05 was
used as the criterion for statistical significance. All statistical
tests were two-sided.

Identification of genetic variants within the 59-flanking
region of PPP2R2D in the southern Han Chinese
population

We sequenced a 1836 bp segment of the 59-flanking region of
PPP2R2D in seventy healthy subjects and identified four genetic
variants (Table 2). The four variants found in this population are
registered in the current NCBI SNP database (dbSNP): 21684
A.G (rs11146169) (Fig. 1A), 21610 A.T (rs77523588) (Fig. 1B),
21196 C.T (rs9419202) (Fig. 1C), and 2462 G.A (rs7074421)
(Fig. 1D). Although 21684 A.G (rs11146169) is present in the
dbSNP database, the minor allele frequency (MAF) for this site is
less than 1% in our study population. Among the seventy healthy
Han Chinese subjects, the MAF for the four genetic variants in all
the variant allelotypes was 21684 G (0.71%), 21610 T (5.71%),
21196 T (2.14%), 2462 A (2.14%). All the allele frequencies were
in HWE (P.0.05). The MAFs for three of the variants (21684
A.G, 21196 C.T, and 2462 G.A) were less than 5%. Not

and resequenced with an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer. The genomic
DNA samples collected from 70 healthy donors in southern Han

sequences for 2462 GG and 2462 GA genotypes. The arrows indicated
the nucleotide variants.

surprisingly, none of the minor alleles of the three variants were
observed in the homozygous state in any of the samples in the
current population. Information regarding the SNP coordinates,
MAF, and HWE of the variants is presented in Table 2.

To characterize the distribution of these variants in the 59-
flanking region of PPP2R2D, the MAFs in this southern Han
Chinese population were compared to those in HapMap
populations. The four genetic variants have been observed
previously in various populations and their allele frequencies
(from HapMap phase 3 data) are reported in Table 3. The MAF of
21684 A.G in our sample (0.71%, n = 140) was lower than that

were not statistically different from each other (P.0.05). The MAF
of 21610 A.T in our study (5.71%) was similar to that of Asian
populations in HapMap-HCB and -JPT (5.0%, n = 120). The

MAFs of 21196 C.T were significantly higher than the MAF of

MAF of 2462 G.A in our study (2.14%, n = 140) was distributed

Next we assessed the degree of heterozygosity (p) in the southern
Han population with HapMap phase 3 data. The heterozygosity
of 21684 A.G (p = 0.014, n = 140)
in the Han Chinese
population was found to be slightly lower than that
in the
HapMap-HCB (p = 0.044, n = 90) and HapMap-JPT (p = 0.022,
n = 90) populations, but showed no significant difference. The p
value for 21610 A.T (p = 0.109, n = 140) was similar to that in
HapMap-HCB+JPT (p = 0.096, n = 120) (P.0.05). The p value
for 21196 C.T (p = 0.042, n = 140) was also found to be similar
to that in HapMap-JPT (p = 0.046, n = 172) and slight higher than
in HapMap-HCB (p = 0.023, n = 86) but displayed no
that

(p = 0.042, n = 140) was significantly lower than that in HapMap-
CEU (p = 0.251, n = 226) and HapMap-YRI (p = 0.341, n = 226)
populations (P,0.01). The p value for 2462 G.A (p = 0.042,

n = 140) was distributed similarly to the 21196 C.T. These
results indicate that the differences in heterozygosity might be due
to racial differences. Variations with high heterozygosity values
usually have functional significance and merit further study.

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis

To examine the degree of linkage among the four variants
identified in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D, We quantified the
degree of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) using the
disequilibrium coefficient D9 or r2 and the EM-based algorithm
of Haploview 3.2. Because there is no single best measure of LD
that is universally applicable, the complementary measures D9 and
r2 were used in this study [22]. The 21196 C.T and 2462 G.A
variants were found to be in high LD in this Han Chinese
population, with r2 = 1.0 and the lower and upper bounds of the
for D9 at 0.59 and 1.00,
95% confidence interval
respectively (Fig. 2). However, other variants were found to be in
low LD, with an upper 95% CI bound for D9 of 0.97 and a lower
bound of 0.04 (r2,0.01) in this population sample. The LD results
are consistent with the distribution of genotypes and the
heterozygosity of
these genetic variants in the southern Han
Chinese population.

(95% CI)

Haplotype analysis was performed on variants in the 59flanking
region (21775 nt to +61 nt; F1 fragment) of PPP2R2D to identify
haplotypes among the southern Han Chinese population and to
estimate their frequencies. Three major novel haplotypes (F1H1,
F1H2, and F1H3) were identified and their frequencies were
calculated in our sample population; the other haplotype identified
was rare and accounted for 0.72% (Table 4). Consistent with the
LD analysis described above, alleles 21196 C and 2462 G were
found to be transmitted together, as were the 21196 T and 2462
A alleles. However, no separate haplotype blocks were observed
might help to suggest that the different 59-flanking regions are
independent functional domains in PPP2R2D gene. Tag SNPs
were found for three of the variants (21684 A.G, 21610 A.T,
and 2462 G.A) in the distal and proximal 59-flanking region of
the PPP2R2D in current study sample.

approximately 42% (relative to the longest construct, F1). This
result indicates that transcriptional repression exists within this
distal promoter region. Removal of 705 bp from the 59-end of the
F2 fragment generated construct F3 (2540 nt to +61 nt). F3
generated 125% of the luciferase activity of the F1 construct and
213% of the activity of the F2 construct. This indicates that critical
cis-acting elements required for PPP2R2D transcription are located
in the F3 region harboring the proximal promoter and suggests
that the region between 2540 nt and +61 nt is responsible for
most of the promoter activity of PPP2R2D. Therefore, the F3
the proximal 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D is
fragment of
recognized as the active core promoter. The F3 fragment contains
the four variants identified earlier (2462 G.A). To
one of
investigate the effect of this potential
functional SNP on the
expression of PP2A-Bd,
the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D
containing the 2462 G or 2462 A allele was subjected to further
functional analysis for the promoter activity.

Differential proximal promoter activity of PPP2R2D with
2462 G.A variants

We wished to assess the impact of the 2462 G.A variant on
the transcriptional activity of the PPP2R2D proximal promoter.
We generated two luciferase reporter gene constructs, pGL3b-
2R2Dp 2462 G and 2462 A, that contained different alleles at
position 2462 nt in the proximal promoter region of PPP2R2D.
The recombinant plasmids were transfected into L02 cells. The
empty vector (pGL3b) and a Renilla construct (pRL-TK) were used
as controls (Ctrl). As shown in Fig. 4, the two PPP2R2D proximal
promoter constructs generated higher levels of luciferase expres-
sion than the empty vector control (P,0.05). The two constructs
also differed from each other in luciferase expression. The F3
fragment containing variant 2462 G displayed the higher
transcriptional activity than the fragment containing 2462 A
(P,0.05). These data indicate that different allelotypes have a
significant effect on the transcriptional activity of the PPP2R2D
proximal promoter.

Differential transcriptional activity of different PPP2R2D
promoter haplotypes

To assess the impact of

the potentially functional variant
identified above (Fig. 5A) on the transcriptional activity of the
different PPP2R2D promoter haplotypes, we generated three
luciferase reporter gene constructs (pGL3b-2R2Dp-F1H1 — -
F1H3), each of which contains a different haplotype in the
promoter region of PPP2R2D (Fig. 5B). The recombinant plasmids
were transfected into L02 cells along with the empty vector
(pGL3b) and a Renilla construct (pRL-TK), which were used as
controls. As shown in Fig. 5C, all the constructs provided higher

using wild-type human genomic DNA as the template (Fig. 3A).
Subsequently, we generated truncated constructs (F1, F2, and F3)
by progressive deletion of nucleotides from the 59-end and cloned
these fragments into the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Fig. 3B).
These constructs were transiently transfected into human L02 cells
and tested for luciferase activity to define the minimal sequence for
the transcription of PPP2R2D.

As shown in Fig. 3C, the promoter activity of all the constructs
was higher than the basal activity of the pGL3-Basic vector used as
control (Ctrl) (P,0.05). Sequential deletions made to the 59-end of
the 1836 bp F1 fragment to generate the construct from F1 to the
1306 bp F2 fragment resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity of

The F1H1 and F1H2 fragments containing the 2462 G variant
showed 52.4% and 20.2% higher transcriptional activity than the
F1H3 fragment containing 2462 A (P,0.05). Given that the
region between 2540 nt and +61 nt is the core promoter, the
2462 G.A variant may be a functional variant involved in the
transcriptional regulation of the PPP2R2D gene. Although both
the F1H1 and F1H2 haplotypes contain 2462 G allelotype, the
transcriptional activity of the H2 haplotype was 21.3% less than
that of H1. This indicates that no single variant completely
accounts for the expression differences observed at the haplotype
level. Taken together, these data indicate that different variants
associated with the functional 2462 G.A variant
in the
haplotypes play significant roles in the transcriptional activity of
the PPP2R2D promoter.

The 2462 G.A variant affects NF1 binding to the
proximal promoter of PPP2R2D

factors

In Silico analysis of the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D using a
computer algorithm revealed several putative binding sites for
transcriptional
(TFs). Some of TFs binding patterns
changed when the observed genetic variation in 59-flanking region
of PPP2R2D was taken into account (Table 2). Interestingly, the
2462 G.A variant located in the proximal promoter of PPP2R2D
altered the binding site of the transcription factor NF1 (Table 2).
To further confirm this finding, we performed an electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA).

To identify whether these cis-acting elements physically interact
with trans-factors, we incubated nuclear extracts from human L02
cells with two 59-biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides
containing the 2462 G or the 2462 A variant. In mobility shift
assays where only one band was observed on the gel, a DNA-
protein complex was detected with the 2462 G probe, but not
with the 2462 A probe (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 6, A and B).
The difference in the binding affinity of these two probes was
shown by competition experiments using unlabeled 2462 G or
2462 A cold probes. The DNA-protein complex containing the
2462 G probe (Fig. 6A, lane 1) was completely outcompeted by
the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled 2462 G
probe (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Besides, the DNA-protein complexes in
lanes 1 (Fig. 6A) are in the same position as the labeled NF1
consensus probe (Fig. 6A, lane 7), suggesting that NF1 in the
nuclear extract bound to the probe.

Consistent with the competition assay, the cross-competition
assay showed that this DNA-protein complex was completely
outcompeted by the same amount of unlabeled NF1 consensus
probe (Fig. 6A, lane 3; Fig. 6B, lane 5), but not outcompeted by
the same amount of unlabeled 2462 A probe (Fig. 6B, lane 4),
suggesting that the protein bound to the 2462 G probe may be
NF1 and the 2462 G probe has specific affinity for nuclear
proteins. Supershift assay was performed at the same time to
determine whether NF1 could bind this sequence containing
2462 G variant. As shown in Fig. 6B, the presence of anti-NF1
antibody in the sample containing nuclear protein and labeled
2462 G probe resulted in a clear supershift complex of the band
(Fig. 6B, lane 7). These results indicate that the presence of 2462
G or 2462 A in the proximal promoter region of PPP2R2D may
affect the binding of NF1 to its target region in a sequence-specific
manner.

NF1 plays an important regulatory role in PP2A-Bd gene
expression

Next, we designed cotransfection experiments in L02 cell to
provide direct evidence of
identified transcription factor NF1
regulating PPP2R2D gene promoter activity and PP2A-Bd
expression. As shown in Fig. 7A, overexpression of the NF1/B
induced a dose-dependent increase in the luciferase activity of
2462 G luciferase reporter in L02 cells. However, this dose-
dependent response was abolished in 2462 A luciferase reporter.
Furthermore, we also detected the PPP2R2D mRNA and protein
expression levels of L02 cells (2462 GG genotype) transfected with
NF1/B encoding plasmids by using real-time RT-PCR and
western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7B and Fig. 7C, the mRNA
and protein expression levels of endogenous PPP2R2D were
enhanced in a dose-dependent manner after overexpression of
250 ng to 1000 ng exogenous NF1/B expression plasmid.
Together, these results demonstrate that NF1/B displays a positive
regulation on the transcription of PPP2R2D gene and upregulates
the expression of PP2A-Bd.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that
genetic variants and their haplotypes in the 59-flanking region of
PPP2R2D gene can contribute to variations in the transcriptional
regulation of PP2A-Bd. The identified four known genetic
variants,
three haplotypes in the promoter region and their
distribution in the population provide fundamental information
for genotyping PPP2R2D in the southern Han Chinese population.
Experimental data indicate that the functional variant 2462 G.A
involves in the transcriptional regulation of PPP2R2D and the
transcription factor NF1 interacts with the 2462 G.A variant
present within the proximal promoter region of PPP2R2D.

Moreover, promoter fragments harboring different haplotypes
exhibit different promoter activities, which imply that genetic
variants are likely to regulate PP2A-Bd expression and, conse-
quently influence its dephosphorylation functions.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the most abundantly
expressed serine/threonine protein phosphatases. A large body of
evidence suggests that PP2A is a tumor suppressor [23,24,25], and
that
it plays critical roles in the regulation of many cellular
processes [26,27,28]. The regulation of regulatory B subunits of

HapMap phase 3 database. In this southern Han population, the
allele frequencies of the 21684 A.G, 21610 A.T, 21196
C.T, and 2462 G.A variants were determined to be
0.993:0.007, 0.943:0.057, 0.979:0.021, and 0.979:0.021, respec-
tively; the minor G, T, T, and A alleles (for 21684 A.G, 21610
A.T, 21196 C.T, and 2462 G.A, respectively) are rare and
only heterozygous genotypes were found in this population.
Interestingly, our study shows that the MAFs of the variants differ
between our study population and the Han Chinese in Beijing,
China. This is consistent with a previous study showing that the
greatest genetic differences among the Han Chinese are between
the northern Han Chinese (N-Han) and southern Han Chinese (S-
Han) [34]. Moreover, studies based on analyses of archeological,
anatomical, linguistic, and genetic data have consistently suggested
the existence of a significant boundary between the northern and
southern populations in China [35]. These results suggest that
genetic variants differ in their occurrence across ethnic groups.
Our data not only update the HapMap database, but they also
reveal significant differences between different ethnic subgroups.
SNPs and their characteristic distribution in a target population
for investigating the genetic basis of
are valuable resources
individual susceptibility to damage or even disease. These variants
can now serve as markers
fine-scale genetic mapping
experiments and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [36].
Both tumorigenicity and functional haploinsufficiency have been
attributed to mutations in the A subunit of PP2A (PP2A-A). These
mutations promote degradation of A subunit [37,38]. With regard
to the B subunits of PP2A (PP2A-Bs), a recent study demonstrated
that a SNP in PPP2R5E (the gene coding for B56e, a B56 family
regulatory subunit of PP2A) is associated with human soft tissue
sarcoma [39]. Furthermore, a case-control study using haplotype
analysis of tagged SNPs in the PPP2R2A (coding for PP2A-Ba) and
PPP2R1A (coding for PP2A-Aa) genes demonstrated that certain
genotypes were protective for breast cancer, while others modified
the risk for women with proliferative breast
lesions [40]. A
candidate gene association study identified a SNP (rs319217,
A.G) in the PPP2R2B gene (coding for PP2A-Bb) that manifests
allelic differences in the cellular responses to treatment with
chemotherapeutic agents [41]. In addition, a study suggested that
a CAG repeat polymorphism in the PPP2R2B gene may be
functional and may, in part, play a role in conferring susceptibility
to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and essential tremor (ET) in Taiwan
[42]. A similar study from Kimura et al. suggested that CAG repeat
lengths in the PPP2R2B gene may be potential genetic markers for
AD susceptibility in the Japanese population [43]. Lin and
colleagues have reported that the CAG repeat length, in addition
to the CREB, SP1, and TFAP4 proteins, plays a critical role in
regulating PPP2R2B promoter activity [44]. More recently, a study
indicated that the A variant of a SNP (rs319217 A.G) in the
PPP2R2B gene is a marker for improved prognosis of breast cancer
[45]. However, the genetic variants in the PPP2R2D gene remain
largely unknown. In the light of previous reports implicating
PP2A-Bd in the regulation of the cell cycle and the dephosphor-
ylation of specific substrates, we designed experiments aimed at
functionally analyzing the identified variants in the 59-flanking
region of PPP2R2D.

We designated a region of 601 bp (2540 nt to +61 nt) as the
core proximal promoter of PPP2R2D because it displayed the
highest transcriptional activity in luciferase assays. We constructed
proximal promoter fragments mirroring the PPP2R2D allelotypes,
including either one or the other allele of the 2462 G.A variant,
and tested them for transcriptional activity. Promoter activity assay
revealed that the most common allelotype (F3H1), containing the
G2462 polymorphism, exhibited a higher transcriptional activity.

expression of PPP2R2D. A. Expression of the exogenous NF1/B in L02
cells induced dose-dependent increase in the luciferase reporter activity

Transfection of pEGFP-NF1/B or its corresponding empty vector (pEGFP-
N1) into L02 cells and cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection.
PPP2R2D transcripts were measured and normalized to ACTB by real-
time RT-PCR. The relative ratio of PPP2R2D mRNA in L02 cells
transfected with empty vector was set as 1.0 for a control. The relative
expression levels of the endogenous PPP2R2D were increased in a dose-
dependent manner after introduction of 250 ng to 1000 ng pEGFP-
NF1/B plasmid (*P,0.05). C. Overexpression of the exogenous NF1/B in
L02 cells induced dose-dependent enhanced expression of

Promoter activity analysis
the most common
haplotype, F1H1 (namely A21684/A21610/C21196/G2462), with
an overall frequency of 92.1%, showed the highest transcriptional
activity. The other two variant haplotypes, F1H2 (A21684/
T21610/C21196/G2462) generated less transcriptional activity than
F1H1, while F1H3 (A21684/A21610/T21196/A2462) exhibited the
least activity of the three constructs. This result suggested that
transcription may be more tightly regulated in F1H2 than in
F1H3. Consistent with the result of core proximal promoter
(601 bp, 2540 nt to +61 nt) activity assay, the luciferase reporter
gene assays also showed that haplotypes bearing the 2462 G allele
had higher promoter activity than those that carried the 2462 A
allele. Our results implied that different haplotypes composed of
different genetic variants can influence the transcriptional activity
of the PPP2R2D.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the 2462 G.A variant is
located in a recognition sequence for NF1, which implies that this
portion of the 59-flanking sequence may be important for NF1-
mediated regulation of gene expression. The NF1 family is
encoded by four genes, NF1/A, /B, /C, and /X, which express a
large number of splice variants that can act either as transcrip-
tional activators or repressors depending on cellular and promoter
context [46,47,48,49]. The proteins of NF1 family play a wide role
in the replication of several vital DNA molecules and in the
transcription of many cellular genes. A significant role for NF1 in
regulating cellular growth, hormonal
induction and repression,
and oncogenic processes has been also described [46]. In this

study, an EMSA revealed that the NF1 forms a complex with a
DNA probe containing 2462 G, but not with an identical probe in
which G at position 2462 nt was substituted for a 2462 A allele.
Supershift and cross-competition assay demonstrated that human
NF1 binds to the proximal 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D that
contains 2462 G variant. Introduction of exogenous NF1/B
expression plasmid into L02 cells induced dose-dependent increase
the PPP2R2D promoter activity and also upregulated the
of
expression of the endogenous PPP2R2D. Because NF1 can act as
an activator or repressor of the same gene depending on the cell
type or promoter context, it can be suggested that the variant
2462 G.A with different affinity for NF1 might help to alter
transcriptional activity and, thus,
increase mRNA and protein
expression of PPP2R2D. In accordance with this hypothesis, our
results further confirmed that the NF1 may implicate in the
positive control of PP2A-Bd expression.

This study reveals, for the first time, the occurrence of variations
and distinct haplotypes in the 59-flanking region of PPP2R2D in
the southern Han Chinese population. We provide data to indicate
the 2462 G.A variant can functionally regulate the
that
transcriptional activity of PPP2R2D. The data provide support
for further investigation into the molecular and cellular mecha-
nisms behind the significant allelic differences between haplotypes
and the effect of different haplotypes on the regulation of
PPP2R2D. In the future, our haplotype information should allow
for more efficient association studies, permit comparisons with
studies of other ethnicities and help to identify people who are
susceptible to damage or disease linked to these genes.
