Abstract
Background We observed bone marrow signal changes
(BMSC) in patients with plexiform neurofibromas after
treatment with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec).
Objective To evaluate the pattern and natural history of BMSC.
Materials and methods The data were obtained from a pilot
study of imatinib mesylate in patients with plexiform neuro-
fibromas. All patients underwent baseline and sequential
whole-body STIR 1.5-T MRI after treatment. The bone
marrow signal on MRI was evaluated for abnormalities,
location and pattern, and any change on follow-up studies.
Results The study group included 16 patients (8 males) with
a median age of 14 years (range 4 to 25 years). The mean
whole-body MRI follow-up duration was 1.9 years. Of the
16 patients, 14 (88%) developed BMSC. The signal change
was asymmetrical in 9 of the 14 patients (64%). The appen-
dicular skeleton was involved in all 14 patients and the axial
skeleton in 3 patients (21%). BMSC was followed in 13
patients and decreased signal was seen in 9 patients (69%)

after a mean duration of 1.3 years of treatment (range 0.6 to
2.9 years); no complications were observed.
Conclusion BMSC appeared in most patients with neurofi-
bromatosis type 1 following treatment with imatinib mesylate.
BMSC was unusually asymmetrical and involved the lower
extremities. On follow-up, BMSC often showed a decrease
without complications.

Introduction

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ)
represents a new generation of chemotherapy-specific drugs
that were developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) [1]. Imatinib mesylate selectively inhibits
tyrosine kinase and was later found to inhibit other targets. It
was tried for the treatment of various tumors and found
useful in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors because
of its action in inhibiting of c-kit proto-oncogene [2].

Plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) is one of the major features
of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) [3]. It can cause substantial
morbidity, disfigurement and functional impairment, and can
transform into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, a
complication that is refractory to treatment [4, 5]. Studies in a
mouse model have demonstrated that imatinib mesylate can
decrease the size of PNF by a direct effect on the neurofibroma
cells by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor receptors
(PDGFR) α and β [6] and indirectly by inhibiting c-kit in
mast cells that promote tumor production of Schwann cells
[7]. Based on the results in the mouse model, imatinib mesy-
late was administrated to a critically ill 3-year-old child with

Pediatr Radiol (2012) 42:1218–1222

PNF compressing her airway and resulted in a marked de-
crease in tumor size [7].

To evaluate the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in patients
with NF1 and PNF, we participated in a pilot study of imatinib
mesylate therapy. Patients in our pilot study underwent whole-
body MRI. We noted abnormal signal in the bone marrow of
our patients after the start of treatment with imatinib mesylate.
Fluid retention is a common side effect of imatinib mesylate
[8–12]. We believe our finding of abnormal marrow signal is
due to localized bone marrow edema. This is a unique finding.
The purpose of our study was to investigate the frequen-
cy, distribution and time relationship of the MR appearance
of bone marrow signal changes (BMSC) in relation to
imatinib mesylate administration in patients with NF1.

Materials and methods

This review was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of our institution. As part of a pilot study to evaluate the use of
imatinib mesylate to treat patients with NF1 and PNF, patients
underwent repeated MRI examinations. As some patients with
NF1 have multiple sites of PNF, whole-body MRI was per-
formed. A baseline examination was performed before the
start of the treatment. Additional studies were done after 2, 6
and 12 months, and then annually while on therapy. All

patients met clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1. Only patients
with a biopsy-proven PNF that was potentially life-
threatening or with significantly impaired quality of life were
included. All patients had at least one follow-up study. All
MRI examinations were performed with a 1.5-T MAGNE-
TOM Avanto (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen,
Germany) using only a STIR sequence in the coronal, sagittal
and axial planes (159×512, time to recover 3,000 ms, time to
echo 17 ms, time to inversion 150 ms).

Using a Synapse workstation (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT), two
fellowship-trained pediatric radiologists with 14 years and
31 years of experience retrospectively reviewed in consensus
the examinations for each patient in order of acquisition. All
the examinations obtained after starting treatment were com-
pared to the pretreatment baseline studies for the presence of
any new posttreatment bone marrow bright signal. The af-
fected bone was recorded. The BMSC was classified as either
focal (if it was well-defined) or diffuse (if it was widespread
in the bone marrow). For each patient, the location of BMSC
was classified as symmetrical or asymmetrical, and the
amount of BMSC between studies was categorized as stable,
decreased, increased or variable (some BMSC decreased and
some increased).

Medical records were reviewed for change in treatment
with imatinib mesylate and the presence of cutaneous edema
was identified on physical examination.

Results

We identified 16 patients (8 males) with a median age of
14 years (range 4 to 25 years). Treatment with imatinib
mesylate was completed in 15 patients with an average treat-
ment period of 1.7 years (range 0.6 to 3.0 years). One patient
(patient 6) was still receiving treatment when the imaging
findings were reviewed. The average length of whole-body
MRI follow-up was 1.9 years (range 0.4 to 3.2 years). Only
four patients (patients 1, 3, 12 and 15) had follow-up (average
0.9 years, range 0.2 to 1.1 years) MRI studies after completion
of treatment.

The imaging findings are summarized in Table 1. Of the
16 patients, 14 (88%) developed BMSC. BMSC was asym-
metrical in 9 of the 14 patients (64%) and symmetrical in the
other 5 (36%). The appendicular skeleton was involved in
all 14 patients, while the axial skeleton was involved in only

three patients (21%). The pattern of BMSC was diffuse in
six patients (Fig. 1), focal in three (Fig. 2) and mixed in
five. In three patients, BMSC involved the epiphysis
(Fig. 3).

BMSC was first demonstrated, on average, after 0.5 years
(range 0.2 to 1.4 years). Follow-up MRI studies were per-
formed in 13 patients after the first appearance of BMSC. It
decreased in 9 of the 13 patients (69%) after a mean period
of 1.3 years (range 0.6 to 2.9 years) without any observed
complications. BMSC decreased first after completion of
treatment in only one patient (patient 1). In all other eight
patients, BMSC decreased during treatment. In five patients
(patients 8, 10, 11, 12 and 15), BMSC resolved completely.
In one patient (patient 1), resolution of BMSC in the bilat-
eral femurs was observed on a follow-up study 1.0 years
after completion of treatment. The tibiae were not imaged in
that study. In one patient (patient 14), BMSC resolved

tient (patient 5) had increased BMSC and two others
(patients 2 and 9) had variable changes in BMSC. These
three patients had a mean follow-up of 1.6 years (range 0.9
to 2 years). Five of the 14 patients who developed BMSC
(36%) had edema at other sites, including the face (three
patients), soft tissue of the lower extremities (one patient),
and both the face and lower extremities (one patient). The
dose of imatinib mesylate was decreased prior to the 2-
month follow-up MRI scan in each of these five patients.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to summarize the MRI find-
ings in patients with NF1 and PNF who developed bone
marrow edema during treatment with imatinib mesylate.
Bone marrow changes have been reported in two other
patients treated with imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal
tumors [13]. We therefore believe that this marrow change
is probably not unique to patients with NF1. The reason that it
has been reported previously in only two patients is that
whole-body MRI studies are not typically performed in
patients with CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, which
are the most common indications for treatment with imatinib
mesylate. In patients with CML, BMSC may mimic recur-
rence of disease.

We found BMSC in almost all patients (88%) treated
with imatinib mesylate. Follow-up MRI studies demonstrat-
ed a decrease in BMSC in most patients (69%). The de-
crease in BMSC was observed from 0.6 to 2.9 years after
treatment and it is possible that, in patients who had persis-
tent BMSC, a longer follow-up period may have shown a
decrease in BMSC. It was usually (in 64% of patients)
asymmetrical and involved the appendicular skeleton in all
patients. BMSC was diffuse or focal and mainly involved
the diaphysis and metaphysis of the long bones, but seldom
involved the epiphysis.

The pathogenesis of BMSC is not known. Biopsy of
BMSC has been reported in a patient treated with imatinib
mesylate for gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Pathology dem-
onstrated cell necrosis [13]. There is also a case report of
massive bone marrow necrosis in a patient treated with
imatinib mesylate for CML [14]. Bone marrow changes on
MRI were not reported in that patient. Our study has the
advantage of follow-up studies. None of the patients in our
study developed typical MRI features of bone infarct. Ima-
tinib mesylate can change bone mineralization metabolism
[15]. Osteoporosis resulting from these changes can be
associated with BMSC. Another possibility is that BMSC
represents bone marrow edema. The signal characteristics,

1222

time-course of the BMSC, lack of local bone symptoms and
lack of long-term complications are highly suggestive that
the abnormal MRI signal is due to edema. In addition, fluid
retention is a common complication of treatment with ima-
tinib mesylate [8–12].

Cutaneous edema is one of the most common side effects
of treatment with imatinib mesylate and has been reported in
up to 65% of patients [8–11]. Other forms of fluid retention
included ascites, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion
[12]. The development of edema is dose-related [11], but
the pathophysiology of edema is unclear. As this is a dose-
related effect, it may be related to a pharmacological effect
of imatinib mesylate rather than hypersensitivity. One pos-
sible mechanism is related to the drug’s inhibition of
PDGFR, which has been shown to increase interstitial fluid
pressure in the dermis of rodents [16]. The inhibition of
PDGFR by imatinib mesylate may result in increased cap-
illary permeability and extravasation of fluid [11, 16].

After its initial appearance, we noted a decrease in BMSC
on further follow-up MRI studies in 69% of our patients,
without any observed complications. One-third of our
patients also had cutaneous edema, most commonly involv-
ing the face. We did not note an association between loca-
tion and severity of cutaneous edema and BMSC.

There are several limitations to the study. One of the
major limitations is the lack of pathological confirmation
of BMSC. This was not needed, as patients did not have any
symptoms or complications from the abnormal marrow sig-
nal. In addition, the study was reviewed in consensus and
therefore there are no result of interobserver variability.
However, this is justified as our study was a pilot study
and a report of a new observation [17].

Conclusion

We found that BMSC commonly occurs in patients with
NF1 treated with imatinib mesylate. The pathogenesis of
BMSC is not clear. BMSC is usually asymmetrical, involves
the appendicular skeleton and is often decreased or disap-
pears without complications during treatment. Recognition
of the frequent asymptomatic occurrence of BMSC should
prevent erroneous diagnoses such as infection or tumor
infiltration of the marrow.
