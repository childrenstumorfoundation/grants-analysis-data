Cells  continually  gossip  with  their  neighbors,  deciding
together when to divide, when to differentiate, and when to
die. Often, cells communicate with one another by delivering
protein  messages.  These  proteins—hormones,  growth  fac-
tors, chemokines, etc.—are far too large to enter the receiv-
ing  cell,  so  an  elaborate  mechanism  of  signal  transduction
has been developed, to transmit messages from the cell sur-
face into the cell nucleus, where the topic of conversation is
implemented as a change in gene expression.

As  one  might  imagine,  mutation  of  proteins  within
these  signal  transduction  pathways  has  disastrous  conse-
quences. If the message is altered, the cell may get a false
message to proliferate, leading to cancer. For this reason,
the  genes  of  many  signal  transduction  proteins  were  first
discovered in their role as  oncogenes—genes that lead to
cell  transformation  when  mutated—before  their  functions
in normal cells were elucidated.

The  ras oncogenes were among the first to be discov-
ered.  The  Ras  proteins  deliver  signals  from  cell  surface
receptors, such as growth factor receptors, G-protein coupled
receptors  that  recognize  molecules  such  as  thrombin  and
bradykinin, and integrins. These signals are then passed pro-
tein-to-protein  along  several  different  pathways,  ultimately
effecting  mitogenic  functions  such  as  lipid  metabolism,
DNA synthesis, and cytoskeletal organization. Disruption of
these signals through mutation of the ras gene is involved in
many tumor types, including roughly half of all colon cancers
and 90% of pancreatic carcinomas.

The Ras protein sits at the center of a many-tiered cascade
of molecular interactions. Most of the proteins along this cas-
cade are activated by phosphorylation, but Ras uses a bound
guanine nucleotide to toggle between its “on” and “off” states.
Normally, Ras binds GDP in its neutral state. A message is

Figure 1. Ras protein. Ras is a small protein with a central func-
tion. In this illustration, carbon atoms are in white, oxygen is in
red (for charged atoms) and pink (for uncharged atoms), nitrogen
is in shades of blue (bright blue for charged atoms), and sulfur is
yellow.  Hydrogen  atoms,  which  are  not  seen  in  the  crystallo-
graphic structure, are not shown. Two features are readily appar-
ent. At the top, the lipid-like farnesyl group extends upward, ready
to attach the protein to the cell membrane. At bottom left, the gua-
nine  nucleotide,  in  green,  is  bound  in  a  deep  cleft.  Oncogenic
mutations typically change amino acids in the protein loops sur-
rounding  the  nucleotide,  uncoupling  the  state  of  the  nucleotide
from any change of conformation in the protein. Coordinates were
taken from entry 121p in the Protein Data Bank.

Figure 2: A Ras signaling pathway. The
mitogenic  signal  delivered  by  platelet-
derived  and  epidermal  growth  factors
activate  the  Ras  signaling  pathway.  A
complex series of interactions carry and
amplify the signal from the cell-surface
receptor to the nucleus. The signal begins
at  the  top  of  the  illustration.  The  cell
membrane runs horizontally, and growth
factor (yellow) has brought two receptor
molecules  (yellow-orange)  together.
These receptors span the membrane, and
when brought adjacent, the portions on
the interior side of the membrane phos-
phorylate themselves. These phosphory-
lated  receptors  are  then  recognized  by
adapter molecules, such as Grb2 and Shc
(orange), which use SH2 domains to rec-
ognize  the  phosphorylated  site.  These
adapters  then  bind  to  the  guanine
nucleotide exchange factor SOS (named
after the Drosophila gene son-of-seven-
less). This protein then interacts with Ras
(red), expelling the GDP nucleotide and
allowing GTP (green) to bind. Ras then
triggers  a  cascade  of  MAP  kinases,
shown  ranging  from  light  pink  to  dark
pink, that deliver the signal to its target.
Other molecules seen in the illustration
include  long,  sinuous  spectrin  proteins
just under the cell membrane, and sturdy
actin filaments crisscrossed through the
cytoplasm below.

passed from the receptor to Ras by
guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) that expel this GDP, allow-
ing GTP, which is more plentiful in
the  cytoplasm,  to  bind  in  its  place.
GTP causes a subtle rearrangement
of the protein, which then triggers a
cascade  of  mitogen-activated  protein  kinases.  These  kinases
ultimately phosphorylate the target, such as a transcription fac-
tor, delivering the message to its final destination.

This signal is necessarily self-limiting. Ras hydrolyzes
GTP to GDP fairly quickly, turning itself “off,” and a col-
lection of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) speed up the
process, ensuring that the amount of active Ras within the
cell is tightly linked to the amount of receptor that is bound
at the cell surface. Imagine, however, what happens when Ras
loses this control. Oncogenic mutation makes Ras insensitive
to  the  state  of  the  nucleotide,  so  it  is  continually  switched
“on.” The message is delivered continuously, giving the cell
unchecked permission to proliferate.

There  is  some  hope  for  treatment  of  cancers  that  show
mutations in the ras oncogene. The early steps of signal trans-
duction, from receptor to Ras, occur on the inside of the cell
membrane. Ras itself is tethered to the membrane through a

short isoprenoid group, which is attached to a specific cysteine
on the protein soon after it is synthesized. The modification is
performed by the enzyme farnesyltransferase. Inhibitors of this
enzyme block the maturation of Ras, and thus are promising
candidates  for  targeting  of  rogue  cells  with  ras oncogenes.
