Abstract

Purpose: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder asso-
ciated primarily with bilateral schwannomas seen on the superior vestibular branches
of the eighth cranial nerves. Significant morbidity can result from surgical treatment of
these tumors. Meningiomas, ependymomas, and other benign central nervous system
tumors are also common in NF2. The lack of effective treatments for NF2 marks an un-
met medical need.
Experimental Design: Here, we provide recommendations from a workshop, cochaired
by Drs. D. Gareth Evans and Marco Giovannini, of 36 international researchers, physi-
cians, representatives of the biotechnology industry, and patient advocates on how to
accelerate progress toward NF2 clinical trials.
Results: Workshop participants reached a consensus that, based on current knowledge,
the time is right to plan and implement NF2 clinical trials. Obstacles impeding NF2 clin-
ical trials and how to address them were discussed, as well as the candidate therapeu-
tic pipeline for NF2.
Conclusions: Both phase 0 and phase II NF2 trials are near-term options for NF2 clinical
trials. The number of NF2 patients in the population remains limited, and successful
recruitment will require ongoing collaboration efforts between NF2 clinics. (Clin Cancer

The neurofibromatoses encompass three distinct inherited
rare disorders: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibro-
matosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis. For many
years, these disorders were viewed as part of “generalized
neurofibromatosis” (originally termed von Recklinghausen
disease). Three forms of NF were formally recognized as sep-
arate clinical entities at a NIH consensus meeting in 1987
(1). NF1 and NF2 are autosomal dominant disorders with
well-characterized genes: the NF1 gene on chromosome 17
and the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. More recently, a can-
didate gene for schwannomatosis was identified also on
chromosome 22 (2, 3).

NF2 mutations are found in >92% of NF2 individuals in the
second or greater generation of families (4). Interestingly, al-
though NF2 affects only 1:25,000 persons (5), population stud-
ies suggest that up to 1:300 people will develop in their lifetime
a tumor with an underlying sporadic NF2 mutation (5–8). This
includes persons with unilateral vestibular schwannomas
(UVS) as well as meningiomas. It is not clear if the underlying
biology of VS is the same in NF2 patients and those with spo-
radic tumors; however, VS in NF2 patients are known to grow
faster than their sporadic counterparts. Therefore, what we learn

Translational Relevance

Despite the fact that significant progress has been
made in our understanding of the biology of neuro-
fibromatosis type 2 (NF2), patients with this disorder
still face a poor clinical outcome, significant morbid-
ity, and a decreased life span. Here, we provide re-
commendations for accelerating clinical trials for
NF2 with a goal of stimulating rationally designed
trials using molecular-targeted agents that will im-
prove both survival and quality of life for NF2
patients.

in developing therapies for NF2 VS could have much broader
clinical applications.

Natural History and Clinical Management of VS
in NF2

The hallmark of NF2 is the growth of bilateral VS on the ves-
tibular nerves. Meningiomas are also predominant. Recent im-
provements in microsurgery and the advent of radiotherapy
offer initial treatment options. Nevertheless, NF2 has a signifi-
cant level of morbidity and early mortality (9, 10).

NF2 is diagnosed by the presence of bilateral VS (1, 11), al-
though NF2 diagnosis can also result from a UVS and at least
two other NF2-related tumors (11, 12). Although benign in
their primary state, VS are the main concern for most NF2 pa-
tients because they are responsible for the larger part of morbid-
ity and, to a lesser extent, mortality.

Today, surgery is the primary clinical tool for NF2 manage-
ment (9). VS tumors can require frequent surgeries: these are
intricate because the vestibular nerve is close to the acoustic
(cochlear) and facial nerves. VS surgery frequently leads to
deafness and loss of facial nerve function, infections, and
headaches (9, 13). A confounding aspect of NF2 is that there
is no correlation between tumor size and hearing loss (9). Al-
though there are challenges on the path to doing NF2 clinical
trials, there is a pressing need to identify an alternative or ad-
junct to surgery.

Some physicians have observed NF2 VS growing more rapid-
ly in children, in whom a benefit of early interventional surgery
may be preservation of long-term hearing (13). Some studies
suggest that VS grow intermittently up to 4 to 10 mm a year
in diameter and can be dormant up to 10 years before resuming
growth (9, 14).

Much remains to be understood about VS natural history.
A recent study enrolled 86 newly diagnosed NF2 patients
over 3 years, but being newly diagnosed, very few had tu-
mors that progressed during this time, probably underrepre-
senting the NF2 phenotype. Further data will be mined from
this study to see what we can learn about tumor growth.
Looking ahead, it may be difficult to get advanced NF2 pa-
tients with progressing tumors to enroll in a study, but it is
vital to pursue this to fully understand the natural course of
NF2 and establish appropriate outcome measures for clinical
trials.

Clinical Trials for NF2

Cochlear Implant and Auditory Brainstem Implant
for NF2 Patients

Interventional surgery is now being done at earlier ages to
preserve hearing, although, unfortunately, many patients iden-
tify expert care too late to save the cochlear nerve. NF2 patients
with VS of 1.5-cm maximal diameter, and speech discrimina-
tion scores of ≥70% in both ears, are good candidates for co-
chlear preservation surgery (suboccipital or middle cranial
fossa). Generally, when bilateral VS are present, the more “fa-
vorable” tumor for hearing preservation is removed first. Keys
to successful surgical hearing preservation are early VS detec-
tion, small tumor size, incomplete filling of the lateral end of
the internal auditory canal by the tumor, surgical team experi-
ence, superior vestibular nerve origin (means reduced caloric re-
sponse), and good preoperative hearing preservation. If hearing
is preserved following surgery, the second VS is carefully re-
moved, attempting to preserve the cochlear nerve. If, however,
hearing is not preserved following surgery on the first tumor,
and the unoperated ear retains serviceable hearing, careful ob-
servation is required before further surgery. If hearing is lost
with <60% word discrimination on the unoperated side, prom-
ontory stimulation is done on the first ear. If there is positive
auditory stimulation, a cochlear implant may be considered,
with hope for long-term sustained viability and excellent speech
discrimination (9, 15).

If neither cochlear nerve is stimulated, a multichannel audi-
tory brainstem implant (ABI) is considered (9, 13, 16) The ABI
is effective and safe, providing useful auditory sensations in
most deaf NF2 patients and improves ability to communicate
compared with “lip reading only.” ABI allows detection and rec-
ognition of many environmental sounds and can even offer sig-
nificant ability to understand speech using only sound from the
ABI (with no lip reading cues; ref. 16).

Natural History and Clinical Management of NF2
Meningiomas

Meningiomas are the second most frequent tumor of NF2
(1, 9, 11), generally slow growing, attached to the dura mater,
and composed of neoplastic arachnoidal cells (17, 18). Fifty
percent to 60% of NF2 patients will present with an average
of three meningiomas. Intriguingly, 20% of all primitive central
nervous system tumors are sporadic meningiomas with NF2-
associated mutations (18). Both surveillance and surgery are
used in meningioma clinical management, depending on tu-
mor growth history. For surveillance, clinical and radiological
[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] follow-up are required
at 6 months and then yearly with very few patients developing
new meningiomas (9). Surgery is done where there is signifi-
cant growth, parenchymal edema, or clinical symptoms such
as neurologic deficit, intractable seizures, or intracranial hyper-
tension. Preoperative transarterial embolization allows resec-
tion of hypervascularized convexity meningiomas. The goal in
NF2 meningioma surgery is to get a maximal safe resection; if
meningioma remnants remain, further treatment will be post-
poned until new growth or symptoms occur.

Reoperation is an important part of meningioma manage-
ment. The relative risk of mortality is 2- to 3-fold greater in
NF2 patients with meningiomas (9, 10) and determined by tu-
mor size and location. The most straightforward surgeries are in

the convexity far from eloquent brain areas (important areas for
function speech and motor function). The most risky are in
front of eloquent brain areas, midline tumors (parasagittal
and falx), and skull base.

Meningioma recurrence depends on completeness of resec-
tion and tumor pathologic grade. Thirty percent of NF2 menin-
giomas are aggressive (grade 2 and 3) versus 10% to 15% in
sporadic meningiomas, although this may be biased by the fact
that only growing or symptomatic tumors are removed in NF2
patients (8, 17).

Natural History and Clinical Management of NF2
Spinal Tumors

Spinal tumors are seen in 70% of NF2 patients. These are het-
erogeneous in type (meningioma, schwannoma, and ependy-
moma), distribution, and behavior. Larger tumors are more
likely to progress, and if symptomatic, surgery is currently the
only option. Overall, NF2 ependymomas are usually indolent
rarely requiring surgery. Spinal tumors are unlikely to be a pri-
mary measure in NF2 clinical trials because volumetric assess-
ment is complex.

Radiosurgery and Radiotherapy for NF2 Tumors

Use of radiosurgery and radiotherapy for NF2 management is
highly controversial, with some physicians using this and others
not. There are differences of opinion as to whether observation,
microsurgery, or radiosurgery is more effective in hearing pres-
ervation. Although there is no NF2 meningioma–dedicated lit-
erature report on radiosurgery or radiotherapy, for cavernous
sinus meningiomas surgery is not recommended, and radiosur-
gery may be helpful for rare symptomatic growing tumors. A
major concern of many is that radiosurgery and radiotherapy
may induce malignancy, including secondary meningiomas
and multiple small tumors. However, other than individual
case reports, the NF2 community lacks thorough data on the
risks, benefits, and outcome of radiotherapy and radiosurgery.

What Do We Know—and Do Not Know—about
NF2 Biology

The NF2 gene encodes Merlin, a novel tumor suppressor pro-
tein that lacks enzymatic function (19). Strategies to identify
targeted NF2 therapies begin with the delineation of the molec-
ular function of Merlin. Merlin resembles the ERM proteins (ez-
rin, radixin, and moesin) sharing considerable homology across
their NH2-terminal FERM domain, a trilobed structure that
seems to bring together multiple proteins at the cell membrane.
A growing body of information suggests that Merlin coordi-
nates and transmits multiple extracellular signals. Merlin/ERM
proteins undergo regulated conformational changes governing
localization and interaction with target proteins. Phosphoryla-
tion downstream of the small GTPases Rho (for the ERM
proteins) or Rac (for Merlin) represents the best-studied mechan-
isms of induced conformational change and altered localization/
activity. Merlin can, in turn, negatively regulate Rac signaling at
the level of the serine/threonine kinase Pak; Pak inhibitors are
being developed as potential NF2 therapies. Merlin can be phos-
phorylated on multiple residues by multiple kinases. The conse-
quences of these potentially regulatory events are only beginning

to be understood but should reveal multiple potential steps for
NF2 therapeutic intervention. In addition, different molecular
strategies may be necessary for different tumor types.

Study of Nf2-deficient cells from genetically engineered mice
(GEM) suggests that loss of Nf2 gene function leads to loss of
contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation. This fits with the
benign nature of tumors seen in NF2 patients. What is the molec-
ular basis? Merlin associates with the hyaluronic acid receptor
CD44, which can be important for mediating contact-dependent
inhibition of proliferation. Merlin is also necessary for the stabili-
zation of cadherin-containing adherens junctions between other
types of Nf2-deficient cells. In both cases, Merlin seems to sense
the physical extracellular milieu through adhesion receptors.

Recent studies in mammalian and Drosophila models have
suggested that Merlin controls surface availability of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other membrane receptors
(20, 21). Merlin coordinates cell contact stabilization with
EGFR silencing. Pharmacologic EGFR inhibitors can restore
contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation to several types
of Nf2-/- mouse cells, including Schwann cells. EGFR inhibitors
may therefore be of value in NF2, and preclinical in vitro studies
suggest that EGFR inhibitors affect a cytostatic response: Nf2-/-
cells proliferate again after drug withdrawal. Merlin may also
control surface availability of and signaling from other ErbB
family members, and microarray analyses suggest that the phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is strongly elevated in
Nf2-/- Schwann cells and schwannomas, which could be due in
part to deregulated ErbBs (22). Thus, drugs that target multiple
ErbB family members or the PI3K pathway should be consid-
ered for NF2. Studies in Drosophila suggest that Merlin can also
control the surface availability of other membrane receptors, in-
cluding Notch, and link Merlin to signaling via the Hpo/Wts/
Yki pathway (23, 24). Much work still needs to be done to fully
define the molecular function of Merlin and to fully unravel
candidate drug targets.

What Is the Status of NF2 Preclinical Screening
Tools?

As candidate NF2 drug targets emerge, good predictive pre-
clinical models are vital for assessment of new drug therapies.
Preclinical drug screening is a particularly critical step in NF2
where there is a limited patient population. Human schwanno-
mas are challenging to grow in vitro, although Schwann cell tu-
mor lines are now available (25). Cell line xenografts into mice
allow drug testing on the engrafted tumors (26).

Overall, there are three tiers of NF2 preclinical drug screen-
ing: (a) cell lines derived from human NF2 tumors or tumors
of NF2 GEM, (b) human or mouse NF2 tumor xenografts in
immunodeficient mice, and (c) GEM NF2 tumor models.
GEM mouse models ideal for drug screening are characterized
by (a) high penetrance of tumor development, (b) early initia-
tion and time to progression, and (c) ability to be bred in large
numbers. Developing NF2 GEM mouse models has been chal-
lenging, but advances in conditional somatic mutagenesis have
led to the development of mice with tumors representative of
NF2 (27, 28). However, these mice are resource intensive with
long latency and low penetrance of tumor lesions. Consequent-
ly, tiered screening is vital with GEMs reserved for screening the
most promising drugs. Recently, implementation of MRI and
other technologies for small-animal imaging has eased the

use of GEMs (29, 30). Further, the observation that strain back-
ground modifies the latency and penetrance of tumor develop-
ment in a mouse model of NF2 schwannoma (31), resulting in
a high rate and more predictable time frame of tumor develop-
ment, provides a more tractable GEM for drug testing.

Which Tumor Should Be Our First Focus in NF2
Clinical Trials?

VS and meningiomas could both provide initial targets in
NF2 clinical trials. VS seem to be the more consistent tumors;
they are also the most pressing concern for most NF2 patients
and therefore may be the preferred initial target. In general, me-
ningiomas are less of a concern if growing without edema or
seizures. However, if delivered systemically for a VS trial, drugs
would also hit meningioma as a secondary target. An interest-
ing population for NF2 clinical trials could be postsurgery me-
ningioma patients with tumor tissue left behind; drug
treatment could be tested as an alternate to radiosurgery. Drug
might be delivered to meningioma via transarterial emboliza-
tion delivery of small drug-loaded microspheres.

What Is the Role of Placebo in NF2 Clinical Trials?

Controls will be critical for NF2 VS and meningioma trials,
especially if tumor growth is sporadic. Although a placebo con-
trol is the ideal, NF2 patients are unenthusiastic about placebo-
controlled trials unless they can cross over to drug part way
through the trial. The inclusion of placebo will also significantly
increase the number of patients required. One option is that
NF2 patients can serve as their own control using pretreatment
MRI and audiology data if available.

These are specific recommendations about which tumor type

to target in NF2 clinical trials:

1. Define primary tumor of consideration as either VS or me-
ningioma (can be measured as separate arms of the same
study or in different studies). Meningiomas more likely to
be found in advanced- or end-stage patients. Volumetric
analysis is a critical part of the trial and will define tumors
to be studied. If possible, MRI information should be sub-
mitted to Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital volu-
metric imaging facility (14). Imaging should be done at
least every 6 months (every 3 months is preferred).

2. Spinal tumors should not be used as an entry criteria tu-
mor, but changes can be measured before and after the trial.
3. All cranial tumors should be assessed before and after the

trial.

4. Overall, consider all tumors assessable in addition to pri-

mary tumor.

5. If available, consider whole-body MRI at entry and exit for

assessment of overall tumor burden.

6. Trials should include VS or meningiomas of at least 1 cm
in diameter and/or that show a documented growth of ≥2
mm in a period of ≤2 years on linear assessment.

7. If outcome of trial is anticipated to include shrinkage, it

could potentially include VS of any measurable size.

8. UVS patients may play an important role in phase 0 trials
to quickly accrue enough patients to gather preliminary da-
ta of drug reaching target. However, UVS patients should
only be included in an NF2 trial if (a) the trial has stratifi-
cation (UVS have different biology so you may see differ-

Clinical Trials for NF2

ent results) and (b) the drug used is very safe, as UVS
present less of a threat.

9. If sporadic meningiomas are included, they must be NF2

related and be WHO grade <3.

10. Ideally, both the tumor and the patient should be tested

for NF2 mutation verification.

11.We may need to include patients with decreasing (>10 dB)

hearing but who have no documented tumor growth.

12. How many patients are already on unproven therapies?

Need to steer patients to proper trials.

What Are Critical End Points in Evaluating NF2
Therapeutic Efficacy and Outcome?

Although multiple questions may be investigated within a
clinical trial, to maximize statistical power and show efficacy,
a single question should serve as the primary end point (32).
This is used to determine design and duration of the study
and number of participants. Determining the primary end
point demands consideration of what can logistically be as-
sessed and what is clinically meaningful to those living with
NF2. Clinically meaningful end points may include hearing
loss, facial weakness, vision loss, limb weakness, surgical inter-
vention and outcome, and survival. Objective measures are
most feasible and reliable to measure. To avoid prolonged trials
(and as a result excessive financial and patient resources), the
end point should be attainable in a reasonable period of time.
Natural history and current clinical practices must be taken into
account so that the end point has meaning within the existing
clinical landscape.

Overall, the most clinically meaningful and feasible end
point is lesion changes on MRI of the brain because (a) NF2
patients routinely undergo extensive neuroimaging and tumor
progression is a common criteria for interventions such as sur-
gery, (b) basic MRI technology required is widely available, and
(c) MRI assessment of tumor change is objective when volumet-
ric tumor measures and central review are applied. However, it
is critical that image acquisition (magnet strength and slice
thickness) and imaging protocols (dose and timing of exoge-
nous contrast and imaging sequences) be standardized across
participating sites to minimize technical differences that con-
found image interpretation.

Volumetric tumor measures provide a more accurate assess-
ment of tumor growth than linear measures in both NF1 and
NF2 (14, 32–34). Indeed, assessment of VS changes on linear
measures may underestimate growth by >50% based on com-
parison with volumetric measures (14, 33, 34). Volumetric
measures provide an important tool to detect small changes,
critical given the slow-growing nature of VS. In summary, there
is consensus among NF2 experts that tumor volume MRI
changes are a desirable primary end point for NF2 clinical trials.
Is reduction in tumor size required to show efficacy? Or is
delay of growth progression sufficient as a result? If tumor re-
duction is required, trials may be shorter and will require smal-
ler patient numbers. Achieving tumor reduction does present a
high bar and could result in discarding drugs that control but
do not shrink tumors. In addition, the percentage reduction re-
quired to declare a drug efficacious is essentially arbitrary and
determined in part by the sensitivity of volumetric measure. In
contrast, an end point of tumor stabilization is more sensitive
for drug activity but will require more patients and prolonged

Perspective

observation. A compromise of these two is to assess the percent-
age change in tumor growth over time based on patients' nat-
ural history of tumor growth before starting the trial. This does
not require a reduction in tumor size but in tumor growth rate.
Of course, there is no reason that shrinkage could not be
observed in NF2, especially with a biologically targeted drug, as
these have been seen to result in marked regression or even erad-
ication of other tumors. Therefore, although stabilization of dis-
ease would be a move forward, we should not aim too low. Our
ultimate goal should be to shrink and eliminate these tumors.

Hearing preservation is a major quality of life (QoL) measure
for NF2 patients and indeed may motivate trial recruitment.
However, it may be difficult to identify sufficient patients if re-
cruitment is hearing based due to the fact that although some
centers do early “hearing preservation” tumor surgery, many
centers let hearing drop significantly (e.g., to 30%) before inter-
vention, in case surgery leads to complete hearing loss.

Secondary end points may include functional measures, in-
cluding audiology (e.g., ≥5 dB difference on 4-frequency
pure-tone average), ≥15% difference in speech discrimination,
measures of facial nerve function, and QoL measures.

Finally, because drugs are likely be given for extended periods
of time in NF2 trials, long-term assessment of toxicity and tol-
erability will be important.

The specific recommendations as to which tumor outcome
measures should be used in NF2 clinical trials are as follows:
1. Effect on tumor growth rate. Determine whether the end
point is (a) slowing or stabilizing growth of rapidly grow-
ing tumors or (b) tumor shrinkage. Reduction in absolute
tumor size is preferable.

2. Assess volumetric reduction or absence of growth. Mini-
mum reliable change is on the order of 10% to 20% volume
decrease for lesions over 1 cm in diameter (this corresponds
to 3-7% linear diameter decrease). Similar imaging technol-
ogy and sequences should be applied across centers.

3. For phase II studies, tumor shrinkage should be the end

point used due to study power concerns.

4. Loss of T2 signal may also serve as an outcome measure.
5. Hearing change may serve as an outcome measure (signif-
icant changes would be 4-frequency pure-tone average >5
dB change or 15% difference in speech discrimination).
There is good natural history available on hearing, which
is an important measure to the patients' QoL.

6. QoL measures. SF36, self-report measures.
7. Structured validated questionnaire to capture deficits (eye,

facial nerve, mobility, etc.).

8. Video assessment of facial nerve function (especially if a

surgical/stereotactic radiosurgery (STRS) arm).

9. Duration of drug effect: is efficacy dependent on chronic

drug delivery?

10. Record all toxicities.
11. In phase 0 trials: drug concentration, local drug effect on

molecular targets, and histologic features.

Which Patient Population Should We Target First
in NF2 Clinical Trials?

As NF2 is a rare disorder, clinical trials should aim to include
as broad a patient range as possible. Even major NF2 clinics re-
port having insufficient patients to conduct clinical trials, where-

as many NF2 patients are not under the care of an NF2 clinic and
may never learn about clinical trial enrollment opportunities.
This issue will grow as we move toward a time of multiple
NF2 trials ongoing, and toward phase II trials, which require
hundreds of patients. Moving forward, a collaborative consor-
tium between clinics is necessary to implement future clinical
trials. Patients are typically stratified in clinical trials by age, tu-
mor type, or severity. There are three broad NF2 populations: pa-
tients with tumors being conservatively followed for progression;
patients who have had tumor treatment but are at risk for recur-
rence; and patients with recurrent, progressive, or multiple tu-
mors who have no further surgical or radiotherapy options.
Different trial options may apply to different patient groups.
Each trial will require one tumor type for primary monitoring,
and the tumor should have measurable ongoing growth so that
drug efficacy—stopping tumor growth or tumor shrinkage—can
be monitored. Including only patients with progressive disease
(measurable tumor growth over some period of time) may limit
several possible recruits and therefore should be avoided.

There is growing interest in early NF2 VS microsurgery when
the tumors are small, and there is maximal opportunity for pre-
serving hearing and cranial nerve function. These individuals
may represent another population for future NF2 trials (e.g., a
trial to assess need for repeat surgery later in life). Patients re-
ceiving early surgical intervention could be followed and, when
recurrence occurs, be recruited to a drug clinical trial. For exam-
ple, in minimally affected patients, with preserved hearing and
small tumors, hearing-sparing microsurgery could serve as the
first-line approach; then, if hearing or speech deteriorates, pa-
tient is considered for clinical trial intervention. For patients
with larger tumors and preserved hearing, drug treatment may
be the first therapeutic option due to higher risk of hearing loss
faced with surgical therapy.

NF2 patients with multiple tumors who cannot undergo fur-
ther surgery offer a compelling study group and one in desper-
ate need of options. Further, these trials are likely to be efficient
if response is used as an end point. Here, drug treatment could
be offered in adjunct to surgery or if surgery has been ex-
hausted. Alternatively, patients could be enrolled into ongoing
trials for other cancers (generally phase I trials) that are biolog-
ically applicable to NF2, accessing treatment options otherwise
available. This may be a good approach for end-stage patients
with few options.

However, one patient population that may prove more chal-
lenging is those who have failed radiosurgery and as a result
may have become therapy resistant.

Finally, it is wise to keep in mind that NF2 patients may suf-
fer from “burnout”: after multiple surgeries and treatments,
how can we engage them in a clinical trial? A trial with a some-
what predictable and optimal outcome will be most attractive.
The specific recommendations as to which patients should be

enrolled in NF2 clinical trials are as follows:

1. Three broad patient populations:

a. Treatment naive: zero to one neurosurgical central ner-
vous system procedure. No major complication barring hearing
loss or minor mononeuropathy.

b. Few treatments and/or some NF2 morbidity. Two to three
central nervous system surgeries. Ambulant with no more than one
major complication.

c. NF2 severe. Multiple surgeries or severe morbidity

2. Two broad trial types:

a. Therapeutic: symptomatic patients for whom the goal

would be stabilization or response.

b. Preemptive: in patients with measurable presymptom-
atic disease (perhaps children) for whom the goal
would be stabilization.

3. Children ages 3 years and above may be included if the tumor
can reliably be imaged and monitored. However, some stud-
ies may need to be restricted to adults only, dependent on
properties of an experimental agent and age-related drug ef-
fects and toxicities.

4. Patients who have been through multiple surgeries or ra-
diation may have to be excluded (some risk for tumors to
be malignant; subsequent imaging of and tumor monitor-
ing may be impaired by surgical artifacts). However, if
there are sufficient numbers, these patients may be treated
as a separate study arm.

5. Include individuals awaiting surgery in phase 0 studies.
This may include sporadic UVS with caveat that data
should be handled separately (different biology).

6. Before enrollment, patients must be given usual treatment

options of surgery/radiosurgery.

7. Ask patients to consent to data collection if they do not

want to participate.

8. Patients must have normal organ function (renal, liver

function test, and complete blood count).

9. Patients cannot be or become pregnant during trials.
10. Patients must be able to give consent (including parental

for children).

11. Use of certain medications such as antiepileptics may
present a contraindication for inclusion (dependent on
pharmacologic properties of used agent). However,
many modern antiepileptics do not influence the hepatic
P450 system.

12. Patients with cochlear implants or ABIs will need to have the

device magnet removed for trial participation (imaging).

What Are the Models for NF2 Clinical Trials?

Clinical trials cover phases I to IV from safety to postmarket
approval studies. Phase I trial end points assess safety and tox-
icity. Phases II and III assess efficacy and, for brain tumors, may
use end points such as tumor response, improvement in symp-
toms, delay in tumor growth, and improved survival (35). The
path to an approved drug is often inefficient, requiring up to 10
years of investigation, and an estimated 90% of new agents fail
to secure approval for clinical use (36).

The NF Phase II Clinical Trials Consortium was established in
2005 with funding from the United States Army Congressional-
ly Directed Medical Research Program for Neurofibromatosis.
The Consortium consists of nine U.S. centers with international
collaborators focused on planning and executing phase II NF
clinical trials. Participating centers were selected based on abil-
ity to recruit patients and conduct phase II trials and on insti-
tutional commitment to the program. The Consortium has a
strong infrastructure, including a data coordination center.
The initial focus of the Consortium is NF1. The first phase II trial
testing rapamycin in plexiform neurofibromas began in 2008,

Clinical Trials for NF2

and a second trial testing lovastatin in NF1-associated learning
disabilities follows in 2009. Further trials are in planning.

This program encountered some hurdles during its inception
from which we can learn as we plan NF2 trials. Although par-
ticipating centers collectively can recruit a significant number of
patients, the phenotypes of these individuals will dictate what
trials can be done. In the future, alternative approaches may be
used. Another approach is to piggy back NF patients onto other
trials (e.g., patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mor, a rare malignancy in NF1, could enter sarcoma trials). The
Consortium is also adding expert collaborators as required.

There is an opportunity for NF2 trials with secured funding to
access the NF Consortium infrastructure. This will require the
addition of NF2 expert centers to the Consortium (existing
Consortium Centers are largely based in pediatric facilities,
which see few NF2 patients). The opportunity that phase II
NF2 clinical trials may be able to access Consortium resources
will be kept in mind as planning proceeds.

Nevertheless, full-scale phase II trials are challenging. These re-
quire (a) drug with a strong level of confidence, (b) funding support
for costs, and (c) successful patient recruitment. These demands, as
illustrated above, are magnified for the NF2 population.

In planning for NF2 phase II clinical trials, physicians must
share information on patient numbers and demographics. A
nearer-term opportunity for NF2 may be phase 0 clinical trials
to test drugs with known safety profiles from trials in other tu-
mors. In a phase 0 trial, a test drug is administered for a brief
window of time (hours, days, or, less commonly, weeks) before
surgery. Once the tumor is surgically excised, it can be analyzed
to see if the drug has reached its target, and for molecular
changes. Phase 0 trials offer, in a fairly short time, valuable in-
formation about whether a drug is reaching its target, and mo-
lecular changes it is inducing, using end points of tissue
concentration or in vivo biological effect. This information can
be used to improve the design of subsequent trials. This ap-
proach is particularly attractive when several promising agents
must be triaged for trials.

Phase 0 trials can be rapidly conducted and meaningful data
can be accrued from fairly small patient populations. This pro-
vides initial clinical data for a drug shown as promising in preclin-
ical testing to determine if it should advance to full clinical testing.
Phase 0 trials are used increasingly in oncology and may be
well suited to jump starting clinical trials for NF2. The limita-
tion is that these trials do not offer therapeutic benefit to parti-
cipants. In addition, they may inadvertently indicate that a
potentially active drug is inactive if the expected biological ef-
fect is not seen.

In summary, the best way forward for NF2 clinical trials
seems to be to start with multiple small pilot trials using the
most relevant agents available. Patients who do not respond
to a drug could move on to a different trial.

What Are the Candidate Drugs and Potential
Therapeutic Approaches for NF2?

Multiple agents could be considered for NF2 clinical trials. It
is possible that drugs targeted to NF2-induced signal abnormal-
ities could result in significant responses because, in cancer at
large, single gene disorders can respond dramatically to the
right therapy. Today, we know enough about NF2 biology to
plan clinical trials that consider a roster of potential agents.

Perspective

Some of these drugs are currently in clinical testing for other
disorders and therefore present near-term opportunities as
NF2 therapies. The roster of potential agents for NF2 clinical
trials is summarized in Table 1.

Many signaling pathways are potential targets for NF2 therapy.
Because EGF family growth factors are critical for the survival of
Schwann cells, the ErbB family of receptors represents a compel-
ling target class. Among the therapeutics that merit consideration
for NF2 in this group are the pan-ErbB inhibitor lapatinib and
the EGFR-selective inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, as well as
additional compounds in development. Blood-brain barrier pen-
etration may not be a requirement for therapeutic efficacy, so
ErbB-targeted antibodies such as trastuzumab, panitumumab, ce-
tuximab, and pertuzumab may be considered.

Downstream of growth factor receptors in the pathway that
affects cytoskeletal and proliferative responses is the small
GTPase Rac that binds and activates PAK1 kinase. PAK seems
to phosphorylate and inactivate Merlin. Therefore, a PAK1 in-
hibitor could act through two different mechanisms: direct
block of the growth factor–dependent tumor cell survival and
reactivation of Merlin if functional protein remains expressed in
the NF2 tumor. No PAK1 inhibitors are currently available for
clinical testing, but this approach merits consideration. Of in-
terest, Bio30, a natural therapy containing propolis isolated
from bee venom, has been proposed as a PAK1 inhibitor and
is available.

Additional candidate drug targets include PI3K/Akt, Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulat-
ed kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK, and mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR). NF2-derived tumors have been shown

to elevate phospho-Akt, and Akt-dependent phosphorylation
of Merlin has been shown to target this protein for ubiquitin-
dependent degradation. Although no PI3K or Akt inhibitors
are yet Food and Drug Administration approved, multiple
compounds are in development, primarily for oncology indi-
cations. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been implicated in
NF2 in part due to elevated levels of phospho-ERK and phos-
pho-MEK in tumors. One potential role for this pathway
derives from a study showing that Merlin can disrupt a pro-
proliferative complex involving assembly of Raf-1/B-Raf
heterodimers on the MLK3 kinase; this complex forms inde-
pendently of MLK3 kinase activity. This offers rationale for
testing Raf inhibitors such as sorafenib, or MEK inhibitors,
although the literature suggests that Raf inhibition is compli-
cated by a robust feedback loop normalizing flux through the
pathway in response to inhibitors.

A further therapeutic approach targets multiple pathways si-
multaneously. Hsp90 stabilizes a group of client proteins, in-
cluding ErbB, Raf, and Akt, so a single inhibitor could affect
many pathways dysregulated in NF2. Multiple Hsp90 inhibi-
tors are in clinical development. Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylami-
no-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) is entering phase III
trial for cancer, the first of this class to go to the clinic. How-
ever, 17AAG has some liver toxicity. A further compound that
inhibits multiple NF2 targets is the curry-derived natural prod-
uct curcumin, which seems to block many of the same targets
as Hsp90 inhibitors as well as additional targets such as focal
adhesion kinase.

An innovative new therapeutic overcomes translational blocks
due to nonsense mutations. This compound, PTC-124, allows

selective read through of nonsense mutations, frequently
found in NF2 patients. This drug is currently in phase II non-
oncology clinical trials but may offer a candidate NF2 treatment.
Finally, NF2 tumor development could also be affected by
blocking tumor blood supply using angiogenesis inhibitors.
Food and Drug Administration–approved angiogenesis inhibi-
tors include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–
targeted antibody Avastin and the VEGF receptor–targeted
small molecules sunitinib and sorafenib.

In summary, the most promising candidates for NF2 trials
suggested included Tykerb, Tarceva, Iressa, and Zactima, fol-
lowed by Hsp90 inhibitors (17AAG). These are likely to be
on the front-runner candidate list for near-term phase 0 or even
phase II clinical trials. Looking ahead, it will be critical to inte-
grate data emerging from preclinical drug screening into a pipe-
line of new candidate NF therapeutics for clinical trials. The
Children's Tumor Foundation20 endeavors to facilitate this via
a bench-to-bedside roster of programs, including Drug Discov-

Clinical Trials for NF2

ery Initiative Awards (pilot funding for NF preclinical drug
screening) and a $5M NF Preclinical Consortium and pilot
Clinical Trial Award program, as well as by serving as a conduit
for communication within the community of NF physicians
and researchers.
