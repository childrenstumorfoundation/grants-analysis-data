Abstract Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic
disorder with bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) as the
most frequent manifestation. Merlin, the NF2 tumor sup-
pressor, was identiﬁed as a negative regulator of mam-
malian target of rapamycin complex 1. Pre-clinical data in
mice showed that mTORC1 inhibition delayed growth of
NF2-schwannomas. We conducted a prospective single-
institution open-label phase II study to evaluate the effects
of everolimus in ten NF2 patients with progressive VS.
Drug activity was monitored every 3 months. Everolimus
was administered orally for 12 months and, if the decrease

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal-dom-
inant tumor predisposition syndrome, with an incidence of
1 case in 33,000 live births [1]. NF2 patients develop
multiple tumors including bilateral vestibular schwanno-
mas (VS), associated with hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or
balance disturbances [2]. The tumor burden presents usu-
ally early in life and clinical management is hampered by
the variability of hearing loss and VS growth [3]. Standard
management of NF2 is based on follow up and microsur-
gical resection of growing and/or symptomatic VS. How-
ever, surgical resection is associated with a signiﬁcant rate
of hearing loss and carries risks for facial function. Radi-
osurgery is an alternative therapeutic modality [4, 5].

treated with erlotinib, none experienced signiﬁcant radio-
logical changes [12]. However, lapatinib showed objective
activity in four out of 17 NF2 patients with progressive VS
in a phase II trial [13].

Recently, merlin, the NF2 protein, has been identiﬁed as
a novel negative regulator of mammalian target of rapa-
mycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin
yielding activation of mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related
tumors [14]. In a previous study, we have shown that
mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin reduced the severity of
NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis in several rele-
vant in vitro and in vivo models without signiﬁcant toxicity
[15]. Concomitant with these preclinical studies, we
administered rapamycin to an index patient with growing
VS over a prolonged period of time resulting in a clinically
meaningful delay to progression. Meanwhile, the rapalog
everolimus, was approved by FDA for subependymal giant
cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis com-
plex, another tumor predisposition syndrome with multiple
benign tumors requiring long-term tumor control [16].

Altogether, those data led us to conduct a single insti-
tution open-label phase II study to evaluate the tumor-
growth control activity and safety of everolimus in NF2
patients with VS.

Recently, targeted agents used in medical oncology have
been used to treat NF2-related VS. In two retrospective
studies, VEGF blockade with bevacizumab was followed
by hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage in more than
50 % of progressive VS in NF2 [6–8]. Effect on menin-
giomas seems modest [9, 10]. The main drawbacks of
bevacizumab are long-term side effects, particularly
hypertension and proteinuria, and the cumbersome needs
for intravenous infusion twice monthly [11]. Two Phase II
trials

Methods

Patients

Patients were recruited from our NF2 reference centre
between January and March 2012. Patients older than
15 years, fulﬁlling diagnostic criteria for NF2 (NIH 1988),
and with progressing VS were eligible. Progressing VS was
deﬁned as an increase in volume on MRI of at least 20 % in
the previous 12 months, in patients for whom surgery or
radiosurgery was not regarded as a primary option. In
addition, inclusion required compliance with the protocol,
and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions.

Main exclusion criteria were radiation therapy in target
lesions within 60 months preceding inclusion, long-term
therapy with systemic immunosuppressive agents including
corticoids, severe or uncontrolled medical conditions,
malignancies within 3 years prior enrolment, major surgery
or signiﬁcant traumatic injury within 4 weeks, pregnancy
or breast-feeding. Women of childbearing potential had to
use adequate contraception, and had to have a negative
pregnancy test before everolimus onset. The protocol was
approved by the IRB ‘‘CPP Ile de France 1’’ n° 2011-ju-
illet-12669. All participants provided written informed
consent before enrolment according to National and
International guidelines. The study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01490476.

Fig. 1 Study design. NF2 patients were enrolled based on C20 %
increase in VS volume during the year preceding the study and they
received a 12-month course of everolimus (10 mg/day). Tumor
volumetric evaluation was performed at 1 year. In case of response
(decrease in volume C20 %), patients were kept on treatment. In case
of stable disease (decrease/increase in volume \20 %), patients were

followed up by MRI every 3 months, and treatment was resumed if
tumor grew [20 % in volume. In case of progression (increase in
volume C20 %), tumor MRI analysis was performed at 24 months.
Surveillance modalities are depicted under the graph. ﬁlled circle all

Drug administration and safety

Study design is summarized in Fig. 1. Everolimus was
started at 10 mg/day on continuous daily dosing for one
year or until unacceptable toxicity. Adverse events were
graded using version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE). Dose reduction to
5 mg/day was permitted in patients who experienced tox-
icity. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed to check
for compliance and monitor plasma levels.

Radiological measurements of tumor volume

Imaging was done using a 1.5-T clinical MRI scanner
(Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Tumor tar-
get volume was assessed on three-dimensional gradient echo
Tl-weighted post-Gadolinium sequences with 0.7-mm slice
thickness, no gap, by manual segmentation in OsiriX 4.1.2
software (OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). Two investigators
(SG and ST) independently measured tumor volumes and
the mean of the two volumes was considered. When the
difference between the two measurements was C5 %, a joint
review was conducted to reach consensus. The primary
endpoint was the volume of the target VS at 12 months and
quoted as follows, compared to the baseline VS volume.
Response was deﬁned as C20 % reduction in tumor volume
from baseline. Progression was deﬁned as C20 % increase
in volume, and tumors that showed \20 % reduction and
[20 % increase in volume were categorized as stable [17].
In case of stable disease, everolimus was stopped and
patients were subsequently monitored every 3 months for

1 year, and treatment was resumed in case of VS growth
[20 %. Everolimus was discontinued in patients with pro-
gression and a follow up visit planned at M24. Volumetric
MRI at baseline, M12 and M24 also assessed all measurable
intracranial non-target tumors. Time to tumor progression
(TTP) was deﬁned as the interpolated time needed for a
tumor to increase in volume of 20 %, before and during
treatment.

Functional evaluation on hearing

Changes in hearing function were measured by pure tone
average (PTA) and speech discrimination scores (SDS).
PTA for each ear was the mean of the individual threshold
frequencies at 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz. An
increase of C10 dB in PTA between baseline and year-1
assessment values was considered hearing deterioration,
while a decrease by C10 dB indicated an improvement in
hearing. SDS was deﬁned as the best word recognition
score at presentation levels of up to 40 dB sensation level
or maximum comfortable loudness [18].

This study utilized the National Cancer Institute Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 for
grading toxicities (http://ctep.cancer.gov).

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis

Parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections from three VS resected
shortly after everolimus discontinuation (patients #3, #4,
#8) and from a control group of ten growing VS from sex-
and age-matched NF2 patients, were immunostained with

phospho-AKT (Ser473) and phospho-P70S6K (anti S6K1-
phospho S235 ? S236): Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and
Ki-67/Mib-1: Dako. Quantitative analysis was made by one
author (CM) [19, 20].

Statistical methods

Sample size was calculated using a single-stage A’Hern
design, under the null and alternative hypothesis for a
response rate of B5 and C45 %, respectively. The overall
Type I error was 0.05 with a power of 90 % [21]. Ten
patients were to be enrolled. Everolimus was to be consid-
ered effective if the number of responses was C3. Results
were given as median (inter quartile range), unless otherwise
speciﬁed. Progression rate at time T (PR) with respect to
inclusion time M0 (PR = 100 9 (VT - VM0)/VM0) was
calculated for all time-points of available MRI volumes
(between 2 and 4 before inclusion, and every 3 months
after), for nine patients. PR was compared between inter-
vention conditions periods, before treatment (the reference
period), and during treatment, using linear mixed effect
models (random intercept and slope) to account for repeated
measures over time [22, 23]. The model included time (in
month), period, and time-by-period interaction as ﬁxed
effect factors.

Results

Patient and tumor characteristics

Ten patients were enrolled between January and March
2012. Most patients were active young adults with NF2
whose baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. All ten
patients completed the 12-month treatment and were

evaluable for safety. One patient with a small intracana-
licular VS was not evaluable for assessment of tumor
volume on MRI, as the calculations could not reach con-
sensus on ﬁnal review analysis due to distortions of an ipsi-
lateral cochlear implant. However, this patient remained
evaluable for safety.

The median volume of target VS at inclusion was 4.0 cm3
(IQR 0.67–13), and the median growth rate between pre-
treatment MRI and M0 MRI was 34 % (IQR 26–49) for a
median time interval of 5.9 months (IQR 3.7–9.9).

Radiological evaluation of drug activity

After 12 months of treatment, no reduction in tumor vol-
ume C20 % was observed at 12 months (Fig. 2), and four
patients showed progression. Thus the study did not reach
the primary goal. Nevertheless, ﬁve patients had stable
disease with a median annual growth rate decreasing from
67 %/year (IQR 64–79) before treatment to 0.5 %/year
(IQR -6.5 to 17) during treatment with everolimus.

patients who were previously stable, showed a markedly
rapid increase of VS volume of 90, 36, and 25 % at
3 months, and one patient showed a 21 % volume expan-
sion at 6 months after everolimus discontinuation. Thus,
these four patients resumed everolimus, and at M24, VS
volumes were 4.3, -9, -17.7, and -4.5 %, compared to
the values before resuming the treatment.

represent ?20/-20 % tumor growth

For the four patients with progression, VS was partially

started in another one, and two patients were kept under
observation with continuous tumor growth (59 and 34 %/
year between M12 and M24).

In an unplanned secondary analysis, mixed effects mod-
els showed that the time-by-period interaction for PR was
highly signiﬁcant (P = 0.0004),
the PR
evolution was slower during treatment. Accordingly, med-
ian TTP was 4.2 months (IQR 2.9–5.8) before treatment,
and was not reached during the 12 months everolimus
therapy (Fig. 3). As previously reported in an index NF2
patient
treated with rapamycin [15], a concentration-
dependent response was observed. Everolimus blood trough
levels were higher in stable patients than in progressive
patients (median 22.7 lg/mL (IQR 16.5–30.2) versus 10.6
(IQR 9.7–15.5), P = 0.03 Mann–Whitney test).

Other per protocol evaluations of drug effects

Nine non-target lesions, including two contralateral VS, one
trigeminal schwannoma and six meningiomas were also
analyzed (see Online Resource 1). Everolimus treatment did
not induce tumor shrinkage, but seemed to delay the volu-
metric growth of all nine non-target lesions. In particular, the
median TTP of meningiomas was 5.5 months before ever-
olimus and increased to more than 12 months on treatment
(see Online Resource 2).

None of the patients experienced change in hearing
under treatment. SDS remained the same between M0 and
M12 (100 % except for patient #1, 0 %). PTA remained
stable except for patient #1 who experienced PTA decline
(from 82 to 120 dB) in a non-useful hearing ear (median
PTA 17 dB (IQR 9.5–29) at M0 vs. 18 dB (IQR 10–27) at
M12). After treatment discontinuation, two of four patients

3), associated with tumor growth. Re-introduction of ev-
erolimus was associated with a restoration of PTA to pre-
vious levels (15, 32, 6, and 27 dB at M24).

Toxicity

All ten enrolled subjects were available for toxicity mon-
itoring, and none was withdrawn due to serious adverse
events. No patient experienced grade 4–5 toxicities
(CTCAE 3.0). In one patient, dosage was decreased to
5 mg after 1 month because of grade 2 mouth ulcerations
considered non-tolerable by the patient. Observed toxicity
was otherwise mild to minor (grade 1–2), including mouth
ulcers (100 %), cholesterol elevation (90 %), rash (70 %),
headache (70 %), and fatigue (60 %), as commonly
described for this drug. One grade 3 toxicity was noted
consisting of a pathology-conﬁrmed basocellular carci-
noma that did not require further treatment.

Despite the small number of cases, the three VS that were

(patients # 3, 4, and 8) were analyzed. All three tumors were
benign schwannomas with no mitotic ﬁgures. Comparison
of S6K and AKT phosphorylation of these three VS to
archival VS samples from ten matching NF2 patients by IHC
showed that the rate of AKT phosphorylation was similar in
both groups, suggesting that VS growth was probably not
related to a feedback activation of AKT pathway (Fig. 4)
[24]. This is in line with our observation in schwannoma
mouse model, where a small increase in phospho-AKT seen
under rapamycin treatment normalized after treatment dis-
continuation [15]. The three VS exhibited marked elevated
S6 phosphorylation as observed in our mouse schwannoma
model, where tumor growth inhibition was dependent on
continuous exposure to rapamycin, with S6 phosphorylation
re-expression after rapamycin withdrawal.

Discussion

None of our nine patients treated with everolimus reached
the primary endpoint (C20 % reduction in tumor volume),
showing that everolimus does not induce VS shrinkage in
NF2 patients. However, in a secondary analysis putting
growth rate under treatment in the perspective of individual
growth rate before treatment and after treatment re intro-
duction, we observed evidences suggesting the potential for
everolimus to stabilize or delay tumor growth.

In fact, our preclinical study in a genetically engineered
mouse NF2 model recapitulating schwannoma natural history
was predictive of our current trial results: rapamycin signiﬁ-
cantly increased TTP by two-fold and was well tolerated over
an extended period of time [15]. The choice of tumor
shrinkage as the primary endpoint in our clinical study
determines the negative result of this study. Retrospectively,
this endpoint appeared as a far too stringent criterion for being
applied to a drug with cytostatic properties. TTP evaluation
could be more meaningful in future NF2 studies. Recently,
TTP has been used as the primary endpoint to assess the
activity of tiparﬁnib in a phase II trial in neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 [25]. This novel, randomized, double-blinded ﬂexible
crossover design ensures that all participants could receive the
drug, and that participants are kept on drug as long as no
objective tumor progression is evidenced. This type of trial
provides a sensitive and efﬁcient means of assessing a new
agent in a progressive disease with benign tumors.

Progressive hearing decline is a major concern in NF2
patients. Under everolimus treatment, hearing remained
stable. However, in published series, time to hearing decline
is 4.4 times slower than TTP and thus it would unlikely be
captured in a 2 year-study [26]. Longer follow up time will
be necessary for studies aimed to explore the effect of drug
treatments on hearing function in NF2 patients.

During the completion of the study, Karajannis et al.
published the results of a phase II study concluding that
everolimus was ineffective for the treatment of progressive
VS in nine NF2 patients [27]. In the Karajannis study, eight
of nine evaluable patients had previously received lapatinib
and/or bevacizumab that could have altered the biology of
tumors prior to everolimus treatment. In addition, the natural
history was not available for individuals before treatment.
This precludes the possibility of evaluating modulations of
TTP by everolimus and to capture a possible effect on tumor
stabilization. Of note, their inclusion criteria required pro-
gression of VS, deﬁned either on radiographic volumetric
data or on audiologic data, but the discrepancy between TTP
of these two criteria is too wide to aggregate them in a
composite criteria. Similarly, Karajannis et al. did not
observed a rebound effect after treatment cessation.

This rebound effect raises concern about the use of ev-
erolimus in NF2 patients. In Tuberous sclerosis complex,

319

another genetic disorder leading to constitutive activation of
mTORC1, sirolimus reduces the volume of angiomyolipo-
mas, with re-growth of tumors after discontinuation of
treatment [28]. In addition, mouse schwannoma regrowth
was observed upon cessation of therapy, consistent with the
cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects of rapamycin [15].
Interestingly, our in vitro experiments showed that inhibi-
tion of mTORC1 by rapamycin reduced the size of merlin-
deﬁcient schwannoma cells by an average of 10 %. This
observation could explain the frequent initial decrease of
tumor volume, before the cytostatic effect is elicited. Con-
sistent with this hypothesis, rapid tumor volumetric growth
following treatment withdrawal likely reﬂects a sudden
increase in cell size, accompanied by cell cycle re-entry and
cell proliferation (increased Ki-67). Upon reintroduction of
everolimus, VS stabilization was immediately resumed,
indicating that inhibition of mTORC1 had a direct inhibitory
effect on VS growth, which therefore cannot be ascribed to a
‘‘saltatory’’ VS progression pattern. A saltatory growth
pattern was described in a single retrospective analysis of
digitized MRI ﬁlms and has never been reported in any other
VS natural history series [29]. Based on our observation, we
do not recommend stopping everolimus treatment when it
led a stabilization of growing VS.

Our clinical evaluation of everolimus for NF2 is now in
the extension phase to assess whether tumor stabilization
can be safely maintained over a longer period of time (two
additional years) in the four stabilized patients.

Conclusion

In this study, everolimus did not induce shrinkage of VS, but
we have accumulated evidences for its effect on tumor sta-
bilization or growth delay that could be beneﬁcial for NF2
patients, especially early in disease course. Everolimus was
reasonably safe, and preserved hearing, avoiding surgery or
radiosurgery and their complications in patients with NF2.
Further assessment in a speciﬁcally designed trial, possibly
considering TTP as the primary endpoint, is now required.
