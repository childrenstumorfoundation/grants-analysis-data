Summary

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common neuro-
logical disorder caused by mutations in the gene en-
coding Neurofibromin, a p21Ras GTPase Activating
Protein (GAP) [1]. Importantly, NF1 causes learning
disabilities and attention deficits [2, 3]. A previous
study showed that the learning and memory deficits
of a mouse model of NF1 (nf1+/−) appear to be caused
by excessive p21Ras activity leading to impairments
in long-term potentiation (LTP) [4], a cellular mecha-
nism of learning and memory [5–7]. Here, we identify
lovastatin as a potent inhibitor of p21Ras/Mitogen
Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity [8, 9] in the
brain. Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of three-hydroxy-
3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase,
used commonly for the treatment of hypercholester-
olemia [10]. We report that lovastatin decreased the en-
hanced brain p21Ras-MAPK activity of the nf1+/− mice,
rescued their LTP deficits, and reversed their spatial
learning and attention impairments. Therefore, these
results demonstrate that lovastatin may prove useful
in the treatment of Neurofibromatosis Type 1.

Results and Discussion

The key pathophysiologic mechanism underlying NF1
mutations in both mice [4, 11–13] and humans [14, 15]
is increased p21Ras activity. Therapeutic interventions
designed to inhibit p21Ras function have been pro-
posed as treatments of NF1 [16]. Posttranslational farn-
esylation is required for the membrane localization and
function of p21Ras, and farnesylation provides a poten-
tial target for NF1 pharmacotherapy [17]. Indeed, phar-
macologic inhibitors of farnesyltransferase downregu-
late p21Ras activity. It is unknown, however, whether
any of these inhibitors have the in vivo pharmacokinet-
ics, biodistribution, and safety profile required for the
long-term treatment of cognitive dysfunction in NF1 [18].
Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting en-
zyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG-CoA reduc-
tase), is widely used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans

[19]. Previous studies have shown that lovastatin can
inhibit p21Ras isoprenylation and activity [8, 20]. Since
the cognitive deficits caused by mutations in the NF1
gene may result from increased p21Ras activity, we hy-
pothesized that lovastatin could rescue these deficits.
The NF1 null mutation mouse is lethal as a homozy-
gote but is viable as a heterozygote [13]. Interestingly,
we have not detected neuroanatomic deficits in the
nf1+/− mice, although they do display a range of behav-
ioral abnormalities that parallel the cognitive profile as-
sociated with NF1 patients [1].

We analyzed the effect of lovastatin treatment on
p21Ras/MAPK by using Western blotting. nf1+/− mice
and wild-type littermate controls (wt) were injected with
10 mg/kg lovastatin subcutaneously once per day for 4
days, and they were sacrificed on the 4th day, 6 hr after
the final injection. Levels of p44/42 were examined in
both cortex and hippocampus by SDS-PAGE. Proteins
were transferred to membranes and hybridized with
anti-phospho p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling) antibody.
The results in Figure 1A show that the levels of phos-
phorylated p44/42 MAPK are higher in both the cortex
(p < 0.05) and hippocampus (p < 0.05) of nf1+/− mice
compared to wt. Several days of treatment with 10 mg/
kg of lovastatin decreased the levels of phosphorylated
p44/42 MAPK in nf1+/− mice, resulting in roughly equal
amounts of phosphorylated p44/p42 MAPK as wt (cor-
tex: p = 0.759, hippocampus: p = 0.850). Sample load-
ing was controlled by reprobing the nitrocellulose mem-
branes used for
the analysis with an anti-p44/42
MAPK antibody.

Neurofibromin functions as a p21Ras GTPase-activa-
ting protein that catalyzes the conversion of active GTP
bound p21Ras to the inactive GDP bound form. We
therefore examined the impact of lovastatin treatment
on p21Ras activity directly. Cortical and hippocampal
extracts were reacted with GST-Raf1-RBD beads
(Pierce Bio), which specifically bind p21Ras-GTP, the
active form of p21Ras. p21Ras-GTP was resolved by
SDS-PAGE and visualized with an anti-pan p21Ras
antibody (Sigma). Again, p21Ras-GTP levels were ele-
vated in the nf1+/− compared to wt for both cortex (p <
0.05) and hippocampus (p < 0.05). Lovastatin treatment
decreased the levels of p21Ras-GTP in both the cortex
and hippocampus of nf1+/− to the level of wt mice (cor-
tex: p = 0.789, hippocampus: p = 0.195) (Figure 1B).
This result is consistent with decreased levels of MAPK
activity that we found in nf1+/− mice. Altogether, these
data demonstrate that lovastatin can decrease p21Ras/
MAPK activity in the cortex and hippocampus and may
therefore be useful to treat cognitive deficits of the
nf1+/− mice.

NF1 in humans is associated with a broad spectrum
of cognitive profiles, which may include learning disa-
bilities, attentional disorders, and altered visuospatial
skills [2, 3, 21, 22]. We examined the effect of lovastatin
on nf1+/− mice in a variety of behavioral and cognitive
tests to assess how the loss of NF1 impacted on these
behaviors and whether lovastatin could rescue any ob-
served deficits.

Figure 1. Downregulation of p21Ras-MAPK Activity in nf1+/− Mice by Lovastatin
(A) Lovastatin was effective at decreasing active MAPK in the nf1+/− mice (4–9 mice per group).
(B) Lovastatin also decreased active p21Ras (p21Ras-GTP) in nf1+/− mice (6–7 mice for each group). Error bars represent ± one standard error.

To investigate altered attentional function in the nf1+/−
mice, we used the lateralized reaction-time task, a test
that measures divided visuospatial attention and is de-
pendent upon prefrontal cortex. Animals nosepoke to
trigger the delivery of a visual target stimulus on one
side of their visual field. The spatial location and time
of onset of the target is unpredictable and so attention
must be distributed across space and time. The task
difficulty is altered by changing the duration that the
target stimulus is visible. Wild-type and nf1+/− mice
were tested with lovastatin (nf1+/− = 7, wt = 7) or pla-
cebo (nf1+/− = 14, wt = 10). The rate of correct re-
sponses (an index of attention accuracy) revealed a
genotype × treatment × target stimulus duration in-
teraction (ANOVA, F2,70 = 3.200, p < 0.05). The correct

response rate of wt mice was significantly higher than
that of nf1+/− mice (PLSD, p < 0.05; Figure 2A) at the
most difficult stimulus duration (0.5 s), indicating that
the nf1+/− mice have impaired attentional function.

In contrast, the performance of nf1+/− mice treated
with lovastatin was indistinguishable from that of wt
mice at a target stimulus duration of 0.5 s (PLSD, p =
0.148; Figure 2B) and was significantly higher than
nf1+/− given placebo (PLSD, p < 0.05). These data dem-
onstrate that nf1+/− mice exhibit substantial attention
deficits and that
lovastatin treatment can reverse
these deficits.

We have previously shown that nf1+/− mice have ab-
normal spatial learning tested in the hidden version of
the water maze [4, 23], a task that is sensitive to lesions

Figure 2. Rescue by Lovastatin of Attention Deficits in nf1+/− Mice
(A) nf1+/− mice have deficits compared to wt animals in the 0.5 ms target stimulus duration condition of the lateralized reaction time test. The
deficit is rescued by lovastatin treatment.
(B) The deficit is seen only at the most difficult interval. Longer intervals produce equivalent performance between the groups (wt = 10,
nf1+/− = 14, wt with lovastatin = 7, nf1+/− with lovastatin = 7). Error bars represent ± one standard error.

of the hippocampus and multiple cortical sites includ-
ing retrosplenial, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal corti-
ces, and the cingulum bundle [24–27]. To test the hy-
pothesis that
lovastatin can rescue the deficits of
nf1+/− mice in this task, we injected 10 mg/kg lovastatin
subcutaneously for 3 days before the first training day,
and then 6 hr before behavioral training daily. Mice were
trained with two trials per day. No differences were ob-
served between genotypes and/or treatment groups in
measures of acquisition, floating, thigmotaxic behavior,
or swimming speed (data not shown).

Spatial learning was assessed in probe trials given at
the end of water maze training on days 5 and 7, since
previous studies have shown that probe trial perfor-
mance is the most faithful measure of spatial learning
in the Morris maze [28]. In the probe trials, the platform
was removed from the pool and the mice were allowed
to search for it for 60 s. Neither genotype had learned
the task by the day 5 probe (Figure 3A). Differences
emerged between the genotypes and treatments
(ANOVA, F1,82 = 4.415, p < 0.05) after 2 more days of
training. Wild-type mice spent significantly more time
than nf1+/− mice
searching in the target quadrant
(PLSD, p < 0.05; Figure 3B), confirming that the nf1+/−

mutants have impaired spatial learning. In contrast, the
mutants treated with lovastatin spent as much time as
wt in the target quadrant (p = 0.862; Figure 3B) and
significantly more time than mutants given placebo (p <
0.05). These results demonstrate that the spatial learn-
the nf1+/− mice are not caused by
ing deficits of
irreversible developmental abnormalities since they are
reversed with acute lovastatin treatment in adult mu-
tant mice.

Previous studies report a high incidence of attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in NF1 patients
and support an association between ADHD and learn-
ing problems in these children [2, 29]. Children with
ADHD are reported to have significantly reduced pre-
pulse inhibition (PPI) [30]. PPI assays sensory “gating”
of environmental stimuli. A sudden acoustic stimulus
will normally elicit a whole-body startle response. If the
startle-producing stimulus is preceded by a weak
prestimulus, the startle response is inhibited in normal
persons and animals [31]. We tested whether nf1+/−
mice have deficits in this task and whether these defi-
cits could also be reversed by lovastatin treatment (as
described above). A two-way repeated measures
ANOVA revealed significant main effects of genotype

and treatment (Figure 4). The nf1+/− animals have defi-
cient PPI (F1,30 = 7.42, p < 0.05), and lovastatin treat-
ment resulted in an increase in performance (F1,30 =
6.61, p < 0.05). Importantly, the performance of nf1+/−
animals on lovastatin is indistinguishable from that of
wt animals on placebo (PLSD, p = 0.877), demonstrat-
ing that lovastatin can reverse the PPI deficits of these
mutants. The increased PPI of the wt animals on lova-
statin may be attributed to Ras inhibition. Current mod-

PPI was examined via prepulses at three different stimulus inten-
sities (70, 75, and 80 dB) (wt = 8, nf1+/− = 8, wt with lovastatin = 9,

poses, error bars (standard error of the mean) are shown in only
one direction. Representative traces are shown from left to right:

els of PPI attribute the mechanism to a presynaptic in-
hibition of release [32]. Given that Ras activity is known
to increase presynaptic release of transmitter [33], the
effects of lovastatin and PPI would work in concert to
decrease presynaptic release. In the case of the nf1+/−
mutants, which have upregulated Ras function, the de-
crease merely brings them back into the normal range.
In wt animals, release would be greatly curtailed, result-
ing in the enhancement of PPI.

We have previously shown that the learning deficits
of the nf1+/− mice are likely caused by impairments in
LTP [4], a stable long-lasting change in synaptic
strength widely believed to be a key cellular mecha-
nism for learning and memory that is dependent upon
Ras/MAPK function [5–7, 34]. We therefore determined
whether the LTP deficits in nf1+/− mice could be re-
versed by lovastatin. Mice were injected with 10 mg/kg
of lovastatin as described above. We examined LTP in
hippocampal slices at the Schaffer collateral/CA1 syn-
apse, since LTP at this synapse has served as a model
system for associative changes in synaptic strength
between neurons [5–7]. LTP was measured after a 5
theta-burst stimulation protocol (TBS, five bursts 200
ms apart, each burst of 4 pulses at 100 Hz), which mim-
ics in vivo activity of hippocampal neurons during ex-
ploratory behavior [35]. Figure 5 shows that there was
a difference among the genotypes and treatments
(ANOVA, F1,26 = 8.55, p < 0.05). The LTP measured in
nf1+/− mutants was significantly lower than in wt mice
(PLSD, p < 0.05; Figure 5), a result consistent with pre-
viously published findings [4]. The amount of LTP in-
duced in nf1+/− mutants treated with lovastatin was sig-

nificantly higher than that induced in mutants (PLSD,
p < 0.05; Figure 5) and equivalent to that of wt (PLSD,
p = 0.602; Figure 5). These data demonstrate that the
lovastatin treatment completely reversed the LTP defi-
cits of the nf1+/− mice.

The present results demonstrate that lovastatin treat-
ment can reverse the biochemical, electrophysiologi-
cal, and cognitive deficits observed in a mouse model
of NF1 and that these deficits are not due to irreversible
developmental changes. Previous studies have shown
that an increase in p21Ras activity is central to the
pathophysiology associated with NF1 [16], and our bio-
chemical data demonstrate that lovastatin reverses the
abnormally elevated p21Ras/MAPK activity in an ani-
mal model of NF1. Importantly, our studies demon-
strated that the dose of lovastatin that is effective in
nf1+/− mice did not affect cognitive function in control
mice, a result consistent with randomized studies per-
formed with human subjects that did not identify a reli-
able effect of lovastatin on cognitive function [36, 37].
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that there are sporadic
reports that statins can be associated with mild cogni-
tive impairment [38]. Altogether, the studies reported
here demonstrate that the cognitive deficits associated
with NF1 can be reversed by treatments with lovastatin,
a widely prescribed drug that is known to be well toler-
ated even in long-term treatments. Thus, these data
suggest that lovastatin could be used to treat the cog-
nitive impairments associated with Neurofibromatosis
Type 1 in humans.

Experimental Procedures

Animal Experiments
All animal protocols were approved by the Chancellor’s Animal Re-
search Committee at the University of California at Los Angeles, in
accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines.
Studies were performed in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrids
generated by an F1 cross between nf1+/− mice (maintained in the
C57BL/6 background for more than 11 generations) and wild-type
mice on the 129T2/SvEmsJ background with wild-type littermates
used as controls. All experiments were carried out blind with re-
spect to genotype and treatment.

Lovastatin Solution and Pellet
Because of the extended nature of the lateralized reaction time
task (see below), lovastatin was administered orally as pellets,
while in other tasks lovastatin was injected in the lactone form.
Mevinolin (lovastatin, Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol, then incu-
bated at room temperature in 1N NaOH and water to mevinolin to
the sodium salt. The final mevinolin solution (4 mg/ml) was adjusted
to pH 7.5 with HCl [10, 39]. Pellets for oral administration were
prepared by mixing crushed lovastatin tablets (Eon Labs) (prescrip-
tion formulation) with melted peanut butter chips (H.B. Reese
Candy Co.). The mixture was molded into 200 mg pellets containing
0.15 mg Lovastatin and were administered to mice once daily.

Western Blot Analysis for p44/42 MAP Kinase
Phosphorylation and p21Ras Activity
Cortical and hippocampal regions from 4 to 7 control and lova-
statin-treated mice were isolated and homogenized in protein ex-
traction buffer. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation, and
products were separated by electrophoresis on a 4%–15% gradi-
ent or 12% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gels were blotted
to nitrocellulose membranes and then blocked for 1 hr at room
temperature with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% (v/v)
Tween-20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. After washing in TBST,
membranes were hybridized at room temperature with anti-phos-

pho-p44/42 (Cell Signaling) antibody diluted 1:1000 in the blocking
solution. The membranes were visualized with the ECL Plus proto-
col (Amersham BioSciences) and quantified by a Storm System
phosphor imager (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped
in stripping buffer and reprobed with anti-p44/42 (Cell Signaling) as
a control for protein loading. The amount of phosphorylated p44/
42 was expressed as a ratio of total p44/42. Other groups were
normalized to the wt ratio.

For p21Ras activity assay, p21Ras pull-down experiments were
performed with the EZ-detect p21Ras activation kit (Pierce Bio-
technology), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 25 ␮l of
sample per lane was loaded on SDS-PAGE. p21Ras-GTP was de-
tected and quantified by Western blotting as described via an anti-
pan-p21Ras antibody (Sigma). The ratio of Ras-GTP in each group
was normalized to wt.

Lateralized Reaction Time Task
Animals (placebo-treated: nf1+/− = 14, wt = 10; lovastatin treated:
nf1+/− = 7, wt = 7) were food deprived to 90% of their free-feeding
weights. Mice were trained in a miniaturized versions of a “5-
choice” box (Med Associates, St Albans, VT). The chamber was
equipped with a horizontal array of five apertures that could be
internally illuminated and the opposite wall was fitted with a pellet
magazine for reward delivery. Animals were shaped to produce a
“poke and hold” response in the central aperture during which a
side aperture would be illuminated. A correct response was scored
when the animals correctly poked the aperture that had been illumi-
nated. Animals that did not perform at 75% accuracy at 1 s target
stimulus duration during the training phase were dropped. Mice
were tested on a variable duration condition in which the target
aperture was illuminated for 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 s (varied within session).
We measured correct responses/total trials, which vary as a func-
tion of the target stimulus duration and was therefore analyzed by
use of stimulus duration as a repeated measure [40].

Water Maze
The basic protocol for the water maze experiments has been pre-
viously described [11]. Mice from the 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57B/6 F1
genetic background were given two trials per day (30 s intertrial
intervals) with a probe trial (60 s) at the end of training days 5 and
7. Mice were given subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg lovastatin
or vehicle for 3 days before the first training day and then 6 hr
before training every day.

Prepulse Inhibition
Mice were food deprived as described above. 5 min after place-
ment in the conditioning chamber, mice were presented with 20
noise bursts (40 ms duration, 120 dB, <1 ms rise/fall time). In the
prepulse inhibition phase, mice were presented with a total of 90
trials (30 trials each at 70, 75, and 80 dB). For each prepulse inten-
sity (20 ms duration, <1 ms rise/fall time), there were three types of
trial: prepulse alone, prepulse/startle stimulus, and startle stimulus
alone. In the prepulse/startle stimulus trial, the onset of the pre-
pulse preceded the onset of the startle stimulus by 100 ms. Back-
ground noise levels were maintained at 68 dB throughout testing,
and the trials were spaced 15 s [41].

Hippocampal LTP
Transverse hippocampal slices (400 mm thick) were placed in a
submerged recording chamber perfused (2 ml/min) with ACSF con-
taining 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCL, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM D-glucose at 34°C.
Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded
with a Pt/Ir electrode (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME) from the stratum
radiatum layer of the area CA1 elicited by stimulation of the Schaf-
fer collateral/commissural afferents by two bipolar electrodes
placed 300 ␮m on either side of the recording electrode. Test
pulses of 60 ␮A alternated between the two electrodes every min-
ute throughout the duration of the experiment. After 20 min of sta-
ble baseline, LTP was induced via a TBS protocol as described in
the text delivered to the test pathway. Multiple slices from a single
animal were averaged and entered into analysis as a single subject.

The responses from the last 10 min block of recordings (40–50 min)
were compared for statistical tests.

Statistical Analysis
Western blots were analyzed with the one-sample t test (mean =
100, one tail upper). We analyzed percent time in training quadrant
for the different genotypes from the water maze by using 2-way
ANOVA. Attention data was analyzed with three-way repeated-
measures ANOVA on the average of correct response rate. PPI data
was analyzed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. For the
electrophysiological experiments, the significance of differences
between the groups was determined by two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc
comparisons (Fisher’s PLSD) between groups were carried out
where appropriate.
