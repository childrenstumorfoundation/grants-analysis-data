Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are increasingly recognized as having a high prevalence of social difficulties and 
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We demonstrated a selective social learning deficit in mice with deletion of a single Nf1 
allele (Nf1+/−), along with greater activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in neurons from the amygdala and 
frontal cortex, structures that are relevant to social behaviors. The Nf1+/− mice showed aberrant amygdala glutamate and GABA 
neurotransmission, deficits in long-term potentiation and specific disruptions in the expression of two proteins that are associated 
with glutamate and GABA neurotransmission: a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 22 (Adam22) and heat shock protein 70 
(Hsp70), respectively. All of these amygdala disruptions were normalized by the additional deletion of the p21 protein-activated 
kinase (Pak1) gene. We also rescued the social behavior deficits in Nf1+/− mice with pharmacological blockade of Pak1 directly in 
the amygdala. These findings provide insights and therapeutic targets for patients with NF1 and ASDs.

Affecting roughly 1 in 3,000 children worldwide, NF1 is one of the 
most common single-gene disorders, resulting in the development 
of complex tumors known as neurofibromas and marked cognitive 
and learning disabilities1,2. A number of studies have demonstrated 
deficits in social information processing and social behaviors in over 
50% of patients with NF1 (refs. 3–6), with 20–30% of patients reach-
ing the severity of clinical diagnosis of ASD7–9. Further analyses of 
these social deficits in patients with NF1 suggested that they also have 
problems in facial emotional recognition (especially fear), a task that 
is linked specifically to human amygdala function6,10.

Thus, NF1 mutation presents an important single-gene disruption 
model that could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for 
social learning deficits and the pathophysiology of ASDs. Social learn-
ing is the product of complex interactions between multiple structures 
in the CNS, particularly the amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, fusi-
form area and frontal cortex11–13. Using homologous recombination 
to disrupt the mouse homolog of NF1 (Nf1), we found that loss of a 
single Nf1 allele in mice (Nf1+/− mice) reduced neurofibromin levels 
in multiple organs, recapitulating the phenotypes of the human con-
dition14. Specifically, this alteration caused deficits in some forms of 
spatial learning, as well as disrupted hippocampal long-term poten-
tiation (LTP)15,16. In addition to effects in the hippocampus, Nf1+/− 
mice also showed similar reductions in neurofibromin levels in the 
amygdala and frontal cortex, CNS sites that are critical for social 

behaviors and emotional regulation. Therefore, we conducted the 
present study to test whether Nf1+/− mice demonstrate disruptions 
in social behaviors and elucidate the cellular or molecular changes in 
CNS sites that are associated with social behaviors.

RESULTS
Nf1+/− mice show social learning deficits and hyperactivation of 
Mapk in the brain
To determine whether Nf1+/− mice demonstrate disrupted social learn-
ing, we used a well-validated three-chamber social memory test17. 
On initial exposure to the testing apparatus, both wild-type (WT) 
and Nf1+/− mice spent significantly more time interacting with an 
unfamiliar mouse over an inanimate object (n = 12, 12 (WT, Nf1+/−); 
side-preference effect F1,22 = 105.8, P < 0.001, but no Nf1+/− interac-
tion F1,22 = 0.9, P = 0.358; Fig. 1a), demonstrating that the Nf1+/− 
genotype does not affect conspecific social cue recognition in mice 
(we labeled this as the baseline social behavior). After a 10-min inter-
val, we retested the mice with a choice between a novel mouse and the 
previous familiar mouse to assess their short-term social memory18. 
Mice from both the WT and Nf1+/− genotypes spent significantly  
more time with the new mouse (n = 12, 12; side preference effect  
F1,22 = 105.8, P < 0.001, but no Nf1+/− interaction F1,22 = 0.4, P = 0.554; 
Fig. 1b), suggesting that Nf1+/− mice show a normal ability to discrim-
inate and immediately recall social cues. However, when presented

with yet another novel mouse and the previously familiar mouse 24 h  
later, the Nf1+/− mice did not show increased exploration of the novel 
mouse compared to the familiar mouse, whereas the WT mice showed 
robust preference for the novel mouse (n = 12, 11; side preference 
effect F1,21 = 9.9, P = 0.005, and an Nf1+/− interaction F1,21 = 5.3,  
P = 0.032; Fig. 1c,d). These results indicate that Nf1+/− mice, although 
showing normal immediate social discrimination at baseline, were 
unable to retain or recall the social memory and discriminate between 
familiar and unfamiliar social cues after a 24-h delay.

To determine whether this deficit was selective for social learning 
or was generalized to other amygdala-cortical circuits, we also tested 
the performance of Nf1+/− mice in other novelty and emotional learn-
ing paradigms. We confirmed that compared to WT mice, Nf1+/− mice 
did not demonstrate deficits in learning in a novel object recogni-
tion test (n = 5, 5; object preference effect F1,8 = 8.9, P = 0.017, but 
no Nf1+/− interaction; Fig. 1e) or in avoidance learning in a passive 
avoidance test (n = 9, 6; avoidance effect F1,13 = 16.1, P = 0.001, but 
no Nf1+/− interaction; Fig. 1f). We also tested the ability of the mice to 
demonstrate innate avoidance 24 hours after exposure to a fear stimu-
lus by using the elevated plus maze, as described previously19. When 
we tested mice 24 h later, both genotypes showed similar increases in 
the avoidance of the open arms, suggesting normal retention of mem-
ory for aversive cues and avoidance in both genotypes (n = 12, 12;  
a day effect for duration F1,22 = 10.1, P = 0.003 and entries F1,22 = 11.5,  
P = 0.003 in the open arms, but no Nf1+/− interactions; Fig. 1g,h). 
Similarly, using the Porsolt forced swim test, we measured the devel-
opment of behavioral despair 24 h after the swim stress test in the 
Nf1+/− mice. The WT and Nf1+/− mice both showed normal learning 

in the forced swim test (n = 12, 12; day effect F1,22 = 5.1, P = 0.034, 
but no Nf1+/− interaction; Fig. 1i). We also tested the Nf1+/− mice for 
differences in ability to discriminate olfactory cues, another possible 
confounder that could result in mice showing poor social learning. In 
a standardized olfactory habituation test, both WT and Nf1+/− mice 
demonstrated similar learning (n = 6, 6; water: test effect F2,20 = 15.2, 
P < 0.001; almond: test effect F2,20 = 7.4, P = 0.004; novel mouse: test 
effect F2,20 = 37.1, P < 0.001; no Nf1+/− interactions; Fig. 1j). Thus, 
Nf1+/− mice appeared to have selective and circumscribed deficits in 
long-term retention of social information.

The  NF1  gene  encodes  neurofibromin,  which  negatively  regu-
lates Ras GTPase activation (a hypothetical illustration is shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 1a). Mutation at the Nf1 locus increases the output 
of Mapk and Pi3k signal transduction from the cellular membrane to 
the nucleus, resulting in the hyperactivation of the products of its down-
stream pathways, such as phosphorylated Erk (pErk)20,21. Therefore, 
we first tested whether neurons cultured from Nf1+/− mice displayed 
a similar hyperactivation of Mapk after growth factor stimulation. 
Application of recombinant murine stem cell factor (SCF; 10 ng/ml)  
increased the levels of pErk1 and pErk2 (pErk1/2) to a significantly 
greater  degree  in  frontal  cortical  neurons  cultured  from  Nf1+/−

of the amygdala in WT and Nf1+/− mice after exposure to a novel 
mouse. Compared to WT mice, Nf1+/− mice had increased numbers of 
pErk-immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA; t9 = 3.2,  
P = 0.010) but not the medial amygdala (n = 5, 6; t9 = 1.2, P = 0.262; 
Fig. 1l), further demonstrating the hyperactivity of MAPK pathways 
in neurons responding to a social cue.

Deletion of Pak1 restores long-term social deficits in Nf1+/− mice
PAK1 is a downstream effector that is regulated by the Rho family 
of GTPases and positively regulates MAPK activation, and deletion 
of the Pak1 gene in mice (Pak1−/−) could potentially normalize the 
hyperactivation of Mapk pathways seen in Nf1+/− mice, as has been 
demonstrated previously in macrophages22 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).  
To confirm that this approach could normalize social learning deficits 
in Nf1+/− mice, we tested whether genetic intercross (Nf1+/− Pak1−/−) 
would restore the learning deficits seen in Nf1+/− mice. We found that 
the Nf1+/−, Nf1+/− Pak1−/− and Pak1−/− strains showed no differences  
in baseline social preference (n = 12, 11, 6; side preference effect F1,26 = 100.5,  
P  <  0.001,  but  no  genotype  interaction;  Fig.  2a)  or  short-term 
social  learning  (n  =  12,  11,  6;  side  preference  effect F1,26  =  32.7,  
P < 0.001, but no genotype interaction; Fig. 2b). As in the analyses 
described above, we observed deficits in Nf1+/− mice in long-term  

social learning, but notably, deletion of Pak1−/− in Nf1+/− mice (Nf1+/− 
Pak1−/−) clearly restored this learning deficit (n = 12, 11, 6; side pref-
erence effect F1,26 = 7.5, P = 0.011, and a genotype × side prefer-
ence interaction that approached significance F1,26 = 3.3, P = 0.054; 
a Fisher’s exact test determined that Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice showed a 
greater novel mouse preference (≥10 s criteria) than Nf1+/− mice,  
P = 0.036; Fig. 2c,d). Similar to our previous results with  Nf1+/−

activity in WT mice and how disruption of Adam22 in Nf1+/− mice interrupts anchoring of AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane and leads to 
nonsustainable LTP (as demonstrated in Fig. 3h). Similarly, increased expression of Hsp70 could contribute to increases in presynaptic GABA release 
and an increased frequency of IPSCs (seen in Fig. 3c). Statistical analyses in a–c were performed by two-way ANOVA with genotypes as the main 
factors, and those in d and e were performed by unpaired two-tailed t test.

tion (n = 12, 11, 6; test 1–3 effects were noted for water F2,30 = 12.2,  
P < 0.001, almond F2,30 = 23.2, P < 0.001 and novel mouse F2,30 = 26.3,  
P < 0.001, but not genotype interactions; Fig. 2g) between the Nf1+/− 
and Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice. Although despair-associated behaviors were 
not different between WT and Nf1+/− mice (Fig. 1i), compared to Nf1+/−  
mice,  the  Nf1+/−  Pak1−/−  and  Pak1−/−  mice  had  reduced  despair- 
associated immobility (n = 12, 11, 6; genotype effect F2,26 = 6.9, P = 0.004 
and day effect F2,26 = 9.2, P = 0.005, but no genotype interaction; Fig. 2f).  
Overall, these results show that constitutive Pak1 deletion could res-
cue the social learning deficits in Nf1+/− mice.

Deletion of Pak1 rescues disrupted amygdala network and LTP 
in Nf1+/− mice
Because the amygdala is important in social learning11–13 and we 
observed hyperactivity of Mapk pathways in BLA neurons of Nf1+/− 
mice after novel mouse exposure (Fig. 1l), we next assessed func-
tional  changes  in  the  amygdala  networks  in  WT,  Nf1+/−,  Nf1+/− 
Pak1−/− and Pak1−/− mice. Using whole-cell patch clamp from BLA 
principal neurons, we studied spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory 
postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs, respectively). Whereas 
pyramidal neurons of the BLA from Nf1+/− mice exhibited no dif-
ferences in the amplitudes of either sIPSCs (n = 4, 4, 3, 3 mice per 
genotype  and  n  =  11,  11,  14,  14  cells  patched  per  genotype;  no 
Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,46 = 0.1, P = 0.77; Fig. 3a,b) or mini-
ature IPSCs (mIPSCs) (no Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,46 = 0.3,  
P = 0.59; Fig. 3a,b), they did show significant increases in the fre-
quencies of both sIPSCs (Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,46 = 6.11, 
P  =  0.017;  Fig.  3a,c)  and  mIPSCs  (Nf1+/−  ×  Pak1−/−  interaction 

F1,46 = 9.21, P = 0.004; Fig. 3a,c) compared to those from WT mice. 
Furthermore, deletion of Pak1 completely normalized the increase in 
frequency in Nf1+/− mice without affecting the amplitude of sIPSCs 
and mIPSCs in the amygdala neurons (Fig. 3a–c), confirming that 
Pak1 deletion also restores the increased BLA network inhibitory 
activity induced by Nf1 mutation.

Next we analyzed both sEPSCs and mEPSCs from pyramidal neu-
rons in the BLA of Nf1+/− mice and found significant increases in 
the frequency of sEPSCs (Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,62 = 4.53, 
P = 0.037) and mEPSCs (Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,56 = 3.99,  
P = 0.05) but not in the amplitude of sEPSCs (no Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− 
interaction F1,62 = 2.68, P = 0.107) or mEPSCs (n = 4, 4, 3, 3 mice per  
genotype  and  n  =  11,  11,  14,  14  cells  patched  per  genotype;  no  
Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,56 = 1.03, P = 0.314; Fig. 3d–f). We 
detected additional significant increases in the amplitude of sEPSCs 
(Pak1−/− effect F1,62 = 76.63, P < 0.0001) and mEPSCs (Pak1−/− effect 
F1,56 = 148.7, P < 0.0001) in Pak1−/− and Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice. These 
network changes suggest increases in presynaptic GABA release in the 
BLA of Nf1+/− mice, similar to findings in the hippocampus16. However, 
unlike in the hippocampus, there appeared to be additional changes in 
glutamate neurotransmission in the amygdalas of Nf1+/− mice.

To determine whether changes in synaptic plasticity within the 
amygdala might account for the social learning impairments of the 
Nf1+/− mutants, we examined LTP in BLA slices from these mice. 
Using a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol23, we elicited per-
sistent potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in 
WT mice that lasted at least 60 min after stimulation. In the Nf1+/− 
mice, although the initial potentiation was comparable to that in WT 
neurons, we observed a significant decay over the time (n = 6, 6, 4, 
4 mice per genotype and n = 7, 12, 8, 5 cells patched per genotype;

Fig. 3g–i). By 50 min after stimulation, the amplitude of EPSPs was no 
longer significantly different from those recorded 5 min before TBS 
in Nf1+/− mice (Nf1+/− effect over time F14,392 = 0.6, P = 0.838). In 
contrast, LTP induced in Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice was equivalent to that 
in the WT mice (genotype × time interaction F42,392 = 3.2, P < 0.001; 
Fig. 3g–i). The amplitude of the EPSPs induced by TBS in Pak1−/− 
mice was comparable to the amplitude of EPSPs recorded from BLA 
neurons of WT mice (Pak1−/− effect over time F14,392 = 3.8, P < 0.001; 
Fig. 3g–i). These results show that Nf1+/− mice had disrupted amy-
gdala LTP and that Pak1 deletion can rescue these LTP deficits.

Nf1+/− mice, and all of these alterations were rescued by Pak1 dele-
tion. Using immunocytochemistry, we further confirmed that there 
was a significant reduction in the number of Adam22-positive cells 
only (n = 5, 7, 6, 6; Nf1+/− effect F1,24 = 7.1, P = 0.015, Pak1−/− effect 
F1,24 = 6.7, P = 0.018; Fig. 4c,f), whereas the numbers of cells positive 
for Cap1 (t9 = −1.0, P = 0.337) or Hsp70 (t9 = −0.3, P = 0.748) were 
unaltered (n = 4, 6, with one outlier removed from WT group, and  
n = 4, 7, respectively; Fig. 4d,e) in the BLA of Nf1+/− mice compared 
to WT mice. This reduction in Adam22-positive cells was also rescued 
in the Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice.

Pak1 deletion corrects altered amygdala synaptic proteins in 
Nf1+/− mice
We next used mass spectrometry to measure the expression levels 
of synaptic and neuronal proteins in the amygdalas of WT, Nf1+/−, 
Nf1+/− Pak1−/− and Pak1−/− mice. We first identified proteins that 
were changed in Nf1+/− compared to WT mice and then determined 
which of those altered proteins were specifically restored in Nf1+/− 
Pak1−/− mice without being similarly altered by deletion of the Pak1 
gene alone. The group of proteins thus identified would likely be 
the key to the disruption of the amygdala network observed in the 
Nf1+/− mice. On the basis of our selection algorithm, out of the 380 
proteins measured, we identified only 3 in the BLA that met all three 
selection criteria, i.e., they were disrupted in Nf1+/− compared to WT 
mice (criteria one, 73 proteins; Supplementary Table 1), they were 
not changed in Pak1−/−compared to WT mice (criteria 2), and they 
were rescued to near WT levels in Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice (n = 6, 6, 6, 6; 
Table 1). There was a substantial, nearly 85% loss of Adam22 levels 
(Nf1+/− effect F1,24 = 28.3, P < 0.001 and Pak1−/− effect F1,24 = 4.4,  
P  =  0.048;  Fig.  4a),  along  with  a  300%  increase  in  the  levels  of  
cyclase-associated  protein  (Cap1)  (Nf1+/−  ×  Pak1−/−  interaction  
F1,23 = 10.0, P = 0.005; Fig. 4a) and a 70% increase in Hsp70 levels 
(Nf1+/− × Pak1−/− interaction F1,24 = 5.9, P = 0.025; Fig. 4b) in the 

Local Pak1 inhibition in the amygdala also rescues deficits in 
Nf1+/− mice
Using constitutive gene deletion, one cannot definitively conclude 
that the social learning deficits are being rescued by selective Pak1 
inhibition within the amygdala. Therefore, in a subsequent experi-
ment, we tested the effects of bilaterally injecting previously known 
effective doses of a Pak1 inhibitor, IPA3 (or its inactive enantiomer 
PIR3.5 as control), into the BLA of Nf1+/− mice 30 min before assess-
ment in the social familiarity test on days 1 and 2. Preinjection of 
IPA3 (100 µM, 100 nl), but not PIR3.5, into the BLA increased prefer-
ence for the novel mouse in Nf1+/− mice during the long-term social 
memory test. Notably, IPA3 injection into the BLA also increased 
social preference in WT mice during the long-term social memory 
test to levels above baseline, further supporting a role of the BLA and 
Pak1 activity in social learning (n = 6, 6, 6, 6; side preference × Nf1+/− 
interaction F1,18 = 5.2, P = 0.036, and side preference × Pak1 inhibitor 
interaction F1,18 = 8.8, P = 0.008; Fig. 5a–c). Additionally, we also con-
firmed that there were reduced numbers of Adam22-immunoreactive 
cells in the BLA of Nf1+/− mice, an effect that was rescued in Nf1+/− 
mice pretreated with IPA3 in the BLA (n = 3, 3, 3, 3; Nf1+/− effect  
F1,12 = 9.7, P = 0.014, and Pak1 inhibitor effect F1,12 = 10.0, P = 0.013; 
Fig. 5d,e). To validate that the doses of IPA3 (and not those of the

we tested the effects of preinjecting these drugs (100 µM, 100 nl) on 
the increases in the number of pErk-immunoreactive cells after stimu-
lation with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), a known activator of Pak1 
activity in neurons24,25. Injections of DMSO induced the increases 
in pErk expression in the amygdala, whereas preinjection with IPA3, 
but not PIR3.5, was able to block these effects (n = 5, 3, 4; F2,11 = 22.6,  
P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 2a,d,e). Acute activation of Pak1 with 
injections of DMSO into the BLA of WT mice also caused a reduction 
in the number of Adam22-immunoreactive cells, and IPA3 (but not 
PIR3.5) preinjections blocked those reductions as well (n = 5, 3, 4; 
F2,11 = 6.2, P = 0.020; Supplementary Fig. 2b,d,e).

DISCUSSION
In summary, our findings demonstrate that Nf1+/− mice exhibit a 
selective deficit in social learning, and the mechanisms underlying 
these social learning deficits appear to be disruption in the regulation 
of classical Mapk pathways in the amygdala. We also determined that 
Nf1+/− mice show disruptions of synaptic plasticity (LTP), GABA-
mediated inhibition and glutamate excitation of neurons and altered 
expression of the important synaptic proteins Adam22, Cap1 and 
Hsp70 within the amygdala. ADAM22 is a synaptic protein that is 
thought to be critical for regulating the strength of glutamate neu-
rotransmission and LTP and has been shown to specifically anchor 
AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic terminals in the hippocam-
pus26–28.  Therefore,  although  the  role  of  ADAM22  in  anchoring 
AMPA receptors in the amygdala specifically has not been demon-
strated directly, significant decreases in Adam22 in Nf1+/− mice in 
the amygdala could be predicted to cause a similar failure to anchor 
AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane and sustain LTP, as 
demonstrated in Nf1+/− mice (a hypothetical illustration is shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 1b). Similarly, HSP70 is thought to be critical 
for anchoring the GABA synthetic mechanisms to the presynaptic 
terminals29, and increases in the expression levels of HSP70 could lead 
to increases in presynaptic GABA release specifically and an increased 
frequency of sIPSCs, as we demonstrated here. These increases in 
GABA release may also compensate for some of the glutamate neu-
rotransmission disequilibrium and could be a potential explanation 
for Nf1+/− mice not developing the severe seizures that are seen in 
Adam22−/− mice30. CAP1 is a protein that has an important role in the 
regulation of actin polymerization and synaptic remodeling, processes 
that are critical for long-term memory31.

The social deficits and all of the aforementioned amygdala dis-
ruptions  in  Nf1+/−  mice  were  rescued  by  deletion  of  Pak1  gene. 
Pharmacological blockade of Pak1 function within the amygdala also 
rescued the social deficits seen in Nf1+/− mice. These results suggest 
that Pak1 inhibition, consistent with the recently reported reductions 
in neurofibroma tumors in children with NF1 (ref. 32), may be a ther-
apeutic target of interest for the treatment of NF1-related social and 
learning symptoms that pose a major burden to affected children1,32. 
Deletion of Pak1 gene, which rescued the behavioral deficits seen in 
Nf1+/− mice, also restored the changes in synaptic protein expression 
and, as predicted by our hypotheses, rescued the network disrup-
tions in the amygdala and normalized amygdala LTP. The precise 
mechanisms involved in these gene expression changes induced by 
Nf1 haploinsufficiency and their rescue by Pak1 deletion have yet to 
be determined. However, there is supportive evidence that inhibiting 
Pak1 levels will reduce CAP1 levels in the CNS33, and the genes for 
Pak1, Erk1 and Lgl-4 (the endogenous CNS ligand for Adam22) are 
all located on mouse chromosome 7. Moreover, it has been shown that 
single injection of a Pak1 inhibitor completely rescues seizures and 

a r t I C l e S

behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperactivity and repetitive move-
ments, in fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1−/−) mice34. Because of 
increases in the co-occurrence of NF1 and ASDs35,36, these findings 
may also have important implications regarding the molecular targets 
for the remediation of social deficits in some forms of ASD. Indeed, a 
recent deep-brain stimulation report showed that stimulating the BLA 
region directly in a severely autistic child was effective in improving 
core symptoms of the ASD in the emotional, social and even cognitive 
domains over a follow-up period of 24 months37. In conclusion, we 
have demonstrated selective deficits in social learning and under-
lying disruptions in the amygdala network caused by a single-gene 
(Nf1) mutation. We have also provided a potential new therapeutic 
approach toward ameliorating these disabling behavioral symptoms 
in patients with NF1 and some forms of ASD.

Animals. Most experiments were conducted using adult male mice, except for 
the cellular assay and western blotting experiment, which was done using mice at 
postnatal day (P) 2–3, and the electrophysiology experiments, which were done 
in 2- to 3-month-old mice. The mouse strains tested were bred on a C57BL/6J 
background and included WT, Nf1+/−, Nf1+/− Pak1−/− and Pak1−/−. The Nf1+/− 
mice were obtained from T. Jacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(Cambridge, MA), and Pak1−/− mice were obtained from J. Chernoff (Fox Chase 
Cancer Center). To generate the Nf1+/− Pak1−/− mice, Pak1−/− mice were inter-
crossed with the Nf1+/− strain. All mice were singly housed, given food and water 
ad libitum and maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (7 a.m./7 p.m.) at 72 °F.  
Animal care procedures were conducted in accordance with the US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
(NIH publication number 80-23) revised 1996. All procedures were approved by 
the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (protocol number 10326).

Behavioral testing. The behavioral testing reported in Figure 1a–d and g–j was 
done in the same cohort of mice, which were tested in the social behavior test 
on day 1, the elevated plus maze (Fig. 1g) on day 2, the olfactory test on day 3  
and the behavioral despair test on day 4. The behavioral testing reported in  
Figure 1e,f was in done in the same cohort of mice, which were tested in the 
novel object recognition test on day 1 and the passive avoidance test on day 2. 
The behavioral testing reported in Figure 2b–h was done in the same cohort of 
mice, which were tested in the social behavior test on day 1, the elevated plus 
maze (Fig. 1g) on day 2, the olfactory test on day 3 and the behavioral despair test 
on day 4. The social behavior tests reported in Figure 4 were done in a separate 
cohort of mice in a crossover design with 5 d between crossover. All behavioral 
tests were videotaped and independently scored at a later time by two individuals 
who were unaware of the animals’ genotype. After each test, the apparatus were 
cleaned with 90% ethanol and dried.

Social behavior tests. The social interaction test was conducted as previously 
described17,18. Four 10-min sessions were conducted, including (i) day 1: acclima-
tion (two empty cylindrical cages); (ii) day 1: 5 min after acclimation, assessing 
preference for social interaction (novel mouse (mouse 1) and an empty cage); 
(iii) day 1: 5 min after initial exposure to mouse 1, a short-term social learning 
test was done with mouse 1 (the now familiar mouse) and mouse 2 (a novel 
mouse); and (iv) long-term social learning 24 h later (familiar mouse (mouse 2) 
and a novel mouse (mouse 3)). After the short-term social learning session, the 
novel mouse was removed from the apparatus, and the test mouse was allowed 
to interact with the familiar mouse for an additional 45 min. The stimulus mice 
used for the social behavior tests were age-matched, adult male C57BL/6J mice 
that had no previous contact with the test mice.

novel object recognition test. The novel object recognition test was used to 
measure short-term memory retention. The apparatus consisted of an opaque 
Plexiglas chamber of (50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm). Two objects with similar textures, 
colors and sizes (two cylinders) were placed in opposite corners of the cham-
ber. Between trials, the objects and the box were cleaned with 70% ethanol. The 
habituation session consisted of placing a mouse in the chamber for 10 min, and 
at the end of each session, the mouse was returned to the home cage. Two hours 
later, the mouse was placed in the chamber with a similar cylinder in each corner, 
and the time exploring the two objects (measured as the mouse’s nose within  
1 inch of the object) was assessed for 10 min. 30 min later, the mouse was placed 
in the chamber with the now-familiar cylinder and an unfamiliar cube in each 
corner. The time exploring the two dissimilar objects (again measured as the 
mouse’s nose within 1 inch of the object) was assessed for 10 min.

Passive avoidance memory test. This passive avoidance task is a one-trial fear-
motivated avoidance task in which the mouse learns to refrain from stepping from 
a lighted chamber through a door to an apparently safer enclosed dark chamber 
where the mouse previously received a shock. The training chambers consist of 
one compartment (20 cm × 40 cm × 30 cm height) that is lighted by an overhead 
stimulus light (40 W bulb) and a second compartment (20 cm × 20 cm × 30 cm 
height) that is black and enclosed so as to remain dark. An automatic guillotine 
door separates the two compartments.

On habituation day, the mouse is placed in a lighted compartment facing away 
from the dark compartment, allowed to explore for 30 s and then the door to 
the dark chamber is raised. When the mouse enters the dark compartment, the 
guillotine door is closed. 5 min later, the mouse is removed and returned to  
the home cage. On the training day, the test is repeated, except that after entering 
the dark chamber, the door is closed and the mouse receives a foot shock (0.5 mA, 
2-s duration) through a grid. 30 s after the foot shock, the mouse is returned to 
the home cage. On testing day, the test is repeated, and the latency to enter the 
dark chamber with front two paws is determined.

elevated  plus  maze.  The  elevated  plus  maze  was  conducted  as  described  
previously19, where mice were allowed to freely explore the entire apparatus  
for  5  min.  This  procedure  was  again  performed  24  h  later  as  a  measure  of  
avoidance learning. An arm entry was defined as having all four paws into the 
arm of the elevated plus maze.

The Porsolt forced swim test. The forced swim test was used to measure aspects 
of behavioral despair19,39. The forced swim apparatus consisted of a cylindrical 
chamber constructed of clear Plexiglas with a diameter of 8.5 inches and height 
of 10 inches. For each trial, the chamber was filled with 25 ± 1 °C water. The test 
mouse was then gently placed into the cylinder for 15 min. Twenty-four hours 
later, the mice were re-exposed to the same conditions for an additional 6-min 
trial. Immobility was considered as the cessation of limb movements except for 
minor involuntary hindlimb movements.

olfactory habituation test. The mice were placed in a clean cage and were 
assessed for time spent sniffing cotton-tipped swabs suspended from the cage 
lid. The cotton swabs were dipped in water or almond extract (1:100 dilution) or 
were wiped in a zigzag pattern across the bottom surface of a cage that contained 
an unfamiliar mouse (a singly housed C57BL/6J male mouse). The sequences of 
three identical swabs were assayed for each odor as follows: water, water, water, 
almond, almond, almond, unfamiliar cage, unfamiliar cage, unfamiliar cage. Each 
swab was presented for 2 min for a total session lasting 18 min per mouse.

Isolation and culture of neuronal cells from mouse strains. Neurons were 
obtained from the frontal cortical and amygdala regions of P2–P3 mice that 
were aseptically dissected and cultured from each genotype (WT, Nf1+/−, Nf1+/− 
Pak1−/− and Pak1−/−). After dissection of each brain region, neuronal cells were 
isolated by dissociation both enzymatically and mechanically (by trituration 
through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette) in a Papain solution (12 units/ml; 
Worthington) as described previously19. For this experiment, the neuronal cul-
tures were assigned to one of two experimental conditions: (i) at basal levels or 
(ii) after the application of recombinant mouse SCF (PreproTech) at 10 ng/ml. 
SCF was applied to the neuronal cultures for 2 min. The cells were then washed 
with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer, as described below.

Immunoblotting erk and perk in mouse cortical and amygdala neurons. 
Whole-cell protein extracts were obtained from the frontal cortical and amygdala 
regions of P2–P3 mice and placed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM  
NaCl,  2  mM  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA),  pH  8.0,  1%  Triton  
X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 
10% glycerol and protease inhibitors). The samples were sonicated, and cellular 
debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein con-
centrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo 
Scientific). Equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 10% sodium 
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, transferred 
to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, 
UK) and detected by western blotting using the ECL Plus system (Amersham 
Biosciences). The antibodies used were to pErk1/2 (4370, 1:1,000 dilution, Cell 
Signaling Technology), Erk1/2 (4695, 1:1,000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) 
and GAPDH (MAB374, 1:1,000 dilution, Millipore). Cell Signaling reports that 
the Erk1/2 monoclonal antibody p44/42 MAP kinase (137F5) rabbit monoclonal 
antibody detects endogenous levels of total p44/42 MAP kinase (Erk1/Erk2) pro-
tein. The antibody does not crossreact with JNK/SAPK or p38 MAP kinase, and 
the monoclonal antibody to pErk1/2 is produced by immunizing rabbits with a 
synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to residues surrounding Thr202 and 
Tyr204 of human p44 MAP kinase and binds to endogenous levels of p44 and p42

of Erk1 (Thr185 and Tyr187 of Erk2) and singly phosphorylated at Thr202. This 
antibody does not crossreact with the corresponding phosphorylated residues 
of either JNK/SAPK or p38 MAP kinases. All mice were delivered to R.K., who 
was unaware of the animals’ genotype.

Immunostaining of perk in cells from the amygdala of mice exposed to a novel 
mouse. WT and Nf1+/− mice were habituated to the social learning apparatus 
with two empty cages and were placed in a social learning apparatus with a novel 
mouse in one cage 24 h later. Mice were then placed in the home cage for 80 min, 
anesthetized with isoflurane and then perfused transcardially with 250 ml 0.1 M 
PBS, followed by 250 ml of 0.1 M PB containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% 
sucrose and processed for immunohistochemistry to yield four alternative sets 
of serial coronal sections (30 µm). A standard immunohistochemical procedure 
was then performed as described in detail previously40 using a monoclonal rabbit 
pErk1/2 antibody (1:200 dilution, 4370, Cell Signaling).

Protein expression analysis. Tissue slices were homogenized in 50 mM ammo-
nium bicarbonate, and whole-cell protein extracts were obtained from brain 
slices in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 
SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na2CO3, 160 mM NaF and complete 
protease inhibitor) with a ProteoSpin total protein detergent clean up micro kit 
(Norgen, Canada). The BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used 
to determine protein concentrations of the lysates (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Protein 
samples were reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT), and alkylation was achieved 
by adding iodoacetic acid (IAA). The protein samples then subjected to tryptic 
digestion at 37 °C overnight and quenched through the addition of neat formic 
acid. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses 
of the tryptic digests were performed using a Dionex 3000 Ultimate nano-LC 
system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced to an LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Prior to separation, a 2-µl aliq-
uot of trypsin digestion (1.5 µg protein equivalent) was loaded on a PepMap300 
C18 cartridge (5 µm, 300 Å; Dionex) and eluted through the analytical column  
(150  mm  ×  100  µm  inner  diameter,  200-Å  pores)  packed  with  C18  magic 
(Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Peptides originating from protein tryp-
tic digests were separated using a reversed-phase gradient from 3–55% B, 99.9% 
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic at a 500 nl/min flow rate and passed through an 
ADVANCE ionization source (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Switching 
between MS scan and collision-induced dissociation MS (CID-MS), eluted LC 
products undergo an initial full-spectrum MS scan from m/z 300 to m/z 2,000 in 
the Orbitrap at 15,000 mass resolutions. Subsequently CID-MS (at 35% normal-
ized collision energy) was performed. The total cycle (six scans) is continuously 
repeated for the entire LC-MS run under data-dependent conditions. Mascot 
version 2.1.3 was used for all search results against the Swiss-Prot database for 
house mouse, and the quantitative analysis of proteins was carried out using the 
ProteinQuant Suit developed at Indiana University. The combined master files 
were then incorporated with their corresponding mzXML files and were submit-
ted to ProteinQuant as described previously41. Pathway analyses were then con-
ducted on proteins that showed significant differences between WT and Nf1+/− 
and that were restored in the Nf1+/− Pak1−/− genotype using INGENUITY sys-
tems software (Redwood City, CA). Protein expression data were further analyzed 
using one-way and two-way ANOVA. All mouse tissue was given to the proteom-
ics core collaborators, who were unaware of the animals’ genotype.

electrophysiology. The electrophysiological recordings were performed in 2- to 
3-month-old mice as described previously42. Briefly, after decapitation, the brains 
were rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid 
(ACSF) (130 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM 
CaCl2, 30 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM glucose), and coronal slices (350 µM) were 
prepared containing the BLA. After an initial incubation of at least 30 min at 30 °C  
in oxygenated ACSF, slices were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on 
the stage of a Nikon E600FN Eclipse (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) micro-
scope and perfused with ACSF (2–3 ml per minute) heated to 30 °C. Whole-cell 
patch-clamp recordings were obtained using standard techniques. Borosilicate 
glass electrodes (WPI, Sarasota, FL) (resistance 3–6 MΩ) were prepared with a 
potassium gluconate–based recording solution (130 mM K-gluconate, 3 mM 
KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 2 mM K-ATP, 0.2 mM NaGTP and 

10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)) and were 
maintained at a holding potential of −60 mV. BLA pyramidal neurons were identi-
fied according to their characteristic size and shape43. At the start of each experi-
ment, except for the LTP experiments, a series of current clamp protocols was 
performed to further validate the identity of the BLA projection neurons. Drugs 
were added directly into the ACSF at the required concentration. The sIPSCs and 
mIPSCs (in the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX)) were recorded at a holding 
potential of −55 mV in the presence of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 
20 µM) and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 1 µM).  
The sEPSCs and mEPSCs (in 1 µM TTX) were acquired at a holding potential  
of −60 mV in the presence of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methochloride 
(10 µM) and the GABAB antagonist 3-[[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]amino] 
propyl] diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP52432, 1 µM). The spontaneous 
and miniature currents were captured continuously for 1 min and detected and 
analyzed afterwards using the MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA).

EPSPs  onto  BLA  projection  neurons  were  evoked  in  a  current  clamp  as 
described previously23. The GABAB antagonist CGP52432 (1 µM) was added 
to the ACSF, and the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin (50 µM) was included in 
the recording solution. The holding potential was adjusted to −70 mV, except 
during TBS, when the potential was adjusted to −55 mV to facilitate spike firing.  
A 10-min baseline period was recorded in each experiment, and recordings were 
continued for at least 60 min after LTP induction. The TBS was 40 ms in duration, 
with 100 bursts delivered at 5 Hz for 5 s (100 pulses total). Evoked postsynaptic 
potentials were analyzed using pClamp 10.3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). 
All chemicals, except CPP and CGP52432 (Tocris Biosciences, Ellisville, MO), 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All mice were brought to 
A.I.M., who was unaware of the animals’ genotype.

Immunohistochemistry for Adam22, cap1 and Hsp70 in the BlA. Mice were 
anesthetized with halothane then perfused transcardially with 250 ml 0.1 M  
PBS, followed by 250 ml of 0.1 M PB containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% 
sucrose  and  processed  for  standard  immunohistochemistry  as  described  in 
detail previously40. Here we used the following antibodies on separate serial sec-
tions: affinity purified rabbit anti-Adam22 polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, 
ab56122, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-Cap1 polyclonal antibody (1:200 
dilution, sc134637, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA) and affinity puri-
fied rabbit anti-Hsp70 polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution, NBP1-00880, Novus  
Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Abcam reports the following: the Adam22 immuno-
gen was a synthetic peptide based on the metalloproteinase domain of human 
ADAM22, and the Adam22 antibody is reactive with mouse Adam22 protein 
at the predicted band in western blots. Santa Cruz reports that the Cap1 rabbit 
polyclonal antibody was raised against amino acids 14–74 mapping near the N 
terminus of CAP1 of human origin and is reactive with mouse Cap1 protein at 
the predicted band in western blots. Novus Biologicals reports that the Cap1 
antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the residues 
surrounding Phe245 of human HSP70 and is reactive with mouse Hsp70 protein 
at the predicted band in western blots.

Photography and cell counts. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Leica 
brightfield microscope using N plan 5×, 10×, 20× and 40× objective lenses (model 
DMLB, Leica Microsystems), a SPOT digital camera (RT color, Diagnostics 
Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) and SPOT 4.7.1.32 for Windows dig-
ital imaging software. Photographic plates were prepared in CorelDraw X5 for 
Windows (Eden Prairie, MN). Immunoreactive cells in the BLA were counted on 
a 400× magnification photomicrograph and then verified at 400× using a Leica 
DMLB binocular microscope (Leica Microsystems) by an investigator (P.L.J.) 
who was blind to the experimental treatment of each animal.

Site-directed  injections  of  a  Pak1  inhibitor  into  the  BlA  of  Nf1  mice. 
Stereotaxic cannula placement. Prior to and during surgery, mice were anes-
thetized with a nose cone connected to an isoflurane system (MGX Research 
Machine, Vetamic) and placed in an ultraprecise stereotaxic apparatus for rodents 
(900 series Ultraprecise Kopf Instruments). Bilateral injection cannulae (26 gauge; 
Plastics One) were implanted into the BLA (anteroposterior (AP): −1.5, medi-
olateral (ML): ±3.35, dorsoventral (DV): −4.55, and the incisor bar was set at 
−3.0 mm to keep the lambda and bregma suture at the same DV) according to 
a standard stereotaxic atlas of the mouse brain38. The cannulae were secured to

and Loctite adhesive. After completion of surgery, a dummy cannula that went 
the length of the guide was screwed in place. All mice then received buprenex 
at 1 mg per kg body weight subcutaneously and were placed on a warming pad 
until they had fully recovered.

Intracranial injection procedures. At 30 min before the novel mouse exposure 
and the long-term social memory testing the next day, WT and Nf1+/− mice 
received microinjections with an injector (33 gauge; Plastic Products) that fit into, 
and extended 0.5 mm beyond, the guide cannula. A 10-µl Hamilton syringe was 
placed on an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, model PHD 
2000) and connected to the injection cannula using polyethylene (PE 50) tub-
ing. The pump delivered 100 nl of either the Pak1 inhibitor IPA3 (3622, Tocris 
Biosciences; n = 6) or the inactive enantiomer PIR3.5 (4212, Tocris Biosciences; 
n = 6) dissolved in DMSO into the BLA per site over 30 s. The injection can-
nula remained in place for an additional minute to ensure complete delivery of 
the solution, and proper flow was confirmed in the cannulae after removal. All 
injection sites were verified using a 400×-magnification Leica DMLB brightfield 
microscope.

Statistical analyses of data. For the behavior tests shown in Figure 1 with west-
ern blotting and immunohistochemistry with WT and Nf1+/− mice, data were 
analyzed using one-way ANOVA with genotype as the main factor and, when 
applicable, a side preference or time as a repeated measure. For the behavior 
tests shown in Figure 2 with Nf1+/−, Nf1+/− Pak1−/− and Pak1−/− mice, data were 
analyzed using one-way ANOVA with genotype as the main factor and, when 
applicable, a side preference or time as a repeated measure. For the electrophysi-
ology experiments shown in Figure 3, the proteomics and immunohistochem-
istry analyses in Table 1 and Figure 4 and the behavior tests in Figure 5 with 
WT, Nf1+/−, Nf1+/− Pak1−/− and Pak1−/− mice, data were analyzed using two-way 
ANOVA with Nf1+/− and Pak1−/− as the main factors or genotype and drug treat-
ment as the main factors and, when applicable, a side preference or time as a 
repeated measure. Significant effects were further analyzed using post-hoc Fisher’s 
protected least significant difference (FLSD) tests for between-subjects effects 

of multiple groups or a two-way paired or independent t test (as appropriate) 
for two-group comparisons. A Dunnett’s post-hoc test was used to compare the 
within-subject over-time effects shown in Figure 3. A Levene’s test was conducted 
before analyses to assess for equality of variance. To protect against type 1 errors, 
the n numbers per group were considered acceptable if they were significant  
(P < 0.05) in the previously mentioned analyses. In cases where there was a trend 
toward significance (P > 0.05–0.060), power analyses were done to determine if 
the n numbers per group were sufficiently powered and to protect against type 
2 errors. An outlier was detected for one animal in the behavioral assessments 
shown in Figure 1c and also in Figure 5a with a Grubb’s test, and data from this 
animal were therefore excluded from analyses. There were no missing data for cell 
assays, western blots, proteomics analyses or electrophysiology. For proteomics 
analyses, using Pathway analyses in INGENUITY software, there were no miss-
ing data points. However in a subsequent secondary analyses using one-way 
ANOVA, there was one missing data point in the Cap1 WT group because of an 
outlier that was >2 s.d. from the mean (Fig. 4a). For immunohistochemistry, one 
data point was missing in the Cap1 WT group (Fig. 4d) and the Hsp70 Nf1+/− 
group (Fig. 4e) because there was no representative coronal slice containing the 
amygdala at that level of bregma, and another data point in the Cap1 WT group 
was an outlier.
