Abstract The RASopathy neurofibromatosis 1 is an autoso-
mal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome that represents a
major risk for the development of malignancies, particularly
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).
MPNSTs are unique sarcomas that originate from the periph-
eral nerve and represent the only primary cancer of the periph-
eral nervous system. To date, surgery is the only treatment
modality proven to have survival benefit for MPNSTs and
even when maximal surgery is feasible, these tumors are rare-
ly curable, despite the use of chemotherapy and radiation. In
this review, we discuss the current state-of-the-art treatments
for MPNSTs, latest therapeutic developments, and critical as-
pects of the underlying molecular and pathophysiology that
appear promising for therapeutic developments in the future.
In particular, we discuss the specific elements of cancer in the
peripheral nerve and how that may impel development of
unique therapies for this form of sarcoma.

Introduction to Neurofibromatosis 1

The RASopathy neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal
dominant hereditary cancer syndrome that affects ~1 in 3000
individuals [1]. The diagnosis of NF1 is based on National
Institutes of Health clinical consensus criteria [2, 3], with the
main clinical features including multiple café-au-lait macules,
axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas, pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumors, multiple forms of cognitive dys-
function, and a higher risk of cancers such as pheochromocy-
toma and breast cancer in young women. NF1 is caused by
various DNA alterations, including point mutations, deletions,
insertions, microdeletions, and splicing mutations of the NF1
tumor suppressor gene at 17q11.2, which encodes the GTPase
activating protein neurofibromin that catalyzes the inactiva-
tion of Ras by accelerating guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis
to guanosine diphosphate [4, 5]. In affected individuals, trun-
cation or loss of neurofibromin results in activated Ras with
subsequent activation of the Raf–mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
cascade. The Ras hyperactivation supports the frequent devel-
opment of multiple benign tumors, especially neurofibromas,
and, less frequently, cancers.

NF1 is a highly variable disease and considerable differ-
ences in clinical symptoms are noted within the same family
[1]. Notably, phenotype–genotype correlation studies have
suggested that the type of mutation in the NF1 gene does
not solely account for the observed phenotype, with the ex-
ception of patients carrying chromosomal deletions
(microdeletions) [6]. Although only 5% to 10% of patients
with NF1 harbor these microdeletions, affected individuals
account for an overproportional morbidity and mortality be-
cause the loss of the entire NF1 locus and large parts of adja-
cent sequences predisposes patients to a more severe clinical
phenotype characterized by a higher burden of cutaneous

neurofibromas, earlier onset of benign neurofibromas, and a
higher incidence of malignancies, particularly malignant pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [7, 8]. Hence, a high
index of suspicion and close medical surveillance program is
critical to detect a large range of possible complications, in-
cluding MPNST, even though they occur in only a relatively
small percentage of all patients with NF1 [9].

Plexiform Neurofibromas: Nerve Tumor Precursor
for MPNST

A hallmark of NF1 is the presence of plexiform neurofibromas
(pNFs) and they are present in 50% of individuals with NF1
[10]. pNFs are tumors that arise in the peripheral nerve and
involve multiple nerve fascicles. They typically grow along a
nerve and its branches and there are frequently collisions of
multiple nerve tumors into large masses in plexi such as the
brachial or lumbosacral plexi (Fig. 1). Thus, the involvement
of multiple fascicles (and indeed whole plexi) makes complete
surgical resections without neurologic deficit impossible.
Even in lesions whose location and size would allow mean-
ingful surgical debulking, a complete resection is not possible
without transection of the nerve. As a result, patients with
pNFs are often recommended to undergo surveillance alone
and manifestations (pain, neurologic deficits) are managed ex-
pectantly. Ultimately, these tumors can grow over time to cause
substantial morbidity. Equally importantly, these benign tu-
mors act as precursor lesions and can transform into
MPNSTs, with high body tumor burden being a strong risk
factor for MPNST development [11]. This is why some experts
recommend targeted and whole-body magnetic resonance

imaging to screen for subclinical pNFs early in life; however,
such screening method has not been incorporated into the NF1
guidelines yet as there are no prospective data about the opti-
mal screening protocol or age for surveillance, and no proven
interventions to prevent malignant transformation [12].

In people with known pNF, imaging characteristics that
may suggest impending malignant transformation include
nodular-appearing lesions with an apparent diffusion coeffi-
cient value <1 on magnetic resonance imaging; lesions larger
than ≥ 3 cm in diameter; signal heterogeneity; ill-defined mar-
gins; presence of edema; or lesions that show avid uptake of
fluorodeoxyglucose on positron emission tomography (Fig. 2)
[13–15]. When biopsied, these lesions are often classified as
atypical neurofibromas (aNFs), a premalignant lesion that ex-
hibits some features of low-grade MPNST, such as higher
mitotic activity or neoangiogenesis, and accumulation of mo-
lecular abnormalities [16].

Genetic Evolution of MPNSTs

About 8% to 13% of pNFs across all NF1 patients undergo
cancerous transformation into MPNSTs [7, 17], in contrast to
16% to 26% in patients with microdeletions [8]. While > 80%
of MPNSTs evolve from pre-existing pNFs, a small propor-
tion can arise de novo. The last few years have provided a
wealth of new knowledge on the biology and pathophysiology
of NF1-associated MPNST that unveiled important mecha-
nisms in the transition of pNF to MPNST. Similar to other
cancer predisposition syndromes, accumulating evidence sug-
gests that for carcinogenesis loss of NF1 alone is not sufficient
but requires a multistep process in which accumulated genetic
and epigenetic alternations affect the regulation of multiple
cellular processes, including growth factor signaling, metabo-
lism, and apoptosis. Although the detailed mechanisms of the
malignant transformation remain unknown, biallelic-
inactivating mutations must occur in NF1 in Schwann cells
as the initial tumor-forming event, leading to either complete
loss of function or substantial reduction of functional
neurofibromin and subsequent hyperactivation of Ras and
multiple downstream Ras effector pathways, including activa-
tion of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase B, mam-
malian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Raf, MEK and ERK
(Fig. 3) [18]. The inactivating NF1 mutations in Schwann cell
alleles result in benign tumor formation, and these tumors
have increased cell proliferation and hyperplasia, as seen in
pNFs and aNFs, but no features of malignancy. Deletion of
cell-cycle regulator CDKN2A/B is the next step in the pro-
gression toward cancer and this is present in the majority of
aNFs but absent in pNFs [19]. Lastly, for the formation of a
malignant cancer (MPNST) additional critical genetic and epi-
genetic events must appear. Those alterations include loss-of-
function mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53, which

among its many functions activates various growth factors and
blocks the activation of HIF-1α leading to subsequent overex-
pression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors,
as well as loss-of-function of the histone methyltransferase
polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), including its core com-
ponents EED or SUZ12 [19].

In particular, SUZ12 is also lost in patients with
microdeletions, which, as stated earlier, are associated with an
increased risk for MPNST and poor survival. The loss of PRC2
components results in complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27
of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and transcriptional activation of mul-
tiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators, as well as
their pathways, thereby potentiating the effects of NF1 mutations
by amplifying Ras-driven transcription [20]. Those alterations in
the context of TP53 loss provide a mitogenic advantage and
promote malignant tumor formation by upregulating various pro-
liferative stimuli, such as epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), neuregulin-1 co-receptor erbB2, c-Kit, platelet-derived
growth factor-α, and c-Met [21].

Current Standard of Treatment and Outcomes
in NF1-Associated MPNST

MPNSTs are the most common malignancy and the leading
cause of death in individuals with NF1, particularly for those
younger than 40 years of age [22]. It is the only primary cancer
of the peripheral nervous system; however, peripheral nerves can
also be involved in other cancers by compression or infiltration
from metastasis and lymphomas. Histologically, MPNSTs are
comprised of spindle cells reminiscent of Schwann cells that
can be distinguished in high-grade MPNST and low-grade
MPNST based on cellularity, mitotic figures, and presence of
necrosis [23]. As MPNSTs often arise within peripheral nerves,

considerable tissue heterogeneity exists which often complicates
the diagnostic process.

MPNSTs are staged and treated as malignant soft tissue
sarcomas. These tumors require a multidisciplinary team of
surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists; radiologists;
and pathologists. Tumor grade, location, extent of surgical
resection, and presence or absence of metastases are the key
factors influencing therapeutic decision-making. The only
known definitive curative treatment for MPNSTs is complete
surgical resection with wide negative margins, which may not
be feasible in a number of patients, owing to variables such as
tumor size, location, and metastases [17, 22]. In patients with
high-grade lesions > 5 cm in size or where the attainment of
wide excision margins by surgery alone is difficult, preopera-
tive radiation therapy (RT) is often considered to improve
local control, although its neoadjuvant role is not defined
and a clear survival improvement has not been demonstrated
[24–26]. RT is standard in non-NF1-associated MPNSTs, but
controversial in the setting of NF1 because there is no proven
survival advantage and ongoing concerns about an increased
risk for malignant conversion of neighboring benign tumors
after exposure to RT [26, 27]. Likewise, the role of chemo-
therapy remains unclear. A number of neurofibromatosis and
sarcoma centers in the US utilize chemotherapy (ifosfamide,
doxorubicin), pre- and/or postoperatively, in their treatment
protocols with disease stabilization for the majority of patients
and partial responses in a small fraction of patients [28].
Regardless, there is little prospective NF1-specific data about
outcomes with this approach and these therapies have high
risks of associated toxicity. Hence, there is currently no con-
sensus about the role of chemotherapy in the setting of newly
diagnosed NF1-associated MPNST. Despite maximal efforts,
MPNST frequently recur [22], and for patients with recurrent,
unresectable, or metastatic disease no treatment standards are
available and enrollment in clinical trials should be

considered. Overall, only 20% of patients with NF1-
associated MPNST survive longer than 5 years, reflecting
the urgent need for new and more effective therapeutics for
this cancer.

Investigational Drugs in Clinical Trials

Although efforts are needed and ongoing to standardize and
optimize existing therapies, we have possibly reached the
limits of what can be accomplished with traditional cytotoxic
agents. Advancements in understanding signaling mecha-
nisms and molecular networks have identified new nodes of
vulnerabilities. However, the rarity of these tumors and their
heterogeneity has limited the number of trials available.

Owing to the lack of clinically effective anti-Ras drugs, trans-
lational research has focused on critical downstream effectors of
Ras. In MPNSTs, loss of NF1 has been shown to activate down-
stream effectors of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway,
including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mTOR signaling path-
ways [29]. RTKs comprise a family of surface receptors that,
under physiologic conditions, are intermittently activated by li-
gand binding to regulate changes in cell proliferation and differ-
entiation [30]. However, in oncologic processes such as
MPNSTs, these kinases are constitutively activated and support

tumor propagation, including cell proliferation, survival, and
therapeutic resistance [30].

A number of RTKs are closely linked to the tumorigenesis
of MPNST, such as EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor re-
ceptor (PDGFR)-α and PDGFR-β, vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-Kit, and c-Met [29,
31–33]. Multiple studies have implicated EGFR as a key on-
cogenic target in MPNST that is overexpressed in more than
two-thirds of patients and associated with high-grade, p53
positivity and invasiveness [21, 29, 34–38]. Despite a sound
rationale and the fact that MPNST derived from patients and
NF1+/–/TP53+/– mice can be stimulated by epidermal growth
factor and inhibited by EGFR inhibitors [36–38], a phase II
trial with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, the first targeted agent
used in a NF1-associated MPNST, largely failed [39]. Other
inhibitors have targeted PDGFR, which also shows an in-
creased expression of both proteins in MPNSTs and carries
prognostic relevance [29, 40, 41]. In particular, the function of
PDGFR-α is associated with mitogenic signaling through the
Ras/MAPK pathway and promotes angiogenesis, tumor pro-
liferation, and invasion [32, 42, 43]. Preclinical studies re-
vealed that inhibition of PDGFR effectively suppressed
MPNST cell invasion and cell growth [32, 44]. However, the
monotherapeutic use of multikinase inhibitors with anti-
PDGFR activity, such as imatinib mesylate, which blocks
PDGFR, VEGFR, and c-Kit [45], the dual VEGFR/PDGFR
inhibitor sorafenib [46], and dasatinib, which targets PDGFR

302

and c-Kit in addition to BCR-ABL and the Src family [47] did
not show a meaningful treatment response in phase II trials
when tested in patients with refractory MPNSTs.

The failure of RTK pathway inhibitors following the
strong molecular evidence for RTK pathway targeting has
been disappointing, especially when considering the treat-
ment successes in other malignancies. There are several
potential explanations for these treatment failures, most
important are perhaps the aggressive nature and fast pro-
gression of advanced, metastatic MPNSTs; the lack of suf-
ficient Ras suppression and development of intrinsic resis-
tance with both parallel signaling pathways and bypass
feedback loops. Importantly, several oncogenic targets
may also play a critical role for healthy nerve development
and repair, including multiple growth factors and MAPKs
such as Erk and c-Jun N-terminal kinase [48]. However, to
date there has been little investigation about the interaction
between normal nerve signaling and propagation of cancer
in the peripheral nerve.

Recognizing those limitations, newer trials have focused
on combination treatments to increase efficacy and delay the
development of resistance. For example, a phase II trial with
bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the VEGF-α
ligand, plus RAD001, a first-generation mTOR inhibitor
(SARC016), in recurrent MPNST has recently completed
and data are expected this year.

One of the most promising non-RTK inhibitors currently un-
dergoing clinical investigations is heat shock protein (Hsp)90
inhibitor ganetespib. Hsp90 stabilizes certain proteins and re-
duces oxidative stress to favor cancer cell survival, and treatment
with Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib in combination with mTOR
inhibitor sirolimus led to dramatic tumor shrinkage in an NF1+/
–/TP53+/– murine model [49]. A combined phase I/II trial in
refractory MPNSTs is currently ongoing (NCT02008877).

Preclinical Drug Development

Although we know that NF1–/– Schwann cells are a key re-
quirement for tumor formation and the ultimate development
of MPNSTs, it is not clear that any specific neuronal or
Schwann cell-specific elements are contributing to tumor
maintenance or growth. Hence, efforts to develop novel ther-
apeutics have been focused on oncogenic pathways. The iden-
tification of new compounds or targets in the treatment of
MPNSTs has mainly been driven by large-scale compound
screening libraries, targeting of nodes in oncogenic pathways
and perhaps in the future may utilize synthetic lethality screen-
ings, that is, the identification of genes for which the loss of
function would be lethal in the presence of hyperactivated Ras
and NF1 loss.

The use of MEK inhibitors provides a very strong rationale
for the treatment of NF1-associated neoplasms based on the

hyperactivation of Raf/MEK/ERK. Thus, it is not surprising
that the highly selective pharmacological MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival
in a NF1 mouse model [NF1(fl/fl);Dhh-Cre] and in NF1
patient-derived MPNST cell xenografts [50]. Although early
clinical trials of MEK inhibitors in patients with NF1 with
pNFs have resulted in very encouraging results [51], MEK
inhibitors have not yet advanced into clinical trial investiga-
tions for MPNSTs. However, work is underway to bring com-
bination therapies with MEK inhibitors to clinical investiga-
tion for NF1-associated MPNST.

Furthermore, current research supports a therapeutic role for
c-Met and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor, which when
overexpressed in MPNSTs induces cell motility, invasion, angio-
genesis, and VEGF expression. Knockdown of Met and the use
of specific c-Met inhibitor XL184 markedly decreased human
MPNST xenograft growth in mice [31]. c-Met inhibitors have
not been clinically investigated in MPNSTs yet; however, they
are in active investigation for pNFs (NCT02101736).

Epigenetic aberrations play a crucial role in tumorigenesis
of a variety of cancers, including MPNSTs. Recent evidence
by De Raedt et al. [20] indicates that loss of PRC2 complex is
a key oncogenic driver in NF1-associated MPNSTs that can
be therapeutically targeted by BRD4 inhibitors. BRD4 is a
BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) family member that
contains 2 bromodomains, which regulate expression of mi-
totic genes required for cell-cycle progression. Preclinical an-
imal experiments showed that single use of BRD4 inhibitors
exerted modest cytostatic effects, while the combination with
a MEK inhibitor resulted in significant tumor regressions,
with tumor shrinkages up to 67% of mice [20]. This observa-
tion was confirmed by a previous study from Patel et al. [52],
who also reported that BRD4 inhibition in MPNSTs pro-
foundly suppressed both growth and tumorigenesis.
Additional exciting preclinical results were seen with inhibi-
tion of Aurora kinase A using selective inhibitor MLN8237,
which stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased
survival of mice with MPNST xenografts [53].

It has been well established that the tumor environment
plays a critical role in the treatment response and can elicit
therapy resistance [54]. In NF1, there is growing evidence that
the recruitment of macrophages and mast cells to the environ-
ment of pNFs and MPNSTs contributes to the disruption of
the nerve axon–Schwann interactions and creates a supportive
stroma to facilitate tumor proliferation and invasion via alter-
ation of immune functions, angiogenesis, and the release of
cytokines and growth factors [55–57]. There are probably a
number of factors that mediate this chemoattraction; however,
the exact factors and mechanisms remain largely unexplored.
One of the best-described factors is c-Kit ligand/stem cell
factor that is secreted by NF1–/– Schwann cells and results in
the migration of c-Kit-expressing mast cells to the tumor
where they ultimately stimulate tumor proliferation [55]. In

MPNST in Neurofibromatosis 1

addition, CXCL12, which is highly expressed in NF1-
deficient MPNSTs, and colony-stimulating factor-1, which is
released by MPNSTs, are 2 other potent macrophage
chemoattractants [55, 57, 58]. Correlating with these findings,
the genetic and pharmacological disruption of c-Kit with
multikinase inhibitors imatinib, pexidartinib, or PLX3397,
the latter of which also blocks the colony-stimulating factor-
1 receptor, prevented immune cell recruitment and delayed
MPNST growth in preclinical NF1 animal models [55, 57,
59]. Unfortunately, these results could not be confirmed in a
phase II clinical trial with imatinib [45], but more targeted
approaches for c-Kit inhibition are in development and these
may have a role in combination with additional agents moving
forward, as done with pexidartinib and sirolimus
(NCT02584647).

Future preclinical directions may also investigate the role of
immunotherapeutics in MPNSTs, which has remained a largely
unexplored field in the NF community. Immune checkpoint in-
hibitors, that is, blocking antibodies of surface receptors
expressed on the host’s T cells and tumor, such as cytotoxic T
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, the programmed death-1 (PD-
1) receptor, and the PD-L1 ligand have recently gained clinical
significance because of their ability to induce a potent antitumor
immune response and tumor remissions, particularly in tumors
with prominent lymphocyte infiltration and mismatch repair de-
ficiency [60]. Newly published data indicate that MPNSTs ex-
hibit a “non-inflamed phenotype” with low PD-1 and PD-L1
expression levels [61]. However, although the expression of
PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells or immune cells is an im-
portant marker to predict response, it is not a definitive marker
[60]. Thus, a combination approach using effector T-cell activa-
tion with other drugs could still be beneficial for patients with
MPNST and does warrant further investigations.

Furthermore, direct intratumoral therapies delivered by im-
planted biomaterials, convection-enhanced delivery, or
replication-competent biological agents such as oncolytic vi-
ruses and bacteria are also becoming more advanced and may
be useful in a subset of patients, with localized, nonresectable,
nonmetastatic MPNSTs. For example, an oncolytic measles vi-
rus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter is currently be-
ing investigated in a phase I trial in MPNSTs (NCT02700230).
Based on reports, measles viruses attach to the cancer cell mem-
brane, kill cancer cells, and cause disease regression [62]. In
addition, it is able to take up iodine and thus may be used to
visualize infected cancer cells [63].

Aside from viruses, anaerobic bacteria have also been used
to treat cancer and are currently in preclinical testing for
MPNSTs, owing to their hypoxic nature. One particular prom-
ising strain is Clostridium novyi, which is a highly motile
spore-forming anaerobe that is exquisitely sensitive to oxygen
[64, 65]. For therapeutic purposes, this strain was rendered
nonpathogenic by eliminating a residential phage carrying
α-toxin and the resulting clone was named C. novyi-NT

[64]. Once administered as a single dose, C. novyi-NT spores
geminate locally within tumors and precisely spread through-
out the tumor and its microsatellites, causing hemorrhagic
necrosis, tumor cell lysis, and tumor destruction [66, 67], pre-
sumably by direct cell lysis and sensitization of the immune
system, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. A
variety of syngeneic and xenograft experimental tumors
across multiple animal species have successfully been treated
with C. novyi-NT spores, including syngeneic and xenograft
orthotopic glioblastomas in rats [64–68]. Notably, C. novyi-
NT spores have already been evaluated in companion dogs
with spontaneous peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and clinical
responses were seen in > 50% of the animals, with 28.5% of
animals having complete responses [66]. A phase I human
trial with C. novyi-NT spores is currently ongoing for patients
with recurrent sarcoma (NCT01924689).

The Role of Chemoprevention in MPNST and NF1

As current MPNST-targeted therapies are largely ineffective, a
multistep genetic transformation has been proposed to under-
lie MPNST evolution, and a high-risk population among the
NF1 patients (e.g., patients who carry a microdeletion) can be
easily identified, early chemoprevention has gained the atten-
tion of some research groups. The success of chemopreven-
tion, that is, the use of drugs to reduce the risk of the devel-
opment of cancer, has been impressively demonstrated in mul-
tiple epithelial malignancies, particularly breast, prostate, and
colorectal cancers with the use of selective estrogen receptor
modulators (e.g., tamoxifen and raloxifen), 5α-reductase in-
hibitors (e.g., finasteride), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in-
hibitors, a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which
inhibited the appearance of colorectal polyps in various famil-
ial colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes [69].

A substantial body of work supports the evidence that
chronic inflammation may contribute to a variety of cancers
by inducing proneoplastic mutations, resistance to apoptosis,
and environmental changes such as stimulation of angiogen-
esis [70]. COX-2 overexpression, which is triggered by in-
flammation, was detected in 2/3 of NF1-related MPNSTs
and has been linked to carcinogenesis and angiogenesis [71],
whereas the inhibition of COX-2 resulted in significant anti-
tumor responses in various NF1 patient-derived MPNST cell
lines [72, 73]. Likewise, manipulations to the tumor environ-
ment by inhibiting recruitment of immune cells via BRD4
inhibitors is an exciting strategy that is currently actively pur-
sued and could potentially delay or prevent the malignant
transformation of MPNSTs. This is particularly important in
patients with NF1 microdeletions, where SUZ12 is known to
be co-deleted with NF1. However, whether these strategies
truly affect the clinical course of pNFs or MPNSTs remains
to be determined in the future.

Conclusion

MPNST is a very rare primary cancer of the peripheral ner-
vous system that occurs with increased incidence in the setting
of NF1 and carries a poor prognosis. Although no treatment
standard has been established yet, active work is underway to
determine the optimal “standard” approach for these tumors,
including defining the role of traditional cytotoxic chemother-
apies, radiation, and radical surgical approaches, such as am-
putation, and with the consideration that both the cancer and
the treatments directed against the cancer may cause irrevers-
ible nerve injury. Even with the most aggressive standard in-
terventions, there is no guarantee of long-term survival, and
these cancers will likely recur.

However, there is also reason for guarded optimism in the
field. Remarkable advancements have been made in further-
ing our understanding of the molecular and pathophysiologic
underpinnings of MPNSTs that identified novel oncogenic
targets and inspired new therapeutic approaches in multiple
directions. Indeed, there are more NF1-specific MPNST clin-
ical therapeutics in development at the moment than there ever
have been previously.

Many challenges to the successful development of promis-
ing therapeutic approaches remain. Firstly, these tumors arise
from the same mesenchymal origin of normal nerve elements,
as well as some of the most resistant cancer’s known.
Secondly, there is a very clear role of the microenvironment
in both benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors that may
result in a constant flux of factors contributing to tumor het-
erogeneity and resistance and may highlight the need of per-
sonalized medicine. Finally, as these are rare tumors, more
efficient clinical trial designs are critical. This paired with
our rapidly emerging understanding of the tumor pathophys-
iology (including the discovery that allows consideration of
therapeutics that prevent MPNSTs) and entirely novel thera-
peutic approaches raises hope that meaningful therapeutics for
MPNST are forthcoming in the near future.
