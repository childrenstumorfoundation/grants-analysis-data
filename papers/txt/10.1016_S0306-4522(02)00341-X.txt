AbstractöNeuropathic pain is induced by injury or disease of the nervous system. Studies aimed at understanding the
molecular pathophysiology of neuropathic pain have so far focused on a few known molecules and signaling pathways in
neurons. However, the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain appears to be very complex and remains poorly understood.
A global understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain is needed for a better understanding
of the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropathic pain. Towards this end, we examined global gene expression
changes as well as the pathobiology at the cellular level in a spinal nerve ligation neuropathic pain model using DNA
microarray, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. We found that the behavioral hypersensitivity that is
manifested in the persistent pain state is accompanied by previously undescribed changes in gene expression. In the DRG,
we found regulation of: (1) immediate early genes; (2) genes such as ion channels and signaling molecules that contribute
to the excitability of neurons; and (3) genes that are indicative of secondary events such as neuroin£ammation. In
addition, we studied gene regulation in both injured and uninjured DRG by quantitative PCR, and observed di¡erential
gene regulation in these two populations of DRGs. Furthermore, we demonstrated unexpected co-regulation of many
genes, especially the activation of neuroin£ammation markers in both the PNS and CNS. The results of our study
provide a new picture of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the complexity of neuropathic pain and suggest that
chronic pain shares common pathobiology with progressive neurodegenerative disease. ß 2002 IBRO. Published by

Neuropathic pain is de¢ned as pain initiated or caused
by primary lesions or dysfunction in the nervous system.
It is generally classi¢ed according to the etiology of the

polyneuropathy (e.g. diabetes, HIV), mononeuropathy
or multiple mononeuropathy (e.g. diabetes, cancer, car-
cinomatous neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia), as well
as CNS injury (e.g. post-stroke pain, spinal injury, multi-
ple sclerosis). Neuropathic pain is clearly di¡erent from
transient (physiological) pain in terms of etiology, the
nature of the pain, as well as the mechanisms of pain
generation. Physiological pain is transient in nature and
elicits a coordinated, re£exive response that prevents fur-
ther damage or promotes healing. Neuropathic pain usu-
ally is persistent, and nerve injury can produce sensory/
motor de¢cits and other paradoxical sensations of a
qualitative nature, such as hyperesthesias (hightened
but non-painful appreciation of sensation), paresthesias
(tingling and prickling sensation) and dysesthesias
(unpleasant or painful sensations). The qualitative di¡er-
ences in sensation suggest that nerve injury leads to a
reorganization of sensory transmission pathways that
persists long after healing has occurred. Such a reorgan-
ization in the nervous system suggests that simple knowl-
edge of pain pathways and neurotransmission is not
enough to understand the complexity of chronic neuro-
pathic pain (Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000; Woolf and
Salter, 2000; Taylor, 2001; Zimmermann, 2001). So

far, the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain remains
poorly understood.

The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain has been
investigated using rat peripheral nerve injury models
such as chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve
(Bennett and Xie, 1988), partial sciatic nerve ligation
(Seltzer et al., 1990), and L5 and L6 spinal nerve ligation
(SNL) (Kim and Chung, 1992). Both peripheral and cen-
tral mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of
these neuropathic pain models. There is compelling evi-
dence demonstrating that hyperalgesia, allodynia, and
ongoing pain associated with peripheral nerve injury
re£ect, at least in part, changes in the excitability of
primary a¡erent neurons (Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000;
Woolf and Salter, 2000; Taylor, 2001; Zimmermann,
2001). One particularly important change is the develop-
ment of ongoing or ectopic activity of primary sensory
neurons, that may induce changes in the CNS thought to
be responsible for allodynia. Central mechanisms include
central sensitization, disinhibition of dorsal horn inhibi-
tory neurons, reorganization of neuronal circuits in the
dorsal horn, and changes in descending pain facilitation
and pain inhibition (Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000; Woolf
and Salter, 2000; Taylor, 2001; Zimmermann, 2001).
Both the peripheral and central mechanisms involve
changes in gene expression. Changes in gene expression,
protein expression and post-translational protein modi¢-
cation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord
have all been reported (Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000;
Woolf and Salter, 2000; Befort et al., 2001; Taylor,
2001; Zimmermann, 2001). However, most of the studies
revealed regulation of a few known genes at best, mostly
focused on genes expressed in neurons. A global picture
of gene regulation in the animal models of persistent
pain is greatly needed in order to better understand the
molecular mechanisms of neuropathic pain.

We, therefore, studied the global gene regulation in the
SNL model in both the DRG and spinal cord. The SNL
model
involves the tight ligation and injury of spinal
nerves L5 and L6, causing spontaneous pain, allodynia
and hyperalgesia. Allodynia and hyperalgesia develop on
the side of nerve injury (ipsilateral side) 3 days post-
nerve ligation and persist for weeks to months (Kim
and Chung, 1992). This chronic hypersensitivity may be
the result of long-term changes in gene expression and
subsequent pathobiology in the ipsilateral DRG and spi-
nal cord. To reveal a global picture of the pathophysiol-
ogy of neuropathic pain, we examined gene regulation in
the ipsilateral L4^L6 DRGs of the SNL animals using
DNA array technologies. In this gene pro¢ling study, we
identi¢ed regulation in injured L5 and L6 DRGs, as well
as in intact L4 DRG. There is much evidence now that
would argue in favor of the contribution of uninjured
neurons to the overall pain pro¢le. However, there are
con£icting reports on the contribution of injured vs.
uninjured a¡erents to neuropathic pain behavior (Gold,
2000). To understand the molecular mechanism of di¡er-
ential pathogenesis and to evaluate the contribution of
each population of DRGs to the pathophysiological pro-
cess, we examined gene regulation in injured L5^L6
DRGs as well as in the uninjured L4 DRGs separately

by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and immu-
nohistochemistry and found di¡erential gene regulation
in these two populations of DRGs. Furthermore, we
studied global gene regulation in the spinal cord and
identi¢ed common as well as di¡erential gene regulation
in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and CNS follow-
ing chronic SNL.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Animals and SNL

Male Sprague^Dawley rats (Taconic, Germantown, NY,
USA) weighing 200^300 g at the time of testing were maintained
in a climate-controlled room on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on
at 06:00) with food and water available ad libitum. All of the
handling of the animals and testing was performed in accor-
dance with the policies and recommendations of the Interna-
tional Association for the Study of Pain (Zimmermann, 1983)
and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of MRL, West Point, PA, USA.

SNL injury was induced using the procedure of Kim and
Chung (1992). Anesthesia was induced with 2% gaseous iso-
£uorane (for induction 3^5% and O2 500^700 Wl, for mainte-
nance 2^3% and O2 400^500 Wl). Following dorsal skin incision
and muscle separation, the posterior interarticular transverse
process of L/S1 was exposed and carefully removed with a
micro Rongeur. The L5 and L6 spinal nerves were tightly
ligated by a square knot with 6-0 silk thread. The muscles
were closed with 4-0 absorbable sutures and the skin was closed
with wound clips. Rats that exhibited motor de¢ciency (such as
paw dragging) or failure to exhibit subsequent tactile allodynia
were excluded from further testing (less than 5% of the animals
were excluded). Sham control rats underwent the same opera-
tion and handling as the experimental animals but without
SNL.

Behavioral testing

The assessment of tactile allodynia (i.e. decreased threshold to
paw withdrawal following probing with non-noxious mechanical
stimuli) consisted of measuring the withdrawal threshold of the
paw ipsilateral to the site of nerve injury in response to probing
with a series of calibrated von Frey ¢laments. Each ¢lament was
applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the ligated paw
of rats kept in suspended wire-mesh cages. The withdrawal
threshold was determined by sequentially increasing and
decreasing the stimulus strength (‘up-down’ method), analyzed
with a Dixon non-parametric test (Chaplan et al., 1994) and
expressed as the mean withdrawal threshold. Animals were
tested before surgery and only animals with a paw withdrawal
threshold greater than 10 g were used for the subsequent study.
Surgically treated animals were then tested on post-operative
days 3 and 12. Only those animals that showed allodynia
(paw withdrawal threshold smaller than 3 g) on both days
were used for tissue collection on post-operative day 13 (less
then 10% of the animals were excluded for tissue collection).

Tissue dissection and RNA preparation

Rat DRGs and spinal cord were dissected and rapidly frozen
in liquid nitrogen. The spinal cord tissue was then partially
thawed and further dissected on an ice-cold metal plate. Total
RNA from each sample was prepared using Trizol1 (Life Tech-
followed by RNeasy1
nologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA),
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA samples were analyzed by
denatured gel electrophoresis. In addition, total RNA quality
was assessed by capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer 2100 Agi-
lent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to ensure that the 28S:18S rRNA
ratio was s 1.0 for each sample.

A¡ymetrix microarray hybridization and staining

Hybridization probes were prepared according to A¡ymetrix
instruction (Lockhart et al., 1996). Five-micromolar primer
encoding the T7 RNA polymerase promoter linked to oligo-
dT24 was used to prime double-stranded cDNA synthesis from
each total RNA sample (25 Wg). cDNA synthesis reactions were
carried out at 42‡C using Superscript II RNaseH3 reverse tran-
scriptase (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). Second
strand cDNA synthesis was ¢nished using DNA polymerase I
and T4 DNA ligase. Each double-stranded cDNA sample was
puri¢ed by sequential phenol/chloroform extraction (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) and adsorption to silica (Qiaquick1 kit,
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Half of each cDNA sample was transcribed in
vitro into the copy RNA (cRNA) labeled with biotin-UTP and
biotin-CTP using the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript
Labeling kit
(Enzo Biochemicals, New York, USA). These
cRNA transcripts were puri¢ed using RNeasy1 columns (Qia-
gen, Hilden, Germany) and quantitated by measuring absorp-
tion at 260 nm/280 nm. Fifteen-microgram aliquots of each
cRNA sample were fragmented at 95‡C for 35 min in 40 mM
Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 100 mM KOAc, and 30 mM MgOAc to a
mean size of V50^150 nucleotides. Hybridization bu¡er (0.1 M
MES, pH 6.7, 1 M NaCl, 0.01% Triton, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin (BSA), 0.1 mg/ml H. sperm DNA, 50 pM control oligo
B2, and 1U eukaryotic hybridization control) was added to
each sample. Samples were then hybridized to RG-U34A micro-
arrays (A¡ymetrix) at 45‡C for 16 h. Microarrays were washed
and sequentially incubated with streptavidin phycoerythrin
(Molecular Probes), biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and streptavidin
phycoerythrin on the Fluidic Station (A¡ymetrix). Finally, the
microarrays were scanned with a dedicated Gene Array Scanner
(Hewlett Packard Instruments, TX, USA) to capture a £uores-
cence image.

A¡ymetrix microarray data analysis

analyzed

Samples were

using A¡ymetrix microarray
RG-U34A. For each probeset (an array of 16 pairs of oligonu-
cleotides for a speci¢c gene) an index of gene expression was
calculated and analyzed using the SAFER algorithm (Holder et
al., 2002) for all chip analysis. The SAFER gene expression
index is a robust and resistant measure of gene expression
which is an alternative to the ‘average di¡erence’ calculated by
the A¡ymetrix analysis software and the model-based expression
index proposed by Li and Wong (2001). Like Li and Wong’s
procedure, the procedure for calculating the SAFER gene index
involves both inter-array normalization and intra-array adjust-
ment for probe-speci¢c biases.

To analyze gene expression in DRG, di¡erences in mean level
of the gene expression index between ipsilateral and contralat-
eral samples were assessed using a paired t-test for each probe-
set. This model facilitated estimation of ratios comparing the
ipsilateral and contralateral samples and calculation of P values
testing whether the ratios are di¡erent from one (i.e. a ratio of
one implies no change between the means for the experimental
conditions). By ¢tting separate models for each probeset, di¡er-
ences were assessed using an error term that included biological
variability between samples and did not assume that this vari-
ability was the same for all genes. To analyze gene expression in
the spinal cord, two models were used. As in the DRG analysis,
gene expression between ipsilateral and contralateral spinal cord
samples was assessed using a paired t-test for each probeset.
Di¡erences between ipsilateral or contralateral spinal cord sam-
ples with sham samples were assessed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for each probeset.

Immunocytochemistry

se:OCT = 1:1 mixture, the ipsilateral and contralateral L4^L6
DRGs from the same animal were placed in sequential order
so that the identity of all DRGs was clear to the investigator
and all DRGs were subsequently processed in parallel. The tis-
sue was frozen and sections of 10 Wm were cut with a cryostat.
Tissue sections were washed several times with phosphate-bu¡-
ered saline (PBS), then treated with 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min and
then 0.3% H2O2 for 20 min followed by washing with PBS three
times. The sections were then incubated with blocking bu¡er
(3% BSA+3% donkey serum+0.1% Triton) for 1 h, followed
by incubation with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature. After washing with PBS 10 times, the sections
were incubated with secondary antibodies, AB enzyme reagent
(ABC kit, Vector) and developed using a Vector DAB staining
kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The anti-
body to GFAP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
and used at 1:20 dilution. Antibody to major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) II was purchased from CEDARLANE0 Lab-
oratories and used at 1:20 dilution.

QRT-PCR

Total RNA was treated with DNase I, Ampli¢cation Grade
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), to remove DNA contamina-
tion before cDNA synthesis. cDNA was synthesized with oligo
(dT)12^18 using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for
RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time PCR
analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism
7700 Sequence Detection System. Matching primers and £uores-
cence probes were designed for each of the genes using the
Primer Express program provided by Applied Biosystems.
Both forward and reverse primers were used at 900 nM. In all
cases, the ¢nal probe concentration was 250 nM. The PCR
reaction was performed in a ¢nal volume of 50 Wl using TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix containing AmpliTaq Gold DNA
Polymerase, AmpErase0 UNG, dNTPs (with dUTP), Passive
Reference 1, optimized bu¡er components (proprietary formu-
lation) and 1 Wl of cDNA template.

Primers and probes for GAPDH and interleukin (IL)-18 were
obtained from Applied Biosystems. The sequence of the primers
and probes used is listed in Table 1.

months (Kim and Chung, 1992). Throughout the time
course, allodynia was mostly observed in the ipsilateral
(same side as injury) hind paw of the animals but not in
the contralateral hind paw (Kim and Chung, 1992). Cor-
respondingly, electrophysiological, neurochemical, neu-
roanatomical, as well as gene
expression changes
thought to be important in neuropathic pain are mostly
restricted to the ipsilateral side of the injury at the
2-week time point, consistent with the neuroanatomy
of pain transmission pathways at the DRG and spinal
cord levels (Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000; Woolf and
et al., 2001; Taylor, 2001;
Salter, 2000; Befort
Zimmermann, 2001). We,
compared the
expression of genes in the ipsilateral DRGs with that
in the contralateral DRGs from the same animals. Sim-
ilarly, gene expression changes in the spinal cord were
compared. We chose to study gene expression at around
2 weeks (13 days) post-surgery when allodynia is consis-
tently demonstrated.

Global gene expression changes between ipsilateral and
contralateral DRGs as revealed by DNA microarray
analysis

A total of 40 SNL-treated animals were used in this
study. L4, L5 and L6 DRG samples on the ipsilateral
side of nerve ligation from 10 rats with SNL were pooled
(30 DRGs), and the L4^L6 DRG samples from the con-
tralateral side of
the same 10 animals were pooled
(30 DRGs) to form one pair of samples. RNA was pre-
pared from four such pairs of samples and expression of
genes was analyzed by hybridization with A¡ymetrix
chip RG-U34A, which contains 8799 probesets, each
consisting of an array of 16 pairs of oligonucleotides
for a speci¢c gene. Using the SAFER analysis approach
(see Experimental procedures), we
compared gene
expression between the ipsilateral DRG and contralateral
DRG samples. We found 1164 probesets gave P 6 0.05.
Among these, 126 probesets (corresponding to 102 genes)
show greater than two-fold up-regulation (Table 2),
52 probesets (corresponding to 46 genes) show greater
than two-fold down-regulation (a total of 148 genes
show greater than two-fold regulation). Twenty-three of
these 148 genes were detected to be regulated by more
than one probeset, demonstrating the consistency of
these samples and analyses (Tables 2 and 3, genes with
asterisks). In addition, we found evidence in the litera-
ture for regulation of 12 genes (corresponding to 14
probesets) among the 148 genes (Tables 2 and 3, genes
in bold) observed. These include up-regulated genes such
as galanin (Fukuoka et al., 1999; Ma and Bisby, 1999;
Macdonald et al., 2001), vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP) (Fukuoka et al., 1999; Macdonald et al., 2001),

Genes that show greater than two-fold up-regulation in the ipsilateral versus contralateral DRG with P 6 0.05 are listed according to their
broad functional categories. The gene expression fold increase for each probeset was calculated as the ratio of means of gene expression
index between ipsilateral DRG and that of contralateral DRG. The genes that are shown to be up-regulated by more than one probeset are
indicated with asterisks (the number of asterisks indicates the number of probesets that show up-regulation for that gene). The fold increase
for these genes is given as a range of fold increase detected by all the probesets for that gene. Genes that previously have been demonstrated
to be regulated are in bold. The genes that were tested by real-time PCR or immunohistochemistry are underlined.

al., 1989), GAP-43 (Cameron et al., 1991), muscle LIM
protein, acidic epididymal glycoprotein (Newton et al.,
2000) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)
(Tsujino et al., 2000), as well as down-regulated genes
such as substance P, somatostatin, and sodium channels
Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 (Marchand et al., 1994; Okuse et al.,
1997; Dib-Hajj et al., 1999). The presence of these genes
in our data set provides a level of validation of our
experimental results.

The 102 up-regulated genes represent several func-
tional categories including neuropeptides, cell cycle reg-
ulation and cell death, neuroin£ammation, ion channels,
receptor and signaling molecules, transcription factors,
and genes involved in tissue maintenance and plasticity
(Table 2). The 46 genes that are down-regulated encode
neuropeptides, ion channels, ion transporters, proteins
with synaptic functions, signaling molecules and others
(Table 3). We observed immediate early genes (IEGs)
such as ATF3 to be up-regulated about eight-fold, and
NGF induced gene (NGFI-A, krox-24/egr) to be up-
regulated two-fold. In addition, transcriptional repressor
of myelin-speci¢c genes is also up-regulated (Table 2).

Multiple ion channel genes that may directly contrib-
ute to altered excitabilities of ipsilateral sensory neurons
were observed to be regulated in the ipsilateral DRG.
Down-regulated ion channels
include both voltage-
gated and ligand-gated ion channels (Table 3). For
example, three voltage-gated sodium channel genes are
down-regulated. These include Nav1.8 (PN3/SNS) and

to three-fold less
include Kv1.4

Nav1.9 (NaN), which have previously been found to be
down-regulated (Okuse et al., 1997; Dib-Hajj et al.,
1999), and a novel observation that Nav1.1 (Na channel
I) is similarly decreased. Three voltage-gated delayed-rec-
found to be
ti¢er potassium channel genes were
expressed two-
in the ipsilateral
DRGs. These
(KCNA4), Kv4.3
(KCND3), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Ligand-gated ion chan-
nels that are down-regulated include kainate receptor
GLUR5, serotonin receptor 5-HT3R, and nicotinic ace-
tylcholine receptor K3 (Table 3). In contrast, the voltage-
gated calcium channel K2N shows up-regulation in our
study (Table 2), consistent with the previous studies
that demonstrated the up-regulation of this gene in the
SNL model and the partial sciatic nerve ligation model
(Luo et al., 2001; Newton et al., 2001).

A category of genes that may indirectly regulate the
excitability of sensory neurons include ion transporters,
neuropeptides, receptors, signaling molecules, and pro-
teins with synaptic functions. We found ion transporters
such as calmodulin-sensitive plasma membrane Ca2þ-
transporting ATPase, potassium-dependent sodium^cal-
cium exchanger, and Naþ,Kþ-ATPase K1 subunit are
down-regulated (Table 3). Genes encoding neuropeptides
appear to be most dynamically regulated in our studies.
For example, galanin, VIP and NPY are up-regulated
greater than 14-fold based on the estimation from micro-
array analysis (Table 2). Somatostatin and substance P,
as well as amylin are down-regulated more than three-

One of the striking outcomes of this microarray study
was the identi¢cation of regulation of multiple genes
within the same pathway. Genes involved in neuroin-
£ammation, as well as genes important in cell cycle reg-
ulation and cell death are among these pathways. For
example, complement protein genes C1q, C1r, and C1s
are up-regulated three- to nine-fold; MHCII subunits are

are indicators of neuroin£ammation and immune activa-

pathway provides clear evidence for the presence of dra-
matic neuroin£ammation in the DRG 13 days following
spinal nerve injury. In addition, genes important in cell
cycle regulation including cyclin D1, D2, and D3, genes
important for DNA synthesis and repair, and several
genes

Other genes that are regulated can be broadly catego-
rized as genes that are important for tissue maintenance,
remodeling, and plasticity. These include the genes for
LIM, epididymal glycoprotein and glial cell marker
GFAP which were previously described to be up-regu-
lated in a peripheral pain model (Woodham et al., 1989;
Newton et al., 2000). In addition, our data show that
PTHrP is up-regulated 10-fold. Extracellular matrix pro-
teins such as ¢bronectin and collagen K2 are up-regu-
lated two-
to three-fold. Matrix metalloproteinase

Gene expression changes as revealed by real-time PCR in
injured and uninjured DRGs

We sought to con¢rm gene expression changes of a
selected subset of genes using QRT-PCR. The genes
selected show expression change between two- and
37-fold by microarray. Since both populations of injured
L5^L6 DRGs and their uninjured ipsilateral L4 DRG
sensory neurons develop some form of ongoing or
ectopic activity following SNL, this model provides a
tool for studying the relative contribution of the injured
and uninjured neighboring DRGs to di¡erent aspects of
pain behavior (Gold, 2000). We therefore compared gene

from sham-operated animals

expression changes between ipsilateral and contralateral
samples, for each population of L5^L6 DRGs and L4
DRGs. Populations of L4 or L5^L6 DRGs in the ipsi-
lateral and contralateral sides were also compared to the
DRGs
to reveal gene
expression changes in relation to sham surgery. The
results of these comparisons are depicted in Figs. 2 and
3. In general, (1) the regulation of all 21 genes selected
were con¢rmed between ipsilateral and contralateral
L5^L6 DRGs, and between ipsilateral and sham L5^L6
DRGs (Figs. 2A and 3A); (2) a subset of the genes were
also shown to be regulated in ipsilateral L4 DRGs, how-
ever, the ratio of change was usually lower than that for
L5^L6 DRGs (Figs. 2B and 3B).

We con¢rmed gene up-regulation in the injured L5^L6
DRGs of two IEGs (ATF3 and NGFI-A), calcium chan-

in£ammation marker genes (MHCII L, IL-18 and C1q

(GADD45 and NADH dehydrogenase) (Fig. 2). We
also con¢rmed gene down-regulation in the ipsilateral
L5^L6 DRGs of six ion channels (5-HT3R, GLUR5,
Kv1.4, Kv9.3, Nav1.1, Nav1.9), a regulator of G protein
(RGP4), and a neuronal calcium sensor protein visinin
(Fig. 3). Some of the genes that were con¢rmed to be
regulated in L5^L6 DRG are not regulated in L4 DRG.
However, several of these genes that are regulated in the
L5^L6 DRG were also observed to be regulated in ipsi-
lateral L4 DRG. These include up-regulated genes
(ATF3, MHCII, pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP))
and down-regulated genes

of these genes in L4 DRG and injured L5^L6 DRG
may account for the di¡erential contributions of injured

behaviors.

Pathobiology at the cellular level in the DRG

We sought to investigate whether changes in gene
expression as detected by QRT-PCR re£ect changes at
the cellular level using immunohistochemistry with anti-
bodies to MHCII L and GFAP. Immunostaining with
antibodies against MHCII L chain revealed that there
was an increased number of positive cells present in the
injured L5 and L6 ipsilateral DRGs but not in L4 ipsi-
lateral DRGs (Fig. 4A^H and data not shown for L6
DRG), likely re£ecting the recruitment of immune cells
to the DRG. Moreover, consistent with the up-regula-
tion of GFAP at the mRNA level, an increased immu-
nostaining signal was detected in the satellite cells
surrounding the DRG neurons in injured L5 and L6

Genes are broadly categorized by biological functions. Genes that are also regulated in the DRGs are in bold ( s two-fold, P 6 0.05 for DRG)
or in italic (between 1.4- and two-fold, P 6 0.05 for DRG). The ratios of the means of gene expression index for ipsilateral versus contralat-
eral spinal cord (I vs. C ratio-SC), ipsilateral versus sham spinal cord (I vs. S ratio-SC), and ipsilateral vs. contralateral DRG (I vs. C-
DRG) are listed. P values from the paired t-test for the ipsilateral versus contralateral samples (Ppair I vs. C-SC), P values from the
ANOVA analysis for the ipsilateral versus sham spinal cord (Panova I vs. S-SC), and P values from the paired t-test for ipsilateral versus
contralateral DRG (Ppair I vs. C-DRG) are listed for each gene. Genes that are detected by more than one probeset are indicated by
asterisks following description (the number of asterisks indicates the number of probesets that show up-regulation for that gene). The values
for these genes are given as a range. Genes that were tested by QRT-PCR are underlined.

Gene expression changes at the spinal level

Having validated our gene expression results in the
DRGs, we sought to investigate whether gene expression
changes that were initially detected in the peripheral
DRG occur in other regions of the pain circuit such as
in the spinal cord. In the spinal cord as well as DRG, we
chose to study gene expression changes 13 days post-

SNL, a time period when tactile allodynia is consistently
demonstrated. We compared global gene expression in
the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord to that in the contra-
lateral lumbar spinal cord and to that from the sham
control by A¡ymetrix microarray analysis. For this
study, a total of 24 animals were used. Ipsilateral lumbar
spinal cord tissue from three animals was pooled and the
contralateral lumbar spinal cord tissue from the same
animals was pooled to make one pair of samples. Four
such pairs of samples were prepared. In addition, we
obtained four sham lumbar spinal cord samples, each
sample was from three animals. Gene expression pro¢les
were generated by hybridization to A¡ymetrix microar-

¢dence intervals and the symbol on each bar is the mean of fold change estimated from the assay performed in triplicate. All

ray RG-U34A. Table 4 lists all the genes with greater
than a 1.4-fold change and P 6 0.05 in comparing ipsi-
lateral and contralateral spinal cord gene expression. The
P value and ratio for ipsilateral vs. sham comparison, as
well as the P value and ratio for DRG ipsilateral vs.
contralateral samples are listed for comparison purposes.
As expected, ratios of gene expression between ipsilateral
and contralateral spinal cord are generally highly corre-
lated with those of the ipsilateral and sham comparison
(Table 4). In addition, we found that 22 of the 31 genes
that show greater than 1.4-fold change with P 6 0.05 in
the spinal cord also met this criterion in the DRGs
(Table 4, genes in bold or italicized). Among the genes
that are regulated in both the DRGs and the spinal
cord are genes important for neuroin£ammation and
immune activation, transcription factor ATF3, periph-
eral benzodiazepine receptor, purine receptor P2Y6.
Interestingly, a majority of the genes are regulated to a
greater degree in the DRGs. However, several chemo-
kines seem to be regulated to a greater extent in the
spinal cord (Table 4).

The regulation of 14 genes in the spinal cord was
tested by QRT-PCR, and 13 genes were con¢rmed
(Fig. 5). Importantly, we con¢rmed the up-regulation
of transcription factor ATF3 (eight-fold). We found
that chemokines B13 cytokine and MCP1 are up-regu-
lated by greater than six-fold, and other markers for
neuroin£ammation such as complement protein C1q L,
MRC-OX44,
interferon-induced GTP-binding protein,
MHCII L, interferon Q receptor, Fc Q receptor and C-C
chemokine receptor type 5 are all con¢rmed to be
up-regulated, providing clear evidence for neuroin£am-
mation in the spinal cord. PAP, peripheral benzodiaze-
pine receptor, and purine receptor P2Y6, which were
found to be up-regulated in the DRG, were also con-

¢rmed to be regulated in the spinal cord. The con¢rma-
tion of the regulation of tested genes suggests that similar
changes in gene expression may mediate the pathophys-
iology in the DRG and spinal cord.

DISCUSSION

We detected global changes of gene expression in
DRGs and spinal cord in the SNL model of neuropathic
pain. The categories of genes regulated include (1) IEGs,
(2) those that contribute to the ectopic activity of pri-
mary sensory neurons, (3) those that indicate secondary
pathogenesis events such as neuroin£ammation and cell
death, and (4) those that may indicate the common path-
ophysiology at the spinal cord level as well as in the
DRG. This study reveals gene expression changes that
are consistent with the literature. These results also pro-
vide new insight to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain
in animal models in the framework of both peripheral
and central mechanisms, as well as secondary patholog-
ical events. These ¢ndings may provide a scienti¢c basis
for further studies seeking better diagnosis and treatment
of neuropathic pain in patients.

Overall assessment of microarray analysis in our study

The reliability of these DNA microarray results is
demonstrated by the following three observations: (1) a
subset of the genes was observed to be consistently regu-
lated by multiple probesets on the microarray; (2) we
detected the regulation of 12 genes (by 14 probesets)
which have previously been described to be regulated;
(3) virtually all of the (34 out of 35) genes that we
chose to study further were con¢rmed to be regulated

by QRT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. Based on
the consistency and rate of independent con¢rmation,
many of the genes listed in the tables are likely to be
true positives.

Gene regulation reported here, however, is limited: the
A¡ymetrix chips we used have 8000 genes and do not
contain all the genes in the rat genome; genes that are
expressed at levels too low to be detected by this method
could also be missed. A few genes that have been
reported to be regulated in the DRG or spinal cord in
neuropathic pain models are not among those reported
here because either the regulation is small ( 6 two-fold
for DRG and 6 1.4-fold for the spinal cord) or gene
expression changes were not detected. For example,
ATP receptor P2X3 gene has been reported to be up-
regulated in the intact sensory neurons and down-regu-
lated in the injured sensory neurons (Tsuzuki et al.,
2001). We found that the gene is down-regulated in
L4^L6 DRGs and the expression ratio is 0.66 with

sodium channel was
reported to be up-regulated
(Dib-Hajj et al., 1999) but similar gene expression
changes were not observed in this microarray analysis.
In general, however, we con¢rmed most of the genes
previously reported, in addition to many novel gene reg-
ulations.

Regulation of transcription factors

Dramatic regulation of

transcription factor gene
expression was found in the DRGs whose axons were
injured. The regulation of these genes indicates that the
induction of transcription may control the regulation of
other genes that may be important for the maintenance
of hypersensitive neuropathic pain state. At the time
point we chose for our study, we found that ATF3 and
NGFI-A are up-regulated. The transcription factor
ATF3 has been found to be up-regulated in both sensory
and motor neurons following axotomy of peripheral
nerves (Tsujino et al., 2000). In our study, we examined
the regulation of this gene and found that this transcrip-
tion factor is up-regulated in both injured L5^L6 DRGs,
as well as in non-injured neighboring L4 DRG. In addi-
tion, we found that this gene is up-regulated in the ipsi-
lateral
been
demonstrated to co-express and co-localize with phos-
phorylated c-Jun (Takeda et al., 2000). Phosphorylated
c-Jun is known to mediate regeneration and cell death
(Zimmermann, 2001). It is possible that ATF3 works
together with phosphorylated c-Jun in these pathways.
One of the consequences of ATF3 up-regulation is neu-
rodegeneration and cell death. Our ¢nding that this gene
is induced in injured DRG and their neighbors, as well as
in the spinal cord suggests that the up-regulation of this
gene could mediate the spread of pathobiology following
nerve injury. In addition to the induction of ATF3, we
also found the induction of another IEG, NGFI-A, in
the injured ipsilateral DRG. This gene has been impli-
cated in neuronal plasticity and may regulate the expres-
sion of genes important for neuronal sensitization and
plasticity (Mataga et al., 2001).

Gene regulation in the uninjured neighboring DRG and
spinal cord

There is increasing evidence that uninjured neighbor-
ing neurons contribute to the development and mainte-
nance of the overall pain pro¢le. However, there are
con£icting reports on the relative contribution of injured
versus uninjured a¡erents to neuropathic pain behavior
(Ali et al., 1999; Gold, 2000; Li et al., 2000). Prior to our
study, one might argue di¡erential regulation in intact
versus injured ganglia. We have been able to speak to
this experimentally for 21 genes by comparing gene
expression in the intact L4 DRG and the injured
L5^L6 DRGs using QRT-PCR. We found that (1) all
genes tested are regulated in the L5^L6 DRGs, (2) some
genes such as MHCII L, PAP, Kv9.3, Nav1.1, RGP4,
visinin and Nav1.1 are also regulated in the adjacent
uninjured L4 DRGs. The genes tested are regulated in
the ipsilateral L5^L6 DRG to a much greater extent than
in L4 ipsilateral DRGs. The ¢nding of the di¡erential
gene regulation in intact and injured neurons provides
a molecular basis to evaluate the contribution of each
population to the pathophysiological process.

It is not known exactly how the uninjured adjacent
DRGs sense the injury and regulate gene expression.
However, there might be pathologic interactions between
the axons of L4 and L5^L6 DRGs. While the axons of
injured L5^L6 DRG undergo Wallerian degeneration,
electrical and chemical cross-excitations may occur
between injured and uninjured axons. This in turn
could send signals to the neuronal cell bodies to regulate
gene expression, most likely through the regulation of
IEGs such as ATF3, which regulates a host of other
genes including those that a¡ect neuronal excitability.

Some gene expression changes also occur in the spinal
cord, these include genes involved in neuroin£ammation
and neuroimmune activation, transcription factor ATF3,
peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, PAP, P2Y6, metal-
loproteinase-1 and others. To our knowledge, this is the
¢rst study that revealed the co-regulation of many genes
in the PNS and the CNS in a peripheral neuropathic
pain model and indicated that pathogenesis of neuro-
pathic pain may be similar in the CNS and the PNS.

The mechanisms for gene regulation in the spinal cord
after nerve injury are not entirely clear. However, ectopic
and ongoing activity have been demonstrated in C-¢bers
and A-¢bers
following nerve injury, which induce
changes in the excitability of dorsal horn neurons
(Suzuki and Dickenson, 2000). It is possible that abnor-
mal and persistent input to the dorsal horn neurons acti-
vates intracellular second messenger systems, which may
induce IEGs which control expression changes of other
genes. In addition, brain to spinal cord descending con-
trol pathways may also regulate gene expression in the
spinal cord (Field and Basbaum, 1999; Urban and
Gebhart, 1999; Ossipov et al., 2000).

Gene expression changes that may directly contribute to
abnormal excitability of primary a¡erent neurons

nels in the injured DRGs, some of which prior to this
study were not known to be regulated. These include the
down-regulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, vol-
tage-gated potassium channels, as well as ligand-gated
ion channels such as kainate receptor GLUR5,
iono-
tropic serotonin receptor 5-HT3R, and nicotinic receptor
3.

it

is important

to point out

Electrophysiological recordings have previously dem-
onstrated that C-¢bers and A-¢bers develop abnormal
excitability following peripheral nerve injury, a phenom-
enon which implicates changes in gene and protein
expression of ion channels. Sodium channels are among
the best studied in terms of gene regulation among the
ion channels in the neuropathic pain models. For exam-
ple, sodium channels Nav1.8 (SNS), and Nav1.9 (NAN)
have been found to be down-regulated but redistributed,
and Na channel type III was shown to be up-regulated in
the injured DRGs (Waxman et al., 1994). These changes
in sodium channels, particularly the redistribution of the
ion channels, have been described as the molecular mech-
anism of abnormal ectopic activity in a¡erent ¢bers. Our
study using microarray analysis and QRT-PCR con¢r-
mation revealed an additional Na channel, Nav1.1,
is
also down-regulated in injured DRGs. We do not
know if Nav1.1 is also redistributed in the peripheral
nerve. However,
that
Nav1.1 and Nav1.9 are also down-regulated in the ipsi-
lateral L4 DRG based on our real-time PCR analysis.
Further study is required to understand whether the reg-
ulation of these genes might contribute to spontaneous
activity in both injured and neighboring DRG neurons.
We discovered that multiple voltage-gated K-channels
are down-regulated in the ipsilateral DRGs. This is con-
sistent with electrophysiological studies which demon-
strated that nerve injury induced by the Chung model
of neuropathic pain leads to striking reductions in vol-
tage-gated Kþ current in DRG neurons (Everill and
Kocsis, 2000). Our study is the ¢rst that provides the
molecular mechanisms for the down-regulation of Kþ
current. We do not yet know the identity of the neurons
which have reduced expression of each of the subtypes of
potassium channel genes. However, Kv1.4 is the sole Kv1
subunit expressed in smaller diameter neurons, suggest-
ing that homomeric Kv1.4 channels predominate in
A- and C-¢bers arising from these cells (Rasband et
al., 2001). The reduced Kþ currents may contribute to
higher excitability of the injured sensory neurons, which
in turn can contribute to an abnormal pain state. In
addition, we found that Kv9.3 is also down-regulated
in the uninjured ipsilateral L4 DRG. The down-regula-
tion of this channel could contribute also to the neuronal
excitability of uninjured neighboring DRG.

We found that ligand-gated kainate receptor GLUR5
is down-regulated in the injured DRGs. GLUR5 has
been found to be expressed speci¢cally in the presynaptic
terminals of C-¢bers, especially in neurons that innervate
the inner layer of lamina II in the dorsal spinal cord
(Hwang et al., 2001). Electrophysiological studies have
demonstrated that this channel has an inhibitory role in
regulation of neurotransmission in presynaptic cells. Kai-
nate receptor agonists, acting at a presynaptic locus, can

reduce glutamate release from primary a¡erent sensory
synapses (Kerchner et al., 2001). It is possible that down-
regulation of this channel removes the inhibition of neu-
rotransmission from primary sensory neurons, resulting
in the hyperexcitability of these neurons.

Activation of peripheral 5-HT3 subtype of serotonin
receptor has been demonstrated to be pronociceptive.
Injury-induced persistent pain is signi¢cantly reduced
after functional elimination of
this receptor subtype
(Zeitz et al., 2002). We found that the 5-HT3 receptor
is dramatically reduced in the injured DRG. The
decreased expression of this gene is likely to be a com-
pensatory event.

Neuroin£ammation in the SNL model of
neuropathic pain

A remarkable concerted up-regulation of genes with
roles in in£ammation was found in our study, in both
the DRGs and in the ipsilateral spinal cord. It is not
surprising that such markers for in£ammation are regu-
lated in the DRGs, since DRG axons are the primary
injury site where cells of monocyte origin can be
recruited. Consistent with this ¢nding, we detected the
regulation of a textbook collection of genes that are
markers for neuroin£ammation. Using immunohisto-
chemical methods, we found that the number of cells
that are MHCII positive increased in injured DRGs,
indicating the recruitment of immune active cells to the
DRG. Interestingly, a majority of these markers for neu-
roin£ammation are also up-regulated in the ipsilateral
spinal cord. In addition, several chemokines and chemo-
kine receptors are also up-regulated in the spinal cord.
The up-regulation of these marker genes in spinal cord
may indicate activation of glia such as astrocytes and
microglia, which secrete chemokines
(Wood, 2000;
Boddeke, 2001). The induction of chemokines may in
turn induce in¢ltration of immune cells into the CNS
in the ipsilateral spinal cord. Indeed, microglia activation
has been described in various in£ammatory pain models
(Watkins and Maier, 1999). Increased immunoreactivity
to microglia marker OX44 and elevated levels of cyto-
kines such as IL-1L, IL-6, TNF-K in the spinal cord have
also been described in neuropathic pain models (DeLeo
et al., 1996, 1997). We found, in a separate study by
QRT-PCR, that the IL-1L, IL-1K, IL-6, and TNF-K
genes are all up-regulated in the ipsilateral L5+L6
DRG and spinal cord of SNL animals compared to
those from sham animals (Wang et al., unpublished
results). Our ¢nding of increased expression of many
cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-1L, chemokines such as
MIP-1, cell adhesion molecules such as MHCII, comple-
ment proteins, and the Fc Q receptor is consistent with
the activation of microglia. In addition, it is suggested
that following a focal peripheral nerve injury there is a
selective alteration in the integrity of the blood^brain
barrier at the level of the lumbar spinal cord (DeLeo
and Yezierski, 2001). In fact, there is evidence that alter-
ations in the tight junctions of the blood^brain barrier
are induced by peripheral
in£ammation pain states
(Huber et al., 2001). The alteration in the blood^brain

in nearby neurons and contribute

The role of glial activation in neuropathic pain behav-
iors following peripheral nerve injury is not clearly
understood. However, several possibilities may indicate
that glial activation plays an important role in the path-
ophysiology of neuropathic pain: (1) glial activation may
play an important role in the increase in spinal excitatory
amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate, which in
turn cause NMDA-mediated increase in intracellular cal-
cium levels
to
increased spinal neuron activity (Muller, 1992; Parpura
et al., 1994; McKenna et al., 1996); (2) glia also release a
variety of other substances thought to be important for
pain including nitric oxide and prostaglandins (Zielasek
and Hartung, 1996; Watkins and Maier, 1999; DeLeo
and Yezierski, 2001); (3) we found that multiple chemo-
kine genes are up-regulated. Secreted cytokines such as
IL-1 and TNF-K may potentiate pain behavior (DeLeo
et al., 1996; Wagner et al., 1998). Chemokines may play
an important role in recruiting immune cells into areas of
active in£ammation. In addition to the chemoattraction
of immune cells, chemokines may also contribute to the
pathogenesis by directly a¡ecting nociceptive signal
transduction (Boddeke, 2001). All these possibilities sug-
gest that glial activation may play a role in the patho-
physiology of neuropathic pain. Once
activated,
astrocytes and microglia form a positive feedback circuit
whereby substances released from microglia activate
astrocytes to release substances that further stimulate
microglia, and neuroexcitatory substances they release
could drive exaggerated pain states. In the subcutaneous
formalin-induced hyperalgesia model, disruption of glial
function reduced pain and thus suggested an important
role for spinal glia in the pathophysiology of pain
(Watkins et al., 1997).

Our ¢nding of complement protein up-regulation not
only represents evidence of an ongoing and signi¢cant
in£ammatory attack, but could also suggest that areas
of complement defense may co-localize with areas of
degeneration and cell death. Consistent with this impli-
cation, we found that several genes such as NADH
dehydrogenase, GADD45, and cyclin D1^D3, which
are indicative of cell death are also up-regulated in the
DRGs (Park et al., 2000).

An interesting phenomenon we observed is that the
markers for neuroin£ammation in our neuropathic pain
model are similar to those described in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD) and stroke (Walker, 2000). Basic research and
clinical studies have established that in£ammation may
play a role in the neurodegeneration that characterizes
AD, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain and
spinal cord injury, and demyelinating diseases such as
multiple sclerosis (Walker, 2000; Wood, 2000). Our
study underscores that neuroin£ammation may also
play an important role in neuropathic pain, although
in£ammation is most likely to arise as a secondary
response to primary events in the development of neuro-
pathic pain. It is important to recognize that, secondary
or not, CNS in£ammation almost always carries with it
the potential to do more damage than the etiology that

gave rise to it. Once established, neuroin£ammation may
become a signi¢cant contributor to neurodegeneration
and the behavioral consequence of neuropathic pain.

Apoptosis and cell death

We found that genes involved in cell cycle regulation
and genes potentially involved in cell death are up-regu-
lated in the DRG. These include cyclin D1^3, GADD45
and NADH dehydrogenase. In the case of cell cycle pro-
teins, there is evidence that cell cycle regulators are
up-regulated during some circumstances of neuronal
death. Further evidence supporting the role of cyclin D
in neuronal death comes from the fact that inhibition of
cell cycle elements is protective in certain paradigms of
neuronal death (Park et al., 2000). In addition to NADH
dehydrogenase, GADD45 and cyclin Dl, D2 and D3, we
also found the up-regulation of activation transcription
actor ATF3. This transcription factor has been found to
co-localize and co-express with phosphorylated c-Jun
(Takeda et al., 2000). It is known that phosphorylation
of c-Jun without c-fos is an initial event in a long-lasting
cascade of transcriptional processes resulting in either
axonal regeneration or in cell death (Zimmermann,
2001). Our results are consistent with other evidence
that in the DRGs and the spinal cord, apoptosis and
cell death are increased following peripheral nerve injury
(Himes and Tessler, 1989; Lekan et al., 1997; Whiteside
and Munglani, 2001). In addition, the genes that we dis-
covered may be used as markers for potential cell death
in neuropathic pain models.

Gene expression changes in the pathogenesis of
neuropathic pain and therapeutic implications

Persistent abnormal pain develops following peripheral
nerve injury in both animal models and patients. Our
study of the genome-wide expression changes following
peripheral nerve injury in animal models, when com-
bined with early electrophysiological studies, as well as
cellular and molecular characterizations, provides a
clearer picture of gene expression changes that may con-
tribute
to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain.
Repeated and persistent abnormal
following
nerve injury activates a number of intracellular second
messenger systems,
including the phosphorylation by
protein kinases such as PKC and mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase (Ji and Woolf, 2001). Intracellular signaling
cascades result in IEG induction and maintenance which
control widespread changes in gene and protein expres-
sion. These changes lead to changes in neuronal excit-
ability and neuronal plasticity, as well as secondary
events such as neuroin£ammation and cell death. Careful
study of the relationship of di¡erent gene regulation is
important for further understanding of the pathogenesis
of neuropathic pain.

input

In summary, we have identi¢ed global gene expression
changes and novel molecular pathobiology following
SNL in the DRG and spinal cord. While some of the
changes in gene expression we discovered may re£ect
regeneration and repair, others may contribute to the

pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. We found dramatic
new changes in gene expression of ion channels and sig-
naling molecules that directly a¡ect the excitability of
neurons in both DRGs and the spinal cord. In addition,
we found gene expression di¡erences that re£ect second-
ary events which may cause a progression of the disease,
but over time could become major contributors to the
pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Future
clinical
research for treatment of neuropathic pain should con-

sider both the modulation of neuronal activity and the
prevention of further disease progression.
