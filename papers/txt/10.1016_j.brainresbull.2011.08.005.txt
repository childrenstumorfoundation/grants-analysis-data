Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common genetic disorder affecting the human nervous
system, is characterized by the development of multiple benign Schwann cell tumors in skin and
large peripheral nerves. These neoplasms, which are termed dermal and plexiform neurofibromas
respectively, have distinct clinical courses; of particular note, plexiform, but not dermal,
neurofibromas often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy occurring in NF1 patients. In recent years, a
number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created to investigate the molecular
mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of these tumors. These models have been designed to
address key questions including: 1) whether NF1 loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for
tumorigenesis; 2) what cell type(s) in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal neurofibromas,
plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs; 3) how the tumor microenvironment contributes to
neoplasia; 4) what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-MPNST progression; 5) what
role different neurofibromin-regulated Ras proteins play in this process and 6) how dysregulated
growth factor signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the major
findings from each of these models and their limitations as well as how discrepancies between
these models may be reconciled. We also discuss how information gleaned from these models can
be synthesized to into a comprehensive model of tumor formation in peripheral nervous system
and consider several of the major questions that remain unanswered about this process.

mortality in afflicted individuals. This class of tumors is also common, representing 8.9% of
the nervous system neoplasms resected in the United States between 2004 and 2006 [13].
While these tumors do occur sporadically, they are also often seen in association with the
genetic disorders neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2),
schwannomatosis, and Carney complex. Early transgenic modeling of these tumors thus
focused on replicating the genetic defects seen in human patients with these disorders. This
work provided insights into the role these mutated genes play in key signaling cascades, how
they interact with other intratumoral abnormalities (e.g., aberrant growth factor signaling)
and how their mutation enhances tumorigenesis via effects on the tumor microenvironment.
These findings enabled the production of a second generation of genetically engineered
murine (GEM) models that have further refined our understanding of tumorigenesis in the
peripheral nervous system.

As the pathogenesis of NF1-related neoplasms (neurofibromas and MPNSTs) has been most
extensively studied, we will focus on NF1-related GEM models in this review. We will first
discuss the pathology of human NF1-related peripheral nerve sheath tumors, the genetic
syndrome with which they are associated and our current understanding of the function(s) of
the NF1 gene. We will then consider the mouse models that have been developed to
investigate the mechanisms underlying NF1-related PNS tumorigenesis and the fundamental
new insights that resulted from these models.

2. Pathology of Human Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors and Their
Association with NF1
2.1 The Anatomy of Peripheral Nerve and Its Implications for the Pathogenesis of
Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors

As peripheral nerve sheath tumors are derived from cells normally found in peripheral
nerve, it is useful to first consider the composition and architecture of this complex tissue.
The outermost layer of the nerve, the epineurium (Fig. 1), is composed of dense connective
tissue and contains the highly anastamotic vascular supply of the nerve (the vasa nervorum).
Within the epineurium, fascicles of nerve fibers are ensheathed by the perineurium, a dense
concentric layer of specialized cells. Although perineurial cells were initially thought to be
Schwann cell variants, it is now evident that these cells are not even of neural crest origin
[36], being instead derived from the central nervous system (CNS) [44]. These perineurial
cells, together with the neural vasculature, form a diffusion barrier (the “blood-nerve”
barrier) that maintains endoneurial homeostasis. The compartment within the perineurium,
the endoneurium, contains axons projecting into the periphery and their investing glia, the
Schwann cells. The endoneurial space between axon-Schwann cell units contains collagen,
fibroblasts, resident tissue macrophages and mast cells.

Neurofibromas are benign tumors that arise within peripheral nerve. Consistent with this
origin, the cellular composition of a neurofibroma arising within a large nerve or nerve
plexus (a plexiform neurofibroma) resembles a disordered version of the endoneurium (Fig.
2). These lesions contain large numbers of Schwann cell-like elements (referred to below as
Schwann cells for simplicity’s sake; however, see Section 3.3 for a discussion of the origin
of these cells) and fibroblasts that diffusely infiltrate along the length of the nerve,
separating and spreading apart entrapped axons. Large numbers of mast cells are also
typically present in neurofibromas. This cellular composition, considered together with
evidence indicating that Schwann cells are the neoplastic cell type within neurofibromas
(see below), implies that the initial steps in neurofibroma formation occur within the
endoneurium and that interactions with other cell types found in this microenvironment

shape the course of tumor formation. Further, the early stages of neurofibroma growth are
likely constrained and shaped by the perineurium.

In contrast, MPNSTs, the highly aggressive sarcomas that develop from plexiform
neurofibromas, are overwhelmingly composed of cells with the morphologic,
immunohistochemical (Fig. 3A, B) and ultrastructural characteristics of Schwann cells.
Indeed, these observations, considered together with the observation that NF1 loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) is found in Schwann cells but not other cell types intrinsic to
neurofibromas, provide strong evidence that Schwann cells are the primary neoplastic cell
type in both neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Interestingly, the conventional schwannomas
arising in patients with schwannomatosis and NF2 (Fig. 3C) as well as the melanotic
schwannomas occurring in Carney complex (Fig. 3D-F) are also composed of neoplastic
Schwann cells. However, these benign lesions are composed almost exclusively of mature
Schwann cells and lack other cellular components found in peripheral nerve. It is also
exceedingly uncommon for schwannomas to undergo malignant progression. Considered
together, these observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for neurofibroma and
MPNST pathogenesis are distinct from those driving the development of schwannomas.

Histologically, the GEM PNS tumors described below closely resemble their human
counterparts. Neurofibromas from early GEM models (Nf1flox/−; Krox20-Cre and Nf1+/−;
Nf1−/− chimeras; see section 3.1 Initial Nf1 Knockout Models) contain long spindle-shaped
cells on a myxoid background with extensive mast cell infiltration and collagen deposition
while lacking marked hypercellularity, nuclear atypia or frequent mitotic figures [15, 73,
97]. Staining for S100β, a marker of Schwann cells, was observed in some but not all of
these tumors; electron microscopy was required to establish the presence of cells with
morphologic features characteristic of Schwann cells in S100β- tumors. Based on these
features, a panel of pathologists classified these tumors as GEM grade I neurofibromas [73].
Although not reviewed by this panel, the neurofibromas formed by the more recently
developed GEM models discussed in this review appear to share these same histologic traits.
Initial investigator-assigned designations of these GEM neurofibromas as plexiform,
however, could not be confirmed by the panel [73].

This panel of pathologists was also cautious in their classification of the higher grade PNS
lesions observed in early models (cis-linked Nf1+/−/p53+/− mice). Although these GEM
lesions share a number of histologic traits with human MPNSTs – including an association
with a peripheral nerve or neurofibroma, high cellularity, brisk mitotic activity, nuclear
pleomorphism and anaplasia – the panel recommended that they be classified as GEM grade
III peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) rather than as MPNSTs. The reason for this is
that the panel felt that the term “malignant” was inappropriate due to a lack of information
about the clinical course of these tumors at the time of their report [73]. While we recognize
this point, we will refer to these GEM tumors as MPNSTs below for simplicity’s sake.

2.2 Clinical Characteristics of NF1 and Function of the Gene Mutated in this Disorder

NF1 is the most common genetic disease affecting the human nervous system, occurring in 1
in 3500 newborn infants. Manifestations of this autosomal dominant disease include
learning disabilities, bony dysplasias, pigmentary lesions of the skin (café-au-lait macules,
axillary freckling) and iris (Lisch nodules), and the development of a variety of tumor types
(optic gliomas, glioblastomas, pheochromocytomas and juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia). As implied by the name of the disorder, however, neurofibromas are the hallmark
lesion of NF1. It is widely recognized that distinct neurofibroma subtypes occur in NF1
patients and several classification schemes are currently in use for defining these subtypes.
However, many investigators prefer to simply classify neurofibromas as dermal or plexiform
variants as this has important clinical implications. Dermal neurofibromas arise in skin,

typically developing in NF1 patients entering puberty or in women with NF1 that have
become pregnant. Interestingly, dermal neurofibromas virtually never undergo malignant
progression. In contrast, plexiform neurofibromas are often congenital. Individuals with
plexiform neurofibromas also have an 8-13% lifetime risk that their tumors will progress to
become MPNSTs, the most common malignancy developing in NF1 patients.

Linkage analyses were initially used to establish that the gene mutated in NF1 patients was
localized to the long arm of human chromosome 17 [5, 70]. Transcription of this gene gives
rise to a 13 kilobase mRNA [12, 85, 91] which encodes the 220 kDa (2,818 amino acid)
tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin. Neurofibromin contains a domain homologous to
the yeast GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) IRA1 and IRA2, which function as negative
regulators of the yeast RAS1 and RAS2 proteins. As predicted by this homology,
neurofibromin’s GAP-related domain (GRD) stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of the
mammalian Ras homologues, catalyzing the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, which
inactivates these small growth-promoting G-proteins (Fig. 4). In keeping with these in vitro
observations, Ras proteins are hyperactivated in nerve sheath tumors that have lost NF1, and
reintroduction of the NF1 GRD into tumor cells decreases Ras activation and slows tumor
cell proliferation [4, 54, 91].

Although most studies of neurofibromin action have focused on its GRD domain, this
domain is only a small portion of the protein (Fig. 4). Several other domains have been
identified within neurofibromin, including a tubulin-binding domain (TBD) [7], a cysteine/
serine-rich domain (CSRD) [32], a Sec14-homology domain (Sec14) [3], a pleckstrin
homology domain (PH) [17] and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) [79]. The TBD and
CSRD may modulate neurofibromin’s ability to regulate Ras, as the GAP activity of
neurofibromin is substantially reduced upon binding to tubulin [7] and is increased by
CSRD phosphorylation [52]. At present, the function of the bipartite lipid binding and
exchange motif created by the adjacent Sec14 and PH domains [17, 88] is unclear, as is the
significance of the NLS. Neurofibromin also interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
through a C-terminal region surrounding the NLS and can regulate FAK-mediated substrate
adherence in serum deprived cells via an unknown mechanism [45]. Finally, neurofibromin
modulates cAMP levels. Curiously, neurofibromin effects on cAMP levels are cell-type
dependent, as neurofibromin loss elevates cAMP levels in Schwann cells [18, 38] and
reduces them in astrocytes [20]. The mechanism responsible for these effects is unknown.
However, since the neurofibromin CSRD contains cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA)
phosphorylation sites, it is reasonable to postulate that these differential effects result from
interruption of a feedback loop.

3. Mouse Models of Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
3.1 Initial Nf1 Knockout Models

In 1994, the Copeland and Weinberg labs independently described knockout mice with null
mutations of Nf1 exon 31, a region that is often mutated in human NF1 patients. Both
groups found that homozygous Nf1Δ31/Δ31 mice died by embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) due to
cardiac failure [8, 33]. Defects in renal, hepatic, and skeletal muscle development were also
observed [8]. However, nervous system pathology was limited to enlargement of
sympathetic ganglia secondary to neuronal hyperplasia [8] and, less commonly,
exencephaly. The former phenomenon may reflect the prolonged proliferation [82] and
enhanced neurotropin-independent survival [81] that occurs in embryonic sympathetic
neurons following Nf1 loss.

Interestingly, complete Nf1 loss had quite different effects on Schwann cells. In keeping
with neurofibromin’s role as a negative regulator of Ras, Ras activation was increased in

cultured Nf1Δ31/Δ31 Schwann cells. As activated Ras generally promotes cell growth, the
initial expectation was that these cells would show enhanced mitogenesis. However,
Nf1Δ31/Δ31 Schwann cells instead demonstrated reduced proliferation in response to
neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) stimulation and axonal contact [39], two classic Schwann cell
mitogenic stimuli. It was thus proposed that Ras hyperactivation in these cells led to
oncogene-induced senescence, similar to that previously observed when activated Ras
mutants were introduced into Schwann cells in the absence of other oncogenic signals [64].
However, it was unclear why Nf1 loss would produce senescence in Schwann cells but
hyperplasia in sympathetic neurons, particularly given the absence of the latter finding in
NF1 patients.

The phenotype of heterozygous Nf1Δ31/+ mice only created more questions. Contrary to
expectations, these mice did not develop neurofibromas, pigmentation defects, or Lisch
nodules [8, 33]. However, approximately 15% of Nf1Δ31/+ mice did develop adrenal tumors,
many of which showed Nf1 LOH. These lesions were pheochromocytomas [33], a tumor
type which is often observed in human NF1 patients but is very rare in wild-type mice.
Interestingly, their pathogenesis was strain-specific, as the elevated pheochromocytoma
incidence observed in Nf1Δ31/+ mice on a mixed sv/129 × C57BL/6 genetic background
disappeared when the Nf1Δ31/+ allele was bred onto a sv/129 background [76]. Otherwise,
the Nf1Δ31/+ mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice until after 12 months in age,
when their survival declined sharply due to the development of a lymphomas, leukemias,
lung adenocarcinomas, hepatomas, fibrosarcomas and adrenal tumors [33]. As these
malignancies are also normally observed in older (>24 months) wild-type mice [9], this
suggested that germline loss of a single Nf1 allele merely accelerated the development of
tumors to which the mice were already predisposed.

One possible explanation for the lack of neurofibroma formation in the Nf1Δ31/+ mice was
that the acquisition of a second-hit mutation within one or more cell types in peripheral
nerve was the rate limiting step for neurofibroma generation. To test this hypothesis,
chimeric mice were generated by injecting Nf1−/− embryonic stem cells into Nf1+/− C57BL/
6 blastocysts [15]. Although those animals with the highest degree of chimerism died by one
month of unknown causes, mice with an intermediate degree of chimerism developed
multiple plexiform neurofibromas. Consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 LOH in Schwann
cells was required for neurofibroma development, the tumors were composed largely of
Nf1−/− Schwann cells.

The presence of Nf1−/− Schwann cells in the plexiform neurofibromas formed in the
Nf1−/−;Nf1+/− chimeric mice suggested that Schwann cell Nf1 LOH was required for
neurofibroma generation. However, it did not establish that such LOH was sufficient for
plexiform neurofibroma pathogenesis. To address that question, Nf1flox/flox mice were bred
to mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a Schwann cell-active promoter
(Krox20-Cre mice) [97]. Peripheral nerves from these mice showed only mild Schwann cell
hyperplasia with no evidence of neurofibroma formation, despite confirmation of Cre
expression and Nf1 loss in Schwann cells from these animals. However, when conditional
Nf1 ablation in Schwann cells occurred on an Nf1 heterozygous background (Nf1flox/−;
Krox20-Cre mice), lesions with the histologic features of human neurofibromas developed
in all of the animals by 1year of age [97]. These findings painted a much more complex
picture of the neurofibroma pathogenesis than had been previously appreciated. In
particular, the discovery that Nf1 loss in Schwann cells only resulted in neurofibroma
formation when all other cell types were Nf1 haploinsufficient suggested for the first time
that the presence of susceptible non-neoplastic cell types in the tumor microenvironment
was critical for neurofibroma development.

3.2 Mouse Models Probing the Role of the Tumor Microenvironment in Neurofibroma
Formation

A key question that is still incompletely answered is precisely which cell types in the tumor
microenvironment interact with neoplastic Schwann cells to promote neurofibroma
pathogenesis. Although Nf1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell types – including mast cells,
fibroblasts and vascular elements – could contribute to this process, the most convincing
work to date has focused on mast cells. These cells appear to function as critical
intermediaries between Nf1−/− Schwann cells and other Nf1+/− cell types in the
microenvironment. Nf1−/− Schwann cells secrete elevated levels of Kit ligand, a growth
factor which activates the c-Kit membrane tyrosine kinase. Nf1+/− mast cells show increased
c-Kit expression [19] and an enhanced chemotactic response to Kit ligand relative to wild-
type mast cells [93], leading to increased recruitment of these cells into the nascent tumor.
Kit ligand also induces enhanced activation, degranulation [14], and TGF-β secretion in
Nf1+/− mast cells [92]. TGF-β in turn acts upon Nf1+/− fibroblasts and promotes increased
production of collagen [92], a molecule which is found in abundance in neurofibromas.

An essential role for mast cells in neurofibroma formation has been elegantly demonstrated
using bone marrow transplantation in knockout mice. As noted above, Nf1flox/flox;Krox20-
Cre mice do not develop neurofibromas. However, when Nf1flox/flox;Krox20-Cre mice were
lethally irradiated and transplanted with Nf1+/− bone marrow, they developed multiple
plexiform neurofibromas that were infiltrated by donor mast cells [94]. In contrast, when
donor marrow from Nf1+/− mice with hypoactive c-Kit receptors (Nf1+/−; c-KitW41/W41
mice) was used, no tumors formed, indicating that c-Kit signaling in bone marrow-derived
elements was critical for neurofibroma formation. Consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1+/−
mast cells are critically important for neurofibroma pathogenesis, no neurofibromas formed
in lethally irradiated Nf1flox/−;Krox20-cre mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow,
despite the presence of Nf1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the
peripheral nerve [94].

Mast cell recruitment is also apparently important for the continued growth of existing
neurofibromas. Treating eight-to-nine month old Nf1flox/−; Krox20-Cre animals with
established plexiform neurofibromas with 200mg/kg/day of the c-Kit inhibitor imatinib
mesylate substantially reduced the volume of their dorsal root ganglia as well as mast cell
recruitment and hypercellularity in nerve segments proximal to the dorsal root. This
treatment also decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis within the plexiform
neurofibromas [94]. Following this demonstration, 350mg/m2 imatinib mesylate was
administered to a child with life-threatening airway compression produced by an
unresectable plexiform neurofibroma. This treatment produced a 70% reduction in tumor
volume [94], consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment of Nf1+/− mast cells is critical
for neurofibroma maintenance as well as formation.

Although it is clear that mast cell recruitment is essential for neurofibroma formation and
that Nf1 haploinsufficiency in other cell types cannot overcome this requirement, it remains
to be determined whether Nf1 haploinsufficiency in these other cell types promotes
neurofibroma growth. It is also unclear what protumorigenic function(s) are performed by
the recruited mast cells after their arrival in the nascent neurofibroma and whether these
effects are directed at the neoplastic Schwann cells or other intratumoral cell types. At
present, an entire series of protumorigenic interactions between the various cell types
composing a neurofibroma can be envisioned (Fig. 5). However, the existence and
functional significance of most of these interactions remains to be determined.

3.3 The Neurofibroma Cell-of-Origin Debate

Although the neoplastic cells in plexiform neurofibromas clearly have schwannian
characteristics, the initial Nf1 knockout models did not establish whether these neoplastic
cells were derived from mature Schwann cells or a more primitive precursor (see Fig. 6 for
an illustration of the stages of Schwann cell differentiation). To address this question,
Nf1flox/− mice have been crossed to animals in which Cre expression was directed by
promoters active at different stages in Schwann cell development. Elimination of Nf1
expression in neural crest cells, the earliest stage in Schwannian differentiation, was
achieved by mating Nf1flox/− mice with Wnt1-Cre, Mpz-Cre, and Pax3-Cre animals.
Although these mice had abnormal sympathetic ganglia and adrenal glands and died at birth,
they did not develop neurofibromas [26]. Given the early death of these animals, it is
conceivable that, had they survived, Nf1 ablation in neural crest cells would have ultimately
resulted in the development of neurofibromas. However, Nf1flox/−; Krox20-Cre mice do
develop neurofibromas, and Krox20 is not expressed in neural crest cells, which argues that
Nf1 loss in neural crest cells is not required for neurofibroma pathogenesis.

Mouse models in which Nf1 was ablated in Schwann cell precursors (SCPs; also known as
neural crest stem cells) were more informative. For these experiments, 3.9Periostin-Cre
(which is active in SCPs by E11) and P0a-Cre (expressed in SCPs beginning at E12.5) driver
lines were created and bred to Nf1flox/ − mice. While the majority of Nf1flox/−; 3.9Periosin-
Cre animals died by the 4th postnatal week [35] (possibly due to activation of the
3.9Periostin promoter in cardiac fibroblasts [61, 72]), Nf1flox/−; P0a-Cre animals survived
and formed neurofibromas by 15-20 months of age [35, 96]. Curiously, however, SCPs
could not be isolated from the peripheral nerves of adult Nf1flox/−; P0a-Cre mice, and SCPs
from E13 Nf1−/− mice did not generate tumors when transplanted into Nf1+/− sciatic nerves
[35]. Further, the proliferating cells in these neurofibromas were p75+, GFAP+ and BLBP−
[35, 96], suggesting that mature non-myelinating Schwann cells rather than SCPs were the
cell type giving rise to neurofibromas in this model. In keeping with this idea,
hyperproliferative non-myelinating Schwann cells were found in the postnatal sciatic nerves
of Nf1flox/−; P0a-Cre mice prior to neurofibroma development [96].

However, this conclusion was inconsistent with the phenotype of a mouse model in which
the Desert Hedgehog promoter drives Cre-mediated Nf1 ablation in SCPs at E12.5
(Nf1flox/flox; Dhh-Cre mice) [89]. Unlike the tumors arising in Nf1flox/−; P0a-Cre mice,
neurofibromas developing in Nf1flox/flox; Dhh-Cre mice contained numerous BLBP+ cells
[89], suggesting that immature Schwann cells were the progenitors for these tumors.
Interestingly, the development of neurofibromas in Nf1flox/flox; Dhh-Cre mice occurred
despite the presence of a wild-type Nf1 microenvironment; no evidence was found for Cre-
mediated recombination in mast cells, endothelial cells or endoneurial fibroblasts [89],
despite the fact that Dhh-expressing progenitors capable of differentiating into both
Schwann cells and endoneurial fibroblasts have been found in peripheral nerve [36]. Given
these contradictory results, it is not yet clear whether the neoplastic Schwann cells within
plexiform neurofibromas are derived from mature nonmyelinating Schwann cells, immature
Schwann cells or both cell types. The possibility that these neoplastic Schwann cells arise
from another source such as boundary cap cells also has not yet been ruled out.

Given the marked differences in the clinical behavior of dermal and plexiform
neurofibromas, it is possible that the neoplastic cells in these neurofibroma subtypes are
derived from distinct progenitors. Neural-crest derived precursor cells capable of both
Schwannian and melanocytic differentiation, termed skin-derived precursors (SKPs) [46],
are present in the dermis of adult mice. Consistent with the hypothesis that SKPs give rise to
dermal neurofibromas, topical administration of tamoxifen to neonatal Nf1flox/− ; CMV-
CreERT2; Rosa26-LacZ(stop) mice results in dermal neurofibroma formation at the site of

tamoxifen administration [46]. Further, SKPs isolated from these animals and treated ex
vivo with tamoxifen to inactivate Nf1 were also capable of generating neurofibromas upon
autologous subcutaneous transplantion into pregnant mice, indicating that these progenitors
(and not other cell types residing in the dermis) were the cell of origin of the dermal
neurofibromas.

Interestingly, Nf1−/− SKPs were also capable of forming plexiform neurofibromas when
autografted into sciatic nerves (Le 2009). Thus, while SKPs residing in the dermis may be
the cell of origin of dermal neurofibromas, these cells are apparently highly similar to the
neurofibroma-initiating cells in peripheral nerve. Transcriptional profiling does not
distinguish dermal and plexiform neurofibromas [56], which suggests that the distinct
clinical behavior of these tumors primarily reflects differences in their microenvironment
rather than their cell of origin. If this hypothesis is correct, the expansion of dermal
neurofibromas during pregnancy, for example, may be due to hormonally-altered paracrine
signaling from fibroblasts, melanocytes, or other cell types within the dermis feeding back
on the Nf1−/− progenitor cells rather than major differences in the Nf1−/− progenitors
themselves. This is consistent with the fact that pregnancy has a well-established effect on
skin pigmentation and elasticity [77, 84].

However, if the cell of origin for dermal and plexiform neurofibromas is virtually identical
save for their microenvironment niche, why do dermal neurofibromas not arise in the
various Nf1flox/− models discussed above? The experiments described above clearly
demonstrate that mouse dermis is capable of giving rise to neurofibromas, so species-
specific differences in skin susceptibility to neurofibroma formation are unlikely to explain
this phenomenon. Clearly, more work is needed to understand these cells and their true
relationship with the progenitor cells in the peripheral nerve.

3.5 Mouse Models of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Pathogenesis

Although most mouse models of NF1 developed to date have focused on plexiform
neurofibroma pathogenesis, the transformation of these benign tumors into MPNSTs is of
far greater concern to NF1 patients [55], especially given the lack of effective treatment
options for these malignancies. However, modeling MPNST formation in mice has proven
challenging, as the plexiform neurofibromas developing in mice with Nf1 mutations only
rarely progress to become MPNSTs. This may be due in part to the relatively short lifespan
of mice, which could prevent murine Nf1−/− Schwann cells from having adequate time to
accumulate the additional tumor suppressor mutations driving MPNST pathogenesis.
Alternatively, cells that acquire secondary mutations may persist in the latent phase of
malignancy progression until the mice die from other causes.

Consequently, mice with null alleles of both Nf1 and p53 were generated to accelerate this
process. As these genes are both located on mouse chromosome 11, tumorigenesis was
compared in mice with mutant Nf1 and p53 alleles on opposite chromosomes (trans Nf1+/−/
p53+/− mice) and in mice with mutant Nf1 and p53 alleles on the same copy of chromosome
11 (cis-linked Nf1+/−/p53+/− mice). Perhaps not surprisingly, these animals showed
discordant phenotypes. Trans Nf1+/−/p53+/− animals died by 10 months of non-MPNST soft-
tissue sarcoma types typically associated with p53 loss of function. In contrast, 30% of the
cis-linked Nf1+/−/p53+/− animals dying by 5 months of age were found to have MPNSTs
[15]. Interestingly, these MPNSTs did not appear to arise in preexisting plexiform
neurofibromas, suggesting that combined loss of Nf1 and p53 allowed MPNSTs to develop
de novo.

MPNST formation also occurs in mice carrying a mutated Nf1 gene in combination with
other tumor suppressor mutations. In keeping with the observation that CDKN2A is

commonly mutated in human MPNSTs [1, 6, 43, 58, 63, 67], 26% of Nf1+/− mice with
simultaneous homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus (Nf1+/−; p16Ink4a−/−/p19Arf−/−
mice) developed MPNSTs, while those with heterozygous deletions of both loci (Nf1+/−;
p16Ink4a/p19Arf+/− mice) developed MPNSTs at a much lower frequency [35]. As with
MPNSTs arising in cis-linked Nf1+/−/p53+/− animals, the MPNSTs developing in Nf1+/−;
p16Ink4a−/−/p19Arf−/− mice did not appear to arise from a precursor neurofibroma. Neither
Nf1+/−; p19Arf−/− [41] or Nf1+/−; p16Ink4a−/− animals [35] showed a predisposition to
MPNST development, indicating that deletion of both products encoded by the CDKN2A
locus (and thus, dysregulation of both the p53 and pRb pathways) is necessary to promote
MPNST formation in the setting of Nf1 heterozygosity.

The cell-of-origin debate was also revisited in MPNSTs derived from these models, as the
absence of a benign precursor tumor raised the question of whether these malignancies were
derived from a progenitor population distinct from that giving rise to neurofibromas. As at
least some MPNST cells isolated from Nf1+/−; p16Ink4a−/−/p19Arf−/− and cis-linked Nf1+/−/
p53+/− animals can grow as neurospheres capable of self-renewal [35], this work focused on
the Schwann cell precursor stage of Schwannian development. However, SCPs did not show
abnormal persistence or impaired differentiation in these animals and did not form tumors
when transplanted into sciatic nerves. Moreover, MPNST cells from these animals, unlike
SCPs, were not capable of differentiation along multiple lineages [35] and showed decreased
levels of Sox10, a HMG-box factor critically important for maintaining the ability of
precursor cells to give rise to glia and neurons [40].

Reduced Sox10 expression is also evident in human MPNSTs [47, 56, 57], together with a
general downregulation of genes important for Schwannian differentiation [56]. At the same
time, MPNSTs upregulate the expression of molecules characteristic of migrating neural
crest cells such as Sox9 and Twist1 [56, 57]. In contrast, neurofibromas express a gene
signature more characteristic of Schwann cell precursors or immature Schwann cells [56].
As human NF1-associated MPNSTs develop via malignant progression from neurofibromas,
it is unlikely these differences in gene expression are due to neurofibromas and MPNSTs
arising from distinct cell populations. Consequently, loss or suppression of Schwannian
differentiation signals is apparently an important step in the progression to MPNSTs.

3.6 Neurofibroma and MPNST Formation in Conditional Ras Activation Mutants

As noted above, one of the best understood functions of neurofibromin is its ability to
negatively regulate Ras action. What is not as widely appreciated is that neurofibromin
regulates the activity of multiple Ras proteins from both the classic Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-
Ras) and R-Ras (R-Ras, R-Ras2/TC21, R-Ras3/M-Ras) families of small G-proteins.
Further, it has not yet been established which Ras isoforms are expressed in neoplastic
Schwann cells within human neurofibromas or MPNSTs or which of these molecules are
critically important for tumorigenesis. However, mouse models in which constitutively
active mutants of N-Ras or K-Ras are expressed in the Schwann cell lineage have been
constructed for the purpose of determining whether this results in neurofibroma and/or
MPNST pathogenesis.

Interestingly, distinct phenotypes were observed when activated N-Ras and K-Ras were
expressed in the Schwann cell lineage. Mice expressing activated N-Ras in neural-crest
derived cells (LSLNrasG12V/+; CAMK2-Cre) developed diffuse dermal neurofibromas [68]
and hyperpigmented skin lesions similar to café-au-lait macules. Curiously, these skin
lesions showed enhanced accumulation of pigment in melanocytes and large numbers of
pigment-laden macrophages rather than an increase in melanocyte numbers [68], suggesting
that pigment production rather than melanocyte proliferation was promoted by activated N-
Ras. No plexiform neurofibromas or MPNSTs were observed in these animals.

In contrast, LSLKras2BG12D/+; mGFAP-Cre mice did not develop tumors on a wild-type
background. However, when bred onto a Ptenflox/+ background, they all developed multiple
plexiform neurofibromas by 4 months of age [28]. Interestingly, neurofibroma progression
to MPNSTs, which was associated with loss of the remaining functional Pten allele, also
occurred in all animals by 7 months. This pattern of tumor incidence was not evident in
Nf1flox/+ Ptenflox/+; mGFAP-Cre mice, likely due to a requirement for LOH for both Nf1
and Pten in the same cell; as these genes are located on separate mouse chromosomes, this is
probably a highly uncommon event. Considered together, these findings suggest a role for
PTEN in MPNST progression, consistent with previous reports that PTEN deletion [30] or
silencing by promoter methylation [37] is present in a subset of human MPNST samples.

So why does activation of N-Ras induce dermal neurofibroma formation directly, while
plexiform neurofibroma generation in K-Ras2B-activated cells requires concomitant PTEN
haploinsufficiency? One possible explanation is the Cre-driver lines used. CAMK2-Cre
mediates recombination in cells derived from the neural crest [68]. Consequently, CAMK2-
Cre will activate expression of the mutated Ras allele earlier in development and in more
cell types than will the mGFAP-Cre driver, which is not active until the immature Schwann
cell stage [28]. This would increase the pool of cells capable of transformation, leading to
more frequent development of neurofibromas in CAMK2-Cre mice. Alternatively, cells at
different stages in Schwannian development may differentially regulate the signaling
pathways that are affected in these models. PTEN is a negative regulator of class I
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling [51], a pro-survival cascade which can be
activated by GTP-bound Ras [42, 65, 66, 80, 90]. In many cell types, transformation by
oncogenic Ras requires coordinate activation of PI3K and other Ras effectors such as Raf
and RalGDS [53, 83]. However, it is possible that Ras-induced transformation requires
unrestrained PI3K activation in immature Schwann cells but not in neural crest cells and
their immediate derivatives. Alternatively, cells at earlier developmental stages may
downregulate PTEN, leading to heightened Ras-induced PI3K activation without the need
for additional mutations. Finally, intrinsic differences in the ability of oncogenic K-Ras and
N-Ras mutants to activate the PI3K pathway may also be responsible for the differential
requirement for PTEN haploinsufficiency in these models. Although N-Ras and K-Ras
activate PI3K signaling with approximately equal magnitude when overexpressed [29, 48,
65], studies with Ras molecules expressed at physiological levels indicate that K-Ras but not
N-Ras is the major mediator of PI3K activation downstream of growth factors [49] and
cytokines [95].

3.7 Manifestations of NF1 in Dysregulated Growth Factor Signaling Models

As noted above, when neurofibromin is lost in neoplastic Schwann cells, the rate of Ras
inactivation is dramatically reduced, leading to accumulation of activated Ras. However,
this begs the question of precisely what activates these Ras proteins in the first place. One
likely possibility is that aberrant growth factor signaling performs this function in neoplastic
Schwann cells. Indeed, aberrant expression of several growth factors and growth factor
receptors has been identified in human neurofibromas and MPNSTs [11]. However, this
hypothesis has been tested in transgenic mouse models only for the EGF receptor (EGFR,
erbB1), the prototype of the erbB family of membrane tyrosine kinase receptors, and
neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a growth factor that activates the other three members of the erbB
kinase family (erbB2, erbB3, erbB4). Interestingly, these mouse models produced quite
different outcomes.

A chemical carcinogenesis model of MPNST formation provided the first evidence
implicating the erbB kinases in PNS tumor formation. Beginning more than four decades
ago, investigators noted that rats [23, 34], mice [2] and hamsters [10, 22] exposed in utero to
the chemical carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU) developed peripheral nerve sheath

tumors that satisfy modern diagnostic criteria for MPNSTs. These tumors frequently carried
activating mutations of the ErbB2 (HER2, c-neu) membrane tyrosine kinase [59, 60].
Although erbB2 does not directly bind growth factors, it is the preferred heterodimerization
partner for the other erbB receptors [27, 78] and facilitates ErbB heterodimer signal
transduction [71]; mutated erbB2 can also homodimerize [69, 86, 87]. Thus, ErbB2
activation could trigger MPNST formation by dysregulating signaling pathways downstream
of erbB2 homodimers, downstream of EGF or NRG1 or all three. The potential importance
of the observations in these rodent models was reinforced by the subsequent demonstration
that amplification of ErbB2 [75] and EGFR [62, 63] occurs in at least some human
MPNSTs.

To examine the impact of neuregulin signaling on PNS tumorigenesis, a transgenic mouse
model was produced in which expression of the secreted NRG1 isoform GGFβ3 was
directed by the Schwann cell-specific myelin protein zero (P0) promoter [31]. These animals
developed Schwann cell hyperplasia that was evident by 1 month of age, followed by
neurofibroma formation (unpublished observations) which progressed to MPNSTs by 6-10
months of age [31]. Importantly, this is one of only two reported transgenic models in which
neurofibromas frequently progress to MPNSTs. Further, this malignant progression is
associated with the mutation of additional tumor suppressor genes as is observed in human
MPNSTs (unpublished data). Supporting the relevance of NRG signaling to human NF1-
associated neurofibromas and MPNSTs, human neurofibromas, MPNSTs and MPNST cell
lines express ErbB2, ErbB3, and/or ErbB4 together with multiple NRG-1 isoforms [74]. The
erbB receptors expressed in these MPNST cell lines are constitutively activated and MPNST
mitogenesis is profoundly inhibited by the pan-ErbB inhibitor PD168393 [74]. Further,
stimulation of human MPNST cells with NRG-1β increases the migration and invasion of
these cells [24].

The role of EGF receptor signaling in NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors has
also been examined. EGFR is aberrantly expressed in many human neurofibromas and
MPNSTs as shown by the fact that this molecule is not found in normal neonatal Schwann
cells [21, 25]. In addition, the EGFR gene is amplified in a subset of human MPNSTs [62,
63] and EGF stimulation of serum-starved MPNST cells enhances their growth and survival
[21]. To examine the contribution of this membrane tyrosine kinase to PNS tumorigenesis,
transgenic mice were produced which over-expressed human EGFR in Schwann cells under
the control of the CNPase promoter (CNP-hEGFR mice). These animals developed a
hyperproliferative nerve phenotype with evidence of mast cell accumulation and fibrosis
[50]. However, frank neurofibroma formation was exceedingly rare in these mice and was
only observed at a very advanced age. Crossing CNP-hEGFR mice to Nf1+/− animals did
not worsen the phenotype. However, Nf1+/−p53+/− mice did show enhanced survival on an
EGFRwa-2 (EGFR hypomorphic mutation) background as compared to a wild-type
background. As these animals develop many malignancies other than MPNSTs, it was
unclear whether this increase in survival was due to a decrease in MPNST incidence or
inhibition of the development of other tumor types that occur in these animals [50].

So why would NRG1 but not EGFR over-expression cause neurofibroma and MPNST
formation? One possibility is that secreted NRG1 may affect multiple cell types within the
peripheral nerve, potentially invoking paracrine signaling analogous to that occurring in
human neurofibromas, while EGFR over-expression has action that is limited to Schwann
cells. Another possibility is that EGFR expression is primarily required for tumor
progression rather than promoting the initial formation of neurofibromas. Finally, it is
possible that different signaling pathways are activated downstream of the NRG1 and EGF
receptors, allowing the former but not the latter to mimic Nf1 loss.

4. Summary

Page 12

The findings from the mouse models described above together with observations from
human tumors suggest that neurofibroma pathogenesis and subsequent progression to
become MPNSTs results from the accumulation of a series of molecular abnormalities (Fig.
7). In this scenario, the initial step in neurofibroma pathogenesis is loss of the remaining
functional NF1 allele in a Schwann cell. It is likely that Ras surveillance mechanisms as
well as additional tumor suppressors such as p53, p16INK4a, p19Arf, and pRb at least
transiently maintain the NF1−/− Schwann cell in a quiescent state, a suggestion which is
consistent with the previous demonstration that senescent regions are present in
neurofibromas [16]. Eventually, however, some unknown factor or confluence of factors
stimulates a brief hyperproliferative period that is associated with paracrine recruitment of
NF1+/− mast cells and fibroblasts. Paracrine signaling during this period may also facilitate
inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins noted above via mechanisms that promote
cellular growth in untransformed cells. As this would probably occur in individual cells or in
small regions of the benign tumor, tumor expansion could still occur regionally while the
bulk of the tumor was maintained in a growth arrested state. Loss or mutation of tumor
suppressor genes such as p53, CDKN2A and Pten would allow the neoplastic Schwann cells
to stably evade this senescence response, resulting in progression to MPNSTs. At this point,
paracrine signaling would no longer be required to support the growth of the tumor,
resulting in gradual overgrowth of the malignant cells until the untransformed mast cells and
fibroblasts were no longer evident in the growing mass.

Although this scenario is consistent with the findings described in this review, it is clear that
several key steps in this process remain poorly understood. Understanding these steps will
require that we answer many questions such as how exactly how senescence fail-safes are
evaded in neoplastic Schwann cells, what paracrine signaling molecules facilitate
neurofibroma pathogenesis, what roles these paracrine signaling molecules play in this
process and what additional mutations are responsible for neurofibroma-MPNST
progression. Given the insights they have yielded thus far, new genetically engineered
mouse models will undoubtedly play an important role in our efforts to answer these
questions.

Fig. 2. Photomicrographs demonstrating the presence of multiple cell types in neurofibromas
Unlike other types of peripheral nerve sheath tumors, neurofibromas are composed of a
complex mixture of multiple cell types normally present in peripheral nerve. (A)

loosely packed collection of spindled cells characteristic of these tumors. (B) Immunostains
for S100β label the cytoplasm and nuclei of Schwann cell-like elements within a plexiform
neurofibroma. (C) Axons, which are visualized here by their immunoreactivity for
neurofilaments, are separated by neoplastic Schwann cells and other cellular elements
recruited into the tumor. This demonstrates the infiltrative nature of these lesions. (D)
Numerous mast cells, identifiable by their immunoreactivity for CD117 (c-Kit), are also
present in this plexiform neurofibroma. Scale bars, 50 μm.

highlighted by their S100β immunoreactivity. (C) In contrast, this schwannoma resected
from the VIIIth cranial nerve of an NF2 patient shows a lower degree of cellularity and
relatively uniform “cigar-shaped” tumor cell nuclei. (D) Hematoxylin and eosin stained
section of a melanotic schwannoma, a tumor type associated with Carney complex. Note the

cells and other NF1 haploinsufficient cell types intrinsic to peripheral nerve
Established interactions are depicted with solid black arrows and font, while potential
interactions are depicted with gray dashed arrows labeled with question marks. Established
interactions include the elevated secretion of Kit ligand from NF1+/− Schwann cells, which
is further increased upon loss of the remaining NF1 allele and which acts as a
chemoattractant and activating factor for NF1+/− mast cells. Activated NF1+/− mast cells
have also been shown to secrete elevated levels of TGFβ, which stimulates increased
collagen deposition from NF1+/− fibroblasts.

Fig. 6. Schwann cell development
Neural crest cells give rise to a series of cell types in the Schwann cell lineage, one or more
of which can become a neurofibroma initiating cell (NIC) following biallelic NF1 loss.
Plexiform NICs are thought to be derived from Schwann cell precursors or their more
differentiated progeny in deep peripheral nerves; alternative origins such as boundary cap
cell or satellite cells have also been proposed. Another progenitor population arising from
the neural crest has been located in the dermis, and dermal NICs may arise instead from
these skin-derived precursors (SKPs) or their progeny. Times indicated are the embryonic
days (E) at which specific Schwann cell precursors appear in the mouse. Listed below each
cell type are useful markers of specific developmental stages and promoters which are active
at these stages (see text for further discussion). Note that promoters used to drive Cre-
mediated recombination are often fragments of whole gene promoters and may have a

Fig. 7. Major events in the pathogenesis of a neurofibroma and its subsequent progression to
become a MPNST
Illustrated are the changes leading to neurofibroma and MPNST development in GEM
models of NF1. Transient hyperplasia is often observed in the peripheral nerves of these
animals prior to neurofibroma development; it is unclear whether an Nf1+/− background is
sufficient to generate this phenotype or whether biallelic loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells must
also occur. Neurofibroma development, however, does depend upon biallelic loss of Nf1 in
Schwann cells or their less differentiated precursors. Loss of the remaining functional Nf1
allele in the Schwann cell lineage triggers elaboration of paracrine signaling molecules that
recruit other Nf1+/− cell types (including mast cells, fibroblasts, and other Schwann cells)
from the peripheral nerve to the nascent tumor site. As not all Nf1−/− Schwann cells generate
neurofibromas, there are likely other as-yet-undetermined events that must occur to the
Nf1−/− Schwann cell or its microenvironment to trigger tumor formation. Once the
neurofibroma has been established, additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as
TP53 and p16Ink4a/p19Arf in Nf1−/− Schwann cells drive malignant progression.
Comparisons with human neurofibromas and MPNSTs indicate that most of these events are
relevant to the pathogenesis of the human counterparts of these murine tumors. However,
the relevance of some changes seen in the murine tumor models (e.g., the initial phase of
intraneural hyperplasia) remains to be determined. It should also be noted that other events
associated with malignant progression in human MPNSTs (e.g., suppression of Sox10
expression and upregulation of Sox9 expression, altered epigenetic modification or miRNA
regulation programs) have not yet been thoroughly explored in genetically engineered
mouse models of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
