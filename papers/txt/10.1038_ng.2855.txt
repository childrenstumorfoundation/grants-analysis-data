Constitutional	SMARCB1	mutations	at	22q11.23	have	
been	found	in	~50%	of	familial	and	<10%	of	sporadic	
schwannomatosis	cases1.	We	sequenced	highly	conserved	
regions	along	22q	from	eight	individuals	with	schwannomatosis	
whose	schwannomas	involved	somatic	loss	of	one	copy	of	22q,	
encompassing	SMARCB1	and	NF2,	with	a	different	somatic	
mutation	of	the	other	NF2	allele	in	every	schwannoma	but	
no	mutation	of	the	remaining	SMARCB1	allele	in	blood	and	
tumor	samples.	LZTR1	germline	mutations	were	identified	in	
seven	of	the	eight	cases.	LZTR1	sequencing	in	12	further	cases	
with	the	same	molecular	signature	identified	9	additional	
germline	mutations.	Loss	of	heterozygosity	with	retention	of	an	
LZTR1	mutation	was	present	in	all	25	schwannomas	studied.	
Mutations	segregated	with	disease	in	all	available	affected	
first-degree	relatives,	although	four	asymptomatic	parents	
also	carried	an	LZTR1	mutation.	Our	findings	identify	LZTR1	
as	a	gene	predisposing	to	an	autosomal	dominant	inherited	
disorder	of	multiple	schwannomas	in	~80%	of	22q-related	
schwannomatosis	cases	lacking	mutation	in	SMARCB1.

Schwannomatosis  (MIM  162091),  the  third  major  form  of  neuro­
fibromatosis,  is  a  late­onset  tumor  predisposition  disorder  that  is 
clinically  and  genetically  distinct  from  neurofibromatosis  types  1  
(MIM 162200) and 2 (MIM 101000). Although isolated schwanno­
mas are common benign tumors, schwannomatosis—characterized by  
the development of multiple schwannomas without the bilateral ves­
tibular schwannomas, congenital cataracts or ependymomas typically 

associated with neurofibromatosis type 2—is rare; however, its exact 
incidence is unknown2,3. While constitutional NF2 mutations are not 
found, independent somatic mutations affecting both NF2 alleles are 
typically present in every schwannoma of individuals with schwanno­
matosis4. Multipoint linkage analysis in families with schwannomatosis 
pointed to an ~8.48­Mb region centromeric to the NF2 locus, between 
markers  D22S420  and  D22S1148,  as  the  linked  region5.  Germline  
mutations in SMARCB1, located in this region and previously known to 
cause rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS), have since been 
found in schwannomatosis cases2,6–10. Genetic analysis of schwannomas 
in cases with a SMARCB1 germline mutation (first event, E1) shows loss 
of a region at 22q (second event, E2), with retention of the SMARCB1 
mutation in the schwannomas, followed by mutation of the remaining 
wild­type NF2 gene (third event, E3) in cis with the SMARCB1 germline  
mutation2,7.  These  three  events  result  in  biallelic  loss  of  both  the 
SMARCB1 and NF2 tumor suppressor genes in the schwannomas.

As  germline  SMARCB1  mutations  account  for  only  ~50%  of 
familial and <10% of sporadic cases11, additional schwannomatosis­ 
 predisposing loci probably exist. A subset of cases had no constitu­
tional first­hit SMARCB1 mutation but had deletion of part of 22q 
encompassing both NF2 and SMARCB1 and somatic mutation of 
the remaining NF2 allele in the schwannomas (Online Methods and 
Supplementary Fig. 1). We hypothesized that either functionally 
important sequences outside of the SMARCB1 regions previously 
analyzed through clinical testing (for example, introns, 5′ or 3′ UTRs 
or  intergenic  regions)  or  an  alternative  evolutionarily  conserved 
locus  on  chromosome  22  might  carry  a  first  hit  predisposing  to

pathogenic mutation affecting the highly evolutionarily conserved CTT nucleotide motif within the splice acceptor of exon 19: phastCons score of 1.00 and phyloP score for the consecutive nucleotides of 2.87, 
2.95 and 2.14. fThe c.594–3C>T transition is annotated in ESP but is predicted not to affect splicing, whereas the c.594–3C>G transversion has not previously been reported. c.594–3C>G is predicted to create 
a novel splice acceptor sequence and to decrease the strength of the wild-type splice acceptor site, and it was proven in this study to cause aberrant splicing (skipping of exon 7) at the mRNA (cDNA) level. 
gc.2348C>T is a SNP (rs143507674) at chr. 22: 21,351,197 in dbSNP137; however, no pathogenic c.2348_2351delCGCA is present in dbSNP137 or ESP.

 schwannomatosis in these cases. Here we report studies of germ­
line DNA in 20 unrelated probands (6 familial cases, 11 sporadic 
cases and 3 cases with unknown family history of schwannomatosis;  
Supplementary  Table  1)  with  an  unknown  first­hit  mutation  in 
blood  and  schwannomas  (E1?),  loss  of  22q  (E2+)  and  a  different 
NF2 mutation in every schwannoma (E3+) (Supplementary Fig. 1).  
We selectively enriched for 3.72 Mb of highly conserved sequence 
along chromosome 22 and initially performed deep parallel sequenc­
ing in eight cases (NGS1–NGS8) (Table 1 and Online Methods).

Variants were called with Platypus and SVDetect12, which, in addition 
to identifying germline mutations, includes a search for mosaic and struc­
tural variants. Initial filtering identified a single gene, LZTR1, carrying 
previously unreported exonic nonsynonymous variants in four of eight 
cases (Supplementary Table 2); these variants encoded p.Ser122Leu, 
p.Val456Gly, p.Pro520Leu and p.Arg688Cys alterations, all of which 
are missense changes affecting highly conserved amino acids and are 

 predicted in silico to be damaging (Figs. 1 and 2, Table 1, Supplementary 
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4a). Manual examination of 
intronic LZTR1 sequences identified mutations affecting conserved 
splice sites in three additional probands of this initial cohort; these 
mutations included c.264–13G>A, c.1449+1G>A and c.2220–16_2220–
14delCTT (Supplementary Fig. 3). All mutations were confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing. Analysis of discrepancies in insert size and anomalies  
in mapping information did not identify likely pathogenic intrachromo­
somal changes (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 5).

Sanger sequencing of LZTR1 in lymphocyte DNA from 12 fur­
ther unrelated E1?E2+E3+ probands (S1–S12) identified additional 
mutations in 9 cases (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In total, 15 different previ­
ously unreported germline mutations in LZTR1 were found in 16 
of 20 unrelated schwannomatosis probands negative for SMARCB1 
mutation (E1?E2+E3+) but in 0 of 8 schwannomatosis probands pos­
itive for SMARCB1 mutation (E1+E2+E3+) (P = 0.0002, two­tailed

Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary Table 6), including 6 truncating 
mutations (4 frameshift and 2 out­of­frame splice­site mutations), 
1 in­frame splice­site mutation, a 3­nt deletion affecting a highly 
evolutionarily conserved splice acceptor sequence and 7 different 
missense  mutations  predicted  to  be  damaging,  all  of  which  were 
absent in dbSNP137, the 1000 Genomes Project and ESP6500 (Fig. 1,  
Table 1, Supplementary Figs. 2–4 and Supplementary Table 4). 
The spectrum of mutations suggests that loss of function is the main 
mechanism. LZTR1, located at 22q11.21, contains 21 exons and gener­
ates multiple alternatively spliced transcripts, with the longest ORF 

encoding an 840­residue protein13. LZTR1 is expressed ubiquitously 
and abundantly in human tissues13,14. LZTR1 resides centromeric to 
SMARCB1, also within the previously identified schwannomatosis­
associated linkage interval5. Loss of heterozygosity with retention of 
the case­specific LZTR1 mutation was found in all 25 schwannomas 
studied, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the LZTR1 mutations 
are pathogenic (the likelihood of such genetic changes occurring by 
chance in all 25 tumors in 16 unrelated cases is conservatively ~1.5 ×  
10−5) and consistent with a tumor suppressor mode of action for LZTR1 
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5). The LZTR1 mutations segregated

Figure 3  Pedigrees of families positive 
for LZTR1 mutation with information from 
relatives available for testing. Filled symbols 
represent individuals clinically affected by 
schwannomatosis. Open symbols with a 
vertical line represent clinically asymptomatic, 
(likely) non-penetrant individuals carrying the 
familial LZTR1 mutation. Plus and minus signs 
indicate individuals positive or negative for the 
family-specific mutation, respectively. LZTR1 
mutation in probands (arrows) was initially 
identified by next-generation sequencing of 
evolutionarily conserved sequences at 22q 
(NGS2, NGS3, NGS5, NGS7) or by sequencing 
the entire coding sequence of the LZTR1 gene 
and flanking intronic sequences (S1, S3, S6, 
S7, S9). Relatives were subjected to targeted 
analysis of the family-specific LZTR1 mutation

with the presence of multiple schwannomas 
in all seven affected first­degree relatives from 
five families, in line with autosomal domi­
nant inheritance (Fig. 3). A germline LZTR1 
mutation was identified in all familial cases 
studied and in 8 of 11 reportedly sporadic 
cases.  No  first­hit  LZTR1  mutations  were 
detected in the schwannomas of the remain­
ing three sporadic cases; therefore, LZTR1 
mosaicism is unlikely to explain the phenotype of these individuals 
(Supplementary Table 6).

S6 (+)

The clinically unaffected fathers of four reportedly sporadic cases 
carried the familial LZTR1 mutation (Fig. 3), probably demonstrat­
ing non­penetrance, which has previously been observed in familial 
schwannomatosis pedigrees9. As these individuals did not undergo full­
body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they may carry unrecognized 
tumors. It is possible that LZTR1 mutations predispose to a phenotype 
at the mild end of the spectrum (even resulting in a single schwannoma, 
which is a common finding in the general population) with incomplete 
penetrance; larger studies including more affected individuals and their 
unaffected relatives will help resolve this question.

LZTR1  was  recently  characterized  as  a  tumor  suppressor  gene 
and driver in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) on the basis of the 
presence of biallelic mutations in 4 of 139 GBM samples, with muta­
tions driving self­renewal and growth of glioma spheres15. Moreover, 
somatic LZTR1 mutations have been identified in several cancers 
(Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database) 
(Supplementary Table 4b). However, some loss­of­function muta­
tions in LZTR1 have also been found in control populations (ESP2500 
and the 1000 Genomes Project), a feature shared with some other 
tumor  suppressor  genes  involved  in  hereditary  predisposition  to 
late­onset disorders, including MSH6, PMS2, BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
All these genes have a complex spectrum of mutations associated with 
variable expressivity and penetrance16–18, and, for BRCA2, MSH6 and 
PMS2, biallelic mutations have been found in rare individuals with 
distinct phenotypes19. Penetrance for associated tumors may be dif­
ferent for a given gene and even may be different depending on the 
specific mutation.

We performed a detailed analysis of the spectrum and frequency 
of LZTR1 mutations in tumor databases (schwannomatosis, GBM 
and the confirmed somatic cohort in COSMIC) versus control data­
bases (ESP2500 and the 1000 Genomes Project) (Supplementary 
Figs. 6 and 7 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The frequencies  

of predicted pathogenic mutations in LZTR1 in cases from the present 
study (16/20) and controls (27/3,292) were extremely statistically dif­
ferent (P < 0.0001; 2­tailed Fisher’s exact test). In addition, the differ­
ence in the predicted pathogenicity of observed missense mutations 
in the tumor databases (schwannomatosis, GBM and the confirmed 
somatic cohort of COSMIC) and control databases was also very sta­
tistically significant. The frequency of different/non­recurrent pre­
dicted damaging missense mutations in the tumor­associated cohorts 
(25/35) versus control populations (12/34) was also very statistically 
significant (P = 0.0037, 2­tailed Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary 
Fig. 6). None of the mutations in the tumor databases were present 
in  the  control  databases,  except  for  the  mutation  encoding  a 
p.Phe447Leu alteration from COSMIC, which was predicted to be 
probably benign. Of the 35 different missense mutations reported in 
the tumor­associated data sets, 10 were found in >1 unrelated tumor 
sample or were affecting a critical amino acid (Arg68) observed to be 
targeted by different codon­changing mutations, implying functional 
significance. Nevertheless, the available data from control cohorts 
suggest that pathogenic mutations in the LZTR1 tumor suppressor 
gene are observed in presumably asymptomatic cases, and further 
studies in individuals heterozygous or compound heterozygous for 
such mutations will allow a better understanding of the spectrum of 
phenotypes associated with mutations in this gene.

The LZTR1 protein belongs to a functionally diverse superfamily of 
BTB/POZ (bric­a­brac, tramtrack and broad complex/pox virus and 
zinc­finger) proteins20. The LZTR1 domain arrangement is unique 
compared to all other known BBK proteins (N­BTB­BACK (BTB and 
C­terminal  Kelch)­Kelch­C)21  and  contains  an  N­terminal  Kelch 
domain with six Kelch motifs followed by two BTB domains (Fig. 2). 
Following each BTB domain, a partial BACK domain (N­Kelch­BTB­
BACK(p)­BTB­BACK(p)­C) is predicted (Supplementary Fig. 8)22, 
which may be important to position the Kelch domains for substrate 
recognition23. All seven missense mutations and the in­frame splice­
site mutation c.1449+1G>A (encoding p.Glu453_Lys484del) affect

highly evolutionarily conserved residues within functional domains 
of importance and are therefore predicted to be pathogenic (Figs. 1 
and 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 8–11).

BTB­containing proteins control fundamental cellular processes, 
ranging from the regulation of chromatin conformation to the cell 
cycle. Alterations in their activities have been linked to many inher­
ited diseases and cancers (Supplementary Fig. 9)24,25. They share a 
role as substrate adaptors for cullin­3 (Cul3) RING ligase (CRL3), 
which recruits substrate­specific adaptors to catalyze protein ubiqui­
tination20. Kelch domains are the most common substrate recognition 
domains for Cul3 (ref. 26). A mass spectroscopy study inferred an 
association of LZTR1 and Cul3 (ref. 27), which was recently proven 
by immunoprecipitation to specifically involve the BTB domain, as 
expected15.  LZTR1  localizes  to  the  Golgi  network  in  endothelial, 
smooth muscle and HeLa cell lines, with this localization mediated 
by LZTR1–BTB­II (ref. 21), and it may stabilize the Golgi complex via 
interaction with other proteins21,28. Other roles for both BTB domains 
need further study.

LZTR1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which may 
facilitate its transport to the nucleus, as shown for another BBK family 
member localized at the Golgi in non­dividing cells and translocated 
to  the  spindle  apparatus  during  mitosis29  (Online  Methods  and 
Supplementary Fig. 12).

Several  proteins  containing  BTB/POZ  domains  interact  with 
the  N­CoR  (nuclear  receptor  corepressors)  and  SMRT  (silencing 
mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) nuclear receptor core­
pressors30,31.  The  N­CoR  complex  also  contains  components  of 
the SWI/SNF chromatin­remodeling complex, and SMARCB1 was 
previously  proven  to  interact  with  N­CoR,  indicating  a  potential 
functional link between LZTR1 and SMARCB1 or other members 
of the SWI/SNF complex32. Moreover, studies in the evolutionarily 
distant organism Toxoplasma gondii have shown that the Toxoplasma 
homolog of LZTR1 interacts with SRCAP33, another member of the  
SWI/SNF complex.

SMARCB1 was previously shown to interact with HDAC4 (histone 
deacetylase 4)34, and mammalian two­hybrid analysis has recently 
shown that LZTR1 also interacts with HDAC4 (ref. 35). Furthermore, 
LZTR1 physically associates with STAT1 (signal transducer and activator  
of transcription 1) and PARP1 (poly (ADP­ribose) polymerase 1)35,  
both  of  which,  through  binding  to  the  SMARCB1  promoter,  are 
involved  in  the  upstream  regulation  of  SMARCB1  (refs.  36,37). 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are emerging as a new class of anti­
tumor drugs, and AR42, a novel compound with HDAC inhibitor 
activity, was recently shown to inhibit growth in schwannoma and 
meningioma cells, offering the prospect of its further evaluation as a 
potential treatment in schwannomatosis38.

Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to unravel the pre­
dicted tissue­specific functions of the different LZTR1 isoforms, their 
cellular localization and the proteins with which they interact in order 
to understand the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of 
schwannomas and other tumors. In conclusion, we report the dis­
covery of germline LZTR1 mutations whose frequency in individuals  
with  schwannomatosis  versus  controls,  retention  in  all  studied 
schwannomas, segregation within affected families and predicted 
effects on protein function provide robust evidence that they are dis­
ease predisposing.

Cases and clinical data. All probands were diagnosed with either sporadic or 
familial schwannomatosis on the basis of diagnostic guidelines and were previ­
ously referred for genetic testing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Medical Genomics Laboratory. The cohort of 20 probands studied here is a 
subpopulation of all schwannomatosis cases referred for genetic testing.

Through comprehensive mutational analyses of NF2, SMARCB1 and copy 
number changes at 22q in schwannomas and blood from schwannomatosis 
cases, we have identified five main groups of affected individuals:

(1)  E1+E2+E3+:  cases  carrying  a  SMARCB1  first­hit  mutation  in  blood 
and schwannomas (positive (+) for mutational event 1, E1+), with loss 
of  22q  (encompassing  the  region  between  and  including  LZTR1  and 
CABP7) in the schwannomas (E2+) and a different NF2 mutation in each  
schwannoma (E3+), resulting in biallelic loss of SMARCB1 and NF2.

(2)  E1?E2+E3+:  cases  with  no  SMARCB1  first­hit  mutation  detectable  in 
blood and schwannomas, although they still have loss of a region at 22q 
(encompassing the region between and including LZTR1 and CABP7) in 
the schwannomas and a different NF2 mutation in each schwannoma. 
In the schwannomas both positive and negative for SMARCB1 mutation 
with loss of 22q and a different NF2 mutation in each schwannoma, the 
eventual (ultimate) target was inactivation of both NF2 copies. It is pos­
sible that the undetected first­hit mutations affect functionally important 
sequences outside the SMARCB1 coding region, such as the 5′ or 3′ UTR 
or a conserved intronic or intergenic region (that may not typically be 
part of the clinical testing that focuses on sequencing of the exons and 
their flanking intron sequence as well as on copy number analysis) or 
that an alternative gene on chromosome 22 carries the first predisposing 
hit (first event, first hit) in these cases.

(3)  E1?E2+E3?:  cases  with  no  SMARCB1  first­hit  mutation  detectable  in 
blood and schwannomas, although they still have loss of a region at 22q 
(encompassing SMARCB1 and NF2) in the schwannomas but no muta­
tions identified in the NF2 gene.

(4)  E1?E2−E3?:  cases  with  no  SMARCB1  first­hit  mutation  detectable  in 
blood and schwannomas, no loss at 22q and no identified NF2 muta­
tions.  This  group  of  cases  may  be  a  heterogeneous  population,  where 
the  underlying  genetic  cause  may  be  diverse  and  is  more  likely  to  be   
unrelated to chromosome 22.

(5)  Some cases were additionally identified as being mosaic NF2 mutation  
carriers,  with  the  presence  of  a  common  first­hit  NF2  mutation  in   
their  schwannomas  (see  the  cautionary  note  on  diagnostic  criteria  in 
Plotkin  et  al.2).  In  addition,  for  some  cases,  only  blood  was  available   
for  testing,  and  no  germline  SMARCB1  or  NF2  mutation  was 
detected;  therefore,  genetic  analysis  did  not  allow  us  to  molecularly   
confirm suspected diagnosis.

All 20 probands in the current study had previously undergone clinical 
genetic testing for SMARCB1 and NF2 mutations at the University of Alabama 
at  Birmingham  Medical  Genomics  Laboratory  on  blood  and  tumor  sam­
ples and belonged to group 2 (E1?E2+E3+). The study was approved by the 
institutional review board at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and 
informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Clinical data are summa­
rized in Supplementary Table 1. Mutational data are summarized in Figure 1,  
Table 1, Supplementary Figures 1 and 13, and Supplementary Table 7.

Targeted resequencing of chromosome 22. A custom SureSelect target enrich­
ment library (design ID 0371891) was designed using the SureDesign online 
tool (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, the custom enrichment library targeted 
exonic and noncoding evolutionarily conserved elements (conserved in verte­
brates with PhastCons scores of >0.85) within previously defined linkage inter­
vals as well as other conserved regions along 22q. The library also included the 
entire repeat­masked genomic sequence of the SMARCB1, NF2 and CABIN1 
genes, previously implied (SMARCB1 and NF2) or suggested (CABIN1) to be 
important in schwannomatosis39–42. In total, the library covered 3.72 Mb of 
genomic reference sequence along 22q. Target capture was carried out accord­
ing  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol  (Agilent  Technologies).  Samples  were 
subjected to paired­end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. 

Corresponding  data  files  have  been  deposited  in  ArrayExpress  (accession  
E­MTAB­1574). Sequencing statistics are provided in Supplementary Table 2. 
Sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using the 
Burrows­Wheeler transform Aligner (BWA)43. Unmapped reads and reads with 
mapping quality of <30 (Phred scaled) were removed using SAMtools44.

Detection  and  annotation  of  sequence  variants.  Variant  detection  was 
carried out with Platypus (accessed March 2012) in variant­calling mode. 
Variants supported by high­quality bases (≥30) in fewer than five reads were 
filtered out. Variants called by Platypus were further annotated with SeattleSeq 
134 (accessed August 2012), including allele counts from dbSNP134 and the 
ESP Exome Variant Server (v.0.0.14; released June 2012), and were filtered 
according to predicted effect using the in­house tool VCF File Comparator  
(P.M., L.M.M. and A.P., unpublished data).

Structural variant analysis. Sorted and indexed BAM files were preprocessed 
with the BAM_preprocessingPairs.pl script from SVDetect r.0.8 (ref. 12). This 
script filters out correctly mapped reads and outputs anomalously mapped 
reads for downstream analysis. SVDetect was run on the output files with the 
following parameters: sliding window size for partitioning the genome for 
intrachromosomal rearrangements, µ + 2σ (where µ is the mean of the insert 
size distribution and σ is the standard error of the insert size distribution); 
length of the sliding window step, one­fourth of the window size; minimum 
number of pairs in a cluster, one­fourth of the median depth of coverage for 
the experiment; minimum number of σ­fold for insert size filtering and to call 
insertions, deletions or tandem duplications, 3; minimal final filtering score 
for calling structural variants, 0.8.

cDNA-based mutation analysis. cDNA­based analysis of the SMARCB1, NF2 and 
LZTR1 genes began with RNA extraction from a phytohemagglutinin­stimulated 
short­term  lymphocyte  culture  (STLC)  and  RT­PCR  using  SuperScript  II  
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, 18064014).

cDNA  regions  were  amplified  using  TakaRa  Ex  Taq  (TAKARA  BIO, 
RR001A) for SMARCB1 and NF2 and the Expand Long­Template PCR sys­
tem (Roche Applied Science, 11681842001) for LZTR1. Direct shotgun Sanger 
sequencing of the entire coding regions was subsequently performed on an ABI 
PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer, and sequences were analyzed using SeqScape 
software v 2.5 (Applied Biosystem by Life Technologies) and mutation inter­
pretation software Alamut v.2.3 (Interactive Biosoftware). Primer sequences 
are available upon request.

To compensate for the location of the forward RT­PCR primer in exons 1 
of SMARCB1 and LZTR1 and the alternative transcripts affecting SMARCB1 
exon 2 and LZTR1 exon 15, genomic DNA analysis of exons 1–3 of SMARCB1 
and of exons 1 and 15 of LZTR1 was performed for each sample in parallel to 
RT­PCR. All mutations found at the cDNA level were confirmed by analysis 
at the genomic DNA level.

Genomic DNA–based mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was amplified for all 
exons of the NF2, SMARCB1 and LZTR1 genes and for part of the 3′ UTR of the 
SMARCB1 and LZTR1 genes from peripheral blood leukocyte samples and fresh 
or formalin­fixed paraffin­embedded tumor tissues. SMARCB1 and LZTR1 
amplicons were generated using LightScanner Master Mix (Idaho Technology, 
HRLS­ASY­0003), and NF2 amplicons were generated using the Platinum Taq 
DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, 10966­034).

PCR runs for all LZTR1 exons and for exons 1 of SMARCB1 and NF2 con­
tained DMSO to a final concentration of 5%. All primers were tagged with 
M13 to facilitate downstream sequencing (primer sequences available upon 
request). PCR products were sequenced bidirectionally on an ABI PRISM 
3130xl or 3730 Genetic Analyzer, and sequences were analyzed using SeqScape 
software v2.5 and the mutation interpretation software Alamut.

Comprehensive  analysis  of  schwannomas  included  sequencing  of  all 
SMARCB1 and NF2 exons and flanking intronic sequences (at least from −20 
to +15 bp relative to the exon boundaries). LZTR1 mutations identified in 
blood were confirmed in tumors by targeted sequencing of the corresponding

changes (deletions or duplications) of the NF2 and SMARCB1 loci and flank­
ing genes, genomic DNA extracted from blood leukocytes and schwannoma 
tumors was analyzed by multiplex ligation­dependent probe amplification 
(MLPA) using the SALSA MLPA kit (MRC­Holland, P044_B1, P258_C1) 
according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. Notably, the SMARCB1 SALSA 
MLPA kit also contains a probe assessing LZTR1; therefore, a deletion or 
duplication encompassing this region would also be detected. Owing to the 
quality of the DNA extracted from formalin­fixated paraffin­embedded tissue, 
MLPA analysis was not of sufficient quality in some samples, and microsatellite 
marker analysis was therefore used to assess the loss of 22q in such cases.

Microsatellite marker analysis. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity for the 
region of chromosome 22 encompassing LZTR1, SMARCB1 and NF2 was 
analyzed using microsatellite markers as previously described42.

Predictions of the effects of missense mutations. Three software programs 
were used to predict the effects of missense mutations as previously described: 
PolyPhen45, SIFT46 and MutationTaster47.

In addition, predictions were generated on the basis of sequence align­
ment, secondary structure prediction, molecular modeling and residue per­
mutation. All sequences were obtained from Ensembl. Conserved domains 
were searched against the CDDv3.08­43334 PSSMs (Position­Specific Score 
Matrices) and SMART v6.0­1013 PSSMs databases, through the NCBI web­
site48–50. The Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (Phyre) was 
used for secondary structure prediction51. SWISS­MODEL (automated mode) 
was applied for homology modeling52–54. Homology models used included 
the crystal structure of the Kelch domain of human Keap1 (Protein Data Bank 
(PDB) 1U6D), the crystal structure of the SPOP BTB domain complexed with 
the Cul3 N­terminal domain (PDB 4EOZ)55,56 and the solution structure of 
the BACK domain of Kelch repeat– and BTB domain–containing protein 4 
(PDB  2EQX).  Residue  permutation  and  illustrations  were  generated  with 
PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 
1.5.0.4 Schrödinger).

Predictions  of  nuclear  localization  signal  and  subcellular  localization. 
LZTR1 nuclear localization signal was predicted with MyHits Motif Scan57 
and through PSORT II prediction58. LZTR1 subcellular localization was pre­
dicted with WoLF PSORT59.

Analysis of variants from ESP6500, ESP2500, the 1000 Genomes Project, 
dbSNP and COSMIC. All LZTR1 variants were downloaded from the ESP6500 
database. Although this database was very useful in establishing the absence 
of any given mutation found in our cohort, it was less useful in evaluating the 
significance of rare LZTR1 variants, mainly because of a lack of large­scale 
validation of the variants. In general, indel calls were less robust than SNP 
calls and had a higher false positive rate. After review of the data, 12 possible 
loss­of­function mutations (9 mutations with a single occurrence, 1 mutation 
occurring twice and 2 recurrent mutations) were identified, 6 of which were 
indels. Five of the six indels affected homopolymer runs, which are known to 
be prone to artifacts. We have specifically investigated the two recurrent indel 
mutations present in ESP6500 (c.21del1 (allele count A1 = 66, R = 11,900; 
genotype count: A1/A1 = 7, A1/R = 52, R/R = 5,924) and c.1506_1507insG 
(allele count A1 = 143, R = 11,227; genotype count: A1/A1 = 17, A1/R = 
109, R/R = 5,559) (where R is the reference allele), which both had genotype 
counts deviating from Hardy­Weinberg equilibri)um. We screened a large set 
of anonymous control samples (previously submitted for Fragile X testing and 
found to be negative for the presence of FMR1 intermediate alleles, premuta­
tion or full mutation and for the presence of the two recurrent frameshift 
indels c.21delG and c.1506_1507insG). These indels, respectively, were present 
in none of the 981 and 572 control individuals (c.21del1 (allele count A1 = 0,  
R  =  1,962;  genotype  count:  A1/A1  =  0,  A1/R  =  0,  R/R  =  981;  two­tailed  
P value = 0.0018 using χ2 with Yates’ correction) and c.1506_1507insG (allele 
count A1 = 0, R = 1,144; genotype count: A1/A1 = 0, A1/R = 0, R/R = 572;  
two­tailed P value = 0.0002 using χ2 with Yates’ correction). These results are 
extremely statistically significant.

After we had proven that indel calls were less robust and represented false 
discovery data points, we used NHLBI ESP2500 and 1000 Genomes Project 
data as a point of reference for the assessment of LZTR1 variation in controls, 
as ESP2500 and 1000 Genomes Project data were obtained after applying more 
stringent filter criteria.

For the ESP2500 data, variants have been deposited in dbSNP (local batch 
ESP2500) by NHLBI ESP. From dbSNP138, we downloaded all the ESP2500 
data by batch query of ESP2500 (ref. 60). However, on the basis of dbSNP 
entries, none of the LZTR1 ESP2500 data have been confirmed independ­
ently using a different method (such as Sanger sequencing), but all calls were 
obtained after more stringent filtering criteria were applied.

For the 1000 Genomes Project database, Phase 1 variants were extracted 
with the UCSC Table Browser from the 1000G Ph1 Vars track. Only Phase 1 
variants were used in subsequent in silico analysis, as variant calls for this subset 
are of higher quality than variants from the pilot phase61. Variants were further 
annotated with SeattleSeq Annotation 137 (version 8.07 as of 3 July 2013).

Overall data in COSMIC include both mutations that are confirmed to be 
somatic and are therefore tumor specific and mutations whose somatic status is 
unknown (and where it is therefore unknown whether these mutations might 
be present in the germline). The overall spectrum of COSMIC LZTR1 muta­
tions consisted of 83 mutations: 1 nonsense, 62 missense (25 of 62 confirmed 
to  be  somatic),  16  synonymous,  3  frameshift  and  3  splice­site  mutations.  
We have specifically selected from the COSMIC database all mutations that 
were confirmed to be somatic for further analysis and comparison with vari­
ants from the other databases.
