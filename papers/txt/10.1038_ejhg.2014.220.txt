Schwannomatosis is characterized by the development of multiple non-vestibular, non-intradermal schwannomas. Constitutional
inactivating variants in two genes, SMARCB1 and, very recently, LZTR1, have been reported. We performed exome sequencing
of 13 schwannomatosis patients from 11 families without SMARCB1 deleterious variants. We identiﬁed four individuals with
heterozygous loss-of-function variants in LZTR1. Sequencing of the germline of 60 additional patients identiﬁed 18 additional
heterozygous variants in LZTR1. We identiﬁed LZTR1 variants in 43% and 30% of familial (three of the seven families) and
sporadic patients, respectively. In addition, we tested LZTR1 protein immunostaining in 22 tumors from nine unrelated patients
with and without LZTR1 deleterious variants. Tumors from individuals with LZTR1 variants lost the protein expression in at least
a subset of tumor cells, consistent with a tumor suppressor mechanism. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that molecular
analysis of LZTR1 may contribute to the molecular characterization of schwannomatosis patients, in addition to NF2
mutational analysis and the detection of chromosome 22 losses in tumor tissue. It will be especially useful in differentiating
schwannomatosis from mosaic Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2). However, the role of LZTR1 in the pathogenesis of
schwannomatosis needs further elucidation.

INTRODUCTION
Schwannomatosis (MIM 162091) is a tumor predisposition syndrome
characterized by the development of multiple intracranial, spinal and
peripheral schwannomas, without involvement of the vestibular nerve,
which is pathognomonic of Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2; MIM
101000).1,2 NF2 and schwannomatosis patients share common clinical
features; however, germline NF2 gene mutations are not identiﬁed in
schwannomatosis patients. In 1996, schwannomatosis was recognized
as a distinct clinical entity from NF23 by the molecular analysis of
tumors from schwannomatosis patients: schwannomatosis-associated
schwannomas frequently harbor inactivating variants of the NF2 gene
and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 22q, exclusively in tumors.
Therefore, the hallmark of schwannomatosis is different somatic
variants in multiple tumors from the same patient.2

Schwannomatosis is a genetic condition, but for poorly understood
reasons its occurrence does not follow common inheritance patterns.
The majority of cases are sporadic with 15–25% of cases being
inherited from an affected parent.4 The transmission risk can be
assumed to be 50% in an individual with proven family history, but
the risks for sporadic cases are less clear. In addition, non-penetrance
has been described.4

In 2007, germline variants in the SMARCB1 gene, located on 22q
centromeric to NF2, were identiﬁed in schwannomatosis patients,

implicating it as the ﬁrst predisposing gene for schwannomatosis.5
However, genetic studies demonstrated that constitutional variants in
this gene occur only in 40–50% of familial cases and in 8–10% of
sporadic cases.6–9 Very recently, germline variants in a novel gene,
LZTR1, were identiﬁed in 100% of familial cases and in about 70% of
sporadic patients.10 LZTR1 is also located on 22q, centromeric to
SMARCB1.

In SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis, tumorigenesis
follows the 4-hits/3-step model: the germline mutated SMARCB1 or
LZTR1 gene, as well as the somatic NF2 variant, are retained in the
tumor, whereas the other chromosome 22 (or at least a segment
containing wild-type SMARCB1, LZTR1 or NF2) is lost.11

To further assess the clinical

indications for LZTR1 molecular
screening in medical genetics practice, we evaluated its involvement in
the pathogenesis of a series of SMARCB1-unrelated schwannomatosis
patients.

LZTR1 variants in schwannomatosis
I Paganini et al

was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by the ethical
committee of Careggi Hospital (protocol no. 0062368/2011).

Data of the study (variants and phenotypes) were submitted at the gene
variant database (URL: http://lovd.nl/3.0/home) with patient IDs 17623–17625,
17628–17630 and 17632–17646.

Exome sequencing
DNA was extracted from blood and fresh tumor tissues, and sequence libraries
were generated following standard Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) protocols
established in the UCLA Clinical Genomics Center for Clinical Exome
Sequencing. The sample libraries were uniquely tagged and hybridized with
capture oligonucleotides from the Agilent SureSelect 50 Mb All Exon capture
kit to enrich for exons (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and then sequenced on
an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

Bioinformatic analysis
First, reads that pass Illumina quality ﬁlters were converted from qseq to fastq
ﬁle format. Novoalign, using an index of the NCBI human genome reference
build 37(HG37), produced a binary SAM (bam) ﬁle of aligned reads. PCR
duplicates for all ﬁles were marked using Picard’s MarkDuplicates command
and ignored in downstream analysis.

Genome analysis toolkit (GATK) was used for variant calling.12,13 Quality
scores generated by the sequencer were recalibrated to more closely represent
the actual probability of mismatching the reference genome by analyzing the
covariation among reported quality score, position within the read, dinucleotide
and probability of a reference mismatch. Then, local realignment around small
insertion/deletions (indels) was again performed, this time using GATK’s indel
realigner to minimize the number of mismatching bases across all the reads.
This removes alignment artifacts that can cause false-positive single-nucleotide
variations (SNVs). Statistically signiﬁcant non-reference variants, SNVs and
indels, were identiﬁed using the GATK uniﬁed genotyper. Using the GATK
variant annotator, each identiﬁed SNV and indel was annotated with various
statistics,
including allele balance, depth of coverage, strand balance and
multiple quality metrics. These statistics were then used to identify likely
false-positive SNPs using the GATK variant quality score recalibrator (VQSR).
Variants with a VQSR score under a chosen threshold were assumed to be false
and ﬁltered out, leaving a set of likely true variants.

After the variants were identiﬁed, an in-house variant annotator based on
ENSEMBL (ensembl.org) was used to additionally annotate each variant with
information including dbSNP ID, gene names and accession numbers, variant
consequences, protein positions and amino-acid changes, conservation scores,
HapMap frequencies, tissue-speciﬁc expression, Polyphen and SIFT predictions
on the effect of the variant on protein function and clinical association.14 Novel
(non-dbSNP) variants predicted to be protein damaging by Polyphen or SIFT
were included for further analyses. Potentially causative variants were identiﬁed
by ﬁltering for damaging, heterozygous variants found in the affected patients
and absent in unaffected family members.

High-resolution melting analysis
Blood DNAs were analyzed by high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA),
performed on a Rotor Gene_6000 Instrument (Corbett Research, Sydney,
Australia), followed by direct sequencing of amplicons showing an abnormal
melting curve.

Sanger sequencing
interest, and the entire coding sequences of LZTR1,
All variants of
SMARCB1 and NF2, were sequenced with PCR and capillary sequencing.
All primers were designed using Primer3Plus
(http://primer3plus.com/
web_3.0.0/primer3web_input.htm) and ordered from MWG-Biotech AG
(Ebersberg, Germany). Primer sequences are available on request. Capillary
sequencing was performed on Biosystems 3100 or 310 Capillary DNA Analyzer
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Raw and analyzed sequence results
were visualized on Sequence Scanner v1.0 (Life Technologies).

Variants were named according to the reference sequences NM_006767.3
(LZTR1) and NM_181832.2 (NF2). LZTR1 exons were numbered as in
NG_034193.1.

Microsatellite analysis
LOH on 22q was investigated using microsatellites D22S420, D22S1174,
D22S315, D22S1154, D22S1163, D22S280, D22S277 and D22S1169 from the
ABI PRISM Linkage Mapping set version 2.5 (Life Technologies). PCR products
were analyzed on a model 310 automated sequencer (Life Technologies); after
electrophoresis, data were analyzed using GeneMapper
(Life
Technologies).

software

Multiplex ligation probe ampliﬁcation
Copy number changes (deletions or duplications) of SMARCB1, NF2 and
LZTR1 loci and ﬂanking genes were analyzed by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent
Probe Ampliﬁcation (MLPA) when fresh tumor tissues were available.
SMARCB1, NF2 and 22q11 MLPA test kits (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands; P044_B1, P258_C1 and P324_A2) were used and electrophoresis
data were analyzed using GeneMapper software (Life Technologies).

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections (3 µm thick) were deparafﬁnized
and rehydrated. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed with Dako
(Glostrup, Denmark) target retrieval solution (pH 9) for 25 min at 98 °C. Slides
were treated with 3% H2O2 in dH2O for 10 min and then incubated in 10%
normal goat serum for 30 min. Incubation with the primary antibody against
LZTR1 (NBP1-77121, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) was carried out
for 1 h at room temperature (dilution 1/25) and with the secondary antibody
(Biotinylated goat anti-rat, BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA) for 30 min at room temperature (dilution 1/2000). Biotin was detected
using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Slides were counterstained with hematox-
ylin, dehydrated and then mounted with xylene-based liquid mounting media.

In silico analysis
The following tools designed to provide splicing prediction were used: Human
Splicing Finder (http://www.umd.be/HSF/),15 splice site prediction by neural
network (NNSplice; http://www.fruitﬂy.org/seq_tools/splice.html)16 and Auto-
mated Splice Site and Exon Deﬁnition Analysis (ASSEDA) server (http://splice.
uwo.ca).17

The predicted effects of missense variants on LZTR1 function were assessed
using the following open access software: PolyPhen 2 (http://genetics.bwh.
harvard.edu/pph2/),18 SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/www/SIFT_enst_submit.html),19
Mutation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/)20 and ClustalW2 (http://

RESULTS
To identify additional determinants of schwannomatosis, we per-
formed exome-sequencing analysis in 4 sporadic and 9 familial cases
from 11 unrelated families with SMARCB1-unrelated schwannoma-
tosis. Exome sequencing identiﬁed four deleterious variants of the
LZTR1 gene in four unrelated families that were veriﬁed by Sanger
sequencing (Table 1). The ﬁrst variant identiﬁed in two affected
members of
in exon 13,
c.1373dupG, which introduces a stop codon after 210 amino acids
and is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the
corresponding mRNA (Figure 1). The second variant, c.791+1G4A,
identiﬁed in patient 3857, affected the donor splice site of intron 8.
No RNA was available for further analysis; however, the disruption of
the donor splice site of intron 8 is predicted to cause the skipping of
exon 8 with a frameshift and the gain of a stop codon in exon 9. By
direct sequencing, we found the same variant in her affected brother,
conﬁrming the segregation of the variant with the disease. The third
variant, a frameshift alteration in exon 4, c.352dupC, predicted to
cause NMD, was found in the sporadic patient from family 467 and in
her unaffected father; moreover, the wild-type allele was lost in three
of the four tumors analyzed. The fourth variant, a frameshift alteration
in exon 14, c.1602delA, was conﬁrmed in a patient from family 307

and his unaffected father, but not in his affected brother (Figure 1).
The lack of segregation of the c.1602delA variant in one of the
affected, and its presence in the healthy father, might argue against its
pathogenic role; however, the mutated LZTR1 allele was retained in
the two available tumors of II:2 (Figure 1). To rule out the possibility
of non-paternity and to determine which paternal chromosome 22
was inherited by the two siblings, we performed microsatellite analysis
in the family. The six microsatellites tested (D22S420, D22S1174,
D22S1154, D22S1163, D22S277 and D22S1170) ruled out non-
paternity and clearly demonstrated that the siblings inherited the
two different chromosomes
the
microsatellite analysis of the brothers’ tumors demonstrated that in
both cases the paternal chromosome was retained in the tumors
(Figure 1).

from the father.

In addition,

To further assess the involvement of LZTR1 in schwannomatosis,
we screened all coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries of
LZTR1 in 60 additional SMARCB1-unrelated schwannomatosis cases.
Previously unidentiﬁed deleterious variants in LZTR1 were found in
18 of these cases. In total, 22 distinct LZTR1 variants (Table 1) were
identiﬁed in 24 of 74 subjects from 70 unrelated families (30% and
43% of sporadic and familial cases, respectively). In ﬁve sporadic cases,
the LZTR1 variant was
for which parental DNA was available,
inherited from an unaffected parent.

The LZTR1 variants found were nonsense or frameshift predicted to
cause NMD in nine patients. In one patient (381), we found a
frameshift variant that led to a new stop codon in the 3′-untranslated
open reading frame, predicting an elongated protein. In patient 318 we
identiﬁed an in-frame deletion of three nucleotides, predicted to cause
deletion of valine 124 in the LZTR1 protein, which would disrupt
the Kelch domain. Seven different missense variants were found in
LZTR1; they involve amino acids highly conserved across species
(Supplementary Table 3) and predicted to be deleterious by
MutationTaster,20 PolyPhen 2 (ref. 18) and SIFT.19 Four of these
missense variants involve amino acids (His71, Leu187, Arg284 and
Met400) likely to disrupt the Kelch domain; the missense variants
involving Ala465, Arg697 and Cys760 are likely to disrupt the ﬁrst, the
second and the last BTB domains, respectively.

To evaluate the presence of mosaicism in patients without LZTR1
variants, we sequenced LZTR1 in ﬁve tumors from three unrelated
cases, but all were wild type.

We then checked loss on 22q by microsatellite and MLPA analyses
(Supplementary Figure 1). LOH/MLPA analyses showed losses of 22q
involving the LZTR1 locus in 14 of 28 tumors from 11 unrelated
patients. D22S420 was not informative in tumors from four patients;
in each of these cases, sequencing analysis showed that the mutant
LZTR1 allele was retained in the tumors with reduction of the
wild-type peak height,
the wild-type allele.

Figure 1 Sequence analysis of LZTR1 in blood and tumors of mutated patients. Asterisks indicate subjects in the family who carry the variant. (a) The
frameshift variant in exon 13 of LZTR1 was detected in the genomic DNA from the proband (arrow) and his affected father. The variant was present in the
proband’s schwannoma T714, which retained both alleles. (b) The frameshift variant in exon 16 of LZTR1 is present in the proband and her unaffected
father and is retained in two schwannomas. (c) A frameshift variant in exon 14, c.1602delA (p.Lys534Asnfs*22), was identiﬁed in the proband from family
307 and his unaffected father, but not in the affected brother. The altered LZTR1 allele was retained in two tumors of the brother. Haplotype analysis for
chromosome 22 markers in the family clearly indicated that the affected siblings inherited the two different chromosomes 22 from their father.

In Supplementary Table 4, we summarize the somatic NF2 variants in
schwannomatosis-associated schwannomas from patients with germ-
inal LZTR1 variants.

Finally, we tested LZTR1 protein immunostaining in 22 tumors
from nine unrelated patients with or without LZTR1 deleterious
variants (Supplementary Figure 2). We used seven vestibular schwan-
nomas from seven unrelated NF2 patients as positive controls.
Compared with NF2-associated schwannomas, tumors from patients
with variants in LZTR1 exhibited absent or reduced immunostaining.
In contrast, tumors from LZTR1-unrelated schwannomatosis patients
showed diffuse positive immunostaining, comparable with the NF2-
associated tumors. Tumors from patients with nonsense or frameshift
LZTR1 variants had almost complete negative immunostaining,
whereas patients carrying splicing or missense variants showed
reduced immunostaining
compared with the NF2-associated
schwannomas.

DISCUSSION
Currently, germline deleterious variants in two tumor suppressor
genes, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, are involved in schwannomatosis
predisposition.5,10 In our study, we report our experience with LZTR1
gene mutational screening in a large cohort of SMARCB1-negative
schwannomatosis patients. We found 24 patients, from 22 unrelated
families, carrying germline variants of LZTR1. Unlike glioblastomas,
where somatic variants are preferentially located in the Kelch domains
of the LZTR1 protein,24 our data conﬁrm that, in schwannomatosis
patients, germline LZTR1 variants occur along the entire sequence of
the gene. However, we identiﬁed LZTR1 variants in a lower propor-
tion of patients compared with the earlier report:10 43% versus 100%
and 30% versus 73% of familial and sporadic patients, respectively.
One explanation might be our mutation-detection strategy, as we used
HRMA to screen the entire coding sequence of the gene instead of
direct sequencing; however, HRMA has an overall sensitivity of 99.3%

European Journal of Human Genetics

to detect heterozygous variants25 and, in our experience, it is more
sensitive than direct sequencing in detecting NF2 mosaic alterations.26
Another explanation might be the patient selection criteria. Piotrowski
et al10 only included patients with a molecularly conﬁrmed diagnosis
of schwannomatosis by the ﬁnding of different NF2 variants in
multiple tumors of the patients. In contrast, we analyzed patients
with a conﬁrmed clinical diagnosis according to the current
schwannomatosis diagnostic criteria,4 and we performed molecular
diagnosis on multiple schwannomas only in 15 patients (1 familial and
14 sporadic). If we focus on the 14 sporadic patients with a conﬁrmed
diagnosis of tumors, we found variants in 10 of them (71%), a result
comparable to that of the previous report.10 Our lower detection rate
in the entire cohort of our patients may be because some might
actually be mosaic NF2, and, consequently, the diagnostic criteria for
schwannomatosis should be reevaluated in the light of these new
discoveries.

Our work conﬁrms that LZTR1 is the most prevalent gene causing
schwannomatosis. However, a fraction of schwannomatosis cases,
mainly the sporadic ones, remain genetically unsolved. For these
unexplained cases we cannot exclude the presence of unrecognized
large deletions or duplications of the LZTR1 gene that are not detected
by Sanger sequencing; however, genomic rearrangements are usually
rarer than point variants. To explain the LZTR1- and SMARCB1-
negative patients, Piotrowski et al10 hypothesized the presence of
somatic mosaicism for SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variants. However, we
demonstrated the absence of mosaicism in at least three SMARCB1-
and LZTR1-negative patients by the analysis of multiple tumors of the
patients, which did not carry alterations in SMARCB1 or LZTR1 but
showed different somatic NF2 variants. Furthermore, multiple tumors
from two of these patients showed positive LZTR1 immunostaining,
involvement of LZTR1 in schwannoma
suggesting the lack of
development. Considering that we did not ﬁnd SMARCB1 or LZTR1
deleterious variants in six familial schwannomatosis patients analyzed,
our ﬁndings suggest
the involvement of an as yet unidentiﬁed
schwannomatosis gene(s) in a subset of cases.

The mutational analysis of LZTR1 in sporadic schwannomatosis
patients reveals some inconsistences. First, variants were inherited
from an unaffected parent in nine sporadic patients (from this and
Piotrowski et al10 reports) and there were no additional affected
members in their families. Incomplete penetrance might be one
explanation, but the lack of families with multiple affected members
prevents the veriﬁcation of this hypothesis.

In addition, we found a family (307) with two affected siblings; only
one of them carried the LZTR1 deleterious variant that was inherited
by the unaffected father, whereas the other sibling had wild-type
LZTR1 and SMARCB1 sequences;
the two affected
brothers inherited two different chromosomes 22 from the father.
This suggests that more than one gene could be involved in the same
schwannomatosis family.

furthermore,

Currently,

there is no evidence regarding protein interactions
between LZTR1 and SMARCB1, nor that they are part of a common
signaling pathway. LZTR1 encodes a member of
the BTB-kelch
superfamily; the protein localizes exclusively to the Golgi network
where it may help stabilize the Golgi complex.27 Recent studies
also suggest that LZTR1 is an adaptor in CUL3 ubiquitin ligase
complexes.24 The tumor suppressor SMARCB1 is a core component of
the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex;28 the complex is
involved in nucleosome mobilization and makes compacted DNA
accessible to transcription factors and repair enzymes. In the future,
schwannomatosis research will be focused on understanding how
proteins with so dissimilar functions could cause the same disorder.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that molecular analysis of
the LZTR1 gene in clinical genetics practice may contribute to
molecular characterization of schwannomatosis patients, especially in
distinguishing schwannomatosis with mosaic NF2. However, the role
of LZTR1 in the pathogenesis of schwannomatosis needs to be further
clariﬁed. In addition, the assessment of genomic DNA from LZTR1-
and SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis patients and their tumors
should also be carried out to discover other genes contributing to the
pathogenesis of this disorder.
