Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common cancer predisposition syndrome. NF1
patients present with a constellation of clinical manifestations and have an increased risk of
developing certain benign and malignant tumors. This disease results from mutation within
the gene encoding neuroﬁbromin, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ras. Functional loss
of this protein compromises Ras inactivation, which leads to the aberrant growth and
proliferation of neural crest-derived cells and, ultimately, tumor formation. Current man-
agement of NF1-associated malignancy involves radiation, surgical excision, and cytotoxic
drugs. The limited success of these strategies has fueled researchers to further elucidate the
molecular changes that drive tumor formation and progression. This discussion will high-
light how intracellular signaling molecules, cell-surface receptors, and the tumor micro-
environment constitute potential therapeutic targets, which may be relevant not only to
NF1-related malignancy but also to other human cancers.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1: introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common inherited
cancer predisposition syndrome, having a birth incidence of
1:3000 [1]. NF1 is marked by the aberrant proliferation of
tissues derived from the neural crest. Patients with this
disease present with a constellation of clinical manifesta-
tions, including pigmentation lesions on the skin (cafe´ au lait
macules), hamartomas of the iris (lisch nodules), learning
disabilities, and malformations of the skeletal and cardio-
vascular systems [2]. NF1 patients are also at a higher risk of
developing certain tumors, most notably optic pathway
gliomas and neuroﬁbromas. Neuroﬁbromas comprise pre-
dominantly transformed Schwann cells and can involve any
peripheral nerve. These tumors undergo malignant progres-
sion to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)
in approximately 10% of all cases and remain the major
source of morbidity and mortality [3]. Traditional manage-
ment of NF1-associated tumors involves radiation, surgical
excision, and cytotoxic drugs but provides limited long-term
success [4]. The need for more speciﬁc approaches has fueled
researchers to further elucidate the molecular changes that
distinguish transformed Schwann cells
from normal
Schwann cells.

Loss of neuroﬁbromin deregulates Ras

2.
signaling

NF1 is caused by mutation within the gene encoding the
protein neuroﬁbromin (Nf1). This protein plays a critical role in
embryological development and remains important to the
normal physiology of certain cell types, especially neural crest
derivatives [5]. Germline mutation of one neuroﬁbromin allele
results in global haploinsufﬁciency that leads to cellular
dysfunction in neural crest derivatives. The majority of
clinical manifestations of this disease are thought to be a
consequence of this haploinsufﬁciency. Disruption of both
neuroﬁbromin alleles (‘‘loss of heterozygosity’’) in Schwann
cells deregulates critical cell signaling pathways and drives
malignant tumor progression [1,2].

Nf1 contains a central domain (the Nf1-GAP-related
domain or Nf1-GRD) that shares extensive sequence homol-
ogy with other GAPs that regulate Ras [6]. Ras is a small
GTPase and plays a central role in cell survival, proliferation,
and differentiation by transducing responses to growth
stimuli initiated at the cell surface to several intracellular
signaling molecules [7]. Ras functions as a molecular switch:
it toggles between an inactive (GDP-bound) state and an
active (GTP-bound) state. Transition from one state to the
other is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs), which mediate the replacement of GDP with GTP, and
by GAPs, which catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP. Nf1 accel-
erates the rate of Ras-GTP hydrolysis 105-fold more quickly,
compared to the intrinsic rate of Ras-GTP hydrolysis [8];
therefore, Nf1 serves as a potent negative regulator of Ras.
Activating point mutations in codons 12,13, or 61 of Ras lead
to forms that are resistant to GAP-mediated hydrolysis.
These constitutively active (oncogenic) mutants drive aber-
rant cell division and contribute to over 30% of all human

Fig. 1 – Loss of neurofibromin deregulates Ras signaling. In
response to growth factors, the EGFR recruits a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor Sos, which activates Ras. In its
active, GTP-bound, form, Ras initiates several signaling
cascades, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways, in order
to regulate cell growth, survival, and proliferation.
Functional loss of neurofibromin compromises Ras
inactivation and drives aberrant Ras-dependent signaling,
which contributes to tumor formation and progression.

cancers [9,10]. Ras is structurally normal in NF1 tumor cells;
however, as diagrammed in Fig. 1, functional loss of Nf1
compromises Ras inactivation and drives deregulated Ras-
dependent signaling pathways [11]. Studies have conﬁrmed
the prediction that Nf1-deﬁcient Schwann cells maintain an
accumulation of active Ras (up to 15 times higher than
normal counterparts) and an increase in Ras-dependent
signaling [12,13]. This aberrant Ras signaling occurs despite
the continued expression of other proteins with Ras-GAP
activity, which suggests a unique ability of Nf1 to regulate Ras
at speciﬁc subcellular locations [12]. Nf1 likely serves
functions outside its role as a Ras-GAP; for example, Nf1
can associate with microtubules and regulate cellular cyclic
AMP levels [14–16]. Additional genetic or epigenetic events
involving loci outside the Nf1 gene (inactivation of pRb, p53,
p15 (INK4b), p16 (INK4a), p14 (ARF), p27 (Kip1), cyclin D1,
MDM2, etc.) may also contribute to NF1-related malignancy
[17–19]. However, introduction of the Nf1-GRD alone restores
normal growth to Nf1-deﬁcient Schwann cells [20].
In
addition, a speciﬁc point mutation within the Nf1-GRD,
which speciﬁcally abolishes Ras-GAP activity but does not
affect the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein
(conserving other putative functional domains within the
protein), results in classical expression of the disease [21].
These observations underline the importance of Ras activa-
tion in the disease process and highlight Ras as a plausible
pharmacological target.

Ras as a therapeutic target

Ras is translated on free ribosomes and then undergoes a
series of post-translational modiﬁcations to achieve mem-
brane attachment (Fig. 2). This post-translational processing is
directed at its four most C-terminal residues: its ‘‘CaaX’’ box
(‘‘C’’ = cysteine,
‘‘a’’ = aliphatic, and ‘‘X’’ = any amino acid,
usually, methionine, serine, or glutamine) [22]. First, a 15-
carbon farnesyl group is covalently attached to the cysteine.
Second, the last three residues are cleaved. Third, the
prenylated cysteine is methylated. In addition to these steps,
N- and H-Ras isoforms are further modiﬁed with the
attachment of a palmitate group. These modiﬁcations (for
K-Ras, a poly-lysine stretch of amino acids takes the place of
palmitoylation) facilitate association with lipid membranes
and govern subcellular localization as well as protein–protein
interactions [23]; moreover, these modiﬁcations are essential
not only for the normal function of Ras but also for the
transforming activity of Ras [24,25].

In an attempt to antagonize Ras activity in cancer cells,
researchers have employed drugs that inhibit the various
enzymes responsible for CaaX-box alterations with the
rationale that improper CaaX processing leads to mislocalized
and thus non-functional protein [24,26,27]. Mislocalized
constitutively active Ras may recruit and sequester signaling
molecules to inappropriate subcellular locations [28]. This

Fig. 2 – Ras and Ras-dependent signaling molecules are
pharmacological targets. Ras is translated on free
ribosomes and then undergoes a series of post-
translational modifications in order to achieve membrane
attachment. This post-translational processing is directed
at the C-terminal CaaX box and includes farnesylation,
cleavage, and methylation. N- and H-Ras are,
subsequently, palmitoylated at cysteine residues that
neighbor the CaaX box. The attachment of these lipid
moieties governs subcellular localization and
protein:protein interactions and is crucial for both the
physiological and transforming ability of Ras.
Pharmacologically targeting the enzymes involved with
Ras processing or signaling molecules downstream of Ras
provides numerous therapeutic strategies. Abbreviations:

action may limit the amount of substrate available for properly
located Ras proteins. There exist at least two different
approaches to blocking the prenylation step. The lipid group
donor, farnesyl pyrophosphate, is an intermediate in the
biosynthesis of both prenylated proteins and cholesterol, and
its production depends on the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.
Inhibiting this enzyme with a member of the statin family of
drugs reduces the formation of lipid substrate and interferes
with CaaX processing [26,27]. Blocking the attachment of
farnesyl to Ras accomplishes the same goal. The latter
approach is accomplished by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl
protein transferase, using farnesyl protein transferase inhi-
bitors (FTIs) [28]. It has been proposed that statins’ ability to
regulate protein prenylation allows these drugs not only to
lower cholesterol but also to inﬂuence multiple cellular
functions important in tumor formation and metastasis.
These functions include cell proliferation, motility, adhesion,
and invasion [29]. Regarding NF1, statins may also serve a
therapeutic role separate from that in tumor formation. One
report describes the ability of lovastatin to rescue neuronal
long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning deﬁcits in Nf1
conditional knockout mice [30].

The FTIs lonafarnib (SCH 66336), tipifarnib (R115777), BMS-
214662, FTI-277, and L-744,832 have produced promising results
in preclinical trials [31,32]. They have been shown to inhibit the
growth of numerous human tumor cell lines in vitro and have
resulted in either tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression
in a spectrum of xenograft models involving hematological,
head and neck, ovarian, lung, colon, breast, bladder, melanoma,
and prostate cancers [24,33]. The literature regarding the use of
FTIs with NF1-derived cell lines is more limited. Yan et al.
showed that the treatment with FTIs led to growth inhibition
and morphological reversion of an MPNST cell line [27]. Weiss
et al. showed that L-744,832 inhibited H-Ras prenylation in
primary Nf1-null hematopoietic cells [34] and Mahgoub et al.
demonstrated that the same drug blocked the proliferation of
Nf1-null myeloid progenitor colonies in response to granulo-
cyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [35]. The
FTI L-739,749 proved to reverse the proliferation of Nf1-null
Schwann cells but had no effect on the angiogenic or invasive
quality of these cells [36]. The use of lonafarnib and tipifarnib to
treat non-NF1 cancers in phase II and phase III clinical trials has
achieved limited success thus far compared to that in placebo
groups [24]. While there is an on-going phase II clinical trial
evaluating the effects of the FTI R115,777 on progressive
plexiform neuroﬁbromas (National Cancer Institute, NLM#:
NCT00021541), research has shifted to alternative strategies.

A number of factors may explain the limited usefulness of
FTIs in the clinic. Of the four Ras isoforms (N-, H-, and two K-
Ras), N- and K-Ras can, alternatively, become geranylgerany-
lated in the presence of FTIs [22,37]. This substituted lipid
group allows N- and K-Ras to signal from membranes and,
thus, circumvent the action of FTIs. With N- and K-Ras more
commonly mutated than H-Ras in human cancers, FTIs may
only be useful in a small subset of cases. NF1 seems to follow
this theme: we have shown that N- and K-Ras are the
predominant isoforms expressed and active in human NF1 cell
lines [12]. Recognizing the potential
limitation of FTIs,
researchers have investigated the effects of inhibiting ger-
anylgeranyl transferase, the protease (Ras converting enzyme)

1488

responsible for cleavage of the CaaX box, or the carboxy-
methylase responsible for methylation of the CaaX box [22,24]
(Fig. 2). While these approaches enable manipulation of N- and
K-Ras, another confounding issue exists: CaaX boxes are not
exclusive to Ras. About 0.5% of all proteins are prenylated,
including Ras, Rho proteins, the nuclear lamins, and certain
kinetechores [38,39]. Thus, the effects of CaaX-box processing
inhibitors on cell cycle, morphology, motility, etc. are not
attributed solely to blocking Ras function. For example, our
data show that the anti-proliferative effects of novel pro-drug
FTIs, especially in combination with Lovastatin, on vascular
smooth muscle cells [40] and on NF1 and non-NF1 MPNST
cells1 may at least in part be due to an effective block of RhoB
prenylation. The fact
tumors without Ras
mutations respond to FTIs and geranylgeranyltransferase
inhibitors (GGTIs) also supports the notion that the regulation
of non-Ras targets at least contributes to the anti-cancer
effects of these drugs [41].

that several

Ras-directed therapeutic approaches may require the
identiﬁcation of enzymes that show more selective action
on Ras proteins. One candidate may be the enzyme(s) involved
with Ras palmitoylation. Palmitate modiﬁcation is a dynamic
(reversible) process necessary for proper function of numer-
ous proteins, including Ras and Rho proteins, non-receptor
tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, and compo-
nents of the plasma membrane SNARE complex [42]. Soon
after the identiﬁcation of the putative protein fatty acyltrans-
ferase domain DHHC-CRD [43], Swarthout et al. described a
protein complex composed of DHHC9 and a golgi-localized
protein that possesses protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT)
activity for H- and N-Ras [44]. Palmitoylated cysteine residues
exist in a wide variety of sequence contexts and may mandate
a large family of PATs with different substrate speciﬁcities. At
least 23 DHHC-CRD-containing proteins have emerged from
human genomic sequencing [43].
Identiﬁcation of PATs
exclusive for Ras isoforms may provide avenues for more
speciﬁc drug design.

Ras: downstream effectors

Dasgupta et al. showed that blocking K-Ras by expressing a
dominant negative K-Ras protein reversed the proliferative
advantage and abnormal actin cytoskeletal-mediated pro-
cesses in Nf1-null astrocytes [45]. These results demonstrate
the advantage of reducing the activity of speciﬁc Ras
isoforms, yet this is not currently pharmacologically possible.
As a result, researchers have looked downstream of Ras. Ras
produces its effects on the cell via several effector molecules,
including those that constitute the Raf–MAPK–ERK and PI3K–
Akt axes [46] (Fig. 2). These signaling cascades mediate pro-
mitotic and pro-survival effects, and an upregulation of both
is correlated with the increase of Ras-GTP subsequent to loss
of Nf1 [12,27,47]. Multiple lines of evidence support the
importance of these pathways in NF1-related tumorigenesis.
While Schwann cells are normally quiescent, they re-enter
the cell cycle to proliferate and rebuild the myelin sheath
following nerve damage [48]. Regeneration involves de-

differentiation, proliferation, and re-differentiation. This
repair response is governed by the MAPK–ERK pathway [48]
and may parallel the process of tumorigenesis in Nf1-
deﬁcient cells. If increased activation of the Ras–ERK pathway
is responsible for the proliferative capacity of Nf1-deﬁcient
Schwann cells, blocking ERK activation should inhibit cell
division. Our group has shown that treatment of NF1 cell lines
with the MEK1, 2 inhibitors U0126, PD184352, and PD98059
resulted in concentration-dependent suppression of prolif-
eration [12]. Chadee and Kyriakis showed that blocking ERK
activation (along with blocking JNK and p38 activation) using
RNAi against mixed lineage factor 3 (MLK3) had anti-
proliferative results in MPNST cells [49]. Another target,
p21-activated kinase (PAK), may be relevant since it is
activated downstream of Ras (via Rac and CDC42) and
permits Ras-dependent activation of ERK [50,51]. Using a
dominant negative PAK vector to block ERK activation, Tang
et al. blocked Ras-mediated transformation of Schwann cells
[51]. Hirokawa and co-workers also supported the role of PAK
in Schwann cell
transformation by using the histone
deacetylase inhibitor FK228 to activate gelsolin and
p21(WAF) and to inhibit PAK, which led to regression of a
MPNST xenograft in nude mice [52].

PAK also promotes the PI3K–Akt pathway. This pathway
is upregulated in response to increased Ras-GTP levels and,
by protecting cancer cells from programmed cell death, may
enhance tumor growth [53]. The rationale for inhibiting
proteins within the MEK–ERK pathway extends to those that
constitute the PI3K–Akt pathway. The PI3K inhibtor
LY294002 was found to reduce EGF-stimulated cell growth
of MPNST cells [54].
Johannessen et al. proposed that
increased PI3K activation results in constitutive activation
of mTOR (by inactivating the protein TSC2); they found that
inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin also blocked the prolifera-
tion of MPNST cells [55]. Further support of these pathways
in tumorigenesis comes from work done by Huang et al.,
which shows that inhibiting either the PI3K or the MAPK
pathway decreased the migration of Nf1-null mouse
Schwann cells [56].

Ras: upstream activators

In response to soluble growth factors,

Due to crosstalk within protein networks, additional
intracellular signaling molecules will
likely emerge as
therapeutic targets, yet promising candidates exist on
the surface of cancer cells as well. One feature of MPNST
cells is their expression of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which is absent from normal Schwann cells
[57].
the EGFR
activates Ras, which in the context of Nf1-deﬁciency is
greatly potentiated. The acquisition of the EGFR is correlated
with the loss of Nf1 and may confer a growth advantage to
Schwann cells [57]. Our data suggest that the increase in
EGFR is a result downstream of activated N- and K-Ras. This
interaction between the EGFR and Ras (the
reciprocal
receptor activates a signaling molecule, which,
in turn,
increases expression of the receptor) establishes a positive
feedback loop and may drive cell proliferation and tumor
formation. Considering that normal Schwann cells do not

Fig. 3 – Tumor formation and progression rely on interactions between cancer and non-cancer cells. Schwann cells that have
undergone biallelic inactivation at the Nf1 locus and possibly additional genetic/epigenetic disturbances are thought to
make the largest contribution to MPNSTs. These tumors are heterogeneous, comprising mast cells, fibroblasts, and
perineural cells. Interaction among tumor cells and non-cancer surrounding cells, which are Nf1 haploinsufficient, may be
necessary for tumor formation and progression. In the upper right corner is a photograph of an NF1 patient with a large
dermal neurofibroma on his back. This patient has a one base (7005) deletion in the Nf1 coding region. In the lower right
corner is a microscopic view of a neurofibroma. This hematoxylin/eosin-stained image (viewed at 100) shows the
compact and interweaving arrangement of transformed Schwann cells, seen as large fusiform cells distributed throughout
the field. Fibroblasts (smaller fusiform cells) and infiltrating inflammatory cells (smaller, more darkly stained cells with
little cytoplasm) including mast cells are also visible (designated by an arrow) [2,7].

express the EGFR, researchers have predicted that trans-
formed Schwann cells depend on the receptor for their
proliferative capacity. DeClue et al. showed that EGF drives
MPNST cell proliferation and growth in soft agar [57]. Several
studies have investigated the effects of EGFR inhibitors on
cell cycle progression and division in NF1 tumor cells. Two
groups have reported the ability of the EGFR inhibitor
AG1478 to inhibit EGF-stimulated cell proliferation of MPNST
cells [54,57]. Furthermore, our work demonstrates the ability
of the FDA-approved EGFR inhibitor Iressa (AstraZeneca) to
produce a dose-dependent inhibition of EGF-mediated ERK
activation and a reduction in the proliferation of cells grown
in the presence of serum (with and without the addition of
EGF).2 Ling et al. have further validated the transforming
properties of the EGFR. This group showed that expression of
the EGFR in transgenic mouse Schwann cells led to
hyperplasia, collagen excess, and dissociation from neurons
[58]. Other evidence supporting the role of EGFR in tumor
progression and metastasis comes from Su et al., who
demonstrated that the presence of EGFR increased the
activity of CD44, which promotes cellular growth, adhesion,
and migration of Schwann cells [59]. An on-going Phase II
clinical trial
is evaluating the effects of Iressa on NF2-

2 [72].

associated meningiomas (National Cancer Institute, NLM#:
NCT00025675); however, the effect of inhibiting the EGFR in
NF1-associated malignancies has yet to be determined.

The EGFR is only one member of the ErbB family of
receptors. At least two other members, ErbB2 and ErbB3, are
normally expressed by proliferating Schwann cells [54,60].
Overexpression and activity of ErbB2 drives tumor formation
in certain breast cancers [61] and may play a role in NF1-
related malignancy as well. Schlegel et al. found an inverse
relationship between Nf1 expression and ErbB2 expression,
raising the possibility that Ras signaling may inﬂuence the
expression of multiple receptors [62]. The presence of ErbB2
on the surface of Schwann cells may be physiologic;
however,
the presence of over-expressed EGFR might
provide a dimerization partner for ErbB2 and, consequently,
confer a mechanism for increased ErbB2 activity. The result
might be pathological [63]. An increase in the secretion of
neuregulins (ligands for ErbB2/3) or other growth factors by
Nf1-null Schwann cells or Nf1 haploinsufﬁcient surrounding
tumor cells may fuel autocrine or paracrine loops that also
contribute to the receptor activation and uncontrolled cell
proliferation. Like the EGFR, other ErbB members have been
targeted with similar results. He et al. inhibited ErbB2 and
FLK-1 and saw suppression of Ras-transformed sarcomas in
nude mice [64]. Stonecypher et al. used the ErbB2–4

inhibitors PD168393 and PD158780 to block proliferation of
MPNST cells [60].

The tumor microenvironment

Another important consideration regarding the ability of
transformed Schwann cells to form tumors involves the
tumor microenvironment. MPNSTs
are heterogeneous
tumors: they contain neurons, perineural cells, ﬁbroblasts,
and inﬁltrating mast cells (Fig. 3). While Schwann cells that
have undergone biallelic inactivation at the Nf1 locus are
thought to make up the bulk of the tumor, haploinsufﬁcient
cells within the tumor microenvironment are believed to play
a necessary part in tumor formation and progression [65].
With loss of one Nf1 allele, mast cells experience an increase
in proliferation, survival (at least in part via increased PI3K
activity), and colony formation [66,67]. Nf1-null Schwann cells
secrete increased amounts of KitL, which recruits mast cells
[68]. Once within the tumor microenvironment, mast cells
secrete mitogens, angiogenic factors, proteases, and other
inﬂammatory elements that promote tumor formation and
progression [69]. Similar
interactions among
Schwann cells, mast cells, and other non-neoplastic cells
may exist and may explain the anti-tumor effects of anti-
histamines (ketotifen fumerate), anti-inﬂammatories (inter-
feron-a), anti-angiogenics (thalidomide,
interferon-a), and
anti-ﬁbrotic agents (perfenidone) with some NF1 patients
[70]. In addition, the local production of autocrine or paracrine
growth factors within the tumor microenvironment may
further implicate various surface receptors in cell proliferation
and tumor formation.

Concluding remarks

Our ability to effectively treat patients with NF1 should
improve with more accurate and detailed characterization of
those features that distinguish MPNST cells. That MPNST cells
acquire the EGFR with the loss of Nf1 may expand the
mechanism by which Ras directs proliferation and, in general,
how signaling molecules reciprocate an effect on upstream
cell surface receptors independent of autocrine growth
factors. Increased Ras signaling may directly or indirectly
alter the expression of other pharmacologically accessible
markers in tumor cells. These Ras-directed phenotypic
changes would provide treatment strategies not only for
NF1-related malignancy but also for a large percentage of
human tumors.
