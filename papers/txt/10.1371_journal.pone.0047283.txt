Abstract

Background:Ras GTPases mediate numerous biological processes through their ability to cycle between an inactive GDP-
bound form and an active GTP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) favor the formation of the active
Ras-GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) promote the formation of inactive Ras-GDP. Numerous studies have
established complex signaling cross-talks between Ras GTPases and other members of the superfamily of small GTPases.
GEFs were thought to play a major role in these cross-talks. However, recently GAPs were also shown to play crucial roles in
these processes. Among RasGAPs, Nf1 is of special interest. Nf1 is responsible for the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis
type I, and recent data strongly suggest that this RasGAP connects different signaling pathways.

Methodology/PrincipalFindings:In order to know if the RasGAP Nf1 might play a role in connecting Ras GTPases to other
small GTPase pathways, we systematically looked for new partners of Nf1, by performing a yeast two-hybrid screening on its
SecPH domain. LIMK2, a major kinase of the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway, was identified in this screening. We
confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and further characterized it. We also demonstrated its
specificity: the close related homolog of LIMK2, LIMK1, does not interact with the SecPH domain of Nf1. We then showed
that SecPH partially inhibits the kinase activity of LIMK2 on cofilin. Our results furthermore suggest a precise mechanism for
this inhibition: in fact, SecPH would specifically prevent LIMK2 activation by ROCK, its upstream regulator.

Conclusions/Significance: Although previous data had already connected Nf1 to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, our study
provides for the first time possible detailed molecular requirements of this involvement. Nf1/LIMK2 interaction and
inhibition allows to directly connect neurofibromatosis type I to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and provides evidence that
the RasGAP Nf1 mediates a new cross-talk between Ras and Rho signaling pathways within the superfamily of small
GTPases.

Introduction

interacts with specific downstream effectors

Ras GTPases act as molecular switches cycling between an
inactive GDP bound form and an active GTP bound form. In
response to various extracellular stimuli, the activated form of Ras
GTPases
thus
regulating many major cellular processes, such as cell proliferation
and differentiation, morphology, migration, and apoptosis. GDP/
GTP cycling is controlled by two categories of proteins. Guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the release of GDP
thus allowing the binding of GTP, whereas GTPase Ativating
Proteins (GAPs) enhance intrinsic Ras GTPase activity thus
promoting hydrolysis of GTP into GDP.

RasGEFs have been extensively studied, and their connections
with different signaling pathways have been well established [1]. In
contrast, RasGAPs have received relatively little attention and

there is less information regarding their regulation. However,
emerging pieces of evidence show that RasGAP interaction with
other partners mediates cross-talk between Ras GTPases and
other small GTPase signaling pathways. Along this line, p120
RasGAP was shown to interact with and to influence the activity of
several RhoGAPs: p190 RhoGAP, p200 RhoGAP, and DLC1
RhoGAP [2,3]. Beside p120 RasGAP, various other mammalian
RasGAPs have been identified, including neurofibromin, RASA2,
IQGAP1, IQGAP3, SYNGAP and GAPVD1 [4]. However, only
mutations in p120 RasGAP and neurofibromin result in a clinical
expression and lead to human hereditary disorders.

Neurofibromin (Nf1) is encoded by NF1 gene which has been
identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in Neurofibroma-
tosis type I. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), also known as von
Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder and

cies, and neurological disorders such as learning disabilities [5,6,7].
NF1 is due to mutations within the NF1 gene which encodes
neurofibromin, a large 2818 amino acid protein [8,9,10]. Initially,
sequence analysis of neurofibromin revealed a GAP Related
Domain (GRD) with high identity (31%) with the GAP domain of
p120RasGAP. Biochemical studies confirmed that Nf1 has Ras-
GAP activity [11,12,13]. Therefore, primary studies have focused
on Ras regulation by Nf1. Loss or mutations of Nf1 in a wide
variety of both human tumors and NF1-deficient mice result in
increased levels of active Ras-GTP and consequently activate
various Ras effectors thereby promoting cell proliferation and
differentiation [14,15]. However, recent data show that, besides
regulating Ras, Nf1 plays a critical role in other signaling
pathways. Indeed, Nf1 has been shown to be involved in the
regulation of
cAMP in human [16], mouse
[17,18,19], drosophila [20,21], and yeast [22]. On the other
hand, Nf1 was also suggested to play a role in actin cytoskeleton
remodeling.
Indeed, Nf1 was demonstrated to regulate cell
adhesion, cell motility and actin cytoskeleton reorganisation
[23,24,25]. Nf1 was shown to associate with microtubular and
microfilamentous cytoskeleton [26], and to interact with FAK
(Focal Adhesion Kinases) [27] and syndecans thus modulating
PKA-Ena/VASP pathway in the formation of
filopodia and
dendritic spine [28]. Nf1 was also shown to enhance cell motility
by regulating actin filament dynamics via the inhibition of the
Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway [29]. Furthermore, Nf1
was shown to act as a negative regulator of the Rac1/Pak1/
LIMK1/cofilin pathway independently of Ras signaling pathways
[30]. Although Nf1 involvement

pathways is now well established, most of its molecular targets
are still unknown, and the molecular mechanisms of
these
involvements remain in most cases to be elucidated.

in these different

As the RasGAP Nf1 seems to connect several signal transduc-
tion pathways, it appears as a good candidate to link Ras GTPases
to other small GTPase pathways. In this context, we decided to
systematically look for new partners of Nf1 by performing a two-
hybrid screening. We focused on a specific domain of Nf1, SecPH.
We chose this domain as it appeared well appropriate for our
study. Firstly, Sec and PH domains are well known to mediate
protein-protein interactions. Secondly, Nf1 SecPH 3D structure
has been resolved revealing a well defined structure per
se
[31].Thirdly, SecPH flanks the GRD of Nf1 and could regulate
its activity in an allosteric way. Finally, we already demonstrated in
yeast
this domain is able to mediate protein-protein
interactions [32].

Our two-hybrid screening allowed us to identify LIMK2 as a
partner of Nf1-SecPH. LIMK2 is a major kinase in the Rho/
ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway. This pathway plays a major
role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. We confirmed the
interaction between Nf1-SecPH and LIMK2 by coimmunopreci-
pitation experiments and dissected the molecular requirements of
this interaction. From a functional point of view, our data showed
that SecPH is an inhibitor of LIMK2: in the presence of SecPH,
LIMK2 phosphorylates less efficiently its substrate cofilin. Our
experiments also strongly suggested that SecPH interferes with
LIMK2 activation by ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming
protein kinase): SecPH specifically prevents LIMK2 phosphory-
lation by this upstream kinase. Our findings therefore propose a
molecular explanation for the connection between Nf1 and actin

between Ras and Rho signaling pathways.

Results

Two-hybrid screening results

In an effort to identify a connection between Ras GTPases and
other small GTPases via the RasGAP Nf1, we decided to
systematically look for new partners of the RasGAP Nf1. In this
purpose, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human
fetal brain cDNA library on a newly characterized domain of Nf1,
SecPH [31] (Figure 1A). This screening was particularly successful
as we could test 270 million of
interactions, which means a
recovery of the library of 70 times for a final number of 1464
positive candidates. Among these 1464 candidates, we identified
LIMK2 (Figure 1B).

LIMK2 is a serine threonine kinase playing a major role in actin
cytoskeleton dynamics via the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin sig-
naling pathway. LIMK2, and its sole homolog LIMK1, have a
unique organization of
signaling domains, with two amino-
terminal LIM domains (each containing double zinc finger motifs),
adjacent PDZ and serine/proline (SP)-rich regions, followed by a
carboxy-terminal kinase domain. Upon their activation by
ROCK, LIMK2 and LIMK1 phosphorylate cofilin, resulting in
its inactivation. Cofilin is a member of ADF (actin depolymerizing
factor) family. It promotes actin depolymerization at pointed ends
and severes long actin filaments, which leads to a fast turnover of
actin filaments [33,34]. By inhibiting cofilin, LIMK2 and LIMK1
play a central role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton.

LIMK2 interacts with the SecPH domain of Nf1

To validate the interaction found by our two-hybrid screening
between SecPH and LIMK2 (Figure 1B), we performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. On the one hand LIMK2
was tagged by a HA epitope, on the other hand SecPH was tagged
with a flag epitope. HEK-293 cells were cotransfected by LIMK2
and SecPH or its parental empty plasmid. Anti-flag immunopre-
cipitations were performed. Lysates and eluates were subjected to
western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1C, LIMK2 specifically
coimmunoprecipitated with SecPH. Indeed, no LIMK2 was
detected in the anti-flag-immunoprecipitates using cells transfected
with the parental empty plasmid of SecPH (p3XFlag). Therefore,
in transfected HEK293 cells, LIMK2 specifically interacts with
SecPH.

To further study the interaction between LIMK2 and SecPH,
recombinant 6His-SecPH was incubated with immunoprecipitated
HA-LIMK2 for a complex formation assay. As
shown in
Figure 1D, recombinant 6His-SecPH is co-purified with immu-
noprecipitated HA-LIMK2.

SecPH does not interact with LIMK2 close related
homolog, LIMK1

LIMK2 has a sole homolog, LIMK1. They share 50% identity.
In our two-hybrid screening, we could identify LIMK2 but not
LIMK1. As LIMK1 and LIMK2 are very close we wondered if the
SecPH-LIMK2 interaction could be conserved with LIMK1.

Using the two-hybrid system, we could detect no interaction

between LIMK1 and SecPH (Figure 1B).

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments on lysates of cells
cotransfected with SecPH and LIMK1, no interaction could
either be detected (Figure 1C).

In conclusion, SecPH binds to LIMK2 but not to its related

homolog LIMK1.

LIMK2 interacts with endogenous Nf1

We have shown that LIMK2 is able to interact with SecPH, a
domain of Nf1. We wondered if this interaction was still observed
with the full length protein Nf1.

To address this point, we first transfected HEK-293 cells, which
naturally express Nf1, with HA-LIMK2, and proceeded to anti-
HA immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure 1E, immunopre-
cipitated HA-LIMK2 interacts specifically with endogenous Nf1.
We then immunoprecipitated endogenous Nf1 from HEK-293
lysed cells with anti-Nf1 antibodies coupled to sepharose beads
and checked for endogenous LIMK2 interaction. As shown in
Figure 1F, we could detect a specific band of endogenous LIMK2
interacting with endogenous Nf1.

To further dissect

Domains of LIMK2 involved in its interaction with SecPH
the regions of LIMK2 involved in its
interaction with SecPH, different domains of LIMK2 were tested
for their abilities
to coimmunoprecipitate with SecPH. Five
domains of LIMK2 were tested (Figure 1G - Top): LIM (the N-
terminal extremity of LIMK2 containing 2 LIM domains), PDZ,
SP, PDZ/SP, and KIN (the C-terminal domain of LIMK2
comprising the kinase domain).

As shown in Figure 1G - Bottom, LIM domain is unable to
interact with SecPH, neither PDZ nor SP domains. In contrast,
KIN and PDZ/SP domains are able to interact with SecPH. It is
quite intriguing that SecPH interacts with the double domain
PDZ/SP but not with one of these single domains PDZ or SP, this
may be explained by conformational requirements.

Therefore, SecPH interacts with LIMK2 via two domains: the

kinase and the PDZ/SP domains.

SecPH affects LIMK2 induced formation of actin stress
fibers

LIMK2 belongs to the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin signal
transduction pathway and phosphorylates cofilin. Once phosphor-
ylated, cofilin, an actin depolymerisation factor, is then no longer
able to depolymerise actin, and an accumulation of stress fibers is
observed. Using NF1 siRNA, Ozawa et al. have shown that Nf1 is
an inhibitor of this pathway [29]. However, they provided no
molecular explanation for this phenomenon. Our new data have
prompted us to test if the target of Nf1 in the Rho/ROCK/
LIMK2/cofilin pathway could be LIMK2.

We first focused our attention on actin cytoskeleton organisation
driven by this pathway by performing immunofluorescence
experiments on fixed intact cells.

HeLa cells were cotransfected with HA-LIMK2 and SecPH or
with HA-LIMK2 and the parental empty plasmid of SecPH. The
actin filaments were visualized by phalloidin staining. As
previously observed [35], expression of LIMK2 enhanced the
formation of actin stress fibers compared to mock-transfected cells,
a consequence of cofilin inactivation by LIMK2 (Figure 2A- Left
and Middle pannels). When SecPH was cotransfected with
LIMK2, there was a marked decrease in the accumulation of
actin stress fibers (Figure 2A – Right and Middle pannels). These
data suggest that SecPH affects actin stress fiber formation due to
LIMK2 overexpression.

SecPH partially inhibits cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK2
We then decided to test directly SecPH activity on LIMK2 by
measuring LIMK2 kinase activity on cofilin in vitro in the presence
or not of SecPH.

Cells were cotransfected by LIMK2 and either SecPH or
Galectin-3, a non-specific flag-tagged protein control. Galectin-3 is

Ras and Rho Cross-Talk via Nf1 and LIMK2

a member of the lectin family which binds beta-galactoside [36].
We measured the kinase activity of
the anti-HA-LIMK2
immunoprecipitates using recombinant GST-cofilin as a substrate.
As shown in Figure 2B, anti-HA immunoprecipitate from cells
cotransfected with LIMK2 and SecPH showed a slight but
significant and reproducible decrease of around 20% in the
intensity of phospho-cofilin (P-cofilin) compared with anti-HA
immunoprecipitate from cells cotransfected with LIMK2 and the
non-specific protein control Galectin-3. These data are statistically
significant as p = 0.0289 (* p,0.05).

These results

suggest

that SecPH partially inhibits cofilin

phosphorylation by LIMK2.

SecPH dose dependent inhibition of cofilin
phosphorylation by LIMK2

To further characterize SecPH inhibition of cofilin phosphor-
ylation by LIMK2, we repeated the kinase assay on cofilin, but this
time we incubated anti-HA-LIMK2 immunoprecipitate with
increasing amounts of
immunoprecipitated SecPH. Cells were
transfected on one hand with LIMK2 and on the other hand with
SecPH or the non-specific protein control Galectin-3. SecPH and
Galectin-3 were immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysates
with anti-flag beads, and then eluted from the beads with flag
peptide. For the kinase assay, immunoprecipitated HA-LIMK2
and GST-cofilin were used, in the presence of increasing amounts
of eluted SecPH or Galectin-3.

As shown in Figure 2C, we observed a dose-dependent response
of
cofilin phosphorylation upon SecPH addition, whereas
Galectin-3 addition had no influence on cofilin phosphorylation.
The more SecPH was added, the less P-cofilin was observed.
Therefore, the more SecPH was added, the more LIMK2 kinase
activity on cofilin was inhibited.

SecPH inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation is specific to
LIMK2

We already demonstrated that SecPH specifically interacts with
LIMK2 and not with its close related homolog LIMK1 (Figures 1B
and 1C). In order to make sure that SecPH activity on cofilin
phosphorylation in vitro specifically went through LIMK2, and not
through its close related homolog, LIMK1, we repeated the kinase
assay on GST-cofilin with HA-LIMK1 immunoprecipitate in the
presence of increasing amounts of immunoprecipitated SecPH. It
appeared that SecPH has no effect on LIMK1 kinase activity on
cofilin (Figure 2D).

SecPH inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK2
requires ROCK activation of LIMK2

To deepen our understanding of SecPH inhibition on cofilin
phosphorylation by LIMK2, we took advantage of two mutants of
LIMK2 at Threonin 505. Consequently to T505 phosphorylation
by ROCK, LIMK2 is activated and phosphorylates cofilin. The
two mutants used in this study were LIMK2-T505A, which is
inactive, and LIMK2-T505EE, which is constitutively active [35].
First, we checked if these two mutants were still able to interact
with SecPH. Cells were cotransfected with HA-LIMK2 WT,
LIMK2-TA or LIMK2-TEE and with flag-SecPH. Anti-flag
immunoprecipitations were performed. As depicted in Figure 3A,
SecPH interacts with wild-type LIMK2, as well as with LIMK2-
TA and LIMK2-TEE. We also checked if these two mutants were
still able to interact with endogenous Nf1. Cells were transfected
with either HA-LIMK2-WT, or LIMK2-TA or LIMK2-TEE.
Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed. As shown in
Figure 3B, the two mutants interact with endogenous Nf1.

activity of the different anti-HA-LIMK2 immunoprecipitates using
GST-cofilin as a substrate. P-cofilin signal was very weak with the
inactive LIMK2-TA and particularly intense with the constitu-
tively active LIMK2-TEE (Figure 3C). These results are in good
accordance with data from the literature [35]. Neither of these P-
cofilin signals was modulated by SecPH (Figure 3C). These results
are not so surprising for P-cofilin produced by LIMK2-TA,
considering the mutant has a weak activity. SecPH was
interestingly unable to inhibit cofilin phosphorylation by the
constitutively active LIMK2-TEE whereas it can still interact with
it (Figure 3A).

As

the constitutively active mutant LIMK2-TEE bypasses
ROCK activation of LIMK2, these results suggest that SecPH
might act upstream from LIMK2 and that its inhibitory effect on
cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK2 might require the transient
activation of LIMK2 by ROCK.

SecPH inhibits LIMK2 phosphorylation of cofilin by
preventing ROCK activation of LIMK2

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of SecPH inhibition
of cofilin phosphorylation by ROCK activated LIMK2, we
postulated that SecPH might prevent LIMK2 from interacting
with ROCK. To check this hypothesis, we cotransfected cells with
HA-LIMK2, cMyc-ROCK1 and flag-SecPH or its empty parental
plasmid. We then performed HA-immunoprecipitations. In these
conditions, ROCK1 interacts with LIMK2 in the absence as well
as in the presence of SecPH (Figure 4A). Therefore, SecPH does
not disturb the interaction between ROCK1 and LIMK2.

Another attractive hypothesis is that SecPH might prevent the

T505 phosphorylation of LIMK2 by ROCK.

This hypothesis was in accordance with 32P gels from the
LIMK2 kinase assay on cofilin described in Figure 2B. Indeed, a
slower mobility band compared to cofilin could be observed on 32P
labeled gels. This band corresponded to LIMK2 molecular weight.
So in this assay, we could also observe HA-immunoprecipitated
LIMK2 phosphorylation. The intensity of LIMK2 phosphorylated
band was decreased in the presence of SecPH (Figure 4B)
indicating that SecPH might affect LIMK2 phosphorylation.

In order to know if this phosphorylation was mediated by
ROCK activity on T505 of LIMK2, and was not due to LIMK2
autophosphorylation, we used anti-P-LIMK1 (T508)/LIMK2
in conditions where cells were
(T505) antibodies. However,
transfected with LIMK2,
this antibody appeared to be non
specific for P-LIMK2 (T505) detection. Indeed, a signal could be
observed with the LIMK2-T505A mutant on lysate and even on
LIMK2-T505A immunoprecipitate. To circumvent this problem,
we cotransfected cells with LIMK2 and ROCK1,
in order to
enhance LIMK2-T505 phosphorylation. In these conditions, no
signal was observed for LIMK2-T505A mutant (Figure 4D).

In these conditions i.e. when ROCK1 was cotransfected with
LIMK2, SecPH was still able to inhibit cofilin phosphorylation by
LIMK2, although HA-LIMK2 immunoprecipitates showed an
increased kinase activity on cofilin (Figure 4C).

When cells were cotransfected with ROCK1, LIMK2 and
SecPH, the signal detected with anti-phosphoT505 antibodies was
significantly decreased compared to cells cotransfected with
ROCK1, LIMK2 and a non-specific control protein, Galectin-3

T505 phosphorylation by ROCK1.

also the case for MLC. In these conditions, MLC phosphorylation
did not seem to be affected by SecPH (Figure 5A).

Altogether these data suggest that SecPH inhibition of cofilin
phosphorylation by LIMK2 is due to SecPH inhibition of LIMK2
phosphorylation and therefore activation by ROCK1.

SecPH affects ROCK kinase activity specifically with
respect to LIMK2

Our results suggest that SecPH affects LIMK2 phosphorylation
by ROCK. We next wondered if SecPH affects ROCK kinase
activity in general or specifically with respect to LIMK2. In this
purpose, we studied the kinase activity of ROCK on Myosin Light
Chain (MLC), another ROCK substrate, in the presence or in the
absence of SecPH.

First, we repeated our kinase assay on HA-LIMK2 immuno-
precipitates in the presence of SecPH or Galectin-3 as described in
Figure 2B but we added MLC in the kinase reaction mixture.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 4B, we know that in this assay, SecPH
inhibits LIMK2 phosphorylation and we wanted to know if it was

Then, we transfected cells with c-Myc-ROCK1 and SecPH or
Galectin-3. We measured the kinase activity of the anti-c-Myc
immunoprecipitates but this time by using recombinant LIMK2 or
MLC as substrates. As shown in Figure 5B, SecPH seemed to have
no influence on MLC phosphorylation by ROCK1. In this
experiment, SecPH inhibition of
the recombinant LIMK2
phosphorylation was faint but this can be explained by the fact
that the recombinant LIMK2 we used was already activated and
phosphorylated. It has also to be noted that ROCK1 autopho-
sphorylated during the assay and that SecPH did not seem either
to inhibit this phosphorylation.

Altogether,

these results

suggest

that SecPH inhibition of

ROCK kinase activity is specific to LIMK2.

Discussion

The human superfamily of small GTPases presents more than
150 members. Ras GTPases are the founding members of this
family, which is divided into five main branches: Ras, Rho, Rab,

signal

In order to find new cross-talks between Ras GTPases and other
small GTPases, we decided to focus on the RasGAP Nf1, which
was already shown to integrate several
transduction
pathways. By a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified LIMK2
as a new partner of the SecPH domain of Nf1. LIMK2 is a major
kinase of
the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway. Upon
activation by ROCK, LIMK2 phosphorylates cofilin, resulting
in its inactivation. Cofilin is a member of
the ADF (actin
depolymerizing factor) family. It promotes actin depolymerization
at pointed ends and severes long actin filaments, which leads to a
fast turnover of actin filaments [33,34]. By inhibiting cofilin,
LIMK2 plays a central role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton
reorganisation and thereby contributes to diverse cellular functions
such as cell motility, morphogenesis, division, differentiation,
apoptosis, neurite extension and oncogenesis.

We confirmed the interaction between LIMK2 and the SecPH
domain of NF1 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Our
results also suggest a molecular mechanism explaining the
physiological relevance of this interaction. Indeed, by interacting
with LIMK2, Nf1, via its SecPH domain, seems able to inhibit
LIMK2 activation by ROCK and its subsequent activity on
cofilin.

Our results are in accordance with data from a recent
proteomic study on ROCK, whose goal was to identify new
substrates of this kinase [40]. Nf1 and LIMK2 were found to be
part of the ROCK complexome.

Our findings are also in good agreement with previous data
from Ozawa et al. [29], who showed that Nf1 regulated actin
cytoskeleton reorganization by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK/
LIMK2/cofilin pathway. They performed NF1 siRNA experi-
ments on HeLa cells and observed an excessive actin stress fiber
formation and an increase of P-cofilin due to LIMK2. However,
they could not establish a direct molecular link between Nf1 and
this pathway. Our data indicate that this missing link might be the
interaction between LIMK2 and the SecPH domain of Nf1,
although we cannot exclude another partner as we worked on
immunoprecipitated and not recombinant proteins. We also went
further into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of Nf1
inhibition of
the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway by
suggesting that Nf1-SecPH might prevent LIMK2 activation by
ROCK and therefore prevent LIMK2 phosphorylation and
inhibition of cofilin. SecPH inhibition of ROCK kinase activity
seems to be specific to LIMK2, as phosphorylation of another
ROCK substrate, Myosin Light Chain, is not affected by SecPH.
It would be very interesting to go deeper into the understanding of
the mechanistics of this process. Our study raised two hypotheses
(Figure 6)
(1) we have shown that SecPH does not disrupt
LIMK2/ROCK interaction (Figure 4A), however when SecPH
binds to LIMK2, a steric hindrance might prevent ROCK from
accessing its target residue, Thr505 of LIMK2 (2) when SecPH
and ROCK bind to LIMK2, they get nearby, then the PH domain
of SecPH might interact with the kinase domain of ROCK and
inhibit it, thereby mimicking the action of the PH domain of
ROCK in its inactive closed conformation. However, as we
showed that SecPH has no intrinsic influence on ROCK kinase
activity in general, this inhibition would specifically occur when
ROCK and SecPH simultaneously interact with LIMK2. Further
studies are currently in progress to bring an answer to these
intriguing mechanistics.

:

Our results also corroborate previous data suggesting a role of

Nf1 in actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

First of all, many of the clinical features of Neurofibromatosis
type I, such as neurofibroma and glioma formation as well as
learning disabilities, may be related to actin cytoskeletal organi-

Same as Figure 2B, except 0.5 mg of MLC were added in the kinase

Ran and Arf. Acting as molecular binary switches, these small
GTPases regulate many major biological processes, such as cell
cycle progression, cell survival, actin cytoskeleton organization,
cell polarity and movement, and vesicular and nuclear transport.
Extensive cross-talks between these different small GTPases have
been demonstrated [1,37,38,39].

Ras and Rho Cross-Talk via Nf1 and LIMK2

Figure 6. Schematic representation of our findings: A molecular connection between neurofibromin and the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/
cofilin pathway. A. Upon Rho activation via binding to its RBD (Rho Binding domain), ROCK activates LIMK2 by phosphorylation at its Thr505.
Activated LIMK2 will then phosphorylate cofilin on its Ser3, resulting in its inhibition. An invasive phenotype is then observed with accumulation of
actin stress fibers. B. SecPH, a new inhibitor of this Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway. By interacting with LIMK2, SecPH prevents ROCK activation of
LIMK2. Our data raises two possible hypotheses for this inhibition of ROCK activation of LIMK2 by SecPH: (1) by steric hindrance, SecPH hides Thr505
of LIMK2 from ROCK accessibility, (2) the PH domain of SecPH substitutes to the PH domain of ROCK by inhibiting the kinase activity of ROCK; this
inhibition would specifically occur when ROCK and SecPH are simultaneously bound to LIMK2.

sation defect.
Indeed, neurofibromas are composed of an
aggregation of multiple cell types and they are infiltrated by
surrounding hypermotile Nf1+/2 mast cells
(which secrete
mediators that remodel
the extracellular matrix and initiate
angiogenesis). Both features are related to the deregulation of the
actin cytoskeleton. Beyond the tumorigenic symptoms, NF1
patients frequently exhibit cognitive deficits. Along this line,
regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the Rho/
ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway have been shown to play a role in
neuronal cell development [41,42].

Secondly, enhanced migration and motility as well as abnormal
actin cytoskeleton organization were observed in Nf1 deficient or
haploinsufficient Schwann cells,
and osteoclasts
[43,44,45,46]

astrocytes

Finally, in addition to the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin path-
way, several other specific signaling pathways were identified to
connect Nf1 to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. NF1 overexpression
was shown to induce an increase in the expression levels of the
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) [24]. A direct interaction between
Nf1 and FAK has also been described [27], suggesting a role of
Nf1 in cell adhesion. Moreover, by interacting with syndecan-2,
another adhesion protein, Nf1 mediates the activation of PKA,
which phosphorylates
two actin-associated proteins Ena and
VASP, thus promoting actin polymerisation for the formation of
filopodia and dendritic spines [28]. In addition to its negative

regulation of the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin pathway [29], Nf1
also independently negatively regulates the Rac1/Pak1/LIMK1/
cofilin pathway [30]. In both cases, NF1 depletion leads to an
increased phosphorylation and consequently inhibition of cofilin,
thus promoting actin stress fiber formation. Along the same line,
the effect of the drug schweinfurthin A is most probably related to
the role of Nf1 in the Rho/ROCK/LIMK2 pathway [47].
Recently, Nf1 was shown to activate Rho/ROCK/MLC pathway
via cAMP/PKA signaling. These latter results seem in contradic-
tion with the previous data described above and our findings, but
can be easily reconciliated. Indeed, they were obtained specifically
in neurons of the central nervous system and not in neurons of the
peripheral nervous system, therefore they appear to be cell type
specific [48].

From a signal transduction point of view, we identified a new
cross-talk between Ras GTPases and another small GTPase,
namely between Ras and RhoA.

About twenty years ago, several studies already suggested cross-
talks between Ras and Rho signaling pathways [37,49,50]. The
preliminary ideas limiting Ras to cell proliferation and Rho to
actin cytoskeleton reorganization and considering these pathways
as linear and disconnected became quickly obsolete. A complex
scheme interconnecting the different small GTPase pathways was
more accurate. Different approaches,
sometimes combined,
allowed to establish these connections: (i) the use of dominant

involved in these connections.

negative and constitutively active versions of small GTPases
(created through specific amino acid substitution); (ii) the use of
transient activation or chemical drugs to stimulate or inhibit
upstream regulators of small GTPases; (iii) more recently the use of
RNAi and gene knockout models. Although these studies brought
invaluable data on cross-talks between Ras and Rho, mainly via
Rac, they suffered from a lack of molecular data. Indeed, most of
the time they did not identify precisely the different proteins or the
biochemical mechanisms
In
parallel, studies based on GEFs and GAPs, the main regulators
of
small GTPases, also established connections between the
different small GTPases. Sequence analysis showed that some
GEFs, and in a lower extent a few GAPs, possess GEF or GAP
domains for other small GTPases. By interacting with various
specific partners, GAPs or GEFs appear to trigger different cell
responses. As an example, when the GEF SOS is in complex with
Grb2, it activates Ras, whereas when it is in complex with Eps8, it
activates Rac [1,51]. Special interest has focused on p120RasGAP,
the first RasGAP identified. p120RasGAP was found to interact
with several RhoGAPs, triggering different cell responses accord-
ing to which RhoGAP is involved. p120RasGAP was found to
interact with p190RhoGAP [49,52]. It appears to recruit it to the
cell periphery where it inhibits Rho [53]. p120RasGAP was also
found to interact with p200RhoGAP. This interaction is required
for p200RhoGAP to activate Ras, promoting cell growth and
transformation [54]. Finally, p120RasGAP was found to interact
with the DLC1 RhoGAP thereby inhibiting its GAP activity
towards RhoA and resulting in RhoA activation [3].

In our present study, the RasGAP Nf1 does not interact with a
RhoGAP but with a downstream effector of RhoA, LIMK2. By
interacting with the SecPH domain of Nf1 Ras GAP, LIMK2
partially loses its kinase activity on cofilin. We have shown that this
process is specific to LIMK2. Nf1 RasGAP-SecPH has no effect on
LIMK1, the close related homolog of LIMK2. One may think
that, in these conditions, cofilin may still be inactivated by LIMK1.
However, another domain of
its pre-GAP
region, has been shown to negatively regulate the Rac1/Pak1/
LIMK1/cofilin pathway [30]. So, via two of its domains, the
RasGAP Nf1 may coordinate the inhibition of both LIM kinases
shutting down their activity on cofilin. The regulation of these two
branches of the pathway by two independent domains suggests an
independent regulation for these processes.

the RasGAP Nf1,

In conclusion, our study suggests a new connection into the
complex network of small GTPase signaling. The RasGAP Nf1
might regulate the activity of a downstream effector of RhoA. Our
results bring unprecedented details of the molecular mechanism
that might be involved in this connection. Further characterization
of the interactome of the different members of this network will
certainly establish new cross-talks between small GTPases. A
special effort on the molecular requirements of these interactions is
needed for a better understanding of the role and the intercon-
nections between each member in this network.

Two-hybrid screening

The two-hybrid system used was obtained from Clontech (Yeast
Matchmaker). All media, buffers and methods used for yeast cells
were adapted from previously described procedures [55,56] and
from the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. pBTM116-SecPH
encoding the SecPH domain of Nf1 fused in N-terminus to the
LexA DNA-binding protein was transformed into the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae strain L40 (MATa, his3D200, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ade2,
LYS::(lexAop)4-HIS, URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ. The human foetal brain

was purchased from Clontech. It contained 3.5 millions of
independent clones. After mating of the two strains, 270 millions
of
interactions were tested and plated on restricted medium
lacking leucin, tryptophan and histidin. Growing colonies were
restreaked and tested for b-galactosidase activity, yielding 1464
positive clones that were collected and stored at 280uC in
glycerol. 173 of these clones were identified by PCR-amplifying
the corresponding prey fragments and sequencing them. Two of
these clones encoded the full length LIMK2.

Cell culture and transfection

Kinase assay

HEK-293 (ATCC, CRL1573) and HeLa cells (ATCC, CCL-2)
were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37uC in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells
were transiently transfected with 10 ug of plasmid/100-mm dish
with Lipofectamine LTX according to manufacter’s recommen-
dations. Experiments were performed 24 h to 48 h after transfec-
tion.

Immunoprecipitation

HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with expression
plasmids as described above, and cultured for 24 to 48 h. Cells
were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5,
100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaF,
10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 mM p-
nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mM b-glycerophosphate, 10 mg/ml
aprotinin, 0.05 mg/ml okaidic acid, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM
PMSF), and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the
supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4uC either with anti-HA
affinity gel for HA-LIMK2 or its derivatives or with anti-flag M2
affinity gel for SecPH and Galectin-3 or with anti-Nf1 affinity gel
for endogenous Nf1. Beads were washed five times with lysis
buffer. HA-LIMK2 or its derivatives and Nf1 were eluted by
Laemmli sample buffer and flag-SecPH or flag-Galectin-3 was
eluted by incubating the beads for 30 minutes on ice with 0.2 mg/
ml of the flag peptide.

6His-SecPH purification

6His-SecPH was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET14
plasmid. The protein was purified from the bacterial extract by
using TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech). Elution was
performed with 100 mM imidazole. Protein concentration was
measured by using Bradford method.

To test the interaction between 6His-SecPH and LIMK2, HA-
LIMK2 was immunoprecipitated as described in the previous
section. Immunoprecipitated beads were then incubated with
6His-SecPH (12 mg) in lysis buffer for 2 hours, and further washed
three times with lysis buffer, and then eluted by Laemmli sample
buffer. For the negative control, the anti-HA immunoprecipitation
was performed on lysates of HEK-293 cells transfected with the
pcDNA3 empty plasmid (parental plasmid of HA-LIMK2).

incubated for 20 min at 30uC in 22 ml of kinase buffer containing
50 mM ATP, 5 mCi of c[32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 2.5 mg of
GST-fused cofilin. The reaction was
terminated by heating
5 minutes at 90uC in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then
