these sequences are recognized as functional en-
hancers, yet actively repressed.

To test the functionality of STARR-seq en-
hancers when integrated into the genome, we cre-
ated 22 stable S2 cell lines each carrying stably
integrated luciferase reporter constructs with an
enhancer (15 lines) or a negative fragment (fig.
S21). All enhancers, including three out of three
closed enhancers, showed strong luciferase activ-
ity, whereas none of the negative controls did (Fig.
3C and fig. S21). For all, the luciferase activity was
constant over a course of 4 weeks, measured 3, 5,
and 7 weeks after integration (fig. S21). The ac-
tivity of the three closed enhancers suggests that
their endogenous inactive state might depend on
the genomic context and/or on regulatory activities
in S2 precursor cells. This shows that enhancers
identified by ectopic assays, such as STARR-seq,
can function when integrated into a chromosomal
context, even if they are silenced endogenously.

We next applied STARR-seq to Drosophila
adult ovarian somatic cells [OSCs (21)] and iden-
tified a comparable number of enhancers (4682;
P ≤ 0.001, binomial test; FDR = 0.2%) with
similar characteristics (figs. S4B; S5B; S6, C to
E; S12D; S13, C and D; and S22, A to C). Out
of 8659 enhancers found in S2 cells or OSCs,
5404 (62.4%) changed at least twofold and 2138
(24.7%) at least fourfold between both cell types
(Fig. 4A, and figs. S23 and S24, A and D), and
luciferase assays confirmed these differences quan-
titatively (r = 0.85; fig. S24, B and C). Changes
in enhancer strengths between the two cell types
were reflected in the differential mRNA abun-
dance (fig. S25) of the flanking genes (Fig. 4, B
and C, and fig. S26): 74% of all enhancers near
genes that are fourfold up-regulated in S2 cells
appear stronger in S2 cells, whereas only 16% ap-
pear stronger in OSCs and vice versa (66% ver-
sus 19%). This establishes a direct link between
quantitative differences in genome-wide enhanc-
er strengths and differential gene expression. Up
to 19% of cell type–specific enhancers were ac-
cessible in the cell-type in which they were not
active (fig. S27). We also observed 514 genes for
which individual enhancers changed more than
twofold between cell types, whereas the sum of
enhancer activities and the gene expression levels
remained constant (<twofold change; fig. S28).
As OSCs have been derived from adult
Drosophila ovaries and retained marker gene
expression and other functional aspects of their
in vivo counterparts (21), we assessed the activity
of 13 OSC STARR-seq enhancers in ovaries of
transgenic flies with site-specifically integrated
transcriptional reporter constructs. In these flies,
85% (11 out of 13) of the enhancers but none of five
control regions were active (Fig. 4D and fig. S29).
Here, we present STARR-seq, which com-
plements ChIP-seq and DHS-seq as the third prin-
cipal method to study transcriptional regulatory
elements in entire genomes. It is unique in its ability
to assess enhancer strengths quantitatively and to
discover regulatory elements directly based on their
ability to enhance transcription, even when silenced

endogenously. Applied to two Drosophila cell types,
it revealed thousands of cell type–specific en-
hancers with a broad range of strengths and pro-
vided the first genome-wide quantitative enhancer
activity maps in any organism. STARR-seq is
widely applicable to screening arbitrary sources of
DNA in any cell type or tissue that allow the ef-
ficient introduction of reporter constructs (e.g., by
plasmid transfection). This includes human HeLa
cells, for which we confirm the quantitative nature
of STARR-seq and its ability to identify enhancers
that function in luciferase assays independent of
their chromatin states and, thus, more reliably than
previous methods (figs. S30 and S31). STARR-seq
should be widely applied to many cell types across
organisms to annotate cell type–specific gene reg-
ulatory elements and functionally assess noncoding
mutations.

We report genomic analysis of 300 meningiomas, the most common primary brain tumors, leading to the
discovery of mutations in TRAF7, a proapoptotic E3 ubiquitin ligase, in nearly one-fourth of all
meningiomas. Mutations in TRAF7 commonly occurred with a recurrent mutation (K409Q) in KLF4, a
transcription factor known for its role in inducing pluripotency, or with AKT1E17K, a mutation known to
activate the PI3K pathway. SMO mutations, which activate Hedgehog signaling, were identified in ~5% of
non-NF2 mutant meningiomas. These non-NF2 meningiomas were clinically distinctive—nearly always
benign, with chromosomal stability, and originating from the medial skull base. In contrast, meningiomas
with mutant NF2 and/or chromosome 22 loss were more likely to be atypical, showing genomic instability,
and localizing to the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Collectively, these findings identify distinct
meningioma subtypes, suggesting avenues for targeted therapeutics.

Meningiomas, arising from the meninges

of the central nervous system, are the
most common primary brain tumors,

with a prevalence of ~170,000 cases in the United
States (1). Although most are histologically clas-
sified as benign (grade I), about 10% represent

atypical (grade II) or anaplastic (grade III) forms.
Meningiomas frequently invade surrounding brain
and critical neurovascular structures, often causing
neurological deficits and requiring surgical inter-
vention. Loss of Neurofibromin 2 (merlin, NF2) is
found in 40 to 60% of sporadic meningiomas (2),
but the genetic architecture of the remainder remains
obscure, limiting options for the development of
rational therapies.

To comprehensively characterize the genomics
of meningioma and to gain further insight into
molecular mechanisms of tumor formation, we
performed genome-wide genotyping and exome
sequencing (average depth of coverage 255-fold)
of 50 previously nonirradiated grade I (n = 39)
and grade II (n = 11) meningiomas and matched
normal DNA (3) (table S1). For the meningiomas
in which matching blood samples were available
(n = 39), the mean number of protein-altering
somatic mutations was 7.2 (range 1 to 15), a con-
siderably smaller number compared with ma-
lignant tumors (table S2). We next searched for
genes with significantly more somatic mutations
than expected by chance (fig. S1). Besides NF2,
we identified increased mutation burden in TNF
receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7), Krupple-
like factor 4 (KLF4), v-akt murine thymoma viral
oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), and Smoothened,
frizzled family receptor (SMO) (as a group, referred
to as non-NF2 mutant hereafter) (Fig. 1). Mutations
in these genes were mutually exclusive of NF2
mutations. In addition, we identified single muta-

tions in genes previously reported to play a role
in other neoplasias, including CREBBP, PIK3CA
(R108H variant), PIK3R1 (deletion p.306-307), and
BRCA1 as well as two SMARCB1 mutations, which
coexisted with NF2 loss and have previously been
reported in meningiomas (4) (table S3).

We next performed targeted resequencing of
these top five genes, along with chromosome 22
copy-number analysis, in an independent set of
250 unradiated meningiomas (204 grade I and
46 high-grade meningiomas) (fig. S2). In the com-
bined analysis of 300 meningiomas, we identi-
fied coding mutations in one of these five genes
and/or evidence for chromosome 22 loss in 237
(79%) (Fig. 2A and table S3). NF2 mutations
were present in 108 (36%). TRAF7 mutations,
which were always exclusive of NF2 mutations
−17
[mutual exclusivity P value (Pme) = 2.55 × 10
(5)], were observed in nearly one-fourth of the
meningiomas examined (n = 72). TRAF7 is a
proapoptotic N-terminal RING and zinc finger

domain protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activ-
ity that contains seven WD40 repeats in its C
terminus (6). TRAF7 interacts with several mol-
ecules, such as MEKK3, through these WD40
repeats, affects multiple signaling pathways, in-
cluding NF-kB, and targets ubiquitination of
proteins including c-FLIP, an antiapoptotic mol-
ecule (7). It is notable that 67 of the 72 TRAF7
mutations, including 15 recurrent mutations, all
map to the WD40 domains (Fig. 2B).

In the transcription factor KLF4, we identi-
fied a recurrent K409Q mutation, which almost
always co-occurred with TRAF7 mutations [n =
31; co-occurrence P value (Pco) = 2.50 × 10−20]
and were exclusive of NF2 mutations (Pme =
−7). KLF4 is expressed in meningiomas
3.77 × 10
(fig. S3). KLF4 regulates differentiation of sev-
eral cell types and is best known as one of four
genes that together promote reprogramming of
differentiated somatic cells into pluripotent stem
cells (8). Deletion of the KLF4 DNA binding

domain blocks differentiation and induces self-
renewal in hematopoietic cells (9). The recur-
rently mutated KLF4 residue, K409, lies within
the first zinc finger and makes direct DNA con-
tact in the major groove of the DNA binding motif
(9) (Fig. 2C and fig. S4).

The known neoplasia-related recurrent muta-
tion, AKT1E17K, was identified in 38 meningiomas.
Although the AKT1E17K mutation co-occurred with
TRAF7 mutations in 25 of the 38 tumors (Pco =
3.90 × 10−9), it was exclusive of the KLF4K409Q
(Pme = 1.18 × 10−2) and NF2 mutations, except
in one case (Pme = 2.70 × 10−7). The AKT1E17K
mutation has been shown to activate PI3K/AKT

signaling (10) and was readily detectable by im-
munohistochemistry using an antibody specific for
this mutation (fig. S3).

Finally, in 11 tumors, we identified mutations
in SMO, which is expressed in meningiomas
(fig. S5). These mutations include a recurrent
L412F variant in seven meningiomas and a pre-
viously reported W535L mutation, which has been
shown to result in activation of Hedgehog sig-
naling in basal cell carcinoma (11). Eight of these
SMO mutations were mutually exclusive of mu-
tations in the other four genes (Pme = 1.24 × 10−2).
We next evaluated chromosomal instability.
Chromosome 22 loss, observed in 149 tumors,

was the most common event and was strongly
associated with the presence of coding NF2
mutations (Pco = 1.32 × 10−47). These were also
significantly associated with higher grade me-
ningiomas [P = 5.90 × 10−5; odds ratio (OR) =
3.54]. Higher-grade tumors also showed an in-
creased number of large-scale chromosomal ab-
normalities (Fig. 2D and fig. S6) (6.9 versus
1.7 events per tumor) and an increased rate of
NF2 mutations (P = 0.03; OR = 1.96) and were
observed more frequently in males than females
(P = 6.45 × 10−4; OR = 2.93).

Given these observations pointing to distinct
tumor subtypes based on mutation profiles, we

some 22 loss, which is typically as-

mutations), genomic stability is a

(inner circles, n = 36). (E) Along the

examined whether the mutation spectrum cor-
related with anatomical distribution and histo-
logical subtype. We initially grouped cerebral
meningiomas into those originating along the
skull base or those present in the cerebral hemi-
spheres (Fig. 2E, fig. S7, and table S4). Inter-
estingly, tumors with NF2 mutations and/or
chromosome 22 loss (NF2/chr22loss) were pre-
dominantly found in the hemispheres (P = 9.22 ×
10−14; OR = 6.74) with nearly all posterior ce-
rebral (parieto-occipital), cerebellar, or spinal me-
ningiomas being NF2/chr22loss tumors (fig. S8).
For the meningiomas originating from the skull
base, we observed a difference between those
originating from medial versus lateral regions.
The vast majority of non-NF2 meningiomas
were medial (P = 4.36 × 10−8; medial versus
lateral OR = 8.80), whereas the lateral and pos-
terior skull base meningiomas had NF2/chr22loss
−12; OR = 23.11). Meningiomas
(P = 1.55 × 10
with only the recurrent SMO L412F mutation
(n = 5) all localized to the medial anterior skull
base, near the midline. This is particularly inter-
esting because mutations in Hedgehog signaling
result in holoprosencephaly, the midline failure
of embryonic forebrain to divide into two hemi-
spheres (12).

Mutational profiles also were correlated with
histological diagnoses. For example, all of the
meningiomas with a “secretory” component
(n = 12), which follow a more aggressive clin-
ical course owing to increased brain swelling,

carried both TRAF7 and KLF4 mutations (Pco =
6.02 × 10−12) (fig. S9).

Consistent with these clinical observations, un-
supervised hierarchical clustering of meningiomas
based on gene expression and chromatin immu-
noprecipitation for H3K27 acetylation followed
by sequencing (H3K27ac ChIP-seq) analyses con-
firmed clustering into NF2/chr22loss versus non-
NF2 mutant subgroups (Fig. 2F and figs. S10 and
S11) and revealed several molecules whose acety-
lation and expression was specific to a subtype (ta-
bles S5 and S6). For these differentially expressed
genes, there was a strong correlation between ex-
pression and ChIP-seq data (fig. S12). Among the
non-NF2 meningiomas, SMO mutants were clearly
defined by increased expression and activation of the
Hedgehog pathway (fig. S13 and tables S7 and S8).
These results clearly identify meningioma sub-
groups, distinguishing them based on their mu-
tually exclusive distribution of mutations, distinct
potential for chromosomal instability and malig-
nancy, anatomical location, histological appear-
ance, gene expression, and H3K27ac profile. Our
results show that the mutational profile of a
meningioma can largely be predicted based on its
anatomical position, which in turn may predict
likely drug response (e.g., Hedgehog inhibitors for
midline tumors). This may prove relevant for sur-
gically unresectable, recurrent, or invasive meningi-
omas and could spare patients surgery or irradiation,
an independent risk factor for progression of
these generally benign tumors.

HSP-100 protein machines, such as ClpB, play an essential role in reactivating protein
aggregates that can otherwise be lethal to cells. Although the players involved are known,
including the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system in bacteria, details of the molecular
interactions are not well understood. Using methyl–transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we present an atomic-resolution model for the ClpB-DnaK
complex, which we verified by mutagenesis and functional assays. ClpB and GrpE compete
for binding to the DnaK nucleotide binding domain, with GrpE binding inhibiting
disaggregation. DnaK, in turn, plays a dual role in both disaggregation and subsequent
refolding of polypeptide chains as they emerge from the aggregate. On the basis of a
combined structural-biochemical analysis, we propose a model for the mechanism of
protein aggregate reactivation by ClpB.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectros-
copy is especially suited to characterize protein
complexes at atomic detail, even if the inter-
actions are weak and transient. Methyl–transverse
relaxation–optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)–based
experiments (9) and labeling schemes, whereby
Ile, Leu, and Val methyl groups are 13CH3-labeled
in an otherwise highly deuterated background (re-
ferred to as ILV-protein) (10), have enabled NMR
studies of large molecular systems (11, 12), such
as those involved in disaggregation. Using these
methods, we set out to elucidate the DnaK bind-
ing site on the ClpB chaperone.

Because of the large size of each monomer of
ClpB (97 kD), NMR spectra of the ILV-labeled
protein overlapped, precluding detailed analyses
of the full-length molecule (fig. S1). We separately
analyzed two monomeric fragments, including (i)
ClpBDNBD2, comprising the N-terminal domain
(NTD), nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), and
the coil-coil domain (CCD), and (ii) nucleotide

The 580-kD hexameric ClpB molecular chap-

erone is a bacterial adenosine 5´-triphosphate
(ATP)–dependent protein-remodeling ma-
chine that rescues stress-damaged proteins trapped
in an aggregated state and plays a key role in ther-
motolerance development and in cell recovery after
acute stress (1–3). Aggregate reactivation requires
the collaboration of a second ATP-dependent mo-

lecular chaperone system, Hsp70/DnaK (1, 4–7).
DnaK binding to client proteins is, in turn, reg-
ulated by co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE through
modulation of the DnaK ATPase cycle (8). A
molecular picture of the ClpB-DnaK complex is
critical to elucidate the mechanism of protein dis-
aggregation, yet this system has proven recalcitrant
to detailed structural studies.
