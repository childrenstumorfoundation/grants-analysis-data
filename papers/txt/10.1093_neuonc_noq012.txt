Vestibular schwannomas (VS) arising sporadically or in
patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) consist-
ently lack expression of Merlin, a tumor suppressor.
Conventional treatment options include surgery and
radiotherapy but there is no validated medical option.
Recent evidence suggests that Merlin deﬁciency may
result
in abnormal activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) and downstream signaling, promoting
tumor growth. Although small-molecule RTK inhibitors
are widely available for clinical use, no such therapy has
been validated in patients with VS. To screen for RTK
activation, surgical VS specimens from patients with
and without NF2 were analyzed by phospho-RTK pro-
ﬁling arrays. Downstream signaling pathway activation
was analyzed by phospho-MAPK arrays. Activated
RTKs and downstream kinases were validated immuno-
histochemically in corresponding formalin-ﬁxed, paraf-
ﬁn-embedded
and
immunohistochemistry showed consistent overexpres-
sion and activation of EGFR family receptors and

evidence of ERK1/2 downstream signaling was
observed in all samples analyzed (n 5 11). Based on
the ﬁndings, the small-molecule EGFR/ErbB2 kinase
inhibitor lapatinib was selected for evaluation of target
inhibition and treatment efﬁcacy in our in vitro human
schwannoma model. EGFR/ErbB2 targeted therapy
with lapatinib inhibited ErbB2 phosphorylation and sur-
vivin upregulation, as well as downstream ERK1/2 and
AKT activation, resulting in decreased proliferation. We
conclude that EGFR family receptor activation is a con-
sistent feature of both sporadic and NF2-related VS.
Molecular targeted therapy with lapatinib downregu-
lates survivin and has antiproliferative activity in a pre-
clinical VS model. Based on these ﬁndings, a clinical
trial with lapatinib for the treatment of VS is currently
underway.

Vestibular schwannomas (VS) usually arise from

Schwann cells surrounding the vestibular branch
of the cochlear nerve. Sporadic unilateral VS is
the most frequent presentation, usually with hearing
impairment, tinnitus, and vertigo in the 5th or 6th
decade of life, but patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type
2 (NF2) typically present with bilateral VS at an earlier
age. The treatment of sporadic VS is mainly surgical or
radiosurgical, and increased hearing loss and facial
nerve impairment are signiﬁcant risks of treatment. The
morbidity of these therapies in patients with NF2 is fre-
quently greater, as related to the larger size of tumors at
presentation. In addition, VS frequently recur in NF2
patients following an incomplete resection. For NF2

sive medical options that are effective not only for VS, but
also for other schwannomas and the frequently associ-
ated meningiomas and spinal cord ependymomas.1

the

cell membrane.4 – 6 Studies

Both sporadic and NF2-related VS are deﬁcient in
Merlin, a tumor suppressor. Merlin is closely related to
the ezrin/radixin/moesin family of cytoskeletal linker
proteins, which link membrane-associated proteins to
the actin cytoskeleton.2,3 Although the mechanisms
through which Merlin controls cell proliferation remain
poorly understood, recent studies suggest that abnormal
activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) may play
a key role in cell proliferation. Activated Merlin localizes
to and stabilizes cadherin-dependent cell-to-cell junc-
tions, which may result in a negative regulatory effect
on RTKs at
in
Drosophila show that Merlin also facilitates endocytic
trafﬁcking of membrane receptors, including RTKs.7 In
addition, Merlin may also directly oppose the activation
of Rac, which is recruited through joint integrin-RTK sig-
naling.8,9 These mechanisms may, at least in part, explain
the observations that loss of Merlin activates pro-survival
and proliferation pathways such as ERK1/2, AKT, and
JNK.8,10 – 12 Merlin-deﬁcient cells overexpress PDGFRb
with downstream activation of ERK1/2 and AKT, result-
ing in abnormal growth signals.10,13 Aberrant EGFR acti-
vation due to anomalous receptor compartmentalization
has been linked to Merlin deﬁciency as well, and pharma-
cological
inhibition of EGFR signaling successfully
blocked cellular proliferation in Merlin-negative cells.14
These ﬁndings suggest that merlin affects multiple
signaling pathways. The data, however, originates from
multiple cell types and in vitro systems, and the pathways
most relevant for VS growth in vivo are not known.

In line with in vitro observations, expression of
several ErbB family receptors,
including EGFR, has
been reported in surgical schwannoma samples.15 In
another study, an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody
reduced schwannoma cell proliferation in vitro.16
More recently, an EGFR inhibitor and an ErbB2 anti-
body were shown to reduce the growth of VS in a xeno-
graft model.17 Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest
that abnormal
and
PDGFRb may represent attractive therapeutic targets
in VS. Although a plethora of novel agents targeting
RTK signaling pathways are under clinical
investi-
gation,18 no such drugs have been validated for the treat-
ment of VS. A recent case report
that
EGFR-directed therapy with erlotinib may have activity
in patients with NF2-related VS.19

signaling via EGFR, ErB2,

suggests

To date, no comprehensive proﬁling of RTK
expression and activation has been performed in VS.
To screen for potential therapeutic targets, surgical VS
specimens from patients with and without NF2 were
analyzed by phospho-RTK proﬁling arrays. Activation
of downstream signaling pathways was analyzed by
phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK)
proﬁling arrays. Subsequently, activated RTKs and
downstream kinases were validated immunohisto-
chemically in corresponding formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-
embedded tissues (FFPE).

Ammoun et al.: ErbB/HER and lapatinib in vestibular schwannoma

Based on our ﬁnding of consistent activation of ErbB
family receptors and downstream ERK1/2 signaling, we
decided to evaluate the efﬁcacy and mechanisms of
action of lapatinib, a small molecule that inhibits both
EGFR and ErB2, in our in vitro Schwannoma model.
Lapatinib effectively inhibited b-heregulin-mediated
phosphorylation/activation of ErbB2 receptor, ERK1/
2, AKT, and S6 ribosomal protein, as well as cell pro-
liferation. Treatment with lapatinib over 72 hours
resulted in decreased expression of the antiapoptotic
protein survivin, which is known to be regulated by
ErbB2 signaling.20,21

Materials and Methods

Chemical Compounds and Antibodies

Lapatinib was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, dissolved
in DMSO at stock concentration of 10 mM, and stored
at 2208C. All antibodies and chemicals were purchased
from Cell Signaling and Sigma, respectively, unless
stated otherwise.

Patient Samples

Following informed consent, fresh surgical tissue speci-
mens were collected from VS patients, and a portion of
the tumor not needed for diagnosis was snap frozen
immediately and stored in a tumor bank at 2708C.
Tumor tissue from 11 VS patients was available for
this study (7 NF2 and 4 nonNF2 patients). Frozen speci-
mens were available from 10 patients and FFPE tissue
available from 8 patients. Two fresh-frozen specimens of
normal facial nerves, including 1 from an NF2 patient,
served as controls. All samples were collected and used
under protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board at New York University School of Medicine.

Antibody Arrays

To screen RTK phosphorylation status of VS tumors in
vivo, we analyzed surgical VS specimens from 7 NF2
and 3 nonNF2 patients using a phospho-RTK proﬁling
array, detecting relative phosphorylation levels of 42
RTKs (AXL, DTK, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4,
EphA1, EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, EphA6, EphA7,
EphB1, EphB2, EphB4, EphB6, FGFR1, FGFR2a,

C-RET, ROR1, ROR2, Tie-1, Tie-2, TrkA, TrkB,
TrkC, MuSK, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3). To
determine the activation status of downstream signaling
pathways, we subsequently analyzed the specimens for
relative phosphorylation of 18 MAPK and serine/threo-
nine kinases, using a phospho-kinase proﬁling array
(AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, AKT pan, ERK1, ERK2,

sporadic and NF2-related VS tumors and normal vestib-
ular nerve (controls) were thawed in lysis buffer, hom-
ogenized by hand 50 times with disposable pestles,
incubated for 30 minutes at 48C with inversion and
then cleared by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm,
for
10 minutes at 48C. Protein concentration was quantiﬁed
using a BCA Protein assay (Pierce) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Phospho-RTK and phospho-MAPK array
analysis (ARY-001 and ARY-002 Proteome Proﬁler,
R&D Systems) was performed as per manufacturer’s
instructions using 500 mg protein lysate per array.

Immunohistochemistry

To validate the phospho-array ﬁndings and localize the
observed signals histologically, we performed immuno-
histochemistry on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
samples from all VS samples with parafﬁn-embedded
tissue available (n ¼ 8). We also stained for survivin,
an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family protein, which is
expressed in a variety of tumors and regulated via acti-
vation of EGFR/ErbB2 and PI3K/AKT.20 – 22 Brieﬂy,
5-mm sections were deparafﬁnized, followed by micro-
wave antigen retrieval. Primary monoclonal antibodies
used were: EGFR, ErbB2, phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/
Tyr204, clone 20G11), and survivin (clone 12C4,
DAKO).

The DAKO EnVision kit was used for detection and
staining as per manufacturer’s instructions. Staining
was scored as described previously,23 with (i) weak
focal staining, (ii) weak diffuse staining, (iii) strong
focal staining, and (iv) strong diffuse staining.

Human Schwann and Schwannoma Cell Isolation
and Culture

Human primary Schwann and schwannoma cells were
isolated and cultured as previously described.24 For
immunoblotting experiments, cells from 5 NF2-related
and 1 sporadic schwannomas were used. For prolifer-
ation assays, cells from 7 NF2-related and 5 sporadic
schwannomas were used.

Immunoblotting

Cells were grown in pre-coated 35 mm plates (Greiner
Bio-One), serum starved for 24 hours, stimulated with
100 ng/ml of b-heregulin for 5 minutes, and lysed.25
Lapatinib (10 mM) was added 40 minutes prior to
stimulation. Western blotting was performed as
previously described,6,8 using anti-active-MAPK (anti-
pThr183-pTyr185-ERK1/2)
(1:2000; Promega), anti-
phospho-AKT (Ser473)
(1:500), anti-phospho-ErbB2
(Tyr1221/1222)
(1:500),
anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein (Ser235/236) (1:500), and anti-survivin (1:500)

bodies was performed using goat-anti-rabbit HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies
(Biorad). Western
blot bands were detected by ECL-plus (Amersham).

Nuclear Staining for Cell Growth

Cells were cultivated on pre-coated 96-well plates
(Nunc) for 24 or 72 hours and ﬁxed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 mg/ml)
for 10 minutes and total cell numbers were manually
counted. Cell viability determination was performed
using propidium iodide (PI) (2.5 mg/ml). Lapatinib (3,
5, and 10 mM) was added 40 minutes before cell
stimulation.

Data Analysis

Student’s 2-tailed t-tests were applied. Every experiment
was repeated 3 times at minimum and at least 3 indepen-
dent batches of cells from different individuals were
tested. In cell proliferation and viability assays, all cells
in each well were counted (ns means not signiﬁcant,
P . 0.05; *P , 0.05; **P , 0.01; ***P , 0.001). In
ﬁgures, mean + SEM is given.

Results

Phospho-RTK Proﬁling Arrays

Fresh-frozen specimens from 7 NF2 patients and 3
nonNF2 patients were available for analysis. An
example of a phospho-RTK array from a VS sample is
shown (Fig. 1A) and results from all samples are sum-
marized (Table 1). Relative phosphorylation signal of
each kinase was recorded as strong, weak, or undetect-
able. All VS specimens showed phosphorylation of
several RTKs, with EGFR family receptors being most
strongly and consistently activated; all VS specimens
showed activation of EGFR and at least 1 additional
(ie, ErbB2, ErbB3, and/or
EGFR family receptor
ErbB4). Additional RTKs detected and phosphorylated
in ,50% of the samples were PDGFRb, AXL, SKY,
MER, and RON. No signals were detectable in the
control specimens (Fig. 1B and Table 1).

Phospho-MAPK Proﬁling Arrays

Analysis of a VS specimen by phospho-MAPK array is
shown (Fig. 2A). Relative phosphorylation signal of
each kinase was recorded as strong, weak, or undetect-
able (Table 2). Strong phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was
detected in all samples anayzed. Weak phosphorylation
of several p38 kinase subunits was present in most
samples, as well as GSK3a/b, HSP27, JNK2, and
RSK1 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) in some. Of note, no
phosphorylation of AKT or p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K, a
biological readout of mTOR pathway activation) was
visible. In the control specimens, no signals were detect-
able (Fig. 2B and Table 2).

Immunohistochemistry

In keeping with the phospho-array results, immunohis-
tochemistry conﬁrmed expression of EGFR and ErbB2,
as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in tumor cells
of all samples tested (Fig. 3A, B, and C, respectively).
In addition, expression of survivin was detected in the
tumor cells of all patients tested (Fig. 3D). Immunohisto-
chemistry results are summarized in Table 3. Adjacent
connective and normal nerve tissues did not stain posi-
tive for any of the antigens probed. Additional negative
controls without primary antibodies showed no staining
(not shown). Positive controls included lung and breast
cancer specimens with known antigen expression.

Taken together, the results indicated that overexpres-
sion and phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2, as well as

downstream activation of ERK1/2 are consistently
observed in both sporadic and NF2-related VS in vivo.
In addition, survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein that
may be regulated via EGFR/ErbB2 signaling, is overex-
pressed by VS. Therefore, we tested the “drugability” of
the identiﬁed molecular targets with lapatinib, a com-
bined EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, using a human schwan-
noma in vitro model.

10 mM completely inhibited b-heregulin mediated but
(nonstimulated) ErbB2 receptor, ERK1/2,
not basal
AKT, and S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A–D). Additionally, long-term (72 hours) treatment
of schwannoma cells with lapatinib (5 mM) led to downre-
gulation of survivin, a human IAP protein (Fig. 4E).

(0.5 mM) for 24 hours resulted in increased total cell
number (determined by DAPI staining of the nuclei) by
up to 20%, which was completely reverted by lapati-
nib (3 mM) (Fig. 5A). Cell viability was not affected at
these conditions as estimated by PI staining (Fig. 5B).
Lapatinib at 5 and 10 mM signiﬁcantly decreased
schwannoma cell viability in a concentration-dependent
manner starting at 24 hours (Fig. 5C).

speciﬁc and effective therapies, especially when they
occur in multiple locations such as in NF2. To screen
for suitable therapeutic targets, we determined the
expression and activation of different RTKs and their
downstream signaling pathways that are potentially
involved in the development and progression of human
schwannoma using phospho-protein proﬁling arrays.
Positive targets were further veriﬁed by immunohisto-
chemistry. Based on these data and rational target selec-
tion, we employed our primary human in vitro

inhibition and antitumor efﬁcacy of the EGFR/ErbB2
small-molecule inhibitor lapatinib.

We show overexpression and activation of a variety
of RTKs previously shown to be overexpressed and acti-
vated in VS,
including PDGFR and EGFR family
RTKs,10,13,16,27 as well as additional tyrosine kinase
receptors not previously associated with VS, such as
AXL, SKY, MER, and RON. The AXL subfamiliy of
RTKs is expressed in a variety of normal tissues and
includes AXL (ubiquitously expressed in many organs),
SKY (widely expressed in the brain), and MER (mono-
cytes, epithelial cells). However, AXL subfamily RTKs
also possess transforming activity and are overexpressed
in some cancers.28 Additionally, MER displays antia-
poptotic effects and its signaling is directly connected
to integrins, src, and FAK.28 Similarly, SKY also
signals via src. SKY also interacts with the p85 subunit
of PI3K and modulates ERK activity. RON may be
found in normal epithelial cells, as well as macrophages,
bone marrow stem cells, and osteoclasts,29 but is overex-
pressed in malignant tumors30 and may promote cell
migration, invasion,31 and proliferation.32 Since AXL,
SKY, MER, and RON are implicated in tumorigenesis
and signal via pathways known to be upregulated in
human schwannomas (ie, FAK, PI3K, and ERK),13,33
the potential role of this group of RTKs in schwannoma
development should be investigated in future studies.

In our study, the strongest and most consistent phos-
phorylation was found for the EGFR family receptors
EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, as well as down-
stream protein kinases such as ERK1/2, p-38 MAPK

(A) Lapatinib (10 mM) is a very potent inhibitor of ErbB2 receptor activity. (B, C, and D) Lapatinib (10 mM) completely inhibits b-heregulin
(100 ng/ml) mediated ERK1/2, AKT, and S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation/activation. The cells were starved for 24 hours before
stimulation, pre-treated with lapatinib (10 mM) for 40 minutes, and stimulated with b-heregulin (100 ng/ml) for 5 minutes. The
phosphorylated/activated levels of ErbB2 p-Tyr1221/1222, ERK1/2 p-Thr183/p-Tyr185, AKT p-Ser473, and S6 ribosomal protein p-Ser235/236
were detected by immunoblotting. (E) Lapatinib downregulates the expression of survivin in human primary schwannoma cells. The cells
were serum starved for 24 hours and incubated with lapatinib for 72 hours. Day 1: the cells were pre-incubated for 40 minutes with
0.5 mM lapatinib, Day 2: 0.25 mM lapatinib was added, Day 3: 5 mM of lapatinib was added. The cells were lysed on day 4, and total
levels of survivin were detected by immunoblotting using anti-survivin antibody. The data are corrected to a loading control RhoGDI and
given as a % of basal (nonstimulated cells).

Fig. 5. Lapatinib effects on the proliferation and viability of human primary schwannoma cells (NF22/2), as well as survivin expression.
(A) Lapatinib (3 mM) completely inhibits b-heregulin (100 ng/ml) and forskolin (0.5 mM) mediated schwannoma proliferation. (B)
Lapatinib at 3 mM has no signiﬁcant effect on schwannoma cell viability. (C) Lapatinib at 5 and 10 mM signiﬁcantly decreases
schwannoma cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner after 24 hours treatment. In all experiments, the cells were cultured for
24 hours with or without b-heregulin (100 ng/ml) þ forskolin (0.5 mM) and lapatinib. Total cell amount was estimated by nuclear
staining with DAPI (1 mg/ml) and cell counting. The viability of the cells was estimated with PI (2.5 mg/ml) staining and cell counting.
The data are corrected to a loading control RhoGDI and given as the % of basal (nonstimulated). In (A), the data are normalized to the
basal levels (nonstimulated cells) and given as a % of basal (nonstimulated). In (B) and (C), the data are given as a % of total cell number.

(a, b, and d), and GSK3a/b in both NF2-related and
sporadic VS using phospho-protein arrays. The lack of
detectable phospho-AKT is consistent with recent bio-
logical studies suggesting that mTORC1 is constitutively
activated in Merlin-deﬁcient tumors and involved in a
negative feedback loop that diminishes PI3K-AKT sig-
naling in response to growth factor stimulation.34,35
However, we did not detect activation of p70 S6K by
phospho-arrays, which is downstream of mTORC1
and together with phospho-S6 considered a sensitive
biological readout of mTORC1 activation. On the
other hand, phosphorylation of S6 has been demon-
strated in VS specimens recently,34 and lack of detect-
able phospho-p70 S6K in our array-based assay may
be due to technical limitations. In keeping with the pre-
dominant phosphorylation of EGFR family receptors
identiﬁed by the phospho-arrays, strong overexpression
of EGFR and ErbB2 was conﬁrmed by immunohisto-
chemistry in our VS specimens. Our current data regard-
ing the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR,
ErbB2, and ErbB3 in VS conﬁrm and expand on pre-
vious ﬁndings.13,15,16,36 The observed lack of EGFR
expression and response to its ligand EGF in our
primary human in vitro schwannoma model13 is

possibly due to culture conditions. ErbB2/ErbB3 signal-
ing, however, has long been established to be of key
importance for Schwann cell differentiation and pro-
liferation,37 and neuregulin 1 (heregulin), an ErbB2/3
receptor agonist, has been shown to be expressed in
VS.16,38 We therefore chose to concentrate on the func-
tional relevance of ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor signaling and
kinase inhibition in vitro.

In accordance with data on the crucial role of ErbB2/
ErbB3 signaling in Schwann cells and supporting the rel-
evance of ErbB2/ErbB3 overexpression in schwanno-
mas, we found strong phosphorylation/activation of
ErbB2 upon stimulation with b-heregulin, leading to
the activation of both mitogenic (ERK1/2 and S6 ribo-
somal protein) and pro-survival (AKT and survivin)
pathways in human primary schwannoma cells. As
shown in NF2-deﬁcient mouse Schwann cells, Merlin
loss may result in accumulation of ErbB2 and ErbB3
receptors on the cell membrane, leading to the activation
of downstream signaling pathways such as ERK and
AKT and increased cell proliferation.27 Thus, ErbB2
and its downstream signaling pathways may be relevant
in human schwannoma development, rendering ErbB2
an important therapeutic target.

Since both EGFR and ErbB2 represent molecular
targets in VS, we chose lapatinib for preclinical evalu-
ation. Lapatinib is a small molecule RTK inhibitor that
is orally active and reversibly inhibits EGFR as well as
ErbB2,39 blocking phosphorylation and activation of
ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) and AKT (phospho-AKT)
in EGFR and/or ErbB2-expressing tumor cell lines and
animal xenografts.40 – 42 Depending on tumor cell type,
lapatinib has
antitumor
effects.42 Correlation between tumor response and pre-
treatment
and
(phospho)-ERK1/2 has been demonstrated in solid
tumors.43 Lapatinib has advantages over other small-
molecule EGFR inihibitors (ie, erlotinib), as it targets
both EGFR and ErbB2. We demonstrate that lapatinib
effectively inhibits heregulin-mediated phosphorylation
of ErbB2, ERK, AKT, and S6 ribosomal protein.
Heregulin-mediated proliferation of human primary
schwannoma cells is also completely reversed to the
basal level by 3 mM lapatinib without affecting cell viabi-
lity. Higher concentrations of lapatinib (5 and 10 mM),
however, signiﬁcantly decrease schwannoma cell viabi-
lity in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent
lines.42
with previous ﬁndings in nonmalignant cell
Furthermore, prolonged (72 hours)
incubation of
schwannoma cells with 5 mM lapatinib strongly
decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein
survivin, which has been shown to be regulated by
EGFR/ErbB2 and PI3K/AKT signaling.20 – 22 In parallel,
we found consistent overexpression of survivin in VS
in vivo, which is in line with prior observations in
schwannomas44,45 and suggests that survivin should be
explored as a therapeutic target in VS. Survivin-directed
immunotherapy approaches, as well as survivin antagon-
ists, have been developed for clinical use in cancer46 and
are being investigated in early-stage clinical trials.

Complementary to our ﬁndings, several supporting
lines of evidence suggest lapatinib as an attractive candi-
date for clinical evaluation in the treatment of VS. Based
on preclinical studies47 as well as clinical responses in
patients with brain metastases,48 lapatinib may cross
the blood –brain barrier and achieve therapeutic drug
concentrations in the CNS. Correlation between tumor
response and pre-treatment levels of phospho-ErbB2
and phospho-ERK1/2 has been demonstrated in solid
tumors.43 Lapatinib is FDA approved for the treatment
of metastatic breast cancer and has been shown to be
well tolerated with predictable and manageable side
effects.49 In addition, pediatric safety and dosing data
are available from an ongoing pediatric phase I/II trial
by the Children’s Oncology Group for refractory CNS
malignancies (NCT00095940). This is an important
consideration since some of the most severely affected
VS patients are children with NF2.

In summary, based on our data and additional sup-
porting evidence, we have identiﬁed lapatinib as a prom-
ising candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of
VS. Accordingly, we have initiated a multi-center phase
0 clinical trial for VS patients (NCT00863122) to deter-
mine the achievable intratumoral concentration of lapa-
tinib and to assess target inhibition as well as biological
activity in vivo.
