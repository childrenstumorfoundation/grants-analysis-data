Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from germline mutations in
the NF2 gene. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas, tumors on cranial nerve VIII, are pathognomonic for NF2 dis-
ease. Furthermore, schwannomas also commonly develop in other cranial nerves, dorsal root ganglia and per-
ipheral nerves. These tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and medical therapies to treat them
are limited. Animal models that accurately recapitulate the full anatomical spectrum of human NF2-related
schwannomas, including the characteristic functional deﬁcits in hearing and balance associated with cranial
nerve VIII tumors, would allow systematic evaluation of experimental therapeutics prior to clinical use. Here,
we present a genetically engineered NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2 gene driven by
Cre expression under control of a tissue-restricted 3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. By 10 months of age,
100% of Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice develop spinal, peripheral and cranial nerve tumors histologically identical
to human schwannomas. In addition, the development of cranial nerve VIII tumors correlates with functional
impairments in hearing and balance, as measured by auditory brainstem response and vestibular testing.
Overall, the Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox tumor model provides a novel tool for future mechanistic and therapeutic stud-
ies of NF2-associated schwannomas.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant dis-
order that arises from germline heterozygosity of the NF2
tumor suppressor gene, and affected individuals have a high pro-
pensity for the acquisition of multiple schwannomas. Vestibular
schwannomas that develop on cranial nerve VIII (CN VIII) are

pathognomonic for NF2, arise with nearly complete penetrance
and cause progressive hearing loss and balance abnormalities
(1). In addition, vestibular schwannomas can also contribute to
early mortality owing to brainstem compression and surgical
complications (1).

Although vestibular schwannomas are pathognomonic for
NF2, schwannomas can occur on any cranial, spinal or distal

peripheral nerve. In addition, sporadic schwannomas observed
in patients without familial NF2 disease are almost universally
NF2 deﬁcient, underscoring the critical function of the NF2
tumor suppressor gene in Schwann cells (1). Sporadic schwan-
nomas are often treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy, but
the latter option is controversial for NF2 patients already harbor-
ing a germline mutation in a tumor suppressor gene (2). Thus,
there exists a large unmet clinical need for medical alternatives
to treatment of schwannomas, especially in NF2 patients.

A useful preclinical animal model of human disease requires
broad physiological relevance at both genotypic and phenotypic
levels (3). Therefore, genetically engineered murine (GEM)
models of human disease should harbor mutations in gene(s)
homologous to gene(s) mutated in human cancer. Moreover,
this genetic perturbation should occur in cell types and gene
doses similar to the hypothetical human tumor cell of origin.
These tissue-speciﬁc genetic mutations should induce tumors
that share histological and biological characteristics with the
corresponding human tumors. Additionally, the GEM tumors
should be expected to develop in a similar anatomical distri-
bution and with similar functional consequence as human
tumors. Importantly, the ﬁrst-generation murine NF2 model
demonstrated that Nf2 disruption in Schwann cell lineages
during embryogenesis promotes schwannoma formation (4,5).
In existing models, however, schwannomas are incompletely
penetrant (only occurring in about one-third of mice) and, gener-
ally, arise only late in life. Furthermore, vestibular schwannomas
have not been observed in existing murine models of NF2. These
temporal, anatomical and functional divergences from the
human phenotype are critical barriers to in vivo genetic and
pharmacologic studies that could facilitate better understanding
of the molecular pathogenesis of NF2-associated schwannomas.
Additionally, lack of an optimal mouse model NF2-associated
schwannomas prevents
the development and preclinical
testing of novel therapeutics for these tumors.

The prior published murine Nf2 conditional knockout model
depends on Cre-mediated Nf2 allele excision driven by the P0
promoter element, which is expressed in neural crest cells at
embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) and in Schwann cell progenitors at
E12.5 (5). We hypothesized that an alternate promoter element
with distinct developmental timing and anatomical distribution
may provide an additional opportunity to recapitulate the pheno-
typic consequences of human NF2 mutations and disease mani-
festations in mice. Therefore, we investigated Cre expression
driven by the 3.9-kb upstream promoter region of the Periostin
gene (Postn-Cre), which prior studies have shown to drive
robust reporter gene expression in Schwann cell progenitors
beginning at E10 (6). We intercrossed mice carrying loxp
sequences ﬂanking exon 2 of the Nf2 gene (Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox) (5) with
Postn-Cre mice, generating Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice and
their Cre-negative control littermates. Here, we present this
intercross, which results in the consistent development of
schwannomas that closely recapitulate features of the human
disease, including hearing loss and vestibular impairment asso-
ciated with vestibular schwannoma development.

RESULTS
Initial studies demonstrated that all Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice
sacriﬁced at 15 months of age possessed signiﬁcant enlargements

of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and proximal spinal nerve roots
(Fig. 1A and B). Subsequent histological analyses indicated
that these enlargements are present at every vertebral level in
Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice. To better understand the time course
of these enlargements, we sacriﬁced and dissected mice at multiple
time points. By 5 months of age, all Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice
acquired enlargements of their DRG and proximal spinal nerve
roots, with microscopic evidence of Schwann cell hyperplasia
and/or schwannoma, featuring dense, intersecting fascicles of
Schwann cells (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). By 8 months,
all Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice demonstrated DRG and proximal
spinal nerve tumors with histological characteristics of frank
schwannoma (Fig. 1C and D). Further analyses demonstrated
diffuse S100-positivity of tumors from Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox
mice, consistent with the established diagnostic criteria for genet-
ically engineered mouse (GEM) Grade I schwannoma (Fig. 1E)
(9). The histological pattern of growth observed in these tumors
largely resembled the Antoni A pathologic subtype observed in
human tumors, which has been noted in previous studies of
murine schwannomas (9). At 15 months, dissected spinal cords
from Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice demonstrated more than a ﬁve-
fold increase in DRG volume as compared with Cre-negative
control littermates (Fig. 1F). Thus, Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice
develop slow-growing, low-grade schwannomas highly reminis-
cent of schwannomas observed in individuals with NF2.

Detailed temporal analysis of cohorts

revealed that
Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice had a reduced lifespan as compared
with Cre-negative Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox control mice (Fig. 1G). In the
majority of mice, only multiple large schwannomas were
observed. However, 5 of 16 Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice analyzed
required sacriﬁce owing to the development of tumors that, upon
histological examination, were found to be GEM Grade III
lesions consistent with malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).
MPNSTs, malignant sarcomas and malignant carcinomas have
also been observed with disruption of Nf2 in other genetically
engineered models (5).

Detailed examination of

schwannomas excised from
Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice indicated that these tumors possessed
an architecture highly reminiscent of schwannomas found in
human NF2 disease. Some nerves demonstrated discrete
nodules of schwannoma, similar to the Schwann cell tumorlets
commonly observed in the cauda equina of NF2 patients
(Fig. 2A) (7). In multiple cases, proliferating schwann cells
caused diffuse expansion of the nerve and extended into its
ramiﬁcations, simulating plexiform schwannomas frequently
encountered in human NF2 patients (Fig. 2B). Other focal
lesions demonstrated pseudo-onion bulb formations comprised
of proliferating Schwann cells tightly whorled around a central
feature also found in some human
axon, a histological
NF2-associated schwannomas (Fig. 2C). Finally,
in some
nerves, proliferating Schwann cells did not form a discrete
mass but rather exhibited diffuse regions of hypercellularity,
possibly representing an early neoplastic change prior to
schwannoma development (Fig. 2D).

NF2 patients develop schwannomas in multiple anatomic
regions, including peripheral, cranial and spinal nerves (10).
Interestingly, by 10 months of age, thorough dissection and
histological analysis of each Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mouse
revealed schwannomas in nearly all histological specimens of

peripheral, cranial and spinal nerves. For example, all
Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice examined for cranial nerve pathology
featured schwannomas of the trigeminal (CN V) and facial (CN
VII) nerves (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). Given the high
correlation between human NF2 disease and the presence of
bilateral vestibular schwannomas, we focused on CN VIII and
its associated functions. Histological analysis of Postn-Cre;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice revealed aberrant Schwann cell growth in CN
VIII proximal to its entry into the inner ear, including tumors
observed in Scarpa’s ganglion, the anatomic site of the afferent
nerve cell bodies prior to their synapse with vestibular hair
cells (Fig. 3A and 3B). Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice also demon-
strated Schwann cell hyperplasia in the spiral ganglion
(Fig. 3C), a structure containing nerve cell bodies that transmit
sound-derived nerve impulses from the cochlea to the brain.
One-hundred percent of Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice analyzed
for CN VIII pathology had vestibular schwannomas, whereas
no remarkable pathology was observed in CN VIII of Cre-
negative littermates. Importantly, the cochlea did not display
any other obvious structural differences between the two geno-
types (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).

To correlate these CN VIII lesions with potential functional
hearing deﬁcits, we used click-evoked auditory brainstem
response (ABR) testing, a standard method to assess hearing
loss in humans and small animals (11). ABRs are electrical
potentials recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp and
near the ear. In response to sound stimuli, a characteristic ABR
waveform with a series of peaks and troughs is observed,

where peaks correspond to different components of the ascend-
ing auditory pathway (12). We tested cohorts of mice at 3, 6, 8,
and 10 months of age, ﬁnding a progressively increasing ABR
threshold in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, whereas control mice
maintained a relatively consistent hearing threshold throughout
the study (Fig. 4A and B). Given that this click-ABR screening
was limited to a stimulus range from 30 to 90 decibel sound pres-
sure level (dB SPL) and that the majority of Cre-negative mice
exhibited robust waveforms at 30 dB SPL, it is likely that the
mean differences between the two groups are even larger than
those depicted in Figure 4B. Thus, the present data indicate a
hearing loss that is temporally correlated with tumorigenesis in
this mouse model. Functionally, a sensorineural hearing loss
of this type would negatively impact a patient’s quality of life
by limiting communication and social interaction in everyday
listening environments with background noise.

To expand our analysis of the hearing impairment

in
Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, we studied the individual peaks
present in click-ABR waveforms (Fig. 4C and E). The ﬁrst
ABR wave (W1) represents potentials generated from the coch-
lear nerve (13). The summating potential (SP), which appears as
a small shoulder preceding W1, is largely comprised of poten-
tials originating from the inner hair cells of the cochlea, with
some contributions from outer hair cells (14,15). No signiﬁcant
differences were observed between Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice
and Cre-negative control SPs at both the 6- and 8-month time
points, but a signiﬁcant reduction in SP amplitude was observed
in the Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice at 10 months (Fig. 4D). W1

amplitude was signiﬁcantly attenuated in the Postn-Cre;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice compared with Cre-negative controls at all of
the tested time points (Fig. 4F). The reduction in W1 amplitude
at the 6- and 8-month time points, when contrasted with the non-
signiﬁcant differences in SP amplitude, speciﬁcally points to a
functional disruption in the cochlear synapse and/or cochlear
nerve in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice. These data also indicate a
more extensive disruption of auditory function at the 10-month
time point, with decreased SPs suggesting diminished hair-cell
function in addition to deﬁcits in the cochlear synapse and/or
cochlear nerve. Altogether, these studies reveal that Postn-Cre;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice acquire sensorineural hearing loss that, in con-
sideration of the schwannoma histopathology described in
Figure 3, likely originates in the cochlear nerve.

Vestibular schwannomas can also severely impair a patient’s
sense of normal balance and orientation, leading to vertigo,
nausea, accidents related to falls, and, thus, substantially decreased
quality of life. In our studies with Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, we
observed that some mice acquired a phenotype suggestive of
vestibular dysfunction, as they exhibited head tilting, head
tossing, head bobbing, and locomotive circling behavior. This
behavior is collectively referred to as shaker/waltzer behavior
and has been observed in mice possessing defects in their
vestibular organs (8,16). To test for vestibular dysfunction, we
conducted three different behavioral tests to examine the integ-
rity of the vestibular system (17). Each mouse underwent a trunk
curl, contact righting and swim test on three occasions over the
course of 3 consecutive days, with the results scored by two

independent observers experimentally blinded to the genotype
of the mice. Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice demonstrated profound
impairment in their ability to successfully complete each of the
three tests when compared with their Cre-negative littermates
(Table 1).

To gain a more detailed understanding of the temporal, ana-
tomical, and cellular origins of Nf2-associated schwannomas,
we further characterized gene expression driven by the
3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. First, recombination of Nf2
was conﬁrmed in the cranial and spinal nerves (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S5). Next, we performed embryologic studies
with an intercross between Postn-Cre and Rosa26 lox-stop-lox
LacZ reporter mice. By E12.5, robust b-galactosidase expres-
sion was observed in the DRG, facial ganglia and the developing
cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S6A, B, and C). Approximately half of Schwann cells
derived from the sciatic nerve of adult mice demonstrated posi-
tive X-gal staining with universal S100-positivity (Supplemen-
tary Material, Fig. S6D and E). In the DRG, nerve roots and
peripheral nerves of E14 and E14.5 tissue, b-galactosidase
expression coincided with Brain Lipid-Binding Protein (Blbp)
expression, an established immunological marker of Schwann
cell precursors and immature Schwann cells (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S6F and G) (18). Schwann cell precursors and
immature Schwann cells are multipotential embryonic Schwann
cell lineages that descend from neural crest cells and represent
the progenitor cell populations that give rise to mature
Schwann cells. Importantly, the time points of the X-gal-stained

embryos in Supplementary Material, Figure S6 represent the
transition from Schwann cell precursors (E12 – E13) to immature
Schwann cells (E13 – E15) (18). These data indicate that
Postn-Cre is expressed in early multipotent glial cell popula-
tions, likely representing the tumor cell of origin for this model.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we describe a novel NF2 mouse model recapitulat-
ing schwannoma phenotypes
found in human patients.
NF2-associated schwannomas are most frequently located on
CN VIII and/or the spinal roots, and these tumors are seen in
nearly all NF2 patients (1). The NF2 mouse model presented
in this study develops tumors on both structures with complete
penetrance, and it also demonstrates functional impairments in
hearing and balance that are commonly associated with human
vestibular schwannomas.

The characteristics of this model permit three broad areas of
translational study. First, the genesis of genetically engineered
models and the use of genetic intercrosses to provide in vivo
proofs of concept have recently resulted in advances in the
understanding of tumor suppressor genes and their roles in regu-
lating speciﬁc signaling pathways, including other neurocuta-
neous disorders such as NF1 and tuberous sclerosis (19 – 24).
While the NF2 gene product was identiﬁed as mutated in familial
NF2 disease over 25 years ago, it remains unclear which path-
ways are critical to tumor development downstream of NF2

(25). This genetic model may provide the means for elucidating
which signaling pathways downstream of NF2 are essential to
schwannoma development.

Second, the utility of accurate preclinical models that allow
physiologic testing of clinical phenotypes is particularly import-
ant for orphan genetic diseases such as NF2, where patient
numbers limit the ability to conduct multiple meaningful trials.
In the entire USA, it is estimated that there are 12 000 individuals
that have NF2. Though nearly all patients acquire vestibular
schwannomas, at any given time, only a small number of patients
are available for clinical trials. Thus, preclinical models that can
effectively screen for pharmaceutical agents that have meaning-
ful therapeutic beneﬁt for schwannomas are essential for the ad-
vancement of NF2 therapies. Functional ABR assessment of
hearing during studies utilizing this model provides a unique,
non-invasive and physiologically relevant measure for deter-
mining therapeutic efﬁcacy of compounds.

Finally, a preclinical model can assist in understanding the
basic biology of the hearing loss associated with vestibular
schwannomas, which is incompletely understood. Tumor size
resulting in local compression of CN VIII does not appear to
account completely for the onset and progression of hearing
loss in NF2 patients (26). Interestingly, the recent short-term
improvements in hearing with Bevacizumab treatment of ves-
tibular schwannomas in NF2 patients are not consistently asso-
ciated with a reduction in tumor size (27). It has also been
suggested that biochemical disturbance of the inner-ear ﬂuids
could be the underlying cause of hearing loss related to these

Results of examination of the vestibular system in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice and
Cre-negative controls. Tests were conducted on 3 consecutive days and scored by
two independent scorers experimentally blinded to the animal’s genotype. Mice
were scored on a two-point scale, either succeeding or failing a particular test. A
detailed description of the three tests can be found in the section Materials and
methods. All mice were 13 months old at the time of testing. Fischer’s exact test
was used to test for statistically signiﬁcant differences.

contrast, Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice have signiﬁcantly reduced
SPs only at 10 months, suggesting that the structures required
for mechanoelectric transduction of sound prior to the inner-hair
cell-cochlear-nerve synapse are not signiﬁcantly impaired
earlier in the disease process. These ﬁndings, in association
with the neoplastic Schwann cell accumulation and extensive
morphologic changes seen in the spiral ganglion, strongly
suggest that a signiﬁcant component of the hearing loss in this
model originates in the cochlear nerve. Evidence for an additional,
later-onset dysfunction of cochlear origin comes from the com-
bination of increased thresholds at 10 months with further
decreased wave 1 amplitude and decreased SP. In summary,
these data suggest an early retrocochlear form of hearing loss
beginning in the cochlear nerve, and, at later time points, a
more extensive form of hearing loss incorporating both the coch-
lear nerve and cochlea. Further studies utilizing the Postn-Cre-
based NF2 mouse model may allow additional insights into
this clinical question regarding the mechanisms of hearing loss
present in vestibular schwannoma patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study approval

All studies were carried out in accordance with, and approval of,
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana
University Medical School, the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture’s Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR Parts 1, 2 and 3) and the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Figure 4. Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice show deﬁcits in both threshold and supra-
threshold ABRs.
(A) Representative ABR waveforms from individual
Cre-negative (left) and Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice (right) at 10 months of age.
(B) Time-course click-ABR study quantitating differences between Cre-
negative and Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice. Signiﬁcant threshold elevations were
seen in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice at 8 (P , 0.01) and 10 (P , 0.001) months
of age (n ¼ 15, 12, 15 and 19 mice for 3, 6, 8 and 10 months, respectively).
Thresholds were averaged across animals (mean + SEM). (C and D) The SP
(C), dominated by inner-hair-cell receptor potentials and evident in the ABR
waveform immediately preceding peak 1, is comparable in amplitude across
groups at 6 and 8 months of age but is reduced in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice at
10 months (P , 0.001) (D). (E and F) ABR wave 1 (W1) (E), representing the
summed response of the cochlear nerve, is reduced in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox
mice compared with Cre-negative controls at all ages (P , 0.05, P , 0.05,
P , 0.001) (F), indicating deﬁcits in pre- and/or post-synaptic cochlear-nerve
function. All statistical tests: two-way ANOVA with Bonferonni post hoc ana-
lysis. Thickness of waveforms (C and E) represents mean + SEM. Amplitudes
(D and F) represent high-level responses (across 60 – 90 dB SPL) averaged
across animals (mean + SEM). Horizontal dotted lines (D and F) at the base of
the y-axis indicate the noise ﬂoor measurement.

Statistical methods

tumors (28). Otoacoustic-emission studies in patients with ves-
tibular schwannomas support the hypothesis that some degree
of hearing loss is cochlear in origin (29,30). Altogether, the
degree to which hearing loss in these patients is retrocochlear
(thus likely originating in the cochlear nerve) or cochlear in
origin remains an open question.

Our studies suggest functional impairment of cochlear-nerve
activity in Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice at both early (6 and 8
months) and later (10 months) stages of disease progression. In

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0.
The Kaplan – Meier method was used to analyze the survival out-
comes of mice, and the log-rank (Mantel – Cox) test was used to
compare survival curves. As noted in the text, Analysis of Vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Bonferonni post hoc analysis or Student’s
t-test was used to test for differences in tumor volume and
hearing threshold. Speciﬁc tests and signiﬁcance levels can be
found in the figures and figure legends. Fischer’s exact test for
independence was performed on the vestibular phenotypic

data using the R Statistical Programming Environment. P-values
of ,0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Hearing screening

Auditory brainstem responses were recorded from left and right
ears of anesthetized mice (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg
xylazine by intraperitoneal injection) using subdermal needle
electrodes. Stimuli were produced, and responses were recorded
with a Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) BioSigRZ system,
using an RZ6 digital/analog converter (TDT). Responses to
clicks (512 repetitions, 30 – 90 dB SPL in 10 dB steps, presented
at 21/s with a closed-ﬁeld system) were ampliﬁed, ﬁltered
(3 Hz – 3 kHz), averaged and stored for ofﬂine analysis in
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). ABR waveforms
were additionally high-pass-ﬁltered (cut-off 200 Hz)
to
remove slow oscillations and emphasize characteristic ABR
peaks. ABR threshold was deﬁned as the lowest measured SPL
at which a reproducible peak or trough was identiﬁed. Amplitude
of the SP (Fig. 4C) was calculated as baseline-to-peak, and amp-
litude of wave 1 (W1, Fig. 4E) was calculated as peak-to-trough.

Mice and genotyping
Postn-Cre and Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox transgenic lines were maintained on
Teklad Lab Animal Diet (TD 2014, Harlan Laboratories USA)
using a 12:12 (light/dark) photoperiod at 22 – 248C. Nf2ﬂox2
and Nf2D2 bands were detected by PCR analysis as described
in Giovannini et al. (4). The Postn-Cre transgene was detected
by PCR analysis with the following primers: P1 (CAT-TTG-
GGC-CAG-CTA-AAC-AT) and P2 (CCC-GGC-AAA-ACA-
GGT-AGT-TA). Band sizes are reported in Supplementary
Material, Figure S5. Postn-Cre; Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice and Cre-negative
controls possessed the same mixed genetic background, with SNP
analysis indicating close relation to the FVB/NTac strain (87.37%
identity).

Histology and immunohistochemistry

Tumors were excised from recently sacriﬁced animals, ﬁxed
with 10% formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned and
stained with H&E. Embryos were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA), stained with X-gal, embedded in parafﬁn and then sec-
tioned. Vector labs ABC (PK-6100), DAB (SK-4100) and
Avidin/Biotin blocking (SP-2001) kits were used for immuno-
peroxidase staining. BLBP (Abcam, ab32423) primary antibody
was detected with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary anti-
body from Sigma (cat. B8896). For sectioning and staining of
inner-ear structures, mice were ﬁxed with 4% PFA injected via
intracardiac perfusion into the right atrium. Samples were then
sent to Dr Brian Faddis at the Otolaryngology Histology Core at
Washington University in St. Louis for processing and staining.

Tumor volume quantitation

After ﬁxation and decalciﬁcation in 5% formic acid, the DRG
and spinal nerves were then dissected out under a microscope.
Tumor volume was calculated using the length and width
values for a particular

in the formula volume ¼
length × width2 × 0.52, the approximate volume of a spheroid.

Vestibular studies

All of the functional vestibular studies (trunk curl, contact right-
ing and swim) were performed on 3 consecutive days, with each
test being performed once per day. The tests were scored by two
independent observers experimentally blinded to the genotype
of each animal. Fischer’s exact test was used to test for differ-
ences in the two genotypes.

For the trunk curl test, mice were individually suspended by
their tails and presented with a horizontal platform roughly
2 cm outside their reach. Control mice will reach toward this
platform, but mice with vestibular impairment will tend to curl
in toward their abdomen with their head and upper body. This
inward curling was scored as a failure for the test. Mice were
scored on a two-point system, either succeeding or failing the
test.

In the contact righting test, mice were placed in a 45-cm Plexi-
glas tube with a diameter of 6 cm, and the tube was re-oriented
until the mouse was at the approximate center of the tube,
facing toward the closed end. The tube was then rotated, and
the ability of the mice to correct their posture was assessed.
Mice that had signiﬁcant difﬁculty adjusting to the rotation fell
on their sides or on their backs. This was scored as a failure of
the test. Mice were scored on a two-point system, either succeed-
ing or failing the test.

For the swim test, a large sink (50 × 40 × 20 cm) was ﬁlled

with tepid water to a depth of 18 cm and given several hours to
equilibrate to room temperature. Mice were placed in the sink
individually, and their ability to swim was assessed for 1 min.
Normal swimming behavior was noted when the animal kept
its body aligned horizontally in the water with its nose clearly
above the surface. Abnormal swimming was noted when the
animal made vertical deviations, had substantial head tilt,
assumed an immobile ﬂoating position or had signiﬁcant lower
limb thrashing. Any abnormal swimming was scored as a
failure. Mice were scored on a two-point system, either succeed-
ing or failing the test.
