Background. Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is thought to be the key driver of pediatric low-grade astrocytoma
(PLGA) growth. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting BRAF, VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit. This multicenter phase II study was con-
ducted to determine the response rate to sorafenib in patients with recurrent or progressive PLGA.
Methods. Key eligibility criteria included age ≥2 years, progressive PLGA evaluable on MRI, and at least one prior chemotherapy treat-
ment. Sorafenib was administered twice daily at 200 mg/m2/dose (maximum of 400 mg/dose) in continuous 28-day cycles. MRI, in-
cluding 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis, was performed every 12 weeks. BRAF molecular testing was performed on tumor
tissue when available.

Results. Eleven patients, including 3 with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), were evaluable for response; 5 tested positive for BRAF dupli-
cation. Nine patients (82%) came off trial due to radiological tumor progression after 2 or 3 cycles, including 3 patients with conﬁrmed
BRAF duplication. Median time to progression was 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1–31.0 months). Enrollment was terminated early due to this
rapid and unexpectedly high progression rate. Tumor tissue obtained from 4 patients after termination of the study showed viable
pilocytic or pilomyxoid astrocytoma.

Conclusions. Sorafenib produced unexpected and unprecedented acceleration of tumor growth in children with PLGA, irrespective of
NF1 or tumor BRAF status. In vitro studies with sorafenib indicate that this effect is likely related to paradoxical ERK activation. Close
monitoring for early tumor progression should be included in trials of novel agents that modulate signal transduction.

Recurrent pediatric low-grade astrocytoma (PLGA) represents a major
clinical problem in neuro-oncology, and novel, less toxic and more ef-
fective therapies are needed.1 Recently, our increased understanding

of the key molecular pathways driving PLGA growth and the increas-
ing availability of targeted therapies for those pathways have led to
great interest in exploring molecular targeted therapies for PLGA.

Karajannis et al.: Sorafenib in pediatric low-grade astrocytomas

Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common histological
subtype of PLGA. Patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) are
predisposed to developing PAs, predominantly in the optic tract (ie,
optic pathway gliomas [OPGs]).2 NF1 is characterized by the loss of
the NF1 gene product neuroﬁbromin, resulting in activation of the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.3 The majority of sporadic PAs
harbor a unique tandem duplication at chromosome 7q34, which
produces a fusion gene between KIAA1549 and the kinase domain
of BRAF that result in constitutive BRAF and ultimately MAPK
activation. In recent genomic studies, almost all PAs that do not
harbor KIAA-BRAF have been shown to harbor other genetic lesions
that also result in constitutive MAPK pathway activation, such as
activating genetic hits in FGFR1, NTRK2, and RAF1.4,5

PLGAs express pro-angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial
growth factor [VEGF], platelet derived growth factor [PDGF]),
and their receptors (VEGFR and PDGFR).6 – 8 Bevacizumab, a
VEGF inhibitor, has recently shown very encouraging activity in
PLGA.9,10

Sorafenib is an oral, small-molecule multikinase inhibitor with
potent in vitro activity against both wild-type and mutant
(V600E) BRAF.11 Recent preclinical data showed that overexpres-
sion of activated BRAF led to increased proliferation of primary
mouse astrocytes that could be inhibited by treatment with sor-
afenib.12 Sorafenib also exerts anti-angiogenic activity via inhibi-
tion of VEGFR-1/2/3, PDGFRb, Flt-3, and c-kit, which has been
studied in a variety of preclinical models13,14 as well as in clinical
studies using dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI.15

Because sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of several key molecular
pathways that are relevant in PLGAs and encouraging preclinical
data,12 we conducted this prospective phase II clinical trial to
assess the objective response rate to sorafenib in patients with
PLGA.

Materials and Methods
Patient Eligibility and Enrollment
Adult and pediatric patients (aged ≥2 years) with recurrent or
progressive PLGA or OPG after at least one prior chemotherapy
regimen were eligible. Histological conﬁrmation of a WHO grade
I or II low-grade glioma was required, except for OPG, as were
measurable disease on MRI, a performance score of ≥60% (Kar-
nofsky or Lansky), and adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic,
and cardiopulmonary function. An interval of at least 6 months
from prior craniospinal radiotherapy (3 months for focal radio-
therapy) and 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitro-
soureas) was required. Any neurological deﬁcits had to be stable
for ≥1 week; corticosteroids were allowed for control of progres-
sive symptoms as long as the patient was on a stable or decreas-
ing dose for ≥1 week prior to enrollment. Key exclusion criteria
included baseline uncontrolled hypertension, concurrent treat-
ment with other investigational drugs or anticancer agents or
therapies, concurrent therapy with cytochrome P450 inducers
or inhibitors, or any prior central nervous system bleeding.

The trial enrolled participants at 3 centers: NYU Langone Med-
ical Center, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Johns Hopkins
Hospital. NYU Langone Medical Center served as the primary
study site, and patient eligibility, controlled patient registration
and enrollment, and tracked toxicity and response were reviewed
at that location. The study investigators at the primary site, as

well as those at the sub-sites, were primarily responsible for de-
termining disease progression according to study criteria but
were encouraged to consult with investigators at the coordinat-
ing center for equivocal cases. All MRI was centrally reviewed by
an experienced, board-certiﬁed pediatric neuro-radiologist
(S.S.M.). The study was conducted under a protocol approved by
the institutional review boards of all participating institutions, and
the protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01338857).
Informed consent was obtained from the patients and guardians
in accordance with institutional policies. All consecutive patients
who met study entry criteria and who consented to participate
were enrolled.

Study Design
This study was a multicenter, prospective, open label, 2-stage
phase II clinical trial. The primary endpoint was the objective re-
sponse rate to sorafenib in children and adults with low-grade as-
trocytomas, including OPGs. Key secondary objectives included
further characterization of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity
of sorafenib in children (aged ,18 years) treated at the currently
deﬁned, maximally tolerated dose,16 exploration of possible
associations with response rates and participants
NF1 status,
and presence or absence of constitutive BRAF activation in
the tumor. The study was originally designed to accrue partici-
pants in 4 distinct strata: non-NF1 patients with a tumor (A)
positive for constitutive BRAF activation (KIAA-BRAF fusion or
BRAF-activating mutation including BRAFV600E); (B) negative for
constitutive BRAF activation; (C) no available tumor tissue; and
(D) NF1 patients. Patients with prior surgery but without BRAF re-
sults available at the time of enrollment were allowed to enroll on
stratum C and subsequently moved to a different stratum for
analysis, depending on the subsequent availability of molecular
testing results.
To test the null hypothesis that the response rate was ≤5%
versus the alternative that the response rate was ≥25%, a
2-stage Simon design was used for each stratum.17 Nine partici-
pants were to be enrolled in the ﬁrst stage for each of the 4 strata.
If at least one of these 9 participants had at least a partial re-
sponse (PR) within 48 weeks from the beginning of therapy, an
additional 8 participants were to be enrolled in this stratum in
the second stage. If there were no responses, sorafenib was to
be considered inactive and of no interest for further evaluation,
and the trial in that stratum was to be terminated. The overall
alpha level for this design within each stratum was 0.05 with a
power of 80%. Sorafenib was to be considered effective and of in-
terest for further study in any given stratum if, after successful
completion of both stages, there were at least 3 partial responses
in the combined stages of that same stratum.

Adverse events were graded using version 4.0 of the National

Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.

Treatment
Sorafenib was supplied by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and
administered orally twice daily in continuous 4-week cycles for up
to a total of 12 cycles. For non-NF1 participants aged ≥6 and ,18
years, starting dose was 200 mg/m2/dose (rounded to the near-
est 50 mg increment) up to a maximum of 400 mg/dose.16
Non-NF1 participants aged ≥18 years received the standard

Neuro-Oncology

1409

recommended adult dose of 400 mg. For NF1 participants with
plexiform neuroﬁbromas, the dose-limiting toxicity was grade
≥3 pain.18 Therefore, the starting dose for NF1 participants
aged ≥6 and ,18 years was 80 mg/m2 (maximum 150 mg),
with planned dose escalation until the maximum dose for
non-NF1 participants was reached. Children aged ≥2 and ,6
years, irrespective of NF1 status, received a starting dose of
100 mg/m2 with dose escalation after 2 weeks to a maximum
of 150 mg/dose. For treatment-related rash, topical therapy for
symptomatic relief was prescribed as needed.19

Clinical evaluations, including complete physical and neuro-
logical exam, complete blood count with differential, comprehen-
sive metabolic panel, and serum pregnancy test (for females of
child-bearing potential) were performed weekly during cycle 1
and every 4 weeks thereafter. To monitor for potential enamel
changes or lesions, dental examinations were obtained at base-
line and every 3 cycles thereafter in participants aged ,18 years.
Because effects on the bone structure (eg, thickening of the fem-
oral growth plate) were observed in juvenile animals with sorafe-
nib, participants aged ,18 years were monitored with plain
radiographs of tibial growth plates at baseline and every third
cycle. Participants were allowed to remain on study for up to 12
cycles unless clinical or radiological progression or unacceptable
toxicity occurred. Dose interruptions and modiﬁcations due to
toxicity were allowed according to predeﬁned protocol rules.

Response Evaluation
MRIs were required at baseline within 31 days prior to starting
sorafenib and at the end of every third 4-week cycle. Target le-
sions were required to be measurable, and both enhancing and
nonenhancing tumors were measured.

Three-dimensional measurements (using standard, commer-
cially available analysis software [Vital Images Vitrea 2]) were
used to assess response; when not available, the product of the
2 largest diameters was employed. Determination of tumor re-
sponse (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable
disease [SD]) was deﬁned based on the comparison of the base-
line MRI performed at study entry or to the subsequent MRI that
demonstrated best response. Progressive disease (PD) was based
on the comparison to the study baseline MRI. PR and PD were de-
ﬁned by a .15% decrease or increase in tumor volume, respec-
tively, as measured by 3D volumetric analysis. Overall response
assessment was based on responses both in target and nontar-
get lesions as well as the appearance of any new lesions, as out-
lined in Table 1.

According to the study protocol, any participant who remained
on therapy at least until the ﬁrst on-study MRI was considered
evaluable for response.

Molecular Tumor Analysis
Molecular analysis for BRAF alterations was performed based on
tissue availability. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
was used to detect the presence or absence of KIAA1549-BRAF
tandem duplications on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded spec-
imens, as well as staining for BRAFV600E with a mutant-
speciﬁc antibody, as previously described.20,21 In addition, direct
sequencing of BRAF was performed in participants with sufﬁcient
tissue available, as previously described.22 In addition, we

performed additional targeted sequencing for KRAS and immu-
nohistochemistry for phospho-PDGFR.5

Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for measurement of sorafenib plasma concentra-
tion were collected from consenting participants ,18 years of
age after the patient had been on a stable uninterrupted dose
for at least 14 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected
immediately prior to a scheduled morning sorafenib dose, as
well as at 2 and 4 hours after (optional). Plasma samples for
Sorafenib and M2 (N-oxide) metabolite were analyzed using a
validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) assay. Sample processing involved protein precipita-
tion followed by a reversed phase high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC) separation and positive mode MS/MS
detection. The calibration range for Sorafenib was from 10 ng/
mL to 10 600 ng/mL. The calibration range for M2 was from
10 ng/mL to 2,600 ng/mL. Assay precision for both analytes dur-
ing analysis was within 15%, and accuracy was within 85% –
115%, in compliance with FDA guidance on method validation.

Sorafenib in Vitro Studies
In order to explore the efﬁcacy of sorafenib in treating cells
harboring KIAA1549-BRAF, we used NIH-3T3 cell lines stably
overexpressing BRAF fusion proteins by retroviral transduction,
as previously described.23 Cells were incubated in increasing con-
centrations of (0, 0.1, 1 mM) of BAY-54-9085 (sorafenib tosylate)
in serum-free conditions prior to lysing. Western blots were devel-
oped with chemiluminescence or with ﬂuorescent secondary
antibody. The ﬂuorescent output was measured using the Odys-
sey Imaging systems. Constructs used in this study included
“Fusion-1” (long-form of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein found in
human tumors), “Fusion-2” (short-form of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion
protein also found in human tumors), and “Fusion-3” and
“Fusion-4”, truncated forms of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein
that truncate KIAA1549 N terminus just beyond 2 putative trans-
membrane domains, and full length wild-type BRAF.

Statistical Analysis
To evaluate efﬁcacy, imaging response was treated as a binary
variable, with participants who showed at least a partial response

Response rates were estimated with exact 95% conﬁdence

Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of ﬁrst
medication dose to date of volumetric progression using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Point estimates for PFS with 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals were calculated.

Results
Patients
Twelve eligible participants with evaluable disease were enrolled
between April, 2011, and January, 2012, including 3 with NF1. All
participants except one were enrolled in 2011. Clinical character-
istics, prior treatments, and tumor BRAF status of all enrolled par-
ticipants are summarized in Table 2. The majority of participants
(8/12, 66.6%) had received ≥2 prior chemotherapy regimens
(range 2–5). There were 3 NF1 participants in stratum D (patients
2, 8, and 10), 5 participants with constitutive BRAF activation in
stratum A (patients 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9), 2 participants negative for
constitutive BRAF activation in stratum B (patients 3 and 4), and 2
non-NF1 participants with unknown BRAF status in stratum C (pa-
tients 6 and 11).

One participant (patient NE1) developed a transaminase ele-
vation after 1 week on treatment. Treatment was held as per pro-
tocol requirement. She was admitted 2 days later for urosepsis
requiring ventilator support. She was deﬁnitively taken off study
5 weeks later after a repeat brain MRI disclosed progressive
tumor growth. Response could not be assessed in this patient,
with a remaining eleven participants evaluable for the primary
outcome.

Due to an unexpectedly high rate of early radiological disease
progression, an interim Safety Committee review was performed
after an overall number of 12 participants (11 evaluable) were en-
rolled, and the decision was made to close the study for further

Responses
Baseline patient characteristics and treatment outcome in eleven
evaluable participants are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respec-
tively. The median number of cycles received by the eleven evalu-
able participants was three 4-week cycles (range 2 – 9). After
3 cycles of treatment, all but 2 participants had progressed, in-
cluding 3 patients with BRAF tandem duplication. Patient 1 decid-
ed to discontinue sorafenib after 7 cycles, with stable disease.
Patient 4, a non-NF1 9-year-old female, had a partial response
after 3 cycles, with tumor shrinkage of -43% on volumetric
measurement. Despite multiple dose interruptions and reduc-
tions, as low as 25% of her initial dose, sorafenib was discontin-
ued after 9 cycles for recurrent hand-foot skin syndrome up to
grade 3.

Surgery was performed in 3 participants (patients 2, 9, and 11)
after removal from study for progressive disease at 3, 3 and 10
months off treatment, respectively. Neuropathological evaluation
revealed viable PA or pilomyxoid astrocytoma in all specimens.

Progression-free Survival and Median Time to Progression
Nine participants experienced radiological tumor progression at a
median time of 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1–31.0 months), as illus-
trated in Figure 1. Rapid, accelerated tumor growth of an OPG on
sorafenib (patient 8) is illustrated in Figure 2.

Molecular Tumor Analysis
Results of testing for KIAA1549-BRAF by FISH and BRAFV600E by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct sequencing are summa-
rized in Table 2 and detailed in Table 4. Patients 3, 4, 5, and 7 had
tumor tissue available for molecular analysis prior to study entry.
In patients 1 and 2, tissue became available from surgery after
sorafenib. Patient 9 had tissue available for molecular studies
from a biopsy at initial diagnosis and surgical resection post sor-
afenib. Tumors from 4 participants (patients 1, 2, 7, and 9) were

tested prior to study entry, harbored a copy number gain at 7q34

full protocol dose with only minor (grades 1–2) expected toxici-
ties including rash (75.0%), dry skin (50.0%), hand-foot skin syn-
drome (33.3%), alanine aminotransferase (25.0%) or aspartate
aminotransferase (50.0%) elevation, fatigue (41.7%), alopecia
(41.7%), anorexia (25.0%), diarrhea (41.7%), hypophosphatemia
(33.3%), and lymphopenia (25.0%). Only one NF1 patient (patient
10) did not tolerate escalation to the full protocol dose due to
hand-foot skin reaction (maximum dose tolerated 80 mg/m2/
dose twice daily). Regarding the non-NF participants, only one
(patient 4) required permanent dose reductions due to toxicity,
(ie, hand-foot skin reaction) and required 2 dose level reductions
down to 100 mg/m2/dose once daily.

Pharmacokinetics
Informed consent/assent for PK blood sampling was provided by
7 evaluable participants. The median maximum plasma concen-
tration observed was 5.0 mg/mL, similar to prior pharmacokinetic
data from a pediatric phase I trial, which showed a median peak
plasma concentration at steady-state of 5.4+1.8 mg/mL at the
same dose level used in our study (ie, 200 mg/m2 twice daily).16

Sorafenib in Vitro Studies
NIH/3T3 cell lines stably expressing KIAA-BRAF fusion and wild-
type BRAF constructs exhibited dose-dependent resistance and en-
hanced paradoxical activation in the presence of sorafenib, as were
recently described for PLX4720, a research analog to the targeted
BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.23 Figure 3 demonstrates MAPK path-
way responsiveness in the presence of increasing concentrations
(0, 0.1, 1 mM) of the drug. Membrane signals for both phospho-MEK
1/2, and especially phospho-ERK 1/2, were raised in both KIAA-
BRAF fusion and full-length, wild-type BRAF-expressing cells.

Toxicity
Toxicity was assessed in all 12 enrolled participants who received
at least one dose of sorafenib. The only grade 4 toxicity possibly
related to sorafenib was an increase of alanine aminotransferase
in the context of developing urosepsis in patient NE1. Grade 3
toxicities included hand-foot skin syndrome (n ¼ 1) at the
end of cycle 9. Other grade 3 toxicities included diarrhea
(n ¼ 1), increased aspartate aminotransferase (n ¼ 1), headache
(n ¼ 1), and mucositis (n ¼ 1). Most participants tolerated the

Discussion
Although sorafenib was tolerated at the full protocol dose by
most participants with only minor (grades 1 and 2) expected tox-
icities, the most striking observation was the unexpectedly high
rate of early and rapid progression in the majority of PLGA pa-
tients (ie, 9 of 11 [81.8%]) within 3 treatment cycles. The ob-
served PFS was extremely short in these typically slow-growing
tumors, with a median time to progression of 2.8 months (95%
CI, 2.1 – 3.1 months). We also calculated median time to

and found it to be considerably higher (16 months), which was
consistent with our observation of accelerated tumor growth in
at least a subset of participants on sorafenib.

First-line chemotherapy in PLGA achieves objective response
rates in the range of 50%–60%,24,25 and regimens for recurrent/
progressive disease have reported an objective response rate of
36% and PFS at 5 years of 42% with vinblastine26 or stable disease
in at least 41% of patients with temozolomide.27 In comparison,
our results with sorafenib were far inferior and in striking contrast
to the observed 86% objective response rate in recurrent PLGAs
treated with bevacizumab.10

Because our only responder, patient 4, was negative for KIAA-
BRAF duplication and BRAFV600E, we performed additional molec-
ular testing to identify alternative oncogenic drivers. Targeted
sequencing of KRAS revealed wild-type, and IHC for phospho-PDGFR
was negative, consistent with absence of an FGFR1 activating
mutation.5 Further molecular analysis was not possible due to
exhaustion of the available tissue.

Since the time of conception of this study, our knowledge re-
garding the oncogenic drivers in PLGA, as well as our understanding

of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway inhibition with molecu-
lar targeted agents and resistance mechanisms, have increased
vastly. First, recent comprehensive genomic studies of PLGA
have uncovered alternative oncogenic mutations leading to
constitutive MAPK pathway activation in almost all PAs that do
not harbor KIAA-BRAF fusions, such as activating mutations in
FGFR1, NTRK2 and RAF1.4,5 Although PA represents a prototypic
“single pathway” tumor, these data indicate that pathway acti-
vation occurs through a number of different mechanisms and at
different levels along the pathway, with important implications
for rational drug selection. Second, our understanding of the
mechanisms of molecular targeted drug sensitivity and resis-
tance in tumors with oncogenic RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway ac-
tivation has evolved. We observed in vitro activation of MEK and
ERK signaling in the presence of sorafenib, providing a mechanis-
tic explanation for the observed rapid tumor progression in the
majority of PLGA patients treated with sorafenib on this study. A
comparable in vitro response at 1 mM was recently reported in a
melanoma cell line harboring a similar BRAF fusion.28 Corre-
spondingly, we have recently described similar paradoxical acti-
vation of MEK and ERK in KIAA-BRAF-expressing cells when

Other studies have also shown that RAF inhibitors can para-
doxically activate the MAPK signaling pathway and lead to treat-
ment resistance and/or tumor growth.29 – 32 In the presence of
oncogenic RAS, selective BRAF inhibitors promote RAS-dependent
BRAF binding and activation of CRAF, which in turn enhance
MEK-ERK signaling.32 Furthermore, although RAF inhibitors sup-
press ERK signaling in cells with mutant BRAF, signaling appears
to be ampliﬁed in cells with wild-type BRAF.30,31 Of note, paradox-
ical activation of ERK by sorafenib in the context of NF1 loss has
also been demonstrated in vitro,33 providing a possible explana-
tion for the rapid disease progression in the NF1 participants in-
cluded in our study.

In summary, our study shows that sorafenib is generally well
tolerated in PLGA patients but may promote accelerated tumor
growth. Results of in vitro testing indicate that sorafenib may
lead to paradoxical ERK activation in both BRAF wild-type and
KIAA-BRAF tumor cells as well as in NF1-deﬁcient cells. Further
preclinical data are required for a better understanding of the ef-
fects of molecular targeted agents on RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal-
ing and growth in PLGA. Molecular targeting downstream of
BRAF (ie, at the level of MEK) should be explored in future studies,
and a MEK inhibitor is currently being tested in a phase I study for
PLGA (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer NCT01089101). Importantly, re-
cent data indicate that differential activation of MEK in RAS versus
RAF-mutant tumors requires selection of speciﬁc subtypes of MEK
inhibitors based on the upstream oncogenic driver,34 which is
highly relevant to designing future MEK-inhibitor studies for
PLGA. Based on our experience, close clinical monitoring with im-
plementation of predetermined stopping rules for early tumor
progression should be standard in exploratory studies with
novel, molecular targeted agents, especially if tumor tissue is un-
available for molecular genetic testing.
