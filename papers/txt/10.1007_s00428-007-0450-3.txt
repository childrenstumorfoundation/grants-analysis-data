Abstract Approximately 5–10% of neuroendocrine tumors
(NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic system (GEP) have a
hereditary background. The known inherited syndromes
include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, neurofibroma-
tosis type 1, von Hippel–Lindau disease, and the tuberous
sclerosis complex. This review discusses for each of these
syndromes the: (1) involved genes and specific types of
mutations, (2) disease prevalence and penetrance, (3)
affected neuroendocrine tissues and related clinical syn-
dromes, (4) special morphological features of NETs and their
putative precursor lesions. In addition, GEP-NETs clustering
in individual families or associated with other malignancies
without known genetic background are discussed.

Introduction

Hereditary cancer susceptibility is more frequent and
variable in tumors of endocrine organs than in any other
category of human neoplasms. Often, a variety of endocrine
and nonendocrine tissues are involved, resulting in complex
clinical syndromes.

In the digestive tract, approximately 5–10% of neuroen-
docrine tumors (NETs) have a hereditary background.
Inherited tumor syndromes include multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1), von Hippel–Lindau disease (VHL), and the tuberous
sclerosis complex (TSC). In this article, we focus for each
of these syndromes on: (1) the involved genes and specific
types of mutations, (2) the disease prevalence and pene-
trance, (3) the affected neuroendocrine tissues and the
related clinical syndromes, and (4) the morphological
features of the respective NETs and their putative precursor
lesions. In addition, suspected hereditary backgrounds [e.g.,
association with other malignancies, familial clustering of
gastroenteropancreatic system (GEP)-NETs] are discussed.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1

MEN1 is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by
multifocal endocrine tumors affecting the anterior pituitary,
parathyroids, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, adrenal cortex,
thymus, and lungs. In addition, various uncommon tumoral
lesions may occur in the skin, central nervous system, and
soft tissues [12, 57].

The MEN1 gene is localized on chromosome 11q13 and
consists of 10 exons spanning approximately 9 kb of
genomic sequence and encoding a 68-kDa protein of 610
amino acids, named menin [12, 15, 57] (Table 1). Menin is

a cell cycle-regulated nuclear protein. Menin is assumed to
play an important role in pathways controlling cell growth
and differentiation during embryogenesis and postnatal life.
To date, menin has been shown to interact with numerous
proteins involved in regulation of
transcription, DNA
replication, mitosis, apoptosis, genome integrity, growth
factor signaling pathways, and extracellular matrix organi-
zation [12, 57]. However, it remains still unresolved why
MEN1 mutations affect primarily endocrine tissues.

The prevalence of the MEN1 syndrome has been
estimated to be between 1:20,000 and 1:40,000. In approx-
imately 10% of patients, MEN1 germline mutations arise de
novo without any family history [8, 12, 15] (Table 1). The
MEN1 germline mutations are found spread over the entire
exonic and intronic sequences and are not clustered in
hotspots. Approximately 60% are truncating mutations,
either frameshift (~40%) or nonsense (~20%) mutations;
20% are missense mutations; 10% are in-frame deletions or
insertions, and about 10% are intronic and splice-site
mutations. Large germline deletions encompassing the
whole MEN1 locus have also been detected [12, 14, 15].

Twenty to 60% of MEN1 patients suffer

A stringent genotype/phenotype relation correlation could
not be demonstrated. Among patients meeting the clinical
criteria of a MEN1 syndrome, approximately 10% have no
identifiable mutations [43]. Most MEN1-associated tumors
show somatic loss of the wild-type allele (loss of heterozy-
gosity; LOH) on chromosome 11q13, consistent with the
role of MEN1 as a tumor suppressor gene [6, 26, 54, 66].
from a
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (ZES), characterized by ele-
vated fasting gastrin serum levels, a positive secretin
stimulation test, and clinical symptoms such as recurrent
peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and
occasionally, diarrhea [44, 87]. The gastrinomas observed
in MEN1 are almost exclusively localized in the duodenum
(Table 1). They are multiple and are associated with
multifocal gastrin cell hyperplasia and tiny gastrin-producing
microtumors. Despite their small size of 0.3 to 5 mm, the
gastrinomas tend to metastasize to regional lymph nodes [3, 4,
67].

somatostatin cell neoplasms and multifocal somatostatin cell
hyperplasia [6] (Fig. 1). Recently, molecular studies have

tumor in a MEN1 patient with ZES (immunostaining for the vesicular

allowed the separation from hyperplastic and neoplastic
lesions. LOH of the MEN1 locus was found in approximate-
ly 50% of MEN1-associated duodenal NETs [6]. Allelic loss
was detected in tumors as small as 300 μm (gastrin) and
400 μm (somatostatin) in diameter, which therefore represent
true neoplasms. In contrast, hyperplastic gastrin and somato-
statin cells lacked LOH on chromosome 11q13. These
findings suggested that although the hyperplastic cells were
hyperproliferative and carried the MEN1 germline mutation,
they had not yet assumed the neoplastic genotype character-
ized by the loss of the MEN1 wild-type allele.

In addition to duodenal NETs, MEN1 patients with ZES
may show multiple gastric NETs of the enterochromaffin-
like (ECL) cells (Fig. 2). These tumors occur
in a
hypertrophic oxyntic mucosa and are associated with an
ECL cell hyperplasia, which can be visualized using
antisera against
the ECL cell-specific marker vesicular
monoamine transporter 2 [25] (Fig. 3). They are probably
induced by both the MEN1 germline mutation and the
trophic effect of hypergastrinemia. Metastases of these ECL

tumors are rare, and tumor-related deaths are the

cell
exception [9, 10, 12].

Pancreatic NETs lead to symptoms in 30–75% of MEN1
patients [12] and up to 10% of all pancreatic NETs may be
associated with a MEN1 syndrome [57]. In a recent study
on surgical specimens of the pancreas from MEN1 patients
in more than 90% of the cases, numerous microadenomas
(i.e., up to 5 mm in diameter) were found [5], a condition
that has been called pancreatic microadenomatosis. Al-
though this finding is a hallmark for MEN1, it is not MEN1
specific, as recently, pancreatic microadenomatosis charac-
terized by multiple glucagon-producing or multiple insulin-
producing microadenomas was described in several patients
who had no evidence of MEN1 or any other known
hereditary syndrome [5].

In MEN1 patients, the pancreatic microadenomas are
typically multihormonal and are often associated with one
or more macrotumors (diameter >5 mm; Fig. 4) [12, 42,

77]. The microadenomas in MEN1 are characterized,
irrespective of their size (i.e., less than 200 μm), by the
following features: (1) frequent expression of glucagon and/
or pancreatic polypeptide, (2) trabecular growth pattern,
and (3) a distinct stromal component [5, 42, 77]. Their
neoplastic nature was demonstrated by LOH of the MEN1
gene [66, 82]. The MEN1-associated macrotumors (≥5 mm)
also frequently express glucagon and pancreatic polypep-
tide or, rarely, somatostatin. In all these cases, the patients
do not have a hormonal syndrome. However, if one of the
macrotumors produces insulin, the patient presents with a
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia syndrome. This is seen in
approximately 10–25% of the cases. Only exceptionally,
there are macrotumors that express hormones such as
gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, or growth hor-
mone releasing hormone, which then may give rise to the
respective hormonal syndromes. Regarding MEN1 patients
with ZES, this implies that, with all likelihood, the source
of hypergastrinemia is not a pancreatic gastrinoma but
multiple duodenal gastrinomas.

islet-like endocrine cell clusters [66].

Recently, forerunners of microadenomas were identified
in the MEN1 pancreas, which have been called mono-
hormononal
In
addition, single irregularly shaped and enlarged islets with
an increased number of glucagon cells were found.
However,
islet-like
endocrine cell clusters, the cells of the glucagon-cell-rich
islets show retention of heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene
and are therefore still nonneoplastic in nature.

in contrast

to the monohormononal

In summary, the MEN1 syndrome is characterized by
multiple endocrine duodenal and pancreatic NETs express-
ing several peptide hormones, but preferentially either
gastrin or somatostatin (duodenum) or glucagon or pancre-
atic polypeptide (pancreas). The duodenal NETs are
associated with multifocal gastrin and somatostatin cell
hyperplasia that can be considered precursor lesions. In the
pancreas, the islets with hyperplastic glucagon cells are
probably the precursors from which microadenomas
evolve. Similar precursor changes have so far not been
observed in the usually solitary nonhereditary NETs [6].

Neurofibromatosis type 1

NF1 (i.e., von Recklinghausen disease) shows an autosomal-
dominant inheritance and a high penetrance: In almost all
patients, there is sufficient evidence of the disorder to allow
diagnosis in childhood [27]. The condition is characterized
by neurofibromas, Café au lait patches of the skin, and
bone dysplasia. Neurofibromas occur widely throughout the
body, but affect mainly the skin. Other tumors are optic
nerve and brain stem gliomas, pheochromocytomas, and
malignant nerve sheath tumors [27] (Table 1). Gastro-

enteropancreatic NETs are rare and occur in 1% of the NF1
patients. They typically arise in the duodenum [23].

The NF1 gene is localized on chromosome 17q11.2 and
consists of more than 50 exons spanning approximately
300 kb of genomic sequence and encoding a 327-kDa
protein of 2,818 amino acids, called neurofibromin [81].
Neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of the ras-related
G-proteins by increasing Ras GTPase activity, and thereby,
functions at multiple levels: transcription, cell proliferation,
cytoskeletal microtubule assembly. Mice that are homozy-
gous for an NF1 mutation fail
to develop the normal
structure of heart and various neuroectodermal tissues and
die in utero [27, 86]. Neurofibromin has been referred to as
a tumor suppressor, as malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors in NF1 patients display LOH of the NF1 gene [27].
Mutation screening is costly and not recommended
clinically because of the size of the gene (50 exons) and
the fact that the clinical manifestations are so characteristic.
Mutations have been identified throughout the NF1 gene;
most mutations are protein-truncating mutations, consisting
of nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations. Five to
10% of patients have large deletions, often involving the
whole gene, that are easily detectable by fluorescence in
situ hybridization [36]. Large deletions of the NF1 gene
have been correlated with a greater neurofibroma burden, as
well as dysmorphic features, greater mental retardation, and
a higher risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors [27]. Except for large deletions, genotype–
phenotype correlations have not been described.

Our knowledge about

the incidence, histopathology,
biology, and functional activity of NF1-associated intestinal
NETs is based on reports of single cases or small series of
patients and reviews [22, 23, 75, 76]. Most of the GEP-
NETs arise in the ampullary region of the duodenum and
show glandular structures containing PAS-positive psam-
moma bodies. Immunohistochemically,
they consistently
express somatostatin and synaptophysin, but rarely chro-
mogranin A. An association with the so-called somatosta-
tinoma syndrome [i.e., markedly elevated somatostatin
levels in the plasma and/or tumor, diabetes mellitus of
recent onset, hypochlorhydria, gallbladder disease (choleli-
thiasis), diarrhea and steatorrhea, anemia, and weight loss]
[24] has yet not been described. The clinical symptoms are
caused by the site of the tumors, i.e., the ampulla, and lead
to obstructive jaundice, intestinal obstruction, and/or bleed-
ing. In our series of 82 duodenal NETs, we identified 15
somatostatin-producing NETs (SOM-NETs), 3 of them
associated with the NF1 syndrome (Fig. 5). None of these
tumors was associated with a somatostatinoma syndrome.
Therefore,
the high rate of NF1-associated SOM-NETs
reviewed by Soga and Yakuwa [74] could not be confirmed
in our series. Precursor lesions of NF1-associated SOM-
NETs have not been identified. NF1-associated SOM-NETs

(Fig. 5). In addition, gangliocytic paragangliomas and
ampullary adenocarcinomas have been reported; however,
it remains unclear whether these tumors are coincidental or
due to the NF1 germline mutations.

Metastases have been described in 27% of SOM-NETs,
mainly to the lymph nodes. They appear
to be less
aggressive than their sporadically occurring duodenal and
pancreatic counterparts [35]. A tumor size of more than
2 cm and infiltration of the outer smooth muscle layers
increase the risk of metastases ([76] and personal observa-
tions). In addition, a few cases of pancreatic NETs have
been described in patients with the NF1 syndrome. These
were somatostatin-producing NETs or insulinomas [29, 73,
74]. In our series of 541 non-MEN1-associated pancreatic
NETs, we identified 19 somatostatin-producing NETs, none
of them associated with NF1, and 162 insulinomas, one of

them in a patient with NF1. In this patient, the tumor was
proven to lack expression of the wild-type NF1 allele,
providing strong evidence that
there is indeed a close
relationship between NF1 and the development of this
insulinoma [65].

von Hippel–Lindau syndrome

VHL is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome
caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor
gene. VHL disease shows marked phenotypic variability
and age-dependent penetrance [55, 84] (Table 2).

The VHL gene is localized on chromosome 3p25 and
consists of three exons encoding two VHL transcripts. The
major transcript (isoform I) represents all
three exons,
whereas exon 2 is absent from isoform II. They encode two

gene products: a full-length 213-amino-acid protein
(pVHL30; ~28–30 kDa) and a shorter protein (pVHL19;
~18–19 kDa). The VHL gene product has multiple
functions, the best characterized of which is the role of
pVHL in regulating proteolytic degradation of the subunits
of the HIF transcription factors. In addition, there is strong
evidence that pVHL targets other proteins for polyubiqui-
nation [18, 48, 53, 55]. VHL-associated tumors such as
renal clear cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheo-
chromocytoma are highly vascular and overexpress a wide
range of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs,
including vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor. A
variety of VHL mutations have been described. Large
genomic deletions account for up to 40% of all mutations,
and the rest are divided approximately equally between
intragenic missense mutations and protein-truncating muta-
tions (nonsense, frameshift insertions and deletions, splice-
site mutations). Germline VHL mutations have been

characterized in >500 patients and have provided a wealth
of data for genotype–phenotype correlations. VHL muta-
tions may cause (1) VHL diseases, (2) isolated familial
pheochromocytoma (VHL disease type 2C), and (3)
autosomal recessively inherited polycythemia due to ho-
mozygous missense mutations [17, 19, 55, 69, 84].

Although pancreatic involvement

in VHL is very
common (50–77%), the majority of lesions are cysts. These
are rarely of clinical significance, and impairment of
pancreatic function is uncommon. Hemangioblastoma
occurs rarely in the pancreas of VHL patients [34, 55, 62].
The prevalence of pancreatic NETs in VHL patients has
been reported at frequencies of 5–17%. VHL-associated
NETs are usually confined to the pancreas and show a
solid, trabecular, and/or glandular architecture. In approx-
imately 30–50% of VHL patients, the tumors are multiple.
Most of them reveal clear-cell cytology. Immunohisto-
chemically, they are positive for general neuroendocrine

markers (chromogranin A and synaptophysin). A minor
subset of tumor cells may be immunoreactive for pancreatic
polypeptide, glucagon, somatostatin, or insulin. Clinically,
however, almost all of the tumors are functionally inactive
and are usually detected by routine radiological assessment
of the abdomen in VHL patients [1, 51, 52, 54, 55]. Almost
all VHL-related pancreatic NETs reveal LOH of the VHL
gene locus on chromosome 3p25, supporting the concept
that the VHL gene product acts as a tumor suppressor [54].
Although VHL-related tumors are often multifocal, precur-
sor lesions were not identified in a systematic analysis of 14
patients [54]. VHL-related pancreatic NETs grow slowly.
As with other NETs, the risk of malignancy seems to be
directly proportional to the diameter of the tumor. In the
largest reported series of 30 patients, the median size of the
tumor in patients with no metastases was 2 cm (n=25)
compared to 5 cm for those with metastases (n=5) [51].

Tuberous sclerosis complex

Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal-dominant genetic
disorder with a prevalence of 1:10,000 and a disease
penetrance of approximately 100%. TSC is a multisystem
disorder exhibiting a wide range of manifestations charac-
terized by hamartomatous lesions in the brain, skin, eyes,
heart,
lungs, and kidneys (Table 2). Epilepsy, mental
retardation, and autism are often present. A few cases of
pancreatic NETs have been described in patients with TSC.
TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1
gene at 9q34 or the TSC2 gene at 16p13.3 encoding the
proteins hamartin (~140 kDa) and tuberin (~200 kDa),
which form a complex that affects cell growth, differenti-
ation, and proliferation [70, 71, 78, 85] (Table 2). The
diagnosis of TSC is usually based on the clinical and
radiological findings. Two thirds of the cases result from
new dominant mutations. Clinical manifestations may vary,
but there is no well-documented report on nonpenetrance.
The TSC1/TSC2 dimer mediates a key step in the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. Thereby,
the TSC1/TSC2 complex is involved in the regulation of
the activity of mTOR, a master controller of protein
translation,
integrating information on growth stimuli,
cellular energy levels, nutrient availability, hypoxia, and
cell growth [47, 49, 68, 79].

Mutations of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes were detected
throughout the genes, with some clustering but no striking
hotspots, and include inactivating nonsense, frameshift, and
splice-site mutations. For TSC2, additionally in-frame
deletions and large deletions involving the adjacent PKD1
gene have been reported. Somatic mosaicism occurs in a
minority of patients with TSC and seems to be associated
with a milder phenotype. Several studies showed that

sporadic TSC2 mutations tend to be associated with a more
severe phenotype than sporadic mutations of the TSC1
gene [20, 39, 46, 50]. Among patients meeting the clinical
criteria of TSC, 15–20% have no identifiable mutations.
These persons generally have milder clinical disease [20,
72]. Somatic mutations often involving large deletions
spanning the gene (LOH) account for the majority of
tumors occurring in TSC, following Knudsen’s two-hit
paradigm for tumor suppressor genes [30, 31, 85].

Pancreatic NETs have rarely been described in adults with
TSC [21, 28, 33, 38, 41, 80]. In a case report analyzing a 6-
year-old child with a de novo mutation of the TSC2 gene,
who suffered from an endocrinologically silent malignant
pancreatic NET, 16p13 LOH and absence of tuberin protein
expression from the tumor were demonstrated [28]. These
findings provide evidence for a role of tuberin in the
pathogenesis of pancreatic NETs. Based on the small series
of reported cases, pancreatic TSC-associated pancreatic
NETs are insulinomas or endocrinologically silent. Some of
them are malignant. Interestingly, in a postmortem series of
nine TSC patients, one 21-year-old woman was found to
have an incidental nonfunctioning pancreatic NET in
association with multiple endocrine adenomas of
the
pituitary gland, adrenal, and parathyroid glands [38].

GEP-NETs with suspected hereditary background

Data regarding an association of GEP-NETs with other
malignancies are limited. In the older literature, several
studies indicated that patients with intestinal NETs are at
increased risk for developing another primary malignancy
[11, 45, 61]. Chen et al. [16] postulated that
intestinal
adenocarcinomas and intestinal NETs might have common
endogenous or environmental risk factors. Kothari and
Mangla [45] found that 36% of patients with ileal NETs
(carcinoids) had an associated malignancy. However, these
results could not be confirmed by two large population
studies that included 1,029 and 245 patients from Denmark
and the USA, respectively, and failed to confirm a general
excess cancer risk in patients with GEP-NETs [7, 83].

Case reports described ileal and rectal NETs in first-
degree relatives without any evidence of a known inherited
disease [2, 56, 60, 64]. These observations were also
confirmed in a large study including 245 patients with
intestinal NETs in which 3.7% of patients had at least one
first-degree relative with the same malignancy [7]. This rate
was found to be much higher than age-adjusted incidence
rates for intestinal endocrine tumors (p<0.00001 small
bowel; p=0.008 large intestine). The findings of this study
were confirmed by a nationwide epidemiological study
from Sweden including 1,933 offspring and 4,713 parents
with endocrine tumors at various sites [37]. Similar findings

S36

Virchows Arch (2007) 451 (Suppl 1):S29–S38

were reported in four families suffering from lung NETs
[63]. None of these studies identified environmental risk
factors, which suggests a genetic background for
the
familial clustering of intestinal NETs that remains to be
analyzed in detail.

Further clustering of intestinal NETs was very well
established in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [13,
32, 58]. In addition, some case reports described GEP-NETs
in patients suffering from familial adenomatous polyposis
[40, 59]. However, for both conditions, it remains to be
clarified whether and how a hereditary predisposition exists.
