Abstract

Porcupine (PORCN) is a membrane bound O-acyltransferase that is required for Wnt palmitoylation, secretion,
and biologic activity. All evaluable human Wnts require PORCN for their activity, suggesting that inhibition of
PORCN could be an effective treatment for cancers dependent on excess Wnt activity. In this study, we evaluated
the PORCN inhibitor Wnt-C59 (C59), to determine its activity and toxicity in cultured cells and mice. C59 inhibits
PORCN activity in vitro at nanomolar concentrations, as assessed by inhibition of Wnt palmitoylation, Wnt
interaction with the carrier protein Wntless/WLS, Wnt secretion, and Wnt activation of b-catenin reporter
activity. In mice, C59 displayed good bioavailability, as once daily oral administration was sufﬁcient to maintain
blood concentrations well above the IC50. C59 blocked progression of mammary tumors in MMTV-WNT1
transgenic mice while downregulating Wnt/b-catenin target genes. Surprisingly, mice exhibit no apparent
toxicity, such that at a therapeutically effective dose there were no pathologic changes in the gut or other tissues.
These results offer preclinical proof-of-concept that inhibiting mammalian Wnts can be achieved by targeting
PORCN with small-molecule inhibitors such as C59, and that this is a safe and feasible strategy in vivo. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling cascade has been
implicated in multiple disorders including cancer, vascular
proliferation, and tissue ﬁbrosis. Wnt autocrine loops and
paracrine Wnt secretion from stroma have been shown in
multiple settings, even in diseases such as colon cancer that
have mutations in downstream components of the Wnt/
b-catenin pathway (1, 2). Wnts are upregulated in colorectal
cancer cells with mutant APC, in breast cancer cell lines, and
in multiple sarcomas (2, 3). The Wnt pathway is activated in
several cancers by inactivating mutations in the ubiquitin
ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3 that normally downregulate
the Wnt receptor Frizzled, and in colorectal cancers by
R-spondin gene fusions (4–7). In addition, negative regula-
tors of the Wnt pathway, such as sFRP1 and Dkk1, are
epigenetically silenced in multiple cancers. Wnts secreted

from cancer cells (8), stromal myoﬁbroblasts (9), and
immune cells (10) have been implicated in the process of
tumorigenesis and metastasis. If these pathways are impor-
tant in cancer proliferation and spread, then inhibitors of
Wnts may have value as anticancer agents. Speciﬁc targeted
therapies against Wnts and their
including
recombinant Wnt antagonists such as decoy receptors and
monoclonal antibodies against individual Wnts, have shown
activity in selected settings (8, 11, 12). However, such
approaches presuppose a knowledge of which Wnts are
important in any given tumor.

receptors,

An alternative approach to inhibit Wnt autocrine and para-
crine signaling is to block the production of all active Wnts.
This can be achieved by targeting a key enzyme in Wnt
biosynthesis, the membrane bound O-acyltransferase PORCN.
PORCN makes a good target because it is essential for the O-
palmitoylation of all human Wnts (13–16). PORCN resides in
the endoplasmic reticulum, where it adds palmitate to a serine
(S209 in human WNT3A) that is completely conserved in all
vertebrate Wnts (16). Acylation of S209 is required for the next
step in Wnt secretion, binding to the carrier protein WLS (17).
Palmitoylation is also essential for WNT to interact with
Frizzled receptors outside the cell (13, 18). While genetic
ablation of PORCN slows the growth of some tumor lines in
vitro, PORCN has additional nonenzymatic functions that
complicate tests of its role in cancer via a knockout or RNA
interference approach (19). As an enzyme, PORCN is an
attractive target for small-molecule inhibitors (20–22). Sup-
porting this, we have recently reported that all mammalian
Wnt signaling is sensitive to PORCN expression levels, and that
small changes in PORCN activity can have signiﬁcant effects on

PORCN Inhibition Blocks Cancer Growth

Results
C59 is a potent inhibitor of PORCN enzymatic activity
The small-molecule 2-(4-(2-methylpyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-N-
(4-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl) acetamide was recently developed and
patented by Novartis as a Wnt signaling modulator (25). It is
commercially available under the name C59 from at least 2
sources (Cellagen Technology and Biovision), and is claimed to
inhibit PORCN enzyme activity at nanomolar concentrations.
However, there is no peer-reviewed published information on
its efﬁcacy and molecular target. Because a potent, bioavail-
able, and stable PORCN inhibitor is not yet available we
evaluated C59. We ﬁnd that C59 indeed functions as a bona
ﬁde PORCN inhibitor using a number of cell-based assays. C59
inhibits WNT3A-mediated activation of a multimerized TCF-
binding site driving luciferase (Super8xTopFlash; STF) with an
IC50 of 74 pmol/L (Fig. 1A). As expected for a PORCN inhibitor,
Wnt secretion into culture medium is completely abrogated by
C59 treatment (Fig. 1A, inset). Consistent with C59 targeting
PORCN, overexpression of PORCN rescues the inhibition of
WNT3A-mediated STF activity, similar to that of an unrelated
PORCN inhibitor IWP-1 (refs. 21, 22; Fig. 1B). Wnt acylation is
required for binding to the carrier protein WLS (15, 17).
WNT3A and WNT8A coimmunoprecipitate with WLS, but this
interaction is blocked when cells have been pretreated with
C59 (Fig. 1C). Using alkyne palmitic acid and click chemistry

developmental phenotypes (14, 15). A Novartis PORCN inhib-
itor, LGK974, is in early-phase clinical trials (NCT01351103)
although no peer-reviewed published information is available
regarding its activity or efﬁcacy. The development of PORCN
inhibitors offers the opportunity to directly test if PORCN is a
useful target in Wnt-dependent cancers in vivo.

Materials and Methods

Extensive additional experimental details are in Supplemen-

tal Material.

Reagents

HT1080 and HeLa cells were acquired from the American
Type Culture Collection. Cell lines were not tested for authen-
ticity. STF3a cells were previously reported (17). Wnt-C59 was
purchased from Cellagen Technology, and is reported in U.S.
patent WO/2010/101849. w-alkynyl palmitic acid (Alk-C16)
was synthesized as previously reported (23, 24).

Administration of C59 to mice

C59 was resuspended by sonication for 20 minutes in a
mixture of 0.5% methylcellulose and 0.1% Tween-80 for oral
administration. MMTV-WNT1 mice were obtained from Jack-
son Laboratories and backcrossed at least 6 generations to
C57/BL6 mice.

Figure 1. C59 is a bona ﬁde inhibitor of PORCN activity. A, C59 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. HEK293 cells constitutively expressing WNT3A
and the b-catenin reporter STF were treated with C59 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After 48 hours, luciferase activity was measured. Error bars represent SD.
Structure of C59 is shown above. Inset, WNT3A secretion into culture medium was blocked by 0.1 nmol/L C59. Uncut immunoblots are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1A. B, PORCN overexpression reverses the effects of C59. HT1080 cells were transfected with empty vector (EV) or mPORCN-D
expression plasmids followed by treatment with C59 (1 nmol/L) or IWP1 (1 mmol/L). Luciferase activity was measured after 24 hours. Error bars represent SD.
C, C59 blocks the palmitoylation-dependent Wnt–WLS interaction. HeLa cells were transfected with either WNT3A-V5 or WNT8A-V5 plasmids, then treated
with DMSO or C59 (10 nmol/L). WLS was immunoprecipitated and precipitates were probed for WLS and V5. Uncut immunoblots are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1B. D, C59 blocks palmitoylation of Wnts. Alk-C16 was added to HeLa cells transfected with WNT3A-V5 and cotreated with either DMSO, C59
(100 nmol/L), or IWP1 (1 mmol/L). Lysates were prepared and Wnt was immunoprecipitated with antibody to V5. Click chemistry was conducted to attach
azido-biotin to alkyne-palmitate groups. Finally, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for biotin and WNT3A-V5. This result was reproduced in
HT1080 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C).

(23, 24), we ﬁnd that C59 prevents incorporation of palmitate
into WNT3A, consistent with inhibition of PORCN activity (Fig.
1D). C59 inhibits the activity of all splice variants of murine
PORCN (Fig. 2A). In preliminary studies, we found that very
high concentrations of C59 were required to produce devel-
opmental phenotypes in Xenopus embryogenesis. Consistent
with this, while Xenopus laevis PORCN was active when
expressed in PORCN-null human cells, its activity was resistant
to inhibition by C59 (Fig. 2A). Because the Xenopus protein is
77% identical to human PORCN, this provides genetic evidence
that PORCN is the molecular target of C59, suggests a mech-

Figure 2. C59 is a general mammalian PORCN/WNT inhibitor. A, all
PORCN isoforms are inhibited by C59. PORCN-null HT1080 cells (14)
were transfected with 200 pg of the indicated PORCN expression
plasmids, along with WNT3A, STF reporter, and mCherry as transfection
control. Six hours after transfection, cells were treated with C59 or DMSO
as indicated and the following day assayed for luciferase. Xenopus
PORCN was resistant to the inhibitory effects of C59. B, all canonical
Wnts are inhibited by C59. STF luciferase assay was conducted as in A
except with wild-type HT1080 cells. Data is presented as fold activation

DMSO. Data is presented as mean  SD. C, noncanonical Wnts are

anism for C59 drug resistance to emerge, and indicates that less
related MBOAT proteins would also be unaffected by C59.
Showing that inhibition of PORCN is likely to prevent all Wnt-
mediated signaling, we found that 9 of 9 b-catenin activating
Wnts and 4 of 4 additional noncanonical Wnts lost activity
when cells were treated with C59 (Fig. 2B and C). In summary,
C59 is a nanomolar inhibitor of mammalian PORCN acyltrans-
ferase activity and blocks activation of all evaluated human
Wnts. Thus, we anticipate that C59 administration will prevent
all human and murine Wnt-dependent signaling.

Wnt autocrine loops have been reported in multiple cancer
cell lines, and secreted Wnt inhibitors like sFRPs and Frzb have
growth inhibitory effects on cancer cell lines as well (2, 11, 26,
27). We therefore assessed the effects of C59 on cancer cell
proliferation in vitro. C59 does not signiﬁcantly inhibit the
proliferation of any of 46 tested cancer cell lines in vitro at
concentrations that completely inhibit PORCN (Supplemen-
tary Table S1). Inhibition of proliferation of a few cell lines at
more than 1.5 mmol/L (20,000-fold above the IC50) is likely to be
a cell-type–speciﬁc off-target effect. This overall lack of toxicity
indicates that Wnt secretion is not essential for most cells to
proliferate in 2-dimensional culture. Our results with C59 differ
from studies on the inhibitory effects of secreted Wnt inhibi-
tors on proliferation, which we speculate may be due to the
reported additional activities of these inhibitors beyond the
Wnt pathway (28).

C59 can be administered to mice and prevents tumor
growth

To test the role of Wnt signaling in vivo, we assessed the
bioavailability and in vivo half-life of C59 in mice. After either
intravenous (2.5 mg/kg) or oral administration (5 mg/kg), the
compound half-life in blood was approximately 1.94 hours.
Notably, C59 concentration remained greater than 10-fold
above the in vitro IC50 for at least 16 hours following a single
oral dose (Fig. 3A). On the basis of the pharmacokinetic
proﬁling, C59 was administered once daily to test its efﬁcacy
in treating established Wnt-driven tumors. In mice carrying a
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-WNT1 transgene,
overexpression of murine WNT1 causes a high incidence of
mammary adenocarcinomas beginning at 10 weeks of age (29).
Notably, tumors arising in these mice remain Wnt dependent
but have diverse molecular phenotypes and growth rates
consistent with the hypothesis that WNT1 expands a vulner-
able population that then undergoes second hits (30, 31).

To test the in vivo efﬁcacy of C59, we transplanted fragments
from 2 independent primary MMTV-WNT1 tumors orthoto-
pically into nude mice. Following development of palpable
tumors, mice were treated with either vehicle or C59, 10 mg/
kg/d for 17 days. C59 administration arrested or reversed
tumor growth in all treated mice (n ¼ 22; Fig. 3B). After 17
days of treatment, the tumors were removed and further
analyzed. Final tumor weights were signiﬁcantly different (Fig.
3C). To conﬁrm that C59 was active in immunocompetent
mice, we monitored a colony of female nulliparous Bl6 MMTV-
WNT1 mice for tumor development. When tumors became
palpable, the mice were treated with either vehicle or C59
(5 mg/kg/d). While the number of mice enrolled in this study

was smaller, again even the lower dose of C59 signiﬁcantly
blocked tumor growth (Fig. 3D). Final tumor weights are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A.

Tumor growth inhibition is associated with decreased
Wnt/b-catenin signaling in tumors

To determine whether the inhibition of tumor growth
was accompanied by inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling,
we examined the expression of selected target genes in the
allograft and primary tumors by quantitative reverse-tran-
scription PCR (qRT-PCR). Axin2, Ccnd1, c-Myc, and Tcf7 tran-
scripts were signiﬁcantly reduced in tumors from mice treated
with C59 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2B). Consistent with
a decrease in c-Myc and CyclinD, treated tumors also had
signiﬁcantly decreased proliferation as indicated by Ki67 stain-
ing (Fig. 4B).

A major function of WNT1 is inhibition of the b-catenin
destruction complex, and consistent with this, vehicle-treated
tumors had abundant b-catenin in cytoplasm and nucleus. In
contrast, tumors from C59-treated mice had normal mem-
brane b-catenin staining and markedly decreased cytoplasmic
and nuclear b-catenin (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S3).
Suggesting C59 is not toxic to normal tissues at this dose, mice

in the treatment group had stable body weight (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Moreover, no signs of toxicity were observed in the
multiple tissues histologically examined at the end of the study
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, treated mice had normal
intestinal morphology and nuclear b-catenin staining was
maintained in the crypts (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion

In this study, we conﬁrm that the small-molecule C59 is a
nanomolar inhibitor of the acyltransferase activity of PORCN,
and show that small-molecule–mediated inhibition of PORCN
is an effective means for preventing WNT1-driven tumor
growth in mice. C59 inhibits palmitoylation of Wnts and is
not active against Xenopus PORCN. Thus, changes in the
primary sequence of PORCN confer resistance to C59, con-
ﬁrming genetically that PORCN is the target of C59. C59 is more
than100-fold more potent than the previously reported PORCN
inhibitor IWP1. We ﬁnd no apparent toxicity to cells or mice at
a drug concentration that effectively inhibits MMTV-WNT1–
driven tumor growth. Intestinal architecture of treated mice
appears normal. A similar lack of intestinal toxicity was seen
when Wnt signaling was inhibited with Fzd8CRD-Fc (11). We
speculate that Wnt-addicted tumors are hypersensitive to

small reductions in Wnt activity, whereas normal tissues such
as intestine are more tolerant of decreases in Wnt signals and/
or have alternative pathways for self-renewal.

The Wnt pathways contribute to the progression of various
cancers, via both b-catenin–activating mutations and by para-
crine and autocrine Wnt signaling. Increased Wnt production
has also been identiﬁed in diverse nonmalignant diseases. In
many cases, the implicated Wnts may be working via non-
b-catenin pathways. PORCN inhibitors may therefore have
efﬁcacy even in diseases without activated b-catenin. Thus, it
is a longstanding goal to identify therapeutics that can effectively
target this pathway. Our recent work has conﬁrmed that PORCN
is a key node for ﬁne control of total Wnt-dependent cell
signaling, further supporting its use as a target (14, 15). As such,
speciﬁc and bioavailable inhibitors of PORCN represent attrac-
tive new molecules that may be of value in the treatment of
various cancers, in addition to other Wnt-stimulated diseases.
