In this pilot study, we examined training eﬀects of a computerized working memory program on resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures in children with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). We
contrasted pre- with post-training resting state fMRI and cognitive measures from 16 participants (nine males;
11.1 ± 2.3 years) with NF1 and documented working memory diﬃculties. Using non-parametric permutation
test inference, we found signiﬁcant regionally speciﬁc diﬀerences (family-wise error corrected) in two of four
voxel-wise resting state measures: fractional amplitude of low frequency ﬂuctuations (indexing peak-to-trough
intensity of spontaneous oscillations) and regional homogeneity (indexing local intrinsic synchrony). Some
cognitive task improvement was observed as well. These preliminary ﬁndings suggest that regionally speciﬁc
changes in resting state fMRI indices may be associated with treatment-related cognitive amelioration in NF1.
Nevertheless, current results must be interpreted with caution pending independent controlled replication.

1. Introduction

Although cognitive deﬁcits in attention, working memory and ex-
ecutive function are among the most impairing consequences of neu-
roﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) (Acosta et al., 2006; Schwetye and
Gutmann, 2014), evidence-based, eﬀective interventions that improve
or restore cognitive function in NF1 remain lacking. Computerized
cognitive training programs may augment cognitive abilities through
repeated practice of mental exercises with increasing diﬃculty as per-
formance improves (e.g., Klingberg et al., 2005). Cogmed [www.
cogmed.com] is a computerized visuo-spatial training regimen ad-
ministered at home and supplemented by remote coaching sessions
(Astle et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2009; Olesen et al., 2004). In devel-
opmental and acquired attentional disorders, Cogmed gains have been
reported to be sustainable for months and to span across multiple

cognitive measures, including certain untrained tasks (Astle et al.,
2015; Conklin et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2009; Stevens et al., 2016).
Consistent with training-induced neural plasticity (Kelly and
Castellanos, 2014), Cogmed interventions may modulate blood-oxyge-
nation level-dependent (BOLD) signals during tasks probing working
memory and cognitive control (Olesen et al., 2004; Stevens et al.,
2016). Such training eﬀects tend to manifest as increased prefrontal
activity as well as enhanced connectivity within prefrontal cortex, and
between prefrontal and parietal regions (for review see, Constantinidis
and Klingberg, 2016; Nee et al., 2013). For instance, in typically de-
veloping children, ages 8–11, Cogmed training has been found to in-
duce intrinsic functional connectivity alterations between fronto-par-
ietal and ventral visual areas (Astle et al., 2015).

While the neural correlates of NF1 are understudied, aberrant re-
cruitment of visual and default mode network regions in response to

checkerboards has been reported in children and in adults with NF1
(Violante et al., 2012). Preliminary evidence suggests that resting state
(i.e., task-free) BOLD activity patterns in NF1 may be modiﬁable (e.g.,
by pharmacological treatment: Chabernaud et al., 2012). Relative to
healthy controls, abnormal resting state functional connectivity has also
been identiﬁed in NF1 (Loitfelder et al., 2015; Tomson et al., 2015).

This pilot open-label, prospective pre-/post-test study assessed
training eﬀects of Cogmed on resting state fMRI measures in 16 NF1
patients (aged 8–15 years) with marked working memory deﬁcits. We
sought to identify reliable regionally speciﬁable changes in spontaneous
BOLD ﬂuctuations by contrasting pre- with post-treatment resting state
scans. Accordingly, we performed univariate voxel-wise analyses on a
set of four indices of spontaneous resting state activity that have been
used previously to examine neural correlates of working memory in
typically developing children and adolescents (Yang et al., 2015), in-
cluding two regional measures – fractional amplitude of low frequency
ﬂuctuations (fALFF, Zou et al., 2008) and regional homogeneity (ReHo,
Zang et al., 2004). Additionally, to probe behavioral improvement,
standardized Cogstate tasks (Maruﬀ et al., 2009) were administered
before and after Cogmed training completion.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Children with NF1 (age range: 8–15 years) were identiﬁed through
an institutional NF1 clinical database with approval of the Children's
Health System Institutional Review Board. After obtaining written in-
formed consent and assent, children's intellectual, working memory and
executive function skills were assessed. Participation was limited to
children who exhibited working memory diﬃculties, speciﬁcally (1)
score ≥ 1 SD below the population mean on the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children-IV (Wechsler, 2004) Working Memory Index or (2) T-
score ≥ 75th percentile on the Metacognition index of the parent-re-
ported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (Gioia et al.,
2000). Exclusionary criteria included: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of
Intelligence (Wechsler, 1999) estimated full-scale IQ < 70; motor, vi-
sual or auditory handicaps preventing computer use; a DSM-IV Axis I
diagnosis that would take treatment precedence over cognitive training
needs; history of photosensitive seizures; change in type or dose of
psychotropic medication within the last 30 days; and chemotherapy for
a brain tumor.

Qualifying children underwent resting state fMRI scans and a cog-
nitive test battery (i.e., Cogstate testing; see 2.3) before and after
completing Cogmed training, which resulted in 20 complete datasets.
The at-home standard Cogmed training under parental supervision
lasted ~25 sessions over 6–10 consecutive weeks. Weekly coaching
phone calls by study staﬀ were intended to troubleshoot potential
problems and reinforce compliance. Algorithmic adaptive adjustment
of training item diﬃculty on a trial-by-trial basis was used to ensure
that performance was continually challenged over the course of each
30–45 min training session. While a blinded, placebo-controlled study
would have allowed inferences about eﬃcacy and speciﬁcity, the pri-
mary goal of this pilot study was to determine whether reliable neural
changes could be detected after computerized cognitive training in in-
dividuals with NF1. Accordingly, like previous clinical trials in atten-
tional disorders (e.g., Stevens et al., 2016), we pursued an open-label
approach.

Next, neuroimaging data quality was assessed. Inclusion required
anatomical scans that passed visual quality assurance for signal drop-
out and motion artifacts and functional scans with acceptable head
motion, i.e., mean frame-wise displacement (FDmean) ≤ 0.5 mm (Power
et al., 2014), as computed using Jenkinson's formula (Jenkinson et al.,
2002). This criterion yielded 16 subjects (nine males, mean age:
11.1 ± 2.3 years, range: 8–15 years, see Table 1 for participant char-
acteristics) with usable pre- and post-Cogmed data (maximal FDmean =

2.2. Neuroimaging data

2.2.1. Data acquisition

We obtained T1-weighted anatomical

images (sagittal 3D fast
spoiled gradient echo sequence: TR = 7.8 ms; TE = 30 ms; TI =
450 ms; ﬂip angle = 12°; voxel-size = 0.923 mm × 0.923 mm ×
1.0 mm) and functional T2*-weighted resting state scans (echo planar
images: TR = 2500 ms; TE = 25 ms; ﬂip angle = 90°; 38 slices; voxel-
size = 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm × 3 mm; 150 time-points) using a GE 3 T
scanner equipped with an 8-channel head coil.

2.2.2. Data pre-processing

automated Conﬁgurable Pipeline

Pre-processing was carried out using the open-source, Nipype-
based,
the Analysis of
Connectomes (C-PAC) v0.3.3 [https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/
tree/0.3.3_development]. After discarding the ﬁrst 4 time-points of
each functional run to allow magnetization to reach steady state, pre-
processing individual resting state functional scans consisted of 3D
motion correction (realignment using the Friston 24-parameter model
(Friston et al., 1996): 3 translational and 3 rotational parameters, their
values from the previous time-point, and the squared values of these 12
items), nuisance regression (detailed in Section 2.2.2.2), temporal
band-pass ﬁltering (0.01–0.1 Hz) except for fALFF computation, regis-
tration (detailed in Section 2.2.2.3), and spatial smoothing using a 4-
mm Gaussian kernel at full-width half maximum. The human-readable
C-PAC pipeline conﬁguration ﬁle is available online as Supplementary
Information (SI_CPACconﬁg.yml).

diﬀer signiﬁcantly pre- vs. post-intervention (t15 = 0.24, p = 0.82;
FDpre = 0.201 ± 0.09 mm, FDpost = 0.196 ± 0.09 mm).

2.2.2.2. Nuisance regression. To control for head motion eﬀects and
attenuate irrelevant signals, we used a subject-level nuisance regression
strategy involving application of CompCor (Behzadi et al., 2007) with 5
principal components derived from white matter and cerebrospinal
ﬂuid using subject-speciﬁc masks
along with regressing out
preprocessed data on the 24 Friston parameters (Friston et al., 1996)
generated from the motion correction procedure. Global signal was not
regressed out (Yan et al., 2013a, 2013b).

2.2.2.3. Image registration. To ensure robust image registration of both
sets of longitudinal scans, we adopted an unbiased pairwise approach
(Reuter et al., 2012). Using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)
algorithm for every participant, pairwise registration was performed
with the common “midway” points between the pre- and post-Cogmed
image co-
anatomical

scans. Following functional-to-anatomical

2.2.3. Resting state measures

Following data pre-processing, four resting state measures were
computed (Yang et al., 2015): amplitude of low frequency ﬂuctuations
(ALFF; Zang et al., 2007); fractional amplitude of low frequency ﬂuc-
tuations (fALFF; Zou et al., 2008); regional homogeneity (ReHo; Zang
et al., 2004), and voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC; Zuo
et al., 2010b).

For ALFF and fALFF, in subject's native space, voxel time-series were
transformed into power spectrum representations. ALFF was calculated
as the total power in the frequency range between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz,
thereby indexing the intensity of low frequency oscillations (Zang et al.,
2007). fALFF was computed as the power within the low frequency
range (0.01–0.1 Hz) divided by the total power in the entire detectable
frequency range, thus representing the relative contribution of speciﬁc
low frequency oscillations to the full range (Zou et al., 2008; Zuo et al.,
2010a). For both measures, power in subject-level maps was trans-
formed into z-scores to generate standardized subject-level maps.

ReHo was calculated for each individual subject as the Kendall's
Coeﬃcient of Concordance (KCC) between the time-series of a given
voxel and its 26 nearest neighbors (Zang et al., 2004). Values of KCC
range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating greater similarity be-
tween the time-series of a given voxel and the adjacent voxels. Subject-
level KCC maps were z-score standardized to enable group analysis.

VMHC assumes symmetric morphology between the left and right
hemispheres; therefore individual brains were ﬁrst transformed to ﬁt a
symmetric template. Functional data were then transformed to ﬁt the
new symmetrical anatomical
image. VMHC was computed as the
Pearson's correlation coeﬃcient between the time-series of a given
voxel and its symmetrical inter-hemispheric counterpart (Zuo et al.,
2010b).

These four resting state measures have been previously examined in
typically developing children and adolescents (e.g., Yang et al., 2015)
and highlight distinct properties of intrinsic brain signals. Speciﬁcally,
ALFF and fALFF quantify the amplitude of the low frequency oscilla-
tions that are a fundamental feature of intrinsic brain activity. The re-
lative magnitudes of such ﬂuctuations can serve as markers of in-
dividual diﬀerences or dysfunction. Both ALFF and fALFF show high
sensitivity to gray matter signals, although ALFF is more susceptible to
physiological noise (Zou et al., 2008; Zuo et al., 2010a).

ReHo measures local synchronization and has been associated with
individual diﬀerences in behavioral inhibition in healthy adults (Tian
et al., 2012) or resting state alterations in brain networks implicated in
attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Cao et al., 2006).

VMHC quantiﬁes the strength of inter-hemispheric synchrony in
patterns of spontaneous activity (its most robust feature) and can be
sensitive to age-related diﬀerences (Zuo et al., 2010b).

2.2.4. Statistical inference

In light of recent empirical demonstrations that parametric statis-
tical inference tends to inﬂate family-wise error rates (Eklund et al.,
2016), we opted for group-level non-parametric, permutation-based

(Winkler et al., 2014)

statistical inference. To minimize problems inherent to cluster-based
inference, e.g., spatial smoothing and cluster-forming threshold de-
pendence, we adopted the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE,
Smith and Nichols, 2009) algorithm. Permutation testing (10,000 ran-
domizations), which controls for multiple comparisons with family-
wise error rate at α = 0.05, was implemented in fsl v5.0.8's randomise
tool
[http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/
Randomise]. Due to its use of cluster-wise evidence at each voxel,
TFCE can reliably detect small, focal eﬀects that may be missed by other
methods. The algorithm's sensitivity to a wide range of signal shapes
further renders it particularly suitable for our data-driven examination
spanning diﬀerent resting state measures (ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, VMHC)
each with its unique signal properties. Paired pre- vs. post-Cogmed t-
tests included head motion (FDmean) as a nuisance covariate. Whole-
brain un-thresholded statistical maps for all four resting state measures
are freely accessible as 3D interactive images online [http://neurovault.
org/collections/ZLEIBWYV] to enable exploration of the magnitude
and spatial extent of sub-threshold eﬀects.

2.3. Cognitive measures

Six Cogstate tasks - Detection, Identiﬁcation, One-back, One Card
Learning, Continuous Paired Associate Learning and Groton Maze
Learning (Maruﬀ et al., 2009) - were administered prior to and fol-
lowing Cogmed training completion. The Cogstate standardized battery
[http://cogstate.com/computerized-tests/cognitive-tests/battery] was
chosen due to its high test-retest reliability and negligible practice ef-
fects in healthy individuals across diﬀerent exam settings (Cromer
et al., 2015; Falleti et al., 2006). Task performance (speed or accuracy
as per Maruﬀ et al., 2009) was contrasted pre- vs. post-training within
subjects using paired t-tests. Test statistics and Hedges’ gav corrected
eﬀect sizes for small, correlated samples (Lakens, 2013) for age-normed
scores are reported in Table 2. P-value adjustment for false discovery
rate at α = 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was calculated using
the p.adjust function in R version 3.0.2.

Age-normed values for the Continuous Paired Associate Learning
task were not made available by Cogstate at the time of data collection.
However, given the non-signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the Continuous Paired
Associate Learning task (pre-Cogmed accuracy = 80.8% ± 3.3 vs. post-
Cogmed accuracy = 80.0% ± 3.5), the lack of normative scores has
little impact. The central ﬁndings reported in Table 2 remained prac-
tically unchanged when analyses were replicated using raw scores for
the six Cogstate tasks (Table S1).

3. Results

Whole-brain contrasts of pre- with post-intervention maps revealed
signiﬁcant (p < 0.05, family-wise error corrected) regional diﬀerences
in two resting state measures: fALFF and ReHo (Table 3). Speciﬁcally,
we found decreased fALFF following Cogmed treatment in three clus-
ters: the largest cluster was predominantly in left cerebellum I-IV ex-
tending medially, the second largest was mostly in right cerebellum V,
and the smallest cluster was bilateral thalamus (Fig. 1). Reduced post-
treatment ReHo was observed in right superior frontal sulcus while

4. Discussion

This pilot investigation revealed preliminary evidence of Cogmed
training eﬀects on neural measures and cognitive performance in a
small sample of children with NF1. Intervention eﬀects (p < 0.05,

corrected) were found for two local resting state measures. Following
training, ReHo increased in higher order visual areas. Enhanced local
synchrony within visual cortex post-intervention can be considered in
the context of decreased BOLD activation across visual areas reported in
NF1 relative to healthy controls (Violante et al., 2012). Moreover, given
emerging evidence that visual processing deﬁcits in NF1 might be more
closely linked to poor attentional allocation rather than sensory im-
pairments (Ribeiro et al., 2014), we speculate that our short-term
training could have promoted greater synchrony within visual cortex
via top-down mechanisms (Astle et al., 2015; Constantinidis and
Klingberg, 2016).

Decreased ReHo was observed in a frontal cluster that overlaps with
frontal networks whose connectivity tends to exhibit sensitivity to
working memory training (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). In fact,
our cluster falls within 5 mm of the right caudal superior frontal sulcus
peak [34, 6, 56; MNI] identiﬁed as a hub for maintenance of visuo-
spatial
information in a meta-analysis delineating components of
working memory (Nee et al., 2013). The frontal modulation we observe
is also consistent with a recent ADHD intervention study illustrating
Cogmed training eﬀects in frontal areas near superior frontal sulcus
(Stevens et al., 2016).

The normalized resting state measure we probed in the frequency
domain, fALFF, yielded signiﬁcant intervention eﬀects in cerebellum
and thalamus. Given the U-shaped age-related trajectory of fALFF
patterns associated with working memory in healthy children and
adolescents (Yang et al., 2015), the direction of the training eﬀect in the
current study might reﬂect developmental eﬀects, although we cannot
test this speculation in our pilot sample. The cerebellar and thalamic
location of the intervention eﬀects on fALFF is intriguing considering
the white matter microstructure abnormalities in cerebellum and tha-
lamus reported in children and adolescents with NF1 relative to healthy
controls (Ferraz-Filho et al., 2012).
Behavioral improvement (false discovery rate adjustment at α =
0.05) post-intervention was found for two untrained Cogstate tasks. The
increase in Identiﬁcation task speed after Cogmed program completion
might suggest augmentation of domain-general attentional processes.
Notably, performance in the Groton Maze Learning task, which high-
lights spatial working memory demands (Pietrzak et al., 2008), was
more accurate after the Cogmed intervention. This ﬁnding suggests a
degree of generalization of training across spatial working memory.

Our preliminary results should be considered in light of limitations
beyond small sample size. First, nonspeciﬁc intervention beneﬁts
cannot be ruled out in the absence of an active control group.
Nevertheless, studies have documented Cogmed superiority over non-
adaptive contrasts (Astle et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2009). Indeed, as
expected, One-back (i.e., non-adaptive,
least challenging working
memory task) response times in our sample did not signiﬁcantly change
following Cogmed training. Second, while data quality was adequate,
and head micro-motion did not diﬀer pre- vs. post-training, motion was
in the moderate range. Accordingly, we eschewed seed-based analyses,
which are particularly susceptible to head motion artifacts (Yan et al.,
2013a, 2013b). Third, the ﬁnding of focal ReHo eﬀects, while con-
sistent with the ability of TFCE to reliably detect small clusters, should
be conﬁrmed in larger samples.

In conclusion, we provide preliminary evidence that regionally
speciﬁc changes in resting state fMRI measures may capture treatment-
related improvements of cognitive dysfunction in NF1. These pilot re-
sults should be interpreted with caution pending independent con-
trolled replication.
