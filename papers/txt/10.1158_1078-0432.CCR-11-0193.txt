Abstract

Purpose: MET signaling has been suggested a potential role in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors

(MPNST). Here, MET function and blockade were preclinically assessed.

Experimental Design: Expression levels of MET, its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and
phosphorylated MET (pMET) were examined in a clinically annotated MPNST tissue microarray (TMA)
incorporating univariable and multivariable statistical analyses. Human MPNST cells were studied in vitro
and in vivo; Western blot (WB) and ELISA were used to evaluate MET and HGF expression, activation, and
downstream signaling. Cell culture assays tested the impact of HGF-induced MET activation and anti-MET–
specific siRNA inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; in vivo gel-foam assays were used to
evaluate angiogenesis. Cells stably transduced with anti-MET short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were
tested for growth and metastasis in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The effect of the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor XL184 (Exelixis) targeting MET/VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 2) on local and metastatic MPNST growth was examined in vivo.

Results: All three markers were expressed in MPNST human samples; pMET expression was an
independent prognosticator of poor patient outcome. Human MPNST cell lines expressed MET, HGF,
and pMET. MET activation increased MPNST cell motility, invasion, angiogenesis, and induced matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and VEGF expression; MET knockdown had inverse effects in vitro and
markedly decreased local and metastatic growth in vivo. XL184 abrogated human MPNST xenograft growth
and metastasis in SCID mice.

Conclusions: Informative prognosticators and novel therapies are crucially needed to improve MPNST
management and outcomes. We show an important role for MET in MPNST, supporting continued
investigation of novel anti-MET therapies in this clinical context. Clin Cancer Res; 17(12); 3943–55. Ó2011

Statement of Translational Relevance

More effective therapies are crucially needed for the
treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNST). These highly aggressive sarcomas are notor-
ious for therapeutic resistance and are therefore fre-
quently fatal. Previous
studies have suggested a
potential role for the HGF/MET autocrine loop in
MPNST; data provided here confirm and expand these
initial insights. Activated MET expression in human
MPNST was found to be a prognosticator of shorter
disease-specific survival (DSS), and MET targeting was
shown to inhibit the migratory, invasive, and angio-
genic phenotype of MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo.
Most importantly, the orally available tyrosine kinase
inhibitor XL184 which targets MET and VEGFR2, sig-
nificantly abrogated local and metastatic growth of
human MPNST xenografts. Taken together, these data
offer new insights into MPNST molecular deregulations,
identify a novel MPNST prognostic biomarker, and
support further evaluation of anti-MET therapeutic stra-
tegies in the MPNST clinical setting.

the feasibility of developing compounds to block these
highly accessible cell surface molecules (9). TKR overex-
pression and deregulated signaling has been identified in
many malignancies, promoting tumor cell proliferation,
aberrant cell-cycle regulation, and/or activation of signal
transduction pathways mediating protumorigenic and pro-
metastatic events. One such receptor is MET, also known as
the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR). The MET
ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; also called scatter
factor), is a heparin-binding protein that is physiologically
produced by a variety of mesenchymal cells. HGF induces
pleiotropic biological activities, acting as a paracrine mito-
gen, motogen, and morphogen for epithelial cells that
express the receptor (10). HGF stimulation induces the
phosphorylation of several MET tyrosine residues (Y1003-
Y1313-Y1230/1234/1235-Y1349-Y1365), which in turn
activate multiple downstream pathways, including RAS/
ERK (extracellular signal–regulated kinase), (phosphoino-
sitide 3-kinase) PI3K/AKT, and SRC signaling (10, 11).
Combined overexpression of MET and HGF has been
reported in numerous carcinomas and sarcomas (12–
14). MET signaling deregulations because of activating
mutations, amplifications or via autocrine or paracrine
growth factor loops have been described, suggesting a
pivotal role for MET in tumorigenesis, disease progression,
and metastasis (15–17); cancer-associated MET activation
has been shown to trigger cell growth, survival, invasion,
and angiogenesis (10, 18). These initial observations have
prompted development of small molecule MET inhibitors.
Such compounds have showed efficacy in preclinical stu-
dies in vitro and in vivo; several are currently being evaluated
in human cancer clinical trials (19–21).

Several lines of evidence support a potential role for
HGF/MET signaling in MPNST: (i) HGF has been found to
be a mitogen for rat Schwann cells which normally express

MET but not HGF (22); (ii) MET and HGF gene amplifica-
tions have been observed in human MPNST as per tumor
specimen screening (23); (iii) HGF and MET proteins are
concomitantly expressed in human MPNST samples (14);
and (iv) anti-HGF antibody was found to inhibit MET
activation in the ST88 MPNST cell
line resulting in
decreased invasive phenotype (24). Although limited by
small numbers of testable specimens and cell lines, these
initial insights strongly support further investigation of
MET as a potential MPNST biomarker and therapeutic
target.

Materials and Methods

Cell lines and reagents
Human MPNST cell

lines ST88-14, STS26T, and
MPNST724 were maintained and propagated as previously
described (25); primary cultured normal human Schwann
cells (NSC) served as controls. Additional cell line–related
information including source and other cells used as con-
trols is described in Supplementary Data. Authentication of
cell lines was conducted utilizing Short Tandem Repeat
DNA fingerprinting (STR; Supplementary Data and
Table S1). The cytokines HGF and VEGF were purchased
from R&D and the MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor, XL184 was
kindly provided by Exelixis. Commercially available anti-
bodies were used for immunoblot or immunohistochem-
ical (IHC) detection of: MET, phosphorylated (pMET;
Tyr1234/Tyr1235 and Tyr1349), AKT, pAKT (Ser473),
ERK, pERK, RET, VEGF, VEGFR2, pVEGFR2, AXL, KIT (Cell
Signaling), HGF, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2; R&D
Systems), CD31, (Pharmingen), goat anti-rat HRP (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), DeadEnd Fluoro-
metric TUNEL System (Promega), Ki67 (Thermo/Lab
Vision), and b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Clinically annotated tissue microarray

A recently established tissue microarray (TMA)-contain-
ing tissues retrieved from 96 MPNST surgical specimens
(NF1 associated ¼ 55, sporadic ¼ 41) was used (3). This
TMA also includes 4 evaluable samples of normal nerves
(brachial, sciatic, supraclavicular, and cervical) which were
evaluated as controls. A comprehensive clinical database
containing patient, tumor, treatment, and follow-up infor-
mation linked to TMA has previously constructed and has
been updated to enable current analysis.

Immunohistochemistry

TMA immunostaining and xenograft derived specimens
immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining were conducted as we have previously described
(3, 26). For TMA analysis, each biomarker was scored by 2
independent observers (G.L. and A.L.) after excluding spots
with insufficient tumor tissue or those that detached from
the slide as sometimes occurs on TMAs as the result of the
IHC process. Intensity was graded as none (¼ 0), weak/low
(¼ 1), or moderate-to-strong/high (¼ 2 to 3), and the

percentage of positive tumor cells was estimated. Similarly,
staining distribution (% positive-stained tumor cells) and
intensity (0 ¼ no staining, 1 ¼ low, 2 ¼ high) as well as
CD31 counts (in 10 HPF) of xenograft tissues were
evaluated and scored by 2 independent reviewers (K.T.
and E.Y.).

Cellular assays

More detailed information is available as Supplementary
Data. In brief; MTS and clonogenicity assays were con-
ducted as previously described (26). Western blot (WB)
analyses were carried out by standard methods (26).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) HGF and
VEGF levels were measured in MPNST cell conditioned
media (CM) using ELISA. The assays were constructed and
preformed following manufacturer’s instructions (R&D).
Migration and invasion assays were conducted using mod-
ified Boyden chambers as previously described (27). Quan-
titative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for MMP2 was conducted
as previously described (28). MET gene sequencing proce-
dure and primers, as well as siRNA and short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) transfection and transduction procedures are
detailed in Supplementary Data.

In vivo animal experiments

All animal procedures/care was approved by UTMDACC
Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. Animals
received humane care as per the Animal Welfare Act and the
NIH "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals".
In vivo Gelfoam angiogenesis assay and animal models
were utilized as previously described (29, 30). Information
regarding animal models and therapeutic schemas are
provided in Supplementary Data.

Statistics

A Spearman’s test was used to test correlation between
HGF and pMET expression in human MPNST specimens
and cell lines. To evaluate the correlation of TMA biomar-
ker expression and patient disease-specific survival (DSS;
defined as the time interval from the date of presentation to
MD Anderson to the date when the patient dies of MPNST
or to the last follow-up date, whichever occurred first), each
independent variable was first examined separately in a
univariable Cox proportional hazards model. All univari-
able Cox models were fitted with all possible data points.
For all outcomes, only the independent variables that had P
values of 0.10 or less in the univariable Cox model analyses
were examined in multivariable Cox models; P  0.05 was
set as the cutoff. Cell culture–based assays were repeated at
least twice; the means and SD were calculated for each
assay. Cell lines were examined separately. For outcomes
that were measured at a single time point, 2 sample t tests
were used to assess the differences. A mixed effect model
was used to assess differences in xenograft growth over time
between treatment and control groups. Differences in
xenograft size and weight (tumor/metastases) between
treatment and control groups at study termination were
assessed using a 2-tailed Student’s t test. Significance was set

at P  0.05. All computations were conducted in SAS 9.1
(SAS Institute) and Splus 7.0 (Insightful Corporation).

Results

HGF and MET are highly expressed in human MPNST
samples: pMET expression levels correlate with
shorter MPNST-specific survival

We have recently reported the overexpression of several
TKRs, including MET, in MPNST utilizing our TMA (31).
Here, we aimed to further examine the expression of HGF
and activated MET (pMET; Fig. 1A); all MPNST samples on
the TMA were evaluated when available. All MPNSTs
expressed MET: low levels were observed in 9% (n ¼ 9)
and moderate-to-high in 91% (n ¼ 87), an average of 92%
(8%) of tumor cells per sample exhibited positive MET
staining. Similarly, all (100%) of MPNSTs expressed HGF:
low levels were found in 43% (n ¼ 39) and intermediate to
high expression levels were noticed in 57% (n ¼ 51) of
cases, an average of 60% (24%) of tumor cells per sample
exhibited positive HGF staining. pMET expression was
found in 51% (n ¼ 45) of MPNSTs, no pMET expression
could be found in the remainder of samples; pMET staining
(in samples that expressed pMET) was exhibited on average
in approximately 30% (20%) of tumor cells. A strong
correlation between pMET and HGF expression was iden-
tified (correlation coefficient: 0.45, P ¼ 0.003; Spearman’s
test). It is of note, however, that not all specimens expres-
sing both MET and HGF exhibited activated MET. It is
known that HGF is secreted as an inactive zymogen that is
further activated by protease cleavage (32). To that end
HGF/MET autocrine loop can only be functional when
these HGF activators are also present possibly explaining
the above described scenario. This association has pre-
viously been reported in MPNST (24). Interestingly, meta-
static MPNST lesions (n ¼ 15) expressed higher pMET
intensity (average 1  0.67 vs. 0.44  0.58) and distribu-
tion (22%  24% vs. 11%  17%) as compared with
localized (primary and recurrent) lesions (n ¼ 55). No
difference in expression of any marker could be showed
when comparing NF1-associated with sporadic MPNST. Of
note, MET expression was found in all 4 normal nerve
sheath samples (low intensity ¼ 2, moderate intensity ¼ 2)
but only minimal HGF (none to very weak) was seen and
no pMET was observed in these samples (Fig. 1A).

Next, we evaluated whether marker expression intensity
and distribution correlated with DSS of patients with
localized MPNST (n ¼ 55). A univariable analysis failed
to identify HGF and MET expression levels as predictive of
shorter patient survival (Supplementary Table S2). In con-
trast, and of potential major clinical importance, high
pMET expression levels and increased percentage of posi-
tive cells were found to be prognosticators of unfavorable
DSS (P ¼ 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively). pMET expression
was also found to be an independent prognosticator (P ¼
0.014) based on a multivariable analysis which included
factors previously shown to have independent prognostic
value [i.e., p53 expression, tumor size  10 cm, and loss of

S100 protein expression (3)]. Interestingly, tumor size and
decreased S100 expression lost their independent status
with the inclusion of pMET in this analysis. These findings
strongly support the potential clinical applicability of stu-
dies focusing on the MET pathway in the context of
MPNST.

HGF, MET, and constitutively activated MET are highly
expressed in human MPNST cell lines

Next, we evaluated whether human MPNST cell lines
express MET and thus can be used to further evaluate the
potential function of this receptor in MPNST (Fig. 1B). WB
analysis showed increased MET expression in ST88 and
STS26T MPNST cell lines compared with NSC; MPNST724
cells did express MET, albeit at comparatively lower levels.
Most importantly, constitutive phosphorylation of MET to
varying degrees was found in all MPNST cells but not in
NSC. No direct correlation between total MET and pMET
expression could be found; that is, STS26T cells, (highly
MET expressive), exhibited the lowest pMET levels, whereas
MPNST724 exhibited lower MET levels yet expressed a
relatively high level of pMET. MET activating mutations
have been described for various human tumors (15, 17, 33,
34). To address whether the observed activation of MET in
MPNST cells could be secondary to such mutations, we
sequenced the MET gene: no mutations in the IPT repeat
(exon 10), the juxtamembrane (exons 13–15), and the
kinase (exons 16–19) could be found.

To further determine whether MET activation is second-
ary to an HGF autocrine loop, we evaluated the expression
of cell-secreted HGF (Fig. 1C): MPNST cells were found to
express high levels of HGF as compared with either NSC

(exhibiting no HGF expression) or 2 other soft tissue
sarcoma cell lines serving as controls. These findings taken
together suggest that HGF and MET may possibly form an
autocrine signaling loop in human MPNST cells.

MET activation enhances MPNST migratory, invasive,
and angiogenic phenotypes

Next, we evaluated whether HGF can induce further MET
phosphorylation in MPNST cells and also determined the
functional consequences of MET activation. Figure 2A
shows that HGF stimulation (50 ng/mL for 20 minutes)
results in increased pMET (Tyr1234/1235) expression in
serum-starved MPNST cells; in turn leading to downstream
activation of the PI3 kinase and the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Of note, pMET levels
were found to be generally lower when MPNST cells were
cultured in serum-free media as compared with serum-
containing conditions; no decrease in HGF levels was
found under these culture conditions (data not shown),
suggesting that other mechanisms are possibly responsible
for this observed pMET decrease. No significant effect on
MPNST growth was detected secondary to HGF stimulation
as evaluated by MTS (24 and 48 hours) and clonogenicity
(10 days) assays (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). However,
a significant increase in cell migration and invasion, 2
cellular functions critical for local aggressiveness and dis-
tant metastasis was noticed using modified Boyden cham-
ber assays (12 hours; Fig. 2B). NSC do express MET, but
unlike MPNST cells these normal cells do not exhibit
constitutive MET phosphorylation and do not secret high
levels of the ligand HGF (Fig. 1B and C). On HGF stimula-
tion (at same doses as for MPNST cells) increase in MET

Figure 2. MET activation enhances MPNST cell migratory, invasive, and angiogenic phenotype. A, WB depicting enhanced MET phosphorylation and
downstream signaling (through AKT and ERK) in response to HGF. Cells were grown in serum-free media overnight prior to HGF stimulation. B, enhanced
MPNST migration and invasion in response to HGF stimulation was identified using modified Boyden chamber assays; C, MPNST cell collected CM ( i.e.
MPNST cells were stimulated with HGF (or no HGF) for 24 hours, after careful washing, fresh serum-free media was added and collected after 24 hours)
enhanced the growth of HDMECs (MTS assays, STS26T cells are shown; upper left graph). Similarly, MPNST cell collected CM, especially from cells
prestimulated with HGF increased HDMEC migration and invasion (right panel). Lastly, an in vivo gel foam assay showed that HGF-stimulated MPNST cell
CM significantly enhances angiogenesis (evaluated via CD31 immunofluorescence), D, HGF stimulation enhances MMP2 mRNA expression (qRT-PCR)
and VEGF protein expression (ELISA) in MPNST cells. [Graphs represent the average of at least 2 repeated experiments  SD; *, denotes statistically

phosphorylation was observed (Supplementary Fig. S2A);
no significant effect on proliferation was seen (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2B) but increase in migration and invasion was
noted (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data show that
HGF is a NSC motogen, and it is possible that, as com-
monly occurs in cancer, MPNST cells "hijack" this physio-
logic function and by simultaneously expressing both the
receptor and the ligand acquire an aggressive phenotype.
MPNST growth and dissemination, analogous to other
solid malignancies, depends on cross-talk between tumor
and tumor-associated normal cells. MPNSTs are generally
highly vascular and angiogenic,
facilitating metastatic
potential. Consequently, we sought to evaluate whether
MET activation enhanced the pro-angiogenic capacity of
MPNST cells. Toward that end, serum starved MPNST cells
were treated with HGF for 24 hours or with no HGF
(control). Fresh media was added to the cells after repeated
washings (i.e., no exogenous HGF present) and was col-
lected after 24 hours. Incubation of human dermal micro-
vessel endothelial cells (HDMEC) with CM collected from
cells pretreated with HGF enhanced the proliferation and,
most significantly, the migration and invasion of these
endothelial cells, as compared with incubation with CM
collected from MPNST cells not treated with HGF or
HDMECs cultured in serum-free media alone (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, an increased number of CD31 positive blood
vessels were found in gel foams resuspended in HGF-
pretreated MPNST CM, an assay of in vivo angiogenesis
(Fig. 2C).

Our data suggest that HGF-induced MET activation
enhances the migratory, invasive, and angiogenic pheno-
type of MPNST cells. Of potential importance, we found
that MET activation induces MMP2 mRNA expression
(qRT-PCR) and VEGF protein secretion (ELISA) by MPNST
cells (Fig. 2D). These factors are known to contribute to
migration, invasion, and/or angiogenesis and their induc-
tion may, at least in part, underlie the functional effects
noted above.

MET knockdown induces anti-MPNST effects in vitro
and in vivo

Next, we knocked down MET in MPNST cells using anti-
MET–specific siRNA (20 nmol/L pool); nontargeting
siRNA (a pool of 4 nontargeting constructs) was used as
control. A significant decrease (40% and 75% in
STS26T and MPNST724, respectively) in total MET protein
expression was achieved after this knockdown (Fig. 3A;
densitometry data depicted in Fig S3). Most importantly,
MET knockdown blocked ligand-induced activation of
MET and resultant downstream signaling. MET knockdown
did not affect cell growth and proliferation (data not
shown) but significantly inhibited constitutive and HGF-
induced cell migration and invasion (Fig. 3B). These data
confirm the observations described above and further
support an important role for MET in the MPNST migratory
and invasive phenotype.

Most importantly, we sought to evaluate if MET func-
tional effects were operative in vivo. To achieve stable MET

knockdown in MPNST cells, we first screened several
shMET constructs to determine their knockdown efficiency
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Constructs 1 and 4 were found
to significantly inhibit MET expression and were subse-
quently used for stable lentiviral shRNAs transduction; a
nontargeting shRNA was used as control. Stable MET
knockdown blocked HGF-induced MET phosphorylation
and downstream signaling (Fig. 3C). As with transient MET
knockdown, no significant effect on tumor cell growth was
seen (Supplementary Fig. S1D); however, a marked reduc-
tion in constitutive and HGF-regulated migration and
invasion was found (Fig. 3D). MET knockdown blocked
HGF-mediated induction of MMP2 and VEGF expression
(Fig. 3D).

Next, the growth of MET shRNA (constructs 1 and 4)
STS26T-transduced cells was evaluated in vivo; nontargeting
shRNA-transduced cells were used as controls. As depicted
in Figure 4A, MET knockdown xenografts showed slower
growth (P < 0.001) and a significantly decreased volume at
study termination as compared with control tumors (0.10
 0.01 g and 0.10  0.01 g vs. 0.52  0.2 g; P < 0.001). IHC
studies confirmed decreased MET expression in tumors
originating from METshRNA-transduced cells (Fig. 4B).
MET-knocked down tumors exhibited decreased microves-
sel density (measured by CD31 staining), increased apop-
tosis (measured via TUNEL), decreased proliferation
(measured by Ki67), and decreased MMP2 and VEGF
expression. As no effect on proliferation of MPNST cells
was noted in vitro after MET blockade, it is possible that the
marked differences observed in xenografts growth are sec-
ondary to the antiangiogenic effects elicited by of MET
knockdown.

Finally, we evaluated the impact of MET knockdown on
MPNST metastasis growth utilizing an experimental lung
metastasis approach. All 5 NTshRNA intravenously injected
mice exhibited extensive lung metastases; no macroscopic
metastases were found in 3 of the METshRNA1 mice and
only isolated metastases (3) were found in the additional
2 mice. A similar metastatic pattern was
seen in
METshRNA4-injected mice. Average lung weight of
NTshRNA-injected mice was 0.88  0.36 g compared with
0.34  0.21 g and 0.37  0.17 g in MET1shRNA and
MET4shRNA intravenously injected mice,
respectively
(Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data suggest that MET
contributes to local and metastatic MPNST growth and
tumor-associated angiogenesis.

The multi-kinase MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor, XL184,
exerts marked anti-MPNST effects in vitro and in vivo
Seeking to further show a potential role for MET in
MPNST, we evaluated the impact of the small molecule
multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor XL184 (targeting MET and
VEGFR2; Exelixis) on MPNST growth. Marked inhibition of
constitutive and inducible MET phosphorylation and its
resultant downstream signaling was observed in all MPNST
cells tested after 4-hour incubation with XL184 at doses
as low as 0.1 to 0.5mmol/L (Fig. 5A and S4A). No
VEGFR2 expression could be identified in MPNST cells

Figure 3. MET knockdown inhibits MPNST cell migration and invasion. A, anti-MET siRNA (siMET; 20 nmol/L pool) knockdown (KD) resulted in a
significant decrease in MET expression and blocked HGF-induced MET activation and downstream signaling in MPNST cells. Nontargeting siRNA construct
transfection was used as control (relative protein expression levels per densitometry are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S3); B, MET KD inhibited both
constitutive and HGF-induced MPNST cell migration and invasion. C, STS26T (shown) and MPNST724 cells were stably transduced with 2 different
shMET (shMET1 and shMET4) constructs that were found to markedly inhibit MET expression; NT shRNA construct was used as control (shNT). KD inhibited
MET phosphorylation and downstream signaling. D, as with siRNA, stable shMET significantly blocked MPNST cell migration and invasion (results of
STS26T cells are shown). MET KD blocked HGF-induced MMP2 mRNA (qRT-PCR) and VEGF protein (ELISA) expression. [*, denotes statistically
significant effects (P<0.05)]

(Supplementary Fig. S4B), thus inhibitory activity of XL184
on VEGFR2 is possibly more relevant in an in vivo setting,
blocking the activity of this receptor on tumor-associated
endothelial cells. XL184 does induce marked inhibition of

MET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in cytokine-stimulated
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs ; Fig. 5A).
Only minimal impact on growth was seen with low
XL184 doses (0.1mmol/L for 48 hours) although MET

Figure 4. MET knockdown inhibits
MPNST local and metastatic
growth in vivo. A, ShMET-
transduced STS26T cells were
evaluated for local growth in SCID
mice. MET KD xenografts
exhibited slower growth (left
graph; P < 0.001), decreased size
at study termination (middle panel;
P < 0.001), and a significantly
decreased weight (right graph;
P < 0.001) at study termination as
compared with control shNT
xenografts. B. IHC staining
confirmed decreased MET
expression in tumors originating
from METshRNA-transduced
cells. MET KD tumors exhibited
decreased microvessel density
(measured by CD31 staining),
increased apoptosis (measured
via TUNEL), decreased
proliferation (measured by Ki67,
control magnification is 200,
shMET1 and shMET4
magnification is 40, reflecting a
larger field of cells), and decreased
MMP2 and VEGF expression. C,
average lung weight of NT shRNA
tail vein injected mice was
markedly higher than that of MET
KD cells injected mice reflecting a
significantly decreased metastatic
load. [*, denotes statistically
significant effects (P < 0.05)]

inhibition at this dose was evident (Fig. 5B). However,
increased XL184 doses did elicit a significant MPNST cell
growth inhibition; higher XL184 doses were needed to
inhibit NSC growth (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Although,
the MET and VEGFR2 might be the most MPNST-relevant
targets in this experimental setting, additional biologically
relevant effects might be exerted through inhibition of
other cancer-specific XL184 targets such as AXL, RET,
and KIT (35). MPNST cells were found to express varying
levels of these receptors (Supplementary Fig. S4B) possibly
explaining the observed decrease in cell growth with
increasing XL184 doses. Next, we evaluated whether
XL184 (0.5 mmol/L) could inhibit MPNST cell migration
and invasion. Cells were pretreated with XL184 for 4 hours
and plated without the inhibitor in modified Boyden
chambers. As depicted in Fig. 5C, XL184 treatment blocked
HGF-induced MPNST motility and invasion (a similar
effect of found on NSC [Supplementary Fig. S2C]). Lastly,
we evaluated the effect of XL184 on MPNST cytokine rich
CM induced angiogenesis. An in vivo gel foam assay was
conducted as per above and mice were treated with XL184
(30 mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days. A significant decrease in
microvessel density was observed (Fig. 5D). Taken
together,
the potential
anti-tumor and, most importantly, anti-metastatic effects
of XL184 in MPNST.

these findings possibly reflect

To determine whether the in vitro observations could be
recapitulated in vivo, we conducted a series of therapeutic
experiments using xenograft severe combined immunode-
ficient (SCID) mice models. A XL184 dose of 30 mg/kg/day
given orally was selected based on the previous observation
that this therapeutic dose results in greater than 90%
tumoral pMET inhibition in vivo (as compared with
50% when a dose of 10 mg/kg is administered; (36).
The difference in XL184 potency between cells in culture
and tissue in mice (PK experiments show Cmax values of
13.7 mmol/L in nude mice plasma at the dose above;
personal communication) is protein binding, which is
greater than 99% in plasma. To that end, the dose selected
for mice experiments is likely biologically comparable with
that used in cell culture experiments.

First, we investigated the effect of XL184 on STS26T
growth (Fig. 6A); therapy was initiated after tumor estab-
lishment (5 mm in larger dimension). This treatment
regimen was highly tolerated; no significant weight loss was
observed. XL184-treated tumors exhibited a significantly
slower growth (P < 0.001). Moreover, treatment with
XL184 significantly reduced tumor size (P < 0.001) and
weight compared with control (P ¼ 0.008); average tumor
weights at study termination were 0.84 g (SD  0.5) and
0.11 g (SD  0.06) in control and XL184 groups, respec-
tively. To even more closely mimic a clinically relevant

scenario, the above experiment was repeated but treatment
was initiated later when tumors reached a larger size (7–9
mm in largest dimension; Fig. 6A). XL184 significantly
halted tumor growth (P < 0.001) and reduced tumor weight
(P ¼ 0.002) compared with control; average tumor weights
at study termination were 0.98 g (SD  0.3) and 0.27 g (SD
 0.16) in control and XL184 groups, respectively.

Finally, to confirm that XL184 anti-MPNST effects were
specific, we also utilized the

not STS26T xenograft

MPNST724 model to assess therapeutic effects, demon-
strating significant antitumor effects of XL184 treatment in
this model as well (P < 0.001; Fig. 6B). At the time point
mandating control mouse euthanasia, average volumes of
vehicle-treated tumors were 1,609 mL  493 as compared
with 17 mL  12 of the XL184-treated tumors (P < 0.001).
XL184 treatment was continued for an additional 12 days
with no evidence of tumor regrowth. Comparing the effects

XL184

Figure 6. XL184 abrogates local and metastatic MPNST growth in vivo. A, SCID mice bearing STS26T xenografts (5mm in average larger dimension)
were treated with XL184 (n ¼ 8 mice; 30 mg/kg) or vehicle only (n ¼ 7 mice). XL184 markedly abrogated tumor growth (P < 0.001; left top graph).
Moreover, treatment with XL184 significantly reduced tumor weight compared with control (P ¼ 0.008; right top graph). Experiment was repeated but
treatment was initiated later when STS26T xenografts reached a larger size (7 to 9mm in largest dimension). XL184 significantly halted tumor growth (n ¼ 9
mice; bottom left graph) as compared with control (n ¼ 9 mice; P < 0.001) and reduced tumor weight (P ¼ 0.002; bottom right graph); B. similarly, a
significant anti-tumor effect was found with XL184 treatment of MPNST724 xenografts (n ¼ 10 mice in each arm XL184 vs control). XL184 was continued for
12 days after control mice euthanasia with no evidence of tumor regrowth. C, based on IHC analysis, XL184 treatment inhibited MET phosphorylation
without demonstrable impact on total MET expression levels. Furthermore, a pronounced decrease in number of tumor-associated blood vessels (showed
by CD31 positivity), a marked decrease in MPNST cell proliferation (Ki67 staining), and a demonstrable increase in tumor cell apoptosis (TUNEL positivity)
was observed in XL184-treated tumors. D, STS26T lung metastases bearing mice were treated with XL184 (n ¼ 8 mice). At study termination, lungs of control
mice (n ¼ 8 mice) were almost completely replaced by tumor (left panel) whereas only isolated lesions were found in 2 mice of the XL184-treated group.
Macroscopic findings were also confirmed on HþE staining, demonstrating large lung tumor deposits in control and only small or no microscopic lesions in
XL184 groups. A significant difference in average lung weight was found between control and XL184-treated mice (P ¼ 0.002; right panel). [*, denotes

pronounced antitumor effect was noted in the latter where
tumor regression was observed; in STS26T tumors, XL184
induced a marked and statistically significant decrease in
growth rate but not tumor abrogation. Future studies to
identify additional therapies that can be used in combina-
tion with XL184 to further enhance cytotoxicity might be
warranted.

Tumor sections containing viable cells from each experi-
mental arm were selected for IHC studies. To first confirm
that XL184 blocked MET phosphorylation in vivo, immu-
nostaining for pMET was carried out. Figure 6C shows the
marked inhibition of MET activation in the XL184-treated
group without comparable impact on total MET expression
levels. Furthermore, a pronounced decrease in number of
tumor-associated blood vessels was observed (showed by
CD31 positivity), confirming the antiangiogenic, antivas-
cular effects of XL184. XL184 treatment resulted in marked
decrease in MPNST cell proliferation, and a demonstrable
increase in tumor cell apoptosis.

Finally, to evaluate whether XL184 resulted in pulmon-
ary metastastic outgrowth inhibition, we utilized the
STS26T experimental MPNST lung metastasis model. Treat-
ment was initiated a week after tail vein injection (lung
metastases can usually be found at this time), mice were
followed and then sacrificed after 3 weeks. Lungs of control
mice (n ¼ 8) were almost completely replaced by tumor
(Fig. 6D). In contrast, isolated lung metastases could be
found in only 2 of the XL184 and no macroscopic disease
was visualized in 6 additional mice. Macroscopic findings
were also confirmed on hematoxylin and eosin (HþE)
staining, demonstrating large lung tumor deposits in con-
trol and only small or no microscopic lesions in XL184
groups. A significant difference in average lung weight was
found between control (0.46  0.11 g) and treated mice
(0.23  0.04 g; P ¼ 0.002). Taken together, these results
suggest that XL184 inhibits the growth of MPNST lung
metastases.

Discussion

Knowledge of

the molecular mechanisms driving
MPNST development and progression is currently fragmen-
tary. The loss of neurofibromin, the protein product of the
NF1 gene, is the molecular hallmark of NF1 and is sug-
gested to be the primary tumor initiating event; NF1 loss
has also been documented in sporadic MPNST (37, 38).
However, additional genetic and epigenetic deregulations
are required for malignant progression and acquisition of a
metastatic phenotype. Alterations in major tumor-asso-
ciated nodes/pathways such as p53, RB1, p16, p14, and
p27 have been identified to occur exclusively in MPNSTs as
compared with their benign neurofibroma counterparts
(39, 40). Establishing MPNST-associated molecular aberra-
tions amenable to therapeutic manipulation is a major
investigational priority. To achieve that end, and justified
by previously published data (14, 22, 24), the current study
focused on the potential role of the MET-signaling pathway
in MPNST. MET and its ligand HGF were found to be highly

XL184 Inhibits MPNST Growth and Metastasis

expressed in a relatively large panel of human MPNST
samples. Furthermore, increased pMET expression levels
were found to directly correlate with shorter MPNST
patient survival. These observations are of potential major
clinical relevance as sensitive MPNST-related molecular
prognosticators could offer a heretofore lacking valuable
tool to positively impact on patient surveillance and man-
agement. MET expression and activation have been asso-
ciated with prognosis in a number of other tumor types
(41, 42) and, most importantly, have been found to predict
response to MET inhibitors (43).

Aberrant MET signaling in cancer has demonstrably
broad protumorigenic, prometastatic functional effects
(10). Among diverse effects, enhanced tumor cell prolif-
eration and survival has been shown to commonly occur,
possibly as a result of ERK and AKT pathways activation
(11). Concordantly, HGF has previously been shown to be
a Schwann cell (the proposed MPNST cell of origin) mito-
gen, significantly enhancing the proliferation of these cells
(22). Interestingly, our investigations, consistent with a
previously published study (24), failed to show a mito-
genic, proproliferative effect of HGF/MET signaling in
MPNST. In contrast, a significant impact on the migratory,
invasive, and angiogenic phenotype of MPNST cells was
observed in vitro and in vivo. These latter tumor-associated
properties are essential for local aggressiveness and metas-
tasis (10). The impact of HGF/MET on migration and
invasion has previously been described and various mole-
cular mechanisms underlying these capacities have been
proposed. Our studies have identified HGF-induced MMP2
expression in MPNST cells as a possible mechanism for the
observed enhanced tumor cell invasion. HGF is a known
independent angiogenic factor mediating endothelial cell
proliferation, survival, and motility through direct activa-
tion of MET expressed on these cells as well as through
cooperation with VEGFR2 (44). Our data support an
indirect proangiogenic effect of HGF/MET through the
regulation of angiogenic factor expression by MPNST cells
and tumor:endothelial cell cross-talk. Similarly, HGF-
induced increases in the production of angiogenic cyto-
kines IL-8 and VEGF by head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma cell lines has previously been described (18).
Taken together, our findings show a role for the HGF/MET
autocrine loop in MPNST progression and metastatic
spread.

Increasing knowledge of cancer-related deregulations
undergirds the intensive efforts to develop drugs that
eliminate tumor cells while sparing normal tissues. This
target-orientated approach is aimed specifically at mole-
cules that are involved in and contributing to cancer
initiation and progression and are also easily "drugable."
However, the vast majority of cancers defy single-mole-
cule–directed therapy (45). Even malignancies which
initially respond to such treatments usually develop resis-
tance, and the tumors that emerge are often more aggres-
sive and difficult
to treat (45). These disappointing
outcomes most probably reflect the extraordinary hetero-
geneity and complexity of cancer, involving numerous

molecular deregulations, genetic instability, and aneu-
ploidy. In light of this complex reality, new agents or
therapeutic combinations with broader specificity are
being pursued in the hope that they will disable multiple
nodes of vulnerability and simultaneously inhibit differ-
ent procancer mechanisms. Our current study highlights
the potential utility of MET as a potential MPNST ther-
apeutic target potentially relevant to preventing or at least
decreasing tumor recurrence and/or metastatic spread. As
per the contemporary paradigm described above, we have
elected to evaluate the preclinical effect of a novel com-
pound, XL184, an ATP competitive and orally active
inhibitor known to target MET and also other TKRs,
specifically the angiogenic receptor VEGFR2 and the
RET, KIT, FLT3, TIE2, and AXL receptors (35). Analogous
to other solid malignancies, MPNSTs consist of both
tumor cells and tumor-associated normal cells; the latter
are potentially more susceptible to therapeutic targeting
because of their relative genetic stability. MPNSTs are
generally highly vascular and angiogenic; tumor:endothe-
lial cell cross-talk results in increased metastatic potential
(46). As reflected in our studies, targeting both tumor
cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells using XL184
induces significant decrease in local and metastatic
MPNST growth in vivo. XL184 has previously shown
significant anticancer effects in preclinical models of
brain, breast,
lung, pancreatic, and thyroid cancers
(35). Furthermore, the drug has been shown to reverse
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition resis-
tance in lung cancer cells (47). An initial phase I clinical
trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies showed
XL184 to be well tolerated; generally only low-to-mod-
erate severity side effects have been identified. Several
