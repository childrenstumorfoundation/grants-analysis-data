Abstract

Background—Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that predisposes affected 
individuals to formation of benign neurofibromas, peripheral nerve tumors that can be associated 
with significant morbidity. Loss of the NF1 Ras-GAP protein causes increased Ras-GTP, and we 
previously found that inhibiting MEK signaling downstream of Ras can shrink established 
neurofibromas in a genetically engineered murine model.

Procedures—We studied effects of MEK inhibition using 1.5 mg/kg/day PD-0325901 prior to 
neurofibroma onset in the Nf1 flox/flox;Dhh-Cre mouse model. We also treated mice with 
established tumors at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/day dosees of PD-0325901. We monitored tumor volumes 
using MRI and volumetric measurements, and measured pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
endpoints.

Results—Early administration significantly delayed neurofibroma development as compared to 
vehicle controls. When treatment was discontinued neurofibromas grew, but no rebound effect 
was observed and neurofibromas remained significantly smaller than controls. Low dose treatment 
of mice with PD-0325901 resulted in neurofibroma shrinkage equivalent to that observed at higher 
doses. Tumor cell proliferation decreased, although less than at higher doses with drug. Tumor 
blood vessels per area correlated with tumor shrinkage.

Conclusions—Neurofibroma development was not prevented by MEK inhibition, beginning at 
1 month of age, but tumor size was controlled by early treatment. Moreover, treatment with 
PD-0325901 at very low doses may shrink neurofibromas while minimizing toxicity. These 
studies highlight how genetically engineered mouse models can guide clinical trial design.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant single-gene 
disorders affecting neurological function in humans, as NF1 mutations are found in about 1 
of 3,500 births (1). About 50% of individuals with NF1 inherit disease through the germ 
line, while in others the disease is a result of spontaneous mutations (2, 3). NF1 is caused by 
germ line mutations in NF1, a gene that inactivates the RAS pathway (4). NF1 disease is 
clinically characterized by the presence of benign peripheral nerve tumors, called 
neurofibromas, containing Schwann cells with biallelic mutations in the NF1 gene (5), as 
well as other tumor and non-tumor manifestations (6, 7).

Approximately 25–30% of children with NF1 develop benign plexiform neurofibromas 
(PNFs) associated with large nerve trunks, which can cause significant morbidity when they 
compress vital structures (8). Plexiform neurofibromas can undergo malignant 
transfprmation into MPNST (9). Currently, there is no therapy available to shrink or to 
prevent growth of neurofibromas, other than surgical dissection. However, surgery is rarely 
curative and often impossible because neurofibromas are part of peripheral nerves, and thus 
many neurofibromas are inoperable. In addition, recurrence rates of resected neurofibromas 
are high and repeated surgery can be required. Classic chemotherapy and radiation do not 
slow neurofibroma growth. Clinical trials are therefore ongoing in an attempt to find 
effective remedies using targeted therapeutics. Recent clinical trials used volumetric MRI 
analysis to evaluate response and progression (10) as standard response criteria for 
malignant solid tumors is not applicable for the slow growing and complex shaped 
plexiform neurofibromas. Response is defined as a ≥20% decrease in tumor volume 
compared to baseline, and progression is defined as a ≥20% increase in tumor volume 
compared to baseline. Minor plexiform neurofibroma shrinkage in a subset of patients has 
been observed in clinical trials with pegintron (11) and imatinib (12) and some delay in time 
to progression with sirolimus (13).

Pre-clinical trials using mouse models may expedite identification of the most promising 
agents to test in human clinical trials. Based on this rationale, we and others have developed 
mouse neurofibroma models for preclinical testing (14, 15). In Nf1 mouse models, including 
the Nf flox/flox;DhhCre mouse model, all mice form neurofibromas which are histologically 
identical to human neurofibromas. Thus, neurofibromas are comprised of Schwann cells, 
axons, fibroblasts, perineurial cells, mast cells, macrophages and blood vessels (16–18). 
Mouse tumors can, like human neurofibromas, be monitored using volumetric measurement 
after MRI imaging (14, 19).

Because the NF1 protein encodes a Ras-GAP protein, NF1 loss results in high Ras-GTP (20, 
21). Therefore, NF1 research has focused intensively on testing inhibitors in the Ras 
signaling pathway, including the Ras-MAPK cascade. PD-0325901 is a potent allosteric 
inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 that is currently in clinical cancer trials (22–24). Of 70 tested 
kinases, PD-0325901 blocked MEK1, with the related MEK5 affected at 10-fold higher 
concentrations; no other kinases were affected (25). PD-0325901 is specific because it is an 
allosteric, not a kinase active site, inhibitor. Preliminary studies reported adverse effects 
after prolonged treatment of patients with advanced cancers with ≥10 mg twice daily 
PD-0325901 (22, 23, 26); the current clinical dose is 8 mg twice daily in humans, equivalent 
to 1.5 mg/kg daily in mice. In the Nf flox/flox; DhhCre mouse model, PD-0325901 at 1.5, 5, 
and 10 mg/kg/day shrank neurofibromas in >80% of treated mice as monitored using 
volumetric measurements (27). At present, there are two ongoing clinical trials of MEK 
inhibitors to treat neurofibromas, and a third trial close to opening. (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01362803) and NCT0296471 (PD); NCT02124772 (GSK 
116540; Trametinib).

Patients with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma may require prolonged dosing to decrease 
tumor size and prevent tumor growth. We therefore sought to define a minimum dose 
required to retain efficacy in preclinical models, in an attempt to inform clinical trials and 
ultimately help decrease the risk of potential toxicities in clinical testing. Furthermore, we 
tested whether we could prevent neurofibromas, if we administered MEK inhibitor to mice 
before tumors formed, and whether tumors would rebound after treatment. Here we report 
that we can significantly de-escalate drug concentrations and retain efficacy, and that tumors 
are not prevented by treatment beginning at 1 month of age, but are significantly smaller in 
size compared to vehicle controls. We also observed that tumors did not show accelerated 
growth after drug withdrawal.

Material and Methods

Mouse husbandry

We housed mice in temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities on a 12-hr dark–light 
cycle with free access to food and water as described. The animal care and use committee of 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center approved all animal use. The mice were in a 
mixed C57/129/FVBN strain background and were interbred to obtain the required 
genotype. Mouse genotyping was carried out as described (18).

PD-0325901 Dosing

We obtained PD-0325901 from Pfizer (New York City, NY). Mice were administered 
vehicle control (0.5% [w/v] methylcellulose solution with 0.2% [v/v] polysorbate 80 [Tween 
80] or PD-0325901 in the same vehicle by oral gavage for 60–90 days, at doses noted in the 
text.

MRI and Neurofibroma Volumetric Measurement

MRI in anesthetized Nf1 flox/flox; DhhCre mice using a 7T Bruker Biospec 
(Ettlingen,Germany) and neurofibroma volumetric measurement were conducted as 
previously described (14, 27).

Plasma collection

We anesthetized tumor bearing mice with iso-fluorane and collected blood by cardiac 
puncture, prior to mouse sacrifice and harvest of neurofibromas. Blood samples were 
transferred to anti-clotting EDTA tubes on ice, and centrifuged within 30 minutes of 
collection at 4°C for 15 minutes at 14,000g. Plasma was transferred to 1.5ml Eppendorf 
tubes on ice and stored at −80°C until analysis.

Pharmakokinetic analysis

PD-0325901 was quantified in mouse plasma using midazolam (MDZ) as the internal 
standard and HPLC-MS/MS (Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra). PD-0325901 and MDZ were 
removed from plasma by protein precipitation with acetone. PD-0325901 and MDZ were 
separated by a gradient mobile phase (acetonitrile: 5mM ammonium acetate) with a C-18 
column (Inertsil® ODS-3; 4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm). The Q1/Q3’s (in positive mode) for 
PD-0325901 and MDZ were 483/249 and 326/291, respectively. The lower limit of 
quantification was 1 ng/mL using 20 μL of mouse plasma. Pharmacokinetic parameters for 
PD-0325901 including area under the curve (AUC) and the elimination rate constant, kel, 
were estimated (from average data) using non-compartmental methods with add-ins on 
Excel®.

Pharmacadynamic analysis

Tumors were harvested from mice at several different time points after final dose and snap 
frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored subsequently at −80°C until further use. 
The day prior to analysis tumors were defrosted on wet ice, lysed in RIPA buffer containing 
a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt™ Protease & Phosphatase Single-Use 
Inhibitor Cocktail 100X, Thermo Scientific, Florence, KY) using the Qiagen Tissue Ruptor. 
Protein concentration was estimated using Coomassie® Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-
Rad, Berkeley, Ca). Proteins (1μg/μl) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% tris-glycine gel (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, Ca) and 
transferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membrane by electrophoresis. Membranes were 
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% TBST to minimize nonspecific binding. Antibodies 
recognizing pERK at a dilution of 1:5000 (# 4370S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and ERK 
at a dilution of 1:5000 (#4695S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) were probed ON at 4°C, 
followed the next by incubation with appropriate secondary HRP conjugated antibodies for 
1 hour at RT. Antibody binding to the membrane was visualized using the Immobilon™ 
Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Tissue sections, histology and immunohistochemistry

Formalin-fixed neurofibromas were paraffin embedded. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 
5μm thickness; sections were baked at 60°C for 1 h and air dried. Paraffin sections were

deparaffinized, re-hydrated through a graded series of alcohol to double distilled water and 
transferred to 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Slides were boiled for 10 
minutes in citrate buffer, cooled at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then rinsed in 
water twice and PBS 3 times. Sections were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block 
endogenous peroxidases for 10 minutes, rinsed in PBS, and blocked in 10% normal goat 
serum with 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody 
diluted in blocking medium; rabbit pERK (#4370, 1:200, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), 
rabbit Ki67 (1:10,000; Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako 
Chemicals, Richmond, VA, 1:2,000) and rat MECA 32 (1:10; Developmental Studies 
Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Sections were then incubated in appropriate biotinylated 
secondary antibodies; goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-rat (1:200; Vector). Some sections were 
counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. Mast cells were counted at 40X magnification in 4 
high power fields per section, 3 sections per animal in at least 3 animals per condition. Iba1 
positive cells were counted as a percentage of total numbers of cells in 3 sections per animal 
at 40X in a minimum of 3 animals per condition. Numbers of MECA+ blood vessels were 
counted in 5 × 20X fields per neurofibroma (n = 5) for each condition. Statistical 
comparisons between control and neurofibroma samples were conducted using Student’s t 
test or One Way Anova. All microscopic images were acquired with Openlab software 
suites on a Zeiss Axiovert 200.

Electron Microscopy

Mice were perfused (intracardially) with Karnovsky’s fixation solution (3% 
paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 to 7.6). 
Saphenous nerves were dissected, embedded, and evaluated as described (28).

Statistical Analysis

Neurofibroma shrinkages from the last pre-treatment value to the post treatment value were 
compared using Fisher’s exact test. Neurofibroma growth was compared by analyzing log 
transformed tumor volume data with a random effects model using the SAS mixed 
procedure (14). In the prevention model differences in axonal ensheathing by Schwann cells, 
cell proliferation, number of macrophages, number of mast cells and blood vessel 
quantification were calculated using an unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t test. In the low dose 
treatment paradigm statistical differences between groups were calculated using an Ordinary 
one way ANOVA.

Results

Prevention treatment with PD-0325901 significantly reduces neurofibroma size

Nf1 flox/flox; Dhh-Cre mice (n=23) were treated for 90 days with either vehicle (n=6) or 
PD-0325901 1.5 mg/kg (n=17). All mice in the PD-0325901 treatment group survived 
without significant weight loss. Treatment began when mice were 1 month of age, when 
tumors are not yet present, and neurofibroma volumes were measured at 4 months of age, at 
the end of the treatment period by which time neurofibromas are detectable. To increase the 
control group for statistical power, neurofibroma volumes of untreated age-matched controls

were included (n=11) (Fig. 1A). Neurofibroma volumes for the PD-0325901 treated group 
were significantly smaller compared to the control group (p=0.0003) (Fig. 1B).

We stained neurofibroma sections to evaluate underlying processes involved in 
neurofibroma growth and development. Firstly, we quantified effects of PD-0325901 on 
blood vessels per area, by staining with anti-MECA 32 (an endothelial cell marker). Very 
few blood vessels had invaded neurofibromas at the early 4 month time point, and there was 
no significant change in the number of blood vessels when mice were treated with 
PD-0325901 (Fig. 1C). Treatment with PD-0325901 highly significantly decreased 
neurofibroma cell proliferation, assessed by Ki-67 staining after 90 days of drug exposure 
(p=0.0002) (Fig. 2G). In contrast, no significant differences were found in the number of 
Iba1 positive macrophages or numbers of metachromatic mast cells per high power field 
(HPF) in PD-0325901 treated neurofibromas (not shown).

Neurofibromas are characterized by dissociation between Schwann cells and axons in nerve 
Remak bundles that are visible by electron microscopy. In normal 4 month old saphenous 
nerves 60% of unmyelinated Schwann cells ensheath >6 axons (Fig. 2A, while in vehicle 
treated Nf1flox/flox; DhhCre mice at the same age only 5% of non-myelinating Schwann cells 
ensheathed >6 axons (Figure 2C). To determine if this aspect of neurofibroma formation can 
be rescued by MEK inhibition, drug treated mice (n=3/group) were sacrificed at 4 months of 
age (Fig. 2B). The percentage of Schwann cells ensheathing >6 axons was not significantly 
improved by treatment with MEK inhibitor for 3 months, and remained significantly 
different from wild type mouse saphenous nerve (vehicle or PD-0325901 treated; p<0.0001 
and p<0.005 respectively (n=3 per group) (Fig. 2D). However, the results trended towards a 
slight improvement for the treatment group, and rare Remak bundles showed complete 
wrapping of small axons (Figure 4C, enlargement). Thus preventative PD-0325901 
treatment, despite slowing neurofibroma growth, does not rescue the ensheathment defect 
characteristic of Nf flox/flox; Dhh-Cre nerves.

To determine whether there are rebound effects on neurofibroma volume after removal of 
PD-0325901, 8 mice treated with PD-0325901 from 1 – 4 months of age were held off drug 
for three months, and then re-imaged by MRI at 7 months of age. We compared the growth 
rates of neurofibromas in the PD-0325901 group to neurofibroma growth rates of untreated 
control mice. Growth rates remained the same (p=0.9576) between the controls and the 
PD-0325901-treated group, signifying that there was no rebound i.e. no acceleration in 
growth; in other words, tumors did not grow faster than expected for this model system, but 
rather reverted to their normal trajectories. In addition, we observed that a subset of mice 
(n=3) in the PD-0325901 treatment group never developed measureable neurofibromas; the 
significance of this result is unclear based on the small numbers analyzed (Fig. 3A). Overall, 
neurofibroma volumes in the PD-0325901 group remained significantly smaller (p=0.0008) 
than expected for mice in this model system at 7 months of age (Fig. 3B).

We determined whether mice would decrease P-ERK on treatment with a MEK inhibitor 
after being off drug for 3 months. Mice were put back on treatment PD-0325901 at 1.5 
mg/kg/day; 4 mice were treated with vehicle, while another 5 mice were treated with 
PD-0325901. Mice were sacrificed after 12 days of treatment and tumor lysates analyzed by

immunohistochemistry (not shown) or western blotting (Fig. 3C). Down regulation of 
phosphorylated Erk in the PD-0325901 group was detectable 3 – 4 hours after the final dose 
when compared to the vehicle treated mice (Fig. 3C). Thus mice do not become resistant to 
MEK inhibition after one course of therapy.

Low dose treatment with PD-0325901 significantly reduces neurofibroma volume

Clinical trials have shown side effects with prolonged high-dose administration of MEK 
inhibitors (29). It is unknown whether toxicity will be problem with prolonged 
administration of lower doses. We sought to determine if lower doses than those being used 
in current studies might be effective in shrinking neurofibromas. Nf flox/flox; DhhCre mice 
(n=18) were treated with either vehicle (n=4), PD-0325901 0.5 mg/kg (n=10) or 
PD-0325901 1.5 mg/kg (n=4). The 1.5 mg/kg group served as an internal positive control 
group, allowing for comparison with previous treatment trials (27). Mice were scanned 
using MRI at 5 months of age, and re-scanned at 7 months of age to establish growth rates in 
individual mice. Mice were then treated for 2 months and finally re-imaged 9 months of age 
(Fig. 4A). All mice survived the treatment period without significant weight loss or other 
morbidity.

Eight of 10 mice treated with PD-0325901 at 0.5 mg/kg daily had neurofibromas that shrank 
over the treatment period, as compared to in-group vehicle treated mice or historical 
controls, in which neurofibromas continued to grow. This result was significant (Fig. 4B); 
p<0.001). The extent of shrinkage seen in the 0.5 mg/kg PD-0325901 group is comparable 
to the shrinkage of tumors from mice treated in-experiment with PD-0325901 at 1.5 mg/kg, 
and those treated with PD-0325901 1.5 mg/kg in Jessen et al. 2013 (Fig. 4B). We found no 
difference (p=0.69) in tumor growth trajectory between 7 and 9 months when we compared 
mice exposed to 0.5, 1.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg PD-0325901.

We analyzed tissue sections to define cellular effects in mice treated with various levels of 
PD-0325901. Numbers of blood vessels were highest in the vehicle-treated group and lower 
in both 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg group, confirming previous studies using this paradigm (27). 
Importantly, there was no significant difference on blood vessels/area between the 
PD-0325901 groups (Fig. 5A). Ki67-positive proliferating cells were significant different 
between controls and PD-0325901 treated mice (p<0.0001; vehicle vs. 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 
mg/kg respectively). Mice exposed to 1.5 mg/kg dose showed fewer proliferating cells than 
the 0.5 mg/kg treated group (p<0.0005) (Fig. 5B). Thus, PD-0325901 effects on blood 
vessels trend with efficacy (tumor shrinkage), and cell proliferation trends with the 
administered dose of PD-0325901. We also confirmed that MEK remained inhibited in 
tumor bearing mice after the final dose of PD-0325901. Pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis 
used western blotting as a read out for the MEK substrate ERK. We probed protein lysates 
from tumors (n=3/group) collected 6 hours after final dose of PD-0325901 for 
phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and total ERK. P-ERK, quantified as a fraction of total ERK, 
was similarly decreased in tumors harvested from mice treated with 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 
mg/kg PD-0325901 (Fig. 5F). Thus PD-0325901 inhibits MEK in neurofibromas, even at 
low doses.

(Nf flox/flo; DhhCre) mice. Non tumor bearing mice were given a onetime dose of drug, and 
blood was collected at 0.5, 2, 6 and 24 hours after final dose (n=3/time point/dose). 
PD-0325901 was cleared by 24 hours; thus, the maximum area under the curve was 
achieved with a single dose (Figure 5D). Maximum concentrations of PD-0325901 (Cmax) in 
non-tumor-bearing mice treated with either 0.5 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day PD-0325901 
were reached by 30 min. after dosing (tmax), the earliest time point studied. Cmax levels and 
area under the curve (AUC0-t) were 3 times as high for the 1.5 mg/kg dose in this setting, 
correlating with reduction in the administered dose. We also analyzed PD-0325901 plasma 
levels from tumor bearing mice, after 60 days of daily drug treatment (Fig. 5D). Blood 
levels of PD-0325901 were slightly lower in tumor bearing mice at individual time points as 
compared to non-tumor bearing mice. This may be explained by the duration of the 
experiment; 60 days vs. 1 day, and/or by differences caused by mouse genotype. 
Importantly, in spite of low blood levels and therefore low AUC0-t, daily dosing in mice of 
0.5 mg/kg PD-0325901 retained efficacy in the preclinical neurofibroma model system.

Discussion

Here we sought to identify effective strategies to prevent and treat neurofibromas, using a 
mouse model that accurately mimics the kinetics of human neurofibroma growth and the 
histology of the human tumors. Our results show that inhibition of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk 
pathway in the Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre mouse model, using a clinically relevant MEK inhibitor at 
1.5 mg/kg/day, significantly delays neurofibroma growth when administered prior to tumor 
development, and that taking mice off drug does not lead to a deleterious rebound effect. We 
also dose de-escalated the MEK inhibitor to a level at which efficacy was retained using (0.5 
mg/kg/day), ERK remained dephosphorylated, and blood vessels per area remained at low 
levels, even though cell proliferation was intermediate between untreated mice and mice 
exposed to higher levels of drug PD-0325901, and blood levels of PD-0325901 were low 
(under 200ng/ml by 2 hours after dosing). Therefore, daily dosing in mice of 0.5 mg/kg 
PD-0325901 retains efficacy and MEK targeting in the preclinical neurofibroma model 
system.

MEK inhibition has not previously been tested for ability to prevent neurofibroma 
formation. Based on the strong anti-tumor effect of PD-0325901 in mice with established 
neurofibromas, we hypothesized that PD-0325901 might serve as a preventative agent. 
However, while PD-0325901 significantly inhibited cell proliferation when given prior to 
tumor formation, tumor formation was not completely inhibited. There was also no effect of 
3 months of MEK inhibition on blood vessel number in 4-month-old mice. This may be 
because vessels per area are few at this time point. In contrast, the robust effect of MEK 
inhibition in animals treated later correlates with treatment times when vessels per area of 
nerve. In addition, nerves remained disrupted in mice treated with MEK inhibitor from 1 to 
4 months of age. We cannot exclude the possibility that even earlier treatment with MEK 
inhibitor, and/or a different dosing schedule, would provide improved efficacy. We prefer 
the notion that combinatorial treatments will be necessary to completely block neurofibroma 
formation, at least in this model system, because at one month of age, when treatment began 
in our study, nerves are not yet disrupted. It is possible that tumor cell death will be

necessary to achieve complete remission. Treating NF1 deficient cells, that are resistant to 
MEK-inhibitors, with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103, sensitized melanoma cells to 
MEK inhibitors (30, 31). Additional treatment with this or other inhibitors might sensitize 
neurofibromas to tumor cell death.

Notably, early intervention, before visible neurofibroma onset, did significantly delay tumor 
formation. These effects correlated with a significant inhibition of tumor blood vessels. 
These findings may be important therapeutically. In children and adolescents neurofibromas 
grow most rapidly when patients are young (32, 33), and it may be beneficial to use MEK 
inhibitors early to prevent tumor growth during the period of most robust growth to prevent 
severe disfigurement or compromised organ function.

Unlike oncology trials in which some toxicity is often deemed tolerable, NF1 patients 
remain on treatment for extended periods and may find the same side effects intolerable over 
the long term (34). Given that a dose comparable to 10 mg/kg PD-0325901 showed some 
long term toxicities in humans (29), the possibility of further lowering dose may be of 
importance for NF1 patients. Long term toxicities of MEK inhibitors at the doses now in 
human clinical trials are not yet known. We recognize that detection of toxicities may 
require extended monitoring. Depending on the plexiform neurofibroma, treatment may be 
given only during the years of active tumor growth; growth of plexiform neurofibroma 
slows down or stops in adolescence or adulthood (32, 33).

Results from oncology trials (35) and preclinical data (36) were used to estimate that 85% of 
MEK activity needs to be blocked to identify effects on cellular proliferation. It is therefore 
surprising that in mice treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day PD-0325901 in which the concentration 
of PD-0325901 in plasma was low, neurofibroma cell proliferation remained decreased 
[although reduced less than that observed at higher doses of PD-0325901], levels of P-ERK 
remained decreased, and MEK inhibition continued to shrink neurofibromas. Importantly, 
0.5 mg/kg is a dose more than three times lower than that planned to enter clinical trials. In a 
mouse JMML model, the most effective dose of PD-0325901 was 5 mg/kg/day 
PD-0325901, so it is possible that individual cell and tumor types will require different 
amounts of drug for optimal results (37)—that is, neurofibromas may be especially sensitive 
to MEK inhibition. We support the idea that clinicians define the lowest dose possible 
efficacious dose MEK inhibitor in NF1 patients with neurofibromas and other 
manifestations, to achieve maximum patient safety. However, at lower doses, the value of 
Erk as a biomarker for activity may be reduced. Our goal was to define doses at which 
neurofibromas continue to shrink, or are prevented from increasing in size. We hope that 
these studies in mice will accommodate in designing human trials in which potential 
dangerous side effects from long term treatment are minimized.

Our studies in genetically engineered mice are carried out in an effort to inform clinical 
trials. Some evidence suggests that our model is predictive. Treatment of Nf flox/flox;DhhCre 
mice with RAD001 did not alter neurofibroma growth in mice (14), nor did rapamycin 
shrink tumors NF1 human patients (Brian Weiss, personal communication). Conversely, 
treatment of mice with PD-0325901 shrank tumors, and in humans some efficacy is being 
reported in Phase I trial of AZ-D6244 (38). The interfacing of genetically engineered mouse

(39). Nonetheless, it will be wise to consider our results with some caution pending 
additional results and comparisons to human trials.

Nf1 flox/flox; Dhh-Cre (C) mice. The higher magnification in (A) indicates a well-organized 
un-myelinated Schwann cell ensheathing multiple small axons, cut in cross section. The low 
magnification micrographs in (B) and (C) show unorganized non-myelinated Schwann cells 
in Nf1 flox/flox; Dhh-Cre mice treated with vehicle (B) or PD-0325901 (C). At higher 
magnification (C, bottom) one can appreciate a rare bundle with improved Remak bundle 
organization. Percentage of grouped axons in wild type control, Nf1 flox/flox; Dhh-Cre 
vehicle treated control mice and Nf1 flox/flox; Dhh-Cre PD-0325901 treated mice at 4 
months of age (D). A high percentage (6 or more) of grouped axons per Schwann cell 
signifies normal Remak bundle organization.

Fig. 3. Neurofibromas resume growing when PD-01325901 is removed
(A) Neurofibroma volumes at 4 and 7 months of age in mice either treated with PD-0325901 
from 1 – 4 months of age (n=8), or vehicle treated/control mice (n=8). (B) Neurofibroma 
volume at 7 months of age, from mice treated from 1 – 4 months of age. Each bar represents 
the volume of neurofibromas in an individual mouse. Volumes of treated mice differ from 
those of untreated mice (p=0.0001). (C) Pharmacodynamic readout. Tumors lysates were 
prepared from mice treated with PD-0325901 for 90 days at 1.5 mg/kg, taken off drug for 90 
days and subsequently treated daily for 12 days. Tumors were harvested 3–4 hours after 
final dose. Top: phosphorylated ERK (pERK), bottom: total Erk (ERK), V= vehicle treated 
tumor, PD = PD-0325901 1.5 mg/kg treated tumors.

Fig. 4. Low Dose PD-0325901 shrinks neurofibromas
(A) Mice were MRI scanned at 5 and 7 months of age to determine neurofibroma growth 
rate. Mice were then treated for 2 months with vehicle, or PD-0325901 (0.5 mg/kg or 1.5 
mg/kg), followed by a final scan at 9 months of age. (B) Change in neurofibroma volume 
from 7 to 9 months of age in mice exposed to vehicle, PD-0325901 0.5 mg/kg or 
PD-0325901 1.5 mg/kg. Each bar displays the absolute difference in neurofibroma volume 
between 7 and 9 months in a single mouse based on serial MRI imaging. A positive value 
indicates neurofibroma size increase; a negative value indicates neurofibroma shrinkage. 
Neurofibroma volume remained significantly lower both PD-0325901 treatment groups 
compared to vehicle treated controls.

Fig. 5. MEK inhibitor retains efficacy at low doses
(A) Blood vessels per field. Immunohistochemistry with the Meca 32 antibody was used to 
highlight blood vessels. Vessels per field were reduced in the 0.5 mg/kg, showing a 
significant difference from wild type (p<0.05); a reduction in the 1.5 mg/kg group did not 
reach significance in this experiment. (B) Percentage of Iba1+ macrophages. (C) Mast cell 
number counting. (D) Percentage of Ki67+ proliferating cells. (E) Pharmakodynamic 
analysis. Blood from PD-0325901 (0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) treated non-tumor bearing 
(Nf fl/+; DhhCre) mice collected at 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 hours after a single dose of drug (n=3 
per time point/dose). Blood was also collected from tumor bearing (Nf1 flox/flox; DhhCre) 
mice 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 hours after a final dose of drug (n=3 per time point/dose). Differences 
in the PK values between wild type and knockout mice may be explained by the number of 
doses received or genotype (1 vs. 60 respectively). (F) Pharmacodynamic Analysis. 
Phosphorylated ERK (pERK): total Erk (ERK), V= vehicle treated tumor, 0.5 and 1.5 
correspond to the doses in mg/kg. Numbers are the ratio of P-ERK to total ERK for each 
sample.
