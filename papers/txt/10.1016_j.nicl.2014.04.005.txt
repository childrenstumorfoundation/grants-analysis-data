Introduction: The histopathological basis of “unidentiﬁed bright objects” (UBOs) (hyperintense regions seen 
on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans in neuroﬁbromatosis-1 (NF1)) remains unclear. New 
in vivo MRI-based techniques (multi-exponential T2 relaxation (MET2) and diffusion MR imaging (dMRI)) 
provide measures relating to microstructural change. We combined these methods and present previously 
unreported data on in vivo UBO microstructure in NF1. 

Methods:  3-Tesla dMRI data were acquired on 17 NF1 patients, covering 30 white matter UBOs. Diffusion 
tensor, kurtosis and neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging parameters were calculated within 
UBO sites and in contralateral normal appearing white matter (cNAWM). Analysis of MET2 parameters was 
performed on 24 UBO–cNAWM pairs. 

Results: No signiﬁcant alterations in the myelin water fraction and intra- and extracellular (IE) water fraction 
were found. Mean T2 time of IE water was signiﬁcantly higher in UBOs. UBOs furthermore showed increased 
axial, radial and mean diffusivity, and decreased fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis and neurite density 
index compared to cNAWM. Neurite orientation dispersion and isotropic ﬂuid fraction were unaltered. 

Conclusion:  Our results suggest that demyelination and axonal degeneration are unlikely to be present 
in UBOs, which appear to be mainly caused by a shift towards a higher T2-value of the intra- and extra- 
cellular water pool. This may arise from altered microstructural compartmentalization, and an increase in 
‘extracellular-like ’ , intracellular water, possibly due to intramyelinic edema. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the added 
value of combining dMRI and MET2 to characterize the microstructural basis of T2 hyperintensities in vivo.

1.  Introduction 

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic 
disorder, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 2700 newborns 
( Evans et al., 2010 ). The disorder is characterized by multiple caf ´e-au- 
lait spots, axillary or inguinal freckling, iris Lisch nodules, distinctive 
osseous lesions and tumors of the nervous system, such as neuroﬁbro- 
mas and optic pathway gliomas. In addition to these clinical features, 
cognitive dysfunction is the most common complication of NF1. Ap- 
proximately 80% of NF1 children experience moderate to severe im- 
pairment in one or more areas of cognitive functioning ( Hyman et al., 
2005 ; Krab et al., 2008 ). 

1.1.  Unidentiﬁed bright objects 

NF1 is associated with a number of magnetic resonance (MR) ab- 
normalities, including volumetric change in both white matter (WM) 
and gray matter (GM) ( Moore, B.D. 3rd et al., 2000 ; Cutting et al., 2000 ; 
Steen et al., 2001 ; Greenwood et al., 2005 ). In addition to these gen- 
eral changes, hyperintense foci, termed “unidentiﬁed bright objects”
(UBOs) or T2 hyperintensities are readily detected on T2-weighted 
MRI scans of children and adolescents with the disorder. Such UBOs 
are typically found in the cerebellum (dentate nuclei, middle cerebel- 
lar peduncles, cerebellar deep white matter), brainstem, basal ganglia 
and thalami ( Itoh et al., 1994 ; Van Es et al., 1996 ; Grifﬁths et al., 1999 ). 
Fig. 1 shows some examples. 

UBOs have been described as hamartomas 

1 ( Braffman et al. 1988 ), 
regions of abnormal myelination ( Smirniotopoulos and Murphy 1992 ) 
2  ( Bognanno et al. 1988 ). However, as NF1 is rarely 
or heterotopias 
lethal, to date only one histological experiment has been conducted 
to assess UBO microstructure ( DiPaolo et al., 1995 ). In this study, 
vacuoles of between 5 and 100 μm were found in the myelin sheath, 
suggesting intramyelinic edema. No evidence of any inﬂammatory 
reaction or demyelination was found and axonal loss was excluded. 
Furthermore, the white matter expressed hypocellularity and glial 
cell proliferation. 

Although UBOs may be transient and are considered benign, some 
persist into adulthood and there is increasing evidence correlating 
their presence with cognitive dysfunction ( B.D. Moore et al., 1996 ; 
Goh et al., 2004 ; Hyman et al., 2007 ; Feldmann et al., 2010 ; Piscitelli 
et al., 2012 ). Understanding the pathophysiological substrate of UBOs 
may provide a basis from which to identify which UBOs are transient, 
how they respond to pharmacological treatments and how they relate 
to the risk of cognitive complaints during childhood and adolescence. 

1.2.  In vivo assessment of UBO microstructure using diffusion MRI and 
multi-exponential T2 relaxation 

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI ) ( Le Bihan et al., 1986 ) 
can be used to investigate UBOs in vivo. dMRI relates the dispersion of 
water molecules within tissue over a short interval of time (typically 
−2 s) to microstructural features reﬂecting cellu- 
in the order of 10 
larity, membrane density and neurite orientation. In (over-) simpli- 
ﬁed terms, water moving most freely, such as in extra-axonal spaces, 
displays Gaussian diffusion, while water restricted within cells, dis- 
plays non-Gaussian diffusion. A number of different dMRI models are 
able to quantify these two types of diffusion, namely diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) ( Basser et al., 1994a ; Basser, 1995 ), diffusion kurto- 
sis imaging (DKI) ( Jensen and Helpern, 2010 ) and neurite orientation 

1  A hamartoma is tissue at its correct physiological site, growing in a disorganized 
manner, forming a focal but benign malformation. It consists of the same tissue ele- 
ments as the tissue it resides in. 

2  A heterotopia is ectopic tissue (i.e. not at its correct physiological site), co-existing 

with tissue it resides in. 

dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) ( Zhang et al., 2012 ), and are 
summarized in Table 1 . 

Previous studies using simple dMRI and DTI have reported ele- 
vated apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) in T2-hyperintense lesions 
compared to NAWM in patients ( Alkan et al., 2005 ; Tognini et al., 
2005 ) and controls ( Eastwood et al., 2001 ; Alkan et al., 2005 ; Tognini 
et al., 2005 ; van Engelen et al., 2008 ) and signiﬁcantly decreased 
fractional anisotropy (FA) values in UBO sites compared to NAWM 
( Zamboni et al., 2007 ; Ferraz-Filho et al., 2012a ; Ferraz-Filho et al., 
2012b ; Filippi et al., 2012 ). Neither DKI nor NODDI has previously 
been used to investigate UBOs. 

Multi-exponential T2 relaxation ( MacKay et al., 1994 ; MacKay et 
al., 2006 ) is a complementary MRI technique that distinguishes the 
MR signal arising from different water pools based on T2 relaxation. 
Typically three water peaks can be identiﬁed in the so-called T2 dis- 
tribution. In normal human white matter, and in a 3 Tesla magnetic 
ﬁeld, the water that is trapped between the myelin bilayers exhibits 
a short T2 relaxation time of around 20 ms, whereas intra- and ex- 
tracellular water relaxes at an intermediate rate of around 80 ms 
( MacKay et al., 1994 ; Whittall et al., 1997 ; Webb et al., 2003 ). The ﬁrst 
peak in the T2 distribution is therefore attributable to myelin water, 
while the second peak (around 80 ms) represents combined intra- 
and extracellular water. CSF has T2 values in the order of seconds. 

A summary of the measures that can be derived from dMRI and 
MET2 is provided in Table 1 , and a more detailed overview is provided 
as Supplementary material (SM1). 

1.3.  Aim of present study 

Although ﬁndings from DTI metrics are suggestive of altered tissue 
microstructure in UBO regions, the lack of speciﬁcity of measures 
derived from these techniques means that the exact nature of the 
histopathological changes arising in UBOs remains elusive. The aim 
of the present study therefore, was to use two novel, advanced white 
/
matter imaging approaches: MET2 and DKI 
 NODDI, in addition to DTI, 
to reﬁne our understanding of the microstructural basis of UBOs. By 
extension, a further aim was to demonstrate the utility of combining 
these techniques to advance our understanding of T2 hyperintensities 
arising in other pathologies and advancing age.

2.3.  Data analysis 

2.3.1.  T2-weighted FLAIR 

(cid:3)
An experienced radiologist (FD 
 A) identiﬁed white matter UBOs 
on T2-weighted FLAIR images. We excluded regions of bilateral T2- 
hyperintensities from the analysis. The T2-weighted FLAIR images 
were then resampled to 2.5 mm slice thickness and regions of in- 
terest (ROIs) were manually delineated around sites of white matter 
hyperintensities and the contralateral normal-appearing white mat- 
ter (cNAWM). 

2.3.2.  dMRI 

All datasets were visually inspected by looping through the DWIs 
in all three orthogonal views (axial, sagittal, coronal). Datasets with 
obvious artifacts (e.g. signal dropout, gross geometric distortion, bulk 
motion) were excluded. The suitable datasets were then corrected 
for motion-induced and eddy current induced geometric distortions 
with appropriate reorientation of the b-matrix using the ExploreDTI 
Toolbox ( Leemans, 2009 ; Leemans and Jones, 2009 ). Next, the result- 
ing DWIs were ﬁtted to the DTI model ( Basser et al., 1994b ), the DKI 
model ( Jensen and Helpern, 2010 ) and the NODDI model ( Zhang et al., 
2012 ). Mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity 

(AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were estimated from the diffusion 
tensor, and the kurtosis tensor yielded mean kurtosis (MK). Estimates 
of neurite density index (NDI), orientation dispersion index (ODI) and 
3 
the isotropic fraction (FISO) were obtained with the NODDI toolbox 
. The resampled T2-weighted FLAIR images were registered to the 
FA image using ANTS ( Friston et al., 2007 ; Avants et al., 2008 ) with 
diffeomorphic transformations and a pure cross correlation similar- 
ity metric. The same transformation was applied to all UBO–cNAWM 
pairs, which were then used as masks on the dMRI parameter maps. 
All parameter values in the UBO and cNAWM regions of interest were 
averaged, respectively. 

2.3.3.  Multi-exponential T2 relaxation 

The multi-echo data was ﬁrst visually checked for motion arti- 
facts and datasets with a blurred ﬁrst echo image were discarded. 
The resampled T2-weighted FLAIR data were then registered with 
the ﬁrst echo image, using the same approach as described before. 
This transformation was then applied on all ROIs. Next, decay curves 
of voxels inside each ROI were averaged and T2 relaxation distribu- 
tions were calculated using a regularized non-negative least squares 
algorithm ( Whittall and Mackay, 1989 ), correcting for non-ideal re- 
focusing pulse ﬂip angles ( Prasloski et al., 2012a ). 

Inside each ROI, the myelin water fraction (MWF) was deﬁned as 
the area underneath the T2 distribution between 10 and 35 ms relative 
to the total area. Intra- and extracellular water fraction (IEWF) was 
obtained as the relative area fraction between 35 and 220 ms. The 
geometric mean T2 time (IEW-gmT2) was calculated as described in

After obtaining average parameter values in all UBOs and cNAWM 
ROIs, we assessed whether the data was normally distributed. For 
each UBO–cNAWM pair and each parameter, an estimate of the ef- 
fect size was calculated as the difference of UBO and cNAWM values 
divided by their mean. Next the Lilliefors test was applied on the 
resulting effect sizes of each parameter. As normality could not be 
guaranteed for all parameters, a non-parametric testing was used for 
further statistical analysis. For each parameter, UBO and cNAWM pa- 
rameter values were therefore compared using a paired Wilcoxon 
signed ranks test, i.e. parameter of interest in UBO 1 vs. cNAWM 1, 
parameter of interest in UBO 2 vs. cNAWM 2, etc. This analysis was 
performed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using the signrank 
function. Resulting p -values were then corrected for multiple com- 
parisons, adopting a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) criterion. Corrected 
values were deemed signiﬁcant if p 

 0.05.

3.  Results 

As can be seen from Table 2 , from the 17 subjects, 30 UBO–cNAWM 
pairs were obtained for dMRI analysis, of which 24 also yielded suf- 
ﬁcient MET2 data quality and were located inside the FOV of the 
3D GraSE sequence. An example of the evaluated parameter maps is

cNAWM as FA was signiﬁcantly decreased (FDR — p

=
thermore, a signiﬁcantly decreased MK (FDR — p 
 0.0012) in UBOs 
compared to cNAWM was found, indicating that non-Gaussian diffu- 
sion was less present in UBOs than in cNAWM. 
The  NODDI  model  resulted  in  reduced  NDI  in  UBOs  (FDR  —

4.  Discussion 

To our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst study to investigate non- 
Gaussian diffusion and multi-exponential T2 relaxation parameters 
in children with NF1. We demonstrated a lower MK in UBOs com- 
pared to cNAWM using DKI, and a decreased neurite density (NDI) 
in UBOs with unchanged neurite orientation dispersion (ODI) and 
isotropic fraction (FISO) using NODDI. The myelin water fraction and 
IEWF were also unchanged. In contrast, increased T2 relaxation values 
of the intra- and extracellular water (IEW-gmT2) in UBOs appeared 
to be the main cause of T2 hyperintensities. We also conﬁrmed pre- 
vious ﬁndings of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and detected 
increased axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD and MD, respec- 
tively) in UBOs. 

4.1.  Which microstructural changes may be occurring in the white 
matter UBOs? 

The myelin water fraction was not altered signiﬁcantly, suggesting 
more or less intact myelin layers. This is in line with previous histolog- 
ical ﬁndings ( DiPaolo et al., 1995 ), although differences in myelin wa- 
ter content in living and post-mortem tissue mean that ﬁndings from 
our respective studies cannot be compared equivalently. Margariti et 
al. (2007) hypothesized that decreased magnetization transfer ratio 
(MTR) in UBOs represented hypomyelination in their study of NF1 
patients and healthy controls. However, decreased MTR may also re- 
late to an increase in edema or inﬂammation, without demyelination

( Stanisz et al., 2004 ; Laule et al., 2007a ; Vavasour et al., 2011 ). Given 
the unaltered MWF found in the present study, our results favor a 
hypothesis of edema formation. Further evidence comes from our 
observation of prolonged IEW-gmT2. This suggests that the intra- 
and extracellular matrix differs substantially between UBO regions 
and cNAWM, which would be expected in the case of edema or in- 
ﬂammation ( Stanisz et al., 2004 ). Other possible mechanisms of this 
prolonged IEW-gmT2 could include glial cell proliferation or reduced 
exchange between intra- and extracellular water. 

4.2.  Could UBOs be caused by intramyelinic edema? 

Having established a plausible hypothesis for edema, is it possi- 
ble to deduce in which microstructural compartment it is arising? 
In intramyelinic edema vacuoles are formed in between the myelin 
layers due to splitting at the intraperiod line. There is some evidence 
from previous work and our ﬁndings that supports the presence of 
intramyelinic edema in UBOs. For example: prolonged T2 relaxation 
times have been found in a biexponential T2 relaxation study of in- 
tramyelinic edema in cats ( Barnes et al., 1987 ) and a three-pool MET2 
model of intramyelinic edema in rats ( Harkins et al., 2013 ) also yielded 
a distinct long-T2 reservoir. The difference between the latter and our 
study is mainly that we made no assumptions about the number of 
water peaks to be found. Water compartments with similar but dis- 
tinct T2 times may therefore be expressed as a single peak having 
a prolonged T2 time. In the case of intramyelinic edema, this may 
explain why most of our UBO samples showed prolonged T2 rather 
than distinct long-T2 peaks. 

Diffuse WM lesions of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients are thought 
to be expressions of hypomyelination or intramyelinic edema, de- 
pending on treatment status ( Anderson and Leuzzi, 2010 ). Sirrs et al. 
found that diffuse white matter lesions observed in phenylketonuria 
(PKU) patients also exhibit prolonged T2 values, in the form of an 
additional reservoir ( Sirrs et al., 2007 ). 

In addition to PKU or intramyelinic edema models, prolonged 
T2  values  have  also  been  observed  in  multiple  sclerosis  lesions, 
( Armspach et al., 1991 ) in which the prolongation could be linked 
to vacuolization, increases in the amount of extracellular water or 
reduced exchange between intra- and extracellular water ( Laule et 
al., 2007b ; Laule et al., 2007c ). 

These multiple pathological mechanisms underlying prolonged 
T2 time complicate the interpretation of the origin of the prolonged 
IEW-gmT2 we ﬁnd in UBOs based on MET2 alone. 

4.3.  Can we learn more by considering the diffusion measures? 

In agreement with previous studies, decreased FA and increased 
MD were found in UBOs compared to cNAWM, suggesting altered tis- 
sue microstructure. Elevated levels of both AD and RD reveal that the 
increase in MD is not related to only one or selective directions of dif- 
fusion. The elevated mean diffusivity levels are in contrast with what 
is found in PKU, where generally MD is lower in diffuse WM lesions 
than in NAWM of healthy controls ( Dezortova et al., 2001 ; Phillips et 
al., 2001 ; Leuzzi et al., 2007 ; Vermathen et al., 2007 ). However, some 
authors have argued that lower MD in PKU lesions is more probably 
due to cytotoxic edema ( Dezortova et al., 2001 ; Phillips et al., 2001 ) 
or accumulation of hydrophilic metabolites ( Leuzzi et al., 2007 ). No- 
tably, in Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) brainstem lesions with 
reduced ADC are observed, which is not the case in similarly located 
NF1 UBOs. We might expect that intramyelinic vacuoles would lead to 
increased diffusivity levels as we found in this study. In any case, if in- 
tramyelinic edema were to be present in NF1, PKU and MSUD lesions, 
there could be differences (perhaps vacuole size or presence of debris) 
that may be revealed using combined MET2 and dMRI methods. 

The DKI model additionally indicated alterations in tissue com- 
partments displaying non-Gaussian diffusion. However, as with DTI 
parameters, the interpretation of kurtosis estimates in isolation is 
limited. The NODDI framework therefore may allow further interpre- 
tation of DTI and DKI changes by incorporating a three-compartment 
biophysical tissue model. 

Reduced NDI and unaltered ODI in UBOs suggest that the reduced 
FA is mainly caused by a lower neurite density (as deﬁned by the 
NODDI model) and not so much by increased dispersion of neurite 
orientations. This could be explained by axonal loss. However, as the 
MWF and IEWF from MET2 analysis did not change in the UBOs in 
our study, axonal loss is unlikely to be the primary determinant of 
reduced neurite density. Rather, the decreased NDI could arise from 
an increased distance between axons, for example, due to edema. 

These observations make it difﬁcult to conclude that intramyelinic 
edema is present. However, edema arising in the extracellular space 
is less likely. If that were the case, and given the Gaussian diffusion 
proﬁle of the extracellular space, FISO would be expected to increase, 
which we did not observe. Intramyelinic edema therefore remains a 
possible hypothesis. 

This combined analysis illustrates the complementary nature of 
dMRI and MET2 when it comes to evaluating T2 hyperintensities such 
as UBOs. MET2 analysis alone is not able to distinguish whether an 
increase in IEW-gmT2 is more related to changes in the intra- or extra- 
cellular water compartment. The NODDI analysis offers an indication 
of disparity between intra- and extracellular compartments, based on

differences in diffusional properties. On the other hand, dMRI mea- 
sures are less speciﬁc to myelination than the myelin water fraction 
from MET2 analysis. 

4.4.  Methodological considerations 

This study beneﬁts from the application of two advanced, novel 
MR based techniques, which has allowed us to investigate UBO mi- 
crostructure in vivo, to a degree not previously possible using con- 
ventional imaging techniques. However, there remain a number of 
limitations that should be addressed. 

Firstly, this is a small-scale exploratory study and the ﬁndings 

require conﬁrmation in a larger sample. 

Secondly, as with all studies employing image registration and 
manually deﬁned ROIs, errors arising from these techniques cannot be 
ruled out. Of particular importance in this study is the issue of partial 
volume, where contamination from CSF may inﬂuence the results. To 
minimize this, we avoided delineating ROIs near to the ventricles. We 
also used advanced diffeomorphic registration to limit registration 
errors. Another issue relates to the ROI deﬁnition itself. We used the 
well-deﬁned boundary on T2-weighted FLAIR to isolate the UBOs, 
however, it is possible that microstructural changes extend beyond 
this region ( Mizukoshi et al., 2009 ). We also used cNAWM as a control 
region, however, it is impossible to precisely deﬁne an equivalent 
contralateral region, which itself may be subject to other underlying 
disease-related tissue changes that are not visually appreciable using 
the imaging method used in this study. 

A related issue concerns differences in the size and location of ROIs. 
We used an average measure from each contributing voxel within an 
ROI. However, the variance of these measures will be inﬂuenced by the 
size of the ROI delineated. As each ROI was deﬁned by the size of the 
UBO, this issue was an unavoidable feature of our analysis approach. 
Regarding the location of the UBOs, in our interpretation we assume 
that all UBOs and cNAWM have the same underlying microstructure 
irrespective of location. However, this does not account for known 
variability in WM microstructure throughout the brain or potential 
differences between UBOs. For example, some UBOs are transient and 
others remain. We addressed this in part by limiting our analysis to 
UBOs located in WM, however, as this is a cross-sectional study, we 
do not know which, if any of the UBOs included for investigation will 
disappear over time. Rescanning the patients included in this study 
in the future will therefore be highly informative. 

Finally, although the MRI based measures utilized in this study 
are directly inﬂuenced by tissue microstructure, they remain indi- 
rect metrics based on simpliﬁed mathematical models and imperfect 
imaging techniques. While the inclusion of non-Gaussian diffusion in 
the DKI and the NODDI model is a major improvement over DTI, all 
three models assume a single dominant orientation of diffusion per 
voxel, which does not hold true in the majority of voxels which include 
healthy brain tissue ( Jeurissen et al., 2013 ). It is also unlikely to hold 
true in UBOs. Directional estimates such as AD and RD should there- 
fore be interpreted with care, as the directions they describe may not 
represent directions parallel and perpendicular to axons, respectively. 
Furthermore, NDI and ODI are designed to quantify the property of 
the tissue compartment contained within each voxel while eliminat- 
ing the contamination from free water. An unavoidable issue arises 
when a voxel is predominantly free water. In such cases, the estimates 
of NDI and ODI, although they can still be computed numerically, are 
meaningless or cannot be determined accurately. To take this into 
account, for the analysis of NDI and ODI we only considered voxels 
for which FISO

and post-processing strategies will inﬂuence the estimated MWF. For 
TE or TR may inﬂuence 
example, acquisition parameters such as 
TE used in this study allows estimation of 
the results. While the 
the MWF, to obtain the exact position of the myelin peak would re- 
quire shorter echo spacing. It is also known that shortening TR may 
increase the estimation of MWF ( Kalantari et al., 2013 ). Our study 
had a shorter TR compared to other studies. Although the inﬂuence 
on results from within-subject comparative studies like ours may be 
limited, this may have contributed to overestimated MWF values in 
our sample. Similarly, the choice of integration window used to dif- 
ferentiate the myelin water peak from the intracellular water peak 
is somewhat arbitrary within an accepted range, and this will also 
affect MWF estimation. To rule out the effect of integration window 
choice on our results (10–35 ms for myelin water and 35–220 ms 
for IEW) we repeated the analysis using ranges that may be found 
in other studies (10–40 ms, 15–35 ms, 15–40 ms for myelin water 
and 40–220 ms, 35–200 ms, 40–200 ms for IEW). Although the es- 
timated MWF did change according to integration window, this did 
not change the outcome of the statistical analysis. Nevertheless, it is 
important to note that MWF gives an indication of myelin content but 
not an exact quantiﬁcation, and there is no consensus on the optimal 
acquisition or post-processing strategies to apply. 

For these reasons, the imaging techniques used in this study will 
always lack the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of ex-vivo histological anal- 
ysis. Nevertheless, in vivo studies like ours, although imperfect, pro- 
vide data and insight that are simply not possible with histological 
analysis. 

5.  Conclusion 

We have presented ﬁndings from the ﬁrst multi-modal MET2, DTI, 
DKI and NODDI study of UBOs in NF1 patients. Results suggest that the 
NF1 related T2 hyperintensities (UBOs) can be attributed to intracel- 
lular water obtaining extracellular-like properties, causing increased 
average T2 time but stable intra- and extracellular water pool frac- 
tions. 

The ﬁndings in this initial exploratory study support the hypothe- 
sis of intramyelinic vacuolization, in the absence of demyelination or 
axonal damage. 

Combining advanced diffusion models with multi-exponential T2 
relaxation has proven useful in characterizing UBOs and therefore 
may be beneﬁcial for investigating the microstructural basis of T2 
hyperintensities in other pathologies and in normal ageing.
