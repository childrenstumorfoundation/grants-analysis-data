REVIEW

 CURRENTOPINION Development of drug treatments for
neurofibromatosis type 2-associated
vestibular schwannoma

Jaishri Blakeley

Purpose of review
To review the discoveries in molecular pathophysiology contributing to the development of
neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannomas and the recent experiences with drug
therapies for these tumors. The review includes discussion of diagnostic criteria for NF2, populations to
clinically consider for drug therapy and drug targets currently under consideration for NF2.

Recent findings
Increased insight into the complex pathways that underlie both the genetic syndrome of NF2 and the
specific pathogenesis of vestibular schwannomas has highlighted multiple potential therapeutic targets.
These discoveries have been translated into clinical trials with some early promising results. Inhibition of
angiogenesis as well as regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin and the epidermal growth factor
receptor family of receptors are the focus of current clinical investigations.

Summary
Although a great deal of work is ongoing to understand the multiple effects of the lack of the regulating
protein Merlin on tumorgenesis in patients with NF2, advances are ongoing with clinical therapeutics.
There is cause for enthusiasm based on recent results with antiangiogenesis therapy in select patients with
NF2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas; however, awareness of the notable risks and limitations of
therapies currently in development is required.

INTRODUCTION
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomal domi-
nant tumor-suppressor syndrome characterized by
schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas
that develop throughout the central and peripheral
nervous system. The birth prevalence is estimated to
be 1 in 25 000 births [1]. Patients with the most
common form of NF2 (germline mutation in the
NF2 gene) frequently present with either a focal
neurologic deficit or progressive hearing loss in their
late teens and early twenties. However, there is a
wide range of symptomatic severity in NF2 ranging
from multiple cranial and peripheral neuropathies
resulting in significant morbidity early in life to
mild hearing loss late in life [2]. The clinical hetero-
geneity is partially accounted for by a high rate of
mosaicism. Mosaicism means that there are two cell
populations, one with the NF2 deletion and one
with the normal NF2 alleles, in a single patient. In
these patients, only a subset of cells have the NF2

gene deletion and these patients often have fewer
tumors, milder symptoms, and therefore a generally
more mild course and may present later in life [2]. In
contrast, development of neurologic deficits associ-
ated with NF2 early in life generally corresponds
with a worse prognosis often related to multiple
tumors and increased neurologic morbidity [3,4].

The tumors associated with NF2 are benign in
histology; however, NF2 patients experience signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality related to their disease

Development of drug therapies for NF2 associated vestibular schwannomas Blakeley

KEY POINTS
 Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated vestibular
schwannomas are caused by loss of function of the
tumor-suppressor Merlin.

 Merlin has multiple actions both at the cell membrane

and in the nucleus.

 Early clinical efficacy has been observed with the

antiangiogenesis therapy bevacizumab in patients with
NF2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas. This has
resulted in two prospective efficacy studies assessing
bevacizumab for patients with NF2 that are ongoing.

 Small tyrosine kinase inhibitors of targets in the Ras

and Rac pathway are also in active clinical evaluation.

 There are currently no approved therapies for

progressive or symptomatic vestibular schwannomas in
NF2, but there are several promising therapies in
active development.

diagnosis of NF2 is 85% at 5 years, 67% at 10 years,
and 38% at 20 years [4]. Importantly, more recent
population studies suggest that life expectancy in
NF2 is better in the modern era than previously
reported. Specifically, using a population registry
for Northwest England, the median life expectancy
for patients with NF2 was 69.0 years [95% confi-
dence interval
(CI) 58.9–79.0 years]. Although
this is less than the general population, it is far
better than prior reports [5]. This improvement
in survival statistics may reflect improvement in
management or it may represent ascertainment bias
with patients with mosaic NF2 having improved
prognosis increasingly being recognized.

There are four established diagnostic criteria
for NF2, National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1987
and 1991 [6], Manchester criterion, and the
National Neurofibromatosis Foundation (NNFF)
criterion (Table 1) [7]. The diagnosis can be readily
confirmed if there are bilateral vestibular schwan-
nomas or a confirmed first degree relative and the
presence of an NF2-associated tumor. However,
there is diagnostic uncertainty outside of these
two scenarios. Given that roughly 50% of patients
with NF2 have a spontaneous mutation and there-
fore no family history, over time the diagnostic
criterion has become increasingly more specific to
increase the sensitivity of diagnosing patients
with non-vestibular
findings of
NF2. However, the variability in symptom presen-
tation and syndrome severity made fulfilment of
all diagnostic criteria at initial evaluation relatively
rare [7]. For example, although the Manchester
criterion was the most sensitive, only 14% of

schwannomas

patients ultimately confirmed to have NF2 could
be diagnosed at initial consultation with this
criterion. Recently, the Baser criterion was pro-
posed in order to preserve high specificity, but
increased diagnostic sensitivity at early presen-
tation [8&&]. This criterion is based on an algorithm
that accounts for age of symptom onset, the con-
stellation of symptoms, and genetic testing results
by assigning different number of points for each of
these features. If a patient is given a score of 6 or
greater, that is consistent with a definite diagnosis
of NF2. Importantly, this criterion incorporates
consideration of mosaic NF2. Although an excel-
lent addition to the field, the Baser criterion has
not yet been widely incorporated into clinical
practice or into inclusion criteria for clinical trials.

Vestibular schwannomas in
neurofibromatosis type 2
Although schwannomas can occur on any peri-
pheral nerve (cranial, spinal, or distal), the patho-
gnomonic finding of NF2 is bilateral vestibular
schwannomas. These tumors are clinically challeng-
ing as they are often bilateral, may be part of
‘collision tumors’ resulting from intersection with
neighboring schwannomas or meningiomas, they
tend to grow in ‘clusters’ along the nerve rather than
as a single schwannoma, and size does not correlate
with clinical function [9]. The most frequent symp-
tom associated with vestibular schwannomas is
sensorineural hearing loss leading to complete
deafness. However, vestibular schwannomas also
commonly cause tinnitus and poor balance, and
as they enlarge they involve the facial nerve causing
facial palsy and impact the brainstem and lower
cranial nerves. The morbidity related to NF2 vesti-
bular schwannomas can be relatively mild and
limited to unilateral hearing loss or severe, includ-
ing early deafness, facial weakness, and lower cranial
nerve and brainstem dysfunction (often resulting in
poor chewing and swallowing requiring nonenteral
nutrition and hemiparesis) (Fig. 1).

Current standard therapy for patients with NF2-
associated vestibular schwannomas is observation
for radiographically stable tumors without symp-
toms. Surgery is the standard of care for progressive
or symptomatic vestibular schwannomas [9]. In
addition, there may be a role for early surgical
resection with hearing preservation for some NF2
patients [10]. However, due to the large number of
tumors in the brain and spinal cord in most patients
with NF2, surgical removal of all tumors is not
possible or advisable as there can be significant
operative morbidity due to the location and nature
of the tumors.

Development of drug therapies for NF2 associated vestibular schwannomas Blakeley

58 year old with NF2 discovered after

unilateral hearing loss on the

left and normal hearing on the right.

27 year old with post-surgical
hearing loss on left and slow
hearing decline on the right.

14 year old with normal hearing

bilaterally and airway obstruction.

FIGURE 1. Case examples illustrating the diversity in symptoms severity in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)
ranging from unilateral hearing loss in a patient presenting in the 5th decade and lower cranial nerve dysfunction in a child.
These cases also illustrate the lack of relationship between tumor size and hearing function in NF2.

Radiation has been used in a subset of tumors
that progress despite surgical treatment or in indi-
viduals who are considered high risk for surgical
complications. However, this modality should be
used with caution since the relationship between
radiation therapy and secondary malignancy in
patients with NF2 is not fully understood [11,12].
Moreover, the efficacy of radiosurgery for NF2-
associated vestibular schwannomas appears to be
modest with only 50% of patients having tumor
control at 8 years and only 40% of patients having
preserved hearing after radiotherapy at 3 years in the
largest series reported for patients with NF2 [13].
Although surgery (and in some cases radiotherapy)
is the mainstay of current therapy for NF2-associ-
ated vestibular schwannomas, the limitations of
these approaches
for patients with NF2 have
prompted exciting developments in medical thera-
peutics for NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas.
This review will discuss the major classes of drugs in
development for NF2-associated vestibular schwan-
nomas, the underlying biology that supports their
clinical development, and the factors that influence
the clinical pathway for rare tumor syndromes.

THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 2-
ASSOCIATED VESTIBULAR
SCHWANNOMAS
The NF2 gene is located on chromosome 22q11.2 and
encodes the protein Merlin [14]. Merlin is a ubiqui-
tous protein that acts as a regulator of cell growth and

cell–cell interactions, and is expressed across several
cell types including schwann cells, meningeal cells,
mesothelial cells, and lens cells [15]. Recent discov-
eries have shown that Merlin acts both at the cell
membrane and in the nucleus [16,17].

At the cell membrane, Merlin has been shown
to regulate multiple pathways implicated in tumor-
genesis including: Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular-signal-
regulated kinases (ERK) [18], mTORC1 and 2 [19&&],
Rac/p21-activated kinase/C-Jun kinase
[20,21],
PI3K/AKT [22], and Wnt/b-catenin [23]. All of these
proposed sites of Merlin-directed regulation are
potential therapeutic targets. In addition, the ability
of Merlin to regulate the intranuclear E3 ubiquitin
ligase CRL4 (DCAF1) suggests that decreasing DCAF1
is yet another target to modulate the pro-growth
phenotype associated with inactive Merlin [16].
These recent works represent how complex the
underlying molecular pathophysiology of NF2 is
and suggest that there are multiple potential thera-
peutic targets (Table 2). However, translating these
discoveries into effective therapies will require basic
scientists and clinical scientists to work closely
together to identify the targets that have the best
portfolio for potential efficacy, tolerability and feasi-
bility for the desired patient outcome.

intracellular communication cascade integrating
signals from multiple upstream pathways as well as
the local intracellular environment. It belongs to
two complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1
is
constitutively activated in Merlin-deficient
schwannomas [24]. mTORC1 activation in turn leads
to phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and
the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1
(4EBP-1), ultimately increasing translation, protein
production, and cell growth [25]. Subsequent studies
have shown decreased phosphorylation of down-
stream targets with mTOR inhibitors
such as
rapamycin. This and recent supporting preclinical
animal data suggesting mTOR inhibition influences
vestibular schwannomas cell proliferation have led
to three ongoing clinical trials testing everolimus
in patients with radiographic progression of NF2-
associated vestibular schwannomas (NCT01345136,
NCT01490476, NCT01419639). One study has com-
pleted enrollment and the other two are in active
enrollment.

Everolimus (RAD001) is an attractive agent as
there is strong preclinical rationale in NF2-specific
models, a great deal of clinical experience with the
drug from other disease states, and it is a relatively
well tolerated and accessible drug. However, it is
worth noting that recent data suggest that both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes are differentially
deregulated in the setting of Merlin deficiency such
that targeting both mTOR complexes with the
newer mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors or with com-
bined mTOR/PI3K inhibitors may be required for
efficacy [19&&].

Epidermal growth factor receptor family
receptors
The loss of Merlin protein in NF2 has been shown
to result in abnormal activation of the epidermal

growth factor receptor (EGFR) receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) proteins. The proteins implicated
include EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3. These proteins
all span the cell membrane and contribute to
feed-back loops that regulate both cell death and
cell division. When Merlin is inactive, EGFR, ErbB2,
and ErbB3 remain constitutively active allowing
increased cell proliferation and resistance to cell
death [26]. In vitro, Merlin-deficient schwann cells
with aberrant EGFR activation respond to EGFR
inhibition [22,27]. EGFR is a common target across
many solid tumors and hence, there are many avail-
able drugs for repurposing to address this signaling
pathway in NF2-associated vestibular schwanno-
mas. However, clinical experience with the oral
EGFR inhibitor erlotinib did not result in tumor
response in patients with NF2 [28]. This raised the
questions of whether inhibition of other members
of the EGFR family was more important for NF2-
associated vestibular schwannomas growth regula-
tion.

Lapatinib is an oral dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor
approved for use in breast cancer. In preclinical
studies lapatinib was shown to have substantial
inhibition of both cell proliferation and vestibular
schwannomas growth [29,30]. On the basis of
the favorable clinical profile of lapatinib (oral, well
tolerated, known pharmacokinetics) and these
preclinical results, it is now being investigated in
two ongoing clinical studies in patients with NF2. In
a phase 0 study, lapatinib is given to patients prior to
planned tumor resection and at the time of surgery,
the tissue is collected to assess both tumor drug
concentration at steady state and assess the local
effect of the drug via target phosphorylation assays
(NCT00863122). The second study is a phase 2 study
assessing the efficacy of daily lapatinib to stop
progression of growing NF2-associated vestibular
schwannomas (NCT00973739). The phase 2 study

has completed enrollment, and results are expected
in the near future. The phase 0 study remains open
to accrual.

Antiangiogenesis pathways
Neoangiogenesis is a well recognized feature of all
malignancies. However, the contribution of abnor-
mal angiogenesis has recently been recognized in
benign tumors as well and provides a novel thera-
peutic target for NF2-associated vestibular schwan-
nomas. Vestibular schwannomas and peripheral
schwannomas have been shown to express vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both tumor
cells and associated endothelial cells [21,31]. In
addition, radiographically vestibular schwannomas
are known to have high uptake of gadolinium con-
trast suggesting high perfusion. Schwannomas have
increased mean vessel density and perivascular cell
coverage demonstrating an active angiogenesis
phenotype with more and larger vessels and abnor-
mal cellular and molecular features due to excessive
VEGF [21]. Finally, recent studies indicated that
Merlin also regulates angiogenesis via semaphorin
3F (SEMA3F), a protein that inhibits angiogenesis
[32]. In the absence of Merlin, SEMA3F is down-
regulated allowing angiogenesis [33&&]. These data
suggest that the lack of Merlin in NF2 is related to
abnormal angiogenesis via increased Rac expres-
sion.

On the basis of these observations, 10 NF2
patients at risk for complete hearing loss due to
progressive vestibular schwannomas without other
promising treatment options were offered bevacizu-
mab through compassionate use [31]. The results
were very promising with 6 of the 10 treated patients
experiencing at least 20% reduction in tumor size as
assessed with volumetrics [31,34]. Moreover, there
was functional improvement in hearing such that
four of the seven evaluable patients had improved
word recognition scores. These clinical data com-
bined with the pathological and preclinical data
supporting a role for angiogenesis in NF2 vestibular
schwannomas pathophysiology has led to two pro-
spective clinical trials assessing the efficacy of bev-
acizumab in patients with NF2 and progressive
hearing loss due to vestibular schwannomas.

The first study includes patients 14–70 years old
with progressive hearing loss due to vestibular
schwannomas. Bevacizumab is dosed at 7.5 mg/kg
intravenously every 3 weeks
for 12 months.
Improvement in hearing function is the primary
endpoint (NCT01207687). Importantly, this study
includes continued clinical measures of hearing and
tumor size off bevacizumab for 6 months in order to
assess the duration of effect of bevacizumab. This is

of clinical interest as bevacizumab has a long half
life (up to 6 weeks) and it may be that less frequent
dosing can be used for long-term maintenance
of hearing in patients with NF2-associated progres-
sive vestibular schwannomas. However, individual
studies have indicated that the therapeutic effect
with bevacizumab requires ongoing drug adminis-
tration [35]. This study also includes plasma and
radiographic biomarker data in an effort to identify
which patients are likely to have clinical benefit
from bevacizumab. Finally, quality of life data are
collected before and after treatment. Enrollment
is completed and results are expected in March
2013.

A second study will be focused exclusively on
young patients aged 12–30 years with either grow-
ing tumor or progressive hearing loss. In this study,
patients will be treated with an ‘induction’ dose
followed by a maintenance dose for a total of 2 years.
This study is planned to initiate enrollment in the
fourth quarter of 2012. These two studies will pro-
vide the medical community with important data
about the predictors of response to bevacizumab,
drug tolerability over long treatment intervals, and
the differential effects of various dosing strategies
in patients with NF2 and progressive vestibular
schwannomas. Lastly, there is an ongoing trial
assessing the local delivery of bevacizumab via
inter-arterial catheterization to vestibular schwan-
nomas. An initial study suggests this is feasible and
well tolerated; however, outcome data are not yet
available [36].

Although there is tremendous enthusiasm for
the success in hearing preservation and restoration
with bevacizumab in patients with NF2-associated
progressive vestibular schwannomas, this therapy
must be used with caution. Bevacizumab is associated
with rare, but well recognized toxicities including
thrombosis, hemorrhage, and visceral proliferation,
as well as longer-term less serious effects including
hypertension and proteinuria [37]. Hence, ideally
patients should be treated with bevacizumab only
on clinical trials or if there are no viable treatment
options due to high surgical risk for morbidity. In all
instances, bevacizumab should be administered in
a center with experience with both bevacizumab
and NF2.

Ras and downstream pathways
Ras represents a family of proteins responsible
for intracellular communication. Ras proteins are
frequently altered in the setting of tumors. Merlin
has been shown to regulate the interaction of Ras
and various growth factors [38]. As presented above,
in the past year, multiple targets in the Ras pathway

have been implicated as part of the pathogenesis of
NF2-associated tumors. Some of these discoveries
are now being translated into clinical trials.

Sorafenib is an oral multitarget inhibitor of
several targets downstream from Ras including
Raf/Mek/Erk as well as platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), VEGF, and c-kit. A phase 0 investigation of
sorafenib patients with NF2 is ongoing to assess if
the preclinical biologic markers of efficacy are
seen in patients in order to justify a larger efficacy
study. Similar to sorafenib, nilotinib is a receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of breakpoint cluster
region-abelson that also targets PDGF receptor
and c-kit. It has also shown promising NF2 in vitro
and is entering a phase 0 trial with a similar design as
described for sorafenib [39]. This includes a small
number of patients (15) receiving 2 weeks of oral
nilotinib to assess the biologic effect of nilotinib in
tumors. The results of this study will help decide if
the commitment should be made for an efficacy
study of nilotinib in NF2.

Additional therapies in development of
vestibular schwannomas
Curcumin is a natural herb that has been proposed to
have anticancer properties. It has long been proposed
as a therapy for NF2, but only recently is there evi-
dence to support a mechanism of action. Curcumin
monotherapy inhibited growth of schwannoma cells
and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, in this setting,
hsp70 was up-regulated [40&&]. Further, combination
therapy with curcumin and the hsp90 inhibitor
KNK437 worked together to suppress cell growth in
schwannomas, suggesting that combination therapy
with hsp90 inhibitors and curcumin may be a pro-
mising strategy for schwannomas.

The phosphoiniositide (PI)3-kinase/Akt path-
way is dysregulated in NF2 and may be an important
therapeutic target. The recently developed histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor AR42 works in part via
PI3K/Akt inhibition. Preclinical studies with AR42
in schwannoma cells show decreased phosphor-Akt,
apoptosis, and decreased proliferation [41]. These
promising preclinical studies have prompted a
phase 1 study of AR42 in which patients with NF2
and progressive tumors are encouraged to enroll
(NCT01129193).

Given the number of possible therapeutic
targets affected by a lack of functional Merlin, an
interesting development
the enrollment of
patients with NF2 with symptomatic tumors on
various phase 1 trials with rationally targeted thera-
pies. This has allowed evaluation of Ras, MEK, EGFR,
HDAC, mTOR, and VEGF inhibitors across a series of
patients [42].

CONCLUSION
A tremendous amount of work has been produced in
the past year about the mechanisms by which loss of
Merlin in the setting of NF2 influences vestibular
schwannomas proliferation. Some of this work has
been rapidly translated into clinical trials. Although
there is not yet an approved drug therapy for NF2-
associated vestibular schwannomas, the continued
close collaboration between basic and clinical scien-
tists, as well as the increasing insights into the
multiple pathways that regulate tumor growth in
NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas are likely to
yield a range of therapies in the next 10 years.
Careful consideration of the optimal therapies for
individual patients and the long-term requirements
for treatment will be required to screen drugs for
consideration as more potential therapies become
available for consideration.
