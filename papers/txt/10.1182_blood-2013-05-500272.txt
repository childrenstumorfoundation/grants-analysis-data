Key Points

(cid:129) Deletion/haploinsufficiency of

Asxl1 causes MDS-like
disease in mice.

ASXL1 is mutated/deleted with high frequencies in multiple forms of myeloid malignan-
cies, and its alterations are associated with poor prognosis. De novo ASXL1 mutations
cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome characterized by multiple congenital malformations. We
show that Asxl1 deletion in mice led to developmental abnormalities including dwarfism,
anophthalmia, and 80% embryonic lethality. Surviving Asxl12/2
mice lived for up to 42 days
and developed features of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), including dysplastic neu-
trophils and multiple lineage cytopenia. Asxl12/2
mice had a reduced hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) pool, and Asxl12/2
HSCs exhibited decreased hematopoietic repopulating
capacity, with skewed cell differentiation favoring granulocytic lineage. Asxl11/2
mice also
developed mild MDS-like disease, which could progress to MDS/myeloproliferative neo-
plasm, demonstrating a haploinsufficient effect of Asxl1 in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Asxl1 loss led to an increased
apoptosis and mitosis in Lineage–c-Kit+ (Lin–c-Kit+) cells, consistent with human MDS. Furthermore, Asxl12/2
cells exhibited
decreased global levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 and altered expression of genes regulating apoptosis (Bcl2, Bcl2l12, Bcl2l13).
Collectively, we report a novel ASXL1 murine model that recapitulates human myeloid malignancies, implying that Asxl1 functions
as a tumor suppressor to maintain hematopoietic cell homeostasis. Future work is necessary to clarify the contribution of
microenvironment to the hematopoietic phenotypes observed in the constitutional Asxl12/2

pool and decreases HSC
hematopoietic repopulating
capacity in vivo.

Introduction

Additional sex comb–like 1 (ASXL1) is a member of the Polycomb
group of proteins, which are necessary for the maintenance of the
stable repression of homeotic and other loci.1-5 Recently, copious
clinical studies showed that ASXL1 is altered in multiple forms of
myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN (such as chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML] and juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia [JMML]), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).6-12 Al-
terations in ASXL1 are generally associated with signs of aggres-
siveness and poor prognosis in patients with CMML, MDS,
myeloﬁbrosis, and AML.13-17 ASXL1 alterations in myeloid malig-
nancies have been reported as mutations and/or deletion, with the
majority being frameshift and nonsense mutations,6-12 resulting in
C-terminal truncation of the protein upstream of the PHD ﬁnger. A
recent study showed that truncated forms of the ASXL1 protein were
undetectable in leukemia samples with ASXL1 mutations, suggesting
that these mutations are likely “bona ﬁde loss-of-function” disease
alleles.18 However, it remains possible that truncated forms of ASXL1
resulting from ASXL1 mutations in patients exert a gain-of-function

and/or dominant-negative effect. Nevertheless, these clinical data
suggest an important role of ASXL1 in the pathogenesis and/or
transformation of myeloid malignancies. Therefore, it is important to
elucidate the role ASXL1 plays in regulating normal hematopoiesis
and pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.

ASXL1 mutations in patients with myeloid malignancies are
usually heterozygous,17 suggesting a haploinsufﬁcient effect of
ASXL1 in regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC/
HPC) functions and contributing to the development of myeloid
malignancies. Intriguingly, de novo heterozygous mutations of
ASXL1 gene occur in Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a rare condition
characterized by facial anomalies, multiple malformations, failure
to thrive, severe intellectual disabilities, and early death.19 These
results suggest that somatic mutations of ASXL1 lead to myeloid
malignancies, whereas germline ASXL1 mutations cause devel-
opmental phenotypes.

ASXL1 is mapped to chromosome 20q11, a region commonly
involved in cancers.1 Studies showed that ASXL1 regulates epi-
genetic marks and transcription through interaction with polycomb

complex proteins and various transcription activators and re-
pressors.8,20,21 ASXL1 directly associates with BAP1 to form a
PR-DUB complex, which deubiquitylates H2AK119.18,20 However,
a recent study showed that the impact of ASXL1 in leukemogenesis
does not seem to be mediated by the DUB complex.18 Importantly,
ASXL1 interacts with components of the polycomb complex PRC2,
which is involved in the deposition of H3K27me3 repressive
marks.18 Inhibition of ASXL1 function diminishes H3K27me3
histone marks, reinforcing the importance of ASXL1 in regulating
the methylation of H3K27.18 In addition, ASXL1 cooperates with
HP1 to modulate the activity of LSD1,4,21 a histone demethylase for
H3K4 and H3K9.

Multiple in vitro studies in nonhematopoietic cells have suggested
multiple activities for ASXL1, including physical cooperativity with
HP1 and LSD1 to repress retinoic acid receptor activity and in-
teraction with PPARg to suppress lipogenesis.4,21 Cooperative effects
of ASXL1 loss with other gene mutations in leukemogenesis have
been suggested by a recent study showing that shRNA-mediated
Asxl1-knockdown and NRasG12D overexpression triggered a more
severe myeloid malignancy in vivo.18 In an Asxl1-mutant mouse
model, Fisher et al reported that Asxl1 loss mildly perturbed mye-
lopoiesis but did not trigger a hematologic malignancy.22,23 The
discrepancy between ﬁndings in human patients and the reported
Asxl1-mutant model led us to wonder whether loss of function in
ASXL1 mutations is indeed causative or is a “driver” genetic event
in the development and/or progression of myeloid malignancies.
Likewise, the mechanism by which ASXL1 mutations contribute to the
pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies is of great importance in the ﬁeld.
In the present study, we generated a murine model of ASXL1
with complete knockout of Asxl1. We showed that Asxl12/2 mice
had developmental abnormalities, including dwarﬁsm, anophthal-
mia, and 80% embryonic lethality during late gestation. Approx-
imately 78% of Asxl12/2 newborns died within 1 day after birth, and
the remaining 22% of Asxl12/2 mice lived for 18 to 42 days. These
surviving Asxl12/2 mice developed features of MDS. Asxl12/2
mice had a reduced HSC pool, and Asxl12/2 HSCs exhibited de-
creased hematopoietic repopulating capacity with skewed cell dif-
ferentiation favoring granulocytic lineage. Importantly, Asxl11/2
mice also developed an MDS-like phenotype, indicating a haploin-
sufﬁcient effect of Asxl1 in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignan-
cies. Moreover, Asxl1 loss led to an increased apoptosis and mitosis
in bone marrow (BM) cells and Lin–c-Kit1 HPCs, characteristics of
human MDS. Therefore this Asxl1 murine model recapitulates patients
with MDS and provides a platform to investigate the cellular/molecular
mechanisms by which Asxl1 loss leads to the pathogenesis of myeloid
malignancies. Our animal study was approved by Indiana University
Institutional Review Board on Animal Care.

Results

Generation of Asxl1:nlacZ/nGFP knock-in and Asxl1-null
murine models

Targeted Asxl1-null mice were generated by replacing part of exon
1 sequences of the Asxl1 gene with nlacZ/nGFP (Figure 1A,

supplemental Figure 1). The targeted allele results in transcription
of nlacZ (Asxl1:nlacZ/nGFP) mRNA instead of Asxl1 (disrupting
endogenous ATG). Heterozygous Asxl1:nlacZ/nGFP (Asxl11/–)
mice were interbred to obtain homozygous Asxl1;nlacZ/nGFP
(Asxl12/2) mice. The mean litter size in Asxl11/– intercrossing
was smaller compared with wild-type (WT) intercrossing (7.4 6 2.8
pups/litter vs 10.6 6 2.0 pups/litter, P , .01). Genotypic analysis of
991 live births revealed that Asxl12/2 newborns were underrepre-
sented (Figure 1B), suggesting embryonic lethality of ;80% of
those embryos carrying both targeted alleles. This was conﬁrmed
by subsequent observation of dead Asxl12/2 embryos at embryonic
day (E) 14.5 to 18.5 (supplemental Table 1). Moreover, ;78%
of the Asxl12/2 newborn mice (52/67) died within 1 day after
birth, and the remaining 22% of Asxl12/2 mice (15/67) survived
for 18 to 42 days (Figure 1C). All surviving Asxl12/2 mice
displayed dwarﬁsm with profoundly lower body weight, albeit
the size of Asxl11/2 mice was comparable with that of their WT
littermates (Figure 1D-E). In addition, Asxl12/2 mice exhibited
anophthalmia (supplemental Figure 2A-B). These results indicate
that Asxl1 deﬁciency leads to developmental abnormalities,
including dwarﬁsm and anophthalmia.

Analyses of Asxl1 expression in BM cells

We then examined the expression of Asxl1 in BM cells of WT,
Asxl11/2, or Asxl12/2 mice by Western blot analysis with an anti-
Asxl1 antibody against Asxl1 N-terminus sequences. The full-
length Asxl1 protein expression was not detected in Asxl1–/– and
was signiﬁcantly reduced in Asxl11/– BM cells compared with
WT cells (Figure 1F). To assess whether the mutant Asxl1 allele
generates aberrant splice variants of Asxl1, the expression of Asxl1
mRNA in each genotype was analyzed with 4 different sets of
primers (supplemental Table 2 and supplemental Figure 3). The
Asxl1 mRNA expression was not detectable in the BM cells of
Asxl12/2 mice using any primer set (Figure 1G),
indicating
a complete deletion of Asxl1 transcripts in Asxl12/2 mice. The
Asxl1 mRNA expression in Asxl11/2 BM cells was decreased by
35% to 50% compared with that in WT cells (Figure 1G). The
levels of Asxl2 and Asxl3 mRNA expression were comparable in
BM cells from each genotype of mice (data not shown).

Loss of Asxl1 leads to MDS-like disease

We ﬁrst examined whether loss of Asxl1 resulted in manifestations
of myeloid malignancies in the surviving young Asxl12/2 mice (n 5 9,
18-42 days old). May-Giemsa–stained peripheral blood (PB) smears
prepared from these young Asxl12/2 mice showed dysplastic features,
including hypersegmented neutrophils, hyposegmented (bilobed)
neutrophils (supplemental Figure 4) with ﬁne nuclear bridging
consistent with pseudo–Pelger-Hu¨et anomaly, an increased number
of polychromatophilic red blood cells (RBCs), and Howell-Jolly
body in erythrocytes (Figure 2A), whereas blasts were rare. PB
counts of these young Asxl12/2 mice revealed multiple cytopenias
consistent with myelodysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis.
Leukocytopenia was observed in 3 of the 9, thrombocytopenia
was detected in 6 of the 9, and anemia was evident in 3 of the 9
Asxl12/2 mice (Figure 2B).

The BM of these young Asxl12/2 mice exhibited normo- or
hypercellularity as determined by cellularity/femur/body weight
(supplemental Figure 5A-B). Morphologic examination of the BM
of these Asxl12/2 mice revealed myeloid hyperplasia and relative
erythroid hypoplasia with smaller erythroid islands compared with
WT (Figure 2Ca-d). In addition, megakaryocytes in Asxl12/2 marrow

B cells (Figure 2D and supplemental Figure 6). The proportion of
CD41 and CD81 T cells was also increased in the spleen, which
might be relative to the decreased B-cell population (Figure 2D and
supplemental Figure 6). Collectively, these data show that Asxl1
deletion leads to a disease phenotype resembling clinical manifes-
tations of MDS in human.

Haploinsufficiency of Asxl1 is sufficient for the development of
MDS-like disease and MDS/MPN

The majority of the ASXL1 mutations in patients with myeloid
malignancies are heterozygous.6-12 We next examined whether
haploinsufﬁciency of Asxl1 is sufﬁcient for the development of
myeloid malignancies by analyzing a cohort of 10 young (3-6
weeks old) and 18 adult (6-12 months old) Asxl11/2 mice. May-
Giemsa–stained PB smears prepared from each of the Asxl11/2
mice showed dysplastic features,
including hypersegmented
neutrophils, hyposegmented (bilobed) neutrophils consistent with
pseudo–Pelger-Hu¨et anomaly, frequent apoptotic neutrophils,
hypogranulated neutrophils, and an increased number of poly-
chromatophilic RBCs (Figure 3A). Interestingly, adult Asxl11/2
mice exhibited more severe dysplasia of myeloid lineage than
young Asxl11/2 mice, indicating disease progression. The age-
dependent disease progression in Asxl11/2 mice was also sub-
stantiated by the PB counts and histologic and ﬂow cytometric
analyses. The adult Asxl11/2 mice displayed a higher frequency of
anemia and thrombocytopenia than did the young Asxl11/2 mice. In
addition, white blood cell (WBC) counts of adult Asxl11/2 mice were
more heterogeneous, with many mice showing leukopenia, including
neutropenia, and some mice displaying leukocytosis and monocytosis
(Figure 3B). Absolute monocytosis/neutrophilia was identiﬁed in
4 of the 18 adult Asxl11/2 mice (22%) but in none of the young
Asxl11/2 mice (Figure 3B). The presence of anemia, thrombocy-
topenia, leukocytosis, absolute monocytosis/neutrophilia, and dys-
plasia is consistent with human MDS/MPN, especially CMML.
Histologic analysis of spleen and liver sections of the adult
Asxl11/2 mice showed disrupted splenic architecture, with an
increased proportion of myeloid cells, and perivascular myeloid cell
inﬁltration in the liver (Figure 3C). BM histologic sections of adult
Asxl11/2 mice revealed an increase in the proportion of myeloid cells
and relatively decreased erythroid islands (Figure 3D). Compared
with their WT counterparts, adult Asxl11/2 mice showed an
increased myeloid/erythroid ratio (WT 5 2.6 6 0.3, Asxl11/2 with
MDS-like disease 5 4.2 6 1.2; P , .05 and Asxl11/2 with MDS/
MPN 5 6.5 6 2.1, P , .01; n 5 4-5). Dysplastic myeloid cells were also
frequently seen in Asxl11/2 BM (Figure 3D). Flow cytometric analysis
conﬁrmed the increased granulocytic/monocytic (Gr-11/Mac-11) and
decreased B2201 B-cell populations in the BM and spleen of adult
Asxl11/2 mice, whereas the proportions of CD41/CD81 cell pop-
ulations in the BM and spleen were comparable (Figure 3E, sup-
plemental Figure 7). These data suggest that haploinsufﬁciency of Asxl1
is sufﬁcient to cause MDS-like disease and/or MDS/MPN in mice.

Notably, one Asxl11/2 mouse (B8) developed overt disease and
became moribund at 16 months of age. In addition to elevated WBC
counts and anemia (supplemental Table 3), necropsy revealed spleno-
megaly and a large mass in the uterus (supplemental Figure 8A). Flow
cytometric analysis indicated that this mass was composed of Gr-11/
Mac11 cells, suggesting myeloid sarcoma (supplemental Figure
8B-C). A tumor transfer assay showed that transferring 1 3 106
spleen cells from this aged, end-disease stage Asxl11/2 mouse
successfully caused neutrophilia/monocytosis and splenomegaly
in sublethally irradiated WT recipients, verifying the malignant

nature of the cells from the moribund Asxl11/2 mouse (supplemental
Figure 8D). On the basis of the Bethesda proposals for classifying
nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice,24 the pathology in
this moribund Asxl11/2 mouse met the criteria for myeloid leukemia
with maturation (neoplastic cells showed some maturation, more than
20% immature forms/blasts in the BM, supplemental Figure 8E-F).
Collectively, heterozygous deletion of Asxl1 leads to the development
of MDS-like disease in mice, some of which could progress/transform
to MDS/MPN and myeloid leukemia (Table 1, supplemental Table 3).
Approximately 14% of the Asxl11/2 mice (up to 16 months) became
moribund or died as a result of severe myeloid malignancies
(Figure 1C). These ﬁndings are signiﬁcantly clinically relevant
because ASXL1 mutations are associated with a more aggressive
clinical course in MDS/CMML patients and have a high risk to
progress to leukemia.13-17

Asxl1 loss leads to increased apoptotic and mitotic cells in BM

Increased apoptosis and cell proliferation are characteristic features
of MDS.25 We next examined whether Asxl1 loss affected the
apoptosis and mitosis of BM cells. May-Giemsa–stained BM cell
cytospin preparations revealed a higher proportion of apoptotic and
mitotic cells in Asxl11/2 and Asxl12/2 BM compared with WT BM,
in which apoptotic and mitotic cells were rarely seen (supplemental
Figure 9A). When BM cells were evaluated for apoptosis by
Annexin V/7-AAD staining after 18-hour starvation, starvation-
induced apoptosis was signiﬁcantly greater in Asxl11/2 and Asxl12/2
BM cells compared with WT controls (supplemental Figure 9B-C). In
addition, when freshly isolated BM Lin–c-Kit1 cells were analyzed
for apoptosis (Figure 4A-B) and cytokine cocktail–stimulated
Lin–c-Kit1 cells were analyzed for cell-cycle proﬁling (Figure 4C),
a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells and cells of S/G2/
M phases were observed in Asxl12/2 Lin–c-Kit1 cells than that in
WT cells. Asxl11/2 Lin–c-Kit1 cells also contained a higher pro-
portion of apoptotic cells than did WT controls (Figure 4A-B).
Furthermore, examination of May-Giemsa–stained cytospin prepara-
tions of colonies derived from Asxl11/2 or Asxl12/2 BM cells
(with mSCF, mIL-3, EPO, and IL-6 for 8 days) revealed dramatically
increased proportions of mitotic cells compared with WT BM
cell–derived colonies (Figure 4D-E). A signiﬁcantly higher pro-
portion of mitotic cells was also noted in Asxl12/2 BM cell–derived
colonies than in Asxl11/2 BM cell–derived colonies. These data
indicate that Asxl1 loss in mice resulted in increased apoptosis and
mitosis of BM cells, consistent with cellular phenotypes of human
MDS.

Altered HSC and myeloid progenitor populations in
Asxl12/2

mice

To determine whether deleting Asxl1 affects the HSC/HPC pool in
vivo, we analyzed the Lin–Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) and Lin–Sca1–c-Kit+
(LK) cell populations in the BM of young WT, Asxl11/2, and Asxl12/2
mice (3-6 weeks old). The proportion of LSK cells, but not LK cells,
was signiﬁcantly decreased in young Asxl12/2 mice compared with
WT controls (Figure 5A-C). When the myeloid progenitor popula-
tions were analyzed within the LK populations, the percentage of
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) population was higher,
whereas megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) population was
lower in the BM of Asxl12/2 mice compared with that of WT and
Asxl11/2 mice (Figure 5D-E). Consistently, colony assays revealed
a moderate decrease in colony-forming unit (CFU)-C and burst-
forming unit–E frequency of Asxl12/2 BM cells compared with WT

MDS compared with age-matched WT controls (supplemental
Figure 10A-C). Moreover, the GMP frequency was dramati-
cally increased and MEP frequency signiﬁcantly decreased in
adult Asxl11/2 mice with MDS/MPN but not in adult Asxl11/2
mice with MDS (supplemental Figure 10D-E). Consistently, the
BM and spleen cells of adult Asxl11/2 mice with MDS/MPN
contained higher frequencies, and adult Asxl11/2 mice with
MDS had lower frequencies, of CFU-C compared with WT con-
trols (supplemental Figure 10F-G). These data suggest that Asxl1
haploinsufﬁciency differentially alters HSC/HPC pools as animals
develop different spectrum of myeloid malignancies.

Asxl1 loss impairs hematopoietic repopulating capacity

We next performed a competitive repopulation assay to determine
whether deleting Asxl1 affects the cell fates of HSCs in vivo. When
PB was determined for donor chimerism 1, 2, 4, 6, or 10 months
after transplantation, the CD45.2 chimerisms remained ;50% in
mice receiving WT BM cells, whereas a steady decline in the
CD45.2 chimerism was observed in mice receiving Asxl11/2 or
Asxl12/2 BM cells, with a signiﬁcantly lower CD45.2 chimerism in
mice receiving Asxl12/2 BM cells (Figure 6A). At month 10, the
CD45.2 chimerism decreased to less than 10% in the PB of mice
receiving Asxl12/2 BM cells. Consistent with PB, the CD45.2
chimerism was signiﬁcantly lower in the BM of mice receiving
Asxl12/2 or Asxl11/2 BM cells than in the mice receiving WT BM
cells (Figure 6B). Interestingly, Asxl12/2 BM cells contributed to
a greater proportion of Gr-11/Mac11 granulocytic/monocytic cells,
a smaller proportion of B2201 B cells, and signiﬁcantly smaller
proportions of LSK and LK HSC/HPCs in the recipient BM com-
pared with the WT controls. In addition, serial transplantation
showed a stable BM CD45.2 chimerism (range 42%-52%) in WT
BM transplants, whereas BM CD45.2 chimerism decreased upon
each round of Asxl11/2 or Asxl12/2 BM transplantation, with a
sharper decline in Asxl12/2 BM transplants (Figure 6C). These data
suggest that Asxl1 deletion/haploinsufﬁciency impairs the long-term
repopulating capacity and self-renewal of HSCs and likely confers
a skewed differentiation toward granulocytic/monocytic lineage in
vivo.

Deletion of Asxl1 altered expression of genes implicated in
apoptosis regulation and reduced global levels of H3K27me3
and H3K4me3 in Lin–c-Kit

cells

1

The Polycomb group of proteins maintains the “off state” of the
clustered homeotic box (Hox) genes, and Asxl1 is a member of the
Polycomb group of proteins.26 We then determined whether deletion
of Asxl1 leads to altered expression of HoxA genes (HoxA5/7/9/10) in
Lin–c-Kit1 cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
The expression of each of these HoxA genes was signiﬁcantly higher
in Asxl12/2 BM Lin–c-Kit+ cells than in WT Lin–c-Kit+ cells
(Figure 7A). Asxl12/2 Lin–c-Kit+ cells are characterized by increased
apoptosis. We therefore examined the expression of several genes
implicated in apoptosis regulation, including Bcl2, Bcl2l12, and
Bcl2l13. Bcl2l13 (an apoptosis facilitator) was upregulated, whereas
Bcl2 and Bcl2l12 (pro-apoptotic genes) were downregulated in
Asxl12/2 Lin–c-Kit+ cells (Figure 7A), which might contribute to the
increased apoptosis of Asxl12/2 Lin–c-Kit+ cells.

ASXL1 knockdown has recently been shown to signiﬁcantly
reduce global H3K27me3 levels in myeloid cells.18 We next ex-
amined whether deleting Asxl1 altered the global H3 methylation
states in Lin–c-Kit+ cells. Western blot analysis with nuclear
extracts of Lin–c-Kit+ cells showed decreased levels of global
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in Asxl12/2 Lin–c-Kit+ cells compared
with WT and Asxl11/2 Lin–c-Kit+ cells (Figure 7B). These results
indicate that Asxl1 is required to maintain H3 methylation states in
HSC/HPCs.

importance of ASXL1 mutations in the
Despite the clinical
myeloid malignancies, the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underpinning the ASXL1 loss–mediated pathogenesis of myeloid
malignancies remains largely unknown. In the present study,
using our newly generated Asxl1 knockout murine model, we
made several important observations. First, Asxl1 deletion in
mice led to developmental abnormalities including dwarﬁsm and

anophthalmia. Second, Asxl12/2 mice developed a phenotype
resembling many characteristics of MDS. Third, deletion of
Asxl1 reduces the HSC pool and decreases HSC hematopoietic
repopulating capacity in vivo, which is associated with increased
apoptosis and mitosis. Fourth, Asxl11/2 mice also developed
a mild MDS-like disease, which could progress to MDS/MPN,
demonstrating a haploinsufﬁcient effect of Asxl1 in the pathogenesis
of myeloid malignancies.

De novo mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been shown to
account for approximate 50% cases of Bohring-Opitz syndrome,
which is a rare disease characterized by facial anomalies, multiple
malformations, failure to thrive, and severe intellectual disabil-
ities.19 This severe condition often leads to death at an early age,
preventing knowledge of whether susceptibility to myeloid malig-
nancies might result from ASXL1 germ-line mutations. Fisher et al
showed that Asxl1-mutant mice exhibited alterations of the axial
skeleton.23 In this study, we showed that Asxl1-deletion caused
multiple developmental defects in mice including dwarﬁsm and
anophthalmia. The mechanisms by which Asxl1 deletion causes
developmental defects needs to be elucidated.

The majority of myeloid malignancy patients with ASXL1 muta-
tions retain a WT copy and a mutant allele of ASXL1, which leads to
function.6-12 Therefore
nonsense/frameshift, suggesting loss of
ASXL1 has been speculated to be a putative tumor suppressor
gene that is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid
malignancies. Consistent with the clinical genetic characteristics,

haploinsufﬁcient loss of Asxl1 in mice leads to the development
of MDS-like disease. These data provide persuasive functional
evidence that haploinsufﬁciency of Asxl1 is sufﬁcient to cause
MDS-like disease in vivo. In addition, a subset of Asxl11/2 mice
progress to MDS/MPN as they age, displaying neutrophilia
and/or monocytosis, and an increased number of granulocytic/
monocytic cells in the BM, suggesting that ASXL1 loss can lead
to myelomonocytic expansion. This is consistent with the obser-
vations that ASXL1 mutations are common in CMML, which is
classiﬁed as a MDS/MPN.6-12 Clonal dominance is a deﬁning
feature of MDS. Concomitant mutations have been frequently found in
myeloid malignancy patients with ASXL1 mutations. It is possible that
Asxl11/2 mice could acquire mutations in critical genes, promoting the
clonal dominance over time. Indeed, MDS in 1 aged Asxl11/2 mouse
progressed to myeloid leukemia, which was transferable into sub-
lethally irradiated na¨ıve WT recipient mice. Multiple clinical
studies have shown that mutations in ASXL1 are associated with
signs of aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients with
CMML, MDS, myeloﬁbrosis, and AML.13-17 In MDS and CMML,
ASXL1 mutations are frequently present in chronic phases and
precede transformation.27 Data obtained from the animal model are
consistent with these clinical observations.

Increased apoptosis and mitosis of hematopoietic precursors are
characteristic cellular features of human MDS.25 Bouscary et al
reported that the proliferation of dysplastic clones is likely ac-
companied by a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis.28 We consistently

study cannot rule out a possibility that an altered microenvironment
may contribute to the hematopoietic phenotype and myeloid ma-
lignancy development observed in the constitutive Asxl1-deﬁcient
murine models. However, the competitive transplantation data
suggest an intrinsic effect of Asxl1 in regulating HSC/HPC
function.

Interacting with histone-modifying enzymes including EZH2
and LSD1, Asxl1 deletion globally decreases H3K27me3 and
H3K4me3 in Lin–c-Kit1 cells, consistent with Abdel-Wahab et al’s
observation that Asxl1 knockdown resulted in diminished H3K27me3
histone mark in leukemia myeloid cell lines.18 H3K4me3 is associated
with transcriptional competence and activation, whereas H3K27me3
and H3K9me3 are frequently associated with repressed gene
expression.34-37 It would be logical and important to interrogate
the dysregulated gene expression with the genomic alteration of
histone marks identiﬁed by Chip-Seq experiments.

Collectively, our results demonstrate that deletion/haploinsufﬁciency
of Asxl1 in mice is sufﬁcient to recapitulate disease manifesta-
tions of patients with MDS and MDS/MPN, implying that Asxl1
functions as a tumor suppressor in myelopoiesis. The current
ASXL1 murine model provides an ideal platform for unveiling
the detailed mechanisms of Asxl1 loss–mediated multiple-step
pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies and for testing novel
therapeutic agents for myeloid malignant patients with ASXL1
alterations.

observed an increased apoptosis and mitosis in Asxl11/2 and
Asxl12/2 BM and Lin–c-Kit+ cells, which could result
in the
ineffective hematopoiesis and high risk of leukemic transformation
in these mice. The upregulated apoptotic facilitator, Bcl2l13, and
downregulated anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl2 and Bcl2l12, in Asxl12/2
Lin–c-Kit1 cells could play a critical role in their increased apoptosis.
Interestingly, myeloid progenitors of the NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic
MDS mice have been shown to have an increased rate of apoptosis,
which is also associated with a reduction in Bcl2.29

Although truncated forms of the ASXL1 protein were undetect-
able in leukemia samples with ASXL1 mutations in a recent study,
suggesting that these mutations are likely loss-of-function disease
alleles,18 this still cannot deﬁnitively eliminate the possibility that
truncated forms of ASXL1 resulting from ASXL1 mutations in
patients exert a gain-of-function and/or dominant-negative effect. In
vivo studies using transgenic or knock-in strategies to express
truncated Asxl1 proteins in mice are warranted to thoroughly
clarify this possibility.

Aberrant apoptosis and/or senescence may alter the HSC/HPC
pool in vivo. Indeed, Asxl12/2 mice had a decreased HSC pool. In
a competitive reconstitution assay, Asxl12/2 HSC/HPCs exhibited
a reduced HSC self-renewal and long-term hematopoietic repopu-
lating capacity with a skewed cell differentiation, favoring granu-
locytic lineage. These data together with the increased apoptosis
in Asxl12/2 HSC/HPCs suggest that Asxl1 regulates HSC/HPC
cellular functions. The ASXL1 gene can be translocated and fused to
the PAX5 gene in B-acute lymphoblastoid leukemia.30 Recent
genome sequencing studies revealed low frequencies of ASXL1
mutations in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia,31 but not in T-cell–acute
leukemia.32 Although we did not observe lymphoid malignancies in the
cohort of Asxl12/2 and Asxl11/2 mice, deletion/haploinsufﬁciency
of Asxl1 did cause impaired B-cell development, consistent with
a previous report by Fisher et al.23 Studies using B- or T-cell
lineage–speciﬁc Asxl1 inactivation may be necessary to further
clarify the exact role of Asxl1 in B- and T-cell development,
respectively. Furthermore, increasing evidence has been shown
that the BM microenvironment plays an important role in the
development and progression of myeloid malignancies.33 Our
