Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with a variety of man-
ifestations, including orthopedic complications such as scoliosis and tibial pseudarthrosis. Orthopedic man-
agement of these skeletal complications is rendered more challenging due to a lack of standardized
adjunctive pharmacotherapies. NF1 leads to disruption of the canonical Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK axis, and this
has been associated with defects in bone anabolism. The roles of other non-canonical Ras effector pathways,
such as the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway, are less well understood. In this study we examine the
effects of an anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) on inducible osteoprogenitors as well as Nf1-de-
ﬁcient and Nf1-null primary osteoblasts.
C2C12 cells, which are highly responsive to rhBMP-2, were examined with exogenous rhBMP-2 and a range
of SP600125 doses. Based on the expression of early and late bone markers and matrix mineralization, 10 μM
SP600125 was found to be pro-osteogenic whether delivered concurrent with or following 2 days of rhBMP-2
treatment. Aberrant JNK activity was identiﬁed in Nf1-deﬁcient osteoprogenitors (increased rhBMP-2 in-
duced phospho-c-Jun) and in Nf1-null mature osteoblasts (increased total c-Jun). Next, SP600125 was used
to treat these cells and was found to facilitate osteogenesis in Nf1-deﬁcient osteoprogenitors, and in Nf1-
null osteoblasts when given in conjunction with rhBMP-2. Outcome measures included alkaline phosphatase
activity, matrix mineralization, and osteogenic gene expression. In summary, JNK inhibitors represent a class
of potentially useful adjunctive agents for orthopedic medicine, particularly in the context of NF1.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects ap-
proximately 1:3000 individuals. The NF1 disease state is associated with
a range of clinical manifestations but orthopedic complications such as
congenital tibial dysplasia and progressive scoliosis can be among the
challenging to manage and can signiﬁcantly impair the patients' quality
of life. Even with bracing and conservative management, fracture is usu-
ally inevitable and the resulting deﬁcient bone repair typically results in
a pseudarthrosis. Pre-clinical studies have suggested that deﬁciencies in
bone anabolism [1] and excessive bone catabolism [2] may be the un-
derlying cause of the pathology.

Historically, orthopedic treatment of a pseudarthrosis focused pri-
marily on achieving stable ﬁxation, removing any aberrant ﬁbrotic tissue,
and providing an anabolic stimulus. One generalized approach to im-
proving repair involves conjunctive treatment with an anti-resorptive
drug, such as a bisphosphonate. In a preclinical mouse model of NF1
that shows defective bone repair [1], combination therapy with
rhBMP-2 and bisphosphonate led to improved healing [3]. However,

this represents a broad approach that does not target the speciﬁc signal-
ing deﬁciencies associated with the NF1 state.

The NF1 gene encodes the protein neuroﬁbromin, a Ras GTPase [4]
that is expressed in a variety of cell types including osteoblasts and
osteoclasts [5]. NF1 deﬁciency is associated impaired osteogenesis
as well as increased osteoclast differentiation and function [2,6].
While disruption to the canonical Ras-Raf-1/MEK/ERK axis is the nor-
mal mechanism attributed to decreased anabolism [7], phosphatidyli-
nositol 3 phosphate kinase (PI3-K) signaling has been linked to the
oversensitivity of the osteoclasts [2]. The role of other non-canonical
Ras effecter pathways in mediating the poor bone healing seen in
NF1 is unclear.

A recent study identiﬁed increased JNK activity in murine Nf1+/−
microglia [8]. Treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 ameliorated
the phenotype in Nf1+/− microglial cells and in an Nf1+/− mouse
model of optic glioma. The relative activity of the JNK pathway and its
role in regulating the NF1 bone phenotype has not yet been investigat-
ed. However, should the JNK pathway modulate the bone effects, this
could represent a new and targeted pathway for
therapeutic
intervention.

To investigate the importance of JNK signaling in bone, we exam-
ined cells isolated from wild type (Nf1+/+) mice, Nf1-deﬁcient mice
(Nf1+/−), and Nf1 null (Nf1null) cells generated by treating primary
cells from Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice with a Cre-expressing adenovirus. JNK

activity based on c-Jun phosphorylation and MAPK activity was
assayed by western blot following growth factor stimulation with
rhBMP-2. The effects of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on immortalized
inducible osteoprogenitors, as well as primary Nf1+/+, Nf1+/−, and
Nf1null osteoblasts from mice were examined in culture, with and
without exogenous rhBMP-2 treatment. Functional outcome mea-
surements included enzymatic assays, matrix mineralization and ge-
netic bone markers. We hypothesized that JNK activity would be
overactive in NF1-deﬁcient cells, and that functional osteoblast deﬁ-
ciencies in these cells could be overcome with a speciﬁc JNK inhibitor.

Materials and methods

Animal models

Heterozygous Nf1-knockout mice (Nf1+/−) ubiquitously deﬁcient
for one allele were sourced from L. Parada (UT Southwestern, Dallas,
TX) and were maintained by backcrossing to wild type C57BL/6J mice
[9]. The conditional Nf1 line (Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox) generated by Prof Luis Parada
was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) mouse reposito-
ry (Bethesda, MD, United States) [10]. All animal experiments were ap-
proved by the Southwest Area Health Service (SWAHS) Animal Ethics
Committee. Genotyping was performed using a PCR-based method to
differentiate between heterozygous and wild-type animals.

Cell culture

C2C12 myoblasts are an immortalized myoblastic cell line that is
highly sensitive to bone morphogenetic protein stimulation and subse-
quent osteogenic stimulation [11]. C2C12s were cultured in Dulbecco's
modiﬁed eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Invitrogen). For experimental work, C2C12 cells were seeded
on collagen coated plates at a density of 2×104 cells/well in 48-well
plates and 1.5×105 in 6-well plates. BMSCs were seeded at a density
of 1×105 cells/well in 48-well plates and 2.5×105 cells/well in 6-well
plates without collagen-coating. Osteogenic differentiation was in-
duced by culturing cells in osteogenic media containing α-MEM, 10%
FBS and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate.

Primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were selected as an in-
ducible osteoprogenitor population. Primary BMSCs were obtained
from 8 to 12 week old Nf1+/− mice and Nf1+/+ (wild type) littermates.
Cells were isolated from the femoral medullary canal by ﬂushing with
DMEM using a 21-gauge needle. Cells adherent after 5 days of culture
in DMEM with 10% FBS were passaged once for subsequent experi-
ments [12]. Drug interventions were performed in multi-well plates
after cells had reached at least 80% conﬂuence in the osteogenic
media previously described.

Primary neonatal calvarial cells were examined as a committed
osteoprogenitor population. Cells were isolated from Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox neo-
nates within 1 week of birth using a modiﬁed version of our previously
published methodology [13]. In brief, mice were decapitated and the
calvaria stripped of all ﬁbrous tissue and washed with PBS. Bones
were digested three times for 15 min in Collagenase D (Roche) at
1 mg/ml in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) (Invitrogen) at
37 °C. Isolated cells were grown in 10% FBS in α-MEM for 3 to 5 days.
All cells were cultured with antibiotics consisting of 100 unit/ml peni-
cillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and grown in a humidiﬁed incubator
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To generate Nf1null cells in vitro, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox calvarial
cells were treated with Adeno-Cre virus. Cells were seeded at 1×105
cells/well of a 6-well plate and transduced with Adeno-Cre virus and
Adeno-GFP control viruses (1×107 infectious units/ml) (provided by
Dr. Gajewski, University of Chicago, USA and Dr. Alexander, Children's
Medical Research Institute, Sydney, Australia, respectively) using 30 μl
GeneJammer (Stratagene) in α-MEM with 5% FBS. Genejammer is a
transfection reagent that has been previously reported to improve ade-
noviral transduction efﬁciency [14]. Cells were serum starved for 4 h

prior to the 18 hour transduction phase. The previously described oste-
ogenic media was used during drug treatments.

Recombinant proteins and drugs

Cells were cultured with 0, 50, or 200 ng/ml rhBMP-2 (Medtronic),
with the media changed every third day. SP600125 inhibitor
(Sigma-Aldrich) was trialed at a concentration range of 0–50 μM.
DMSO vehicle concentrations were less than 0.1% (v/v) media and con-
sistent in all wells to avoid potentially confounding pro-osteogenic ef-
fects of DMSO [15].

Cell viability and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity assays

Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was quantiﬁed using p-
nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) (Sigma-Aldrich) enzymatic assays
and normalized to viable cell number measured using the CellTitre
96Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) [13].
Brieﬂy, live cell number was assayed using the Promega reagent as
per the manufacturer's instructions. Next, cells were ﬁxed with 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and washed with an AP wash buffer
(0.1 M NaCO3 pH 10, 1 mM MgCl2) and then incubated with 10 mM
pNPP for 10 min (C2C12s) or 20 min (BMSCs) at room temperature.
AP activity was based on A405 readings from triplicate assays normal-
ized to cell number.

Matrix mineralization staining

Mineralized calcium deposits were directly assessed by Alizarin
Red S staining. Monolayers of differentiated osteoblasts at day 10
(rhBMP2-induced C1C12s and calvarial cells) and day 14 (BMSCs)
were ﬁxed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature and then
stained with Alizarin Red S for 10 min (40 mM, pH 4.2) and then
washed ﬁve times with distilled water to remove non-speciﬁc stain-
ing. Assays were performed in triplicate.

RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells grown in 6-well plates
using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was then used
with equivalent amounts of RNA to obtain cDNA. The Gapdh (5′-
GCCACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGGC-3′;
5′-GTGGTGGACCTCATGGCCTA-
CATG-3′), alkaline phosphatase (Alp) (5′-GGGACTGGTACTCGGATAACG
A-3′; 5′-TGCAAGGAC ATCGCATATCAG-3′), osteocalcin (Ocn)
(5′-
5′AAGGTAGTGAACAGACTCCGGC-3′),
CGGCCCTGAGTCTGACAAA-3′;
and osterix (Osx) (5′-CGTCCTCTCTGCTTGAGGAA-3′; 5′-AAAGGTCAGCG-
TATGGCTTC-3′) sequences were ampliﬁed using SYBR Green I PCR re-
agent kit (Integrated Sciences) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. PCR was performed on the Rotor-Gene 3000 (QIAGEN). Sam-
ples were denatured at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 ampliﬁcation cy-
cles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for Alp, Ocn and Osx
and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for Gapdh.
These thermal cycling programs were followed by a ﬁnal extension at
72 °C for 60 s. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and normalized
to the housekeeping gene Gapdh, to control for cDNA loading. Data are
presented as mean fold induction (±standard error).

Ras activity pull-downs and western blotting

Activated Ras was detected using Ras activity pull-down assays
(New East Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. Sam-
ples were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the active-Ras antibody
and A/G Agarose Beads. The beads were pelleted, washed and resus-
pended in 30 μl 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were then

K. Sullivan et al. / Bone 49 (2011) 1311–1316

heated to 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine
polyacrylamide gels (Biorad).

Western blots were performed as described previously [3]. Primary
antibodies were diluted at 1:1000 for anti-Ras (New East Biosciences),
anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-c-Jun, anti-p42/44 and anti-phospho-
p42/44 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). The
anti-Gapdh antibody (Millipore) was diluted at 1:5000. Horseradish per-
oxidase-tagged secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used for de-
tection by chemiluminescence with exposure to Biomax ﬁlm
(Amersham Biosciences). Each western blot was performed once on sin-
gle freeze thawed samples to prevent protein degradation. The blots were
probed ﬁrst for an individual signaling molecule and reprobed for Gapdh.
Analysis of the blots was performed by band densitometry using
ImageJ software, with bands measured in duplicate. Values from cell
signaling antibodies were normalized to Gapdh.

Statistical analysis

Values are presented as mean±standard error (SE), and statistical
comparisons were made using a two-tailed student's t-test. Values of
p b0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

JNK inhibitors increased osteogenic markers in C2C12 myoblasts

The effects of JNK inhibition on BMP-induced osteogenesis were ex-
amined in culture. C2C12s were treated with a low dose of rhBMP-2
(50 ng/ml) with and without JNK inhibitors for 10 days. Consistent
with previous reports, this low rhBMP-2 dose poorly stimulated bone
markers, [11], however doses of SP600125 greater than 10 μM were
able to increase alkaline phosphatase activity by up to 6-fold (Fig. 1A).
SP600125 decreased cell viability at concentrations above 10 μM. Aliza-
rin red staining showed matrix mineralization with high concentrations
of the SP600125 compound at all time points in the presence of rhBMP-2
(Fig. 1B), suggesting that JNK inhibition did not negatively affect termi-
nal differentiation and matrix production.

Matsuguchi et al. suggested that JNK inhibition could affect the func-
tion and/or terminal differentiation of osteoblasts [16]. The effects of
SP600125 on early versus late osteogenic differentiation were examined
by comparing SP600125 dosing on untreated C2C12 progenitors with

C2C12s that had been pre-differentiated using rhBMP-2. Contrary to
previous ﬁndings, both early and late rhBMP-2 treated cells showed in-
creased ALP activity with SP600125 (Fig. 2), suggesting that JNK inhibi-
tion promotes and does not prevent osteogenesis in culture.

Increased rhBMP-2 induced JNK activity in Nf1+/− BMSCs can be rescued
with SP600125

To test the hypothesis of increased JNK signaling with NF1-deﬁciency,
growth factor induced signaling was stimulated by 30 min of treatment
with 200 ng/ml rhBMP-2. This was shown to activate Ras as measured
by pull down assay in wild type BMSCs, but Ras activity was found to al-
ready be maximally stimulated and not further increased by rhBMP-2 in
Nf1+/− BMSCs (Fig. 3).

markers, suggesting rhBMP-2 alone was capable of maximal osteo-
genic stimulation. The late marker Ocn was reduced by the combina-
tion in wild type cells.
in Nf1-deﬁcient cells the
combination of rhBMP-2 and SP600125 led to the maximal expres-
sion of early and late osteogenic gene markers (Fig. 6).

In contrast,

Total c-Jun is increased in Nf1null calvarial cells

To examine whether the effects of total NF1 ablation on c-Jun phos-
phorylation were more severe an alternative model was used where
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox calvarial cells are transduced with an Adeno-cre virus to pro-
duce Nf1null osteoblasts. As previously described, western blots were
performed to examine the activation and total protein of c-Jun and
ERK and the results analyzed quantitatively. From densitometry read-
ings, it was calculated that Nf1null osteoblasts had a 4-fold increase in
total c-Jun and a 0.5-fold reduction in total ERK, normalized to Gapdh
(Fig. 8). Relative kinase phosphorylation was unchanged, but due to in-
creases in total ERK and c-Jun, phospho-ERK and phospho-c-Jun were
both elevated in Nf1null osteoblasts. These increases were seen in both
basal and rhBMP-2 induced samples compared to Adeno-GFP treated
control cells with normal NF1 function.

Pre-treatment with SP600125 reduced phospho-c-Jun levels in
Nf1null calvarial cells by approximately 2-fold, to levels not signiﬁ-
cantly different from Adeno-GFP treated control cells.

JNK inhibitor induces osteogenesis in Nf1null calvarial cells

Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox calvarial cultures were again treated with Adeno-Cre
virus to induce an Nf1null genotype in vitro to examine markers of os-
teoblast differentiation and function. Following transduction the cells
were treated with rhBMP-2 and/or SP600125 for 10 days with miner-
alization measured at day 14.

RhBMP-2 alone was not sufﬁcient to induce osteogenesis in GFP
control or Nf1-null cells. RhBMP-2 and SP600125 acted synergistically
to increase matrix mineralization in GFP-control cells (Fig. 7), while
combined use of these compounds was required to induce minerali-
zation in Nf1null cells.

Discussion

For NF1 patients, deﬁcient bone healing and the recalcitrance of
pseudarthrosis to standard interventions remain a signiﬁcant treatment
challenge. The underlying cellular causes of poor bone healing remain
unclear, however it is likely that NF1 can affect changes in osteoblast,
osteoclast, ﬁbroblast, and/or vascular cell proliferation, differentiation,
and function [18]. The molecular basis of these cellular changes has
been attributed to excessive Ras signaling in NF1-deﬁcient cells. How-
ever, increased Ras activity can inﬂuence different cell types in different
ways such as impairing pre-osteoblast differentiation [2,19], augment-
ing mature osteoblast function [20], and increasing the sensitivity of he-
matopoietic progenitors to pro-osteoclastic signals [2]. While canonical
Ras-MAPK signaling has repeatedly been shown to be upregulated in
NF1-deﬁcient cells [5,19,21–25], the role of other non-canonical path-
ways is less well understood. A Ras-PI3K-MAPK axis and subsequently
a role for Rac signaling have been shown to be important in mediating
the effects on osteoclast differentiation [2,26]. The implication of a JNK
signaling axis in Nf1+/− microglia led us to investigate the role of this
pathway in bone cell differentiation [8].

Based on the microglial studies, we hypothesized that JNK signal-
ing could be similarly increased in NF1-deﬁcient osteoprogenitors.
While both wild type and Nf1+/− BMSCs responded to rhBMP2 by in-
creasing activity of the canonical Ras-ERK pathway [27], only the
Nf1+/− BMSCs exhibited signiﬁcantly increased c-Jun phosphoryla-
tion. In Nf1null cells the total c-Jun levels were increased, resulting in
an absolute increase in c-Jun phosphorylation, although the ratio of
phospho-c-Jun to total c-Jun remained constant. The signiﬁcance of

Fig. 4. MAPK pathway activation in wild-type (Nf1+/+) and Nf1+/− BMSCs treated with
SP600125 (10 μM) and BMP2 (200 ng/ml).

Ras downstream signaling factors, including the MAPK pathway,
have been previously reported to be stimulated by rhBMP-2 [17], and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was dramatically elevated following rhBMP-2
treatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, phospho-c-Jun (a marker of JNK activity)
was relatively unaffected in wild type cells following rhBMP-2 treat-
ment. However, in Nf1+/− cells, rhBMP-2 led to a rapid activation of
phospho-c-Jun. Based on densitometry outcomes, phospho-c-Jun was
increased by 5-fold in Nf1+/− cells.

Pre-treatment of samples with 10 μM SP600125 for 1 h prior to
rhBMP-2 activation prevented the over-activation of phospho-c-Jun in
Nf1+/− BMSCs. In both wild type cells and Nf1+/− cells, ERK1/2 activity
was not affected. Overall levels of total ERK and c-Jun were not signiﬁ-
cantly different between the wild type cells and Nf1+/− BMSCs.

JNK inhibition increases osteogenesis in Nf1+/− BMSCs

Unlike C2C12s, BMSCs are able to undergo osteogenic differentiation
in media supplemented with ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate in
the absence rhBMP-2. Wild-type and Nf1+/− BMSCs were cultured for
a period of 14 days with rhBMP-2 and/or SP600125. Individually,
rhBMP-2 and SP600125 increased the production of the early bone
marker ALP in both wild-type and NF1-deﬁcient cells. When used in
combination these compounds further increased ALP production
(Fig. 5).

Gene expression of early markers of osteogenesis (Alp and Osx)
and a late marker (Ocn) were examined at day 7 and day 14 post-
treatment respectively. Treatment with either SP600125 or rhBMP-2
alone was sufﬁcient to increase all three markers (Fig. 6). The re-
sponse of Nf1-deﬁcient cells to rhBMP-2 was reduced compared to
wild type cells for all markers. For control wild type cells, the combi-
nation of rhBMP-2 and SP600125 had no beneﬁcial effect on early

this apparent mechanistic difference between Nf1+/− and Nf1null cells
is unclear.

Next, we hypothesized that excessive JNK signaling may contribute
to the capacity of NF1-deﬁcient progenitors to undergo normal osteo-
genic differentiation. Cultured cells from mice featuring NF1-deﬁciency
and knockout conﬁrmed prior ﬁndings that NF1 has a key role in osteo-
blast differentiation [3], and the effects of NF1 deﬁciency could be res-
cued using SP600125 treatment. Functional and molecular studies
showed augmentation of both early- and late- markers of osteogenesis.
The speciﬁcity of the inhibitor was validated by no change in phospho-
ERK1/2 with 10 μM SP600125.

Notably, work with cultured C2C12 myoblasts and wild-type pri-
mary BMSCs showed SP600125 treatment could increase osteogenic
markers in the absence of any NF1 deﬁciency. We hypothesized that
JNK may be important in osteogenic commitment and thus examined
uncommitted osteoprogenitors. When inhibition with SP600125 was
delayed until after osteogenic commitment, there was a blunting of
the positive effects seen with early dosing, but the overall effect on
osteogenesis remained positive. These data directly contradict the re-
sults of Matsuguchi et al. and Liu et al., who recently reported that
SP600125 decreased osteogenic potential in MC3T3-E1 cells [16,28].
It is difﬁcult to reconcile the ﬁndings of this study with those of Mat-
suguchi and Liu, although one potential explanation was their use of
MC3T3-E1 cells of unreported passage number; MC3T3-E1 cells can
show reduced BMP-responsiveness at higher passages [29]. Further
work with animal models will be required to resolve the in vivo ef-
fects of JNK inhibition on bone.

The skeletal defects associated with NF1-deﬁciency are potentially
caused by a combination of complete knockout of NF1 in cells and
NF1-deﬁcient cells. Nf1null cells have been identiﬁed in pseudarthrotic

tissue of NF1 patients [30], however their role in the development of
congenital tibial dysplasia remains unclear as they have not been
identiﬁed in all focal skeletal defects associated with NF1. We have
previously shown these cells to be less responsive to bone-inducing
signals than both wild-type and Nf1+/− cells (El-Hoss et al.,
in
press). Nf1null calvarial osteoblasts isolated and grown in vitro were
found to have increased total c-Jun protein and overall c-Jun activa-
tion, although no spike in JNK activity was seen in direct response
to rhBMP-2 (unlike the Nf1+/− BMSCs).

In conclusion, these experiments present new evidence for the
activation of the Ras-JNK pathway in NF1-deﬁcient osteoblasts. The
Ras-MAPK pathway has been historically cited as the mechanism un-
derlying deﬁcient NF1 osteogenesis, however it is possible that other
kinases downstream of Ras, such as JNK, may also mediate the bone
phenotype. Further experiments will be required to validate the in
vivo utility of JNK-based approaches for intervention in bone healing
in NF1.
