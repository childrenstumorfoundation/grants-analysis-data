ABSTRACT
Background. Schwannomatosis is a recently recognized
form of neurofibromatosis characterized by multiple non-
cutaneous schwannomas, a histologically benign nerve
sheath tumor. As more cases are identified, the reported
phenotype continues to expand and evolve. We describe the
spectrum of clinical findings in a cohort of patients meeting
established criteria for schwannomatosis.

Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical re-
cords of patients seen at our institution from 1995–2011
who fulfilled either research or clinical criteria for schwan-
nomatosis. Clinical, radiographic, and pathologic data
were extracted with attention to age at onset, location of tu-
mors, ophthalmologic evaluation, family history, and other
stigmata of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) or NF2.

Results. Eighty-seven patients met the criteria for the
study. The most common presentation was pain unasso-
ciated with a mass (46%). Seventy-seven of 87 (89%) pa-
tients had peripheral schwannomas, 49 of 66 (74%) had

spinal schwannomas, seven of 77 (9%) had nonvestibu-
lar intracranial schwannomas, and four of 77 (5%) had
intracranial meningiomas. Three patients were initially
diagnosed with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mor; however, following pathologic review, the diagno-
ses were revised in all three cases. Chronic pain was the
most common symptom (68%) and usually persisted de-
spite aggressive surgical and medical management.
Other common diagnoses included headaches, depres-
sion, and anxiety.

Conclusions. Peripheral and spinal schwannomas are
common in schwannomatosis patients. Severe pain is diffi-
cult to treat in these patients and often associated with anx-
iety and depression. These findings support a proactive
surveillance plan to identify tumors by magnetic resonance
imaging scan in order to optimize surgical treatment and to
treat associated pain, anxiety, and depression. The Oncolo-

INTRODUCTION
Schwannomatosis is the third major form of neurofibromato-
sis, a group of neurogenetic disorders that share a predisposi-
tion to multiple nerve sheath tumors. The condition was
initially thought to represent a mild form of neurofibromatosis
2 (NF2) because early series included patients with multiple
peripheral schwannomas [1]. Research criteria for schwanno-
matosis were proposed in 1997 [2], and by 2003, it was clear
that schwannomatosis was clinically and genetically distinct
from NF2 [3]. In 2005, consensus diagnostic criteria for

schwannomatosis were adopted for clinical use [4, 5], and
these were modified the following year to specifically exclude
patients who fulfilled the NF2 diagnostic criteria— bilateral
vestibular schwannomas on high-quality magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), first-degree relative with NF2, or a known
constitutional NF2 mutation [5].

Schwannomatosis is uncommon, with an annual incidence
of 0.58 cases per 1,000,000 persons [6]. As more cases are
identified, the reported phenotype continues to expand and
evolve. For example, recent case reports indicate that menin-

giomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs) occur in the setting of schwannomatosis [7–10].
Reports on clinical findings in large cohorts of patients with
long follow-up are therefore essential for our understanding of
the disease phenotype. In this report, we describe the spectrum
of clinical findings in 87 patients meeting the criteria for
schwannomatosis in a tertiary neurofibromatosis clinic.

METHODS
The clinical records of patients seen at The Family Center for
Neurofibromatosis at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
in 1995–2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who ful-
filled either the research criteria (used prior to 2005) [1], con-
sensus diagnostic criteria [4], or modified diagnostic criteria
[5] for schwannomatosis (Table 1) were included in the study.
Clinical, radiographic, and pathologic data were extracted
from clinical records with specific attention to age at onset, lo-
cation of tumors, ophthalmologic evaluation, family history,
and other stigmata of NF1 or NF2. All patients were examined
by a neurologist in the neurofibromatosis clinic at MGH. This
retrospective study was approved by the Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital institutional review board.

RESULTS
Diagnostic and Research Criteria
Eighty-seven patients who met either the research or diagnos-
tic criteria for schwannomatosis were identified. Sixty patients

(69%) met the research criteria for definite, presumptive, or
probable schwannomatosis; 27 did not meet the research cri-
teria based on having only one pathologically proven schwan-
noma. Eighty patients (92%) met the criteria for presumptive
or definite schwannomatosis based on the consensus diagnos-
tic criteria. Seven patients did not meet the consensus diagnos-
tic criteria as a result of a lack of high-quality MRI scan in a
patient aged ⬍45 years. Sixty-six patients (76%) met the more
restrictive modified diagnostic criteria; 21 patients did not
meet the modified criteria as a result of a lack of an internal
auditory canal protocol on MRI scan. None of the 87 patients
met the diagnostic criteria for NF1 or NF2.

Patient Characteristics
Of the 87 patients meeting the research or diagnostic criteria,
46 (53%) were female. The median age at initial symptom was
30 years (range, 8 –59 years). The median age at diagnosis was
40 years (range, 16 –70 years), with a median delay from initial
symptom to diagnosis of 7 years (range, 0 –39 years). A family
history of schwannomatosis was present in 11 individuals
(13%) from seven different families. Fifty patients (57%) ini-
tially presented with pain, including 40 (46%) unassociated
with a mass and 10 (11%) associated with a mass. Thirty-six
patients (41%) presented with a mass, including 24 (27%) with
a painless mass, 10 with a painful mass (11%), and two (2%)
whose tumor was found incidentally during other imaging.
Nine patients (10%) experienced other symptoms, such as

numbness or weakness. In four patients (5%), the presenting
symptoms were unknown.

Nervous System Tumors
Among 77 patients with cranial imaging, seven nonvestibular
cranial schwannomas were identified in seven patients (8%)
and five meningiomas were identified in four patients (5%). In
contrast to NF2, no vestibular schwannomas were identified.
Among 66 individuals with spinal imaging, spinal schwanno-
mas were common (74%, 49 of 66). Spinal tumors were most
common in the lumbar spine (53%, 35 of 66), followed by the
thoracic spine (35%, 23 of 66), and cervical spine (23%, 15 of
66). Spinal tumors were most commonly localized to a single
area of the spine (59%, 29 of 49), but in some patients they
involved two areas (33%, 16 of 49) or the entire spine (8%,
four of 49). In contrast to NF2, no intramedullary tumors sug-
gestive of ependymoma were noted.

Peripheral schwannomas were present in most patients
(89%, 77 of 87 patients), with the arms and legs being the most
commonly affected sites (46% and 45%, respectively), fol-
lowed by the head or neck (29%, 25 of 87), chest (16%, 14 of
87), pelvis (15%, 13 of 87), and abdomen (9%, eight of 87).
Anatomically limited disease, defined as multiple schwanno-
mas limited to a single limb or two spinal segments (Table 1),
was present in 26 (30%) patients. The location of segmental
involvement included the leg (35%), arm (23%), spine (23%),
and other (19%, e.g., the pelvis).

Other Clinical Manifestations
Subcutaneous masses (presumed tumors) were identified by
clinical examination in 23% of patients (20 of 87), with most
presenting with one to five masses. In addition to schwanno-
mas, pathologically proven lipomas were excised from 11
(13%) patients, angiolipomas were excised from three (3%)
patients, and cutaneous neurofibromas were excised from two
(2%) patients. Ophthalmologic abnormalities were present in a
minority of patients who had formal examinations (18%, seven
of 39) and included single cases of visual field defect, Addis
pupil, red– green color blindness, unilateral juvenile cataract,
amblyopia, indistinct hyperpigmentation, and undefined oph-
thalmologic stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Twenty patients
(23%) had at least one café-au-lait macule that was ⬎1.5 cm in
size; no patient had more than four. No skinfold freckling was
seen in these patients. Four patients had a history of learning
disability (5%), five (6%) had an existing diagnosis of scolio-
sis, and 14 (16%) reported tinnitus.

Surgical Management
Eighty-six patients underwent 217 surgeries for schwannoma
resection (median number of surgeries per patient, 2; range,
1–9). Forty patients underwent a total of 72 spinal surgeries,
including 20 on the cervical spine (28%), 11 on the thoracic
spine (15%), 30 on the lumbosacral spine (42%), and 11 on
more than one spinal section (15%). Almost half of the patients
(18 of 40, 45%) experienced persistent postoperative deficits,
including sensory abnormalities in 13 patients, weakness in
four patients, painful kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis in three pa-

www.TheOncologist.com

tients, and bladder dysfunction in three patients. Seventy pa-
tients underwent 145 peripheral surgeries in locations
spanning the entire body. Nineteen patients (27%, 19 of 70)
had persistent postoperative deficits, including sensory abnor-
malities in 12 patients, weakness in five patients, and bladder
dysfunction in one patient.

Prevalence and Management of Pain
The most common symptom reported by schwannomatosis pa-
tients was chronic pain (68%, 59 of 87 patients), which in-
cluded both local and multifocal or diffuse pain. Sixteen
patients (18%) were disabled by their pain and either had to
take extended medical leave from work or were unable to
work. Accordingly, pain was the indication for surgery in most
patients (80%, 70 of 87) and for most surgeries (80%, 145 of 181)
for which an indication for surgery was documented. Local pain
was completely relieved in less than half of the surgeries (39%, 57
of 145) and recurred in most patients (75%, 43 of 57), either at the
site of the original tumor or as a result of a new tumor. Local pain
was partially relieved after 20 of 145 (14%) surgeries and was un-
changed after 41 of 145 (28%) surgeries. The outcome on local
pain relief was unknown for 27 of 145 (19%) surgeries.

Most patients (62%, 54 of 87) reported the use of medica-
tions for chronic pain at some point in their care. The median
number of pain medications trialed was three (range, 1–15),
with 72% of patients (39 of 54) reporting use of five or fewer
medications, 20% of patients (11 of 54) reporting six to ten med-
ications, and 7% of patients (four of 54) reporting ⬎10 medica-
tions. An equal number of patients reported the use of
neuropathic, opiate, and anti-inflammatory medications (63%,
34 of 54), most commonly gabapentin (24 of 54), oxycodone
formulations (23 of 54), and amitriptyline (20 of 54). A minor-
ity of patients were treated with muscle relaxants (17%, nine of
54) or various other medications, including the lidocaine patch
(19%, 10 of 54). Patients used a median of two concurrent
medications (range, 1– 6) for pain management. Other meth-
ods of pain control included spinal block (five patients), radio-
frequency lesioning (two patients), and a transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulator unit (one patient). No patients were
treated with chemotherapy.

Comorbid Conditions
Eleven patients (12.6%) were diagnosed with 16 malignancies.
At initial pathologic review, three patients were diagnosed
with MPNST and one patient was diagnosed with spindle cell
carcinoma. Upon further review by one author with expertise
in NF-related pathology (A.S.R.), the pathologic diagnosis
was revised in all four cases. Two cases of MPNST were re-
classified as cellular schwannomas based on their histological
features and their diffuse, marked expression of S100 and p16
proteins on immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B–D), one case of
MPNST was reclassified as melanoma based on the presence
of a characteristic BRAFV600E mutation (that was also present
in a coexistent primary skin melanoma), and one case of spin-
dle cell carcinoma was not available for review but was pre-
sumed to be schwannoma based on the long survival of the
patient after diagnosis (⬎35 years). The remaining malignan-

cies included seven skin cancers (four basal cell carcinomas,
two squamous cell carcinomas, and one melanoma), two pap-
illary thyroid carcinomas, two breast cancers (one ductal car-
cinoma and one of unknown type), and one lung
adenocarcinoma.

Fifty-two patients (60%) had cysts diagnosed clinically,
pathologically, or radiographically. Fifteen patients (17.2%)
had visceral cysts, including renal cysts (n ⫽ 14), hepatic cysts
(n ⫽ 3), and a pancreatic cyst (n ⫽ 1). Thirteen of 46 women in
the study (28%) had cysts in the ovaries and/or fallopian tubes.
Other common cysts included mucus retention cysts in the
maxillary sinuses; Baker’s, subchondral, and synovial cysts in
the joints; and epidermal cysts on the skin.

Twenty-six patients (30%) received clinical diagnoses of
depression, including 18 of 46 women (39%) and seven of 41
men (17%). Eighteen patients (20%) reported migraines or fre-
quent headaches, including 13 of 46 women (28%) and five of
41 men (12%). Eleven patients (13%) had diagnoses of hypo-
thyroidism and were receiving levothyroxine. Of these, 10 of
46 (22%) were women and one of 41 (2%) was male.

DISCUSSION
One of the main challenges in diagnosing schwannomatosis is
to differentiate it from NF2 or NF1. Although none of the pa-
tients in our cohort simultaneously met the diagnostic criteria
for NF1 or for NF2, careful attention to other clinical manifes-
tations remains essential in establishing the correct diagnosis.
Some NF2 patients may present with multiple peripheral
schwannomas [11], making it critical to screen all suspected

schwannomatosis patients for NF2. Schwannomatosis is char-
acterized by the presence of multiple nonvestibular, nonintra-
dermal schwannomas, whereas the hallmark of NF2 is the
presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The consensus
diagnostic criteria and the revised diagnostic criteria address
this issue by requiring cranial MRI scans to exclude vestibular
schwannomas. However, a recent report from the Manchester
group suggests that schwannomatosis patients may, in fact, de-
velop unilateral vestibular schwannomas [12], further blurring
the distinction between these two conditions. To date, neither
cataracts, epiretinal membranes, nor spinal ependymoma have
been described at a higher frequency in schwannomatosis pa-
tients. Similarly, schwannomatosis must be differentiated
from NF1. A lack of cardinal features of NF1—skinfold freck-
ling, greater than six café-au-lait macules, multiple cutaneous
nerve sheath tumors, and Lisch nodules—is helpful in exclud-
ing a diagnosis of NF1 in these patients. Importantly, the
presence of an intracranial meningioma or a cutaneous neuro-
fibroma does not exclude a diagnosis of schwannomatosis.

This retrospective review of 87 patients describes the larg-
est cohort of schwannomatosis patients to date and provides a
comprehensive view of the disease phenotype. Our results ex-
tend previous findings in smaller case series [4, 8] and docu-
ment the common and uncommon features associated with
schwannomatosis. In our series, the high rates of peripheral
schwannomas (89% of patients) and spinal schwannomas
(74%) support a proactive surveillance plan for schwannoma-
tosis patients in which neurological symptoms and signs are
investigated using MRI to identify tumors. These studies can

distinguish between schwannoma-related pain and other com-
mon causes of pain that are not related to tumors (e.g., degen-
erative disc disease, arthritis, or plantar fasciitis). Follow-up
MRI scans can be performed periodically based on clinical
symptoms to monitor for the appearance of new tumors,
changes in tumor size, and involvement of nearby structures.
In accordance with previous reports, the rate of anatomi-
cally limited disease was 30% [4]. However, because patients
in this study did not receive whole-body MRI scans, asymp-
tomatic tumors in other body regions might have been missed
by regional MRI. Despite the high prevalence of schwanno-
mas, the median delay in diagnosis was 7 years in our popula-
tion, indicating the need for earlier recognition of symptoms.
Other clinical features associated with NF2 were also pres-
ent in our patients. Intracranial meningiomas were identified in
5% of our cohort, as compared with an expected prevalence of
⬃50% in NF2 patients [13]. These tumors usually occurred as
solitary tumors in schwannomatosis patients, whereas they are of-
ten multiple or confluent in NF2 patients. The presence of a me-
ningioma in a schwannomatosis patient was noted in early patient
series [3, 14], and recently multigenerational families with menin-
giomas and germline SMARCB1 mutations have been described
[9, 10]. Other tumors common in NF2—spinal meningiomas and
ependymomas—were not found in this series. Finally, there was
no common ophthalmologic pathology in schwannomatosis pa-
tients. This finding contrasts with that for NF2 patients, in whom
cataracts are found in up to 80% of patients [15].

Chronic pain remains the hallmark of schwannomatosis.
The majority of our patients (68%) experienced chronic pain,
and a significant number were disabled by their pain. Despite
aggressive management with surgery (99%) and pain medica-
tion (62%), most patients did not become pain free. Further-
more, 20% of patients (28% of women and 12% of men)
experienced frequent headaches, which were often described
as “migraines.” Whether this reflects a misattribution of non-
specific pain from other body parts or a separate mechanism
remains unclear. Referral to an experienced pain clinic is war-
ranted for schwannomatosis patients with chronic pain.

Depression and anxiety are also common in schwannoma-
tosis patients, with 39% of women and 17% of men reporting a
history of these mood disorders. Survey data indicate that pa-
tients with schwannomatosis suffer impaired quality of life and
higher rates of depression than the normal population [16]. It is
likely that the stress of living with chronic pain, especially pain
that is often undiagnosed for years, leads to greater psychoso-
cial stress on these patients. Active surveillance for and treat-
ment of mood disorders is a central aspect of patient care, and
appropriate referrals to mind– body programs and psychiatric
treatment is warranted.

There is concern of a higher risk for malignancy in patients
with schwannomatosis, in particular for MPNSTs and atypical
teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), because these tumors
have been reported in patients with familial schwannomatosis
[7, 8]. In our cohort, three patients were diagnosed with
MPNST on initial pathologic review. All three diagnoses were
revised upon subsequent review, and during this process, we
identified features that may cause pathologic misdiagnosis of

www.TheOncologist.com

schwannomatosis-related schwannomas. In one cellular
schwannoma, morphological features of classic schwannoma
(such as Antoni A and Antoni B regions and Verocay bodies as
seen in Fig. 1A) were absent and dense cellularity and mitoses
were present (Fig. 1B). This schwannoma contained promi-
nent hyperchromatic, atypical nuclei resulting from ancient
change that was misinterpreted as early malignant transforma-
tion in a neurofibroma. A second schwannoma with prominent
myxoid background (myxoid schwannoma) was misdiagnosed
as a neurofibroma (Fig. 1C). This error led to a clinical diag-
nosis of NF1 rather than schwannomatosis in this patient, and
to misinterpretation of a subsequent specimen as malignant
transformation of a neurofibroma rather than schwannoma. In
both cases, diffuse expression of S100 protein on immunohis-
tochemistry was helpful in highlighting the monotonous pop-
ulation of neoplastic Schwann cells comprising the tumor (Fig.
1D). Because loss of expression of p16 is often associated with
early malignant transformation in neurofibromas, diffuse ex-
pression of p16 is also helpful in supporting the diagnosis of a
benign lesion in difficult cases. A third MPNST was reclassi-
fied as melanoma based on the presence of a characteristic
BRAF mutation that was also present in a pre-existing skin
melanoma from the same patient. Distinguishing metastatic
amelanotic melanoma from MPNST may be impossible based
on histology alone because the two tumors share similar histo-
logical and immunohistochemical features. However, newer
molecular analysis (e.g., the presence of characteristic BRAF
mutations) can help distinguish these two entities. Thus, in our
series of 87 schwannomatosis patients, none were diagnosed
with MPNST or AT/RT upon careful review. Our results sug-
gest that a diagnosis of MPNST in a schwannomatosis patient
should be viewed with caution because the pathological diag-
nosis in some of these cases may be challenging.

We identified clinical findings of indeterminate signifi-
cance in our patient population. For example, our cohort had
relatively high rates of lipomas, multiple angiolipomas, vis-
ceral cysts, orthopedic cysts, and ovarian cysts. It is unclear
whether this finding represents a predisposition to these types
of lesions or a high identification rate as a result of the aggres-
sive imaging and surgical approach used for schwannomatosis
patients. Similarly, it is unclear whether the high rate of hypo-
thyroidism in schwannomatosis patients (22%, versus 9% in
the general population) reflects a true association or an artifact
of additional testing performed in the course of medical care
[17]. Additional research with other cohorts of schwannoma-
tosis patients should help address these questions.

The main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature
and single-institution basis. Clinical information was incom-
plete for some patients, particularly those referred to our clinic
from distant locations, because these patients were most likely
to seek consultation and diagnosis only, rather than extensive
treatment and follow-up. A multicenter, prospective study is
needed to gather more comprehensive information that is tai-
lored to the clinical and research questions most pertinent to
schwannomatosis. The Children’s Tumor Foundation has
sponsored an international schwannomatosis database that
contains limited data on ⬎225 patients worldwide (Amanda

should help facilitate patient-based research on schwannoma-
tosis patients over the next decade.
