Summary

The transcription factor ATF4 enhances bone formation by favoring amino acid import and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts,
a function requiring its phosphorylation by RSK2, the kinase inactivated in Cofﬁn-Lowry Syndrome. Here, we show that in
contrast, RSK2 activity, ATF4-dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neuroﬁbro-

Introduction

The molecular elucidation of human skeletal dysplasiae has
greatly contributed to our current knowledge of skeletogenesis
(Olsen et al., 2000). Indeed, many of the transcription factors im-
plicated in this process such as Msx1, Sox9, Runx2, Twist-1 and
Atf4 are mutated or their activity is affected in several dysplasiae
(Bi et al., 2001; Bialek et al., 2004; Ducy et al., 1997; Satokata
and Maas, 1994; Wagner et al., 1994; Yang et al., 2004). Con-
versely,
the identiﬁcation through molecular means and/or
mouse genetics of transcription factors regulating chondrocyte
and osteoblast differentiation led, in few cases, to a better mo-
lecular understanding of the pathogenesis of human skeletal
dysplasiae. A potential
implication of these advances is that
one could propose and test, at least in mice, adapted therapies
for some of these diseases based on the knowledge of the mo-
lecular mode of action of these transcription factors.

In the vast majority of cases, however, molecular elucidation
of skeletal dysplasiae has not led yet to a better understanding
of the disease or to a more rational treatment. Neuroﬁbromato-
sis type I (NF1), a disease caused by loss of function mutations
in NF1, a gene encoding the Ras GAP (GTPase Activating
Protein) neuroﬁbromin (Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2003; Klose
et al., 1998; Parada, 2000) belongs to this latter category. In-
deed, besides well-described tumors of the nervous system,
NF1 patients often display well-documented skeletal abnormal-
ities whose cellular and molecular pathogenesis is not fully elu-
cidated, in part because no animal model has been available to

study them (Alwan et al., 2005; Jacquemin et al., 2003; Kuori-
lehto et al., 2004, 2005; Kwok et al., 2002; Ruggieri et al.,
1999; Sigillo et al., 2002; Simsek et al., 2003; Stevenson et al.,
1999). As a result of the paucity of molecular knowledge of
how neuroﬁbromin affects bone biology the only available treat-
ment for these often debilitating manifestations remains surgery.
ATF4, an osteoblast-enriched member of the CREB family of
transcription factors, is necessary for the latest phases of oste-
oblast differentiation, for extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis by
osteoblasts, i.e., bone formation, and for osteoclast differentia-
tion (Elefteriou et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2004). These different
functions require phosphorylation of ATF4 by distinct kinases.
RSK2, the kinase mutated in Cofﬁn-Lowry syndrome (CLS), reg-
ulates the ﬁrst two activities of ATF4 while PKA regulates its third
function. Remarkably, ATF4 favors bone formation through two
distinct mechanisms, both of which depend on its phosphoryla-
tion by RSK2. On the one hand, it positively regulates osteo-
blast-speciﬁc genes at the transcriptional level, and on the other
hand, it promotes synthesis of Type I collagen, the main compo-
nent of the bone ECM, by favoring amino acid import (Yang
et al., 2004). In that respect the fact that the skeletal manifesta-
tions of CLS worsen overtime (Hunter, 2002; Touraine et al.,
2002) raises the hypothesis that it may be due, primarily, to
a lack of collagen synthesis during skeletal growth. This hypoth-
esis is testable using mouse models. In any case the central role
played by ATF4 in regulating osteoblasts main functions sug-
gests that it may be implicated in the development of additional
bone diseases beside CLS.

In the present study, we generated mice lacking Nf1 only in
2/2 mice) with the primary goal to elucidate
osteoblasts (Nf1ob
the transcriptional events accounting for NF1 skeletal manifes-
tations. This conditional deletion bypasses the embryonic lethal-
ity of a somatic deletion of the gene allowing us to analyze the
function of Nf1 in bone (Zhu et al., 2001). Through molecular
and genetic analyses of this mouse model we demonstrate
here that ATF4 plays a crucial role in mediating neuroﬁbromin
signaling in osteoblasts. Surprisingly, further use of this mouse
model and of Atf42/2 and Rsk22/2 mice led to the conclusion
that, at least in mice, one can reverse and even prevent skeletal
manifestations that are secondary to abnormal phosphorylation
of ATF4 by RSK2 through simple dietary manipulations. Thus,
these results not only provide a molecular basis for NF skeletal
manifestations but also identify a hitherto unanticipated connec-
tion between amino acid intake and skeletal development.

2/2 mice

Multiple bone phenotypes in Nf1ob
To identify molecular events accounting for NF skeletal manifes-
tations we studied neuroﬁbromin functions in osteoblast, the
bone cell type where Nf1 is expressed at the highest level (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B). Because Nf1-deﬁcient embryos die before
skeletogenesis is initiated (Jacks et al., 1994) and Nf1+/2 mice
do not display any appreciable bone abnormalities (Yu et al.,
2005), we generated a mutant mouse strain lacking Nf1 only in
2/2 mice) by crossing mice harboring a ﬂoxed
osteoblasts (Nf1ob
allele of Nf1 (Zhu et al., 2001) with mice expressing Cre recom-
binase speciﬁcally in osteoblasts beyond E14.5 (a1(I) Collagen
Cre transgenic mice) (Dacquin et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2001). Ex-
cision at the Nf1 locus exceeded 90% in primary osteoblast
2/2 mice while no exci-
culture originating from 4-day-old Nf1ob
sion could be detected in any other cell type tested including
osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells (Figure 1C).

Nf1ob

2/2 mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, did
not display any skeletal patterning abnormalities and had a nor-
mal life span (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with
this article online, and data not shown). Histological and 3D
microtomography analyses performed on vertebrae and long
2/2 mice at 2, 3, and 6 months
bones of male and female Nf1ob
of age showed a progressive increase in bone volume, i.e.,
a high bone mass phenotype (Figures 1D and 1E, S1C, and
data not shown). Static and dynamic histomorphometric analy-
ses revealed a marked increase in osteoblast surface and num-
ber and in the bone formation rate (Figure 1D) indicating that this
high bone mass phenotype was secondary to an increase in
bone formation.

This histomorphometric analysis also uncovered two other
2/2 mice. The ﬁrst
and unanticipated abnormalities in Nf1ob
one was, in all mutant bones analyzed, a signiﬁcant increase
in osteoid volume, i.e., in the amount of bone ECM that is not

2/2 mice displayed an in-

creased bone resorption characterized by an increase in the
number of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive
multinucleated osteoclasts, and in urinary elimination of deoxy-
piridinoline (Dpd), a biomarker of osteoclasts activity (Figure 1G).
A similar increase in Dpd urinary elimination has been reported
2/2
in NF1 patients, underscoring the relevance of the Nf1ob
mice as a model of NF1 bone disease (Stevenson et al., 2005).
Consistent with the osteoblast-speciﬁc gene inactivation per-
formed, coculture of Nf12/2 osteoblasts with bone marrow mac-

rophages (BMMs), originated from either WT or Nf1ob
yielded a signiﬁcantly higher number of multinucleated differen-
tiated osteoclasts than identical cocultures of BMMs (of either
genotypes) with WT osteoblasts (Figure 1H). Despite the role
of Nf1 signaling in osteoblast-dependent osteoclast differentia-
tion, vitamin D was still required for osteoclast differentiation in
this ex vivo assay. In addition, spleen cells isolated from WT or
Nf1ob
into multinucleated
osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and m-CSF excluding
2/2 mice
an autonomous defect
(Figure 1I). Thus Nf1 inactivation in osteoblasts affects osteo-
clast differentiation in addition to bone formation.

Molecular bases of the increased osteoid volume
in Nf1ob
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby neuroﬁbromin
deletion in osteoblasts affects altogether bone formation, bone
resorption and ECM mineralization, we used this latter pheno-
type as an entry point. Type I Collagen and tissue nonspeciﬁc al-
kaline phosphatase (Tnap), which are together necessary and
sufﬁcient to induce bone ECM mineralization in mice, were nor-
2/2 mice as were Runx2, Osterix and
mally expressed in Nf1ob
Atf4 mRNA, the three main transcription factors governing oste-
oblast differentiation (Stein et al., 1996; Murshed et al., 2005;
Wagner and Karsenty, 2001; Yang et al., 2004) (Figures 1J and
1K). The only molecular abnormality observed in Nf12/2 osteo-
blasts was an increase in the expression of Osteocalcin, a gene
whose inactivation or overexpression in osteoblasts does not af-
fect ECM mineralization (Ducy et al., 1996; Murshed et al., 2004).
Furthermore, there was no overt abnormality of calcium and
phosphate metabolism that could explain this defect in ECM
mineralization (Figure S2). Taken together, these data ruled
2/2 mice
out that the increase in osteoid thickness in Nf1ob
was due to an abnormal expression of genes involved in osteo-
blast differentiation or ECM mineralization.

We also asked whether the ECM mineralization abnormality
2/2 mice could be secondary to posttranscrip-
observed in Nf1ob
tional events. To that end we measured Type I collagen produc-
2/2 bones and osteo-
tion and TNAP activity in WT and Nf1ob
blasts. Bone collagen content, as assessed by total trabecular

thickness and by Western blot was increased in Nf1ob
and osteoblasts compared to WT controls (Figures 1F and 1L).

In contrast, TNAP activity was normal in Nf12/2 osteoblasts as
2/2 mice (Figure 1M). This in-
was TNAP serum levels in Nf1ob
crease in collagen secretion was not observed in osteoblasts
isolated from another mouse model characterized by an in-
creased osteoid thickness such as the Hyp mice (Eicher et al.,
1976) indicating that it was a speciﬁc consequence of Nf1 dele-
tion in osteoblasts (Figure 1L). Lastly, mineralization lag time,
i.e., the time period between collagen synthesis and the initia-
2/2 mice, suggest-
tion of mineralization, was increased in Nf1ob
ing the existence of an additional function of Nf1 in bone
mineralization (Figure 1F). Taken together, these observations
indicated that a posttranscriptional increase in collagen synthe-
sis as well as an increase in osteoblast number along with a
delay in mineralization contributed to the increase in osteoid
amount in Nf1ob

2/2 mice.

ATF4 mediates neuroﬁbromin signaling in osteoblasts
The increase in collagen content in the face of a normal expres-
sion of Type I collagen along with the increase in Osteocalcin ex-
pression is the mirror image of what is seen in mice lacking Atf4.
ATF4 is an osteoblast-enriched member of the CREB family of
transcription factors regulating Osteocalcin expression, osteo-
clast differentiation and Type I collagen synthesis via its ability
to favor amino-acid import (Elefteriou et al., 2005; Harding
et al., 2000, 2003; Yang et al., 2004). This observation led us
to test whether an increase in ATF4 activity contributed to the
skeletal abnormalities in Nf1ob

2/2 mice.

To regulate Collagen synthesis and Osteocalcin expression
ATF4 must be phosphorylated at serine 251 by RSK2, a sub-
strate of the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Dalby et al.,
1998; Fisher and Blenis, 1996). Accordingly, RSK2 and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation were increased in Nf12/2 osteoblasts
and Ras activity was higher in Nf12/2 than in WT osteoblasts
(Figure 2A). These alterations were speciﬁc of the ERK pathway
as AKT and p38 phosphorylation was not affected in Nf12/2
osteoblasts. As expected the increase in RSK2 activation en-
hanced ATF4 phosphorylation at serine 251, conversely treat-
ment of Nf12/2 osteoblasts with the MEK inhibitor U0126
reduced 251S-ATF4 phosphorylation, leading to a reduction of
Osteocalcin expression (Figures 2A–2C). Likewise, treatment
2/2 mice with a MEK inhibitor for 5 weeks reduced col-
of Nf1ob
lagen synthesis and osteoid thickness without altering Type I
collagen mRNA levels and bone volume (Figures 2D and 2E
and data not shown). Taken together, these results established
that, in osteoblasts, neuroﬁbromin is a negative regulator of the
RSK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATF4, thereby a negative
regulator of Osteocalcin expression and of Type I collagen syn-
thesis, the most abundant protein component of the bone ECM.
On the other hand, to favor Rankl expression and osteoclast
differentiation, ATF4 must be phosphorylated by PKA on serine
254, which is a RSK2-independent event (Elefteriou et al., 2005).
PKA activity was increased in Nf12/2 compared to WT osteo-
blasts (Figure 2F), consequently ATF4 was more highly phos-
phorylated at serine 254 and Rankl expression was higher in
Nf12/2 than in WT osteoblasts, while expression of Opg, a decoy
receptor for RANKL, was unaffected (Figures 2G–2I). The PKA
inhibitor H89 blunted the increase in Rankl expression in
Nf12/2 osteoblasts further supporting the notion that neuroﬁ-
bromin-dependent PKA phosphorylation of ATF4 contributes
to the osteoblast-mediated increase in bone resorption ob-
served in Nf1ob

2/2 mice (Figure 2I).

2/2 mice

Genetic evidence of ATF4 involvement in Nf1ob
bone phenotypes
To provide further support to the notion that ATF4 mediates neu-
roﬁbromin signaling in osteoblasts we next used mouse models.
We ﬁrst constructed and analyzed transgenic mice overex-
pressing Atf4 speciﬁcally in osteoblasts (a1(I) Collagen-Atf4
mice) (Figures 3A and S3). a1(I) Collagen-Atf4 mice displayed
2/2 mice:
the same three bone phenotypes observed in Nf1ob
an increase in bone formation and bone mass, in bone resorp-
tion and in osteoid thickness (Figures 3B and 3D). At the molec-
ular level the similarities between the two models were also
striking and included an increase in Ocn and Rankl expression,
two target genes of ATF4, and an increase in collagen content
(but not its mRNA expression) in a1(I) Collagen-Atf4 mice (Fig-
ures 3E and 3F). The increase in Rankl expression explains the
increase in bone resorption observed in these transgenic mice
while the increase in collagen content together with an increase
in osteoblast number provides an explanation for their bone for-
mation and osteoid thickness abnormalities. This is consistent
with the known role of Atf4 as a regulator of osteoblast differen-
tiation and collagen synthesis (Yang et al., 2004).

Next we generated and analyzed Nf1ob

2/2 mice lacking one
allele of Atf4 or of Runx2 or Osterix, two other osteoblast-spe-
2/2;Atf4+/2
ciﬁc transcription factors. Six-month-old Nf1ob
mice displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in collagen synthesis
2/2 mice lacking one allele of
that was not observed in Nf1ob
either Runx2 or Osterix (Figure 3G). Accordingly, osteoid thick-
ness was decreased in Nf1ob
in
2/2;Osx+/2 mice (Figure 3H and
Nf1ob
data not shown). Taken together, these results provide genetic
support to the notion that ATF4 mediates neuroﬁbromin signal-
ing in osteoblasts.

Low-protein diet corrects Nf1ob
abnormalities
What could be the therapeutic implications of these molecular
ﬁndings? It is known that ATF4 promotes amino acid import
into cells by activating genes encoding membranes transporters
(Harding et al., 2003). Consequently, Atf42/2 osteoblasts are
subject to amino acid depletion, a phenotype corrected by
addition of nonessential amino acid to their culture medium
(Yang et al., 2004). Thus we asked whether the ATF4-mediated
increase in intracellular amino acid availability plays a role in the
development of bone abnormalities in Nf1ob

2/2 mice.

WT and Nf1ob

2/2 mice were fed with either a normal diet (ND)
or a LPD from birth to 4 months of age. To determine if the LPD
affected amino acid pools in bone cells, we measured the activ-
ity of GCN2, a kinase that is activated by uncharged transfer
RNAs and that phosphorylates serine 51 on the a subunit of
the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) resulting in reduced
translation initiation and reduced protein synthesis (Dong
et al., 2000; Harding et al., 2000). Levels of activated GCN2
and phosphorylated eIF2a were both increased in bones of
2/2 mice
LPD-fed WT mice but not in bones of LPD-fed Nf1ob
(Figure 4A). These observations suggested that dietary manipu-
lation can affect amino acid pools in bone cells and that, as pre-
2/2 mice. Accordingly,
dicted these pools are greater in Nf1ob
the amount of Type I collagen detectable by Western blot was
2/2 mice fed a LPD (Fig-
markedly decreased in bones of Nf1ob
ure 4B). Despite the fact that GCN2 remained inactive in mutant
mice, histomorphometric analyses showed that the high bone

the increase in PKA activity observed in Nf1-deﬁcient osteo-
blasts was not secondary to the increase in RSK2 activity
(Figure 4C). The LPD also normalized bone mass, osteoid thick-
ness and bone formation parameters in 2-month-old a1(I) Colla-

gen-Atf4 mice further demonstrating the involvement of ATF4 as
a mediator of neuroﬁbromin signaling in osteoblasts (Figure 4D).

High-protein diet corrects Rsk22/2 and Atf42/2 bone

The remarkable efﬁcacy of a LPD in rescuing skeletal manifesta-
tions of a disease caused by an increase in ATF4 activity sug-
gested that, conversely, a high-protein diet (HPD) could rescue
the skeletal manifestations observed in Rsk2-deﬁcient mice,
a mouse model of Cofﬁn-Lowry syndrome (CLS) characterized
by a decrease in ATF4 function.

2/2 bone phenotype

To test this hypothesis, Atf4+/2 and Rsk2+/2 mothers were
fed from the ﬁrst day of gestation with a ND, a high-fat diet
(HFD) or a HPD. After weaning, pups of each genotype were
kept on this same diet up to 28 days of age. As previously re-
ported (Tanaka et al., 1998), when Atf4+/2 mothers and Atf42/2
pups received a ND only 10% of the pups recovered at 1
month of age were Atf42/2. This perinatal lethality was not cor-
rected by a HFD (Figure 5A), in contrast, the proportion of 1-
month-old Atf42/2 mice alive doubled when Atf4+/2 mothers
and Atf42/2 pups were fed a HPD. This rescue was speciﬁc
of the Atf4 mutation since HPD did not affect the perinatal le-
thality of mice lacking Runx2 or Osterix, the two other osteo-
blast-speciﬁc transcription factors whose deletion prevents os-
teoblast differentiation (Komori et al., 1997; Nakashima et al.,
2002; Otto et al., 1997). That phosphorylation of GCN2 as
well as eIF2a was decreased in HPD-fed Atf4- and Rsk2-deﬁ-
cient bones suggested a state of amino acid sufﬁciency in mu-
tant osteoblasts (Figure 5B). In agreement with this assump-
tion, histomorphometric analyses showed that HPD, but not
HFD,
fully rescued the low bone formation and low bone
mass otherwise observed in 1-month-old Atf42/2 and
Rsk22/2 mice (Figures 5C and S5A) and normalized Type I col-
lagen synthesis in Atf42/2 and Rsk22/2 but not in WT bones
without affecting Type I collagen expression (Figure 5E). Return
to normal diet following 1 month of HPD reversed the HPD-
induced bone mass rescue observed in Atf42/2 mice (Fig-
ure 5C),
indicating that nutritional manipulations of ATF4’s
function are effective postnatally as well.

A surprising feature of Atf4- and Rsk2-deﬁcient mice fed
a HPD was the normalization of their osteoblasts number (Fig-
ure 5C). This suggested that this diet may have also rescued
the delay in osteoblast differentiation characterizing these mu-
tant embryos. To address this possibility, we analyzed Atf42/2
and Rsk22/2 embryos whose mothers were fed either a ND or
a HPD at the time osteoblast differentiation occurs. Molecular
analysis of E15.5 and E18.5 mutant embryos showed that feed-
ing pregnant mothers with HPD but not HFD sufﬁced to correct
the lack of bone trabeculae otherwise observed in Atf42/2 and
Rsk22/2 embryos (Figure 5D and S5B). This rescue was speciﬁc
of the RSK2-ATF4 pathway as the HPD did not correct the oste-
oblast differentiation defect observed in embryos lacking Runx2
or Osterix, two transcription factors not phosphorylated by
RSK2 (Yang et al., 2004) (Figure 5D). The restoration of the ex-
pression of Bone sialoprotein (Bsp) and Osteocalcin, two target
genes of ATF4, in E15.5 and E18.5 Atf42/2 embryos to levels
seen in WT embryos veriﬁed that osteoblast differentiation has
been rescued by the HPD (Figure 5F). Taken together, these re-
sults demonstrate that ATF4 regulation of osteoblast differenti-
ation and bone formation during development and postnatally
occurs mainly through its ability to favor amino acid import
and thereby protein synthesis.

Discussion

This study identiﬁes ATF4 as a crucial transcriptional mediator of
NF1 signaling in osteoblasts, the bone cells in which Nf1 is

expressed at the highest level and identiﬁes neuroﬁbromin as
a negative regulator of bone remodeling acting via distinct path-
ways on bone formation and bone resorption (Figure 6). More-
2/2 mice elicited by the knowledge
over, further use of Nf1ob
surrounding ATF4 molecular mode of action showed that
development of ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasiae can be
corrected by simple diet manipulations thus uncovering a novel
mechanism regulating skeletal development and suggesting
a simple treatment for a relatively frequent skeletal dysplasia.

A mouse model of NF1 skeletal manifestations
Pleiotropic skeletal manifestations ranging from bowing of long
bones to pseudoarthrosis are observed in a signiﬁcant portion of
NF1 patients. Remarkably, these manifestations often worsen
with age (Ruggieri et al., 1999; Hermanns-Sachweh et al.,
2005; Kuorilehto et al., 2004; Lammert et al., 2005). Little was
known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms account-
ing for NF1 skeletal manifestations since no animal model has
been available until now. Indeed, Nf12/2 mice die in utero before
+/2 mice, unlike human pa-
skeletogenesis is initiated and Nf1
tients, do not have any overt skeletal manifestations (Yu et al.,
2005). Thus, to elucidate the histological, cellular, and molecular
bases of NF1 skeletal manifestations, we generated mice lack-
ing NF1 only in the bone-speciﬁc cell in which Nf1 expression is
the highest, namely the osteoblast. We show here that in mice,

through expression in osteoblasts, Nf1 affects both bone forma-
tion and bone resorption. In addition, it also affects the overall
degree of mineralization of bone ECM. These results deﬁne an
animal model of NF1 skeletal manifestations that may contribute
to elucidate the pleiotropic nature of NF1 skeletal manifestations
in humans. They also uncovered a molecular mechanism of ac-
tion for neuroﬁbromin in osteoblasts.

ATF4, a trancriptional mediator of neuroﬁbromin
signaling in osteoblasts
2/2 mice
The only molecular abnormalities observed in Nf1ob
and bones were an increase in collagen synthesis and in Osteo-
calcin expression. Those features were the mirror image of what
was seen in mice lacking one of the major osteoblast-enriched
transcription factor, ATF4 (Yang et al., 2004). Several lines of ev-
idence of molecular, genetic or pharmacological nature estab-
lish that ATF4 is a mediator of neuroﬁbromin signaling in osteo-
blasts. First, RSK2 phosphorylation is increased as is ATF4
phosphorylation on serine 251 in Nf12/2 osteoblasts, thus ex-
plaining the increase in collagen synthesis and in Osteocalcin
expression; second, PKA activity is increased as is ATF4 phos-
phorylation on serine 254 and as a result, Rankl expression, os-
2/2 mice.

ondary, at least in part, to an increase in amino acid import in
other cell types? That Rsk2 and other members of this family
of kinases as well as other members of the CREB family of tran-
scription factors are expressed in neurons give some credence
to this hypothesis that can easily be tested. Second, one can
wonder whether development of other skeletal dysplasiae may
not be affected by amino acid intake. Although this is a valid hy-
pothesis, we should stress here that this notion applies only to
ATF4-related diseases. More generally, our results illustrate
how the precise knowledge of the molecular mechanism of
action of a given gene involved in the pathogenesis of human
genetic disease can potentially translate into therapeutic
interventions.

Experimental procedures

Generation of mutant mice and animal treatments
The generation of 2.3kb a1 (I) collagen cre mice, Nf1 ﬂox, Atf42/2, Rsk22/2,
Runx22/2, and Osx2/2 mice have been described (Dacquin et al., 2002; Na-
kashima et al., 2002; Otto et al., 1997; Yang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2001). WT
2/2 are cre(+); Nf1ﬂox/Nf1ﬂox. Alpha(I) colla-
are cre(2); Nf1ﬂox/Nf1ﬂox, Nf1ob
gen-Atf4 construct was generated by cloning the Atf4 genomic sequence
30 of the 2.3 a1(I) Collagen promoter and 50 of a mp1 polyA signal in the
pJ251 vector. All mice used in this study were backcrossed on a C57BL6
2/2 mice were administered PD198306
background. Four week-old Nf1ob
daily (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks by oral gavage. Normal diet (Picolab-Roden
20% #5053, TEKLAD, Madison, WI) contained 23.6% protein, 64.5% carbo-
hydrate and 11.9% fat. High-protein diet (TD94266, TEKLAD) contained
53.3% protein, 33.6% carbohydrate and 13.1% fat. High-fat diet (DI12331,
Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) contained 16% protein, 26% carbohy-
drate, and 58% fat. Low-protein diet (TD92208, TEKLAD) contained 10.8%
protein, 76.0% carbohydrate, and 13.2% fat. All animal protocols were ap-
proved by the Animal Care Committees of Baylor College of Medicine.

Morphometric measurements
Static and dynamic histomorphometry measurements were performed as
previously described in accordance with standard nomenclature, using the
Osteomeasure Analysis System (Osteometrics, Inc) (Ducy et al., 2000; Parﬁtt
et al., 1987; Takeda et al., 2002). 3D microtomographic measurements were
performed at 12microns resolution under the growth plate (Scanco Medical,
Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Four to 9 animals were assigned per group.

Cell cultures
Calvaria osteoblasts were extracted by triple collagenase/trypsine digestion
from 4 day-old CD1 pups and differentiated with ascorbic acid as previously
described (Ducy et al., 2000). Cre-mediated recombination efﬁciency was
performed with differentiated calvarial osteoblasts. PCR was performed as
originally described {Zhu, 2001 #1650}. Osteoclast differentiation assays
were performed using Percoll gradient-puriﬁed BMM isolated from WT
2/2 bones, in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL
and Nf1ob
(50 ng/ml) for 4 days. Osteoblast/osteoclasts cocultures were performed in
triplicate in 48-well plates using WT and Nf12/2 calvaria osteoblasts and
BMM in the presence of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1028M, Calbiochem) for
4 days (Takahashi et al., 1988). In vitro TRAP staining was performed at
day 4 using the Acid Phosphatase Leukocyte kit (Sigma). Only TRAP-positive
multinucleated (n > 3 nuclei) were counted. Van Gieson and alkaline phos-
phatase staining was performed using established protocols using buffered
10% formalin-ﬁxed osteoblasts.

Gene expression studies
Osteoblasts were treated in serum-free medium with vehicle, U0126 (30 mM,
Promega) or H89 (10 mM, Sigma) for 24 hr. Total RNA were extracted with Tri-
zol (Invitrogen). cDNA were generated using the ABI Reverse transcriptase
system and random hexanucleotide primers. Real-time PCR was performed
using Taqman ABI probes/primers on a 9700 ABI cycler and 18S rRNA ex-
pression as endogenous control. Northern blot analyses were performed us-
ing 15 mg of total RNA and 32P-labeled probes. PCR primers used for trans-
genic and endogenous Atf4 expression are available upon request. In situ

Figure 6. Roles of neuroﬁbromin in the regulation of bone remodeling

In osteoblasts, neuroﬁbromin reduces Ras, MAPK and RSK2 signaling, leading to
a decrease in ATF4 transcriptional activity via reduced phosphorylation of 251Ser-
ine. This leads to a reduction in protein translation and collagen synthesis. Neuro-
ﬁbromin also decreases PKA activity leading to a reduction of ATF4 phosphoryla-
tion at Serine 254. As a result, Rankl expression and osteoclast differentiation are
normally decreased by neuroﬁbromin. The asterisk denotes proteins whose loss
causes skeletal dysplasiae treatable by dietary manipulations. Modulation of
amino acid supply can correct the defects of protein translation and collagen syn-
thesis mediated by Nf1 or RSK2 mutations.

In that respect it is worthwhile to note that CREB phosphoryla-
tion was increased in Nf1-deﬁcient osteoblasts (data not
shown). The possible involvement of CREB (or of other tran-
scription factors) in this signaling cascade will have to await
the generation of mutant mice lacking CREB only in osteoblasts.

Rescue of ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasia through
diets in mice
ATF4 is a peculiar player in the ﬁeld of transcriptional control of
bone formation as it has at least two mechanisms of action. It
regulates osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteo-
blast-speciﬁc genes such as Osteocalcin, however, Osteocalcin
deletion does not delay bone formation (Ducy et al., 1996; Yang
et al., 2004). At the same time, it promotes amino acid import in
osteoblasts by activating genes encoding membrane trans-
porters (Harding et al., 2003). The observation that NF1 skeletal
manifestations worsen overtime and reappear after surgical
treatment in patients suggested to us that the former mode of
action of ATF4 may explain this feature of NF skeletal manifes-
tations. Consistent with this hypothesis, reducing protein intake
normalized all skeletal manifestations related to the ability of
2/2 mice. Con-
ATF4 to favor amino acid import in cells of Nf1ob
versely, increasing protein intake in a mouse model of Cofﬁn-
Lowry Syndrome rescued the skeletal manifestations observed
in adult mice. Remarkably, these latter manipulations also res-
cued all skeletal developmental abnormalities in both Atf42/2
and Rsk22/2 embryos, thus revealing that food intake affects
skeletal development or at least ATF4-dependent events in
this process.

These ﬁndings raise several questions beyond NF1 skeletal
manifestations per se; ﬁrst, are other manifestations in NF1 sec-

hybridization analyses were performed using 4% PFA-ﬁxed embryos em-
bedded in parafﬁn, according to standard procedures (Ducy et al., 1997).

Biochemical studies
Osteoblasts were treated in serum-free medium with vehicle or U0126 (30
mM) for 6 hr. Lysates from primary osteoblasts or crushed frozen bones
were prepared in RIPA buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Twenty to 60ug of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in re-
ducing conditions and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane using stan-
dard protocols. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies includ-
ing total or anti-Phospho ATF4 (Elefteriou et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2004), total
and anti-Phospho GCN2 (Harding et al., 2003), eIF2a (Cell Signaling), RSK2
(Dumont et al., 2005), CREB (Upstate), AKT, p38 (Santa Cruz) antibodies.
Type I collagen from crushed frozen bones (20 mg) or calvaria primary oste-
oblast was extracted twice with pepsin (1 mg/ml) in 0.5 M acetic acid for 72 hr
at 4C. Collagen was precipitated by NaCl (0.7% ﬁnal concentration) over-
night and collected by centrifugation. Collagen pellets were resolubilized in
0.5M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE in presence
of 2 M urea, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-collagen type I an-
tibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) (Bashey et al., 1989). Anti-actin antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used for loading. Protein kinase A assay
(Stressgen) was performed in the presence of 10% FBS. Ras assay (Cell Sig-
naling) was performed using differentiated WT and Nf12/2 osteoblasts fol-
lowing overnight starvation and 2 min stimulation with 10% FBS and accord-
ing to manufacturer’s recommendations. In short, cells were washed and
lysed in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, supernatants
were assessed for protein concentration and kinase reaction was performed
in the presence of ATP. PKA activity values were corrected for protein con-
centration. All biochemical assays were performed using WT and Nf12/2 os-
teoblasts grown and treated simultaneously. Serum measurements for PTH
(Immunotopics), calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma)
were performed according to the manufacturer recommendations. Deoxy-
pyridinoline cross-links and Creatinine were measured using the Pyrilinks-
D and creatinine kits (Metra Biosystems).

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed
by Student’s test. Values were considered statistically signiﬁcant when
p < 0.05.
