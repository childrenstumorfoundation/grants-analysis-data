 ABSTRACT  

   The high frequency of activating  RAS  or  BRAF  mutations in cancer provides strong 
rationale  for  targeting  the  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  pathway. 
Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efﬁ cacy in patients with 
melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with 
pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we 
describe  the  identiﬁ cation  and  characterization  of  SCH772984,  a  novel  and  selective  inhibitor  of 
ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984  has nanomolar 
cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in  BRAF ,  NRAS , or  KRAS  and induces tumor regressions 
in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signal-
ing and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor–resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant 
to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development 
of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors. 
  SIGNIFICANCE:  BRAF and MEK inhibitors have activity in MAPK-dependent cancers with  BRAF  or  RAS  muta-
tions. However, resistance is associated with pathway alterations resulting in phospho-ERK  reactivation. 
Here, we describe a novel ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor that has antitumor activity in MAPK inhibitor-naïve and 
MAPK inhibitor-resistant cells containing  BRAF  or  RAS  mutations.  Cancer Discov; 3(7); 742–50. ©2013 AACR.

ERK Inhibitor Efﬁ cacy in BRAF and MEK Inhibitor Resistance

RESEARCH BRIEF

 INTRODUCTION 

 Speciﬁ c  inhibitors  of  RAF  and  MEK  kinases  have  been 
developed  to  target   BRAF -  and   RAS -mutant  tumors  ( 1–6 ). 
In  particular,  the  BRAF  inhibitor  vemurafenib  (formerly 
PLX4032)  has  been  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration– 
approved for the treatment of  BRAF  V600E  -mutant metastatic 
melanoma ( 7 ). Although these results are encouraging, dura-
ble  responses  are  limited  by  acquired  resistance  occurring 
at  a  median  time  of  approximately  6  to  7  months  ( 2 ,   8 ). 
The  combination  of  the  BRAF  inhibitor  dabrafenib  with 
the MEK inhibitor trametinib has shown signiﬁ cant clinical 
beneﬁ t  in   BRAF -mutant  melanoma  compared  with  BRAF 
or  MEK  inhibitor  monotherapy  ( 1 ).  Interestingly,  BRAF/
MEK  inhibitor  combination  treatment  has  been  shown  to 
block  phosphorylated  extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase 
( phospho-ERK) reactivation in melanoma cells ( 9, 10 ), a phe-
nomenon that may possibly reduce the emergence of clinical 
resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to BRAF/MEK combina-
tion  therapy  are  currently  unknown,  but  ERK  represents  an 
attractive downstream target to exploit. To this end, we devel-
oped and characterized SCH772984, a novel, speciﬁ c inhibitor 
of ERK1/2 activity, and show robust efﬁ cacy in  RAS - or  BRAF -
mutant cancer cells. Moreover, SCH772984 was also effective 

in single-agent BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistance as well as in 
cells that became resistant to the combination of these agents.   

 RESULTS 

 A selective ERK inhibitor was identiﬁ ed using an afﬁ nity-
based  mass  spectroscopy  high-throughput  platform  ( 11 ).  A 
library of approximately 5 million compounds was screened 
for binding to the unphosphorylated form of the ERK2 pro-
tein. Synthetic chemistry efforts improved enzymatic potency 
and  selectivity,  culminating  in  the  synthesis  of  the  ATP-
competitive  compound  SCH772984  ( Fig.  1A ).  SCH772984 
potently inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 activity with IC 50  values 
of  4  and  1  nmol/L,  respectively  ( Fig.  1B ).  SCH772984  is 
highly selective, with only seven kinases of 300 tested show-
ing more than 50% inhibition at a concentration of 1 μ mol/L 
(Supplementary Table S1).  

 Treatment  of  the   BRAF  V600E  -mutant  human  melanoma 
cell  line  LOXIMV1  (LOX)  with  SCH772984  resulted  in  a 
dose-dependent  inhibition  of  phosphorylation  of  the  ERK 
substrate  p90  ribosomal  S6  kinase  (T359/S363  phospho-
RSK;  Fig. 1C ). Unexpectedly, SCH772984 also inhibited phos-
phorylation  of  residues  in  the  activation  loop  of  ERK  itself

RESEARCH BRIEF

Morris et al.

(T202/Y204  and  T185/Y187  of  ERK1  and  ERK2,  respec-
tively), a modiﬁ cation catalyzed by the ERK-activating kinases, 
MEK 1 and MEK 2. This latter observation was unexpected 
given that SCH772984 did not directly inhibit MEK1, MEK2, 
BRAF,  or  CRAF  enzyme  activity  ( Fig.  1B ;  Supplementary 
Table  S1).  To  further  rule  out  a  direct  interaction  between 
SCH772984 and MEK, the binding of SCH772984 to MEK1 
(or  ERK2  as  a  positive  control)  was  evaluated  biophysi-
cally using a temperature-dependent ﬂ uorescence (TdF) assay 
( Fig. 1D  and Supplementary Fig. S1). As a control, the allos-
teric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 speciﬁ cally bound MEK1. 
Consistent  with  results  from  the  kinase  panel,  SCH772984 
bound both puriﬁ ed unphosphorylated and phosphorylated 
ERK2 proteins but did not bind to puriﬁ ed MEK1. 

 To  further  elucidate  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
SCH772984,  we  compared  its  mitogen-activated  protein 
kinase  (MAPK)  pathway  inhibition  with  that  of  the  pre-
viously  described  ATP-competitive  ERK  inhibitor  VTX-11e 
( 12, 13 ). In the  BRAF  V600E  -mutant A375 melanoma cell line, 
both  compounds  inhibited  the  formation  of  phospho-RSK 
in  a  dose-dependent  manner  ( Fig.  1E ).  Interestingly,  and 
in  contrast  to  the  inhibition  of  phospho-ERK  seen  with 
SCH772984,  phospho-ERK  increased  in  cells  treated  with 
VTX-11e.  VTX-11e–mediated  reactivation  of  phospho-ERK 
is  likely  due  to  feedback  activation  as  previously  described 
(reviewed  in  ref.   14 ).  Increased  ERK  phosphorylation  was 
similarly  observed  following  PLX4032  treatment  in   KRAS -
mutant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). This was abolished 
by treatment with SCH772984 conﬁ rming that SCH772984 
prevents MEK-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, 
although the inhibition of phospho-ERK and phospho-RSK 
by SCH772984 was sustained for 24 hours, by 36 hours, the 
inhibition of phospho-ERK was lost, whereas the inhibition 
of  phospho-RSK  was  maintained  (Supplementary  Fig.  S3). 
Further  pathway  analysis  showed  that  SCH772984  reduced 
pCRAF S289/S296/S301 phosphorylation (direct ERK phos-
phorylation sites that inhibit CRAF activity; ref.  15 ), suggest-
ing that rebound ERK phosphorylation is a result of CRAF 
upregulation.  Taken  together,  we  hypothesize  that,  in  addi-
tion to ATP-competitive inhibition of ERK1/2 catalytic activ-
ity, SCH772984 induces or stabilizes a conformational state 
in ERK that prevents activation by MEK, and this is sufﬁ cient 
to maintain ERK inhibition even in the presence of feedback 
signaling by CRAF. 

 The  studies  described  above  established  SCH772984  as  a 
potent  inhibitor  of  ERK  in   BRAF -  and   KRAS -mutant  cells. 
To determine the selectivity of SCH772984 in these contexts, 
we assessed  in vitro  antiproliferative activity in a panel of 121 
human tumor cell lines ( Fig. 2A , Supplementary Fig. S4, and 
Supplementary  Table  S2).  SCH772984  showed  EC 50   values 
less  than  500  nmol/L  (deﬁ ned  as  responders)  in  approxi-
mately 88% and 49% of  BRAF- mutant ( n  = 25) or  RAS- mutant 
( n  = 35) tumor lines, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). Flow cytometric 
analysis  of  SCH772984-sensitive  melanoma  cells  revealed  a 
G 1  arrest as well as an increase in the sub-G 1  fraction indica-
tive of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S5). Less than 20% of 
cells wild-type for both  RAS  and  BRAF  ( n  = 61) were sensitive 
to SCH772984 ( Fig. 2A ).  

  In  vivo   antitumor  efﬁ cacy  of  SCH772984  was  evaluated 
in   BRAF -  or   KRAS -mutant  xenograft  models  established 

from  human  melanoma  or  pancreatic  carcinoma  cell  lines. 
Treatment of  BRAF -mutant LOX melanoma xenografts with 
SCH772984 (50 mg/kg twice daily) led to 98% tumor regres-
sion  ( Fig.  2B ).  Dose-dependent  antitumor  activity  was  also 
observed  in  the   KRAS -mutant  pancreatic  MiaPaCa  model, 
with 36% regression at 50 mg/kg twice daily ( Fig. 2C ). Impor-
tantly,  tumor  regression  was  accompanied  by  robust  inhi-
bition  of  ERK  phosphorylation  in  tumor  tissue  ( Fig.  2D ). 
SCH772984 was well tolerated on this schedule as measured 
by morbidity, lethality, or body weight loss ( Fig. 2E ). 

 MAPK  inhibitors  are  currently  in  development  for   BRAF - 
and  RAS -mutant cancers, and the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib 
(PLX4032)  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of   BRAF -mutant 
metastatic  melanoma.  Despite  impressive  initial  clinical 
responses to MAPK inhibitors, most patients relapse (reviewed 
in ref.  16 ). To determine whether SCH772984 was efﬁ cacious 
in  models  of  BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitor  resistance,  we  gen-
erated   BRAF -mutant  melanoma  or   KRAS -mutant  colorectal 
cancer  cell  lines  resistant  to  the  BRAF  inhibitor  PLX4032 
or  the  MEK  inhibitor  GSK1120212,  respectively.  Cell  lines 
were serially passaged in the presence of escalating concentra-
tions of compound over a period of 4 to 8 months. Cell line 
pools became resistant to high-dose PLX4032 (10 μ mol/L) or 
GSK1120212 (1 μ mol/L), as evidenced by robust proliferation 
in  the  presence  of  inhibitor  (data  not  shown).  Acquired  acti-
vating mutations in  KRAS G13D   or  NRAS G12C   were identiﬁ ed in 
PLX4032-resistant  BRAF -mutant A375 melanoma ( Fig. 3A and 
B )  or  PLX4032-resistant   BRAF- mutant  RKO  colorectal  (Sup-
plementary Fig. S6) lines, respectively. GSK1120212 resistance 
was associated with acquired mutations in  MEK1  ( MEK1 V211D   
mutation  in   BRAF -mutant  RKO  and   MEK1 G128D/L215P    muta-
tions in  KRAS -mutant HCT116;  Fig. 3C ), consistent with pre-
viously described alleles that confer AZD6244 resistance ( 17 ). 
Acquisition  of  drug  resistance  was  accompanied  by  pathway 
reactivation  as  indicated  by  increased  baseline  phospho-ERK 
levels  ( Fig.  3B )  and  increased  transcription  of   DUSP6 ,   MYC , 
 LIF , and  IL8 , well-known MAPK target genes (Supplementary 
Fig. S7). SCH772984 showed potent growth inhibition in all of 
the resistant models described above, with IC 50  values similar 
to  those  observed  in  parental  lines  ( Fig.  3   and  Supplemen-
tary  Fig.  S6).  As  expected,  phospho-ERK,  phospho-RSK,  and 
mRNA levels for  DUSP6 ,  MYC ,  LIF , and  IL8  were all decreased 
following SCH772984 treatment ( Figs. 3B  and Supplementary 
Fig. S7).  

  BRAF   ampliﬁ cation  as  well  as  expression  of  drug- resistant 
 BRAF   splice-variants  lacking  N-terminal  regulatory  regions 
have  been  described  as  clinical  resistance  mechanisms  in 
patients with PLX4032-relapsed melanoma, whereas  MEK1 P124L   
was  identiﬁ ed  in  a  patient  who  relapsed  on  treatment  with 
the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 ( 10 ,  17–19 ). Importantly,  BRAF  
ampliﬁ cation has been shown to mediate cross-resistance to 
MEK inhibitors ( 10 ), whereas  MEK  mutations mediate cross-
resistance to BRAF inhibitors ( 17 ,  20 ). To test whether ERK 
blockade  was  efﬁ cacious  in  the  context  of  these  clinically 
observed  resistance  mechanisms,  stable  cell  lines  express-
ing  each  of  these  variants  were  engineered  in  a   BRAF V600E   
A375  background.  As  shown  in   Fig.  3D ,  overexpression  of 
 KRAS G13D   (positive control),  BRAF  V600E   (to simulate ampliﬁ ca-
tion), or  BRAFV600 EΔ 2-8   all conferred resistance to PLX4032, 
whereas  overexpression  of   MEK1 P124L    (residue  proximal  to

 Figure 2.      SCH772984 is efﬁ cacious in  BRAF - or  RAS -mutant tumor cells. A,  in vitro  activity of SCH772984 in a panel of human tumor cell lines (sum-
mary of primary data from Supplementary Fig. S3). B,  in vivo  activity of SCH772984 in human LOX  BRAF- mutant melanoma xenograft model. Female 
nude mice bearing human LOX  BRAF V600E   tumors more than 100 mm 3  in size were dosed twice daily with vehicle or SCH772984 (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg) 
for 14 days ( n   = 10/group). Dosing occurred from day 1 to day 14. Tumor volume was measured and growth curves were derived from the mean tumor 
volume in each dose. The percent change in volume is shown after 14 days. Tumor regressions were observed at all doses (17% at 12.5 mg/kg, 84% at 
25 mg/kg, and 98% at 50 mg/kg). C,  in vivo  activity of SCH772984 in human MiaPaCa  KRAS- mutant pancreatic xenograft model. Mice were dosed twice 
daily with vehicle or with 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of SCH772984. Tumor regressions were observed at both doses (9% tumor regression at 25 mg/kg 
and 36% tumor regression at 50 mg/kg dose). D, target engagement of SCH772984 on phospho-ERK in LOX melanoma xenograft tumors. On day 14 
after the last dose (6 hours) of 12.5 mg/kg of SCH772984 (lanes 4–5) or vehicle (lanes 1–3), LOX xenograft tumors were harvested (three mice/group) 
and homogenates from excised tumors were probed for phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 levels by Western blots. E, body weights of female nude mice 
with SCH772984 relative to control animals (in MiaPaCa xenograft). No drug related lethality was observed at all doses. mpk, mg/kg; bid, twice daily.

to  GSK1120212.  In  addition,  expression  of   MEK1 F129L    (allo-
steric binding site mutant with enhanced activity; refs.  17 ,  21 ) 
or   MEK1 DD    (constitutively  active  mutant  with  aspartic  acid 
replacement  of  activating  loop  serine  residues;  ref.   17 )  all 
mediated  resistance  to  PLX4032  (Supplementary  Fig.  S8). 
Treatment  with  SCH772984  was  efﬁ cacious  in  all  contexts 
described above, suggesting that cells that circumvent BRAF 
or  MEK  inhibitor  therapy  and  reactivate  ERK  signaling 
remain dependent on ERK. 

 In  a  recent  clinical  study,  the  combination  of  a  BRAF 
inhibitor  with  a  MEK  inhibitor  doubled  the  progression-

free  survival  beneﬁ t  relative  to  either  monotherapy  ( 1 ).  As 
this  combination  could  potentially  become  the  standard-
of-care  for   BRAF  V600E    melanoma,  we  sought  to  develop 
melanoma  models  resistant  to  BRAF/MEK  double  block-
ade  and  evaluate  their  responsiveness  to  ERK  inhibition. 
 BRAF V600E  -containing A101D melanoma cells were double-
selected  with  PLX4032  and  GSK1120212  until  resistant 
cells  proliferated  at  similar  rates  compared  with  parental 
( Fig. 4A ). BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination resistance 
led  to  strong  reactivation  of  the  MAPK  pathway  as  meas-
ured by phospho-ERK and phospho-RSK, either in the pres-
ence or absence of both compounds ( Fig. 4B ). SCH772984

 Figure 3.      SCH772984 is efﬁ cacious in tumor cell lines refractory to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. A, SCH772984 is equally potent in naïve or 
PLX4032-resistant,  BRAF- mutant A375 melanoma cells (A375BR). B, SCH772984 potently inhibits phospho-ERK (pERK) and phospho-RSK (pRSK) in 
naïve and PLX4032-resistant  BRAF -mutant A375 melanoma cells. C, SCH772984 is equally potent in naïve or GSK1120212-resistant,  BRAF- mutant RKO 
colorectal cancer cells (RKOMR) or  KRAS- mutant HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (HCT116MR). D, SCH772984 is efﬁ cacious in  BRAF -mutant melanoma 
cells engineered to express various clinically relevant BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistance mechanisms. The ectopic expression of  KRAS G13D   (as positive 
control),  BRAF V600E  , or  BRAF V600EΔ 2-8  , but not red ﬂ uorescence protein (RFP, as negative control), induces resistance to PLX4032. Ectopic expression of 
 MEK1 P124L   induces resistance to GSK1120212. In all cases, little to no cross-resistance was observed with SCH772984. Cells were treated for 5 days 
followed by ViaLight assay. Overexpression of each was conﬁ rmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). All data are depicted as mean ± SE ( N  = 6).

 Figure 4.      SCH772984 is efﬁ cacious in BRAF and MEK combination resistance in  BRAF- mutant A101D melanoma cells. A, IncuCyte analysis of real 
time growth conﬂ uence (imaged every 2 hours) of parental and A101D BR + MR cells shows similar growth rates despite the presence of high concentra-
tions of PLX4032 (10 μmol/L) and GSK1120212 (1 μmol/L). Treatment with SCH772984 (either alone or in combination with BRAF + MEK inhibitor) is 
efﬁ cacious in both naïve and resistant lines. B, A101D BR + MR cells acquire ERK pathway reactivation which is inhibited by SCH772984 (both in the 
presence and absence of the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination during the experiment). C, SCH772984 treatment IC 50  values on 5-day ViaLight viability

effectively  reduced  phospho-ERK/phospho-RSK  ( Fig.  4B ) 
and  inhibited  proliferation  in  the  dually  resistant  A101D 
melanoma  cells  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  both  BRAF 
and MEK inhibitors with IC 50  values similar to the parental 
line ( Fig. 4A and C ). Similar results were obtained with the 
BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  combination-resistant   BRAF -mutant 
RKO colorectal line (Supplementary Fig. S9).  

 MAPK pathway mutational analysis of parental and dual-
resistant lines identiﬁ ed acquired  NRAS G12C  ,  MEK1 V211D  , and 
 MEK1 L215P    mutations  in  PLX4032-resistant  RKO  cells  con-
sistent  with  MAPK  pathway  reactivation  (Supplementary 
Fig.  S9).  Interestingly,  dual-resistant  A101D  cells  did  not 
acquire  mutations  in   BRAF ,   HRAS ,   NRAS ,   KRAS ,   MAP2K1  
 MAPK3  
(MEK1), 
(ERK1)  in  all  coding  exons  analyzed  (see  Methods).  How-
ever, in addition to strong ERK reactivation ( Fig. 4 ), we also 
identiﬁ ed upregulation of BRAF, CRAF, PDGFRB, IGF1RB, 
and phospho-AKT in this line (Supplementary Fig. S10) con-
sistent  with  previous  reported  resistance  mechanisms  for 
vemurafenib as well as cross-resistance mechanisms for MEK 
inhibitors.  Taken  together,  these  results  suggest  that  ERK 

 MAPK1   (ERK2),  or 

 MAP2K2   (MEK2), 

inhibitors such as SCH772984 could be beneﬁ cial for BRAF 
and MEK inhibitor refractory disease with ERK reactivation.   

 DISCUSSION 

 Targeted drug therapy in biomarker-selected patient popu-
lations is gaining broad acceptance as an effective way to treat 
cancer based on the inherent genetics of the tumor. Toward 
that end, SCH772984, a potent and selective ERK inhibitor, 
was  developed  for  treating  malignancies  dependent  on  dys-
regulated  MAPK  signaling.  Our  data  implicate  ERK  inhibi-
tion as a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with 
 BRAF -,   KRAS -,  or   NRAS -mutant  tumors,  including  patients 
who relapse on BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy. 

 SCH772984 possessed strong, preferential activity in a large 
panel  of  biomarker-positive  (i.e.,   BRAF -,   KRAS -,  and   NRAS - 
mutant)  cell  lines   in  vitro   and  also  produced   in  vivo   tumor 
regressions in xenograft models. Like other MAPK inhibitors, 
SCH772984  showed  broader  activity  in  a  panel  of   BRAF -
mutant  cells  than  in   KRAS   or   NRAS   mutants.  This  was 
expected  given  the  known  importance  of  MAPK  signaling

downstream of activated BRAF. However, in the future, it will 
be important to understand why some  RAS -mutant cells are 
naturally more resistant to SCH772984, as these mechanisms 
could limit its clinical use. 

 It certain contexts, it has been shown that RAF inhibitor 
efﬁ cacy can be limited by ERK reactivation that occurs within 
24 hours ( 22 ). As SCH772984 effectively inhibited both ERK 
enzymatic  activity  as  well  as  its  phosphorylation  by  MEK, 
we  wondered  whether  SCH772984  might  have  the  ability 
to  block  ERK  phosphorylation  in  the  context  of  negative 
feedback pathway activation. Like vemurafenib, SCH772984 
induced  rebound  signaling  kinetics.  MAPK  signaling  was 
nearly  completely  eliminated  through  the  initial  24  hours 
of compound treatment. Thereafter, a loss of ERK-mediated 
inhibitory CRAF phosphorylation (S289/S296/S301; ref.  15 ) 
was observed, as well as dramatic increases in phospho-ERK. 
Despite  negative  feedback  activation  up  to  and  including 
phospho-ERK, SCH772984 maintained a signaling blockade 
between ERK and RSK. These results suggest that SCH772984 
has  a  stronger  ability  to  inhibit  ERK  catalytic  activity  than 
MEK  phosphorylation  of  ERK  (which  was  apparently  over-
whelmed  in  this  setting).  Furthermore,  this  durable  inhibi-
tion  of  pRSK  in  the  context  of  negative  feedback  favorably 
distinguishes SCH772984 from BRAF inhibitors. 

 While  tumors  can  take  multiple  paths  to  RAF  inhibitor 
resistance, one common feature seems to be the reactivation 
of the ERK pathway. Because of its ability to inhibit at a dis-
tinct, downstream intervention point in the MAPK pathway, 
SCH772984 has the potential to overcome resistance induced 
by  MEK  or  BRAF  inhibitors.  We  examined  SCH772984  in 
various  models  of  previously  described,  clinically  relevant 
BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitor  resistance,  including  acquired   RAS  
mutations,  acquired   MEK1   mutations,  overexpression  of 
 BRAF  V600E  ,  or  a  splice-variant  lacking  an  amino-terminal 
RAS-binding domain, as well as ectopic expression of various 
 MEK1   mutants  (including  constitutively  active).  In  all  sce-
narios tested, SCH772984 treatment produced IC 50  values in 
viability assays similar to what was observed in parental cells. 
One exception was the overexpression of either  BRAF  V600E   or 
a   BRAF  V600E    splice-variant  lacking  exons  2  to  8  (insensitive 
to vemurafenib inhibition due to constitutive dimerization), 
whereby  we  observed  an  approximately  tenfold  IC 50   shift 
toward cross-resistance. Currently, the mechanism responsi-
ble for this low-level cross-resistance is unknown and further 
study is necessary. However, when we attempted to hyperac-
tivate ERK to high levels (i.e., overexpression of constitutively 
active  MEK1),  we  observed  little  no  cross-resistance.  This 
suggests that the ERK node may represent a rate-limiting step 
within the MAPK pathway that is subject to less ﬂ uctuation 
with  regard  to  biologic  signaling  (and  hence  less  potential 
for  an  IC 50   shift  during  cross-resistance).  For  these  reasons, 
targeting  ERK  may  be  more  effective  than  targeting  MEK, 
especially in light of evidence suggesting limited clinical tra-
metinib activity in BRAF inhibitor–refractory melanoma ( 23 ). 
 Development of effective combination strategies is expected 
to  reduce  the  incidence  of  clinical  resistance  that  is  common 
with single-agent targeted therapies. The combination of BRAF 
and  MEK  inhibition  in   BRAF -mutant  melanoma  is  a  good 
example of the clinical beneﬁ t that can be obtained from this 
approach.  Although  the  clinical  mechanisms  of  resistance  to 

these combinations are largely unknown, we expect that mul-
tiple mechanisms resulting in pathway reactivation, or perhaps 
a single downstream mechanism, might be sufﬁ cient for tumor 
escape.  In  this  study,  we  show  phospho-ERK  reactivation  in 
two models of BRAF and MEK combination therapy resistance. 
SCH772984 was effective in blocking proliferation in both mod-
els. Interestingly, in one model, the dual-resistant cells did not 
acquire mutations in the MAPK pathway but rather upregulated 
known RTKs previously described to mediate PLX4032 resist-
ance  as  well  as  cross-resistance  to  MEK  inhibitors  (i.e.,  PDG-
FRB; ref.  24 ). Acquired RTK activation in dual-resistant A101D 
cells  was  accompanied  by  both  phospho-ERK  and  phospho-
AKT  activation.  However,  this  cell  line  was  still  dependent 
on ERK signaling, as shown by its upregulation of BRAF and 
CRAF  as  well  as  its  response  to  SCH772984.  Taken  together, 
our results suggest that clinical resistance to BRAF/MEK com-
bination therapy will likely involve multiple mechanisms result-
ing in ERK pathway reactivation. Moreover, our data indicate 
that these mechanisms will likely be similar to those reported to 
mediate resistance to BRAF or MEK as single agents. 

 Given that ERK is directly downstream of BRAF and MEK, 
targeting the MAPK pathway at the level of ERK might offer 
unique advantages in a variety of MAPK resistance settings. 
Moreover, ERK directly signals to more than 100 known cel-
lular proteins that are important for tumor cell proliferation, 
survival,  and  apoptosis  (e.g.,  pRSK,  MYC,  BIM).  It  will  be 
important to deﬁ ne the optimal point of intervention in this 
critical signaling pathway to aid the development of effective 
therapeutics for  BRAF - and  RAS -mutant cancers. SCH772984 
and related compounds provide potent and selective tools to 
help  address  this  question  either  alone  or  in  combination 
with other MAPK inhibitors.   

 METHODS  
  Cell Lines and Treatments  

 For  resistant   cell  line  creation,  cells  were  grown  in  Dulbecco’s 
Modiﬁ ed  Eagle  Medium  with  10%  heat-inactivated  FBS  media  and 
increasing  concentrations  of  inhibitor  (PLX4032,  0.1–10  μ mol/L; 
GSK1120212, 0.01–1 μ mol/L) over approximately 4 to 8 months until 
resistant cells acquired growth properties similar to naïve parental cells 
(at  their  top  drug  concentrations).  For  combination  resistance,  cells 
were incubated as above but with alternative dose escalation until a top 
concentration was acquired (PLX4032 10 μ mol/L and GSK1120212 1 
μ mol/L). The identities of all cell lines used for these studies were con-
ﬁ rmed using short tandem repeat DNA analysis at the American Type 
Culture  Collection.  Stocks  and  dilutions  of  PLX4032,  GSK1120212, 
and  SCH772984  were  made  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  solvent. 
Cell  proliferation  experiments  were  carried  out  in  a  96-well  format 
(six  replicates),  and  cells  were  plated  at  a  density  of  4,000  cells  per 
well. At 24 hours after cell seeding, cells were treated with DMSO or 
a 9-point IC 50  dilution (0.001–10 μ mol/L) at a ﬁ nal concentration of 
1%  DMSO  for  all  concentrations.  Viability  was  assayed  5  days  after 
dosing  using  the  ViaLight  luminescence  kit  (Lonza)  following  the 
manufacturer’s recommendations ( n  = 6, mean ± SE). For the cell line 
panel viability assay, cells were treated with SCH772984 for 4 days and 
assayed by the CellTiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). 
For IncuCyte analysis, cells were plated as above in 96-well plates, and 
image-based cell conﬂ uence data were collected every 2 hours during

ERK Inhibitor Efﬁ cacy in BRAF and MEK Inhibitor Resistance

RESEARCH BRIEF

2–8  (Δ 2-8),   MEK1 P124L  ,   MEK1 F129L  ,  or  constitutively  active   MEK1 DD   
(S218D+S222D). Cells were selected in blasticidin (20 μ g/mL) and used 
for ViaLight assays as described above.   

  Genomic DNA Sequencing  

 Primer extension sequencing was conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. using 
Applied Biosystems BigDye version 3.1. The reactions were then run on 
Applied  Biosystem’s  3730xl  DNA  Analyzer  for  sequencing  of  all  cod-
ing exons in  KRAS ,  HRAS ,  NRAS ,  MAP2K1  (MEK1),  MAP2K2  (MEK2), 
 MAPK1  (ERK2),  MAPK3  (ERK1), or  BRAF  (coding exon 6 and 11–15).   

  Total RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis  

 Treated  cells  were  collected  with  lysis  buffer  and  extraction  of 
RNA  was  conducted  using  the  RNAeasy  mini  Kit  (Ambion)  as  per 
the manufacturer’s directions. RNA samples were eluted in 50 μ L of 
nuclease-free water. cDNA was generated from 2 μ g of RNA by using 
a murine MLV reverse transcriptase ﬁ rst-strand cDNA synthesis kit 
(Applied Biosystems).   

  Real-Time PCR for MAPK Gene Expression  

 PCR reactions were conducted and monitored using an ABI Prism 
7900  Sequence  Detection  system  (Applied  Biosystems).  The  PCR 
master  mix  was  based  on  AmpliTaq  Gold  DNA  polymerase;  cDNA 
samples  were  analyzed  in  duplicate.  Primers  and  probes  were  used 
at concentrations of 100 and 125 nmol/L per reaction, respectively. 
After an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 10 minutes, the cDNA 
products were ampliﬁ ed with 40 PCR cycles (denaturation: 95°C for 
15 seconds; extension: 60°C for 1 minute). For each sample, the  C  t  
value was determined as the cycle number at which the ﬂ uorescence 
intensity  reached  0.05;  this  value  was  chosen  after  conﬁ rming  that 
all  curves  were  in  the  exponential  phase  of  ampliﬁ cation  in  this 
range. Relative  expression was calculated using the delta- C  t  method 
using the following equations: Δ  C  t  (Sample) =  C  t  (Target) −  C  t  (Refer-
ence);  relative  quantity  =  2 –Δ  C   t .  Differentially  expressed  genes  were 
identiﬁ ed using signiﬁ cance analysis. For each cDNA sample, the  C t 
value of each target sequence was normalized to the reference genes 
( GAPDH ,   TUBULIN ,  and   ACTIN ).  Primer  sets  were  obtained  from 
Applied  Biosystems  for  the  following  genes:   DUSP6   (Hs00737962), 
 MYC   (Hs00905030),   LIF   (Hs00171455),   IL8   (Hs00174103),   GAPDH  
(Hs02758991),  ACTIN  (Hs00357333), and  TUBULIN  (Hs00733770).   

  Protein Detection  

 Cell lysates for Western blotting were made in MPER (Thermo Sci-
entiﬁ c) lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein 
(20  μ g)  was  separated  on  4%–20%  Tris-HCl  gel  and  then  trans-
ferred  onto  a  nitrocellulose  membrane.  Western  blots  were  probed 
with  antibodies  against  phospho-ERK1/2  T202/Y204  (Cell  Signal-
ing  Technologies;  CST  #4695),  ERK1/2  Cat  #9107  (CST  #4695), 
phospho-RSK  T359/S363  (Millipore  #04-419),  RSK  (BD  Bioscience 
#610226), phospho-MEK1/2 S217/S221 (CST #9154), MEK1/2 (CST 
#9126), phospho-AKT S473 (CST #9271), AKT (CST #9272), phos-
pho-BRAF  S445  (CST  #2696),  BRAF  (CST  #9433),  phospho-CRAF 
S289/S296/S301  (CST  #9431),  CRAF  (CST  #9422),  PDGFRB  (CST 
#4664),  IGF1RB  (CST  3027),  GAPDH  (Millipore  #CB1001),  and 
Actin (CST #4967).   

  ERK2 IMAP Enzymatic Assay  

 SCH772984  was  tested  in  8-point  dilution  curves  in  duplicate 
against puriﬁ ed ERK1 or ERK2. The enzyme was added to the reac-
tion plate and incubated with the compound before adding a solu-
tion  of  substrate  peptide  and  ATP.  Fourteen  microliters  of  diluted 
enzyme (0.3 ng active ERK2 per reaction) was added to each well of 
a 384-well plate. The plates were gently shaken to mix the reagents 

and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was 
stopped with 60 μ L of IMAP Binding Solution (1:2,200 dilutions of 
IMAP beads in 1× binding buffer). The plates were incubated at room 
temperature for an additional 0.5 hours to allow complete binding 
of phosphopeptides to the IMAP beads. Plates were read on the LJL 
Analyst (LJL BioSystems)   .

  Cell-Cycle Analysis by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting  
 Cell-cycle  analysis  was  conducted  by  propidium  iodide  (PI) 
staining. LOX cells were collected after trypsinization, washed in 
PBS,  and  centrifuged  for  2  minutes  at  1,500  ×   g .  The  cells  were 
resuspended and fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 30 minutes on 
ice or overnight at −20°C. The cell pellets were washed with PBS 
and  resuspended  in  0.5  mL  of  PI  (50  μ g/mL)/0.1%  Triton  X-100 
solution containing RNase and incubated at room temperature in 
the  dark  for  30  minutes.  The  PI-stained  cells  were  analyzed  on  a 
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The cell-cycle pro-
file was determined using both CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) and 
ModFit 3.0 (Verity Software). CellQuest was used to acquire data 
and also determine the percentage of cells in the sub-G 1  popula-
tion. ModFit 3.0 software was used to determine the percentage of 
cells in G 1 , S, and G 2 .   

  Xenograft Tumor Growth Assay  

 Nude  mice  were  injected  subcutaneously  with  speciﬁ c  cell  lines, 
grown  to  approximately  100  mm 3 ,  randomized  to  treatment 
groups  (10  mice/group),  and  treated  intraperitoneally  with  either 
SCH772984  or  vehicle  according  to  the  dosing  schedule  indicated 
in the ﬁ gure legends. Tumor length (L), width (W), and height (H) 
were  measured  during  and  after  the  treatment  periods  by  a  caliper 
twice weekly on each mouse and then used to calculate tumor volume 
using the formula ( L  ×  W  ×  H )/2. Animal body weights were measured 
on the same days twice weekly. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. 
Upon completion of the experiment, vehicle- and SCH772984-treated 
tumor biopsies were processed for Western blot analysis.   

  Kinase Panel Screening  

 The kinase inhibitory proﬁ le of SCH772984 was evaluated over a 

310-kinase panel at Invitrogen.   

  TdF Assay  

 The unfolding of rat ERK2, rat phosphorylated ERK2, and human 
MEK1  proteins  was  conducted  at  a  ﬁ nal  concentration  of  0.5 
μ mol/L  each  in  the  TdF  assay  buffer  (10  mmol/L  HEPES  pH  7.4, 
150  mmol/L  NaCl,  5  mmol/L  MgCl2,  1  mmol/L  DTT)  containing 
a  ﬁ nal  concentration  of  5×  Sypro  Orange  reporter  dye.  The  sam-
ples  contained  10,  5,  or  2.5  μ mol/L  compound  at  a  ﬁ nal  DMSO 
concentration of 2%. Samples were run in 5 μ L in a white 384-well 
real-time PCR plate (Roche Applied Science). The plates were sealed 
with a clear sealing ﬁ lm (Roche Applied Science) and assayed in the 
LightCycler  480-II  (Roche  Applied  Science).  The  temperature  was 
ramped from 23°C to 99°C in 15 minutes. The ﬂ uorescent intensity 
was collected at 15 data points per degree with excitation at 465 nm 
and emission at 580 nm.
