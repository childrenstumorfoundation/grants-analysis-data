Abstract
Approximately 60% of sporadic meningiomas are caused by inactivation of the NF2 tumour
suppressor gene. The causative gene for the remaining meningiomas is unknown. Previous
studies have shown that these tumours have no recurrent karyotypic abnormalities. They
differ from their NF2-related counterparts in that they are more often of the meningothelial
subtype and are located preferentially in the anterior skull base. To gain more insight
into the aetiology of these tumours, we studied genetic and epigenetic alterations in 25
meningiomas without NF2 involvement. We ﬁrst established a genome-wide allelotype using
3 microsatellite markers per chromosome arm. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected
at a low frequency and no indication for the location of putative tumour suppressor genes
could be established. We next screened the subtelomeric regions by using 2–3 polymorphic
markers close to each telomere. Again no evidence for LOH of a particular chromosome arm
was obtained, and no LOH was found in the genomic regions containing the NF2-related
ERM family members ezrin and radixin, DAL-1, protein 4.1R, and TSLC1. Mutations in
the X-chromosome based family member, moesin, were analysed by SSCP and were not
detected. Microsatellite instability was studied using 6 commonly used markers but none
of these was altered in any meningioma. Methylation was detected in 5 of 16 genes (NF2,
p14ARF , CDH1, BRCA1, RB1 ) previously shown to be silenced in a variety of tumour types.
However, methylation percentages for these genes were generally higher in a group of NF2-
related meningiomas, with the exception of the BRCA1 gene. The NF2 gene was methylated
in only 1 of 21 tumours. In conclusion, meningiomas with an intact NF2 gene have a
normal karyotype and no obvious genetic or epigenetic aberrations, suggesting that the
gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumours are altered by smaller events than can
be detected with the techniques used in our study.

Introduction

Meningiomas originate from the meninges cover-
ing the central nervous system. Meningiomas com-
prise about 20% of all primary intracranial tumours.
Although generally a benign tumour, meningioma
often recurs and is malignant in 5–10% of all cases.
Meningiomas are amongst the best karyotyped human
tumours. Consistent cytogenetic changes have been
described, with loss of chromosome 22 being the
most prominent [1,2]. The NF2 gene is located on
this chromosome. NF2 is a tumour suppressor gene
involved in the hereditary condition neuroﬁbromatosis
(NF) type 2, which is also characterized by the growth
of meningiomas. In approximately 60% of the sporadic
meningiomas, the NF2 gene is inactivated by a small
mutation, and this is most frequently accompanied by
loss of the second allele, usually reﬂected by loss of

the entire chromosome 22 [3,4]. This correlation was
previously shown to be highly signiﬁcant, indicating
that loss of parts of chromosome 22 may be interpreted
as inactivation of the NF2 gene [5]. Cytogenetic and
molecular investigations have failed to detect either
aberrations of chromosome 22 or mutations in the NF2
gene in approximately 40% of sporadic meningiomas,
thus suggesting that an alternative pathogenetic mech-
anism is responsible for the development of these
tumours.

We previously showed that these NF2-intact menin-
giomas have, besides retention of chromosome 22,
some other common clinical and histopathologi-
they appear to have a normal
cal characteristics:
karyotype,
the syncytial
(meningothelial) type and they occur more often at
the anterior skull base [6,7]. The histological distinc-
tion was also made by Wellenreuther et al, and Evans

et al, who showed the absence of NF2 mutations
in meningothelial meningiomas [5,8]. To date, not
much is known about the genetic alterations in these
tumours. Using CGH analysis, the group of Duman-
ski suggested that candidate tumour suppressor regions
might be located on chromosome arms 1p and 3p.
However, the frequency of these alterations was low
[9]. The elucidation of the molecular pathway(s) that
may operate in the tumourigenesis of these tumours
is pivotal
in order to be able to develop strate-
gies for adjuvant treatment, for instance the use of
small molecule inhibitors, when complete resection
of the tumour cannot be achieved due to a difﬁ-
cult anatomical
location. Therefore, we performed
an intensive genetic screen to try and ﬁnd evi-
dence for the position of candidate tumour suppres-
sor genes for these tumours, including allelotyping, a
search for possible mitotic recombinations, methyla-
tion of promoter-associated CpG islands, analysis of
NF2-related genes of the ERM family and putative
microsatellite instability.

Materials & Methods

Patients and samples
A set of 25 meningiomas was selected based on the
retention of chromosome 22 as determined with a set
of 6 microsatellite markers as described previously
[6]. All markers were located near or in the NF2
gene on chromosome 22 (see below for names of the
markers used). Patient and tumour data are given in
Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 60 years.
Eight patients were male, the others female. Twenty
cases were graded I according to the World Health
Organization grading criteria [10]. Retention of the
NF2 region on chromosome 22 was conﬁrmed for
all
tumours (not shown). CT scans and/or MRIs
were retrieved for review of the tumour location
from the ﬁles of the Department of Neuroradiology
of the Erasmus MC. For methylation proﬁling, a
control group of 13 meningiomas that showed loss of
heterozygosity in the NF2 region was used.

Sample handling and
characterization
Use of tissues for scientiﬁc purposes was approved
by the institutional review board. The samples were
used according to the Code for proper secondary use
of human tissue in The Netherlands, as developed by
the Dutch Federation of Medical Scientiﬁc Societies
(FMWV) (version 2002).

DNA isolation
DNA was isolated from fresh or fresh frozen tumour
material by proteinase K digestion (20 mg/ml) in tis-
sue lysis buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, 10 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 0.4% SDS). Control DNA from the
same patient was isolated from peripheral blood

Allelotyping
196 markers were used for allelotyping. For each
chromosome arm, 3 markers were selected such that
they were spread out over the entire arm. In addi-
tion, we used 2–3 polymorphic markers for each
telomere. Markers were analysed with a radioiso-
tope or with a ﬂuorescent
label (HEX or FAM):
template DNA was ampliﬁed in a total volume of
15 µl reaction mixture containing 2.5 µM dNTPs,
10 pmol of the appropriate primer combination, (2.5
pmol when a ﬂuorochrome was attached) and 0.25
units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI).
Non-endlabeled primer products were labeled with α-
32P-dATP during cycling. Thermal cycling consisted

of initial denaturation at 95

rImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or
Genotyper software (licensed by Applied Biosystems,

when the ratio of the tumour alleles was lower than
0.6 or higher than 1.67 compared to the ratio in the
matching control DNA of the same patient [12,13].

Microsatellite instability
The presence or absence of microsatellite instability
was tested according to the international criteria for
the determination of microsatellite instability with the
markers BAT25, BAT40, D2S123, D5S346, MSH6
and BAT26, as described in Boland et al, [14]. PCR,
gel electrophoresis and detection were performed as
described for allelotyping.

Mutation analysis
Mutations in the coding region of the moesin gene
were determined by single strand conformation poly-
morphism (SSCP) analysis with the primers listed
in Table 2. During PCR, alpha 32P-dATP was incor-
porated and the radioactive products were separated
on 8% acryl : bisacryl (49 : 1) gels with 10% glycerol
in 1× TBE buffer (0.89M Tris, 0.89M Boric acid,
0.02M EDTA, pH 8.0). The gels were run at room

Methylation speciﬁc PCR
Aberrant DNA methylation in the CpG Island of the
genes NF2, RARβ, MGMT, DAPK, CDH1, p14ARF,
GSTP1, p15, VHL, p16INK4a, THBS1, CACNA1G,
BRCA1, APC, p73 and RB1 was determined by
chemical modiﬁcation of genomic DNA with sodium
bisulﬁte and followed by methylation-speciﬁc PCR.
The bisulﬁte modiﬁcation procedure was carried out
using the Intergen CpGenome DNA modiﬁcation kit
(Intergen, Purchase, NY). In brief, 1 µg of genomic
DNA was denatured by sodium hydroxide and then
chemically modiﬁed by sodium bisulﬁte for 20 hours.
The unmethylated cytosine was converted to uracil,
whereas methylated cytosine remains unchanged. The
modiﬁed DNA was recovered by ethanol precipita-
tion and resuspended in PCR-grade water. Primer
sequences were based on previous reports and are
listed in Table 3. One µl of bisulﬁte-modiﬁed DNA
was ampliﬁed in a total volume of 15 µl contain-
ing 1× PCR buffer (16.6 mM ammonium sulphate,
67 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6.7 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-
mercaptoethanol), 0.25 mM deoxynucleotide triphos-
phate, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Ampli-
C for 10 min.

µl of PCR product was loaded on 2% agarose gels
stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under
UV illumination. Samples were scored as methy-
lated when there was a clearly visible band on the
gel with the corresponding primers. Electrophoresis
results were interpreted by two independent investi-
gators. All experiments were repeated to ensure the
reproducibility of the results.

Results
Loss of heterozygosity is rare in non-NF2
meningiomas
To search for a common region of loss as an indication
for the location of a causative tumour suppressor
gene, a genome-wide allelotyping study with markers
covering all chromosome arms was performed on
25 meningiomas without evidence for loss of the
NF2 region. Very few LOH events were detected
with this approach. To make sure that no LOH
events were missed because an important gene is
located close to a telomere, we also screened the
tumour DNAs for LOH using polymorphic markers
located at sub-telomeric regions. Such an approach

should reveal all LOH events originating from the
two mechanisms most frequently observed in model
systems (mitotic recombination and loss followed
by reduplication). Again only very few LOH events
were found. In general, 30 LOH events appeared to
have arisen through terminal deletions/recombinations
(68%), while 14 events appeared to be interstitial,
with retention of chromosomal parts on both sides
of the LOH region. In four cases,
the LOH was
detected only with the sub-telomeric markers. In one
case, testing two different sub-telomeric markers for
one chromosome arm gave conﬂicting results: loss
for the ﬁrst and retention for the second marker.
The combined allelotyping results are presented in
Figure 1. In Figure 1a, the chromosome arms showing
loss are indicated per
tumour, and in
Figure 1b, the losses are quantiﬁed per chromosome
arm. The percentage loss found varied between zero
for chromosome arms 2q, 5p, 6, 8q, 9q, 10p, 11q, 16q,
17q, 20p and chromosomes 13, 18, 19 and 21, and
19% for chromosome arms 2p and 4q. In Figure 1c,
the percentage LOH for all markers per tumour is
presented. In Figure 1d, a schematic representation is
given of the regions of LOH on affected chromosomes.

Screening of the ERM family and other
meningioma-related genes suggests that these
genes are not involved
The NF2 protein is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin,
moesin) family of membrane-cytoskeleton linking pro-
teins [15]. The ezrin and radixin genes are located on
chromosome arms 6q25-26 and 11q23, respectively.
The DAL-1 gene (EPB41) is on chromosome arm 18p,
the protein 4.1R gene on chromosome arm 1p33-32
and the protein 4.1R interacting protein TSCL1 on

chromosome arm 11q23.2. No evidence for LOH of
these genes was obtained. None of the tumours showed
loss on chromosome arms 6q, 11q or 18p. Three
tumours (418, 430 and 448) showed loss on chromo-
some 1p, which could encompass the EPB41 gene.
The moesin gene is located on the X-chromosome.
Because both males and females have only one active
X chromosome, inactivation of a putative tumour sup-
pressor gene on this chromosome might occur pref-
erentially by a small genetic event that is difﬁcult to

detect by allelotyping. We therefore tested for possible
mutations in the moesin gene by screening all thirteen
exons for sequence variations in 22 NF2 intact menin-
giomas by SSCP. No tumour speciﬁc mutations were
found. No polymorphisms were detected. We therefore
conclude that it is unlikely that the ERM proteins and
other meningioma related genes are involved in the
pathogenesis of NF2 intact meningiomas.

NF2 intact meningiomas have a microsatellite
stable proﬁle

About 15% of all colorectal cancers have a normal
karyotype and LOH is also an uncommon ﬁnding
in these tumours. However, these tumour genomes
are highly unstable because of mutations in genes

involved in mismatch DNA repair. Mutations in mis-
match repair genes lead to a phenomenon called
microsatellite instability (MSI), which results in alter-
ations in the size of multiple microsatellite repeats
in the tumour genome. These DNA alterations are
thought to enhance the mutation frequency of rele-
vant cancer genes [16]. The BAT25, BAT40, MSH6,
D2S123, D5S346 and BAT26 microsatellites are com-
monly used to establish MSI in tumour samples. We
used these markers to analyse our set of 25 menin-
giomas for signs of MSI. The PCR products gener-
ated by these markers gave similar allele sizes for
tumour and blood DNA of the same patient (results not
shown). It therefore appears that meningioma tumours
without loss of the NF2 tumour suppressor gene do
not show any microsatellite instability.

Frequency of methylation in NF2 intact
meningiomas

Besides genetic alterations such as deletions, mitotic
recombinations and mutations,
tumour suppressor
genes can also be inactivated by epigenetic events
[17]. We therefore examined,
in addition to the
promotor region of the NF2 gene, 15 commonly
used genes for signs of CpG island hypermethyla-
tion in 21 specimens of NF2-intact meningiomas and
13 NF2-related tumours. DNA isolated from tumours
and peripheral blood from the same patients was

subjected to methylation-speciﬁc PCR. In general,
gene fragments tested were unmethylated, in blood
as well as in the tumours. Methylation of tumour
suppressor genes was found in 13 of 21 tumours
(62%). No methylation was found for
the genes
p73, p16 INK 4A, p15, MGM-T, DAPK, VHL, THBS1,
CACNA1G, APC, GSTP1 and RARb. The methyla-
tion frequencies for the remaining genes were as fol-
lows: NF2, 5%, p14 ARF , 19%; CDH1, 33%; BRCA1,
29%; RB1, 29% (Figure 2). Three patients had methy-
lation of three genes, ﬁve had methylation of two
genes, and four patients had one methylated gene.

In the matching blood samples, methylation was also
present at CDH1 (15%), GSTP1 (5%) and RB1 (42%).
We included a set of 13 NF2-related meningiomas.
Methylation of the p14 ARF (60%), CDH1 (100%), and
RB1 (46%) genes was also seen in the NF2-related
tumours. Furthermore, methylation of the p16 INK 4A
(60%), DAPK (15%) and GSTP1 (20%) genes was
exclusively seen in NF2-meningiomas. All other genes
were negative for methylation. In general, methyla-
tion was more frequent in NF2-related tumours. Only
methylation of the BRCA1 gene differed signiﬁcantly
between the two meningioma subtypes and control
blood.

Discussion

Meningiomas can be divided into at least two sub-
groups based on their genetic alterations. In about 60%
of the tumours, the NF2 tumour suppressor gene plays
a causative role. The current study was carried out
in order to provide information about the location of
possible candidate tumour suppressor genes that might
be involved in the NF2 intact meningiomas. Previ-
ously, we showed that these tumours mostly have a
normal karyotype and that they also differ from the
NF2-related tumours based on their intracranial loca-
tion and their histology [6]. We here show that these
NF2 intact meningiomas show few signs of genetic or
epigenetic aberrations.

We used genome-wide allelotyping to search for
common regions of loss. We also tested sub-telomeric
markers to visualize telomeric LOH events result-
ing from reduplication or mitotic recombination.
This approach was used before to identify the
RUNX1/AML1 gene as a tumour suppressor gene in
diploid cases of acute myeloid leukemia [18]. A low
frequency of loss was revealed with both allelotyp-
ing approaches, with LOH on a speciﬁc chromosome
arm in 19% or less of tumours. In 68% of LOH events,
the loss pattern included the telomere. Therefore, LOH
analysis at telomeric regions appears to be an effective
approach to identify chromosomes harboring critical
tumour suppressor genes. LOH has been used exten-
sively as a tool to gather information about the loca-
tion of tumour suppressor genes involved in speciﬁc
tumour types. However, it is pivotal to realize that
the frequency of LOH as the method of inactivation
for the second copy of a tumour suppressor gene can
vary between 70–95% for RB1 [19] and NF2 [20],
and 12.5–25% for APC [21]. For most genes, this
frequency is not known. In those cases where the pre-
ferred method of inactivation is not LOH, the location
of the gene will most likely not be detected with this
method.

The highest percentage of loss found in our series
of tumours was 19 for chromosome arms 2p and
4q. For chromosome arm 2p, however, 3 of the 4
tumours showing LOH did not share loss of the
same marker, which makes it unlikely that the same

gene was targeted. Although LOH of the chromosome
1p36 region is the second most common alteration
in meningiomas,
limited data exist on the role of
this region in NF2 intact tumours. In fact, it appears
more frequently altered in higher grade tumours [22],
supporting a role in progression. In a previous study
on NF2 intact meningiomas, Dumanski found that 2
out of 25 tumours had concurrent loss of 1p and 3q
[9]. In our series 1p was also targeted in 3 of 25
cases. Concurrent loss at chromosome arm 3q was
not seen. The region at chromosome arm 1p overlaps
the location of the protein 4.1R gene. In these three
tumours, protein 4.1R could be the target of deletion.
Loss of protein expression has been shown in 6 of 15
sporadic meningiomas [23].

Other frequently deleted genes in meningiomas
are EPB41L3 (DAL-1 ) at chromosome 18p11.32 and
TSLC1 at chromosome 11q23.2. However,
in our
series of NF2-intact meningiomas, no LOH was seen
in these regions, suggesting that these genes are not
major targets in the pathogenesis of this group.

Two tumours are remarkable because of their rel-
atively high frequency of LOH: cases 418 and 448
(Figure 1c). Both tumours were classiﬁed as belong-
ing to the NF2 intact group, however, they had LOH
on chromosome 22, but this was outside the NF2
gene region. We excluded the possibility that in these
tumours the gene is homozygously deleted on the basis
of the signal intensity of the labeled PCR products
for these markers, which was not signiﬁcantly lower
than other, adjacent, markers (not shown). It could
be that the LOH targets another gene adjacent to the
NF2 gene, as has been suggested for schwannomas
[24]. It is furthermore remarkable that both tumours
show rather similar LOH patterns: loss on chromo-
some 1p and q, 2q, 4p and q, and chromosome Xp.
Both are in fact more aggressive tumours (grade II
and III) and this suggests that these LOHs represent
secondary, progression steps. Progression has been
studied in NF2-related meningiomas, where LOH on
1p, 10q, 14q, 18q, and 9p was observed to be associ-
ated with higher grade and atypia [25,26]. Progression
in NF2 intact meningiomas may therefore proceed
through a different pattern. We conclude that kary-
otyping, comparative genomic hybridization and LOH
analysis show that loss of genomic information is rare
in NF2 intact meningiomas.

Moesin is a member of the ERM-family of pro-
teins from which merlin,
the product of the NF2
gene, derives its name. Other family members include
ezrin, radixin and protein 4.1. Physical
interaction
between ezrin and merlin has been shown [27]. It is
not unthinkable that the structural homology between
these proteins also indicates a functional homology.
Although ezrin has been shown to have a role in metas-
tasis suppression [28,29], so far no evidence exists to
implicate ezrin dysfunction in meningiomas. The role
of radixin in cancer is unknown. The gene encoding
moesin, MSN, is located on the X chromosome. Since
men have only one X chromosome, and women have

J Pathol 2006; 208: 564–573

572

AAG van Tilborg et al

only one active X chromosome, moesin could function
as a tumour suppressor gene by inactivation without
the need to lose the second copy of the gene. There-
fore, we wanted to exclude this possibility by mutation
analysis. No mutations or polymorphisms were found.
Thus, our data seem to exclude a role of the ERM
members in meningioma pathogenesis.

Microsatellite length instability (MSI), probably
resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair mech-
anisms, has been described in a variety of cancers.
Such genetic instability may play a signiﬁcant role
in tumour formation. In meningioma, several groups
studied MSI with conﬂicting results [30,31]. Here we
show that meningiomas not caused by inactivation of
NF2 have a microsatellite stable proﬁle. Therefore, we
conclude that this speciﬁc form of instability plays no
role in these tumours.

Besides inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene
by LOH, a speciﬁc gene can also be inactivated by
hypermethylation. Determining the methylation status
of this subset of meningiomas could therefore provide
clues whether this mechanism of gene inactivation
might play a role. Methylation as the method of inacti-
vation of NF2 in our series of tumours seems unlikely:
only 1 of the 21 studied tumours showed a weak signal
with methylation specifc primers. This seems to differ
from the ﬁndings of Lomas et al, [32], who found a
methylation frequency of 17% for meningiomas with-
out apparent NF2 involvement. They also found more
methylation in transitional meningiomas, and more
NF2 mutations in the meningothelial tumours. This
is in contrast with our previous ﬁndings and those of
Wellenreuther et al and Evans et al, showing that NF2
intact meningiomas are more often of the syncytial
(meningothelial) type [6,7] and are less likely to carry
NF2 mutations [5,8]. Methylation of CDH1, p14ARF
and p16INK 4A, and, to a lesser degree, RB1, was much
lower in NF2 intact tumours when compared to NF2-
related tumours (CDH1 : 33 vs. 100%, p14ARF: 19 vs.
60%, p16INK 4A: 0 vs. 60%, RB1 : 29 vs 46%). On the
contrary, methylation of BRCA1 was higher in NF2
intact meningiomas (29 vs 0%). Kirsch et al, studied
expression and LOH for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
in 60 meningiomas, but found no evidence of a role
for these genes in meningioma [33]. However, these
authors did not distinguish between NF2-related and
NF2 intact meningiomas. Thus, the possibility remains
that methylation of BRCA1 contributes towards devel-
opment of a subgroup of NF2 intact meningiomas. An
interesting ﬁnding was the high degree of methylation
of the cell cycle genes p14ARF , p16INK 4A and RB1 in
NF2-related meningiomas. Since the proteins encoded
by these genes are involved in the regulation of cell
cycle checkpoints, their absence might explain why
in these tumours, many more karyotypic abnormali-
ties are found. Loss of E-cadherin expression is in
many tumour types linked to tumour cell invasiveness
and metastatic potential [34,35]. In meningiomas, E-
cadherin expression has been studied with immunohis-
tochemistry only. Previously, Figarella-Branger et al

J Pathol 2006; 208: 564–573

suggested that E-cadherin expression is higher in
meningothelial tumours [36], which correlates well
with our ﬁndings that NF2 intact meningiomas, which
are more often of the meningothelial type, have a lower
methylation level of the E-cadherin gene (33%) than
NF2-related meningiomas (100%). The signiﬁcance
of this ﬁnding is, however, not clear at the moment
since meningiomas do not become invasive and do
not metastasize.

We conclude that NF2 intact meningiomas dif-
fer genetically from NF2-related meningiomas. Kary-
otyping, comparative genomic hybridization and LOH
analyses have shown that the genome of these tumours
is largely intact, that they display no MSI and that
methylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters is
not extensive. Calpain-dependent degradation could be
an option for these tumours, where activation of this
pathway does not have to coincide with LOH [37]. But
when we accept that all neoplasms develop through an
accumulation of genetic and/or epigenetic changes in
oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, at least three
possible explanations may explain our lack of suc-
cess. First, it is possible that these tumours develop
through inactivating mutations in different causative
genes with each gene contributing to a modest per-
centage of tumours, a second possibility is that the
inactivating mutations are too small to have been iden-
tiﬁed with the techniques used here or alternatively,
that NF2 intact meningiomas are caused by an onco-
gene, activated by a point mutation.
