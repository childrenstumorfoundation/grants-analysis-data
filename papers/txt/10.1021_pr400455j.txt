ABSTRACT: Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular
processes, and aberrant
function is often associated with
human disease. Consequently, kinases represent an important
class of therapeutic targets and about 20 kinase inhibitors
(KIs) are in clinical use today. Detailed knowledge about the
selectivity of KIs is important for the correct interpretation of
their pharmacological and systems biological eﬀects. Chemical
proteomic approaches for systematic kinase inhibitor selectiv-
ity proﬁling have emerged as important molecular tools in this regard, but the coverage of the human kinome is still incomplete.
Here, we describe a new aﬃnity probe targeting Akt and many other members of the AGC kinase family that considerably
extends the scope of KI proﬁling by chemical proteomics. In combination with the previously published kinobeads, the
synthesized probe was applied to selectivity proﬁling of the Akt inhibitors GSK690693 and GSK2141795 in human cancer cells.
The results conﬁrmed the inhibition of all Akt isoforms and of a number of known as well as CDC42BPB as a novel putative
target for GSK690693. This work also established, for the ﬁrst time, the kinase selectivity proﬁle of the clinical phase I drug
GSK2141795 and identiﬁed PRKG1 as a low nanomolar kinase target as well as the ATP-dependent 5′-3′ DNA helicase ERCC2
as a potential new non-kinase oﬀ-target.

■ INTRODUCTION

Protein kinases play a pivotal role in signal transduction and
therefore are attractive drug targets in diseases such as cancer
and inﬂammation.1−5 To date, about 20 small-molecule drugs
are approved for clinical use (all
in oncology) and several
hundred further compounds are under investigation in clinical
trials.6 Most of these agents exert their inhibitory eﬀects via
binding to the structurally highly conserved ATP-binding
pocket within the kinase domain. As a result, kinase inhibitors
(KIs) are likely to target multiple protein kinases or ATP-
hydrolyzing/binding enzymes, making the discovery of truly
selective inhibitors a formidable challenge. In a physiological
context, oﬀ-targets may lead to undesired side eﬀects but may
also increase the therapeutic potential of a drug. Hence,
determining an inhibitor’s full protein selectivity proﬁle is
important for the correct interpretation of its biological eﬀects
on a cellular and organismal
level. Traditional methods to
assess the selectivity of kinase inhibitors are based on in vitro
kinase activity assays using large panels of
recombinant
kinases.7−9 Despite being powerful and widely used, these
panels have shortcomings: notably,
they mostly utilize an
exogenously expressed catalytic kinase domain, thus ignoring
regulatory sequence elements present in the full-length protein,
activity-regulating posttranslational modiﬁcations, and the
inﬂuence of further proteins and cofactors present in cells.10,11

To complement such in vitro assays, aﬃnity-based chemical
proteomic methods have been developed to allow for a more
unbiased analysis of a drug’s potential to interact with kinases
or other cellular proteins. One such successful approach makes
use of
immobilized low-selectivity kinase inhibitors for the
speciﬁc enrichment of a large subset of the native kinome and
other nucleotide binding proteins directly from cell or tissue
extracts of biological signiﬁcance (exempliﬁed by the kinobead
technology).12−16 Kinobeads enable diﬀerential proﬁling of
kinase expression in cells and tissues and, when conﬁgured as a
competition binding assay in conjunction with quantitative
mass spectrometry, allow for determination of the selectivity of
a small-molecule kinase inhibitor against hundreds of proteins
in a single experiment.17−20 Despite conceptual advantages,
chemical proteomic methods also have shortcomings, notably
incomplete coverage of the kinome. For example, the published
kinobead method,12 which uses a mixture of seven immobilized
kinase inhibitors, does not eﬀectively address Akt kinases due to
the lack of suitable aﬃnity probes. The serine/threonine kinase
Akt, also known as protein kinase B, belongs to the AGC
subfamily of protein kinases and is a key mediator of cell
growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.21,22 Aberrant activation of

the Akt pathway has been identiﬁed in a wide variety of human
cancers including tumors of the breast, prostate, ovaries, and
skin.23−26 Therefore,
inhibiting Akt activity is viewed as an
attractive therapeutic approach, and several small-molecule
inhibitors targeting this enzyme have been reported and are
being tested in the clinic.27−29 Given the above shortcomings,
we sought to develop a chemical aﬃnity probe targeting Akt
and structurally related kinases in order to expand the kinome
coverage of kinobeads. This was achieved by retroengineering
the potent and reasonably selective Akt inhibitor GSK69069327
into a broad kinase binder. In combination with the previous
version of kinobeads,
the new Akt probe enabled us to
determine the selectivity proﬁle of the ATP-competitive Akt
inhibitors GSK690693 and GSK214179530 and to identify a
number of oﬀ-targets that may be responsible for desired and
undesired biological eﬀects.

■ MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemical Synthesis
Synthetic schemes, detailed procedures, and characterization of
synthesized compounds can be found in the Supporting
Information.
Sample Preparation
Postdelivery human placenta tissue (obtained from Freising
hospital following informed consent) was thoroughly washed
with cold phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) and homogenized in
lysis buﬀer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.8% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and
25 mM NaF with freshly added protease inhibitors and
phosphatase inhibitors) by use of a tissue grinder. Lysates were
incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and protein extracts were clariﬁed
by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 145000g at 4 °C. Protein
concentration was determined by the Bradford method.

K562 and COLO205 cells were cultured in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI 1640) medium, SKNBE2 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), and OVCAR8 cells were cultured in Iscove’s
modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM), all supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were cultured in
humidiﬁed air supplemented with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were
washed with cold PBS and harvested by lysis in 50 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.8%
NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 25 mM NaF with freshly
added protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (5×
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1, Sigma−Aldrich, Munich,
Germany; 5× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2, Sigma−Aldrich,
Munich, Germany; 1 mM Na3VO4; and 20 nM calyculin A, LC
Laboratories, Woburn, MA). Protein extracts were clariﬁed by
ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 145000g at 4 °C, and protein
concentration was determined by the Bradford method.
Compound Coupling
Compounds were immobilized on Sepharose beads through
covalent linkage via primary amino (compound) and carboxyl
groups as described previously.12 One milliliter of N-
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated Sepharose (GE Health-
care, Freiburg, Germany) and the compound (2 μmol/mL)
were equilibrated in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Triethyl-
amine (15 μL) was added to start the coupling reaction, and
the mixture was incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 16−
20 h in the dark. Free NHS groups on the beads were blocked
by adding 50 μL of aminoethanol and the mixture was

incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 16−20 h in the dark.
Coupled beads were washed and stored in 2-propanol at 4 °C
in the dark. The coupling reaction was monitored by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Compound Deprotection
Sepharose beads (2 μmol/mL; 1 mL) functionalized with o-
nitrobenzenesulfonyl (o-Nbs) protected compound were
washed and equilibrated in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).
For the deprotection reaction, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP,
2 mL), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 1.5 mL), and
mercaptoethanol (1.5 mL) were added and the mixture was
incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 15 min at room
temperature. Subsequently, beads were washed and stored in 2-
propanol at 4 °C in the dark.
Aﬃnity Puriﬁcation
Akt probe and kinobead pulldowns were performed as
described previously.12 Brieﬂy,
lysates of a cell mix were
diluted with equal volumes of 1× compound pulldown (CP)
buﬀer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
150 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and freshly
added protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (5×
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1, Sigma−Aldrich, Munich,
Germany; 5× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2, Sigma−Aldrich,
Munich, Germany; 1 mM sodium orthovanadate; and 20 nM
calyculin A, LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA)]. If necessary,
lysates were further diluted to a ﬁnal protein concentration of 5
mg/mL in 1× CP buﬀer supplemented with 0.4% NP-40.

For selectivity proﬁling experiments, the lysates (5 mg of
total protein each) were preincubated with 0 (DMSO control),
2.5 nM, 25 nM, 250 nM, 2.5 μM or 25 μM free compound
(GSK690693 or GSK2141795) on an end-over-end shaker for
45 min at 4 °C. Subsequently,
lysates were incubated with
beads (coupled Akt probe or kinobeads) for 1 h at 4 °C, for
both qualitative and quantitative experiments. The beads were
washed with 1× CP buﬀer and collected by centrifugation.
Bound proteins were eluted with 2× NuPAGE LDS sample
buﬀer (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany), and eluates were
reduced and alkylated by 50 mM dithiothreitol and 55 mM
iodoacetamide.
Samples were then run into a 4−12% NuPAGE gel
(Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) for about 0.5 cm to
concentrate the sample prior to in-gel tryptic digestion, which
was performed according to standard procedures.
Liquid Chromatography−Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Measurements
Nanoﬂow LC-MS/MS was performed by coupling an Eksigent
nanoLC-Ultra 1D+ (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) to a LTQ-Orbitrap
XL ETD (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany). Peptides
were delivered to a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, packed in-
house with Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 5 μm resin; Dr. Maisch,
Ammerbuch, Germany) at a ﬂow rate of 5 μL/min in 100%
solvent A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water). After 10
min of loading and washing, peptides were transferred to an
analytical column (75 μm × 40 cm, packed in-house with
Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ, 3 μm resin; Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch,
Germany) and separated via a 210 min gradient from 7% to
35% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at 300 nL/min
ﬂow rate. The LTQ Orbitrap XL was operated in data-
dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and
MS2. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at
60 000 (m/z 400) resolution after accumulation to a target

value of 1 000 000. Internal calibration was performed by use of
the ion signal [Si(CH3)2O]6H+ at m/z 445.120 025 present in
ambient laboratory air. Tandem mass spectra were generated
for up to eight peptide precursors in the linear ion trap for
fragment by using collision-induced dissociation at a
normalized collision energy of 35% after accumulation to a
target value of 5000 for a maximum of 500 ms.

Measurements using the Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Bremen, Germany) employed the same LC conditions as
described and similar data acquisition parameters. Full-scan MS
spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at 30 000 resolution.
Tandem mass spectra were generated for up to 15 peptide
precursors for fragment by using higher energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) at normalized collision energy of 30% and
a resolution of 15 000 with a target value of 100 000 charges
after accumulation for a maximum of 100 ms.
Peptide and Protein Identiﬁcation and Quantiﬁcation
For qualitative analysis, raw MS data ﬁles were converted to
peak lists by use of Mascot Distiller (version 2.3.0, Matrix
Science, London) and searched against the IPI human database
(version 3.68; 87 061 sequences) by use of the Mascot search
engine (version 2.3.0, Matrix Science, London) and the
following parameters: precursor tolerance 10 ppm, fragment
tolerance 0.6 Da, full tryptic speciﬁcity with up to two missed
cleavage sites, and misassignment of the monoisotopic peak to
the ﬁrst 13C peak, ﬁxed modiﬁcation of carbamidomethylation
of cysteine residues, and variable modiﬁcation of methionine

oxidation. The database search results were imported into
Scaﬀold (version 3.6.2, Proteome Software, Portland, OR) for
further evaluation.

Quantitative analysis with intensity-based label-free quanti-
ﬁcation was performed by the Progenesis software (version 3.1,
Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, U.K.) Brieﬂy, after one sample
was selected as a reference, the retention times of all eluting
precursor m/z values in all other samples within the experiment
were aligned, creating a large list of “features” representing the
same peptide in each sample. Features with 2−5 charges were
included for further analysis. Features with two or less isotopes
were excluded. After alignment and feature ﬁltering, replicate
samples were grouped together, and raw abundances of all
features were normalized to determine a global scaling factor
for correcting experimental variation such as diﬀerences in the
quantity of protein loaded into the instrument. Brieﬂy, for each
sample, one unique factor is calculated and used to correct all
features in the sample for experimental variation according to
Hauck et al.31 MS/MS spectra were transformed into peak lists
and exported to generate Mascot generic ﬁles. The Mascot
generic ﬁles were searched against
the protein sequence
database IPI human (version 3.68; 87 061 sequences) by use
of Mascot (version 2.3.0, Matrix Science, London). Search
parameters were as follows: precursor
tolerance 10 ppm,
fragment tolerance 0.02 Da, full tryptic speciﬁcity with up to
two missed cleavage sites, misassignment of the monoisotopic
peak to the ﬁrst 13C peak, ﬁxed modiﬁcation of carbamidome-

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Design and Synthesis of Aﬃnity Probes Targeting Akt and
AGC Family Kinases
The potent ATP-competitive Akt inhibitor GSK690693 (Figure
1A) was chosen as starting point for the design of chemical
aﬃnity probes, as this compound inhibits all three isoforms of
Akt (1, 2, and 3) at low nanomolar concentrations and further
shows potent activity against a number of AGC family members
as well as other protein kinases.27 For aﬃnity probes intended
for KI selectivity proﬁling, low kinase selectivity (but potent
binding) is desirable in order to enable the measurement of
many kinases simultaneously. We therefore explored the merits
of three linkable compounds (Figure 1A): probe 1 corresponds
to the parental compound. which can be immobilized via its
secondary amine. Considerations leading to the design and
synthesis of probes 2 and 3 (see Supporting Information for

details) were based on the cocrystal structure of GSK690693
and the kinase domain of Akt2 (PDB code 3DOE; Figure S1,
Supporting Information) as well as the described structure−
activity relationship (SAR) of GSK690693.27 The inhibitor
occupies the ATP binding pocket with the 1,2,5-oxidazole
moiety located in the hinge region. Several
inter- and
intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the 1,2,5-oxidazole and the
imidazopyridine ring, together with hydrophobic interactions
with the glycine-rich loop, provide strong interactions between
kinase and inhibitor. Furthermore, the alkynol group at position
C4 of the imidazopyridine core is located in the back cleft
pocket and improves potency for Akt and,
importantly,
selectivity against other kinases of the AGC family.27 The
piperidinyl side chain is exposed to the solvent and also
provides hydrogen bonding to the carboxylic acid side chain of
Glu 236 in the substrate binding area of Akt. This feature makes
this side of the molecule attractive for modiﬁcation with a
linker, provided that the basicity of the amino group can be
kept intact. Structural and SAR information together would
predict that probe 3 should be more selective for Akt than
probe 2.
Protein Binding Proﬁles of Akt Probes

The protein binding proﬁles of
compounds (probes 1, 2, and 3) were assessed in pulldown
experiments on lysates of human placenta, followed by mass
spectrometry for protein identiﬁcation. A triplicate analysis
resulted in the identiﬁcation of 204 proteins (six kinases) for
probe 1, 347 proteins (50 kinases) for probe 2, and 458

proteins (11 kinases) for probe 3 (see Table 1 for kinases and
Table S1, Supporting Information, for all proteins). This clearly
identiﬁed probe 2 as the most eﬀective kinase binder, and in
fact the only one capable of capturing all three isoforms of Akt.
Visualization of the identiﬁed kinases on the phylogenetic
kinome tree (Figure 1B) revealed that probe 2 captures a
considerable number of
further AGC kinases as well as
members of the CMGC and CAMK kinase families. The
broad kinase binding proﬁle can be rationalized (i) by the high
structural conservation of the kinase domain and ATP binding
pocket within the AGC family and (ii) by the removal of the
alkynol moiety, which was previously shown to improve
selectivity, for example, against ROCK and RSK.27 Probes 1
and 3 were ineﬀective in capturing Akt and also captured only a
few other kinases. This may not be surprising for probe 1, as
the basicity of the secondary amine of the piperidinyl side chain
present in GSK690693 and important for Akt binding is not
preserved in the immobilized conﬁguration. The fairly low
degree of kinase binding may be rationalized by the rather short
and bulky group attaching the compounds to the beads, which
may prevent the molecule from reaching deep enough into the
ATP binding pocket. This argument does not apply for probe 3,
as its linker is the same as that of probe 2. Instead, it is possible
that the functional alkynol group cannot eﬃciently penetrate
the very narrow opening into the back pocket of the ATP
binding site of kinases, so that even small conformational

changes in the compound and/or the native, full-length protein
structure might considerably impair proper binding.
is
noteworthy, though, that probe 3 appears to be an eﬀective
binder for the phosphatidylinositol kinase PI4KA, a lipid kinase
that has recently been implicated in hepatitis C replication in
human cells.32

It

Apart from kinases, the three probes bind to multiple other
proteins. This is not unusual: proteins may bind unspeciﬁcally
to the beads, but also the immobilized KIs are ATP mimetics
that have the potential to bind nucleotide binding proteins, of
which there are many hundreds in mammalian cells. Gene
ontology (GO) analysis of the identiﬁed proteins (Figure S2,
Supporting Information) reveals that all probes do bind a
considerable number of these proteins as well as further RNA/
DNA binding proteins. When the number of unique tandem
mass spectra of identiﬁed proteins is used as a semiquantitative
measure for protein abundance, it can be noted that about two-
thirds of
the total proteins binding to probe 2 can be
rationalized by one of the aforementioned GO categories. In
contrast,
less than one-third of these proteins explain the
binding proﬁles of probes 1 and 3.

Having established that probe 2 is an eﬀective aﬃnity tool for
capturing protein kinases, notably of the AGC branch, we next
investigated whether the probe would extend the kinome
coverage of kinobeads as published by Bantscheﬀ et al.12 For
this purpose, we performed pulldown experiments (in

kinobeads as published (seven immobilized compounds,
KBα) or kinobeads supplemented with probe 2 (KBβ). In
pulldowns with KBα, 130 kinases (total of 860 proteins; Figure
2; Figures S3 and S4 and Table S3, Supporting Information)
were identiﬁed and KBβ pulldown experiments led to the
identiﬁcation of 139 kinases out of a total of 815 proteins. As
expected, more than 80% of the protein kinases were identiﬁed
in both experiments. Twenty-three kinases (15 from the AGC
family) were exclusively found in the KBβ experiment (Figure
S3B,C, Supporting Information), and members of the AGC
family were present in signiﬁcantly higher amounts on KBβ
compared to KBα (Figure S4 and Table S2, Supporting
Information). The 14 kinases exclusively identiﬁed on KBα
originate from many diﬀerent areas of the kinome tree and
these hits were mostly identiﬁed with few spectra (Table S2,
Supporting Information), thus representing kinases with either
low aﬃnity to the kinobeads or kinases of very low abundance
in the sample. Taken together, probe 2 both qualitatively and
quantitatively adds to the published version of kinobeads, which
is why this chemical aﬃnity tool was used for all subsequent
experiments.

Kinase Inhibitor Selectivity Proﬁle
To demonstrate the utility of the new kinobeads KBβ, we
inhibitors GSK69069333−35 (phase I,
subjected the Akt
terminated) and GSK214179530 (active phase I
trials in
patients with solid tumors or lymphomas) to kinase selectivity
proﬁling in mixed lysates of four cancer cells (see Materials and
Methods section). Brieﬂy, KBβ pulldowns were performed after
preincubation of separate lysates with increasing concentrations
of the respective drug. Protein targets that bind the drug in the
lysate show a dose-dependent reduction in binding to the
kinobeads, while proteins unaﬀected by the drug show no
reduction in binding. Proteins were eluted from kinobeads,
digested with trypsin into peptides, and analyzed by liquid
chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).36
Following protein identiﬁcation by database searching, proteins
were quantiﬁed by use of their LC-MS/MS intensities, and
dose−response curves were generated from the resulting data
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). The results of these
experiments show clear similarities as well as diﬀerences in the
selectivity proﬁles of the two compounds. Both expectedly
show inhibition of Akt1 and 2 (Figure 3A,B and Table 2; Akt3
was detected only in assays with GSK2141795), and IC50 values

aAs determined by the kinobead competition binding assay.

of 138 nM (Akt1) and 128 nM (Akt2) were determined for
GSK690693. GSK2141795 inhibited kinobead binding with
IC50 values of 180 nM for Akt1, 328 nM for Akt2, and 38 nM
for Akt3 (Table 2). We note here that IC50 values for target
aﬃnities determined in such competition binding assays are
often aﬀected by the partial depletion of
individual target
proteins from the lysate. This can be compensated for by
calculating a target-speciﬁc KD value using a correction factor
derived from the Cheng−Prusoﬀ equation.16,37 This results in
KD values of 16 nM for Akt1, 49 nM for Akt2, and 5 nM for
Akt3 (for GSK2141795), which are in line with literature data
from biochemical assays that report potencies of 2 nM for Akt1,
2−13 nM for Akt2, and 3−9 nM Akt3 for GSK690693.7,27,34
We further note that compound potencies determined by
kinobead assays are often weaker than those obtained from
biochemical kinase assays. We attribute this to fundamental
diﬀerences in assay conditions: in vitro kinase assays generally
measure isolated recombinant kinase domains, while the
kinobead assay measures full-length native kinases expressed
in cell lines or tissues. In addition, the respective lysates contain
other cellular proteins and cofactors not present in recombinant
assays that might regulate kinase activity or otherwise interfere
with or bind to the free compound (e.g., acting as a compound
sink).

IC50 values,

Apart from Akt, the proﬁle of GSK690693 contains 13
further kinases with submicromolar
in sharp
contrast to GSK2141795, for which only four such cases are
detected (Figure 3C and Table 2). The selectivity of
GSK690693 toward kinases has been studied before,7,27,34
documenting low-
to midnanomolar binding constants for
members of the protein kinase A (13−24 nM) and protein
kinase C (2−250 nM) family of proteins, GSK3a (5200 nM)
and GSK3b (100−140 nM), ROCK1 (280−890 nM) and
ROCK2 (200 nM), MARK2 (720 nM), and RPS6KA4 (51
nM) as well as PAK4 (10−18 nM). These targets are also
found in the kinobead assay with binding inhibition values

between 15 and 340 nM. In addition to these previously known
targets, our assay revealed binding inhibition of CDC42BPB
(also known as MRCKB, IC50 = 550 nM). Interestingly, the
kinase domain of MRCKB resembles that of PAK kinases and it
is thus likely that MRCKB constitutes a novel
target of
GSK690693. Taken together, the selectivity proﬁle of this
compound is fairly broad and the particular kinases inhibited
should help in understanding the cellular action of
the
molecule. While anticancer activity of the compound may be
rationalized based on several of the inhibited kinases, each
playing a role in various types of cancer (e.g., Akt,21−26
PKC,38−40 ROCK,41 PAK,42 MRCKB43),
the inhibition of
other kinases in the target spectrum may be more problematic.
For example, potent inhibition of GSK3 might be a double-
edged sword. On the one hand, GSK3 activity has been linked
to cancer;44,45 on the other hand,
in concert with Akt and
mTOR, GSK3 is an important mediator of the insulin pathway
and its inhibition may lead to impaired glucose uptake, induce
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance.46
Similarly, PKA signaling pathways are active in many cell types
and mediate a wide spectrum of normal biological functions. If
and how pharmacological PKA inhibition might be beneﬁcial
for treating cancer or detrimental for normal cells is therefore
not necessarily clear.47,48

Judged from the kinobead selectivity proﬁle,

the target
spectrum of GSK2141795 appears to be much narrower than
that of GSK690693. Apart from the Akts, only the PKC family
members PRKACA and PRKACB as well as the cGMP-
dependent protein kinase PRKG1 are potently inhibited (Table
2). The much tighter selectivity proﬁle of GSK2141795 is likely
beneﬁcial, as some of the potential biological toxicity issues
might be circumvented. Still, while the inhibition of PKCs may
contribute to the anticancer eﬀects of this compound, the
physiological consequences of the very potent inhibition (IC50
= 2.5 nM, Kd = 0.05 nM) of PRKG1 cannot be clearly
anticipated at present. This kinase is a key mediator of a
plethora of normal cellular and organ functions such as
modulation of cellular calcium, platelet activation, smooth
muscle contraction, axonal guidance, and learning, to name a
few,49−52 which on their own or in combination might indicate
toxic side eﬀects. However, results of ongoing phase I clinical
trials have not been reported thus far, referring any such
considerations into the realm of speculation at the present time.
Given that kinobeads not only bind kinases and other
nucleotide binding proteins but also capture binding proteins
from cell lysates under denaturing conditions, one frequently
observes non-kinase targets and copuriﬁcation of interacting
proteins in competition binding experiments (Figure S6,
spectrin α1
Supporting Information). For example,
(SPTAN1) shows a dose-dependent reduction in binding to
kinobeads. This protein contains an SH3 domain, suggesting
that it might copurify with a phosphorylated kinase that itself is
inhibited by GSK2141795. The ATP-dependent 5′-3′ DNA
helicase ERCC2 also shows a dose-dependent reduction of
kinobead binding in response to drug treatment. Given the
ATP-hydrolyzing activity of this enzyme, which is involved in
nucleotide excision repair
is
tempting to speculate that it might be a non-kinase oﬀ-target
of GSK2141795. How this might impact the phenotype of cells
treated with the compound remains to be investigated.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we describe a novel chemical aﬃnity probe for
capturing Akt isoforms and about 50 further kinases, primarily
from the AGC branch of the kinome phylogenetic tree. This
not only increases the range of kinases that can be assayed by
the established kinobead technology but also substantially
reduces the bias of kinobeads toward the representation of
tyrosine and tyrosine-like kinases. Application of
the new
probes to the selectivity proﬁling of Akt kinase inhibitors
conﬁrmed the broad selectivity of GSK690693 and, for the ﬁrst
time, established the much narrower proﬁle of GSK2141795,
generating new hypotheses as to how this clinical Akt inhibitor
exerts its cellular eﬀects. Our work shows that retroengineering
kinase inhibitors into broad kinase binders works, and it is
entirely feasible to apply the same or a similar strategy to other
kinase families should reasonable chemical starting points exist.
In fact, we are currently in the process of generating probes
targeting kinases of the VEGFR and FGFR families, which are
not well addressed by existing probes. In light of the current
chemoproteomic literature,37,53,54 it is unlikely that a single true
pan-kinase compound probe can be developed, but continuing
eﬀorts by ourselves and others in the ﬁeld5,55 will
likely
eventually ﬁll the remaining gaps.
