Biochemical Assay Protocol:  For a biochemical measurement of MEK1 inhibitory 
activity compounds were studied in a triple coupled cRaf-MEK1-ERK2 assay using 
AlphaScreen technology (Perkin Elmer).  The compound prepared as a 10 M DMSO 
stock solution, is serial diluted into an assay buffer composed of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 
mM magnesium chloride, 0.03% CHAPS and 1 mM DTT.  Subsequently, 10 L of 
substrate mixture is added composed of unactive MEK1 (3 nM), ATP (50 M), unactive 
ERK2 (4 nM), biotinylated MBP peptide (b-FFKNIVTPRTPPPSQGK, 1 M) and 
antiphospho MBP peptide (0.5 nM).  The mixture is then gently shaken for 30 minutes at 
room temperature followed by addition of active cRaf (5 L at 0.5 nM) to initiate 
reaction.  The mixture is then shaken for 100 minutes at room temperature then quenched 
by addition of 10 L of a mixture of 5g/mL streptavidin donor beads and 5g/mL 
protein A acceptor beads in detection buffer (75 mM Hepes pH = 7.5, 300 mM sodium 
chloride, 120 mM EDTA, 0.3% BSA and 0.03% Tween), followed by incubation 
overnight and signal detection on an AlphaQuest plate reader (Perkin Elmer).  IC50 values 
reported are the average of a minimum of two independent determinations.

Cellular Assay Protocol:  Cellular activity was determined using MDA-MB-231T cells 
in an endogenous ERK phosphorylation ELISA assay.  MDA-MB-231T (ATCC) cells 
were plated at a density of 20000 cells/well onto 96-well microtiter plates (Costar), in 
DMEM (Cellgro) containing 10% FBS (heat-inactivated, Cellgro), and 1% Pen/Strep 
(Cellgro).  The cells were incubated at 37oC , 5% CO2 for 24 hr.  Serum starvation was 
performed by replacing the medium with serum-free DMEM or MEM for an additional 
24 hr.  Serial dilutions of test compound in fresh serum-free medium in a final 
concentration of 0.3% DMSO (vehicle) were added to the cells and incubated for 1 hr.  
Negative controls were in serum-free medium + 0.3% DMSO only.  After treatment, the 
cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, followed by quenching of endogenous 
peroxidases with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide.  Plates were then blocked (10% FBS, Cellgro) 
and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, E10 (1:2000, Cell 

 

23

Signaling), followed by secondary antibody (HRP-conguated, goat anti-mouse IgE, 
1:3000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc).  Washing of the plates was 
performed with PBS-T (0.1% Triton X-100) in between all incubation steps.  A luminol-
based substrate solution was then added and plates were read using the Victor Wallac 
machine.  IC50 values were determined based on total ERK phosphorylation with 
compound treatment versus total ERK phosphorylation with 0.3% DMSO treatment 
alone. 
 
In Vivo Studies: 
 
Experimental Animals:  Female CD rats (Sprauge Dawley) approximately 9-10 weeks 
of age and weighing approximately 201-225 grams were purchased from Charles River 
Laboratories.  For pharmacokinetic studies the animals were fasted overnight prior to 
compound dosing and returned to food four hours post compound administration.  
Female nude mice (NCr) 5-8 weeks of age and weighing approximately 20 grams were 
purchased from Taconic.  Prior to initiation of a study, the animals were allowed to 
acclimate for 48 hours.  During studies the animals were provided food and water ad 
libitum and all animals were housed in a room conditioned at 70-75oC and 60% relative 
humidity.  A twelve hour light and dark cycle was maintained with automatic timers.  
 
 Rat Pharmacokinetics:  All compounds were dosed at 5 mg/kg by both oral and IV 
administration.  Experimental groups were comprised of three animals for each 
compound and dosing route.  Blood was collected (100 L) in heparinized tubes via a 
jugular catheter at timepoints 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours.  The plasma obtained was 
stored at -80oC and a volume of 50 L was used for analytics.  The concentration of 
compound was determined by HPLC/MS/MS analysis using a PE Sciex API-4000 
MS/MS integrated with a Shimadzu LC-10AD, Leap HTS-PAL autosampler using 
Analyst 1.3 system software.  An Eclipse XDB-C18, 50x4.6 mm Agilent column was 
employed for sample separation.  The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid 
buffered aqueous acetonitrile.  Samples for analysis were prepared by combination of the 
plasma aliquot (50 L) with a 100L volume of internal standard solution.  Following 
vortex mixing and centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter 

 

24

plate and a 20 L sample was evaluated for compound concentration.  A non-
compartmental model was applied to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters for all routes 
of administration using WinNonlin 4.1 software. 
 
Pharmacodynamic Studies:  MDA-MB-231T human breast adenocarcinoma cells were 
cultured in vitro in DMEM (Mediatach) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 
Penicillin-Streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids at 37oC in a humidified, 5% CO2 
atmosphere.  On day zero, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and 1x106 cells in 0.1 
mL ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution were implanted subcutaneously into the 
animal mammary fat pad.  A transponder was implanted in each mouse for identification 
and all animals were monitored daily for clinical symptoms and survival.  For 2, 8 and 24 
h dose-response/duration of action studies, whole blood was sampled at determined times 
post dose by cardiac puncture. The plasma concentrations of parent compound and the 
metabolite (4) were analyzed.  After CO2 euthanasia, tumors and brains from the animals 
corresponding to the 2, 8 and 24 h post single dose time point were harvested, minced 
and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% 
NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium 
pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 
10 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and 5 mg/ml pepstatin A). Tumors and brains 
were homogenized using a Polytron PT 10/35-homogenizer (Brinkmann); a fraction of 
the crude lysate was saved to be analyzed by LC/MS/MS for tumor and brain parent 
compound and metabolite (4) concentrations, while the rest was centrifuged at 12,000 
rpm for 14 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants (clarified lysates) were separated and stored at –
80°C until assayed for individual target modulation.  Protein concentrations in the tumor 
and brain lysates were measured by BCA method (Pierce). Lysates (25 µg) were mixed 
with 4x NuPage LDS buffer and reducing reagent. Samples were then heated at 85°C for 
10 min. 20-40 µg protein was loaded onto NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris gels. Proteins were 
transferred to PVDF membranes and blotted overnight with anti-MEK1 (Cat# 9124, Cell 
Signaling), anti-pMEK (Ser217/221), (Cat# 9121, Cell Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell 
Signaling) and anti-pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed 3 times for 15 
min each with TBS-T buffer and blotted with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham) 

 

25

or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham) antibody in 5% non-fat milk for 60 min. 
Membranes were probed with ECL-Plus (Amersham) for 5 min at room temperature and 
quantitated after scanning using the Typhoon 9400. The ratio of phosphorylation and 
total MEK and ERK were calculated by the ImageQuant program, and the percentage of 
compound inhibition was normalized to the vehicle control. 
 
Efficacy Studies:  The effects of compounds on tumor growth were determined in 
female athymice nude mice bearing established MDA-MB-231 tumors. The tumors were 
staged at an average size of 92 ± 4 mg, at which time they were randomized into 
treatment groups, each containing 10 mice. A transponder was implanted into each mouse 
for identification and data tracking, and animals were monitored daily for clinical 
symptoms and survival.  Compounds were administered at the dosing regimens 
summarized.  No significant loss of body weight was observed during the study.  During 
the dosing period, the tumor weight of each animal was determined twice weekly and the 
body weight of each animal was measured daily. Tumor weight (TW) was determined by 
measuring perpendicular diameters with a caliper, using the following formula: 

TW (mg) = [tumor volume = length (mm) x width2 (mm2)]/2 

These data were recorded for tumors in each experimental group and group mean ± SEM 
values were determined and plotted on a tumor weight vs. days post-implantation line 
graph to display tumor growth rates. Percent inhibition of tumor growth from size at 
staging relative to the average growth of the vehicle group (TGI) is determined with the 
following formula: 

 

 

1 –  

 ( Xf – X0 ) 

 * 100 

 ( Yf – X0 )  

where  X0 = average TW of all tumors on day of staging/grouping 

Xf = average TW of tumors from treatment group on Day f 

26

Yf = average TW of vehicle control group tumors on Day f 

Statistical significance was determined using the 2-tailed Student’s t-test (significance 
defined as p < 0.05).

MEK1:AMP-PCP Co-Crystal Structure Determinations: 
 
Crystallization:  Crystals were grown at 10oC in sitting drops using vapor diffusion.  
MEK1 at 8 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% 
glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 3% DMSO was incubated with 300mM compound for two 
hours on ice.  Subsequently, adenosine 5’-(,-methylenetriphosphonate) (AMP-PCP) 
was added to a final concentration of 2.8 mM and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 7 
mM.  Crystals of the ternary complex were obtained by mixing 1.2 L of this stock 
solution with 1.8 L of a reservoir solution consisting of 25.5% PEG-2000 MME, 0.1 M 
trimethyleneamine N-oxide, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.9).  Crystals were grown to full size in 
approximately 1-3 weeks.  As required crystals were soaked for 5 hours in a solution 
consisting of the reservoir solution supplemented with 400 mM compound , 0.1 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM AMP-PCP, and 2.5 mM MgCl2 to ensure optimal occupancy.  Crystals were 
then transferred to a cryoprotectant and subsequently flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. 
 
Data Collection and Refinement:  Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K at 
the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and measured on a Quantum 210 ADSC area detector.  
Data were collected using 1.0o scans in with an exposure time of 10 s per image.  The 
crystal to detector distance was 190 mm.  Diffraction data were integrated with 
MOSFLM version 6.2.4 and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite, version 5.0.2.  
The structure of the MEK1:AMP-PCP:compound ternary complex was solved by 
molecular replacement using all protein atoms of a previously solved structure as a search 
model.  A single unambiguous solution was found using MOLREP, with one molecule in 
the asymmetric unit.  The resulting model was subsequently refined in REFMAC5 using 
rigid body and maximum likelihood procedures.  At this stage fourier syntheses yielded 
clearly interpretable electron density for all atoms and ligand.  The ligand was built and 
minimized in Chem3D, imported into QUANTA/X-Ligand, and fit into the difference 
electron density.  The complex was subsequently refined using maximum likelihood 
procedures in REFMAC5.  Portions of the protein were adjusted by iterative cycles of 
manual rebuilding in QUANTA and refinement in REFMAC5 and waters were built and 
manually inspected in QUANTA.  Atomic coordinates for all structures have been 

 

28

deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), accessible at http://www.rcsb.org/.  Final 
refinement statistics are summarized in the table below:
