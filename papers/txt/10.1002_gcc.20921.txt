Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are a characteristic feature of neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) patients.
NF1 individuals have an 8–13% lifetime risk of developing a malignant PNST (MPNST). Atypical neuroﬁbromas are sympto-
matic, hypercellular PNSTs, composed of cells with hyperchromatic nuclei in the absence of mitoses. Little is known about
the origin and nature of atypical neuroﬁbromas in NF1 patients. In this study, we classiﬁed the atypical neuroﬁbromas in
the spectrum of NF1-associated PNSTs by analyzing 65 tumor samples from 48 NF1 patients. We compared tumor-speciﬁc
chromosomal copy number alterations between benign neuroﬁbromas, atypical neuroﬁbromas, and MPNSTs (low-,
intermediate-, and high-grade) by karyotyping and microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). In 15 be-
nign neuroﬁbromas (4 subcutaneous and 11 plexiform), no copy number alterations were found, except a single event in a
plexiform neuroﬁbroma. One highly signiﬁcant recurrent aberration (15/16) was identiﬁed in the atypical neuroﬁbromas,
namely a deletion with a minimal overlapping region (MOR) in chromosome band 9p21.3, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B.
Copy number loss of the CDKN2A/B gene locus was one of the most common events in the group of MPNSTs, with
deletions in low-,
intermediate-, and high-grade MPNSTs. In one tumor, we observed a clear transition from a benign-
atypical neuroﬁbroma toward an intermediate-grade MPNST, conﬁrmed by both histopathology and aCGH analysis. These
data support the hypothesis that atypical neuroﬁbromas are premalignant tumors, with the CDKN2A/B deletion as the ﬁrst
step in the progression toward MPNST.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is a common,
autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozy-
gous inactivating mutations in the NF1 tumor
suppressor gene (chromosome band 17q11.2)
(Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al., 1990; Wal-
lace et al., 1990). This gene encodes neuroﬁbro-
min, a negative regulator of the ‘‘rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homologue’’
(Martin et al.,
1990). The main clinical characteristics are cafe´ -
au-lait maculae, skin fold freckling, Lisch nod-
ules, and neuroﬁbromas. Other features include
optic pathway gliomas, speciﬁc osseous lesions,
and learning disabilities.

(RAS)

Neuroﬁbromas are benign tumors of the periph-
eral nerve sheath. Different types can be recog-
nized: cutaneous, subcutaneous (s.c.), and plexiform

neuroﬁbromas. Each NF1 patient has an estimated
8–13% cumulative risk of developing a malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) (Evans
et al., 2002). This risk is even two or three times
higher in patients with an NF1 microdeletion com-
pared with patients with an intragenic NF1 muta-
tion (De Raedt et al., 2003). MPNSTs are often
difﬁcult to diagnose in the early phase; they meta-
stasize widely and are associated with a poor

prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is <25% (Evans
et al., 2002).

Neuroﬁbroma-derived Schwann cells, harboring
both a germline and somatic mutation in the NF1
gene, are believed to be the primary neoplastic
cells in neuroﬁbromas (Serra et al., 2000). Bial-
lelic NF1 inactivation also occurs in MPNSTs
(Legius et al., 1993), but it is not sufﬁcient for
MPNST formation. Additional alterations in tu-
mor suppressor genes TP53 and CDKN2A have
been identiﬁed in MPNSTs. The ‘‘tumor protein
(TP53) gene (chromosome band 17p13.1)
53’’
encodes p53 and is involved in cell cycle control,
apoptosis, and DNA damage response. TP53 de-
letion/mutation is one of
the most common
abnormalities found in MPNSTs (Menon et al.,
1990; Legius et al., 1994; Birindelli et al., 2001).
The ‘‘cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A’’
(CDKN2A) gene (chromosome band 9p21.3) enco-
des both p16INK4A, a negative regulator of the
cell cycle, and p14ARF, a protein that promotes
stabilization of p53 through binding with ‘‘mouse
double minute 2 homologue’’ (MDM2). Homozy-
gous CDKN2A deletions are found in 50% of
MPNSTs (Kourea et al., 1999; Nielsen et al.,
1999). None of the abnormalities described ear-
lier are present in neuroﬁbromas.

conﬁrmed,

We performed karyotyping and high-resolution
Agilent 244K microarray-based comparative ge-
nome hybridization (aCGH) on 16 histopathologi-
cally
atypical neuroﬁbromas. To
situate the atypical neuroﬁbroma in the malignant
transformation process, 15 benign neuroﬁbromas
and 34 MPNSTs were also analyzed using the
same methods. Because of their potential role in
MPNST development, TP53 and CDKN2A were
sequenced for mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor Material

The tumor samples were collected from the
University Hospitals of Leuven, Eppendorf (Ham-
burg), AZ Sint-Jan (Bruges), and the Harvard Med-
ical School (Boston). Part of the tumor was snap
frozen and used for DNA isolation with phenol/
chloroform. The other part was dissociated and
used for cell culture as described earlier (Serra
et al., 2000). We established primary cell cultures
from six high-grade MPNSTs (HM1–3, HM9, and
HM22–23). Tumor cells from HM1–2, HM9, and
speciﬁc NF1 / 
HM22 were cultured under
Schwann cell conditions. Cells from HM3 and
HM23 were cultured in a general tumor medium,
as they did not grow in Schwann cell medium.
The presence of MPNST tumor cells was con-
ﬁrmed by karyotyping at the end of the culture.

The tumor samples were removed from 48
patients, fulﬁlling two or more NF1 diagnostic
criteria, established at the NIH Consensus De-
velopment Conference in 1987. Ten patients car-
ried an NF1 microdeletion, of which nine
patients were type I (De Raedt et al., 2004) and
one patient was type II (Kehrer-Sawatzki et al.,
2004). Patient blood DNA was available from 24
of 48 patients. If not available, blood DNA from
a healthy male or female individual was used as a
gender-matched control in aCGH experiments.

The current research protocol was approved by
the University

the local ethical committee of
Hospitals Leuven (S52563).

Histopathology

Depending on their histopathological features
(Scheithauer et al., 1999), the 65 tumor samples

NF1 ATYPICAL NEUROFIBROMAS ARE PREMALIGNANT

1023

were subdivided in six distinct categories: s.c. (4),
plexiform (11), atypical neuroﬁbromas (16), low-
(2), intermediate- (2), and high-grade MPNSTs
(30). The histological grading of MPNSTs was
based on the ‘‘Fe´ de´ ration Nationale des Centres
de Lutte Contre le Cancer’’ grading system
(Guillou et al., 1997).

Cytogenetic Analysis

Schwann cell

Conventional cytogenetic analysis was per-
formed on G-banded metaphases, obtained after
short-term NF1 / 
culture,
a
according to standard procedures (Polito et al.,
2003). If there were sufﬁcient mitoses, at least 15
metaphases were analyzed. Karyotypes were
described using the ‘‘International System for
Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature’’ (ISCN 2009)
criteria.

Mutation Analysis

TP53 and CDKN2A mutation analysis was per-
formed on tumor and patient blood DNA,
if
available. Exons 2–9 of TP53 and all CDKN2A
exons were PCR ampliﬁed and bidirectionally
sequenced on the ABI 3100 using the ABI Big-
Dye Terminator 3.1 Sequencing kit (Applied Bio-
systems, Carlsbad, CA).

aCGH

Agilent 244K aCGH

All samples were analyzed using the 244K
high-resolution oligonucleotide microarray from
Agilent Technologies (Diegem, Belgium). Diges-
tion,
labeling, and hybridization of tumor and
patient or gender-matched blood DNA were per-
formed according to the protocol of the manufac-
turer (‘‘Agilent Oligonucleotide Array-based CGH
for Genomic DNA Analysis,’’ Enzymatic Label-
ing for Blood, Cells, or Tissues
(with High
Throughput option) v6.2.1, February 2010).

The level of copy number losses and gains was
checked visually in the individual proﬁles. Chro-
mosomal regions with a minimum average log2ra-
tio of 0.15 were considered as gains and of  0.15
as losses. A loss was called homozygous when the
log2ratio was lower than  1, and a gain was called
an ampliﬁcation when the log2ratio was higher
than 0.58. When gender-matched control DNA
was used from an unrelated individual (patient
blood DNA was not available), somatic copy
number variations were excluded if they occurred

in known copy number variable regions indicated
by the Genomic Workbench Software.

Statistical Analysis of Recurrent DNA Copy
Number Gains and Losses

The Agilent 244K aCGH data were used as
obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction
software. The datasets of 16 atypical neuroﬁbro-
mas and 23 independent primary high-grade
MPNSTs were both analyzed with the KCsmart
software for statistically signiﬁcant recurrent copy
number gains and losses (Klijn et al., 2008). The
datasets of the benign neuroﬁbromas, low-, and
intermediate-grade MPNSTs were not analyzed
for recurrent chromosomal aberrations because of
the small number of alterations or samples in the
dataset.

We removed all clones where at least one log2-
ratio was missing. A KCsmart 1000 permutation
analysis was performed to create a null distribu-
tion. Peaks were detected at P < 0.05 (Bonferroni
corrected for multiple testing), for different ker-
nel widths between 5 Mb and 100 kb.

RESULTS

Clinical Data

The patients’ gender, presence/type of NF1
microdeletion, age at surgery (years), and infor-
mation on the tumors (type, location, and mate-
rial) are summarized in Table 1. We evaluated 65
tumor samples (59 snap frozen and six cell lines)
originating from 62 different PNSTs. At the time
of surgery, the patients’ age ranged from 9 to 63
years. From the 58 tumors with known location,
26 were localized in the trunk, 25 in the extremi-
ties, and 7 in the head–neck region.

Cytogenetic Analysis

An overview of all karyotypes can be found in
Supporting Information Table 1. Karyotypes were
available for 10/15 benign neuroﬁbromas (two s.c.
and eight plexiform). No clonal cytogenetic aber-
rations were observed in the majority of tumors.
In one plexiform neuroﬁbroma (PN10), almost all
cells showed a deletion at chromosome band
7p15, which was later conﬁrmed by Agilent 244K
aCGH analysis. We observed one cell in a tetra-
ploid state in PN10.

In 11 out of 14 karyotyped atypical neuroﬁbro-
mas, chromosome 9 was involved in the chromo-
somal
rearrangements in 13–100% of analyzed

cells. Besides chromosome 9, aberrations on other
chromosomes were also frequently observed.
Nine atypical neuroﬁbromas showed a triploid or
tetraploid state in 10–67% of analyzed cells.

According to their karyotypes, the two low-grade
MPNSTs differed from each other. LM1 had multi-
ple alterations affecting chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, 10,
13, and 21. One of the analyzed cells of LM1
showed a tetraploid state. In LM2, there were dele-
tions on the short arm of chromosome 9 in 16 and
an isochromosome 7 in 2 out of 18 analyzed cells.

One intermediate and 11 investigated high-
grade MPNSTs showed multiple complex chro-
mosomal aberrations
in 20–100% of analyzed
cells. Polyploidy (3n) was observed in the inter-
mediate-grade MPNST and in 5 out of 11 high-
grade MPNSTs.

CDKN2A and TP53 Mutation Analysis

CDKN2A and TP53 were sequenced for muta-
tions in tumor and patient blood DNA, if avail-
able. No mutations were found in 15 benign and
16 atypical neuroﬁbromas. The CDKN2A muta-
tion c.203dupC, detected in LM1, was located in
exon 2 (codon 68), resulting in a frameshift and a
premature stop codon (p.A68AfsX119). The rela-
tive height of the mutation peak is 40% of the
normal peak, suggesting a heterozygous mutation
in 80% of the cells. In three out of six high-grade
MPNST cell lines (HM2, HM3 and HM23), a
heterozygous TP53 point mutation was present in
all cells. Mutation c.329G>C (p.R110P) (HM2)
and c.535C>T (p.H179Y) (HM23) were situated
in the DNA binding domain, a highly conserved
region in the TP53 gene. Mutation c.96 þ 1G>A
was identiﬁed as a splice site mutation in HM3.
There was no frozen tumor tissue left to conﬁrm
the mutation found in the MPNST cell lines.

plexiform neuroﬁbroma
(PN10), we identiﬁed two deletions (log2ratio ¼
 0.5) on the short arm of chromosome 7, namely
a 1.83Mb (p21.1-p15.3) and a 31.97Mb (p15.3-
p11.2) deletion. None of these regions were part
of the recurrent copy number losses in atypical
neuroﬁbromas or MPNSTs.

Atypical neuroﬁbromas

In 15 of 16 atypical neuroﬁbromas, we detected
deletions on the short arm of chromosome 9,
resulting in several minimal overlapping regions
(MORs) (Table 2), with 9p21.3 being the most
commonly deleted region (Fig. 1). The length of
this deletion varied from 0.22 to 39.60 Mb, with a
minimum overlap of 0.16 Mb localized at 21.95–
22.11 Mb (Human Genome Build NCBI36),
including CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Because of tu-
mor heterogeneity, only in one atypical neuroﬁ-
broma (A2), the 9p loss could be considered as a

homozygous deletion (log2ratio ¼  2.5) in almost

all cells. For ﬁve samples (A7, A9, A11, A14, and
A16), the log2ratio of the 9p21.3 deletion was
more negative than the other deletions on 9p,
suggesting a homozygous deletion at 9p21.3.
Apart from the 9p21.3 deletion, there were seven
additional MORs at 9p, including the SMARCA2,
RFX3, GLIS3, PTPRD, and LRRN6C genes (Ta-
ble 2). Additional copy number changes were
observed in 13 atypical neuroﬁbromas, but these
alterations were far less frequent and occurred in
a lower percentage of cells, compared with the
9p21.3 deletion (Supporting Information Table 2).

in LM2. A complex
LM1, and homozygous

different from each other, was detected in the in-
termediate MPNSTs. IM1 had many copy num-
ber changes, more gains than losses, in almost all
cells, but no deletion on the short arm of chromo-
some 9. In IM2, the number of alterations was
smaller than in IM1 and occurred in a lower per-
centage of cells (20–30%). This might reﬂect the
admixture with normal and atypical cells, since
sample IM2 and A7 were obtained from the same
tumor, as the inner and outer part, respectively
(Fig. 2A). By sampling, we were not able to
clearly separate the neuroﬁbroma from the atypi-
cal neuroﬁbroma part, but based on histopathol-
ogy we could. The alterations found in IM2 were
those present in A7 but with additional losses on
chromosome 1p, 10, 11, and 21 (Fig. 2B). One of
the observed tumor speciﬁc copy number losses
was a type II NF1 microdeletion in A7 and IM2,
presenting the somatic NF1 mutation in this tu-
mor (Fig. 2C).

An overview of all alterations in low- and inter-
mediate-grade MPNSTs is shown in Supporting
Information Table 2.

In the high-grade MPNST group, 23 inde-
pendent primary tumors were analyzed. Seven
other samples came from metastases of primary
tumors (HM11 and HM29), recurrences after sur-
gery (HM16, HM18, HM21, and HM27), or

of the statistically signiﬁcant recurrent copy num-
ber altered regions (visualized in Fig. 3, using the
KCsmart analysis tool), MORs, (candidate) cancer
genes, and microRNAs,
in the 23 independent
primary high-grade MPNSTs. Sixteen of 23 high-
grade MPNSTs (70%) showed copy number loss
of the CDKN2A/B gene locus, of which 12 were
considered homozygous. Loss of TP53 was
observed in 12 high-grade MPNSTs. In addition
to CDKN2A and TP53, other genes were fre-
quently involved in recurrent chromosomal rear-
rangements (Fig. 3 and Supporting Information
Table 3). Gain of the PDGFRA/KIT (4q12), the
TWIST1 (7p21.1), the EGFR (7p11.2), the MET
(7q31.2), and the MYC region (8q24.21) was
observed in 13, 18, 17, 15, and 16/23 high-grade
MPNSTs, respectively. Of note is the copy num-
ber gain of CCND2 (12p13.32)
and MDM2
(12q15) in 11 and 9 high-grade MPNSTs, respec-
tively. Additionally,
large segments of chromo-

respectively. In 14 high-grade
MPNSTs, the PTEN gene (10q23.31) was deleted.
(Partial) loss of chromosome arms 11p and 11q was
observed in 19 and 20 high-grade MPNSTs,
respectively. The CDKN1C gene (11p15.4) was lost
in 14 high-grade tumors. The region with the high-
est deletion frequency (18/23) on chromosome 11
(11q22.3-q23.1) included the genes ATM, DDX10,
and cancer-related microRNAs hsa-mir-34b and c.
The RB1 (13q14.2), SPRY2 (13q31.1), and SUZ12
gene (17q11.2) was deleted in 12, 14, and 17 high-
grade MPNSTs, respectively. The long arm of
chromosome 22 or parts of it were frequently lost,
including several tumor suppressor genes such as
CHEK2 (22q12.1) and NF2 (22q12.2), which were
deleted in 13 high-grade MPNSTs.

When analyzing the metastases (HM11 and
(HM9, HM16, HM18,
HM29) or
HM21, and HM27), no or minor recurrent copy
number alterations other
than those already
observed in the group of the independent pri-
mary tumors were identiﬁed.

DISCUSSION

This is the ﬁrst report where large numbers of
histopathologically conﬁrmed benign and atypical
neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs (low-, intermediate-,
and high-grade) are evaluated by conventional cy-
togenetics, high-resolution Agilent 244K aCGH
and CDKN2A/TP53 mutation analysis.

Biallelic inactivation of NF1 and subsequent
loss of neuroﬁbromin in Schwann cells leads to

prolonged activation of RAS and increased cell
proliferation. Although this is sufﬁcient for neuro-
ﬁbroma formation, further genetic events are nec-
essary

malignancy.

In 15 of the 16 atypical neuroﬁbromas, a dele-
tion at 9p21.3 was observed. In six cases, this
9p21.3 deletion was interpreted as homozygous as
a lower log2ratio was found in this region com-
pared with the nearby deleted loci on chromo-
some arm 9p. Two genes are located in the
MOR, namely CDKN2A and CDKN2B. The
CDKN2A locus encodes p16INK4A and p14ARF,
which are negative regulators of the cell cycle
through interaction with RB1 and p53. The
‘‘cyclin-dependent
2B’’
(CDKN2B) gene encodes p15INK4B, which con-
trols the cell cycle G1 progression by interacting
with CDK4 and CDK6. This gene is located ad-
jacent to the CDKN2A gene locus and is often
codeleted with CDKN2A in MPNSTs (Perrone
et al., 2003; Mantripragada et al., 2009). Deletion
of CDKN2A/B was identiﬁed in 70% of independ-
ent primary high-grade MPNSTs. Previous
reports on the involvement of CDKN2A in NF1-
related MPNSTs have revealed alterations in 40–
60% of cases. In contrast with MPNSTs, studies
on neuroﬁbromas did not reveal CDKN2A abnor-
malities (Kourea et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 1999;
Mantripragada et al., 2008, 2009).

vitro as it induces cell cycle arrest by cooperating
with RB1 in repressing E2F1 (Trouche et al.,
1997). The ‘‘protein tyrosine phosphatase recep-
tor type D’’ (PTPRD) gene, also lost in six atypi-
cal neuroﬁbromas and 11 high-grade MPNSTs,
encodes a transmembrane protein with a cytoplas-
mic tyrosine phosphatase domain. PTPRD is a
candidate tumor suppressor gene as it is inacti-
vated in glioblastoma and other human cancers
(Veeriah et al., 2009).

Mutations in CDKN2A and TP53 were only
detected in MPNSTs and not in benign or atypi-
neuroﬁbromas. The CDKN2A mutation

NF1-related MPNSTs (Kourea et al., 1999; Niel-
sen et al., 1999). In contrast to CDKN2A, previous
studies did report
in
MPNSTs from NF1 patients. The percentage of
MPNSTs harboring these mutations strongly dif-
fers among the various studies, which might be
explained by the small sets of analyzed tumors
(Verdijk et al., 2010). In our study, we observed
three pathogenic TP53 mutations in three high-
grade MPNST cell lines, which were also listed
in the ‘‘International Agency of Research on Can-
cer’’ TP53 database. The fact that we did not
ﬁnd TP53 mutations in tissue samples could be
due to the heterogeneous nature of the tumors.
In our tumor panel, TP53 mutations were only
detected in high-grade MPNSTs and not in low-
or intermediate-grade. This can be explained by
the fact that the number of samples analyzed was
too low or by the hypothesis that mutations of

the fact that the same second hit was seen in
both A7 and IM2, namely an identical type II
NF1 microdeletion (Fig. 2C). This is the ﬁrst
report describing the same somatic NF1 mutation
in samples with a different histology coming from
the same tumor. The transition of a plexiform
neuroﬁbroma toward an MPNST through atypical
neuroﬁbroma was reported previously (Spurlock
et al., 2010). Unfortunately, they were unable to
prove that the different investigated tumor sam-
ples were part of the same tumoral lesion. The
different samples were derived from separate
nodules on the same peripheral nerve affected by
NF1. This is in contrast to our data, where we
clearly show that in one tumor we have a distinct
transition from an outer part consisting of benign
neuroﬁbroma, a middle part of atypical neuroﬁ-
broma,
intermediate-grade
MPNST tissue, which is conﬁrmed by both histo-
pathological and molecular data.

and a nucleus of

TP53 occur later on in tumor development. This
is further conﬁrmed by the fact that also TP53
deletions are only seen in intermediate- and
high-grade MPNSTs.

Clinically and genetically, we were not able to
distinguish atypical neuroﬁbromas from low-grade
MPNSTs, but we only had two low-grade
MPNSTs to compare with 16 atypical neuroﬁbro-
mas. Often both tumor types grow, cause pain
and discomfort, with an increased glucose uptake
on 18F-FDG-PET scan. By aCGH and mutation
analysis, we identiﬁed inactivation of CDKN2A as
the recurrent lesion with the highest signiﬁcance
in both groups. On histology, an atypical neuroﬁ-
broma is not the same as a low-grade MPNST.
An atypical neuroﬁbroma is characterized by a
more variable cellularity than a benign neuroﬁ-
broma and by cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic
nuclei. MPNSTs were deﬁned based on the
WHO criteria and graded according to the French
grading system, as stated in the ‘‘Materials and
Methods’’ section. A low-grade MPNST is a uni-
formly hypercellular and fascicular
lesion with
generalized nuclear atypia. We histologically clas-
siﬁed atypical neuroﬁbromas
and low-grade
MPNSTs, but it is clear that there is still discus-
sion about the use and deﬁnition of the terms
atypical neuroﬁbroma and low-grade MPNST
(Weiss and Goldblum, 2008). This is not surpris-
ing, since it concerns lesions in the gray zone
between benign and malignant, and the process
of transformation is gradual.

transformation

The hypothesis that a benign neuroﬁbroma
undergoes malignant
toward
MPNST through the stage of atypical neuroﬁ-
broma is further conﬁrmed by the fact that in
some tumors, multiple regions with different his-
topathological features were seen. For example,
in the tumor resected from patient 23, there was
a transition from a benign outer part into an atyp-
ical deeper layer and further into the center con-
sisting of intermediate-grade MPNST tissue (Fig.
2A). We were able to separate the outer layers
(benign-atypical neuroﬁbroma) from the internal
MPNST tissue. We analyzed these samples by
Agilent 244K aCGH analysis. The outer part (A7)
showed a 9p21.3 deletion in a high percentage of
cells and some other genetic imbalances in a
lower amount of cells, consistent with an atypical
neuroﬁbroma. The inner nucleus (IM2) showed
the same alterations as seen in A7, but in a larger
proportion of cells, and a number of additional
aberrations, as is typically seen in MPNSTs (Fig.
2B). The hypothesis was further conﬁrmed by

such

In this report, several cell signaling pathways
were found to play a role in the subsequent trans-
formation and progression of MPNSTs. Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase and Growth Factor Receptor
pathways, namely the MAPK and PI3K pathways,
are altered through ampliﬁcation of PDGFRA,
KIT, EGFR, and MET and deletion of SPRY1,
SPRY2, and PTEN. Important cell cycle regula-
as TP53, MDM2, CDKN2A/B/C,
tors
CDKN1C, and RB1 are also part of the recurrent
copy number changes. Modiﬁcations in DNA
repair gene ATM, apoptosis inhibitors (BIRC5 and
TWIST1), and neural crest transcription factors
(TWIST1 and SOX9) are part of
the genetic
events occurring during MPNST progression.
Moreover, this study is the ﬁrst report that links
the development of MPNSTs to alterations in
the chromatin remodeling genes SUZ12, part of
the Polycomb Repressive Complex
and
SMARCA2/D1, part of
the SWI/SNF complex.
This study highlights several signiﬁcant recurrent
copy number gains (12, 14q, 20q, and 21q) and
losses (3q, 4q, 8p, 10, 13q, and 16q) that were not
yet
to NF1-related
MPNSTs. For most of these alterations, we pro-
posed a number of genes potentially involved in
the malignant transformation process. We cannot
rule out that there are other rare copy number
aberrations relevant for MPNST formation that
were not statistically signiﬁcant in our series.

We conclude that loss of the important cell cycle
regulator, CDKN2A, is the hallmark of atypical neu-
roﬁbromas. We showed that atypical neuroﬁbromas
should be considered as premalignant tumors.
