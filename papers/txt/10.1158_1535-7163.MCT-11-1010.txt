Abstract

The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is activated in more than 30% of human cancers, most commonly via
mutation in the K-ras oncogene and also via mutations in BRAF. Several allosteric mitogen-activated protein/
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, aimed at treating tumors with RAS/RAF pathway
alterations, are in clinical development. However, acquired resistance to these inhibitors has been documented
both in preclinical and clinical samples. To identify strategies to overcome this resistance, we have derived
three independent MEK inhibitor–resistant cell lines. Resistance to allosteric MEK inhibitors in these cell lines
was consistently linked to acquired mutations in the allosteric binding pocket of MEK. In one cell line,
concurrent ampliﬁcation of mutant K-ras was observed in conjunction with MEK allosteric pocket mutations.
Clonal analysis showed that both resistance mechanisms occur in the same cell and contribute to enhanced
resistance. Importantly, in all cases the MEK-resistant cell lines retained their addiction to the mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as evidenced by their sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of the
ERK1/2 kinases. These data suggest that tumors with acquired MEK inhibitor resistance remain dependent on
the MAPK pathway and are therefore sensitive to inhibitors that act downstream of the mutated MEK target.
Importantly, we show that dual inhibition of MEK and ERK by small molecule inhibitors was synergistic and
acted to both inhibit the emergence of resistance, as well as to overcome acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors.
Therefore, our data provide a rationale for cotargeting multiple nodes within the MAPK signaling cascade in
K-ras mutant tumors to maximize therapeutic beneﬁt for patients. Mol Cancer Ther; 11(5); 1143–54. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is widely activated in
human cancers and thus has attracted signiﬁcant interest
as a therapeutic target for cancer (1). Efforts to target RAS
directly have not been successful to date, but recent
clinical trials with BRAF and mitogen-activated pro-
tein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) inhibi-
tors have suggested that targeting these downstream RAS
effectors holds promise in the treatment of cancers har-
boring oncogenic alterations in the pathway (2). Although
clinical responses and antitumor activity can be impres-
sive, particularly for BRAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant

melanoma, the majority of patients ultimately develop
clinical resistance and progressive disease on these agents
(2, 3). Preclinical studies have identiﬁed multiple mechan-
isms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors, including
switching between RAF isoforms (4), upregulation of RTK
or NRAS signaling (5), and reactivation of mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling via COT activa-
tion (6) or a MEK kinase activating mutation (7). Similarly,
preclinical studies have identiﬁed distinct mechanisms by
which cells acquire resistance to MEK inhibition, includ-
ing ampliﬁcation of mutant BRAF (8), STAT3 upregula-
tion (9), or mutations in the allosteric pocket of MEK that
can directly block binding of inhibitors to the MEK kinase
or lead to constitutive MEK kinase activity (10, 11). MEK
mutations have also been described in tumor samples
from patients treated with MEK (11) or BRAF inhibitors
(7), showing clinical relevance.

In comparison with RAF and MEK inhibitors, the
development of
small molecule inhibitors against
ERK1/2, the kinases that act directly downstream of MEK,
has lagged behind. Nevertheless, examples of selective
ERK1/2 inhibitors have been reported and are currently
in preclinical development (12, 13). In this study, we set
out to characterize the mechanisms of acquired resistance
to MEK allosteric inhibitors in cancer cell lines harboring

oncogenic K-ras mutations and identify strategies to over-
come this resistance, with a focus on cotargeting ERK and
MEK. Our goal was to determine whether K-ras mutant,
MEK-resistant cells maintained addiction to the MAPK
pathway and sensitivity to inhibition of the pathway at the
level of ERK1/2.

Our major ﬁnding is that MEK inhibitor–resistant
cells consistently maintain their addiction to the MAPK
pathway and their sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of
ERK1/2. Combination treatment of naive K-ras mutant
cells with MEK plus ERK inhibitors inhibited the out-
growth of resistant cells, whereas ERK inhibitor treatment
of cells with acquired MEK inhibitor resistance cells effec-
tively blocked their proliferation. These ﬁndings support
the rationale for the clinical development of small molecule
ERK1/2 inhibitors in conjunction with MEK inhibitors as a
therapeutic strategy for patients with MAPK pathway–
addicted (K-ras mutant and BRAF mutant) tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines

MDA-MB-231, LoVo, HCT-116, H2122, and BL2122
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Col-
lection (ATCC) and archived in the Genentech cell bank.
COLO206F and COLO206F-AR cells were kindly pro-
vided by Ryan Corcoran and Jeffrey Engelman (Massa-
chusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA). Starting
parental cell lines for MDA-MB-231, LoVo, and HCT-116
were authenticated at Genetica, Inc., (www.genetica.com)
using a Multiplex STR assay, whereas H2122 and BL2122
cells were assayed at early passage after acquisition from
ATCC. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
or Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium supplemented
with 10% FBS (Sigma), nonessential amino acids, and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine.

Compounds and cell viability experiments

All studies in this article describing MEK and ERK
inhibition have used the potent and selective MEK1/2
inhibitors PD0325901 (Pﬁzer; ref. 14) and G-573 (Genentech;
ref. 15), as well as the ERK inhibitor (12, 13), to evaluate
the effects of MEK and ERK inhibition. Selectivity of the
ERK inhibitor for ERK1/2 across a panel of kinases, and for
KRAS mutant versus matched normal cells, is provided in
Supplementary Fig. S1. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitors and BRAF inhibitors used in this study
were provided by the Genentech Medicinal Chemistry
department and have been described previously (16–18).
The structures of the ERK, MEK, PI3K, and BRAF inhibitors
used are provided. All other compounds were purchas-
ed commercially. Cell viability and bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) studies were conducted as described previously
(19, 20). All in vitro cell viability experiments were repeated
independently at least 3 times with similar results.

Resistant cell line selection

The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and colon
cancer cell lines LoVo and HCT-116 were grown in

of

concentrations

increasing
the MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 (Pﬁzer), until they grew normally in a con-
centration of 10 mmol/L for MDA-MB-231 and 5 mmol/L
for LoVo and HCT-116. Resistant clones of HCT-116 MEK-
R were isolated by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
individual cells into 96-well plates.

Western blot analyses and transfections
For MEK and ERK inhibitor dose response blots, cells
were plated at a density of 9 105 cells per well into 4-well
plates and dosed the following day with 2-fold or 3-fold
serial dilutions of ERKi, MEKi-1, MEKi-2, starting at
10 mmol/L for 24 hours. Details of antibodies and condi-
tions are provided in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Combination experiments. Combination data were
analyzed in R version 2.12.1 (21) and results summarized
graphically across the combinations tested. To assess
inhibition under various drug combinations in excess of
that predicted by Bliss additivity, smoothed estimates of
the 2 drugs’ single-agent curves were used to derive a
predicted inhibition response surface, as in Borisy and
colleagues (22). More details are provided in Supplemen-
tary Methods.

Three-dimensional cultures

For 3-dimensional (3-D) cultures, MDA-MB-231 paren-
tal and MEK-R cells were trypsinized from monolayer
cultures and plated on top of commercially available
laminin-rich matrix produced from Engelbreth-Holm-
Swarm tumors (Matrigel; BD Biosciences) using a previ-
ously described protocol (20).

Sequencing parental and resistant cell lines

Exonic regions of MEK1, MEK2, and KRAS were ampli-
ﬁed by nested PCR of genomic DNA and sequenced in
both directions using Big Dye Terminator Kit reagents
and an ABI PRISM 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied
Biosystems).

Gene expression microarray and copy number
analyses

Gene expression analysis of breast cancer cell lines
MDA-MB-231 parental and MEK-R lines was as described
previously (20). Pathway relationships for genes differen-
tially expressed between MDA-MB-231 parental and MEK-
R cells was determined using Ingenuity software. Copy
number analyses were carried out after correcting for GC-
content bias following Diskin and colleagues (23) and then
segmented using CBS (24). These analyses are described in
more detail in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

ERK Inhibitors Overcome MEK Resistance

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with well-
deﬁned molecular subtypes referred to as luminal, HER2
positive, and basal-like (26). Previous work has suggested
that basal-like breast cancer models are dependent on
RAS/RAF/MEK signaling and show a high degree of
sensitivity to MEK inhibition relative to models represent-
ing the other subtypes (20, 27). We exposed K-ras mutant
MDA-MB-231 basal-like breast cancer cells to increasing

concentrations of the selective allosteric MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 (ref. 28; referred to as MEKi-1) over a period of
several months and gradually selected a pool of cells that
could grow normally in the presence of 10 mmol/L MEKi-
1. Analysis of cellular inhibition using an ATP-based cell
viability assay showed a shift in IC50 for MEKi-1 from
0.3 mmol/L in the parental line to greater than 10 mmol/L
top). The

(MEK-R) cells (Fig. 1A,

Figure 1. K-ras mutant MDA-MB-231 MEK-resistant (MEK-R) cells are insensitive to 2 independent MEK inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ERK inhibition for
both cell viability and pharmacodynamic responses. A, top, MDA-MB-231 parental and MEK-resistant (MEK-R) cells were treated with a range of
concentrations of MEKi-1 (PD0325901) or MEKi-2 (G-573) for 72 hours and cell viability was measured by ATP-based viability assays. Cells were plated in
quadruplicate for each condition, and cell viability experiments were repeated independently at least 3 times with similar results. Bottom, parental and
MEK-R cells were treated with MEKi-1for 72 hours and BrdUrd incorporation over a 5-hour labeling period was quantitated by high content imaging.
Asterisks indicate that IC50 values are signiﬁcantly different based on nonoverlapping 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) from nonlinear regression analysis.
B, MDA-MB-231 parental and MEK-R cells were grown in 3-D culture in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L MEKi-1 or ERKi and representatives from
triplicate wells were photographed to assess cell morphology and response to MEK inhibition. C, effects of MEKi versus ERKi on cell viability measured by

mechanism of action of MEK inhibition in MDA-MB-231
cells has been previously shown to involve reduced pro-
liferation rather than apoptosis (20), so we next examined
effects of MEKi-1 on BrdUrd incorporation in parental
and MEK-R cells. We observed that although MEK-R cells
showed a slightly lower proliferation rate at baseline (57%
vs. 71% BrdUrd incorporation over 5 hours), they showed
only minimal reduction of BrdUrd incorporation in the
presence of increasing MEKi-1 concentration compared
with parental cells (Fig. 1A, bottom). To conﬁrm that this
resistance was not unique to MEKi-1, we veriﬁed that
MEK-R cells are similarly resistant to a second allosteric
MEK inhibitor (G-573, referred to as MEKi-2; ref. 15) in a
cell viability assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition,
resistance was stable when cells were cultured for 3
months in the absence of drug and then reassayed for
sensitivity to MEK inhibition, suggesting a stable genetic
change (Supplementary Fig. S2). Differential effects
between parental and MEK-R cells seemed speciﬁc to
MEK inhibition, as both lines responded similarly when
screened with a panel of other targeted and chemother-
apeutic agents, including PI3 kinase inhibitors (18, 29), the
HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and chemotherapeutics
such as paclitaxel and etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To assay resistance in a setting that may be more
reﬂective of in vivo biology, we cultured both parental
and MEK-R cells in a 3-D matrix of collagen and laminin
(Matrigel) and assayed for sensitivity to MEK inhibition as
well as for changes in morphology in the resistant cells
(Fig. 1B). We found that growth of parental cells in 3-D
culture was completely inhibited at a concentration of 1
mmol/L MEK inhibitor, whereas MEK-R cells were still
able to grow and form colonies at this concentration. In
addition, we found that MEK-R cells plated and grown in
3-D culture adopted a much more rounded morphology
compared with the stellate morphology exhibited by
parental cells. This rounded morphology is typically
associated with a more luminal epithelial phenotype in
cell lines, whereas the stellate morphology is associated
with more invasive basal-like mesenchymal lines (30).
Furthermore, microarray gene expression proﬁling of
RNA from parental cells cultured in standard media and
MEK-R cells cultured in 10 mmol/L MEKi-1 showed
upregulation of genes involved in luminal epithelial cell
fates and concomitant downregulation of mesenchymal
cell fate regulators in MEK-R cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3). These ﬁndings are consistent with recent studies
showing that MAPK signaling can regulate the mesen-
chymal fate in basal-like breast cancer cells (31) and
suggest that selection of MDA-MB-231 cells in the pres-
ence of a MEK inhibitor seems to have downregulated this
pathway and resulted in mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition.

MEK-R KRAS mutant cells retain sensitivity to ERK
inhibition

Because MEK-R cells maintain ERK and RSK activation
in the presence of MEK inhibitor, we next tested whether

they are still dependent on signaling through the RAS/
MEK/ERK axis for survival and proliferation by treating
with a selective and potent inhibitor of ERK1/2 (ERKi
refs. 12, 13). Selectivity testing for activity of this inhibitor
against a panel of 200 other kinases failed to identify any
target other than ERK that was substantially inhibited
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), and this compound was sub-
stantially more potent in KRAS mutant H2122 cells than in
normal, immortalized BL2122 cells derived from the same
patient (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We found that parental
and MEK-R cells showed similar sensitivity to this selec-
tive ERK inhibitor in cell viability assays conducted in
both 3-D culture and standard 2-D format, suggesting that
ERK inhibition can overcome MEK inhibitor resistance
(Fig. 1B and C, respectively). Furthermore, although MEK
inhibition was unable to suppress levels of the ERK target
sites on phospho- RSKT359Ser363 in MEK-R cells, ERK
inhibitors effectively suppressed pRSKT359Ser363 levels
with similar potency as in parental cells (Fig. 1D). These
ﬁndings strongly suggested that KRAS mutant MEK-R
cells retain overall dependence on RAS/MEK/ERK sig-
naling despite their insensitivity to pathway inhibition at
the level of MEK.

We expanded our analysis to additional tumor cell lines
from other tumor cell lines harboring K-ras mutations.
Because up to 40% of colorectal cancers harbor activating
K-ras mutations (32), we used the colorectal lines HCT-116
and LoVo, both of which show strong in vitro sensitivity to
2 different allosteric MEK inhibitors (Fig. 2A). We were
able to select derivatives of both lines that could grow
normally in the presence of 5 mmol/L MEKi-1 and were
also resistant to MEKi-2 (Fig. 2A). Similar to the MDA-
MB-231 MEK-R cells, both HCT-116 and LoVo MEK-R
cells seemed to retain dependence on RAS/MEK/ERK
signaling as ERK inhibition was able to decrease cell
proliferation and inhibit pRSK to a similar degree as was
observed in parental cells (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, we
examined the effects of ERK and MEK inhibitors on
MAPK substrates more globally by immunoblotting
lysates from treated HCT-116 parental and MEK-R cells
with an antibody recognizing the canonical ERK phos-
phorylation motif PXtP (Fig. 2C). We found that although
in parental cells both ERKi and MEKi could abolish ERK
substrate phosphorylation, in contrast, in MEK-R cells,
basal ERK substrate phosphorylation was higher and was
only abolished by ERKi treatment. Thus, in all MEK-R cell
lines analyzed, MEK resistance and pathway activation
could be effectively overcome by ERK inhibition.

Molecular mechanisms of MEK resistance

The observation that all of the MEK-R lines identiﬁed
in this study retained sensitivity to ERK inhibition sug-
gested that the mechanism of resistance was acting at or
above the level of MEK itself, as ERK is a direct down-
stream substrate of MEK. To identify such mechanisms of
resistance, we ﬁrst sequenced the coding regions of MEK1
and MEK2. Mutational analysis showed that MEK-R cells
derived from MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cells harbor

mutations in MEK1 that are predicted to result in L115P
and F129L substitutions, respectively, whereas those
derived from LoVo cells harbor a mutation in MEK2
predicted to cause a V215E substitution (homologous to
V211D mutations in MEK1; Table 1, Supplementary Fig.
S4). These mutations are all heterozygous and occur
within the allosteric binding pocket in which arylamine
MEK inhibitors are known to bind (Fig. 3A). In addition,
the identiﬁed mutations have all previously been shown
to confer in vitro MEK inhibitor resistance in random
mutagenesis experiments followed by stable transfection
functional assays of MEK inhibitor resistance in BRAF
mutant cells (11). The L115P and V211D mutations confer
resistance by abrogating MEK inhibitor binding, while
F129L also increases intrinsic kinase activity of MEK (10).
All 3 of our cell lines retained the activating K-ras (G13D)
allele. To assess whether the MEK mutations were present
in a preexisting subpopulation or arose de novo in the
presence of MEK inhibitor, we used digital PCR with a
TaqMan genotyping assay for the L115P-causing muta-
tion on DNA from parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Supple-

mentary Fig. S5). We screened approximately 68,850
genome equivalents in this assay and did not detect any
evidence of the L115P alteration. These data suggested
that the L115P mutation is either not present, or is only
present in a very small subpopulation, in the parental cell
line. To show that these mutations can abrogate MEK

used in this study, we introduced the L115P mutation into
MEK1 by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected HCT-
116 parental cells with this construct or a wild-type ver-
sion of MEK1. We found that expression of MEK1 (L115P)
effectively blocked MEK inhibitor–mediated downregu-
lation of pRSK in transfected cells but did not affect ERK
inhibitor–mediated downregulation (Fig. 3B). These data
suggested that although MEK-R cells may be escaping
from tumor growth inhibition due to the failure of MEK

inhibitors to bind and inhibit mutant MEK, they retain the
ability to respond to ERK inhibition.

We next sought to investigate the upregulation of ERK
substrate phosphorylation observed in HCT-116 cells
(Fig. 2C) by assaying for levels of MAPK signaling path-
way components in all 3 MEK-R–resistant lines. Our
Western blot data showed overexpression of K-Ras along
with induction of phosphorylated CRAF and phosphor-
ylated ERK, selectively in the HCT-116 MEK-R cells (Fig.
3C, left panel) and not in the MDA-MB-231 or LoVo MEK-
R cells. HCT-116 MEK-R cells also displayed increased

BRAF and CRAF activity levels as shown by an immu-
noprecipitation/kinase assay (Fig. 3C). These results,
along with the ERK substrate results previously describ-
ed, suggested that the pathway is hyperactivated in
HCT-116 cells, and that additional mechanisms of resis-
tance might be involved in this tumor model.

To identify additional mechanisms of resistance, we
assessed global copy number data from comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays for differences
between parental and resistant cell lines. In the case of
MDA-MB-231 and LoVo cells, this analysis did not
reveal any substantial differences in copy number for
BRAF, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, or K-ras or any other loci. In
contrast, HCT-116 MEK-R cells showed high-level
ampliﬁcation, speciﬁcally at the K-ras locus, but not other
loci, compared with parental cells (Fig. 4A). Quanti-
tation of copy number by quantitative genomic PCR
indicated that the HCT-116 MEK-R cells carry 23 copies

of K-ras (Supplementary Fig. S6A), and sequence ana-
lysis suggested selective ampliﬁcation of the mutant
K-ras allele, because a wild-type allele peak is not detect-
able in the sequencing trace (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
K-ras ampliﬁcation has previously been reported to
underlie acquired MEK resistance in derivatives of
this cell line selected for resistance to the MEK inhibitor
AZD-6244 (33). Because the HCT-116 MEK-R pool
showed evidence of 2 distinct mechanisms of resist-
ance, a MEK1 (F129L) mutation and KRAS ampliﬁcation,
we next asked whether these alterations were occurr-
ing in the same cells or in different cells within the
pool population, perhaps representing distinct clonal
lineages. We cloned individual cells in 96-well plates,
waited until the population expanded, then sequenced
MEK1 and determined KRAS copy number via qPCR
assay. This analysis revealed surprising heterogeneity
(Supplementary Fig. S7, Fig. 4), with the majority of cells

having both the F129L mutation and varying degrees of
KRAS ampliﬁcation. One clone was wild-type for MEK1
with very low levels of KRAS ampliﬁcation, similar to
parental cells. Surprisingly, we also identiﬁed 2 clones
with low levels of KRAS ampliﬁcation that harbored
both F129L as well as a second MEK1 mutation predicted
to cause an I111N substitution. This alteration has also
been previously described to block MEK inhibitor bind-
ing (11). We next screened a representative set of clones for
sensitivity to MEKi-1 and ERKi (Fig. 4B) and found that the
MEK1 F129L/I111N double mutant cells showed the
greatest resistance to MEK inhibitors, whereas clones with
KRAS ampliﬁcation and a concurrent F129L mutation
showed a correlation between greater resistance to MEK
inhibitors and high KRAS copy number above a certain
threshold (approximately 30 copies). This pattern of
mutations and resistance suggests that the F129L MEK1
mutation was selected for early on, and during subse-
quent selection, different subsets of clones acquired
additional genetic events that increased their resistance,
either high-level K-Ras ampliﬁcation or an additional
I111N MEK1 mutation, to more effectively block MEK
inhibitor binding. It is notable that all of the clones
retained strong sensitivity to the ERK inhibitor, suggest-

ing that downstream inhibition at the level of ERK1/2
can overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance in the
same cell (Fig. 4B).

Ampliﬁcation of BRAF has also been shown to underlie
resistance to MEK and RAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant
tumors, in which RAF plus MEK inhibitor combinations
are currently being tested in clinical trials with promising
results (8, 33). Because ERK inhibitors remained effective
in K-ras mutant ampliﬁed cells, we next sought to deter-
mine whether they would remain effective in MEK
inhibitor resistant, BRAF mutant ampliﬁed cells. A
previous report showed that BRAF mutant colorectal
cancer COLO206F cells with acquired resistance to the
AZD-6244 MEK inhibitor (COLO206F-AR) displayed
10 to 15 copies of mutant BRAF (8). We treated
COLO206F parental and COLO206F-AR MEK-resistant
cells with the 2 MEK inhibitors, the ERK inhibitor and
the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (34). We found that, in
contrast to MEK and BRAF inhibitors, the ERK inhib-
itor again largely maintained its ability to block pro-
liferation and pathway suppression at
the level of
pRSK in the BRAF-ampliﬁed COLO206F-AR cells, with
only an approximately 4-fold shift in sensitivity to
ERKi relative to parental cells compared with a 125-

to 150-fold shift in sensitivity to the 2 MEK inhibitors
(Fig. 5 and Table 2). These data further supported the
conclusion that mechanisms resulting in activation of
the MAPK pathway at several nodes (K-Ras, B-Raf, and

MEK) can all be overcome by downstream blockade of
the MAPK pathway at the level of ERK1/2.

Combination strategies to overcome acquired MEK
inhibitor resistance

An important question in cancer management is wheth-
er rational combinations of therapy given at the onset of
therapy can delay or prevent resistance, or whether such
combinations can overcome acquired resistance. To
address the ﬁrst question, we carried out short-term
selection of MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of MEKi
alone, ERKi alone, or the combination of MEKi and ERKi.
After 9 days of culture, we found signiﬁcantly fewer
resistant cells surviving in the presence of the combination
versus either inhibitor alone (Fig. 6A). To address the
second question, we treated the MEK-R cell
lines
described in this study with a combination of ERKi

Figure 6. Dual inhibition of MEK and ERK abrogates de novo resistance and has synergistic effects on acquired resistance. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
for 9 days with the indicated inhibitors as single agents or in combination at a concentration of 2.5X IC50 with media changed every 3 days. Surviving cells were
quantitated at the end of the experiment. B, MEK-R cells treated with MEK/ERK inhibitors as single agents and in combination across a range of
concentrations. Percent inhibition is shown for each well and color coded based on the scale provided, with blue indicating no inhibition and red indicating
100% inhibition of cell viability. BLISS scores more than 0 indicate greater than additive effects. C, dual MEK and ERK inhibition is a strategy to more effectively
shut down MAPK pathway ﬂux, both in the context of naive MAPK-driven tumor cells (left) as well as in the context of acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors, by
MEK mutation and/or upstream oncogene ampliﬁcation (Mutant K-ras or BRAF).

and MEKi. Combination effects were assessed in cell
viability assays conducted across a matrixed array of
concentrations of each compound. This approach allows
visualization of percent inhibition at each combination of
concentrations, as well as calculation of measures of
synergy such as the Bliss independence model (35). Under
Bliss independence, the fractional inhibition from a com-
bination of 2 agents at speciﬁc concentrations is pre-
dicted as the sum of the inhibitions of each agent
applied alone at the speciﬁc concentrations minus the
product of those single-agent inhibitions (36). Devia-
tions from additive effects in each well can be summed
across the plate to give an overall Bliss score, with
positive Bliss scores indicating greater than additive
effects. We found that the MEKi þ ERKi combination
showed enhanced inhibition of cell growth compared
with single-agent treatment in all 3 MEK-R cell lines
(Fig. 6B). The effect was additive in HCT-116 MEK-R
cells and synergistic (Bliss score > 0) in MDA-MB-231
and LoVo MEK-R cells. Therefore, the MEK–ERK inhib-
itor combination offers the potential of enhanced tumor
growth inhibition and delayed resistance in treatment-
naive patients, as well as enhanced inhibition in the
setting of acquired MEK inhibitor resistance.

Discussion

Somatic activation of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK path-
way is a major driving event that underlies the initiation
and continued expression of the malignant phenotype in
neoplastic cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pathway
with selective inhibitors of MEK or BRAF potently sup-
presses growth of cancer cell lines harboring oncogenic
activation of the pathway, such as those with K-ras and
BRAF mutations (37). A number of agents targeting RAF
and MEK have entered the clinic. BRAF inhibitors in
particular have shown impressive clinical responses in
patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma. For instance,
treatment of metastatic melanoma patients with the selec-
tive inhibitor RG7204 has resulted in partial or complete
tumor responses in nearly 80% of patients and extended
progression-free survival from 2 months to at least 7
months (38). However, almost all patients eventually
develop resistance and progressive worsening of disease,
driven by the reactivation of the MAPK pathway in a
BRAFV600E–independent manner (3). As such, there is a
pressing need for therapeutic strategies that can prevent
the onset of resistance or overcome diverse resistance
mechanisms once they have arisen.

Our observations, derived from multiple models,
suggest that K-ras mutant tumors with acquired MEK
inhibitor resistance often remain addicted to the MAPK
pathway, as opposed to activating alternative redundant
pathways. This is consistent with a recent report show-
ing that in K-Ras mutant colorectal lines, PI3K pathway
activity is driven by receptor tyrosine kinase rather
than mutant K-Ras signaling (39). Furthermore, we show
for the ﬁrst time that selective ERK inhibitors can over-

come this resistance and thus that ERK inhibition may
constitute a therapeutic option for treating patients who
have progressed on MEK inhibitor therapy and show
reactivation of MAPK signaling. Previous studies linking
allosteric site MEK point mutations to MEK inhibitor
resistance used site-directed mutagenesis followed by
overexpression of mutants and focused on a BRAFV600E
background (11). Our study validates these mutations
as a resistance mechanism by showing that they can
arise spontaneously during long-term selection of K-ras
mutant cells in the presence of MEK inhibitors. To-
gether, these results suggest that mutational alteration
of the target may be a common mechanism of resistance
to MEK inhibitors in the clinic and provide a strong
rationale for testing MEK mutation status, in parallel with
other described resistance mechanisms, upon patient
relapse.

Importantly, we show that MEK inhibitor–resistant
cells can exhibit multiple concurrent resistance mechan-
isms in distinct clones within the same HCT-116 MEK-
resistant tumor pool, namely the presence of 2 distinct
MEK allosteric point mutations in a subset of clones and a
MEK1 allosteric point mutation concurrently with high-
level KRAS ampliﬁcation in another subset. This is in
contrast to a previous report suggesting that resistance
in this model could be explained solely by KRAS ampli-
ﬁcation (33), suggesting that perhaps diverse mechanisms
of resistance can arise under different experimental con-
ditions. Importantly, treatment with an ERK inhibitor
could still effectively inhibit HCT-116 MEK-R cells despite
the presence of both upstream alterations. Why ERK
inhibitors remain effective in the context of upstream
oncogene ampliﬁcation, although MEK inhibitors become
less potent, is not entirely clear. We hypothesize that this
phenomenon may be related to the fact that activation of
MEK by these upstream oncogenes may change the
steady-state conformation of MEK in a way that limits
the accessibility of the allosteric binding pocket to MEK
inhibitors (40). The ERK inhibitor described here is ATP
competitive and may be less sensitive to altered confor-
mation dynamics of activated ERK in the context of
upstream oncogene ampliﬁcation.

Clinical inhibition of MEK and BRAF is at an exciting
crossroads with several examples of agents that have
meaningful antitumor activity and survival beneﬁt.
Acquired resistance to these agents is a pressing issue,
and we propose that ERK inhibitors can be valuable
tools in combating BRAF and MEK inhibitor resistance.
Our study is the ﬁrst to provide preclinical evidence that
administering combinations of MEK and ERK inhibitors
in naive cells can prevent or delay the emergence of
acquired resistance (Fig. 6C), as previously observed
in the context of MEK/RAF inhibitor combinations
(8, 11). Furthermore, we found that MEK/ERK inhibitor
combinations can also be used to overcome acquired
resistance, suggesting a treatment paradigm for patients
who have progressed on single-agent MEK or BRAF
inhibitor therapy. Additive or overlapping toxicity due

to vertical inhibition of 2 pathway components may be
a concern with such an approach, though we note that
the clinical combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors
has thus far been clinically well tolerated (41), boding
well
for MEK/ERK clinical combinations. Overall,
these data further highlight the beneﬁts of targeting
multiple nodes within the MAPK pathway for achieving
lasting responses in MAPK-addicted tumors and under-
score the need to understand which of the various
resistance mechanisms are at work in a given patient.
Such efforts will require sustained commitment to the
collection of serial biopsies at the time of disease pro-
gression, to identify the most appropriate therapy upon
relapse.
