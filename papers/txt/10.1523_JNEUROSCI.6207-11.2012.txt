Myelination is a complex process requiring coordination of directional motility and an increase in glial cell size to generate a multila-
mellar myelin sheath. Regulation of actin dynamics during myelination is poorly understood. However, it is known that myelin thickness
is related to the abundance of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) expressed on the axon surface. Here we identify cofilin1, an actin depolymerizing and
severing protein, as a downstream target of NRG1 signaling in rat Schwann cells (SCs). In isolated SCs, NRG1 promotes dephosphoryla-
tion of cofilin1 and its upstream regulators, LIM kinase (LIMK) and Slingshot-1 phosphatase (SSH1), leading to cofilin1 activation and
recruitment to the leading edge of the plasma membrane. These changes are associated with rapid membrane expansion yielding a
35–50% increase in SC size within 30 min. Cofilin1-deficient SCs increase phosphorylation of ErbB2, ERK, focal adhesion kinase, and
paxillin in response to NRG1, but fail to increase in size possibly due to stabilization of unusually long focal adhesions. Cofilin1-deficient
SCs cocultured with sensory neurons do not myelinate. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that they unsuccessfully segregate or engage
axons and form only patchy basal lamina. After 48 h of coculturing with neurons, cofilin1-deficient SCs do not align or elongate on axons
and often form adhesions with the underlying substrate. This study identifies cofilin1 and its upstream regulators, LIMK and SSH1, as end
targets of a NRG1 signaling pathway and demonstrates that cofilin1 is necessary for dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton needed for axon
engagement and myelination by SCs.

Introduction
Myelination is a highly specialized form of cell motility in which
protrusive expansion of the leading edge of the inner mesaxon,
accompanied by high rates of membrane synthesis, drives the
glial membrane repeatedly around the axon to generate the my-
elin sheath. The hypothesis that movement of the leading edges in
cell motility and myelination involve similar mechanisms is sup-
ported by experiments from the author showing a requirement for
actin polymerization in myelination (Fernandez-Valle et al., 1997). This
idea is supported by the essential role of Rho GTPases, molecular
switches that regulate actin dynamics during cell motility, in myelina-
tion (Hall, 2005; Nodari et al., 2007).

A plethora of signaling pathways controlling actin polymeriza-
tion have been identified in motile processes ranging from che-
motaxis to growth cone path finding (von Philipsborn and
Bastmeyer, 2007). However, the pathways linking axon contact to
expansion of the Schwann cell (SC) or oligodendrocyte leading edge
have not been elucidated. Key molecules directly regulating
actin dynamics and organization include cofilin and actin-
depolymerizing factor (ADF), also known as destrin (Oser and Con-
deelis, 2009). These proteins sever and depolymerize actin filaments
to generate new barbed ends to initiate actin polymerization. Al-
though the activities of cofilin and ADF are similar and the proteins
are often coexpressed in cells, they have significant functional and
regulatory differences (Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010).

Cofilin1, the major form expressed in nonmuscle cells, is regu-
lated in several ways; the best characterized is phosphorylation on
serine 3 (pS3-cofilin1) that inhibits its F-actin activity (Huang et al.,
2006). LIM kinases (LIMKs) 1 and 2, and the related testis kinase
phosphorylate cofilin1 S3. LIMKs are serine/threonine kinases con-
taining two LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec3) domains and a PDZ do-
main. They are activated by phosphorylation on T505/508 by p21-
activated kinase (PAK1 and 4) downstream of Cdc42 and Rac
(Edwards et al., 1999; Dan et al., 2001), and by Rho-dependent ki-
nase (ROCK) (Ohashi et al., 2000). Cofilin1 activity is also inhibited
by binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the
plasma membrane (Yonezawa et al., 1990) and the scaffold protein

NRG1 promotes dephosphorylation of cofilin, LIMK2, and SSH1 in SCs. A, Subconfluent normal (WT-SC) cultures
grown on PLL-coated wells were starved of serum and mitogens overnight by incubation in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS (D0.5).
They were stimulated with D0.5 plus NRG1 (NRG) or with fresh D0.5 plus NRG1 carrier (Mock) for the indicated times and were
extracted in SDS sample buffer. Equal volumes were used in Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies recognizing total
and phosphorylated epitopes (pS3-cofilin and pY1248-ErbB2) and GAPDH. S100 was used as an SC marker. B, Quantification of the
global changes in phosphorylation following NRG1 stimulation is shown. The graph depicts the mean and SEM of the ratio of
normalized phosphorylated/total protein in four independent experiments for each time point. C, Subconfluent WT SCs grown on
PLL were starved and stimulated as above for 30 min in the presence and absence of (20 ␮M) AG825, an ErbB2 inhibitor. Western
blots were performed with total and phospho-antibodies (pS978-SSH1 and pT505/508-LIMK1/2). D, The mean and SEM of the
normalized ratio of phosphorylated to total protein after normalization of each to the Mock condition is shown for four indepen-
dent experiments. NRG1 promotes ErbB2 phosphorylation and cofilin dephosphorylation with similar time courses. AG825 inhibits
ErbB2 phosphorylation and decreases dephosphorylation of cofilin, LIMK, and SSH1. *p ⬍ 0.05; **p ⬍ 0.01; ***p ⬍ 0.001;

14-3-3 (Gohla and Bokoch, 2002). Stimulation of cofilin1 activity by
dephosphorylation of serine 3 is conducted by Slingshot1 (SSH1)
(Niwa et al., 2002) and chronophin phosphatases (Gohla et al.,
2005). Previous studies revealed a role for pS3-cofilin1 in phos-
pholipid signaling (Han et al., 2007; Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010).
Therefore, both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of
cofilin1 have potential functional activities in SCs.

A key molecule controlling myelination is neuregulin-1
(NRG1)-type III. Myelin thickness is influenced by the amount of
NRG1-type III expressed on the axon’s surface (Michailov et al.,
2004; Taveggia et al., 2005). This membrane-anchored NRG1
isoform activates ErbB3/ErbB2 receptors that likely regulate SC
motility around the axon, in addition to SC precursor survival
and proliferation (Birchmeier and Nave, 2008).

Here we report that cofilin1 is activated downstream of NRG1
signaling. Isolated cofilin1-deficient SCs activate NRG1 and laminin
(LAM) signaling pathways, proliferate normally, assume a bipolar
phenotype, and form focal adhesions. However, when cocultured
with sensory neurons, cofilin1-deficient SCs fail to effectively engage
or align on axons, assemble a typical basal lamina, or produce
myelin.

Preparation of primary rat SCs. Primary rat
(Rattus norvegicus) SCs were isolated from sci-
atic nerves of 1-d-old Sprague Dawley (Charles
River Laboratories) pups of both sexes using
the Brockes method (Brockes et al., 1979) with
modifications described previously (Thaxton et al., 2011). Purified rat
SCs were routinely cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 on 200 ␮g/ml poly-L-
lysine (PLL)-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) dishes (Corning) in D10M
[DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HIFBS), 15 ␮M
forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ␮g/ml bovine pituitary extract, and peni-
cillin/streptomycin (P/S; Invitrogen)].

Generation of cofilin1-deficient Schwann cell lines. Freshly harvested
and purified rat SCs were plated onto PLL-coated (200 ␮g/ml) six-well
dishes, cultured in D10M, and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. When
the cultures reached 70 – 80% confluency, lentiviral transduction parti-
cles expressing various cofilin1 shRNAi were added at various multiplic-
ities of infection (MOIs) ranging from 0.5 to 10 in D10M plus 8 ␮g/ml
hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). After 18 –20 h, the infection
medium was replaced with fresh D10M for 24 h. D10M was then replaced
with D10M containing 1 ␮g/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for the se-
lection of transduced cells. SCs were maintained in D10M plus puromy-
cin and passaged (1:3 split) to expand the populations. During
expansion, the cofilin1 expression level was assessed by extracting SCs
directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and conducting Western blot anal-
ysis. ShRNAi target 94 was found to be the most efficient in reducing
cofilin1 levels and was used to generate several independently derived SC
lines (SC-94). SCs expressing scrambled (SCR) shRNAi did not consis-
tently grow well. Therefore, SCs expressing shRNAi target 97 (SC-97)
were used in most experiments to control for the effects of lentiviral
transduction, puromycin selection, and passage number. SC-97 cells re-
mained functional as long as cofilin1 expression dropped by no more

than 30% of normal levels and cells were passaged no more than 10 times.
The presence of puromycin in the culture medium had the added benefit
of eliminating fibroblasts. Independent SC lines were created on seven
different occasions with different batches of lentiviral transduction par-
ticles. The degree of cofilin1 knockdown and cell function obtained with
each target shRNAi was similar each time.

Preparation of dissociated rat DRG neuron/SC cocultures. Dorsal root
ganglia (DRGs) were harvested from Sprague Dawley rat (Charles River
Laboratories) embryos at 17 d of gestation [embryonic day 17 (E17)] and
were dissociated as described previously (Thaxton et al., 2011). Dissoci-
ated DRG neurons (DRGNs) were plated on PLL (200 ␮g/ml) plus
laminin (50 ␮g/ml; Invitrogen) or PLL plus collagen-coated (3.4 mg/ml,
type I; BD Biosciences) 12 mm German glass coverslips (Carolina Bio-
logical) in CB5 medium (MEM, 0.4% glucose, 50 ng/ml 2.5S NGF and
5% HIFBS). For myelination assays, dissociated DRGN cultures were
seeded with primary rat SCs or cofilin1-deficient SCs at 2 ⫻ 10 5 SCs per
coverslip in CB10 medium (CB with 10% HIFBS). Cocultures were then
switched to myelin-permissive medium (CB with 15% HIFBS plus 0.05
mg/ml L-ascorbic acid) and were fixed 10 –14 d later for ultrastructural
analysis, immunostaining, or Sudan black staining.

NRG1 stimulation and Western blot analysis. Normal [wild-type (WT)]
SCs and cofilin1-deficient SC lines were plated on PLL-coated (200 ␮g/
ml) six-well dishes and were grown in D10M to 50 – 60% confluency
(typically 72–96 h after plating). Cultures were starved of serum and
mitogens by rinsing twice in warmed HBSS (Invitrogen) and incubating
in D0.5 (DMEM plus P/S plus 0.5% HIFBS). Eighteen to 22 h later,
duplicate wells were stimulated for the indicated times at 37°C and 5%
CO2 with D0.5 plus NRG1 carrier (PBS plus 0.02% BSA; mock medium)
or D0.5 plus 10 –25 ng/ml NRG1-ECD (NRG medium). For the AG825
inhibitor treatment, starved cultures were preincubated with AG825 (10
␮M) in D0.5 for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and stimulated in the presence
of the inhibitor. Following stimulation, wells were washed twice in PBS
(Invitrogen) with phosphatase inhibitors (PIC3; Sigma-Aldrich) and
were extracted directly in SDS sample buffer (Fermentas). Equal sam-
ple volumes were loaded on 4 –20% precast (Pierce) or 10% self-cast
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore). HRP-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Jackson Im-
munoResearch) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Sub-
strate (Pierce) were used for detection. Western blots were quantified
using Carestream Molecular Imaging software (version 5.0). The net
intensity of equivalent-sized regions of interest for phosphorylated and
total proteins was obtained and normalized to GAPDH. Statistical anal-
ysis was performed from four independent experiments with GraphPad
Prism 5. Stimulation experiments were analyzed using two-way ANOVA
and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Stimulation experiments us-
ing the AG825 inhibitor were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and
Tukey’s multiple comparison test. We found that multiple factors influ-
enced the consistency of the amount of phosphorylation changes. These
included cell confluency, passage number, length of the starvation pe-
riod, and activity of NRG1. The activity of the NRG1 was titered before
use and stored no longer than 2–3 weeks after reconstitution of the
lyophilized compound. The strongest responses were observed with SC
cultures at no more than 60% confluency, passaged no more than five
times (1:3 splits), and starved for a minimum of 20 h. Nonstimulated WT
SCs and cofilin1-deficient lines were seeded on six-well dishes coated
with PLL (200 ␮g/ml) or PLL (200 ␮g/ml) plus LAM (25 ␮g/ml) and
were grown to 60 –70% confluency in D10M. Proteins were extracted in
chilled TAN buffer (10 mM Tris-acetate, 1% IGEPAL, and 100 mM NaCl,
with a mixture of inhibitors) following two washes in chilled PBS on ice.
Three to 5 ␮g of total protein was loaded on 4 –20% precast polyacryl-
amide gels (Pierce) and transferred to Immobilon-FL membranes (Mil-
lipore). Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences), and secondary
IRDye antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) were used, and membranes were
scanned and quantified using LI-COR Odyssey scanner and software.

Immunofluorescence staining of cultures. WT-SC, SC-94, and SC-97
cultures and DRGN/SC cocultures were immunostained as described
previously (Thaxton et al., 2007). After fixation with 4% paraformalde-
hyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, myelinating cocultures were acetone
treated at ⫺20°C with sequential exposure to 50%/100%/50% acetone

blocked for 1 h in block buffer: 0.1 M phosphate buffer plus 10% normal
goat serum (Invitrogen). Myelinating cocultures immunostained for ex-
tracellular matrix proteins were neither permeabilized nor acetone
treated. Following blocking, SC-only and nonmyelinating cocultures
were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, while multilayered myeli-
nating cocultures were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies
(goat-Alexa Fluor; Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in block buffer were applied
for 30 min. Cultures were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min,
stained with DAPI and, if applicable, Alexa 633-phalloidin, and were
mounted in Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). All cultures were
analyzed with a Zeiss LSM710 microscope and ZEN 2009 software. Image
acquisition was optimized for each antibody in triple- or quadruple-
stained cultures, and fluorescence was collected on separate channels.
Images were identically acquired and processed for WT-SC, SC-94, and
SC-97 cocultures, and are either single planes or maximum intensity
projections as indicated in the figure legends. Focal contact/adhesion

pixel intensities colocalized with DAPI-stained nuclei) expression. Five
fields were analyzed for both sets of cocultures. Data were analyzed with
GraphPad Prism 5, Student’s t test.

NRG1 stimulation-cell size assay. WT SCs were seeded onto PLL-coated
(200 ␮g/ml) 12 mm round coverslips at 5000 SCs per coverslip in D10M.
Twenty-four hours later, cultures were starved for 16–18 h and then stimu-
lated as described above for 30 min, fixed, and immunostained. For analysis,
50 individual SCs from three cultures per condition were imaged using a
20⫻ objective. Images were analyzed using Volocity 5.5 software to measure
the two-dimensional size of individual cells lacking contacts with neighbor-
ing SCs. The area was averaged for both mock- and NRG1-stimulated
groups, and NRG-stimulated SC size was normalized to mock SCs. Four
independent experiments were performed; p values (unpaired t test)
were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5. SC-94 and SC-97 cells were
seeded onto PLL- and PLL/laminin-coated 12 mm coverslips, grown
for 24 h, starved for 16 –18 h, and then stimulated as above for 30 min
and immunostained as described above. Phalloidin-Alexa 633 fluo-

rescence was used to calculate cell area from isolated cells (n ⫽ 16 – 40
cells in each condition) in three independent experiments. Statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5, one-way ANOVA,
and Tukey’s multiple comparison test.

Live imaging, cell attachment, and spreading assay. WT SCs and SC-97 and
SC-94 cells were lifted by incubation in 0.05% trypsin, allowed to recover in
D10M for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, and seeded onto a MatTek 12-well plate
coated with PLL (200 ␮g/ml) and laminin (25 ␮g/ml), with a 10 mm glass
insert at 5000 cells per insert. They were immediately placed on a Zeiss
wide-field microscope with full incubation control. Three to five fields were
selected for each cell type, and images were collected with a Hamamatsu
ORCA camera every 3 min for 3 h using a10⫻ phase objective and Zeiss
AxioVision 4.8.2 software. Volocity 5.5 software was used to quantitate size
(number of pixels) of individual cells. Four experiments were analyzed, and
the mean number of pixels, SEM (n ⫽ 7 for each field), and p values (un-
paired t test) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.

Sudan black staining. DRGN/SC cocultures were prepared and ana-
lyzed as described by Chen et al. (2000). For analysis, coverslips were

5288 • J. Neurosci., April 11, 2012 • 32(15):5284 –5297

photographed with a 20⫻ objective; nine of the
most heavily myelinated fields were imaged on
4 –16 coverslips of each WT-SC, SC-97, and
SC-94 coculture. Myelin segments in each im-
age were manually counted and summed for
each coverslip in four independent experiments.
The mean, SEM, and p values (unpaired t test)
were calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs
Software.

Electron microscopy. DRGN/SC cocultures
were prepared essentially as described by
Fernandez-Valle et al. (1997). The glass cover-
slips were removed by dissolving them in hy-
drofluoric acid under a fume hood. Areas of
cocultures containing neurite fascicles were
selected for analysis and were either cross-
sectioned or sectioned en face. Three indepen-
dent cocultures with WT SCs and SC-94 and
SC-97 cells prepared with an MOI of 5 were ana-
lyzed by electron microscopy.

Schwann cell–axon alignment assays. DRGNs
cultures were seeded with WT SCs and SC-97 and
SC-94 cells labeled with CellTracker Green
(CTG; Invitrogen). Labeling was performed ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s protocol. For ex-
periments using the LIMK inhibitor (BMS-5),
labeled SCs were washed once in CB10 contain-
ing 1 ␮M BMS-5 before seeding in the same
medium. After 24 h, the cocultures were immu-
nostained with neurofilament antibody and
mounted as usual. For analysis, 10 randomly se-
lected fields spanning the entire culture were im-
aged with a 20⫻ objective from three cultures per
condition. SC morphology was visually assessed
for ⬃100 SCs in each type of coculture as bipolar,
tripolar, or multipolar by counting the number of
processes emanating from the SC soma. The re-
sults shown for the noninhibitor study is a mean
of three experiments, while the BMS-5 study is
representative of two experiments. The mean,
SEM, and p values (unpaired t test) were calcu-
lated using GraphPad Prism 5. For clarity, in Fig-
ure 10B, the expression of pS3-cofilin1 is shown
only for SCs (pS3-cofilin1 fluorescence that colo-
calized with neurofilament fluorescence was
subtracted after acquisition using ZEN 2009
software). pS3-Cofilin mean fluorescence in-
tensity per cell was quantified using Volocity
5.5 software from 30 fields per condition.

Inhibitor dose response and Western blot anal-
ysis. WT SCs were seeded on PLL-coated (200
␮g/ml) six-well plates and incubated at 37°C
and 5% CO2 to 80 –90% confluency in D10M.
The medium was then replaced with fresh me-
dium with and without serial dilutions of the
LIMK inhibitor, BMS-5, and incubated for an
additional 4 h. The control condition received

Cofilin is required for SC myelination.A, In four separate experiments, DRGN/SC cocultures were assessed for myelination by
Sudan black staining after 10–14 d of growth in myelin-permissive medium. SC-97 (top) robustly myelinated sensory axons, whereas
SC-94 (bottom) myelinated very infrequently. At higher magnification (right), SC-94 cells have rounded nuclei rather than oval nuclei as is
typical for myelinating SCs. The oval nuclear shape of myelinating SC-97 is somewhat obscured but is visible in the cells indicated with

(hereafter referred to as cofilin) activity, we stimulated subcon-
fluent starved normal SCs (WT SCs) with NRG1 for 5, 15, 30, and
60 min. WT SCs were also mock stimulated with the NRG1 car-
rier alone (mock). Equivalent volumes of lysate were analyzed by
Western blot for phosphorylated and total levels of ErbB2 and
cofilin (Fig. 1A). ErbB2 phosphorylation increased within 5 min
of NRG1 stimulation and remained at three times the basal level
for at least 1 h. pS3-Cofilin levels decreased by 50% within 5 min
of NRG1 stimulation and remained at 30 –50% of basal levels
throughout the 1 h time course (Fig. 1B). To confirm that cofilin
was dephosphorylated in response to ErbB2 activation, WT SCs
were stimulated with NRG1 for 30 min in the presence and ab-
sence of an ErbB2 kinase inhibitor, AG825 (Osherov et al., 1993)
(Fig. 1C,D). AG825 (10 ␮M) inhibited both the phosphorylation
of ErbB2 and the dephosphorylation of pS3-cofilin associated
with NRG1 stimulation. NRG1 also promoted dephosphoryla-
tion of LIMK2 (T508) and SSH1 (S978) within 30 min of stimu-
lation. Dephosphorylation of each protein was partially inhibited
by AG825. The predominant isoform of LIMK detected in SCs
was found to be LIMK2, and dephosphorylation of T508 reduced
its kinase activity. SSH1 was expressed in SCs, and dephosphor-
ylation of S978 activated its phosphatase activity. Thus, NRG1
promotes rapid dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin’s ac-
tin depolymerizing and severing activity by regulating the activi-
ties of both LIMK2 and SSH1.

NRG1 promotes SC spreading and recruitment of cofilin to
the leading edge
We next analyzed the cellular response of WT SCs to 30 min of
NRG1 stimulation. WT SCs were immunostained with antibod-
ies to total cofilin, ErbB2, SSH1, LIMK2, and paxillin, and F-actin
was visualized with phalloidin. We observed that NRG1 induced
formation of membrane protrusions and cell spreading. We used
paxillin immunofluorescence to measure cell size and observed a
35 ⫾ 6% (p ⬍ 0.01; n ⫽ 4 experiments) increase in the size of
NRG1-stimulated SCs compared to mock-stimulated SCs. Cofi-
lin was present at the leading edge of the plasma membrane and
membrane protrusions in NRG1-stimulated but not in mock-
stimulated SCs (Fig. 2). pS3-Cofilin antibody did not label the
plasma membrane of NRG1-stimulated SCs (data not shown),
suggesting that plasma membrane-associated cofilin is active.
ErbB2 and SSH1 were present at the leading edge of stimulated
SCs, whereas LIMK2 was not detected at the leading edge and
remained in the cytosol and processes. These results are consis-
tent with the conclusion that NRG1 induces expansion of the SC
plasma membrane by promoting cofilin recruitment, dephos-
phorylation, and activation at the leading edge.

Cofilin is essential for SC myelination
To test the role of cofilin during myelination, we created cofilin-
deficient SC lines using lentiviral delivery of cofilin shRNAi. Of
the five target shRNAi tested, we found that shRNAi 94 reliably
reduced cofilin protein levels by 80 –90% of normal levels at an
MOI of 5 (Fig. 3A–C). Cofilin shRNAi targets 95, 96, 97, and SCR
promoted modest reductions in cofilin expression (10 to 30%
decrease) at an MOI of 5. ShRNAi targets 94, 97, and SCR were
used to generate passage-matched SC lines for analysis. Phalloi-
din staining and cofilin immunofluorescence revealed an
increase in F-actin stress fibers and cell size in freshly plated,
PLL-adherent, cofilin-deficient SC-94 cells compared to control
SC-97 cells (Fig. 3D). In adhesion and spreading studies, we
found that SC-94 cells adhered to laminin more quickly than
SC-97 cells (compare sizes at 0.5 h) and elaborated more plasma

membrane than SC-97 cells, becoming twice as large as SC-97
cells at 3.5 h of plating (Fig. 3F,G). However, when SC-94 cells
reached a high cell density, they aligned with each other as bipolar
cells and were morphologically indistinguishable from SC-97
(Fig. 3H) and WT SCs (data not shown). We also did not observe
differences among SC-94, SC-97, and passage-matched WT SCs
in proliferation rates and cell-cycle progression as assessed with
propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (data not shown).
To assess the role of cofilin in myelination, we seeded dissoci-
ated DRGN cultures with SC-94 and SC-97 and allowed them to
develop for 10 –14 d in myelination-permissive medium. Sudan
black stained myelin sheaths were quantified in four experiments
(Fig. 4A; Table 1). We found that SC-94 cells were largely unable
to produce myelin under conditions that supported myelination
by SC-97 and WT SCs (data not shown). In areas of the coculture
with large axon fascicles, SC-94 cells appeared to associate with
axons but did not elongate along them. An easily observable
change in morphology that accompanies SC alignment and dif-
ferentiation into the myelinating phenotype is nuclear elonga-
tion. This change in nuclear morphology was infrequently
observed in SC-94 cells maintained for 10 –14 d in myelination-
permissive medium (Fig. 4A). MAG was expressed at a low level
by SC-94 cells, but it was not assembled into myelin (Fig. 4B). An
occasional MBP-positive SC was observed in SC-94 cocultures;
however, the immunostaining pattern of the MBP-positive seg-
ments was abnormally thin and short (Fig. 4C). The occasional
myelin segments could have been synthesized by SC-94 cells
expressing relatively higher cofilin levels (Fig. 3E) or residual
normal SCs from the purified DRGN cultures. In contrast, SC-97
and SC-SCR cells expressed MAG and MBP that were assembled
into typical myelin sheaths. We also assessed whether SC-94 cells
expressed Krox-20/Egr2, a myelin-specific transcription factor.
Surprisingly, the Krox-20 expression level was higher in SC-94
than in SC-97 cocultures; however, it largely localized to the cy-
tosol rather than the nucleus (Fig. 4D,E). Last, the number of SCs
in the cocultures was counted to determine whether SC-94 cells
failed to proliferate in contact with axons. Cell number was de-
termined on the day after seeding onto neuron cultures as well as
at the end of the 10 d myelinating period (Table 2). No differences
in the number of SC-94 and SC-97 cells in the cocultures were
found. These results indicate that SC-94 cells proliferate in re-

fail

We conducted electron microscopic
analysis of the cocultures to assess the
degree of morphological differentiation
of SC-97 versus SC-94 (Fig. 5). In cross-
sections, both WT SCs and SC-97 cells
(Fig. 5 A, B, respectively) produced com-
pact myelin. In contrast, SC-94 cells demon-
strated limited and abnormal development
(Fig. 5C). Large-diameter axons often re-
mained unsegregated (a1, a2), and many
SC-94 processes failed to adhere to axons
(exemplified by processes 1 and 2). A single
SC-94 cell engulfed multiple relatively large-
diameter axons (a3–a5) while simultane-
ously extending processes around other
axons (processes 1, 2, and 6). This morphol-
ogy indicates a failure to establish a one-to-
one relationship with an axon. Additionally,
this SC-94 cell produced 1.5 wraps around
each of the larger-diameter axons (a3, a4)
but the cytoplasmic processes were not po-
larized into typical mesaxons. A discontin-
uous basal
lamina was also observed
(Fig. 5C, inset, arrowheads). Whereas this
amount of basal lamina deposition is not
unusual for cocultures at this stage of devel-
opment, the observed detached basal lam-
ina is unusual. Ultrastructural analysis of en
face sections of the cocultures (Fig. 5D,E)
confirmed the inability of SC-94 processes
to form continuous close appositions with
the axonal membrane. SC-97 cells formed
close contacts with the axolemma (Fig. 5D,
arrows); however, the processes of SC-94
cells did not adhere consistently to the
axon leaving stretches of the axolemma bare
(E, arrows). The ultrastructural findings
suggest that cofilin-deficient SCs fail to my-
elinate because they are unable to effectively
regulate process extension, adhere to axons,
and form typical basal lamina.

Cofilin-deficient SCs have abnormal
organization of CTIV and laminin
Because basal
laminin formation and
actin polymerization are needed for expres-
sion of myelin-specific genes (Fernandez-
Valle et al., 1994, 1997), and detached
basal lamina was observed in the ultrastructural analysis, the abil-
ity of SC-94 cells to secrete and organize basal lamina compo-
nents was assessed by immunostaining. WT SCs and SC-97 and
SC-94 cells were cocultured with sensory neurons and grown
for 10 d in myelination-permissive medium. Cocultures were
fixed but not permeabilized before immunostaining with anti-
bodies to CTIV and laminin. We found differences in the abun-
dance and organization of CTIV and laminin in SC-94 cocultures
compared to SC-97 and WT-SC cocultures (Fig. 6) (WT SCs not
shown). CTIV was highly expressed but was organized in patches
in SC-94 cocultures, whereas it had a linear appearance in SC-97
and WT-SC cocultures. Similarly, laminin was secreted and as-

Cofilin is necessary for normal SC–axon interactions. A–E, Ultrastructural analyses were conducted on cross (A–C)
and en face sections (D, E) of DRGN/SC cocultures grown for 10 d in myelin-permissive medium. Whereas WT SCs (A) and SC-97 cells
(B) produced normal-appearing myelin within this time frame, SC-94 cells (C) did not. Large-diameter axons were not effectively
segregated by SC-94 (axons a1, a2). SC-94 did not form a one-to-one relationship with axons, but rather elaborated multiple
processes around both large- and small-diameter axons. Numbers indicate separate processes from a single SC-94 cell attempting
to wrap two larger axons and multiple small ones (a3–a5). Arrowheads and the inset show discontinuous basal lamina (C). En face
sections show that SC-97 processes formed tight appositions with axons (D, arrows), whereas SC-94 processes did not adhere well

sembled into linear arrays in SC-97 and WT-SC cocultures, but
had an irregular distribution in SC-94 cocultures. These results
demonstrate that cofilin-deficient SCs secrete but do not prop-
erly organize basal lamina components.

Cofilin-deficient SCs do not align on axons
To better assess the interaction of SC-94 with axons, 10-d-old my-
elinating cocultures were immunostained for the SC-specific marker
S100 and for neurofilament. We observed an unusual organization
of SC-94 cells in the cocultures. Notably, cofilin-negative and S100-
positive SC-94 cells adhered to the laminin substrate forming a
monolayer of flat, wide bipolar cells. They did however, extend

mally contacted the underlying laminin substrate. To further in-
vestigate the ability of SC-94 cells to interact with axons, we
conducted axon-alignment assays using CTG-labeled SCs grown
with DRGN cultures for 24 h (Fig. 8A,B). We found that SC-97
cells, expressing 90% of normal cofilin levels, assumed a bipolar
morphology within 24 h of seeding onto DRGN cultures. How-
ever, SC-94 cells, expressing only 20% of normal cofilin levels,
were multipolar, a morphology incompatible with axon align-
ment. When SC-97 lines were prepared with 10 MOI of lentiviral
transduction particles (as opposed to 5 MOI), their cofilin level
dropped to 60% of normal, and the frequency of multipolar SCs
increased in the 24 h assay (data not shown). We also compared
axon alignment of cofilin-deficient SCs after 48 h of seeding on
DRGN cultures grown on laminin versus collagen type 1 (Fig.
8C). SCs and their focal contacts and adhesions were visualized
by immunostaining for vinculin. SC-94 cells failed to align along
axon fascicles regardless of the substrate and the additional time.
SC-97 cells aligned as bipolar cells along axons grown on both
substrates. We noted that SC-94 cells formed vinculin-positive
focal contacts and adhesions on the underlying substrate that
could interfere with axon alignment by possibly sequestering SC
processes. Alternatively, enhanced SC-94 cell adhesion to the
substrate could be secondary to their inability to stabilize processes
on axons. This appears more likely, as SCs are seeded on top of
well-established 12-d-old neuron cultures through which SC pro-
cesses must navigate before reaching the underlying substrate.

To assess whether SC-94 cells expressed normal levels of
ErbB2 and integrin signaling proteins, Western blot analysis of
isolated SC-94, SC-97, and WT SCs grown on laminin were con-
ducted. The results revealed that SC-94 cells were deficient only
in cofilin expression. These SCs expressed equivalent levels of the
cofilin family member, ADF, as well as ErbB2, ERK1, N-cadherin,
SSH1, ␣6 and ␤1 integrins, and the related signaling proteins, FAK
and paxillin, which were both phosphorylated and thus active (Fig.
8D). These results suggests that SC-94 has intact ErbB2 and ␤1 in-
tegrin signaling pathways but is unable to modulate actin dynamics
in response to receptor activity in the absence of cofilin.

Cofilin-deficient SCs do not increase in cell size in response
to NRG1
We analyzed the cellular and biochemical responses of SC-94, SC-
97, and WT SCs grown on PLL and on laminin to 30 min of NRG1
stimulation. The cells were immunostained for vinculin to label ma-
ture focal contacts and adhesions and with phalloidin. We assessed
the number and length of focal contacts/adhesions, changes in
F-actin levels, and cell size (Fig. 9A,B). SC-94 cells formed fewer but
longer focal contacts/adhesions than SC-97 cells on both PLL and
laminin. The vinculin-positive structures present
in mock-
stimulated SC-94 cells had insertions of F-actin stress fibers, which
define them as focal adhesions (Katoh et al., 2011). In contrast, the
vinculin-positive structures formed by SC-97 cells were largely de-
void of stress fibers (Fig. 9A, insets). There was no significant change
in the number or length of FAs between mock- and NRG1-
stimulated conditions for either cell type. NRG1 stimulation gener-
ally resulted in a reduction in the amount of F-actin compared to
mock-stimulated cells that was statistically significant only in SC-97
cells grown on laminin (a 24% decrease). Whereas SC-97 cells in-
creased in size by 50% following NRG1 stimulation on both PLL and
laminin, SC-94 cells did not increase in size when grown on PLL, and
decreased in size when grown on laminin (Fig. 9B). We also assessed
the activity of the ErbB2 and ␤1 integrin signaling pathways in
NRG1-stimulated WT SCs and SC-94 and SC-97 cells grown on PLL
and laminin by Western blot analysis. An increase in ErbB2 phos-

with vinculin (green) to visualize SCs and focal adhesions. Images are single planes of representative areas. SC-94 cells were unable to assume a bipolar morphology and align along
neurons grown on either substrate. D, Total protein extracts of WT SCs and SC-97 and SC-94 cells grown normally for 48 h on LAM were blotted for basal levels of adhesion molecules
(integrins, N-cadherin) and other downstream signaling molecules. Cofilin deficiency did not correlate with an aberrant expression of other proteins, and viral transduction had no effect
on expression levels of the tested proteins. Scale bars: 20 ␮m.

phorylation was detected following NRG1 stimulation for all cells
grown on PLL compared to the mock condition. The increase in
ErbB2 phosphorylation levels was modest for all cells when grown
on laminin due to a higher level of basal activation. SC-94 cells had
comparable increases in phosphorylation of ERK, FAK, and paxillin
to WT SCs and SC-97 cells on both substrates (Fig. 9C). These results
indicate that SC-94 cells initiate ErbB2- and ␤1 integrin-dependent
signaling cascades in response to NRG1, but are unable to extend
plasma membrane and increase in size in the absence of cofilin.

Phosphorylated cofilin is necessary for SC elongation
on axons
We examined the localization and phosphorylation states of co-
filin, LIMK, and SSH1 in normal SCs cultured with axons for
24 h. To distinguish between neuronal and SC-expressed pro-
teins, SCs were prelabeled with CellTracker Green, and axons
were identified by neurofilament expression. Within 24 h of seed-
ing onto axons, high levels of pS3-cofilin, pErbB2, pLIMK, and
pSSH1 were observed in bipolar SC processes contacting axons
(Fig. 10A). In unaligned, multipolar SCs, pS3-cofilin was not
detected in processes and was confined to the perinuclear cytosol

(Fig. 10B). To determine whether cofilin phosphorylation was
needed for SCs to align on axons as bipolar cells, the experiment
was repeated in the presence of BMS-5, a highly selective, potent
LIMK inhibitor (Ross-Macdonald et al., 2008) (Fig. 10C). Immu-
nostaining confirmed a decrease in phosphorylation of cofilin S3
in BMS-5 treated versus carrier-treated SCs (Fig. 10D,E). Fewer
bipolar SCs were observed in 24 h cocultures grown in the pres-
ence of BMS-5 than in control cocultures (Fig. 10F). These re-
sults suggest that phosphorylation of cofilin S3 is needed for SCs
to adopt a stable bipolar morphology in association with axons.

Discussion
The ability to rapidly expand plasma membrane is a unique biolog-
ical function of myelinating SCs. Although myelin thickness has
been genetically linked to the abundance of NRG1 on the axon sur-
face (Michailov et al., 2004), the underlying pathways have not been
elucidated. The present study sheds light on how NRG1 regulates
actin dynamics in isolated SCs to promote expansion of the plasma
membrane and an increase in cell size. Our results demonstrate that
NRG1 rapidly activates cofilin’s F-actin depolymerizing/severing ac-
tivity in SCs and initiates membrane spreading. Moreover, we show

that cofilin is required for the NRG1-induced increase in cell size.
Last, we show that cofilin-deficient SCs are unable to align or my-
elinate sensory axons in vitro; thus. cofilin plays an essential role
during myelination.

NRG1 stimulates a cofilin-dependent increase in SC size
Cofilin directs the site of new membrane expansion by severing and
depolymerizing F-actin to generate new barbed ends for localized
actin polymerization (Oser and Condeelis, 2009). Our conclusions

et al., 2007). An increase in cell size and
F-actin stress fibers subsequent to cofilin
knockdown has been reported in other
cell types (Hotulainen et al., 2005).

SC-94 cells have similar levels of ex-
pression and activation of ErbB2,
N-cadherin, ␣6 and ␤1 integrins and
downstream effectors, ERK1/2, FAK, and
paxillin as SC-97 and WT SCs (Fig. 8).
Thus, pathways needed to respond to
NRG1 appear intact in cofilin-deficient
SCs. The related cofilin molecule ADF is
expressed in SCs, and its expression level
was unaltered following cofilin depletion.
Because ADF did not functionally com-
pensate for cofilin in SC-94 cells, it ap-
pears to have a distinct role in SCs.
Overall, these studies demonstrate that
cofilin is dephosphorylated in response to
NRG1 stimulation and recruited to the
leading edge of isolated SCs, where it par-
ticipates in severing and/or depolymeriz-
ing F-actin to promote directional cell
spreading.

Figure 11. Working model for cofilin function during Schwann cell myelination. We propose that the spatiotemporal balance of
cofilin serine 3 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates actin polymerization dynamics downstream of ErbB2/B3 and ␤1
integrin signaling in Schwann cells contacting axons. Schwann cell alignment on axons is facilitated by shifting the balance toward
cofilin serine 3 phosphorylation that favors F-actin stabilization. In the absence of significant basal lamina deposition, ␣6␤1
integrin and ErbB2/B3 receptors exist as a complex throughout the Schwann cell plasma membrane. Clustered ␤1 integrins
activate Cdc42/Rac-dependent-Pak kinase (Thaxton et al., 2008) that increases LIMK-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin serine
3. As basal lamina develops, the receptors become polarized to opposing plasma membranes. Basal lamina clusters ␣6␤1 integrin
to promote cofilin serine 3 phosphorylation and stabilization of F-actin along the abaxonal plasma membrane. In contrast, NRG1
activation of ErbB2/B3 along the adaxonal plasma membrane inhibits LIMK and promotes SSH1 activity, which shifts the balance
towardcofilinserine3dephosphorylation.Cyclesofcofilinphosphorylationanddephosphorylationattheleadingedgeoftheinner
mesaxon allow expansion of the Schwann cell plasma membrane around the axon during active myelination.

that these activities are activated by NRG1 and required for NRG1-
directed increase in SC size are supported by the results presented in
Figures 1–3 and 9. We show that within 30 min of addition, NRG1
promotes a 35–50% increase in the size of WT SCs and SC-97 cells
with a concomitant decrease in F-actin levels compared to the re-
spective mock-stimulated cells. These morphological changes are
associated with NRG1/ErbB2-dependent dephosphorylation of co-
filin at serine 3 that activates cofilin’s actin-depolymerizing/severing
activity (Figs. 1, 9). The decrease in cofilin phosphorylation arises
from NRG1-stimulated dephosphorylation and inhibition of LIMK
and dephosphorylation and activation of SSH1 (Fig. 1) (Oser and
Condeelis, 2009). Cofilin, but not pS3-cofilin (data not shown), is
concentrated at the leading edge of protrusive membranes along
with ErbB2 and SSH1 phosphatase in WT SCs (Fig. 2). This suggests
that recruitment to and activation of cofilin at the leading edge is
responsible for initiating membrane spreading in response to NRG1.
This conclusion is further supported by the failure of cofilin-
deficient SC-94 cells to increase in size following NRG1 stimulation
(Fig. 9), although their innate ability to adhere and spread nondi-
rectionally on laminin is enhanced compared to SC-97 cells
(Fig. 3). This is consistent with a role for cofilin in localized
membrane protrusions during chemotaxis of motile cells (Ghosh
et al., 2004). For example, cofilin is necessary for the response of
carcinoma cells to EGF gradients (Mouneimne et al., 2006; Sidani

Cofilin is essential for myelination
We hypothesized that cofilin activity
would be necessary for polarized expan-
sion of the SC membrane during myelina-
tion. We sought to test this hypothesis by
coculturing cofilin-deficient SCs with
sensory neurons and assessing their ability
to form a myelin sheath. Surprisingly, we
found that cofilin-deficient SCs are un-
able to even effectively engage axons and
stably appose them. During the initial
24 – 48 h of interaction, SC-94 cells fail to
extend bipolar processes along axons (Fig.
8). Over the following week, SC-94 cells
adhere to the laminin substrate as flattened bipolar cells and de-
velop focal contacts/adhesions. Isolated SC-94 cells form atypi-
cally long focal adhesions on both PLL and laminin compared to
the focal contacts/adhesions formed by SC-97 cells (Fig. 9). It has
been shown that focal adhesion turnover requires cofilin and
F-actin depolymerization (Gupton et al., 2007; Marshall et al.,
2009; Maruthamuthu et al., 2010). The aberrant adhesion and
spreading of SC-94 cells on the substrate could be a consequence
of their inability to stably engage axons in the absence of cofilin
and is discussed below.

While our standard myelination assay is conducted over
10 –14 d, SC-94/DRGN cocultures grown for 4 weeks in myelin-
permissive medium did not further differentiate (data not
shown), indicating that SC-94 cells were not simply delayed in
differentiation. We also did not find differences in the number of
DAPI- and Ki67-positive SC-94 cells in the DRGN cultures com-
pared to controls (Table 2) (data not shown), indicating that
cofilin-deficient SCs proliferate in response to axonal NRG1. Our
analysis of the ErbB2 and ␤1 integrin pathways in isolated SC-94
cells and their ability to proliferate in response to soluble and
axonal-NRG1 suggest that cofilin-deficient SCs activate path-
ways necessary for differentiation but cannot execute directed
morphological changes in the absence of cofilin. This is sup-
ported by the low-level expression of MAG and cytosolic Krox-20

5296 • J. Neurosci., April 11, 2012 • 32(15):5284 –5297

Sparrow, Manetti et al. • Cofilin Is Essential for Schwann Cell Myelination

in SC-94 compared with controls. Translocation of Krox-20 into
the nucleus is regulated by its interaction with 14-3-3 protein that
maintains it in the cytoplasm (Dillon et al., 2007). Because cofilin
directly binds 14-3-3 (Gohla and Bokoch 2002), loss of expres-
sion of this abundant protein in SCs could increase levels of free
14-3-3, thereby perturbing the balance of nuclear/cytosolic
Krox-20 and contributing to the inability of SC-94 cells to
myelinate. Contact between the SC and axon is needed for develop-
ment of basal lamina. The deposition of basal lamina by cofilin-
deficient SCs resembled that reported in studies in which direct
contact between SCs and axons was prevented (Clark and Bunge,
1989). This early study revealed that SCs assemble normal-
appearing basal lamina only when they ensheathe axons. Thus,
the abnormal distribution of laminin and basal lamina in SC-94/
DRGN cocultures could arise from their inability to stably engage
axons as elongated bipolar cells. Abnormal laminin deposition
and consequent aberrant motility have also been reported in ker-
atinocytes and arose from deregulation of ␤4 integrin signaling to
Rac1 and cofilin1 (Sehgal et al., 2006).

Phosphorylated cofilin plays a role in SC engagement
of axons
SC-94 cells retain the ability to extend plasma membrane around
axons but do so in an “unregulated” manner, as shown in Figure
5 and 7. Cofilin-deficient SCs engulf and wrap multiple axons at
once, intermittently contact others, and fail to segregate larger-
diameter axons. The inability to closely appose and adhere to
axons could be due to an inability to stabilize their cytoskeleton in
response to ErbB2 activation in the absence of cofilin. This pos-
sibility is supported by the distribution of pS3-cofilin in normal
SC/DRGN cocultures (Fig. 10). Bipolar SC processes contained
higher levels of phosphorylated cofilin S3, LIMK, and SSH1 than
multipolar processes of axon-associated SCs. Moreover, inhibi-
tion of LIMK activity reduced pS3-cofilin levels in SCs, and con-
comitantly their ability to align bipolar processes on axons. This
suggests that cofilin S3 phosphorylation plays a role during early
differentiation and is needed to stabilize SC–axon contacts dur-
ing axon engagement. Previously, phosphorylated ErbB2 and the
Cdc42/Rac guanine exchange factor Dock7 were shown to be
present at the leading edge of membrane protrusions in migrat-
ing SCs (Yamauchi et al., 2008). Thus, NRG1 could stimulate
Cdc42/Rac-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of
LIMK, leading to cofilin S3 phosphorylation during the initial
alignment of SC on axons. Alternatively, cofilin could be phos-
phorylated in response to ␤1 integrin activation of Cdc42/Rac/
Pak or Rho/ROCK, both of which phosphorylate LIMK. ROCK
has been shown to play a role in SC myelination (Melendez-
Vasquez et al., 2004).

Previous studies suggested that pS3-cofilin plays an important
role in phospholipid signaling (Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010) by
binding and sequestering PIP2 on the membrane (van Rheenen
et al., 2007). A role for PIP3 in myelination has been demon-
strated previously (Goebbels et al., 2010). A concomitant de-
crease in PIP2 levels observed in PTEN (phosphate and tensin
homolog)-null sciatic nerves could lead to rampant cofilin acti-
vation and contribute to the observed hypermyelination. Addi-
tionally, pS3-cofilin directly stimulates phospholipase D1 in
response to receptor activation (Han et al., 2007). This enzyme is
regulated by Rho GTPases, protein kinase C, and PIP2 (Rudge
and Wakelam, 2009). Phosphatidic acid regulates integrin-
dependent adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling, binds mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) and S6 kinase, and enriches
the Rac guanine exchange factor DOCK2 at the leading edge of

neutrophils (Gomez-Cambronero, 2010). Hence, the phenotype
observed in cofilin-deficient SCs potentially reflects deregulation
of phospholipid signaling as well as actin dynamics.

Cofilin is an end target for both NRG1 and laminin signaling.
Our results support the conclusion that the spatiotemporal balance
of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cofilin S3 regulates SC
function during myelination. During axon engagement, an increase
in cofilin S3 phosphorylation would stabilize F-actin and decrease
process motility, allowing adhesive SC–axon interactions to develop.
During active myelination, dephosphorylation of cofilin S3 triggers
directed expansion of the plasma membrane in response to NRG1. A
working model summarizing our results is presented in Figure 11.
Future studies will test the hypothesis that localized cofilin dephos-
phorylation along the inner mesaxon contributes to its motility dur-
ing active myelination.
