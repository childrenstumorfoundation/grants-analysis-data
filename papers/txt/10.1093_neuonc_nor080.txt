Cancers of the nervous system are clinically challenging
tumors that present with varied histopathologies and
genetic etiologies. While the prognosis for the most
malignant of these tumors is essentially unchanged
despite decades of basic and translational science
research, the past few years have witnessed the identiﬁ-
cation of numerous targetable molecular alterations in
these cancers. With the advent of advanced genomic
sequencing methodologies and the development of
accurate small-animal models of these nervous system
cancers, we are now ideally positioned to develop
personalized therapies that target the unique cellular
and molecular changes that deﬁne their formation and
drive their continued growth. Recently, the National
Cancer Institute convened a workshop to advance our
understanding of nervous system cancer mouse models
and to inform clinical trials by reconsidering these
neoplasms as complex biological systems characterized
by heterogeneity at all levels.

Keywords: brain tumor, genetically engineered mice,
glioma, medulloblastoma, xenograft.

Tumors of the nervous system comprise a hetero-

geneous group of neoplasms that vary in location,
age at onset, histologic features, tendency for pro-
gression and migration, and response to therapy.1 In this
regard, these tumors exhibit a wide spectrum of histo-
logic subtypes reﬂecting their potential cell of origin,
causative molecular changes, local microenvironments,
and clinical behavior (Table 1). Recent studies have
underscored this heterogeneity, even within a histologi-
cally deﬁned tumor subtype, demonstrating that histo-
logically similar
several distinct
molecular subtypes,2 – 4 each with a unique pattern of
deregulated growth control pathways.5 Similarly, other
CNS tumors (e.g., medulloblastoma, ependymoma)
harbor distinct gene expression patterns that suggest
that this molecular heterogeneity may be harnessed to
develop more individualized therapies for these deadly
cancers.6 – 8

Fig. 1. Nervous System Tumor Models. (A) Xenograft models are created from patients’ tumors or from established glioma cell lines injected
into immunocompromised mice. Brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) are isolated from freshly dissociated tumors and sorted based on cell
surface markers. (B) GEM models are designed to produce tumors de novo by activating oncogenic mutations and/or inactivating tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs) in a cell-type speciﬁc manner. (C) A variation of GEM utilizes intracranial
injections of viruses to express
oncogenes in the CNS. The RCAS/Tva system allows for cell-speciﬁc expression of oncogenes.

to evaluate potential treatment modalities. In general,
small-animal models can be divided into two basic cat-
egories: (1) those that implant tumor cells into recipient
mice (xenograft) and (2) those that induce tumors in
mice de novo (genetically engineered mouse [GEM]
models) (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst generation of nervous system
tumor xenograft models employed tumor cell lines that
had been maintained under artiﬁcial cell culture con-
ditions for extended periods of time (often decades).
Typically, the tumors generated from these cell lines
fail to accurately reproduce the classical histopathologic
appearances of their human counterparts,9 display no
molecular resemblance to the original human tumor,3
and, more importantly, are not predictive of drug
response in preclinical trials.10

Over the past several years, a number of laboratories
have developed orthotopic xenograft models using
primary nervous system tumor cells from freshly isolated
human brain tumors. These tumor models recapitulate
certain features of the human tumors, including their inva-
sive behaviors and tissue architecture. More recently, the
isolation of brain tumor-initiating cell populations from
dissociated patient tumors using cell surface markers has
reﬁned our understanding of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) heterogeneity with respect to renewal and tumor-
initiating capacities. Dr David James (University of
California, San Francisco) provided a nice overview of
the human glioma xenografts generated in his laboratory
and outlined their use for preclinical therapeutic studies.
Similarly, Dr Jann Sarkaria (Mayo Clinic) demonstrated

694

NEURO-ONCOLOGY † J U L Y 2 0 1 1

that these human high-grade glioma xenografts retain
most of the seminal genetic alterations observed in the
original patient tumors, which were remarkably stable
over time. While these brain tumor models have the
advantage of deriving from actual human tumors, they
are grown in mice lacking a functional immune system
or a relevant microenvironment.

In contrast, GEM models are designed to induce brain
tumors using relevant cancer-causing genetic changes in
the context of an intact immune system and nervous
system microenvironment. Their use for functionally
validating the role of speciﬁc genetic changes to tumor
formation and progression has been particularly instruc-
tive, and they have revealed important roles for local and
genomic environments in tumorigenesis and continued
tumor growth. In preceding studies in human tumors,
accurate small-animal nervous system GEM strains
have been used to test the efﬁcacy of novel drugs and
compounds in preclinical settings.

Cell of Origin and Developmental

Neurobiology

The session on the interface between neuro-oncology
and developmental neurobiology was moderated by
Dr Charles Stiles (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and
focused on the various methodologies employed to
identify the cell types that give rise to various brain
tumors. A recurrent theme in this session was the
concept of the varying degrees of permissiveness of
stem and progenitor cells to speciﬁc cancer-causing
genetic alterations. In this regard, tumorigenesis in the
nervous system is dependent on a combination of speciﬁc
cancer-associated genetic mutations occurring in recep-
tive cell types during permissive periods of nervous
system development.

Dr Rob Wechsler-Reya (Sanford-Burnham Medical
Research Institute) presented data from mouse medullo-
blastoma modeling experiments suggesting that more per-
sonalized brain tumor treatments may come from a more
complete understanding of the interplay between genetic
mutations and the speciﬁc stem and progenitor cells in
which these mutations occur.
In these studies, he
employed a combination of human xenograft and GEM
models to re-create various genetic subtypes of medullo-
blastoma. He showed that forced expression of c-myc in
cerebellar stem cells is mitogenic and results in transient
hyperplasia, while simultaneous expression of c-myc
and mutant p53 results in aggressive tumors that resemble
human large-cell anaplastic medulloblastoma. Further
characterization of these tumors indicated that they
were molecularly distinct from those driven by Ptch
mutation and exhibited different responses to therapy.

Dr Silvia Marino (Barts and The London School of
Medicine and Dentistry) demonstrated that loss of p53
and Rb in two different populations of progenitor
cells—cerebellar granule cell progenitors and cerebellar
stem cells of ventricular zone (VZ) origin—gave rise to
medulloblastomas in mouse models. In these studies, con-
ditional inactivation of Rb and p53 was obtained in these

Gutmann et al.: 5th MMHCC nervous system tumor group

cells either in vivo, through granule cell progenitors, or in
vitro followed by orthotopical transplantation, through
VZ-derived stem cells of nongranule cell lineage. Both
populations gave rise to medulloblastoma tumors with
identical histopathologic appearances; however, tumors
originating from VZ progenitors preferentially expressed
stem cell markers. This set of markers was shown to
identify a subset of human medulloblastomas associated
with a poorer clinical outcome.

Dr William Weiss

(University

of California,
San Francisco) presented studies that focused on identify-
ing the cell of origin in two glioma models. First, using
advanced labeling techniques, he demonstrated that in
an astrocytoma GEM model (GFAP-HaRas) developed
by Dr Abhijit Guha,11 gliomas arise from SVZ-derived
stem cells, whereas in the S100-vErb oligodendroglioma
model,12 tumors originated from white matter NG2+
glial progenitor cells. He further demonstrated that
NG2+, but not CD133+, cells isolated from human oli-
godendroglioma tumors were capable of forming tumors
following implantation into immunocompromised mice.

Dr Charles Eberhart

(Johns Hopkins University)
described the differences between various Notch iso-
forms in inducing glioma formation in the optic nerve
and retina. In his studies, he showed that while Notch3
robustly induced optic nerve gliomas, tumors were not
generated following expression of activated Notch1 or
Notch2. These experiments clearly demonstrate differ-
ences in the susceptibility of tissues for oncogenic trans-
formation by the Notch gene family. Using chimeric
Notch constructs, the oncogenic portion of the Notch3
gene was found to reside in the carboxyl terminal
domain of the protein.

Dr Marco Giovannini (House Ear Institute) described
a new mouse model of schwannomatosis. In human
schwannomatosis, NF2 mutations
common;
however, mutations in the INI1 gene are observed in
30% of familial and 7% of sporadic cases. Whereas tar-
geted deletion of Ini1 in mice is lethal, Schwann cell pre-
cursors with conditional Ini1 inactivation resulted in
olfactory nerve, third cranial nerve, and trigeminal
nerve tumors. Current studies are focused on developing
mice with combined Ini1 and Nf2 inactivation in
Schwann cell precursors.

Stromal Inﬂuences on Tumorigenesis

As has been reported for other cancers,13 – 15 it is becom-
ing increasingly clear that the local microenvironment
plays a critical role in brain tumor development and
growth. This session was moderated by Dr Frank
Furnari (Ludwig Institute, University of California, San
Diego) and focused on the use of GEM strains to eluci-
date the complex relationship between neoplastic and
nonneoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment.

In particular, two presentations employed the inher-
ited cancer predisposition syndrome, neuroﬁbromatosis

type 1 (NF1), to demonstrate that speciﬁc cell types and
signals from the tumor microenvironment are important
for gliomagenesis and continued glioma growth. The use
of NF1 as a model system to study nervous system
tumor-stroma interactions derives from studies ﬁrst pub-
lished by Dr Luis Parada (Southwestern University), in
which targeted loss of Nf1 in Schwann cell precursors
is insufﬁcient for tumorigenesis unless coupled with het-
erozygosity for an inactivating Nf1 gene mutation in
nonneoplastic cells.16 These initial observations have
been extended to glioma17,18 and used to identify
speciﬁc growth factors and cytokines that drive tumori-
genesis and continued glioma growth.19 – 21

Dr David Gutmann (Washington University School
of Medicine) described the critical role that microglia
play in Nf1 GEM optic glioma growth. Using a combi-
nation of approaches, he demonstrated that pharmaco-
logic and genetic microglia silencing inhibits optic
glioma growth. Moreover, he described studies in
which optic nerve microglia are uniquely sensitive to
the effects of Nf1 heterozygosity during early glioma for-
mation, leading to studies aimed at disrupting the inter-
actions between microglia and preneoplastic/neoplastic
cells during critical phases of gliomagenesis.

Dr Joshua Rubin (Washington University School of
Medicine) next reported on his discovery of one key
chemokine
expressed in the nonneoplastic optic
glioma microenvironment. He showed that CXCL12
(stroma-derived factor-1a) normally induces astrocyte
in Nf1-/- astrocytes, CXCL12
apoptosis, whereas
treatment leads to inappropriate astrocyte survival in
vitro. This reduced apoptosis reﬂects decreased intra-

duction,

Genomics and Systems Biology

With the recent explosion of comprehensive genomic

Laboratories), presentations focused on the various

Dr Suzanne Baker (St Jude Children’s Research
Hospital) presented data demonstrating the profound
differences of Pten gene inactivation on gliomagenesis.
Whereas postnatal, adult Pten ablation in astrocytes
had no effect, combined deletion with other tumor

suppressors induced astrocytomas with high penetrance.
Co-deletion of Pten and Rb failed to induce astrocyto-
mas, but co-deletion of Pten and p53, p53 and Rb, or
Pten, p53,
induced astrocytomas.
Secondary mutations within the phosphoinositide-3
kinase and retinoblastoma signaling pathways were
found in tumors that were induced by inactivation of
tumor suppressors in the same pathways. Tumors
formed within and outside of proliferative niches in
adult brain.

Dr David Largaespada (University of Minnesota)
described work on the use of the sleeping beauty (SB)
transposon system for mutagenesis screens in mice con-
ditionally deleted for Pten and p53. Using this approach,
he was able to generate cerebellar tumors with different
complements of genetic alterations. For example, one of
the genes inactivated by SB in this genetic screen was
Slit3, which his laboratory demonstrated was also inac-
tivated by mutation or promoter methylation in human
medulloblastoma.

Dr Karlyne Reilly (NCI Frederick) presented her
work on the identiﬁcation of genetic modiﬁers of
Nf1:p53-Cis – driven malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor (MPNST). In these studies, she leveraged the
differential susceptibility to MPNST in A/J compared
with C57Bl/6J mice. One candidate gene was found to
be an imprinted gene. Using a targeting strategy, she
discovered that this modiﬁer gene acts in a tumor sup-
pressive manner when inherited from the mother.
These ﬁndings support a model in which the severity
of MPNSTs depends on whether maternal or paternal

Therapeutic Targets

In the ﬁnal session of the meeting, approaches to disco-
vering and exploiting therapeutic targets were discussed.
This session was moderated by Dr Gideon Bollag
(Plexxikon) and emphasized the complexities associated
with performing preclinical trials in mice and the adap-
tability of tumors to therapeutic interventions.

Dr Al Charest (Tufts University School of Medicine)
presented work using a GBM model driven by wild-type
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Drawing
upon the observation that human GBMs overexpressing
wild-type EGFR also express EGFR ligands, he
described a model by which somatic expression of
EGFR and of transforming growth factor-a (an EGFR
ligand) in the context of loss of cdkn2a and/or Pten
tumor suppressor gene function yields tumors with mol-
ecular and histopathologic features of “classical” GBM
tumors. He also described differences in the sensitivity
of cdkn2a-null and cdkn2a;Pten-null tumor cells to
EGFR inhibitors. His laboratory found that this differ-
ence arises from tumor cells switching their dependence
for mitogenic signaling from one receptor tyrosine
kinase to another. These data illustrate one molecular
mechanism for the primary resistance of GBMs to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition.

Fig. 2. Nervous System Tumor Heterogeneity. (A) Tumors arise in different parts of the CNS with unique histopathologic presentations. (B)
Within a tumor, there are multiple cell types that interact. (C) Within the tumor cells, there are multiple signaling pathways that integrate and
create a physiological output. (D) Tumors categorized histologically as one entity differ considerably in their genomic makeup.

Dr Michael Berens (The Translational Genomics
Research Institute) described the Ivy Genomics-based
Medicine Project, which is a 9-institute preclinical
study relating chemovulnerability to molecular proﬁling
in human primary GBM orthotopic xenografts. Funded
by the Ben and Catherine Ivy Foundation, the update
reported survival outcomes of 21 GBM models tested
with 4 treatment regimens; genomic data (expression
proﬁling, array comparative genomic hybridization,
cytosine-phosphate-guanine methylation, and selected
DNA sequencing of the models) are being produced.
Engagement of pharmaceutical companies to provide a
larger spectrum of targeted therapeutic agents remains
in motion. Using extensive genomic proﬁling of 40
GBM xenograft lines, one initial objective was to estab-
lish a proband set of xenograft tumors with genomic

signatures that represent the spectrum of patients with
GBM as portrayed in The Cancer Genome Atlas. A
follow-up study proposes to use the molecular proﬁling
data to inform treatment planning (clinical trial) by
matching the therapeutic responses of the various xeno-
graft lines to their genetic signatures and aligning these
against patient tumor signatures.

Dr Eric Holland (Memorial Sloan Kettering)
described a procedure to generate a recurrent model of
GBM using the replication-competent ALV splice accep-
tor (RCAS) virus/Tva model system. Tumor-bearing
animals were given fractionated ionizing radiation or
temozolomide therapy. Gene expression proﬁling was
performed before and after
to identify
genetic signatures most predictive of recurrence-free sur-
vival. In parallel, Dr Holland also presented data on the

treatment

relative sensitivity of the various cell types within the
GBM tumor to therapeutic intervention in vivo. Using
differential cell puriﬁcation methods, he was able to
identify speciﬁc genes within the Olig2+ population of
cells that might mediate resistance to radiation.

Dr John Ohlfest (University of Minnesota) described
the importance of the multidrug resistance system in the
treatment of brain cancer. There are two dominant
mechanisms responsible for poor blood-brain barrier
(BBB) penetration of certain molecularly targeted
drugs: the efﬂux systems coded for by the Bcrp and
Pgp genes. Ohlfest advocated that although the BBB in
the tumor core is leaky, allowing for systemic drug deliv-
ery, the tumor-inﬁltrated normal brain (the site of recur-
rence) has an intact BBB, which prevents drug delivery.
Using a combination of knockout mice and speciﬁc
pharmacologic inhibitors, he demonstrated that BCRP
and PGP cooperate by synergistically efﬂuxing geﬁtinib,
sorafenib, and dasatinib from the brain. However, in the
case of sorafenib, Bcrp was dominant, while for geﬁtinib
and dasatinib, PgP was dominant. Using a mouse glioma
model based on SB-delivered oncogenes, he discovered
that loss of function of both the Bcrp and Pgp genes
more than doubled survival after treatment with dasati-
nib relative to wild-type mice. In addition, western blot
data revealed that dasatinib markedly inhibited phos-
phorylation of Src only in the Bcrp Pgp compound
knockout mice. Collectively, these results suggest that
optimal penetration of these drugs into tumor-inﬁltrated
normal brain where the BBB is intact is dependent on
Bcrp and PgP function, such that administration of
single inhibitors of PgP or Bcrp would have minimal
clinical advantage over chemotherapeutic agent alone.
More importantly, these data stress the need to consider
penetration of molecularly targeted agents in the tumor-
inﬁltrated normal brain where the BBB is intact.

Summary—Leveraging Heterogeneity

One of the common themes of this meeting was hetero-
geneity. Heterogeneity affects nervous system tumor
formation and treatment in many ways (Fig. 2). First,
tumor susceptibility is inﬂuenced by genomic heterogen-
eity, such that both tumor formation and response to
therapy are dictated in part by modiﬁer genes in our indi-
vidual genomes. Subtle polymorphisms in speciﬁc genes
may change the local microenvironment, expression of
speciﬁc tumor suppressor genes, or drug metabolizing
enzymes.22 – 27 Second, progenitor cells and stem cells

in distinct regions of the brain and during different
times of development are unique, and may be differen-
tially affected by cancer-causing genetic changes. For
example, Nf1 inactivation in astrocytes or neural stem
cells from the cortex has little effect on astrocyte pro-
liferation or astrogliogenesis in vitro and in vivo,
whereas Nf1 loss in brainstem neural stem cells or astro-
cytes results in increased proliferation and gliomagen-
esis.28 Third,
the local microenvironment harbors
specialized cells and signals capable of initiating and
maintaining tumors in the nervous system. Fourth, the
signaling pathways and transcriptional factor networks
are highly adaptable and dynamic.
In considering
future therapies for brain tumors, we will need to
employ a systems-based approach that integrates this
heterogeneity at all levels to effect a more personalized
treatment for these deadly cancers.

This workshop also provided a glimpse into future
directions for glioma model research. Several labora-
tories are focusing on expanding the complexities of
their models to better mimic human tumors for preclini-
cal studies. As such, a great deal of resources and efforts
are invested in studying therapeutic responses in models
that are genetically designed to mirror patients’ tumors.
In addition, more sophisticated studies on basic mechan-
isms of gliomagenesis are arising. Speciﬁcally,
the
concept of permissibility and resistance of glia and
neuro stem vs non stem cell to oncogenic assault will
no doubt reveal basic themes for CNS cancers. In the
coming years, we will witness an unprecedented level
of sophistication in these models and their use that will
translate into major advances for both clinical and
basic research.
