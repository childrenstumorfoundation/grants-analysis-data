Vestibular schwannomas are histopathologically benign tumors arising from the Schwann cell sheath surround-
ing the vestibular branch of cranial nerve VIII and are related to the NF2 gene and its product merlin. Merlin acts as 
a tumor suppressor and as a mediator of contact inhibition. Thus, deficiencies in both NF2 genes lead to vestibular 
schwannoma development. Recently, there have been major advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of 
vestibular schwannomas as well as the development of novel therapies for its treatment. In this article the authors 
comprehensively review the recent advances in the molecular biology and characterization of vestibular schwanno-
mas as well as the development of modern treatments for vestibular schwannoma. For instance, merlin is involved 
with a number of receptors including the CD44 receptor, EGFR, and signaling pathways, such as the Ras/raf pathway 
and the canonical Wnt pathway. Recently, merlin was also shown to interact in the nucleus with E3 ubiquitin ligase 
CRL4DCAF1. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind vestibular schwannoma tumorigenesis has 
begun to yield novel therapies. Some authors have shown that Avastin induces regression of progressive schwan-
nomas by over 40% and improves hearing. An inhibitor of VEGF synthesis, PTC299, is currently in Phase II trials 
as a potential agent to treat vestibular schwannoma. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that trastuzumab (an 
ERBB2 inhibitor) reduces vestibular schwannoma cell proliferation. With further research it may be possible to sig-
nificantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates by decreasing tumor burden, tumor volume, hearing loss, and cranial 
nerve deficits seen in vestibular schwannomas. (DOI: 10.3171/2011.6.JNS11131)

V estibular  schwannomas,  also  known  as  acous-

tic  neuromas,  are  histopathologically  benign  tu-
mors that most commonly grow slowly from the 
Schwann cell sheath surrounding the vestibular branch of 
cranial nerve VIII.62 They often extend into the cerebello-
pontine angle and can affect the sensory nerves of cranial 
nerve V, the lower cranial nerves, and the motor nerves of 
cranial nerve VII.25,36,62 In the US, the incidence rate for 
all  primary  CNS  nerve  sheath  tumors  is  approximately 
1.1/100,000 person-years.18,19,88 Studies in Denmark have 
shown  an  increase  of  sporadic  vestibular  schwannoma 
over the years: 7.8 per million per year between 1976 and 
1983, 9.8 per million per year between 1983 and 1990, 
12.4 per million per year between 1990 and 1995, 17.4 
per  million  per  year  between  1996  and  2001,  and  19.3

per million in 2001.102,103,108–111 However, the authors not-
ed that this may be due to increased diagnosis resulting 
from increased use of MR imaging.103
Neurofibromatosis Type 1, or von Recklinghausen dis-
ease, was coined in 1882 by Fredrich von Recklinghausen, 
who noted 5 patients with congenital neurofibromas.118 In 
1822, Wishart122 reported on bilateral acoustic neuromas 
with faster progression of cerebral and spinal lesions.119 
Vestibular  schwannomas  are  also  intricately  related  to 
NF2 where the NF2 gene, located on chromosome 22, is 
altered. It has also been shown that in patients with uni-
lateral vestibular schwannoma, there is an increased risk 
of tumor growth with greater tumor size at initial presen-
tation.2,9,32,100,104  Furthermore,  the  presence  of  tinnitus  at 
presentation increases the odds of tumor growth 3-fold.2

Novel molecular therapy for vestibular schwannomas

Recently,  there  have  been  major  advances  in  our 
knowledge of the molecular biology of vestibular schwan-
noma  as  well  as  the  development  of  modern  and  novel 
therapies for treating this disease. In this article, we com-
prehensively review the recent advances in the molecular 
biology and characterization of vestibular schwannomas 
and the development of modern treatments for vestibular 
schwannoma.

Etiology

In the general population, sporadic cases of vestibular 
schwannomas tend to arise unilaterally (95%), whereas in 
patients with NF2 they commonly occur bilaterally.81 The 
most  common  symptoms  associated  with  sporadic  ves-
tibular schwannoma include vertigo, hearing loss, facial 
paralysis,  tinnitus,  trigeminal  neuralgia,  and  occasion-
ally  more  serious  complications  such  as  hydrocepha-
lus,  malignant  transformation,  and  brainstem  compres-
sion.8,20,24,54,75,81,99,121 Sporadic vestibular schwannomas are 
benign, slow-growing tumors in patients who present at 
a  median  age  of  approximately  50  years.81  Conversely, 
NF2-associated  bilateral  vestibular  schwannoma  tu-
mors  generally  have  faster  growth  rates  and  a  younger 
age  of  presentation.43,94  The  incidence  of  NF2  is  about 
1  in  35,000  persons,  with  no  greater  risk  found  in  any 
one  ethnicity.25,64  Patients  with  the  NF2  exhibit  similar 
symptoms as those with the sporadic form of vestibular 
schwannoma  but  with  the  added  genetic  predisposition 
for  ocular  manifestations  such  as  posterior  subcapsular 
lens opacities.62
Neurofibromatosis  Type  2  represents  an  autosomal 
dominant  disorder  with  full  penetrance  associated  with 
the NF2 gene located on chromosome 22 band q11–13.1, 
which  normally  encodes  the  protein  merlin  (schwanno-
min).64,124 Merlin is thought to play a role in the mainte-
nance of membrane stability by interacting with cytoskel-
etal and integral membrane proteins.64 It has been shown 
that both sporadic and NF2-related vestibular schwanno-
mas  are  associated  with  a  loss  of  function  of  merlin  in 
Schwann  cells.3,91  Therefore,  since  its  discovery,  merlin 
produced by the NF2 gene has been thought of as a clas-
sic tumor suppressor.64 In a study of 33 patients with the 
NF2 mutation, 19 of 20 alterations in the NF2 gene were 
interrupted due a stop codon, frame shift, or interference 
with splicing causing truncation of merlin.64

Histopathological and Radiological Findings
Vestibular  schwannomas  in  patients  with  the  NF2 
gene are histologically benign.64 It has been shown that 
a loss of function mutation in the NF2 gene causes the 
Schwann  cell  function  to  switch  from  myelinating  to 
nonmyelinating.43 Histologically, both sporadic and NF2 
tumors  are  composed  of  intersecting  elongated  spindle 
cells  with  long  cigarlike  nuclei.43,61  Sporadic  and  NF2-
associated  schwannomas  are  similar  barring  a  few  dif-
ferences.62  Forty  percent  of  NF2-associated  vestibular 
schwannomas exhibit a nodular pattern, whereas sporadic 
schwannomas rarely appear this way. Furthermore, nerve 
fibers  are  often  rooted  into  NF2-associated  vestibular 

J Neurosurg / Volume 115 / November 2011

schwannomas,  whereas  they  are  more  extracapsular  in 
the sporadic form.44,62 Another predominant histological 
feature  is  islands  of  neoplastic  schwannoma  cells  bor-
dered  by  a  broad  central  area  of  eosinophilic  fibrosis 
with large regions of tumor cells in the margins.126 In a 
retrospective review of the histology of tumors after ra-
diotherapy, it was found that the irradiated tumors were 
somewhat cellular with nuclear polymorphism, vascular 
hyalinization,  and  hemosiderin  deposition.56  However, 
the authors noted that these changes were also normal in 
nonirradiated vestibular schwannomas and observed that 
the absence of necrosis postirradiation indicates possible 
radioresistance.56 It is thought that radioresistance occurs 
when there is only a small fraction of cells dividing in the 
tumor on administration of low-dose radiation.60,126 The 
molecular  mechanism  behind  radioresistance  has  been 
postulated to be related to the inhibition of ERBB2 and 
interference with cell-cycle arrest.37,126

Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is the gold stan-
dard for imaging investigation.119 Other examinations in-
clude CT scanning and digital subtraction angiography.68 
On MR imaging, the cerebellopontine angle, auditory ca-
nal, and brainstem are often visualized to measure tumor 
size, mass effect, and potential scarring and fibrosis to 
cranial  nerves  such  as  the  facial  nerve.56  Computed  to-
mography scanning is beneficial for both diagnostic and 
surgical  management.  On  thin-cut  CT  scans,  expansion 
of the internal auditory canal is often noted. The tumor 
may  also  have  thinned  the  bone  surrounding  it  without 
any hyperostosis that may be seen with meningiomas in 
similar  locations.  Formal  angiography  can  sometimes 
demonstrate  feeding  vessels  to  these  schwannomas.1,125 
Additionally, the location of the surrounding major ves-
sels can be elucidated.

Molecular Biology and Pathology

The NF2 Gene and the Structure of Merlin

The  NF2 gene was first identified on chromosome 
22 using polymorphic DNA markers to screen for loss of 
chromosomal regions.96 Studies were prompted based on 
previous studies of meningiomas that also presented with 
bilateral vestibular schwannomas. It has been postulated 
that the NF2 gene acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and 
generally  one  allele  is  inherited  in  an  autosomal  domi-
nant fashion.64,96 A “second hit” is necessary to knock out 
the remaining normal allele to cause disease; this is often 
caused by a second-point mutation or loss of heterozygos-
ity.35,76 However, in one study, it was shown that 49% of 
cases were due to two sporadic mutations affecting each 
allele with a rate of 6.5 × 10−6.25,76 Individuals with NF2 
also have a greater risk of developing peripheral schwan-
nomas,  meningiomas,  and  spinal  ependymomas,  which 
al so exhibit biallelic NF2 inactivation.40,74,92,114

In  1993,  two  other  groups  isolated  the  loss  of  mu-
tation to 22q12.2 using genetic linkage analysis and tu-
mor deletion mapping.91,112 The product of this gene was 
found to be a 595 amino acid “moesin-ezrin-radixin-like 
protein”  known  as  “merlin”  or  “schwannomin,”  which 
is  similar  to  cytoskeleton-associated  proteins  known  as 
ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM).14,64,91 Both merlin and ERM 

907

contain  a  FERM  (Four-point  one,  ezrin,  radixin,  moe-
sin)–binding domain usually on the amino terminus that 
allows  it  to  mediate  cell-cell  attachment,  cell  motility, 
membrane  receptor  availability,  and  signal  transduction 
(Fig. 1).14,71,98 ERM family proteins can interact with one 
another  using  ERM-associated  domains  (N-ERMAD, 
C-ERMAD).  While  merlin  lacks  C-ERMAD,  it  still 
can bind to actin.14,21,45,53,55,71,85,93,105 Moreover, it has been 
shown that merlin can affect signal transduction of Rho 
family GTPases such as Rac1 by associating with PAK 
(p21-activated kinase).22,42,50,65,71,97,101,106

A  recent  in  vitro  study  on  small  interfering  RNA 
merlin knockdowns in human Schwann cells showed that 
there was an accumulation of EGFRB (ERBB2, ERBB3), 
CD44, and nestin.3

Merlin Regulation

Studies in Drosophila indicate that merlin can exist 
in a folded or nonfolded state and that the unfolded state is 
active in vivo.52 In the unfolded state, merlin’s C-ERMAD 
can mediate cell-cell adhesion by binding to actin fila-
ments, but the folded state is thought to be the tumor sup-
pressor form.71 It has been shown that missense mutations 
disrupt  the  folded  state  and  its  tumor  suppressive  func-
tion.83 Merlin’s conformational changes are promoted by 
PAK, which phosphorylates merlin at S518, interrupting 
the c-terminal domain and maintaining the folded state 
(Fig. 2).49,82 This folding is accomplished by a folding of 
the alpha-helical portion and c-terminal portion of merlin 
such that it blocks the FERM binding sites.57,71,84 Merlin’s 
ability to act as a tumor suppressor is likely related to its 
ability to inhibit the Rac pathway, which has been associ-
ated with tumorigenesis (Fig. 2).49,82,90 Understanding of 
this pathway may lead to the development of PAK inhibi-
tors that would prevent PAK from phosphorylating mer-
lin, allowing for maintenance of merlin’s inhibition of the 
Rac1 pathway.49

Merlin Cell-Cell Adhesion and Contact Inhibition

In mouse studies, it has been shown that there is low 
merlin  expression  prior  to  tissue  fusion,  indicating  that 
merlin  would  normally  suppress  cell-cell  adhesion.72  In 
studies of NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 

B. Fong et al.

it has been shown that fibroblasts lose contact inhibition 
of  cell  proliferation  and  that  Rac1  (−/−)  mutants  were 
able  to  inhibit  uncontrolled  cell  proliferation.12,22,50,71,97 
This  finding  indicates  that  merlin  negatively  regulates 
Rac1-mediated  canonical  Wnt  signaling  and  that  Rac1 
is necessary for loss of contact inhibition.12,22,50,71,97 It has 
also been shown that merlin interacts with CD44, a cell-
surface receptor for hyaluronan (HA), and plays a role in 
promoting  contact-dependent  inhibition  of  proliferation 
and suppressing tumor growth.78 Furthermore, increased 
merlin  expression  in  Schwann  cells  prevents  HA  from 
binding to the CD44 receptor, preventing tumor growth 
in  immunocompromised  mice.7  Bai  et  al.7  showed  that 
the first 50 amino acids of the C-terminal end of merlin 
are responsible for its inhibitory effect on the CD44-HA 
interaction.  Morrison  and  coworkers78  also  showed  that 
under normal circumstances at high cell density, merlin 
becomes hypophosphorylated, inhibiting cell growth, but 
at low cell density, merlin is phosphorylated, allowing for 
growth.  PAK  promotes  release  from  contact  inhibition 
through phosphorylation of merlin, causing it to remain 
in its folded state.82 Merlin localizes to the cell membrane 
and stabilizes cadherin-dependent cell-cell junctions that 
inhibit  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  activation.4,31,89,107  This 
also  explains  why  merlin  would  normally  inhibit  Rac1 
activation by interfering with the RTK pathway.4,47,79

Merlin Proliferative Activity

Hansen  and  colleagues38  showed  that  vestibular 
schwan nomas  express  Neuroregulin-1  (NRG1)  and  its 
re ceptors  ERBB2  (also  known  as  Her2/neu  or  HER2) 
and ERBB3 in vivo. NRG1 induces proliferation of hu-
man Schwann cells by binding ERBB2 and ERBB3 and 
initiating  a  phosphorylation  cascade  resulting  in  activa-
tion  of  PI3k  and  MAPK  pathways.6,67  Furthermore,  it 
has been shown that NRG1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 are ex-
pressed  during  wallerian  degeneration,  a  state  in  which 
there is a loss of axonal contact.15 This indicates a poten-
tial  relationship  with  merlin,  which  normally  functions 
to inhibit cell growth by inhibition of cell-cell adhesion. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that Merlin normally in-
hibits ERBB2 activation and ERBB2-Src binding.40 This 
offers  an  explanation  for  how  loss  of  merlin  would  al-
low  for  Src  activation  and  downstream  phosphorylation 

Fig. 1. Schematic of merlin domains. Merlin consists of a FERM component at the N-terminal domain, which is subdivided into 
subdomains A, B, and C, and a C-terminal end. The N-terminal domain is postulated to be responsible for merlin’s role in cell-
cell adhesion and signal transduction. Reproduced with permission from Shimizu et al.: J Biol Chem 277:10332–10336, 2002.

of CRL4DCAF1 downregulates genes promoting cell-cycle 
progression  and  upregulates  genes  related  to  apoptosis 
and  cell-cycle  arrest.41,58,70  Expression  of  merlin  and  in-
activation of CRL4DCAF1 also inhibits integrin, PDGF sig-
naling, and downregulated cell adhesion genes.58 Perhaps 
most importantly, Li et al. also demonstrated that deple-
tion of DCAF1 reverses the effect of merlin inactivation 
and suppresses growth of merlin-deficient tumors both in 
vitro and in vivo. Depletion of DCAF1 inhibits hyperpro-
liferation of Schwann cells in NF2 patients, suppressing 
tumorigenesis in merlin-deficient cell lines.58 Therefore, 
DCAF1 inhibitors may be explored as a potential treat-
ment option for patients with NF2-associated vestibular 
schwannoma.

NF2 Mosaicism/Segmental NF2

Using DNA hybridization studies, one group of au-
thors found that vestibular schwannomas show heteroge-
neity, perhaps due to mosaicism in which some cells are 
normal  and  others  carry  only  one  normal  chromosome 
22.96 Mosaicism occurs in sporadic NF2 if de novo muta-
tions occur after fertilization and cell division.10,51

Expression of VEGF 

Vascular endothelial growth factor, a diffusible gly-
coprotein, plays a major role in the angiogenesis of brain 
tumors.28 It binds to either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2, both 
of  which  are  located  on  vascular  endothelial  cells.28 
Using  quantitative  real-time  polymerase  chain  reaction 
and quantitative ELISA, it has been found that vestibu-
lar  schwannomas  express  VEGFR-1  at  high  levels.17,115 
Patients  with  a  larger  tumor  volume,  recurrent  tumors, 
and tumors with a high growth rate had higher levels of 
VEGFR-1 and NF2 mRNA.17,115

Sporadic Vestibular Schwannoma

Both sporadic and NF2 vestibular schwannomas are 
associated with a loss of function mutation in the 22q12 
locus.91,112  Whereas  most  of  the  genetic  analysis  of  ves-
tibular schwannoma is focused on patients with NF2, the 
genetics of sporadic vestibular schwannoma is less estab-
lished. Using microarrays, one group found that 8 of the 
upregulated genes are involved in cell-cycle regulation, 6 
in cell morphogenesis, 8 in cell development, 11 in cell 
differentiation, 6 in cell death, 13 in cell adhesion, 9 in 
extracellular matrix, and 50 in protein binding.16

Treatment

Novel Treatment Options

Outside  of  neurosurgical  management  of  vestibular 
schwannomas,  targeted  therapy  has  been  on  the  rise  as 
possible treatment options for patients with NF2. We dis-
cuss current research on several novel treatment options 
for vestibular schwannoma.

Bevacizumab/Avastin

ized  monoclonal  IgG1  antibody  against  VEGF  has  re-

Fig. 2.  Theoretical merlin signaling pathway. Merlin stabilizes cad-
herin interactions at the cell membrane and is inhibited from phosphory-
lation by cadherin binding (contact-inhibition). Accumulation of dephos-
phorylated merlin has an inhibitory function on the Rac pathway, further 
inhibiting mitogenic signaling. Once merlin is no longer bound to cad-
herin, PAK can phosphorylate merlin and remove the inhibition on the 
Rac pathway, which allows for mitogenic signaling. Reproduced with

of FAK and paxillin, ultimately increasing astrocyte cell 
growth.40  Merlin  can  also  bind  to  paxillin  directly  via 
PBD1 (exon 2).27 Loss of exon 2 has been seen in patients 
with  both  NF2  and  sporadic  schwannomas.11,13,27,33,95,120 
The association between merlin and paxillin was found 
to be higher in confluent cells, indicating merlin’s role 
in contact inhibition.27,78 Paxillin plays a role in a variety 
of pathways including that as a mediator for RAC1 bind-
ing.113 It has also been shown that paxillin phosphoryla-
tion is stimulated by neuregulin binding of ERBB2 and 
ERBB3.26,27,66,80,116,117

Merlin also senses cell contact by binding E-cadherin 
and EGFR at the cell membrane, blocking internalization 
of ligand-bound EGFR by sequestering it within an in-
soluble  endosome.22,71  Similarly,  it  has  been  shown  that 
merlin binds b1-integrin and ERBB2 at the plasma mem-
brane.27 This may point to an EGFR or ERBB2 inhibitor 
as targeted therapy for treating vestibular schwannomas 
with the NF2 mutation.

Merlin Tumor Suppressor Function

Since its discovery in 1993, merlin’s function has re-
mained elusive, with only a broad association with tumor 
suppressor function.71 Merlin’s role as a tumor suppressor 
is likely due to its ability to suppress Rac1 recruitment, 
preventing  loss  of  contact  inhibition.82  Furthermore,  it 
has  recently  been  shown  that  the  folded  form  of  mer-
lin translocates to the nucleus and binds to DCAF1 and 
suppresses  cell  proliferation  by  inhibiting  E3  ubiquitin 
ligase  CRL4DCAF1.58  Li  et  al.58  also  showed  that  merlin/
DCAF1  binding  creates  stability,  indicating  that  merlin 
is not a target for degradation but actually an inhibitor of 
CRL4DCAF1. They found that deletion of the merlin-bind-
ing segment for DCAF1 led to constitutive activation of 
the CRL4DCAF1, further indicating that merlin plays a role 
in  the  suppression  of  E3  ubiquitin  ligase.58  CRL4DCAF1 
plays a role in DNA replication and movement through 
the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and merlin’s inactivation

cently been approved for use in the treatment of various 
cancers, such as glioblastoma, that express high levels of 
VEGF.63,123  In  a  case  report  of  2  patients,  bevacizumab 
was infused every 2 weeks at 5.0 mg/kg body weight for 
90 minutes and gradually reduced to 30 minutes.69 The 
authors  of  the  case  report  found  that  bevacizumab  in-
duced regression of progressive vestibular schwannomas 
by  over  40%  and  improved  hearing  in  one  patient  who 
was treated for 6 months. In the first patient with NF2, a 
22-year-old man, MR imaging showed clear improvement 
of brainstem compression with decreased syrinx volume 
as well as improved hearing. The only initial side effects 
were mild epistaxis and fatigue. In the second patient, a 
38-year-old  man,  MR  imaging  demonstrated  resolution 
of the right vestibular schwannoma, but hearing improve-
ment was absent. In this case, the patient was placed on an 
angiotensin I antagonist due to hypertension, a side effect 
of bevacizumab.5,69

Another study of 10 patients with NF2 and progres-
sive  vestibular  schwannomas  who  were  not  candidates 
for traditional treatment received bevacizumab. Nine of 
the  10  patients  exhibited  a  reduction  in  tumor  size  and 
modest improvement in hearing.87 Despite the promise of 
bevacizumab as a treatment option for vestibular schwan-
noma, there are currently only a few case studies that can 
show its effectiveness. Furthermore, angiogenesis is only 
one aspect of tumor proliferation. Therefore, we should 
continue  looking  for  other  therapeutic  options  and  pro-
ceed with caution until bevacizumab can be thoroughly 
examined in larger studies.

Another drug that inhibits VEGF synthesis upstream 
by  interrupting  posttranslational  processing,  PTC299  is 
currently in Phase II trials.48 As with bevacizumab, the 
goal of the drug is to reduce both tumor volume and perfu-
sion at the tumor site. The trial is currently enrolling NF2 
patients with progressive growth of vestibular schwanno-
mas and concurrent hearing loss, and restoration of hear-
ing is being used to measure clinical outcome.48

Trastuzumab

Another potential molecular target is the ERBB2 re-
ceptor, which is associated with the proliferative effects 
of NRG1. In vitro studies have shown that trastuzumab, 
an ERBB2 inhibitor, reduced vestibular schwannoma cell 
proliferation.15 To date, there have been no clinical trials 
on  the  effectiveness  of  trastuzumab  compared  with  the 
standard  treatment.  However,  a  recent  study  has  shown 
that trastuzumab and another ERBB inhibitor, erlotinib, 
inhibit  growth  of  vestibular  schwannoma  xenografts  in 
nude mice.20

Erlotinib

Erlotinib is an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
that is currently available for the treatment of non–small 
cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.46,77,86 Interestingly, 
in  one  study,  treatment  with  erlotinib  resulted  in  in-
creased  vestibular  schwannoma  cell  death  as  measured 
by TUNEL staining.20 Unfortunately, this study did not 
assess for merlin mutations in the tumor xenografts. In a 
retrospective study of 11 patients with NF2 and progres-

B. Fong et al.

sive vestibular schwannoma, the authors found that erlo-
tinib was not associated with decreased tumor size, based 
on  volumetric  MR  imaging  analysis,  and  that  erlotinib 
failed to improve hearing response, based on changes in 
word  recognition  score.86  However,  the  authors  pointed 
out  that  there  were  no  selection  criteria  in  place,  and 
therefore, Phase II clinical trials would still be warrant-
ed. Moreover, they hypothesized that there may be other 
molecular alterations that lead to vestibular schwannoma 
proliferation outside of EGFR receptors.86 The benefits of 
these treatment options are that they can affect multiple 
tumors more easily than open surgery. Furthermore, there 
would  be  fewer  toxic  side  effects  than  with  cytotoxic 
agents, making such treatment options more suitable for 
long-term therapy.20,39

Lapatinib

Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 ap-
proved  in  2007  by  the  US  FDA.73  Lapatinib  has  shown 
promising effects in breast cancer metastasis to the brain, 
and with further research and clinical trials it may be a 
potential treatment option for vestibular schwannoma.34,59 
Ammoun and colleagues4 found that lapatinib inhibited 
ERBB2  phosphorylation  and  resulted  in  decreased  pro-
liferation  of  vestibular  schwannoma  in  vitro.  Currently, 
there is an ongoing “Phase 0” clinical trial assessing the 
effects of lapatinib on tumor tissue. Enrollment require-
ments include: 1) being scheduled for vestibular schwan-
noma  surgery,  2)  lapatinib  given  before  surgery,  and  3) 
consent  to  have  the  tumor  analyzed  postoperatively  to 
look  for  presence  of  lapatnib.48  The  trial  is  currently 
studying  the  drug’s  ability  to  reach  the  tumor  site,  and 
if  successful,  the  investigators  may  move  it  to  Phase  II 
trials.48

PAK Inhibitor

One group used a small-molecule PAK inhibitor, IPA-
3, to further elucidate the role of PAK activation on Rac1. 
IPA-3 is a direct, noncompetitive inhibitor of PAK1 that 
works by targeting its activation and its autoregulation.23 
Flaiz and associates29,30 found that IPA-3 does block PAK, 
resulting in decreased Rac1 activation.

Conclusions

Vestibular schwannomas are tumors of cranial nerve 
VIII that are related to the NF2 gene and its product, mer-
lin. Merlin acts as a tumor suppressor and as a mediator of 
contact inhibition. Thus, deficiencies in both NF2 genes 
lead  to  vestibular  schwannoma  development.  Merlin  is 
intricately involved with a number of receptors including 
the CD44 receptor, EGFR, and signaling pathways, such 
as the Ras/raf pathway and the canonical Wnt pathway. 
Recently, merlin has also been shown to interact in the 
nucleus  with  E3  ubiquitin  ligase  CRL4DCAF1.  A  greater 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind ves-
tibular  schwannoma  tumorigenesis  has  begun  to  yield 
novel therapies. With further research, it may be possible 
to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality rates 
by decreasing tumor burden, tumor volume, hearing loss, 
and cranial nerve deficits seen in vestibular schwannoma.
