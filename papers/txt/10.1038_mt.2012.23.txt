Gene  therapy  with  ex  vivo-transduced  hematopoietic 
stem/progenitor  cells  may  represent  a  valid  therapeu-
tic option for monogenic immunohematological disor-
ders such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), a primary 
immunodeficiency  associated  with  thrombocytopenia. 
We evaluated the preclinical safety and efficacy of human 
CD34+ cells transduced with lentiviral vectors (LV) encod-
ing WAS protein (WASp). We first set up and validated a 
transduction protocol for CD34+ cells derived from bone 
marrow (BM) or mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) using 
a clinical grade, highly purified LV. Robust transduction 
of progenitor cells was obtained in normal donors and 
WAS patients’ cells, without evidence of toxicity. To study 
biodistribution of human cells and exclude vector release 
in vivo, LV-transduced CD34+ cells were transplanted in 
immunodeficient mice, showing a normal engraftment 
and differentiation ability towards transduced lymphoid 
and myeloid cells in hematopoietic tissues. Vector mobi-
lization to host cells and transmission to germline cells 
of the LV were excluded by different molecular assays. 
Analysis  of  vector  integrations  showed  polyclonal  inte-
gration  patterns  in  vitro  and  in  human  engrafted  cells 
in vivo. In summary, this work establishes the preclinical 
safety and efficacy of human CD34+ cells gene therapy 
for the treatment of WAS.

IntroductIon
Transplantation  of  autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cells  (HSC) 
genetically  modified  ex  vivo  using  viral  vectors  represents  a 
potentially  curative  treatment  for  inherited  disorders  of  the 

hematopoietic system, including primary immunodeficiencies.1,2 
Clinical  trials  for  severe  combined  immunodeficiency  (SCID) 
due  to  adenosine  deaminase  deficiency3  or  IL2RG-deficiency 
(X-linked  severe  combined  immunodeficiency  (SCID-X1))4,5 
have shown that gene therapy with retrovirally transduced HSC 
results in long-term clinical efficacy. However, gene modification 
by γ-retroviral vectors, likely in combination with disease-specific 
factors, resulted in insertional mutagenesis in the clinical trials for 
SCID-X16,7 and chronic granulomatous disease.8 Self-inactivating 
lentiviral vectors (LV) may represent a substantial improvement 
in terms of safety profile while offering a more robust transduc-
tion and better transcriptional control of transgene expression in 
HSC.9 Two recent studies for the treatment of X-linked adreno-
leukodystrophy10 and β-thalassemia11 have provided information 
on the experimental clinical use of LV-transduced CD34+ cells. 
In the adrenoleukodystrophy trial, highly polyclonal multilineage 
engraftment of gene corrected cells at substantial levels (15%) and 
clear  therapeutic  benefits  were  observed.  In  the  β-thalassemia 
study, transduced CD34+ cells failed to engraft in the first patient 
while  the  second  patient  showed  oligoclonal  HSC  engraftment 
associated with a dominant clone reaching ~15% of the cells and 
leading to independency from red blood cell transfusion.11

Wiskott-Aldrich  Syndrome  (WAS)  is  an  excellent  candidate 
for a gene therapy approach in patients lacking a suitable donor or 
at high risk of complications.12,13 WAS is a rare and severe X-linked 
immunodeficiency  characterized  by  eczema,  platelet  defects, 
recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and increased susceptibility 
to develop tumors, in particular lymphomas.14,15 The disorder is 
caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the WAS protein 
(WASp),16 preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cell lineages 
and involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, leading to dif-
ferent  cellular  dysfunctions  such  as  migration,  signal  transduc-
tion, and activation.17,18

Lentiviral Vector-mediated Transduction of WAS HSC

© The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy

The recent report that WAS-gene transfer using a γ-retroviral 
vector resulted in improved platelet counts and immune functions 
further supports the rationale for a gene therapy strategy for this 
disease.19,20 On the other hand, the occurrence of leukemia associ-
ated to an insertion near the LMO2 gene21 in this trial reinforces 
the need for a potentially safer vector platform to deliver the WAS 
transgene.

We have developed an HSC gene therapy approach based on 
lentiviral-mediated  gene  transfer  of  WAS  complementary  DNA 
under the control of a 1.6 kb fragment of the endogenous WAS 
promoter.  We  previously  showed  that  transplantation  of  gene 
corrected WAS-deficient murine HSC in non-lethally irradiated 
Was−/−  mice  resulted  in  long-term  multilineage  engraftment  of 
WASp-expressing cells and functional correction of lymphocyte 
and dendritic cells with a lack of observable toxicity over a short- 
and long-term period.22,23 Moreover, the vector was able to restore 
in vitro expression of WASp in CD34+ cells and mature cells from 
WAS patients.24,25

The  recently  issued  European  regulation  on  Advanced 
Therapy Medicinal Products26 define genetically modified HSC 
as the Medicinal Product, and guidelines detailing nonclinical 
aspects  of  medicinal  products  containing  genetically  modified 
cells are in preparation by regulatory authorities. Crucial param-
eters to be assessed include the dose of vector required for thera-
peutic efficacy, the in vitro toxicity of the vector, the profile of 
vector integration, the dose of transduced cells available at the 
end of the manufacturing process, the in vivo biodistribution of 
transduced cells, and the potential for vector release and germ-
line  transmission.  Although  in  vitro  tests  for  human  HSC  are 
well defined, surrogate in vivo assays may rely on transplanta-
tion of transduced CD34+ cells in humanized immunodeficient 
mouse  models.27,28  Several  investigators  have  employed  these 
assays to study the properties of transduced cells as part of their 
preclinical studies,29–31 but not all aspects related to pharmaco-
logical and toxicological properties of transduced CD34+ cells 
have been previously addressed.

The  aim  of  our  study  was  to  develop  a  clinically  applicable 
transduction protocol for human CD34+ cells using a purified good 
manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade lentiviral vector for the treat-
ment of WAS and to assess the safety and efficacy in relevant in vitro 
and in vivo preclinical assays. Our results show robust transduction 
of CD34+ cells from bone marrow (BM) and mobilized peripheral 
blood  (MPB)  of  healthy  donors  (HD)  and  WAS  patients,  in  the 
absence  of  detectable  toxicity,  allowing  to  validate  manufactur-
ing process. Transduced CD34+ cells infused in immunodeficient 
mice were able to repopulate and differentiate into multiple lineages 
with a polyclonal profile of vector integrations, in the absence of 
vector shedding and germline transmission. Results from this and 
previous studies have provided the rationale and preclinical data to 
launch a clinical trial for HSC gene therapy of WAS.

results
effect of prestimulation time and multiplicity of 
infection of lV on transduction efficiency, growth, 
and progenitor cell content
We  aimed  at  identifying  the  culture  conditions  and  vector 
exposure for clinically applicable efficient LV gene transfer into 

CD34+ cells without toxicity using serum-free medium, early-
acting cytokines, and retronectin. We first investigated the effect 
of different vector doses on human HD CD34+ cells from BM or 
MPB prestimulated for 24 hours. Cells were analyzed by PCR for 
vector copy number (VCN), 12–15 days after transduction when 
only integrated copies are detected by the assay (Supplementary 
Figure S1). As shown in Figure 1a, we found a dose effect for 
both  vector  and  number  of  exposures,  reaching  the  highest 
transduction efficiency (0.84 ± 0.63) at two rounds of transduc-
tion with a multiplicity of infection of 100 (corresponding to a 1 
× 108 TU/ml), with a cumulative dose of 2 × 108 TU/ml.

We  then  studied  the  effect  of  different  prestimulation  times 
(24 or 48 hours) on CD34+ cells followed by a single hit of trans-
duction in comparison to two hits of transduction. After a single 
hit, VCN was similar after 24 or 48 hour prestimulation. Two hits 
exposure to LV resulted in higher VCN versus one hit for both 
MPB  and  BM,  with  BM  being  transduced  at  an  increased  effi-
ciency with respect to MPB (1.1 versus 0.5, paired t-test; P value = 
0.003) (Figure 1b,c).

Expression of CD34 cell surface marker, clonogenic potential, 
and yield of recovered CD34+ cells after culture did not show sig-
nificant  differences  compared  to  untransduced  (UT)  cells  in  all 
conditions (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). As expected, there 
was a tendency toward a decrease in the percentage of CD34+ cells 
after 48 hours prestimulation in the two hits protocols due to the 
longer period of culture (Supplementary Table S2).

Finally,  we  showed  that  transduced  CD34+  cells  display 
a  normal  content  in  primitive  progenitor  cells  (long-term 
 culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC)) as compared to UT (Figure 1d). 
In conclusion, a 60-hour culture and two hits exposure under clin-
ical grade conditions results in efficient transduction of CD34+ 
cells  without  detectable  impact  on  growth  and  differentiation 
capacity of transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

efficient transduction of WAs patients’ cd34+ cells 
using a clinical grade lV
Next,  we  transferred  the  optimized  protocol  to  WASp-deficient 
CD34+ cells obtained from patients’ BM or MPB and investigated 
the efficiency of gene transfer in bulk cultures. Similarly to HD, 
also WAS CD34+ cells exposed to two hits of infections had a sig-
nificantly increased VCN as compared to one hit (1.44 ± 0.48 ver-
sus 0.64 ± 0.31) (Figure 2a). To verify transduction efficiency at 
the single progenitor cell level, we measured the percentage of LV 
positive colony-forming cell (CFC) colonies by quantitative PCR 
(qPCR). As shown in Figure 2b, the second hit of LV increased the 
percentage of transduction from 33.5 ± 13.7 to 53.8 ± 15.8 in HD 
and from 49.0 ± 20.3 to 79.9 ± 14.1 in WAS patients. Intriguingly, 
WAS patients’ CD34+ cells showed a higher VCN and gene trans-
fer into progenitor cells as compared to both HD BM- and MPB-
derived cells in all conditions. Importantly, there were no marked 
differences between transduced and UT cells in terms of growth, 
CD34 expression, total number of CFC colonies, and proportion 
of progenitors (erythroid, myeloid or mixed colonies) (Table 1 and 
data not shown). In WAS BM CD34+ cells, we observed a reduced 
recovery of cells after thawing and a decreased growth capacity and 
number of colony-forming cells versus HD CD34+ cells, without 
difference between UT and transduced cells (data not shown).

To further validate the selected protocol for use in WAS patients, 
three experiments were performed under large scale GMP condi-
tions on BM CD34+ cells. CD34+ cells (12.5 × 106 cells) from HD 

were cultured in retronectin-coated bags in serum-free medium 
supplemented with cytokines and exposed twice to GMP grade 
purified vector at multiplicity of infection of 100, for a total  culture 
time of 60 hours. As reported in Table 2, CD34 cell surface expres-
sion (72.8 ± 4.2%) and yield at the end of culture (1.22 ± 0.20)

were in the range of small scale experiments, with no evidence 
of toxicity on bulk cultures or on clonogenic progenitors. In vitro 
cultured CD34+ cells remained always cytokine-dependent (data 
not shown). Analysis of integrated vector by qPCR in transduced 
cells performed on single CFC colonies, showed robust and repro-
ducible levels of transduction (53–67%). The mean VCN/cell in 
liquid bulk cultures maintained for 15 days after gene transfer was 
0.70 ± 0.10. All quality tests on transduced CD34+ cells were in 
agreement with the specification of the medicinal drug product, 
including cell viability, transgene expression, sterility, mycoplasma, 
endotoxin, replication competent LV, in vitro viral contaminants, 
and process contaminants (E1A DNA, large T antigen protein and 
plasmid DNA, free LV in cell supernatant) (Table 2 and data not 
shown).

lV gene transfer restores WAsp expression in 
differentiated cells from transduced cd34+ cells
To  determine  if  the  clinical  grade  w1.6W  LV  vector  allowed 
restoration  of  WASp  expression,  we  performed  transduction 
on different human cell lines and evaluated the presence of the 
protein by western blot or flow cytometric analysis. As shown in

CD34 expression, yield (ratio of final and initial CD34+ cell number) and total 
number of CFC colonies were evaluated on untransduced and transduced CD34+ 
cells derived from healthy donors and patients’ BM and MPB.

Figure 3, WASp expression was restored to normal levels after 
transduction  of  WASp-deficient  untransformed  T-cell  lines 
(Figure  3a)  and  Epstein–Barr  virus-transformed  B  cell  line 
(Figure 3b).

We  then  analyzed  WASp  expression  in  transduced  CD34+ 
cells  cultured  in  presence  of  cytokines  promoting  the  differen-
tiation to the myeloid lineage and specifically to megakaryocytes 
(MKs).  Two  hits  transduction  with  w1.6W  LV  restored  WASp 
expression in BM or MPB CD34+ cells differentiated from three 
patients, reaching levels comparable to those of HD (Figure 3c) at 
a VCN of 0.7–1.9. Differentiated MKs from UT and transduced 
WASp-deficient CD34+ cells were then evaluated for colocaliza-
tion of WASp with the MKs marker CD41 by confocal micros-
copy. Remarkably, two hits transduction with the LV WAS allowed 
expression of WASp in MKs (Supplementary Figure S2).

normal biodistribution of lV-transduced cd34+ cells 
in rag2−/−/γc−/− mice
In  order  to  investigate  whether  transduction  with  the  w1.6W 
LV  clinical  vector  affects  the  ability  of  human  HSC  to  engraft 
and   differentiate  in  vivo,  we  injected  transduced  HD  umbilical 
cord  blood  (UCB)-derived  CD34+  cells  into  sublethally  irradi-
ated Rag2−/−/γc−/− neonate mice (VCN of CD34+ cells differenti-
ated in vitro 1.8 ± 1.5). Control animals were transplanted with 
the same amount of UT and unmanipulated (UM) UCB CD34+ 
cells.  After  8  weeks,  the  biodistribution  of  human-derived  cells 
was analyzed in different organs by flow cytometry (a representa-
tive example of the analysis is shown in Supplementary Figure 
S3). As shown in Figure 4a, the engraftment of human CD45+ 
cells was comparable to mice injected with UCB-derived UM and 
UT cells in all organs tested (BM, thymus, spleen, and liver). As 
expected, we found a majority of CD19+ cells, and a small propor-
tion of CD34+ progenitor cells and CD13+ myeloid cells in the 
BM and spleen of transplanted mice (Figure 4b,c). In the thymus, 
we observed a normal pattern of T-cell differentiation with pres-
ence of all subsets (CD4/CD8 double positive cells, single positive) 
(Figure  4d).  No  significant  differences  were  observed  between 
different  treatment  groups  either  in  terms  of  level  of  engraft-
ment or differentiation pattern in tested organs. To confirm the 
engraftment capacity of BM-derived cells, we injected transduced 
BM  CD34+  obtained  from  large  scale  transduction  validation 
experiments (VCN: 0.7 ± 0.1), for which UM control cells were 
not available in sufficient number. As expected, BM-derived cells 
had lower levels of engraftment with respect to UCB (Figure 4e) 
with a similar pattern of differentiation (Figure 4f). As shown in

organs, including BM (VCN 1.86 ± 1.31 for UCB and 1.07 ± 0.56 
for BM), thymus (VCN 1.11 ± 0.92 for UCB and 1.08 ± 0.56 for 
BM), spleen (VCN 1.95 ± 1.78 for UCB and 0.48 ± 0.18 for BM), 
and liver (VCN 1.09 ± 0.87 for UCB and 0.43 ± 0.11 for BM).

Analyses of vector shedding, mobilization, and 
germline transmission of lV-transduced cd34+ cells
To assess the safety of the drug product, we first performed experi-
ments to investigate whether infectious vector particles were able to 
remain associated with gene corrected cells and potentially trans-
duce bystander cells, as shown previously in a mouse model.32 To 
exclude the occurrence of in vivo generation of  replication com-
petent lentivirus (RCL), vector mobilization or shedding to non-
target cells including germline, we followed different approaches 
exploiting the model of immunodeficient mice transplanted with 
transduced CD34+ cells.

To  investigate  vector  shedding  and  germline  transmission, 
we  designed  specific  experiments  collecting  gonads  and  brains 
of male mice (n = 7) injected with human BM- or UCB-derived 
transduced  CD34+  cells  and  perfused  with  saline  solution, 
before  harvest,  to  reduce  organ  contamination  with  circulating 
hematopoietic cells. As negative control, brains were used. No vec-
tor signal was detected by qPCR (sensitivity threshold: <16 copies 
in 105 cells) in these organs, indicating the absence of detectable 
vector shedding to nonhematopoietic tissues, including the ger-
mline (data not shown).

To exclude the transfer of packaging function or generation of 
RCL, we then measured gag p24 HIV by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) in the plasma of 17 mice transplanted 
with  LV-WAS  transduced  CD34+  cells.  All  animals  tested  were 
negative except for a mouse that displayed a low-level of protein 

(0.4 ng/ml). HIV-1 gag sequence was detected by PCR on the BM 
of positive mice, but there was no evidence of gag integrated in 
the infused CD34+ cells and the RCL culture assays were negative 
both on infused CD34+ cells and on BM from the transplanted 
mouse. More detailed analyses using specific PCR primers indi-
cated the presence of gag-pol packaging plasmid sequences in the 
original configuration, but not recombined with viral long termi-
nal repeat or transfer vector sequences in the mouse BM (data not 
shown).

To assay the potential mobilization or shedding of vector cells 
to  bystander  cells,  we  designed  a  novel  PCR  assay  (B2-SINE) 
that distinguishes between LV integrated in murine cells versus 
human  cells.  This  method  has  a  high  sensitivity  (up  to  0.25% 
transduction, 35 transduced genomes into 14,000 UT ones) and 
specificity (no signal is detected in 100% human transduced cells) 
(Supplementary  Figure  S4).  No  evidence  of  vector  sequences 
integrated  in  the  murine  genome  from  human  to  murine  cells 
was  reported  in  murine  tissues  (Supplementary  Figure  S5a), 
including  BM  from  the  mouse  that  was  found  positive  for  p24 
(Supplementary Figure S5b).

lV insertion profile from in vitro cultured cd34+ cells 
and human cells engrafted in vivo are polyclonal
In order to study the integration profile of w1.6W LV vector and 
the  clonal  repertoire  of  transduced  cells,  we  collected  insertion 
sites  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  through  the  combination  of  ligation-
mediated/linear  amplification-mediated  PCR  (LM/LAM-PCR) 
and pyrosequencing. We analyzed the distribution of the vector in 
CD34+ cells from a pool of four HD BM and transduced human 
UCB in vitro and in vivo upon engraftment in Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice. 
The insertion profile in vitro was typical of the LV vectors with sig-
nificant preference for transcriptional units (from 74.5 to 77.0%

tions (n = 100,000, 40.7%) (P < 0.01, z-test for two proportions) 
(Supplementary Table S3).

This general bias was maintained in vivo, 8 weeks after trans-
duced cell infusion in Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice. As for the frequency of 
integration sites in proximity of genes involved in “Cancer” disease 
category  from  IPA  software  (Ingenuity  Systems,  http://www.inge-
nuity.com) we did not found any enrichment in vivo as compared 
to random frequency (6.3% in both HD and WAS patients versus 
16.1% in random in silico insertions dataset; hit “Cancer” genes are 

listed in Supplementary Table S4). The number of unique inser-
tions retrieved was in agreement with the overall profile of the LAM-
PCR  products  run  on  Spreadex  gels  (Elchrom  Scientific,  Zurich, 
Swizerland), showing a polyclonal repertoire both in vitro in human 
CD34+ cells from HD and WAS patients (Figure 5a) and in vivo 
upon  infusion  in  Rag2−/−/γc−/−  mice  (Figure  5b).  In  addition,  by 
comparing the insertions in vivo in BM and thymus from individual 
treated mice or in BM, thymus, and spleen from a pool of three mice, 
we observed the presence of shared identical integrants among the 
different hematopoietic compartments analyzed (Figure 5c).

Lentiviral Vector-mediated Transduction of WAS HSC

dIscussIon
Transplant of ex vivo gene corrected HSC could represent a valid 
therapeutic option for patients affected by WAS. Our results indi-
cate that the clinical grade WAS-encoding LV under the control of 
its own promoter can transduce at high efficiency human CD34+ 
progenitor cells from HD and WAS patients’ in a dose-dependent 
manner, and drive protein expression in differentiated cells. The 
two  hit  protocol  allowed  us  to  reach  1–2  copies  of  vector  per 
cells, shown to be required to achieve functional correction of the 
WAS defect,23,24 and was thus selected for validation and clinical 
development.

No detectable toxic effect on the growth and in vitro or in vivo 
differentiation of CD34+ cells were observed. We cannot rule out 
the two hits protocol (60 hours culture), may reduce the in vivo 

engraftment  properties  of  hematopoietic  stem  and  progenitor 
cells with respect to one hit protocol. It should be noted that the 
selected  protocol  is  shorter  than  the  one  previously  adopted  in 
γ-retroviral  vector-based  trials.  Long-term  studies  in  humans 
will  allow  to  determine  the  engraftment  capacity  of  transduced 
CD34+ cells at the moment of the infusion.

WAS patient-derived cells displayed an overall reduced capac-
ity to grow in culture when exposed to cytokines as compared to 
HD cells, likely as a result of a defect in cell signaling or prolif-
eration. Indeed, a key role for WASp in signaling of the cytokine 
receptor for stem cell factor (c-Kit) has been identified in murine 
hematopoietic cells.33 The higher efficiency of gene transfer into 
WAS CD34+ cells as compared to HD may be related to a higher 
susceptibility to infection from LV of WASp-deficient cells, possibly

related to alterations in entry and post-entry processing of LV due 
to the absence of the protein. However, we cannot exclude that 
in vitro corrected WAS cells might have a selective advantage over 
UT cells, in agreement with the observed in vitro selective advan-
tage for BM cells from WASp-heterozygous mice.33

Since the experimental medicinal product is represented by the 
autologous transduced CD34+ cells and there is limited clinical 
experience with the ex vivo use of LV, we designed assays to assess 
biodistribution and the potential risk of vector shedding, mobili-
zation, and germline transmission using the relevant human target 
cells in in vitro and in vivo models.27 Our results show that WAS 
LV transduced healthy HSC migrate to the lymphohematopoietic 
organs and undergo in vivo short-term differentiation similarly to 
UT and unmanipulated HSC. Despite their limitations, our data 
combined to previous observations28,30,31 indicate that immunode-
ficient mice could represent a suitable model for assessing biodis-
tribution and safety of human CD34+ cells from different sources. 
The  sensitivity  and  observation  time  may  be  further  improved 
by the use of novel immunodeficient strains which allow higher 
engraftment of human cells.34

Even though viral vector particles might be associated to the 
drug product at the end of the manufacturing process, our data 
show that LV distributes along with human hematopoietic cells, 
remaining  integrated  in  the  human  genome  and  is  not  mobi-
lized or shed to murine cells, as assessed by different approaches. 
In addition to the classical techniques for the analysis of vector 
biodistribution,  we  developed  a  new  technique  adapting  and 
improving  the  B2  SINE-PCR  from  Follenzi  et  al.35  Differently 
from conventional methods, this approach allows to distinguish 
between  episomal  and  integrated  form  in  unwanted  target.  In 
addition,  integrated  vector  can  be  detected  in  several  tissues 
including germ lines where silencing of transgene could mask the 
vector presence. The detection of HIV gag sequences in the BM 
of one mouse together with the evidence of HIV p24 gag antigen 
in the plasma raised the remote possibility that a RCL may have 
been  generated,  although  such  an  event  should  have  occurred 
during cell transduction as the virus batch was tested for RCL and 
shown  to  be  negative.  However,  the  safety  features  of  the  third 
generation packaging system combined with a SIN transfer vec-
tor used in this study make it extremely unlikely that a productive 
viral recombinant is generated during vector production or cell 
transduction. Indeed, no RCL was detected in the mouse tissue 
samples by the RCL assay. Thus, the most likely interpretation of 
the findings is the occurrence of a stable transfection of the pack-
aging plasmid in a rare cell engrafted in the mouse. This is pos-
sible given that the plasmids used for the transient transfection 
of the vector-producer cells represent a major contaminant of the 
final vector product, even if the downstream purification process 
removes almost 99.9% of the input. This event was not deemed to 
be associated with pathology because it did not represent RCL nor 
it would lead to vector mobilization because the Gag-containing 
particles released from the cells would lack an envelope to make 
them infectious as well as a viral RNA, as the transduced SIN vec-
tor would be resistant to packaging and mobilization. If such Gag-
expressing cells were to be infused in a patient their output would 
be diluted in the larger body fluids to well below detection and, 
most likely, the cells would be cleared by viral antigen-directed 

immunity (at variance with its survival in the immunocompro-
mised SCID mouse).

The analysis of vector integrations in vitro and in vivo showed 
a  strong  bias  of  WAS  vector  for  coding  regions  without  major 
preference  for  regions  upstream  of  transcription  start  sites,  a 
feature  typical  of  lentiviral  vectors10,36  (Supplementary  Table 
S3), and proto-oncogenes (Supplementary Table S4). The inser-
tional profile was polyclonal in human CD34+ cells both in vitro 
and after engraftment and selection in vivo in Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice 
(Figure 5b), in agreement with the results of preclinical studies of 
WAS-LV integration in murine cells.37

A gene therapy approach based on a γ-retroviral vector encod-
ing WASp under the control of a strong viral promoter (myelopro-
liferative sarcoma virus (MPSV)) showed the therapeutic potential20 
of this approach but was associated with the occurrence of leukemia 
in a patient.21 In this regard, the implementation of a LV platform in 
combination with a moderately active internal promoter should con-
fer a substantially improved safety profile9,38 over the MLV approach.
In summary, our data demonstrate that the GMP grade WAS-
encoding LV can efficiently transduce CD34+ cells under validated 
clinical  conditions,  leading  to  restoration  of  protein  expression 
with no toxicity. This study provides important information about 
the quality and preclinical safety and efficacy data on transduced 
HSC for WAS patients complementing previous in vitro and in vivo 
studies performed in the murine WAS KO model which showed 
efficient  engraftment  of  vector-transduced  cells  and  immune 
reconstitution without the occurrence of LV-induced tumors.22,23 
Phase  I/II  gene  therapy  clinical  protocols  based  on  infusion  of 
LV-transduced autologous CD34+ cells combined with a reduced 
intensity conditioning received approval from regulatory authori-
ties and have recently started by our and other groups.39,40

Patients’  and  healthy  donor  cells. HDs granulocyte colony- stimulating 
factor  MPB-  or  BM-  derived  CD34+  cells  were  purchased  from  Lonza 
(Basel, Switzerland). HD UCB and WAS patients’ BM cells were obtained 
after  written  informed  consent  according  to  standard  ethical  procedure 
and  with  approval  of  the  San  Raffaele  Institute  Bioethical  Committee 
 (protocol TIGET-01 and -02). Biological material from six WAS patients 
(score 3–5), diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and genetic analy-
sis41,42 (Supplementary Table S5), was obtained at the time of diagnostic 
or therapeutic procedures. WASp expression was not detectable by western 
blot in patients’ cells except for a weak expression observed in patient 3. 
CD34+ cells were purified from mononuclear cells by positive selection 
with immunomagnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s procedure 
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany).

LV.  The  vector  used  in  this  study  (w1.6W)  is  a  3rd  generation,  self-
 inactivating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV.G) pseudotype lentiviral vector 
constructed on a pCCL backbone, previously described23 (Supplementary 
Figure S6a). The vector lots were produced by MolMed S.p.a. (Milan, Italy), 
using a large scale validated process. The vectors were produced  following 
GMP guidelines, except for initial studies of gene transfer protocol optimi-
zation, which were research grade. Vector characterization is reported in 
Supplementary Table S6.
Cell culture and transduction. CD34+ cells were seeded on non-tissue cul-
ture treated Retronectin (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) coated plates (30 μg/
ml)  or,  for  GMP  manufacturing  validation,  in  VueLife  bags  (American 
Fluoroseal, Gaithersburg, MD) at 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free CellGro

Lentiviral Vector-mediated Transduction of WAS HSC

SCGM Medium (Cell Genix Technologies, Friburg, Germany) in the pres-
ence of cells culture grade stem cell factor 300 ng/ml (Amgen, Thousand 
Oaks, CA), FLT3-L 300 ng/ml, Thrombopoietin 100 ng/ml, and IL-3 60 ng/
ml (all from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NY). Following different prestimula-
tion times, cells were transduced with w1.6W LV at different multiplicity 
of infection for one or two hits of transduction. For the two hits protocol, a 
wash period of 10–12 hours was performed between the vector exposures. 
At the end, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of 
CD34 and CD45 cell surface markers, plated for colony-forming unit cells 
(CFU-C)  and  LTC-IC  assays  or  cultured  (described  in  Supplementary 
Materials  and  Methods)  to  perform  proviral  integration  evaluation  by 
qPCR,  WASp  expression  measurement,  and  integration  profile  analysis. 
This culture method promotes the differentiation of CD34+ cells toward 
myeloid lineage.

Epstein–Barr virus-transformed B cell lines and untransformed T-cell 

lines were established and transduced as previously described.25

Western blot analysis. Western blot analyses was performed as previously 
described,24 using anti-hWASP (H250; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa 
Cruz, CA), anti-hGAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and anti-hActin 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) antibodies, followed by secondary HRP-
coupled antibodies (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark).

Mice. Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice on BALB/c background were obtained from the 
Central  Institute  for  Experimental  Animals  (Nogawa,  Japan).  All  ani-
mals were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facil-
ity.  Procedures  were  performed  according  to  protocols  approved  by  the 
Committee  for  Animal  Care  and  Use  of  San  Raffaele  Scientific  Institute 
(Committee Protocol no. 318). Three to four days after birth, mice were irra-
diated with two doses of 3 and 2.5 Gy, given at 3 hours interval. Three hours 
after irradiation, mice were injected with 0.3 × 106 UCB cells or 0.7 × 106 
BM cells in 25–30 µl phosphate-buffered saline into the temporal vein.

After 8 weeks, mice were euthanized and organs were collected and 
analyzed for the presence of human CD45+ cells and the expression of 
different  lineage-specific  surface  markers.  For  collection  of  gonads 
and  brain,  mice  were  perfused  injecting  saline  solution  for  10  minutes 
through blood vessels of mice to eliminate hematopoietic contamination 
from organs, before sacrifice. Cells were analyzed for proviral integration 
evaluation by qPCR and integration profile by LAM-PCR analyses.

Real-time PCR analysis. In order to evaluate the number of LV copies inte-
grated per genome, a qPCR was performed using specific primer and probes 
for human telomerase, LV, and murine β-actin. A reference standard was 
obtained from serially diluted transduced human T-cell line  carrying one 
copy of integrated LV. Results of integrated vector copies were  normalized 
for the number of evaluated genomes. As negative control, samples of UT 
cells were used. All the reactions were performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions and analyzed with an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence 
detection  system  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA).  Primers  and 
probes sequences were reported in Supplementary Table S7

Flow  cytometric  analysis.  Surface  staining  of  transduced  HSC  was  per-
formed with anti-CD34-PE and CD45-PerCP monoclonal antibodies. Cells 
collected from the organs of Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice were stained for the expres-
sion of surface markers: CD45-APC, CD19-PC7, CD34-PC5, CD3-FITC, 
CD4-PerCP, CD8-PE, CD13-PE, and CD15-FITC (all from BD Biosciences, 
San Jose, CA). Detection of WASp expression was performed after permea-
bilization (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD Biosciences) by a purified anti-hWASp 
monoclonal antibody (clone 5A5; BD Biosciences)  followed by an Alexa 488 
conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were 
acquired using a FACSCantoII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed 
with FCS Express Software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA).

Evaluation  of  p24  by  ELISA  assay  and  RCL  detection.  HIV  p24  pro-
tein concentration was measured in mice plasma collected 7 weeks after 

 UCB-transduced CD34+ cell injection or culture supernatants by Alliance 
HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) according to manu-
facturer’s instructions

The  RCL  assay  was  performed  according  to  published  method.43,44 
Briefly,  permissive  C8166-45  cell  line  were  cocultured  with  transduced 
CD34+ cells and cultured for 28 days. At the end of the culture, HIV p24 
protein presence was determined by ELISA assay on culture supernatant. 
Moreover, C8166-45 genomic DNA was extracted to verify the absence of 
VSV-G DNA by qPCR.

B2-SINE PCR for detecting murine-specific integrations. In order to detect 
the presence of integrated LV in murine genome after systemic injection of 
human CD34+ transduced cells, we performed a modified and improved 
three-step  B2  SINE-PCR  technique35  (Supplementary  Figure  S6b). 
Sequences of primers and PCR conditions are reported in Supplementary 
Materials and Methods.

Integration  profile  analyses. Integrations were retrieved by LAM-PCR, 
as  previously  described.9,45  Briefly,  after  a  linear  PCR  amplification  of 
genome-vector  junctions,  followed  by  a  magnetic  capture  and  second 
strand   reconstitution,  a  digestion  with  Tsp509I,  HpyCH4IV  or  MseI 
was  performed.  Digestion  products  were  ligated  with  a  restriction  site-
 complementary linker cassette and underwent to two sequential rounds 
of  exponential  PCR  steps.  The  LAM-PCR  products  were  tagged  with 
megaprimers  and  underwent  454  pyrosequencing.  Resulting  genomic 
sequences  were  automatically  aligned  to  the  human  genome  (assembly 
hg18 of the UCSC genome browser, http://genome.ucsc.edu/).

Statistical  analysis.  Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  GraphPad 
Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), analyzing data sets for 
significance by Mann–Whitney two-tailed test, unless otherwise stated.
