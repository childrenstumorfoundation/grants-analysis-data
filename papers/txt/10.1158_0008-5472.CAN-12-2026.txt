Abstract

In contrast to normal cells, malignant cells are frequently aneuploid and contain multiple centrosomes. To allow
for bipolar mitotic division, supernumerary centrosomes are clustered into two functional spindle poles in many
cancer cells. Recently, we have shown that griseofulvin forces tumor cells with supernumerary centrosomes to
undergo multipolar mitoses resulting in apoptotic cell death. Here, we describe the characterization of the novel
small molecule GF-15, a derivative of griseofulvin, as a potent inhibitor of centrosomal clustering in malignant cells.
At concentrations where GF-15 had no signiﬁcant impact on tubulin polymerization, spindle tension was markedly
reduced in mitotic cells upon exposure to GF-15. Moreover, isogenic cells with conditional centrosome ampliﬁcation
were more sensitive to GF-15 than parental controls. In a wide array of tumor cell lines, mean inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) for proliferation and survival were in the range of 1 to 5 mmol/L and were associated with
apoptotic cell death. Importantly, treatment of mouse xenograft models of human colon cancer and multiple
myeloma resulted in tumor growth inhibition and signiﬁcantly prolonged survival. These results show the in vitro
and in vivo antitumor efﬁcacy of a prototype small molecule inhibitor of centrosomal clustering and strongly support
the further evaluation of this new class of molecules. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5374–85. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

Centrosomes are small cytoplasmic organelles, which con-
sist of a pair of centrioles embedded in pericentriolar material
and act as microtubule-organizing centers. During mitosis,
centrosomes function as spindle poles, directing the formation
of bipolar spindles, a process essential for accurate chromo-
somal segregation (1, 2). Centrosomes duplicate precisely once
per cell cycle to assure spindle bipolarity, with each daughter

cell receiving one centrosome upon cytokinesis. Centrosome
ampliﬁcation is frequent in both solid tumors and hematologic
malignancies, and is linked to tumorigenesis and aneuploidy
(3–10). The extent of centrosomal aberrations correlates with
the degree of chromosomal instability and malignant behavior
in tumor cell lines, mouse tumor models, and human tumors
(6, 9–12).

In mitosis, supernumerary centrosomes can lead to the
formation of multipolar spindles, which is a hallmark of many
tumor types (8). Multipolar cell division, however, is antago-
nistic to cell viability (13, 14). Most progeny derived from a
multipolar mitosis will undergo apoptosis. To circumvent this
problem, many cancer cells seem to have mechanisms that
suppress multipolar division, the best studied being clustering
of supernumerary centrosomes into 2 spindle poles enabling
bipolar division (8, 13–20). Bipolar spindle formation via
centrosomal clustering is associated with an increased fre-
quency of lagging chromosomes during anaphase, thereby
explaining the link between supernumerary centrosomes and
chromosomal instability (14, 15).

The mechanisms of centrosomal clustering in tumor cells
are incompletely understood. Recent genome-wide RNAi
screens in cells containing supernumerary centrosomes sug-
gest the involvement of the spindle assembly checkpoint and
spindle tension as controlled by the cortical actin cytoskeleton,
cell adhesion molecules as well as centrosome and kinetochore
components in this process (19, 20).

Supernumerary centrosomes are almost exclusively found
in a wide variety of neoplastic disorders but rarely in

nontransformed cells. Therefore, inhibition of centrosomal
clustering with consequential induction of multipolar spindles
and subsequent cell death would speciﬁcally target tumor cells
with no effect on normal cells with regular centrosome content
(8, 17). Using a phenotype-based screening strategy, we have
recently found that griseofulvin induces spindle multipolarity,
mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death in multiple tumor cell
lines but not in diploid ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes with
normal centrosome content (13). Chemical optimization of
griseofulvin led to the development of compounds with sig-
niﬁcantly increased activity and mean inhibitory concentra-
tions (IC50) of proliferation and survival in the lower micro-
molar range when applied to the human squamous cell car-
cinoma cell line SCC114, which had been used for the initial
screening (21).

Here, we present evidence that the exposure of tumor cells to
the griseofulvin derivative GF-15 leads to reduced spindle
tension, spindle multipolarity, and the inhibition of centroso-
mal clustering, culminating in the induction of apoptosis in
vitro and in vivo.

Cell culture

All human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines (RPMI-8226,
OPM-2, NCI-H929, OPM-1, KMS-12BM, KMS-12PE, KMS-11,
KMS-18, U-266, MM1.S, LR5, Dox40, MM1.R) and primary
patient MM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium sup-
plemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Harlan), 100 U/mL
penicillin, 10 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Cellgro). Leukemia lines used were HEL, MOLM14, and Ku812
and cultured as described above. Solid tumor cell lines com-
prised HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HT29, HCT116, SW480
(colorectal carcinoma), PANC1, PACA1 (pancreatic carcino-
ma), and LN229 (glioblastoma). HS4, KM105, KM104 (bone
marrow stromal cells, BMSC), THLE3 (liver cells), peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and primary BMSCs served
as nonmalignant controls. All solid tumor cell
lines and
nonmalignant controls were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
(Harlan), 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine (Cellgro). All cell
lines are regularly
authenticated by ﬁngerprinting before backup freezing and
are kept less than 4 months in culture.

Isolation of patient tumor cells

Patients provided informed consent in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Following approval by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Heidelberg, MM patient cells
(96% CD38

) were obtained as described (22).

Centrosomal Cluster Inhibition

Cell lysis and immunoblotting

Cell lysis and Western blot analysis were conducted as

described previously (22).

Evaluation of cell viability

Cell viability was examined using the MTT (Sigma Chemical)
colorimetric assay, as previously described (23). Brieﬂy, cells
were plated in 96-well microtitre plates at a density of 2–3 104
cells per well, and each plate was incubated for 24 and/or 48
hours, with MTT added to each well for at least 4 hours. The
absorbance of each well was measured at 570/630 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Each condition was
analyzed in at least 3 replicates, and the results are presented as
the mean  SD of replicates of a representative experiment
that was repeated at least 3 times.

DNA synthesis and cell proliferation assay

Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring [3H]-thymidine

uptake, as described in prior studies (22).

Measurement of caspase-3/7 activation

Caspase-3/7 activation was analyzed using the Apoptosis
Detection Kit from Promega according to the recommenda-
tions of the manufacturer.

Flow cytometry

Cell-cycle analysis by ﬂow cytometry was conducted as

previously described (13).

Immunoﬂuorescence

Immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted as described
(24). The following ﬂuorochrome-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies were used: anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) and
anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
Immunostained cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert
200 M ﬂuorescence microscope. Images were processed with
Photoshop software (Adobe).

Tubulin polymerization assay

The effect of GF-15 on tubulin polymerization was assessed
using the tubulin polymerization assay kit (Cytoskeleton)
according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

Xenograft mouse models
To determine the in vivo activity of GF-15, beige-nude Xid
mice were inoculated s.c. in the right ﬂank with 3  106 OPM2
or HT29 cells in 100 mL RPMI 1640 medium, together with 100
mL matrigel (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). When a tumor
was measurable, mice were assigned to a GF-15 treatment
group or the control group. GF-15 was dissolved in 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and given daily 5 times a week by
intraperitoneal injection for indicated periods. The control
group received the carrier alone at the same schedule and route
of administration. Tumor burden was measured every
alternate day using a calliper [calculated volume ¼ 4p/3 
(width/2)2  (length/2)]. Animals were sacriﬁced when their
tumors reached 2 cm in diameter, became exulcerated, or when
the mice were moribund. Survival was evaluated from the ﬁrst

Scintigraphic in vivo imaging

For imaging studies, 200 mL of a solution of the 125I-labeled
GF-15 analogue (5 MBq/mouse) was injected into the tail vein
of 6-week-old female NMRI mice. Scintigraphic images were
taken using a gamma camera (Biospace). The accumulation of
the radioactive tracer was monitored by static planar images at
5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6
hours, and 24 hours after injection.

Biodistribution studies

131I-labeled GF-15 analogue (1 MBq/mouse) was injected via
the tail vein of 6-week-old female NMRI mice. At the time
points speciﬁed, the animals were sacriﬁced, weighed, and
dissected. Organs or tissues were blotted dry and weighed. The
radioactivity was measured in a g-counter along with a sample
of the injection solution to calculate the percentage of injected
dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).

Stability experiments

The serum stability was determined by incubation of the
125I-labeled GF-15 analogue in human serum at 37
C. Aliquots
were taken at several points in time, and the degradation was
stopped by precipitation of the serum proteins with acetoni-
trile. After incubation for 30 minutes at 0
C and a further
centrifugation step the clear supernatant was analyzed by

GF-15 leads to multipolar mitosis induction in the upper
nanomolar range

Recently, we have shown that 2

-modiﬁed derivatives of
griseofulvin are more potent inducers of multipolar mitosis
when compared with griseofulvin itself (21). Initial testing for
the ability to inhibit centrosomal clustering was conducted in
SCC114 cells, an oral squamous cell carcinoma line showing
pronounced centrosome ampliﬁcation (13, 18). GF-15 (2
-ben-
zyloxy-2
-demethoxygriseofulvin) is signiﬁcantly more potent
with regard to the induction of spindle multipolarity than
griseofulvin (Fig. 1A). The EC50 value of GF-15 for multipolar
spindle induction was 900 nmol/L, corresponding to a 27-fold
increase in activity compared with griseofulvin. Importantly,
SCC114 cells that became resistant to GF-15 after long-term
culture with increasing doses (0.2–1 mmol/L) of the compound
over a period of 10 weeks, showed signiﬁcantly less centrosome
ampliﬁcation and formed fewer multipolar spindles upon
treatment with therapeutic doses (5 mmol/L) of the drug (Fig.
1B, Supplementary Fig. S1).

kinetochores were identiﬁed by spatial correlation of HEC1 and CREST as a marker of the interkinetochore space. Distances between corresponding HEC1
signals were measured. F, GF-15 triggers the spindle assembly checkpoint. PC-3 cells were exposed to DMSO control, taxol (10 nmol/L) as a positive control,

an active spindle assembly checkpoint. G, the effects of increasing concentrations of griseofulvin (GF, left) or GF-15 (right), respectively, on tubulin
polymerization were measured by relative ﬂuorescence intensity. All quantitative data shown are the mean  SD of 3 independent experiments.

15, the PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line, which harbors
supernumerary centrosomes in 28  4% of the cells, was
treated with increasing concentrations of the drug for 24
hours (Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, at the highest analyzable con-
centration (1.5 mmol/L), GF-15 induced centrosome declus-
tering—as deﬁned by the detection of 2 centrioles at each
spindle pole of multipolar mitoses (Fig. 1D)—in 27  4% of
the cells, thereby closely matching the total percentage of
cells with supernumerary centrosomes. At the lowest con-
centration tested (0.375 mM), multipolarity induction was
mostly due to inhibition of centrosomal clustering. With
increasing doses of GF-15, the contribution of multipolarity
induction by other means gradually increased. This phe-
nomenon was arbitrarily termed "aberrant," deﬁned by the
presence of centrioles at only 2 spindle poles despite cells
were undergoing multipolar mitoses. From these results, it
may be concluded that the mechanisms responsible for
holding supernumerary centrosomes together might be sim-
ilar to the forces that bundle microtubules into a bipolar
spindle array in cells with a regular centrosome content.
However, differential sensitivities of both mechanisms may
provide a therapeutic window to preferentially target cen-
trosome clustering at lower dose levels.

Recently, we and others have shown that spindle tension is
required for centrosomal clustering (19, 20). To directly mea-
sure spindle tension, we determined interkinetochore dis-
tances in mitotic PC-3 cells with either bipolar or multipolar
spindles after treatment with 1 mmol/L GF-15 for 24 hours (Fig.
1E). Tension across sister kinetochores was substantially
reduced by GF-15, as indicated by shorter interkinetochore
distances in multipolar metaphase cells. To a lesser but still
signiﬁcant extent,
interkinetochore distances were also
reduced in metaphase cells that remained bipolar despite
treatment with GF-15. If spindle tension is disturbed, the
spindle assembly checkpoint cannot get sufﬁciently satisﬁed
during metaphase and BubR1 should remain at affected kine-
tochores. As shown in Fig. 1F, kinetochores of multipolar
metaphases in GF-15-treated cells stained positive for BubR1
similarly to cells exposed to low-dose taxol, used as a positive
control. In contrast, BubR1 was absent from bipolar meta-
phases in vehicle-treated control cells. Moreover, no MAD2
signal as a marker for disturbed spindle attachment could be
detected at kinetochores of GF-15 induced multipolar meta-
phases, in contrast to kinetochores of cells treated with noco-
dazole as a positive control (data not shown). These ﬁndings
show that GF-15 reduces spindle tension and thereby activates
the spindle assembly checkpoint, but does not disturb micro-
tubule attachment to kinetochores. This corroborates earlier
ﬁndings showing that reduced spindle tension after siRNA-
mediated depletion of kinetochore and spindle components
leads to the formation of multipolar spindles (19, 20).

Effects of griseofulvin and GF-15 on tubulin
polymerization in vitro

To exclude the hypothesis that loss of spindle tension
upon GF-15 exposure is merely a consequence of tubulin
depolymerization, the effects of griseofulvin and GF-15
on the polymerization of puriﬁed porcine brain tubulin

into microtubules in vitro were analyzed using a ﬂuores-
cence assay (26). Corroborating earlier data, inhibition of
brain tubulin polymerization required very high concentra-
tions of griseofulvin (27, 28). Similarly, the GF-15 concentra-
tions needed for
tubulin polymerization
(25 mmol/L) were about 25-fold above those required for
induction of spindle multipolarity (Fig. 1G).

multipolar divisions. Instead they pass through a transient
multipolar intermediate state followed by centrosome clus-
tering and bipolar anaphase (14, 15). To ascertain that GF-15
indeed induces multipolar cell divisions and subsequent cell
death in cells with supernumerary centrosomes, HeLa cells
were induced to contain extra centrioles by conditional over-
expression of PLK4 (28; Supplementary Fig. S2). In these cells,
in the second cell cycle after centriole overduplication, super-
numerary centrioles disengage before duplication and multi-
polar intermediates are common in the following mitosis
(14, 29). Treatment of HeLa–PLK4 cells with increasing con-
centrations of GF-15 for 24 hours, starting 48 hours after
induction of PLK4 expression by addition of doxycycline, led
to a dose-dependent, marked increase in the frequency of
multipolar anaphases with declustered centrosomes (Fig. 2A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, compared with
uninduced cells, GF-15 preferentially decreased the viability
of HeLa cells after PLK4-induced centriole overduplication
(Fig. 2C).

GF-15 is active against a broad spectrum of cancer cell
lines in vitro

leukemia, and myeloma-derived cell

Next, we examined the effect of GF-15 on the growth of
several different cancer cell lines. GF-15 exhibits potent cyto-
toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner against a broad
spectrum of tumor cell types including colon, cervix, glioblas-
toma, pancreas,
lines
(Fig. 3A). As compared with solid tumor cell lines, MM and
leukemia cell lines were particularly susceptible to the cyto-
toxic and antiproliferative effect of GF-15 with IC50 values
ranging from 1 to 2.5 mmol/L. In contrast, GF-15 did not induce
signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in nonmalignant control cell lines (Fig.
3A) or PBMCs from healthy volunteers even after stimulation
with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), providing an overall selectiv-
ity index of 10- to 30-fold when compared with IC50 values of
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that GF-15
exhibits both potent and selective cytotoxicity against malig-
nant cells.

GF-15 is rapidly eliminated in vivo

Derived from its parental molecule griseofulvin, GF-15 has
been modiﬁed at the 2
-position (Fig. 1A). We therefore sought
to analyze the in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics of this
0
new compound. By introducing a p-iodobenzyl group in the 2
-
position of the griseofulvin molecule, we generated a 125I-
labeled GF-15-analogue. HPLC analysis showed only slow
degradation of this molecule in human serum with a half-life

of 48 hours at 37
C. The cleavage products resulting from
degradation are presumably 4-iodobenzyl alcohol and griseo-
fulvic acid, consistent with the analogue undergoing hydrolysis
(data not shown). After i.v. application of trace amounts of this
analogue, rapid renal clearance was observed within the ﬁrst 6
hours after injection (Fig. 3C and D). In light of the clearance
data and the poor solubility of GF-15 at higher concentrations,
we went on to investigate its in vivo efﬁcacy after intraperi-
toneal application.

GF-15 exhibits in vivo antitumor activity in xenograft
mouse models

In view of the potent and selective in vitro activity of GF-15
against different cancer cell lines, we next examined the in vivo
effect of GF-15 on human tumor growth in immunodeﬁcient
mice. Two cohorts, each consisting of 30 immunodeﬁcient
beige-nude-Xid mice were inoculated with either 3 106 OPM2
myeloma or HT29 colon cancer cells s.c. in the right ﬂank.
Treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg (10 mice per cell line)
or 100 mg/kg (10 mice per cell line) intraperitoneally 5 days per
week for 2 weeks was started when tumors became palpable.
Ten mice per cell line served as a control cohort and received
intraperitoneal injections of the vehicle alone. GF-15 treatment
decreased tumor growth in all cohorts of treated mice with a
greater effect in the group that received 100 mg/kg intraper-

itoneally (Figs. 4A, Supplementary Fig. S4). Kaplan–Meier and
log-rank analysis revealed a signiﬁcant prolongation of survival
for the GF-15-treated mice inoculated with OPM2 myeloma
cells compared with the vehicle-treated controls (log-rank P <
0.001; Fig. 4B). For mice inoculated with HT29 colon cancer
cells survival analysis was not feasible because tumors in the
control group rapidly became exulcerated and therefore had to
be sacriﬁced according to institutional regulations. The tox-
icity proﬁle of GF-15 seems to be quite favorable as body weight
was not affected by treatment with GF-15 compared with
untreated controls (Fig. 4C). Importantly, examination of
histologic tumor sections revealed a dose-dependent, signiﬁ-
cant increase of aberrant and multipolar mitoses in the GF-15-
treated mice compared with controls (P < 0.01 for 20 mg/kg, P <
0.001 for 100 mg/kg; Fig. 4D and E). In addition, GF-15
signiﬁcantly increased the mitotic index in treated tumors
versus controls (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Induction of spindle multipolarity, mitotic arrest and
apoptosis by GF-15

As already depicted in Fig. 3A, myeloma cell lines are among
those tumor types with particular susceptibility to GF-15.
Because myeloma cells are known to harbor supernumerary
centrosomes (3–5), we used MM cells as a model system for
further in-depth analyses. Similar to OPM2, RPMI-8226, NCI-

The third panel displays partial declustering of ampliﬁed centrioles resulting in tripolar cell division, whereas the fourth panel represents aberrant multipolarity
in a cell without ampliﬁed centrioles (second centriole at lower pole out of focus). See also Supplementary Fig. S3. Scale bar, 5 mm. C, viable cells were

with relapsed myeloma showed marked cytotoxic effects upon
treatment with GF-15. Lack of efﬁcacy in the remaining 7

Figure 4. GF-15 decreases tumor growth, prolongs survival, and induces mitotic aberrations in a MM xenograft mouse model. A, beige-nude Xid mice were
subcutaneously inoculated in the right ﬂank with 3  106 OPM2 cells. Treatment by intraperitoneal injection (vehicle alone or indicated concentrations
of GF-15) was started when tumors were measurable. Arrows indicate treatment stop. Tumor burden was measured every alternating day using an electronic
caliper. Tumor volume is presented as means  SE. B, survival was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank analysis. C, body weight was
evaluated 3 times per week. Data shown are the mean  SD. , P < 0.01; , P < 0.001. D, in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor sections (n ¼ 3 per cohort),
at least 200 mitotic cells were analyzed for mitotic aberrations. E, dose-dependent effects of GF-15 on mitotic ﬁgures. Parafﬁn-embedded sections of

common phenomenon of primary myeloma cells in tissue
culture. This was in stark contrast to their corresponding
proliferating BMSCs, which displayed virtually no cytotoxicity
when exposed to GF-15 (Fig. 5C). Likewise, after 24 hours of
treatment with 3 mmol/L GF-15, no signiﬁcant induction of
spindle multipolarity could be detected in mitotic primary
BMSCs, whereas more than 80% of mitoses were multipolar in
NCI H929, OPM2, and RPMI 8226 cells (Fig. 5D). To examine the
effect of multipolar mitosis induction on cell-cycle progression,
starvation-synchronized OPM2 cells were exposed to GF-15,
stained with propidium iodide, and subsequently analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry. GF-15 induced a pronounced G2–M cell-cycle
arrest within 12 hours of treatment followed by an increase of
the sub-G1 population compared with mock-treated cells (Fig.
5E, top panel). Indicating the induction of apoptosis, the

increase of the sub-G1 population was concentration-depen-
dent (Fig. 5E, bottom panel), analogous to the effect of gris-
eofulvin in SCC114 cells (13). To further verify apoptotic cell
death triggered by GF-15, protein proﬁling in GF-15-treated
MM cells showed dose-dependent cleavage of caspase-8,
caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP (Fig. 5F). Cleavage fragments
of these proteins became detectable at 0.5 mmol/L and strongly
increased at 3 mmol/L of GF-15. Importantly, exposure of
primary BMSCs to 3 mmol/L of GF-15 for 24 hours did not
induce activation of effector caspases-3 and -7 compared with
OPM2 cells (Fig. 5G).

microenvironment, direct myeloma–stroma contact also trig-
gers tumor cell growth and mediates drug resistance. We
therefore evaluated the effect of GF-15 on myeloma cell
proliferation induced by the stimulatory effect of BMSCs (Fig.
6A and B). Binding of OPM2 or RPMI-8226 cells to primary
BMSCs triggered increased myeloma cell proliferation, which
was completely abrogated by GF-15. Importantly, as also
shown in Figs. 5C and D, GF-15 did not impact on BMSCs,
as determined by MTT assays and spindle polarity analysis.

Evaluation of combinations of GF-15 with other
antimyeloma agents

Clinical experience in the therapeutic management of MM
supports the notion that drug combinations can induce higher
response rates when compared with single-agent treatment
(23, 30). We therefore evaluated the effects of combinations of
GF-15 with other established anti-MM drugs on the viability of
MM cells. Speciﬁcally, GF-15 was combined with conventional
agents (melphalan) as well as with more recently developed
compounds (bortezomib). Although GF-15 together with bor-
tezomib resulted in additive effects according to isobologram
analysis (e.g., CI ¼ 0.98 for 1.5 mmol/L GF-15 with 1.5 nmol/L
bortezomib), the combination with melphalan led to a marked
abrogation of GF-15 induced cytotoxicity (CI¼ 1.4 for 3 mmol/L
GF-15 with 5 mmol/L melphalan, Fig. 6C). This is consistent
with an S-phase arrest induced by the DNA-damaging drug
melphalan, thereby preventing entry into mitosis of melpha-
lan-exposed cells and underlines the speciﬁcity of GF-15 for
cells in G2–M phase of the cell cycle.
Discussion

We show here that GF-15, a derivative of griseofulvin, leads
to multipolar cell division, loss of spindle tension, centrosomal
declustering, and subsequent tumor-speciﬁc cell death both in
tissue culture and in xenograft mouse models.

Griseofulvin has been used for many years for the treatment
of dermatophyte infections (31). Mechanistically, it inhibits
mitosis in sensitive fungi (32) and mammalian cells (33, 34) but
whether mitotic arrest is a consequence of microtubule depo-
lymerization or some other action on microtubules in both
fungi and human cells is still unclear (27, 28, 33, 35). Interest-
ingly, in a recent comparison of analogues in fungal and
mammalian cells we found that GF-15 was less active against
dermatophytes than griseofulvin (36). Although griseofulvin
has been reported to bind to mammalian brain tubulin and to
inhibit microtubule polymerization in vitro, it does so only at
concentrations signiﬁcantly higher than those needed for
spindle multipolarity induction in cancer cells (13, 35). Also,
whether griseofulvin binds to tubulin directly or to microtu-
bule-associated proteins remains unclear (27, 35, 37, 38). It was

reported more than 30 years ago that griseofulvin treatment
induces spindle multipolarity with each mitotic center con-
taining 2 centrioles in HeLa cells in the absence of signiﬁcant
spindle microtubule depolymerization (33). In accordance
with these ﬁndings, our data show that griseofulvin signiﬁ-
cantly inhibits polymerization of puriﬁed tubulin only at the
highest concentration tested (100 mmol/L), although induction

200 mitotic cells were counted for spindle polarity after staining for g-tubulin, Eg5, and 40, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. E, synchronized OPM2 cells arrest in

Raab et al.

of spindle multipolarity by griseofulvin occurred at an EC50
of 25 mmol/L in SCC114 cells. Similarly, GF-15 inhibits tubulin
polymerization only at concentrations of or above 25 mmol/L,
whereas the EC50 value for multipolar spindle induction was
900 nmol/L in SCC114 cells for this compound. These ﬁndings
suggest that induction of spindle multipolarity by griseofulvin
and its analog GF-15 is not sufﬁciently explained by their
inhibitory action on tubulin polymerization.

It has recently been shown that cells with supernumerary
centrosomes pass through a transient multipolar spindle
intermediate state before centrosome clustering and subse-
quent bipolar anaphase occur (14, 15). At low concentrations
GF-15 leads to multipolar metaphases with centrioles at each
pole in cells with extra centrioles. At higher concentrations
spindle multipolarity with acentrosomal spindle pole forma-
tion is induced. This is consistent with the concept that
clustering extra centrosomes in cancer cells might be mech-
anistically related to focusing microtubules into a bipolar
spindle array in normal cells. Analysis of GF-15-treated HeLa
cells conditionally overexpressing PLK4 revealed that spindle
multipolarity is carried on into anaphase/telophase with cen-
trioles at each pole in a substantial proportion of cells with
PLK4-induced centriole ampliﬁcation. Moreover, treatment
with GF-15 increased the death rates of HeLa cells after
induction of PLK4 expression, suggesting that GF-15 prefer-
entially kills cells with ampliﬁed centrioles.

Recent genome-wide RNAi screens in cells containing super-
numerary centrosomes suggest that only an intact spindle
assembly checkpoint allows for sufﬁcient time for centrosomal
clustering to occur and that spindle tension is necessary for
clustering of supernumerary centrosomes into a bipolar mitot-
ic spindle array (19, 20). Determination of spindle tension in
mitotic cells revealed that tension across sister kinetochores
was substantially reduced by GF-15 in both multipolar meta-
phase cells and metaphase cells that remained bipolar despite
treatment with GF-15. In addition to microtubule depolymer-
ization or stabilization at higher concentrations, most micro-
tubule-interacting drugs,
including griseofulvin, have been
proposed to exert their effects by suppressing microtubule
dynamics (35, 38). Interestingly, interference with microtubule
dynamics has been described to cause loss of spindle tension
across kinetochores (39, 40). Therefore, it is conceivable that
GF-15 inhibits microtubule dynamic instability with subse-
quent loss of spindle tension, centrosome declustering in cells
with supernumerary centrosomes, multipolar cell division, and
ultimately cell death.

For GF-15, the EC50 value for multipolar spindle induction in
vitro was 900 nmol/L in SCC114 cells, corresponding to a 27-
fold increased activity compared with griseofulvin itself. Also,
whereas griseofulvin inhibits cell proliferation only weakly
with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 25 mmol/L (13),
GF-15 led to inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro at IC50
values of 1 to 3 mmol/L, with almost no impact on the
viability of nonmalignant control cell lines. Similarly, although
3 mmol/L GF-15 effectively decreased the viability of primary
patient myeloma cells, the drug induced neither spindle mul-
tipolarity nor cell death in primary BMSCs or primary PBMCs
even after mitogenic stimulation. In vivo, GF-15 was well

tolerated and effective in mouse myeloma and colon cancer
xenograft models, as evidenced by signiﬁcant inhibition of
tumor growth, the induction of spindle multipolarity in tumor
xenograft cells and prolonged survival in mice treated with
either 20 or 100 mg/kg GF-15 intraperitoneally daily for 5 days a
week. Because GF-15 is only poorly soluble in water and its
biologic half-life is short with little drug left 1 hour after
administration, it is expected that optimization of medicinal
chemistry and application schedules will lead to a further
improvement of the drugs potency and of this novel thera-
peutic strategy in general.

In summary, we have shown that GF-15 potently inhibits
tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. From a mechanistic point
of view our data reveal that GF-15 reduces spindle tension,
possibly via inhibition of microtubule dynamic instability,
leading to spindle multipolarity in cells with supernumerary
centrosomes, similar to what has been described for the siRNA-
mediated depletion of several spindle and kinetochore com-
ponents (19, 20). These observations, coupled with GF-15's lack
of major toxicity in a preclinical mouse model and the lack of
signiﬁcant toxicity of griseofulvin in humans, provide the
framework for further clinical development of GF-15 in par-
ticular and centrosomal cluster inhibitors in general, directed
at improving patient outcome.
