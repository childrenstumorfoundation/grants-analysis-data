Latent tri-lineage potential of 
adult hippocampal neural stem 
cells revealed by Nf1 inactivation

Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult 
hippocampus are considered to be bi-potent, as they only 
produce neurons and astrocytes in vivo. In mouse, we found 
that inactivation of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1), a gene mutated in 
neurofibromatosis type 1, unlocked a latent oligodendrocyte 
lineage potential to produce all three lineages from NSCs  
in vivo. Our results suggest an avenue for promoting stem cell 
plasticity by targeting barriers of latent lineage potential. 

It had been long postulated that continuous neurogenesis in restricted 
regions  of  the  adult  mammalian  brain  originates  from  tri-potent 
NSCs1. Early supporting evidence includes in vivo observations of 
new neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the subventricular  
zone  (SVZ)  of  lateral  ventricles  and  hippocampal  dentate  gyrus, 
and in vitro demonstrations of tri-potency of individual adult NSCs  
following derivation and expansion2. However, recent population  
fate-mapping and clonal lineage-tracing of NSCs in the adult hip-
pocampus have consistently found the generation of neurons and 
astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes. In the adult SVZ, population 
fate-mapping studies have revealed the generation of both neurons 
and oligodendrocytes3, but in vivo clonal analysis has found only 
neuronal  lineages4,  and  in  vitro  time-lapse  analysis  revealed  that 
individual  acutely  isolated  NPCs  generate  either  neurons  or  oli-
godendrocytes, but never both5. Thus, whether NSCs with an intrinsic  
tri-lineage potential exist in the adult mammalian brain remains a 
fundamental question. How endogenous NSC lineage potential is 
regulated is also unknown. Incidentally, we discovered that condi-
tional inactivation of Nf1 in normally bi-potent radial glia-like NSCs 
(RGLs) in the adult dentate gyrus unlocked their latent oligodendro-
cytic lineage potential in vivo.

Mutations of Nf1 cause neurofibromatosis type 1, a disease that is 
characterized by increased risk of nervous system tumorigenesis and 
manifestation of specific learning disabilities6. NF1 regulates progenitor  
proliferation and fate specification6, yet its role in NSCs in the adult 
hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory, remains 
largely unknown. We used a tamoxifen-inducible NestinCreERT2 mouse 

line containing loxP-flanked (floxed) Nf1 exons 31 and 32 and a Z/EG 
reporter (NestinCreERT2; Nf1f/f; Z/EG; Nf1Nestin mice) with multiple 
tamoxifen injections (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), a model previously 
used to conditionally inactivate Nf1 and identify deficits in progeni-
tor proliferation and new neuron development in the adult hippoc-
ampus7.  The  total  numbers  of  labeled  neurons  that  we  observed 
1  month  post-tamoxifen  injection  (mpi)  in  Nf1Nestin  mice  were 
comparable to those in NestinCreERT2; Z/EG (controlNestin) animals  
(Fig. 1a,b). To our surprise, in Nf1Nestin animals, a large number of 
GFP+ cells exhibited oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) morphol-
ogy and expressed NG2, but not GFAP (Fig. 1c). The presence of GFP+ 
NG2+ MCM2+ cells indicated that active proliferation of RGL-derived 
OPCs contributed to their final production (Supplementary Fig. 1c). 
Consistent with previous studies8–12, OPCs were never observed in 
controlNestin animals (n = 3,564 cells) or NestinCreERT2; Nf1f/+; Z/EG 
mice (n = 2,568 cells; Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that biallelic 
Nf1 inactivation is required for OPC production. Notably, at 14 d post-
tamoxifen injection (dpi), Olig2 was expressed in 10 ± 3% (mean ± s.d.)  
of GFP+ RGLs in Nf1Nestin mice, but was not detected in controlNestin 
animals (n = 3 animals for each condition; Supplementary Fig. 1d), 
suggesting a potential molecular mechanism. Similar ectopic Olig2 
expression was found in the adult SVZ following Nf1 inactivation, 
which also leads to increased OPC production13. No difference in 
the  percentage  of  MCM2+  RGLs  following  Nf1  inactivation  was  
found at 2 or 14 dpi (n = 3 hemispheres for each condition, P ≥ 0.4, 
two-tailed unpaired t test).

Both Nf1 inactivation in OPCs and stress are known to induce OPC 
proliferation in vivo14,15. To rule out the possibility that rare OPCs 
were initially labeled and became amplified, we examined Nf1Nestin 
and controlNestin animals at 2 dpi. No GFP+ OPCs were observed 
across  the  hippocampus  (controlNestin,  n  =  1,734  cells;  Nf1Nestin,  
n = 669 cells; Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Table 1). Together, these 
data show de novo generation of the OPC lineage from adult NSCs 
that normally give rise to only neurons and astrocytes in vivo.

To ascertain the origin of new OPCs following Nf1 inactivation 
and assess properties of individual NSCs, we performed clonal lin-
eage-tracing of RGLs in the adult dentate gyrus (Supplementary  
Fig. 2a). Using a single low-dose tamoxifen injection in Nf1Nestin or 
controlNestin mice, we sparsely labeled, on average, 10 ± 1 precursors, 
including RGLs and very few intermediate neural progenitors, across 
the entire dentate gyrus at 2 dpi (n = 8 animals). No GFP+ OPCs were 
observed in any clones at 2 dpi (Nf1Nestin, 0 of 71 clones; controlNestin, 
0 of 50 clones; Supplementary Table 2). At 1 or 2 mpi, we observed 
Nf1Nestin clones that contained NG2+ cells with OPC morphology 
(6 of 142; Fig. 2a,b). Some clones contained astrocytes, OPCs and 
an RGL in close proximity (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 1);

other clones lacked RGLs, potentially as a result 
of RGL differentiation10 or death (Fig. 2b).  
Consistent with our previous characteriza-
tions of RGLs in multiple clonal lineage-tracing studies10–12 (over 504 
clones in total), we found no OPCs in any of the controlNestin clones  
(0 of 116; Supplementary Table 2). Some RGLs with four rounds of cell 
division still did not generate OPCs in controlNestin animals (Fig. 2c).  
Most Nf1Nestin clones (136 of 142) did not produce OPCs (Fig. 2d),  
which  could  have  been  a  result  of  incomplete  recombination  of 
reporter  and  both  Nf1  floxed  alleles  in  the  same  cell  following  a 
single low-dose tamoxifen induction, and/or Nf1 inactivation only 
unlocking the potential for, but not restricting, the RGL fate to OPCs, 
as shown in population fate mapping (Fig. 1). Notably, the size of

Nf1Nestin clones with OPCs was larger than those of controlNestin at 
1 mpi (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Consistent with a previous report7, 
some Nf1Nestin clones at 1 or 2 mpi contained mis-positioned labeled 
neurons, indicative of successful Nf1 inactivation in at least some of 
labeled clones. Notably, some neurons in Nf1Nestin clones migrated 
into  the  molecular  layer  (Supplementary  Fig.  2c),  suggesting  a  
critical role for NF1 in regulating the migration of newborn neurons 
during adult neurogenesis.

We validated our finding by clonal analysis using an independ-
ent tamoxifen-inducible Gli1CreERT2 line that also specifically targets 
RGLs in the adult dentate gyrus16. We gen-
erated  two  mouse  lines: Gli1CreERT2;  Nf1f/f;

Z/EG (Nf1Gli1) and Gli1CreERT2; Z/EG (controlGli1; Supplementary  
Fig. 3a). No GFP+ OPCs were observed at 2 dpi (Nf1Gli1, 0 of 20 clones; 
controlGli1, 0 of 34 clones; Supplementary Table 3). At 1 mpi, we 
observed OPC-containing clones in Nf1Gli1 animals (8 of 68 clones), 
but  never  in  controlGli1  animals  (0  of  38  clones;  Supplementary  
Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 3). Notably, some clones at 1 mpi 
in Nf1Gli1 animals contained three lineages: neurons, astrocytes and 
OPCs (3 of 68 clones; Supplementary Fig. 3b). Together, these results 
suggest  that  RGLs  in  the  adult  hippocampus  possess  an  intrinsic  
ability to generate all three major neural lineages, and the OPC lineage 
potential is actively restricted by NF1.

The concept of adult NSCs with a defining trait of multi-lineage 
neuronal, astrocytic and oligodendrocytic potential was established 
over  two  decades  ago1,  yet  no  endogenous  tri-potent  NSCs  have 
been  shown.  In  the  current  model,  NSCs  are  gradually  specified 
during development and become restricted in their lineage poten-
tial in adult17; they can only regain the tri-potentiality in vitro after 
removal from their local environment and treatment with growth 
factors. Our results suggest a new model in which adult NSCs are 
intrinsically tri-potent and their fate specification is regulated not 
only by positive instructive cues, but also by inhibitory signaling that 
actively suppresses certain fates (Supplementary Fig. 4). As NF1, 
a cytoplasmic regulator of Ras and cAMP signaling6, is neither a 
transcription factor nor a known direct reprogramming factor, our 
model is conceptually different from reprogramming, for example, 
in the case of a neuronal to oligodendrocytic fate switch following 
forced  Ascl1  overexpression  in  proliferating  hippocampal  neural  
progenitors18. Nf1 inactivation does not convert RGLs to OPCs, as 
other fates are still produced. Instead, our result supports an emerg-
ing view that latent lineage potentials could be actively suppressed in 
precursors or even in apparently differentiated cell types. For example,  
adult striatal astrocytes were recently shown to exhibit a latent neu-
rogenic  program  that  is  actively  suppressed  by  Notch  signaling19 
and can be elicited by injury20. This new framework enriches our  
understanding  of  fundamental  stem  cell  biology  and  opens  new  
avenues for stem cell plasticity or therapeutics via targeting barriers 
of a cell’s intrinsic lineage potential.

Animals  and  tamoxifen  administration.  NestinCreERT2;  Nf1 f/f;  Z/EG f/−, 
NestinCreERT2; Nf1f/+; Z/EG f/−, and NestinCreERT2; Z/EG f/− mice were generated 
by  crossing  NestinCreERT2  driver21  with  Z/EGf/−  reporter22  (Tg(CAG-Bgeo/
GFP)21Lbe/J, Jackson Labs) and Nf1f/f mice23, where applicable. Gli1CreERT2;  
Nf1 f/f; Z/EG f/− and Gli1CreERT2; Z/EG f/− mice were generated in a similar fash-
ion, but with Gli1CreERT2 mice16. All mice in the study were backcrossed to the 
C57BL/6 background for at least six generations. Animals were housed in a 14-h  
light/10-h  dark  cycle  and  had  free  access  to  food  and  water.  Tamoxifen  
(66.67 mg/ml, Sigma, T5648) was prepared in a 5:1 corn oil (Sigma) to etha-
nol mixture. As a result of differences in CreERT2 mouse generation, different 
tamoxifen injection procedures were required to enable sparse labeling for clonal 
analysis (~8–16 clones per hemisphere). A single 62.5 mg per kg of body weight 
dose of tamoxifen (for NestinCreERT2) or a 125 mg per kg dose every 12 h for 4 
total doses (for Gli1CreERT2) was intraperitoneally injected into adult 8–10 week-
old male and female mice (Supplementary Table 4). For population cell labeling 
in NestinCreERT2, animals were injected with 125 mg per kg every 12 h 4 times 
(Supplementary Table 4). Animals were analyzed at 2 dpi, 14 dpi, or 1-2 mpi.  
For animals with multiple injections, dpi and mpi were counted starting from the 
final injection. All animal procedures were performed in accordance to institu-
tional guidelines of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Tissue processing, immunostaining and confocal imaging. Animals were tran-
scardially perfused with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol, in 0.1 M phosphate  
buffer,  PB,  pH  7.4),  and  cryoprotected  with  30%  sucrose  (wt/vol).  Serial  
40-µm-thick  coronal  brain  sections  were  cut  on  a  frozen  sliding  micro-
tome  (Leica,  SM2010R)  for  immunohistology  as  previously  described10,24. 
Antibodies diluted in TBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 (vol/vol) and 3% donkey  
serum  (vol/vol),  were  used  against  GFP  (Aves  Labs,  GFP-1020,  chicken, 
1:500;  Rockland,  600-101-215,  goat,  1:500;  AbD  Serotec,  4745-1051,  sheep, 
1:500),  Tbr2  (Abcam,  ab23345,  rabbit,  1:250),  GFAP  (Millipore,  MAB360, 
mouse, 1:1,000; DAKO, Z033401-2, rabbit, 1:1,000), Nestin (Aves Labs, NES, 
chicken, 1:500), Prox1 (Millipore, MAB5654, mouse, 1:500), NG2 (Millipore, 
AB5320, rabbit, 1:200), Olig2 (a generous gift from B. Novitch (University of 
California, Los Angeles), guinea pig, 1:20,000). Nestin antigen was retrieved 
by incubating brain sections in 1× DAKO target retrieval solution (DAKO) 
at  68  °C  for  20  min,  followed  by  10  min  cooling  to  at  20  °C.  Serial  sec-
tions from the entire dentate gyrus were first immunostained for GFP to allow  

identification of prospective clone-containing  sections  on  an  epifluorescence  
microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 200M). Labeled clone-containing sections were 
taken  for  further  processing  and  confocal  imaging  at  40×  on  a  Zeiss  LSM  
710 confocal microscope using multi-track or spectral linear unmixing ‘online 
fingerprinting’ configurations (Carl Zeiss).

Image processing and data analyses. For population cell labeling experiments, 
cells were counted manually by visualizing the serial dentate gyrus sections on an 
epifluorescence microscope. Due to the difficulty in reliably quantifying small, 
densely packed transient-amplifying neural progenitors, only cells with mature 
neuron morphology were counted as belonging to the neuronal lineage at 1 mpi.  
For  clonal  cell  labeling  experiments,  identification  of  clones  amongst  GFP-
labeled clusters of cells was performed as previously described10,25. Clones that 
spanned multiple serial sections were reconstructed using Reconstruct software 
as previously described10,25. All aligned images were exported at full resolution 
for three-dimensional visualization into Imaris (Bitplane) and analyzed. All 
other confocal images were directly visualized and analyzed in Imaris. Movie of 
three-dimensional–rendered clone was generated using the Animation feature 
in Imaris. Clones were analyzed in a dentate gyrus volume that included the 
molecular layer, granule cell layer, subgranular zone, and hilus, excluding the 
polymorphic layer (CA4) protruding into the posterior dentate gyrus. Clonal 
cell fate frequencies were calculated per brain hemisphere and averaged across 
hemispheres. Numbers of cells and animals counted and used, respectively, are 
shown in Supplementary Tables 1–3. No statistical methods were used to pre-
determine sample sizes; sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous 
studies10,11 Due to the binary nature of the reported phenomenon, randomi-
zation and blinding were not employed. A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test was used to statistically compare clone cell number distributions. A two- 
sample unpaired Student’s t test was used to statistically compare the percentage 
of MCM2+ RGLs upon Nf1 inactivation at 2 or 14 dpi.
