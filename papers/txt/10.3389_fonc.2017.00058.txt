Mitochondria can receive, integrate, and transmit a variety of signals to shape many 
biochemical activities of the cell. In the process of tumor onset and growth, mitochon-
dria  contribute  to  the  capability  of  cells  of  escaping  death  insults,  handling  changes 
in  ROS  levels,  rewiring  metabolism,  and  reprograming  gene  expression.  Therefore, 
mitochondria can tune the bioenergetic and anabolic needs of neoplastic cells in a rapid 
and flexible way, and these adaptations are required for cell survival and proliferation in 
the fluctuating environment of a rapidly growing tumor mass. The molecular bases of 
pro-neoplastic  mitochondrial  adaptations  are  complex  and  only  partially  understood. 
Recently, the mitochondrial molecular chaperone TRAP1 (tumor necrosis factor recep-
tor associated protein 1) was identified as a key regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics 
in tumor cells, with a profound impact on neoplastic growth. In this review, we analyze 
these findings and discuss the possibility that targeting TRAP1 constitutes a new anti-
tumor approach.

Mitochondria take part actively in the process of neoplastic transformation as critical components in 
the regulation of cell survival, redox equilibrium, autophagy, and core metabolic pathways (Figure 1) 
(1). Changes in each of these biological routines are required for cell progression to malignancy, 
allowing to escape death signals, to cope with oxidative stress, and to meet energy demands for 
growth and proliferation in an environment where nutrient and oxygen can be spatially and tempo-
rally heterogeneous (2–4). The profound metabolic rewiring of tumor cells is driven by alterations 
in multiple signaling pathways that deeply intertwine mitochondrial changes with rearrangements 
occurring in other cellular compartments. These pathways are mastered by activation of oncogenes 
such as Ras or Myc (5, 6), induction of transcription factors such as HIF1α (7), and inactivation 
of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 (8, 9). In most tumor cell types, this leads to enhanced 
glucose utilization paralleled by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) irrespective 
of oxygen availability, a rearrangement also known as aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect (10–12). 
Induction of pathways that branch from glycolysis, including the pentose phosphate pathway (13) 
or amino acid biosynthetic pathways (14, 15) also affords high levels of anabolic intermediates, 
whereas the increased activity of ROS scavenging systems shields tumor cells from potentially lethal 
oxidative insults (16,  17), and acidification of the extracellular microenvironment increases the

FiguRe 1 | Mitochondria and cancer. Mitochondria play a crucial role in several biological routines involved in tumorigenesis (1): control of ROS levels, whose 
increase can lead to DNA mutations and genomic instability; autophagy regulation; resistance to cell death stimuli; metabolic changes, such as decreased oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and induction of anabolic pathways; dysregulation of transduction pathways, including kinase signaling and changes in oncometabolite 
levels that modulate transcription factors and epigenetic changes.

activity of several pro-invasive factors (18,  19). To fulfill their 
anabolic needs, tumor cells also stimulate lipid biosynthesis (20) 
and increase the usage of glutamine as an anaplerotic mechanism 
to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and to provide nitrogen 
and carbon (21). As a result, the neoplastic cell proliferates even 
in the core of an expanding tumor mass, where it can face short-
ages of blood supply leading to hypoxia, paucity of nutrients, and 
oscillations of redox conditions (2, 10, 22).

In  this  complex  scenario,  mitochondria  are  not  only  the 
effector  devices  of  the  bioenergetic  adaptations  of  tumor  cells, 
but also active inducers of their metabolic rewiring. For instance, 
inactivating  mutations  in  genes  encoding  respiratory  complex 
subunits have been associated with a wide range of cancer types 
(23–25). However, the neoplastic role played by these mutations 

is unclear, as most cancer cells are able to generate ATP through 
a competent OXPHOS (26). Thus, more subtle molecular mecha-
nisms might be responsible for mitochondrial changes in cancer 
cells.  One  example  is  provided  by  the  increase  in  intracellular 
levels  of  oncometabolites,  i.e.,  metabolic  intermediates  whose 
accumulation can drive pro-neoplastic programs (27, 28). Loss-
of-function mutations in the TCA cycle enzymes succinate dehy-
drogenase (SDH) or fumarate hydratase, cause the accumulation 
of succinate or fumarate, respectively, leading to the onset of a 
specific subset of tumors, including paraganglioma, pheochro-
mocytoma and renal cell carcinoma (29). In addition, gain-of-
function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) cause the 
accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which plays an important 
role  in  glioma,  acute  myeloid  leukemia,  chondrosarcoma  and

cholangiocarcinoma  (28).  The  pro-neoplastic  activity  of  these 
oncometabolites is complex and probably not entirely understood 
yet (27), spanning from induction of transcription factors such 
as HIF1α (25, 29) to epigenetic modifications (30) and miRNA 
regulation leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and 
invasiveness (31).

In addition to the conceptual interest and to the mechanistic 
insights  provided  by  the  work  on  oncometabolite  functions, 
these  observations  highlight  the  importance  of  mitochondria-
driven  tuning  of  metabolic  features  in  neoplastic  cells.  It  is 
conceivable to envision that mitochondrial metabolic rearrange-
ments are complex and highly dynamic process on the route to 
tumor onset and growth, which might require fast and flexible 
adaptations  to  environmental  changes  well  beyond  mutations 
targeting components of the bioenergetic circuitries. Therefore, 
components of the mitochondrial metabolic machinery might 
be rapidly regulated during tumorigenesis, for instance, by post-
transcriptional  modifications  such  as  phosphorylation  events 
or chaperone-mediated tuning of their activity. In this review, 
we  analyze  how  one  of  these  components,  the  mitochondrial 
chaperone  TRAP1,  contributes  to  the  neoplastic  process  and 
how  TRAP1  targeting  might  be  a  new  promising  therapeutic 
approach for cancer treatment.

THe MOLeCuLAR CHAPeRONe TRAP1

In the last few years, several observations have pointed toward 
an important role played by TRAP1 in the adaptive metabolic 
changes of tumor cell mitochondria. TRAP1 was first identified 
as an interactor of the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (32) 
and later as heat shock protein 75 (HSP75) (33). It is a molecular 
chaperone of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) family, as TRAP1 
and HSP90 display 34% identity and 60% homology at the mRNA 
level and share the same domain organization (34). The TRAP1 
cognate  HSP90  is  crucial  in  maturation,  activation,  and  stabi-
lization of a large set of proteins, including components of cell 
cycle, apoptosis, and motility programs, whose deregulation is 
crucial in tumorigenesis (35, 36). Therefore, HSP90 has emerged 
as a promising target for development of anticancer drugs (37). 
In more recent years, the observation that TRAP1 expression is 
induced in several tumor types (38), together with its similarity 
with HSP90, have sparked interest in better understanding the 
mode of action and the potential role(s) in the neoplastic process 
played by this mitochondrial chaperone.

A TRAP(1) for Keeping Clients in Shape
TRAP1 expression seems to be mainly restricted to mitochondria 
(1). Indeed, TRAP1 is the only HSP90-family member that con-
tains a 59-amino acid, N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence 
that  is  removed  upon  organelle  import  (34).  TRAP1  acts  as  a 
homodimer that utilizes ATP to carry out its chaperone activity. 
Each of the two protomers is formed by three major domains: the 
N-terminal domain, responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis; 
the C-terminal domain (CTD) that provides a dimerization inter-
face between protomers; and the middle domain (M-domain) that 
completes the ATP-pocket and contains the recognition surface 
for the chaperone substrates, called clients. Thus, the M-domain 

directly couples ATP binding and hydrolysis with client remod-
eling (39). Unlike other eukaryotic HSP90 paralogs, TRAP1 lacks 
the charged linker between the middle and C-terminal domains 
and  features  a  long  extension  of  the  N-terminal  β-strand  (the 
so-called “strap”) that crosses between protomers in the closed 
state and acts as a thermal regulator of protein function, inhibit-
ing it at low temperatures. However, the most distinctive trait of 
TRAP1 is the presence of a marked asymmetric conformation, as 
one protomer is reconfigured via a helix swap at the middle:C-
terminal domain (M-domain:CTD) interface (40).

The ATPase cycle of TRAP1 has been investigated in detail 
(39, 41, 42) allowing to establish a model for its conformational 
cycle.  Both  TRAP1  protomers  undergo  concerted  structural 
changes through rounds of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release 
(39, 42), although it is unknown how ATP hydrolysis is coupled 
to client maturation. During the ATPase cycle, TRAP1 can adopt 
three  distinct  states  (Figure  2):  an  open  conformation,  called 
the apo state; a closed conformation with an N-terminal strap/
extension straddled between both protomers and a coiled-coil, 
intermediate  conformation  with  the  N-terminal  domains  in 
close physical proximity (40, 42). ATP binding induces a dra-
matic structural change in the chaperone configuration leading 
to the formation of a closed asymmetric conformation (39, 43). 

FiguRe 2 | Schematic representation of the of the TRAP1 
conformational cycle. TRAP1 protomers are shown in different hues and 
colored orange [ADP-bound or naked N-terminal domain (NTD)], red 
(ATP-bound NTD), blue [middle domain (MD)], and green [C-terminal domain 
(CTD)]. In the absence of bound nucleotides (apo state), TRAP1 populates a 
number of states with open conformations. Upon ATP binding, the 
chaperone shifts to an asymmetric closed conformation with significant 
strain, leading to buckling of the MD:CTD interface. After hydrolysis of the 
first ATP, strain is relieved and the MD:CTD interface is rearranged, forming a 
symmetric state. Hydrolysis of the second ATP leads to the formation of the 
ADP state. The cycle eventually returns to the open conformation after ADP 
release (39–42).

The subsequent ATP hydrolysis gives off the energy required for 
client remodeling and is performed in a two-step process (39). 
The hydrolysis of the first ATP causes changes in protomer sym-
metry that lead to the rearrangement of the client-binding site, 
which in turn is coupled to structural changes in the client con-
formation. The second ATP is used to induce the formation of a 
compact ADP state of the chaperone, which releases the client 
and eventually the ADP molecules. So far the number of known 
clients of TRAP1 is quite small (38) and TRAP1 co-chaperones, 
i.e., proteins that assist and regulate the chaperone cycle, have 
yet to be identified.
TRAP1 Functions: Mitochondrial 
Homeostasis
A detailed analysis of the tissue expression profile of TRAP1 is 
lacking and little is known on its physiological functions. Early 
experiments  have  shown  that  TRAP1  displays  an  anti-oxidant 
activity.  Indeed,  reduced  TRAP1  expression  corresponds  to 
increased ROS levels and enhanced susceptibility to cell death 
upon  oxidative  stress,  whereas  exposure  to  sublethal  doses  of 
oxidants increases TRAP1 protein levels (44–47). This involve-
ment of TRAP1 in mitochondrial redox control has been linked 
to  the  pathogenesis  of  several  disorders,  among  which  there 
are the Parkinson’s disease (PD) and ischemic damage. In PD, 
redox unbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction play key roles 
(48). TRAP1 could protect mitochondria by reversing cytotox-
icity  mediated  either  by  α-synuclein,  whose  accumulation  is 
pathogenic in PD (49) or by alterations in the Parkin/PINK1 axis, 
which controls mitochondrial homeostasis (50, 51). In ischemia, 
the antioxidant activity of TRAP1 could decrease mitochondrial 
dysfunction, thus reducing damage both in brain (52) and in heart 
(53, 54). These observations, together with reports of a TRAP1 
involvement in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics (55) 
and mitophagy (50, 51) have led to the hypothesis that TRAP1 
would have an important role in maintenance of mitochondrial 
homeostasis  under  specific  stress  or  pathological  conditions, 
including  those  encountered  by  cells  during  the  deregulated 
growth of a tumor mass.

In  spite  of  these  protective  functions  exerted  by  TRAP1, 
its  overexpression  in  transgenic  mice  leads  to  fatty  liver  and 
increased  inflammation  after  partial  hepatectomy  (PH)  (56). 
Indeed,  PH  is  a  stress  factor  that  boosts  proliferation  and 
profound metabolic changes in hepatocytes, which is somehow 
reminiscent of neoplastic growth, but expression levels of TRAP1 
do not change after PH in wild-type animals (57). Therefore, the 
importance of TRAP1 in responding to stress conditions and its 
modes of regulation are probably context dependent, a concept 
that  could  be  crucial  for  understanding  TRAP1  functions  in 
tumorigenesis.

A MeTABOLiC TRAP iN CANCeR

TRAP1 expression is higher in many tumors compared to sur-
rounding non-malignant tissues (1, 38). Elevation of TRAP1 
protein  levels  correlates  with  malignant  progression  and 
metastasis in several neoplastic models, including prostate and 
breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal 

carcinoma (57–61), and with disease recurrence in non-small 
cell lung cancer (62). Hence, in these malignancies, TRAP1 is a 
candidate biomarker for cancer progression and for prognosis 
outcome. These studies open the possibility that TRAP1 activ-
ity  could  in  some  way  favor  neoplastic  growth,  in  line  with 
observations that levels of several chaperones increase in a wide 
range of cancer types, where they contribute to uncontrolled 
growth, enhanced survival, and acquisition of angiogenic and 
metastatic potential (63). Understanding whether TRAP1 has 
any tumorigenic role could help in elucidating how mitochon-
dria can contribute to the neoplastic process and could possibly 
pave the way for novel antitumor strategies.
TRAP1 and the warburg Phenotype: For 
Many but Not for All
In  the  last  few  years,  several  reports  have  demonstrated  that 
TRAP1 is involved in the metabolic regulation of tumor cells. The 
first suggestion came with the observation that mitochondrial 
HSP90 proteins, including TRAP1, maintain energy homeosta-
sis  in  transformed  cells  by  inhibiting  nutrient-sensing  AMP-
activated kinase, autophagy, and unfolded protein response of 
the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (64).  These  authors  proposed  that 
the  effect  of  TRAP1  activity  on  cell  metabolism  was  that  of 
maintaining proteostasis, i.e., organelle integrity and energy con-
servation. In particular, under stress conditions TRAP1 would 
impede ATP depletion and the consequent autophagy induction. 
A more mechanistic comprehension of TRAP1 metabolic func-
tions has been achieved when two different groups have reported 
that TRAP1 contributes to the switch toward aerobic glycolysis, 
i.e., decreased OXPHOS activity together with enhanced glucose 
utilization. They demonstrated that TRAP1 deficiency increases 
fatty acid oxidation and accumulation of TCA intermediates in 
neoplastic cells (65, 66), and that TRAP1 inhibited mitochon-
drial  respiration  by  two  different  but  not  mutually  exclusive 
molecular  mechanisms  (Figure  3).  On  the  one  hand,  TRAP1 
inhibits OXPHOS via downregulation of cytochrome oxidase, 
the  complex  IV  of  the  respiratory  chain  (66).  On  the  other 
hand, TRAP1 inhibits SDH, a metabolic enzyme that is both the 
complex II of the respiratory chain and a component of the TCA 
cycle (65). This observation supports a model whereby TRAP1 
has an important oncogenic activity. Indeed, TRAP1-dependent 
inhibition of SDH leads to the consequent increase in intracel-
lular succinate levels, which in turn stabilizes the transcription 
factor  HIF1α,  as  already  postulated  (67).  The  transcriptional 
program mastered by HIF1α stimulates invasiveness of tumor 
cells together with their angiogenic potential and further ampli-
fies their metabolic rewiring (7, 68), and succinate-dependent 
HIF1α induction turned out to be essential for the neoplastic 
growth of several tumor cells (65).

TRAP1 might also contribute to tumor cell survival under con-
ditions of stress normally encountered during neoplastic growth, 
such as exposure to redox disequilibria or nutrient shortage. In 
these conditions, TRAP1 both inhibits the permeability transi-
tion pore (PTP) (70, 73), a mitochondrial channel whose opening 
leads to cell death (71), and maintains proteostasis by blocking 
autophagy,  as  mentioned  (64).  In  accord  with  the  importance 
of TRAP1 induction along tumor progression, we have recently

FiguRe 3 | TRAP1 activity in tumor cell mitochondria. (A) TRAP1 inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by interacting with both succinate 
dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome oxidase, aka complex II and complex IV of the respiratory chain, respectively. SDH inhibition is enhanced by ERK1/2-
dependent phosphorylation of TRAP1 and leads to succinate-dependent stabilization of the transcription factor HIF1α, which masters several pro-neoplastic 
programs (65, 69). Downregulation of cytochrome oxidase activity relies upon the inhibitory interaction between TRAP1 and Src (66). (B) TRAP1 inhibits ROS 
generation by SDH and cytochrome oxidase (66, 70). This, together with the interaction with other chaperones, such as cyclophilin D (CyP-D) and heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90), inhibits opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), which requires conformational changes of the ATP synthase and leads to cell death 
(71, 72). Therefore, TRAP1 protects tumor cells from cell death stimuli.

observed that its protein levels are markedly increased in very 
early, pre-neoplastic foci in a model of liver carcinogenesis. In 
this setting, the enhancement of TRAP1 expression is restricted 
to lesions that progress to malignancy, where it associates with 
a marked SDH inhibition that can be reverted by HSP90-family 
inhibitors (57).

TRAP1 and Redox Homeostasis: 
Chaperoning Controversies on ROS in 
Cancer
The metabolic regulations exerted by TRAP1 could explain its 
anti-oxidant activity. Mitochondrial respiration is responsible for 
the generation of a large fraction of cellular ROS (74) and inhibi-
tion  of  respiratory  complexes  by  TRAP1  downregulates  ROS 
levels (66, 70). Thus, TRAP1 relevance in tumorigenesis might 
also stem from its function of oxidant shield (Figure 3). However, 
the interplay between redox status and malignancy of cells is a 
multifaceted  one  (16,  17).  Therefore,  the  effects  of  TRAP1  on 
the neoplastic process could be complex, possibly depending on 
the tumor type and stage. Indeed, neoplastic cells have to cope 
with  increased  steady-state  accumulation  of  ROS  and  with  a 
quickly changing redox equilibrium, making them vulnerable to 
oxidative stress. This could rapidly become lethal, for instance, by 
inducing PTP opening (75).

In tumor cell mitochondria, TRAP1 could be part of a chap-
erone network involving HSP90, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), 
and cyclophilin D (CyP-D) (73, 76), one of the best characterized 
proteinaceous PTP inducers (72). TRAP1 function in this com-
plex would be to antagonize PTP opening (73). Therefore, these 
observations  were  a  first  clue  to  decipher  the  mechanisms  by 
which TRAP1 protects cells from oxidants and contributes to the 

resistance to cell death stimuli that hallmarks cancer cells (77). It 
is reasonable to envisage that TRAP1 could inhibit mitochondrial 
PTP opening independently of a direct interaction with chan-
nel components or regulators. In line with this hypothesis, we 
have recently shown that TRAP1 limits ROS generation by SDH, 
aka the complex II of the respiratory chain, thus increasing the 
threshold for PTP opening in cancer cells and protecting them 
from death stimuli (70). Handling of oxidative stress might be 
extremely important at the beginning of tumorigenesis, to avoid 
that a deregulated ROS increase becomes detrimental for viability 
of cells in which adequate antioxidant defenses are not yet fully 
established.  Accordingly,  in  the  hepatocarcinogenesis  model 
in which TRAP1 levels are induced from the very early stages, 
malignant cells build up an anti-oxidant program mastered by 
the transcription factor Nrf2, which also affects TRAP1 expres-
sion (57). Hence, in this tumor type a strong correlation exists 
among early TRAP1 induction, Warburg-like metabolic rewiring 
and protection from oxidative insults, and these adaptations are 
required for neoplastic progression to malignancy.

However,  a  ROS  surge  could  favor  tumor  growth,  as  it 
damages nucleic acids and leads to genetic instability, a crucial 
adaptive  strategy  for  increasing  malignancy  that  could  be 
particularly  gainful  for  advanced  neoplasms  (78).  Therefore, 
the anti-oxidant effect of TRAP1 could hamper neoplastic pro-
gression in specific tumor types or stages. Accordingly, TRAP1 
expression levels inversely correlate with tumor grade in cervical 
carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (66), and high-grade 
ovarian cancer (79).

Changes in redox equilibrium are also involved in the regula-
tion of cell invasiveness. Again, contradictory reports show that 
the  absence  of  TRAP1  favors  in  vitro  cell  invasiveness  (80) 
through an increase in ROS levels (66) and that cell motility and

invasion of prostate cancer and glioblastoma cells are promoted 
by  TRAP1  in  conditions  of  limited  nutrient  availability  (81). 
Moreover, the anti-oxidant activity of TRAP1 could contribute 
to cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutics that elicit oxida-
tive stress, especially in colorectal and breast cancer models (47, 
82, 83). Accordingly, TRAP1 interaction with the Ca2+-binding 
protein Sorcin was reported to enhance both the stability of the 
chaperone and resistance of tumor cells to antineoplastic com-
pounds (84).

TRAP1 and Post-Translational 
Modifications (PTMs): Mitochondrial 
Signaling in and Signaling Out
Chaperone activity is required to face a variety of cellular stresses, 
in order to avoid damage by maintaining protein stability and 
function, thus ensuring cell survival (85). Therefore, many chap-
erones have many layers of regulation, both at the transcriptional 
and at the protein level.

Several  lines  of  evidence  indicate  that  TRAP1  is  target  of 
several PTMs that could influence its stability and activity under 
conditions of cellular stress. A first clue to understand this kind 
of regulatory events came with the demonstration that TRAP1 
is a phosphorylation target of PINK1, a Ser/Thr kinase that can 
associate  to  mitochondria.  PINK1-dependent  phosphorylation 
leads to an increase in TRAP1 anti-oxidant function (86), even 
if the relevance of this PTM in tumorigenesis remains unknown. 
TRAP1 is also Tyr-phosphorylated and this is abrogated by the 
c-Src  inhibitor  dasatinib,  strongly  suggesting  that  TRAP1  is  a 
target of the mitochondrial fraction of c-Src (Figure 3) (66). The 
interaction between TRAP1 and c-Src would inhibit the kinase, 
in turn leading to inhibition of the complex IV of the respiratory 
chain,  a  c-Src  phosphorylation  target  (87).  Interestingly,  Tyr 
kinases  of  the  Src  family  are  activated  upon  oxidative  stress 
and  can  integrate  mitochondrial  redox  signaling  pathways 
(88–90). By inhibiting a respiratory complex via c-Src inhibition, 
TRAP1  would  keep  ROS  levels  low,  whereas  knocking-down 
TRAP1  expression  would  stimulate  ROS-dependent  migration 
and invasion of tumor cells in vitro, again suggesting the pos-
sibility  that  the  impact  of  TRAP1  on  tumorigenicity  might  be 
context-dependent.

These  reports  open  the  reasonable  perspective  that  TRAP1 
PTMs could be crucial in tuning metabolic adaptations of tumor 
cells. Further hints were provided by recent observations that link 
TRAP1 phosphorylations to Ras/ERK signaling, a kinase trans-
duction pathway whose hyperactivation has a pivotal importance 
in a variety of tumor types (91, 92). TRAP1 phosphorylation by 
BRAF, the first Ser/Thr kinase activated downstream to Ras, was 
associated with resistance to apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma 
models  (93).  More  mechanistic  details  came  with  our  recent 
observation that TRAP1 is phosphorylated in an ERK-dependent 
way on two Ser residues, Ser511 and Ser568 of the human protein 
(69). We found that cells endowed with deregulated induction of 
the Ras/ERK1/2 signaling pathway have a metabolic switch toward 
aerobic glycolysis that is regulated by a fraction of active ERK1/2 
located into mitochondria. Mitochondrial ERK1/2 forms a multi-
meric complex with TRAP1 and SDH in which the chaperone and 

the kinase display a reciprocal interaction. ERK1/2 phosphoryl-
ates TRAP1, thus stimulating TRAP1 inhibition of SDH activity 
and  crucially  contributing  to  cell  metabolic  rewiring.  In  turn, 
TRAP1 stabilizes mitochondrial ERK1/2, maintaining the kinase 
active  even  under  stress  conditions  (69).  These  observations 
were made on cells where the Ras/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is 
deregulated following loss of the Ras GTPase-activating protein 
neurofibromin, encoded by the NF1 gene. Biallelic inactivation 
at the NF1 locus is one of the most frequent cancer-associated 
mutations in a wide array of tumor types and characterizes the 
tumor-predisposing  genetic  syndrome  neurofibromatosis  type 
1  (94).  Abrogation  of  TRAP1  expression  completely  ablates 
tumorigenicity  in  cells  lacking  neurofibromin  (69).  Therefore, 
we propose that hyperactivation of a Ras/ERK/TRAP1 signaling 
axis might be an oncogenic determinant in a large spectrum of 
neoplastic cells by switching their metabolism toward an aerobic 
glycolysis phenotype.

Reversible  cysteine  S-nitrosylation  is  a  redox-based  PTM 
consequent to nitric oxide bioreactivity (95). TRAP1 cysteine 501 
residue is S-nitrosylated in HCC cells, as highlighted in cells lack-
ing S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). GSNOR regulates 
the  levels  of  proteins  undergoing  S-nitrosylation  by  catalyzing 
S-nitrosoglutathione  reduction  (96),  and  its  deficiency  has 
been observed in certain models of hepatocarcinogenesis (97). 
S-nitrosylation of TRAP1 primes it for proteasomal degradation. 
As a consequence, SDH levels and activity rise in HCC cells (98), 
further confirming the inhibitory role of TRAP1 on SDH and the 
complexity of metabolic adaptations occurring in the process of 
neoplastic progression.

Taken  together,  these  observations  indicate  that  PTMs  of 
TRAP1 can be a way by which deregulated transduction pathways 
funnel signals to the mitochondrial bioenergetic machinery, finely 
tuning its activity during tumor progression in accordance with 
the metabolic needs of cells. Notably, this bioenergetic regulation 
contributes to retrograde signaling, as SDH inhibition by TRAP1 
impacts  on  the  nuclear  transcriptional  profile  of  cancer  cells 
through succinate-mediated HIF1α stabilization, thus promoting 
cancer growth (65). Therefore, TRAP1 might have a central role 
in shaping inward- and outward-moving mitochondrial signals 
in cancer cells and in setting the metabolic adaptations they need 
to thrive.

TARgeTiNg TRAP1 AS A STRATegY FOR 
CANCeR TReATMeNT

Considering  the  above  observations,  it  is  reasonable  to  envis-
age  that  TRAP1  is  a  good  target  to  develop  novel  therapeutic 
approaches  for  cancer  treatment.  So  far,  the  strategy  used  to 
inhibit its chaperone activity has been to exploit molecules already 
used as HSP90 blockers. These compounds inhibit ATP binding 
at the HSP90 N-terminal domain (Figure 4) (99, 100) and are 
active on TRAP1 too, given the high similarity of its ATP-binding 
pocket with that of HSP90. The approach developed to increase 
the selectivity of these compounds for TRAP1 has been to link 
them to moieties that facilitate permeability across mitochondrial 
membranes and accumulation in the organelle.

FiguRe 4 | TRAP1 inhibition by small molecules. TRAP1 inhibitors can 
act either at the level of the ATP-binding pocket (the yellow portion of the two 
protomers), with the aim of blocking ATP hydrolysis, or at an allosteric 
druggable site, in analogy with heat shock protein 90 (101, 102). In red, it is 
represented a potential target of allosteric inhibitors at the middle domain:C-
terminal domain interface.

Targeting HSP90-Family Chaperones in 
Mitochondria: Moving Toward Organelle-
Specific inhibitors
The  first  designed  molecule  that  has  shown  ability  to  enter 
mitochondria and target the mitochondrial pool of HSP90s has 
been shepherdin, a synthetic peptidomimetic inhibitor of HSP90 
ATPase  activity  (103).  To  accumulate  inside  mitochondria, 
shepherdin utilizes a highly positive charged Antennapedia cell-
penetrating moiety fused at its amino terminus (104). Shepherdin 
prompts apoptosis probably via PTP opening, as it induces cell 
death in a CyP-D-dependent manner, causing organelle swelling 
and depolarization and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. 
Shepherdin has shown efficacy against tumor cells both in vitro 
and in xenograft models, but it exhibits some serious limitations 
for drug development, such as a low half-life due to degradation 
in the plasma by esterases and capability to induce an immune 
response (105, 106). It also modulates the expression of a number 
of cytosolic HSP90 client proteins (103), suggesting that its activ-
ity is not restricted to mitochondria and could have unpredictable 
off-target effects in non-transformed cells. To circumvent these 
limitations,  another  class  of  mitochondrial  HSP90  inhibitors 
has  been  designed  by  attaching  either  triphenylphosphonium 
(TPP) or 1–4 units of cyclic guanidinium to the HSP90 blocker 
geldanamycin,  to  make  it  organelle-permeable  (101).  At  high 
concentration  these  compounds,  dubbed  gamitrinib-TPP  and 
gamitrinib-G1–4, induce an irreversible collapse of mitochondrial 
functions, cause PTP opening and elicit death in cancer cell lines, 

while affecting growth in xenograft tumor models (101, 105, 106). 
Nonetheless, some critical issues must be resolved, such as com-
pound formulation (like their parent molecules, gamitrinibs are 
water insoluble), dosing, tolerability, and potential side effects on 
tissues characterized by high levels of mitochondrial respiration. 
Recently, another putative TRAP1 inhibitor, named SMTIN-P01, 
was  obtained  by  replacing  the  isopropyl  amine  of  the  HSP90 
inhibitor PU-H71 with the mitochondria-permeant moiety TPP. 
SMTIN-P01  induces  mitochondrial  membrane  depolarization 
and shows a slightly improved cytotoxicity over gamitrinibs in 
some tumor cell lines, but it has not been tested yet in xenograft 
models (43).

In  general,  all  the  experiments  performed  with  these  com-
pounds must be considered with caution. First, they are based on 
the assumption that conventional HSP90 inhibitors such as the 
geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG are excluded from mitochon-
dria, but whether 17-AAG can penetrate into mitochondria is still 
under debate (43, 65, 73). In addition, several questions about 
the specificity of these compounds and the mechanism of their 
antitumor activity have not been answered yet. In this context, it 
is still unclear whether it is necessary to inhibit single or multiple 
HSP90  chaperones  in  mitochondria  to  obtain  clinical  relevant 
anticancer activity. As there is a significant diversity in the ATP-
binding affinity between TRAP1 and HSP90, the same compound 
may not be able to target multiple HSP90 chaperones with the 
same efficiency, and the degree of selectivity it displays toward 
different  chaperones  is  unknown.  Possible  off-target  effects  of 
these  molecules  also  depend  on  whether  they  can  target  only 
mitochondrial HSP90 family chaperones or also their cytosolic 
counterparts, an issue that is not fully understood. It is therefore 
mandatory to design highly selective TRAP1 inhibitors that can 
be used as potential antineoplastic lead compounds.

Development of Specific TRAP1 inhibitors: 
An innovative Strategy for Cancer 
Treatment
To  achieve  TRAP1-specific  inhibition,  alternative  approaches 
may be proposed to exploit the structural peculiarities of TRAP1. 
Allosteric targeting of TRAP1 may represent a viable strategy to 
identify isoform-specific ligands. Allostery is the prime mecha-
nism  by  which  functional  regulation  can  be  achieved  via  the 
activation of specific conformational states that meet functional 
requirements.  Allosteric  drugs  might  display  high  selectivity, 
since proteins of the same family with a high degree of sequence 
conservation  in  their  active  sites  can  have  different  sequences 
and structures at allosteric sites. The atomistic understanding of 
allosteric mechanisms of protein regulation provides the basis for 
the development of new drug candidates.

In this context, it is possible to characterize the main traits of 
nucleotide-regulated internal dynamics of TRAP1 using all atom 
molecular dynamics simulations, with the aim of identifying the 
most  responsive  regions  located  outside  of  the  ATP-site.  Such 
approach has already proven effective in the design of allosteric 
anticancer  leads  against  HSP90  (102,  107).  Allosteric  sites  are 
located in the M-domain and in the CTD of TRAP1 (Figure 4) 
and their stereoelectronic properties can be used to design a new

class of small molecule inhibitors. These new leads can represent 
novel chemical tools to perturb TRAP1 conformational dynam-
ics.  Therefore,  they  could  be  exploited  to  study  how  TRAP1 
conformational changes reverberate on the interaction between 
chaperone and clients, on regulation of signaling and metabolic 
pathways in mitochondria and eventually on the role played by 
TRAP1 in tumorigenesis.

types and stages the metabolic rewiring prompted by TRAP1 
is  pivotal  for  neoplastic  progression.  The  identification  of 
highly selective compounds to modulate its chaperone activity 
will be instrumental to dissect how TRAP1 acts in tumor cell 
mitochondria and to understand its importance as a molecular 
target for innovative antineoplastic strategies or for the setup 
of novel combinatorial therapies.

CONCLuDiNg ReMARKS

Additional clues about TRAP1 role in tumors can only derive 
from a more in-depth characterization of its mode of action 
and  regulation.  The  complexity  of  TRAP1  effects  on  tumor 
cells could stem from several factors, including TRAP1 regu-
lation  by  several  PTMs  and  possibly  cochaperones,  and  the 
possibility that it interacts with other client proteins in cells 
endowed with continuously changing energy needs under the 
pressure  of  diverse  environmental  factors.  In  this  scenario, 
the possibility of connecting TRAP1 chaperone activity with 
oncogenic  transduction  pathways,  such  as  hyperactive  Ras/
ERK signaling, opens new avenues to elucidate in which tumor
