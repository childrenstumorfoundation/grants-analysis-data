Abstract
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly
invasive soft tissue sarcomas that arise within the peripheral
nerve and frequently metastasize. To identify molecular events
contributing to malignant transformation in peripheral nerve,
we compared eight cell lines derived from MPNSTs and seven
normal human Schwann cell samples. We found that MPNST
lines are heterogeneous in their in vitro growth rates and
exhibit diverse alterations in expression of pRb, p53, p14Arf,
and p16INK4a proteins. All MPNST cell
lines express the
epidermal growth factor receptor and lack S100B protein.
Global gene expression profiling using Affymetrix oligonucle-
otide microarrays identified a 159-gene molecular signature
distinguishing MPNST cell lines from normal Schwann cells,
which was validated in Affymetrix microarray data generated
from 45 primary MPNSTs. Expression of Schwann cell differ-
entiation markers (SOX10, CNP, PMP22, and NGFR) was down-
regulated in MPNSTs whereas neural crest stem cell markers,
SOX9 and TWIST1, were overexpressed in MPNSTs. Previous
studies have implicated TWIST1 in apoptosis inhibition,
resistance to chemotherapy, and metastasis. Reducing TWIST1
expression in MPNST cells using small interfering RNA did not
affect apoptosis or chemoresistance but inhibited cell chemo-
taxis. Our results highlight the use of gene expression profiling
in identifying genes and molecular pathways that are potential
biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for treatment of MPNST
and support the use of the MPNST cell lines as a primary
analytic tool. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(5): 2584-91)

Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are
aggressive soft tissue sarcomas with poor prognosis. Excision of
the tumor does not always prevent local recurrence, and meta-
stases to the lung, liver, and brain are common. Current therapeutic
regimens have limited use because the tumors are generally
resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation (1). Half of all

MPNSTs are sporadic in nature; half arise in individuals with
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder
affecting 1 in 2,500 to 3,500 individuals worldwide (2). MPNSTs
represent a major cause of mortality in NF1 patients (3). Nearly
all NF1 patients develop benign dermal neurofibromas and f30%
of NF1 patients have benign plexiform neurofibromas (4) which,
unlike dermal neurofibromas, can undergo malignant transfor-
mation to MPNST (5). Greater than 50% of MPNSTs contain cells
immunoreactive for S100h protein, suggesting that tumors arise
from neoplastic Schwann cells or their precursors (6).

Human tumor cell lines have historically served as experimental
models for the study of tumor cell biology and drug development. A
small number of cell lines, derived from NF1-associated MPNSTs
(7–10) or sporadic MPNSTs (11, 12), have been reported in the
literature but have never been directly compared with each other
and primary tumors. These cell lines are a valuable resource as
primary MPNSTs are difficult to permanently establish in culture.
Here, we used MPNST cell lines to identify differences between
MPNST cells and normal human Schwann cells (NHSC), the
proposed cell of origin for MPNST.

Molecular events contributing to peripheral nerve tumor devel-
opment are unclear. In the context of NF1, loss of the NF1 protein
product is believed to be the earliest event as patients inherit a
mutated NF1 allele and lose the second copy in MPNST cells. Loss of
NF1 has also been documented in sporadic cases of MPNST (13).
Another early alteration in MPNST development is the expression of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Whereas EGFR is not
expressed in NHSCs, the protein is detected in primary MPNSTs,
MPNST cell lines, and subpopulations of neurofibroma Schwann
cells (14). Additional genetic mutations targeting regulators of the
retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways
seem to represent later events in malignant transformation of
Schwann cells as they are not observed in neurofibromas (15–17).

In this study, we identify a gene expression profile that
distinguishes MPNST cell
lines from NHSCs and validate this
MPNST cell line gene signature in a large panel of primary MPNSTs.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that one candidate gene over-
expressed in all MPNST samples, TWIST1, is an attractive thera-
peutic target for novel MPNST treatment strategies.

established according to published criteria (NIH Consensus Statement).
Frozen, archived tumor specimen pathology was reviewed and RNA
isolated and then analyzed on Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChip microarrays
as reported (18).

Cell culture. T265p21, 90-8, ST88-14, 88-3, and STS26T cell lines were
provided by Jeff DeClue (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The YST-1
cell line was provided by Yoji Nagashima (University School of Medicine,
Yokohama,
Japan). Human Narf cells that express isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-
galactopyranoside (IPTG)–inducible human ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)
were provided by Gordon Peters (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London,
United Kingdom). ST88-14, STS26T, S520, S462, and Narf lines were grown in
DMEM (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). 88-3, 90-8, and T265p21 lines were
grown in a RPMI 1640–based medium as described (7). The YST-1 line was
grown in RPMI 1640 (Fisher Scientific) containing 10% FBS. NHSCs were
generated as previously described (19). Analyses were done under standard
culture conditions for each cell line. Several assays were not conducted on the
88-3 cells due to difficulties in culturing this line.

NF1 mutation analysis. DNA was isolated from frozen STS26T or YST1
cell pellets. The NF1 gene was screened for mutations by denaturing high-
performance liquid chromatography–based heteroduplex analysis using the
WAVE analysis system (Transgenomic, Omaha, NE) as described. Several
primer sequences were redesigned to reduce their homology to the NF1
pseudogenes sequences (20).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. Cells (5  103) were plated in triplicate on a 24-well plate (day 0).
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was done on day 1 and day 4 by adding 50 AL of a 5 mg/mL MTT
solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to each well. Following incubation
at 37jC for 2 hours, the formazan precipitate was extracted in isopropanol-
HCl and absorbance measured at 540 nm. For Taxol sensitivity assays, the
noted concentration of paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium
on day 1. Concentration of paclitaxel was based on previous studies (21).
Viability assay. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips. Live versus dead
cell numbers were determined using a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity kit
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the protocol of
the
manufacturer. The total number of live and dead cells was counted in
five fields per sample and averaged. Assays were done in duplicate.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Twenty-four hours post plating
3  104 cells onto glass coverslips, cells were labeled for 1 hour with
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling reagent (1:1,000; Amersham Bio-
sciences, Piscataway, NJ) to detect DNA synthesis. Cells were fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific), permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibodies (1:200;
Accurate Chemical & Scientific, Westbury, NY) in immunofluorescence
buffer [20 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 units DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)]
for 45 minutes at 37jC. Cell nuclei and BrdUrd localization were visualized
by incubating in 5 Ag/mL bisbenzamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and rhodamine-
conjugated donkey anti-Rat secondary antibodies (1:100;
Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Total number of cells and number of
BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in five fields per sample and averaged.
Assays were done in duplicate.

Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed on ice in 50 mmol/L Tris (pH
7.5), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.1 mmol/L sodium
vanadate, 1 mmol/L sodium flouride, 5 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 30 Amol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl
flouride. Lysates were sonicated and clarified by
centrifugation. Equivalent amounts of protein (50-100 Ag) were separated
by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (7-15% or 4-20%;
ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were probed with anti-ARF
(NB 200-111; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-RB (clone G3-245;
BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-p16 (Ab-1; Research
Products, San Diego, CA), anti-p53 (D0-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), anti-HDM2 (2A10 hybridoma supernatant provided by Gerry
Zambetti, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, and Arnold
Levine, Cancer Institute of New Jersey/UMDNJ, New Brunswick, NJ), or anti-
TWIST1 antibodies (22). Blots were stripped and reprobed with antitubulin

(Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-h-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers,
MA) as a loading control. Signals were detected using horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in
combination with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus developing
system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the specifications of the
manufacturer. For TWIST1 quantification, ImageJ 1.33u software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to obtain values from scanned autoradio-
graphs representing protein levels. TWIST1 levels were normalized to
h-actin levels for each sample.

Immunohistochemistry. Cell suspensions were mounted in a HistoGel
(Richard Allan-Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI)
‘‘button’’ according to the
protocol of the manufacturer and embedded in paraffin blocks. S100h
and EGFR protein expression was determined by a semiautomated
immunohistochemical
technique as described (Ventana ES, Ventana
Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ; ref. 14).

RNA isolation and microarray hybridization. Total RNA was isolated
from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) followed by
phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA integrity
was verified with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (with typical 28S/18S
ratios = 2 F 0.1). To generate a biotinylated probe, cDNA was synthesized
(Superscript cDNA synthesis kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) from 10 Ag
RNA using an oligo(dT) primer with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at
the 5Vend. The cDNA was made double stranded and used in an in vitro
transcription reaction (Enzo Diagnostics) with T7 RNA polymerase to
synthesize biotinylated product for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips
HU133A and HU133B using the Affymetrix recommended protocol. The
Affymetrix Gene Array scanner and Micro Array Suite version 5.0 were
used to scan and quantify GeneChips using default settings.

the pattern search program from GEMS Launcher

Microarray data analysis. Microarray gene expression data (MAS *.cel
files) were initially processed using Robust Microarray Analysis (RMA;
ref. 23). RMA data were loaded into Genespring 6.1 computer software
(Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), transformed from a log 2 to linear
scale, and normalized per gene to the mean value of its level of expression
across seven NHSC samples. Welch t test/ANOVA with Benjamini multiple
testing correction was used to identify statistically significant differences
in gene expression between groups. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster
analysis using Pearson correlation for a distance metric was used to
arrange genes according to similar expression patterns. Statistical analysis
of
functional classification was used to identify altered molecular
pathways (OntoExpress; http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/). For
analysis of primary MPNSTs, raw data (*.cel) were RMA-processed,
assigned a U133 identification number, and imported into GeneSpring 6.1
for further analysis. To compare the primary MPNST data to the MPNST
cell
line and NHSC data, an additional per chip normalization to the
median was conducted, followed by per gene normalization to the NHSC
samples. To identify TWIST1 binding sites (24) in putative gene promoter
regions,
(http://
www.genomatix.de) was used to scan sequences with the IUPAC pattern.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was used
as a template to synthesize double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer
with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Duplicate reactions
omitting reverse transcriptase were conducted to control for genomic DNA
contamination. Relative levels of RNA were measured by quantitative real-
time PCR using the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System default settings. For
most genes, amplification was conducted in SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). See Supplementary Table S1 for primer
sequences for individual genes. Cycle threshold values were obtained where
fluorescence intensity was in the geometric phase of amplification and
averaged for triplicate reactions. Values for individual genes of
interest
were normalized to values for b-actin and used to calculate fold change
in gene expression using ABI software. SOX10 (ABI TaqMan Probe ID
Hs00366918_m1) and 18S (ABI TaqMan Probe ID Hs99999901_s1) were
amplified using ABI 2X Universal TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
interfering RNA transfection. MPNST cells were plated in
DMEM containing 10% FBS and no antibiotic for transfection the following
day. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules (siTWIST1 SMARTpool or
siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA Pool; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were

diluted in serum-free DMEM and incubated with XtremeGENE siRNA
transfection reagent (Roche) at room temperature for 20 minutes before
dropping on cells at a final optimal concentration of 20 nmol/L. Cell
medium was changed 24 hours posttransfection to minimize toxicity. Cells
were incubated 1 to 5 days before analyses. Transfection efficiency was
f90% as determined with a fluorescent siGLO control (Dharmacon).

Migration assay. The migratory response of MPNST cells was measured
using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Four days posttransfection with
siRNA (Dharmacon):XtremeGENE (Roche) complexes or XtremeGENE
reagent alone, 4  104 cells in serum-free DMEM were plated on the upper
chamber of a transwell with 8-Am pores (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY).
The lower chamber contained 800 AL MPNST conditioned medium. Cells
were incubated for 16 hours at 37jC in 10% CO2. Nonmigrating cells were
removed from the upper surface of the membrane with cotton swabs.
Membranes were stained with bisbenzimide and mounted onto glass slides.
Migration was quantified by counting cells in four fields. Each condition
was done in triplicate and the number of migrated cells was normalized to
the total number of cells on an unscraped filter to validate the total number
of cells plated. Data shown are representative of three independent
experiments; values presented are the mean F SD. Statistical significance
was determined by t test using Microsoft Excel software.

Results

A collection of MPNST cell lines. Eight MPNST cell

lines
were collected for analysis (Table 1). Six cell lines were derived from
NF1 patients. Two cell lines were derived from sporadic MPNSTs.
NHSCs were chosen as a control because Schwann cells or their
precursors are the most likely cells of origin in MPNSTs. Patient
information and histopathology of
the primary tumors have
previously been documented in the original articles cited in Table 1.
We confirmed that the sporadic MPNST lines STS26T and YST-1
were wild-type at the NF1 locus. All 60 exons of the NF1 gene were
screened for mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid
chromatography–based heteroduplex analysis. No mutations were
detected in the coding region of the NF1 gene in either sporadic
MPNST sample (data not shown). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at
the NF1 locus has previously been confirmed in five of the six NF1-
associated MPNST lines (8, 25, 26).

Cell growth rate varies in MPNST cell lines. We compared
growth properties of the MPNST cell lines by cell accumulation
assays (Fig. 1). There was no correlation with NF1 status and growth
rate. The fastest growing cell lines were STS26T, a sporadic MPNST
line, and T265p21, an MPNST line derived from an NF1 patient
(Fig. 1A). The more slowly proliferating cell lines, S520, 90-8, and

Figure 1. Cell growth rates vary in MPNST cell lines. MPNST cells were
seeded at equivalent cell numbers in their normal growth medium. The same
number of NHSCs was plated in the absence (NHSC) or presence of glial growth
factor (NHSC + GGF ). A, 5  103 cells were plated in triplicate on day 0.
MTT assays were done on day 1 and day 4. Absorbances were normalized
to a medium-only control. B, 3  104 cells were plated. Twenty-four hours later,
cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 1 hour and then stained for BrdUrd
incorporation. Percent of cells staining positively for BrdUrd incorporation.
At least 300 cells were counted per cell type on duplicate coverslips. C, 3  104
cells were plated. Twenty-four hours later, cells were stained with Calcein-AM
and ethidium homodimer-1. Percent of cells staining positively for ethidium-1.
Approximately 400 cells were counted per cell type on duplicate coverslips.

YST-1, evidenced density-dependent growth. At higher plating
densities, they showed more robust growth but the overall trend
in relative rates of cell accumulation remained the same (data
not shown). We determined whether different rates of cell cycle
progression or cell death accounted for the large variation in cell
proliferation among the MPNST cell lines. BrdUrd labeling of the
MPNST cell lines showed that their rates of BrdUrd incorporation
paralleled their relative rates of proliferation (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
the rates of cell death were approximately constant in all of the lines
(Fig. 1C). Thus, rates of cell proliferation vary among the MPNST cell
lines and do not distinguish the NF1-associated MPNSTs from the
sporadic MPNSTs.

Cell cycle proteins and Schwann cell markers are altered
in MPNST cell lines. Functional disruptions of the pRb tumor
suppressor pathway are frequent events in primary MPNSTs

(17, 27–29) due to inappropriate pRb phosphorylation via
dysregulation of upstream regulators (p16INK4a mutation or cyclin
overexpression) or loss of the pRB gene itself. pRb immunoreac-
tivity was detected in all of the MPNST lines, suggesting that the RB
gene itself is not lost in the tumor cells (Fig. 2A). In comparison
with NHSCs, an increase in the inactive or phosphorylated form of
pRb was detected in the 90-8, S520, ST88-14, STS26T, and YST-1 cell
lines. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) or loss
of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor can both result in enhanced pRb
phosphorylation. CDK4 was not differentially expressed between
the MPNST cell lines and NHSCs (data not shown). In contrast,
p16INK4a was expressed only in cells that were wild-type for neu-
rofibromin, NHSCs, and the two sporadic MPNST lines (Fig. 2A).
These results suggest that p16INK4a is selectively inactivated in the
NF1-associated MPNST cell lines.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently deleted, mutated,
and/or overexpressed in primary MPNSTs (15–17, 28). Therefore, we

and reprobed for tubulin as a loading control. Human Narf cells that express

assessed the integrity of the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 signaling pathway
in the MPNST cell lines in comparison with NHSCs. p14ARF was
only expressed in the sporadic MPNST cell line STS26T (Fig. 2A).
In addition, all MPNST cell lines showed a significant increase in
HDM2 expression, a negative regulator of p53, in comparison with
NHSCs (Fig. 2B). Notably, p53 was highly overexpressed in two of the
MPNST cell lines, S520 and S462, whereas a lower molecular weight
species (likely a truncated form of p53) was overexpressed in the 90-
8 line in comparison with NHSCs (Fig. 2B). The remaining MPNST
lines, ST88-14 and T265p21, both showed levels of p53 expression
that were modestly higher than that in NHSCs. One sporadic
MPNST line, YST-1, also exhibited a slight overexpression of p53 in
comparison with NHSCs whereas p53 expression was completely
absent in the STS26T sporadic MPNST line.

De novo EGFR expression has previously been implicated as an
early event in Schwann cell transformation (14, 30). We stained
NHSCs and the MPNST cell lines for EGFR and double labeled with
the Schwann cell marker S100h protein. NHSCs are S100h positive
and EGFR negative (Fig. 2C). All of the NF1-associated MPNST
lines and one sporadic MPNST line, STS26T, were strongly
immunoreactive for EGFR in 100% of the cells (Fig. 2E). The
sporadic MPNST line YST-1 exhibited moderate EGFR expression
in f50% to 60% of the cells (Fig. 2F). All of the MPNST cell lines
currently lack S100h protein expression (Fig. 2E and F) although
S100h immunoreactivity was originally reported for ST88-14,
T265p21, and YST-1 (9, 12, 31). Thus, MPNST lines aberrantly
express EGFR and lack expression of a Schwann cell marker,
perhaps reflecting progressive anaplasia or loss of differentiation.
Gene expression profile of MPNST cell lines is consistent in
MPNST in vivo. To identify gene expression changes associated with
malignant transformation of Schwann cells, we did global gene
expression analysis of MPNST cell lines using microarray technology.
We analyzed samples from six NF1-associated MPNST lines, two
sporadic MPNST cell lines, and seven NHSC samples on Affymetrix
GeneChips containing >45,000 probe sets (f39,000 transcripts and
f33,000 annotated genes). To identify genes consistently expressed
within the MPNST cell
lines and relevant to Schwann cells, we
compared average MPNST cell line gene expression to average NHSC
gene expression and identified 941 probe sets differentially expressed
by
3-fold, 841 of which were statistically significant (P < 0.01, Welch
t test with Benjamini correction). To minimize false positives, we
eliminated genes differentially expressed 3-fold in at least one
normal reference sample (NHSC), reducing the number of probe sets
to 592 consistently expressed among NHSCs and differentially
expressed in MPNST cell lines (Fig. 3A).

z

Statistical analysis of functional classifications of these genes
emphasized cell growth and differentiation, cell adhesion/migra-
tion, and immune response as key dysregulated cellular systems.
Decreased expression of many Schwann cell markers, including
S100B, PMP-22, NGFR, CNP, and SOX10, indicates aberrant differ-
entiation in the MPNSTcells. However, GFAP and MBP are expressed
at similar levels in NHSC and the MPNST cell lines. Alterations in the
pRb and p53 pathways are supported by the up-regulation of nine
E2F targets (32) and three p53 targets, GADD-45 (33), Sema3B (34),
and DDA3 (35). Genes within the MPNST molecular profile do not
overlap with a generalized tumor cell
line list generated by
microarray analysis of the NCI 60 cancer lines (36) or a list of 24
genes up-regulated in synovial sarcomas and 4 MPNSTs (37).

To validate the data and to assess the utility of MPNST cell lines
as a model for MPNST in vivo, the microarray data generated from
the MPNST cell lines and NHSC were compared with microarray

data generated from 45 primary MPNST samples hybridized to
Affymetrix U95 chips, containing f12,000 probe sets representing
f10,000 annotated genes (18). Nearly all of the genes represented
on the U95 chip were also on the U133 chip, resulting in 9,433
overlapping genes. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the
9,433 probe sets across all samples distinguished normal samples,
NHSCs, from tumor samples, MPNST cells, and primary MPNSTs
(data not shown). When we examined expression of the 592 probe
sets differentially expressed in MPNST cell lines (described above)
in the primary MPNST samples, approximately one third (209 of
592) were represented on both the U133 and U95 chips (Fig. 3A).
Therefore, the gene list we refer to as the MPNST molecular
signature is not a complete profile of global gene expression.
However, the majority (162 of 209) of probe sets that distinguished

MPNST cells from NHSCs and were represented on both platforms
predicted gene expression changes in solid tumors, validating the
use of the MPNST cell lines as an in vitro tumor model system.
Three genes were represented by duplicate probes, resulting in a
159-gene signature for MPNST.

Hierarchical cluster analysis of the 209 probe sets differentially
expressed in MPNST cell
lines and represented in the primary
MPNST data set revealed three distinct clusters (see Supplemen-
tary Table S2): (a) 10 genes up-regulated in MPNST cell lines but
down-regulated in primary MPNSTs, (b) 13 genes up-regulated in
all MPNST samples, and (c) 146 genes down-regulated in all
MPNST samples (Fig. 3B). The 10 genes in cluster I are differentially
expressed compared with NHSC but the levels of expression are not
consistent between the MPNST cell lines and the primary MPNST

samples. The protein products of most of these genes are involved
in cell cycle progression. It is reasonable to believe that cell
lines growing in tissue culture medium may be exposed to
nonphysiologic growth-promoting conditions in vitro. Many genes
in cluster II have been implicated in other tumor systems. Genes in
cluster III include Schwann cell differentiation markers, validating
the notion that MPNST cells do not exhibit properties of differen-
tiated Schwann cells.

TWIST1 overexpression is necessary for MPNST cell
migration but not apoptosis or chemoresistance. TWIST1
gene expression was up-regulated in all MPNST cell lines and
all primary MPNSTs as compared with normal Schwann cells.
Differential expression of TWIST1 was confirmed at the RNA level
by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4A) and
at the protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). To study the
functional significance of TWIST1 overexpression in MPNST
cells, we inhibited TWIST1 expression using siRNA molecules.
We reduced TWIST1 expression at both the RNA and protein levels
to f10% to 20% compared with cells transfected with a
nontargeting siRNA control (Fig. 4C). Putative TWIST1 transcrip-
tional targets (n = 27) were identified by promoter analysis.
Differential expression of 8 of 10 targets was validated by
quantitative real-time PCR but the expression of none was altered
by siRNA exposure for 5 days (data not shown). Furthermore,
expression of known TWIST1 targets (38–40) was not significantly
different in MPNST samples as compared with NHSCs.

TWIST1 can cause tumor cell resistance to microtubule-
stabilizing drugs such as Taxol (21), an interesting finding given
the relative chemoresistance of MPNSTs. We ascertained Taxol
resistance of MPNST cell lines. All of the MPNST cell lines follow the
survival curve of the TWIST1-expressing positive control cell line,
PC3, indicating that they are relatively resistant to Taxol-induced cell
death (Fig. 5A). IC50 values for individual MPNST cell lines were
statistically different from the LNCaP TWIST1 negative control (P <
0.001; data not shown). However, reducing TWIST1 expression in
MPNST cells by transient transfection with TWIST1 siRNA did not
affect chemosensitivity (Fig. 5B). TWIST1 has also been shown to
inhibit apoptosis (38). Neither cell growth nor apoptosis was altered
in MPNST cells transfected with TWIST1 siRNA (data not shown).
TWIST1 can promote tumor cell migration, invasion (41), and
metastasis (39). To examine TWIST1 function in MPNST migration,
we tested whether MPNST cells were migratory in an in vitro
migration assay. Interestingly, the MPNST cells did not have a
haptotactic phenotype; they did not migrate in the serum-free or
serum-containing medium. Because EGFR is overexpressed in
MPNST cells, we added EGF to the standard serum-containing
medium but observed minimal migration. MPNST conditioned
medium was required for significant chemotactic migration (data
not shown), suggesting that MPNST cells may be secreting as yet
unidentified chemoattractant(s). Migration was inhibited by 75%
in STS26T MPNST cells transfected with TWIST1 siRNA (Fig. 5C).
Thus, MPNST cell migration is dependent on TWIST1 expression
itself or expression of TWIST1 transcriptional targets.

Discussion

We compared primary human Schwann cells to 8 MPNST cell
lines and 45 solid MPNSTs. Rates of proliferation and gene
expression profiles of the MPNST cell lines were variable, mirroring
the heterogeneity of these tumors in vivo. Nevertheless, our
microarray gene expression analyses of Schwann cells and MPNST

lines resulted in the identification of a specific 159-gene profile for
MPNST that was validated in a large panel of primary MPNSTs. The
genes in the MPNST signature, many of which have been
implicated in other types of cancer, represent potential regulators
of MPNST pathogenesis.

Disruption of cell cycle regulation was apparent in the MPNST
lines but consistent alterations in neither pRb-related nor
cell
p53-related proteins were observed. The p16INK4a protein was
absent in five of five NF1-associated MPNST cell lines whereas
both sporadic lines and NHSCs retained p16INK4a expression.
Homozygous deletion of p16INK4a has been detected in both NF1-
associated and sporadic MPNSTs, but not in benign neurofibromas,
suggesting that its loss contributes to malignant transformation

(27, 30, 42). Although loss of p16INK4a would be predicted to
enhance pRb phosphorylation, we found no clear correlation
between the expression level or phosphorylation status of pRb
and the presence of p16INK4a in the MPNST cells. Comparative
analysis of ARF revealed a lack of expression in all cells examined
except the sporadic MPNST line STS26T. Detection of ARF in
STS26T is consistent with the absence of p53 in those cells. The
absence of ARF in primary NHSCs is not surprising because ARF is
repressed by a variety of factors in normal cells. Others have shown
that dual loss of p16INK4a and ARF pathways is required for trans-
formation by Ras, EGFR, and other oncogenes (reviewed in ref. 43).
The microarray data confirmed differential expression of some
genes that have previously been implicated in NF1 tumor formation
but solely in subsets of cell lines and tumors. Midkine is a secreted
protein that promotes angiogenesis and is up-regulated in a variety
of tumors (reviewed in ref. 44), including 5 of 8 of the MPNST cell
lines and 22 of 45 of the primary MPNST samples. We observed CD44
overexpression in 3 of 8 MPNST cell lines but no primary MPNSTs
(45). Whereas HGF/c-Met signaling can promote MPNST invasion,
there was no indication of dysregulated c-Met-related genes in our

MPNST microarray data; secretion of HGF and signaling through
c-Met may not be apparent at the transcriptional level (46). We
confirmed that all MPNST cell lines, but not NHSCs, were positive for
EGFR protein. Our previous analysis of the MPNST primary tumors
revealed a statistically significant difference in expression profiles of
EGFR-positive versus EGFR-negative MPNSTs (18). These observa-
tions suggest that aberrant expression of these genes may not
be necessary for Schwann cell transformation and/or MPNSTs
expressing these genes may represent a distinct subclass. Alter-
natively, these genes may be expressed in different populations of
cells within each primary tumor.

Genes that are down-regulated in the MPNST molecular profile
include several markers of Schwann cell differentiation, suggesting
that MPNST cells have dedifferentiated or represent a Schwann cell
precursor that has acquired mutations leading to tumor formation.
SOX10 expression is down-regulated in MPNSTs and normally
regulates expression of genes promoting Schwann cell differenti-
ation (47). A recent study by Levy et al. (48) reports reduced levels
of SOX10 and other Schwann cell markers in 9 MPNST samples
compared with 14 benign neurofibroma samples by quantitative
real-time PCR. SOX9 (49) and TWIST1 (24) are expressed in neural
crest stem cells, Schwann cell precursors, and are overexpressed in
MPNSTs compared with NHSCs. Although Schwann cells are the
proposed cell of origin in MPNSTs, comparisons to additional
tumors and normal tissues may reveal other genes relevant to
MPNST formation or progression. The idea that tumor cells
resemble progenitor cells is supported in other tumor models (50).
We identified TWIST1 as a previously unrecognized cancer-
related gene in MPNST. TWIST1 gene expression is up-regulated in
both MPNST cell
lines and primary tumors. TWIST1 is also
overexpressed in other tumors, including sarcomas (21, 38, 39).
TWIST1 is normally expressed early in development and regulates
cell type determination and differentiation of mesodermal tissues
(reviewed in ref. 24). TWIST1 inhibits expression of ARF, as
observed in seven of eight of the MPNST cell lines, which results
in a bypass of p53-induced apoptosis (38). TWIST1 can inhibit
apoptosis and promote cell transformation (38). However, we did
not detect a significant change in apoptosis on reducing TWIST1
expression in MPNST cells. In several human carcinoma cell lines,
TWIST1 can prevent cell death in the presence of microtubule-
stabilizing chemotherapeutic agents (21) and stable suppression
of TWIST1 increases sensitiviy to Taxol-induced cell death (41).
MPNSTs are poorly responsive to standard chemotherapeutic
regimens and we showed that MPNST cell
lines are resistant
to Taxol. However, transiently reducing TWIST1 expression did not
result in Taxol sensitivity in our MPNST cell accumulation assay.

TWIST1 is necessary and sufficient for prostate cancer cell
migration and invasion in vitro (41). Suppression of TWIST1 inhibits
metastasis in a murine breast tumor model (39). MPNSTs are highly
invasive tumors that commonly metastasize. Reducing TWIST1
expression in MPNST cells inhibited chemotaxis, a key component of
the metastatic process. Although many of the genes that are
overexpressed in MPNST cells compared with NHSCs are implicated
in cell adhesion, migration, or invasion, none are known chemo-
attractants. It is possible that hypersecretion and not transcriptional
overexpression of a chemoattractant may promote MPNST cell
migration.

We conclude that whereas MPNST cell lines are heterogeneous in
cellular growth, a common gene expression profile in MPNST cell
lines and primary MPNSTs distinguishes them from normal
Schwann cells. The MPNST cell
lines thus provide a valuable

resource for generating in vitro evidence to support preclinical and
clinical trials. Overexpression of TWIST1 is constant across all tested
MPNST cell lines and primary tumors and is necessary for cell
migration. Further investigation into the functional roles of TWIST1
and its transcriptional targets may help to uncover novel biomarkers
or drug targets for improved diagnosis and treatment of MPNST.
