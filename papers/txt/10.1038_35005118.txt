Nuclear translocation and
transcription regulation by the
membrane-associated
guanylate kinase CASK/LIN-2

Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) contain mul-
tiple protein-binding domains that allow them to assemble
speciﬁc multiprotein complexes in particular regions of the
cell1,2. CASK/LIN-2, a MAGUK required for EGF receptor locali-
zation and signalling in Caenorhabditis elegans, contains a cal-
modulin-dependent protein kinase-like domain followed by PDZ,
SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains3–5. In adult rat brain,
CASK is concentrated at neuronal synapses and binds to the cell-
surface proteins neurexin and syndecan6–8 and the cytoplasmic
proteins Mint/LIN-10 and Veli/LIN-7 (refs 4, 9, 10). Here we
report that, through its guanylate kinase domain, CASK interacts
with Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor that is involved in
forebrain development11,12. CASK enters the nucleus and binds
to a speciﬁc DNA sequence (the T-element) in a complex with Tbr-
1. CASK acts as a coactivator of Tbr-1 to induce transcription of T-
element containing genes, including reelin, a gene that is essential
for cerebrocortical development. Our ﬁndings show that a
MAGUK which is usually associated with cell junctions has a
transcription regulation function.

To identify binding partners for the guanylate kinase (GK)
domain of CASK, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen of
brain complementary DNA libraries, from which Tbr-1 was isolated
(Fig. 1a). Tbr-1 bound to the GK domain of CASK but not the GK
domain of PSD-95. By deletion analysis, the carboxy-terminal
region of Tbr-1 (residues 342–681) was found to be necessary
and sufﬁcient for association with the GK domain of CASK (Fig. 1a).
A biochemical association of full-length CASK and Tbr-1 was
conﬁrmed in mammalian cells. When co-expressed in COS-7
cells, Tbr-1 and CASK were readily co-precipitated by antibodies
directed against either individual protein (Fig. 1b). Chapsyn-110, a
member of the PSD-95 subfamily of MAGUKs, was not co-pre-
cipitated with Tbr-1 (Fig. 1b). These biochemical data support the
yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1a), conﬁrming a speciﬁc interaction
of Tbr-1 and CASK.

If CASK interacts physiologically with Tbr-1, it might redistribute
into the nucleus in a Tbr-1-dependent fashion. After transfection in
COS cells, Tbr-1 immunoreactivity was concentrated in nuclei
(Fig. 2a). CASK, when expressed by itself, was cytoplasmic and
relatively excluded from nuclei of COS-7 cells (Fig. 2b). Upon co-
expression with Tbr-1, however, CASK redistributed into nuclei
where it co-localized with Tbr-1 (Fig. 2e). This nuclear transloca-
tion is speciﬁc for CASK, because Tbr-1 did not cause the nuclear
localization of other MAGUK proteins, for example, chapsyn-110
(Fig. 2c, h) and PSD-95 (Fig. 2d, i). A deletion mutant of CASK
lacking the GK domain remained predominantly cytoplasmic even
in the presence of nuclear Tbr-1 (Fig. 2f). Moreover, a mutant of
Tbr-1 lacking the CASK-binding C-terminal region was unable to
redistribute CASK into the nucleus, even though this Tbr-1 mutant
itself targeted to nuclei (Fig. 2g). The nuclear localization of CASK

therefore depends on the interaction between the C-terminal region
of Tbr-1 and the GK domain of CASK.

When co-transfected with haemagglutin in A (HA)-tagged Tbr-1
into cultured hippocampal neurons, CASK similarly accumulated
in the nucleus with Tbr-1 (Fig. 2k). Transfection of HA–Tbr-1 alone
caused endogenous CASK to partition into neuronal nuclei (Fig. 2j).
Thus Tbr-1-dependent nuclear translocation of CASK occurs in
neurons as well as heterologous cells.

We considered whether the Tbr-1-dependent nuclear localization
of CASK could be inﬂuenced by binding partners of CASK that are
usually localized to the cell surface, such as the syndecan family of
transmembrane heparan sulphate proteoglycans7,13. When synde-
can-3 was co-expressed with Tbr-1 and CASK in COS cells, CASK
no longer accumulated speciﬁcally in the nucleus but instead co-
localized with syndecan-3 in a perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-like pattern in the cytoplasm (compare Fig. 2l, middle, with
2e, left), even though Tbr-1 was concentrated in the nucleus of the
same cell (Fig. 2l, right). These data suggest that the subcellular
distribution of CASK may be regulated by the balance of its various
binding partners in different subcellular compartments.

Does the Tbr-1–CASK complex bind to a speciﬁc DNA regulatory
element? As the T-box of Tbr-1 is closely related to the T-box of
Brachyury, we ﬁrst examined whether Tbr-1 can recognize the ‘T-
element’, the DNA target sequence for Brachyury14. In gel-mobility
shift assays, nuclear extracts puriﬁed from COS cells expressing Tbr-
1 caused a retardation of the T-element oligonucleotide probe
(Fig. 3a, lane 3, band I). Peptide antibodies raised against either
the carboxy or amino terminus of Tbr-1 (TBR-C and TBR-N)
caused a supershift of this band,
indicating that the retarded
complex contains Tbr-1 (Fig. 3a, lanes 4 and 5, band II). Com-
petition controls with unlabelled oligonucleotides conﬁrmed the
speciﬁcity of T-element binding of Tbr-1 (data not shown).

We tested whether CASK can associate with Tbr-1 in a DNA-
binding complex in two ways. First, the GK domain of CASK was

letters to nature

added as a puriﬁed gluthathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein
to Tbr-1 nuclear extracts in the presence of the T-element probe.
Addition of GK domain of CASK caused a further retardation of the
Tbr-1–DNA complex in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b, lanes
12–14, arrow), whereas GST alone had no effect (lane 11). TBR-N
antibodies supershifted this GST–CASK–Tbr-1–T-element com-
plex (Fig. 3b,
lane 15, asterisk), conﬁrming that this complex
contains Tbr-1. Second, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS
cells co-transfected with CASK and Tbr-1 (Fig. 3c). These CASK–
Tbr-1 nuclear extracts shifted the T-element oligo to a major band
similarly to Tbr-1 alone (lane 20, band ‘I’), suggesting that Tbr-1 is
in excess in these nuclear extracts or that the CASK–Tbr-1–DNA
complex migrates similarly to the Tbr-1–DNA complex. This
complex could be supershifted with TBR-N or TBR-C antibodies,
as expected (lanes 21, 22, band II). Signiﬁcantly, antibodies to CASK
also caused a similar, albeit weaker, supershift in Tbr-1–CASK
nuclear extract (lane 23), which was not seen in nuclear extracts
expressing Tbr-1 alone (lane 19), or Tbr-1 and CASKDGK (lane 28).
Thus, CASK is present in a T-element-binding complex, and
formation of this complex requires the GK domain of CASK.
Notably, when antibodies to both CASK and Tbr-1 are added to
CASK–Tbr-1 nuclear extracts, a new ‘supersupershifted’ T-element
complex was formed that barely entered the gel (lanes 24–25, band III).
This slow-migrating complex, which presumably contained T-element,
Tbr-1, and CASK plus antibodies to Tbr-1 and CASK, was not seen
with the Tbr-1–CASKDGK nuclear extract (Fig. 3c, lanes 26–27),
indicating that the GK domain is required for CASK to associate
with Tbr-1 and the T-element DNA. Collectively, the gel-retardation
data show that CASK forms a GK domain-dependent complex with
Tbr-1 that binds to the T-element DNA sequence.

Figure 3 Tbr-1–CASK complex binds to T-element DNA. a, Tbr-1 binds the T-element in
gel-mobility shift assays. Labelled T-element oligonucleotide was mixed with nuclear
extract (NE) from COS-7 cells transfected with Tbr-1, CASK or vector control. In addition,
protein-A-puriﬁed TBR-N, TBR-C and CASK antibodies, or control non-immune antibodies
(IgG), were added to supershift Tbr-1-containing DNA complexes. b, GK domain of CASK
supershifts the Tbr-1–DNA complex. Increasing amounts (0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 mg) of
puriﬁed GST-fusion protein containing the GK domain of CASK were added to Tbr-1
nuclear extract and the mixtures were analysed by T-element gel-shift assay. GST alone
(1.5 mg) was used as a negative control. c, Ternary complex of full-length CASK, Tbr-1
and T-element. Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected (Txf) with Tbr-1 alone or in
combination with CASK or CASKDGK, as indicated, were used in T-element gel-shift
assays. Each reaction contained anti-CASK, anti-Tbr-1 or pre-immune IgG, as indicated.
The total amount of antibody was equalized by addition of pre-immune IgG. Retarded
protein–DNA complexes are labelled I, II and III.

Tbr-1 is more highly expressed in embryonic brain11 (Fig. 4a),
therefore the interaction between Tbr-1 and CASK may be parti-
cularly important in developing brain. Expression of CASK is
roughly constant from embryonic day E17 to postnatal day P42.
A signiﬁcant fraction of CASK is present in nuclei puriﬁed from E17
and P5 cerebral cortex (Fig. 4a). Roughly 10–20% of CASK was
present
in nuclei at E17, and this percentage declined with
development; at P42, nuclear CASK was barely detectable by
immunoblotting. Several cytoplasmic proteins (chapsyn-110, b-
tubulin, dynamin, MAP2c) were not detected in the puriﬁed
nuclear fractions; thus, the CASK signal in E17 and P5 nuclei is
unlikely to represent cytoplasmic contamination.

To examine whether Tbr-1 and CASK coexist in the same nuclei
of prenatal neocortex, we carried out double-label immunoﬂuor-
escence confocal microscopy on E19 brain sections. As expected,
Tbr-1 was localized in the nuclei of neurons (Fig. 4c, right). CASK
was diffusely distributed, mainly in a cytoplasmic pattern. However,
there was weak but signiﬁcant immunoreactivity for CASK in nuclei
(Fig. 4c, left), resulting in a relatively ‘ﬁlled-in’ appearance of the
nuclei compared with MAP2 staining at E19 (Fig. 4d, left) or CASK
staining at P42 (Fig. 4e, left), both of which were excluded from
nuclei. We used quantitative immunoﬂuorescence to estimate the
fraction of CASK in nuclei (Fig. 4f). About 20% of CASK immuno-
ﬂuorescence was localized to nuclei in E19 rat brain, consistent with
immunoblotting data (Fig. 4a). In contrast, nuclear immunoreac-
tivity of MAP2 in E19 rat brain represented only ,3% of the total,
and nuclear CASK in P42 brain was undetectable (Fig. 4f).

We could co-immunoprecipitate Tbr-1 (but not PSD-95) from
embryonic cortex using CASK antibodies (Fig. 4b, left), and vice
versa (Fig. 4b, right), providing more evidence for the association of
CASK and Tbr-1 in vivo. We were unable to co-immunoprecipitate
CASK and Tbr-1 from P42 brain when expression of Tbr-1 was low.
There is a change in the subcellular distribution of Tbr-1 and
CASK during cortical development (Fig. 4c, e). In P42 cortex, CASK
is found in a punctate pattern in the neuropil, with additional
cytoplasmic staining in neuronal cell bodies (Fig. 4e, left). At this
stage, Tbr-1 is still present in the nucleus of neurons, but no longer
restricted to nuclei as it was at E19. Instead, Tbr-1 distribution
extends into the cytoplasm of P42 neurons (Fig. 4e, right), over-
lapping considerably with CASK outside of the nucleus.

What is the functional consequence of CASK binding on the
putative transcriptional activity of Tbr-1? First, we tested whether

Tbr-1 affects the expression of a luciferase reporter gene placed
under the control of an upstream T-element (T-luc) in heterologous
cells. Consistent with earlier studies14, Brachyury strongly stimu-
lated T-luc expression (,20-fold, Fig. 5a). In comparison, Tbr-1
induction of T-luc expression was weak (,two–threefold relative to
vector control). Co-expression of CASK, however, enhanced the
transcription stimulation by Tbr-1 to ,10-fold (Fig. 5a). A CASK
mutant with deleted GK domain (CASKDGK) was unable to
stimulate Tbr-1 activation of T-luc, and wild-type CASK had no
effect on the transcription activity of Brachyury. In addition, CASK
itself had no signiﬁcant effect on T-luciferase expression (Fig. 5a).
We conclude that CASK speciﬁcally stimulates transcriptional
activity of Tbr-1 by GK-dependent binding to Tbr-1.

A fusion protein of the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain and the C-
terminal region of Tbr-1 (GAL-4–Tbr-1C) had no effect on the
GAL-4-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the CASK-
binding domain of Tbr-1 itself has no transcriptional activity.
However, co-expression of CASK with GAL-4–Tbr-1C greatly
stimulated GAL4-luc expression (Fig. 5b), conﬁrming that CASK
can act as a ‘coactivator’ of Tbr-1. CASK mutants individually
lacking calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), Veli/LIN-7-
binding, PDZ or SH3 domains were still able to coactivate GAL4-luc
transcription in the presence of GAL-4–Tbr-1C, but deleting the
GK domain abolished this activity (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the GK
domain alone was as effective as full-length CASK (Fig. 5b); thus,
the GK domain of CASK is necessary and sufﬁcient for the
coactivator activity of CASK on Tbr-1.

We also tested the transcriptional effects of Tbr-1 and CASK in
neurons. Overexpression of Tbr-1 in cultured neurons stimulated
expression of the co-transfected T-luc reporter gene (Fig. 6a).
Notably, in contrast to the data from COS cells, transfection of
CASK alone was able to induce T-luc expression in cultured neurons
(.10-fold; Fig. 6a). This result can be explained by the fact that Tbr-
1 is endogenously expressed in these neurons (data not shown). Co-
transfection of both CASK and Tbr-1 further enhanced T-luc

activity (Fig. 6a). The stimulatory effect of CASK on T-element-
directed transcription therefore occurs in neurons as well as
heterologous cells.

Tbr-1 expression is highly restricted to cerebral cortex, particu-
larly at prenatal stages11, and is undetectable in lung, heart, liver and
kidney of E20 rat embryos (data not shown), suggesting that Tbr-1
may have a role in cerebral cortex development. Consistent with this
idea, Tbr-1 knockout mice show a developmental phenotype similar
to Reeler mice, which is characterized by abnormal lamination of
cerebral cortex12. We noticed that the 59 upstream region of the
reelin gene (which is mutated in Reeler mice) contains two half-
palindromes of the T-element, and we proposed that reelin gene
transcription may be controlled by Tbr-1–CASK. To test this idea,
we determined in transfected neurons the activity of Tbr-1 and
CASK on a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the reelin 59
upstream region (Reelin-luc). Tbr-1 itself stimulated Reelin-luc
expression only modestly (,twofold relative to control vector;
Fig. 6b), perhaps because Tbr-1 binds weakly to half-palindromes
of the T-element. Overexpression of CASK by itself greatly induced
expression of Reelin-luc in neurons (,16 fold; Fig. 6b). Moreover,
when co-transfected with both CASK and Tbr-1, expression of
Reelin-luc was further enhanced (,28 fold; Fig. 6b). In addition to
conﬁrming the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CASK, these
results indicate that the Tbr-1–CASK complex can positively
regulate a natural gene promoter in neurons and suggest that
reelin is an endogenous target gene of Tbr-1–CASK.

We have reported the ﬁrst example, to our knowledge, of a
MAGUK translocating into the nucleus, interacting with a deﬁned
transcription factor and regulating transcription. Like other
MAGUKs, CASK has been mainly characterized as a membrane-
associated scaffold protein, involved in the assembly of speciﬁc
protein complexes at sites of cell contact. By also regulating
transcription, CASK invites analogies with b-catenin, a cadherin-
binding protein that is associated with adherens junctions which
can also function as a nuclear mediator by binding to Tcf/LEF

transcription factors15,16. Another MAGUK (ZO-1) has been shown
to shift from the tight junction to the nucleus in a cell contact-
regulated manner, but the mechanism of this redistribution is
unknown17.

Although we detected nuclear CASK only in embryonic neurons,
it remains possible that CASK translocates from cell junction to
nucleus in mature neurons. Such a translocation may be highly
regulated and/or of small magnitude, thus preventing the detection
of CASK in the nuclei of mature neurons. In a heterologous system,
we have found that a transmembrane ligand of CASK (syndecan-3)
can shift the balance of CASK distribution between nucleus and
cytoplasm (Fig. 2). Studying the dynamic regulation of CASK
interactions with neurexins and syndecans may therefore be key
to understanding the potential involvement of CASK in cell surface-
M
to-nucleus signalling.

Methods
Plasmid constructs
Tbr-1 coding sequence was RT-PCR ampliﬁed from mouse brain cDNA and subcloned
into eukaryotic expression vector GW1-CMV (British Biotechnology). The HA epitope
was inserted into a unique AscI site (between residues 479–480) of Tbr-1. To construct T-
luc, two repeats of Telement (AATTTCACACCTAGGTGTGAAATT) were subcloned into
reporter plasmid DERSV90-Luc, which contains the basal promoter of RSV fused to
luciferase. Reelin-luc contains ,1 kb of 59 upstream region of the reelin gene (GenBank
accession number AC002067, nucleotides 3,700–4,620). GAL-4–Tbr-1C contains resi-
dues 342–681 of Tbr-1.

Transfection, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, luciferase assay
Transfection (using Lipofectamine), immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation
of COS-7 cells were done as described18. For immunohistochemistry, rat brain sections
were processed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence as described7, with the following
modiﬁcations. E19 rat brains were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 8C overnight,
and cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in PBS. Frozen sections (25-mm) were collected on
slides, air dried for at least 30 min, and permeabilized with methanol at - 20 8C for 20 min.
Results were viewed with an Axioskop microscope or a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal
microscope. For luciferase assays, COS-7 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons were
harvested 18–20 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured in equal amounts of
cell lysate protein using the Luciferase assay system (Promega).

Subcellular fractionaction from rat brain
Puriﬁcation of nuclei from rat cerebral cortex was done as described19.

DNA-binding gel-mobility shift assay
To prepare nuclear extracts, transfected COS-7 cells were harvested, quickly washed with
hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT), and
resuspended in a volume of hypotonic buffer about ﬁves times the packed cell volume.
Cells were swollen at 4 8C for 10 min and broken by dounce homogenization with a type B
pestle. Nuclei were collected and resuspended in buffer B (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol) containing 0.3 M KCl. The nuclei were further
extracted with gentle mixing at 4 8C for 30 min, after which nuclear debris was removed by
centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000g for 10 min. Nuclear extracts were diluted by
addition of two volumes of buffer B (reducing the concentration of KCl to 0.1 M) before
use. Gel mobility shift assays were done as described20. The T-element oligonucleotides
were annealed and labelled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [g-32P]ATP.

Full-grown Xenopus oocytes arrest at the G2/M border of meiosis
I. Progesterone breaks this arrest, leading to the resumption of the
meiotic cell cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a fertilizable
egg. In these oocytes, progesterone interacts with an unidentiﬁed
surface-associated receptor, which induces a non-transcriptional
signalling pathway that stimulates the translation of dormant
c-mos messenger RNA. Mos, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase kinase kinase, indirectly activates MAP kinase, which in
turn leads to oocyte maturation. The translational recruitment
of c-mos and several other mRNAs is regulated by cytoplasmic
polyadenylation, a process that requires two 39 untranslated
regions, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) and
the polyadenylation hexanucleotide AAUAAA1–4. Although the
signalling events that trigger c-mos mRNA polyadenylation and
translation are unclear, they probably involve the activation of
