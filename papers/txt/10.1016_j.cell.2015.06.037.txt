underlying the effects of genetic context.

SUMMARY

Many mutations cause genetic disorders. However,
two people inheriting the same mutation often have
different severity of symptoms, and this is partly ge-
netic. The effects of genetic background on mutant
phenotypes are poorly understood, but predicting
them is critical for personalized medicine. To study
this phenomenon comprehensively and systemati-
cally, we used RNAi to compare loss-of-function
phenotypes for 1,400 genes in two isolates of
C. elegans and ﬁnd that 20% of genes differ in the
severity of phenotypes in these two genetic back-
grounds. Crucially, this effect of genetic background
on the severity of both RNAi and mutant phenotypes
can be predicted from variation in the expression
levels of the affected gene. This is also true in
mammalian cells, suggesting it is a general property
of genetic networks. We suggest that differences in
the manifestation of mutant phenotypes between in-
dividuals are largely the result of natural variation in
gene expression.

INTRODUCTION

Many mutations affect phenotype.
Intriguingly, however, an
identical genetic mutation can have very different effects on
phenotype in different individuals of the same species. In part
this is due to differences in genetic background, that is, to the
speciﬁc combination of rare and common variants that comprise
each individual genome. In model organisms, this impact of dif-
ferences in genetic background on the severity of mutant pheno-
types has been known for around a century. However, although
there are many isolated examples in organisms ranging from
mouse (Dietrich et al., 1993; Hamilton and Yu, 2012; Nadeau,
2001) to yeast (Dowell et al., 2010), we still understand relatively
little about the general mechanisms underlying this effect of ge-
netic background. This is a major gap in our basic understanding
of how genotype determines phenotype.

Understanding the effect of genetic background on mutant
phenotypes also has speciﬁc medical relevance. Mendelian dis-
orders such as cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) and sickle cell anemia are the
best understood genetic diseases in humans—each disorder is

caused by inheritance of a mutation in a single gene (reviewed
in Antonarakis and Beckmann, 2006 and cataloged extensively
in the Online Inheritance in Man [OMIM] database). However,
even classic ‘‘monogenic’’ disorders such as CF show clear
genetic background effects—around half of all CF patients of
European ancestry are homozygous for the DF508 CFTR allele
(Bobadilla et al., 2002), yet they present with a broad range of
clinical symptoms due to variation in so-called ‘‘modiﬁer genes,’’
including MBL2 and TGF-b (Wright et al., 2011). Similar effects of
genetic background and modiﬁer genes on disease severity are
observed in many Mendelian disorders (Dorfman, 2012; Nadeau,
2001), and the picture emerging is that although disease risk may
be largely monogenic and its heritability predictable, the severity
of the disease phenotype is the outcome of interaction between
multiple genes (reviewed extensively in Cooper et al., 2013). We
cannot yet predict these effects of genetic background on dis-
ease severity with any accuracy, nor do we understand the gen-
eral mechanisms underlying this. Here we endeavored to carry
out a systematic study to examine the effects of genetic back-
ground on mutant phenotypes.

In C. elegans, many genome-scale RNAi screens have been
carried out. These screens have identiﬁed the majority of genes
whose knockdown causes an obviously detectable phenotype
(Kamath et al., 2003). This set of genes is analogous to the set
of human genes that cause Mendelian disorders, that is, inheri-
tance of mutant alleles of any one of these genes will have a
detectable effect on the phenotype of the individual. We selected
1,353 of these genes to cover a diverse set of RNAi phenotypes,
ranging from sterility and lethality to more subtle phenotypes
such as tissue development defects (Fraser et al., 2000; Kamath
et al., 2003)—our test set thus allows us to perturb most aspects
of C. elegans biology. By carrying out RNAi on each of these
genes in different C. elegans wild-type isolates, we can system-
atically assess the effects of genetic background on the severity
of loss-of-function phenotypes in an intact animal model.
Here we report a comparison of the RNAi phenotypes of these
1,400 test genes in two isolates of C. elegans: the canonical
N2 Bristol isolate and the CB4856 Hawaiian isolate. They differ
genetically by 1 SNP per 800 bp (Wicks et al., 2001) as well
as having many copy-number variants (Maydan et al., 2010).
They are the two best characterized C. elegans isolates—N2 is
the standard laboratory strain (Brenner, 1974), and CB4856
has also been widely used. Furthermore, the efﬁcacy of RNAi
itself has been extremely well studied in this pair of isolates
(Pollard and Rockman, 2013; Tijsterman et al., 2002). Our results

show that there is extensive variation in the severity of loss-of-
function phenotypes between individuals and that this variation
in mutant phenotypes is partly predictable from variation in
gene expression. We thus suggest that variations in personal
gene expression levels are one of the key causes of the variation
in disease severity in Mendelian disorders.

RESULTS

A Quantitative RNAi Screen Identiﬁes Many Genes with
Different RNAi Phenotypes in Two C. elegans Isolates
To assess how differences in genetic background affect the
severity of loss-of-function phenotypes, we compared the RNAi
phenotypes of each of 1,353 test genes in two isolates of
C. elegans: the canonical N2 Bristol
isolate and the CB4856
Hawaiian isolate. To measure RNAi phenotypes, we used a quan-
titative phenotyping pipeline that we adapted from methods
we had previously described (Lehner et al., 2006). In outline, in
any single RNAi assay, 15 L1-stage worms are mixed with
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-expressing bacteria targeting a
gene of interest and incubated for 4 days in 96-well plates. The
contents of each well are then analyzed using a commercially
available worm sorter—the body length and the optical density
of each worm or embryo in the sample are measured (shown
schematically in Figure 1A). In control cultures fed with non-tar-
geting dsRNA-expressing bacteria, there are 800 animals—
15 adults and their progeny (at L1, L2, or L3 larval stages).
When any of our test genes is targeted, however, we can measure
changes in brood size, embryonic lethality, and growth rate, as
illustrated schematically in Figure 1B. Almost all (1,319/1,353;
97%) of the test genes have a detectable RNAi phenotype in at
least one of these assays.

We compared RNAi phenotypes for each of the 1,353 test
genes in N2 and CB4856 in three independent biological re-
peats, each with three technical replicates as shown in Figure 1A;
details of data analysis are found in Experimental Procedures. In
broadest outline, 9% (120/1,353) of genes screened had signiﬁ-
cantly more severe phenotypes in CB4856, and 42% (570/1,353)
had more severe phenotypes in N2 (all data in Table S1). Before
analyzing these gene sets, we carried out a series of validation
steps described in the next section.

Data Validation and Conﬁrmation of Differences in RNAi
Phenotype with Mutant Alleles
To validate our data, we carried out a series of tests. First,
to conﬁrm the differences in RNAi phenotypes we observed
with the quantitative phenotyping pipeline, we repeated the
phenotyping manually. We had captured images of each well
that was analyzed using the worm sorter; two observers scored
all
images and categorized phenotypes into ﬁve classes: N2
more severe (strongly or weakly), similar phenotype in N2
and CB4856, and CB4856 more severe (strongly or weakly) (all
data in Table S1). Overall, the overlap between quantitative
and manual phenotype was 55%; that is, 382/690 of the genes
that had more severe phenotypes in N2 or CB4856 could be
conﬁrmed by manual screening. We note that almost all differ-
ences are due to the greater sensitivity of the quantitative sorter
assay because the agreement is > 90% for the largest differ-

392 Cell 162, 391–402, July 16, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Inc.

ences in phenotype (see Figures S1A and S1B). We also set up
an additional three replicates of all RNAi experiments and pheno-
typed them manually, and the results were again similar (Figures
S1A and S1B). We thus believe that the sorter data give accurate
measures of the differences in RNAi phenotype between the
isolates.

Second, we removed any confounding effects in which differ-
ences in RNAi phenotype between N2 and CB4856 were due
to differences in RNAi efﬁcacy—this can vary between isolates
of C. elegans. Differences in RNAi efﬁcacy between N2 and
CB4856 are well-characterized—CB4856 has less effective
RNAi than N2 (Pollard and Rockman, 2013; Tijsterman et al.,
2002). Thus, whereas more severe RNAi phenotypes in the
CB4856 isolate are indeed due to true differences in severity of
loss-of-function phenotype, more severe RNAi phenotypes in
N2 may be due to greater levels of knockdown in the N2 back-
ground. CB4856 has a naturally occurring null mutation in
ppw-1, a member of the Argonaute family, and genetic studies
have shown that this is the sole relevant variant affecting
RNAi efﬁcacy between N2 and CB4856 (Pollard and Rockman,
2013). We can thus control for the effect of variation in RNAi ef-
ﬁcacy by directly assessing the contribution of ppw-1 activity to
differences in RNAi phenotypes between N2 and CB4856.

To test whether the more severe RNAi phenotypes that we
see in the N2 isolate are due to differences in ppw-1 activity be-
tween N2 and CB4856, we compared the RNAi phenotypes
of all 570 genes that had more severe RNAi phenotypes in N2
in three worm strains: N2, CB4856, and the NL2550 strain.
The NL2550 strain is identical to N2 except that (like CB4856)
it is homozygous for a null mutation in ppw-1. If the RNAi phe-
notype of any gene is severe in N2 but similarly weak
in both CB4856 and NL2550, then the difference in phenotype
between N2 and CB4856 is due to differences in RNAi efﬁcacy.
Conversely,
if both N2 and NL2550 have similarly severe
phenotypes and CB4856 is weaker, then the difference in
phenotype between N2 and CB4856 is not due to variation in
ppw-1; rather, it is a true effect of the difference in genetic back-
ground between N2 and CB4856 (see Figure S1C for sche-
matic). We used a rapid manual screen to compare the RNAi
phenotypes of all 570 genes that had more severe phenotypes
in N2 in the N2, CB4856, and NL2550 strains. Each gene was
placed into one of three classes: class A, wherein the phenotype
in NL2550 is similar to that in N2 (difference in RNAi phenotype
between N2 and CB4856 is not due to ppw-1); class C, wherein
NL2550 is similar to CB4856 (difference is due to ppw-1); and
class B, wherein NL2550 has an intermediate phenotype. We
validated these data by testing a subset with our quantitative
pipeline (Figure S1D): the median contribution of variation in
ppw-1 activity to the difference in RNAi phenotype between
N2 and CB4856 in the three classes is 25%, 39%, and 74%
for classes A, B, and C, respectively. We ﬁnd that in over 75%
of the cases where genes had more severe RNAi phenotypes
in N2 than CB4856, this is largely the result of differences in
RNAi efﬁcacy (genes in class C). Removing these artifactual
hits from our data, we thus ﬁnd that 9% (127/1353) of the genes
screened have more severe loss-of-function phenotypes in N2
due largely to differences in genetic background rather than to
differences in RNAi efﬁcacy.

Figure 1. Outline of Quantitative Phenotyping Pipeline
(A) Experimental set up and sorter output. dsRNA-expressing bacteria are fed to worms in 96-well plates. Each gene is targeted in three independent cultures in
each isolate, and every plate includes six negative control cultures (‘‘Neg1’’ and ‘‘Neg2’’). The set up shown has 10 genes being targeted in N2 and CB4856 (CB).
After 96 hr, cultures are aspirated into a worm sorter that analyzes the length and darkness of each animal—we show here the full sorter data for a control culture
(‘‘Full sort’’) as well as an expanded view of the progeny (‘‘Progeny’’). Adults lie in the region marked in green, embryos and L1 animals lie in the red region, and L2
and L3 larvae in the purple region. All data appear in Table S1.
(B) Biological interpretation of sorter data. Here we show how a range of worm phenotypes appear both in sorter data and under light microscopy. Each
photograph is a composite of several high-magniﬁcation images of any single well that are computationally stitched together.

Finally, and most importantly, to validate that any difference in
RNAi phenotype between N2 and CB4856 truly reﬂects a differ-
ence in the severity of mutant phenotypes, we tested a subset
of our hits using genetic mutants. For example, CB4856 has a
more severe RNAi phenotype when we target the gene mua-3.
We constructed a CB4856 strain that is homozygous for the char-
acterized loss-of-function mua-3(rh195) allele (see Experimental
Procedures) and compared its phenotype to that of N2 worms
that are homozygous for the same mua-3(rh195) mutant allele.
The result is shown in Figure 2A: whereas N2 mua-3(rh195) worms
are mostly viable, over 80% of CB4856 mua-3(rh195) animals die
as larvae, thus conﬁrming our RNAi data. We tested eight genes

like this, restricting our choice to genes with viable, well-charac-
terized mutant alleles. These eight genes included ﬁve with
more severe RNAi phenotypes in CB4856 and three that are
more severe in N2 and cover diverse molecular pathways—
mua-3, vab-10, and unc-52 encode components of the ﬁbrous
organelle (FO), nuo-6 encodes a subunit of the electron transport
chain (ETC), cgh-1 encodes an RNA helicase, gld-1 encodes an
RNA-binding protein, unc-32 encodes a subunit of the vacuolar
ATPase, and unc-45 affects thick ﬁlaments in muscle cells.

Our results are shown in Figures 2 and 3 and Table S2—as pre-
dicted from our RNAi data, mua-3, unc-52, vab-10, and unc-32
mutants all have more severe mutant phenotypes in the

Figure 2. Mutations in Components of the FO Have More Severe Phenotypes in the CB4856 Background
We generated CB4856 strains homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in mua-3, vab-10, or unc-52 and compared their phenotypes to N2 strains carrying the
same mutant alleles.
(A) Most N2 worms homozygous for mua-3(rh195) develop into adults (cyan arrow and inset), but most CB4856 mua-3(rh195) homozygotes die as early larvae (red
arrow and inset). This difference in severity is quantiﬁed in the lefthand (LH) column graph (‘‘MUTANT,’’ p < 0.001, chi-square, error bars denote SD from ﬁve
independent measurements) and is concordant with differences in severity of RNAi phenotypes in our primary screen (boxplot labeled ‘‘RNAi’’ shows distribution
of nine measurements of brood sizes after targeting mua-3 in either N2 or CB4856, p < 0.01). Finally, the column graph at the righthand (RH) side (‘‘EXPRESSION’’)
shows the relative expression of mua-3 in either L4 animals (yellow) or young adults (YA, orange) expressed as the ratio of CB4856:N2 expression.
(B) Adult worms homozygous for the hypomorphic vab-10(e698) allele have a detachment of the hypoderm from the cuticle (yellow arrow) and head defects (red
arrow). This is more severe in the CB4856 background (column graph ‘‘MUTANT,’’ p < 0.001, chi-square, error bars denote SD from ﬁve independent mea-
surements), and this recapitulates the differences in severity of RNAi phenotypes (boxplot labeled ‘‘RNAi,’’ p < 0.001). The RH column graph (‘‘EXPRESSION’’)
shows the expression of vab-10 in L4s (yellow) or young adults (YA, orange) expressed as the ratio of CB4856:N2 expression.

more severe phenotypes in the N2 background. Although we de-
tected no difference in phenotype for mutants in either unc-45 or
gld-1 between the N2 and CB4856 backgrounds, we note that
for these two genes, the mutant alleles have weaker loss-of-
function phenotypes than we generated by RNAi, and this might

explain the difference in result. The alternative is that these might
be false positives from our RNAi screen. Our data thus show that
in most cases where we found a difference in RNAi phenotype
between N2 and CB4856, this difference in phenotype can be
conﬁrmed using genetic mutants. This validates our approach
of using RNAi-based screens to investigate the effect of

Figure 3. Mutations in Components of the ETC and in P Granule Regulators Cause More Severe Phenotypes in the N2 Background
We generated CB4856 strains that were homozygous for the hypomorphic nuo-6(qm200) allele or the temperature-sensitive cgh-1(tn691) allele and compared
their phenotypes to N2 strains homozygous for the same alleles.
(A) The hypomorphic nuo-6(qm200) allele causes more severe growth defects in the N2 background. Parallel liquid cultures of N2 or CB4856 parental isolates and
C. Samples were taken after 8 days and
of strains homozygous for the nuo-6(qm200) allele in either the N2 or CB4856 background were set up and grown at 20
analyzed using the worm sorter. The LH panel shows the raw sorter output—N2 and CB4856 populations show similar growth, but N2 nuo-6(qm200) grows more
slowly than CB4856 nuo-6(qm200). The LH boxplot (‘‘MUTANT’’) shows the number of L4 and adult worms in N2 nuo-6(qm200) or CB4856 nuo-6(qm200) strains
relative to the number in the respective wild-type backgrounds. The RH boxplot (‘‘RNAi’’) shows the differences in severity of RNAi phenotypes in our primary
screen (p < 0.01). Finally, the column graph (‘‘EXPRESSION’’) shows the relative expression of nuo-6 in either L4 animals (yellow) or young adults (YA, orange)
expressed as the ratio of CB4856:N2 expression.
(B) The temperature-sensitive cgh-1(tn691) allele causes highly penetrant embryonic lethality in the N2 background. Embryos homozygous for the temperature-
sensitive cgh-1(tn691) allele fail to hatch at 22
C in the N2 background, whereas most CB4856 cgh-1(tn691) embryos hatch normally (LH panel; cyan arrowheads
show dead embryos). This can be quantiﬁed as a difference in the ratio of L2 and L3 larvae to embryos (LH column graph, ‘‘MUTANT,’’ p < 0.01, t test, error bars
denote SD from ﬁve independent measurements). The boxplot (‘‘RNAi’’) shows the differences in severity of RNAi phenotypes in our primary screen (relative
brood size, p < 0.001). Finally, the RH column graph (‘‘EXPRESSION’’) shows relative expression of cgh-1 in L4s (yellow) or young adults (YA, orange) expressed
as the ratio of CB4856:N2 expression.

differences in genetic background on the severity of phenotypes
that arise from inheritance of a mutation.

Many Genes with Different Severity of Loss-of-Function
Phenotype Fall into Distinct Functional Classes
We identiﬁed 120 genes that have more severe phenotypes in
CB4856 and 127 that have more severe phenotypes in the
N2 background; this is due mainly to differences in genetic
background. To gain some insight into the underlying causes
of these differences in phenotypes, we ﬁrst examined whether
these genes tend to encode components of similar molecular
machineries. We manually annotated all 1,353 genes into one
of 19 major functional classes that comprise over 40 more
speciﬁc classes (annotations in Table S1). We identiﬁed three
signiﬁcant enrichments: N2 has more severe phenotypes for

genes involved in the ETC (8/28 genes more severe in N2)
and for genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (8/22 genes
more severe in N2); this latter enrichment is due to genes
that affect P granules (7/11 screened). CB4856 has more se-
vere phenotypes for genes involved in protein synthesis (31/
200 screened). All enrichments are shown in Figure 4A and
listed in Table S3. We note that because some of the functional
classes are broad, they hide more ﬁne-grained enrichments.
For example, we screened ﬁve genes that encode subunits
of the FO, the structure that links muscle cells to the cuticle.
Three of these genes (vab-10, unc-52, and mua-3) have signif-
icantly more severe phenotypes in CB4856, and the other
two (mup-4 and let-805) also have more severe phenotypes
in CB4856 but narrowly miss the statistical cut-off (Z scores
of 1.67 and 1.63, respectively).

Figure 4. Distribution of Functional Classes
of Genes with More Severe Phenotypes in
Either N2 or CB4856 Isolates
(A) All genes were placed into one of 40 functional
classes. The pie charts shows the distribution of
the genes that had more severe RNAi phenotypes
in either N2 or CB4856 in each class. Only classes
with > 20 members are shown; classes that are
signiﬁcantly enriched (p < 0.05; Bonferroni cor-
rected hypergeometric test) are shown as sepa-
rated segments of the pie chart. Enrichments are
all found in Table S3.
(B and C) The N2 isolate is more sensitive to
treatment with KCN, and the CB4856 isolate is
more sensitive to puromycin. Approximately 120
L1 worms were treated with a range of concen-
trations of KCN or puromycin, and their movement
quantiﬁed after 90 min—the graph shows the
fraction of worms that are moving (fractional
mobility score; mean of six replicates; error bars
represent SEM).

(µM)

The enrichments that we found involve many of the genes
that we retested using mutants (Figures 2 and 3)—mutations
in mua-3, unc-52, or vab-10 (all encode FO components) have
more severe phenotypes in CB4856, whereas mutations in
nuo-6 (encodes a component of complex I
in the ETC) or
cgh-1 (an RNA helicase that affects P granules) cause more
severe phenotypes in N2. Furthermore, we can conﬁrm these
data using drugs—N2 is more sensitive to targeting ETC com-
ponents by RNAi and is more severely affected by treatment
with cyanide, an ETC inhibitor, whereas CB4856 is more sensi-
tive to targeting genes encoding protein translational machinery
and is more sensitive to treatment with puromycin, an inhibitor
of protein synthesis (Figures 4B and 4C). We thus suggest
that the same disease-causing mutation may have different
effects in different individuals because of variation in the level
of the requirement for the entire module in which the mutated
gene acts.

Natural Variation in Gene Expression Causes
Differences in Sensitivity to Perturbation in Each
Individual
Almost 20% of the genes we examined have different severity
of loss-of-function phenotypes in two isolates. Why is this?
The great majority of the genes that have different loss-of-func-
tion phenotypes have identical coding sequences in the two
isolates, and we thus focused on whether variation in gene
expression could contribute to the differences in severity of
RNAi and mutant phenotypes in N2 and CB4856. There is ex-
tensive variation in gene expression between N2 and CB4856,
but the functional consequences of this are still
largely un-
known. We used RNA-seq to measure mRNA expression
levels in two stages of the life cycle (the L4 larval stage and
the young adult stage) in both N2 and CB4856 (see Experi-

396 Cell 162, 391–402, July 16, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Inc.

mental Procedures) and used this data-
set to investigate whether variation in
gene expression might affect the severity
of loss-of-function phenotypes.

We ﬁrst focused on the functional modules that showed sys-
tematic differences in loss-of-function phenotypes between
the two isolates. As described above, N2 is more sensitive to
perturbations affecting either the ETC or P granule regulators,
whereas CB4856 is more sensitive to changes in activity of
the protein synthesis machinery or the FO. We ﬁnd that the
ETC and P granule regulators are lower expressed in N2
than in CB4856, whereas components of the FO and the protein
synthesis machinery (speciﬁcally, genes affecting ribosome
biogenesis; see Figure S2A) are lower expressed in CB4856
(Figure 5A). This suggests that variation in gene expression
may affect the severity of mutant phenotypes—the lower the
expression in any individual, the more severe the phenotype.
This is not speciﬁc to RNAi-induced phenotypes because we
see the same sensitization to drugs (e.g., N2 has lower expres-
sion of the ETC and is more sensitive to cyanide; CB4856 has
lower expression of the protein synthesis machinery and is
more sensitive to puromycin; Figures 4B and 4C). Most impor-
tantly, we see that differences in expression levels also correlate
with the severity of the mutant phenotypes of genes—mua-3,
unc-52, vab-10, and unc-32 are lower expressed in CB4856,
and CB4856 has more severe mutant phenotypes for these
genes (Figure 2). Conversely, cgh-1 is lower expressed in N2,
and nuo-6 encodes a subunit of the ETC that is lower expressed
in N2; both have more severe mutant phenotypes in N2 (Fig-
ure 3). The differences in expression are generally subtle (see
Table S1), but at least for cgh-1, the expression differences
are larger (2-fold lower in N2). We ﬁnd that qPCR conﬁrms
the lower expression of cgh-1 in N2 (Figure S2D) and also that
cgh-1 expression is lower in the N2 cgh-1(tn691) strain than
in the CB4856 cgh-1(tn691) strain. This conﬁrms that lower
expression of cgh-1 correlates with increased severity of mutant
phenotype (see Figure 3B).

Our data suggest that natural variation in gene expression
affects the severity of mutant phenotypes—individuals with
lower expression tend to have more severe phenotypes. To
examine this further, we tested whether experimentally altering
expression levels could modulate the severity of mutant phe-
notypes. We examined two functional modules—the FO and
the P granule regulators. CB4856 has lower FO expression and
more severe mutant phenotypes of FO components—if we
reduce the expression of FO components in the higher-express-
ing N2 isolate, does this increase the severity of FO mutant
phenotypes? Conversely, most P granule regulators have lower
expression and more severe phenotypes in the N2 back-
ground—if we reduce expression of P granule regulators, does
this increase the severity of their mutant phenotypes in the
higher-expressing CB4856 background?

We used RNAi to reduce expression of vab-10 or unc-52 in N2
wild-type worms or in N2 strains homozygous for hypomorphic
alleles of either vab-10 or unc-52. Reducing vab-10 expression
greatly increases the severity of the vab-10 mutant phenotype
(Figure 5B), and reducing unc-52 expression increases the
severity of the unc-52 mutant phenotype (Figure 5C). Impor-
tantly, reducing vab-10 expression also increases the severity
of the unc-52 mutant phenotype and vice versa (Figure 5C).
This indicates that the severity of the mutant phenotype of any
speciﬁc gene in any individual can be affected by the level of
either its own expression or the expression of other genes that
act in the same functional module. We ﬁnd very similar results
when we alter expression of P granule regulators (higher ex-
pressed in CB4856)—reducing expression of either mex-3 or
pos-1 signiﬁcantly enhances the severity of the cgh-1 mutant
phenotype in the CB4856 background (see Figure 5D). In all
cases, the combined phenotype is more severe than the simple
additive effect of each perturbation alone.

Together, these data suggest that natural variation in gene
expression can signiﬁcantly affect the severity of mutant pheno-
types. This can either be variation in the expression level of the
mutant gene itself or variation in the expression of other genes
that act in the same functional module. In either case, the trend
is the same—individuals with lower expression tend to have a
more severe mutant phenotype.

Natural Variation in Gene Expression Can Predict the
Severity of Loss-of-Function Phenotypes
A central goal of this study was to improve our ability to predict
the severity of mutant phenotypes in each affected individual. As
described above, we found that variation in gene expression cor-
relates with the severity of mutant phenotypes—lower expres-
sion of a mutant gene or of the functional module in which it
acts results in a more severe loss-of-function phenotype. This
trend is most obvious in the functional modules that are enriched
for phenotypic differences but is still predictive across all genes.
For example, genes that are at least 50% lower expressed in
CB4856 are around twice as likely (1.8 times) to have a more se-
vere phenotype in CB4856 than expected and around half as
likely (0.4 times) to have a more severe phenotype in N2 (see Fig-
ure S2B). However, predicting the relative severity of a mutant
phenotype in two individuals is not our goal—we want to predict
the severity of a mutant phenotype for any single individual rela-

tive to some ‘‘average phenotype’’ for the species, that is, to
answer ‘‘how severe will my phenotype be?’’ To examine this
for the C. elegans species, rather than simply between N2 and
CB4856, we selected two other isolates (AB1 from Australia
and ED3040 from South Africa) that represent additional major
branches of the phylogenetic tree (Andersen et al., 2012).

We used RNA-seq to measure gene expression in these iso-
lates at the L4 larval stage and examined whether the expression
level of any gene in a given isolate predicts the severity of its loss-
of-function phenotype in that isolate. To address this, rather than
screen all 1,400 genes again in all 4 isolates, we focused on the
ETC and used RNAi to compare loss-of-function phenotypes for
35 ETC genes in all 4 isolates. We found that ETC expression
varies between isolates (Figure 6A). This does not reﬂect any
general differences in expression of mitochondrial genes, e.g.,
the 75 mitochondrial ribosome genes are similarly expressed in
3 isolates, and the only exception (ED3040) shows lower expres-
sion of the mitochondrial ribosome and higher levels of ETC (see
Figure S2C). We ﬁnd that the isolates with lower ETC expression
(N2 and AB1) tend to have more severe phenotypes for ETC
genes (Figure 6B). Crucially, this trend is predictive at the sin-
gle-gene level: the lower the expression of any ETC gene in an
isolate, the more severe the phenotype of that gene in that isolate
(Figure 6C). For example, in individuals with at least a 20% differ-
ence in expression level compared to the species average, we
predict with over 85% accuracy their relative severity of pheno-
type (23/27 correct predictions, p < 0.001, binomial test). We
note that these results are unlikely to be an effect of differences
in RNAi efﬁcacy between the isolates—not only did we conﬁrm
the difference in severity of the loss-of-function phenotype of
a component of the ETC between N2 and CB4856 using a ge-
netic mutant (Figure 3A), but we see the predicted differential
sensitivity to cyanide between the isolates, e.g., ED3040 and
CB4856 have higher ETC expression (Figure 6A), less severe
RNAi phenotypes for ETC genes (Figure 6B), and weaker sensi-
tivity to cyanide (Figure 6D), whereas AB1 and N2 have lower
ETC expression (Figure 6A) and more severe RNAi phenotypes
for ETC genes and are more sensitive to cyanide (Figures 6B
and 6D).

Finally, to test whether differences in expression level result in
differences in severity of loss-of-function phenotype in another
biological system, we examined data from a large number of
genome-scale RNAi screens in mammalian cells. We identiﬁed
507 genes that are required for cell growth or viability and tested
whether lower expression of each of these genes in a number of
different cell lines correlates with increased severity of their RNAi
phenotype (see Experimental Procedures for methods and Table
S5 for list of genes). We ﬁnd that the severity of phenotype is
indeed greater in cell lines that have lower expression levels of
the target gene (see Figure 6E and an example for the gene
PAF1 in Figure 6F). Thus, although we have not tested our model
in another whole animal model, or indeed in human populations,
this suggests that the ﬁnding that differences in gene expression
lead to differences in severity of loss-of-function phenotypes is a
general feature of biological networks.

Taken together, our results suggest that one of the major ways
in which variation in genetic background affects the severity of
Mendelian disorders in humans is via variation in the expression

levels of the mutated genes—the variants that affect gene expres-
sion can ultimately affect the severity of the inherited disorder.

DISCUSSION

Two individuals inheriting the same mutation may have very
different severity of mutant phenotypes. Many factors can affect
this, but in this study we focus speciﬁcally on the effect of genetic
background. We used RNAi to knock down the expression of
each of 1,353 genes in two different C. elegans natural isolates
and measured the effect of each knockdown on phenotype.
This set of 1,400 genes comprises the majority of genes that
have a readily detectable mutant phenotype in C. elegans, that
is, the genes whose mutation causes a ‘‘genetic disorder’’ in
worms. The set of genes we are studying is thus broadly analo-
gous to the set of genes whose mutation causes genetic disor-
ders in humans (for example, those described in the OMIM
database). Our conclusions should therefore generalize to the
impact of genetic background on disease severity following the
inheritance of a disease-related variant. We believe our data sup-
port two main conclusions.

First, genetic background frequently has a marked impact on
the phenotypic outcome of a genetic perturbation. Approxi-
mately 20% of genes have different severity of RNAi phenotypes
due to differences in genetic background even when we com-
pare only two individuals. As more individuals are examined
(e.g., when we compared the loss-of-function phenotypes of
components of the ETC in 4 isolates), this impact of genetic
background on variation in loss-of-function phenotypes be-
comes more obvious. Over two-thirds of the genes encoding
components of the ETC showed major differences (at least
50% different to the species average) in phenotype severity in
at least one isolate—these isolates are representatives of major
branches of the phylogenetic tree for C. elegans (Andersen et al.,
2012). These data suggest that the majority of disease-causing
mutations will have phenotypes that are affected by differences
in genetic background.

Second, we ﬁnd that natural variation in gene expression has a
signiﬁcant impact on the severity of mutant phenotypes. The
lower the expression of a gene in any individual, the more likely
it is that the effect of an inherited mutation in that gene will be se-
vere. We also ﬁnd that the mutant phenotype of any gene is
affected by the expression of other genes that act in the same

functional module—again, reduced expression correlates with
increased severity. Importantly, we ﬁnd that personal expression
levels are good predictors of personal severity of mutant pheno-
types. If an individual isolate has at least a 20% lower expression
of a given gene than the species average, we can predict with
over 85% accuracy that the mutant phenotype of that gene will
be more severe in that isolate; conversely, if the isolate has at
least 20% higher expression, this predicts with over 90% accu-
racy that the mutant phenotype will be less severe in that isolate.
Thus, our data suggest that our personal levels of gene expres-
sion provide a strong predictor of the likely effects of the severity
of the phenotype arising from rare variants that drive Mendelian
disorders. This model is illustrated schematically in Figure 7.

We note that there are already indications that variations in
expression levels can modulate severity of Mendelian disorders
in humans. For example, Marfan syndrome is a dominantly in-
herited connective tissue disorder that has a complex array of
symptoms. Marfan syndrome is primarily caused by mutations
in FBN1 (Dietz et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1991)—the C. elegans or-
tholog is mua-3, which we studied here. Just as variations in
mua-3 expression in different isolates of C. elegans affects the
severity of the mua-3 mutant phenotype, so variations in FBN1
levels have been found to correlate with severity of Marfan syn-
drome in humans (Hutchinson et al., 2003). This relationship be-
tween the level of expression and the severity of phenotypes
appears to hold in several other dominantly inherited syndromes
(e.g., retinitis pigmentosa 11; Vithana et al., 2003). It will be
intriguing to see ﬁrst whether this correlation generally holds in
other syndromes, including those that are inherited in a recessive
manner, and second whether variations in expression levels
of other hemidesomosome components such as perlecan
(HSPG2) or dystonin (DST) can also modulate the effect of
FBN1 mutations on Marfan severity as we ﬁnd for variations in
unc-52 and vab-10 in C. elegans.

In summary, our data suggest that most rare variants that
cause Mendelian disorders will have phenotypic outcomes of
different severity in different individuals. We believe that one
way to view the genetics of Mendelian disorders is that there
is a difference between the genetics underlying the risk of
having a Mendelian disorder and the genetics underlying the
severity of the symptoms. The risk is binary, monogenic, and
predictable from genome sequence—one either inherits or
does not inherit a disease-causing mutation like the DF508

(B) Reducing expression of vab-10 increases the severity of the vab-10(e698) mutant phenotype. Wild-type N2 animals or N2 animals homozygous for the vab-
10(e698) allele were fed with bacteria targeting either vab-10 or GFP (control) for 4 days and populations analyzed on a worm sorter. Almost all of the initial added
L1 worms developed to adulthood (TOF > 400) in the N2 wild-type animals either with RNAi targeting GFP (control; black) or vab-10 (cyan). The same is true for
vab-10(e698) animal control cultures (yellow); however, vab-10(e698) animals fed with dsRNAs targeting vab-10 (green) grew more slowly, and few reached
adulthood. Red circles mark median TOF and extinctions in each plot.
(C) Altering expression of FO components affects severity of FO mutant phenotypes. Wild-type N2 animals or N2 strains homozygous for either vab-10(e698) or
unc-52(e669su250) mutant alleles were exposed to bacteria expressing dsRNAs targeting either GFP (control), vab-10, or unc-52. The percentage of L1 animals
that failed to develop to adulthood or that had severe movement defects was scored after 4 days.
(D) Altering expression of P granule regulators affects severity of cgh-1 mutant phenotypes. We assessed the effect of targeting different P granule regulators
using RNAi in four different worm strains: N2 and CB4856 wild-type isolates and N2 and CB4856 strains each homozygous for the temperature-sensitive
cgh-1(tn691) allele. In each case, 15 L1 worms were fed with dsRNAs targeting either GFP (control), pos-1, or mex-3 for 4 days at 20
C, and brood sizes were
measured using the worm sorter and expressed relative to brood sizes in control cultures. The effect of the cgh-1(tn691) allele on brood size is greater in the N2
background than in the CB4856 background (purple lines). Importantly, whereas targeting pos-1 or mex-3 has only a weak effect on brood size in the CB4856
wild-type isolate, it has a strong defect on brood size in the CB4856 strain with the cgh-1(tn691) allele (green lines). All marked differences are signiﬁcant at
p < 0.01. Error bars denote SD from three independent measurements

Figure 6. Differences in Gene Expression
Predict the Relative Severity of Loss-of-
Function Phenotypes
(A) Expression levels of the ETC in four isolates.
mRNA levels in L4 larvae were measured in all four
isolates using RNA-seq. The expression level of
any gene is expressed relative to the average
expression of that gene across all four isolates.
The plot shows expression levels of genes en-
coding ETC components; all isolates differ at p <
0.05 (paired t test) except AB1 and N2. See also
Figure S2 for more expression analyses.
(B) Severity of RNAi phenotypes of ETC compo-
nents in four isolates. We used RNAi to target each
of 35 components of the ETC in all isolates and
measured the effect on brood size. The RNAi
phenotype of each gene in any isolate is expressed
relative to the average RNAi phenotype of that
gene across all four isolates and plotted in the
box-and-whisker plot. All
isolates have different
severity of phenotypes (p < 0.05, paired t test)
except AB1 and N2.
(C) Differences in gene expression predict differ-
ences in severity of mutant phenotypes. Thirty-ﬁve
genes encoding components of the ETC were
placed into bins based on their relative expression
in any isolate: 20% or more lower than the average
expression ( 20%); 10%–20% lower
( 10%);
10%–20% higher (10%); and 20% or more higher
than average expression (20%). In each bin, the
box-and-whisker plot shows the distribution of
severity of RNAi phenotypes; the RNAi phenotype
of each gene in any single isolate is expressed
relative to the average phenotype of that gene
across all four isolates.
(D) Sensitivity of different C. elegans isolates
to KCN treatment. Approximately 120 ED3040,
CB4856, N2, and AB1 L1 worms were treated with
different concentrations of KCN, and their move-
ment quantiﬁed after 90 min—the graph shows
the fraction of worms that were moving (fractional
mobility score; data are mean of eight assays; error bars represent SEM). AB1 and N2 are more sensitive to KCN than CB4856 and ED3040 (p < 0.01, t test).
(E) Correlation between expression level and severity of RNAi phenotypes in mammalian cell lines. We identiﬁed 507 human genes that are required for normal cell
growth (see Experimental Procedures) and tested whether their relative expression in a range of 18 pancreatic and ovarian cell lines predicted their relative
severity of RNAi phenotype in each cell line. Here we show the distribution of correlations between the severity of RNAi phenotype and the expression level for the
507 genes across a panel of 18 pancreatic and ovarian cell lines (see Experimental Procedures). The mean correlation is  0.20, which is signiﬁcantly lower than
zero (p < 2.2 3 10

genetically complex and is at least in part due to variants that
affect gene expression. These ﬁndings may ultimately allow us
to predict the phenotypic differences between individuals who
inherit the same Mendelian mutation and, more broadly, to un-
derstand how the interplay between rare variants and modi-
ﬁers affects the phenotype of any individual.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Strain Maintenance and Worm Handling



C. elegans strains were maintained at 20
C on NGM agar plates seeded with
OP50 E.coli according to standard protocols (Stiernagle, 2006). All strains
were supplied by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC), University of
Minnesota, USA.

RNAi Screening and Data Processing

RNAi by feeding was carried out as described in Lehner et al. (2006). Genes
were screened in triplicates in each RNAi screen, and three biological re-
peats were carried out. Strains were also grown with non-targeting control
bacteria (bacteria expressing dsRNA-targeting GFP); over 100 replicates of
these were screened in each experiment. Each well was analyzed using
the Reﬂex module of a Union Biometria worm sorter to acquire the time of
ﬂight (TOF) and Extinction (EXT) for each object—bubble counts were re-
moved using custom Perl scripts. We measured three parameters for each
well—the number of adults, the brood size, and a measure of the rate of
growth of the progeny population (the ratio between the number of objects
with TOF below 75 [embryos and L1 larvae] and objects with TOF > 75
and < 350 [L2 and L3 worms]). To compute Z scores for differences in any
parameter between the isolates, we used the distribution of the differences
in the controls.
Genes were classed as having more severe phenotypes in either isolate as
follows. If the Z score for differences in brood size was either <  2 or > 2, genes

Figure 7. Natural Variation in Gene Expression Results in Variation in
Severity of Mutant Phenotypes
In this schematic, we illustrate how natural variation in gene expression can
lead to differences in the severity of mutant phenotypes. Lower expression
either of a mutated gene (‘gene A*’) or of other components of the functional
module in which that gene acts (‘gene B’) can equally result in a more severe
mutant phenotype. We also suggest that this variation in expression levels only
has a signiﬁcant effect on phenotype in the context of a mutant allele. In (A),
natural variation in gene expression has little or no effect on phenotype in the
context of wild-type alleles; in (B), the same variation in gene expression
modulates the severity of the mutant phenotype.

were annotated as being more severe in either N2 or CB4856, respectively.
However, if brood sizes were < 10% of control levels in both isolates, we
required a greater signiﬁcance of z <  2.5 or z > 2.5. If there was no signiﬁcant
difference in brood size, we next examined the Z scores for differences in
growth—if z <  2 or z > 2, we annotated genes as being more severe in
either N2 or CB4856, respectively. To reduce false positives, we also required
that brood-size differences did not contradict the growth severity, i.e., we
only scored differences in severity if z (growth) > 2 AND z (brood) > 0 or z
(growth) <  2 AND z (brood) < 0.

Enrichment Analysis

Genes were manually annotated into each of 19 major functional classes (that
comprise 40 more speciﬁc functional classes) using all available gene informa-
tion in WormBase. An enrichment analysis was performed to identify which of
the 19 major functional classes were under- or over-represented for genes with
more severe RNAi phenotypes in N2 or CB4856, and p values were calculated
based on a hypergeometric test and Bonferroni-corrected for multiple hypoth-
esis testing.

Construction of CB4856 Strains Carrying Mutant Alleles

All mutant alleles used were initially isolated in an N2 background. To generate
CB4856 background strains carrying these same alleles, we crossed CB4856
and the N2 strain carrying the mutant of interest. We then carried out multiple
rounds of backcrossing with CB4856 (in all cases, at least ﬁve rounds of back-
crossing) following by at least ﬁve generations of selﬁng before isolating
CB4856 lines that were homozygous for the mutation of interest. Multiple
CB4856 lines were generated for each gene tested; results are reported for
a single representative line.

Using Expression to Predict Relative Fitness in Human Cell Lines

Gene-expression and siRNA knockdown data for human cell lines were ob-
tained from the COLT database (http://colt.ccbr.utoronto.ca/cancer/) and
analyzed based on Z scores (Marcotte et al., 2012) and on Bayes Factors
(Hart et al., 2014). We identiﬁed genes that are required for normal cell
growth by ﬁtting a logistic regression model from the COLT RNAi Bayes Fac-
tors in different cell lines to a set of genes whose orthologs are known to be
required for viability in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae. When tested against the
training set, we observed a bimodal distribution of response scores. We
considered the upper peak to be genes that affect cell growth or viability
and identiﬁed genes likely to be drawn from that distribution using a
Gaussian mixture model with a cutoff probability of 0.95, giving us 507
genes. We calculated the Pearson correlation between expression and
severity of RNAi phenotype across different cell
lines for each one of the
507 genes we identiﬁed and examined the entire distribution for evidence
of global correlation.

Acute Effect of Potassium Cyanide (KCN) or Puromycin Treatment

L1 larvae in M9 buffer were exposed to a range of concentrations of KCN or
puromycin. For each concentration, six replicate wells were analyzed each
containing 120 worms. After 90 min at 20
C, each well was photographed
twice at a 500 ms interval under bright-ﬁeld illumination. A fractional paralysis
score was determined by counting the number of worms that did not move be-
tween the consecutive images.
