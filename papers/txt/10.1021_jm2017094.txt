ABSTRACT: Using structure-based design, two novel series of highly potent biaryl amine
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors have been discovered. These series
contain an H-bond acceptor,
in a shifted position compared with previously disclosed
compounds, and an adjacent H-bond donor, resulting in a bidentate interaction with the
Ser212 residue of MEK1. The most potent compound identiﬁed, 1 (G-894), is orally active in
in vivo pharmacodynamic and tumor xenograft models.

■ INTRODUCTION

The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase
signaling pathway is one of the most promising targets for a
new wave of molecularly targeted antitumor agents.1
Constitutive activation of the extracellular regulated kinase
(ERK) cascade, through oncogenic forms of Ras and mutations
in B-Raf, has been observed in lung, colon, pancreas, kidney,
and ovary primary human tumor samples.2 Similarly, hyper-
activity by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases such as human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) leads to increased
signaling through the ERK pathway.3 Research eﬀorts in recent
years have uncovered a variety of inhibitors of Raf, MEK, and
ERK kinases as potential antitumor agents.4

MEK is a crucial node in the ERK MAPK pathway: the only
known downstream targets of MEK1/2 are ERK1/2. This has
led to particularly intense eﬀorts to discover inhibitors of this
target, and there are now 13 MEK inhibitors at some stage of
clinical evaluation for the treatment of cancer, with two others
having been withdrawn.5,6 The ﬁrst MEK inhibitors to progress
past phase I clinical trials were 2 (AZD6244/Selumetinib,
Figure 1)7−9 and PD325901,10 both of which were progressed
to phase II studies as single agents for the treatment of a variety
tumor types. Studies with 2 as a single agent and in
of
combination with other antitumor agents are continuing.11 The
most advanced MEK inhibitor is GSK1120212,12 which began a
phase III trial in BRAF V600E positive melanoma patients in
late 2010.

Although MEK inhibition alone is expected to provide
signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt, there is considerable evidence
for synergistic combination with other targeted agents. For
example, concerted MEK and PI3K inhibition provides

synergistic inhibition of
tumor growth in basal-like breast
cancer models.13 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that in
K-Ras mutant cell lines, Raf inhibition primes wild-type Raf to
activate the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, providing a clear rational
for combination therapy with MEK inhibitors.14

Allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitors15 are particularly discrim-
inating kinase inhibitors. These compounds form a tertiary
complex with the MEK enzyme and the ATP binding site and
are thus uncompetitive.16,17 The binding site for so-called type
III kinase inhibitors is proximal to ATP and results in high

speciﬁcity for the target enzyme. It has been postulated that this
allosteric “MEK pocket” may be present in other kinases.18

Examination of structural features of inhibitors disclosed in
the patent literature reveals that the allosteric binding pocket of
MEK1 is highly discriminating in its aﬃnity for drug molecules,
resulting in low structural diversity.15,19 The structures of seven
compounds that have entered the clinic have been disclosed: all
are biaryl amines, by far the most common class of MEK
inhibitor. The potency of these inhibitors is postulated to
depend on three pharmacophoric elements (Figure 2).16 The

ﬁrst of these is a “B-ring”, which occupies the lipophilic pocket
formed by Leu118, Ile126, Val127, Ile141, Met143, Phe129,
Phe209, and Val211, an important feature of which is para-
substitution with a lipophilic polarizable atom or group capable
of forming an interaction with the carbonyl of Val127. Where
this atom is a halogen, the interaction is termed a halogen
bond.20,21 The second feature is a polar group which can
interact with the terminal phosphate of ATP and Lys97,
typically a hydroxamate, but sometimes an amide, reverse
sulfonamide, or sulfonyl urea.22 The third feature is an H-bond
acceptor, which is suitably juxtaposed to Ser212. The strength

Article

of this H-bond acceptor23 and position relative to the aniline
and hydroxamate are determined by the “A-ring” to which these
moieties are attached. It has been proposed that increasing the
strength of the Ser212/H-bond acceptor interaction results in
greater tolerance in the other pharmacophoric elements.24
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In our search for additional MEK inhibitors, we utilized a
computer-aided drug design (CADD) driven approach
leveraging key information from the X-ray crystal structure
(2.7 Å resolution) of 3 (G-925, Figure 1), a compound from
our ﬁrst series of novel inhibitors25 which was optimized to give
the orally eﬃcacious analogue 4 (G-573).26 From 2-D overlay
of 2 and 3, it was noticed that the two A ring systems position
the H-bond acceptor diﬀerently. Additionally, it was realized
that for a 6,5-heterobicyclic system fusion of the ﬁve-membered
ring toward the B-ring, in the opposite sense to 2, together with
movement of the acceptor round one position, placed the key
pharmocophoric elements described above in remarkably
similar position to 3. An H-bond donor was added next to
the acceptor, as it was postulated that this position would be
proximal to the carbonyl of Ser212 resulting in the design of 1
(G-894, Figure 1). This designed compound is fundamentally
diﬀerent to all six-membered aryl and 6,5-fused biaryl amine
MEK inhibitors disclosed in the literature in that the putative
H-bond acceptor is not positioned on the six-membered ring
meta to the aniline. Modeling of the indazole 1 in the 3/MEK1
protein structure was performed using docking (Figure 3, A)
and manual placement (Figure 3, B), as docking algorithms
underestimate the iodine Val127 interaction. The docked pose
shows bidentate Ser212 interaction, but the aniline ∼1.3 Å out
of the lipophilic pocket compared with 3. In the manual
overlay, the indazole acceptor was still appropriately positioned
near Ser212, with the NH donor shifted slightly from the
Ser212 carbonyl to a distance of 3.0 Å. Although neither pose
of 1 was ideal, the protein movement required to enable all
desired contacts is minimal.

It should be noted that it is not possible to achieve a formal
bidentate Ser212 interaction using monoaryl or 6,5-fused biaryl
MEK inhibitor scaﬀolds which have been previously disclosed.
The possibility of identifying a MEK inhibitor making such a
bidentate interaction with Ser212, which could lead to
increased aﬃnity, led us to target the synthesis of 1.

The desired 4-phenylamino-5-carboxylic acid core was
synthesized following the route outlined in Scheme 1.
Commercially available 2-bromo-4-ﬂuorobenzoic acid was
converted to the tert-butyl ester 5 under standard conditions.
Regiospeciﬁc metalation with LDA followed by DMF quench
gave aldehyde 6. Cyclization of the ortho-ﬂuoro aldehyde 6 to

carboxylic acid 10a. Installation of the hydroxamate side-chain
could then be achieved via a coupling reaction with vinyl
hydroxylamine 11a followed by acid-mediated deprotection.
Bromo analogue 12 was prepared similarly from intermediate 9
using NBS rather
the
halogentation step. Diol analogue 13 was also prepared from
acid intermediate 10a.
In a biochemical homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence
(HTRF) assay, 1 was found to be ∼2.5-fold more potent than 4
(Table 1), demonstrating that this designed analogue is a
potent inhibitor of MEK. Potency was further assessed in
HCT116 (K-Ras mutant human colorectal carcinoma cell line)
and A375 (BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma cell line)
cell lines, determining both the inhibition of ERK phosphor-
ylation and cell proliferation. In these assays, 1 is consistently
∼10-fold more potent than 4. Bromo analogue 12 is less potent
than 1, as would be expected by reduction in strength of the
Val127 halogen bond. However, 12 is equipotent with 4 in
cellular assays, again demonstrating the excellent potency
facilitated by the indazole scaﬀold. Results for 4 and 13 show a
direct comparison between the azabenzofuran and indazole
scaﬀolds. The indazole 13 is marginally more potent in the

HTRF assay, equipotent in A375 cells, but much more potent
in HCT116 cellular assays. The improved potency in cellular
but not biochemical assays of the indazole compared with
azabenzofurans is intriguing. As all of these compounds are
uncompetitive with respect to ATP, it is understandable that
cellular potency is greater than biochemical potency due to high
intracellular concentrations of ATP. As the biochemical assay
used a constitutively activated kinase construct, cellular data
were taken to be more indicative of true potency. Diﬀerences in
proliferation values between the two cell lines used are most
likely due to diﬀerential sensitivity, as the shift between A375
and HCT116 cell lines is consistently 8−10-fold. 1 shows high
speciﬁcity for MEK inhibition with <40% inhibition at 1 μM

An X-ray cocrystal structure (2.7 Å resolution) of 1 with

mode of binding and bidentate interaction with Ser212 (Figure
4, modeled hydrogen atoms shown for clarity) and a structure
consistent with the manual overlay shown above (Figure 3,

Information). Bioavailability in mouse at 25 mg/kg was higher
perhaps due to saturation of clearance mechanisms. The bromo
analogue 12 was found to have higher clearance in rat than the
iodo analogue despite lower lipophilicity, and bioavailability was
found to be low. Diol hydroxamate 13 was not progressed into
PK as it exhibited low MDCK cell permeability (A:B 2.0, B:A
7.1 × 10−6 cm/s eﬄux ratio 3.5). The azabenzofuran 4 has
much lower clearance and higher oral exposure than 1 in mice.
Despite low oral exposure in rodents. the high potency of 1
in cellular assays warranted further
this
compound in an eﬃcacy study. Gratifyingly, when dosed orally
in nude HCT-116 tumor-bearing mice, 1 exhibited substantially
greater eﬃcacy at 5 mg/kg than 4 at the same dose (Figure 5),

with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) approaching stasis (94%).
The 5 mg/kg dose was well tolerated with no loss of body
weight compared with vehicle (data not shown). At the 25 and
75 mg/kg doses, 5 and 10 out of 10 partial responses were
observed but ∼10% loss of body weight was noted at the higher
dose. This improved eﬃcacy compared with 4 can be largely
attributed to increased potency. The free fraction for 1 in mice
is ∼2-fold higher than for 4, which is perhaps within the error
of the experiment, whereas the exposure of 1 is ∼10-fold
higher. Eﬃcacy was found to correlate with inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation in a separate pharmacodynamic experiment: a
single dose of 1 at 25 mg/kg led to maximal inhibition of pERK

carbonyl of Val127, an appropriate distance for formation of a
halogen bond. With the aniline positioned ideally for lipophilic
contacts and halogen bond, the indazole is able to make a
donor−acceptor
interaction with Ser212. The interatom
distance for both the H-bonding atom pairs is 2.58 Å with
angles of 134° and 142° for the indazole N Ser NH and
indazole NH Ser CO interactions. Comparison with the crystal
structure of 3 shows a small but signiﬁcant
induced-ﬁt
movement of Ser212 (when compared with the highly
conserved positions of other residues in the pocket) which
allows the three pharmacophoric elements to interact as
desired: a shift of 0.48 Å is observed for the carbonyl oxygen.
The shift in Ser212 to accommodate the donor−acceptor pair
of 1 indicates that the postulated bidentate interaction exists
and most adequately explains the potency of this compound.
When dosed in rats, the rate of clearance of 1 was found to
be moderate ∼2/3 liver blood ﬂow (Table 2) and oral exposure
and bioavailability were low. Similar results were found in mice
where clearance was approximately equal to liver blood ﬂow
and oral exposure (AUC) was low. Low oral bioavailability in
rat was attributed to high liver extraction ratio and poor
solubility (solubility 0.08 mg/mL (pH 6.5), 0.18 mg/mL
(FASSIF); measured MDCK permeability was moderate to
high with low eﬄux (A:B 9.9 B:A 13.8 × 10−6 cm/s; ratio: 1.4).
Analysis of plasma samples following oral dosing in rats showed
that glucoronidation and cleavage of the hydroxamate to acid
were the major
routes of metabolism (see Supporting

(∼70% of control values) through 8 h (see Supporting
Information).

In an attempt to optimize the PK/potency balance, a number
of analogues were prepared from acid intermediate 10a that
investigated variation of the hydroxamate group (Table 3).
These analogues were assessed using in vitro or in vivo
experiments as appropriate. Cyclopropylmethyl (14) and ethyl
(15) hydroxamate analogues were found to be signiﬁcantly less
potent than 1, and both showed no oral exposure when dosed
at 5 mg/kg in rats (data not shown). Replacement of the
hydroxamate with amides was not tolerated: 16 exhibited an
IC50 of >10 μM in the HTRF assay, and the azetidinol analogue
17 possessed very weak activity. In general, it appears that the
indazole scaﬀold, despite enabling a bidentate donor−acceptor
interaction with Ser212,
is less tolerant of changes to the
hydroxamate compared with previously disclosed pyridone
monocyclic inhibitors.24 This is perhaps due to less ﬂexibility in
positioning of the donor−acceptor element of the indazole
compared with the monodentate pyridone.

Owing to the diﬃculty in balancing potency, metabolic
stability, and oral bioavailability in the indazole series, our
thoughts turned to other scaﬀolds that take advantage of our
discovery of a bidentate Ser212 interaction and movement in
the position of the H-bond acceptor. It has been postulated that
the CH of some ﬁve-membered heterocycles can act as a weak
H-bond donor.27,28 Additionally,
it is likely that our earlier
azabenzofuran template is positioned appropriately to make a
similar interaction. Replacing the fused pyrazole ring of 1 with
an isothiazole would provide a system able to make a C−H···O
donor−acceptor interaction with Ser212 with reduced polarity.
It was considered that the lower energy of H-bond interaction
may be compensated for by a reduced desolvation penalty
compared with the indazole.

The synthesis of targeted analogues 18 and 19 (Scheme 2)
depended on preparation of a benzoisothiazole with an
unprecedented substitution pattern. The required intermediate,
tetra-substituted derivative 22, was prepared in two steps from
ester 20 via radical bromination followed by oxidation with

4598

trimethylamine oxide and DMSO. Regiospeciﬁc SNAr displace-
ment at the 3-position with phenylmethanethiol was achieved
using potassium tert-butoxide at low temperature to furnish the
desired compound 23. The isothiazole ring was formed
following a two-step procedure,29 providing the 6,7-disubsti-
tuted benzoisothiazole scaﬀold 24. The 2-ﬂuoro-4-iodoaniline
was introduced through SNAr displacement of the remaining
ﬂuorine atom using LHMDS at low temperature, giving the
aniline ester 25. Subsequent steps were carried out as for the
indazole analogues.
Pleasingly, hydroxyethyl hydroxamate analogue 18 showed
excellent potency in all assays and is only ∼2−3-fold less potent
indazole analogue 1 in P-ERK and cell
than the direct
proliferation assays (Table 4). These data prove that a formal

H-bond donor on this novel 6,5-fused scaﬀold is not necessary
for excellent potency. Diol analogue 19 is 2-fold less potent
than indazole analogue 13 in the HTC116 cell proliferation
assay and equipotent in A375 cells.

Calculated physicochemical properties for selected com-
pounds with varying A-rings are shown in Table 5. These data
show that cell shifts for both the benzoisothiazole and indazole
analogues are much reduced compared with azabenzofuran
analogue 3. Azabenzofuran analogue 4, which has a less polar
hydroxamate substituent and an A-ring substituted with
ﬂuorine, has more similar cell shifts to both benzoisothiazoles
and indazole 13. High donor and acceptor count (>11) is the
strongest correlate with increased cell shift; compare 1 and 13
and 3 and 4, presumably due to reduced membrane
permeability. This diﬀerence is more marked in A375 cells.
From these data,
the indazole and
benzoisothiazole scaﬀolds achieve increased cell potency by
more optimal positioning of polar functionality.
When dosed in rats, compound 19 showed much reduced
clearance and ∼5-fold higher oral exposure compared with 1
(Table 6). However, as 19 is highly plasma protein bound, the
unbound clearance is no better than for 1 (1875 cf. 923 mL/
min/kg) and unbound oral AUC is very similar (0.046 cf. 0.040
μM·h). As in the absence of active transport or restricted

permeability the unbound fraction of drugs drives eﬃcacy, it
was concluded that compound 19 does not improve on 1 and it
was not tested further. Compound 18 was not progressed
further, as it is a potent CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibitor.

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, using structure-based design leveraging key
information from a previously disclosed azabenzofuran series,
we have discovered novel allosteric MEK inhibitors which,
partly through strengthened interaction with Ser212, display
improved potency in cellular assays. The most potent
compound discovered, indazole 1, is eﬃcacious at low doses
in a human tumor xenograft model.
The relative contributions to potency of the C−H and N−H
H-bond donors in the benzoisothiazole and indazole scaﬀolds
cannot be determined from comparison of the biochemical and
cellular data presented here. However, it is clear that the H-
bond acceptor of both these scaﬀolds is ideally positioned and
facilitates excellent potency in either case. This result is at odds
with previous evidence from the literature which suggests that
the H-bond acceptor should be positioned next to the ring
junction on 6,5-fused scaﬀolds, as in 2. In this regard, the
topology of MEK inhibitors such as 1 and 19 is unique.
Additionally, taken together, the data on benzofuran, indazole,
and benzoisothiazole biaryl amine allosteric MEK inhibitors

In Vitro Methods for the Determination of MEK Inhibition,
Cellular Levels of Phospho-ERK, and Cell Proliferation. MEK1
Inhibition Assay. A homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence assay
(HTRF) was used to test
inhibition of kinase activity. A
constitutively active MEK1 was obtained from Invitrogen and was
tested at a concentration of 15 nM with 50 μM ATP, 50 nM unactive
ERK1, and the test compound in a 25 mM HEPES buﬀer, pH 7.5,
containing 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, and 0.1 mg/mL Triton X 100. The kinase assay was
carried out for 30 min at 25 °C and was terminated by the addition of
EDTA. HTRF reagents (CisBiol) were added and time-resolved
ﬂuorescence was read using a Wallac Victor V (Perkin-Elmer). IC50
values quoted are the result of at least two separate determinations
where the results were within 2-fold of eachother and were calculated
using the KLﬁt software package (version 2.0.5).

Assay for Cellular Levels of Phospho-ERK. Cells (HCT116 or
A375) were seeded at 26700/well into collagen-coated 96-well plates
and were incubated overnight under normal tissue culture conditions.
The following day, the cells were exposed to MEK inhibitors for 2 h.
At the end of this time, the cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized by
incubation in 2% formaldehyde for 45 min followed by 100% ice-cold
methanol for 10 min. The ﬁxed and permeabilized cells were washed
with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in Tris buﬀered saline plus Tween
20 (TBST) for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of this time, the blocking
solution was replaced with an antiphospho-ERK antibody raised in
rabbit (New England Biolabs) at a dilution of 1:1000 made in blocking
solution and the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by
washing and incubation with antirabbit-Ig− Alexa Flour 488
(Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking solution for 2 h at
the cells were incubated with 1.5 μM
rt. Following washing,
propridium iodide for 2 h in the dark and read on a high content
imager (Acumen, TTP LabTech) in the red and green channels to
measure P-ERK content and cell number. EC50 values quoted are the
result of at least two separate determinations, where the results were
within 2-fold of eachother and were calculated using the KLﬁt software
package (version 2.0.5).

Cell Proliferation Assay. Cells (HCT116 or A375) were seeded at
26700/well
into collagen-coated 96-well plates and were incubated
overnight under normal tissue culture conditions. The following day,
the cells were exposed to MEK inhibitors for 72 h under normal tissue
culture conditions. At the end of this time, the cells were equilibrated
to rt and mixed 1:1 with Cell Titer Glo reagent prepared as indicated
by the supplier (Promega),
followed by a 10 min incubation.
Luminescence was read using a TopCount (Perkin-Elmer). EC50
values quoted are the result of at least two separate determinations,
where the results were within 2-fold of eachother and were calculated
using the KLﬁt software package (version 2.0.5).

Molecular Modeling Methods. All molecular modeling experiments
were carried out using software from Schrödinger Inc. The crystal
structure of MEK1 (extracted from the cocrystal with 3, PDB
reference 3V01) was prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard in
Maestro (Protein Preparation Wizard, Schrödinger, LLC, New York,
NY), which assigns bond orders, adds hydrogen atoms, deletes water
molecules, and generates appropriate protonation states. The prepared
protein structure was then minimized using OPLS2001 (until the rmsd
reached 0.3 Å) and used to generate the receptor grids for docking.
The binding site was deﬁned using the native ligand and selecting the
option “docking ligands similar in size”. The ligand structures were
built in Maestro and prepared for docking using LigPrep 2.0 (LigPrep,
Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). The docking experiments were
carried out with Glide 4.030 in Extra Precision mode, using the default
parameters setting. The top ﬁve docking poses for each ligand were
selected and visually inspected.
X-Ray Crystal Structure Determination Method. Cloning and
Expression. The truncated (residues 63−393)MEK1 was cloned from
a wt MEK1 full length construct via PCR and subcloned into pET24b
(Novagen) as previously described.16 The recombinant MEK1 was
expressed in Escherichia coli (Rosetta 2 pLys S) and grown in Ultra
Yield Flasks (Thomson Instrument Company) TB media/MOPS/
glycerol at 37 °C to an O.D. of 1 (600 nm). The cells were then placed
at 16 °C and induced after 30 min with 0.5 mM IPTG and allowed to
grow an additional 18 h.

Protein Puriﬁcation and Crystallization. MEK1 was puriﬁed using
Cobalt immobilized metal aﬃnity resin (TALON), ion exchange, and
size exclusion chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 15
mg/mL and incubated with 10-fold molar excess inhibitor plus 1 mM
MgAMP-PNP before crystallization. MEK1 crystals grew from hanging
drop vapor diﬀusion using 12% w/v PEG 8000, 0.4 M NH4H2PO4,
and 0.1 M HEPES pH 6.9 at 18 °C. MEK1 crystals belonging to the
space group P62 and unit cell a = 81 Å and c = 129 Å were previously
described.16

Structure Determination and Reﬁnement. Synchrotron data was
collected at
the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 5.0.2.
Diﬀraction data to 2.7 Å at 100 K was processed using HKL200031
suite of programs. Molecular
replacement was performed using
MOLREP in CCP432 suite with PDB accession code 1S9J as the
starting model. Reﬁnement was conducted using REFMAC5.2. The
reﬁnement statistics are summarized in the Supporting Information.
