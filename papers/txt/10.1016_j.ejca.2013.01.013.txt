Abstract Objective: This is the ﬁrst clinical study of the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD8330
(ARRY-424704). This phase I study deﬁned the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assessed
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD8330 in patients
with advanced malignancies.
Methods: Patients with refractory cancer or cancer with no standard therapy received either
once-daily (OD) or twice-daily (BID) oral AZD8330 on day 1 followed by a 7-day washout
period and continuous dosing from day 8. The starting dose was 0.5 mg with dose escalations
in subsequent cohorts until a non-tolerated dose was reached.
Results: Eighty-two patients received AZD8330 across 11 cohorts. The most frequent
AZD8330-related adverse events were acneiform dermatitis (13/82, 16%), fatigue (11/82,
13%), diarrhoea (11/82, 13%) and vomiting (9/82, 11%). Four patients experienced dose-lim-
iting toxicities: mental status changes (40 mg OD; 2/9 patients and 60 mg OD; 1/3) and rash
(20 mg BID; 1/9). The MTD was deﬁned as 20 mg BID. AZD8330 exposure increased approx-
imately proportionally with dose across the dose range 0.5–60 mg OD. Dose-dependent mod-
ulation of phosphorylated ERK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was observed
at doses P3 mg. One patient had a partial response and thirty-two (39%) had stable disease,
with a duration >3 months in 22 patients, assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.

1. Introduction

MAPK ERK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 are essential
enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase
pathway that regulate cellular proliferation. Deregula-
tion of this pathway occurs frequently in a variety of
tumours and promotes cell survival and tumour growth.
The only known substrates of MEK1/2 are the extracel-
lular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2; MEK
inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic target
in cancer.

Several MEK inhibitors are currently being investi-
gated clinically in various tumour types.1–5 AZD8330
(ARRY-424704) is a potent, selective, uncompetitive
MEK1/2 inhibitor, with a half-maximum inhibitory con-
centration (IC50) of 7 nM.6 In tumour xenograft models,
AZD8330 demonstrated dose-dependent tumour growth
inhibition of approximately 90% at tolerated doses
(1.0 mg/kg once daily [OD]).6 These preclinical results
suggest that AZD8330 may provide eﬀective tumour
growth inhibition with a favourable tolerability proﬁle.

This is the ﬁrst clinical study of AZD8330, designed
to determine its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic
(PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) proﬁle in patients
with advanced malignancies.

2. Patients and methods

2.1. Patients

dose of AZD8330 (AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Chesh-
ire, UK) on day 1 followed by a 7-day washout period
and continuous OD or BID dosing, respectively, from
day 8. Patients were not permitted food 2 h preceding
and 1 h following dosing. The
starting dose of
AZD8330 was 0.5 mg; subsequent cohorts received an
increased dose of AZD8330 determined by the Safety
Review Committee (SRC), until a non-tolerated dose
was reached. A non-tolerated dose was deﬁned as the
dose at which P2/6 patients in a cohort experienced a
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 35 days of com-
mencing treatment. Patients remained on treatment
until disease progression and for as long as they contin-
ued to derive clinical beneﬁt. All patients were followed
until withdrawal of consent or the end of the study
(6 months following ﬁrst treatment dose).

2.4. End-points

The primary objective of the study was to assess the
safety and tolerability of AZD8330. Secondary objec-
tives were: to determine the PK proﬁle of AZD8330 fol-
lowing both single and multiple dosing, to investigate
the eﬀect of AZD8330 on pERK in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to explore relationships
between PK and PD parameters. Assessment of
AZD8330 eﬃcacy was an exploratory end-point.

2.5. Safety

Eligible patients were P18 years of age, with a con-
ﬁrmed diagnosis of cancer refractory to standard ther-
apy or for which no standard therapy exists. Other
inclusion criteria included a World Health Organization
performance status of 0–2 and adequate renal, hepatic
and cardiac function.

2.2. Trial design

This was an open-label, phase I dose-escalation study
conducted in two centres in the USA and one centre in
Norway (NCT00454090). Enrolment was from March
2007 to April 2010. All patients provided written
informed consent and the study was conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All adverse events (AEs) were recorded from the time
of informed consent until 30 days after study treatment
was discontinued, using Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3. General safety
monitoring information is provided in the Supplemen-
tary section. AEs were followed to resolution where
possible.

A DLT was deﬁned as any CTCAE grade P3 AE
unrelated to underlying disease; continuous dose inter-
ruption for >2 weeks for any toxicity considered to be
possibly related to AZD8330; or any toxicity considered
to be clinically signiﬁcant by the investigator, within
35 days of ﬁrst dose. The maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was deﬁned as the last dose tested below the
non-tolerated dose in six evaluable patients.

2.3. Interventions

2.6. PK analysis

Eligible patients in each cohort (of six to nine evalu-
able patients) received either an OD or twice-daily (BID)

Serial venous blood samples (2 mL) were taken pre-
dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (for 0.5–1.5 mg only),

day 15 taken prior to day 16 dose) on days 1 and 15
and 48 h post-dose (day 1 only, 3–60 mg). Sparse sam-
pling was performed on days 22 and 29 at pre-dose,
0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h post-dose.

The PK parameters were derived using non-compart-
mental methods with WinNonlinÒ Professional version
5.2 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, California).
Additional PK methods are provided in the Supplemen-
tary section.

2.7. PD analysis

Blood samples (2  2 mL) were taken pre-dose, 1.5,
4, 8 and 24 h post-dose on day 1 for pERK analysis in
PBMCs. A ﬂow cytometric immunoassay was used to
measure phorbol ester stimulated pERK production in
lymphocytes.

2.8. PK/PD relationship

The relationship between AZD8330 plasma concen-
trations and inhibition eﬀects was investigated using
the maximum inhibition eﬀect (Emax) model.

2.9. Antitumour activity

Tumour response was assessed every 8 weeks using
Solid Tumors

in

Response Evaluation Criteria
(RECIST) version 1.0.

No formal statistical analysis was performed; data
were summarised using descriptive statistics and graph-
ical presentations.

3. Results

3.1. Patients

WHO, World Health Organization.

a n = 83, one patient did not receive treatment.

Eighty-two patients were enrolled in 11 cohorts:
AZD8330 OD 0.5 mg (n = 9), 0.75 mg (n = 6), 1.5 mg
(n = 6), 3 mg (n = 9), 6 mg (n = 7), 12 mg (n = 8),
12 mg (n = 7; repeated cohort), 20 mg (n = 9), 40 mg
(n = 9), 60 mg (n = 3) and AZD8330 BID 20 mg
(n = 9) (Table 1).

3.2. Safety

AEs were reported by 77/82 patients (94%) (Table 2).
The most frequent grade P3 AEs were pneumonia
(n = 3), left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (n = 3), hallu-
cination (n = 3), respiratory failure (n = 3) and hypoten-
sion (n = 3) (Supplementary Table). In total, 47/82
(57%) patients had an AE considered to be AZD8330-

related by the investigator, with the most frequent being
acneiform dermatitis (13/82, 16%), fatigue (11/82, 13%),
diarrhoea (11/82, 13%) and vomiting (9/82, 11%). Only
LV dysfunction was considered related to AZD8330 by
the investigator. Three patients experienced LV ejection
dysfunction, of which one was a serious adverse event
(SAE) deemed AZD8330 treatment related. All cases
resolved. The SRC elected to expand the 12 mg OD
cohort because of the inconsistent reports of reduced
ejection fraction and the multigated acquisition scans
were included as a protocol amendment. No further
results of concern were observed in the expanded cohort,
including electrocardiographic parameters or laboratory
abnormalities of troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP). Thus, 12 mg OD was declared tolerable.

SAEs were reported in all cohorts (32/82 patients;
39%) except the 0.75 mg OD cohort; the majority were
not considered AZD8330 related by the investigator.
Additional safety results are provided in the Supplemen-
tary section. One instance of each of the following
AZD8330-related SAEs was recorded: 12 mg OD, LV
dysfunction; 40 mg OD, unilateral visual hallucination,
hallucination, vomiting, worsening diarrhoea and neu-
tropenic fever; 60 mg OD, mental status change; 20 mg
BID, folliculitis, rhabdomyolysis and hypoxia. In total,
four DLTs were observed during the study. Three
patients,
in the 40 mg (2/9 patients) and the 60 mg
(1/3) OD cohorts, experienced mental status changes
including: confusion, mental status change and halluci-
nations. These DLTs occurred 27, 46 and 48 days after
the ﬁrst dose of AZD8330 and were reversible upon
treatment cessation. The mental status AEs seen in the
40 mg OD cohort occurred outside the 30-day DLT
evaluation period, allowing per protocol dose escalation
to 60 mg OD. Mental status AEs were also seen in the
60 mg OD cohort. No relationship between mental sta-
tus change AEs and exposure was seen, as measured
by the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)
and the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to
inﬁnity (AUC0–1), on days 1 and 15. The AZD8330
40 mg and 60 mg doses were deﬁned as non-tolerated.
A 20 mg BID dose was then assessed as an interim dose
to minimise the mental status change AEs observed in
the 40 and the 60 mg cohorts. One of nine patients in
the 20 mg BID cohort experienced a grade 3 rash
19 days after starting AZD8330, which resolved after a

21-day treatment interruption. Thus, AZD8330 20 mg
BID met the deﬁnition of the MTD.

Ten patients permanently discontinued treatment
because of an AE. The following AEs leading to discon-
tinuation were considered to be related to AZD8330 by
the investigator: hallucination,
intestinal obstruction,
pathological fracture, pneumonia, increased blood bili-
rubin and pancreatitis. Four patients in the 40 mg OD
cohort and one patient in the 20 mg OD cohort had a
dose reduction. Ten patients died between days 13 and
57 of study treatment, all due to disease progression.

3.3. PK analysis

A summary of PK parameters is displayed in Table 3.
Steady-state plasma concentrations are shown in Fig. 1.
Following a single dose (0.5–60 mg OD), AZD8330 was
rapidly absorbed and the median time to maximum
plasma concentration (tmax) ranged from 0.3 to 1 h
(Table 3). The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2;
Table 3), oral clearance and volume of distribution
appeared to be independent of dose. Steady state was
achieved by day 15 (after 8 days of multiple dosing);
AZD8330 exposure (AUC from 0 to 4 h post-dose)
was comparable on days 15, 22 and 29 (data not shown).
AZD8330 accumulation (RAC in Table 3) was minimal
with no time-dependent PK changes observed following
multiple dosing; the temporal change parameter was
approximately 1. Exposure to AZD8330 (Cmax and
AUC0–1) increased approximately proportionally with
dose across the dose range 0.5–60 mg OD.

3.4. PD analysis

Dose- and time-dependent modulation of pERK in
PBMCs was observed at doses P3 mg (Table 4). At
20 mg BID, pERK was reduced to an average of 25%
of pre-dose levels after 1.5 h post-dose and remained
at an average of 66% after 12 h post-second dose.

3.5. PK/PD relationship

The Emax of AZD8330 was 97.6% (% coeﬃcient of
variation [CV] 3.6) (Fig. 2), with the AZD8330 plasma
concentration that gave half the Emax being 10.1 ng/
mL (%CV 11.05) or 2 nM free plasma AZD8330.
AZD8330 in vitro inhibits MEK1/2 with an IC50 of
7 nM,6 comparable to the EC50 (2 nM) observed in this
study. The PK/PD model predicted that
following
AZD8330 20 mg BID administration to steady state,
the population median inhibition of pERK would be
approximately 80% at the time corresponding to Cmax
and at 4 h post-dose the percentage inhibition of pERK
would decline to approximately 40%.

3.6. Antitumour activity

One patient in the 40 mg OD cohort with malignant
melanoma achieved a partial RECIST response.
Thirty-two patients (39%) with a wide range of tumour
types had stable disease, with a duration >3 months in
22 patients. One patient with BRAF-positive papillary
thyroid cancer had stable disease for 1 year, and one
patient with BRAF-positive melanoma had stable dis-
ease for 6 months. Molecular tumour characterisation
was not a formal part of the study protocol.

4. Discussion

This large phase I study presents the ﬁrst clinical
results of the MEK1/2 inihibitor AZD8330, and demon-
strates a manageable toxicity proﬁle for AZD8330 at the
MTD of 20 mg BID. Although AZD8330 was veriﬁed as
a MEK inhibitor through conﬁrmed inhibition of pERK
in this study, its toxicity proﬁle diverged somewhat from
those of other known MEK inhibitors.

The most frequent AZD8330-related toxicities of
acneiform dermatitis, fatigue, diarrhoea and vomiting
in this study are consistent with those seen with other
MEK inhibitors, although they occurred at a lower rate.
Rash-related toxicity is the most common AE reported
with MEK inhibitors (74–92%),1,3,5 but limited rash-
related toxicity was observed with AZD8330 (28%), with
one rash DLT at 20 mg BID. Eye-related toxicity is
often reported with MEK inhibitors (12–23%),1,3,7,8
but did not occur as often in this study (4%) and no
instances of central serous retinopathy or retinal vein
occlusion3 were observed. Cardiac events have been pre-
viously reported with other MEK inhibitors3,5 and thus

were not unexpected. One patient in the 12 mg OD
cohort experienced an SAE of LV dysfunction. How-
ever, no additional cardiac results of concern were
observed in the expanded 12 mg OD cohort, conﬁrming
this dose as tolerable.

The DLTs of mental status changes in the 40 mg OD
cohort were an important and unexpected ﬁnding as
these have been reported infrequently with selumeti-
nib,1,9 trametinib,2,3 RO49876555 and CI-1040.10 Hallu-
cination has been reported occasionally with PD-
0325901.7 It is possible that these observations may
reﬂect blood–brain barrier penetration by AZD8330 or
diﬀerences in PK characteristics between AZD8330
and other MEK inhibitors. However, the ﬁrst suggestion
is unlikely, as preclinical tests in rats show minimal
AZD8330 penetration into the central nervous system
(data on ﬁle, AstraZeneca, 2007). Any potential link
between PK and toxicity was not tested for in this study
and cannot be directly compared with other MEK
inhibitors, so this remains a matter of speculation.

Preclinical studies demonstrated that AZD8330 OD
and BID dosing schedules had similar eﬃcacy in xeno-
graft models.6 A 20 mg BID dose was evaluated in this
study to minimise the mental
status change AEs
observed in 40 and 60 mg cohorts, whilst maintaining
suﬃcient pERK inhibition to optimise clinical eﬃcacy.
However, the results failed to indicate a relationship
between mental status change AEs and exposure, as
measured by Cmax and AUC0–1 on days 1 and 15.

The relatively low toxicity known to be associated
with MEK inhibition suggests that the tissue drug con-
centrations in this study may have been inadequate to
achieve suﬃcient target inhibition, but it is not possible
to conﬁrm this directly. PK/PD data conﬁrmed dose-

dependent modulation of pERK in PBMCs at doses
P3 mg. Twelve hours after the second dose of the
day, pERK was reduced to 66% of baseline at the
MTD. This level of inhibition in a surrogate tissue is
comparable to that seen with selumetinib, which demon-
strated mean pERK inhibition of 51% maintained
through BID dosing.1 However, tumour biopsies, which
might have conﬁrmed parallel target tumour inhibition,
were not performed and so the actual inhibition of tar-
get in the tumour is unknown.

n = 1;

stable disease >3 months,

The clinical activity observed with AZD8330 (partial
response
n = 22;
26.8%), was similar to that reported in a phase I study
of
selumetinib (stable disease at day 56, n = 19;
33.0%).1 Oral AZD8330 was rapidly absorbed and expo-
sure increased approximately proportionally with dose
across the dose range 0.5–60 mg OD. Given the preclin-
ical potency of AZD8330 (7 nM),6 it was expected that
clinical eﬃcacy would be observed at low exposure lev-
els. Consequently, the minimal clinical activity observed
in our patient population is striking, considering the
high proportion of patients with melanoma and there-
fore presumed high frequency of BRAF mutations. This
observation supports the hypothesis that AZD8330
tumour penetration and pathway inhibition may have
been insuﬃcient.

Biopsies were not mandated in this study, nor were
tests for tumour mutational status. Selumetinib and tra-
metinib have shown clinical responses in KRAS-mutant
non-small cell lung cancer4 and BRAF-mutant mela-
noma,11 respectively, and indeed, one patient with
BRAF-positive melanoma and another with BRAF-posi-
tive papillary thyroid cancer had stable disease for 6 and
12 months, respectively in this study.

In conclusion, AZD8330 demonstrated a manageable
toxicity proﬁle with fewer class-eﬀect AEs compared
with other MEK inhibitors. Target inhibition, as mea-
sured by reduction of pERK phosphorylation in
PBMCs, was demonstrated with very modest evidence
of clinical activity. MEK inhibitors are showing genuine
promise in the treatment of advanced malignancies, with
associated AEs that require clinical consideration. Data
from this study will expand our understanding of the full
range of MEK inhibitor toxicities.
