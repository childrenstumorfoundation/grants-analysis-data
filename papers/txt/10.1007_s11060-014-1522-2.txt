Abstract NF1, NF2, and Schwannomatosis are incurable
tumor suppressor syndromes associated with poor quality of
life. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efﬁcacy of an NF adapted,
8-week group mind body skills based intervention, the relax-
ation response resiliency program (3RP) aimed at improving
resiliency and increasing satisfaction with life. Patients seen at
MGH’s Neuroﬁbromatosis Clinic were offered participation if
they described difﬁculties coping to a treating physician. Par-
ticipants completed measures of life satisfaction, resiliency,
stress, mood,
lifestyle, pain, post-traumatic growth and
mindfulness at baseline and after completing the 3RP program.
The intervention had relative feasible enrollment rate (48 %
rate, 32 out of 67 of patients signing the informed consent
form). However, out of the 32 patients who signed the
informed consent, only 20 started the study (62.5 %) and only
16 completed it (50 %), suggesting problems with feasibility.
The main reason cited for non-participation was burden of
travel to the clinic. The intervention was highly acceptable, as

evidenced by an 80 % completion rate (16/20). Paired t tests
showed signiﬁcant improvement in resiliency, satisfaction
with life, depression, stress, anxiety, mindfulness and post
traumatic growth, with effect sizes ranging from 0.73–1.33.
There was a trend for signiﬁcance for improvement in soma-
tization and sleepiness (p = 0.06), with effect sizes of
0.54–0.92 respectively. Statistically nonsigniﬁcant improve-
ment was observed in all other measures, with effect sizes
small to medium. In sum, the 3RP was found to be relatively
feasible, highly acceptable and preliminary efﬁcacious in
decreasing symptom burden in this population, supporting the
need of a randomized controlled trial.

Introduction

The neuroﬁbromatoses,
including neuroﬁbromatosis 1
(NF1), neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis,
comprise a group of genetically distinct disorders of the
nervous system uniﬁed by the predisposition to nerve sheath
tumors. These histologically benign tumors can occur
anywhere in the body and often cause signiﬁcant morbidity
including disﬁguring cutaneous tumors (NF1); complete
hearing loss, facial weakness, and poor gait (NF2); and
chronic disabling pain (schwannomatosis). In addition to
the increased risk of benign tumors, patients with these
genetic syndromes are at higher risk for malignant tumors
and can develop non-tumor manifestations that affect the
nervous system, eyes, and skin. Currently there is no cure
for NF, with symptom management provided by surgery
and palliative measures as the primary means of treatment.
The current health care model for neuroﬁbromatosis
(NF) is almost entirely biomedical. In this model, health

123

care providers have focused on identifying various mani-
festations of NFs (e.g., nerve sheath tumors, learning dis-
ability, pseudoarthrosis) and providing medical treatments.
This model of care is incomplete, as it does not address the
consistent research ﬁndings showing that patients with NFs
have lower quality of life compared to general population
[1]. Patients with NFs also have signiﬁcantly more symp-
toms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of perceived
stress, lower levels of self-esteem and more pain as com-
pared with general population norms [2]. Furthermore,
research has shown that there is no association between
severity of NF and emotional functioning [2], suggesting
that psychosocial factors are more important than, or as
important as, severity of disease.

Within the past decade, the care of patients with medical
illnesses (e.g., diabetes, chronic pain, cancer) has transi-
tioned from biomedical to biopsychosocial, where mind–
body treatments are integrated within medical care [3].
Research on such biopsychosocial models has shown that
they not only improve quality of life and enhance outcomes
of medical treatments including surgeries, but also reduce
medical care utilization and cost [4]. In spite of all the
aforementioned factors, such biopsychosocial models of
care have not yet been studied in patients with NFs. This
represents an unexplored opportunity to improve quality of
life and to decrease cost of care for patients with NFs.

life, emotional

For this reason the main purpose of this study was to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted ver-
sion of the relaxation response resiliency program (3RP)
for patients with NFs. We followed guidelines established
by Rounsaville [5] for psychosocial clinical trials, and
conducted an open pilot study prior to investing in a large
randomized controlled trial. The 3RP [6] is a group-format
mind–body treatment that has been found efﬁcacious in
improving quality of
functioning and
decreasing pain and stress in a group of patients with a
variety of chronic illnesses including chronic pain, diabe-
tes, cardiovascular problems, IBS, headaches [7, 9] and in a
group of patients with chronic temporomandibular joint
disease [8]. Within this treatment, patients learn methods to
elicit the relaxation response to decrease the physiological
effects of stress, stress awareness strategies, and positive
psychology coping skills. The main goals of the program
are improving satisfaction with life and increasing resil-
iency (the ability to cope with stress and disease symp-
toms). Secondarily we wanted to test
the preliminary
efﬁcacy of the adapted 3RP for patients with NF in
improving satisfaction with life and resiliency (primary
study variables) as well as improving depression, anxiety,
somatization, mindfulness, posttraumatic growth, healthy
eating, social support, optimism, and reducing pain catas-
trophizing (negative thoughts about pain), perceived stress
and daytime sleepiness.

Materials and methods

Patients were recruited from a Neuroﬁbromatosis Clinic
from an academic medical center. Recruitment occurred
between November 2012 and October 2013, with breaks
for major holidays and during the summer. Only 1 group
was conducted at the time, and recruitment stopped during
the duration of the group. During this period approximately
330 patients presented to the clinic, but not all were offered
participation. The neurologist routinely asks patients about
their stress level, and those endorsing stress during the
recruitment periods were asked if they were interested in
hearing about the current study. We chose this method of
screening as it can be easily incorporated in clinics, does
not require training, and allows patients to self select for
participation. Sixty-seven patients were then approached
by a study member to discuss details of the study and see if
they meet inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Of these
32 signed the informed consent form and agreed to par-
ticipate. Inclusion criteria for the current study were: (1)
age 18 or older; (2) can read and speak English; and (3)
diagnosis of neuroﬁbromatois type 1, neuroﬁbromatosis
type 2, or schwannomatosis. Exclusion criteria included the
following: (1) severe active or untreated major mental ill-
ness that would interfere with study participation (e.g.
untreated psychosis or active suicidality); (2) recent (within
the past 3 months) change in antidepressant medication;
(3) history or current use of formal relaxation training
(including past participation in a mind–body program); and
(4) inability or unwillingness to s complete psychological
assessments online via the RedCap (Research Electronic
Data Capture) system [10].

The study was approved by our institution’s Review
Board and all study subjects provided written consent. The
3RP mind body program included 8 weekly sessions, each
90 min long, delivered in a face-to-face group setting by a
clinical psychologist. Pre- and post-intervention assess-
ments were completed online from the patients’ home via
the secure, web-based RedCap [10]. Participants completed
a total of 15 instruments that were mapped onto the 3RP
and measure concerns that are typical to patients with
chronic illnesses. Some of these questionnaires assessed
constructs such as sleep, healthy eating and mindfulness
that have not been assessed before in patients with NF, but
have been found to be important markers of quality of life
in patients with chronic illness [11]. Because we grouped
patients across the 3 diagnoses, we chose instruments that
can be applied for all patients, rather than diseases speciﬁc
measures. Further, we chose measures with good psycho-
metric properties. The surveys were tested prior to study
commencement and found to take 10–20 min to complete.
To guard against patient fatigue, patients were told to take
breaks during questionnaire completion, save the data, and

then simply return and ﬁnish the questionnaire at a future
timepoint. Exit interviews conducted by the second author
with a subsample of patients did not show difﬁculties or
patient burden due to completion of questionnaires.

The relaxation response resiliency enhancement
program (3RP)

The 3RP mind–body program is a comprehensive outpa-
tient program based on the principles and practice of mind–
body medicine. It is designed to improve quality of life and
increase resiliency (coping with stress) through the teach-
ing of self-care strategies. The crux of the clinical program
is the elicitation of the relaxation response in each session,
using a variety of methods, including single pointed med-
itation, imagery, mindful awareness, contemplation and
yoga. The program incorporates educational information
about
training to develop
mind–body awareness, cognitive and behavioral skills such
as cognitive restructuring and promotion of healthy life-
style behaviors (e.g., sleep and mindful eating), as well as
skills incorporated from positive psychology (e.g., culti-
vation of positive emotions and thoughts (e.g., apprecia-
tion, optimism), use of humor, empathy, and support).

the mind–body connection,

(2)

The original program manual was modiﬁed in our study
to address speciﬁc needs of patients with NF, which were
identiﬁed previously during 2 focus groups (N = 15 par-
ticipants) and literature search. During this focused groups
patients were asked open ended questions about the need
for a mind body group, interest in potential participation,
difﬁculties managing the NF, and about speciﬁc stressors
associated with NF1, NF2 and Schwannomatosis, Speciﬁc
modiﬁcations included: (1) learning to manage NF speciﬁc
stressors such as burden of medical appointments, dating
and difﬁculties hearing;
restructuring NF speciﬁc
thoughts such as those associated with self image, career,
etc.; (3) learning acceptance techniques to address issues
associated with making sense of having NF and dealing
with the uncertainty of having this condition. The original
3RP manual was modiﬁed to address these changes and
was used uniformly with each group. Each of the 8 sessions
involved a review of previously learned skills, introducing
and practicing a new relaxation response technique, and
learning a speciﬁc cognitive behavioral or positive psy-
chology based skills and applying it to speciﬁc patient
speciﬁc issues. Groups were small (3–6 participants/group)
which allowed the facilitator
to ensure that patients
understood and practiced the skills taught. The 3 diagnostic
categories were grouped together for the purpose of this
study for several reasons. First, there are many similarities
among patients with NF1, NF2 and Schwannomatosis such
as common stressors associated with symptoms (e.g.,
appearance concerns, pain, uncertainty about progression/

growth of tumors, social isolations, concerns about trans-
mission through pregnancy). In fact, it can be argued that
there is more heterogeneity of symptoms within each
diagnoses category than between the 3 diagnoses. Second,
patients within the 3 categories, as a group, share similar
psychosocial difﬁculties and decreased quality of life.
Third, the 3RP is not aimed to target underlying diseases
processes, as would a drug; rather, it is aimed at improving
coping with stress and symptoms (e.g., increase resiliency)
and satisfaction with life. We dealt with the heterogeneity
of NF by asking patients to set general and weekly practice
goals that are speciﬁc to them, and teaching them to apply
them to their individual goals and concerns. For example, a
patient with NF1 who has facial tumors might set a goal of
decreasing self consciousness while a patient with sch-
wannomatosis might set a goal of improving coping with
pain. Both patients can beneﬁt from relaxation response
strategies as well as from cognitive behavioral and positive
psychology skills to help them develop acceptance and an
adaptive response to a chronic incurable situation.

Survey measures

The satisfaction with life scale is a 5-item reliable and valid
self-report measure of global life satisfaction. Responses
are made on a 7-point scale with higher scores reﬂecting
higher life satisfaction [12].

The Resiliency Scale [13] is a 14 item self report
measure assessing resiliency—that is, the ability to suc-
cessfully deal with adversity of life. This is a psychomet-
rically sound measure with high scores showing higher
resiliency.

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen [14]) is a
10-item scale designed to measure the degree to which
situations in one’s life are appraised, or considered as
stressful. Items were designed to detect how unpredictable,
uncontrollable and overloaded respondents ﬁnd their lives.
The measure is reliable and valid with higher scores rep-
resenting higher stress [15].

The Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised
(CAMS-R) is a 12-item scale that measures everyday
mindfulness, and focuses on the degree to which patients
experience their thoughts and feelings. This is a reliable
and valid scale with higher scores representing higher
mindfulness [16].

The Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R) is a 10 item
self-report measure developed to assess individual differ-
ences in generalized optimism versus pessimism. The
measure is reliable and valid with higher scores repre-
senting optimism and lower pessimism [17].

The Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; [18] is a
21 item reliable and valid scale assessing how successful
people are in coping with challenging life events,
in

123

106

J Neurooncol (2014) 120:103–109

reconstructing or strengthening their perceptions of self,
others and meaning of events. Higher scores depict higher
posttraumatic growth.

The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a 13-item scale
that measures negative pain related cognitions and cata-
strophic thinking (thinking of the worst) [19]. The measure
is reliable and valid [20], with higher scores depicting
higher catastrophizing.

The Numerical Rating Scale is an 11-point rating scale
that measures pain intensity. The measure is reliable and
valid [21].

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-item scale
that measures daytime sleepiness [22] with good psycho-
metric properties [23]. The scale measures an individual’s
likelihood of falling asleep in routine situations. Higher
scores depict higher sleepiness.

The CIGNA Healthy Eating Survey–Section H is a 7
item self report instrument that measures behavioral eat-
ing—that is, patterns of eating in response to an emotional
need rather than hunger cues [24].

The Medical Outcomes Study social support, the emo-
tional support subscale is an 8-item subscale that measures
perceptions of emotional support in medical population
[24]. It has good reliability and validity [25].

Patient-Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9) is a 9
item reliable and valid scale that measures presence and
severity of symptoms of depression consistent with the
DSM-V [26]. Higher scores depict more severe depression.
Patient Health Questionnaire Somatic Symptoms
Severity (PHQ-15) is a 15 item reliable and valid scale that
assesses the impact of various bodily symptoms on ones
life [26].

Patient-Health Questionnaire Anxiety is an 11 item
reliable and valid scale that measures severity of anxiety
symptoms [26]. Higher scores depict more severe anxiety.

differences between the 3 diagnostic groups. Results are
thus reported for completers only. The completer cohort
(N = 16) included 9 patients with NF1, 1 with Schwan-
nomatosis and 6 with NF2. Participants had a mean age of
57 and were 9 (56.2 %) women and 7 (43.8 %) men.
Table 1 details all demographics. Out of the entire sample,
3 patients underwent outpatient surgery during the 8 weeks
groups, but surgery did not prevent them from attending the
subsequent group sessions.

Feasibility and acceptability

Feasibility of enrollment was moderate with 32 out of the
67 participants approached signing the informed consent
form (48 % rate). Feasibility of study completion was low;
out of the 32 participants who signed the consent form,
only 20 started the intervention (62.5 %) due to inability to
attend the group at the speciﬁc date/time, and only 16 of
these 32 (50 %) completed the intervention. The burden of

J Neurooncol (2014) 120:103–109

107

traveling to the clinic for face-to-face groups was the rea-
son for declining participation in the majority of patients.
Other reasons included: difﬁculties with the group setting
due to shyness [1], not free at the assigned time [9] and not
feeling the program is a good ﬁt (1 participant).

Acceptability was determined by percent patients who
completed the intervention. Of the 20 participants who
completed pre-program measure 16 (80 %) completed
post-program measures. Two of the patients were wheel-
chair bound and dropped out after the ﬁrst session due to
difﬁculties with transportation. One participant attended 6
out of the 8 sessions but refused to complete the posttest.
One participant completed the pretest questionnaire but
then stated she would like to participate in an NF2 speciﬁc
group. Due to an administrative oversight the question-
naires assessing depression, somatization and anxiety were
completed only by 10 participants.

Preliminary efﬁcacy

There were no signiﬁcant differences in pre- or post-
intervention outcome measures by any of the demographic
variables (p [ 0.1). Paired t
tests showed signiﬁcant
improvement in resiliency, satisfaction with life, stress,
depression, anxiety, somatization, sleepiness, mindfulness
and post traumatic growth, with effect sizes ranging from
0.73–1.33. There was a trend for
signiﬁcance for
improvement in somatization and sleepiness (p = 0.06),
with effect sizes of 0.54–0.92 respectively. Of note, the ES
for somatization is high, yet is not signiﬁcant, likely due to
the fact
that due to an oversight only 10 participants
completed this measure. No signiﬁcance differences were
observed in optimism, social support and eating behaviors.
With regard to pain catastrophizing, scores decreased in 9

patients, stayed the same in 3 and worsened in 4. Of the 4
patients whose coping with pain worsened, 3 had surgeries
during the course of the intervention. Analyses with the 3
participants excluded showed an overall improvement in
the sample of 13 participants, but it remained not signiﬁ-
cant with this small sample (E.S. = 0.399) (Table 2).

Discussion

The aim of the study was to examine the acceptability, fea-
sibility and preliminary efﬁcacy of the comprehensive NF-
adapted mind body intervention, the 3RP. We found the
intervention to have relatively low general feasibility but high
acceptability in this population. We found the intervention to
be efﬁcacious as evidenced by improvement in resiliency,
satisfaction with life, stress, depression, worry, mindfulness
and posttraumatic growth. There were trends for improve-
ments in sleepiness and somatization. Improvement in pain
coping was also signiﬁcant for a subsample of patients who
did not have any medical procedures during the course of the
intervention. Results of this study provide support for a future
randomized controlled trial to test the efﬁcacy of the inter-
vention when compared to a control group.

Results of this study should be viewed in light of several
limitations. First, this is an open pilot with no control
group. Because of the absence of random assignment to a
control group, it does not allow us to draw robust conclu-
sions about the efﬁcacy of the 3RP. Second, we do not
know percent of patients who endorsed stress out of the
entire pool of patients presenting to the clinic, which may
impact feasibility. Third, several participants underwent
medical procedures during the course of the study, which
impacted results, particularly their reports of pain, and may

have underestimated improvement for all patients. Further,
although the participants represented clinic attendees, this
was a fairly homogenous group of participants. Further
studies are needed to examine whether the 3RP is effective
for racial/ethnic minorities as well as for people with lower
education levels who have NF. Although we did not ﬁnd
differences in psychosocial functioning among patients
with NF1, NF2 and Schwannomatosis,
future studies
should assess for these differences in improvement with a
larger sample, and if such are found,
to subsequently
modify the intervention to address these potential differ-
ences. Further, the 3RP may have differential results in
patients with NF who have a cognitive component to their
disease. We have taken this into account by ensuring that
the intervention is appropriate for a 7th grade reading level,
but this issue should further be explored in future studies.
Additionally, the efﬁcacy of the 3RP may be different for
patients who have a biological (e.g., brain) component to
their mood symptoms, as opposed to those whose mood is
negatively impacted purely by coping with symptoms.
Future studies should explore these concerns. Lastly,
because of the small sample size, we did not correct for
multiple comparisons and type 2 error.

Although acceptability was high, general feasibility was
low in this open trial. The majority of the patients who
refused to participate or did not ﬁnish participation did so
due to the burden of traveling to the clinic. NF is a rare
condition and to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst mind body
intervention developed for patients with NF; future studies
should test the efﬁcacy of the 3RP when delivered via
video conferencing with ﬂexibility in the timing of the
groups,
to improve feasibility. Although we allowed
hearing impaired patients in the study, we excluded
patients who were deafened. Future studies should adapt
and test the intervention on a format that would be acces-
sible to deafened participants. Lastly, the lack of long-term
follow-up data does not allow for conclusions about the
maintenance of symptom improvements. Patients who
show improvement immediately post-treatment may not
sustain these gains over time. Thus, further research is
needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the 3RP.
