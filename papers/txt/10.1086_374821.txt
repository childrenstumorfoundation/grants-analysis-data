An NF1 microdeletion is the single most commonly reported mutation in individuals with neuroﬁbromatosis type
1 (NF1). Individuals with an NF1 microdeletion have, as a group, more neuroﬁbromas at a younger age than the
group of all individuals with NF1. We report that NF1 microdeletion individuals additionally have a substantially
higher lifetime risk for the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors than individuals with NF1
who do not have an NF1 microdeletion. This should be taken into account in the medical follow-up of individuals
with an NF1 microdeletion.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1 [MIM 162200]) is an
autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1/
4,000 (Huson et al. 1989). NF1 is a tumor-suppressor
gene located on chromosome band 17q11.2. The main
features of NF1 are benign neuroﬁbromas, cafe´-au-lait
spots, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, and learning dis-
abilities. Most of the patients have a small truncating
mutation in the NF1 gene (point mutation, splice muta-
tion, small deletion, insertion, or duplication). However,
5%–10% of individuals with NF1 have a microdeletion
(Clementi et al. 1996; Cnossen et al. 1997; Rasmussen
et al. 1998). Most of these have a 1.5-Mb deletion in-
corporating the entire NF1 region (Lo´ pez-Correa et al.
2000; Dorschner et al. 2000). In rare cases, both bigger
and smaller microdeletions have been observed (Lo´ pez-
Correa et al. 1999; Dorschner et al. 2000; personal ob-
servation). Genome database analysis indicates that the
common NF1 microdeletion region contains at least 15
genes/transcripts, including NF1 and the three embedded
genes. Most of these genes have unknown functions.

The NF1 microdeletion patients tend to have a different
phenotype as compared with the general NF1 group. NF1
microdeletion patients frequently have more neuroﬁbro-

mas at an earlier age, a lower mean IQ, and nonfamilial
facial features (Kayes et al. 1994; Wu et al. 1995; Leppig
et al. 1997; Tonsgard et al. 1997; Wu et al. 1997). Al-
though, as a group, the NF1 microdeletion patients have
distinct features, it remains difﬁcult at the individual level
to distinguish between deletion and nondeletion patients
solely on the basis of clinical observations, and, at this
time, there is a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation
for individuals with NF1. Because of the enormous clin-
ical variability in phenotypic expression, a medical sur-
veillance program for all individuals with NF1 is nec-
essary to detect a large range of possible complications.
Each complication occurs in only a relatively small per-
centage of individuals with NF1 (Huson and Hughes
1994). The lifetime risk for malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor (MPNST) in individuals with NF1 may be
8%–13%, as reported in a recent study (Evans et al.
2002), and it would be important to identify a subgroup
of individuals with NF1 who have a higher risk of
MPNST.

Elsewhere, we reported germline mutations in seven
patients with NF1 and MPNSTs (Wu et al. 1999). Three
of these had an NF1 microdeletion, suggesting a possibly
increased incidence of MPNSTs in NF1 microdeletion
patients. Dorschner et al. also reported two patients with
MPNSTs in a group of 17 individuals with an NF1 mi-
crodeletion and suggested a predisposition to malignan-
cies in NF1 microdeletion cases (Dorschner et al. 2000).
We wanted to test the hypothesis that individuals with

1288

Reports

an NF1 microdeletion represent a speciﬁc subgroup of
individuals with NF1 and a higher risk of MPNST.

In a multicenter study (Wu et al. 1999; Birindelli et
al. 2001; Leroy et al. 2001; unpublished cases), we tested
the frequency of NF1 microdeletions on a large number
(38) of patients with NF1 and MPNST (all diagnosed
as having NF1 according to the National Institutes of
Health criteria [Stumpf et al. 1987]). This study on ar-
chival material was approved by the institutional review
boards of the different institutes. On histology, all tu-
mors corresponded to sarcomatous cellular prolifera-
tions, consisting of highly cellular, intersecting bundles
of spindle cells, with unequivocal nuclear atypia, promi-
nent typical and/or atypical mitotic ﬁgures, and variable
areas of necrosis. Tumors were graded as low grade (I),
intermediate grade (II), or high grade (III), on the basis
of differentiation, mitotic rate, and amount of tumor
necrosis (table 1). Of the 38 MPNST cases, 24 were high
grade, 2 low grade, 9 intermediate grade, and 2 of un-
known grades. Only two MPNSTs showed features en-
abling classiﬁcation as either triton or epitheloid tumors.
The presence of microdeletions was assessed on non-
tumor tissue by different techniques, depending on the
available material for analysis: a speciﬁc breakpoint PCR
(Lo´ pez-Correa et al. 2001), FISH, semiquantitated PCR,
and/or marker analysis (see table 1). The FISH experi-
ments were performed with PAC clone RPCI5-926B9
located within NF1 (Lo´ pez-Correa et al. 1999). In sev-
eral cases, only DNA was available, and FISH could not
be performed. In these cases, a speciﬁc breakpoint PCR
was performed to detect the common breakpoint junction
fragment. If a speciﬁc deletion junction fragment was not
detected, marker analysis was performed by assessing het-
erozygosity for ﬁve markers located in the NF1 micro-
deletion region (D17S1800: 5(cid:1)NF1-1, 3(cid:1)NF1-1, 3(cid:1)NF1-2,
3(cid:1)NF1-3, and IVS/38-GT; see also Lo´ pez-Correa et al.
[1999]). We excluded an NF1 microdeletion if hetero-
zygosity for markers located in the microdeletion region
was observed in nontumor DNA. We realize that we
might have missed cases with a smaller deletion conﬁned
to the NF1 gene region. Only cases showing no hetero-
zygosity for any of the ﬁve dinucleotide repeats were
further analyzed with semiquantitative PCR for a po-
tential microdeletion.

For the semiquantitated PCR analysis, exon 48 of NF1
was ampliﬁed, together with exon 24 of CFTR as a
control fragment (25 cycles). This semiquantitated PCR
analysis was optimized using known NF1 microdeletion
and nonmicrodeletion individuals. The relative intensity
of the NF1 fragment was scored after electrophoresis on
an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. All primer se-
quences and PCR conditions are available from the au-
thors on request.

Nine of 38 patients with NF1 and MPNSTs (23.7%)
showed an NF1 microdeletion in the nontumor tissue

1289

P ! .005

(table 1). This microdeletion frequency is signiﬁcantly
higher (
; binomial distribution) than expected
in the general NF1 population (5%–10%) (Clementi et
al. 1996; Cnossen et al. 1997; Rasmussen et al. 1998).
To estimate the lifetime risk of MPNST in NF1 micro-
deletion patients (Bayes’s Theorem), we used conser-
vative estimates of the different probabilities. We used
20% (this study 23.7%) for the frequency of an NF1
microdeletion in individuals with NF1 and MPNST
(P[Del/MPNST, NF1]) and 10% (probably an overes-
timation) for the frequency that a patient with NF1 is
a carrier of a microdeletion (P[Del/NF1]). P(MPNST/
NF1) is an estimate of the lifetime risk for the devel-
opment of MPNST in the general NF1 population.

Using these parameters, we estimate that the lifetime
risk for MPNST in NF1 microdeletion patients is twice
as high as in the general NF1 population.

Previous cross-sectional studies showed that only 1%–
2% of individuals with NF1 have MPNST (Huson et al.
1989). Specialist series found higher risks of MPNST in
NF1, owing to a bias toward patients with important
complications that require specialist treatment in a hos-
pital setting (Greager et al. 1992). The lifetime risk of
MPNST in patients with NF1 was recently estimated to
be 8%–13%, in a population-based study with near-total
ascertainment for NF1-related MPNST, using a dual ap-
proach for ascertainment (NF1 register and Cancer reg-
istry) (Evans et al. 2002). Evans et al. (2002) also found
that the majority of patients with NF1 and MPNST clin-
ically present with their malignancy in the 3rd or 4th
decade of life (median 26 years). This is at a much younger
age than individuals who have sporadic MPNST but are
not afﬂicted with NF1 (median 62 years).

In the NF1-microdeletion patient group reported here,
the age at diagnosis does not have a normal distribution
curve because of an outlier (patient C12, 58 years). We
observed a substantial difference in the median age at
diagnosis between deletion and nondeletion cases: 22
years (microdeletion) versus 30 years (nonmicrodeletion).

This difference of 8 years is not signiﬁcant (

onset (21 years vs. 30 years). Therefore, it might be
interesting to assess the signiﬁcance of this difference in
age at diagnosis in a larger study.

It is known that NF1 microdeletion individuals as a
group show a more severe phenotype than the general
NF1 population. One might argue that mildly affected
NF1 individuals with an MPNST have a lower chance
of being diagnosed as NF1 and, thus, a higher chance
of not being included in this study. Therefore, this study

could have a bias toward individuals more severely af-
fected with NF1 with a higher likelihood of harboring
an NF1 microdeletion. We do not think that this bias
plays a role in this study because the NF1 MPNST cases
were diagnosed in centers with multidisciplinary out-
patient clinics for neuroﬁbromatosis. These centers have
a high suspicion for the diagnosis of neuroﬁbromatosis
in cases presenting with MPNST. In addition, we believe
that the potential ascertainment bias for diagnosing an

Reports

individual more severely affected with MPNST as having
NF1 applies also for the referral of an individual with
an NF1-compatible phenotype to a multidisciplinary
clinic. The proportion of NF1 microdeletion individuals
in the total NF1 population is estimated on the basis of
series from multidisciplinary clinics. These series might
also show an ascertainment bias toward more severely
affected cases, resulting in a potential overrepresentation
of NF1 microdeletion individuals. As a result, both as-
certainment biases (NF1 in MPNST population and NF1
deletion in NF1 multidisciplinary clinic population) will
eliminate each other, to a great degree, in the equation.
Our study indicates that NF1 microdeletion patients
have a substantially higher risk for the development of
MPNSTs compared with nonmicrodeletion NF1 indi-
viduals. If we assume that the lifetime risk of MPNST
in NF1 individuals is 8%–13% (Evans et al. 2002), then
NF1 microdeletion patients have a lifetime risk for
MPNST of 16%–26%. We therefore propose routine
testing of individuals with NF1 for the presence of a
microdeletion and follow-up of NF1 microdeletion pa-
tients with a higher level of suspicion for MPNSTs. Com-
plaints of pain and/or rapid growth of tumors should
be actively investigated using a low clinical threshold.
Further molecular investigation of tumoral cells of
neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs from both NF1 micro-
deletion and nonmicrodeletion patients might shed
some light on the molecular pathogenesis of the in-
creased susceptibility for MPNST development in NF1
microdeletion patients.
