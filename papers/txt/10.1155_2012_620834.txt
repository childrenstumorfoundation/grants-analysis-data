The genetic mechanisms involved in the transformation from a benign neuroﬁbroma to a malignant sarcoma in patients with
neuroﬁbromatosis-type-1- (NF1-)associated or sporadic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) remain unclear. It
is hypothesized that many genetic changes are involved in transformation. Recently, it has been shown that both phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play important roles in the initiation of peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs). In human MPNSTs, PTEN expression is often reduced, while EGFR expression is often induced.
We tested if these two genes cooperate in the evolution of PNSTs. Transgenic mice were generated carrying conditional ﬂoxed
phosphodiesterase (Cnp) promoter and a
alleles of Pten, and EGFR was expressed under the control of the 2
desert hedgehog (Dhh) regulatory element driving Cre recombinase transgenic mice (Dhh-Cre). Complete loss of Pten and EGFR
overexpression in Schwann cells led to the development of high-grade PNSTs. In vitro experiments using immortalized human
Schwann cells demonstrated that loss of PTEN and overexpression of EGFR cooperate to increase cellular proliferation and
anchorage-independent colony formation. This mouse model can rapidly recapitulate PNST onset and progression to high-grade
PNSTs, as seen in sporadic MPNST patients.

1. Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are
a rare aggressive form of sarcoma associated with poor
prognosis. MPNSTs can occur sporadically or in the context

of the autosomal dominant neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1)
tumor syndrome [1–3]. Genomic abnormalities, other than
those at the neuroﬁbromin 1 (NF1) locus, have rarely been
detected in benign neuroﬁbromas but are numerous in
MPNSTs suggesting that many secondary genetic changes

2

Sarcoma

are required for the transformation from a benign neuroﬁ-
broma to MPNST. Recurrent homozygous loss of the cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) locus was detected
in majority of atypical neuroﬁbromas [4]. Mutations in
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) or its pathway-
associated genes may also cause tumor initiation in sporadic
MPNSTs that lack NF1 mutations. Activating mutations
in RAS (NRAS or KRAS) or v-raf murine sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations have been reported
in sporadic MPNSTs [5, 6]. As the MPNST genome contain
many abnormalities,
it is likely that many other genes
drive formation of MPNST. Currently, many of the genetic
alterations associated with MPNST initiation/progression
are unknown, and identiﬁcation of these genetic changes
may have profound clinical beneﬁts.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative
regulator of the PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway involved in
regulation of cell growth and survival, is the most frequently
inactivated tumor suppressor gene in sporadic cancer [7].
Pten dosage has been shown to be essential for neuroﬁbroma
development and malignant transformation in the context
of Kras activation [8]. We have previously demonstrated
the synergistic role of Pten inactivation to plexiform neu-
roﬁbroma tumorigenesis and progression to high-grade
PNSTs in the context of neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (Nf1) loss in
Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells [9]. The role of
PTEN in sporadic MPNSTs remains to be elucidated and
importantly, there are no rapid animal models currently
available that can recapitulate sporadic MPNST. Many cases
of NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs have demonstrated
elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression
and gene ampliﬁcation, suggesting that EGFR pathway
activation may be involved in MPNST tumorigenesis [10–
12]. This observation is consistent with the ﬁndings of gain-
and loss-of-function experiments in EGFR transgenic mice
[13]. However, the relationship between PTEN and EGFR in
MPNST initiation/progression remains elusive.

In NF1 patients, Schwann cells are believed to be the
primary pathogenic cell source in neuroﬁbromas because
they show biallelic NF1 gene mutations [14–16]. Pten-
regulated pathways have been shown to be major tumor
suppressive barriers to PNST progression in Schwann cells
in the context of Nf1 loss [9]. Although normal Schwann
cells do not express Egfr, Schwann cell precursors and
subpopulations of mutant Nf1 Schwann cells do express
Egfr [13]. The relationship between Pten and Egfr in
neuroﬁbroma development and progression to aggressive
PNST has not been elucidated or modeled in geneti-
cally engineered mice. We hypothesized that somatic Pten
inactivation and EGFR overexpression in Schwann cells
would promote progressive low-grade to high-grade PNST
formation. To test this hypothesis, Dhh-Cre was used to
elicit recombination of Pten f lox/ f lox [17] alleles, allowing for
inactivation of Pten genes in Schwann cells. EGFR, under
the control of the Cnp promoter (Cnp-EGFR), was used
to allow for its overexpression in Schwann cells [13]. Pten
loss in the context of EGFR overexpression in Schwann cells
resulted in the formation of high-grade PNSTs. Furthermore,

this cooperation was recapitulated in immortalized human
Schwann cells in vitro.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Generation of Transgenic Animals. Generation of trans-
genic mice carrying the Dhh gene regulatory element driving
Cre recombinase (Dhh-Cre) has been previously described
[18] (Figure 1(a)). Transgenic mice carrying the ﬂoxed Pten
allele with the essential exons 4 and 5 of the Pten gene
ﬂoxed with loxP sites have been previously described [17]
(Figure 1(a)). The transgenic mouse carrying the Cnp gene
regulatory element driving EGFR (Cnp-EGFR) has been
previously described [13]. Breeding strategy for generating
various experimental, and control cohorts is shown in
Figure 1(b). Animals were sacriﬁced when moribund due
to paralysis and necropsy performed. All animal work
was conducted according to the University of Minnesota’s
approved animal welfare protocol.

2.2. PCR Genotyping. Identiﬁcation of the various genotypes
from both adult transgenic animal and pups was performed
as follows. Firstly, genomic DNA was isolated from tail
clippings using standard proteinase K treatment, phenol-
chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Genomic
DNA was then dissolved in sterile TE (10 mM tris-HCl
(pH7.5), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8)) and quantiﬁed using a Nan-
odrop spectrophotometer. PCR genotyping was performed
using 50 ng of diluted genomic DNA as template in a
25 μL PCR reaction volume. PCR primers used for Dhh-

2.3. Peripheral Nerve Tumor Analysis. PNSTs were carefully
removed from the sacriﬁced animals under a dissecting
microscope (Leica), washed, and placed in cold phosphate
buﬀered saline (PBS). Any abnormal sciatic nerves, brachial
plexi, and/or sacral plexi were also removed. Trigeminal
nerves attached to the brain were also observed for any
abnormalities and removed. The number of enlarged dorsal
root ganglia was counted for the whole spinal cord. All
reasonably sized tumor nodules (>1 mm in diameter) were
carefully removed using ﬁne forceps and placed in fresh cold
PBS.

Figure 1: Establishing a novel sporadic peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) progression mouse model. (a) Transgenes used to establish
the novel sporadic PNST mouse model. Cnp-EGFR consists of the Cnp regulatory elements driving the EGFR gene expression speciﬁcally
in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells. Floxed Pten allele consists of the essential exons 4 and 5 of the Pten gene ﬂoxed with loxP
sites. Dhh-Cre consists of the Dhh regulatory elements driving Cre recombinase to remove the loxP sites and allow for the inactivation
of the ﬂoxed Pten alleles speciﬁcally in Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells. (b) Breeding strategy for generating experimental and
control animals. Transgenic mice each carrying a single transgene was bred to obtain doubly transgenic mice Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/+ mice
(Pten-het). Doubly transgenic mice were then bred with remaining transgene to obtain triple transgenic Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/+; Cnp-EGFR
mice (Pten-het/C-EGFR). Finally, Pten-het mice were bred with Pten-het/C-EGFR mice to obtain the required experimental and control
cohorts. Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/ f lox; Cnp-EGFR (ΔPten/C-EGFR) and Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/+; Cnp-EGFR (Pten-het/C-EGFR) experimental cohorts.

2.4. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining. Sections for histology
were only taken from larger tumor nodules (>1 mm in
diameter). Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin, routinely
processed, and embedded in paraﬃn. Sections for histology
were cut at 5 microns from the paraﬃn blocks using a
standard microtome (Leica), mounted and heat-ﬁxed onto
glass slides. Slides were either stained with HE using standard
protocols,
immunohistochemistry, and/or toluidine blue
staining as described in the next section.

2.5. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Toluidine Blue (TB)
Staining. Formalin ﬁxed-paraﬃn embedded sections from
various tissues were sectioned at 5 microns, mounted and
heat-ﬁxed onto glass slides to be used for IHC analyses.
Brieﬂy, the glass section slides were dewaxed and rehydrated
through a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration. The
antigen epitopes on the tissue sections were then unmasked
using a commercially available unmasking solution (Vec-
tor Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The tissue section slides were then treated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide to remove any endogenous peroxidases.
◦
C using a M.O.M. mouse
Blocking was performed at 4
immunoglobulin-blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) or
in appropriate normal serum from the host of the secondary
antibody (5% serum in PBS) in a humidiﬁed chamber
for several hours. For IHC, sections were then incubated
◦
C in a humidiﬁed chamber using various
overnight at 4
primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: Ki67 (1 : 200)
(Novocastra), S100ß (1 : 100) (Santa Cruz), Pten (1 : 200)
(Cell Signaling), phospho-Erk1/2 (1 : 400) (Cell Signaling),
phospho-Akt (Ser473) (D9E) (1 : 250) (Cell Signaling), and
phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) (1 : 200) (Cell Signaling). After
primary incubation, sections were washed thoroughly in PBS
before incubating with horseradish peroxidase-secondary
antibody raised against the primary antibody initially used.
After thorough washes with PBS, the sections were treated
with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories)
and allowed for adequate signal to develop before stopping
the reaction in water. Finally, sections were then lightly
counter stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through grad-
ual increase in ethanol concentration, cleared in xylene, and
mounted in Permount (Fisher).

TB staining for mast cells were performed using standard
protocols. Brieﬂy, sections were dewaxed and rehydrated to
water, stained with toluidine blue working solution (0.1%
toluidine blue O in 0.9% sodium chloride pH 2.3) for 2-
3 min, washed 3 times with distilled water before dehydrating
quickly through a series of alcohols, clearing in xylene and
ﬁnally mounted in Permount.

2.6. Histologic Evaluation. Sections stained with HE; anti-
bodies to Ki67 and S100ß antigens; and with toluidine blue
were evaluated for all tumors [19]. Each sample was graded
using established criteria for tumors arising in genetically
engineered mice [20, 21]. Brieﬂy, low-grade PNSTs exhibited
low cellularity with little if any nuclear atypia and mitotic
activity. High-grade PNSTs were increasingly cellular with
increasing nuclear atypia and increasing mitotic activity.

2.7. Microarray Gene Expression Analysis. Diﬀerentially
expressed genes were deﬁned as genes with expression levels
at least 3-fold higher or lower in target groups compared to
normal Schwann cells (N-SC) after applying Benjamini and
Hochberg false discovery rate correction [22] (P ≤ 0.05) in
GeneSpring GX v7.3.1. Custom Aﬀymetrix chip deﬁnition
ﬁle [23] based on RefSeq target deﬁnitions (Hs133P REFSEQ
Version 8) was downloaded and used to provide accurate
interpretation of GeneChip data. Heatmaps were generated
using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1.

2.8. Gene Knockdown and Overexpression. Cultured normal
Schwann cells were derived from a healthy individual’s sciatic
nerve [24] and immortalized by overexpressing both human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and mouse cyclin-
dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) to allow for in vitro studies-
immortalized human Schwann cells referred to as HSC2λ
hereafter (H. Li & M. R. Wallace, manuscript in preparation).
The plasmid vectors shown in Figure 5(a) along with a
plasmid containing piggyBac 7 (PB7) transposase [25] under
the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (construct not
shown) were transfected into HSC2λ cells using the Neon
transfection system, according to manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). PiggyBac (PB) transposon expression con-
structs contain the eukaryotic translation elongation factor
1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) promoter to drive expression of a
PTEN shRNA and/or EGFR cDNA and include a puromycin
resistance gene and green ﬂuorescent protein (Gfp) cDNA
for selection purposes. The PB-control vector contains the
Luciferase and Gfp reporter genes under the control of the
cytomegalovirus early enhancer element and chicken beta-actin
(CAG) promoter. Following transfection, cells underwent
selection in standard DMEM full media containing 4 μg/mL
puromycin (Invitrogen). Transposon-mediated gene transfer
was validated by Gfp expression and quantitative PCR.

2.9. Quantitative PCR in Human Culture Cells. Total RNA
was extracted from 1 million cells using the High Pure RNA
Isolation Kit (Roche). RNA was quantiﬁed by Nanodrop
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) and its purity conﬁrmed by agarose
gel electrophoresis. One microgram of RNA was used
to synthesize cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand
Synthesis (Roche) using both random hexamer and oligo
dT primers. Quantitative PCR reactions were conducted
using LightCycler 480 SYBR I Green (Roche) and run on
an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep gradient S. Primers for PTEN

media containing 4 μg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen). Prolifer-
ation was assessed every 24 hours over 6 days by the MTS
assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Absorbance was read at 490 nm to determine proliferation
and 650 nm to account for cellular debris on a BioTek
Synergy Mx automated plate reader. Experiments were con-
ducted with 4 technical replicates and 3 experimental repli-
cates. Data shown is a representative experimental replicate.

2.11. Colony Forming Assay. Six-well plates were prepared
with bottom agar (3.2% SeaPlaque Agar in DMEM full
media) and allowed to solidify before 10,000 cells in top agar
(0.8% SeaPlaque Agar in DMEM full media) were plated
and allowed to solidify. DMEM full media with 4 μg/mL
puromycin (Invitrogen) was plated over the cells and cells
were incubated under standard conditions (5% CO2 and
◦
C) for 2 weeks. Top media was removed and cells were
37
ﬁxed in 10% formalin containing 0.005% Crystal Violet for
1 hour at room temperature. Formalin was removed and
colonies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope. Twelve
images per cell line were taken and automated colony counts
were done using ImageJ software (NIH). Results shown are a
representative example of 3 independent experiments.

3. Results

3.1. Early Postnatal Lethality Results from Pten Inactivation
and EGFR Overexpression in Schwann Cells. Transgenes used
to generate the sporadic peripheral nerve sheath tumor
progression mouse model are shown in Figure 1(a). Singly
transgenic mice each carrying the three individual transgenes
(Dhh-Cre, Pten f lox/+, and Cnp-EGFR) were interbred to gen-
erate both experimental and control cohorts (Figure 1(b)).
A signiﬁcant diﬀerence in survival was observed between
experimental cohort Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/ f lox; Cnp-EGFR
(abbreviated as ΔPten/C-EGFR hereafter) and control cohort
Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/+; Cnp-EGFR (abbreviated as Pten-het/C-
EGFR hereafter) (P < 0.0001, log-rank test) (Figure 1(c)).
Biallelic inactivation of Pten and EGFR overexpression
(ΔPten/C-EGFR) in Schwann cells led to rapid postnatal
death, resulting in a median survival age of 26 days
(Figure 1(c)). A lesser diﬀerence in survival was observed
between ΔPten/C-EGFR and a control cohort Dhh-Cre;
Pten f lox/ f lox (abbreviated as ΔPten hereafter) (P < 0.0001)
(Figure 1(c)). There was also a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in sur-
vival rate observed between control cohorts ΔPten and Pten-
het/C-EGFR (P = 0.0028) (Figure 1(c)). The occurrence of
peripheral nervous system phenotypes and median survival
age for various cohorts are shown in Table 1. Increasing levels
of Pten with EGFR (Pten-het/C-EGFR) partially alleviated
the severe phenotype, leading to an increase in survival and
median survival age of 415 days (Figure 1(c)). Biallelic inacti-
vation of Pten (ΔPten) alone resulted in a median survival age
of 247-days (Figure 1(c)). In contrast, Dhh-Cre; Pten f lox/+
(abbreviated as Pten-het hereafter) control mice displayed no
obvious phenotype as previously observed [9], while a simi-
lar phenotype was observed in Cnp-EGFR (abbreviated as C-
EGFR hereafter) control mice as previously described [13].

3.2. Severe Peripheral Nervous System Phenotype Observed in
ΔPten/EGFR Animals. ΔPten/C-EGFR experimental animals
displayed multiple enlarged dorsal root ganglia and enlarged
peripheral nerves: brachial plexi, sacral plexi, trigeminal and
sciatic nerves (Figure 2(a), left and Table 1). ΔPten control
animals displayed a similar peripheral nervous system phe-
notype but with delayed latency and at a signiﬁcantly reduced
tumor multiplicity (Figure 2(a), middle and Table 1). Pten-
het/C-EGFR animals displayed a similar peripheral nervous
system phenotype with ΔPten control animals but with a
latency of 415 days (Figure 2(a), right). The enlargement of
peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia has been described
for C-EGFR [13].

Importantly, Pten loss contributed to enlarged dorsal
root ganglion formation. ΔPten/C-EGFR animals had signif-
icantly more enlarged dorsal root ganglia (13.7 ± 7.8, mean
± standard deviation), compared with (i) ΔPten animals
(P = 0.0185, unpaired t-test) and (ii) Pten-het/C-EGFR
animals (P = 0.0473, unpaired t-test) (Figure 2(b) and
Table 1). There was no statistical signiﬁcance in the number
of enlarged dorsal root ganglia between ΔPten (6.7 ± 3.8)
and Pten-het/C-EGFR (5.8 ± 2.6) animals (Figure 2(b) and
Table 1). ΔPten/C-EGFR experimental animals displayed the
following peripheral nerve phenotype: enlarged brachial
plexi (100%), enlarged trigeminal nerves (92%), enlarged
lumbar sacral plexi (50%), and enlarged sciatic nerves
(50%) (Table 1). ΔPten and Pten-het/C-EGFR animals had
a similar incidence of enlarged peripheral nerves: enlarged
brachial plexi (100%), enlarged trigeminal nerves (90∼
100%), enlarged lumbar plexi (10∼20%), and enlarged
sciatic nerves (80%) (Table 1). Histological analysis showed
that enlarged peripheral nerves from ΔPten animals were
low-grade PNSTs, while enlarged peripheral nerves from
Pten-het/C-EGFR control animals were graded as hyperplasia
to low-grade PNSTs based on the same grading criteria
(Table 1). C-EGFR control animals display only peripheral
nerve hyperplasia, with rare incidence of neuroﬁbroma.

3.3. Histopathological and Immunohistochemical (IHC) Anal-
yses. Histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC)
analyses of peripheral nervous system tissues taken from
ΔPten/C-EGFR experimental animals demonstrated high-
grade PNSTs compared with hyperplasia to low-grade PNSTs
seen in Pten-het/C-EGFR animals by histology and Ki67
staining criteria as deﬁned [20, 21] (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).
Mast cells were detected in these enlarged peripheral nerves
by toluidine blue staining (data not shown). Enlarged periph-
eral nerves taken from ΔPten control animals were low-
grade PNSTs as previously observed [9]. Enlarged peripheral
nerves taken from representative experimental and control
animals were positive for S100ß staining, consistent with
nerve association (Figure 3(a)). Enlarged peripheral nerves
taken from ΔPten/C-EGFR and Pten-het/C-EGFR were Ki67-
positive at varying intensities, indicative of cell proliferation
(Figure 3(a)). Analyses for proliferation demonstrated signif-
icant diﬀerences (P < 0.01) in the number of Ki67-positive
cells in ΔPten/C-EGFR animals with high-grade PNSTs when
compared with other cohorts with hyperplasia/low-grade

3.4. Microarray Gene Expression Analysis of Human Peripheral
Nerve Tumor Samples. Both PTEN and EGFR levels in puri-
ﬁed Schwann cells taken from human peripheral nerve and
neuroﬁbroma cells; transformed cells taken from MPNST
cell lines (Figure 4(a)) and solid tumors (Figure 4(b)) at
various stages of disease were analyzed by microarray gene
expression analysis.

Although there may be a trend towards reduced PTEN
expression levels at early stages of the disease, there was a
dramatic decrease in its expression level in the malignant
stage of the disease (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). EGFR mRNA
expression increases as disease progresses from a benign to
a malignant tumor (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)), likely due to the
homogeneity of the cell population. There appears to be a
selective pressure to lose PTEN and gain EGFR expression
levels during tumor evolution.

3.5. Knockdown of PTEN and Overexpression of EGFR Cooper-
ate In Vitro to Oncogenically Transform Immortalized Human
Schwann Cells. Knockdown of PTEN and overexpression
of EGFR were performed in immortalized human Schwann
cells to conﬁrm the phenotype observed in our novel spo-
radic mouse model. The constructs used to express a PTEN
shRNA or EGFR cDNA alone or in combination are shown
in Figure 5(a). HSC2λ cells were transfected with various
constructs and piggyBac transposase to induce transposon-
mediated gene transfer of these constructs (Figure 5(a)).
Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated expression of these
constructs resulted in the expected expression changes at
the mRNA level. PTEN mRNA level was reduced by greater
than 7-fold when PTEN was knocked down alone, and
greater than 11-fold when PTEN was knocked down in the
context of EGFR overexpression. EGFR was overexpressed
by approximately 28-fold either alone or in the context of
PTEN knockdown (Figures 5(b) and 5(c)). While there was
no signiﬁcant change in the rate of cellular proliferation
between cells that expressed the PTEN shRNA or EGFR
alone,
increase in proliferation
when PTEN was knocked down in the context of EGFR
overexpression (P < 0.05, unpaired t-test) (Figure 5(d)).
Similarly, anchorage-independent growth as measured by
soft agar colony formation was enhanced by greater than
3.5-fold when PTEN shRNA and EGFR were expressed in
combination (P < 0.0001) (Figure 5(e)).

there was a signiﬁcant

4. Discussion

It is becoming increasingly clear that PTEN-regulated path-
ways represent important major tumor suppressive barriers
to peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. In the current
study, we addressed the hypothesis that PTEN cooperates
with EGFR in the genetic evolution from a benign to

malignant PNST. This hypothesis was established in a recent
Sleeping Beauty transposon insertional mutagenesis forward
genetic screen for genes responsible for MPNST, which
was performed in the genetic background of EGFR over-
expressing Schwann cells (manuscript in preparation). There
is a fundamental genetic diﬀerence in the evolution of
sporadic MPNST between human and our mouse model:
human sporadic MPNSTs have a prolonged latency due
to the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations within
one clone, while our transgenic mouse model develops
oligoclonal high grade PNSTs rapidly. Thus, our mouse
model may not mimic the genetic diversity of the human
disease and may reﬂect only one genetic subtype of MPNST.
Nevertheless, our current study provides a rapid animal
model for the elucidation of genetic mechanisms that occur
in the context of sporadic or de novo MPNST progression.

EGFR overexpression has been detected in several human
cancers such as breast, gut, and hepatocellular carcinoma
[26–29]. NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs have EGFR
gene ampliﬁcations and overexpression at both the mRNA
and protein level, supporting its role in MPNST tumori-
genesis [10, 11]. In addition to its possible role in tumor
progression, higher tumor EGFR expression has been cor-
related with worse prognosis in patients with MPNST [30].
Activation of EGFR triggers signaling processes that promote
cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, angiogenesis, and
inhibition of apoptosis [31]. A transgenic mouse model with
EGFR overexpression in Schwann cells elicited features of
neuroﬁbromas such as hyperplasia, excess collagen, mast
cell accumulation, and progressive dissociation of non-
myelin-forming Schwann cells from axons [13]. In these
transgenic mice, there was no evidence of high-grade PNSTs
suggesting that additional genetic events are required for
the evolution from a benign neuroﬁbroma to a MPNST.
Analysis of microarray data from cell lines and bulk tumors
isolated from human neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs indicate
that there is a selective pressure to lose PTEN expression,
while EGFR expression is induced during disease progression
(Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). It has recently been shown that loss
of PTEN is associated with elevated EGFR and HER2 expres-
sion and worse prognosis in salivary gland cancer, further
demonstrating the importance of these two genes in other
cancer types [32]. In the current study, we have provided
genetic evidence that loss of Pten cooperates with EGFR
overexpression in Schwann cells, in the evolution from a low-
grade to high-grade PNST using our GEMM. The genetic
mechanism for the transformation involves the upregulation
of both Ras/Mapk/Erk and Pi3k/Akt/mTor signaling pathways
(Figures 3(a) and 4(c)). It is not surprising that a similar
mechanism(s) was also observed in a GEMM with condi-
tional inactivation of Nf1 and Pten in Schwann cells [9].
Further, we show that this mechanism is likely occurring in
human patients, as reduction of PTEN and overexpression
of EGFR cooperate in immortalized human Schwann cells
in culture, endowing these cells with oncogenic properties
such as increased proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth (Figure 5). This further emphasizes the importance
of these two distinct signaling pathways in the tumorigenesis
of both NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs. More intense

inactivation of Pten and EGFR overexpression in Schwann cells resulted in high-grade PNST initiation and/or progression due to the

with low-grade PNST tumorigenesis at low penetrance (middle). Conditional inactivation of Pten alone can result in low-grade PNST
tumorigenesis via the upregulation of the Pi3k/Akt/mTor signaling pathway. Partial conditional inactivation of Pten in the context of EGFR
overexpression in Schwann cells resulted in prolonged latency with hyperplasia to low-grade PNST tumorigenesis at low penetrance (left),
resulting in upregulation of Ras/Mapk/Erk and slight upregulation of the Pi3k/Akt/mTor signaling pathways. SOS1: son of sevenless homolog
