Abstract

Four distinct MAP kinase signaling pathways involving 7 MEK enzymes have been identified. MEK1 and MEK2 are
the prototype members of MEK family proteins. Several MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials. Trametinib is being
evaluated by FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. Selumetinib has been
studied in combination with docetaxel in phase II randomized trial in previously treated patients with advanced
lung cancer. Selumetinib group had better response rate and progression-free survival. This review also summarized
new MEK inhibitors in clinical development, including pimasertib, refametinib, PD-0325901, TAK733, MEK162
(ARRY 438162), RO5126766, WX-554, RO4987655 (CH4987655), GDC-0973 (XL518), and AZD8330.

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways involve a family of protein kinases that play
critical roles in regulation of diverse cellular activities,
including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, mo-
tility, and angiogenesis. The MAPK pathways transduce
signals from various extracellular stimuli (growth factors,
hormones, cytokines and environmental stresses), leading
to distinct intracellular responses via a series of phospho-
rylation events and protein-protein interactions [1].

Four distinct MAPK cascades have been identified and
named according to their MAPK module. These are extra-
cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK), p38 and ERK5. Each of these cascades
comprised of three sequentially acting kinases, activating
one after the other (MAPKKK/MAP3K, MAPKK/MAP2K,
and MAPK). These signaling cascades are often dysregu-
lated in human cancer cells. Many small molecule inhibi-
tors targeting various component of these cascades are
moving quickly from bench to bedside [2-4]. For instance,
vemurafenib is the first B-RAF inhibitor that received FDA
approval in 2011 for the treatment of BRAF V600E/K
mutation positive metastatic melanoma [5,6].

This review focuses on MAP2K or MAPKK component
of each of the four MAPK cascades with their charac-
teristics and the small molecule inhibitors targeting these
proteins/enzymes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase or

MAP2K or MAPKK are commonly known as MEK
proteins.

MEK proteins
MEK proteins belong to a family of enzymes that lie
upstream to their specific MAPK targets in each of the
four MAP kinase signaling pathways and so far 7 MEK
enzymes have been identified (Figure 1). These MEK
enzymes selectively phosphorylate serine/threonine and
tyrosine residues within the activation loop of
their
specific MAP kinase substrates [1].

The molecular weight of MEK proteins ranges between
43 and 50 kDa. Like all protein kinases, they display a
similar structural organization consisting of an amino-
terminal domain, a catalytic domain which is also called
the kinase domain, and the carboxyl-terminal domain
(Figure 2). MEKs share extensive homology in their kinase
domain while the amino- and carboxy-termini are more
diverse.

MEK1 and MEK2 are closely related (Figure 2). They
participate in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction
cascade. MEK 1, also designated as MAPKK-1,
is the
prototype member of MEK family proteins. It is encoded
by the gene MAP2K1 located on chromosome 15q22.31.
The gene, MAP2K2, encoding MEK 2 protein, resides
on chromosome 19p13.3. MEK 1/2 proteins consist of a
N-terminal sequence, a protein kinase domain, and a
C-terminal sequence [7]. The N-terminal sequence con-
tains an inhibitory/allosteric segment, a nuclear export
sequence (a unique feature not shared with other MAPKK
family members), and a docking site (D-domain) that aids
in binding ERK substrates. The kinase domain contains

the ATP binding site and catalytic apparatus. The C-
terminus houses the domain for versatile docking (DVD)
which serves as a major determinant binding site for
upstream components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade
[8]. MEK 1/2 signaling cascade is activated by ligand
binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
leading to
dimerization of the receptors and autophosphorylation of
specific tyrosine residues in its C-terminal region. These
activated receptors recruit and phosphorylate adaptor
proteins Grb2 and SOS, which then interact with
membrane-bound GTPase Ras and cause its activation
[9,10]. H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras function as molecular
switches when an inactive Ras-GDP is converted into an
active Ras-GTP [11]. In its GTP-bound form, Ras recruits
and activates Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf/RaF-1)
[12]. The activated Raf kinases interact and activate MEK
1/2, which in turn catalyze the phosphorylation of threo-
nine and tyrosine residues in the activation sequence
Thr-Glu-Tyr of ERK1/2 [10]. Unlike Raf and MEK 1/2
kinases which have narrow substrate specificity, ERK1 and
ERK2 have a wide variety of cytosolic and nuclear sub-
strates. Activated ERKs can translocate into the nucleus to
initiate diverse cellular responses, such as cell prolifera-
tion, survival, differentiation, motility, and angiogenesis.
For instance, ERK1/2 signaling promotes the progression
of cells from the G0/G1 to S phase by activation of
positive cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and c-Myc [13,14],
and down-regulation of anti-proliferative proteins such as

Tob1, FOXO3a and p21 [15,16]. Similarly the Raf/MEK/
ERK MAP kinase pathway promotes cell survival by
blocking NF-kB, leading to increased transcription of anti-
apoptotic and pro-survival genes like Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
[17]. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is activated in hu-
man cancers via several different mechanisms. Increased
ERK 1/2 signaling is often due to direct mutational activa-
tion or amplification of genes encoding key components
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway such as Ras and B-Raf.
A large-scale cancer genome sequencing study revealed
that B-Raf is mutated in about 20% of all cancers and in
more than 60% of melanomas [18]. Less commonly ERK
1/2 cascade can also be activated by MEKs in solid tumors
including melanoma, colon, and lung carcinomas [19,20].
MEK3 and MEK6 are functionally similar and encoded
by MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 genes, respectively. The
genes are both located on chromosome 17q. MEK3 and
MEK6 consist of 347 and 334 amino acids residues re-
spectively [21]. Structurally MEK6 differs from MEK3 in
terms of C- and N- terminal regions. However, the ATP
binding sites, and serine/threonine and tyrosine catalytic
sites are conserved [22,23]. MEK3/6 signaling pathway is
activated by growth factor stimulation through RTKs.
Additionally, the cascade can also be activated by G-
protein coupled receptors,
intracellular receptors, and
toll-like receptors [24], in response to numerous stimuli
including physical and chemical stresses, hormones, UV
irradiation, and cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and

tumor necrosis factor. These stimuli activate different
MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), which include TAK1,
ASK1/2, DLK, MEKK4, TAO1/2/3 and MLK2/3 [25].
Active MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate MEK3/6,
which in turn catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation
of a threonine/serine and a tyrosine residue in the p38
MAPK. MEK6 activates all the four isoforms of p38 MAP
kinase (α, β, γ and δ) whereas MEK3 can only activate
p38α and p38β isoforms [25]. p38 MAP kinase inhibits
G1/S and G2/M cell cycle progression through down-
regulation of cyclin D1 and Cdc25 expression respectively,
both at the level of gene transcription and post-translation
[26-28]. In addition, MEK3/6-p38 MAPK cascade pro-
motes p53-dependent growth arrest by phosphorylating
p53 at serine 33 and 46 [25]. Together, these targets of

MEK3/6-p38 MAPK pathway (cyclin D1, Cdc25, and p53)
cooperate to arrest the cell cycle. Thus decreased p38 acti-
vity may play an important role in carcinogenesis. For ex-
ample, p38 activity has been shown to be reduced in
hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison to adjacent normal
tissue, with tumor size inversely related to p38 activity [29].
MEK4 and MEK7 are members of the stress-activated
protein kinase (SAPK) signaling cascade. MEK4, a product
of MAP2K4 gene (chromosome 17p11.2) is composed of
399 amino acids residues, whereas MEK7 is encoded by
MAP2K7 gene that maps to chromosome 19p13.3 [21].
MEK4 and MEK7 are homologous in their kinase domains
which contain 11 subdomains, but their N- and C- ter-
minal subunits are different [30]. Upon activation by up-
stream kinases, MAP3Ks including MEKKs (MEKK1–4),

MLK2/3, Tpl-2, DLK, TAO1/2, TAK1 and ASK1/2 catalyze
the phosphorylation of threonine residues in the activation
segment of either MEK4 and MEK7 or MEK4 only [8,31].
Activated MEK4/7 work synergistically and activate JNK
protein kinases, including JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. To exe-
cute their functions, JNKs activate several transcription
factors,
including c-Jun, ATF-2, NF-ATc1, HSF-1 and
STAT3 [32,33]. MEK4/7-JNK signaling pathway acts as a
key tumor suppressive pathway [34,35]. It has also been
reported that MEK4/7 along with its substrate JNK may
promote apoptosis by phosphorylating and inactivating
anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 [36]. The
MEK-JNK signaling also play an important role during
embryogenesis [37]. Transgenic mice studies have shown
that MEK4 activity is required for normal hepatogenesis,
B and T-cell lymphopoiesis, and erythropoiesis [38,39].
There is considerable evidence that MEK4-JNK signaling
cascade is also a critical mediator of cardiac hypertrophy
in response to preload and afterload changes [40]. MEK4,
in addition to its principal target, JNK, also crosstalks with
MEK3/6-p38MAPK pathway by activating p38α and p38β
[41-43]. MEK4 has been consistently observed to be
inactivated by non-sense, missense or deletion mutations
in many solid tumors [44]. The expression of MEK4 was
shown to be down-regulated in 75% of cases of serous
ovarian cancer [45]. It has been hypothesized that loss of
MEK4-p38MAPK signaling cascade may be a relevant
pathway associated with tumorigenesis [46].

MEK5 has 448 amino acid residues, and shares 40%
identity with other protein kinases [47,48]. The upstream
kinases are MEKK2 and MEKK3. Growth factors, oxida-
tive stress and hyperosmotic conditions lead to activa-
tion of MEK5 via dual phosphorylation of its serine 311
and threonine 315 residues [49-52]. The best characte-
rized downstream target of MEK5 is ERK5, also known
as big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1) because it is twice the size
of other MAPKs. The interaction of MEK5 with MEKK2,
MEKK3 or ERK5 is mediated by the PB1 domain of
MEK5 [53]. Upon activation, ERK5 translocates to the
nucleus to stimulate the activity of a number of trans-
cription factors [54-57]. MEK5-ERK5 signaling enhances
progression through the cell cycle [58,59]. ERK5 also plays
a role in cardiovascular development and neural differen-
tiation [60,61]. Overexpression of MEK5 has been repor-
ted in cancers of the colon [62], prostate [63], breast [64],
lymphoma [65], and in malignant mesothelioma [66].

MEK inhibitors in clinical trials
A number of MEK inhibitors have progressed into clinical
trials since the first MEK inhibitor (PD098059) was des-
cribed in the literature in 1995 (Table 1). Currently
thirteen MEK inhibitors have been tested clinically but
only trametinib (GSK1120212), a selective inhibitor of

MEK 1 and 2, has emerged as the first MEK inhibitor to
show favorable clinical efficacy in a phase III trial [67].

MEK inhibitors are sub-divided into two major classes,
ATP non-competitive and ATP competitive inhibitors
(Figure 3). Most of the known MEK inhibitors are non-
competitive i.e. they do not directly compete for the
ATP–binding site. Rather they bind to a unique allosteric
site adjacent to the ATP site. This explains the high speci-
ficity of the non-competitive MEK inhibitors [68].

Trametinib (GSK1120212, JTP 74057)
Trametinib (GSK1120212, JTP-74057) is a potent small
molecule inhibitor of MEK kinase. It is an allosteric,
second generation, ATP non-competitive inhibitor with
nanomolar activity against purified MEK 1 and MEK 2
kinases [69]. Preclinical studies showed efficient inhi-
bition of p-ERK 1/2 which correlates with potent cell
growth inhibition in tumor lines with mutant B-RAF or
Ras. By this mechanism, trametinib induces cell-cycle
arrest. In xenograft models of HT-29 and COLO205
colorectal
trametinib demonstrated
robust anticancer activity when administered daily for
14 days [69,70].

lines,

An early phase I dose-escalation trial of trametinib
(≤3 mg/day continuous or intermittent dosing schedule)
enrolled 206 patients with advanced solid tumors. Dose
limiting toxicities included rash, serous central retino-
pathy and diarrhea. Dose of 2 mg/day was chosen for
further studies. Overall objective response rate was 10%.
However, B-Raf mutant melanoma had a response rate of
33% [71]. These encouraging results led to several phase
II/III clinical trials of trametinib alone or in combina-
tion with other agents [NCT01553851, NCT01682083,
NCT01362296, NCT01619774, NCT01245062, details are
available on clinicaltrials.gov].

In the first published phase III trial of trametinib, 322
previously treated (interferon or chemotherapy) patients
with advanced melanoma with V600E or V600K B-Raf
mutations were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to re-
ceive oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or intravenous che-
motherapy consisting of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2)
or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), every 3 weeks [67]. The median
progression-free survival (PFS) of patients who received
trametinib (4.8 months) was significantly longer than
that of patients who received chemotherapy (1.5 months)
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.45; P < 0.001). At 6 months, the rate
of overall survival was 81% in the trametinib group versus
67% in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.54; P = 0.01).

Pimasertib (AS703026, MSC1936369B)
Pimasertib, also known as AS703026, MSC1936369B, is
a highly potent ATP noncompetitive second generation
inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 [72,73]. Pimasertib selec-
tively binds to the distinctive allosteric site on MEK1/2

[73]. In xenograft models, pimasertib demonstrated sig-
nificant tumor growth inhibition in a human plasma-
cytoma H929 MM cell line at 15 and 30 mg/kg for 21 days
[72]. Tumor regression was also observed at 10 mg/kg in a
mouse model of D-MUT colorectal tumor [73].

A multicenter phase I/II clinical trial of pimasertib
plus FOLFIRI as a second line treatment
in K-Ras
mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) enrolled
16 patients [74].
Initially no DLT was observed at
45 mg/day which allowed dose escalation to 60 mg/day.
At
this dose, 2 of 5 patients experienced grade 3
mucositis/stomatitis leading the expansion of 45 mg/day
cohort. Most
adverse
events (TEAEs) after 3 cycles of treatment were asthe-
nia, diarrhea, mucositis, ocular events, nausea, rash and
vomiting. These TEAEs were observed in more than one
third of the treated subjects. Currently, a few phase I/II
studies are underway to test pimasertib (MSC1936369B)
in the setting of advanced or metastatic solid tumors
including melanoma [NCT01016483, NCT01016483,
NCT016968017, NCT01453387].

common treatment-emergent

Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886)
Selumetinib is a non-ATP competitive highly selective
MEK 1/2 inhibitor with IC50 of 14 nm [75]. In xenograft
models, its antitumor activity correlates with decrease in
phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels.

In a phase I dose escalation study of 57 patients with
advanced cancers, a total daily dose of 200 mg was
suggested for subsequent trials [76]. Rash, diarrhea and
hypoxia were reported as major DLTs. At the recom-
mended dose of 100 mg bid most of these TEAEs were
grade 1 or 2. Other common TEAEs were nausea, fa-
tigue, peripheral edema, transaminitis and blurry vision.
Best response was stable disease and achieved in 33% of
patient at the end of 2nd cycle. Patients with mutated
Ras or Raf remained longer in the study with higher
response rate but analysis of statistical significance could
not be performed due to small number of patients.

Multiple phase II studies were conducted in patients
with papillary thyroid, lung, liver, pancreatic, colorectal
cancers and melanoma [77-82]. Patients in these trials
received selumetinib irrespective of Ras/Raf mutation
status and none of these trials met their primary end
points. However, patients harboring Ras/Raf mutations
had higher objective response rate, indicating the need
of proper patient selection in subsequent studies evalua-
ting selumetinib.

A randomized placebo controlled phase II trial was
done in previously treated patients with K-Ras mutant
stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [83].
Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel plus
either placebo or selumetinib (75 mg twice daily q21 days),
with overall survival (OS) being the primary end point.

Median OS was 9.4 months (m) in selumetinib arm vs
5.2 m in control arm, yet the difference was statistically
non-significant
(HR 0.8, 80% CI 0.56-1.14, p = 0.21).
However, median progression free survival was signifi-
cantly prolonged in selumetinib arm (5.3 m) compared to
control arm (2.1 m). Overall response rate was also better
in selumetinib group. The combination of docetaxel and
selumetinib had higher toxicity than docetaxel alone.
Selumitinib was also studied in recurrent low grade serous
carcinoma of the ovary/peritoneum in a single arm phase
II study and in mitigating radioactive iodine refractoriness
in metastatic thyroid cancer [84,85].

PD-0325901
PD-0325901 is a highly specific and potent synthetic
analog of MEK inhibitor CI-1040. It has subnanomolar
and non-competitive inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.33 nM)
against purified MEK 1 and MEK 2 [86]. PD-0325901
inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in melanoma and
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell
lines harboring B-
Raf mutation [87]. In xenograft models, PD-0325901
demonstrated significant antitumor activity at a dose of
20–25 mg/kg/day with tumor shrinkage by 58% in PTC
cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement [88].

In a phase I, dose-escalation study of 30 patients with
multiple solid tumors, the DLTs were acneiform rash
involving face, trunk and arms at 30 mg twice daily.
Transient and reversible visual effects characterized by
blurred vision and halos were observed at ≥15 mg BID
[89,90]. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAE) included rash, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting. There were 1 PR (melanoma) and 5 SD
(4 melanomas, 1 NSCLC). In an open-label, phase II
study, patients with progressive, recurrent, or advanced
NSCLC were treated with15 mg PD-0325901 twice daily
[91]. There were no objective responses during the trial
period. Due to a lack of responses coupled with the
safety issues, the trial was closed after the first stage.
However, Pfizer initiated a new multi-arm phase 1
study in 2012 to test PF-04691502 and PF-05212384,
dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors
in combination with
PD0325901 or irinotecan in patients with advanced
cancer [NCT01347866].

Refametinib (RDEA119, BAY 869766)
Refametinib is
the only cyclopropane-1-sulfonamide
derivative, and exhibits a highly selective allosteric inhi-
bition of MEK 1/2 [92]. When dosed once daily for
14 days, refametinib showed potent activity in preclinical
xenografts of human melanoma A375, colon carcinoma
Colo205 and HT-29, pancreatic cancer OCIP19, 21, and
23, and skin carcinoma A431 tumor models [92,93].

In a phase I/II study of patients with advanced solid
tumors, refametinib was well tolerated at doses 100 mg

daily. Rash was the most common TEAE [94]. Subse-
quently, a phase II study enrolled seventy patients to
evaluate refametinib in combination with sorafenib as
first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular car-
cinoma (HCC) [95]. Of sixty-five patients analyzed for
efficacy per protocol, three (5%) had PR, and the median
time-to-progression was 4.1 months.

TAK733
TAK733 is a novel second-generation, allosteric kinase in-
hibitor with potent anti-MEK 1/2 activity [96]. In xenograft
models, TAK-733 exhibited broad antitumor properties
[96,97]. Phase I/II trials using TAK733 alone and in com-
bination with alisertib in advanced non-hematologic malig-
nancies are still accruing [NCT00948467, NCT01613261].

MEK162 (ARRY 438162)
MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is another novel, second gene-
ration inhibitor that targets MEK 1/2 [98,99]. A phase II
study examined MEK162 in 71 patients with N-Ras and
B-Raf mutated advanced melanoma patients.
It was
given as 45 mg twice daily. Disease control rates of 63%
and 51% were noticed in N-Ras and B-Raf mutant
melanoma patients, respectively. No complete response
was observed. Grade 3–4 adverse events include rash,
diarrhea, fluid retention and creatinine phosphokinase
(CPK) elevation [100]. A MEK162 analog, ARRY 300,
recently completed phase I testing in healthy volunteers
in the United States (NCT00828165).

RO5126766
As a novel, highly potent, first-in-class dual MEK/Raf
inhibitor, RO5126766 selectively binds to MEK 1/2 to
form a stable Raf-MEK-RO5126766 complex. Cell cycle
arrest was shown to be the primary mechanism for the
growth-inhibitory properties of RO5126766 in a panel of
human tumor cell lines [101].

A phase

I open-label, dose-escalation study of
RO5126766 was undertaken in 52 patients with ad-
vanced cancers [101]. Tolerability of RO5126766 was
similar to that of other MEK inhibitors and the most
common toxicities
included rash-related disorders,
elevated CPK, and diarrhea. The overall objective res-
ponse rate was 40% in forty-five patients. Of 21 patients
with metastatic melanoma included in the study, three
PR were seen in two B-Raf mutant melanomas and one
in an N-Ras mutant melanoma. The dose recommended
for phase II investigation was 2.7 mg daily 4 days on/
3 days off.

WX-554
WX-554 is another MEK 1/2 inhibitor. To determine
pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic parameters,
WX-554 is planned to be administered intravenously as

single doses in the range of 0.05 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg to
healthy volunteers in dose escalated manner [102]. Re-
sults of this study are not available yet. An oral formula-
tion of this inhibitor is being tested in a phase I/II trial
in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT01581060).

RO4987655 (CH4987655)
RO4987655 is a highly selective, small molecule MEK
inhibitor. The unique 3-oxo-oxazinane ring structure of
RO4987655 confers metabolic stability, This compound
showed slow dissociation from MEK with remarkable
antitumor efficacy, and insignificant MEK inhibition in
mouse brain, implying few CNS-related side effects in
human [103].

In a recently published phase I study of RO4987655,
MEK 1 inhibition in cancers was demonstrated by
decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Partial responses
and stable disease were achieved below MTD (8.5 mg
twice daily) mainly in patients with skin melanomas
[104]. DLTs were reversible grade 3 blurry vision and
grade 3–4 elevation of CPK. The compound alone is
currently undergoing further clinical development in an
expansion of this study [NCT00817518].

GDC-0973 (XL518)
A derivative of methanone, GDC-0973 is a potent, orally
bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of MEK 1 [105].
GDC-0973 showed strong antineoplastic activity in a B-
Raf and K-Ras mutant cancer cell lines [105-107].

In a phase I clinical trial of 46 evaluable patients, GDC-
0973 in combination with GDC-0941 induced PR in 3
patients (B-Raf melanoma, B-Raf pancreatic cancer, K-Ras
endometrioid cancer) and stable disease in 5 [108]. Safety
data showed that the DLTs were increase in serum lipase
and CK enzymes. Additional phase I-III clinical trials are
ongoing [NCT01689519, NCT01271803, NCT00996892,
NCT01271803, NCT01562275].

AZD8330 (ARRY-424704, ARRY-704)
AZD8330 (ARRY 704) represents a new member of
MEK1/2 inhibitors [109]. A large phase I trial of 82
patients with advanced solid tumors defined the MTD
to be 40 mg/day. Change in mental status was the dose
limiting toxicity. Other common TEAEs include rash,
fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. Disease control rate of
40% was demonstrated in this study. Mutation analysis
of Ras/Raf genes were not mandated by the study [110].

Conclusions and future directions
Four distinct MAP kinase signaling pathways involving 7
MEK enzymes have been identified. MEK1 and MEK2
are the prototype members of MEK family proteins.
Several MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials. Trametinib
is being evaluated by FDA for
the treatment of

metastatic melanoma. Targeted therapies with small mo-
lecular inhibitors for solid tumors and hematological
malignancies are moving quickly from bench to bedside
[111-113]. Combination of targeting agents against dif-
ferent signaling pathways may provide additional bene-
fits and warrant further clinical studies [114,115].
