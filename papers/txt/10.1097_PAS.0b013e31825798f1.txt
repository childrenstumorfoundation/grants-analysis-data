PNS tumors referred to our institution for a molecular analysis

NF2 gene, likely to synergize with SMARCB1 in PNS tumors,
was also analyzed.

Results: Patients‚Äô age ranged from 0 to 45 years (median age,
6.6 y). Neurological symptoms were observed in 7/12 cases with
radiologic features evoking a neuroblastic tumor in 6 cases and a
peripheral nerve tumor in 4 cases. The mean delay before di-
agnosis was 3 months. Histologic examination revealed rhab-
doid features in 11/12 tumors. All tumors showed a complete
loss of SMARCB1 expression. Interestingly, adjacent nervous
proliferation resembling neuroÔ¨Åbromas were observed in 3 cas-
es, suggesting a multistep transformation. Three tumors har-
bored a hemizygous deletion at the NF2 locus, but all NF2
sequences were normal.

Conclusions: We report the Ô¨Årst series of PNS RT. In patients
with aggressive PNS tumors, RT should be suspected, and anti-
SMARCB1 immunohistochemical analysis
should be per-
formed. SMARCB1 inactivation, occasionally associated with
NF2 deletion, might have oncogenic eÔ¨Äects in peripheral nerves.

R habdoid tumors (RTs) are aggressive malignancies of

early childhood, arising typically in the brain, kidney,
and soft tissues. The main genetic characteristic of this
malignancy is the biallelic inactivation of the SMARCB1
gene, observed in approximately 90% of RTs.6,45
SMARCB1 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene, and in-
activation of both copies in RTs leads to a total loss of its
expression.36 Hence, immunohistochemical analysis using
an anti-BAF47 antibody is currently used as an adjunct to
morphology for diagnosis.7,27,28 Although loss of nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 was initially believed to be highly
speciÔ¨Åc for RTs, a similar immunophenotype has recently
been reported in other malignancies leading to potential
nosological issues; however, epithelioid sarcomas,24 renal

medullary carcinomas,13 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosar-
comas,30 hepatoblastomas,38 and cribriform neuroepithelial
tumors22 actually seem to be distinct from RT from a
clinical and morphologic point of view, although sharing a
loss of SMARCB1 expression. Remarkably, among the
SMARCB1-deÔ¨Åcient tumors with nonrhabdoid diagnosis,
Hornick and colleagues reported 12/24 cases of epithelioid
MPNST (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) har-
boring a loss of SMARCB1 expression. This study was the
Ô¨Årst to report the link between peripheral nervous system
(PNS) tumors and loss of expression of SMARCB1 but
without molecular analysis.24

Strikingly, recent studies also showed that SMARCB1
germline mutations are the underlying cause of a subset of
familial and sporadic schwannomatosis and rare forms of
familial meningiomas.9,11,20,25,26,35,37,39 Schwannomatosis is
a genetic disorder characterized by the development of
multiple schwannomas in the fourth to Ô¨Åfth decade of life.
The occurrence of both RT and schwannomas within
families with a unique SMARCB1 germline mutation con-
Ô¨Årms that a common genetic disorder could be shared by
the molecular
these 2 types of
mechanisms elucidating how a germline SMARCB1 muta-
tion would lead to a benign late-onset PNS tumor or to an
early aggressive RT remain elusive. Moreover, Eaton et al16
recently described a familial case of RT initially diagnosed
as MPNST, illustrating that SMARCB1 germline mutation
may predispose not only to benign schwannoma but also to
malignant tumors of peripheral nerves with a rhabdoid
phenotype.

tumors.16,41 However,

Given the close vicinity of SMARCB1 and NF2 genes
on chromosome 22q, recent studies assessed the con-
comitant deletion of both genes in schwannomas harboring
22q large deletions. Interestingly, these studies demon-
strated that most SMARCB1-linked schwannomas show a
multistep biallelic alteration of both SMARCB1 and NF2
through a documented ‚Äú4-hit‚Äù mechanism.14,20,21,26,35,39,44
Altogether, these data suggest not only that SMARCB1
mutations play a critical role in the development of PNS
tumors but also that a synergistic action of SMARCB1 and
NF2 is a recurrent event.

Among the 150 RTs referred to our laboratory
during the last 12 years, we identiÔ¨Åed 12 SMARCB1-de-
Ô¨Åcient tumors potentially arising from the PNS. We
therefore aimed at characterizing these tumors in detail
from a clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and molecular
point of view. We speciÔ¨Åcally investigated hypothetical
similarities between these SMARCB1-deÔ¨Åcient nervous
tumors and other kinds of nervous tumors‚Äîthat is,
MPNST, neurofibromas, and schwannomas‚Äîthrough a
detailed morphologic description and combined molec-
ular analysis of NF2 and SMARCB1 genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Inclusion Criteria

For the cohort study, the samples were selected
from tumors referred from French pathology depart-
ments to our laboratory (Unite¬¥ de Ge¬¥ ne¬¥ tique Somatique,

Institut Curie) because of pathologic features that were
compatible with RT and therefore warranting a
SMARCB1 investigation according to the pathologist‚Äôs
discretion. From these approximately 150 samples, we
selected tumors for which (i) a biallelic inactivation of
SMARCB1 and/or a total loss of SMARCB1 protein
expression was actually registered, (ii) the anatomic origin
was pointed out to be the PNS by the pathologist, or (iii)
a diÔ¨Äerential diagnosis with MPNST, neuroÔ¨Åbroma, or
neurinoma was discussed in the pathologist‚Äôs report. Fi-
nally, 12 BAF47-negative tumors matched these selection
criteria and were considered for further description.

Clinical and Radiologic Characteristics

The clinical features that were assessed included:
personal oncological history, sex and age at presentation,
symptoms, location of the primary tumor, extension, Ô¨Årst-
line treatment modalities, and outcome. The time interval
from onset of symptoms to the tumor diagnosis was re-
corded. To conÔ¨Årm the PNS as the origin of the tumors,
radiologic data [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
computed tomography scan] were reviewed by a senior
radiologist (H.B.).

Pathologic Analysis

ParaÔ¨Én-embedded tissue was available for all pa-
tients. Representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides and initial immunostainings were initially reviewed
by 3 experienced pediatric pathologists (P.F., M.P., and
D.R.) according to the geographic provenance of the
patients. M.P. and P.F. then reviewed all cases blindly
and a consensus was reached. Immunohistochemical
staining for vimentin, pancytokeratin, epithelial mem-
brane antigen (EMA), glial Ô¨Åbrillary acidic protein, S100
protein, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was recorded for
all cases.

Immunohistochemistry (BAF47)

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on
formalin-Ô¨Åxed, paraÔ¨Én-embedded tissue, and the activity
of endogenous peroxidase was inhibited. The sections
were placed in Dako Target Retrieval Solution High pH
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and microwaved for antigen
retrieval. The sections were incubated with the primary
mouse monoclonal antibody BAF47 (BD Transduction
Laboratories, San Diego, CA) for 1 h (1/100 dilution) at
room temperature and washed with phosphate-buÔ¨Äered
saline solution. After incubation with the Bond Polymer
ReÔ¨Åne Detection kit (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd,
UK) and staining with 30-diaminobenzidine (Leica Bio-
systems Newcastle Ltd) as the chromogen, the slides were
counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
cover-slipped.

Molecular Studies

DNA was extracted from frozen tumors according
to classical procedures. All SMARCB1 and NF2 coding
exons and splice site regions were sequenced using the
Sanger method and the ABI automated Ô¨Çuorescent se-
quencer (primers and methods available on request).

summarized in Table 1. Mean age at diagnosis was 6.6
years (range, 0 to 45 y), and the diagnosis was made be-
fore 12 months in 2 patients. The tumors originated from
the sciatic nerve in 4 patients (Figs. 1A, B), from the
brachial plexus in 1 (Figs. 1C, D), from the thoracic
paravertebral sympathetic chain in 2 (Figs. 2A, B), from
the cervical sympathetic nerves in 3, and from the
acoustic-facial nerves
in 2
(Figs. 3A, B).

(pontocerebellar angle)

Eight patients presented at diagnosis with neuro-
logical symptoms lasting for several months (up to 1 y;
Supplementary Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1
http://links.lww.com/PAS/A117). In these cases, the di-
agnosis of RT was not primarily suggested because of
atypical location or slow-growing behavior (Table 1).

Radiologic Pattern

Radiologic review strongly suggested the PNS origin
of the tumor in all patients. The mean diameter of the
tumor was 5.8 cm (range, 1.5 to 9.5 cm). All tumors were
well-circumscribed. A solid (9/12) or mixed (3/12) (solid
and cystic) pattern was observed. Most tumors (10/12)
demonstrated a heterogenous density on computed to-
mography or a heterogenous signal
intensity on MRI,
without any speciÔ¨Åc component (ie, no calciÔ¨Åcation or fat).
Contrast enhancement was moderate to high in solid por-
tions. Central necrosis was obvious in the largest tumors.

According to radiologic features, a neuroblastic
tumor was the Ô¨Årst diagnosis evoked in 5 cases, a benign
neuroÔ¨Åbroma or an acoustic schwannoma was suggested
in 2 cases, and MPNST and peripheral primitive neuro-
ectodermal tumor were the Ô¨Årst diagnostic hypotheses in
patients 7 and 8, respectively.

Pathology
Morphologic Features of the Tumor Cells

On the basis of morphologic features, the initial
diagnosis was RT only in 5/12 tumors (initial diagnoses
by local pathologists are reported in Table 1). The ex-
perts‚Äô review conÔ¨Årmed a highly cellular, malignant, solid
neoplasm in all cases. Typical rhabdoid features, includ-
ing (i) diÔ¨Äuse proliferation, (ii) round or polygonal cells,
(iii) eccentric nuclei with prominent nucleoli and uncon-
densed chromatin, and (iv) eosinophilic cytoplasmic in-
clusions, were searched for. A completely rhabdoid
phenotype was observed in 8 centrally reviewed cases. A
partially rhabdoid phenotype (ie, when one of the pre-
vious items was not unambiguously found) was retrieved
in 3 other tumors, and a consensus was achieved to
conclude to a diagnosis of RT with incomplete features.
In patient 8 in particular, the diagnosis of RT was Ô¨Ånally
retained because of the presence of scattered rhabdoid
cells within undiÔ¨Äerentiated cells with partially rhabdoid
features.31 One malignant, poorly diÔ¨Äerentiated tumor
with nonrhabdoid features remained unclassiÔ¨Åable (pa-
tient 7, Supplementary Figure 2, Supplemental Digital
Content 2 http://links.lww.com/PAS/A118).

Peripheral Nerves

Pathologic analysis identiÔ¨Åed nervous structures in
6 cases: (i) sympathetic ganglion in 3 cases (patients 1, 3,
and 5; Figs. 2C, D); in patients 3 and 5, the tumor was in

its architecture; (ii) large nerves, compatible with both

SMARCB1 Deficiency in Tumors From the PNS

FIGURE 1. PNS tumors mimicking MPNST. MRI examination of patient 7: (A) coronal T2-WI and (B) axial T1-WI show a well-
circumscribed lesion (74 8 cm) displacing gluteus maximus muscle arising from the sciatic nerve. The tumor (arrows) appears
as a solid mass with isosignal on T1-WI as compared with muscles and heterogenous overall high signal intensity on T2-WI with
nodular low signal intensities. MRI examination of patient 2: (C) postcontrast axial T1-WI and (D) coronal T2-WI show a solid
dumbbell mass originating from the left C7-T1 foramen (spinal nerve and brachial plexus roots). The tumor (arrows) appears as a
solid well-circumbscribed mass (36.5 2 cm) with heterogenous overall high signal intensity on T2-WI with nodular high signal
intensities and heterogeneous enhancement after contrast media injection. Case 9: (E) coexistence in the same tumor of rhabdoid
cell components and structurally hyperplasic and disorganized nervous structures characterized by different orientations of the

normal nervous structures or benign nervous tumors, in 3
cases (patients 2, 9, and 11; Figs. 1E, F, 3C). The tumor in
patient 11 showed an intimate juxtaposition and mixture of
the diÔ¨Äerent cell components, that is: Schwann cells dis-
playing a normal morphology but abnormal proliferation
that resembles schwannoma (Fig. 3C),
fusiform cells
showing marked atypia compatible with MPNST features
(Fig. 3D), and Ô¨Ånally typical rhabdoid cells (Fig. 3E). The
tumors in patients 2 and 9, on the contrary, show a clear
delimitation between the
rhabdoid component and
abnormal proliferative nervous structures (Figs. 1E, G). In
these cases, the nervous structures were structurally dis-
organized, characterized by diÔ¨Äerent orientations of Ô¨Åbers,
both longitudinal and transverse, resembling the common
Ô¨Åndings of neuroÔ¨Åbromas (Figs. 1E, F).

Immunohistochemical Features

To further relate the tumors to the rhabdoid phe-
notype, mesenchymal (desmin and vimentin) and epi-
thelial markers (EMA and pancytokeratin) were recorded
for all tumors (Table 2). Vimentin, EMA, and pan-
cytokeratin stained positively in 8/12, 5/12, and 9/12
cases, respectively. Glial Ô¨Åbrillary acidic protein ex-
pression, assessed in the 2 intracranial (cerebellopontine
angle) tumors, was obvious in both cases.

To bring more arguments in favor of a presumably
nervous origin of the tumors, we also assessed the ex-

pression of S100 protein, a Schwann cell marker usually
expressed in benign nervous tumors and in 80% of epi-
thelioid MPNST.15,19,43 A positive S100 staining was ob-
served in 7/12 cases but exclusively in the Schwann cells.
As radiologic and morphologic Ô¨Åndings suggested a
sympathetic origin for some cases, we also investigated
whether the TH, a protein normally present in catechol-
amines secreting neurons and in neuroblastic tumors, was
expressed in the tumors in cases 1 to 6. Although an
obvious expression was observed in some ganglion neu-
rons in cases 1 and 5 (Fig. 2D), meanwhile conÔ¨Årming
intimate relations of the tumors with the sympathetic
system, no signiÔ¨Åcant staining was evidenced in the tumor
cells.

observed in all cases. Noticeably, tumor 10, which arose
in a 54-year-old adult, harbored a much higher number of
chromosomal
imbalances than the tumors arising in
younger patients (Fig. 4A).

SMARCB1 status is summarized in Table 3. Bial-
lelic inactivation was evidenced in 8/10 tumors tested. In 2
tumors, we could not discriminate between a genuine
heterozygous deletion and a homozygous deletion in tu-
mor cells diluted in a higher proportion of normal stro-
mal cells. No frozen sample was available for the 2
remaining tumors.

NF2 direct sequencing found no mutation in the
7/12 analyzed tumors. Nevertheless, focusing on the NF2
locus, SNP6 arrays allowed the detection of a hemizygous
deletion of the NF2 gene in 3 tumors (Fig. 4B).

Finally, as MPNSTs frequently show inactivation of
NF119,43 and given that RTs have occasionally developed
in an NF1 context,17 we also focused on the 17q11 region
on SNP arrays. Neither deletion nor copy neutral loss of
heterozygosity was evidenced at the NF1 locus.

DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the Ô¨Årst
to report alterations of SMARCB1 expression in a series
of pediatric PNS tumors. Given the recently enlarged
spectrum of SMARCB1 deÔ¨Åciency among malignant and
benign tumors,7,23 the Ô¨Årst aim of our study was to assess
whether these tumors were actual RTs. Our results
conÔ¨Årmed that 11/12 of these tumors matched with RT

lack of TH expression in sympathetic nervous system
tumors excludes a mature sympathetic neuron origin.
Negative or focal staining of S100 in 10 tumors dis-
tinguished their immunophenotype from that of common
benign Schwann cell‚Äìderived tumors and from epithelioid
MPNSTs, which are known to retain the S100 expression.
A second aim of the study was to ascertain the
nervous system origin of those tumors. Radiologic review
conÔ¨Årmed the PNS tumor origin in all cases. Moreover,
we unexpectedly observed some features compatible with
benign nervous proliferation within or near the rhabdoid
components. Given the recent works showing the links
between SMARCB1 germline mutations, acquired NF2
somatic inactivation in Schwann cells, and development
of schwannomas,9,11,20,25,26,35,37,39 a potential genetic re-
lationship between common PNS tumors‚Äîthat is, neu-
rofibromas, schwannomas, and MPNST‚Äîand our cases
actually required further investigation. Although NF2
constituted an attractive candidate gene, we found only 3
hemizygous deletions and no mutation. These results
should be put in light of previous studies showing fre-
quent 22q11 deletions in MPNST, without recurrent NF2
mutations being reported so far. However, because of
restricted biological samples, NF2 could be sequenced in
only 7/12 tumors, and a more exhaustive analysis would
be required; in particular, the 2 tumors arising in the
acoustic nerve, the most likely to be related to NF2 mu-
tations, could not be analyzed.

At least 3 hypotheses can be raised to explain the
coexistence of benign nervous structures and rhabdoid
proliferations:
1. Abnormal proliferation of normal Schwann cells as a
reaction to the presence of neoplastic components
nearby, as it is proposed for Schwann cells in neuro-
blastic tumors.2

2. A multistep malignant transformation of a preexistent
benign nervous lesion. In this hypothesis, the rhabdoid
features would be secondarily acquired from a primary
nonrhabdoid proliferation by the biallelic inactivation
of SMARCB1, as described in other glial tumors1,12
and as suggested by Carter et al11 in PNS. This
hypothesis of a multistep tumoral evolution might
account for the long delay between Ô¨Årst neurological
symptoms and diagnosis observed in some patients. In
particular, patient 11 had a tumor genuinely resem-
bling an acoustic schwannoma in MRI with some
histologic features strongly suggestive of that diag-
nosis, whereas features were typical for RT both on
MRI and histology a few months later. Similarly,
patient 5 (Fig. 4) had a 12-month-lasting clinical
history, a delay strikingly unexpected for RTs, which
are usually characterized by rapid and aggressive
symptoms.

3. The concomitant proliferation of diÔ¨Äerent lineages
arising from a common progenitor, as we previously
suggested in some neuroblastic tumors with abundant
Schwann cell proliferation.8 This hypothesis is plau-
sible, given that such composite features are described
in other pediatric malignancies, such as Triton tumors
or ectomesenchymomas.3,29,32 In that respect, our
observation would open new insights in a presumable
neural crest cell origin of some RTs.

Finally, our study brings some clinical information
with more practical aspects. Indeed, occurrence of RTs in
unusual locations has been reported, including mediastinum,
liver, neck, shoulder, and retroperitoneum.5,10,18,33,34 In a
large retrospective series of atypical nervous tumors, Strom
et al40 reported 1 case of PNS RT, and 2 other cases in-
volving third and Ô¨Åfth cranial nerves have been previously
described.4,46 Our observations suggest that a misdiagnosis

with other entities, such as neuroblastoma and schwannoma-
at least from a clinicoradiologic point of view-and epithelioid
MPNST on a pathologic aspect, should be anticipated.
Therefore, we recommend that anti-BAF47 immuno-
histochemistry should be widely performed in aggressive
tumors involving peripheral nerves, either in cases highly
suggestive of RT or in tumors of much less typical clinical
and pathologic diagnoses.
