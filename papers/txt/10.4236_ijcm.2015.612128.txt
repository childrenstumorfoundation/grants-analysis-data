Abstract 
The objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of intralesionally administered 
diclofenac in the treatment of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF1. This was a proof-of- 
concept, prospective, safety and efficacy study of the effect of intralesionally administered diclo-
fenac 25 mg/ml given once a week to 3 target cutaneous neurofibromas for 4 consecutive weeks. 
Overall, there was no significant change in neurofibroma size. During the study, some treated le-
sions developed signs of necrosis and fell off after a few weeks, but none of the control neurofi-
bromas fell off. There were no significant changes in patient’s vital signs. A few adverse events oc-
curred,  mostly  at  the  injection  sites.  During  the  study,  some  neurofibromas  developed  necrosis 
after the diclofenac injections and eventually detached from the patient. Overall, diclofenac was 
well tolerated, suggesting minimal systemic exposure, which required confirmation and further

1. Introduction 
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome with highly variable clini-
cal  manifestations  which  have  an  incidence  of  approximately  1/4000  worldwide.  NF1  is  extremely  variable, 
with numerous manifestations that may be presented at birth or may develop at any age [1]. The most common 
lesion in NF1 is the cutaneous neurofibroma, which appears on the skin in 90% of adults with NF1. Cutaneous 
neurofibromas are benign tumors, presumably of peripheral nerve sheath origin. Their number in an affected in-
dividual can range from a few to thousands. Cutaneous neurofibromas are uniformly benign and first appear on 
the torso around adolescence, but can appear anywhere in the dermis or subcutis [2].   

Cosmetic problems from cutaneous neurofibromas are a common complaint of NF1 patients [1]. Neurofibro-
mas may also cause itching and are occasionally painful [1]. The lesions can be removed surgically, but other 
lesions may develop and surgical removal is painful and leaves scars. Currently, there is no known treatment 
other than surgical removal by scalpel, electro-dessication or laser [1] [3].   

The superficial location of cutaneous neurofibromas makes them amenable to intralesional therapy. The ideal 
intralesional treatment will involve a compound that induces cutaneous neurofibromas to involute without scar-
ring and/or that prevents them from growing larger in size. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that also exhibits analgesic and antipyretic activity. Diclofenac and other NSAIDs inhibit the biosyn-
thesis of prostaglandins by preventing the substrate arachidonic acid from binding to the cyclooxygenase (COX) 
enzyme active site [3]. The COX enzyme  has two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed in the 
most cells and catalyzes the production of prostaglandins involved in numerous physiological functions, includ-
ing maintenance of renal function, mucosal protection in the gastrointestinal tract and pro-aggregatory throm-
boxane A2 in the platelets [4]-[6]. COX-2 is considered to be induced by cytokines and inflammatory mediators 
in various tissues, including endothelial cells. 

  When administered topically, diclofenac causes the clearance of actinic keratosis lesions. Topical diclofenac 
3% utilizes a gel vehicle to deliver the drug to the epidermis. The mechanism of action of topical diclofenac 3% 
gel  is  not  known,  but  the  topical  formulation  drug  has  been  shown  to  cause  inhibit  angiogenesis  and  induce 
neovascular regression in inflammatory tissue in animal models [7] [8]. Because cutaneous neurofibromas are 
benign lesions that rely on cellular proliferation, diclofenac potentially may inhibit their growth much like it ef-
fectively retards and induces involution of actinic keratoses. Such a local effect can result in an effective therapy 
that involves little cosmetic disfigurement and maximal safety. 

Diclofenac also exists as a 25 mg/ml injectable preparation (Voltaren® injection 75 mg/3ml ampoule). This 
formulation is approved in some countries for the treatment of pain as a result of renal colic, biliary colic, and 
migraine headaches [9]. Intralesional administration of diclofenac is not well-studied, with no recent reports in 
the literature that describe the use of this route of administration for the local treatment of any benign or malig-
nant tumor. Though cutaneous neurofibromas are easily accessible lesions, presently available topical gel for-
mulations of diclofenac are unlikely to penetrate the epidermis adequately to reach effective intralesional con-
centrations. Intralesional diclofenac may overcome this issue. For this reason, a novel use of injectable diclofe-
nac 25 mg/ml was explored in this study. A clear benefit of locally introduced diclofenac when compared to oral 
diclofenac was the targeted delivery of a significantly lower dose of drug to patients.   

In this study, over the course of 4 weeks, three different sized cutaneous neurofibromas were treated with dif-
ferent volumes of diclofenac 25 mg/ml. This served to assess a differential response to diclofenac depending on 
the size of the lesion. Control lesions of comparable differing sizes were also “mock”-treated with sterile normal 
saline. Prior to injection with diclofenac the target lesions were anesthetized with lidocaine 1% combined with 
epinephrine  1:100,000.  All  lesions  were  located  on  the  upper  back  in  order  to  minimize  the  negative  conse-

2. Objectives 
The objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of intralesionally administered diclofenac in 
the treatment of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF1.   

3. Material and Methods 
3.1. Subjects 
Seven (7)  adults  with  an  established diagnosis  of NF1  provided  informed  consent. All  subjects were  female, 
ages between 18 and 65, inclusive, who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding, who were otherwise healthy 
and possessing at least 6 cutaneous neurofibromas between 0.5 and 1.5 cm (measured in the largest dimension), 
inclusive, on the upper back. NF1 was defined as a genetic mutation involving the gene encoding neurofibromin 
confirmed by mutation analysis, or by fulfilling classical clinical criteria: the presence of any 2 of the following 
7 features: ≥ 6 café au lait macules on the body of greater than 15 mm in diameter in the longest dimension; two 
or more cutaneous neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma; freckling in axillary or inguinal regions; an 
optic glioma; two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), a distinctive osseous lesion of neurofibromatosis, 
such as sphenoid wing dysplasia, pseudoarthrosis of the tibia, macrocephaly, or scoliosis; and a first degree rela-
tive with NF1. 

All subjects were in good health or had stable concomitant medical conditions appropriately managed by a 
primary care physician. Enrolled subjects demonstrated no clinically significant abnormalities on both laborato-
ry and physical examination, other than for clinical signs of NF1. 

3.2. Material & Methods 
Diclofenac  25  mg/ml  (brand  name  Voltaren®,  obtained  from  Drogarias  Pacheco  Av.  Ataulfo  de  Paiva,  386 
Leblon—Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Brazil) was injected intralesionally once a week to 3 target cutaneous neurofibro-
mas for 4 consecutive weeks. After screening and enrollment, all subjects received a defined volume (based on 
the size of the lesion) of intralesional diclofenac 25 mg/ml once weekly into 3 target cutaneous neurofibromas 
that were 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter, inclusive, in its largest dimension.   

Each target cutaneous neurofibroma was different in size, with one 0.5 to 0.8 cm in diameter (referred to as 
T1), a second between 0.81 to 1.2 cm in diameter (T2), and a third 1.21 to 1.5 cm in diameter (T3). Concomi-
tantly, three control cutaneous neurofibromas found on the upper back of the same range in sizes received sterile 
normal saline (C1, C2, and C3, respectively). All lesions prior to injection were locally anesthetized with lido-
caine 1% and epinephrine 1:100,000. The volume of diclofenac 25 mg/mL or control solution injected into each 
neurofibroma was as follows: T1/C1: 0.2 ml; T2/C2: 0.3 ml; T3/C3: 0.4 ml. 

The study period lasted a total of 6 weeks, with a total of four patient visits: Screening/Baseline, Week 1, 
Week 2, Week 3, and Week 6. Patients were followed every week during receipt of the study medication and 
three weeks after the last dose had been administered. At every visit, subjects underwent serial physical exami-
nations, recording of adverse events and concomitant medications, and measurement and photography of both 
the target and control lesions. Assessment included the exact measured dimensions (in two axes) of the two as-
sessed lesions. Photography entailed standardized digital images of both the target and control lesions (accom-
panied by a measuring tape) without any identifying features of the subject represented. For each subject, pho-
tography involved consistent focal length, lighting, and angle of exposure carried over from visit to visit.   

During each visit, each subject was questioned for potential side effects of the receipt of the study medication 
either during its administration or in between visits, including pain, pruritus, irritation, discoloration, ulceration, 
or any other new sign or symptom-either local or distant from the target and control lesions-not present at baseline. 

3.3. Evaluation of Efficacy and Tolerability 
Safety was evaluated by adverse event monitoring (including but not limited to systemic side effects and ab-
normal  laboratory  evaluations)  and  dermatological  assessments  of  local  (at  the  treated  sites)  and  global  skin

reactions. Efficacy was evaluated with both physical measurement and photography of the target and control le-
sions at every visit after the baseline visit. 

At the screening visit, informed consent was obtained, inclusionary and exclusionary criteria were reviewed, 
and a full medical history, physical examination, and a baseline laboratory evaluation were performed. Subjects 
with the diagnosis of NF1 who had given informed consent, who met all of the inclusionary and exclusionary 
criteria, who were in good general health or with concomitant medical conditions that were stable and managed 
by a primary care physician, and who had no significant laboratory abnormalities, initiated the treatment period 
at a baseline visit which was within one week of the screening visit. Throughout the 7-week duration of the 
study no other established approaches to the treatment of cutaneous neurofibromas was allowed. Both the target 
and control cutaneous neurofibromas had not received therapy of any nature-surgical or medical-for at least 3 
months prior to study entry. 

At the screening visit, a full medical history was obtained, a complete physical examination, including vital 
signs, was recorded, concomitant medications were noted, and laboratory evaluations were performed. The la-
boratory evaluations included a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a comprehensive metabolic ex-
amination (not including lipid profile). A urinalysis was performed. Women of childbearing potential received a 
urine pregnancy test. In subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, target and control cutaneous neu-
rofibromas of the correct size and on the upper back were identified and noted-using measurements from ana-
tomical landmarks-in terms of exact location and size. 

Adverse events were monitored at all site visits, starting immediately after the patient had signed informed 
consent to participate in the study. The subjects were queried for any adverse events that occurred between visits. 
Concomitant medication use was monitored and recorded at screening evaluation and was continued throughout 
the course of the study, up to and including the final follow-up visit. Safety was evaluated by adverse event 
monitoring (including but not limited to systemic side effects and abnormal laboratory evaluations) and derma-
tological assessments of local and global skin reactions. To elicit adverse events, simple questions with minimal 
connotations were used as the initial questions at all evaluation points during the study. For example: 
•  How have you felt since your last visit? 
•  Have you had any health problems since you were last here? 
•  Have you had any unusual or unexpected worsening of your medical condition? 

Study  data  were  recorded  in  the  clinical  research  form  and  tabulated  in  Excel.  Continuous  variables  were 

analyzed using one-way ANOVA with the software GraphPad Prism 5.   

4. Results 
A total of 7 female patients, aged 46 to 56 years, were enrolled in the study. They were neither pregnant nor 
breast feeding, were otherwise healthy and possessing at least 6 cutaneous neurofibromas between 0.5 and 1.5 
cm. Throughout the 7-week duration of the study, no other established approaches to the treatments of cutaneous 
neurofibromas was allowed. 

At the screening visit, a full medical history was obtained, a complete physical examination, including vital 
signs, was recorded, concomitant medications were noted, and laboratory evaluations were performed. All sub-
jects were reevaluated during the 7-week duration of the study and, as shown below (Table 1), there were no 
significant changes in patients’ vital signs throughout the study.   

During the treatment period, adverse events were monitored at all the injection sites at every visit. All 7 pa-
tients presented with abnormal clinical labs during the study, one patient presented a cold and evidence of ne-
crosis in T3, one patient presented some flaccidity in C3, one patient presented asthma, necrosis on neurofibro-
ma on left hip and redness and exulceration in T2 (Table 2). 

All 6 cutaneous neurofibromas possessed between 0.5 and 1.5 cm in diameter, inclusive, in its largest dimen-
sion. Three target cutaneous neurofibromas were chosen for the treatment with the diclofenac injection and on 
the other three cutaneous neurofibromas were given the sterile normal saline injection. The results of these in-
jections are presented below (Table 3 and Table 4). 

Although with few exceptions there was no significant change in neurofibroma size, during the study some 
patients presented with signs of necrosis in the injection sites of the treated neurofibromas. After a few weeks, 
the neurofibromas that showed some necrosis eventually detached from the patient. The process can be visua-
lized in Figures 1-4. This process was not observed among the control neurofibromas.

5. Discussion 
Cutaneous neurofibromas can occur anywhere on the body, presenting a wide variation in their size, numbers 
and shape [10]-[12]. They occur in more than 95% of patients and are composed of all cell types found in the 
peripheral nerves [13]-[15]. Generally, they are dome-shaped, soft, fleshy and skin color tumors [10]. Cutaneous 
neurofibromas can cause extreme cosmetic disfigurement or discomfort [15]. Removal by an expert surgeon is 
the only type of treatment available so far, though aside from the electrodessication technique, most procedures 
leave scars and carry the risk of keloid formation [3].   

Nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs including diclofenac are most commonly used in inflammatory diseases, 
since they are effective in management of pain, fever, redness and edema arising as a consequence of inflam-
matory mediator release [16] [17]. In mice, they are capable of stimulating proliferation of hematopoietic stem 
cells, to enhance bone marrow and splenic hematopoiesis, and bone marrow erythropoiesis [18]. 

During our literary search, we did not find any source that contained diclofenac’s bioavailability after subcu-

taneous injection. 

During the course of treatment, there were no significant changes in vital signs and few adverse effects. Al-
though there was not an important alteration in size of the neurofibromas during the duration of the study, some 
patients presented with necrosis in the diclofenac injection sites and later the neurofibroma detached from the 
patient. This is a possible new type of treatment for cutaneous neurofibromas, but since our n was not vast-in- 
deed, limited sample size and inclusion of only female subjects were two important limitations of this study, we 
advise that further studies should be done on the subject. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that fu-
ture investigations include observations of changes in neurofibroma characteristics rather than focusing solely

on size when evaluating treatment efficacy. 

All patients had reduced total globulin at the final study follow-up visit, however, we do not believe that this 
finding was associated with the diclofenac treatment, as the alterations were noted 3 weeks after the last diclo-
fenac injections.   

Interestingly, there were no reports of gastrointestinal side effects which are the most commonly reported ef-
fects associated with systemic diclofenac usage [13]. It may be that given the relatively small doses of diclofe-
nac administered, systemic effects were kept to a minimum. Further studies testing serum diclofenac levels fol-
lowing this type of administration would be useful in confirming this observation.   

Subsequent histopathology analysis of the treated neurofibromas that was not a part of the original protocol 
but that was carried out (following Ethical Committee approval of a protocol amendment) due to necrosis ob-
served in the treated neurofibromas showed massive infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and lympho-
cytes) and thrombosis within or adjacent to the necrosis areas on the neurofibromas. Subtle changes in small 
blood vessels in relatively normal areas of the neurofibromas were also noted. No obvious increase in mast cell 
numbers was reported.   

6. Conclusion 
There were no significant changes in vital signs or patients well-being. The study did not show an important 
change in size reduction of the neurofibromas and in some cases, the neurofibroma grew despite the diclofenac 
injections. Nevertheless, some of the neurofibromas presented with necrosis and later on detached from the pa-
tient. Overall, diclofenac was well tolerated, suggesting minimal systemic exposure, which required confirma-
tion  and  further  studies,  including  bioavailability  analysis.  The  observed  necrosis  and  histopathology  results 
warranted further investigation of diclofenac as a treatment option for cutaneous neurofibromas, though optimal 
dose and delivery system remained to be established. 

7. Ethical Standards 
The study protocol was submitted to and approved by the UNIFESO Ethical Committee and was performed in 
accordance with the ethical standards outlined in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments, as 
well as local guidelines. All participants gave their informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.
