Abstract

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders causing learning
disabilities by mutations in the neurofibromin gene, an important inhibitor of the RAS pathway. In a mouse model
of NF1, a loss of function mutation of the neurofibromin gene resulted in increased gamma aminobutyric acid
(GABA)-mediated inhibition which led to decreased synaptic plasticity and deficits in attentional performance. Most
importantly, these defictis were normalized by lovastatin. This placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study
aimed to investigate synaptic plasticity and cognition in humans with NF1 and tried to answer the question
whether potential deficits may be rescued by lovastatin.
Methods: In NF1 patients (n = 11; 19–44 years) and healthy controls (HC; n = 11; 19–31 years) paired pulse
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study intracortical inhibition (paired pulse) and synaptic
plasticity (paired associative stimulation). On behavioural level the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) was used.
To study the effect of 200 mg lovastatin for 4 days on all these parameters, a placebo-controlled, double blind,
randomized trial was performed.
Results: In patients with NF1, lovastatin revealed significant decrease of intracortical inhibition, significant increase
of synaptic plasticity as well as significant increase of phasic alertness. Compared to HC, patients with NF1 exposed
increased intracortical inhibition, impaired synaptic plasticity and deficits in phasic alertness.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, a link between a pathological RAS pathway activity,
intracortical inhibition and impaired synaptic plasticity and its rescue by lovastatin in humans. Our findings revealed
mechanisms of attention disorders in humans with NF1 and support the idea of a potential clinical benefit of
lovastatin as a therapeutic option.

Background
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most com-
mon genetic disorders occurring in 1:3.000 persons. It is
caused by a loss of function mutation of the neurofibro-
min gene leading to rat sarcoma (RAS) pathway hyper-
activity [1,2]. Beside a wide range of symptoms caused by
RAS pathway, cognitive impairment is observed in about
30-65% of children with NF1 [3-5]. Furthermore, patients
with NF1 show a high frequency of attention deficit dis-
order (Hyman 38%, Mautner 49.5%) [6,7].

It is widely accepted that synaptic plasticity plays a
central role in all kinds of cognitive processes like learn-
ing and attention and, therefore, is discussed to be im-
paired in cognitive disorders. The pathophysiology of
cognitive deficits in NF1 has been studied using a mouse
model. NF1 mice show deficits in spatial learning and in
attention [8]. Although distinct underlying circuits and
brain mechanism mediate these different cognitive func-
tions, it has been shown that both, memory and atten-
tion are impaired by deficits in synaptic plasticity caused
by RAS pathway hyperactivity [9-11]. In interneurons,
where neurofibromin expression is critical for cognitive
function [4], increased RAS pathway activity causes GABA
release and subsequent diminishes synaptic plasticity in
mice [12]. Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), commonly used
for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, has been iden-
tified as potent inhibitor of RAS/mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase (MAPK) activity. Most importantly, down
regulation of the hyperactive RAS pathway by lovastatin
leads to an improvement of synaptic plasticity and restores
learning deficits and attention in mouse models of NF1.
In humans with NF1, Krab and colleagues performed a
12-week trial with simvastatin but could not improve cog-
nitive function in children with NF1 [13]. In contrast, an
open phase 1 study revealed an improvement of verbal
and non-verbal memory after three month lovastatin
treatment in children [14], which could be explained by a
specific function of lovastatin.

In animal models, synaptic plasticity is studied using
stimulation paradigms resulting in potentiation of synap-
tic transmission, so called long-term potentiation (LTP).
LTP can be induced by associative stimulation and is as-
sociated with learning a new motor skill [15]. Further-
more, studies using the NF1 mouse model as well as
others revealed strong RAS-pathway dependency of LTP
in the cell model [9,16,17].

In humans,

the term LTP-like plasticity has been
established [18,19]. It refers to neuronal plasticity of the
human motor cortex taking place on a synaptic level
which is associated to the acquisition of motor skills
[19-21]. LTP is studied by transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) and can be induced by associative stimulation
[19,22]. Furthermore, TMS can evaluate intracortical inhibi-

tion reflecting intracortical inhibition using a paired pulse
paradigm with a preceding subthreshold stimulus and
short interstimulus intervals (1–5 ms) [23].

In this placebo-controlled double blind study, we
aimed to investigate the potential impact of lovastatin
on synaptic plasticity, intracortical inhibition and atten-
tion in patients with NF1.

Results
As attention might influence PAS effects, we controlled
this in both cohorts and do not consider this as a con-
founding factor.

Exp 1a: synaptic plasticity
In this experiment we investigated PAS-induced LTP-like
plasticity in healthy controls and patients with NF1. Motor
evoked potentials increased in amplitudes in healthy con-
trols (baseline: 1.00 ± 0.17; POST 1: 1.44 ± 0.47; POST 2:
1.60 ± 0.71; POST 3: 1.71 ± 0.48), but not in patients with
NF1 after PAS (baseline: 1.03 ± 0.15; POST 1: 0.92 ± 0.43;
POST 2: 0.97 ± 0.33; POST 3: 0.98 ± 0.51; see Figure 1).
We performed rmANOVA on untransformed MEP data,
which revealed significant main effects (TIME: F[3;60] =
4.269, p = 0.011; GROUP: F[1;20] = 10.243, p = 0.004), and
significant interaction (F[3;60] = 5.854, p = 0.002). Post hoc
analysis demonstrated that the increase in MEP ampli-
tudes was significant in the control group for all points in
time (POST 1 (p = 0.009), POST 2 (p = 0.016) and POST
3 (p = 0.001)), but not in patients group and that there
were significant differences between both groups at POST
1 (p = 0.014), POST 2 (p = 0.015) and POST 3 (p = 0.002).
For more detail see also Figure 1.

There was no significant difference in baseline MEP
amplitudes between groups (NF1: 1.03 ± 0.15 mV; healthy
controls: 1.00 ± 0.17 mV; p = 0.782). Healthy controls and
patients did not differ in regard to resting motor threshold
(NF1: 39.55 ± 7.42%; healthy controls: 38.36 ± 6.02%;
p = 0.686) or perceptual threshold (NF1: 0.54 ± 0.22 mA;
controls: 0.61 ± 0.17 mA; p = 0.430). RmANOVA of rest-
ing motor threshold data revealed no significant main
effects or interaction (TIME: F[3;60] = 0.263, p = 0.844;
GROUP: F[1;20] = 0.612, p = 0.444; TIME*GROUP: F[3;60] =
0.819, p = 0.484).

Exp. 1b: intracortical inhibition
In experiment 1b we tested intracortical inhibition in pa-
tients with NF1 and healthy controls. Patients with NF1
showed an increased SICI compared to healthy controls
(ISI of 2 ms: 0.75 ± 0.33 to 0.51 ± 0.22 (p = 0.190), 3 ms:
0.77 ± 0.46 to 0.51 ± 0.24 (p = 0.190), 5 ms: 0.95 ± 0.41 to
0.69 ± 0.20, (p = 0.089), and over all ISI: 0.82 ± 0.40 to
0.57 ± 0.23, (p = 0.012; see Figure 2)).

Exp. 1c: attention
In experiment 1c attentional performance was examined in
patients with NF1 and healthy controls. In most subscales
of the test of attentional performance task (TAP) patients
with NF1 scored in lower ranges than healthy controls (see
Figure 3). Notably, deficits became manifest in the sub-
scales alertness (−WT, +WT) and Visual Scanning (critical
stimulus) where 10.33% (−WT), 9.53% (+WT) respectively
23.86% (critical stimulus). Here, the present sample scores
were significantly (Alertness: -WT: 0.003; +WT: 0.012; Vis-
ual Scanning: critical stimulus: 0.047) lower than in healthy
controls. In both conditions of alertness, with and without
a warning tone, we observed significant faster reaction
times in the healthy control group than in the patients
group (without warning tone (−WT): HC: 216.9 ±
16.02 ms; NF1: 239.3 ± 12.3 ms; unpaired t-test: p = 0.003,
with warning tone (+WT): HC: 218.2 ± 17.87 ms; NF1:
239 ± 15.26; unpaired t-test: p = 0.012).

Exp2: placebo controlled double blind intervention with
lovastatin
Exp 2a synaptic plasticity
This experiment
investigated PAS-induced LTP-like
plasticity in patients with NF1 in an on/off-medicated
condition with lovastatin.

Prestudy After a single dose of 200 mg of lovastatin,
there was a trend towards increased MEP amplitudes after
PAS in patients with NF1 (baseline: 1.06 ± 0.11; POST 1:
1.05 ± 0.43; POST 2: 1.15 ± 0.56; POST 3: 1.25 ± 0.80)
which did not reach significance (data not shown).

Main study After a four day course of lovastatin, an in-
crease of MEP after PAS was seen but not after placebo
(NF1-lovastatin: baseline: 1.03 ± 0.14, POST 1: 1.44 ± 0.52,
POST 2: 1.31 ± 0.63, POST 3: 1.39 ± 0.73; NF1-placebo:
baseline: 1.05 ± 0.22, POST 1: 0.84 ± 0.47, POST 2: 0.80 ±
0.41, POST 3: 0.92 ± 0.33; see Figure 4). RmANOVA on
untransformed MEP data of
lovastatin- and placebo-
medicated patients with NF1 revealed significant main
effects in DRUG (F[1;20] = 7.730, p = 0.012) and DRUG ×
TIME interaction (F[3;60] = 2.925, p = 0.047), but not in
TIME alone (F[3;60] = 0.500, p = 0.666). Post hoc ana-
lysis demonstrated that there was a significant differ-
ence between NF1-lovastatin and NF1-placebo in
POST 1 (p = 0.016), POST 2 (p = 0.041) but not in POST
3 (p = 0.065).

There was no significant difference in baseline MEP
amplitudes (NF1-placebo: 1.05 ± 0.22 mV; NF1-lovastatin:
1.03 ± 0.14 mV; p = 0.762),

RmANOVA of resting motor threshold data revealed no
significant main effects or interaction (TIME: F[3;60] = 1.720,

Exp. 2b: intracortical inhibition
Here we examined the influence of lovastatin and pla-
cebo on intracortical
inhibition in patients with NF1.
Comparing SICI after a four day course of lovastatin and
after a four day course of placebo patients with NF1 did
show lower SICI after lovastatin compared to placebo
(inter-stimulus-intervall of 2 ms: 0.58 ± 0.30 to 0.52 ± 0.22
(p = 0.415); 3 ms: 0.66 ± 0.34 to 0.51 ± 0.24 (p = 0.221);
5 ms: 0.99 ± 0.24 to 0.69 ± 0.20 (p = 0.017); all: 0.74 ± 0.34
to 0.57 ± 0.23 (p = 0.011; see Figure 2). Furthermore
differences in SICI between patients after a 4-day
course of lovastatin compared to healthy controls were
not seen (2 ms: 0.75 ± 0.33 to 0.58 ± 0.30 (p = 0.315);
3 ms: 0.77 ± 0.46 to 0.66 ± 0.34 (p = 0.684); 5 ms: 0.95 ±
0.41 to 0.99 ± 0.24 (p = 0.481); all: 0.82 ± 0.40 to 0.74 ± 0.34
(p = 0.734).

Exp. 2c: attention as measured with TAP in patients with
NF1, intervention with lovastatin
In experiment 2c we tested the effect of lovastatin on
attentional performance in patients with NF1. Here pa-
tients with NF1 demonstrated faster reaction times after
administration of the drug in the case of the condition
with a warning tone but not without the warning tone
(see Figure 5). In the condition with the warning tone,
the reaction time was significantly shorter (from 240.5 ±
21.69 ms at baseline to 226.9 ± 18.3 ms after lovastatin
administration, p = 0.004,
significance after
Bonferroni-Holm adjustment: p ≤ 0.007), whereas pla-
cebo had no effect (baseline: 233.1 ± 13.45 ms to 235.4 ±
17.91 ms).

Discussion
The main finding of the present placebo-controlled, ran-
domized double blind study is that lovastatin normalizes
LTP-like plasticity, decreases intracortical inhibition and
improves phasic alertness in patients with NF1.

Impaired LTP-like plasticity, has also been described
in neuropsychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease [24], in patients with schizophrenia [25] as well as
in patients with Parkinson’s disease [26,27]. Taking into

account that synaptic plasticity is regarded as central me-
chanism of learning and memory, impairment in neuro-
psychological disorders may be consequent. Results of our
study revealed a RAS pathway specific impaired LTP-like
plasticity in humans that was improved by a pathway spe-
cific pharmacological
intervention with lovastatin in a
placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind design.

Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), has been shown to re-
duce RAS-pathway hyperactivity in NF1 mice [8,28] and

in consequence to restore synaptic plasticity, normalize in-
hibition and to improve learning disability and attention.
Therefore, we performed a placebo-controlled random-
ized study. Indeed, a 4-day course of lovastatin normalized
increased intracortical inhibition, improved LTP-like plas-
ticity and alertness in patients with NF1, whereas placebo
intervention exposed no effects. Because of the placebo-
controlled randomized double blind cross over design,
confounding factors such as differences in attention were
best possible excluded. It supports the assumption that

lovastatin as a pathway specific intervention is responsible
for our finding which may elucidate the role of the RAS
pathway in LTP-like plasticity.

The concept of LTP-like plasticity is based on the as-
sumption that effects of paired associative stimulation on
MEP amplitudes show comparable attitudes as associative
plasticity in in vitro studies:long-lasting,
input-specific,
N-Methyl-D-Aspartat (NMDA)-receptor dependent, rap-
idly evolving, fully reversible, and bidirectional. This study
contributes significantly to this concept. In vitro it has
been shown that RAS-pathway activity is significantly re-
lated to LTP induction which has now been shown to be
the case for LTP-like plasticity as well.

In healthy subjects, we recently demonstrated that
increasing intracortical
inhibition by repetitive slow
frequency (0.1 Hz) TMS diminishes the induction of
LTP-like plasticity [21]. On the other hand, decreasing
intracortical inhibition has been shown to improve in-
duction of synaptic plasticity [29]. These findings lead to
the concept of a balance between gating and anti-gating
of synaptic plasticity which is regulated by intracortical
inhibition [30] and which may conclusively explain our
results. First,
inhibition in pa-
tients with NF1 compared to healthy controls may lead
to a reduction of LTP-like plasticity (increased anti-

increased intracortical

gating). Second, decrease in intracortical
inhibition
through lovastatin may lead to an improvement of LTP-
like plasticity (shift toward gating). This hypothesis is
supported by our findings of a decreased intracortical in-
hibition through lovastatin showing a significant de-
crease at the interstimulus interval of 5 milliseconds and
a trend of a decrease at 2 and 3 milliseconds, although
the lack of significance of the latter has to be taken as a
limitation.

This raises the question of the impact of lovastatin on
behavioural parameters. Attention has been shown to be
impaired in RAS pathway hyperactivity, to be related to
intracortical inhibition on a neurophysiological basis and
decreased synaptic plasticity and it has been shown
to be sensitive to pharmacological
interventions. This
makes attention to a predestined parameter to evaluate
cognition after a shot term intervention in RAS pathway
disorders with lovastatin. We postulated to find im-
pairments of behavioural parameters in our cohort of
patients with increased intracortical inhibition and de-
creased synaptic plasticity. Indeed, we observed deficits
in tonic (reaction time without WT) and phasic alertness
(reaction time with WT) as well as deficits in visual
scanning in patients with NF1 compared to healthy con-
trols. Additionally, we demonstrated phasic alertness to

be significantly improved after a 4-day course of lovastatin.
However, the time period of pharmacological intervention
was short. Phasic alertness – the ability to increase atten-
tion for a short time period on demand - may be con-
sidered as one of the most basic cognitive tasks examined
in our study and, therefore, may be responsive even to a
short term intervention. More complex tasks, such as
tonic (continued) alertness, visual scanning, incompatibil-
ity and impulsivity may need a longer time period to

respond to pharmacological intervention. Recently, in an
open phase 1 study focusing on a safe dosage of lovastatin
in children with NF1, an improvement of verbal and non-
verbal memory after three month lovastatin treatment was
observed [14].

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study demonstrated, for the first time,
that RAS-pathway specific modulation by lovastatin,

given in a placebo-controlled, randomized double blind
design, restores LTP-like plasticity, decreases intracortical
inhibition and improves phasic alertness in patients with
NF1. This study may be interpreted as a “proof of
principle” study elucidating pathophysiology of cognitive
impairment in NF1 and raises the question of the poten-
tial therapeutic impact of lovastatin in NF1. Our study
may encourage clinical trials answering this question.

Methods
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of
the University Hospital of Freiburg (41/08), Germany and all
subjects gave written informed consent. It was conducted
according to the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Experimental design
Experiment 1 (Exp. 1): Comparing healthy subjects and
patients with NF1
We compared healthy subjects with patients with NF1
testing the hypothesis whether patients with NF1 (a)
show impairment of synaptic plasticity as tested by the
TMS paradigm of Paired associative stimulation (PAS;
for experimental design see Figure 6), (b) show increased
level of intracortical
inhibition as tested by the TMS
paradigm of short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and
(c) have an attention deficit as tested with the test for at-
tentional performance (TAP) using the domains alert-
ness, visual scanning, go/no go and incompatibility. In
Exp 1b and 1c healthy subjects were compared to the
placebo group (NF1 patients) of Exp 2b and 2c in order
to reduce the testing time of each patient and minimize
retesting carry-over effects.

Since experiments may interfere with each other con-
cerning influence in attention and compliance as well as
the total amount of transcranial magnetic stimuli before
PAS and influence of PAS on intracortical inhibition, the
subparts a, b and c in both experiments were performed
separately with a time delay of at least two weeks [31].

Experiment 2 (Exp. 2): placebo controlled double blind
intervention with lovastatin
We performed a pre study using a single dose of 200 mg
of lovastatin. Because we found a trend but not a signi-

ficant effect on synaptic plasticity as measured by PAS
(data not shown) the placebo-controlled, double blind
main study was performed with 200 mg lovastatin daily
for four days before the experiments. Although this dos-
age is significantly higher than the clinical routine dose, it
was considered to be save as previously shown [32]. In-
deed none of our patients reported of any side effect at all.
The study was divided into three sub studies (2a-2c) using
the same testing procedure as in Exp1.

Subjects
Patients with clinically diagnosed neurofibromatosis type
1 (Exp. 1a: n = 11, mean age 28.0 (range 17–44) years,
Exp. 1b: n = 10, 27.8 years (range 19–44), Exp. 1c: n = 10,
27.8 years (range 19–44)) according to the criteria of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH, 1988) participated in
this study. Patients with NF1 and healthy controls were
not treated with psychotropic medications. Inclusion cri-
teria were age 18 to 45 years and right-handedness. Ex-
clusion criteria were segmental NF1, deafness, severely
impaired vision, use of central active drugs (e.g. methyl-
phenidate). The control group in Exp. 1 consisted of
age-matched healthy volunteers (Exp. 1a: n = 11, 24.73 ±
3.58 years, 5 female, 6 male (range 18–31 years) Exp. 1b:
n = 10, 23.3 ± 3.77, 6 female, 4 male (range 19–30 years)
aged; Exp. 1c: 22.0 ± 2.31, 6 female, 4 male (range 20–
26 years). All subjects were self-reported right-handed
and did not fulfil any exclusion criteria concerning the
safety of TMS [33].

Electromyographic recording
Subjects were seated comfortably in an armchair with
their stimulated hand resting on a cushion. Motor-evoked
potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the left abductor
pollicis brevis (APB) muscle at rest by surface electro-
myography (EMG) using silver/silver chloride electrodes
with a surface area of 263 mm2 (AMBU, Ballerup,
Denmark) in belly-tendon recording technique. Data were
band-pass filtered (20 – 2000 Hz) and amplified using an
Ekida DC universal amplifier (EKIDA GmbH, Helmstadt,
Germany), digitised at 5 kHz sampling rate using a
MICRO1401mkII data acquisition unit
(Cambridge

and later offline analysis using Signal Software version
3 (CED Ltd, UK).

Transcranial magnetic stimulation
For focal transcranial magnetic stimulation the intersec-
tion of a figure eight shaped stimulation coil with an ex-
ternal wing diameter of 90 mm was centred tangentially
on the scalp over the motor cortex with its handle
pointing in a posterior direction and laterally at an angle
of approximately 45° away from the midline. Thus the
current in the brain induced by magnetic stimulation
was in a posterior-anterior direction, roughly perpen-
dicular to the central sulcus and was therefore optimal
for activating the neurons of the corticospinal pathways
transsynaptically [34,35]. The coil was connected to a
Magstim 200 Stimulator (The Magstim Company Ltd,
Whitland, UK) which outputs a monophasic current
waveform. By moving the coil over the motor cortex
while administering stimuli of suprathreshold intensity,
we could identify the optimal position for eliciting MEPs
of maximum amplitudes from the target muscle (“hotspot”).
The individual hotspot was recorded using an optically
tracked navigation system (camera: NDI, Waterloo,
Ontario, Canada; software: Fraunhofer Institute (IPA),
Stuttgart, Germany) described previously [36] and thus
kept constant throughout investigations. Magnetic stim-
uli were administered to the cortex at a frequency of
0.1 Hz, except stimuli used to identify the hotspot and
motor threshold, which were administered at 0.25 Hz.
We determined the resting motor threshold using a
maximum-likelihood threshold-hunting procedure [37,38].
We used 16 TMS stimuli starting at 45% of maximum
stimulator output. A positive MEP was defined as a
muscle activation of >50 μV. The initial stimulator output
for evaluation was chosen to target a mean MEP ampli-
tude of 800–1200 μV (SI1mV) and was then kept constant
throughout the investigations to assess changes in MEPs.
MEP size was determined by measuring the two highest
peaks of opposite polarity [29,39,40] and then averaged
over 20 trials for each point of investigation. Subjects were
asked to relax the target muscle during all measurements
and relaxation was monitored by visual
feedback via
EMG-baseline.

Paired associative stimulation (PAS)
Paired associative stimulation consisted of 200 pairs at a
frequency of 0.25 Hz of peripheral electric stimulation of
the left median nerve at the wrist, followed by TMS of
the right M1 at the optimal site to elicit MEPs in the left
APB muscle [41]. Electrical stimulation was applied
through a Digitimer DS7 electrical stimulator (Digitimer
Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfortshire, UK) using a bi-
polar electrode with the cathode proximal. We identified

the optimal stimulation site at the wrist, affixed the elec-
trode, and determined the threshold of perception. During
PAS, constant current square wave pulses with duration of
1000 μs were applied at an intensity of three times the
perceptual threshold. We employed the intensity for TMS
which produced MEP amplitudes of, on average, 1 mV be-
fore the intervention (SI1mV). The same intensity was used
for evaluation. The ISI between electrical and transcranial
magnetic stimulation was 25 ms as this interval induces
an increase in MEP amplitudes [19].

One crucial point when applying PAS is the subject’s
attention level. It may influence the PAS effect’s magni-
tude. To avoid potential influence of attention on the re-
sults, we constantly reminded all the subjects to focus
their attention on the stimulated hand and mentally count
the number of electric stimuli. This assured a comparable
level of attention between both groups (i.e. HC and NF1).
Additionally, none of the patients reported of any diag-
nosed or relevant attention deficit in daily life.

As application of a high number of TMS stimuli might
influence subsequent induction of plasticity [21], we lim-
ited the number of pre-interventional TMS stimuli in all
experiments to 200. Each subject participated in studies
of PAS where we measured MEP amplitudes and resting
motor threshold before (PRE) as well as at three points
in time after PAS (POST 1, POST 2 and POST 3). For
experimental design see Figure 6.

Short interval cortical inhibition
All experiments were performed by TMS with the target
muscle at rest. To evoke SICI, a subthreshold condition-
ing stimulation was delivered 2, 3 and 5 ms before a test
stimulus [23]. The stimulator output for test stimulus
was adjusted to evoke mean MEP amplitude of 1 mV
peak-to-peak.

The standard protocol for SICI has been optimized to
maximize inhibitory effects of the preceding, condition-
ing stimulus using an intensity of 80% of resting motor
threshold [42]. Using this paradigm increased inhibition
in patients with NF1 compared to healthy subjects may
not be detected because of a ceiling effect. Because it is
known, that decreasing the conditioning stimulus inten-
sity is lowering the inhibitory effect, we first created an
intensity curve for SICI by using randomized condition-
ing stimulus intensities in trials of 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65,
0.7, 0.75 and 0.8 resting motor threshold [43,44]. Then
we selected the stimulus intensity with lowest but still
significant inhibition in the control group. This was the
case using a conditioning stimulus intensity of 0.60 resting
motor threshold (60%: 0.83 ± 0.42 to 0.58 ± 0.27, p = 0.017;
55%: 1.03 ± 0.51 to 1.0 ± 0.57, p = 0.575). This intensity
was used to test the hypothesis (i) whether inhibition in
patients with NF1 is increased and (ii) whether lovastatin
leads to a disinhibition in patients with NF1.

Page 10 of 12

With an interval of 4 s between trials, 10 conditioned
MEPs were collected for each ISI, and in each experi-
mental trial a total of 5 unconditioned test stimulus
MEPs were recorded. Thus, for each conditioning pulse
intensity 35 trials MEPs were recorded (3 ISIs with 10
MEPs each and 5 unconditioned MEPs). The order of
data acquisition for each conditioning pulse intensity
was randomized between subjects. The average of the
amplitude of each conditioned MEP was expressed as a
percentage of the average test stimulus MEP amplitude
in the same session.

Test for attentional performance (TAP)
Attention was measured through a computerized, stan-
dardized neuropsychological test, the TAP [45]. This test
is widely used to evaluate attentional deficits including
NF1. In order to be analogous to statin-responsive tests
in animal studies of NF1, we choose four subtests of
TAP: alertness and Go/No Go for basic attention and
general anticipation; visual scanning for visual-spacial
perceptivity (analogous to the morris water maze task
for visual-spatial
incompatibility for divided
visuospacial attention (analogous to the lateralized reac-
tion time task).

learning);

Alertness
In this test, reaction time is examined under two condi-
tions. The first condition concerns simple reaction time
measurements, in which a cross appears on the monitor
a randomly varying intervals and to which the subjects
should respond as quickly as possible by pressing a key.
Intrinsic alertness is measured in this condition. In a
second condition, reaction time is measured in response
to a critical stimulus preceded by a cue stimulus pre-
sented as warning tone (WT). Thus, alertness is equiva-
lent to anticipation and a degree of impulsiveness. It is
the pre-requisite for effective behaviour, and is in this re-
spect the basis of every attention performance.

Visual scanning
In the visual scanning task, a matrix-like arrangement of
5 × 5 stimuli is used. Subjects have to “scan” this matrix
and decide whether this arrangement includes a critical
stimulus or not. One reaction key is used for the answer
“present” and another for the answer “not present”.
Thus, visual scanning tests the exploration of the special
environment, which is one of the basic abilities subserv-
ing the safe movement in space.

Go/No Go
In the go/no-go tasks, the subject has to react selectively
to one class of stimuli but not to others. For testing a
go/no-go-task was realized with 2 stimuli, squares with
different textures, where two were targets. The aim of

this examination is an assessment of the capacity of fo-
cused attention (reject irrelevant information). Thus, the
go/no-go task tests the ability to suppress an inappropri-
ate reaction, that is, control of impulsive behaviour.

Incompatibility
In the incompatibility task, a right or left pointing arrow
appears in the left or right side of the visual field. Here,
the subjects have to press the button for the direction of
the arrow but not the site where the arrow appears. This
procedure tests the interference tendency in terms of
stimulus-reaction incompatibility.

Pharmacological intervention and randomization
procedure
We performed the study in a placebo-controlled, ran-
domized and double blind design for pharmacological
interventions. Patients obtained 5 tablets containing
40 mg lovastatin (Mevacor, 1 A Pharma®) or placebo
(lactose-monohydrate, magnesium stearate,
cellulose
powder). Patients and all other investigators were blind
to the treatment allocation. Tablets were given every day
at the same time at the day of examination, 2.8 h before
PAS started. This was done because the time to reach
peak plasma concentration is 2.8 hours [46]. Because
this was a short term administration and the aim of this
study was “proof of principle”, a dosage exceeding the
clinical routine dosage was administered. It has been
shown that doses of 200 mg of lovastatin were proven to
be save in adult human volunteers [32], moreover over-
dose up to 5–6 g have been tolerated with no specific
symptoms and recovery without sequelae. None of the
participants reported any side effects.

Data analysis
We ensured comparable relaxation in the recorded
muscle while recording the TMS measurements visually.
In addition, we investigated offline the EMG baseline of
each trial. Pre-facilitated trials were excluded from fur-
ther analyses. Trials that differed by over twice the
standard deviation from the mean were left out of the
analysis. We computed all statistical analyses using SPPS
version 15.0 Software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Be-
fore any further analysis, data were tested for normality.
For experiments 1, statistical evaluation was performed
via a repeated-measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA)
with group (two levels: CONTROL and NF1) as between
subject factor and time (four levels: PRE, POST 1, POST
2 and POST 3) as within-subjects factor. For experiment
2, we performed rmANOVA with drug (two levels: ON
and OFF) and time (four levels: PRE, POST 1, POST 2
and POST 3) as within-subject factors. We used the
Greenhouse-Geisser correction to adjust for violations
of sphericity, if necessary. In case of significant main

effects, we employed post-hoc two-tailed Student’s paired
or unpaired t-tests without correction. This method was
used for MEP and resting motor threshold values. To ana-
lyse baseline parameters, we used two-tailed Student’s
paired t tests. We compared baseline MEP amplitudes
using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with ex-
periment as factor. MEP amplitudes of each subject in
experiment 2 were analysed using an rmANOVA with
TIME (four levels: PRE, POST 1, POST 2 and POST 3)
as within-subject factor. The significance level was set
at 0.05 in all analyses. All values given are mean group
values ± standard deviation, if not indicated otherwise.
