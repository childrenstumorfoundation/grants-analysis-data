Introduction: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a primary immunodeﬁ ciency characterized by 
eczema, thrombocytopenia, infections, and a high risk of developing autoimmunity and cancer. In a 
recent clinical trial, a γ-retroviral vector was used to introduce a functional WAS gene into autologous 
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs), followed by reinfusion of the gene-corrected HSCs into the 
patients. This strategy provided clinical beneﬁ t but resulted in expansion and malignant transforma-
tion of hematopoietic clones carrying vector insertions near oncogenes, thus increasing leukemia risk. 
We have developed a clinical protocol for WAS based on lentiviral vector (LV) gene transfer into HSCs. 

Methods: Three patients with WAS were treated in a phase I/II clinical trial with gene-corr ected 
HSCs after pretreatment with a reduced-intensity myeloablative regimen. Autologous CD34+ cells 
were transduced with an optimized LV carrying the WAS gene under the control of its endogenous 
promoter. Patients were monitored for up to 2.5 years after gene therapy by molecular, immunologi-
cal, and clinical tests. We also investigated the genomic distribution of LV integration sites in the 
patients’ bone marrow and peripheral blood cell lineages.

Results: Administration of autologous HSCs transduced with LV at high efﬁ ciency (>90%) resulted 
in robust (25 to 50%), stable, and long-term engraftment of gene-corrected HSCs in the patients’ 
bone marrow. WAS protein expression was detected in myeloid cells at similar rates and in nearly 
all circulating platelets and lymphoid cells. In vitro T cell proliferative responses, natural killer cell 
cytotoxic activity, immune synapsis formation, and suppressive function of T regulatory cells were 
normalized. In all three patients, we observed improved platelet counts, protection from bleeding 
and severe infections, and resolution of eczema. Vector integration analyses on >35,000 unique 
insertion sites showed distinct waves of HSC clonal output, resulting in highly polyclonal multilineage 
hematopoietic reconstitution. In contrast to γ-retroviral gene therapy, our LV-based therapy did not 
induce in vivo selection of clones carrying integrations near oncogenes. Consistent with this, we did 
not see evidence of clonal expansions in the patients for up to 20 to 32 months after gene therapy. 

Discussion: Our gene transfer protocol provided efﬁ cient stem cell transduction in vitro, result-
ing in robust and stable in vivo gene marking. WAS expression was restored to near-physiological 
levels in the patients, resulting in immunological and hematological impr ovement and clinical 
beneﬁ t. Clonal tracking of stem cell dynamics by vector insertions showed details of hematopoietic 
reconstitution after gene therapy. Comparison with clinical data from 
γ-retroviral gene therapy in the same disease setting strongly suggests 
that LV gene therapy offers safety advantages, but a longer follow-up 
time is needed for validation. Collectively, our ﬁ ndings support the use 
of LV gene therapy to treat patients with WAS and other hematological 
disorders.

Analysis of common insertion sites (CIS) in gene ther apy trials using 
lentiviral versus  γ-retroviral vectors. Word clouds show the intensity of 
insertion sites clustering in each of the CIS genes (the larger the gene name, the 
larger the number of insertion sites within or in the proximity of that gene). The 
names of the CIS genes detected in both gene therapy trials are reported at the 
intersection between the circles.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an inherited immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the
gene encoding WASP, a protein regulating the cytoskeleton. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cell (HSPC) transplants can be curative, but, when matched donors are unavailable, infusion of
autologous HSPCs modified ex vivo by gene therapy is an alternative approach. We used a lentiviral
vector encoding functional WASP to genetically correct HSPCs from three WAS patients and
reinfused the cells after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. All three patients showed
stable engraftment of WASP-expressing cells and improvements in platelet counts, immune
functions, and clinical scores. Vector integration analyses revealed highly polyclonal and
multilineage haematopoiesis resulting from the gene-corrected HSPCs. Lentiviral gene therapy
did not induce selection of integrations near oncogenes, and no aberrant clonal expansion was
observed after 20 to 32 months. Although extended clinical observation is required to establish
long-term safety, lentiviral gene therapy represents a promising treatment for WAS.

thrombocytopenia, eczema, autoimmunity, and
lymphoid malignancies (1, 2). The disorder is
caused by mutations in the WAS gene, which
codes for WASP, a protein that regulates the
cytoskeleton. WASP-defective immune cells dis-
play alterations in proliferative responses after
activation, cell migration, immunological synap-
sis formation, and cytotoxicity (3–5). Allogeneic
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) trans-
plantation can be curative, but it is often asso-
ciated with substantial morbidity and mortality,
particularly in the absence of fully matched donors
(6–8).

For patients without matched donors, an al-
ternative therapeutic strategy is the infusion of
autologous HSPCs that have been genetically
corrected ex vivo. This gene therapy approach has
been successful in more than 50 patients affected
by primary immunodeficiencies, including 10 WAS
patients treated with HSPCs transduced with a
g-retroviral vector encoding a functional WAS
gene (9–15). Gene therapy combined with a re-
duced intensity conditioning regimen proved to
be effective and safe in patients with severe com-
bined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine
deaminase (ADA) deficiency, who were followed
up to 13 years after treatment (9, 15, 16). In contrast,
despite the initial clinical benefit, gene therapy
with g-retroviral–transduced HSPC was associated
with the development of leukemia or myelodysplasia
in patients with SCID-X1, chronic granulomatosis

disease, and WAS (14, 17–20). These adverse
events were ascribed to vector insertion sites (ISs)
near specific proto-oncogenes, leading to their trans-
activation by enhancer/promoter sequences with-
in the long-terminal repeat (LTR) of the retroviral
vector (10–12, 21–23). In the case of WAS, char-
acterization of ISs over the first 2 years of follow-
up revealed a highly skewed insertion profile in
vivo, resulting in the expansion of clones with
insertions in proto-oncogenes such as LMO2 (12),
some of which progressed to leukemias (14, 24).
The possibility of vector-driven leukemogenesis
is a particular concern for WAS patients, who are
cancer-prone (1).

Lentiviral vectors with self-inactivating (SIN)
LTRs integrate efficiently in HSPC, allow robust
transgene expression from a promoter of choice
inserted within the vector, and could potentially
be safer for gene therapy applications (24–26).
Lentiviral-based HSPC gene therapy combined
with full conditioning has been used to treat three
patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) (27)
and one patient with b-thalassemia (28), resulting
in 10 to 15% progenitor cell marking with ther-
apeutic benefit. Although a relative expansion of
a clone harboring an insertion in the HMGA2
gene was observed in the b-thalassemia patient
(28), no aberrant clonal proliferation has been re-
ported for the lentiviral-based trials up to 5 years
after treatment (27, 29).

We developed a SIN lentiviral vector coding
for human WASP under the control of a 1.6-kb
reconstituted WAS gene promoter (LV-w1.6W)
(3). The use of this endogenous promoter ensures
that the transgene is expressed in a physiological
manner (4), restoring WASP expression and func-
tion in human and murine WAS cells (3, 30–34).
Its moderate enhancer activity combined with the
SIN LTR design reduces the risk of insertional
mutagenesis (35 ), as shown by in vitro transfor-
mation assays (36) and preclinical in vivo studies
in WASP-deficient mice (34, 37). These data pro-
vided the rationale for a phase I/II clinical trial in
which LV-w1.6W was used as a gene therapy
vector for treatment of patients with WAS (38).

Results

Lentiviral Transduction of HSPC and Infusion of
Gene-Corrected Cells into Patients Pretreated
with Reduced Intensity Conditioning
Three children with WAS, who had been shown
by genotyping to carry severe mutations in the
X-linked WAS gene and who did not have com-
patible allogeneic donors, were enrolled in the
phase I/II clinical trial (Table 1). All patients suf-
fered from recurrent infections, eczema, bleeding,
and thrombocytopenia, with a disease score ranging
from 3 to 4 (39) (Table 1). Autologous bone-marrow
(BM)–derived CD34+ cells were collected, trans-
duced twice with purified LV-w1.6W vector using
an optimized protocol (fig. S1) (34), and reinfused
intravenously back into the patients 3 days after
collection. The vector and genetically modified

cells were characterized extensively for quality
and safety (tables S1 to S3 and figs. S1 and S2).
Vector-specific quantitative real-time fluores-
cence polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on indi-
vidually collected colony-forming cells (CFC)
revealed high gene transfer efficiency—i.e., 88 to
100%. Average vector copy number (VCN) per
genome measured in bulk-cultured CD34+ cells
was 2.3 T 0.6 (Table 1). WASP expression in the
transduced CD34+ cells was confirmed by immu-
noblotting (fig. S3). Before HSPC reinfusion, pa-
tients received a reduced-intensity conditioning
regimen, consisting of monoclonal antibody (mAb)
to CD20 , busulfan [7.6 to 10.1 mg/Kg intravenous
(i.v.), targeted for weight and pharmacokinetics],
and fludarabine (60 mg/m2), designed to achieve
considerable depletion of endogenous HSPC and
immune cells with limited toxicity (see Materials
and Methods). The mean infused CD34+ cell
dose was 11.07 T 2.70 × 106 cells/kg (Table 1 and
table S4). No adverse reactions were observed
after the infusions.

Engraftment of Lentiviral-Transduced Cells
and Restoration of WASP Expression
All three WAS patients showed robust and multi-
lineage engraftment of gene-corrected cells in
BM and peripheral blood (PB), persisting up to
the latest time point analyzed (30 months after
gene therapy). Gene-marking in PB granulocytes
peaked in the first month after treatment and then
stabilized at a VCN range of 0.4 to 0.9 (Fig. 1A).
Similar marking levels were seen in PB mono-
cytes (Fig. 1A), as well as in granulocytic and
megakaryocytic cells, CD34+ cells (Fig. 1B),
and erythroid cells (fig. S4) collected from
the BM. The in vivo engraftment of lentiviral-
transduced HSPC was confirmed throughout
the follow-up and persisted at high levels [pa-
tient 1 (Pt1), 34%; Pt2, 26%; Pt3, 48%) 1 year
after treatment, as shown by vector-specific PCR
on BM CFC (Fig. 1C). Based on these data, we
estimated that each transduced progenitor cell
contained on average 1 to 1.6 copies of the vec-
tor. Transduced B and natural killer (NK) cells
were detectable 1 month after gene therapy and
increased over time, with PB-derived B cells
showing VCN higher by a factor of 1.5 to 2 as
compared with BM B cells (Fig. 1, A and B).
Transduced T cells appeared 3 to 6 months after
gene therapy and reached the highest VCN as
compared with other lineages (VCN range 1.0
to 2.4) (Fig. 1A).

WASP expression, as measured by flow cytom-
etry, progressively increased over time in PB lym-
phocytes and platelets in all three patients (Fig.
1D). WAS protein was present in a large propor-
tion of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), NK cells, and
monocytes at mean expression level comparable
to normal donors, whereas in B cells and platelets
its expression level was lower than in controls
(fig. S5). Interestingly, the proportion of WASP+
cells was higher in PB-derived platelets as com-
pared with their BM-derived counterparts (fig.
S6), suggesting a preferential migration or selec-

tive survival advantage of gene-corrected plate-
lets in the periphery.

Clinical and Immunological Improvement
After Gene Therapy
All treated children are clinically well with post-
treatment follow-up of 20 to 32 months (Table 1).
After conditioning, patients experienced severe
neutropenia (neutrophil counts <500/ml) lasting
from 12 to 19 days, followed by normalization of
neutrophil counts. None of the patients experienced
mucositis or other chemotherapy-related toxicity.
Serious adverse events occurred in Pt2 and Pt3
within the first 2 to 6 months of gene therapy. These
events were mainly of infectious origin, likely fa-
vored by the underlying clinical conditions and
immune deficiency typical of the early posttrans-
plant period. Both patients fully recovered from
them (see Materials and Methods). No abnormal
cellular expansion was detected in BM and PB by
immunophenotypic, morphologic, and karyotypic
analyses. Assays to detect antibodies to HIV Gag
p24 and replication-competent lentivirus in patients’
blood were negative at all times of analysis.

In all three children, symptoms of WAS showed
substantial improvement. Pretreatment eczema re-
solved between 6 and 12 months after gene therapy

and did not recur (Table 1). Beginning 6 months
after gene therapy, the frequency and severity of
infections progressively decreased, and cytomegalo-
virus replication was well-controlled, allowing
withdrawal of anti-infectious prophylaxis in Pt1
and Pt3. Pt1 discontinued i.v. immunoglobulin sup-
plementation 6 months after gene therapy, with
positive antibody responses after vaccination.

Platelet counts improved significantly during
the first year after gene therapy (Fig. 2A), as
assessed by a mixed linear model applied to the
serially repeated sampling (P = 0.03). Although
these counts never reached normal values, the
platelet volumes normalized after gene therapy
(mean platelet volume range, 8.3 to 9.2 fl; normal
values, 7.4 to 10.9 fl). After discontinuation of
platelet transfusions (1 to 7 months after gene
therapy), none of the patients experienced bleed-
ing or skin manifestations of thrombocytopenia,
with the exception of occasional grade 1 gastro-
intestinal bleeding in Pt2 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, all
patients tested negative for a large panel of auto-
antibodies 1 year after gene therapy. The overall
clinical improvement resulted in a reduced dis-
ease severity score in all patients (Fig. 2C).

Lymphocyte subpopulation counts decreased
after the conditioning regimen but progressively

returned to normal levels for age within 6 to
12 months after treatment (fig. S7). In all patients,
proliferative responses to mAb to CD3 increased
after treatment and reached the range of age-
matched controls (Fig. 2D). Similarly, the prolif-
erative capacity of T cell lines from Pt1 and Pt3
greatly improved after gene therapy (fig. S8). T
cell receptor (TCR) Vb profiling revealed that all
three WAS patients displayed a broader polyclo-
nal repertoire after gene therapy, in agreement
with the polyclonal reconstitution observed by IS
analysis (see below) (fig. S9).

Because regulatory T (Treg) cell function is
defective in WAS patients (32, 40), we evaluated
the suppressive ability of Treg cells (VCN, 1.37)
sorted from Pt1. As shown in Fig. 2E, the in vitro
suppressive function of Treg cells was restored
after gene therapy. This is consistent with the
finding that CD4+/CD25high cells from both Pt1
and Pt3 express WASP after gene therapy (fig.

S10). It is known that WASP-deficient NK cells
show an altered immune function (41). We found
that WASP-expressing, but not WASP-deficient,
NK cells isolated from Pt1 after gene therapy func-
tioned normally in immunological synapse forma-
tion (Fig. 2F and fig. S11). The improved NK cell
function of all three patients resulted in normal
cytotoxic activity after gene therapy (Fig. 2G).

Multilineage and Polyclonal Engraftment of
Gene-Corrected HSPC, Assessed by Longitudinal
Integration Site Profiling
To monitor the clonal contribution of gene-
corrected cells to hematopoiesis in the three
patients, we performed a high-throughput IS analy-
sis (42, 43) on multiple lineages and time points
up to 18 months after infusion of transduced
HSPCs (see Supplementary Text, figs. S12 to S46,
and tables S8 to S25). Linear amplification-
mediated (LAM) PCR and next-generation sequenc-

ing (42, 43) detected >2,400,000 IS sequences
that were mapped to 33,363 unique chromosomal
positions in the patients: 11,137 from Pt1, 10,889
from Pt2, and 10,337 from Pt3.

The relative proportion of sequencing reads
corresponding to each specific IS, as collected
from BM CD34+ cells and PB myeloid B and
T cells, was used as a surrogate of clonal rep-
ertoire of gene-corrected cells and safety readout
(Fig. 3 and figs. S12 to S14). We found that, be-
ginning 1 month after gene therapy, the vast ma-
jority of ISs from all lineages and time points
were well below 5%, with a few occasionally reach-
ing up to 15 to 20% of the total reads retrieved from
a lineage (Fig. 3A). By monitoring the most fre-
quent ISs in each lineage, we found that highly
represented insertion sites were different at each
time point and fluctuated over time for up to 6
to 12 months after gene therapy (Fig. 3B). At
later time points, in line with the stabilization of

hematopoietic output, we detected a persistent
multilineage contribution of several ISs, some of
which were highly represented (Fig. 3B), but re-
mained below 10% of all the reads belonging to
ISs retrieved from the PB cells in the 1-year in-
terval (Fig. 3A and fig. S14). It is possible that HSPC
activity in Pt2 was affected by the occurrence of
bacterial sepsis 6 months after gene therapy. At
that time, a group of ISs marking T cells, B cells,
and myeloid cells became relatively more abun-
dant, possibly revealing the stress-induced activation
of a limited pool of progenitors.

The Shannon diversity index was used to assess
the overall clonal repertoire composition of in vivo–
derived BM CD34+ and myeloid cells. In the first
months after treatment, clonal diversity was lower
then measured in the in vitro–transduced cell pop-

ulation but later increased and stabilized at 12 to
18 months (Fig. 3C). As predicted by the slower
dynamics of thymic reconstitution, T cells showed
different kinetics with increasing diversity from 3 to
6 months and stabilization to levels similar to other
lineages at 9 to 18 months after gene therapy.

We next compared ISs retrieved from BM
CD34+ cells, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages in
each patient, applying stringent analytical filters
to take into account sample impurity and cross-
contaminations. This analysis unveiled a group of
ISs that was shared among these data sets (Fig. 4A).
The shared ISs in CD34+ cells and myeloid/lymphoid
lineages increased from 18.2 to 27.2% at 1 year
after gene therapy in Pt1. A higher proportion of
integrations shared with other lineages (44.1%)
was detected in BM CFC from Pt1. A substan-

tial fraction of the ISs retrieved from BM CD34+
cells or CFC at 1 year after gene therapy (Fig. 4B)
could be traced back to earlier follow-up samples
of mature cells, pointing to the efficient engraft-
ment of self-renewing gene-marked HSPCs.

Our data allowed an estimation of the number
of transduced HSPCs contributing to hematopoiesis
in vivo. Vector integrations were analyzed in two
independent samplings (12 and 18 months after
gene therapy) of purified PB myeloid cells, which
are short-lived and provide a readout of stem
cell output. Using the Petersen/Schnabel model
estimator of population size (44), we calculated a
theoretical minimal number of about 6300 and
1700 transduced active stem cells in Pt1 and Pt2,
respectively (table S25), which corresponds to
about 1.5 to 2.5 in 1 × 105 infused CD34+ cells.

“Integrome” in Gene Therapy of WAS
We compared the integration profile of LV-w1.6W
vector with 11,294 unique ISs retrieved from two
WAS patients enrolled in the g-retroviral gene

therapy trial (12) collected over a similar time
frame and analyzed through the same mapping
pipeline to obtain a comparable data set (table

vector was similar in all three patients and fit the

classical distribution of lentivirus showing a strong
tendency to integrate within transcriptional units
(fig. S15B) and cluster in gene-rich regions (Fig. 5A
and fig. S15, A and B). No major difference was
observed in the genomic distribution of LV-w1.6W

in the in vitro– versus patients-derived samples
(fig. S16A). By contrast, the profile found in the
cells from patients treated with g-retroviral gene
therapy was very different, showing a skewed
profile toward transcription start sites (fig. S15A).
As reported in previous studies (45, 46), vec-
tor integration site selection could be influenced
by the chromatin status of target cells during trans-
duction and infection. Thus, we analyzed the den-
sity distribution of histone modifications mapped
in CD34+ cells (47) on a 100-kb window sur-
rounding the ISs from the two cohorts of patients
(Fig. 5B and fig. S20). The probability density
map showed that certain histone modifications
were equally preferred (H3K4me1) or avoided

(H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) by lentivirus and
retrovirus integrations. In addition, no major dif-
ferences were observed between in vitro and
in vivo lentivirus data sets. By contrast, other chro-
matin features—such as H3K4me3, H3K36me3,
and H2AZ, marking, respectively, transcription
start sites, coding, and enhancer/promoter regions
of actively expressed genes—were present at
differential intensity around ISs of the two vec-
tors (Fig. 5B). Of note, the concomitant low den-
sity of H3K4me3 and H2AZ seems to provide
an optimal chromatin environment for lentivirus
insertions (figs. S17 to S19) and help explain
the different genomic distribution observed for
retroviruses.

We also analyzed the ontological categories
of the genes targeted by vector integration sites in
the data sets from the two patient cohorts by using
the GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of
Annotations Tool) software (48) (Fig. 5C). A broad
spectrum of biological categories, including anti-
gen presentation, response to virus, chromatin
modification, and gene silencing, was represented
among the lentivirus targeted genes. In contrast,
the retroviral insertions were more often proximal
to genes related to hematopoietic system maintenance,
as well as to hematological diseases. Of note, the
vast majority of gene categories targeted by ISs in
our LV-w1.6W patients were also targeted in the
previous ALD gene therapy trial (27) (figs. S21

and S22). Thus, differently from retroviruses,
LV-w1.6W has a lower probability to interfere
with the expression of genes involved in trans-
formation of hematopoietic cells due to its wider
genomic distribution.

We next assessed the presence of common
insertion sites (CIS) to study potential insertional

hotspots at the time of transduction and define
surrogate markers of in vivo selection of clones.
CIS were detected using a canonical statistical
method that assumes a random distribution of
vector integrations (49) and a novel analysis for
CIS discovery based on a genome-wide Grubbs
test for outliers (for details on both methods, see

supplementary text). The highest-ranking-order
WAS lentiviral CIS were KDM2A (targeted by
125 integrations), PACS1 (117) and TNRC6C (94)
(table S23), which are well known hot spots in
preclinical studies of lentiviral vectors (50, 51)
and in the ALD lentiviral gene therapy trial
(27) and have not been associated with clonal

expansion (Fig. 6A and fig. S40). In contrast,
g-retroviral vector was found clustered in vivo
in the MECOM (MDS-EVI1) and LMO2 loci (Fig.
6A), hosting 67 and 15 of 11,294 integrations,
respectively (12). In the current LV-w1.6W gene
therapy trial, these two genes were hit only by
10 and 5 out of 33,363 integrations, respectively
(Fig. 6B). Additionally, the relative sequence reads
associated to these ISs (0.44% and 0.05% of
reads from the same time point and sample source
for MECOM and LMO2, respectively) were be-
low the average of all other insertions, and these
specific integrants were not consistently detected
over time. These observations were confirmed
for insertions near other genes previously in-
volved in clonal dominance, such as CCND2
and PRDM16 (fig. S15C). The HMGA2 locus
was hit in both data sets (fig. S15C) but, in con-
trast to what was reported in the b-thalassemia pa-
tient (28), we did not observe over-representation
of these integrations during follow-up. Togeth-
er, these results indicate the lack of evident clonal
expansions associated with CIS in proximity of
known proto-oncogenes, suggesting that the
insertional hot spots found in our trial are the
product of vector integration biases at the
time of transduction rather than in vivo genetic
selection of ISs conferring a selective growth
advantage.

Discussion
We have shown that infusion of autologous HSPC
transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a
functional WASP gene resulted in robust and stable
multilineage engraftment in three WAS patients
who had been pretreated with a reduced intensity
preparative regimen. The gene-corrected blood cells
expressed WASP under control of a reconstituted
WAS promoter. The patients showed improved
immune function and amelioration of clinical man-
ifestations of the disease, including protection from
bleeding and severe infections, as well as resolu-
tion of eczema.

In this trial, the in vivo gene marking of hem-
atopoiesis was superior (~25 to 50% of BM pro-
genitors and mature PB myeloid cells) to that
described in other lentiviral-based gene therapy
trials for ALD and b-thalassemia (27, 28), which
used myeloablative preparative regimens. The use
of highly purified and homogenous batches of
lentiviral vectors, optimized culture conditions and
vector exposure (34), and the infusion of cells
shortly after transduction likely accounts for the
robust engraftment. In a parallel trial using the
same procedures to treat patients with metachro-
matic leukodystrophy (MLD) (52), in vivo gene
marking of HSPC was even higher (45 to 80%).
The preparative conditioning regimen in the
latter trial was more intensive, suggesting that
chemotherapy regimens can be modulated based
on the engraftment threshold required for ther-
apeutic benefit. Notably, stable engraftment of
marked progenitor cells in vivo was higher in
this lentiviral vector trial than in the previous
WAS trial based on g-retrovirus vector (3 to

22%) (12). A selective advantage of lymphoid
cells carrying a functional WAS gene (12) was
observed in both clinical trials, in line with pre-
vious studies in the murine disease model
(12, 30, 33, 53).

Although gene therapy did not normalize
platelet counts in the patients, the counts did in-
crease significantly and the platelets were of nor-
mal size, improvements that were sufficient to
protect patients from bleeding and related disor-
ders. Considering that the BM must contain a
mixed population of WASP-positive and WASP-
negative megakaryocytes and only platelets with
normal levels of WASP were detected in periph-
eral blood, it is conceivable that a threshold level
of WASP is required for platelets to exit the BM
and/or to survive in the periphery. It is note-
worthy that platelet counts in WAS patients treated
by lentiviral gene therapy are in the range mea-
sured in patients with mixed donor/host chimerism
after successful allogeneic BM transplant (7). A
more intense conditioning regimen or the use of
a lentiviral vector with a stronger promoter might
result in a greater number of gene-corrected
platelets. However, these options should be care-
fully balanced with the higher risk of toxicity, as
reported for the conditioning used in allogeneic
BM transplant, as well as of transactivation and
insertional oncogenesis associated with strong en-
hancers and promoters, such as those of g-retroviral
vectors (54).

A consistent multilineage recapture of ISs 12
months after gene therapy indicated the active
contribution of gene-corrected long-term HSPC
to hematopoiesis. Our results lead us to propose
that a takeover of hematopoietic output by long-
term HSPC occurs at a defined time window after
gene therapy, generating a diverse clonal rep-
ertoire in the blood progeny. The high proportion
of ISs found in clonogenic BM progenitors that
are shared with mature lineages validates IS-based
tracking of stem cell dynamics and the colony
assay as a representative surrogate readouts of
in vivo HSPC activity. The calculated minimal
number of 1700 to 6300 transduced active stem
cells engrafted in vivo is consistent with data
from the parallel MLD trial (52) and with es-
timates that repopulating HSPCs account for
1 out of 104 to 105 infused CD34+ cell populations
(55), considering the impact of cell manipula-
tion and the potentially limited BM homing after
transplant.

The study of ISs from WAS patients treated
with lentiviral or retroviral vector (12 ) allowed
the first comparative study of the safety and clin-
ical performance of two different vectors in the
context of the same disease background. Our analy-
ses expand previous observations that chromatin
conformation and histone modifications differ-
ently affect the genomic distribution of retroviral
vectors (45, 56), with the identification of H3K4me3
and H2AZ as two major chromatin determinants
of differential insertions between lentiviruses and
retroviruses. Differently from the retroviral gene
therapy trial, where clonal enrichment of ISs tar-

geting oncogenes like MECOM, CCND2, and
LMO2 had already occurred at early follow-up,
oncogenic ISs were not overrepresented in our
patients, in agreement with previous preclinical
and clinical studies (27, 34, 51). Many genes
and related categories targeted by lentivirus in
our WAS patients were also hit in the parallel
MLD trial (52) and in a previous ALD lentiviral
trial (27), where no clonal dominance or leuke-
mia have been reported up to 5 years after treat-
ment (14). These findings are particularly relevant
considering the high risk of lymphomagenesis
described in WAS patients. The overall tendency
of LV-w1.6W to distribute over megabase-wide
areas and a broader spectrum of gene classes,
together with the lower transformation potential
of our SIN LTR-based construct, likely make
lentiviral vector less prone to aberrantly interact
with proto-oncogenes and induce genotoxicity.
Collectively, although a definitive conclusion on
safety must await the long-term observations, these
data suggest that lentiviral-based HSPC gene ther-
apy is safer than retroviral gene therapy.

Materials and Methods

Clinical Protocol and Patients
A phase I/II clinical trial of HSPC gene therapy
for WAS was initiated in April 2010, after au-
thorization by Istituto Superiore di Sanità on
15 March 2010 and by San Raffaele Scientif-
ic Institute Ethics Committee on 2 April 2010
(Eudract no. 2009-017346-32). The study pro-
moter is HSR-TIGET, San Raffaele Hospital,
Italy, and the financial sponsor of the study is
Telethon Foundation. The medicinal product re-
ceived Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) (EU/3/12/998)
and the FDA (ODD#10-3043).

Male children with WAS suffering from a
severe clinical condition (Zhu clinical score ≥ 3) or
severe mutation/absent WASP expression, without
a suitable matched donor for allogeneic transplant
or ineligible for HSPC transplantation (because
of age >5 years or clinical features), were eligible
for the study. The parents of all subjects provided
written informed consent for experimental treat-
ment. Details on the clinical study can be found at
ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT01515462). Biological
samples were obtained from WAS patients, healthy
children or adults, with approval of the San Raffaele
Scientific Institute’s Ethics Committee and consent
from parents or subjects.

Lentiviral Vector
The lentiviral vector used in this clinical trial is a
third-generation SIN vector derived from HIV,
named pCCLsin.cPPT.hw1.6.hWAS.WPREmut
(abbreviated as LV-w1.6W), and it has been pre-

RESEARCH ARTICLE

In the cassette, the endogenous 1.6-kb promoter
of WAS controls the expression of WAS cDNA.
The three vector components (core, envelope, and
genome) are transiently expressed in vector
producer cells by four different constructs: two
core packaging constructs, the envelope construct,
and the transfer vector construct. Only the vector
construct is transferred and integrated into the
target cells.

Clinical lots of vectors were produced under
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions
by MolMed S.p.A. (Milan, Italy), a certified GMP
facility. Vectors were produced by large-scale pro-
cess based on transient quadritransfection in 293T
cells, followed by purification through endonu-
clease treatment, anion exchange chromatography
with gradient elution, gel filtration, resuspension
in serum free media, 0.22 mm filtration, and aseptic
filling (fig. S1). Each lot was characterized in terms
of titer, potency, purity, and safety aspects (tables
S1 and S2).

CD34+ Cell Gene Transfer
Patients’ CD34+ cell manipulation and transduc-
tion were performed at MolMed S.p.A. as detailed
in fig. S2. Patients’ BM was diluted, stratified with
Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway), and
centrifuged in order to collect mononuclear cells
(MNC). CD34+ cell-positive selection from BM
MNC was performed using immunomagnetic beads
(CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach,
Germany) and an immunomagnetic enrichment
device. For MPB leukapheresis, CD34+ cells were
processed using the CliniMACS device. Two inde-
pendent lots of transduced cells were prepared for
Pt1 (one for BM and one for MPB). The number
of CD34+ cells collected from the BM and used
for transduction ranged from 4.4 to 14.5 × 106/kg
(table S3). MPB-derived CD34+ cells in Pt1 were
6.5 × 106/kg after thawing on day 3 (table S3).
Purified CD34+ cells were seeded on VueLife bags
(American Fluoroseal Corp., Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) at 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free CellGro
SCGM Medium (Cell Genix Technologies, Freiburg,
Germany) in the presence of cell culture grade
stem cell factor (SCF) 300 ng/ml (Amgen Inc.,
Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), FLT3-L 300 ng/ml,
thrombopoietin (TPO) 100 ng/ml, and IL-3 60 ng/ml
(all from Cell Genix Technologies). After 24 hours
of prestimulation, cells were transduced with LV-
w1.6W at 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI)
for two hits of transduction with a wash period
of 12 to 14 hours between the vector exposures.
Transduced cells were tested for immune pheno-
type, sterility, endotoxin, mycoplasma, large T anti-
gen, E1A DNA, large T antigen DNA, clonogenic
content, transduction efficiency, and replication-
competent lentivirus (table S4). Cells were resus-
pended in saline and transferred in a syringe for
infusion. An aliquot of cells was cultured in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM), 10% fetal
bovine serum (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ,
USA) with the same cytokines at 20 ng/ml con-
centration and harvested after 15 days to perform
proviral integration evaluation by qPCR, WASP

expression measurement, and integration profile
analysis.

Rationale for Conditioning Regimen
Allogeneic HSPC transplant for WAS patients
usually requires a high-dose myeloablative and
immune suppressive regimen to deplete host bone
marrow stem cells and prevent rejection or graft-
versus-host disease. Previous studies in the con-
text of ADA-SCID gene therapy indicated that
a reduced-dose chemotherapy regimen with
busulfan at 25% of standard dose was sufficient
to achieve substantial engraftment of gene-corrected
cells while reducing conditioning-related toxicity
(9, 15, 16). Because WAS requires higher levels
of stem cell correction with respect to SCID, our
chemotherapy regimen is based on administra-
tion of both busulfan and fludarabine as depleting
agents for endogenous HSPC. The dose of busulfan
and fludarabine are ~50% and 30% of the ones
employed in standard allogeneic transplantation,
respectively. Fludarabine was also used to break
the homeostasis in the compartment of early lym-
phoid progenitors and to favor the establishment
of a pool of corrected naïve T cells in the periph-
ery, because the selective advantage for WASP+
cells is thought to take place mainly through pe-
ripheral expansion rather than during thymic dif-
ferentiation (57, 58). mAb to CD20 was introduced
as a depleting agent for B cells, and particularly
of autoreactive cells, thereby facilitating the en-
graftment and expansion of gene-corrected B cells
expressing WAS. In addition, antibody to CD20
was used as pre-emptive treatment for lympho-
proliferative disorder due to Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), which represents a high risk factor for the
development of lymphoma in WAS patients.

Patients’ Treatment
In Pt1, mobilization of peripheral blood stem
cells after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) stimulation was performed to collect
back-up HSPCs and store an adequate HSPC dose
for subsequent transduction and reinfusion in case
of need. In Pt2 and Pt3, due to their younger age,
only a BM back-up was performed. A central
venous catheter was implanted in all patients.

On day 3, autologous BM was collected from
iliac crests under general anesthesia. A reduced-
intensity conditioning regimen was then administered
before reinfusion of the autologous-engineered
HSPC. It consisted of i.v. busulfan [bodyweight-
based and area under the curve (AUC) adjusted-dose;
range, 0.8 to 1.2 mg/kg/dose] administered con-
secutively in eight doses every 6 hours from days –3
to day –1 and i.v. fludarabine (30 mg/sqm/day)
on days –3 and –2. The actual doses and AUC of
busulfan received by each patient are summa-
rized in table S5. A single dose of mAb to CD20
(Rituximab, 375 mg/sqm) was administered on
day –22. Transduced autologous LV-w1.6W
CD34+ cells, manufactured as indicated above,
were infused i.v. in 20 min. Patients received anti-
bacterial, antifungal, anti–Pneumocistis jirovecii,
and antiviral prophylaxes according to local stan-

dards. The treatment was administered at the
Pediatric Immunology and BM Transplantation
Unit, and patients were hospitalized in isolation
for 40, 70, and 43 days, respectively.

Patients’ Features and Clinical Course After
Gene Therapy.
The clinical features before treatment and the
current clinical conditions of the first three pa-
tients treated are summarized in Table 1. Pt1 was
a 5.7-year-old boy lacking an human lymphocyte
antigen–compatible donor, with clinical history
of recurrent, frequent ENT and viral infections,
skin petechiae, and moderate-severe eczema (Zhu
score 3). His clinical course after treatment was
uneventful. The second and third patients (Pt2
and Pt3) were younger and had a Zhu score of 4,
due to history of severe infections, severe ec-
zema, and GI bleeding. Pt2 was affected by a
colitis associated with HHV-6 and CMV infection,
as well as persistently elevated inflammatory
indexes and vasculitis-like skin manifestations.
Pt3 had important feeding problems, with severe
GE reflux and food aversion, and was fed by
nasogastric tube. Pt2 developed an autoimmune
thrombocytopenia, which is frequently observed
after allogeneic transplant and was treated with
IVIG and mAb to CD20. The patient experienced
a Gram-negative sepsis complicated by a dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which
he received steroids for about 5.5 months. Pt3’s
clinical course was characterized by respiratory
infections related to aspiration due to the under-
lying GE reflux, including an episode of intersti-
tial aspiration pneumonia, complicated by ARDS,
and requiring steroid treatment for about 2 months.
Both patients recovered well from these events
without sequelae. No immune suppressive treat-
ment was administered to the patients subsequently.
Pt1 responded to vaccination with recombinant
antigens, with production of specific antibodies
and in vitro proliferative responses to tetanus
toxoid.

Laboratory Studies

CFC Assay
CFC assay was performed, immediately after
transduction or on ex vivo BM samples accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s procedure in Methocult
medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,
Canada). At day 14, colonies were scored to de-
termine number and type of colonies, singly picked
and analyzed by qPCR to evaluate the percentage
of transduction.

Flow-Cytometric Analysis
Surface staining of transduced CD34+ cells was
performed with mAb to CD34 (8G12) and mAb
to CD45 (HI30) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Cells from PB of patients and healthy donors,
purified by standard density gradient technique
(Lymphoprep), were stained for the expression of
surface markers CD3 (SK7), CD4 (SK3), CD8

(SK1), CD19 (SJ25C1), CD14 (MFP9), CD56
(NCAM16.2), CD25 (2A3), and CD41 (HIP8)
(BD Biosciences) and of intracytoplasmatic ex-
pression of WASP. Detection of WASP was per-
formed after permeabilization (Cytofix/Cytoperm
kit, BD Biosciences) by two lots of rabbit poly-
clonal antibodies to human WASP (one of which
was a gift of H. Ochs) and followed by staining
with a secondary Alexa 488 or 647 conjugated goat
antibody to rabbit immunoglobulins (Ig) anti-rabbit
antibodies. Tertiary rabbit antibodies to goat Ig
(conjugated to Alexa 488 or 647) (all from Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used. For analyses of TCR
repertoire, 24 different TCR Vb specificities were
analyzed by flow cytometric analysis by I0Test
Beta Mark kit (Immunotech, Marseilles, France)
according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Cells
were acquired using a FACSCantoII (BD Biosci-
ences) and analyzed with Flow Jo Software (Tree
Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Western Blot Analysis
Western blot was performed as previously described
(3, 34), using antibody to human WASP (H250;
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, California,
USA) and antibody to human glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon, Temecula,
California, USA), followed by secondary horse-
radish peroxidase–coupled antibodies (DAKO
A/S, Glostrup, Denmark).

Purification of Peripheral Blood
and Bone Marrow Lineages
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD15, CD19, and CD56
cells were purified from MNC from PB. CD3,
CD15, CD19, CD34, CD56, CD61, and glyco-
phorin were purified from BM-derived MNCs by
positive selection with immunomagnetic beads ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s procedure (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany).

Determination of Vector Copy Number by
Real-Time PCR
To evaluate the number of lentiviral vector copies
integrated per genome, a qPCR was performed
using specific primer and probes for human telo-
merase and lentiviral vector, as described previ-
ously (34). A reference standard was obtained
from serially diluted transduced human T cell
lines carrying one copy of integrated lentiviral
vector. Results of integrated vector copies were
normalized for the number of evaluated genomes.
As a negative control, samples of untransduced
cells were used. All the reactions were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
analyzed with an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence de-
tection system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA).

Vector Integration Analyses and Bioinformatics
These methods are described extensively in the
Supplementary Materials.

In vitro Suppression Assays
Suppression assays were performed as previously de-
scribed (59). Briefly, CD4+CD25highCD127-/low Treg

cells and CD4+CD25− effector T cells were iso-
lated from MNC by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting. Cells from healthy subjects were used as
control. A total of 15 × 103 CD4+CD25− effector
T cells were stimulated by CD3-depleted antigen-
presenting cells and 1 mg/ml of soluble mAbs to
CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3, Janssen-Cilag). Suppres-
sive activity of nTreg cells was assessed by co-
culture of effector T cells with nTreg cells at a 1:1
ratio. Proliferation was evaluated by 16 hours
liquid scintillation counting of 3H-thymidine
(Amersham Biosciences) incorporation after 96 hours
of stimulation.

Analysis of the NK Cell Immunological Synapse
NK cell immunological synapses were analyzed
as previously described (60). In brief, NK cells
were cocultured with K562 target cells for 30 min
to permit the formation of conjugates. F-actin and
WASP accumulation, as well as perforin and
MTOC polarization were measured to determine
synapse maturity. The distance of the MTOC from
the synapse was measured using the Velocity soft-
ware package (Improvision-Perkin Elmer, Lexington,
MA). Mean distances of the MTOC to the im-
munological synapse are a measure of synapse
maturity and were compared by using the Mann-
Whitney rank sum test.

Chromium-Release Cytotoxicity Assay
The ability of NK cells to lyse major histocompat-
ibility complex devoid target cells was performed
using a standard chromium-release cytotoxicity as-
say (61). Briefly, K562 target cells were labeled
with 60 mCi of Na2(51CrO4) (Perkin Elmer Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA) per 106 cells for 2 hours at
37°C and resuspended at used concentration. Ef-
fectors MNC were isolated and coincubated at
serial diluted effectors to target (E:T) ratios of
60:1, 30:1, 15:1, 7.5:1, and 3.75:1 in duplicates in
a 96-well v-bottom plate (Corning Costar, NY,
USA) for 4 hours at 37°C in the atmosphere of
5% CO2. Radioactivity was measured in the cul-
ture supernatants by Canberra Packard Cobra
II Auto Gamma Counter (Canberra Packard,
Canberra, Canada). Percentage of specific target cell
lysis was calculated as follows: (experimental.cpm-
spontaneous.cpm)/(maximal.cpm-spontaneous.
cpm) × 100. For spontaneous release, targets were
cultured with medium alone, and for maximum
release in 3% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) in phosphate-buffered saline.

T Cell Response to Antibody to CD3
T cell response to antibody to CD3 was per-
formed as previously described (62). Briefly,
0.1 × 106 PB MNC were seeded into a round-
bottom 96-well plate in IMDM medium containing
5% human AB serum (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland)
in the presence of coated 1 or 10 mg/ml of antibody
to CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3, Janssen-Cilag). Prolif-
eration was assessed by 3H-thymidine (Amersham
Biosciences) incorporation after 72 or 96 hours of
stimulation. Data were expressed as the maximal
counts per minute (cpm) and stimulation index (SI,

calculated as cpm/background cpm). For prolifera-
tion assay on untransformed T cell lines, overnight
starved T cells were stained with 2 mM carboxy-
fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE),
and 0.1 × 106 cells were cultured in a round-bottom
96-well plate coated with different concentration
(from 0.01 to 10 mg/ml) of antibody to CD3. Pro-
liferation was assessed after 72 hours evaluating
CFSE dilution on a FACSCantoII, and data were
analyzed with Flow Jo Software.
