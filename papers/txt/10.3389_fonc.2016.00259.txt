Neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  that  results  from 
germline  mutations  of  the  NF1  gene,  creating  a  predisposition  to  low-grade  gliomas 
(LGGs; pilocytic astrocytoma) in young children. Insufficient data and resources repre-
sent major challenges to identifying the best possible drug therapies for children with 
this tumor. Herein, we summarize the currently available cell lines, genetically engineered 
mouse  models,  and  therapeutic  targets  for  these  LGGs.  Conspicuously  absent  are 
human tumor-derived cell lines or patient-derived xenograft models for NF1-LGG. New 
collaborative initiatives between patients and their families, research groups, and phar-
maceutical companies are needed to create transformative resources and broaden the 
knowledge base relevant to identifying cooperating genetic drivers and possible drug 
therapeutics for this common pediatric brain tumor.

LAY SUMMARY

Neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  predisposes  children  to  the  low-grade  glioma  (LGG),  pilocytic 
astrocytoma (PA). While these brain tumors are slow growing, the locations in which PAs arise 
make them difficult to surgically excise – often devastating to a child‘s sight or neurological function. 
Furthermore, no cell lines or xenograft models exist from which to develop new targeted therapies, 
leading to a sole reliance on transgenic models for mechanistic insights. Increased collaborations 
with affected patients and their families may hold the key to building the necessary resources to 
unravel biology and new therapies for this cancer.

iNTRODUCTiON

Low-grade gliomas account for 30% of primary pediatric central nervous system tumors, with PA 
predominating in children younger than 15 years of age (1). As a group, LGGs encompass both 
World Health Organization (WHO) grade I and II gliomas (2). Histologically, these tumors have 
low proliferative indices (<4%) with rare or absent mitotic figures and no evidence of necrosis.

Ricker et al.

While  distinguishing  between  these  two  malignancy  grades 
can be challenging in some pediatric LGGs, PAs, unlike their 
WHO II counterparts, have characteristic eosinophilic granular 
bodies  and  Rosenthal  fibers.  In  addition,  PAs  often  contain  a 
cystic  component,  especially  when  occurring  in  the  cerebel-
lum,  and  frequently  harbor  areas  of  compacted  bipolar  cells 
alternating with loose-textured multipolar cells and microcysts. 
Many PAs may also enhance, especially in their peripheral rim 
if  a  cystic  component  exists.  Enhancement  does  not  denote 
high-grade glioma (HGG) in this case. Also, intense meningeal 
enhancement may occur in the absence of a cystic component. 
Cystic components do not usually exist in optic nerve gliomas, 
but do exist often in PAs. Similar to other glial malignancies, 
these pediatric LGGs are immunopositive for expression of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Olig2. Finally, these tumors 
harbor a rich extracellular matrix with prominent infiltration of 
monocytes.

In  general,  children  with  PA  can  be  divided  into  distinct 
subgroups based on their molecular etiologies. First, the major-
ity of children with LGGs lack a genetic predisposition to brain 
cancer (sporadic PA). Pioneering genomic sequencing efforts by 
the Pfister laboratory and colleagues identified that the major-
ity  of  sporadic  PA  tumors  are  caused  by  a  somatic  genomic 
rearrangement of the KIAA1549 and BRAF genes to result in 
a  fusion  protein  containing  an  unregulated  and  active  BRAF 
kinase domain (3, 4). BRAFV600E mutations are most likely found 
in the extracerebellar and diencephalic regions (2). Subsequent 
studies revealed that this signature genomic alteration predomi-
nates in cerebellar and optic pathway PAs (5, 6). In addition to 
the KIAA1549:BRAF fusion, mutations in the fibroblast growth 
factor  receptor  1  (FGFR1)  and  neurotrophic  tyrosine  kinase 
receptor 2 (NTRK2) genes are (more) common in non-cerebellar 
PAs (7).

The second group of children with PA includes those who har-
bor a germline mutation in the Neurofibromin (NF1) tumor sup-
pressor gene and, therefore, have NF1 as the genetic etiology for 
their brain tumors. Examination of these tumors reveals somatic 
loss of the remaining NF1 allele, resulting in bi-allelic NF1 inac-
tivation (8). Laboratory-based research over the past 20 years has 
revealed several potential opportunities for targeted inhibition of 
the growth control pathways deregulated in sporadic and NF1-
associated PAs. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a protein 
that primarily functions as a negative regulator of the RAS proto-
oncogene. In this regard, loss of NF1 gene expression leads to 
increased RAS activation and hyperactivation of the downstream 
RAS effectors, including the RAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT 
(4) pathways, thereafter converging on the mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) complex (9). Similarly, the KIAA1549:BRAF 
mutation results in increased MEK activation (10), which also 
operates to control cell growth through the mTOR complex (11). 
While less is known about the downstream signaling pathways 
operative  in  FGFR1-  and  NTRK2-mutant  PAs,  these  receptor 
tyrosine kinase molecules are also known to activate RAS and 
RAS  downstream  signaling  and  regulate  growth  in  numerous 
other cancers (12–16). These insights have resulted in the execu-
tion of early-phase clinical trials of MEK and mTOR inhibitors 
(NCT02285439 and NCT01734512; http://clinicaltrials.org), yet 

it is clear that additional resources and research will be required 
in order to develop personalized and effective therapies for these 
brain tumors.

Clinically, children with cerebellar PA come to medical atten-
tion  when  they  present  with  signs  and  symptoms  that  reflect 
raised intracranial pressure, such as headaches, nausea/vomiting, 
blurred vision, and balance problems. Children with PAs involv-
ing the brainstem may exhibit reduced appetite, cranial neuropa-
thies, and drowsiness, while those with optic pathway gliomas 
(OPGs) may have reduced visual acuity or early-onset puberty 
when affecting the hypothalamus. For this reason, accurate age-
appropriate visual assessments are critical, especially for children 
with NF1, who are most at risk for the development of OPGs.

Therapeutically,  individuals  with  sporadic  PAs  typically 
undergo  surgical  resection  of  the  tumor,  when  feasible.  This 
approach is most often employed for those tumors located within 
the  cerebellum,  but  not  for  midline  or  optic  pathway  tumors. 
In  these  situations,  chemotherapy  (carboplatin/vincristine)  is 
employed to halt further tumor growth. However, allergic reac-
tions have been reported from 2 to 30% of children with LGG 
(17). Risk of an allergic reaction from carboplatin and increased 
peripheral  neuropathy  from  vincristine  has  led  to  vincristine 
being the first- or second-line monotherapy of choice (18–20). 
Since NF1-associated PAs are most commonly located in the optic 
pathway (optic nerve, chiasm, tracts, and radiations, Figure 1),

surgery is rarely performed, and most children with symptomatic 
tumors are treated with chemotherapy in the absence of a tissue 
diagnosis unless patients demonstrate atypical symptoms and a 
biopsy  is  deemed  unnecessary.  Alkylator-based  chemotherapy 
is typically avoided due to the risk of treatment-induced malig-
nancy.  Importantly,  radiation  therapy  is  rarely  ever  used  due 
to  the  elevated  risk  of  radiation-induced  vasculopathy  (21). 
With carboplatin/vincristine combination therapy, 56% (44/78) 
children with LGG exhibit an objective response, with two-year 
progression-free survival rates approaching 80% (22). In another 
study examining the combination of vincristine and carboplatin, 
52%  (12/23)  of  children  with  recurrent  LGG  had  an  objective 
response, and seven of these children showed tumor reductions 
greater than 50% (23). Although outcomes are far from optimal, 
approximately one-third of patients who have received chemo-
therapy demonstrated improvement of vision (almost all being 
carboplatin-based  within  the  study).  These  responses  speak  to 
the pressing need to develop targeted therapeutic agents for these 
tumors that inhibit the specific growth pathways deregulated in 
NF1-associated tumors.

A  total  of  15–20%  of  children  with  NF1  develop  LGGs 
(24–26),  affecting  1:2,500  individuals  worldwide.  Over  two-
thirds  of  these  PAs  arise  in  the  optic  pathway  (optic  nerves, 
chiasm, tracts, and radiations), with another 15% located in the 
brainstem (27). Although rare, NF1 is one of the most common 
genetic  disorders  in  humans,  and  PAs,  when  included  in  the 
LGG  category,  are  the  most  common  pediatric  brain  tumors. 
Thus, developing therapies for NF1-associated PAs could have a 
major impact on LGGs.

CURReNT eNABLiNG ReSOURCeS

Patient Registries and Biobanks
Patient  registries  provide  important  information  regarding 
demographic  and  clinical  characteristics.  Currently,  there  are 
several registries for brain tumors and others, specifically for 
NF1. Dr. Michael Fisher at the Children‘s Hospital of Philadelphia 
leads a large international study group for NF1-OPG aimed at 
defining the natural history and outcomes for these tumors. In 
2012, the Children‘s Tumor Foundation (CTF) created the NF 
Registry.  The  NF  Registry  is  a  tissue  repository  managed  by 
Precision Bioservices and curated by Patients Crossroads Inc. 
The NF registry notifies patients of new clinical trials and pos-
sible treatments, allows patients to compare medical histories, 
and  enables  patients  to  connect  with  researchers  on  pressing 
issues.

Additionally,  the  Washington  University  Neurofibromatosis 
(NF)  Center  created  (May  2011)  and  currently  hosts  the 
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Patient Registry Initiative (28). 
This epidemiologic database serves a different purpose than the 
CTF  Registry.  It  was  specifically  designed  to  facilitate  clinical 
association studies that can be mechanistically explored in the 
laboratory. As such, this registry has been invaluable for assessing 
how  internet-based  epidemiological  research  can  be  optimally 
conducted  (29,  30)  and  for  identifying  unanticipated  associa-
tions between specific clinical features for future risk assessment 
analysis (31–33).

Although not specific to NF1, the National Cancer Data Base 
is a program established by the American College of Surgeons 
in  collaboration  with  the  American  Cancer  Society  to  provide 
oncology results from Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited 
hospital registries. In addition, the Central Brain Tumor Registry 
of the United States provides an invaluable resource for descrip-
tive  statistical  data  on  all  primary  tumors,  while  the  Swedish 
Cancer  Registry  houses  similar  data  on  LGG  and  HGG  (34). 
Several other cancer registries, which track LGGs from around 
the world, are summarized in Table 1.

Finally,  a  number  of  institutions  and  laboratories,  in  close 
collaboration with neurosurgical teams, are pioneering the crea-
tion of LGG tumor banks. For example, the Pediatric Low-Grade 
Astrocytoma Program at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute has 
invested in a tissue banking research effort to abstract data of each 
tumor and distribute the frozen tissue to investigators. Similar 
biospecimen repositories also exist at Johns Hopkins University, 
St. Louis Children‘s Hospital/Washington University, Children‘s 
National  Medical  Center,  and  St.  Jude  Children‘s  Research 
Hospital. Nevertheless, the general lack of frozen tissue samples 
has hindered comprehensive analyses of cooperating molecular 
changes  in  NF1-associated  PA.  The  lack  of  surgical  specimens 
reflects the current practice of treating these tumors without a 
tissue diagnosis because current clinical practices exclude giving 
patients a biopsy unless they present clear abnormal clinical or 
radiological symptoms. However, by pooling these rare biopsy 
materials  from  a  large  number  of  institutions,  programs  like 
the NF1 Synodos LGG Initiative, spearheaded by the Children‘s 
Tumor Foundation, aim to perform comprehensive genetic and 
genomic sequencing of these tumors.

Cell Lines
Cell lines are typically derived from patients or animal models. 
Establishing cell lines from patient tumors would be ideal for test-
ing preclinical drugs because these lines closely resemble actual 
human tumors and may more closely mirror the response of a 
particular  patient‘s  tumor  to  treatment.  Unfortunately,  despite 
efforts  by  many  research  groups,  human  NF1-PA  cell  cultures 
have yet to be successfully established. It is not clear whether this 
reflects  issues  with  cellular  senescence  or  the  need  for  trophic 
growth  factors  from  the  normal  microenvironment.  As  such, 
continual passage of sporadic tumors is associated with loss of 
the  signature  fusion  BRAF  alteration  (KIAA1549:BRAF)  and 
oncogene-induced senescence (35). To date, only a small num-
ber of PA cell lines and their genetic characteristics have been 
reported, which are summarized in Table 2, including NCH492 
(BRAF duplication (4)), IPNT-H (36), and Res186 (PTEN dele-
tion and TP73 promoter hypermethylation (37, 38)). However, 
none of the LGG cell lines have reported NF1 gene loss/mutation. 
Further characterization of the existing sporadic LGG cell lines as 
well as the development of NF1-LGG cell lines are needed.

At  the  Washington  University  NF  Center,  investigators 
launched the NF1 Brain Trust Project in October 2012 to create 
a repository of NF1 patient-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) 
lines. While these are not glioma cells, they provide a renewable 
source  of  human  cells  for  cellular  reprograming.  Importantly, 
these  iPSC  lines  were  instrumental  in  demonstrating  that

different germline NF1 gene mutations result in different levels 
of neurofibromin expression (39). Current work is underway to 
use these lines as cellular substrates for glioma modeling, as part 
of the CTF NF1 Synodos Initiative.

Genetically engineered Mouse Models
In the absence of patient-derived cell lines or xenografts, geneti-
cally engineered mice (GEM), listed in Table 3, have emerged 
as instructive models for elucidating the cellular and molecular 
determinants  critical  for  glioma  formation  and  growth.  While 
mice with a germline Nf1 gene mutation (Nf1+/− mice) do not 
develop gliomas, neither do mice in which both copies of the Nf1 
gene  are  inactivated  in  neuroglial  progenitors  (40),  suggesting 
that bi-allelic Nf1 gene inactivation in the proper cell of origin is 
not sufficient for glioma formation. To better model NF1-PA aris-
ing in children with a germline NF1 gene mutation, Nf1+/− mice 
were generated in which somatic loss of the remaining functional 
Nf1 allele occurs in neuroglial progenitors (40–42). Analysis of 
the  resulting  mice  revealed  that  gliomas  arise  between  10  and 

12 weeks of age in the prechiasmatic optic nerves and chiasm 
with >90% penetrance. While these LGGs lack the characteristic 
eosinophilic  granule  bodies  and  Rosenthal  fibers  commonly 
found in NF1-PA, the murine optic glioma tumors share several 
similarities with their human counterparts. These tumors display 
frank tissue distortion evident on MRI, low proliferative indices, 
increased  microglia  infiltration,  and  axonal  damage,  which 
culminate in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and reduced visual 
acuity (40, 43–45).

Recent  studies  have  also  discovered  co-existing  genetic 
changes in NF1-PA in addition to NF1 gene mutation, including 
heterozygous PTEN deletion and KIAA1549:BRAF duplication 
(46). Based on these observations, two Nf1 optic glioma GEM 
models  were  generated  that  additionally  harbored  either  a 
heterozygous  Pten  deletion  or  KIAA1549:BRAF  overexpres-
sion.  While  KIAA1549:BRAF  overexpression  did  not  provide 
an  additional  growth  advantage,  tumors  from  mice  with  a 
co-existing  heterozygous  Pten  deletion  had  larger  volumes, 
increased proliferation indices, and more microglia infiltration.

Furthermore,  inhibition  of  Nf1+/−  non-neoplastic  stromal 
cells  (microglia)  significantly  decreases  optic  glioma  growth 
and maintenance (47). These preclinical mouse models suggest 
that additional genetic changes in NF1-associated PA patients 
differentially influence tumor growth relevant to the design of 
future therapeutic strategies.

Xenografts and Cancer Stem Cells
Whereas  xenografts  of  human  tumors  maintained  in  immu-
nocompromised mice have been regularly employed to predict 
the efficacy of candidate drugs, most of these xenografts derive 
from  high-grade  (malignant)  cancers.  In  contrast,  generating 
neoplastic  cells  from  PA  tumors  has  been  challenging  due  to 
their low clonogenic nature and the requirement for a permissive 
tumor microenvironment. As presented in Table 4, only a few 
patient-derived  xenograft  (PDX)  models  of  sporadic  PA  have 
been reported. Two such models, BT-35 and BT-40, have been 
used in a preclinical study of the selumetinib MEK inhibitor (48). 
BT-35  and  BT-40  express  WT  and  mutant  BRAF  (BRAFV600E; 
constitutively active BRAF), respectively. While BT-35 xenografts 
continued to grow in the presence of selumetinib, BT-40 xeno-
grafts are highly sensitive to MEK inhibition. To date, no PDX 
models exist for NF1-PA.

To develop robust human HGG PDX models, several groups 
have  derived  cancer  stem  cells  (CSCs)  as  in  vitro  and  trans-
plantable  in  vivo  platforms  for  drug  discovery  and  evaluation 
(49–51). Similar to their non-neoplastic counterparts, CSCs are 
capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation (52–54). 
Unfortunately,  the  CSCs  generated  from  PA  tumors  have  clo-
nogenic  frequencies  between  0.3  and  1.5%  and  often  undergo 

oncogene-induced senescence (55). As such, no PA CSC models 
have been developed from human specimens.

Using  GEM,  the  process  of  establishing  and  maintaining 
human NF1-PA CSC xenografts can be optimized. Using Nf1 
optic  glioma  GEM  models,  LGG  CSCs  have  been  isolated, 
which  were  capable  of  self-renewal,  long-term  passage,  and 
multilineage  differentiation  (56).  Importantly,  these  CSCs 
formed LGG-like lesions when injected into the brainstems of 
immunocompetent, but not immunocompromised (athymic), 
mice.  This  latter  finding  underscores  the  obligate  role  of  the 
tumor microenvironment in Nf1 murine low-grade gliomagen-
esis.  Further  work  using  these  CSCs  may  reveal  the  critical 
components  of  the  tumor  microenvironment  required  for 
CSC engraftment, which might be accurately recapitulated in 
rodents  to  enable  xenografting  of  human  NF1-PA  tumors  in 
the future.

POTeNTiAL DRUG TARGeTS

Molecular Signaling Pathways
Neurofibromin  functions  primarily  as  a  suppressor  of  RAS 
and  its  downstream  signaling  pathways  (Figure  2)  (57–62). 
Neurofibromin  contains  a  GAP  (GTPase-activating  protein)-
related domain (GRD) that accelerates the GTP hydrolysis of RAS, 
leading to RAS inactivation (63). PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK 
are two common pathways downstream of RAS. Hyperactivation 
of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways are observed in Nf1-
deficient neural stem cells (NSCs) (64) and astrocytes (65). While 
each RAS effector pathway has different functions in NSCs rela-
tive to proliferation and glial differentiation, both the PI3K/AKT

FiGURe 2 | Neurofibromin is a negative regulator of RAS and its downstream effectors. Neurofibromin protein (2818 amino acids) contains a GAP-related 
domain (GRD) domain, which functions to inhibit RAS activity through accelerating RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP hydrolysis. The RAS downstream effector pathways are 
shown, including RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR. Activation of these pathways increases cell growth and/or cell survival in Nf1-deficient neoplastic cells.

FiGURe 3 | Tumor microenvironment stimulates the growth of NF1-associated PA. Interactions between neoplastic cells (glioma cells and cancer stem cells) 
and non-neoplastic (stromal) cells are depicted. Stromal cells within the tumor environment include neurons, microglia, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Arrows 
indicate the paracrine factors (e.g., chemokines and growth factors) secreted by each cell type and their responsive cells.

and MEK/ERK pathways are hyperactivated in Nf1−/− astrocytes 
relative to their wild-type counterparts (62, 66–69). Importantly, 
these downstream effectors converge on the mTOR complex to 
regulate astrocyte growth in vitro and Nf1 optic glioma prolifera-
tion in vivo (9). Future laboratory investigations will be required 
to define the RAS effector signaling networks required for optic 
glioma  maintenance  relevant  to  adaptive  and  potential  escape 
mechanisms from targeted therapies that might be operative in 
these tumors (56).

Tumor Microenvironment
Evidence from several different experimental studies has revealed 
a critical role for the tumor microenvironment in murine Nf1 optic 
glioma formation and growth. Similar to other LGG systems, the 
tumor microenvironment of Nf1 optic glioma consists of neoplas-
tic cells (glioma cells and CSCs) and non-neoplastic stromal cells 
(neurons, endothelial cells, and monocytes) (Figure 3). Increasing 
evidence suggests that neoplastic cells secrete paracrine factors 
(e.g., chemokines) to recruit stromal cells and stimulate growth

factor/cytokine production from these cells. The growth factors 
then interact with their cognate receptors on the cell surface of 
neoplastic cells to increase cell proliferation. The roles and inter-
actions of these cells within the microenvironment of NF1-PA 
remain to be completely elucidated. To date, the importance of 
microglia to PA pathogenesis is underscored by the finding that 
35–50% of the cells in these low-grade tumors are Iba1+ tissue 
macrophages (monocytes) (70). Monocytes in the brain can rep-
resent either resident tissue macrophages (microglia) that enter 
the  brain  during  mid-embryonic  development  or  peripheral 
macrophages from the bone marrow (71). In mouse Nf1 optic 
gliomas, the monocytes are Cd11b+, Cd45low, Cx3cr1+ microglia 
(70).  These  microglia  are  critical  for  gliomagenesis,  such  that 
impairing their directional migration into the tumor by genetic 
reduction of the Cx3cl1 receptor (Cx3cr1) delays optic glioma 
formation (72). Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of microglia 
function  with  minocycline  (73)  or  c-Jun-NH2-kinase  (JNK) 
inhibitors  (74)  reduces  optic  glioma  proliferation.  In  addition, 
genetic elimination of microglia using transgenic mice expressing 
the CD11b-thymidine kinase (TK) transgene results in dramatic 
reduction in optic glioma proliferation (70). Collectively, these 
observations establish that microglia in the tumor microenviron-
ment produce critical growth factors that increase optic glioma 
growth.

To  identify  potential  growth  factors  elaborated  by  glioma-
associated microglia, RNA-sequencing of murine optic glioma-
associated  microglia  has  revealed  that  the  Ccl5  chemokine 
produced by tumor-associated microglia is a potent stromal fac-
tor important for optic glioma maintenance in mice (47). In this 
regard,  Ccl5  was  sufficient  to  increase  Nf1-deficient  astrocytes 
growth in vitro, and its inhibition using neutralizing antibodies 
reduced optic glioma proliferation in vivo. Current studies are 
underway to identify additional chemokines and growth factors 
for potential stroma-directed glioma therapies.

visual Outcome
While  15–20%  of  NF1  patients  develop  OPGs,  30–50%  will 
experience  impaired  visual  acuity.  Since  surgery  is  rarely 
employed  and  radiation  is  associated  with  the  development  of 
secondary malignancy (75, 76), the standard of care entails the 
use of chemotherapy. One of the applications of mouse Nf1 optic 
glioma models is to define the mechanisms underlying tumor-
associated visual decline. As such, Nf1 optic glioma mice develop 
a  time-dependent  sequence  of  events,  beginning  with  axonal 
injury at the tumor site, followed by axonal degeneration, RGC 
loss (apoptosis), retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and reduced 
visual acuity (44, 77).

Neurofibromin  plays  critical  roles  in  protecting  neurons 
from degeneration and cell death. As such, RGCs harboring a 
germline Nf1 gene mutation (Nf1+/−) have smaller growth cone 
areas, shorter neurite lengths, and increased cell death compared 
to wild-type RGCs (78). These abnormal cellular phenotypes are 
due to impaired neurofibromin regulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
generation. In these neurons, reduced neurofibromin expression 
results  in  lower  cAMP  levels,  such  that  elevating  cAMP  levels 
using pharmacological methods increases the growth cone areas 
and neurite lengths of Nf1+/− RGCs in vitro. In addition, elevating 

cAMP levels greatly attenuates RGC cell death in Nf1 optic glioma 
mice in vivo (78). These observations raise the potential of future 
neuroprotective strategies aimed at reducing RGC death.

Current Pediatric NF1-LGG Clinical Trials
With  respect  to  NF1-LGG,  selumetinib,  a  MEK  inhibitor  that 
inhibits  the  growth  of  a  BRAFV600E-expressing  PA  xenograft 
(48)  and  blocks  growth  in  both  Nf1  optic  glioma  (9)  and 
KIAA1549:BRAF-driven  NSC  glioma  (11)  models,  has  been 
evaluated  in  a  phase  I  clinical  trial  (http://clinicaltrials.org 
#NCT01089101)  for  pediatric  LGG.  Since  the  PI3K/AKT  and 
MEK/ERK pathways converge on mTOR, treatments that target 
mTOR may still have utility. Several mTOR inhibitors other than 
sirolimus have been investigated for treating NF1- and sporadic 
LGG.  Everolimus  (RAD001),  a  rapamycin  analog  that  targets 
mTOR, is currently being explored as a potential treatment in 
two separate trials (http://clinicaltrials.org #NCT01158651 and 
#NCT01734512, recruiting).

FUTURe MODeLS AND DeveLOPiNG 
New THeRAPeUTiC DRUGS

increase Biobanking and Database efforts
Especially  relevant  to  NF1-LGG,  proper  communication  and 
collaboration among patient families, clinicians, and research-
ers are highly recommended in order to preserve valuable LGG 
specimens  for  molecular  characterization.  The  importance 
of  donating  tumor  samples  for  research  purposes  should  be 
emphasized  to  medical  groups  and  families  –  especially  for 
patients affected by NF1-PA, for which surgical biopsy samples 
are sometimes sparingly small. Legacy gifts of autopsy tumor tis-
sue and selfless donation can similarly propel the field forward, 
while  simultaneously  providing  hope  for  families  for  whom 
treatments  are  not  currently  available.  Most  pediatric  cancer 
families  (93%)  would  agree  to  autopsies  if  given  the  option 
(79); however, there has been a decrease over the past several 
decades  in  the  acquisition  of  autopsy  specimens  for  research 
(79). Patients, advocates of patients, clinicians, and researchers 
should aim to spread awareness, enhance subject recruitment, 
and increase funding for the future storage of cryo-viable frozen 
tissue samples at one or multiple sites, with cataloging by way 
of  a  HIPAA-compliant  online  database  such  as  the  CTF  NF1 
Registry.

expand the Spectrum of Nf1 GeM Models
While Nf1 mutant mouse models provide unprecedented oppor-
tunities for drug discovery and evaluation, the current collection 
of these strains does not fully capture the full spectrum of human 
clinical heterogeneity. Laboratory investigations have begun to 
identify  the  various  factors  that  might  underlie  this  inherent 
clinical  heterogeneity.  First,  genotype–phenotype  correlation 
studies in people with NF1 have revealed intriguing associations 
(80–84); the most striking of which is the finding that individuals 
with p1809 codon mutations do not develop dermal neurofibro-
mas (85). Relevant to brain tumors, NF1 patients with 5′ NF1

gene  mutations  have  higher  chance  developing  optic  gliomas 
compared  to  patients  with  mutations  at  other  locations  of  the 
NF1  gene  (82).  Based  on  these  types  of  clinical  observations, 
human iPSCs have been used to demonstrate that different NF1 
mutations lead to different levels of neurofibromin protein loss 
(39, 86, 87). These results suggest that not all NF1 gene mutations 
are equivalent.

To explore this further, GEM have recently been engineered 
to harbor specific Nf1 mutations seen in people with NF1. This 
is in contrast to the current Nf1 optic glioma mouse model in 
which the Nf1 gene is inactivated by the insertion of a neomycin 
targeting  cassette,  a  genetic  alteration  not  seen  in  individuals 
with NF1 (88, 89). Strikingly, in these proof-of-principle studies, 
Nf1 mice harboring a representative missense mutation did not 
develop optic gliomas, whereas those with a representative non-
sense mutation harbored optic gliomas with higher proliferative 
indices than the conventional Nf1 optic glioma strain (90). Future 
preclinical studies should be designed to incorporate mice with 
different germline Nf1 gene mutations and cooperating genetic 
changes (heterozygous Pten loss; KIAA1549:BRAF expression) as 
a way of more accurately representing the full spectrum of disease 
in this patient population.

Optimize Patient-Derived Xenograft 
Methodologies
As mentioned above, the growth of LGG PDXs likely requires 
trophic  support  from  the  tumor  microenvironment.  Current 
xenograft  methodologies  developed  using  HGG  cells  may  not 
be suitable for generating LGG PDX due to the relative stromal 
independence  of  HGG  cells.  The  methodologies  for  future  PA 
PDX studies can be tested and optimized using xenografts devel-
oped from mouse NF1-LGG cells (56). Current mouse xenograft 
methodologies  involve  the  isolation  of  single  cells  (CD133+) 
from  the  optic  nerves  of  3-month-old  mice  with  NF1-LGG 
(Nf1+/−GFAPCKO  mice)  (56).  The  resulting  glioma  stem  cells 
express several stem cell markers and a response to therapeutic 

treatments similar to that observed in humans. This model lays 
the groundwork for further investigation into potential PDXs.

SUMMARY

Since the discovery of the NF1 gene in 1990, great advances have 
been made to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
underlying  NF1-PA  pathogenesis  and  maintenance.  With  the 
establishment of biobanking and registry initiatives, NF1-LGG 
specimens can be better characterized for actionable mutations. 
The  resulting  mutations  and  genomic  alterations  can  next  be 
evaluated in preclinical model systems as a means of identifying 
their contributions to tumor growth and targets for therapeutic 
intervention. Moreover, the incorporation of these cooperating 
genetic/genomic changes in combination with other factors, like 
the germline NF1 gene mutation, create a more representative 
spectrum of models that capture the innate clinical heterogeneity 
of these tumors for preclinical drug assessment and biomarker 
discovery.  The  implementation  of  these  strategies  offers  the 
greatest opportunities to discover effective treatments for these 
common  brain  tumors,  both  for  children  with  NF1  and  those 
with non-syndromic LGG.
