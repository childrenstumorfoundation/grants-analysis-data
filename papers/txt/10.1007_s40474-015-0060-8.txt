Abstract Chronic tic disorders, including Tourette’s syn-
drome (TS), are neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by
the childhood onset of motor and/or vocal tics. Youth with TS
often experience disturbances in social functioning, which can
negatively impact functioning and overall quality of life. We
summarize the existing knowledge about social deficits in
youth with TS, while highlighting the various ways that these
deficits present in comorbid developmental disorders (i.e., au-
tism spectrum disorders) as well as in other TS-related phe-
nomenology impacting social functioning (i.e., comorbid psy-
chiatric conditions, tic severity, and peer victimization). Fur-
ther, we discuss how interventions for TS should aim to ad-
dress not only tic severity, but also the multifaceted reasons for
social deficits within this population. We conclude with a
discussion of clinical implications and future directions for
clinical intervention and research.

Introduction

Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder char-
acterized by the childhood onset of multiple motor tics and at
least one vocal tic for duration of at least 1 year [1]. TS im-
pacts approximately 1–10 in 1000 children [2–4] and is com-
monly associated with other psychiatric disorders including
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [5–7],
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [6], mood disturbances
[8, 9], disruptive behaviors [10], and learning disorders [11].
In addition, youth with TS often experience peer victimization
[12, 13•], self-concept deficits [14•], and interpersonal diffi-
culties [15, 16•], particularly those with comorbid autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) [17, 18]. The compounding burden
of these co-occurring conditions is often reported as more
problematic than the tics themselves [16•, 19, 20].

Over the last few decades, researchers have increasingly
examined the prevalence, development, maintenance, and
treatment of social deficits among youth with TS. Broadly,
social deficits are considered maladaptive behaviors that can
include difficulty identifying social cues, difficulty with social
engagement (or motivation), social communication, limited
insight into other’s feelings and intentions, and/or restricted
or bizarre interests [21]. Dysfunction in these social domains
can impact a child’s ability to function in multiple settings
(home and school) and can contribute to decreases in overall
quality of life [16•]. Improving our understanding of the clin-
ical characteristics and biological underpinnings of social def-
icits in youth with TS may help inform evidenced-based in-
tervention strategies that will not only improve tic symptoms

but also address these social deficits, bolstering improved
quality of life and social acceptability of the disorder. This
paper will review the literature as it pertains to the manifesta-
tion of social deficits in children and adolescents with TS
through comorbid developmental disorders (i.e., ASD) and
through other TS-related phenomenology and/or environmen-
tal factors that impact social functioning (i.e., tic severity, peer
victimization, co-occurring psychopathology).

TS and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the
clinical characteristics and biological underpinnings of TS
and common co-occurring psychopathology, including ASD.
Although there is no enough evidence to support a unified
theory, recent research has focused on both genetic and neu-
ropathological etiologies of TS and ASD. ASDs are
neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by the presence
of impaired social interaction and communication, typically
accompanied by restricted interests and/or stereotyped behav-
iors. A recent epidemiological study estimated the global
prevalence of ASD to be between 1 and 2 % [22]. To date,
numerous reports have examined the relationship between
ASD and TS [17, 18, 23–29], including several population-
based studies identifying a significant relationship between
TS and ASD above and beyond what would be expected by
chance [17, 30, 31]. However, highly variable rates of comor-
bidity between tic disorders and ASD have been reported,
ranging from 2.9 to 30.0 % [6, 9, 16•, 30–32]. This range of
incidence rates may be attributed to variable clinical samples
(e.g., severity of psychopathology, cognitive abilities) and/or
differences in research methodology (e.g., utilization of
treatment-seeking clinical samples versus population-based
samples).

Initial Case Reports and Case Series The association be-
tween ASD and tic disorders was initially described in single
case reports [33–37], including several describing the devel-
opment of tics following withdrawal from long-term neuro-
leptics [38–41]. It is unclear, however, whether the neuroleptic
medication use produced TS-like symptoms, or inadvertently
masked tics that would have already been in existence. These
early reports were followed by several case series presenting
an elevated concurrence of ASD and TS [29, 42–45], as well
as examples of tic development positively impacting autistic
symptoms in several young children (mostly males) [24]. Col-
lectively, these early reports spurred a growing interest and
discussion in regards to the potential genetic overlap between
the two disorders.

Larger Studies A consistent limitation in studies reporting
overlap between ASD and TS has been capturing large

cohorts of TS and/or ASD subjects. In 1999, Baron-Cohen
and colleagues identified 8.1 % of 37 school-aged children
with autism presenting with comorbid TS [32]. Later,
Canitano et al. [18] evaluated a clinical sample of 105 children
with ASD, observing 22 % with a tic disorder (11 % with TS
and 11 % with chronic motor tics) [18]. These findings sug-
gested that the rate of comorbidity was higher than what
would have been expected by chance; however, in both re-
ports, the small sample size limited the generalizability of
findings. Recently, the Tourette Syndrome International Con-
sortium was initiated to more accurately describe the comor-
bidity patterns of TS using a large cohort of individuals. Using
these data, Burd et al. [30] observed that 4.6 % of the 7288
participants with TS presented with a comorbid pervasive de-
velopment disorder (PDD), providing significant support that
TS increases the risk for PDD (including ASDs) 13-fold [30].
Further, the presence of TS and comorbid PDD significantly
increased the risk of additional comorbid psychopathology
(not including PDD), with nearly 98 % presenting with one
or more comorbidity versus 13.2 % in the group with TS only
[30]. These findings suggest that patients with TS and PDD/
ASD may present with a more complex diagnostic picture,
likely demanding more comprehensive and intensive man-
aged care.

Familial and Genetic Findings Several studies have identi-
fied a positive family history of TS and/or ASD in individuals
presenting with both disorders concurrently [18, 29, 30]. In a
clinical sample of 105 youth with ASD, Canitano et al. [18]
observed a positive family history for tic disorders in 59.5 %
of youth presenting with ASD and comorbid TS [18]. Burd
et al. [30] also identified an association between neuropsychi-
atric symptoms (including TS and ASD) and a deletion in-
volving exons 4, 5, and 6 of the gene neuroligin 4 (NLGN4)
in a family study [30]. To further delineate potential genetic
associations between TS and ASD, Fernandez et al. [46•] ex-
amined gene copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals
with TS (n=460) compared to control subjects (n=1131).
While no significant increases in the number of de novo or
transmitted rare CNVs were identified in TS subjects com-
pared to controls, gene mapping within rare CNVs in TS sub-
jects showed significant overlap with CNVs previously iden-
tified in individuals with ASD [7, 46•]. Taken together, these
findings reinforce the idea of a common pathogenetic mecha-
nism and shared genetic risk between the two disorders [7].

Neuropathological Similarities Given the growing evidence
suggesting an etiological overlap between TS and ASD, this
relationship has been investigated by several researchers via
psychopathological, neuropsychological, brain imaging, ge-
netic, and clinical studies. A recent review by Kern et al.
[47] observed several neuropsychological similarities between
TS, ASD, and ADHD, highlighting that these disorders may

Curr Dev Disord Rep (2015) 2:285–292

287

be part of a broader neurodevelopmental illness spectrum
(termed abnormal connectivity spectrum disorder [ACSD]),
resulting from neural processes that cause long-range
underconnectivity and short-range overconnectivity. These
connectivity abnormalities may be related to neurotoxicity,
neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, sustained microglial acti-
vation, proinflammatory cytokines, toxic exposure, and oxi-
dative stress [47]. Evidence also suggests that the severity of
connectivity deficits is associated with symptom severity in
TS, ASD, and ADHD [48]. Collectively, these data further
support the hypothesis that these disorders, though separate,
may share common risk factors or possibly etiology.

Similarities in Symptomology Beyond potential etiological
similarities, phenotypic overlap exists between TS and ASD.
First, there is a significant male predominance in both disor-
ders (approximately 60–80 %) [2, 49]. Second, these disorders
have many overlapping clinical symptoms, including social
deficits, speech abnormalities (e.g., echolalia or palilalia), sen-
sory abnormalities, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and re-
petitive motor behaviors [47, 50]. However, there are also
significant differences between the two disorders. For exam-
ple, speech abnormalities such as coprolalia may present in TS
but are not characteristic of ASD symptomology. In TS, dis-
ordered movements present as motor and vocal tics (i.e.,
repetitive, sudden, brief,
involuntary) while
ASD patients often present with stereotypies (i.e., repet-
itive, ritualistic, rhythmical, purposeful). Further, rigidity
and resistance to change, common features of ASD, are
somewhat distinct from the classic obsessive symptoms
that frequently co-occur with TS [51]. Specific differ-
ences between tics and stereotypies can usually be dif-
ferentiated by a thorough and comprehensive clinical
evaluation, providing an accurate differential diagnosis
[52]. A comparison of TS and ASD characteristics is
presented in Table 1.

Factors Impacting the Development of Social Deficits
in TS

Social skills deficits and/or interference has been identified in
youth with chronic tic disorders even in the absence of ASD
[2, 15, 16•, 19, 53–55]. Freeman et al. [19] examined 3500
youth with TS as part of an international population-
based study, with 20 % reporting deficits in social
skills. Similarly, Kadesjo and Gillberg [17] reported that
almost two thirds of their school-aged TS sample (N=
58) had major social
interaction problems (e.g., de-
scribed as being without a friend or had Bempathy
problems^), with only 14 % described as having no
major problems interacting with their peers [17].

Carter et al. [15] found that youth with TS and comorbid
ADHD had significantly more social adaptation problems (as
well as externalizing and internalizing behavior problems)
than unaffected control subjects or youth with TS alone. Fur-
ther, obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and distur-
bances in family functioning were significantly associated
with deficits in social, behavioral, and emotional functioning
among youth with TS, while increased tic symptom severity
was not [15]. This finding was consistent with three reports
[16•, 54, 56], but in contrast to several others identifying a
positive association between increased tic severity and deficits
in social/emotional functioning [57, 58]. This discrepancy
may be attributed to differences in sample characteristics
(e.g., inclusion of youth with more severe oppositional behav-
iors [57]) or analytic methodology (e.g., findings dependent
on medication status [58]).

Similarly, Sukhodolsky et al. [10] identified a significant
relationship between the presence of TS and deficits in social
functioning (e.g., having fewer friends, being rejected by
peers, not meeting the demands of everyday life) when com-
pared to control subjects. Youth with comorbid ADHD did not
significantly differ from youth without ADHD in these do-
mains; however, both groups were significantly different from
the control group. Further, the presence of disruptive behav-
iors (e.g., parent-reported aggression and delinquency) was
associated with increased social deficits and family dysfunc-
tion [10]. These findings are consistent with previous studies
reporting that aggressive behavior has the most detrimental
effect on peer relationship difficulties in non-TS school-aged
youth [59] and in youth with ADHD [60]. Storch et al. [19]
examined the impact of TS on youth using a parent-report
measure of functional impairment. In general, tic-related im-
pairment in a least one domain (school, home, social activi-
ties) was reported by 70 % of parents, with 42 % reporting at
least one significant problem interacting socially (e.g., prob-
lems making friends [21 %] or being around strangers [15 %])
[19]. In an Internet-based survey conducted by Conelea
et al. [54], parents and youth with TS reported significant
social interference due to symptoms, which was positively
associated with tic severity and the presence of psychiatric
comorbidities [54].

More recently, McGuire et al. [16•] found that youth with
TS or chronic tic disorders (N=99) had increased social defi-
cits (e.g., difficulties picking up social cues, interpreting social
cues, engagement in reciprocal social behavior) compared to
normative samples, with 19 % of TS youth exhibiting severe
social deficits. Although the presence of ADHD (without
comorbid OCD) and/or increased tic severity was not di-
rectly associated with social deficits, a positive relationship
was identified between increased social impairment and the
severity of inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositionality
[16•]. Similarly, Ghanizadeh and Mosallaei [6] observed a
significant proportion of TS youth with comorbid disruptive

behavioral disorders exhibiting greater parent-reported so-
cial problems compared to youth without
these co-
occurring behaviors [6]. These data are consistent with
existing literature describing significant social impairment
in youth with ADHD and/or commonly comorbid disrup-
tive behavior (with or without TS) [61]. Taken together,
these findings highlight the increased prevalence of social
deficits among individuals with TS and highlight the im-
pact of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (particularly
ADHD), disruptive behaviors, and/or increased tic severity
on social functioning.

Peer Relationship Problems in TS

In addition to the social deficits often reported in samples of
youth with TS, a few reports have also shed light on the peer
relationship problems that these youth often experience. Pre-
vious findings suggest that youth with TS are viewed as more
socially withdrawn and less popular than their peers [56, 62],
have difficulty getting along with their classmates [63], and
experience increased bullying or victimization by their peers
compared to youth with other chronic health conditions (type
1 diabetes) or healthy controls [12, 13•, 64]. Evidence also
suggests that peer victimization experienced by youth with
TS is positively associated with increased tic symptom sever-
ity, strength of premonitory urge, loneliness, internalizing
symptoms (e.g., anxiety and/or depression), explosive out-
bursts, and deficits in quality of life [12, 13•]. Peer victimiza-
tion was also identified as a mediator between tic symptom
severity and loneliness [12], suggesting that victimized youth
may perceive negative peer evaluations as veridical

information about themselves which can negatively shape
their self-concept and foster greater internalizing distress
[14•, 65, 66].

Social Deficits in Adults with TS

Although TS symptoms tend to decrease or remit once a child
reaches late adolescence, a considerable portion of individuals
exhibit tics into adulthood [67]. Previous research suggests
that social deficits in youth with TS may carry over into adult-
hood as well [68–70]. In a survey-based assessment of social
functioning in individuals with TS, Champion, Fulton, and
Shady [69] found that almost half of the adults within their
total sample (N=210) reported significant problems with dat-
ing as a result of their TS symptoms. This finding is consistent
with an earlier study reporting low marriage rates in adults
with TS [70]. Further, Shady et al. [68] found that adults with
TS reported significant interpersonal problems in the work-
place, including experiencing ridicule by coworkers and/or
employers about their tics, low job satisfaction, and discrimi-
nation in the workplace [68]. More recently, Conelea et al.
[71] conducted an Internet-based survey of 1216 adults with
TS to assess the impact of tics on functioning, finding that a
significant portion of the sample reported avoidance of social
situations and/or experienced discrimination due to their tics.
Further, from the adults employed within the last 12 months of
the study (n=461), a significant portion of the sample avoided
pursuing a job promotion (12 %) or avoided a job interview
(11.9 %) because of their tics, both of which positively corre-
lated with tic severity [71]. Evidence suggests that women
may also be at greater risk for tic-related social impairment

Curr Dev Disord Rep (2015) 2:285–292

289

and avoidance of social/group activities compared to men,
independent of tic severity [72].

Evidence-Based Interventions for Improving Social
Functioning in TS

Although substantial evidence exists for pharmacological and
behavioral interventions for tics [73], there is a paucity of
research evaluating the effectiveness of augmenting (or mod-
ifying) interventions to address social deficits within this pop-
ulation. Youth with tics may benefit from social skills training
to improve peer relationships and/or effectively respond to
teasing or rejection [74]. Educating youth and parents about
the greater social and emotional risks associated with their
condition and monitoring family functioning (e.g., stress re-
lated to chronic condition) in combination with evidenced-
based pharmacologic and/or behavioral treatments may also
be beneficial. Careful assessment should be done to ex-
amine tic-related impairment on an individual basis,
rather than assuming that all youth with TS have similar
problems [19].

Peer-Focused Interventions Recently, researchers have in-
vestigated TS intervention strategies that aim to improve the
social acceptability of the disorder, including self-disclosure
of diagnosis and/or educational outreach via video-based de-
livery. To date, there have been at least five studies evaluating
these interventions. First, Woods [75] randomly assigned sub-
jects to a group that either received an educational video about
TS or no video; then, all subjects watched an hour long video
of an actor portraying a person with TS. Their findings indi-
cated that subjects who watched the educational video were
more likely to positively rate the actor in regards to social
acceptability than those that did not watch the video [75]. In
a follow-up study, Woods and Marcks [76] compared groups
receiving either an educational video about TS, a similar video
about depression, or no video. Only subjects receiving the TS-
specific video demonstrated increased acceptability of TS,
indicating that this increase was not solely an effect of educa-
tional videos about mental health challenges [76]. Third,
Marcks et al. [37] found that the preventative self-disclosure
(compared to nondisclosure) of TS symptoms significantly
reduced negative perceptions of an individual with TS, regard-
less of gender or age. Fourth, Holtz and Tessman [77] found
that compared to a control group, youth exposed to a video-
based educational tool exhibited significant changes in knowl-
edge, positive attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward their
peers with TS [77]. More recently,
the effect of either
generic TS educational videos or personally delivered
self-disclosure on participant’s perceptions of individuals
with TS was compared. Although both conditions rated
their knowledge about
tics significantly higher than

those who did not watch any video, those who viewed
the actor personally self-disclose their symptoms had
higher ratings of social acceptability than those in the
generic TS education video [78]. Taken together, these
findings suggest that increasing TS awareness, especial-
ly when information is personally self-disclosed by
those with TS, can significantly improve the social ac-
ceptability of individuals with TS.

Conclusions

Existing research suggests an increased prevalence of comor-
bid ASD and/or disturbances in social functioning and peer
victimization among individuals with TS. While the precise
nature of these relationships is uncertain, both genetic factors
and co-occurring psychopathology have been implicated in
the etiology and/or maintenance of these difficulties. Over
the last few decades, researchers have identified several fac-
tors that may contribute to these social disturbances, highlight-
ing the negative impact of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses
(particularly ADHD), disruptive behaviors, and/or increased
tic severity. Evidence also suggests that peer victimization
experienced by youth with TS is associated with increased
tic symptom severity, strength of premonitory urge, loneli-
ness, internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety and/or depres-
sion), explosive outbursts, and deficits in quality of life. Al-
though several studies postulate that reducing these disabling
aspects of symptom presentations beyond tics will reduce the
overall burden of TS, most are cross-sectional or preliminary
in nature. As such, interventions for TS should aim to address
not only tic severity, but also the multifaceted reasons for
social deficits within this population.

in TS and control youth, providing evidence to support the
hypotheses that histaminergic and gamma-aminobutyric
acidergic mechanisms are involved in the etiology of TS, as well
as identifying significant overlap with CNVs in TS individuals
previously identified in individuals with ASD.
