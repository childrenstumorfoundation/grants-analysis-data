The KRAS oncogene product is considered a major target in anti-
cancer drug discovery1–3. However, direct interference with KRAS
signalling has not yet led to clinically useful drugs3–8. Correct local-
ization and signalling by farnesylated KRAS is regulated by the
prenyl-binding protein PDEd, which sustains the spatial organiza-
tion of KRAS by facilitating its diffusion in the cytoplasm9–11. Here
we report that interfering with binding of mammalian PDEd to
KRAS by means of small molecules provides a novel opportunity to
suppress oncogenic RAS signalling by altering its localization to
endomembranes. Biochemical screening and subsequent struc-
ture-based hit optimization yielded inhibitors of the KRAS–
PDEd interaction that selectively bind to the prenyl-binding pocket
of PDEd with nanomolar affinity, inhibit oncogenic RAS signal-
ling and suppress in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells that are dependent on
oncogenic KRAS. Our findings may inspire novel drug discovery
efforts aimed at the development of drugs targeting oncogenic
RAS.

The interaction between a biotinylated and farnesylated KRAS4B
peptide12 with His-tagged PDEd was used in an high-throughput
Alpha Screen (Supplementary Fig. 1) to identify small molecules that
bind to the farnesyl-binding pocket of PDEd. The screen yielded several

benzimidazole hits (for example, 1, Fig. 1a) which were further char-
acterized by means of a fluorescence polarization assay based on a
known PDEd ligand13 (KD 5 165 6 23 nM for compound 1), iso-
thermal titration calorimetry (KD 5 217 6 15 nM for 1) and change
in protein melting temperature upon interaction (see Supplementary
Figs 2, 3 and 4)14.

Crystal structure analysis of 1 in complex with PDEd at 1.87 A˚
resolution (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5) and comparison with
the previously obtained structure of the complex between PDEd and
farnesylated RHEB (root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.9 A˚ ),
revealed that two benzimidazoles bind into the hydrophobic tunnel in
PDEd (Fig. 1b). One molecule is deeply buried and overlaps with the
farnesyl-binding site. The second molecule is located in the vicinity of
the binding site that makes main chain contacts with two carboxy-
terminal RHEB amino acids. Binding of the inhibitors is mediated by
hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the benzimi-
dazole units and Tyr 149 and Arg 61 (Fig. 1b). Consistently, related
N-benzylated 2-phenylindole shows no binding (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Furthermore, the side chain of Trp 90 underwent a conformational
change resulting in a T stacking with inhibitor 1 (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Structure-guided design based on the crystal structure obtained for 1
in complex with PDEd suggested covalent linking of the benzimidazoles

Figure 2 | In-cell measurements of the effect of
deltarasin on the interaction of RAS with PDEd
and resulting delocalization of KRAS. a, FLIM
time series on MDCK cells expressing mCitrine–
RHEB and mCherry–PDEd show a loss of
interaction between RHEB and PDEd after
treatment with 5 mM deltarasin. Left panel,
representative sample of FLIM time series. Upper
two rows show fluorescence intensity distribution
of the indicated fluorescent fusion proteins,
whereas the lower two rows show maps of average
fluorescence lifetime (tav) in ns and computed
molar fraction (a) of interacting mCitrine–RHEB
with mCherry–PDEd. Time in minutes is indicated
above the panels. The deltarasin-induced
dissociation of mCherry–PDEd and mCitrine–
RHEB is represented in the time course of
normalized average ,a. 6 s.e.m. for N 5 5 cells
in the right panel. b, Left panel, deltarasin dose
dependence of molar fraction (a) of interacting
mCitrine–RHEB with mCherry–PDEd. Upper row
shows fluorescence intensity distribution of
mCitrine–RHEB, middle row shows average
fluorescence lifetime (tav) in ns and lower row
shows molar fraction (a) of interacting mCitrine–
RHEB with mCherry–PDEd. The concentration of
deltarasin is indicated at the top of the panel in nM.
Right panel, fit of averaged dose-response 6 s.e.m.
of four independent experiments to a binding
model (see methods) yielded an in cell KD of
41 6 12 nM for deltarasin binding to PDEd.
c, Time series of mCitrine–KRAS redistribution
upon application of 5 mM of deltarasin in PANC-1
(upper panel) and Panc-Tu-I (lower panel) cells.
Time in minutes is indicated above the panel. The
first and last time point of each cell line were used
to quantify the mCitrine–KRAS distribution in
these cells. The loss of plasma membrane
localization can be seen in the mCitrine–KRAS
intensity profiles along the white lines in the
fluorescence micrographs in the right panels. A.U.,

and synthesis of a focused library (Fig. 1a) with variation of the linker
structure (see the Supplementary Information). Covalent linkage via an
ether bond for instance yielded dimeric compound 2 (Fig. 1a), which
binds to PDEd with significantly increased affinity (KD 5 39 6 11 nM)
and with an almost complete overlap with the positions of the indi-
vidual benzimidazoles (Fig. 1c).

Investigation of the crystal structure of the complex (Fig. 1c) indicated
replacement of the allyl group at R for a larger cyclohexyl moiety, which
led to increased affinity (3, KD 5 16 6 2 nM, Fig. 1a), whereas introduc-
tion of a negative charge (R 5 CH2COOH, KD 5 870 6 290 nM, see
also Supplementary Table 1), omission of a substituent (R 5 H,
KD 5 116 6 29 nM) or increased steric bulk (R 5 Boc(4-piperidine),
KD . 2000 nM), yielded less potent ligands.

The proximity of the backbone carbonyl of Cys 56 to substituent
R (Fig. 1c) suggested introduction of a piperidine to introduce an

additional hydrogen bond (Fig. 1c). However, piperidine-containing
compound 4 (Fig. 1a) had lower affinity compared to 3, probably
due to rigidity of the linker that might not allow for three hydrogen-
bonding interactions.

Replacement of the phenyl ether by a flexible piperidine 4-carboxylic
acid ester resulted in an improvement of KD by almost one order of
magnitude (5, KD 5 10 6 3 nM, Fig. 1a). Crystal structure analysis of 5
in complex with PDEd confirmed the presence of a hydrogen bond
between the piperidine moiety in 5 and the carbonyl backbone of
Cys 56 (Fig. 1d). Replacement of the benzyl moiety with a 3-methyl
thiophene lead to a similarly potent compound (6, KD 5 9 6 2 nM,
Fig. 1a).

ative chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (Supplementary

and MAPK-signalling in oncogenic KRAS-dependent PDAC cells. a, Real-
time cell analysis (RTCA) of oncogenic KRAS-dependent Panc-Tu-I (upper
panel) and oncogenic RAS-independent PANC-1 (lower panel) PDAC cell
proliferation after doxycycline-induced PDEd knock-down. Cells were
transduced with shPDEd-572 doxycycline-inducible knockdown vector. Cell
indices 6 s.d. were measured in duplicates. Cells were treated with doxycycline
to induce PDEd knockdown from the beginning of the experiment (1 Dox).
b, RTCA of deltarasin dose PDAC cell proliferation response 6 s.d. of
oncogenic KRAS-dependent (Panc-Tu-I, upper panel) and KRAS-independent
(PANC-1, lower panel) cell lines shows deltarasin-induced suppression of
proliferation in oncogenic KRAS-dependent Panc-Tu-I cells. Deltarasin was
added at the indicated time point (arrow) and concentration (1–9 mM). The
inset in each panel shows deltarasin dose versus growth-rate response 6 s.d. as
determined from the average of the first derivative of the cell growth curves

determined between 35 and 65 h (Supplementary Fig. 15). c, EGF-induced

of three independent experiments for each cell line and condition. Cells were
analysed by FACS after 24 h of vehicle DMSO (black) and 5 mM deltarasin
incubation (red).

pure enantiomers revealed a four to sixfold difference in potency for
each pair of enantiomers ((S)-4 KD 5 38 6 16 nM vs (R)-4 KD 5
190 6 55 nM), and ((S)-6 KD 5 7 6 3 nM vs (R)-6 KD 5 39 6 18 nM.
The absolute configuration was assigned by analogy to a previously
reported synthesis (see the Supplementary Information)15. Tight
binding of (S)-4 and (S)-6 to PDEd was verified by means of a direct
titration using 5-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine (TAMRA)-labelled
(S)-4 (KD 5 7.6 6 1.3 nM) and TAMRA–(S)-6 (KD 5 5.3 6 1.5 nM,
Supplementary Fig. 8). TAMRA–(S)-4 and TAMRA–(S)-6 did not bind
to the PDEd-homologous GDI-like solubilizing factors HRG4/Unc119a

and Unc119b16,17, nor to the presumed prenyl-binding proteins galectin-
1 and galectin-3 (refs 18–20), indicating specificity for PDEd (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9). Compound 4 contains a hydrolytically stable ether
linker (as opposed to an ester in 6) and has appreciable solubility
and membrane permeability (Supplementary Information), (S)-4 was
therefore used in the following cell biological studies. We term this
compound deltarasin.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based fluor-
escence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements21 were used
to address whether deltarasin affected the interaction of PDEd with

KRAS in live cells. To this end, mCherry–PDEd was expressed together
with mCitrine-tagged farnesylated RAS variants (KRAS6Q mutant or
the RAS family protein RHEB) that lack part of the polybasic plasma
membrane interaction motif of KRAS. Thus, their soluble fraction and
interaction with PDEd are strongly enhanced9. This largely facilitates
the detection of the effect of small molecules on the interaction
between mCitrine-tagged farnesylated RAS and mCherry–PDEd in
the cytoplasm of live cells by FLIM. The fluorescence patterns of
mCitrine–RHEB or mCitrine–KRAS6Q and mCherry–PDEd in
Madine–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transiently co-transfected
with these proteins were homogeneous, showing a clear solubilization
of mCitrine–RHEB/KRAS6Q by mCherry–PDEd. A substantial drop
in the mCitrine fluorescence lifetime showed that FRET occurred
between the fluorescent proteins and corroborated that the solubiliza-
tion of RHEB/KRAS6Q was due to a direct interaction with PDEd
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10). Computation of the fraction of
interacting molecules (a) by global analysis of the fluorescence decay
profiles as obtained by FLIM21–23 showed that a significant fraction of
mCitrine–RHEB/KRAS6Q was in complex with mCherry–PDEd.
Within a minute, 5 mM of deltarasin completely inhibited this inter-
action and released the insolubilized mCitrine–RHEB/KRAS6Q to
the endomembrane system (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10).
This shows that deltarasin interferes with the binding of KRAS to
PDEd in cells and thereby inhibits its solubilization. Quantification
of the interaction between mCherry–PDEd and mCitrine–RHEB (or
mCitrine–KRAS6Q) in live cells by global analysis of FLIM data as
function of deltarasin dose (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 11) enabled
the computation of an ‘in cell’ KD of 41 6 12 nM (27 6 7 nM for the
mCitrine–KRAS6Q assay)
for the PDEd–deltarasin interaction,
remarkably similar to that determined for binding of deltarasin to
purified PDEd (38 6 16 nM).

By analogy to PDEd knockdown9, treatment of human pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell models PANC-1 and Panc-Tu-I
with 5 mM deltarasin led within 1 h to a clear loss of mCitrine–KRAS
(ectopically expressed) plasma membrane localization and its redis-
tribution to endomembranes (Fig. 2c). Immunofluorescence staining
of this type of PDAC cells with an anti-RAS antibody also showed that
deltarasin induced a random distribution of endogenous RAS to endo-
membranes (Fig. 2d). Direct binding of deltarasin to PDEd in live
PANC-1 cells could also be demonstrated by the occurrence of
FRET between monomeric teal fluorescent protein-tagged PDEd
(mTFP–PDEd) and TAMRA-tagged deltarasin, as seen by the signifi-
cant reduction in fluorescence lifetime of mTFP in the presence of
TAMRA–deltarasin (Fig. 2e). These experiments show that inhibition
of the PDEd–KRAS interaction by binding of deltarasin to PDEd leads
to a loss of KRAS spatial organization in PDAC cells, as maintained by
the solubilizing activity of PDEd9.

To assess the effect of deltarasin on oncogenic KRAS signalling, the
growth of PDAC cells that are dependent on oncogenic KRAS for their
survival (Panc-Tu-I and Capan-1 cells) was compared to PDAC cells
that are independent of oncogenic KRAS (PANC-1 cells)24 or express
wild-type KRAS (BxPC-3 cells)25. Transfection of these PDAC cells
with a lentiviral construct for doxycycline-inducible short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) expression against PDEd (Supplementary Figs 12
and 13) and treatment with doxycycline resulted in strongly reduced
cell proliferation and cell death of the KRAS-dependent Panc-Tu-I and
Capan-1 PDAC cell lines after 2–4 days and had only a slight effect on
the growth of the other cell lines (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 14a).
A similar effect on the proliferation of KRAS-dependent PDAC
cells was found with the PDEd inhibitor deltarasin (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Fig. 14b). The PDAC proliferation profiles as function
of deltarasin dose (1–9 mM) show that the KRAS-dependent Panc-Tu-
I cells show strongly reduced proliferation and increased cell death at
around 5 mM deltarasin, whereas KRAS-independent PANC-1 cells
only have a small negative dependence of growth rate on deltarasin
concentration (Fig. 3b, d and Supplementary Figs 15 and 16). The

LETTER RESEARCH

KRAS-dependent Capan-1 cells also showed strongly reduced prolife-
ration and increased cell death within hours upon treatment with 5 mM
deltarasin, whereas the wild-type KRAS-harbouring BxPC-3 PDAC
cells only had a slightly reduced initial growth rate and little or no
increase in cell death with respect to the control (Fig. 3d and Sup-
plementary Figs 14 and 16). These experiments indicate that the
reduced proliferation of KRAS-dependent PDAC cells is caused in
part by attenuated survival signalling from oncogenic KRAS that
is delocalized on endomembranes. The deltarasin concentration
(,3 mM, Fig. 3b) that induced a measurable effect on the proliferation
of Panc-Tu-I cells was higher than that of complete inhibition of the
interaction between PDEd and RAS (,200 nM, Fig. 2b). Because del-
tarasin was found to be stable to metabolism by PDAC cells
(Supplementary Fig. 17), this is probably due to the activity of ABC-
transporters26 that oppose the inward flux of the compound and
thereby lower its intracellular availability at longer times.

To address whether KRAS relocalization by deltarasin-mediated
PDEd inhibition has an effect on oncogenic KRAS signal transduction
by uncoupling it from its effectors at the plasma membrane9, the
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) response in serum-starved PDAC cells was studied.
Quantitative western blot analysis of the phosphorylated Erk1 and
Erk2 MAPKs showed that the KRAS-dependent Panc-Tu-I cells
had a high basal Erk activity that was reduced upon inhibition of
PDEd by deltarasin (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 18). Strikingly,
the two oncogenic KRAS-dependent PDAC cell lines (Panc-Tu-I
and Capan-1) showed a substantial reduction in the EGF-mediated
transient MAPK signal response as compared to the other cell lines
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs 14 and 18). The residual transient
MAPK response to EGF can probably be attributed to the remaining
wild-type RAS isoforms at the plasma membrane that are encoded by
the healthy (wild-type) alleles. Therefore, oncogenic KRAS-dependent
proliferative and survival signalling is strongly attenuated by the loss of
KRAS plasma membrane localization as caused by the inhibition of
PDEd–KRAS interaction by deltarasin.

To evaluate the anti-tumour activity of deltarasin, we administered
the compound to nude mice bearing subcutaneous human Panc-Tu-I
tumour cell xenografts and monitored tumour growth rate. Deltarasin
was administered by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection once (QD) or
twice (BID) per day. Three dosage regiments were tested (10 mg kg21
QD, 15 mg kg21 QD and 10 mg kg21 BID). An initial ,15% maximal
weight loss of mice injected with deltarasin could be observed during the
first 2 days of treatment, after which this stabilized in all groups (Sup-
plementary Fig. 19). A clear dose-dependent reduction in Panc-Tu-I

RESEARCH LETTER

tumour growth rate could be observed in deltarasin treated mice with
respect to the vehicle-injected controls, where the growth of tumours in
mice that were treated with 10 mg kg21 BID deltarasin was almost com-
pletely blocked (Fig. 4a). The negative effect of the compound on Panc-
Tu-I tumour growth could also be observed in the reduced variance in
tumour size with respect to the control as measured at day 9 (Fig. 4b).
Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the PDEd–KRAS inter-
action by means of small molecules affects the spatial organization of
KRAS and thus provides a novel opportunity to suppress oncogenic
RAS signalling and thereby tumour growth.

METHODS SUMMARY
Screening based on Alpha-technology was conducted in white, non-binding
1,536-well plates in a final volume of 6 ml (His6–PDEd, 100 nM, biotinylated
KRAS peptide 250 nM).

KD values were measured by fluorescence polarization measurements. For
direct titrations, increasing amounts of PDEd were added to a solution containing
50–100 nM labelled small molecule in 200 ml PBS buffer. For displacement titra-
tions, increasing amounts of the small molecules in DMSO were directly added to
fluorescein-labelled atorvastatin (24 nM) and His6-tagged PDEd (40 nM) in 200 ml
PBS-buffer (containing 0.05% CHAPS, 1% DMSO), keeping the concentration of
fluorescein-labelled atorvastatin, PDEd and DMSO constant.

For KD measurements using isothermal titration calorimetry, PDEd protein
(280 mM) was titrated to small molecule (30 mM) in Tris/HCl buffer (temperature
25 uC). In the Tm shift assays, protein melting points were detected by circular
dichroism spectroscopy in the presence of small molecules.

Inhibitors were co-crystallized with PDEd by mixing a solution of small mole-
cule and PDEd with DMSO 1.7% as a final concentration. Crystals were obtained
from a Qiagen crystallization screen.

For live-cell microscopy, cells were grown in four-well Lab-Tek chambers
(NUNC) and transferred to low-bicarbonate DMEM without phenol red supple-
mented with 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.4.

The following antibodies were used for western blotting: total Erk (Abcam-
AB36991; 1:2,000), pErk (Cell Signaling-9101; 1:2,000) and infrared secondary
antibodies (LI-COR).

Fluorescence lifetime images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning
microscope (FV1000, Olympus) equipped with a time-correlated single-photon
counting module (LSM Upgrade Kit, Picoquant). Intensity thresholds were
applied to segment the cells from the background fluorescence. Data were further
analysed as described in ref. 23 to obtain images of the molar fraction (a) of
interacting mCherry–PDEd/mCitrine–RHEB.

Real-time cell analyses were carried out by monitoring the proliferation for at

least 3 days after administration of the inhibitor.
