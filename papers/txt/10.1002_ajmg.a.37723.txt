Abstract

The RASopathies are a group of disorders due to variations of genes associated with the Ras/
MAPK pathway. Some of the RASopathies include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan 
syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, 
Costello syndrome, Legius syndrome, and capillary malformation–arteriovenous malformation 
(CM-AVM) syndrome. In combination, the RASopathies are a frequent group of genetic disorders. 
This report summarizes the proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Genetic Disorders 
of the Ras/MAPK pathway and highlights gaps in the field.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

Alterations of the Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) transduction pathway 
impact proliferation and differentiation of many cell types and lead to an array of 
phenotypes [De Luca et al., 2012]. A number of genetic syndromes due to mutations of 
genes of the Ras/MAPK pathway have been collectively termed RASopathies [Rauen, 
2013]. In aggregate, the RASopathies represent one of the largest groups of genetic 
disorders, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 1,000. Some of the 
RASopathies include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS),Noonan 
syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, 
Costello syndrome (CS), Legius syndrome, and capillary malformation–arteriovenous 
malformation (CM–AVM) syndrome. Although each RASopathy disorder presents with a 
distinct constellation of clinical problems, there is significant phenotypic overlap.

In order to better understand the molecular bases of the RASopathies and translate 
information across syndromes for better medical management and development of new 
therapies, a biannual symposium on RASopathies was initiated in 2009. This report 
summarizes the proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Genetic Disorders of the 
Ras/MAPK pathway held in July, 2015 in Seattle, Washington and highlights gaps in the 
field. The symposium included a broad array of trainees, clinicians, scientists, industry, 
advocates, funding agencies, and patients/families. The symposium is unique in its approach 
as it is held in conjunction with multiple advocacy meetings for RASopathy family/patient 
support groups. A poster session of submitted scientific abstracts and invited posters for 
representative parent/patient support groups was held to open the symposium allowing for 
interaction and discussion between the lay community and the scientific community. Details 
of specific sessions are provided below.

  PROCEEDINGS

  Keynote Presentation

The keynote speech by Frank McCormick provided a review of Ras signaling pathways and 
protein interactions of the NF1 product neurofibromin, which are required for Ras activity 
[McCormick, 2015]. He described a key role of SPRED proteins: neurofibromin binds 
directly to SPRED proteins, resulting in translocation to the plasma membrane, an essential 
interaction for neurofibromin to act on RAS. In the presence of active growth factor 
receptors, binding of SPRED proteins to neurofibromin is disrupted, allowing Ras GTP 
levels to accumulate. He highlighted that a detailed understanding of SPRED binding 
partners may lead to identification of novel therapeutic approaches. He emphasized the 
importance of neurofibromin as a major negative regulator of Ras, and that NF1 is 
frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. KRAS is significantly more potent than 
HRAS in tumorigenesis models, and he described the developing understanding of

differences between cells transformed by KRAS and by HRAS: cells transformed by KRAS, 
but not by HRAS, cause a stem-like phenotype. An interaction of KRAS (but not HRAS or 
NRAS) and calmodulin modulates tumor formation through inhibition of calmodulin kinase 
activity. Disruption of this interaction by the natural product prostratin suppresses tumor 
growth in preclinical models [Wang et al., 2015]. These findings and the existence of a new 
effector pathway specific for KRAS, therefore, offer new opportunities for therapeutic 
interventions.

  RASopathy Phenotypes (Shared and Discordant)

In this session, speakers were encouraged to discuss the main shared and discordant clinical 
features among RASopathies and provide potential measurable endpoints for clinical trials.

Bruce Korf discussed cancer predisposition in RASopathies. NF1 demonstrates a ≈10% 
average lifetime risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), as well as 
increased risk of other tumors, such as gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). For the other RASopathies, the overall malignancy risk 
is about ten-fold higher than the general population [Kratz et al., 2015], and highest for 
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) in CS and JMML in NS. Tumor studies have 
demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in NF1 neurofibromas, but more complex changes in 
MPNST and ERMS. He also described experiments in which an NF1 stop mutation mouse 
model has been created and is being used to test nonsense read-through drugs as a possible 
therapeutic strategy.

Mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in the RASopathies were discussed by Ype 
Elgersma. Mouse models suggest that the cognitive deficits in the different pathway 
disorders may have unique underlying mechanisms not easily predicted from knowledge of 
perturbations in the pathway. For example, the perturbations in hyperpolarization-activated 
cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel currents observed in the NF1 mouse model were not 
observed in the HRAS mouse model. Treatment trials in mice demonstrated different 
responses to medication, with statins rescuing cognitive deficits in both NF1 and NS (not 
confirmed by placebo controlled clinical trials in NF1 individuals), but having no effects on 
cognitive performance in adult CS mice. In addition, MEK inhibitors rescued the plasticity 
phenotype of CS mice but failed to rescue the cognitive deficits. A review of treatment trials 
[van der Vaart et al., 2016] in genetic cognitive disorders has shown very limited efficacy, 
and there is need for larger scale studies, international collaboration and improved reporting 
and design, particularly with predefinition of outcome measures.

Kathryn Chatfield provided a detailed description of cardiac manifestations in the 
RASopathy syndromes with discussion of targeted therapies. Noonan syndrome (NS) is the 
most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. In a large retrospective cohort 
study [Prendiville et al., 2014], cardiovascular involvement occurred in 81% of individuals 
affected by NS, most commonly pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defects, with cardiac 
hypertrophy occurring in 16%. There was a significant association between PTPN11 
mutations and both pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defect, whereas RAF1 mutations 
were associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). NS associated pulmonary 
stenosis was significantly more likely to require re-intervention after percutaneous balloon

valvuloplasty. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of infantile onset was more likely to regress 
(17%). Predictors of poor outlook include a mixed cardiomyopathy picture, onset less than 1 
year, and congestive cardiac failure at presentation. Although supraventricular arrhythmia 
was first associated with CS, with or without congenital heart disease or HCM, it has been 
reported in patients with mutations in RAF1, KRAS, and PTPN11, and may be refractory to 
treatment, and less likely to resolve with age than in CS. Clinical trials with MEK inhibitors 
are in development to evaluate the potential benefit on HCM in individuals with NS.

  Advocate Panel

The Advocates’ Panel, comprising Judy Doyle for CFC syndrome, Angelica Thomas for CS, 
Rosemary Anderson for NF1, Michelle Ellis for NS, and Tammy Bowers for NSML, 
advocated for research to address chronic pain in each of the syndromes. Similarities 
included joint pain, headaches, and abdominal pain—though there was a spectrum of 
severity and presentation. Lack of knowledge on the etiology and treatment of pain was a 
concern. Future studies characterizing pain in RASopathies are needed, and may not only 
improve patient management, but also lead to the development of pain as a meaningful 
endpoint in clinical trials.

  Preclinical Studies

The session on preclinical studies aimed at describing the RASopathies models currently in 
use in preclinical drug discovery and testing.

The session was opened by Katherine Rauen, who presented her lab’s efforts to evaluate the 
impact of Ras pathway activation in skeletal muscle development. She reviewed results on 
muscle biopsies from patients, demonstrating specific myopathic abnormalities, including 
muscle fiber size and variability of type-2 fiber (fast twitch) predominance, that are 
consistent with the muscle weakness and hypotonia observed in young patients with CS and 
CFC. She described the development of a skeletal myogenic culture assay that allows 
assessment of specific Ras/MAPK mutations and evaluation of pathway inhibitors.

Bruce Gelb described the use of a Drosophila NS (RAF1 mutation) model to perform a high-
throughput screen of a large (>14,000) chemical compound library. He explained the 
advantages of screening with a “whole organism” model rather than cultured cells to assess 
the role of drugs intended to modulate—rather than shutdown—the Ras pathway. The screen 
identified compounds capable of rescuing this NS fly’s lethality that will be further tested in 
iPS cells and mouse models.

Karlyne Reilly generated mouse MPNST cell lines and used them together with established 
human lines in high-throughput drug treatment assays. She emphasized the need to precisely 
evaluate dose responses in several cell lines to analyze heterogeneous responses of tumor 
cells. She proposed a stepwise drug screening strategy, where responses to candidate 
pathway inhibitors is progressively tested in an increasing number of cell lines, before being 
prioritized for in vivo work in murine tumor models.

Regulation of alternative splicing was proposed by Brage Andresen as a novel therapeutic 
strategy to modulate Ras overexpression. He described the molecular characterization of an

unusual germline HRAS mutation, which revealed the presence of an Exonic Splicing 
Enhancer (ESE) necessary for efficient splicing. The c.35_36GC>TG (p.G12V) mutation 
destroys the ESE motif, leading to exon skipping (and reduced mutant protein production), 
explaining the patient’s attenuated CS phenotype. Using splices-witching antisense 
oligonucleotides targeting crucial ESE sites, he showed how splicing can be modulated to 
knock-out activity of the resulting Ras protein and demonstrated the use of splice-switching 
antisense oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents in cancer cell lines carrying HRAS 
mutations.

Florent Elefteriou considered treatment for short stature, a phenotype commonly associated 
with RASopathies. Although the use of growth hormone therapy may be of concern in 
cancer-prone children, it has been used in these patients with satisfactory results. The 
etiology of RASopathies-associated short stature remains poorly characterized but can be 
studied in NS and CFC mouse models as they exhibit this phenotype. He discussed the 
efficacy of BMN111 (Biomarin), a RAF1-inhibitor currently in clinical trial for the 
treatment of achondroplasia (FGFR3), in promoting growth in an NF1 mouse model, and 
proposed that it may also be beneficial for other Ras-associated disorders.

The increasing number of RASopathies models under study attests of the complex pathology 
associated with these disorders. Evaluation of therapeutic approaches requires well-
characterized biological models. Using these parallel lines of research will contribute to 
disentangling the complexity and specificity of Ras signaling in different cell-types and 
tissues, a step necessary to the long-term goal of fine-tuning, and modulating the Ras 
pathway in clinical practice.

  Clinical Trials in RASopathies: Design, Endpoints, and Results

This session highlighted ongoing clinical trials efforts and reviewed successes, challenges, 
and pitfalls.

Brigitte Widemann described results from the NCI phase I trial of selumetinib, a specific 
MEK inhibitor, in children with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas [Widemann et 
al., 2014b]. Plexiform neurofibromas are benign tumors, which occur in up to 50% of 
individuals with NF1. Many are diagnosed at young age and grow the fastest in young 
patients. These tumors can cause substantial morbidity including pain, motor dysfunction, 
and airway compromise. The Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway is active in plexiform neurofibromas 
and in a genetically engineered mouse model of NF1 neurofibromas a MEK inhibitor 
resulted in substantial tumor shrinkage for the first time, supporting clinical trials with MEK 
inhibitors directed at plexiform neurofibromas [Jessen et al., 2013]. The maximum tolerated 
dose of selumetinib in this trial was 60% of the recommended dose for adults with solid 
cancers. At this dose selumetinib was well tolerated and all dose-limiting toxicities were 
reversible. Plexiform neurofibroma volume decreases were observed in more than 50% of 
the patients and associated with clinical improvement in some patients. This is the first 
clinical trial describing shrinkage of large plexiform neurofibromas in a substantial number 
of patients. Based on these promising findings a phase II trial is in development, which has 
the primary objective to confirm the response rate using volumetric MRI analysis, and as key 
secondary objectives to prospectively evaluate the effect of selumetinib on pain, quality of

life, and functional outcomes depending on the location of the PN. She emphasized the need 
for validated outcome measures in NF and the challenge of selecting appropriate patient 
reported and functional outcome measures given the variable locations of plexiform 
neurofibromas. She highlighted that recommendations from the Response Evaluation in 
Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) international working group proved very 
helpful for the selection of outcome measures and suggested that similar working groups 
might be beneficial for development of treatments for RASopathies [Plotkin et al., 2013].

The Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is involved in neuronal plasticity and long-term 
potentiation. In individuals with NF1, deregulation of this pathway is known to contribute to 
the development of tumors and is theoretically associated with neurocognitive deficits, 
specifically in the areas of memory, working memory, attention, and cognitive processing 
speed [Costa and Silva, 2002]. Karin Walsh described her ancillary pilot trial of the effect of 
Ras/MAPK inhibitors on neurocognitive function in NF1. Therapeutic trials targeting this 
pathway for the treatment of tumors in NF1 are underway and provide a unique opportunity 
to assess how the regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway may impact neurocognitive 
functioning in children, adolescents, and young adults with NF1. Patients with NF1 
enrolling on trials targeting the Ras/MAPK pathway for tumor manifestations have the 
opportunity to enroll on this ancillary study, which uses a novel, computerized assessment 
approach (Cogstate) [Costa and Silva, 2002] to examine change in cognitive function over 
the first 12 weeks of treatment. This pilot trial maximizes the opportunity for understanding 
the relationship between regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and cognitive functions from 
multiple ongoing treatment trials using a novel evaluative approach.

Amy Roberts described Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND)—funded 
research on NSML. The TRND program supports the pre-clinical development of 
therapeutic candidates intended to treat rare or neglected disorders, with the goal of enabling 
Investigational New Drug applications. In addition, because of the lack of published natural 
history data, TRND is conducting a multi-center retrospective analysis of individuals with 
NSML to analyze genotype, overall phenotype, medical history, and cardiac features as 
detailed by ECG, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, and/or exercise testing.

NSML is a rare genetic disease affecting only about 200 patients worldwide. Nearly all 
cases of NSML result from mutations in the PTPN11 gene. In the heart, the most common 
manifestation is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [Gelb et al., 2015]. There is no effective 
standard treatment for NSML patients who have HCM and end-stage heart failure can lead 
to early death. In animal models of NSML, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus can prevent and 
reverse HCM. Additional preclinical studies with similar agents are ongoing and may 
provide the basis for future clinical trials targeting HCM in patients with NSML.

Clinical trials for rare genetic syndromes present multiple challenges including the ability to 
enroll sufficient patient numbers in a timely manner. In addition, the varied clinical 
presentation of these conditions may require investigators to design multiple independent 
trials for patient subgroups with different clinical presentations. For example, several clinical 
trials may be developed to evaluate the activity of an experimental agent in NF2-related 
vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Scott Plotkin presented a

collaborative effort with Rebecca Betensky (Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, 
Boston, MA) to develop a novel statistical clinical trial design with individualized endpoint 
analysis in trials for NF. Patients with a heterogeneous disease and with patient-specific 
manifestations and associated endpoints for clinical trials will be considered for this design. 
For example, this design would be applicable to patients with NF1 and plexiform 
neurofibromas with different locations and associated morbidities: plexiform neurofibroma 
of the orbit causing vision loss, of the airway causing respiratory compromise, of motor 
nerves causing motor weakness, or plexiform neurofibromas causing pain. The design 
initially recruits all patient subtypes, each with its own, preselected endpoint. At an interim 
futility analysis, subgroups in which the treatment appears ineffective are discontinued, and 
recruitment continues with the remaining subgroups. Preliminary findings demonstrate that 
when a relatively rare subgroup responds to treatment, use of the proposed design can 
increase the overall power of the trial, though at the unavoidable expense of lengthening the 
time of the trial. The design also demonstrates superior power relative to the alternative of 
conducting separate trials for each patient subtype or using a composite endpoint for 
unselected patients. The proposed individualized endpoint design, in conjunction with an 
interim analysis for futility, may hold promise in some clinical scenarios.

In summary, this session described substantial advances required for conduct of meaningful 
clinical trials for RASopathies including the value of: i) longitudinal natural history data; ii) 
relevant preclinical models to screen for active agents; iii) novel trial designs and applicable 
endpoints; and iv) international working groups with the goal to establish consensus in 
clinical trials.

  Collaborations, Industry, and Funding

The goal of this session was to discuss mechanisms of collaboration with advocacy groups, 
academia, industry, and government agencies, which can accelerate the translation of 
promising preclinical findings into the clinic.

To set the stage, Michael Fisher provided an overview of agents targeting Ras/MAPK in 
clinical development and highlighted specific considerations for RASopathies. Somatic 
mutations in the MAPK pathway genes occur in greater than 30% of sporadic malignancies, 
and have been identified in many of the genes implicated in RASopathy syndromes, 
including NF1, PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, and MEK Efforts to target the MAPK 
pathway genes with single agent inhibitors have had mixed success and include the use of 
the farnesyl transferase inhibitor tipifarnib [Widemann et al., 2014a] and the antisense 20-
mer oligodeoxy-nucleotide targeted to HRAS [Alberts et al., 2004]. There are three FDA 
approved BRAF inhibitors: Sorafenib, which also targets other receptor tyrosine kinases, and 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which are FDA approved for V600E melanoma. Although 
mutations in MEK are rare in cancer, they represent an attractive target for Ras/MPAK 
driven cancers, as ERK 1/2 are the only known targets of MEK 1/2. Early experience with 
the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF1-assoicated plexiform neurofibromas is promising 
(NCT01362803) [Widemann et al., 2014b]. More recently, clinical trials of inhibitors of 
ERK have begun (NCT01781429, NCT02296242). Although MAPK pathway targeting is 
promising, challenges remain. Identification of the appropriate inhibitor will depend on the

specific molecular abnormality and tumor type. Thus far, many of the agents appear to be 
cytostatic; therefore, single target therapies may be unlikely to permanently eradicate 
tumors. The development of resistance to single agent therapy is common and multiple 
mechanisms have been described including paradoxical activation of other MAPK pathway 
proteins [Gibney et al., 2013], upregulation of growth factor or growth factor receptors, and 
activation of parallel signaling pathways (e.g., PI3 K pathway). In order to increase efficacy 
and overcome resistance, future therapy will likely be combinatorial and focused on 
targeting multiple MAPK pathway members, or utilizing MAPK pathway inhibitors along 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or inhibitors of the PI3 K pathway, transcription (e.g., cell 
cycle inhibitors), or translation.

The NCI intramural research program has a long track record of studying rare tumors. 
Recognizing the potential to better leverage the expertise of NCI intramural investigators to 
more effectively translate potential new therapies for rare tumors, the NCI Rare Tumors 
Initiative was launched in 2013. Abby Sandler explained that the main focus of the initiative 
is to foster collaborations of laboratory-based investigators with clinical investigators to 
more effectively and efficiently translate basic findings to the clinic. In addition, the 
initiative emphasizes the need for state of the art comprehensive analyses of biopsy materials 
or other tissue collected during clinical trials by basic investigators to better inform future 
clinical trials. She highlighted the first two pilot projects of the initiative: i) a phase II study 
of a γ–secretase inhibitor in adults with desmoid tumors and/or aggressive fibromatosis. The 
NCI had not previously conducted trials specifically for desmoid tumors. With help from the 
Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, enrollment on this trial was completed within less 
than 1 year, highlighting the benefits of close collaboration with advocacy groups. ii) A pilot 
study of clinical, imaging, and genomic studies in patients with NF1 and tumors considered 
at risk for malignant transformation. NCI support for the genomic and imaging studies 
allowed for optimal analysis of clinical information and tumor samples in the small number 
of patients studied. The initiative plans to identify and support additional collaborations of 
basic and clinical researches in rare tumors with unmet need for effective therapies.

As an example of the efforts of advocacy groups towards the identification of effective 
therapies, Annette Bakker presented the work and business model of the Children’s Tumor 
Foundation (CTF). The CTF works to find cures for the approximately 1 in 3,000 people 
living with NF, which encompasses three distinct genetic disorders: NF1, NF2, and 
schwannomatosis. NF is associated with multiple clinical manifestations and different 
challenges in the development of effective therapies. She described that the traditional model 
of funding research by passively providing grants to promising scientists was not resulting in 
an expedient development of effective treatments. The CTF thus completely revised the 
funding model in order to build new mechanisms, create strategic partnerships, and foster a 
spirit of collaboration between the many different stakeholders inside and even outside the 
NF landscape: patients, researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and the 
biotechnology sector. While CTF continues to provide grants to promising scientists for 
interesting research, the foundation was rebuilt to fill the gaps to develop a fast and efficient 
translation of basic discovery into clinical benefit. All of the “investment” choices are made 
with the main goal to set in motion a process that promises to get treatments into the hands 
of their patients quickly. She highlighted several of the novel approaches taken by the CTF.

For example, recognizing the need for biomarkers in NF, the CTF invested in building a state 
of the art biobank, which will be accessible to the entire research community. An NF patient 
registry was developed to identify patients suitable for future clinical trials with specific NF 
manifestations. The CTF has created Synodos as a funding mechanism of highly 
collaborative and committed research teams with broad expertise to accelerate identifying 
active therapies for NF.

This session concluded with a panel discussion with representatives from four 
pharmaceutical companies. Industry representatives emphasized that the rarity of a disease 
alone would not preclude from the development of an agent by a company. Several 
companies have embarked in clinical trials for very rare diseases. However, companies 
emphasized the critical need of a comprehensive understanding of the target population to 
consider clinical evaluation of a novel agent for rare tumors, including knowledge of: i) the 
incidence and natural history of the rare disease and its manifestations; ii) the number of 
patients potentially available for a clinical trial; and iii) meaningful trial endpoints that can 
be reproducibly measured. The identification of a target for therapy and a strong scientific 
rationale for evaluation of an agent in the target population were considered as the most 
critical requirement. The availability of patient registries and strong collaborations of 
academia, patient advocacy groups, industry, and regulatory agencies were also considered 
critical to the success of clinical trials in very rare diseases. Patient engagement also has a 
critical role in research. Funding opportunities that involve patients as partners in research at 
every stage was discussed.

  Young Investigator Abstracts

From the abstracts submitted by young investigators, three finalists were selected for 
platform presentation.

Shin-ichi Inoue reported on developmental defects and therapeutic interventions in a BRAF 
Q241R/+ knock-in mouse model, reflecting the most common BRAF p.Q241R mutation 
seen in patients with CFC syndrome. These mice showed embryonic or neonatal lethality 
mostly owing to liver necrosis and edema, as well as craniofacial abnormalities. Prenatal 
treatment with a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) rescued the embryonic lethality. Combination 
treatment with the MEK inhibitor and a histone 3 demethylase inhibitor (GSK-J4) further 
increased the rescue, suggesting that epigenetic modulations, as well as ERK pathway 
inhibition may be potential therapeutic strategies in the treatment of RASopathies.

Elizabeth Pierpont studied children with NF1 and NS in order to compare social function in 
these two common RASopathies. She analyzed 21 individuals with NF1, 21 with NS and 20 
unaffected siblings, and found lower overall social competence in the individuals with a 
RASopathy with no difference in social competency between NS and NF1. In children with 
NF1, problems with social-pragmatic language ability and externalizing behaviors were the 
strongest predictors of social skills, whereas social motivation and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder symptoms were most associated with social competence in those with 
NS.

Katherine Robbins reported on a cohort of 118 patients with CS and their HRAS mutation 
spectrum. Samples from embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) of seven individuals were 
studied at the molecular, transcriptional and cytogenetic levels, and compared to sporadic 
nonsyndromic tumors. All seven individuals carried a paternally derived HRAS mutation 
affecting G12, and their ERMS was characterized by a complete loss of the wild-type 
maternally derived G12 allele. Complete uniparental disomy with loss of the maternal 
chromosome 11 was present in all but one CS ERMS. Complete loss of heterozygosity was 
also observed in many sporadic tumors with and without RAS mutations, indicating that loss 
of heterozygosity in itself is an important driver for this cancer. Katherine Robbins received 
the Young Investigator Award for her work.

These studies on patient samples and matched tumor samples, mouse models and potential 
pharmacological interventions, and the effect of RASopathies on social functioning, 
highlight the pleiotropic effects of RASopathies, as well as the numerous potential endpoints 
for therapeutic strategies aimed at improving patient lives.

  Engaging Families

This symposium included methods to build mutual understanding between researchers, 
clinicians, industry members and families. The poster session, open to families and 
professionals, included posters of patients and researchers. The patients’ posters elucidated 
phenotypes of CFC, CS, NF1, NS, and NSML and provided a window into their lives. 
Researchers were able to educate family members on the latest scientific findings in patient-
centric terms. Along with the poster session and the Advocates’ Panel, researchers shared 
findings from the symposium with the CS, CFC, NS, and NF1 families in break-out 
sessions, providing an opportunity for the families to better understand the progress of 
research toward understanding and increasing the quality of their lives.

  RASopathy Cousins

In the RASopathy Cousins session, disorders caused by mutations in genes in pathways 
related to the RAS pathway were discussed. In the first presentation, Kim Keppler-Noreuil 
described the recent advances in the segmental overgrowth disorders, in which somatic 
activating mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly 
PIK3CA mutations, have been found to be causative. These include Fibroadipose 
hyperplasia or Overgrowth (FAO), Hemihyperplasia Multiple Lipomatosis (HHML), 
Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth, Vascular Malformations, Epidermal Nevi, Scoliosis/
Skeletal and Spinal (CLOVES) syndrome, macrodactyly, Fibroadipose Infiltrating 
Lipomatosis, and the related megalencephaly syndromes, Megalencephaly-Capillary 
Malformation (MCAP or M-CM), and Dysplastic Megalencephaly (DMEG). Researchers 
recently met at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create consensus guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of individuals with these entities, designated as “PIK3CA -Related 
Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)” [Keppler-Noreuil et al., 2015]. A nonrandomized, phase II 
pilot trial with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus is being conducted at NIH, in patients aged ≥3 
and ≤65 years, with a confirmed somatic PIK3CA mutation and progressive overgrowth. The 
objectives of the trial include determination of the effect size of sirolimus therapy in 
reducing pathological overgrowth in PROS by evaluating the use of objective therapeutic

endpoints for measuring serial changes in growth. These include volumetric MRI analysis, 
and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for body composition (fat, muscle, and skeletal 
tissues), along with physical exam measurements of overgrown body parts. In addition, 
quality of life measures in pre- and post-treatment periods are being assessed. These results 
will inform a future randomized control trial with a potential drugs directly targeting the 
PI3K pathway.

Pinar Bayrak-Toydemir discussed the RASA1-related disorders. The RASA1-related 
disorders are characterized by capillary malformations, which can be associated with 
arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, or Parkes Weber syndrome. She 
described the clinical characteristics of the patients with RASA1 mutations and the possible 
complications including hemorrhage, neurological consequences and congestive heart 
failure. She discussed the clinical and molecular findings in 50 unrelated cases with RASA1 
mutations. Of the patients with mutations in RASA1, 74% had multifocal capillary 
malformations and 50% had arteriovenous malformations or arteriovenous fistulas. RASA1 
sequencing should be considered for patients with multifocal capillary malformations.

David Neal Franz discussed the therapeutic options for tuberous sclerosis complex, 
including the mTOR inhibitors sirolimus, and everolimus. The current FDA approved 
tuberous sclerosis-related indications for the mTOR inhibitors include subependymal giant 
cell astrocytoma, renal angiomyolipoma, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Off-label use of 
topical sirolimus has also been used for the treatment of facial angiofibromas. He also 
discussed clinical trials using mTOR inhibitors in tuberous sclerosis, focusing on long-term 
safety and efficacy. He reported the medications were well tolerated and side effects 
decrease with long-term use.

Antonio Hardan gave a presentation on the PTEN Project. This project focused on treatment 
of the neuro-cognitive deficits in patients with PTEN mutations. He described a new study, 
which will be a 6-month randomized, double-blind, multi-site study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of everolimus in 40 children with PTEN mutations. The study will focus on the 
effect of everolimus on working memory and processing speed deficits, overall global 
clinical functioning, autism symptoms, and adaptive abilities.

In summary, the “RASopathy cousins” session focused on recent advances in the diagnosis, 
evaluation and emerging therapies for the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, the 
RASA1-related disorders, tuberous sclerosis complex, and PTEN-related disorders. The 
mTOR inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for a wide range of complications in these 
disorders ranging from overgrowth of tissue and tumors to treatment of cognitive function. 
Future studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these agents for these 
disorders. Additional future studies may focus on more targeted agents to treat these 
conditions.

  CONCLUSIONS

The 4th International Symposium on Genetic Disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway provided 
a forum for discussion between scientists, families, and industry about the state of the field
