Mechanistic insight into ALK 
receptor tyrosine kinase in human 
cancer biology

Bengt Hallberg and Ruth H. Palmer

Abstract | The burgeoning field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in cancer encompasses 
many cancer types, from very rare cancers to the more prevalent non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). The common activation of ALK has led to the use of the ALK tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib in a range of patient populations and to the rapid development of 
second-generation drugs targeting ALK. In this Review, we discuss our current 
understanding of ALK function in human cancer and the implications for tumour treatment.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was discovered 
through  the  identification  of  a  2;5  chromosomal 
translocation in anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (ALCL)1. The nucleophosmin (NPM)–
ALK fusion protein produced by this rearrangement1,2 
results in constitutive activation of the ALK kinase, 
which is normally regulated by the extracellular ligand-
binding domain in the full-length receptor 1,3,24. We 
now know that ALK activation in cancer can also arise 
through overexpression and mutation of full-length 
ALK4–6 (FIG. 1). Just when and where does ALK activa-
tion become a ‘troublemaker’ in the context of human 
tumours? ALK alterations have been described in several 
human cancers, but it is not fully understood whether 
these reflect a true tumorigenic role of ALK. In the case 
of ALK translocations, the ALK fusion proteins that have 
been examined seem to have an important role in driv-
ing tumorigenesis. In tumours in which full-length ALK 
is mutated, such as in neuroblastoma and thyroid cancer, 
the picture is less clear, although the overriding genetic 
evidence in neuroblastoma implicates mutant ALK as 
an important oncoprotein.

ALK function
ALK function in mice and humans. The single ALK 
locus in mice and humans encodes a classical receptor 
tyrosine kinase (RTK) that comprises an extracellular 
ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and 
an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (FIG. 2). Together 
with the related leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) recep-
tor, ALK constitutes a subfamily within the insulin 
receptor superfamily on the basis of kinase domain 
similarities. The extracellular domains of ALK and LTK 
are unique among RTKs, as they contain a glycine-rich 

region and, in the case of ALK, additional LDLa and 
MAM domains6. Pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) 
have been reported as activating ligands for mamma-
lian ALK7,8. These small heparin-binding growth fac-
tors have a role in neural development, survival and 
tumorigenesis9,10. MK and PTN are also able to acti-
vate other receptors, including receptor protein tyros-
ine phosphatase-β (RPTPβ) and RPTPζ, N-syndecan, 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 
and integrins6. PTN can also function via the RPTPβ 
and RPTPζ phosphatases to activate ALK signalling11. 
Currently, the stimulation of ALK by PTN and MK 
remains controversial, as some groups have shown PTN- 
and MK-mediated ALK activation, whereas others have 
reported contradictory results12–15. Therefore, in contrast 
to non-vertebrate model organisms, such as Drosophila 
melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the natural 
ligand for mammalian ALK remains enigmatic.

Similarly, the precise physiological role of ALK in 
mammals is unclear. Some interesting observations 
have been made in patients treated with ALK inhibitors. 
The ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib16,17 
is remarkably well tolerated, but reports from human 
clinical trials using crizotinib describe unexplained 
side effects, such as reduced heart rate18, suppression 
of testosterone levels in men19 and visual disturbances 
— effects that are reversible on discontinuation of 
treatment20,19. Whether these observations represent 
ALK-specific effects or off-target effects of crizotinib 
will require more thorough exploration, especially as 
a recent Phase I/II clinical trial examining the effect of 
the CH5424802 ALK inhibitor reported lower levels 
of visual symptoms than those observed with crizo-
tinib treatment21. Overall, ALK expression patterns in

Key points

•	Anaplastic	lymphoma	kinase	(ALK)	is	involved	in	the	initiation	and	progression	of	

many	different	cancer	types,	including	lymphomas,	neuroblastoma	and	non-small-cell	
lung	cancer.	It	is	clear	that	ALK	can	be	activated	by	translocation,	as	well	as	by	
mutation.	The	ALK	locus	is	a	hotspot	for	activating	translocation	events,	with	22	
different	translocation	partners	identified.	The	resulting	ALK	fusion	proteins	are	
found	in	a	wide	range	of	cancer	types.	An	alternative	mechanism	for	ALK	activation	is	
through	point	mutation	of	the	ALK	locus,	most	commonly	within	the	kinase	domain,	
as	reported	in	patients	with	neuroblastoma	and	thyroid	cancer.

•	The	physiological	function	of	ALK	in	mammals	is	enigmatic,	although	it	is	clear	that	

ALK	is	not	required	for	viability,	as	Alk−/−	mice	are	viable.	The	role	of	ALK	in	model	
systems,	such	as	Drosophila melanogaster,	Caenorhabditis elegans	and	Danio rerio,	is	
more	clearly	defined	in	development,	with	ALK	signalling	used	repeatedly	in	a	
spatially	and	temporally	regulated	manner.	In	both	D. melanogaster	and	C. elegans,	
ALK	also	has	genetically	defined	ligands.

•	The	spatial	and	temporal	expression	pattern	of	the	different	oncogenic	ALK	fusion	

proteins	is	determined	by	the	fusion	partners.	Furthermore,	although	not	well	studied,	
comparisons	of	the	different	ALK	fusion	proteins	suggest	that	they	display	differences	
in	signalling	and	in	transforming	and	tumorigenic	potential.

•	The	first	clinically	approved	drug	to	target	ALK	—	crizotinib	—	is	a	tyrosine	kinase	

inhibitor	(TKI)	that	was	approved	by	the	US	Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA)	for	
use	in	ALK-positive	non-small-cell	lung	cancer.	Recent	reports	suggest	that	ALK	
TKIs	will	be	useful	in	the	treatment	of	other	less	frequently	occurring	ALK-positive	
cancer	types.	A	number	of	second-generation	ALK	TKIs	are	currently	in	clinical	
trials	and	are	able	to	inhibit	secondary	‘resistance’	mutations	that	are	found	in	
patients	treated	with	crizotinib.

•	Several	important	issues	remain	to	be	addressed,	such	as	cooperativity	between	ALK	

and	other	oncogenes	and	tumour	suppressors,	the	differences	in	signalling	output	
between	different	ALK	oncogenes,	the	streamlined	identification	of	ALK-positive	
patients	in	multiple	cancer	types,	putative	combinatorial	drug	strategies	for	patients	
and	an	explanation	for	why	the	ALK locus	is	a	hotspot	for	translocation.

Dauer
In Caenorhabditis elegans, 
dauer refers to the entry of the 
animal into an arrested state 
when environmental conditions 
are not favourable for further 
growth. During the dauer state, 
feeding is indefinitely arrested 
and locomotion is markedly 
reduced. The dauer state ends 
when the animal experiences 
favourable conditions.

Neural crest
The neural crest originates from 
the neural tube and migrates 
outwards as a transient, 
multipotent migratory cell 
population that is unique to 
vertebrates. The neural crest 
gives rise to diverse cell 
lineages, including melanocytes, 
neuroendocrine cells, 
craniofacial cartilage and bone, 
smooth muscle, peripheral and 
enteric neurons, and glia.

Iridophore
A pigment cell derived from the 
neural crest and found in many 
animals. Iridophores contain 
crystals that reflect different 
wavelengths of light, which 
give them an apparent colour, 
although no true pigment is 
present.

chickens, mice, rats and humans suggest key roles in 
the development of the nervous system3,22–27. It should 
be noted that ALK mRNA and protein levels seem to 
diminish in all tissues after birth — they reach their 
minimum levels at 3 weeks of age and are maintained at 
low levels in adult animals3. Only mild behavioural phe-
notypes have been described in Alk-knockout mice28–30, 
which is in keeping with the good tolerance of patients 
to ALK inhibitors. Double knockout Alk−/− Ltk−/− mice 
have also been reported to be viable30, suggesting that 
pharmacological inhibition of ALK before adulthood, 
for example in children with ALK+ tumours, may offer 
a tolerable clinical option.

Insight into ALK function from model systems. An 
increasing amount of knowledge regarding the func-
tion of ALK is being accumulated from model systems, 
such as D. melanogaster, C. elegans and the zebrafish 
Danio rerio. In contrast to mice and humans, there is 
only one ALK family member in C. elegans (called sup-
pressor of constitutive dauer formation 2 (SCD-2)) and 
in D. melanogaster (called Alk)31–33. In zebrafish there 
are two members of the ALK family, which are encoded 
by ltk and alk34,35 (TABLE 1). ALK-activating ligands are 
Jelly belly (Jeb) in D. melanogaster 36–39 and hesitation 
behaviour 1 (HEN-1) in C. elegans32,40. These are rather 
unusual secreted ligands that both contain a low-density  
lipoprotein-receptor class A (LDLRA) domain. To 
date, no such ligand has been reported to activate ALK  
signalling in vertebrate systems.

In D. melanogaster, Jeb–Alk signalling is required 
for survival and is highly spatially and temporally regu-
lated. It is involved in the specification of founder cells in 
embryonic visceral muscle36–39, the development of neu-
ronal circuitry in the visual system41, the development of 
synapses of the neuromuscular junction42 and is involved 
in the regulation of body size, learning and memory43. 
Other functions of ALK signalling in D. melanogaster 
include the protection of neuroblasts during nutrient 
deprivation44 and a role in alcohol resistance29.

In C. elegans, HEN-1–SCD-2 signalling is non-
essential for nematode development, but it seems to be 
required for the integration of sensory inputs. SCD-2 
was originally identified in a screen for mutants that 
suppress constitutive dauer formation45, implicating 
ALK signalling in the regulation of the transforming 
growth factor-β (TGFβ) dauer formation pathway in 
C. elegans. Crosstalk between ALK and TGFβ pathways 
is not unique to nematodes, as D. melanogaster Alk 
has been reported to induce expression of the TGFβ 
homologue, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), in the embryonic 
visceral mesoderm46. Further parallels between ALK 
signalling in C. elegans and D. melanogaster can be 
drawn at the neuromuscular junction, where SCD-2 
signalling is important for the regulation of presynaptic 
differentiation in C. elegans31.

In zebrafish, both ALK family members have been 
functionally described. ltk was originally described as 
the shady locus in a screen for neural crest development 
mutants47. The shady phenotype refers to the loss of the 
neural crest-derived iridophore pigment cell pattern, 
reflecting the lack of specification of these cells in the 
ltk (previously known as shady) mutant35. Unusually, 
zebrafish Ltk contains a MAM domain and is in this 
respect — together with its expression pattern in the 
neural crest — more similar to ALK than to other LTK 
homologues. ALK has recently been reported to have a 
role in neurogenesis in the developing zebrafish central 
nervous system (CNS)34. Although ligands for ALK and 
LTK have yet to be described in zebrafish, their roles 
in the developing CNS and neural crest suggest that 
this model system may provide important information 
regarding mammalian ALK signalling. Insight into the 
role of ALK family RTKs in neural crest development 
may be of particular importance in the understanding 
of neuroblastoma, which is a tumour of neural crest 
origin, in which activating ALK mutations have been 
described (discussed below)48–52.

In parallel to the advances being made in our under-
standing of the role of ALK signalling during develop-
ment in model systems, these models are being used 
to understand the role of ALK in cancer. For example, 
a number of human neuroblastoma ALK mutants have 
been assayed for ligand-independent activity and sen-
sitivity to ALK inhibitors by ectopic expression in the 
D. melanogaster eye53,54. Transgenic zebrafish have also 
been developed to examine the role of ALK in neuro-
blastoma development55, and the iridophore phenotype 
of the ltk mutant is phenocopied by ALK TKIs, exploiting 
an in vivo zebrafish assay for examining combinatorial 
strategies for ALK inhibition56.

(ALK)-positive cancers. ALK fusion proteins (shown in beige), in which the kinase domain of ALK is fused to the 
amino-terminal portion of various proteins, have been described in numerous cancers, such as anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), renal medulla carcinoma (RMC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer, colon carcinoma, serous 
ovarian carcinoma (SOC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ALK overexpression, although 
mechanistically not understood, has been reported in various cancer types and cell lines (pink). ALK mutations comprise a 
third category (blue), and include both primary tumour-associated mutations and secondary mutations that are observed 
in crizotinib-resistant patients. Secondary mutations in the context of ALK fusions have been described in NSCLC, IMT 
and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). ALK point mutations have been found mainly in neuroblastoma, as well as in 
NSCLC and ATC; most of the mutations are situated within the kinase domain of ALK. ALO17, ALK lymphoma

Investigation of ALK signalling in model systems has 
led to many insights into the function of this RTK in 
developmental processes. There are a number of remain-
ing issues, such as that of a Jeb- or HEN-1-like ligand 
for vertebrate ALKs — whether one exists at all, and if 
so what role it has in the development of tissues such 
as the neural crest in vertebrates. With their controlled 
genetic backgrounds, model systems have the potential 
to provide useful information on ALK mutants found in 
human cancer and on the sensitivity of these mutants to 
various inhibitors.

ALK signalling. A complete picture of ALK signalling 
is challenging to piece together, as current information 
is gleaned from the study of multiple forms of activated 
ALK (fusion proteins, cancer-associated mutants and 
amplifications), and we should therefore be cautious in 
how we apply this knowledge. Most information regard-
ing ALK signalling comes from studies of oncogenic ALK 
fusion proteins such as NPM–ALK and echinoderm 
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)–ALK, 
and has been complemented in recent years by studies 
of oncogenic full-length ALK mutants, such as those 

identified in neuroblastoma. Targets of the ALK fusion 
proteins are likely to include both ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ tar-
gets and pathways, given that ALK activity has lost its 
normal spatial and temporal restraints, which are deter-
mined by the respective fusion partners. The different 
fusion partners affect ALK homodimerization, as well as 
ALK signalling potential57. Indeed, the comparison of a 
number of ALK fusion proteins suggests differences in 
transforming and tumorigenic potential58.

In terms of general signalling output, ALK acti-
vates multiple pathways, including phospholipase Cγ 
(PLCγ), Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and acti-
vator of transcription (STAT), PI3K–AKT, mTOR, sonic 
hedgehog (SHH), JUNB, CRKL–C3G (also known as 
RAPGEF1)–RAP1 GTPase and MAPK signalling cas-
cades, which affect cell growth, transformation and anti-
apoptotic signalling5,6,59,60 (FIG. 3). ALK signalling involves 
adaptors such as Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor 
target 2 (SNT2; also known as FRS3)–fibroblast growth 
factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), insulin receptor sub-
strate 2 (IRS2), SHC and growth factor receptor-bound 
protein 2 (GRB2), and it also affects more downstream 
targets, such as BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell

death (BIM; also known as BCL2L11), p27 (also known 
as KIP1 and CDKN1B) and cyclin D2, which are vital 
components for cell survival and growth5,6,59,60. Other 
interesting but less well characterized targets of ALK 
fusion protein signalling include nuclear interacting 
partner of ALK (NIPA; also known as ZC3HC1)61,62, the 
small GTPases RAC1 and cell division control protein 
42 (CDC42)63,64, p130CAS (also known as BCAR1)65, 
the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 
(also known as PTPN6) and SHP2 (also known as 
PTPN11), SRC66–68, and the lipid kinase FYVE finger-
containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKFYVE)69. 
Novel ALK targets have been identified by proteomics 
efforts, leading to a substantial list of potential players 
in ALK signalling67,70–78. This list is complemented by 
transcriptome-based approaches that have identified sev-
eral ALK-regulated genes79. Work in the neuroblastoma 
field has identified MYCN as a transcriptional target of 
activated, full-length ALK80. A number of additional 
genes transactivated in this case by NPM–ALK activity 

have also been reported, some of which have been vali-
dated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) analyses, such 
as JUNB, Y-box transcription factor (YBX1), BCL2A1, 
matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), CDKN2A and 
hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A)79–83. There are also 
reports of microRNAs involved in ALK signalling, with 
miR-135b, miR-29a and miR-16 being downstream of 
NPM–ALK, as well as miR-96-mediated regulation  
of ALK expression84–87.

The signalling pathways used by the different ALK 
fusion proteins and the full-length activated receptor 
share common components, but given the variable cel-
lular contexts, a number of differences can be expected 
on the basis of tumour type and, when applicable, on 
the identity of the ALK fusion partner. It is clear that 
many questions about activated ALK signalling remain 
to be answered, not only for the numerous ALK fusion 
proteins but also for the wild-type and mutant versions 
of ALK. Issues that are important to address for future 
therapeutic treatments include identifying the ALK

in cancer.

ALK alterations in human cancer
Translocations involving the ALK locus. For reasons that 
are not well understood, ALK seems to be a ‘hotspot’ for 
translocation to a wide variety of loci. The list of translo-
cations involving ALK has lengthened considerably since 
the original discovery of NPM–ALK in ALCL1. The vari-
ous translocations lead to the production of ALK fusion 
proteins that dimerize to constitutively activate ALK. 
Such ALK fusions function as oncogenic drivers in the 
progression of both haematopoietic malignancies and 
solid tumours6,59 (FIG. 1). ALK fusions have been reported 
in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT), non-
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (FIG. 1).

So far, 22 different genes have been described as being 
translocated with ALK and, to add to the complexity, 
within the different ALK fusions there are examples of 
several breakpoint variants, as illustrated by the EML4–
ALK translocations observed in NSCLC, by which mul-
tiple EML4 exon breakpoints fuse in-frame with exon 
20 of ALK88. In ALCL, which mostly affects children and 
young adults, the most well-studied ALK translocation 
product is NPM–ALK, which occurs in up to 80% of 
cases1,89–91. However, ALK has many translocation part-
ners in ALCL, such as ring finger protein 213 (RNF213; 
also known as ALO17)92, ATIC92–94, TRK-fused gene 
(TFG)95,96, moesin (MSN)97, tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) and 
TPM4 (REFS 98–100), myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9)101, 
and clathrin heavy chain (CLTC)102 (FIG. 1).

IMT, which mostly occurs in young patients, was 
the  first  solid  tumour  to  be  associated  with  ALK 
translocation103. As with ALCL, ALK fusions in IMT 
involve a number of different partners, such as TPM3, 
TPM4 (REF. 104), CLTC105,106, cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 

(CARS)107, ATIC108, SEC31A109, PTPRF-interacting 
protein-binding protein 1 (PPFIBP1)110 and RAN-
binding protein 2 (RANBP2)111 (FIG. 1). Indeed, up to 50% 
of IMT cases contain an ALK rearrangement. Of note, in 
ALCL and IMT, the presence of ALK translocations is 
associated with a better prognosis91,112–116.

By contrast, ALK-translocation-positive DLBCL, 
which is a rare B cell lymphoma, is correlated with 
aggressive disease progression117–121, and this patient 
group might benefit from individually tailored thera-
peutic approaches that target ALK. The most frequent 
chromosomal rearrangement of ALK in DLBCL is 
the t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation, which generates 
CLTC–ALK122. Other ALK fusions reported in DLBCL 
are NPM–ALK, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)–ALK and 
SEC31A–ALK123–126.

Although the proportion of patients with NSCLC 
harbouring ALK fusions is smaller than occurs in, for 
example, ALCL or IMT, the higher worldwide inci-
dence of lung cancer, with 1.4 million deaths per year, 
means that NSCLC contributes by far the largest ALK-
fusion-positive patient population127. The US National 
Cancer Institute’s Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium, 
among others, reports ALK translocations in around 
4% of NSCLC cases128,129. The EML4–ALK fusion is the 
most common translocation in NSCLC and was simul-
taneously identified in two very different experimental 
approaches130,131. Rikova et al.130 used one of the first 
global phosphotyrosine proteomic analyses of NSCLC 
cells and identified two ALK fusion proteins: EML4–
ALK and TFG–ALK. In a more classical approach, 
Soda et al.131 used a retroviral cDNA expression library 
from a lung adenocarcinoma specimen. Other ALK 
translocations have also been described in NSCLC that 
arise much less frequently than EML4–ALK — namely, 
kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B)–ALK, kinesin 
light chain 1 (KLC1)–ALK, and protein tyrosine phos-
phatase non-receptor type 3 (PTPN3)–ALK and striatin 
(STRN)–ALK132–135.

Figure 3 | Understanding activating ALK mutations at the molecular level.  a | The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
domain structure is shown. The extracellular domain of ALK contains two MAM domains (shown in pink), one LDLa domain 
(beige) and a glycine-rich extracellular domain (G-rich; blue). A single transmembrane (TM) domain is situated between 
the extracellular and intracellular portions (green), and the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain is shown in 
purple. S.S is the signal sequence. The ribbon diagram of the kinase domain of ALK shows the G-rich loop (1,123–1,128; 
brown), the αC helix (1,157–1,173; dark green), the catalytic loop (1,246–1,251; grey), DFG motif (lime green) and the 
activation loop (1,271–1,288; blue). The structure shown is of residues 1,093–1,400 of the ALK intracellular domain bound 
to ADP (orange)200,201. The regulatory spine of ALK, including I1171, C1182, F1271 and H1247, is shown in cyan200,207. 
Structural data are not available for residues 1,062, 1,087 and 1,091. The figure was generated with PyMol using published 
coordinates (Protein Data Bank code: 3LCS). b | Schematic diagram indicating protein structure and boundaries for 
certain domains of ALK, such as the extracellular domain (19–1,038), the transmembrane domain (1,039–1,060; green), the 
G-rich loop (1,123–1,128; blue), the αC helix (1,157–1,173; turquoise), the catalytic loop (1,246–1,251; beige) and the 
activation loop (1,271–1,288; dark blue). Numbers above the schematic diagram indicate verified ligand-independent 
mutations (pale green), ligand-dependent mutations (dark green) and kinase-dead mutations (brown) in neuroblastomas. 
Mutations discovered or acquired owing to crizotinib treatment found in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours are depicted in yellow. c | The three classes of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma are 
shown. Biochemical analysis, cell culture and in vivo genetic model systems have been used to classify the different ALK 
mutations found in patients into three classes: gain-of-function ligand-independent mutations, ligand-dependent 
mutations and kinase-dead mutations. Scanning electron microscope images of eyes from Drosophila melanogaster 
expressing different ALK mutations are shown.

ment pre-crizotinib treatment was not a favourable 
prognostic factor in NSCLC136. Currently, patients with 
NSCLC are examined for a number of well-defined 
molecular subtypes; patients harbouring the EML4–
ALK fusion are regarded as one adenocarcinoma 
subgroup, and this population is typically younger 
than the average patient with lung cancer, is never- or 
non-smoking and is wild type for epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS137,138. Since the 
initial reports of ALK inhibitors as an effective treat-
ment option20, the latest report of ongoing Phase III 
trials indicates a better performance of crizotinib 
over standard chemotherapy in patients with previ-
ously treated, advanced ALK-translocation-positive 
NSCLC139.

Other ALK-translocation-positive malignancies 
include RCC, colon carcinoma, breast cancer, ovar-
ian cancer and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC). ALK translocations with TPM3, vinculin 
(VCL) and EML4 have been identified in RCCs140,141. 
However, in a recent investigation of 534 adult patients 
with RCC, only two ALK rearrangements were iden-
tified, both with a poor outcome142. Thus, ALK rear-
rangements seem to be uncommon events in RCC. 
ALK rearrangements with EML4 and C2orf44 have also 
been observed in colon carcinomas, and EML4–ALK 
has been reported in breast cancer143,144. Recent char-
acterization of primary ovarian tumour tissues identi-
fied a novel ALK fusion: fibronectin 1 (FN1)–ALK in 
patients with serous ovarian carcinoma145. Similarly, 
a low frequency of ALK translocation, in this case 
TPM4–ALK, has been described in ESCC146,147.

Despite the variety of ALK fusion partners, some 
general features can be noted. First, the initiation of 
the transcription of ALK fusion proteins is driven by 
the regulatory regions of the partner gene. Second, the 
subcellular localization of the fusion protein is deter-
mined by the partner protein, which means that ALK 
activity can occur in the nucleus and/or in the cyto-
plasm. Finally, the dimerization of ALK fusions occurs 
through the ALK partner protein and involves trans-
autophosphorylation, and thus activation of the ALK 
kinase domain (FIG. 2).

It is likely that more ALK-translocation-positive 
subpopulations of other cancer types will be identified 
in the future. This suggests a scenario in which ALK 
fusions will be expressed in many cancers, although 
only in a small proportion of patients of any given can-
cer type. Whether all ALK fusion proteins are equally 
potent is unclear. Expression levels, the tissues in 
which the ALK translocations occur and the unique 
signalling properties of the individual ALK fusions all 
contribute to the final oncogenic outcome. Although 
not well understood, differences have been reported 
between a number of ALK fusion proteins with regard 
to proliferation rate, colony formation, invasion and 
tumorigenicity owing to activation of various signalling 
pathways58. Moreover, how do we relate the differences 
we observe in cells growing in vitro to the context of the 
patient tumour and its surrounding stroma?

R E V I E W S

Overexpression of ALK. Amplification of the ALK locus 
and overexpression of ALK protein has been reported in 
many different types of cancer cell lines and in human 
tumour samples148–155 (FIG. 1), but there is little informa-
tion addressing the importance of these events in the 
initiation or progression of disease. However, in neu-
roblastoma, amplification of chromosome 2 — which 
encodes both MYCN and ALK — is of particular note 
given the documented role of ALK and MYCN in driv-
ing neuroblastoma and recent results suggesting that 
they may cooperate in neuroblastoma progression156,157. 
In some cases of neuroblastoma, amplification is accom-
panied by mutation (discussed below), correlating with 
poor prognosis156.

Mutations of ALK. With the approval of crizotinib it has 
become more important to accurately define the func-
tional effect of ALK mutants in the hope that appro-
priate treatment protocols can be used for tumours in 
which ALK is activated by mutation, as well as for those 
that arise in ALK translocations. In addition, a better 
understanding of the various ALK mutations should 
aid in revealing the mechanisms by which ALK is acti-
vated. Activating point mutations and small deletions 
in ALK have been described in neuroblastoma, thyroid 
cancer and NSCLC, as well as in crizotinib-resistant 
ALK translocations in NSCLC and IMT158–163. Genetic 
investigations underscore the role of ALK in tumorigen-
esis, with several groups identifying point mutations in 
ALK in both familial and sporadic neuroblastoma48–52. 
We focus below on activating ALK mutations in neuro-
blastoma, a childhood cancer that is considered to be a 
disease of the developing sympathetic nervous system 
because it originates from precursor cells of neural crest 
tissue that are normally only active during embryonic 
development164. Investigation of full-length ALK as an 
oncogene in neuroblastoma should allow us to begin 
to understand the role of this receptor in the subset of 
tumours expressing full-length, mutated ALK, as well 
as during developmental processes.

In the case of ALK fusion proteins, the resultant 
aberrant ALK activity is dictated by the fusion partner. 
This is in contrast to ALK mutations, which affect ALK-
expressing tissues and presumably perturb physiologi-
cal ALK signalling processes. Gain-of-function ALK 
mutations are observed in a substantial number of cases 
of familial neuroblastoma, as well as in sporadic cases, 
with two hotspot mutations occurring in the kinase 
domain: F1174 (mutated to L, S, I, C or V) and R1275 
(mutated to Q or L and resulting in a loss of the basic 
side chain). These hotspot mutations are observed in 
around 85% of cases with mutant ALK48–52,156. Most of 
the ALK mutations described are located within the 
kinase domain and several — K1062M, F1174L and 
R1275Q — have been shown to behave in an oncogenic 
manner in mice and cell culture models49,50 (BOX 1; FIG. 2; 
TABLE 2). For many of the ALK mutations described in 
neuroblastoma, the assumption of gain of function has 
been based on structural predictions52 (BOX 1). Although 
biochemical examination of ALK mutants in neuro-
blastoma cell lines is complex owing to their variable

genetic backgrounds, such studies have been comple-
mented by analyses in additional model systems. So far, 
the accumulated data from such analyses suggest that 
the different cancer-associated ALK mutations fall into 
three classes (FIG. 2c). The first class is gain-of-function 
ligand-independent mutations (such as F1174I, F1174S 

and F1174L49,50,53,54,165) and the second class is ligand-
dependent mutations that are not constitutively active 
and require activation with agonist antibodies53 (such 
as D1091N, T1151M and A1234T) (FIG. 2c; TABLE 2). The 
importance of these mutations, and whether they repre-
sent passenger or driver mutations in neuroblastoma, is

Comparison	of	the	anaplastic	lymphoma	kinase	(ALK)	mutations	found	in	neuroblastoma	with	the	secondary	crizotinib-
resistant	mutations	reported	in	non-small-cell	lung	cancer	(NSCLC)	and	inflammatory	myofibroblastic	tumour	(IMT)	
highlights	some	interesting	features	(see	the	figure).	Although	the	crizotinib-resistant	ALK	mutations	generally	cluster	
around	the	inhibitor	and	ATP-binding	site,	strongly	activating	neuroblastoma-associated	ALK	mutations	occur	nearby	or	
around	the	putative	residues	that	are	important	for	initial	activation	of	ALK	(in	the	α-helix	of	the	activation	loop	and	in	the	
αC helix),	thereby	aiding	activation.	One	exception	is	the	F1174	mutation,	which	is	a	hotspot	mutation	in	neuroblastoma	
and	has	also	been	observed	as	a	crizotinib-resistant	mutation	in	a	patient	with	IMT	harbouring	a	RAN-binding	protein	2	
(RANBP2)–ALK	translocation52,163.	Neuroblastoma-associated	mutations	that	confer	strong	ALK	activation	in	in vitro	assays	
include:	G1128A,	F1174L,	F1174I,	F1174S,	R1192Q,	F1245C	and	Y1278S,	whereas	the	mutations	M1166R,	I1171N	and	
R1275Q	function	as	driver	mutations	in vitro	but	are	unable	to	transform	Ba/F3	cells49,50,53,54,165,168.	From	the	crystal	structure,	
residues	M1166,	R1275	and	Y1278	cluster	together	in	the	interface	between	the	αC helix	and	the	DFG	activation	loop,	
which	forms	a	short	α-helix	that	packs	against	the	αC helix	in	the	inactivated	form	of	ALK200,201.	A	recent	crystal	structure	
of	the	R1275Q	mutation	shows	a	destabilized	DFG	helix,	which	might	indicate	a	conformational	change	from	an	inactive	
to	an	active	form205.	Biochemical	analysis	of	the	nucleophosmin	(NPM)–ALK	fusion	has	defined	Y1278	as	the	first	tyrosine	to	
be	phosphorylated	in	the	YRASYY	sequence	that	is	present	in	the	activation	loop	of	the	kinase	domain206.	Mutation	of	this	
residue	in	neuroblastoma	is	mechanistically	intriguing,	and	it	will	be	interesting	to	know	whether	the	Y1278S	mutant	is	
phosphorylated.	In	the	structure	of	the	R1275Q	mutation,	although	still	unphosphorylated,	the	hydrogen	bond	between	
the	hydroxyl-group	of	Y1278	and	the	backbone	nitrogen	of	C1097	is	lost,	providing	a	structural	rationale	for	the	activating	
effect	of	the	R1275Q	mutation200,201,205.	The	activating	mutations	F1174L,	F1174I,	F1174S	(in	the	αC	helix)	and	F1245C	(at	
the	end	of	the	αE	helix),	together	with	F1098	(next	to	the	C1097-Y1278	hydrogen	bond)	and	F1271	(in	the	DFG	motif)	form	
a	hydrophobic	cluster	that	is	thought	to	regulate	the	activation	process200,201.	Such	structural	changes	are	thought	to	
underlie	the	observed	increased	ATP-binding	affinity	of	the	ALK-F1174L	mutation168.	This	hypothesis	has	yet	to	be	
confirmed,	because	a	recent	structure	of	the	F1174L	mutation	did	not	show	a	structural	alteration	of	this	region	compared	
with	wild	type205.	Although	no	crystal	structure	exists	of	the	F1245C	mutation,	it	is	thought	that	the	hydrophobic	
interactions	are	disrupted,	allowing	the	αC	helix	to	rotate	more	freely.

A	crystal	structure	for	ALK	in	phosphorylated	mode	would	substantially	contribute	to	our	understanding	of	the	activation	

process	and	might	highlight	the	importance	of	the	I1171N	mutation,	which	is	located	in	the	αC helix	and	is	one	of	the	four	
residues	(I1171,	C1182,	F1271	and	H1247)	that	make	up	the	regulatory	spine	of	ALK200,207.	Currently,	we	can	only	speculate	
that	the	I1171N	mutation	might	activate	ALK	by	locking	the	regulatory	spine	in	an	active	conformation.

Glycine-rich	loops	are	present	in	all	canonical	protein	kinases.	During	catalysis	they	function	as	a	clamp	covering	the	
β-	and	γ-phosphates	of	ATP,	and	they	have	an	important	role	in	controlling	nucleotide	affinity	and	the	phosphoryl	transfer	
rate208.	The	G1128A	neuroblastoma-associated	mutation	is	situated	in	the	glycine-rich	loop	(GxGxxG/A)	and	generates	a	
gain-of-function	kinase,	the	activity	of	which	can	be	abrogated	by	ALK	inhibitors54.	Although	the	mechanism	of	activation	
is	not	clear,	this	mutation	presumably	alters	the	interaction	of	the	kinase	with	ATP	in	a	manner	favouring	increased	
phosphate	transfer.	Finally,	R1192	normally	connects	to	the	αC helix	with	a	salt	bridge,	thus	the	R1192Q	mutation	may	
offer	less	steric	hindrance	to	the	αC helix,	which	might	assume	a	more	kinase-active	position.

The	figure	compares	mutations	observed	in	patients	with	neuroblastoma	with	those	found	in	patients	with	crizotinib-

resistant	NSCLC	and	IMT.	In	part	a	of	the	figure,	the	crizotinib-resistant	ALK	mutations	from	patients	with	NSCLC	and	IMT	
are	shown	in	the	ALK	kinase	domain	(yellow	balls	represent	mutated	residues;	T1151ins	indicates	an	insertion	mutation).	
Part	b	of	the	figure	shows	verified	gain-of-function	mutations	found	in	patients	with	neuroblastoma	(red	balls	represent	
mutated	residues).	Also	indicated	are	the	glycine-rich	loop	(shown	in	brown),	the	αC helix	(dark	green),	the	catalytic	loop	
(grey),	the	activation	loop	(blue)	and	the	DFG	motif	(green).	The	figure	was	generated	with	PyMol	using	published

dead, but this so far only includes the I1250T muta-
tion, which has been found in two patients166. Although 
kinase-dead ALK may be unable to signal itself, it is not 
clear whether this mutant is able to affect signalling 
through the wild-type copy of ALK in tumours. This 
is important to consider given our current understand-
ing of kinase-dead BRAF, which displays cooperative  
tumorigenicity with oncogenic RAS167.

The cataloguing of the activation status of the dif-
ferent ALK mutations is complex because certain 
mutants (in particular ALK-M1166R, ALK-I1171N 
and ALK-R1275Q) are able to differentiate PC12 cells, 
transform NIH3T3 cells and disrupt development in the 
D. melanogaster eye (causing a rough-eye phenotype), but 
are unable to transform Ba/F3 cells53,54,168. Such results 
suggest that we would be naive to rely on a single system 
to ascertain the oncogenic potential of ALK mutations 
and that using multiple systems should increase our 
understanding. How we then integrate this information 
into the complex genetic landscape of tumour develop-
ment in vivo is an even greater challenge for the future. 
Although transgenic mouse models of ALK mutants 
have recently been reported to drive neuroblastoma 
formation with MYCN (discussed below), knock in of 
an activating mutant in the ALK locus has not yet been 
reported and may offer important insights in vivo.

Finally, it is important to remember that, in the dif-
ferent model systems, the activity of all neuroblastoma 
ALK mutations tested thus far can be abrogated by 
treatment with ALK small molecule inhibitors, such 
as NVP-TAE 684 and crizotinib, albeit with differing 
sensitivity53,54,168,169.

ALK cooperation with other oncogenes: MYCN 
Does ALK initiate tumour development? Although ALK 
fusion proteins seem to function as tumour initiators and 
are involved in the progression of many cancer types, the 
case for ALK activation as a driver in tumours lacking 
ALK translocations, of which neuroblastoma is currently 
the most well studied, is not clearcut. Neuroblastoma is 
heterogeneous and exhibits a number of chromosomal 
irregularities, such as deletions of regions of chromo-
somes 1p and 11q, gain of parts of 17q, triploidy and 
frequent amplification of MYCN, which is a prognostic 
indicator156,170. Because both ALK and MYCN are located 
in close proximity to each other on chromosome 2p, 
amplification of MYCN can also involve amplification 
of the ALK locus. For patients with neuroblastoma with 
MYCN amplification, ALK mutation has been reported 
to be associated with an unfavourable aggressive neuro-
blastoma phenotype49–52,154,156,157,171–174. When expressed 
together, ALK and MYCN promote NIH3T3 cell trans-
formation and both wild-type and activated mutant 
forms of ALK stimulate transcription of MYCN80. RTKs, 
such as ALK, activate both ERK and PI3K on ligand stim-
ulation or as a result of an activating mutation175,176. Such 
activity has been suggested to stabilize MYCN177, which is 
normally degraded during mitosis in response to low lev-
els of PI3K activity, and persistent high levels of MYCN 
drive neuroblastoma oncogenesis178. The connection

between ALK and MYCN has been further explored in 
transgenic zebrafish and mouse models. In zebrafish, 
human ALK-F1174L alone does not lead to tumour 
development; however, the induction of interrenal gland 
tumours (similar to human neuroblastoma) was signifi-
cantly increased in the presence of both ALK-F1174L and 
MYCN55,179. Similar results have been observed in mice, 
in which ALK-F1174L potentiates the oncogenic activ-
ity of MYCN in a neuroblastoma mouse model, induc-
ing an earlier onset, higher penetrance and increased 
lethality180. Furthermore, expression of ALK-F1174L 
increases the endogenous expression of MYCN, owing 
to increased stabilization and upregulation of endog-
enous MYCN mRNA180. An independent transgenic 
mouse model in which ALK-F1174L is expressed in the 
neural crest results in tumour development, suggesting 
that activated ALK drives tumorigenesis181. In agreement 
with Berry et al.180, expression of both ALK-F1174L and 
MYCN synergized to accelerate neuroblastoma develop-
ment181. The current models have made important initial 
contributions to our understanding of tumour develop-
ment in neuroblastoma, but can they be improved? Our 
understanding of neuroblastoma initiation and progres-
sion would be aided by the generation of knock-in ALK 
mutants or, as Heukamp and co-authors181 suggest, by 
using a tamoxifen-dependent Cre model that allows ALK 
activation at different developmental time points.

ALK mutations in transgenic mouse models may 
provoke a cancer initiation event that requires a sec-
ond hit, such as activation of MYCN or other genomic 
aberrations, which occur over time to promote trans-
formation182. Indeed, ALK may cooperate with other 
oncogenes or in the background of loss of tumour sup-
pressor genes. For example, there is evidence from stud-
ies in D. melanogaster for interaction between ALK and 
neurofibromin 1 (NF1), a known tumour suppressor in 
neuroblastoma43,183. In human neuroblastoma there are 
a number of commonly observed chromosome aberra-
tions for which the importance for progression at the 
molecular level is unclear, such as those on chromo-
somes 1p, 11q and 17q170. The challenge for the future 
will be to decipher patterns and define key events in the 
development of tumours expressing non-translocated 
ALK mutants, perhaps in the manner of the ‘Vogelgrams’ 
in colon carcinoma184,185.

Treatment of ALK-positive tumours
In 2011, crizotinib and the companion ALK break-apart 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe kit were 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)16. Break-apart FISH is the currently recommended 
methodology for the identification of ALK transloca-
tions in NSCLC; however, it is costly, experimentally 
demanding and not foolproof, and more robust screening 
methods for ALK aberrations, including PCR, immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing, 
are being actively explored186. Further investigations and 
the development of antibodies with improved sensitivity 
and specificity are necessary for the effective identifica-
tion of patients with ALK-positive tumours in cancer 
types in which ALK fusion proteins prove difficult to

detect. This can be compared with tumour types in 
which the expression of ALK fusion proteins is high, 
such as ALCL, for which screening of ALK translocation 
is already routine187. In addition to considering initial 
diagnostics, the importance of tumour re-biopsy and 
examination for ALK lesions during disease progression 
also needs to be considered. This is important given the 
emergence of resistance mutations in ALK fusion onco-
genes in patients treated with crizotinib159,188, as well as 
the emergence of activating ALK mutations later in the 
disease course of one patient with neuroblastoma that 
was wild-type for ALK on initial diagnosis165.

It is now clear that the usefulness of long-term crizo-
tinib treatment, as with other TKIs, is limited owing to 
the development of drug resistance (discussed below). 
Acquired mutations in ALK that confer crizotinib 
resistance are a serious complication in the treatment of 
cancer patients, which may be overcome by the develop-
ment of more effective drugs, as well as by combination 
therapy strategies189. Future approaches should be aided 
by improved and ever-cheaper genome technologies, 
such as whole-exome, whole-genome and transcriptome 
sequencing170,190. Our current knowledge already paints a 
complex picture of individual cancers, highlighting not 
only potential initiating (driver) mutations but also pro-
gression mechanisms that may be exploited in treatment 
regimens. The challenge is to interpret this information 

and apply combination therapies that are tailored to the 
genomic landscape of the individual tumour. Currently, 
several ongoing clinical trials address combinatorial 
treatments for ALK-positive tumours, including one 
examining the use of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) 
inhibitors together with either of the ALK TKIs crizo-
tinib or LDK378 for NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fiers: NCT01712217, NCT01121575, NCT01579994 and 
NCT01772797). The use of HSP90 inhibitors is moti-
vated by the knowledge that ALK is an HSP90 client 
and HSP90 antagonists have been reported to disrupt 
the ALK fusion protein–HSP90 complex, leading to the 
degradation of the ALK fusion protein191–194. Studies in 
patients with NSCLC suggest that HSP90 inhibitors have 
clinical activity in patients carrying ALK translocations 
in particular195. HSP90 inhibitors (in combination with 
ALK inhibition) have also been reported to block the 
activity of crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants169. Work 
in mice suggests that other combinations with ALK 
TKIs may be worthy of future exploration in patients; 
for example, mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be 
effective in a mouse model of ALK- and MYCN-driven 
neuroblastoma180. However, one important issue under-
lying the development of combination therapies is the 
fact that different drugs originate from different com-
panies, therefore more focus on coordinating efforts 
rather than on profit margins is required for longer term

Gatekeeper mutations
Mutations of crucial amino acid 
side chains in many kinases 
that determine the relative 
accessibility of the 
hydrophobic inhibitor-binding 
pocket, which is located 
adjacent to the ATP-binding 
site. The gatekeeper residue 
does not usually interact with 
ATP, thus its mutation does not 
affect the catalytic activity of 
the enzyme but most 
commonly interferes with the 
ability of the small-molecule 
inhibitor to bind effectively to 
the enzyme, thus conferring 
inhibitor resistance.

patient benefits. Other important considerations with 
combination strategies are toxicity and the difficulty in 
achieving therapeutic target inhibition when two drugs 
are given in combination.

Given that crizotinib has fairly modest adverse effects 
and that ALK does not seem to have an obvious role in 
mouse development, treatment of young patients with 
ALK-associated tumours may be viable. Indeed, the 
results of ongoing paediatric trials from the Children’s 
Oncology Group show that crizotinib is well tolerated 
and may be an effective therapeutic treatment strategy 
for some children with certain categories of ALK-positive 
tumours, particularly those with ALK-positive ALCL, 
IMT and NSCLC196. The story becomes more complex in 
ALK-positive neuroblastoma, for which treatment with 
crizotinib shows variable responses, possibly reflecting 
the heterogeneous nature of neuroblastoma in terms of 
chromosomal irregularities170. In such cases, combina-
tion of ALK inhibitors with other inhibitors might be an 
option in the future, with the challenge being to distin-
guish relevant subsets of patients with neuroblastoma for 
such individualized therapeutic treatment196.

ALK and resistance mechanisms. Initial reports of the 
promising therapeutic potential of ALK TKIs for the 
treatment of ALK-positive patients with NSCLC was 
accompanied by the identification of crizotinib-induced 
secondary mutations — C1156Y and L1196M — in the 
ALK kinase domain159,188 (BOX 1). The L1196M mutation 
is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations EGFR-T790M 
and ABL1-T315I, as ALK-L1196M interferes with 
crizotinib binding through steric hindrance159 and, in 
comparison to EGFR-T790M, allows continued ALK 
activation in the presence of crizotinib197. The mecha-
nism by which other secondary ALK mutations, such as 
C1156Y159, L1152R and the insertion mutation T1151ins 
(REFS 169,198), lead to the activation of ALK in the pres-
ence of an ALK TKI is still unclear. Because no struc-
ture is currently available for active ALK, it is difficult to 
project the conformational disturbance that presumably 
results from these secondary mutations. Interestingly, 
ALK is also mutated in this region in neuroblastoma, 
and ALK-T1151M has been shown to behave as a 
ligand-dependent receptor in a manner that is com-
parable to wild-type ALK53. This suggests that similar 
mutations, in the context of ALK fusion oncogenes, do 
not activate the kinase per se, but rather subtly alter the 
affinity of the kinase domain for crizotinib and thus 
confer resistance.

The ALK-G1269A mutation has been reported in 
two patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC199. The 
location of the G1269A mutation (in the DFG -1 posi-
tion of the activation segment of the kinase domain) 
is crucially situated for ATP or crizotinib binding 
and might reduce crizotinib binding owing to steric 
hindrance or by increasing the affinity for ATP at the 
expense of the affinity for crizotinib, in a similar manner 
to the L1196M mutation197. Indeed, G1269 is an impor-
tant residue in ALK that contributes to the ATP-binding 
cavity, thereby reducing access to V1180 at the back of 
the ATP pocket200,201.

Other ALK mutations that are relevant to crizotinib 
response include G1202R and S1206Y, which occur in 
the EML4–ALK fusion protein and which were identified 
in patients with NSCLC169. Interestingly, ALK-G1202R 
is analogous to the experimentally induced BCR–ABL 
mutation G340W and might represent a similar mecha-
nism of activation202. The L1198F, G1201E, G1202R and 
S1206Y mutations are positioned in the ALK kinase 
domain adjacent to the crizotinib- and ATP-binding site 
and are thought to decrease the affinity of mutant ALK 
for crizotinib. Several of these mutations confer a high 
level of resistance to crizotinib160,169. Also important to 
note are two ALK mutations at functionally intriguing 
positions reported in anaplastic thyroid cancer: L1198F 
and G1201E (rather than the F1174 and R1275 hotspot 
mutations in neuroblastoma)160 (BOX 1).

There are additional alternative methods of overcom-
ing ALK inhibition. These include ALK amplification, 
aberrant amplification of KIT, and mutation of KRAS 
and EGFR, which have all been identified in patient 
samples169,199. These alterations bypass the requirement 
for ALK activity in the tumour cells. Thus, crizotinib 
resistance is a complex affair that includes ALK kinase 
domain mutations, copy number gain of ALK fusions 
and ALK, and other oncogenes.

Conclusions and perspectives
The evidence linking ALK to various human cancer 
types is now well accepted, and exciting developments 
in ALK research in recent years hold promise for the 
treatment of ALK-positive patients. However, the accu-
mulated results of patients treated with crizotinib paint 
a picture of tumour resistance in response to this tar-
geted therapy, leaving important issues for the research 
community to resolve. It remains to be seen whether the 
lessons learned from the study of tumours expressing 
ALK fusion oncoproteins are similar to those of tumours 
expressing point mutations. Indeed, in tumours in which 
full-length ALK is overexpressed, questions such as 
the identity and potential role of ALK ligands become 
important. Efforts in a number of model systems will 
hopefully address these issues in the future.

Although most available data about targeting ALK 
concern crizotinib, the new generation of drugs, includ-
ing LDK378 (an ALK inhibitor), 3–39 (an ALK inhibitor), 
AP26113 (a dual EGFR and ALK inhibitor), CH5424802 
(an ALK inhibitor), ASP3026 (an ALK inhibitor), X-396 
(an ALK inhibitor) and IPI504 (an HSP90 inhibitor), 
all offer potential therapeutic options for ALK-positive 
tumours136,189. In the case of tumours in which activated 
ALK is mutated without truncating the protein, such as 
in neuroblastoma, the use of ALK inhibitory antibodies is 
also being actively explored as a therapeutic option13,203,204. 
An additional approach that is being explored for the 
treatment of ALK-positive tumours is vaccination with 
ALK oncoantigens149. Time will tell how well these prom-
ising approaches will be integrated into clinical reality. To 
do this effectively, skilled translational teams will need 
to process tumours and identify mutations, copy number 
changes, translocations and aberrant gene expression to 
allow effective individual cancer treatment.
