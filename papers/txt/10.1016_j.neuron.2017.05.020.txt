SUMMARY

Ventral midbrain dopamine (DA) is unambiguously
involved in motivation and behavioral arousal, yet
the contributions of other DA populations to these
processes are poorly understood. Here, we demon-
strate that the dorsal raphe nucleus DA neurons are
critical modulators of behavioral arousal and sleep-
wake patterning. Using simultaneous ﬁber photom-
etry and polysomnography, we observed time-delin-
eated dorsal raphe nucleus dopaminergic (DRNDA)
activity upon exposure to arousal-evoking salient
cues, irrespective of their hedonic valence. We also
observed broader ﬂuctuations of DRNDA activity
across sleep-wake cycles with highest activity dur-
ing wakefulness. Both endogenous DRNDA activity
and optogenetically driven DRNDA activity were
associated with waking from sleep, with DA signal
strength predictive of wake duration. Conversely,
chemogenetic inhibition opposed wakefulness and
promoted NREM sleep, even in the face of salient
stimuli. Therefore, the DRNDA population is a critical
contributor to wake-promoting pathways and is
capable of modulating sleep-wake states according
to the outside environment, wherein the perception
of salient stimuli prompts vigilance and arousal.

INTRODUCTION

In mammals, behavioral arousal ﬂuctuates as inputs are received
from both the external environment (e.g., food availability, pred-
ator threat) and internal milieu (e.g., hunger, mating drive, ho-
meostatic sleep demand)
(Garey et al., 2003; Brown et al.,
2012). While the neural circuits that encode these individual stim-
uli can be highly stimulus speciﬁc or tuned to a speciﬁc valence
(positive or negative), their activation often promotes more gen-
eral effects on arousal and electrocortical wakefulness through
diverse wake-promoting neurons (Aston-Jones and Bloom,
1981; Szymusiak and McGinty, 2008). Akin to how the noradren-
ergic (NA) neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) regulate circadian

sleep-wake cycling (Takahashi et al., 2010) and promote vigi-
lance during wake (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981), multiple
neural circuits play roles in electrocortical wakefulness and
behavioral arousal to motivationally relevant situations, including
cholinergic neurons of the pons and basal forebrain (Jones,
1991; Xu et al., 2015; Pinto et al., 2013), the corticotrophin-
releasing hormone (CRH) and hypocretin (orexin) neuropeptide
systems (Sakurai et al., 1998; Winsky-Sommerer et al., 2005),
and the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system (Eban-Rothschild
et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2016).

Several

(Wisor et al., 2001)

lines of basic research and clinical observations
converge upon DA as a crucial modulator of wake drive, but
the neuroanatomical underpinnings have resisted detailed char-
acterization. For example, persistent elevation of DA tone via
pharmacology (i.e., amphetamine [Daberkow et al., 2013], mod-
aﬁnil [Qu et al., 2008]) or genetic ablation of the dopamine trans-
porter gene (Slc6a3)
is associated with
behavioral arousal, but these manipulations are diffuse and
brain-wide rather than localized to a certain region. Recent
work has revealed a role for ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA
neurons in electrocortical arousal and sleep-wake patterning
(Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2016), which comple-
ments its long-standing role in behavioral arousal to motivation-
ally relevant stimuli (Cohen et al., 2012; Lammel et al., 2014;
Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009). In contrast, diminished DA
signaling from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is asso-
ciated with insomnia, a major symptom in Parkinson’s disease
(Gjerstad et al., 2007). Considering the functional (Morales and
Margolis, 2017), genetic (Poulin et al., 2014), and anatomical
(Lammel et al., 2011, 2012; Margolis et al., 2008) heterogeneity
of midbrain DA neurons, distinct DA subgroups may exert
diverging effects on sleep-wake regulation.
Previously, a small population of DA neurons (1,000 cells in
rats) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN; or ‘‘A10 dc’’ or ‘‘ventral/
ventrolateral periaqueductal gray’’; herein referred to as the
DRNDA) (Hokfelt et al., 1984; Descarries et al., 1986; Dougalis
et al., 2012) was observed to be wake promoting (Lu et al.,
2006). Chemical lesion of these cells precipitated profound hy-
persomnia (20% increase in sleep), while prolonged wakeful-
ness elicited increased c-fos expression (Lu et al., 2006; but
see Le´ ger et al., 2010). Compared to other DA populations, little
is known about the natural dynamics of DRNDA cells, such as
whether their activity contributes to the valuation of external

cues and whether this valuation is predictive of the correspond-
response. Contrary to VTADA-driven reward
ing behavioral
circuits, optogenetic activation of DRNDA neurons fails to
reinforce operant responding (McDevitt et al., 2014) but instead
conveys a negative affective state and promotes social seeking
via a negative reinforcement mechanism (Matthews et al.,
2016). Given these seemingly disparate roles of DRNDA cells,
namely to promote wakefulness (Lu et al., 2006) and encode
a ‘‘loneliness-like’’ state (Matthews et al., 2016), we hypothe-
sized that DRNDA neurons may signal arousal on a more general
level, including awakening from sleep, maintenance of wakeful-
ness, and promoting arousal in response to behaviorally rele-
vant cues.

Here, we performed longitudinal monitoring of DRNDA activity
by calcium imaging via ﬁber photometry (Gunaydin et al., 2014)
and of sleep-wake states via electroencephalography (EEG)
and electromyography (EMG) recordings, in conjunction with
optogenetics and chemogenetics for reversible, spatially spe-
ciﬁc control of neural activity (Rajasethupathy et al., 2016; Urban
and Roth, 2015). We found that DRNDA neurons are wake-active,
showing higher population activity during wakefulness over
sleep states, and that endogenous DRNDA activity correlates
with state transitions and with external stimulus-driven behav-
iors. Furthermore, reversible and bi-directional manipulations
of DRNDA ﬁring support the sufﬁciency and necessity of these
neurons in promoting vigilance and arousal. Taken together,
our results provide evidence that DRNDA pathways provide a cir-
cuit
for modulating behavioral states and salience-induced
arousal in mammals.

RESULTS

DRNDA Neurons Are Activated by Arousal-Provoking
Salient Cues
To investigate the natural dynamics of DRNDA neurons during
awake-behaving states, we monitored DRNDA population activ-
ity in subjects exposed to a diverse array of salient stimuli and
environmental settings. In vivo activity of DRNDA neurons was
recorded using ﬁber photometry (Gunaydin et al., 2014), which
can measure bulk Ca2+-dependent ﬂuorescence of GCaMP6, a
genetically encoded calcium indicator (Chen et al., 2013),
through a single optical ﬁber positioned in deep brain structures
(Figures S1A, S1G, and S1H). Our photometry setup utilized a
490 nm beam to activate Ca2+-dependent GCaMP6 ﬂuores-
cence, as well as a 405 nm beam to image an isosbestic refer-
ence signal, which compensates for photo-bleaching and
movement-related artifacts (Lerner et al., 2015). For speciﬁc tar-
geting of DRNDA neurons, we stereotaxically injected an adeno-
associated virus (AAV) encoding GCaMP6f in a Cre-dependent
manner (AAV5-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6f) into the DRN of tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)::IRES-Cre mice (Figures 1A and 1B). Control
animals were injected with AAV encoding the ﬂuorescent marker
EGFP (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-EGFP). An optical ﬁber was implanted
over the DRN to acquire population ﬂuorescence emitted from
DRNDA neurons (Figures 1A and S1A). We conﬁrmed that
GCaMP6f-expressing neurons emitted dynamic ﬂuorescence
ﬂuctuations, while EGFP-expressing cells showed minimal ﬂuo-
rescence variation (Figures S1B and S1C).

1206 Neuron 94, 1205–1219, June 21, 2017

We quantiﬁed the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of GCaMP6f+ neu-
rons in the DRN of TH-Cre mice. Transfection was highly efﬁcient
(94.2%, n = 407/432 neurons). Similar to previous reports that
used the identical mouse line or others targeting TH or the
Slc6a3 promoter (Matthews et al., 2016), 74.9% (n = 407/543)
of GCaMP6f+ neurons were co-localized with TH in the DRN.
These neurons are not noradrenergic, as they lack dopamine
beta-hydroxylase, which converts dopamine to norepinephrine
(Nagatsu et al., 1979). Importantly, GCaMP6f+ or TH+ neurons
never overlapped with serotonergic neurons (Figures 1B and
S1D; Lu et al., 2006; Matthews et al., 2016), a major population
in the DRN that is hypothesized to regulate arousal states (Jou-
vet, 1999). It is possible that GCaMP6f+/TH  neurons may
express TH at a level below immunohistochemical detection limit
but sufﬁcient to drive Cre expression.

We ﬁrst tested DRNDA-GCaMP6f mice in a social

interaction
paradigm, in which physical contact with conspeciﬁcs after
social isolation has been demonstrated to activate DRNDA neu-
rons (Matthews et al., 2016). We observed the robust activation
of DRNDA neurons in single-housed male DRNDA-GCaMP6f mice
when they ﬁrst interacted with female intruders (Figures 1C
and 1D). Similar activation was observed with juvenile mice (Fig-
ure S2A; Movie S1; Matthews et al., 2016) and also when they
displayed aggressive behavior toward adult male intruders (Fig-
ure S2B). Beyond social interaction, we also observed prominent
DRNDA activity when mice consumed palatable food (Figures 1E
and 1F; Movie S2). To further characterize the valence tuning of
DRNDA cells, we also challenged DRNDA-GCaMP6f mice in assays
with negative contexts. Surprisingly, DRNDA neurons showed
phasic activation upon delivery of unexpected electric foot-
shocks (Figures 1G and 1H), air puffs (Figure S2C), or motivated
responding (mobility/struggling)
in tail suspension tests (Fig-
ure S2D) and during investigation of predator odor TMT (compo-
nent of

fox urine; Figure S2E). Furthermore,

In contrast, DRNDA activity showed minimal change when
mice interacted with novel or familiar objects (Figures 1I–1L, ﬁrst
encounters), which are less salient than social targets, food, or
aversive cues. Indeed, DRNDA activation during female interac-
tion, chocolate consumption, and footshock was signiﬁcantly
larger than that during object investigation (Figure 1M). Further-
more, the second and third bouts of female interaction and
aggressive behavior continued to provoke a signiﬁcant elevation
in DRNDA activity, whereas it remained relatively unchanged from
baseline with repeated novel object encounters, suggesting
rapid habituation toward physically salient but motivationally
neutral cues (Figures S2G–S2I).

These ﬁndings did not vary with subject social history, as
similar patterns of DRNDA activation were seen in group-housed
mice (Figures S2J–S2L). Furthermore, DRNDA neuronal activa-
tion was not correlated with locomotion, which argues against
the observed DRNDA activity resulting from the motor response
alone (Figures S2M–S2O). Taken together, these ﬁndings sug-
gest that DRNDA neurons are activated by a broad array of
arousal-provoking stimuli, paralleling animals’ heightened envi-
ronmental awareness that accompanies exposure to such moti-
vationally salient stimuli.

DRNDA Population Activity Correlates with Sleep-Wake
States
That DRNDA neurons were activated by exposure to a variety of
salient cues expands their previous description as a socio-
centric pathway (Matthews et al., 2016). It seems plausible that
DRNDA neurons convey more generalized arousal signals across
broad temporal scales, especially given that chemogenetic acti-
vation promotes analgesia (Li et al., 2016) and selective lesion
causes hypersomnia (Lu et al., 2006).

To test this hypothesis, we prepared TH-Cre mice for simulta-
neous and synchronized recording of DRNDA-GCaMP6s ﬂuores-
cence (AAV5-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6s, EGFP for control animals;
DRN optical ﬁber insertion; Figures 2A and 2B) and polysomnog-
raphy signals (implantation of EEG electrodes and EMG wires;
Figure 2A). Sleep-wake states, which were manually classiﬁed
in 5 s windows based on the visual and spectral characteristics
of the EEG/EMG signals, were correlated to ﬂuctuations in
DRNDA population activity (Figures 2C and S3A). Variations in
ﬂuorescent signal were absent in control DRNDA-EGFP mice (Fig-
ures 2D and S3B), and viral delivery of transgenes (here and in all
subsequent experiments) did not alter the basic sleep-wake
architecture (Figures S1E and S1F).

To record DRNDA activity over many episodes of distinct
sleep-wake states, we collected ﬁber photometry and EEG/
EMG across the entire light
(inactive) phase (Figure 2E).
DRNDA-GCaMP6s mice showed normal EEG spectral characteris-
tics and sleep-wake patterns, even in the presence of GCaMP6s
excitation light (Figures S3C and S3D). Over long recording
sessions, GCaMP6s bleaching was observed, but it could be
effectively removed by subtracting the linearly scaled control
signal from 405 nm excitation (Figure S3E). To examine the cor-
relation of DRNDA activity with sleep-wake states, we calculated
the area under the curve (AUC) for non-overlapping 5 s windows
of photometry data during each state as an index of the esti-
mated DRNDA population ﬁring rate (Figure 2F). AUC values
were signiﬁcantly higher during wakefulness (Figure 2G). For
further characterization, Ca2+ peak events were detected (Fig-
ure S3F), and their quantitative features were compared across
states. The peak amplitude and summed AUC values of de-
tected events were highest during wakefulness, but there was
no signiﬁcant difference in their frequency or duration across
distinct states (Figures S3G–S3J). Altogether, these results sug-
gest that DRNDA neurons are wake-active and that their activity
proﬁle correlates with arousal states.

To examine the temporal dynamics of DRNDA activity during
each state, we normalized the variable durations of sleep-wake
states to a unit-less time from 0 (onset) to 1 (offset) and accord-
ingly down-sampled the normalized photometry traces. During
wakefulness, DRNDA population ﬂuorescence peaked soon after
wake onset and gradually decreased toward wake offset (Fig-
ure 2H). Indeed, the DRNDA activity at the early 20th percentile

of a wake episode was signiﬁcantly larger than at the late 20th
percentile (Figure 2I). In contrast, DRNDA activity was continu-
ously suppressed during NREM sleep and showed minimal
variations during REM sleep (Figure 2H). We additionally veriﬁed
that wake episodes whose durations were similar to sleep epi-
sodes demonstrated similar dynamics (Figure S3K), suggesting
that the observed DRNDA wake dynamics did not originate
from photobleaching over time. In sum, the activity level of
DRNDA populations not only varies across sleep-wake states
but also shows dynamic changes within wakefulness, showing
highest activity after wake onset and gradual decrease toward
sleep onset.

Next, we examined DRNDA activity during state transitions.
DRNDA ﬂuorescence increased signiﬁcantly at NREM to wake
(Figure 3A; when wake duration >60 s). There was no signiﬁcant
ﬂuorescence change at REM-to-wake transitions (Figure 3B;
when wake duration >60 s). Conversely, DRNDA activity decreased
when animals fell asleep (Figure 3C). We also observed a gradual
increase of DRNDA activity across NREM-to-REM transitions (Fig-
ure 3D). When a brief period of wake (<15 s) intervened in transition
from REM to NREM, DRNDA activity exhibited a corresponding
decrease across the brief wake and NREM onset (Figure S3L).

Interestingly, we observed that the duration of wake episodes
varied as a function of the change in DRNDA activity across
the wake onset. The net ﬂuctuation in DRNDA ﬂuorescence
across sleep-to-wake transitions (from both NREM and REM)
was signiﬁcantly larger when mice were awake for a longer
period (‘‘long’’: >60 s) than when mice were brieﬂy awake
(‘‘short’’: <30 s; ‘‘intermediate’’: between 30 and 60 s; Figures
3E and 3F). This suggests that DRNDA activity at wake onset is
positively correlated with the duration of the following wake
episode.
In sum, these results provide correlative evidence
that endogenous DRNDA ﬁring is highest during wakefulness
and that DRNDA activity is dynamic across state transitions.

Optogenetic Activation of DRNDA Neurons Promotes
Wakefulness
To reveal a causal relationship between DRNDA activity and
wakefulness, we tested for sufﬁciency using a Cre-dependent
excitatory opsin to stimulate transduced DRNDA cells (AAV5-
Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP, EGFP for controls; polysomnography
for stage classiﬁcation; Figures 4A and 4B). ChR2-eYFP expres-
sion was limited to the DRN and caudal linear nucleus, and never
found in retrorubral ﬁeld or VTA (Figures S4N and S4O). To avoid
potential ceiling effects, we applied optogenetic stimulation to
DRNDA neurons during the light phase (Figure 4C). As endoge-
nous ﬁring characteristics of DRNDA cells are unknown (one
neuron reported by juxtacellular recording [Schweimer and Ung-
less, 2010]), we used stimulus parameters commonly adopted
for photoactivation of ventral midbrain DA neurons (Tsai et al.,
2009), which operate in phasic and tonic ﬁring modes. We

applied both phasic (a train of ten 30 Hz pulses, 10 ms pulse
width, every 5 s) and tonic (continuous 2 Hz pulses, 10 ms pulse
width) stimulation patterns (Figures 4C and S4D). These speciﬁc
parameters were designed to expose subjects to the same total
number of light pulses with distinct temporal structures. We veri-

ﬁed that DRNDA neurons were capable of faithfully following
phasic pulse trains in whole-cell patch clamp recordings
(Figure S4A).

Two minutes of phasic stimulation caused immediate transi-
tions to and maintenance of wakefulness from both NREM and

1210 Neuron 94, 1205–1219, June 21, 2017

REM sleep in DRNDA-ChR2 mice, but not in control DRNDA-EGFP
mice (Figures 4D–4F, S4B, and S4C). By contrast, 2 min of tonic
stimulation could only induce waking from REM sleep (Figures
S4D–S4G). Because phasic stimulation more reliably evoked
stage changes, we employed this paradigm in subsequent
experiments. Phasic activation was effective in inducing
immediate NREM-to-wake transitions even after 4 hr of sleep
deprivation, suggesting that DRNDA activation can promote
instantaneous arousal in face of high sleep pressure (Figure 4G).
Phasic stimulation caused a signiﬁcant change in cortical EEG in
DRNDA-ChR2, but not in control DRNDA-EGFP mice, as revealed by
spectral analysis (Figures 4H, 4I, S4H, and S4I); delta (0.5–4 Hz)
and high-frequency (40–100 Hz) EEG powers were decreased
and increased, respectively, upon DRNDA activation (Figures
4J and 4K).

We next sought to examine the effect of longer, sustained acti-
vation of DRNDA neurons on behavioral states. A 1 hr epoch of
phasic stimulation was applied 4 hr into the subject’s light phase
when sleep pressure is high. Photostimulation resulted in a net
increase in time awake relative to unstimulated epochs, due to
the extension of wake episodes (Figures 4L and 4M). Spectral
analysis revealed that delta (0.5–4 Hz) power was signiﬁcantly
diminished while high-frequency (40–100 Hz) activity was
enhanced in ChR2-expressing mice (Figures 4N–4P). This spec-
tral change from DRNDA activation could not be attributed to
increased locomotion, which can also affect cortical activity
and arousal (Vinck et al., 2015), because optogenetic manipula-
tions did not affect locomotion in either the light or dark phase
(open ﬁeld test; Figure S4L). Moreover, the sustained increase
in wakefulness from DRNDA activation was directly mediated
by DA, as systemic administration of D1 and D2 receptor antag-
onists (SCH-23390 and eticlopride, respectively, 1 mg/kg) prior
to stimulation abolished the wake-promoting effect of phasic
stimulation in DRNDA-ChR2 mice but caused no overall effect in
control mice (Figures S4J–S4K).

In sum, phasic stimulation of DRNDA neurons can affect sleep-
wake state patterning and promote arousal by inducing immedi-
ate sleep-to-wake transitions and prolonging wake duration.
DRNDA activity also causes electrocortical arousal, bi-direction-
ally modulating low- and high-frequency rhythms across both

Chemogenetic Inhibition of DRNDA Neurons Reduces
Wakefulness
To interrogate the necessity of DRNDA signaling for wake main-
tenance, we used a chemogenetic (Urban and Roth, 2015)
approach to reversibly inhibit DRNDA activity during polysomno-
graphic recordings (Figure 5A). Here, DRNDA cell recruitment via
expression of the inhibitory DREADD (AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-
mCherry; Figures 5A and 5B) rather than the analogous opsin
is not limited to light spread from optical ﬁbers, and long-term
suppression of DRNDA activity carries no potential for phototox-
icity. We conﬁrmed with ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp record-
ings that bath application of 1 mM clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)
reversibly reduced the ﬁring of hM4Di-expressing DRNDA neu-
rons via hyperpolarization but showed no effect on EGFP-posi-
tive cells in control mice (Figures S5B–S5E). We also veriﬁed
that the hM4Di vector was not anterogradely or retrogradely

transported from the DRN to other TH+ neurons (across a
4-week window; Figures S5F–S5I), some of which have been
shown to have reciprocal connections (Lu et al., 2006).

DRNDA-hM4Di and DRNDA-EGFP mice were habituated to exper-
imenter handling for three days prior to intraperitoneal injection of
saline or CNO (1 mg/kg) 3 hr into their dark (active) cycle, and
EEG/EMG recordings took place for 2 hr afterward (Figure 5C).
Compared to saline, CNO injection led to a marked reduction in
wakefulness (Figures 5D and 5E). At the group level, DRNDA inhi-
bition decreased the time spent in wakefulness and increased
NREM sleep time (Figure 5F). Speciﬁcally, CNO injection into
the DRNDA-hM4Di mice increased NREM sleep duration (Figure 5G)
but had no effect on the number of episodes of each state (Fig-
ure 5H). Importantly, saline or CNO injection into control mice
did not affect sleep-wake proportions (Figures 5F–5H). A change
was also evident in cortical EEG (Figure 5I); contrary to optoge-
netic activation, chemogenetic inhibition was associated with
increased delta (0.5–4 Hz) power (Figure 5J) and decreased
high-frequency (40–100 Hz) activity (Figure 5K) relative to vehicle
injection. To test whether CNO-induced sleep-wake states have
normal EEG architecture, we veriﬁed that the EEG spectrum in
each state after CNO injection was not distinguishable from those
after saline injection (Figures S5J–S5L). Thus, our ﬁndings indi-
cate that DRNDA neuronal activity is required for supporting
wakefulness in normal physiological conditions.

DRNDA Neuronal Activity Supports Wakefulness in the
Presence of Salient Stimuli
Since diverse salient stimuli activated DRNDA neurons (Figure 1)
and their ﬁring promoted wakefulness (Figures 4 and 5), we
asked whether DRNDA neurons are necessary for maintaining
arousal in the face of environmental salience by chemogeneti-
cally inhibiting their activity (Figure 6A). We introduced female
mouse and predator odor TMT to the subject’s home cage dur-
ing the dark cycle while monitoring behavioral states. These two
stimuli, which were shown to induce robust DRNDA activity (Fig-
ures 1C, 1D, and S2E), hold ethological relevance and are of
opposite valence. CNO injection into the DRNDA-hM4Di mice
reduced the time spent awake and promoted NREM sleep in
both assays, contrary to other conditions where mice remained
awake (Figures 6B and 6C). More broadly, DRNDA inhibition
during these assays caused a shift in cortical EEG spectra;
CNO treatment of DRNDA-hM4Di mice led to an increase in delta
(0.5–4 Hz) power and decreases in high-theta (8–12 Hz) and
high-frequency (40–100 Hz) power relative to saline condition,
which was absent in control mice (Figures 6D–6G).

We further asked if the unexpected presentation of arousing or
alerting stimuli (e.g., loud noises) during sleep could induce im-
mediate wake transitions with DRNDA ﬁring. DRNDA-GCaMP6s
mice were exposed to randomized auditory stimuli
(65 dB,
2–5 kHz, 2 Hz pulse frequency, 250 ms width, 10 s duration)
throughout their light phase while recording GCaMP6s ﬂuores-
cence and EEG/EMG signals (Figure S6A). We observed time-
locked DRNDA activity upon tone onset, which was most
prominent when subjects immediately (within 10 s) switched
from sleep to wake (Figures S6B and S6C). There was no detect-
able difference in DRNDA activity increase between NREM-
and REM-to-wake transitions (Figures S6D and S6E). To test

for a causal contribution of DRNDA activity to cued arousal, we
repeated the above experiment on mice expressing archaerho-
dopsin-3 (Arch; Mattis et al., 2011), which allows for time-locked
reversible inhibition (Figures S6F and S6G). When DRNDA neu-
rons were exposed to a continuous 20 s light pulse (532 nm,
10 mW) centered on tone delivery (70 dB), the probability of
cued waking from NREM (Figures S6H–S6K), but not from
REM sleep (Figures S6L–S6O), signiﬁcantly decreased. DRNDA
inhibition did not completely block NREM-to-wake transitions,
which suggests that multiple pathways likely work together to
sustain full arousal, including, but not limited to, noradrenergic
or cholinergic neurons (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981; Xu
et al., 2015). In sum, these data indicate that DRNDA activity is
required for maintaining salience-induced wakefulness and for
triggering cued waking from sleep.

DISCUSSION

Using simultaneous calcium imaging and polysomnography in
conjunction with optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations,
we demonstrated that DRNDA neurons respond to external
salient events of positive and negative valence, show correlative
ﬂuctuations at the population level across distinct sleep-wake
states, and promote wakefulness. Furthermore, DRNDA activity
is necessary to maintain normal levels of wakefulness and sup-
port arousal
in response to the perception of salient stimuli.
These ﬁndings support a role for wake-promoting DRNDA neu-
rons that parallels the arousal-promoting function of isolated
DA cells in invertebrates (Pimentel et al., 2016), as well as a

more expansive role for DRNDA signaling beyond promoting
social interaction via negative reinforcement (Matthews et al.,
2016) or mediating anti-nociceptive effects (Li et al., 2016).

Our photometry data demonstrate not only that social interac-
tion robustly enhances DRNDA spiking (female interaction, male
intruder; Figures 1 and S2), akin to previous ﬁndings (juvenile
interaction; Matthews et al., 2016), but also that these neurons
respond to the perception of highly salient, non-social stimuli
(Figures 1 and S2). DRNDA activation by a wide variety of
rewarding and aversive stimuli, both social and non-social,
occurred irrespective of the subject’s social history, as the stim-
ulus-evoked change in DRNDA ﬂuorescence was not inﬂuenced
by chronic separation from cage-mates (Figures S2J–S2M).
Given the subtleties in how various forms of social deprivation
(e.g., maternal separation, acute or chronic social
isolation)
can differentially alter physiology and behavior (George et al.,
2010; Whitaker et al., 2013), the extent to which a subject’s social
environment and rank causes plasticity in DRNDA neurons will
require further investigation. Based on the documented hetero-
geneity of ventral midbrain DA groups (Bromberg-Martin et al.,
2010; Morales and Margolis, 2017), it is plausible that DRNDA
cells may also be heterogeneous and individually tuned to spe-
ciﬁc classes of stimuli. For example, some DRNDA neurons
may play a general role in social engagement or may be more
susceptible to changes in social history, while other subsets
may ﬁre selectively for arousing, non-social stimuli. Since we
and Matthews et al.
(2016) used different ﬁber-placement
methods (angled versus perpendicular, respectively), we may
have sampled distinct, non-overlapping DRNDA subsets.

Matthews et al. (2016) further demonstrated that DRNDA neu-
rons signal aversion, a trend that was also corroborated, albeit
weakly, by our data (Figure S4M). This is in stark contrast with

wake-promoting VTADA neurons, whose activity supports robust
place preference and operant responding (Tsai et al., 2009;
Witten et al., 2011). That neural circuits may be involved in two

seemingly unrelated roles, valence encoding and sleep-wake
regulation, is not unique to midbrain DA groups; wake-promoting
LC NA neurons and CRH inputs also convey negative valence
(McCall et al., 2015). Considering the involvement of hypocretin
and VTADA systems in reward behavior (Espan˜ a, 2012; Wise,
2004), there may be dichotomous wake-promoting pathways
signaling positive or negative valence upon their activation.
That DRNDA neurons can simultaneously send arousal and
anti-nociceptive signals (Li et al., 2016) can be understood by
considering DRNDA connectivity with the bed nucleus of stria ter-
minalis (BNST; Figure S4Q), which is a critical regulator of pain
perception (Minami and Ide, 2015).

Compared to ventral midbrain DA counterparts (Schultz, 1997;
Ungless et al., 2004; Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009; Cohen
et al., 2012; Lerner et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016), the natural dy-
namics of DRNDA neurons are much less characterized. Due to
their relative low number and shared projection targets, DRNDA
neurons have been assumed to be functionally similar to VTADA
neurons and hence termed the dorso-caudal extension of the
VTA (A10) or A10 dc group (Hokfelt et al., 1984). Several pieces
of evidence argue against their treatment as a mere extension
of the VTA. Unlike the well-studied dorsal or lateral VTADA neu-
rons, which ﬁre bursts in response to rewarding or reward-pre-
dicting stimuli and are inhibited by punishment (Schultz, 1997;
Ungless et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016), or
the ventromedial VTADA neurons, which are selectively excited
(Brischoux et al., 2009), DRNDA neurons
by aversive stimuli
appear to be activated by any alerting or salient stimulus, regard-
less of valence (Figures 1 and S2). Also, they appear to be mini-
mally affected by physically salient but motivationally neutral
cues, such as novel or familiar objects (Figure 1). Since both
rewarding and aversive stimuli elicit arousal and motivated re-
sponding, the VTADA system may address this challenge of
dual positive (Schultz, 1997) and negative (Brischoux et al.,
2009; Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009; Zweifel et al., 2011)
valence coding in part through segregating to functionally and
electrophysiologically distinct subgroups split across anatom-
ical gradients (Brischoux et al., 2009; Bromberg-Martin et al.,
2010) or projection targets (Lammel et al., 2011). The DRNDA
population, from our observations, showed bimodal activation
at the population level, responding to both positive and negative
stimuli. Whether individual DRNDA neurons are uniformly excited
by positive and negative valence (therefore encoding salience),
or whether they are oppositely tuned and intermingled within
the DRN, will require future single-cell recording techniques.

DRNDA and VTADA populations diverge signiﬁcantly in down-
stream targets, which may help to explain their functional hetero-
geneity. Optogenetic excitation of VTADA neurons, especially
those projecting to the nucleus accumbens, supports both
appetitive conditioning and positive reinforcement behavior
(Wise, 2004; Witten et al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2014), whereas
stimulation of DRNDA neurons produces neutral or mild aversion
(Figure S4M; Matthews et al., 2016). These observations may be
indicative of differences in downstream connectivity between
these neuronal populations. Although DRNDA and VTADA neu-
rons share overlap in some of their downstream targets (e.g.,
the prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala), DA neurons
projecting to cortical and striatal regions predominantly arise

1216 Neuron 94, 1205–1219, June 21, 2017

from the VTA (Bjo¨ rklund and Dunnett, 2007). DRNDA terminals,
however, are biased toward the extended amygdala, such as
the BNST and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) (Figures
S4P–S4S; Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002). Thus, as a
major source of excitatory DA drive to the BNST and CeA
(Matthews et al., 2016), two regions known to bi-directionally
affect motivated behavior and regulate complex emotional
states (Jennings et al., 2013), DRNDA neurons are uniquely posi-
tioned to provide excitatory signals about environmental
salience and internal arousal state to downstream nuclei, which
can in turn initiate appropriate behavior, including triggering vig-
ilance or patterning sleep-wake states.

Although DA has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation by
pharmacological (Lin et al., 1992), genetic (Wisor et al., 2001),
and clinical (Lima, 2013) studies, the precise circuits mediating
such actions have been elusive. Single-unit recordings of VTADA
and SNcDA neurons have indicated that they do not change their
mean ﬁring rate across distinct sleep-wake states (Miller et al.,
1983; Dahan et al., 2007). Here, we show that DRNDA neurons
are wake-active (Figures 2 and 3), whereas VTADA neurons ex-
hibited increased burst ﬁring or Ca2+ signals during REM sleep
over wakefulness (Dahan et al., 2007; Eban-Rothschild et al.,
2016). While the role of VTADA ﬁring during REM sleep remains
elusive, optogenetic activation of VTADA neurons can promote
behavioral and electrocortical arousal (Eban-Rothschild et al.,
2016; Taylor et al., 2016). Unlike the DRNDA or VTADA popula-
tions, other DA groups appear to promote sleep rather than
wakefulness. For example, chemical lesion of the SNcDA neurons
projecting to the dorsal striatum (DS) promotes wakefulness, and
optogenetic stimulation of SNcDA terminals in the DS increases
NREM sleep (Qiu et al., 2016). Outside the midbrain, A13 zona
incerta DA neurons express c-fos after REM sleep rebound
(Le´ ger et al., 2010). Taken together, these studies indicate that
anatomically segregated DA populations may play functionally
heterogeneous or even opposing roles in regulating sleep-
wake states, and the DRNDA as well as VTADA systems represent
key arousal-promoting DA populations.

(e.g., salient stimuli)

As shown here (Figures 6 and S6), external factors can inﬂu-
ence sleep-wake patterns, and DRNDA neurons contribute to
these processes. Our ﬁndings that DRNDA activity tracks the
arousal states over broad temporal scales and that DRNDA neu-
rons respond to salient external cues position the DRNDA system
at the interface between internal (e.g., wake/sleep drive) and
external
inﬂuences in regulating sleep-
wake states. While this evolutionarily conserved trait is advanta-
geous for organism survival, its dysfunction may have negative
implications in humans, in which sleep disorders triggered by
the malfunctioning of arousal-promoting circuits represent a
highly morbid societal burden (Sanford et al., 2015). DRNDA neu-
rons are not well studied in humans, but it has been shown that
they degenerate in patients with multiple systems atrophy and
Lewy body dementia, which commonly cause excessive day-
time sleepiness (Benarroch et al., 2009). Going forward, thera-
peutic strategies targeting DRNDA activity may have utility in
the treatment of primary sleep-wake disorders and sleep/arousal
disturbances secondary to myriad neuropsychiatric diseases
(Sateia et al., 2000), including major depressive disorder, bipolar
affective disorder, and schizophrenia.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)::IRES-Cre knockin mice were obtained from the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EM::00254) and
crossed with wild-type C57BL/6N mice. We exclusively used male heterozygote mice for ﬁber photometry during behaviors and
used both male and female heterozygote mice for other experiments with EEG/EMG. After weaning, animals were group-housed until
they were 3-4 months old. Upon the completion of any surgical procedures, mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia on a
heating-pad, and then they were transferred, singly housed (or group-housed for the group-housed cohort) to a new residence
room for full recovery (2-4 weeks) prior to the start of any behavioral experiments or habituation to EEG/EMG tethers. In this

e1 Neuron 94, 1205–1219.e1–e8, June 21, 2017

residence/procedure room, subjects were housed on a 12 h: 12 hr light/dark cycle (light off at 6AM, light on at 6PM) with ad libitum
access to food and water. Animal husbandry and all experimental procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute
of Technology under IACUC protocol 1672.

Surgeries for viral delivery, optical ﬁber and EEG/EMG implantation
General surgical procedures and viral delivery
Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane gas/carbogen mixture (5% for induction and 1.5%–2% for maintenance during surgery) and
placed to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). After shaving their hair and sterilizing the skin with chlorohexidine, a
midline incision was made with a sterile scalpel. The skull surface was wiped and cleaned with autoclaved cotton swabs. Bregma and
lambda were identiﬁed and leveled to be on the same z axis. Small craniotomy holes were made for 20 degree angled injection of
viruses and optical ﬁber implantation over the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN, antero-posterior (AP) axis:  4.65 mm, medio-lateral
(ML) axis: ± 1.2 mm, relative to Bregma). Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV, see below for details) were injected into the DRN
(AP  4.6 mm, ML ± 1.2 mm, dorso-ventral (DV)  2.95 mm, at a 20 degree angle relative to vertical axis from the left and right sides).
Viral injection was performed using a blunt 35-gauge microinjection needle within a 10 uL microsyringe (NanoFil, World Precision
Instruments, FL, USA), which was controlled by a microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments) connected to a controller
(Micro4, World Precision Instruments). 0.3-0.5 uL of AAV was infused per site at a rate of 50 nL per min. Following injection, the
needle/syringe was held in the same location for an additional 10 min to allow further diffusion. To prevent potential backﬂow, the
needle/syringe was slowly withdrawn over approximately 10 min.
EEG and EMG implantation
To implant the EEG/EMG apparatus, three additional craniotomy holes were made in frontal (for ﬁrst EEG channel; AP +2.0 mm,
ML +0.7 mm), central (for second EEG channel; AP  1.3 mm, ML +1.3 mm) and lateral parietal (for reference and ground;
AP  3.5 mm, ML  2.5 mm) regions with a drill bit (#73, 105-0240.340, Kyocera, Kyoto, Japan). 0.10’’ electrodes with wire leads
(8403, Pinnacle Technology Inc., KS, USA) were screwed into the craniotomy holes. With the leads from the screw electrodes
held away from the surface of the skull to prevent accidental glue application, a thin layer of adhesive cement (C&B Metabond, Parkell
Inc., NY, USA) was applied on the skull surface to secure the screw electrodes. Another thin layer of dental cement (51458, Stoelting
Co., IL, USA) was additionally applied until it covered screw heads. The EEG/EMG headmount (8201, Pinnacle Technology Inc.) was
then placed on the dental cement layer and lead wires from screw electrodes were connected to the headmount. Silver epoxy (MG
Chemicals, BC, Canada) was applied to ensure electrical conduction between the lead wires and headmount. An additional layer of
dental cement was applied to secure the headmount to the animal’s head. Finally, EMG leads from the headmount were inserted into
the trapezius muscles and then the incision was closed.
Optical ﬁber implantation (for ﬁber photometry and optogenetic experiments)
Following virus infusion, an optical ferrule/ﬁber with cut length of 4 mm and diameter of 300 um (for optogenetics, NA 0.37, home-
made) or 400 um (for ﬁber photometry, NA 0.48, Doric lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) was ﬁrmly mounted to a stereotaxic holder
(1766AP, David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). An optical ferrule/ﬁber was then inserted to the DRN (AP  4.6 mm, ML ± 1.2 mm,
DV  2.52.7 mm, at a 20 degree angle relative to vertical axis from either left or right side) through a craniotomy hole, and stopped
200 (for ﬁber photometry) or 500 um (for optogenetics) above the viral injection site. A thin layer of adhesive cement was applied on
the skull surface to strongly hold the ferrule/ﬁber. After adhesive cement was completely dried, a thick layer of pink dental cement
was applied to build a robust head cap.
Viral constructs
For ﬁber photometry experiments, 0.5 uL of AAV serotype 5 encoding GCaMP6f or GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013) under synapsin
promoter and Cre-dependent FLEX switch (AAV5-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6f or GCaMP6s, 1.0-1.5 X 1013 genome copies/mL) was unilat-
erally injected. GCaMP6 viruses were packaged and purchased from the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core (Philadelphia, PA,
USA). For optogenetic activation experiments, 0.3 uL of AAV serotype 5 encoding ChR2-eYFP under Ef1a promoter and double-
ﬂoxed inverse open reading frame (DIO) (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2(h134R)-eYFP, 4.5 X 1012 genome copies/mL) was bilaterally injected.
For chemogenetic experiments, 0.3 uL of AAV serotype 2 encoding hM4Di-mCherry under human synapsin promoter and DIO switch
(AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry, 4.0 - 5.0 X 1012 genome copies/mL) was bilaterally injected. For optogenetic inhibition experi-
ments, 0.5 uL of AAV serotype 5 encoding eArch3.0-eYFP under Ef1a promoter and DIO frame (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eArch3.0-eYFP,
3.4 X 1012 genome copies/mL) was bilaterally injected. For control animals, 0.5 uL of AAV5-hSyn-DIO-eGFP (4.7 X 1012 genome
copies/mL) was bilaterally injected. ChR2-eYFP, hM4Di-mCherry, eArch3.0-eYFP and eGFP viruses were packaged and purchased
from the University of North Carolina Vector Core (Chapel Hill, NC, USA). hM4Di-mCherry vector was also purchased from Addgene
(Cambridge, MA, USA).

structures, such as TH-expressing neurons in the DRN, using a single optical ﬁber for both excitation and emission in freely moving
mice (Gunaydin et al., 2014). We based our photometry design from a previous literature (Lerner et al., 2015) with a few modiﬁcations.
Two wavelength LEDs (490 nm for GCaMP6 excitation and 405 nm for isosbestic wavelength excitation, M490F1 and M405F1,

Thorlabs Inc., NJ, USA) were modulated at two different frequencies (211 Hz for 490 nm, 531 Hz for 405 nm), which were controlled by
a real-time processor (RX8-2, Tucker David Technologies, FL, USA) and a custom-written software (provided by Drs. Karl Deisseroth
and Tom Davidson at Stanford University). The emission signal from 405 nm illumination was shown to be Ca2+-independent with
GCaMP6 and to mostly reﬂect bleaching and motion artifacts (Lerner et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016): thus, this signal serves as a control
reference signal. 490 nm and 405 nm excitation lights were passed through GFP and violet cleanup excitation ﬁlters (FF02-472/30-25
and FF01-400/40-25, Semrock, NY, USA) respectively, and reﬂected off dichroic mirrors (DMLP425 and MD498, Thorlabs). Excita-
tion light was coupled into a low auto-ﬂuorescence 400 um patch cord (0.48 NA, 2 m cable length, Doric lenses) with a high NA
coupler/collimator (F240FC-A, Thorlabs). Another end of the patch cord was connected to a ceramic optical ferrule/ﬁber
(1.25 mm diameter ferrule, 400 um diameter ﬁber core) implanted into the brain region of interest in subjects. The LED powers for
both excitation wavelengths were measured with a power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs) and set to be 50-80 uW at the end of the patch
cord. GCaMP6 emission signals were collected through the patch cord and collimator and passed through a dichroic mirror (MD498,
Thorlabs) and a GFP emission ﬁlter (MF525-39, Thorlabs) to reach a femtowatt photoreceiver (Model 2151, Newport Co., Irvine, CA,
USA) using a focusing lens (62-561, Edmunds Optics, Barrington, NJ, USA). Photoreceiver signals were relayed into a RX8-2 proces-
sor through a BNC cable and were demodulated into two signals, corresponding to each LED excitation wavelength based on its
modulation frequency. These outputs were digitized at a sampling rate of 382 Hz and low-pass ﬁltered at 15 Hz. One digital input
channel was additionally acquired to record any TTL pulses from an external source in order to synchronize transients with EEG/
EMG, video recording, and/or behavioral events. Custom-written software was used to control data acquisition and signal
visualization.

Behavioral experiments
All behavioral experiments involving ﬁber photometry were performed at least 2 weeks after viral injection. Behavioral tests with
optogenetics were performed at least 4 weeks after surgery to allow maximal transgene expression. Mice underwent the following
assays during their dark phase (10AM-5PM) in their residence room, unless otherwise stated.
Resident-intruder assay
Mice with an implanted optical ﬁber were connected to a patch cord for recording of ﬁber photometry. After connection, mice were
placed back into their home cages and habituated to the open cage setup for 10 min. After habituation, a juvenile male (3-4 weeks
old), adult female (2-3 months old), or adult male (2-3 months old) mouse was introduced as an intruder into each home cage. Video
recording was performed and synchronized with ﬁber photometry signals. After 5 min, the intruder mouse was removed from the
home cage. The behavior of resident mice, such as investigation and attack (observed only toward adult males), was manually scored
by an experimenter.
Novel object interaction assay
The novel object interaction test setup was almost identical to the resident-intruder assay, but a distinct novel object was placed into
the center of the empty cages instead of an intruder mouse. To run the test, mice were connected to the photometry patch cord, and
habituated to being tethered in the open empty cage environment. Then, a novel object was introduced, and the subject was allowed
to freely explore the object for a 5 min test session. Behavior scoring was manually performed to identify interaction bouts, which
consisted of the subject approaching, snifﬁng, and/or touching of the object with forelimbs.
Familiar object interaction assay
This assay was similar to the novel object interaction assay described above, except that the designated familiar object (similar size
and characteristics as used for the novel objects) was placed into the subject’s home cage 5 days prior to photometry recording
sessions.
Feeding assay
Two days before the experiment, the palatable food treat (approximately 1 g of peanut butter chocolate pieces (Reese’s peanut
butter cups)) was presented to each mouse for consumption. After connecting the mouse to the patch cord, they were placed in
a clean, empty cage. After 5 min of habituation, approximately 2 g of treats in a small weighing boat were introduced into one of
the cage corners. All tested subjects approached and consumed the treat after variable delays. Leftover treats were removed after
10 min. Video recordings were manually scored to identify food consumption bouts.
Air puff
Mice were connected to a patch cord and placed in a clean empty cage without any bedding. Mice were allowed to explore and habit-
uate for 5 min. Six brief (< 1 s) air puffs were applied to the tail using a compressed air duster with an inter-puff interval of 30-60 s. TTL
pulses were sent to the ﬁber photometry digital input channel for time stamping when air puffs were applied.
Unpredictable delivery of electric footshocks
Mice were connected to a patch cord and placed inside an operant chamber (Lafayette Instruments, IN, USA). Mice were allowed to
explore and habituate to the operant box for 10 min. Two mild footshocks (0.3 mA, 1 s) were delivered with intervals of about 30 s. TTL
pulses were sent to the ﬁber photometry digital input channel for accurate time stamping.

Exposure to predator odor
Mice were connected to a patch cord and moved to a clean empty cage. To habituate to this new environment, mice were allowed to
explore for 5 min. After photometry recording started, a ﬁlter paper applied with 10 uL of 2,3,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT, a compo-
nent of fox urine, SRQ Bio, Inc, FL, USA) was introduced to the cage corner. Simultaneous photometry and video recordings were
performed to identify the time point of odor investigation.
Restraint/Immobilization
A test subject was connected to a patch cord and placed to a clean empty cage. A 5 min habituation session was conducted in which
the subject was allowed to freely explore the cage. At the start of ﬁber photometry recording, 3 min of baseline data were obtained.
Then, taking care not to cause signiﬁcant pain to the subject, a trained experimenter restrained the subject for one minute by placing
gentle pressure on the mouse body with the left hand and immobilizing the tail with the right hand. All subjects engaged in active
struggling and escape behaviors. Recordings were terminated after 3 min of recovery.
Tail suspension test
Mice were connected to a patch cord, and the tail was placed between strips of common lab tape, which was afﬁxed to a horizontal
bar suspended about 50 cm from the ground. We additionally put a lightweight (1 g) plastic cylinder around the tail to prevent the
mouse from climbing onto the tail. Synchronized ﬁber photometry and video recordings were performed for 5 min, and video was
manually and blindly scored to pinpoint ‘‘mobility’’ bouts during which the animals struggled by moving their bodies.
Open ﬁeld test
Mice were connected to a patch cord, transferred to the open ﬁeld box (50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm), and habituated to this setup for
10-15 min prior to the start of 15 min test sessions. A video camera positioned above the behavioral arena and connected to
EthoVision XT 9 software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands) allowed tracking of subject position and
velocity throughout the test session. Fiber photometry and video recordings were synchronized via TTL pulses generated by the
Noldus USB-IO box. Fiber photometry experiments took place during the subjects’ dark phase (10AM-5PM). For optogenetic exper-
iments, open ﬁeld tests were performed during both the dark phase (9AM-1PM) and light phase (6PM-10PM) to examine whether
locomotion varied across the circadian cycle. The order of open ﬁeld test sessions during dark and light phases was counter-
balanced.
Real-time place preference/aversion assay
A subject was connected to a patch cord and transferred to the open ﬁeld box (50 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm), which was divided into left
and right compartments. The subject was given free access to explore the two compartments for 30 min. However, upon entering the
‘‘paired chamber,’’ the subject received phasic bursts of optogenetic stimulation (30 Hz, 10 pulses, 10 ms pulse width, every 5 s). The
side paired with optogenetic stimulation was counter-balanced. EthoVision XT 9 software (Noldus) was used to track the movement
and location of mice. As a dependent variable, time spent in the paired compartment was quantiﬁed.

EEG/EMG data acquisition, processing, and sleep-wake state classiﬁcation
After EEG/EMG implantation surgery, animals were single-housed for four weeks in a regular mouse cage for recovery and transgene
’ diameter and 12’’ height) and connected to a custom-
expression. Mice were then transferred to a transparent cylindrical cage (12
ized pre-ampliﬁer (10x gain, 0.5 Hz high-pass ﬁlter, 10 Hz high-pass ﬁlter for EMG; Pinnacle Technology Inc., Lawrence, KS, USA) and
a commutator (8204, Pinnacle Technology Inc.) for freely moving recordings. They were habituated for at least seven days to the
recording setup before beginning any experiments. On the 7th day, four animals were randomly selected per group (depending on
the viral transgene they expressed) and 24 hr baseline recordings were performed to test whether viral transgene expression or other
experimental artifacts altered the sleep-wake architecture of subjects. Food and water were available ad libitum. EEG/EMG signals
were digitized through the OmniPlex System (Plexon, TX, USA) with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz in most experiments, or through
Pinnacle Sirenia Acquisition (Pinnacle Technology Inc, KS, USA) with a sampling rate of 400 Hz (for 24 hr baseline recordings
and chemogenetic experiments in presence of salient stimuli). Mice with lost EEG and EMG signals were excluded from the
experiment - very occasionally, some mice showed a low signal-to-noise ratio or unintelligible EEG/EMG traces.

Data acquired in Plexon’s or Pinnacle’s proprietary ﬁle format (.pl2 or .pvfs) were converted to European data format (.edf) with
MATLAB (MathWorks, MA, USA) using the EEGLAB plug-in (Schwartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Polysomnographic EEG/EMG recordings were loaded, and behavioral states were scored using sleep analysis software
(SleepSign for Animal, Kissei Comtec Co., Nagano, Japan).

Sleep-wake state classiﬁcation is manually performed based on visual and spectral signatures of EEG and EMG signals. States
were assigned across consecutive non-overlapping 5 s windows. We deﬁned wakefulness as desynchronized, low-amplitude,
and high-frequency EEG rhythms with elevated EMG activity. We deﬁned NREM sleep as synchronized, high-amplitude, and low-
frequency (< 4 Hz) EEG activity with lower tonic EMG tone. We deﬁned REM sleep as containing prominent theta (6-10 Hz) oscillations
on EEG and minimal EMG activity. All sleep-wake state scorings were performed by an experimenter (J.R.C.), who was blind to
expressed transgene and experimental conditions.

Optogenetic and chemogenetic modulation of behavioral states and locomotion
For optogenetic experiments, one side of a patch cord (1.25 mm ceramic ferrule, 300 um diameter, Doric lenses) was connected to
the implanted optical ferrule/ﬁber with another side (FC/PC connector) connected to a swivel commutator (ﬁber-optic rotary joints,

Neuron 94, 1205–1219.e1–e8, June 21, 2017 e4

FRJ_1x1_FC-FC, Doric lenses) to allow free movement. Another patch cord was connected from the commutator to a 473 nm laser
(MLL-FN-473nm/150mW, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology, Changchun, China). The intensity of the laser
beam was measured with an optical power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs) and set to be 10 mW at the tip. Laser output was controlled
by a TTL pulse generator (OTPG4, Doric lenses) via a BNC cable. For phasic stimulation, ten 30-Hz, 10-ms pulses were applied every
5 s. For tonic stimulation, continuous 2-Hz, 10-ms pulses were used. These phasic and tonic parameters were chosen to have the
same number of pulses for a given duration but with distinct temporal pattern. Both phasic and tonic patterns of stimulation were
applied for 2 min with intervals of 20-25 min. Animals used for optogenetic experiments were always connected to the preampliﬁer
and Plexon system to continuously acquire EEG and EMG signals for sleep-wake state classiﬁcation. TTL signals for controlling laser
output were split and input into the Plexon acquisition system through an analog input for accurate time stamping of triggered stim-
ulation. All optogenetic experiments with EEG/EMG monitoring were carried out during the light phase (6 PM-6 AM).

To test whether the wake-promoting effect of DRNDA activation was mediated by direct action of DA, DRNDA-ChR2 and DRNDA-eGFP
mice that were habituated to the recording setup were systemically administered dopamine receptor antagonists SCH-23390 (a se-
lective D1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg) and eticlopride (a selective D2 antagonist, 1 mg/kg) 45 min before the onset of the light phase. The
concentration of these dopamine antagonists was selected based on a previous literature (Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016). For con-
trols, we injected sterile saline at the same circadian time. EEG/EMG recording and phasic optogenetic stimulation started at the light
phase onset and lasted for 2 hr.

To study whether the wake-promoting effect of optogenetic DRNDA stimulation is inﬂuenced by homeostatic sleep pressure,
DRNDA-ChR2 or DRNDA-eGFP mice were sleep deprived for 0 or 4 hr by gentle handling (Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016). The order of
experiments (0 or 4 hr deprivation) was counter-balanced across animals. For sleep deprivation, mice were continuously monitored
by an experimenter (with EEG and EMG recordings turned on). Mice were softly touched by a brush whenever they become motion-
less and/or exhibited reduced EMG tone or absent EMG bursts. After the sleep deprivation procedure, two phasic bursts (30 Hz,
15 pulses, 10 ms width, 5 s interval) were applied about 510 min after they entered into NREM sleep, and the latency to wake tran-
sitions was measured.

To study the causal effect of increased DRNDA activity on locomotion, we performed the open ﬁeld test with DRNDA-ChR2 and
DRNDA-eGFP mice. Procedures and experimental equipment were similar those described above for open ﬁeld testing during ﬁber
photometry, with video monitoring and subject position and velocity tracking recorded throughout all sessions. Mice were ﬁrst habit-
uated in the open ﬁeld for 20 min. After acquiring 20 min of baseline activity (not including habituation), laser stimulation (phasic or
tonic patterns) was delivered for 5 min. After stimulation, ﬁve additional minutes were recorded. Throughout testing, distance traveled
during 5 min epochs (before, during, and after stimulation) were analyzed.

For chemogenetic experiments, animals with hM4Di-mCherry or eGFP injection were connected to the data acquisition system for
EEG and EMG signals. Animals were habituated to experimenter handling for 3-4 days before any experiments commenced. Saline
or clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, selective ligand for hM4Di, 1 mg/kg dissolved in saline; Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Exeter, UK) was intra-
peritoneally injected immediately prior to the start of testing at 9 AM (3 hr after dark phase onset). Recordings were carried out for 2 hr
following injection.

To test whether DRNDA neuronal activity is required for wake maintenance after exposure to salient environmental stimuli,
DRNDA-hM4Di or DRNDA-eGFP mice (which were already habituated to experimenter’s handling) were ﬁrst injected with saline or
CNO (1 mg/kg) 45 min before testing. Then, a female mouse (contained in an inverted wire cup, thus not directly accessible for
mounting) or a ﬁlter paper with predator odor TMT was introduced into the recording cage. We chose these two stimuli because
they are of opposite valence (positive versus negative) and were shown effective in inducing robust DRNDA neuronal activity (See
Figures 1 and S2). EEG/EMG recording began immediately after introduction of the salient stimulus and lasted for 1 hr.

Auditory cue arousal test
To examine whether DRNDA ﬁring mediates cue-induced arousal from sleep, we performed simultaneous recording of ﬁber photom-
etry and EEG/EMG signals on DRNDA-GCaMP6s mice. On each experimental day, recordings began at the light phase onset (6PM).
Auditory tonal stimuli (65 dB; 2, 3, or 5 kHz frequency; 2-Hz pulse; 250-ms pulse width, 10 s duration) were randomly applied during
the ﬁrst half of the light phase (for 6 hr) with a minimum inter-trial interval of 15 min from a speaker located adjacent to the testing
cages. In order to limit habituation to speciﬁc tonal frequencies, three different tones were administered in random order with a
33.3% probability for each frequency. The speaker was placed 30 cm away from the cage, and the auditory tone intensity inside
the cylindrical cage was calibrated with a sound meter (Digital Sound Level Meter, Foneso, Shenzhen, China) before the beginning
of each session with mice temporarily removed from the room. TTL pulses time-locked to the auditory cues were generated and
inputted into the Plexon data acquisition system for accurate time stamping.

Sleep-wake states were classiﬁed as described above by an experimenter (J.R.C.) who was blind to the experimental conditions.
Depending on the behavioral consequence of auditory cues, each trial was classiﬁed as 1) sleep-to-wake transitions (further divided
from NREM or from REM sleep), 2) sleep-to-sleep (when auditory cue failed to induce wakefulness), and 3) wake-to-wake (auditory
stimuli that were administered during wakefulness) cases. In order for a trial to be scored as a sleep-to-wake transition, animals had
to show at least 3 s of wake EEG and EMG signs (EEG: desynchronized from delta or theta rhythm, EMG: sudden phasic elevation of
muscle activity) within 10 s of the auditory cue onset. If these criteria were not met, the trial was categorized as sleep-to-sleep.

e5 Neuron 94, 1205–1219.e1–e8, June 21, 2017

To test for the necessity of DRNDA ﬁring in auditory cue-induced arousal from sleep, we inhibited DRNDA neurons in a time-locked
manner with the inhibitory proton pump eArch3.0 (Arch). The experimental setup was identical to the procedure described above,
except we used a slightly higher intensity tone (70 dB) to avoid possible ﬂoor effects, and 20 s of 532 nm green laser (10 mW at
the tip) was continuously applied surrounding the tone presentation (starting 5 s before the tone, terminating 5 s after the end of
the tone) to the DRNDA-Arch or DRNDA-eGFP mice. Only data epochs when auditory cues were turned on during NREM or REM sleep
were considered and we manually reviewed whether auditory tones caused wake transitions (see above for speciﬁc criteria). If cues
successfully woke up the animal, they were categorized as ‘NREM-to-Wake’ or ‘REM-to-Wake’ trials. If tones did not lead to imme-
diate wake transitions, they were categorized as ‘NREM-to-NREM’ or ‘REM-to-REM’ trials. To conﬁrm that sleep-related oscillations
(delta for NREM and theta for REM) were not perturbed in ‘NREM-to-NREM’ and ‘REM-to-REM’ trials, we calculated the delta and
theta amplitude for NREM and REM, respectively, and determine whether there were any changes across the tone onset (see Fig-
ure S6H-S6K).

Data analysis
Fiber photometry data processing and analysis
Acquired data ﬁles were loaded and processed with custom-written codes in MATLAB. Pre-processing was performed as previously
described (Lerner et al., 2015). Fiber photometry traces from 490 and 405 nm excitation wavelengths were ﬁrst low-pass ﬁltered at
2 Hz using a 4th order Butterworth ﬁlter with zero-phase distortion. To calculate DF/F, a linear ﬁt was applied to 405-nm signal and
aligned to the 490-nm signal. The ﬁtted 405-nm signal was subtracted from the 490-nm signal and then divided by the ﬁtted 405-nm
signal again to yield the DF/F time-series.

To visualize peri-event photometry traces, DF/F data epochs were extracted around immediately before and after relevant behav-
ioral events (e.g., event onsets identiﬁed by either video scoring or TTL pulses) and averaged. For statistical comparison between
baseline and behavior, areas under the curve (AUC) per second values were calculated for given conditions. Similarly, to visualize
Ca2+ ﬂuorescence change across state transitions, the temporal location of state transitions were identiﬁed, and 120 s of photometry
traces around the transition time points were extracted and averaged. AUC was also calculated to compare DRNDA population
activity before and after transitions. We performed analyses for NREM-to-wake, REM-to-wake, wake-to-NREM, and NREM-to-
REM transitions. We excluded other possible combinations as rodents rarely transit directly from REM to NREM, and none of the
tested mice showed wake-to-REM transitions, which is a common feature of narcolepsy. We termed periods of less than 15 s of
wakefulness after REM state as ‘‘short arousal’’ and we separately plotted these transitions as ‘‘REM-to-short arousal-to-NREM’’
(See Figure S3L).

To detect Ca2+ peak events from photometry traces and quantify them across sleep-wake states, we ﬁrst normalized the trace
using z-score and then high-pass ﬁltered at 0.01 Hz using 2nd order butterworth ﬁlter with zero-phase distortion to eliminate possible
low-frequency ﬂuctuations across states. Then we detected prominent Ca2+ peak events with an amplitude threshold, which was
deﬁned as the 75th percentile of the entire photometry data amplitude distribution. This percentile threshold was heuristically chosen
because the photometry amplitude distribution is positively skewed and does not follow Gaussian distribution, which makes it more
sensitive to the presence of outliers (such as during Ca2+ peak events). For quantiﬁcation of these detected events, we calculated
1) peak amplitude, 2) duration (from detection onset to offset), 3) frequency or number of events in a 5 s window, and 4) summed
AUC values of detected events in a 5 s window.

In order to account for inter-subject variability in amplitude during investigations into the temporal dynamics of DRNDA activity dur-
ing each behavioral state from onset to offset, we ﬁrst converted the ﬂuorescence traces into z-scores (calculated from the entire
traces). Next, photometry traces from each state including 10% of the trace before and after were cropped and down-sampled to
120 points in order to normalize the timescale. This allowed us to project variable length photometry traces containing z-score
normalized ﬂuorescence changes onto the normalized time of  0.1 to 1.1, where 0 notes the onset and 1 notes the offset of a
wake or sleep episode.

To examine any correlation between DRNDA activity and locomotion, we obtained the synchronized recordings of ﬁber photometry
and video tracking. To test if increased DRNDA activity is associated with any change in locomotion, we detected prominent Ca2+
peak events as previously described above, extracted 10 s of velocity traces around peak event onsets, and then averaged.
Conversely, to test if initiation of locomotion is associated increased DRNDA activity, we detected locomotion onset similarly as
the Ca2+ peak events (but with 65th percentile as an amplitude threshold), extracted 10 s of photometry traces around locomotion
onsets, and then averaged.
EEG spectrogram
To visualize spectral and temporal proﬁles of EEG activity across distinct behavioral states, we decomposed EEG into time-fre-

quency plan using Morlet wavelet. EEG data epoch of interest was convolved with a complex Morlet wavelet, wðt; f0Þ, having a
Gaussian shape both in the time ðstÞ and frequency ðsfÞ domain around its central frequency, f0:
expð2ipf0tÞ; where sf = 1=2pst:

A wavelet family was characterized by a constant ðf0=sfÞ ratio of 6 from 1 to 20 Hz in 1 Hz steps. The time-varying energy of the
signal, Eðt; f0Þ, is deﬁned as the squared norm of the convolution product of a complex wavelet wðt; f0Þ, with the signal
s(t): Eðt; f0Þ =jwðt; f0Þ3sðtÞj 2.

Time-varying energy is then smoothed by a moving average ﬁlter with span of 2 s for each frequency step to enhance visualization.

Calculation of EEG frequency band
To extract time-varying amplitude of a certain EEG frequency band (e.g., 0.5-4 Hz for delta, 5-10 Hz for theta, and 40-100 Hz for high-
frequency - notch ﬁlter was applied from 58 to 62 Hz before calculating high-frequency activity amplitude to avoid any contribution
from 60 Hz line noise), the signal of interest was ﬁrst band-pass ﬁltered using a 2nd order Butterworth ﬁlter. A zero-phase shift ﬁlter
was used to prevent any phase distortion. Instantaneous amplitude was obtained by taking the absolute value of the Hilbert transform
of the band-passed signal. EEG frequency band amplitude signals were smoothed by a moving average ﬁlter (with 10 s window for
Figures 4 and S4 and with 2 s window for Figures 6 and S6) and then normalized using z-score with respect to the baseline. EEG data
epochs containing high-amplitude artifacts were excluded from analysis.
Power spectral density
Power spectral density was estimated for EEG data using a Welch’s method. We used a 5 s window size and 50% overlap to estimate
power from 0.5 to 100 Hz (except from 58 to 62 Hz). For 1 hr chronic optogenetic stimulation, spectral power changes during opto-
genetic stimulation with respect to the baseline (1 hr before the stimulation) were obtained for both DRNDA-ChR2 and DRNDA-eGFP
mice. For chemogenetic experiments, spectral power changes of CNO conditions from saline conditions were calculated at each
frequency step. EEG data epochs with high-amplitude artifacts were excluded from analysis.
Efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of GCaMP6f+ expression
Efﬁciency was deﬁned as ‘‘the number of GCaMP6f+ and TH+ neurons out of the total number of TH+ neurons.’’ Speciﬁcity was
deﬁned as ‘‘the number of GCaMP6f+ and TH+ neurons out of the total number of GCaMP6f+ neurons.’’

Ex vivo electrophysiology
TH-cre mice expressing ChR2-eYFP or hM4Di-mCherry were euthanized with carbon dioxide and transcardially perfused with ice-
cold sucrose-based cutting solution saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 (carbogen) that contained (mM) 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl,
1.25 NaH2PO4, 4.0 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 24 NaHCO3 and 25 glucose. The brain was removed and 250-mm coronal slices that contained
the DRN were prepared in oxygenated cutting solution using a vibratome (VT-1200, Leica Biosystems, IL, USA). Slices were recov-
C for one hour prior to recording in carbogenated ACSF containing (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2,
ered at 32
2.4 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose. Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused (1.5 - 2.0 mL/min) with carb-
C. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of ﬂuorescently tagged (TH+) DRN neurons were obtained
ogen-saturated ACSF at 32 ± 0.5
using a MultiClamp 700B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and a Digidata 1440 analog-to-digital converter (Molecular
Devices). Data were sampled at 10 kHz and ﬁltered at 2 kHz with Clampex 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Patch electrodes had resistance
of 4 - 6 MU and were ﬁlled with a potassium gluconate intrapipette solution (mM): 135 K gluconate, 5 KCl, 5 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl2,
10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 GTP. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Clampﬁt 10.4 (Molecular Devices). For Figure S4A,
light-evoked currents (voltage clamp) and action potentials (current clamp) were evoked by ten of 30 Hz (10 ms pulse width)
blue (420-455 nm) light delivered by an LED light source (Lumencor, OR, USA) in neurons held at  70mV. Once we patched
hM4Di-mCherry+ or eGFP+ DRNDA cells (Figures S5A–S5E), neuronal ﬁring was evoked by depolarizing the membrane potential
to  45 mV in current clamp mode. After collecting baseline for 2 min, 1 mM of CNO was applied to the bath for neuronal silencing.
After 3-4 min, CNO was washed out.

Fluor 488 (1:500; 703-545-155, 711-545-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch), anti-goat/rabbit Rhodamine Red-X (1:500; 705-297-003,
711-297-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and anti-rabbit/chicken Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500, 711-607-003, 703-606-155, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) were used.
Confocal microscopy imaging
Fluorescent images from brain tissue were acquired by a LSM 780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). We used a 10x
Plan Apochromat air objective (NA 0.45), 25x Plan Apochromat water immersion objective (NA 1.2) and 4 laser wavelengths (405 nm,
488 nm, 561 nm, and 633 nm). Image acquisition was controlled by Zen 2011 software (Zeiss), which also allowed automated z stack-
ing, tiling, and maximum intensity projection. Images were not further processed.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All data are represented as mean ± SEM. Sample sizes were determined to be comparable to previous studies that used optoge-
netics or chemogenetics to study neural circuits of sleep and wake state regulation (Xu et al., 2015; Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016).
All statistical analyses were performed with in-built functions of the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox in MATLAB (Mathworks)
or Prism (GraphPad). Paired and unpaired t tests were used for single value comparisons. One-way ANOVA was used to compare
more than two groups. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to perform group comparisons with multiple measurements.
Data are considered to be statistically signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. We used Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons where
appropriate.
