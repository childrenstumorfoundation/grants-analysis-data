AIM Difﬁculties in neurocognition and social interaction are the most prominent causes of
morbidity and long-term disability in children with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). Symptoms of
attention-deﬁcit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have also been extensively recognized in NF1.
However, systematic evaluation of symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children with
NF1 has been limited.
METHOD We present a retrospective, cross-sectional study of the prevalence of symptoms of ASD
and ADHD and their relationship in a consecutive series of 66 patients from our NF1 clinic. The
Social Responsiveness Scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale were used
to assess symptoms of ASD and ADHD.
RESULTS Sixty-six participants (42 males, 24 females) were included in this study. Mean age at
assessment was 10 years 11 months (SD 5y 4mo). Forty percent of our NF1 sample had raised
symptom levels reaching clinical signiﬁcance on the Social Responsiveness Scale (T ‡ 60), and
14% reached levels consistent with those seen in children with ASDs (T ‡ 75). These raised levels
were not explained by NF1 disease severity or externalizing ⁄ internalizing behavioral disorders.
There was a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between symptoms of ADHD and ASD (v2=9.11,
df=1, p=0.003, /=0.56). Particularly salient were the relationships between attention and hyper-
activity deﬁcits, with impairments in social awareness and social motivation.
INTERPRETATION We found that symptoms of ASD in our NF1 population were raised, consistent
with previous reports. Further characterization of the speciﬁc ASD symptoms and their impact on
daily function is fundamental to the development and implementation of effective interventions in
this population, which will probably include a combination of medical and behavioral approaches.

Neurocognitive and learning-related deﬁcits in pediatric neu-
roﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) are associated with the greatest
level of disease morbidity.1–3 In addition to neurocognitive
deﬁcits, extensively described elsewhere,3,4 upwards of 50% of
the population with NF1 meets DSM-IV-TR5 diagnostic
criteria for attention-deﬁcit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
and the associated attention and executive function deﬁcits are
particularly problematical and functionally limiting in this
population.1–3,6 Such neurocognitive impairments are related
to disruptions in academic functioning1,7 and socialization.4

It is well accepted that social deﬁcits occur in individuals
with NF1.4,8,9 Barton and North reported that nearly 40% of
their population with NF1 had social interaction problems in
the borderline ⁄ clinical range. They also noted the signiﬁcant
role of comorbid ADHD in poor social outcomes.4 In addi-
tion, associations between neurocognitive deﬁcits commonly
seen in NF1 and poor social functioning have been described.

Huijbregts and de Sonneville showed that cognitive control
(i.e. a combination of processing speed, working memory,
inhibitory control, and emotional processing functions) was
associated with the presence of autistic traits.10

Pervasive developmental disorders include several currently
distinct diagnostic categories: autistic disorder, Asperger dis-
order, and pervasive developmental disorders, not otherwise
speciﬁed. All of these disorders are characterized by function-
ally disruptive impairments in social interaction and social
communication. Disruptions in social interactions may mani-
fest as poor use of non-verbal behaviors, lack of age-appropri-
ate peer relationships, lack of spontaneous sharing, or no
social ⁄ emotional reciprocity. Social communication impair-
ments may include limited or delayed language development,
an inability to communicate effectively despite adequately
developed speech, stereotyped or repetitive use of language, or
lack of developmentally appropriate imaginative play. A diag-

nosis of autistic disorder also requires the presence of some
level of restricted repetitive behavior,
interest, or activity,
which can include preoccupation with restricted areas of inter-
est or parts of objects, inﬂexibility, or stereotyped and repeti-
tive motor behaviors.5 Interest in the presence of symptoms of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in NF1 has increased, as 1 to
15% of children diagnosed with an ASD have been found to
also have NF1.11,12 Additionally, Williams and Herch found
4% of their NF1 sample had comorbid ASD, suggesting that
it should be regarded as one of the neurodevelopmental risks
associated with NF1.13

Social deﬁcits occur in as much as 50% of children with
ADHD.14 These children are more likely to be rejected by their
peers, struggle to establish and maintain relationships, and be
viewed as aggressive, intrusive, and to lack empathy.15 Grzad-
zinski et al.16 reported that among children with a primary
ADHD diagnosis, a subgroup had raised ratings on core ASD
traits. Elevations in ratings of ASD symptomatology were not
solely explained by the behavioral impairments associated with
ADHD; social reciprocity impairments are present in individu-
als with ADHD across the range of ASD symptoms.14,16

Although ADHD symptoms and social competence deﬁcits
are frequently identiﬁed in individuals with NF1, the relation-
ship between these symptoms has not been systematically
explored. The aims of this study therefore were to (1) docu-
ment the prevalence of ASD symptomatology in a sample of
children with NF1 and describe symptom patterns, (2) deter-
mine how the presence of comorbid ADHD symptomatology
contributes to raised levels of ASD symptoms, and (3) deter-
mine if there are differences in sex or NF1 disease severity in
the presence of raised ASD symptomatology. We hypothe-
sized that individuals with NF1 would show a higher preva-
lence of ASD symptomatology relative to general population
norms, with males surpassing females. We further hypo-
thesized that raised symptoms of ADHD and ASD would
overlap in this clinical population with NF1.

METHOD
Participants
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC,
USA and informed consent was obtained for each participant.
As part of the intake process, all patients referred to the neuro-
ﬁbromatosis clinic at the Children’s National Medical Center
receive an intake screening pack, which includes the Social
Responsiveness Scale (SRS),17 the Vanderbilt ADHD Diag-
nostic Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS),18 as well as demo-
graphic and family history questions. We had a 51% return
rate on all screening packs dispersed after initial referral to the
clinic. No information is available on patients for whom packs
were not returned as they may not have ever been seen in our
clinic. The ﬁnal number for each of our analyses varies based
on the measure used in the analysis and the statistical
approach. To maximize power, our full sample of 66 partici-
pants was used in the cluster analysis as this analysis is based
on individual item responses for individual participants (nor-
mative data is not relevant for this analysis). When reporting

on descriptive sample characteristics relative to the presence
or absence of raised levels of symptomatology, our sample was
reduced as some participants were excluded based on age (out-
side of the age range for a particular scale). Speciﬁcally, 52
children were eligible for analyses related to clinical manifesta-
tions on the SRS, which is normed for ages 4 to 18 years. The
VADPRS has a more restricted age range (6–12y), leaving us
with 29 eligible participants for those analyses. Disease sever-
ity was operationalized as the number of National Institutes of
Health-deﬁned diagnostic criteria for NF1.19

Instruments
Social Responsiveness Scale
The SRS is a screening instrument designed to identify social
impairments and to distinguish symptoms of ASD from other
childhood conditions.17 It comprises 65 items, which contribute
to ﬁve categorical subscales: social awareness, social information
processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication, social
anxiety ⁄ avoidance, and autistic preoccupations and traits. The
threshold for clinically signiﬁcant impairment is a score of 60 or
greater. Scores of 75 or more indicate levels of symptomatology
consistent with an ASD. It is norm referenced for ages 4 to
18 years, and we used the parent report form for this study.

Participants were classiﬁed on the SRS based on published
cut-off scores associated with clinically signiﬁcant raised levels
of symptomatology (T‡60). In addition, participants were
grouped using the cut-off of 75 or more, which is associated
with diagnosis of an ASD.

Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale
The VADPRS is designed to be a screening tool for evaluating
the presence of ADHD, oppositional deﬁant disorder, conduct
disorder, and anxiety ⁄ depression.18 Questions are speciﬁcally
based on the DSM-IV TR5 criteria for each disorder. This
scale is designed for use in children 6 to 12 years of age, and is
completed by a parent or guardian.

Although a formal diagnosis of ADHD cannot be presumed
without conﬁrmatory ratings from another source (e.g. tea-
cher), we dichotomized the group to raised or non-raised
symptoms of ADHD. Participants were categorized as having
ADHD-associated symptom levels (ADHD+) if they met the
diagnostic criteria for ADHD based on the parent-reported
VADPRS or were taking stimulant medication at the time of
evaluation. We presumed that subclinical scores on the VAD-
PRS in patients taking stimulant medication were related to
response to ADHD treatment.

Statistical analysis
Frequencies and proportions were estimated for categorical
variables, and means and standard deviations were calculated

for continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared
using a v2 test. Continuous variables ﬁtting both normality
and homogeneity of variances were compared using the two-
sample t-test and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test.
These tests were performed to determine if patients with NF1
differed signiﬁcantly by sex in the domains of the VADPRS
and SRS questionnaires.

We computed pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients to
determine whether VADPRS and SRS scores were signiﬁ-
cantly correlated by domain, applying the false discovery rate20
procedure to correct for multiple comparisons.

We used latent class cluster analysis to identify clusters and
deﬁne symptom proﬁles among individuals. Latent class clus-
ter analysis models containing 1 to 5 classes were ﬁtted to the
data using Latent GOLD 4.5 (Statistical Innovations, Bel-
mont, MA, USA). Latent GOLD uses both expectation–maxi-
mization and Newton–Raphson algorithms
to ﬁnd the
maximum likelihood for each model after estimating model
parameters. In the latent class cluster models, separate analyses
were performed for each of the domains of the VADPRS
(inattention, hyperactivity, oppositional deﬁant disorder, con-
duct disorder, and anxiety ⁄ depression) and the SRS (social
awareness, social cognition, social communication, autistic
mannerisms, and social motivation). As covariates for all mod-
els, we used sex (male = 0; female = 1) and age at diagnosis as
continuous variables following previous reports.21–24 Individu-
als with incomplete information were excluded. For modeling,
)6 between consecutive interactions
a tolerance of less than 10
and a maximum of 2000 interactions for both the expectation–
maximization and Newton–Raphson algorithms were chosen.
The number of clusters was selected using a likelihood ratio
test evaluating whether increases in likelihood (L2) associated
with increased latent classes justiﬁed their inclusion. Further,
certainty of these clusters was assessed calculating p values
associated with L2 values after running 500 parametric boot-
strap replicates. As implemented in Latent GOLD, individuals
are assigned posterior membership probabilities for belonging
to each cluster based on their symptom proﬁles; individuals
were additionally assigned to the cluster for which the poster-
ior probability was highest.

We used hierarchical clustering to analyze clustering of
component features in our sample. Hierarchical clustering
uses an agglomerative algorithm that joins the most similar
component features and then joins the next most similar using
the ﬁrst aggregation as a single combined unit such that clus-
ters are generated via complete linkage. To assess the uncer-
tainty of the analysis, approximately unbiased and bootstrap
probability p values were calculated in R using 10 000 boot-
strap samples as implemented in the pvclust package (Ryota
Suzuki and Hidetoshi Shimodaira25). We used 85% as the
cut-off for the approximately unbiased p values.

RESULTS
For our full sample (n=66; 42 males, 24 females), the mean age
at assessment was 10 years 11 months (SD 5y 4mo). Males
and females did not differ statistically in age (p=0.326). The
mean number of NF1 stigmata was 2.8 (SD 0.66), with eight

cases (12%) of optic glioma. Only 28% of our sample had
familial NF1.

Twenty-four participants (nine females, 15 males) were cat-
egorized into the ADHD+ group based on meeting one or
both of the criteria deﬁned above (mean age 11y 4mo, SD 4y
6mo). Speciﬁcally, 46% met criteria based on raised scores on
the VADPRS (n=11; eight males, three females), another 46%
met criteria based on being actively treated for ADHD (n=11;
seven males, four females), whereas the remaining 8% (n=2;
both female) met both criteria (raised scores and active treat-
ment). VADPRS and SRS scores did not differ signiﬁcantly by
sex (VADPRS p=0.108; SRS p=0.793).

Mean Total ASD score on the parent SRS (n=52)
approached clinically signiﬁcant levels deﬁned as T‡60 (mean
57.9, SD 14.2), consistent with other clinical comparison sam-
ples.10,26 Reported levels on the individual SRS subscales also
neared clinically signiﬁcant levels, particularly autistic manner-
isms (Fig. 1a).

The percentage of our NF1 sample that reached clinically
raised symptomatology, with T scores ranging from 60 to 74
was 27% (n=31) for total symptoms, and ranged from 29 to
31% across the various subdomains. Scores of 75 or above are
associated with raised levels of symptoms consistent with those
seen in ASD, and 13% (n=7) of our sample reached that level
for the total SRS score. Across subdomains, rates ranged from
2 to 13% reaching this level of clinical elevation (Fig. 1b).

The relationship between raised symptoms of ADHD and
ASD (total T‡60) was statistically signiﬁcant with a moderate
effect size (v2=9.11, df=1, p=0.003, /=0.56). Exploratory analy-
ses were completed to examine the relationship of ADHD
symptoms with speciﬁc subdomains of social functioning (SRS
subscales). Statistically signiﬁcant
relations were found
between ADHD symptoms and social cognition (v2=11.5,
df=1, p=0.001) as well as social communication (v2=7.2, df=1,
p=0.007), both with moderate effect sizes. The presence of
raised ADHD symptoms was not signiﬁcantly related to social
awareness, social motivation, or autistic mannerisms.

To explore the relationship between anxiety and ASD
symptoms, ratings on the VADPRS anxiety ⁄ depression scale
were analyzed. We found no signiﬁcant relationship for anxi-
ety ⁄ depression (r=)0.01, p=0.97) or emotional problems
(r=0.24, p=0.22).

signiﬁcant

statistically

Males and females did not differ signiﬁcantly in being repre-
sented in the high ASD symptom groups (v2=3.16, df=1,
p=0.08). However,
relationships
emerged between sex and social communication (v2=9.4, df=1,
p=0.002, /=0.57), and social motivation (v2=4.4, df=1, p=0.04,
/=0.39), with males rated with a higher mean number of
symptoms than females. Borderline signiﬁcance was found
between sex and social cognition (v2=3.8, df=1, p=0.05). We
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between NF1 disease
severity and ASD symptomatology (SRS total score; r=0.24,
p=0.21).

Using latent class cluster analysis, we identiﬁed three signif-
icant independent and mutually exclusive clusters for the in-
attention, hyperactivity ⁄ impulsivity, oppositional deﬁant
disorder, and anxiety⁄ depression VADPRS domains in our

maximally expanded sample (n=66; Fig. 2). Because of small
variability in the predictors, a common problem when working
with multinomial responses, latent class cluster analysis mod-
els could not be ﬁtted to the VADPRS conduct disorder
domain or to any of the dimensions of the SRS questionnaire.
Figure 3 presents the results of the hierarchical clustering
and bootstrap-based validation for the VADPRS and SRS
scores. In the ﬁrst case, only the cluster deﬁned by the inatten-
tion, hyperactivity⁄ impulsivity, oppositional deﬁant disorder,
conduct disorder, and anxiety ⁄ depression scores appear to be
strongly supported by the data at the 85% level (Fig. 3). This
result suggests that, in patients with NF1, all VADPRS scores
except the performance score (Q48–Q55) tend to appear
together more often. Furthermore, although not supported at

134 Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology 2013, 55: 131–138

the 85% level, the inattention and hyperactivity ⁄ impulsivity
scores, as well as the oppositional deﬁant disorder, conduct
disorder, and anxiety ⁄ depression scores, seem to co-occur
within this cluster. For the SRS questionnaire, only the cluster
deﬁned by the social awareness, social cognition, autistic man-
nerisms, and social motivation scores is supported at 85%
(Fig. 3). Within this cluster, the social awareness and social
motivation scores seem to appear as an entity and the same is
true for the social cognition and autistic mannerisms scores.
However, only the ﬁrst subcluster is supported at the 85%
level.

When the scores of both questionnaires are considered
together (Fig. 3), two clusters of clinical symptoms emerge
supported by the data at the 85% level. Interestingly, domains
from both questionnaires form the ﬁrst cluster and only
domains from the SRS deﬁne the second cluster.

After correction for false discovery rate, only ﬁve correla-
tions remained signiﬁcant, four of them involving the inatten-
tion score of the VADPRS and all the SRS scores, except the
social awareness score, and one between the hyperactiv-
ity⁄ impulsivity VADPRS score and the social cognition SRS
score (r=0.32, 95% CI 0.084–0.52, false discovery rate cor-
rected p value 0.022). Tables SI and SII (online supporting
information) present item level means for both the VADPRS
and the SRS.

DISCUSSION
Although most previous research has focused on general social
dysfunction in children with NF1, we followed the approach
in previous research by Huijbregts and de Sonneville10 by tar-
geting speciﬁc social impairment symptoms associated with
ASD. We found the prevalence of ASD symptomatology in
our population of children with NF1 to be consistent with lev-
els reported by other NF1 researchers4,10,26 (our sample vs
Huijbregts: t=)0.32, df=41.5, p=0.62; our sample vs Constan-
tino ASD or pervasive developmental disorders: t=)0.064,
df=18.6, p=0.52) and notably higher than unaffected chil-
dren.10,26 The rate of syndromic-level symptoms (‡75) in our
sample (14%) was notably higher than in a previous NF1 ser-
ies (4%)13 and in the general population (1%).27 We found
that 40% of our sample had total reported ASD symptoms
reaching clinically signiﬁcant levels (‡60), suggesting that
these symptoms would be functionally impairing in daily life.
The most common symptoms were in the ‘autistic manner-
isms’ domain (44% of the sample reached clinically signiﬁcant
levels), which includes problems with ﬂexibility and transi-
tions, perseverative behaviors, and being regarded by others as
atypical. Clinically impaired social communication, motiva-
tion, awareness, and cognition were also reported in approxi-
mately 30% of these children. Of clinical relevance, the
presence of ASD symptoms was not related to externalizing
behaviors (e.g. oppositional deﬁant or conduct disordered) or
internalizing symptoms (e.g. anxiety or mood problems). In
fact, we saw a strikingly low rate of these symptoms in our
sample (£3%). Disease severity, at least as indexed by number
of NF1 stigmata, did not explain the increase in ASD symp-
tomatology. This suggests that ASD symptomatology has

Figure 2: Profile plots derived using latent class cluster analysis applied to symptoms of attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), measured by the
Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS) questionnaire, in our cohort of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). VADPRS symptom
profiles are shown in a scale from 1 to 4 (1, never; 2, occasionally; 3, often; 4, very often), whereas sex is shown in a scale from 0 to 1, representing the
proportion of individuals with the characteristic. (a) Inattention (Q1–Q9). Individuals in cluster 1 (n=35, 53%) have minimal ADHD symptoms and are predomi-
nantly male; individuals in cluster 2 (n=20, 30%) present fewer ADHD symptoms and are mostly female; individuals in cluster 3 (n=11, 17%) are mostly inatten-
tive with higher presence of symptoms in Q2, Q4–6, and Q9. (b) Hyperactivity ⁄ impulsivity (Q10–Q18). Individuals belonging to either cluster 1 (n=32, 48%) or
cluster 2 (n=24, 37%) present minimal hyperactivity ⁄ impulsivity ADHD symptoms and are predominantly males, whereas those belonging to cluster 3 (n=10,
15%) are mostly female and present few symptoms, especially in Q10 and Q11. (c) Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (Q19–Q26). To clusters 1 (n=25, 38%)
and 2 (n=25, 38%) belong individuals with NF1 with minimal symptoms of ODD. Individuals in cluster 3 (n=16, 24%) have few symptoms, especially in Q20
and Q21. Males predominantly constitute all clusters. (d) Anxiety and depression (Q41–Q47). Individuals with NF1 belonging to cluster 1 (n=32, 48%) are
predominantly male and present minimal symptoms of anxiety ⁄ depression in all questions. To cluster 2 belong individuals with NF1 in the majority females,
with minimal symptoms of anxiety ⁄ depression in all questions, except in Q41, Q42, and Q47. Cluster 3 (n=11, 17%) groups NF1 patients, mostly males, with
few symptoms of anxiety ⁄ depression and high scores in Q42 and Q47.

been under-recognized and under-studied in NF1, further
supporting the addition of ASD to the neurodevelopmental
risks of NF1.13

Overall, male and female patients with NF1 did not differ
signiﬁcantly. However, detailed examination revealed signiﬁ-
cant differences in the rate of raised social communication and
social motivation symptoms between males and females, with
males exhibiting greater impairment in these domains.

Research has consistently demonstrated the relationship
between ADHD and poor social skills,14 and there is clear
overlap in symptoms of ADHD and ASD.28 Given the high
prevalence of ADHD in individuals with NF1,1–3 and the dif-
ﬁculties in socialization,4 it is important to consider the rela-
tionship between these symptom presentations and how they
might interact. Consistent with previous literature,4,8 we
found a signiﬁcant positive relationship between the presence
of raised ADHD and ASD symptoms in our sample of chil-
dren with NF1. This relationship was particularly salient for
problems with social communication and social cognition.
Although an item analysis is beyond the scope of this paper,
the lack of ability to focus and sustain attention and inhibit
impulsive behaviors most certainly limit a child’s pragmatic
skills (making appropriate eye contact, interpreting non-verbal
cues and tone of voice) and general social awareness (relating
events to one another, social reciprocity).29,30

Taking this relationship further, we were interested in inter-
relationships among groups of symptoms in our patients with
NF1 through cluster analyses. For ADHD symptoms, we
found generally low endorsement of symptoms of hyperactiv-
ity and impulsivity, oppositional or conduct disordered behav-
iors, and anxiety or mood disturbance for both sexes. Instead,
our patients with NF1 exhibited higher symptoms of inatten-
tion, particularly for tasks requiring sustained mental focus
and effort, organization, and task completion.

Because of the signiﬁcant relationship between the presence
of ADHD and ASD symptoms, we sought to understand how
these symptoms tend to present in our sample of children with
NF1. Distinct patterns of symptom clusters emerged. The
presence of attention deﬁcits and hyperactivity co-occurred
speciﬁcally with deﬁcits in social awareness and social motiva-
tion. It makes sense that poor vigilance and impulse control
would be associated with less awareness of social rules and
cues, which can certainly relate to diminished motivation to
socialize. This pattern has been observed in ADHD.14 Social
cognition and autistic mannerisms were independently related
to each other, but not to ADHD symptoms. Interestingly,
social communication deﬁcits were distinct from raised levels
of other ASD symptoms as well as ADHD symptoms, anxiety,
or depression, suggesting that the presence of such limitations
may relate to some other factors or processes not identiﬁed
here, such as general language impairments. Although opposi-
tional behaviors, conduct problems, and anxiety co-occurred
with each other, these were independent of social impairments
or ASD symptomatology.

The strengths of this study include our strategy of sampling
from all children with NF1 referred to the neuroﬁbromatosis
clinic, not only those referred for speciﬁc neurocognitive or

social–emotional concerns. This provided us with a more rep-
resentative sample of the general population of individuals
with NF1. However, given that about half of our families
completed and returned the questionnaires, it remains possible
that the most severely affected individuals were in fact the ones
from whom questionnaires were received, and we do not have
the ability to determine speciﬁcally the differences between
responders and non-responders. Additionally, we had the abil-
ity to evaluate several factors previously shown to relate to
social functioning in children with NF1, speciﬁcally the role
of ADHD symptomatology. Moving forward, a larger pro-
spective approach including criterion-standard quantitative
measures of social cognition and formal diagnosis of ASD
would strengthen our ﬁndings. Additionally, incorporating
larger samples of clinical and healthy comparison groups is
important, as some of our null ﬁndings may have reﬂected
limited power. There are many neurocognitive, social infor-
mation processing, and emotional factors involved in social
competence, and expanding upon this study by evaluating
more of these will probably provide additional clarity in
understanding the social impairments present in individuals
with NF1.

To summarize, we found that in our population of children
with NF1, ASD-related symptoms were common, with
approximately one-third being at risk for clinically signiﬁ-
cant ⁄ functionally impairing levels of these symptoms. The

number of children with NF1 with symptom levels generally
associated with ASD was higher than previously described in
NF1 and much higher than the general population. These
raised levels of symptoms were not explained by disease sever-
ity or by comorbid externalizing or internalizing behavioral
disorders. However, there was a high level of comorbidity
between certain ADHD and ASD symptoms, particularly rela-
tive to social awareness and motivation. The results of this
study imply the need for increased screening for the presence
of impairments in social cognition in children with NF1. Fur-
ther, this presents an opportunity to consider novel targets for
intervention studies aimed at improving peer relationships and
socialization in this population of patients.
