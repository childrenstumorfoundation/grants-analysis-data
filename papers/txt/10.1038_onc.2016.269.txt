Overexpression of PDGFRA cooperates with loss of NF1 and
p53 to accelerate the molecular pathogenesis of malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors
DH Ki1, S He1, S Rodig2 and AT Look1

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, frequently metastatic sarcomas that are associated with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), a prominent inherited genetic disease in humans. Although loss of the NF1 gene predisposes to
MPNST induction, relatively long tumor latency in NF1 patients suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic abnormalities are
needed for the development of these nerve sheath malignancies. To study the molecular pathways contributing to the formation of
MPNSTs in NF1 patients, we used a zebraﬁsh tumor model deﬁned by nf1 loss in a p53-deﬁcient background together with the
overexpression of either wild-type or constitutively activated PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α) under control of
the sox10 neural crest-speciﬁc promoter. Here we demonstrate the accelerated onset and increased penetrance of MPNST
formation in ﬁsh overexpressing both the wild-type and the mutant PDGFRA transgenes in cells of neural crest origin. Interestingly,
overexpression of the wild-type PDGFRA was even more potent in promoting transformation than the mutant PDGFRA, which is
important because ~ 78% of human MPNSTs have expression of wild-type PDGFRA, whereas only 5% harbor activating mutations of
the gene encoding this receptor. Further analysis revealed the induction of cellular senescence in zebraﬁsh embryos overexpressing
mutant, but not wild-type, PDGFRA, suggesting a mechanism through which the oncogenic activity of the mutant receptor is
tempered by the activation of premature cellular senescence in an NF1-deﬁcient background. Taken together, our study suggests a
model in which overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA associated with NF1 deﬁciency leads to aberrant activation of downstream RAS
signaling and thus contributes importantly to MPNST development—a prediction supported by the ability of the kinase inhibitor
sunitinib alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib to retard MPNST progression in transgenic ﬁsh overexpressing
the wild-type receptor.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggres-
sive and often metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas that occur most
frequently in children and young adults with neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 (NF1).1 Indeed, about half of all MPNSTs are diagnosed in
NF1 patients, and MPNSTs represent one of the most common
causes of death in patients who are haploinsufﬁcient for this
gene.2 These nerve sheath tumors are thought to arise from cells
derived from the neural crest, including progenitors of Schwann
cells and perineural cells, which have somatically lost the function
of the remaining NF1 allele.3 The prognosis of patients with
MPNSTs is very poor, with a high recurrence rate after surgical
resection (~40%).4,5 Currently, complete surgical excision is the
only curative therapy for these tumors, but unfortunately they are
often not completely resectable. The available chemotherapy

regimens are for

improved understanding of MPNST
pathogenesis and the identiﬁcation of new molecular pathways
on which these tumors are dependent is urgently needed to
improve treatment outcome in NF1 patients who develop
malignant nerve sheath tumors. Hopefully, new insights into

life. Therefore,

pathogenesis will implicate potential therapeutic targets for the
development of small-molecule drugs with more potent and
speciﬁc antitumor activity.

Patients with NF1 have only one functional copy of the NF1
gene, which encodes neuroﬁbromin, a protein of more than 2800
amino acids.6 Neuroﬁbromin contains a small region of homology
to the RAS GAP protein and is capable of downregulating RAS
activity by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP-bound RAS to its
inactive GDP-bound form.7 Thus, when the remaining functional
allele of NF1 is lost somatically in nonmyelinating Schwann cell
progenitors,
the NF1-null progeny acquire aberrant growth
properties leading to benign neuroﬁbromas.8,9 These benign
neuroﬁbromas can occur in association with cutaneous nerves in
the form of dermal neuroﬁbromas, often causing cosmetic
disﬁguration. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas are a more serious second
type of neuroﬁbroma that form in association with more internal
nerve bundles. In this type of neuroﬁbroma, other cell types are
recruited, including ﬁbroblasts, perineural cells, endothelial cells
and mast cells. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas
invade soft-tissue
structures and bone, often causing signiﬁcant functional impair-
location.10 Even though plexiform
ment depending on their
neuroﬁbromas are benign tumors, they are often unresectable

because they involve multiple layers of tissues with essential
functions. About 10% of plexiform neuroﬁbromas undergo
malignant transformation into MPNSTs,11 often arising from cells
with the additional acquired loss of the CDKN2A or TP53 tumor
suppressor genes.12

The absence or latency of MPNST development in many NF1
patients suggests that additional gene mutations are needed to
induce tumorigenesis. One promising candidate is platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA), a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK). Overexpression and chromosomal ampliﬁcation of
the
PDGFRA gene have been reported in MPNSTs,13,14 and this gene
was one of the most overexpressed in an analysis of paired benign
plexiform neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs,15 suggesting that this RTK
may be upregulated as part of the benign-to-malignant tumor
transition. Moreover, PDGFRA is frequently active and phosphory-
lated in MPNSTs from patients.16,17 Both PDGFRA and its ligand,
PDGF-A, are overexpressed together in human MPNST cells,16
suggesting that PDGF-A ligand acts in an autocrine manner in
human MPNSTs to support growth. Paracrine stimulation also
supports MPNST growth because Schwann cells derived from
nf1− / − mice express growth factor ligands such as PDGF-B, unlike
those derived from nf1+/+ mice.18 Overall, both autocrine and
paracrine activation of the PDGF receptor seem to be responsible
for accelerating human MPNST formation. Taken together, these
ﬁndings justify a more comprehensive investigation of the role of
PDGFRA in the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs in patients with
loss of the NF1 gene. This imperative gains impetus from reports
that RTK inhibitors targeting PDGFRA decrease the growth and
invasion rates of MPNST cell lines.16,19

We previously reported that zebraﬁsh with loss-of-function
mutations of p53 develop MPNST,20 reiterating the observation of
p53 loss in human MPNST.21 Thus, to discover the molecular
pathways contributing to the formation of MPNSTs in NF1
patients, we generated an NF1 mutant zebraﬁsh model and used
it
to demonstrate that a combination of nf1 loss and p53
deﬁciency potentiates the penetrance and onset of MPNSTs.22
To better understand the molecular and cellular determinants of
NF1-associated MPNST pathogenesis in vivo, we established stable
transgenic lines with overexpression of both wild-type and
constitutively active mutant of human PDGFRA, using the
MPNST-prone zebraﬁsh line with loss of both p53 and nf1.
We report here that MPNST onset is accelerated by PDGFRA
overexpression. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA
was more active in accelerating MPNST initiation than was
mutationally activated PDGFRA in our transgenic zebraﬁsh model,
possibly because mutationally active PDGFRA induces senescence
in nf1/p53 compound mutant cells. Thus, our study implicates
overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA as a key driver in MPNST,
which is important because wild-type PDGFRA is frequently
documented in human MPNST, whereas mutational activation of
the gene is rare. This is a key consideration when implementing
targeted therapy, because it indicates that PDGFRA inhibitors are
likely to have antiproliferative activity in the large subset of
MPNSTs with overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA.

RESULTS
I-SceI meganuclease-mediated PDGFRA transgenesis in nf1- and
p53-deﬁcient ﬁsh
To understand the role of PDGFRA in MPNST pathogenesis, we
cloned the cDNA encoding either wild-type or constitutively
activated human PDGFRA (exons 8 and 9 deleted)23 under control
of the zebraﬁsh sox10 neural crest-speciﬁc promoter (Figure 1a).
A sox10:mCherry cDNA construct was coinjected with each sox10:
PDGFR construct into nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m zebraﬁsh, based on
studies showing that three separate transgene constructs will
cointegrate into the host genome after coinjection into the

one-cell-stage zebraﬁsh embryo.24 Hence,
the expression of
mCherry serves as a marker for the coexpression of PDGFRA in
tissues of the mosaic primary injected animals.

At maturity 3 months after injection, the primary injected
animals were outbred to establish stable transgenic lines with
overexpression of either wild-type or mutant PDGFRA in nf1a+/ − ;
nf1b−/−; p53m/m zebraﬁsh. To conﬁrm the presence of the human
PDGFRA gene in zebraﬁsh DNA, we performed PCR with the
extracted total DNA from individual embryos of the stable lines,
detecting the human wild-type PDGFRA (740 bp) and mutant
(497 bp) PCR bands (Figures 1b and c). In the stable transgenic
lines, the mCherry ﬂuorescence, driven by the sox10 promoter, is
expressed in cells of neural crest origin during early embryogen-
esis (Figures 1d and e).25

these cells

Hyperplasia of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and
decreased lateral stripe melanophores have been reported in our
previous study with nf1 mutant zebraﬁsh.22 We examined whether
PDGFRA overexpression affects
(Supplementary
Figure S1). In these results, 6 days post fertilization (d.p.f.) embryos
from both wild-type and mutant PDGFRA transgenic lines
demonstrated increased numbers of sox10:mCherry-positive OPCs
in the spinal cord. Embryos transgenic for mutant PDGFRA had the
most marked increase in OPCs, with approximately twice the
number of
sox10:mCherry-positive OPCs compared with the
mCherry control transgenic larvae in the nf1a+/+; nf1b−/−; p53m/m
background. Decreased lateral stripe melanophores were identi-
ﬁed in our current study in the nf1a+/+; nf1b−/−; p53m/m
background, similar to results we reported previously,22 and there
was no detectable difference among the mCherry control, wild-
type and mutant PDGFRA transgenic zebraﬁsh. We did not observe
any additional developmental defects in the PDGFRA transgenic
zebraﬁsh embryos.

Both wild-type and constitutively activated mutant forms of
PDGFRA accelerate MPNST tumorigenicity in nf1- and p53-
deﬁcient ﬁsh
We performed tumor watches using both mosaic primary injected
ﬁsh and established stable transgenic lines, and found that both
wild-type and constitutively activated mutant PDGFRA transgenes
accelerated MPNST tumorigenesis and increased tumor pene-
trance in nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m zebraﬁsh (Figures 2a and b). In
primary injectants, both wild-type and mutant PDGFRA-injected
zebraﬁsh developed mCherry-positive tumors much earlier and
more frequently than in mCherry control ﬁsh (Figure 2a).
In
PDGFRA mutant injectants, tumor onset began at 20 weeks post
fertilization (w.p.f.), whereas in those PDGFRA injected with wild-
type, they began to form at 25 w.p.f., and mCherry-only control
transgenic ﬁsh developed tumors from 31 weeks.
Interestingly,
both wild-type and PDGFRA mutant injectants showed higher
penetrance rates than did mCherry control zebraﬁsh (71.4% and
55.6% vs 27.3% at 40 w.p.f). These results in the primary injectants
show that both wild-type and constitutively activated PDGFRA
overexpression cooperate with loss of nf1 and p53 function to
accelerate the onset and increase the penetrance of
tumor
formation.
In these stable transgenic lines derived from outbreeding the
primary injectants, including Tg(nf1a+/ 

stable ﬁsh lines, the tumor onset times and penetrance patterns
associated with both the wild-type and mutant forms of PDGFRA
were similar to those of the mosaic PDGFRA wild-type and mutant
injectants, reﬂecting a faster growth rate of tumors overexpressing
wild-type compared with constitutively activated PDGFRA. Tumors
in the wild-type PDGFRA-overexpressing ﬁsh,
arose at 18 w.p.f.
with 89.3% of
this group developing MPNSTs by 30 w.p.f.

mutant had sizes of 740 and 497 bp, respectively. Injected plasmids for transgenesis were used as the positive control. (d and e) Sox10

zebraﬁsh embryo at 3 d.p.f. showed mCherry expression throughout otic vesicle (OV), branchial arches (BA), oligodendrocytes (O), jaw
cartilage (JC) and pectoral ﬁns (PF).

Transgenic PDGFRA mutant zebraﬁsh began to show tumors by
20 w.p.f., with 48.3% developing tumors by 30 w.p.f. This contrasts
with the lack of onset of tumors in the mCherry control zebraﬁsh
until 24 w.p.f., and a tumor penetrance rate of 22.8% at 30 w.p.f.
These ﬁndings reinforce the status of PDGFRA as a key driver of
tumorigenesis in MPNST. The faster development of tumors in
PDGFRA wild-type overexpressors compared with PDGFRA mutant
ﬁsh was surprising,
likely reﬂecting optimal PDGFRA tyrosine
kinase activity when the wild-type receptor is overexpressed
as opposed to constitutive activation of
the PDGFRA gene.
Apparently, the constitutively activated mutant PDGFRA is so
active in an nf1/p53-deﬁcient background that it actually reduces
tumor cell growth by inducing cellular senescence (see below and
Figures 4d–l). This interpretation also agrees with reports that
human MPNST samples often show high levels of PDGFRA
expression without any mutation in the PDGFRA coding
sequence.16

The sox10 promoter is highly expressed in MPNST,26,27 and thus
transgenic sox10:mCherry (Figures 2c and d),
sox10:mcherry/
PDGFRA wild-type (Figures 2e and f) and sox10:mcherry/PDGFRA
mutant (Figures 2g and h) zebraﬁsh developed tumors with strong
mCherry expression. Evaluation of the induced zebraﬁsh MPNSTs

for PDGFRA expression demonstrated expression of human
PDGFRAs in protein lysates prepared from tumors of ﬁsh
transgenic for wild-type and mutant PDGFRAs (Figure 2i). Their
phosphorylated (active) forms were also detected. Interestingly, a
phosphoprotein with the same mobility as human PDGFRA was
detected in mCherry control tumor lysates, suggesting that the
endogenous zebraﬁsh receptor tyrosine kinase is activated during
the molecular pathogenesis of zebraﬁsh MPNST.

PDGFRA-induced zebraﬁsh MPNSTs exhibit similar histology to
that of human MPNSTs
To examine the histology of the induced tumors in our transgenic
zebraﬁsh, we performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
The results were consistent with the diagnostic histologic features
of human MPNST: spindle-shaped cells with long serpentine-like
nuclei that stack into short fascicles, typically organized into
whorls (Figures 3a–c).

We also examined the expression of two neural crest cell
lineage markers, S100 and Sox10, in our zebraﬁsh MPNST tumors,
as these are used diagnostically to distinguish human MPNST from
other types of solid tumors.26,27 Both S100 (Figures 3d–f) and

background induced tumors that strongly expressed mCherry protein (430 w.p.f., scale bar = 10 mm). (i) Western blot analysis for PDGFRA in
protein lysates prepared from tumors of mCherry control, PDGFRA wild-type and PDGFRA mutant ﬁsh. PDGFRA wild-type, mutant and their
phosphorylated (active) forms were detected. β-Tubulin was used an internal control for equal loading. Arrow denotes protein size (kDa).

Sox10 (Figures 3g–i) were expressed by tumor cells in samples of
tumors arising in each of our transgenic lines. S100 is localized in
the cell membrane and nucleus, whereas Sox10 is only detected in
the nucleus. The histopathologic features were identical to those
in MPNSTs arising in the nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m line expressing
mCherry, and in ﬁsh with the same background mutations but
expressing the wild-type or mutant PDGFRA transgene.

Additionally, we performed immunohistochemical staining to
identify which cells and tissues expressed PDGFRA in adult
zebraﬁsh (Supplementary Figure S2). Endogenous PDGFRA was
expressed in many adult zebraﬁsh tissues such as brain, gill and
oocytes. MPNST tumor cells from sox10:mCherry, wild-type and
mutant PDGFRA zebraﬁsh lines each also expressed detectable
PDGFRA. The mutant PDGFRA protein is predominately expressed
in the cytosol, as noted previously.23

Overexpression of the PDGFRA wild-type gene activates AKT and
ERK at levels optimal for tumorigenicity
We expected that PDGFRA overexpression and activation of its
tyrosine kinase domain would activate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate 3 kinase and Ras downstream signals in neural crest
origin cells, and consequently would accelerate MPNST tumor-
igenicity. To test this prediction, we performed western blot

analysis for AKT and ERK1/2 activation in protein lysates prepared
from tumors of mCherry control, wild-type PDGFRA and PDGFRA
mutant ﬁsh. Both AKT and ERK1/2 were phosphorylated in all
types of primary MPNST lysates (Figure 4a). However,
the
phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the lysate of the
PDGFRA mutant tumor were higher compared with those of
the mCherry control and PDGFRA wild-type tumors. The mean
values for the phosphorylated (p)-AKT/AKT and p-ERK/ERK ratios in
the PDGFRA mutant were 3.68- and 3.10-fold higher, respectively,
compared with that for the mCherry control (Figures 4b and c),
whereas the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK1/2 in the
lysates of mCherry and PDGFRA wild-type tumors were similar.
Because the PDGFRA mutant tumors grow more slowly than
PDGFRA wild-type tumors, our ﬁndings suggest that the wild-type
PDGFRA may activate Ras downstream signals at levels optimal for
MPNST tumorigenicity, whereas the PDGFRA mutant may transmit
a stronger than optimal signal.

PDGFRA mutant overexpressors showed senescence-associated
β-galactosidase activity
We hypothesized that excessive activation of Ras signaling by the
mutant PDGFRA receptor might induce senescence in a subset

staining of the zebraﬁsh MPNSTs was identical in the nf1a+/ − ; nf1b− / −; p53m/m zebraﬁsh when either PDGFRA wild-type or mutant proteins
were overexpressed. In each genotype, the zebraﬁsh MPNST histopathology was very similar to that of human MPNSTs. The zebraﬁsh MPNSTs
comprise spindle cells that stack into short fascicles, typically with a whirling organization pattern. MPNST cells have long serpentine-like
nuclei and are spindle-shaped. (d–i) Markers of cells of neural crest origin were expressed by the zebraﬁsh MPNST tumors, such as S100 (d–f)
and Sox10 (g–i). S100 was detected in the cell membrane and nucleus, whereas Sox10 was detected in the nucleus. Scale bar = 200 μm.

levels

tumorigenesis during development. To test this hypothesis, we
checked senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity of the
cells in our zebraﬁsh model at 4 d.p.f. In this result, the PDGFRA
mutant overexpressors in nf1- and p53-deﬁcient background
senescence-associated β-galactosidase
showed higher
activity than did the wild-type PDGFRA overexpressors or controls
(Figures 4d, g and j).
In transverse sections of the embryos,
senescence-associated β-galactosidase-stained cells coincided
with or were adjacent to Sox10-expressing mCherry-positive cells
within the ventral neural tube of transgenic ﬁsh overexpressing
the PDGFRA mutant cDNA (Figures 4e, f, h, i, k and l). This result
suggests that overexpression of the PDGFRA mutant in cells of
neural crest origin may induce senescence through hyperstimula-
tion of Ras signaling. Senescent cells become postmitotic, so this
process would delay the onset and retard the growth of MPNST
tumors in the PDGFRA mutant animals.

Furthermore, to detect senescence in MPNSTs derived from
wild-type or mutant PDGFRA transgenic zebraﬁsh, we performed
β-galactosidase staining of the cryosectioned tumor tissues. We
also examined ﬁbrosis in both groups of
tumors with the
trichrome stain and antibodies to detect collagen I expression.
Additionally, CD31 expression levels were assessed in the
cryosectioned tumor tissues.

Sunitinib retards primary MPNST progression in wild-type PDGFRA
transgenic ﬁsh
To test whether inhibition of PDGFRA and other tyrosine kinase
receptors would affect tumor cell growth and survival, we treated
sox10:PDGFRA wild-type transgenic MPNST ﬁsh with the RTK
inhibitor, sunitinib for 10 days (2 μM sunitinib or dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) in ﬁsh water).
In the adults, the drug was effectively

absorbed by the gills and transported to the tumor cells and
normal cells through the blood. Comparison of mCherry expres-
sion by the tumor pretreatment and post-treatment tumor area
indicated retarded tumor cell growth in the sunitinib-treated ﬁsh
(Figures 5a–l). Sunitinib-treated PDGFRA wild-type transgenic ﬁsh
showed an average tumor growth of 11% over 10 days, compared
with 300% growth over 10 days in the DMSO-treated ﬁsh
(Figure 5m).

Sunitinib promotes apoptosis of MPNST cells of PDGFRA wild-type
transgenic ﬁsh
To study how sunitinib treatment leads to tumor shrinkage, we
ﬁrst examined the histopathology of the DMSO- or sunitinib-
treated ﬁsh after H&E staining (Figures 6a–h). The sunitinib-treated
tumors showed areas of necrosis (Figures 6c, d and g, h), with the
necrotic centers surrounded by MPNST cells, whereas areas of
necrosis were not detected in the DMSO control
tumors
(Figures 6a, b and e, f). We also performed proliferating cell
nuclear antigen and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining to assess
proliferation and apoptosis, respectively (Figures 6i–l and m–p).
Positive staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen was
observed in both the DMSO- and the sunitinib-treated MPNSTs
at about the same levels, with the positive immunostaining of
cleaved caspase-3 observed only in the cell nuclei of tumors in the
sunitinib-treated MPNSTs. This result suggests that sunitinib
retards the progression of primary MPNSTs by inducing apoptotic
cell death rather than by simply inhibiting cell proliferation.

drug treatment. Successfully implanted embryos were incubated
with drugs for 3 days (Figure 7g). Both trametinib and sunitinib
alone were able to signiﬁcantly suppress MPNST cell growth
compared with the DMSO control group. Our results show marked
potentiation of cell killing in embryos receiving sunitinib plus
trametinib, compared with sunitinib alone (Figures 7i–n). These
results support
that RTK-RAS-MAPK signaling is
hyperactivated in nf1-deﬁcient zebraﬁsh, and thus direct inhibi-
tion of MEK is able to synergize with the RTK inhibitory activity of
sunitinib to improve the response of MPNST tumor cells in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Here we compare the consequences of overexpression of wild-
type and mutant PDGFRA on the onset and penetrance of MPNSTs
arising in our nf1- and p53-deﬁcient zebraﬁsh model. Relying on
the sox10 promoter to overexpress wild-type and mutant PDGFRA
in cells of neural crest origin, we demonstrate that PDGFRA
overexpression accelerates MPNST tumorigenicity in zebraﬁsh.
Surprisingly, overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA was even more
active in promoting the development of MPNST than was
overexpression of a constitutively activated mutant PDGFRA in
the nf1- and p53- deﬁcient background (see Figures 2a and b). This
observation has considerable clinical importance, because PDGFRA
is frequently expressed at high levels in primary human MPNSTs,
but it is only rarely mutated in these tumors.16 Our results
implicate this high level of expression of the wild-type receptor in
pathogenesis, which is difﬁcult to infer in the absence of evidence
from an animal model.
In addition, our studies show that
inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity with sunitinib in tumors
arising in animals transgenic for the wild-type receptor is active in
inducing apoptosis and delaying tumor growth, suggesting
dependence on this pathway for maintenance as well as for the
initiation of MPNST, and suggesting a role for this drug in the
management of tumors that overexpress the wild-type receptor.

Oncogene (2017) 1058 – 1068

Mutational activation of PDGFRA is common in many types of
cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors,29,30 myeloproli-
ferative malignancies associated with hypereosinophilia31–33 and
glioblastoma.23,34 Most of these mutations act by promoting
dimerization of the receptors in the absence of ligand, resulting in
activation of the receptor’s intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.35
However, PDGFRA mutations in human MPNSTs are relatively rare,
despite evidence of high levels of expression of the receptor and
increased DNA copy number for the region surrounding the
location of the gene.14,16 Our studies suggest that this is because
overexpression of constitutively active mutant PDGFRA induces
excessive levels of oncogenic stress in NF1-deﬁcient Schwann cell
precursors, resulting in premature cell senescence.36–38 It would
appear that high levels of wild-type PDGFRA expression are
sufﬁcient to promote dimerization of a subset of the receptors on
the cell surface by mass action, and that this relatively modest
level of tyrosine kinase signaling is optimal to promote malignant
transformation of NF1 deﬁant Schwann cells.

A second possibility is that other oncogenic signals activated by
wild-type PDGFRA may be involved in MPNST development. Clarke
et al.23 reported that wild-type PDGFRA and exon 8- and 9-deleted
mutant forms were differently localized in cells, with the mutants
mainly expressed in cell cytosol and the wild-type form in the cell
membrane. Because many cell signals are precisely regulated
through receptors and transporters on the cell membrane,
changes in the localization of PDGFRA may affect the outcome
of RTK-related cell signaling such as calcium regulation, endocy-
tosis and focal adhesion.39–41 Thus, signaling through the correctly
localized wild-type PDGFRA may produce optimal signals for
MPNST initiation.

The Sox10 protein is a neural crest transcription factor that is
active in the differentiation of Schwann cell precursors.42 In our
previous study, we conﬁrmed that GFP driven by the sox10
promoter is strongly expressed in OPCs and Schwann cells,22 so
that this promoter is ideal for driving gene expression in this
lineage. Moreover, the tumor cells themselves express Sox10

The constitutively active form of PDGFRA that we used for this
study was ﬁrst identiﬁed in human high-grade gliomas,23 and
possesses an in-frame deletion (exons 8 and 9) in the extracellular
domain. We previously reported two cases of high-grade gliomas
in the nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m-stable zebraﬁsh line, and these
tumor cells expressed Sox10.22 In our current study, we identiﬁed
one high-grade glioma in a ﬁsh transgenic for the sox10:PDGFRA
(Supplementary Figure S3), but we did not observe
mutant
accelerated onset or increased penetrance of high-grade gliomas
in the PDGFRA transgenic zebraﬁsh. We are not sure why this
promoter–receptor combination was not active in promoting the
pathogenesis of high-grade gliomas in the zebraﬁsh model.
The sox10-mCherry expression is clearly visible in the brains of the
transgenic ﬁsh, but it is possible that the sox10 promoter is not
expressed early enough in the central nervous system glial lineage
to drive the transformation of glial stem and progenitor cells.
Alternatively, the central nervous system glial cells may be more
susceptible to cell senescence induced by the PDGFRA transgenes,

although we do not observe increased β-gal staining in the central
nervous system of these ﬁsh.

In a previous study, PDGFRA was expressed in 75% of human
primary MPNSTs and MPNST cell lines,16 and overexpression of
epidermal growth factor receptor together with p53 or pten
mutations increased MPNST development in mouse models.43,44
Our study supports the hypothesis that wild-type PDGFRA
overexpression accelerates the onset of MPNST development
and would be sensitive to inhibition in MPNST patients. In human
MPNSTs, Zietsch et al.13 reported that the cell line S462 harbors
the 4q12 amplicon (PDGFRA, KIT and KDR genes) and is sensitive to
sunitinib, with an IC50 (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration)
below 1.0 μM. Moreover, sunitinib induced apoptosis and pre-
vented PDGFRA downstream signaling in response to the ligand,
PDGF-AA. Holtkamp et al.16 also reported that PDGFRA in the S462
cell line is phosphorylated in response PDGF-AA. In addition, Aoki
et al.19 has shown that cell invasion by the human MPNST cell
lines, FU-SFT8611 and FU-SFT9817, is increased in response to the
PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB ligands. Based on these results, we believe
the role of PDGFRA in MPNST growth is evolutionarily conserved
and that our zebraﬁsh model faithfully represents human MPNSTs.
Our
results showing measurable activities of sunitinib and
trametinib appear to accurately reﬂect the sensitivity of the

human disease. In future studies with our MPNST model, it will be
important to test other RTK inhibitors such as imatinib, pazopanib
and sorafenib. The ideal properties of the zebraﬁsh system for
evaluating the activity of drugs administered into the ﬁsh water or
delivered by daily oral gavage suggest that this system may be
ideal for identifying drugs that can synergize with sunitinib to
yield much more substantial
levels of tumor cell killing. For
example, others have reported activity of MEK28 and BET45
inhibitors in human MPNSTs and further investigation revealed
that the MEK inhibitor trametinib enhanced antitumor effects of
sunitinib in vivo (see Figure 7). Assays in the zebraﬁsh may be one
of the best ways to test combinations of three or more drugs
in vivo at multiple dose levels in preclinical studies to guide the
development of clinical trials for this disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Zebraﬁsh lines
The nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m zebraﬁsh line22 was used for injections to
generate the sox10:PDGFRA wild-type and mutant and sox10:mCherry
transgenic lines. Zebraﬁsh were maintained under standard conditions as
described previously.46 All experiments involving zebraﬁsh were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute.

DNA constructs for transgenesis
The 7 kb promoter region of the sox10 gene was ampliﬁed by PCR from a
zebraﬁsh promoter construct kindly provided by Dr Robert N Kelsh,25 and
subcloned into vectors to drive the expression of several genes, including
Tg(sox10:mCherry), Tg(sox10:PDGFRA wild-type) and Tg(sox10:PDGFRA
mutant) in tissues normally expressing the sox10 gene. The wild-type
and mutant PDGFRA cDNAs were provided by Dr Eric C Holland.47 Embryos
were injected with these DNA constructs at the one-cell stage and grown
to adulthood. Fin clips from the offspring were genotyped for the stable
integration and germline transmission of the transgenes. The Tg(sox10:
mCherry), Tg(sox10:PDGFRA wild-type) and Tg(sox10:PDGFRA mutant)
zebraﬁsh lines are designated the ‘mCherry',
‘wild-type PDGFRA’ and
‘PDGFRA mutant’ transgenic line in this article, respectively.

Genotyping assays
To extract genomic DNA, embryos or tail clips were placed in clean PCR
tubes and 40 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.3% Tween-
20, 0.3% NP40, 1 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to each tube. The PCR
tubes incubated at 55 °C for 2 h to overnight, depending on the size of the
sample, and then the tubes were heated to 95 °C for 15 min for the
proteinase K inactivation. Using 2 μl of the lysate as a PCR template, PCR
reaction was performed with NEB Taq DNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA,
USA; M0273) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers
(forward) 5′-
used for human PDGFRA ampliﬁcation were as follows:
ATCAAACCCACCTTCAGCCA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-TCAATGACCCTCCAGCGAAT
-3′. PCR was started at 95 °C for 2 min and then underwent 40 cycles of
95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 45 s. For nf1a, nf1b and p53, we
used protocols described previously.20,22,48

Tumor watch of transgenic ﬁsh

masses indicative of tumors.
In addition, for Figure 2a, either human
wild-type or mutant PDGFRAs were overexpressed in nf1- and p53-deﬁcient
ﬁsh as mosaics by coinjecting the following constructs into the one-cell
stage of nf1- and p53-deﬁcient embryos: (1) sox10:PDGFRA wild-type with
sox10:mCherry; (2) sox10:PDGFRA mutant with sox10:mCherry; or (3) sox10:
mCherry alone. The primary injectants were raised and monitored for the
onset of
tumorigenesis as described above. Fish with tumors were
separated and analyzed further by H&E staining and immunohistochemical
assays.

Western blotting
Protein lysates were prepared with mCherry expressed tumors from
nf1a+/ − ; nf1b−/−; p53m/m ﬁsh. Brieﬂy, mCherry-positive tumor mass were
harvested from tricaine-anesthetized tumor ﬁsh, and were lysed on ice in
1 × RIPA (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) containing, PhosSTOP
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche,
IN, USA) and
complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). The inhibitors were prepared
following the manufacturer’s recommendation. Protein lysates were
separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membranes and
probed overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-
PDGFRA (Cell Signaling; 5241; 1:500), anti-p-tyrosine (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA; 05-321; 1:1000), anti-β-tubulin (Cell Signaling 2146;
1:2000), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling; 9272; 1:1000), anti-p-AKT (Cell Signaling;
4060; 1:1000), anti-p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 4377;1:1000) and anti-ERK1/2
(Cell Signaling; 9102; 1:1000). Primary antibody binding was visualized on
X-ray ﬁlm using anti-mouse-HRP (Cell Signaling; 7076; 1:10 000) or
anti-rabbit-HRP (Cell Signaling; 7074; 1:10 000) secondary antibodies along
with SuperSignal West Dura or Femto (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA) chemiluminescent substrates. Stripping was performed using
Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining
The Senescence-Associated β-Galactosidase Detection Kit
(CS0030;
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used for ﬁsh embryo senescence
detection according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, ﬁsh embryos at
4 d.p.f. were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, and were
washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 1 h each.
After washing, the embryos were incubated with the senescence staining
mixture for 24 h at 37 °C. The experiment was performed in duplicate.

Parafﬁn sectioning, cryosectioning and immunostaining
Fish were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn
blocks for parafﬁn sectioning. Sections were immunostained by conven-
tional protocols49 using antibodies against S100 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA,
USA; Z0311; 1:1000), Sox10 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA; GTX128374; 1:1000),
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (EMD Millipore; NA03; 1:50) and cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling 9664; 1:125). Cryosectioning of β-galactosidase-
stained embryos was performed as described previously.50

Drug treatment
Wild-type PDGFRA expressed tumor ﬁsh were exposed to 2 μM sunitinib
(LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA; S-8803) or DMSO added to the ﬁsh
water. The tumor ﬁsh were fed with dry food (GEMMA Micro 300; Skretting,
Tooele, UT, USA) every other day. The ﬁsh water was exchanged with fresh
water (containing sunitinib or DMSO) 2 h after feeding. After 10 days of
treatment, quantitative assessment of the remaining tumor was measured
using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) for each treated tumor
ﬁsh. Embryos were treated with sunitinib, trametinib (Selleck, Houston, TX,
USA; GSK1120212) or a combination of both for 3 days under dark
conditions.

Embryonic implantation assay
Primary MPNST cells derived from wild-type PDGFRA expressed tumor ﬁsh
were injected into the yolk sac of each embryo (roy and nacre double
homozygous mutant; casper
line) at 2 d.p.f. Successfully implanted
embryos were collected and randomly distributed into the well of a
12-well plate, and incubated with either DMSO or drugs for 3 days at 28 °C.
After drug treatment for 3 days, each embryo was imaged, and tumor area
was quantitated using the ImageJ software (NIH). For further details about
the implantation, see Supplementary Information.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5 software (GraphPad,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Kaplan–Meier methods and the log-rank test were
applied to assess the rate of tumor development in Figure 2. The exact
sample size is indicated in each ﬁgure and legend. A two-tailed unpaired t-
test was used for the analysis in Figure 4 and data were plotted along with
the standard deviation. A two-tailed unpaired t-test was also used for the
analysis in Figure 5. For the experiment shown in Figure 7, the power to
detect a 50% decrease in tumor cells with an agent compared with DMSO

is 91% when nine embryos are tested per condition, assuming that if the
mean signal is reduced by 50%, the standard deviation is also reduced by
50%, so at least nine embryos were tested at each condition. The largest
and smallest values for each condition were removed from analysis as
outliers according to the pre-established criteria, and the median values
are shown in Figure 7. A two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for the
analysis of signiﬁcance in Figure 7. After drug treatment, digital images
were recorded of the ﬂuorescence signal for every embryo and the area of
the ﬂuorescence signal was measured quantitatively using the ImageJ
software (NIH). The variance of the area of mCherry expression in the
embryos was calculated for each group and shown to be within 30% of the
DMSO control embryos. If the standard deviation for speciﬁc compounds
varies by 430% from the DMSO control embryos, and then we would test
for signiﬁcance using the Welch t-test. Embryos were injected without
randomization for this experiment. The investigators were not blinded to
the experimental group.
