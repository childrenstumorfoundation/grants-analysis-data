Abstract

The formation and maintenance of an organism is highly dependent on the orderly control of cell 
growth, differentiation, death, and migration. These processes are tightly regulated by signaling 
cascades in which a limited number of molecules dictate these cellular events. While these 
signaling pathways are highly conserved across species and cell types, the functional outcomes 
that result from their engagement are specified by the context in which they are activated. Using 
the Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome as an illustrative platform, we 
discuss how NF1/RAS signaling can create functional diversity at multiple levels (molecular, 
cellular, tissue, and genetic/genomic). As such, the ability of related molecules (e.g., K-RAS, H-
RAS) to activate distinct effectors, as well as cell type- and tissue-specific differences in molecular 
composition and effector engagement, generate numerous unique functional effects. These 
variations, coupled with a multitude of extracellular cues and genomic/genetic changes that each 
modify the innate signaling properties of the cell, enable precise control of cellular physiology in 
both health and disease. Understanding these contextual influences is important when trying to 
dissect the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of cancer relevant to molecularly-targeted 
therapeutics.

1. Introduction

“The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my 
measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old 
measurements and expect me to fit them.”

- George Bernard Shaw

Precise control of cell behavior involves continual sensing of a variety of physical and 
chemical cues from the external milieu, and interpreting those signals to respond in an 
appropriate manner. These extracellular cues take the form of cell-bound and diffusible 
ligands that bind specific receptors on cells to initiate a cascade of signaling events that 
culminate in changes in protein function through post-translational (e.g., phosphorylation) or 
transcriptional (e.g., mRNA or miRNA) alterations. In this regard, signaling represents the 
language of the cell, where molecules (words) and cellular context (syntax) serve as units of 
informational content. Creating meaningful sentences and paragraphs requires that a limited 
number of molecules can be used in combinatorial and situation-specific manners to produce 
a diversity of outputs and responses relevant to the specific environment at that particular 
time. Unfortunately, when we study signaling pathways in normal cells or in the setting of 
cancer, we often fail to consider how the cellular language conferred by these pathways is 
influenced by context, that is, the different extracellular signals present in the immediate 
milieu, the various adaptive responses that limit and promote intracellular signal 
transduction, the innate properties of distinct cell types responding to these cues, and the 
impact of epigenetic/genomic changes on the ultimate consequence of these informational 
signals. In this review, we use the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) predisposition syndrome 
as an illustrative platform to discuss how heterogeneity can be generated at the molecular, 
cellular, tissue, and genomic/genetic levels. Moreover, we suggest that the precision created 
by this “contextual signaling” enables diverse outcomes to arise from engagement of a 
limited number of key signaling pathways.

1.1 Neurofibromatosis type 1

Page 3

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome affecting 1 in every 2,500 
individuals worldwide. Caused by a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, affected children 
and adults are prone to the development of benign and malignant tumors. In addition, 
numerous other organ systems are affected, leading to skeletal, cardiovascular, dermatologic, 
ophthalmologic, endocrinologic, and neurological abnormalities. This latter group of clinical 
features is the most common, and includes peripheral nerve tumors (neurofibromas and 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors) and brain tumors (optic pathway and brainstem 
gliomas, malignant glioma).

Neurofibromas and optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) form following bi-allelic NF1 loss, 
which is the consequence of somatic inactivation of the remaining normal NF1 gene and 
total loss of NF1 protein (neurofibromin) expression. Individuals with NF1 start life with a 
germline NF1 gene mutation, which increases their chance of cancer, since only one 
additional genetic event is required (somatic NF1 gene loss). As neurofibromin functions as 
a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to accelerate the conversion of active GTP-bound rat 
sarcoma (RAS) to inactive RAS-GDP, neurofibromin loss in neoplastic cells leads to RAS 
hyperactivation and engagement of multiple RAS downstream effectors, culminating in 
increased cell growth. In addition, tumorigenesis is further controlled by non-neoplastic cells 
in the local microenvironment that elaborate key stromal growth factors and chemokines. 
Moreover, the impact of NF1 loss is highly dependent on the specific cell type and tissue, as 
well as by modifying genomic loci and cooperating genetic mutations. The influence of all 
of these factors may partly explain why individuals with NF1 exhibit such a wide range of 
clinical variability. In this regard, children and adults from the same family with an identical 
germline NF1 gene mutation can manifest different medical features of NF1 and have 
markedly distinct clinical courses and severity. Understanding these factors is vitally 
important for providing risk assessments to affected individuals, as well as for designing 
personalized therapies for these clinical abnormalities when they develop.

2. Molecular Level

While neurofibromin functions as a RAS-GAP, the consequence of bi-allelic NF1 loss on 
signaling pathway activation and cell growth is not identical in all cell types. This reflects 
the fact that a signaling molecule (e.g., RAS) is not a single molecule, but rather comprises a 
family of highly homologous proteins with slightly different functions. Moreover, RAS can 
signal by engaging a variety of downstream effector proteins to control cell biology. Lastly, 
some signaling effector proteins function as part of a multi-molecular complex whose 
composition determines which signaling intermediates are activated and what cellular output 
is controlled (Figure 1).

2.1 Signaling molecules comprise a group of functionally-distinct proteins

One mechanism by which RAS pathway activation can generate distinct cellular responses is 
through differential engagement of RAS/RAS effector proteins. In this regard, RAS, rapidly 
accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) and protein kinase B (AKT) each comprise families of 
molecularly-similar, but functionally-distinct, proteins.

RAS exists as at least four highly homologous RAS proteins (H-RAS, N-RAS, K-RAS4A, 
K-RAS4B), which differ in their potency to activate downstream effectors [1]. While these 
molecules share 85% amino acid sequence similarity, the specific functions of each RAS 
protein are dictated by distinct 25-residue hypervariable regions (HVR) at the carboxyl 
terminus. Differential lipid modifications within this HVR direct H-RAS and N-RAS to the 
plasma membrane, while K-RAS is trafficked to different domains within the plasma 
membrane [2, 3]. In addition, oncogenic K-RAS activation (Noonan syndrome) increases 
cellular proliferation and differentiation, while hyperactive N-RAS (Noonan syndrome) 
promotes cell survival [4]. Similarly, mutational H-RAS activation (Costello syndrome) 
stimulates tumor angiogenesis [5] and DNA synthesis [6], while mutational K-RAS 
activation has no effect [7]. Moreover, homozygous inactivation of K- RAS is embryonically 
lethal, whereas N-RAS or H-RAS knockout mice are viable [8, 9]. Lastly, only mutationally-
activated K-RAS, but not H-RAS or N-RAS, increased neural stem cell proliferation in vitro 
and astroglial differentiation in vitro and in vivo [10].

One of the direct targets of RAS is the RAF serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, which, 
like RAS, comprises three distinct molecules (A-RAF, B-RAF, C-RAF [RAF-1]). These 
proteins are differentially expressed and regulated, and are non-redundant in their ability to 
activate their downstream effectors. RAF molecules, though structurally similar, regulate 
MEK1/2 with varied affinity through the formation of multiple RAF heterodimers. In this 
regard, the B-RAF/C-RAF heterodimer stimulates MEK much more efficiently than B-RAF 
or C-RAF activation alone [11]. Additionally, B-RAF and C-RAF require additional post-
translational modifications for full activity [12, 13]. Moreover, this family of protein kinases 
interacts with numerous adapters, kinases, G-proteins, and chaperones to create signaling 
diversity [14].

Similarly, AKT is encoded by three separate genes, PKBα (AKT1) PKBβ (AKT2) and 
PKBγ (AKT3), whose activation also has different consequences. As such, Akt1 knockout 
mice display defects in overall growth, while Akt2 null mice are insulin intolerant and 
demonstrate a diabetes-like syndrome [15]. In sharp contrast, Akt3 knockout mice have a 
selective reduction in brain size, reflecting its robust expression in brain tissues [16].

2.2 Individual signaling molecules activate different effectors

GTP-bound RAS can directly activate at least three different proteins (RAF, 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K], and protein kinase C-zeta [PKCζ]), which transduce 
growth-promoting messages through distinct signaling pathways [17–19].

RAS-dependent RAF activation leads to the sequential phosphorylation of mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase (MEK) and p44/p42 extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) [20]. 
While neurofibromin loss and activation of MEK/ERK can lead to increased proliferation 
through ERK activation of transcriptional factors [21], it can also increase cell proliferation 
through a 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90-RSK)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-
dependent manner [22]. In addition, neurofibromin controls glial and neuronal 
differentiation in a RAF/MEK-dependent, but mTOR-independent, manner in brain neural 
stem cells (NSCs) by activating the Jagged1/Notch pathway [23]. Finally, oncogenic KRAS

increases NSC growth by negatively regulating the retinoblastoma protein in a RAF-
dependent, but MEK-independent, fashion [10].

As another RAS effector, PI3K signaling is required for a wide variety of critical cell 
processes [19, 24]. RAS activity increases PI3K activation, which allows 
phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) to convert into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-
triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 then recruits protein kinase B (AKT) to the plasma membrane, 
promoting PI3K-mediated phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1/PDK1) 
phosphorylation and activation of AKT. However, AKT-mediated mTOR activation can 
occur through a variety of mechanisms, including direct mTOR activation [25], 
phosphorylation of the proline-rich in AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) [26], or through 
inactivation of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) [27].

Lastly, RAS can transmit its growth promoting signaling through atypical Protein Kinase C 
molecules, like PKCζ, either involving PI3K [28] or independent of PI3K [29]. In neurons, 
reduced neurofibromin function leads to RAS-mediated PKCζ activation, resulting in G 
protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) suppression of G protein-coupled receptor 
function and reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production [17]. These 
distinct neurofibromin/RAS downstream pathways (RAF/MEK, PI3K/AKT, and PKCζ) 
create a diversity of signaling pathway activation following NF1 loss in specific cell types.

2.3 Individual molecules form protein complexes necessary for signaling transduction

Beyond RAS/RAS effector families and differential engagement of RAS downstream 
effectors, another mechanism for generating functional diversity is through the formation of 
multi-protein signaling complexes. Critical for neurofibromin/RAS growth control is the 
mTOR complex. mTOR operates in as at least two molecularly- and functionally-distinct 
protein complexes. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) consists of regulatory-associated protein 
of mTOR (Raptor) and PRAS40. Raptor is required for mTOR kinase activity by directly 
binding and activating mTORC1 effectors, such as the translational regulators p70 S6 kinase 
(S6K) and 4E (elF4E) binding protein (4EBP1) [30]. In contrast, mTOR complex 2 
(mTORC2) contains rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), protein observed 
with rictor (Protor), and mammalian stress-activated MAP kinase interacting protein-1 
(mSIN1), which are all required for the activation of mTORC2-specific effectors, AKT [31], 
protein kinase Cα,β, γ (PKCα, β, γ) [32], and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein 
kinase 1 (SGK1) [33]. While mTORC1 is critical for mediating ribosomal biogenesis and 
translational control, mTORC2 is essential for controlling cell survival, migration, and 
cytoskeletal dynamics [34].

3. Cellular Level

In addition to signaling diversity generated at the molecular level, there are cell type-specific 
constraints that operate to alter the way neurofibromin regulates RAS pathway activation 
and cell function. These include differences between cell types, as well as differences 
between the same cell type within a given tissue (Figure 2).

3.1 Cell type-specific control of RAS effector engagement

While neurofibromin suppresses RAS activity to control cell growth and survival in all cell 
types examined to date, how neurofibromin signals to its downstream effectors to mediate 
this effect depends entirely on the individual cell type. As such, central nervous system 
(CNS) neuronal growth and survival relies on RAS/PKCζ regulation of cAMP [17], rather 
than through MEK/ERK or PI3K [22]. In contrast, brain astroglial and NSCs use 
neurofibromin to control cell growth through the RAS/mTOR pathway [22, 35, 36]. 
However, Nf1-deficient astrocyte proliferation is dependent on mTOR/Rac1 activation [37], 
whereas NSCs use RAS/mTORC2/AKT/p27 signaling [36]. Additionally, neurofibromin 
control of mast cell function operates through RAS/PI3K/Rac1 [38], whereas Nf1-deficient 
osteoblast growth is dependent on RAS/ERK/RSK/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) 
signaling [39]. In microglia, neurofibromin controls cell proliferation and activation through 
the Rac1/mixed-lineage protein kinase 3 (MLK3)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 
(MKK4)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway [40]. In addition, the signature genetic 
alteration in low-grade gliomas involves the fusion of the BRAF gene to the amino terminal 
of the KIAA1549 protein product (f-BRAF). Similar to neurofibromin, ectopic f-BRAF 
expression increases RAS/MEK signaling in both astrocytes and NSCs, but only increases 
proliferation in NSCs and eventual tumor formation as a result of ERK-mediated mTOR 
activation [36, 41].

3.2 Regional constraints dictate RAS pathway function

Another contextual determinant that impacts RAS pathway signaling is the regional identity 
of the cell. In this respect, isolated astroglial cells have different levels of neurofibromin 
expression, with significantly higher Nf1 protein expression in the optic nerve, brainstem 
and cerebellar astrocytes relative to those from the neocortex [42]. For example, reduced 
neurofibromin expression in CNS neurons results in attenuated survival and neurite 
outgrowth, which depends on neurofibromin/RAS-controlled cAMP production [43], 
whereas, Nf1-deficient peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons have increased survival 
and longer neuritic processes, reflecting RAS-mediated AKT hyperactivation [44]. Finally, 
Nf1 loss in NSCs has differential effects depending on the region of the brain in which they 
reside. For example, Nf1-deficient NSCs from the third ventricular and brainstem exhibit 
increased proliferation and gliogenesis, whereas those from the lateral ventricle or neocortex 
of the same mouse do not [36].

4. Tissue Level

While it is clear that cell type and tissue location can differentially influence RAS signaling 
and functional outcome, additional factors operate at the tissue level to affect RAS pathway 
signaling (Figure 3). In the case of low-grade tumors arising in children and adults with NF1 
(neurofibromas, OPGs), evidence exists for an obligate role for cellular and acellular 
determinants in tumor formation and maintenance. While less is known about the role of 
acellular factors in NF1-associated tumors (extracellular matrix [ECM] components), 
expression of the ECM components, laminin-2α and integrin α6β1, potentiates high-grade 
glioma cell growth [45, 46].

In experimental mouse models of plexiform neurofibroma, both macrophages and bone 
marrow-derived mast cells control tumor formation and growth through the activation of 
RAS signaling. Using a combination of bone marrow transplantation and pharmacological 
inhibitor approaches, mast cells are required for murine plexiform neurofibroma formation 
and continued growth [47]. In these experiments, mast cells recruited by Nf1-deficient 
Schwann cell-produced stem cell factor (SCF or KIT-ligand) secrete cytokines that increase 
neurofibroma growth [48]. Moreover, SCF can also stimulate Nf1+/− mast cells to increase 
fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, thereby forming a permissive tumor 
microenvironment [49]. Interruption of this paracrine circuit with the c-KIT inhibitor, 
Imatinib, reduced plexiform neurofibroma growth [47].

In human low-grade gliomas, resident brain tissue macrophages (microglia) comprise 30–
50% of the cells [50], where they are critical for murine Nf1 OPG formation and progression 
[51]. As such, pharmacologic or genetic reduction of microglial function results in reduced 
tumor proliferation in vivo [40, 50, 52]. Since these tumor-associated microglia are the likely 
source of stromal chemokines and growth factors, one large-scale RNA-sequencing effort 
identified several potential candidates. The most promising molecule, the (C-C motif) ligand 
5 (CCL5) chemokine, increased Nf1-deficient optic nerve astrocyte proliferation in vitro. 
Importantly, inhibition of CCL5 using a neutralizing antibody resulted in reduced tumor 
growth in vivo [53], which operates in a RAS/AKT-dependent fashion [54].

NF1-associated CNS/PNS tumors arise in close proximity to central and peripheral nerves, 
raising the intriguing possibility that neuronal activity might influence tumorigenesis or 
tumor growth. Elegant studies in high-grade glioma (HGG) model systems have shown that 
neuronal activity increases HGG growth and proliferation in a PI3K/mTOR-dependent 
manner [55]. As such, increased cortical neuronal activity, controlled optogenetically in a 
mouse xenograft model, resulted in greater glioma growth and proliferation in vivo. Using a 
proteomic strategy, several secreted factors were identified from stimulated cortical brain 
slides, culminating in the discovery of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) as the responsible neuron-
derived mitogen [55].

5. Genomic/Genetic Level

Beyond the influences of the individual signaling molecules in different cell types and the 
impact of factors from the local tissue microenvironment, another mechanism by which 
diversity can be created is at the level of genetic and genomic changes. In the context of 
NF1, these include the specific germline NF1 gene mutation, cooperating genetic mutations, 
and genomic modifier loci (Figure 4).

5.1. The Nf1 germline mutation

Every individual with NF1 is born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene; however, 
>98% of individuals harbor a unique mutation. While there are few clear relationships 
between the specific germline NF1 gene mutation (genotype) and the clinical features of the 
disease (phenotype), converging evidence from epidemiologic, human NF1-patient iPSCs, 
and genetically-engineered mouse studies suggest that the specific germline NF1 gene 
mutation may be one predictive risk factor. As such, germline NF1 gene mutations have

been reported in families who exhibit other hallmarks of the disease, but do not develop 
cutaneous neurofibromas (c2979-2972 delAAT and Arg1809 missense mutations) [56–58]. 
These early-phase observations are bolstered by studies employing NF1-patient derived 
iPSCs and derivative neural progenitor cells. In these experiments, different NF1 germline 
mutations have differential effects on neurofibromin expression and function, with some 
mutations leading to minor reductions in neurofibromin levels and others with >70% 
decreases [59]. Using genetically-engineered mice designed to harbor the R681X mutation 
observed in a patient with an OPG or a missense mutation (G848R) found in individuals 
with spinal neurofibromatosis, differential effects of these mutations were found. Mice with 
the R681X mutation had in >70% reductions in neurofibromin levels, whereas those with the 
G848R mutation had <25% reductions [54]. Importantly, only those mice with the R681X 
mutation developed OPGs.

5.2. Cooperating genetic mutations

In addition to NF1 gene inactivation, additional molecular changes have been identified in 
human NF1-associated OPG that converge on the same signaling pathway regulated by 
neurofibromin [60, 61]. For example, a heterozygous PTEN deletion was identified in one 
NF1-OPG, raising the possibility that these coincident genetic changes cooperate with NF1 
loss to increase glioma growth and lead to clinically more aggressive neoplasms. Consistent 
with this idea, Nf1 genetically-engineered mice that also harbored a heterozygous PTEN 
mutation exhibited larger tumors with greater proliferation as a result of increased AKT 
activation [62].

5.3. Genomic modifier loci

Another way neurofibromin/RAS function can be modulated involves genomic modifier 
genes. While there is evidence for differences in racial and ethnic group risks for brain 
tumors [63], the most compelling data to support the existence of modifier loci derives from 
Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse models [64]. In these studies, NPcis mice, which carry 
mutations in the Nf1 and Trp53 genes on the same chromosome, develop HGG. However, 
NPcis mice on a C57BL/6 background developed brain tumors with high penetrance, 
whereas those on other genetic backgrounds do not. Further analyses of NPcis mice on 
different genetic backgrounds revealed the presence of modifier loci that influence spinal 
tumor development and brain astrocytoma formation [65], and high-grade peripheral nerve 
and brain tumor resistance in a sex-specific manner [66]. While it is not known how these 
modifiers operate to control tumorigenesis, one mechanism might involve differential Nf1 
gene expression [67].

6. Conclusions

Creating functional diversity from one protein and/or pathway through contextual signaling 
allows for a great deal of outcome specificity without having to increase the amount of 
genetic material, and thus is evolutionarily efficient. Using NF1 as a model, we have 
outlined how RAS signaling can be contextually modified at the molecular, cellular, tissue, 
and genomic/genetic levels (Figure 5). In this regard, each specific genetic mutation, 
signaling effector family member, cell type, and tissue work in a combination with one

another, as well as with genomic constraints, to encode a curated milieu that determines an 
explicit functional outcome and tumor pathology. As such, each RAS downstream effector 
can function in several states depending on the context in which it is activated.

The assumption that canonical signaling pathways function in a linear and static manner 
across all cell types and tissues may not fully represent the manner in which they truly 
operate. As detailed in this review, converging evidence from several types of experiments 
suggest that understanding the most accurate context in which mitogenic signaling drives 
cell growth yields a clearer picture of the mechanisms underlying NF1 heterogeneity at the 
cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. A deeper appreciation of contextual signaling may 
improve our understanding of the basic principles that govern development and is also likely 
to lead to the design of more effective therapies for diseases characterized by inappropriate 
RAS/RAS pathway activation, such as seen in NF1-related tumors. Defining and encoding 
these variables relative to disease pathogenesis will hopefully result in better risk assessment 
strategies and the individualized therapies.

Highlights

Cellular responses are dictated by context-dependent signaling pathway 
engagement

A limited number of molecules can activate multiple downstream 
effectors

Specific effector pathways are activated in a cell type and tissue-
specific manner

Extracellular cues and genomic/genetic factors modify signaling 
pathway output
