Background. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited
disease predisposing affected patients to variable numbers of benign
neuroﬁbromas. To date there are no effective chemotherapeutic
drugs available for this slow growing tumor. Molecularly targeted
agents that aim to slow neuroﬁbroma growth are being tested in
clinical trials. So preclinical models for testing potential therapies
are urgently needed to prioritize drugs for clinical trials of neuro-
ﬁbromas. Procedure. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
to monitor neuroﬁbroma development in the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre
mouse model of GEM grade I neuroﬁbroma. Based on studies
implicating mTOR and Raf signaling in NF1 mutant cells, we tested
the therapeutic effect of RAD001 and Sorafenib in this model. Mice
were scanned to establish growth rate followed by 8 weeks of drug
treatment, then re-imaged after the last dose of drug treatment.

Tumor volumes were determined by volumetric measurement.
Results. We found that rate of tumor growth varied among mice,
as it does in human patients. RAD001 inhibited its predicted target
pS6K, yet there was no signiﬁcant decrease in the tumor volume in
RAD001 treated mice compared to the vehicle control group. Sor-
afenib inhibited cyclinD1 expression and cell proliferation in
tumors,
identiﬁed signiﬁcant
decreases in tumor volume in some mice. Conclusion. The data
demonstrate that volumetric MRI analysis can be used to monitor
the therapeutic effect in the preclinical neuroﬁbroma drug screen-
ing, and suggest that Sorafenib might have clinical activity in some
neuroﬁbromas. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012;58:173–180.

INTRODUCTION

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas develop in 25–30% of children with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) [1]. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas are
benign peripheral nerve Schwann cell tumors that can cause dis-
ﬁgurement, nerve compression, and distortion or inﬁltration of
adjacent structures, and can compress vital structures causing
mortality [2]. The only current standard neuroﬁbroma therapy is
surgery, which is not always feasible as it necessitates removal of
tumors of neuroﬁbroma-integrated nerves. Even after surgery
many patients experience tumor recurrence [2]. To date there
are no effective chemotherapeutic drugs available for this slow
growing tumor, so molecularly targeted agents that aim to slow
plexiform neuroﬁbroma growth are being tested in clinical trials.
The activity of agents is being analyzed using sequential volu-
metric imaging of tumors using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), the most sensitive method available [3]. This method

allows to reproducibly (coefﬁcient of variation 5%) detect

smaller changes in plexiform neuroﬁbroma size compared to
standard solid tumor response criteria. In currently ongoing

clinical trials disease progression is deﬁned as a 20% increase,
and response as a 20% decrease in plexiform neuroﬁbroma

volume from baseline prior to initiation of investigational treat-
ments [3,4]. In a mouse model of neuroﬁbroma formation, neuro-
ﬁbroma growth was monitored by positron emission tomography
(PET) scanning [5]. Although PET may be more sensitive than
MRI for detecting smaller lesions, it cannot directly measure
tumor size and is more expensive than MRI. It would be useful
to prioritize drugs for clinical testing in a mouse model in pre-
clinical drug trials by monitoring tumor growth over time using
sequential volumetric imaging.

NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a GTPase activat-
ing protein (GAP) for Ras proteins [6]. Complete loss of NF1 in
neuroﬁbroma Schwann cells leads to increased levels of Ras-GTP
[7] known to activate Raf kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3
-kinase
(PI3K), and other signals, regulating cell proliferation, survival,

and cell death [8]. Research focused on the biology of NF1 and
pathogenesis of plexiform neuroﬁbroma and their malignant per-
ipheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) has identiﬁed potential
targets including Ras itself, Raf kinase, angiogenesis, growth
factor receptors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
[9,10]. For example, S6K1 is activated in MPSNT cells with
NF1 mutations, and this response is attenuated by rapamycin in
MPNST cell lines, MPNST xenografts, and in a genetic engin-
eered mouse model [11,12]. In a mouse sarcoma model in which
Nf1 and p53 mutations are in cis on mouse chromosome 11, mice
treated with rapamycin showed delayed tumor formation [11].
On this basis, a Phase II trial of rapamycin in plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas is ongoing.

Wu et al.

We developed the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre neuroﬁbroma mouse
model in which loss of both Nf1 alleles in developing Schwann
cell precursors at embryonic day 12.5 causes neuroﬁbroma for-
mation in adult mice [13]. The tumors show the loss of axon
Schwann cell interaction, mast cell accumulation, and ﬁbrosis,
which are characteristics of human plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Four
to 20 tumors arise in each mouse and at sacriﬁce each tumor
is >10 mm3. We reasoned that MRI with volumetric analysis
could be used to monitor neuroﬁbroma development
in the
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mouse model. Based on previous studies impli-
cating mTOR signaling and Raf signaling in NF1 mutant cells, we
tested the therapeutic effect of the rapamycin analog RAD001
[14], an mTOR inhibitor, and Sorafenib, a multi-targeted kinase
inhibitor that was originally developed as a raf kinase inhibitor
[15], in this model. We demonstrate that volumetric MRI can be
used to monitor neuroﬁbroma growth in mice. We also show that
RAD001 does not decrease neuroﬁbroma growth, while Sorafenib
has signiﬁcant therapeutic effect on some neuroﬁbromas in this
model.

METHODS

Mouse

We housed mice in temperature- and humidity-controlled
facilities on a 12-hr dark–light cycle with free access to food
and water as described previously [13]. The animal care and
use committee of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
approved all animal use. The mice were in a mixed C57/129/
FVBN strain background and were interbred to obtain the
expected genotype. Mouse genotyping has been described [13].

Chemicals

RAD001 and vehicle carrier were obtained from Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corporation (East Hanover, NJ). RAD001 was
in a microemulsion solvent that was diluted to three parts 2%
carboxyl methylcellulose and two parts 6% captisol for in vivo
usage [16].

Sorafenib was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn,
MA). Sorafenib was dissolved in 50% cremophor EL (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO)–50% ethanol (Pharmaco Products, Brookﬁeld,
CT). The mixture was sonicated for 1–2 min on ice to dissolve
Sorafenib. Once in solution, the aqueous component (75% water)
was gradually added and diluted to generate the ﬁnal dosing
solution. Each dose was weighed and stored in dry form away
from light and was dissolved to liquid form immediately prior to
oral gavage.

Preclinical Paradigms

RAD001. We used RAD001 instead of its analog rapamycin
because of improved oral availability [17]. The RAD001 dose was
chosen based on studies in which daily oral administration of
RAD001 at 10 mg/kg produced transient
tumor stasis in an
MPNST xenograft model [12] and after a preliminary tolerated
dose study in the neuroﬁbroma mouse model (not shown). Seven-

month-old Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mice (n ¼ 15) were imaged by MRI
diluted in three vehicle carrier. Vehicle-treated mice (n ¼ 5) were

followed by daily oral gavage for 8 weeks of RAD001 (10 mg/kg)

gavaged daily with the same solution lacking RAD001. These

Pediatr Blood Cancer DOI 10.1002/pbc

animals were re-imaged by MRI at 9 months of age after the
completion of the last dose.

For the Sorafenib trial, 9-month-old Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mice
(n ¼ 10) were imaged by MRI then treated with Sorafenib

(45 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage. This Sorafenib dose was chosen
based on preclinical studies in which daily oral administration of
Sorafenib at 30–60 mg/kg produced complete tumor stasis during
treatment in ﬁve of six tumor models tested [15,18] and a pre-
liminary maximum tolerated dose test in this neuroﬁbroma mouse

model (not shown). A control group (n ¼ 4) received 200 ml of

vehicle daily.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Mice were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane in air and main-
tained during imaging on 1% isoﬂurane in air. Mice were posi-
tioned in a linear volume transmit/receive coil using a bite bar to
secure their heads. Respiration rate and temperature were moni-
tored with a Model 1025 monitoring and gating system from
Small Animal Instruments, Stony Brook, NY. The respiration rate
was around 100 breaths/min and the temperature was set to 328C.
All data were acquired with a 7T Bruker Biospec (Ettlingen,
Germany) equipped with 400 G/cm gradients. Localizer images
were acquired in three planes to position the 3D volume. Fat-
suppressed 3D rapid acquisition with refocused echo (RARE) data
were acquired with an effective echo time of 35.39 msec, repeti-

tion time of 1,000 msec, 1 average, a ﬁeld-of-view of 51.2 mm 
25.6 mm  26.5 mm and a matrix size of 256  128  128.

Respiratory gating was used to minimize motion artifacts. The
total scan time for each mouse at each time point was approxi-
mately 30 min.

Tumor Volumetric Measurement

To determine the reproducibility of

the volumetric MRI
analysis in tumor bearing mice, one observer (ED) applied the
method to the tumors of ten randomly selected mice on three
different days. We obtained mouse MRIs at age of 4, 6, 8 10,
and 12 months for a natural history study; at age of 6, 7, and
9 months for the RAD001 treatment groups; and at age 5, 7, 9,
and 11 months for the Sorafenib treatment groups. On the above-
described 3D RARE sequence,
the plexiform neuroﬁbromas
appear bright in contrast to most other tissues. Medx software
(Medical Numerics, Inc., Germantown, MD) was used for volu-
metric analysis. One observer (ED) manually outlined lesions on
each MRI slice containing tumor. Tumor on the left- and right-
hand side of each mouse was measured separately at the cervical
and thoracic levels, where the bulk of tumor was identiﬁed.
Smaller cauda equine tumors were not included in the analysis,
as the resolution in this region limited accuracy. Measurement
error increases for tumors with volumes <10 mm3, therefore, we
report only tumors with volumes >10 mm3. The tumor criteria
were based on image resolution and MRI section slice thickness
similar to those described previously [3]. The program calculated
tumor volume from the area of graphic outline and MRI slice
thickness. All volumes are reported as combined tumor volume in
an individual mouse.

Western Blotting

Tumor proteins were extracted using extraction buffer (20 mm
NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10%

glycerol, 10 mm sodium ﬂuoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate,

were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis on 4–20% tris-glycine gel
(Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene di-
ﬂouride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat

milk þ 0.1% TBST to minimize nonspeciﬁc binding. Antibodies

recognizing pERK, ERK, CyclinD1, pS6K(ser240/244), total S6,
p4E-BP1, total 4E-BP1, and b-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) were detected by incubation of the membrane with speciﬁc
antibodies. Antibody binding to the membrane was visualized
using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham,
Arlington Heights, IL). The bands obtained were quantiﬁed by
Kodak 1D Imagine Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Company,
Wheeling, IL). Anti-b-actin was used as a loading control. At
least three different tumor lysates were analyzed for each antigen.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry on tumor sections was performed as
described previously [20]. Brieﬂy, following deparafﬁnization
and rehydration, we permeabilized sections with 0.2% TX 100
and blocked with 10% normal serum for 1 hr at room tempera-
ture. Primary antibodies were: Ki67, Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling),

secondary incubations were with host-appropriate secondary anti-
bodies. We acquired microscopic images with Openlab software
suites on a Zeiss Axiovert 200.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis

Samples were prepared and quantiﬁed using a validated
HPLC/MS/MS method adapted from an assay developed by Jain
et al. [21]. The lower limit of quantiﬁcation was 5 ng/ml. Plasma
samples were drawn at times 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hr post-Sorafenib
dose on day 6. Only one time point was sampled in each mouse
and each time point was sampled in three mice.

Statistical Analysis

Data shown in the text is presented in tumor volume in mm3.
In the plots, data is presented centered at the last pretreatment
value within each mouse. To derive P values, we conducted a
random effects model analysis on the log transformed tumor
volume data [22] using SAS mixed procedure. The log transform-
ation stabilized the variability of data across time. Tumors grew
linearly on a logarithmic scale over the study period in the control
group within each mouse and the individual linear growth trajec-
tories were estimated by random coefﬁcients linear regression. We
allowed the slope of the linear growth in the treatment groups to
be adjusted in the post treatment period. A signiﬁcantly negative
yet small adjustment in the slope indicates reduced growth rate,
while a signiﬁcantly negative and large adjustment

accounted for different measurement time points across treatment
groups and variability in the growth trajectory across mice.
Results are summarized by the plots of mean tumor growth
trajectories. To compare statistical signiﬁcance to data obtained
in clinical trials, we also used Pearson’s x2 test of medians.

RESULTS

Natural History of Neurofibroma in the
Nf1flox/flox;DhhCre Mouse Model

We used MRI to study tumors in the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mouse
model. The MRI image characteristics of the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre
neuroﬁbromas strongly resembled those of human neuroﬁbromas
as shown in Figure 1. As shown in the lower panels, the tumors
could be distinguished from other tissues and could be outlined
for use in volumetric measurement.

The median volume of tumors used to determine the reprodu-
cibility of the volumetric MRI analysis was 65.6 mm3 (range,
12.5–231.8 mm3), and the coefﬁcient of variation (CV ¼

standard deviation/mean) for repeated analysis of the same tumor
by different observers was 5.7% (range 0.7–10.8%). The CV was
less than 10% for all but the two smallest tumors (12.5 mm3 and
27.7 mm3) analyzed.
[4]. Mice (n ¼ 5) were repeatedly imaged at 2-month intervals

Tumor growth was determined by volumetric measurement

from 4 to 12 months of age months using a Bruker 7.0T MRI
(Fig. 2A). All ﬁve mice had developed tumors by 4 months of age,
and tumors continued to increase in size. Due to imaging artifact,
one animal was excluded from volumetric analysis. Figure 2B
shows coronal and axial
images of one mouse at 6, 8, and
12 months of age, demonstrating the visible increase in tumor
size. A group of 20 mice including those used in the natural

history study (n ¼ 5), RAD001 study ( ¼ 4), Sorafenib study
(n ¼ 4), and other studies (n ¼ 7) were pooled and evaluated

for growth over time as controls (Fig. 2C). Similar to what has
been observed for human neuroﬁbromas [4], the growth rate of
GEM grade I neuroﬁbromas varied between mice, but appeared
constant within individual mice.

About 10% of Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mice developed large tumor
nodules underneath the dermis (Supplemental Fig. 1). On histo-
pathology,
these tumor nodules showed characteristic GEM-
neuroﬁbroma grade 1 (not shown). These tumors sometimes
eroded the overlying skin due to inﬂammatory reaction and were
not included in our analyses.

RAD001 Has No Effect on Inhibiting Neurofibroma
Growth in Nf1flox/flox;DhhCre Mice

To investigate the utility of the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre neuroﬁ-
broma mouse model as a preclinical model we ﬁrst chose to
determine the effect of RAD001 as a single agent. Mice

(n ¼ 15) born in a cohort within one month of each other were

pooled and scanned in a group (beginning at 5–6 months of age).
One month later they were scanned again and then randomized to

control (n ¼ 5) and treatment (n ¼ 10) trial arms. Treatment

consisted of 8 weeks of daily oral gavage at a dose of 10 mg/
kg. Mouse weights were obtained twice weekly. Mice were re-
imaged after the last dose of drug (Fig. 3A). All mice survived the
8 weeks of treatment without lethargy, dehydration or signiﬁcant

4E-BP1, was decreased in RAD001 treated tumors as compared to
controls, indicating its activation (Fig. 3B) [23]. Consistent with
this result in one of two tumors, a band shift to lower mobility
was observed on RAD001 exposure. Thus, RAD001 treatment of
neuroﬁbromas completely inhibits the activation of p70 S6 kinase
but seems to slightly decrease phosphorylation (activate) 4E-BP1
in response to RAD001.

Tumor volumes were determined by volumetric measurement
at each time point. As noted above, tumor growth rates varied
among mice. There was no signiﬁcant decrease in tumor volume

growth rate in RAD001 treated mice (n ¼ 10) compared to the
vehicle control group (n ¼ 5, and pooled controls P ¼ 0.36;

Supplemental Fig. 2) using random effects model analysis or
Pearson’s x2 test of medians (Fig. 3C,D; Supplemental Tables 1
and 2). We also did not detect a difference in cell apoptosis in
RAD001 treated mice compared to control treatment in neuro-
ﬁbroma parafﬁn sections by TUNEL assay. We did not detect any
change in cyclin D1 or active caspase 3 by Western blot compared
to control tumors (not shown).

Sorafenib Significantly Decreases the Neurofibroma
Growth Rate in Nf1flox/flox;DhhCre Mice

To test the therapeutic effect of Sorafenib, a multi-targeted
kinase inhibitor that was originally developed as a raf kinase

inhibitor, on neuroﬁbroma growth, we treated mice (n ¼ 9) with
Sorafenib daily or vehicle control (n ¼ 4) by daily oral gavage.

To ensure that growth rate was accurately represented, an
additional scan was included prior to onset of treatment. Thus
mice were scanned at 5, 7, and 9 months to establish tumor
growth rate. This additional scan demonstrated a constant growth
rate, indicating that the intermediate scan is not necessary. The 9-
month scan was followed by 8 weeks of drug treatment by daily
oral gavage. Mice were re-imaged after the last dose of Sorafenib

Pediatr Blood Cancer DOI 10.1002/pbc

at 11 months of age. Tumor volumes were determined by volu-
metric measurement. All mice survived the 8 weeks of treatment
without weight loss or other obvious side effects.

We monitored plasma drug concentration at various times after
oral Sorafenib administration. Sorafenib was readily absorbed and
measurable. The median Sorafenib concentration was 23.7 mg/ml
(range, 16.6–945 mg/ml) (Fig. 4D). Peak exposure was at 1 hr and
drug was maintained through 8 hr
(Fig. 4D) as previously
described [24].

We observed signiﬁcant decreases in tumor volume (negative
slope) in ﬁve of nine Sorafenib treated mice (Fig. 4C). One mouse
receiving Sorafenib stabilized, while three others continued to
grow with unchanged growth rate. All vehicle control mice had
tumors that continued to grow throughout the experiment exclud-
ing a carrier effect. The difference between Sorafenib and vehicle

controls was signiﬁcant
Pharmacodynamic measurement of Sorafenib efﬁcacy was moni-
tored indirectly by levels of cyclin D1. Western blots showed that
Sorafenib inhibited cyclinD1 expression in two of the three eval-
uated tumor lysates taken 1 hr after the ﬁnal dose of Sorafenib
(Fig. 4B). We also found that pERK expression levels were elev-
ated in these two tumors. Intriguingly, cyclin D1 decreased and
P-ERK increased only in the two tumors from mice which
responded to Sorafenib treatment with decreased tumor volume
(Fig. 4B).

To assess the mechanism underlying Sorafenib treatment, we
determined if Sorafenib treatment resulted in increased apoptosis
and/or decreased proliferation within the neuroﬁbroma specimens
by staining active caspase 3 (apoptosis) and ki67 (proliferation).
We observed a decrease in the number of ki67-positive cells in
Sorafenib treated neuroﬁbromas that were taken out from the
mice 1 hr after the ﬁnal dose of Sorafenib (P < 0.05, Fig. 5).
We did not detect differences in active caspase 3 between Sor-
afenib and vehicle treated mouse neuroﬁbromas by Western blot

form in 100% of mice and recapitulate the histology and imaging
characteristics of human neuroﬁbromas [13]. In patients, neuro-
ﬁbromas develop along nerve roots and adjacent peripheral
nerves, paraspinally, and in deep or superﬁcial locations. Our
use of 7 Tesla small-animal MRI enabled our conclusion that
the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mouse model mimics mainly the paraspinal

phenotype, with tumors predominantly related to the cervical and
thoracic spine.

We assessed tumor growth rate in the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre
mouse model using volumetric MRI analysis. The same volumet-
ric measurement technique is in use in ongoing clinical trials and
has been proven to sensitively detect small changes in tumor size
over time [3,4]. The reproducibility of this method is similar for
tumors in mice and humans, and thus the response criteria used in
human trials can be applied to the preclinical evaluation in mice.
In humans, growth rate varies between patients but appears to be
consistent within an individual. Similarly, in the mouse model we
identiﬁed fast and slow growing tumors, and steady growth for
individual tumors. However, in patients with NF1 enrolling in
clinical trials most rapid plexiform neuroﬁbroma growth was in
young children; older patients typically had little or no growth [4].
In contrast, in the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mouse model, tumors are
visible by 4 months on MRI and continue to grow until mice
require sacriﬁce due to spinal cord compression at around 1 year.

(cell autonomous and/or noncell autonomous) in many tumors
will be an interesting avenue for follow-up studies.

Sorafenib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor being tested in a
Phase I trial in pediatric patients with NF1 and plexiform neuro-
ﬁbroma. Mice exposed to Sorafenib with tumor growth inhibition
also showed decreased expression of the cell cycle regulator
cyclin D1, consistent with an effect on tumor growth. Sorafenib
inhibited tumor cell proliferation, as attested by immunostaining.
The target(s) of Sorafenib in this model are not clear. Raf is
predicted to be activated downstream of Ras activation caused
by NF1 loss. Tumor lysates showed increased pERK expression,
likely due to a negative feedback loop caused by Raf kinase
inhibition [26–29]. Sorafenib also inhibits activity of receptors
implicated in neuroﬁbroma cells
including c-kit, VGFR2,
VGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß, and Flt-3,
one or more of which might account for some effects of Sorafenib
on individual tumors [15]. The reason that ﬁve of nine mice
responded to Sorafenib exposure by tumor shrinkage while four
of nine did not is unknown and needs to be studied in the future.
Because the mouse strain is a mixed genetic background, there
may be co-modiﬁer genes that differ among the animals that alter
drug metabolism or target sensitivity, possibilities supported by
the variability seen in our individual pharmacodynamic and phar-
macokinetic data (Fig. 4B and D, respectively). Drug penetration
into different tumor sites may also vary among mice because of
the blood–tumor barrier, or
interstitial pressure on selected
tumors. Tissue drug levels and pharmacodynamic studies of tumor
tissue will be of interest in future preclinical neuroﬁbroma trial
design.

Our data demonstrate that Sorafenib can reduce the growth of
certain neuroﬁbromas and suggest
that Sorafenib might have
clinical therapeutic effects on neuroﬁbromas. More importantly,
our data show that
to
monitor tumor response to targeted therapeutics, indicating the
potential usage of this model for preclinical drug screening.

the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mice are useful

ation. A: Immunostaining with Ki-67 (MIB-1) shows signiﬁcantly

We scanned untreated and carrier treated mice at numerous
intervals. Based on tumor natural history, we suggest that future
preclinical trials using this model will best be accomplished by
imaging mice at 5 and 7 months, then using a 2 months treatment
followed by a ﬁnal scan. This paradigm takes into account both
the continuous growth of tumors in the model and the time of
signiﬁcant death of Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;DhhCre mice, occurring mainly
after 9 months of age. Because in individual mice tumor size
and growth rate differ, another possible paradigm would be to
measure tumor growth rate and only treat mice with large tumors,
or tumors of roughly the same size. The fact that we have no
evidence that large and small tumors respond differently to drugs
argues against this approach, and such a restriction would not
reﬂect the heterogeneity of patients seen in clinical settings.

The predictable neuroﬁbroma growth rate in the Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;
DhhCre mouse model enabled preclinical drug screening. We
did not detect discernable effects on tumor growth, tumor cell
proliferation, or cell apoptosis on RAD001 treated mice. Sim-
ilarly, sirolimus (rapamycin) was not effective in shrinking non-
progressive plexiform neuroﬁbromas in a Phase 2 trial in children
and adults with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neuroﬁbromas.
Whether sirolimus prolongs time to progression in subjects with
progressive plexiform neuroﬁbromas remains to be determined,
and we await trial results with interest [25]. Mouse tumor cells
had adequate exposure to RAD001, as neuroﬁbroma pS6 kinase
was blocked by exposure to RAD001. It is known that in some
systems mTOR blockade can cause feedback activation of Akt
activity [26], and it remains possible that this or alternative com-
pensatory mechanisms might account for the failure of RAD001
