International network of cancer genome
projects

The International Cancer Genome Consortium*

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was launched to coordinate large-scale cancer genome studies in
tumours from 50 different cancer types and/or subtypes that are of clinical and societal importance across the globe.
Systematic studies of more than 25,000 cancer genomes at the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels will reveal
the repertoire of oncogenic mutations, uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define clinically relevant subtypes for
prognosis and therapeutic management, and enable the development of new cancer therapies.

T he genomes of all cancers accumulate somatic mutations1.

These include nucleotide substitutions, small insertions and
deletions, chromosomal rearrangements and copy number
changes that can affect protein-coding or regulatory com-
ponents of genes. In addition, cancer genomes usually acquire so-
matic epigenetic ‘marks’ compared to non-neoplastic tissues from
the same organ, notably changes in the methylation status of cyto-
sines at CpG dinucleotides.

A subset of the somatic mutations in cancer cells confers oncogenic
properties such as growth advantage, tissue invasion and metastasis,
angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis2. These are termed ‘driver’
mutations. The identification of driver mutations will provide insights
into cancer biology and highlight new drug targets and diagnostic
tests. Knowledge of cancer mutations has already led to the develop-
ment of specific therapies, such as trastuzumab for HER2 (also known
as NEU or ERBB2)-positive breast cancers3 and imatinib, which
targets BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase for the treatment of chronic myeloid
leukaemia4,5. The remaining somatic mutations in cancer genomes
that do not contribute to cancer development are called ‘passengers’.
These mutations provide insights into the DNA damage and repair
processes that have been operative during cancer development,
including exogenous environmental exposures6,7. In most cancer
genomes, it is anticipated that passenger mutations, as well as germline
variants not yet catalogued in polymorphism databases, will substan-
tially outnumber drivers.

therapeutic targets for several

Large-scale analyses of genes in tumours have shown that the
mutation load in cancer is abundant and heterogeneous8–13.
Preliminary surveys of cancer genomes have already demonstrated
their relevance in identifying new cancer genes that constitute poten-
tial
including
PIK3CA14, BRAF15, NF1 (ref. 10), KDR10, PIK3R1 (ref. 9), and histone
methyltransferases and demethylases16,17. These projects have also
yielded correlations between cancer mutations and prognosis, such
as IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in several types of gliomas13,18.
Advances in massively parallel sequencing technology have enabled
sequencing of entire cancer genomes19–22.

types of cancer,

Following the launch of comprehensive cancer genome projects in
the United Kingdom (Cancer Genome Project)23 and the United
States (The Cancer Genome Atlas)24, cancer genome scientists and
funding agencies met in Toronto (Canada) in October 2007 to dis-
cuss the opportunity to launch an international consortium. Key
reasons for its formation were: (1) the scope is huge; (2) independent
cancer genome initiatives could lead to duplication of effort or

incomplete studies; (3) lack of standardization across studies could
diminish the opportunities to merge and compare data sets; (4) the
spectrum of many cancers is known to vary across the world; and (5)
an international consortium will accelerate the dissemination of data
sets and analytical methods into the user community.

Working groups were created to develop strategies and policies
that would form the basis for participation in the ICGC. The goals of
the consortium (Box 1) were released in April 2008 (http://www.icgc.
org/files/ICGC_April_29_2008.pdf). Since then, working groups and
initial member projects have further refined the policies and plans for
international collaboration.

Bioethical framework
ICGC members agreed to a core set of bioethical elements for consent
as a precondition of membership (Box 2). The Ethics and Policy

Box 1j Goals of the ICGC
The goals of the ICGC are:
$ To coordinate the generation of comprehensive catalogues of genomic
abnormalities (somatic mutations) in tumours in 50 different cancer types
and/or subtypes that are of clinical and societal importance across the globe.
$ To ensure high quality by defining the catalogue for each tumour type or
subtype to include the full range of somatic mutations, such as single-
nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, copy number changes,
translocations and other chromosomal rearrangements, and to have the
following features. (1) Comprehensiveness, such that most cancer genes
with somatic abnormalities occurring at a frequency of greater than 3% are
discovered. (2) High resolution, ideally at a single nucleotide level. (3) High
quality, using common standards for pathology and technology. (4) Data
from matched non-tumour tissue, to distinguish somatic from inherited
sequence variants and aberrations. (5) Generate complementary
catalogues of transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets from the same
tumours.
$ Make the data available to the entire research community as rapidly as
possible, and with minimal restrictions, to accelerate research into the
causes and control of cancer.
$ Coordinate research efforts so that the interests and priorities of
individual participants, self-organizing consortia, funding agencies and
nations are addressed, including use of the burden of disease and the
minimization of unnecessary redundancy in tumour analysis efforts.
$ Support the dissemination of knowledge and standards related to new
technologies, software, and methods to facilitate data integration and
sharing with cancer researchers around the globe.

Box 2j Core bioethical elements
For prospective research, ICGC members should convey to potential
participants, that:
$ The ICGC is a coordinated effort among related scientific research
projects being carried on around the world.
$ Participation in the ICGC and its component projects is voluntary.
$ Samples and data collected will be used for cancer research, which may
include whole-genome sequencing.
$ The patient’s care will not be affected by their decision about
participation.
$ The samples collected will be in limited quantities; access to them will be
tightly controlled and will depend on the policy and practices of the ICGC-
member project. At least a small percentage of the samples may be shared
with laboratories in other countries for the purposes of performing quality
control studies.
$ Data derived from the samples collected and data generated by the
ICGC members will be made accessible to ICGC members and other
international researchers through either an open or a controlled access
database under terms and conditions that will maximize participant
confidentiality.
$ The researchers accessing data and samples will be required to affirm
that they will not attempt to re-identify participants.
$ There is a remote risk of being identified from data available on the
databases.
$ Once data are placed in open databases, those data cannot be
withdrawn later.
$ In controlled access databases the links to (local) data that can identify
an individual will be destroyed after withdrawal. Data previously distributed
will continue to be used.
$ ICGC members agree not to make claims to possible intellectual
property on primary data.
$ No profit from eventual commercial products will be returned to
subjects donating samples.
For retrospective research, the above guidelines remain the same, with the
exception that where the individual is no longer a patient, there will not be a
concern that their care could be affected by participation.
For research involving samples and data from deceased individuals:
$ Where required by law or ethics, consent should always be obtained
from the families of a deceased individual if their samples and data are to be
used; if re-consent is not required, however, ethics review is sufficient.
$ Ethics committee review should be sought for all research proposing the
use of existing sample and data collections.
$ Existing collections are a limited and valuable resource; access to them
will be tightly controlled.
For research using anonymized samples, ethics review may be required in
some jurisdictions.

Committee has created patient consent templates for both prospec-
tive collection and retrospective use of samples and data for ICGC
projects. Differences in project-specific requirements and national
legal frameworks may require some local amendments, while still
reflecting the core principles of ICGC.

The ICGC recognizes a delicate balance between protecting parti-
cipants’ personal data and sharing these data to accelerate cancer
research. Data access policies have been drawn up that are respectful
of the rights of the donors, while allowing ICGC data derived from
samples to be shared ethically among a wide research community.
Two levels of access have been implemented. For data that cannot
be used to identify individuals, ‘open access’ data sets are publicly
available. These include data such as gender, age range, histology,
normalized gene expression values, epigenetic data sets, somatic
mutations, summaries of germline data, and study protocols.
‘Controlled access’ data sets contain germline genomic data and
detailed clinical information that are associated to a unique individual
whose personal identifiers have been removed. To access controlled
data sets researchers must seek authorizations by contacting the Data
Access Compliance Office (DACO) (http://www.icgc.org/daco). An
independent International Data Access Committee (IDAC) oversees
the work of the DACO and provides assistance with resolving issues
that arise.

Pathology and clinical annotation
Large-scale genomic studies of human tumours rely on the availability
of freshly frozen tumour tissue. To address the paucity of samples that
meet ICGC standards, many projects have initiated prospective collec-
tions of high-quality source material. Accordingly, the ICGC recom-
mended procedures to promote consistency of sample processing
throughout the consortium and ensure a series of quality features such
as high tissue integrity and tumour cell content. Each project will need
to include diverse data types, such as environmental exposures, clinical
history of participants, tumour histopathology, and clinical outcomes.
Tumours show considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity
that has resulted in a variety of tumour classifications. Within the
ICGC, special measures are taken to promote the consistency of dia-
gnosis. These include the coordination of diagnostic criteria among
groups investigating tumours that are related, and policies that all
samples will be reviewed by at least two independent reference pathol-
ogists. Furthermore, images of the stained tumour sections (or blood
smear or cytospins for haematological neoplasias) from which dia-
gnoses were made, will be stored and made available to the community.
Although different tumour types may require specific procedures
for tumour acquisition or compilation of clinical and environmental
data, the ICGC has set guidelines about the use of common definitions
and data standards. This will allow ICGC data users to identify corre-
lations between tumour-specific molecular changes with clinical and
histopathological data including prognosis, prediction of therapy res-
ponse and tumour classification schemes for diagnosis.

Study design and statistical issues
To identify cancer-related genes, one needs to detect genes that are
mutated at a higher frequency than the background mutation rate.
Given that several driver genes have been found to be mutated at low
frequencies, the ICGC will identify somatic mutations observed in at
least 3% of tumours of a given subtype. The ICGC determined that
500 samples would be needed per tumour type (although for rare
tumour types, a smaller sample size may be justified). In practice, the
degree of heterogeneity of a given tumour type is difficult to know in
advance, such that some particularly heterogeneous tumour types
may require larger sample collections.

Cancer genome analyses
High-quality catalogues of somatic mutations from whole cancer
genomes will ultimately be the ICGC standard. Shotgun sequencing
using second generation technologies can detect all classes of somatic
mutation implicated in cancer. Moreover, if the level of coverage is
sufficient, comprehensive high-quality catalogues of somatic muta-
tions from individual cancer genomes can be acquired with .90%
sensitivity and .95% specificity. To achieve this, it will be necessary
to sequence the genome of both the cancer and a normal tissue from
the same individual to distinguish germline variants. Although a few
genomes of this standard have already been generated, the cost and
the continuing technology development will mean that interim ana-
lyses of particularly informative sectors of the genome will be carried
out, for example of all coding exons and microRNAs.

For each individual cancer genome, the catalogue of somatic
mutations will be supplemented by genome-wide information on
the state of methylation of CpG dinucleotides. The optimal strategies
and technologies to achieve this are not yet clear. Moreover, the
genomes of individual cancers will be accompanied, where possible,
by analyses of the transcriptome. Although conventional array-based
approaches predominate at present, it is preferable that RNA sequen-
cing becomes the standard as sequencing has a greater dynamic
range25 and provides further information including new transcripts
and sequence variants26.

ICGC data sets
The distributed nature of the consortium coupled with the large size
of the data sets makes it cumbersome to store all data in a single

PERSPECTIVES

centralized repository. For this reason, the ICGC has adopted a
‘franchise’ database model for integrating the information and mak-
ing it available to the public. Under this model, each member project
releases tumour information by copying it into its local franchise
database after it has been quality checked. Each franchise database
shares a common schema to describe the specimens, the associated
clinical information, and their genome characterization data. ICGC
primary data files, are sent to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and/or the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EBI) for archiving, while interpreted data sets, such as somatic
mutation calls, are stored in franchise databases. The ICGC franchise
databases and web portal use BioMart27, a data federation technology
originally developed for use in Ensembl28, and since adopted for use
by several model organism and genome databases. The management
of the ICGC data flow is the responsibility of the ICGC Data
Coordination Center (DCC) located at the Ontario Institute for
Cancer Research.

The DCC also operates the ICGC data portal that allows researchers
to access both open and controlled access portions of the ICGC data.
The portal provides a variety of user interfaces that range from simple
gene-oriented queries (‘show me all the non-silent coding mutations
identified in PIK3R1 for all cancers’) to queries that integrate genomic,
clinical and functional information (‘show me all members of the Toll-
receptor pathway having deletions in stage III breast cancer’). These
queries will be distributed across the franchise databases in a manner
that is invisible to the user. The portal will also provide links to the
primary files at the NCBI and EBI, interfaces for generating tabular
reports, data dumps in common bioinformatics formats, and other
visualizations including genome browser tracks, pathway diagrams
and survival curves. The portal is available via a link at http://www.icgc.
org.

At the time of this publication, the following cancer and reference
data sets will be available through the ICGC web portal: (1) initial data
releases from ICGC members for breast cancer (UK), liver cancer
(Japan), and pancreatic cancer (Australia and Canada); (2) a whole
genome data set of a metastatic melanoma cell line (COLO829)6; (3)
open data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for glioblas-
toma multiforme (GBM) and serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary
(see later); (4) whole exome somatic mutation data from 68 indivi-
duals with breast, colorectal, pancreatic cancer and GBM11–13; (5) links
to the human reference genome (http://www.genomereference.org/)
and gene annotations from the GENCODE project (http://www.
sanger.ac.uk/gencode/) that includes the CCDS gene set29; (6) links
to the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP)30 and the
HapMap31 databases, providing access to common patterns of vari-
ation in reference population samples; (7) links to Reactome32, a
curated database of biological pathways in human; and (8) a set of
reference gene models, mirrored from ENSEMBL28.

The current version of the web portal provides an entry point to
the open access data tier by interactive query as well as bulk download
of data files. We expect that in mid-2010 both open access and con-
trolled data will be available.

The ICGC recently established a bioinformatics analysis working
group to compare pipelines, analytic methods, consistency within
and among algorithms, and establish guidelines or best practices
for the consortium. Over time, significant resources will be deployed
to develop strategies to analyse the large complex data sets generated
by ICGC member projects, and provide value-added views of cancer
genomic data by integrating them with other biological and epide-
miological data sets.

Data release and intellectual property policies
The data release policies of the ICGC are intended to maximize public
benefit while, at the same time, protecting the interests and rights of
sample donors and their relatives. Members of the ICGC are com-
mitted to the principles of rapid data release (with appropriate con-
trolled access mechanisms),
in concordance with the Toronto

statement33. ICGC members encourage the scientific community to
use any data that targets specific genes and mutations, without any
restrictions. To allow ICGC members the opportunity to be the first
to publish global analyses from data sets they generate, the consor-
tium has also agreed that member projects may specify conditions
that include a time limit during which other data users are asked to
refrain from publishing global analyses (defined by several ICGC
member projects as 100 tumours and matched controls), a provision
referred to as a ‘publication moratorium’. To allow time for a data set
to be analysed and submitted for publication, ICGC members will
have at most one year after released data sets reach the specified
threshold before third parties are permitted to submit manuscripts
describing global analyses. Further details on data release guidelines
for data producers, users and reviewers are available http://www.icgc.
org. Users of ICGC data are expected to respect these terms and to cite
this manuscript and the source of pre-publication data, including the
version of the data set. In cases of uncertainty, scientists using ICGC
data are encouraged to contact the member projects to discuss pub-
lication plans.

ICGC members believe that maximum public benefit will be
achieved if the data remain publicly accessible without patent restric-
tions, hence no claims to possible intellectual property derived from
primary data (including somatic mutations) will be made. Users of
ICGC data (including ICGC members) may elect to perform further
research and to exercise their intellectual property rights on these
downstream discoveries. If this occurs, users are expected to imple-
ment licensing policies that do not obstruct further research.

Initial ICGC projects
At present, ten countries and two European consortia have initiated
cancer genome projects under the umbrella of the ICGC. The initial
projects, listed in Supplementary Table 1, will analyse tumour types
found around the globe and throughout the human body affecting a
diversity of organs, including blood, brain, breast, kidney, liver, pan-
creas, stomach, oral cavity and ovary. Over time, the ICGC will
investigate 50 or more types and subtypes of cancer in adults and
children. In the case of tumours with several subtypes, analyses
should be focused on subtypes that may be defined on pathological,
molecular, aetiological or geographical differences. It is expected that
some cancer types will be studied in parallel in different parts of the
world, as the mutation profiles may differ among populations. The
consortium has enabled the coordination of initial projects analysing
similar cancers in different countries, and in some cases, the redirec-
tion of resources to launch new projects.

The Cancer Genome Atlas
TCGA is a comprehensive program in cancer genomics that is jointly
supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute and the
National Human Genome Research Institute of the US National
Institutes of Health. TCGA began in 2006 as a pilot focused on three
projects, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), serous cystadenocarci-
noma of the ovary, and lung squamous carcinoma, and has recently
expanded to produce comprehensive genomic data sets for at least
ten other cancers in the next two years. Given TCGA’s contributions
in launching the ICGC and cooperation to ensure that its policies
(posted at http://cancergenome.nih.gov) are coordinated with those
of the ICGC, TCGA’s participation in the ICGC is considered to be
equivalent to that of a full member. TCGA, however, is not able to
join the ICGC formally at this time, because of technical and legal
issues in the US related to the mechanisms of the distribution of
controlled-access data, although such data are directly available to
investigators at http://cancergenome.nih.gov/dataportal. The National
Institutes of Health (NIH) policies relating to distribution of con-
trolled-access data sets are being reviewed with the intent of enabling
researchers to integrate and analyse across databases, for example,
using the franchise model adopted by the ICGC. Meanwhile, TCGA

is ensuring that projects are coordinated and data sets are compatible
with those of the consortium.

ICGC in the next decade
A large proportion of common cancers affecting patients around the
world have been or will soon be selected for comprehensive cancer
genome studies. Further efforts will be needed to leverage support
and expertise to tackle the remaining tumour types, including rare
cancers. The challenges of the ICGC are daunting owing to the scope
of the initiative, the complexity that is inherent to the heterogeneity
of cancer, and the limitations of current technologies to provide
accurate long-range assemblies of highly rearranged chromosomes
found in tumour cells. These challenges underscore the importance
of continued international coordination and further engagement of
the scientific community in the next decade.

Moving towards clinical applications
ICGC catalogues, which are expected to grow exponentially, will have
immediate relevance in the cancer research community. Early insight
into the biology of somatic mutations will come from functional
studies in cell-based and animal models of tumours. Mutation
screens in retrospective tumour banks linked to registries or clinical
trials having significant clinical data will inform on the potential
clinical utility of somatic mutations as biomarkers for prognosis or
drug-response. Germline variants identified by ICGC projects may
allow the discovery of genes predisposing to familial malignancies,
such as PALB2 and pancreatic cancer12,34. High throughput screens of
RNA interference or small molecule libraries, and the adaptation of
existing model systems, will have a major role in refining potential
therapeutic candidates for further study35.

Translating these discoveries into clinical practice will require more
sophisticated clinical trials that take into account the increases in
phenotypic subdivisions, further coordination to identify subjects
having tumours with similar profiles, and increased use of biomarkers,
genomic analyses, informatics and other technologies in the clinical
development of new therapeutics. Given the tremendous potential for
relatively low-cost genomic sequencing to reveal clinically useful
information, we anticipate that in the not so distant future, partial
or full cancer genomes will routinely be sequenced as part of the
clinical evaluation of cancer patients and as part of their continuing
clinical management. The successful and appropriate translation of
cancer genome research into clinical practice will raise important
social and ethical questions. It will be essential to combine the expertise
of oncologists, biostatisticians, pathologists, geneticists, policy-makers
and members of the biopharmaceutical industry to meet this challenge
by developing new policies and clinical models that enable rapid trans-
lation of many new biomarkers and cancer targets into new clinical
tests and therapeutic interventions that will benefit cancer patients.
