The power and the promise of 
oncogene-induced senescence 
markers

Manuel Collado and Manuel Serrano

Abstract | Recently, it has been shown that oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) 
occurs during the early stages of tumorigenesis. Senescent tumour cells are 
abundant within premalignant neoplastic lesions, whereas they are scarce in 
malignant tumours. This association of senescence with the premalignant stages 
of tumour progression opens the possibility of using senescence markers as 
diagnostic and prognostic tools. Moreover, some chemotherapeutic protocols 
induce senescence in tumour cells and, consequently, senescence markers could 
help to monitor treatment response.

Senescence is a cellular stress response
The concept of senescence was first applied 
to the irreversible growth arrest of cells 
after prolonged proliferation under in vitro, 
non-physiological conditions1. Now this 
concept is applied in general to the irrevers-
ible proliferate arrest of cells caused by 
various stresses2, including oxidative damage, 
telomere dysfunction, DNA damage and 
several chemotherapeutic drugs (such as 
doxorubicin or cisplatin, which affect DNA 
structure, or taxol and vincristine, which tar-
get microtubules; reviewed in REF. 3) (FIG. 1). 
Tumour cells are exposed to many sources of 
stress, therefore the induction of senescence 
could constitute an important block to 
tumour progression. One particularly rele-
vant source of stress is derived from the aber-
rant proliferative signals of oncogenes, which 
might eventually trigger senescence through 
a process known as oncogene-induced senes-
cence (OIS)4,5. Ever since its original descrip-
tion, the possibility that OIS functioned as 
a potential tumour-suppressor mechanism 
seemed logical, but the detection of its 
occurrence during tumorigenesis remained 
elusive. This has changed after several recent 
reports established that OIS occurs during 
the early stages of tumour development both 
in mouse models and in humans6–9. These 
observations strongly indicate that OIS 

restricts the growth of oncogenically stressed 
cells, therefore maintaining the tumour in 
a non-aggressive, premalignant, state; by 
contrast, the absence of OIS, which is caused 
by the mutation of the senescence-inducing 
pathways, leaves the road to oncogene-driven 
malignant progression unimpeded6,7. The 
association of senescence with premalignant 
lesions (characterized by normal cell mor-
phology and a lack of invasive growth) makes 
the detection of senescence an attractive 
biomarker that could serve as a prognostic 
indicator. It should be noted that the occur-
rence of senescence in premalignant tumours 
is not incompatible with the growth of the 
tumour. We envision a scenario in which 
only a fraction of the cells within a tumour 
are able to propagate successfully, while many 
undergo apoptosis or senescence triggered 
by the stress associated with the aberrant 
intracellular and extracellular conditions 
that are characteristically present in tumours 
(FIG. 2). After all, it is the balance between 
proliferation and apoptosis or senescence that 
determines the growth rate of a particular 
tumour.

Oncogenic levels and senescence
Most studies of OIS have relied on the 
overexpression of activated oncogenes, 
and it might have come as a surprise to 

find that normal endogenous levels of 
an activated oncogene do not trigger 
senescence10,11. This leaves us with several 
questions that remain to be answered. For 
example, how much oncogenic activity 
is necessary to induce senescence? How 
much oncogenic activity is needed for neo-
plastic transformation? And finally, how 
do these levels compare with each other? 
It is important to bear in mind that the 
normal endogenous expression level of an 
activated oncogene is not only insufficient 
to trigger senescence, but is also extremely 
inefficient in the generation of tumours. 
For example, mice carrying endogenous 
activated KRAS develop premalignant 
lung lesions after months of latency, and 
few lesions progress to be fully malignant 
tumours10. This reflects, in part, the need 
for further stochastic mutations, but this is 
certainly not the whole story. 

Oncogenic signalling is transmitted 
through complex cascades of mediators 
that have ample opportunities for self-
attenuation through negative-feedback 
regulation. Consequently, the activation of 
an endogenous oncogene does not neces-
sarily translate into the full activation of 
its downstream effectors; a more realistic 
scenario is one in which the influence of a 
particular oncogene on its downstream effec-
tors increases progressively during tumour 
development, which reflects the cumulative 
loss of negative-feedback regulators. In this 
sense, the Sprouty family of genes, which are 
induced by Ras and inhibit Ras signalling, are 
frequently inactivated during tumour progres-
sion12. Similarly, some members of the dual-
specificity family of phosphatases are induced 
by Ras and are negative regulators of mitogen 
activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, 
therefore opposing oncogenic Ras activity13,14. 
We propose that oncogenic stress increases 
progressively during tumour development and 
that senescence is triggered at a point when 
tumours have already been initiated, but have 
not reached a fully malignant phenotype.

Current markers of senescence
The study of senescence has yielded several 
markers that are useful for the detection 
of this response not only in vitro but also 
in vivo (TABLE 1).

Senescence

Figure 1 | Many roads to senescence. Diverse factors can engage a common programme the end 
point of which is the establishment of an irreversible proliferative arrest known as senescence. All of 
these stimuli represent stressful conditions for the cell, many of which are present in the tumour envi-
ronment. Senescence functions as a self-defence mechanism to prevent the proliferation of potentially 
damaged cells. In some instances, the same stimulus might induce either senescence or apoptosis, but 
the mechanisms that govern the decision to engage one or the other are not known.

of intense research and many reagents for 
their detection have been developed in 
recent years. Increased expression levels of 
p16INK4a, ARF and p53 have been found 
in murine tissues with cells undergoing 
OIS, as well as in human premalignant 
neoplastic lesions6–9,23. These proteins 
can be regarded as being at the top of the 
senescence cascade and, precisely because 
of this, there are situations in which the 
tumour cell could have acquired down-
stream mutations that block senescence 
despite high levels of p16INK4a or ARF. 
For example, some malignant tumours 
might overexpress p16INK4a, but this 
overexpression could be inconsequential 
if the tumour lacks RB (see for example 

P E R S P E C T I V E S

REFS 24,25). This situation highlights the 
convenience of markers that, in contrast to 
p16INK4a or ARF, are not involved in the 
initiation of senescence but are associated 
with the final endpoint of senescence.

Senescence-associated heterochromatin 
foci. The basis for the irreversibility of 
the proliferative arrest that characterizes 
senescence has been the subject of intense 
research. Only recently, however, has a 
mechanism with the power to impose such 
a strict control over proliferation been put 
forward26. This mechanism consists of a 
global alteration of the chromatin initiated 
by RB and results in the permanent and 
stable repression of genes with crucial roles 
in proliferation, such as those regulated 
by the E2F family of transcription factors. 
This genomic alteration can be micro-
scopically visualized by the appearance of 
clusters of DAPI-stained heterochromatic 
regions known as senescence-associated 
heterochromatic foci (SAHF). SAHFs bear 
the hallmarks of heterochromatin, such as 
the trimethylation of lysine 9 in histone 3 
(H3K9me3) (REF. 26), or the recruitment 
of heterochromatin protein 1-γ (HP1γ 
also known as chromobox homologue 3 
(CBX3)) (REF. 26) and macroH2A histone27. 
Whether SAHFs always occur in response 
to OIS and what the detailed mechanisms 
are that enable their formation are ques-
tions that remain to be answered. Despite 
this, SAHFs constitute a morphological 
feature of the nuclei of senescent cells that 
have been successfully exploited to identify 
the occurrence of OIS in vivo6,8,23.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase. 
The most widely used assay for senes-
cence is the cytochemical detection of 
β-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0, termed 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase 
(SA-β-Gal)15. β-Galactosidase activity 
is derived from the increased lysosomal 
content of senescent cells, which enables 
the detection of lysosomal β-galactosidase 
at a suboptimal pH, pH 6.0 (pH 4.0 is opti-
mal)16. β-Galactosidase activity is generally 
accepted as a marker of senescence both 
in vitro and in vivo, although its biochemi-
cal basis is still unknown and there is evi-
dence for a positive SA-β-Gal reaction in 
settings of cellular stress that are unrelated 
to senescence, such as serum withdrawal or 
high confluency in cell culture17. SA-β-Gal 
activity is normally assayed in cultured 
cells or tissue sections using the chromog-
enic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl 
β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal)15, or the 
fluorescent analogue fluorescein-di-β-d-
galactopyranoside (FDG)18. The value of 
histochemical SA-β-Gal staining has been 
further proven by its capacity to detect 
OIS in murine and human premalignant 
neoplastic lesions6–9.

p16INK4a–RB and ARF–p53 pathways. 
Investigation of the signalling pathways 
leading to OIS has shown that two main 
pathways are involved, p16INK4a–RB 
(retinoblastoma) and ARF–p53, which 
are responsible for the execution of the 
proliferative arrest that characterizes 
senescence19. These two pathways are 
thought to be crucial for tumour suppres-
sion and are often mutated in tumours20–22. 
Consequently, they have been the focus

cells that undergo apoptosis (shown in purple) or senescence (shown in blue) within premalig-
nant lesions. These cells are probably responsible for the restriction of the growth of these 
lesions. By contrast, in most malignant tumours, the balance between proliferating (shown in 
brown) versus apoptotic and senescent cells is altered in favour of proliferation and, therefore, 
tumour progression.

p15INK4b, DCR2 and DEC1. Recently, 
we have reported new markers of OIS 
that could help to describe this process 
in vivo8. To this end, we generated cell lines 
that were either competent to undergo 
senescence or that carried engineered 
modifications that resulted in the bypass of 
senescence. By using DNA microarrays, we 
selected those changes in gene expression 
that only took place during senescence, 
but not when senescence was inhibited. 
In this manner, we compiled a shortlist of 
candidate OIS markers that were tested 
in several mouse models of tumorigen-
esis that are driven by the expression of 
endogenous oncogenic HRAS or KRAS. 
Some of these new markers — the cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor p15INK4b, the 
decoy death DCR2 and the transcription 
factor differentiated embryo-chondrocyte 
expressed (DEC1) — showed an increased 
level of expression specifically in pre-
malignant neoplastic lesions of the skin, 
lung and pancreas, but not in malignant 
tumours8. The high levels of these markers 
correlated well with the presence of SA-β-
Gal activity and of SAHFs, which confirms 
their value in identifying the occurrence 
of OIS in vivo. In addition, p15INK4b was 
previously described as being involved in 
the growth arrest that is imposed during 
Ras-induced senescence and was shown 
to oppose transformation by Ras, at least 
in cultured cells28. The functional involve-
ment of DCR2 (REF. 29) and of DEC1 
(REF. 30) is currently unknown. DCR2 is a 
p53-induced gene and is one of the tumour 
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand (TRAIL) decoy receptors. It sup-
presses TRAIL-induced apoptosis and has 
been shown to regulate chemosensitivity31.

DEC1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-
helix family of transcription factors and 
it has been shown to be involved in the 
control of circadian rhythms, but it also 
seems to be involved in many different sig-
nalling pathways32. An advantage of these 
markers is that, in contrast to SA-β-Gal 
or SAHFs, they can be readily detected in 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections 
using standard immunohistochemistry 
techniques.

Other markers. Several reports have 
described the identification of additional 
OIS markers. In a previous effort to iden-
tify potential tumour suppressors that are 
involved in RAS-induced senescence, our 
group found that the expression of Ras-
induced senescence 1 (RIS1) is increased 
during growth arrest triggered by the over-
expression of oncogenic HRAS in human 
primary cells33. This increase was only 
observed after the expression of oncogenic 
HRAS and was not related to replicative 
senescence or ageing of the organism. 
RIS1 has been independently identified 
as a brain-specific membrane-receptor 
protein34. However, its role in senescence 
is still unknown and its value as a marker 
in vivo still needs to be proved. Similarly, 
other senescence markers have not yet 
been validated in vivo. This is the case with 
lipofuscin (an autofluorescent lysosomal 
pigment that is associated with certain 
processes of ageing35), which accumulates 
during senescence and has been related 
to the increased lysosomal content of 
senescent cells36. Also, plasminogen activa-
tor inhibitor 1 (PAI1), an inhibitor of the 
activity of the urokinase-type plasminogen 
activator protease, uPA, is upregulated 

during replicative senescence37 and during 
Ras-induced senescence4. Other changes 
in extracellular-matrix components have 
been described during the senescence of 
cells in culture, such as increased levels 
of expression of matrix metalloproteinase 
3 (MMP3) and collagenase, or decreased 
levels of expression of tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), but neither 
their occurrence in vivo nor their potential 
value as OIS markers has been properly 
addressed. Investigation of the signalling 
pathways that lead to OIS has revealed 
several important players that, similar 
to p16INK4a or ARF, are involved in the 
initiation of senescence, such as the pro-
myelocitic leukaemia protein (PML), or the 
transcription factors ID1, ETS1 and ETS2, 
JUN and DMP1. However, as discussed 
above, the value of these molecules as 
markers of senescence is limited because 
downstream alterations can cancel their 
effects on senescence. Finally, there are 
other proteins, such as those controlling 
the G2–M checkpoint38, that are strongly 
downregulated and therefore their use as 
markers is less straightforward.

Senescence markers in action
Most of the chemotherapeutic agents used 
in the clinic are assumed to exert their 
anti-tumour effect through the induction of 
apoptosis. However, it has been known for a 
long time that chemotherapeutic drugs can 
also trigger senescence, occasionally named 
chemotherapy-induced premature senes-
cence39. Indeed, senescence has a relevant part 
in the anti-tumour effect of standard chemo-
therapeutic drugs (reviewed in REFS 3,40). 
An emerging theme is that chemotherapeutic 
drugs trigger senescence when they are used 
at low doses, and trigger apoptosis when 
they are used at higher doses39,41,42. Another 
factor that determines the outcome of chemo-
therapy is the genetic makeup of the tumour 
cells. In this regard, it has been shown in mice 
that the same chemotherapeutic treatment 
prevents tumour progression either by induc-
ing apoptosis or by inducing senescence, 
depending on the genetic alterations that are 
present in the tumour40. In the case of human 
tumours, it is of particular importance that 
senescence induced by chemotherapy has 
been shown to be a relevant factor in deter-
mining treatment outcome for breast and 
lung carcinoma43,44. Therefore, senescence-
inducing drugs could represent an attractive 
alternative approach to treat tumours that are 
resistant to apoptosis-based therapies. In this 
scenario, senescence markers could be used to 
monitor the efficacy of these therapies.

be a double-edged sword, both limiting the 
proliferation of the tumour cells, but at the 
same time promoting the proliferation of 
non-responsive tumour cells.

Finally, although senescent cells in vitro 
have been shown to be viable and metaboli-
cally active over long periods of time, the 
situation in vivo might be very different. 
Most cells in the body are constantly 
renewed and it would be very informative to 
know if (and the mechanism through which) 
oncogenically stressed senescent cells are 
eliminated from a tumour and if their fate is 
altered after chemotherapeutic treatment.

Conclusions
The activation of OIS during tumorigenesis 
limits cancer progression. Accordingly, 
senescent cells are abundant in premalig-
nant neoplastic lesions whereas they are 
almost completely absent in more advanced 
tumours. The specific association of senes-
cent cells with premalignant lesions provides 
a unique opportunity to use senescence as an 
indicator of the early stages of tumorigenesis. 
The markers that have been identified dur-
ing the study of OIS could assist in cancer 
staging and treatment. In addition, the 
finding that chemotherapeutic drugs might 
induce senescence in tumour cells opens the 
possibility of using these markers to monitor 
the efficacy of therapy. The identification of 
additional specific markers of OIS and the 
evaluation of their value in diagnosis and 
prognosis is a future prospect that could 
expand our ability to fight cancer.

as-yet-untested possibility is the use of DNA-
damage-response markers in the context of 
OIS in vivo. The accumulation of unrepaired 
DNA damage during ageing, as is shown by 
the presence of γH2AX foci, has been linked 
to senescence in cell cultures and in ageing 
organisms45. At the same time, DNA-damag-
ing agents have the ability to induce senes-
cence in normal and tumour cells43.

Another exciting possibility is the 

identification of soluble factors released by 
senescent cells that could, for example, be 
measured in body fluids such us blood, urine 
or sputum. Thanks to the analysis of the 
gene-expression profile of senescent cells, it 
has become clear that senescent cells have 
characteristic alterations in secreted growth 
factors, inflammatory cytokines, extracellu-
lar-matrix components and matrix-degrad-
ing enzymes, some of which could be easily 
detected, and would facilitate the study of 
OIS (see, for example, REFS 39,46). This is 
especially attractive because it could provide 
a non-invasive method to monitor the onset 
of OIS, as well as the response of tumours to 
senescence-inducing therapy.

An important consideration that needs to 
be made in regard to the use of OIS markers 
to monitior the efficacy of chemotherapy is 
that senescent cells could favour the growth 
of adjacent or neighbouring tumour cells47. 
If this is proved to be the case then the 
induction of senescence in tumours could

ple, active caspase-3 staining) or undergoing senescence (for example, using senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining). An ‘index’ could be derived from the results of these assays and 
would represent the percentage of cells within a tumour that are part of the pro-malignant state 
(‘proliferative index’; brown cells (a)), together with the percentage of cells that restrict tumour growth, 
represented by apoptosis (‘apoptotic index’; brown cells (b)) or senescence (‘senescence index’; blue 
cells (c)). The images are intended only for illustrative purposes and are not from the same tumour.

The concept of a ‘senescence index’.
The use of OIS markers in the clinic could be 
useful in detecting cancer at early stages, and 
the loss of these markers would be indicative 
of tumour progression to a malignant stage. 
We would like to propose the concept of a 
‘senescence index’ to be applied to tumours 
to indicate  the grade and extent to which 
a tumour undergoes senescence (FIG. 3). 
Theoretically, tumours that have a high 
senescence index would have a better prog-
nosis than tumours with a low senescence 
index, which would be associated with more 
aggressive lesions that require immediate 
therapeutic intervention. Although the use 
of a similar ‘apoptotic index’ has not been as 
informative as was originally hoped, it will 
be interesting to see whether the induction 
of senescence is a better prognostic marker.

Future directions
Significant advances in our understanding 
of the process of OIS have been achieved 
in recent years , but further research could 
still provide new molecular tools. The 
information that is available regarding the 
different pathways implicated in OIS should 
be exploited to obtain new senescence 
markers. For example, modifications to 
protein-degradation pathways (through the 
proteasome and the lysosome), the epigenetic 
status of the chromatin, cell-cycle arrest and 
others should be further investigated. An

Genetics as a tool to improve cancer 
outcomes: ethics and policy

Wylie Burke and Nancy Press 

Abstract | Genetic research is rapidly increasing the opportunities for the 
detection of inherited cancer risk. Clinicians and policy makers must ensure 
the adequate evaluation of the benefits and harms of this new area of 
practice, address the challenges of family-based detection of individuals at 
risk and develop practice guidelines and educational strategies that are 
responsive to rapidly changing knowledge. When the benefits of testing are 
well established, efforts must also be made to ensure access to genetic 
services for all who can benefit.

An increasing number of genetic tests pro-
vide information about cancer risk. These 
tests identify inherited susceptibilities to 
cancer, and can also guide clinical manage-
ment and provide prognostic information1–6 
(TABLE 1). As with other medical innovations, 
clinicians and policy makers seek to identify 
clinical uses that will maximize benefit and 
minimize harm.

The evaluation of genetic tests often 

raises difficult questions. A particular gene 
variant might result in multiple cancer risks, 
and the effect could be modified by genetic 
or non-genetic risk factors. In addition, 
testing can only improve cancer outcomes if 
there are measures to reduce risk or improve 
treatment. As a result, the outcome of test-
ing is highly dependent on the potential for
