A role for the membrane/cytoskeleton interface in the development and progression of cancer is established,
yet poorly understood. The neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes a member of the
ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins thought to be important for
cell adhesion and motility. We report that in contrast to the narrow spectrum of benign tumors in human NF2
patients, Nf2 heterozygous mice develop a variety of malignant tumors. Using the fact that Nf2 is linked to
the p53 tumor suppressor locus in the mouse we have also investigated the effects of genetic linkage of
cancer-predisposing mutations on tumorigenesis and examined the genetic pathway to tumor formation
involving Nf2 loss. Importantly, we observed a very high rate of metastasis associated with Nf2 deficiency,
with or without loss of p53 function, and we provide experimental evidence supporting a role for Nf2 loss in
metastatic potential. Together, our results suggest an important role for the NF2 tumor suppressor, and
perhaps the ERM family in tumor formation and metastasis.

Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a dominantly inher-
ited disorder featuring the predisposition to develop mul-
tiple benign tumors of the central nervous system. The
hallmark feature of NF2 is the development of bilateral
schwannomas of the eighth cranial (auditory) nerves;
NF2 patients are also predisposed to the development of
spinal schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas
at rates much higher than that of the normal population
(Huson 1994). The NF2 tumor suppressor gene was iden-
tified by positional cloning and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) studies and found to encode a member of the band
4.1 family of cytoskeletal-associated proteins thought to
be involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton
(Rouleau et al. 1993; Trofatter et al. 1993). The NF2 gene
product shares closest similarity to ezrin, radixin, and
moesin (the ERM proteins), which comprise a subset of
this family, and thus was given the name merlin (moe-
sin-, ezrin-, and radixin-like protein)
(Trofatter et al.
1993). The amino-terminal halves of these proteins share
the greatest similarity (the band 4.1 domain), with ~85%

amino acid identity among the ERMs (for review, see
Tsukita et al. 1997; Vaheri et al. 1997).

The ERM proteins localize to cortical actin structures,
particularly specialized or dynamic regions, such as
membrane ruffles, microvilli, or the cleavage furrow and
can bind directly to actin through a highly conserved
motif at their extreme carboxyl terminus (for review, see
Tsukita et al. 1997; Vaheri et al. 1997). The ERM pro-
teins may be rendered inactive by an intramolecular as-
sociation; certain stimuli such as phosphorylation or
phosphatidyl-4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP2) binding may serve
to ‘‘open up’’ the protein conformation, allowing homo-
or heterodimerization, which has been shown to occur
under certain conditions (Gary and Bretscher 1993). All
three ERM proteins have been shown to bind to the
transmembrane protein CD44, providing a direct link
between the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane (Tsu-
kita et al. 1994). Although ERM function has been linked
to a number of cellular activities, including the motility,
cell/substrate, and cell/cell adhesion of epithelial cells;
immortalization of fibroblasts; and the sensitization of
target cells to killing by natural killer cells; there re-
mains no consensus concerning the molecular function
of these proteins (Helander et al. 1996). Recent evidence
suggests that they may participate in the Rho GTPase

signaling network that controls such diverse cellular ac-
tivities as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, cell
proliferation, and membrane trafficking (Hirao et al.
1996; Mackay et al. 1997; Takahashi et al. 1997; Matsui
et al. 1998).

In contrast, much less is known about merlin, which
does not contain the carboxy-terminal actin-binding mo-
tif found in the ERM proteins, but does localize to cor-
tical actin structures and is particularly enriched in
membrane ruffles (Gonzalez-Agosti et al. 1996; R.J.
Shaw, A.I. McClatchey, T. Jacks, in prep.). The mouse
and human NF2 proteins are highly related, sharing 98%
amino acid identity (Haase et al. 1994; Claudio et al.
1997). Moreover, a Drosophila homolog of the NF2 pro-
tein, dmerlin, shares 55% amino acid identity with hu-
man merlin and localizes to endocytic vesicles, implying
a role for merlin in the formation or trafficking of those
structures (McCartney and Fehon 1996). It has been re-
ported that reduction of merlin expression by antisense
oligonucleotides reduces the adhesion and increases the
proliferation of Schwann-like cells, and that overexpres-
sion of merlin leads to growth arrest of fibroblasts
(Lutchman and Rouleau 1995; Huynh and Pulst 1996). In
addition, we have determined that merlin is a phospho-
protein; serine/threonine phosphorylation of merlin is
modulated by a number of stimuli in cell culture, includ-
ing the availability of growth factors, confluency, and by
cell adhesion (Shaw et al. 1998). Despite these observa-
tions, the molecular nature of merlin function remains
poorly understood. However, given its identity as a tu-
mor suppressor protein, the study of the NF2 gene prod-
uct represents an avenue into the poorly understood in-
terface between the proliferative state of the cell and the
cytoskeleton, which must reorganize during the pro-
cesses of cell division and differentiation, as well as dur-
ing the transformation and invasion stages of malig-
nancy.

To develop a system through which to study the func-
tion of merlin, we have targeted the disruption of the
mouse Nf2 gene and investigated the consequences of
merlin loss in mouse tumorigenesis and development.
Previously, we have reported a requirement for merlin
function at the initiation of gastrulation during embryo-
genesis (McClatchey et al. 1997). Here, we describe dra-
matic tumorigenic and metastatic consequences of loss
of merlin function in adult animals. These results are
surprising given the rather limited association between
merlin loss and cancer development in humans and this
implies a very important role for this pathway specifi-
cally, and the membrane/cytoskeletal interface gener-
ally, in cancer development and progression.

Results

Nf2 heterozygous mice are cancer prone

Previously, we have described the generation of a tar-
geted mutation at the mouse Nf2 locus by homologous
recombination in ES cells (McClatchey et al. 1997). This
mutation, designed to mimic germ-line mutations iden-

tified in human NF2 patients (for review, see Gusella et
al. 1996), was introduced into D3 129/SvPas ES cells by
homologous recombination (Simpson et al. 1997). Nei-
ther full-length nor aberrantly sized Nf2 protein was de-
tected by Western blot analysis of cell extracts from Nf2
homozygous mutant ES cells or tumor cells displaying
loss of the wild-type Nf2 allele (McClatchey et al. 1997;
see below for derivation of tumor cells). Furthermore, a
homozygous mutation at the mouse Nf2 locus leads to
embryonic failure immediately before gastrulation, indi-
cating that merlin function is critical at a very early
stage in development (McClatchey et al. 1997).

One of the original motivations for targeting the
mouse Nf2 locus was to attempt to create an animal
model for human NF2. We generated 99 Nf2 +/− and 23
wild-type F1 (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) siblings, and 37 inbred
129/Sv Nf2 +/− animals by breeding chimeras derived
from each of three original targeted ES cell clones to
wild-type C57BL/6 or 129/Sv animals (identical results
were obtained for animals derived from each of the three
ES cell clones; see Materials and Methods for a descrip-
tion of the 129Sv substrain used). We also generated 45
Nf2 +/− F2 animals by intercrossing Nf2 +/− F1 mice. Nf2
heterozygous mice were monitored closely for the devel-
opment of tumors over the course of nearly 3 years and
found to be cancer prone. Figure 1A illustrates the de-
creased survival of Nf2 heterozygous F1 mice compared
to their wild-type siblings. Fifty percent of F1 Nf2 het-
erozygotes died or were sacrificed by the age of 22.4
months (672 days), whereas 50% of their wild-type sib-
lings survived to 27.3 months (818 days). Inbred 129/Sv
Nf2 heterozygotes exhibit an additional decrease in sur-
vival (median, 20.3 months or 608 days; data not shown).
Interestingly, we found a statistically significant de-
crease in the survival of females compared to males,
which is most pronounced on the inbred 129/Sv back-
ground (one-tailed t test; t = 3.199; P = 0.0008 for total
males vs. females). This may be explained at least in part
by tissue-specific biases in tumor development (see be-
low).

In contrast to human NF2 patients, Nf2 +/− mice de-
veloped a variety of malignant tumors later in life (10–30
months). The spectrum of tumors observed in Nf2 +/− F1
(C57BL/6 × 129Sv) mice is depicted in Table 1; 63% de-
veloped osteosarcoma, followed by lymphoma (15%; see
legend to Table 1), lung adenocarcinoma (10%), hepato-
cellular carcinoma (9%), and fibrosarcoma (9%; see leg-
end to Table 1). The tumor spectrum in inbred Nf2 +/−
129/Sv animals was very similar to that of F1 animals
(not shown). Lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma were
common tumors that arose in wild-type F1 control ani-
mals (30% and 44%, respectively). As discussed below,
these cancers are likely to be spontaneous background
tumors in Nf2 heterozygotes whose occurrence is unre-
lated to the loss of Nf2 function. The frequency of osteo-
sarcoma was significantly higher in Nf2 +/− F1 and 129/
Sv females than in males (F1: 77% vs. 56%; 129/Sv: 84%
vs. 67%), whereas fibrosarcomas arose predominantly in
males (Table 1). The average age of death of 129/Sv fe-
males with osteosarcomas was 18.7 months, compared

to 23 months for males, suggesting an earlier onset or
more rapid growth of osteosarcomas in females. This dif-
ference may reflect known effects of estrogen on bone
growth (for review, see Rizzoli and Bonjour 1997). In con-
trast, a strong bias for hepatocellular carcinoma develop-
ment in males was observed, consistent with chemically
induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, which predomi-
nantly affects males (Frith and Ward 1979). The reduced
frequency of lung adenocarcinoma and lymphoma in Nf2
+/− mice compared to controls probably reflects the de-
velopment of earlier onset osteosarcomas in these ani-
mals.

To determine whether tumor formation in the Nf2
heterozygous mutant mice was dependent on the so-
matic mutation of the wild-type Nf2 allele, we per-
formed Southern blotting on a panel of tumor DNAs.
Nearly all of the osteosarcomas and fibrosarcomas ana-
lyzed displayed loss of the wild-type Nf2 allele (LOH;
11/12 and 11/11, respectively; Fig. 1D), consistent with
a role for loss of Nf2 function in the etiology of those
tumor types. In addition, hepatocellular carcinomas,
which were markedly more frequent in our Nf2 hetero-
zygotes compared to wild-type controls (Table 1), usually
displayed LOH at the Nf2 locus (78%; 7/9 analyzed by
Southern blotting). Hepatocellular adenoma of the liver
was also observed in wild-type control mice (13%; 3/23);

however, these tumors apparently did not progress to
high-grade malignant hepatocellular carcinoma. The Nf2
heterozygotes also developed hepatocellular adenomas
(6%; 10/181), which failed to undergo Nf2 LOH. The
reduced frequency of hepatocellular adenoma and in-
creased frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma in Nf2
heterozygotes suggests that Nf2 loss contributes to the
progression to a highly malignant lesion. However, it is
also possible that Nf2 mutation leads to the develop-
ment of an inherently more aggressive tumor type de
novo. In contrast, lung adenocarcinoma and lymphoma
(including lymphoblastic, lymphocytic, and follicle cen-
ter cell), which were frequent tumors in both wild-type
and Nf2 +/− animals, do not display loss of the wild-type
Nf2 allele, as would be expected for a background tumor.
Osteosarcomas in Nf2 +/− mice were histologically
consistent with osteoblastic or osteogenic sarcomas and
arose predominantly within the craniofacial bones and
vertebral column, often causing paralysis. These tumors
were often highly differentiated, containing large
amounts of mineralized bone forming mature trabecu-
lae, and exhibiting fairly low cellularity (Fig. 1B). Fibro-
sarcomas in Nf2 heterozygotes exhibited a spectrum of
features consistent with fibrosarcomas and/or rhabdo-
myosarcomas, including a range of nuclear morphology
(spindly to plump), cytoplasm (limited to extensive eo-

sinophilic), and the presence or absence of strap-like
cells. Given that we observed this range of features when
comparing individual tumors or regions within the same
tumor, we have not attempted to subclassify them and
will refer to them collectively as fibrosarcomas. Al-
though the frequency of this tumor type in Nf2 +/− F1
mice does not appear to be markedly increased (9%;
Table 1), the frequency of fibrosarcomas seen in our
wild-type animals (9%, 2/23; see Table 1) is higher than
that seen in other F1 control populations from our labo-
ratory (not shown) and is likely to be an overrepresenta-
tion of the true background frequency in F1 animals. The
hepatocellular carcinomas that exhibited loss of the
wild-type Nf2 allele were of the high grade, trabecular
form (Fig. 1C; Frith and Ward 1979).

Importantly, we did not detect any schwannomas, me-
ningiomas, or ependymomas in the Nf2 +/− animals, de-
spite examining a sagittal section of the spinal cord and
head of each mouse and serial sections (4 µm) through
the entire length of both eighth cranial nerves of eight
animals. We also examined the lenses of 7 Nf2 +/− and
10 Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− animals (see below) at high power on
a dissecting microscope. Although examples of lens fiber
disorganization were seen, we did not observe consis-
tently obvious cataracts analogous to those common in
human Nf2 patients (D.C. Beebe, pers. comm.). Thus,
these animals do not represent a histopathologically ac-
curate model for human NF2, but they reveal other cell
types requiring the growth suppressive properties of mer-
lin, and confirm the function of merlin as a tumor sup-
pressor in the mouse.
Nf2-deficient tumors are highly metastatic

A striking feature of the tumors that developed in the

1124

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

Nf2 +/− mice was their high frequency of metastasis to
distant sites such as the lung and liver. This was unex-
pected given the generally low rate of metastasis associ-
ated with endogenously arising tumors in the mouse
(Frith et al. 1981). Histologically, we found that nearly
all of the osteosarcomas (95% or 61/64 in F1 animals;
90% or 104/115 overall) in Nf2 +/− mice metastasized.
Although the primary sites of metastasis were the lung
and liver, we also frequently found pockets of tumor
cells in the kidney and occasionally in the spleen. Many
of the osteosarcomas that metastasized in these mice
were relatively small, well-differentiated primary tu-
mors exhibiting a high ratio of extracellular matrix (cal-
cified bone) to cell nuclei, such as the one in Figure 1B.
The metastases were also often highly differentiated (Fig.
2, cf. B and C with A), frequently more so than the pri-
mary tumor. In addition, 64% (7/11) of the fibrosarco-
mas that exhibited LOH at the Nf2 locus, and 57% (4/7)
of the hepatocellular carcinomas that exhibited LOH at
the Nf2 locus, metastasized (neither of the 2/9 hepato-
cellular carcinomas found to retain the wild-type allele
metastasized). For comparison, one study revealed that
13% (4/30) of the osteosarcomas and 0% (0/36) of the
fibrosarcomas arising in p53 +/− or wild-type animals on
a similar genetic background metastasized (Taverna et
al. 1998). Osteosarcomas and fibrosarcomas in wild-type
mice have been reported to metastasize with frequencies
of 4%–46% and 18%, respectively, depending on the
method of induction and the genetic background (Frith
et al. 1981; Luz et al. 1991). Notably, two of the wild-
type F1 control mice developed fibrosarcomas, neither of
which metastasized. Taken together, these observations
strongly suggest that Nf2-deficient tumor cells possess a
marked propensity to metastasize and raise the possibil-

ity that loss of merlin function is somehow increasing
metastatic potential in this tumor model (see below).

Cooperativity between an Nf2 mutation
and a mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene

Given the relatively late onset of tumorigenesis in Nf2
heterozygotes, we investigated the possibility that mu-
tations in other tumor suppressor genes might cooperate
with an Nf2 mutation to accelerate or alter the spectrum
of tumorigenesis in these mice. Nf2 heterozygous mice
were mated to mice carrying a mutation in the p53 tu-
mor suppressor gene (Jacks et al. 1994). p53 heterozygous
mice develop a number of sarcomas including osteo-,
fibro-, and hemangiosarcomas between the ages of 9 and
24 months (Donehower et al. 1992; Jacks et al. 1994). In
contrast to humans, the mouse Nf2 and p53 loci are
linked, residing at a significant genetic distance from one
another on chromosome 11 (~40 cM; Dietrich et al. 1996;
Fig. 3A). Given that the loss of an entire chromosome is
a relatively frequent event during mouse tumorigenesis
(Luongo et al. 1994), we investigated the tumorigenic
phenotype of mice that carry mutations in the Nf2 and
p53 genes on the same chromosome 11 (in cis) and on
opposite chromosomes 11 (in trans). This allowed us to
address the importance of the configuration of the two
mutations, in addition to the overall genetic load.

We intercrossed Nf2 and p53 singly heterozygous
mice, generating Nf2;p53 double heterozygotes carrying
the mutations in trans (Fig. 3B). These trans mice were
then mated with wild-type mice. Compound heterozy-

gous progeny from this cross reflect the occurrence of
meiotic recombination between the two loci, placing the
mutations on the same chromosome 11 (in cis). We gen-
erated Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis mice with a frequency of 18%
from this cross, reflecting the genetic distance between
the two loci (37.6% of the mice from this cross were
compound heterozygous or wild type, reflecting the total
number of recombination events and agreeing roughly
with the predicted genetic distance of ~40 cM between
Nf2 and p53 in the mouse; Dietrich et al. 1996). Fifty-
three Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis and 31 Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans
mice representing both C57BL/6:129/Sv F1 and inbred
129/Sv genetic backgrounds were then aged and moni-
tored for signs of disease. No obvious differences be-
tween the two genetic backgrounds were observed.

Mice carrying mutations at the Nf2 and p53 tumor
suppressor loci in cis rapidly developed multiple tumors
and died by 5 months of age, exhibiting dramatically
reduced survival compared to that of Nf2 or p53 singly
heterozygous mutant animals or to that of mice carrying
Nf2 and p53 mutations in trans (Fig. 3C). Using histo-
logical examination, we found that nearly all of these
mice developed osteosarcomas (77%) and/or fibrosarco-
mas (32%). Both tumor types reproducibly displayed loss
of both the Nf2 and p53 wild-type alleles (6/6 tested by
Southern blot analysis; Fig. 3D,E). We also examined the
status of a polymorphic marker between the Nf2 and p53
loci (D11MIT20; Fig. 3A); 2/2 of the germ-line/tumor
DNA pairs that were informative for the D11MIT20
polymorphism showed loss of the C57BL/6 allele and
retention of the 129/Sv-derived allele in the tumor.

(pg) pseudogene]. Residual wild-type signals present in the tumor samples are likely the result of contaminating normal tissue. The
intensities of residual wild-type p53 vs. wild-type Nf2 signals appear unequal here; however, most tumors exhibit equivalent levels of
contaminating tissue. (E) Frequency of metastasis associated with Nf2-deficient or Nf2 plus p53-deficient osteosarcoma or fibrosar-
coma.

Taken together, these results suggest that loss of the
entire wild-type chromosome 11 occurs frequently dur-
ing the etiology of these tumors. Interestingly, although
mice that developed fibrosarcomas usually developed
one to two individual tumors, we often identified as

many as 10 osteosarcoma lesions in each Nf2 +/−;p53
+/− cis mouse, reflecting either metastatic spread of
an individual primary tumor through the bone or mul-
tiple independent tumors. Most of these osteosarcomas
arose within the spinal column or the craniofacial bones,

as in Nf2 heterozygotes; however, the predominant site
of osteosarcoma formation in Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis mice
was within the thin bones lining the nasal passages, a
site rarely affected in Nf2 heterozygous mice. These tu-
mors reached only a very small size before they blocked
the airways completely. The rate of metastasis associ-
ated with these tumors was also high (~40% overall),
although not as high as that observed in Nf2 heterozy-
gotes alone, probably because of the large number of
small individual tumors per mouse and their frequent
localization to the nasal passages, leading to rapid mor-
tality.

Unexpectedly, mice carrying Nf2 and p53 mutations
in trans also showed a significant decrease in survival
(Fig. 3C). Given the genotype of tumors arising in Nf2
+/−;p53 +/− cis mice, we had expected these mice to
exhibit the same tumor spectra and survival rate as that
of Nf2 or p53 heterozygous mice alone, and to detect loss
of either the wild-type Nf2 or p53 allele but not both in
their tumors. Instead, we found that Nf2 +/−;p53 +/−
trans mice predominantly developed osteosarcomas
(74%) or fibrosarcomas (8%) between the ages of 4 and 21
months (mean, 13.3 months; Fig. 3C). Importantly, when
we investigated the status of the Nf2 and p53 loci in
tumors in these mice, we found that most of them had
lost both the Nf2 and p53 wild-type alleles (6/9 analyzed
by Southern blotting). A number of mechanisms could
have led to this outcome: (1) somatic recombination,
placing the mutations in cis, followed by loss of the
other chromosome 11; (2) small deletions involving the
Nf2 and p53 loci separately; or (3) gene conversion, re-
sulting from recombination that occurs distal to p53 or
proximal to Nf2. In each scenario, two events are re-
quired to inactivate both tumor suppressor genes, in con-
trast to the single event required in Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis
mice, or three events required in Nf2 or p53 singly het-
erozygous animals. Two Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans mice de-
veloped tumors exhibiting loss of the wild-type p53 al-
lele and loss of the mutant Nf2 allele, again implying
loss of an entire chromosome and suggesting normal ex-
pression of merlin in these tumors. Importantly, these
mice developed a fibrosarcoma and an osteosarcoma, re-
spectively, neither of which metastasized, whereas
100% (6/6) of the Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans tumors exhib-
iting loss of both wild-type alleles did metastasize.

By crossing Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis mice to p53 −/− mice,
which are prone to developing thymic lymphoma, we
also generated 14 Nf2 +/−;p53 −/− mice. We found that
the survival of these mice was very similar to that of Nf2
+/−;p53 +/− cis animals. Nf2 +/−;p53 −/− mice developed
predominantly osteosarcomas, which exhibited Nf2
LOH, and thymic lymphomas, which did not (data not
shown).

Experimental investigation of metastasis

To address the role of Nf2 mutation in metastasis more
directly, we examined the capacity of tumor cell lines
derived from Nf2-deficient tumors to metastasize with
injection into the tail vein of a syngeneic recipient. We

Nf2 loss in mouse tumorigenesis and metastasis

used osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma cell lines derived
from p53-deficient tumors as controls for the Nf2-defi-
cient tumor cell lines. High levels of merlin expression
were detected in these cell lines by Western blot analysis
(data not shown). We were unable to reexpress merlin
stably in Nf2-deficient tumor cells despite several at-
tempts, suggesting that high levels of Nf2 expression
lead to either growth arrest or cell death. Successful re-
introduction of the expression of other tumor suppressor
genes has met with the same difficulty, probably reflect-
ing the inherent growth suppressive function of their
products. We injected 1–2 million tumor cells of either
genotype into the tail vein of syngeneic C57BL/
6 × 129Sv F1 recipient animals and monitored the mice
for up to 3 weeks postinjection (in three cases nude mice
were used with similar results; Table 2). Although the
Nf2- and p53-deficient tumor cells were derived from
primary tumors of comparable anatomical location and
histological appearance (Fig. 4), their ability to colonize
the lungs of recipient animals in experimental metasta-
sis assays were quite different (Table 2). All of the mice
injected with three different Nf2-deficient fibrosarcoma
cell lines became moribund and were sacrificed by or
before 3.5 weeks, whereas animals injected with nearly
all (3/4) of the p53-deficient fibrosarcoma cell lines sur-
vived and appeared to be healthy 3.5 weeks postinjec-
tion. Upon dissection, we found that all three Nf2-defi-
cient fibrosarcoma cell lines reproducibly formed hun-
dreds of metastases covering the lungs of syngeneic
recipients. Histologically, these metastases had invaded
the lung tissue from all vascular regions (Fig. 4A,B). Im-
portantly, we chose to use two fibrosarcoma cell lines for
which metastasis from the primary tumor was not de-
tected (NfFB1 and NfFB3; Table 2). In contrast, 2/4 of the
p53-deficient fibrosarcoma cell lines did not metastasize
at all. One cell line produced some metastases that ap-
peared histologically as round nests of cells that had not
appreciably invaded the surrounding tissue (not shown).
Only 1/4 of the p53-deficient fibrosarcoma cell lines
tested metastasized to the same extent as the Nf2-defi-
cient cells. In fact, these cells were derived from the
most pleiomorphic and vascularized tumor used in this
study (not shown).

None of the mice injected with osteosarcoma cells,
either Nf2 deficient or control, were moribund at 3
weeks. However, upon dissection, we found that both of
the Nf2-deficient osteosarcoma cell lines did metasta-
size, whereas the two p53-deficient cell lines that we
tested did not (Table 2). (We observed one tiny pocket of
abnormal cells in the lung of one animal; however, it was
not possible to tell whether they were tumor cells be-
cause there were so few). The metastases derived from
Nf2-deficient osteosarcoma cells were often highly dif-
ferentiated, similar to the endogenously arising metasta-
ses in Nf2 heterozygous mutant animals (not shown).
Together, we found that 100% of the Nf2-deficient tu-
mor cell lines tested were capable of surviving in the
bloodstream and colonizing a secondary site, whereas
most Nf2-expressing tumor cell lines were not. This be-
havior is not simply attributable to differences in the

cThe animal was moribund and was sacrificed before the endpoint of the experiment, apparently because of a large metastatic load.
dShortly after injection of the tumor cells, we discovered that this mouse was pregnant; pups were delivered 2 weeks postinjection.
Pregnancy may have had a positive effect on the growth of tumor cells in this mouse.

growth properties of these cells, as their growth rates in
vitro did not differ dramatically. In addition, two fibro-
sarcoma lines, Nf2FB1 and p53FB3, formed tumors at
equivalent and rapid rates when injected subcutaneously
into nude mice; the tumors did not metastasize in these
animals, apparently because of the very rapid increase in
tumor volume. These results provide direct support for a
role for the loss of merlin function in metastatic poten-
tial.

Discussion

In contrast to the limited spectrum of benign tumors
associated with NF2 in humans, mice that are the ge-
netic analogs of human NF2 patients develop a variety of
malignant tumor types and do not model human NF2.
Human NF2 patients do not develop osteosarcomas, fi-
brosarcomas, or hepatocellular carcinomas
(Huson
1994). Whether mutations at the NF2 locus are involved
in the development of these tumor types or the meta-
static transition of any tumor type in humans is cur-
rently unknown. Both the spectrum and the aggressive
nature of the tumors associated with Nf2 loss in the
mouse is surprising, as is the high rate of metastasis
observed in association with Nf2-deficient tumors. Al-
though the reason for the strikingly different phenotype

1128

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

in the mouse is not clear, information from several other
systems has provided some insight. For example, consid-
erable evidence suggests that members of the retinoblas-
toma (Rb) family of proteins can compensate for the loss
of one another in certain contexts in vivo (Lee et al. 1996;
Hurford et al. 1997). It is possible that the closely related
ERM proteins can compensate similarly for merlin loss
in mouse Schwann cells or the human osteoblast lin-
eage. Indeed, we have determined that there is consider-
able overlap in the mRNA expression patterns of the
ERMs and Nf2 in the developing mouse embryo (Mc-
Clatchey et al. 1997; unpubl.). Moreover, the partial se-
quences of two Nf2-related transcripts from mouse have
been reported (Takeshima et al. 1994). Alternatively,
there may be marked species-specific differences in the
rate of loss of the wild-type allele in different cell types
(i.e., Schwann cells vs. osteoblasts). Mounting evidence
suggests that this may account at least partially for phe-
notypic differences between mice and humans carrying
mutations in the NF1 gene (S. Shih and T. Jacks, un-
publ.). Finally, it is conceivable that synteny differences
between the mouse and human genomes may contribute
to phenotypic differences, espcially considering the ap-
parently frequent loss of an entire chromosome during
mouse tumorigenesis. For example, a growth factor,
growth factor receptor, or compensating family member

Nf2 loss in mouse tumorigenesis and metastasis

Although osteosarcomas are rare in wild-type mice,
they are commonly induced by radiation, viruses, or vi-
ral oncoproteins (for review, see Michiels and Merregaert
1993). Thus, polyomavirus (Py), the Py early region, sim-
ian virus SV40, the SV40 large T-antigen, the Finkel–
Biskis–Jinkins (FBJ) and Finkel–Biskis–Reilly (FBR) retro-
viruses, the FBJ-encoded oncoprotein v-fos or its cellular
homolog c-fos can all induce the formation of osteosar-
comas in mice upon infection or when expressed trans-
genically (Py and SV40 can also induce the formation of
fibrosarcomas). When reported, only a small percentage
of the osteosarcomas in these mice were found to me-
tastasize (0%–33%; Finkel et al. 1966; Ruther et al. 1989;
Knowles et al. 1990; Wilkie et al. 1994). Finally, as dis-
cussed earlier, p53 heterozygous mutant mice develop
osteosarcomas and fibrosarcomas that metastasize at
low frequency (Taverna et al. 1998; A.I. McClatchey and
T. Jacks, unpubl.). Hepatocellular carcinoma is also rare
in wild-type mice (Bronson 1990); mouse models of he-
patocellular carcinoma have been generated historically
by administration of chemical carcinogens (i.e., ethylni-
trosourea, benzo(a)pyrene, etc.; Vesselinovitch et al.
1978).

We observed marked cooperativity between a Nf2 mu-
tation and a heterozygous mutation at the p53 locus,
which resides on the same mouse chromosome, in the
development of a subset of the tumor types that either of
the singly heterozygous mutant strains develop. By ma-
nipulating the configuration of the two mutations with
respect to the two chromosomes 11, we were able to
investigate the effects of mutational linkage upon tu-
morigenesis. The result is illustrated most dramatically
by the phenotype of Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− mice that carry the
mutations in cis on the same chromosome 11. These
mice survive only to the age of 5 months, developing
multiple tumors that show loss of both the Nf2 and p53
wild-type alleles, and LOH at a locus between the two.
Furthermore, we noted a surprisingly reduced survival of
Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans mice compared to Nf2 or p53 sin-
gly heterozygous mice and observed the loss of both Nf2
and p53 wild-type alleles in those tumors. The frequent
loss of an entire chromosome during mouse tumorigen-
esis has been described previously (Luongo et al. 1994).
Although our results appear to provide dramatic support
for this, we cannot rule out the possibility that large
interstitial deletions occur, leaving a small fragment of
the distal end of chromosome 11 fused to the telocentric
centromere behind. These results also illustrate the
strong selection for loss of both Nf2 and p53 function in
the development of osteosarcomas and fibrosarcomas.
Whether this reflects a functional relationship between
the two proteins or the fact that loss of Nf2 function in
the osteoblast lineage normally leads to p53-dependent
apoptosis, is unclear.

Our results suggest a role for Nf2 mutation in meta-
static potential in the mouse. We have observed a greatly
elevated frequency of metastasis associated with tumors
that have lost Nf2 function, with or without concomi-
tant loss of p53 function. In fact, the anatomical loca-
tions and histological profiles of many of these tumors

might be linked to Nf2 in one species and not in another;
therefore, its expression during tumorigenesis might be
affected differentially.

We identified three tumor types that arose frequently
in Nf2 heterozygous mice and exhibited loss of the wild
type Nf2 allele—osteosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and he-
patocellular carcinomas. We also identified other tumor
types that arose at a low frequency in Nf2 heterozygotes
and did not appear in our wild-type controls. For ex-
ample, several chondrosarcomas and uterine sarcomas
developed in Nf2 +/− mice and in some cases loss of the
wild-type Nf2 allele was detected. In addition, several
Nf2 +/− animals developed bile duct carcinomas, which
were never seen in wild-type animals; however, we did
not obtain enough tissue from these lesions for analysis
of the status of the Nf2 allele. Together, these observa-
tions suggest that Nf2 loss can contribute to the forma-
tion of a broad spectrum of tumor types in the mouse.

are identical to those that arise in p53 singly heterozy-
gous mice and metastasize at a much lower frequency.
Although the observed cooperation between Nf2 and p53
loss in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma formation sup-
ports a common cellular origin for these tumors, it is
possible that the particular cell type affected by Nf2 mu-
tation is fundamentally different and may be particularly
metastatically competent. Alternatively, it is possible
that the increased rate of metastasis in Nf2 +/− mice
reflects their advanced age. In this light it is important to
note that we saw no bias in the frequency of metastasis
occurring in younger (10–19 months) versus older (20+
months) Nf2 +/− animals (data not shown). Moreover,
tumors occurring in Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans mice that lose
heterozygosity at both the Nf2 and p53 loci also exhib-
ited a high rate of metastasis, yet their average age of
death is younger than that of p53 singly heterozygous
animals whose tumors metastasized infrequently (Fig.
3C). The lower frequency of metastasis identified in
young (3- to 5-month-old) Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis animals
most likely reflects the rapid lethality associated with a
large number of primary tumors in each animal and their
frequent localization to the nasal passages. In an effort to
begin to address the role of merlin loss in metastatic
potential directly, we characterized the properties of
Nf2- and p53-deficient osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma
cells in an experimental metastasis assay. We found Nf2-
deficient tumor cells to be much more proficient in colo-
nizing the lungs of syngeneic recipent animals than their
p53-deficient counterparts, strongly supporting a role for
merlin loss in promoting metastatic potential.

The mechanism by which loss of merlin function con-
tributes to tumor formation could in fact be related to a
role for its loss in promoting metastasis. The physical
location of merlin at the membrane/cytoskeletal inter-
face suggests that merlin is somehow involved in the
integration of extracellular signals with those involved
in reorganizing the cytoskeleton and controlling cell
cycle entry. Upon loss of adhesion, fibroblasts undergo
reversible growth arrest, whereas epithelial or endothe-
lial cells undergo apoptosis (or anoikis; for review, see
Frisch and Ruoslahti 1997). This regulatory system prob-
ably underlies the phenomenon of anchorage depen-
dence for normal cell growth and its failure leads to the
anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells. We have
determined that merlin protein levels are up-regulated
upon certain growth arrest stimuli including loss of ad-
hesion, confluence, or serum deprivation, suggesting
that merlin may normally participate in the receipt of or
response to such growth arrest cues (Shaw et al. 1998).
Perhaps in the absence of merlin function, such cues are
misinterpreted or not received, resulting in inappropriate
cell-cycle entry and continued proliferation. Successful
metastasis further requires migration of tumor cells
through blood vessel walls (intravasation), anchorage-in-
dependent survival in the circulation, exit from the
blood vessels (extravasation), and survival and invasion
of a secondary tissue where the extracellular microenvi-
ronment will be foreign (i.e., lung or liver). Nf2-deficient
tumor cells may fail to properly receive growth arrest

1130

signals in suspension as they travel through the blood-
stream, or misinterpret growth factor signals in the lung
or liver microenvironment as survival signals. The un-
usually differentiated nature of many of the osteosar-
coma metastases in Nf2 +/− mice suggests that Nf2-de-
ficient tumor cells may actually interpret signals in the
lung or liver as differentiation signals. Alternatively, this
may reflect the survival of Nf2-deficient tumor cells in a
foreign microenvironment prior to sustaining the full
repertoire of genetic mutations that normally accompa-
nies full transformation. It has been suggested that the
rate-limiting step in a successful metastatic event is sur-
vival and invasion of a distant site; tumor cells that are
able to survive in the bloodstream are often unable to
colonize a secondary tissue (for review, see Chambers et
al. 1995). We characterized a number of low passage Nf2-
deficient tumor cell lines in an experimental metastasis
assay and found that 100% of them are capable of colo-
nizing the lungs of recipient animals. Moreover, most
Nf2-expressing tumor cell lines derived from histologi-
cally matched p53-deficient tumors were unable to colo-
nize the lungs of recipient animals. The inability to sta-
bly reintroduce Nf2 expression into the tumor cells and
the early lethality of Nf2 homozygous mutant embryos
makes it difficult to investigate directly merlin’s role in
these processes. However, the continued characteriza-
tion of the behavior of these cells and ultimately of pri-
mary Nf2-deficient cells both in vitro and in vivo will be
invaluable in addressing these issues.

The strong similarity between merlin and the ERM
proteins suggests that these proteins function analo-
gously. However, in contrast to the growth and motility-
suppressing function of merlin revealed by the tumori-
genic and invasive consequences of its loss, several lines
of evidence suggest that ERM proteins promote cell pro-
liferation and motility. First, ERM function has been
linked recently to the signaling network of the Rho fam-
ily of small GTPases that promote cytoskeletal reorga-
nization, cell growth, and cell motility (for review, see
Van Aelst and D’Souza-Schorey 1997). Tiam-1, a positive
regulator of the Rho family member Rac was identified
originally as an invasion-promoting protein implicated
in metastasis (Habets et al. 1994). Rho promotes the in-
teraction between the ERM proteins and CD44, which
has itself been shown to play an important role in inva-
sion and metastasis (for review, see Kincade et al. 1997).
The ERM proteins can also bind to and apparently inac-
tivate RhoGDI, a negative regulator of Rho GTPases that
also inhibits the motility of fibroblasts (Takahashi et al.
1997). Moreover, it has been demonstrated recently that
activation of the Rho pathway leads to phosphorylation
of ERM proteins in vivo, perhaps through the Rho effec-
tor Rho kinase, which can phosphorylate the carboxyl
terminus of radixin in vitro (Matsui et al. 1998). Second,
ezrin can be phosphorylated directly by HGF/scatter fac-
tor; ezrin is apparently both necessary and sufficient for
HGF/scatter factor-induced epithelial cell migration
(Crepaldi et al. 1997). Finally, fos, which induces osteo-
sarcomas in mice, also induces the expression, phos-
phorylation, and relocalization of ezrin (Lamb et al.

Downloaded from

1997b). fos-transformed fibroblasts exhibit increased in-
vasiveness in vitro, contingent on fos-induced expres-
sion and relocalization of the ERM membrane partner
CD44 (Lamb et al. 1997a). Up-regulation of ezrin has also
been correlated with the increased proliferation and im-
mortalization of fibroblasts in vitro (Kaul et al. 199). To-
gether, these studies indicate a positive role for the ERM
proteins, especially ezrin, in cell growth and motility.
Therefore, an intriguing possibility is that merlin may
function to regulate or antagonize the function of the
other ERM proteins; removal of merlin could constitu-
tively activate these pathways. Merlin is the most dis-
tantly related ERM family member and does not contain
the carboxy-terminal actin-binding domain present in
the ERM proteins. In addition, it is interesting to note
that recent evidence suggests that the overexpression of
merlin alters the subcellular localization of ezrin in
some circumstances (Sainio et al. 1997).

In summary, these studies reveal profound conse-
quences for loss of merlin function in mouse tumorigen-
esis and suggest a much broader role for merlin and per-
haps the other ERM proteins in the development and
progression of cancer. We have generated a manipulat-
able system and a set of tools that can be used to further
investigate merlin function and the role of the cytoskel-
eton more generally in tumorigenesis and metastasis.
Importantly, this system can also be used to study the
metastatic process and potentially to identify other
genes whose function may be perturbed during metasta-
sis.

Materials and methods

Generation and genotyping of Nf2 heterozygous mice

The generation of Nf2 +/− ES cell clones derived from D3 ES
cells of the 129Sv/Pas substrain has been described (Mc-
Clatchey et al. 1997). Three different 129/SvPas Nf2 +/− ES cell
clones were used to generate 21 chimeric animals by injection
into wild-type C57BL/6 blastocyst stage embryos. Chimeric
animals were bred to either wild-type C57BL/6 or 129Sv/Jae
animals to produce 99 Nf2 +/− F1, 23 wild-type F1, and 37 129Sv
Nf2 +/− animals. The 129Sv/Pas and 129Sv/Jae substrains are
nearly identical (Simpson et al. 1997); lineages resulting from
the breeding of chimeras and 129Sv/Jae mice are hereafter re-
ferred to as 129Sv. In addition, 45 F2 animals were generated by
intercrossing of F1 heterozygotes. Tail DNA was isolated and
genotyped using a cocktail of primers: a (5⬘-GGGGCTTCGG-
GAAACCTGG-3⬘), b (5⬘-GTCTGGGAAGTCTGTGGAGG-3⬘),
and c (5⬘-CTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGG-3⬘) (McClatchey et
al. 1997). Primer pair a-b amplifies a 306-bp product from the
wild-type allele, whereas primer pair a-c amplifies a 575-bp
product from the mutant allele.

Generation and genotyping of Nf2 and p53 mutant mice

Nf2 and p53 heterozygous mice were intercrossed, producing
Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− trans mice, which were then mated to wild-
type animals to produce Nf2 +/−;p53 +/− cis animals. Detection
of the p53 mutant allele was performed by PCR analysis as
described (Jacks et al. 1994).

Nf2 loss in mouse tumorigenesis and metastasis

Analysis of Nf2 and p53 loss of heterozygosity

Nf2 and p53 LOH analysis was evaluated by Southern blotting.
Tumor DNA was isolated and extracted once with phenol/chlo-
roform (1:1) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1)
and precipitated with ethanol. Nf2 LOH analysis was performed
by Southern blotting of StuI-digested DNA and hybridization to
a 233-bp genomic Nf2 probe (McClatchey et al. 1997). Similarly,
p53 LOH analysis was performed by Southern blotting of StuI–
EcoRI-digested DNA and hybridization to a probe correspond-
ing to exons 7–10 of the p53 cDNA (Jacks et al. 1994).

For allelotyping, simple sequence length polymorphism
(SSLP) marker D11MIT20 (Research Genetics) was chosen be-
cause of its location approximately midway between the Nf2
and p53 loci, and because it is informative with respect to the
C57BL/6 and 129/Sv strains (Y. Chen and T. Jacks, unpubl.).
Primers a and b detect a 116-bp band specific to C57BL/6 DNA
and a ~150-bp band specific to 129/Sv DNA by PCR.

Necropsy and histology

Animals were sacrificed upon decline in the health of the ani-
mal (i.e., weight loss, paralysis, ruffling of fur, or inactivity) or
obvious tumor burden. A full autopsy was performed and tis-
sues were fixed in either Bouin’s fixative (bone) or 10% neutral-
buffered formalin (non-bone), dehydrated, and paraffin imbed-
ded. Sections (4 µm) were generated and stained with hematoxy-
lin and eosin. For detection of metastases, a single section
through the spleen, each kidney, or each lobe of the lung was
examined. The liver was cut into several pieces to fit easily in
standard tissue-processing cassettes; therefore, approximately
two to three sections through each lobe was examined.

Derivation of tumor cell lines

A small piece of tumor was rinsed in PBS, minced in trypsin/
EDTA for 15–30 min, followed by further dissociation and plat-
ing in DMEM plus 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies).
Tumor cells were passaged twice and frozen at 2 × 106 cells/
vial; in general, one vial was thawed and passaged 0–1 time
before tail vein injection (see below).

Tail vein injections/metastasis assays

P3-P6 tumor cells (1 × 106 to 2 × 106) were resuspended in 200 µl
of PBS and injected into the tail vein of syngeneic F1 C57BL/6:
129Sv animals using a 27-gauge needle. The animals were moni-
tored and sacrificed when moribund or upon the sacrifice of
matched animals injected simultaneously with p53-deficient
tumor cells (2–4 weeks; see Table 2).
