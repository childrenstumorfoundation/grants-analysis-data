SUMMARY

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann cell (SC)-lineage-
derived sarcomas. Molecular events driving SC-to-MPNST transformation are incompletely understood.
Here, we show that human MPNSTs exhibit elevated HIPPO-TAZ/YAP expression, and that TAZ/YAP
hyperactivity in SCs caused by Lats1/2 loss potently induces high-grade nerve-associated tumors with full
penetrance. Lats1/2 deﬁciency reprograms SCs to a cancerous, progenitor-like phenotype and promotes
hyperproliferation. Conversely, disruption of TAZ/YAP activity alleviates tumor burden in Lats1/2-deﬁcient
mice and inhibits human MPNST cell proliferation. Moreover, genome-wide proﬁling reveals that TAZ/
YAP-TEAD1 directly activates oncogenic programs,
including platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) signaling. Co-targeting TAZ/YAP and PDGFR pathways inhibits tumor growth. Thus, our ﬁndings
establish a previously unrecognized convergence between Lats1/2-TAZ/YAP signaling and MPNST patho-
genesis, revealing potential therapeutic targets in these untreatable tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly
aggressive nerve-associated sarcomas with strong metastatic

proclivity and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy (Farid
et al., 2014; Stemmer-Rachamimov et al., 2004) that account
for the leading cause of death in adult neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 (NF1) patients. MPNSTs either occur independently or in

Signiﬁcance

MPNSTs are one of the most aggressive soft tissue sarcomas with poor prognosis. Here, we uncover TAZ/YAP hyperacti-
vation caused by Lats1/2-deﬁciency as a convergent mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of MPNSTs. Lats1/2-deﬁ-
cient mice developed peripheral nerve sheath tumors with full penetrance, which resemble clinically relevant genetic le-
sions, anatomical locations, and the developmental cell of origin in the human disease. Our data further identify a set of
dysregulated tumorigenic pathways targeted by the TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 axis and demonstrate the efﬁcacy of co-inhibition
of TAZ/YAP and PDGFR pathways in suppression of tumor growth. These ﬁndings suggest hyperactivation of TAZ/YAP
as an oncogenic signaling hub that promotes SC transformation and identify a HIPPO-PDGF dependent pathway for MPNST
pathogenesis and potential therapeutic intervention.

association with the NF1 mutation (Farid et al., 2014). NF1 deﬁ-
ciency by itself is insufﬁcient to induce MPNST. MPNST ge-
nomes variably show additional genetic aberrations, including
the ampliﬁcation of PDGFRA, EGFR, or MET and the loss of
CDKN2A, RB, TP53, or the PRC2 components, SUZ12 or EED
(Carroll, 2016). At present, the totality of genetic alterations
and pathways responsible for NF1-asssociated and sporadic
MPNST formation remains enigmatic.

(SC)

It is generally accepted that MPNSTs derive from the Schwann
cell
lineage. Activation of several signaling pathways,
including RAS/RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
in SCs, contribute to MPNST growth. Inhibition of these path-
ways, however, blocks MPNST progression only to a limited
extent (Farid et al., 2014). Though clinically useful biomarkers
were identiﬁed in genetic screens (Hummel et al., 2010; Rahr-
mann et al., 2013), targetable pathways are still much needed
in MPNSTs. The signaling mechanisms underpinning MPNST
initiation and progression remain poorly understood.

A signaling pathway, HIPPO-YAP/TAZ signaling, has emerged
as a central player in organ growth control and tumorigenesis
(Harvey et al., 2013; Zanconato et al., 2016). The HIPPO
signaling components Lats1 and Lats2, each encodes a tumor
suppressive serine/threonine-protein kinase, phosphorylate
their effectors TAZ/YAP, and thereby inhibit TAZ/YAP activity
by preventing their translocation to the nucleus (Varelas, 2014).
Nuclear TAZ and YAP interact with transcriptional partners, pre-
dominantly TEAD transcription factors, to regulate cell growth
and maintain cellular homeostasis (Varelas, 2014). Sustained
TAZ/YAP activation endows differentiated adult cells with an
array of oncogenic hallmarks, including hyperproliferation, che-
moresistance, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-related traits
(Harvey et al., 2013; Zanconato et al., 2016).

Recent whole-exome sequencing of peripheral nerve tumors
identiﬁed a nonsense mutation in LATS1 (Kim et al., 2014). In
addition, loss of a copy of either LATS1 or LATS2, or their pro-
moter hypermethylation, was detected in patients with periph-
eral nerve sheath tumors (Kim et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2015).
Furthermore, whole-genome copy number variation analysis of
a cohort of MPNST tissues indicated 25% of patient samples
as exhibiting copy number changes in HIPPO component genes
(e.g., LATS2, TAZ, BIRC5, and CTGF) (Yang et al., 2011). Given
that LATS1 and LATS2 mutations exist in human peripheral
nerve tumors, here we sought to understand whether aberrant
activation of the HIPPO effectors TAZ/YAP contributes to malig-
nant transformation in peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

RESULTS

Elevation of HIPPO-TAZ/YAP Signature Gene
Expression in Human MPNSTs
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of publicly available
expression data from two MPNST patient cohorts, Jessen_
cohort (GEO: GSE41747) and Kolberg_cohort (GEO: GSE66743)
(Jessen et al., 2013; Kolberg et al., 2015), revealed a YAP-
conserved signature (Cordenonsi et al., 2011) as one of the top
signiﬁcantly enriched oncogenic gene sets in Molecular Signa-
tures Database (MSigDB) (Subramanian et al., 2005) in MPNSTs,
compared with normal nerves or NF1-neuroﬁbromas (a precursor
lesion for MPNST) (Figures 1A–1C, S1A, and S1B). Moreover,

GSEA identiﬁed a strong enrichment of YAP-activated signature
(Tremblay et al., 2014) in MPNSTs from both cohorts (Figures
S1C–S1E), suggestive of HIPPO-TAZ/YAP hyperactivity in
MPNSTs. This was conﬁrmed by the elevation of YAP-conserved
and YAP-activated signature expression in MPNSTs relative to
normal nerves or neuroﬁbromas (Figures 1D–1F). Notably, neither
the YAP-conserved signature nor the YAP-activated signature
was altered in expression in neuroﬁbromas when compared
with normal nerves (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1F). Activation of the
HIPPO-TAZ/YAP pathway was detected in both NF1- and non-
NF1-associated sporadic MPNSTs (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1F),
which exhibit similar YAP signature enrichment, suggesting that
TAZ/YAP hyperactivity may act as a convergence point for
MPNST pathogenesis regardless of the NF1 status.

Consistently, we detected signiﬁcantly reduced LATS1 and
LATS2 expression in MPNST, compared with neuroﬁbroma (Fig-
ure 1G). Furthermore, array CGH analysis from 51 MPNST sam-
ples (Yang et al., 2011) revealed an increase in the copy number
of HIPPO effector gene loci, including TAZ, CTGF, and BIRC5,
and a loss of HIPPO inhibitory gene loci, such as LATS2 and
AMOTL2 (Figure S1G).

In addition, we detected abundant nuclear TAZ and YAP
expression in MPNST specimens, which displayed signiﬁcantly
higher proportions of TAZ+ and YAP+ cells than benign neuroﬁ-
bromas or normal nerves (Figures 1H–1J), suggesting an eleva-
tion in YAP/TAZ expression selectively in MPNSTs, but not
neuroﬁbromas. Immunolabeling further revealed robust TAZ/
YAP expression in Sox10+ SCs distinctively in human MPNST
versus neuroﬁbromas (Figures 1K and 1L), as well as in human
SC-derived MPNST cell lines, SNF96.2 and SNF02.2 (Figure 1M),
suggesting a cell-intrinsic expression of TAZ/YAP in MPNST
tumor cells.

Lats1/2 Ablation in the Schwann Cell Lineage Leads to
Peripheral Nerve Sheath Malignancies
To investigate the consequences of activation of both TAZ
and YAP in SCs, the primary cell type of origin for MPNST, we
ablated Lats1/2 by breeding Lats1ﬂ/ﬂLats2ﬂ/ﬂ mice (Heallen
et al., 2011) with an SC lineage-expressing desert hedgehog
promoter-driven Dhh-Cre (Jaegle et al., 2003). The Lats1/2-deﬁ-
cient mice carrying three copies of Lats1/2 deletion alleles
(Lats1ﬂ/ﬂLats2ﬂ/+:Dhh-Cre [Lats1 knockout
(KO)], or Lats1ﬂ/+
Lats2ﬂ/ﬂ:Dhh-Cre [Lats2 KO], collectively deﬁned as Lats1/
2-deﬁcient mice) developed nerve-associated tumors with
100% penetrance.

Tumors arose in the dermis, spinal nerve roots, and peripheral
nerves, including the sciatic nerves (SNs). Pathological classiﬁ-
cation revealed that whereas tumors were all PNST, those in
the dermis were largely low-grade (grade I PNST) (Figure 2A),
but did not precisely resemble benign human neuroﬁbroma or
schwannoma due to their highly cellular and invasive features.
Tumors from paraspinal regions, including nerve roots or dorsal
root ganglia, and peripheral nerves were classiﬁed as aggres-
sive, rapidly growing high-grade (grade III) genetically engi-
neered mouse (GEM)-PNSTs (Figures 2B–2E, S2A, and S2B),
resembling MPNSTs in humans (Stemmer-Rachamimov et al.,
2004). The high-grade PNSTs consisted of densely packed cells
with high cellularity entrapping muscle ﬁbers, indicating strong
invasiveness of tumor cells (Figures 2B and 2E). Some cells

displayed enlarged nuclei and/or heterologous epithelioid differ-
entiation, a feature of MPNST. Thus, the grade III GEM-PNSTs
developed in anatomical
locations corresponding to those
observed in human MPNSTs. The maximum lifespan of Lats1/
2-deﬁcient mice was 4–5 months of age (Figures 2F and 2G).

Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumors that robustly expressed TAZ and
YAP consisted primarily of Sox10+ SC lineage cells and were
highly proliferative (Figures 2H and 2I). Consistently, Lats1 or
Lats2 KO nerves exhibited augmented levels of TAZ, YAP, and
their DNA-binding co-factor partners, such as TEAD1 (Figure 2J),
and their downstream targets Ctgf, Cyr61, and Ccnd1 (Fig-
ure S2C). These data indicate that Lats1/2 deﬁciency activates
TAZ/YAP expression and hyperproliferation in SCs.

Although SC proliferation, differentiation, and myelination in
mutant mice proceeded normally in the ﬁrst postnatal week at
P7 (Figures S2D and S2E), there was an increase in proliferative
SCs in Lats-deﬁcient SNs at P21 compared with control (Figures
2K and 2L). Mutant animals started to develop palpable tumors
around 3 weeks of age. Tumors in Lats1/2-deﬁcient SNs also ex-
hibited characteristics of grade III GEM-PNST with hyperplasia
alongside a widespread ampliﬁcation of atypical and large nuclei
(Figure 2M).

We evaluated SC differentiation in Lats1/2-deﬁcient SNs by
co-labeling for the mature SC marker MBP (myelin basic protein)
and Sox10. Mutant SNs exhibited substantially reduced MBP+
area, increased a-SMA (ﬁbroblast antigen), and were populated
by a massive expansion of Sox10+ SCs (Figures S3A and S3B).
Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy detected myelin
sheath loss in the adult Lats1/2-deﬁcient nerves, with a notable
increase in extracellular matrix deposition (Figure S3C). More-
over, non-myelinated axons became dissociated from Remak
bundles in Lats1/2-deﬁcient nerves (Figure S3D), consistent
with nerve sheath tumor pathogenesis observed in other mouse
models (Wu et al., 2008).

In contrast to the Lats1/2-deﬁcient mice, no tumors were de-
tected in adult mice carrying single Lats1 or Lats2 gene deletion
(Lats1ﬂ/ﬂ:Dhh-Cre or Lats2ﬂ/ﬂ:Dhh-Cre) (Figure S3E), while dou-
ble Lats1 and Lats2-null mice (Lats1ﬂ/ﬂLats2ﬂ/ﬂ:Dhh-Cre) were
embryonically lethal, suggesting a dosage-dependent effect on
tumor formation. This is consistent with functional redundancy
of Lats1 and Lats2 in the HIPPO signaling pathway (Visser and
Yang, 2010).

Mature SCs with Lats1/2 Deﬁciency in Adult Mice
Develop Nerve-Associated Tumors
The observation that SC differentiation and myelination at early
postnatal stages appeared normal prompted us to question
whether tumor cells could be derived from differentiated SCs.
To test this, we ablated Lats1/2 in mature SCs by a tamoxifen-
inducible Plp1-CreERT in adult mice (Lats1ﬂ/ﬂLats2ﬂ/+:Plp1-
CreERT; termed Lats1/2-iDeﬁcient; Figure 3A). Following tamox-
ifen induction, Plp1-CreERT speciﬁcally and efﬁciently induced
Tomato reporter expression in Krox20+ mature myelinating
SCs in the adult peripheral nerves carrying a CAG-Tomato
ﬂoxed-STOP allele (Figure 3B).

Strikingly, Lats1/2-iDeﬁcient adult mice developed aggressive
nerve-associated tumors of Sox10+ SC origin after tamoxifen
administration with full penetrance and a shortened lifespan (Fig-
ures 3C and 3D). All Lats1/2-iDeﬁcient mice analyzed developed

296 Cancer Cell 33, 292–308, February 12, 2018

both dermal and paraspinal/nerve GEM-PNST, of low or high
grade, characterized by hypercellularity, high proliferation, and
extensive Sox10 and TAZ/YAP expression (Figures 3E–3H),
suggesting that Lats1/2 deﬁciency in mature differentiated
SCs leads to GEM-PNST formation. Our data indicate that
Lats1/2 loss-mediated dysregulation of HIPPO signaling can
potently cause peripheral nerve malignancy in both immature
and mature SCs.

Schwann Cells with TAZ/YAP Hyperactivation Are Highly
Tumorigenic
To characterize the molecular identity of Lats1/2-deﬁcient SC
cells, we additionally introduced a CAG-CAT-EGFP (ccGFP) re-
porter (Nakamura et al., 2006) into Lats1/2-deﬁcient mice driven
by SC-expressing Dhh-Cre (Lats1/2-deﬁcient; ccGFPﬂ/+). Tumor
cells dissociated from paraspinal nerve-associated tumors from
Lats1/2-deﬁcient; ccGFPﬂ/+ mice were capable of propagating
as an adherent monolayer. Among the GFP+ tumor cells, approx-
imately 55.3% ± 2.8% expressed both Sox10 and the stem cell/
progenitor marker Sox2 (Figures S4A and S4B), indicative of an
undifferentiated immature SC-like phenotype. Notably, a fraction
of GFP+ cells (15.5% ± 5.2%) were Sox2+Sox10–, which might
represent a stem cell-like subpopulation among the Lats1/2-deﬁ-
cient tumor cells (Figure S4B). Further, the majority of GFP+ cells
(81.5% ± 6.4%) expressed nuclear TAZ/YAP, conﬁrming TAZ/
YAP hyperactivation in S100b-expressing SCs when Lats1/2
were ablated (Figure S4C). These tumor cells harbored a mono-
phasic, ﬂattened, and spindle morphology with enlarged nuclei
(Figure S4D), and were highly proliferative (Figure S4E).

Next, we evaluated the tumorigenicity of Lats1/2-deﬁcient
SCs in an allograft model (Figure 3I). Dissociated mutant tumor
cells from an early passage generated tumors in immunodeﬁ-
cient nude mice with 100% penetrance within as short as
7 days (Figures 3I and 3J). These tumors contained predomi-
nantly Sox10+ SCs, expressed TAZ/YAP, and were proliferative
(Figure 3K). They were histologically similar to human MPNST,
showing hypercellularity and invasiveness, permeating into
surrounding muscles (Figure 3K). Serial dilutions of single cell
suspensions transplanting as few as 250 cells into nude mice
propagated the same type of tumors with remarkably short la-
tency (Figure 3I). Primary allograft-derived cells, when serially
transplanted into secondary recipients, also propagated tumors
that resembled aggressive MPNST (Figures 3L and 3M), indi-
cating a highly aggressive nature of SC-derived tumor cells lack-
ing tumor suppressive Lats1/2.

TAZ/YAP Hyperactivation Reprograms Schwann Cells
and Is Required for Tumor Cell Growth
To investigate whether persistent TAZ/YAP hyperactivation was
sufﬁcient to reprogram or transform normal SCs into tumor cells,
we ectopically expressed a phosphomutant TAZ (TAZ4SA) lack-
ing all LATS phosphorylation sites or a YAP (YAPS112A) phospho-
mutant into primary rat SCs (Lei et al., 2008; Xin et al., 2013). En-
forced expression of nuclear TAZ4SA or YAPS112A perceptibly
altered the morphology of the transfected SCs into a ﬂattened
and elaborate shape with enlarged nuclei, which mimicked
Lats1/2-deﬁcient cells (Figure S5A). Moreover, SCs overex-
pressing TAZ4SA or YAPS112A exhibited little if any expression
of SC marker Sox10 (Figures 4A and 4B), and became highly

proliferative (Figures 4A and 4C). Our data suggest that esca-
lated TAZ and YAP activity may de-differentiate and reprogram
normal SCs into to a precursor/stem-like state to promote
tumorigenesis.

To test whether inhibition of TAZ/YAP could impair tumor cell
expansion, we knocked down Taz or Yap1 by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells. Efﬁcient knock-
down of Taz/Yap1 was conﬁrmed by qPCR showing signiﬁcant
downregulation of Taz, Yap1, and their target genes (Figures
4D, S5B, and S5C). Combined TAZ/YAP suppression dramati-
cally reduced proliferation (Figures 4E–4G) and induced
apoptosis, resulting in an overall reduction in cell number over
time (Figures 4H and 4I). In addition, pharmacological inhibition
of TAZ/YAP by verteporﬁn or dobutamine (Bao et al., 2011;
Liu-Chittenden et al., 2012), but not an unrelated control MK-
0752, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, effectively reduced TAZ/
YAP expression and activity, which impeded mutant tumor cell
proliferation and survival (Figures 4J–4M and S5D–S5F).

As HIPPO-YAP/TAZ signatures were strongly upregulated in
human MPNST samples (Figure 1), we then silenced TAZ/YAP
in human MPNST cells, SNF02.2, and SNF96.2 by speciﬁc
siRNA knockdown. We detected a robust reduction in down-
stream target gene expression and attenuation of proliferation
in these MPNST cells (Figures 4N–4Q). Moreover, TAZ/YAP
silencing also resulted in tumor cell death (Figures S5G–S5J).
These results suggest that the activity of the HIPPO effectors
TAZ/YAP is critical for sustained growth of Lats1/2-deﬁcient
GEM-PNST cells and human MPNST cells.

Taz/Yap1 Reduction Effectively Inhibits Tumor
Progression in Lats1/2-Deﬁcient Nerves
To determine whether inhibition of TAZ/YAP hyperactivity in SCs
could rescue the in vivo tumor phenotype in Lats1/2-deﬁcient
mice, we genetically ablated Taz/Yap1 together with Lats1/2
in the Dhh+ SC lineage. Owing, however, to the requirement
of Taz/Yap1 for normal SC development (Deng et al., 2017;
Grove et al., 2017; Poitelon et al., 2016), concurrent loss of Tazﬂ/ﬂ
Yap1ﬂ/ﬂ or Tazﬂ/ﬂ;Yap1ﬂ/+ alleles in Lats1/2-deﬁcient SCs resulted
in a severe peripheral neuropathy and perinatal
lethality.
We therefore focused our analysis on Lats1/2-deﬁcient
mice with Taz/Yap1 haploinsufﬁciency, namely Lats1/2-def;
Tazﬂ/+;Yap1ﬂ/+;Dhh-Cre and Lats1/2-def;Tazﬂ/+;Yap1ﬂ/ﬂ;Dhh-Cre
(henceforth Lats1/2-def-TazLo/LoYap1Lo/Lo), which all survived
through adulthood. Downregulation of TAZ/YAP in Lats1/2-deﬁ-
cient peripheral nerves was conﬁrmed by a downregulation of
TAZ/YAP target genes Ctgf, Cyr61, and Ccnd1 (Figure 5A).

We observed that reduced TAZ/YAP expression in Lats1/
2-deﬁcient SCs markedly extended the survival of Lats1/2-def-
TazLo/LoYap1Lo/Lo mice (Figure 5B), although Lats1/2-def-
TazLo/LoYap1Lo/Lo mice, recorded on the Kaplan-Meier curve,
had to be ethically sacriﬁced prior to their natural death due to
ulcers on some dermal tumors. Nevertheless, we detected
signiﬁcantly reduced numbers of visible tumor lesions derived
from the skin and paraspinal regions in Lats1/2-deﬁcient mice
with TAZ/YAP haploinsufﬁciency (Figures 5C and 5D). TAZ/
YAP inactivation in Lats1/2-deﬁcient mice reduced SC numbers
and proliferation to a low level in SNs (Figures 5E–5G). In addi-
tion, Lats1/2-def-TazLo/LoYap1Lo/Lo nerves restored relatively
normal MBP+ expression comparable to control nerves (Figures

298 Cancer Cell 33, 292–308, February 12, 2018

5H and 5I). These data indicate that TAZ/YAP reduction allevi-
ates tumor burden in Lats1/2-deﬁcient mice.

TAZ/YAP Activation Drives the Oncogenic
Transformation of Lats1/2-Deﬁcient Schwann Cells
We next sought to deﬁne the mechanisms whereby TAZ/YAP
drives malignant transformation of SCs. To avoid the complexity
of cell-type heterogeneity and to track SC lineage cells within a
tumor, we isolated cells expressing the ccGFP reporter in the
SC lineage by ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from
SNs of control and paraspinal/nerve tumors of Lats1/2-deﬁcient
mice, and subjected them to RNA-sequencing proﬁling (Fig-
ures 6A and S6A). We identiﬁed distinct transcriptome proﬁles
between GFP+ SCs from Lats1/2-deﬁcient and control mice
(Figure 6B).

Both hierarchical correlation clustering and principal compo-
nent analysis showed a strong correlation among Lats1/2-deﬁ-
cient tumor samples, which separately clustered from control
GFP+ SCs (Figures S6B and S6C). Lats1/2 deﬁciency in SCs
led to a set of signiﬁcantly upregulated and downregulated
genes with >2-fold change (Figure 6C). We identiﬁed activation
of tumorigenic pathways in Lats1/2-deﬁcient SCs, including
gene sets associated with the mitotic cell cycle, YAP signatures,
Kras, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, as well as
RB or TP53 loss-of-function (Figures 6D and 6E). Consistently,
GSEA revealed a marked upregulation of YAP-conserved signa-
tures alongside cell-cycle-related pathways in mutant SCs (Fig-
ure 6F), virtually recapitulating molecular events underlying
MPNST pathogenesis (Carroll, 2016). In contrast, gene ontology
(GO) terms associated with normal SC development and myeli-
nation, such as axon ensheathment and SC differentiation regu-
lator EGR2 targets, were markedly downregulated (Figures 6E,
6G, and S6D). Conversely, among the upregulated genes were
those overrepresented in cell growth, cell migration, pathways
in cancer, and MPNST (Figure 6H). We further examined expres-
sion of tumor suppressors NF1 and P53, detecting a reduction in
NF1, but not P53, in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor-bearing SNs (Fig-
ures S6E and S6F). These results suggest that aberrant TAZ/
YAP activation promotes tumorigenic transformation of SCs
through controlling oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways.

HIPPO-TEAD1 Selectively Targets Cancer-Related
Genes in Lats1/2-Deﬁcient Tumor Cells
Since TAZ/YAP do not bind DNA directly, transcriptional re-
sponses to TAZ/YAP are mediated through transcription factor
partners, TEADs (Zanconato et al., 2016). TEAD1 was identiﬁed
as a key TEAD family member in SCs requisite for myelin-related
gene expression (Lopez-Anido et al., 2016; Poitelon et al., 2016).
Therefore, to identify the genes directly regulated by TAZ/YAP,
we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing
(ChIP-seq)
to assess TEAD1 genome-wide occupancy in
Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells. The majority of TEAD1 peaks
were associated with active histone marks, H3K27Ac and
H3K4me1 (Figures 7A–7C), depicted by a bimodal distribution
around TEAD1 peaks, suggesting that a large proportion of
TEAD1 peaks are located in enhancer
regions. Moreover,
genome-wide accessibility patterns assayed by the assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-
seq) robustly deﬁned open chromatin at TEAD1 binding sites

across the genome in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells (Figure 7C),
suggesting that TEAD1 occupies the enhancers with open chro-
matin structure, which is associated with active transcription
processes.

By analyzing the distribution of TEAD1-bound genomic re-
gions, we detected a small fraction of peaks mapped close to
the transcriptional start site (TSS), while the majority of peaks
were located in intergenic regulatory regions (Figures 7D and
S7A). Gene enrichment analysis by ToppGene suite (Chen
et al., 2009) identiﬁed TEAD1-bound genes marked by the active
enhancer mark H3K27Ac as overrepresented in HIPPO signaling
pathway, PDGF signaling, cell motility, and advanced cancer
and tumor progression genes (Figure 7E). Remarkably, among
TEAD1 target genes that were differentially expressed due to
Lats1/2 ablation, 65% were upregulated (Figure 7F), consistent
with the notion that TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 chieﬂy functions as a tran-
scriptional activator complex for oncogenesis (Harvey et al.,
2013; Zanconato et al., 2016).

Among the top activated TEAD1 targets were those pertinent
to tumor progression, MPNST, HIPPO signaling, and cell migra-
tion (e.g., Fscn1, Ddr1, Epha2) (Figures 7G and 7H). Strikingly,
we detected a strong enrichment of TEAD1 occupancy in the
promoter/enhancer regions of HIPPO (e.g., Cyr61, Amotl2,
Ankrd1) and pro-oncogenic genes, marked by H3K4me3 and/
or H3K27Ac, including Dusp6, Ccnd1, Bcl2, and Mdm2, leading
to an activation of these genes (Figures 7I and 7J). In addition,
upregulation of TEAD1-associated genes enriched for an em-
bryonic phenotype (e.g., Cdh2, Eya4, and Shroom3) suggests
acquisition of progenitor-like or immature cell signatures by
SCs upon aberrant TAZ/YAP activation (Figure 7H). ATAC-seq
revealed an open chromatin conformation at TEAD1-occupied
loci of cancer-related genes in mutant cells, but not in normal
SCs, although chromatin structure was unaltered at SC-spe-
ciﬁc gene loci (Figures S7B–S7G). This suggests active tran-
scription of oncogenic genes with TAZ/YAP hyperactivity.
Consistently, ChIP assays conﬁrmed that these sites were
strongly occupied by TEAD1 in Lats1/2-deﬁcient cells, but not
in normal SCs (Figure S7H).
the functions of
TEAD1-repressed genes were related to myelin sheath, cell dif-
ferentiation, as well as tumor suppressive functions (Figures 7G
and 7H).

In contrast,

To determine whether HIPPO co-activators TAZ/YAP can be
recruited by TEAD1 for gene activation, we performed TAZ
ChIP-qPCR in normal SCs and Lats1/2-deﬁcient cells. TAZ
was signiﬁcantly enriched at the TEAD1 consensus binding sites
in the regulatory elements of TAZ/YAP targets, cell proliferation,
and PDGF pathway genes in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells (Fig-
ure S7I), suggesting that TEAD1 recruits transcriptional activator
TAZ to activate a cancer cell growth program.

Motif enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation in
consensus binding sites of growth-promoting factors, Fra-1/
AP1, Sox2/10, and Stat3, within TEAD1 peaks (Figure S7J).
Together,
these data indicate that TEAD1 transcriptionally
targets the genes encoding the regulators of cancer-related
processes, suggesting that HIPPO signaling dysregulation
switches on the oncogenic growth program that leads to SC
transformation.

Co-targeting TAZ/YAP and PDGF Signaling Impedes
Lats1/2-Deﬁcient Tumor Progression
By integrating transcriptome proﬁling and ChIP-seq analyses,
we found that HIPPO-TEAD1 selectively targeted and robustly
upregulated genes in the PDGF pathway, such as Pdgfa, Pdgfb,
Pdgfrb, and Raf1, in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells, but not in
normal SCs (Figures 8A, 8B, S7F, S7H, and S7I). PDGFA gene
ampliﬁcation and PDGFRA activating mutations have been
reported in NF1-related MPNSTs (Holtkamp et al., 2006), and
PDGF signaling is activated in both NF1-related and sporadic
MPNSTs (Perrone et al., 2009), suggesting the relevance of
PDGF signaling activation by the TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 axis to
human MPNST. Consistent with the stimulation of PDGF
signaling, ERK activity (p-ERK) was elevated in Lats1/2-deﬁcient
nerves (Figure 8C).

We next assessed whether tumor cells with Lats1/2 ablation
were sensitive to inhibition of PDGF signaling by treating
Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells with PDGF receptor (PDGFR) inhib-
itors, imatinib or sorafenib, a dual-action inhibitor that targets
PDGFR and RAF1 pathways (Adnane et al., 2006; Ohishi et al.,
2013). Imatinib or sorafenib treatment exerted a dosage-depen-
dent inhibition of the proliferation in mutant tumor cells (Figures
8D and 8E). The activation of both TAZ/YAP and PDGF signaling
in Lats1/2-deﬁcient nerves provides a rationale to apply com-
bined treatments to curb tumor growth. In light of the inhibition
of tumor cell proliferation by TAZ/YAP blockers, verteporﬁn or
dobutamine (Figures 8D and 8E), we examined whether co-tar-
geting HIPPO-TAZ/YAP and PDGF signaling could additively
impede Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cell proliferation. Although inhi-
bition of the individual pathway with a high drug dosage ex-
hibited some efﬁcacy on blocking cell proliferation in vitro, indi-
vidual drug treatment at a reduced dose (1/3 of highest doses
tested) was largely ineffective (Figure 8F). In contrast, combined
inhibition of HIPPO-TAZ/YAP and PDGF signaling efﬁcaciously
attenuated Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cell proliferation (Figure 8F).
To assess the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors in vivo,
we treated athymic nude mice implanted with Lats1/2-deﬁcient
cells daily with a single dose of verteporﬁn (50 mg/kg), sorafenib
(40 mg/kg), or imatinib mesylate (50 mg/kg). Although the sin-

resulting in reduced tumor size and weight (Figures 8G–8K).
Neither sorafenib, imatinib, nor verteporﬁn alone signiﬁcantly

We further examined the effects of TAZ/YAP inhibitors on

the growth of human MPNST cell
SNF96.2. Both verteporﬁn and dobutamine exhibited a con-
centration-dependent inhibition of MPNST cell proliferation

(Figures S8C and S8D). We also found that targeting PDGFR
signaling by imatinib or sorafenib reduced bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU+) proliferative SNF02.2 cell number in a dose-depen-
dent manner (Figure S8C). Strikingly, combined treatment of
verteporﬁn with sorafenib or sorafenib/imatinib at reduced
dosage was most effective when compared with single-agent
treatment in both MPNST cell
lines (Figure 8L). Collectively,

TAZ/YAP and PDGFR signaling activity can additively atten-
uate the growth of Lats1/2-deﬁcient GEM-PNST tumors and
human MPNST cells.

DISCUSSION

Our analyses reveal that robust TAZ/YAP activation is prevalent
in human NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs. Despite the
rare occurrence of mutations in the HIPPO pathway, HIPPO
signaling dysregulation may arise from molecular events such
as epigenetic alterations of tumor suppressor genes LATS1,
LATS2, MST1, or MST2 (Harvey et al., 2013; Zanconato
et al., 2016). Strikingly, LATS1 or LATS2 mutations have
recently been reported in human peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mors (Kim et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2015). In the present study,
we show that a deﬁciency in Lats1/2 in SCs induces TAZ/
YAP hyperactivity and causes MPNST-like tumors with full
penetrance and a latency shorter than most other animal
models (Carroll, 2016). Our studies establish a unique aggres-
sive animal model of MPNST induced by Lats1/2 deﬁciency,
which resembles the clinically relevant genetic lesions, anatom-
ical locations in the dermis, paraspinal and peripheral nerves,
tumor grade, and lineage of origin of the corresponding human
tumors, suggesting that HIPPO kinases Lats1/2 may function
as a hitherto unrecognized potent tumor suppressor in MPNST
transformation.

Notably, mutations in NF2/Merlin, an upstream regulator of
Lats1/2, lead to benign schwannomas (Guerrant et al., 2016)
and occasionally high-grade tumors (Gehlhausen et al., 2015).
However, Lats1/2 depletion in SCs predominantly generates
malignant tumors coherent with MPNST. The exact mechanism
underlying phenotypic divergence between Nf2-null and Lats1/2
deﬁciency is not known. It is possible that NF2 acts as one of
several upstream regulators and thereby only partially affects
Lats1/2 activation. Intriguingly, adult SC-speciﬁc Nf2-null mice
do not exhibit TAZ/YAP activation (Mindos et al., 2017).
Lats1/2 may exert a more potent tumor suppressive function
through regulating multiple growth pathways (Harvey et al.,
2013; Zanconato et al., 2016).

Our integrative transcriptome proﬁling and genome occu-
pancy analyses reveal that Lats1/2 deﬁciency sustains TAZ/
YAP activity at least in part through TEAD1 that pervasively acti-
vates a global network of oncogenic pathways in SCs, including
RAS/ERK signaling, PDGF signaling, cell cycle and cell migration
regulators, that promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Our
analyses indicate that other pathways, such as NF1 or RB path-
ways, could be suppressed by stochastic genetic or epigenetic
mechanisms during Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor development. In
parallel, constitutive TAZ/YAP activation enforces the de-differ-
entiation program in SCs by upregulating progenitor/stemness
gene signatures and inducing SC hyperproliferation and de-dif-
ferentiation into stem/progenitor-like cells (Figure 8M), in keep-
ing with TAZ/YAP reprogramming of benign cells to cancer
stem cells for driving malignancy in other contexts (Cordenonsi
et al., 2011).

Activation of the HIPPO-TAZ/YAP pathway is a shared phe-
nomenon for both NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs, sug-
gesting that TAZ/YAP hyperactivity acts as a convergence point

304 Cancer Cell 33, 292–308, February 12, 2018

for MPNST pathogenesis regardless of NF1 state. Notably, an
elevated TAZ/YAP transcriptional response appears to distin-
guish MPNSTs from neuroﬁbromas, suggesting that TAZ/YAP
activation, which switches on oncogenic programs, correlates
with the malignant transition of nerve sheath tumors. TAZ/YAP
hyperactivation likely endows SCs with cancer stem cell-like
attributes, which potentially drives tumorigenic transformation
of SCs, highlighting the signiﬁcance of HIPPO signaling pertur-
bation in peripheral nerve malignancy. Our ﬁndings further point
to dysregulation of HIPPO signaling as a potential predictive
biomarker for malignant transformation of existing benign nerve
sheath tumors.

Using spatially and temporally regulated Cre drivers to ablate
Lats1/2 in the SC lineage at various developmental
time
points allows us to deﬁne the cellular stage(s) of SCs conducive
to GEM-PNST formation. Although Cre-mediated Lats1/2
depletion occurs in Dhh-expressing SC precursors during
embryogenesis, Lats1/2 ablation does not appear to disturb
SC differentiation and initiation of myelination during postnatal
development
(Figure S2). The effects of Lats1/2 loss only
become obvious from postnatal week 3, when mature SCs start
to de-differentiate and persistently proliferate.
Importantly,
Lats1/2 ablation in mature SCs by Plp1-CreERT in adult mice
initiates high-grade GEM-PNST formation, indicating that differ-
entiated SCs, including non-myelinating or perhaps myelinating
SCs, may undergo a phenotypic shift through reprogramming
into a cellular state susceptible to tumor transformation in the
absence of Lats1/2. In contrast, deletion of other tumor sup-
pressor genes such as Nf1 in SCs in adult mice rarely leads
to high-grade GEM-PNST formation (Carroll, 2012). Tumori-
genic transformation of mature SCs by the Lats1/2 loss
challenges the notion of MPNST being mainly a disease of
SC precursor cells (Hirbe et al., 2016). Our data show that sus-
tained TAZ/YAP activation by Lats1/2 deﬁciency potently
promotes tumorigenic conversion of mature SCs without the
need for other tumor suppressor mutations, suggesting the
remarkable plasticity and susceptibility of mature SCs to
tumorigenic transformation.

Current therapies for MPNST are associated with long-term
deleterious side effects and have not improved signiﬁcantly in
several decades (Bradford and Kim, 2015). Aberrant HIPPO
signaling in a wide array of MPNST subtypes pinpoints TAZ/
YAP as prime candidates for molecularly targeted therapy. We
demonstrate that TAZ/YAP inhibition in Lats1/2-deﬁcient allo-
grafts or in human MPNST cells in vitro, by verteporﬁn, a US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound,
inhibits tumor growth. HIPPO signaling has been shown to regu-
late multiple cell growth pathways such as those of insulin,
G-protein coupled receptors, and Wnt signaling (Harvey et al.,
2013). The Lats1/2-TAZ/YAP axis may serve as a nexus whereby
diverse tumorigenic signals converge by orchestrating HIPPO
signaling and other oncogenic pathways in regulating MPNST
initiation or progression.

Our genome-wide target identiﬁcation further reveals the
PDGF pathway as a TAZ/YAP-TEAD target upregulated in
response to Lats1/2 depletion. This ﬁnding is intriguing since
activation of PDGFR signaling is present in MPNST and pro-
motes SC hyperplasia (Holtkamp et al., 2006; Ohishi et al.,
2013; Perrone et al., 2009). Although effective in attenuating

MPNST cell growth in vitro and in xenograft models, the use of
the FDA-approved PDGFR inhibitor imatinib hardly resulted in
any response against MPNST in previous clinical trials (Chugh
et al., 2009). A plausible explanation might be that in MPNST,
activated TAZ/YAP confers resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents in tumor cells, which gradually bypass dependence on
their initiating oncogenic mutations, as described in other con-
texts (Zanconato et al., 2016). We show that attenuation of
TAZ/YAP and PDGFR activity by combinatorial treatment with
verteporﬁn and sorafenib decelerates the cell proliferation of
Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor and human MPNST cells. In in vivo treat-
ment studies, we observed a delay of tumor growth rather than
tumor regression, suggesting that the drugs tested exerted cyto-
static instead of cytotoxic effects. Since multiple oncogenic
pathways are upregulated in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumors, further
investigation into more druggable targets and combination ther-
apeutic options is warranted for effective inhibition of tumor
growth. Given the activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway in MPNST,
it is conceivable that concomitant targeting of TAZ/YAP activity
and growth factor receptor pathways, such as PDGFR-RAF/
MEK/ERK, might enhance synthetic lethality toward improving
treatment efﬁcacy in MPNST.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

or Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/lox;Cre+/ 

Animals
Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox mice (Heallen et al., 2011), on a mixed C57/Bl6;129Sv;FVBN background, were crossed with Dhh-Cre (Jaegle
et al., 2003) mice or Plp1-CreERT (Stock 005975) mice, both on a C57/Bl6 background to obtain Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;Cre+/ 
mice (F1
generation). We bred Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;Cre+/ 
mice (F1) with Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox to obtain Lats1/2-deﬁcient offspring
(Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/+;Cre+/ 
. Lats1/2 double knockout mice, Lats1/2lox/lox;Dhh-Cre+/ 
were embryon-
ically lethal and were not analyzed. Littermates (Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox, Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+ or Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;Cre+/ 
) were used as
controls for experiments. Recombination in 6-8-week-old mice was achieved in Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/+;Cre+/ 
or Lats1lox/+
Lats2lox/lox;Cre+/ 
with the inducible Plp1-CreERT under the control of the Plp1 promoter followed by tamoxifen injection. The re-
porter mice CAG-tdTomato (Stock 007909), CAG-CAT-EGFP (ccGFP) (Stock 024636) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.
We bred a CAG-CAT-EGFP (ccGFP) reporter line on C57/Bl6;FVBN with Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox on a mixed C57/Bl6;129Sv;FVBN
background to obtain Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox;ccGFP or Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;ccGFP mice, which were then crossed with Lats1lox/+
Lats2lox/+;Dhh-Cre+/ 
to produce Lats1/2-deﬁcient;ccGFP mice for FACS and RNA-sequencing analysis. Littermate controls used
for RNA-sequencing were ccGFPlox/+;Dhh-Cre+/ 
or Lats1lox/+
Lats2lox/+;ccGFPlox/+;Dhh-Cre+/ 
. CAG-tdTomato reporter line on C57/Bl6 was crossed with Plp1-CreERT on C57/Bl6 to obtain
CAG-tdTomato; Plp1-CreERT+/- mice. Tazlox/loxYap1lox/lox (Deng et al., 2017) mice, on a mixed C57/Bl6;129Sv;FVBN background,
were bred with Lats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox to generate Tazlox/+Yap1lox/+Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+ or with Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;Dhh-Cre+/ 
to
generate Tazlox/+Yap1lox/+Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+;Dhh-Cre+/-. The offsprings of these mice were intercrossed to generate Lats1/2-def-
TazLo/Lo/Yap1Lo/Lo mice. Littermate controls were Tazlox/+Yap1lox/+Lats1lox/+Lats2lox/+ or Tazlox/loxYap1lox/loxLats1lox/loxLats2lox/lox. Lit-
termates were used as controls for most experiments.

, Lats2lox/+;ccGFPlox/+;Dhh-Cre+/ 

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was determined by a cohort of Lats1/2-deﬁcient, Lats1/2-def-TazLo/Lo/Yap1Lo/Lo mice with their
corresponding littermates as controls. All offsprings were maintained on mixed C57/Bl6;129Sv;FVBN background and housed in a
vivarium with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The differences in tumor progression in each Lats1/2-deﬁcient animal might be due to the
differences in Cre recombination efﬁciency for ﬂoxed allele deletion in individual SCs and/or genetic backgrounds. We observed full
penetrance of the tumor phenotype in all Lats1/2-deﬁcient mutants (n R 104), which essentially excludes the possibility of random
genetic drift on an outbred background accounting for tumor formation. All animal experiments were conducted in mice of both gen-
ders and approved by IACUC at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. All experiments conform to IACUC regulatory
standards.

Human Tumor Samples
Human neuroﬁbroma, MPNST and normal nerves were collected according to institutional review board-approved protocols from
discarded surgical specimens, and were received from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Bio Bank as ﬂash-frozen or parafﬁn
embedded samples. All human samples were obtained with consent under approval by the Institutional Review Board committees
at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

Human Microarray Sample Analysis
We collected the microarray expression proﬁles of human normal nerves, neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs from the GEO public resource
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and the accession numbers are GSE41747 (Jessen et al., 2013) and GSE66743 (Kolberg et al.,
2015). The normalized values from these datasets were analyzed for gene expression scores. YAP signature genes are from Molec-
ular Signatures Database v5.1 (Cordenonsi_YAP_Conserved_Signature) (Cordenonsi et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005) and YAP
activated signature (ERMS) was according to the list of activated genes provided in (Tremblay et al., 2014). The mean expression
values of all genes within a given signature represent the expression score of the corresponding gene signature, i.e. all 57 genes
within the YAP conserved signature gene set or 473 genes within the YAP activated signature gene set.

Primary Rat SCs, Mouse SCs, Mouse Tumor Cells and Human MPNST Cell Lines
Rat SCs from SNs of newborn rats (1–2 days-old) were isolated as described previously (Wu et al., 2016). SCs were grown routinely in
DMEM/10% FBS (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10 ng/ml Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1; R&D Systems), and 5 mM forskolin (Sigma),
plus L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin, hereafter termed SC proliferation medium. Cells between passages 2 and 6 were used
in all experiments. >95% SC purity was achieved, assessed by Sox10 and S100b staining. Lats1/2-deﬁcient mouse paraspinal tu-
mors were isolated, minced into 1 mm3 pieces and dissociated using collagenase type I (156 U/ml, Worthington) and dispase II pro-

C. Tumor cells were propagated as an adherent layer on tissue culture dishes in proliferation medium
tease (1.25 U/ml, Sigma) at 37
composed of DMEM/10% FBS plus L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Human MPNST cell lines SNF02.2 and SNF96.2 were
propagated in DMEM/10% FBS plus L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. All tissue culture containers and coverslips for rat SC
cultures were coated with 50 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in PBS for at least 30 min at room temperature and then rinsed in
distilled water.

Adult mouse SCs from SNs of control mice (5 weeks to 4 months old) were isolated as follows: Brieﬂy, adult mouse sciatic nerves
were pre-degenerated in vivo by nerve crush at midthigh level. Injured nerves were harvested 5-6 days post crush. Epineurium was
removed and nerves were separated into several large bundles by ﬁne forceps. Isolated nerves were then dissociated in a cocktail of
collagenase type I (0.1% w/v, Worthington) and dispase II (0.3% w/v, Sigma) in 13 HEPES buffer at 37
C for 2 hr. Small debris was
ﬁltered by a 70 mm cell strainer. SCs were plated in DMEM/10% FBS plus L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin overnight, followed
by washes in HBSS the next day. Medium was replaced with the above-mentioned SC proliferation medium. Mouse SCs were
cultured in tissue culture containers or coverslips coated with 50 mg/ml poly-L-lysine and 2 mg/ml laminin (R&D Systems 3400-
010-01). >90-94% SC purity was achieved, assessed by P75NTR, Sox10 and S100b staining. Primary dissociated SCs at conﬂuency
was further FACS-sorted using an anti-P75NTR antibody (Rabbit, Millipore #07-476) and a secondary antibody, APC Goat anti-rabbit
IgG (H+L) (Southern Biotech 4050-11S). FACS sorted p75+ cells were propagated to generate puriﬁed SCs.



Puriﬁed rat SCs, Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells or human MPNST cell lines SNF02.2 and SNF96.2 seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated
coverslips were ﬁxed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes and washed in 1x PBS 4 times prior to immunoﬂuorescence
staining. For BrdU pulse labeling, cells were incubated with 20 mM BrdU at deﬁned lengths of time prior to ﬁxation.

METHOD DETAILS

Immunoﬂuorescence Staining, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Electron Microscopy
The SNs of mice at deﬁned ages were dissected and ﬁxed for 45 min in 4% PFA, embedded in OCT, cryoprotected in 25% sucrose
and sectioned at 9 mm as longitudinal sections. Mouse peripheral nerves, dermal and paraspinal tumors were dissected, perfused
and ﬁxed overnight in 4% PFA, embedded in parafﬁn and sectioned at 5 mm. For parafﬁn sections, slides were deparafﬁnized, rehy-
drated and subjected to citrate-based antigen retrieval, then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. After washing with PBS for
three times, sections were either incubated for 1 hr with biotinylated secondary antibodies, followed by ABC kit (Vector labs) appli-
cation and the peroxidase/diaminobenzidine (DAB) method to visualize signals under light microscopy, or incubated with ﬂuoro-
phore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch).

For immunoﬂuorescence and immunoperoxidase staining, we used antibodies to TAZ (Rabbit; Proteintech 23306-1), YAP (Rabbit;
Cell Signaling Technology, #4912), TAZ/YAP (Rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology, #8418), Sox10 (Goat, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-
17342; Rabbit, Abcam ab180862), Krox20 (Rabbit; Covance, PRB-236P), MBP (Goat; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13914), Sox2
(Goat; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-17320), Ki67 (Rabbit; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, RM-9106), BrdU (Rat; Abcam, ab6326), a-SMA
(Mouse; Sigma, clone 1A4, A2547) cleaved Caspase 3 (Rabbit; Cell signaling, #9661), S100b (Mouse; Sigma, SAB1402349). Second-
ary antibodies conjugated to Cy2, Cy3 or Cy5 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. All immunoﬂuorescence-labeled
images were acquired using a Nikon C2+ confocal microscope.

For immunolabeled cell quantiﬁcation, images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-E SpectraX wide ﬁeld microscope. For immunohis-
tochemistry, tumors were dissected and ﬁxed overnight in 4% PFA, followed by clearing in 70% ethanol, dehydrated and embedded
in parafﬁn. H&E (H&E) and Masson trichrome staining were in accordance with standard protocols. Images were acquired on a Nikon
Eclipse 80i or Olympus BX53 bright ﬁeld microscope.

For electron microscopy, mice were perfused with 4% PFA, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2.
Sciatic nerves were dissected and ﬁxed in the same ﬁxative solution overnight. Nerves were rinsed in PBS, postﬁxed in 1% OsO4
in PBS for 1 hr, dehydrated in graded ethanol, inﬁltrated with propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon. Semithin sections were
stained with toluidine blue, and thin sections were stained with lead citrate. Images of ultrathin sections were acquired on a JEOL
1200 EXII or Hitachi H7650 electron microscope.

Transient Transfections and siRNA Knockdown
For plasmid transfections, rat SCs were transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) per the
manufacturer’s protocol for 48 hr and assayed for immunocytochemistry or qRT-PCR analysis. For quantitation, GFP+ were counted,
and the percentage of GFP+ cells that expressed the protein of interest was determined. At least 100 GFP+ cells/coverslip were
counted.

For siRNA knockdown in Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells or human MPNST cells, we used Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Tech-
nologies) per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested after 72 hr for immunocytochemistry or qRT-PCR analysis. For

e4 Cancer Cell 33, 292–308.e1–e7, February 12, 2018

double siRNA knockdown, tumor cells in proliferation medium were transfected with speciﬁc Taz-siRNA and Yap1-siRNA
simultaneously.

In Vitro Drug Treatment
For in vitro drug treatment, verteporﬁn (S1786, Selleckchem) and sorafenib p-Toluenesulfonate salt (S-8502, LC Laboratories) were
dissolved in DMSO. Dobutamine hydrochloride (D0676, Sigma-Aldrich) and imatinib mesylate (I-5508, LC Laboratories) were
dissolved in distilled water. Tumor cells on coverslips were incubated with drugs at concentrations indicated in the text and ﬁgure
legends for 72 hr and then assayed for immunocytochemistry analysis. Proliferation was assessed by immunostaining for Ki67
and BrdU.

For time-course proliferation experiments, tumor cells on coverslips in a 24-well tissue culture plate were treated with single agents
or combined agents in DMEM/10% FBS, as indicated for the designated time points. BrdU (B5002, Sigma) at 20 mM was added for
the course of the treatment. Medium was changed every other day with fresh drugs and BrdU. Cells were harvested by ﬁxation in 4%
PFA for 20 min and subsequently analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence staining.

Western Blotting
For western blotting, the perineurium and epineurium were removed from SNs prior to snap-freezing and storage at  80
C. Sciatic
nerves, tumors or dissociated tumor cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. western blot
analysis was performed as described previously (Wu et al., 2016). GAPDH (Millipore, MAB374) was used as an input control. we used
antibodies to TAZ (Mouse, BD Pharmingen 560235), YAP (Rabbit, Cell Signaling Technology, #4912), LATS1 (Goat, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology sc-12494), LATS2 (Rabbit, Bethyl Laboratories, A300-479A), TEAD1 (Mouse, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-
393976), neuroﬁbromin (Rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-67), P53 (Rabbit, Cell Signaling Technology, #9282). Secondary anti-
bodies conjugated to HRP were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.

RNA-Sequencing and Data Analysis
Dhh+ Schwann cell lineage-derived GFP+ cell populations from 3-4-month-old control:ccGFP SNs and Lats1/2-deﬁcient:ccGFP par-
aspinal tumors were sorted by ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA of GFP+ cells were extracted using TRIZOL (Life Tech-
nologies) followed by puriﬁcation using a Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo Research).

RNA-seq libraries were prepared using Illumina RNA-Seq Preparation Kit and sequenced by a HiSeq 2500 sequencer. All RNA-Seq
data were aligned to mm10 using TopHat with default settings. We used Cuff-diff to (1) estimate FPKM values for known transcripts
and (2) analyze differentially expressed transcripts. In all differential expression tests, a difference was considered signiﬁcant if the q
value was less than 0.05 (Cuff-diff default). Heatmap of gene expression was generated using R language (http://www.r-project.org).
GO-analysis of gene expression changes was performed using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/
index.jsp). Normalized enrichment score (NES) reﬂects the degree to which the gene-set is overrepresented at the top or bottom
of a ranked list of genes. The GSEA summary plots in Figures S1A, S1B, and 6E showing upregulated and downregulated pathways
were plotted according to (https://www.biostars.org/p/168044/). Genes categorized with negative or positive NES are downregu-
lated or upregulated, respectively. Circle size is proportional to the number of signiﬁcant genes deﬁned here as the number of genes
represented in the leading-edge subset, i.e. the subset of members within a gene set that shows statistically signiﬁcant, concordant
differences between two biological states and contribute most to the NES. Gene sets with FDR q values < 0.25 are plotted as a func-
tion of NES. Circle colors represent FDR q values.

We used ToppCluster (https://toppcluster.cchmc.org/) to construct the network of genes belonging to over-represented GO-term
categories. For the volcano plot, the up-regulated and down-regulated genes were represented by red or blue dots respectively (fold
change >2, p < 0.02 between control GFP and Lats1/2-deﬁcient GFP cells). Gray dots represent insigniﬁcantly changed genes with
p > 0.02. The gene expression signatures for pathway analysis were from Molecular Signatures Database v5.1 (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The mean expression values were calculated using all genes within a given signature for the heatmap analysis (Subramanian
et al., 2005). The heatmap in Figure 7J was generated based on log2 [FPKM] by AltAnalyze (AltAnalyze.org) with normalization of rows
relative to row mean.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time-PCR
RNA from puriﬁed rat SCs, Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells, human MPNST cells or control and Lats1/2-deﬁcient mouse SNs or tumors
was extracted using TRIZOL (Life Technologies). cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg RNA using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix
(BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. QRT-PCR was performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR was performed using quantitative SYBR green PCR mix (BioRad). PCR primer sequences are avail-
able upon request.

ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq and Data Analysis
Dissociated Lats1/2-deﬁcient mouse tumor cells were ﬁxed for 15 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde-containing me-
dium. Nuclei were isolated and sonicated in sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA and protease in-
hibitor cocktail). Sonicated chromatin (300 mg) was used for immunoprecipitation by incubation with appropriate antibodies (4 mg)

beads (50 ml) were added to each ChIP reaction and reactions were incubated for 1 hr at 4
C. The beads were then incubated in
200 ml elution buffer at 65
C for 20 min to elute immunoprecipitated materials. We performed duplicate ChIP-seq assays using chro-
matin from at least two different cell cultures. The ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using NEBNext ChIP-seq Library Prep Master Mix
Set for Illumina (NEB catalogue number E6240L) and then run on the Illumina sequencer HS2000. The antibodies used were as fol-
lows: TEAD1 (Mouse, BD Biosciences, 610922), H3K4me1 (Rabbit, Abcam, 8895), H3K4me3 (Rabbit, Abcam, 8580) and H3K27Ac
(Rabbit, Abcam, 4729).
ATAC-seq was performed as described in (Buenrostro et al., 2015). Brieﬂy, adult mouse SCs or dissociated Lats1/2-deﬁcient
mouse tumor cells (50,000 cells) were spun down at 500 x g for 5 min at 4
C, and lysed in cold Lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,

C, nuclei were resuspended
pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). After spinning down at 500 x g for 10 min at 4
C for 30 min. Immediately following
in transposition mix containing TD (2x reaction buffer), TDE1 (Nextera Tn5 Transposase) at 37
transposition, DNA were puriﬁed using a Qiagen MinElute PCR Puriﬁcation Kit. Transposed DNA fragments were subsequently
ampliﬁed and the ampliﬁed library was puriﬁed using Qiagen MinElute PCR Puriﬁcation Kit. Libraries were generated using the Ad1_
noMX and Ad2.1–2.4 barcoded primers and were ampliﬁed for 11 total cycles. Libraries were puriﬁed with AMPure beads (Agencourt)
to remove contaminating primer dimers. All libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 75 bp single-end reads.

The sequencing data were mapped to the mm10 genome assembly, and peak calling was performed using Model-based analysis
of ChIP-seq (MACS) version 1.4.2 (http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS) with default parameters, to get primary binding regions. To
 9) and
ensure that our data were of high quality and reproducibility, we called peaks with enrichment R10-fold over control (p%10
compared the peak sets using the ENCODE overlap rules. These identiﬁed primary regions were further ﬁltered using the following
 9; (2) an enrichment of 6.8-fold
criteria, to deﬁne a more stringent protein–DNA interactome: (1) the p-value cutoff was set to % 10
and peak height > 5. For all ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq datasets, WIG ﬁles were generated with MACS, which were subsequently visu-
alized using EaSeq (Lerdrup et al., 2016). TEAD1, H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac ChIPseq and ATAC-seq heatmaps were or-
dered by strength of binding. The heatmaps were drawn using the Heatmap tools provided by Cistrome (http://cistrome.org/ap).
Motif discovery was performed by HOMER software.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays
Brieﬂy, puriﬁed adult mouse SCs or Lats1/2-deﬁcient tumor cells grown in proliferation medium (20 million cells) were ﬁxed for
10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde-containing medium (Wu et al., 2016). Nuclei were pelleted and sonicated in son-
ication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Sonicated chromatin (300 mg)
was used for immunoprecipitation by incubation with IgG or anti-TEAD1 antibody (Mouse, BD Biosciences, 610922; 4 mg) or anti-TAZ
C. 10% of chromatin used for each ChIP reaction was kept as
antibody (Rabbit, Novus Biologicals, NB110-58359) overnight at 4
input DNA. Pre-rinsed protein A/G plus agarose beads (50 ml) was added to each ChIP reaction and incubated for 1 hr at 4
C.
The beads were then incubated in 200 ml elution buffer at 65
C for 20 minutes to elute immunoprecipitated materials. Real-time
PCR was performed using quantitative SYBR green PCR mix (BioRad). The relative fold-enrichments were determined by the
 DCT methods. Samples were normalized to input chromatin. Primers for ChIP-qPCR analysis were designed to ﬂank the TEAD1
2
binding regions (GGAAT) at the regulatory elements of the following gene loci located at the indicated distances from the transcription
start site (TSS), as revealed by TEAD1 ChIP-seq. For primers, see Table S1.

Tamoxifen Injections
Tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) dissolved to a stock concentration of 20 mg/ml in a vehicle of ethanol and sunﬂower seed oil (1:9 v/v). For
adult tamoxifen treatment, 100 ml (2 mg/100 ml) was administered by i.p. injection once daily for 5 consecutive days to 6-8 week-old
mice. Control mice were treated identically. Mice were analyzed 9-16 weeks post tamoxifen administration when tumors were visible.

Allograft Transplantations and In Vivo Drug Treatment
Female athymic NCR nude mice of 6-8 weeks were used for allograft transplantations. Primary Lats1/2-deﬁcient cells from paraspi-
nal tumors were prepared as described above and cells within 2 passages were used in the study. 1-2 3 105 tumor cells diluted in
Matrigel (Corning) and DMEM/10% FBS: 1:2 ratio were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks. Serial dilution transplantation assays
were performed similarly at deﬁned cell numbers as indicated in Figure 3E. For in vivo drug treatment, beginning at the time of tumor
detection, verteporﬁn or sorafenib was diluted in a mixture of 1:1 Cremophor (Sigma, C5135) and EtOH (95:5 v/v). Vehicle was 1:1
Cremophor (Sigma, C5135) and EtOH (95:5 v/v). Imatinib mesylate was diluted in distilled water. For single-agent studies,
 1 imatinib mesylate (Iyoda et al.,

For quantiﬁcation of labeled cells in transfection studies, since the TAZ4SA and YAPS112A expression plasmids carry a GFP-
reporter, GFP+ cells represent TAZ4SA or YAPS112A-transfected cells. The quantiﬁcation was performed by manually
counting antibody co-labeled cells based on the total number of transfected cells indicated by GFP expression. For quantiﬁca-
tion of immunoperoxidase-stained cells, the proportion of immunopositive cells are the number of brown cells (DAB+) based on

total number of cells (brown + blue). MBP+ area of total nerve area was determined using Nikon Elements General Analysis
Software.

For quantiﬁcation of Ki67+ or BrdU+ immunolabeled cells on coverslips, multiple images were taken from each coverslip to obtain
representative images from all areas of the coverslip using a Nikon Ti-E SpectraX wideﬁeld microscope or Nikon C2+ confocal mi-
croscope, and at least 1000 cells/coverslip were counted using Nikon Elements General Analysis software.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All analyses were done using Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism 6.00 (San Diego California, www.graphpad.com). Data are shown in
dot plots or histograms as mean ± SEM, p < 0.05 is deemed statistically signiﬁcant. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but
this was not formally tested. Count data was assumed to be non-parametric, and appropriate statistical tests were used. Statistical
analysis was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests, Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA with post hoc analysis by
Tukey’s multiple comparison test, or Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s or Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, or as indicated. Survival
analyses used animal death times and censoring times when animals were sacriﬁced or as otherwise stated. Survival curves were
plotted with the Kaplan– Meier method and compared by using a two-sided log-rank test. p < 0.05 is considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Quantiﬁcations were performed from at least three experimental groups in a blinded fashion. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the ﬁeld. No randomization was used to
collect all the data, but they were quantiﬁed blindly. No animals or data points were excluded from analyses.
