ERM proteins at a glance

Andrea I. McClatchey*

ABSTRACT

The cell cortex is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure that
governs cell identity and behavior. The ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin
and moesin) are major architects of the cell cortex, and they link
plasma membrane phospholipids and proteins to the underlying
cortical actin cytoskeleton. Recent studies in several model systems
have uncovered surprisingly dynamic and complex molecular
activities of the ERM proteins and have provided new mechanistic
insight into how they build and maintain cortical domains. Among
many well-established and essential functions of ERM proteins, this

on the role of ERMs in organizing the cell cortex during cell division
and apical morphogenesis. These examples highlight an emerging
appreciation that the ERM proteins both locally alter the mechanical
properties of the cell cortex, and control the spatial distribution and
activity of key membrane complexes, establishing the ERM proteins
as a nexus for the physical and functional organization of the cell
cortex and making it clear that they are much more than scaffolds.

Introduction
The ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin and moesin) form a highly
conserved branch of the FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin,
moesin) domain superfamily of proteins and carry out many crucial
cellular functions and carry out many crucial cellular functions
(supplementary material Table S1). (Fehon et al., 2010). Important
insight
into ERM function has come from lower organisms,
fly Drosophila melanogaster, nematode
including the fruit
Caenorhabditis elegans and tunicate Ciona intestinalis,
the
genomes of which harbor single ERM orthologs (Dong et al.,
2011; Go¨bel et al., 2004; McCartney and Fehon, 1996; van Fu¨rden
et al., 2004). The three mammalian ERMs are widely expressed, and
most cell types express multiple ERMs (Ingraffea et al., 2002). It is
widely believed that mammalian ERMs perform at least overlapping
functions, prompting the use of ‘dominant-active’ and ‘dominant-
negative’ versions of ERMs in many studies. However, it is not clear
that mammalian ERMs are truly functionally redundant. Moreover,
recent studies have uncovered surprisingly complex and dynamic
molecular properties of ERMs, suggesting that our understanding of
the mechanisms of action of dominant-acting ERMs is incomplete.
As shown in the accompanying poster, initial molecular models
depict a simple conformational switch that controls ERM
‘activity’, usually held as the ability to link the plasma
membrane to the underlying actin cytoskeleton (Fehon et al.,
2010). In the cytosolic state,
intramolecular self-association
masks protein interaction sites on both the N-terminal FERM
domain and the C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD). This
‘dormant’ conformation is relieved by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-
bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]-binding of the FERM domain and/
or C-terminal phosphorylation, prompting translocation of the
‘active’ protein to the membrane–cytoskeleton interface. This
simple model was based, in part, on early structural studies
(Pearson et al., 2000). Crystallization of the full-length ERM
protein is difficult, and this study analyzed the interaction
between isolated FERM and C-terminal domains but
lacked
insight into the contribution of the intervening a-helical domain.
Subsequent crystallization of a full-length insect ERM revealed
that the a-helical domain can mask additional sites on the FERM
domain, including the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site (Li et al., 2007).
This might help to explain why PtdIns(4,5)P2-association is
essential for subsequent C-terminal ERM phosphorylation in
many contexts (Coscoy et al., 2002; Roch et al., 2010). This also
suggests that the FERM domain might be regulated in modular
fashion, yielding intermediate conformational states. Indeed, a
recent proteomic study supports the existence of multiple
conformational states for ezrin and has even identified proteins
that
specifically interacted with the closed, assumed-to-be
dormant, form of ezrin (Viswanatha et al., 2013). Thus the
early model is significantly oversimplified; instead, the ERMs
likely adopt multiple ‘activation states’ at the plasma membrane.
The ERMs can be phosphorylated on several serine/threonine
and
2014;
Parameswaran and Gupta, 2013). Best-studied is the conserved
C-terminal threonine that lies at the interface between the C-
terminal and FERM domains in the self-associated conformation
(T567 in mammalian ezrin; Pearson et al., 2000). ERMs
harboring phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable residues are
often used as dominant ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ proteins. However,
recent studies have revealed that dephosphorylation of this site is
important
in many contexts, and in some cases, a cycle of
phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation is actually essential to
ERM activity (Kunda et al., 2012; Roubinet et al., 2011;

and Valderrama,

(Clucas

Viswanatha et al., 2012). Such ‘phosphocycling’ of ezrin has
recently been shown to be necessary for the formation of apical
microvilli (Viswanatha et al., 2012). In fact, expression of the
phosphomimetic ezrinT567D can lead to both loss
and
exaggerated stabilization of apical microvilli (Brown et al.,
2003; Go¨bel et al., 2004; Parameswaran et al., 2011; Saotome
et al., 2004). Many kinases have been reported to phosphorylate
this site, and particularly strong evidence implicates SLK family
kinases in both flies and mammalian cells.
the
phosphatase PP1-87B/Sds22 (also known as PPP1R7 in
mammals) can reverse that phosphorylation (Grusche et al.,
2009; Kunda et al., 2012; Parameswaran and Gupta, 2013;
Roubinet et al., 2011). Mounting evidence suggests
that
dephosphorylation and likely active phospho-cycling of ERMs
is important, but
is
spatiotemporally regulated in vivo. Even less is known about the
dynamic phosphorylation of other residues, including a conserved
threonine in the FERM domain that is predicted to directly appose
T567 in the self-associated conformation (Yang and Hinds,
2003).

In flies,

The cloverleaf-shaped FERM domain can interact with numerous
membrane-associated proteins, including transmembrane receptors,
small GTPase regulators and adapters (Fehon et al., 2010;
McClatchey and Fehon, 2009; Neisch et al., 2013). Recent
studies of just two of these interacting partners highlight the
molecular complexity of ERM-associations. The ERM FERM
domain binds with high affinity to the tandem PDZ-domain-
containing adaptors Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 and 2
(NHERF1 and NHERF2; also known as EBP50 and E3KARP,
respectively) (Fehon et al., 2010). This interaction impedes

PDZ interactor of 64 kDa (Epi64) and the NHERF1/2 homolog

et al., 2010). Therefore, the ERMs can assemble a diverse and
highly regulated array of multiprotein complexes at the cell
cortex.

Controlling the mechanical properties of the cell cortex
In addition to assembling membrane complexes,
the ERMs
provide spatially controlled links between the membrane and
underlying actin cytoskeleton. This
in
membrane–cytoskeleton crosslinking has long been appreciated,
but recent studies of ERM function during cell division have
provided crucial insights into how cells exploit this activity to
organize the mechanical properties of the cortex. Insight into the
multiple functions of ERMs during cell division comes from
studies of both Drosophila and mammalian cells. For example, in
adherent Drosophila S2 cells Moesin is necessary and sufficient
for mitotic rounding, during which the cell cortex assumes a more
rigid conformation (Carreno et al., 2008; Kunda et al., 2008;
Thery and Bornens, 2008). Atomic force microscopy has revealed
that Moesin stiffens the cortex of S2 cells during mitotic
rounding; in the absence of Moesin the cortex remains floppy
and unstable. Drosophila Moesin is also important for the
retraction of membrane blebs that form to accommodate the
reduction in membrane area that occurs during mitotic rounding.

Journal of Cell Science (2014) 127, 3199–3204 doi:10.1242/jcs.098343

Similarly, ezrin is required for bleb retraction in constitutively
blebbing mammalian M2 macrophages (Charras et al., 2006). A
key function of mitotic rounding is to provide a mechanically
stable structure that guides the formation and functional integrity
of the mitotic spindle (Thery and Bornens, 2008). Indeed, loss
of Moesin in S2 cells yields multiple defects in spindle
morphogenesis and function that appear to be driven by the
defective interaction of astral microtubules with an unstable
cortex (Carreno et al., 2008; Kunda et al., 2008). In fact, recent
studies suggest that Drosophila Moesin can also associate directly
with microtubules, albeit with low affinity, and that this activity is
essential for communication between the mitotic spindle and
cortical actin cytoskeleton during cell division (Solinet et al.,
2013). In normal cells, the subsequent removal of ERMs from the
cell poles during anaphase relaxes the rigid cortex, guiding cell
elongation and chromosome segregation. Recent studies suggest
that this is driven by the PP1-87B/Sds22 phosphatase, which
reverses C-terminal Moesin phosphorylation specifically at the
polar cortex (Kunda et al., 2012; Roubinet et al., 2011). The
ERMs then become progressively restricted to the contracting
cleavage furrow where they may have additional mechanical
functions during cytokinesis (see poster).

Cortical ezrin also undergoes a dynamic cell cycle-dependent
redistribution in mammalian colonic epithelial (Caco2) cells;
studies of this phenomenon uncovered a direct role for ezrin in
orienting the centrosome and mitotic spindle (Hebert et al., 2012).
When embedded in Matrigel, individual Caco2 cells undergo a
well-studied program of polarized cyst formation (Jaffe et al.,
2008). Recent studies have revealed that in single embedded
Caco2 cells, ezrin is progressively restricted from a uniform
cortical distribution into a discrete actin-rich cap-like structure in
the absence of external spatial cues (Hebert et al., 2012). The
ezrin ‘cap’ forms just prior to S phase and instructively positions
the interphase centrosome and one pole of the ensuing mitotic
spindle, likely providing a stiff platform for astral microtubule
attachment. At
the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, ezrin
vanishes from the polar cortex and reappears at the cleavage
furrow, which becomes the nascent apical lumen around which
cells divide to form a polarized cyst (Hebert et al., 2012).

An intriguing comparison is also provided by studies of cortical
ERM function during oocyte meiosis (Larson et al., 2010). The
immature mammalian oocyte cortex is covered with ERM-
containing microvilli. Meiotic maturation is characterized by the
formation of a more rigid amicrovillar ‘cap’ that is rich in actin
and myosin II, lacks ERMs and is surrounded by the ERM-
containing microvillar cortex. The amicrovillar cap sequesters the
meiotic spindle, guiding its rotation to produce the second polar
body. Interfering with ERM function reduces the effective tension
across the cortex and blocks spindle rotation, impairing normal
meiosis (Larson et al., 2010).

Studies in S2 cells, Caco2 cells and oocytes all conclude that
cortical ERMs play a crucial role in the formation, orientation and
function of the mitotic spindle, but feature distinct patterns of
cortical ERM distribution across the cell cycle. These differences
likely reflect the different physical environments that the cells
experience, that is, attached ventrally to a rigid substrate versus
embedded in a soft substrate versus suspended in a fluidic milieu.
Thus, although cultured S2 cells have to completely transform
their cortex during mitotic rounding, embedded Caco2 cells and
oocytes are already spherical and do not ‘round-up’; this unmasks
their ability to intrinsically establish polarity by restricting
cortical ERMs in a manner that correlates with centrosome or

spindle position. Cells in tissues divide and orient their spindles
within an existing mechanical environment that includes both
cell–substrate and cell–cell attachments. These studies of
individual cells lay the foundation for understanding how the
dynamic spatial distribution of cortical ERMs guides
the
mechanical properties of cells that move and divide within
multicellular tissues.

Building an apical surface
Studies of ERMs in single cells illustrate the importance of ERM
activity in controlling the mechanical properties of the cell cortex
and in establishing cortical asymmetry. This provides a new
framework for considering the well-known function of ERMs in
establishing apical polarity in multicellular contexts. Although it
might be possible to establish apicobasal polarity in the absence
of ERM activity in some contexts, mounting evidence indicates
that the ERMs are fundamental drivers of polarity. In fact, the
asymmetric restriction of ezrin to the outer, apical surface of the
compacting eight-cell mouse embryo is one of the earliest
indications of polarity during mammalian development (Louvet
et al., 1996). During compaction, ezrin is removed from cell–cell
contacts, which is essential for their maturation, and concentrated
at the outer surface, where it is required for the formation of a
primitive, microvillus-containing apical pole. This pole, in turn,
orients the ensuing mitotic spindle, guiding an asymmetric
division that distinguishes outer
from
unpolarized inner cell mass (ICM) cells and defines the first
lineage segregation in the embryo (Dard et al., 2008). Apical Na+
influx, mediated by the ezrin-regulated Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3,
then drives vectorial fluid transport across the trophectoderm,
expanding the blastocoel cavity (Dard et al., 2008; Hayashi et al.,
2013). Thus ezrin drives the formation of the first functional
apical surface in the developing embryo.

The ERM proteins localize to the apical surfaces of many
epithelia and are essential for establishing apical identity and
architecture across many organisms. This is best illustrated by
studies of the conserved role of ERMs in building an apical lumen

is driven by the
formation of a concave inner apical lumen. Lumens can form
through several different cellular mechanisms,

cavitation involving the death of inner nonpolarized cells, or
the de novo creation or ‘hollowing’ of apical surface either within
the junctional surface between two or more cells (cord hollowing)
or intracellularly (cell hollowing) (Andrew and Ewald, 2010;
Datta et al., 2011; Iruela-Arispe and Beitel, 2013). ERM function
has been implicated in all of these, but studies of ERM function in
cord or cell hollowing have yielded the most insight into ERM
function in apical domain formation.

During cord hollowing, cadherin-based cell

junctions are
converted into apical surfaces by a mechanism that is thought
to involve vesicle delivery (Andrew and Ewald, 2010; Datta
et al., 2011). The ERMs are central to this basic molecular
principle, which is used in several different geometric settings.
For example, development of the mouse aorta involves the
moesin-dependent formation of extracellular lumens along the
longitudinal cadherin-based junctions between paired endothelial
cells (Strilic´ et al., 2009). During this process, moesin coordinates
the recruitment of F-actin and myosin, which drives apical
shape change, with that of CD34 sialomucins, ERM-associated
transmembrane proteins whose negatively charged extracellular

glycosyl residues are thought to be antiadhesive (Strilic et al., 2010).
Moesin1 promotes lumen formation in zebrafish intersegmental
vessels by a similar process, suggesting a broad role for moesin in
vascular lumen morphogenesis (Wang et al., 2010). Alternatively,
notochord tubulogenesis in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis involves
the formation of lumens along each of many lateral junctions
between notochord cells, followed by rotation and fusion of the
lumens to create a continuous tube; lumens do not form in the
absence of Ci-ERM (Dong et al., 2011). In another example, the first
division of single Caco2 cells in 3D culture features the
redistribution of ezrin from the polar ‘cap’ to the cleavage furrow,
which is converted into a cadherin-based junction and then into an
apical lumen; cells subsequently divide symmetrically around the
new central lumen to form a multicellular cyst (Hebert et al., 2012;
Jaffe et al., 2008). Ezrin is required for lumen formation in this
setting and ectopic cortical ezrin yields ectopic lumens. Thus, the
plane of division can provide an instructive cue for apical membrane
formation, a mechanism that contributes
to ezrin-mediated
secondary lumen expansion during villus morphogenesis in the
developing mouse intestine (Grosse et al., 2011; Saotome et al.,
2004).

intracellular

junctions. For example,

The importance of ERM function in apical membrane
biogenesis is highlighted by studies of
lumen
formation where apical membrane formation occurs in the
absence of cell
the Caenorhabditis
elegans excretory cell assembles an internal actin-supported
lumenal canal that spans the length of the worm (Zhang et al.,
2013). During canal formation, ERM-1 coordinates the actin-
based extension of apical surface with the transient delivery of
aquaporin-8 that drives transluminal flux, thereby enhancing both
lumen length and diameter (Khan et al., 2013). Both steps involve
the permanent or transient delivery of vesicles to the growing
lumen, suggesting that
there is a direct role for ERM-1 in
executing vesicle-to-plasma-membrane interactions. Such a
model could also apply to the conversion of cell junction into
apical membrane during cord hollowing, which is known to
involve vesicle delivery; perhaps in that setting ERMs coordinate
the delivery of apical components with the removal of junctional
components through vesicular trafficking.

Apical elaboration
Beyond establishing apical domain identity, ERM function is
essential for building specialized appendages that are elaborated
from the apical surface. Best-studied are microvilli, finger-like
actin-based structures that project from the apical surface of most
epithelia, including the intestine and kidney, where they form
exquisitely ordered arrays known as brush borders. Ezrin was
originally identified as a microvillar component and microvilli do
not form properly in its absence in vivo (Bonilha et al., 2006;
Bretscher, 1983; Go¨bel et al., 2004; Saotome et al., 2004).
Microvilli are traditionally thought of as static structures that
serve to increase membrane surface area and receptor content.
However, mounting evidence suggests that they are very dynamic
and, at least in the intestine, can even act as conveyor belts that
shed functional vesicles into the luminal space (McConnell et al.,
2009). In fact, an important series of recent studies have yielded
key insights into both the molecular function of ezrin and the
unexpectedly dynamic molecular properties of microvilli. A key
discovery was that ezrin undergoes constant phosphocycling and
is regulated spatially within the microvillus through restricted
localization and activation of the SLK and LOK kinases at the
microvillus tip (Hanono et al., 2006; Viswanatha et al., 2012).

3202

Moreover, the association between ezrin and NHERF1, which is
also required for microvillus formation, is highly regulated and
unexpectedly dynamic within the microvillus, dashing the
prevailing assumption that NHERF1 is a simple scaffold that
tethers membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton through ezrin
(Garbett and Bretscher, 2012; Garbett et al., 2010). Together with
the discovery that NHERF1, like the ERMs, undergoes regulated
intramolecular and intermolecular interactions (LaLonde et al.,
2010), these studies suggest that ezrin and NHERF1 orchestrate
the dynamic and spatially regulated assembly of perhaps many
different membrane protein complexes along the length of the
microvillus. This, in turn, likely governs the architecture and
biology of the microvillus (Garbett and Bretscher, 2012).

light-sensitive

Studies of ERM function in the rhabdomere, the expanded
light-sensitive apical surface of the Drosophila photoreceptor,
also suggest that there is a dynamic role for ERMs in functional
apical membrane elaboration (Chorna-Ornan et al., 2005;
Karagiosis and Ready, 2004). The rhabdomere is a microvillus-
dense membrane that forms through the periscopic extension and
90-degree rotation of the photoreceptor apical membrane; the

apparatus and holds it perpendicular to incoming light. The
single Drosophila ERM, Moesin, localizes to the rhabdomere
terminal web and is required for rhabdomere architecture and
function (Karagiosis and Ready, 2004; Sengupta et al., 2013).
Moesin associates with photosensitive transient receptor potential
(TRP) channels only in the dark; this association is transiently
relieved by light-induced dephosphorylation and translocation of
Moesin from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm (Chorna-Ornan
et al., 2005). Recent studies suggest that light-induced control of
membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels downstream of TRP channel
activation is essential for maintaining the membrane localization
of Drosophila Moesin and preventing degeneration of
the
rhabdomere microvillar membrane (Sengupta et al., 2013),
providing an elegant example of how the ERMs can act at the
nexus of receptor activity and membrane architecture.

Perspectives
The ERMs are clearly more dynamic and versatile than previously
thought. Studies in lower organisms and single cells are providing
crucial new insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which
cells exploit the ERMs to establish molecular and mechanical
asymmetry. These basic principles will provide a crucial
foundation for understanding the role of ERM-mediated cortical
organization in more complex multicellular contexts, including
tissue morphogenesis, homeostasis and collective migration. A key
goal of future studies will be to carefully study the three
mammalian ERM proteins and determine whether they carry out
distinct functions and/or are differentially regulated. This will
require the development of unique tools that detect and interfere
with the function of each ERM individually. An understanding of
the molecular and cellular functions of mammalian ERMs will
yield new insights into fundamental aspects of mammalian
development and into established links between aberrant ERM
activity and human disease processes, including pathogen–host
interactions, deafness, microvillus inclusion disease, and cancer
development and metastasis (Clucas and Valderrama, 2014;
Dhekne et al., 2014; Hebert et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2007; Kubo
et al., 2008; Skoudy et al., 1999).
