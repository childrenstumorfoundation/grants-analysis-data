ABSTRACT: Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of
the most frequent genetic disorders, affecting 1:3,000
worldwide. Identiﬁcation of genotype–phenotype corre-
lations is challenging because of the wide range clinical
variability, the progressive nature of the disorder, and
extreme diversity of the mutational spectrum. We re-
port 136 individuals with a distinct phenotype carrying
one of ﬁve different NF1 missense mutations affecting
p.Arg1809. Patients presented with multiple caf´e-au-lait
macules (CALM) with or without freckling and Lisch nod-
ules, but no externally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas or
clear cutaneous neuroﬁbromas were found. About 25% of
the individuals had Noonan-like features. Pulmonic steno-
sis and short stature were signiﬁcantly more prevalent
compared with classic cohorts (P < 0.0001). Develop-
mental delays and/or learning disabilities were reported in
over 50% of patients. Melanocytes cultured from a CALM
in a segmental NF1-patient showed two different somatic
NF1 mutations, p.Arg1809Cys and a multi-exon deletion,
providing genetic evidence that p.Arg1809Cys is a loss-
of-function mutation in the melanocytes and causes a pig-
mentary phenotype. Constitutional missense mutations at
p.Arg1809 affect 1.23% of unrelated NF1 probands in
the UAB cohort, therefore this speciﬁc NF1 genotype–
phenotype correlation will affect counseling and manage-
ment of a signiﬁcant number of patients.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM #162200) is one of the
most frequent genetic disorders, characterized by caf´e-au-lait mac-
ules (CALMs), skinfold freckling and Lisch nodules, neuroﬁbromas,
optic pathway gliomas (OPG), and speciﬁc osseous lesions such as
sphenoid wing and tibial dysplasia. Approximately 50% of patients
present as “de novo” cases. NF1, located on chromosome 17q11.2,
has 57 constitutive and at least 3 alternatively spliced exons, spanning
282 kb of DNA. NF1 encodes neuroﬁbromin, a GTPase activating
protein (GAP) down-regulating the biological activity of normal
Ras proteins.

Only a few clinically signiﬁcant genotype–phenotype corre-
lations are known. The ﬁrst concerns a constitutional 1.4 Mb
microdeletion encompassing the NF1 gene. These patients present
with a more severe phenotype, including increased neuroﬁbroma
burden with an earlier age of onset, facial dysmorphism includ-
ing hypertelorism, coarse face, down-slanting palpebral ﬁssures,
broad nasal bridge, ptosis, micrognathia, and developmental de-
lay/ intellectual disability or learning problems [Kayes et al., 1994;
Upadhyaya et al., 1998; Venturin et al., 2003; Descheemaeker et al.,
2004; Mensink et al., 2006; Mautner et al., 2010; Pasmant et al.,
2010]. In addition, congenital cardiac defects such as pulmonic
stenosis (PS), atrial/ventricular septal defects, valve defects, hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy, and patent ductus arteriosus [Venturin
et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2013]; connective tissue anomalies in-
cluding joint laxity and hyperextensible skin; and skeletal anomalies
[Mensink et al., 2006; Mautner et al., 2010] are more frequently
found in these patients. These patients have an increased life-time
risk for a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) [De
Raedt et al., 2003; Mensink et al., 2006]. Childhood overgrowth
and bone age acceleration occurs in patients with the common NF1
microdeletion. This contrasts with classical NF1 patients who have
short stature and whose prepubertal bone age is delayed by 1–2 years
[Carmi et al., 1999].

A second genotype–phenotype correlation involves a speciﬁc one
amino acid NF1 deletion, p.Met992del, which is associated with
a milder NF1 phenotype consisting mainly of pigmentary signs
(CALMs and skinfold freckling) and a lack of externally visible
cutaneous or plexiform neuroﬁbromas [Upadhyaya et al., 2007].
This mild phenotype of CALMs with or without freckling but no
neuroﬁbromas overlaps with and is clinically non-distinguishable
from Legius syndrome (LS), caused by mutations in SPRED1 [Brems
et al., 2007; Messiaen et al., 2009].

The lack of discovery of more speciﬁc genotype–phenotype cor-
relations may be partly due to the methodological approach of
lumping mutations in gross categories, such as truncating, versus in
frame, splicing, and missense mutations [Sabbagh et al., 2013; van
Minkelen et al., 2014]. However, high levels of intra- and interfa-
milial clinical variability are observed in most NF1 families, even
though all affected individuals carry identical NF1 mutations. The
confounding problem is that the phenotype is determined, besides
by the constitutional mutation, by the patient’s age, the timing of sec-
ond hit mutations in different cells and tissues, potential mosaicism
in founder patients and modifying and environmental factors.

We hypothesize that additional genotype–phenotype correlations
exist and likely can be identiﬁed through analysis of preferentially

postpubertal patients carrying the same non-truncating constitu-
tional mutation. Given the extreme diversity of the NF1 mutational
spectrum, with ß46% of patients carrying a private mutation
and only 29 different NF1 mutations present in >0.5% of all
patients [Messiaen, 2008], identiﬁcation of unrelated, preferentially
non-founder probands, and relatives over 8 years of age with an
identical mutation requires large well-characterized patient cohorts.
Multiple (>5) CALMs are usually the ﬁrst sign indicative of NF1
and present shortly after birth. Up to 90% of the patients thereafter
develop skinfold freckling before the age of 8 years, thereby fulﬁll-
ing the clinical criteria of NF1 [Friedman et al., 1986aa]. Typically,
more signs and complications develop thereafter, but few indica-
tors predict the severity of the disorder over time. This uncertainty
negatively impacts quality of life [Vranceanu et al., 2013]. Recently
29 patients from 12 families carrying an NF1 missense mutation
at Arg1809 were reported with a phenotype of multiple CALMs
and freckling, without cutaneous or visible plexiform neuroﬁbro-
mas, Lisch nodules, typical osseous lesions or symptomatic OPGs,
and with facial features suggestive of Noonan syndrome in 50%
[Pinna et al., 2015; Santoro et al., 2015], in line with our initial
ﬁndings [Rojnueangnit et al., 2013]. Here, we report a cohort of
136 patients from 98 unrelated families carrying one of ﬁve dif-
ferent constitutional missense mutations affecting NF1 codon 1809
in exon 29 [38]. Patients presented with multiple CALM, with or
without freckling and Lisch nodules, but externally visible plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (0/78 individuals ࣙ9 years; P < 0.05), symptomatic
optic pathway glioma (0/98 individuals ࣙ5 years; P < 0.02) (Tables
1 and 2) or clear cutaneous neuroﬁbromas were not found. There
was, however, a high incidence of developmental delay/intellectual
disability/learning disorder, PS, short stature, and Noonan syn-
drome features. This mutation was identiﬁed in 1.23% of unre-
lated probands carrying a constitutional NF1 mutation in the UAB
cohort (86/7,000). Missense mutations affecting p.Arg1809 are the
second most frequent mutation in the UAB cohort, second only to
the 1.4 Mb NF1 type 1 microdeletion. This is the third speciﬁc NF1
genotype–phenotype correlation, which will affect counseling and
management of these patients.

Materials and Methods

Patients and Phenotypic Characterization

Phenotypic data of all individuals carrying an NF1 constitutional
missense mutation affecting codon 1809, as provided by the refer-
ring physicians using a standardized phenotypic checklist (Supp.
Fig. S1), were reviewed. Initial results on 67 probands and 17 rel-
atives from UAB were reported at the 2013 American College of
Medical Genetics meeting [Rojnueangnit et al., 2013]. This ini-
tial study was expanded to include 31 additional probands and
21 relatives (from UAB and collaborating centers) and reﬁned by
requesting referring physicians to (i) verify whether the informa-
tion in the originally submitted checklist was accurate and (ii) pro-
vide an update on their patient(s) if additional information had
become available. The phenotypic data documented in the stan-
dardized phenotypic checklist include: age; sex; ethnicity; height;
head circumference; NIH criteria including CALMs, freckling, cu-
taneous, subcutaneous, plexiform and spinal neuroﬁbromas, optic
gliomas, Lisch nodules, osseous lesion, and inheritance (familial,
sporadic); Noonan syndrome features including short stature, ap-
parently low set ears, hypertelorism, midface hypoplasia, webbed
neck, and PS; cardiovascular defect (hypertension, pulmonic, aor-
tic or renal artery stenosis, Moyamoya, ASD, or VSD); develop-
ment (normal, abnormal, ADD, ADHD, learning disability, autism,

speech delay, pervasive developmental delay, IQ) and education;
presence/absence of other neoplasms. The UAB cohort comprises
111 individuals (86 probands and 25 relatives). In addition, 25 indi-
viduals (12 probands and 13 relatives) from four other centers were
included: three Belgian families (six affected individuals) referred to
the Medical Genetics Laboratory at the University Ghent, Belgium
(UG), one Spanish family (three affected individuals) referred to
the Catalan Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain (BARC), four
Spanish families (11 affected individuals) referred to the genetic de-
partment of the “Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal”, Madrid,
Spain (MADR) and four UK probands (three familial with genetic
and full clinical examination available on four individuals and one
proven sporadic individual) evaluated at the Institute of Medical
Genetics, University Hospital of Wales, UK (CARD) were included.
The data for any given sign/symptom reﬂect the number of pa-
tients for whom we received information, that is, after exclusion of
those with entry “unknown” or “Not Speciﬁed.” Screening for Lisch
nodules was not routinely performed in most patients. None of the
patients presented with ophthalmological problems indicative of a
symptomatic OPG, but an MRI to exclude presence of an asymp-
tomatic OPG was not routinely performed, except when stated.
Similarly, imaging or whole body MRI was not available in patients
without signs or symptoms indicative of internal or spinal tumors.
A patient was classiﬁed as having short stature when height was
below or equal to the 3rd percentile (PC), using the World Health
Organization (WHO) growth curve for age less than 2 years, and
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) growth curve for age above
2 years in Caucasian and African-American ethnicity. For the Span-
ish individuals, Spaniards’ growth charts were used as provided at
http://www.webpediatrica.com/endocrinoped/antropometria.php.
As no speciﬁc growth curves are available for the Hispanic and Asian
populations, but average height is lower than in the Caucasian or
African-American population [Hur et al., 2008; Chen and Chang,
2010; de Wilde et al., 2014], we conservatively excluded Hispanic or
Asian patients as having short or normal stature. We still calculated
the PC values using the WHO or CDC growth curves and these
values are provided between square brackets in the Supp. Table S1.
Macrocephaly was deﬁned as the head circumference above the
97th percentile using the WHO curve for age up to 2 years old, and
the Gerhard Nellhaus’ curve [Nellhaus, 1968] for age over 2 years
old, for all ethnic backgrounds.

A patient was classiﬁed as having “NF-Noonan” when at least two
of the following features were present: short stature, low set ears,
hypertelorism, midface hypoplasia, webbed neck, or PS.

Molecular Analyses

All unrelated UAB, UG, BARC, and MADR probands had under-
gone comprehensive NF1-mutational analysis using an RNA-based
approach complemented by DNA-based dosage analysis, as previ-
ously described [Ars et al., 2000; Messiaen et al., 2000; Messiaen and
Wimmer, 2005; Messiaen, 2008; Valero et al., 2011]. Melanocytes
from a CALM of patient UAB-RSeNF23 were cultured as previously
described [Maertens et al., 2007]. RNA and DNA were extracted
from cultured cells and subjected to comprehensive NF1-mutational
analysis. Mutations in CARD individuals were identiﬁed using
DNA-based Sanger sequencing of all coding exons. NF1 mutations
are described following recommendations of the Human Genome
Variation Society using NM 000267.3 as the reference sequence.
Exon numbering uses the historical numbering used by the NF1
consortium, followed by the NCBI numbering in square brackets.

vestigated using High Resolution Melting Curve analysis, as
described [Vossen et al., 2009]. Genomic DNA was diluted to a
concentration of 15 ng/μl. A DNA sample from a non-founder in-
dividual carrying the constitutional mutation c.5425C>T (present
in all cells, 50% of all alleles) was serially diluted with wild-
type control DNA to generate a calibration panel with DNA con-
taining the mutation in 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.13%, and
1.56% of the alleles. All samples were ampliﬁed in duplicate using
Lightscanner R(cid:3)
Master Mix (BioFire Defense) and the PCR products
were subsequently analyzed by the LightScanner R(cid:3)
System (BioFire
Defense).

PTPN11 mutation analysis was performed in probands and rel-
atives with “NF-Noonan” phenotype by Sanger sequencing of all
coding exons and 20 nucleotides of the ﬂanking introns (primer
sequences available upon request).

NP 000258.1 residues 1730–1815 was evaluated using ClustalW2
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2). The
structures of
human NF1 p.Arg1809 mutations (Arg1809Cys, Arg1809Leu,
Arg1809Pro, Arg1809Gly, Arg1809Ser, and Arg1809His) were
predicted through the Analysis function of UCSF Chimera (version
1.10.1), based on the crystal structure of human NF1 (RefSeq
NP 000258.1: PDB-accession code 2D4Q, residues 1560–1816 and
2E2X, residues 1567–1816).

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all

participating institutions offering clinical genetic testing.

Results

The study includes 98 probands and 38 relatives carrying a con-
stitutional missense mutation affecting codon Arg1809, and one
patient with segmental presentation in whom we identiﬁed the mis-
sense p.Arg1809Cys in melanocytes cultured from a CALM, but not
in the blood.

Germline missense mutations affecting codon Arg1809 were iden-
tiﬁed in 86/7,000 unrelated NF1-positive probands through clinical
testing in the UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory (July 2003 to July
2014). Therefore, the frequency of missense mutations affecting this
codon is ß1.23% in individuals submitted for clinical testing with
a positive genetic testing result. This is the codon most frequently
mutated in NF1 in our cohort.

Characteristics and Location of the Mutations

Amongst 98 unrelated probands carrying mutations affecting
codon 1809, ﬁve different missense mutations were observed:
p.Arg1809Cys (75/98), p.Arg1809Leu (15/98), p.Arg1809Pro (4/98),
p.Arg1809Ser (3/98), and p.Arg1809Gly (1/98) and their character-
istics are summarized in Supp. Table S2. None of these variants
have been found in the 1000Genomes, Exome Variant Server or
the ExAC control populations (61,486 unrelated individuals). We
never observed these missenses in a patient carrying a different
clear-cut pathogenic NF1 mutation (out of 7,000 NF1-mutation
positive probands), although a mother and daughter (family UAB-
R5153) carried a complex allele p.[Arg1809Cys;Leu1789Val], with
p.Leu1789Val never observed or reported before and classiﬁed as a
variant of unknown signiﬁcance. Arginine at position 1809 is evolu-
tionarily conserved up to Drosophila melanogaster and yeast IRA2,
whereas the very similar basic amino acid, Lysine, is found at that po-
sition in IRA1 (Supp. Fig. S2). All in silico prediction programs clas-
sify these variants as deleterious (SIFT), disease-causing (Mutation-
Taster), or probably damaging (PolyPhen). Combined Annotation
Dependent Depletion (CADD) v1.0 classiﬁed all missenses as being
more likely pathogenic (PHRED scores ranging from 21.9 to 34).
In addition, MutPred prediction software predicted p.Arg1809Leu
to be a splice affecting variant (score 0.69), whereas the other mu-
tations were predicted to be Splice Neutral Variants. RNA-based
sequencing showed that p.Arg1809Leu and p.Arg1809Pro (but not
p.Arg1809Cys, p.Arg1809Ser, or p.Arg1809Gly) lead to out-of-frame
skipping of exon 29 [38] and exon 29 + 30 [38 + 39] in a minor

fraction of the transcripts. The missense mutations were proven to
segregate with the phenotype in 29 familial cases and to be de
novo in 21 sporadic probands. Taken together, these variants can all
conﬁdently be classiﬁed as pathogenic according to current recom-
mendations [Richards et al., 2015].

Theoretically, substitution of a single nucleotide of the Arg1809
codon CGC can result in six different missense variants: c.5425C>T,
p.Arg1809Cys (codon TGC); c.5426G>C, p.Arg1809Pro (codon
CCC); c.5426G>T, p.Arg1809Leu (codon CTC); c.5425C>G,
p.Arg1809Gly (codon GGC); c.5425C>A, p.Arg1809Ser (codon
AGC) and c.5426G>A, p.Arg1809His (codon CAC). As C>T and
G>A transitions are the most frequently observed mutations at
CpG dinucleotides, due to spontaneous deamination after cytosine-
methylation, we expected ﬁnding p.Arg1809Cys and p.Arg1809His
with equal frequency. However, p.Arg1809His was not found
as a constitutional mutation in mutation-positive clinical sam-
ples submitted at UAB for NF1 testing (0/7,000 vs. 67/7,000 for
p.Arg1809Cys; P < 0.0001), whereas both are absent in the ExAC
control cohort (61,486 individuals). Arg1809 resides within the C-
terminal α-helix of the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain of neu-
roﬁbromin, encompassing the amino acids 1,713 to 1,816 (Supp. Fig.
S2). The function of this α-helix within the domain is unknown,
but might be important for protein-protein interactions given its lo-
cation at the surface of the domain. 3D-modeling indicates that all
Arg1809 missense mutations, including p.Arg1809His, are predicted
to lose a hydrogen bond with Ser1738 (Supp. Fig. S3). To further
investigate the discrepancy in prevalence of p.Arg1809Cys versus
p.Arg1809His, we veriﬁed whether partners were present within
suitable distance from p.Arg1809Cys to form disulﬁde bridges, but
none were found (Supp. Fig. S4).

Phenotypic Description of the Patient Cohort

The NF1 clinical features of 136 individuals with a constitutional
missense mutation affecting Arg1809 and the pedigrees of familial
cases are summarized in Table 1, Table 2, Supp. Table S1, Supp. Ta-
ble S3, Supp. Figure S5, and Supp. Figure S6. Forty of 98 probands
were familial cases, 21/98 were proven to have a de novo mutation
(with no formal paternity/maternity identity testing performed),
16/98 were reported as sporadic cases but one or both parents were
unavailable for testing, and for 21/98 cases family history was un-
known, including two adopted probands.

A 22-year old woman with segmental NF1, UAB-RSeNF23, (>6
CALMs and axillary freckling all restricted to the left side of the
body, Lisch nodules in left eye, no learning disabilities, no OPG,
no PNF or cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, no scoliosis or skeletal dys-
plasia) had no mutations identiﬁed in the blood, but two differ-
ent somatic NF1 mutations in the melanocytes cultured from a
CALM: c.5425C>T (p.Arg1809Cys) and an in-frame deletion of 228
residues, c.(63 205) (888 958)del (p.Arg69 Lys296del).

Age of the individuals ranged from 6 months to 59 years, with
54/136 individuals younger than 9 years, 43/136 between 9 and 18
years, and 39/136 over 19 (10/39 between 19 and 26 years, 8/39
between 27 and 35 years, 16/39 between 36 and 50 years and 5/39
older than 50 years). Seventy-two were male, 64 were female.

Ninety-four out of 136 individuals fulﬁlled NIH clinical crite-
ria, but only 77/136 fulﬁlled NIH criteria if family history was ex-
cluded as a criterion. Fifty-two of 80 (65%) individuals ࣙ9 years
had >5CALMs and skinfold freckling (Tables 1 and 2). Three adults
(familial cases: UAB-R008-I1, UAB-R5863-I1, UAB-R6673-I1) had
only 1–2 CALMs (with irregular margins) without other external
signs. Lisch nodules were rarely present (6/51 individuals ࣙ9 years;
10/91 all ages). A symptomatic OPG was absent in all 98 individuals

ࣙ5 years. Moreover, an asymptomatic optic glioma was excluded
by MRI imaging in 39 individuals, including 32/39 ࣙ5 years. Exter-
nally visible plexiform neuroﬁbroma or symptomatic spinal neu-
roﬁbromas were not found in the 136 individuals in this cohort.
Furthermore, no spinal neuroﬁbromas were found by MRI in six
asymptomatic individuals.

Cutaneous neuroﬁbromas often ﬁrst appear around the time of
puberty and increase in size and number with age. None of the indi-
viduals in this cohort had overt cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, including
39 individuals ࣙ19 years old (and 21/39 >35 years). In ﬁve patients
ࣙ19 years (UAB-R744, 33y; UAB-R7641-I2, 47y; UAB-R0143-I1,
55y; UAB-R4174-I1, 40y; UAB-R4835, 28y; Supp. Tables S1 and
S3), 1–2 small lesions called possibly subdermal/peripheral neuroﬁ-
bromas by the referring physicians were reported; none had been
histopathologically conﬁrmed. In one patient (UAB-R3412, 15y),
multiple intramucosal oral nodules, suspected to be neuroﬁbromas,
were identiﬁed by MRI, but no histology was available.

Scoliosis was found in 6/71 patients older than 9 years. In 3/125
individuals, a long bone dysplasia was present, but pseudarthrosis
or sphenoid wing dysplasia was not seen. Pectus anomalies (pec-
tus carinatum or excavatum, ﬂat rib cage) were reported in 9/125;
macrocephaly (PC ࣙ 98) was present in 20/80.

Noonan syndrome features were present in 32/122 individuals.
No PTPN11 mutation was found in those available for testing (0/22).
PS was present in 13/105 and short stature (PC ࣘ 3) in 29/82. Seven
individuals had a phenotype previously referred to as “Watson syn-
drome,” given the combination of multiple CALMs, PS and learn-
ing disabilities and/or intelligence at the lower end (UAB-R9216,
UG-575, UAB-R8141, UAB-R9851, UAB-R7626, UAB-R2635, and
UAB-R7961). Out of 136 individuals with constitutional missense
mutations at p.Arg1809, no developmental data were provided for 9;
53 were stated as having normal development; three as having nor-
mal development but ADD was reported in two and ADHD in the
one. The remaining 71 individuals were reported to have abnormal
development presenting with one or a combination of the follow-
ing forms of cognitive impairment or learning difﬁculties: learning
disabilities (n = 62), developmental delays (n = 3), ADHD (n = 13),
Asperger syndrome (n = 1), pronunciation problems (n = 1), speech
delay (n = 12), language delay (n = 1), nasal speech and speech
apraxia (n = 1), dyspraxia (n = 1), dyslexia (n = 1), motor delay
(n = 3) (Supp. Table S1 and Table 1). Seven patients had signiﬁcant
learning difﬁculties and intellectual disability, including four with a
Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) between 58 and 75.

A venous malformation (multiple

subcutaneous heman-
giomas/lymphangiomas, six nevi ﬂammei, mildly bluish discol-
oration) and a Becker nevus were found in a child and mother
respectively (family UAB-R9813). A likely regressed hemangioma
(UAB-R0844), a nevus anemicus (MADR-690), multiple cherry an-
giomas (UAB-R9266-I1), hemangiomas on left upper chest (UAB-
R3154-I1), and lumbar hemangioma plus involuted cutaneous he-
mangioma (UAB-R2135) were each found in a single patient.

One or multiple lipomas were reported in three patients. A 24-
year-old woman had a diagnosis of breast cancer, a 50-year-old
woman had a breast ﬁbroadenoma, and an 8-year-old boy had a
Ewing Sarcoma. No follow-up information on these patients was
available.

An Arnold Chiari I malformation was present in three patients
(UAB-R0143-I1, UAB-R5913-II1, and MADR-694-II2). One pa-
tient (UAB-R4517) had abnormal morphologic appearance with
decreased transverse dimensions of the superior frontal lobes bilat-
erally and an unusual sulcation pattern in the superior right frontal
lobe, possibly indicating a multifocal cortical dysplasia. Four pa-
tients had a brain lesion: a stable brain mass of unknown type

(UAB-R9216-I2), glial nodules by MRI (UAB-R3133), a stable dor-
sal medullar lesion suspicious for glioma (UAB-R5625) and a right
thalamic glioma, histologically conﬁrmed as being an astrocytoma
at age 17 years (UAB-R3773) and treated with stereotactic radio-
surgery and chemotherapy due to changes perceived on imaging.

Comparison of Clinical Features in Patients Carrying
Missense Mutations Affecting Codon 1809 with Patients
Carrying The NF1 P.Met992del Mutation, Patients With LS
and Patients with “Classic NF1”

Comparison of clinical features of the p.Arg1809 cohort with
individuals carrying the NF1 mutation p.Met992del [Upadhyaya
et al., 2007], LS [Brems et al., 2012, and references therein and
patients with “classic NF1” as previously reported in large scale
NF1 patient cohorts [Huson et al., 1988; Huson et al., 1989a;
Tonsgard et al., 1998; McGaughran et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2000;
Khosrotehrani et al., 2005] is summarized in Table 2, with sta-
tistical signiﬁcance calculated using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test
(http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/contingency1/).

Compared to large cohorts of classic NF1 patients [Huson et al.,
1988; Huson et al., 1989aa; Listernick et al., 1994; Cnossen et al.,
1998; McGaughran et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2000; Singhal et al., 2002;
Blazo et al., 2004; Khosrotehrani et al., 2005], individuals with a
missense mutation at p.Arg1809 have statistically signiﬁcantly less
cutaneous and externally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas, symp-
tomatic optic gliomas and pectus abnormalities. Fewer patients have
Lisch nodules. Importantly, no individual described in this and pre-
vious cohorts [Nystr¨om et al., 2009; Ekvall et al., 2014; Pinna et al.,
2015] showed visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas (0/107 individuals
ࣙ9 years) or symptomatic optic gliomas (0/119 individuals ࣙ5
years).

Compared with classic NF1 cohorts, individuals with a p.Arg1809
missense mutation had signiﬁcantly increased frequency of PS
(P < 0.0001) and short stature (P < 0.0001). Short stature was also
signiﬁcantly more frequent compared with individuals with NF1
p.Met992del or LS (all P values <0.002).

Phenotype in individuals carrying a p.Arg1809 missense mu-
tation is similar to that of individuals with the NF1 p.Met992del
mutation [Upadhyaya et al., 2007], except for short stature being
more prevalent in the p.Arg1809-positive individuals. In addition,
learning disabilities were more frequently reported in the p.Arg1809-
positive cohort.

95% of individuals with classic NF1 fulﬁll ࣙ2 of the NIH physical
criteria (i.e., not taking family history into account) by ࣙ9 years of
age according to De Bella, National Neuroﬁbromatosis Foundation
International Database [Friedman et al., 1986a]. In contrast, indi-
viduals with mutation at p.Arg1809, p.Met992del or with LS less
likely fulﬁll these criteria at ࣙ9 years of age (all P < 0.0001). Fur-
thermore, individuals with a mutation at p.Arg1809 or p.Met992del
differ signiﬁcantly from individuals with LS, with individuals with
LS being the least likely to fulﬁll NIH criteria by age 9 years. Lisch
nodules were found in patients with a p.Arg1809 mutation, although
rarely (10/91), but have never been reported in LS.

Unusual Families within this Cohort

In 5/21 probands, with proven de novo mutation, one (UAB-
R9044, UAB-R3885, and UAB-R6935) or both parents (UAB-R3933
and UAB-R1583) had 1–4 CALMs. Probands of these families in-
variably had >5 CALMs. p.Arg1809 was not detected in the parental
blood samples by Sanger sequencing or by High Resolution Melt-
ing Curve Analysis (HRMCA), which would detect the mutation
if present at ࣙ3% minor allele frequency (data not shown). This
does, however, not completely exclude parental mosaicism for the
mutation.

Tumor-related phenotypes were strikingly discordant in affected
individuals within two families (Supp. Fig. S6). Comprehensive NF1
genetic testing showed two different mutations segregating within
these two families. In Family UG-575, the 7-year-old proband carry-
ing the missense mutation p.Arg1809Ser had multiple CALMs and
skinfold freckling, Noonan phenotype with PS and severe learning
disabilities with FSIQ of 58. Her father with >6 CALMs, >100 cuta-
neous neuroﬁbromas, a large previously resected plexiform neuroﬁ-
broma in the left leg and enlarged lumbar and sacral nerve roots by
MRI did not carry the mutation p.Arg1809Ser (de novo in UG-575,
with biological relationship of both parents proven by identity test-
ing). Further comprehensive NF1 mutation analysis in him showed
a splice mutation, c. 6365-2A>G, resulting in out-of-frame skipping
of exon 34[43], and absent in his daughter.

In family UAB-R7916, the 41-year-old p.Arg1809Cys-positive
proband had >8 CALMs, skinfold freckling, and PS. Four ﬁrst-
degree p.Arg1809Cys-negative relatives had 1–3 pigmentary lesions
(CALMs or hypopigmentation or freckle). A 2-year-old niece of the
proband with >6 CALM, skinfold freckling and an internal plexi-
form neuroﬁbroma did not carry the mutation p.Arg1809Cys, but
∗
a de novo nonsense mutation c.539T>G, p.Leu180
. Therefore, if a
substantial deviation from the here described phenotype is found in
an inferred (i.e., a relative of an individual with a proven p.Arg1809
missense mutation) as well as in a proven p.Arg1809 missense mu-
tation carrier, further genetic investigations should be pursued.

Discussion

We describe a distinct phenotype associated with ﬁve dif-
ferent NF1 missense mutations (p.Arg1809Cys, p.Arg1809Leu,
p.Arg1809Pro, p.Arg1809Ser, and p.Arg1809Gly) in a large cohort
of 136 individuals. Missense mutations affecting NF1 p.Arg1809
were found in 1.23% of unrelated NF1 mutation-positive individ-
uals in the UAB cohort, therefore the current ﬁndings will impact
management and counseling of a large number of families.

p.Arg1809Cys is the most recurrent missense mutation in the
NF1 gene, found in 68/7,000 (0.97%) unrelated mutation-positive
individuals in the UAB cohort. This variant was initially misclassiﬁed
as a rare polymorphic variant [Ars et al., 2003] due to ﬁnding
this variant in a sporadic individual and presence of the variant in
several “unaffected” individuals (mother and sibling). [Ars et al.,
2003] acknowledged that for some families the clinical information
in their cohort was limited. Nystr¨om et al. (2009) was hesitant
how to classify p.Arg1809Cys in a family consisting of a proband
with severe Noonan syndrome with a de novo PTPN11 as well as
inherited NF1 p.Arg1809Cys missense mutation and four relatives
with multiple CALMs: 2 carrying (sibling and father) and two not
carrying (paternal uncle and cousin) NF1 p.Arg1809Cys. As detailed
examination of the CALMs in the paternal uncle and cousin was
not possible, a different genetic disorder in this branch of the family
cannot be excluded. As other loci for familial CALMs remain to be

discovered [Messiaen et al., 2009], whole exome sequencing may
shed light on the genetic make-up in this and other families. In
addition, several other families have been reported where mutations
in more than one gene, involved in disorders with an overlapping
phenotype, segregated within a family [Bertola et al., 2005; Messiaen
et al., 2009; this study]. Understanding of the phenotypic spectrum
associated with NF1 mutations has expanded signiﬁcantly with the
increased use of NF1 genetic testing and the identiﬁcation of patients
with a speciﬁc mutation such as p.992delMet, who—amongst other
features—do not develop the typical neuroﬁbromas with age and
not all fulﬁll NIH criteria even in late adulthood [Upadhyaya et al.,
2007]. Furthermore, guidelines and recommendations have been
established and reﬁned to help with the standardized classiﬁcation
of genetic variants [Richards et al., 2008; Richards et al., 2015].
Novel NF1 missense variants rarely can be conﬁdently classiﬁed
based on observations in a single proband/family and often remain
a “variant of unknown signiﬁcance” until more evidence becomes
available. Based on the evaluation of >100 unrelated families and
one segmental NF individual (this study, [Nystr¨om et al., 2009;
Ekvall et al., 2014; Pinna et al., 2015; Santoro et al., 2015]) sufﬁcient
evidence is available to classify all ﬁve missense mutations presented
here as pathogenic. The family originally included in the study by
[Ars et al., 2003] was clinically re-evaluated in this study (BARC-
123) and the clinical phenotype was found to be concordant with
the distinct phenotype described here. Nevertheless, further studies
in large Arg1809-missense mutation positive families will reﬁne
our understanding of the phenotypic variability within families and
allow determining whether non-penetrance could exist at this locus,
as suggested by the presence of three individuals with only 1–2
CALMs in our cohort (UAB-R008-I1, UAB-R5863-I1, and UAB-
R6673-I1; it remains unknown if these individuals were founders,
and therefore might have been mosaic).

p.Arg1809 is located at the end of the C-terminal α-helix, close
to the end of the PH-like domain which forms a bipartite module
with the Sec-14 domain. 3D-modeling predicts a loss of a hydro-
gen bond between p.Ser1738 in both the solvent and lipid bound
model for all six missense variants that can arise after a substitution
of the Arg1809 CGC codon, suggesting this may cause a change
in the secondary structure of the PH-like domain with possible
effect on domain interaction and lipid-binding properties of the
adjacent Sec-14 domain. However, other domains involving, for ex-
ample, the amino acids 1817–2818, whose crystal structures remain
unresolved, may affect the stability and structure of this domain,
therefore the predicted loss of the hydrogen bond with p.Ser1738
may or may not be crucial. p.Arg1809His, expected to be equally fre-
quent as p.Arg1809Cys, given the equal likelihood for both variants
to originate as a consequence of deamination after methylation of
the CpG dinucleotide of the CGC codon, has never been observed
as a constitutional mutation in patients or in 61486 ExAC control
samples. On the other hand, p.Arg1809His is present as a somatic
mutation in the COSMIC database in large intestine carcinomas
(1/131 vs. 2/131 for p.Arg1809Cys), which does however not imply
pathogenicity as p.Arg1809His could just be a passenger subsequent
spontaneous deamination at this site. Interestingly, Arg is evolution-
ary conserved down to yeast IRA2 whereas Lys is present at this site
in IRA1. As Arg, His, and Lys all share a similar basic side chain, we
postulate this charge at position 1809 is important for normal func-
tion which may explain why p.Arg1809His has not been observed in
patients so far. We therefore hypothesize that p.Arg1809His is either
not pathogenic or results in a different phenotype.

The present data indicate that p.Arg1809 missense mutations are
associated with a distinct NF1 phenotype of multiple CALM, with
or without skinfold freckling and Lisch nodules, but a signiﬁcantly

reduced frequency of NF1-associated benign and malignant tu-
mors. Multiple (>5) CALMs are usually the ﬁrst sign indicative
of NF1 and present shortly after birth. Up to 90% of the pa-
tients thereafter develop skinfold freckling before the age of 8
years, thereby fulﬁlling the clinical criteria of NF1 [Friedman et al.,
1986a]. Typically, more signs and complications develop thereafter,
but few indicators predict the severity of the disorder over time.
This uncertainty negatively impacts quality of life [Vranceanu et al.,
2013].

The most striking ﬁnding is the paucity of cutaneous, subder-
mal and externally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Cutaneous and
subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas are benign tumors that start growing
during puberty. Typically, adult patients have multiple to thousands
of them. As they cause esthetic and social disability with a signiﬁcant
effect on the quality of life in post-pubertal individuals, the current
ﬁndings are important for a large group of patients.

In addition, summarizing all available evidence so far, no exter-
nally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas were found in 107 individuals
older than 9 years [Nystr¨om et al., 2009; this study; Ekvall et al., 2014;
Pinna et al., 2015; Santoro et al., 2015]. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas are
prone to undergo malignant transformation, with an NF1 patient’s
lifetime risk of developing a MPNST estimated at 5.9%–13% [Evans
et al., 2002; McCaughan et al., 2007]. Importantly, no MPNSTs were
observed in 59 individuals between 19 and 87 years of age [Nystr¨om
et al., 2009; Ekvall et al., 2014; Pinna et al., 2015; Santoro et al.,
2015]. Caution remains needed however, as minor lesions might be
missed on a routine clinical examination. Moreover, full body imag-
ing would be needed to exclude the presence of internal peripheral
nerve sheath tumors.

NF1-related optic gliomas occur in 15%–20% of children and are
most often asymptomatic [Listernick et al., 2007]. Although routine
MRI is not indicated in an asymptomatic child, visual assessment is
recommended as standard of care in NF1 patients, even in younger
children, to detect decreased visual acuity and proptosis, the most
common symptoms caused by optic glioma requiring MRI. The
mean age of diagnosis of a symptomatic optic glioma is 5 years
[Nicolin et al., 2009]. No symptomatic optic pathway glioma (0/153,
with 114/153 ࣙ5 years), including no optic pathway glioma by MRI
in all 42 individuals ࣙ5 years was found (this study and [Pinna
et al., 2015]). A brain lesion was present in four individuals in our
study, including one patient where the physician decided to treat
(right thalamic, histologically conﬁrmed astrocytoma treated with
stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy at the age of 17 years,
due to changes in the tumor perceived on imaging prior to NF1
genetic testing). Collection of greater datasets is needed to further
reﬁne the decreased tumor risk associated with Arg1809 missense
mutations.

No systematic occurrence of any other tumor, except lipomas
(10/136 individuals, this study and [Nystr¨om et al., 2009] has
been associated with missense mutations at p.Arg1809. Absence
of a clear tumor phenotype may indicate that Arg1809 acts differ-
ently compared to truncating NF1 mutations and may be a hypo-
morphic, gain-of-function or dominant-negative acting mutation.
However, p.Arg1809Cys behaves as a loss-of-function mutation in
melanocytes from CALMs as evidenced by the identiﬁcation of 2
mutations in the patient with segmental NF1 presentation, UAB-
RSeNF23, in line with our previous ﬁnding of NF1 acting as a
tumor suppressor in these cells [Maertens et al., 2007; De Schepper
et al., 2008].This ﬁnding questions but does not exclude for other
tissues the often raised suspicion that NF1 missense mutations as-
sociated with a NF-Noonan phenotype may exert a gain of function
or dominant-negative effect. Additional functional studies would
be needed to shed further light on this.

A co-occurrence of p.Arg1809 and vascular abnormalities was
observed, of interest given the known association between RASA1
(p.120-RASGAP; MIM #139150), another guanosine triphosphatase
activating protein with similar RAS-MAPK-downregulating func-
tion as neuroﬁbromin, and abnormal angiogenesis [Revencu et al.,
2008].

Three individuals with the p.Arg1809Cys mutation in this cohort
and 1 patient with both the p.Arg1809Cys and PTPN11 p.Phe285Leu
mutations [Nystr¨om et al., 2009] presented with an Arnold-Chiari
type 1 malformation. While Arnold Chiari type 1 malformation has
been more frequently reported in PTPN11, its association with NF1
is still under discussion [Pl¨umpe N et al., 2010]. The true incidence
of this malformation is only recently being understood with the
increased use of MRI, and the prevalence in the general population
may be as high as 1/1280 according to recent estimates [Meadows
et al., 2000; Boyles et al., 2006]. Therefore, the data presented here
may suggest a possible association between Arnold-Chiari 1 malfor-
mation and the NF1 p.Arg1809Cys mutation.

Pectus abnormalities (pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum) were
signiﬁcantly less frequent in the Arg1809-missense mutation-
positive individuals compared to classic NF1 (P < 0.0001).

Learning disabilities, cognitive impairment and abnormal devel-
opment were frequently reported in this cohort, especially speech
and language delays, AD(H)D, gross and ﬁne motor delays. Signif-
icant learning disabilities or intellectual disability were reported in
8 individuals. As the learning disabilities remain a signiﬁcant con-
cern in this group of patients, we propose to refer to the associated
phenotype as being distinct, rather than mild.

As patients referred for genetic testing were coming from many
different clinics, it was not possible to obtain standardized data on
the extent of the learning disabilities. Therefore, further studies are
needed to systematically investigate problems with speech, language,
learning, and behavior in Arg1809-missense mutation-positive in-
dividuals.

Features/complications belonging to the Noonan-spectrum were
present in signiﬁcant excess (26.2%). Perception of facial and dys-
morphic features is however somewhat subjective, whereas short
stature and PS are objective ﬁndings. Although more than 80% of
NF1 patients have an average height below expected for age, only
5%–7% have true short stature (height more than 3 standard devia-
tions below average) [Friedman et al., 1986b]. The cohorts described
by Huson et al. (1988) and Khosrotehrani et al. (2005) report short
stature in a higher percentage of individuals (15.9%) and therefore,
we used the latter frequency, conservatively, for our comparisons.
Quantitative data on height for age were evaluated rigorously in this
study, taking ethnic background into consideration and only con-
sidering short stature when height was ࣘPC3. Short stature (ࣘPC3)
was present in 35.4%, highly signiﬁcantly more prevalent than in
classic NF1 (P < 0.0001).

PS was also present in excess in p.Arg1809-missense mutation-
positive individuals compared with the classic NF1 cohorts. The
current ﬁnding supports that PS in NF1 might be more frequently
found in patients carrying a non-truncating mutation [Ben-Shachar
et al., 2013], although none of the previous studies had identiﬁed
this recurrent p.Arg1809 missense mutation in their cohort. The as-
sociation of Arg1809 with short stature and PS remained undetected
in the study by Pinna et al., 2015 (short stature in 1/10 individuals
and PS in 0/10) and Santoro et al., 2015 (short stature in 0/15 and
PS in 0/13). However, the power to detect differences in the fre-
quency of speciﬁc complications in this cohort versus classic NF1,
with a signiﬁcance at the 5% level, is lower in a cohort of 23 and 25
individuals: power of 69% to detect the increased frequency of PS
(12.5% in this cohort vs. 1.1% in classic NF1) and power of 60% to
9

detect the increased frequency of short stature (35% in this cohort
vs. 15.9% in classic NF1).

Cohorts of individuals with the NF1 mutations at p.Arg1809,
p.Met992del, and LS share the low frequency of benign and
malignant tumors. Based on our epidemiological data, 86/7,000
mutation-positive unrelated individuals carry a germline mutation
at p.Arg1809 and 55/7,000 at p.Met992del (Messiaen, unpublished).
In addition, as ß2% of individuals fulﬁlling NIH criteria have LS
(Messiaen et al., 2009) and, as only ß38% of reported cases with LS
fulﬁll NIH criteria by the age of 9 years, a larger group of individu-
als with CALMs with or without skinfold freckling exist for whom
identiﬁcation of the aforementioned genetic changes may relieve
the psychosocial burden and anxiety associated with uncertainty
and waiting for tumor symptoms to develop.

Considering complications that can be found in the general pop-
ulation with a frequency of ß1/1,000 (e.g., phaeochromocytoma,
Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, etc.), combining data from
this (n = 39) and previous studies (n = 21) on 60 Arg1809-missense
mutation-positive adults (ࣙ19 year) results in a power estimate of
more than 85% to detect complications as being associated with
this mutation and occurring in at least 5% of Arg1809-positive in-
dividuals. Combining data from this (n = 111) and previous studies
(n = 33) on 143 Arg1809-positive individuals aged ࣙ5 years, we
estimated in post-hoc power calculation that this sample size would
allow detection of complications with a prevalence of at least 3%
with a power of 92%, and of at least 2% with a power of 75%.
Complications that are even rarer would require larger cohorts to
show up as being associated with this mutation. This calls for care-
ful collection of additional genotype and phenotype data as 250
well-characterized, preferably adult patients are needed to identify
complications present with a frequency of only 1%. We therefore
call for an international effort to collect accurate phenotypic data
on these patients.

A limitation of the current study is the heterogeneity of the clini-
cal data, with many clinical NF experts involved, although the same
standardized questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data were
interrogated extensively, ﬁrst through the initial submission of the
questionnaire as part of the clinical testing, followed by a request
to conﬁrm and update the data and to clarify unclear data. This
approach may result in over-reporting of certain signs and symp-
toms compared to classic cohorts of aggregated data that were only
interrogated once.

Therefore, for those symptoms that are statistically signiﬁcantly
less frequent in the Arg1809-missense positive cohort, the ﬁndings
are even more signiﬁcant as information was collected and veri-
ﬁed twice: therefore we do not anticipate underreporting for these
speciﬁc features in our cohort.

On the other hand, we have features that are clearly more frequent
in the Arg1809-missense positive cohort compared with classic NF1
cohorts, especially short stature (35.4%; P < 0.0001) and PS (12.5%;
P < 0.0001). As length for a given age is expressed as a discrete
quantitative measurement there cannot be bias in the resulting data.
Also, the excess of PS in individuals carrying an Arg1809-missense
mutation cannot be attributed to ascertainment bias. It is standard
of care for children to be evaluated with echocardiograms if a heart
murmur is present or suspected. Moreover, the difference in PS
frequency between the Arg1809 cohort and the classic NF1 cohorts
(12.5% vs. 1.1%) is very large.

Missense mutations affecting p.Arg1809 are the second most fre-
quent mutation in the UAB cohort, second only to the 1.4 Mb NF1
type 1 microdeletion. Therefore, the current ﬁndings affect a large
number of individuals. Finding this genotype in an individual or
family will impact counseling and management, thus providing an
10

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 00, No. 0, 1–12, 2015

incentive to perform constitutional NF1 mutation analysis. More-
over, if a substantial deviation from the here described phenotype
is found in an inferred (i.e., a relative of an individual with a proven
p.Arg1809 missense mutation) as well as in a proven p.Arg1809
missense mutation carrier, further genetic investigations should be
pursued. Communicating this information to the patients including
the necessary nuances and detail is best done by genetic counselors
and clinicians specialized in the complexity of NF1. It is important
that clinicians involved in the care of patients with NF1 are aware
of these emerging genotype–phenotype correlations that may alter
surveillance and management.

The current data demonstrate that genotype–phenotype correla-
tions in NF1 exist and may be relevant to management and surveil-
lance of these patients. Therefore a renewed interest in these studies
and close collaboration between NF1 clinicians and molecular ge-
neticists are needed to come to a timely unfolding of additional such
correlations.
