Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most prevalent dominantly inherited genetic diseases
of the nervous system. NF1 encodes a tumor suppressor whose functional loss results in the
development of benign neurofibromas that can progress to malignancy. Neurofibromas are
complex tumors composed of axonal processes, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineurial cells, and
mast cells. Through use of a conditional (cre/lox) allele, we show that loss of NF1 in the Schwann
cell lineage is sufficient to generate tumors. In addition, complete NF1-mediated tumorigenicity
requires both a loss of NF1 in cells destined to become neoplastic as well as heterozygosity in
non-neoplastic cells. The requirement for a permissive haploinsufficient environment to allow
tumorigenesis may have therapeutic implications for NF1 and other familial cancers.

Approximately 1 in 3500 individuals is born with a mutation in the NF1 gene and, because
afflicted individuals can be long-lived, most mutations are retained within the population (1–
3). The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a protein of 2818 amino acids that harbors a
functional Ras-GAP (guanosine triphosphatase activating protein) domain in its central
region (4,5). Neurofibromin is highly conserved among vertebrate species and has a 60%
protein-wide homology with the Drosophila homolog (6).

The plexiform neurofibroma, thought to be embryonic in origin, can physically impede
normal neurologic function. In addition, plexiform neurofibromas undergo transformation
into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, the most common malignancy associated
with NF1 (1–3,7). It is unknown whether neurofibroma formation requires NF1 loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) in a single cell type or in some specific complement of all the cell
types commonly present in these tumors. A feature of NF1, as well as of other familial
cancers, is that all nontumor tissue is heterozygous for the tumor suppressor. It is unknown
whether tumor suppressor heterozygosity contributes to tumor formation or growth.

Chimeric analysis using NF1 homozygous (NF1−/−) embryonic stem cells has demonstrated
that mice can develop tumors that resemble plexiform neurofibroma (8). These studies,
however, did not address the identity of the cell type(s) that undergoes tumor initiation. To
test the hypothesis that NF1 loss in Schwann cells is the genetic bottleneck for neurofibroma
formation, we used a Cre transgene under control of the Krox20 promoter to ablate NF1
function in these cells (9,10). Analysis of the Krox20-cre activity [Web figs. 1 and 2 (11)],

confirms the specificity of the Cre transgene to Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous
system. Among additional cell types that are normally present in neurofibromas, including
neurons, fibroblasts, and mast cells, little or no Cre activity is found. Mice that bear the
Krox20-cre transgene and are heterozygous for the NF1 locus (NF1flox/−; Krox20-cre) were
bred to NF1flox/flox mice (12).

All progeny with the NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre genotype (n = 12) showed classic signs of illness
after 10 to 12 months of age and were necropsied along with control littermates. In all cases,
the peripheral nerves of the NF1flox/−; Krox20-cre mice were enlarged in diameter [Web fig.
3 (11)]. This feature has also been observed in NF1 patients who undergo surgery for
plexiform neurofibromas (13). Histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural
analyses confirmed that the cause of enlarged nerve girth was increased cellularity between
individual axons [Web fig. 3 (11)].

More detailed histological analysis of cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots revealed that
each mouse with this genotype had extensive proliferation of delicate, elongated, bipolar
cells identical to those seen in human neurofibromas (14) (Fig. 1, A to F). Tumor sections
were evaluated immunohistochemically, and all NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre tumors exhibited
S100 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, C and F) and a series of neural crest, Schwann cell,
perineurial fibroblast, and neuronal markers [Web table 1 (11)]. Human neurofibromas are
composed of a mixture of cells that retain a functional NF1 allele and cells that have
undergone LOH (15). Accordingly, DNA analysis of the isolated murine tumor tissues (Fig.
1, G and H) indicates the presence of the recombined NF1flox allele in a subpopulation of
cells in conjunction with cells that retain the intact flox allele. Ultra-structural evaluation of
the tumors revealed abundant collagen and prominent Schwann cell cytoplasmic processes
between axons (Fig. 2, A and B), as well as concentric arrays of perineurial cells around
individual axons (Fig. 2, C and D). We also observed mast cell infiltration into the tumors,
as assessed by morphological, histological, and enzymatic criteria (Fig. 2, E and F). These
findings indicate that Krox20-cre–mediated ablation of NF1 in Schwann cells is sufficient to
initiate neurofibroma formation with 100% penetrance, in association with the presence of
multiple additional cell types that retain NF1 function. The plexiform neurofibromas
observed in NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre mice exhibit every discernible molecular and histological
feature of the human counterpart.

Unlike sporadic forms of cancer, familial cancers are dominantly inherited and are triggered
by the somatic loss of the one remaining functional allele at a tumor suppressor–encoding
locus. To address whether the heterozygous state of NF1 in somatic cells other than the
tumor-initiating Schwann cells plays an active role in neurofibroma formation, we
constructed mice that have intact (wild-type) NF1 function in all cells except for those that
express the Krox20-cre transgene (NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre). We aged and necropsied three
mice of the NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre genotype. The NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre mice did not
exhibit enlarged peripheral nerves. However, microscopic examination revealed evidence of
hyperplastic lesions in the cranial nerves. The frequency of lesions (Fig. 3A), as well as
lesion size and collagen accumulation, was greatly reduced in NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre mice
as compared to NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre mice (Fig. 3B).

We also observed a marked reduction of mast cell infiltration in hyperplastic lesions from
the wild-type background. We compared peripheral nerves from mice of three different
genotypes: NF1+/− mice (containing +/− Schwann cells and +/− mast cells);
NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre mice (containing −/− Schwann cells and +/− mast cells); and
NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre mice (containing −/− Schwann cells and +/+ mast cells). Six-
month-old NF1flox/−;Krox20-cre mice exhibit Schwann cell hyperplasia with substantial
infiltration of mast cells that persist as the lesions progress to frank neurofibromas. In

contrast, the hyperplastic lesions found in the 12- to 16-month NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre mice
and peripheral nerves of 12-month NF1+/− mice had fewer mast cells (Fig. 3C), providing
genetic evidence that the haploinsufficient state of the somatic tissue surrounding NF1
tumors has a functional contribution to tumor formation (initiation or progression).

The notion that tumor formation is a coordinated process in which incipient tumor cells
recruit collaborating cells from the environment has established a firm foothold (16). For a
normal cell to transform into a fully tumorigenic cell, many internal changes must take
place. Among the requirements, it has been acknowledged that cell cycle suppressors must
be shut down, growth factor requirements must be eluded, blood vessel formation must be
induced, and apoptotic signals must be evaded (16). This cell autonomous process not only
reconfigures the nature of the resident tumor cell but also reconfigures that of its cellular
environment (17). The present study identifies a non–cell autonomous role for the
development of tumors in NF1. The onset, growth potential, and multicellular nature of the
NF1−/− neurofibromas is suppressed when the cellular environment retains both functional
NF1 alleles. We have ruled out trivial explanations for the observed difference in tumor
incidence that relate to the potential relative inefficiency of the Cre transgene to ablate two
alleles of the floxed NF1 gene in the flox/flox configuration, versus one allele in the flox/−
configuration. Cultured Schwann cells from newborn (P0) spinal nerves of
NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre mice exhibit a transformed morphology indistinguishable from that
of the NF1−/− cells described previously [Web fig. 4 (11)] (18). Because NF1−/− Schwann
cells have a growth disadvantage as compared with wild-type Schwann cells (18), we can
rule out that the transformed cells may overtake any nontransformed cells in the cultures.
Hence, a majority, if not all, of Schwann cells has undergone loss of NF1 in the context of
two floxed alleles. Indeed, the requirement of a heterozygous NF1 state for plexiform
neurofibroma formation may explain two clinical observations. (i) With extremely rare
exceptions, the plexiform neurofibroma is found only in persons afflicted with NF1 (19). (ii)
Tumors arising within spinal roots in the setting of NF1 are exclusively plexiform
neurofibromas, whereas tumors in a similar location in the setting of NF2 or sporadic forms
are predominantly Schwannomas (20). Finally, as elaborated below, we identify a specific
cellular type that exhibits altered properties in the heterozygous versus wild-type
environment.

The fact that NF1+/− mast cells invade pre-neoplastic nerves and remain present throughout
the development of the tumor is in stark contrast to the absence of NF1+/+ mast cells in the
NF1flox/flox;Krox20-cre hyperplasias that fail to form frank neurofibromas. Previous studies
have described the enhanced proliferative properties of heterozygous mast cells from NF1
patients and from NF1+/− mice (21). Given the breadth of cytokine expression found in
degranulating mast cells, it is tempting to speculate that these cells could play a central role
in the initiation of neurofibroma formation (1). In this scenario, sensitized heterozygous
(NF1+/−) mast cells homing to nullizygous (NF1−/−) NF1 Schwann cells in peripheral
nerves would create a cytokine-rich microenvironment that is apparently permissive for
tumor growth. This effect is presumably confined to heterozygous mast cells interacting
with nullizygous Schwann cells, because in the original NF1 knockout mouse, the
heterozygous Schwann cells in peripheral nerves were unable to attract heterozygous mast
cells.

Our results suggest that it may be possible to prevent or delay tumor formation in NF1 by
designing therapies that neutralize the effects of haploinsufficiency before the onset of
tumorigenesis. Moreover, tumor formation in other familial cancers may merit similar
scrutiny to determine the potential contribution of the heterozygous environment (22).
