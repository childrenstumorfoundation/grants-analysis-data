ABSTRACT:

Mutations in the NF2 gene cause Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), a disorder 
characterized by the development of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas 
in the nervous system. Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF2 gene, modulates 
activity of many essential signaling pathways. Yet despite increasing knowledge of 
merlin function, there are no NF2 drug therapies. In a pilot high-throughput screen 
of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds, we assayed for compounds 
capable of reducing viability of mouse Schwann cells (MSC) with Nf2 inactivation as a 
cellular model for human NF2 schwannomas. AGK2, a SIRT2 (sirtuin 2) inhibitor, was 
identified as a candidate compound. SIRT2 is one of seven mammalian sirtuins that 
are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. We show that merlin-mutant MSC have 
higher expression levels of SIRT2 and lower levels of overall lysine acetylation than 
wild-type control MSC. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 decreases merlin-mutant 
MSC viability in a dose dependent manner without substantially reducing wild-type 
MSC viability. Inhibition of SIRT2 activity in merlin-mutant MSC is accompanied by 
release of lactate dehydrogenase and high mobility group box 1 protein into the 
medium in the absence of significant apoptosis, autophagy, or cell cycle arrest. These 
findings suggest that SIRT2 inhibition triggers necrosis of merlin-mutant MSCs and 
that SIRT2 is a potential NF2 drug target. 

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a benign tumor 
disorder of the nervous system caused by mutations in 
the  NF2  gene  that  encodes  a  tumor  suppressor  called 
schwannomin  or  merlin.  The  hallmark  of  NF2  is  the 
formation  of  bilateral  schwannomas  in  the  vestibular 
branch  of  the  auditory  nerve.  Patients  frequently 
develop additional schwannomas in other cranial, spinal 
and  peripheral  nerves  as  well  as  meningiomas  and 
ependymomas. Common initial symptoms include hearing 
loss,  dizziness  or  imbalance;  however  life-threatening 
compression of the brainstem also occurs [1]. The choices 
for NF2 schwannoma treatments are surgical resection or 
stereotactic radiosurgery. Many schwannomas however are 
inoperable and surgery often causes complete loss of nerve 
function, while radiosurgery carries an increased risk of a 
future secondary malignancy [2]. Currently, a few clinical 
trials of anti-cancer drugs are underway for NF2 [3, 4].  

Molecular studies of merlin’s mechanism of action have 
revealed that merlin regulates signaling from mitogenic, 
adhesion  and  extracellular  matrix  receptors  through 
many essential signaling pathways [5, 6]. However, the 
pleotropic effect of merlin has made it difficult to identify 
the most relevant drug targets.

As  an  alternative  approach  to  drug  discovery, 
we  conducted  an  unbiased  high-throughput  screen  of 
the  library  of  Pharmacologically  Active  Compounds 
(LOPAC)  using  viability  of  merlin-mutant  mouse 
Schwann cells (MSC) as a phenotypic assay to identify 
potential  compounds  and  pathways  relevant  to  NF2 
schwannoma  treatment.  One  compound  identified  in 
the screen was AGK2, a SIRT2 inhibitor. SIRT2 is one 
of  seven  mammalian  sirtuins,  also  known  as  class  III 
HDACs  (histone  deacetylases).  Sirtuins  are  NAD(+) 
dependent  deacetylases,  that  remove  the  acetyl  group 
from the lysine’s epsilon-amine in a multi-step reaction[7, 
8]. SIRT2 is mainly cytoplasmic and its known substrates

(PAR3),  p53,  K-RAS,  histone  H4K16,  forkhead  Box 
O1  and  3a  (FOXO1  and  3a)  and  RIP1  [9-14].  While 
beneficial  effects  of  SIRT2  inhibition  was  shown  in 
neurodegenerative  diseases  such  as  Parkinson’s  and 
Huntington’s disease, the role of SIRT2 in cancer remains 
controversial  [15,  16].  SIRT2  has  been  reported  to 
function as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in 
some human gliomas; however, its function has also been 
reported as essential for survival of C6 glioma cells. Small 
molecule SIRT2 inhibitors have in some cases selectively 
induced tumor cell death [17-21].

Here  we  validate  AGK2  as  a  compound  that 
selectively  reduces  viability  of  merlin-mutant  MSC 
compared  to  normal  MSCs.  Moreover  we  demonstrate 
increased expression levels of SIRT2 in merlin-mutant 
versus normal MSCs that are associated with a general 
reduction in lysine acetylation. Phenotypic mechanism of 
action studies suggests that inhibition of SIRT2 in merlin-
mutant SCs triggers a necrotic pathway. 

RESULTS

Merlin-Mutant MSC Have Higher SIRT2 Levels 
and  Lower  Lysine  Acetylation  Levels  Than 
Control MSC. 

Merlin-mutant  mouse  Schwann  cells  (MSC) 
contain a deletion of exon 2 of the Nf2 gene that replicates 
a  documented  patient  mutation.  Merlin-mutant  MSC 
were  created  by  in  vitro  adeno-Cre  transduction  of 
mouse  Schwann  cells  isolated  from  sciatic  nerves  of 
homozygous Nf2flox2/flox2 mice as previously described [22-
24]. Using this NF2 cell model, we screened the Library 
of  Pharmacologically  Active  Compounds  (LOPAC, 
Sigma-Aldrich)  searching  for  compounds  capable  of 
reducing their viability. One of the initial hits we chose to 
investigate was AGK2, a small molecule SIRT2 inhibitor. 
The sirtuin family of deacetylases has not been examined 
heretofore in NF2. 

To visualize the lysine acetylation patterns in merlin-
mutant MSC and control MSC, we performed a western 
blot using an ε-acetyl-Lysine antibody. Control MSC had 
a higher number of and more intensely acetylated bands 
than merlin-mutant MSC (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 
S1).  Because  the  merlin-mutant  MSC  presented  fewer 
bands, we asked whether SIRT2, the target of AGK2 had 
altered expression levels. Indeed we found that merlin-
mutant MSC expressed SIRT2 at higher levels than control 
MSC  (Fig.  1b).  The  acetyl-lysine  blot  differed  greatly 
around  the  50  kDa  molecular  weight  marker.  Because 
SIRT2 is a recognized acetyl-α-tubulin deacetylase, we 
investigated if any of those bands were α-tubulin. Merlin-
mutant  MSC  have  highly  deacetylated  tubulin  levels 

compared to control MSC (Fig. 1b). We confirmed these 
differences  with  several  independently  derived  merlin-
mutant MSC lines (Fig. 1c). We next immunoblotted for 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (GAPDH) 
because tumor cells have altered metabolism and sirtuins 
can  influence  metabolic  and  energetic  regulation.  We 
found higher levels of GAPDH in merlin-mutant MSC 
compared  to  MSC  consistent  with  higher  glycolytic 
activity in merlin-mutant MSC than controls (Fig. 1c). 
In order to validate the results in our cellular model, we 
measured SIRT2 and acetyl-α-tubulin levels in a human 
NF2 cell line created by immortalization of schwannoma 
cells from a NF2 patient with the E6 and E7 genes of the 
papillomavirus [25]. Similarly, we found higher levels of 
SIRT2 in HEI-193 cells than in control human Schwann 
cells which correlated with lower acetylated tubulin levels 
in HEI-193 compared to control cells (Fig. 1d).

We  localized  SIRT2  in  control  and  mutant  cells 
using immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal 
microscopy. Both cells types expressed the Schwann cell 
marker S100 and control MSC immunoreacted with the 
N-terminal merlin antibody whereas the merlin-mutant 
MSC  did  not.  Both  cell  types  expressed  SIRT2  in  the 
cytosol  and  nuclei,  however,  merlin-mutant  MSC  in 
general had higher levels of fluorescence intensity than 
controls. Control MSC showed significantly higher levels 
of  acetylated  tubulin  compared  to  merlin-mutant  MSC 
and in the latter, the weak immunofluorescence signal for 
acetylated tubulin was mostly perinuclear (Fig. 1e).

Lastly, we examined the expression of other sirtuin 
family members by western blotting. SIRT5 was expressed 
in  control  and  mutant  MSC  at  similar  levels,  whereas 
SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT7 were expressed at higher levels 
in merlin-mutant MSC than MSC (Fig. 1f).

SIRT2  Inhibition  Selectively  Reduces  Merlin-
Mutant  MSC  Viability  in  a  Dose-Dependent 
Manner

To  evaluate  selectivity  of  SIRT2  inhibition  for 
merlin-mutant  MSC  viability,  we  conducted  a  dose 
response  study  of  AGK2  using  CellTiter-Fluor  assay. 
We found that a 24 hour exposure to AGK2 decreased 
merlin-mutant MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner 
with an IC50= 9.0 µM (Fig. 2a). In contrast, AGK2 did 
not decrease control MSC viability as effectively as for 
merlin-mutant cells (Fig. 2b). At 10 µM AGK2, merlin-
mutant cells retained 45.8 ± 0.7 % viability compared to 
control MSC that retained 70.9 ± 1.8 % viability.

Although  AGK2  is  a  highly  selective  SIRT2 
inhibitor, it does minimally inhibit SIRT1 and SIRT3 at 
ten times the SIRT2 IC50 level when tested in vitro [15]. 
To corroborate that SIRT2 was specifically inhibited by 
AGK2 and associated with loss of merlin-mutant MSC 
viability,  we  tested  the  effect  of  an  alternative  SIRT2 

2355

Oncotarget 2013; 4:www.impactjournals.com/oncotargetinhibitor,  AK1.  This  benzylsulfonamide  also  inhibits 
SIRT2 enzymatic activity by targeting the nicotinamide 
binding site but with less potency for SIRT1 and SIRT3 
than AGK2. We found that AK1 decreased merlin-mutant 
MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50= 

26.1 µM (Fig. 2c). AK1 minimally reduced control MSC 
viability which retained 82.8 ± 2.1% viability at 25 µM 
(Fig.  2d).  These  results  suggest  that  pharmacological 
inhibition  of  SIRT2  selectively  reduced  merlin-mutant 
MSC viability.

Proliferation Without Interfering with Cell Cycle 
Progression or DNA Synthesis 

We next assessed the ability of AGK2 to decrease 
cell  viability  for  longer  incubation  times.  We  treated 
merlin-mutant MSC with vehicle or inhibitor and assessed 
the cell number by crystal violet staining at 24, 48 and 
72 hours. We found that at 72 hours AGK2 significantly 
reduced  the  number  of  merlin-mutant  MSC  compared 
to  vehicle  control  (Fig.  3a).  We  also  measured  EdU 
incorporation in AGK2-treated merlin-mutant MSC and 
found that it did not decrease DNA synthesis compared to 
vehicle treated controls (Fig. 3b).

To determine if the decrease in cell number caused 
by AGK2  was  associated  with  inhibition  of  cell  cycle 
progression,  we  performed  flow  cytometry  analysis  of

propidium iodine (PI) labeled cells. We found that AGK2 
did not significantly alter the distribution of diploid cells 
in the cell cycle, although there was a tendency to slightly 
increase the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (Fig. 
3e). To further analyze the effect of AGK2 on cell cycle 
progression, we performed a BrdU/7-AAD assay. There 
was no significant change in the distribution of treated 
and untreated cell populations during the cell cycle after 
24  hours  (Fig.  3f).  These  results  suggest  that  SIRT2 
inhibition  decreased  merlin-mutant  MSC  proliferation 
by mechanisms independent of interfering with cell cycle 
progression.

SIRT2 Inhibition Induces Merlin-Mutant MSC 
Cell Death 

To determine if SIRT2 inhibition reduced merlin-
mutant MSC viability by inducing apoptosis, we tested 
caspase 3/7 activity following AGK2 treatment. We found 
that AGK2 moderately increased caspase 3/7 activity at 10 
µM compared to the positive control, staurosporine, that 
increased caspase 3 and 7 activity to much higher levels in 
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). To further analyze if 
SIRT2 inhibition induced caspase independent apoptosis, 
we studied the effect of AGK2 on merlin-mutant MSC 
membrane asymmetry using the violet ratiometric flow 
cytometry  assay.  We  found  AGK2  only  moderately 
increased apoptosis from 3.5 ± 1.2 % in merlin-mutant 
MSC treated with DMSO to 6.1 ± 2.8 % when treated 
with AGK2. This increase however was not statistically 
significant  (Fig.  4b,c).  These  results  suggest  that  even 
though  AGK2  slightly  induced  apoptosis  it  is  not  the 
main mechanism responsible for the decreased viability 
of merlin-mutant MSC. 

Next,  we  assessed  whether  SIRT2  inhibition 
decreased merlin-mutant MSC viability by inducing cell 
death through necrosis. We measured cytotoxicity with 
a  fluorescence  plate  format  assay  that  uses  a  cyanine 
dye impermeant to live cells that stains DNA from dead 
cells and increases its fluorescence. We found that both, 
AGK2 and AK1, significantly increased the number of 
dead merlin-null MSC in dose-dependent manners (Fig. 
5a,b). To further analyze the mechanism of cell death, 
we measured the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
from  cells  with  damaged  membranes  into  the  medium 
with the CytoTox-ONE homogeneous membrane integrity 
assay. We found that both SIRT2 inhibitors, AGK2 and 
AK1 increased the levels of LDH released to the medium 
in a dose dependent manner. This is typically associated 
with cell necrosis (Fig. 5c,d). We also measured release 
from cells of the necrosis marker high mobility group box 
1 protein (HMGB1) by western blot [26]. We found that 
AGK2 and AK1 induced release of significant amounts 
of  HMGB1  into  the  medium  that  corresponded  with  a 
decrease  in  intracellular  HMGB1  levels  (Fig.  5e).  To 

Oncotarget 2013; 4:www.impactjournals.com/oncotargetfurther characterize merlin-mutant MSC cell death, we 
assessed the induction of autophagy by immunoblotting 
for lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1 Light Chain 
3  B  (LC3B-II).  Cytosolic  LC3B-I  during  autophagy  is 
lipidated by Atg 7 and 3 and is converted in LC3B-II that 
associates with autophagic vesicles [27]. We found that 
although  DMSO  slightly  activates  autophagy,  neither 
AGK2 nor AK1 induced it (Fig. 5f).

These  results  suggest 

inhibition 
decreased  merlin-null  MSC  viability  by  triggering  cell 

that  SIRT2 

death characterized by release of LDH and HMGB1.

MSC compared to cultured control MSC and that SIRT2 
activity  was  essential  for  survival  of  merlin-mutant 
Schwann cells but not wild type MSC. SIRT2 inhibition 
by  AGK2  and  AK1  selectively  decreased  viability  of 
Schwann cells lacking functional merlin. The AGK2 and 
AK1 dose-dependent loss of cell viability correlated with 
a dose-dependent cell death that was further characterized 
as associated with release of the necrotic markers LDH 
and HMGB1 without induction of autophagy, cell cycle 
arrest or significant caspase 3/7 dependent or independent 
apoptosis.

Although  SIRT2  has  been  considered  a  potential 
regulator of cell cycle progression [28-30], we did not

find evidence for that mechanism of action in this study.  
SIRT2 was reported to associate with mitotic structures 
and to increase in abundance and phosphorylation during 
mitosis.  It  has  been  reported  to  prevent  chromosome 
condensation  and  entry  into  M  phase  in  response  to 
mitotic stress. Additionally, overexpression of catalytically 
inactive SIRT2 increased the number of multinucleated 
HeLa cells. However in the absence of stressors, SIRT2 
activity  was  not  required  for  cell  cycle  progression  in 
HeLa and HEK293 cells [31]. In Schwann cells, selective 
inactivation of Sirt2 during early embryogenesis did not 
reduce the number of Schwann cells produced during the 
period of rapid cell proliferation that occurs at post-natal 
days  1-5.  This  supports  the  conclusion  that  cell  cycle 
progression in Schwann cells is independent of SIRT2 
activity  [9]  in  agreement  with  our  finding  that  SIRT2 
inhibition did not decrease merlin-mutant MSC viability 
by arresting cell cycle progression but rather by inducing 
cell necrosis. There is evidence for a role of SIRT2 in 
necrosis. Nie et al. reported that AGK2 treatment of PC12 
cells  decreased  intracellular  ATP  levels  and  increased 
necrosis without affecting autophagy [32]. Additionally, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was shown to activate 
necroptosis  via  deacetylation  of  receptor-interacting 
protein 1 (RIP1) by receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) 
bound SIRT2 allowing the formation of a stable complex 
in L929 and Jurkat T cells [14]. Due to the prominent 
role of cytokines in SC development and repair others 
have  shown  that  while  a  low  concentration  of  TNF-α 
induced SC proliferation, a high concentration of TNF-α 
induced SC growth arrest and apoptosis [33-35]. We have 
not studied TNF-α in merlin-mutant Schwann cells and 
additional studies are needed to identify the pathway by 
which inhibition of SIRT2 activity leads to cell necrosis. 

SIRT2 in Cancer 

Similar  to  our  findings  in  Schwannoma  and 
control  Schwann  cells,  upregulation  of  SIRT2  mRNA 
and  protein  levels  has  been  reported  in  some  cancer 
cells  such  as  primary  acute  myeloid  leukemia  blasts 
compared to control hematopoietic progenitor cells from 
healthy individuals [36]. In glioma cells, however, it has 
been  reported  that  several  human  glioma  samples  had 
reduced SIRT2 mRNA compared to normal brain tissue 
and  that  overexpression  of  SIRT2  decreased  HTB14 
glioma cells colony formation [18]. Notably, inhibition of 
SIRT2 activity decreased C6 glioma cells viability [17]. 
Additionally,  aged  mice  with  inactivation  of  the  Sirt2 
gene by deletion of exons 5-8 developed different types 
of tumors depending on their gender [19]. Treatment of 
C6 glioma cells with 10 µM AGK2 for 24 hours caused 
a 60% loss of viability due to both apoptosis and necrosis 
[17]. Similarly, another SIRT2 inhibitor, compound AC-
93253 showed selectively decreasing viability in several 
human cancer cell lines over their human primary cells 

Oncotarget 2013; 4:www.impactjournals.com/oncotargetcontrols [21]. The panel included cell lines from prostate, 
pancreas, cervical and lung cancer. AC-93253 was also 
selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis 
and necrosis. Discrepancies in the positive and negative 
associations of SIRT2 with tumor development are likely 
due to differences in cell type, developmental activation 
patterns for SIRT2 and substrate preferences [9, 37]. For 
instance histone H4 is a principal substrate for SIRT2 in 
various cell types but not in oligodendrocytes  [11, 38].  

Inhibition of SIRT2 and other Deacetylases

Although  AGK2  and  AK1  selectively  inhibit 
SIRT2,  at  higher  concentrations  they  can  also  inhibit 
SIRT1 and SIRT3 in vitro [15]. Therefore it is possible 
that  at  the  IC50  concentrations  used  in  this  study,  the 
compounds  could  have  also  slightly  decreased  SIRT1 
and  3  activity.  Interestingly,

expressing  Burkitt 
lymphoma  cells  and  Burkitt 
lymphoma xenograft mice with a dual SIRT1 and SIRT2

Oncotarget 2013; 4:www.impactjournals.com/oncotargetinhibitor, cambinol, produced a potent antitumor effect 
[39].  Hence,  there  may  be  value  to  SIRT2  and  SIRT1 
combinatorial  inhibition  in  schwannoma  treatment. 
A  recent  study  showed  that  acetylation  of  K-RAS  at 
lysine104 attenuates its transforming activity in cancer 
cells and both SIRT2 and HDAC6 deacetylate K-RAS 
[12]. Moreover, α-tubulin acetylation and cortactin are 
regulated by SIRT2 and HDAC6 [10, 40, 41]. Due to the 
increasing interest of HDAC inhibitors in cancer, a new 
pan-HDAC inhibitor AR42 was tested on merlin mutant 
schwannoma and meningioma cells. Both in vitro and in 
vivo treatment showed a selective anti-proliferative effect 
on schwannoma and meningioma cells warranting further 
clinical evaluation for NF2 related tumors [42-44]. AR42, 
similar  to  other  HDAC  inhibitors  also  decreased  Akt 
phosphorylation, a pathway upregulated in many cancers 
and  NF2.  Chen  et  al.  have  shown  that  AR42  targets 
HDAC1 and HDAC6 by disrupting their HDAC-protein 
phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes, which leads to increased 
PP1-Akt  association,  and  facilitates  PP1-mediated 
dephosphorylation of Akt [45]. Therefore combinatorial 
inhibition of SIRT2 and HDAC6 could be evaluated when 
considering modulation of acetylation signaling for NF2 
treatment.

We speculate that SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition 
may  have  some  therapeutic  value  for  NF2-associated 
schwannomas by promoting necrosis. However, additional 
research is needed to understand the relationship between 
merlin and SIRT2 in normal Schwann cells and the effect 
of  merlin  inactivation  on  protein  acetylation  and  cell 
survival.

their  corresponding  secondary  antibodies  at  1:20,000. 
Quantification of western blots was done by densitometry 
using NIH ImageJ software. 

Immunofluorescence

Control  and  merlin-mutant  MSC  were  plated  on 
coated  German  glass  coverslips  (200  µg/ml  PLL  and 
10  µg/ml  Laminin)  and  immunostained  as  previously 
described  [24].  Images  were  acquired  using  a  Zeiss 
LSM710 Confocal microscope with 3 spectral detection 
channels, 5 laser lines - 458, 488, 514,543 & 633 nm, FL 
filter set 49 DAPI, EX G365, FL filter set 43 CY 3, FL 
filter set 38 Endow GFP, all shift free, EC Plan-Neofluar 
40x/1.3  DIC  WD=0.21  M27  objective  lens,  with  the 
ZEN2009 software. Fluorescence signals were acquired 
on separate channels with identical parameters for each 
labeled protein from a single plane. Fluorescence intensity 
of the green channel was done using Volocity software. 
Pictures were processed with the ZEN2011 software in the 
same manner.

Cell Viability Assay

Viability  of  dose-response  assays  was  assessed 
with  the  CellTiter-Fluor  cell  viability  assay  (Promega) 
following  manufacturer’s  specifications.  Normal  MSC 
and merlin-mutant MSC were seeded at 5,000 cells/well 
in 20 µl of phenol-red free growth medium in 384-well 
plates (black with clear bottom, CellBIND-Corning) and 
centrifuged 1 min at 500 rpm. Cultures were incubated at 
37ºC, 7% CO2 until attachment (2.5–3.5 hours), then 5 
µl of compound/vehicle solution was added to each well. 
Plates were quick spun again and returned to the incubator 
for 24 hours. Fluorescence was read with a Synergy H1 
Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Proliferation Assays

For  the  72  hours  cell  proliferation  study,  cell 
numbers were assessed with the Crystal Violet Assay as 
previously described [46]. Equal number of merlin-mutant 
MSC were seeded in 24-well plates and cell number was 
evaluated at 0; 24; 48 and 72 hour time points. Absorbance 
at  595  nm  was  measured  with  a  µQuant  plate  reader 
(BioTek).

Rate of DNA synthesis was evaluated at 24 hours 
with  the  Click-iT  EdU  Microplate  Assay  (Invitrogen/ 
Life Technologies) as previously described [23]. Oregon 
green-488 and DAPI fluorescence was measured with a 
Synergy H1 hybrid plate reader.

Cell Cycle Analysis

The  cell  cycle  was  analyzed  by  flow  cytometry 
with propidium iodine (PI) staining and BrdU/7AAD. PI 
staining was performed on ethanol fixed cells using PI/
RNase solution from Beckton-Dickinson and studied on 
a BD Canto-II flow cytometer. Histograms were analyzed 
with  ModFit  LT  software  (Verity  Software  House, 
Topsham,  ME).  For  each  sample,  10,000  events  were 
collected and the diploid population was distributed across 
G0/G1, S and G2/M phases. 

The  BrdU/7AAD  assay  kit  was  purchased  from 
Beckton-Dickinson. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 
and  treated  overnight  with  inhibitor/vehicle.  On  the 
next day, 10 µM BrdU was added to the cultures for 3 
hours, cells were harvested, fixed and analyzed following 
manufacturer’s  instruction.  The  BD  Canto-II  flow 
cytometer with the BD FACSDiva™ 6.1.3 software was 
use  for  acquisition  and  Kaluza  1.2  (Beckman  Coulter) 
software for data analysis.

Apoptosis Assays

For  caspases  dependent  apoptosis  the  caspase 
activity  was  assessed  by  the  Apo-ONE  homogeneous 
Caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) following manufacturer’s 
specifications. For caspases dependent and/or independent 
apoptosis the membrane asymmetry was measured with 
the Violet Ratiometric Membrane Asymmetry Probe/Dead 
Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Both 
assay were previously described [23].

Cytotoxicity Assays

Cytotoxicity  was  assayed  in  a  384  well  plate 
format  with  5,000  cells/well  after  24  hours  incubation 
with the inhibitors/vehicle with the CellTox Green assay 
(Promega),  following  the  express,  no-step  addition  at 
seeding  method  described  by  the  manufacturer.  Cells 
treated with 27 µg/ml digitonin were considered 100% 
cytotoxicity control.  Fluorescence (Ex= 510nm/Em= 532 
nm) was measured on a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader. 

LDH Release Assay

LDH  released  into  the  culture  medium  was 
measured  with  the  CytoTox-ONE  assay  (Promega).  
Merllin-null  MSC  were  seeded  at  4,000  cell/well  in 

2362

Oncotarget 2013; 4:www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget384 well plates and were treated on the next day with 
increasing  doses  of  inhibitor/vehicle  and  incubated  for 
4 hours. Positive 100% cytotoxicity control was 27 µg/
ml digitonin. Plate and assay reagent were equilibrated to 
room temperature for 25 min and after addition of 25 µl of 
assay reagent, the plate is incubated at room temperature 
in the Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader. No stop solution 
was used. Fluorescence (Ex=560 nm/Em= 590nm) was 
measured 5 min after the first column received reagent.  

HMGB1 Release Assessment

Equal  number  of  merlin-null  MSC  per  well  in 
CellBIND 6-well plates were cultured overnight. On the 
next day the medium was replaced with 2 ml treatment 
medium containing SIRT2 inhibitors/vehicle in duplicate 
wells and incubated for 6 hours at 37ºC, 7% CO2. Then 
working on ice, media from duplicates were pooled and 
transferred to cold 15 ml conical tubes, centrifuged for 
5 min at 800g, 4 ºC. The supernatant (~4ml) was syringe 
filtered with 0.45 µm filter (Fisher), transferred to cold 7 ml 
9K MWCO Pierce concentrators (Thermo Scientific) and 
centrifuged for 30 min at 4,000g, 4 ºC. From 120 to 150 
µl of concentrated proteins were obtained and prepared for 
SDS-PAGE. When media was removed from cultures, the 
plates were washed once with ice cold PBS and cell were 
lysed with the modified RIPA buffer mentioned above; 
protein concentration was measured with the DC assay 
(BioRad).  Equal volume of concentrated proteins from 
medium and 10 µg of protein of cell lysates were analyzed 
by western blotting for HMGB1.

Statistical Analysis

GraphPad  Prism  version  5.0 

for  Windows 
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical 
analysis  and  graph  generation. AGK-2  and AK1  dose-
response  experiments  were  analyzed  by  non-linear 
regression  (four  parameters).    Experimental  data  from 
three independent experiments were statistically analyzed 
by one or two-way ANOVA with post-tests, as indicated 
for each experiment.
