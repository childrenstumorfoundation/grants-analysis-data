Abstract Dynamic interactions between tumorigenic cells
and surrounding cells, including immunomodulatory hema-
topoietic cells, can dictate tumor initiation, progression, and
transformation. Hematopoietic-stromal interactions under-
pin the plexiform neurofibroma, a debilitating tumor arising
in individuals afflicted with Neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1), a common genetic disorder resulting from mutations
in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. At the tissue level,
plexiform neurofibromas demonstrate a complex microen-
vironment composed of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineu-
ral cells, mast cells, secreted collagen, and blood vessels. At
the cellular level, specific interactions between these cells
engender tumor initiation and progression. In this microen-
vironment hypothesis, tumorigenic Schwann cells secrete

pathological concentrations of stem cell factor, which recruit
c-kit expressing mast cells. In turn, activated mast cells
release inflammatory effectors stimulating the tumorigenic
Schwann cells and their supporting fibroblasts and blood
vessels, thus promoting tumor expansion in a feed-forward
loop. Bone marrow transplantation experiments in plexi-
form neurofibroma mouse models have shown that tumori-
genesis requires Nf1 haploinsufficiency in the hematopoietic
compartment, suggesting that tumor microenvironments can
depend on intricate interactions at both cellular and genetic
levels. Overall, our continued understanding of critical
tumor-stromal interactions will illuminate novel therapeutic
targets, as shown by the first-ever successful medical treat-
ment of a plexiform neurofibroma by targeted inhibition of
the stem cell factor/c-kit axis.

Also known as von Recklinghausen’s disease, Neurofibro-
matosis type 1 (NF1) is a pandemic genetic disorder afflict-
ing about 1 in 3,000 persons worldwide [1]. NF1 occurs as
consequences of mutations of NF1 tumor suppressor gene
on the long arm of chromosome 17, a gene encoding neuro-
fibromin [2]. Neurofibromin functions as a Ras GTPase
activating protein (Ras-GAP), which accelerate the hydro-
lysis of active GTP-bound Ras to inactive GDP-bound Ras
[3, 4]. NF1 is highly conserved across species, especially in
the functionally critical GAP-related domain [4, 5].

Although disease penetrance is complete, specific mani-
festations can vary widely from patient to patient. Patients
are predisposed to both malignant and non-malignant con-
ditions, such as cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neuro-
fibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs), myeloid leukemia, vascular pathologies, and
soft tissue malformation [6, 7]. Approximately 30 % of

308

individuals with NF1 suffer from plexiform neurofibromas,
a tumor suspected to arise during gestation which can be an
early source of disfigurement, disability, and lethality [8].
Intriguingly, plexiform neurofibromas demonstrate an intri-
cate microenvironment composed of irregularly growing
Schwann cells, large numbers of degranulating mast cells,
perineural cells, collagen-secreting fibroblasts, and blood
vessels.

Studies in other cancer models have demonstrated that
tumorigenic cells and their inflammatory microenvironment
affect tumor cell growth, transformation, and metastasis [9].
Although cancers frequently originate secondary to activa-
tion of oncogenes or alternatively as a loss of tumor sup-
pressor genes in proliferating cells,
it has become
increasingly evident that a single mutagenic event is rarely
sufficient for oncogenesis [10]. In a range of murine tumor
models including breast, ovarian [11], pancreatic [12], and
skin models [13], inflammatory cells play critical roles in
maintaining the microenvironment that supports tumor gen-
esis, progression, and transformation.

Microenvironments consist of various cell types, cyto-
kines, growth factors, and components of the extracellular
matrix. Importantly, the microenvironment, as a dynamic
entity, differs in cellular and molecular specificity according
to both tumor type and disease stage. For example, early
cues from nascent tumor cells can recruit hematopoietic
cells which secrete factors to promote local mitogenesis as
well as the recruitment of additional immunomodulators.
Further secretion of secreted cytokines and growth factors
not only remodels the extracellular matrix and the vascula-
ture, but also may provide the specific signals permitting
cellular transformation and metastasis.

Mast cells are granular, tissue-resident immune effector
cells derived from early myeloid progenitor cells in hema-
topoietic tissue [14]. Upon activation of the high-afinity IgE
receptor (Fc RI) and/or the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase,
mast cells release inflammatory mediators including hista-
mine, serotonin, proteoglycans, and leukotrienes [15]. In
various disease models, mast cells can both positively and
negatively regulate inflammation [16, 17]. In NF1-
associated plexiform neurofibromas, inflammatory mast
cells not only pervade tumor tissue and promote cellular
growth [18–25], but they appear to be required for tumori-
genesis. As support, hematopoietic ablation of the gene
encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit (a key regulator
of mast cell generation and bioactivity) prevents tumorigen-
esis in a plexiform neurofibroma murine model [25]. Fur-
thermore, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec©), an inhibitor of c-
kit and other receptor tyrosine kinases, successfully reduced
a highly morbid plexiform neurofibroma in a pediatric pa-
tient with NF1 [25].

The presence of mast cells in tumor tissue of neurofibro-
mas was initially reported by Greggio in 1911 [26].

Independent groups later reported the existence of mast cells
within peripheral nerve sheaths, nerve sheath tumors, and
NF1-associated neurofibromas [27–31]. Further histological
analyses have shown significant increases of mast cell num-
ber in only the neurofibroma tissue, as compared to sur-
rounding tissue [32]. Based on these observations and his
own clinical observations, Vincent Riccardi hypothesized
that mast cells might directly modulate neurofibroma tissue
[33], although histamine-release inhibitors, while effective
at symptom control, ultimately did not affect neurofibroma
progression [34, 35].

Mouse models of plexiform neurofibroma formation
have illuminated cellular and molecular interactions under-
pinning the tumor microenvironment while providing new
insight into targeted therapeutic strategies. Zhu et al. created
the first successful mouse model mimicking human neuro-
fibroma genesis [18]. This mouse carries Cre recombinase
placed under control of the Krox20 promoter (Krox20cre), a
promoter element preferentially expressed in a subset of
Schwann cells. Surprisingly, Krox20cre mice crossed into
Nf1flox/flox mice (Krox20creNf1flox/flox), despite Nf1-deficient
Schwann cells, are essentially healthy. Zhu et al. then
showed that the presence of a constitutively null Nf1 allele
(Krox20creNf1flox/−
) successfully engenders tumorigenesis
along the dorsal root ganglion. Histologic analyses demon-
strated similarity between the murine tumors and human
plexiform neurofibromas. Thus, plexiform neurofibroma
formation in this model requires that a subset of Schwann
cells are Nf1 nullizygous while surrounding cells of the
putative microenvironment, such as fibroblasts, endothelia,
and mast cells, are Nf1 heterozygous.

Bone marrow transplantation experiments in this mouse
model demonstrated that neurofibroma formation hinges on
Nf1 haploinsufficient and c-kit-dependent bone marrow. To
accomplish these experiments, Yang et al crossed Nf1+/−
mice with mice carrying two distinct W mutations, a muta-
tion which compromises c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase ac-
tivity and inhibits mast cell production and bioactivity [36].
Bone marrow from wild-type, Nf1+/−
, Nf1+/−;W41/W41 or
Nf1+/−;Wv/Wv mice were transplanted into Nf1flox/flox;
Krox20cre mice. Recipients of either WT or W mutated bone
marrow did not develop tumors, while recipients of Nf1+/−
bone marrow formed tumors comparable to those found in
Krox20creNf1flox/−
mice. Conversely, transplantation of WT
bone marrow into Krox20creNf1flox/−
mice prevented tumor
formation. Therefore, in this mouse model, the neurofibro-
ma microenvironment genetically requires Nf1 nullizygous
Schwann cells and Nf1+/−

, c-kit-dependent bone marrow.

Various biochemical studies have helped delineate the
hypothetical mechanisms by which Nf1+/−
mast cells engen-
der neurofibroma genesis. Nf1−/−
Schwann cells secrete
high levels of SCF, driving the generation and recruitment
of mast cells [20, 37]. Specifically, media conditioned by

Tumor Microenvironment

Nf1−/−
Schwann cells attracted Nf1+/−
mast cells at twice the
rate of WT mast cells. These Nf1+/−
mast cells, in turn, can
secrete inflammatory cytokines and growth factors which
promote the growth of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and en-
dothelial cells [20, 38–40]. Moreover, SCF-stimulated Nf1+/−
mast cells, as compared to WT mast cells, proliferate more
quickly, demonstrate enhanced survival, and secrete greater
concentrations of inflammatory cytokines [38, 41–43]. In a
subsequent study, SCF-stimulated Nf1+/−
mast cells promoted
fibroblast growth and collagen deposition [38], key cellular
components of human neurofibromas [44].

These mechanistic insights propelled investigation into
pharmacological inhibition of c-kit as a method to reduce
and/or inhibit plexiform neurofibromas. Imatinib mesylate
binds and inhibits the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase, as well
as c-abl, PDGF-β, TGF-β, and perhaps other RTKs [45].
Indeed, imatinib treatment of adult Krox20creNf1flox/−
mice
reduced neurofibroma volume and metabolism approximately
50 % as compared to placebo-treated controls. Nerve sheath
samples from these mice showed restoration of morphology to
Schwann cells and the absence of mast cells. Furthermore,
imatinib treatment of a pediatric index patient with a debili-
tating neurofibroma reduced tumor volume 70 % while miti-
gating symptoms of airway and nerve compression [25].

Collectively, these genetic and pharmacological data ar-
gue that Nf1-deficient Schwann cells recruit and activate
marrow-derived mast cells, which critically modulate tumor
genesis and growth. While data from certain mouse models
suggest that tumor formation requires Nf1+/−
mast cells,
other models using developmentally earlier and more wide-
spread glial cell deletions have not shown this requirement
for Nf1+/−
mast cells [46]. Regardless, all mouse models to
date have shown the pervasive presence of degranulating
mast cells within the tumor tissue.

The tumor microenvironment is complex and dynamic,
and varies depending on the type of tumor or cancer. Here,
we have summarized historical and current evidence regard-
ing the inflammatory microenvironment of the plexiform
neurofibroma. SCF-recruited mast cells secrete multiple
key growth factors that modulate the behavior of the neuro-
fibroma stroma, and these mechanistic insights have led to a
promising therapeutic strategy. Further studies of the cellu-
lar/molecular interactions between tumor, hematopoietic,
and stromal cells in the neurofibroma microenvironment
will undoubtedly unravel more clues in the search for tar-
geted therapeutic interventions.
