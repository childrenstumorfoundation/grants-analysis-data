Abstract

Purpose: The growth and survival of neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2)–deﬁcient cells are enhanced by the
activation of multiple signaling pathways including ErbBs/IGF-1R/Met, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk1/2.
The chaperone protein HSP90 is essential for the stabilization of these signaling molecules. The aim of the
study was to characterize the effect of HSP90 inhibition in various NF2-deﬁcient models.

Experimental Design: We tested efﬁcacy of the small-molecule NXD30001, which has been shown to be
a potent HSP90 inhibitor. The antiproliferative activity of NXD30001 was tested in NF2-deﬁcient cell lines
and in human primary schwannoma and meningioma cultures in vitro. The antitumor efﬁcacy of HSP90
inhibition in vivo was veriﬁed in two allograft models and in one NF2 transgenic model. The underlying
molecular alteration was further characterized by a global transcriptome approach.

Results: NXD30001 induced degradation of client proteins in and suppressed proliferation of NF2-
deﬁcient cells. Differential expression analysis identiﬁed subsets of genes implicated in cell proliferation, cell
survival, vascularization, and Schwann cell differentiation whose expression was altered by NXD30001
treatment. The results showed that NXD30001 in NF2-deﬁcient schwannoma suppressed multiple path-
ways necessary for tumorigenesis.

Conclusions: HSP90 inhibition showing signiﬁcant antitumor activity against NF2-related tumor
cells in vitro and in vivo represents a promising option for novel NF2 therapies. Clin Cancer Res; 19(14);

Introduction

Vestibular schwannomas account for approximately 5%
to 10% of all tumors inside the skull (1); about 1 out of
every 100,000 individuals per year develops a vestibular
schwannomas (2). Conventional treatment of this benign
tumor includes surgical removal and radiotherapy but to
date no validated chemotherapy is available due to poor
response to tested interventions (3). Both sporadic and
familial forms of vestibular schwannomas lack expression

of a functional neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) protein,
merlin/schwannomin (4, 5). Although sporadic vestibular
schwannomas occur in later stages of life, the hallmark of
familial NF2 is the development of early-onset, bilateral
vestibular schwannomas, often associated with other cra-
nial and spinal nerves schwannomas, meningiomas, and
ependymomas that frequently requires repeated invasive
surgeries. Hence, less invasive chemotherapy will be highly
beneﬁcial to the patients with NF2 for tumor control and
prevention.

Merlin is a unique member of the ezrin–radixin–moesin
gene family with tumor-suppressing activities (6). Its over-
expression was shown to decrease cell growth concomitant-
ly with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (7, 8), whereas
its depletion by antisense oligonucleotides resulted in
increased cell proliferation (9). Consistently, mice hetero-
zygous for Nf2 inactivation (10), homozygous for tissue-
speciﬁc Nf2 inactivation (11), and transgenic for expression
of a human dominant-negative NF2 mutant (12) developed
a range of tumors. Merlin is involved in cellular function by
providing the link between the actin cytoskeleton and
multiple membrane-associated proteins, which are essen-
tial for processing extracellular signals, cell adhesion, and
cytoskeletal architecture (reviewed in refs. 13, 14). Various
biologic pathways were suggested for merlin’s involvement
in cell proliferation control, including negatively regulation

Translational Relevance

For sporadic neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2)–deﬁcient
vestibular schwannoma, surgical removal is both an
effective and sufﬁcient intervention in most cases. How-
ever, patients with NF2 have high risks of developing
cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerve schwannoma and
meningioma at a younger age, the majority of whom
present with hearing loss and deafness. Moreover, a
signiﬁcant proportion of meningiomas is inoperable.
Therefore, development of effective chemotherapy
would be most beneﬁcial for overall NF2 tumor preven-
tion. HSP90 inhibitors have acquired signiﬁcant impor-
tance in the ﬁeld of cancer chemotherapy in recent years.
In particular, the response of ERBB2 (HER2)-positive
breast cancer has offered promise for the use of HSP90
inhibitors as a novel therapeutic alternative, a strategy
that is currently in clinical trials. Given their partial
dependence on ErbB signaling, NF2-related tumors are
readily amenable with this strategy.

of Rac pathway necessary for Ras transformation (15), and
contact inhibition of growth through interaction with
CD44 (16). Recently, merlin’s translocation into the nucle-
us was shown to suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting the
nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 (DCAF1) implicated in
DNA replication and cell-cycle progression (17).

Multiple links between merlin and its interacting proteins
suggested the activation of various signaling pathways in
NF2-related tumors, which present a challenge for devel-
oping targeted therapeutics for NF2. HSP90 is a ubiquitous
molecular chaperone that is responsible for maintaining a
subset of proteins involved in cell proliferation and trans-
formation (18). HSP90 inhibition induces proteasomal
degradation of its client proteins, providing an attractive
therapeutic strategy that can simultaneously suppress mul-
tiple signaling pathways. HSP90 is often found overex-
pressed in malignant tumors, and its elevated level was
shown to correlate with poor survival among patients (19).
A study showed that the HSP90 complexes in tumor cells
possess greater afﬁnity to an HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG,
thereby promising selectivity for targeting tumor cells over
normal cells (20). There is single report suggesting the
efﬁcacy of HSP90 inhibition in NF2 (21). Many known
client proteins of HSP90 were found to be coactivated in
human NF2-related tumors, such as ERBBs, AKT, and MET
(refs. 22, 23; and our unpublished observations). Studies
also showed the role of platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR) and integrin–FAK pathways in the
growth of schwannoma (24, 25). Accordingly, we hypoth-
esize that targeting HSP90 will be efﬁcacious for NF2
therapeutics.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of HSP90
inhibition in NF2-deﬁcient cells in cell culture systems
(hereafter referred to as "in vitro") and in mouse allograft
and in a genetically modiﬁed NF2 mouse model ("in vivo").

HSP90 Inhibition for NF2

The novel small-molecule inhibitor series pochonin and
pochoximes, developed on the radicicol scaffold, were
shown to be highly potent and speciﬁc inhibitors of HSP90
with antiproliferative activity (26, 27). One of the lead
compounds NXD30001 (pochoximeA) penetrated the
blood–brain and blood–spinal cord barriers and accumu-
lated in nervous tissues (28), a pre-requisite for treating
tumors in the central/peripheral nervous system including
some NF2-related tumors, such as ependymomas. To fur-
ther characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms of
action, we used the next-generation sequencing (NGS)
approach for assessing the global abundance of transcripts.
Treatment of NF2-deﬁcient cells with NXD30001 in vitro
resulted in the depletion of multiple signaling molecules
implicated in NF2. Concomitantly, in vivo administration of
NXD30001 reduced growth of NF2-deﬁcient tumors, and
further gene expression analysis identiﬁed multiple biologic
pathways that may contribute the efﬁcacy of HSP90 inhi-
bition against NF2-related tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents

The structure of NXD30001 and its formulation have
been described elsewhere (27). Details are given in Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods.

Cell lines and primary cultures

 / 

Mouse Nf2

embryonic Schwann cells, ESF-FC1801,
and mouse schwannoma cells expressing the human Sch-
D(39–121) mutant, 08031-9, were derived in our labo-
ratory. An immortalized human schwannoma cells
HEI193 was a gift from Dr. Lim (House Research Institute,
Los Angeles, CA). The human schwannoma and menin-
gioma and the mouse Schwann cell (mSC) primary cul-
tures were freshly prepared and used before exceeding
5 passages. Details are given in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Cell viability and proliferation assay

MTS-based monolayer cell proliferation assay (Promega)
and soft agar clonogenic assay were used to test cell viability
and proliferation at 72 hours and at 3 weeks of drug
administration in vitro, respectively. The drug concentration
that inhibits cell growth by 50% (GI50) was determined
using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Details are given in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Allograft models and antitumor efﬁcacy assay

All animal experiments were carried out in strict adher-
ence to the NIH guidance in the U.S. Public Health Service
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The ESC-FC1801 cells and the transplantable schwannoma
homogenate, 08031-9, were grafted subcutaneously in
nude and in FVB/N syngenic mice, respectively. Mice were
subjected to intraperitoneal injection of NXD30001 at 100
mg/kg/d, 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Details are given in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Pharmacokinetic analysis

The concentration of NXD30001 in the plasma and
grafted tumors was measured following single dose and
repeated dose administration. The assay was conducted at
Cerep Inc.. Details are given in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Morphometric analysis of Schwann cell tumorlets in
NF2 transgenic mice

F1 mice of NF2 transgenic mice TgP0-Sch-D(39–121)-27,
5 weeks of age, were subjected to oral administration of 17-
DMAG (Alvespimycin) at 10 mg/kg/d or 20 mg/kg/d, 3 days
a week for 8 weeks. The development of Schwann cell
tumorlets in the spinal nerve roots was histopathologically
scored at the endpoint, and was compared between drug-
treated and vehicle-treated mice. Details are given in Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, then sub-
jected for TaqMan gene expression assay using the 7500
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The quan-
tiﬁcation was expressed relative to freshly dissected
mouse sciatic nerve. Details are given in Supplementary
Materials.

Western blotting

Cultured cells (5  105) and pulverized frozen tumor
samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer and the total proteins were extracted, separated, and
transferred using standard procedures. Antibodies used for
Western blotting are given in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry,
TUNEL, and BrdUrd staining

For the detection of S100b, cells were grown on cover
glass, ﬁxed, and stained using anti-S100b antibody and
Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody. The apoptotic
cells were ﬁxed and labeled using DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL System (Promega). The cells undergoing DNA rep-
lication were detected using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
Staining Kit (Invitrogen). For detection of vascularization,
parafﬁn sections of grafted tumors were subjected for plate-
let/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) immuno-
histochemistry followed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. All
images were acquired using the AxioImager.M1 microscope
(Carl Zeiss). Details are given in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Cell-cycle analysis

The distribution of cells in different phases of cell cycle
was measured by ﬂow cytometry. The ESC-FC1801 cells
(1  106/10-mm dish) were treated with NXD30001 for
0, 24, 48, and 72 hours, then ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, and
incubated in PBS-T containing 10 mg/mL propidium iodide
and 100 mg/mL RNase for 1 hour. The cells were analyzed on
the FACSAria II platform (BD Bioscience).

Mutation analysis of NF2-related human schwannomas
and meningiomas

NF2 mutations were screened on the genomic DNA
isolated from patient-derived schwannoma and meningio-
ma by direct sequencing of 17 exons and the adjacent splice
sites (Supplementary Table S1). LOH was determined by
SALSA Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Ampliﬁcation
(MLPA) kit for NF2 (#P044-B1, MRC-Holland). The auto-
mated sequencing and the MLPA analysis were conducted at
Laragene Inc.

Transcriptome analysis by high-throughput mRNA
sequencing
Total RNA from matched ESC-FC1801 cultured cells and
allograft tumors (NXD30001 treated and untreated; n ¼ 1)
was used for global sequencing. The expression of 35,604
gene loci in the mouse genome was reported by Cufﬂinks in
the unit of "fragments per kilobase of exon per million
fragments mapped.". The data have been submitted to Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number
GSE40187. Differentially expressed genes were subjected
to pathway analysis using MetaCore (Thomson Reuters).
Details are given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Statistical analysis

Quantitative data are presented as mean  SD when
applicable. Statistical analysis was carried out using two-
tailed unpaired t test on GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. For the
transcriptome analysis, genes were considered differentially
expressed by the Cufﬂinks software when the false discovery
rate (FDR) corrected P value after Benjamini–Hochberg
correction for multiple testing was less than 0.05.

Results
Elevated HSP90 expression in NF2-related human
schwannomas

We previously conducted an RNA expression study using
microarrays comparing human schwannomas from patients
with NF2 with human saphenous nerves from normal
individuals (Manent, manuscript in preparation). We found
that the expression of HSP90AA and HSP90AB (encoding
HSP90) was elevated in schwannoma when compared with
normal nerves (Fig. 1A): HSP90AA probes 1 and 2 were
upregulated 2.7- and 2.1-folds, respectively. The HSP90AA
probe 4 and the HSP90AB probe 4 were also increased in the
schwannoma samples. These results indicated an increased
requirement of HSP90 in NF2-related schwannomas.

Growth inhibition and client protein degradation by
NXD30001 in NF2-deﬁcient cells in vitro

Two NF2-deﬁcient cell models were used in this study:
mouse embryonic Schwann cells ESC-FC1801 lacking Nf2
exon 2, and mouse schwannoma cells 08031-9 expressing a
human Sch-D(39–121) dominant-negative mutant of NF2.
The expression of the Schwann cell marker S100b was
positive in more than 99% of the 08031-9 cells, comparable
with the mSC primary culture, but was found to be low in

HSP90 Inhibition for NF2

gene expression in the human
schwannoma. Expression of
HSP90AA and HSP90AB (each
with 4 different probe sets) in
NF2-related schwannoma (n ¼ 9)
were compared with that in human
Schwann cells of saphenous

3 HSP90AA and 1 HSP90AB
probes were statistically different
from normal (shown in boxes;

the ESC-FC1801 cells (Fig. 1B). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
conﬁrmed the lower S100b expression in ESC-FC1801,
whereas p75Ngfr was higher in ESC-FC1801 than that in
08031-9 (Fig. 1C). In human vestibular schwannoma
(hVS), expression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 was upregulated
compared with that in normal nerves, whereas EGF receptor
(EGFR) was predominant in the immortalized schwan-
noma cells HEI193, which lacked ERBB3 (Fig. 1D, top).
Consistent with their neuregulin dependency, ESC-FC1801
and 08031-9 expressed high levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 but
lacked Egfr (Fig. 1D, bottom), showing similar expression
pattern to hVS.

HSP90 inhibition by NXD30001 effectively inhibited the
growth of the NF2-deﬁcient cells at low nanomolar con-
centration after 72 hours exposure in vitro (Fig. 2A). ESC-
FC1801 was 10-fold more sensitive to the drug compared
with the normal mSC, signifying the selectivity of the drug
for the Schwann cells lacking NF2. NXD30001 at 100 nmol/
L and 1,000 nmol/L induced nuclear DNA fragmentation, a

 / 

hallmark of apoptosis, in a small percentage of the cells
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1): Nf2
Schwann cells,
ESC-FC1801, were more sensitive to apoptosis than NF2-
deﬁcient schwannoma cells, HEI193 and 08031-9, but less
sensitive than normal mSC. No apoptotic cell was observed
in the patient-derived schwannoma primary cultures (data
not shown). The results indicated that NF2-deﬁcient cells
acquired resistance to apoptosis, and the primary effect of
HSP90 inhibition in the schwannoma cells was cytostatic
rather than cytotoxic.

Long-term effect of NXD30001 in the Nf2-deﬁcient cells in
vitro was evaluated by soft agar clonogenic assay. Because of
their benign nature, primary cultures of mouse Schwann
cells or human schwannoma cells do not form colonies in
this assay, and were therefore excluded from the analysis.
NXD30001 inhibited colony formation (both in number
and in size) of ESC-FC1801, 08031-9, and HEI193 in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the 72-hour cell
viability assay, the antiproliferative efﬁcacy in the long-term

for NF2-deﬁcient cells along with the mSC primary culture. Cells were treated with NXD30001 for 72 hours and the number of viable cells was quantiﬁed.
B, NF2-deﬁcient cells were treated with 100 nmol/L and 1,000 nmol/L NXD30001 in vitro and apoptotic cells were detected by ﬂuorometric terminal

C, NF2-deﬁcient cells were cultured as single cell suspension for 2 to 3 weeks in the soft agar media with or without NXD30001. Numbers of colonies
(n ¼ 3 per group) were quantiﬁed relative to the vehicle-treated control. D, NF2-deﬁcient cells were treated with various concentrations of NXD30001 for

culture was similar in the 3 cell lines tested, with GI50 ¼ 11.8

nmol/L, 10.8 nmol/L, and 10.0 nmol/L, respectively. The
result indicated that the pathway leading to growth inhibi-
tion was independent of the NF2 status because Nf2
ESC-
FC1801, HEI193 with isoform 3, and 08031-9 carrying
mutant NF2 responded similarly to the drug.

of HSP90 and its client proteins ErbB2, c-Met, Axl, c-Raf,

mSC (Fig. 2D). Upon HSP90 inhibition, HSP90 and
HSP70 increased concomitantly, whereas client proteins
showed dose-dependent degradation at 24 hours. Of the
concentrations tested, the minimum dose sufﬁcient to
deplete client proteins was 100 nmol/L for ESC-FC1801,
1,000 nmol/L for 08031-9, and between 100 nmol/L and

nmol/L showing resistance to protein degradation by
HSP90 inhibition in normal Schwann cells.

Given that drug efﬁcacy can differ between different
species, primary cultures of patient-derived schwannoma
and meningioma were also tested in the cell viability assay.
The GI50 for 10 human schwannoma and meningioma
ranged from 20 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L (Table 1). The NF2
mutation analysis on the original tumor samples revealed
no obvious correlation between drug sensitivity and the
NF2 status. However, the mitotically active cells of the
sporadic vestibular schwannoma-5, which carried biallelic
nonsense/frameshift NF2 mutations, showed high sensitiv-
ity to the drug. Likewise, highly proliferating spinal schwan-
noma-1 and meningioma-2, which were derived from a
single patient with NF2 with history of multiple lesions,
responded signiﬁcantly to the drug.

Antitumor efﬁcacy of NXD30001 in NF2-deﬁcient
allograft models in vivo

NXD30001 was administered for 4 weeks in 2 subcuta-
neous allograft models; ESC-FC1801 cells inoculated in
nude mice, and 08031-9 mouse schwannoma homogenate
inoculated in syngenic FVB/N mice.
In nude mice,
NXD30001 exhibited severe toxicity when administered at
100 mg/kg/d, 3 days/week, which resulted in progressive
weight loss (Fig. 3A, top left), compelling the change of
schedule to 2 days/week after the ﬁrst 2 weeks. By contrast,
FVB/N mice tolerated the same regime without major

weight loss (Fig. 3A, top right) or other clinical toxicities.
In both models, the tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhib-
ited in the drug-treated group (Fig. 3A, bottom, P < 0.001
and P < 0.0001, respectively).

The concentration of NXD30001 in the ESC-FC1801
tumors after repeated administration reached above 1 mg/
g, a dose equivalent to approximately 2 mmol/L in vitro (Fig.
3B, left). Furthermore, a single administration (100 mg/kg)
to the 08031-9 tumor-bearing FVB/N mice showed selective
drug accumulation in the tumors (Fig. 3B, right), resulting
in the tumor/plasma ratio of area under curve [AUC(0-t)] as
8.9. HSP90 client and related proteins (Axl, p-Akt, p-Erk,
and Cdk4) were reduced after 4-week drug administration
in the ESC-FC1801 tumors (Fig. 3C). Consistently, cellular
proliferation in the drug-treated tumors, evaluated by the
BrdUrd incorporation, was suppressed in the drug-treated
tumors (Fig. 3D).

Evaluation of HSP90 inhibition against orthotopic
tumor development in NF2 transgenic mice

The NF2 transgenic mouse model expressing a human
Sch-D(39–121) dominant-negative mutant protein was
previously created and characterized (12). Hundred per-
cent of the heterozygous transgenic mice in the (FVB/
NCrlxC3H/HeNCrl)F1 background were found to devel-
op multiple benign Schwann cell tumorlets in the spinal
nerve roots by 3 months of age (Fig. 3E). To evaluate
HSP90 inhibition as a preventive strategy in NF2, we
carried out drug efﬁcacy test against schwannoma devel-
opment using a well-characterized HSP90 inhibitor 17-
DMAG on our NF2 transgenic mice. No weight loss was

observed during the 8-week treatment with 17-DMAG at
10 mg/kg/d and 20 mg/kg/d, 3 days/week (Fig. 3F). About
a hundred microscopic ﬁelds per each group, covering
equivalent nerve root areas, from the lumber and sacral
spines were subjected to morphometric analysis (Fig. 3G).
Both the number of tumorlets per root area and the ratio
of tumorlet/root area were dose dependently reduced
after HSP90 inhibition (Fig. 3H and I).

Global transcriptional alterations induced by
NXD30001 in the NF2-deﬁcient cells

NGS was used to characterize the transcriptional conse-
quences of HSP90 inhibition in the NF2-deﬁcient cells. The
expression proﬁles of cultured ESC-FC1801 cells (control
vs. treated with 1 mmol/L NXD30001 for 24 hours) were
further compared with those of ESC-FC1801 tumors (con-
trol vs. treated with 100 mg/kg/d, 3 days/week for 2 weeks)
to provide the added context and contribution of the
microenvironment for growing tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). About 27 million paired-end reads of RNA
sequences per sample (100 bp in size, Illumina HiSeq
2000) from the in vitro experimental groups, and about
10 million single-end reads (76 bp in size, Illumina GAIIx)
from in vivo experimental groups, were obtained from
TopHat. The absolute values of gene expression for
35,604 gene loci were determined by Cufﬂinks and Cuf-
ﬂinks’ differential expression analysis (Cuffdiff; Supple-
mentary Fig. S2B). The differential expression in fold change
was highly reproducible by qPCR analysis conducted on
selected genes (Supplementary Table S2).

Alterations of HSP90 and its interacting proteins (www.
picard.ch/downloads/HSP90interactors)
upon HSP90
inhibition involved both up and downregulation (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2C; individual data in the GEO database). In
vitro, signiﬁcant increase of Hsp90aa1, Hsp90ab1, Hspa8
(HSC70), Hspa5 (GRP-78), and Hsf1 showed the well-
known response to HSP90 inhibition and heat shock.
Subsets of upregulated transcripts also indicated various
cellular
including induction of apoptosis
(Dedd2, Dapk3), autophagy (Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b, Gabar-
apl2), oxidative stress response (Pink1),
inﬂammatory
response (F2r), and antiapoptotic response (Sgk1). On the
other hand, survivin (Birk5), an apoptosis inhibitor and
essential regulator of mitosis, was among the most signif-
icantly downregulated transcripts whose expression was
reduced to less than 5% of control. Similarly, transcripts

of centrioles-associated tubulins (Tubd1 and Tube1), major-
ity of mitotic kinases (Cdk1, Cdk6, Cdk11, Aurkb, Plk1, Plk4),
DNA polymerases (Pola1, Pola2, Polh), DNA helicase (Blm),
DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins (Chek1&2,
Rad50, Mre11a), cell-cycle proteins (Ccnb1&2), and some
histone proteins were concomitantly silenced after the
HSP90 inhibition in vitro. In contrast, transcriptional alter-
ation in vivo included different gene sets: most of the
chaperone proteins, mitotic components, and DNA mod-
ulators remained unchanged. Instead, modiﬁcation was
observed in many cytoskeletal (actin, tubulin, myosin) and
histone components. However, the increase of apoptosis-
related genes (Dedd, Ask1) was in accordance with the
apoptotic response in vitro. Transcriptional changes in the
HSP90 clients implicated in NF2 included upregulation of
Pdgfrb, Erbb3, and Lats2, downregulation in Egfr, Vegfr2,
Esr1, and Akt3. The results showed that the overall con-
sequences are complex and involve multiple responses,
such as possible feedback required for the growth and
survival of ESC-FC1801 tumor graft.

Pathway analysis of HSP90 inhibition in NF2-deﬁcient
cells

Next, we aimed to systematically identify enriched path-
ways and regulatory networks that were affected by
NXD30001. Cuffdiff revealed changes in approximately
3% of the total genes; 1,383 and 965 genes in vitro and in
vivo, respectively, with 128 genes in common (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2B). Remarkably, there was almost no overlap in
the affected biologic processes between in vitro and in vivo
conditions (Table 2).

In vitro, there were signiﬁcant changes exclusively in a
gene set associated with cell-cycle and DNA damage (Table
2, top). NXD30001 increased the expression of genes
known to negatively regulate cell proliferation (Cgref1, Chfr,
Dusp1), whereas it depleted the expression of genes essential
for cell-cycle progression, DNA replication, and DNA repair.
These include phase-speciﬁc cyclins (Ccna2, Ccnb1&2,
Ccnd1), cell division cycle proteins (Cdc14a, Cdc25c), ini-
tiator of DNA replication (Prim1&2), DNA polymerases
(Pola1&2, Polh), DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1), mitotic
kinases (Aurka,b, Bub1, Bub1b), and anaphase-promoting
complex (APC; Anapc1,7). The major DNA repair check-
point proteins ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) and ATM
and RAD3 related (Atr), as well as DNA repair proteins
(Brca1&2) were also signiﬁcantly downregulated. These

with arrows, and the body weight and the tumor volume were monitored. ESC-FC1801 allograft tumors in female nude mice (n ¼ 10 per group)
and 08031-9 allograft tumors in FVB/N syngenic mice (n ¼ 15 per group) were treated with 100 mg/kg/d, 3 days/week. B, concentration of NXD30001 in
the plasma (top) and tumor (bottom) was determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Left, measurement in the ESC-FC1801
tumors treated with 100 mg/kg/d, 2 to 3 days/week for 4 weeks and collected 1 hour after the last injection. Right, measurement in the 08031-9
tumors treated with a single dose of 100 mg/kg and collected at indicated time (n ¼ 3 per group). C, pharmacodynamic analysis of ESC-FC1801
tumors treated with 100 mg/kg/d of NXD30001, 2 to 3 days/week for 2 and 4 weeks, showing downregulation of multiple HSP90 client proteins.

changes potentially affect all phases of the cell cycle, thereby
inhibiting cell proliferation.

In vivo, on the other hand, there were changes in genes
implicated in diverse biologic pathways (Table 2, bottom):
cell adhesion promoting genes Adam11&23, Cadm4, Mcam,
Chl1, Cdh13, Dlg1, integrins, laminins, and collagens, some of
which were shown to be absent in certain cancers, were
found to be upregulated. Conversely, merlin-interacting
hyaluronate (HA) receptor CD44 whose expression is
higher in Schwannoma (29) was downregulated. Many
genes involved in blood vessel development were also
deregulated; the reduced expression of vascular endotheli-
al-speciﬁc cadherin (Cdh5) and endothelial marker Pecam1,
together with complete lack of hemoglobin expression,
indicated the overall
suppression of vascularization.
Remarkably, genes associated with myelination and periph-
eral nervous system development, such as Ngfr, Erbb3, Egr2,
Sox10, Pmp22, and Plp1, were concomitantly upregulated in
the NXD30001-treated tumor.

Experimental validation of gene expression proﬁles

To validate the transcriptome analysis, we examined the
selected biologic processes altered by NXD30001. We iden-
tiﬁed severe downregulation of genes essential for DNA
synthesis, cell-cycle progression, and cell division in vitro.
Consistently, cell-cycle analysis revealed depletion of cells
in S phase and accumulation in G2–M phase after
NXD30001 treatment (Fig. 4A). The increasing population
of propidium iodide-unstained cells over time corre-
sponded with the induction of apoptosis. Immunocyto-
chemical staining conﬁrmed that BrdUrd incorporation was
signiﬁcantly suppressed after NXD30001 treatment (Fig.
4B). The results concluded that NXD30001 induced cell-
cycle arrest at multiple phases followed by apoptosis in ESC-
FC1801 cells in vitro.

In our in vivo model, genes involved in angiogenesis were
found to be deregulated in the drug-treated tumor. Accord-
ingly, we conducted immunohistochemistry of endothelial
marker PECAM-1, which revealed that the ESC-FC1801
tumors contained less blood vessels than the 08031-9 tumors
(Fig. 4C). Upon HSP90 inhibition, the number of blood
vessels signiﬁcantly decreased in the drug-treated tumors.

Many genes that encode major components of myelin
sheath, Pmp22, Mbp, Mpz, and Prx, were concomitantly
upregulated in the drug-treated tumor,
indicating that
HSP90 inhibition in the NF2-deﬁcient cells induced redif-
ferentiation toward Schwann cell
lineage. To test this
hypothesis, we examined the expression of Pmp22, Mpz,
and Mbp mRNA without or with NXD30001 in the ESC-
FC1801 and 08031-9 cells (1 mmol/L for 24 hours), and
their grafted tumors (100 mg/kg/d, 2 to 3 days/week for 4
weeks). Both tumors and cells showed upregulation of the
myelin-speciﬁc genes, particularly Pmp22 (Fig. 4D). The
effect was broader in the ESC-FC1801 cells, as no signiﬁcant
induction of Mpz was detected in 08031-9 cells. Remark-
ably, the proteins of these genes were not detectable in the
drug-treated cells despite the induction of their mRNA
in vitro (Fig. 4E).

Discussion

In this study, we validated the efﬁcacy of a novel HSP90
inhibitor NXD30001 against NF2-related tumors in vitro
and in vivo. Exposure to NXD30001 resulted in degradation
of major client proteins activated in NF2 concomitantly
with growth suppression in the NF2-deﬁcient cells. Degra-
dation occurred at lower doses in all NF2-deﬁcient cells

tested than in the normal Schwann cells in vitro. On the
other hand, cells derived from schwannoma (08031-9, HEI-
193, and human tumor primary cultures) manifested par-
tial resistance to apoptosis. Hence, HSP90 inhibition in
NF2-deﬁcient cells involves both cytostatic and cytotoxic
events, which together determined the overall antiproli-
ferative efﬁcacy. NXD30001 accumulated selectively in the

tumors well above the GI50 in vitro, hence, we conclude that
the observed antitumor activity in vivo is primarily attrib-
utable to the HSP90 inhibition.

The NF2-deﬁcient cells used in this study displayed dif-
ferential baseline gene expression, reﬂecting their difference
of origin and adaptation to the in vitro culture. For example,
absence of S100b and presence of Ngfrp75 in the ESC-
FC1801 cells indicated their immature nature as compared
with that of 08031-9 (30). Remarkably, the predominant
expression of Erbb2 and Erbb3 in ESC-FC1801 resembled
that of human schwannomas, which may have contributed
to its selective sensitivity to the drug, as exempliﬁed by the
study on melanoma cells where response to HSP90 inhi-
bition partly correlated with the expression of ERBB2 (31).
Nonetheless, the long-term exposure to the NXD30001 in
the clonogenic assay and in the allograft models showed
comparable antiproliferative effect in all cell lines tested,
implying that HSP90 inhibition by repeated dose may be
cumulative, and the effect is independent of the NF2 status.
Our allograft models of 2 different NF2-deﬁcient cells,
ESC-FC1801 and 08031-9, and the NF2 transgenic mouse
model, TgP0-Sch-D(39–121)-27, provide valuable tools
essential for preclinical study for NF2. In view of immune
system as body’s major defense mechanism against cancer
development, the use of immunocompetent FVB/N mice is
beneﬁcial for the evaluation of antitumor activity of a drug.
Furthermore, the preclinical use of a genetically modiﬁed
mouse model of NF2 schwannomagenesis allows us to
address the drug delivery to the peripheral nerves for the
efﬁcacy studies. Because of their extra-axial nature, schwan-
nomas are not protected by the blood–brain barrier (32). By
using different HSP90 inhibitors in multiple NF2 models in
vivo, we ascertained the efﬁcacy of HSP90 inhibition in the
NF2 tumorigenesis.

The drug sensitivity to NXD30001 in the patient-derived
schwannoma and meningioma primary cells in vitro was
variable. This implied that the clinical response of human
tumors to HSP90 inhibition may also differ signiﬁcantly
between patients. We identiﬁed a few schwannomas/
meningioma cells with signiﬁcant response to the HSP90
inhibition, which carry truncating mutations and/or are of
spinal origin from patients with severe clinical phenotypes
(i.e., younger age of onset, existence of multiple lesions, and
larger tumor size). These primary cells sustained advanced
proliferation over time despite that most human schwan-
noma/meningioma cells undergo progressive senescence in
a short period in vitro. Nonsense or frameshift NF2 muta-
tions have been associated to more severe disease pheno-
types in NF2 (33). Also, spinal tumors are associated with
severe NF2 phenotypes (34). Further analysis with larger
number of cases will be necessary to evaluate whether the
patients with NF2 malignant phenotypes have therapeutic
advantage in HSP90 inhibition.

The molecular consequences caused by HSP90 inhibition
in NF2-related tumors are of great interest, also in the
context of understanding NF2 tumorigenesis and therapeu-
tic targets. Our transcriptome analysis recapitulated many
biologic responses reported for HSP90 inhibition, includ-

ing cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, modiﬁcation of
cell adhesion and cytoskeletons, inhibition of angiogenesis,
and induction of cell differentiation. Furthermore, our data
showed striking differences in gene expression between the
short-term HSP90 inhibition in cell culture environment
and the long-term administration in the microenvironment
of solid tumor. Although many of the cell-cycle–associated
genes and DNA damage response genes are the known
HSP90 clients, the primary effect of NXD30001 in vitro was
exclusively enriched in suppression of cell-cycle transit,
DNA replication and repair, spindle assembly, and chro-
mosome separation. HSP90 protein was shown to be con-
centrated on the centrosomes whose inhibition caused
abnormal centrosome segregation and maturation, aber-
rant cell division spindles, and impaired chromosome
segregation (35). Recently, Lyman and colleagues system-
atically showed 3 types of perturbation in the cell cycle,
at M-phase, G2-phase, and G1-phase, by different HSP90
inhibitors in various cancer cells, signifying the multiple
involvement of HSP90 in cell proliferation (36).
NXD30001 also downregulated the expression of antiapop-
totic survivin (37) whose expression is positively regulated
by ErbB2 signaling (38). Our experimental validation show-
ing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis was in good agreement
with these results, which further indicated the potential of
HSP90 inhibition for sensitizing NF2-deﬁcient cells to
radiotherapy through suppression of DNA damage repair
mechanisms and cell survival.

The effect of NXD30001 in vivo involved complex bio-
logic changes including cell adhesion, extra-ellular matrix
remodeling, vascularization, and differentiation, where
much of merlin’s function is also implicated. Although
NXD30001 did not necessarily reverse the individual gene
expression deregulated in human schwannoma (39, 40),
the transcriptional alteration induced by NXD30001 and
by the restoration of wild-type merlin in the Nf2
ESC-
FC1801 cells overlapped strikingly (17), including down-
regulation of survivin, Aurkb, Brca2, Ccna2, Ccnd1, and
Dedd2. Moreover, a number of molecular markers for
tumorigenesis were altered toward expression proﬁle pref-
erable for therapeutic outcome. These results conﬁrmed the
beneﬁcial effect of targeting HSP90 in NF2.

 / 

There is no evidence that merlin directly regulates the
expression of HSP90. However, a recent study reported the
coimmunoprecipitation of merlin with HSP70, which
forms a multichaperone complex with HSP90 (21), imply-
ing that merlin may be regulated by or involved in the
function of this complex. Identiﬁcation of potential spec-
iﬁcity of HSP90 inhibition in the NF2-deﬁcient tumors will
be the next step of the study. CD44 is one of the few
transcripts that responded to HSP90 inhibition with signif-
icant decrease both in vitro and in vivo. Merlin functions in
contact inhibition of growth by inhibiting CD44 binding of
its ligand HA (16, 41). On the other hand, CD44–HA
interaction was shown to be essential for the activation of
ErbB2 in cancerous cells, inhibition of which caused dis-
assembly of a constitutive, lipidraft-associated, signaling
complex, containing phosphorylated-ErbB2, CD44, ezrin,

phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Hsp90, and cdc37 (42). Hence,
it is conceivable that merlin restoration and Hsp90 inhibi-
tion share a common molecular effect to suppress ErbB2
cells through disruption of
signaling complex in Nf2
CD44–HA interaction and complex assembly.

 / 

The present study also showed that the HSP90 inhibition
in NF2-deﬁcient cells simultaneously increased the tran-
scription of myelin sheath-speciﬁc genes as well as the core
transcription factors for Schwann cell differentiation, which
are downregulated in the human vestibular schwannomas
(43). Recently, the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, was shown
to improve myelination of Schwann cells of neuropathic
mice by increasing the expression of myelin-speciﬁc genes
(44). Loss of NF2 constitutively activates mTOR complex 1
(45), whereas geldanamycin suppresses the mTOR-raptor
signaling pathway (46), hence, the upregulation of myelin-
speciﬁc genes by NXD30001 may be accomplished through
inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. Property of
HSP90 inhibitors to induce differentiation has been
reported in different tumor cells: ansamycin induced func-
tional differentiation in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells
(47). Likewise, radicicol increased expression of erythroid
differentiation marker in myelogenous leukemia cells (48).
Our transcriptome data may facilitate the identiﬁcation of
common mechanisms shared in the HSP90 inhibition and
differentiation of tumor cells of different origins.

Taken together, HSP90 inhibition showed signiﬁcant
antitumor efﬁcacy in NF2-deﬁcient cells in vitro and in vivo.
Our ﬁndings provide sufﬁcient preclinical evidence for the
beneﬁt of the HSP90 inhibition against NF2-related tumors
in human patients.
