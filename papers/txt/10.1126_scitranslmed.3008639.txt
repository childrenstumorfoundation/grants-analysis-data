Editor's Summary

Therapeutic Magic Without Merlin

Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer of the pleura (lung lining), which is very difficult to treat and often recurs

after therapy. Now, Shapiro and coauthors have discovered that mesotheliomas and other tumors that are low in a 
tumor suppressor called Merlin are particularly sensitive to treatment with a new drug called VS-4718, which blocks
the activity of the enzyme focal adhesion kinase. Moreover, in preclinical testing, VS-4718 was particularly effective 
killing cancer stem cells, which are the hardest to eradicate with conventional chemotherapy and can give rise to 
recurrent tumors. These results suggest that VS-4718 or a similar drug may make a valuable addition to the standard
treatment regimen for mesothelioma and may reduce the risk of relapse in this cancer.

Merlin Deficiency Predicts FAK Inhibitor Sensitivity:
A Synthetic Lethal Relationship

The goal of targeted therapy is to match a selective drug with a genetic lesion that predicts for drug sensitivity.
In a diverse panel of cancer cell lines, we found that the cells most sensitive to focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
inhibition lack expression of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, Merlin. Merlin
expression is often lost in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-induced aggressive cancer with
limited treatment options. Our data demonstrate that low Merlin expression predicts for increased sensitivity of
MPM cells to a FAK inhibitor, VS-4718, in vitro and in tumor xenograft models. Disruption of MPM cell-cell or
cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts with blocking antibodies suggests that weak cell-cell adhesions in Merlin-
negative MPM cells underlie their greater dependence on cell-ECM–induced FAK signaling. This provides one
explanation of why Merlin-negative cells are vulnerable to FAK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, we validated alde-
hyde dehydrogenase as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MPM, a cell population thought to mediate tumor
relapse after chemotherapy. Whereas pemetrexed and cisplatin, standard-of-care agents for MPM, enrich for CSCs,
FAK inhibitor treatment preferentially eliminates these cells. These preclinical results provide the rationale for a
clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design,
the FAK inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through reduction of CSCs along with a
strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially
benefit from FAK inhibitor treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important cancer target because
FAK gene amplification and protein overexpression have been demon-
strated in a wide range of malignancies (1). FAK is a nonreceptor pro-
tein tyrosine kinase that integrates signals from integrins and growth
factor receptors to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, inva-
sion, and cancer stem cell (CSC) renewal (1–3). FAK inhibitors have
been shown to decrease tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical
models, and have shown initial clinical activity in cancer patients (4–6).
Although elevated FAK expression is often observed in human tu-
mors, no specific mutations or translocations have been identified to
predict which patient population is most likely to respond to a FAK in-
hibitor. Successful targeted therapies that pair small-molecule inhibitors
with specific activated oncogenes include agents targeting BCR-ABL and
EML4-ALK translocations, HER2 gene amplification, and activating
mutations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and B-RAF (7).
Alternatively, identification of a synthetic lethal relationship between
a drug target and loss of a tumor suppressor is exemplified by the ef-
ficacy of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP) in-
hibitors in breast cancer bearing BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (7). An
analogous therapeutic strategy could greatly facilitate the clinical de-
velopment of a FAK inhibitor.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene en-
codes the Merlin protein, which has sequence homology with the ez-
rin/radixin/moesin (ERM) protein family (8). Merlin mediates tumor

suppression and cell contact inhibition through reduction of Rac-
PAK, mTORC1, Hippo, EGFR, and FAK-Src signaling (9). Merlin lo-
calizes to cell-cell boundaries, where it plays a role in the maturation
of adherens junctions (10, 11). Germline mutations in NF2 contribute
to development of type 2 neurofibromatosis, which is characterized by
growth of meningiomas, ependymomas, and schwannomas (12). In
addition, NF2 is frequently inactivated in human malignant pleural
mesothelioma (MPM), where biallelic inactivation of NF2 occurs in
40 to 50% of tumors (12, 13). MPM is an aggressive tumor of the
pleural lining of the lung and is often associated with previous expo-
sure to asbestos (13). It has been estimated that as many as 43,000
people worldwide die from MPM each year (14). Median overall sur-
vival following frontline chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin
is about 12 months (15). New therapies are urgently needed to im-
prove the prognosis of patients with MPM.

CSCs comprise a subpopulation of tumor cells that have self-
renewal capacity, exhibit elevated resistance to chemotherapeutic agents,
and are often responsible for tumor recurrence (16). CSCs have been
identified in many cancer types, including colorectal, breast, ovarian,
pancreatic, prostate, and head and neck cancers (17). Several studies
found cells with CSC properties in MPM (18, 19). Moreover, an ele-
vated CSC population has been demonstrated in a mouse model of ag-
gressive NF2-deficient asbestos-induced mesothelioma (20). FAK plays
a role in self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and maintenance of mammary
CSCs (2). Therefore, therapeutic targeting of FAK may diminish CSCs
in a variety of malignancies including MPM.

Here, we aimed to identify cancers most sensitive to FAK inhibi-
tion and discover biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit
from a FAK inhibitor treatment. VS-4718, previously known as PND-
1186 (21), is a potent and selective FAK inhibitor (fig. S1). We found

that VS-4718 is especially effective against
Merlin-negative cell lines of certain cancer
types including MPM in vitro and in vivo,
and have uncovered a mechanism gov-
erning sensitivity to the FAK inhibitor.
The preferential inhibitory effect of VS-
4718 on CSCs, in addition to eradication
of non-CSCs, provides a rationale for clin-
ical use of a FAK inhibitor as a single agent
after first-line chemotherapy. Together,
these studies establish the effectiveness of
a FAK inhibitor for treatment of Merlin-
negative tumors and identify MPM as a
promising setting for a Merlin-stratified
clinical trial.

RESULTS

Effects of FAK inhibitor on
Merlin-positive and Merlin-negative
cancer cell lines
Depletion of FAK by short hairpin RNA
or pharmacological inhibition of FAK
protein kinase activity has been demon-
strated to reduce cell proliferation in three-
dimensional (3D) culture more effectively
than in 2D culture (22). To assess the ef-
fects of VS-4718 treatment on cell growth,
we modeled the tumor microenvironment
using the “Matrigel on top” (MoT) meth-
od [adapted from (22), see Materials and
Methods]. A panel of 47 human cancer cell
lines representing diverse tumors, including
renal, thyroid, ovarian and breast carcinomas,
non–small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and
mesothelioma, was tested for sensitivity
to VS-4718 in MoT culture. Seven of the
10 most sensitive cell lines [average EC50
(half-maximal effective concentration) =
0.24 mM] lack Merlin protein expression
(Fig. 1A and fig. S2). Among the 37 less sen-
sitive cell lines (average EC50 = 1.85 mM),
most (92%) expressed high Merlin levels,
whereas only a minority (8%) exhibited
loss of Merlin protein expression (Fig. 1A
and fig. S2). Hence, loss of Merlin corre-
lated with increased sensitivity to the VS-
4718 FAK inhibitor in vitro.

To test whether enhanced FAK inhibi-
tor sensitivity of Merlin-negative cells occurs
in vivo, we assessed the antitumor efficacy
of VS-4718 in Merlin-negative MDA-MB-
231 and Merlin-positive MDA-MB-468 hu-
man triple-negative breast cancer xenograft
models. In vitro, MDA-MB-231 cells were
>60-fold more sensitive to VS-4718 than
MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In vivo,

in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, mice dosed orally twice daily
with VS-4718 at 25 mg/kg had significantly smaller tumors (P = 0.006)
than those receiving vehicle control after 29 days of treatment. Moreover,
tumor regression was observed in mice treated with VS-4718 (100 mg/kg)
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 1D), with corresponding significant reduction of tumor
FAK (pY397) autophosphorylation (P = 0.03; fig. S3). In contrast, the
Merlin-positive MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer xenograft model
showed substantially less antitumor efficacy after 29 days of treatment with
VS-4718 at 25 or 100 mg/kg (Fig. 1E). Final average tumor weights in VS-
4718–treated groups were reduced only by ~30% relative to the vehicle
control group despite significant inhibition of tumor pFAK-Y397 (P =
0.0002; Fig. 1E and fig. S3). Hence, tumor growth was suppressed in a
dose-dependent manner in the Merlin-negative MDA-MB-231 xenograft
model, with less tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the Merlin-positive
MDA-MB-468 model. Thus, we conclude that Merlin-negative cancer cells
are especially sensitive to the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 in vitro and in vivo.

FAK inhibitor sensitivity of Merlin-negative
mesotheliomas in vitro
NF2 mutations are common in MPM, with about 40 to 50% of tumors
exhibiting biallelic inactivation of NF2, leading to absent or low Merlin

expression (12, 13). Accordingly, we examined a panel of mesothelioma
cell lines for their FAK inhibitor sensitivity and assessed Merlin ex-
pression by Western blotting. Mero-25, MSTO-211H, H28, and H2452
MPM cell lines had high levels of Merlin, whereas Merlin expression was
essentially undetectable in Mero-41, Mero-48a, Mero-83, MM87, and
MM129 mesothelioma cell lines (Fig. 2A). Mero-14 expressed a short
(~56 kD) isoform 7 variant of Merlin.

We assessed the effect of VS-4718 on the proliferation of these MPM
cell lines in 3D MoT culture. Merlin-positive MPM cell lines exhibited an
average EC50 of ~3.5 mM, whereas the average EC50 for Merlin-negative
MPM cell lines was 0.3 mM (Fig. 2B and fig. S4). In addition to greater
potency of VS-4718, all Merlin-negative cell lines demonstrated a greater
magnitude of response, exhibiting cell viability curves that approached
zero, suggesting a cytotoxic effect of VS-4718 (Fig. 2B). Together, these
data demonstrated that Merlin-negative mesothelioma cells are more sen-
sitive to VS-4718 than Merlin-positive cells in vitro in 3D culture.

To test for a causal contribution of Merlin expression in regulating
the effect of VS-4718 on cell viability, we created isogenic MPM and
breast cancer cell lines by ectopically expressing full-length NF2 fused
to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Merlin expression was confirmed
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). Cell growth inhibition analysis

demonstrated decreased sensitivity of MM87
MPM cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells expressing NF2-GFP to VS-4718, in
contrast to cells infected with GFP vector
control (Fig. 2D and fig. S5). The VS-4718
EC50 in control MM87/GFP cells was
~300 nM, whereas in MM87/NF2-GFP cells
the EC50 was increased by about threefold
(Fig. 2D). This demonstrated that ectopic
expression of full-length Merlin reduced
sensitivity to the FAK inhibitor VS-4718,
consistent with our hypothesis that FAK
inhibitor sensitivity in Merlin-negative
mesothelioma and breast cancer cells is
enhanced by loss of Merlin.

To determine whether biological deple-
tion of FAK would mimic the effect of VS-
4718, we depleted FAK by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) in MPM cell lines and as-
sessed cell proliferation in 3D MoT culture.
Treatment of MPM cell lines with FAK
siRNA resulted in reduction of FAK mRNA
levels by 89 to 93% (fig. S6). Ki-67 stain-
ing was reduced about 3.5-fold in Merlin-
negative Mero-41 cells (Fig. 2E), indicating
reduced proliferation in response to FAK
depletion. In contrast, reduction in Ki-67
positivity in Merlin-positive MSTO-211H
cells in response to FAK siRNA treatment
was marginal (Fig. 2E). These data demon-
strate that depletion of FAK by siRNA mimics
VS-4718 treatment and reduces prolifera-
tion especially in Merlin-negative cells.

FAK inhibitor efficacy in
Merlin-negative mesotheliomas
in vivo
To extend our observation to an in vivo
mesothelioma model, we first tested the
efficacy of VS-4718 in a Merlin-negative
MPM lung tumor model. Merlin-negative
MM87 murine mesothelioma cells were
injected into the tail vein of mice and al-
lowed to seed in the lungs for 7 days, and
then animals were treated orally twice daily
with VS-4718 at 75 mg/kg for 2 weeks. By
initiating treatment 7 days after tail vein
injection, this assay was intended to mea-
sure tumor growth in the lungs, rather than
assessing elements of the initial metastatic
process. At the end of the VS-4718 treat-
ment on day 21 after initial tail vein injec-
tion, the tumor burden in the lungs of
VS-4718–treated animals averaged 3.5-fold
less than in the lungs of vehicle control–
treated animals (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A), sug-
gestive of an inhibitory effect of the FAK
inhibitor on tumor growth in the lungs.

We also tested the effect of VS-4718 in an MM87 intraperitoneal
orthotopic xenograft model. Animals treated with VS-4718 (25 mg/kg)
orally twice daily for 2 weeks had small tumors with an average volume
of about 100 mm3, in contrast to control-treated animals that had large
tumors with an average volume of about 500 mm3. A measurable tu-
mor was observed in only 1 of 10 animals treated for 2 weeks with VS-
4718 (50 or 75 mg/kg) orally twice daily (Fig. 3B). This indicated that
the FAK inhibitor was efficacious in a Merlin-negative mesothelioma
model in a dose-dependent manner. pFAK-Y397 was significantly in-
hibited in the tumors treated with VS-4718 (P = 0.016; Fig. 3C), establish-
ing a clear correlation between target inhibition and antitumor efficacy.
No significant change in tumor burden was observed in Merlin-positive
MSTO-211H xenografts treated with VS-
4718 orally twice daily at 75 mg/kg for
11 days (fig. S7), despite ~67% inhibi-
tion of tumor FAK-Y397 phosphorylation
(P = 0.0051; fig. S7).

As a closer approximation of human
cancer, we assessed the effect of VS-4718
in mice bearing human MPM patient-
derived xenografts (PDXs). Merlin-negative
and Merlin-positive PDX models (fig. S8)
were chosen for this experiment, and FAK
inhibitor treatment was initiated when tu-
mors reached 200 mm3. FAK autophos-
phorylation was effectively inhibited in
both PDX models treated with VS-4718
(50 mg/kg) (fig. S8). Merlin-positive PDX
tumors treated with VS-4718 at 50 mg/kg
averaged only 23% smaller than control
tumors at the end of the study on day 42
(Fig. 3D). In contrast, in the Merlin-negative
PDX study, mice treated orally twice daily
with VS-4718 (50 mg/kg) exhibited 56%
TGI on day 35 compared to vehicle-treated
control animals (P = 0.0089; Fig. 3E). Col-
lectively, these observations demonstrate
that Merlin-negative mesotheliomas are
sensitive to the FAK inhibitor in vivo in
mouse xenograft models and in a human
PDX model.

Effects of FAK inhibitor
treatment on cell proliferation
and apoptosis
Reduced cell number in response to
VS-4718 could potentially result from
reduction of cell proliferation and/or in-
duction of apoptosis. We therefore assessed
the effects of VS-4718 on caspase 3/7 activ-
ity as a marker of apoptosis, and Ki-67
positivity as an indicator of cell prolifera-
tion in mesothelioma cells. We observed
two- to threefold induction of caspase 3/7
activity in response to VS-4718 treatment
in a panel of human Merlin-negative MPM
cell lines—Mero-41, Mero-48a, and Mero-
83—with only weak caspase 3/7 activation

in Merlin-positive Mero-25 and H28 cells (Fig. 4A). Ki-67 staining was
markedly reduced in Merlin-negative Mero-48a and Mero-41 cells treated
with VS-4718, whereas little reduction in Ki-67 staining was observed in
Merlin-positive MSTO-211H and H28 cells (Fig. 4B). These results in-
dicate that the FAK inhibitor reduced both the proliferation and viabil-
ity of Merlin-negative cells.

The AKT family of kinases regulates cell survival and proliferation
(23). To better understand the inhibitory effect of VS-4718 on cell sur-
vival, we measured AKT activation in cells grown in 3D MoT culture.
After 1 hour of VS-4718 treatment, FAK activation (pFAK-Y397) was
inhibited to a similar extent in Merlin-negative Mero-41 and Mero-48a
cells as in Merlin-positive H28 and MSTO-211H cells (Fig. 4, C to F, and

after 1 hour of VS-4718 treatment, we observed reduced AKT activa-
tion (pAKT-S473) in Merlin-negative Mero-41 and Mero-48a cells sus-
tained for 48 hours, whereas no inhibition
of AKT activation was detected in Merlin-
positive H28 or MSTO-211H cells (Fig. 4, C
to F, and fig. S9). VS-4718 had no effect on
extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) activation in both Merlin-negative
and Merlin-positive cells. These observa-
tions suggest that in the absence of Merlin,
inhibition of AKT activation may medi-
ate the proapoptotic effect of the FAK in-
hibitor on MPM cells. Together, these
data indicate that Merlin-negative MPM
cells are dependent on FAK signaling for
both cell survival and proliferation in a
3D environment.

Potential mechanism of FAK
inhibitor sensitivity in cells lacking
Merlin expression
Merlin has been shown to play an impor-
tant role in the establishment of stable ad-
herens junctions in epithelial and Schwann
cells in vitro and in vivo (10, 11). We hy-
pothesized that survival and proliferation
of tumor cells may depend on a balance
between cell-cell contacts supported by
Merlin and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM)
adhesion supported by integrin and FAK
signaling. To confirm Merlin’s role in cell-
cell adhesion, we examined whether Merlin
expression status would affect the mor-
phology of cell colonies in MoT culture.
Indeed, Merlin-positive MSTO-211H cells
exhibited round mass colony morphology
in 3D, suggestive of robust cell-cell adhe-
sions (24), whereas Merlin-negative H2052
cells formed invasive stellate-like colonies
(Fig. 5A). Merlin-negative parental MDA-
MB-231 cells formed stellate, poorly consol-
idated colonies in MoT culture, as expected
(24), which changed into round, smooth-
surfaced morphology upon forced ex-
pression of NF2 (Fig. 5A), consistent with
the known role of Merlin in stabilizing
cell-cell junctions.

The destabilization of adherens junc-
tions in Merlin-negative cells may result
in an up-regulation of integrin-FAK sig-
naling and increased levels of pFAK be-
cause cells compensate for the loss of
trophic signals normally derived from
cell-cell contacts. An inhibitory effect of
Merlin expression on FAK activation
has been previously demonstrated in
mesothelioma and glial cells (25, 26).

at focal adhesions in cells with detectable Merlin expression (fig. S10).
To test FAK activation in a 3D environment, we performed an ELISA
to detect the activated form of FAK (pFAK-Y397) in Merlin-negative
MDA-MB-231 parental cells and in cells engineered to express NF2.
We found that activated FAK levels were decreased by about 70% upon
expression of NF2 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that ectopic Merlin expression
diminished FAK activation.

We hypothesized that Merlin-positive cells forced to lose cell-cell
interactions might become more dependent on cell-ECM interactions
and thus on FAK signaling. To test this directly, we assessed FAK in-
hibitor sensitivity in 3D culture of Merlin-positive MSTO-211H and
H28 cells, both of which express N-cadherin (fig. S11), in the presence
of an N-cadherin–blocking antibody used to disrupt cell-cell adhe-
sions (27). The N-cadherin–blocking antibody reduced b-catenin
recruitment to cell-cell junctions indicative of defective cell-cell adhe-
sions (fig. S11). Whereas Merlin-positive MSTO-211H cells were only
modestly sensitive to VS-4718, exhibiting an EC50 of 11 mM, the N-
cadherin–blocking antibody increased the potency of VS-4718 by about
60-fold, resulting in an EC50 of 180 nM (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the N-
cadherin antibody increased the sensitivity of Merlin-positive H28 cells
to VS-4718 (fig. S11). These results support the concept that blocking
cell-cell contacts in a Merlin-positive context renders cells more
dependent on cell-ECM–stimulated FAK signaling.

We further hypothesized that reducing cell-ECM interactions through
disruption of b1 integrin activity in Merlin-negative cells would sup-
plant FAK inhibition, decreasing sensitivity to the FAK inhibitor. There-
fore, we assessed whether a b1 integrin–blocking antibody would inhibit
FAK activation and reduce proliferation of MPM cells. In Merlin-negative
Mero-41 and Mero-83 cells, b1 integrin blockade indeed reduced FAK
activation in contrast to Merlin-positive H28 and Mero-25 cells (fig.
S12). Proliferation of Merlin-negative Mero-41 cells was markedly re-
duced (90%) by treatment with the b1 integrin–blocking antibody (Fig.
5D), thus mimicking the effect of the FAK inhibitor. Moreover, blocking
of b1 integrin activity rendered Merlin-negative Mero-41 cells relatively
insensitive to further reduction of proliferation by VS-4718, with an
EC50 of 12 mM compared to an EC50 of 0.31 mM in the control IgG–treated
cells (Fig. 5E). In contrast, in Merlin-positive Mero-25 cells, the b1 integrin–
blocking antibody had no effect on proliferation (Fig. 5D) or response
to VS-4718 (Fig. 5F), suggesting lack of dependence of Merlin-positive
cells on b1 integrin/FAK signaling. Together, we conclude that a balance
between cell-cell adhesion and b1 integrin–mediated cell-ECM interaction
regulates sensitivity to FAK inhibitor in MPM cells.

Preferential effect of FAK inhibitor on mesothelioma
CSCs in vitro and in vivo
FAK has been shown to play a role in self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capability of CSCs in a mouse model of breast cancer (2). Therefore, we
were interested to assess the role of CSC depletion in the antitumor ef-
ficacy of the FAK inhibitor in MPM cells. CSCs are defined as a subpop-
ulation of cancer cells that (i) can self-renew, (ii) has tumor-initiating
capability, and (iii) can differentiate into heterogeneous cell types within
tumors (17). An Aldefluor assay, which measures aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity, has been used in various cancer types to define and
isolate CSCs (17). To validate Aldefluor as a CSC marker in MPM, we
assessed self-renewal, tumor-initiating capability, and differentiation
within tumors.

The MM87 MPM cell line has, on average, 3.8 ± 1.4% Aldefluor+
cells. The self-renewal potential of Aldefluor+ MM87 MPM cells was

assessed in a tumorsphere assay (17). Increased tumorsphere-forming
efficiency of Aldefluor+ MM87 cells was evident in primary and second-
ary tumorsphere assays. MM87 cells isolated from primary tumorspheres
generated 85.6 ± 6.5 secondary spheres, whereas Aldefluor− cells only
generated 8.6 ± 5.3 spheres (fig. S13), suggesting increased self-renewal
capability of Aldefluor+ MPM cells. To assess the tumor-initiating po-
tential of Aldefluor+ MPM cells, we sorted Aldefluor+ or Aldefluor− MM87
cells and injected them subcutaneously into nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice at various cell numbers
per injection from 100,000 down to 50 cells (limiting dilution); tumor
burden was evaluated 3 weeks later. Large tumors of ~1000 mm3 were
formed in mice injected with as few as 50 Aldefluor+ cells within 3 weeks,
whereas Aldefluor− cells typically required injection of 1000 cells to
initiate tumors (Fig. 6, A and B). Overall, Aldefluor+ cells had ~35-fold
higher tumor-initiating potential than Aldefluor− cells (P < 0.0001; Fig.
6B). To assess the ability of Aldefluor+ MPM cells to differentiate with-
in tumors, we analyzed Aldefluor+ and Aldefluor− cell content in MPM
tumors formed from MM87 Aldefluor+ cells. After 3 weeks, tumors from
Aldefluor+ cell injection retained only ~1% Aldefluor+ cells, whereas the
bulk of the tumor consisted of Aldefluor− cells (fig. S13), suggesting
that Aldefluor+ cells differentiated into Aldefluor− cells during tumor
growth. Together, these data validate Aldefluor as a tumor-initiating
cell/CSC marker in MPM.

We next determined whether the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 has an ef-
fect on tumor-initiating cells in MPM. Changes in the Aldefluor+ cell
subpopulation in Merlin-negative H2052 mesothelioma cells were as-
sessed in response to VS-4718 or treatment with the standard-of-care
cytotoxic agents pemetrexed, cisplatin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine. VS-
4718 treatment reduced the percentage of Aldefluor+ cells in direct con-
trast with the standard cytotoxic agents, which enriched the Aldefluor+
cell subpopulation (Fig. 6C). Similar effects of VS-4718 on Aldefluor+
CSCs were observed in the Mero-83 and Mero-48a MPM cell lines (fig.
S14). Moreover, when used in combination, VS-4718 blocked the en-
richment of Aldefluor+ cells by pemetrexed (Fig. 6D), suggesting that
FAK activity is necessary for survival and/or proliferation of mesothe-
lioma tumor-initiating CSCs in vitro.

ALDH1 expression, like Aldefluor activity, has been widely used as
a CSC marker (17). Accordingly, we attempted to extend the above
observations to an in vivo model of MPM. ALDH1 immunofluores-
cence analysis demonstrated that control MPM tumors in an MM87
intraperitoneal xenograft model had dispersed ALDH1-positive cells.
In contrast, tumors from animals treated with VS-4718 at 50 mg/kg
(orally, twice daily) showed a marked reduction of ALDH1-positive
cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the FAK
inhibitor decreased tumor-initiating CSC content in Merlin-negative
MPM in vitro and in vivo.

Standard frontline therapy for patients with mesothelioma typically
consists of pemetrexed in combination with a platinum agent (15). Be-
cause pemetrexed and platinum increase the proportion of CSCs in
MPM cells (Fig. 6C), we reasoned that the use of a FAK inhibitor as
a single agent after frontline chemotherapy to suppress CSCs and tumor
recurrence might effectively extend survival. To model this preclinically,
we used a Merlin-negative MPM PDX model (Fig. 3E). Mice bearing
Merlin-negative PDX tumors were first treated with cisplatin and peme-
trexed for 14 days, followed by vehicle control or VS-4718 treatment for
an additional 32 days to model maintenance treatment. Combination
treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed resulted in complete TGI on
day 14; however, tumors regrew after cessation of treatment, reaching

1000 mm3 by day 46 (Fig. 3E). In contrast, treatment with VS-4718 as a
single agent starting on day 16, after cessation of the cisplatin/pemetrexed
regimen, substantially delayed tumor regrowth, resulting in 77% TGI
by day 46 compared to the cisplatin/pemetrexed arm (P = 0.035; Fig. 3E).
These results demonstrate that a FAK inhibitor can indeed extend the
duration of TGI, providing a more durable response when used as a
single agent after cisplatin/pemetrexed treatment in a PDX model of
mesothelioma.

DISCUSSION

Targeted therapies tailored to cancers with specific genetic lesions
have emerged as effective anticancer treatments. In the absence of a
specific activating mutation or translocation of the drug target, anoth-
er promising approach is to establish a “synthetic lethal” relationship
wherein pharmacological inhibition of one gene product is especially
efficacious in the background of loss of function of a second gene
product (7). Our studies reveal that a potent and selective FAK inhib-
itor, VS-4718, is efficacious in several cancer types, and that Merlin
deficiency is a potential predictive marker for enhanced response to
the FAK inhibitor in MPM. Our work also demonstrates that the
FAK inhibitor targets CSCs in MPM, in contrast to cytotoxic agents
that enrich the CSC population. Together, our data suggest a synthetic
lethal relationship between Merlin loss and FAK inhibitor sensitivity
and provide an attractive strategy for clinical testing of FAK inhibitors
in patients with MPM.

NF2 expression and function can be lost in tumors by a variety of
mechanisms, including mutation, chromosome loss, and focal dele-
tions (13). NF2 is mutated in about 40 to 50% of MPMs, with lower fre-
quency of mutations in several other cancer types (12, 13). Additional
promising indications for clinical use of FAK inhibitors may include
other tumors with high prevalence of NF2 loss, such as schwannomas,
meningiomas, and ependymomas, resulting from neurofibromatosis
type 2 syndrome (89% NF2 mutations) (28 ) and high-grade malignant
meningioma (29). Additional studies are needed to unequivocally ex-
tend the synthetic lethal relationship between Merlin loss and FAK
inhibitor sensitivity to other tumor types beyond the MPM tumors
studied here.

A few reports have suggested a potential role of Merlin in regulating
FAK activity in MPM and glial cells (25, 26). FAK has been demon-
strated to play a role in proliferation, migration, and survival of NF2–/–
schwannoma cells through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/
AKT and ERK signaling pathways (9). Ectopic expression of Merlin in
NF2–/– MPM cells inhibited invasion, decreased FAK Tyr397 phosphoryl-
ation, and impaired FAK interaction with its binding partners Src and
p85 (26). However, an effect of Merlin expression on the antiprolifera-
tive and proapoptotic activities of FAK inhibitors has not previously
been investigated.

Merlin has been shown to play a role in the establishment of stable
adherens junctions in several epithelial cell types (11, 30). Our data
support a model in which the well-established cell-cell junctions in
Merlin-positive MPM cells provide survival and proliferation signals
independent of FAK signaling, explaining their reduced sensitivity to
inhibition of FAK kinase activity (Fig. 7). In contrast, Merlin-negative
cells with weak cell-cell contacts depend more on cell-ECM–induced
FAK activation for proliferation and resistance to apoptosis and are
therefore more sensitive to FAK kinase inhibition (Fig. 7). Accordingly,

it may be possible to extend this observation to other cancers with
weak cell-cell adhesions. For example, others have suggested that an-
other FAK inhibitor, BI 853520, may be most effective in treatment of
tumors with low expression of E-cadherin, another essential mediator
of adherens junctions (31). The enhanced sensitivity of CAL-62, COV318,
and CAOV-4 ovarian cancer cell lines to VS-4718 (Fig. 1A) despite
wild-type Merlin expression supports the notion that additional mo-
lecular markers and mechanisms predictive of FAK inhibitor sensitiv-
ity remain to be elucidated.

Our data also demonstrate that a FAK inhibitor preferentially tar-
gets tumor-initiating CSCs in MPM. CSCs are thought to play an inte-
gral role in metastasis and recurrence after chemotherapy (17). Although
several putative CSC markers have been proposed in MPM (18, 19),
they have not been rigorously validated. ALDH activity has been used
to define CSCs in numerous solid tumor types (17). We validated ALDH
activity (Aldefluor) as a marker of CSCs in MPM through the use of
tumor initiation, tumorsphere self-renewal, and in vivo differentiation
assays. In murine and human mesothelioma samples, VS-4718 decreased
ALDH-positive cells in vitro and in vivo, establishing the FAK inhibitor
as an anti-CSC agent in mesothelioma. Recent evidence in the litera-
ture implies a potential role for FAK in CSC proliferation, differenti-
ation, motility, and invasion (32). Distinct roles for kinase-dependent
and kinase-independent activities of FAK have been suggested in reg-
ulation of mammary stem cell biology (33). Our data demonstrate the
importance of FAK kinase activity for the maintenance of CSCs in
mesothelioma.

Frontline cytotoxic therapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin is the
standard of care for treatment of MPM (15). Our data demonstrate
that treatment of mesothelioma cells with these agents increases the
proportion of CSCs, which may account for the tumor recurrence that
invariably follows initial response. Treatment with a FAK inhibitor af-
ter completion of first-line therapy might extend survival through
MPM TGI coupled with the preferential suppression of CSCs. The
striking tumor growth delay observed with FAK inhibitor administra-
tion after combination treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed in an

Fig. 7. FAK inhibitor sensitivity depends on the balance between cell-ECM
and cell-cell interactions. In Merlin-positive cells, stable cell-cell adhesions de-
crease dependence on FAK signaling for survival and proliferation, thus causing
low sensitivity to FAK inhibition. In Merlin-negative cells, strong dependence
on cell-ECM interactions is mediated through b1 integrin/FAK signaling
important for cell survival and proliferation, and leads to greater sensitiv-
ity to FAK inhibition. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of this
balance influence FAK inhibitor sensitivity accordingly.

MPM PDX model provides preclinical proof of concept for this strat-
egy. Recent data from a phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated increased
progression-free survival of MPM patients treated with a FAK in-
hibitor (GSK2256098). The disease stabilization was especially pro-
nounced in Merlin-low mesothelioma patients (34). Together, the
data presented here provide strong rationale for a clinical trial of a FAK
inhibitor administered to MPM patients after first-line therapy with
stratification based on Merlin protein expression (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01870609).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design
Mouse models of mesothelioma, human MPM PDXs, MSTO-211H,
MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous xenograft experiments
are described in detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Briefly, endpoints of each study included assessment of the antitumor
activity of compounds based on TGI at the end of the study and quan-
tification of pFAK-Y397 in tumor samples. For subcutaneous models,
animals were randomized into treatment or control groups when tu-
mors reached about 125 to 250 mm3 and dosing was initiated. All of
the studies were powered to have an 80% (1 − b) chance of detecting a
significant difference in tumor burden at the end of the study specifying
a = 0.05 (two-tailed testing). Control cohorts had tight tumor growth
curves, allowing to be adequately powered with experimental recipient
cohorts of average size n = 5 to 10. Original data for animal studies are
provided in table S1. For mouse models of mesothelioma, all animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of Fox
Chase Cancer Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Cell culture and compound treatment
Cell lines used in this study and culture conditions are described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Cells were treated with VS-4718,
pemetrexed, cisplatin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine for 4 days. VS-4718,
pemetrexed, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine was added at 15 µl per well in a
96-well plate as 10× DMSO solution (n = 6 per concentration point).
Cisplatin was diluted from 10× NaCl stock solution.

Plasmids, virus production, and infection of target cells
The pMXs-NF2-IRES-GFP construct was generated by inserting NF2
cDNA (complementary DNA) (Open Biosystems, MHS1011-202832561)
into pMXs-IRES-GFP retroviral vector (Cell Biolabs). Retroviral pack-
aging, infection, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were performed
as previously described (22).

FAK siRNA
A mix of four individual PTK2 siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus PTK2 siRNA;
Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific) was used for depletion of FAK in meso-
thelioma cell lines with DharmaFECT reagent as described in the “siRNA
Transfection with DharmaFECT Protocol.” siGENOME Non-Targeting
siRNA #1was used as a negative control.

Statistics
Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine whether the data
were normally distributed. Unpaired t test with Welch’s correction or
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statis-
tical significance of the results for normally distributed data sets.

Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine sig-
nificance of nonnormally distributed data. a = 0.05 (two-tailed testing)
was used for all statistical measurements. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with Prism 6 software.

Aldefluor assay, limiting dilution assay, immunofluorescence and
immunohistochemistry procedures, MoT, Western blotting and anti-
bodies, blocking antibody experiments, and mouse models are de-
scribed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
