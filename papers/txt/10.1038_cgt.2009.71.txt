Schwannomas are benign tumors forming along peripheral nerves that can cause deafness, pain and paralysis. Current treatment
involves surgical resection, which can damage associated nerves. To achieve tumor regression without damage to nerve fibers, we
generated an HSV amplicon vector in which the apoptosis-inducing enzyme, caspase-1 (ICE), was placed under the Schwann
cell-specific P0 promoter. Infection of schwannoma, neuroblastoma and fibroblastic cells in culture with ICE under the P0 promoter
showed selective toxicity to schwannoma cells, while ICE under a constitutive promoter was toxic to all cell types. After direct
intratumoral injection of the P0-ICE amplicon vector, we achieved marked regression of schwannoma tumors in an experimental
xenograft mouse model. Injection of this amplicon vector into the sciatic nerve produced no apparent injury to the associated dorsal
root ganglia neurons or myelinated nerve fibers. The P0-ICE amplicon vector provides a potential means of ‘knifeless resection’ of
schwannoma tumors by injection of the vector into the tumor with low risk of damage to associated nerve fibers.

Introduction

Clinical problem of schwannomas and current
treatment
Schwannomas are benign tumors derived from dediffer-
entiation and proliferation of Schwann cells, which
myelinate peripheral nerves. Tumors that form along
the vestibular nerve can lead to hearing loss and along
cranial and peripheral nerves to pain and paralysis. An
increased frequency of schwannoma tumors are found in
the hereditary conditions, NF21,2 and schwannomatosis.3
Currently, these tumors are treated by surgical resection,
which is not always complete and can cause nerve
damage. However, because these tumors are typically
benign, even reduction in volume can be beneficial.

Treatment strategies need to focus on reducing the size
of schwannomas, while sparing associated nerves.

Experimental models and therapies for schwannomas
Experimental schwannoma models to evaluate therapeu-
tic strategies have included use of a dominant negative
mutation in merlin under the Schwann cell-specific P0
promoter in transgenic mice and conditional knockout of
the NF2 gene-encoding merlin in mice crossed to
transgenic mice with Cre recombinase under the P0
promoter, both of which show spontaneous formation of
schwannomas along peripheral nerves.4 Other mouse
models include subcutaneous implantation of human
schwannoma tissue5 or human or murine schwannoma cell
lines6
into immune compromised mice. Experimental
therapies being explored include treatment with EGFR
antagonists2,7 and oncolytic herpes simplex virus vectors.5–7

HSV amplicon vectors for tumor therapy
Amplicons are a DNA-based vector system in which two
non-coding elements of HSV—the DNA origin of
replication and packaging signal—are used to package
plasmid DNA into HSV virions.8 These vectors transduce

schwannoma cells and other cell types very efficiently.5,6,9
Amplicon vectors have been tested extensively for
treatment of different experimental tumors by delivering
of pro-drug activating enzymes, apoptosis-inducing fac-
tors, fusogenic proteins and siRNAs for growth factor
receptors (for review).10,11 They have the advantages
of efficient transduction of many tumor types, good
promoter integrity, the ability to target infection to tumor
cells selectively,12 a large transgene capacity and low
inherent toxicity.8

Current study
Here, we evaluated the ability of an HSV amplicon vector
encoding an apoptosis-inducing protein, ICE (HGP0-
ICE-lacZ), under the Schwann cell-specific P0 promoter
to block growth of schwannoma tumors without injury to
associated neurons. Tumors were formed by subcuta-
neous injection of an immortalized human schwannoma
cell line13 and monitored by caliper measurements and
bioluminescence imaging of tumor-associated Fluc expre-
ssion. Nerve toxicity was evaluated after direct injection
of the amplicon vectors into the sciatic nerve followed by

Materials and methods

Cell culture
The HEI-193 human schwannoma cell line (from Dr Lim,
House Ear Institute) was established from an NF2
schwannoma patient, immortalized with human papilloma
virus E6/E7 genes13 and maintained in DMEM with 2 mM
forskolin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 14 ng ml–1 recom-
binant glial growth factor (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and
50 ml ml–1 gentamycin (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) (Figure 1a).
Human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (American Type
Culture Collection)15 was grown in DMEM/F12 (1:1)
(Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD).16 293T human embryonic
kidney fibroblasts (from Dr David Baltimore, MIT) were
grown in DMEM. For all cell types, growth media were
supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Cellgro) and cells were maintained at 37 1C
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.

HSV amplicon treatment of schwannomas
S Prabhakar et al

Vectors
HSV amplicon plasmids were derived from pHGCX,17
which carries an HSV origin of replication (oris) and
cleavage/packaging signal (pac); an expression cassette for
GFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) under the HSV
immediate early viral promoter, IE4/5 and an MCS
downstream of the immediate early CMV promoter. In
one version of the amplicon (pHGC-Fluc) sequences
encoding Fluc were placed downstream of the CMV
promoter.18 We also generated other versions of this
amplicon (pHGP0X) in which the CMV promoter was
replaced with the P0 promoter active in Schwann cells
from Dr Lemke).19 The CMV promoter in
(1.1 kb,
pHGCX was excised using BglII and EcoRI sites in the
MCS, and then the P0 promoter was ligated between
these sites. cDNAs for ICE-lacZ20 or lacZ (pVITRO3-
GFP/lacZ) were cloned into the MCS at the Not I sites to
generate pHGP0-ICE-lacZ (Figure 2) and pHGP0-lacZ
vectors. As a control, the ICE-lacZ transgene was also
cloned into pHGCX to generate pHGC-ICE-lacZ.
Amplicon vectors were packaged using the helper virus-
free system, as described,21 which typically generates
vector stocks with titers B108 tu ml–1.

Lentivirus vectors were generated using CSCW-IG, a
self-inactivating lentiviral vector, which has a CMV
promoter controlling expression of both transgene and
GFP cDNAs separated by an IRES element.22 The

Cancer Gene Therapy

cDNA-encoding Fluc a (pGL3-basic; Promega Madison,
WI) and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mCherry,
from Dr R.Tsien)23 were amplified by PCR. Fluc
sequences were inserted directly downstream of the CMV
promoter at the Nhe I site and mCherry sequences were
inserted in place of the GFP cDNA at Bsa I and Sal I sites,
generating pCSCW-Fluc-IRES-mCherry. Lentivirus vec-
tors were generated as described with a typical titer of 108–
1010 tu ml–1.22 To confer stable expression of Fluc and
mCherry on HEI-193 cells, they were infected with CSCW-
Fluc-IRES-mCherry lentivirus at an MOI of 50, which
gave 490% infectability (cell line termed as HEI-193-FC).

WST-1 assay
Viability was assessed using the cell proliferation reagent,
WST-1
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Penzberg,
Germany). Twelve hundred HEI-193, 293 T or SH-
SY5Y cells were plated into poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well
plates and infected in triplicate with HGP0-ICE-lacZ,
HGP0-lacZ or HGC-ICE-lacZ amplicon vectors at an
MOI of 5 to achieve 490% infection. After 72 h, media
was aspirated off and cells were incubated in 100 ml fresh
media containing 10 ml WST-1 reagent for 4 h under culture
conditions. The oxidized tetrazolium salt was measured in
wells at 420 nm using Spectra max Plus 384 spectro-
photometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).

In vivo schwannoma model
For the establishment of schwannoma tumors, 5 106
HEI-193 or HEI-193-FC cells were suspended in 100 ml
reduced serum media (Opti-MEM 1, Gibco), mixed with
100 ml of Matrigel
(BD Matrigel Matrix HC, BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and implanted subcutaneously
into one or both flanks of immunodeficient mice (nu/nu,
NCI). When tumor growth was apparent (B3–4 days
after the injection), tumor volumes were measured twice a
week with external calipers with the volume calculated as
(4p/3)(width/2)2(length/2).24 When the tumors reached a
size of 100 mm3 (baseline day 0),
the animals were
randomly divided into two groups of three animals each
per experiment. Tumors were injected at multiple sites
with 2 107 tu HGP0-ICE-lacZ or HGP0-lacZ diluted in
0.9% sodium chloride (1:3) (Abbott Laboratories, North
Chicago, IL) in a total volume of 120 ml over 5 min on
baseline days 6, 9 and 12 for the first experiment (HEI-193
cells; Figure 3) or 7, 10 and 13 for the second experiment
(HEI-193-FC cells; Figure 4).

In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Mice bearing HEI-193-FC tumors were anesthetized by
injection of a mixture of ketamine (25 g l–1) and
i.p.
xylazine (5 g l–1) and injected i.p. with 150 mg kg–1 body
weight of the Fluc substrate, D-luciferin. Ten minutes
after injection, signal was acquired for 10 s or 1 min using
a cryogenically cooled, high efficiency CCD camera
system (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), as described.25
Conventional white-light surface images were obtained
immediately before each photon counting session to
provide an anatomical outline of the animal. After data
acquisition, post-processing
and visualization were

to identify bioluminescent signals with intensities signifi-
cantly greater than background. The sum of the photon
counts in these regions was then calculated. At the end of
the experiment, tumors were removed, post-fixed overnight
and sectioned at 20 mm. GFP fluorescence was visualized
directly on perfused sections using a fluorescence micro-
scope. Tumors were stained for S100 using polyclonal
anti-cow S100 antibody (Dako, Glostrun Denman,
Carpinteria CA) and secondary antibody, as described.26

Evaluation of neuronal toxicity in DRG
HSV amplicon vector-encoding ICE-lacZ or lacZ under
the P0 promoter was injected into the sciatic nerve
of adult nude mice (107 tu in 1 ml) over an B10 s period
(6 per group). Seven days post-injection animals were
perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS under deep anesthesia, as described,6 and innervating
DRG (L4-6) on same side removed. DRG were post-fixed
for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected
overnight in PBS/15% sucrose. DRGs were sectioned at
10 mm and treated with blocking buffer (TNB blocking
reagent; Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 1 h, stained with the primary antibody for
ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, CA) diluted in the
blocking buffer 1:300 or GAP-43 (Chemicon Interna-
tional, Temecula, CA) 1:1000 at 4 1C overnight. After the
incubation, the sections were washed three times in PBS
and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6). The secondary antibody,
preabsorbed CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson
Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), was used at a
dilution of 1:300 in the blocking buffer for 30 min at room
temperature, then sections were washed three times in PBS
and mounted with fluorescent mounting media (Dako).

Nerve conduction velocity
The CV was measured 3 weeks after injection of vectors
(HGP0-lacZ, HGP0-ICE-lacZ, G47D) or saline, or with
no injection into the sciatic nerve fibers. Under pento-
barbital anesthesia (50 mg kg–1, i.p.), the sciatic nerve of
each treated and untreated mouse was exposed on the left
gluteal region. Two electrodes of stimulation and record-
ing were located, respectively, at the distal and proximal
part of the nerve around 8 mm apart. The stimulatory
electrode was connected to the stimulator (Model 2100,
A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) through the stimulus
isolator (Model 2200, A-M Systems). Intensity and
duration of the stimulus were optimized to supramaximal
threshold to induce the compound action potential. The
recording electrode was connected to the amplifier
MultiClamp 700B with digitizer 1322A (Molecular
Devices, Union City, CA). The signals of stimulation
and action potential were filtered and digitized at 2 and
10 kHz, respectively, and acquired, amplified and ana-
lyzed by Clampex 9.1 and Clampfit 8.0.27,28 The first and
second peaks after the stimulus peak regarded as the
action potentials transmitted by Aa, Ab fibers, respec-
tively. The latency time was measured as time difference
between the peaks of the stimulus and response. The CV
was calculated as CV¼ d/t
(d: distance between the
electrodes, t: time between the peaks of stimulus and

Infectability of schwannomas with HSV amplicon

cells
immortalized human
schwannoma HEI-193 cells were infected with an HSV
amplicon vector, HGC-Fluc-encoding GFP and Fluc at
an MOI of 1. Forty-eight hours later, cells were visualized
showing 495% infectability
for GFP fluorescence
(Figure 1a). For in vivo monitoring of gene transfer,
5 106 HEI-193 cells were implanted subcutaneously into
both flanks of nude mice. One week later, both tumors
were injected with 107 tu HGC-Fluc amplicon vector in
15 ml, and 24 h later, mice were imaged for Fluc activity
after i.v. injection of D-luciferin and acquiring photon
counts for 10 s using a CCD camera. Marked Fluc activity
was observed in tumors injected with HGC-Fluc vector
(Figure 1b). To confirm the extent of gene transfer, mice
were killed 48 h after the vector injection and tumors were
removed and stained by double immunofluorescence
for the Schwann cell marker, S100 and reporter protein,
GFP (Figure 1c and d). The tumor was positive for the
S100 as reported earlier6 and showed clear foci of GFP-
positive cells.

Specificity of P0 promoter for schwannoma cells

To evaluate the specificity of
schwannoma cells, different human cell types including
human embryonic kidney fibroblasts, 293 T, neuroblasto-
ma cells, SH-SY5Y, and schwannoma cells HEI-193 were
infected in culture at an MOI of 5 with HSV amplicon
vectors encoding the apoptosis-inducing protein ICE
fused to lacZ (HGP0-ICE-lacZ)20 or lacZ alone (HGP0-
lacZ) under the control of the Schwann cell-specific P0
promoter19 (Figure 2) or ICE-lacZ under the control of
the immediate early CMV constitutive promoter (HGC-
ICE-lacZ). Cell viability was assessed at 72 h post-
infection by using a WST-1 assay (Figure 3). The viability
of 293 T and SH-SY5Y cells was unaffected by transduc-
tion with HGP0-ICE-lacZ, whereas 80% of HEI-193 cells

were killed by this same vector, confirming the specificity
of the P0 promoter for schwannoma cells. In addition,
transduction with HGP0-lacZ did not cause loss of
viability of any cell type, whereas transduction with
HGC-ICE-lacZ reduced the viability of all cell types to
about 50% of naive cell values (Figure 3a). The more
extensive death of schwannoma cells with ICE-lacZ under
the P0 as compared with other cell types supports the
cell specificity of this promoter, eventhough the CMV
promoter gave higher levels of expression than the P0
promoter in schwannoma cells, as assessed by levels of
lacZ expression 24 h after infection with HGP0-lacZ vs
HGC-lacZ.

In vivo treatment of schwannoma tumors with
P0-ICE-lacZ amplicon vector
To evaluate whether the HGP0-ICE-lacZ amplicon vector
could be used to treat schwannomas in vivo, HEI-193 cells
were implanted subcutaneously in one flank of nude mice
(n¼ 6) and tumor growth was monitored over time by
caliper measurements. When tumor
reached about
100 mm3 in volume (6 days after implantation), half the
mice received an intratumoral injection of 107 tu HGP0-
ICE-lacZ vector, and the other half received 107 tu of
HGP0-lacZ control vector. Injections were repeated three
times at 3-day intervals (days 6, 9 and 12 post-implanta-
tion) and tumor size was monitored at 6-day intervals
over a 24-day period (Figure 3b). Tumors that received
the HGP0-ICE-lacZ vector stopped growing, whereas the
tumors injected with HGP0-lacZ continued to grow, with
the treated tumors being o1% the size of control tumors
on day 24 (Po0.02).

were then implanted subcutaneously (as above). Tumor
growth was monitored over time by in vivo biolumines-
cence imaging after i.v. injection of D-luciferin using a
CCD camera. At days 7, 10 and 13 post-implantation, one
set of mice (n¼ 3) received an intratumoral injection with
HGP0-ICE-lacZ (107 tu) and the other set (n¼ 3) received
107 tu of control HGP0-lacZ vector, as above. As
expected, tumors that received HGP0-ICE-lacZ decreased
in size by about 80% (Po0.002) by day 5 after the initial
injection, whereas control tumors continued to grow
(Figure 4). At day 16, the control group had to be killed
because of the large size of tumors. Tumors injected with
HGP0-ICE-lacZ vector started to grow again very slowly
by 25 days after the last vector injection.

Evaluation of toxicity of P0-ICE-lacZ amplicon vector to
neurons in DRG
To evaluate whether injection of the P0-ICE-lacZ vector
into nerve fibers would elicit a damage response in
innervating neurons from the DRG, we injected 107 tu in
1 ml HGP0-ICE-lacZ or HGP0-lacZ (over 10 s) into the
distal sciatic nerve of nude mice and evaluated neurons in
innervating DRG (L4-6) 7 days later by immunofluores-
cence. These neurons appeared to be slightly stressed by
injection of either amplicon or control vector, as indicated
by increased staining for ATF3 (Figure 5a and b) and
GAP-43 (Figure 5d and e) as compared with neurons
from the DRG of a non-injected control animal processed
in parallel, but this difference was not significant (Figure
5c and f). Thus, there is no indication of significant
toxicity to neurons caused by injection of the P0-ICE-
lacZ vector into the nerve fiber.

Discussion

Findings in this study
In this study, we show that it is possible to block growth
of an experimental schwannoma by direct injection of an
HSV amplicon vector expressing ICE under a Schwann
cell-specific promoter, while avoiding injury to associated
nerves. The experimental schwannoma tumor model used
has the advantage that the cells are of human origin from

an NF2 patient13 and maintain features of schwannomas,
including expression of S100.6 These cells have been
immortalized, as non-immortalized human schwannoma
cells rarely form tumors in experimental animal models
and those grow very slowly in vivo.5 The HSV amplicon
vector has the advantages of preserving the integrity of the
P0 promoter in a plasmid backbone with efficient delivery
to the nuclei of schwannoma cells mediated by the HSV
virion and low-to-no intrinsic toxicity. Thus, direct injection
of this vector into the schwannoma has the potential to
reduce tumor volume without damaging nerves.

Relationship to earlier studies
There are a number of mouse models of schwannoma
tumors available to test therapeutic agents. The dominant
negative merlin transgenic model has the advantage that it
mimics a mutation found in human schwannomas and
tumors form spontaneously along peripheral nerves.29,30
However, tumors form in a variety of locations over a
12-month period and must be localized by histology30 or
magnetic resonance imaging.26 These tumors also grow
slowly and at variable rates in the range of 0.1–0.3 mm3
per day.26,5 This limits the ability to carry out direct
tumor injections and monitor tumor growth responses to
treatment. A conditional NF2 knockout mouse line has
also been generated,31 and forms slow growing Schwann
cell hyperplasia/tumors at variable locations when mated
with transgenic P0-Cre mice,4 as well as meningiomas
when mated with transgenic mice expressing Cre recom-
binase under an arachnoidal cell promoter.32 Subcuta-
neous implantation of resected human schwannoma tissue
(obtained at surgery)
in immune compromised mice
results in formation of slowly, variably growing tumors
(increasing in volume by an average of 2.5-fold over a
month or about 7 mm3 per day).5,33 In contrast, injection
of immortalized HEI-193 schwannoma cells with Matrigel
subcutaneously results in reproducible growth of tumors
with about a 20-fold increase in tumor volume over 30
days (50–100 mm3 per day; this study),6 making this a
more amenable model for evaluating therapeutic inter-
vention, albeit these cells are immortalized to promote
tumor growth and thus grow more rapidly than other
mouse schwannoma models.

its

Several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the
effectiveness of an oncolytic HSV vector in schwannoma
tumor models. The oncolytic vector used, G47D, has
deletions in the viral genes for ribonucleotide reductase
and gamma 34.5, which restrict
replication to
proliferating cells, and for
ICP47, which provides
enhanced viral growth in tumor cells and increases
immune response to viral antigens.34 These properties
combined with the high infectability of schwannoma cells
with HSV virions makes G47D a promising therapeutic
candidate. Direct injection of this mutant virus into
spontaneous tumors in NF2 transgenic mice5 or im-
planted human schwannoma tissue and immortalized
schwannoma cells6 led to marked regression of tumors.
Oncolytic HSV viruses and the EGFR antagonist,
erlotinib, have also shown therapeutic efficacy in a
xenografts model of human malignant peripheral nerve

sheath tumors,7 with the latter drug showing variable
effectiveness in human NF2 schwannomas35 and HEI-193
in in situ model.36 Several oncolytic HSV vectors are in
clinical trials for cancer,37–39 thus, making this a clinically
feasible protocol. However, mutant viruses may elicit an
inflammatory reaction, which even if minor could be
damaging to nerves, and the slow rate of proliferation of
schwannomas limits the replication potential of these
oncolytic virus vectors.

Potential therapeutic implications
HSV amplicon vectors have a number of advantages for
gene therapy including a large payload (typically multiple
copies of the transgene/virion and a 150 kb capacity),8
regulatable transgene expression through promoters,
which are either drug regulated40,41 or selectively active
in tumors,41,42,40,43 with no replicative potential (being
lost with cell division), and little-to-no toxicity or
elicitation of immune responses.8 The P0-ICE amplicon
vector used in this
found to transduce
schwannoma cells efficiently, to restrict ICE expression
and cell death to schwannoma cells, and to have no
apparent toxicity to neurons in vivo. Three intratumoral
injections of this vector into schwannoma tumors formed
from implanted immortalized human schwannoma cells
produced a marked regression of these tumors. Given the
slow growth of schwannoma tumors in human beings,
this vector has the potential to reduced tumor volume
without surgical resection, thus reducing the chance of
nerve injury. The resumed growth of
tumors after
amplicon vector injection presumably reflects both the
fact that only a fraction of the tumor cells are infected and
that amplicon sequences are lost with successive cell
divisions. More effective treatment might result from
additional vector injections and use of an HSV/EBV
hybrid amplicon vector, which replicates episomally and
is distributed to daughter cells.44 However, the growth of
benign schwannomas in patients is slower than that of the
immortalized schwannoma cells used in this tumor model,
so regrowth should be proportionally slower in patients.
This mode of vector therapy would be most appropriate
in cases of vestibular schwannoma, which occur on the
VII cranial nerve at the junction of the CNS and PNS,
with increasing size leading to nerve compression and
deafness and with surgical removal sometimes leading to
further nerve damage and deafness.
