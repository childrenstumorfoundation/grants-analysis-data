The developmental course of cognitive deﬁcits in individuals
with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is unclear. The objectives of
this study were to determine the natural history of cognitive
function and MRI T2-hyperintesities (T2H) from childhood to
adulthood and to examine whether the presence of discrete T2H
in childhood can predict cognitive performance in adulthood.
We present cognitive and structural neuroimaging data from 18
patients with NF1 and ﬁve sibling controls assessed prospectively
across an 18-year period. Longitudinal analyses revealed a sig-
niﬁcant increase in general cognitive function in patients with
NF1 over the study period. Improvements were limited to
individuals with discrete T2H in childhood. Patients without
lesions in childhood exhibited a stable proﬁle. The number of
T2H decreased over time, particularly discrete lesions. Lesions
located within the cerebral hemispheres and deep white matter
were primarily stable, whereas those located in the basal ganglia,
thalamus and brainstem tended to resolve. Our results support
the hypothesis that resolution of T2H is accompanied by an
improvement in general cognitive performance, possibly as a
result of increased efﬁciency within white matter tracts.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common single-
gene disorders to affect the human nervous system, with a birth
incidence of at least 1 in 2,700 [Evans et al., 2010]. Although
characterized by skin lesions, cutaneous and plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas, and multisystem complications including optic pathway
tumors, scoliosis, and increased risk of malignancy [Williams
et al., 2009], the most common consequences of the condition
in childhood are cognitive impairment and learning disability
[Hyman et al., 2005]. Although the neurocognitive phenotype of

NF1 is quite variable, approximately 80% of children with NF1
experience moderate to severe impairment in one or more areas of
cognitive functioning, including attention, executive function,
visuoperception, and language [Hyman et al., 2005; Lehtonen
et al., 2012]. Cognitive and behavioral deﬁcits manifest in a variety
of ways, including academic failure due to intellectual impairment,
speciﬁc and generalized learning disabilities, attention deﬁcit-hy-
peractivity disorder as well as psychosocial maladjustment and poor
social skills [Hyman et al., 2006; Noll et al., 2007; Lehtonen
et al., 2012]. Very little is known about the natural history of
cognitive function from childhood to adulthood in patients with
NF1, with cross-sectional studies proving inconclusive. While some
indicate an increase in cognitive functioning in children compared
to adults with the condition [Riccardi and Eichner, 1986], others do
not [Ferner et al., 1996]. To date, only two longitudinal studies have

examined the natural history of cognitive deﬁcits in individuals
with NF1; one explored the growth curves of speciﬁc cognitive
abilities in 19 individuals with NF1 up to adolescence [Cutting
et al., 2002], while the other examined cognitive development up to
late adolescence/early adulthood in 32 patients with NF1 over an
eight year period [Hyman et al., 2003]. Longitudinal designs avoid
some methodological limitations of cross-sectional studies, such as
cohort effects, which can be misinterpreted as a change in cognitive
function over time. Both studies suggested that the pattern and level
of deﬁcit remained stable over time from childhood into at least
adolescence. Considering full brain maturation does not occur until
early adulthood [Giedd et al., 1999], it is important to longitudi-
nally examine the natural history of cognitive function in individ-
uals with NF1 from child to adulthood.

NF1 is also associated with focal areas of high intensity on T2-
weighted MRI (T2H); lesions that typically occur in 60–80% of
children with NF1 [Gill et al., 2006; Payne et al., 2010]. T2H
commonly occur in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem,
thalamus, and subcortical white matter and are thought to repre-
sent areas of dysmyelination or increased ﬂuid within the myelin
sheath. While the number, size, and intensity of T2H decrease with
age, this is limited to those occurring within the basal ganglia,
thalamus, and brainstem [Hyman et al., 2003; Gill et al., 2006].
Although studies have not reached consensus regarding the rela-
tionship between the presence or number of T2H and cognitive
impairment, there is evidence to suggest that T2H, particularly in
the thalamus, represent a signiﬁcant risk for cognitive impairment
[Denckla et al., 1996; Moore et al., 1996; Goh et al., 2004; Hyman
et al., 2007; Chabernaud et al., 2009].

Only one longitudinal study examined the natural history of
cognitive functioning and T2H from childhood into adulthood
[Hyman et al., 2003]. Patients with NF1 (mean age 12.6 years) and
11 unaffected siblings were prospectively followed over 8 years. The
current study extends these data by adding a third time-point,
10 years after the second assessment. We had three aims: (1) to
determine whether cognitive function is stable in individuals with
NF1 over an 18 year period, (2) to track changes in the number and
location of T2H over the last ten years, and (3) to determine whether
the presence of discrete T2H in childhood predicts cognitive
performance in adulthood.

cohort not recruited; 1 had died, 1 developed a left frontal menin-
gioma (removed in 2007), 7 refused to participate (two gave no
reason, ﬁve lived interstate/overseas) and 13 could not be located.
Of the 14 original controls, 5 were successfully recruited (2 males, 3
females); 5 could not be located, 4 refused to participate.

Detailed history and medical examination was performed on all
NF1 participants, the results of which are published elsewhere
[Oates et al., 2013]. For the current study, participants were
individually assessed on the Wechsler adult intelligence scale 3rd
edition (WAIS-III) [Wechsler, 1997]. Although full scale IQ
(FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) from the
WAIS-III are reported, only FSIQ was analyzed to reduce the
type I error rate. Participants with NF1 also underwent a cranial
MRI on a 1.5 Tesla GE Signa HDxt magnet system. Scanning
protocols for this and earlier time-points are reported elsewhere
[Hyman et al., 2003].

The location and type (diffuse vs. discrete) of T2H were inde-
pendently assessed by two experienced pediatric radiologists (KP
and NW), who were blinded to the medical and cognitive history.
Grading criteria have been described elsewhere [Gill et al., 2006]. KP
and NW also re-examined each participants’ second time-point
scan using the same assessment criteria, enabling direct comparison
of T2H across time-points. The study was approved by The Child-
ren’s Hospital at Westmead Human Research Ethics Committee
(08/CHW/74) and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

RESULTS

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study participants were original members of a cohort consisting of
40 NF1 patients and 14 sibling controls recruited in 1992 from the
multidisciplinary Neurogenetics Clinic at The Children’s Hospital
at Westmead, Sydney, Australia. All participants with NF1 had a
clinical diagnosis of NF1. The original recruitment procedures and
selection criteria are published elsewhere [North et al., 1994;
Hyman et al., 2003]. For the current study, eighteen NF1 patients
(6 males, 12 females) were successfully recruited from the original
cohort [Hyman et al., 2003]. Demographic details are presented in
Table I. The presence, number, and type of T2H were analyzed in
17/18 patients. MRI was not undertaken in one patient because she
was breastfeeding; a contraindication for use of contrast as pre-
scribed by our standard MRI protocol. Cognitive data were ana-
lyzed in 17/18 patients, with data from an additional patient

Shapiro Wilk and Kolmogorov Smirnov tests were used to assess the
normality of the data. Given the cognitive data were not normally
distributed, median and interquartile ranges (IQR) have been
reported. Median IQ scores across the three time-points are pre-
sented in Table II. Friedman test indicated a signiﬁcant difference
between FSIQ scores over time for the NF1 group, indicating IQ

improved with age in individuals with NF1 (P¼ 0.02). Mann–
Whitney U test indicated that while the FSIQ of the NF1 group was
signiﬁcantly poorer than controls at the ﬁrst time-point (P¼ 0.05),
this difference was no longer signiﬁcant at time-point 2 (P¼ 0.14)
or 3 (P¼ 0.45). FSIQ was stable over time for controls (P¼ 0.76).

In order to understand the impact T2H in childhood may have
on the natural history of FSIQ, the NF1 group was split into those

with (T2Hþ; n¼ 10) or without (T2H ; n¼ 6) discrete T2H in
1992 (see Table III). While FSIQ of the T2Hþ group signiﬁcantly
improved over time (P¼ 0.01), the T2H  group remained stable

group differences at time-point 2 (P¼ 0.16) or 3 (P¼ 0.22). Reli-

Examples of discrete and diffuse T2H and their change over time
can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the number and location of
T2H in 2000 and 2010. The total number of T2H decreased over the
past 10 years from 76 to 49. Greatest reductions were observed in
subcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia, brainstem, and
thalamus. At least one discrete T2H was present in 62% of partic-
ipants with NF1 at time-point 2; this had reduced to 37% of the NF1
sample by time-point 3. There was a marked reduction in the
prevalence of discrete lesions between time-points 2 and 3. While
14% became diffuse, 49% completely resolved (Fig. 3a). Lesions
identiﬁed as diffuse at time-point 2 tended to persist over time, with
only 21% completely resolved by time-point 3 (Fig. 3b). T2H that
remained in 2010 were mostly located within temporal lobe white
matter. The vast majority of these were diffuse; only two were
discrete. Previously identiﬁed lesions within the temporal lobe
white matter persisted over time in all but one patient, in whom
all three diffuse lesions resolved. There were three new discrete
lesions in two patients identiﬁed in 2010; one in the splenium and
two in right temporal lobe white matter.

DISCUSSION

The objective of this study was to extend our previous longitudinal
research into the natural history of cognition and T2H in individ-
uals with NF1 by adding a third time-point. Over the 18-year study
period, we found a signiﬁcant increase in the cognitive function of
patients with NF1. Improvements were limited to individuals with
T2H in childhood; patients without childhood lesions exhibited a
stable proﬁle. These data suggest that while the presence of T2H

may predict reduced cognitive performance in childhood, their
presence in childhood does not predict cognitive function in
adulthood. These results provide the ﬁrst direct evidence of a
relationship between T2H status in childhood and cognitive
changes in later life. That is, as the number of discrete T2H decrease,
there is an accompanied improvement in general cognitive perfor-
mance. This relationship is intriguing and given that T2H are
hypothesized to represent abnormalities of myelination [Sevick
et al., 1992], our data suggests that resolution (or partial resolution)
of these lesions may result in increased white matter efﬁciency,
signiﬁcant enough to produce a functional improvement in IQ.
Patients without T2H in childhood exhibited stable cognitive
performance, presumably because they had no lesions to resolve.
These ﬁndings are in keeping with cross-sectional evidence of an
improvement in cognition between childhood and adulthood
[Riccardi and Eichner, 1986]. They are also somewhat consistent
with previously published longitudinal data on this cohort. Hyman
et al. [2003] reported that while this cohort, as a whole, did not
demonstrate a signiﬁcant increase in cognitive performance at the
second time-point (2000), when the NF1 group was split into three
subgroups based on age (average ages of 9, 12, and 15 years in
1992), there was a signiﬁcant increase among older patients in the
sample (who were an average age of 23 years in 2000). Despite the
number of T2H decreasing for the younger groups, there was no
corresponding cognitive improvement at the second time-point. A
possible explanation of this pattern is a lag between the resolution
of T2H as observed on MRI and lesion resolution at the micro-
structural level; both of which are necessary for improvement in
cognition. It may not be until patients reach their early 20s that
microstructural/histological resolution occurs to the degree allow-
ing observable improvement in cognitive function. This hypothe-
sis is strengthened by evidence that abnormal microstructural
white matter changes persist in regions that once contained
T2H which have since resolved [Ferraz-Filho et al., 2012]. It is
important to note that our data appear to argue against a critical
time period after which T2H resolution cannot result in cognitive
improvement.

Signiﬁcant reductions in the number and intensity of T2H
continued from 2000 to 2010, consistent with the hypothesis
that
time [Gill
et al., 2006]. The total number of lesions reduced by 35%. While
there were equal numbers of discrete and diffuse lesions in 2000,
over 60% of discrete lesions had resolved or transformed into
diffuse lesions by 2010. Diffuse lesions were more likely to be stable,
with only 21% resolving. Apart from one patient, lesions within the
cerebral cortex were stable over the study period. The three new
lesions were located within temporal lobe white matter or deep
white matter. Our data continue to differentiate the developmental
trajectory of lesions found within the cerebral hemispheres and
deep white matter (stable) to those in the basal ganglia, thalamus
and brainstem (resolve) [Hyman et al., 2003]. This suggests that the
underlying pathology of cerebral lesions may differ from those in
subcortical tissue.

It is important to consider that the ﬁndings of the current study
are limited by the sample size and should be considered prelimi-
nary. The reduced power of our sample restricted the analyses that
could be performed, particularly with regard to examining relation-
ships between T2H location and cognitive performance. The
current study provides a platform for future research into the
progression of cognitive functioning in NF1. A large prospective
