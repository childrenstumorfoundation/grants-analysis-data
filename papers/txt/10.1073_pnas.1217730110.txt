Mutational activation of the Ras oncogene products (H-Ras, K-Ras,
and N-Ras) is frequently observed in human cancers, making them
promising anticancer drug targets. Nonetheless, no effective strat-
egy has been available for the development of Ras inhibitors, partly
owing to the absence of well-deﬁned surface pockets suitable for
drug binding. Only recently, such pockets have been found in the
crystal structures of a unique conformation of Ras·GTP. Here we
report the successful development of small-molecule Ras inhibitors
by an in silico screen targeting a pocket found in the crystal structure
of M-Ras·GTP carrying an H-Ras–type substitution P40D. The se-
lected compound Kobe0065 and its analog Kobe2602 exhibit inhib-
itory activity toward H-Ras·GTP-c-Raf-1 binding both in vivo and
in vitro. They effectively inhibit both anchorage-dependent and
-independent growth and induce apoptosis of H-rasG12V
–transformed
NIH 3T3 cells, which is accompanied by down-regulation of down-
stream molecules such as MEK/ERK, Akt, and RalA as well as an
upstream molecule, Son of sevenless. Moreover, they exhibit anti-
tumor activity on a xenograft of human colon carcinoma SW480
cells carrying the K-rasG12V gene by oral administration. The NMR
structure of a complex of the compound with H-Ras·GTPT35S, exclu-
sively adopting the unique conformation, conﬁrms its insertion into
one of the surface pockets and provides a molecular basis for bind-
ing inhibition toward multiple Ras·GTP-interacting molecules. This
study proves the effectiveness of our strategy for structure-based
drug design to target Ras·GTP, and the resulting Kobe0065-family
compounds may serve as a scaffold for the development of Ras
inhibitors with higher potency and speciﬁcity.
molecular targeted therapy | small-molecule inhibitor
Ras oncoproteins belong to the Ras family of small GTPases

and function as molecular switches by cycling between GTP-
bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms in intracellular sig-
naling pathways controlling cell growth, differentiation, and apo-
ptosis (1). Interconversion between the two forms, which mainly
involves the conformational changes of two ﬂexible regions called
switch I (residues 32–38) and switch II (residues 60–75), is re-
ciprocally catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (2). In particular,
GEFs such as Son of sevenless (Sos) mediate upstream signals to
enhance formation of the GTP-bound form. The oncogenic po-
tential of Ras is activated by point mutations mainly involving the
codons 12 and 61, which impair the intrinsic GTPase activity and,
moreover, render Ras insensitive to the GAP action, leading to
constitutive activation of downstream effectors such as Raf kinases
including c-Raf-1 and B-Raf, PI3Ks, and Ral guanine nucleotide
dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) family proteins (1). These

mutations are observed in about 15–20% of human cancers, and
speciﬁcally in about 60–90% and 30–50% of pancreatic and co-
lorectal carcinomas, respectively (1, 3, 4). Cancer cells carrying the
ras oncogene are known to exhibit a phenomenon called oncogene
addiction, where their survival becomes dependent on the acti-
vated oncogene function (3). Consequently, inhibition of the ac-
tivated Ras function has been shown to lead not only to reversal of
the transformed phenotypes but also to cell death and tumor re-
gression (4, 5). Despite their importance as an anticancer drug
target, there is no effective molecular targeted therapy for Ras at
present; the once highly anticipated farnesyl transferase inhibitors,
which inhibit the posttranslational lipid modiﬁcation, farnesyla-
tion, of Ras necessary for membrane targeting, have failed in
clinical trials (1, 6). Although farnesylthiosalicylic acid has been
reported to inhibit Ras by antagonizing its interaction with the
Ras-escort proteins, its antitumor activity remains unclear (7).

Although recent success in drug discovery using structure-based
drug design (SBDD) for AIDS and inﬂuenza has boosted hopes
for the application of SBDD to anticancer drug development, Ras
have been presumed refractory to this approach because they lack
apparently “druggable” pockets on their surface, as seen from
their crystal structures (1). Recently, by X-ray crystallography and
NMR spectroscopy we solved the tertiary structures of H-Ras, its
homolog M-Ras, and their mutants in complex with a non-
hydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate
(GppNHp), all of which corresponded to a unique conformation
(8–10) undergoing dynamic equilibrium with the previously known
conformation. Intriguingly, the structures possessed surface
pockets that seem suitable for drug binding. In this paper, we have
applied SBDD to target Ras·GTP by using the structural in-
formation on these surface pockets. We report the successful
discovery of a unique class of small-molecule compounds that have

Results
Discovery of Small-Molecule Compounds Inhibiting Ras–Raf Interaction
by SBDD. Aiming to discover small-molecule compounds ﬁtting
into the surface pockets of the unique conformation of Ras·GTP,
we applied the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzman surface
area (MMPB-SA) method with an Assisted Model Building and
Energy Reﬁnement (AMBER)96 force ﬁeld to carry out a com-
puter docking screen of a virtual library containing 40,882 com-
pounds based on the high-resolution (1.35 Å) crystal structure of
M-RasP40D·GppNHp (9). Ninety-seven candidates were selected
and examined in vitro for their activity to inhibit the binding of

M-RasP40D·GTP and H-Ras·GTP to the Ras-binding domain
(RBD, amino acids 50–131) of c-Raf-1. Only one compound,
named Kobe0065 (Fig. 1A), exhibited potent activity to competi-
tively inhibit the binding of H-Ras·GTP to c-Raf-1 RBD with a Ki
value of 46 ± 13 μM as estimated from the binding kinetics (Fig.
S1). A subsequent computer-assisted similarity search of ∼160,000
compounds based on the Tanimoto coefﬁcient selected 273 can-
didates, among which one positive, named Kobe2602 (Fig. 1A),
with a Ki value of 149 ± 55 μM (Fig. S1), was identiﬁed. These two
compounds, added to the culture medium at 2 and 20 μM, effec-
tively reduced the amount of c-Raf-1 associated with H-RasG12V in
NIH 3T3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the in-
hibition of the cellular activity of Ras (Fig. 1B). A rough estimate of
the IC50 value for the cellular Ras–Raf-binding inhibition was
around 10 μM (Fig. 1B), which was not much different from the Ki
values for the in vitro Ras–Raf-binding inhibition considering the

was also observed with NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing K-RasG12V
(Fig. S2).

Inhibitory Effects of the Kobe0065-Family Compounds on Various Ras
Signaling Pathways. We examined the effect of the compounds on
the cellular activity of Raf, which is dependent on its interaction
with Ras·GTP. Both Kobe0065 and Kobe2602 at 20 μM efﬁ-
ciently inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, down-
stream kinases of Raf in NIH 3T3 cells transiently expressing
H-RasG12V, although the effect was slightly weaker than that of
2 μM sorafenib (11), an inhibitor of multiple protein kinases
including Raf (Fig. 1C). However, they failed to inhibit the ki-
nase activity of c-Raf-1 measured in vitro (Fig. 1D), indicating
the absence of direct inhibitory activity on Raf. Furthermore, the
compound-treated cells showed substantial decreases of phos-
phorylated Akt and RalA·GTP, downstream molecules of PI3Ks
and RalGDS, respectively, in a manner dependent on the com-
pound concentrations (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the compounds
exerted inhibitory effects toward multiple Ras effectors through
inactivation of Ras.

We next examined the effect of the compounds on Sos. Sos has
two distinct Ras-binding sites: the GEF domain catalyzing the
GDP–GTP exchange on Ras through interaction with Ras·GDP
and the distal site allosterically accelerating the GEF catalytic
activity through interaction with Ras·GTP (12), and thereby
functions not only as a regulator but also as an effector of Ras. In
vitro GDP–GTP exchange assays using mSos1 and mSos1W729E,
carrying an inactivating mutation of the distal site (12), showed
that Kobe0065 at 50 μM almost completely abolished the accel-
erating effect of the distal site without apparently affecting the
catalytic activity of the GEF domain itself (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A),
suggesting that the compounds inhibited Ras·GTP but not
Ras·GDP. The IC50 value of Kobe0065 was estimated to be
around 20 μM (Fig. S3B). Kobe2602 also showed the same but
weaker activity with an IC50 value of around 100 μM (Fig. S3C).
This ﬁnding raised a possibility that the observed in vivo in-
hibition of H-RasG12V by the compounds (Fig. 1 C and E) might
be accounted for by the decreased Ras·GTP level owing to Sos
inhibition. However, we found that this was not the case, because
the cellular RasG12V·GTP level was almost unaffected by either
overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of mSos1 in ei-
ther NIH 3T3 cells transiently expressing H-RasG12V or human
colon carcinoma SW480 cells carrying K-rasG12V (Fig. 2 C and D).

Inhibitory Effects of the Kobe0065-Family Compounds on the Growth
of Cancer Cell Culture and Tumor Xenograft. We next tested the
effect of Kobe0065 and Kobe2602 on anchorage-independent
proliferation of H-rasG12V–transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The com-
pounds efﬁciently inhibited colony formation in soft agar in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A). The IC50 values
were around 0.5 and 1.4 μM for Kobe0065 (Fig. 3B) and Kobe2602
(Fig. S3B), respectively, which were comparable to the value of
2.1 μM observed for sorafenib (Fig. S3B). By contrast, the
compounds failed to inhibit colony formation of NIH 3T3 cells
transformed by the activated c-raf-1 gene carrying the S259A/
Y340D/Y341D mutations (Fig. 3C and Fig. S4A), whereas sor-
afenib exhibited potent inhibitory activity.

We then assessed the ras speciﬁcity of inhibition by using
several cancer cell lines carrying various oncogenes. The com-
pounds effectively inhibited the colony formation of cancer cells
carrying the activated ras oncogenes, such as SW480 and PANC-1
(K-rasG12V), EJ-1 (H-rasG12V), HT1080 (N-rasQ61L), and DLD-1
and HCT116 (H-rasG13D), but showed much weaker inhibition on
those without the ras mutation, such as A375, T-47D, LNCap,
BxPC-3, MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa (Table S1). DLD-1 and
HCT116 were sensitive to the compounds even though they
carried additional activating mutations in PI3K, suggesting that

activity pulled down by glutathione-sepharose resin was measured. Three
independent experiments yielded essentially equivalent results. (B) NIH 3T3
cells were transfected with pEF-BOS-HA-H-RasG12V in combination with
pCMV-mSos1 or siRNA against mSos1. H-RasG12V·GTP pulled down by GST-
c-Raf-1-RBD from the cell lysate was detected by an anti-HA antibody (Upper).
Total amounts of HA-H-RasG12V in the lysates was also measured (Lower). (C)
SW480 cells were transfected with pCMV-mSos1. K-RasG12V·GTP pulled down
by GST-c-Raf-1-RBD from cell lysates was detected by an anti-K-Ras anti-
body (Upper). Total amounts of K-RasG12V in the lysates were also mea-
sured (Lower).

the activated PI3K alone might be insufﬁcient to sustain their
anchorage independence. We next examined the effect of the
compounds on anchorage-dependent proliferation (Fig. 3D).
The compounds at 20 μM almost completely inhibited the pro-
liferation of H-rasG12V–transformed NIH 3T3 cells in the presence
of 2% FBS. The IC50 values were ∼1.5 and 2 μM for Kobe0065
and Kobe2602, respectively, which were a bit higher than that
(0.8 μM) for sorafenib (Fig. S4C). The compound-treated cells
exhibited frequent apoptosis (Fig. 3E), suggesting a contribution of
the oncogene addiction mechanism to the antiproliferative effect.
We next assessed the antitumor activity of the compounds by
using a xenograft of SW480 cells in nude mice. Daily oral admin-
istration of the compounds at the dose of 80 mg/kg caused ∼40–
50% inhibition of the tumor growth, which was weaker than the
65% inhibition by sorafenib (Fig. 4A). By doubling the dose to 160
mg/kg, the activity of Kobe0065 became more evident. During
these compound treatments the mice did not exhibit any signiﬁcant
body weight loss (Fig. S5). Immunostaining of the tumor sections
showed that the ERK activation was substantially compromised by
the compound administration (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the compound-
treated tumors showed a prominent increase of apoptotic cells (Fig.
S6A), suggesting a contribution of the oncogene addiction mech-
anism to the antitumor effect. In contrast to the case of sorafenib,
an antiangiogenesis effect was not observed (Fig. S6B).

Molecular Basis for Interaction of Ras·GTP with the Kobe0065-Family
Compounds. We used NMR spectroscopy to obtain structural
information on the compound-binding interface on Ras·GTP.

proximity to the side chains of Lys5, Leu56, Met67, Gln70, Tyr71,
and Thr74 of H-Ras (Fig. 5 A and B). These six residues formed
a hydrophobic surface pocket in the neighborhood of switch I (Fig.
S7A), indicating that the ﬂuorobenzene ring was inserted into the
pocket through hydrophobic interaction. However, the dinitro-
benzene moiety of Kobe2601 was located near switch II but not
tightly ﬁxed. Although direct assignment of the Kobe2601-
interacting residues on wild-type H-Ras was difﬁcult, measurement
of the backbone amide 1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum
coherence (HSQC) spectra of H-Ras·GppNHp revealed that
the resonances from Leu56, Met67, and their neighboring residues
underwent signiﬁcant chemical shift changes and line broadening
by the addition of Kobe2601 (Fig. 5C and Fig. S8), suggesting
sharing of a common binding pocket with H-RasT35S·GppNHp.

Superimposition of the NMR structure of the H-RasT35S–
Kobe2601 complex with the crystal structures of various Ras–
effector complexes (15–17) revealed that Kobe2601 overlapped
with the effector-binding interfaces (Fig. S7 B–E). As for c-Raf-1

agarose, and the indicated concentrations of the compound. After incubation
at 37 °C for 14 d, the number of colonies >200 μm in diameter was counted
under a dissecting microscope. (B) The IC50 value for Kobe0065 was estimated

were measured similarly as described in A. (D) H-rasG12V–transformed NIH 3T3
cells were cultured under a low-serum condition (2% FBS) in the presence of
the 20 μM compound. Each point represents the cell number relative to that of
the 0-h treatment. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM (A, n = 4; B,
n = 7; and C, n = 3). All experiments were performed in duplicate. One-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s test was used for the statistical analyses. *P < 0.001.
(E) H-rasG12V–transformed NIH 3T3 cells cultured in the presence of the
20 μM compound for 24 h in 2% FBS were subjected to staining with DAPI
(Upper) and the TUNEL assay for detection of apoptotic cells (Lower). A
representative image is shown for each group.

The NMR structure corresponding to the unique conformation
of H-Ras·GppNHp was determined by using only its T35S mutant
(13), because this mutation almost eliminated the slow confor-
mational exchange process (14), which made NMR analysis of the
wild-type protein impractical. Because of the low water solubility
of Kobe0065 and Kobe2602, which made measurements of the
NOEs impossible, we chose to use a water-soluble analog named
Kobe2601 (Fig. 5A), which had also been identiﬁed by the simi-
larity search of Kobe0065. Kobe2601 showed weak inhibitory ac-
tivity toward in vitro Ras–Raf binding with a Ki value of 773 ± 49 μM
(Fig. S1). NOEs between the benzene rings of Kobe2601 and the
side chains of H-RasT35S·GppNHp were detected and the
collected data were used for calculation of the tertiary structure of
the H-RasT35S·GppNHp–Kobe2601 complex (Tables S2 and S3).

compounds that bound to K-Ras·GDP and inhibited the Sos-
mediated nucleotide exchange both in vitro and in vivo. Their
crystal structure analyses of the complexes of the compounds,
benzimidazole (BZIM), benzamidine (BZDN), and 4,6-dichloro-
2-methy-3-aminoethyl-indole (DCAI), with K-Ras·GDP, K-Ras in
complex with guanosine-5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS), and
K-Ras in complex with guanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-methyleno]triphosphate,
respectively, provided a molecular basis for inhibition of the
Ras·GDP–Sos interaction but not the K-Ras·GTP–effector in-
teraction; the compounds apparently interfered with the binding of
K-Ras to Sos but not any effectors. In a sharp contrast, our com-
pounds exhibited a prominent inhibitory activity at both the
toward H-Ras·GTP and
biochemical and cellular
K-Ras·GTP and effectively interfered with the Ras–effector
interactions, although they also showed a sign of binding activity
toward H-Ras·GDP in the 1D 1H NMR analysis (Fig. S10).

levels

Although the residues whose interaction with BZDN and
DCAI detected by the HSQC analysis of H-Ras·GTP (19) showed
some overlap with those identiﬁed by our NOE analysis with
Kobe2601, a considerable difference existed in the location of the
binding pockets and the orientation of the compounds (Fig. S11),
which seemed to account for the difference in their ability to in-
terfere with the effector interaction (Fig. S7 shows the effector
interaction sites). Namely, the binding pocket for BZDN and
DCAI in K-Ras·GTP is located close to Asp54, whose side chain
forms a direct hydrogen bond with the NH group of BZDN,
whereas Kobe2601 is too far to establish any direct interactions
with Asp54. Sun et al. (20) also reported discovery of small-
molecule compounds inhibiting K-Ras·GDP, which showed
only the inhibition toward the Sos-mediated nucleotide exchange
in vitro and shared the binding pocket and the orientation of the
compounds on Ras·GDP with BZIM, BZDN, and DCAI. At
present, it is not clear whether Sos inhibition is an effective
strategy for suppressing the constitutively activated Ras mutants,
considering the great reduction of their GTPase activity and a vast
excess of free GTP over GDP in cellular concentrations. In this
regard, our results showing that the RasG12V·GTP level was al-
most unaffected by the mSos1 level (Fig. 2 B and C) indicated that
H-RasG12V escaped from the regulation by Sos. However, Sos
inhibition might be effective for some cancer types, considering
that the function of wild-type Ras is required for the growth of
tumors carrying the activated ras oncogene (21).

In conclusion, we found that the Kobe0065-family compounds
bind to Ras·GTP and exhibit antiproliferative activity toward
cancer cells carrying the activated ras oncogenes, by a strategy
based on SBDD. The compounds efﬁciently inhibit the in-
teraction of Ras·GTP with their multiple effectors including Raf,
PI3K, and RalGDS and a regulator/effector Sos and show rather
broad binding speciﬁcity toward various Ras family small
GTPases, which may account for their higher potency at the
cellular level compared with that of the in vitro binding inhibi-
tion. Although the inhibitory activity is not particularly potent at
present with the order of 10−6 to 10−5 M, the Kobe0065-family
compounds may serve as a lead scaffold for the development
of Ras inhibitors with higher potency and speciﬁcity and low
toxicity that are suitable for clinical application. For this pur-
pose, we would propose two possible strategies for structural
optimization: the addition of a functional group that gains a hy-
drogen-bonding or ionic interaction with the charged residues
such as Asp54 to increase the avidity and the avoidance of the

face model (switch I, yellow; switch II, green) and Kobe2601 is shown by
a space-ﬁlling model (C, black; O, red; N, blue; H, gray; S, yellow; and F,

Kobe2601. Stick representations of the residues giving intermolecular NOEs
(red), Kobe2601 (cyan), and GppNHp (magenta) are shown on the backbone
structure of H-RasT35S·GppNHp. (C) The residues that exhibited chemical shift
perturbation and line broadening in the presence of Kobe2601 (Fig. S5) are
shown on the crystal structure of H-Ras·GppNHp (PDB ID code 5P21). Mod-
erately perturbed residues with 0.01 ≤ Δδ < 0.015 and I/I0 ≤ 0.8, orange;
strongly perturbed residues with Δδ ≥ 0.015 and I/I0 ≤ 0.8, red; missing res-
idues or residues exhibiting resonance overlaps, cyan. The models were
generated using MOLMOL (27) and PyMOL (DeLano Scientiﬁc, LLC).

RBD (15), both the ﬂurobenzene and nitrobenzene moieties of
Kobe2601 were likely to cause steric hindrance with its surface
residues (Fig. S7B), supporting our observation of the competitive
inhibition by Kobe0065 and Kobe2602. Moreover, a major part of
Kobe2601,
including the thiosemicarbazide and nitrobenzene
moieties, was predicted to interfere with PI3K (16) much more
heavily than with c-Raf-1 RBD (Fig. S7C), which may account for
the efﬁcient inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). Likewise,
Kobe2601 was predicted to interfere with the Ras-interacting
domain of RalGDS (17) (Fig. S7D) and also more heavily with the
distal site of hSos (11) (Fig. S7E), which was experimentally
demonstrated in this work (Figs. 1E and 2A).

Because the residues forming the compound-binding pocket
are well conserved among Ras family members (Fig. S9), the
Kobe0065-family compounds were predicted to exhibit rather
broad speciﬁcity. This was indeed the case when various small
GTPases in their GppNHp-bound forms were tested for direct in-
teraction with Kobe0065 and Kobe2602 by relaxation-edited 1D 1H
NMR (18) (Fig. S10). The compounds bound efﬁciently to
M-Ras, Rap2A, and RalA but weakly to Rap1A compared with
H-Ras. As for Rho family small GTPases, both Kobe0065 and
Kobe2602 showed very weak, if any, binding activity toward Cdc42
and Rac1, whereas Kobe0065, but not Kobe2602, seemed to have
some binding activity toward RhoA. Also, we found that both
Kobe0065 and Kobe2602 bound to H-Ras·GDP as well in the 1D 1H
NMR analysis. This was rather unexpected considering no ap-
parent inhibitory effect of the compounds on the intrinsic GEF
catalytic activity of Sos (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). Interpretation of

lead to cellular toxicity.

Materials and Methods
In Silico Docking Screening. Structure-based screening was targeted at a surface
pocket of M-RasP40D·GppNHp (PDB ID code 3KKP) (9) surrounded by the two
switch regions and the nucleotide. The MMPB-SA method was used with an
AMBER96 force ﬁeld, where the solvent effect on binding free energy was
introduced upon simulation (22). A virtual library containing 40,882 com-
pounds (Namiki Shoji Co., Ltd., www.namiki-s.co.jp) was ﬁltered by application
of “Lipinski’s rule of ﬁve” for the selection of drug-like compounds, yielding
40,307 compounds to be screened. Upon docking simulation, the targeting
pocket was speciﬁed by amino acid residues located within a 6.5-Å distance
from the probe points, which were generated by referring to the position of
Asp67 (corresponding to Asp57 of H-Ras) in M-RasP40D·GppNHp. The initial 3D
Ras-compound docking structures and electric charges of the molecules in the
presence or absence of water molecules around a Mg2+ ion were calculated by
using Sievegene in myPresto software (23, 24) and Tripos software, respec-
tively. Candidates were selected based on the calculated docking free energy
values and the Nihon Electric Company’s original scoring functions.

Computer-Assisted Similarity Search. Approximately 160,000 compounds from
three libraries (Maybridge, Labotest, and Bionet) were described in the binary
ﬁngerprint format with some fragment-type topological descriptor such as
atom-pair descriptors (25). The Tanimoto coefﬁcient (26) between Kobe0065
and each compound was calculated and 273 compounds with a coefﬁcient
≥0.7 were selected as candidates.
