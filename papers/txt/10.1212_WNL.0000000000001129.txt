Mutations in LZTR1 add to the complex
heterogeneity of schwannomatosis

ABSTRACT
Objectives: We aimed to determine the proportion of individuals in our schwannomatosis cohort
whose disease is associated with an LZTR1 mutation.
Methods: We used exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and copy number analysis to screen
65 unrelated individuals with schwannomatosis who were negative for a germline NF2 or
SMARCB1 mutation. We also screened samples from 39 patients with a unilateral vestibular
schwannoma (UVS), plus at least one other schwannoma, but who did not have an identifiable
germline or mosaic NF2 mutation.
Results: We identified germline LZTR1 mutations in 6 of 16 patients (37.5%) with schwannoma-
tosis who had at least one affected relative, 11 of 49 (22%) sporadic patients, and 2 of 39
patients with UVS in our cohort. Three germline mutation–positive patients in total had developed
a UVS. Mosaicism was excluded in 3 patients without germline mutation in NF2, SMARCB1, or
LZTR1 by mutation screening in 2 tumors from each.
Conclusions: Our data confirm the relationship between mutations in LZTR1 and schwannoma-
tosis. They indicate that germline mutations in LZTR1 confer an increased risk of vestibular
schwannoma, providing further overlap with NF2, and that further causative genes for schwan-
nomatosis remain to be identified. Neurology® 2015;84:141–147

Schwannomatosis is a member of the neurofibromatosis family of neurogenetic disorders,
which predispose to benign tumors throughout the nervous system. Within this group, neu-
rofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis share clinical overlap and can be difficult to
distinguish, particularly in cases of mosaic disease.1 The main tumor type seen in both NF2
and schwannomatosis is the schwannoma, although the location of these tumors differs some-
what between these 2 syndromes, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas being almost uni-
versal
in patients with classic NF2,2,3 and with both intradermal and nonintradermal
schwannomas also frequently seen. In contrast, schwannomatosis-associated schwannomas
tend to be nonintradermal and nonvestibular, although rare cases of unilateral vestibular
schwannomas (UVS) have been observed.4 Both conditions also lead to meningiomas,
although there is a much higher incidence in NF2 (.50%) than in schwannomatosis

(approximately 5%).
In either disease,
meningiomas may be the only tumors that
develop.5–7 Ependymomas and cataracts are
also confined to individuals with NF2.2,3

Genetic characterization is an important tool
for distinguishing between diseases, because
germline mutation of the NF2 gene is reported
in more than 90% of individuals with nonmo-
saic NF2,8 but is not present in patients with
schwannomatosis, although somatically acquired
NF2 mutations are usually found in tumors.9
Germline mutation of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex gene, SMARCB1, is respon-
sible for approximately 20% of patients with
schwannomatosis disease, with a much higher
detection rate in familial patients (;50%) than
sporadic patients (;10%),10 indicating genetic
heterogeneity. Recently, leucine-zipper-like tran-
scription regulator 1 (LZTR1), which lies
approximately 3 Mb centromeric to SMARCB1
on chromosome 22, was identified as a second
causative gene for schwannomatosis, with loss of
function mutations identified in 80% of the
study’s SMARCB1 mutation–negative schwan-
nomatosis cohort, all of whom had somatic loss
of chromosome 22 in their tumors.11

We investigated the frequency of LZTR1
mutations in our own cohort of 16 families
with multiple affected members with schwan-
nomatosis and 49 individuals with sporadic
schwannomatosis and no known germline
SMARCB1 or NF2 mutations, with or without
known somatic loss of chromosome 22 in their
tumors, to determine the proportion of patients
with genetically uncharacterized schwannoma-
tosis whose disease is accounted for by this
new gene.

METHODS Patient material. We analyzed genomic DNA
from peripheral lymphocytes from familial and sporadic pa-
tients meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for schwannomato-
sis,12,13 who had previously tested negative for constitutional
in both NF2 and SMARCB1 genes using
mutations
Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) probesets P258-B1 and P044 (MRC-
Holland, Amsterdam,
the Netherlands).10 DNA extracted
from paraffin-embedded or fresh-frozen tumors was used to
confirm mutations and screen for second somatic mutations.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Ethical approval for use of anonymized samples from a
historical retrospectively collected archive in this study was ob-
tained from the North West 7–Greater Manchester Central
Research Ethics Committee (reference 10/H1008/74). Written
consent was obtained from prospectively collected individuals.

Exome sequencing. Whole-exome targeted enrichment and
sequencing were performed on lymphocyte DNA extracted from
7 unrelated individuals with a family history of schwannomatosis.
Enrichment was performed using the SureSelect Human All
Exon Kit v.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) for the Illumina HiSeq
2500 system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Sequence data were
mapped to the human reference sequence hg19 (build GRCh37)
with the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA v0.6.2).14 The genome
analysis tool kit (GATK v2.4.7)15 was used for base quality score
recalibration and indel realignment before variant calling using
the unifiedGenotyper. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
with $53 coverage and indels were annotated to genes using
Ensembl v68, and the functional consequences were defined.
Between 85% and 98% of the targeted exome was covered at
least 203 for each sample. Additional annotation was provided
from OMIM and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (35
species alignment) as well as population frequencies from 1000
Genomes Project (phase 1 release), NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project (v6500), and our own in-house frequencies. PolyPhen-2
and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) predictions were also
included to help determine pathogenicity. All
candidate
mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.

Sanger sequencing. Primers were designed to amplify each of
the 21 LZTR1 exons, including all of the coding regions and
approximately 50 to 100 bases of flanking intronic sequence
per exon. Each fragment was amplified by PCR, using the GoTaq
Green Master Mix (Promega, Southampton, UK). PCR products
were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). Sequencing was performed
using BigDye Terminator v3$1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Life
Technologies, Foster City, CA). Sequencing PCR products were
purified using Agencourt CleanSEQ beads (Beckman Coulter
Genomics) and sequence analysis was performed using the ABI
3730xl DNA Analyzer (ABI, Life Technologies).

Design and application of an LZTR1-specific MLPA
probeset. The genomic sequence of
the 21-exon human
LZTR1 gene
(NM_006767) was downloaded from the
University of California Santa Cruz genome browser (www.
genome.ucsc.edu). A total of 8 MLPA probes were placed such
as to target exons 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 18, and 20. Probes were
designed according to criteria provided by MRC-Holland at www.
mlpa.com. Seven reference probes targeting physically distinct
genomic regions were derived from previously established
probesets (unpublished). Oligonucleotides for MLPA probes
were
the Netherlands). MLPA
reactions utilized reagents from MRC-Holland, and products
were visualized on a LICOR4200 (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE). Relative MLPA signals were calculated as described
previously.16

RESULTS We undertook exome sequencing analysis
on lymphocyte DNA samples from 7 patients with
familial schwannomatosis who had previously been
found negative for germline SMARCB1 and NF2 mu-
tations. We identified novel heterozygous loss of
function mutations in the LZTR1 gene in 3 of these
patients (shown in table 1 and figure 1, A–C). The
mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and
segregated with all affected family members available
for testing (table 1). Of note, one clinically unaffected
father in family 2 carried a pathogenic mutation

(figure 1B). This may indicate nonpenetrance in this
individual, although he has not undergone full-body
MRI and may therefore harbor undetected tumors.
Sanger sequencing of probands from 9 additional
schwannomatosis
identified 3 further
germline loss-of-function mutations (figure 1, D–F).
Tumor DNA for 2 familial patients, in whom no
germline mutation had been detected, showed a
reduced signal for known SNPs on one allele in com-
parison to heterozygous signals in germline DNA on
sequencing chromatograms, suggestive of loss of het-
erozygosity (LOH).

We next sequenced LZTR1 in 49 patients with
sporadic schwannomatosis and identified 11 (22%)
additional germline point mutations (listed in table
1). Matched tumor DNA was available for 4 of the
mutation-positive patients and all showed evidence of
loss of the wild-type allele (table 1).

To determine whether larger single- or multiexon
deletions of LZTR1 were present in the samples neg-
ative for point mutations, we developed an MLPA
assay containing 8 probes spanning the LZTR1 gene.
Lymphocyte DNA of sufficient quantity and quality
was available to perform MLPA analysis on 9 familial
patients and 30 sporadic patients. The tumor from
the familial patient with an exon 7 missense mutation
and 4 tumors from mutation-negative sporadic pa-
tients were also tested.

No significant copy number changes were seen in
any germline DNA samples. Loss of the wild-type allele
was seen for the tumor from the patient with an exon 7
mutation. Three of the 4 tumors from sporadic patients
with no detected germline mutation showed a reduced
copy number of the entire LZTR1 gene at levels indi-
cating loss of one allele with some nontumor cell con-
tamination in the sample. The remaining tumor

showed no evidence of LOH. No point mutations were
identified by Sanger sequencing in this tumor.

None of the mutations identified in our cohort
were seen on dbSNP137 or on the ESP6500. The var-
iant c.2062C.T, identified in one individual in our
study, has been previously associated with schwanno-
matosis disease.11 In silico analysis of all the missense
mutations by PolyPhen2, SIFT, Align GVGD, and
MutationTaster predicted 5 of 8 different mutations
to be damaging to the protein by all 4 algorithms, 2
more were predicted to be damaging by 3 of 4 algo-
rithms, and one was predicted to be damaging by 2 of
4 and likely to be damaging by a third (table e-1 on the
Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org). This mutation
was also found in 2 unrelated individuals in our cohort
and was retained in the matched tumor, available for
one of these individuals, in conjunction with loss of the
wild-type allele, further suggesting that it is pathogenic.
Evolutionary conservation of the affected amino acids
(table e-1) shows that the missense mutations occurred
at conserved residues.

These results determine an overall detection rate
of LZTR1 mutations in 6 of 16 (38%) familial pa-
tients and 11 of 49 (22%) sporadic patients in our
cohort without germline SMARCB1 mutations.

None of the LZTR1 mutation carriers identified in
the schwannomatosis cohort had meningiomas, epen-
dymomas, intracutaneous schwannomas, or cataracts.
Two patients had facial nerve schwannomas and one a
lower cranial nerve schwannoma, which was initially

thought to be a vestibular schwannoma. Schwannomas
typically occurred at deep locations, including spinal
nerve roots with pain as the predominant symptom.
One individual with an inherited LZTR1 muta-
tion (family 1, table 1) had a schwannoma removed at
37 years of age, which was clearly identified at surgery
as emanating from the vestibular nerve during
cochlear nerve–preserving surgery in Germany.
Because of this result, we screened 39 additional lym-
phocyte samples from individuals with a UVS and at
least one additional schwannoma, but who had no
identifiable NF2 mutation in blood or proven mosaic
mutation in tumors. Tumors from 7 of these individ-
uals were also sequenced. Most of these patients met
Manchester criteria for NF2 with at least 2 nonves-
tibular schwannomas or meningiomas in addition to a
UVS.2 We detected germline mutations in 2 of these
individuals and one somatic mutation, not present in
blood,
in a third individual (table 1). The exon
1 frameshift mutation, c.27delG, p.(Gln10Argfs*15),
previously associated with schwannomatosis,11 was
identified in one of these individuals. This mutation
has subsequently been added to the Exome Variant
Server, seen in 59 of 11,848 alleles. It is difficult to
surmise that this mutation would not lead to total loss
of protein product by nonsense mediated decay, but a
mechanism for reinitiation of RNA sequence has
been described recently for SMARCB1.17 Two of
these last 3 individuals had a definite UVS whereas
the third had a cerebellopontine angle tumor

identified on MRI with a location consistent with
involvement of the eighth nerve (figure 2). In total,
LZTR1 mutations were identified in 3 of 39 individ-
uals (8%) with a UVS and at least one other schwan-
noma, but without a germline NF2 mutation.

The results of schwannoma tumor analysis from
patients with schwannomatosis without known NF2
mosaicism are shown in table 2. All 12 tumors from
SMARCB1 mutation carriers had the typical 22q loss
including LOH for NF2 and a point mutation. All 11
tumors from LZTR1 carriers had LOH, but in 4 cases
this was due to mitotic recombination. A substantial
proportion of patients with typical NF2 involvement
in their tumors, including 4 with typical different
NF2 point mutations in different schwannomas,
had no identifiable LZTR1 or SMARCB1 mutation.
Three of these patients whose lymphocyte DNA
showed no mutation of the LZTR1, SMARCB1, or
NF2 gene, had 2 tumors tested for somatic muta-
tions. None of these patients had 2 identical point
mutations in both tumors in any of these 3 genes.

DISCUSSION In contrast to the 80% of individuals
identified with a germline LZTR1 mutation in the

initial disease gene discovery publication linking
LZTR1 to schwannomatosis,11 we identified novel
in LZTR1 in only 26% of
germline mutations
our cohort of 65 patients with SMARCB1 mutation–
negative familial and sporadic schwannomatosis. Unlike
the initial report, we did not confine our analysis to
patients with proven involvement of the chromosome
22q locus. However, even in patients with 22q involve-
ment in tumor, but no proven NF2 or SMARCB1
mosaicism, we found only 28.5% with germline LZTR1
mutations. It is therefore likely that a further schwanno-
matosis gene exists on chromosome 22q.

Among the mutation-positive cases, we identified
both truncating and nontruncating mutations across
the length of LZTR1 (8 missense, 3 splice-site, 2
nonsense, and 4 frameshift), consistent with the
hypothesis that at least some of these mutations will
produce hypomorphic protein products similar to the
predicted
schwannomatosis-associated
SMARCB1 mutations.18

for a diagnosis of NF2, and 2 with a clinically uncer-
tain disease status because mutation analysis in NF2
was negative in DNA extracted from lymphocytes.
The identification of LZTR1 mutations in these in-
dividuals supports our previous assertion that UVS
can occur in the context of schwannomatosis,4 and
further suggests that LZTR1 mutations may confer a
greater
than
SMARCB1 mutations, because there have been no
reports of SMARCB1 mutation–positive schwanno-
matosis patients with a proven vestibular schwan-
noma. Vestibular schwannomas are still considered
exclusion criteria for schwannomatosis in published
criteria,12 although limiting this restriction to patients
with bilateral tumors has been proposed.19 In light of
our results, a UVS should not be considered an exclu-
schwannomatosis, and LZTR1
sion criterion for
mutation analysis should be considered in patients
with a UVS and other painful schwannomas, who
do not have other typical NF2 features, or a proven
germline or mosaic NF2 mutation.

The LZTR1 gene encodes a member of the BTB-
Kelch superfamily of proteins, exclusively localized in
the Golgi network. The cellular function of LZTR1 is
not clear, although mutations in this gene have recently
been implicated in the development of glioblastomas.20
LZTR1 lies on chromosome 22, approximately 3 meg-
abases centromeric to SMARCB1 and 9 megabases
centromeric to NF2. Three patients whose lymphocyte
DNA showed no mutation of the LZTR1, SMARCB1,
or NF2 gene had 2 tumors tested for somatic muta-
tions (a fourth had no DNA left for LZTR1 analysis).
One of these patients has been reported previously to
have LOH at the NF2 locus in one tumor without a
change in copy number, resulting from mitotic recom-
bination and with a breakpoint occurring downstream

146

Neurology 84 January 13, 2015

of both LZTR1 and SMARCB1.21 None of these 3
patients had identical mutations in both tumors in
any of the 3 genes. This shows that the schwannomas
in these patients are not due to mosaic disease caused
by any of the 3 genes and suggests that there are further
causative genes still to be identified.

In the context of our analysis, we present a flow
diagram of the ideal screening protocol for mutation
analysis of schwannoma disease, assuming availability
of relevant samples (figure 3). This will evolve as fur-
ther genes are discovered and sequencing of panels of
genes relevant to schwannoma disease become avail-
able and in time exome and/or genome sequencing
become routine first-line diagnostics. Currently, we
would recommend that next-generation sequencing
panels for patients with NF2 without bilateral vestib-
ular schwannoma and those with schwannomatosis
should include the NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1
genes for both blood and tumor analysis and that,
where possible, 2 tumors should be analyzed from
patients with no known family history.
