Abstract

Background: Attitudes regarding non-operative treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) may be changing with
the publication of BRAiST. Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) are used to treat AIS, but high-quality
evidence is limited. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitudes of members of the Scoliosis Research Society
towards PSSE.
Methods: A survey was sent to all SRS members with questions on use of Physical Therapy (PT) and PSSE for AIS.
Results: The majority of the 263 respondents were from North America (175, 67 %), followed by Asia (37, 14 %) and
Europe (36, 14 %). The majority of respondents (166, 63 %) prescribed neither PT nor PSSE, 28 (11 %) prescribed both
PT and PSSE, 39 (15 %) prescribe PT only and 30 (11 %) prescribe PSSE only. PT was prescribed by 67 respondents, as
an adjunct to bracing (39) and in small curves (32); with goals to improve aesthetics (27) and post-operative outcomes
(25). Of the 196 who do not prescribe PT, the main reasons were lack of evidence (149) and the perception that PT had
no value (112).
PSSE was prescribed by 58 respondents. The most common indication was as an adjunct to bracing (49) or small
curves (41); with goals to improve aesthetics (36), prevent curve progression (35) and improve quality of life (31). Of the
respondents who do not prescribe PSSE, the main reasons were lack of supporting research (149), a perception that
PSSE had no value (108), and lack of access (63). Most respondents state that evidence of efficacy may increase the role
of PSSE, with 85 % (223 of 263) favoring funding PSSE studies by the SRS.
Conclusion: The results show that 22 % of the respondents use PSSE for AIS, skepticism remains regarding the benefit
of PSSE for AIS. Support for SRS funded research suggests belief that there is potential benefit from PSSE and the best
way to assess that potential is through evidence development.

Background
Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercise (PSSE) has
been advocated as a potentially valuable tool in the treat-
ment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) [1–11].
Postulated treatment effects include preventing curve
progression, minimizing respiratory dysfunction, pre-
venting spinal pain syndromes, and improving aesthetics

via postural correction [1–11]. These treatment effects may
lead to avoidance of brace treatment or surgery [12, 13].
PSSE is also commonly used in conjunction with brace
treatment, and is suggested to increase the efficacy of bra-
cing [14–16]. In general, the role of PSSE is more widely ac-
cepted in Europe versus North America.

The evidence-base supporting PSSE treatment regimen
is very limited, as most of the published literature con-
sists of case studies and small cohort studies. A system-
atic review in 2012 identified only 12 relevant studies
and described the evidence as poor quality because all

were at level IV or lower in terms of their Level of Evidence
[6, 9]. This deficiency is due in part to inconsistent indica-
tions for PSSE treatment, the diversity of therapy programs,
ranging from outpatient postural training to intensive and
prolonged in-patient regimens, and the difficulty in assur-
ing compliance when patients are receiving therapy over an
extended period. The best available literature, is a recent
published randomized clinical trial of 110 patients that
demonstrates PSSE to be superior to standard physical
therapy (PT) in patients older than 10 years with small AIS
curves (10° to 25°) and Risser sign <2 [5].

Despite limited high quality evidence, the possibility of
effective nonsurgical treatment for AIS is obviously at-
tractive. Although U.S. surgeons have historically been
skeptical regarding the role of these conservative exercise
treatment options, attitudes may be changing. Publication
of the BRAiST study, which demonstrated efficacy of bra-
cing for AIS based upon clearly defined clinical parame-
ters [17], has encouraged both patients and surgeons to
the potential for brace treatment. At least in the public
sector, this interest seems to extend beyond bracing to en-
compass a wider array of nonsurgical options.

The purpose of this study is to explore the attitudes of
scoliosis surgeons regarding Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis
Specific Exercise (PSSE). Beyond questions of awareness
and acceptance, we sought to determine whether sur-
geons believe that evidence development regarding PSSE
was an important research priority.

Methods
After receiving Institutional Board Approval, a web-
based survey was sent to all 1200 Active and Candidate
members of the Scoliosis Research Society. The survey
(Table 1) included questions regarding membership status,
training and years in practice. For the respondents who
prescribe standard PT or PSSE, their indications and goals
for standard PT and PSSE were queried. For those who do
not prescribe standard PT or PSSE, they were further
queried on why they do not prescribe standard PT or
PSSE. In addition, respondents were asked if they have ob-
served an increased interest in PSSE, what evidence of this
they have observed, and if they anticipate an increased role
for PSSE in the future. All analysis was performed using
PASW Statistics GradPack 17.0 (Chicago, IL: SPSS Inc.).
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine difference in re-
sponses between regions of practice, years in training and
type of training.

Results
There were a total of 266 respondents (22 %). Three
were excluded from the analysis as they indicated that
that they did not treat AIS patients, leaving 263 respond-
ent surveys available for analysis. The majority of re-
spondents (175, 67 %) were from North America, with

an almost equal number from Asia (37, 14 %) and Europe
(36, 14 %), a small number of surgeons from South
America and the Middle East.

Almost all the respondents were Orthopedic Surgeons;
159 (60 %) categorized their spinal deformity training
primarily as Orthopedic Spine and 95 (36 %) as Pediatric
Orthopedics. Clinical experience, measured by years in
practice, was almost equally represented, with most
(110, 42 %) in practice for more than 20 years, 81 (31 %)
have been in practice between 11 and 20 years and 69
(26 %) have been in practice for ten years or less.

The majority of respondents (166, 63 %) prescribed
neither PT nor PSSE, 28 (11 %) prescribed both PT and
PSSE, 39 (15 %) prescribe PT only and 30 (11 %) pre-
scribe PSSE only. Sixty-seven (25 %) surgeons prescribe
standard PT for their patients with AIS. Although the re-
ported use of standard PT was more common in Europe,
there was no statistically significant difference in pre-
scribing pattern based on region, with an almost equal
proportion of surgeons in Asia, South America and
North America. There was no statistically significant dif-
ference in prescribing pattern based on years in practice,
or training (Table 2).

Among the 67 surgeons who prescribe standard PT,
the most common indication was the use of standard PT
in conjunction with brace treatment (58 %), small curves
(48 %) or post-operatively (Table 3). Only 25 % of sur-
geons prescribed PT for treatment of pain. However, al-
leviation of pain was chosen as the most common goal
of therapy (72 %). Improving aesthetics (40 %) and im-
proving post-operative outcomes (37 %) were the next
most common goals of standard PT. Of the 196 (75 %)
surgeons who do not refer AIS patients for standard PT,
the majority (149, 76 %) stated the lack of supporting re-
search as the most common reason, followed by the per-
ception that standard PT had no value in the treatment
of AIS (112, 57 %).

Fifty-eight (22 %) surgeons reported referring their
AIS patients for PSSE. There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in referral pattern based on region or
surgical training. Surgeons in practice for ten years or
less were less likely to refer for PSSE compared to sur-
geons who have been in practice for a longer period of
time (Table 4).

Among the 58 surgeons who refer patients for PSSE,
the most common indication was similar to standard
PT: in conjunction with brace treatment (84 %) or for
small curves (72 %) (Table 5). However, unlike standard
PT, PSSE was less often prescribed for treatment of pain
(3 %). Consistent with the respondents indication for re-
ferral, stated goals for PSSE were most commonly to im-
prove aesthetics (62 %), to prevent curve progression
(60 %) and to improve quality of life (53 %). The most
common specific PSSE used was Schroth (33, 57 %),

For the 204 (78 %) of surgeons who do not refer for

Treatment effectiveness of nonsurgical

for AIS remains under studied [18–20], with contra-
dictory recommendations from research studies [2, 8,
20] and insufficient evidence to guide treatment. Spe-

lent in Europe [1], have not been considered effective

[20] have recognized the lack of evidence supporting
exercise treatment. The SRS funded a pilot study of
PSSE, which resulted in a current RCT ongoing in
Canada comparing standard PT to PSSE in adolescent
scoliosis patients at a single center [21]. Despite a
steady increase in the discussion surrounding PSSE,
the view of PSSE among spinal deformity surgeons re-
mains largely unknown. This study reports on survey
results from 263 spinal deformity surgeons, relating to
their opinions and attitudes concerning exercise treat-
ment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS).

Reflective of the lack of strong evidence to support
PT or PSSE to treat AIS, the majority (63 %) of re-
spondents prescribed neither. Of those prescribing PT
or PSSE, the number prescribing either or both was
similar. In addition, despite the impression that PT
and PSSE are more widely used in Europe [7–9, 15,
19, 20, 22] compared to North America, our study
showed that there was no difference in prescribing
patterns among the respondents based on region.

Lack of exposure/experience

Although, there was no difference in prescribing pat-
tern for standard PT based on the surgeon’s years in
practice, older surgeons were more likely to prescribe
PSSE. PSSEs were developed in an era where clinical
traditions and methods were passed on [23], unlike
today where knowledge is spread through rigorous
study design and publication of findings. Thus, sur-
geons who have been in practice longer may have had
more exposure to PSSEs.

Consistent with current clinical indications, the ma-
jority of the respondents prescribe PT and PSSE for small
curves [7, 20, 22] and as an adjunct to brace treatment
[14–16]. Current guidelines recommend PSSE in curves
less than 25° to avoid bracing by stabilizing the spine,
and obtaining 3D autocorrection of the spine, pelvis
and rib cage [20]. Twenty-five degrees is the generally
accepted threshold at which brace treatment is recom-
mended [20, 24] Although 25 % of surgeons prescribed
PT for treatment of pain; alleviation of pain was chosen
as the most common goal of therapy, and only 3 % pre-
scribed PSSE for pain. This may illustrate some confu-
sion regarding the benefits of exercise in the AIS
population.

Despite an increased patient awareness of nonsurgical
treatments for AIS, the majority of surgeons do not pre-
scribe PT or PSSE. Respondents stated that they did not
refer AIS patients for standard PT or PSSE as they felt
that these treatments were of no value in AIS and that
there was no supporting research. Recognizing this

need, there was an overwhelming response that there
was a need for better evidence demonstrating efficacy
and most favored funding PSSE research using SRS re-
search dollars.

There are limitations to this study, foremost of which is
the relatively small number of respondents at 22 %. This
may raise the possibility of selection bias in that only sur-
geons with a specific interest in the non-operative treat-
ment of AIS may have responded. Yet a substantial number
of respondents indicated that they do not prescribe either

PT or PSSE. Still, this is a starting point in initiating the dis-
cussion on the need for a more robust study on the effect-
iveness of either PT or PSSE in the treatment of AIS.

While effective nonsurgical treatment for AIS would rep-
resent an important benefit for many patients, demonstra-
tion of treatment efficacy has generally proven difficult.
However, the success of the BRAiST study has created a
renewed focus on the potential for other nonsurgical treat-
ments, and an increased optimism that nonsurgical treat-
ments may be effectively studied. The results of this survey
demonstrate significant skepticism regarding the benefit of
either standard PT or PSSE in the management of AIS,
which is to be expected given the lack of evidence. On the
other hand, the fact those spinal deformity surgeons indi-
cated overwhelming support for SRS funded research sug-
gests a belief that at least some patients might benefit from
PSSE treatment. It certainly indicates a growing under-
standing among SRS surgeons that evidence development
is the optimal way to answer these important questions.

The results of this survey show that 22 % of the re-
spondents use PSSE for AIS, although skepticism re-
mains regarding the benefit of PSSE for AIS. Support for
SRS funded research suggests belief that there is poten-
tial benefit from PSSE and the best way to assess that
potential is through evidence development.
