Abstract

Background: Schwannomatosis is a disease characterized by multiple non-vestibular schwannomas. Although
biallelic NF2 mutations are found in schwannomas, no germ line event is detected in schwannomatosis patients. In
contrast, germline mutations of the SMARCB1 (INI1) tumor suppressor gene were described in familial and sporadic
schwannomatosis patients.
Methods: To delineate the SMARCB1 gene contribution, the nine coding exons were sequenced in a series of 56
patients affected with a variable number of non-vestibular schwannomas.
Results: Nine variants scattered along the sequence of SMARCB1 were identified. Five of them were classified as
deleterious. All five patients carrying a SMARCB1 mutation had more multiple schwannomas, corresponding to
10.2% of patients with schwannomatosis. They were also diagnosed before 35 years of age.
Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with schwannomas have a significant probability of carrying a
SMARCB1 mutation. Combined with data available from other studies, they confirm the clinical indications for
genetic screening of the SMARCB1 gene.

Background
Neurofibromatoses (NF) are an heterogeneous group of
genetic disorders predisposing to various tumors of the ner-
vous system, divided into two well recognized distinct clini-
cal entities, NF1 and NF2. Patients with multiple non-
vestibular schwannomas have been assembled into a parti-
cular category within neurofibromatoses called schwanno-
matosis [1]. The SMARCB1 gene has been found to harbor
germline alterations in both familial and sporadic schwan-
nomatosis patients [2,3], with a greater number of spinal
schwannomas in familial cases and the presence of menin-
giomas [4] although this latter point remains debated [5].
To improve the clinical indications for SMARCB1 molecu-
lar screening in medical genetics practice, we evaluated its
implication in a series of patients exhibiting non-vestibular
schwannomas and no NF2 germline alteration.

Methods
From 1992 to 2006, 303 patients were referred from the
French outpatient genetic clinics for point mutations

and genomic rearrangements analysis of the NF2 gene
to investigate the presence of schwannomas. All patients
or legal representatives signed an informed consent for
genetic analyses related to their disease according to the
French law (Public Health Code, article R145-15-4). No
specific consent was required for the present study, as
the SMARB1 analysis is part of the genetic tests pro-
posed to patients affected with schwannomas. Analyses
were performed in a laboratory labeled by the French
Biomedicine Agency ABM (lab no. 2008-gen-01). A sub-
group of 56 cases exhibiting non-vestibular schwanno-
mas as confirmed by MRI examination at time of
diagnosis were selected for SMARCB1 point mutations
screening. Medical reports were collected (number and
localization of schwannomas, age at diagnosis and family
history). Exons and splicing junctions of the SMARCB1
gene (NM_003073, NG_009303.1) were analyzed by
sequencing using the SeqScape software (Applied Bio-
systems, Courtaboeuf France) after PCR amplification
(Table 1). Functional consequence of intronic variants
was evaluated using NetGene2, GeneSplicer and a
splice-site model that accounts for adjacent and nonad-
jacent pair wise dependencies MaxEnt.

Results
Thirty-one females and 25 males were included in the
study. The age of onset ranged from 2 to 70 years. Six
patients had a single schwannoma, 11 patients had 2 to
7 and 39 patients more than 10 schwannomas. Two
patients had a positive family history. Nine different
sequence variants scattered along the sequence of
SMARCB1 were found (Table 2). Three were present in
12 patients, 10 in a heterozygous and two in a homozy-
gous state indicating a complete linkage disequilibrium
(Fisher exact test, p < 10-6). Two of them were present
in dbSNP as rs2229354 (c.897G > A) and rs5030613
(c.1119-41G > A); the third change (c.1149-41G > A)
was also considered as a polymorphism. The remaining
6 variants were unique: c.30del, c.34C > T and c.832C >
T were expected to truncate the protein; c.500+5G > T
was predicted to suppress the donor splicing site of
exon 4, leading to p.Arg121_Cys167delinsSer and lack-
ing the DNA-binding domain. Using the MaxEnt pro-
gram, maximum entropy of -5.62 was computed
compared to 0.87 with the normal sequence. Consider-
ing the existence of a rare long isoform, as a 51-bp
extension at the 3’ end of exon 4, this variant also
encoded c.505G > T was expected to produce a p.
Gly169X truncated protein lacking the two highly con-
served regions Rpt1 and Rpt2 and the coiled-coil

domain. The variant c.971_978delinsTGCTACCT impli-
cated the highly conserved Lys324 and Tyr326 amino-
acids, Tyr326 being involved in the coiled-coil domain
and possibly in the nuclear localization signal and/or the
binding of Akt. All five were considered deleterious. The
transversion c.501-23T > G was not predicted to affect
splicing using NetGene2 and GeneSplicer and was clas-
sified as not responsible for the disease. All five patients
carrying a SMARCB1 mutation were sporadic patients
diagnosed before 35 years of age with multiple non-ves-
tibular schwannomas.

Discussion and conclusions
Five mutations were identified through the analysis of
the SMARCB1 gene for point mutations in a series of 56
NF2-negative patients affected with non-vestibular
schwannomas. Patients carrying a mutation presented
with multiple schwannomas at a young age, i.e. 10.2% in
schwannomatosis patients [6] and 20% of patients diag-
nosed before 35 years of age, none with any family his-
tory of schwannomas. This proportion remains lower
than that described in familial schwannomatosis [3,7,8];
however neither somatic mosaicisms nor genomic rear-
rangements were investigated [2,7]. Tumor samples
were not available thus precluding dosage analyses and
the demonstration of SMARCB1 and/or NF2 somatic
inactivation [3].

Schwannomatosis is a rare condition characterized by
the development of multiple schwannomas and the lack
of vestibular nerve involvement. As germline SMARCB1
mutations have never been reported in cases of vestibu-
lar schwannomas, the presence of multiple non-vestibu-
lar schwannomas appears a good criterion to first
investigate the SMARCB1 gene, as reported through sev-
eral studies (Table 3). From our study, as mutations
were found in patients diagnosed before 35 years of age,
this aspect might also be considered to enlarge the
SMARCB1 analysis first to the search for genomic rear-
rangements and somatic mosaicisms and second to the
NF2 gene screening. On the other hand, the presence of
