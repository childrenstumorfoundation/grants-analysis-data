Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor syndrome characterized by bilateral
vestibular schwannomas (VS) which often result in deafness despite aggressive management.
Meningiomas, ependymomas and other cranial nerve and peripheral schwannomas are also
commonly found in NF2 and collectively lead to major neurologic morbidity and mortality.
Traditionally, the overall survival rate in patients with NF2 is estimated to be 38% at 20 years

from diagnosis. Hence, there is a desperate need for new, effective therapies. Recent progress in
understanding the molecular basis of NF2 related tumors has aided in the identification of
potential therapeutic targets and emerging clinical therapies. In June 2010, representatives of the
international NF2 research and clinical community convened under the leadership of Drs. D.
Gareth Evans (University of Manchester) and Marco Giovannini (House Research Institute) to
review the state of NF2 treatment and clinical trials. This manuscript summarizes the expert
opinions about current treatments for NF2 associated tumors and recommendations for advancing
therapies emerging from that meeting. The development of effective therapies for NF2 associated
tumors has the potential for significant clinical advancement not only for patients with NF2 but for
thousands of neuro-oncology patients afflicted with these tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor disorder that
causes multiple tumor types to form at every level of the nervous system. Although a rare
disorder (estimated 1 in 25–33,000 births) [Evans et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2010], the tumor
types seen in NF2 are among the most common in neuro-oncology (Fig 1). The hallmark of
NF2 is bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) which progressively enlarge leading to
sensorineural hearing loss and deafness [Evans, 2009]. VS may also cause brainstem
compression resulting in severe neurologic morbidity and mortality. Half of all individuals
with NF2 will also develop intracranial meningiomas and 75% will develop spinal tumors
including schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas [Evans, 2009]. The vast majority
of individuals with NF2 require surgery, and most will have multiple procedures during their
lifetime. The progression of NF2 and requisite surgical intervention can result in deafness,
facial palsy, blindness, seizures and hemiparesis.

Until recently there were few therapeutic options for individuals with NF2. Thankfully
things have progressed with increasing understanding of the genetic basis of NF2, as well as,
emerging molecular parallels within various cancers for which drug therapies are in
development or already clinically available. Nevertheless challenges lie ahead for the NF2
community, including prioritizing candidate drugs, managing patient recruitment to clinical
trials and integrating new therapies into clinical care across multiple surgical and medical
disciplines. This article summarizes the latest recommendations for NF2 clinical
management; advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of this disorder; and
progress made to date in implementing NF2 clinical trials.
CURRENT CLINICAL CARE STANDARDS FOR NF2
Surgical Management of NF2 Vestibular Schwannoma

Idiopathic VS are fairly common, with roughly 3,000 new cases per year in the United
States, with growing incidence in recent years [Evans et al., 2005]. These tumors cause
unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance. The primary treatment modality for these
tumors is surgical resection or increasingly, radiosurgery, especially for tumors <3cm [Rowe
et al., 2003]. NF2 VS do not behave exactly like sporadic VS and require special
consideration [Samii et al., 1997]. Care team experience is important in the formulation of a
treatment plan for NF2 associated VS which commonly includes observation, surgery,
stereotactic radiation or increasingly, drug therapy.

The first important therapeutic consideration for NF2 associated VS is the presence
brainstem compression. Large bilateral VS with obstructive hydrocephalus may cause rapid
loss of consciousness, herniation and death. In such cases urgent surgical removal of at least
one VS is the first life-preserving priority along with diverting cerebrospinal fluid via shunt
to address the hydrocephalus. For tumors greater than or equal to 3 cm in diameter but no
evidence of hydrocephalus or brainstem compression, surgical resection should be
considered as first line therapy, giving consideration to brainstem protection and facial nerve
preservation [Anderson et al, 2005; Myrseth et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 1996]. The various
available approaches for VS surgery (translabyrinthine, middle cranial fossa and
suboccipital) each has advantages and disadvantages; but ultimately surgical outcome is
highly dependent on the team’s experience overall and with the particular approach [Bennet
and Hayes, 2007; Thomsen et al., 1994; Welling et al., 1999]. The primary advantage of the
translabyrinthine approach is direct access to the tumor where it comes into contact with the
facial nerve, allowing development of a clean dissection plane between facial nerve and the
VS [Brackmann et al., 2007; Brackmann and Green, 2008; Day et al., 2004]. Necessary
cerebellar retraction is also minimized with this approach [Day et al., 2004]. The advantage
of the suboccipital approach is a more rapid means to get access to larger VS, but the facial
nerve is hidden from early access as it is on the anterior surface of the tumor [Chen et al.,
2010; Samii and Matthies, 1997]. This approach may be desirable when the tumor extends
out of the internal auditory canal into the cerebellopontine angle. Finally, the middle cranial
fossa approach is utilized primarily for smaller (<1.5cm) tumors limited to the internal
auditory canal where hearing preservation is a major goal of surgery [Slattery et al., 2011].

A major concern of surgical intervention for VS greater than 3cm in diameter is the risk of
losing facial nerve function [Anderson et al, 2005; Brackmann et al, 2007]. An intact facial
nerve is of critical importance to patients’ quality of life; being required for corneal
protection, facial mimetic function, and speech. Facial nerve monitoring during surgery has
greatly improved the ability to spare this nerve. However, with tumors greater than 2.5cm in
diameter there is increased risk of facial nerve injury with 17% of patients having facial
injury after resection compared to tumors less than 2.5cm where 100% of patients had
satisfactory facial nerve function after resection in a large series [Grey et al., 1996].
Although size is an important factor, the consensus is that facial nerve outcome is not as
good overall in NF2 patients versus patients with idiopathic VS even in the most
experienced hands [Evans et al., 2005; Samii et al, 2008].

VS tumors less than 3 cm in diameter may be monitored for growth and hearing loss, or may
be surgically excised [Bennet and Haynes, 2007; Thomsen et al., 1994]. There is no
consensus about when to pursue surgery for smaller tumors in patients with NF2 (e.g.
following hearing loss only; following tumor growth only; or both). A detailed discussion of
the risks and benefits is required to help the patient choose the optimal approach for each
situation.

Observation of VS without surgical intervention is often the approach taken for a period of
time. The natural history of NF2 associated VS was assessed via a consortium of VS expert
centers [Fisher et al., 2009; Slattery et al., 2004]. They evaluated 540 patients with NF2 and
showed a roughly 7 year delay from the time of symptom onset to diagnosis and that
roughly 1/3 of patients had surgery within 2 years of their diagnosis. In this study, the
average age at diagnosis was 27 years and there was an average of 1mm/year rate of tumor
growth with a high rate of variability. Importantly, the growth rates of the right and left VS
were independent, and rate of growth was not correlated with rate of hearing loss. This
variability suggests that a tailored approach must be taken for each patient with
multidisciplinary assessment from otolaryngology/neuro-otology, neurosurgery, genetics
and neurology in planning the timing of surgical interventions.

When surgery is planned for NF2 VS less than 1.5 cm in diameter, a common strategy is
removal of the VS where hearing is most likely to be preserved post-operatively. If useful
hearing (greater than 70% speech discrimination) is preserved, the second tumor may also
be removed via a hearing preservation approach (either the suboccipital or middle cranial
fossa approach) (Fig 2). If hearing is not successfully preserved in the first ear, but the
cochlear division of the eighth nerve is preserved anatomically, the second ear is monitored
for tumor growth or hearing loss, allowing preservation of hearing as long as possible before
a second surgery [Friedman, et al 2003; Samii et al, 1997; Slattery et al., 2011; Slattery et
al., 2007]. When hearing is declining in the only hearing ear, internal auditory canal
decompression is a surgical approach that may preserve hearing in the affected ear for a
period of time [Slattery et al., 2011]. If the remaining hearing becomes non-functional or
absent, hearing restoration approaches such as cochlear nerve implant (CNI) or auditory
brainstem implant (ABI) can be considered. To assess the utility of CNI, the patient is
referred for promontory stimulation [Tran Ba Huy et al., 2009]. Promontory stimulation is a
means of electrically stimulating any remaining cochlear nerve fibers. If the patient senses
an auditory stimulus with the stimulation, CNI is recommended [Lustig et al., 2006; Neff et
al., 2007; Vincenti et al., 2008]. If during the first surgery the cochlear nerve cannot be not
anatomically preserved, ABI can be considered on the side where the first tumor is removed
[Grayeli et al., 2008]. If the cochlear nerve is anatomically preserved, but has lost hearing
and does not detect auditory signals with the promontory electrical stimulation test, then an
ABI should be considered at the time of the second VS removal [Lesinski-Schiedat et al.,
2000; Schwartz et al., 2008].

Tinnitus is a common complaint of NF2 patients with bilateral VS. It can be severe and in
some cases disabling. Hence, it is another important consideration in the discussion of
surgical expectations. In some cases tinnitus can be improved after surgery, but in as many
as 20% of NF2 patients’ tinnitus worsens post-operatively [David Moffat, unpublished data,
personal communication to D.G.E.]. Interestingly, in the natural history of NF2 series, 27%
of patients developed new onset tinnitus post-operatively [Slattery et al., 2005]. For some
patients, new or worsening tinnitus combined with loss of functional hearing is an
unacceptable complication. This issue deserves detailed pre-operative discussion.

In summary, the range of surgical options for NF2 associated VS is vast in terms of
approach, timing and goals. However, NF2 VS tend to involve more complicated surgeries
than idiopathic VS and require expert multidisciplinary management for optimal surgical
outcome.

Radiosurgery for NF2 Vestibular Schwannoma

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), consisting of a single or limited number of highly accurate
and conformal sessions of therapeutic radiation, is increasingly popular among patients with
idiopathic VS. Although there is no consensus about which VS patients are the best
candidates for SRS, it is widely felt that idiopathic VS tumors that are <3cm, especially
when the patient is older, or poor surgical candidates, are optimal SRS candidates
[International RadioSurgery Association, 2006]. Tumors over 3 cm are not usually
recommended for SRS due to concerns about radiation injury to normal neural structures or
post radiation swelling which may further compromise a compressed brainstem.

The role of any form of external beam radiation therapy for NF2 associated VS remains
controversial. Radiotherapy (either SRS or intensity modulated radiation therapy, IMRT)
has been used in a subset of NF2 tumors that progress despite surgical treatment or in
individuals who are at high risk for operative complications. However, many clinicians are
hesitant to recommend radiation for NF2 patients with tumors of any size. Radiation should
be used with caution in a setting of NF2 since - though the prevalence of nervous system

malignancy is very rare in NF2 population studies - secondary malignancies after
radiotherapy treatment have been reported [Baser et al., 2000]. In a North American and
European study, only 9 of 1242 patients with NF2 were found to have a spontaneous
nervous system malignancy, and all cases were malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNST) [Baser et al., 2000]. In contrast, after radiotherapy for benign tumors such as VS
the prevalence of nervous system malignancies in patients with NF2 was 4717 per 105 (95%
CI 681–8753 per 105). This represented a substantial increase in the incidence of nervous
system malignancies that may be related to the loss of the tumor suppressor gene in patients
with NF2 allowing greater susceptibility to the ionizing effects of radiotherapy [Baser et al.,
2000]. To date, more than 20 cases of malignancies (i.e. glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcomas
or malignant meningiomas) have been reported in patients with NF2 after radiation therapy
[Balsubranamiam et al., 2007]. Because of the focality and size of the radiation dose, it is
possible that SRS has different biologic effects than IMRT or other forms of external beam
radiotherapy. However, it is unknown to what extent this alters the risk of secondary
malignancy in patients with NF2.

Compared with the treatment of sporadic VS where SRS plays a central role in management,
SRS may result in only moderate rates of tumor control and poorer long term hearing
preservation in the setting of NF2. The current best long term data is estimated from a center
in Sheffield, England. Rowe et al. reported on 122 VSs in 92 patients with NF2 treated with
radiotherapy and estimated tumor control at 8 years to be 50%. At 3 years they estimated
40% of patients to have preserved hearing, 40% of patients to have progressive hearing loss
and 20% to have progressed to deafness. The long term risk of facial palsy was 5% [Rowe et
al., 2008]. In another study of 62 patients with NF2-related VS treated with SRS, hearing
preservation was reported to be 73% at 1 year, 59% at 2 years, and 48% at 5 years after
SRS. Facial neuropathy occurred in 5% of patients [Mathieu et al., 2007]. Overall, this data
suggests that there is often short term tumor control and hearing preservation after SRS in
patients with NF2. However, the longer term efficacy (>5 years) of SRS for NF2-related VS
is less robust than with sporadic lesions with <50% of patients retaining hearing.

Current Clinical Care Standards for Meningioma

Meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor seen world-wide. It arises from the
meninges covering the brain and spinal cord, and can involve any portion of the central
nervous system. Most commonly, meningiomas are benign and noted incidentally. However,
in some cases meningiomas involve critical brain areas causing focal neurologic deficits or
brain irritation leading to seizures [Louis et al., 2000]. Standard treatment of idiopathic
meningiomas includes observation if asymptomatic and slowly growing; surgery or
radiation therapy is required for rapidly growing or symptomatic tumors [Nakamura et al.,
2003]. Most commonly symptomatic meningiomas are resected and further intervention is
not required. In some cases of atypical or malignant meningioma additional radiation
therapy is required due to the invasive nature of the tumor [Durand et al., 2009]. Overall,
these tumors account for 25% of all sporadic meningiomas [Willis et al., 2005].

Meningiomas occur in 38–58% of individuals with NF2 and are most often multiple (median
= 3/patient) occurring both in cranial and spinal locations [Goutagny and Kalamarides,
2010; Mautner et al., 1996]. Although meningiomas in NF2 may become symptomatic
independently, or combine with VS to create “collision tumors” near the brainstem, a recent
series in France showed that most meningiomas did not require intervention [Goutagny and
Kalamarides, 2010]. Although these tumors may not require surgery in all patients, the
presence of meningiomas may portend a worse prognosis. In one series, the risk of mortality
was 2.5-fold greater in NF2 patients with meningiomas versus those without meningiomas
[Baser et al., 2002]. In children with NF2, meningiomas are more likely to become
symptomatic and are more likely than VS to be responsible for the presenting symptom

[Evans et al., 1999; Ruggieri et al., 2005]. Hence, although VS are the hallmark tumor of
NF2, meningiomas are responsible for a great deal of morbidity in NF2 and therefore require
specific attention.

Most meningiomas occur in surgically accessible locations and hence, surgery is generally
considered first line therapy if an intervention is needed for a symptomatic meningioma
[Asthagiri et al., 2009]. Further considerations on the role of radiosurgery are presented
below. An additional consideration is the occurrence of parafalcine meningiomas that
encroach upon the sagittal sinus. In idiopathic meningiomas, some experts advocate for
tumor resection prior to sinus invasion [Raza et al., 2010; Sindou and Alvernia, 2008]. In
NF2, given the multiple meningiomas that often involved the falx and the diffuse nature of
the tumor, it is not recommended to pursue resection in order to prevent sagittal sinus
invasion [Goutagny and Kalamarides, 2010]. However, it is important to recognize the
chronic venous hypertension that can occur and contribute to chronic headaches, vision
changes or other neurologic deficits in patients with NF2 and parafalcine meningiomas
[Acebes et al, 2009; Szitkar, 2010].

Radiosurgery for NF2 Meningioma

A number of studies have investigated radiosurgery as the primary treatment modality for
idiopathic meningiomas [Bria et al., 2011; Kondziolka et al., 1998], but there is very little
data about the impact of such treatment for NF2 associated meningiomas. In less surgically
favorable locations involving the skull base and cavernous sinuses, SRS may have a role for
treating meningiomas [Lee et al., 2002]. In addition, in the uncommon case where the
meningioma is atypical or frankly malignant, radiation therapy or SRS after surgical
resection is often considered despite concerns about inducing a second malignancy in the
setting of NF2. Small series have reported successful SRS treatment of NF2 meningiomas
[Kondziolka et al., 2009; Wentworth et al., 2009]. However, these retrospective, single
center series included only small numbers of patients. Hence, there is currently no definitive
data for or against the use of SRS as a primary treatment modality for NF2 associated
meningiomas and for most NF2 associated meningiomas the optimal approaches are
observation or surgery.

PLANNING NF2 CLINICAL TRIALS: WHICH PATIENTS TO RECRUIT?

Responding to the need for additional treatment options for patients with NF2 associated
tumors, new potential therapies are entering the clinical setting via clinical trials. As this
option becomes available for a greater number of patients with NF2, investigators will need
to clearly define the potential risks and benefits of each proposed intervention in the context
of other available therapies so that patients and their care providers may make informed
decisions. Initiation of trials will also require close collaboration between the patients’ care
providers and clinical trialists in order to design trials to allow patients the maximal number
of treatment options while preserving the scientific integrity of the study. A key
consideration in this area is determining which patients should be recruited to which clinical
trials.

NF2 Vestibular Schwannoma Trials – Which Patients to Recruit?

Clinical trials provide access to new treatments and are required for treatment advances.
However, they are intensive for both patients and investigators, expensive and inherently
involve patient risk. Choosing a population for investigation of a new therapy requires
consideration of the safety of the intervention, the clinical demands and the question to be
answered. For example, for NF2 associated VS, the meeting consensus is that patients whom
are >3 years old and with progressive, symptomatic disease (with or without prior treatment)

should be considered for enrollment at this time. These recommendations are based on the
fact that some of the most severe forms of NF2 present in childhood. However, compliance
with the demands of a clinical trial and the risks of agents to be studied may be unacceptable
for children <3 years old or in patients who do not have symptomatic disease. Age
considerations are also determined by the pediatric-specific risks of the investigational agent
or intervention to be studied.

Strictly defining the clinical question the study seeks to answer helps delineate the required
characteristics of patients to be considered for enrollment. For example, if MRI
measurements will be the endpoint in a study of VS, patients enrolled on trial should have
target VS that are ≥1cm in diameter and without implants that would influence interpretation
using current MRI techniques. The perceived risks of the intervention to be tested also
influence the population for enrollment, as in general higher risk is more acceptable to
patients with progressive tumors.

There are essentially two main categories to consider when using progressive disease as the
inclusion criteria: radiographic progression and symptom progression. Radiographic
progression of a given tumor is a familiar criterion to clinical researchers and regulatory
agencies as it is commonly used in oncology trials. Radiographic progression must be
specifically defined (i.e. at least 2mm linear growth in 2 years on MRI or a specified percent
change in volume over time). The advantages of using radiographic progression as a criteria
is that the measures are generally reproducible across a wide number of centers and provide
a baseline measure by which either response or stabilization can be determined. However,
this may not always be the optimal choice given that there is no definitive correlation
between tumor size and function in the tumors that afflict patients with NF2. To address this
limitation, symptomatic progression may be used as the enrollment criteria. For example,
progressive hearing loss or facial palsy may be considered as an enrollment criteria. Again,
very clear definitions of progression are required (i.e. change in word recognition score over
12 months).

The Workshop consensus was that for NF2 associated VS, patients deemed particularly
appropriate for current clinical trials are those with progressive hearing loss in their only
hearing ear where the outcomes and risks of the currently available treatment options
(deafness from surgery, risks of radiation therapy) are suboptimal. Patients with brainstem
compression leading to radiographic evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus due to enlarging
VS are also considered high priority candidates for clinical trials with agents that have the
potential to halt tumor progression or shrink tumor given the risks associated with surgery
for such tumors (when surgical decompression is not needed urgently to reverse
hydrocephalus or brainstem compression).

Patients who would not currently be recommended for inclusion in VS drug trials are
patients with non-progressive disease and patients with small (less than or equal to 1.5 cm
diameter), asymptomatic tumors where functional preservation of hearing is likely without
intervention or with specialized surgical tumor removal (Figure 2). Radiation therapy should
also be considered as a therapeutic option prior to clinical trial enrollment in tumors <3cm,
or in symptomatic tumors on other cranial nerves. Indeed, one avenue for future clinical
studies is to incorporate radiosensitizing agents with radiation to improve the long term
tumor control rates in NF2. However, currently it is rare that radiation therapy is an
attractive option for tumors >3cm, in children, or in non-progressive tumors. In these cases,
observation, surgery or a clinical trial specific to the clinical situation is preferred.

Finally, the inclusion of patients with unilateral sporadic VS in clinical drug trials designed
primarily for patients with NF2 has several potentially important benefits. NF2-associated

VS and unilateral sporadic VS have many similarities both histopathologically and in their
underlying genetics. For example, the protein Merlin is absent in all VS studied to date
whether related to NF2 or not [Hadfield et al., 2010]. Importantly, idiopathic VS have a
lifetime risk of close to 1/1000 [Evans et al., 2005] and hence are a common brain tumor in
the general population. Identification of effective systemic therapies for these tumors
through NF2-focused research may ultimately benefit a much larger population of patients.

Cranial Meningioma Trials – Which Patients to Recruit?

As discussed above, the standard for NF2 associated meningiomas is observation unless
these tumors become symptomatic. In symptomatic tumors, the standard therapy is surgery,
which is frequently feasible and effective. Currently, the consensus opinion is that patients
recommended to be considered for NF2 associated meningioma clinical trials should have
recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade I or II tumors. Patients with WHO grade
III (malignant meningioma) meningiomas have a different natural history and should have
dedicated clinical trials. Given that about 70% of sporadic meningiomas carry the NF2
mutation [Goutagny and Kalamarides, 2010], therapeutic trials assessing both NF2
associated and sporadic meningiomas harboring the NF2 mutation may be indicated. These
inclusion criteria would require surgical intervention for tissue sampling first, however, in
most cases initial surgical management prior to an experimental agent is desirable.
Meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and there are no known
effective systemic therapies for this tumor, hence, development of clinical trials for residual
or progressive meningiomas after surgery and radiation therapy is a need for both patients
with NF2 and for the tens of thousands of patients with idiopathic meningiomas.

The unclear history and diversity of NF2-associated spinal cord tumors, along with their
relative infrequency compared to VS and cranial meningiomas, makes for a difficult tumor
population to develop clinical trials for at this time. Whole body imaging (such as MRI)
should be incorporated into NF2 clinical trials whenever possible as a secondary endpoint to
add to the cumulative knowledge of the natural history of NF2 spinal cord tumors, and to
allow monitoring of any serendipitous response to therapies principally targeted to VS or
meningioma. When it is determined that therapeutic intervention is required, it is reasonable
to refer NF2 patients to available general population clinical trials designed for the particular
spinal cord tumor types.

The Pediatric NF2 Population - Role in NF2 Clinical Trials

Although NF2 is traditionally thought to present in young adults, registry data has shown
that 18% of newly diagnosed NF2 patients are younger than 15 years of age [Evans et al.,
1999]. NF2 manifestations in children generally involve skin and ophthalmologic findings
as well as meningiomas causing focal neurologic deficits; and there is an association
between early development of symptoms and poor prognosis [Baser et al., 2002]. Hence,
recognition and treatment of NF2 associated symptoms in children may allow administration
of therapies that could delay the development of neurologic morbidity and potentially
mortality.

There are rare cases with fulminant disease progression very early in life for which the
currently available treatments of surgery and radiation therapy are insufficient [Evans et al.,
2009; Mautner et al., 1993; Nunes and MacCollin, 2003; Ruggieri et al., 2005]. In one series
of 12 patients diagnosed with NF2 before 18 years old, there was a high tumor burden with
>75% of patients having VS, other cranial nerve schwannomas, meningiomas or spinal cord
tumors [Nunes and MacCollin, 2003]. At least 75% of the children had hearing loss and in
the 58% of patients who underwent surgery for VS, none had preserved hearing post-

operatively. Hence, the limited literature regarding NF2 in children suggests that there is a
subpopulation that presents with early and severe disease and for whom the currently
available treatment options are quickly exhausted.

As diagnostic criteria are applied more uniformly and more families with NF2 are
registered, the frequency of identification of children with both asymptomatic and
symptomatic tumors is increasing. For example, a United Kingdom series found that 9% of
patients (33/343) were diagnosed before age 10 years [Evans et al., 1999]. When
considering enrolling children in NF2 clinical trials it is important to recognize that although
hearing loss may be one manifestation, presenting symptoms more commonly include
unilateral congenital amblyopia that may lead to blindness and focal neurologic deficits due
to neuropathy or meningioma. Finally, an important consideration is that children may have
unique toxicities to consider including the potential impact on growth and normal
development that are not as concerning in adults. The duration of therapy and the long term
impact of experimental therapies have to be considered. Overall, these considerations
require a solid understanding of the disposition of the investigational agent in children and a
relatively high risk population to offset the unknown potential long-term risks of the
experimental agent.

Incorporating patients who have received radiotherapy in NF2 clinical trials

Tumors that have undergone radiation therapy may have a different natural history than non-
radiated tumors as radiotherapy may either improve outcome via effective tumor control or
worsen the disease course due to malignant transformation. In the short term following
radiation, there can be acute or sub-acute inflammatory changes that can alter MRI
interpretation. Careful consideration must be given to these factors as clinical trials for NF2
patients are likely to be small in number and therefore not allow stratification for such
variables. However, patients previously treated with radiation therapy should be considered
for NF2 trials with these factors in mind. In addition, trials to assess the short- and long-term
impact of radiation therapy are needed to better define the risks and benefits of radiation for
patients with NF2.

DESIGN OF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR PATIENTS WITH NF2

The common progression of clinical trials is from dose finding, tolerability studies (Phase I)
to efficacy studies designed to explore clinical activity (Phase II) and then to confirmatory
efficacy studies to demonstrate that the new therapy is better than either existing therapies or
placebo (Phase III). The success or failure of phase II studies is predicated on many factors
over and above whether or not the treatment drug has the desired effect, including the
endpoints chosen to demonstrate efficacy, the appropriate dose and dosing schedule taken
from phase I studies, and the power of the study to detect a statistically significant
difference. In order to increase the efficiency of efficacy studies, there has been increasing
interest in incorporating translational studies or ‘Phase zero’ studies early in new drug
investigations.

Phase Zero or Translational Studies in NF2

Phase zero is a term popularly applied to translational clinical studies in which a study drug
is administered to a small number of patients (often less than 10) over a short period of time
to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Such studies are designed to
accelerate the development of promising drugs by assessing whether the agent of interest
behaves in human subjects and tissues as expected from preclinical studies.

Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published Phase zero
guidelines as part of the 2006 Guidance on Exploratory Investigational New Drug (IND)

Studies. The FDA-specific definition of Phase zero trials under the exploratory IND includes
first-in-human testing of new agents at sub-therapeutic doses and provides for the
assessment of drug-target effects and PK-PD relationships in humans. In the setting of NF2,
Phase zero studies may consist of novel, biomarker-driven early clinical trial concepts that
assess drug-target effects in human NF2-specific tumors in vivo, using drugs already
approved for other tumors or disease indications. A Phase zero study would prescribe the
drug of interest at the FDA approved dosing for other indications and assess if the agent
reaches NF2-related tumors in active concentrations and shows the expected biological
effects such as molecular target and signaling pathway inhibition. This assessment can be
done via tissue sampling at the time of a planned surgical procedure, with imaging
biomarkers or via other approaches such as microdialysis to assess the intratumoral
extracellular drug concentrations [Blakeley et al., 2009]. If the predefined PK or PD
endpoints are met, this is an early sign of biologic activity at the site of disease and provides
rationale for advancing to clinical efficacy testing. Since no direct benefit is expected for
study participants given the short duration of drug exposure, Phase zero trials are limited to
drugs that have a well-known safety profiles, minimal expected side-effects, do not interfere
with surgery and wound healing, and do not pose any known long-term risks. Based on
encouraging preclinical data [Ammoun et al., 2010; Doherty et al., 2008] a Phase zero trial
using lapatinib, a dual EGFR/ErB2 small-molecule inhibitor for patients with NF2-related
and sporadic VSs is currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00863122).
Additional Phase zero trials with other molecular targeted agents including sorafenib for
NF2 are expected to open within the next year. Patients with NF2 who have chosen a
surgical therapy as their best treatment are optimal candidates for translational studies. In
combined translational/efficacy trial designs, the experimental agent can be restarted post-
operatively and assessed for its ability to impact the residual tumors.

Phase I Studies in NF2

Agents that are new to human studies or that have specific side effects or mechanisms that
may affect NF2 patients in unpredictable ways may require a study to specifically address
safety and tolerability in patients with NF2. The need for safety assessments prior to efficacy
testing is dependent on the treatment to be assessed and the amount of information about the
safety of that agent. When it is determined that tolerability and toxicity studies are needed,
these can be done simultaneously with phase zero investigations to maximize the
information available about the drug prior to efficacy testing.

Phase 2 Efficacy Studies in NF2

Careful selection of agents for efficacy testing and thoughtful trial design is particularly
important in NF2 given the relative rarity of the disease and therefore, limited patient
numbers for enrollment. Defining endpoints with precision requires detailed understanding
of the natural history of the tumor of interest and the mechanism of the agent under
investigation. The trial can then be structured with strict “go/no go” evaluation points based
on the pre-determined primary endpoint. For example, VS with progressive growth over
months have a less than 1% chance of spontaneous regression [Harris et al., 2008; Slattery et
al., 2004]. Rather, 99% will continue to grow in volume. Therefore, a drug that is designed
to reduce volume will have to show reduction in only 4 of 10 patients to demonstrate
efficacy for that endpoint. Hence, small, single group trials may be sufficient to demonstrate
efficacy in the right scenario. For more exploratory phase II studies, small multi-arm trials
using novel designs such as adaptive randomization, “pick-the-winner” design, sequential
accrual, and randomized discontinuation may be considered. For example, in an adaptive
randomization study, patients initially would be randomized equally to one of three agents.
As the efficacy of the arms become evident, more patients will be randomized to the arms
with promising results, and the less promising arms will be dropped. These novel designs

potentially allow more agents to be screened rapidly, and reduce the overall number of
patients that will be required. However, these studies also require strictly defined endpoints
and the close collaboration of committed centers with strong, real-time statistical support.
The slow growth of VS also allows patients to potentially cross over between study arms
after a washout period if the predetermined endpoint is not achieved.

Given the scarcity of resources for NF2 clinical trials, it is important to forge collaborations
with others doing clinical trials in similar tumor types. For example, ongoing meningioma
efficacy studies may include NF2 associated meningioma patients. Although differences
between sporadic and NF2 associated meningiomas must be accounted for to allow accurate
interpretation of the results, collaboration with other tumor trials is feasible and may allow
greater opportunity for trial development in NF2. Finally, as drugs develop along the clinical
pipeline, consideration will have to be given to how to perform confirmatory studies for
clinical efficacy. Patients with NF2 requiring treatment for progressive tumors are unlikely
to accept a placebo, however, as mentioned above, there is no clear consensus as to the
optimal treatment strategies for many NF2 associated tumors. Overall, it is not clear that a
traditional phase III (large, double-blind, placebo-controlled) trial will be appropriate for
NF2 patients.

NF2 Prevention Trials

Current clinical trials are focused on patients with progressive or symptomatic tumors.
However, as the clinical and pre-clinical repertoire grows and as new natural history data
becomes available, it will be desirable to identify therapies that can halt tumor progression
before patients are symptomatic. The drugs in development currently are predominantly
agents that halt cell growth or communication and hence may not be safe for long term use,
particularly in young patients. Moreover, common endpoints in prevention studies (i.e. time
to symptom onset) require better understanding of the natural history of each tumor type and
ideally, the development of biomarkers to accurately report tumor change. The consensus
opinion is that state of science is not yet mature enough to support prevention studies, but
may be in the near future.

Quality of Life/Disease Severity Considerations in NF2 Clinical Trials

The major threats to quality of life (QOL) in patients with NF2 include: loss of hearing,
mobility, and balance; facial disfigurement; pain; and social and emotional problems
[Hornigold et al., 2010; Neary et al., 2010]. Studies assessing quality of life in patients with
late onset hearing loss without NF2 suggest that there is an association between degree of
hearing impairment, social isolation, perceived disability and depression [Nachtegaal et al.,
2009]. Moreover, there is some indication that although patients with late-onset hearing loss
have decreased reported QOL at baseline, there is the possibility for improvement with
effective therapies. Studies in patients receiving CNI for adult onset hearing loss suggest
that specific improvement in function such as communication abilities directly influenced
perceived QOL [Zhao et al., 2008].

In order to better assess the specific factors effecting QOL in patients with NF2, Neary et al.
[2010] produced a 32 item closed set postal questionnaire to identify the extent and severity
of QOL issues in 62 NF2 patients and compared responses to the Short Form-36
questionnaire (SF36). Subsequently, Hornigold and colleagues [2010] developed an
independent 8 item scoring system validated against the EuroQOL and SF-36 questionnaires
expressly for patients with NF2 named The Guy's NF2 Impact Severity Score (NFTI-SS).
Both of these measures remain in validation stages currently. As reliable tools to assess
QOL are developed, QOL may serve as an important endpoint for future studies in NF2.

SELECTING APPROPRIATE NF2 CLINICAL TRIAL ENDPOINTS
Hearing Endpoints for NF2 Clinical Trials

There are two forms of hearing loss in patients with NF2. The first, and most common, is
gradual hearing loss. Importantly, the correlation between tumor size and hearing is not
strong, hearing loss can occur with tumors of any size and the exact mechanism of hearing
loss is unknown. Hearing aids cannot reliably address VS-related hearing loss because
amplifying sound levels does not address the issue of poor quality word information that is
characteristic of hearing loss related to VS. Eventually, most patients with NF2 suffer
complete hearing loss either from tumor growth or from the morbidity of surgical or
radiation treatment. Although CNI and ABI devices provide benefit for some patients, there
is no widely effective treatment for the gradual hearing loss experienced by NF2 patients.

The second form of hearing loss is sudden hearing loss (defined as hearing loss with onset
over a period of less than 72 hours) [Rauch, 2008]. The generally accepted treatment for
sudden hearing loss is a tapered course of oral corticosteroids (usually prednisone or
methylprednisolone). Although sudden hearing loss is concerning for patients and clinicians,
gradual hearing loss is the main cause of deafness in NF2 patients. Most NF2 patients lose
hearing after acquisition of language; thus, the effect of hearing loss on their QOL is
typically severe.

Common tests of hearing include detection of sound (measured as pure tone thresholds at
individual stimulus frequencies or the average of several frequencies [pure tone average,
PTA]) and speech discrimination (measured as word recognition score based on
standardized word lists and presentation conditions). Other hearing tests such as oto-acoustic
emissions (OAEs) or auditory brainstem response (ABR) monitor auditory function that is
not clinically significant for patients. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and
Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) scale, a composite hearing endpoint, is in wide clinical use for
reporting hearing preservation results after VS surgery [American Academy of
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, 1995]. This scale uses PTA and word
recognition scores to classify hearing into four grades (A–D). Because the AAO-HNS scale
uses one category to score all hearing ears with word recognition less than 50% (Class D), it
is insensitive to changes in hearing within the category that may have clinical relevance for
NF2 patients with a single hearing ear.

Speech discrimination (word recognition score) is a good primary hearing endpoint in VS
trials because it directly measures a patient’s ability to communicate through speech. An
improvement in word recognition would be of special value in NF2 patients, who often have
only one hearing ear and whose hearing cannot be significantly improved with
amplification. In clinical trials, a hearing response would be defined as the smallest
improvement in word recognition score over baseline that meets criteria for statistical
significance at the P = 0.05 level [Halpin and Rauch, 2006]. Values are defined for detecting
a statistically significant change in word recognition at the P = 0.05 level for different
baseline scores using 50- and 100-word lists [Thornton and Raffin, 1978]. The table of
values can be used to compare any two scores from the same patient, such as before and
after treatment. Currently, 50-word lists are used in word recognition score testing.
However, the confidence interval be reduced (and accuracy increased) by using 100 word
lists. A simple ‘hearing response criteria table’ could be widely implemented to standardize
clinical trials of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery for VS.

Lesion Volume Endpoints for NF2 Clinical Trials

Imaging of tumors is now a well-accepted endpoint for many cancer trials. Imaging is
advantageous as it is non-invasive and given careful acquisition and analysis, shrinkage of

tumor provides unequivocal evidence of biologic activity. However, imaging can encompass
a wide variety of techniques and challenges that have to be carefully considered based on the
tumor of interest and the experimental agent. There are two principle issues to consider for
managing imaging metrics in NF2 clinical trials: what image acquisition and measurement
criteria to use; and how to coordinate the workflow and reporting of metrics for a clinical
trial. Options for measurement criteria to track change in lesion size include linear measures,
such as RECIST criteria [Therasse et al., 2000] or three-dimensional measures of lesion
volume [Harris et al., 2008].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common diagnostic imaging modality used
in patients with NF2 for tracking growth of lesions, including VS or other lesions such as
meningioma or spinal schwannoma. In general, linear measures of VS underestimated
volumetric growth by an average of 50% on MRI [Harris et al., 2008]. Although not
routinely clinically available due to resource constraints, increasingly software is available
for making semi-automated lesion volumetric measurements [Sorensen et al., 2001], which
can be applied to NF2 lesions [Harris et al., 2008].

Standardization of image acquisition protocol used across sites, patients, and time points for
a clinical trial are as important as image analysis. This is true of all body regions to be
imaged. Table I summarizes the guidelines of a standardized imaging protocol for VS.
Reliable acquisition and measurements are one step in a complex workflow involving
organization of measurement requests, image transfers from multiple sites to a central
analysis facility, image archiving, reproducible measurement techniques, quality assurance
by trained staff, adherence to the clinical trial prescribed metrics, and longitudinal results
reporting. To streamline the clinical trials process and to create a reliable and uniform
workflow, infrastructure for collecting scans to support clinical trials has been developed.
For example, the Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC; www.tumormetrics.org), is an
integrated system that currently manages imaging metrics for over 300 imaging clinical
trials [Urban et al., 2010]. A parallel site was developed specifically for NF tumor metrics
and NF clinical trials (www.nftumormetrics.org).

Molecular endpoints and Paradigms for NF2 Clinical Trials

Traditionally, clinical trials in oncology have employed clinical response criteria, such as
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) to assess treatment efficacy,
ideally compared to a placebo arm. Using such endpoints, however, is typically not feasible
for a rare disease with multiple, slow-growing tumors and a variable clinical course, such as
NF2. In theory, substituting molecular for clinical endpoints may help identify active drugs
for NF2 patients in vivo in a much shorter period of time with fewer patients and at a lower
cost, and potentially help eliminate drugs that do not reach the target and/or show
insufficient evidence of biological activity in the tumor tissue of interest [Tan et al., 2009].
In addition, this approach provides a unique opportunity to gain valuable insights into the
effects of drug on molecular signaling in vivo and help confirm or reject observations
gleaned from preclinical model systems. For example, positive or negative signaling
feedback loops identified in response to treatment in preclinical models may or may not be
operational in humans in vivo. In addition, unexpected escape or resistance mechanisms
may be uncovered by studying drug-treated human tumor tissue and such data may help
drive the future development of molecular targeted therapies. Defining the specific
molecular endpoints for a given drug can be challenging, in particular if the drug has several
targets or significant off-target effects. Phase zero studies are one approach to investigate
these questions and are optimal for drugs with well-described mechanisms of action and PD
endpoints [Tan et al., 2009].

The optimal investigation of molecular drug effects is to investigate tumor tissue before and
after treatment. Repeat sampling of brain and spinal tumors is not feasible requiring the
comparison of treated patient samples to non-treated samples from a control group. This
limits analysis to biomarkers with a low inter-patient variability and a robust response to
treatment. An ongoing study of sorafenib in NF2 patients is assessing drug effect in
cutaneous schwannomas since these can be accessed pre- and post-treatment. An inherent
limitation of surrogate tissue is that it may or may not truly reflect the primary tissue of
interest (i.e. VS), however, it does allow pre- and post-treatment assessments of a in vivo
biologic effect.

In summary, carefully designed exploratory clinical trials with molecular endpoints rather
than traditional endpoints may help prioritize drugs emerging from the NF2 preclinical
pipeline [Evans et al., 2009] for further study in efficacy trials with traditional or NF2-
specific clinical endpoints [Plotkin et al., 2009].

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF NF2 TUMOR SUPPRESSION AND
CANDIDATE DRUG TARGETS

Located on chromosome 22q 11.2, the NF2 gene is biallelically inactivated in NF2 tumors.
The NF2 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein called Merlin/ Schwannomin (commonly
known as Merlin) [Rouleau et al., 1993; Trofatter et al., 1993]. In normal cells, Merlin, a
regulator of cell growth and cell-cell interactions, is expressed diffusely across several cell
types including Schwann cells, meningeal cells, mesothelial cells and lens cells [McClatchey
& Giovannini, 2005].

The roles of Merlin protein are wide-reaching. It impacts several tumorigenic pathways and
acts within several intracellular sites. Questions that are now emerging in an effort to fully
understand Merlin’s function include: how many complexes can Merlin form in a given
cell? Of Merlin’s various cellular roles, which are pathogenic when abrogated, and therefore
important for drug targeting? Conversely, is Merlin a universal regulator, such that
inhibiting a single cellular pathway will have a low likelihood of success in controlling
growth of NF2-associated tumors? Ongoing research is addressing these questions to further
elucidate the molecular interactions at large in the setting of a NF2 gene mutation.

Recent evidence suggests that Merlin may also be a negative regulator of growth and
progression of several non-NF2 associated cancer types [Stamenkovic and Yu, 2010].
Indeed, many of the pathways that appear important in NF2 tumorigenesis contribute to the
growth of a diverse number of cancers such as breast, colon, liver and renal cell carcinoma
as well as many hematologic malignancies. This supports the idea that therapies developed
for NF2-associated tumors could well have much broader clinical applications.

As we learn about the pro-tumorigenic pathways in which loss of Merlin function is
implicated, cellular targets are identified that may respond to therapeutics (“druggable
targets”). As noted above, some of these drug targets are common to other cancer
conditions, and as a result there are several drugs currently in development and clinical use
that may inhibit NF2 target pathways. Figure 3 highlights the up- and downstream candidate
drug targets currently of most significant interest in NF2.

In the last few years, there has been a concerted effort to accelerate the identification of NF2
therapies by bridging basic discoveries and translational science. The NF Preclinical
Consortium (NFPC) sponsored by the Children’s Tumor Foundation offers a unique
approach to facilitating preclinical trials. Candidate NF drugs are assessed in parallel in a
series of validated NF1 and NF2 genetically modified mouse models and xenograft mouse

tumor models. NFPC has employed standardization of PK/PD analysis across models and
sites; and collaborative interpretation of data. Established in 2008, NFPC has been
successful in collaborating with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and offered
valuable lessons about how to overcome the challenges in NF2 preclinical drug testing.
Though promising results in a mouse do not necessarily predict human efficacy, NFPC
should inform future selection of drug candidates to be advanced to the clinic, and shed light
on relevant drug pathways.

As a general note, it is likely that multiple target inhibition - using combination therapies or
by using single agents designed to impact multiple targets - may be a more potent
therapeutic approach than single target inhibition. However, in designing combined therapy
trials, attention to PK interactions, combined toxicities and cost is required particularly
given that NF2 tumors are largely not malignant. Preclinical investigations are critical for
defining the PK relationships and toxicities before committing to clinical investigation.
Some of the key drug targets currently under investigation for NF2 are described below.

Epidermal Growth Factor Family

In NF2, the loss of Merlin protein leads to abnormal activation of the Epidermal Growth
Factor family (EGFR) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) namely EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3
which span the cell membrane. In the normal cell these EGFR family RTKs activate cell
division, contribute to feed-back loops, and regulate cell death. In the absence of Merlin,
RTKs remain constitutively active allowing increased cell proliferation and resistance to cell
death [McClatchey & Fehon, 2010].

Drugs that target the EGFR family of RTK include lapatinib (a dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor),
erlotinib, and gefitinib. All are oral agents already approved by the FDA for various cancers.
These drugs have been investigated as NF2 therapies, principally for VS and ependymoma.
In vitro, merlin deficient cells showed aberrant EGFR activation and inhibition of EGFR
signaling decreased cellular proliferation [Curto et al., 2007]. However, in a clinical study,
erlotinib (which inhibits EGFR alone) failed to show tumor response in NF2 patients with
progressive VS [Plotkin et al., 2010]. Long-acting inhibitors that target multiple EGFR/ErbB
family members have recently been developed. These are being tested in clinical trials for
various other cancers and are of great interest as potential NF2 therapies.

The RAS-GTP Pathway

RAS was one of the first oncogenes identified, and is one of the most common, having a role
in multiple tumor types. Normal RAS is bound to the internal cell membrane and can
assume two formations: active, promoting cell growth and proliferation (RAS-GTP state) or
inactive (RAS-GDP state) [Blum and Kloog, 2005]. In normal cells, Merlin forms
complexes with Ezrin at the membrane, and silences RAS-GAP [Morrison et al., 2007].
However, in Merlin’s absence, RAS can remain active, drive cell proliferation and
contribute to tumor growth.

It is difficult to design a drug specifically to target activated RAS. However, there are
several agents such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors that indirectly inhibit RAS activation
[Blum & Kloog, 2005]. RAS can also be targeted by inhibiting downstream cell signaling
pathway pro-survival and pro-proliferation elements including Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and
PI3-K-Akt (Fig 3). A number of agents targeting these have been assessed in NF2. For
example, AR-12 is a derivative of the anti-inflammatory celecoxib that inhibits PI3K/Akt
via phosphoinositide-dependent Kinase 1 (PDK-1) inhibition, inhibiting growth of VS and
malignant schwannoma cells [Lee, 2009]. Honokiol, a natural compound found in the bark
and leaves of Magnolia trees that has pro-apoptotic effects in several cancers, has recently

Page 16

been shown to inhibit the growth of VS cells [Lee, 2010], also appears to act via Akt
inhibition.

Rac is another Ras downstream element and a member of the Rho-like GTPases that
contributes to cell migration and invasion in malignancy. In the absence of functional
Merlin, Rac becomes activated and allows integrin-RTK signaling resulting in tumor
proliferation [Okada et al., 2007]. Rac may represent another target of interest for NF2.

Raf/MEK/ERK is in a parallel signaling pathway downstream of Ras with roles in cell
proliferation and cell cycle arrest depending on the signal [Peyssonnaux & Eychene, 2001].
This pathway may also be dysregulated in the absence of Merlin. Sorafenib is a multiple
RTK inhibitor that targets Raf/Mek/Erk pathway in addition to PDGF, VEGF and c-kit,
while nilotinib is a new generation RTK inhibitor of BCR-ABL that also targets PDGFR and
c-kit. Both sorafenib and nilotinib are entering clinical trials for VS and are discussed in
more detail below.

Another downstream element in Merlin’s tumor suppressor activity is mammalian target of
Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) [James et al., 2009]. mTORC1 is constitutively activated
in both schwannomas and meningiomas with Merlin deficiency [James et al, 2009; Lopez-
Lago et al., 2009]. Several mTOR inhibitors are in clinical use for other conditions including
NF1 associated plexiform neurofibromas, and may also be of potential interest for NF2.
These include rapamycin, everolimus and temsirolimus.

mTOR

VEGF and PDGF

Angiogenesis is a requirement for malignant tumor growth, and more recently has been
implicated in the benign tumors found in NF2. VS activate the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) pathway in both tumor cells and associated endothelial cells, suggesting a
role for angiogenesis in the growth of these benign tumors [Plotkin et al., 2009; Wong et al.,
2010]. The VEGF-targeted agent bevacizumab has shown promise in some NF2 patients and
is now in a clinical trial for progressive VS.

Heat Shock Proteins

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the chaperone proteins that are responsible for
ensuring the target proteins are correctly folded and transported throughout the cell. It is one
of the proteins in the microenvironment that indirectly contributes to cancer cell
proliferation. Hsp90 is increasingly investigated as a target for inhibition in malignancies.
For example, the agent, NXD30001, induces regression of glioblastoma (GBM) in a mouse
model [Zhu et al., 2010].

DCAF1: Ubiquitin Ligase Inhibitor

It was recently reported that Merlin in its closed formation can accumulate in the nucleus
and interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 (DCAF1) [Li, 2010]. Depleting DCAF1 with
an inhibitor reduced proliferation of Schwann cells cultured from NF2 patients [Li et al.,
2010]. DCAF1 has not previously been investigated widely in cancer research, but is known
to be one of the target proteins of a HIV-1 accessory gene that induces cell-cycle arrest
[Nonaka et al., 2009]. Modifiers of DCAF1 or related proteins may provide a new NF2
therapeutic avenue for exploration.

Traditional Cytotoxic Therapies and NF2

Though recent focus has principally been on targeted biologic drugs, there may still be a role
in NF2 for traditional chemotherapies. The major concern about using such agents is the
potential for unacceptably high toxicities, especially given the likely need in NF2 for
prolonged use. Importantly, since VS are largely benign tumors, the tumor cells may be
proliferating at such low rates as to render cytotoxic therapies ineffective. Nonetheless, in
select cases screening of traditional cytotoxic agents, for example following VS malignant
progression or in meningioma, may be warranted and should be considered.

ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR NF2
Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all biologically
active isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, or VEGF-A) with high
affinity (kd = 1.1 nM). VEGF is one of the most potent and specific angiogenic factors and
is a critical regulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis. To date, over 7000 adult
patients have been treated in clinical trials with bevacizumab as monotherapy or in
combination regimens for a variety of cancers. Bevacizumab has been studied in the
pediatric population in 3 clinical trials and two retrospective reports. Across all of these
studies, with evaluation periods ranging from 1 month to 2 years, there have not been any
dose limiting or major toxicities seen in children treated with bevacizumab [Benesch et al.,
2008; Glade Bender et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Modak and Cheung, 2010; Packer et al.,
2009].

Although initially developed for cancers, VEGF is overexpressed compared to normal tissue
in sporadic VS by expression analysis [Evans, 2009], though not when measured by
immunohistochemistry [Plotkin et al., 2009]. It was recently shown that bevacizumab
treatment results in clinical improvement in individuals with NF2 and progressive symptoms
related to VS [Mautner et al., 2010a; Plotkin et al., 2009]. In 10 NF2 patients at risk for
complete hearing loss, bevacizumab at 5mg/kg IV every 2 weeks resulted in 4 of 7 evaluable
patients having significantly improved word recognition scores and 6 of 10 patients
experiencing ≥ 20% reduction in tumor volume [Plotkin et al., 2009]. An ongoing
prospective study is confirming and expanding these findings in which individuals with NF2
and symptomatic VS (progressive hearing loss over the preceding 24 months) who are not
candidates for surgery or radiotherapy are treated with bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV every 3
weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01207687). The primary endpoint is change in
word recognition score based on a 100 word list. Secondary endpoints are tumor volume,
exploratory advanced MRI studies, whole body MRI, plasma biomarkers and QOL
measures. The study is designed to confirm a reliable improvement in hearing with
bevacizumab and to explore in detail its mechanism of action and duration of effect in the
setting of NF2 associated VS.

Despite promising initial results, many important questions about the role of bevacizumab in
NF2 remain. Most importantly, bevacizumab can impair wound healing, and surgery must
be scheduled only after the drug has cleared from the system. This can be limiting for NF2
patients whom have multiple tumor types that may need to be addressed concurrently. Also,
recent case reports suggest that the bevacizumab effect is temporary and when drug is
stopped, radiographic or clinical benefit was reversed [Mautner et al., 2010b].

One possibility is that there is a unique interaction between anti-angiogenic mechanisms and
Merlin deficiency that will benefit from combining bevacizumab with another drug therapy.
For example, elevated levels of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) have been observed
in NF2 VS and meningiomas [Ammoun et al., 2010]. PDGF has been suggested to be

activated in the setting of VEGF inhibition in some malignancies, allowing angiogenic
escape [Pietras et al., 2008]. However, in a Phase II study of recurrent meningiomas treated
with the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib mesylate, there was no significant clinical benefit [Wen
et al., 2009]. Ultimately, there may be rationale for combining VEGF inhibition with other
targeted therapies such as imatinib, nilotinib or sorafenib.

Lapatinib

Lapatinib is a small molecule RTK inhibitor that is orally active and reversibly inhibits both
EGFR and ErbB2, blocking phosphorylation and activation of Erk1/2 (phospho-Erk1/2) and
Akt (phospho-Akt) in EGFR and/or ErbB2-expressing tumor cell lines and animal
xenografts [Rusnack et al., 2001]. It is commercially available and FDA approved for
metastatic breast cancer in combination with cytotoxic therapies. Lapatinib is well tolerated
with manageable side effects in adults and pediatric patients [Fouladi et al., 2010]. For these
reasons it is of great interest for NF2. However, a pre-requisite for efficacy of any anti-
tumor therapy is that the drug can cross the blood-brain barrier, access the tumor and affect
the drug target. To examine this, in an ongoing phase zero trial discussed above, individuals
with either idiopathic or NF2 associated vestibular schwannomas take lapatinib for 10 days
prior to tumor resection. At the time of resection blood and tissue samples are collected to
assess the plasma to tumor PK ratio and to assess molecular markers of activity in the tumor.
The information gained from this study will inform about the mechanism of action of
lapatinib at the level of the tumor as assist in the interpretation and planning of future studies
with similar agents.

Concurrently, a phase II clinical trial of lapatinib in children and adults with progressive VS
is ongoing. In a 2-stage design, NF2 patients older than 3 years of age with progressive VS
are eligible (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00973739). Lapatinib is administered
continuously for 28-day courses. The primary endpoint is defined as a decrease of at least
15% in tumor volume. Enrollment of the first trial stage has been completed with nine
eligible patients. Two of the nine patients discontinued protocol therapy after 3 treatment
cycles due to radiological progression. One patient had a 16.6% reduction in the VS tumor
volume after 3 cycles, and two patients remain on treatment for >12 months for stable
disease. The trial is currently enrolling patients.

Sorafenib and Nilotinib

Sorafenib is a multiple RTK inhibitor that targets Raf/Mek/Erk pathway in addition to
PDGF, VEGF and c-kit. Sorafenib is currently being investigated in a small pediatric
clinical trial for NF1 plexiform neurofibromas, and planning is underway in the United
Kingdom to bring this drug into a phase zero NF2 clinical trials based on positive NF2 in
vitro data [Ammoun et al., 2008]. This trial will be informed by the ongoing NF1 trial
where, especially in younger children, tumor pain and rash made dose reductions necessary
and side effects correlate with high plasma concentrations of sorafenib. The NF2 trial
planned will examine tolerability as well as molecular efficacy via cutaneous schwannoma
biopsies pre- and post-treatment in each patient.

Nilotinib, an analog of imatinib, is a new generation RTK inhibitor of BCR-ABL that also
targets PDGFR and c-kit. It has also shown promising NF2 in vitro data although less
effective than sorafenib [Ammoun et al., 2011]. However, nilotinib is likely to have fewer
clinical side effects than sorafenib. A Phase Zero trial with a similar design as described for
sorafenib is currently underway. This includes15 patients receiving 14 days of oral dosing
and is a simple trial design (only requiring 3 clinic visits over 28 days). A Phase II study of
nilotinib for VS is planned for 2011 in Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01201538).

PTC299

Page 19

PTC299 is an oral VEGF inhibitor that acts by binding to the 5’ untranslated region (UTR)
of the VEGF mRNA. In vitro, PTC299 potently inhibits VEGF production in a broad range
of tumor types, including breast, colorectal, fibrosarcoma, gastric, and lung cell cancer lines.
In vivo, the drug reduced levels of VEGF in plasma and tumors and inhibited the growth of
multiple tumor xenografts. A Phase II study of PTC299 in NF2 patients with progressive VS
is currently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00911248).

ADVANCES IN PATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SCHWANNOMAS

The detailed pathological review of schwannomas is an important, but often overlooked,
resource. The pathological evaluation of resected drug-treated tumors compared to treated
tumors, can yield valuable information in both preclinical and clinical settings. Human
samples that are collected tend toward tumors that have failed to respond to treatment, since
surgery will not be done on responsive tumors; but a close examination of treated tumors
can yield valuable information about drug effects - status of signaling pathway activation,
effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and vascular density.

Pathologic review of schwannomas can also shed light on new therapeutic targets.
Investigation of schwannomas in their earliest phase of development - termed Schwann cell
tumorlets - suggests that loss of NF2 gene function is necessary, but not sufficient for
schwannoma formation. Something similar to this has been noted in other tumor suppressor
syndromes such as retinoblastoma and Von Hippel Lindau Disease [Stemmer- Rachamimov
et al., 1998]. Immunohistochemical study of VEGF the pathway in VS has revealed a
dramatic decrease of proteins semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) and 3F (SEMA3F) expression in
tumors compared to normal nerves. SEMA3A and SEMA3F compete with VEGF ligand,
and their decrease is thought to be associated with VEGF pathway activation [Wong et al.,
2010]. An additional necessary change may be loss of SEMA which may contribute to an
“angiogenic switch”. The exact timing of this is not clear in humans, but in mouse models it
appears that Merlin deficiency contributes to SEMA3 loss of expression and to a pro-
angiogenic phenotype [Wong, 2010]. Tumorlets may thus provide us with a tool to
investigate the tumor progression in schwannomas and aid in the identification of new drug
targets and then to therapies that could halt tumor progression.

One major area of need is to standardize how tissue is prepared and stored after resection so
that this data that is currently underutilized can inform new treatment options. In 2011, the
Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF) NF Clinic Network will launch an NF BioBank to help
address this need.

INDUSTRY’S INTEREST IN NF2

Given the cost of clinical trials, engaging industry in the development of therapies for NF2
will be vital in order to advance treatments to the clinic. Interest in rare diseases in general is
on the increase in industry, with a number of entities establishing rare disease research units.
The Children’s Tumor Foundation has succeeded in attracting interest from industry through
the NF Preclinical Consortium and through the Drug Discovery Initiative Toolbox, an online
listing of drugs that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have made available to
NF researchers. Individual NF2 investigators have also formed successful collaborations
with industry to develop the clinical trials discussed. This growing success is a result of
several factors including: (1) a substantial unmet medical need for patients with NF2 as
there are no effective drug therapies for the tumors associated with NF2 and no optimal
standard of care, (2) significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular
underpinnings of NF2, providing potential validated targets for NF2 drug discovery and

development efforts, (3) NF2 preclinical models are now available to evaluate potential
therapeutics in order to efficiently plan clinical studies and, (4) successful development of
therapies for NF2 associated tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas) could
have significantly expanded market outreach given the high prevalence of these tumors
worldwide. In summary, the time is right for industry to engage closely in identifying and
advancing the quest for NF2 drug therapies.

SUMMARY

A recent surge in translational and clinical research on NF2 tumors -vestibular schwannoma,
meningioma, ependymoma and peripheral schwannoma - has culminated in the
commencement of the first clinical trials specifically for patients with NF2, with drugs
targeting major signaling pathways of interest including ErbB2, VEGF, PDGF, mTOR,
PI3K and AKT. NF2 clinical trials are employing a range of innovative clinical trial designs
thus far are focused on VS. For efficacy studies in VS, there is consensus that the current
optimal endpoints are change in word recognition scores, tumor volume or QOL measures.
As NF2 clinical trials expand it will be necessary to determine the most meaningful
endpoints for monitoring other tumor types such as meningioma and the various forms of
spinal tumors. It is clear that progress in NF2 clinical trials is made with close collaboration
between basic and clinical scientists. Translational studies, including the analysis of all
tumor samples from patients with NF2 accessed in the course of standard care, are an
important source of data to support the efficient discovery of new treatments for patients
with NF2.

Looking ahead, as the number of NF2 clinical trials grows, a NF2 clinical trial consortium
would provide a venue for reviewing preclinical, translational and clinical data to prioritize
agents to be advanced. This is a particularly vital practical measure in NF2 as without
centralized oversight, there are unlikely to be enough patients available to complete all of
the proposed studies. One exciting development is that the Phase II NF Clinical Trials
Consortium, established in 2005 with funding from the Congressionally Directed Medical
Research Program within the Department of Defense, is proposing to expand to offer NF2
specific trials. As the number of treatment options and active clinical trials continues to
grow, it will be crucial to maintain communication and organization across all subspecialties
that contribute to the care of patients with NF2 to ensure that all caregivers are well
informed about standard and experimental treatment options.

In summary, there are an increasing number of opportunities for identifying effective NF2
therapies. The NF2 community needs to remain focused on the importance of careful pre-
clinical screening of new agents utilizing meaningful tumor models and patient tumor
samples, engaging the biopharmaceutical industry, developing innovative clinical studies
that are cost and time efficient and building multidisciplinary collaborations between basic
and clinical researchers, clinicians and patients. If these tasks are vigorously pursued, it is
very likely that there will be new, effective therapies for patients with NF2 in the very near
future.
