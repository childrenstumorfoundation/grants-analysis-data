Abstract

Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (Alk) is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activated in several cancers, but with largely unknown
physiological functions. We report two unexpected roles for the Drosophila ortholog dAlk, in body size determination and
associative learning. Remarkably, reducing neuronal dAlk activity increased body size and enhanced associative learning,
suggesting that its activation is inhibitory in both processes. Consistently, dAlk activation reduced body size and caused
learning deficits resembling phenotypes of null mutations in dNf1, the Ras GTPase Activating Protein-encoding conserved
ortholog of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) disease gene. We show that dAlk and dNf1 co-localize extensively and
interact functionally in the nervous system. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of dAlk rescued the reduced
body size, adult learning deficits, and Extracellular-Regulated-Kinase (ERK) overactivation dNf1 mutant phenotypes. These
results identify dAlk as an upstream activator of dNf1-regulated Ras signaling responsible for several dNf1 defects, and they
implicate human Alk as a potential therapeutic target in NF1.

Introduction

tissues,

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins
with intrinsic kinase activity directed in part towards tyrosine
residues within their own carboxy-terminal
tails. They play
pivotal roles
including the central nervous
system (CNS), by transducing extracellular ligand binding events
into intracellular signals. A major signaling pathway activated by
RTKs is the Ras/ERK (Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase)
cascade [1–4]. Initially thought to be mostly involved in cell
proliferation and differentiation, recent work has increasingly
implicated various components and regulators of this signaling
cascade in neuronal plasticity and memory formation [4].
However, although most RTKs should, in principle, be able to
activate Ras/ERK signaling, only few among the 58 human
receptors have been functionally linked to cognitive processes
[5]. Even in Drosophila, a system with powerful genetics and
resident homologs of most mammalian RTKs [6], evidence
implicating these receptors in learning and memory remains
scant [5]. The linotte/derailed RTK (an ortholog of RYK) is the
only Drosophila family member implicated in learning and
memory to date [7]. However, deficits in adult neuroplasticity
associated with mutations in this gene appear at least partially

attributable to abnormal brain development [8]. In addition,
linotte/derailed is an atypical RTK, devoid of

activity. Evidence suggesting involvement of at least one typical
RTK in olfactory associative learning and memory in the fly
comes from work on Drk, an adaptor protein that binds active
tyrosine phosphorylated receptors [1,2]. Reducing Drk levels

learning

To identify RTKs potentially involved in Drosophila learning
and memory, we determined the family members which are
expressed in the adult CNS. The fly ortholog of Anaplastic
Lymphoma Kinase (Alk) was among genes showing prominent
expression in this screen. Vertebrate Alk, and its dAlk Drosophila
ortholog, are members of the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs,
[10,11]. Two related secreted proteins, pleiotrophin and midkine,
can activate vertebrate Alk, although whether they do so directly by
interacting with Alk, or indirectly by modulating the activity of a
transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, remains controversial [11].
As for most RTKs, Alk activation results in the recruitment of
adaptor proteins, such as IRS-1, Shc and FRS2 and initiation of
intracellular signaling pathways, including the canonical Ras/ERK
cascade [11,12]. Aberrant activation of

Author Summary

Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) syndrome is a common (1/3,000
births) genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems,
including the nervous system. Its clinical features include
short stature,
learning disabilities, and several types of
benign and malignant tumors. NF1 is caused by mutations
that inactivate the NF1 gene, a crucial negative regulator
of Ras signaling. Although unregulated Ras signaling is a
hallmark of NF1, the specific Ras signaling pathways
responsible for disease development
remain largely
unknown. The Drosophila and human Nf1 genes are
highly conserved; and, as in patients, mutant flies are
smaller than usual and present deficient learning. Here, we
identified the Drosophila Receptor Tyrosine Kinase dAlk as
a negative regulator of organismal growth and olfactory
learning. We show that excessive dAlk activation results in
growth and learning defects similar
to those of Nf1
mutants. Genetic suppression studies and pharmacological
inhibition indicate dAlk as a critical upstream activator of
Nf1-regulated neuronal Ras/ERK signals that contribute to
size determination and learning. Importantly, our results
strongly suggest
that Alk represents a novel, highly
specific, and promising therapeutic target in human NF1.

chromosomal translocations or point mutations has been causally
implicated in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-small cell lung
cancer, and neuroblastoma [11,13–17]. Alk signaling may also be a
rate limiting factor controlling the growth of glioblastoma cells [14]
and non-synonymous polymorphisms in the gene may be associated
with schizophrenia [18]. While recent reports have generated much
excitement about Alk as a therapeutic target in lung cancer [19], the
normal roles of vertebrate Alk remain poorly understood [11].

Drosophila dAlk functions in visceral muscle development in the
embryo [20–22], in axonal targeting in the retina [23] and in
synaptic signaling at
the larval neuromuscular junction [24].
Although the Drosophila miple1 and miple2 genes predict
pleiotrophin- and midkine-related proteins, the bona fide dAlk-
activating ligand is the secreted protein Jelly belly (Jeb) [11]. As
reported here, we found dAlk to be widely expressed in the adult
brain, but
the
mushroom bodies (MBs), neuronal structures essential for olfactory
learning and memory [25], where Drk is also preferentially
expressed [9]. Prompted by these observations, we investigated
whether dAlk functions in associative learning. Our results identify
dAlk as the first active RTK involved in olfactory learning, but
also in body size determination. Intriguingly, dAlk shares both of
these disparate functions with dNf1, the ortholog of the human
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene.

to be especially abundant

in the calyces of

NF1 affects 1 in 3,000 individuals worldwide and is the most
common genetic disease associated with an increased cancer
predisposition. Hallmark NF1 tumors are benign neurofibromas
and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Learning defects in
most children with NF1, skin pigmentation abnormalities, and
short stature are among other common symptoms of this multi-
system disorder. NF1 is caused by loss of function mutations in a
termed NF1, encoding an evolutionary conserved Ras
gene,
GTPase Activating Protein (GAP), termed neurofibromin. While
excess Ras signaling due to loss of neurofibromin is widely believed
to be responsible for most, if not all NF1 defects, no effective
therapy for any NF1 defect has yet been devised. Moreover, Ras is
a central component of multiple signaling pathways, and which of
these specifically contribute to disease development remains only
partially understood [26,27].

Alk Controls Neurofibromin Functions

Drosophila neurofibromin is approximately 60% identical to
the human protein, and dNf1 null mutants are viable, fertile, and
normally patterned, but reduced in size and defective in associative
olfactory learning and memory [28-31]. Previous work showed
that the size and learning defects reflect roles for NF1 in larval and
adult neurons respectively, and that loss of dNf1 is associated with
neuronal ERK overactivation [31]. However, no upstream
activator of dNf1 regulated Ras-ERK signaling has yet been
identified [32]. Here, we present evidence that dAlk functions as
an activator of dNf1-controlled neuronal Ras/ERK pathways,
responsible for defects in body size determination during larval
development and in olfactory learning in adult flies. Our results
argue that Alk may provide a therapeutic target for human NF1.

Results

dAlk regulates ERK activation in the adult brain

An expression profiling screen revealed robust expression of dAlk
mRNA in the adult CNS (data not shown; see Materials and
Methods for details). To confirm and extend this finding, adult
brain sections were immunostained with an anti-dAlk antibody
[33]. These experiments
identified prominent dAlk staining
throughout the neuropil, whereas cortical areas,
including the
regions occupied by mushroom body cell bodies, stained to a
much lesser extent (Figure 1A1-1A4). Particularly strong staining
was observed in mushroom body calyces (Figure 1A1), compared
to near background level staining in other mushroom body parts,
including the a, b and c lobes (Figure 1A3 and 1A4), or the
pedunculus (Figure 1A2). Other dAlk staining positive CNS
structures included the optic lobes (Figure 1A1 and 1A2), the
the antennal
protocerebral bridge (Figure 1A2),
the
lobes,
the medial
suboesophageal ganglion (Figure 1A3 and 1A4),
bundle and lateral horns
staining
similarly treated sections incubated in the absence of the primary
antibody did not reveal any signal, demonstrating the specificity of
the anti-dAlk antibody and of the staining pattern (Figure S4A).
The intense staining of mushroom body calyces may reflect a
specific accumulation of dAlk in dendrites, and the same dendritic
accumulation may be reflected by the neuropil staining.

Because homozygous dAlk mutants die as early larvae [33], we
used two independent RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenes and
to abrogate dAlk. Both AlkRNAi
the TARGET system [34],
transgenes were specifically expressed in the adult CNS with the
Elav-Gal4 driver (See Materials and Methods) and resulted in
significant reduction of dAlk (Figure 1B). To confirm the specificity
of dAlk immunostaining, we next abrogated dAlk expression
specifically in mushroom bodies, using the c772-Gal4 driver. This
resulted in a specific reduction of the dAlk signal in mushroom
body calyces, whereas staining in the remaining neuropil remained
largely unaffected (Figure 1C). In conjunction with the results in
Figure S4A, we conclude that the antibody is highly selective for
dAlk and that the AlkRNAi transgene allows effective ablation of
dAlk expression.

Previous work indicated that dAlk can activate ERK in larval
imaginal disks [33]. To determine whether the same is true in the
adult CNS, we analyzed phospho-ERK (p-ERK)
levels in flies
expressing various dAlk or Jeb transgenes. Transgenes designed to
enhance dAlk signaling included those encoding wild type (AlkWT)
[33], a constitutively active truncated form of the protein (AlkCA),
or the dAlk-activating ligand Jeb [23]. Conversely, the AlkRNAi
transgene, or a transgene encoding a dominant negative AlkDN
mutant [23], were used to block dAlk signaling. In addition to Elav,
we used the Ras2-Gal4 driver [31], which although not as
widespread,
is also expressed in the majority of CNS neurons

between controls and the two different UAS-AlkRNAi lines (p,0.004 and p,0.02 for UAS-AlkRNAi and UAS-AlkRNAiKK, respectively). Tubulin levels served

(Figure S1C and S1D). Phospho-ERK levels were significantly
elevated in head lysates of flies expressing AlkWT, AlkCA, or Jeb
under Ras2-Gal4 and reduced in flies expressing the interfering
AlkDN or AlkRNAi transgenes. Thus, dAlk modulates ERK activation
in the adult CNS, likely by engaging the Ras/ERK cascade, as
previously demonstrated for the vertebrate protein [11].

dAlk inhibits associative learning in the adult CNS

To investigate whether dAlk plays a role in associative learning
as suggested by its presence in the mushroom bodies, we again
used the TARGET system to modulate dAlk expression
specifically in the adult CNS, thus avoiding potential defects
stemming from its known developmental roles [22–24]. Surpris-
ingly, adult-specific pan-neuronal expression of wild type dAlk, its
constitutively active AlkCA mutant, or its activating ligand Jeb,
caused significant deficits
in associative olfactory learning
(Figure 2A-Induced). Because the only known function of Jeb is
to activate dAlk, it appears unlikely that the observed learning
impairment
is a non-specific consequence of expressing the
transgene ectopically. Moreover, it is unlikely that the attenuated
learning upon dAlk over-expression or over-activation is due to
ectopic expression, because the same effect was observed in
response to transgenic Jeb elevation. Interestingly, interfering with
endogenous dAlk activity with the dominant negative protein, or
attenuating its levels in the CNS by RNAi, did not precipitate
deficits, but rather reproducibly elevated performance (Figure 2A,
open bars, # p = 0.0016). Learning deficits were not observed in
flies raised at the restrictive temperature (Figure 2A, ‘Uninduced’),
and task-relevant olfactory responses and shock reactivity were
normal (Table S1).

Similar learning deficits were observed upon increasing dAlk
expression or activity using the Ras2 neuronal driver (Figure 2B).
Again, abrogating endogenous dAlk by expressing UAS-AlkRNAi, or
attenuating its activity with AlkDN in Ras2-positive neurons
yielded a modest, but significant (# p = 0.01) learning enhance-
ment (Figure 2B). To ascertain that these effects were not a
consequence of ectopic transgene expression, we generated a novel
Gal4 driver Alk(38)-Gal4. The pattern of Alk(38)-Gal4 expression
did not overlap precisely with endogenous dAlk distribution in few
tissues and cell
types as commonly observed with reporter
expression and may in part reflect differences in the localization
of dAlk and the mCD8-GFP reporter
in the membranes.
However, Alk(38)-Gal4 was abundantly expressed and largely
recapitulated the endogenous dAlk distribution in larval and adult
CNS (Figure S1A and S1B). Alk(38)-Gal4-mediated adult-specific
induction of
the above mentioned transgenes yielded similar
to those obtained with Elav and Ras2 (Figure 2C).
results
Therefore,
increased dAlk levels or signaling impairs olfactory
learning, whereas its attenuation improves it.

Both Alk(38) and Ras2-Gal4 are expressed in the MBs, neurons
that contain an abundance of dAlk in their dendrites (calyces).
Thus, we were surprised to find that expressing dAlk or Jeb
transgenes with the MB247 and c772-Gal4 MB drivers did not
affect associative learning (Figure 2D and 2E). It is unlikely that
the lack of effect is due to limited expression in the approximately
2000 MB neurons located in each adult brain hemisphere. In fact,
the MB247 and c772 drivers are expressed in 1600 and 1800 MB
neurons respectively and c772 in particular is also expressed in
a39/b39 cells [35]. Therefore, despite its obvious presence in the
calyces, dAlk does not appear to play a role in olfactory associative
learning in most, if not all, MB neurons.

Because enhanced learning is an uncommon phenotype [36],
we sought additional substantiation that dAlk inhibition caused
this effect. To increase assay resolution, we limited the number of

conditioned/unconditioned stimulus (CS/US) pairings, as de-
scribed previously [9]. Limited training with just 3 pairings also
resulted in enhanced learning when Alk was abrogated with the
Ras2 (Figure 2F), or Alk(38)-Gal4 drivers (Figure 2G), validating
this finding. Enhanced learning was also apparent after training
with 6, but not after the more intense 12 pairing training,
suggestive of a performance ‘‘plateau’’ [9]. We conclude that
inhibiting dAlk enhances performance after suboptimal training,
apparently by increasing learning per CS/US pairing. This
increased learning rate allows dAlk inhibited flies to reach a
performance plateau faster than controls. Thus, dAlk appears to
be a limiting negative regulator of olfactory associative learning
and surprisingly this function seems to involve neurons outside the
mushroom bodies.

dAlk activity in the developing CNS regulates body size
In contrast to the normal-sized animals obtained with use of the
TARGET system, we noted that pan-neuronal expression of wild-
the constitutively active dAlkCA throughout
type dAlk, or of
development yielded ,10%–15% smaller pupae compared to
isogenic controls (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained by
over-expression of Jeb, which again argues against an artifact
caused by ectopic dAlk expression, since Jeb should only activate
its endogenous dAlk receptor. Further arguing against a non-
specific effect, abrogation of endogenous dAlk activity by pan-
neuronal expression of the dominant-negative dAlkDN or AlkRNAi
transgenes yielded pupae that were ,10%–15% larger than wild-
type (Figure 3A). Except for these conspicuous size differences,
normally patterned and viable adults emerged from these pupae
(Figure S2). Driving the dAlk and Jeb transgenes with Ras2 and
Alk(38)-Gal4 caused similar size changes (Figure 3B and 3C).
Notably,
increasing the levels of wild type dAlk in neurons
normally expressing the protein with the Alk(38) driver resulted in
larval
lethality, suggesting that animals below a certain size
threshold are not viable, possibly because of neuromusculature
defects [22,24].

To further define the role of dAlk in body size determination,
we sought to identify the types of cells in the larval CNS where it is
required for this novel function. Therefore, we used 29 additional
Gal4-drivers to drive the dAlk transgenes in various CNS cell types
throughout development (Table S2). Body size was altered by
manipulating dAlk expression or activity in cells marked by the
peptidergic drivers 386Y-Gal4 (Figure 3D), c929-Gal4 and the
cholinergic Cha-Gal4 (Table S2). In contrast,
increasing dAlk
activity in glia, MBs, dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons did
not affect pupal size (Table S2). Interestingly,
transgenic Jeb
expression in glial cells, GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons
and the potentially peptidergic c316-Gal4-marked DPM neurons
[37], resulted in small pupae. These results are consistent with a
paracrine mode of action for Jeb as previously suggested [22,38].
Significantly, driving dAlk in Insulin-producing cells (IPCs), known
to be involved in Drosophila body size determination [39,40], also
had no effect (Figure 3E). This suggests that dAlk operates in a
different, potentially independent size determination system than
that requiring Insulin.

Measuring wing surface areas confirmed that flies with altered
body size possess proportionally sized wings (Figure 4A and 4B).
This likely reflects an altered size of the larval wing disk, and
agrees with the notion that dAlk is required in the larval CNS to
determine body size in a non-cell autonomous manner. To
determine whether size differences reflect changes in cell size and/
or cell number, we took advantage of the fact that each wing cell
produces a single hair, which provides a convenient way of
determining wing cell densities [41]. Comparing the cell densities

Alk Controls Neurofibromin Functions

of wings from Ras2-Gal4 driven transgenic flies to those of wild
type controls, we found that size alterations are largely due to
changes in cell size (Figure 4C) and not cell number (Figure 4D).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that dAlk and Jeb are novel
non-cell-autonomous regulators of organismal growth, affecting
cell size but not proliferation.

Growth of insects occurs exclusively during larval development.
Therefore, it was not surprising that pan-neuronal expression of
dAlk specifically in adult flies with TARGET did not modify their
size. Rather, it appears that the size-related function involves larval
neuroendocrine and cholinergic neurons. This conclusion is
supported by the spatial specificity of Gal4 drivers that modify
size (Table S2), as well as by the prominent dAlk immunostaining
(Figure 5A) in discrete parts of the larval ventral ganglion and the
central brain where neuroendocrine and cholinergic neurons
reside [42]. Notably, the Alk(38) driver is also expressed in these
areas of the larval ventral ganglion (Figure S1A).

Developmental attenuation of dAlk signaling in the CNS
reverses the body size deficits of dNf1 mutants

The size and learning defects observed upon dAlk over-
activation are highly reminiscent of phenotypes exhibited by
Drosophila dNf1 mutants [26,29–31,43]. An important goal of
Neurofibromatosis 1 research has been to identify upstream
activators of NF1 regulated Ras
signaling, which might be
exploited as potential therapeutic targets. To test whether dAlk
plays such a role, we compared dAlk and dNf1 expression
patterns, and we investigated whether the two genes interact
genetically.

In order for dAlk to function as an upstream activator of dNf1
regulated Ras signals, both proteins should at
least partially
colocalize. Using an antibody specific to dNf1 (Figure 5C), we
found that both proteins are broadly distributed in the larval CNS,
and colocalize extensively in the larval ventral nerve cord, the
brain lobes and particularly in the larval mushroom body calyces
and the developing adult visual system (Figure 5A). Both proteins
are also broadly present throughout the adult brain and show
similar extensive colocalization in mushroom body calyces, the
protocerebral bridge, mushroom body satellite neuropil and
ventral bodies (Figure 5B). Furthermore, both proteins appeared
in close proximity with the cell membrane in different neuronal
types (Figure 5 insets). To functionally test the colocalization of the
two proteins, we took advantage of the fact that loss of dNf1 also
results in a non-cell autonomous decrease in cell size yielding
overall smaller pupae [30,31] and adults (Figure S2). Targeted
re-expression of dNf1 in Alk(38)-Gal4-expressing cells reversed
the size deficit of Nf1-null mutants (Figure 6A) indicating that dNf1
is indeed required in dAlk-expressing cells. Thus, dAlk and dNf1
show widespread and extensively overlapping expression in
both the larval and adult CNS. Moreover, both proteins
appear to function in overlapping neuronal populations to non-
autonomously regulate organismal size.

To substantiate this conclusion, we evaluated functional
links between dAlk and dNf1 using genetic epistasis. Pupal size
in Alk1-null and Alk9-kinase-dead heterozygotes is normal (Figure 6B).
However, heterozygosity for either Alk mutant allele increased

significantly the small size of Nf1E2 homozygotes (Figure 6B). This
phenotypic suppression was a consequence of increased cell size
and not cell number (Figure S3A). Importantly, additional support
for the hypothesis that dAlk and dNf1 function in the same growth
regulating pathway was provided by pharmacological abrogation
of dAlk with the selective inhibitor TAE684 [44]. Feeding
1–10 mM TAE684 to homozygous null Nf1E2 larvae throughout
development rescued their size deficit. No phenotypic rescue was
observed at 100 mM, indicating a sharp concentration optimum
and perhaps
the higher
concentration (Figure 6C). Therefore, dAlk and dNf1 interact
genetically to determine pupal size.

were expressed with Elav, Ras2 and the more restricted 386Y-Gal4
in Nf1E2 mutants. All these manipulations caused larval lethality,
suggesting that further reduction of the already small size of Nf1E2
is not tolerated (crosses in Figure 6D). In agreement with this
interpretation, pan-neuronal expression of AlkWT and AlkCA in
Nf1E2/+
heterozygotes was also lethal, whereas Jeb expression
enhanced their slight size reduction to 70% of controls. The
Nf1E2/+
small size was also further reduced upon Jeb expression
with Ras2 and 386Y, but not with the MB-driver OK107-Gal4
(Figure S3B). Conversely, abrogation of dAlk signaling with AlkDN
or AlkRNAi resulted in Nf1E2 homozygotes with significantly larger
size, which approached control levels if driven with Elav. Driving
the same transgenes with Ras2 and 386Y-Gal4 also increased pupal
size, but to a lesser extent (Figure 6D). Similar attenuation of dAlk

size by dAlk abrogation is the result of increased cell size and not
cell number (Figure 6E). These results provide additional support
for the proposed functional interaction of the two proteins in size
determination. In contrast, dAlk abrogation in MB neuroblasts
and neurons with OK107-Gal4, or in CCAP-producing neurons
with CCAP-Gal4, did not alter Nf1E2 size (Figure 6D).

[31].

Increased ERK activity as a result of dNf1 loss in larval Ras2-
expressing cells has been proposed to result in the reduced body
size in mutant homozygotes
In agreement with this
hypothesis targeted expression of an activated form of ERK
(UAS-rlsem) [45] with Ras2-Gal4, yielded smaller animals with
wings that consisted of smaller, but not fewer cells (Figure S3C). If
our hypothesis that dAlk activates dNf1-regulated Ras/ERK
signaling is correct, then attenuating dAlk activity should reduce
the elevated neuronal phospho-ERK levels in Nf1E2 homozygotes.
Indeed, abrogation of dAlk levels or activity in Ras2-expressing
neurons of Nf1E2 homozygotes, restored phospho-ERK to control
levels (Figure 6F). Collectively, these results indicate that neuronal
ERK activity levels control Drosophila size, and that attenuation
of ERK over-activation by genetic or pharmacological reduction
of dAlk activity rescues the small size phenotype of dNf1 mutants.

Attenuation of dAlk rescues the deficient learning of
dNf1 mutants

Since dAlk (Figure 2) and dNf1 [29] both affect associative
learning independent of their developmental roles, we investigated

whether the two proteins interact
in neurons mediating this
process. Immunostaining revealed that dNf1 is distributed in the
adult brain in a pattern highly overlapping that of dAlk, exhibiting
coincident staining in mushroom body calyces and the proto-
cerebral bridge, among other regions (Figure 5B). Interestingly,
much like dAlk, dNf1 also appears conspicuously absent from the
pedunculus and lobes of the MBs (Figure S4). Others recently

reported the presence of dNf1 transcripts in mushroom bodies by in
situ hybridization [28]. Our results confirm and extend this work,
by providing the first documentation of the spatial distribution of
dNf1 protein in the adult brain including the MBs.

As previously reported for the dNf1P1 and dNf1P2 alleles [29],

fact, upon training with 3 CS/US pairings, even the heterozygous
null mutants exhibited a learning defect (Figure S5B). In support of
the notion that dNf1 and dAlk function in the same cells to
regulate learning, the learning defect of dNf1E1/E2 animals was
fully rescued by targeted re-expression of dNf1 within Alk(38)-
Gal4-expressing cells (Figure 7A). To investigate whether dAlk-
mediated signals are potentially regulated by dNf1 presumably
within Alk(38)-Gal4-expressing cells
in the adult CNS, we
attempted to dominantly suppress the learning deficit of Nf1E2
homozygotes by reducing the dAlk gene dosage, using the Alk1 null
and the Alk9 kinase-dead alleles. Either mutant allele improved the
associative learning of Nf1E2 mutants (Figure 7B), consistent with
the hypothesis that dAlk and dNf1 interact to mediate the process.
Importantly, acute inhibition of dAlk with TAE684 [44] in adult
Nf1E2 homozygotes nearly eliminated their
learning deficit
(Figure 7G, 10 nM and 100 nM, p = 0.0013 and p,0.0001
respectively, compared to vehicle-fed Nf1E2 flies). Similar to what
was observed in size rescue experiments, the pharmacological
response to acute TAE684 administration had a clear optimum in
the 10-100 nM range, whereas higher doses were ineffective
(Figure 7C). This pharmacological evidence strongly suggests that
dAlk-mediated signals engage dNf1 and are required for normal
associative learning in flies.

To determine the neurons where these proteins are required for
associative learning, dAlk was attenuated with AlkDN and AlkRNAi in
defined neuronal groups specifically in adult Nf1E2 homozygotes
(Figure 7D). If these transgenes remained uninduced, learning was

defective in these small-sized Nf1E1/E2 adults
(Figure 7D).
However, pan-neuronal expression under Elav-Gal4 completely
reversed the learning deficit of Nf1E1/E2, and this was also attained
with the Alk(38) and to a lesser extent with the Ras2 driver
(Figure 7D). Similar results were also obtained with a second
independent UAS-AlkRNAi transgene (Figure S5C).

Consistent with the data indicating a function for dAlk in
learning outside the MBs, rescue of the Nf1 learning deficit was
not observed with c772-Gal4 (Figure 7D). Importantly, over-
expression of a wild-type dNf1 transgene in mushroom bodies also
failed to improve performance of Nf1 mutants (Figure 7D last
graph, last column, p,0.0001 compared to control), arguing that
learning requiring dAlk and dNf1 does not directly involve these
neurons. This result was confirmed with additional mushroom
body drivers, MB247 (Figure 7E) and OK107 (Figure 7F).
However, as with Elav [46], both Alk(38) and Ras2-Gal4 which
rescue the learning deficit are expressed in the MBs (Figure S1).
Therefore, to unequivocally determine that dNf1 function is not
required within the MBs for associative learning, we performed
additional experiments using these drivers in combination with
MB-Gal80, which constitutively prevents transgene expression
specifically in the mushroom bodies [47]. Transgenic expression of
the dNf1 transgene under the pan-neuronal Elav driver resulted in
complete rescue of the associative learning deficits of Nf1E1/E2
animals (Figure 7G left side). Learning of Nf1E1/E2 animals was
also significantly improved when UAS-dNf1 was driven with
Alk(38) or Ras2-Gal4, consistent with the notion that dAlk and

dNf1 interact genetically within neurons expressing these drivers
to mediate associative learning (Figure 7G). These results confirm
that dNf1 is not required within the MBs for normal associative
learning. However, although significantly improved, learning of
Nf1E1/E2 flies with UAS-dNf1 driven with Alk(38) and Ras2-Gal4
did not attain control levels as under Elav-Gal4. This indicates that
Ras2 and Alk(38)-Gal4 may not be expressed in a subset of
Elav-Gal4 positive neurons where dNf1 is necessary for normal
associative learning and complete rescue of the learning deficits in
Nf1E1/E2 animals. Alternatively, the reduced rescue may reflect the
lower expression level of Alk(38) and Ras2-Gal4 compared with
that of Elav. In addition, full rescue of the Nf1E1/E2 learning deficit
was observed upon adult-specific dAlk attenuation in Alk(38)-
expressing neurons (Figure 7D), but not upon expressing a dNf1
transgene in the same neurons. A potential explanation of this is
that although dAlk functions outside the MBs, dNf1 may be
required both outside and inside these neurons
for normal
associative learning. Experiments to resolve this issue and to
define the minimal neuronal subset for full rescue of the deficit are
currently ongoing.

Discussion

The prominent expression of Alk in the mammalian and
Drosophila CNS [33,48,49] and presence of the dAlk ligand Jeb in
the embryonic fly CNS [38], provided the first indication that Alk
and Jeb likely participate in the development of the nervous
system. Subsequent in vitro studies demonstrated that Alk promoted
neuronal differentiation of PC12 or neuroblastoma cell lines, and

inhibition of presynaptic neuronal differentiation in vivo [11].
Several functions have also been attributed to Drosophila dAlk,
including roles in the specification of the intestinal musculature
[20–22], in retinal axon targeting [23], and in signaling at the
larval neuromuscular junction [24]. Our results establish two novel
in vivo functions for the Drosophila dAlk/Jeb receptor/ligand pair,
in the regulation of organismal growth and associative learning.

Roles for dAlk and dNf1 in body size regulation

The results presented here lead us to hypothesize that dAlk and
dNf1 have opposite roles in controlling neuronal ERK activity
during larval development, and therefore determine overall
organismal size in a non-cell autonomous manner. In support of
our hypothesis, dAlk and dNf1 co-localize extensively in larval
neurons, both proteins control ERK activity, and both modulate
growth by regulating cell size. In agreement with this conclusion,
transgenic neuronal expression of the constitutively active ERK,
RlSEM, is sufficient to reduce Drosophila size.

dAlk is the second active RTK implicated in Drosophila growth
control. Previous work demonstrated that the fly homolog of the
insulin/IGF1 receptor dInr, regulates both body and organ size
[40,41,50]. In peripheral tissues, dInr is activated by a family of
Insulin-like proteins (dILPs), leading to the activation of the IRS
(Chico), PI(3)K (Dp110), PTEN (dPTEN), and Akt/PKB, (dAkt1/
dPKB), signaling pathway. Ablating the Insulin Producing Cells
(IPCs), or silencing the function of dInr pathway components in
the larval CNS resulted in severe growth defects [40,41,50].
Notwithstanding
several
lines of evidence argue that dAlk and dInr control growth in

phenotypes,

growth

the

similar

fundamentally different ways. Most
importantly, organismal
growth is impaired when dInr activity or signaling is reduced,
whereas a similar phenotype is observed upon dAlk activation.
Secondly, dAlk affects organism growth by specifically regulating
cell size in a non cell-autonomous manner. In contrast, dInr
signaling affects both cell size and number cell-autonomously and
non-autonomously [40,50]. Finally, expression of Jeb or dAlk
transgenes in neuroendocrine IPCs using the dILP2-Gal4 driver
did not modify pupal size. Thus, although both dAlk and dInr
RTKs are involved in body size determination, their mechanisms
and sites of action are distinct. This interpretation is consistent
with results with the C. elegans Alk homolog Scd-2 shown to
function in parallel with or converge with TGF-b signaling, but act
independently of the Insulin cascade in dauer determination [51].
However, given that dInr and dAlk are members of the same
subfamily of RTKs, a potential explanation for the lack of rescue
of dNf1 mutant homozygous larvae with systemic administration of
100 mM TAE684 (Figure 6C), may be off-target inhibition of dInr
at the higher drug concentration [44].

Interestingly, S6K (dS6K) resides on a downstream branch of
the dInr/PI(3)K signaling pathway and regulates cell size without
impinging on cell number [41]. Although the dS6K loss-of-
function phenotype resembles the dAlk gain-of-function and dNf1
loss-of-function phenotypes, its mode of action is cell-autonomous.
However,
it is still tempting to speculate that dAlk and dNf1
ultimately affect neuroendocrine signals that affect dS6K activity
in peripheral tissues.

Increasing signaling through the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent
protein kinase A (PKA) pathway has been reported to suppress the
size defect of dNf1 mutants [30]. This among other findings, have
led some to propose that dNf1 regulates Ras activity and cAMP
levels independently [52,53]. In contrast, an investigation of the
cAMP/PKA sensitive dNf1 mutant growth defect argued that
aberrantly upregulated Ras/ERK signaling in Ras2-expressing
larval neurons was its proximal cause [31]. Our results further
support the latter explanation implicating a Ras/ERK signaling
defect downstream of dAlk as the cause of size defects in dNf1
mutants. Then, how could elevated cAMP/PKA signaling rescue
decreased body size? Because neuroendocrine signals can activate
the cAMP pathway [54], it is possible that defective dAlk/Ras/
ERK signaling in dNf1 mutants may lead to a neuroendocrine
deficiency, which is restored by increasing cAMP/PKA signals.

phenotypes we describe are the result of developmental alterations
in the CNS. In fact, dAlk seems to be acutely required for normal
learning as limiting modulation of its activity to the adult CNS

results in phenotypes on its own and also modifies the learning
deficits of dNf1 mutants. Moreover, the function of dAlk and dNf1
in associative learning is independent of body size as the learning
reverted to normal by dAlk abrogation in the small-sized dNf1
mutant homozygotes. Interestingly, the C. elegans Jeb homolog
Hen-1 is required non-cell autonomously in the mature nervous
system for sensory integration and associative learning [55].
Collectively then, these studies in C. elegans, mice [55,56] and our
data strongly support an evolutionary conserved role for Alk
signaling in adult associative learning and memory.

Elevated dAlk/Jeb signaling outside the MBs impaired olfactory
learning, while its abrogation increased learning efficiency. These
are results are consistent with the enhanced performance in a
hippocampus-dependent task described for Alk knockout mice
[56]. We propose then, that Alk signaling normally functions to
limit the strength of the CS/US associations, in effect providing a
putative threshold required to be overcome for specific and
efficient association of the stimuli. A GABAergic neuron outside
the MBs, the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL), was recently reported
to similarly suppress olfactory learning and its silencing yielded
enhanced performance [57]. Interestingly, a decrease in presyn-
aptic GABA release or abrogation of the GABAA receptor, RDL
in the post-synaptic mushroom body neurons [57,58] resulted in
enhanced learning. Whether Ras2-Gal4 is expressed in the APL
neuron and dAlk also functions in this neuron to suppress learning
are questions currently under investigation.

Interestingly, a recent study [59] suggested that the learning
+/2 mice are attributed to increased ERK-mediated
defects of Nf1
phosphorylation of synapsin I in hippocampal inhibitory neurons
and concomitant increase in GABA release. In accord, a GABAA
+/2 mice and controls,
receptor antagonist enhanced learning in Nf1
and reversed LTP defects in the mutants. Similarly, elimination of
the dAlk-mediating inhibition in Drosophila Ras2-expressing
neurons enhanced learning, potentially via attenuation of ERK
phosphorylation. In support of this notion, we show that constitutive
activation of ERK in adult Ras2-expressing neurons precipitates
learning deficits (Figure S3D). Collectively, these results together
with the reported learning deficits of Drosophila synapsin mutants
[60], suggest
that a mechanism similar to that proposed for
vertebrates may also regulate Nf1-dependent learning in flies.

In mice, a decrease in Nf1 levels in heterozygous mutants
increased Ras/ERK signaling and precipitated Long-Term
Potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning deficits [61]. These deficits
were reversed upon genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Ras
signaling [61,62]. Our own results demonstrate that dAlk
inhibition reversed the impaired learning of dNf1 mutants and
since this is the first ‘kinase-active’ RTK shown to be involved in
this process in flies [5], it provides independent support for Ras/
ERK hyperactivation as causal of these learning defects. Then,
how can the reported phenotypic reversal of Nf1 learning deficits
by expressing the PKA catalytic subunit throughout the fly [29] be
explained? We hypothesize that
the MBs are functionally
downstream of the dAlk/dNf1 neurons and elevated PKA activity
within the former could result in normal learning. Future work will
focus on addressing the merits of these hypotheses regarding the
mechanisms underlying the size and learning defects of dNf1
mutants.

A recent report [28] suggested that dNf1 mRNA is found in the
mushroom bodies and in agreement, our own immunohistochem-
ical results demonstrate that dNf1 is present within the mushroom
body calyces (Figure 6, Figure S4). Protein synthesis-dependent
memory defects in Nf1 mutants were rescued upon MB-limited
expression of the same full-length transgene as we used herein
[28]. Since we did not examine memory deficits in our work, this
complements our data and suggests a function for dNf1 within the
MBs. In contrast, our data indicate that dNf1 expression in the
MBs is not sufficient for learning/3 min memory (Figure 7G).
Three common MB drivers (Figure 7D, 7E, 7F) including the most
specific MB247 and the most broadly expressed OK107-Gal4 [35],
did not rescue learning in Nf1 mutants by expressing dNf1. We
suggest therefore that rescue described by Buchanan and Davis
was mediated largely by c739-Gal4 transgene expression in
neurons extrinsic to MBs where Elav, Ras2 and Alk(38)-Gal4 are
expressed, perhaps in combination with expression within MB-
intrinsic neurons. The neuronal circuits where dNf1 and dAlk are
required for normal
learning are the subject of ongoing
investigations.

A potential therapeutic role for Alk

Our study identifies dAlk as the first RTK to functionally
interact with Nf1 in Drosophila, raising the important question
whether a similar functional relationship exists in mammals.
Suggestive evidence argues that this may indeed be the case. Thus,
Alk and NF1 extensively colocalize in the mammalian CNS during
the same developmental periods [11,26,43]. Additionally, excess
Alk expression or activation has been reported in astrocytomas,
gliomas, neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas, in which loss
of NF1 expression has also been found [11,13–17,63]. Based on
our identification of Alk as a bona-fide RTK that initiates a Ras/
ERK cascade regulated by Nf1, this suggests that Alk inhibition
may rescue not only the phenotypes reported here, but also other
symptoms that have been previously associated with Nf1 loss and
ERK over-activation. It was recently reported that knockdown of
NF1 expression renders a neuroblastoma cell
line resistant to
retinoic acid-induced differentiation, and that NF1 deficient
neuroblastoma tumors have a poor outcome [64]. Our results
suggest that Alk inhibition may provide an intervention strategy in
such cases. Finally, the findings reported here, combined with the
lack of overt abnormalities in Alk knock-out mice [11,16,56],
provide a rationale for further explorations of Alk as a potential
therapeutic target in NF1.

Materials and Methods

Drosophila culture, strains, and genetics

Drosophila crosses were set up in standard wheat–flour–sugar
food supplemented with soy flour and CaCl2, and cultured at 25uC
and 50% humidity with a 12 h light/dark cycle. The Alk1 and Alk9,
dNf1E1 and dNf1E2 mutants have been described previously [22,31].
Transgenic fly strains used in this work were: UAS-AlkWT, UAS-Jeb,
UAS-AlkCA, UAS-AlkDN [20,23,33], UAS-AlkRNAi (Vienna Drosoph-
ila RNAi Center-11446), UAS-AlkRNAiKK (Vienna Drosophila RNAi
Center-KK107083), UAS-dNf1 [31], UAS-rlsem [45], UAS-mCD8::
GFP [65], Gal80ts [34]. The MB-specific Gal80 (MBGal80), which

drives expression predominantly in the MBs [47] was introduced
into the UAS-dNf1,dNf1E1 strain through standard genetic crosses.
All strains were backcrossed into the Cantonised-w1118 isogenic
background for six generations. The legend to Table S2 gives the
origin of all Gal4-driver lines used in this study.

RTK expression profiling in the adult brain

Dissected adult w1118 brains were submitted to Trizol-based RNA
extraction followed by oligo-dT primed Reverse Transcription as
described previously [66]. Amplification of cDNAs encoding
Drosophila RTKs was achieved with the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using a set of 21 distinct forward/reverse primers designed
with Oligo v6.71 software (Molecular Biology Insights Inc.), using
sequence information obtained from Flybase, Kinbase or NCBI
GenBank. We probed for the following molecules that contain an
RTK signature: dAlk, dTor, dRor, Nrk, sev, InR, btl, htl, Cad96Ca,
Pvr, dRet, dnt, drl, Drl-2, Eph, Ddr, otk, Tie, CG3277, dEgfr and
Wsck. All amplifications were performed in triplicate from two
different pools of dissected brains for 24 and 32 cycles. RTKs whose
cDNAs exhibited robust amplification at 24 cycles were selected for
further investigation of their distribution in the adult brain using
antibodies or reporter transposon insertions as available as a counter
screen. RTKs with unequivocal presence in the MBs, or other
spatial restriction in their distribution were selected for further
characterization. Additional details and results from this screen will
be presented elsewhere.

Generation of Alk-Gal4 driver lines

The Alk(38)-Gal4 transgenic line was constructed by fusing a
genomic region that includes the first (non-coding) exon and first
intron of dAlk, to a cDNA encoding Gal4, followed by the genomic
region downstream of the dAlk coding region encompassing the
39UTR. Firstly, a clone corresponding to the presumed promoter
region upstream of dAlk, was generated by PCR using genomic
DNA and the primers ALK-FOR and ALK-REV (for primer
sequences see below). These primers amplify a region extending
from the first (non-coding) exon of the adjacent upstream gene,
gprs, to 8 nt upstream of the ATG site of Alk (i.e. includes the first
exon, first intron and part of the second exon of dAlk). Secondly, a
Gal4 cDNA was amplified from the pChS vector using the Gal4-
FOR and Gal4-REV primers. Finally, the region encoding the
39UTR was amplified using ALK 39UTR-FOR and ALK
39UTR-REV. Each PCR product was TA-subcloned into
pCR2.1 and sequenced.

The final Alk-Gal4 construct was made in a modified
pCaSpeR1 vector containing the multiple cloning site of pBlue-
Script. Firstly, the upstream dAlk promoter was subcloned using
Kpn I and Bam HI. Next, the Gal4 coding region was subcloned
into the resulting construct with Bam HI and the orientation of the
insert was verified. Finally, the dAlk 39UTR was subcloned behind
the Gal4 coding region using StuI and NotI.

Drug feeding

The selective Alk inhibitor TAE684 [44] was provided by
Nathanael S. Gray, dissolved in DMSO and serial dilutions of
stock solutions were prepared. For pupal measurements,
the

solution was subsequently mixed into 10 ml fly food to make the
specific concentrations mentioned in the text. For behavioral
experiments, the solution was mixed into 10 ml dead-dry-yeast
paste and flies were fed for 48 h, and then transferred into normal
fly-food vials 1 hour prior to conditioning. Green food dye (two
drops per 10 ml) was added to monitor homogeneity and to ensure
that larvae or adult flies were actually ingesting the food. No
significant differences in the measurements of body size or learning
performance were observed in flies fed without DMSO (no vehicle)
or with DMSO alone (0 nM TAE684), confirming that DMSO
showed no adverse effects.

Morphometric analyses

significance. To allow for

Pupal size measurements were performed as described previ-
ously [31,41]. ,50 pupae of each genotype were digitally
photographed using a video-equipped stereoscope (Zeiss stereo-
scope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam CCD camera) and
measured using ImageJ software (NIH Image 1.45). Pupae were
then allowed to eclose, and scored for sex. Measurements for ,20
female pupae were used to calculate average size, standard
deviations, and statistical
slight
variations in experimental conditions, all controls were included
in each experiment. For cell growth analyses, ,20 wings of 20
different female flies of each genotype were dissected, placed on
slides and digitally photographed under the same magnification.
Images were captured as described above. ImageJ software was
used to measure wing-blade surfaces viewed at 40X magnification.
The size of intervein cells was obtained by initially counting the
number of hairs in a rectangle of 0.02 mm2 (cell density). In order
to maintain fair morphological comparisons, the location of the
rectangle was defined using wing vein landmarks (between veins 3
and 4 of the dorsal wing-blade, up to the posterior cross vein). The
reciprocal value of
the cell density gives the cell size. The
approximate number of cells in the whole wing was calculated by
multiplying the wing surface by the cell density. Similar results
were obtained with male flies. Experiments were replicated at least
once with flies from different crosses (biological replicates).

Behavioral analyses and conditioning

temporal

strains with Gal80ts

Behavioral tests were performed under dim red light at 23uC–
25uC and 70%–78% humidity. All animals were 2–6 days old,
collected under light CO2 anesthesia one day prior to testing, and
kept in food vials in groups of 50–70 at 23uC–25uC or 18uC as
appropriate for
restriction of
transgene expression. They were transferred to fresh vials
1–1.5 hours before testing. Olfactory learning and memory in
the negatively reinforced paradigm coupling aversive odors as
(CS+ and CS-) with the electric shock
conditioned stimuli
unconditioned stimulus (US) [67] was used to assess learning
and memory. The aversive odors used were benzaldehyde (BNZ)
and 3-octanol (OCT). For training, ,50 flies were placed into a
tube lined with an electrifiable grid and presented with air
(500 ml/min) for 15 s, the shock-associated odor carried in the air
current for 1 min concomitant with 1.25 second shocks at 90
V delivered every 5 s. This was followed by delivery of air for 30 s,
the control odor in the air current for 1 min, and air again for
30 s. The timing of stimulus delivery was kept proportional to that
for the full 12 CS/US pairing protocol, such that 3 shocks were
delivered in 15 seconds of continuous CS+ presentation, 6 pairings
within 30 seconds and so on. Two groups of animals of the same
genotype were trained simultaneously, one to avoid BNZ, the
other OCT, while the complementary odorant was used as the
respective control. The animals were transferred to a T-maze
apparatus immediately and allowed to choose between the two

the conditioning stimuli and represented half of

odors converging in the middle for 100 seconds. Since the time
between testing and the coupling of the conditioned with the
unconditioned stimulus is 3 min, the initial performance assess-
ment is that of 3 min memory, which we refer to as learning.
Performance was measured by calculating an index (PI), as the
fraction of
flies that avoided the shock-associated odor minus
the fraction that avoided the control odor reflected learning due to
one of
the
performance index. One performance index was calculated as the
average of the half-learning indexes for each of the two groups of
animals trained to complementary conditioning stimuli and ranges
from 100 to 0,
to no learning, respectively. All
behavioral experiments were carried out in a balanced design,
where all genotypes involved in an experiment were tested per
day. The experimenter was blind to the genotype. Behavioral
experiments were replicated at least once with flies from different
crosses and a different time period (biological replicates). For
experiments using the TARGET system (flies bearing Gal80ts), all
animals were raised at 18uC until adulthood and UAS-dAlk
transgenes were induced maximally by placing 3–5-day old flies at
30uC for 48 h. The animals were kept at the training temperature
(25uC) for 30 min before training.

for perfect

To assess olfactory avoidance, naive animals were given 100
seconds to choose between one of the odors and air. The airflow in
both arms of the maze was kept constant and equal to that used for
testing conditioned animals. Avoidance to both odors was tested
simultaneously for each strain and all strains used were tested in a
given session. Avoidance is represented by a performance index,
which is calculated as the fraction of flies that avoid the odorant
minus the fraction of flies that do not. To assess the avoidance of
animals to electric shock, the arms of the T-maze were lined with
electrifiable grids. Naive flies were placed at the choice point and
given 100 seconds to choose between an electrified and an inert
grid. Throughout the choice period, 1.25 s shocks at 90 V were
delivered to one arm and air was passed through both arms at the
standard flow rate. Avoidance is measured by a performance index
calculated as the fraction of flies that avoid the electrified grid
minus the fraction of flies that do not. Again, all strains were tested
in a given session.

Immunohistochemical analysis

For paraffin sections (Figure 1A), wild type animals were fixed in
Carnoy’s fixative (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid)
for 4 hr at room temperature, treated with methylbenzoate for
12 hr, and embedded in paraffin. 6 mm sections were obtained,
deparaffinized in xylene baths, rehydrated through 100%–30%
ethanol series, blocked for 1.5 h in 10% normal goat serum in
PBHT [0.02 M NaPO4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100
(pH 7.4)] and challenged with the rabbit anti-dAlk antibody
(1:1000) in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum in PBHT)
overnight at 4uC. The sections were washed in PBHT, and a 1:400
dilution of
in blocking
solution was applied at room temperature for 3 hr. Slides were
washed in PBHT and exposed to HRP conjugated to streptavidin
at a dilution of 1:400 in PBHT. After a final PBHT wash, the HRP
was reacted with a substrate solution of 1 mg/ml diaminobenzi-
dine and 0.03% H2O2 in PBHT. The unreacted substrate was
washed away with water and the slides were mounted with
Glycergel (DAKO).

the secondary antibody (Vector Labs)

Whole-mount larval CNS and adult brains were dissected in
cold PBS,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and
permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary
antibodies were used as follows: rabbit anti-dAlk (1:1,000) [33],
and mouse anti-Nf1 (DNF1-21)
[30]. The following

(1:5)

secondary antibodies were used: Goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit
conjugated with Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies (1:400, all from
Molecular Probes). Confocal
laser microscopy was performed
using a Leica TCS SP5 Confocal system equipped with the Leica
LAS AF image acquisition analysis software suite. Images were
processed using ImageJ 1.45 (NIH, Bethesda) software.

Western blot analysis

For detection of dpERK and total ERK levels, five adult heads
or
five larval CNS were homogenized in Laemmli buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Extract
equivalent to one adult head or one larval CNS was loaded per
lane and the primary antibodies were used at 1:2,000 for mouse
anti-pERK,
(Sigma), and 1:2,000 for rabbit anti-ERK (Cell
Signaling). Mouse anti-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybrid-
oma Bank) at 1:2,500 was used as an internal loading control. Four
independent experiments were scanned, the band intensities were
determined using ImageQuant 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics) and
used to calculate ratios of dpERK/ERK.

Statistical analysis

Untransformed (raw) data were analyzed parametrically with the
JMP 7.1 statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)
as described before [9]. Following initial ANOVA, planned multiple
comparisons were performed, using a = 0.05. The level of
significance was adjusted for the experimentwise error rate. Detailed
results of all planned comparisons mentioned in the figure legends
are shown in Table S3. Data are shown as mean 6 S.E.M.

rescue (p,0.0001 for all comparisons).

Over-activation of dAlk signaling further decreases the reduced
size of Nf1E2/+, but to a lower extent, which allows larvae to
survive and thus reach pupal stage. Note that inhibition of dAlk
signaling in heterozygous Nf1E2/+ mutants fully restored size
deficits. ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype for all
drivers tested (Elav- Gal4: F(4,259) = 677.12, p,0.0001,386Y-

comparisons showed significant differences between heterozygous
Nf1E2 flies and flies over-expressing dAlk transgenes (p,0.0001 for
Elav-Gal4, 386Y-Gal4 and Ras2-Gal4 for all genotypes). No
significant differences were observed between heterozygous
