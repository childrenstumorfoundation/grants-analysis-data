MEK inhibitors (MEKi) PD0325901 and AZD6244 (Selumetinib) are drugs currently under clinical investigation
for cancer treatment, however the Ras–MAPK pathway is also an important mediator of normal bone cell differ-
entiation and function. In this study we examined the effects of these compounds on endochondral processes
using both in vitro and in vivo models. Treatment with PD0325901 or AZD6244 signiﬁcantly increased Runx2
and Alkaline phosphate gene expression in calvarial osteoblasts and decreased TRAP+ cells in induced osteoclast
cultures. To test the effects of these drugs on bone healing, C57/Bl6 mice underwent a closed tibial fracture and
were treated with PD0325901 or AZD6244 at 10 mg/kg/day. Animals were culled at day 10 and at day 21 post-
fracture for analysis of the fracture callus and the femoral growth plate in the contralateral leg. MEKi treatment
markedly increased cartilage volume in the soft callus at day 10 post-fracture (+60% PD0325901, +20%
AZD6244) and continued treatment led to a delay in cartilage remodeling. At the growth plate, we observed
an increase in the height of the hypertrophic zone relative to the proliferative zone of +78% in PD0325901 treat-
ed mice. Osteoclast surface was signiﬁcantly decreased both at the terminal end of the growth plate and within
the fracture calluses of MEKi treated animals. The mechanistic effects of MEKi on genes encoding cartilage matrix
proteins and catabolic enzymes were examined in articular chondrocyte cultures. PD0325901 or AZD6244 led to
increased matrix protein expression (Col2a1 and Acan) and decreased expression of catabolic factors (Mmp13
and Adamts-5). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that MEKi treatment can impact chondrocyte
hypertrophy, matrix resorption, and fracture healing. These compounds can also affect bone architecture by
expanding the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate and reducing osteoclast surface systemically.

Introduction

The Ras signaling molecule is an important mediator of cell survival,
proliferation and function. The Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK axis (also called the
Ras–MAPK pathway) has a central role in cell signaling, and is activated
in many human cancers [1]. Activating mutations in the Ras superfamily
have been identiﬁed in approximately 15% of all human cancers, while
B-Raf mutations affect a number of tissue speciﬁc cancers [2]. MEK
plays a key role in transducing these upstream signals, and has thus
been a highly studied therapeutic target.

MEK inhibitors

(MEKi) PD0325901 (Pﬁzer) and AZD6244
(Selumetinib, ARRY-142886, AstraZeneca) are small molecule drugs
that can reduce tumor growth in preclinical xenograft models [3–6].

These compounds are undergoing clinical trials for treatment of a variety
of tumor types with PD0325901 being used for advanced stage cancers
(Trial ID: NCT01347866), and AZD6244 being used in over 50 trials in
oncology patients. To date, the adverse effect proﬁle has been limited
to nausea, edema, skin rashes, visual disturbances, fatigue and diarrhea,
which have been manageable and dose dependent [7]. The development
of speciﬁc and bioavailable MEKi compounds AZD6244 (Selumetinib)
and PD0325901 provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of
MEK signaling in skeletal biology. The potential impact of MEKi in bone
is of particular relevance to cancer patients as these treatments can
lead to bone loss and increased fracture risk [8,9]. In breast cancer
patients without bone metastasis or MEKi treatment, the incidence of
vertebral fractures was 5 fold greater than the normal population. In
women with recurrent breast cancer, the risk was 20 fold greater than
normal [9]. As these drugs progress through clinical development, a
better understanding of their skeletal manifestation is important. Three
registered clinical trials are focused on pediatric patients, yet limited
information is available regarding the role of MEKi on the developing
skeleton, skeletal homeostasis, and bone repair.

Fig. 1. MEK inhibition in calvarial osteoblasts and bone marrow derived osteoclasts. Calvarial osteoblasts were differentiated with rhBMP2 (100 ng/ml) and PD0325901 or AZD6244. RNA
was harvested at day 9 and expression of Alkaline phosphatase and Runx2 was quantiﬁed (A, B). Cells were then stained with Alizarin Red S for mineral and quantiﬁed (C). MEKi treatment
led to an increase in osteogenic potential. Bone marrow osteoclasts were differentiated using M-CSF and RANKL and co-treated with PD0325901 or AZD6244 for 8 days (D). A TRAP stain
for osteoclasts revealed that MEKi treatment reduced osteoclast numbers in the well. (*p b 0.05, **p b 0.01, ANOVA).

Endochondral ossiﬁcation is a key process involved with both skeletal
development and repair. During development, mesenchymal progeni-
tors are recruited and condense to differentiate into pre-chondrocytes.
Differentiation of pre-chondrocytes to chondrocytes is regulated by
the master regulator gene Sox9, in addition to Sox4 and Sox5 [10,11].
During this early phase of differentiation, chondrocytes express
collagen type I (Col1a1), and then secrete increasing amounts of collage
type II (Col2a1) and aggrecan (Acan) [11]. As chondrocytes continue
through the cell cycle, they begin to organize into columns of pro-
liferating chondrocytes, and eventually enter the terminal phase of

Fig. 2. Experimental design for targeted MEK inhibition during fracture healing. Mice were
treated with PD0325901 or AZD6244 at 10 mg/kg/day and assigned to one of the above
groups. Mice were treated continuously from days −2 to 21 post fracture with a MEKi
(black bar), or received vehicle treatment for the duration of the experiment (gray bar).
To determine the effects of the drugs on the different stages of healing, separate mice
were also treated from day −2 pre-fracture to day 10 post fracture (Early group), or
from day 10 to day 21 post fracture (Late group). Mice from all groups were sacriﬁced at
day 10 and 21 post-fracture for analysis.

differentiation and become hypertrophic chondrocytes [10]. Hypertro-
phic chondrocytes secrete high levels of collagen type X (Col10a1),
vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), and in the ﬁnal stages of
differentiation, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) [11]. The expres-
sion of Mmp13 and Vegf promote cartilage remodeling and invasion of
vessels that enable inﬁltration of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In the
ﬁnal stages of endochondral ossiﬁcation, the invasion of bone cells
replaces the cartilage with stronger trabecular bone.

Endochondral ossiﬁcation is a fundamental process that occurs dur-
ing development at the growth plates of all long bones, and contributes
to bone lengthening. This process is also recapitulated during fracture

Fig. 3. Cartilage formation in fracture calluses of MEKi-treated mice. C57/Bl6 mice were treated with PD0325901 or AZD6244 as deﬁned in Fig. 2 and underwent a closed fracture surgery to
assess healing dynamics. Mice were harvested at day 10 (A, B) or day 21 (C, D) post-fracture and cartilage area was quantiﬁed histologically. PD0325901 signiﬁcantly increased cartilage
formation at day 10 (A). Continuous treatment with a MEKi led to more cartilage at day 21 (C, D), while stopping at day 10 led to cartilage resorption by day 21 (Early group). Starting MEKi
treatment at day 10 (Late group) resulted in maintenance of cartilage at day 21 (C, D). (N = 3–10, *p b 0.05, **p b 0.01, ANOVA).

healing [12]. Fracture healing follows a sequential series of events: the
initial inﬂammatory reaction, the development of a cartilaginous soft
callus, followed by laying down of trabecular bone of the hard callus
(by endochondral ossiﬁcation), ﬁnally, the trabecular bone is remodeled
into stronger lamellar bone that takes the shape of the original bone [13].
In mice, the cartilage of the soft callus peaks at about 10 days, and the
trabecular bone of the hard callus peaks at about 21 days post fracture
[12,13].

Genetic mouse models have demonstrated the importance of the
Ras–MAPK pathway in chondrocyte and osteoblast cell differentiation
and function. Transgenic mice with inactivating or overactive mutations
of MEK driven by the osteocalcin promoter have yielded important
insights [14]. These studies intimated an important role for MEK in
promoting the bone forming activity of late stage osteoblasts where
osteocalcin is expressed. In contrast, inactivation of ERK1/2 (the down-
stream targets of MEK) using the Prx1 promoter (expressed in mesen-
chymal progenitors of the limb) promoted chondrogenesis at the
expense of osteogenesis [15]. Intriguingly, this mouse model showed
decreased RANKL expression in the humerus and tibia, indicating
decreased resorptive signaling. Furthermore, animal studies have
identiﬁed that ERK is highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes,
suggesting an important regulatory role [16]. Taken together, these
studies suggest that the Ras–MAPK pathway has an important role in
the speciﬁcation and differentiation of osteochondral progenitors as
well as the function of mature osteoblasts.

In this study we have evaluated the impact of AZD6244 and
PD0325901 on cultured cells, fracture healing, and in the growth plates
of mice. MEKi treatments were applied in vitro to osteoblasts,
chondrocytes, and osteoclasts. To address the role of MEK inhibition
on bone repair, mice underwent closed fracture surgery and were treat-
ed with PD0325901 and AZD6244 at 10 mg/kg/day using several dosing
regimens. Fracture specimens were analyzed by microCT and tissue
histology. To determine how these compounds may impact bone
growth, the growth plates of contralateral limbs were also analyzed.
Biochemical markers for bone turnover were also assessed.

Materials and methods

Calvarial osteoblast cultures

Calvarial cultures were generated from neonatal mice harvested
within one week of birth as previously published [17]. Brieﬂy, mice
were decapitated and the calvaria were washed in Dulbecco's PBS
while stripping any remaining ﬁbrous tissue. Calvaria were minced
and digested three times in Collagenase D at 1 mg/ml (Roche) in
αMEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min per digestion. The resulting
calvaria fragments were plated in 10% fetal bovine serum in αMEM
with penicillin/streptomycin and cells were allowed 3–5 days to grow
onto the plate before splitting for experiments. At conﬂuence, cultures
were differentiated with α-MEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin/

Fig. 4. Histology of fracture callus at day 21 post-fracture in MEKi treated mice. C57/Bl6 mice were treated with PD0325901 orally at 10 mg/kg. Mice were assigned to four groups as de-
ﬁned in Fig. 2. Mice were harvested at day 21 for histological analysis. Picrosirius Red/Alcian Blue stain revealed cartilage area in blue and Collagen I (bone) in red. Vehicle control samples
showed complete bony union with no cartilage callus present at this point. Continuous treatment led to cartilage islands, while the Early group had mostly resorbed, and the Late group

streptomycin, supplemented with 10 mM β-glycerophosphate,
50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 100 ng/ml of rhBMP-2 (Medtronic
Australasia). PD0325901 was dissolved in DMSO and added to the
differentiation media.

Induction of mineralization was established by staining for calcium
deposits in the well. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 min, followed by 5 minute incubation with Alizarin Red S (40 mM,
pH 4.2). Samples were washed three times with water and mineraliza-
tion nodules were quantiﬁed using a light microscope.

To examine osteogenesis, quantitative PCR was performed on a
Rotorgene LightCycler. RNA was harvested from cells using Trizol Re-
agent (Invitrogen), and cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). qPCR
was performed using a SYBR Green Mastermix (Stratagene) using the
following primer sequences: ALP-F 5′-GGGACTGGTACTCGGATAACGA-
3′, ALP-R 5′-CTGATATGCGATGTCCTTGCA-3′; Runx2-F 5′-AGCCTCTTCA
GCGCAGTGAC–Runx2-R 5′-CTGGTGCTGCGATCCCAA. Dissociation
curves using these primer pairs resulted in a single ampliﬁcation peak,
conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of these primers.

Osteoclast cultures

Bone marrow was harvested from the femur of C57/Bl6 mice aged to
8–10 weeks. The bone marrow suspension was ﬁltered using a 40 μm
ﬁlter, washed in PBS, and resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and an-
tibiotics. M-CSF (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems, MN, USA) and RANKL

(100 ng/ml; R&D Systems, MN, USA) were used to differentiate the
cells towards the osteoclastic lineage, and PD0325901 or AZD6244
were co-delivered as appropriate in the media. Cells were incubated
and differentiated for 8 days before performing a TRAP stain to assess
osteoclast numbers in the well as previously described.

Surgical methods

Female C57Bl6 mice aged ~11 weeks were used in closed fracture
surgery experiments. All fractures were generated at the tibial mid-
shaft (near the ﬁbular junction) by experienced staff based on our pub-
lished methodology [18]. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine
(35 mg/kg) and xylazine (4.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection
with a 27-G needle and maintained using inhaled isoﬂurane. Next a
small incision was made slightly below the knee and an entry point
made using a 27-G needle. An intramedullary rod (a 30-G needle or a
0.3 mm-diameter stainless steel insect pin) was surgically inserted
inside the medullary canal of the tibia, and a second pin inserted for
stability. A non-comminuted, transverse fracture near the ﬁbular
junction was conﬁrmed via radiography using a digital X-ray ma-
chine (Faxitron X-ray Corp., Wheeling, IL). The wound was closed
using 5–0 nylon suture (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ). The mice
were allowed to recover on a heated pad and then placed in recovery
cages. Pain was managed using buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg subcuta-
neously postoperatively, then every 12 h as required) and dehydration

PD0325901 or AZD6244. Mouse fractures were harvested at day 21 and TRAP stained for osteoclasts. Treatment with PD0325901 or AZD6244 led to a signiﬁcant reduction in osteoclast
number and surface in the continuous or late treatment groups (black bars). Treatment in the early group was stopped 11 days before harvest, and the osteoclast levels began to return to
normal (gray bars). (*p b 0.05, **p b 0.01, ANOVA, N = 5).

was controlled via post-operative i.p. injection with 1 ml sterile sa-
line. Fracture repair was monitored by weekly radiography
(Faxitron X-ray) and in the event where internal ﬁxation had failed
(due to pin slippage, bending or breakage) the affected mouse was
culled and excluded from subsequent analysis. At the experimental
endpoints, animals were euthanized using carbon dioxide and spec-
imens collected post-mortem for radiography and histology. All
animal experiments were undertaken with approval from the local
animal ethics committee.

Treatment with PD0325901 or AZD6244

Mice were single housed prior to the beginning of the experiment,
and they were trained to eat a strawberry jelly as drug vehicle. This
jelly was composed of 0.8% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
16% Splenda® (Splenda® Low Calorie Sweetener, Johnson-Johnson Pa-
ciﬁc Pty, NSW, Australia), 9.6% gelatine (Davis Gelatin, GELITA Australia
Pty, NSW, Australia) and 7.9% ﬂavoring (QUEEN Flavoring Essence Imi-
tation Strawberry, Queen Fine Foods Pty, QLD, Australia). The jelly was
given to the mice with or without PD0325901 (Selleck Chemicals, TX,
USA) or AZD6244 (Chemietek, IN, USA) dissolved in DMSO. This method
of administration proved very effective at drug delivery, and reduced
the stress normally associated with oral gavage. Single-housing of the
mice assured that the jelly was being consumed at the appropriate
dose. This method has been previously described [19].

Histological analysis

Fractured tibiae were removed along with the surrounding soft
tissues, ﬁxed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stored in
70% alcohol at 4 °C prior to decalciﬁcation. For growth plate analyses,
the contralateral femora were removed and processed in a similar fash-
ion. Bone samples were decalciﬁed in 0.34 M EDTA (pH 8.0) for 21 days
at 4 °C on shaker with changes every 2–3 days. Samples were embed-
ded in parafﬁn blocks and 5 μm-thick sections were cut and stained
with Picrosirius Red/Alcian Blue to stain for bone and cartilage, and
counterstained with Harris Hematoxylin. Adjacent sections were

quantiﬁed and analyzed using Bioquant Analysis System (Nashville, TN,
USA). One section per biological sample was analyzed, and for histology,
the values were normalized to tissue area. These methods have been
previously published [17,18].

Serum RANKL and OPG

Blood was collected via cardiac puncture of C57/Bl6 animals at
the experimental endpoint. Blood was allowed to clot for 30 min
at room temperature before centrifugation. The serum was stored at

thawed and assayed using the RANKL or OPG kits supplied by R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, USA).

Under sterile conditions full depth articular cartilage was removed
from the femoral and tibial surfaces of skeletally mature (2–3 year

with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Ausgenex, Brisbane, Australia)
for 2 h at 37 °C. Tissue was then washed and digested with 0.05%
collagenase (Sigma) in DMEM/F12 with 10% FCS overnight at 37 °C
with agitation. Cells were then cultured (replicate cultures for each
analytical point) in fresh media with or without interleukin-1-alpha

Sample size for each experiment is indicated in the appropriate

Results

MEK inhibition promotes osteoblast differentiation and suppresses
osteoclast formation in vitro

To determine the effect of MEK inhibition on osteoblasts, primary
calvarial osteoblasts were cultured in the presence of the potent bone
anabolic factor rhBMP2 (100 ng/ml) and two different MEKi com-
pounds, PD0325901 and AZD6244 (Selumetinib). Cells were treated
for nine days, and RNA was harvested to examine the expression of
Runx2 and Alkaline phosphatase (Alp), two important osteoblastic
markers (Figs. 1A, B). Quantitative PCR for Runx2 and Alp expression
revealed that PD0325901 and AZD6244 were able to promote
osteoblastogenesis in a dose dependent manner at 10 nM and 100 nM
(Figs. 1 A, B). Additionally, cultures were stained with Alizarin Red
S for mineralized nodules, which were subsequently quantiﬁed
(Fig. 1C). Four days after treatment with PD0325901, we saw a large
and signiﬁcant increase in the number of mineralized nodules
compared to DMSO vehicle. At this time point and concentration,
AZD6244 did not impact mineralization suggesting it may be less potent
than PD0325901 (Fig. 1C).

To understand the role of MEK in osteoclastogenesis, hematopoietic
progenitors from the bone marrow were differentiated in the presence

of recombinant MCSF and RANKL. Cells were incubated with AZD6244
or PD0325901 at 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM, and cultured for 8 days.
Osteoclast differentiation was quantiﬁed by TRAP stain (Fig. 1D). MEK
inhibition using either compounds led to a decrease in the number of
TRAP positive osteoclasts. PD0325901 showed a greater potency than
AZD6244, with 100 nM AZD6244 reducing osteoclasts with a compara-
ble efﬁcacy to 10 nM of PD0325901.

Taken together, these data suggest that MEKi treatment can play an
important role in bone formation and bone resorption. Therefore, in the
following series of experiments, we evaluated the role of these inhibi-
tors in fracture healing.

MEK signals modulate progenitor differentiation in endochondral fracture
repair

C57Bl6 mice underwent a closed fracture surgery on the tibia, and
PD0325901 or AZD6244 was administered orally at 10 mg/kg/day dur-
ing the different stages of fracture healing. No adverse effects were re-
ported at this dose, and mouse weight was not affected. Mice were
treated in the (1) early phase of repair during hematoma and soft callus
formation; in the (2) late phase during establishment of the hard callus
and its subsequent remodeling; or (3) continuously throughout the
healing process (Fig. 2). Animals were harvested 10 and 21 days post

fracture for analysis of the femur, fracture callus, and serum biochemis-
try. Animals harvested at day 10 post fracture received a total of 13
doses, while animals in the continuous group received 24 doses by
day 21 time point.

Fractures were analyzed by microCT 21 days post-fracture to
quantify the mineralized bone volume in the fracture callus (Table 1).
Continuous treatment with either PD0325901 or AZD6244 resulted in
a signiﬁcant increase in BV/TV (bone volume relative to tissue volume).
With PD0325901 the total callus BV (bone volume) was increased, but
not signiﬁcantly so; in AZD6244 treated animals the callus BV showed
a 20–23% reduction (p b 0.01), but this was also associated with reduc-
tions in (TV) tissue volume of 27–32% (p b 0.05). To further analyze the
calluses, detailed histology was assessed at day 10 and day 21 post-
fracture.

Day 10 specimens revealed a signiﬁcantly greater cartilage area
when treated with PD0325901 compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 3A).
Treatment with AZD6244 also produced a trend towards increased car-
tilage but this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 3B). This time
point represents the peak cartilage formation step during fracture
healing, suggesting early MEKi treatment promoted the accumulation
or formation of cartilage. Day 21 specimens similarly showed consider-
able and statistically signiﬁcant retention of cartilage with continuous
MEKi treatment with either PD0325901 or AZD6244 (Figs. 3C, D).
Mice treated with MEKi after the establishment of the cartilaginous
soft callus (Late group, days 10–21) showed an increase in the amount
of cartilage remaining (Fig. 3). This cartilage appeared characteristically
hypertrophic and mineralized (Fig. 4). The effects on cartilage retention
of d10–21 treatment were more pronounced with PD0325901 treat-
ment than with AZD6244 (Fig. 3). In contrast, cessation of MEKi treat-
ment after day 10 (Early group, days −3–10) led to negligible residual
cartilage remaining by day 21 (Fig. 3). These data indicate that MEK in-
hibition may impact chondrocyte terminal differentiation and cartilage
resorption.

MEK inhibition reduces osteoclastogenesis in the fracture callus

In fracture healing, osteoclasts are critical for remodeling of the hard
callus, effects of MEKi on osteoclastogenesis were hypothesized based
on cell culture data in vitro. A stain for tartrate-resistant acid phospha-
tase (TRAP) for osteoclasts was performed and signiﬁcant effects were
seen at 21 days with MEKi treatment. Treatment with PD0325901
(Continuous) resulted in a 43% decrease in osteoclast surface
(p = 0.03) (Fig. 5A). These effects were reversible, as PD0325901
(Early) showed no difference. Mice treated with AZD6244 (Continuous)
also showed a signiﬁcant 21% decrease in osteoclast surface
(p = 0.005) (Fig. 5C). However, unlike PD0325901 (Early), AZD6244
(Early) showed a persistent decrease even after 11 days (Fig. 5D). This
was not associated with signiﬁcant changes in BV or BV/TV in the bone
below the growth plate as measured by microCT (data not shown).

Serum was collected from animals treated with AZD6244 at day 10
and at day 21 post-fracture and analyzed for RANKL and OPG biochem-
istry. 10 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg of AZD6244 produced a 42%
reduction in circulating RANKL (Table 2) and no change in OPG. Intra-
mouse variability was high and this difference did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. 21 days of AZD6244 treatment led to a statistically signiﬁ-
cant reduction in RANKL (25%, P b 0.05), but also comparable reduction
in OPG. These data suggest the changes in osteoclast surface at the frac-
ture site may reﬂect differences in the local fracture microenvironment
rather than systemic changes in bone resorption.

MEK inhibition maintains hypertrophic chondrocytes at the growth plate

The growth plates from the animals that underwent fracture surgery
were also analyzed to help elucidate what stage of cellular differentia-
tion MEKi treatment may inﬂuence. The specimens examined were
either treated with MEKi for 13 days, 24 days, or 13 days with a
wash-out period of 11 days. Growth plates were analyzed by compari-
son of the proliferative zones and hypertrophic zones. The hypertrophic
zone was signiﬁcantly expanded with 13 or 24 days PD0325901 treat-
ment (Figs. 6A, B). The proliferative zone was correspondingly de-
creased,
leaving the total growth plate length unchanged with
treatment. After the 11 day washout period, no difference in hypertro-
phic zone was seen, suggesting the effects were reversible over the
time period studied. In contrast, AZD6244 was not found to signiﬁcantly
affect the growth plate (Fig. 6C).

To determine whether osteoclasts were affected below the growth
plate of these animals, a TRAP stain was performed in the primary
spongiosa. In mice treated with PD0325901, osteoclast number and sur-
face were signiﬁcantly reduced after 13 and 24 days, but again was re-
versible with 11 day washout (Figs. 7A, B). In contrast, the trend
towards reduced osteoclast number and surface did not reach sig-
niﬁcance in animals treated with AZD6244 (Figs. 7C, D) except in
13 day treatment/11 day washout group. This suggests some under-
lying differences in impact on osteoclasts and reversibility between
the two agents.

MEK inhibition affects expression of matrix factors and catabolic enzymes
in cultured chondrocytes

Based on the fracture healing and growth plate data, it was hypoth-
esized that the skeletal effects of MEKi may mechanistically involve ef-
fects on cartilage matrix production and breakdown. This was further
examined in vitro using sheep articular chondrocytes treated with
PD0325901 and AZD6244. These cells were selected because they can
be induced to strongly increase expression of catabolic enzymes with
interleukin treatment.

MEKi treatment with 100 mM PD0325901 and 100 mM AZD6244
led to signiﬁcant increases in the cartilage-speciﬁc matrix genes
Collagen-2 (Col2a1) and Aggrecan (Acan). Collagen-1 (Col1a1), a marker
of chondrocyte de-differentiation, was not affected by PD0325901 and
more modestly increased by 100 mM AZD6244 (Figs. 8A–C). Treatment
of chondrocytes with IL-1 resulted in signiﬁcant decreases in the gene
expression of Col1a1, Col2a1, and Acan (Figs. 8A–C). MEKi treatment
led to partial rescue of genes encoding matrix proteins, with the most
potent effects on Col1a1.

Expression of cartilage degrading enzymes Adamts-4 (a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4), Adamts-5, and
Mmp13 was quantiﬁed. MEK inhibition led to signiﬁcant decreases in
Adamts-5 and Mmp13 expression, even with 1 mM PD0325901 and
1 mM AZD6244 (Figs. 8D–F). Consistent with the articular chondrocyte
culture model, 1 ng/ml IL-1 treatment dramatically increased expres-
sion of genes encoding these enzymes, in some cases by several orders
of magnitude. While Adamts-4/5 expression were unchanged or slightly
increased by the MEKi compounds (Figs. 8E–F), Mmp13 expression was
signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 8D).

Overall, these data indicate that MEKi compounds can increase the
expression of speciﬁc cartilage matrix genes while decreasing Mmp13
expression, which would favor the accumulation and retention of
cartilage.

Fig. 8. MEKi compounds regulate chondrogenesis. Sheep articular chondrocyte explant cultures were grown for 24 h in the presence of IL-1, PD0325901 (gray bars) or AZD6244 (black
bars). mRNA was harvested for quantitative PCR of anabolic makers (A–C; Collagen 1 and 2, Acan, respectively), and catabolic markers (D–F; Mmp13, Adamts-4 and 5, respectively).
MEKi treatment consistently increases anabolic markers with or without treatment of IL-1 (A–C). MEKi treatment also inhibited catabolic enzymes when IL-1 was not delivered.
Mmp13 was reduced when cells were treated with IL-1 and a MEKi (D). (N = 6, t-test, *p b 0.05 compared to untreated control; τ p b 0.05 compared to IL-1 treatment alone).

Discussion

J. El-Hoss et al. / Bone 59 (2014) 151–161

The effects of MEK inhibition on bone cells

Numerous in vitro studies have attempted to evaluate the role of the
Ras–MAPK pathway in bone cells, although a clear consensus has not
yet been reached [22]. The use of older MEKi compounds such as
PD98059 or U0126 have been a useful guide, but these compounds
are less speciﬁc that PD0325901 or AZD6244 [23,24]. In C2C12 muscle
cells and MC3T3 pre-osteoblastic cells, PD98059 were found to promote
osteoblastogenesis synergistically with rhBMP2 [25]. Chondrogenic
micromass cultures treated with PD98059 or U0126 show increased ex-
pression of Acan and Col2a1, suggesting that they promote chondrogen-
esis [26]. Our in vitro experiments with these highly speciﬁc inhibitors
indicate that the Ras–MAPK pathway is a negative regulator of osteo-
blast maturation. MEK inhibition led to a greater relative increase in
chondrocyte gene expression markers than in osteoblasts markers.
This suggests that chondrocytes are more sensitive to variations in
Ras–MAPK activity than osteoblasts.

The effects of MEK inhibition on bone repair

Fracture healing can be temporally divided into an inﬂammatory
phase, a soft callus phase, a hard callus phase, and a remodeling phase,
although these stages show some overlap [13]. The bone repair process
involves the coordination of multiple cell types to restore normal bone
shape and function. Our data reveals that treatment with PD0325901
or AZD6244 can signiﬁcantly impair the endochondral ossiﬁcation in a
fracture callus. Peak cartilage was increased with PD0325901, cartilage
remodeling was decreased, and the number of osteoclasts in the callus
was decreased. Treatment with AZD6244 did not result in a signiﬁcant
increase in peak cartilage at day 10, but at day 21, we observed a
signiﬁcant increase in cartilage, suggesting impairment of cartilage
resorption. The effects of PD0325901 and AZD6244 treatments were ex-
amined by microCT, and differences in bone parameters with MEKi
treatment were noted. Based on the histology, it is possible that reten-
tion of mineralized cartilage may underlie some of the changes in BV/
TV detected using this modality.

Serum samples revealed that the RANKL to OPG ratio was not
changed with MEKi treatment, despite a change in osteoclast surface/
bone surface. This is likely because RANKL is secreted by osteocytes em-
bedded in the matrix to regulate osteoclasts locally, rather than through
systemic osteoclast regulation [27]. While osteoclast surface/bone
surface was signiﬁcantly reduced, we did not observe a signiﬁcant effect
on osteoclast number/bone surface, and this may be due to a lack of
statistical power for this parameter (Fig. 5).

The process of cartilage remodeling during endochondral ossiﬁ-
cation is normally undertaken by osteoclasts as well as other cell
types that secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Insight into
the cells that can participate in endochondral remodeling have
been elucidated by several recent studies. Treatment with the
MMP inhibitor MM1270 led to the accumulation of cartilage in a
rat fracture model. In contrast, treatment with bisphosphonates
(which abrogate osteoclast-mediated resorption) or OPG (which
blocks osteoclast formation) activity lead to increased bone mineral
content due to delayed hard callus remodeling, but no delay in
cartilaginous/soft callus remodeling [28]. Analogously, Mmp9 or
Mmp13 knockout mice that underwent a fracture surgery show de-
layed cartilage remodeling, and a persistent cartilaginous fracture
callus [29,30]. These experiments indicate that the primary mecha-
nism of cartilage remodeling during fracture healing is through the
action of MMPs, which can be expressed by a range of cell types
and not solely osteoclasts. Critically, our in vitro evidence from artic-
ular sheep chondrocytes treated with either PD0325901 or AZD6244
showed an inhibition of Mmp13 expression.

The effects of MEK inhibition on chondrocytes and cartilage

This study is the ﬁrst to document the effects of either PD0325901 or
AZD6244 on the growth plate and during fracture healing. Previous
studies have successfully used PD0325901 at 20–50 mg/kg in mouse
tumor xenograft models [4,31]. We dosed mice with 10–25 mg/kg
using a published oral delivery method that reduces gavage-induced
stress [19]. In a dose ﬁnding study, we had a 15% death rate after eight
day treatment for mice that had undergone a fracture and treated
with PD0325901 at 25 mg/kg/day (data not shown). Therefore, we re-
duced the dose to 10 mg/kg, which has been suggested to be the clini-
cally relevant equivalent in mice for PD0325901, and did not observe
any toxicity [32]. We observed an expansion of the hypertrophic
zone in the MEKi treated mice, but the overall growth plate length
was not changed. Therefore, the hypertrophic zone was expanded at
the expense of the proliferative zone, suggesting that proliferative
chondrocytes may be prematurely differentiating into hypertrophic
chondrocytes. MEK inhibition using U0126 was shown to have direct
impacts on hypertrophic chondrocytes. Inhibition of pERK using
U0126 was associated with reduced hypertrophic chondrocyte apopto-
sis in culture, and a concomitant increase in the hypertrophic zone of
the growth plate in mice [33]. Notably however, PD0325901 has also
been shown to increase serum phosphate levels [34], and this can be as-
sociated with increases in hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis [33].

Chondrocyte cultures revealed that MEKi could decrease Mmp13
expression, and this could underlie expansion of the hypertrophic
zone. Mmp9 and Mmp13 knockout mice are reported to display an ex-
pansion of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, but this is also ac-
companied by a longer growth plate [35]. Mechanistic studies have
demonstrated that the effects of Mmp13 at the growth plate are predom-
inantly due to a reduction in matrix turnover, rather than a change in
hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation or apoptosis [36]. Some reduc-
tions in osteoclast parameters were noted at the level of the growth
plate, but this is unlikely to perturb proliferative or hypertrophic chon-
drocyte differentiation. In Rankl−/− mice that lack osteoclasts, the expan-
sion of the growth plate and hypertrophic zone was associated with
reduced matrix turnover, but chondrocyte differentiation was not im-
pacted. As the MEKi treated mice do not show a change in growth
plate length, we posit the hypertrophic zone expansion is not primarily
caused by direct effects on MMP expression or osteoclasts. Most likely,
these effects are secondary to direct effects of MEKi on chondrocyte
differentiation.

In summary, we speculate that the impact of PD0325901 on the
growth plate may be mediated through (1) premature differentiation
of proliferating chondrocytes, (2) direct anti-apoptotic effects on hyper-
trophic chondrocytes, and (3) a protective effect from serum phosphate
levels, which has been reported with PD0325901 [34]. These effects of
MEKi treatment on the growth plate and on hypertrophic chondrocytes
may warrant further examination in pediatric patients that are being
administered these drugs in clinical trials.

Study limitations

Both of these MEKi compounds are currently in clinical development
to treat cancer [37–39]. The data presented from this study provide ev-
idence that support an important role for the Ras–MAPK pathway in
fracture healing and skeletal remodeling. We showed that PD0325901
and AZD6244 were capable of promoting cartilage formation during
fracture healing, and delaying cartilage matrix resorption, resulting in
altered endochondral ossiﬁcation at the growth plate and fracture cal-
lus. The in vitro data suggests that MMP-13 inhibition may be the mech-
anism for delayed cartilage remodeling. The use of two MEK inhibitors
at the same dose conﬁrms the speciﬁcity of the effects on the MEK path-
way, and allows a dosage comparison that is relevant for future studies.
We did not speciﬁcally assess angiogenesis, which is also an impor-
tant process for endochondral ossiﬁcation that may be affected by MEK

inhibitors. The impact of these compounds on articular cartilage was not
assessed either, though the in vitro data was highly informative. Finally,
the long-term impact of MEKi compounds on the growth plate remains
to be evaluated, since our results only reﬂect three weeks of treatment.
The reversibility of the effects is promising, however.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate an important role for MEK signaling in the
maintenance of cartilage and in endochondral bone repair. As MEKi
compounds progress through clinical trials, evidence about how they
impact the skeleton is essential, particularly in growing children or pa-
tients who sustain a fracture. Future studies may identify new ways to
utilize this new class of drugs to modulate cartilage turnover and
differentiation to improve bone and joint health.
