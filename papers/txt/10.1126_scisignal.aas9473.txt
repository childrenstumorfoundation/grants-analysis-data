EGFR-induced cytoskeletal changes drive complex  
cell behaviors: The tip of the iceberg

Christine Chiasson-MacKenzie* and Andrea I. McClatchey*

Cytoskeletal networks are dramatically reorganized upon EGF stimulation to enable complex cell behaviors such 
as cell-cell communication, migration and invasion, and cell division. In this issue of Science Signaling, Roth et al. 
and Pike et al. use proteomic methods to identify several effectors of EGF responses. The findings show the inter-
dependent nature of growth factor signaling and the cytoskeleton and identify potential new therapeutic targets 
for treating cancer and other growth factor–driven diseases.

Growth factor signaling through receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is crucial to many 
aspects of development and morphogenesis 
(Fig. 1) (1). The importance of these signal-
ing networks is underscored by the deregu-
lation of RTKs in almost all types of human 
cancer. As such, decades of research have fo-
cused on elucidating and pharmacologically 
inhibiting the now canonical downstream ki-
nase cascades that are induced by RTK acti-
vation and required for cell proliferation and 
survival (2, 3). In contrast, how growth factor– 
initiated biochemical responses are translated 
into complex cell behaviors, such as cell-cell 
communication, migration and invasion, or 
even the act of cell division, is not well under-
stood (4). As our understanding of the impor-
tance of these behaviors in disease progression 
increases, so does our appreciation of their po-
tential as points of therapeutic intervention.
Recent studies have begun to highlight and 
unravel an interdependent relationship be-
tween RTKs and cellular cytoskeletal networks 
that is fundamental to the regulation of these 
complex cell behaviors and can be hijacked 
by tumor cells to drive tumor invasion and 
proliferation (5–8). For example, tight coor-
dination between the activity of the epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the 
cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton enables the 
localized modulation of cell-cell junctions and 
other actin-based structures to be translated 
into tissue scale changes in cell shape and or-
ganization (1). In turn, cell junctions can reg-
ulate EGFR activity by controlling receptor 
distribution or access to ligand, and the as-
sociated actomyosin network can transmit 
mechanical forces that affect EGFR signaling 
and trafficking at the plasma membrane (9). 
The actin cytoskeletal network is spatially and 

functionally coordinated with that of micro-
tubules, which direct the polarized movement 
of vesicles that deliver, remove, or recycle plas-
ma membrane receptors (10). Even less well 
understood are mechanisms by which signal-
ing from receptors like EGFR can function-
ally influence the microtubule networks that 
control their spatial distribution.

In this issue of Science Signaling, Roth et al. 
(11) and Pike et al. (12) from the Yarden and 
Parsons groups, respectively, used different
proteomic approaches to uncover new insight 
into the complex question of how EGF-induced 
signaling modulates cytoskeletal remodeling 
during cell migration, adhesion, and division. 
Roth et al. used stable isotope labeling by amino 
acids in cell culture (SILAC)–based phos-
phoproteomic analysis to identify previously
unknown proteins involved in growth factor– 
induced migration in mammary epithelial cells
(11). Taking advantage of the fact that EGF,
but not serum, is sufficient to stimulate migra-
tion of nontransformed mammary epithelial
cells, they analyzed the differential patterns
of phosphorylation distal to either stimulus.
They found that the panel of substrates that
was phosphorylated in response to either
stimulus was remarkably similar, but many
were phosphorylated at multiple sites and
with modestly different kinetics. This work
highlights the complexity of growth factor–
mediated control of cell architecture and
suggests that the ability of EGF to induce mi-
gration is the result of a collection of subtle
changes in phosphorylation kinetics, rather
than the modification of a unique set of sub-
strates. One example of these subtle differences 
is ladinin-1 (LAD-1), a largely uncharacterized 
protein that emerged as a candidate in the
screen due to the fact that of seven residues that

are phosphorylated in response to EGF or se-
rum stimulation, one is EGF-specific. LAD-1 is 
also transcriptionally induced by EGF, and the 
phosphorylated form specifically associates 
with actin filaments. The authors identified 
two proteins, filamin A (FLNA) and 14-3-3 sig-
ma (SFN), as binding partners of LAD-1 and 
suggest a model wherein LAD-1 modulates 
actin remodeling via the phosphorylation- 
dependent recruitment of SFN to filamin- 
bundled actin filaments to promote F-actin 
depolymerization and treadmilling (Fig. 1, 
inset #1). The importance of further defining 
this mechanism is underscored by the authors’ 
discovery of an important role for LAD-1 in 
mediating mammary cell migration and pro-
liferation and association of LAD-1 with poor 
prognosis in breast cancer patients.

The importance of the dynamic interrela-
tionship of EGFR and the microtubule cytoskel-
eton in complex cell behaviors is highlighted 
by the studies of Pike et al. (12). After finding 
that the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor 
(CAR), a junction adhesion molecule family 
member, is important for EGF-dependent 
proliferation in lung cancer cells and estab-
lishing that protein kinase C –dependent 
phosphorylation of CAR alters its distribution 
at cell-cell junctions, the authors used mass 
spectrometry to identify the chromokinesin 
KIF22 as a phospho-specific binding partner 
for CAR (Fig. 1, inset #2). In KIF22- depleted cells, 
EGFR is rapidly internalized from the plasma 
membrane, and the activity of its canonical 
effector extracellular signal–regulated kinase 
(ERK) is decreased. Their work suggests that 
this is due to a novel cytoplasmic role for 
KIF22 in stabilizing the peripheral microtubule 
network, which would normally stabilize 
EGFR at the plasma membrane and promote 
sustained downstream signaling through ERK. 
This study identifies a potentially novel inter-
action module that could dynamically regu-
late the spatial distribution of both signaling

networks are markedly reorganized upon EGF 
stimulation to modulate cell division, migra-
tion, and invasion. Two new studies use pro-
teomic methods to identify effectors of these 
important growth factor responses. Roth et al. (11) 
identified LAD-1 as a target of EGF-induced phos-
phorylation that is important for migration and 
proliferation of mammary epithelial cells through 
the modulation of actin dynamics (inset #1). They 
propose a model in which EGFR signaling activates 
the phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of 
SFN to FLNA-bundled actin filaments to promote 
F-actin depolymerization and treadmilling that 
facilitates invasive cell behavior. Pike et al. (12) 
identified the chromokinesin KIF22 as a phospho- 
specific binding partner of the CAR cell adhesion 
receptor and suggest that KIF22 regulates both 
EGFR signaling and CAR distribution by stabiliz-
ing the peripheral microtubule network (inset #2). 
This highlights important coordination between 
cell-cell junctions, microtubule dynamics, and EGFR 
activity.

and adhesion receptors. It is not yet under-
stood how the dynamic reorganization 
of CAR at cell junctions contributes to cell 
pro liferation, but it will be important in 
future studies to understand how actomyosin- 
dependent mechanical forces at the cell 
junctions contribute to changes in CAR 
localization. It is likely that coordinated 
interplay between the actin and microtubule 
cytoskeletal networks contributes to these 
processes.

While these studies begin to chip away at 
the complex issue of understanding how growth 
factor signaling coordinates with the cellular 
cytoskeletal networks to modulate complex 
cell behaviors, it is clear that sophisticated new 
approaches will be necessary to fully unravel 
the complexities of the problem. Future studies 
will need to bring together high-throughput 
proteomic approaches such as those described 
here with novel bioengineering tools designed 
to isolate specific aspects of cell behavior in 
physiologically relevant settings. New high- 
resolution imaging techniques now make it 
possible to monitor local and specific cyto-
skeletal changes that occur in response to 
growth factor stimulation in real time. These 
two studies provide a glimpse of what will
