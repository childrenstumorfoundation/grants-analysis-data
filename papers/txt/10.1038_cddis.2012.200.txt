Salirasib sensitizes hepatocarcinoma cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR5
and survivin-dependent mechanisms

N Charette1, C De Saeger1, Y Horsmans1,2, I Leclercq1 and P Sta¨rkel*,1,2

Ras activation is a frequent event in human hepatocarcinoma that may contribute to resistance towards apoptosis. Salirasib is a
ras and mTOR inhibitor that induces a pro-apoptotic phenotype in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines. In this work, we evaluate
whether salirasib sensitizes those cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Cell viability, cell death and apoptosis were evaluated
in vitro in HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7 cells treated with DMSO, salirasib and YM155 (a survivin inhibitor), alone or in combination
with recombinant TRAIL. Our results show that pretreatment with salirasib sensitized human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, but not
normal human hepatocytes, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Indeed, FACS analysis showed that 25 (Huh7) to 50 (HepG2 and Hep3B)
percent of the cells treated with both drugs were apoptotic. This occurred through activation of the extrinsic and the intrinsic
pathways, as evidenced by a marked increase in caspase 3/7 (ﬁve to ninefold), caspase 8 (four to sevenfold) and caspase 9 (eight
to 12-fold) activities in cells treated with salirasib and TRAIL compared with control. Survivin inhibition had an important role in
this process and was sufﬁcient to sensitize hepatocarcinoma cells to apoptosis. Furthermore, TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCC
cells pretreated with salirasib was dependent on activation of death receptor (DR) 5. In conclusion, salirasib sensitizes
hepatocarcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by a mechanism involving the DR5 receptor and survivin inhibition. These
results in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes provide a rationale for testing the combination of salirasib
and TRAIL agonists in human hepatocarcinoma.

Subject Category: Cancer

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of
cancer related mortality, and its incidence is rising. Only a
minority of the patients can be offered a curative treatment,
and recurrence affects the majority of those patients within a
few years.1 Accordingly, new therapeutic approaches for this
dreadful disease are needed.

Loss of sensitivity to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer.2 In
this occurs through several mechanisms including
HCC,
resistance to apoptosis mediated by death receptors (DR’s).3
Among the DR’s ligands,
tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered as a promis-
ing candidate for cancer treatment, as it is able to selectively
induce apoptosis in transformed cells without affecting normal
cells. This has led to the development and clinical evaluation
of recombinant human TRAIL and of monoclonal agonist
antibodies directed against DR4 and DR5, the two receptors
responsible for TRAIL-induced cell death.4 However, tumors
cells, including HCC cells, may be or become resistant to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This occurs through downregula-
tion of DR’s and adapter molecules responsible for down-
stream caspase activation, or through increased expression
of antiapoptotic factors.5,6

Ras activation has been shown to be an ubiquitous and
early event in human HCC,7 whereas mTOR activation is
present in half of the cases.8 Activation of both ras and mTOR
has been implicated in resistance of HCC cells to apopto-
sis.9,10 Furthermore, a recent study suggests an association
between an activating K-ras mutation and resistance to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human pancreatic and lung
cancer cell lines.11

Salirasib (farnesylthiosalicylic acid, FTS) is an S-farnesyl
cysteine analog that interferes with docking of active GTP-
bound ras at the cell membrane. FTS competes with active
ras for its membrane anchorage sites thereby impairing ras
down-stream signaling leading to inhibition of ras-dependent
cell growth.12 It exhibits antitumoral effects in several cancer
cell lines and has recently been evaluated in a phase 1 study
in patients with solid tumors, showing that
it was well
tolerated.13

Previous work of our team has shown that high dose
salirasib blocks hepatocytes proliferation in vivo in rats after
partial hepatectomy.14 We have also shown that its adminis-
tration in a model of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcino-
genesis in rats prevents liver
tumor development by

Salirasib sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL

apoptosis induction in preneoplastic foci, predominantly
through the DR’s pathway while it redirects the proliferation
balance from transformed hepatocytes to non-transformed
cells.15,16 More recently, we have found that salirasib reduces
the growth of human HCC cell lines both in vitro and in a
xenograft model. The growth inhibitory effect was mainly
linked to an inhibition of cell proliferation. However, salirasib
also induced a proapoptotic drift, with an increased expres-
sion of DR’s and a reduced expression of the apoptosis
inhibitors survivin and cFLIP.17

Hypothesizing that salirasib does not only inhibit cell
proliferation but also prepares cells to undergo apoptosis we
determined whether salirasib would sensitize human HCC cell
lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further attempted to
better understand the molecular mechanism involved in the
observed effect.

Results

Salirasib sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL-induced cell
death
Concomitant administration of TRAIL and salirasib. In a ﬁrst
set of experiments, cells were incubated in culture medium
supplemented with DMSO, 75 mM Salirasib, or 150 mM
Salirasib, with or without TRAIL (0, 10, 50 or 100 ng/ml) for
24 h. Cell viability was assessed by a WST-1 assay
(Figure 1a). TRAIL alone induced a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability in HepG2 cells, while it had no
impact on Hep3B and Huh7 cells viability. Salirasib alone
reduced cell viability in all three cell lines at a dose of 150 mM,
but not at 75 mM. Concomitant
treatment of TRAIL and
salirasib did not result in a signiﬁcant further reduction in cell
viability in the three tested cell lines.

Administration of TRAIL in salirasib pretreated cells. In the
next set of experiments, cells were preincubated with DMSO
or salirasib alone for 24 h and then TRAIL was added or not
for an additional 24 h (Figure 1b). These experiments
conﬁrmed that TRAIL alone induced a dose-dependent
reduction of cell viability in HepG2 cells, whereas it had no
effect on Hep3B and Huh7 cells.

Treatment of cells with salirasib alone for 48 h reduced cell
viability in the three tested cell
lines in a dose-dependent
manner, dropping to 50% for 150 mM compared with untreated
controls (DMSO).

Importantly, in HepG2 cells, addition of TRAIL to cells
pretreated with salirasib for 24 h further reduced cell viability,
and the resulting dose-response curve was steeper than the
curve obtained with TRAIL alone, suggesting a synergistic
effect of the combination of salirasib and TRAIL. Furthermore,
pretreatment with salirasib 150 mM sensitized Hep3B and
HuH7 cells to TRAIL: indeed, addition of TRAIL to salirasib-
conditioned cells further reduced cell viability, and this in a
dose-dependent manner. By contrast, addition of TRAIL to
cells pretreated with 75 mM of salirasib for 24 h did not further
reduce cell viability in any of the tested cell lines.

On the basis of these experiments, we chose the experi-
mental conditions where no or 50 ng/ml of TRAIL were added
to the culture medium after 24 h of preincubation with DMSO

or 150 mM salirasib for all additional experiments, because a
sensitization to TRAIL was observed in all the three cell lines
under these conditions.

As TRAIL is supposed to mainly act through induction of cell
death, we studied LDH released into the culture medium to
assess cell death induction in our experimental setting
(Figure 1c). We have previously reported that salirasib inhibits
cell proliferation in the three tested cell lines.17 Consistently
with the antiproliferation effect of salirasib, treatment with
salirasib alone in the current experiments did not induce a
signiﬁcant LDH release in any of the tested cell
lines. In
accordance with the results of the cell viability assays, TRAIL
alone only induced a relevant LDH release in HepG2. A small
(less than 3%) statistically signiﬁcant difference in LDH
release in Huh7 and Hep3B cells treated with TRAIL
compared with DMSO was also observed. The LDH release
assay is known to have a low signal–to–noise ratio and a high
variability especially in the lower range.18 The measured
values were close to the detection limit of the assay and thus
likely reﬂect background noise. Addition of TRAIL to cells
pretreated with salirasib, induced a marked LDH release in
Hep3B and Huh7 cells reaching 23 and 16% of the maximum
LDH release obtained with a lysis buffer, respectively, and
further increased the TRAIL-induced LDH release in HepG2
cells to 49% of the maximum LDH release. These results
show that TRAIL induces cell death on top of the antiprolifera-
tion effect of salirasib reported in our previous work.17

TRAIL-induced apoptosis in salirasib pretreated cells
involves both the DR and the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathways. We next assessed whether TRAIL induced
apoptosis in salirasib pretreated cells by measuring the
subG0 cell population by FACS (Figure 2a). Salirasib alone
induced a slight but statistically signiﬁcant increase in subG0
events in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, but not in HepG2 cells.
TRAIL alone induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, but not in the
two other cell lines, consistent with Hep3B and Huh7 cells
being resistant
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Addition of
TRAIL to salirasib-pretreated cells induced massive apopto-
sis. Indeed, subG0 events accounted for 53, 50 and 26% of
HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7 cell populations, respectively.

Measurement of caspase 3/7 activity, the principal effector
caspases committing cells to apoptosis, conﬁrmed TRAIL-
induced apoptosis in salirasib-pretreated cells (Figure 2b). In
agreement with FACS data, caspase activation was not seen
in salirasib treated cells, while TRAIL alone increased
caspase activity in HepG2 cells only. Addition of TRAIL to
cells pretreated with salirasib induced a dramatic increase in
caspase-3/7 activity in all three cell lines (9-fold in HepG2,
8.5-fold in Hep3B and 5.5-fold in Huh7).

We next evaluated the implication of

the DR and the
mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis by assessing caspase-8
(Figure 2c) and caspase-9 (Figure 2d) activation, respec-
tively. TRAIL alone induced a modest increase in caspase-8
activity and caspase-9 activity in HepG2 cells, but not in Huh7
and Hep3B cells. Salirasib alone had no effect on the activity
of caspase 8 or 9. By contrast, addition of TRAIL to cells
pretreated with salirasib,
induced a marked increase of
caspase-8 activity (fourfold in HepG2 and Huh7 cells,
sevenfold in Hep3B cells) and an even more pronounced

sensitization

Salirasib-induced
TRAIL-induced
apoptosis is associated with survivin downregulation.
Survivin is a caspase-9 inhibitor, which is downregulated by
salirasib, an event that has been shown to promote apoptosis
in glioblastoma cells.19 As our results show an activation of
caspase-9 in salirasib-pretreated cells exposed to TRAIL, we
studied the expression of survivin both by PCR and western
blotting in cells treated with salirasib alone for 24 or 48 h.

At the mRNA (Figure 3a) level, salirasib reduced survivin
expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. After 48 h
of incubation with 150 mM of salirasib, a drop of mRNA levels
by 60, 70 and 45% was observed in HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7,
respectively. In parallel, exposure to 150 mM salirasib for 48 h
reduced survivin protein levels by 40 to 55% in all three cell
lines (Figure 3b).

Survivin inhibition sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL-
induced apoptosis. The above results suggest that survivin

repression might be at
the mechanism
responsible for salirasib sensitization of cells to TRAIL-
induced apoptosis. To test
this possibility, we assessed
whether inhibition of survivin by YM155, a small molecule
known to suppress survivin protein and mRNA expression
currently in clinical development,20 is sufﬁcient to reproduce
the observed sensitization of HCC cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.

First, we measured cell viability upon increasing doses of
YM155 ranging from 1 to 1000 nM and demonstrated a dose-
dependent reduction with an IC50 of 64 nM (95% CI 51 to
81 nM) in HepG2 cells, 107 nM (88 to 130 nM) in Huh7 cells
and 197 nM (173 to 224 nM) in Hep3B cells (Figure 4a).
Second, we incubated cells with 150 nM of YM155 for 48 h and
observed a marked downregulation of survivin protein
expression in all the three cell lines (Figures 4b and 4c) in
accordance with the predicted mechanism of action of the
compound.

Similar to our experiments performed with salirasib, we then
evaluated apoptosis in cells exposed to DMSO or 150 nM of
YM155 for 48 h with or without TRAIL for the last 24 h.

revealed that YM155 alone elicited a 2.5-fold increase in
apoptosis in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, but not in HepG2 cells.
Addition of TRAIL to YM155 pretreated cells, caused a further
increase of apoptosis exceeding apoptosis induced by TRAIL
alone in HepG2 cells, or apoptosis induced by YM155 alone in
Huh7 and Hep3B. Indeed, subG0 events accounted for 39, 47
and 22% of HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively.
These results show that elective inhibition of survivin is
sufﬁcient
to reproduce the TRAIL-sensitization effect
observed with salirasib suggesting that downregulation
of survivin signiﬁcantly contributes to salirasib-induced
sensitization to TRAIL.

TRAIL-induced apoptosis in salirasib pretreated cells is
mediated by DR5. TRAIL may elicit apoptosis upon binding
to either DR4 and/or 5. Several agonist antibodies currently
target either DR4 or DR5.4 This
in clinical development
prompted us to study the respective role of these receptors in
apoptosis induced by the combination of salirasib and TRAIL.
We ﬁrst examined whether salirasib pretreatment for 24 h
upregulated DR4 and DR5 transcript levels in our cell lines.
Salirasib induced DR4 mRNA expression in HepG2 and
Hep3B but not
in Huh7 cells whereas induction of DR5

mRNA expression was observed in all the three cell
lines
(Figure 5a). Next, we assessed the impact of antagonistic
antibodies directed against DR4 or DR5 (Figure 5b) on the
viability of cells pretreated with salirasib for 24 h and followed
by administration of TRAIL. In all three tested cell lines, DR4
inhibition only partially reversed the reduction in cell viability
induced by the combination of salirasib and TRAIL. By
contrast, DR5 inhibition almost completely abrogated the
effect of TRAIL in HepG2, and totally reversed it in Huh7 and
Hep3B.
further
enhance the effect observed with inhibition of DR5 alone in
Huh7 and Hep3B, while it induced a slight but statistically
signiﬁcant additional
In
parallel with the upregulation of DR5 transcript levels, these
data strongly suggest that sensitization to TRAIL induced
cell death in salirasib pretreated cells principally depends
upon DR5.

Inhibition of both DR4 and DR5 did not

increase in HepG2 cell viability.

To further conﬁrm the involvement of DR5 in this process,

pretreated Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Altogether, these data
clearly show that sensitization to TRAIL induced cell death
in salirasib pretreated cells principally involves activation
of DR5.

cell viability nor any measurable LDH release was observed
in cells treated with salirasib and TRAIL, either alone or in
combination, compared with controls (DMSO) (Figure 6).
These results conﬁrm that combination of salirasib and
TRAIL is not toxic for primary human hepatocytes.

Concomitant treatment with salirasib and TRAIL is not
toxic for human hepatocytes. It is widely accepted that
TRAIL is not toxic for normal cells.4 However, this may not be
the case when TRAIL is used in combination with other
treatments because the same molecular mechanisms may
be involved in TRAIL-resistance of both normal and tumor
cells, resulting in sensitization of otherwise resistant normal
cells.6 In order to address this issue, primary normal human
hepatocytes were pretreated with DMSO or 150 mM salirasib
for 24 h before addition of 50 or 100 ng/ml of human
recombinant TRAIL. Cell viability and cell death (LDH
release) were then determined. No signiﬁcant difference in

Discussion

The ability of TRAIL to selectively trigger apoptosis in cancer
cells has led to the clinical development of recombinant TRAIL
and TRAIL-receptor agonists as anticancer therapy. To date,
stable disease is the best response obtained in the majority of
patients treated with such agents, and the best clinical use of
this new therapeutic class seems to be in combination with
conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents to overcome
resistance.4

Our results showed for the ﬁrst time that pretreatment with
salirasib sensitizes human HCC cell lines to TRAIL-induced

apoptosis. Both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of
apoptosis are involved in this process, as evidenced by a
strong induction of caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity. This
ﬁnding suggests that HCC cells are type 2 cells capable of
amplifying apoptotic signaling initiated by DR’s through the
recruitment of the mitochondrial pathway, as observed in
other cell types.4 Moreover, TRAIL-induced reduction in cell
viability was strongly attenuated when cells were incubated
with an antagonist antibody against DR5, but not DR4.
Consistently, an agonist antibody speciﬁc for DR5 also
reduced cell viability in cells pretreated with salirasib. These
data are in line with the ﬁnding of a greater contribution of DR5
than DR4 to apoptosis induction in cancer cells harboring both
receptors.21 As both DR4 and DR5 agonists are under clinical
development22,23 our results provide a rationale for the use of
the latter in the setting of HCC in clinical practice.

Liver toxicity is an important concern regarding the use of
TRAIL and DR agonists in humans.5 It is therefore crucial
to ensure that a treatment used to sensitize tumor cells to

TRAIL-induced apoptosis does not induce toxicity in normal
hepatocytes. As mice only harbors one apoptosis-inducing
TRAIL receptor, equally homologous to both human apopto-
sis-inducing TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5,24 classical
murine models might not be suited to evaluate the toxicity of
TRAIL-based treatments. Therefore, we evaluated the effect
of TRAIL or salirasib alone or in combination in vitro in primary
human hepatocytes. Importantly, we observed no reduction in
hepatocytes viability and no signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in any of
the treatment groups compared with untreated controls,
suggesting that normal hepatocytes are not affected by either
or both drugs. This point is relevant for translation to clinical
settings.

We show here that salirasib sensitized HCC cells to TRAIL-
induced apoptosis only when cells were pretreated with
salirasib before the exposure to TRAIL but not when the two
drugs were applied simultaneously for 24 h from the begin-
ning. Thus, cells need to be primed by salirasib to undergo
apoptosis. As shown in our previous work, multiple

Figure 6 Treatment with salirasib and TRAIL is not
toxic for human
hepatocytes. Primary human hepatocytes seeded in collagen-coated 96-wells
plates were incubated in a culture medium containing DMSO or 150 mM salirasib for
24 h. The culture medium was then replaced by a medium containing the same
concentration of salirasib with or without 100 ng/ml TRAIL (n¼ 8 per group) for 24 h.
Cell viability was then assessed using a WST-1 assay (a) and cell death was
assessed by a LDH release assay (b). Data are presented as relative change
compared with untreated controls (mean±S.E.M.)

translational events including downregulation of antiapoptotic
proteins and upregulation of proapoptotic receptors require
roughly 24 h to occur,17 which likely deﬁnes a transition period
during which the cells remain insensitive to TRAIL. This
suggests that the underlying molecular mechanism by which
salirasib exerts its preparatory effect do not act instantly and
do not solely depend on the activation status of ras-dependent
signaling pathways. One possible mechanism that could
explain this observation might be downregulation of survivin.
Survivin is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein
(IAP) family of proteins, which is able to inhibit caspase-9. It
has been found to be frequently overexpressed in most types
of cancer, including HCC, whereas it is undetectable in most
normal adult tissues.25 In human HCC, survivin expression
correlates with a reduced overall survival.26 Previous work of

Cell Death and Disease

our team showed that salirasib reduces survivin mRNA
expression in the three tested HCC cell lines.17 In the current
study, protein expression of survivin markedly decreased
after 48 h of treatment with 150 mM of salirasib, coinciding with
the sensitization effect to TRAIL. It is therefore tempting to
speculate that salirasib-induced inhibition of survivin has an
important role in this process. This concept is also supported
by data in the literature showing that downregulation of
survivin by an antisense compound induced apoptosis in
HepG2 cells.27 Furthermore, salirasib also reduced survivin
expression in glioblastoma cell
lines, promoting caspase-
dependent cell death.19 We have previously shown that
salirasib abrogates ras activation in our HCC cell lines that
persists even after EGF stimulation known to strongly induce
ras activity.17 Several
lines of evidence suggest that Ras
could directly modulate survivin expression in different cancer
cell lines based on approaches such as the use of dominant-
negative Ras as well as Ras inhibitors like salirasib. Thus
downregulation of survivin mRNA and protein levels in our
cells might at least in part be imputable to ras inhibition.19,28–32
IAPs such as
survivin are major determinants of TRAIL-induced apoptosis,6
and it
inhibition of survivin would
sensitize them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by suppressing
a brake on the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. It is likely
that a similar effect occurs in our three HCC cell lines, as
caspase-9 activation (mitochondrial pathway) upon TRAIL
exposure in cells pretreated with salirasib is stronger than
caspase-8 activation (DR pathway) under the same condi-
tions. Moreover, sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
salirasib parallels a reduction of survivin expression.
In
addition, we showed that selective inhibition of survivin by
YM-155 sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis to a
similar extent than salirasib treatment. This is consistent with
the ﬁnding by others that survivin inhibition by a siRNA
sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.33 Alto-
gether, these data indicate that survivin also has an important
role in the sensitization process to TRAIL-induced cell death in
our HCC cell lines.

In mitochondria-dependent

type 2 cells,

is thus plausible that

Conclusion

Our results show for the ﬁrst time that salirasib sensitizes
human HCC cell
lines to TRAIL-induced cell death by
activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways of
apoptosis, while this combination is not toxic for primary
human hepatocytes. Apoptosis induction in cells treated with
this combination is mediated by the DR5, but not by the DR4
receptor. Furthermore, we show that survivin inhibition by
salirasib has an important role in this sensitization process. As
salirasib and TRAIL-agonists are currently under clinical
lines and
development, these results in human HCC cell
primary hepatocytes provide a rationale for
testing the
combination of salirasib and TRAIL agonists in human HCC.

Materials and methods
Compounds. Salirasib was kindly provided by Concordia Pharmaceuticals
(Fort Lauderdale, Fl, USA). Unless stated otherwise, all cell culture reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen (Brussels, Belgium). Human recombinant TRAIL was
obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA), antagonist anti-DR4 and anti-DR5

antibodies from Diaclone (Besanc¸on, France) and agonist anti-DR5 antibody from
R&D (Abingdon, UK). YM155 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston,
TX, USA).

Cell culture
Culture conditions. HepG2, Huh7 and Hep3B were obtained from the European
Collection of Cell Culture (Salisbury, UK) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1%
streptomycin and penicillin, 1% non essential amino-acid, in 5% CO2 at 37 1C.
Cells were allowed to adhere overnight. Thereafter,
they were incubated in
medium supplemented with 0.1% dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO, vehicle) or salirasib,
with or without TRAIL. Culture medium was renewed once a day. Cells were
seeded in 6-well plates for cell cycle analysis or in 96-well plates for WST-1, LDH,
and caspase assays, at a density of 5 105 and 5 103 cells per well,
respectively. For protein and RNA preparation, cells were plated at a density of
1.5 106 per 10 cm petri dish.

Primary human hepatocytes were provided by Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) plated
as conﬂuent monolayers in a 96-wells collagen-coated plate, and cultured in human
blood medium supplemented with hepatocyte basal medium Singlequots (Lonza)
and 10% FBS.

Experimental design. For cell viability studies,
the cells were incubated with
DMSO or salirasib (75 or 150 mM) for up to 48 h. TRAIL (25, 50 or 100 ng/ml) was
added either immediately to the cell culture medium or after 24 h preincubation
with salirasib. Cell viability was also studied in cells cultured with various
concentration of YM155, a survivin inhibitor, in order to determine its IC50 value,
deﬁned as the value at which 50% of the cell growth is inhibited compared with the
regression analysis using
DMSO control.
GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, USA).

IC50 was calculated by nonlinear

Analyses of apoptosis, LDH release and caspases activity were performed in
cells exposed to DMSO or 150 mM salirasib during 48 h, and 50 ng/ml of TRAIL were
added after 24 h preincubation with salirasib. Apoptosis was also analyzed in cells
exposed to 150 nM of YM155 instead of salirasib. Protein and RNA extraction was
performed in cells exposed to DMSO, 150 mM salirasib or 150 nM of YM155, during
24 or 48 h. All experiments were repeated at least twice on separate days.

Determination of cell viability and LDH release. Cell viability was
determined using a colorimetric WST-1 assay (Roche, Vilvoorde, Belgium)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. LDH release was assessed using the
Cytotoxicity Detection KitPlus
following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

(Roche, Vilvoorde, Belgium)

Determination of apoptosis. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and
washed with PBS. They were ﬁxed in ice-cold ethanol, washed, resuspended in
PBS and treated with RNase A. Finally, cells were stained with propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium). The stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) and DNA
content was quantiﬁed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences,
Erembodegem, Belgium). Apoptosis was analyzed by assessing sub-G0 events
in the euploid cell fraction.
Caspases activity was assessed using the Caspase-Glo-3/7,   8, and   9 assays

(Promega, Leiden, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blotting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% Triton
X-100, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium ﬂuoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 2 mg/ml
leupeptin and aprotinin). Equal amounts of
protein, determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA), were
separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on to
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes according to standard techniques. Membranes
were incubated overnight with an antisurvivin antibody (Cell Signalling, Danvers, MA,
USA) and revealed with the ‘Western Lightning Chemiluminescent Reagent Plus’
(Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) detection system. Immunoreactive proteins were
quantiﬁed by densitometry analysis using the Gel DocXR System 170–8170 device
and software (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium). b-actin was used as loading control.

Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Cells were harvested in
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Brussels, Belgium) for RNA extraction. RNA was
