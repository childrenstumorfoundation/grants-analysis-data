Tumors with mutant BRAF are dependent on the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway for
their growth1-3. We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signaling in
cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signaling in cells with wild-type BRAF.
Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We employed chemical
genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible
for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signaling requires
direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is
dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homo-(CRAF/CRAF) or
heterodimers (CRAF/BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the
drug-free protomer. In BRAFV600E tumors, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is
minimal and ERK signaling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results
imply that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumors in which BRAF is mutated.
Furthermore, since they do not inhibit ERK signaling in other cells, the model predicts that
they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumor activity than MEK
inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have
been borne out strikingly in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX40324-5. Finally,
the model suggests that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF
expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumors. In
agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signaling in cells that
coexpress BRAFV600E and mutant RAS.

Six distinct ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors induced ERK activation in cells with wild-type
BRAF, but inhibited signaling in mutant BRAFV600E cells (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Fig.
2a, b, Data Not Shown (DNS), structures of compounds shown in Supplementary Fig. 3,
except that of PLX4032, which is unavailable). PLX47206, and its analog in clinical trial
PLX4032, were studied in more detail. PLX4032 inhibited ARAF, BRAF and CRAF
immunoprecipitated from 293H cells (Supplementary Fig. 4) and purified catalytic domains
of BRAFV600E, wild-type BRAF and CRAF (IC50s: 35, 110 and 48nM) (Supplementary
Table 1). PLX4032 was assayed against 62 additional kinases that span the kinome, and had
IC50s of 1μM-10μM against eight of these and greater than 10μM against the rest (G.B.,

unpublished data). Induction of ERK signaling by PLX4720 was rapid (Fig. 1c), reversible
(Fig. 1d), and associated with increased phosphorylation of the ERK substrate RSK (Fig 1b).
MEK and ERK phosphorylation were induced at intermediate concentrations of RAF
inhibitor, and inhibited at much higher doses (Fig. 1a).

Physiologic induction of ERK signaling depends on upstream activation of RAS by
receptor-induced signaling7-8. PLX4032 induced ERK signaling in SKBR3 breast cancer
cells, in which RAS activation is HER2-dependent9. The HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib
abolished basal and PLX4032-induced ERK signaling in these cells (Supplementary Fig.
5a). In 293H cells, induction of MEK and ERK phosphorylation by either PLX4032 or
PLX4720 was barely detectable (PLX will refer to data obtained with both compounds).
HA-tagged wild-type RAS overexpression resulted in enhanced MEK/ERK activation by
RAF inhibitor, which was more pronounced when mutant RAS was overexpressed (Fig. 2a
and Supplementary Fig. 5b). The results suggest that RAS activity is required for MEK/
ERK activation by RAF inhibitors. In contrast, in 293H cells expressing FLAG-tagged
BRAFV600E, ERK signaling was inhibited by PLX4032 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). These
results suggest that RAF inhibitors will inhibit the growth of tumors with mutant BRAF, but
not those with wild-type BRAF, including those with RAS mutation. This is indeed the case:
MEK-dependent tumors with RAS mutation are unaffected by PLX4032 (unpublished data).
BRAF and CRAF kinases form homo- and heterodimers upon RAS activation10-12. PLX
induced pronounced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in wild-type MEFs and BRAF (−/
−) MEFs. The response was diminished markedly in CRAF (−/−) MEFs (Fig. 2b,
Supplementary Fig. 6a). Coexpression of CRAF and active RAS in CRAF (−/−) MEFs
reconstituted the wild-type phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). We conclude that BRAF
is dispensable for MEK/ERK activation by PLX, and that CRAF expression is required for
significant induction. We therefore investigated the mechanism of CRAF-dependent
induction of ERK signaling in response to the drug.

Autoinhibition of RAF by its N-terminal domain13 is relieved upon binding to activated
RAS7. We asked whether overexpression of an N-truncated form of CRAF would bypass
the requirement for RAS activity. In 293H cells expressing the catalytic domain of CRAF
(catC), PLX caused dramatic induction of MEK and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Fig. 7a). We focused mechanistic investigations on catC, in which PLX-
induced MEK/ERK activation is RAS-independent. To test whether direct binding of PLX
to CRAF is required for induction of signaling, we generated a catC carrying a mutation at
the gatekeeper position (T421) in the kinase domain (mutations used and their properties are
in Supplementary Fig. 1a). Structural studies6 predict that the T421M mutation should
prevent drug binding and catCT421M was indeed resistant to inhibition by PLX in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). ERK signaling was not induced by PLX in cells expressing
catCT421M (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Thus, activation of MEK/ERK by PLX
depends on its direct binding to the RAF kinase active site. Sorafenib inhibited catCT421M in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8c) and induced ERK signaling in cells expressing catCT421M
(Fig. 2c), demonstrating that this mutant is capable of inhibitor-induced MEK/ERK
activation. Thus, direct binding of an ATP-competitive inhibitor to CRAF is required for
induction of ERK signaling.

Recent work shows that binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors to AKT and PKC inhibits
their activity, but induces the active, phosphorylated state of these kinases14-15. Washed
catC immunoprecipitated from PLX-treated cells was more active than that isolated from
untreated cells (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9a). The same was true for endogenous BRAF
and CRAF immunoprecipitated from treated Calu-6 cells (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 9b).
Phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S621 has been correlated with its activation7. PLX

caused increased phosphorylation of both sites on wild-type and kinase-dead CRAF in 293H
cells. In contrast, it did not affect the phosphorylation of the PLX-resistant CRAFT421M
mutant. (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 9c). All RAF inhibitors tested induced phosphorylation
at p338 of endogenous CRAF (Fig. 3d). The data suggest that binding of PLX to CRAF
induces activation of the enzyme and, subsequently, ERK signaling. The result seems
paradoxical: binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors to the catalytic domain of CRAF
activate its function.
RAF isoforms form dimers in cells10-12,16. Since binding of both the drug and ATP to the
catalytic domain would be required for activation and cannot occur simultaneously on the
same molecule, we hypothesized that RAF inhibitors activate CRAF dimers in trans.
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). To test this model, we generated mutant catCS428C that binds to
quinazoylacrylamide-based inhibitors17, whereas catC does not. Two inhibitors JAB1317
and JAB34 (PD-168393)18 both inhibited catCS428C, but up to 30μM had no effect in vitro
on catC (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). JAB13 and JAB34 selectively affected ERK signaling
in cells expressing catCS428C, and were inactive in those expressing catC (Supplementary
Fig. 11). Like the other inhibitors (Fig. 1a), lower doses (40nM - 1μM) induced ERK
signaling (Supplementary Fig. 11), whereas higher doses (10μM) inhibited (Fig. 4a). The
specificity of this system allows us to test the dimer transactivation model. We coexpressed
a V5-tagged, JAB-sensitive, kinase-dead catC, V5-catCS428C/D486N and FLAG-catC in
293H cells. V5-catCS428C/D486N is deficient in catalytic activity; it can bind to the inhibitor
(JAB34) but cannot phosphorylate MEK, while FLAG-catC is catalytically active, but
cannot bind JAB34. Treatment of cells expressing both constructs with a concentration of
JAB34 that inhibited ERK signaling in cells expressing catCS428C alone (10μM JAB34, Fig.
4a) resulted in marked induction of ERK signaling (Fig. 4b, lanes 5-6). Thus, binding of
JAB34 to kinase-dead, V5-catCS428C/D486N transactivated the catalytically competent
FLAG-catC. When the catalytically active drug-binding mutant V5-catCS428C is
coexpressed with catalytically inactive catC (FLAG-catCD486N), 10μM JAB34 inhibited,
rather than activated ERK signaling. (Fig. 4b, lanes 9-10). When both constructs were
insensitive to JAB, JAB34 had no effect on ERK signaling (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-2). When both
constructs were catalytically active, we observed moderate MEK/ERK activation, likely
resulting from inhibition of V5-catCS428C and transactivation of FLAG-catC (Fig. 4b, lanes
3-4).

Transactivation from CRAF to BRAF can occur as well. JAB34 activated ERK signaling in
cells coexpressing FLAG-BRAF with V5-catCS428C/D486N (Fig. 4c). Finally, JAB34
induced ERK activation in cells coexpressing full-length V5-CRAFS428C/D486N and wild-
type FLAG-CRAF, confirming that our model is valid in the context of full-length CRAF
(Supplementary Fig. 12).

Thus, activation of RAF by ATP-competitive inhibitors can be explained by transactivation:
binding of drug to one RAF in the dimer activates the other. This is consistent with the
enhancement of induction by active RAS, which promotes homo- and hetero-dimerization of
BRAF and CRAF10,12. Our model suggests that transactivation will be dependent on
formation of RAF dimers. A side-to-side dimer of the kinase domain is observed in crystal
structures of BRAF11 and the residues at the dimer interface are conserved in all RAF
isoforms. Based on the BRAF crystal structures, we identified a conserved Arg (R509) at the
center of the dimer interface. Structural analysis predicts that mutation of R509 will
diminish contacts between the two interacting proteins and reduce dimer formation, as also
recently reported19. In that study, mutation of BRAF at R509 to Histidine resulted in
dramatic loss of activity. The corresponding mutation in catC (R401H) results in severe loss
of both expression and activity (DNS). We therefore mutated R401 to Alanine in V5-
catCS428C and FLAG-catC. This mutation diminished dimerization (Supplementary Fig. 13),

but retained expression and activity. In cells coexpressing these mutants, JAB34 failed to
induce ERK signaling (Fig. 4b, lanes 7-8). Thus, a mutation that affects dimerization
prevents transactivation.

The transactivation model explains the observation that inhibitors of RAF activate ERK
signaling at low concentrations, but inhibit at higher concentrations in BRAFwild-type cells.
Binding of an ATP-competitive inhibitor to one protomer within a RAF dimer results in
both abolition of the catalytic activity of the inhibitor-bound RAF and transactivation of the
other. Transactivation of RAF homo- and heterodimers is therefore responsible for induction
of MEK/ERK phosphorylation by RAF inhibitors in cells with wild-type BRAF. Our model
explains the paradoxical phenomenon of ERK activation by RAF inhibitors, previously
reported by others20-22. Other kinases that exist in dimeric or multimeric complexes may
behave in a similar manner. Recently, another model to explain these phenomena has been
proposed23. They report that only selective BRAF inhibitors activate CRAF and ERK
signaling, whereas pan-RAF inhibitors do not. Our data that all RAF inhibitors activate ERK
signaling at low concentrations, that the phenomenon occurs in BRAF-null cells and that
binding to CRAF activates CRAF and BRAF-dependent ERK signaling render that model
unlikely.

Nevertheless, the clinical utility of these inhibitors depends on their inhibition of ERK
signaling in tumor cells with BRAFV600E. Since transactivation of wild-type RAF requires
dimerization and depends on RAS activity, we hypothesized that the levels of RAS activity
in BRAFV600E mutant tumors may not be sufficient to support transactivation. If so,
activation of RAS in BRAFV600E cells should prevent inhibition of ERK signaling by RAF
inhibitors. In 293H cells overexpressing BRAFV600E and in HT29 tumor cells with
endogenous BRAFV600E, ERK signaling was inhibited by either PLX or a MEK inhibitor. In
contrast, when mutant RAS was coexpressed with BRAFV600E in either cell, ERK signaling
became resistant to PLX, but remained sensitive to the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 4d,
Supplementary Fig. 14a, b).

The data are consistent with the idea that RAF inhibitors suppress ERK signaling in
BRAFV600E tumors because the level of RAS activation in these cells is insufficient to
support transactivation of wild-type RAF and inhibition of BRAFV600E activity becomes the
dominant effect of the drug. The findings suggest that increases in RAS activation or RAF
dimerization may be sufficient to cause drug resistance.

The clinical implications of these findings are profound. BRAFV600E tumors and some with
RAS mutation are dependent on ERK signaling. However, in clinic, a MEK inhibitor had
only a 12% response rate in melanomas with BRAF mutation24. MEK inhibitors block ERK
signaling in all tumor and normal cells and the dose of the drug that can be administered is
limited by toxicity. RAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors might have been expected to have
similar biologic effects. Our findings show otherwise. RAF inhibitors will be useful for the
treatment of tumors driven by BRAFV600E, but could have deleterious effects in some
contexts due to ERK activation. However, the absence of ERK inhibition in normal cells
may allow administration of high doses of RAF inhibitors and thus more complete inhibition
of ERK signaling in BRAFV600E tumors, than is possible with MEK inhibitors.

The recent phase I clinical trial of PLX4032 in metastatic melanoma strikingly confirmed
these predictions4-5. High serum levels of drug were achieved with modest toxicity and
resulted in profound inhibition of ERK signaling in tumors. Tumor regression was observed
in more than 90% of patients with BRAFV600E mutation, with 64% achieving a partial
response by RECIST criteria. We believe that the remarkable activity of this drug, compared

to that of MEK inhibitors, is due to its ability to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors more
completely because of the absence of ERK inhibition in normal tissue.

Resistance to PLX4032 does develop, with a median time to disease progression of 8-9
months5. Potential mechanisms include gatekeeper mutations in BRAF and activating
mutations in parallel signaling pathways. Our results suggest the possibility of novel
mechanisms as well. Lesions that activate RAS or, as recently reported, overexpression of
wild type RAF isoforms25 could result in inability of RAF inhibitors to suppress ERK
signaling in the tumor and thus lead to resistance.

Figure 1. RAF inhibitors rapidly activate MEK/ERK in cells with wild-type BRAF
a, Calu-6 cells (BRAFwild-type/K-RASQ61K) were treated with increasing doses of the
indicated RAF inhibitors and the effects on ERK signaling were determined by
immunoblotting for pMEK and pERK. b, Cells with wild-type BRAF (Calu-6) or mutant
BRAF (Malme-3M) were treated with vehicle or PLX4720 (1μM/1 hour). Phosphorylation
and expression of the indicated proteins were assayed by immunoblotting. c, Calu-6 cells
treated with 1μM PLX4720 for the indicated time points. d, Calu-6 cells were treated with
1μM PLX4720 for 60 minutes, then medium was replaced with medium containing 1μM
PLX4720 (lanes 3-5) or vehicle (lanes 8-10) for the indicated time points.

Figure 2. MEK/ERK activation requires binding of drug to the catalytic domain of RAF
a, 293H cells transfected with EGFP (control), HA-tagged RASG12V, the catalytic domain of
CRAF (V5-tagged catC) and catC carrying a mutation at the gatekeeper residue (V5-tagged
catCT421M), treated with vehicle or PLX4720 (1μM/1 hour). Lysates were subjected to
immunoblot analysis for pMEK and pERK. b, Wild-type (+/+), BRAF knock-out (BRAF −/
−) or CRAF knock-out (CRAF −/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with
the indicated concentrations of PLX4720 for 1 hour. c, Sorafenib inhibits the gatekeeper
mutant catCT421M protein in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8c) and activates MEK/ERK in cells
expressing it. 293H cells overexpressing catCT421M were treated with the indicated
concentrations of sorafenib for 1 hour. Lysates were subjected to analysis for pMEK and
pERK.

Figure 3. RAF inhibitor induces the active, phosphorylated state of wild-type and kinase-dead
RAF
a, 293H cells over-expressing catC were treated with the indicated amounts of PLX4720 for
1 hour. Cells were lysed, catC was immunoprecipitated, washed extensively and subjected to
kinase assay. Kinase activity was determined by immunoblotting for pMEK. b, Calu-6 cells
were treated with PLX4720 (1μM/1 hour). Endogenous BRAF and CRAF were
immunoprecipitated, washed and assayed for kinase activity. c, Treatment with RAF
inhibitor results in elevated phosphorylation at activating phosphorylation sites on RAF. V5-
tagged wild-type CRAF or kinase-dead CRAFD486N were overexpressed in 293H cells.
After 24 hours cells were treated with vehicle or PLX4720 (5μM/1hour) and lysates were
immunoblotted for p338CRAF and p621CRAF. The gatekeeper mutant CRAFT421M was
used as negative control. d. Samples as in Fig. 1a, immunoblotted for pS338CRAF. Note
that phosphorylation at S338 steadily increased, even when concentrations were reached that
inhibited MEK/ERK.

Figure 4. MEK/ERK induction occurs via transactivation of RAF dimers
a, Similarly to RAF inhibitors, JAB34 inhibits MEK/ERK at higher concentrations. 293H
cells expressing V5-tagged catC or catCS428C were treated with either vehicle or 10μM
JAB34 for 1 hour. b, Coexpression of drug-sensitive V5-tagged catC with drug-resistant
FLAG-catC reveals that activation in the homodimer occurs in trans. 293H cells expressing
the indicated mutants V5-tagged catC and FLAG-tagged catC were treated with a dose of
JAB34 (10μM/1 hour) that inhibits catCS428C when expressed alone. c, Activation in the
context of the heterodimer BRAF/CRAF occurs in trans. 293H cells co-expressing FLAG-
tagged wild-type BRAF and V5- tagged kinase-dead catC (catCD486N) (lanes 3,4) or JAB34-
sensitive/kinase-dead catC (catCS428C/D486N) (lanes 5,6) treated with vehicle or 10μM
JAB34 for 1 hour. d, HT-29 cells (colorectal – BRAFV600E) were transfected with EGFP or
HA-tagged N-RASG12V and treated with PLX4720 (1μM/1hour). Lysates were blotted for
pMEK and pERK.
