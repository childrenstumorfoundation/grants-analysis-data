Abstract

Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a complex genetic disorder
with a high predisposition of numerous skeletal dysplasias including short stature, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, and fracture
non-union (pseudoarthrosis). We have developed murine models that phenocopy many of the skeletal dysplasias observed
in NF1 patients, including reduced bone mass and fracture non-union. We also show that the development of these skeletal
manifestations requires an Nf1 haploinsufficient background in addition to nullizygous loss of Nf1 in mesenchymal stem/
progenitor cells (MSCs) and/or their progenies. This is replicated in two animal models of NF1, PeriCre+;Nf1flox/2 and
Col2.3Cre+;Nf1flox/2mice. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate a critical role of the Nf1+/2 marrow microenvironment
in the impaired fracture healing in both models and adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells improves fracture healing in
these mice. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a non-cell autonomous mechanism in non-malignant NF1
manifestations. Collectively, these data provide evidence of a combinatory effect between nullizygous loss of Nf1 in
osteoblast progenitors and haploinsufficiency in hematopoietic cells in the development of non-malignant NF1
manifestations.

Introduction

Bone integrity is maintained by the balance between osteoclasts
originated from hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal-
derived osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells specialized
in bone resorption, whereas osteoblasts are bone forming cells
derived from the mesenchymal stem cells. The development of the
osteoblast and osteoclast lineages is tightly coupled [1]. Imbalances
in coupling of
to defective skeletal
development [2] as well as abnormal hematopoiesis [3,4].

leads

Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibro-
matosis type 1 (NF1), a common chronic debilitating disorder that
affects 1 in 3,000 individuals [5,6,7,8,9]. Neurofibromin,
the
protein encoded by NF1, functions at least in part as a GTPase
activating protein (GAP) for Ras. Loss of heterozygosity of the
tumorigenic cell is required for genesis of tumors in individuals
with NF1 [10,11]. However, recent studies have also identified a
key role of the microenvironment in tumor progression in both
plexiform neurofibromas [12] and optic gliomas [13,14] in NF1.
Despite advances in understanding the cell-cell
interactions in

cancers affecting NF1 patients, little information of the molecular
and cellular signaling of the microenvironment of the prevalent
nonmalignant manifestations of NF1 exists, particularly those
impacting the skeletal system that are prevalent in ,50% of NF1
patients [6,7,8,9,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Clinical studies have found
that individuals with NF1 are at significant risk for generalized loss
of bone mass (osteopenia and osteoporosis) [21,22,23,24,25,26] as
well as focal skeletal abnormalities [25,27,28,29]. One focal
skeletal abnormality, non-union of spontaneous fractures, also
called pseudoarthrosis, is particularly debilitating and frequently
affects the distal tibia. Despite a range of orthopedic procedures
attempting to facilitate fracture healing,
the typical clinical
outcome is non-union of the fracture and ultimately amputation
of the affected limbs.

Skeletal development and remodeling depends on the balance
of interactions between osteoblasts-mesenchymal stem cell derived
cells, and osteoclasts-specialized macrophages derived from
hematopoietic stem cells that govern skeletal remodeling and
bone resorption [30]. We have previously shown that NF1 patients
and Nf1 haploinsufficient mice have elevated osteoclast activity

[31]. However, the increase in lytic activity of osteoclasts alone is
not sufficient
the osseous manifestations
observed in the NF1 patients. Kolanczyk and colleagues observed
bowing of the tibia and diminished growth in Nf1flox/flox mice that
express Prx1Cre, which is expressed in undifferentiated mesen-
chymal cells in the limb bud. While those studies were informative
concerning limb manifestations of the disease, the axial skeletal
(e.g. kyphosis) are not modeled well due to a lack of expression of
PrxCre in the vertebrae [32]. Elefteriou and colleagues utilized a
genetic approach to delete Nf1 in the osteoblast
lineage by
intercrossing Nf1flox/flox mice with a1(I) Collagen Cre transgenic
mice and found that Nf1 inactivation in osteoblasts affects
osteoclast differentiation in addition to bone formation [33,34].

In the present study, we utilized two novel murine models and
established that
the hematopoietic microenvironment plays a
critical role in fracture healing in the NF1 murine models. Our
study provides
strong evidence of a non-cell autonomous
mechanism for the skeletal manifestations of NF1 and demon-
strates that the hematopoietic microenvironment is instrumental
for bone loss and impaired fracture healing process.

Endogenous full-length Periostin is expressed in primitive MSCs
and epithelial cells [35,36]. To confirm 3.9 kb Periostin fragment
promoter mediated Cre expression in adult MSCs and skeletal
tissues, PeriCre
mice were intercrossed with transgenic reporter
mice that have LacZ sequence knocked into the Rosa26 locus. The
skeletal tissues of the intercrossed progeny were then subjected to
b-gal staining. LacZ expression was abundant in the peripheral
nervous
system as expected [37] but was also detected in
osteoblasts within the cartilaginous ribs as they begin the process
of ossification, the long bone, and vertebrae cartilage of adult
;Rosa26flox/flox mice (data not shown). However, LacZ
PeriCre
staining was not observed in PeriCre2;Rosa26flox/flox littermates
(Figure S1A, c, d). The expression of LacZ in bone tissue was
confirmed following LacZ staining and hematoxylin/eosin (H&E)
counterstaining (Figure S1A).
Interestingly, LacZ expression
within MSCs and skeletal tissues was detected only in mice 4
weeks of age or older, as PeriCre activity is initially restricted to the
in utero heart valves, fetal and neonatal cardiac fibroblasts [38], and
peripheral nervous system (Snider & Conway, unpublished data).
like the endogenous Periostin protein, Peri-Cre
Significantly,
reporter expression is robustly localized to both the postnatal
and adult outer periosteum, which gives rise to the bone collar
covering all skeletal elements,
including cancellous bone, and
within the inner endosteal osteoblasts that secrete the vascularized
bone-specific matrix [39]. LacZ expression was also examined in
adult primary calvarial osteoblasts and MSCs in vitro following
culture in specialized medium that selectively promotes the growth
of these lineages. LacZ was strongly expressed in cultured adult
calvarial osteoblasts and ,15% of the cultured MSCs were LacZ
positive (Figure S1B, a, b).

Discussion

skeletal defects

Although skeletal manifestations collectively affect up to 50% of
NF1 patients [44,45,46,47], the cellular mechanism(s) underlying
the development of
in NF1 patients are
incompletely characterized. Previous attempts using other murine
models have identified single lineage and phenotypic alterations
that do not fully recapitulate the pathological phenotypes observed
in individuals with NF1 [32,33,48,49]. The genetic intercrosses
conducted in the present study provide novel murine models

In the present study, we generated two novel murine models
using Cre-mediated recombination under the direction of either
the MSC/osteoblast-selective periostin fragment promoter or the
osteoblast-specific Col2.3 Cre promoter. In these mice, one Nf1
allele was systemically deleted from all tissues (global knockout),
while the remaining allele was conditionally deleted in mesenchy-
mal stem/progenitor cells and/or osteoblasts. The two models
allow us to compare the impact of the deficiency of Nf1 at different
stages during MSC and osteoblast development of the skeletal

deficits. PeriCre
increased osteoclast development compared to control mice in vivo.
In addition, these mice display reduced bone mineral density
(BMD) and impaired fracture healing compared to control mice.
Recent studies have begun to elucidate the interactions between
haploinsufficient and nullizygous Nf1 cells within the slow growing
tumors found in individuals with NF1. Consistent with Nf1 being a
tumor suppressor gene, Zhu, et al have shown that nullizygosity of
Nf1 in the tumorigenic Schwann cell is required for plexiform
neurofibroma progression [15]. However,
in this model which
results in a small fraction of Nf12/2 Schwann cells that likely
appear analogous to the human situation, haploinsufficiency in
non-tumorigenic lineages is also required [15]. Furthermore,
Daginakatte, et al. have shown a similar phenomenon in optic
gliomas in the NF1 murine model [13,14]. Recently, we reported
that haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in the hematopoietic microenviron-
ment specifically has a critical role in plexiform neurofibroma
formation [12]. Thus, while there is a structural framework that
explains the development of slow growing tumors in NF1 patients,
no such pathogenic framework to explain the genesis of non-
malignant conditions exists. In the present study, we showed that
the full development of skeletal manifestations in the NF1 murine

model requires both the loss of Nf1 in osteoblast precursors/
osteoblasts and the haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in the hematopoietic
microenvironment. This data is consistent with a single case report
by Stevenson and colleagues who found that localized nullizygous
loss of NF1 in pseudarthrosis tissue is acquired by micro-dissection
and NF1 haploinsufficiency in peripheral blood [29].

Given that our adoptive transfer study indicates that the Nf1
haploinsufficient bone marrow cells are important for non-union
to occur and WT bone marrow cells restores fracture healing,
these observations lead to opportunities of clinical and therapeutic
+
;Nf1flox/2 mice trans-
significance. Here, we show that PeriCre
planted with Nf1+/2, but not WT bone marrow, exhibit impaired
fracture healing. Most importantly, WT transplantation of bone
+
;Nf1flox/2 and
marrow restored fracture healing of PeriCre
+
;Nf1flox/2 mice. We previously reported a key role for
Col2.3Cre
Nf1 haploinsufficiency in the elevated bone resorptive activity in
both murine and human NF1 osteoclasts [31]. This lineage is likely
the key effector of the microenvironment. To our knowledge, this
study provides
the first evidence of a non-cell autonomous
mechanism for the pathologic development of non-malignant
NF1 pathologic manifestations. As such, these models provide an
excellent platform to further study the cellular and molecular
mechanism(s) underlying skeletal manifestations in NF1 patients.
Future research investigating the specific lineage and molecular
targets in the microenvironment that are critical for the non-union
fracture healing in NF1 is necessary.

Collectively,

these data demonstrate a critical role of

the
hematopoietic microenvironment in fracture healing in the NF1
population. Our study provides strong evidence of a non-cell
autonomous mechanism for the skeletal manifestations of NF1 and
demonstrates that the hematopoietic microenvironment is instru-
mental for bone loss and impaired fracture healing process.

2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% deoxycholate, and 0.02%
NonidetP40, tissues/cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37uC with
b -gal staining solution containing 50 mg b -gal (Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.106 g potassium ferrocyanide,
and 0.082 g potassium ferricyanide in 50 ml wash buffer. After the
staining, tissues/cells were washed 3 times with PBS and placed
overnight in 10% formalin. The samples were then decalcified
with 14% EDTA and embedded in paraffin. 6 mm thick sections
were stained for LacZ with a hematoxylin counterstain.

Longitudinal in vivo peripheral dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (pDEXA)

To evaluate the bone mass in each genotype of mice, bone
mineral density (BMD) of the tibial diaphysis was evaluated in vivo
using pDEXA (PIXImus II; GE-Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) [48].
Adult mice were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane
(IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) mixed with O2
(1.5 liter/min). The mice were placed in a prone position on the
specimen tray and scanned. The head was excluded from total
body scans. The region of interest included the central 50% of the
whole tibia.

Micro (m) computed tomography

the distal

Bone volume and microarchitecture in the distal

femoral
metaphysis were evaluated using a high-resolution desktop
microcomputed tomography imaging system (mCT-20; Scanco
Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland). For evaluation of
the
trabecular envelope at
femoral metaphysis, each
specimen was scanned with a slice increment of 9 mm. CT images
filtered (s = 0.8 and support = 1.0), and
were reconstructed,
thresholded (22% of maximum possible gray scale value) as
previously described [53]. Scanning for the femur was started at
15% of the total femur length measured from the tip of the femoral
condyle and extended proximally for 200 slices. The area for
trabecular analysis was outlined within the trabecular compart-
ment, excluding the cortical and subcortical bone. Every 10
sections were outlined manually, and the intermediate sections
were interpolated with the contouring algorithm to create a
volume of
interest. Parameters of microarchitecture for both
skeletal sites included bone volume (BV, mm3) and bone volume
fraction (BV/TV, %), as well as trabecular number (Tb.N, mm21),
(Tb.Th, mm), and trabecular separation
trabecular thickness
(Tb.Sp, mm).

Fluorochrome bone labeling and histomorphometric
measurements

Fluorochrome labeling of the bones was performed in 8 week-
old mice by intraperitoneal injections of calcein (20 mg/kg, Sigma
Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) and alizarin (20 mg/kg, Sigma) 8
and 3 days before sacrifice, as previously described [54]. After
sacrifice,
femurs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
for 48 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and embedded

undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. Frontal sections (4 mm thick)
were cut from the distal femur using a motorized microtome
equipped with a tungsten-carbide knife (Leica Inc, Deerfield Il).
The sections were reacted with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRACP) for identifying and measuring the osteoclast surface or
mounted unstained for fluorochrome-derived bone formation
tibia was viewed at 1606
parameters. One section per
magnification on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Mikroskopie
und System GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and the image captured
using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.,
Sterling Heights, MI). The measurement area for the distal
femoral metaphysis was determined by a region beginning 0.5 mm
proximal to the midpoint of the growth plate, non-inclusive of
cortical bone, and extending proximally for a total area of
approximately 2.8 mm2. Trabecular bone turnover was assessed
by measuring the extent of single label
(sL.Pm), double label
(dL.Pm) and the area of bone (dL.Ar) between the calcein and
alizarin labels using Image Pro Plus version 4.1 software (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Derived histomorphometric
parameters included mineralizing surface (MS/BS, %), a measure
of active bone-forming surface, calculated as follows: the [K
sL.Pm+dL.Pm]/Tt.Pm * 100; mineral apposition rate (MAR, mm/
day), a measure of the rate of radial expansion of new bone,
calculated as follows: dL.Ar/dL.Pm/4 dy; and bone formation
rate, an overall measure of bone formation that combines MS/BS
and MAR, calculated as follows: MS/BS * MAR * 3.65.

For histological analysis of cell populations, after sacrifice, tibiae
were dissected from the mice and were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanols,
and embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. Frontal
sections (4 mm thick) were cut from the tibiae using a motorized
microtome equipped with a tungsten-carbide knife (Leica Inc,
Deerfield Il). The sections were reacted with TRACP for
identification and measuring of osteoclast surface. MacNeal and
/or von Kossa staining were utilized for identifying osteoblasts and
calcified bones. The sections were viewed at 2006 magnification
on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Mikroskopie und System
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and the images were captured using a
SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling
Heights, MI). The quantification of osteoblast cell number and
osteoclast
surface were normalized to the bone surface in
millimeters (mm), to control for the total amount of trabecular
bone surface within each histological section.

Generation of fracture and X-ray scan

A single tibial fracture was induced as described previously
[55,56,57]. With the animal lying supine on the operating table,
an intramedullary rod (a 30-G needle) was surgically inserted via
the proximal end of the tibiae into the medullary canal of the tibia,
so as to stabilize the bone post-fracture and permit load-bearing. A
200-gram weight was dropped from a height of 30-cm to fracture
the tibia between the middle to lower 1/3 of the bone. Mice were
X-rayed following the fracture to verify standardization of the

fractures. The mice were allowed to recover on a heated pad and
then placed in recovery cages. Fracture repair was monitored by
weekly radiography (pixRay-100, Bioptics, Phoenix, AZ) and cases
where the internal fixation failed, (due to pin slippage, bending or
breakage) the affected mouse was euthanized and excluded from
subsequent analysis.

MSC and committed osteoprogenitor culture in murine
specimens

MSCs were generated from each experimental group of mice
as previously described [49]. Briefly, BM mononuclear cells
(BMMNCs) were separated by low density gradient centrifugation
from 6,8-week old mice. BMMNCs were then resuspended and
cultured in mouse MesenCult basal medium containing MesenCult
Supplement (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) at a concentration of
26106 cells/mL in a 10-cm tissue culture plate as previously
described. When the cultures reached 80â€“90% confluency, cells
were trypsinized and replated at a concentration of 56105 cells/
75 cm2. MSCs at passage 5 to 10 were used for the following
experiments. To culture committed osteoprogenitors, calvaria or
femur distal metaphyses were resected and chopped finely with a
scalpel. Bone chips were exposed to 0.25% trypsin for 1 hour and
then passed through a 70-mm cell strainer (Falcon, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) to remove debris and matrix remnants. Cells were cultured
in a-MEM medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillinâ€“streptomycin at 37uC, 5% CO2.

Bone marrow transplantation of hematopoietic cells

106 syngeneic WT or Nf1+/2 bone marrow cells from WT
GFP or Nf1+/2 GFP mice were transplanted into young adult
PeriCre;Nf1flox/flox recipient mice following 1100 rads of ionizing
radiation with two split doses [12]. The C57BL/6-TgN(ACT-
bEGFP) 1Osb transgenic mouse line was obtained from Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine [58].

Statistical analysis. One way ANOVA and post t-test was used
for all the statistical analysis in this study. P values less than 0.05
are considered as statistically significant.
