Tumor angiogenesis in childhood neuroblastoma is an important prognostic factor suggesting a potential role for
antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of high-risk disease. Within the KidsCancerKinome project, we evaluated the new oral
selective pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib (AG-013736) against neuroblastoma cell lines and the subcutaneous
and orthotopic xenograft model IGR-N91 derived from a primary bone marrow metastasis. Axitinib reduced cell
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 doses between 274 and >10,000 nmol/l. Oral treatment with 30 mg/kg
BID for 2 weeks in advanced tumors yielded significant tumor growth delay, with a median time to reach five times
initial tumor volume of 11.4 days compared to controls (p 5 0.0006) and resulted in significant reduction in
bioluminescence. Simultaneous inhibition of VEGFR downstream effector mTOR using rapamycin 20 mg/kg q2d35 did not
statistically enhance tumor growth delay compared to single agent activities. Axitinib downregulated VEGFR-2
phosphorylation resulting in significantly decreased microvessel density (MVD) and overall surface fraction of tumor vessels
(OSFV) in all xenografts as measured by CD34 immunohistochemical staining (mean MVD 6 SD and OSFV at 14 days 21.27
6 10.03 in treated tumors vs. 48.79 6 17.27 in controls and 0.56% vs. 1.29%; p 5 0.0006, respectively). We further
explored the effects of axitinib on circulating mature endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs)
measured by flow cytometry. While only transient modification was observed for CECs, CEP counts were significantly
reduced during and up to 14 days after end of treatment. Axitinib has potent antiangiogenic properties that may warrant
further evaluation in neuroblastoma.

Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extra cranial solid tumor
of early childhood.
It shows extremely variable behavior
ranging from spontaneous regression to highly aggressive dis-
ease resistant to all currently available treatment modalities.1
New treatment approaches, in particular, in advanced disease,
are therefore urgently required.

In neuroblastoma, high numbers of microvessel counts
have been described,2,3 as well as frequent angiogenic growth
factor expression such as vascular endothelial factor (VEGF).
Furthermore, downregulation of the physiological angiogenic
growth inhibitors actinin A and thrombospondin correlate
with advanced stages.4‚Äì6 Tumor angiogenesis may therefore

represent a promising therapeutic target, especially when me-
tastases are present.7 While antiangiogenic compounds have
deÔ¨Åned a role in the management of adult cancers,8 its utility
in the management of pediatric malignancies has not been
explored to the same extent.

Tumor angiogenesis is a complex process involving multi-
ple pro- and antiangiogenic factors. Consequently, inhibiting
this process using single or multiple agents, with or without
inhibitors of downstream effectors, remains a Ô¨Åeld of inten-
sive research. The VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling
pathway through activation of PI-3K/AKT/mTOR down-
stream effectors plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis.
Several agents, such as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody
bevacizumab, the multikinase inhibitors sunitinib (targeting
VEGFR-2, PDGFR, KIT and Flt-3) and soraÔ¨Ånib (anti-
VEGFR-2, PDGFR, b-Raf, Flt-3 and KIT) targeting this path-
way have been received approval for the treatment of cancers.
Preclinical studies reported antitumor effects of bevacizumab,
sunitinib and vandetanib in neuroblastoma.9‚Äì13 In addition to
the inhibition of the sprouting process originating from blood
vessels in the surrounding of new tumors,
the recently
described participation of circulating endothelial cells (CECs)
in tumor angiogenesis, the circulating endothelial progenitors
from the bone marrow (CEPs), as well as mature CECs seem
to represent additional targets for antiangiogenic strategies.14
In neuroblastoma, statistically higher numbers of CEPs have
been detected in patients with metastasized pediatric solid
tumors, including stage 4 neuroblastoma.15

Axitinib (AG-013736) is a novel, potent, small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits VEGFR-1, -2
and -3 at sub-nanomolar concentrations. Axitinib inhibits
angiogenesis, vascular permeability and blood Ô¨Çow.16 In non-
clinical models, axitinib inhibited the growth of primary
tumors in human xenografts by interacting with tumor
angiogenesis in colorectal, breast, melanoma and glial tumors.
It also decreased metastasis to lung and lymph nodes in mu-
rine lung and melanoma models.17 Axitinib has shown prom-
ising single agent activity in advanced malignancies.18‚Äì21 It
was granted orphan drug status by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2007 for the treatment of pancre-
atic cancer.22 Accrual to two Phase III randomized clinical
trials of axitinib in the treatment of renal and pancreatic can-
cers, as a single agent and in combination therapy, respec-
tively, has been completed.

Our study explored the preclinical activity of axitinib in
human neuroblastoma, its combination with the mTOR an-
tagonist rapamycin, as well as the angiogenesis mechanisms
involved.

Material and Methods
Drugs
Axitinib (AG-013736) was provided by PÔ¨Åzer (La Jolla, CA)
as a white to light yellow crystalline powder and stored, pro-
tected from light, at 4C. For in vitro use, a 10 nmol/l stock
solution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was stored at  20C.

Int. J. Cancer: 128, 2748‚Äì2758 (2011) VC 2010 UICC

For in vivo experiments, axitinib was formulated once every
7‚Äì10 days in a homogeneous suspension of 0.5% carboxyl
methylcellulose (CMC;
ICN Pharmaceuticals SA, Orsay,
France) while protected from light and at 4C during the
studies. Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA), stored at  20C, and diluted in ethanol for
stock solution and water for Ô¨Ånal use.

Cell lines and xenografts
The IGR-N91 cell line and xenograft were derived from the
bone marrow of chemotherapy-pretreated stage 4 neuroblas-
toma of an 8-year-old boy.23 The IGR-NB8 cell
line was
derived from a primary stage 3 abdominal neuroblastoma of
a 5-year-old boy.24 The cell lines LAN-5, IMR-32, SK-N-SH,
SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y were kindly provided by Dr. A.
Valent (Genetic unit, Institut Gustave Roussy). All neuroblas-
toma cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs modiÔ¨Åed Eagle‚Äôs
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (all Invi-
trogen SARL, Cergy Pontoise, France). HUVEC cells (pur-
chased from Cell Applications, p/a Tebu-Bio, Le Perray en
Yvelines, France) were grown in endothelial cell basal me-
dium-2 (EMBVR -2, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented
the recommended growth factor mixture (BBE, FBS, hEGF,
GA1000 and hydrocortisone) and with 10% fetal calf serum.

MTS cell proliferation assay
HUVEC, SH-SY5Y, IGR-N91 and IGR-NB8 cell
lines were
seeded at 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and left to
settle overnight in EMBVR -2 or DMEM with 10% fetal calf se-
rum. The cells were treated with axitinib at concentrations
ranging from 1 nmol/l to 10 lmol/l. Cell viability was deter-
mined after 72 hr using MTS tetrazolium substrate (CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega
Corporation, Charbonnieres, France) and colorimetric measure-
ment at 490 nm in an automatic plate reader (Elx808; Fisher
Bioblock ScientiÔ¨Åc SAS, Illkirch, France). IC50 values were cal-
culated using GraphPadVR Prism software (version 3.00).

Experimental in vivo studies
All animal experiments were carried out under the conditions
established by the European Community (Directive 86/609/
CCE). IGR-N91 tumor fragments (30 mm3) were xenotrans-
planted subcutaneously in the right Ô¨Çank of female SPF-Swiss
athymic nude mice at 6‚Äì8 weeks of age. After 3‚Äì4 weeks,
animals bearing subcutaneous tumors of 100‚Äì300 mm3 were
randomly assigned to treatment groups on Day 0 (i.e., the
start of treatment). Axitinib was administered at 30 mg/kg
BID per oral gavage for 2 weeks; control animals received
0.5% CMC. Rapamycin was administered intravenously at
20 mg/kg every 2 days for Ô¨Åve administrations (q2d5).
Tumors were measured twice weekly and volumes calculated
according to the equation: V (mm3) ¬º width2 (mm2)  length
(mm)/2. The experiments continued until
tumor volumes
reached 1,500 mm3. Tumor doubling time (Td) was determined
in the exponential growth phase between 200 and 400 mm3 by

using cubic spline Ô¨Åtted curves and graphs in the Prism pro-
gram. Therapeutic activity was evaluated by complete and
partial tumor regression (i.e., total tumor regression or tumor
volume <15 mm3 and >50% decrease in tumor volume,
respectively, in at least two consecutive measurements), tu-
mor growth delay (TGD; median time in days to reach Ô¨Åve
times initial tumor volume of treatment group compared to
controls) and number of tumor-free survivors at Day 120.
For the orthotopic neuroblastoma model, 1  106 IGR-
N91 cells, transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid wearing LUC
gene to express Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Çy luciferase, were injected into the left
adrenal in NOD/Scid mice under general anesthesia proce-
dure with isoÔ¨Çouran. Axitinib 30 mg/kg BID was adminis-
tered for 19 days starting at Day 4 after transplantation (with
a 2-day holiday after 12 days). Tumor growth was followed
by bioluminescence imaging using IVISVR 50 (Caliper Life Sci-
ence S.A., Trembley, France) once or twice weekly. Mice
were sacriÔ¨Åced at Day 18 and tumor load was estimated by
bioluminescence imaging.

The two-tailed nonparametric Mann‚ÄìWhitney or Krus-
kal‚ÄìWallis test and Prism software was used to determine
statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of the median time to reach Ô¨Åve times
initial tumor volume or bioluminescence uptake.

Western immunoblotting
Cell or tumor lysates were isolated using lysis buffer contain-
ing 50 nM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% IGEPAL, 0.3% Triton
X100, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glyc-
erol, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail

(Complete mini, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Equal
amounts of protein (40 lg) were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE
and electrophoretically transferred on to hydrophobic polyvi-
nylidene diÔ¨Çuoride (PVDF) membranes optimized for protein
transfer (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France).
The membranes were probed after a blocking procedure with
the mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-human VEGFR-1 (Flt-
1; 1:1,000), human VEGFR-2/KDR (1:1,000; both R&D Sys-

(1:20; Hycult Biotechnology, The Netherlands) and rabbit anti-

using PixCytVR
image analysis software (GRECAN (Groupe
Regional d‚ÄôEtudes sur le Cancer), Centre Fran√ßois Baclesse,
Caen, France.25 The resolution was 4,000 dots per inch with
1 pixel covering an area of 40 lm2. The microvessel density
(MVD) proÔ¨Åles are expressed as the number of vessels per
square millimeter and as surface fraction (%) of tumor tissue.

Measurement of CECs and CEPs
Whole blood (250 ll) was drawn through retro-orbital ve-
nous puncture on Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 from mice bear-
ing IGR-N91 xenografts during axitinib treatment at 30 mg/
kg BID for 2 weeks. CEC and CEP counts were measured by
four-color Ô¨Çow cytometry as previously reported (unpub-
lished data, Taylor et al., submitted). BrieÔ¨Çy, CECs were
detected using the rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies
anti-MECA-32 biotin, anti-CD31 FITC, anti-CD45 PerCP,
anti-Flt-1 PE and streptavidin-APC (all BD Pharmingen, NJ).
CEPs were detected using the rat anti-mouse monoclonal
antibodies anti-Sca-1-FITC or anti-CD31-FITC, anti-Flk-1-
PE, anti-CD45-PerCP and anti-CD-117-APC (all BD Phar-
mingen). Isotypic control tubes included Ô¨Çuorochrome-conju-
gated rat anti-mouse isotypic controls. Cells were acquired
on a FACSCalibur and analyzed by CELLQuest 3.2 software
(both BD Biosciences). Additionally, white blood cell counts
were determined for each murine blood sample using a MS9-
3 counter (Melet Schloesing, Osny, France) for calculations
of absolute counts of CECs and CEPs.

The variation of the CEP and CEC numbers in blood
through the time from Day 0 to Day 28 was assessed by
examining the time-concentration relationship. The primary
parameter was the population-averaged slope a determined
by using the linear mixed model:
yij ¬º b0 √æ a √æ ai

where yij is the response (CEP or CEC blood concentration)
of the mouse i at the day j, b0 √æ (a √æ ai)*tij is the expected
value of the response for the mouse i at the day tij, which
illustrate a linear relation between the response and the time
with a slope (a √æ ai) and an intercept b0, b0 is the baseline

quantitative covariate (0 for the Day 0, 1 for the Day 1, 2 for
the Day 2, etc.), (a √æ ai) is the subject-speciÔ¨Åc slope of the
mouse i, a is the mean if these slope in the population
(called population-averaged slope in the mixed model litera-
ture) and ai is an individual random effect and eij is the ran-
dom error term for mouse i at the day j.

All data from a given mouse were included in this model;
statistical analysis was performed using the mixed procedure
of the SAS software which determined the p value of the test
of the null hypothesis a ¬º 0, which is equivalent to the fact
that the blood concentration of the CEC or CEP do not vary
with time in the population.

A mixed Emax model26,27 was Ô¨Åtted for the CEP data using
the Nlmixed procedure of the SAS software. This model Ô¨Åts
better these data than the linear mixed model, but it was not
possible to Ô¨Åt it for the CEC data. This model is explained by
the following equation:

CEPij ¬º E0 √æ √∞Emax √æ a1i√û
tij
√∞ED50 √æ a2i√û √æ tij

√æ eij

where CEPij is the CEP blood concentration of the mouse i
at the day j, E0 √æ √∞Emax√æa1i√ûtij
is the expected value of the
√∞ED50√æa2i√û√ætij
CEP response for the mouse i at the day tij, E0 is the basal
effect, corresponding to the mean response when the time is
zero (before administration of the drug), Emax √æ a1i is the
maximum effect attributable to the drug for the mouse i, Emax
is the mean of these maximum effects through the population
of all mice (or its typical value in this population) and a1i is a
random individual effect. ED50 √æ a2i is the time in which half
of Emax is produced for the mouse i, ED50 is the mean of these
times in the population of all mice (or its typical value in this
population) and a2i is a random individual effect.
The expected value of the Emax model (E0 √æ √∞Emax√æa1i√ûtij
)
√∞ED50√æa2i√û√ætij
illustrates the fact that the expected value of the response can
increase or decrease hyperbolically. If the response is decreas-
ing, the value of the Emax parameter will be negative. Note the
difference between Emax, which is the maximal effect attribut-
able to the drug, and (E0 √æ Emax), which is the asymptotic
response. The Emax model is usually used to model the monot-
onous not linearity with an effect threshold (E0 √æ Emax).

Our parameter of interest in this study is the Emax param-
eter, which characterizes the population; the fact that it is
equal to zero is equivalent to the fact that the mean of the
response is constant in this population. The p value of the
test of the null hypothesis Emax ¬º 0 was obtained.

Results

neuroblastoma cells
All neuroblastoma cell lines tested, LAN-5, IMR32, SK-N-SH,
SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y,
exhibited
VEGFR-2 expression as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1).

N-SH, SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y, IGR-NB8 and IGR-N91 neuroblastoma cell

lines were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% SDS-PAGE,

transferred to PVDF membrane and visualized using Western

blotting with speciÔ¨Åc antibodies to VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3

(1:1,000), detected with anti-mouse antibodies (1:5,000) and

enhanced chemiluminescent substrate. The blots were reprobed

with anti-actin as loading control. HUVEC cells were used as

controls.

We further found VEGFR-3 expressed in LAN-5, IMR-32,
SK-N-AS and SH-SY5Y, but not in SK-N-BE, IGR-NB8 and
IGR-N91. VEGFR-1 expression was not found on the cell
lines tested compared to the positive HUVEC cells.

Axitinib reduces neuroblastoma cell proliferation in vitro
HUVEC and the IGR-N91, IGR-NB8 and SH-SY5Y neuro-
blastoma cell lines were cultured under standard conditions
and treated with axitinib at concentrations ranging from
1 nmol/l to 10 lmol/l. Axitinib reduced cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner with IC50 doses of >10,000, 849 and
274 nmol/l for IGR-N91, IGR-NB8 and SH-SY5Y, respec-
tively, as measured by MTS assay at 72 hr (Fig. 2). In our
hands, the sensitivity to axitinib of neuroblastoma cell lines
appeared to be in a similar range as non-VEGF stimulated
HUVEC (IC50, 573 nmol/l), whereas IC50s 1,000 times lower
had been reported in the literature for VEGF-stimulated en-
dothelial cells HUVEC (IC50, 0.17 nmol/l).17

Axitinib exhibits signiÔ¨Åcant antitumor activity against
neuroblastoma Ô¨Çank xenografts alone and

Axitinib was Ô¨Årst evaluated as a single agent in vivo against
IGR-N91 Ô¨Çank xenografts at advanced tumor stage (Table 1,
AG-013736 (axitinib) alone and Fig. 3a). Athymic mice bear-
ing tumors of 50‚Äì262 mm3 were randomly assigned 25 days
after transplantation to treatment groups of 11 tumors each.
According to prior experiments in various human cancer
models showing maximum growth inhibiting effects,17 axitinib
was administered orally at a dosage of 30 mg/kg BID for 14
days; control animals received 0.5% carboxyl methylcellulose
in equivalent amount and schedule. Control tumors grew

with a median tumor doubling time of 4.8 days (range, 3.5‚Äì
8.7 days) and reached a median of Ô¨Åve times initial tumor
volume at 14 days (range, 9.3‚Äì17.6 days). Axitinib treatment
did not result in partial or complete tumor regression and
the median time to reach Ô¨Åve times initial tumor volume was
25.4 days (range, 15.7‚Äì34.6 days), representing a signiÔ¨Åcant
difference in tumor growth delay of 11.4 days when com-
pared to the controls (p ¬º 0.0006; Mann‚ÄìWhitney test).

VEGFR signaling activates downstream effectors such as
AKT and mTOR suggesting that combinations with one of
their inhibitors may have superior activity. We therefore fur-
ther explored the activity of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
in combination with axitinib against IGR-N91 xenografts
(Table 1, AG-013736 (axitinib) and rapamycin and Fig. 3b).
As observed in the Ô¨Årst experiment, axitinib resulted in sig-
niÔ¨Åcant tumor growth delay of 17.7 days compared to con-
trols (p < 0.01; Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test); the median time to reach

lines. Neuroblastoma cell lines IGR-N91, IGR-NB8, SH-SY5Y and

HUVEC cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal

calf serum or EMBVR -2 and treated with axitinib at concentrations
ranging from 1 nmol/l to 10 lmol/l. Cell viability was measured by
MTS proliferation assay at 72 hr.

Ô¨Åve times initial tumor volume was 27.2 days (range, 19.3‚Äì29.6
days) compared to 9.5 days (range, 7.9‚Äì26.2 days) in controls
which exhibited a median tumor doubling time of 3.9 days
(2.4‚Äì4.8 days). Tumors treated with rapamycin administered
intravenously at 20 mg/kg every 2 days for Ô¨Åve doses reached a
median of Ô¨Åve times initial tumor volume at 20.5 days (range,
18.9‚Äì27.8 days), thus a median tumor growth delay of 11.5
days compared to controls (ns). Simultaneous administration of
both agents resulted in a median Ô¨Åve times initial tumor vol-
umes of 26.0 days (range, 21.4‚Äì30.1 days) and thus a signiÔ¨Å-
cant median tumor growth delay of 16.5 days (p < 0.01),
which was however not enhanced compared to axitinib alone.

Axitinib exhibits signiÔ¨Åcant antitumor activity against
orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts
To explore antitumor effects in a relevant in vivo model, we
used a recently developed orthotopic model of IGR-N91
injected into the left adrenal of NOD/Scid mice. Treatment
with axitinib 30 mg/kg or equivalent 0.5% CMC BID was
started at Day 4 after transplantation. All animals developed
local tumors as measured by bioluminescence imaging. Treat-
ment of axitinib for 18 days resulted in reduced biolumines-
cent signals as compared to controls (p ¬º 0.0262 in Mann‚Äì
Whitney test; Fig. 3c).

Axitinib inhibits VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in
neuroblastoma xenografts in vivo
We next explored the mechanism of axitinib treatment
in vivo in the IGR-N91 Ô¨Çank model. Animals bearing IGR-
N91 tumors were treated with axitinib at 30 mg/kg BID or
methylcellulose during 14 days; then tumors were harvested and
protein lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. Treat-
ment with axitinib resulted in downregulation of VEGFR-2
phosphorylation in all three IGR-N91 xenograft tumor samples
compared to controls. However, downstream effectors such as
activated AKT and MAPK were not inhibited (Fig. 4a).

for CD34 staining by immunohistochemistry. Axitinib treat-
ment resulted in signiÔ¨Åcant reduction of tumor vasculariza-
tion as shown by CD34 immunohistochemical staining (Fig.
4b). The MVD per square meter determined was 21.27 6
10.03 in treated tumors compared to 48.79 6 17.27 in con-
trols (p ¬º 0.0023; Mann‚ÄìWhitney test) (Fig. 4c). This antitu-
mor vessel activity was conÔ¨Årmed by determining the overall
surface fraction of tumor vessels (OSFV), which was 0.56%
6 0.17% in treated tumors versus 1.29% 6 0.37 in controls
(p ¬º 0.0006; Fig. 4d).

Axitinib therapy decreases the numbers of CEP but not
CEC in mice bearing neuroblastoma xenografts
CECs and CEPs are currently being investigated in a variety
of diseases as markers of vascular turnover or damage and,
also in the case of CEPs, vasculogenesis, as well as their role
as potential surrogate markers for monitoring antiangiogenic
therapy. Therefore, we measured CEC and CEP levels by
four-color Ô¨Çow cytometric assay in whole blood in athymic
mice bearing advanced IGR-N91 tumors drawn before, on
Days 7 and 14 during axitinib treatment as well as on Day
21 and 28, i.e., during 14 days after stop of treatment. Mean
(6SD) CEC numbers were 0.27 6 0.08, 0.31 6 0.11, 0.08 6
0.18, 0.10 6 0.10 and 0.38 6 0.45 cells/ll at baseline, on
Days 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. CEPs were reduced dur-
ing the axitinib treatment and for at least 14 days after the
end of treatment: 0.40 6 0.08, 0.02 6 0.03, 0.00 6 0.01, 0.08
6 0.10 and 0.03 6 0.02 cells/ll before treatment and on
Days 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. We wished to develop a
model that allows statistical evaluation of these potential bio-
markers and their variation with time of treatment. When
applying a mixed linear model on all data, no signiÔ¨Åcant
modiÔ¨Åcation was conÔ¨Årmed for numbers of CECs (p ¬º
0.4556; Fig. 5a). For CEPs, both a mixed linear and mixed
Emax model (Fig. 5b) were applied and showed a signiÔ¨Åcant
decrease in the CEP levels over time (p ¬º 0.0096 and 0.0007,
respectively). The Akaike information criteria (AIC:  19.6 vs.
 42.8, respectively), bias-corrected Akaike information crite-
ria corrected (AICC:  19.5 vs.  39.3) and the Bayesian in-
formation criteria (BIC:  19.5 vs.  42.2) values showed that
the Emax model was more adequate for these data than the
linear model. The graphs suggested further that the CEP ob-
servation on Day 21 for mouse 35 could be a potential out-
lier; an exclusion of this observation resulted in a p value of
0.0002 for the Emax parameter of the mixed Emax model.
Thus, CEP could represent a pharmacodynamic marker for
antiangiogenic treatment.

Discussion
Axitinib has been developed as a selective inhibitor of
VEGFR-1,  2 and  3. In comparison to the multikinase
inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib that also have an inhibitory
activity on several other tyrosine kinase receptors, which are
also expressed on tumor cells,28 it has demonstrated an anti-
angiogenic activity that is stronger and more speciÔ¨Åc. We

setting. The VEGF/VEGFR pathway seems to act primarily
by promoting angiogenesis, but it may also function through
promoting neuroblastoma cell growth directly.29 In addition
to the expression of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1 expression may be
required for cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. None of the
neuroblastoma cell
lines tested here expressed VEGFR-1
whereas VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 was present in several or
all of them. The results of studies of VEGFR expression in
neuroblastoma have been conÔ¨Çicting. Most studies of neuro-
blastoma cell lines could not demonstrate an autocrine effect
of VEGF/VEGFR.4,30,31 Although data on tumor specimens
showed VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 expression,
their origin
(tumoral or endothelial) remain unclear.32 In vivo adminis-
tration of axitinib 30 mg/kg, the dose which has been shown

to result in maximum growth inhibiting effects in other xen-
ograft models, resulted in inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphoryl-
ation and led to signiÔ¨Åcant antitumor effects on established
IGR-N91 tumors. The antiangiogenic effects of axitinib
against neuroblastoma xenograft tumor vasculature, as meas-
ured by morphology, MVD and OVSD, were reduced in all
treated tumors compared to controls. However, no signiÔ¨Åcant
morphological cell death features were observed in neuroblas-
toma tumor cells. Axitinib resulted in a reduction in neuro-
blastoma tumor growth compared to controls although no
tumor regression was observed in the three independent in
vivo experiments. This is similar to the prior Ô¨Åndings on axi-
tinib, inhibiting tumor growth in a wide range of different
adult cancer xenograft models.17 We have shown that despite

the inhibitory effects of axitinib on constitutive VEGFR-2
phosphorylation,
its downstream effector pathways PI-3K/
AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK are not inhibited in IGR-N91
xenografts. Both cell signaling pathways are also activated by
the majority of growth factor receptors. Several publications
have reported that c-kit, PDFGR, EGFR or IGF-1R may play
a role in neuroblastoma cell growth. In this regard, we have
recently shown that stimulated AKT and MAPK pathways in
neuroblastoma cell lines could be reduced by IGF-1R inhibi-
tion.33 The constitutive activation of these downstream effec-
tors tyrosine kinases in IGR-N91 may be a result of activa-
tion of other growth factors rather than VEGF/VEGFR and
thus their inhibition is not to be expected following unique
VEGFR inhibition. Most antiangiogenic compounds are cur-
rently being developed in combination with either chemo-
therapy or other targeted agents. We evaluated the effect of
axitinib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor rapamy-
cin. This molecule has been shown to reduce VEGF levels
as well as inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation.34 In our
study, rapamycin resulted in tumor growth delay of IGR-
N91 xenografts, however, when administered in combina-
tion with axitinib, did not result in a signiÔ¨Åcant improve-
ment of its single agent activity. This Ô¨Ånding is contrary to
recent reports in relation to the multikinase inhibitor sunitinib
where low dose sunitinib demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity
with rapamycin.10 Axitinib in combination with other thera-
pies, such as ionizing radiation,35 low dose, metronomic cyclo-
phosphamide28 and docetaxel17 have shown more promise. De-

We recently reported that there is an elevation of CEPs
which is related to advanced and metastatic disease in chil-
dren including those with neuroblastoma.15 These CEPs,
which originate from the bone marrow, showed an important
role in the metastatic process and for neuroblastoma to
relapse despite the presence of minimal residual disease.14
We have recently developed a method to determine CECs
and CEPs in murine models and have shown that there is an
acute and immediate increase of CEPs following treatment
with vascular disrupting agents as well as a second burst after
4 days (unpublished data: Taylor et al., submitted). For the
phenotypic identiÔ¨Åcation of CEPs, we have chosen to use
both progenitor (CD117/Sca-1) and endothelial (VEGFR-2)
markers. Pro-angiogenic CEP mobilization has also been
reported for certain chemotherapeutic agents.37 To our
knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst time it has been demonstrated
that these VEGFR-2 expressing bone marrow derived CEPs
were signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced following angiogenic treatment
with axitinib. CEPs remained signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced during
and at least 14 days after the end of treatment. This Ô¨Ånding

suggests a role for the use of antiangiogenic agents, such as
axitinib, not only for their direct antiangiogenic potential
but also for its capacity to reduce chemotherapy-induced
rebound effect on these pro-angiogenic cells. Whether CEPs
could be useful as pharmacodynamic markers of efÔ¨Åcacy for
antiangiogenic treatments will need to be determined. In
our experience, a mixed Emax model was found to be most
suitable for these observations; however, this will need to be
further explored in higher numbers, possibly within a clini-
cal setting.

to current

Antiangiogenic therapy has emerged as a promising addi-
tion to the management of solid tumors. Several antiangio-
genic agents have received licensed indications for the treat-
ment of adult
tumors in the United States and Europe.
Pediatric solid tumors have also been shown to be angiogene-
sis dependent, especially those tumors at advanced stages.38
Neuroblastoma is one of the most studied childhood diseases
with respect to tumor angiogenesis. Advanced tumors are
extremely well vascularized and hence the incorporation of
antiangiogenic strategies
treatment paradigms
could potentially provide a signiÔ¨Åcant advance to a disease of
high unmet medical need.7 Although several antiangiogenic
agents have been evaluated in phase I pediatric clinical trials,
till date,
later phase clinical studies have not evaluated the
addition of antiangiogenic agents as part of the multimodality
treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. This is the case despite
agents such as bevacizumab,39 sunitinib (Dubois et al., pro-
ceedings of ASCO 2008) and sorafenib (Widemann et al.,
proceedings of ASCO 2009) having been shown to be well
tolerated and to having an acceptable toxicity proÔ¨Åle similar
to that observed in adults. Recommended doses for single
agent use have been established for pediatric patients and com-
bination therapies have been started in patients presenting with
metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft
tissue sarcomas (BO20924/ITCC-011; NCT00643565) as well as
in malignant glioma (NCT00381797 and NCT00890786).
Given that the current neuroblastoma protocols for high-risk
patients are quite intensive coupled with the young age of
these patients, careful thought would be required to deÔ¨Åne
optimal study designs.

In conclusion, our data show that axitinib, a selective anti-
angiogenic agent, may be a candidate to be explored in the
clinical trials involving patients with neuroblastoma. In addi-
tion to its well established inhibitory effects on vessel sprout-
ing, we have shown that axitinib has activity against CEPs
known to participate in tumor neo-angiogenesis. Its potential
for synergism with other agents provides an additional attrac-
tion and hence appropriate regimens will need to be further
explored in the context of clinical trials of neuroblastoma.
