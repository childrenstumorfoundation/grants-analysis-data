  Study  Design.    Retrospective  study  comparing  ScoliScore  and 
clinical risk estimates.  
  Objective.    The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  compare  risk 
stratiﬁ cation  between  ScoliScore  and  traditional  clinical  estimates 
to determine whether ScoliScore provides unique information.  
  Summary  of  Background  Data.    ScoliScore  is  a  genetic 
prognostic  test  designed  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  curve  progression 
in skeletally immature patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis 
with  Cobb  angles of 10 °  to 25 ° . Clinicians are  currently trying to 
better  understand  the  role  this  test  may  play  in  guiding  clinical 
decision making because current standards of curve progression are 
largely based on radiographical markers, such as curve magnitude 
and bone age.  
  Methods.    Ninety-one  patients  who  received  ScoliScore  testing 
at  our  center  and  met  study  inclusion  criteria  were  identiﬁ ed. 
Patients  were  given  a  “clinical  risk”  level  using  their  Risser  sign 
and Cobb angle. Assigned clinical risk levels were compared with 
the  ScoliScore  risk  levels  reported  by  the  manufacturer’s  scoring 
algorithm.  
  Results.    ScoliScore  risk  distribution  in  our  population  was  36% 
low risk, 55% intermediate risk, and 9% high risk. This compares 
with 2%, 51%, and 47%, respectively, for comparable clinical risk 
groupings.  Only  25%  of  patients  were  in  the  same  risk  category 
for  both  systems. There  were  no  signiﬁ cant  correlations  between 
ScoliScore  and  age,  race,  menarcheal  status,  Risser  sign,  or  sex. 
There was a positive correlation between the Cobb angle and the

ScoliScore ( r   =  0.581,  P  ⬍ 0.001). Cobb angle remained signiﬁ cant 
in the multivariate regression model ( P  ⬍ 0.001), and Cobb angle 
was found to account for 33.3% of ScoliScore’s variance.  
 Conclusion.    Only  Cobb  angle  showed  signiﬁ cant  correlation 
with  ScoliScore  among  the  socioclinical  variables  studied.  The 
risk distribution of the 2 risk estimation systems examined differed 
markedly: ScoliScore predicted nearly 16 times more low-risk patients 
and more than 5 times fewer high-risk patients. This demonstrates 
that ScoliScore provides unique information to traditional predictors 
of  curve  progression,  advancing  our  understanding  of  the  role  of 
ScoliScore in the clinical setting.

 Although many theories currently exist, the etiology of 

curve  progression  in  adolescent  idiopathic  scoliosis 
(AIS) has yet to be fully elucidated. Although the preva-
lence of curves more than 10 °  is 1.5% to 3.0%, the prevalence 
of curves more than 20 °  and 30 °  is only 0.3% to 0.5% and 
0.2% to 0.3%, respectively.  1   Therefore, only a small subset of 
patients diagnosed with scoliosis progress to the point where 
surgical intervention becomes necessary. Risk of progression 
has been shown to correlate with multiple clinical risk factors, 
including  sex,  chronological  age,  menarcheal  status,  hand 
bone age, Risser sign, and curve pattern.  2   –   4   Unfortunately, the 
ability of these clinical risk factors to predict signiﬁ cant pro-
gression is limited, and there is great interest in developing 
more accurate methods of risk assessment. 

 Several genetic markers have been shown to be associated 
with  the  development  and  progression  of  curves  in  AIS,  5   ,   6   
including  estrogen  receptors,  7    melatonin,  8    and  calmodulin.  9   
Investigations  conducted  by  Axial  Biotech  (Salt  Lake  City, 
Utah)  of  more  than  9500  patients  at  more  than  100  clini-
cal  sites  led  to  the  development  of  a  53-gene  panel  called 
“ScoliScore.”  10    This  saliva-based  genetic  test  incorporates 
28 progression and 25 protection-associated markers, along 
with the patient’s Cobb angle at time of testing, into an algo-
rithm used to determine the risk of curve progression requir-
ing  surgery  in  patients  with  AIS.  This  algorithm  is  used  to 
calculate a numeric risk of progression on a scale between 1 
and 200. Patients receiving low scores (1–50) were noted to

have more than a 99% chance of not progressing to a severe 
curve (deﬁ ned as a Cobb angle ⬎ 40 ° ). The risk of progres-
sion  in  patients  receiving  intermediate  scores  (51–180)  was 
1% to 50%, whereas high-risk scores (181–200) were associ-
ated  with  a  50%  to  99%  chance  of  progression.  10    Current 
indications  for  the  test  include  a  diagnosis  of  AIS,  a  Cobb 
angle between 10 °  and 25 ° , skeletal immaturity, and Cauca-
sian race. 

 The promising early results noted by the test’s developers 
suggest that the ScoliScore could prove useful in various clini-
cal scenarios. First, patients receiving low risk scores would 
ultimately  require  less  frequent  follow-up  and  may  be  able 
to avoid or discontinue bracing. This, in turn, would reduce 
health care expenses as well as allow patients to avoid unnec-
essary radiation exposure. Intermediate scores are less predic-
tive and, therefore, unlikely to signiﬁ cantly impact clinician 
decisions regarding management of patients with AIS. High 
scores indicate a signiﬁ cant risk of progression, but how these 
scores should be interpreted is still under consideration. These 
patients may require more frequent follow-up, earlier initia-
tion of bracing, or possibly early surgical intervention using 
newer  growth  modulation  strategies,  such  as  tethering  or 
growing rods. 

 Although  such  implications  of  the  test  sound  promising, 
considerations must be made for the scores returned by the 
test  in  actual  practice.  A  high  rate  of  intermediate  scores 
would limit the test’s clinical utility. Furthermore, given the 
costs of genetic testing, for this to be a clinically useful and 
economically justiﬁ able test, high and low ScoliScores must 
provide unique information to the physician, not just reiter-
ate knowledge that can already be divined from Cobb angle, 
skeletal maturity, and other established clinical risk factors. 
The purpose of this study was to describe the demographic 
and  clinical  characteristics  of  patients  who  have  received 
ScoliScore testing at our institution and to compare ScoliScore 
risk stratiﬁ cation with previously used clinical risk estimates. 
We assumed the null hypothesis that the ScoliScore test will 
stratify patients similarly to clinical predictors of progression, 
limiting the utility of the test. 

  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Spine  Deformity  Center  from  March  5,  2009,  to  April  14, 
2011.  

  ScoliScore Procedure 
 ScoliScore testing was performed at our institution on skel-
etally immature patients with AIS who met ScoliScore crite-
ria and were willing to undergo testing. The indications for 
ScoliScore testing are (1) self-reported Caucasian boy or girl 
(North American, South American, European, Eastern Euro-
pean, Middle Eastern), (2) diagnosis of AIS, (3) aged 9 years 
until skeletal maturity (our group used a Risser grade of  ≤ 4) 
at the time of ScoliScore testing, and (4) major curve Cobb 
angle between 10 °  and 25 ° . Saliva samples for DNA analysis 
are collected in the ofﬁ ce and submitted to the testing center 
along with clinical and demographic information, including 
age, sex, and Cobb angle.  

  Participants 
 Inclusion criteria for this study were the same as the indica-
tions of the ScoliScore test. We did, however, opt to include 1 
patient who had a ScoliScore test done 1 day prior to his or 
her ninth birthday. Patients were excluded if a ScoliScore had 
not  been  returned  at  the  time  of  analysis  or  if  radiographs 
from the time of ScoliScore testing were unavailable. Patients 
were  also  excluded  if  Risser  grading  was  not  possible  on 
their anteroposterior spine radiographs or if they were of less 
than 50% Caucasian descent. During the study period, 155 
patients  submitted  saliva  samples  for  ScoliScore  testing.  Of 
these, 91 satisﬁ ed our inclusion criteria.  

  Data Collection 
 Demographic, clinical, and radiographical data were collected 
for  each  patient.  Risser  signs  were  determined  using  radio-
graphs from the day closest to or the day of ScoliScore testing. 
Seventy-three of the 91 patients obtained radiographs on the 
same day as testing. Of the remaining 18 patients, the maxi-
mum  time  between  radiograph  and  ScoliScore  testing  was 
18 weeks, with a mean of about 5 weeks. All patients were 
assigned a ScoliScore risk level and a “clinical risk” category 
according to their Cobb angle and Risser sign as described by 
Lonstein and Carlson  2   ( Table 1 ).   

  Design and Study Setting 
 After  appropriate  institutional  review  board  approval  was 
obtained, a single-center retrospective analysis was performed 
for patients receiving ScoliScore testing at our institution. The 
study included patients seen at our institution’s Scoliosis and 

  Statistical Analysis 
 Descriptive  analyses  were  performed  for  ScoliScore,  demo-
graphic,  clinical,  and  radiographical  variables.  Pearson  cor-
relation analyses were performed to investigate the relation-
ship  between  ScoliScore  and  continuous  patient  variables.

ScoliScore vs. Clinical Estimates (cid:129) Roye et al

Independent  t  tests were performed to examine differences in 
ScoliScores among categorical patient groups. A  χ  2  analysis 
was  conducted  to  determine  how  the  risk  stratiﬁ cation  dif-
fered  between  the  clinical  risk  and  ScoliScore  risk  schema. 
Multivariate  regression  analysis  was  performed  to  identify 
factors predicting ScoliScore. All analyses were 2-tailed and 
were  conducted  using  SPSS  software  version  18  (SPSS  Inc., 
Chicago, IL). A  P  value of less than 0.05 was considered to 
be signiﬁ cant.   

  RESULTS 

  Patient Characteristics 
 After  appropriate  institutional  review  board  approval  was 
obtained,  the  charts  of  91  patients  matching  the  inclusion 
criteria  for  this  study  were  reviewed.  Study  patients  had  a 
mean age of 11.7 years (range, 8.9–14.6 yr) and a mean Cobb 
angle of 18.8 °  (10 ° –25 ° ). The patients were 91.2% female and 
8.8%  male.  The  majority  of  female  patients  (96.3%)  were 
premenarcheal ( Table 2 ).   

  Clinical Risk Estimates and ScoliScore 
Risk Stratiﬁ cation 
 The average ScoliScore in the cohort was 92.1 (1–199). All 
but 2 of the patients had clinical risks determined to be inter-
mediate  or  high,  whereas  91%  of  patients  had  ScoliScore 
risks  of  low  or  intermediate  ( Table  2 ).  Chi-square  analysis 
comparing ScoliScore and clinical risk distributions ( Table 3 ) 
differed signiﬁ cantly ( P  ⬍ 0.001). The low clinical risk group 
(N   =   2)  had  an  average  ScoliScore  of  77.0.  One  of  these 
patients had a low-risk ScoliScore (17) and the other had an 
intermediate risk ScoliScore (137). The intermediate clinical 
risk  group  (N   =   46)  had  an  average  ScoliScore  of  59.9   ±  
55.9 (1–188). Nearly two-thirds of patients (N  =  28) in this 
group received a low-risk ScoliScore and approximately one-
third of patients (N  =  16) received an intermediate risk Scoli-
Score. Only 2 patients in the intermediate clinical risk group 
had  a  high-risk  ScoliScore.  The  high  clinical  risk  group  (N 
 =  43) had an average ScoliScore of 127.2  ±  51.6 (8–199). 
Only 6 (14%) of these patients also received a high-risk Scoli-
Score level, whereas 33 (76.7%) of these patients fell into the 
intermediate ScoliScore level and 4 (9.3%) were low risk. The 
average ScoliScore of the intermediate clinical risk group was 
signiﬁ cantly  lower  than  that  of  the  high  clinical  risk  group 
( P  ⬍ 0.001). Because of the small sample size of the low clini-
cal risk group (N  =  2), we did not ﬁ nd a signiﬁ cant difference 
between the average ScoliScore of this group and the other 2 
clinical risk groups. Only 25% of patients were in the same 
risk category for both systems.   

  Final Regression Analysis 
 Patients with low-risk ScoliScores had a signiﬁ cantly smaller 
average  Cobb  angle  (15.2 ° )  than  those  with  intermediate 
(20.6 ° ,   P   ⬍  0.001)  and  high  risk  (22.5 ° ,   P   ⬍  0.001)  Scoli-
Scores. ScoliScore demonstrated signiﬁ cant correlation with 
Cobb angle ( r   =  0.581,  P  ⬍ 0.001) and clinical risk category 
( r   =  0.474,  P   ⬍ 0.001). There were no signiﬁ cant associa-

but to our knowledge, no independent group has studied the 
test. We sought to compare ScoliScore risk stratiﬁ cation with 
commonly used clinical risk markers to determine the test’s 
clinical  utility.  Our  results  indicate  that  ScoliScore  provides 
novel clinical data that are unique from the clinical risk esti-
mates commonly utilized in practice. This work advances our 
understanding of the potential role ScoliScore may serve in 
the clinical setting. 

 Risk distribution between the clinical criteria and the Scoli-
Score schema differed markedly. ScoliScore predicted nearly 
16 times more low-risk patients and more than 5 times fewer 
high-risk  patients  than  the  clinical  risk  system.  It  is  these 
groups in which ScoliScore may affect decision making most. 
Nearly 50% of ScoliScores predicted high or low risk of pro-
gression, indicating that the ScoliScore had potential to affect 
decision making in approximately half of our cohort. 

 A strong correlation was found between Cobb angle and 
ScoliScore, and Cobb angle was noted to account for 33.3% 
of ScoliScore variance. This was not unexpected, because the 
Cobb angle is included in the algorithm that generates each 
Scoliscore; however, we found a correlation of this magnitude 
with a dynamic variable surprising for what is marketed as a 
static genetic test. According to the development group, the 
Cobb angle is necessary in order to account for unmeasured 
genetic  and  environmental  factors  that  contribute  to  curve 
progression.  10    Despite  this,  it  is  evident  that  ScoliScore  still 
provided unique clinical information. In addition, no corre-
lations were noted between ScoliScore and any of the other 
studied social or clinical markers. However, our population 
was  fairly  homogenous  in  regard  to  Risser  grade,  sex,  and 
menarcheal status, making it more difﬁ cult to show signiﬁ -
cant differences that may have existed. Some of these clinical 
variables have shown correlations with risk of progression in 
other studies, so a greater diversity in the test population may 
uncover a correlation between these variables and the Scoli-
Score. 

 Interestingly, almost all of the studied patients had either 
intermediate  or  high  clinical  risk  scores.  This  is  because 
ScoliScore testing is most frequently offered to young, skel-
etally immature patients, most of whom were Risser grade 
0.  Based  on  the  Lonstein  risk  of  progression  table,  2    Risser 
grade 0 patients can be classiﬁ ed only as intermediate or high 

risk. Therefore, this method of risk prediction tends to lump 
younger patients rather than stratify them. Hence, it is in this 
younger  population  where  the  ScoliScore  may  provide  the 
most meaningful data, as it does stratify this group. In fact, 
the great majority of patients with a high clinical risk were 
classiﬁ ed as intermediate or low risk by ScoliScore. In prac-
tice, our institution sees a large number of skeletally imma-
ture patients with small curves, among whom it is difﬁ cult to 
determine who is likely to progress. The ability of the Scoli-
Score  to  more  accurately  risk  stratify  these  patients  would 
allow clinicians to lengthen the time conﬁ dently and appro-
priately between follow-up visits in some and watch others 
more closely. 

 In  the  data  presented  from  the  initial  development  and 
validation  of  ScoliScore,  52%  to  64%  of  screened  patients 
with mild scoliosis had ScoliScores of 40 and below.  10   Only 
36.3% of our cohort fell within the low-risk ScoliScore cat-
egory and only 27.5% of our cohort returned scores of less 
than 40. This may be related to the differences in the studied 
populations, because our study was conducted at a tertiary 
care referral center for scoliosis with an inherently higher risk 
population than the school screening or purely pediatrician 
referral-based  population  used  in  the  initial  test  validation. 
However, such differences in patient score distributions under 
real testing conditions suggest the potential for limited util-
ity in some practices; if the majority of ScoliScores return as 
intermediate  and  thus  clinically  indeterminate,  physicians 
may opt to abandon the test because of an unfavorable cost/
beneﬁ t ratio. Further work in larger cohorts of patients will 
be necessary to clarify these differences from the expected dis-
tribution of patient scores. 

 Although our data demonstrate a difference in the informa-
tion obtained from clinical risk factors and the ScoliScore, it is 
still unclear whether this “different” information is accurate 
in its risk stratiﬁ cation of patients. Although the test’s valida-
tion work demonstrated an excellent negative predictive value 
of low ScoliScores, further work is needed to determine the 
validity of the test’s progression predictions in an independent 
cohort under real clinical conditions.  10   

 One  potential  criticism  of  this  study  is  the  inclusion  of  8 
patients not fully categorizing as Caucasian. According to the 
manufacturer, ScoliScore testing is currently indicated only in 
self-reported  Caucasian  males  and  females,  including  North 
and South American, European, Eastern European, and Mid-
dle Eastern. These recommendations are based on the test’s val-
idation data having insufﬁ cient samples of other races to deter-
mine the validity of the test in those groups, noting speciﬁ cally 
the black and Hispanic cohorts.  10   Such group distinctions can 
be vague particularly given the considerable heterogeneity of 
the “Hispanic” population. In addition, Hispanic is an ethnic 
distinction and not a racial grouping like Caucasian, and thus 
there exists considerable overlap between the 2. For this rea-
son, we elected to include white-Hispanic patients (3 patients) 
and 50% or more of Caucasian descent patients (5 patients). 
Furthermore, because our study does not assess the validity of 
the ScoliScore predictions but rather discusses our experience

to date with the test, inclusion of these patients should not sig-
niﬁ cantly impact the reported outcomes. They are also likely 
more reﬂ ective of how the test will be used in a real population, 
given the ambiguity of the test indications. 

 In this study, the 2 stratiﬁ cation systems used different deﬁ -
nitions of progression, which could be perceived as a weak-
ness. Lonstein’s article deﬁ ned progression as a Cobb angle 
increase of 5 °  to 10 °  beyond the measurement made at the 
time of diagnosis, whereas ScoliScore measures the risk that 
the curve will progress to 40 °  by skeletal maturity. However, 
we think that these different deﬁ nitions of progression do not 
matter, because it is the perception of risk (high or low) that 
drives  the  physician’s  management  decisions  and  patient’s 
anxiety more so than the speciﬁ c deﬁ nition of that risk. We 
think  this  is  especially  true  for  younger  children  diagnosed 
with scoliosis who will automatically be placed into a clinical 
high-risk group because of their skeletal immaturity. 

 Sanders  et al   11   recently described a simpliﬁ ed version of the 
Tanner-Whitehouse III classiﬁ cation of hand bone age stud-
ies, which categorizes patients into 8 stages of growth.  11   This 
method  provides  a  more  accurate  assessment  of  remaining 
growth than the Lonstein staging because most patients have 
ﬁ nished their peak growth velocity by the time they are Risser 
grade 1. If this staging had been used to classify clinical risk 
instead of the Lonstein classiﬁ cation, our ﬁ ndings might have 
demonstrated a different clinical risk stratiﬁ cation. However, 
many of our patients did not have a hand radiograph from the 
day of their ScoliScore, and it was not possible to include this 
in our analysis. Because of the ease of interpretation afforded 
by Sanders  et al ,  11   hand bone age is becoming more widely 
used at our institution to assess remaining growth potential, 
and its increased use will make its inclusion as a clinical risk 
predictor possible for future studies. 

 In conclusion, ScoliScore risk stratiﬁ cation differed mark-
edly from traditional clinical estimates in patients tested at 
our  institution,  suggesting  that  ScoliScore  provides  addi-
tional information unable to be measured from radiographs 
and  physical  examination  alone.  Continued  efforts  are 
needed  to  justify  the  use  of  this  test  by  following  an  inde-
pendent  cohort  of  tested  patients  to  determine  the  clinical 
validity  of  ScoliScore’s  risk  predictions.  This  validation  is 
going to be particularly important for the high-risk group for
