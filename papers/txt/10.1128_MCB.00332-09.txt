Meningiomas, one of the most common human brain tumors, are derived from arachnoidal cells associated
with brain meninges, are usually benign, and are frequently associated with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2. Here, we
deﬁne a typical human meningioma microRNA (miRNA) proﬁle and characterize the effects of one downregu-
lated miRNA, miR-200a, on tumor growth. Elevated levels of miR-200a inhibited meningioma cell growth in
culture and in a tumor model in vivo. Upregulation of miR-200a decreased the expression of transcription
factors ZEB1 and SIP1, with consequent increased expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion protein associated
with cell differentiation. Downregulation of miR-200a in meningiomas and arachnoidal cells resulted in
increased expression of ␤-catenin and cyclin D1 involved in cell proliferation. miR-200a was found to directly
target ␤-catenin mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation and blocking Wnt/␤-catenin signaling, which is
frequently involved in cancer. A direct correlation was found between the downregulation of miR-200a and the
upregulation of ␤-catenin in human meningioma samples. Thus, miR-200a appears to act as a multifunctional
tumor suppressor miRNA in meningiomas through effects on the E-cadherin and Wnt/␤-catenin signaling
pathways. This reveals a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involved in meningioma tumor develop-
ment and highlights a novel molecular interaction between miR-200a and Wnt signaling, thereby providing
insights into novel therapies for meningiomas.

Meningiomas are among the most frequent tumors of the
brain and spinal cord, accounting for 15% to 20% of all central
nervous system tumors (19). One of the most common events
associated with meningioma tumorigenesis is deletion in chro-
mosome 22q associated with loss of the neuroﬁbromatosis 2
(NF2) gene (11, 25). The NF2-encoded protein, merlin (schwan-
nomin), is structurally related to ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins,
which link the actin cytoskeleton to speciﬁc proteins in the
plasma membrane (36, 42). Merlin has distinct properties and
functions in regulating cell growth and proliferation in ways
that are not ascribed to the ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins (42).
Some other genes have also been shown to be mutated in
meningiomas, such as TP53, PTEN, and KRAS (17). Additional
genetic events in meningiomas include chromosomal deletions

17q, and 20q (22, 39, 45).

Recent studies analyzing microRNA (miRNA) proﬁles and
functions in cancer have provided valuable information about
the molecular pathogenesis of several tumor types, including
glioblastoma (6), hepatocellular carcinoma (24), and breast
(23, 44), lung, colon, and prostate cancer (44). miRNAs are
a family of small (⬃22-nucleotide), endogenous, noncoding
RNAs processed from double-stranded hairpin precursors (1,
18). They inhibit the expression of target mRNAs by binding to
complementary sequences in untranslated regions (UTR) of
mRNAs (typically the 3⬘ UTR) and repressing translation
and/or cleaving the mRNA (1, 18). miRNA genes are included
in the genome and transcribed by RNA polymerase II into
longer transcripts, referred to as primary transcripts, or pri-
miRNAs, and then processed into precursor miRNAs, or pre-
miRNAs (10). So far, 800 different miRNAs, predicted by
computational scanning in the human genome, have been doc-
umented (miRBase 10.0 [http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk]).

Reduction in cadherins and activation of the Wnt/␤-catenin
signaling pathway are key components of many types of cancer.
Previous studies have shown that members of the miR-200

family inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an
initial step in tumorigenesis, by direct targeting of mRNAs for
ZEB1 and SIP1, which negatively regulate expression of the
E-cadherin gene (4, 12, 20, 32). Thus, downregulation of
miR-200 family members promotes EMT as an initial step in
tumorigenesis by increasing levels of ZEB1 and SIP1 and
thereby decreasing E-cadherin expression. ␤-Catenin binds di-
rectly to cadherin, which serves as a “sink” to restrict the
movement of this transcriptional factor into the nucleus in
response to Wnt signaling (29). Wnt signaling leads to trans-
location of ␤-catenin into the nucleus with activation of re-
sponsive target genes involved in stimulation of the cell cycle
and inhibition of apoptosis, such as cyclin D1 and MDR1/PGP,
respectively (13).

Although there has been considerable effort to reveal mo-
lecular events involved in the development of meningiomas,
there has been no report, to our knowledge, on the miRNA
signatures of meningiomas. In this study, we carried out a
genome-wide array screen comparing miRNA levels in 14 spo-
radic benign human meningioma tumors (WHO grade I) with
three normal arachnoidal tissue samples (cells of origin). miR-
200a was among the most downregulated miRNAs in menin-
giomas by approximately 25-fold. The chromosomal region
1p36, including miR-200a, was found to be deleted in 3 of 14
meningioma tumor samples. We further investigated the func-
tional consequences of miR-200a downregulation in meningi-
omas and showed that overexpression of miR-200a inhibited
meningioma cell growth both in culture and in a xenograft
tumor model in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of miR-200a
decreased the expression of transcription factors ZEB1 and
SIP1 and resulted in increased E-cadherin expression. The
Wnt signaling pathway was inhibited by direct targeting of
␤-catenin message by miR-200a, with elevated miR-200a lead-
ing to decreased levels of ␤-catenin. A signiﬁcant correlation
was found between miR-200a downregulation and ␤-catenin
upregulation in meningioma tumor samples compared to
arachnoidal control tissues. Taken together, our ﬁndings sup-
port an important role for reduced miR-200a levels in menin-
gioma tumorigenesis through upregulation of E-cadherin ex-
pression and downregulation of the major activator of the Wnt
signaling pathway, ␤-catenin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor and normal tissue samples. Meningioma samples were obtained from
discarded tumor tissue at the time of surgery, and normal arachnoid tissue was
obtained from autopsies within 5 t o 7 h ofdeath. All human tissues were
collected and deidentiﬁed by the Neuro-Oncology Tumor Repository, snap-
frozen, and stored at ⫺80°C under Institutional Review Board protocols ap-
proved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Committee on Human Research.
Cell lines. Human meningioma cell lines, SF4068 and SF4433, were estab-
lished from benign meningioma tumors that did not have the NF2 gene deleted
(kindly provided by Anita Lal, University of California, San Francisco) (9). These
meningioma cells were immortalized by transduction with expression cassettes
for human telomerase and papillomavirus E6/E7 (9). We stably transduced these
cells with lentivirus vectors encoding expression cassettes for Gaussia luciferase
(Gluc) or ﬁreﬂy luciferase (Fluc) (2). HEK 293T cells (obtained from Maria
Calos, Stanford University), human skin ﬁbroblasts (L2131; obtained from Chris-
tine Klein, Luebeck, Germany), and meningioma cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine se-
rum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 ␮g/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Primary human arachnoidal cells were cultured in “improved” minimal essential
medium with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mg/liter insulin, and penicillin-strepto-
mycin (4 mg/liter) (15).

a Global miRNA expression proﬁles of benign meningiomas were compared with
arachnoidal tissue controls. miRNA screening was performed in triplicate for 14
tumor and 3 control samples using an array with radioactive probes as described in
Materials and Methods. A two-tailed, two-sample t test was used with differences of
two-fold or greater between samples (P ⬍ 0.05) regarded as signiﬁcant. Forty-three
miRNAs were found to be signiﬁcantly dysregulated in most (9 to 13/14) meningi-
oma samples compared to the means for control tissues.

miRNA overexpression and inhibition. Precursor and inhibitor miRNAs were
as follows: precursor-miR-200a (pre-miR-200a) (Ambion, Foster City, CA;
AM17100), Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR negative control 1 (Ambion; AM17120),
pre-miR negative control 1 (Ambion; AM17110), anti-miRNA inhibitor negative
control 1 (Ambion; AM17010), Cy3 dye-labeled anti-miR negative control 1
(Ambion; AM17011), and anti-miR-200a (Ambion; AM10991). miRNA precur-
sors or inhibitors (both at 50 nM) were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The transfection efﬁciency was 99% in all cells
used in this study, as determined by transfection of Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides
and ﬂuorescence microscopy (data not shown).

Expression vectors. pLenti-TOPFLASH (26) and pHGC-hRluc (40) plasmids
were provided by Jean Wang and Bakhos A. Tannous, respectively. The Lenti-
TOPFLASH vector was packaged using the “trans-lentiviral packaging system”

FIG. 1. Validation of miRNA levels in meningiomas by qRT-PCR. (A) We performed multiplex RT-PCRs in order to quantitate dysregulated
miRNAs using three control and three randomly selected meningioma samples (XT3731, XT3871, and XT3771). Twenty miRNAs were validated
as being signiﬁcantly (P ⬍ 0.05) dysregulated, shown as the mean ⫾ SD relative to the control mean. (B) qRT-PCRs were performed on RNAs
isolated from two meningioma cell lines, and the endogenous miR-200a levels of these cells were compared to those of arachnoidal controls.
(C) Meningioma cells (SF4433) were left untransfected or transfected with pre-control 1 or different concentrations of pre-miR-200a. Two days
after transfection, RNA was isolated and miR-200a levels were measured by qRT-PCR. The data in all panels were normalized to the levels of
U6 RNA in each sample. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the values are expressed as means ⫾ SD (*, P ⬍ 0.02; **, P ⬍ 0.0001).

(Open Biosystem, Huntsville, AL). An adenovirus-based expression cassette for
␤-catenin under the cytomegalovirus promoter, Ad-␤-catenin, was purchased
from Vector BioLabs (Philadelphia, PA).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and apoptosis assays. SF4433 cells
were seeded into 12-well plates (1 ⫻ 105 cells per well) and transfected the next
day with precursor miRNAs. Five hours later, 10,000 cells were seeded in each
well of a six-well plate. After days 1, 2, and 3, the cells were ﬁxed with 70%
ethanol on ice for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
treated with RNase A (100 ␮g/ml) at 37°C for 30 min and then with 20 ␮g/ml
propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). A total of 10,000 stained nuclei were
analyzed in a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA)
using BD-CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). DNA histograms were ana-
lyzed using WinMDI 2.8 software (Purdue University Cytometry Laboratories,
West Lafayette, IN). Apoptotic cell death was determined using the Caspase-Glo
3/7 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions.

Meningioma cell implantation and bioluminescence imaging. Transfection of
the meningioma cell line SF4433-Fluc with miRNAs was performed as described
above. Five hours later, the cells were trypsinized, rinsed, and subcutaneously
implanted (2 ⫻ 105 cells in 100 ␮l Matrigel per ﬂank) in both ﬂanks of athymic
mice (nu/nu; 5-week-old females; Massachusetts General Hospital breeding fa-
cility). To visualize tumors, the animals were ﬁrst anesthetized with ketamine
(Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) and xylazine (Lloyd, Shenandoah, IA) and then
injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (150 ␮g/g body wt; GoldBio Technol-
ogy, St. Louis, MO) (40). Ten minutes after the injection of D-luciferin, images
were acquired for 1 min using a charge-coupled-device camera (Roper Scientiﬁc,
Trenton, NJ) and quantiﬁed with Living Image analysis software (IDL Research
Systems, Boulder, CO). All animal procedures were performed according to

guidelines issued by the Committee of Animal Care of Massachusetts General
Hospital.

TOPFLASH reporter gene assay. To measure TOPFLASH activity, meningi-
oma cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Twenty-four
hours later, the cells were infected with the Lenti-TOPFLASH vector or trans-
fected with pre-miR-200a, anti-miR200a, control precursor, or anti-miRNAs
using Lipofectamine. To monitor transfection efﬁciency, an expression cassette
for Renilla luciferase (Rluc) (see above) was cotransfected. Five hours later,
mWnt3a (50 ng/ml) was added. The cells were treated for 3 days before being
harvested. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual luciferase reporter
100 assay system (Promega). Fluc activity was normalized to Rluc activity using
the same kit.

Western blot analysis. Meningioma cells were seeded into 10-cm-diameter
tissue culture plates (4 ⫻ 106 cells per plate) and transfected the following day
with pre-miR-200a or precontrol 1 or left untransfected, or were infected with
Ad-␤-catenin vector. After 3 days, the cells were harvested and total protein was
separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-8% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto
nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at37°C and then rinsed once with PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 and washed twice for 15 min and twice for 5 min at
room temperature with TBS-T (37). The primary antibodies used were for
E-cadherin (1/1,000; BD Bioscience; no. 610182), ␤-catenin (1/200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; sc-59737), ZEB1 (1/100; Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology; sc-25388), SIP1 (1/200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-18392), and ␤-actin
(1/5,000; Sigma; A5356). ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunny-
vale, CA) was used to quantify the bands of the Western blots. The intensities
were normalized to anti-␤-actin levels and depicted as relative intensities.

FIG. 2. Increased miR-200a inhibits meningioma cell growth. Meningioma cell lines, SF4433-Gluc (A and C) and SF4068-Gluc (B and D), were
transfected with either pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1 or left untransfected and seeded in six-well plates 5 h after transfection. (A and B) Cells were
counted on subsequent days after transfection. (C and D) In a parallel experiment, Gluc activity in the media of the cells was measured as relative
light units (RLU) to provide a second growth parameter (**, P ⬍ 0.001; ***, P ⬍ 0.0001).

Growth rate. Meningioma cell lines, SF4433 and SF4068; primary arachnoidal
cells, AC030 (5 ⫻ 103); and human skin ﬁbroblasts, L2131 (1 ⫻ 105) were seeded
in each well of a 24-well plate and transfected the following day with either
precursor miRNAs, control miRNAs, pre-control 1 (50 nM, Ambion), or small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for E-cadherin or left untransfected or were infected
with Ad-␤-catenin vector, in various combinations. Five hours later, cells were
transferred to each well of a six-well plate in growth medium. The cells were
counted on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 using a hemocytometer. siRNAs directed against
E-cadherin (sc-44222) and ␤-catenin (sc-59737) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.

Luciferase activity. Meningioma cells stably expressing Gluc were transfected
with precursor miRNAs, as described above, and 10 ␮l conditioned medium was
removed at the indicated time points, mixed with 100 ␮l luciferase assay solution
(Promega), and analyzed in a luminometer (2).

miRNA arrays. Total RNA was isolated from tissues with Trizol (Invitrogen).
RNA labeling and hybridization on a microarray were performed as previously
described (21, 27). Brieﬂy, 10 ␮g total RNA from each sample was ﬁltered
through Microcon YM-100 concentrators to obtain a low-molecular-weight frac-
tion of RNA enriched in molecules under 60 bp. The low-molecular-weight RNA
was end labeled with 30 ␮Ci y33-P dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide
kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and puriﬁed using the Qiagen
(Valencia, CA) nucleotide removal kit. For hybridization, membranes were ﬁrst
prehybridized in MicroHyb Hybridization Buffer (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min,
followed by overnight hybridization in the same solution containing RNA probes.
Following hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to a phosphor
storage screen and scanned using a phosphorimager (Massachusetts General
Hospital core facility), and the hybridization signals were quantiﬁed using Im-
ageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). RNA samples were considered inde-
pendent measurements for the purposes of the two-tailed, two-sample t test.
Probe signals that showed high variance in biological replicates (more than
twofold with P values of ⬎0.05) were excluded from further analysis.

miRNA array data were ﬁrst normalized using the median-centric method
within BRBArrayTools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) and were
further subjected to quantile normalization. Differentiated miRNA lists compar-
ing expression in the control to that in all meningioma samples for miRNA arrays
were generated using the signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays method (43) with
cutoffs at a false discovery rate of ⬍30% and a P value of ⬍0.05. The normalized
array data for the derived differentiated miRNA list were then transformed to z

scores for data of each miRNA across samples using the WPS utility program
(46), which was subjected to heat map clustering analysis and visualization using
the TM4 program from The Institute for Genomic Research (http://www.tm4
.org/).

qRT-PCR. Analysis was used to determine the relative expression levels of
miRNAs. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of
RNA were converted into cDNAs using reverse transcription (RT) primers
(Ambion). Subsequently, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed us-
ing primers and materials from Ambion. The threshold cycle values were used to
calculate the relative difference in miRNA levels. U6 RNA was used as an
internal control in these RT-PCRs. For mRNA analysis, cDNA was randomly
primed from 1.0 ␮g of total RNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). qRT-
PCR was subsequently performed in triplicate. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phos-
phate dehydrogenase) mRNA was used to normalize all mRNA quantiﬁcations,
as described previously (12).

Array CGH. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed
using Agilent cDNA arrays and oligonucleotide arrays as previously described
(31, 38). Control DNA (male and female) from healthy individuals was used for
comparison. Tumor DNA was extracted from frozen tissues from the Neuro-
Oncology Tumor Repository (Massachusetts General Hospital).

Luciferase miRNA target reporter assay. pMiR-Report Fluc vectors (Ambion)
were used to introduce the portion of the 3⬘ UTR of ␤-catenin mRNA containing
the putative binding site for miR-200a. DNA oligonucleotide templates were
synthesized (Invitrogen) as 63-mer sense and antisense oligonucleotide tem-
plates and annealed, as described previously (7). The annealed oligonucleo-
tides were digested and ligated at HindIII and SpeI sites in pMiR-Report.
The oligonucleotides used in these studies were as follows: ␤-catenin-wt

FIG. 3. Effects of decreased miR-200a on the growth of different cell types. miRNA transfection and cell growth experiments similar to those
for Fig. 2 were performed, except in this case an antisense oligonucleotide for miR-200a and a control antisense were used. The effect of miR-200a
downregulation on the growth of meningioma cells, SF4433 (A and B); primary human arachnoidal cells, AC030-Gluc (C and D); and primary
human skin ﬁbroblasts, L213-Gluc (E and F), are shown as cell counts and secreted luciferase activity (in relative light units [RLU]). Primary
arachnoidal cells and ﬁbroblasts were infected with the Gluc lentivirus vector (90%) prior to the assay. The experiments were performed in
triplicate, and the values are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD (*, P ⬍ 0.05).

was cotransfected and used to normalize the Fluc values expressed by the pMiR-
Report constructs.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining. Cells grown on coverslips were ﬁxed in meth-
anol for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X in
1⫻ PBS at room temperature for 15 min. After being blocked in PBS supple-
mented with 3% low-fat milk (blocking solution) and 0.2% Triton-X, coverslips
were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies to ␤-catenin (Santa-
Cruz mouse monoclonal antibody, catalog no. sc-5973; 1:50 dilution) and E-
cadherin (Cell Signaling rabbit, catalog no. 4068; 1:50 dilution). All antibodies
were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.2% Triton-X in 1⫻ PBS. After
being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated
goat anti-mouse (for ␤-catenin) and donkey anti-rabbit (for E-cadherin) (both
from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; diluted 1:500) for 45 min at 37°C. The
nuclei were then counterstained with DAPI (4⬘,6⬘-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
(0.1 ␮g/ml; Sigma) for 10 min, washed with water, and mounted in Vector
Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI. Images were captured with a Nikon
Eclipse TE2000-U ﬂuorescence microscope.

Statistical analysis. All measurements, including cell counting, luciferase mea-
surement, and qRT-PCR, were performed in triplicate, and the values are ex-
pressed as the mean ⫾ standard deviation (SD); P values were calculated by
using Student’s t test, and P values of ⬍0.05 were regarded as signiﬁcant. Pearson
correlation coefﬁcients were calculated as a measurement for the association
level of expression of miR-200a with ␤-catenin, cyclin D1, and E-cadherin from
three independent experiments, and the P value was derived from computing a
test of the correlation coefﬁcient being zero. Regression lines were derived for
each set of data to show the trend of correlation. All the analyses were done
using R language (http://www.r-project.org/).

Microarray data accession number. The microarray data set has been depos-
ited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
with the accession no. GSE17792.

RESULTS

miRNA proﬁling reveals a set of dysregulated miRNAs in
meningiomas. In order to investigate the possible role(s) of
miRNAs in meningioma tumor development and progression,
we performed radioactive miRNA array screening using an
array that could detect 407 known miRNAs (21, 27) and ana-
lyzed 14 human sporadic benign meningiomas, WHO grade I,
half of which had the NF2 locus deleted and half of which did
not, as determined by CGH, as well as three normal control
arachnoidal tissue samples (from fresh autopsies). WHO grade
I meningiomas are by far the most common type of meningi-
omas, representing an initial stage in tumor development, and
as such, the normal arachnoidal tissue of origin was deemed
the best control to look for changes in miRNAs related to
tumorigenesis. We found 43 dysregulated miRNAs in most
meningioma tumor samples (in 9 to 13 out of 14 tumors)
independent of the NF2 status (Table 1). Twenty of these
changes in miRNA levels were conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR, with
17 upregulated and 3 downregulated in two independent assays
(Fig. 1A) in a comparison of three randomly selected menin-
gioma samples and three arachnoidal tissue control samples.
Of the overexpressed miRNAs, miR-335, miR-98, and miR-
181a were the most upregulated (25- to 30-fold). Additional
miRNAs conﬁrmed to be upregulated (4- to 10-fold) in the
qRT-PCR were miR-19b, let7d, let7g, miR-100, miR-125a,

FIG. 4. miR-200a triggers apoptosis in meningioma cells and inhibits meningioma tumor growth in vivo. (A) Cell cycle analysis of meningioma
cells using propidium iodide (PI) labeling and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of DNA content was performed 1, 2, and 3 days after
transfection with either pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1 or no transfection. (B) In a separate experiment, transfection was performed as for panel
A, and the Caspase-Glo 3/7 (Promega) assay was carried out on cell lysates 3 days after transfection, with the result expressed as relative light units
(RLU). Data are shown as the mean ⫾ SD (*, P ⬍ 0.002; **, P ⬍ 0.005). (C) SF4433-Fluc cells were transfected with either pre-miR-200a or
pre-control 1 or left untransfected and then implanted subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of 5-week-old female athymic mice (nu/nu) 5 h later (eight
mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging using a charge-coupled-device camera. Relative luciferase
activity is shown as the mean ⫾ SD (*, P ⬍ 0.004). (D) Representative bioluminescence images of three mice are shown with a pseudocolor bar
to indicate the degrees of bioluminescence.

let7b,
miR-103, miR-370, miR-106b, miR-106a, miR-125b,
miR-26a, miR-23b, and miR-29a. All three downregulated
miRNAs showed marked decreases: miR-200a, 25-fold; miR-
373*, 12-fold; and miR-575, 10-fold. These data revealed a set
of dysregulated miRNAs common to most sporadic benign
meningiomas, providing a typical meningioma miRNA proﬁle.
miR-200a inhibits meningioma cell growth in culture. Among
several interesting dysregulated miRNAs, we focused on miR-
200a, which was downregulated in 10 of 14 meningiomas. We
initially employed a gain-of-function approach to investigate
the possible role of miR-200a in the growth of meningioma
cells using human meningioma cell lines, SF4433-Gluc and
SF4068-Gluc (9). SF4433-Gluc cells had about threefold lower
levels of miR-200a and SF4068-Gluc cells had approximately
50% lower levels than primary arachnoidal cells (Fig. 1B). In

order to increase the levels of miR-200a, these cells were
transfected with a precursor for miR-200a (pre-miR-200a;
Ambion) and compared with cells transfected with a control
precursor (pre-control 1; Ambion) or untransfected cells. The
transfection efﬁciencies were 99% in both cell lines, as deter-
mined by transfection of pre-control 1–Cy3 (Ambion) and ﬂu-
orescence microscopy (data not shown). Two days after the
transfection of 50 nM pre-miR-200a, signiﬁcant overexpression
of miR-200a was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Five hours
after the transfection of meningioma cells, they were replated,
and cell counts were determined 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 days later (Fig.
2). The growth of SF4433 and SF4068 cells was signiﬁcantly
reduced, by about 65% and 50%, respectively, on day 6 after
transfection with pre-miR-200a compared with control cells
(Fig. 2A and B). In parallel experiments, these cell lines were

FIG. 5. Effects of elevated miR-200a on other proteins. (A) Meningioma cells, SF4433, transfected with either pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1
or left untransfected, were harvested 2 days later, and Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies to ZEB1, SIP1, E-cadherin, ␤-catenin,
and ␤-actin. The relative blot intensities were quantiﬁed by image analysis, with densitometry values normalized to ␤-actin and untransfected values
set at 1.0. (B) In a parallel experiment, total RNA was extracted from transfected cells, as described above. qRT-PCRs were performed for ZEB1,
SIP1, E-cadherin, ␤-catenin, and GAPDH mRNAs. The data were normalized to GAPDH in each sample. The results are shown as the mean ⫾

also transduced with an expression cassette for the Gluc gene
to monitor cell growth by measurement of luciferase activity
secreted into the medium (2). As predicted, we also observed
a pronounced reduction of luciferase activity for both menin-
gioma lines transfected with pre-miR-200a over time (Fig. 2C
and D). The inhibitory effect of pre-miR-200a on meningioma
cell growth appeared to be speciﬁc for this miRNA, as trans-
fection with an miRNA precursor for miR-575, which was also
downregulated in meningiomas, did not affect the growth of
SF4433-Gluc cells (data not shown). Interestingly, down-
regulation of miR-200a by an miR-200a-speciﬁc inhibitor,
anti-miR-200a, signiﬁcantly increased the growth of menin-
gioma cells, by approximately 25%, compared to the controls
(Fig. 3A and B). However, the growth of primary human skin
ﬁbroblasts (L2131-Gluc) and arachnoidal cells (AC030-Gluc)
was not affected (Fig. 3C to F). Taken together, our data
support the ability of increased levels of miR-200a to inhibit
the growth of meningioma cells in culture, consistent with the
hypothesis that decreased levels of miR-200a support menin-
gioma tumor growth. However, decreased levels of miR-200a
alone were not sufﬁcient to promote the proliferation of arach-
noidal cells.

miR-200a triggers apoptosis in meningioma cells and inhib-
its meningioma tumor growth in vivo. Cell cycle analysis was
carried out to investigate the mechanism of the cell growth
deﬁciency in the pre-miR-200a-transfected meningioma cells.
SF4433 cells were transfected with pre-miR-200a or pre-con-
trol 1 or left untransfected. Cells were harvested 24, 48, and
72 h later and then ﬁxed and labeled with propidium iodide for

ﬂow cytometric analysis. A gradual temporal increase in the
fraction of cells in the sub-G1 phase, corresponding to the
apoptotic cell death population, was observed only in cells
transfected with pre-miR-200a (Fig. 4A). By 72 h after trans-
fection, approximately 27% of the pre-miR-200a-transfected
cells were in the sub-G1 fraction compared to 5.7% of pre-
control 1-transfected cells and 5.5% of untreated cells. Apop-
tosis was also monitored by caspase 3 and 7 activities in trans-
fected and nontransfected cells as a component of cell death
that could account for the reduced meningioma cell numbers
seen in Fig. 2. Seventy-two hours post-pre-miR-200a transfec-
tion, SF4433 cells showed two to four times more caspase 3/7
activity than the controls (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the
reduced growth of meningioma cells due to elevated miR-200a
is a result of apoptosis.

The strong growth-inhibitory effect of pre-miR-200a on me-
ningioma cells in culture was then tested on tumor growth in
vivo. Meningioma cells stably expressing Fluc (SF4433-Fluc)
were transfected with either pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1 or
left untransfected and 5 h later were implanted subcutaneously
into both ﬂanks of nude mice (1 ⫻ 105 cells per injection site;
eight mice per group). Subsequent tumor growth was moni-
tored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging over 17 days (Fig.
4C). Almost all the tumors formed by meningioma cells trans-
fected with pre-miR-200a failed to grow, with a marked reduc-
tion in size from days 3 to 17 postimplantation, while control
tumors grew slowly during this period. Representative biolu-
minescence images of these mice are shown in Fig. 4D. In
control groups, in vivo imaging was terminated 3 weeks after

FIG. 6. Role of E-cadherin in miR-200a growth inhibition of meningioma cells. (A) Meningioma cells, SF4433, were transfected with
siRNA–E-cadherin or control siRNA or left untransfected, and 3 days later, qRT-PCRs were performed for E-cadherin mRNA and normalized
to GAPDH mRNA levels. (B) Meningioma cells were cotransfected with siRNA–E-cadherin and pre-miR-200a or with control siRNA or
pre-control 1, in various combinations, or left untransfected, and 5 h later, the cells were replated in six-well plates. The cells were counted at daily
intervals after transfection. The results are shown as the mean ⫾ SD (*, P ⬍ 0.05; ***, P ⬍ 0.0001).

implantation due to the excessive size of tumors. Out of the 16
miR-200a-treated tumors, only 2 grew over an 8-week period,
and they manifested levels of luciferase activity comparable to
those of the control groups at the 3-week time of sacriﬁce (data
not shown). qRT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from tumors
at the time of sacriﬁce showed no difference between the levels
of miR-200a in pre-miR-200a, pre-control 1, or untreated tu-
mors (data not shown), as presumably transfected precursor
and derived mature miR-200a species were diluted out with
tumor cell division. This ﬁnding indicates that elevated miR-
200a levels in meningioma cells markedly reduce their ability
to form tumors.

miR-200a leads to E-cadherin upregulation and directly tar-
gets ␤-catenin mRNA. In the light of ﬁndings by others that
ZEB1 and SIP1 mRNAs are direct targets for miR-200a and
regulate E-cadherin expression (4, 12, 20, 32), we tested the
effects of miR-200a elevation on the levels of protein and
mRNA for these transcription factors in meningioma cells.
Meningioma cells were transfected with pre-miR-200a or pre-
control 1 or left untransfected, and 3 days later, Western blot
analysis was performed on cell lysates using ZEB1, SIP1, and
E-cadherin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, miR-200a over-
expression reduced ZEB1 and SIP1 protein levels, while E-

cadherin protein levels were increased. In the same experimen-
tal paradigm, qRT-PCR showed that ZEB1 and SIP1 mRNAs
were reduced, whereas E-cadherin mRNA was increased by
overexpression of miR-200a (Fig. 5B).

We also examined whether another member of the miR-200
family, miR-200b, can affect ␤-catenin expression. We used
both meningioma and primary arachnoidal cells and trans-
fected meningioma cells with pre-miR-200b and primary
arachnoidal cells with anti-miR-200b. Three days later,
Western blot analysis was performed with anti-␤-catenin
and anti-actin antibodies. We found that neither overexpres-
sion of pre-miR-200b in meningioma cells nor downregula-
tion of miR-200b in arachnoidal cells altered the levels of
␤-catenin (data not shown). This lack of effect is supported by
a search of computationally predicted target sequences in
mRNAs that showed that ␤-catenin mRNA is not among the
predicted targets of miR-200b (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/cgi
-bin/PicTar_vertebrate.cgi).

Based on studies showing the interaction between ␤-catenin
and cadherin, as well as the role of ␤-catenin in the Wnt
signaling pathway, we also tested whether miR-200a levels
affected ␤-catenin expression. Interestingly, we found that in-
creased levels of miR-200a in meningioma cells signiﬁcantly

potential binding site in the 3⬘ UTR of the human ␤-catenin mRNA. (B) pMiR-Report vectors containing the wt or mt miR-200a binding site from
the 3⬘ UTR of ␤-catenin mRNA and pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1, as well as an expression cassette for Rluc, were cotransfected into HEK 293T
cells. Two days later, Fluc activity in the cells was measured and normalized to Rluc activity. (C and D) SF4433 (C) or SF4068 (D) cells were left
untransfected, transfected with pre-miR-200a or pre-control 1, or infected with Ad-␤-catenin vector and seeded in six-well plates 5 h after
transfection. The cells were counted at daily intervals after being plated. (E and F) In a parallel experiment to those shown in panels C and D,
␤-catenin, ZEB1, and SIP1 protein levels were monitored in SF4433 (E) and SF4068 (F) cells by Western blot analysis, normalized to ␤-actin levels,
and compared to those of untransfected cells, set at 1.0. (G) SF4433 cells were ﬁrst infected with the Lenti-TOPFLASH vector and then transfected
with an expression cassette for Rluc, after which some cells were also transfected with pre-control 1, pre-miR-200a, control antisense inhibitor, or
anti-miR-200a. Five hours later, the cells were incubated in normal growth medium or medium supplemented with mWnt3 (underlined). Fluc
activity was measured 2 days after transfection, normalized to Rluc activity, and expressed as changes in relative light units relative to the level in
untransfected cells in normal medium. The results are shown as means ⫾ SD (**, P ⬍ 0.001; ***, P ⬍ 0.0001).

downregulated ␤-catenin at both mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 5A and B). Thus, we hypothesized that miR-200a might
inhibit meningioma tumor growth both by upregulating E-
cadherin expression and by decreasing Wnt/␤-catenin signal-
ing. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst examined the involvement
of E-cadherin upregulation in miR-200a-mediated growth in-
hibition of meningioma cells. Meningioma cells transfected
with an siRNA for E-cadherin mRNA showed a decrease in
E-cadherin mRNA levels (Fig. 6A). Cells were then trans-
fected with an siRNA for E-cadherin mRNA or pre-miR-200a

alone or cotransfected with both or with control constructs; 5 h
later, the cells were replated, and cell counts were determined
after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days (Fig. 6B). siRNA reduction of
E-cadherin levels alone did not signiﬁcantly increase the
growth of meningioma cells, while as previously observed (Fig.
2), miR-200a overexpression reduced cell growth by approxi-
mately 65% compared to untransfected cells. When siRNAs
for E-cadherin mRNA and pre-miR-200a were cotransfected,
the growth of meningioma cells was reduced by only about
50%, indicating that while miR-200a probably regulates the

FIG. 8. Reduction in ␤-catenin expression by siRNA inhibits meningioma cell growth in culture. (A and B) Transfection of siRNAs directed
against ␤-catenin and controls and a meningioma cell growth assay were performed as for Fig. 2A and C, with measurement of both cell counts
(A) and relative luciferase activity (in relative light units [RLU]) (B) using SF4433 cells. (C) Lysates from cells treated as for panel A were analyzed
by Western blotting for expression of ␤-catenin and ␤-actin, with values for each condition normalized to ␤-actin levels and expressed relative to
untransfected cells (1.0). (D) qRT-PCR was carried out on RNA from cells treated as for panel C, and ␤-catenin mRNA levels were normalized

levels of other proteins involved in meningioma growth, ele-
vated levels of E-cadherin are a contributing component.

miR-200a directly targets the ␤-catenin mRNA and inhibits
␤-catenin/Wnt signaling. To understand how increased levels
of miR-200a lead to decreased levels of ␤-catenin (Fig. 5B),
we evaluated whether the ␤-catenin mRNA is a direct target
for miR-200a. ␤-Catenin message is among the predicted
targets of miR-200a (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/cgi-bin/PicTar
_vertebrate.cgi), with one potentially conserved binding site
within its 3⬘ UTR (Fig. 7A). In order to test whether miR-200a
can bind directly to this 3⬘-UTR site, luciferase reporter vec-
tors encoding a fragment of wt ␤-catenin mRNA 3⬘ UTR (bp
846 to 892) (␤-catenin-wt) or the same region containing mis-
matches in the predicted miR-200a binding site (␤-catenin-mt)
were transfected into HEK 293T cells, which have higher trans-
fection efﬁciency than meningioma cells. Cotransfection of the
␤-catenin-wt construct and pre-miR-200a resulted in signiﬁ-
cantly decreased luciferase activity compared to transfection
with pre-control 1, whereas luciferase activity was not signiﬁ-
cantly reduced in cells cotransfected with ␤-catenin-mt and
pre-miR-200a (Fig. 6B). These data strongly suggest that the
reduced ␤-catenin levels in pre-miR-200a-transfected cells is a
result of direct targeting of the ␤-catenin RNA by miR-200a.
Since Wnt/␤-catenin signaling is involved in tumorigenesis in
a number of malignancies (13, 14, 29), we hypothesized that
the growth-regulatory effect of miR-200a in meningioma cells

might be mediated via inhibition of this signaling pathway
through reduced ␤-catenin levels. To test this, we evaluated
whether the decreased growth of cells transfected with pre-
miR-200a could be rescued by overexpression of ␤-catenin.
Both SF4433 and SF4068 meningioma cell lines were trans-
fected with pre-miR-200a and/or transduced with an adenovi-
rus-based ␤-catenin expression vector (Ad-␤-catenin) alone or
together, plus controls, and 5 h later, the cells were replated
and cell counts were determined over 5 days (Fig. 7C and D).
The growth rates of miR-200a-transfected meningioma cells
and SF4433 and SF4068 cells were reduced by approximately
65% and 43%, respectively, compared to the controls, but con-
comitant overexpression of ␤-catenin increased their growth sig-
niﬁcantly. This supports the thesis that upregulation of ␤-catenin
can partially counteract the growth-inhibitory effect of pre-miR-
200a. In parallel experiments, targets of miR-200a—␤-catenin,
ZEB1, SIP1, and E-cadherin—were examined in Western blots
(Fig. 7E and F). miR-200a overexpression reduced ␤-catenin pro-
tein levels by about 40% in SF4433 and 30% in SF4068 cells
compared to controls, while transduction with the ␤-catenin ex-
pression cassette increased ␤-catenin levels by 40 to 60%. ZEB1
and SIP1 protein levels were found to be reduced approximately
40 to 60% in both cell lines, while E-cadherin protein expression
was increased 60 to 70% compared to controls when miR-200a
was overexpressed. Taken together, these data suggest that de-

FIG. 9. miR-200a and ␤-catenin expression in primary arachnoidal cells and meningioma tumor samples. (A) Primary arachnoidal cells were
left untransfected or transfected with either anti-miR-200a or a control inhibitor, and 3 days later, the cells were ﬁxed with methanol, stained for
␤-catenin by immunocytochemistry (red) and for DNA by dye binding (blue), and visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy. Representative images
are shown (magniﬁcation, ⫻20 and ⫻100). In untransfected and antagomir control-treated cells, ␤-catenin was found predominantly clustered at
the plasma membrane (arrows); in anti-miR-200a-treated cells, ␤-catenin levels were increased and more staining was found in the cytoplasm and
nucleus (arrowheads). (B) Total RNA was isolated from meningioma tumor and arachnoidal tissue samples, and RT-PCRs were performed for
miR-200a and ␤-catenin, cyclin D1, and E-cadherin mRNAs. mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA and miR-200a levels to U6 RNA.
The values relative to arachnoidal tissues are shown as the mean ⫾ SD.

for

creased ␤-catenin levels caused by increased miR-200a contribute
to miR-200a-mediated growth inhibition.

To further examine the effects of miR-200a on Wnt/␤-
catenin signaling, meningioma cells were transduced with a
the Wnt/␤-catenin pathway, Lenti-
reporter construct
TOPFLASH (26), which contains both an expression cassette for
Fluc regulated by 7 ⫻ ␤-catenin T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
factor binding sites and an expression cassette for Rluc under a
constitutive promoter for normalization. The cells were trans-
fected with the reporter construct alone or cotransfected with
pre-control 1 or pre-miR-200a and the reporter construct, and 5 h
later, medium containing 50 ng/ml mouse Wnt (mWnt) ligand
(B&D System) was added and the incubation was continued for
2 days. mWnt treatment resulted in an approximately 10-fold

induction in Fluc activity in cells transduced with the reporter,
whereas cotransfection with pre-miR-200a reduced the activity of
mWNT plus the reporter by approximately 50% compared with
pre-control 1 (Fig. 7G). However, inhibition of endogenous miR-
200a with an inhibitor, anti-miR-200a, did not signiﬁcantly change
the reporter gene activity induced by mWnt. These data indicate
that miR-200a can regulate the Wnt/␤-catenin signaling cas-
cade, presumably by reducing the levels of ␤-catenin. In sup-
port of this, siRNA inhibition of ␤-catenin expression also
inhibited meningioma cell growth (Fig. 8A and B). siRNA
gene silencing of ␤-catenin expression reduced the levels of
␤-catenin protein and mRNA (Fig. 8C and D, respectively).
Wnt/␤-catenin signaling is dysregulated in meningioma tu-
mors. The activation of Wnt signaling results in translocation

FIG. 10. miR-200a levels correlate with levels of ␤-catenin, cyclin D1, and E-cadherin messages. qRT-PCR data for miR-200a and ␤-catenin,
cyclin D1, and E-cadherin mRNAs from three independent experiments were plotted separately for each pair in each experiment (M1, miR-200a
data set 1, versus B1, ␤-catenin data set 1; M2, miR-200a data set 2, versus B2, ␤-catenin data set 2; and M3, miR-200a data set 3, versus B3,
␤-catenin data set 3). Shown in the plot legends are the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r (r), the P value of a signiﬁcant test of the corresponding
coefﬁcient against null (p), and the 95% conﬁdence interval (95%CI). (A) miR-200a versus ␤-catenin. (B) miR-200a versus cyclin D1. (C) miR-

of ␤-catenin from the plasma membrane/cytoplasm into the
nucleus (14). To test whether reduced levels of miR-200a ac-
tivity in arachnoidal cells (meningioma origin) affect the levels
and cellular localization of ␤-catenin, we transfected these cells
in culture with an miR-200a antisense inhibitor or a control
oligonucleotide or left them untransfected and performed im-
munoﬂuorescence staining for ␤-catenin 3 days later. In con-
trols, ␤-catenin showed staining consistent with localization at
the plasma membrane, whereas in miR-200a-inhibitor-trans-

fected cells, ␤-catenin levels appeared higher and showed
strong cytoplasmic and some nuclear localization (Fig. 9A).
These data suggest that downregulation of miR-200a in arach-
noidal cells may contribute to the development of meningioma
tumorigenesis by increasing the levels of ␤-catenin in the nu-
cleus as part of the transformed phenotype.

We also examined the expression levels of ␤-catenin and
cyclin D1, the gene for which is a target of ␤-catenin, in human
meningioma tumor samples. We performed qRT-PCR for

FIG. 11. Immunohistochemical staining of meningioma tumor tissues. Shown is immunohistochemical analysis of parafﬁn-embedded human
brain arachnoidal tissue and meningioma tumors costained for ␤-catenin and E-cadherin. Two representative pictures (A and B) of arachnoidal

messages in randomly selected tumor samples, including four
with miR-200a downregulation (XT2977, XT3771, XT1670,
and XT4263) and four without downregulation of miR-200a
(XT2465, XT3002, XT3016, and XT3858), compared to an
arachnoidal tissue sample. A signiﬁcant inverse correlation was
found between the levels of miR-200a and those of ␤-catenin
and cyclin D1 mRNAs in meningioma tissue samples, while
decreased levels of E-cadherin mRNA were found in all me-
ningioma samples (Fig. 9B; representative correlation graphs
are shown in Fig. 10). This suggests that, in addition to miR-
200a, other factors are involved in the regulation of E-cadherin
expression and that downregulation of E-cadherin mRNA is a
common feature of meningiomas.

Furthermore,

immunohistochemical analysis of sections
from meningioma tumors showed that ␤-catenin was expressed
at higher levels in tumors with lower miR-200a levels than in
those in which miR-200a was not downregulated, with arach-
noidal tissue showing very low levels of ␤-catenin (representa-
tive sections are shown in Fig. 11). E-cadherin was found to be
expressed at lower levels in these tumor samples than in arach-
noidal tissues (Fig. 11). Taken together, these data suggest that
miR-200a regulates the levels of ␤-catenin in meningioma tu-
mors and that downregulation of miR-200a may have an im-
portant role in meningioma growth by increasing ␤-catenin
levels and hence facilitating Wnt signaling.

miR-200a-induced cell death is rescued by ␤-catenin over-
expression. In order to investigate whether ␤-catenin and/or
E-cadherin is involved in miR-200a-induced apoptosis, we
carried out caspase activity measurements under various
conditions of expression. Meningioma cells were transfected
with pre-miR-200a or siRNAs directed against messages for
E-cadherin, ZEB1, SIP1, and ␤-catenin or infected with an
expression vector for ␤-catenin (Ad-␤-catenin), alone and in
combination (Fig. 12A). As previously noted, transfection
with pre-miR-200a signiﬁcantly increased caspase 3/7 activ-
ity. Suppression of ␤-catenin expression also signiﬁcantly
increased this marker of apoptosis, whereas siRNAs for
E-cadherin, ZEB1, and SIP1 mRNAs did not, under these
experimental conditions. Overexpression of ␤-catenin sig-
niﬁcantly rescued miR-200a-mediated apoptosis. However,
siRNA knockdown of E-cadherin in pre-miR-200a-transfected
cells did not signiﬁcantly reduce the caspase 3/7 activity.
siRNA gene silencing of ZEB1 (82%), SIP1 (75%), ␤-catenin
(86%), and E-cadherin (79%) expression was conﬁrmed by
qRT-PCR, compared to that of controls, and normalized to
GAPDH mRNA levels (data not shown). Overexpression of
␤-catenin resulted in a sixfold increase in the mRNA levels of
␤-catenin compared to the control (data not shown). In par-
allel experiments, decreased protein levels of ␤-catenin, ZEB1,
SIP1, and E-cadherin were monitored by Western blotting

results were expressed as relative light units (RLU). The data are shown as the mean plus SD (**, P ⬍ 0.002; ***, P ⬍ 0.0001). (B) In parallel

after the transfection of corresponding siRNAs in meningioma
cells (Fig. 12B). Taken together, these data suggest that among
miR-200a targets, the ␤-catenin mRNA is one of the major
contributors to miR-200a-induced apoptosis.

Decreased miR-200a status and chromosome 1p36 deletion
in meningiomas. Based on studies demonstrating a correlation
between chromosomal alterations and miRNA levels in a va-
riety of cancers (5, 8), we investigated whether the downregu-

lation of miR-200a was associated with chromosomal deletions
in meningiomas. Microarray-based CGH analysis was carried
out with 70 sporadic benign meningioma tumor samples com-
pared with normal human genome samples. Chromosome 1p36
was one of the most commonly deleted regions, with loss in
⬃40% of meningioma samples (Yiping Shen and James F.
Gusella, unpublished data), most frequently in tumors with loss of
chromosome 22 (Fig. 13 shows representative CGH data). The

Sanger database (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/) re-
vealed that chromosome 1p36 harbors genes for miR-200a, miR-
200b, and miR-429. Using meningioma samples used in the
miRNA array analysis, we compared the expression proﬁles of
miR-200a by qRT-PCR in seven meningioma samples with
NF2 deleted, three of which also had 1p36 deleted, and seven
meningioma samples without NF2 deleted, none of which had
1p36 deleted (Table 2). The expression of the miR-200a gene
was signiﬁcantly downregulated (over twofold) in all seven of
the samples with NF2 deleted, irrespective of whether they had
1p36 deleted, and in three of the samples without NF2 deleted,
none of which appeared to have 1p36 deleted. The CGH array
was able to detect only imbalances larger than 35 kb, and
therefore, deletions of the miR-200a gene included in a smaller
genomic region would not have been detected by this analysis.
We also quantiﬁed the expression levels of the other 1p36-
encoded miRNAs, miR-200b and miR-429 (Fig. 14A to C).
Interestingly, miR-200b was not downregulated in any tumors,
while miR-429 was downregulated in 2 out of 14 tumors, and
neither of these 2 tumors appeared to have a deletion in the
1p36 region. Thus, there appear to be multiple modes of re-
duction of miR-200a in these tumors, including deletion of one
allele and transcriptional/processing downregulation of expres-
sion. Upregulation of miR-200b and miR-429 by expression of
their precursor miRNAs did not effect meningioma cell growth
in culture, as assessed by cell counts and Gluc activity (Fig.
14D and E). miRNA levels of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-
429 in these experiments were shown to be increased, as quan-
tiﬁed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 14F). These data suggest that among
the 1p36-encoded miRNAs, only miR-200a has a potential role
in regulating meningioma cell growth, and that in a few cases
downregulation of miR-200a is concurrent with deletion of this
chromosomal region.

In this study, we deﬁned a speciﬁc miRNA proﬁle found in
most sporadic benign human meningioma tumors. Among dys-
regulated miRNAs, miR-200a was one of the most downregu-
lated in meningiomas compared to the arachnoidal tissues
from which these tumors arise. Moreover, we found that miR-
200a functions as a potential tumor suppressor by inhibiting
Wnt/␤-catenin signaling through two complementary mecha-
nisms: direct targeting of the ␤-catenin mRNA, leading to
reduced ␤-catenin levels, and targeting of the mRNAs for
ZEB1 and SIP1 with consequent upregulation of E-cadherin
levels and sequestration of ␤-catenin. Dysregulation of Wnt/
␤-catenin signaling and the E-cadherin cell adhesion system
have been implicated as important events in the initiation
and/or progression of several forms of cancer (3, 4, 16, 33, 34).
These results provide insight into the mechanism by which
reduced levels of miR-200a promote meningioma tumor
growth through elevation of ␤-catenin and Wnt signaling, as
well as reduction of E-cadherin.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report analyzing the
miRNA proﬁles of human meningioma tumors. This study
focused on miR-200a, the most downregulated miRNA (about
25-fold) in 10 out of 14 meningioma tumors (7 with NF2
deleted and 7 without deletion). Elevation of miR-200a in
meningioma cells reduced their apparent growth rate in cul-
ture via induction of apoptosis and suppressed tumor growth in
vivo in a xenograft model. Recent studies showed that the
members of the miR-200 family, including miR-200a, inhibit
EMT as the initial step in tumorigenesis by directly targeting
mRNAs for the transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and SIP1 (4,
12, 20, 32). Reduction of miR-200 members leads to increased
levels of ZEB1 and SIP1, which bind to an E box in the
promoter of the E-cadherin gene, thereby downregulating E-
cadherin expression. Consistent with these previous reports,
our studies showed that increased miR-200a levels act to down-
regulate the expression of ZEB1 and SIP1 in meningioma cells,
with a commensurate increase in E-cadherin expression.

With respect to the role of miR-200a in ␤-catenin signaling,
we found that miR-200a directly targets the 3⬘ UTR of ␤-cate-
nin mRNA. To our knowledge, miR-200a is the ﬁrst miRNA
shown to be involved in the regulation of ␤-catenin levels.
Given the wide role of Wnt/␤-catenin signaling in many can-
cers, including colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, mela-
noma, and ovarian and prostate cancers (33, 34), we presume
that reduction in miR-200a may contribute to increased
␤-catenin signaling in other forms of cancer.

To investigate the downstream effect of miR-200a levels on
␤-catenin-responsive promoters, we overexpressed miR-200a
in meningioma cells and monitored the activity of a promoter
containing T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor binding sites
driving luciferase (Lenti-TOPFLASH [26]) in response to the
Wnt ligand, mWnt3a. Overexpression of miR-200a strongly
inhibited the response of this promoter to Wnt induction, and
this suppression could be overcome with an antisense inhibitor
of miR-200a. Moreover, we found that ␤-catenin overexpres-
sion via an expression vector, Ad-␤-catenin, signiﬁcantly over-
came the growth inhibition caused by elevated miR-200a in
meningioma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that low
levels of miR-200a in meningioma cells activate Wnt signaling

FIG. 14. RT-PCR analysis of miRNAs in 1p36. qRT-PCRs for miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-429 were performed on the RNA samples from
meningioma tumors, including three with 1p36 deleted (XT3731, XT4263, and XT4173) and three without deletions (XT3771, XT2994, and
XT1670), as well as three arachnoidal control tissues. (A) miR-200a. (B) miR-200b. (C) miR-429. The data were normalized to the level of U6
RNAs in each sample. The values are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD. (D and E) To compare the effects of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-429 levels
on meningioma cell growth, precursors for these miRNAs were transfected into SF443Gluc cells, and cell population growth and secreted Gluc
luciferase activity were assessed as for Fig. 2A and C. (F) To monitor miRNA levels under these experimental conditions, we performed qRT-PCR
for miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-429. The data are shown as the means ⫾ SD (***, P ⬍ 0.0001).

by increasing the levels of ␤-catenin mRNA and its availability
to enter the nucleus and activate genes supporting the growth
of meningioma tumors. Furthermore, our data suggest that
miR-200a can act as a key “negative regulator” of the Wnt/␤-
catenin signaling pathway and hence a potential therapeutic
agent, with elevation of miR-200a levels inhibiting the growth
of meningioma tumors in a xenograft model. The stability of
␤-catenin in the cytoplasm is tightly regulated by a degradation
complex containing adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin,
casein kinase 1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 that marks
␤-catenin for proteolytic destruction (16). Mutations in the
APC gene lead to constant activation of Wnt/␤-catenin signal-
ing as one of the main players in cancer (13). Interestingly, in
a recent report, miR-135a and -b were shown to target the 3⬘
UTR of the APC transcript and to suppress its expression in
colon carcinoma (30). Thus, potentiation of ␤-catenin/Wnt
signaling seems to be a critical step in cancer that can be
regulated by miRNAs.

We also evaluated the role of miR-200a in the level and
localization of ␤-catenin in normal primary human arachnoidal

cells in culture as the cell of origin of meningioma tumors.
When levels of miR-200a were decreased by transfection with
a speciﬁc inhibitor, the levels of ␤-catenin increased, and its
localization changed from primarily at the plasma membrane
to a more cytoplasmic and nuclear location. This observation is
consistent with loss of membranous ␤-catenin immunostaining
in most human meningioma tumors (3). Together, these data
implicate the downregulation of miR-200a in activation of
Wnt/␤-catenin signaling in the initial steps of tumorigenesis in
meningiomas.

qRT-PCR analysis of ␤-catenin mRNA in human meningi-
oma tumor samples demonstrated a signiﬁcant inverse corre-
lation between the levels of miR-200a and ␤-catenin mRNA.
This increase in ␤-catenin mRNA levels in meningiomas ap-
peared to have functional consequences, as the levels of a
downstream target gene of the ␤-catenin nuclear complex, the
cyclin D1 gene, were signiﬁcantly elevated in meningioma tis-
sue with low levels of miR-200a. On the other hand, we did not
ﬁnd a correlation between upregulation of c-myc, encoded by
another ␤-catenin target gene, and downregulation of miR-

200a in meningioma tissues (data not shown), possibly due to
other modes of c-myc regulation in tumors (35).

Our ﬁndings also support a role for E-cadherin in miR-200a-
mediated growth inhibition of meningioma cells, as an siRNA
for the E-cadherin message substantially blocked growth inhi-
bition of meningioma cells resulting from elevated miR-200a.
Reduced expression of miR-200a increases the levels of the
transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and SIP1, which in turn down-
regulate E-cadherin in meningiomas, as shown by immunohis-
tochemistry of meningioma tumors (3, 41). E-cadherin levels
were also low in arachnoidal tissue and meningioma tumors
that had no decrease in miR-200a levels, so a deﬁciency in
miR-200a expression appears to be only one of the factors
responsible for the E-cadherin reduction in meningiomas.

The activity of the Wnt/␤-catenin signaling pathway is mainly
determined by the amount of ␤-catenin free in the cytoplasm
versus that sequestered in the plasma membrane or APC degra-
dation complex (28, 29). Decreased levels of E-cadherin in me-
ningioma cells should thus make more ␤-catenin available in the
cytoplasm/nucleus, at the same time possibly decreasing links
between E-cadherin and the cytoskeleton. The latter effect
should also reduce cell-to-cell adhesion of arachnoidal cells as
part of the tumorigenesis process. Disruption of cell-cell com-
munication through miR-200a downregulation may thus pro-
mote meningioma tumor growth and progression through both
decreased E-cadherin and elevated ␤-catenin levels.

In conclusion, this study has deﬁned an miRNA signature of
benign meningioma tumors and demonstrated a key role for
miR-200a downregulation in promoting the growth of these
tumors. Reduced levels of miR-200a appear to contribute to
tumorigenesis through two converging pathways mediated by
upregulation of three mRNA targets. Those for ZEB1 and
SIP1 lead to increased levels of these transcriptional repres-
sors, which decreases the levels of E-cadherin in the tumors.
Upregulation of a new ␤-catenin mRNA target for miR-200a,
discovered in this study, results in more ␤-catenin being avail-
able to enter the nucleus and activate genes in the Wnt signal-
ing pathway. These miR-200a-mediated tumorigenic processes
are undoubtedly shared with other tumors and provide poten-
tial targets for therapeutic intervention.
