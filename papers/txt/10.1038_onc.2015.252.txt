Approximately 30% of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma die from pulmonary metastases. The mechanisms that drive sarcoma
metastasis are not well understood. Recently, we identiﬁed miR-182 as a driver of sarcoma metastasis in a primary mouse model of
soft-tissue sarcoma. We also observed elevated miR-182 in a subset of primary human sarcomas that metastasized to the lungs.
Here, we show that myogenic differentiation factors regulate miR-182 levels to contribute to metastasis in mouse models. We ﬁnd
that MyoD directly binds the miR-182 promoter to increase miR-182 expression. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that
Pax7 can promote sarcoma metastasis in vivo through MyoD-dependent regulation of pro-metastatic miR-182. Taken together,
these results suggest that sarcoma metastasis can be partially controlled through Pax7/MyoD-dependent activation of miR-182 and
provide insight into the role that myogenic transcription factors have in sarcoma progression.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 90% of all cancer deaths are due to metastatic
disease.1 Unlike primary tumors, which are often controlled locally
with surgery and radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy often
fails to eradicate metastases. Many of the somatic mutations
necessary for metastasis of epithelial tumors are present within
distinct subclones of the primary tumor that ultimately give rise to
distant metastases.2,3 In some cases,
the risk of metastasis
in the genomic sequence,4 copy
correlates with changes
number5 or gene expression6–10 of the primary tumor. Despite
the clinical importance of metastasis, the molecular events that
confer these metastatic properties are not well understood. Due to
the multiple steps involved and the interaction with the stromal
environment,
it is challenging to distinguish which genes are
directly responsible for contributing to metastatic growth (known
as ‘drivers’) and which genes are elevated as a result of the
metastatic process (known as ‘bystanders’). Thus, a current
challenge in the ﬁeld is to identify drivers of metastasis, which
could serve as biomarkers in primary tumors to risk stratify
patients for systemic therapy and serve as potential anti-
metastatic targets.

(STS) are malignant

tumors of

Soft-tissue sarcomas

including muscle, ﬁbrous tissue,

the
connective tissue,
fat, blood
vessels and nerves. These mesenchymal tumors metastasize to the
lungs in over 30% of patients, resulting in a median patient
survival of 15 months.11 Due to a lack of molecular markers that
accurately classify sarcomas for their potential to metastasize, at
our institution adult patients with most types of STS do not
routinely receive adjuvant chemotherapy because of its signiﬁcant
side effects and limited response rate (~15–20%).12 Efforts to
understand the metastatic process in sarcoma are hindered by the
indeed, over 50
heterogeneity and rarity of sarcoma samples;

distinct sarcoma subtypes are known. One of the most common
types of STS diagnosed in adults is undifferentiated pleomorphic
sarcoma (UPS, previously known as malignant ﬁbrous histiocy-
toma). UPS tumors are characterized by complex karyotypes
reﬂecting genomic instability and often harbor
inactivating
mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway. Moreover,
mutations in oncogenes are also required for sarcomagenesis,
and mutations associated with Ras pathway signaling have been
identiﬁed in both human and mouse UPS.13 Despite efforts to
deﬁne gene signatures for distinct sarcoma subtypes,
little is
known concerning the molecular events contributing to sarcoma
metastasis.

We recently used genetically engineered mice to delete or
overexpress miR-182 in primary mouse sarcomas. We demon-
strated that miR-182 drives sarcoma metastasis through regulation
of several proteases that contribute to local
invasion, thereby
increasing extravasation into the blood and ultimately lung
metastases.14 Others have recently shown that miR-182 levels
increase ~ 500 fold during muscle stem cell activation.15 Myogenic
development in the adult begins in muscle stem cells, called
satellite cells, which express the Pax family paired domain
transcription factors Pax7 and/or Pax3. Activation of quiescent
satellite cells leads to the expression of the MyoD family myogenic
regulatory factors (MRFs) Myf5 and MyoD, which drive the
expression of genes in myoblasts. Differentiation of myoblasts
into terminal muscle ﬁbers is regulated by Mrf4 and myogenin.
Thus, a cascade of myogenic transcription factors are responsible
for muscle differentiation16 and could have a role in controlling
miR-182 levels.
In a series of 88 high-grade STSs originally
diagnosed as UPS, tumors with myogenic differentiation (n = 26)
showed a higher metastatic rate than tumors without myogenic
differentiation (n = 62, P = 0.006).17 On the basis of these data in

human UPS, the identiﬁcation of miR-182 as a driver of sarcoma
metastasis,14 and the regulation of miR-182 during muscle
development,15 we hypothesized that myogenic trascription
factors might regulate miR-182 to drive metastasis in UPS.

RESULTS
Myogenic transcription factors are enriched in a subset of
metastatic mouse sarcomas
To investigate whether transcription factors that regulate myo-
genic differentiation correlate with metastasis in primary mouse
sarcomas, we used the Cre-LoxP system to generate primary STSs
in mice.18 Sarcomas develop after intramuscular delivery of an
adenovirus that expresses Cre (Ad-Cre) into compound mutant
mice with conditional mutations
in both oncogenic Kras
(LSL-KrasG12D) and mutant p53 (p53ﬂox/ﬂox), which we refer to as
KP mice. Cre-mediated recombination simultaneously (1) inactivates
p53 function by deleting exons 2 through 10 and (2) activates

oncogenic Kras by removing an upstream ﬂoxed transcription/
translation STOP cassette (termed ‘loxP-STOP-loxP’, or LSL
cassette). These KP mice form high-grade spindle cell sarcomas
at the site of injection that resemble UPS both histologically and
by geneset enrichment analysis.18,19 Although the available
genomic data suggest that human UPS may often arise in the
absence of Kras and p53 mutations, in the related STS rhabdomyo-
sarcoma, where more comprehensive genomic data are available,
mutations of Ras and p53 commonly occur.20,21

This model exhibits many hallmarks of human sarcoma
pathogenesis, including the development of lung metastases in
~ 40% of the mice.22,23 However, the rapid growth of the primary
tumors necessitates sacriﬁce of the animal before determining the
full metastatic potential of the tumor. To mimic the development
of pulmonary metastases that may occur
following surgical
resection in patients with no adjuvant therapy, we amputated
the tumors to generate a cohort of metastatically annotated
sarcomas according to the schematic described in Figure 1a.

Myogenic regulation of miR-182
RD Dodd et al

After
the sarcoma-bearing limb was amputated, mice were
monitored for up to 6 months for the development of pulmonary
metastases. The presence or absence of lung metastases was
conﬁrmed by histopathological examination of hematoxylin and
eosin-stained sections of lung by a sarcoma pathologist (LD). With
this approach, primary sarcomas were unambiguously divided
into two phenotypes: metastatic (that is, developed pulmonary
metastasis) and nonmetastatic (that
is, did not yield any
discernible lung metastases).

We performed real-time PCR for multiple myogenic transcrip-
tion factors in a cohort of 30 primary mouse sarcomas, of which 15
subsequently developed metastases. We examined satellite cell
markers (Pax7 and Pax3), all four members of the MRF family
(Myf5, MyoD, Mrf4 and myogenin) and a marker of terminal
muscle differentiation, myosin (Figures 1b–h). We found that
expression of Pax7, Pax3, Myf5, MyoD, myogenin and myosin were
enriched in a subset of metastatic primary STSs from KP mice
(Figures 1b–g). Although expression of Mrf4 was elevated in
metastatic tumors, this was not statistically signiﬁcant (Figure 1f).
Immunohistochemical analysis for Pax7 and MyoD conﬁrmed that
protein levels for these myogenic factors were expressed at higher
levels in metastatic primary tumors (n = 10) than nonmetastatic
primary tumors (n = 10, Figures 1j–m). Next, we examined the
miR-182 levels in these tumors. We found a striking correlation
between expression of myogenic factors and miR-182 (Figure 1i).
Tumors with high miR-182 expression (shown in green, Figure 1i)
are also illustrated in red in Figures 1b–h. These ﬁndings
suggested that miR-182 levels may be partially regulated by a
myogenic differentiation program in primary sarcomas. We also
examined the expression of miR-182, Pax7 and MyoD in lung
metastases. Interestingly, the expression of miR-182 by real-time
(RT)–PCR was similar in the lung metastasis compared with the
matched primary tumor, but Pax7/MyoD-positive primary tumors
(n = 5) did not maintain the expression of
these factors
(Supplementary Figure 1). This suggests that after colonization
in the lung, there is no selective pressure to maintain expression
of myogenic differentiation.

MyoD directly binds to and controls miR-182 expression
To determine whether any of the myogenic transcription factors
directly regulated miR-182 levels, we performed an in silico
analysis (Genomatix, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) of
the miR-182
promoter.14 This analysis identiﬁed several potential binding sites
for the myogenic factor MyoD (Figure 2a). Chromatin immuno-
precipitation demonstrated that MyoD, but not another myogenic
transcription factor, Pax7, can directly bind the miR-182 promoter
at two distinct sites (Figure 2b). We used a luciferase reporter
assay to determine that MyoD sites 2 and 3 are most important for
expression from the miR-182 promoter
cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). To determine whether MyoD-speciﬁc
control of miR-182 levels could contribute to metastasis, we
examined an independent cohort of KP mouse sarcomas (n = 18)
and found a high correlation between miR-182 levels and MyoD
protein expression.
(Figure 2c). To determine whether MyoD
expression also correlates with metastasis in human sarcomas, we
examined a cohort of human UPS tumors. Twenty fresh frozen
UPS samples were obtained from patients with known metastatic
outcome that did not receive prior therapy (n = 12 metastatic and
n = 8 nonmetastatic). Using real-time PCR, we determined that
MyoD mRNA was enriched in a subset of metastatic tumors
(n = 5/12), whereas MyoD was expressed at much lower levels in
nonmetastatic samples (Figure 2d), although this difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant. Importantly, the presence of MyoD in
only 40% of the metastatic tumors supports the view of metastasis
as a complex biological process that utilizes a diverse array of
biological mechanisms, and suggests that alternative or comple-
mentary pathways may drive metastasis for the other tumors.

In cells derived from primary mouse sarcomas from KP mice
(Ctrl), small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of MyoD
decreased miR-182 transcript
levels (Figures 2e and f and
Supplementary Figure 3E). Little effect on miR-182 levels was
seen following MyoD knockdown in sarcoma cells with constitu-
tive expression of miR-182 from the ROSA26 promoter (LSL-
miR-182, Figures 2e and f). To determine whether the MyoD-
dependent
regulation of miR-182 could impact metastatic
phenotypes, we examined the ability of MyoD expression to
inﬂuence the in vitro migration and invasion of sarcoma cells with
endogenous or constitutive expression of miR-182 (Figures 2g and
h). Whereas knockdown of MyoD blunted migration/invasion in
control sarcoma cells, overexpression of miR-182 was sufﬁcient to
maintain invasion across the transwell membrane. Taken together,
these results suggest that MyoD-mediated regulation of miR-182
can inﬂuence metastatic properties in sarcoma.

Pax7 contributes to sarcoma metastasis
To further deﬁne the myogenic proteins that may inﬂuence pro-
metastatic miR-182 expression, we sought to identify upstream
factors that regulate MyoD expression in tumors. In a subset of
primary metastatic tumors, we found elevation of Pax7 and Pax3
(Figures 1b and c), two factors that are regulators of MyoD
expression during embryonic and postnatal myogenesis.24
Although both Pax7 and Pax3 are genetically upstream of MyoD,
a review of the literature made Pax7 a more attractive candidate
for several reasons. First, Pax7 is universally expressed in satellite
cells, whereas Pax3 expression is limited to speciﬁc muscle
groups.25 Second, Pax7 is known to directly bind to and activate
the MyoD promoter and displays stronger transcriptional activa-
tion properties than Pax3 in C2C12 cells.26,27 Third, expression of
dominant-negative Pax7 abolishes MyoD expression in satellite
cells in culture.28 Taken together, this makes Pax7 an attractive
candidate for controlling MyoD levels in metastatic sarcoma.

We identiﬁed a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between
levels of miR-182 and Pax7 protein in the mouse tumor cohort
(Figure 3a). Moreover, in the cohort of human UPS tumors, we
determined that Pax7 mRNA was enriched in a subset of
metastatic tumors (n = 6/12, Figure 3b). Thus,
in this cohort of
human UPS tumors, elevated Pax7 expression was exclusive to
metastatic tumors and correlated with miR-182 expression,
making it a promising candidate to promote sarcoma metastasis.
Of note, there was a trend for elevated Pax7 mRNA expression to
correlate with high miR-182 expression in the primary tumors, but
this correlation did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P = 0.08) in
this relatively small sample size (Figure 3c).

To determine whether Pax7 expression could inﬂuence meta-
static phenotypes in our mouse model similar to MyoD, we
overexpressed Pax7 in KP sarcoma cell
lines, which induced
miR-182 expression (Figure 3d). As a control, we overexpressed
Pax7 in sarcoma cells derived from miR-182ﬂox/ﬂox; LSL-KrasG12D;
p53ﬂox/ﬂox mice14 that lack expression of miR-182 (KO cells).
Although Pax7 expression increased miR-182 levels in wild-type
sarcoma cells, it was unable to induce miR-182 expression in the
knockout cell
lines (Figure 3d). Of note, Pax7 increased both
migration and invasion properties in wild-type cells, but was
unable to inﬂuence in vitro metastatic phenotypes in miR-182
knockout (Figures 3e and f) or knockdown cells (Supplementary
Figures 3A–C). In tandem, we knocked down Pax7 in sarcoma cells
derived from mice with conditional overexpression of miR-182.14
In these cells, Pax7 siRNA inhibited migration and invasion of the
control cell line, but Pax7 knockdown showed minimal effect in
cells with constitutive expression of miR-182 (Figures 3g–i). Taken
together, these results suggest that Pax7-driven expression of
miR-182 is sufﬁcient to drive metastatic properties in vitro.

Pax7 and MyoD regulate pro-metastatic miR-182 to increase
sarcoma metastasis
To further deﬁne the relationship between Pax7, MyoD and
miR-182 in the metastatic sarcoma cohort, we determined that
Pax7 and MyoD protein expression exhibited a strong degree of
correlation in the mouse tumor cohort (Figure 4a). To determine
whether Pax7 acts through MyoD to regulate miR-182, we used
siRNA to knockdown MyoD in sarcoma cells that overxpressed
Pax7 (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure 3D). Although over-
expression of Pax7 alone was capable of
inducing miR-182
expression (Figure 4c, purple bars), siRNA knockdown of MyoD
prevented Pax7 from elevating miR-182 levels (Figure 4c, yellow
bars). Taken together, these results suggest that Pax7-mediated
regulation of miR-182 occurs through MyoD.

We next tested the role of Pax7 in modulating miR-182 levels,
MyoD expression and metastatic phenotypes through siRNA
knockdown of Pax7 in two KP sarcoma cell
In both cell
lines, knockdown of Pax7 with two distinct duplexes resulted in
decreased miR-182 levels (Figure 4d). Knockdown of Pax7 also
impaired migration and invasion of these cells in a transwell assay
(Figures 4e and f). Of note, knockdown of Pax7 resulted in a
corresponding decrease in MyoD protein levels, whereas MyoD
knockdown did not alter Pax7 expression (Figures 4d and 2e).

used two cell lines derived from primary sarcomas resulting from
Ad-Cre injection into mice that were LSL-KrasG12D; p53ﬂox/ﬂox (KP
cells) or LSL-KrasG12D; Ink4a/Arfﬂox/ﬂox (KI cells). High levels of Pax7
were detected by quantitative PCR and immunoblot
in cells
expressing Flag-tagged Pax7 (Supplementary Figure 4A). Over-
expression of Pax7 did not alter the growth kinetics of the cells
(Supplementary Figures 4B–D). Both Pax7-expressing cell
lines
showed elevated levels of metastatic phenotypes in vitro, including
increased invasion/migration in both transwell and wound healing
assays (Supplementary Figures 4E–H). To directly address the
contribution of Pax7 to metastatic lung colonization in vivo, we
injected sarcoma cells expressing either Flag-alone or Flag-tagged
Pax7 orthotopically into immunocompetent mice. Following
amputation of syngeneic orthotopic tumors, mice were sacriﬁced
6 months later, and the area of their lungs containing metastatic
colonies was calculated from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides.

Lungs from mice receiving the Pax7-expressing cells showed
increased metastatic lung area (Supplementary Figures 4I and J).
Taken together, these data show that Pax7 expression can induce
metastatic phenotypes in sarcoma cells in vivo.

miR-182 is required for Pax7-mediated metastasis in vivo
To further explore the Pax7/miR-182 relationship in metastasis, we
performed an orthotopic allograft amputation experiment using
sarcoma cells that expressed Pax7 or Flag-alone with or without an
anti-miR-182 sponge (n = 9–10 mice per cell line; Figure 5a). The
efﬁcacy of the miR-182 sponge was assessed by the expression of
the miR-182 target Rsu-1 (Figure 5a).14 Following injection of cells
into the lower left ﬂank of nude mice, tumors were amputated at
200–300 mm3. Mice were sacriﬁced 7 weeks later or when they
showed signs of pulmonary distress, and the lungs were examined
for
the presence of metastases. Expression of Pax7 greatly

decreased the survival of the mice, while increasing the number
and percent of metastatic lung growths (Figures 5b–e). Reduction
of miR-182 levels by the anti-182 sponge decreased the Pax7-
dependent metastatic phenotype by increasing the survival of
mice and decreasing the area and number of lung metastases.
These results suggest a model where Pax7-dependent metastasis
requires miR-182 for sarcoma metastasis in vivo (Figure 5f).

DISCUSSION
Currently, over 30% of adult sarcoma patients develop metastatic
disease. We previously demonstrated that miR-182 can contribute
to metastasis in a mouse model of STS.14 However, the events
controlling miR-182 expression in these tumors remained unex-
plored. In this current study, we describe a novel mechanism where
myogenic differentiation factors regulate miR-182 expression and
contribute to sarcoma metastasis in vivo. Using a mouse model of
STS, we observed expression of several myogenic transcription
factors,
in primary metastatic mouse
tumors. Expression of Pax7 and MyoD correlated with miR-182
levels in both mouse and human sarcoma samples. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays conﬁrmed that MyoD
regulates miR-182 expression through direct binding to the
miR-182 promoter. In vitro analyses showed MyoD directly controls
miR-182 expression and metastatic phenotypes, whereas Pax7
requires MyoD for
the regulation of miR-182 levels. Using
orthotopic allografts of cells engineered with an anti-miR-182
sponge, we determined that Pax7-expressing cells require miR-182
to drive sarcoma metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these data
suggests that one pathway to activate miR-182 in metastatic
sarcoma is through a Pax7/MyoD-dependent mechanism. As the
miR-182 promoter contains multiple binding sites for other
transcription factors, we postulate that miR-182 activation can
occur through multiple mechanisms, some of which are indepen-
dent of myogenic factors (Sachdeva et al., unpublished results).

Myogenic transcription factors have a critical role in muscle cell
development during embryogenesis. For example, precursor cells
originating in the somites require Pax3 for migration to the sites of
muscle wall formation. We speculate that sarcoma cells could be
hijacking this developmental program to activate migratory
phenotypes required for metastasis. Just as many epithelial
cancers utilize the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to express
genes that normally control cell motility during embryonic
development, we postulate that myogenic transcription factors
may also provide a metastatic advantage at the primary tumor site
through increased migration.

This work expands on the observation that expression of
in human undifferentiated pleomorphic
myogenic markers
sarcomas correlates with poor patient outcome.17 Our work
suggests a mechanism for the role of myogenic transcription
factors in promoting metastasis in UPS. Recent work from other
groups suggests that this theme can be extended to other
sarcoma subtypes.
In a particularly aggressive subtype of
rhabdomyosarcoma, a recurrent somatic mutation in MyoD blocks
wild-type function.28 Instead of activating canonical MyoD targets
involved in differentiation,
the mutated MyoD binds MYC
consensus sequences. This switches downstream transcriptional
proﬁles from muscle differentiation genes to proliferative targets.
In combination with our data in UPS, these ﬁndings identify an
important role for myogenic transcription factors, such as MyoD,
in promoting aggressive behavior in sarcomas and suggest further
investigations of these proteins in other sarcoma subtypes.

This work reveals one mechanism by which myogenic transcrip-
tion factors regulate miR-182 to induce pro-metastatic phenotypes
in murine systems in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, further evaluating
the role of Pax7, MyoD and miR-182 in human sarcomas has the
potential to provide information related to metastatic risk. If the
analysis of this pathway in large, retrospective sarcoma patient

cohorts supports this hypothesis, then prospective studies could be
undertaken to deﬁne the prognostic value of this pathway for
patients with UPS. Thus, our results provide support for future
studies investigating the potential prognostic value and biological
role of myogenic transcription proteins in human STS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse sarcoma model
All mouse work was performed in accordance with Duke University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols. Tumors
were generated by injection of Adenovirus-expressing Cre recombinase
(Ad-Cre; University of Iowa, Vector core) into the lower left leg of p53ﬂox/ﬂox;
LSL-KRasG12D compound mutant mice as previously described.18 Following
amputation, mice were monitored for up to 6 months for development of
lung metastases.

Quantitative RT–PCR
RNA was isolated from tumors and cells in TRIZOL, and complementary
DNA synthesis was performed with iScript (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Quantitative RT–PCR was performed on an iQ5 instrument (BioRad) using
the delta–delta Ct method. Primer
sequences can be found in
Supplementary Table S1.

Human samples
UPS samples were obtained from MD Anderson (Houston, TX, USA) under a
protocol approved by the Duke University and MD Anderson Institutional
Review Boards. Frozen tumor samples were processed using TRIZOL, and
complementary DNA synthesis was performed with iScript
(BioRad).
Quantitative RT–PCR was performed on an iQ5 instrument (BioRad) using
the delta–delta Ct method.

Histology and immunostaining
Antibodies for immunohistochemistry included: Pax7 (a gift from Chen-Min
Fan, Carnegie Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA), Ki67 (BD Pharmagen, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) and MyoD (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA). All immunostaining
was performed with citrate-based antigen retrieval, and M.O.M. Kits (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used for Pax7 staining.

In vitro studies
The mouse sarcoma cell lines KP and KI were derived from primary sarcomas
that developed after intramuscular Ad-Cre injection into a p53 ﬂox/ﬂox; LSL-
KrasG12D or Ink4a/Arf ﬂox/ﬂox; LSL-KrasG12D mouse. Mouse sarcoma cells for
miR-182 experiments were described previously.14 Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium+10% fetal bovine serum. For colony
formation studies, cells were seeded at 500 per well in a 6-well dish, and the
number of existing colonies was determined by crystal violet staining after
2 weeks. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate, and the experiment
was
repeated three times. Data shown are representative of one
independent experiment. For cell doubling assays, 1000 cells were seeded
overnight and the number of cell doublings was counted daily for 4 days.
Migration and invasion assays were completed using the Cultrex Cell
Invasion Assay, per manufacturer’s instructions. Scratch assays were
performed on conﬂuent monolayers, with images obtained on an Olympus
CKX41 microscope and distances quantiﬁed in ImagePro (Rockville, MD,
USA). Data shown represent the average of three independent experiments.
For siRNA studies, sarcoma cell lines were transfected with siRNAs against
Pax7 or MyoD with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were harvested after 36 and 48-h post
transfection for RNA and protein analysis, respectively.

In vivo allografts
129/SvJae or athymic female nude mice were injected intramuscularly with
10 000 cells in the lower left ﬂank. Mice were randomly picked for which
cell
tumors were
amputated and mice were followed for 6 months. Mice were sacriﬁced
when they presented with symptoms of lung metastases, such as labored
breathing and hunched posture. Investigators were blind to experimental
groups when assessing animal health. Mice that died before lung harvest
were excluded from analysis. Following sacriﬁce, lungs were inﬂated with
formalin before harvest and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were
quantiﬁed on ImagePro to calculate the percent of lung volume containing
metastases. Three sections of lung per mouse were examined.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA) and lysed for 10 min on ice with RIPA buffer
(radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer; Sigma). Protein concentration
was performed with BCA Protein Concentration Assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA). MiniProtean Tris-glycine gels (BioRad) were transferred
to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride by wet transfer. Antibodies include histone H3
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and others described in
these methods.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
KP cells stably expressing Flag and Pax7 were seeded at 50% conﬂuence
overnight. Nuclear proteins bound to the genomic DNA were cross-linked
directly in the cell culture medium in 1% formaldehyde at
room
temperature. Chromatin was digested with Micrococcal Nuclease for
20 min at 37 °C and incubated with respective antibodies overnight.
Protein G agarose beads captured the antibody–chromatin complex. DNA
was separated from beads and eluted using chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion elution buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), puriﬁed with spin columns
and quantiﬁed using speciﬁc PCR primers (Supplementary Table S1).

Luciferase assay
Cells were transfected with different miR-182 promoter constructs with or
without MyoD plasmid (lentiviral system from System Biosciences,
Mountain View, CA, USA). Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection.
Luciferase assays were performed as previously described.14 Plasmids with
different miR-182 promoters were cloned into a luciferase vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). miR-182 promoter sequences were PCR
ampliﬁed with high-ﬁdelity Taq polymerase enzyme (Invitrogen) using
mouse genomic DNA as a template. Primer sequences are provided in
Supplementary Table S1. The ampliﬁed fragment was cloned into a Pgl3
basic vector at Kpn1 and Xho1 sites (Cho-Cho Cloning Kit). To mutate the
putative MyoD-binding sites in the miR-182 promoter, we adopted
a two-step PCR ligation method with two sets of overlapping primers
(Supplementary Table S1) that span the new binding site with mutations.
The two ampliﬁed PCR fragments were used as a template for the second
PCR using primers Mir-182-pro-5.4 -kpn1 and Mir-182-pro-3.1-rev-xho1 and
cloned using a similar strategy as described above.
