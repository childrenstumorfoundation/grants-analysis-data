Markers of Pancreatic Cancer: Working Toward Early Detection

Michael Goggins

Clinical
Cancer
Research

Because early detection of pancreatic cancer is the best way to cure this disease, investigators continue to
try to identify accurate markers of early pancreatic cancer. Because early-stage pancreatic cancer is generally
asymptomatic, the only reliable way to detect it is by targeting individuals at increased risk for pancreatic
screening. Clin Cancer Res; 17(4); 635–7. Ó2011 AACR.

In this issue of Clinical Cancer Research, Brand and
colleagues report on their evaluation of the diagnostic
performance of measuring 83 circulating proteins in sera
of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (N ¼
333), compared with those with benign pancreatic condi-
tions (N ¼ 144, benign pancreatic cysts, pancreatitis), and
healthy controls (N ¼ 227; ref. 1). The selected markers
required using commercially available antibodies and were
detected in multiplex fashion with the Luminex platform.
The markers included those previously reported to have
potential diagnostic utility for pancreatic cancer [CA19–9,
CEA, osteopontin, MIC-1, TIMP-1, HIP (REG3), osteopro-
tegerin, ICAM-1, SAA]. The remaining markers were mostly
cytokines, chemokines, hormones, and apolipoproteins.
Samples were split randomly into training and blinded
validation sets prior to analysis. The best 3-marker panel
identified for discriminating patients with pancreatic can-
cer from healthy controls (CA19–9, ICAM-1, osteoprote-
gerin) yielded a sensitivity-specificity (SN-SP) of 78 to 94%
in the validation set. The best 3-marker panel identified for
discriminating patients with pancreatic cancer from disease
controls (CA19–9, CEA, TIMP-1) yielded a SN-SP of 71 to
90%, superior to the performance of CA19–9 alone (SN-SP,
51 to 90%). Several other marker combinations had similar
diagnostic utility.

The strengths of this multicenter study include the large
number of cases, disease controls, and healthy controls
enrolled; the use of antibody-based assays; and standar-
dized sample processing and rigorous data analysis. The
study provided insight into the performance of many
markers
combinations with
improved performance over serum CA19–9 measurements
alone. One important limitation was the inclusion of

patients with all stages of pancreatic cancer, approximately
half of whom had stage IV disease. As pancreatic cancer
progresses and spreads beyond the pancreas, abnormalities
that are not specific to pancreatic cancer accumulate. As a
result, marker behavior is likely to be significantly different
among patients with early- versus late-stage pancreatic
cancer (see Fig. 1). Although the use of disease controls
can help identify nonspecific alterations, advanced pan-
creatic cancer is associated with many secondary changes
including pancreatic injury, inflammation and fibrosis,
obstructive jaundice, diabetes, weight loss, cachexia, tumor
invasion into the duodenal wall and other surrounding
organs, and metastases to the liver, peritoneum, and else-
where, and it is difficult to account for all of the nonspecific
abnormalities associated with advanced pancreatic cancer
using disease controls. Even CA19–9, a relatively specific
marker of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, reaches
higher levels and achieves greater diagnostic accuracy when
measured in patients with advanced compared with early-
stage pancreatic cancer.

Many of the elevated markers evaluated by Brand and
colleagues in pancreatic cancer patients were acute phase
reactants (SAA, ICAM-1, CRP, osteoprotegerin) whose
expression is regulated by inflammatory cytokines and
whose primary source is probably not pancreatic cancer
cells. These markers are elevated in many inflammatory
conditions and have limited diagnostic utility. For exam-
ple, elevations of ICAM-1 and/or osteoprotegerin are
observed not only in chronic inflammatory conditions
but are also in patients with conditions common to a
pancreatic cancer population, including diabetes, hyperch-
olesterolemia, atherosclerotic disease, obesity, and hyper-
tension. This observation likely explains why markers that
did best in the Brand study were proteins thought to arise
predominantly from pancreatic cancer cells (CA19–9, CEA,
and TIMP-1). Although some of the acute-phase reactant
markers tested did show some ability to discriminate
between pancreatic cancers and the benign pancreatic
conditions, their diagnostic performance may not be as
useful in real world settings where many patients with
suspected pancreatic cancer have comorbidities such as
diabetes, atherosclerosis, etc. For these reasons, investigat-
ing marker behavior in patients with advanced pancreatic

Figure 1. The production of tumor markers at different stages in the natural history of pancreatic cancer development. Markers that become readily detectable
only in advanced stages of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after the onset of clinical symptoms will not provide opportunities for early detection and
cure. Detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its precursors at a curable stage requires screening asymptomatic individuals with markers that
can reliably detect early-stage disease such as PanIN-3 or stage I pancreatic cancer.

cancer may not be the best strategy for identifying specific
markers of early pancreatic cancer.

In current clinical practice, markers have a limited role in
diagnosing pancreatic cancer. The best initial diagnostic test
for suspected pancreatic cancer is a pancreatic-protocol com-
puterized tomography (CT) scan. Endoscopic ultrasound is
also highly accurate for detecting pancreatic neoplasms. Only
highly accurate marker(s) will supplant pancreatic imaging
tests as initial tests for pancreatic cancer. For this reason,
research efforts are continuing to try to identify highly
accurate markers with better performance than the panel
identified by Brand and colleagues. Circulating mutant DNA
levels reflect tumor burden in patients with colorectal cancer
(2) and could prove to be useful for diagnosing pancreatic
cancers. Currently, assays measuring circulating mutant DNA
are research tools but could become part of clinical practice in
the near future. Efforts are underway to develop newer anti-
body-based tests for proteins overexpressed in pancreatic
cancer (3). In addition to ongoing proteomics research for
protein markers, other markers are under investigation for
their diagnostic utility, including aberrantly methylated DNA

(4), autoantibodies, aberrantly glycosylated molecules (5),
and microRNAs (6).

When evaluating an early detection marker, it is impor-
tant to determine the goal of early detection. Although
recent estimates of cancer evolution suggest that pancreatic
cancers can reside in the pancreas for several years before
metastasis (7), anecdotal evidence from pancreatic screen-
ing studies suggests that some patients can progress from
apparently noninvasive pancreatic disease to metastatic
pancreatic cancer between short screening intervals. And
because cure of invasive pancreatic cancer is rarely achieved
even for patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer, the
primary goal of pancreatic screening programs for high-risk
individuals has been to prevent pancreatic cancer devel-
oping by detecting and resecting pancreatic precursor
lesions. These precursor lesions include pancreatic intrae-
pithelial neoplasias (PanIN) and intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasms (IPMN; ref. 8). Although low-grade
PanINs are common, high-grade PanINs (PanIN-3, carci-
noma in situ) are usually found in pancreata with an
invasive pancreatic cancer and in high-risk individuals

screened for pancreatic neoplasia. PanINs are too small to
be detected by pancreatic imaging, but thanks to better
pancreatic imaging, IPMNs are increasingly diagnosed and
treated. Removing IPMNs or widespread PanIN by pan-
creatic resection in patients with a strong family history of
pancreatic cancer seems to prevent the development of
pancreatic cancer (9, 10). The prevalence of detectable
neoplasia identified by pancreatic screening depends on
the risk of those being screened. Most screening programs
target individuals aged 50 with multiple first-degree rela-
tives with pancreatic cancer or BRCA2/p16 and other germ-
line mutation carriers with a family history of pancreatic
cancer. Using endoscopic ultrasound as a screening tool,

indicate that individuals with less extensive family histories

risk of pancreatic cancer to justify screening (Kurtz RC,
Frucht H, et al., unpublished data; ref. 11).

of preinvasive disease, then marker research should focus
on markers of preinvasive disease. Research is attempting to
identify markers in pancreatic fluid that could reliably
identify high-grade PanIN (4). Because screening brings
with it the risk of overtreatment, more controlled trials are
needed to better determine the risks, benefits, and optimal
approaches to pancreatic screening.

The available evidence indicates that the best way to
prevent the development of pancreatic cancer and to iden-
tify early pancreatic cancer is to follow high-risk individuals
with screening protocols. Investigating marker behavior in
these high-risk groups is likely to be the best way to identify
accurate markers of early pancreatic cancer that can
improve the accuracy of pancreatic screening.
