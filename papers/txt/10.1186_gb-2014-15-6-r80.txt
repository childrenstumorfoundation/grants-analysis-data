Abstract

Background: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit recurrent breakpoints
processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However, region-specific disease-associated copy number
changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these
non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated.
Results: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum
of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair
mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints,
identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem
repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are refractory to analysis by
standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify
across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in both patients, and were
mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally
active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely
associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites.
Conclusions: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of
many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of
kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number
changes in the human genome.

Background
Large deletions encompassing the NF1 gene region at
17q11.2 are present in 5 to 10% of patients with neuro-
fibromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM #162200) [1]. The major-
ity of large NF1 deletions have recurrent breakpoints
and are mediated by nonallelic homologous recombin-
ation (NAHR) between various highly homologous du-
plicated sequences located within the NF1 gene region

[2]. Three types of recurrent NAHR-mediated NF1 dele-
tions have been identified, distinguishable by virtue of
the locations of their breakpoints. Most frequent are
type-1 NF1 deletions of 1.4 Mb, with breakpoints located
within low-copy repeats termed NF1-REPa and NF1-
REPc [3-5]. It is estimated that 70 to 80% of all large NF1
deletions are type-1 [6,7]. Less frequent are the type-2
NF1 deletions, which span 1.2 Mb and have their break-
points located within the SUZ12 gene and its pseudogene
SUZ12P. NAHR between SUZ12 and SUZ12P gives rise
to type-2 NF1 deletions, which are observed in 10 to 20%

of all large NF1 deletions [6,8]. By contrast, type-3 NF1
deletions, which are characterized by breakpoints located
within NF1-REPb and NF1-REPc [7,9,10], are rare, ac-
counting for only 1.4 to 4% of all large NF1 deletions [6,7].
All three types of NF1 deletion (that is, type-1, 2 and 3)
are considered to exhibit recurrent breakpoints that occur
preferentially within genomic regions encompassing only
a few kilobases. In particular, type-1 NF1 deletions are
characterized by pronounced breakpoint recurrence, with
an estimated 80% of all type-1 deletions exhibiting break-
points located within an NAHR hotspot termed PRS2,
which spans 2 kb [11,12]. The existence of a recom-
bination hotspot such as PRS2 is noteworthy since the
recombining low-copy repeats, NF1-REPa and NF1-REPc,
exhibit high sequence homology over an extended region
encompassing approximately 50 kb.

In addition to NF1 deletions with recurrent breakpoints
mediated by NAHR between low-copy repeats, a number
of NF1 deletions have been identified that appear to ex-
hibit non-recurrent breakpoints. These so-called ‘atypical
NF1 deletions’ tend to be heterogeneous in terms of their
size and the number of genes located within the deleted
region. An estimated 8 to 10% of all large NF1 deletions
are atypical [6,7]. However, of the atypical NF1 deletions
reported to date, only 6 have been characterized at the

highest level of resolution so as to reveal the precise loca-
tions of the deletion breakpoints (Tables S1 and S2 in
Additional file 1). None of these 6 deletions exhibited ex-
tended sequence homologies or additional rearrangements
at their breakpoints, suggesting that non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) had been responsible for mediating them.
Owing to the small number of atypical NF1 deletions so
far characterized, it is unclear whether other mutational
mechanisms are also involved. In this study, we identified
and characterized the precise breakpoints of 17 atypical
NF1 deletions and found that a variety of different muta-
tional mechanisms,
including replication-based mecha-
nisms involving multiple template switching events and a
novel SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA)
insertion-associated mechanism, are responsible for their
occurrence.

Results
Custom-designed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amp-
lification (MLPA) and targeted array comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) were performed to identify the
breakpoint regions of the 17 atypical NF1 deletions span-
ning between 519 kb and 5.9 Mb (Figure 1). Breakpoint-
spanning PCRs, using the Expand Long Template PCR
system under standard conditions with primers designed

on the basis of the array CGH results, were successful in
the case of 15 of the 17 atypical NF1 deletions. Sequence
analysis of the corresponding PCR products provided the
precise breakpoint locations of the 15 deletions that exhib-
ited simple breakpoints with readily interpretable transi-
tions from centromeric to telomeric breakpoint-flanking
sequences. Short microinsertions, of 9, 10 and 11 bp, re-
spectively, were observed at the breakpoints of 3 of the 15
deletions (Table 1). These microinsertions were homolo-
gous to sequences located in the immediate vicinity of
the breakpoint-flanking regions. Hence, the short micro-
insertions are likely to have been mediated by replication-
associated template switching, which will also have
caused the large NF1 deletions identified in these patients
(Figures S1 to S3 in Additional file 1). Microhomologies
of between 1 bp and 52 bp were observed at the break-
points of 13 of the 15 deletions, whereas 4 of these 13 de-
letions exhibited microhomologies ≥ 6 bp (Table 1). Single
nucleotide changes (SNCs) in relation to the human gen-
ome reference sequence that do not represent known
polymorphisms (that is, not present in dbSNP) were iden-
tified in the breakpoint-flanking regions of 4 of the 15
deletions (Table 1; Figure S4 in Additional file 1). The
breakpoints of 3 of the 15 atypical NF1 deletions with sim-
ple breakpoints were located within Alu elements that
exhibited pairwise sequence homologies between 79 and
89% (Table 1), suggestive of Alu-mediated NAHR being
the potential mechanism underlying the corresponding
deletions.

Analysis of deletion breakpoint-flanking regions
We investigated whether non-B DNA-forming sequence
motifs as well as direct and inverted repeats were over-
represented in the breakpoint-flanking regions of the 15
atypical NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints. To this
end, we determined their frequency within a 300 bp frag-
ment flanking each deletion breakpoint (that is, 150 bp on
both sides). Non-B DNA-forming sequences were identi-
fied within 53% of the deletion breakpoint-flanking frag-
ments (Tables S3 to S5 in Additional file 1). Similarly,
direct and inverted repeats in the size range of ≥ 6 bp up
to 150 bp, as identified by MEME Suite sequence analysis
tools, were detected in 77% of the deletion breakpoint-
flanking regions (Table S6 in Additional file 1). However,
when compared with a control sequence dataset, no over-
representation of either non-B DNA-forming sequence
motifs or direct and inverted repeats was detectable within
the deletion breakpoint-flanking regions (Tables S5 and S6
in Additional file 1).

To determine the frequency of repeats > 150 bp cap-
able of forming DNA secondary structures and located
within the breakpoint-flanking regions of 15 of the atyp-
ical NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints, we screened
2 kb sequences flanking the deletion breakpoints on

either side by means of BLASTN self-alignments. Only 5
of the 15 deletion breakpoint-flanking regions harbored
repeats in the size range of 244 to 316 bp (Table S7 in
Additional file 1). As compared with a control dataset, the
number of repeats was not found to be overrepresented in
the deletion breakpoint-flanking regions (P = 0.99, two-
tailed Fisher’s exact test; Tables S8 and S9 in Additional
file 1). We also searched for large direct and inverted re-
peats (≥ 1 kb) located within 20 kb regions flanking the
deletion breakpoints on either side by means of BLASTN
alignments. A 5.7 kb inverted repeat exhibiting 99% se-
quence homology was identified that harbored one of the
deletion breakpoints in patient 619. Remarkably, one of
the breakpoints of another atypical NF1 deletion (in pa-
tient 659) was located only 2.7 kb telomeric to one of
the breakpoints in patient 619 and between both
5.7 kb repeats (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). These
inverted repeats were the only direct and inverted re-
peat sequences ≥ 1 kb identified in the vicinity of the
breakpoints of the 15 atypical NF1 deletions (Table S10 in
Additional file 1). We suspect that these 5.7 kb inverted
repeats located within NF1-REPa may have contributed
to the occurrence of the atypical NF1 deletions by medi-
ating the formation of a hairpin structure, thereby indu-
cing DNA double strand breaks underlying the deletions
(Figure S5 in Additional file 1).

We also investigated whether SINEs and LINEs span-
ning the breakpoints, or located immediately adjacent to
the breakpoints, might be overrepresented at the break-
points of the 15 atypical NF1 deletions with simple break-
points as compared with a control dataset of sequences.
When the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints of
the 15 atypical NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints
were considered, SINEs or LINEs were located at or im-
mediately adjacent to 22 of the 30 breakpoints (73%).
However, the number of SINEs and LINEs located at the
NF1 deletion breakpoints was not significantly elevated as
compared with a control sequence dataset (Table S11 in
Additional file 1).

SVA element insertions at the deletion breakpoints in two
patients
In contrast to the aforementioned 15 deletions with sim-
ple breakpoints, breakpoint-spanning PCRs were not
successful under standard conditions in 2 of the 17 atyp-
ical NF1 deletions investigated. However, a combination
of semi-specific PCR, inverse PCR and PCR analysis of
somatic cell hybrids made it possible to narrow down
the deletion breakpoint regions in patient DA-77 as
schematically indicated in Figures S6 and S7 (Additional
file 1). GenomeWalker analysis of the breakpoint regions
in this patient then revealed the insertion of an SINE/
VNTR/Alu (SVA) retrotransposon, which is absent from
the human genome reference sequence (hg19), at the

aIndicated are the genomic positions of the centromeric breakpoints and, in parentheses, the positions of the telomeric breakpoints (hg19). The indicated genomic positions correspond to the nucleotides immediately
before and immediately after the deleted DNA sequence. Where microhomology (100% sequence identity) was present at the deletion breakpoints, the position of the centromeric breakpoint was defined as the last
nucleotide adjacent to the region of microhomology whilst the position of the telomeric breakpoint was defined as the first nucleotide adjacent to the region of microhomology.
bIndicated are the numbers of nucleotides exhibiting microhomology at the corresponding breakpoints. Microhomology was defined as one or more perfectly matching basepairs.
cPlus signs indicate single nucleotide changes (SNCs) identified within the breakpoint-flanking regions (±75 bp) of the patients but absent from the reference sequence of the human genome (hg19). Where an SNC
was identified within the breakpoint-flanking sequence, a replication-based mechanism (RBM) was considered to have been responsible for causing the SNC as well as the large NF1 deletion. Dashes indicate that SNCs
were not detected in the respective breakpoint-flanking sequences.
dSINEs and LINEs spanning the breakpoints were identified by means of the Repeat Masker track of the UCSC Genome Browser (date: 04.11.2013). Indicated are the Alu elements that were located at both breakpoints
and in direct orientation with respect to each other. Dashes denote that directly oriented SINEs or LINEs located at both breakpoints and harboring the respective deletion breakpoints at homologous positions were
not identified.
eIndicated is the homology between the Alu elements as well as the length of the Alu sequences exhibiting the indicated homology.
fNHEJ, non-homologous end joining; MMEJ, microhomology-mediated end joining; Alu-mediated NAHR,Alu-mediated nonallelic homologous end joining; RBM, replication-based mechanisms such as fork stalling and
template-switching (FoSTeS) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR). SVA insertion, SVA insertion-associated deletion.
The deletions in patients 100206 and 61541 may have been mediated by either NHEJ or RBM. In both patients, SNCs were detected in breakpoint-flanking regions suggestive of the involvement of a low-fidelity DNA
polymerase and a RBM. However, the involvement of NHEJ in the occurrence of these deletions cannot be excluded. In addition, the deletions identified in patients R84239, 70969 and 619 may have been caused by either
NHEJ or RBM. The microinsertions identified at the breakpoints exhibit homology to sequences closely flanking the breakpoints and hence could have been caused by multiple template switching events indicative of a
replication-based mechanism. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the microinsertions occurred at random and that the deletions were mediated by NHEJ.
The deletion identified in patient D06.1047 may have been mediated by MMEJ since microhomology > 5 bp is indicative of MMEJ [29]. However, microhomology has also been observed at rearrangement breakpoints
mediated by a replication-based mechanism and hence the deletion in this patient could also have been caused by an RBM.
In the case of patients 659, 1106 and D0801587, several mechanisms (Alu-mediated NAHR, MMEJ or RBM) could have caused the respective deletions. We observed directly oriented Alu elements at the deletion
breakpoints of all three patients. Hence, the deletions may have been caused by Alu-mediated NAHR. Alternatively, the deletions could have been caused by MMEJ or RBM since microhomologies of 20 to 52 bp were
observed at the breakpoints.
gThe centromeric deletion breakpoint in patient 659 is located within intron 7 of the LRRC37Bpseudogene in NF1-REPa whereas the telomeric breakpoint is located within intron 2 of the functional LRRC37B gene
located in NF1-REPc. The breakpoints of the deletion in patient 659 do not overlap with the nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) hotspots of type-1 NF1 deletions, termed PRS1 and PRS2. Hence, this atypical
NF1 deletion is not considered to exhibit recurrent breakpoints located within regions of extended sequence homology.
hThe grandmother of patient DA-77 exhibits somatic mosaicism since she possesses cells harboring the deletion alongside normal cells. Her granddaughter, patient DA-77, harbors the deletion in all of her cells.

corresponding genomic position (Figure S6 in Additional
file 1). SVA elements are composite retrotransposons
that vary in size from 700 bp up to 4 kb [13,14]. In order
to amplify across the inserted SVA element and the dele-
tion breakpoints, we performed PCR using primers with a
high melting-temperature and PCR conditions optimized
to amplify GC-rich sequences (Figure S8 and Table S12 in
Additional file 1). The application of an optimized PCR
protocol was necessary since SVA elements contain a vari-
able number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) region that is ex-
tremely GC-rich and can extend over several hundred
basepairs. Sequence analysis of the resulting PCR product
indicated that the inserted SVA spans 1.7 kb and exhibits
99% sequence homology to its probable source element
H10_1 located on chromosome 10q24.2 (Figure 2; Figure
S9 in Additional file 1). H10_1 is known to be one of the
most retrotranspositionally active SVA source elements so
far identified in the human genome [13,15]. This source
element belongs to the evolutionarily youngest subfamily of
SVA elements (SVA_F1) and encompasses a VNTR region
of 2,093 bp with a GC-content of 79% (Figure 2; Figure S10
in Additional file 1). Compared with its source element
H10_1, the SVA element inserted at the deletion breakpoint
of patient DA-77 is truncated at its 5′ end (Figure 2).

PCR-based techniques designed to identify unknown
DNA sequence inserted at deletion breakpoints also
facilitated the analysis of the atypical NF1 deletion iden-
tified in patient ASB4-55 (Figures S11 and S12 in
Additional file 1). Inverse and semi-specific PCR indi-
cated that the centromeric deletion breakpoint was lo-
cated immediately adjacent to a polyT(40) tract that is
present in patient ASB4-55 but absent from the reference
sequence of human chromosome 17 at the corresponding
genomic position. Under the assumption that an SVA in-
sertion could also have occurred in patient ASB4-55 at
the breakpoint of the large NF1 deletion that was also
refractory to analysis by breakpoint-spanning PCR under
standard conditions, we performed breakpoint-spanning
PCRs under conditions optimized to amplify across se-
quences with a high GC-content (Table S12 in Additional
file 1). By these means, we successfully amplified across
the deletion breakpoints, and sequence analysis of the
PCR product confirmed the insertion of a SVA element in
this patient as well (Figure S13 in Additional file 1). BLAT
sequence alignments against the human genome refer-
ence sequence indicated that the inserted SVA exhib-
ited maximum (99.5%) sequence homology to the SVA_F
element H6_1084 located on chromosome 6q22.31, which
was therefore deemed most likely to be the source
element of the SVA inserted at the deletion breakpoint
in patient ASB4-55. Whereas full-length H6_1084 spans
2.69 kb, the copy inserted at the deletion breakpoint
in patient ASB4-55 spans only 1.3 kb and is 5′-truncated
(Figure 2; Figures S14 and S15 in Additional file 1).

Remarkably, the sites of the two SVA insertions within
SUZ12P intron 8,
identified in patients ASB4-55 and
DA-77, are separated by only 3,067 bp. SVA elements are
thought to integrate within genomic sequences via target-
primed reverse transcription (TPRT) mediated by the
LINE 1 protein machinery [16-19]. One of the hallmarks
of L1-mediated retrotransposition of SVAs is that they
often integrate at DNA sites resembling the L1 endo-
nuclease consensus cleavage sites such as 5′-TTTT/A-3′
or 5′-CTTT/A-3′ [20]. The SVA elements we identified
within SUZ12P intron 8 most likely integrated via TPRT
since L1 endonuclease cleavage sites 5′-CTTT/A-3′ were
detected at the corresponding integration sites within
SUZ12P intron 8 (Figures S16 and S17 in Additional
file 1). Furthermore, long polyT tracts were noted at the
integration sites; such tracts also represent hallmarks of
L1-mediated TPRT (Figures S9 and S15 in Additional
file 1). Both SVA elements identified at the deletion break-
points of patients DA-77 and ASB4-55 were inserted into
the plus strands within SUZ12P intron 8. The telomeric
breakpoints of the deletions in patients DA-77 and ASB4-
55 are separated by 132 kb; whereas the deletion in patient
DA-77 encompasses 1,001,546 bp, the deletion in patient
ASB4-55 spans 866,769 bp.

Patient ASB4-55 exhibited somatic mosaicism, with
93% of her blood cells harboring the deletion and 7% lack-
ing the deletion (Table S13 in Additional file 1). Somatic
mosaicism was also detected in the grandmother of pa-
tient DA-77 who passed on the atypical NF1 deletion to
her offspring (Figures S18 and S19 in Additional file 1).
FISH analysis of blood cells from the grandmother of pa-
tient DA-77 indicated that 75% of her blood cells har-
bored the deletion whereas 25% were normal. The SVA
insertion at the deletion breakpoints was confirmed by
breakpoint-spanning PCR using DNA from the grand-
mother and the cousins of patient DA-77 (Figures S8 and
S19 in Additional file 1).

Neither of the SVA elements identified at the NF1 de-
letion breakpoints appeared to be a frequent insertion/
deletion polymorphism within SUZ12P intron 8 as de-
termined by PCR analysis of DNA samples derived from
100 healthy control individuals (Figures S20 and S22 and
Table S14 in Additional file 1). Further, these SVA ele-
ments identified within SUZ12P intron 8 are not listed
in the database of polymorphic retrotransposons, dbRIP
[21], nor were they reported as SVA insertion polymor-
phisms in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset [22].

In order to confirm that the SVA insertions occurred
de novo within SUZ12P intron 8 in patient ASB4-55 and
the grandmother of patient DA-77, and to establish whether
or not these insertions occurred prior to the somatic
NF1 deletion, we performed PCR and SNP analysis using
blood-derived DNA from the patients. These analyses
did not indicate the presence of the SVA insertion in

Figure 2 Structure of the SVA elements inserted at the NF1 deletion breakpoints and their source elements. (A) The SVA_F1 element
H10_1 spans 4,039 bp and is the likely source element of the SVA copy that inserted within SUZ12P intron 8 in the grandmother of
patient DA-77. Starting at its 5′ end, H10_1 comprises a target site duplication (TSD), a transduced sequence (5′TD) and a full-length
AluSc from chromosome 9p13.3, a transduced partial exon 1 of MAST2, an Alu-like region, a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region,
a SINE-R, a polyA(17) tract, the second TSD, an AluSp element, a second polyA(17) tract and a non-repetitive, unique sequence resulting
from a 3′ transduction that harbors two polyadenylation signals (AATAAA). The size of each region is given in basepairs. (B) A copy of
the source element H10_1 integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in the grandmother of patient DA-77. The SVA insertion was associated with a deletion
of approximately 1 Mb. The inserted SVA spans 1.7 kb and is 5′ truncated. (C) Structure of the putative source SVA element H6_1084, which
spans 2,691 bp and belongs to the SVA_F subfamily. A copy of H6_1084 is presumed to have integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in patient
ASB4-55. Full-length H6_1084 has the following structure starting from the 5′ end: a TSD, a 5′TD from chromosome 12p11.21, a CCCTCT(4) repeat, a
343-bp Alu-like region, a GC-rich VNTR region, a SINE-R element, two polyadenylation signals, a polyA(11) tract and the second TSD. The length of each
region is indicated in basepairs. (D) Structure of the 5′ truncated copy of H6_1084 that has integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in patient ASB4-55. The
SVA insertion was associated with an atypical NF1 deletion of 867 kb. The SVA integration sites within SUZ12P intron 8 demarcate the centromeric
breakpoints of the atypical NF1 deletions.

the absence of the large NF1 deletion (Figures S20 to S23
and Table S15 in Additional file 1). Hence, we conclude
that in both patients, the atypical NF1 deletions occurred
concomitantly with the SVA insertions during early post-
zygotic development.

Somatic mosaicism
In addition to the mosaicism noted in patient ASB4-55
and in the grandmother of patient DA-77, a further eight
of the 17 atypical NF1 deletions investigated were found
to exhibit somatic mosaicism (Table S13 in Additional
file 1). Thus, taken together, at least 10 of the 17 atypical
NF1 deletions (59%) were of postzygotic origin.

Location of the atypical NF1 deletion breakpoints
The 17 atypical NF1 deletions investigated here exhib-
ited considerable differences in terms of their sizes and
breakpoint locations (Figure 1). Nevertheless, the majority
of the breakpoints were found to be located within the
genomic region flanked by NF1-REPa and NF1-REPc.
Only two deletions, those harbored by patients 619 and
D05.2678, exhibited breakpoints telomeric to NF1-REPc
(located 1.53 Mb and 3.69 Mb distal to NF1-REPc). If
these two deletions are excluded from consideration, the
telomeric breakpoints of all of the remaining 15 atypical
NF1 deletions were located within a 615-kb region be-
tween RAB11FIP4 and NF1-REPc (Figure 3). Remarkably,
5 of these 15 deletions had telomeric breakpoints located
within a 32.6 kb stretch, indicative of an overrepresenta-
tion of breakpoints within this genomic region (Table S16
in Additional file 1; P < 0.0001). In addition, the centro-
meric breakpoints of the atypical NF1 deletions investi-
gated were found to be preferentially located within a
specific genomic region: 11 deletions exhibited centro-
meric breakpoints located within SUZ12P, thereby indicat-
ing an overrepresentation of such breakpoints within 39 kb
of SUZ12P sequence (Figure 4; Table S17 in Additional
file 1; P < 0.0001). However, a clustering of these 11 dele-
tion breakpoints within a specific region of SUZ12P encom-
passing only a few hundred basepairs was not observed
(Table S18 in Additional file 1). This notwithstanding,
the centromeric breakpoints of the unrelated patients
located within SUZ12P intron 4,
Ak-45077 and 61541,
are separated by 10 bp (Table 1; Table S18 in Additional
file 1). It should be noted that the breakpoints of the
recurrent type-2 NF1 deletions are also located within
SUZ12P [23]. Although atypical NF1 deletions do not
appear to be mediated by NAHR between segmental du-
plications, on the basis that extended sequence homology
between the centromeric and telomeric deletion break-
points was not evident, we noted that two of the atypical
NF1 deletions investigated exhibited breakpoints that
overlapped with the breakpoints of type-2 NF1 dele-
tions (Table S18 in Additional
file 1). The reasons

why the centromeric breakpoints of the atypical NF1
deletions accumulate within SUZ12P are currently un-
known. No overrepresentation of non-B DNA forming se-
quences, short repeats identified by MEME Suite analysis,
or repeats >150 bp was observed in the regions flank-
ing the breakpoints within SUZ12P as compared with a
control sequence dataset (Tables S19 to 21 in Additional
file 1).

Discussion
This study has provided a body of evidence to support the
view that atypical NF1 deletions are not only heterogeneous
in terms of their size but also heterogeneous in relation
to their underlying mutational mechanisms. Sequence
analysis of
the deletion breakpoints suggested that
replication- and recombination-based mechanisms as well
as non-replicative repair and retrotransposon-associated
mutagenesis are involved in the formation of these dele-
tions. Fifteen of the 17 atypical NF1 deletions investigated
exhibited ‘simple’ breakpoints that
lacked microinser-
tions >11 bp at the breakpoint junctions (Table 1). Micro-
homologies ranging from 1 bp to 52 bp were detected at
the breakpoints of 13 of these 15 atypical NF1 deletions
with simple breakpoints. Other non-recurrent disease-
causing gross deletions have also been reported to exhibit
breakpoint microhomologies at high frequency [24-26].
In our study, the majority of the atypical NF1 deletions
(10/17) exhibited short regions of microhomology (1 to
4 bp). We assume that some of these deletions with
simple breakpoints and short regions of microhomology
may have been mediated by NHEJ, a repair mechanism
that is frequently associated with short microhomologies
at deletion breakpoints although not dependent upon
them (Table 1). By contrast, microhomology >5 bp is
a prerequisite for microhomology-mediated end joining
(MMEJ), an alternative pathway of NHEJ [27-30]. Four
of the atypical NF1 deletions investigated here exhib-
ited microhomologies >5 bp at the breakpoints and hence
may have been mediated by MMEJ. Microhomologies have
also been observed at the breakpoints of non-recurrent
genomic rearrangements mediated by replication-based
mechanisms such as microhomology-mediated break-
induced replication or fork stalling and template switch-
ing [26,31-37]. Hence, replication-based mechanisms may
have been responsible for the atypical NF1 deletions exhi-
biting microhomologies at their breakpoints.

Three of the atypical NF1 deletions investigated here
were characterized by microinsertions at the break-
points of 9, 10 and 11 bp, respectively (Table 1). Sequence
alignment indicated that these microinsertions exhibited
homology to sequences closely flanking the deletion break-
points (Figures S1 to S3 in Additional file 1). We conclude
that these microinsertions probably resulted from serial
template switching events during DNA replication that

also caused the respective atypical large NF1 deletions.
Also indicative of the involvement of replication-based
mechanisms in the formation of some of the atypical NF1
deletions investigated are the SNCs that were observed in
the breakpoint-flanking regions of 4 of the 15 atypical
NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints (27%; Table 1).
These SNCs represent nucleotides that differ from the ref-
erence sequence of the human genome (hg19) but do not
appear to represent polymorphisms since they are not
present in dbSNP. Recently, Carvalho et al. [33] showed
that replicative mechanisms underlying the complex copy
number gains that characterize the MECP2 gene region
are associated with an increased frequency of SNCs in the
breakpoint-flanking regions. SNCs are likely to be caused
by the involvement of low-fidelity DNA polymerases or a
replisome with reduced fidelity [33]. In similar vein, we
postulate that the SNCs observed in the breakpoint-
flanking regions of the atypical NF1 deletions investigated
here were introduced concomitantly with the occurrence
of the large NF1 deletions mediated by replication-based
mechanisms. At the breakpoints of three of the 15 atypical

NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints, directly orientated
Alu elements were located and we surmise that these
three deletions could have been caused by Alu-mediated
nonallelic homologous recombination.

The different types of non-recurrent copy number
change in the human genome are thought to be induced
either by DNA double strand breaks or by secondary
structures whose formation is facilitated by specific se-
quence motifs such as non-B DNA-forming sequences
and direct and inverted repeats [38]. Indeed, non-B DNA-
forming sequences and/or inverted and direct repeats
have been found to be overrepresented at the breakpoints
of numerous human inherited disease-associated rear-
rangements [24,25,32,33,39-47]. This notwithstanding,
we did not observe any overrepresentation of non-B
DNA-forming sequences or direct/inverted repeats within
300 bp regions flanking the breakpoints of the 15 atypical
NF1 deletions with simple breakpoints as compared with
a control dataset of DNA sequences that did not encom-
pass atypical NF1 deletion breakpoints (Tables S3 to S9 in
Additional file 1). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the

possibility that the occurrence of some of the NF1 dele-
tions investigated here may have been facilitated by DNA
secondary structures formed by these repeat sequences.
Remarkably, we identified a 5.7 kb inverted repeat at or
flanking the breakpoints of two unrelated patients with
atypical NF1 deletions (patients 659 and 619). It would
appear likely that this 5.7 kb repeat, which exhibits 99%
sequence identity, is causally associated with the occur-
rence of the corresponding deletions whose breakpoints
are separated by only 2.7 kb (Figure S5 and Table S10 in
Additional file 1).

The breakpoints of the atypical NF1 deletions investi-
gated here turned out to be non-randomly distributed;
indeed, we observed a preponderance of breakpoints within
specific genomic regions (Figures 3 and 4). Most notably,
11 of the 17 deletions (65%) possessed breakpoints that
were located within SUZ12P. The pseudogene SUZ12P
also harbors the breakpoints of the recurrent type-2 NF1
deletions mediated by NAHR. The high frequency of
centromeric deletion breakpoints within SUZ12P suggests
that this genomic region exhibits an unusual degree of
genomic instability. At the outset of this study, we ex-
pected atypical NF1 deletions to be quite heterogeneous

in terms of their size and breakpoint position. It turns out,
however, that although this group of NF1 deletions has
arisen through the action of a number of different muta-
tional mechanisms, the deletion breakpoints exhibit a cer-
tain degree of clustering. This is consistent with the view
that the nature, size and location of human gene muta-
tions are often determined either by specific characteris-
tics of the local DNA sequence environment or by higher
order features of the genomic architecture [38,48].

Intriguingly, SVA element insertions within SUZ12P
intron 8 were observed at the breakpoints of two unre-
lated patients with atypical NF1 deletions (patients DA-77
and ASB4-55). SVA elements are hominid-specific, non-
autonomous, non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons
that originated approximately 25 million years ago [49,50].
SVAs expand in their host genomes through an RNA
intermediate and may integrate via Target-Primed Reverse
Transcription (TPRT), which is mediated in trans by the
L1 protein machinery [16,19]. Several active SVA source
loci in the human genome are known to give rise to new
insertions of SVA elements that may vary in size due
to truncations or transductions at the 5′ or 3′ ends
[13,15,51]. In the current reference sequence of the

Vogt et al. Genome Biology 2014, 15:R80
http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/6/R80

Page 11 of 17

human genome (hg19), 2,676 SVA elements have been
identified, encompassing 0.13% of the genome [52].
The SVA retrotransposition rate in humans has been esti-
mated to be 1 in every 916 births [53,54]. SVAs are divided
into subfamilies A to F1 based on diagnostic mutations,
sequence divergence and evolutionary age [13,15,55]. One
of the most active SVA elements is H10_1, located on
chromosome 10q24.2, which has been identified as the
source element of at least 13 further SVA_F1 elements in
the human genome [13,15]. In our study, a 5′-truncated
copy of H10_1 was detected at the deletion breakpoints of
patient DA-77. The SVA insertion and the associated
atypical NF1 deletion had occurred de novo in the grand-
mother of patient DA-77 who exhibited somatic mosai-
cism with normal cells (Figures S18 and S19 in Additional
file 1). The inserted SVA copy spans 1.7 kb, and hence
had been reduced in size compared with the 4 kb H10_1
source element (Figure 2). Remarkably, patient ASB4-55
also possessed a de novo insertion of a 5′ truncated SVA
element at the breakpoints of the atypical NF1 deletion
identified in this individual. The source element of this
inserted SVA is likely to be H6_1084, which also belongs
to the SVA_F subfamily but is located on chromosome
6q22.31 (Figure 2). The insertion of both SVA elements
within SUZ12P intron 8 is likely to have been mediated
by TPRT since long polyT tracts and sequences with
homology to L1 endonuclease cleavage sites were both ob-
served at the integration sites.

It is noteworthy that at least 10 of the 17 atypical NF1
deletions investigated (59%) exhibited somatic mosaicism
with normal cells. Hence, it is not only type-2 NF1 dele-
tions that are frequently of postzygotic origin [23,56,57]
but also atypical NF1 deletions. The atypical NF1 deletions
detected in patient ASB4-55 and the grandmother of
patient DA-77 must have occurred during postzygotic
development since both individuals exhibited somatic
mosaicism with normal cells. In neither individual did
PCR experiments detect the presence of cells harbor-
ing the SVA insertion in the absence of the atypical NF1
deletion. Therefore, we may conclude that the SVA inser-
tions are likely to have occurred concomitantly in associ-
ation with the large NF1 deletions during postzygotic cell
division. This is consistent with previous reports demon-
strating that whilst retrotransposition can occur in the
germline, it is also frequent in the soma in various tissues
and developmental stages [58-60], in the brain [61-65]
and during cancer progression [66-69]. According to the
model presented in Figure 5, the SVA insertions within
SUZ12P intron 8 were mediated by TPRT and were asso-
ciated with ligation to sequences located in the telomeric
NF1 gene region, thereby giving rise to the large NF1 dele-
tions. We postulate that a loop-like chromatin conform-
ation may have brought SUZ12P and the region of the
telomeric deletion breakpoint into close proximity. The

physical interaction of these chromosomal regions may
have then potentiated the ligation of the SUZ12P se-
quence, with the inserted SVA element at its end, to
sequences located within the telomeric NF1 gene re-
gion. The ligations were probably potentiated by NHEJ
since proteins of the NHEJ pathway have been shown to
mediate L1 retrotransposition [70]. Importantly, we did
not observe extended sequence homology between the
inserted SVA elements and the telomeric deletion break-
point regions in patients DA-77 and ASB4-55. This strongly
suggests that the deletions arose concomitantly with the
retrotransposition events as opposed to being mediated by
secondary nonallelic homologous recombination events.
We speculate that the insertion of the SVA elements trig-
gered the occurrence of the large NF1 deletions according
to the model proposed in Figure 5.

Previous studies have suggested the existence of retro-
transposon insertion hotspots in the human genome
[22,71-73]. This conceptual view is also supported by
our observation of two de novo SVA insertions within
SUZ12P intron 8 separated by only 3 kb. Moreover, our
findings suggest that the increased genomic instability
manifested by SUZ12P not only causes recurrent type-2
and atypical NF1 deletions, but may also facilitate the in-
tegration of SVA mRNA intermediates.

The SVA insertion-associated NF1 deletions identified
in the family of patient DA-77 and in patient ASB4-55
encompassed 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively. These dele-
tions are unprecedentedly large since, until now, only
much smaller deletions (up to 46 kb) have been reported
in association with pathogenic non-long terminal repeat
(LTR) retrotransposon insertion-associated deletions in
the human genome (Table 2). Thus, in a comparison of
the human and chimpanzee genomes, Lee et al. [74] iden-
tified 13 human-specific SVA insertion-associated dele-
tions ranging from 14 bp up to 8.7 kb in length (Table S22
in Additional file 1). HeLa cell culture studies using an
in vitro L1 recovery system have documented the occur-
rence of a genomic deletion >71 kb associated with the
insertion of an L1 element [75]. Thus, although large
genomic deletions can in principle be mediated by a
retrotransposon insertion-associated mechanism, this has
until now not been reported in association with SVA in-
sertion. Our findings imply that SVA insertion-associated
large genomic deletions encompassing several hundred ki-
lobases could represent a novel type of pathogenic (and
conceivably also non-pathogenic) copy number change.
At present, however, it is not possible to estimate the fre-
quency of non-LTR retrotransposon insertion-associated
large deletions causing human disease because this type of
rearrangement is likely to have gone undetected in many
studies.

Owing to their repetitive nature, SVA and other retrotrans-
poson insertions at deletion breakpoints are undetectable by

Figure 5 Putative mechanism underlying the large atypical NF1 deletions identified in patient ASB4-55 and the grandmother of patient
DA-77. The deletions were associated with the insertion of an SVA element mediated by the LINE 1 protein machinery via target-primed reverse
transcription. (A) SUZ12P intron 8 is indicated in lilac whereas the telomeric part of the NF1 region is shown in green. The dotted lines indicate
the approximately 1-Mb distance between these two regions. The SVA insertion within SUZ12P intron 8 is likely to have been initiated by the L1
endonuclease (L1-EN), which will have introduced a nick at the consensus cleavage site 5′-CTTT/A-3′. (B) Next, the SVA mRNA annealed to the
T-overhang by means of its polyA-tail. Then, the L1 reverse transcriptase used the SVA mRNA as a template for reverse transcription to synthesize
the SVA cDNA (blue). Second strand cleavage by the L1-EN occurred upstream of the first-strand cleavage site. Independently, a double strand
break (DSB) occurred in the telomeric region of 17q11.2. (C,D) After dissociation of the SVA mRNA, the integration process was not finalized by
recombinational repair using the downstream SUZ12P intron 8 sequence. Instead, the DNA ends were ligated by NHEJ to the open-ended DNA
sequence located within the telomeric 17q11.2 region, between the RAB11FIP4 and COPRS genes, which resulted in the deletion of the intervening
sequence and hence the occurrence of the atypical NF1 deletion (D).

array CGH. Furthermore, specially optimized PCR assays are
necessary to detect the GC-rich SVA elements at deletion
breakpoints because long GC-rich sequences are refractory
to analysis by breakpoint-spanning PCRs performed under
standard conditions. It follows that the incidence of SVA
insertion-mediated deletions may well have been seriously
underestimated in human genome pathology. Since the ret-
rotransposition of non-LTR retro-elements occurs in the
germline, early embryonic development, and in somatic
cells [60-62], retrotransposon insertion-associated deletions
are likely to occur in all three contexts.

Conclusion
It has been known for some time that retrotransposons
can cause human disease by inactivating genes through

insertional mutagenesis [66,71,86,87]. Our findings indi-
cate that retrotransposon insertions may also exert their
influence in a pathogenic context aggravated by accom-
panying large genomic deletions that encompass many
hundreds of kilobases leading to the loss of multiple
dosage-sensitive genes.

of Ulm University (application number 129/09) and the
Hamburg Medical Association (PV3291) and we adhered
to their rules. Either the patients or their parents gave
their informed consent to the molecular characterization
of the deletions. High-molecular-weight DNA samples ex-
tracted from blood of the patients were analyzed in order
to identify the breakpoint locations.

Custom-designed MLPA and array CGH
To determine the positions of the deletion breakpoints
more precisely, we performed custom-designed MLPA
analysis with probes established previously (Table S25
in Additional file 1) [23]. By means of this analysis, the
breakpoint regions could be assigned to intervals of a few
tens of kilobases (Table S26 in Additional file 1). Next,
we performed targeted array CGH using 8 × 15 K arrays
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with probes
located within the deletion breakpoint regions as predicted
by the MLPA analyses. This array CGH probe-set included
4,891 control probes as well as 10,853 test probes. The de-
tails of probe design, as well as the analysis of the array,
are described in Figure S24 (Additional file 1).

Breakpoint identification by PCR
Breakpoint-spanning PCRs were performed using the
Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). The locations of the PCR primers were se-
lected on the basis of the array CGH results (Table S27
in Additional file 1). The resulting PCR products were
gel-purified (Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit, Zymo
Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and sequenced with the
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Life
Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Sequence alignments
of
the

the breakpoint-spanning PCR products against

reference sequence of the human genome (hg19) indicated
the precise locations of the respective deletion breakpoints.

Somatic cell hybrids and PCR analysis
Hybrid cell lines harboring only the chromosome 17 with
the deletion were established for patients 659, 619, 1106,
DA-77 and ASB4-55 using Epstein-Barr virus-transformed
cell lines according to the procedure described previously
[8]. Using DNA isolated from the hybrid cell lines, we per-
formed PCR and sequence analysis of the respective prod-
ucts in order to narrow down the locations of the deletion
breakpoints.

(Additional file 1), was performed with the restriction en-
zymes and PCR primers listed in Tables S28 and S29
(Additional file 1). Semi-specific PCRs, employed accord-
ing to the principle described in Figure S26 (Additional
file 1), were performed with primers summarized in
Tables S30 and S31 (Additional file 1). PCR products
obtained from these assays were then investigated by
sequence analysis. To perform GenomeWalker™ analysis
(Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France), genomic DNA
(2.5 μg per experiment) was restriction digested and adap-
tors were ligated to the DNA fragments. Subsequently,
PCR was performed with an adaptor-specific primer in
combination with a primer located close to the breakpoint
regions (Figure S27 in Additional file 1). PCRs were per-
formed with the Advantage® 2 PCR Kit (Clontech). The

corresponding PCR products were gel-purified (S.N.A.P.™
UV-Free Gel Purification Kit, Invitrogen, USA) and cloned
for sequence analyses. The restriction enzymes used for
each experiment, together with the region-specific primers,
are listed in Tables S32 and S33 (Additional file 1).

Analysis of the breakpoint-flanking sequences
Two datasets of sequences were analyzed in order to in-
vestigate whether non-B DNA-forming sequences, direct
and inverted repeats ≥ 6 bp, or retrotransposons were
overrepresented in the regions flanking the atypical NF1
deletion breakpoints. The dataset of deletion breakpoint-
flanking sequences included 150 bp located centromeric
and 150 bp located telomeric to each deletion break-
point (Table S3 in Additional file 1). The control dataset
included sequences that did not flank any known atyp-
ical NF1 deletion breakpoints; these control sequences
were located within 17q11.2, telomeric to SUZ12P (gen-
omic region: 29,118,000-29,148,000; hg19) and between
RAB11FIP4 and COPRS (30,020,000-30,050,000; hg19).
In total, the control dataset encompassed 60 kb of gen-
omic DNA subdivided into 200 fragments of 300 bp each.
Within each 300 bp fragment, a hypothetical breakpoint
was assigned a location between nucleotides 150 and 151
(Table S4 in Additional file 1). This control dataset, as well
as the breakpoint-flanking sequences of the NF1 deletions,
were screened for the presence of non-B DNA sequence
motifs (Tables S3 and S4 in Additional file 1). To this end,
we used the non-B DNA database and the non-B DNA
Motif Search Tool under preset search criteria for direct
repeats (length: 10 to 150 bp, separated by < 10 bp) and
inverted repeats (length: 6 to 150 bp, separated by
<100 bp) [88]. In addition, we screened both datasets for
the presence of direct and inverted repeats using the
MEME suite software [89], which detects repeats irre-
spective of whether or not they are capable of forming
non-B DNA structures. The repeats considered had a
minimum length of 6 bp with no restriction being placed
upon the number of nucleotides between the repeats.

Both datasets were also investigated for the presence of
retrotransposons by means of the UCSC Repeat Masker
track [90] (Tables S3 and S4 in Additional file 1).

In order to search for direct and inverted repeats >150 bp
exhibiting ≥ 87% sequence homology within 2 kb regions
flanking the deletion breakpoint regions, we performed
BLASTN [91] self-alignments of the respective regions.
The number of such repeats was also determined in a
control dataset of sequences derived from two genomic
regions: one located telomeric to SUZ12P (genomic pos-
ition: 29,118,000-29,210,000; 92 kb), the other between
RAB11FIP4 and COPRS (genomic position: 30,020,000-
30,048,000; 28 kb). In total, these two regions comprised
120 kb of genomic DNA, which were subdivided into
30 fragments of 4 kb each. Hypothetical breakpoints

were assigned locations between nucleotides at positions
2,000 and 2,001 of each of these 4 kb fragments. BLASTN
alignments of 20 kb regions flanking the deletion break-
points were performed to determine the occurrence of
direct and inverted repeats ≥ 1 kb exhibiting ≥ 87%
sequence homology.

Somatic mosaicism
Mosaicism of normal cells and cells harboring the NF1
deletion was sought in eight NF1 patients by FISH analysis
of blood lymphocytes cultivated for 72 h in the presence
of phytohaemagglutinin. In each case, at least 200 inter-
phase nuclei were analyzed. When buccal cells were avail-
able for FISH analysis, approximately 100 interphase
nuclei were evaluated. Mosaicism was also investigated by
microsatellite marker analysis of DNA isolated from per-
ipheral blood samples as described previously [8] and by
PCR and sequence analysis of the insertion/deletion poly-
morphism rs17884042.

Availability of data
The microarray datasets are available from the Gene
Expression Omnibus [92], accession number GSE57859.
