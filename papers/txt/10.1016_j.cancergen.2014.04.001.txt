Mutations in the SMARCB1 gene are involved in several human tumor-predisposing syndromes.
They were established as an underlying cause of the tumor suppressor syndrome schwannoma-
tosis in 2008. There is a much higher rate of mutation detection in familial disease than in spo-
radic disease. We have performed extensive genetic testing on a cohort of familial and sporadic
patients who fulﬁlled clinical diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis. In our updated cohort, we
identiﬁed novel mutations within the SMARCB1 gene as well as several recurrent mutations. Of
the schwannomatosis screens reported to date,
including those in our updated cohort,
SMARCB1 mutations have been found in 45% of familial probands and 9% of sporadic patients.
The exon 1 mutation, c.41C>A p.Pro14His (10% in our series), and the 3
untranslated region
mutation, c.*82C>T (27%), are the most common changes reported in patients with schwanno-
portions of the
matosis to date, indicating the presence of mutation hot spots at both 5
gene. Comparison with germline SMARCB1 mutations in patients with rhabdoid tumors showed
that the schwannomatosis mutations were signiﬁcantly more likely to occur at either end of the
gene and be nontruncating mutations (P < 0.0001). SMARCB1 mutations are found in a signif-
icant proportion of schwannomatosis patients, and an even higher proportion of rhabdoid
patients. Whereas SMARCB1 alone seems to account for rhabdoid disease, there is likely to
be substantial heterogeneity in schwannomatosis even for familial disease. There is a clear gen-
otypeephenotype correlation, with germline rhabdoid mutations being signiﬁcantly more likely to
be centrally placed, involve multiple exon deletions, and be truncating mutations.

Schwannomatosis is a member of
the neuroﬁbromatosis
family of inherited tumor predisposition syndromes charac-
terized by the development of multiple nerve sheath tumors.
In schwannomatosis,
these tumors are benign, non-
vestibular, nonintradermal schwannomas, which normally
develop in the second or third decade of life (1). The clinical
phenotype overlaps with that of neuroﬁbromatosis type 2
(NF2), in which multiple schwannomas also frequently occur
on spinal and peripheral nerves. However, the hallmark of
NF2 disease is the development of bilateral vestibular
schwannomas and intradermal schwannomas (2,3), which
are exclusion criteria for a diagnosis of schwannomatosis.

Meningiomas occur in only approximately 5% of patients
with schwannomatosis, whereas they occur in over 50% of
patients with NF2 disease (4), although meningiomas may be
the only, or ﬁrst, tumor type found in an individual with either
syndrome (5,6). Rare cases of other tumors, such as ma-
lignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and
ependymomas, have also been reported (7,8).

Schwannomatosis normally occurs sporadically, with only
approximately 15% of patients inheriting the disease,
whereas approximately half of NF2 patients have a family
history. Germline NF2 mutations are identiﬁed in the vast
majority of NF2 patients (approximately 93%) through clinical
diagnostic genetic testing, and acquired second-hit muta-
tions are normally identiﬁed in tumors (9,10).

The SMARCB1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the
human SWI/hSNF chromatin remodeling complex, was
identiﬁed as the cause of schwannomatosis disease in
2007 (11). Germline SMARCB1 mutations can be found in

374

approximately 50% of inherited cases of schwannomatosis
but only around 10% of sporadic patients (7,8,12,13).

SMARCB1 mutations are also causative of the highly
aggressive pediatric cancer atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors
(AT/RT) (14,15), which has a much more severe phenotype,
in which malignant rhabdoid tumors develop in very young
children and normally lead to death within the ﬁrst few years
of life.

It has been reported that in rare cases schwannomatosis
can occur in mutation carriers from AT/RT families who have
survived to adulthood without developing rhabdoid tumors
(16e18), although these tumors seem to be “neuroblastoma-
like” schwannomas rather than the classic schwannomas
seen in schwannomatosis. It is interesting that mutations in
the same gene can lead to these two conditions with such
different prognoses, and it is possible that this is due to dif-
ferences in their mutation spectra and mutation location
within the gene. Therefore, we now provide an update on the
SMARCB1 mutations found in schwannomatosis and AT/RT
patients screened through the Genomic Diagnostics Labo-
ratory at St. Mary’s Hospital in Manchester since 2011 and
correlate the mutation spectrum found in the worldwide
literature with reports of germline mutations in AT/RT.

Materials and methods

Schwannomatosis and AT/RT patients screened in this study
were referred to the Genomic Diagnostics Laboratory at St.
Mary’s Hospital
in Manchester since December 2011 for
clinical diagnostic mutation analysis. A total of 30 patients
fulﬁlling clinical diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis as
well as 30 AT/RT patients underwent diagnostic mutation
analysis since our previous report (19). All schwannomatosis
patients were found to be negative for germline NF2 muta-
tions in peripheral lymphocyte DNA by direct sequencing of
exons 1e15 of
the NF2 gene and by multiplex ligation-
dependent probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA)
(MRC-Holland,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for copy number analysis as
previously described (8). The cohort included 25 sporadic
patients and ﬁve familial schwannomatosis probands.
Germline DNA from individuals with either schwannomatosis
or AT/RT was analyzed by direct sequencing of all nine
SMARCB1 exons, including the 50e100 bases ﬂanking each
exon to ensure coverage of splice donor and acceptor sites.
MLPA (MRC-Holland P258-B1 probe set) analysis of
SMARCB1 was used to identify exon deletions and dupli-
cations. Tumor DNA was available for testing from seven of
the sporadic schwannomatosis patients. DNA from two tu-
mors was available for two of these patients. Similarly, seven
tumors were available from AT/RT patients. The study was
approved by the North West 7 Research Ethics Commit-
teeeGM Central.

Results

Since our previous report in 2012, a total of 30 probands
fulﬁlling the clinical criteria for schwannomatosis have been
screened by the Genomic Diagnostics Laboratory for muta-
tions in the SMARCB1 gene. Of these patients, 25 were
cases of sporadic disease and ﬁve were from families with
familial schwannomatosis.

Tumor DNA was available for seven sporadic disease
patients, and two tumors were available for two of these.
Neither of these showed evidence of mosaic NF2 disease,
although in one patient no NF2 mutation was found in either
tumor and there was no loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

Of the ﬁve patients with familial disease whose samples
were tested, four were found to have a germline SMARCB1
mutation (Table 1). The four pathogenic mutations included
0
two patients with the same mutation within the 3
untrans-
UTR), c.*82C>T, which has been observed
lated region (3
previously by Boyd et al. (7). This mutation was originally
reported to have unknown pathogenicity: however, it has now
been tracked with disease in four separate affected families,
it was retained in tumors in combination with loss of the wild-
type allele, and it was not found in a cohort of 50 unaffected
individuals or in the SNP database, dbSNP (7,20). It has also
subsequently been reported that this mutation affects gene
expression levels and mRNA stability (21). A frameshift
mutation c.38delA in exon 1 was also identiﬁed in a patient
with familial disease. The patient with the c.38delA mutation
developed an MPNST at the age of 52 years. In another of
the familial cohort of patients with no pathogenic mutation,
we again identiﬁed a variant of unknown clinical signiﬁcance
in intron 5, c.628þ13C>T, which is likely to be a nonpatho-
genic rare polymorphism (22).

Of the 25 sporadic disease patients screened, six (24%)
were found to have a germline SMARCB1 mutation. The
mutations included an exon 1 in-frame deletion, c.86_91del
(p. Gly29_Ser30del), which was reported twice in our original
series (8). A single frameshift change, c.1000_1001insG,
was found in one patient in exon 8, which introduces a pre-
mature stop codon. A missense mutation in exon 1, c.40C>T
(p.Pro14Ser), was found in a 38-year-old with two deep-
seated schwannomas. We have circumstantial evidence
from several sources to suggest that it is pathogenic. First,
although we have not observed this mutation previously and
to our knowledge it has not been described in the literature, a
mutation affecting the same nucleotide, c.40C>T (p.Pro14-
His), which segregated with disease, has been seen in two
schwannomatosis-affected families (8). The affected amino
acid is highly conserved evolutionarily in SMARCB1, down to
Caenorhabditis elegans. In silico analysis with three pro-
grams (Align GVGD, SIFT, and PolyPhen) also predicted
that c.40C>T (p.Prol4Ser) has a deleterious effect on normal
protein function. Two further sporadic disease patients
0
UTR mutation c.*82C>T, which as evidenced
harbored the 3
above is thought to be pathogenic. A further 3
UTR variant,
c.*70C>T, was found in one sporadic disease patient. In
silico analysis of this variant predicted it would create a novel
high ranking splice donor site, extremely similar in ranking
0
UTR to the c.*82C>T
and position in the SMARCB1 3
mutation.

MLPA in a ﬁfth. A sixth tumor simply demonstrated LOH.

Germline mutations in AT/RT

A total of 30 AT/RT patients were screened in this study, and
8 of 30 (27%) of these had germline mutations (Table 2).
Seven tumors were available from the 22 individuals without
a germline mutation. Both mutational hits were identiﬁed in
six tumors (four tumors had a point mutation associated with
loss of the wild-type allele, and two tumors had homozygous
whole gene deletions) and a single point mutation was
identiﬁed in the seventh. None of the mutations identiﬁed in
these tumors were present in germline DNA.

Correlations of germline mutations with AT/RT

A total of 48 germline mutations have been identiﬁed in
schwannomatosis (Table 3), including those documented in
the original report (8), and 77 germline AT/RT mutations
have been identiﬁed, including those in the current report and
previous reports of SMARCB1 screening in two large series
(16,23).

Among the reported germline mutations, there were highly
signiﬁcant differences in both position (Table 4) and mutation
type (Table 5). Mutations in schwannomatosis clustered
around either end of the gene more signiﬁcantly than in AT/
RT (P < 0.0001) (Table 4). Mutations in schwannomatosis

were more likely to be in the 3
missense (0 in AT/RT; P < 0.0001), splice site (P Z 0.005),
or in-frame deletion (P Z 0.02). AT/RT mutations were more

likely to be whole gene or multiple exon deletions or dupli-
cations, which accounted for 34 of 77 mutations (44%)
compared with none in schwannomatosis (P < 0.0001)
(Tables 4 and 5). They were also more likely to be nonsense
mutations (P Z 0.005) (Table 5). The only mutation type that
was not clearly different between phenotypes was frameshift
mutation (P Z 0.33).

Discussion

Since the initial identiﬁcation of SMARCB1 mutations as a
cause of schwannomatosis, a number of patient cohorts
have been screened. The proportion of schwannomatosis
patients with identiﬁed germline mutations found through
these screens is shown in Table 3. From our current and
previous reports combined, 13 of 30 patients (43%) with fa-
milial schwannomatosis and 15 of 142 patients (10.5%) with
sporadic disease had an identiﬁable SMARCB1 mutation.
We have reclassiﬁed one of the sporadic cases from our
original report in Table 3 as familial, as the patient’s father
was found to have been affected with schwannomatosis and
have the c.86_91del (p. Gly29_Ser30del) (8). The combined
rates of SMARCB1 mutation in all patient series (without
case report studies) are 26 of 54 (48%) for familial and 21 of
215 (9.5%) for sporadic schwannomatosis. Our combined
report contributes more than 60% of all reported schwan-
nomatosis series. The exon 1 mutation c.41C>A (p. Pro14-
0
UTR mutation c.*82C>T
His) (10% of our series) and the 3
are the most common changes reported in patients with
schwannomatosis to date. These constitute 3 of 28 (11%)

and 8 of 28 (28%) of the mutations identiﬁed in our own
combined series (8,19).

The mutations found in schwannomatosis patients are
predominantly nontruncating mutations, including missense
mutations and a common in-frame deletion in exon 1. The
most common mutation identiﬁed so far is found within the
0
UTR at c.*82C>T. The effect of this alteration is currently
3
unknown, although it does segregate with disease and has
not been reported in unaffected individuals. It is possible that
this mutation may act by regulating gene expression through
alternative splicing within the UTR, although further work is
necessary to determine this. The additional exon 1 and exon
8 mutations in the present report, without any additional
mutations within the central portion of
further
validate the hot spots at either end of the gene in schwan-
nomatosis (Figure 1). This ﬁnding is in contrast to the mu-
tations found in AT/RT tumors, which occur mainly in the
central exons or which delete all, or large parts, of the coding
sequence. The associations reported here are some of the
clearest genotypeephenotype correlations reported, with P
values for many parameters at
less than 0.0001. The

associations between missense mutations and schwanno-
matosis and not AT/RT are equally strong; although trun-
cating mutations do occur predominantly in AT/RT, they still
occur in schwannomatosis, predominantly in exon 1. This
report thus strengthens the hypothesis that AT/RT mutations
are associated with a loss of the SMARCB1 protein product,
whereas schwannomatosis-associated mutations are much
more likely to be hypomorphic, producing the SMARCB1
protein at reduced expression levels or a partial
loss of
function, as suggested in a recent report on expression of
schwannomatosis-associated mutant SMARCB1 transcripts
(21). Nonetheless, an explanation for the truncating muta-
tions that occur frequently in exon 1 in schwannomatosis
patients is required to explain why these mutations do not
appear to cause AT/RT.

There is a much higher rate of germline mutation detec-
tion in familial schwannomatosis patients than in sporadic
disease patients (Table 3). It is possible that the proportion of
sporadic patients with SMARCB1 mutations may be higher
than currently thought but that some SMARCB1 mutations
are not detected by current screening methods. One possible
explanation for this is mosaicism for schwannomatosis, in
which the mutation exists at a level that is too low to be
detected in blood but is present at a higher level
in the
is also possible that some patients
affected tissues.

fulﬁlling the clinical criteria for schwannomatosis may in fact
have mosaic NF2, which cannot be easily distinguished from
schwannomatosis and which cannot be detected through
genetic testing without at
two tumors available for
analysis (9,24,25). Mosaic NF2 represents a particular
problem in diagnosing schwannomatosis accurately in spo-
radic disease cases (26). Another possibility is that additional
causative, or modiﬁer, genes are yet to be discovered, which
may determine the disease type or severity. The LZTR1
gene, located centromerically to both NF2 and SMARCB1 on
chromosome 22, has recently been identiﬁed as a second
causative gene in schwannomatosis (27). Germline muta-
tions were identiﬁed in 80% of a select cohort of schwan-
nomatosis patients who had tested negative for germline
NF2 and SMARCB1 mutations, but whose tumors all
demonstrated loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22.
The overall mutation identiﬁcation rates and genotypee
phenotype correlations have yet to be determined. However,
there still remain a signiﬁcant proportion of schwannomatosis
patients with no known underlying cause, including patients
with loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 with a
breakpoint occurring after both the LZTR1 and SMARCB1
genes (28).

In addition, previous reports have identiﬁed three fam-
ilies with schwannomatosis or AT/RT found in different
family members (16,17). Malignant rhabdoid tumors tend to
develop at a very early age and are normally lethal, whereas
schwannomatosis tends to occur later in life and does not
normally shorten life expectancy (1). It may be that different
types of mutation can predispose patients to these condi-
tions with differing severity, or that the timing of onset of the
disease may be the important factor in determining which
disease is expressed. It is likely, therefore, that hypomor-
phic schwannomatosis mutations may be allowing in-
dividuals to escape the highest risk period for AT/RT. The
individuals with
current
schwannomatosis have nontruncating mutations or 3
UTR
mutations, their risk of AT/RT will likely not be dramatically
increased.

Whereas it is reassuring that AT/RT is relatively uncom-
mon in SMARCB1 mutation-positive schwannomatosis kin-
dreds, a clear association with MPNST has now emerged
(18). In addition to the two cases we previously reported in
a single family (19), a further case reported in the present
this tumor in
series adds to concern about
SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis. All
four cases re-
ported thus far have point mutations, but there does not
appear to be a clear genotype associated with MPNST. The
frameshift insertion c.245_246insAT in exon 3 (18) is not a
typical schwannomatosis mutation, although the missense
mutation we previously reported in exon 7 is more typical (4).
In contrast, MPNST is extremely rare in NF2 disease
and almost never occurs in the absence of radiation treat-
ment (29).

A combination of speciﬁc types of mutations in these and
other genes may be responsible for the ultimate expression
of speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Further work is necessary to
identify additional causative genes and to determine their
mechanism of action.

A further series of SMARCB1 mutations reported in the
current article, along with eight germline mutations in AT/RT,

combined with those mutations reported in the existing
literature, show one of the clearest genotypeephenotype
correlations in human disease.
