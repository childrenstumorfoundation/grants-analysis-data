ABSTRACT
The neurofibromatoses (NF)—including neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and
schwannomatosis—are related tumor-suppressor syndromes characterized by a predisposition to
multiple tumor types and other disease manifestations, which often result in functional disability,
reduced quality of life, pain, and, in some cases, malignancy. With increasing knowledge of the
biology and pathogenesis of NF, clinical trials with targeted agents directed at NF tumors have
become available. Most clinical trials for patients with NF have used designs and endpoints similar
to oncology trials. However, differences in the disease manifestations and natural history of NF
(compared to cancers) require the development of new designs and endpoints to perform meaningful
NF clinical trials. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS)
International Collaboration was established in 2011 at the Children’s Tumor Foundation meeting
to achieve consensus within the NF community about the design of future clinical trials, with a
specific emphasis on endpoints. The REiNS Collaboration includes 7 working groups that focus
on imaging of tumor response; functional, visual, patient-reported, and neurocognitive outcomes;
whole-body MRI; and disease biomarkers. This supplement includes the first series of recommen-
dations by the REiNS Collaboration. The hope is that these recommendations will be used by mem-
bers of the group and by researchers outside of the REiNS International Collaboration to standardize
the measurement of outcomes and thus improve clinical trials for patients with NF. Ultimately, we
plan to engage industry partners and national regulatory agencies in this process to facilitate the
approval of drugs for patients with NF. Neurology® 2013;81 (Suppl 1):S1–S5

The neurofibromatoses (NF)—including neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2),
and schwannomatosis—are a group of related tumor-suppressor syndromes characterized by a
predisposition to multiple nerve sheath tumors. Neurofibromas are the hallmark tumor of NF1,
whereas schwannomas are the hallmark of NF2 and schwannomatosis. Patients with NF are at risk
for a range of other tumors, including optic gliomas, non-optic gliomas, juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, pheochromocytomas, and gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (NF1); ependymomas (NF2); and meningiomas (NF2 and schwannomatosis).1,2
In addition, patients with NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis are at risk for nontumor manifes-
tations affecting multiple organ systems. Learning disability, cognitive dysfunction, and bony
abnormalities are more common in NF1 patients, cataracts and neuropathy in NF2 patients,
and chronic pain in schwannomatosis patients.3 Together, these disease manifestations may result
in functional disability and reduced quality of life for patients.

Standard treatment for most histologically benign NF tumors is limited to surgery. Over the
past 2 decades, researchers have used cell cultures and mouse models to better understand the

biology, pathogenesis, and array of disease
manifestations in NF1, NF2, and schwanno-
matosis. The increased availability of targeted
antitumor agents
led
directly to the design and execution of clinical
trials for plexiform neurofibroma in NF1 pa-
tients.4–6 In 2007, the Department of Defense
Neurofibromatosis Research Program estab-
lished the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials
Consortium with a mandate to accelerate the
development of multicenter clinical trials for
affected patients. Under the leadership of Drs.
Roger Packer and Bruce Korf, the Consortium
was refunded in 2012 and has established a
goal of hosting 6 clinical trials in the next 5
years.

Most early NF trials adopted trial designs
similar to those used in oncology trials. How-
ever, due to differences in the manifestations
of NF and its natural history compared to solid
cancers, standard trial designs and endpoints
used in oncology have limited applicability to
NF trials for histologically benign tumors.
The NF community continues to struggle with
the optimum design of clinical trials for this
group of patients. Currently, there is a wide
range of endpoints used for clinical trials in
NF patients, with no published consensus
among investigators. The Response Evaluation
in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis
(REiNS) International Collaboration was es-
tablished in 2011 at the Children’s Tumor
Foundation meeting to achieve consensus
within the NF community about future clinical
trials and to accelerate the identification of
agents that will benefit individuals with NF.
This supplement summarizes the recommenda-
tions from the REiNS group to date.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REiNS INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION The REiNS Collaboration is
organized around 7 working groups that focus on
the following topics:
imaging of tumor response,
functional outcomes, visual outcomes, patient-re-
ported outcomes, neurocognitive outcomes, whole-
body MRI, and disease biomarkers. Leaders of the 7
working groups were identified based on their exper-
tise at the initial meeting in 2011. The 7 group lead-
ers comprise the leadership team of the overall REiNS
Collaboration. Membership in each working group is
open to any interested party, and representatives from
patient advocacy groups and funding agencies have

been invited to participate in the effort. Each REiNS
group establishes a meeting schedule; the majority of
meetings are held by teleconference. In-person meet-
ings of the entire group are held at least twice per year
to coordinate efforts among the working groups and
to achieve consensus for recommendations. The lead-
ership team held a preliminary meeting with the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss
endpoints for NF trials. At this meeting, the FDA
encouraged the REiNS Collaboration to use validated
functional and patient-reported outcomes for trials
intended for drug approval.

SUMMARY OF PUBLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS FOR
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS Clinical trials for NF patients
published to date are shown in the table. In these 15
studies, there has been a range of designs and primary
and secondary endpoints. The majority of phase II stud-
ies were designed with imaging response as the primary
endpoint. In these studies, change in 1- or 2-dimensional
measurements or volume was used as the primary out-
come measure and a variety of secondary endpoints was
reported. Of note, few of these studies included end-
points evaluating functional outcomes (e.g., hearing or
vision), patient-reported outcomes (e.g., pain), or neuro-
cognitive outcomes. Thus, the majority of these trials
used endpoints adapted from oncology trials to establish
drug activity against NF-related tumors.

WHY
NOT
APPROPRIATE FOR NF TRIALS A diagnosis of
NF1 or NF2 is associated with decreased survival com-
pared with nonaffected controls.7 However, overall sur-
vival for patients with histologically benign tumors is
extended, and use of overall survival as an endpoint for
clinical trials in NF is not appropriate. Many NF tu-
mors are complex and grow substantially more slowly
than solid cancers, which limits the utility of standard
response criteria used in solid tumor trials.8,9 In addi-
tion, there has been increasing concern by the NIH and
the FDA about the use of imaging response (a decrease
in tumor size) as a surrogate marker for clinical
improvement. This concern stems from the finding
that decreases in tumor size may not lead to clinical
improvement for patients. For this reason, there has
been increased support for the use of clinical and func-
tional outcomes and extensive discussion about the
most appropriate endpoints for NF patients since this
group is burdened with significant morbidity.

FUTURE GOALS/PLANS This supplement presents
the initial progress of several of the working groups
and includes the first series of consensus recommenda-
tions for NF clinical trial endpoints by the REiNS Inter-
national Collaboration. The goal of the group’s efforts is
to recommend outcome measures and methodologies

that will be used by REiNS members and by other
researchers to standardize endpoints for NF clinical tri-
als. Ultimately, we plan to engage industry partners and
national regulatory agencies in this process to facilitate
the approval of drugs for patients with NF. We expect
that these recommendations will be modified with time
as more data on NF-specific endpoints become avail-
able. Until that time, these guidelines may help research-
ers design clinical trials for patients with NF and
improve the comparability of results between trials.
