Abstract

RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib block B-RAF-mediated cell proliferation and
achieve meaningful clinical benefit in the vast majority of patients with B-RAFV600E-mutant
melanoma. However, some patients do not respond to this regimen, and nearly all progress to
therapeutic resistance. We employed a pooled RNA interference screen targeting >16,500 genes to
discover loss of function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest-ranking
gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1
loss mediates resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation.
However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an
ERK inhibitor. NF1 mutations were observed in B-RAF-mutant tumor cells that are intrinsically
resistant to RAF inhibition and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance
to vemurafenib, thus demonstrating the clinical potential for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEK-
targeted therapies.

Introduction

Cancer therapy has arguably entered a transformation fueled by the success of targeted
agents such as kinase inhibitors deployed against tumors harboring “druggable” oncogene
mutations. Unfortunately, resistance to these therapies remains a formidable challenge (1).
In some cases of therapeutic resistance, cancer patients fail to respond to treatment at the
outset (termed ‘de novo’ or innate resistance). Alternatively, resistance may emerge after
several weeks or months of clinical response (termed ‘acquired’ resistance).

The identification of B-RAF mutations as key driver events in malignant melanoma spurred
the development of small molecule inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP
kinase) pathway in an effort to block dysregulated signal transduction engendered by the
mutant B-RAF oncoprotein. As a result, B-RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib or
dabrafenib, or MEK inhibitors such as trametinib, elicited striking clinical response rates
when administered as single agents in patients with B-RAFV600E-mutant melanomas (2–4).
The use of B-RAF and MEK inhibitors in combination further extends the magnitude and
duration of clinical benefit (5). However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to these regimens
remains a major clinical problem. Systematic characterization of resistance to these agents is
therefore needed in order to further the development of combined therapeutic strategies that
either complement existing therapies or provide alternative treatment avenues.

Several mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib have been described, most of which
involve reactivation of downstream MEK/ERK signaling. Interestingly, secondary mutations
involving the B-RAF gatekeeper residue (a threonine at codon 529) – common in drug-
resistant CML and EGFR-mutant lung cancers – have not been observed, although
preclinical data may support such a mechanism (6–9). Multiple laboratories have generated
resistant cell line subclones by chronic exposure to RAF inhibitors in vitro, which may
facilitate identification of resistance mechanisms by functional or genomic characterization
of these cells. Such efforts have implicated amplification or mutation of RAS isoforms (10),
enhanced C-RAF expression (11), activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (12) and a splice
variant of B-RAF that constitutively dimerizes in the presence of inhibitor, producing
sustained MEK/ERK signaling (13). Additionally, systematic gain of function screens
identified COT (MAP3K8) as a resistance effector (14). Moreover, secretion of HGF by
stromal cells may activate MET to promote resistance to B-RAF inhibition (15, 16). In the
aggregate, these studies provided a rationale for the combined use of RAF and MEK
inhibitors, and potentially additional therapeutic avenues that may overcome specific
resistance mechanisms.

Genome-scale RNAi interference screens may offer a systematic and unbiased genetic
approach to study tumor biology and therapeutic resistance. In order to elucidate potential
loss-of-function mechanisms of resistance to B-RAF or MEK inhibition, we performed a
pooled, lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in drug-sensitive B-RAF-mutant
melanoma cells exposed to high RAF inhibitor concentrations. Characterization of surviving
cells identified inactivation of NF1 as a novel mechanism of resistance to both B-RAF and
MEK inhibition.

To identify genes capable of suppressing resistance to B-RAF inhibition, we utilized a
library of 90,000 shRNAs targeting approximately 16,600 genes expressed in A375 cells,
which harbor the B-RAFV600E mutation and are sensitive to small-molecule RAF and MEK
inhibitors (17). Following infection with the lentiviral shRNA library, these cells were
cultured in the presence of either DMSO or 3 μM of the RAF inhibitor PLX4720 for 14 and
7 population doublings respectively (Figure 1A and 1B). A drug-resistant population began
to emerge within two weeks following shRNA infection (Figure 1B), whereas cells
expressing a control shRNA targeting red fluorescent protein (shRFP) remained fully
inhibited during this time frame (data not shown). The relative abundance of each shRNA
was determined by PCR amplification and massively parallel sequencing of lentiviral library
DNA (see Methods). The log fold-enrichment for shRNAs in the PLX4720-treated arm
compared to the DMSO-treated arm was assessed. Using RNAi gene enrichment (RIGER)
analysis (18), a ranked gene list was generated based upon the degree of enrichment of
shRNAs targeting a given gene in the PLX4720-treated arm (Figure 1C). Only 31 genes had

2 or more shRNAs ranked in the top 1000 enriched subgroup (a criterion for candidacy as a
“hit” from this screen)(Supplemental table 1). The top-ranking gene was NF1, which
encodes the RAS-GTPase activating protein (RAS-GAP) neurofibromin (19). In particular,
enrichment of 2 shRNAs targeting NF1 was clearly observed across six PLX4720-treated
replicates (Figure 1D). This data raised the possibility that suppression of NF1 activity
might permit proliferation of B-RAF-mutant melanoma cells in the presence of inhibitory
RAF inhibitor concentrations.

To validate this observation, A375 cells were re-infected with two distinct shRNAs targeting
NF1. Reduced expression of NF1 protein was then confirmed by Western blotting (Figure
1E), and cell proliferation was assessed in the presence or absence of 3 μM PLX4720 for 2
weeks. Both NF1 shRNAs permitted robust cell proliferation (as measured by a colony
formation assay in vitro) in the presence of PLX4720 (Figure 1F). These results suggested
that loss of NF1 in A375 cells may reduce cellular dependency on oncogenic B-RAF for
proliferation.

To determine whether suppression of NF1 could provide a generalizable loss-of-function
mechanism of resistance to RAF inhibition, the B-RAF mutant melanoma cell lines
SKMEL28 and UACC62 were treated with PLX4720 alongside A375 cells following
infection with the shNF1 constructs. In each case, sustained cell proliferation in the presence
of the RAF inhibitor was observed following NF1 silencing, compared to cells expressing a
control shRNA (Figure 2A). Indeed, suppression of NF1 conferred a 5- to 31-fold shift in
the GI50 values observed for PLX4720 (e.g. up to 2.2–3.5 μM compared to 0.112 μM in
control A375 cells). By comparison, ectopic expression of oncogenic KRASG12V, a positive
control for resistance to PLX4720 (and which is functionally equivalent to oncogenic forms
of NRAS) (14) produced a GI50 of 26.3 μM. In parallel, cells were treated with 1 μM
PLX4720 for 16 h and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for ERK
phosphorylation (Figure 2B). Loss of NF1 enabled sustained ERK phosphorylation in the
presence of PLX4720 compared to mock-treated or shLuc-treated cells, although to a lesser
extent than the KRASG12V control (Figure 2B). Thus, NF1 silencing was sufficient to confer
resistance to RAF inhibition in multiple B-RAFV600E melanoma cell contexts.

Recent whole-exome sequencing studies of melanoma tumors suggest that mutant NF1
might provide a “driver” genetic event that dysregulates MAP kinase signaling in some
melanoma cells that lack B-RAF and NRAS mutations. B-RAF/NRAS “wild-type”
melanoma cells are typically unresponsive to RAF inhibition (20–22). We therefore sought
to test the ability of NF1 silencing to compensate for mutated B-RAF and modulate
sensitivity to RAF inhibitors in an immortalized melanocyte model system (23). Knockdown
of NF1 in primary human melanocytes expressing oncogenic B-RAF caused a 10-fold shift
in the PLX4720 GI50, permitted robust proliferation in the presence of 3 μM PLX4720, and
allowed sustained ERK phosphorylation in the presence of 0.2 and 1 μM PLX4720
(Supplemental Figure 1A–C). These experiments provided independent evidence that
silencing of NF1 could confer resistance to RAF inhibition in a MAP kinase pathway-
dependent manner.

Given that NF1 is a known negative regulator of RAS activity (24), we queried the
activation state of RAS in A375 cells following NF1 knockdown using a RAS-GTP pull
down assay. As expected, NF1 suppression caused a substantial increase in the level of
active GTP-bound RAS (Figure 3A). Associated with the increased RAS-GTP, we observed
a concomitant increase in C-RAF activation, as measured by phosphorylation of Ser338
(Figure 3B). C-RAF (Ser338) phosphorylation was further enhanced in the presence of
PLX4720, suggesting that the enhanced RAS-GTP produced by NF1 silencing was
competent to potentiate so-called “paradoxical” RAF activation (25–27).

Based on these observations, we next tested the requirement for C-RAF to mediate NF1-
driven resistance to RAF inhibition by performing combined shRNA-mediated knockdown
of both C-RAF and NF1, followed by assessment of MAPK signaling and sensitivity to RAF
inhibition. Silencing of C-RAF alone had little effect on the responsiveness of MAPK
signaling to PLX4720—this was expected given prior observations that C-RAF is inactive in
B-RAFV600E melanoma under steady state conditions (28). However, under conditions of
combined C-RAF/NF1 knockdown, ERK phosphorylation was inhibited more effectively
compared to knockdown of NF1 alone (Figure 3B). Moreover, whereas cyclin D1 levels
were inhibited by PLX4720 in A375 cells (as expected given the known regulation of this
protein by MAP kinase signaling in B-RAFV600E melanoma), but NF1 silencing partially
alleviated this effect (Figure 3B). Effects of PLX4720 on cyclin D1 protein expression were
restored when both NF1 and C-RAF were depleted concomitantly. Quantitative analysis of
the Western blots confirmed these observations (Figure 3C). Cellular sensitivity to PLX4720
followed a similar trend, whereby combinatorial knockdown of C-RAF and NF1 reversed
the resistance to PLX4720 conferred by NF1 loss (Figure 3D).

Having established that loss of NF1 could promote resistance to RAF inhibition, we sought
to determine if NF1 silencing could also affect sensitivity to pharmacologic MEK inhibition.
In particular, we hypothesized that inhibition of MEK, a substrate of both B-RAF and C-
RAF, might have equal potency regardless of NF1 expression (given that MEK is a limiting
MAPK kinase effector downstream of C-RAF). Interestingly, cells exhibiting NF1
knockdown were partially resistant to AZD6244 (Figure 4A). Here, NF1 silencing increased
theGI50 to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 by approximately 7-fold. ERK phosphorylation was
also sustained in the presence of AZD6244 (Figure 4B). Combined inhibition of B-RAF and
MEK by simultaneous treatment with PLX4720 and AZD6244 achieved greater efficacy
than either agent alone; however, NF1 knockdown was still associated with residual
resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro (Figure 4C). Moreover, a clear
correlation was evident between residual ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell
proliferation (Figure 4D). Nonetheless, a robust resistance phenotype remained apparent in
the setting of NF1 knockdown, even under conditions of combined RAF/MEK inhibitor
exposure.

In the presence of activated RAS, PLX4720 can activate C-RAF through loss of feedback
inhibition and induction of RAF-dimerization (25–27). Conceivably then, the RAS
activation engendered by NF1 loss might promote a biochemical state wherein the activated
RAF/MEK complex is less vulnerable to MEK inhibition, particularly under conditions of
concomitant RAF inhibitor exposure. To test this hypothesis, we used the irreversible RAF
inhibitor AZ628. This compound prevents C-RAF activation due to persistent occupation of
the ATP binding site (25). In contrast to the aforementioned drug conditions, only minimal
resistance (2-fold) was observed to AZ628 (Figure 5A). Moreover, ERK phosphorylation
was effectively suppressed (between 80–90%) by this irreversible inhibitor, even in the
setting of NF1 knockdown but only by 65% in the presence of oncogenic KRAS (Figure
5B). Furthermore, combined NF1/C-RAF knockdown resensitized cells to treatment with
the MEK inhibitor (Supplemental Figure 2). These results provided additional support for
the notion that C-RAF signaling is required for the resistance phenotype induced by NF1
loss.

We also tested the effect of pharmacologic ERK inhibition in this setting using the
compound VTX-11e (29). Interestingly, B-RAFV600E melanoma cells harboring NF1
knockdown remained sensitive to ERK inhibition (Figure 5C). Consistent with this
observation, phosphorylation of the ERK substrate FRA1 was inhibited equally in the
presence or absence of NF1 knockdown (Figure 5D). This pattern of activity was confirmed
in colony formation assays, whereby robust resistance was observed to the selective RAF

inhibitors PLX4720, PLX4032, GDC0879 and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244. However, NF1
knockdown produced only modest resistance to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628, and
no resistance to the ERK inhibitor VTX-11e (Supplemental Figure 3A&B).

To understand the potential for endogenous NF1 inactivation to mediate resistance to RAF
inhibition, we leveraged the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (30) to identify cell line
models that contained putative inactivating NF1 mutations in the context of oncogenic B-
RAFV600E mutation. Toward this end, over 500 CCLE lines have previously been profiled
for pharmacologic sensitivity to RAF and MEK inhibition (30). We identified five B-
RAFV600E cell lines (3 melanomas and 2 colorectal tumors) with co-occurring mutations in
NF1 (Supplemental Figure 4). Of these, three contained obvious “damaging” NF1 mutations
(HS695T: NF1Q959*, LOXIMVI: NF1Q1174*and RKO: NF1L626fs,Q2340fs,V2205A) whereas
two contained point mutations (WM88: NF1R1306Q, LS411N: NF1T2805I), deemed unlikely
to affect NF1 function according to the Mutation Assessor algorithm (data not shown)(31).
HS695T and RKO cells also exhibited reduced NF1 mRNA expression. Firstly, we assessed
NF1 protein expression by Western blotting and those cell lines with damaging mutations in
NF1 expressed significantly less protein than the wild-type cells (Figure 6A). The sensitivity
of HS695T, LOXIMVI and RKO cells to MAPK pathway inhibition by PLX4720 was
assessed alongside A375, SKMEL28 and UACC62 B-RAFV600E/NF1WT melanoma cells.
B-RAFV600E cell lines that expressed no or undetectable levels of NF1 protein (LOXIMVI
and RKO) were highly resistant to the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PLX4720,
whereas HS695T cells which express low levels of NF1 protein were still relatively sensitive
(Figure 6B). In accord with this finding, NF1 mutation correlated with resistance to
PLX4720 in these cells (Figure 6C). The mean GI50 was 0.247 μM in NF1-wild-type cells
which increased greater than 50-fold in the NF1-mutant cell lines to 15.8 μM

Given that NF1 knockdown did not confer resistance to pharmacologic ERK inhibition in
A375 cells (as described above), we tested the hypothesis that B-RAFV600E/NF1-mutant
cancer cell lines might remain sensitive to VTX-11e. Notably, the ERK inhibitor showed
activity against NF1-mutant cell lines with a mean GI50 of 0.781 μM compared to 0.219 μM
in B-RAF-mutant cells with wild-type NF1 (Figure 6D). These results suggested that
pharmacologic ERK inhibition might in principle provide a viable therapeutic strategy in B-
RAFV600E cancer cells harboring NF1 loss.

To confirm that NF1 alterations may confer resistance to B-RAF inhibition in human
melanoma, we assessed the status of NF1 using whole exome sequencing of tumors from
patients who had relapsed during vemurafenib treatment. We identified four patients whose
tumors expressed mutant alleles of NF1 (Figure 7A). Of these, one was a nonsense mutation
(patient 46, p.R2450*) that would likely result in reduced protein expression. This mutation
was present in both pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies, and interestingly the patient had
a progression-free survival of only ~10 weeks. This short duration of response raised the
possibility that the concomitant NF1 mutation conferred intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib
(Figure 7B). The other NF1 mutations were silent events (patient 15, c.135T>C, patient 45 c.
4023G>A and patient 50 c3018C>T) that are not predicted to alter NF1 protein expression.
However, given that NF1 is known to be affected by splice-site mutations (32), we assessed
the predicted impact of these mutations on both canonical splice sites and exon splice
enhancer sites (ESEs) using the Human Splicing Finder (33). This analysis revealed that all
three mutations were located within candidate splicing motifs. Conceivably, then, these
mutations may produce aberrant NF1 exon splicing. Like patient 46, patients 15 and 50
exhibited response rates of relatively short duration (10 and 12 weeks, respectively).
Moreover, these mutations were also observed in both the pre-treatment and post-relapse
biopsies, consistent with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib. In contrast, patient 45
experienced a progression-free survival of five months, and the NF1 mutation was only

present in the post-relapse biopsy (Figure 7C), indicative of acquired resistance. Together,
these observations provide preliminary support for the notion that genomic dysregulation of
NF1 may influence both de novo and acquired resistance to RAF inhibition in the clinical
arena.

Discussion

In malignant melanoma, activating B-RAF mutations confer exquisite dependency on RAF/
MEK/ERK signaling, which has been successfully targeted using small molecule RAF and
MEK inhibitors. However, therapeutic resistance inevitably develops following a period of
disease stabilization or regression, and some B-RAFV600E-mutant melanomas exhibit
intrinsic resistance to these agents (2). Understanding the mechanistic basis of drug
resistance is essential to the development of new therapeutic strategies that maximize
clinical benefit. Here, we queried resistance to RAF inhibition using an unbiased, genome-
scale RNA interference screen for modifiers of sensitivity to small molecule RAF inhibition.
Our approach builds upon complementary studies using gain-of-function approaches, such
as systematic open reading frame (ORF) overexpression screens, (14) or the generation of
resistant cell lines by chronic exposure to inhibitors (10, 11, 13, 34).

The identification of NF1 loss as a resistance effector describes one of the first loss-of-
function events capable of mediating resistance to RAF inhibitors identified by systematic
functional approaches. The protein encoded by the NF1 gene, neurofibromin, is a known
tumor suppressor gene and negative regulator of RAS proteins. This function is achieved
through stimulation of the GTPase activity of RAS by neurofibromin, thus converting it
from an active, GTP-bound form to its inactive GDP-bound form. Therefore, loss of NF1
activates RAS and provides an upstream stimulus to activate C-RAF, driving resistance to a
RAF inhibitor by reactivation of the MAPK pathway. This is consistent with other reported
mechanisms whereby RAS is mutated or amplified in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines,
signaling through C-RAF to maintain MAPK signaling (10, 35). These findings are
therefore consistent with several published reports indicating that the majority of resistance
mechanisms reported for RAF inhibitors involve reactivation of the MAPK pathway. This
underscores a fundamental dependency on RAS signaling potentiated by NF1 loss. This
event also confers a C-RAF dependency in the setting of pharmacologic RAF inhibition, as
evidenced by a near-complete reversal of the resistance phenotype by C-RAF knockdown.
This observation raises the possibility that, in the future, saturating pharmacologic inhibition
of both B- and C-RAF (and possibly A-RAF as well) could reduce the capacity for
resistance to develop. Such inhibition might be achieved by an irreversible RAF inhibitor
that both promotes an inactive conformation of RAF. Consistent with this notion is the
observation that NF1 was unable to confer resistance to AZ628, a tool compound with these
characteristics (25). Consequently, we hypothesized that either a single-agent MEK inhibitor
or combined RAF and MEK inhibition might circumvent NF1-mediated resistance. Indeed,
combined exposure displayed more potent activity in vitro than did either agent alone in the
setting of NF1 knockdown. However, the drug combinations tested herein did not fully
restore sensitivity, at least in vitro. Conceivably, this limitation may be overcome by more
potent MEK inhibitors or clinical RAF/MEK regimens that enable more complete
suppression of MEK/ERK signaling. Alternatively, C-RAF may have MEK-independent
roles in tumor cell survival and proliferation (36–39). Therefore, whilst combined RAF/
MEK inhibition certainly improves clinical responses in B-RAF-mutant melanoma (5), the
potential for NF1 loss (and perhaps other mechanisms of upstream RAS-activation) to drive
resistance may remain. On the other hand, melanoma cells harboring NF1 knockdown
remained sensitive to a selective ERK inhibitor, suggesting that ERK may represent a
pivotal integration point for upstream MAP kinase signaling, and may offer therapeutic
potential for circumventing multiple resistance mechanisms.

To ascertain whether NF1 loss might provide an endogenous resistance mechanism, we
analyzed cancer cell lines in which NF1 mutation co-occurred with B-RAFV600E mutation.
Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we identified 5 B-RAFV600E cell lines that had
NF1 mutations, 3 of which were nonsense mutations. Each of these cell lines was insensitive
to PLX4720, consistent with the NF1 shRNA screening and validation results in RAF-
inhibitor-sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with a published
cohort of 121 primary melanoma tumors, metastatic tumors and short-term cultures (20)
previously analyzed by whole exome sequencing, we gained additional insights into the
potential clinical relevance of NF1 mutations. In this cohort, putatively damaging NF1
mutations were observed in 25% (5/21) of samples that lacked highly recurrent mutations in
either B-RAF or NRAS. Genomic studies of an independent melanoma cohort have also
observed this association (21). However, NF1 mutations were also observed in B-RAF- or
NRAS-mutant tumors, including a splice site mutation (NF1G1166) co-occurring with the
activating mutant B-RAFK601E,P731S, a nonsense mutation (NF1R440*) co-occurring with
NRASQ61K, and a GAP-related domain mutation (NF1P1323L) in a B-RAFV600E tumor.
Given that both melanoma and colorectal tumors harbor coexisting B-RAF and NF1
mutations, it therefore seemed likely that clinical scenarios could arise where NF1 loss
serves as a gating resistance effector in the setting of B-RAF/MEK inhibition. Toward this
end, we assessed NF1 alterations by whole exome sequencing in the tumors of melanoma
patients treated with vemurafenib who progressed whilst on treatment. We identified four
patients whose tumors had NF1 alterations that could impact upon protein function or
expression. One event resulted in a nonsense mutation in NF1 (p.R2450*), likely to result in
nonfunctional protein. The other three mutations were silent events but importantly, they
occurred in putative splice regulatory or exon splicing enhancer sites predicted to regulate
proper mRNA processing. These data affirm the potential for NF1 alterations to drive both
de novo and acquired resistance to vemurafenib in melanoma. As deep genomic/molecular
characterization accrues for tumor specimens obtained prior to treatment, during treatment
and following relapse, the relevance of NF1 loss to clinical resistance should become
clearer.

Our data may also endorse the development of irreversible RAF inhibitors. Such agents may
in principle show benefit in NRAS-mutant tumors because of their enhanced dependency
upon C-RAF signaling for tumor cell growth. Alternatively, the use of ERK inhibitors may
overcome numerous melanoma resistance mechanisms if such agents can be administered
safely at doses that achieve robust target inhibition. Toward this end, both irreversible-RAF
and ERK inhibitors are entering preclinical/clinical trials, thereby offering forthcoming
opportunities to evaluate their efficacy in B-RAF-mutant cancers. Altogether, these results
demonstrate the promise of systematic preclinical studies combined with knowledge of
tumor genetic/molecular alterations to elucidate cancer drug resistance mechanisms that may
inform novel therapeutic avenues for many types of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents

Cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) or the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) and cultured in either RMPI1640 or DMEM (Cellgro), 10%
FBS (Gemini Bio-Products) as recommended by the suppliers. Cells were passaged for less
than 6 months after receipt and authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling. PLX4720,
PLX4032, AZ628, GDC0879 and AZD6244 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals and
the ERK inhibitor VTX-11e was synthesized as previously reported (29). Expression
constructs for KRASG12V have been described previously (40). Primary human melanocytes
expressing Myc-tagged B-RAFV600E were cultured in Ham’s F10 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS (23).

Pooled lentiviral shRNA screen

Page 8

A375 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 3×106 cells/well, and a total of
7.2×107 cells/replicate were infected with a 90,000 shRNA pooled library at an MOI of 0.3–
0.5 (18). Cells were centrifuged for 2 h at 2000 rpm, followed by an immediate medium
change. The next day, cells were pooled and transduced cells were selected by culturing in
the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 d. Cells were then seeded into T225 flasks for
each replica and treated with either DMSO or 3 μM PLX4720. DMSO-treated cells were
passaged for up to 14 population doublings and PLX4720-treated cells were passaged for
approximately 7 population doublings. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and stored at
−80 °C in PBS. Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (18) and the shRNA
sequences were amplified by PCR (41). Here, 140 μg of genomic DNA was split over 60
reactions per sample, reactions were then re-pooled per sample prior to a secondary PCR
step. Illumina adapters and independent sample barcodes were incorporated during this
secondary PCR step using a scaled-up secondary PCR reaction consisting of six 100 μl
reactions, followed by massively parallel sequencing (Illumina). The number of reads for
each shRNA was incorporated into the following calculation to normalize between samples:
Log2((shRNA reads/total reads for sample)×1e6). The enrichment of shRNAs in the
PLX4720-treated arm relative to the DMSO arm was determined using the RIGER
algorithm, ‘2nd-best shRNA’ analysis in GENEE (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/
software/GENE-E/)(18) to produce a ranked list of statistically significant genes based on
the degree of corresponding shRNA enrichment in the PLX4720-resistant population. By
ranking genes according to the ranking of the ‘2nd best shRNA’ per gene, results are
influenced less by high-ranking, single shRNA hits for a given gene.

shRNA/ORF constructs and lentiviral infections

All shRNA expression constructs were obtained from The RNAi Consortium and the Broad
Institute RNAi Platform. shRNAs were expressed from the lentiviral expression plasmid
pLKO.1 or pLKO-TRC005, and virus was produced by transfection of approximately
2.4×106 293T cells with 3 μg pLKO.1, 2.7 μg Δ8.9 (gag, pol) and 0.3 μg VSV-G plasmids
using 18 μl Fugene6 (Promega). Viral supernatant was harvested 72 h post-transfection.
Mammalian cells were infected at a 1:100 dilution of virus in the presence of 4 μg/ml
polybrene (Millipore) and centrifuged for 30 min at 2000 rpm. The culture medium was
changed immediately after spin infection and 24 h later, puromycin at a concentration of
0.5–1 μg/ml was added to select for infected cells. pLX304 plasmids for LacZ and
KRASG12V were used to generate lentivirus as above. Cells were infected in the same
manner except 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Life Technologies) was used to select for infected cells.

shRNA constructs used

The shRNA constructs used in this study were:

SHC002 MISSION pLKO.1-puro Non-Mammalian shRNA Control, sequence

centrifugation for 30 min at 2000 rpm followed by an immediate medium change. After 3 d
the medium was again changed and compounds added to the required concentrations. After
a further 4 d, cell proliferation was assessed using the cell-titer glo reagent (Promega). GI50
values were determined using GraphPad Prism. For colony formation assays, shRNA-
infected cells were seeded at 300 cells/well of a 12-well plate and incubated with 3 μM
PLX4720 or DMSO for 2 weeks. Medium containing either DMSO or PLX4720 was
changed every 3–5 d. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet; plates were then washed with distilled water and photographed.

Protein analysis

Cells were seeded at 5–10×104 cells/well in 6 well plates. Following treatment, cells were
then washed with PBS and lysed in 1% SDS lysis buffer. Following protein normalization
using the BCA reagent (Sigma), equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE
(Life Technologies) and transferred to PVDF-Fl membranes (Bio-Rad). Western blots were
blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer and then probed with the desired antibodies overnight
at 4 °C. Bands were detected using IR fluorescence and an Odyssey scanner (Li-Cor
Biosciences). Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Sigma, Millipore, BD Biosciences, Li-Cor Biosciences and Thermo-Fisher Scientific. The
determination of RAS-GTP levels in cell lysates was performed using the RAS Activation
Assay Kit (Millipore).

In-cell Western

Cells were seeded in 96 well clear-bottomed, black micro titer plates at 2×104 cells/well.
The next day, cells were treated with a 10-point titration of PLX4720 for 16 h. Cells were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% TX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The wells
were blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer for 30 min and incubated with antibodies to
phospho-ERK (Sigma) and ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were
washed 3 times with 200 μl 0.1% tween 20 and incubated with Li-Cor secondary antibodies
(anti-mouse IR800, anti-rabbit IR680) for 1 h. The plates were scanned using an Odyssey
scanner (Li-Cor) and quantified using the manufacturer’s software. ERK phosphorylation
was calculated as a percentage of vehicle-treated controls.

Clinical Samples

All melanoma and matched normal samples analyzed were collected and sequenced under
an Institution Review Board approved protocol (COUHES#0806002814). Standard Broad
Institute Sequencing Platform techniques were used for DNA extraction and quality
assessment (20).

Library Preparation, Assembly, and Quality Control

Exome capture and library construction were performed as previously described (42), and
libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 machines. The resulting sequencing data
obtained from the Illumina pipeline were assembled using the Picard pipeline (43). Cross-
contamination of samples was estimated using ContEst (44), and samples with > 5%
contamination were excluded from this study. SNP fingerprints from each lane of a tumor/
normal pair were crosschecked to confirm concordance, and non-matching lanes were
removed from analysis.

Identification of Somatic Mutations

Somatic single nucleotide base-pair substitutions were identified using MuTect (45).
Annotation of identified mutations for mutation effect was done using Oncotator (46). These
algorithms were executed using the Broad Firehose Infrastructure (47).

for 3 d. Cells were then treated with either DMSO or 3 μM PLX4720 for up to 14
population doublings. shRNA sequences were amplified by PCR and the relative abundance
of each shRNA determined by Illumina sequencing.
(B) Growth of A375 cells infected with approximately 90,000 shRNAs and cultured in the
presence of either DMSO or 3 μM PLX4720 for up to 14 population doublings.
(C) The number of reads per shRNA was normalized and log2 transformed and shRNA data
for 2 DMSO controls and 6 PLX4720-treated replicas was analyzed using a ‘2nd best
shRNA’, 2-class comparison of log-fold change (LFC) in RIGER to generate a ranked list of
genes that were enriched in the PLX4720-treated cells. The screening hits are visualized by
plotting the function y=1/normalized enrichment score (NES). The top 5-ranking candidate
genes are indicated.
(D) Heat map of shRNA representation across early time point, DMSO-and PLX4720-
treated replicas for the screen. shRNAs 39714 and 39717 were enriched across all drug-
treated replicates.
(E) Validation of shRNA-mediated knockdown of NF1 in A375 cells. A375 cells were
infected with shRNAs against luciferase or NF1, after selection in puromycin, cell lysates
were made and levels of NF1 protein determined by Western blotting.
(F) A375 cells infected with either shLuc or shNF1 were cultured in the presence or absence
of 3 μM PLX4720 for 2 weeks. Cells were fixed, then stained with crystal violet and
photographed.

Figure 2. Knockdown of NF1 drives resistance to selective B-RAF inhibitors through
reactivation of the MAPK pathway
(A) A375, SKMEL28 and UACC62 cells are resistant to PLX4720 following knockdown of
NF1. shRNA-infected cells were treated with a 10-point concentration response of the
inhibitor for 4 d and cell proliferation determined using cell-titer glo. Cells were also
infected with LacZ and KRASG12V-expressing lentivirus to act as negative and positive
controls respectively.
(B) Loss of NF1 is permissive for MAPK-signaling in the presence of B-RAF inhibitors.
shRNA-infected A375, SKMEL28 and UACC62 cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of the inhibitors for 16 h, cell lysates were made and analyzed by Western
blotting for the indicated proteins. Cells were also infected with LacZ and KRASG12V-
expressing lentivirus to act as negative and positive controls respectively.

Figure 4. Both MEK inhibition and combined RAF/MEK inhibition does not completely reverse
NF1-mediated resistance
(A) A375 cells infected with shRNAs targeting NF1 were treated with a 10-point
concentration response of AZD6244 for 4 d and cell proliferation determined using cell-titer
glo. Cells were also infected with LacZ and KRASG12V-expressing lentivirus to act as
negative and positive controls respectively.
(B) In parallel to the above, cells were treated with 0.2 μM AZD6244 for 16 h and cell
lysates analyzed by Western blotting for the indicated proteins.
(C) Combinatorial inhibition of B-RAF and MEK using PLX4720 and AZD6244 does not
fully overcome NF1-mediated resistance. A375 cells were infected with the stated shRNAs/
ORFs and then exposed to a 10-point concentration response of PLX4720 alone or PLX4720
plus 0.2 μM AZD6244 for 4 d. Cell proliferation was determined by cell-titer glo.
(D) Combined B-RAF/MEK inhibition does not fully block NF1-mediated resistance at the
level of ERK phosphorylation. A375 cells were infected with shRNAs/ORFs as above and
then treated with either DMSO (D), 1 μM PLX4720 (P), 0.2 μM AZD6244 (A) or a
combination of PLX4720 and AZD6244 (C) for 16 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western
blotting for the indicated proteins.

Figure 6. Loss of NF1 is observed in some B-RAF-mutant human melanoma and colorectal cell
lines
(A) Melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines from the Broad Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia were assessed for expression of B-RAFV600E and damaging mutations in NF1.
3 such lines were identified (HS695T, LOXIMVI and RKO, colored red) and analyzed
alongside a panel of B-RAFV600E/NF1WT cells (colored blue) for expression of NF1 protein
by quantitative Western blotting. A two-tailed t-test was performed to determine if the
expression of NF1 protein was significantly different between cells expressing either wild-
type or mutant protein. Incomplete suppression of ERK phosphorylation by PLX4720 in
NF1-mutant cell lines. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PLX4720 for
16 h, cells were analyzed for ERK2 and phospho-ERK1/2 by In-cell Western. Cells with
wild-type NF1 are labeled blue, those with mutant NF1 are labeled red.
(B) Reduced expression of NF1 protein is associated with resistance to PLX4720. NF1-wild-
type and mutant cell lines were treated with a 10-point titration of PLX4720 for 16 h and
ERK phosphorylation was assessed using an in-cell Western assay. Cells with wild-type
NF1 are labeled blue, those with mutant NF1 are labeled red.
(C) Reduced expression of NF1 protein is associated with resistance to PLX4720. NF1-
wild-type and mutant cell lines were treated with a 10-point titration of PLX4720 for 4 d and
cell proliferation was assessed using cell-titer glo. Cells with wild-type NF1 are labeled
blue, those with mutant NF1 are labeled red.

Figure 7. Whole-exome sequencing identifies NF1 mutations in melanoma patient tumors
exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib
(A) Melanoma patients who progressed on treatment with vemurafenib were biopsied pre-
and post-treatment. Whole-exome sequencing was performed and NF1 alterations assessed.
The NF1 mutations are listed alongside the functional impact on the expressed protein.
Silent mutations were assessed for their potential effects on splicing sites using the human
splicing finder. The splicing motif affected by the mutation (in red) is indicated and ‘site
broken’ indicates potentially damaging effects on splice site function.
(B) Progression free survival data was extrapolated from Chapman et al (2) and the number
of patients who progressed per month is in blue, the cumulative number of progressing
patients is in gray. NF1 mutations observed in our cohort of patients are overlaid at their
respective PFS times. Patients with a PFS of less than three months were nominated for de
novo resistance, while those with a PFS of greater than or equal to three months
demonstrated acquired resistance. Three NF1 alterations are observed in pre-treatment B-
RAF-mutant melanoma patient samples, and all three patients demonstrated de novo
resistance. A fourth patient with a PFS of five months exhibited acquired resistance.
(C) Integrative Genomics Viewer (48) plot showing an NF1 silent mutation observed in the
post-relapse biopsy sample only (c.4023G>A) in a patient with a PFS of five months.
