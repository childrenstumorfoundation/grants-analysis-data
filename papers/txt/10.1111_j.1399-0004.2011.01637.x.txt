Whole genome proﬁling such as array comparative genomic hybridization
has identiﬁed novel genomic imbalances. Many of these genomic
imbalances have since been shown to associate with developmental delay,
intellectual disability and congenital malformation. Here we identiﬁed ﬁve
unrelated individuals who have a recurrent 1.71 Mb deletion/duplication at
2q13 (Human Genome Build 19: 111,392,197-113,102,594). Four of these
individuals have developmental issues, four have cranial dysmorphism.
Literature review revealed 14 more cases that had similar genomic
imbalances at 2q13. Many of them had developmental delay and
dysmorphism. Taken together, 93% and 63% of individuals with this
genomic imbalance displayed impaired developmental skills and/or
abnormal facial features respectively. This copy number variant (CNV)
has not been reported in normal control databases. We, therefore, propose
that CNV in this region is a risk factor for developmental delay and
dysmorphism.

Whole genome microarray scanning uncovered the
widespread existence of copy number variant
(CNV), deﬁned as a greater than 1 kb segment of
DNA that has variable copy number as compared to
reference genome in normal humans (1–3). A large
number of novel CNVs have also been discov-
ered among individuals with clinical phenotypes
and many of them are known to be associated with
diseases (reviewed in Refs (4–6)). Those CNVs
that have not been reported in the normal control

databases, do not overlap with genomic regions
that are known to be associated with disorders and
do not involve genes with known dosage effect, are
temporally classiﬁed as CNV of unknown signiﬁ-
cance (7). Currently, a signiﬁcant portion of CNVs
detected in patients belongs to this category. It is
important yet challenging to establish association
between a novel CNV and a clinical phenotype.
Such study depends largely on case accumulation
which requires a long-term effort.

Yu et al.

Here, we present ﬁve unrelated children who
had a 1.71 Mb deletion/duplication at chromosome
2q13, a CNV of unknown clinical signiﬁcance.
Four such individuals exhibited developmental dis-
ability (DD), of which, three carried the diagnosis
of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Further, four
of the children had dysmorphic facial features.
Although genomic imbalance in this region had
been observed previously, its association with DD
and facial abnormality was not established (8, 9).
Based on the different occurrences of this genomic
imbalance in patient and normal populations, we
propose that the recurrent genomic imbalance at
2q13 is a novel genetic risk factor for DD.

Materials and methods

Study subjects
Individuals in this study were identiﬁed among
5523 consecutive samples with clinical
indica-
tions of developmental delay, mental retardation
and multiple congenital anomalies tested by clin-
ical chromosomal microarray analysis between
November 2006 and December 2009. Medical
chart review was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Children’s Hospital Boston.

Chromosomal microarray analysis
aCGH was performed using Agilent 244K
oligonucleotide CGH array microarray (G4411B)
following the manufacturer’s instructions [oligonu-
cleotide array-based CGH for genomic DNA
analysis protocol version 3 (Agilent Technolo-
gies, Palo Alto, CA)] and previously described
method (10).

Results

Case 1
This individual was born at 39 weeks gestation by
a cesarean section because of breech presentation.
aCGH was performed at the age of 4 months for
concerns of multiple dysmorphic facial features
including hypertelorism, a broad and depressed
face, and a prominent forehead, as well as multiple
congenital anomalies including several ventricular
septal defects, anteriorly placed anus and bilat-
eral partial duplication of collecting system and
bilateral biﬁd ureters. At age 2, no obvious devel-
opmental issue was noticed.

Case 2
This individual was born at 37 weeks gesta-
tion by cesarean section for breech presentation.

258

Morphological features, including excess nuchal
skin folds, wide-spaced nipples and a microphal-
lus, were noticed at birth. At 7 h of life, he devel-
oped seizure and hypoglycemia.

infundibular

aCGH was performed at age of 4 years for
concerns of autism, staring episodes, abnormal
electroencephalogram, panhypopituitarism asso-
ciated with a ectopic posterior pituitary and
absent
status post-
bilateral orchidopexy for undescended testicles,
status post-tympanostomy tube insertion and sta-
tus post-adenotonsillectomy. He has history of
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
obesity and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

stalk. He is

Case 3
This individual was born at 34 weeks gestation by
cesarean section because of premature labor. She
was enrolled in an Early Intervention Program with
speech and language therapy, occupational therapy
and physical therapy since the age of 3 years.

aCGH was performed at age 5.5 years for con-
cerns of pervasive developmental disorder not oth-
erwise speciﬁed (PDD-NOS) and macrocephaly.
She also presented with symptoms of ADHD. She
walked at 2 years of age and began talking at
around the same time. At 6 years old, she ran but
lacked coordination, and had trouble jumping on
one foot.

Case 4
This individual is the product of an in vitro fer-
tilization. He was delivered by normal vaginal
delivery at 38 weeks gestation. He had transient
tachypnea of newborn which was followed by
pneumonia.

aCGH was performed at 15 months of age for
concerns of developmental delays. He has macro-
cephaly and partial midline clefting of the upper
lip. Scoliosis was noted at
the thoracolumbar
region. The penis appeared small. He has hypoto-
nia throughout. Brain magnetic resonance imaging
revealed slight molar tooth malformation appear-
ance of the midbrain, a small vermis with abnor-
mal cerebellar folia, and a midline vermian cleft
with thickening of the superior cerebellar pedun-
cles, suggestive of Joubert syndrome. Diagnos-
tic sequencing of NPHP1 and AHI1 genes was
normal.

Case 5
This individual was induced because he was late
for dates and ultimately delivered by forceps
assistance. His early developmental milestones

were reached late in both language and motor
spheres. He had hypospadias and plagiocephaly.

aCGH was performed at 6 years for concerns
on PDD-NOS with mild hypotonia and diminished
strength. He also had substantial difﬁculties in ﬁne
motor planning (e.g. handwriting).

Individuals 1–4 shared a similar deletion at
2q13 (Fig. 1).
Individual 5 had a reciprocal
duplication. The region is ﬂanked by segmen-
tal duplications of about 76 kb in size and with
>99% matched bases (110,552,944-110,586,660
and 113,112,671-113,188,294), which presumably
mediated the rearrangement
through non-allelic
homologous recombination mechanism. The clin-
ical features of the ﬁve children are summarized
in Table 1. Individuals 2, 3 and 5 were diagnosed
with ASD. Individuals 1 and 4 did not meet the
age criteria for autism assessment, but individual
4 had some language and motor delays. Three of
the four individuals with 2q13 deletion appeared
to have large stature and overweight/obesity.

In addition to DD, hypotonia and cranial dys-
morphic features were noted among them. All
except individual 1 had hypotonia. Individual 1
had hypertelorism and macrocephaly,
individu-
als 3 and 4 also had macrocephaly and individ-
ual 5 had deformational plagiocephaly. Some of
these appeared to bear resemblance to their par-
ents – individual 1’s father also had hypertelorism
and both parents of
individual 4 had macro-
cephaly.

Parental aCGH were performed in three cases.
All of which (individuals 1, 3 and 4) indicated
familial inheritance. Family histories of DD were
noted for
individuals 3 and 4 – both parents
of individual 3 required special education and
numerous DD/neurological issues were noted in
the family of individual 4.

Discussion
We observed four individuals with a recurrent
1.71 Mb microdeletion at 2q13 from about 5523
cases for clinical diagnostic aCGH testing. Two
had ASD. The other two did not meet the age
criteria for autism assessment, but one had devel-
opmental delays. This microdeletion has not been
reported in over 7000 normal individuals recorded
in the Database of Genomic Variants (accessed in
August 2010) including 2026 healthy children in
CHOP CNV database (cnv.chop.edu). The 2q13
deletion is signiﬁcantly enriched in patient popula-
tion (p = 0.04, χ2 test with Yates’ correction). We
therefore propose that this microdeletion is proba-
bly clinically relevant.

Ten deletion cases had been reported in the lit-
erature (8, 9, 11) and the DECIPHER database
(Table 2). Although features of developmental
delay and dysmorphism are often documented (8,
9, 11), an analysis of its CNV–phenotype associa-
tion has not been made and this CNV has not been
categorized as pathogenic.

Bisgaard et al. (11) reported two brothers who
inherited the 2q13 deletion from their mother (#14,
Table 2). Both had signiﬁcant psychomotor delay
and similar mild dysmorphic features. Because
the carrier mother was phenotypically normal, the
authors concluded that
the 2q13 deletion is a
normal variant.

Rudd et al. (9) reported the detection of three
2q13 deletions among 2419 samples from patients
referred for aCGH testing (#11–13, Table 2). One
had severely impaired speech and language skills,
and mild facial features; another had intra-uterus
growth retardation, and signiﬁcant dysmorphic
facial features including microcephaly, microg-
nathia, low-set ear, neck webbing and multiple
malformations involving congenital heart defect,

Yu et al.

esophageal atresia and inguinal hernia. A third
exhibited severe congenital heart defect, as well
as seizure and sleep apnea. The authors concluded
that the clinical signiﬁcance of this genomic imbal-
ance was emerging with uncertain signiﬁcance.

Five cases of 2q13 deletion were described in the
DECIPHER database (#6–10, Table 2). No clini-
cal information was provided for three of them
except that they were affected, the other two had
developmental delay. One of the individuals had a
de novo 2q13 deletion, one had inherited deletion,
and the rest had no inheritance information. The
de novo nature of 2q13 deletion added further evi-
dence supporting the causal role of this deletion in
the patient’s condition. The fact that the parents of
several individuals (#3 and 4, Table 1) were also
affected suggested the potential cosegregation of
CNV with phenotypes in these families. However,
phenotypic discordance among those with inher-
ited genomic imbalances did not necessarily rule
out the contributory role of the genomic imbalance
to the phenotype.

The

reciprocal duplication has

also been
reported (Table 3). The one in the DECIPHER
database (#16, Table 3) did not have detailed
clinical
information. The other three (#17–19)
had developmental delays. In our facilities, we
observed one (#5, Table 1) who was diagnosed
with ASD. Of all these ﬁve patients, four had
dysmorphic features (Tables 1 and 3). But unlike
deletion, the duplication has been detected in 1/876
normal controls (9). This suggests that the dupli-
cation had less penetrance.

Of a total of 19 cases with 2q13 imbalances,
documentations of developmental features were
available on 14. Out of these 14 cases, 93%
(13 of 14) had various degree of developmen-
tal delay and ﬁve had conﬁrmed ASD diagnosis.
It is unclear whether ASD was assessed in the
other individuals. Therefore, while our analysis
suggests that 2q13 imbalance increases the risk of
developmental delay, the exact correlation between
ASD and 2q13 deletion/duplication remains to be
determined.

In addition to developmental issues, we noted
various cranial facial dysmorphism in four of
the children we described and eight individuals
from the literature (9) and DECIPHER database
(Tables 2 and 3). Taken together, at least 12 of
19 (63%) (cases without dysmorphism informa-
tion were also included in the total case) individ-
uals who had genomic imbalance at 2q13 exhib-
ited some cranial facial dysmorphism. Although
some features such as macrocephaly/microcephaly
appeared more frequently, no consistent pattern
was noticed.

262

While both deletions and duplications are
associated with developmental delay and non-
speciﬁc dysmorphism, contrasting phenotypes may
exist between patients with the microdeletion
and the reciprocal duplication. For example,
large body habitual (tall stature, overweight and
macrocephaly) were more frequently observed
in microdeletion patients; microcephaly and thin
body build were more commonly seen in microdu-
plication patients. Such contrasting phenotypes
require more cases for validation.

Some individuals carry additional genomic
imbalances which could modify the phenotype
and/or affect overall penetrance.
Individual 1
inherited a 709 kb gain at 2p22 from her mother.
Her mother also had the 2q13 loss. Individual
3 inherited the 1.71 Mb loss at 2q13 from her
mother, and the 2.62 Mb gain at 22q11.21 from
her father. The 22q11.21 gain is known to impair
development (12). Both her parents required spe-
cial educations, which could potentially be caused
by the genomic imbalances at 2q13 and 22q11.21.
The developmental issues experienced by individ-
ual 3 could be the additive effect of genomic
imbalances at 2q13 and 22q11.21. Individual 6
inherited a 1.19 Mb gain at 1q44 from a men-
tally healthy father, and a 1.62 Mb loss at 2q13
from a mentally healthy mother. The combination
of two CNVs may exacerbate mental impairment,
representing a two-hit model (13). Individual 8
had a 4.56 Mb gain at 1p36 of possible clinical
signiﬁcance.

(Fig. 1). Of all

In the 19 individuals described here,

the
smallest overlapping genomic imbalance at 2q13
was mapped to the 1.13 Mb at 111,616,529-
112,746,937(hg19)
the genes
encoded in this region, BCL2L11 and ACOXL
had been linked to neurodevelopment and dys-
morphism (14–19). BCL2L11 encodes an anti-
apoptotic protein, Bcl2-like protein which might
have a role in neuronal apoptosis. Autistic indi-
viduals have been shown to have decreased
Bcl2 expression, suggesting increased apoptosis
might increase the risk of autism (14–16). ACOXL
encodes acyl-coenzyme A oxidase-like 2, a protein
that is responsible for fatty acid oxidation. Alter-
ation of ACOXL gene expression can affect fatty
acid metabolism, which has been suggested to play
a role in neurodevelopment (17–19).

In summary, we presented ﬁve new cases of
1.71 Mb genomic imbalances at 2q13 and revealed
14 similar genomic imbalances at 2q13 from lit-
erature and database. Our analysis shows that the
1.71 Mb CNV at 2q13 poses increased risk for
DD and cranial facial dysmorphism. This ﬁnding
added the 2q13 imbalance to a growing number

recognized as genetic risk factors for DD (20,
21). Identiﬁcation of the genetic basis for DD
will help better understand the pathophysiology of
the condition and allow for better counseling and
management.
