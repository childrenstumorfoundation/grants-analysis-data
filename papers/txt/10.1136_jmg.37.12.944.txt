Use of MRI and audiological tests in
presymptomatic diagnosis of type 2
neuroﬁbromatosis (NF2)

EDITOR—We have previously reported on a large clinical
study of patients with neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2)1 and
described the usefulness of audiological screening in early
detection of VS in NF2.2 Although DNA diagnosis is pos-
sible by linkage analysis and by detecting the NF2 family
speciﬁc mutation, this is not possible in all cases. Only 40%
of sporadic patients (new mutations) have an identiﬁable
NF2 mutation3 and as 50% of NF2 patients have no fam-
ily history,4 up to 30% of those at risk of NF2 will not be
able to have a DNA presymptomatic test. While it is possi-
ble to calculate residual risks of NF2 from age at onset of
symptoms curves,5 a more useful measure would be the
level of risk reduction from a normal cranial MRI scan. A
database recording information on aVected subjects with
NF2 was set up in Manchester in 1989. Patients were
actively sought across the UK from paediatricians, neuro-
surgeons, ENT surgeons, geneticists, and dermatologists.
We have used this database to determine the age at which
MRI detects asymptomatic tumours in subjects with NF2
and the value of audiological screening. We have also cre-
ated life curves for risk reduction in subjects at 50% risk of
NF2.

Patient details from hospital notes and proformas have
been entered into a database at St Mary’s Hospital Man-
chester since 1989. A total of 344 patients fulﬁlling our
published criteria for NF2 are recorded (table 1).1 3 5
Information on all known tumours, age at presentation
and diagnosis, and many diVerent symptoms are included.
We have analysed details of patients who have been
detected as having VS on a screening MRI scan without
any known central nervous system pathology, signs, or
symptoms. It has been our practice to carry out a baseline
MRI scan between 12 and 16 years of age, although some
centres have screened earlier. A review was also made of
subjects diagnosed on the basis of presymptomatic DNA
tests. A separate analysis was undertaken on those cases
who had sequential audiological screening with pure tone
audiogram and ABR before MRI scanning. Standard MRI
screening usually involved T1 and T2 weighted images
before, and T1 weighted images after gadolinium
enhancement with 3 mm cuts through the internal
auditory meati.

A cumulative age at onset curve was derived from the age
at presymptomatic diagnosis on MRI scan (ﬁg 1) and for
residual risk of NF2 (ﬁg 2). An adjustment was made for
large tumours detected on initial prevalence scan. This

allowed for an annual growth rate of 2 mm (derived from
our unpublished data and those of M Baser/V Mautner)
with a minimum detection size of 2-3 mm. Thus, a 20 mm
tumour could have been detected up to an average of eight
or nine years earlier. Age of onset curves were also derived
from oVspring in NF2 families to determine the proportion
who had developed symptoms by each ﬁve year age group.
Residual risks of NF2 were based on Bayesian calcula-
tions,3 so when 67% of subjects would be expected to be
symptomatic or detected on MRI the residual risk of NF2
would be 25%.

MRI screening is useful for reducing the residual risk of
inheriting NF2. ABR
someone at initial 50% risk of
screening still has a place in early detection of vestibular
schwannoma, although MRI screening is the method of
choice.

Forty three ﬁrst degree relatives of NF2 patients have
been diagnosed with NF2 presymptomatically. Twenty one
patients were diagnosed initially with a presymptomatic
DNA test using linkage or mutation analysis. Fourteen of
these have subsequently been found to have VS on MRI
scan. The remaining seven children have not had an initial
MRI scan. Twenty one further patients were diagnosed on
the basis of an MRI scan before having symptoms. These
scans were carried out on initial assessment when the
patient was ﬁrst known to be at risk. Thus, some scans were
only performed when the patients were in their twenties to
forties and the tumour size at initial diagnosis therefore
varied from 1-20 mm in diameter. Mean age at initial posi-
tive scan was 20.5 years (range 8-45 years, median 18

years). All but two patients were the oVspring of a known
NF2 patient. One father of a severely aVected NF2 patient
who claimed not to have symptoms had bilateral 15 and 10
mm VS on initial MRI scan aged 45 years. A further 53
year old male with an aVected brother has had a normal
MRI scan, but his son aged 19 years had a unilateral VS on
scan aged 19 years. The family have a deletion in the NF2
gene removing one exonic cosmid (J Dumanski, personal
communication). Only three patients had an initial normal
MRI scan. The 45 year old father noted above was
excluded from analysis as he may represent a mosaic and
was not at a priori 50% risk. Of the 34 patients detected
presymptomatically, DNA presymptomatic testing would
be possible in 24 owing to the presence of a known muta-
tion or a pedigree structure suitable for linkage analysis at
time of diagnosis. However, in 10 cases (30%) no testing
would have been possible if the patient presented at the
time of writing. Age of onset of symptoms in 110 oVspring
of NF2 patients is presented in ﬁg 3, while the residual risk
for NF2 in someone asymptomatic at 50% initial risk is
presented in ﬁg 4.

Fourteen patients had records of both pure tone audio-
grams and ABR testing within three months of the initial
positive MRI scan (11 from Manchester). Twelve pure
tone audiograms were within normal
limits with no
threshold above 20 dB. Two audiograms showed a unilat-
eral high frequency hearing loss. Five patients with
bilateral intracanalicular VS (1-8 mm diameter) and a
further patient with a l mm unilateral VS showed no
abnormality on audiogram or ABR testing. ABR tests car-
ried out one year later on four bilateral cases showed
delayed latencies on both sides in 3/4 while intracanalicu-
lar diameter remained <9 mm. In three further patients
with bilateral VS on scan, the smaller tumour did not
cause an abnormality to the ABR, although intracanalicu-
lar diameter did not exceed 5 mm. In one of these

945

tumours, six years after initial scan the tumour still
showed no delay in latencies or wave morphology although
the tumour was impinging on the CP angle. In all the
remaining ﬁve patients there was abnormal wave morphol-
ogy or delay of latencies bilaterally consistent with MRI
ﬁndings. Of the 27 tumours from 14 patients, 19 have
shown abnormal ABR (six one year after MRI detection of
VS) with a range of 2 mm intracanalicular diameter to 15
mm intracranial diameter. Median diameter at initial ABR
abnormality was 6 mm, with only one VS extending into
the cerebellopontine angle not being detected.

The UK NF2 database is to our knowledge the largest
clinical database of NF2 in the world. While ascertainment
for the whole UK is not complete, the living diagnostic
prevalence of 1 in 270 000 comes close to the 1 in 200 000
we previously calculated from our own population in the
north west.4 Therefore, this patient series approximates to
a population based series of patients presenting with NF2.
We have detected VS on MRI scans in 35 patients without
NF2 symptoms or signs. The age curves derived from this
group of patients (ﬁgs 1 and 2) will be useful in counselling
subjects at 50% risk of the disease, particularly if no DNA
test is available in their family. As mutation detection can
take up to six months, some degree of risk reduction will
already be possible before a test becomes available in a
family. These curves will, if anything, underestimate the
degree of risk reduction. This is because scans are not
undertaken until 10 years of age and, as can be seen from
ﬁg 3, 10% of NF2 oVspring present symptomatically
before 10 years of age. Our corrected curves assume an
arbitrary rate of growth of 2 mm per year. Many of the
families in which presymptomatic diagnosis was made are
at the extreme mild end of the scale with missense or splice
site mutations and large deletions.6–9 All the patients in
table 2 in which a mutation had been found had these types
of mutation. Nonetheless, faced with a patient without
obvious features of NF2 in which the family history of NF2
is mild, the curves are very useful. Most patients with
severe NF2 do not have children3 and therefore most
oVspring are at risk of the milder forms of the disease.
Indeed, many children of sporadic patients with NF2 may
be at less than 50% initial risk owing to gonosomal mosai-
cism in their parent.3

The value of early detection of VS is still open to some
debate. However, the only realistic chance of hearing pres-
ervation surgery is when the tumour is small10 11 and
tumours may not present symptomatically until 20 mm in
diameter. ABR testing, while not detecting some of the very
small
intracanalicular tumours, still detected the great
majority of tumours at a size when hearing preservation
surgery would not have been compromised. However, the
larger size at detection would leave less leeway for observa-
tion of the growth rate of the tumour. Where MRI scans are
less accessible, ABR testing has more of a role than CT
scanning (see case 11) and could serve as a back up to MRI
in the interval years after normal scans.

It is clear that NF2 patients fare better if they are man-
aged in specialist centres where surgery and occasionally
other measures such as radiosurgery can be oVered at the
appropriate time.12 In experienced hands, hearing can be
preserved with removal of VS and rehabilitation is now
possible with auditory brain stem implants and on occasion
with cochlear implants.10 11

There is still clearly a place for MRI and audiological
screening in at risk relatives as 30% of the patients in this
study would not have been able to have predictive DNA
tests. While the proportion of families with mutations can
be boosted by a comprehensive deletion ﬁnding strategy,13
these are not widely available for NF2 or many other
diseases

history is likely to represent a new mutation of the NF2
gene. If there is no suggestive family history, the risk to
parent and sibs is still low (probably <1%). The cases pre-
sented here of two parents being aVected after a child is to
our knowledge the ﬁrst such report. There is also no objec-
tive evidence that VS disease is worse in females than

Children of aVected patients should be considered to be at
50% risk of NF2 and screening for NF2 can start at birth.5
Cataracts can aVect vision in early life and other tumour
implications are present in the ﬁrst 10 years of life. Formal
screening for VS should start at 10 years, as it is rare for
tumours to occur before that
tests
including ABR are still a useful adjunct to MRI and can
occur annually from 10 years of age. As surgery would only
be contemplated for tumours at about 6 mm and tumour
growth averages 2 mm per year, three yearly screening with
MRI in a subject with no tumours is probably sufﬁcient. The
initial MRI scan could be at around 12 years of age. Once
tumours are present screening should probably be annual.
Spinal tumours are found very frequently on MRI, as many
as 90% having evidence of these in some studies.15 However,
only 25-30% require a spinal operation for a symptomatic
tumour.1 Nonetheless, a full annual neurological examina-
tion is probably a wise precaution. In most families it is now
possible to develop a genetic test so screening can be
targeted on aVected subjects only. Uptake of such testing in
childhood and adult life is high.16 Using the data from this
paper even without DNA tests the residual chance of having
NF2 in a subject at 50% risk can be reduced to around 30%,
10%, and 5% if MRI is negative at 15, 25, and 35 years
respectively.

Suggestive evidence for a site speciﬁc
prostate cancer gene on chromosome
1p36

EDITOR—A report was recently published on the localisation
of a chromosome segment at 1p36 which appeared to be
linked (two point lod score=4.74) to a large number of
families with multiple cases of early onset (mean age at diag-
nosis of <66 years) prostate cancer (PC) in which a brain
tumour had been reported in a ﬁrst or second degree relative
of a PC case.1 This result is consistent with epidemiological
evidence suggesting a familial relationship between brain
cancer and PC as well as numerous studies of LOH at 1p36
in brain tumours.1 As part of
the ACTANE (Anglo/
Canadian/Texan/Australian/Norwegian/EU Biomed) famil-
ial PC Consortium, we have genotyped 207 multiple case
PC families for ﬁve 1p36 tetranucleotide repeat polymor-
phisms, which were used by Gibbs et al,1 and performed
linkage analysis using GENEHUNTER2 with the following
genetic map3: D1S1160 - 3.835 cM - D1S1597 - 4.339 cM
- D1S407-2.611 cM - GATA29A05 (=D1S3669) - 6.520
cM - D1S552. In addition to our interest in assessing our
families for evidence of linkage of prostate and primary brain
cancer to this region, we also wanted to determine if any
other cancer site(s) might be associated with a susceptibility
locus in this region. To this end, the family histories of all
cancers were abstracted from the databases of several Con-
sortium members and included in the analysis.

Table 1 presents the characteristics of the families;
details on how they were ascertained are included in the
footnotes. The criteria used for the prostate cancer familial
clusters in this study are more relaxed than those suggested
by the Hopkins group (referred to as the “Hopkins
criteria” in the ﬁeld).4 The linkage analysis results of nine
prostate-brain cancer families were partitioned according
to mean age at diagnosis of PC in the family; these results
are shown in table 2. (Only two of these brain cancers have
been conﬁrmed by pathology reports; a glioma diagnosed
at 67 years in a man who had three brothers with PC, mean
age of diagnosis 66.7 years, and a glioblastoma diagnosed
at 69 years in a family with ﬁve cases of PC, mean age at
diagnosis of 68.2 years). In the total set of nine families, all
lod, NPL, and hlod scores maximised at D1S1160.
Overall, we found no evidence of linkage of prostate-brain
cancer to this region by either parametric (maximum lod
score=−0.06) or non-parametric (NPL=0.25, p=0.39)
analysis. The maximum hlod was 0.07 at an alpha
(proportion of families linked) of 48%. This latter estimate
is consistent with the observation that four families had
positive lod scores and four had negative scores (one fam-
ily was uninformative, lod=0.0). Partitioning the families
by mean age at diagnosis of PC resulted in suggestive, but
not signiﬁcant diVerential
linkage with ﬁve early onset
families (mean age at diagnosis <66 years) providing a
maximum lod score of 0.48, whereas the remainder of the
families appeared unlinked according to both lod score
(−0.54) and NPL score (−0.20). These results are consist-
ent with the lod scores of Gibbs et al1 for families with a
history of brain tumours when partitioned for average age

lies and sorted them according to these linkage results as
well as by their mean age at PC diagnosis. In no case did a
family history of any cancer at another site appear to clus-
ter or be associated with linkage to 1p36 or with mean age
at PC diagnosis. This analysis included examination by
number and mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer in ﬁrst
degree relatives and all relatives, by number and mean age
at diagnosis of ovarian cancers, number and mean age at
diagnosis of colorectal cancer, stomach and pancreatic
cancer, malignant melanoma, or uterine cancer. Although
none of the family history groupings gave a positive lod
score generally, they gave a positive score when the mean
age at onset of PC was early. We therefore hypothesised
that it might not be the family history of brain cancer that
was responsible for positive linkage to 1p36 but, instead,
the family history of early age at PC diagnosis per se.

Table 3 presents the linkage analysis results for the entire
ACTANE pedigree set subdivided according to mean age
at diagnosis of aVected men in the family. The four age
groups presented in table 3 were chosen to give
approximately equal representation and are listed from the
youngest (<59 years) to the oldest (>80 years). The large
negative lod score for all the families, −9.66, rejects overall
linkage to this region under the presumed genetic model of
Carter et al.4 However, NPL score (1.02, p=0.15) and
maximum hlod (0.93, alpha=0.24) are consistent with the
possibilities that either PC in a proportion of these families
is the result of an autosomal dominant gene located at
1p36, or that alternative genetic models better explain the
excess allele sharing among men with PC. Recessive and X
linked models have not yet been tested in our family set.
Over the three subgroups of families with the earliest mean
age at diagnosis, the sequential maximum lods (0.49,
−2.89, −5.78), NPL scores (1.60, 1.02, 0.13), and
heterogeneity lod scores (1.17, 0.59, 0.00) all indicate a

greater possibility of linkage the earlier the mean age at PC
diagnosis. The NPL score in the group with the earliest
mean age at diagnosis is close to being nominally
signiﬁcant (p=0.06), whereas for the other groups this
score is not signiﬁcant (p=0.15, 0.44, and 0.37, respec-
tively). Also, as mean age of PC diagnosis increased, the
estimated proportion of linked families decreased from
62% to 30% to 0%, also consistent with a general eVect
related to age at diagnosis. The group with the latest age at
diagnosis does not appear to follow this pattern, but there
are only 48 families in this class, and it might be expected
that there would be a higher proportion of phenocopies in
the upper liability class and this would decrease the power
to detect linkage in this group. Although the reasons for
this inconsistency are at present unclear, based on the
results in the three youngest age groups, we feel that early
age at diagnosis remains associated with an increased
probability of linkage.

Our families provided no evidence that the putative
familial prostate cancer locus, CAPB, at 1p361 is linked
with primary brain tumours, or indeed cancer at any site
other than the prostate. Although the ﬁve brain-prostate
families with early mean age at diagnosis of PC did parti-
tion overall lod and NPL scores, we consider that because
of the small number of families and the appearance of an
age linkage score association when the families were
subdivided by cancer at any site it remains unwarranted to
postulate that susceptibility to brain tumours is increased
by the inheritance of an altered gene in the 1p36 region. We
found a possible overall association of linkage scores with
mean age at diagnosis since families with earlier onset dis-
ease gave higher scores. Although not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, this result is similar to that found for HPC15 and
PCAP6 as well as with other familial cancers such as breast
and ovarian cancer.7 We note that table 6 of Gibbs et al1
suggested the possibility of linkage in 63 early onset PC
families in that the lod scores were positive when the
recombination fraction was 20% or more. However,
linkage was tested only at D1S407 and hlod scores were
not reported. Our maximum lod, NPL, and hlod scores
generally occurred 5 to 9 cM centromeric to this position,
so further analysis in this region in their PC family set
would be of interest. There are several possibilities for the
failure to detect linkage with the prostate cancer/primary
brain phenotype in our families. The ﬁrst is that the analy-
sis by Gibbs et al1 may have led to a false ﬁnding arising
from multiple subgroup analysis, which always has the risk
of showing signiﬁcant association by chance alone. The
other, more interesting possibility, from the gene hunting
perspective, is that it is not the primary brain phenotype
per se that is linked to this region, but rather early onset
PC, and it is this association with early onset disease which
is important.

Comorbidity of
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase and methionine synthase
gene polymorphisms and risk for
neural tube defects

EDITOR—Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most
common and devastating birth defects. NTDs result from
an incomplete closure of the neural tube, and include mal-
formations of the skull, brain, meninges, spinal cord, and
vertebral column. Recent evidence suggests that closure of
the neural tube occurs in ﬁve separate sites which then fuse
during the fourth week of gestation; NTDs occur when one
site fails to close or two sites fail to fuse.1

During the last decade, periconceptional folic acid sup-
plementation has been shown to reduce the risk of occur-
rence2 and recurrence3 of NTDs. Women with an NTD
aVected pregnancy do not usually have overt signs of folate
deﬁciency, although decreased erythrocyte folate concen-
tration, the index known to reﬂect whole body folate stores,
has been reported.4 5 In addition, it has been reported that
women with NTD pregnancies have raised homocysteine
concentrations in plasma and amniotic ﬂuid,6 7 suggesting
that folate metabolism may be altered in these women.

5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) ca-
talyses the reaction from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which serves as methyl donor for
the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.8 A substi-
tution (C to T) at the highly conserved nucleotide 677 of the
MTHFR gene has been described, which results in the con-
version of an alanine (Ala) to a valine (Val) residue and
increased in vitro thermolability of the enzyme.9 In vivo, the
thermolabile MTHFR mutant is known to result in raised
plasma homocysteine concentrations when folate nutriture
is inadequate.10 The frequency of homozygosity for this
mutation is approximately 9% for various populations, but is
higher in French Canadian, Italian, and Hispanic popula-
tions, and lower in African-American populations.9 11–13

The C677T mutation has been reported to be a genetic
risk factor for NTDs.11 14–17 However, the signiﬁcance of this
mutation as an NTD risk factor in diVerent populations has
recently been questioned. Speer et al20 found no evidence of
MTHFR C677T polymorphism as a risk factor
for
lumbosacral spina biﬁda in American white patients.
Weitkamp et al21 also reported that the C677T polymor-
phism in MTHFR was not associated with NTD risk in a
population of mixed ethnic origins. Papapetrou et al18 found
no evidence for an association between the 677T allele and
the incidence of NTDs in a British population. Similarly, in
French, German, and American populations, the distribu-
tion of the C677T mutation was the same in fetuses with
NTDs and controls.12 19 22 Ubbink et al23 reported that
homozygosity for the C677T mutation does not constitute a
genetic risk factor for NTDs in rural South African blacks.
The low frequency of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in
African-Americans,13 coupled with the lower incidence of
NTDs in blacks,24 suggests that analysis of the association
between MTHFR polymorphisms and NTD risk in a large
cohort of African-Americans would provide new infor-
mation relative to the importance of this association in this
population group. These investigations suggest that the fre-
quency of this mutation and its associated risk for NTD may
be population dependent or dependent on folate nutriture. It
is possible that the MTHFR mutation predisposes the fetus

949

J Med Genet 2000;37:949–951

to the development of NTDs, but they only occur if the
maternal and/or fetal folate status are suboptimal; hence,
periconceptional folic acid supplementation may overcome
this genetic defect. Therefore, a careful evaluation of the
eVect of polymorphism in association with folate nutriture is
warranted.

We recently reported that C677T MTHFR polymor-
phisms and raised homocysteine levels in amniotic ﬂuid
appeared to be disproportionately associated with NTDs
spanning the cervical-lumbar spine, lumbosacral spine,
and occipital encephalocele.25 26 These results suggest that
periconceptional folic acid supplementation may prevent
defects at these sites, but not at other sites of neural tube
closure.

The gene for human methionine synthase (MS), which
catalyses the reaction to form methionine from homo-
cysteine, has recently been cloned, and a common
polymorphism has also been identiﬁed.27–29 The polymor-
phism is an A to G substitution at base pair (bp) 2756,
converting an aspartic acid (Asp) residue into a glycine
(Gly). Although MS plays an important role in homo-
cysteine metabolism, this polymorphism has not been
reported to be a risk factor for NTD formation,30–33 and, to
our knowledge, comorbidity of MTHFR and MS polymor-
phisms for NTDs has never been evaluated. Potential
comorbidity of these enzymes may be of signiﬁcance
because MS and MTHFR are both key enzymes in homo-
cysteine metabolism, and altered homocysteine metabo-
lism has been implicated in the development of NTDs.6 7
We determined MTHFR and MS genotypes using DNA
isolated from amniotic ﬂuid cells of fetuses with NTDs and
of
those without any apparent malformations, and
evaluated potential associations between polymorphisms in
these two genes as a risk factor for the development of
NTDs. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birming-
ham. The computerised genetics database at the University
of Alabama Prenatal Genetics Clinic was used to identify
cases in which NTDs were diagnosed by ultrasound and
amniocentesis, and conﬁrmed by neonatal examination or
necropsy, between 1988 and 1997. Excess stored second
trimester amniotic ﬂuid samples from 82 women with
fetuses with conﬁrmed NTDs (cases) and from 84 women
with normal pregnancies (controls) were analysed. For
each case selected, we identiﬁed control samples obtained
from women who had undergone amniocentesis at the
same clinic but had a fetus conﬁrmed to be normal by
ultrasound, karyotype, and newborn examination. Each
acceptable control was randomly assigned a computer
generated priority number (SASS RANUI function) and
sorted accordingly. Samples were then retrieved from stor-
age according to their priority number; the ﬁrst adequate
sample located was selected as a control. Cases and
controls were matched for race, maternal age, and month
and year of amniocentesis. The case and control groups
each had a composition of 83% white, 16% African-
American, and 1% other. The mean (SD) maternal ages of
cases and controls were not signiﬁcantly diVerent (26.3
(SD 5.3) and 28.1 (SD 4.9) years, respectively).

The amniotic ﬂuid samples were collected aseptically
under ultrasound guidance by an experienced operator, and
were stored at −70(cid:176)C until analysis. A 200 µl aliquot of
amniotic ﬂuid was centrifuged for ﬁve minutes at 13 000 · g.
After removing 150 µl of supernatant, the remaining pellet
(50 µl) was suspended in 300 µl Cell Lysis Solution and
DNA was isolated (Puregene DNA Isolation Kit, Gentra
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Isolated DNA was resus-

pended in 25 µl Tris-EDTA buVer and stored at −20(cid:176)C until
analysis. The C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene was
determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁca-
tion of DNA using an exonic and intronic primer pair that
generates a 198 bp fragment.9 Thirty eight cycles of PCR
were performed for one minute at 94(cid:176)C, one minute at
60(cid:176)C, and two minutes at 72 (cid:176)C, followed by a 10 minute
elongation at 72(cid:176)C at the end of the cycles. The A2756G
polymorphism in the MS gene was determined by PCR
ampliﬁcation using a primer pair that generates a 189 bp
fragment.28 Thirty eight cycles of PCR were performed for
45 seconds at 95(cid:176)C, 35 seconds at 55 (cid:176)C, and 75 seconds at
72(cid:176)C. An aliquot of the PCR product was digested overnight
with HinfI restriction endonuclease (for detecting MTHFR)9
or with HaeIII (for detecting MS).28 The reaction products
were subjected to electrophoresis using a 1.8% agarose gel.
The homozygous normal MTHFR and MS alleles are not
digested by their
respective restriction endonucleases,
whereas the polymorphisms create recognition sequences
which are digested. The non-mutated (Ala/Ala) MTHFR
PCR product is 198 bp long. The homozygous mutant (Val/
Val) allele is thus digested completely by the enzyme and
gives a 175 bp fragment and a 23 bp fragment. The latter
runs oV the gel and is not visible after electrophoresis. The
heterozygous genotype (Ala/Val) yields both the 198 and 175
bp fragments upon HinfI digestion. Similarly, the non-
mutated (Asp/Asp), homozygous mutant (Gly/Gly), and
heterozygous (Asp/Gly) genotypes of MS yield 189, 159, and
189 plus 159 bp bands, respectively.

As shown in table 1, we found that the C677T Ala/Val or
Val/Val MTHFR genotype was more prevalent in NTD
cases than in controls. When Ala/Val and Val/Val genotypes
were combined, 48% of NTD cases had both alleles, com-
pared with 17% of controls. There was a 4.0-fold increased
risk for NTDs in fetuses having the Ala/Val genotype (95%
conﬁdence interval 1.8-8.8), and the risk increased to 6.6-
fold in fetuses with the Val/Val genotype (95% conﬁdence
interval 1.3-24.9). The fetal MS A2756G Gly/Gly and
Asp/Gly genotypes were not associated with risk of NTD
(table 1). Furthermore, we also found no association
between combined MTHFR and MS polymorphisms and
risk of NTDs (table 2).

Our ﬁndings using amniotic ﬂuid cells indicate that
fetuses homozygous or heterozygous for the C to T substi-
tution in the MTHFR gene are at increased risk for NTDs.
In order to compare our results to those of others, we sum-
marised the MTHFR genotype frequencies in previously
reported NTD cases from all studies with >50 subjects
(table 3). We selected studies with NTD cases exceeding
50 subjects. Our study, reporting the MTHFR genotype of
82 NTD cases and 76 controls, is the fourth largest study
in terms of the number of NTD cases. Our results are
similar to those of previous studies which suggested that
either homozygosity or heterozygosity for the C677T
mutation in the fetal MTHFR gene is a risk factor for
NTDs. A meta-analysis of the available data indicated that
homozygosity for the C677T mutation resulted in an
approximately two-fold increase of risk for NTDs.11 In the
study reported here, we found that NTD risk was increased
in fetuses having the Val/Val and Ala/Val genotypes. When
compared to previous studies, our odds ratios for both het-
erozygous and homozygous MTHFR C677T genotype fre-
quencies in NTD cases are higher than those previously
reported. The mechanism accounting for the higher ratios
is unknown, but may relate to the ethnic or geographical
composition or the folate nutriture of our study popula-
tion. Folate nutriture is mentioned here because previous
studies have shown that
folic acid supplementation
decreases the incidence of NTDs.2 3

Our ﬁnding of no association between the A2756G (Gly/
Gly) polymorphism in the MS gene and the occurrence of
the NTD phenotype is similar to that of van der Put et al,30
who reported that there is no increased prevalence of the
Asp/Gly or Gly/Gly genotypes in fetuses with NTDs or their
mothers. They found that the prevalence in controls of the
Asp/Asp, Asp/Gly, and Gly/Gly genotypes was 71%, 26%,
and 3%, respectively, which is similar to our values of 84%,
14%, and 3% in controls presented here. Shaw et al31 and
Morrison et al32 also reported that overall percentages of
Asp/Gly and Gly/Gly were not increased in infants with
NTDs. Christensen et al33 presented data suggesting that the
homozygous mutant genotype for the A2756G polymor-
phism in methionine synthase was associated with a reduced
risk for NTD in children. Given the importance of MS in
homocysteine metabolism, it is tempting to speculate that
during the course of evolution, some mutations of MS were
so deleterious that they were lethal to the fetus and were thus
not propagated.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst reported study of inter-
actions between frequently occurring polymorphisms of two
genes involved in folate metabolism. We did not ﬁnd strong
associations between MTHFR and MS polymorphisms and
the risk of NTDs. van der Put et al34 recently hypothesised
that combined heterozygosity for two common MTHFR
mutations may be an additional risk factor for NTDs. The
signiﬁcance, if any, of the weak MS/MTHFR associations
that we observed in this study requires further evaluation,
and possible confounding factors resulting from genetic
associations involved in folate metabolism as well as folate
nutriture may warrant further investigation.

In conclusion, our data support previous

studies
suggesting that the C677T mutation in MTHFR is associ-
ated with increased risk for NTDs. Although a common
polymorphism in the MS gene was not a strong risk factor
for NTDs, associations between MTHFR and MS
polymorphisms slightly increased the risk. Further research
is warranted to evaluate comorbidity of MTHFR and MS
polymorphisms in a large population.

Expression of HCM causing
mutations: lessons learnt from
genotype-phenotype studies of the
South African founder MYH7 A797T
mutation

EDITOR—Genotype-phenotype correlations provide an-
other perspective in studies seeking to identify the factors
that underlie the clinical variability that is a feature of sev-
eral inherited diseases. This approach has been particularly

J Med Genet 2000;37:951–956

revealing in investigations into the molecular causes and
phenotypic heterogeneity associated with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common inherited primary
cardiac disorder.1 2 Although, as
its name suggests,
hypertrophy may be a noticeable feature of the disease, it is
not invariant, nor does the degree of hypertrophy necessar-
ily correlate with the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD),
which is the most feared consequence of HCM.3 4

Molecular genetic investigations have shown that HCM
is caused by more than 100 distinct mutations in at least
seven diVerent sarcomeric protein encoding genes.5 When
the clinical features of HCM are correlated in a family
context with the speciﬁc disease causing gene and its asso-
ciated mutation, a recognisable pattern emerges. Essen-

tially, mutations in the cardiac ♢ myosin heavy chain gene
(MYH7) are more often associated with echocardiographi-
cally detectable to marked hypertrophy and a variable risk
of SCD, usually before the age of 35 years, which generally
relates to the speciﬁc causative mutation.6 In striking con-
trast, mutations in the cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2)
are most frequently accompanied by subtle, or even unde-
tectable, hypertrophy, yet confer a high risk of SCD in
adolescence or young adulthood.3 4 Between these ex-
tremes lie the myosin binding protein C gene mutations,
which are responsible for a considerably later age of onset
of a steadily progressive form of hypertrophy, which may
result in death from congestive heart failure later in life,
more often than SCD.7 8 Further studies are needed before
conclusive genotype-phenotype proﬁles can be deﬁned for
mutations in other HCM causing genes.9–11

This stratiﬁcation of HCM into distinguishable sub-
classes of disease has been used in prognostication and
management and counselling of patients with this
treatable, but currently incurable, disease. However, it is
generally advised that this approach be undertaken with
caution, as some phenotypic associations are based on lim-
ited patient numbers.12 Furthermore, there is concern that
data generated for one ethnic group cannot necessarily be
extrapolated to others.13 As a corollary, evidence suggests
that diverse genetic and environmental susceptibility
factors may modulate the expression of identiﬁed disease
causing mutations in the sarcomeric protein encoding
genes.14 15

We previously described a novel MYH7 mutation,
resulting in the substitution of a threonine (T) residue for
an alanine (A) residue at codon 797 (A797T), in two South
African HCM patients. Initial impressions, based on the
immediate family history of one of
these unrelated
subjects, were that this mutation was associated with a poor
prognosis and frequent SCD, thus prompting further
investigation.16 It was then found that both parents of the
proband carried the MYH7 A797T mutation. Concomi-
tantly, this mutation was identiﬁed in another seven appar-
ently unrelated members of a panel of South African HCM
patients. Subsequent haplotyping studies showed that the
MYH7 A797T mutation was a founder mutation extant in
South African subpopulation groups, where it accounted
for 25% of disease causes in a panel of HCM aVected
probands,17 making it even more important to investigate
its associated phenotype. These studies were further
warranted because the mutation carriers in the extended
families traced from these probands shared a common
ancestor and provided a large patient base in which to
establish genotype-phenotype correlations.

We show that the MYH7 A797T mutation is generally
associated with a favourable prognosis, but that it is impor-
tant to consider the inﬂuence of both genetic and environ-
mental modiﬁers on the disease proﬁle, when using
genotype-phenotype correlations in patient management
and counselling.

The study subjects were probands belonging to a panel
of South African HCM aVected subjects and their relatives
who could be traced. After obtaining informed consent
from subjects or legal guardians, DNA was extracted from
peripheral blood samples.18 The MYH7 A797T mutation
was detected by PCR based allele speciﬁc restriction
enzyme analysis.16 Mutation positive subjects were clini-
cally evaluated as described previously.14 Brieﬂy, echocar-
diographically determined end diastolic maximum left
ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) measurements were
obtained at the anterior interventricular septum (IVS) and
posterior wall (PW). Echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM
was made in the presence of an IVS >13 mm, in the
absence of confounding factors. Electrocardiographic

diagnosis of HCM was based on the presence of left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) according to the point sys-
tem of Romhilt and Estes19 or a signiﬁcant Q wave abnor-
mality. A family history and clinical records were obtained
to identify the range of symptoms noted in aVected
subjects and the number of disease related and sudden
cardiac deaths (SCDs) reported among the families
studied. The latter data were used to construct Kaplan-
survival curves.20 Based on the similarity of
Meier
phenotype and survival, the survival data from aVected
subjects in all the families, except those belonging to pedi-
gree 101, were pooled. Pedigree 101 was evaluated
separately because both parents in kindred 101a (ﬁg 1)
carried the MYH7 A797T mutation and previous haplo-
type studies had shown them to be related.17 Members of
the pedigrees are identiﬁed by a pedigree number preﬁx,
followed by the subject’s identiﬁcation numbers. The pre-
ﬁx SB identiﬁes probands from whom relatives could not
be traced. Pedigrees 101, 124, 131, and 138 were of white
descent, while pedigrees 104 and 110 and subjects SB902,
SB983, and SB995 were of ethnic admixture.17 In order to
ascertain that two brothers carrying the MYH7 A797T
their HinfI
mutation were monozygotic (MZ) twins,
digested DNA samples were analysed by Southern blot
hybridisation21 at hypervariable GTG genetic loci using the
(GTG)5 ﬁngerprinting probe.22

A total of 66 family members of six pedigrees (pedigrees
101, 104, 110, 124, 131, and 138, ﬁg 1) and three probands
(SB902, SB983, and SB995) were genotyped for the
MYH7 A797T mutation. Of these, 39 were mutation car-
riers (table 1), including both parents (1.II.2 and 1.II.3) of
the proband (1.III.6) of kindred 101a, within pedigree 101
(ﬁg 1). Additionally, three dead sibs of 1.III.6, namely
1.III.1, 1.III.3, and 1.III.5, were diagnosed with HCM at
necropsy, implying that they were likely to have inherited at
least one copy of the mutant allele from one of their carrier
parents. Of
these subjects, 1.III.1 was deﬁnitely a
heterozygous mutation carrier, as one of her fraternal twin
oVspring (1.IV.2) had inherited the mutation, while the
other (1.IV.1) had not. Similarly, dead subject 1.III.3 could
not have been a homozygous mutation carrier, as he also
had one non-carrier child (1.IV.3). No further assumptions
could be made about the carrier status of dead subject
1.III.5, who died childless. No living homozygous
mutation carriers were detected in this branch of pedigree
101.

Thirty ﬁve of the 39 living mutation carriers were clini-
cally examined, while 1.III.10, 4.II.3, 4.III.1, and 38.III.1
declined clinical investigation. Subjects 38.II.1, 38.II.6,
and 38.III.3 were assessed only by ECG and 4.I.1, 4.II.1,
and 10.I.1 only by echocardiography.

The mutation was associated with echocardiographically
detectable hypertrophy of the IVS (LVWT >13 mm) in 17
subjects (table 1), and although not to the same extent, the
left PW and/or apex were also abnormal, with measure-
ments of greater than 11 mm, in 11 of these subjects (table
1). Additionally, there were three mutation carriers whose
LVWT measurements were >11 but <13 mm. Moreover,
SB902 and SB983 had undergone myectomy to reduce
outﬂow tract obstruction, as well as mitral valve replace-
ment. The mean LVWT, calculated for all mutation carri-
ers >16 years, was 17.1 mm (SD 8.6), while the median
LVWT was 13 mm.

Blood pressure measurements were below 160/95 mm
Hg in 27 of the 29 mutation carriers for whom records
were available (table 1), with the exceptions being two
brothers, 31.III.6 and 31.III.8 (160/110 and 150/100 mm
Hg, respectively). Only three of these 29 mutation carriers
were receiving blood pressure lowering medication at the

time of the initial examination, namely, 31.III.6, who
suVered kidney disease, and 31.III.8 and 31.III.1.

Only four subjects had electrocardiographically detect-
able LVH, evaluated by the point system of Romhilt and
Estes19; these subjects had also shown an LVWT of >13
mm (table 1). Additionally, 1.III.6 had had a pacemaker
inserted. A further 12 subjects had other ECG abnormali-
ties often noted in HCM, while their LVWT values varied
between 10 and 40 mm. Of the remaining 15 subjects who
did not display any ECG abnormalities, nine also did not
meet the echocardiographic diagnostic criterion, while two
had not been investigated by echocardiography and three
were less than 16 years old (table 1).

Disease penetrance among all mutation carriers was
61% (19/35 subjects), based on subjects older than 16
years for whom an LVWT of >13 mm was measured (32
subjects, table 1) or who were diagnosed with HCM at
necropsy (three subjects).

The symptomatic presentation of mutation carriers var-
ied. Six of the 35 subjects for whom data were available
complained of syncope or presyncope (1.II.2, 1.II.8,
1.III.6, 1.III.8, 31.III.4, SB902), three experienced dys-
pnoea (1.II.3, 1.III.8, 4.II.1), four suVered palpitations
(1.II.8, 4.I.1, 31.III.1, 38.II.4), while six experienced both
dyspnoea and palpitations (1.III.6, 1.IV.2, 10.II.1, SB902,
SB983, SB995). Five subjects experienced angina (1.II.8,

angina and cardiac failure (1.II.3, 4.II.1, SB983). How-

tively. Three of their mother’s pregnancies had terminated
in spontaneous abortions and she suVered SCD while sed-
entary at the age of 58 years. In contrast, no sudden, or
disease related, deaths were known to have occurred in the
recent generations of any of the other pedigrees, including
the remainder of pedigree 101. In pedigree 131, one preg-
nancy in 31.II.3 had miscarried. The hypertensive father of
the proband in pedigree 138 had died at 58 years of myo-
cardial infarction, probably resulting from ischaemic heart
disease. The Kaplan-Meier product

survival of the subjects with the MYH7 A797T mutation
belonging to pedigree 101 and that of the rest of the fami-
lies with this mutation, as well as that of South African
families carrying the R92W mutation in TNNT2,3 are
shown in ﬁg 2. While survival in the other pedigrees was
unimpeded, survival in pedigree 101 was comparable to
that of subjects bearing the TNNT2 R92W mutation with
its previously described poor prognosis.3

Proband 38.II.4 (ﬁg 1) presented with chest pain and
palpitations at the age of 38 years. He showed an LVWT of
12.7 mm at both the IVS and the left PW, and while his
ECG tracings showed abnormal repolarisation and in-
creased voltages (table 1), they did not meet the diagnostic
criterion of LVH.19 However, taken together, the mild
LVH, non-speciﬁc ECG changes, and symptoms, were
likely to be HCM related. In contrast, his twin brother,
38.II.3, who was shown to be identical by band sharing on
GTG ﬁngerprinting, was symptom free, and exhibited an
LVWT of 10 mm at the PW and 9 mm at the IVS.
Although on ECG, 38.II.3 exhibited the same repolarisa-
tion abnormality and increased voltages as his twin, all
other parameters, including similar blood pressure values,
were normal. It was established from the proband’s history
that, while he had always been physically active, playing
rugby football in high school and continuing to participate
in competitive recreational cycling at the age of 38 years,
his twin brother had generally avoided sport and exercise.
In kindred 101a, three of the four oVspring of parents
1.II.2 and 1.II.3 had suVered SCD (ﬁg 1). These events
occurred in 1.III.1, 1.III.3, and 1.III.5 at 26 years, 24
years, and 17 years of age, while they were walking, playing
tennis, and during a period of heightened emotion, respec-
Table 1 Echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features present in subjects carrying the A797T MYH7 mutation

In this study, we have investigated the clinical phenotype
associated with the HCM causative MYH7 A797T muta-
tion in 35 mutation carriers, of whom 32 were members of
six diVerent apparently unrelated pedigrees, and three were
from families who could not be traced. The present study
shows that, although the initial impressions were to the
contrary,16 the MYH7 A797T mutation was generally
associated with a good prognosis and normal life span,
except in kindred 101a (ﬁgs 1 and 2).

However, despite the usually favourable prognosis, the
mutation was generally associated with echocardiographi-
cally detectable to overt hypertrophy, which was often
marked (table 1). Two mutation carriers, SB902 and

SB983, had undergone septal myectomy, to reduce outﬂow
tract obstruction resulting from their cardiac hypertrophy,
as well as mitral valve replacement. The mean (SD) LVWT
in all the pedigrees, excluding pedigree 101, was 17.8 (SD
8.7 mm), with a range of 8-40 mm for subjects over 16
years old (table 1). In pedigree 101, the mean (SD) LVWT
was similar to these values, namely 16.6 (SD 9.6 mm), with
a range of 9-36 mm, which was shown by ANOVA to have
no statistically signiﬁcant diVerence from the rest of the
families with this mutation.

When considering survival, the only exception to the
good prognosis associated with the MYH7 A797T
mutation was in pedigree 101. Here, the high frequency of
SCD was restricted to kindred 101a (ﬁgs 1 and 2), in which
haplotyping studies had previously indicated that the par-
ents of the proband, both of whom carried the MYH7
A797T mutation, shared a common ancestor.17 Three of
the four oVspring of the related mutation carrier parents in
kindred 101a had died suddenly, before the age of 27 years.
It is unlikely that these deaths resulted from a dosage eVect
of the mutant myosin protein, as at least two of them
(1.III.1 and 1.III.3) could not have been homozygous
mutation carriers by virtue of their non-carrier oVspring
(ﬁg 1). In contrast to the poor prognosis observed in
kindred 101a, the mutation was not associated with any
disease related deaths in the rest of pedigree 101, nor in the
other families carrying the MYH7 A797T mutation (ﬁgs 1
and 2).

The data generated from genotype-phenotype assess-
ments has led to speculation that HCM is not a simple
monogenic disorder, as frequently the clinical manifesta-
tions and course of the disease diVer even between subjects
in the same family.14 15 For example, in the present study,
there was marked variation in the degree of LVWT associ-
ated with the MYH7 A797T mutation within members of
the same pedigree (table 1), indicating that the phenotypic
expression of HCM causing mutations is modulated by
additional factors. Whether these factors are genetic or
environmental, and what
the interplay
between these factors and the major HCM causing muta-
tions are, has been a topic of discussion in recent
papers.15 23 24

the nature of

It can be speculated that the distinctive survival curve
seen in pedigree 101 may result from the inﬂuence of
genetic factors. In view of the shared ancestry of the
parents in the nuclear family, it is possible that their

oVspring, who were deduced not to be MYH7 A797T
homozygotes, may have been homozygous for susceptibil-
ity alleles at other loci that play a role in modulating
expression of the main disease causative gene. Further
support for the inﬂuence of deleterious homozygosity is
that while the proband, 1.III.6, the remaining living child
of parents sharing a common ancestor, showed overt septal
hypertrophy (36 mm), and had undergone pacemaker
implantation, his half brother, 1.III.8, showed moderate
hypertrophy (13 mm). However, as
the degree of
relatedness of the parents in kindred 101a could not be
established, this proposal remains speculative. It is unlikely
that environmental factors alone could account for the
malignant phenotype seen only in kindred 101a, as the
clinical course associated with the founder mutation was
benign in all other aVected families, whose individual
members were exposed to varied environments and life
style.

Evidence that environmental factors may also play a role
in modulating the expression of main locus HCM causing
mutations is provided by the divergent clinical presentation
associated with the MYH7 A797T mutation in the identi-
cal twin brothers in pedigree 138. Whereas, the physically
active twin, 38.II.4, was symptomatic and showed an
LVWT of 12.7 mm, with the hypertrophy appearing
concentric and concentrated around the apex, the LVWT
in his asymptomatic brother, 38.II.3, measured only 10
mm. Earlier studies have also documented heterogeneity in
the clinical expression of HCM in MZ twins,24 25 but this is
the ﬁrst report of MZ twins genotyped for a speciﬁc HCM
causing mutation, in which clinical diVerences may directly
relate to exercise. The inﬂuence of physical activity on the
expression of the hypertrophic phenotype in HCM has
been a cause of speculation, as exercise is known to
produce the hypertrophy seen in “athletes’ heart”.26 How-
ever, although these twins were considered genetically
identical, it cannot be excluded that epigenetic factors, or
indeed environmental inﬂuences other than exercise, could
also have played a role in the dissimilar development of
hypertrophy.

Currently, genotype-phenotype correlation studies pro-
vide the best available route to informed and accurate prog-
nosis for improved patient management and risk stratiﬁca-
tion, with the caveat that these correlations should be based
on substantial numbers of subjects drawn from the relevant
ethnic group. In addition, it may also be prudent to consider

the possible eVects of shared ancestry and exercise on the
clinical expression of a speciﬁc mutation, especially in
subpopulation groups with known founder eVects.

Although these examples of divergent phenotypic
expression in kindred 101a and the twins in pedigree 138
are based on small numbers, they lend support to the
notion that HCM is not a simple monogenic disorder and
that both genetic and environmental factors are modiﬁers
of the disease phenotype. A strategy followed in studies of
disease phenotypes with multifactorial aetiology is to
reduce the complexity of analysis by investigating geneti-
cally homogeneous subjects. The presence of the founder
MYH7 A797T mutation suggests
the families
harbouring it share a degree of common ancestry. We
therefore propose that the presence of this HCM causing
mutation with incomplete penetrance, in a substantial
group of related people, provides an opportunity to inves-
tigate the role of additional factors involved in the develop-
ment of the disease phenotype. Only when these factors are
known will the puzzling variability in the clinical expression
which is a feature of HCM mutations, and the true patho-
physiology of this disease, be understood.

Germline and somatic mosaicism in
achondroplasia

EDITOR—We describe a sib recurrence in achondroplasia
with parents of normal stature. Both aVected oVspring
carry the same causal mutation (G1138C) in the ﬁbroblast
growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Despite having no
clinical features of achondroplasia, a proportion of the
mother’s peripheral blood leucocytes also contained the
mutant FGFR3 allele. We conclude she is a germline and
somatic mosaic for achondroplasia and that both children
have inherited the condition from her. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed case of germline mosaicism in
achondroplasia.

J Med Genet 2000;37:956–958

Achondroplasia is the commonest form of short limbed
dwarﬁsm (birth incidence estimated at between 1:10 000
and 1:70 000)1 and is transmitted as an autosomal
dominant trait. As is often the case among dominant traits,
a high proportion of cases are new mutations but
achondroplasia is unusual in that the great majority are
caused by one of two mutations at the same nucleotide in
the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 gene (G1138A
transition and G1138C transversion).1 In common with
other FGFR3 mutations which cause skeletal dysplasia, the
pathogenic eVect of
the achondroplasia mutations is
thought to be altered mitogenesis and/or diVerentiation
owing to constitutive activation of the receptor.2 There is a
marked paternal age eVect in achondroplasia and it has
recently been shown that new mutations in achondroplasia
are almost exclusively of paternal origin.3 We received

peripheral blood DNA from a family with two children
with achondroplasia; both parents were of normal stature.
They had a total of four children of whom the second and
fourth were aVected. The mother was 27 years of age and
the father 53 years at the birth of their second aVected
child. Our ﬁrst thoughts in this case, taking into account
the age of the father, were that the aVected sibs were the
result of two independent new mutations in the paternal
germline, as would be expected to occur by chance as a
very rare event.

To determine the FGFR3 mutation(s) in the aVected
oVspring, blood was collected from the aVected children
and from both parents. DNA was extracted and exon 10 of
the FGFR3 gene was ampliﬁed and products were digested
with the restriction enzymes BfmI and MspI. The G1138A
transition creates a restriction site for BfmI whereas the
G1138C transversion creates a restriction site for MspI.
Analysis showed that both children were heterozygous for
the rare G1138C transversion. The father did not have the
mutation in his blood but, surprisingly, the mother did.
However, the ratio of the G1138C allele compared to the
wild type allele was less than the 1:1, which would be
expected for a straightforward heterozygote (ﬁg 1). The
relative proportion of the G1138C allele in the mother’s
blood leucocytes was determined using primer extension4
(ﬁg 1) followed by densitometry. The proportion of the
mutant allele in the mother was found to be 28%. She has
a height of 169 cm, span of 171 cm, upper segment/lower
segment 0.09, left hand 17.6 cm, and head circumference
of 58 cm. Apart from her slightly larger head size and mild
obesity her appearance is normal.

We conclude that, despite her normal appearance, the
mother is a germline and somatic mosaic for the G1138C
mutation and both her aVected children have inherited the
mutant allele from her. Given the mother’s relatively high
proportion of mutant alleles, her lack of phenotypic
expression is surprising; a hypochondroplasia-like pheno-
type, which is less severe than achondroplasia, might have
been expected. The most likely explanation for this is the
tissue speciﬁc distribution of the mosaicism, although the
mutant allele is present in 28% of her peripheral blood
leucocytes it may be at lower levels in her chondrocytes.

Germline and somatic mosaicism are both reasonably
common features of genetic disorders. For example, in
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and osteogenesis imper-
fecta, 15% and 6% of cases, respectively, inherit the con-
dition from a detectably mosaic parent.5 Germline mosai-
cism results from a mutation in gamete precursors which
then continue to divide, whereas combined germline and
somatic mosaicism arises when the mutation occurs very
early in development before the germline and somatic lin-
eages have separated. As achondroplasia is a common
condition which arises from a highly mutable nucleotide,
high frequencies of mosaicism might have been expected.
Surprisingly, the frequency of germline mosaicism as evi-
denced by sib recurrence is very low. A few cases of recur-
rence have been reported,5 6 but so infrequently that it has
been calculated that they could be accounted for by inde-
pendent mutations alone. Clinical reports of somatic
mosaicism in achondroplasia are also extremely rare.7 For
some reason, somatic and germline mosaics occur much
more rarely in achondroplasia than in many other
dominant traits. One possibility is that for reasons as yet
unclear, FGFR3 nucleotide 1138 is only hypermutable in
the male germline. Alternatively, there could be somatic
selection against cells carrying the mutant allele. Interest-
ingly, Apert syndrome, which is mainly caused by either of
two point mutations in FGFR2, also seems to have low
levels of germline mosaicism.5 This apparent
low
incidence of somatic mutation is at variance with recent

ﬁndings that somatic activating mutations of FGFR3 are
relatively common in multiple myeloma8 and carcinomas.9
However, all the FGFR3 mutations so far identiﬁed in
these malignant neoplasms are identical to activating
mutations that cause thanatophoric dysplasia. The greater
severity of this phenotype in comparison to achondro-
plasia is thought to be a reﬂection of the more strongly
activating nature of the thanatophoric dysplasia muta-
tions.10 That only these highly activating FGFR3 muta-
tions have so far been found in neoplasms may suggest
that the achondroplasia mutations, when they occur in
somatic cells, do not activate the receptor to a level that it
becomes oncogenic.

This is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed report of germline and
somatic mosaicism for an achondroplasia mutation.
FGFR3 nucleotide 1138 appears to be highly mutable in
the male germline, but somatic mutations resulting in
mosaicism are rare. The reasons for this discrepancy are
unknown but are clearly of importance to the understand-
ing of mutagenesis. The observation that the mother has a
normal appearance, despite a high proportion of the
achondroplastic allele in her somatic tissues, exempliﬁes
the ﬁne balance that the ﬁbroblast growth factors play in
morphological determination.

Achondroplasia with the FGFR3
1138gﬁ
a (G380R) mutation in two
sibs sharing a 4p haplotype derived
from their unaVected father

EDITOR—The study of achondroplasia, the most frequent
skeletal dysplasia in man, has contributed several impor-
tant insights into both developmental biology and human
genetics, such as the recognition of the paternal age eVect
for dominant mutations,1 2
the
importance of FGFR molecules in growth and develop-
ment,3 and the identiﬁcation of the nucleotide with the
highest mutation rate known so far in man, nucleotide
1138 of the FGFR3 gene.4 Most cases of achondroplasia
are associated with the gﬁa transition at nucleotide 1138
of FGFR3.4

indication of

the ﬁrst

In spite of the frequency of achondroplasia, the birth of
two or more children with achondroplasia to unaVected
parents is surprisingly rare, with only a few examples pub-
lished.5 6 One instance of half sibs with achondroplasia
born to the same father has been reported.7 In contrast,
observations of achondroplasia in people more distantly
related are relatively more common.8–10 Thus,
is
uncertain whether instances of achondroplasia in sibs born
to unaVected parents are caused by somatic mosaicism (as
suggested by the observation of three aVected sibs from
normal parents6 7) or by independent chance events.8
Undoubtedly,
germinal mosaicism for
achondroplasia must be orders of magnitude rarer than for
osteogenesis imperfecta or other dominant conditions.11

somatic or

it

Approximately, 90% of cases of achondroplasia are
caused by de novo mutations, and all de novo achondro-
plasia mutations studied so far were found to have
occurred on paternal chromosomes.12 We observed
achondroplasia with characteristic clinical and radio-
graphic signs in a brother and sister born to parents of nor-
mal stature, lacking any clinical sign of either hypochon-
droplasia or achondroplasia, aged 28 years (mother) and
25 years (father) at the time of birth of the ﬁrst child (ﬁg 1).
The family agreed to have the molecular mechanism of
recurrence investigated and consented to venepuncture
and buccal smears. Both children were heterozygous (in
the g1138a (G380R) FGFR3
leucocyte DNA)
mutation, while that mutation was not found in parental
leucocyte or buccal smear DNA by either SSCP analysis or
direct sequencing of PCR products. This made parental
somatic mosaicism unlikely.

Figure 1 Clinical appearance of the brother (right) and sister (left) with
achondroplasia aged 12 and 10 years, respectively.

To investigate the origin of the mutation shared by the
two aVected sibs, inheritance of VNTR alleles on chromo-
some 4p was studied (ﬁg 2). The aVected children had two
diVerent maternal haplotypes but shared a paternal 4p
haplotype encompassing the FGFR3 locus. As the FGFR3
g1138a mutation occurs exclusively on paternal chromo-
somes, and the aVected children had two diVerent
maternal 4p haplotypes, the most likely explanations for
these ﬁndings would be either two independent mutational
events occurring by chance on the same paternal
haplotype, or mosaicism at
level
(before meiosis I) in the father. Paternal sperm was not
available and the hypothesis of gonadal mosaicism could
not be further substantiated.

We conclude that recurrence of achondroplasia in this
family was associated with de novo mutational event(s)
occurring in the paternal germline, as is the case in
sporadic cases,12 but could not distinguish between
paternal gonadal mosaicism or the chance occurrence of
two independent mutation events.8 The apparent rarity of

Homozygous deletion of SHOX in a
mentally retarded male with Langer
mesomelic dysplasia

EDITOR—Langer mesomelic dysplasia (LMD) is a rare
skeletal dysplasia characterised by severe short stature
owing to shortening and maldevelopment of the mesomelic
and rhizomelic segments of the limbs. Associated malfor-
mations are rarely reported and intellect is normal in all
aVected subjects reported to date.1–5 The clinical observa-
tion has been made that the parents of subjects with LMD

J Med Genet 2000;37:959–964

often have short
stature, most commonly with the
associated clinical and radiographic appearances of Léri-
Weill dyschondrosteosis (DC).6 This dominantly transmit-
ted condition is characterised by moderate short stature
predominantly because of short mesomelic limb segments.
It is often associated with the Madelung deformity of the
wrist, comprising bowing of the radius and dorsal disloca-
tion of the distal ulna. This observation has led to the sug-
gestion that LMD is the homozygous expression of the
mutant gene for DC.5 6

Shears et al7 and Belin et al8 recently showed that the
molecular defect in DC is mutation within or deletion of
the SHOX gene located within the primary pseudoauto-
somal region of the X and Y chromosomes. Deletion or

mutation of SHOX has also been shown to lead to short
stature without overt bone dysplasia.9 10 Belin et al8
documented the molecular analysis of a 24 week fetus of a
female patient with DC and a pseudoautosomal deletion
encompassing SHOX. The fetus had a 45,X karyotype and
the radiographic appearances of LMD. They showed that
the SHOX locus
the Xp chromosomal haplotype at
retained by this fetus was the maternal one, encompassing
the deleted SHOX gene, rendering the fetus nullizygous for
SHOX. Shears et al7 reported that deletions of SHOX alle-
les were derived from both parents in a 20 week fetus with
radiographic appearances of LMD. These ﬁndings in
fetuses were the ﬁrst molecular evidence to support
nullizygosity for SHOX as the cause of LMD; however,
molecular conﬁrmation in a living patient with LMD has
not been previously described.

We present a description of a mentally retarded boy with
LMD and his parents, both of whom have DC and normal
intellect. Molecular analysis shows that each parent is
hemizygously deleted at the SHOX locus and that the
proband has inherited both alleles harbouring the dele-
tions, conﬁrming this as the aetiology of LMD.

The patient, a male, was the ﬁrst born child to
non-consanguineous parents both of whom had short stat-
ure (ﬁg 1, III.1). He was delivered by caesarean section for
fetal distress at 35 weeks’ gestation. He was in good condi-
tion immediately after delivery. His birth weight was 1480
g (−2.6 SD), length was 33 cm (−4.3 SD), and OFC was
28 cm (−3 SD). Severe rhizomelic and mesomelic shorten-
ing of all four limbs was immediately obvious on delivery
and subsequent radiographic ﬁndings were consistent with
LMD (ﬁg 2). He required gavage feeding for two weeks
and developmental progress in the ﬁrst two years of life was
appreciably delayed with expressive language being par-
ticularly slow to develop. At review aged 12 years he
remained severely mentally retarded. He had no speech,
was not toilet trained, and could only assist in dressing by
raising his hands and feet. He was ambulatory but walked
with a swaying gait and with ﬂexion at the hips to retain
balance. In the year before review he had developed gener-
alised seizures which were satisfactorily controlled with
valproate. He was 97 cm tall (−7.2 SD) with a weight of 17
kg (−3.6 SD) and OFC of 49.5 cm (−3.0 SD). There was
marked rhizomelic and mesomelic shortening of all limbs
(ﬁg 3). The hands and feet were of normal size, although
there was partial soft tissue syndactyly and camptodactyly
of digits 2-5, and clinodactyly of the ﬁfth digits bilaterally
in the hands. Both hands showed ulnar deviation at the
wrists and both big toes were proximally placed. There

were no other anomalies present except for a large gap
between the central maxillary incisors and a mild pectus
excavatum deformity. There was no mandibular hypopla-
sia. Pubertal status was Tanner stage 3.

Investigations have included a normal CT scan of the
brain at 3 years and an interictal EEG performed at 13
years, which showed no frank epileptiform activity or
asymmetry although there was a marked excess of theta
activity and no well deﬁned alpha rhythm. Results of a
karyotype, fragile X molecular testing, and urine organic
acid proﬁle were normal.

The father of the proband (II.4) was 162 cm tall (−2.3
SD) and the mother (II.5) was 145 cm (−2.7 SD). Both
parents were of normal intellect. They had short arms and
legs, most pronounced in the mesomelic segments. A bilat-
eral wrist deformity was clinically present
in both,
comprising a subluxation of the distal ulna and resulting in
a mild limitation in supination. The mother’s deformity
was more pronounced than that of the father. Radiographs
showed a Madelung deformity with bowing and thickening
of the middle third of the radii (ﬁg 4). The couple’s second
pregnancy, a male (III.2), had been terminated in the sec-
ond trimester owing to detection of severely shortened
limbs on ultrasound. No necropsy was performed. A
brother of the proband (III.3), aged 6 years, was noted to
be of normal intellect, 112.3 cm tall (−0.7 SD), and to have
normal body proportions. Multiple members of

Figure 6 FISH studies with cosmid 34F5. (A) The mother of the proband (II.5), showing a deletion on one X chromosome. (B) The father of the
proband (II.4), showing a signal on the X and the Y chromosomes. (C) The proband (III.1) showing a deletion on the X chromosome but a signal on the
Y. (D) The maternal uncle of the proband (II.6) showing a deletion on the Y chromosome and a retained signal on the X (arrowed).

Results showed that the proband (III.1) did not inherit an
allele at the DXYS233 locus from his mother (II.5),
indicating a maternal PAR1 deletion (ﬁg 5A). A paternally
derived allele at DXYS233 was present. No PCR product
was obtained with the proband’s DNA for the SHOX CA
repeat, and the parents could both be either hemizygous or
homozygous at this locus. In addition, since the proband’s
DNA failed to amplify with primers for each exon of
SHOX (ﬁg 5B), we concluded that there was a homozygous
deletion encompassing SHOX in the proband. Heterozy-
gosity in the proband for the more proximal PAR1 micro-
satellite markers DXYS6814, DXYS228, and DXYS230
indicates that neither deletion extends into the X speciﬁc
region, but both are conﬁned to the pseudoautosomal
region. The normal brother of the proband (III.3) has
inherited the opposite maternal and paternal haplotypes to
the proband.

FISH was performed on metaphase spreads of lym-
phocytes obtained from whole blood or from transformed
lymphoblastoid lines.11 Cosmid LLNOYCO3’M’34F5,
which contains SHOX exons 1-5b, was obtained from the
Lawrence Livermore Y chromosome speciﬁc library and
was labelled by nick translation with biotin-16 dUTP
(Gibco BRL BioNick Labeling System). A total of 15 meta-
phases were analysed using a Leitz DMLB ﬂuorescence
microscope and images were captured and stored using
Applied Imaging software. A hemizygous deletion of
SHOX was shown in the mother (ﬁg 6A). However, in the
father, signals were visible on both the X and Y
chromosomes
(ﬁg 6B) and in the proband an X
chromosome deletion was present but there was a signal on

the Y (ﬁg 6C). We therefore performed Southern blotting
to show the paternally derived SHOX deletion.

A Southern blot of HindIII digested genomic DNA of
II.4, II.5, III.1, and III.3 was hybridised with a probe for
SHOX exons 3 to 4. The blot was then stripped and rehy-
bridised with a dosage control probe from chromosome 22
(TBX1, IMAGE cDNA clone 1876034). Probe labelling
and detection was performed using the Gene ImagesTM
system (Amersham). There was no signal with the SHOX
probe in the proband, III.1 (upper panel, ﬁg 7), but the
dosage control probe signal was present (lower panel, ﬁg
7), conﬁrming that the proband is homozygously deleted
for SHOX. A dosage eVect was shown with the SHOX
probe in the parents of the proband, II.4 and II.5. These
lanes both showed a weaker intensity signal than the
normal sib, III.3. The dosage control probe showed equal
signals

been considered the homozygous expression of DC on
purely clinical grounds, but until the demonstration of the
molecular defect underlying the disorder, deﬁnitive
evidence has been lacking. This report
is the ﬁrst

Figure 7 Southern blot of HindIII digested genomic DNA of II.4, II.5,
III.1, and III.3 hybridised with a SHOX probe (genomic PCR product of
SHOX exons 3 to 4). The probe detects a 2.9 kb band which is absent in
III.1, indicating a homozygous deletion (upper panel). The band strength
in III.3 is of greater intensity than in II.4 and II.5, whereas the control
probe hybridises to a 2 kbband and shows equal signal intensity in all
lanes (lower panel). This dosage eVect shows that II.4 and II.5 are
heterozygous for SHOX deletions.
The SHOX gene is

located within the primary
pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) at the telomere of the
short arm of the X and Y chromosomes. This region
escapes X inactivation in females and participates in obli-
gate recombination during male meiosis. Consequently,
DC segregates as an apparently “autosomal” dominant
disorder. This is illustrated by the normal statured male sib
of the proband who has inherited the two intact SHOX
alleles, the paternal Y chromosome having undergone mei-
otic recombination with a breakpoint centromeric to the
SHOX locus. The obligate requirement for crossing over in
PAR1 may predispose to a higher rate of mispairing with
resultant deletions in this very localised chromosomal
region. An accurate estimation of the frequency of such
events is diYcult since it is likely that DC is underdiag-
nosed within the general population owing to the wide
clinical spectrum. Analysis of the small number of patients
with DC examined with molecular methods so far has
indicated that deletion is a common mode of mutation in
this disorder. The studies of Shears et al7 and Belin et al8
showed that 12 out of 14 cases were the result of deletions
encompassing the SHOX locus, the remaining two being
point mutations.

It is interesting to note that there are no previous reports
of an association of mental
retardation with LMD,
although it has been described previously in association
with DC. Shears et al7 noted minor dysmorphic features
and learning disabilities in a pair of female monozygotic
twins with DC. They postulated that
this might be
explained by deletion of contiguous genes; however, in this
case the responsible deletion encompassing the SHOX

chondrodysplasia punctata. Molecular mapping studies
showed the extent of the maternally derived deletion to
include not only SHOX, but also ARSE, the gene mutated
in X linked chondrodysplasia punctata, and the putative
mental retardation locus MRX49. The normal intelligence
and seizure free status of the mother suggests that the phe-
notype of her son was attributable to heterozygosity for the
SHOX deletion in addition to nullizygosity for ARSE and
possibly MRX49.14 Thus in both these cases the deletion
extended well into the X speciﬁc region and could include
established MRX loci. Microsatellite and cytogenetic
analysis of the deletions in the present case have indicated
that the maternal deletion is more extensive than the
paternal deletion, but is still conﬁned within PAR1 and
does not extend into the X speciﬁc region. Several MRX
loci map close to PAR1,15 but to our knowledge none has
been reported within PAR1. It is still possible that deletion
of contiguous genes may contribute to the mental retarda-
tion in the proband of this family if one postulates the
existence of a further MRX/Y locus within the pseudoau-
tosomal region. It is worthwhile noting that the parents and
other relatives aVected by DC do not have intellectual
impairment suggesting that the MR resulting from this
putative pseudoautosomal gene follows recessive inherit-
ance in this family. In addition, none of the patients from
other DC families studied with microdeletions conﬁned to
PAR1 have mental retardation. It is likely that most LMD
patients without mental retardation are homozygously
deleted for SHOX but that one or both of the deletions do
not encompass the putative MRX/Y locus. They could also
carry one or more point mutations which would not be
expected to cause mental retardation.

The study of this patient shows that nullizygosity for
SHOX causes Langer mesomelic dysplasia and conﬁrms it
as the homozygous form of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis.
The association of LMD with mental retardation in this
patient also suggests the existence of a recessively acting
pseudoautosomal mental retardation locus.

Tandem triplication of chromosome
13q14 with inverted interstitial
segment in a 4 year old girl

EDITOR—Application of chromosome painting has enabled
conﬁrmation that an additional segment in a presumed
tandem duplication originates from the rearranged chro-
mosome. More recent studies to determine more accu-
rately the exact amount of duplication with cosmid FISH
probes have, in a few instances, shown that some of the
presumed duplications were in fact triplications of smaller
segments.1–7 In some of these patients, unequal distances
between the FISH signals showed that the middle segment
of the tandemly arrayed three segments was in the opposite
orientation to the two ﬂanking segments,1 3 4 thus providing
clues to the possible mechanism of formation.

Here we report on the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecu-
lar analysis of a patient displaying the same type of triplica-
tion for segment 13q14 including the retinoblastoma gene,
again with opposite orientation of the middle segment.

The proband was born at term after an uneventful preg-
nancy to healthy, consanguineous, Turkish parents (third
cousins). At the birth, the mother was 23 and the father
was 28 years old. The patient’s birth weight was 2700 g
(<10th centile). At the age of 4 years, she was referred to a
paediatric hospital for evaluation of developmental delay.
Her weight (8 kg), height (85.0 cm), and head circumfer-
ence (43.5 cm) were all far below the 3rd centile. Her cog-
nitive abilities were estimated to be at the level of a 2 year
old (IQ of about 50). Clinical assessment showed the
following ﬁndings (ﬁg 1): low frontal hairline, prominent
antihelices and hypoplastic lobules of the ears, upward
slanting palpebral ﬁssures, deep set eyes, a capillary
haemangioma next to the right eyebrow, a bulbous nasal

tip, thin upper lip, pointed chin, excessive dental caries,
right transverse palmar crease, diminished ﬂexion in the
metacarpophalangeal joints of both thumbs, and hypertri-
chosis of the legs.

Chromosome analysis was performed on GTG banded
metaphase preparations of blood lymphocyte cultures of
the patient and her parents by standard techniques.

FISH was carried out using probes from four loci on
chromosome 13 according to standard protocols (Oncor®
Inc) or as previously described.8 9 Loci and their corre-
sponding cosmid probes included D13S118 (c118), the
retinoblastoma gene RB1, D13S319 (c319), and D13S25
(c25), all mapping to 13q14. Cosmid c118 maps to
13q14.1-q14.2 proximal to RB1, while cosmids c319 and
c25 both map to 13q14.3 about 1 Mb distal to the RB1
locus.10

FISH analysis was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan
epiﬂuorescence microscope and images were recorded
either by conventional microphotography or by Photomet-
rics CCD KAF camera (Tuscon, AZ, USA), controlled
with Smart Capture imaging software (Vysis Inc, Downers
Grove, IL, USA).

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of
the proband and her parents by standard methods. PCR
analysis was performed using primers which amplify dinu-
cleotide repeat polymorphisms. The following loci which
map between bands 13q12 and 13q32-q34 were tested:
D13S221, D13S218, D13S118, D13263, D13S155,
D13S284, D13S153, D13S137, D13S124, D13S162,
D13S170, and D13S173. PCR products were separated on
a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel and visualised by silver
staining.

GTG banding analysis of

the patient’s metaphase
spreads
(resolution of about 400-500 bands/haploid
karyotype) showed a female karyotype with 46 chromo-
somes in all 30 cells examined. One homologue 13 showed
an approximate 1/4-1/3 increase in length owing to an
additional segment in the middle of the long arm. Two
narrow bands divided the additional segment into three
equal parts, suggesting a triplication of band 13q14 (ﬁg 2).
The karyotypes of both parents were normal.

Hybridisation with the RB1 gene probe showed one sig-
nal on the normal chromosome and three signals and thus
three RB1 copies on the rearranged homologue. The
distances between the three signals appeared to be
unequal; the distance between the ﬁrst and second signals
seemed to be shorter than that between the second and
third signals. Cohybridisation of the RB1 gene probe with
diVerently labelled cosmids c25 or c319, as well as
cohybridisation of cosmids c118 and c319, conﬁrmed an
interstitial triplication of the whole of band 13q14 (ﬁg 2).
In addition, dual colour FISH clearly showed that the mid-
dle segment was inverted in orientation; the order of signals
was RG-GR-RG or GR-RG-GR (R stands for red; G
stands for green). An order of RG-RG-RG or GR-GR-GR
would be expected if the triplication had occurred in direct
orientation. Unequal distance between three pairs of
signals, with the ﬁrst two in a row being very close, but both

FISH and DAPI banding (=850 bands/karyotype) placed
the RB1 locus at 13q14.2. Combining the pattern of GTG
bands with the results of DAPI banding, the proximal

stronger than the maternal band. At locus D13S263, which

stronger than the maternal one (data not shown). Normal
biparental inheritance of loci proximal (D13S221) and
distal (D13S170, D13S173) to 13q14 was seen. These
results indicate that the triplication of 13q14 was paternal
in origin and that both paternal chromosomes 13 were
involved in its formation.

Clinical observations suggest that, in general, tetrasomy
of an autosomal segment causes a similar, but more severe
clinical picture than trisomy of the same segment. This has
been shown, for example, for 9p, 18p, and 15(q12-q13).1 11
Further, for some segments (8p, 12p) tetrasomy is viable
only in a mosaic state while trisomy without mosaicism is
compatible with survival. No other patients with tetrasomy
for segment 13q14 are yet known. Trisomy of this segment
was only detected following cytogenetic investigation of
families with several members aVected with retinoblast-
oma; unbalanced familial insertional translocations result-
ing in 13q14 deletion caused retinoblastoma while those
resulting in 13q14 duplication caused a very mild clinical
phenotype or even no anomalies.12–14 The patients were
described as either having “no deﬁnite clinical syn-
drome”,12 being normal,13 or normal with short stature.14
Thus, the mild but still distinct phenotype of our proband
with triplication as compared to the above mentioned cases
with duplication of 13q14 is in accordance with the previ-
ous observations with other chromosomal
segments.
Duplication of a larger segment (13q12-q22) including
13q14 was also found in family investigations because of
familial occurrence of retinoblastoma.15 Not unexpectedly
because of the larger size of the duplication, these patients
showed mild dysmorphism and mild to moderate mental
retardation. Patients with a proximal duplication,
dup(13)(pter-q14/q21), show a non-speciﬁc pattern of
mostly minor anomalies and moderate mental retardation,
while patients with a distal 13q duplication including
13q14, for example, dup(13)(q14ﬁqter), show multiple
congenital anomalies including postaxial polydactyly and
profound mental retardation.16

note that in several cases an unequal distance between two
FISH signals (the proximal and the middle versus the mid-
dle and the distal) indicated that either the middle segment
was inverted or, less likely, the middle segment was in nor-
mal orientation, but the proximal and distal segments were
inverted,1 4 6 probably, according to the illustrations, the
cases of Rauch et al2 and Harrison et al3 and the present
report. In the other patients, no special attention was paid
to the issue of direct versus inverted triplication. In the case
of direct orientation of all three segments, the distances
between the signals should be of equal length; however,
even in the case of an inverted middle segment, the
distances would only be of equal length if the FISH probes
map to the middle of the triplicated segment at equal dis-
tances from the two ends.

It is likely that a proportion of cases of segmental tripli-
cation are incorrectly interpreted as duplication while in
fact there is triplication of a smaller segment. This could
also account for part of the phenotypic variability observed
between such patients with presumed similar phenotypes,
especially with respect to interstitial segments for which
there are few familial insertional translocations and thus
proven instances of duplication. Banded chromosome
analysis alone will in very few cases allow discrimination
between duplication and triplication. We therefore propose
that FISH studies using probes mapping to the presumed
duplicated segment should constitute part of the diagnos-
tic work up following determination of a tandem duplica-
tion through banded chromosome examination and
chromosome painting with whole chromosome probes.

loss of

While direct or inverted tandem duplications could be
formed through unequal crossover or unequal
sister
chromatic exchange,18 triplications of this kind require a
more complex mechanism of origin. For a case of triplication
of 15q11-q13, meiotic recombination between an inv
dup(15)(q13) chromosome and a normal 15 with subse-
the marker was proposed.1 A similar
quent
mechanism has also been proposed to explain ampliﬁcation
of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in Chinese
hamster cells.19 Another possible mechanism would be that
the parent from whom the aberration stems (in our case the
father) would either carry a constitutional paracentric inver-
sion of the triplicated segment or such an inversion would be
formed in a prezygotic cell. Although banded chromosome
examinations of the father of our proband yielded normal
results, a paracentric inversion of just 13q14 could not be
excluded unless bicolour FISH studies were performed,
which in this case was not possible. Two crossovers within
the inversion loop with a U type exchange would result in a
tandem triplication with an inverted middle segment.

This type of triplication has so far been reported for the
following chromosomal segments: 2q11.2-q21,7 2q37,2
5p14-p15.33,3 7p21.2-p21.3,4 9p13-p22,5 10q26,6 13q14

The ﬁrst three mosaic cri du chat
syndrome patients with two rearranged
cell lines

EDITOR—Cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) is one of the more
common deletion syndromes, involving the short arm of
chromosome 5, with an incidence of 1 in 50 000 live births.
Classically, patients with this syndrome present with
microcephaly, a round face, hypertelorism, micrognathia,
prominent nasal bridge, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, and
severe psychomotor retardation. Infants also exhibit a high
pitched cry similar to the mewing of a cat, which is usually
this syndrome.1 2 Recently,
considered diagnostic for
genotype-phenotype studies in CdCS led to the identiﬁca-
tion of two separate chromosomal regions, hemizygosity
for which is associated with speciﬁc phenotypes.3 A
deletion of 5p15.3 results in the manifestation of a cat-like
cry4, while a deletion of 5p15.2 results in the presentation
of the other major clinical features of the syndrome.5
Moreover, a region for speech delay in 5p15.3 has been
identiﬁed.6

From a review of 331 published cases, Niebuhr2
estimated that most CdCS cases are the result of de novo
deletions (about 80%), some derive from a familial
rearrangement (12%), and only a few show other rare
cytogenetic aberrations, such as mosaicism (3%), rings
(2.4%), and de novo translocations (3%). Chromosomal
mosaicism in CdCS has been described involving a cell line
with a 5p deletion and a cell
line with a normal
karyotype.2 7

We describe the ﬁrst three reported cases of mosaic de
novo 5p anomalies involving two rearranged cell lines in
CdCS out of 80 (3.75%) patients from the Italian Register
of CdCS8 analysed in a large study of correlation between
5p deletion and phenotypic eVect (Cerruti Mainardi et al,
manuscript in preparation).

Patient 1 was the ﬁrst female child of healthy, unrelated
parents. At birth the mother was 29 and the father 31 years
old. The pregnancy was complicated by a threatened mis-
carriage in the 12th week of gestation. There had been no
exposure to alcohol, nicotine, drugs, x rays, or teratogens
during pregnancy. Her younger sister was healthy. The
family history was unremarkable.

The baby was born by caesarean section because of
reduced uterine contractions in the 39th week of gestation.
Apgar scores were 7 and 6 at one and ﬁve minutes, respec-
tively. Her birth weight was 2750 g (10th-25th centile),
length was 48 cm (25th centile), and head circumference
was 34 cm (25th-50th centile).

The neonatal course was complicated by transient respi-
ratory distress and metabolic acidosis. In the ﬁrst days of
life, sucking diYculties were reported, requiring nasogas-

tric feeding. Neonatal physical examination showed
epicanthic folds and hypertelorism. CdCS was suspected
because of an abnormal cry and was conﬁrmed by
cytogenetic analysis. No signiﬁcant medical
illness was
observed during infancy.

On physical examination at the age of 6 years, weight was
20.7 kg (50th centile), height was 114.5 cm (50th centile),
and head circumference was 49 cm (3rd-10th centile).
Clinical features included a high voice, downward slanting
palpebral ﬁssures, broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism,
epicanthic folds, slight micrognathia, slightly low set ears,
diastasis recti, and ﬂat arches of the feet. Dysmorphism was
felt to be mild (ﬁg 1A).

However, developmental delay, evaluated with the Den-
ver Developmental Screening Tests,9 was present: she sat
with her head steady at 6 months, sat without support at 10
months, and walked well at 2 years. Speech delay was more
severe; she spoke her ﬁrst words at 4 years and could com-
bine two diVerent words at 6 years.

Chromosome analysis of the patient, performed on
peripheral blood lymphocytes, showed two cell lines; in
73% of cells a 5p deletion was observed and in 27% of cells
a 5p duplication was observed.

FISH analysis performed with speciﬁc single locus DNA
lambda phage probes spanning 5p10 identiﬁed breakpoints
both on the deleted chromosome 5 and on the duplicated
one. The breakpoint on the deleted chromosome 5 is in
p14.1 between D5S769 and D5S711 and the breakpoints
on the duplicated chromosome 5 are in p15.2 between
D5S778 and D5S751 and in p12 between D5S802 and the
centromere. The duplication is inverted.

The cytogenetic and FISH results are summarised in ﬁg
1B and C. In conclusion the karyotype was interpreted as:
46,XX,ish del(5)(:p14.1ﬁqter)(D5S711-)[73]/46,XX,ish
dup(5)(:p12ﬁp15.2::p15.2 ﬁqter)(D5S802++, D5S778
++, D5S751-)[27]. The parents’ and sister’s karyotypes
were normal.
Molecular

analysis performed with microsatellite
D5S211411 indicated the paternal origin of the deleted and
the duplicated chromosomes 5.

Patient 2 was the ﬁrst female child of healthy, unrelated
parents. At birth the mother was 26 and the father 31.
Pregnancy was complicated by bleeding in the ﬁrst 12
weeks; ultrasound examination showed intrauterine
growth retardation. There was exposure to nicotine during
pregnancy (15 cigarettes a day). The family history was
remarkable for two deaf maternal aunts.

The baby was delivered in the 40th week of gestation. Her
birth weight was 2680 g (3rd-10th centile); length and head
circumference were not recorded. The neonatal course was
complicated by metabolic acidosis. Cytogenetic analysis,
performed in another laboratory because of dysmorphism,
showed a karyotype with three cell
lines: 46,XX,del(5)
(p15)[65]/46,XX[33]/46,XX,dup(5)(p13ﬁpter) [2].

Chromosome analysis of the patient, performed on

76% of cells a 5p deletion was observed and in 24% of cells
a chromosome 5 with normal dimensions and banding

FISH analysis performed with speciﬁc single locus DNA
lambda phage probes spanning 5p10 established that the

apparently normal chromosome 5 really represented a 5p
duplication and identiﬁed breakpoints both on the deleted
and the duplicated chromosomes 5. The breakpoint on the

The baby was delivered at 40 weeks of gestation. Her
birth weight was 2600 g (3rd -10th centile), length was 50
cm (50th-75th centile), and head circumference was 33 cm
(10th-25th centile). CdCS was suspected because of
dysmorphism, microcephaly, and a high pitched monoto-
nous cry and was conﬁrmed by cytogenetic analysis.
Talipes of the left foot was observed.

At the ages of 31⁄2 and 51⁄2 she underwent two operations
for left cholesteatoma. During infancy her psychomotor
development, evaluated with Denver Developmental
Screening Tests,9 was delayed; she was able to grasp objects
at 8 months, to sit at 2 years, to say her ﬁrst words at 3
years, and to walk at 31⁄2 years. Menarche occurred at 11
years.

On physical examination at 12 years, her weight was 40
kg (50th centile), height was 137 cm (<3rd centile), and
head circumference was 48 cm (<3rd centile). Clinical fea-
tures included a high voice, epicanthic folds, divergent
strabismus, micrognathia, a high arched palate, slightly low
set ears, incomplete bilateral ﬂexion creases, diastasis recti,
ﬂat arches of the feet, and talipes of the left foot (ﬁg 3A).
She showed severe mental and speech delay and hyperac-
tive behaviour.

Chromosome analysis of the patient, performed on
peripheral blood lymphocytes, showed two cell lines with
diVerent 5p deletions: in 78% of cells the deletion extended

from pter to p13 and in 22% of cells the deletion extended
from pter to p14.3.

FISH analysis performed with speciﬁc single locus DNA
lambda phage probes spanning 5p10 allowed ﬁner deﬁnition
of the extent of the deletions. The breakpoint on the more
deleted chromosome 5 is in p13 between D5S743 and
D5S787 and the breakpoint on the less deleted chromo-
some 5 is in p14.3 between D5S699 and D5S796. The

In conclusion,

In summary, as a consequence of these rearrangements
of chromosome 5p, at least in peripheral blood lym-
phocytes, patients 1 and 2 have a partial monosomic cell
line and a partial monosomic/trisomic cell
line, while
patient 3 shows two diVerent partial monosomies.

It is interesting to analyse the CdCS phenotype of
patients 1 and 2 in relation to the presence of partial
trisomy 5p in a proportion of cells. Partial trisomy 5p was
ﬁrst described in 1964,12 but it is a very rare event. Most
partial trisomies 5p are the consequence of an unbalanced

translocation with another autosome. However, although
some manifestations may diVer from case to case because
of the eVect of the monosomy of the other chromosome
involved in the translocation, a clinically recognisable and
consistent phenotype is always present and is apparently
little inﬂuenced by the presence of concomitant autosomal
imbalance. The most common manifestations are normal
birth weight, macrodolichocephaly, downward slanting
palpebral ﬁssures, epicanthus, bulbous nose, low set ears,
short big toes, hypotonia, seizures, and psychomotor retar-
dation. Multiple congenital anomalies are present and early
death is frequent.13–19 The extent of the clinical ﬁndings in
the reported cases depends on the length of the trisomic
portion. The larger the trisomy, the more pronounced are
the clinical signs. Physical signs are almost absent when
5p14-ter is involved, while those cases with trisomies of
chromosome material
including 5p13 or the complete
short arm have more severe multiple congenital anomalies,
mental retardation, and growth failure.20 Signs and malfor-
mations described in patients with partial monosomy 5p
and in patients with partial trisomy 5p compared to those
observed in patients 1 and 2 are summarised in table 1.

Of particular interest are the mild phenotype in patient 1
and the comparison between patients 1 and 2 (ﬁgs 1A and
2A). From the developmental point of view, the two
patients are comparable since they are approximately the
same age, the parents’ educational levels are similar, and

they followed the same therapeutic programme with the
same person. Patient 1 shows a CdCS phenotype with the
cat-like cry, dysmorphism, and developmental and speech
delay. However, her phenotype is very mild in relation to
the deletion breakpoint in 5p14.1 (D5S711), especially
when compared with the results obtained from a wider
study on CdCS (Cerruti Mainardi et al, manuscript in
preparation). The large duplication of 5p12-5p15.2 appar-
ently does not produce any signiﬁcant phenotypic eVect.
This is contrast to patients with duplication of 5p. Patient
2 shows a severe CdCS phenotype in relation to the dele-
tion breakpoint in 5p14.3 (D5S28). Some clinical features
and malformations are attributable to partial trisomy 5p
and others are common both to partial monosomy and
partial trisomy 5p (table 1).

The phenotype of patient 1 is milder than patient 2,
although the deletion is bigger. We therefore speculate that
in patient 1, 5p deletion and 5p duplication could
compensate for each other with the duplicated cell line
contributing a double dosage of the critical region in
5p15.2,5 while the cat-like cry4 and the speech delay
regions6 are present in single dose (ﬁg 1B). This compen-
sation is not possible in patient 2, where the region between
5p14.3 and the telomere is deleted in both cell lines (ﬁg
2B). Overall, in both cases the CdCS phenotype prevails.

compared with that with the duplication, at least in periph-

eral blood lymphocytes. This would suggest that the dele-
tion has been favoured during development because
monosomy 5p is less severe than trisomy 5p, as supported
by the fact that monosomy 5p is far more common than
trisomy 5p.

Patient 3, where both cell lines have a deletion (ﬁg 3B),
shows a classical CdCS phenotype (ﬁg 3A) and its severity
could be because of the prevalence of the more deleted cell
line.

We report a frequency of mosaicism in CdCS of 3.75%.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest record of
cases that allows an estimation of frequency from a homo-
geneous pool of data. Mosaicism for structural aberrations
is generally thought to be very uncommon, and the relative
frequencies of the various types of structural aberrations,
including deletions, have not been established. Data avail-
able on chromosomal structural rearrangements report a
frequency of mosaicism varying from 0.008% in a postna-
tal study to 0.09% in a prenatal study.21 22 Hence, the
frequency of mosaicism in CdCS appears to be very high if
compared with other chromosomal rearrangements. Many
hypotheses could explain this observation. The real
frequency of mosaicism in chromosomal structural rear-
rangements could be understimated either because of the
small number of metaphases analysed or because most
studies were performed using only cytogenetic analysis and
some subtle rearrangements could have been missed. For
instance, in patient 2 the duplicated chromosome 5 was
clearly distinguishable only by the use of molecular cyotge-
netics with locus speciﬁc probes. The instability of the
short arm of chromosome 5 could be attributable to the
unusual richness of low or medium copy number repetitive
sequences, such as LINE-1 elements, chromosome 5 spe-
ciﬁc repeats, or expressed pseudogenes,23–25 causing aber-
rant recombination and rearrangements within the region.
There is increasing evidence that chromosome rearrange-
ments resulting from unequal crossing overs between
homologues, unequal sister chromatid exchanges, meiotic

recombination within a single chromatid, and excision of
intrachromatid loops may result from the presence of
repeated sequences in the human genome.26–28

The absence of a normal cell line in all three cases pre-
sented here is consistent with a prezygotic origin of
inverted tandem duplication. DiVerent mechanisms have
been
such
duplications.29–35 In these cases, the explanation is compli-
cated by the presence of mosaicism and by the absence of
preferential breakpoints. We could postulate that, in all
cases, the ﬁrst common event is the formation of a dicen-
tric chromosome by recombination between mispaired
copies of repeated and inversely oriented sequences at
meiosis I; then, at anaphase I, a breakage of the resulting
dicentric isochromosome would cause, respectively, the inv
dup(5p) in patients 1 and 2 and a del(5p) in patient 3.
Mosaicism could then arise mitotically at the level of a sin-
gle DNA strand where loop formation and unequal cross-
ing over between repeated sequences could cause breakage
of the strand at diVerent points and generate the deleted
cell line in patients 1 and 2 and the line with a bigger dele-
tion in patient 3.

In conclusion, these patients represent the ﬁrst three
cases of de novo 5p anomalies involving two rearranged cell
lines, and provide new insights into mosaic structural rear-
rangements and into genotype-phenotype correlations in
CdCS.

Abnormal sex diVerentiation and
multiple congenital abnormalities in a
subject harbouring an apparently
balanced (6;8) translocation

EDITOR—In XY subjects, the testes are inﬂuenced by the
activity of the sex determining region Y (SRY) gene and its
abnormal function usually results in various degrees of sex
reversal.1 However, as suggested by several authors,2–5
abnormal sexual development may also be caused by errors
in genes located on either the X chromosome (the dosage
sensitive sex reversal locus (DSS) at Xp21.3) or autosomes.
A few reports also describe abnormal sex development in
male patients presenting with 6q chromosome rearrange-
ments,6 7 but a more precise localisation at this level of a
gene involved in sex determination has not been done.

The present

report describes a 46,XY subject of
Algerian origin, presenting with complete gonadal failure,
abnormal external genitalia, and multiple congenital
abnormalities. At birth, bilateral undescended testes, glan-
dular hypospadias, and hypoplastic penis were noted.
However, owing to sociocultural conditions, no investiga-
tions were performed until the age of 34 years, when he was
assessed for infertility and learning disability. His pheno-
type included several dysmorphic features: squint, full lips,
broad nasal root, large and low set ears, mildly short neck,
gynaecomastia, widely spaced nipples, dorsal and lumbar
scoliosis, and gynaecoid morphology. The external genita-
lia were hypoplastic and no gonads were found in the scro-
tum. However, the patient presented with post-androgen
therapy virilisation, including sparse pubic and facial hair.
X ray examination of the skeleton showed L5-S1 vertebral
fusion and bilateral lysis of the vertebral isthmus, increased
lumbar vertebral canal, and bilateral 4-5 brachymetacar-
pus. Ophthalmological examination showed considerable

J Med Genet 2000;37:972–974

reduction in visual acuity (6/10 on the right side and 3/10
on the left side), amblyopia, divergent strabismus, and
visual ﬁeld loss with right central scotoma. Abdominal
ultrasound examination failed to identify any structure that
might be interpreted as a gonad. Endocrinological investi-
gation showed complete absence of testicular function:
plasma testosterone was 0.57 ng/ml (normal 3.4-9 ng/ml)
with no response to HCG stimulation, plasma FSH was
67.5 mIU/ml (normal 1-5 mIU/ml) and plasma LH was 19
mIU/ml (normal 0.8-4 mIU/ml). After administration of

2A, B, and C). No microdeletion or microduplication could
be identiﬁed at either breakpoint level. A count of 20 QFQ
banded metaphases showed a normally ﬂuorescent Y chro-
mosome. The parents, of Algerian origin, were not available
for investigation. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
performed using chromosome 6 and 8 paints (ONCOR)
conﬁrmed the balanced translocation (data not shown). To
position the distal breakpoint at 6q27 more closely, a FISH
technique was performed, using a TATA binding factor gene
speciﬁc probe (ONCOR) that gave a signal close to the
breakpoint on the derivative chromosome 8 (ﬁg 2D).

Southern blot and SSCP analysis of the SRY gene in the
subject were found to be identical to that of a normal male
and hybridisation with the DXS319 probe, which maps to
the distal portion of the DSS locus at Xp21.3, indicated
that he carried a single copy of this region (data not
shown). Therefore, abnormalities of either of these loci
could be excluded as a cause of the patient’s phenotype.

To date, a few reports have described abnormal sex
development in 46,XY males with partial deletion of termi-
nal 6q. In 1975, Milosevic and Kalicanin8 reported a 46,XY
subject presenting with growth and mental retardation,
microcephaly, dysmorphism including hypertelorism, a
broad nasal root, malformed ears, micrognathia, multicystic
kidney, bone abnormalities, and bilateral cryptorchidism.
The patient had a de novo chromosomal rearrangement
resulting in 6q25-6qter deletion. The same cytogenetic
abnormality with a similar phenotype was reported by
Baroshesky et al.9 Ito et al10 described a male child present-
ing with an 6q21-q27 deletion, mental retardation, and sev-
eral congenital abnormalities including bilateral cryp-
torchidism and thymus atrophy. Two other
reports
described similar patients.11 12 Most of these cases also pre-
sented with abnormalities of the kidney and Turner-like
phenotype (short stature, cervical cystic hygroma, short
neck, and widely spaced nipples). Interestingly, deletions of
the long arm of chromosome 6 proximal to band 6q25 do
not seem to result in either kidney, genital, or Turner-like
anomalies. In our patient, gonadal failure was diagnosed by
ultrasound and endocrinological studies, which also ex-
cluded pituitary gonadotrophin deﬁciency, anomalies of the
androgen receptor, or a block in testosterone synthesis. In
1987, Fonatsch et al13 assigned the TCP1 locus to band
6q25-q27. This gene is the human homologue of the mouse
Tcp-1 locus, which is part of the mouse t complex and codes
for a protein abundantly expressed in testicular germ cells.
Another testis expressed gene, TCP10, which is genetically
linked to the oestrogen receptor locus, has been assigned to
the same region.14 Experimental knock-out mice for the
Tcp-1 and Tcp-10 loci show abnormal testis development
and are sterile. In our patient, the 6q breakpoint was shown
to be located at 6q27, proximal to the TATA binding factor
gene. The human homologue (T) of the mouse T (Brachy-
ury) gene has also been located in this region.15 In
vertebrates, the protein product of the T gene is a transcrip-
tion factor crucial
the normal
mesoderm. T mutant Brachyury mice die in mid gestation
with severe defects in posterior mesoderm tissues. Hetero-
zygous mice are viable but have posterior axial malforma-
tions. T protein has been shown to be associated with the
mouse t haplotype, a variant form of the t complex charac-
terised by transmission ratio distortion, male sterility, and
recombination suppression. In humans, the T protein is
involved in susceptibility to spina biﬁda, a multifactorial

LHRH (0.1 mg/m2) FSH rose to 194 mIU/ml and LH to

oestradiol, prolactin, cortisol, ACTH, TSH, DHT, 17-OH-
progesterone, and D-4-androstenedione, were within the
normal range. Calcium binding protein and alkaline phos-
phatase were also normal.

Laparoscopy was performed and a gonad-like structure
was identiﬁed and removed from the left inguinal canal.
However, no such structure was found on the right side.
The patient had a post-appendectomy scar in the right
lower abdominal quadrant, suggesting that the gonad
might have been removed during the surgical procedure.

neural tube defect. Morrison et al16 showed that the human
T gene maps to 6q27 and lies between the two other genes
of the T complex, TCP1 and TCP10.

The present report suggests that male sex determination
and diVerentiation is a complex process, involving several
autosomal loci, and at least one of them is possibly located
at 6q27.

Distal trisomy 2p and arachnodactyly

J Med Genet 2000;37:974–976

His face is long and triangular with semilunar palpebral
ﬁssures (length 2.8 cm). There is a bulbous tip to the nose
with a high bridge. The palate is high and arched.

EDITOR—We report two sibs with an unbalanced transloca-
tion of chromosomes 2 and 10 resulting in distal 2p
trisomy. We feel that this sib pair could help to delineate the
common features that may result from duplication of this
speciﬁc region, in particular to show that arachnodactyly is
a key feature. We suggest that the combination of arachno-
dactyly with developmental delay should prompt investiga-
tion of this region within the diVerential diagnosis.

This sib pair was ﬁrst seen in 1995 aged 8 years (male)
and 11 years (female). They were referred with a combina-
tion of speech and language delay, poor coordination, and
concordant dysmorphic features.

The male sib (ﬁg 1) was born at 38 weeks’ gestation
weighing 3200 g (25th centile). He was noted to have gross
motor delay with hypotonia and walked at 22 months.
Speech development was severely delayed necessitating
Makaton from the age of 2 years. He attended a school for
moderate learning diYculties and required intensive
speech therapy. His motor development is still delayed and
at the age of 11, he cannot ride a bicycle, catch a ball, or
fasten shoe laces. He continues to require considerable
supplemental educational input and speech therapy.

His height has followed the 90th centile with weight
between the 25th and 50th centile and head circumference
on the 50th. There is no limb or body segment dispropor-
tion. Joint ﬂexibility is normal. He has arachnodactyly
(palm length 10.5 cm (75th centile), middle ﬁnger length
8.0 cm (97th centile), middle ﬁnger to total hand ratio
43%) with ﬁfth ﬁnger clinodactyly and prominent ﬁnger
pads. His feet (ﬁg 2) are narrow with metatarsus varus,
medial deviation of the second toe, and a wide sandal gap.

Figure 2 Feet of male child on left aged 8 years, female on right aged 11
years. Their foot abnormalities became more pronounced with increasing age.

Ophthalmological examination showed unilateral myopia
only. Hearing is normal. Echocardiography is normal.

His sister (ﬁg 3) was born at 38 weeks’ gestation weigh-
ing 2940 g (50th centile). She had a splint applied for con-
genital dislocation of the left hip. Her motor skills were at
the extreme of the normal range but she was noted to be
clumsy. She was unable to ride a bicycle until 8 years old.
Speech and language development was delayed requiring
speech therapy. She is educated in a mainstream school
with extra help. Her height follows the 95th centile, head
circumference on the 50th, and her weight is on the 25th.
Upper to lower segment ratio is 0.85, arm span is less than
height, and joint ﬂexibility is normal. Her face is elongated,
the nose is bulbous with a broad bridge, and the palate is
high and arched. Her palpebral ﬁssures are of normal
length (3.1/2.9 cm). She has arachnodactyly with ﬁnger
length on the 97th centile (8.6 cm), palm length 75th cen-
tile (10.5 cm), and middle ﬁnger to total hand ratio 45%.
Her feet (ﬁg 2) are narrow with an exaggerated arch and
there is partial 2/3 syndactyly on the right and overriding
1st/2nd and 4th/5th toes on the left. Ophthalmological
examination, echocardiography, and audiology are normal.
There is one older male sib who is developmentally nor-
mal. His height (aged 17) is 194 cm (>97th centile). In
contrast to his sibs, he is of stocky build. Middle ﬁnger
length is 9.6 cm and palm 11.9 cm. Middle ﬁnger to whole
hand ratio is 44%. His karyotype is unknown. Three other
pregnancies ended in early miscarriage at 12-14 weeks.

Figure 3 Both children displaying concordant dysmorphic features.

Maternal height is 169 cm (75th centile), middle ﬁnger
length 7.2 cm, and palm length 10.5 cm, and the father’s
height is 180 cm (75th centile), middle ﬁnger length 8.8
cm, and palm length 12.3 cm. They are unrelated.

Cytogenetic studies using G banding showed an unbal-
anced translocation 46,XY or 46,XX,−10,+der(10)t(2;10)
(p25.1;q26.3)mat resulting in distal 2p trisomy (2p+).
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies were not
performed as the same translocation in balanced form was
identiﬁed in their mother and maternal grandmother. They
are phenotypically normal. Previous descriptions of 2p+
have included skeletal abnormalities, facial dysmorphism,
severe developmental delay, and cardiac and genital abnor-
malities. These features have been reported with break-

from Wakita et al,4 the breakpoint in this case diVers from
other published cases in that a much shorter duplicated
segment is produced (ﬁg 4). The reciprocal chromosome in
the translocation also varies. In the case described by
Wakita et al,4 trisomy 2p resulted from an isolated duplica-
tion 2p and not a translocation. In this case the 10qter
deletion is very small (on G banding) and probably does
not contribute to the phenotype, although modiﬁcation of
clinical expression by this deletion cannot be excluded.

In these two sibs,

the translocation is

inherited
maternally. In other cases reported, paternal1 and mater-
nal2 transmission as well as de novo4 duplications have been
described with features consistent with distal trisomy 2p,
making the role of imprinting less likely.

To our knowledge correlation of phenotype to dupli-
cated segment length has not been possible. As this sib pair
display some phenotypic diVerences from other cases
described, they may contribute to the understanding of this
correlation. The main phenotypic diVerences are summa-
rised in table 1. In particular, these sibs have neither
cardiac nor genital abnormalities and their development is
mildly to moderately delayed. They do not have growth
failure but have a marfanoid habitus. Arachnodactyly is a
feature of Marfan syndrome which is associated with
mutations in ﬁbrillin genes mapped to chromosomes 5 and
15.5 However, the marfanoid habitus with mental retarda-
tion has also been described in an X linked disorder.6 Mar-
fanoid skeletal and cardiovascular phenotypes have also
been reported which are not linked to known ﬁbrillin
genes.7 The children presented here do not fulﬁl the crite-
ria required for a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.5

A combination of retardation (particularly speech and
language) with arachnodactyly can also occur in 22q11

microdeletion syndrome, but these children have none of
the associated features.8

The presence of arachnodactyly coupled with the
evident arachnodactyly in the short duplication reported
by Wakita et al4 leads us to conclude that this a key feature
of duplications in this region. The inﬂuence of the recipro-
cal chromosome involved in the translocation must be
considered. In other cases described,1–3 9 the reciprocal
chromosome varies yet arachnodactyly is a constant
feature. In this case, the 10qter deletion is unlikely to con-
tribute much to the phenotype (although cannot be
excluded) and the case reported by Wakita et al4 was an
isolated duplication without a translocation, so the features
described can be assumed to result from duplication of this
region alone.

The common features evident in these children com-
bined with the notable absence of others described in dis-
tal
trisomy 2p syndrome aid the phenotype/genotype
correlation in this region. We would be interested in other
reports of duplications which would help this process.

These sibs also show the importance of investigating this
region in children who present with arachnodactyly and
developmental delay of unknown origin; very small dupli-
cations may produce few additional features.
