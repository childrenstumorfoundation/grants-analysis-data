Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common
neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and can profoundly affect the
academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions of children;
the American Academy of Pediatrics ﬁrst published clinical recommen-
dations for the diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000;
recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. Pediatrics 2011;128:
1007–1022

Summary of key action statements:
1. The primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for
any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or
behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or
impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

2. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should
determine that Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, Fourth Edition criteria have been met (including documenta-
tion of impairment in more than 1 major setting); information
should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or guard-
ians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians in-
volved in the child’s care. The primary care clinician should also rule
out any alternative cause (quality of evidence B/strong
recommendation).
In the evaluation of a child for ADHD, the primary care clinician
should include assessment for other conditions that might coexist
with ADHD, including emotional or behavioral (eg, anxiety, depres-
sive, oppositional deﬁant, and conduct disorders), developmental
(eg, learning and language disorders or other neurodevelopmental
disorders), and physical (eg, tics, sleep apnea) conditions (quality of
evidence B/strong recommendation).

3.

4. The primary care clinician should recognize ADHD as a chronic
condition and, therefore, consider children and adolescents
with ADHD as children and youth with special health care needs.
Management of children and youth with special health care
needs should follow the principles of the chronic care model and
the medical home (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

5. Recommendations for treatment of
children and youth with ADHD vary
depending on the patient’s age:
a. For preschool-aged children
(4–5 years of age), the primary
care clinician should prescribe
evidence-based parent- and/or
teacher-administered behavior
therapy as the ﬁrst line of treat-
ment
evidence
A/strong recommendation) and
may prescribe methylphenidate
if the behavior interventions do
not provide signiﬁcant improve-
ment and there is moderate-to-
severe continuing disturbance
in the child’s function. In areas
where evidence-based behav-
ioral treatments are not avail-
able,
the clinician needs to
weigh the risks of starting med-
ication at an early age against
the harm of delaying diagnosis
and treatment (quality of evi-
dence B/recommendation).

b. For elementary

school–aged
children (6–11 years of age), the
primary care clinician should
prescribe US Food and Drug
Administration–approved medica-
tions for ADHD (quality of evi-
dence A/strong recommendation)
and/or evidence-based parent-
and/or
teacher-administered
behavior therapy as treatment
for ADHD, preferably both (qual-
ity of evidence B/strong recom-
mendation). The evidence is par-
ticularly strong for stimulant
medications and sufﬁcient but
less strong for atomoxetine,
extended-release
guanfacine,
and extended-release clonidine
(in that order) (quality of evi-
dence A/strong recommenda-
tion). The school environment,
program, or placement is a part
of any treatment plan.

c. For adolescents (12–18 years of
age), the primary care clinician

should prescribe Food and
Drug Administration–approved
medications for ADHD with the
assent of the adolescent (qual-
ity of evidence A/strong recom-
mendation) and may prescribe
behavior therapy as treatment
for ADHD (quality of evidence
C/recommendation), preferably
both.

6. The primary care clinician should
titrate doses of medication for
ADHD to achieve maximum beneﬁt
with minimum adverse effects
(quality
B/strong
recommendation).

INTRODUCTION
This document updates and replaces 2
previously published clinical guide-
lines from the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) on the diagnosis and
treatment of attention-deﬁcit/hyperac-
tivity disorder (ADHD)
in children:
“Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis
and Evaluation of the Child With Atten-
tion-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder”
(2000)1 and “Clinical Practice Guide-
line: Treatment of
the School-aged
Child With Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactiv-
(2001).2 Since these
ity Disorder”
guidelines were published, new infor-
mation and evidence regarding the di-
agnosis and treatment of ADHD has be-
come available. Surveys conducted
before and after the publication of the
previous guidelines have also provided
insight
into pediatricians’ attitudes
and practices regarding ADHD. On the
basis of an increased understanding
regarding ADHD and the challenges it
raises for children and families and as
a source for clinicians seeking to diag-
nose and treat children, this guideline
pays particular attention to a number
of areas.

Expanded Age Range
The previous guidelines addressed di-
agnosis and treatment of ADHD in chil-

dren 6 through 12 years of age. There
is now emerging evidence to expand
the age range of the recommendations
to include preschool-aged children
and adolescents. This guideline ad-
dresses the diagnosis and treatment
of ADHD in children 4 through 18 years
of age, and attention is brought to spe-
cial circumstances or concerns in par-
ticular age groups when appropriate.

Expanded Scope
Behavioral
interventions might help
families of children with hyperactive/
impulsive behaviors that do not meet
full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Guid-
ance regarding the diagnosis of
problem-level concerns in children
based on the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual for Primary Care (DSM-PC),
Child and Adolescent Version,3 as well
as suggestions for treatment and care
of children and families with problem-
level concerns, are provided here. The
current DSM-PC was published in 1996
and, therefore, is not consistent with
intervening changes to International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM).
Although this version of the DSM-PC
should not be used as a deﬁnitive
source for diagnostic codes related to
ADHD and comorbid conditions, it cer-
tainly may continue to be used as a
resource for enriching the under-
standing of ADHD manifestations. The
DSM-PC will be revised when both the
DSM-V and ICD-10 are available for use.

A Process of Care for Diagnosis
and Treatment
This guideline and process-of-care al-
gorithm (see Supplemental Fig 2 and
Supplemental Appendix) recognizes
evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment
as a continuous process and provides
recommendations for both the guide-
line and the algorithm in this single
publication. In addition to the formal
recommendations for assessment, di-
agnosis, and treatment, this guideline

are beyond the scope of this guideline
but are important to consider.

Integration With the Task Force on
Mental Health
This guideline ﬁts into the broader
mission of the AAP Task Force on
Mental Health and its efforts to pro-
vide a base from which primary care
providers can develop alliances with
families, work to prevent mental
health conditions and identify them
early, and collaborate with mental
health clinicians.
The diagnosis and management of
ADHD in children and youth has been
particularly challenging for primary
care clinicians because of the limited
payment provided for what requires
more time than most of the other con-
ditions they typically address. The pro-
cedures recommended in this guide-
line necessitate spending more time
with patients and families, developing
a system of contacts with school and
other personnel, and providing contin-
uous, coordinated care, all of which is
time demanding. In addition, relegating
mental health conditions exclusively to
mental health clinicians also is not a via-
ble solution for many clinicians, because
in many areas access to mental health
clinicians to whom they can refer pa-
tients is limited. Access in many areas is
also limited to psychologists when fur-
ther assessment of cognitive issues is
required and not available through the
education system because of restric-
tions from third-party payers in paying
for the evaluations on the basis of them
being educational and not health
related.
Cultural differences in the diagnosis and
treatment of ADHD are an important is-
sue, as they are for all pediatric condi-
tions. Because the diagnosis and treat-
ment of ADHD depends to a great extent
on family and teacher perceptions, these
issues might be even more prominent an
issue for ADHD. Speciﬁc cultural issues

METHODOLOGY
As with the 2 previously published clin-
ical guidelines, the AAP collaborated
with several organizations to develop a
working subcommittee that repre-
sented a wide range of primary care
and subspecialty groups. The subcom-
mittee included primary care pediatri-
cians, developmental-behavioral pedi-
atricians, and representatives from
the American Academy of Child and Ad-
olescent Psychiatry, the Child Neurol-
ogy Society, the Society for Pediatric
Psychology, the National Association of
School Psychologists, the Society for
Developmental and Behavioral Pediat-
rics, the American Academy of Family
Physicians, and Children and Adults
With
Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (CHADD), as well as an epide-
miologist from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).
This group met over a 2-year period,
during which it reviewed the changes
in practice that have occurred and is-
sues that have been identiﬁed since
the previous guidelines were pub-
lished. Delay in completing the process
led to further conference calls and ex-
tended the years of literature reviewed
in order to remain as current as pos-
sible. The AAP funded the development
of this guideline; potential ﬁnancial
conﬂicts of the participants were iden-
tiﬁed and taken into consideration in
the deliberations. The guideline will be
reviewed and/or revised in 5 years un-
less new evidence emerges that war-
rants revision sooner.
The subcommittee developed a series
of research questions to direct an ex-
tensive evidence-based review in part-
nership with the CDC and the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center. The diagnostic review was con-
ducted by the CDC, and the evidence
was evaluated in a combined effort of

the AAP, CDC, and University of Okla-
homa Health Sciences Center staff. The
treatment-related evidence relied on a
recent evidence review by the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality
and was supplemented by evidence
identiﬁed through the CDC review.
The diagnostic issues were focused on
5 areas:
1. ADHD prevalence—speciﬁcally: (a)
What percentage of the general US
population aged 21
years or
younger has ADHD? (b) What per-
centage of patients presenting at
pediatricians’ or family physicians’
ofﬁces in the United States meet di-
agnostic criteria for ADHD?

3. What are the functional

ments of children and youth diag-
nosed with ADHD? Speciﬁcally,
in
what domains and to what degree
do youth with ADHD demonstrate
impairments in functional domains,
including peer relations, academic
performance, adaptive skills, and
family functioning?

dard (ie, what are the psychometric
properties of these tests)?

The treatment issues were focused on
3 areas:
1. What new information is available

regarding the long-term efﬁcacy
and safety of medications approved
by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) for the treatment of
ADHD (stimulants and nonstimu-
lants), and speciﬁcally, what infor-
mation is available about
the
efﬁcacy and safety of these medi-
cations in preschool-aged and ado-
lescent patients?

2. What evidence is available about the
long-term efﬁcacy and safety of psy-
chosocial
interventions (behavioral
modiﬁcation) for the treatment of
ADHD for children, and speciﬁcally,
what information is available about
the efﬁcacy and safety of these inter-
ventions in preschool-aged and ado-
lescent patients?

3. Are there any additional therapies
that reach the level of consider-
ation as evidence based?

Evidence-Review Process for
Diagnosis
A multilevel, systematic approach was
taken to identify the literature that
built the evidence base for both diag-
nosis and treatment. To increase the
likelihood that relevant articles were
included in the ﬁnal evidence base, the
reviewers ﬁrst conducted a scoping
review of the literature by systemati-
cally searching literature using rele-
vant key words and then summarized
the primary ﬁndings of articles that
met standard inclusion criteria. The
reviewers then created evidence ta-
bles that were reviewed by content-
area experts who were best able to
identify articles that might have been
missed through the scoping review. Ar-
ticles that were missed were reviewed
carefully to determine where the ab-
straction methodology failed, and ad-
justments to the search strategy were
made as required (see technical re-
port to be published). Finally, although
published literature reviews did not
contribute directly to the evidence

base, the articles included in review
articles were cross-referenced with
the ﬁnal evidence tables to ensure that
all relevant articles were included in
the ﬁnal evidence tables.
For the scoping review, articles were
abstracted in a stratiﬁed fashion from
3 article-retrieval systems that pro-
vided access to articles in the domains
of medicine, psychology, and educa-
tion: PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez), PsycINFO (www.apa.org/
pubs/databases/psycinfo/index.aspx),
and ERIC (www.eric.ed.gov). English-
language, peer-reviewed articles pub-
lished between 1998 and 2009 were
queried in the 3 search engines. Key
words were selected with the intent of
including all possible articles that
might have been relevant to 1 or more
of the questions of interest (see the
technical report to be published). The
primary abstraction included the fol-
lowing terms: “attention deﬁcit hyper-
activity disorder” or “attention deﬁcit
disorder”
and
independent ab-
“child.” A second,
straction was conducted to identify ar-
ticles related to medical screening
tests for ADHD. For this abstraction,
the same search terms were used as
in the previous procedure along with
the additional condition term “behav-
ioral problems” to allow for the inclu-
sion of studies of youth that sought to
diagnose ADHD by using medical
screening tests. Abstractions were
conducted in parallel fashion across
each of the 3 databases; the results
from each abstraction (complete ref-
erence, abstract, and key words) were
exported and compiled into a common
reference database using EndNote
10.0.4 References were subsequently
and systematically deduplicated by us-
ing the software’s deduplication pro-
cedure. References for books, chap-
ters, and theses were also deleted
from the library. Once a deduplicated
library was developed, the semiﬁnal

“hyperkinesis”

or

database of 8267 references was re-
viewed for inclusion on the basis of
inclusion criteria listed in the techni-
cal report.
Included articles were
then pulled in their entirety, the in-
clusion criteria were reconﬁrmed,
and then the study ﬁndings were
summarized in evidence tables. The
articles included in relevant review
articles were revisited to ensure
their inclusion in the ﬁnal evidence
base. The evidence tables were then
presented to the committee for ex-
pert review.

Evidence-Review Process for
Treatment
In addition to this systematic review,
for treatment we used the review from
the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) Effective Health-
care Program “Attention Deﬁcit Hyper-
activity Disorder:
Effectiveness of
in At-Risk Preschoolers;
Treatment
Long-term Effectiveness in All Ages;
and Variability in Prevalence, Diagno-
sis, and Treatment.”5 This review ad-
dressed a number of key questions for
the committee, including the efﬁcacy
of medications and behavioral inter-
ventions for preschoolers, children,
and adolescents. Evidence identiﬁed
through the systematic evidence re-
view for diagnosis was also used as a
secondary data source to supplement
the evidence presented in the AHRQ re-
port. The draft practice guidelines
were developed by consensus of the
committee regarding the evidence. It
was decided to create 2 separate com-
ponents. The guideline recommenda-
tions were based on clear character-
ization of the evidence. The second
component is a practice-of-care algo-
rithm (see Supplemental Fig 2) that
provides considerably more detail
about how to implement the guidelines
but is, necessarily, based less on avail-
able evidence and more on consensus
of the committee members. When data
were lacking, particularly
in the

Practice
Full
the action
statements described in this guideline
and the process-of-care algorithm
might require changes in ofﬁce proce-
dures and/or preparatory efforts to
identify community resources. The
section titled “Preparing the Practice”
in the process-of-care algorithm and
further information can be found in
the supplement to the Task Force on
Mental Health report.7 It is important
to document all aspects of the diagnos-
tic and treatment procedures in the
patients’ records. Use of rating scales
for the diagnosis of ADHD and assess-
ment for comorbid conditions and as a
method for monitoring treatment as
described in the process algorithm
(see Supplemental Fig 2), as well as
information provided to parents such
as management plans, can help facili-
tate a clinician’s accurate documenta-
tion of his or her process.

Note
The AAP acknowledges that some pri-
mary care clinicians might not be
conﬁdent of their ability to success-
fully diagnose and treat ADHD in a
child because of the child’s age, co-
existing conditions, or other con-
cerns. At any point at which a clini-
cian feels that he or she is not
adequately trained or is uncertain
about making a diagnosis or continu-
ing with treatment, a referral to a
pediatric or mental health subspe-
cialist should be made. If a diagnosis
of ADHD or other condition is made
by a subspecialist, the primary care
clinician should develop a manage-
ment strategy with the subspecialist
that ensures that the child will con-
tinue to receive appropriate care
consistent with a medical home
model wherein the pediatrician part-

process-of-care algorithmic portion of
the guidelines, a combination of evi-
dence and expert consensus was used.
Action statements labeled “strong rec-
ommendation” or “recommendation”
were based on high- to moderate-
quality scientiﬁc evidence and a pre-
ponderance of beneﬁt over harm.6
Option-level action statements were
based on lesser-quality or limited
data and expert consensus or high-
quality evidence with a balance be-
tween beneﬁts and harms. These
clinical options are interventions
that a reasonable health care pro-
vider might or might not wish to im-
plement in his or her practice. The
quality of evidence supporting each
recommendation and the strength of
each recommendation were as-
sessed by the committee member
most experienced in epidemiology
and graded according to AAP policy
(Fig 1).6
The guidelines and process-of-care
algorithm underwent extensive peer
review by
sections,
councils, and task forces within the
AAP; numerous outside organiza-
tions; and other individuals identi-
ﬁed by the subcommittee. Liaisons to
the subcommittee also were invited
to distribute the draft to entities
within their organizations. The re-

committees,

sulting comments were compiled
and reviewed by the chairperson,
and relevant changes were incorpo-
rated into the draft, which was then
reviewed by the full committee.

ABOUT THIS GUIDELINE

Key Action Statements
In light of the concerns highlighted
previously and informed by the avail-
able evidence, the AAP has developed
6 action statements for the evalua-
tion, diagnosis, and treatment of
ADHD in children. These action state-
ments provide for consistent and
quality care for children and families
with concerns about or symptoms
that suggest attention disorders or
problems.

Context
This guideline is intended to be inte-
grated with the broader algorithms
developed as part of the mission of
the AAP Task Force on Mental Health.7

Implementation: A Process-of-Care
Algorithm

The AAP recognizes the challenge of
instituting practice changes and
adopting new recommendations for
care. To address the need, a process-
of-care algorithm has been devel-

KEY ACTION STATEMENTS FOR THE
EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS,
TREATMENT, AND MONITORING OF
ADHD IN CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS
Action statement 1: The primary
care clinician should initiate an
evaluation for ADHD for any child 4
through 18 years of age who pres-
ents with academic or behavioral
problems and symptoms of inatten-
tion, hyperactivity, or impulsivity
(quality
B/strong
recommendation).

evidence

of

Evidence Proﬁle
● Aggregate evidence quality: B.
● Beneﬁts: In a considerable number of
children, ADHD goes undiagnosed. Pri-
mary care clinicians’ systematic iden-
tiﬁcation of children with these prob-
lems will likely decrease the rate of
undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in
children.

● Harms/risks/costs: Children in whom
ADHD is
inappropriately diagnosed
might be labeled inappropriately, or an-
other condition might be missed, and
they might receive treatments that will
not beneﬁt them.

● Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The high
prevalence of ADHD and limited mental
health resources require primary care
pediatricians to play a signiﬁcant role in
the care of their patients with ADHD so
that children with this condition receive
the appropriate diagnosis and treat-
ment. Treatments available have shown
good evidence of efﬁcacy, and lack of
treatment results in a risk for impaired
outcomes.

● Value judgments: The committee con-
sidered the requirements for establish-
ing the diagnosis, the prevalence of
ADHD, and the efﬁcacy and adverse ef-
fects of treatment as well as the long-
term outcomes.

● Role of patient preferences: Success
with treatment depends on patient and
family preference, which has to be taken
into account.

● Exclusions: None.
● Intentional vagueness: The limits be-
tween what can be handled by a primary
care clinician and what should be re-
ferred to a subspecialist because of the
varying degrees of skills among primary
care clinicians.

● Strength: strong recommendation.
The basis for this recommendation is
essentially unchanged from that in
the previous guideline. ADHD is the
most common neurobehavioral dis-
order in children and occurs in ap-
proximately 8% of children and
youth8–10; the number of children with
this condition is far greater than can
be managed by the mental health
system. There is now increased evi-
dence that appropriate diagnosis can
be provided for preschool-aged chil-
dren11 (4 –5 years of age) and for
adolescents.12
Action statement 2: To make a diag-
nosis of ADHD, the primary care cli-
nician should determine that Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria have been met
(including documentation of
im-
pairment in more than 1 major set-
ting), and information should be
obtained primarily from reports
from parents or guardians, teach-
ers, and other school and mental
health clinicians involved in the
child’s care. The primary care clini-
cian should also rule out any alter-
native cause (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).

Evidence Proﬁle
● Aggregate evidence quality: B.
● Beneﬁts: The use of DSM-IV criteria has
lead to more uniform categorization of

professional
disciplines.

● Harms/risks/costs: The DSM-IV sys-
tem does not speciﬁcally provide for

● Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The ben-

● Value judgments: The committee took
into consideration the importance of co-
ordination between pediatric and men-
tal health services.

there is some stigma associated with

As with the ﬁndings in the previous
guideline, the DSM-IV criteria con-
tinue to be the criteria best sup-
ported by evidence and consensus.
Developed through several
itera-
tions by the American Psychiatric As-
sociation, the DSM-IV criteria were
created through use of consensus
and an expanding research founda-
tion.13 The DSM-IV system is used by
professionals in psychiatry, psychol-
ogy, health care systems, and pri-
mary care. Use of DSM-IV criteria, in
addition to having the best evidence
to date for criteria for ADHD, also af-
fords the best method for communi-
cation across clinicians and is estab-
lished with third-party payers. The
criteria are under review for the de-
velopment of the DSM-V, but these
changes will not be available until at
least 1 year after the publication of
this current guideline. The diagnos-
tic criteria have not changed since
the previous guideline and are pre-
sented in Supplemental Table 2 . An

Special Circumstances: Preschool-
aged Children (4 –5 Years Old)
There is evidence that the diagnostic
criteria for ADHD can be applied to
preschool-aged children; however, the
subtypes detailed in the DSM-IV might
not be valid for this population.15–21 A
review of the literature, including the
multisite study of the efﬁcacy of meth-
ylphenidate in preschool-aged chil-
dren, revealed that the criteria could
appropriately identify children with
the condition.11 However, there are
added challenges in determining the
presence of key symptoms. Preschool-
aged children are not likely to have a
separate observer if they do not attend
a preschool or child care program,
and even if they do attend, staff in
those programs might be less quali-
ﬁed than certiﬁed teachers to provide
accurate observations. Here, too, fo-
cused checklists can help physicians
in the diagnostic evaluation, although
only the Conners Comprehensive Be-
havior Rating Scales and the ADHD Rat-
ing Scale IV are DSM-IV– based scales
that have been validated in preschool-
aged children.22
When there are concerns about the
availability or quality of nonparent ob-
servations of a child’s behavior, physi-
cians may recommend that parents
complete a parent-training program
before conﬁrming an ADHD diagnosis
for preschool-aged children and con-
sider placement in a qualiﬁed pre-
school program if they have not done
so already.
Information can be ob-
tained from parents and teachers
through the use of validated DSM-IV–
based ADHD rating scales. The parent-
training program must include helping
parents develop age-appropriate de-
velopmental expectations and speciﬁc
management skills for problem behav-
iors. The clinician may obtain reports
from the parenting class instructor
about the parents’ ability to manage
their children, and if the children are

in programs in which they are directly
observed, instructors can report infor-
mation about the core symptoms and
function of the child directly. Qualiﬁed
preschool programs
include pro-
grams such as Head Start or other
public prekindergarten programs.
Preschool-aged children who display
signiﬁcant emotional or behavioral
concerns might also qualify for Early
Childhood Special Education services
through their local school districts,
and the evaluators for these programs
and/or Early Childhood Special Educa-
tion teachers might be excellent re-
porters of core symptoms.

Special Circumstances: Adolescents
Obtaining teacher reports for adoles-
cents might be more challenging, be-
cause many adolescents will have mul-
tiple teachers. Likewise, parents might
have less opportunity to observe their
adolescent’s behaviors than they had
when their children were younger. Ad-
olescents’ reports of their own behav-
iors often differ from those of other
observers, because they tend to mini-
mize their own problematic behav-
iors.23–25 Adolescents are less likely to
exhibit overt hyperactive behavior. De-
spite the difﬁculties, clinicians need to
try to obtain (with agreement from the
adolescent) information from at least
2 teachers as well as information from
other sources such as coaches, school
guidance counselors, or leaders of
community activities in which the ado-
lescent participates. In addition, it is
unusual for adolescents with behav-
ioral/attention problems not to have
been previously given a diagnosis of
ADHD. Therefore, it is important to es-
tablish the younger manifestations of
the condition that were missed and to
strongly consider substance use, de-
pression, and anxiety as alternative or
co-occurring diagnoses. Adolescents
with ADHD, especially when untreated,
are at greater risk of substance
the risks of
abuse.26

In addition,

mood and anxiety disorders and risky
sexual behaviors increase during
adolescence.12

Special Circumstances: Inattention or
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Teachers, parents, and child health
professionals typically encounter chil-
dren with behaviors relating to activity
level, impulsivity, and inattention who
might not fully meet DSM-IV criteria.
The DSM-PC3 provides a guide to the
more common behaviors seen in pedi-
atrics. The manual describes common
variations in behavior as well as more
problematic behaviors at levels of less
impairment than those speciﬁed in the
DSM-IV.
The behavioral descriptions of
the
DSM-PC have not yet been tested in
community studies to determine the
prevalence or severity of developmen-
tal variations and problems in the ar-
eas of inattention, hyperactivity, or im-
pulsivity. They do, however, provide
guidance to clinicians regarding ele-
ments of treatment for children with
problems with mild-to-moderate inat-
tention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.
The DSM-PC also considers environ-
mental inﬂuences on a child’s behavior
and provides information on differen-
tial diagnosis with a developmental
perspective.
Action statement 3: In the evalua-
tion of a child for ADHD, the primary
care clinician should include as-
sessment for other conditions that
might coexist with ADHD, includ-
ing emotional or behavioral (eg,
anxiety, depressive, oppositional
deﬁant, and conduct disorders),
developmental (eg, learning and
language disorders or other neu-
rodevelopmental disorders), and
physical (eg,
tics, sleep apnea)
conditions (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).

A variety of other behavioral, develop-
mental, and physical conditions can
coexist in children who are evaluated
for ADHD. These conditions include,
but are not limited to, learning prob-
lems,
language disorder, disruptive
behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic
disorders, seizures, developmental co-
ordination disorder, or sleep disor-
ders.23,24,27–38 In some cases, the pres-
ence of a coexisting condition will alter
the treatment of ADHD. The primary
care clinician might beneﬁt from addi-
tional support and guidance or might
need to refer a child with ADHD and
coexisting conditions, such as severe
mood or anxiety disorders, to subspe-
cialists for assessment and manage-
ment. The subspecialists could include
child
developmental-
behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelop-
child
mental
neurologists,
school
psychologists.
Given the likelihood that another
condition exists, primary care clini-
cians should conduct assessments
that determine or at least identify
the risk of coexisting conditions.

Health, the AAP has developed algo-
rithms and a toolkit39 for assessing
and treating (or comanaging) the
most common developmental disor-
ders and mental health concerns in
children. These resources might be
useful in assessing children who are
being evaluated for ADHD. Payment
for evaluation and treatment must
cover the ﬁxed and variable costs of
providing the services, as noted in
the AAP policy statement “Scope of
Health Care Beneﬁts for Children
From Birth Through Age 26.40

Special Circumstances: Adolescents
Clinicians should assess adolescent
patients with newly diagnosed ADHD
for symptoms and signs of substance
abuse; when these signs and symp-
toms are found, evaluation and treat-
ment for addiction should precede
treatment for ADHD,
if possible, or
careful treatment for ADHD can begin
if necessary.25
Action statement 4: The primary

As in the previous guideline, this rec-
ommendation is based on the evi-
dence that ADHD continues to cause
symptoms and dysfunction in many
children who have the condition over
long periods of time, even into adult-
hood, and that the treatments avail-
able address symptoms and function
but are usually not curative. Al-
though the chronic illness model has
not been speciﬁcally studied in chil-
dren and youth with ADHD,
it has
been effective for other chronic con-
ditions such as asthma,23 and the
medical home model has been ac-
cepted as the preferred standard of
care.41 The management process is
also helped by encouraging strong
family-school partnerships.42
Longitudinal studies have found that,
frequently, treatments are not sus-
tained despite the fact that long-
term outcomes for children with
ADHD indicate that
they are at
greater risk of signiﬁcant problems
if they discontinue treatment.43 Be-
cause a number of parents of chil-
dren with ADHD also have ADHD, ex-
tra support might be necessary to
help those parents provide medica-
tion on a consistent basis and insti-
tute a consistent behavioral pro-
gram. The medical home and chronic
illness approach is provided in the
process algorithm (Supplemental
Fig 2). An important process in ongo-
ing care is bidirectional communica-
tion with teachers and other school
and mental health clinicians involved
in the child’s care as well as with
parents and patients.

Medication
Similar to the recommendations from
the previous guideline, stimulant med-
ications are highly effective for most
children in reducing core symptoms of
ADHD.44 One selective norepinephrine-
reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine45,46)
and 2 selective ␣2-adrenergic agonists
(extended-release guanfacine47,48 and
extended-release
clonidine49) have
also demonstrated efﬁcacy in re-
ducing
symptoms. Because
norepinephrine-reuptake
inhibitors
and ␣2-adrenergic agonists are newer,
the evidence base that supports
them—although adequate for FDA
approval—is
smaller
than that for stimulants. None of them
have been approved for use in
preschool-aged children. Compared
with stimulant medications that have
an effect size [effect size ⫽ (treatment
mean ⫺ control mean)/control SD] of
approximately 1.0,50 the effects of the
nonstimulants are slightly weaker;
atomoxetine has an effect size of ap-
proximately 0.7, and extended-release
guanfacine and extended-release clo-
nidine also have effect sizes of approx-
imately 0.7.
The accompanying process-of-care al-
gorithm provides a list of the currently
available FDA-approved medications
for ADHD (Supplemental Table 3). Char-
acteristics of each medication are pro-
vided to help guide the clinician’s
choice in prescribing medication.
As was identiﬁed in the previous guide-
line, the most common stimulant ad-
verse effects are appetite loss, abdom-
inal pain, headaches, and sleep
disturbance. The results of the Multi-
modal Therapy of ADHD (MTA) study re-
vealed a more persistent effect of stim-
ulants on decreasing growth velocity
than have most previous studies, par-
ticularly when children were on higher
and more consistently administered
doses. The effects diminished by the
third year of treatment, but no com-

rebound

effects were
pensatory
found.51 However, diminished growth
was in the range of 1 to 2 cm. An un-
common additional signiﬁcant ad-
verse effect of stimulants is the occur-
rence of hallucinations and other
psychotic symptoms.52 Although con-
cerns have been raised about the rare
occurrence of sudden cardiac death
among children using stimulant medi-
cations,53 sudden death in children on
stimulant medication is extremely
rare, and evidence is conﬂicting as to
whether stimulant medications in-
crease the risk of sudden death.54–56 It
is important to expand the history to
include speciﬁc cardiac symptoms,
Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, sud-
den death in the family, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, and long QT syn-
drome. Preschool-aged children might
experience increased mood lability
and dysphoria.57 For the nonstimulant
atomoxetine, the adverse effects in-
clude initial somnolence and gastroin-
testinal tract symptoms, particularly if
the dosage is increased too rapidly; de-
crease in appetite; increase in suicidal
thoughts (less common); and hepatitis

Special Circumstances: Preschool-
aged Children
A number of special circumstances
support the recommendation to initi-

ate ADHD treatment in preschool-aged
children (ages 4 –5 years) with behav-
ioral therapy alone ﬁrst.57 These cir-
cumstances include:
● The multisite study of methylpheni-
date57 was limited to preschool-
aged children who had moderate-
to-severe dysfunction.

● The study also found that many chil-
dren (ages 4 –5 years) experience
improvements in symptoms with
behavior therapy alone, and the
overall evidence for behavior ther-
apy in preschool-aged children is
strong.

● Behavioral programs for children 4
to 5 years of age typically run in the
form of group parent-training pro-
grams and, although not always
compensated by health insurance,
have a lower cost. The process algo-
rithm (see Supplemental pages s15-
16) contains criteria for the clini-
cian to use in assessing the quality
of the behavioral therapy. In addi-
tion, programs such as Head Start
and Children and Adults With Atten-
tion Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder
(CHADD)
(www.chadd.org) might
provide some behavioral supports.
Many young children with ADHD might
still require medication to achieve
maximum improvement, and medica-
tion is not contraindicated for children
4 through 5 years of age. However, only
1 multisite study has carefully as-
sessed medication use in preschool-
aged children. Other considerations in
the recommendation about treating
children 4 to 5 years of age with stim-
ulant medications include:
● The study was limited to preschool-
aged children who had moderate-
to-severe dysfunction.

● Research has found that a number
of young children (4 –5 years of age)
experience improvements in symp-
toms with behavior therapy alone.
● There are concerns about the possi-

dren between the ages of 4 and 5
years.

current

Here, the criteria for enrollment (and,
therefore, medication use) included
measures of severity
that distin-
guished treated children from the
larger group of preschool-aged chil-
dren with ADHD. Thus, before initiating
medications, the physician should as-
sess the severity of the child’s ADHD.
Given
those
preschool-aged children with ADHD
who have moderate-to-severe dysfunc-
tion should be considered for medica-
tion. Criteria for this level of severity,
based on the multisite-study results,57
are (1) symptoms that have persisted
for at least 9 months, (2) dysfunction
that is manifested in both the home
and other settings such as preschool
or child care, and (3) dysfunction that
has not responded adequately to be-
havior therapy. The decision to con-
sider initiating medication at this age
depends in part on the clinician’s as-
sessment of the estimated develop-
mental
impairment, safety risks, or
consequences for school or social par-
ticipation that could ensue if medica-
tions are not initiated. It is often helpful
to consult with a mental health special-
ist who has had speciﬁc experience
with preschool-aged children if possible.
Dextroamphetamine is the only medi-
cation approved by the FDA for use in
children younger than 6 years of age.
This approval, however, was based on
less stringent criteria in force when
the medication was approved rather
than on empirical evidence of its safety
and efﬁcacy in this age group. Most of
the evidence for the safety and efﬁcacy
of treating preschool-aged children
with stimulant medications has been

safe and efﬁcacious

from methylphenidate.57 Methylpheni-
date evidence consists of 1 multisite
study of 165 children and 10 other
smaller single-site studies that
in-
cluded from 11 to 59 children (total of
269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site
studies found signiﬁcant efﬁcacy.
It
must be noted that although there is
moderate evidence that methylpheni-
date is
in
preschool-aged children, its use in this
age group remains off-label. Although
the use of dextroamphetamine is on-
label, the insufﬁcient evidence for its
safety and efﬁcacy in this age group
does not make it possible to recom-
mend at this time.
If children do not experience adequate
symptom improvement with behavior
therapy, medication can be pre-
scribed, as described previously. Evi-
dence suggests that the rate of metab-
olizing stimulant medication is slower
in children 4 through 5 years of age, so
they should be given a lower dose to
start, and the dose can be increased in
smaller increments. Maximum doses
have not been adequately studied.57

Special Circumstances: Adolescents
As noted previously, before beginning
medication treatment for adolescents
with newly diagnosed ADHD, clinicians
should assess these patients for symp-
toms of substance abuse. When sub-
stance use is identiﬁed, assessment
when off
the abusive substances
should precede treatment for ADHD
(see the Task Force on Mental Health
report7). Diversion of ADHD medication
(use for other than its intended med-
ical purposes) is also a special con-
cern among adolescents58; clinicians
should monitor
and
prescription-reﬁll requests for signs
of misuse or diversion of ADHD med-
ication and consider prescribing
medications with no abuse potential,
such as atomoxetine (Strattera [Ely
Lilly Co,
and

Indianapolis,

symptoms

IN])

extended-release guanfacine (Intu-
niv [Shire US Inc, Wayne, PA]) or
extended-release clonidine (Kapvay
[Shionogi
Inc, Florham Park, NJ])
(which are not stimulants) or stimu-
lant medications with less abuse po-
tential, such as lisdexamfetamine
(Vyvanse [Shire US Inc]), dermal
methylphenidate (Daytrana [Noven
Therapeutics, LLC, Miami, FL]), or
(Concerta
OROS methylphenidate
[Janssen Pharmaceuticals,
Inc, Ti-
tusville, NJ]). Because lisdexamfet-
amine is dextroamphetamine, which
contains an additional lysine mole-
cule, it is only activated after inges-
tion, when it is metabolized by eryth-
rocyte cells to dexamphetamine. The
other preparations make extraction
of the stimulant medication more
difﬁcult.
Given the inherent risks of driving by
adolescents with ADHD, special con-
cern should be taken to provide med-
ication coverage for symptom con-
trol while driving. Longer-acting or
late-afternoon, short-acting medica-
tions might be helpful
in this
regard.59

Special Circumstances: Inattention or
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Medication is not appropriate for chil-
dren whose symptoms do not meet
DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of ADHD,
although behavior therapy does not re-
quire a speciﬁc diagnosis, and many of
the efﬁcacy studies have included chil-
dren without speciﬁc mental behav-
ioral disorders.

Behavior Therapy
Behavior therapy represents a broad
set of speciﬁc interventions that have a
common goal of modifying the physical
and social environment to alter or
change behavior. Behavior therapy
usually is implemented by training
parents in speciﬁc techniques that im-
prove their abilities to modify and

or in association with medications
challenging. The long-term positive
effects of behavior therapy have yet
to be determined. Ongoing adher-
ence to a behavior program might be
important; therefore, implementing
a chronic care model for child health
might contribute to the long-term
effects.63
Study results have indicated positive
effects of behavior therapy when com-
bined with medications. Most studies
that compared behavior therapy to
stimulants found a much stronger ef-
fect on ADHD core symptoms from
stimulants than from behavior ther-
apy. The MTA study found that com-
bined treatment
(behavior therapy
and stimulant medication) was not sig-
niﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than treat-
ment with medication alone for the
core symptoms of ADHD after correc-
tion for multiple tests in the primary
analysis.64 However, a secondary anal-
ysis of a combined measure of parent
and teacher ratings of ADHD symp-
toms revealed a signiﬁcant advantage

for the combination with a small effect
size of d ⫽ 0.26.65 However, the same
study also found that the combined
treatment compared with medication
alone did offer greater improvements on
academic and conduct measures when
ADHD coexisted with anxiety and when
children lived in low socioeconomic envi-
ronments.
In addition, parents and
teachers of children who were receiving
combined therapy were signiﬁcantly
more satisﬁed with the treatment plan.
Finally, the combination of medication
management and behavior therapy al-
lowed for the use of lower dosages of
stimulants, which possibly reduced the
risk of adverse effects.66

School Programming and Supports
Behavior therapy programs coordinat-
ing efforts at school as well as home
might enhance the effects. School pro-
grams can provide classroom adapta-
tions, such as preferred seating, mod-
iﬁed work assignments, and test
modiﬁcations (to the location at which
it is administered and time allotted for
taking the test), as well as behavior
plans as part of a 504 Rehabilitation
Act Plan or special education Individu-
alized Education Program (IEP) under
the “other health impairment” desig-
nation as part of the Individuals With

Disability Education Act (IDEA).67 It is
helpful for clinicians to be aware of the
eligibility criteria in their state and
school district to advise families of
their options. Youths documented to
have ADHD can also get permission to
take college-readiness tests in an un-
timed manner by following appropri-
ate documentation guidelines.68
The effect of coexisting conditions on
ADHD treatment is variable. In some
cases, treatment of the ADHD resolves
the coexisting condition. For example,
treatment of ADHD might resolve oppo-
sitional deﬁant disorder or anxiety.68
However, sometimes the co-occurring
condition might require treatment
that is in addition to the treatment for
ADHD. Some coexisting conditions can
be treated in the primary care setting,
but others will require referral and co-
management with a subspecialist.

Action statement 6: Primary care
clinicians should titrate doses of
medication for ADHD to achieve
maximum beneﬁt with minimum ad-
verse effects (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).

Evidence Proﬁle
● Aggregate evidence quality: B.
● Beneﬁts: The optimal dose of medica-
tion is required to reduce core symp-
toms to or as close to the levels of chil-
dren without ADHD.

● Harms/risks/costs: Higher levels of
medication increase the chances of ad-
verse effects.

● Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The im-
portance of adequately treating ADHD out-
weighs the risk of adverse effects.

● Value judgments: The committee mem-
bers included the effects of untreated
ADHD when deciding to make this
recommendation.

● Role of patient preferences: The fam-
ilies’ preferences and comfort need to
be taken into consideration in develop-
ing a titration plan.
● Exclusions: None.

FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

● Intentional vagueness: None.
● Strength: strong recommendation.
The ﬁndings from the MTA study sug-
gested that more than 70% of children
and youth with ADHD respond to one of
the stimulant medications at an opti-
mal dose when a systematic trial is
used.65 Children in the MTA who were
treated in the community with care as
usual from whomever they chose or to
whom they had access received lower
doses of stimulants with less frequent
monitoring and had less optimal re-
sults.65 Because stimulants might pro-
duce positive but suboptimal effects at
a low dose in some children and youth,
titration to maximum doses that con-
trol symptoms without adverse effects
is recommended instead of titration
strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram
basis.
Education of parents is an important
component
in the chronic illness
model to ensure their cooperation in
efforts to reach appropriate titration
(remembering that the parents them-
selves might be challenged signiﬁ-
cantly by ADHD).69,70 The primary care
clinician should alert parents and chil-
dren that changing medication dose
and occasionally changing a medica-
tion might be necessary for optimal
medication management, that the pro-
cess might require a few months to
achieve optimal success, and that
medication efﬁcacy should be system-
atically monitored at regular intervals.
Because stimulant medication effects
are seen immediately, trials of different
doses of stimulants can be accom-
plished in a relatively short time period.
Stimulant medications can be effectively
titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis.65
It is important to note that by the 3-year
follow-up of 14-month MTA interventions
(optimal medications management, opti-
mal behavioral management, the combi-
nation of the 2, or community treat-
ment), all differences among the initial 4

groups were no longer present. After the
initial 14-month intervention, the chil-
dren no longer received the careful
monthly monitoring provided by the
study and went back to receiving care
from their community providers. Their
medications and doses varied, and a
number of them were no longer taking
medication. In children still on medica-
tion, the growth deceleration was only
seen for the ﬁrst 2 years and was in the
range of 1 to 2 cm.

CONCLUSION
Evidence continues to be fairly clear
with regard to the legitimacy of the
diagnosis of ADHD and the appro-
priate diagnostic criteria and proce-
dures required to establish a diagno-
sis,
identify co-occurring conditions,
and treat effectively with both behav-
ioral and pharmacologic interven-
tions. However, the steps required to
sustain appropriate treatments and
achieve successful
long-term out-
comes still remain a challenge. To pro-
vide more detailed information about
how the recommendations of
this
guideline can be accomplished, a more
detailed but less strongly evidence-
based algorithm is provided as a com-
panion article.

AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Some speciﬁc research topics perti-
nent to the diagnosis and treatment of
ADHD or developmental variations or
problems in children and adolescents
in primary care to be explored include:
● identiﬁcation or development of
reliable instruments suitable to
use in primary care to assess the
nature or degree of functional im-
pairment in children/adolescents
with ADHD and monitor improve-
ment over time;

● study of medications and other
therapies used clinically but not ap-
proved by the FDA for ADHD, such as

biofeedback;

● determination of the optimal schedule
for monitoring children/adolescents
with ADHD, including factors for adjust-
ing that schedule according to age,
symptom severity,
and progress
reports;

● evaluation of the effectiveness of
various school-based interventions;
● comparisons of medication use and
effectiveness in different ages, in-
cluding both harms and beneﬁts;

● development of methods to involve
parents and children/adolescents
in their own care and improve ad-
herence to both behavior and medi-
cation treatments;

● standardized and documented tools
that will help primary care providers in
identifying coexisting conditions;

● development and determination of ef-
fective electronic and Web-based sys-
tems to help gather information to diag-
nose and monitor children with ADHD;
● improved systems of communica-
tion with schools and mental health
professionals, as well as other com-
munity agencies, to provide effec-
tive collaborative care;

● evidence for optimal monitoring by
