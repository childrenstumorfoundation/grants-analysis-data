Abstract

Meningiomas constitute about 34% of primary intracranial tumors and are associated with increased mortality
in patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2). To evaluate potential medical therapies for these tumors, we
have established a quantiﬁable orthotopic model for NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas. We showed that telomerase-
immortalized Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells harbored a single nucleotide deletion in NF2 exon 7 and did
not express the NF2 protein, merlin. We also showed that AR-42, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibited
proliferation of both Ben-Men-1 and normal meningeal cells by increasing expression of p16INK4A, p21CIP1/WAF1,
and p27KIP1. In addition, AR-42 increased proapoptotic Bim expression and decreased anti-apoptotic BclXL levels.
However, AR-42 predominantly arrested Ben-Men-1 cells at G2–M whereas it induced cell-cycle arrest at G1 in
meningeal cells. Consistently, AR-42 substantially decreased the levels of cyclin D1, E, and A, and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen in meningeal cells while signiﬁcantly reducing the expression of cyclin B, important for
progression through G2, in Ben-Men-1 cells. In addition, AR-42 decreased Aurora A and B expression. To
compare the in vivo efﬁcacies of AR-42 and AR-12, a PDK1 inhibitor, we generated and used luciferase-expressing
Ben-Men-1-LucB cells to establish intracranial xenografts that grew over time. While AR-12 treatment moderately
slowed tumor growth, AR-42 caused regression of Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors. Importantly, AR-42–treated tumors
showed minimal regrowth when xenograft-bearing mice were switched to normal diet. Together, these results
suggest that AR-42 is a potential therapy for meningiomas. The differential effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle
progression of normal meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for why AR-42 is well-tolerated
while it potently inhibits tumor growth. Cancer Res; 73(2); 792–803. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

Meningiomas are tumors originating from the meningothe-
lial cells of the arachnoid layer lining the brain and can occur at
the convexity, the skull base, and along the spine (1). About 80%
of meningiomas are benign (WHO grade I), whereas the
remaining are atypical (grade II) and anaplastic (grade III).

These tumors cause signiﬁcant morbidity, including cranial
nerve palsy, seizures, and brainstem compression, which may
lead to paralysis, aspiration pneumonia, and death. Surgical
resection and radiation are current treatment options; how-
ever, complete resection of tumors is often difﬁcult, especially
for those located along the skull base. Approximately 20% of
benign meningiomas recur over 10 years, whereas grade II and
grade III tumors possess greater rates of recurrence. Menin-
giomas can occur sporadically or in patients with neuroﬁbro-
matosis type 2 (NF2), a genetic disorder characterized by the
development of multiple nervous system tumors, including
meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas (2). Meningiomas
in patients with NF2 are associated with disease severity and
increased risk of mortality. Patients with NF2 often have
multiple tumors, and their treatment is challenging. Conse-
quently, the development of novel and effective medical ther-
apeutics to treat meningiomas is urgently needed.

NF2 is caused by mutations in the Neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2)
gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein merlin (3,
4). Most NF2-associated meningiomas and about 50% to 60% of
sporadic meningiomas contain NF2 mutations (2). The obser-
vation that NF2 mutations are present in both benign and
malignant meningiomas suggests that NF2 inactivation may be
an early tumorigenic event and that loss of merlin disrupts

important signaling pathways, ultimately leading to tumori-
genesis. Merlin-deﬁcient meningioma cells exhibit speciﬁc
characteristics, such as cytoskeletal and cell contact defects,
altered cell morphology and growth properties, and suscepti-
bility to senescence (5). In addition, Nf2 inactivation in ara-
chnoidal cells or meningeal precursor cells leads to meningi-
oma formation in mice, further corroborating the role of merlin
in tumorigenesis (6, 7). While these mouse models await
further characterization, additional models that closely mimic
the clinical presentation of NF2-deﬁcient benign meningiomas
and facilitate efﬁcient quantitation of
intracranial tumor
growth will enhance therapeutic testing.

Meningioma cell lines are valuable tools to study tumor
biology and potential treatments. Several patient-derived cell
lines, such as IOMM-Lee and KT21-MG1, have been established
from malignant meningiomas, which exhibit complex genetic
changes and aggressive features (8–10). Using IOMM-Lee cells
and primary meningioma cultures, McCutcheon and collea-
gues (11) generated orthotopic xenografts; however, tumor
growth was not monitored over time, and primary meningi-
oma cells did not uniformly produce tumors. Baia and collea-
gues (12) established intracranial xenografts with luciferase-
expressing IOMM-Lee cells and used bioluminescence imag-
ing (BLI) to quantify tumor growth. However, a quantiﬁable
NF2-deﬁcient, benign meningioma model has not been
described. While several benign meningioma cell lines have
been developed using the HPV E6/E7 or SV40 T-antigen (13,
14), transformation by viral oncogenes alters growth signaling
and behavior of these cells. P€uttmann and colleagues (15)
generated a benign meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1, from a
grade I meningioma using telomerase. Ben-Men-1 cells exhibit
characteristics of meningothelial differentiation and lack one
copy of chromosome 22, which harbors the NF2 gene. How-
ever, the status of the second NF2 allele in Ben-Men-1 cells is
not known.

NF2 inactivation in meningiomas and vestibular schwanno-
mas perturbs several signaling pathways, including the AKT
pathway (16–20). Previously, we showed that a small-molecule
inhibitor of the AKT pathway, AR-12 (formerly OSU-03012),
effectively inhibits the growth of NF2-deﬁcient schwannoma
cells (21). We also showed that AR-42 (HDAC-42), a pan-
histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACi), potently inhibits
schwannoma and meningioma cell proliferation (22, 23). In
addition to inhibiting the activities of histone deacetylases,
which are frequently overexpressed in human cancers (24), AR-
42 can also reduce AKT phosphorylation by disrupting the
interaction between HDAC6 and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1),
enabling free PP1 to dephosphorylate AKT (25). However, the
efﬁcacies of these compounds have not been evaluated in an
NF2-deﬁcient, benign meningioma model in vivo. Furthermore,
the effect of AR-42 in normal meningeal cells has not been
examined.

Here, we showed that Ben-Men-1 cells are NF2-deﬁcient.
Using luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1 cells, we established a
quantiﬁable intracranial meningioma model to evaluate AR-42
and AR-12 as potential therapies. Also, we found that AR-42
differentially inhibited cell-cycle progression of normal men-
ingeal and meningioma cells.

AR-42 as a Potential Treatment for NF2-Deﬁcient Meningioma

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and drugs

Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells have been described
(15). Malignant meningioma KT21-MG1 and IOMM-Lee cells
(8, 9) were kindly provided by Dr. Anita Lal, University of
California, San Francisco (San Francisco, CA). HE1-1 is an
adenovirus E1-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line
(unpublished), and HMS-97 is a human malignant schwan-
noma cell line (26). All cell lines and primary human meningeal
cells (ScienCell) were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). AR-42 and AR-12 were
supplied by Arno Therapeutics and formulated into rodent
chow (Research Diets) to deliver about 25 and 100 mg/kg/d,
respectively (21–23). Also, AR-42 was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for in vitro experiments.

Mutational analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from Ben-Men-1 cells using the
PureGene DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen). NF2 exons were ampli-
ﬁed by PCR using Takara ExTaq DNA polymerase and primer
pairs ﬂanking each exon (27). PCR products were puriﬁed using
the Qiagen Gel Extraction kit and sequenced from both 5
- and
0
3
-directions via automated DNA sequencing. The results were
conﬁrmed by sequencing PCR products obtained using PfuUl-
tra High-ﬁdelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene).

Cell proliferation assay and ﬂow cytometry

Cells were plated at 7,500 cells per well in 96-well plates
overnight and treated with various concentrations of AR-42 for
72 hours. Cell proliferation was measured by resazurin assay
(28), and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calcu-
lated (21). For cell-cycle analysis, subconﬂuent cells were
treated with 1 mmol/L AR-42 or DMSO as a control for 2 days.
For mitotic block, nocodazole (100 ng/mL) was added to drug-
treated cells for another 24 hours before harvesting. Following
treatment, ﬂoating and adherent cells were collected, washed,
and ﬁxed in 75% ethanol (29). Fixed cells were incubated with
0.2 mol/L phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 7.8, to extract low-
molecular-weight DNA, stained in propidium iodide (50 mg/
mL) and RNase A (100 mg/mL), and analyzed using a Calibur
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson; ref. 29).
Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software (TreeStar).

Western blot

Subconﬂuent cells were treated with the indicated concen-
trations of AR-42 for 1 or 2 days. Treated cells were harvested
and lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
Equal amount of protein (20 mg) in each lysate was run on an
SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analysis was con-
ducted as described previously (21).

Lentiviral transduction

Ben-Men-1 cells were transduced with Lenti-CMV-Luc len-
tiviruses (Qiagen) in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide

(8 mg/mL) at 37
C overnight. Transduced cells were passaged
at 1:5 dilution and then selected for puromycin resistance.
Luciferase activity was detected using the Luciferase Reporter

Assay System (Promega; ref. 30), and the clone with the highest
activity, designated Ben-Men-1-LucB (data not shown), was
used subsequently.

Establishment of a skull-base meningioma model

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Nationwide Children's Hospital approved this animal study.
Ben-Men-1-LucB cells were harvested, washed, and resus-
pended in PBS (0.5  106 to 1  106 cells/mouse in 3 mL). Six-
to 8-week-old SCID C.B17 mice were anesthetized with 5%
isoﬂurane (Baxter), and their heads were stabilized in a Kopf
Small-Animal Stereotaxic Instrument. A midline sagittal inci-
sion was made on the cranial skin, and a burr hole was drilled in
the skull 1.5 mm anterior and 1.5 mm to the right of the bregma.
A 26-gauge needle attached to a 10-mL Hamilton syringe loaded
with cells was slowly inserted through the burr hole and
downward about 5 mm to the skull base. The cell suspension
was injected at a rate of 1.5 mL/min via an automatic micro-
injection unit, and the needle was left in place for 1 minute
before being withdrawn slowly. The incision was closed using 3
M VetBond Tissue Adhesive. After recovery, mice were mon-
itored for tumor growth and any neurologic deﬁcits.

BLI and small-animal MRI

To verify tumor establishment, mice stereotactically inoc-
ulated with Ben-Men-1-LucB cells were imaged using a Xeno-
gen IVIS Spectrum (Caliper) 2 and 4 weeks after injection.
Brieﬂy, mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin
(150 mg/kg body weight; Caliper) and anesthetized with iso-
ﬂurane. Kinetic analysis of luciferase activity was conducted to
identify the time at which the peak luminescent signal was
emitted. All subsequent BLI was conducted at this peak time.
Once tumors had established, mice were divided into 3 groups
and fed normal diet, AR-42–formulated diet, or AR-12–con-
taining diet ad libitum. Tumor growth was monitored monthly
by BLI. Photon emission was quantiﬁed by region of interest
analysis using Living Image software (Caliper). Because of
variation in initial tumor size, the luminescence for each
mouse was normalized to the signal measured before treat-
ment and expressed as the mean normalized luminescence 
SD for each treatment group (n ¼ 5 per group). Also, photon
emission from a representative group of mice measured
together for each indicated time point was displayed as total
ﬂux. A cohort of mice treated with AR-42 for 6 months were
switched to normal diet for an additional 6 months and imaged
monthly to assess the extent of tumor regrowth.

For MRI, mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane, injected
intraperitoneally with Magnevist contrast agent (0.1 mmol/L/
kg), and scanned using a BioSpec 94/30 USR 9.4 T microMRI
(Bruker). Tumor volumes were calculated from T1 images as
described previously (22, 26).

Immunohistochemistry

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuri-
dine (BrdUrd; 0.5 mg per 10 g body weight) 2 hours before
euthanasia. Heads were dissected and ﬁxed in 10% phosphate-
buffered formalin. Following washing in running water for 2
hours, heads were treated with 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.2

overnight and decalciﬁed in 0.35 mol/L EDTA in 0.1 mol/L Tris-
HCl, pH 6.95 for 10 to 14 days. After optimal decalciﬁcation (31),
samples were cut in half, incubated in 10% sucrose in 0.1 mol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 overnight, and embedded in parafﬁn. Sections
(5 mm) were obtained, deparafﬁnized, and stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, deparafﬁnized sec-
tions were heated in 1 mmol/L citric acid, pH 6.0, in a steamer
for 20 minutes and sequentially treated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide, Super Block, and a primary antibody overnight
(Supplementary Methods),
followed by incubation with a
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody
and color development with AEC chromogen (ScyTek). Hema-
toxylin was used as a counterstain. Stained sections were
mounted and visualized under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope.
Negative controls were treated with the same procedure but
without the primary antibody.

Results
Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells are NF2-deﬁcient
As Ben-Men-1 cells lack one copy of chromosome 22, which
contains the NF2 gene (15), we determined the status of the
remaining NF2 allele by scanning the 17 NF2 exons for muta-
tions. We detected a deletion of a cytosine (nucleotide #640 rel-
ative to the major transcription initiation site designated as þ1;
ref. 30) in exon 7 in Ben-Men-1 cells, resulting in a premature
stop codon 5 amino acids downstream of the mutation (Fig. 1A).

Figure 1. Ben-Men-1 cells contain a mutation in the NF2 gene and do not
express merlin. A, Ben-Men-1 cells carry a deletion of a cytosine residue
(del640C; marked with an inverted triangle) in NF2 exon 7, resulting in
premature termination. The 17 NF2 exons were obtained from Ben-
Men-1 and control DNA by PCR and sequenced according to Materials
and Methods. B, Western blot analysis showed that Ben-Men-1 benign
meningioma cells and KT21-MG1 malignant meningioma cells did not
express merlin protein, in contrast to normal meningeal cells, IOMM-Lee
malignant meningioma cells, HE1-1 embryonic kidney cells, and HMS-97
malignant schwannoma cells. a-Tubulin was used as a loading control.

Western blot analysis revealed that Ben-Men-1 cells did not
express merlin protein, in contrast to meningeal cells, IOMM-Lee
malignant meningioma cells, and HMS-97 malignant schwan-
noma cells (Fig. 1B). While the frameshift mutation predicts a
truncated product of 218 amino acids, a protein of this size was
not detected in Ben-Men-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
addition, we did not detect merlin protein in KT21-MG1 malig-
nant meningioma cells. These results indicate that Ben-Men-1
and KT21-MG1 cells are NF2-deﬁcient.

AR-42 differentially affects cell-cycle progression of
normal meningeal and Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells

Previously, we showed that AR-42 decreased Ben-Men-1
cell growth with an IC50 of about 1 mmol/L (22). Intriguingly,
AR-42 also inhibited proliferation of meningeal cells at a
similar IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with its
action as an HDACi (32), AR-42 treatment increased global
acetylation of intracellular proteins, including histone H2B,
in both meningeal and Ben-Men-1 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3B). Also, AR-42 decreased expression of p-AKT
and 2 downstream targets of the AKT/mTOR pathway, p-S6
ribosomal protein and p-4E-BP1, in both cell types. These
results indicate that AR-42 exerts similar effects on protein
acetylation and the AKT pathway in meningeal and menin-
gioma cells.

To compare the effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle progression, we
conducted ﬂow cytometric analysis on meningeal and Ben-
Men-1 cells treated with 1 mmol/L AR-42 for 2 days. Consistent
with our previous observation (22), AR-42 treatment substan-

AR-42 as a Potential Treatment for NF2-Deﬁcient Meningioma

tially increased the number of Ben-Men-1 cells in G2–M from
13.1% to 38.8% (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, AR-42 did not affect the
percentage of meningeal cells in G2–M but increased the G1
population from 87.5% to 90%, suggesting G1 arrest. To
enhance detection of cells arrested in G1, nocodazole, an agent
that disrupts microtubule polymerization, was added to AR-42-
treated cells for another day (from 48 to 72 hours) to block cells
in M phase. Note that the doubling time for Ben-Men-1 cells is
about 2 days (15), and meningeal cells double about every 3
days (Supplementary Fig. S4). Addition of nocodazole to AR-
42–treated meningeal cells signiﬁcantly increased the G1 pop-
ulation compared with the nocodazole/DMSO-treated control
(from 83.1% to 89.1%; Fig. 2), conﬁrming that AR-42 induced G1
arrest in meningeal cells. As expected, nocodazole substantially
increased the percentage of DMSO-treated Ben-Men-1 cells in
G2–M from 13.1% to 61.1% while decreasing the G1 fraction
from 72.6% to 18.2%. However, addition of nocodazole to AR-
42–treated Ben-Men-1 cells only slightly increased the G2–M
population compared with AR-42–treated cells in the absence
of nocodazole (from 38.8% to 40.2%), suggesting that AR-42 also
impeded G1 progression of Ben-Men-1 cells. Collectively, these
results showed that AR-42 inhibited cell-cycle progression of
Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells in both G2–M and G1, whereas it
arrested meningeal cells in G1.

AR-42 modulates the expression of cell-cycle regulators
To investigate the mechanism by which AR-42 differentially
induces cell-cycle arrest in meningeal and Ben-Men-1 cells, we
analyzed the expression of various cyclin-dependent kinase

Figure 2. Differential effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle progression of normal meningeal and Ben-Men-1-LucB cells. Meningeal and Ben-Men-1-LucB cells were
treated with 1 mmol/L AR-42 or DMSO for 2 days. To block cells in mitosis, nocodazole (NOC) was added to AR-42–treated cells for another day. After ﬁxation,
cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. AR-42 treatment increased the fraction of Ben-Men-1 cells in G2–M, while
increasing the number of meningeal cells in the G1 population. Addition of nocodazole further increased the percentage of meningeal cells in G1.

Figure 3. The effects of AR-42 on
the expression of various cell-cycle
and apoptotic regulators. Western
blot analysis showed that the levels
of p16INK4A, p21CIP1/WAF1, and
p27KIP1 increased in meningeal
and Ben-Men-1 cells treated with
AR-42 for 24 hours (A). While AR-42
attenuated the expression of cyclin
D1, cyclin E, cyclin B, and CDC2, a
marked reduction in the cyclin A
and PCNA levels was observed in
meningeal cells (B). However, AR-
42 only modestly decreased PCNA
expression but signiﬁcantly
reduced the cyclin B level in Ben-
Men-1 cells. AR-42 decreased the
levels of Aurora A and Aurora B,
whereas Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1
expression were unaffected (C).
AR-42 increased the expression of
Bim isoforms (BimEL, BimL, and
BimS) and Bag1 isoforms (Bag1L
and Bag1M; D), whereas

(CDK) inhibitors and cyclins. Both meningeal and Ben-
Men-1 cells expressed low levels of p16INK4A, p21CIP1/WAF1, and
p27KIP1. Treatment with AR-42 induced the expression of
these CDK inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner in both
cell types (Fig. 3A). However, AR-42 did not affect p57KIP2
expression. These results show that inhibition of cell-cycle
progression by AR-42 in meningeal and Ben-Men-1 cells is
mediated, in part, by induction of multiple CDK inhibitors.

Mitogen stimulation induces the expression of cyclin D,
which activates CDK4/6 at early G1, followed by increasing
cyclin E and A levels during late G1. CDK2, which binds to cyclin
E and A, and CDC2, which binds to cyclin E, promote the G1–S

transition. In addition, cyclin B and CDC2 are important for
progression through G2 (33). While Ben-Men-1 cells expressed
higher basal levels of cyclin D1 and E than meningeal cells, AR-
42 treatment attenuated the expression of these cyclins and
markedly decreased the cyclin A level in meningeal cells (Fig.
3B). The decreased expression of these cyclins corroborated
the observation that AR-42 induced G1 arrest in meningeal
cells. Consistently, AR-42 notably reduced the level of prolif-
erating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein induced in S-
phase, and further decreased cyclin B and CDC2 expression in
meningeal cells. Similarly, AR-42 treatment
lowered the
expression of cyclin D1, E, and A in Ben-Men-1 cells, albeit

the decrease was less dramatic. Consistent with G2–M arrest,
AR-42 only modestly decreased PCNA expression but signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the cyclin B level in Ben-Men-1 cells.

Taken together, these results suggest that AR-42 differen-
tially affects cell-cycle progression of normal meningeal and
Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells by regulating the expression of
various cyclins and CDK inhibitors.

AR-42 decreases the expression of Aurora kinases and
modulates the levels of apoptotic factors

We also analyzed the effect of AR-42 on the expression of
various mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint kinases (34). Both
meningeal and Ben-Men-1 cells strongly expressed Bub1 and
Bub3; however, Ben-Men-1 cells exhibited higher levels of
BubR1, Aurora A, and Aurora B than meningeal cells (Fig.
3C). While the Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1 levels were not affected
by AR-42 treatment, Aurora A expression decreased substan-
tially in both meningeal and Ben-Men-1 cells treated with AR-42.
Also, the level of Aurora B decreased in AR-42–treated Ben-Men-
1 cells. The reduced expression of Aurora kinases may further
reinforce the effect of AR-42 on G2–M arrest in Ben-Men-1 cells.
AR-42 induces apoptosis in several types of tumor cells
(22, 32, 35, 36); however, its effects on normal and tumor cells
have not been compared. AR-42 treatment increased the
expression of proapoptotic Bim in a dose-dependent manner
but did not affect the levels of Bad and Bax in both meningeal
and Ben-Men-1 cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, AR-42 increased the
Bag1 level; however, the increase was not as pronounced at
higher concentrations (e.g., 2 mmol/L). Conversely, AR-42
decreased the expression of antiapoptotic BclXL and survivin
in both cell types (Fig. 3E). While Ben-Men-1 cells expressed
higher levels of Bcl2 and survivin than in meningeal cells, the
expression of Bcl2 was not affected by AR-42 treatment. These
results indicate that AR-42 affects the expression of speciﬁc
pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators.

AR-42 and AR-12 inhibited tumor growth in a
quantiﬁable intracranial benign meningioma model

To establish a quantiﬁable model for NF2-deﬁcient benign
meningiomas, we stereotactically injected luciferase-expres-
sing Ben-Men-1-LucB cells, which exhibited a similar sensitiv-
ity to AR-42 as their parental Ben-Men-1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5), to the skull base of SCID mice and monitored tumor
growth by BLI. Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors grew slowly over time
(Fig. 4A). Unlike KT21-MG1 malignant meningioma xeno-
grafts, which invaded the brain tissue (Supplementary Fig.
S6), Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors grew from the site of injection
along the side of the brain (Fig. 4B). As in the original tumor,
which expressed epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin,
markers commonly used for meningiomas (15), we detected
strong staining for vimentin in Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors (Sup-
plementary Fig. S7). These results showed a quantiﬁable,
orthotopic NF2-deﬁcient benign meningioma model in which
tumor growth could be easily monitored.

Using this model, we compared the in vivo efﬁcacies of AR-42
and AR-12. Mice with established Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors
were fed normal diet or diet containing AR-42 or AR-12 for 6
months. BLI showed that the tumors in mice fed normal diet

Figure 4. Ben-Men-1-LucB cells established intracranial xenograft tumors
that grew slowly along the skull over time. A, about 5  105 Ben-Men-1-
LucB cells were stereotactically injected at the skull base, and tumor
growth was monitored by BLI according to Materials and Methods. BLI
detected increased bioluminescent signal in Ben-Men-1-LucB
xenograft–bearing mice with each month after injection. B, hematoxylin
and eosin staining of the head region of a xenograft-bearing mouse 4
months after implantation showed that Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors grew
from the site of injection along the skull to the top of the head region and
did not invade the adjacent brain tissue. B, brain; T, tumor.

grew steadily as shown by an increase in bioluminescence
signal over time (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B). The
tumors in mice fed AR-12 diet also continued to increase in
size; however, the growth was slower than those in mice fed
normal diet by an average of about 54% after 6 months of
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8B). In contrast, the tumors in
mice fed AR-42 regressed, as evident by a sharp decrease in
bioluminescence signal after 1 month, and remained small in
subsequent months (Fig. 5A and 5B). AR-42 treatment reduced
the bioluminescence signal by 82% (avg.) after 1 month and
about 92% after 6 months (Fig. 5B).

MRI conﬁrmed inhibition of tumor growth by AR-42 and AR-
12. While tumors were observed in mice fed normal diet and
AR-12-containing chow, the tumor volumes in AR-12-treated
mice were smaller than those in mice fed normal diet (Fig. 5C;
Supplementary Table S1).
In contrast, tumors were not
detected in mice treated with AR-42 for 4 to 6 months. A small
tumor was found in a mouse treated with AR-42 for a shorter
duration (Supplementary Fig. S9). It should be noted that the
BLI detected a greater attenuation of tumor growth in AR-12–
treated mice (compared with normal diet) than MRI (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Nonetheless, both methods conﬁrmed that
AR-12 attenuated tumor growth.

Collectively, these results indicate that AR-42 causes tumor
regression, whereas AR-12 moderately slows the growth of
tumors over time.

AR-42 as a Potential Treatment for NF2-Deﬁcient Meningioma

Figure 6. AR-42–treated tumors
exhibited minimal regrowth. A Ben-
Men-1-LucB xenograft–bearing
mouse was fed AR-42 diet for 6
months and then switched to normal
diet for an additional 6 months. A, the
bioluminescence signal emitted from
the tumor markedly decreased
following AR-42 treatment and
remained low with minimal regrowth
after removal from AR-42 diet. B,
quantitation of the bioluminescence
intensity conﬁrmed minimal tumor
regrowth in the AR-42–treated
mouse after switching to normal diet
for 6 months.

Minimal regrowth of Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors was
observed after removal from AR-42 treatment

To evaluate potential tumor regrowth following AR-42 treat-
ment, we fed an AR-42–treated mouse normal diet for an
additional 6 months and monitored tumor growth monthly by
BLI. While AR-42 treatment substantially decreased the tumor
size as shown by the marked decrease of bioluminescence signal
after six months (from 7.7  106 to 2.0  105 photons/sec), the
tumor remained small with minimal regrowth (2-fold increase
in bioluminescence signal) over 6 months after removal from
AR-42–containing diet (Fig. 6). Also, the tumor remained too
small to be detected by MRI (Supplementary Fig. S10).

Histologic analysis corroborated that the tumors in mice
treated with AR-12 for 6 months were smaller than those fed
normal diet (Fig. 7A). Also, a very small tumor was found in a
mouse treated with AR-42 for 3 months, consistent with the
MRI result. AR-42–treated tumors exhibited increased levels of
acetylated proteins compared with mice fed normal diet or
diet containing AR-12 (Fig. 7B). As observed in cultured cells
(Fig. 3A), a higher level of p16INK4A was detected in the tumors
of AR-42–treated mice than in those of mice fed normal diet
(Supplementary Fig. S8B). Consistent with the potent growth-
inhibitory activity of AR-42, few or no BrdUrd- or Ki67-positive
cells were seen in AR-42–treated tumors. Together with our
previous observation that AR-42 induces apoptosis in vivo

(22), these results indicate that AR-42 efﬁciently inhibits
tumor growth in the Ben-Men-1-LucB benign meningioma
model.

Discussion

Development of novel therapeutics for meningiomas, par-
ticularly those associated with NF2, is urgently needed and
requires disease-speciﬁc models. In the present study, we
generated a quantiﬁable orthotopic NF2-deﬁcient benign
meningioma model using luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1-
LucB cells. Using this model, we compared the in vivo efﬁcacies
of AR-42, a pan-HDACi (25), and AR-12, a PDK1 inhibitor (37),
and showed that AR-42 causes tumor regression, whereas AR-
12 moderately slows the growth of tumors over time.

Previously, we reported that AR-42 efﬁciently inhibits
schwannoma and meningioma cell proliferation by arresting
cells at G2–M and inducing apoptosis (22). Intriguingly, AR-42
inhibited proliferation of normal meningeal cells at about the
same IC50 as that for Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells. Although
AR-42 exerted similar effects on protein acetylation and AKT
phosphorylation in both normal and tumor cells, it arrested
meningeal cells at G1 but inhibited Ben-Men-1 cells at both G1
and G2–M. Cell-cycle progression is modulated by CDKs, which
are bound and activated by one or more cyclin proteins whose

expression oscillates during speciﬁc phases of the cell cycle
(33). In addition, several regulatory checkpoints exist through-
out the cell cycle to maintain genomic stability. Activation of
the G1 and G2 checkpoints increases the expression of CDK
inhibitors and arrests cells in these phases, providing them
time to repair any damage before continuing the cell cycle (38).
The INK4 family of CDK inhibitors inhibits cyclin D–associated
CDK4/6 at G1, whereas the CIP/KIP family regulates a wider
range of cyclin–CDK complexes throughout the cell cycle.
HDACi have been shown to induce G1 and/or G2–M arrest in
tumor cells, and their action is mediated, in part, by altering the
levels of various CDK inhibitors (39). HDACi can affect tran-
scription of the p16INK4A and p21CIP1/WAF1 genes and alter the
p27KIP1 level by a posttranslational mechanism. Consistently,
AR-42 induced the expression of both the INK (p16INK4A) and
CIP/KIP (p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1) members. However, the
induction of these CDK inhibitors by AR-42 in both meningeal
and Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells implies that additional
mechanisms contribute to the differential effects on cell-cycle
progression in these cells.

Tumor cells frequently exhibit an abnormal G1 checkpoint
as evident by alteration of the G1 cyclin-CDKs/the INK family/
the retinoblastoma protein/E2F cascade (33, 38). Consistent
with this notion, Ben-Men-1 cells expressed higher basal levels

of the G1 cyclins, D1 and E, than meningeal cells. While AR-42
treatment decreased cyclin E and A expression, signiﬁcant
amounts of these cyclins and PCNA were still detected even in
the presence of 2 mmol/L AR-42, suggesting that a fraction of
AR-42–treated meningioma cells enter S-phase. It is possible
that the increased expression of multiple CDK inhibitors,
together with the decreased levels of G1 cyclins, led to the
growth inhibition at G1 observed in AR-42–treated Ben-Men-1
cells. However, the reduction of cyclin B expression by AR-42
may further inhibit the Ben-Men-1 cells that had progressed
through S-phase and arrest them at G2. In contrast, AR-42
treatment blocked the expression of cyclin D1, E, and A in
meningeal cells, and this inhibition, together with the elevated
levels of CDK inhibitors, could explain the G1 arrest observed in
these cells. Consistently, only a small amount of PCNA and little
cyclin B were detected in AR-42–treated meningeal cells.
HDACi can affect cyclin D, E, and B expression through a
transcriptional mechanism or increase acetylation of cyclin A,
which facilitates its degradation (39–42). It will be interesting
to investigate why AR-42 treatment caused a more pronounced
reduction of the cyclin A level in meningeal cells than Ben-Men-
1 cells. Nevertheless, the differential effect of AR-42 on cell-
cycle progression of meningeal and meningioma cells involves
modulation of the expression of multiple cell-cycle regulators.

The mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, which protects
the integrity of cell division, is frequently altered in human
tumors and regulated by several kinases, including Bub1,
Bub3, and BubR1 (34). In addition, Aurora kinases A and B
are important for spindle assembly, chromosome segrega-
tion, and cytokinesis (43). Curiously, Ben-Men-1 cells
expressed higher levels of Aurora A, Aurora B, and BubR1
than meningeal cells, suggesting deregulation of the mitotic
spindle checkpoint in meningioma cells. Importantly, AR-42
decreased the expression of Aurora A and B, further cor-
roborating G2–M arrest in Ben-Men-1 cells. HDACi can
decrease transcription of Aurora A and B or promote their
degradation in different cell types (44–45). However, the
mechanism by which AR-42 reduces the expression of Auro-
ra kinases in meningeal and meningioma cells is not known.
As Aurora A and B are frequently ampliﬁed or overexpressed
in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies (34, 43),
AR-42 may also be a potential therapeutic agent for these
tumors.

The members of the Bcl2 family, which consists of proa-
poptotic and anti-apoptotic factors, interact with each other in
a delicate balance that governs whether a cell will undergo
apoptosis. Our observation that AR-42 increased the expres-
sion of Bim and Bag1 and decreased the level of BclXL coincides
with previous ﬁndings that AR-42 induced apoptosis in tumor
cells (22, 32, 35, 36). Also, HDACi have been shown to induce the
expression of Bcl2 family members, including Bim and BclXL
(35, 36, 46). Together, these results suggest that AR-42–induced
apoptosis is mediated, in part, through modulation of proa-
poptotic and anti-apoptotic factors.

Previously, we (21) showed that AR-12, a derivative of
celecoxib that lacks COX-2 inhibitory activity (37), decreased
AKT phosphorylation and efﬁciently inhibited schwannoma
growth in vitro and in vivo. As in schwannoma xenografts (21),
AR-12 exhibited moderate antitumor activity in Ben-Men-1-
LucB meningiomas. Interestingly, AR-42 gave rise to more
profound growth inhibition than AR-12 and caused tumor
regression, suggesting that inhibition of the AKT pathway is
not sufﬁcient to account for the antitumor potency of AR-42.
Also, the residual tumors in AR-42-treated mice showed min-
imal regrowth after switching to normal diet. As AR-42 also
potently inhibits schwannoma growth and is well tolerated in
mice (22, 23), these results suggest that it is a promising
therapeutic agent for NF2-deﬁcient tumors.

BLI is a sensitive and efﬁcient way to noninvasively monitor
tumor growth, particularly for longitudinal studies of benign
tumors. Using BLI, we detected bioluminescence signal emit-
ted from small luciferase-expressing tumors in AR-42–treated
mice, whereas MRI could not identify tumors in the same
mice. This observation is consistent with a previous report
that MRI efﬁciently identiﬁes macroscopic tumors but is less
effective at detecting small tumors in mice compared with BLI
(47). Also, MRI measured a less pronounced reduction in
tumor size in AR-12–treated mice than BLI. It is possible that
BLI may quantify the differences in cell density in benign
tumors. Treatment may affect peritumoral edema of intra-
cranial meningiomas (48), and ﬂuid surrounding the tumors
may obscure the tumor margin used in volumetric MRI

AR-42 as a Potential Treatment for NF2-Deﬁcient Meningioma

measurement. Nevertheless, MRI and BLI were complemen-
tary tools to quantify the effects of AR-42 and AR-12 on tumor
growth.

Overexpressed or sustained HDAC activity has been
observed in many solid and hematologic malignancies,
suggesting therapeutic potential of HDACi (24, 49). Several
HDACi are currently in clinical trials for various types of
cancer. Among them, Zolinza (vorinostat) and Romidepsin
(depsipeptide) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphomas. AR-42 possesses growth-inhibitory activity that is
comparable to or more potent than vorinostat in several tumor
models (32, 35, 36, 50). It is orally bioavailable, penetrates the
blood–brain barrier, and exhibits low toxicity. Mice treated
with AR-42 showed slight weight loss, leukopenia, anemia,
liver hypertrophy, and testicular degeneration, and these
effects are reversible after removal from treatment (23, 50).
AR-42 is currently being evaluated in a phase I/IIa clinical
trial for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoma. Our observation that
AR-42 differentially affects cell-cycle progression of normal
meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for
why it is well-tolerated while potently inhibiting tumor
growth as prolonged G2 arrest may lead to apoptosis in
proliferating tumor cells. Collectively, our results suggest
that AR-42 merits a clinical trial
for meningiomas and
schwannomas.
