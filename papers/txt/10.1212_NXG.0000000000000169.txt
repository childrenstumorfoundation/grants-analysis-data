Next, we examined the previously published alter-
natively spliced exons: exon 9a contains a 30-
nucleotide sequence encoding 10 amino acids and is
predominantly expressed in postmitotic brain neu-
rons,3 whereas the muscle-specific exon 48a contains
54 nucleotides that encode 18 amino acids at the
the protein.4 The 63-
carboxyl
nucleotide exon 23a encodes 21 amino acids that
are inserted within the RAS-GTPase-activating pro-
tein (GAP)-related domain of the NF1 protein (neu-
rofibromin),
resulting in diminished RAS-GAP
activity.4 The most recently described alternatively
spliced exon, exon 10a-2, contains 45 nucleotides
and encodes 15 amino acids, is located at the amino
terminus of neurofibromin, and this sequence has
been hypothesized to direct intracellular membrane
targeting by virtue of its predicted transmembrane
domain.5 Using published alternatively spliced exon
sequences (figure e-1), BLAST searches were per-
formed, and these alternatively spliced exons were
renumbered and named according to their location
(figure 1)—between exons 11–12 (11alt12; formerly
9a), exons 12–13 (12alt13; formerly 10a-2), exons
30–31 (30alt31; formerly 23a), and exons 56–57
(56alt57; formerly 48a). In this regard, we propose
that the nucleotides (and the encoded amino acids) of
alternatively spliced exons be numbered
these
11alt12_1–30
(1–15),
30alt31_1–63 (1–21), and 56alt57_1–54 (1–18).
Possible new alternatively spliced exons should be
similarly named based on their location.

11alt12 is 100% identical to both the cDNA and
amino acid sequences of the predicted Mus musculus
transcript variant X7 (mRNA XM_006532442.3),

95.2% identical to the amino acid sequence (contain-
ing a single conservative lysine-to-arginine change) of
Mus musculus Nf1 (ENSMUST00000071325.8)

UPDATED NOMENCLATURE FOR HUMAN AND
MOUSE NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1 GENES

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM 162200) is
one of the most common neurogenetic conditions,
affecting 1 in 3,000 people worldwide. Characterized
by a propensity to develop nervous system tumors,
learning and behavioral deficits, and pigmentary
abnormalities, NF1 is caused by a germline sequence
alteration in the NF1 gene (OMIM: 613113; chro-
somatic NF1
mosome 17q11.2).
sequence changes have been reported in numerous
other cancers,1 extending their importance to malig-
nancies occurring in the general population.

In addition,

The NF1 gene, comprising 57 exons, was initially
identified, and its complete coding sequence was assem-
bled over 25 years ago.2 In the ensuing decades, 4 alter-
natively spliced exons (9a, 10a-2, 23a, and 48a) were
discovered and added to a large number of exons with
temporary numerical assignments (e.g., 10a2 or 23.2).
This has led to considerable confusion and inconsisten-
cies in clinical and scientific publications, which also has
critical implications for NF1 DNA sequence alteration
reporting as part of patient management, genotype-
phenotype correlations, and the interpretation of small
animal models
patient-specific
sequence changes. To provide a unified annotation sys-
tem for the NF1 gene, the mouse and human genes
were aligned and assembled using published sequences
for sequential numbering and comparison.

engineered with

The full-length cDNA sequences of NF1 (8457
nucleotides; figure e-1 at Neurology.org/ng) and Nf1
(8463 nucleotides; figure e-2) genes were initially
aligned using Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) (NIH) optimized for mega-
blast, revealing 92% sequence identity with 0.08%
mismatches (figure e-2). Excluding the alternatively
spliced exons, the ubiquitously expressed 57 exons
were consecutively numbered (figure 1 and tables
e1–e3). As such, the full-length human NF1 tran-
script, NF1-002 (ENST00000356175.7), contains
57 exons and encodes 2818 amino acids, while the
corresponding full-length mouse Nf1 transcript, Nf1-
003 (ENSMUST00000108251.8), comprises 57
exons and encodes 2,820 amino acids, with 2 addi-
tional amino acids encoded by exon 17. Alignment of

megablast, discontinuous megablast, or BLASTN
searches (figures e-4 and e-5). Based on the absence of
12alt13 and 56alt57 sequences in the mouse, further
studies will be required to define their roles in neuro-
fibromin function. It should be noted that neither
12alt13 nor 56alt57 has been reported in other reference
model organisms (rat or zebrafish; data not shown).

Taken together, we assembled and updated the
human NF1 and mouse Nf1 sequences to facilitate
greater consistency in both clinical reporting and
basic research studies on NF1. The clarification of
the nomenclature for the NF1 gene is a necessary step
to enable standardization of exon, nucleotide, and
amino acid numbering, which is particularly impor-
tant for reporting patient-specific DNA sequence var-
iants. In addition, implementation of this proposed

numbering system will provide better calibration of
human genetic testing results with Nf1 preclinical
precision medicine models developed using geneti-
cally engineered mice6 and induced pluripotent stem
cells.7
