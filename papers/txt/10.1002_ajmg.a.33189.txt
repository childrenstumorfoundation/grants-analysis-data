Abstract

The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on
neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children’s Tumor Foundation for over 20 years.
The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13th – June 16th, 2009 and co-
chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children’s Hospital at
Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The
Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts
presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous
advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress
toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical
trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to
280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical
researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational
research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research.
These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

Neurofibromatosis (of which there are three main forms, NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis)
affects 1:3,000 individuals, and characteristically causes largely benign but often debilitating
tumors to grow in the nervous system. There are three main forms of NF: NF1, NF2 and
schwannomatosis. NF1 and NF2 are autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in
tumor-suppressor protein encoding genes. NF1 is typically diagnosed in childhood by
appearance of dermal café au lait spots. Its course is unpredictable: it can cause a variety of
benign nerve tumors including plexiform, dermal and optic glioma tumors; in some cases
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can develop from plexiforms. Around two-thirds
of individuals with NF1 develop learning disabilities, and around a quarter may develop
bone abnormalities such as tibial dysplasia [for recent NF1 review, see Boyd et al., 2009;
Williams et al., 2009]. Recently, a milder NF1-like phenotype, termed Legius syndrome,
was characterized, and is associated with café-au-lait spots, learning disabilities and minor
bone abnormalities, but with absence of neural tumors [Brems et al., 2007; Spurlock et al.,
2009]. NF2 is usually diagnosed in young adults by tinnitus or imbalance, and is
characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas growing on the 8th cranial nerves. Those
with NF2 will often lose their hearing due to auditory nerve damage during necessary
surgery to remove these tumors. NF2 can also cause spinal schwannomas and meningiomas
[for recent NF2 review, see Evans, 2009]. Overall the underlying genetics, biology and
signaling pathways of NF1 and NF2 are fairly well understood and clinical trials are now
underway. Schwannomatosis is the least understood form of neurofibromatosis. It is largely
diagnosed in adulthood and characterized by peripheral schwannomas and pain that is very
difficult to manage [MacCollin et al., 2005]. A candidate gene for schwannomatosis was
recently identified [Hulsebos et al. 2007], and though not yet fully understood, efforts are
well underway to better understand the genetics and clinical diagnosis of schwannomatosis
as well to develop research tools such as mouse models for cellular and molecular studies.

All of these topics were addressed at the 2009 NF Conference: New Frontiers, and the
highlights summarized here provide a snapshot of the current state of the neurofibromatosis
research and clinical arena.

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF NF CLINICAL TRIALS?

Roger Packer (Children’s National Medical Center) and Jaishri Blakeley (Johns Hopkins
University) chaired the opening session of the Conference, reviewing the status of
therapeutic clinical trials for children and adults with NF1 and NF2, an area that has seen a
dramatic increase in activity over the past few years. The earliest NF1 clinical trial efforts
were funded by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program for
Neurofibromatosis (CDMRP NFRP) and tested pirfenidone and farnesyl transferase
inhibitors in prospective plexiform neurofibroma studies. Though neither drug emerged as a
promising therapy, these trials paved the way for the design and implementation of NF1
biological agent trials. A major development came with the formation of the Phase II
Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium, established in 2005 and again, supported by
CDMRP NFRP. Dr. Packer chairs this program and he provided an update of progress. The
Phase II NF Clinical Trials Consortium includes 9 core sites in the United States. Additional
sites, including international collaborators, may be included for selected studies. The Phase

II NF Clinical Trials Consortium is focused on designing and implementing trials for NF1
manifestations; these include benign plexiform neurofibroma, optic pathway glioma or
dermal neurofibroma tumors; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors; bone abnormalities
such as tibial dysplasia; or learning disabilities.

The first trial of the Phase II NF Clinical Trials Consortium is evaluating the mTOR
inhibitor Rapamycin in NF1 patients with progressive plexiform neurofibromas. The trial
utilizes three-dimensional volumetric analysis imaging to monitor growth and shrinkage in
these tumors which are often diffuse and otherwise difficult to measure. Prior natural history
studies have shown that the time to progression for plexiform neurofibromas is 10.6 months
on placebo, and these data will be used as the comparison arm for the Rapamycin Phase II
clinical trials. This first trial of the Phase II NF Clinical Trials Consortium has completed
accrual in patients with symptomatic disease, and is near completion of initial accrual goals
for patients with radiographically progressive disease. The trial may be expanded to include
patients with progressive lesions.

The second trial of the Phase II NF Clinical Trials Consortium is evaluating Lovastatin for
the treatment of cognitive deficits, particularly visuospatial learning and attention, in a
prospective, placebo-controlled randomized trial for children with NF1 between 10 and 17
years of age. This study opened in summer 2009. The third trial of the Phase II NF Clinical
Trials Consortium was outlined by Nicole Ullrich (Children’s Hospital Boston) and will
assess a novel mTOR inhibitor RAD-001 in NF1 patients with progressive low-grade
gliomas. Finally, a proposal has recently been submitted to the Phase II NF Clinical Trials
Consortium to assess a new biologic agent in NF1 patients with recurrent malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). This trial would be conducted in conjunction
with the national Sarcoma Clinical Trials Consortium.

Ype Elgersma (Erasmus University, the Netherlands) described the results of a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 62 children evaluating whether the related statin
drug simvastatin, might improve neuropsychological outcome in children with NF1. Though
no clear-cut clinical improvement was seen with simvastatin treatment, there were a number
of limitations in this study including marked practice effect in outcome measures in both
controls and treated patients, inclusion of children with intellectual impairment, inclusion of
patients on stimulant medication and very short duration of treatment on full dosage. These
limitations have been taken into account in the design of the CDMRP Consortium’s
Lovastatin study described above; in addition only children with deficits in the primary
outcome measures will be included in the current trial – since these demonstrated the
greatest response to Simvastatin in the Netherlands study.

Brigitte Widemann (National Cancer Institute) reviewed data from recently completed and
ongoing clinical trials for children and adults with symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas.
These included: completed oral farnesyl transferase inhibitor trial and completed pirfenidone
trials; an ongoing phase II study utilizing interferon and another utilizing Imatinib mesylate;
and a phase I trial of sorafenib which targets Raf and other kinases. The patient entry and
evaluation criteria of these trials are slightly different from each other. Other studies are
planned for treatment of recurrent MPNSTs, including the addition of biologic agents to
standard chemotherapy.

Scott Plotkin (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital) described an
ongoing trial assessing the effect of ranibizumab on the growth of dermal neurofibromas.
Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody for VEGF-A, and could potentially inhibit
vascularization of dermal neurofibromas and thereby halt growth. In addition to assessing

the local response to Ranibizumab injection in dermal neurofibromas, the trial will assess
circulating angiogenic proteins in blood and tumors of NF1 patients.

Madeleine Duvic (MD Anderson Cancer Center) discussed how trials are conducted for
other, non-NF cutaneous syndromes including malignancies. From these trials, she
suggested several therapeutic targets that may be worth investigating as NF1 dermal
neurofibromas therapy approaches. These included mTOR, histone deacetylase inhibitors
such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or Ras pathway inhibitors such as farnesyl-protein
transferase inhibitors.

The recent development of consensus recommendations for conducting NF2 clinical trials
[Evans et al., 2009] has resulted in commencement of clinical trials in this arena. NF2
patients may develop several tumor types in the brain and peripheral nerves including
vestibular schwannoma (VS, the hallmark of the disease), cranial or spinal nerve
schwannoma, peripheral nerve schwannoma, ependymoma or meningioma. Two trials are
now open for NF2 patients, both focusing on VS endpoints. Jaishri Blakeley (Johns Hopkins
University) described the first NF2 trial, a ‘Phase 0’ study, assessing delivery of the ErbB2/
EGFR inhibitor Lapatinib to tumor tissue and the effects of the drug on the targeted
pathways within tissue. Patients may enroll if they have a scheduled VS surgery; drug is
given prior to surgery, and the tumor may be examined after removal to see if the drug
reached it. This study is designed to rapidly assess if a promising agent can reach the tumor
site and, if successful, may rapidly progress to Phase II trials. The second NF2 study,
presented by Harry Miao (PTC Therapeutics), is a Phase II trial of PTC299, a new drug
entity that inhibits VEGF synthesis upstream via interruption of posttranscriptional
processing, and thus decreases angiogenesis. The goal is to reduce blood perfusion and
correspondingly VS volume, and potentially maintain or restore hearing for NF2 patients.
This trial will enroll NF2 patients who have progressive growth of VS with hearing loss.

The session concluded with two presentations on Children’s Tumor Foundation initiatives to
help accelerate NF clinical trials. Looking ahead to new drug therapies and drug targets,
Mila McCurrach (Children’s Tumor Foundation) presented an update on the Children’s
Tumor Foundation NF Preclinical Consortium (NFPC), which screens promising candidate
drugs in parallel in multiple NF1 and NF2 tumor models. NFPC is making headway in
engaging pharmaceutical companies: the first drug partnership tests Novartis drug BEZ-235,
a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Mindell Seidlin (Children’s Tumor Foundation) spoke about a
new initiative of the Foundation to develop a NF1 Biobank and Patient Registry. This
resource would serve in part as the return pathway for translational research by facilitating
investigation of patient-derived tissues to identify new therapeutic targets.

The clinical trials presentations indicated that there has been remarkable progress over the
past few years in the development and testing of therapeutics in well-designed, statistically
sound clinical trials for several of the disease processes that impact NF1 and NF2 patients.

NEW NF THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND PRECLINICAL DRUG SCREENING
Nancy Ratner (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center) chaired a session that looked
ahead to future drug targets and therapeutic approaches for NF. Ruihong Chen (NexGenix
Pharmaceuticals) discussed a new drug therapy for dermal neurofibromas (DNFs) which
develop in the large majority of adults with NF1. DNFs can range in number from a few to
several thousand in one individual, and though benign, these tumors can cause
disfigurement, pain and pruritus. Surgical removal of DNFs requires multiple injections of
anesthetic or costly general anesthesia. Data from DNF cell-based assays, explants and
xenografts, as well as from small proof-of-principle NF1 clinical trial conducted in Mexico
City and Rio de Janeiro, employing a specially formulated drug doxycycline (NX101) were

assessed in treatment of DNFs. This drug is an antibiotic in wide usage with known vascular
disruption and possible antiangiogenic capabilities. The NF1 trial conducted was a proof-of-
principle open-label single dose clinical trial. From these trials NX101 was reported to be
quite effective in clearing DNFs, causing vascular disruption, necrosis and clearing of
lesions within days after 1–2 injections, with minimal side effects including minor pruritus
and discomfort at the injection site. No complications or evidence of re-growth of lesions
were observed in follow-up visits that extended to 12 months.

While activation of Ras and its down-stream effectors are observed in only some MPNST
cell lines, Faris Farassati (University of Kansas) showed that RalA is activated in all studied
mouse and human MPNST cell lines, and in MPNST tumor samples as compared to non-
transformed Schwann cells. Although highly similar to Ras, Ral proteins (RalA and RalB)
activate different effectors, influencing gene expression and translation through interaction
with ZO-1 associated nucleic acid binding protein and RalA binding protein 1. Silencing Ral
or using a dominant negative Ral reduced proliferation, invasiveness, and in-vivo
tumorigenicity of MPNST cells, and reduced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition markers. Expression of NF1-GAP-related domain diminished the levels of Ral
activation, implicating neurofibromin in regulating RalA activation. Exposure of MPNST
cells to concentrations of geranyl-geranyl trasferase inhibitors which reduced Ral activation
but had no significant effects on Ras activation decreased cell proliferation, implicating the
Ral pathway as a target for therapy of MPNST.

Geoffrey Kilili (Tufts University), a predoctoral fellow in the laboratory of John Kyriakis, is
following leads from the Drosophila model where the orthologues of Merlin act upstream of
and positively regulate the tumor suppressor Hippo (hpo), the Drosophila orthologue of the
mammalian Ste20 like kinases 1&2 (Mst1&2). In mammals, the MAP3K protein Raf-1
interacts and negatively regulates Mst2. To determine if Merlin acts upstream of Mst2 in
human cells and to elucidate the role of the hippo pathway in mitogen mediated MAPK
signaling they used RNAi knock down and adenoviral over expression systems. Importantly,
these investigators found that Merlin did not act upstream of or positively regulate Mst2 in
mammalian cells. Knockdown of Mst2 led to increased phosphorylation of Raf-1, decreased
Raf-1 kinase activity, MEK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Raf-1
hyperphosphorylation persisted after elimination of the PI3K/AKT signaling, a known Raf-1
targeting pathway. These data indicate that Mst2 has a positive role in mitogen mediated
MAPK signaling via suppression of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1 on S259
through a mechanism that does not involve the PI3K/AKT pathway [O'Neill et al., 2004;
Hamartoglu et al., 2006].

C. Oliver Hanemann (Peninsula College for Medicine and Dentistry, United Kingdom) also
described candidate drug therapies for NF2. Merlin loss causes benign schwannomas which
show enhanced Rac1, Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) activities. PAK regulates
the activation of merlin; however, the role of PAK in the Rac pathway is insufficiently
characterized. The group used a peptide inhibitor of the PixGEF interaction with Rac and a
novel small molecule PAK inhibitor, IPA-3, to investigate the role of PAK activation on
Rac1/Cdc42 activity, cell spreading and adhesion in human primary schwannoma and
Schwann cells. In summary, IPA-3 blocks activation of PAK2 at Ser192/197, antagonizing
interaction between PAK and Pix, resulting in decreased Pix-mediated Rac1 activation.
They concluded that PAK acts upstream of Rac, and confirm studies showing that Rac
activation in schwannoma cells is essential for cell spreading and adhesion. These studies
support PAK as a potential therapeutic target in schwannomas [Flaiz et al., 2009a, 2009b].

Ronen Marmorstein (The Wistar Institute) discussed several kinases downstream of Ras and
Rac that are constitutively activated in many cancers, including schwannomas and

neurofibromas, making them important drug targets. Three such kinases are BRAF, PI3K
and PAK1. Given that inhibitors to these kinases have not yet progressed beyond clinical
trials, this team of investigators combined synthetic chemistry, small-molecule screening
and structural biology to develop novel organometallic inhibitors that show high potency
and selectivity for these kinases. In each case, he reported on inhibitors with IC50 values in
the mid-nanomolar range and with a high degree of kinase isoform selectivity and that
function in cells. He also reported on the X-ray crystal structures of these inhibitors bound to
their respective kinase targets revealing the molecular basis for inhibition and avenues for
further inhibitor development. Together, these inhibitors provide lead compounds for the
development of drugs to treat cancers of the nervous system.

Nancy Ratner described the progress of the NF1 microarray consortium. To identify novel
biomarkers and therapeutic targets to fight NF1, this group have used transcriptional
profiling to distinguish primary normal Schwann cells (n = 10) from NF1-derived primary
Schwann cells, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, and benign and
malignant tumors (n = 67). Dr. Ratner reported on validation of differential expression of 82
genes including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted
transcriptional targets. For example, SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in neurofibroma
and MPSNT tissue sections. Using shRNAs targeting genes up-regulated in neurofibromas
and MPNST they are testing the role of SOX9 and its targets in cell growth and
tumorigenesis. Targeting SOX9 caused MPNST cell death. SOX9 regulates EYA4 which is
highly expressed in MPNST. EYA proteins interact with Dachsund (DACH) and/or SIX
proteins to bind DNA and regulate gene transcription. Thus SOX9 is a biomarker of
neurofibroma and MPNST, and SOX9 and its downstream targets may represent therapeutic
targets in NF1 [Williams et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2009].

Karlyne Reilly (National Cancer Institute - Frederick) is investigating a very interesting
novel natural product that is a therapeutic candidate for NF1 tumors. She presented data
showing that it appears to target cells that have homozygous loss of Nf1, while wild-type
and Nf1−/+ cells are resistant to the effects of the natural product. The group determined
that the natural product inhibits multiple tumor types associated with NF1. NF1-specific
natural products may form the basis for NF1-specific therapy in the future.

UNRAVELING THE SIGNALING PATHWAYS OF NF

A signaling-focused session chaired by Vijaya Ramesh (Harvard Medical School/
Massachusetts General Hospital) and Frank McCormick (University of California, San
Francisco) spanned talks on NF2/merlin functions, Schwann cell biology and NF1/Ras
signaling. The session opened with Brendan Manning (Harvard School of Public Health)
giving an overview of the complexity of mTOR signaling. There is significant convergence
of many tumor suppressors on the mTORC1 pathway including NF1, NF2, PTEN, LKB1,
TSC1 and TSC2. However, the downstream consequences of aberrant mTORC1 activation
and therapeutic response of these different tumor suppressor syndromes remain poorly
understood. The Manning laboratory focuses on the cellular and molecular effects of
uncontrolled mTORC1 activity in TSC, via a combination of TSC gene disruption and
rapamycin treatment to activate and inhibit mTORC1 respectively. From this system, his
group has identified and characterized a set of transcripts that are strictly regulated by
mTORC1 signaling. They have also shown that aberrant mTORC1 signaling can trigger
adaptive stress response pathways that dampen the deleterious effects of metabolic changes
and uncontrolled protein synthesis. The approaches taken by Dr. Manning’s laboratory offer
novel points of therapeutic intervention and may provide potential targets of cytotoxic
agents to selectively kill tumor cells exhibiting elevated mTORC1 activity, a molecular
defect common to NF1, NF2 and TSC.

Chunling Yi (The Wistar Institute), a postdoctoral fellow in the group of Joseph Kissil, has
purified a novel protein complex composed of merlin and a number of tight junction
associated proteins. A direct interaction between merlin and the tight junction proteins as
well as co-localization of the proteins to both tight junctions and adherens junctions were
presented. One of the interacting proteins was shown to function downstream of merlin as a
positive regulator of Rac-Pak and MAPK signaling. This study elegantly demonstrated a
novel merlin-mediated signaling route at the site of cell:cell junctions, which may contribute
to the tumor suppressive function of merlin.

Marlan Hansen (University of Iowa) presented data suggesting that ErbB2 and c-Jun N-
terminal kinase (JNK) signaling contribute to vestibular schwannoma growth and
radiosensitivity. ErbB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for Schwann cell development
and proliferation resides in lipid rafts and is active in vestibular schwannoma (VS) cells. In
addition, MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JNK signaling are active in VS cells, which is
independent of ErbB2 signaling. Inhibition of JNK resulted in VS cell apoptosis and an
increase in radiosensitivity.

Betty Chow (Fox Chase Cancer Center), a postdoctoral fellow in the group of Jonathan
Chernoff, showed that a peptide inhibitor of Pak1, Pak2 and Pak3 restored normal
morphology and slowed the growth of cells transformed with a dominant mutant allele of
merlin. Xenografts of cells expressing the peptide inhibitor showed markedly reduced
growth, when compared with cells expressing an inactive mutant form of this inhibitor. The
growth of the xenograft tumors did not correlate with the level of ERK activation, indicating
that the effects of Pak on cell proliferation and tumor growth are not mediated by ERK.

Pablo Hollstein (Harvard Medical School) discussed the molecular mechanisms by which
neurofibromin is degraded during normal cell signaling. He reported identification of a E3
ubiquitin ligase that is specifically required for neurofibromin degradation. Depletion of this
ubiquitin ligase specifically attenuates Ras signaling, resulting in impaired cellular
proliferation. Dr Hollstein suggested that understanding the mechanisms that regulate
neurofibromin degradation may provide the opportunity for designing or applying effective
therapies aimed at increasing neurofibromin protein stability, a strategy that may be most
useful in manifestations related to haploinsufficiency at the NF1 locus, which has been
shown to contribute to some symptoms of the disease. Regulation of neurofibromin
degradation might also be a useful strategy in other conditions driven by hyperactive Ras
and cell proliferation.

Frank McCormick discussed therapeutic approaches to the Ras pathway, with special
emphasis of the issue of “oncogene addiction”. According to this concept, cancer cells often
become increasingly dependent on driver oncogenes for their survival, and therefore respond
dramatically when these drivers are blocked through therapeutic intervention. In the case of
NF1, Shannon, Lauchle and colleagues (submitted for publication) showed that early stages
of myeloid disease associated with NF1 are not sensitive to intervention, using MEK
inhibitors, but later stages that progress to AML, become sensitive. This suggests that drugs
blocking hyperactive Ras signaling may have little effect on normal tissue in NF1 patients,
but could selectively inhibit advanced disease. Dr McCormick also discussed intrinsic
cellular pathways, involving ephrin signaling and sprouty-like proteins that regulate normal
Ras and could, potentially, be a source of new drug targets to treat this disease.

Karen Cichowski (Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women’s Hospital) discussed the
use of mouse models to optimize treatment protocols for treating NF1. While mTOR
inhibitors are currently being tested in the clinic, it is likely that sequential or combination
therapies may ultimately be more effective. The Cichowski group has been delineating

mechanisms of NF1 pathogenesis and investigating the biology of therapeutic response in
these models. Responses in vitro have, so far, not been predictive of efficacy in vivo,
stressing the importance of advanced mouse models to properly mimic disease and therefore
predict response. In glioblastoma, loss of neurofibromin occurs through deletion of the gene
and through increased turnover and degradation, a process initiated by PKC. These insights
may be useful in identifying new therapeutic approaches to NF1.

Jan Manent (INSERM, France) presented data evaluating the transcriptome of Nf2-deficient
primary mouse Schwann cells (SCs) and tumors from mice and patients. In mouse SCs, loss
of Nf2 led to the activation of a molecular program reminiscent of myelination via the PI3K/
Akt pathway. Mouse schwannoma transcription profiles share striking similarity to
developing immature SCs and comparison of mouse and human schwannoma gene
expression revealed common transcriptional signature. The data presented suggested that
NF2 protein plays a role in axon-SC crosstalk and that loss of this specific function may be
relevant to schwannoma formation.

Steven Scherer (University of Pennsylvania) provided an overview on junctional
specialization of Schwann cells. Myelinating Schwann cells have gap, tight and adherens
junctions that are composed of connexin32, claudin-19 and E-cadherin respectively. In
addition, they have specialized contacts with the axons at the nodes of Ranvier and the
flanking paranodal region mediated by a different set of cell adhesion molecules. Cultured
normal Schwann cells are joined by adherens junctions comprised of N-cadherin. Beta-
catenin is associated with the adherens junctions of myelinating, non-myelinating and
cultured normal Schwann cells. In contrast, NF2-deficient Schwannoma cells revealed
poorly formed adherens junctions and an irregular distribution of N-cadherin and Beta-
catenin, which has been implicated in tumorigenesis.

Andrea McClatchey (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital) presented
on behalf of her predoctoral fellow Zachary Morris and showed how merlin controls EGFR
distribution and signaling. Employing single particle tracking of individual EGFR
molecules, it was shown that merlin immobilizes EGFR at the cell surface in confluent
mouse-derived cells. Furthermore, merlin appears to govern the mobility and distribution of
EGFR within the plasma membrane in a contact-independent manner. The efficacy of
several EGFR inhibitors was tested in preclinical in vitro studies and pilot study results
indicated that the compounds were effective in blocking proliferation and signaling in Nf2−/
− mouse cells.

Ueli Suter (ETH Zürich, Switzerland) closed the session with a focus on Rho-GTPases in
Schwann cells. The role of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in Schwann cell migration,
proliferation and morphological changes associated with the sorting, ensheathment and
myelination of axons was reviewed as well as the roles of RhoGTPase and AKT signaling in
signal transduction in Schwann cell development.

CELLULAR ORIGIN OF NF TUMORS

Helen Morrison (Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Germany) chaired a session featuring
talks that highlighted identifying the cell or origin or tumor initiating cells in NF tumors.
The cancer stem cell (CSC) model of tumors has received tremendous attention in recent
years, but the concept that tumor development is fundamentally a problem of stem cell
biology remains somewhat controversial. The ‘CSC hypothesis’ suggests that tumors derive
from a subset of mutated stem cells that possess characteristics associated with a normal
stem cell such as self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate into actively proliferating
tumor cells. Such cells are proposed to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy and
considered to be a persistent and distinct sub population of cells that can give rise to new

tumors. While the CSC hypothesis is a significant contribution, challenging questions
remain. For example, do such cells really represent a minority population? What is the exact
cell of origin of CSCs - stem cells that have lost the ability to regulate proliferation, or
specialized cells from the adult tissue have acquired a stem-cell-like state? It is possible that
several answers are correct, dependent on tumor type and phenotype. Identifying tumor
initiating cells and whether they follow the CSC model or not is critical for a complete
understanding of tumor behavior and has fundamental implications for therapeutic
strategies. As an example, despite progress in understanding the molecular biology of
malignant astrocytomas, a tumor with increased occurrence in NF1, the clinical prognosis of
these brain tumors continues to be dismal. The development of therapeutic interventions,
and ability to anticipate tumor behavior, are limited because the cell of origin of the tumor is
unknown. Astrocytomas were originally thought to arise from differentiated glial cells that
then undergo a process of dedifferentiation, but initiation of tumor formation in mature
differentiated astrocytes in vivo has never been properly tested. In addition the recent
identification of adult neural stem cells provokes the question whether these immature cells
are in fact the targets of tumor causing mutations.

Sheila Alcantara (University of Texas Southwestern), a postdoctoral fellow in the group of
Luis Parada, presented a study focused on identifying the tumor cell of origin in a mouse
model of malignant astrocytoma. The Parada group has previously developed a tumor-
developing mouse models containing a conditional inactivation of human astrocytoma-
relevant tumor suppressors p53, Nf1, and Pten [Zhu et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2008]. Tumor
suppressor inactivation in neural stem cells or progenitor cells are both necessary and
sufficient to induce astrocytoma formation as demonstrated via specific in vivo gene
targeting to ‘neurogenic niches’ such as the subventricular zone of the brain. Strikingly, the
mice develop astrocytomas and the transformed cells undergo infiltration and multilineage
differentiation. The tumor suppressor targeted neural stem/progenitor cultures from
presymptomatic mice showed a growth advantage and altered differentiation, identifying a
pre-tumorigenic cell population. This is the first report that normal neural stem/progenitor
cells in vivo are cancer-initiating cells that can give rise to high-grade astrocytomas. Taken
together these findings indicate the existence of CSC in malignant astrocytoma.

Johanna Buchstaller (University of Michigan), a postdoctoral fellow in the group of Sean
Morrison, presented work identifying the tumor initiating cells in malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNST). MPNSTs are very aggressive and invasive soft tissue sarcomas
that appear in approximately 10% of patients with neurofibromatosis. Previous work from
the Morrison group has addressed the question of whether cancers are driven by rare
subpopulations of CSCs. While they appreciate that the cancer stem cell model is an
important new idea they have suggested that the design of certain mouse transplantation
experiments underestimates the frequency of human cancer cells that are capable of
contributing to disease progression. Using highly immunocompromised modified mice and
transplanting human melanoma cells they could already demonstrate that a significant
fraction of melanoma cells have common tumorigenic attributes, even when such cells
appear rare in other less immunocompromised mice [Quintana et al., 2008)]. They propose a
model in which some human cancers follow a cancer stem cell model whereby disease
progression is driven by small subpopulations of cancer stem cells, while other cancers do
not follow this model. Assessing whether a cancer has rare or common tumorigenic potential
is critical when designing therapeutic strategies. Cancers that follow a cancer stem cell
model might be treated with therapies that target cancer stem cells. In contrast, for cancers in
which tumorigenic potential is a more common attribute, therapies would have to target the
majority of the cells in the tumor.

Dr. Buchstaller presented work aimed at determining whether the progression of MPNSTs
follows a cancer stem cell model. They employed mouse models for MPNSTs bearing
mutations in Nf1, Ink4Arf and p53, genes that are relevant for human patients, in which they
have previously shown that MPNSTs appear to arise from differentiated glia and not neural
crest stem cells [Joseph et al., 2008]. Performing limiting dilution transplantation assays,
they found that a high number of cells isolated from primary MPNSTs of Nf1+/− Ink4aARF
−/− mice were able to transfer disease when transplanted into syngenic mice. These results
suggest that growth of MPNSTs in this mouse model does not follow a cancer stem cell
model and that most tumor cells are capable of forming new tumors. These studies have
fundamental implications for therapeutic strategies for MPNSTs, suggesting all cancer cells
need to be targeted during tumor therapy bearing these mutations [Joseph et al. 2008].

NF2 AND SCHWANNOMATOSIS – WHATS NEW?

This session, chaired by Joseph Kissil (The Wistar Institute) offered an update on the
progress and major open questions in NF2 and schwannomatosis. Allan Belzberg (Johns
Hopkins University) opened with several case studies that demonstrated the current and
urgent need for a study to delineate the natural history of schwannomatosis. While
diagnostic criteria have been established, there is a paucity of information regarding the
underlying genetic mechanisms and the natural course of the disease that significantly
hampers the development of therapeutic approaches. Belzberg described a new initiative to
address this, i.e. assembly of a schwannomatosis natural history database. A panel of
international clinical experts will develop the questions to form a new schwannomatosis-
centered database that will include a case-reporting interface. These studies will provide
preliminary information regarding the natural history of the disease and assess the utility of
developing and expanding the database worldwide.

Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital)
went on to present exciting data regarding the expression status of the in sporadic and
familial cases of schwannomatosis, NF2 and sporadic, solitary schwannomas. The findings
indicate that loss of expression of SMARCB1/INI1 is seen not only in schwannomatosis
associated schwannomas, but also in NF2 associated schwannomas. This contrasts with
solitary, sporadic schwannomas in which most tumors retain INI1 expression suggestive that
the pathogenesis of solitary sporadic tumors is different than that of hereditary and multiple
schwannoma syndromes [Patil et al., 2008]. Furthermore, INI1 loss of expression is much
more common in schwannomatosis associated schwannomas than the reported rates of INI1/
SMARCB1 mutations found in other series implying that other, epigenetic mechanisms may
be responsible for silencing the INI1 gene in some cases [Boyd et al., 2008; Hadfield et al.,
2008].

Emmanuelle di Tomaso (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital)
presented some exciting new data on an NF2 clinical trial. First, she and her colleagues
examined vascular patterning, vessel morphology and expression of angiogenic molecules
such as VEGF, VEGFR2, NRP1 and NRP2 in vestibular schwannoma specimens, and the
results suggested a role for VEGF in schwannoma pathophysiology. Next, 10 patients with
progressive vestibular schwannomas and chronic progressive hearing loss in their only
hearing ear were treated by an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. Overall results were
encouraging with the majority of tumors shrinking and a hearing response was seen in 4 of 6
patients (66%) who were capable of hearing improvement. The results suggest that the
pathophysiology of hearing loss from neurofibromatosis-associated vestibular schwannomas
is related, in part, to the action of VEGF and provide the first evidence that a medical
treatment can restore functional hearing in a subset of NF2 patients [Plotkin et al., 2009].

Gareth Evans (St. Mary’s Hospital, University of Manchester) described the significant
diagnostic and prognostic dilemma associated with diagnosing patients with schwannomas.
The approach taken in attempt to resolve this is to establish if schwannomas could be
differentiated on the basis of gene expression profiling. By comparing array profiles from
different schwannomas, normal nerve and fibromas, a set of transcripts was identified that
exhibit significant differential expression between the schwannoma subtypes and between
controls and schwannomas. Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the gene
expression in NF2 and unilateral vestibular schwannomas (UVs) is very similar as reflected
by the small number of genes that are differentially expressed between these two groups. In
addition, there was no apparent clustering correlating to the size of tumor, location (right/
left) or gender of the patient. A few differentially expressed genes were identified in NF2
schwannomas relative to schwannomatosis and in both NF2 and UVS schwannomas relative
to schwannomatosis. These studies provide an initial molecular phenotype to aid
differentiation of schwannomas subtypes and predict clinical outcome and may provide
targets for therapeutic intervention.

Rachael Hornigold (Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust) discussed the appropriateness and
timing of surgical intervention in NF2. The majority of patients will undergo multiple
surgical procedures within their lifetime, many resulting in significant postoperative deficits.
A retrospective case note analysis examined the number and timing of surgical procedures
and post-operative complications. These were correlated to a number of parameters
including tumor type and burden, associated clinical features, age at presentation and
genotype. Of the cohort examined, over 75% of patients have undergone some form of
surgical intervention, with a mean of three procedures. 39.5% of patients had surgery prior
to diagnosis with NF2, and 74.4% had surgery prior to specialist review. Management
within a multi-disciplinary clinic and correct timing of surgical procedures is essential to
avoid unnecessary complications and to avoid the need for emergency intervention.

Vijaya Ramesh (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital) presented
exciting new data implicating merlin as a novel regulator of TSC/mTORC1 signaling and
described the identification of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as
a novel mediator of merlin’s tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma
and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells exhibit rapamycin sensitive constitutive mTORC1
activation and increased growth. Also, NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient MEFs,
demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling and, conversely, the exogenous expression of
wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived mutant, L64P, suppresses mTORC1
signaling. It appears Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established PI3K-Akt or
MAPK/ERK-mediated TSC2 inactivation, and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling
in a novel fashion. These findings suggest that rapamycin or rapamycin analogues in
combination with PI3K inhibitors, may provide promise as new therapeutics in the treatment
of NF2-associated meningiomas and schwannomas.

NOVEL CELLULAR AND ANIMAL MODELS OF NF

Michel Kalamarides (Hopital Beaujon, Paris) chaired a session focused on novel cellular and
animal models that are a vital resource for NF research. Dr. Kalamarides first reported a new
mouse model of NF2 meningioma which account for one third of all primary central nervous
system tumors. The frequent NF2 gene inactivation event in human meningiomas has been
utilized to generate this meningioma mouse model and while it represents a significant
advance in meningioma modeling, questions persist as to the meningioma cell of origin
[Kalamarides et al., 2002]. To address this, the Kalamarides group has identified a specific
marker of mouse and human arachnoid cells, the prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS). This
arachnoid-specific promoter has been used to generate conditional Nf2 knockout mice with

restricted biallelic Nf2 inactivation in the primordial meninges, before formation of the
meningeal layers. Using genetic and injection methods (adCre) the group found that the
timing of Nf2 biallelic inactivation in a PGDS+ meningeal precursor cell is responsible for
the developmental heterogeneity of meningioma subtypes. Pre-natal and early postnatal
biallelic Nf2 inactivation in PGDS+ progenitor cells can give rise to meningiomas, whereas
more mature cells cannot. Together, this study not only has established a novel mouse model
for meningioma, but also provided important insights into the cell of origin of the different
histological subtypes of meningiomas.

Larry Sherman (Oregon Health & Science University) is exploring the role of SWI/SNF
factors in Schwann cells as potential regulators of pain and tumor growth in
schwannomatosis. Mutations in the SNF5 gene (also called SMARCB1 and INI1) have been
observed in schwannomas from schwannomatosis patients. SNF5 is a subunit of SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complexes that can regulate both cell cycle progression and the
transcriptional activation of a wide range of genes. They observed Schwann cell hyper
proliferation along peripheral nerves of mice with conditional mutations in brahma-related
gene-1 (Brg1), an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF complexes. This effect was cell autonomous
as loss of Brg1 in primary cultures of Schwann cells was sufficient to induce a 2–3 fold
increase in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake in vitro. In contrast, mice with conditional
mutations in the Snf5 gene and Snf5-null Schwann cells grown in vitro did not display
significant changes in Schwann cell proliferation. Interestingly, they found that rhabdoid
tumors with SNF5 mutations have elevated levels of transcripts of a member of the
neurotrophin family of growth factors brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and that
Schwann cells lacking Snf5 express twice the amount of a BDNF as wild type Schwann
cells. Indeed, growing evidence has implicated BDNF in neuropathic pain and increased
pain sensitivity. They are currently testing if these effects on sensory neurons can be
reversed by BDNF-neutralizing antibodies, and whether mice with conditional Snf5
mutations have increased pain sensitivity.

Andrew B. Gladden (Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School) a
postdoctoral fellow from the group of Andrea McClatchey presented work on the role of the
NF2 protein merlin on the regulation of the epithelial cell polarity and proliferation. The
group has previously shown that Merlin function is critical for the establishment of adherens
junctions (AJ) and contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation in cells. Given the
requirement for merlin in AJ formation in vitro and the importance of cell junction and
polarity components in the basal cells of the skin, they investigated the function of Merlin
during skin development in vivo. They found that K14-Cre;Nf2lox/lox mice display a
dramatic epidermal phenotype with little initial hair growth and severe dehydration leading
to death during early postnatal development. Histological analysis of K14-Cre;Nf2lox/lox
skin reveals a pronounced expansion of the epidermal progenitor cell population in the basal
layer. This expansion can be ascribed to altered cell:cell communication and defective basal
cell polarity during skin development. In fact, molecular studies suggest that merlin is a vital
bridge between AJ and polarity components. These studies introduce new evidence for a
role for merlin in epithelial progenitor cell adhesion, proliferation and polarity and provide a
platform for further studies of merlin function in these processes.

Lou Chang (University of Michigan) presented two novel murine models that generate NF1-
related MPNST with high penetrance. The two models differ in their timing of Nf1
inactivation, where one model losses Nf1 in conjunction with p53, while the other model
inactivates Nf1 first with subsequent loss of p53. While both models produce MPNSTs,
when Nf1 was inactivated prior to p53 loss, neurofibromas also developed, mimicking NF1
patients. Comparison of these two mouse models enables elucidation of the role of
neurofibromas in MPNST development. From a pre-clinical view, these novel murine

models develop large numbers of MPNSTs, allowing testing of diagnostic markers to
differentiate benign from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and offer improved NF1
models for pre-clinical therapeutic trials.

Yuan Zhu (University of Michigan) provided important insights into the role of the Nf1
heterozygous microenvironment in the development of benign and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors. In their study, by using a conditional Nf1 allele, this group established
a mouse model that develops plexiform neurofibromas throughout the PNS (extending along
the length of peripheral nerves and involving multiple branches of large nerves in humans)
as well as discrete neurofibromas in the skin (typically small, localized and often arising in
the dermis or epidermis in humans). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the Nf1
heterozygous microenvironment is critical for neurofibromas progression, but not for
initiation or malignant transformation. This study has added a novel mouse model for
neurofibromas and MPNST, and also provided important insights into the role of the Nf1
heterozygous microenvironment in the development of benign and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor.

Walter J. Jessen (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center) a postdoctoral fellow in
the group of Nancy Ratner presented work on the nerve gene expression patterning in NF1
mouse models. To elucidate the molecular changes that occur, they compared the
transcriptome of adult nerves from five mouse models CNPase-hEGFR/+, CNPase-hEGFR/
EGFR, CNP-HRas12V/+, DhhCre;Nf1 flox/flox and NPcis and evaluated changes in gene
expression relative to Nf1 flox/− and Nf1 flox/flox controls. The group identified 1,783
transcripts statistically different (p = 0.01) and performed unsupervised two-way
hierarchical cluster analysis to distinguish specific subtypes. They identified different
principle patterns of gene expression and assessed each cluster to explore the potential
biological significance. Transcripts up- or down-regulated across all mouse nerve samples
were enriched for genes associated with apoptotic regulation, unfolded protein response,
nervous system development, angiogenesis and cell cycle progression. Transcripts up- or
down-regulated across NPcis, DhhCre;Nf1 flox/flox, CNPase-hEGFR/+ and a subset of CNP-
HRas12V/+ nerve samples were enriched for genes associated with complement and
coagulation cascades, wound healing, cell adhesion and migration, and the intermediate
filament cytoskeleton. Lastly, transcripts up- or down-regulated across CNPasehEGFR/+,
CNPase-hEGFR/EGFR and DhhCre;Nf1 flox/flox nerve samples were enriched for genes
associated with intermediate filament bundle assembly, nervous system development,
angiogenesis, Wnt signaling, cell adhesion, response to wounding, cholesterol biosynthesis,
and the endoplasmic reticulum. These preliminary results demonstrate that transcriptional
changes in NF1 mouse models are diverse and represent different molecular aspects of the
disease.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND MANAGEMENT OF NF

Victor-Felix Mautner (Eppendorf University, Hamburg) chaired a session reviewing updates
on some of the clinical features in NF and how these can be managed. Plexiform
neurofibromas occur in about 60% of NF1 patients and can lead to severe morbidity by
disfigurement or compression of vital structures, in addition these tumors can undergo or
malignant transformation to MPNSTs. However complete surgical resection of plexiform
tumors is rarely possible due to local infiltration of normal tissue. As an alternative to
standard drug therapies, Michael Fisher (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia) is conducting
a Phase I trial of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of regional plexiform tumors in
children. The trial will determine the maximal tolerated dose of light combined with a
systemically administered photosenitizer (talaporfin sodium).

Ian McCutcheon (MD Anderson Cancer Center) reviewed some of the features of NF 1
related MPNSTs. NF1 patients have a lifelong risk of 8–13% to develop MPNST. These
tumors arise from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas and in NF1 carry a high risk of
mortality: the five year disease survival in 72 NF1 patients with MPNST was 35% compared
to 50% in non-NF1 patients who had developed sporadic MPNSTs. Negative predictors of
disease survival in these patients were MPNSTs of greater than 10cm at diagnosis, partial
resection, and metastasis development. Improved clinical, pathological and molecular
staging for MPNST are needed to optimize the prognostication and management of these
tumors [Zou et al., 2009].

Determination of NF tumor growth patterns is essential to allow appropriate treatment
decisions and conventional MRI scans without volumetric measurements show an error
range up to 30% dependent on slice thickness. Gordon Harris (Harvard Medical School/
Massachusetts General Hospital) has established a centralized service that can receive MRI
scans electronically, perform volumetric analyses on these and report resulting images,
measurements and graphs.

Beside MPNST, vasculopathy is one of the most serious life threatening events that can
occur in NF1. However its pathogenesis is not well understood. Kimberly Jett (University of
British Columbia), a predoctoral student in the group of Jan Friedman, described a study in
which flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and glyceryl-trinitrate-mediated dilatation (NMD)
were carried out to assess vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell function. In addition,
polychromatic flow cytometry was used to test for evidence of vascular inflammatory cells
from the peripheral blood of NF1 patients. The FMD and NMD data demonstrate that
vascular endothelial function is altered in NF1 patients. The study also showed for the first
time that NF1 patients have evidence of chronic inflammation that could lead to subsequent
vascular disease.

Yemima Berman (Children’s Hospital, University Sydney) reported a study of 22 children
with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and NF1. VPI is a speech disorder resulting in
nasal sounding speech and reduced speech intelligibility. Amongst those patients with VPI,
10/22 (45.5%) had brainstem tumors and five (22.7%) had NF1 microdeletion. These
frequencies are much higher than usually expected within the NF1 population; 5–11% and
4.4% respectively. The frequency of brainstem tumors appears to increase with severity of
abnormal nasal airflow during speech. In five patients, VPI was detected prior to
identification of brainstem tumors, suggesting this may be a useful clinical sign for early
detection of brainstem tumors. This study suggests that VPI is an important and under-
recognized cause of morbidity amongst patients with NF1. VPI may also be a useful clinical
feature for identifying patients at increased risk of brainstem pathology and appears to be
more common amongst patients with NF1 microdeletion.

Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital)
described the problem of the multiplicity of terminologies used to describe neurofibromas in
the clinical practice of NF1. The use of multiple classification schemes by different
specialties is an impediment for transfer of knowledge between specialties and also between
mouse models and human pathology. The formulation of a unifying classification scheme
for neurofibromas has been developed by a panel of specialists representing multiple
disciplines.

CORRELATING THE NF1 PHENOTYPE AND GENOTYPE

phenotype, through work on identification of modifying genes and then an area about which
little work has been done- the natural history of NF1 in old age.

Bruce Korf (University of Alabama at Birmingham) highlighted the renewed interest in NF1
genotype-phenotype correlation that has resulted from the emergence of several related
recognizable phenotypes. Furthermore, the identification of SPRED1 as a non-allelic cause
of a dominantly inherited mild NF1-like phenotype (Legius syndrome) raises the possibility
that there may be other genes in the Ras/MAPK pathway which share the pigmented
phenotype. The other well recognized clinically significant genotypes are the NF1
microdeletions (usually associated with more severe neurofibroma burden and
developmental/learning issues) and the three base deletion in exon 17 (associated with lack
of neurofibroma development in adults). Another distinct phenotype associated with paucity
of dermal tumors but an extreme burden of internal tumors (spinal neurofibromatosis) is also
emerging; and this appears to be associated with an excess of missense and splice site
mutations. These emerging phenotypes and the overlap of Legius syndrome and NF1 mean
that consideration needs to be given to revision of the NF1 diagnostic criteria. Dr. Korf felt
more data were needed before this can be done. Dr. Korf also shared his groups work on
quantitative recording of clinical features to assist in accurate phenotyping and in
preparation for clinical trials. They are using a combination of serial photography and laser
scanning to quantify the number of dermal tumors and follow their growth rate.

The emerging genotype-phenotype correlations probably still account for no more than 10%
of an NF1 clinic population. For the majority of NF1 families there is significant intra-
familial variability and evidence for the role of modifying genes. Technological
developments mean that we should now be able to identify these. Andre Bernards (Harvard
Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital) provided an overview of his groups’ work
in Drosophila and humans. Drosophila NF1 null mutants exhibit a learning defect and a 20%
reduction in post-embryonic growth. They have identified a neuronal tyrosine kinase which
contributes to the phenotype. From human studies, patients with an NF1 microdeletion have
early onset of large numbers of neurofibromas. The Bernard’s group has performed
preliminary analysis of two conserved microRNA genes, 200 kb downstream of NF1, which
target the relevant pathway. The final approach that the group is about to embark on
involves a genome association study on samples from a large cohort of NF1 patients
selected for lower/higher numbers than average of dermal neurofibromas for their age.

Recent advances in MRI scanning offer new ways of measuring the internal tumor burden in
NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis. Scott Plotkin (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts
General Hospital) presented some preliminary data from an international prospective
observational study. The technique clearly gives excellent images, in a relatively short time,
without the use of ionising radiation. There is the option for doing PET scans when lesions
are > 5cms. The combined data from the first 143 subjects was presented. Sixty percent of
patients had at least one internal tumor. It will be interesting to see whether the study shows
evidence of benefit in patient management as this cohort of 250 patients is followed
prospectively.

John Mulvihill (University of Oklahoma) gave a progress report on their studies of an aspect
of NF1 about which little is known: the natural history and health needs in old age. Working
with NF1 research groups in Vancouver and Denmark, they are analysing existing
databases, reviewing previously identified NF1 cohorts and running focus groups to obtain a
multifaceted view of ageing in NF1, key issues raised at the focus groups.

RECENT ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING NF1 COGNITIVE DEFICITS

Kathryn North chaired this session and also provided the opening presentation to set the
stage on issues to consider in developing effective therapies and informative clinical trials.
NF1 is associated with a lowering IQ with median full scale IQ usually in the low 90s. Fifty
– sixty percent of children with NF1 have academic difficulties. Thirty-eight percent have
attention deficit disorders and there is a high frequency of specific deficits in visuospatial
function, executive function, working memory and receptive and expressive language.
Natural history studies have suggested that cognitive function in NF1 is static with age
compared to controls.

The NF1 cognitive phenotype is a composite of two types of deficit. 1: Cognitive deficits
that are developmental in origin and are likely to be irreversible. For example, increased
grey matter volume and increased cross-section of the corpus callosum are associated with
lower IQ; macrocephaly per se is not associated with lowered cognitive function. 2:
Cognitive deficits that are associated with the biochemical effects of loss of neurofibromin
in the Ras/MAPK pathway and are likely to be reversible. The aspects of cognitive
phenotype in NF1 that are likely to be reversible are attention, working memory and
learning (this correlates with the hippocampal defects seen in the mouse model of NF1). It
must be noted that IQ – as a measure of aptitude - is a composite of reversible and
irreversible deficits.

In design of pharmacological clinical trials for NF1, it is important to target aspects of
learning that are related to modulation of Ras/MAPK levels. For the Phase 2 Lovastatin trial
that has commenced mid 2009, the study protocol has been designed to target deficits
demonstrated to be reversible in Nf1 mouse model (eg hippocampal based visual memory
and learning presented by Alcino Silva and Jonathan Payne and described below) as well as
targeting deficits known to be common in NF1 (e.g. attention). Patients enrolled must have a
deficit in one of the primary outcome measures and should not be on other medications such
as stimulant medication that may influence reversible deficits.

Sheryl Rimrodt (Kennedy Krieger Institute) presented data from two ongoing studies
comparing children with NF1 associated with reading disability (NF+RD) and children with
idiopathic RD (IRD) to control participants. The first study suggests that the visual spatial
deficits in NF+RD appear to be more extensive than those required on the commonly used
JLO measure; NF+RD performance was impaired, relative to controls and IRD, on tasks
requiring visual closure and visualization of position in space. This result is distinct from
findings on more complex visual spatial tasks with increased working memory demands, on
which both RD groups (NF+RD and IRD) performed more similarly to each other than to
controls. The second is a clinical trial comparing two approaches to intensive instructional
intervention in both NF+RD and IRD; namely, it compares a strongly phonological
approach to a more visual spatially-based fluency approach. These preliminary data suggest
that children with NF+RD appear to respond to reading interventions.

Jonathan Payne (Children’s Hospital, University of Sydney) presented data concerning
extrapolation from the NF1 mouse behavioral phenotype to human clinical trials. When
considering the applicability of treatment effects in animals to humans, it is important to
understand the nature of the impairment across both species. NF1 +/− mice display
reversible impairments on the Morris water maze, a measure of visual learning that has been
shown to rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
Automated Battery (CANTAB) has been developed based on animal behavior paradigms to
facilitate cross-species studies of cognition. The Paired Associate Learning (PAL) subtest of
CANTAB measures changes in human hippocampal function, and this function is impaired

in over 40% of children with NF1, independent of IQ and attention. In addition the PAL has
multiple versions of the test to minimize practice effects as part of clinical trials. This
instrument is thus an ideal primary outcome measure to use in studies of therapy for
reversible cognitive deficits in NF1.

Ype Elgersma (Erasmus University, The Netherlands) presented data suggesting that exon
9a of the NF1 gene is important for regulating neuronal RAS activity. Although NF1 is
expressed in all cells of the central nervous system, expression of NF1 containing
alternatively spliced exon 9a is restricted to the CNS neurons with high expression in the
forebrain. Mice with mutant exon 9a have no change in total neurofibromin, but have
deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning with impaired function on the Morris water maze
and impaired LTP in the hippocampus.

Linnea Vose (New York Medical College), a predoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Frances
Hannan, described studies in the Drosophila NF1 model showing that Lovastatin placed in
food rescues adult learning after 24 hours of treatment. Adult flies were tested for learning
using an established associative learning protocol that measures the ability of the flies to
distinguish between two odors, one of which was paired with an electric shock. Drug testing
in larvae was also performed to replicate young patients with NF1. Larvae were tested using
a similar shock-odor protocol recently developed in their laboratory. Treatment with
lovastatin and rolipram rescues learning defects in both adult and larval NF1 mutants.
Rapamycin, which targets the downstream Rheb/mTOR pathway had no effects on learning.
The larval learning system pairing shock and odor provides a rapid (one minute) and robust
protocol that will be useful for screening drugs and novel compounds that can advance to be
tested in mouse models and eventual clinical trials in humans.

PROGRESS IN MANAGEMENT OF NF1 BONE ABNORMALITIES

Both focal and localized bone abnormalities are part of the phenotypic expression of NF1,
but the natural history and pathogenesis of the various skeletal abnormalities are not well
delineated. However, over the past decade significant progress has been made in
understanding the effects of aberrant Ras signaling on bone. In 2008, the Children’s Tumor
Foundation (CTF) convened an International NF1 Bone Abnormalities Consortium to
develop consensus on the clinical management of NF1 skeletal manifestations and forge
collaborations for preclinical and clinical bone studies [Elefteriou et al., 2009]. A session of
the 2009 NF Conference chaired by David Stevenson (University of Utah) highlighted
progress made since that meeting detailing salient clinical and molecular findings which will
be important in developing better management guidelines and future therapeutic
development.

David Feldman (New York University Langone Medical Center) reviewed dural ectasia in
NF1, which is otherwise seen in relatively few other disorders and whose etiology is still
unknown. It was hypothesized that in the context of NF1, dural ectasia is a mesodermal
dysplasia with progressive osseous erosion rather than a focal expansion. The hypothesis of
fluid pressure leading to dural ectasia in NF1 was thought to be unlikely.

Janet Hock (Maine Institute of Genetics and Health) reported on osteoporosis in NF1. The
definition of osteoporosis in the general population, particularly in children, is evolving.
Low bone density, a surrogate measure of bone fragility, appears to be detected at a much
earlier age in NF1, and long before the more common post-menopausal osteoporosis and
elderly male osteoporosis. Although decreased bone mineral density has been reported in
NF1, bone quality and fracture risk are still not well understood in NF1 patients particularly
when accounting for different age ranges. Dr. Hock stated that currently until clinical trial
data become available on osteoporosis in NF1, standard of care guidelines and the use of

regulatory-approved drugs for low bone density and fractures should typically follow the
guidelines approved for osteoporosis in the general population.

David Viskochil (University of Utah) reported on a multicenter study investigating the
spinal abnormalities of prepubertal NF1 children without scoliosis clinically. Approximately
half of the individuals had at least one spine abnormality (31% had vertebral abnormalities
and 17% had dural ectasia). This emphasizes the need for close follow up and detailed
clinical evaluation of the back in a bending position in order to screen for individuals with
potential spinal abnormalities.

Florent Elefteriou (Vanderbilt University) described a conditional mouse model that
recapitulates many of the skeletal findings of NF1 including scoliosis, pectus deformities,
and long bone bowing. The bone quality was poor with dramatic cortical porosity.

Juha Peltonen (University of Turku) reported on the biology of NF1 osteoclasts in vivo and
in vitro. The osteoclast progenitors had an increased survival rate compared to controls with
resistance to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation. Dr. Peltonen concluded that
even when isolated from the factors mediated by other cell types of the NF1
microenvironment, NF1 osteoclasts display an altered phenotype.

Weixi Wang (Vanderbilt University), a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr.
Elefteriou, described results of the use of local delivery of low dose lovastatin via
microparticles in a fracture model using the wild type and Nf1 ob1−/− mouse. There was an
improvement in the biomechanical properties of the calluses in the treated Nf1 ob−/− mouse
compared to the untreated mice, suggesting that local delivery of low dose Lovastatin may
be a consideration for use in future clinical trials.

Aaron Schindeler (Children’s Hospital, University of Sydney) has modeled double
inactivation of NF1 in mice in hopes of creating regionalized double inactivation of NF1
analogous to what has been described in some pseudarthrosis tissue in humans. This would
potentially generate a mouse phenotype more consistent with the clinical human phenotype.

In summary, skeletal abnormalities are a significant part of the NF1 phenotype. This session
demonstrated that though the pathophysiology of the skeletal abnormalities is still not well
defined there has been rapid progress in understanding the biology, developing preclinical
models, and in elucidating the clinical phenotype and natural history of NF1 skeletal
manifestations. An important reference on this area is provided by the publication of the
recent consensus report [Elefteriou et al., 2009] from the NF1 Bone Consortium, a working
group assembled following the Children’s Tumor Foundation Bone Workshop held in early
2008.

NF CLINICAL CASES THAT TAUGHT ME SOMETHING NEW

In the field of neurofibromatosis there exists a symbiotic relationship between scientist
clinician and patient. In recent years clinical sessions have gained a prominent educational
role in the NF Conference demonstrating how scientific findings relate to clinical practice
and impact on patient care. Rosalie Ferner (Guys and St. Thomas’s NHS Trust) and Kathryn
North led a session where expert clinicians presented epidemiological data and case histories
of individuals with NF1 and NF2 to illustrate lessons they had learnt from patients, research
and from clinical experience. An interactive ‘quiz’ with teams from Europe and the United
States as well as audience participation demonstrated unusual clinical presentations and
disease complications of NF1 and NF2.

Gareth Evans (St. Mary’s Hospital, University of Manchester) highlighted the importance of
knowing the frequency of NF1 and NF2 in order to plan for allocation of resources. The
recent results from a Genetic Register Study in North West England are in line with previous
studies: a birth incidence of 1 in 2,699 for NF1 and 1 in 33,000 for NF2; disease prevalence
of 1 in 4,560 (NF1) and 1 in 56,162 (NF2); new mutations in 42% of NF1 and 56% of NF2
individuals. Eric Legius (University of Leuven) emphasized that patients presenting with
ring chromosome 22 (severe cognitive and behavioral impairment, café-au-lait patches and
facial dysmorphism) can develop NF2- related tumors and should be monitored for
vestibular schwannomas from adolescence onwards. Several experts stressed the importance
of meticulous attention to the patient’s clinical history, examination and investigations.
Pitfalls await those who rely solely on clinical protocols and pattern recognition to diagnose
neurocutaneous disease. Misinterpretation of symptoms can lead to over- or under-
diagnosis [Brems et al., 2007; Denayer et al., 2008].

Rosalie Ferner (Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust) explained that a rapidly growing, painful
swelling behind the knee in an NF1 patient with a large plexiform neurofibroma was thought
to arise from a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor but subsequent investigation
revealed a benign Baker’s cyst. Robert Listernick (Northwestern University) described an
adolescent male with NF1 with nocturnal calf pain, and mild weakness of hip flexion and
extension. These problems raised the suspicion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
but no relevant palpable mass was detected and the neurofibromas on neuroimaging were
not relevant to his symptoms. The patient’s mother worked for a vascular surgeon and
recognized the signs as claudication. The patient was diagnosed with an occlusion of the
superficial femoral artery due to NF1 vasculopathy. Susan Huson pointed out that NF2 in
children is a severe disease and frequently under-recognized and misdiagnosed as NF1. She
reported a labial plexiform tumor as an unusual early NF2 manifestation and with Kathryn
North she noted that proptosis and visual impairment in young children with café-au-lait
patches can be due to NF2 rather than NF1. Neuroimaging was the key in Kathryn North’s
patient and revealed bilateral vestibular schwannomas as well as a meningioma surrounding
the normal sized nerve, unlike the optic nerve enlargement in NF1 gliomas.

Bruce Korf (University of Alabama at Birmingham) drew attention to indolent optic
pathway gliomas as potential manifestation of mosaic NF1 and showed the importance of
detailed molecular analysis to confirm the clinical findings. He presented a young man with
an optic pathway glioma and reduced vision detected as an incidental finding when
neuroimaging was performed following head trauma. Careful clinical assessment revealed a
few skin papules, a patch of hyperpigmentation and freckling on one limb. Mutation testing
confirmed NF1 mosaicism and skin biopsy showed a compound melanocytic naevus. David
Viskochil (University of Utah) focused on the dignity, joie de vivre and emotional fortitude
of a young woman in the presence of multiple disease complications from NF1. She had to
deal with learning problems, anorexia nervosa, gastrointestinal symptoms due to a gastro-
intestinal stromal tumor and an inoperable cervical plexiform tumor that was treated with
radiotherapy. He illustrated the devastating consequences of inappropriate administration of
radiotherapy to individuals with NF1 as benign plexiform neurofibroma underwent
untreatable malignant transformation following radiotherapy.

Vincent Riccardi (The Neurofibromatosis Institute) underlined the importance of divergent
thinking in NF1 by showing an adult male with a large plexiform neurofibroma on the back
associated with hypopigmentation. His job as a truck mechanic contributed to the growth of
the plexiform neurofibroma due to repeated trauma from lying on his back. David Gutmann
(Washington University) focused on a common complaint as the manifestation of an
uncommon diagnosis – facial itching was indicative of an underlying brainstem tumor in a
young male with NF1. Rosalie Ferner pointed out that although malignant transformation is

usually associated with plexiform neurofibromas and is rare in schwannomas, it should be
suspected in patients with rapidly enlarging, hard painful lesions.

The session highlighted that advances in molecular biology and neuroimaging have proven
beneficial in aiding diagnosis and management of NF patients. However, the role of clinical
experience, clinical acumen, lateral thinking and above all listening to patients and their
families cannot be underestimated.

NF1 IN CONTEXT – A VIEW FROM RAS/MAPK DISORDERS

Katherine Rauen (University of California, San Francisco) chaired this session which
brought NF1 into context of other genetic syndromes related to NF1. NF1 belongs to a class
of genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes which encode components of
the Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This pathway plays an essential
role in the control of the cell cycle and differentiation; therefore its dysregulation has
profound developmental consequences. These “RASopathies” each exhibit unique
phenotypic features; however, many share characteristic overlapping features including
craniofacial dysmorphology, cardiac malformations and cutaneous, musculoskeletal and
ocular abnormalities, varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment and, in some
syndromes, an increased risk of developing cancer [Tidyman and Rauen, 2009]. In this
session, several RASopathies were discussed which demonstrated that there exists similar
developmental phenotypes among this group of genetic syndromes.

Ludwine Messiaen (University of Alabama at Birmingham), Meena Upadhyaya (Cardiff
University) and Eric Legius (University of Leuven) discussed Legius syndrome, a recently
identified autosomal dominant disorder which shares many phenotypic features with NF1.
Individuals with Legius syndrome may present with café-au-lait maculae, freckling, mild
neurocognitive impairment and macrocephaly with some having a Noonan-like facies.
However, in Legius syndrome, features such as neurofibromas, iris Lisch nodules and
central nervous system tumors - commonly seen in NF1 - are lacking. Legius syndrome is
caused by mutations in SPRED1 resulting in haploinsufficiency of the protein SPRED1, a
member of the SPROUTY/SPRED proteins family. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of Ras
and acts by inhibiting Raf phosphorylation. Heterogenous SPRED1 mutations associated
with Legius syndrome cause truncation of the protein resulting in a loss of SPRED1 function
thereby increasing signaling down the Ras/MAPK pathway. Dr. Messiaen and colleagues
performed SPRED1 mutation analysis in 1318 unrelated patients with the clinical diagnosis
of NF1 and in whom no NF1 mutations had been identified. In this cohort, they identified 34
different SPRED1 mutations in 43 probands: twenty seven were pathogenic (including 2
missense mutations) and 7 missense mutations were classified as probably benign. They
estimated that 1.2–2.9% of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of NF1 have Legius
syndrome.

Dr. Upadhyaya and colleagues set out to ascertain the frequency of SPRED1 mutations in
individuals with an NF1 phenotype by examining 85 unrelated mildly affected NF1 patients
known to be negative for NF1. A subset of these patients negative for NF1 and SPRED1
were subsequently screened for mutations of the related SPRED2–3 and SPRY1–4 genes to
determine whether mutations in other SPRED/SPRY genes were causal in these patients.
SPRED1 mutations were identified in 7 unrelated patients. A potential sequence alteration of
the SPRY1 gene was identified in one patient but further analysis is required to evaluate its
pathogenicity.

Dr. Legius and colleagues examined the cognitive abilities in Legius syndrome. They
investigated a group of 9 children with a SPRED1 mutation and compared IQ test scores
with 7 siblings. The mean performal IQ score in the SPRED1 group was 15 IQ points lower

compared to the sibling group with lower scores than sibs also identified in additional
developmental testing. In addition, analysis of cognition in Spred1 knockout mice showed a
significantly slower learning in hippocampus dependent tests such as the hidden Morris
Water Maze and the T-maze. These findings correlated with a decreased long term
potentiation in hippocampal slices and an increased long term depression in Spred1
knockout mice. Biochemical analysis corroborated this finding by increased ERK
phosphorylation. They are further investigating if the cognitive defects in Spred1 mice can
be rescued by treatment with statins. Cognitive defects are present in humans and mice with
a SPRED1 mutation but are generally milder than in the NF1 group.

Miikka Vikkula (Université catholique de Louvain) discussed capillary malformation-
arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM), which is an autosomal dominant
inherited disorder characterized by multifocal capillary malformations which may be
associated with arteriovenous malformations and fistulas [Eeerol et al., 2003; Revencu et al.,
2008]. CM-AVM syndrome is caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in the gene
RASA1, which like NF1, encodes a RasGAP. The hallmark of this syndrome is the
multifocality of the malformations. AVMs can occur in many tissues including skin, muscle,
bone, and in various internal organs including the brain. In addition, RASA1 mutations have
been associated with individuals diagnosed with Parkes-Weber syndrome and vein of Galen
malformations. Haploinsufficiency of p120-RasGAP, the protein product of RASA1, causes
a reduction in the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP and, therefore, increases Ras/MAPK pathway
signaling. Interestingly, CM-AVM patients may be at increased risk of developing tumors.

Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with prevalence in the
population similar in frequency to NF1. NS, which was discussed by Amy Roberts
(Children’s Hospital Boston), is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, short
stature, congenital cardiac anomalies, bleeding disorders and a variable degree
neurocognitive delay. Individuals with NS have an increased risk of cancer. At present four
genes, PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1 and RAF1 harboring heterozygous germline mutations cause
NS with all genes encoding various components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. However, there
are still more genes to be identified. The most common gene associated with NS is PTPN11
which accounts for approximately half of all cases.

Katherine Rauen discussed Costello syndrome (CS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome
(CFC), two other syndromes that are part of the Ras/MAPK pathway. CS is a rare
developmental disorder with multiple anomalies, including characteristic dysmorphic
craniofacial features, failure to thrive, cardiac, musculoskeletal and ectodermal
abnormalities and neurocognitive delay. Individuals with CS are at increased risk of
developing neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Heterozygous germline mutations in
HRAS cause CS. The distribution frequency of mutations reveals that more than 80% of
individuals have a G12S substitution, followed by the second most common, G12A. CFC,
like CS, is rare, and shares many overlapping phenotypic features with NS and CS, and to
some extent with NF1. CFC individuals have a Noonan-like facies, cardiac malformations,
ectodermal, gastrointestinal, ocular and musculoskeletal abnormalities, with most having
short stature. Neurologic abnormalities are universally present to varying degrees and
include hypotonia, motor delay, speech delay and/or learning disability. Three genes that
encode proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway downstream of Ras, have been associated with
CFC syndrome: BRAF, MAP2K1 (MEK1) and MAP2K2 (MEK2).

Michelle Strecker (University of California, San Francisco) described a new and novel clinic
at UCSF where she is the clinic coordinator: the NF/Ras Pathway Clinic. This was adapted
from the Children’s Tumor Foundation’s structure for the national NF Clinic Network. This

KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS: NEW PERSPECTIVES

Conference highlights included three keynote presentations from David Kwiatkowski
(Harvard Medical School) on tuberous sclerosis; Allan Balmain (University of California,
San Francisco) on the ‘multiple faces of Ras’; and Luis Parada (University of Texas, South
Western) who also honored as the 2009 recipient of the Friedrich Von Recklinghausen
Award, which is given annually by the Children’s Tumor Foundation to recognize
individuals making outstanding contributions to NF research and clinical care.

Allan Balmain discussed the tissue-specific expression and mutation of Ras family
members, the effect of germline mouse strain polymorphisms on preferential expression and
mutation of specific parental Ras alleles. He also discussed amplification of mutant or loss
of wild type Ras alleles late in tumorigenesis, and identification of other genes involved in
tumor resistance of certain mouse strains. Data from his laboratory over the past 3 years
implicate K-Ras4A oncogenic mutation in regulating cell fate decisions initiating, but not
necessary for maintaining, lung tumorigenesis. A requirement for the 4A isoform of K-Ras
may be linked to the farnesylation motif at its carboxy terminus, specifying subcellular
localization. Using mouse strains susceptible or resistant to lung tumorigenesis, his group
found that increased expression of K-Ras2, controlled by a cis-acting quantitative trait locus,
itself controls tumor susceptibility. The balance between expression levels of wild type and
mutant KRas alleles controls progression of lung cancer, consistent with wild type Ras
blocking effects of oncogenic Ras proteins, and with selection for loss of wild type Ras
alleles in tumorigenesis. New work using bioinformatic methods is revealing pathways
modulating regulation of the Ras pathway at defined stages of tumorigenesis that may be
useful in categorizing human tumors.

David Kwiatkowski presented on the tuberous sclerosis signaling hub and its broader role in
neural development and cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor
syndrome, with many similarities to but also many differences from NF1. The protein
products of the genes which cause TSC are TSC1 and TSC2, and these are at the central hub
of a signaling pathway that extends through the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways to TSC1/
TSC2 to regulate activation of mTORC1. The TSC1/TSC2 proteins play a particularly
important role in brain development, reflected by the neuropathology and neurological
manifestations. Although in general these genes are not common targets for mutation/
inactivation in human cancer, there are some tumors in which they seem to be an important
target.

The 2009 recipient of the Friedrich von Recklinghausen Award, Luis Parada presented on “a
decade of modeling NF1 in the mouse”. Plexiform neurofibromas are embryonic in origin,
are at least 15%–25% penetrant and can progress to malignancy suggesting they have a
different cell of origin than do dermal neurofibromas which are 100% penetrant, have later
onset and are not pre-disposed to malignancy. Studies in human tumors suggest that only the
Schwann cell lineage needs to undergo loss of heterozygosity for tumors to develop but do
not provide a timeline for the progression of tumors. Mice lacking NF1 in Schwann cell
precursors develop neurofibromas but do not develop neurofibromas in a wild type cell
environment – i.e. neurofibromas only develop on an NF1+/− background. In 2008, Parada
and colleagues uncovered a genetic contribution of the environment to tumor formation,
likely attributable to the mast cell. In mouse, mast cells degranulate prior to the development
of tumors suggesting an inflammatory response precedes tumor development. In the Nf1+/−
mouse with a selective knock-out of NF1 in Schwann cells (−/−) neurofibromas develop.

However, following a bone marrow transplant to ensure development of +/+ mast cells, no
tumors develop. Thus, +/− mast cells interact with Schwann cells that have loss of
heterozygosity to lead to the development of neurofibromas. Mast cells require the cKIT
receptor for development and function. This is inhibited by Imatinib. Treatment with
Imatinib has been demonstrated to lead to shrinkage of plexiform neurofibroma in one case.
A Phase II trial currently underway suggests further efficacy. In 2009, Parada and colleagues
propose that dermal neurofibromas arise from dermal stem cell progenitors. Dermal tumors
have the same cellular composition as plexiform neurofibromas but have limited growth
potential. The dermal stem cell progenitors (SKPs) have neural crest like properties and
development of neurofibromas appears to depend on the microenvironment. The Parada
group is now studying the origin of these cells in quail/chick chimeras. They have also noted
the high frequency of mutations in NF1 in sporadic malignant gliomas.
