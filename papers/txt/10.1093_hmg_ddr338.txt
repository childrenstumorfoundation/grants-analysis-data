Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a commonly inherited disorder mostly caused by
mutations in PKD1, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1). The disease is characterized by development and growth of
epithelium-lined cyst in both kidneys, often leading to renal failure. There is no speciﬁc treatment for this dis-
ease. Here, we report a sustained activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of tran-
scription 3 (STAT3) in ischemic injured and uninjured Pkd1 knockout polycystic kidneys and in human
ADPKD kidneys. Through a chemical library screen, we identiﬁed the anti-parasitic compound pyrimethamine
as an inhibitor of STAT3 function. Treatment with pyrimethamine decreases cell proliferation in human
ADPKD cells and blocks renal cyst formation in an adult and a neonatal PKD mouse model. Moreover, we
demonstrated that a speciﬁc STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, reduces cyst formation and growth in a neonatal
PKD mouse model. Our results suggest that PC1 acts as a negative regulator of STAT3 and that blocking
STAT3 signaling with pyrimethamine or similar drugs may be an attractive therapy for human ADPKD.

INTRODUCTION

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a
commonly inherited disorder characterized by increased pro-
liferation of epithelial cells and gradual
replacement of
normal renal parenchyma by ﬂuid-ﬁlled cysts with ultimate
loss of renal function. About half of the patients require
organ transplantation (1,2). Mutations
in PKD1, which
encodes polycystin-1 (PC1), are responsible for 85% of
ADPKD cases.

We and other groups have previously generated Pkd1 indu-
cible knockout (IKO) mice and showed that Pkd1 inactivation
in the developing kidney results in rapid cyst formation (3 – 5),
whereas loss of Pkd1 in adult kidney induces only slow focal
cyst formation. In contrast to the developing kidney, the adult
kidney epithelia are terminally differentiated and proliferate at
a very low rate. It is noteworthy that similar to kidney devel-
opment, PC1 expression is high during late embryogenesis and
the ﬁrst 2 weeks after birth. Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI),
which reactivates a renal developmental program and triggers
epithelial cell proliferation (6), causes massive cystic lesions
in these mice (7). We therefore hypothesized that PC1 may

act as a regulator of developmental signaling pathways and
cell proliferation. Most studies on ADPKD orthologous
models were performed on immature kidneys. Whether the
molecular mechanisms underlying cyst
formation in the
mature kidney are the same as in the developing kidney is
unknown.

The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion (JAK/STAT) pathway is critical for developmental regula-
tion, growth control and homeostasis in organs (8 – 12).
Phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 occurs in response
to a variety of cytokines and growth factors including
interleukin-6 (IL-6), epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte
growth factor (13,14). The expression of these cytokine and
growth factors is associated with PKD progression (15 – 17).
Interestingly, ciliary neurotrophic factor-induced phosphoryl-
ation at serine 727 of STAT3 is reported to be mediated by
the mTOR pathway (18), which is also up-regulated in both
ADPKD kidneys (19) and ischemic injured rat kidneys (20).
Constitutively activated STAT3 and the overexpression of its
downstream target gene cyclin D1 are seen in many solid
tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(21) and renal cell carcinoma (22,23). The relationship

between STAT3-mediated signaling pathway and ADPKD,
however, is not clear. After this work was completed, Leonhard
et al. (24) reported that curcumin treatment reduced the elevated
STAT3 and S6 phosphorylation in iKsp-Pkd1del mouse kidneys
and delayed the onset of renal failure by 10 days in this mouse
model. Curcumin, however, has a variety of effects beyond its in-
hibition of STAT3 activity. Whether STAT3 would be an effect-
ive drug target for the treatment of ADPKD remains unknown.
Here, we show that STAT3 is activated in mouse and
human PKD1 disease. The anti-parasitic drug pyrimethamine
and another compound STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, signiﬁcant-
ly inhibit the cyst formation and growth in adult onset PKD
mouse model and neonatal PKD mouse model, respectively.

RESULTS

Pkd1ﬂox/ﬂox

We ﬁrst looked at the activation of STAT3 in cystic kidneys of
1-week-old Col2Cre
knockout
(CKO) mice (25), which is a rapid model for cystogenesis.
These mice develop cysts around birth and die 12 – 14 days
after birth due to severe polycystic kidney disease. In addition
to a PKD phenotype, Col2Cre
Pkd1CKO display a mild re-
duction in the cortical bone deposition and cranial base
defects (25). As expected, the levels of tyrosine phosphory-
lated active STAT3 (pSTAT3) as well as total STAT3
protein signiﬁcantly increased in cystic kidneys in PKD
mouse model, compared with those in littermate control
kidneys (Fig. 1A). To investigate the expression of STAT3-
dependent transcription, we performed real-time reverse tran-
scriptase – polymerase chain reaction (RT – PCR) of cyclin D1,
cyclin D2,
and Bcl-X. Signiﬁcantly increased
steady-state transcript levels of these STAT3 target genes
after normalization with b-actin are evident in these mouse
cystic kidneys (Fig. 1B). In addition, STAT3 mRNA levels
+-
were also signiﬁcantly increased. Since the Col2Cre
Pkd1ﬂox/ﬂox CKO mice die during post-natal development,
we switched to the Mx1Cre
Pkd1 IKO mouse models for
further experiments. The IKO mice survive much longer and
more closely resemble human ADPKD. In addition to an
increased pSTAT3 level, we also observed striking nuclear lo-
calization of pSTAT3 in a subset of cyst-lining epithelial cells
from the Mx1Cre
Pkd1 IKO model (Fig. 1C). No pSTAT3
signal was found in the wild-type kidneys (Fig. 1C). IL-6
was previously found in renal cystic ﬂuid from human

ADPKD patients (16). We found (cid:3)6-fold higher levels of

c-Myc

+

IL-6 in Pkd1 IKO cystic kidneys than their littermate control
kidneys (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possibility that
this
up-regulation of STAT3 activation is unique to the PKD
mouse models, we performed immunoblotting for pSTAT3
on human ADPKD and non-PKD kidneys. Consistent with
our ﬁndings in mouse kidneys, increased pSTAT3 was also
observed in human ADPKD kidneys (Fig. 1E). Moreover,
we detected an increase in pSTAT3 in cyst-lining epithelial
cells derived from a human ADPKD kidney when compared
with cells from a normal (non-PKD) kidney (Fig. 1G). We
also found pSTAT3 in the nuclei of relatively small cyst-lining
epithelial cells in human ADPKD kidneys but not in non-PKD

kidneys by immunostaining (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Ma-
terial, Fig. S1A). Thus, STAT3 activation is up-regulated in
both mouse cystic kidneys and human ADPKD kidney.

Identiﬁcation of pyrimethamine as a STAT3 inhibitor
through a mechanistic-based screen

Recently two human clinical trial studies have shown that
mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus and everolimus, did not signiﬁ-
cantly beneﬁt patients with ADPKD (26 – 28). Furthermore, in-
hibition of mTOR can have signiﬁcant side effects (29). To
discover clinically relevant drugs that would be safe in
humans and potentially effective for
the treatment of
ADPKD, we focused on identifying small molecule inhibitors
of STAT3 transcriptional activity. A cell-based functional
assay was utilized (30), and compounds from the Prestwick
collection, a library of 1120 small molecules biased toward
bioactives and drugs known to be safe in humans, were inter-
rogated for the ability to inhibit STAT3, while having little to
no effect in a counter-screen of nuclear factor k-light-chain-
enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB)-dependent transcription-
al activity. From this screen, the anti-parasitic compound pyri-
methamine was

Pyrimethamine inhibits STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation

To determine whether pyrimethamine reduces STAT3 phos-
phorylation in human ADPKD epithelial cells, conﬂuent
ADPKD cells were cultured in the presence of pyrimethamine
at a range of concentrations for 24 h and analyzed by western
blotting. We found that pyrimethamine signiﬁcantly decreased
pSTAT3 in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the

pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio by (cid:3)33 or (cid:3)72% (50 or 100 mM Py),

without changing the total STAT3 level (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
pyrimethamine only had a modest effect in non-PKD human
epithelial
cell
(RCTEC); Fig. 3B]. Along with the reduction in pSTAT3,
the viability of pyrimethamine-treated ADPKD cells also
decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). To determine
whether
reﬂected
decreased proliferation or increased apoptosis, we assessed
cell proliferation by ﬂow cytometry and apoptosis by DNA
fragmentation assay. We found that there was a signiﬁcant re-
duction in the G2/M phase and an increase in the S phase in
pyrimethamine-treated ADPKD cells (Fig. 3D and Supple-
mentary Material, Table S1), indicating that pyrimethamine
induced an S-phase arrest. DNA ladder
formation was
evident in pyrimethamine-treated cells, indicating an increase
in apoptosis (Fig. 3E). Thus, besides reducing pSTAT3 levels,
pyrimethamine inhibits cell proliferation by blocking cell
cycle progression and inducing programmed cell death in
ADPKD cells.
Importantly, pyrimethamine decreased the
number of viable cells (Fig. 3F), the status of cell cycle
(Fig. 3G) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3H) only at a high
dose in normal RCTEC cells. These data suggest

Figure 2. Pyrimethamine speciﬁcally inhibits STAT3-dependent reporter gene
expression. Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of pyri-
methamine for 1 h prior to cytokine stimulation as described in Materials
and methods.

pyrimethamine preferentially affects the ADPKD cells and is
an attractive candidate for ADPKD treatment.

STAT3 is known to be activated by cytokine receptors
(through phosphorylation by Jak family kinases) and growth
factor receptors (13). To determine whether this increased
STAT3 activation in ADPKD cells is mediated by an upstream
Jak family member, the cells were treated with nifuroxazide,
which inhibits Jak2 activity and in turn decreases STAT3
phosphorylation (30). Similar to pyrimethamine, nifuroxazide

also reduced pSTAT3 in a dose-dependent manner, by (cid:3)40 or
84% (50 or 100 mM Nif; Fig. 3I). Furthermore, another well-
characterized Jak2 inhibitor, Jak inhibitor 1, dramatically
reduced pSTAT3 in ADPKD cells (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S1B). Thus, activation of STAT3 in ADPKD cells is
due to increased Jak2 activity. Since Jak2 also activates
STAT1 in addition to STAT3, we immunoblotted pSTAT1
in pyrimethamine-treated ADPKD cells. Interestingly, pyri-
methamine did not

reported that a dose of 60 mg/kg, which corresponds to a
plasma pyrimethamine concentration of 320 mmol/l
(32),
achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in human melanoma growth
in a severe combined immunodeﬁciency mouse model but a
lower dose of pyrimethamine (6 mg/kg) does not (33). There-
fore, we chose the dose of 25 mg/kg in this study. As expected,

reduced in drug-treated aIKO injured kidneys (Fig. 4Bc). Mor-
phometric analyses revealed that drug-treated aIKO mice have
signiﬁcantly reduced kidney weight, kidney/body weight ratio
and cyst number without signiﬁcant weight loss or other signs
of toxicity, compared with vehicle-treated aIKO mice (Fig. 4C
and Table 1). To investigate whether pyrimethamine inhibits
cell proliferation in aIKO injured kidneys, we injected
′
5-bromo-2
-deoxyuridine (BrdU) on the 2nd and 3rd days
after bilateral IRI to label proliferating cells and stained
them 4 weeks later. The intensity of BrdU in Dolichos biﬂorus
agglutinin (DBA) positive tubular epithelial cells in drug-
treated aIKO injured kidneys and vehicle-treated littermate
control
injured kidneys were similar, suggesting similar
rounds of cell divisions (Fig. 4Bd and f); however, it was
much stronger
in vehicle-treated Pkd1 aIKO
injured kidneys (Fig. 4Be and f). This indicates that the drug-
treated Pkd1 aIKO tubular epithelial cells have regained a
normal cellular proliferation response. On the other hand, a di-
lution of BrdU seen in vehicle-treated aIKO injured kidneys
(Fig. 4Be) indicates continuous multiple rounds of cell prolif-
eration, consistent with our previous study (7). Thus, pyri-

cance (P ¼ 0.051; Fig. 3E). In summary, pyrimethamine has

Pyrimethamine suppresses cyst formation and growth
in Pkd1 IKO kidneys

We have previously shown that renal IRI accelerates cyst for-
mation in mice with Pkd1 inactivation induced in adulthood
(7). To investigate whether pyrimethamine has a beneﬁcial
effect on cystogenesis in this adult PKD mouse model
(aIKO), we ﬁrst immunoblotted pSTAT3 in kidney lysates
from aIKO and their littermate wild-type mice at 48 h and 1
week after IRI. Increased STAT3 activation was observed in
both wild-type and aIKO injured kidneys at 48 h after IRI
when the cell proliferation in the injured kidney reaches a
peak (7,31), compared with contralateral
(non-ischemic)
kidneys (Fig. 4A). One week after IRI, as the kidney recovers,
the levels of pSTAT3 in control injured kidneys decreased to a
level similar to contralateral (non-ischemic) kidneys. In con-
trast, pSTAT3 levels failed to decline at 1 week after IRI in
aIKO injured kidneys (Fig. 4A), coinciding with the extensive
cell proliferation seen in those kidneys (7). Thus, we

a beneﬁcial effect on cystogenesis and is an excellent candi-
date of possible intervention for human ADPKD.

S3I-201 suppresses cyst formation and growth in Pkd1
IKO kidneys

To further verify the importance of STAT3 signaling in PKD,
we administered nIKO mice with a chemical
inhibitor of
STAT3 activity, S3I-201 (NSC 74859; 10 mg/kg) or vehicle
beginning at 3 weeks of age for 5 weeks. S3I-201 is known
to inhibit STAT3 homodimer complex formation and
STAT3 DNA-binding and transcriptional activities (34). In
contrast to the rapid widespread cyst formation in the vehicle-
treated group, the S3I-201-treated group displayed no body
weight
loss but had signiﬁcantly reduced cystogenesis,
shown by signiﬁcantly reduced kidney weight, kidney/body
weight ratio, cyst volume, cyst number and serum creatinine
(Fig. 5A and B, Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A and
Table 2). Pathological ﬁndings seen in H&E-stained kidney

epithelial cells and interstitial cells in drug-treated mouse
kidneys (Fig. 5D). Moreover,
the mRNA expression of
STAT3 target genes in S3I-201-treated nIKO kidneys was sig-
niﬁcantly reduced, compared with vehicle-treated nIKO
kidneys, and was similar to un-treated wild-type kidneys
(Fig. 5E). S3I-201 is also effective in suppressing STAT3 ac-
tivation in human ADPKD cells (Fig. 5F). Similar
to
pyrimethamine-treated ADPKD cells,
S3I-201-treated
ADPKD cells exhibited reduction in G2/M phase and increase
in S phase (Fig. 5G and Supplementary Material, Table S1).
We also treated nIKO mice with pyrimethamine (12.5 mg/
kg). As expected, pyrimethamine dramatically reduced cysto-
genesis (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A). These data
suggest that blocking STAT3 signaling represents a novel ap-
proach to reduce cystogenesis in human ADPKD.

DISCUSSION

We have recently proposed the ‘third-hit’ hypothesis for
ADPKD in adult life (3) and demonstrated that renal injury
acts as a ‘third-hit’ and facilitates rapid cyst development in
mice with adult
inactivation of Pkd1 (7). Subsequently,
Happe et al. (35) reported that dichlorovinyl cysteine-induced
renal injury also accelerates cyst formation in adult Pkd1 IKO
mice. Consistent with these ﬁndings in mice, a recent human
study has demonstrated that
two renal allograft recipient
patients developed polycystic kidney disease in the donor
kidney a few months after kidney transplantation, although
the donor patient carried a PKD1 mutation and did not have
cysts for 30 years (28). These data suggest that ischemia
experienced during the surgery accelerates cyst formation in
humans, further supporting the relevance of our adult PKD
IKO mouse model to the human condition. In this study, we
have tested a possible intervention for ADPKD in both adult
and neonatal orthologous mouse models of human ADPKD.

We observed sustained pSTAT3 expression in Pkd1 IKO
injured kidneys 1 week after IRI, when it was decreased in
wild-type injured kidneys. It has been reported that cell prolif-
eration peaks 48 h after IRI and reverts to the baseline 1 week
later. These data indicate that STAT3 activation may be neces-
sary for injury-induced cell proliferation of surviving tubular
cells, yet STAT3 needs to be inactivated to turn off this pro-
liferation when the repair phase is complete. Together, these
data suggest that PC1 negatively regulates STAT3 activation,
either directly or indirectly. Because the increased STAT3 ac-
tivation was also found in non-injury-induced mouse cystic
kidneys and human ADPKD kidneys, it is likely that STAT3
activation is, at least partially, required for the initiation and
maintenance of cyst formation and growth. Interventions

targeted to the STAT3 pathway may offer considerable thera-
peutic beneﬁt for patients with ADPKD.

transcription at doses lower

To accelerate the clinical translation of a STAT3 inhibitor,
we screened a library of compounds already known to be safe
in humans. We identiﬁed pyrimethamine as an inhibitor of
STAT3 function. Pyrimethamine inhibits the activating tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT3. However, since it also inhibits
STAT3-dependent
than that
needed for the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in cancer
cell lines, it likely has additional effects as well. Increasing evi-
dence suggests that STAT1 mediates apoptosis, necrosis and
autophagy. STAT3 regulates cell proliferation through modu-
lating cell cycle progression and cell survival through anti-
apoptotic signaling. Therefore, pyrimethamine-induced cell
death and cell growth arrest may be the combined effects of
up-regulation of STAT1 activity and down-regulation of
STAT3 activity. Pyrimethamine is known as an inhibitor of
the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Another DHFR
inhibitor methotrexate (36) and S3I-201 as well as Jak2 inhibitor

Therefore,
pyrimethamine-induced S-phase arrest may be due to inactiva-
tion of either DHFR or STAT3 or both.

this beneﬁcial effect

Because human ADPKD is usually an adult-onset condition
and there is no established treatment for this disease, we uti-
lized an adult-onset PKD mouse model, which is more rele-
vant to the human ADPKD condition than neonatal models,
for testing the effectiveness of an FDA-approved drug. To
strengthen our data implicating STAT3 signaling as an attract-
ive target for human ADPKD and to exclude the possibility
that
is speciﬁc to injury accelerated
cystic disease, we used an ischemia-independent PKD
mouse model and treated with either pyrimethamine, or
S3I-201, a STAT3-speciﬁc compound that inhibits growth
and induces apoptosis preferentially in tumor cells and in ob-
structive nephropathy (34,38). The effectiveness of S3I-201
and pyrimethamine in reducing cyst formation and growth in
non-ischemia injury-induced neonatal PKD mouse model pro-
vides further support for STAT3 as a therapeutic target in
ADPKD. Since our previous studies (3) did not show any
gender difference in the severity of cystic disease in our
mouse models, we analyzed both male and female mice to
minimize the litter number of lab animals for this study.
However, it would be interesting to investigate whether the
gender-based differences affect the effectiveness of pyrimeth-
amine and S3I-201 in reducing cystogenesis.

It has been shown that PKD1 overexpression causes STAT1
activation and that activated STAT1 is absent from whole
embryo extracts of Pkd1 null mice (39). However, Stat12/2
mice do not have the cystic kidney phenotype (40,41).
PC1-mediated STAT1 activation likely has other functions,

In summary, our results demonstrate that pyrimethamine
and S3I-201 reduce cyst formation and growth in vivo. Inter-
ventions targeting STAT3, such as the clinically relevant
drug pyrimethamine, could be of considerable therapeutic
beneﬁt to patients with ADPKD.

Induction of Cre expression

Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 62.5 or 250 mg of
the IFN inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pI:pC;
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 5 consecutive days
at 1 week of age for a neonatal IKO mouse model or 5
weeks of age for an adult IKO mouse model, respectively,
to induce the expression of Cre recombinase and inactivate
Pkd1.

Renal IRI model

Studies were performed according to the animal experimental
guidelines issued by the Animal Care and Use Committee at
Harvard University. The Pkd1 IKO and their
littermate
control mice were injected with pI:pC at 5 weeks of age.
IRI was performed at 8 weeks of age. Animals were anesthe-
tized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg body weight, intra-

removed after 20 – 25 min (males) or 30 – 35 min (females).
One milliliter of 0.9% NaCl was administered subcutaneously
2 h after surgery. To label proliferating cells, mice were
injected with BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich)
intraperitoneally
(50 mg/kg body weight) on the 2nd and 3rd days after IRI
and sacriﬁced at 4 weeks after treatment.

Preparation and administration of pyrimethamine
and S3I-201 in mice

Pyrimethamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and administered at 25 mg/kg
of body weight by gavage for 5 consecutive days per week
until analysis. S3I-201 (EMD4Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ,
USA) was dissolved in 20% DMSO and 80% phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and administered intraperitoneally at
10 mg/kg of body weight for 5 consecutive days per week
until analysis.

Cell culture

Human cell lines from RCTE and ADPKD cyst-lining epithe-
lia (9 – 12 cell line) were previously immortalized with recom-
binant ori- adeno-SV40 viruses (44) and were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s media containing 10% fetal
bovine serum.

Generation of reporter cell lines

To identify small molecule inhibitors of STAT3, we performed
a cell-based assay quantitatively measuring STAT3-dependent
reporter gene expression (30). We used the STAT1 null U3A
cell line stably transfected with a STAT3 regulatory element
driving luciferase expression. To eliminate non-speciﬁc inhibi-
tors and generally cytotoxic compounds, we countered screened
using 293 cells containing an NFkB-responsive luciferase gene.
We screened the Prestwick Chemical Library, which contains
1120 bioactive compounds. Cells were plated in opaque

384-well plates at a concentration of 2.5 × 103 cells/well and

allowed to adhere overnight. Compounds dissolved in DMSO
were added to the cells and allowed to incubate for 1 h, after
which cytokine was added [10 ng/ml human IL-6 (Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for STAT3 activation and 10 ng/ml
murine tumor necrosis factor-a for NFkB activation]. The
ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was 0.33%. Six hours later, luci-
ferase activity was quantitated using the Bright-Glo Luciferase
Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) and a Lumi-
noskan Ascent
from Labsystems (Helsinki,
Finland). Conﬁrmation of activity was determined using the

luminometer

same assay, except 1 × 104 cells/well were plated in opaque

96-well plates. The ﬁnal DMSO concentration was 0.1%. To
measure the effect of compounds on STAT5 transcriptional ac-
tivity, a cell line containing a STAT5-responsive luciferase re-
porter gene was used (30). STAT5 was activated by stimulation
with 100 ng/ml of human prolactin (Peptrotech). Pyrimeth-
amine (Sigma-Aldrich) was chosen for further study based on
its activity in the STAT3 assay, and the absence of effects in
the STAT5 and NFkB assays.

Cell cycle analysis

Human ADPKD cells were treated with pyrimethamine at the
indicated concentration for 24 h. Cells were then ﬁxed with
70% ethanol and stored at 48C until ﬂow cytometry analysis.
Fixed cells were stained with 50 mg/ml of propidium iodide
solution containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 and
10 mg/ml of RNase A (guaranteed DNase free).

Measurement of cyst volume

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Murine IL-6 cytokine was measured in kidney lysates accord-
ing to the manufacture’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minne-
apolis, MN, USA) and normalized with protein amount.

The cyst volume was quantiﬁed in whole-kidney H&E stain-
ing sections using Image Pro Plus v5 software (Media Cyber-

netics) and calculated as (cystic area/total kidney area) ×

100%. Two sections from both kidneys were analyzed for
each mouse.

Histology and immunohistochemistry

Real-time RT – PCR

Parafﬁn-embedded sections (4 mm) were dewaxed, rehydrated
through graded alcohols and boiled in 10 mM citrate (pH 6.0;
VECTOR, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min. The sections
were then placed in the staining dish at room temperature
and allowed to cool for 1 h. Sections were incubated with
10% goat serum for 30 min and incubated with either anti-
tyrosine pSTAT3 antibody (1:200; Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA) or anti-BrdU antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After
washing with PBS, sections were incubated with secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. For double staining
with the tubule marker Lectin DBA (VECTOR), a dilution
of 1:500 was used. After washing with PBS, sections were
′
mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4
-6-diami-
dino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Western blotting

Kidneys were homogenized with T-PER (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Rockford, IL, USA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche,
South San Francisco, CA, USA) on ice. Tissue lysates were
cleared by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in radio-immuno-
precipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) containing pro-
tease inhibitors (Roche), and cell lysates were cleared by
centrifugation. Equal amounts of lysates (100 mg) were sepa-
rated on 10 or 12% SDS – PAGE. The proteins were trans-
ferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Woburn,
MA, USA). The membranes were then blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk in PBS for 30 min incubated overnight at
48C with antibody to tyrosine pSTAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signal-
ing), STAT3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) or a-tubulin (1:5000; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA). After three washings with PBS, the membranes
were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; Amer-
sham) for 1 h. Finally,
the blots were developed by the
enhanced chemiluminescence method. Membranes were then
stripped of antibodies using RestoreTM Western Blot Strip-
ping Buffer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) for 30 min at 378C. Mem-
branes were then reprobed with primary antibody and
secondary antibodies.
