SUMMARY

Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor result in deregulated Ras signaling and drive tumor-
igenesis in the familial cancer syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type I. However, the extent to which NF1 inacti-
vation promotes sporadic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we report that NF1 is inactivated in sporadic
gliomas via two mechanisms: excessive proteasomal degradation and genetic loss. NF1 protein destabiliza-
tion is triggered by the hyperactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) and confers sensitivity to PKC inhibitors.
However, complete genetic loss, which only occurs when p53 is inactivated, mediates sensitivity to mTOR
inhibitors. These studies reveal an expanding role for NF1 inactivation in sporadic gliomagenesis and illus-
trate how different mechanisms of inactivation are utilized in genetically distinct tumors, which consequently
impacts therapeutic sensitivity.

SIGNIFICANCE

Tumor suppressors are often mutated in human cancer; however, the excessive proteasomal destruction of tumor
suppressor proteins also promotes tumorigenesis. Here we show that the NF1 protein is destabilized in sporadic glioblas-
tomas (GBMs) as a consequence of the hyperactivation of PKC. Notably, this destabilization confers sensitivity to PKC
inhibitors. In contrast, a separate subset of GBMs that possess NF1 mutations are insensitive to PKC inhibitors but are
sensitive to mTOR inhibitors. These ﬁndings reveal a broad role for NF1 inactivation in gliomagenesis and illustrate how
different mechanisms of inactivation are utilized in the same tumor type. Moreover, they highlight the importance of eluci-
dating the molecular mechanisms that underlie tumorigenesis, as such knowledge may be essential for developing person-
alized therapies.

INTRODUCTION

The Ras pathway is commonly deregulated in human cancer
(Downward, 2003). Genetic alterations can occur in Ras genes,
upstream regulators, or downstream effectors. One such regu-
lator is the NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes a Ras-GTPase
activating protein (RasGAP), referred to as neuroﬁbromin (Martin
et al., 1990; Xu et al., 1990). Accordingly, NF1 inactivation triggers
the aberrant activation of the Ras pathway, and loss-of-function
mutations in NF1 underlie the familial cancer syndrome neuroﬁ-
bromatosis type I (NF1) (Basu et al., 1992; DeClue et al., 1992).
NF1 patients develop a diverse set of tumor types, including
benign neuroﬁbromas, malignant sarcomas, gliomas, pheochro-
mocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal
tumors, and myeloid
leukemia (Riccardi, 1992). However, whereas neuroﬁbromin criti-
cally regulates Ras in many tissues, it is unknown whether NF1
inactivation plays a major role in the development of sporadic
tumors. NF1 mutations and genomic alterations have been
reported in isolated tumor samples and cell lines of various origins
(Andersen et al., 1993; Li et al., 1992; The et al., 1993; Thiel et al.,
1995). More recently, heterozygous mutations in NF1 were
observed in larger panels of glioblastomas (Parsons et al., 2008;
TCGA Research Network, 2008); however, homozygous muta-
tions were found to be relatively rare (TCGA Research Network,
2008). Thus, our understanding of how NF1 inactivation may
contribute to sporadic tumor development still needs to be reﬁned.
Tumor suppressors are often mutated in human cancer;
however, precocious proteasomal degradation of several prom-
inent tumor suppressors, including p53, PTEN, and p27, also
contributes to their functional inactivation (Honda et al., 1997;
Pagano et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2007). Notably, neuroﬁbromin
has been shown to be a direct target of the ubiquitin-proteasome

pathway, and its regulated inactivation promotes proliferation in
response to growth factors (Cichowski et al., 2003). Therefore, in
this study, we sought to identify the signals that trigger neuroﬁ-
bromin degradation and determine whether its destabilization
might also play a role in sporadic tumorigenesis.

RESULTS

PKC Activation Is Necessary and Sufﬁcient to Induce
Neuroﬁbromin Degradation
We have shown that serum and growth factors trigger the rapid
ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction of neuroﬁbromin in
many cell types (Cichowski et al., 2003). Accordingly, the speciﬁc
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib blocks the acute degradation of
neuroﬁbromin in NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 1A). Antibodies recog-
nizing distant regions of the protein conﬁrm that neuroﬁbromin
is completely degraded and that the loss of immunoreactivity is
not due to the masking of a speciﬁc epitope after stimulation
(Figures 1A and 1B). Notably, neuroﬁbromin is a direct and sensi-
tive target of the ubiquitination machinery, which can be visual-
ized by the accumulation of high-mobility ubiquitinated species
both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 1C and 2A; Cichowski et al.,
2003). These observations highlight the dynamic and exquisite
regulation of neuroﬁbromin by the proteasome.

Previous studies suggest that neuroﬁbromin degradation is
necessary for maximal Ras activation triggered by growth factors
and that its reexpression is required for the appropriate attenua-
tion of this signal (Cichowski et al., 2003). However, whereas
growth factors trigger neuroﬁbromin destruction, nothing is
known about the speciﬁc signals that mediate this effect. To inter-
rogate the role of individual signaling cascades in this process,
NIH 3T3 cells were exposed to pharmacological
inhibitors of

NF1 Inactivation in Gliomagenesis

et al., 1990; Marais et al., 1998). To determine whether neuroﬁ-
bromin degradation mediates this effect, we utilized a degrada-
tion-resistant fragment of neurofibromin (DRNF1) that is resistant
to ubiquitin-mediated degradation in vitro (Cichowski et al.,
2003). Whereas endogenous neuroﬁbromin was degraded by
PMA in vivo, DRNF1 was not (Figure 2A). Importantly, DRNF1
attenuated Ras activation, indicating that neuroﬁbromin must
be degraded to permit normal levels of Ras activity (Figure 2B).
In addition, a mutation that impaired RasGAP catalytic activity
was impaired in its ability to suppress Ras-GTP levels (Figure S2).
Conversely, inactivation of neuroﬁbromin via RNAi was sufﬁcient
to activate Ras in the absence of PMA under these conditions
(Figure 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that PKC-
driven degradation of neuroﬁbromin is an important Ras-regula-
tory event, dictating both the amplitude and duration of the Ras
signal.

Neuroﬁbromin Is Destabilized by PKC
and the Proteasome in Glioblastoma Tumor Cell Lines
Having established the biochemical architecture of the growth
factor receptor-PKC-neuroﬁbromin-Ras signaling pathway, we
next asked whether its excessive activation might contribute
more generally to tumorigenesis. We investigated gliomas
because (1) the aberrant activation of PKC has been implicated
in gliomagenesis (Mackay and Twelves, 2007), (2) PKC inhibitors
exhibit potent effects in preclinical studies in this tumor type and
are currently in clinical development (da Rocha et al., 2002;
Mackay and Twelves, 2007), and (3) NF1 patients are predis-
posed to developing gliomas, indicating that NF1 can function
as a tumor suppressor in astrocytic tumors (Riccardi, 1992).

We ﬁrst investigated whether neuroﬁbromin was constitutively
destabilized by the proteasome in human glioblastoma (GBM)
cell lines. The GBM-derived U87 cell line has been shown to
possess aberrantly high levels of PKCa activity and is sensitive
to PKC inhibitors (Yazaki et al., 1996) (Figure 3A, left). Notably,
we found that proteasome inhibitors dramatically and rapidly
stabilized neuroﬁbromin protein (Figure 3A, left). As with most
proteasomal substrates, these inhibitors promoted the initial
appearance of higher-mobility polyubiquitinated forms of neuro-
ﬁbromin, manifested as an immunoreactive smear, followed by
a dramatic accumulation of unmodiﬁed protein, which increased
by 5.4-fold (Figure 3A, right). Neuroﬁbromin was rapidly stabi-
lized by multiple PKC inhibitors (Bis I, Ro-31-8220, and Bis II)
and stabilization was detected in 8 out of 12 GBM cell
lines
tested (Figures 3B–3D). Notably, the 3 cell lines that were insen-
sitive to the effects of PKC inhibitors exhibited the lowest levels
of PKC activity (Figure 3D; Figure S3). In addition, PKCa shRNA
constructs promoted the accumulation of neuroﬁbromin in U87
cells (Figure 3E). Thus, studies utilizing proteasome inhibitors,
multiple PKC inhibitors, and PKC shRNA constructs indicate
that neuroﬁbromin is destabilized via PKC in a signiﬁcant subset
of human GBM cell lines.

Neuroﬁbromin Destabilization Is Essential
for Transformation and Tumorigenesis
We next ascertained the biological consequences of preventing
neuroﬁbromin degradation. The nondegradable neuroﬁbromin
fragment (DRNF1) did not signiﬁcantly affect the proliferation of
GBM cells (Figure 3F, left), although it inhibited colony growth

Figure 2. PKC Regulates Ras Activation via Neuroﬁbromin Degrada-
tion
(A) Fibroblasts were infected with DRNF1-FLAG. Cells were cultured in 0.25%
serum for 24 hr and treated with PMA for increasing amounts of time. Levels of
endogenous neuroﬁbromin and p120RasGAP were assessed by immunoblot-
ting (IB) protein from total cell lysates (TCL). DRNF1-FLAG was detected by
immunoprecipitating (IP) this fragment from the same lysates, followed by
a FLAG immunoblot.
(B) Relative levels of Ras-GTP were assessed in cells expressing DRNF1-
FLAG or a control retrovirus (pbabe) in response to PMA as described in (A)
by performing a Ras pull-down assay. Ras-GTP levels were quantiﬁed as
described in Experimental Procedures.
(C) Relative levels of endogenous neuroﬁbromin were assessed in cells
expressing DRNF1-FLAG or the pbabe control retrovirus (cont).
(D) Relative levels of Ras activation were assessed in cells infected with
a control lentivirus (cont) or a lentivirus expressing an shRNA directed against
NF1, in low serum. Ras immunoblots from Ras pull-down assays are shown
(Ras-GTP), along with a Ras immunoblot from total cell
lysates (Ras IB
[TCL]) as loading controls. An NF1 immunoblot from total cell lysates (NF1 IB
[TCL]) was performed to conﬁrm knockdown.

PI3K, MEK, and PKC. Only the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide
I
(Bis I) blocked neuroﬁbromin degradation, and did so in
response to multiple growth factors (Figure 1D; see Figure S1A
available online). Bis I efﬁciently inhibited PKC activity, as it
suppressed the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein, a
well-characterized PKC substrate. Two additional PKC inhibi-
tors, Ro-31-8220 and bisindolylmaleimide II, had similar effects
(Figure 1E; Figure S1B). Conversely, activation of PKC via phor-
bol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) rapidly induced neuroﬁbromin
degradation (Figure 1F), and did so in multiple cell
types
(Figure S1C). Neuroﬁbromin levels were restored by 24 hr, at
which time PKC was downregulated by a negative feedback
loop (Liu and Heckman, 1998). Finally, expression of a constitu-
tively active form of PKCa also decreased neuroﬁbromin protein
levels (Figure 1G). Thus, these data indicate that PKC activation
is both necessary and sufﬁcient
to promote neuroﬁbromin
degradation, thus identifying the critical signal that mediates its
destruction.

PKC Promotes Ras Activation through
the Destabilization of Neuroﬁbromin
PKC is known to promote Ras activation, although the mecha-
nism by which this occurs has not been elucidated (Downward

in soft agar (Figure 3F, top right) and dramatically suppressed the
ability of such cells to form xenograft tumors (Figure 3F, bottom
right). These results indicate that neuroﬁbromin destabilization is
essential for the transformed and tumorigenic properties of these
GBM-derived cells in vitro and in vivo.

Neuroﬁbromin Is Destabilized by the Proteasome
in Primary GBM Cultures and Tumor Tissue
To extend these ﬁndings to primary tumor cells, we utilized
neurosphere cultures derived from a GBM that harbored an
ampliﬁcation of the PDGFRA gene (C.B. and I.K.M., unpublished
observations), a well-established activator of PKC. Notably, both
PKC and proteasome inhibitors resulted in a rapid stabilization of

neuroﬁbromin (Figure 3G). We next looked for evidence of
proteasomal degradation of neuroﬁbromin in primary human
tumor tissue. Neuroﬁbromin immunoblots were performed using
tissue from nine grade IV tumors that were resected prior to
treatment. Notably, no neuroﬁbromin was detected in two
samples (Figure 3H, lanes 1 and 5), and minimal
levels were
detected in an additional two tumors (lanes 3 and 8). Moreover,
in four out of nine samples a high-mobility neuroﬁbromin smear
was observed, consistent with the presence of polyubiquitinated
species. Thus, these observations support our studies in GBM
cell lines and primary cultures and are consistent with the model
that neuroﬁbromin is actively ubiquitinated and degraded in
a signiﬁcant subset of human GBMs. These ﬁndings differ from

the genetic observation that only 2.9% of sporadic glioblas-
tomas possess homozygous mutations in NF1 (TCGA Research
Network, 2008), and provide a mechanistic explanation for the
more frequent loss of expression observed by western analysis.

Complete NF1 Loss Triggers Cellular Senescence
in GBM Cells with an Intact p53 Pathway
In the course of our studies, we assessed the effects of RNAi-
mediated neuroﬁbromin loss in GBM cell lines. Unexpectedly,
ablation of neuroﬁbromin in U87 and Dbtrg-05mg cells triggered
cellular senescence, as demonstrated by a potent growth arrest,
a large ﬂattened morphology, and the detection of senescence-
associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity (Figures 4A
and 4B). In contrast, senescence was not observed in Gli36,
SF539, U251, T98G, M059J, and U138 cells (Figure 4B and
data not shown). Although we have previously shown that NF1
loss triggers cellular senescence of normal human diploid ﬁbro-
blasts (Courtois-Cox et al., 2006), it was nevertheless surprising
that the inactivation of NF1 triggered such a response in human

48 Cancer Cell 16, 44–54, July 7, 2009 ª2009 Elsevier Inc.

tumor cell lines that possess many additional genetic alterations.
Notably, however, all senescing cell lines expressed wild-type
p53 and retained a functional p53 pathway, as illustrated by
their induction of p21 (CDKN1A) in response to doxorubicin
(Figure 4C). In contrast, all the GBM-derived cell lines that did
not senesce in response to NF1 inactivation harbored p53 muta-
tions and/or a defective p53 response (Figure 4C; Ikediobi et al.,
2006; Van Meir et al., 1994). Moreover, when p53 was inactivated
by shRNA prior to the ablation of NF1 expression, the senes-
cence response was mitigated (Figure 4D and data not shown).

Astrocytomas from NF1 Patients Express Markers
of Senescence
Oncogene-induced senescence is thought to restrain tumorigen-
esis by preventing progression of benign tumors to malignancy
(Narita and Lowe, 2005). Notably, whereas NF1 patients are
predisposed to developing gliomas, the majority are benign pilo-
cytic astrocytomas that rarely, if ever, progress (Rodriguez et al.,
2008). Moreover, many tumors spontaneously stop growing and

a subset regress. Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of NF1 in
these astrocytic lesions might be restricting tumor development
by triggering a senescence response. Two pilocytic astrocy-
tomas from NF1 patients were obtained. p15INK4b, a reported
marker of oncogene-induced senescence, and p16INK4a, which
is also commonly detected in senescent tissue, were both highly
expressed in these tumors (Figure 4E and data not shown) (Col-
lado et al., 2005; Michaloglou et al., 2005). Tumors also express
p53, suggesting that this pathway is activated in these lesions.
SA-b-gal activity could not be assessed in these archived
samples; nevertheless, the expression of p15, p16, and p53
support the hypothesis that these tumors are restrained by onco-
gene-induced senescence. Interestingly, in previous studies,
Parada and colleagues had shown that inactivating mutations
in Nf1 and p53 cooperate to promote the development of
GBMs in mice, but only when p53 inactivation precedes, or is
coincident with, Nf1 loss (Zhu et al., 2005). Our ﬁndings suggest
a potential mechanistic explanation for these observations and
provide insight into the constraints governing glioma evolution
in NF1 patients.

Homozygous NF1 Mutations Are Present in GBM Cell
Lines and in Primary Tumors that Harbor p53 Mutations
The data shown in Figure 3 suggest that excessive PKC activity
and subsequent proteasomal degradation is one mechanism by
which neuroﬁbromin can be inactivated in GBMs. However, we
noted that 3 of 15 GBM cell lines that we were studying did not
express detectable levels of neuroﬁbromin protein, even in the
presence of PKC and proteasome inhibitors (data not shown).
Notably, all three cell lines (U251, LN229, and LN319) harbored
p53-inactivating mutations (Ikediobi et al., 2006; Tallen et al.,
2008; Van Meir et al., 1994). Because p53 inactivation appeared
to be permissive for total inactivation of NF1, we assessed the
status of the NF1 gene in each cell

examine changes in NF1 copy number, we examined data

from single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis that was per-
formed on archived tumor tissue from 141 spontaneous human
tumors (Beroukhim et al., 2007). None of these tumors exhibited
complete loss of the NF1 locus, consistent with other reported
ﬁndings (Jensen et al., 1995). However, 23 (16%) exhibited single
copy loss at the NF1 locus (Beroukhim et al., 2007). We then
utilized these tissue samples in a directed sequencing effort.
Based on our analysis of cell
lines, human tumors from NF1
patients, and previous mouse modeling studies, we reasoned
that null mutations in NF1 might only be tolerated in the absence
of functional p53. Therefore, we sequenced the NF1 gene in 14
of the 23 GBM tissue samples that also possessed p53 muta-
tions (Beroukhim et al., 2007).

Three out of

the 14 tumors with p53 alterations (21%)
possessed homozygous null NF1 mutations (Figure 5B). Impor-
tantly, all of these mutations were recurrent in NF1 patients
and/or resulted in a truncation before or within the catalytic
GAP-related domain.
In tumor 217, a mutation in exon 37
(c.6789_6792 delTTAC) was detected, resulting in a null NF1
allele that has been observed in NF1 patients (Pros et al.,
2008). Tumor 311 possessed a mutation in exon 23-2 (c4103
delT) resulting in a premature stop codon. In tumor 211, multiplex
ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation analysis indicated that
both NF1 alleles were present; however, two independent, inac-
tivating mutations were detected, one in exon 7 (c896-897
dupTT) and the other in exon 20 (c3496G > T), also representing
a recurrent patient mutation. Thus, the detection of null NF1
mutations in 3/15 GBM cell lines and 3/14 primary tumors indi-
cates that genetic inactivation of both NF1 copies does occur
in spontaneous human gliomas. While this manuscript was
under consideration, heterozygous alterations of the NF1 gene
(deletions and point mutations) were reported to occur in
GBMs in two other studies (Parsons et al., 2008; TCGA Research
Network, 2008). However, the latter study also reported that only
a small fraction of tumors, 6/203 (2.9%), possessed null muta-
tions in both NF1 alleles. The data in the present study extend
these observations by demonstrating that mutations in NF1
and p53 are coincidental in this tumor type and provide a mech-
anistic explanation for why complete genetic loss of NF1 neces-
sitates p53 inactivation. The observation that benign pilocytic
astrocytomas from NF1 patients express markers of senescence
and robust p53 expression provides additional in vivo evidence
to support the hypothesis that p53 plays a critical role in restrict-
ing the tumorigenic effects of NF1 inactivation.

The Mechanism by which NF1 Is Inactivated Imparts
Differential Sensitivities to Therapeutic Agents
The data described thus far suggest that NF1 may be sup-
pressed either by excessive proteasomal degradation of the
NF1 protein triggered by excessive PKC activity or by genetic
inactivation of the NF1 gene. To investigate whether these
distinct mechanisms of inactivation might impact the sensitivity
to speciﬁc therapeutic agents, the effects of PKC inhibitors on
tumor cell lines were assessed. Importantly, the GBM cell lines
in which we found neuroﬁbromin to be destabilized by PKC
were very sensitive to the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 (Figure 5C),
whereas cells that genetically lacked NF1 were relatively insen-
sitive to PKC inhibition (Figure 5D). The difference in IC50 values
between genotypes was found to be statistically signiﬁcant as

determined by a Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.05). In addition,
inactivation of NF1 via an shRNA-expressing lentivirus signiﬁ-
cantly decreased the response of normally sensitive cells to
PKC inhibitors (extra sum of squares F test, 1.65 3 10 5)
(Figure 5E). A similar differential sensitivity of genetically wild-
type versus NF1 mutant cell lines was observed with a second
PKC inhibitor (Figure S4). In addition, U87 cells were speciﬁcally
sensitive to genetic ablation of PKCa (Figure S5).

The sensitivity to PKC inhibitors was also assessed in the
primary GBM culture TS543, in which we found neuroﬁbromin
to be destabilized by PKC, in comparison to a second GBM
culture (TS565),
in which we detected two NF1 mutations
(c2195G > T, c470G > T) and a complete loss of neuroﬁbromin
protein expression (Figure S6). Consistent with data from GBM
cell lines, the TS543 cultures were exquisitely sensitive to PKC
inhibitors, whereas the TS565 cultures were relatively insensitive
(extra sum of squares F test, p = 4.657 3 10 6) (Figure 5F). Taken
together, these data suggest that PKC may represent a potential
therapeutic target in GBMs in which the NF1 gene is intact and
the protein is destabilized.

However, we and others have previously shown that neuroﬁ-
bromin critically regulates the mTOR pathway and that NF1 inac-
tivation confers sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors in other cell types
(Dasgupta et al., 2005; Johannessen et al., 2005). Therefore, in
an effort to identify a therapeutic agent that might be effective
on GBMs that harbor null genetic mutations in NF1, the effect
of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was assessed. Whereas GBM
cells that genetically lack NF1 exhibited a signiﬁcantly decreased
sensitivity to PKC inhibitors, we found that these cells were
exquisitely sensitive to the mTOR (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin
(Figure 5G). NF1-deﬁcient cells were also sensitive to the inacti-
vation of the mTOR pathway via RNAi-mediated suppression of
raptor, which is exclusively a component of
the mTORC1
complex (Figure S7). Conversely, the reintroduction of a neuroﬁ-
bromin fragment into NF1 null cells promoted rapamycin resis-
tance, indicating that NF1 loss was responsible for the observed
sensitivity (Figure 5G). Notably, in a recent phase I clinical trial,
rapamycin was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in a subset
of PTEN-deﬁcient glioblastomas (Cloughesy et al., 2008). These
studies suggest that NF1 mutations may be an additional genetic
event that may impact the sensitivity of sporadic glioblastomas
to mTOR inhibitors.

DISCUSSION

The NF1 tumor suppressor is mutated in the familial cancer
syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type I (Cawthon et al., 1990; Wal-
lace et al., 1990). Nevertheless, gross genomic loss of NF1
does not appear to be a common event in spontaneous human
tumors. The studies in this report reveal a critical role for NF1
inactivation in the development of sporadic human gliomas
and provide a framework for understanding how proteasomal
degradation and complete genetic inactivation of NF1 contribute
to this process (Figure 6).

PKC Regulates Neuroﬁbromin Stability
Prior to this work, neuroﬁbromin was known to be a direct target
of the proteasome; however, the precise signals that mediate its
destruction had not been identiﬁed (Cichowski et al., 2003). In

Cancer Cell

NF1 Inactivation in Gliomagenesis

dently shown to be hyperactivated in gliomas, presumably due
to the aberrant activation of these receptors (da Rocha et al.,
2002). However, it remains to be determined whether genetic
alterations in PKC itself may also occur in some tumors (Mackay
and Twelves, 2007). Interestingly, Ras mutations do not occur in
gliomas; however, Ras-GTP levels have been shown to be
elevated (Feldkamp et al., 1999; Furnari et al., 2007). Our data
suggest that the excessive destruction of neuroﬁbromin is one
mechanism that contributes to pathogenic levels of Ras activa-
tion in this tumor type.

Therapeutic Implications
These ﬁndings have important clinical
implications. Because
multiple GFRs have been shown to be concomitantly activated
in a single glioma, it has been suggested that combination ther-
apies designed to target multiple receptors may be required for
effective treatment (Stommel et al., 2007). By extension, these
studies suggest that PKC inhibitors may provide a potential
therapy for gliomas that genetically retain NF1 by simultaneously
suppressing tumorigenic signals from multiple activated recep-
tors. Notably, PKC inhibitors have been shown to be effective
in preclinical studies of GBMs in vitro and in vivo and are
currently in clinical development (da Rocha et al., 2002; Mackay
and Twelves, 2007). Our data reveal one mechanism by which
tumor cells are sensitized to these agents and indicate that
PKC may represent an important therapeutic target in GBMs in
which the NF1 gene is intact and the protein is destabilized.

NF1, p53, and Senescence
inactivation
Whereas these data indicate that proteasomal
of neuroﬁbromin contributes to gliomagenesis, we have also
detected NF1 mutations in cells and tumor tissue from sporadic
human gliomas. Two recent studies have also observed muta-
tions in the NF1 gene in GBMs (Parsons et al., 2008; TCGA
Research Network, 2008); however, complete genetic loss was
reported to be rare (TCGA Research Network, 2008). Thus, our
ﬁndings suggest that NF1 inactivation may play an even broader
role in glioma development than was previously recognized.
These studies also provide a biological framework for under-
standing how different mechanisms of
inactivation may be
required during tumor evolution. Whereas proteasomal reduction
and perhaps even heterozygosity may promote tumorigenicity,
this tissue type appears to be very sensitive to complete inactiva-
tion of NF1 and, in the latter context, p53 plays an important role
in restricting tumorigenesis. Genomic analysis of human tumor
tissue, cellular studies, the senescent properties of pilocytic
astrocytomas from NF1 patients, and mouse modeling efforts
(Zhu et al., 2005), all suggest that homozygous null NF1 mutations
are only tolerated in the absence of an intact p53 pathway. Thus,
the present study demonstrates that NF1 and p53 mutations are
coincidental in sporadic human gliomas and provides mecha-
nistic insight into why the order of mutational events inﬂuences
glioma progression. This model also highlights why proteasomal
inactivation (perhaps coupled with genetic heterozygosity) may
represent a more prevalent mechanism of NF1 inactivation in
gliomas.

It should be noted that NF1 shares many functional similarities
with PTEN, which is also thought to promote tumorigenesis via
genetic inactivation and enhanced proteasomal degradation.

Figure 6. Model
Proteasomal Degradation of NF1 Functions in Gliomagenesis
We hypothesize that NF1 inactivation participates in gliomagenesis via three
distinct mechanisms. Left: because NF1 patients are born with an NF1 muta-
tion, the majority of tumors that arise are likely to be driven by a second hit
mutation in the remaining NF1 allele. This event would be predicted to result
in an initial burst of proliferation and ultimately the development of pilocytic
astrocytomas. If the p53 pathway is intact (expected in the majority of cases),
tumors undergo senescence and are unable to progress. Middle: however,
neuroﬁbromin can also be excessively destabilized by PKC and the protea-
some. Heterozygous mutations in NF1 may further decrease protein levels in
some tumors. Importantly, neuroﬁbromin instability promotes tumorigenesis
but is not sufﬁcient to trigger a senescence response. Data generated from
GBM cell lines and primary cultures further suggest that tumors with an intact
NF1 gene, but destabilized protein, may be sensitive to PKC inhibitors. Right:
heterozygous deletions or mutations in NF1 also occur. We hypothesize that
mutations in the p53 pathway would be permissive for a second hit mutation
in NF1. Such tumors would effectively evade the senescence response. Our
preclinical studies further suggest that NF1-deﬁcient GBMs may be sensitive
to mTOR inhibitors.

this study, we show that activation of PKC is both necessary and
sufﬁcient for neuroﬁbromin degradation. This ﬁnding has impor-
tant implications for normal signal transduction pathways as well
as tumorigenesis. Speciﬁcally, these studies demonstrate that
the NF1 tumor suppressor is a critical mediator of Ras activation
downstream of PKC and experimentally illustrate that robust Ras
activation requires the coordinated regulation of GEFs (guanine
nucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs. Notably, the intensity
of the Ras signal is tightly regulated and is critical for specifying
biological responses to growth factors (Marshall, 1995). The
observation that numerous receptors can trigger neuroﬁbromin
degradation suggests that in vivo the extent of neuroﬁbromin
degradation and consequential Ras activation may be dictated
by the intensity of combined GFR/PKC signals.

Deregulated Signal Transduction Pathways
in Gliomagenesis
We have also demonstrated that
the PKC-neuroﬁbromin
signaling axis is aberrantly activated in spontaneous gliomas
and that neuroﬁbromin destabilization is required for the tumor-
igenic properties of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Notably,
numerous GFRs have been implicated in glioma development
(Furnari et al., 2007). Importantly, the majority, if not all of these
receptors, activate PKC. PKC activity has also been indepen-

Cancer Cell

NF1 Inactivation in Gliomagenesis

Moreover, like NF1, complete inactivation of PTEN early in the
tumorigenic process (in the prostate) appears to limit tumor
development by promoting cellular senescence (Chen et al.,
2005). Such observations suggest that exquisitely sensitive
protective mechanisms have evolved to respond to aberrant
oncogenic signals above a certain threshold, resulting from
complete, but not partial, inactivation of these tumor suppres-
sors. Thus, studies aimed at further elucidating this tumor
suppressive response, as well as deﬁning additional proteins
that contribute to the proteasomal regulation of these tumor
suppressors, may identify new genes that restrict or promote
human cancer. Finally, because such protective responses exist,
different mechanisms of inactivation may be selected for during
the course of tumor development, which may depend on the
complement of genetic alterations already present. Moreover,
our data suggest that deﬁning the mechanism by which a tumor
suppressor

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Cell Culture
NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with calf serum. IMR90,
RT4, A172, U138, M059J, U87, U251, Gli36, SF539, Dbtrg-05mg, human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
(MEFs) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum.

Human Subjects
The collection and analysis of human tissue samples was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Los Angeles, and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. For tissues obtained in Figures 3H and 4E, the Ofﬁce of
Research Protections at Brigham and Women’s Hospital ruled that this study
does not represent human subject research due to exemption 32 CFR
219.101(b)4: the research involved collection or study of existing pathological
specimens that are publicly provided without identiﬁers.

TS Cultures
Tumor sphere (TS) cell cultures were isolated from primary human glioblas-
tomas by disassociation into a single cell suspension with Accumax (Innova-
tive Cell Technologies). Cells were ﬁltered through a 100 mm ﬁlter, and then
washed and plated in NeuroCult NS-A proliferation media (Stem Cell Technol-
ogies) supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems), FGF (10 ng/ml; R&D
Systems), and heparin (2 mg/ml).

Degradation Time Courses and PKC Inhibition
NIH 3T3 and IMR90 cells were plated in serum-free medium at 5 3 105 cells/
10 cm plate. HUVEC, RT4, and GBM cell lines were plated in 1% serum, and
primary GBM cultures were plated in the media described above. After 18 hr,
cells were treated with either 1 mM Bis I, 1 mM Bis II, 2.5–5 mM Ro-31-8220
(Calbiochem), or 1 mM Go 6976 (LC Laboratories) or vehicle. In Figure 1, cells
were pretreated with inhibitors 30 min before adding 6 mM LPA, 20 ng/ml
PDGF, or 10 ng/ml PMA. Cells were lysed at speciﬁed time points with 1%
SDS boiling lysis buffer or RIPA buffer.

Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations
The following antibodies were used: neuroﬁbromin (C-terminal antibodies:
UP69, a polyclonal antibody raised against a KLH-conjugated peptide, RNSIK
KIV [used for all experiments except Figure 3G]; Courtois-Cox et al., 2006) and
A300-140A (Bethyl Laboratories). N-terminal antibody: Ab NF1-5.16 (a mono-
clonal antibody provided by K. Scheffzek and G. Moldenhauer); pMARCKs
(Calbiochem); HA (12CA5; Roche), PKCa (BD Biosciences); p21 WAF1/cip-1
(c-19; Santa Cruz); phospho-PKC motif 2351 (Cell Signaling), and GAPDH
(Cell Signaling) (Johannessen et al., 2005).

Retroviral and Lentiviral Infections
Retroviral and lentiviral infections were performed as described (Johannessen
et al., 2005). PKCaCAT-HA and DRNF1-FLAG were introduced into the pbabe
retroviral vector. The DRNF1-FLAG construct possesses a FLAG epitope tag
and encodes amino acids 1175–1535. This protein fragment retains RasGAP
activity and has been shown to be resistant to ubiquitination and degradation
in vitro (Cichowski et al., 2003). The lentiviral pLKO vector containing the
following shRNAs were used: NF1#2(H9), 50-TTATAAATAGCCTGGAAAAGG-30;
PKCa1 (e1), 50-CCGTCTTAACACCACCTGA TCTCGAGATCAGGTGGTGTTAA
GACGG-30; PKCa #2(D12), 50-ATGGAACTCAGGCAGAAATTCT CGAGAGAA
TTTCTGCCTGAGTTCCAT-30. The retroviral pMSCV-pM vector containing the
following shRNA was used: p53 shRNA, 50-GGCCTGACTCAGACTGACATT-30.

Ras Activation Analysis
Cells were cultured in the presence of 0.25% serum, and 10 ng/ml of PMA was
added for increasing amounts of time. Ras-GTP levels were detected using
a Ras activation assay, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce
Biotechnology). Ras-GTP activation was quantiﬁed by using Photoshop to
assess the amount of Ras that was pulled down with the Ras binding domain,
divided by total levels of Ras in the lysates. Values at 5 and 15 min were then
normalized to control to establish levels of fold Ras activation.

Proteasome Inhibitor Treatment
lines and primary neurosphere cultures were treated with 1 mM
GBM cell
bortezomib (LC Laboratories) or 10 mM MG132 (Boston Biochem) and 1 mM
bortezomib as speciﬁed and lysed at designated time points.

Soft Agar Assay
Soft agar assays were performed as described (Johannessen et al., 2005).

Subcutaneous Implantation
Animal procedures were approved by the Center for Animal and Comparative
Medicine at the Harvard Medical School in accordance with the NIH Guild for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Subcu-
taneous implantations in athymic male nude mice (nu/nu; 6 weeks old) were
carried out as previously described (Berger et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, 2.5 3 106 of
U87 cells expressing pbabe DRNF1-FLAG or pbabe vector in 100 ml of PBS
were injected subcutaneously (six injections per condition). Two weeks
after injection (day 0), the width and length of the tumor were measured every
2-3 days by caliper, and the volume was calculated with the following formula:
volume = (length 3 width2)p/6.

Growth Curves
U87 cells expressing pbabe DRNF1-FLAG or pbabe vector were plated in trip-
licate at 5 3 105 in a 6-well dish and counted every other day. Dbtrg-05mg cells
expressing p53 shRNA and NF1 shRNA or p53 shRNA and vector were plated
in triplicate at 2 3 105 and counted on day 1, 7, and 9. For the cumulative pop-
ulation doubling assay, 2 3 105 cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well dishes.
Cells were counted and reseeded at a density of 2 3 105 every 3 days for ﬁve
passages. Population doublings were calculated as described (Courtois-Cox
et al., 2006).

SA-b-Gal Activity
SA-b-gal activity was performed as described and percentages were
assessed by counting at least 300 cells (Dimri et al., 1995).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for p16 was performed as described using the
p16INK4a antibody (Ab-7, MS-1064-P; Neomarkers), the p53 antibody (D07;
Signet Laboratories), or the p15 antibody (C-20, sc-612; Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology) (Courtois-Cox et al., 2006).

NF1 Mutational Analysis
The entire NF1 coding region was ampliﬁed in ﬁve overlapping RT-PCR frag-
ments and used as the template for direct sequencing as described (Messiaen
et al., 2000). Copy number analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe
ampliﬁcation was performed as described (Wimmer et al., 2006). The nomen-
clature of the mutations is based on NF1 mRNA sequence NM_000267.1, with

Cancer Cell

1 being the ﬁrst nucleotide of the ATG start codon. The NF1 exons are named
according to the most widely used nomenclature adapted by the researchers
and diagnostic labs, which does not use strictly consecutive numbers.

IC50 Determinations and Viability Assays
NF1+/+ and NF1 /  GBM cell lines (3 3 103) were plated in replicates of eight in
a 96-well dish. Cells were treated with 0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 4, 5, 7.5, or 10 mM
Ro-31-8220 or vehicle for 18 hr before assessing viability by adenosine
triphosphate quantiﬁcation using a Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell viability
assay kit (Promega). Gli36 cells were infected with NF1#2 shRNA or vector
and selected in puromycin for 2 days. Cells (3 3 103) were plated in 96-well
dishes and IC50 values were determined as described above. To calculate
IC50 values for GBM neurospheres TS543 and TS565, cells were plated in
growth factor-free media and treated with the speciﬁed PKC inhibitor at the
concentrations indicated for 24 hr. Cells were evaluated for viability and cell
counts using a Vi Cell XR analyzer (Beckman Coulter).

Rapamycin Sensitivity Assays
Twenty thousand cells were seeded per well of a 6-well dish. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin in trip-
licate. Log-phase cells treated with rapamycin or vehicle were isolated after
three doubling periods, and viable cells were counted.

Statistical Analysis
All numerical data including error bars represent the mean ± the standard devi-
ation. Speciﬁc statistical tests for each experiment are described in the text.
