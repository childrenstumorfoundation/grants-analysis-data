Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized primarily by tumor formation in the nervous
system, but patients report other neurological complications including pain and itch. Individuals
with NF1 harbor one mutated NF1 allele causing heterozygous expression in all of their cells. In
mice, Nf1 heterozygosity led to hyperexcitability of sensory neurons and hyperproliferation of
mast cells, both of which could lead to increased hypersensitivity and scratching in response to
noxious and pruritic stimuli. To determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity may increase pain and itch
behaviors independent of secondary effects of tumor formation, we used mice with a targeted,
heterozygous Nf1 gene deletion (Nf1+/−) that lack tumors. Nf1+/− mice exhibited normal baseline
responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Moreover, with similar to wild-type littermates,
Nf1+/− mice developed inflammation-induced heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, capsaicin-
induced nocifensive behavior, histamine-dependent or –independent scratching, and chronic
constriction injury-induced cold allodynia. However, Nf1+/− mice exhibited an attenuated first
phase of formalin-induced spontaneous behavior and expedited resolution of formalin-induced
heat hypersensitivity. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity
alone is sufficient to increase pain and itch sensation in mice, and suggest that additional
mechanisms may underlie reports of increased pain and itch in NF1 patients.
Perspective—This study assessed whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increased
hypersensitivity and scratching following noxious and pruritic stimuli. Using Nf1+/− mice lacking
tumors, this study finds no increases in pain or itch behavior, suggesting that there is no
predisposition for either clinical symptom solely due to Nf1 heterozygosity.

Introduction

Page 2

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects
approximately 1 in 3000 people worldwide. The disease results from a germline mutation in
the NF1 tumor suppressor gene encoding a Ras-GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP),
neurofibromin, which is expressed throughout the nervous system11, 19. NF1 is clinically
characterized by tumor formation leading to generation of optic gliomas, neurofibromas,
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and an increased incidence of rare cancers10. In
addition, individuals with NF1 report neurological complications, including pain and itch. In
this regard, there is a significant effect of body pain on their quality of life, which increases
with disease severity7, 14, 24, 26, 36, 42. Likewise, itch is a neurological symptom that closely
correlates with quality of life in children with NF123. However, in these clinical reports on
NF1 patients, clinicians often ascribe the pain and itch as either a direct or an indirect
consequence of tumor burden7, 9.

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the clinicians may mistakenly identify tumor
load as causative for increased pain and/or itch in NF1 patients. In an in vitro study,
heterozygous deletion of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/−) in mice leads to increased excitability of
capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons40, 41. Moreover, Nf1+/− capsaicin-sensitive, sensory
neurons exhibit increased stimulus-evoked release of the peptide transmitter, calcitonin gene
releasing peptide (CGRP)18. These capsaicin-sensitive neurons comprise a subpopulation of
sensory neurons known to transmit pain and itch stimuli39, 43 and are necessary for both
inflammatory pain and itch32. This increased transmission through neurons involved in pain
and itch could conceivably cause Nf1+/− mice to be hypersensitive to nociceptive and
pruriceptive stimuli.

Besides increasing neuronal excitability, the Nf1+/− microenvironment may exacerbate
behavioral responses to inflammatory mediators and pruritogens. In Nf1 mouse models,
Nf1+/− mast cells exhibit increased proliferation and secretion of cytokines20, 21, 45.
Moreover, Nf1+/− mast cells are crucial for tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of
this Nf1+/− mast cell phenotype in the disease27, 46. Mast cells are known to contribute to
inflammatory pain and histamine-dependent itch through cytokine release and subsequent
nociceptor sensitization12, 28, 31. Therefore, this Nf1+/− mast cell phenotype likely would
increase both inflammatory pain and pruritogen-induced itch through heightened cytokine
release and subsequent nociceptor sensitization.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increases pain
and itch behavior. We sought to determine whether there is increased pain and itch behavior
in Nf1+/− mice, which lack tumors, using assessments of somatosensation, itch, chronic
inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. Herein, we demonstrate that Nf1+/− mice exhibit
no hypersensitivity to acute noxious or pruritic stimuli, and have unaltered hypersensitivity
in the context of inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Moreover, contrary to our
original hypothesis, formalin-induced nocifensive responses are attenuated. Overall, Nf1
heterozygosity in mice does not increase pain or itch behaviors, arguing that reduced Nf1
expression is unlikely to be the primary etiology for the increased pain and itch observed in
individuals with NF1.

ad libitum access to food and water. Targeted deletion of the Nf1 gene was achieved by
homologous recombination at the Nf1 locus as previously described4. Nf1+/− and wild-type
mice were bred and maintained on an inbred C57/Bl6 background. Experiments were all
performed on seven-to-ten week old male Nf1+/− and wild-type littermates. Mice were
genotyped using the protocol described previously4. For all experiments, the experimenter
was blind to genotype.

Measurement of thermal and mechanical thresholds

All mice were tested in isolated behavior rooms at ~25°C with white noise generators to
reduce the influence of outside sounds on testing. Each mouse was placed in an individual,
plexiglass behavioral chamber (width, 10 cm; length, 10 cm; height, 15 cm) separated by
opaque dividers to prevent mice from seeing each other during testing. Prior to all behavior
tests, mice were allowed to acclimate in these chambers for 2–3 hours. Following
acclimation, behavioral responses to heat, mechanical, or cold stimuli were assessed as
described below.

To measure withdrawal thresholds to heat stimuli, a modified Hargreaves’ test was
performed1, 17. Briefly, mice were placed into behavioral chambers on a pre-warmed
(~30°C) glass plate (390G Plantar Test Appar atus, IITC Life Science). Following
acclimation, a radiant heat source was applied to the footpad of the hindlimb with an active
intensity of 17% maximal, an inactive intensity of 3% maximal, and a cutoff of 20 seconds.
Only awake, still mice were tested. Five independent measures were performed for each paw
on all mice to establish baseline. Following injection of an inflammatory mediator the next
day, withdrawal latency at hourly time points was obtained by averaging two measurements
per paw performed during that hour. Each subsequent day’s mean value consisted of three
independent measures per paw for each mouse. All paw withdrawal latencies from the
injection day and subsequent days were converted into and graphed as percent baseline.

For the responses to mechanical stimuli, mice were placed in behavioral chambers on a wire
mesh. Modified, calibrated filaments (North Coast Medical) were used to assess mechanical
thresholds using the up-down method6. Briefly, a filament was applied between the anterior
and posterior hind paw footpads of awake, still mice. Filaments were bent slightly when
applied and held for ~2 seconds prior to removal. Withdrawal to this stimulus was scored as
a response to the filament. For baselines, mice were tested three times per paw and
withdrawal thresholds were averaged. On the injection day of an inflammatory mediator,
hourly time points represented one measurement per paw for each mouse. Subsequent days
used the average of three independent measurements as on the baseline day.

For responses to cold stimuli, two different tests were used to assess either ongoing
responses or paw withdrawal latency to a cold stimulus. Responses to cold stimuli were
assessed using a drop of acetone (Sigma Aldrich) applied to the plantar surface of the hind
paw as described previously15. The mice were observed for 5 minutes following this
stimulus for signs of ongoing behaviors related to this cold stimulus including licking,
lifting, and flicking of the tested hind paw. A positive response was defined as any of these
behaviors occurring after the first 15 seconds following the stimulus since all mice
responded during this period15. Likewise, time spent in these behaviors was recorded in the
5-minute period again excluding any time during the first 15 seconds. Additionally, paw
withdrawal latency to a cold stimulus was measured using the cold plantar assay5. Briefly,
mice were placed into behavioral chambers on ¼ inch glass. Powdered dry ice packed into a
modified 3 ml syringe was applied to the glass surface underneath the plantar surface of the
paw. Targeting was achieved using mirrors underneath the testing platform. Paw withdrawal
latency was assessed every 7 minutes alternating between paws for each mouse. Five

measurements were taken per paw and all were averaged together to obtain the paw
withdrawal latency for each mouse.

Thermotaxis and Temperature Preference

Thermotaxis behavior was assessed using a thermal gradient assay on an apparatus (GNF
Systems Gradient Plate Version 1.0, San Diego, CA) ranging in temperature from ~12°C to
~47°C as described previo usly13. Briefly, mice were acclimated to the room in their home
cage for 2–3 hours prior to testing. On the day prior to performing the gradient assay, mice
were then acclimated for 2 hours on the apparatus with no temperature gradient. On the day
of testing, the gradient was turned on during the mouse acclimation to the room in their
home cage. Immediately prior to testing, the temperature of 20 equal-sized zones was
determined by averaging the temperatures at the zone’s edges. Mice were then placed in the
apparatus and tested for 2 hours. Anymaze software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was
used to track the center of each mouse and determine the mouse’s zone location for time in
zone calculations on both days. Temperature preference was defined as the temperature of
the zone in which a mouse spent the most time for the entire test.

Formalin-induced spontaneous behaviors and heat hypersensitivity

On the day prior to testing mice for spontaneous behaviors associated with formalin
intraplantar injection, mice were tested for their baseline responses to a radiant heat source.
The following day, mice were acclimated on a Plexiglass platform in behavioral chambers
for at least 2 hours. Following acclimation, mice were injected with a 10 μl intraplantar,
subcutaneous dose of 2% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in a sterile 0.9% NaCl
solution and were immediately returned to their assigned behavioral chamber1. Once all
animals were injected, the experimenter exited the room quietly, and a video recording was
taken for 1 hour using a webcam (Logitech, Newark, CA) with 960 x 720 video resolution.
Spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of licking, lifting, and flicking were measured in 5-
minute bins from these videos. During data analysis, the test was also divided into two
distinct phases: the first phase (0–10 minutes) and the second phase (10–60 minutes) to
assess both peripheral and central sensitization respectively. For responses to the radiant
heat source using the modified Hargreaves’ test, mice were transported to the Hargreaves’
apparatus immediately following the hour of spontaneous behavior. These mice were
allowed to acclimate for an hour after which 2 and 3-hour paw withdrawal thresholds
following the initial injection were measured as described above. On subsequent days, three
independent measures of paw withdrawal thresholds were performed and averaged.

Capsaicin-induced spontaneous behavior

Following acclimation, mice were injected with an intraplantar, subcutaneous dose of 10 μl
of capsaicin (1μg/10 μl; Sigma-Aldrich). A video recording was taken for 5 minutes post-
capsaicin injection using a webcam (Logitech, Newark, CA) with 960 x 720 video
resolution. Spontaneous nocifensive behaviors of licking, lifting, and flicking were
measured for 5 minutes after injection of capsaicin from these videos.

Inflammation-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity

Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; 10 μl, 1.0 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the
hind paw using an intraplantar, subcutaneous injection in order to induce a model of
inflammatory pain known to be dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF)44. Mechanical
hypersensitivity following CFA was assessed as described above. Following intraplantar
injection of CFA, average paw withdrawal latencies were obtained from one measurement
per paw for each hour after injection. For the subsequent day(s), three measurements were
taken per paw and averaged to obtain a day mean value for both tests. In separate cohorts of

mice, NGF (10 μl, 20 ng/μl; Harlan Laboratories) was injected subcutaneously on the
intraplantar surface of the hind paw and heat sensitivity was evaluated as described above.
Average paw withdrawal latencies were obtained from two measurements per paw for each
hour after injection and three measurements per paw on subsequent days following injection.

Pruritogen-induced scratching behaviors

For itch experiments, mice were placed into behavioral chambers on a Plexiglass platform
and allowed to acclimate for at least 2 hours. To assess histamine-dependent scratching,
histamine was injected subcutaneously into the nape of the neck. Briefly, for all itch
experiments, the nape of the neck was shaved the day prior to testing. On the day of testing,
histamine (50 μg/10 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the nape of the neck while
restraining the mouse. Likewise, to assess effects of mast cell degranulation and subsequent
histamine-dependent and –independent scratching, the potent mast cell degranulator,
compound 48/80 (60 μg/30 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the nape of the neck in
separate experiments. To assess histamine-independent scratching, separate experiments
used the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine (200 μg/50 μl; Sigma-Aldrich). For all these
experiments, mice were immediately placed back in their assigned behavioral chambers and
bouts of scratching were measured live in 5-minute bins for 30 minutes following injection.

Chronic constriction injury (CCI) model

As a model of neuropathic injury, chronic constriction injury (CCI) was conducted using a
modified version of the rat CCI model3. Briefly, the day prior to surgery, mice were tested
for their acute responses to acetone as described above. Then, on the day of surgery, mice
were anesthesized using an anesthetic mixture of ketamine (38 mg/mL, Fort Dodge Animal
Health, Fort Dodge, IA), xylazine (1.92 mg/mL, Akorn Inc. Decatur, IL), and acepromazine
(0.38 mg/mL, Butler Animal Health Supply, Dublin, OH). Upon loss of response to tail
pinch, an incision was made into the upper thigh and the leg muscles were separated by
blunt dissection to expose the sciatic nerve proximal to its branching into the three main
branches. Using chromic gut, two loose ligatures were placed around the sciatic nerve
approximately 1 mm apart. The skin was then sutured using 6-0 silk. Aseptic techniques
were used throughout the ~1 hour-long surgery. Mice were allowed to recover on a warmed
surgical pad until they were able to move freely, at which time they were returned to their
home cage. Responses to acetone were tested as outlined above 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, 14
days, and 28 days after surgery in order to assess development and resolution of cold
allodynia.

Statistical Analyses

Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (GraphPad) software were used to analyze all data. Data in all
graphs are reported as the mean +/− the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
analyses are described in the Results section for each experiment. For all tests, p-values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli
To test whether there is predisposition for increased pain and itch behavior due to Nf1
heterozygosity, we used Nf1+/− male mice4 to measure responses to thermal and
mechanical stimuli. Thermotaxis behavior and temperature preferences were similar in
Nf1+/− and wild-type littermate mice (Figure 1A, two-way ANOVA and t-test respectively).
Likewise, there was no difference in either the latency to paw withdrawal from a radiant
heat source or paw withdrawal threshold from a mechanical stimulus between Nf1+/− and

wild-type littermate mice (Figure 1B–C; t-tests). Responses to evaporative cooling of
acetone did not differ between groups either in percent of trials responding or total time
responding in naïve mice (Figure 1D; t-tests). Likewise, there was no difference in paw
withdrawal latency between Nf1+/− and wild-type littermate mice as measured by the cold
plantar assay (Figure 1E; t-test). Overall, these data indicate that Nf1 heterozygosity does
not alter baseline sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli.

Nf1 heterozygosity decreased formalin-induced nocifensive responses

To assess whether there are alterations in peripheral or central mechanisms of processing
nociceptive stimuli in Nf1+/− mice, we compared formalin-induced spontaneous behaviors
and heat hypersensitivity induced by formalin injection between Nf1+/− and wild-type
littermate mice. Despite the evidence for hyperexcitability of a subpopulation of
nociceptors18, 40, 41, there was no statistically significant difference in the time course of the
formalin-induced spontaneous nocifensive behavior between groups (Figure 2A; two-way
repeated measures (RM) ANOVA). Moreover, when the test was parsed into its two distinct
phases, there was a decrease in the first phase (0–10 minutes) for the Nf1+/− mice compared
to their wild-type littermates (Figure 2B; t-test **p<0.01), but no difference in the second
phase (10–60 minutes) between groups (Figure 2B; t-test). Similarly, formalin-induced heat
hypersensitivity was attenuated in Nf1+/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates
(Figure 2C; two-way RM ANOVA; main effect of genotype *p<0.05). A Bonferroni post-
hoc test revealed a difference in hypersensitivity between groups at 1 day post-formalin,
wherein the Nf1+/− male mice are less hypersensitive (Figure 2C; two-way RM ANOVA
**p<0.01). Overall, these data suggest that Nf1 heterozygosity decreases behavioral
sensitization to formalin and thus, this result contradicts the hypothesis that Nf1
heterozygosity may increase pain behaviors.

Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior

In vitro, Nf1+/− capsaicin-sensitive neurons exhibit hyper-responsiveness to stimuli18, 40, 41
that may lead to increased behavioral hypersensitivity to capsaicin in the Nf1+/− mice. To
assess whether this Nf1+/− capsaicin-sensitive neuron hyperexcitability40, 41 and their
increased stimulus-evoked CGRP release in vitro18 lead to an exacerbated nocifensive
response to capsaicin, we compared capsaicin-induced spontaneous nocifensive behavior in
Nf1+/− and wild-type littermates. Following intraplantar, subcutaneous injection of 1μg/10
μl capsaicin, Nf1+/− and wild-type littermates exhibited similar time spent responding in the
initial five minutes post-capsaicin (Figure 2D, unpaired t-test). Therefore, despite in vitro
reports of hyper-responsiveness of this sensory neuron population in Nf1+/−, Nf1
heterozygosity does not alter the behavioral response to capsaicin.

Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter NGF-dependent nocifensive responses to heat or
mechanical stimuli

Previous studies have shown that NGF can initiate peripheral sensitization both directly via
activation of signaling cascades in nociceptors and indirectly via activation of mast cells
causing cytokine release12, 28, 31. In light of previous reports of hyperexcitability of Nf1+/−
nociceptors18, 40, 41 and the increased activity of Nf1+/− mast cells20, 21, 45, we hypothesized
that Nf1+/− mice might develop more robust NGF-induced heat hypersensitivity relative to
wild type mice. To assess whether Nf1+/− mice exhibit increased NGF-dependent
hypersensitvity, we tested both NGF-induced heat hypersensitivity and CFA-induced
mechanical hypersensitivity in Nf1+/− mice and their wild type littermates. Following
injection of 0.2 μg NGF, Nf1+/− and wild-type littermate mice develop similar thermal
hypersensitivity that resolved 48 hours later (Figure 3A, two-way RM ANOVA). Both
genotypes also develop similar mechanical hypersensitivity following 10 μl injection of

CFA (Figure 3A, two-way RM ANOVA). Overall, these data suggest that there is no
alteration in NGF-dependent hypersensitivity as a result of Nf1 heterozygosity.

Nf1 heterozygosity does not alter histamine-dependent or histamine–independent
scratching

Although NGF-dependent hypersensitivity was unchanged, hyperactivity of Nf1+/−
nociceptors18, 40, 41 and mast cells20, 21, 45 could increase histamine-dependent scratching.
Therefore, to determine whether histamine-dependent itch was altered by Nf1
heterozygosity, we quantified bouts of scratching behavior following injection of histamine.
Nf1+/− mice were not statistically different compared to wild-type littermates in either the
time course of scratching bouts (Figure 4A; two-way RM ANOVA) or the total number of
scratching bouts following histamine (Nf1+/−: 91.86±13.61; WT: 109±25.59; unpaired t-
test). To determine if mast cell degranulation caused increased scratching in Nf1+/− mice,
we quantified scratching after administration of a potent mast cell degranulator, compound
48/80. Again, there was no difference between genotypes in the time course of scratching
bouts (Figure 4B, two-way RM ANOVA) or the total number of scratching bouts following
compound 48/80 (Nf1+/−: 397.17±48.61; WT: 404.44±29.27; unpaired t-test). While the
itch phenotype in individuals with NF1 is currently not well characterized, clinical
complaints of itch in the context of NF1 may result from histamine-independent
mechanisms of itch. To assess whether histamine-independent itch is altered in Nf1+/−
mice, we measured bouts of scratching following injection of the pruritic anti-malaria drug,
chloroquine. Nf1+/− mice were not statistically different compared to wild-type littermates
in either the time course for scratching bouts (Figure 4C; two-way RM ANOVA) or the total
number of scratching bouts (Nf1+/−: 292.83± 40.91;WT: 323.5±36.75; unpaired t-test).
Overall, these results suggest that there is no difference between these groups in either
histamine-dependent or histamine-independent scratching.

Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter the development or maintenance of cold allodynia after
CCI

Previous report show that there is increased excitability of DRG sensory neurons after the
dissociation injury necessary for in vitro electrophysiological studies48. Therefore, since the
reported hyperexcitability of Nf1+/− sensory neurons40, 41 did not lead to increased acute
pain, inflammatory pain, or itch, it is conceivable that Nf1 heterozygosity may exacerbate
nerve injury-induced excitability and thus, may predispose Nf1+/− mice to increased nerve
injury-induced pain. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the extent of cold allodynia
following CCI in both Nf1+/− and wild-type male littermates. Nf1+/− mice and wild-type
littermates did not differ in percent response to acetone following CCI (Figure 5A; RM 2-
way ANOVA). Likewise, both genotypes exhibited similar time responding to the acetone
stimuli after CCI (Figure 5A; RM 2-way ANOVA). Overall, these data suggest that there is
no change in the development or maintenance of cold allodynia following CCI due to Nf1
heterozygosity.

Discussion

Although reported pain and itch in individuals with NF1 may result directly from NF1
heterozygosity, studies have yet to address this question. In this present study, we directly
assess whether Nf1 heterozygosity alone increases responses to nociceptive and pruriceptive
stimuli using Nf1+/− mice lacking nerve sheath tumors. We found that Nf1+/− mice did not
exhibit increased sensitivity to acute, inflammatory, or neuropathic pain, or to pruritogens.
Therefore, Nf1 heterozygosity alone does not result in increased pain and itch.

Unexpectedly, formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors were attenuated in Nf1+/− mice,
suggesting that peripheral afferent activation may be blunted in Nf1+/− DRG neurons. Since
the first phase of spontaneous behavior elicited by formalin is thought to be dependent on
peripheral afferent activation30, a decrease in formalin-induced spontaneous behavior for
only the first phase is consistent with decreased afferent activation in vivo following
formalin injection in the paw. This result directly contradicts reports of in vitro
hyperexcitability of Nf1+/− sensory neurons and increased CGRP release by
nociceptors18, 40, 41. Unaltered nocifensive responses to capsaicin in Nf1+/− mice provides
further evidence against the in vivo relevance of the reported, in vitro Nf1+/− sensory
neuron hyperexcitability. As such, the behavioral data are consistent with the hypothesis that
in vivo primary afferent nociceptors are not hyperexcitable to stimuli, but may actually be
hypoexcitable, contrary to in vitro results. Future experiments should address this question
using electrophysiological recordings, such as the skin-nerve preparation that more closely
represents the situation in vivo in order to determine whether there is altered excitability of
nociceptors in vivo. Alternatively, this blunted nocifensive behavior in the first phase of the
formalin test may indicate a central mechanism of inhibition or may highlight the
importance of other variables such as gender, depression and tumor burden in the pain and
itch phenotypes observed in individuals with NF1.

In Nf1+/− mice, there is evidence to suggest that activity-dependent GABAergic inhibition
may be increased, which could suppress pain and itch behaviors. Previous studies have
shown that Nf1 heterozygosity in forebrain inhibitory neurons increases GABA release
following high frequency stimulation and thus adversely affects spatial learning8. If
GABAergic inhibition is increased in the spinal cord or midbrain in Nf1+/− mice, the
hypothesized pathological pain in Nf1+/− mice may be prevented since GABAA receptor
activation in spinal and midbrain structures relieves hyperalgesia in mice25, 35, 47. Similarly,
since inhibition of itch requires spinal cord dorsal horn inhibitory neurons including
GABAergic neurons, increased GABA release in the spinal cords of Nf1+/− mice could
prevent behavioral sensitization to pruritogens37. Future studies should test whether there is
an increase in GABAergic inhibition throughout the pain neuraxis in Nf1+/− mice that could
compensate for hyperexcitability of nociceptors and prevent behavioral sensitization to
nociceptive and pruriceptive stimuli.

Previous studies suggest that there may be sex differences in the effect of Nf1
heterozygosity on pain behavior in mice. In a recent preliminary report, increased
hyperalgesia was observed in Nf1+/− females, but not Nf1+/− males, consistent with our
data29. Sex differences in pain thresholds have been previously noted, with females being
more sensitive to pain in general34. Compelling data from a recent post-hoc analysis of pain
scores from de-identified subjects found that females rate their pain higher than males in a
majority of diseases with co-morbid pain38. Furthermore, sex differences have been
observed with respect to the effects of δ-opioid receptor involvement in thermal pain and
GIRK2 involvement in pain and analgesia33. This group has also demonstrated that female
rodents are more sensitive to pruritigens than males, providing a basis for sex differences in
itch16. While there is a strong basis for sex differences in pain and itch, there are no data in
the NF1 patient population to support gender-specific increases in either pain or itch. Future
population studies using questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be
required to determine whether sex differences in pain and itch exist in the NF1 patient
population.

Our results may also highlight the importance of co-morbidities in NF1 and their role in
pain. Among other neurological complaints, individuals with NF1 have an increased
incidence of depression,22 and studies show a higher prevalence and severity of pain in
depressed patients2. Therefore, the increased effect of bodily pain on quality of life could

partially be a result of depression and not solely dependent on Nf1 heterozygosity. As a
result, future analyses should include an assessment of depression along with one of pain to
determine whether there is any correlation between these co-morbidities in NF1. In addition,
pain and itch in NF1 may be secondary effects of tumor formation, as suggested by prior
clinical studies7, 9, 14. Although these reports suggest a prominent role for tumors in
development of pain and itch in NF1, further study is necessary in order to better assess
whether tumor growth correlates with pain and itch.

In summary, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity does not
increase pain or itch behavior in mice. Coupled with previous patient studies, additional Nf1
mouse models should be employed to more completely understand the molecular and
cellular bases for the reported prevalence of pain and itch in NF1 patients.

Figure 1. Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter baseline sensitivity to thermal or mechanical stimuli
A. To assess temperature preference, mice were subjected to a gradient ranging from ~12°C
to ~47°C. Thermotaxis behavior over 2 hours was similar between WT (n=9) and Nf1+/−
(n=9) littermates. The temperature of the zone in which they spent the most time, or their
temperature preference was not different between WT (n=9) and Nf1+/− (n=9) littermates
(inset). B. Sensitivity to acute, noxious thermal stimuli in the Hargreaves’ test was similar
between WT (n=21) and Nf1+/− (n=19) littermates. C. Sensitivity to acute, noxious
mechanical stimuli in the up-down Von Frey method was not changed in the Nf1+/− (n = 6)
compared to wild-type (n = 6) littermates. D. Responses to the cooling stimulus, acetone,
were not different in either percent trials responding and total time spent responding
between WT (n = 21) and Nf1+/− (n = 26) littermates. E. Paw withdrawal latency to a
ramping cold stimulus in the cold plantar assay was similar between Nf1+/− (n = 12) and

Figure 2. Nf1 heterozygosity attenuated formalin-induced spontaneous behaviors and heat
hypersensitivity
A. Over the entire duration of the formalin test, WT (n = 6) and Nf1+/− (n = 8) littermates
exhibited a comparable time course of spontaneous nocifensive responses following a 10 μl
intraplantar injection of 2% formalin. B. Nf1+/− littermates showed decreased spontaneous
nocifensive behavior in the phase 1 (0–10 minutes), but not phase 2, (10–60 minutes),
compared to wild-type littermates (t-test; **p < 0.01). C. Similarly, formalin-induced heat
hypersensitivity was blunted in Nf1+/− (n = 7) compared to wild-type (n = 7) littermates
(RM 2-way ANOVA; main effect of genotype; *p < 0.05). At 1 day post-formalin, Nf1+/−
(n = 7) littermates showed a difference compared to their wild-type littermates on 1 day
post-formalin (two-way RM ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test; **p < 0.01). D.
Capsaicin-induced spontaneous behavior (0–5 minutes after intraplantar, subcutaneous
injection) was unchanged in Nf1+/− (n = 9) compared to wild-type (n = 7) littermates
(unpaired t-test).

Figure 4. Nf1 heterozygosity does not alter histamine-dependent or –independent scratching
behavior
A. WT (n = 4) and Nf1+/− (n = 7) littermates showed similar histamine-dependent
scratching as demonstrated by the time course of scratching following histamine (50μg/
10μl) injection into the nape of the neck. B. Potent mast cell degranulation by compound
48/80 (60μg/30μl) injection into the nape of the neck caused a similar time course of
scratching in WT (n = 9) and Nf1+/− (n = 6) littermates. C. WT (n = 4) and Nf1+/− (n = 6)
littermates exhibited a comparable time course of histamine-independent scratching induced
by chloroquine (200μg/50μl) injection into the nape of the neck.

Figure 5. Nf1 heterozygosity did not alter CCI-induced cold allodynia
A. Cold allodynia was assessed using acetone following the CCI in both WT and Nf1+/−
littermates (n = 6–11). The time course for percent of trials responding after injury did not
differ between the WT and Nf1+/− littermates. B. These WT and Nf1+/− littermates did not
differ in the time course for time spent responding to acetone stimuli after CCI (two-way
RM ANOVA).
