Background: The PAKs are effectors of Rac/cdc42.
Results: Identification of a pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent inhibitor of the group I PAKs that shows anti-tumor activity in vivo.
Conclusion: A pyridopyrimidinone provides a scaffold for development of high specificity group I PAK inhibitors.
Significance: Identification class of orally available ATP-competitive Group I PAK inhibitors with significant potential for the
treatment of NF2.

Thep21-activatedkinases(PAKs)areimmediatedownstream
effectors of the Rac/Cdc42 small G-proteins and implicated in
promoting tumorigenesis in various types of cancer including
breast and lung carcinomas. Recent studies have established a
requirement for the PAKs in the pathogenesis of Neurofibroma-
tosis type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited cancer disorder
caused by mutations at the NF2 gene locus. Merlin, the protein
product of the NF2 gene, has been shown to negatively regulate
signaling through the PAKs and the tumor suppressive func-
tions of Merlin are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition
of the PAKs. Knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 expression,
through RNAi-based approaches, impairs the proliferation of
NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and inhibits their ability
to form tumors in vivo. These data implicate the PAKs as
potential therapeutic targets. High-throughput screening of a
library of small molecules combined with a structure-activity
relationship approach resulted in the identification of FRAX597, a
small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent inhibitor of
the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the
FRAX597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that tra-
verses the gatekeeper residue and positions the thiazole in the
back cavity of the ATP binding site, a site rarely targeted by
kinase inhibitors. FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of NF2-
deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent
anti-tumor activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma develop-
ment in an orthotopic model of NF2. These studies identify a
novel class of orally available ATP-competitive Group I PAK

inhibitors with significant potential for the treatment of NF2
and other cancers.

The p21-activated kinases (PAKs)3 form a protein family of
serine/threonine kinases, divided into two sub groups, I and II.
Group I PAKs consists of three members - PAK1, PAK2, and
PAK3 that share 93–95% sequence identity within the kinase
domain and are similarly regulated by Rac/Cdc42-GTP binding
(1). The Rac and Cdc42 proteins are members of the Rho family
of small G-proteins and mediate several signaling pathways that
regulate cellular proliferation, cytoskeleton reorganization, and
gene expression (2, 3). As immediate downstream effectors of
Rac/Cdc42 and given the major roles these small G-proteins
play in tumorigenesis, the PAKs have been implicated in mul-
tiple types of cancer including breast and lung carcinomas and
neurofibromatosis (4, 5).

PAK1 has been reported to be widely overexpressed and/or
hyperactivated in various types of benign and malignant can-
cers (6). PAK1 expression is up-regulated in 40–50% of primary
breast cancers (7, 8). Expression of a constitutively active PAK1
mutant (CA-PAK1) increases cell motility, anchorage-inde-
pendent growth, and invasiveness of breast cancer cells and
leads to dissemination of metastatic mammary tumors and
other types of breast lesions in transgenic mouse models
(9–11). Conversely, inhibition of PAK1 function suppresses
cellular motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines and
inhibits pre-malignant progression in a three-dimensional cul-
ture model of breast cancer (10, 12–15). In squamous non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PAK1 expression is elevated in
64% of cases and is required for the proliferation of squamous
NSCLC cells and for tumor growth in vivo (8).

A Small Molecule Inhibitor of Group I PAKs Inhibits Tumor Growth

The PAKs play critical roles in neurofibromatosis types 1
(NF1) and 2 (NF2). NF1 and NF2 are dominantly inherited can-
cer disorders that develop mostly benign nerve sheath tumors
of the peripheral nerves (16). NF1 is quite common with a birth
incidence of 1 in 3,000 and is caused by mutations of the NF1
tumor suppressor gene that encodes a Ras GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) named Neurofibromin. Deletion/inactivation of
Neurofibromin leads to increased levels of activated GTP-
bound Ras, which activates multiple oncogenic signaling cas-
cades,
including the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Previous
studies have shown that dominant-negative PAK1 mutants effi-
ciently block Ras transformation in both transformed Schwann
cells and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells by
interfering with the activation of the MAPK cascade (17). More
recently, PAK1 has been shown to play a critical role in regulat-
ing the NF1 tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have
established that Nf1 heterozygosity in the tumor microenviron-
ment, particularly in bone marrow-derived mast cells
(BMMCs), is required to induce neurofibroma progression
(18–20). Genetic approaches involving the crossing of Pak1⫺/⫺
mice with Nf1⫹/⫺ mice have demonstrated that loss of Pak1
reversed MAPK-mediated hyperproliferation and p38-regu-
lated increased migration of Nf1 haploinsufficient BMMCs in
culture and corrected dermal accumulation of Nf1⫹/⫺ mast
cells in vivo, to levels found in wild-type mice (21).

NF2 is a dominantly inherited autosomal disease (affecting 1
in 30,000) attributed to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the
NF2 gene. Merlin, the protein encoded by the NF2 gene, has
been implicated in the regulation of a number of signaling path-
ways, including those regulated by Rac1, Ras/MAPK, mTOR,
and Hpo (22). Several lines of evidence indicate that merlin
functions as an inhibitor of Rac signaling. First, in NF2 patients,
loss of Merlin is associated with elevated levels of Rac-GTP
accompanied by abnormal PAK1 activation and the ablation of
merlin in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to PAK1 acti-
vation (23–26). Conversely, merlin overexpression in Schwann
cells suppresses PAK1 activity and prevents PAK1 and PAK2
activation by Rac through competing with Rac-GTP for PAK
binding (27–31). Importantly, previous work has established
the PAKs as bona fide targets for inhibition in NF2. Use of RNAi
approaches or specific peptide inhibitors to knockdown expres-
sion or inhibit the function of the group 1 PAKs, respectively,
has demonstrated that the PAKs are required for cell transfor-
mation and tumorigenesis, subsequent to NF2 loss of function
(25, 32). More recently a specific PAK inhibitor, IPA-3, was
shown to block PAK2 phosphorylation at Ser-192/197, which
antagonizes PAK-Pix interactions and reduces cell spreading
and adhesion (33).

Given the data implicating the group I Paks as targets in NF2
and other types of cancers, we set out to identify PAK inhibitors
to be developed as therapeutic agents. We describe the identifica-
tion of a potent new small-molecule PAK inhibitor, FRAX597,
characterize the molecular basis underlying the selectivity of this
inhibitor and its anti-proliferative activities toward Nf2-null
Schwann cells in culture and Nf2-associated schwannomas
in vivo.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Cell Culture Conditions—SC4 cells are a gift from Dr. Marco
Giovannini (House Ear Institute) and tested by PCR to confirm
the presence of the Nf2 knock-out alleles. Cells were grown in
low-glucose DME, 10% fetal calf serum, 1⫻ non-essential
amino acids and 100 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Transfec-
tions were performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen),
following manufacturer’s instructions.

Determination of Enzyme IC50 Values—IC50 values were
determined using a 10 concentration point, non-radioactive,
functional assay that employs a fluorescence-based, coupled-
enzyme format, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Z⬘-
LYTE威 biochemical assay, Invitrogen). Kinase selectivity was
determined using both the Z⬘-LYTE威 and Adapta威 kinase assay
format provided by Invitrogen.

Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared with
RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM NaF). The following antibod-
ies were used according to manufactures’ instructions: PAK1
(N-20 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-PAK1 (2606), YES1
(3201), TEK (7403), and CSF1R (3152) all from Cell Signaling,
RET (ab134100 Abcam), ␣-tubulin (AC42 Sigma), and ␤-actin
(AC40 Sigma).

Proliferation and Cell Cycle Assays—30,000 cells/well were
plated in 12-well dishes in triplicate. Cell growth media with or
without FRAX597 was replaced daily. At indicated time points,
cells from individual wells were trypsinized and counted using a
Coulter counter (Z1 series, Beckman Coulter). Statistical anal-
ysis was performed using a Student’s t test. For cell cycle anal-
ysis, cells were harvested, washed once with PBS and fixed in
cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were resuspended in propidium
iodide (PI) buffer (50 ␮g/ml PI, 250 mg/ml RNase A in PBS) and
incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Cell cycle distribution
was evaluated using Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beck-
man). Data were analyzed using WinMDI software.

In Vivo Tumor Models and Imaging—All animal experiments
were approved by the Wistar Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and performed in accordance with relevant institu-
tional and national guidelines.

Nf2⫺/⫺ SC4 Schwann cells were transduced by lentiviruses
carrying pLuc-mCherry and sorted by FACS. 5 ⫻ 104 cells were
transplanted into the sciatic nerve sheath of NOD/SCID mice
(8 weeks of age) by intraneural injection. Tumor progression
was monitored weekly by bioluminescence imaging (BLI)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an IVIS-200
system (Xenogen, San Francisco, CA).

Statistical Analysis—To assess the anti-tumor activity of
FRAX597 in vivo, the natural log-transformed flux readings
were used to reflect tumor growth. The trends of tumor growth
over time (followed up by days) were examined between control
and treatment groups using a mixed-effect model with the ran-
dom effect at the mouse level. A linear function in days was
determined to provide the best fit without random slope on
follow-up days. A likelihood ratio testing nested models (with
versus without the interaction term of group and time) was used
to examine if trends are significantly different overall between

groups. The tumor weights were first examined by a Shapiro-
Wilk test to assess data normality and a Variance ratio test was
used to examine the equality of variances between two groups.
The differences between the control and experimental cohorts
were analyzed by a t test with equal variances. Statistical analy-
ses were performed using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp LP).

Recombinant PAK1 Protein Expression, Purification, and
Mutagenesis—The DNA encoding the native kinase domain of
PAK1 (residues 249 to 545) was subcloned into the pFastBac
HTc expression vector. PAK1 V342 substitution mutants
(V342F or V342Y) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA). Recombinant protein was expressed in Sf21 cells, and cells
were harvested and lysed by sonication in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0,
500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT (lysis buffer). The lysate was
cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ni-NTA affinity col-
umn. The protein was eluted from the column with increasing
concentration of imidazole in lysis buffer (20 mM to 250 mM).
Collected protein was treated overnight with TEV protease to
cleave the His6 tag. The protein was further purified by passage
through a HiTrapQ column and a size-exclusion Superdex 200
column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 125 mM NaCl.
Purified protein was concentrated to 1.2 mg/ml and frozen for
storage. FRAX597 inhibitor potencies against wild type and
V342 mutant proteins were measured using the KinaseGlo
Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Experiments were done in duplicate in the presence of 20 nM
PAK1 and 1 ␮M ATP.

PAK1 Structure Determination—The PAK1 kinase domain
(residues 249 to 545, mutation K299R) was cloned into a pET-
TOPO vector with an N-terminal 6-His tag and expressed in
BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C
until they reached an A600 of 0.6, and protein expression was
induced by adding 1 mM IPTG and carried on fo r 6 h at 28 °C.
Protein was purified from harvested cells as described above.
Purified protein was concentrated to 9 mg/ml in a buffer con-
taining 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 125 mM NaCl and used for
crystallization.

Crystals of apo-PAK1 were obtained using hanging drop
vapor diffusion by mixing 1 ␮l of PAK1 (9 mg/ml) with 1 ␮l of
crystallization solution (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 25%
PEG 3350, 10 mM DTT) at 4 °C. Crystals were subjected to
soaking with 1 mM FRAX597 inhibitor overnight. Crystals were
cryoprotected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and yielded x-ray
diffraction t o 2 Å on aRigaku MicroMax-007HF x-ray genera-
tor equipped with Saturn 944⫹ detector. Collected data were
integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000 (34).

The PAK1 inhibitor complex structure was determined by
molecular replacement using the program PHASER with the
structure of PAK1 (249–545, K299R) in complex with ⌳-FL172
(PDB code 3FXZ) as a search model (35) with the ⌳-FL172
inhibitor removed from the search model. Iterative cycles of
refinement and manual rebuilding of the initial model were
performed using the programs REFMAC5 (36) and COOT (37),
respectively. The inhibitor models were manually fitted into the
calculated Fo⫺Fc map. The validity of each step of refinement
and rebuilding was monitored by the Rwork and Rfree (data not
shown).

RESULTS

Discovery and Characterization of FRAX597 as a Group
I PAK Inhibitor—The small molecule pyridopyrimidinone
inhibitor FRAX597 was designed through a traditional struc-
ture-activity relationship (SAR) approach starting from a dis-
tinct chemical series identified from a high throughput screen
(HTS) of a 12,000 member kinase-focused library against PAK1
(Fig. 1). Hits exhibiting ⬎50% inhibition at 10 ␮M were priori-
tized, followed up with a 7 point dose response that led to the
identification of a class of unsubstituted pyridopyrimidinones
that demonstrated moderate inhibition of group 1 and group 2
PAK. Standard medicinal chemistry SAR evaluations of the
HTS hit FRAX019 identified that 6-substitution with an aryl
group on the pyridopyrimidinone core, shown in FRAX414,
improved group 1 PAK potency while also improving group 2
PAK selectivity (Fig. 1A). Further optimization of the 6-aryl-
substituted pyridopyrimidinones led to the discovery of the
molecule FRAX597 (Fig. 1B).

FRAX597 was determined to be a potent, ATP-competitive
inhibitor of group I PAKs (PAK 1–3), with biochemical IC50
values as follows: PAK1 IC50 ⫽ 8 nM, PAK2 IC50 ⫽ 13 nM, PAK3
IC50 ⫽ 19 nM. The IC50 toward PAK4, a member of group II
PAKs was ⬎10 ␮M (Fig. 1C). To characterize the specificity of
FRAX597, the inhibitory capacity of the compound was pro-
filed against a representative panel of recombinant kinase
domains (106 of 518 known human kinases), using an assay that
monitors phosphorylation of a peptide substrate (Invitrogen
Z⬘-LYTE威 biochemical assay). At a concentration of 100 nM
FRAX597 displayed a significant (⬎80% inhibition) inhibitory
capacity toward YES1 (87%), RET (82%), CSF1R (91%), TEK
(87%), PAK1 (82%), and PAK2 (93%). FRAX597 displayed min-
imal inhibitory activity toward the group II PAKs: PAK4 (0%),
PAK6 (23%), and PAK7 (8%) (data not shown). To determine
the cellular IC50 values for FRAX597, SC4 cells (Nf2-null
Schwann cells) were treated with an escalating dose of
FRAX597. PAK1 activation requires an autophosphorylation
step and thus the activity of PAK1 was determined by Western
blot analysis using an antibody against phospho(Ser-144)-
PAK1. These studies establish an approximate IC50 of 70 nM for
FRAX597 in culture (Fig. 1D).

Structure of PAK1 in Complex with FRAX597—To identify
the molecular basis for FRAX597 inhibition of PAK1, we deter-
mined the x-ray crystal structure of the PAK1/FRAX597 com-
plex (PDB ID 4EQC and RCSB 071940). The 2-Å resolution
structure of PAK1 in complex with FRAX597 reveals a charac-
teristic protein kinase fold containing smaller N-terminal and
larger C-terminal lobes connected by a hinge region, with the
inhibitor occupying the ATP binding site as expected (Fig. 2A).
Clear and unambiguous Fo⫺Fc difference electron density con-
firms the position and orientation of the inhibitor in the ATP
binding pocket (Fig. 2B).

The pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one moiety of FRAX597 is
positioned in a fashion similar to the adenine base of ATP and
dictates the orientation of the entire compound. Although the
ring system forms two hydrogen bonds with the hinge region,
its precise hydrogen-bonding pattern is different than ATP.
While the N3 nitrogen of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one

tive enzyme). The pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one ring also
establishes extensive van der Waals interactions with the pro-
tein. Ile-276, Val-284, and Ala-297 from the N-terminal
domain, Leu-396, Thr-406, and Asp-407 from the C-terminal

a hydrophobic pocket that nicely accommodates the pyrido-
[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one moiety and phenylamino substituent at
position 2 of the inhibitor (Fig. 3A).

Structural Basis for FRAX597 Potency and Selectivity toward
Group I PAKs—To compare the binding mode of FRAX597 to
other potent PAK1 inhibitors, we superimposed the structure
of the PAK1/FRAX597 complex with PAK1 bound to two
organometallic inhibitors, FL172 (38) and Ru-phthalimide (39).
Although all three inhibitors target the ATP binding site and
mimic ATP binding, there is one striking difference; the
2-chloro-4-(thiazol-5-yl)phenyl moiety of FRAX597 occupies a
part of the active site that is not sampled by the other inhibitors
(Fig. 4A). Specifically, the 2-chloro-phenyl ring very efficiently
traverses the Met-344 gatekeeper residue, and positions the
thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site (Fig. 3B).

FRAX597 shows significant isoform selectivity within the
PAK family, targeting only group I PAKs. To understand the
molecular basis for this specificity, we superimposed the PAK1/
FRAX597 structure with the structure of PAK4 in complex with
CGP74514A, a selective inhibitor of group 2 PAKs (Fig. 4B)
(40). This superposition reveals that although the architecture
of the ATP binding pockets shows similarities between the two
kinases, the back cavity of PAK4 is much more constricted than
in PAK1. This increased constriction in PAK4 is largely medi-
ated by gatekeeper residue Met-395 and Lys-350 of PAK4
which are in distinctly different conformations than the corre-
sponding residues in PAK1. This would result in a steric clash in
PAK4 when a large group such as the 2-chloro-4-(thiazol-5-
yl)phenyl of the FRAX597 inhibitor is present. Based on this

The C6 substituent of the inhibitor, 2-chloro-4-(thiazol-5-
yl)phenyl, penetrates deeply into the back cavity of the ATP
binding site. The aromatic ring of the chlorophenyl moiety is
nicely placed between the hydrophobic side chains of the Met-
344 gatekeeper residue and the aliphatic carbons of Arg-299
(Fig. 3B), allowing the thiazole group to protrude into the back
cavity of the ATP binding site formed by Glu-315, Ile-316, and
Val-342 (Fig. 3C).

In contrast to the rest of the inhibitor that makes extensive
interactions with the protein, the methyl-piperazine ligand
points out of the ATP binding pocket toward where the protein
substrate would bind. The entire group is solvent exposed with
no apparent interactions with the protein (Figs. 2A and 3A).
This is in agreement with the observation that very weak elec-
tron density is observed for this group in the structure (Fig. 2B),
suggesting possible flexibility of this region of the inhibitor
when bound to PAK1 (Fig. 3A).

observation, it is not surprising that a 100 nM concentration of
FRAX597 does not show detectable inhibition against PAK4,
while the same compound concentration inhibits more than
80% of PAK1 activity (data not shown).

To test the hypothesis that the size and accessibility of the
back cavity could be an important determinant for FRAX597
selectivity toward PAK1 we mutated the Val-342 in the back
cavity into phenylalanine (V342F) and tyrosine (V342Y), with
the expectation that the bulky side chains would sterically
interfere with the thiazole of the 2-chloro-phenyl and reduce
inhibition of PAK1 by FRAX597. As expected the V342F and
V342Y PAK1 mutants were less sensitive to FRAX597 inhibi-
tion and displayed significantly higher IC50 values. When mea-
sured using the Kinase Glo Assay in the presence of 20 nM
protein and 1 ␮M ATP, FRAX597 displayed an IC50 value of 48
nM against wild type PAK1, while IC50 values against the V342F
and V342Y PAK1 mutants were higher than 3 ␮M and 2 ␮M,
respectively (Fig. 3D). Importantly, the purified mutant pro-
teins behaved similarly to the wild type protein during purifica-
tion and displayed similar overall kinase activities as deter-
mined by in vitro kinases assays (not shown).

Finally, the finding that the accessibility of the back cavity is a
critical determinant of FRAX597 selectivity is further demon-
strated when the PAK1/FRAX597 structure is superimposed
with the receptor tyrosine kinase RET (Rearranged During
Transfection) (41). RET is one of the few receptor tyrosine
kinases that are targeted by FRAX597 with similar potency as
PAK1 (data not shown). This superimposition demonstrates
that the small Val-804 gatekeeper residue in RET allows access
to the back cavity, likely allowing the RET active site to accom-
modate the 2-chloro-4-(thiazol-5-yl)phenyl group of FRAX597

(Fig. 4C). However, the C helix of RET is rotated into the back
cavity more than it is in PAK1, serving to further constrict the
back of the pocket in RET relative to PAK1 (Fig. 4D). Although
RET could accommodate the thiazole substituent of FRAX597,
we hypothesize that larger substituents would not be accom-
modated in RET. Interestingly, out of three additional receptor
tyrosine kinases inhibited by FRAX597 with similar potency as
RET, two have small threonine residues as the gatekeeper resi-
due (YES1 and CSF1R) while one has a medium sized isoleucine
(TEK) (data not shown), suggesting that they also accommo-
date FRAX597 in a similar fashion as RET.

FRAX597 Inhibits Schwannoma Cell Proliferation in Vitro
and Tumor Formation in Vivo—To assess if FRAX597 can
inhibit proliferation of transformed Schwann cells, Nf2-null
SC4 Schwann cells were treated with the inhibitor, and cell
numbers were followed over a period of 96 h. As shown in Fig.
5A, FRAX597 treatment dramatically impaired cellular prolif-
eration. Propidium iodide and FACS analysis confirmed cell
cycle arrest in G1, as evidenced by accumulation of FRAX597-
treated cells in G1 phase (74% versus 50% in control-treated
cells) and decrease in the fraction of cells in S phase (12% versus
27% in control) and G2/M phase (11% versus 22% in control).
The absence of a sub-G1 population in treated cells suggests
that FRAX597 does not impact cell viability (Fig. 5B). To deter-
mine if FRAX597 can inhibit tumor growth in vivo, we
employed an orthotopic model of NF2 that recapitulates the
tumor microenvironment of schwannomas, by injection of
luciferase-tagged NF2-null schwannoma cells into a myelinated
nerve (42, 43). Tumor progression was monitored twice weekly
by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and total flux counts were

recorded for each animal. Ten days postinjection, similar flux
readings for all animals were validated, and animals were
enrolled randomly into control (vehicle only) or drug-treated
cohorts (100 mg/kg, oral, once daily) for a period of 14 days.
Analysis of the flux reading for the animals in the two cohorts
demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate in
FRAX597-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 5B).
After 14 days of treatment the animals were sacrificed and the
tumors excised and weighed. FRAX597-treated cohort showed
significantly lower average tumor weight compared with the
control cohort (0.55gr versus 1.87gr, p ⫽ 0.0001). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that FRAX597 has a signifi-
cant anti-proliferative activity against Nf2-null Schwann cells in
vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo.

The Inhibition of Group I PAKs Mediates FRAX597 Inhibition
of Schwannoma Cell Proliferation—To further characterize the
targets through which FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of
NF2-null Schwann cells, we assessed the expression level of the
other kinases toward which FRAX597 displayed a significant
inhibitory capacity (YES1, TEK, CSF1R, and RET) in SC4 cells.
We find these kinases are not expressed, or below levels of
detection, in these cells (Fig. 6A), thus suggesting it is unlikely
the effects of FRAX597 on SC4 cell growth are mediated
through inhibition of these targets.

In addition, we employed another PAK inhibitor from Pfizer
(PF-3758309), which potently suppresses both group I (PAK1,
PAK2, and PAK3) and II (PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6) PAKs (44).
Importantly, while both FRAX597 and PF-3758309 display
some limited off-target effects on other kinases, these off-target
effects are largely non-overlapping (45). In assessing the effects
on SC4 cell growth, PF-3758309 treatment resulted in a similar
inhibition of cell proliferation as exhibited by FRAX597 treat-
ment (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the effects of
FRAX597 seen in Nf2-null Schwann cells are mediated through
inhibition of the group I PAKs.

DISCUSSION

The identification of FRAX597 as a potent inhibitor of group
I PAKs has allowed us to assess the consequences of PAK inhi-
bition on tumor development in an orthotopic model of NF2
that closely reflects the human disease. Consistent with our
previous studies demonstrating that group I PAKs are critical
effectors of merlin’s tumor suppressive functions, we find that
by inhibiting PAKs we are able to inhibit the proliferation of
Nf2-null Schwann cells in culture and growth of NF2-associ-
ated schwannomas in vivo. While the possibility that part of the
anti-tumor effects of FRAX597 can be attributed to targets
other than the PAKs cannot be excluded, we find that other
FRAX597 targets are not expressed in SC4 cells. Finally, treat-
ment of SC4 cells with another PAK inhibitor (PF-3758309),
which has off-target effects that are largely non-overlapping
with FRAX597, recapitulates the effects of FRAX597 on SC4
cells. These combined findings strengthen the notion that the
effects of FRAX597 inhibition are mediated through the inhi-
bition of the group I PAKs.

Although relatively poorly conserved among different
kinases, the back cavity of the ATP binding site is rarely tar-
geted by kinase inhibitors. This cavity is typically hydrophobic
and its accessibility depends on the size and position of the
gatekeeper residue. For example, the BRAF and CDK2 kinases
have small (Thr) and large (Phe) gatekeeper residues, respec-
tively, allowing BRAF to have a larger cavity in this area creating
what is known as a BRAF specificity pocket (46), while this
region is essentially blocked off in CDK2 (47). In PAK1, the
position of the Met-344 gatekeeper residue and the C-helix cre-
ate a relatively large back cavity capable of accommodating the
large 2-chloro-4-(thiazol-5-yl)phenyl moiety attached to the
C6 position of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one ring system.
Interestingly, some pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one derivatives
were previously described as potent cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) inhibitors (47, 48). Some of them also contained a

methyl-piperazine phenylamino substituent at the C2 position
of the same pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one ring system as
FRAX597 (Fig. 2A). However, CDKs were found unable to
accommodate large substituents at the C6 position (data not
shown), consistent with the larger Phe gatekeeper residue in
CDKs (49). Based on this observation, it is not surprising that
FRAX597 exhibits no detectable potency against CDKs. The
importance of the back pocket of the ATP binding site for PAK1
inhibition, and for inhibition by FRAX597 in particular, is fur-
ther supported by the mutational sensitivity of Val-342 for
inhibitor potency. This further highlights the importance of
elaboration of the FRAX597 thiazole group for increasing
PAK1 inhibitor potency and selectivity. In addition, elaboration
of the methylpiperazine moiety on the opposite end of the
FRAX597 inhibitor could provide additional opportunity to
probe the protein substrate-binding site of PAK1.

Identification of this highly-selective group I PAK inhibitor
and its ability to inhibit the proliferation of Nf2-null Schwann
cells in culture and growth of NF2-associated schwannomas in
vivo establish the group I PAKs as targets for the development
of therapeutics. Determination of the PAK1/FRAX597 struc-
ture will guide further improvements of inhibitor potency and
selectivity and provide opportunity to develop drugs for Neu-
rofibromatosis type 2, a disease for which there are no approved
therapeutics.
