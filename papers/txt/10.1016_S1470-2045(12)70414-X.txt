Summary
Background  Plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas  are  slow-growing  chemoradiotherapy-resistant  tumours  arising  in  patients 
with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 (NF1). Currently, there are no viable therapeutic options for patients with plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas that cannot be surgically removed because of their proximity to vital body structures. We undertook an 
open-label phase 2 trial to test whether treatment with imatinib mesylate can decrease the volume burden of clinically 
signiﬁ cant plexiform neuroﬁ bromas in patients with NF1.

Methods  Eligible  patients  had  to  be  aged  3–65  years,  and  to  have  NF1  and  a  clinically  signiﬁ cant  plexiform 
neuroﬁ broma. Patients were treated with daily oral imatinib mesylate at 220 mg/m² twice a day for children and 
400 mg twice a day for adults for 6 months. The primary endpoint was a 20% or more reduction in plexiform size by 
sequential volumetric MRI imaging. Clinical data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; a secondary analysis 
was  also  done  for  those  patients  able  to  take  imatinib  mesylate  for  6  months.  This  trial  is  registered  with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01673009.

Findings Six of 36 patients (17%, 95% CI 6–33), enrolled on an intention-to-treat basis, had an objective response to 
imatinib mesylate, with a 20% or more decrease in tumour volume. Of the 23 patients who received imatinib mesylate 
for at least 6 months, six (26%, 95% CI 10–48) had a 20% or more decrease in volume of one or more plexiform 
tumours. The most common adverse events were skin rash (ﬁ ve patients) and oedema with weight gain (six). More 
serious  adverse  events  included  reversible  grade  3  neutropenia  (two),  grade  4  hyperglycaemia  (one),  and  grade  4 
increases in aminotransferase concentrations (one).

Interpretation Imatinib mesylate could be used to treat plexiform neuroﬁ bromas in patients with NF1. A multi-institutional 
clinical trial is warranted to conﬁ rm these results.

Introduction
Neuroﬁ bromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is  the  most  common 
human genetic cancer predisposition syndrome, causing 
substantial  morbidity  and  mortality  in  roughly  one  in 
3000  individuals.1,2  The  disorder  results  from  autosomal 
dominant mutations in the NF1 tumour suppressor gene 
that  encodes  a  Ras  GTPase  named  neuroﬁ bromin.3 
Deﬁ ciency  of  neuroﬁ bromin  leads  to  hyperactivation  of 
the Ras signalling cascade and other signal transduction 
networks.4,5  In  around  40%  of  patients  with  NF1,6  the 
aberrations  in  these  cellular  signalling  networks  cul-
minate in development of tumours known as plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas, which occur as multiple primary tumours, 
each  with  their  own  growth  characteristics.  They  arise 
from loss of heterozygosity in individual Schwann cells in 
almost  any  anatomical  location  where  Schwann  cells 
reside.  These  locally  invasive  tumours  can  be  painful, 
disﬁ guring, and life-threatening when local ised near vital 
structures such as upper airway or major nerves and blood 
vessels.7,8  Due  to  their  slow-growing  nature,  plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas  are  highly  refractory  to  radiotherapy  and 
chemotherapy, and surgery is often extremely challenging 

because of localisation of these tumours.7 In view of the 
limited  viable  treatment  options,  there  is  an  urgent 
medical  need  for  novel  therapeutic  approaches  to  allow 
successful management of plexiform neuroﬁ bromas.

The kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate reduces tumour 
size of plexiform neuroﬁ bromas in a preclinical mouse 
model of NF1 that fully recapitulates the develop ment of 
plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas  detected  in  patients  with 
NF1.9,10 Mechanistically, this eﬀ ect is attributed at least in 
part to targeting cellular phospho-signalling cascades in 
the tumour microenvironment.8,11 On the basis of these 
ﬁ ndings, we administered imatinib mesylate (350 mg/m² 
per day) to a patient with NF1 with life-threatening airway 
compression by a plexiform neuroﬁ broma, and achieved 
a  greater  than  50%  re duction  in  tumour  size  within 
3 months of therapy, resulting in substantial symptomatic 
relief.8 To build on these ﬁ ndings and establish whether 
imatinib  mesylate  could  decrease 
the  volume  of 
individual  plexiform  neuro ﬁ bromas  in  other  patients 
with NF1, we undertook a phase 2 open-label trial of this 
oral small-molecule kinase inhibitor in patients with NF1 
and clinically signiﬁ cant plexiform neuroﬁ bromas.

and  400  mg  twice  a  day  for  adults  (dosing  at  the 
maximum  tolerated  dose  per  recommendations  by 
study  drug  manufacturer).  Patients  returned  to  clinic 
for  follow-up  visits  including  review  of  symptoms, 
physical examination, complete blood count, and serum 
chemistries weekly for 2 weeks, then every other week 
for  2  weeks,  then  monthly   for  1  month,  then  every 
3 months  thereafter (ﬁ gure 1), or as clinically indicated. 
Follow-up MRI tumour measure ments were done after 
2  months  of  treatment,  then  at  6  months,  1  year,  and 
yearly 
follow-up 
correlative  tumour  marker  studies  were  obtained  at 
study  enrolment  and  6  months  after  begin ning  the 
study  drug  and  stored  for  future  analysis.  Treatment 
with  imatinib  mesylate  was  continued  for  6  months 
with an option to continue as long as the patient showed 
beneﬁ t  from  the  study  drug  and  there  were  no  safety 
concerns.  Major  criteria  for  discon tinuation  of  study 
drug included: evidence of clinically and radiologically 
progressive  disease;  patient’s  or  par ent’s  request;  and 
adverse  eﬀ ects  requiring  removal  from  study.  Daily 
diaries  were  kept  by  patients  or  parents  to  monitor 
compliance  and  toxicities.  In  view  of  the  variation  of 
symptoms in patients and absence of a validated quality-
of-life instrument for neuroﬁ broma tosis, no quantitative 
assessment  was  done  beyond  the  patient’s  subjective 
impression.

Total  body  MRI  with  STIR,  which  suppresses  fat 
signal  and  accentuates  the  water  signal,  was  used  for 
imaging  at  recruitment  and  throughout  the  trial. 
Neuroﬁ bromas  typically  show  hyperintense  signal  on 
T2  weighted  imaging.  With  fat  suppression,  STIR  is 
able  to  easily  diﬀ erentiate  neuroﬁ bromas  from  sur-
rounding  tissue  without  the  addition  of  intravenous 
gadolinium.  All  imaging  was  done  on  a  1·5  T  clinical 
MRI  (Magnetom  Avanto,  Siemens  Medical  Solutions, 
Malvern,  PA,  USA)  in  the  coronal  and  axial  planes  at 
4  mm  gapless  slice  thickness.  Criteria  for  selection  of

Methods
Patients
Patients  were  recruited  from  the  Indiana  University 
School 
of  Medicine  Neuroﬁ bromatosis  Clinic, 
Indianapolis, IN, USA, and the Neuroﬁ bromatosis Clinic 
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center/
Children’s  Medical  Center,  Dallas,  TX,  USA,  or  by  self-
referral. Patient entry criteria included: age of 3–65 years; 
clinical  diagnosis  of  NF1;  and  presence  of  clinically 
signiﬁ cant  plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas  deﬁ ned  as  poten-
tially  life-threatening  tumours,  tumours  impinging  on 
vital  structures,  or  tumours  that  signiﬁ cantly  impair 
patients’  quality  of  life  from  a  subjective  standpoint 
because of pain or other symptoms (eg, dyspnoea, urinary 
dysfunction,  and  weakness,  dependent  on  location  of 
individual  plexiform  tumours).  Furthermore,  patients 
must have had at least one plexiform neuro ﬁ broma that 
could  be  measured  by  MRI  (at  least  10  mm  in  largest 
dimensions) to allow objective measurements of tumour 
response  to  treatment.  Eligible  patients  needed  to  have 
had a life expectancy of more than 2 months, Karnofsky12 
or  Lansky13  performance  score  of  80%  or  more,  and 
adequate  end-organ  function  (deﬁ ned  as  total  bilirubin 
concentration  <1·5 × upper 
[ULN], 
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 
<2·5 × ULN,  creatinine  <1·5 × ULN,  absolute  neutrophil 
count >1·5 × 10⁹/L, and platelets >100 × 10⁹/L). Women of 
childbearing  potential  had  to  have  had  a  negative 
pregnancy test within 7 days before study enrolment, and 
men  and  women  had  to  agree  to  use  a  barrier  birth-
control method during the study and for 3 months after 
discontinuation of study drug.

limit  of  normal 

Key exclusion criteria were: exposure to chemotherapy 
or any other investigational agents within 28 days before 
enrolment on study; history of another malignancy with-
in  5  years;  known  brain  metastases;  New  York  Heart 
Association  Criteria  for  class  III  or  IV  heart  failure;14 
other uncontrolled medical disease; pregnancy or breast-
feeding;  HIV  infection;  history  of  radiation  to  25%  or 
more of bone marrow space; history of a major surgery 
within 2 weeks before study entry; and signiﬁ cant con-
cern for medical non-compliance.

The protocol was approved by the institutional review 
boards  at  Indiana  University  School  of  Medicine  and 
the  University  of  Texas  Southwestern-Medical  School, 
Dallas, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all patients.

Procedures
On  conﬁ rmation  of  eligibility  and  study  recruitment, 
patients  were  imaged  with  MRI  short  tau  inversion 
recovery  (STIR)  imaging  to  measure  baseline  tumour 
size  (ﬁ gure  1).  Plasma  specimens  for  future  baseline 
tumour  biomarker  measurements  were  obtained  in 
addition  to  routine  laboratory  tests.  Imatinib  mesylate 
(Novartis,  East  Hanover,  NJ,  USA)  was  administered 
orally at the dose of 220 mg/m² twice a day for children

trials 

by  the  MRI  slice  thickness  to  calculate  the  tumour 
volume.15,16  Indi vidual  plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas  were 
measured  with  the  same  technique  across  sequential 
scans, matching anatomical features of the tumour and 
surrounding  structures  from  scan  to  scan.  Consistent 
with  previous  clinical 
in  neuroﬁ bromatosis 
tumours,17–19,23 response was deﬁ ned as a sustained 20% or 
more reduction in tumour volume from baseline in two 
or  more  sequential  MRIs,  including  the  MRI  at  the 
conclusion of the study protocol. Progression was deﬁ ned 
as  a  20%  or  more  increase  in  tumour  volume,  and 
tumours  that  showed  less  than  20%  reduction  and  less 
than 20% increase in volume were categorised as stable. 
Since  there  has  so  far  been  no  eﬀ ective  therapy  for 
plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas,  and  taking  into  account  the 
presence  of  multiple  individual  tumours,  our  primary 
goal  was  to  establish  whether  any  individual  plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas  could  respond  to  imatinib  mesylate. 
Inherent  in  that  endpoint  is  the  recognition  that  with 
individual  tumour  growth  qualities  and  molecular 
evolution, some plexiform neuroﬁ bromas might respond, 
whereas others might remain stable or continue to grow.
Adverse  events  were  graded  according  to  the  National 
Cancer 
Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria 
(version 3.0). Imatinib mesylate dose modiﬁ cations were 
allowed for grade 3 and 4 adverse eﬀ ects and for grade 2 
skin rash deemed to be due to the study drug. The principal 
investigator was required to notify the institutional review 
board, US Food and Drug Administration, and study drug 
manufacturer about occurrence of serious adverse eﬀ ects 
within 3 working days.

study  population  of  patients  who  received  imatinib 
mesylate for at least 6 months, six (26%; 95% CI 10–48) 
had a 20% or greater decrease in volume of one or more 
plexiform  tumours  (ﬁ gure  2).  In  these  23  evaluable 
patients, 69 plexiforms were assessed, with an average of 
three plexiforms per patient. To adjust for clustering that 
might  occur  within  individual  patients,  an  analysis  was 
done  for  correlated  binary  outcome.  The  diﬀ erence  was 
not signiﬁ cant between adult and paediatric patients (odds 
ratio  1·12,  95%  CI  0·19–6·5;  p=0·89).  When  we 
considered individual tumours in the evaluable patients, 
eight (12%, 95% CI 5–21) of 69 tumours were reduced in 
volume  by  20–38%  (median  26·5%,  IQR  25–29·5)  after 
treatment with imatinib mesylate (ﬁ gure 2). The median

20%  or  more  decrease  in  tumour  volume.  Clinical  data 
were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis by calculating 
95% CIs for the response rate. To gain a better sense of the 
activity  of  the  study  drug  on  plexiform  neuroﬁ bromas, 
given  that  some  patients  withdrew  from  study,  we  did  a 
secondary  analysis  in  the  23  patients  who  completed 
6 months of treatment with imatinib mesylate. To gain a 
better sense of the activity of the study drug on plexiform 
neuroﬁ bormas,  we  did  a  secondary  analysis  in  the 
23  patients  who  completed  6  months  of  treatment  with 
imatinib mesylate. Again, 95% CIs were calculated for the 
response  rate  to  imatinib  mesylate  producing  a  20%  or 
more  decrease  in  tumour  volume.  The  prespeciﬁ ed 
secondary outcomes were to assess safety and tolerability 
of imatinib mesylate in NF1 patients with plexiform neuro-
ﬁ bromas. R, version 2.14.1, was used for statistical analyses.
The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 

NCT01673009.

Role of the funding source
The sponsor of the study had no role in the study design, 
data  collection,  data  analysis,  data  interpretation,  or 
writing  of  the  study  report.  The  corresponding  author 
had full access to all the data in the study and had ﬁ nal 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results
Between June 1, 2006, and March 30, 2009, 36 patients 
were enrolled (table 1), three patients from the University 
of Texas Southwestern and 33 from Indiana University. 
Of the 36 patients enrolled (19 male and 17 female), the 
median age was 13 years (IQR 7·5–23; table 1). The study 
group  included  patients  within  the  age  range  of 
3–52  years;  most  patients  (n=17)  were  children  and 
adolescents  (table  1).  The  localisation  of  plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas  varied,  with  almost  half  of  the  tumours 
localised in the head and neck region (table 1). 23 (64%) 
patients  completed  6  months  of  study  drug  and  were 
evaluable; their median age was 11 years (IQR 8–19). The 
remaining  13  patients  withdrew 
the  study 
prematurely  (table  2).  Speciﬁ cally,  nine  patients  elected 
to discontinue the study drug before 6 months because 
of minor problems with taking study drug or drug side-
eﬀ ects  largely  a  result  of  dosing  at  the  maximum 
tolerated dose. Two patients discontinued the study drug 
because  of  their  local  physician’s  concern  for  tumour 
progression that could not be veriﬁ ed objectively because 
of  CT/MRI  scan  incompatibility.  Finally,  two  patients 
discontinued  the  study  drug  because  one  underwent 
tumour resection and the other had plexiforms too small 
to be measured volumetrically. One of the study patients 
is still receiving imatinib mesylate.

Table 3: Plexiform neuroﬁ broma response by age, location, and 
plexiform size

was 4 months (IQR 2–6) in children and 8 months (IQR 
6–12)  in  adults.  However,  with  the  small  numbers  of 
patients  treated  in  this  trial,  this  diﬀ erence  was  not 
signiﬁ cant (p=0·83, log-rank test for correlated data).

We  noted  heterogeneity  in  response  for  diﬀ erent 
tumours  within  individual  patients.  19  evaluable  pa-
tients had multiple measurable tumours, with 12 (63%) 
of  these  patients  showing  a  heterogeneous  response 
(a mix of responsive, stable, or progressive plexiforms), 
which  probably  results  from  the  biology  of  plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas  arising  as  genetically  distinct  primary 
tumours.  When  the  data  were  analysed  with  respect  to 
age, tumour location, and size (table 3), we recorded no 
signiﬁ cant  diﬀ erences.  However,  we  noted  that  larger 
tumours tended to be less responsive (perhaps indicating 
diﬃ  culty in drug delivery into large solid tumours), and 
that  head  and  neck  tumours  seemed  to  be  more 
responsive than plexiforms localised in other body parts 
across age groups.

Seven  evaluable  study  patients  (30%)  reported  sub-
jective  improvement  in  disease  symptoms,  including 
improved  dyspnoea  noted  at  ear,  nose,  and  throat 
evaluation and resolution of snoring or disruptive sleep 
pattern, improved bladder control as evidenced by loss of 
need  for  self-catheterisation,  and  decreased  pain  and 
improved  sensory  or  motor  symptoms  in  two  patients. 
Speciﬁ cally,  one  patient  with  cervical-cord  involvement 
had  a  decrease  in  pain  and  tingling  of  the  hands  with 
improved grip strength, and another patient with lumbar 
cord  plexiforms  had  improved  leg  strength,  which 
allowed him to walk unassisted.

19  of  36  enrolled  patients  needed  dose  reductions  or 
interruptions  because  of  treatment-related  side-eﬀ ects.

Table 4: Adverse events, by grade

The  most  common  adverse  eﬀ ects  in  the  total  study 
intention-to-treat population were skin rash and oe dema 
(table 4). Other adverse events included reversible grade 
3  neutropenia,  weight  gain,  and  grade  4  elevation  of 
aminotransferase  concentrations.  One  patient  died 
during  the  study.  This  patient  had  a  known  seizure 
disorder  with  an  upper  respiratory  infection,  during 
which the study drug was held. The patient had a seizure 
leading to airway obstruction and aspiration. The death 
was believed to be unrelated to the study treatment.

Discussion
Findings from this open-label phase 2 trial suggest that 
high-dose oral imatinib mesylate may have a role in the 
treatment  of  clinically  signiﬁ cant  plexiform  neuro-
ﬁ bromas in children and adults with NF1 (panel). To our 
knowledge,  this  is  the  ﬁ rst  successful  reduction  in 
volume of plexiform neuroﬁ bromas using targeted oral 
chemotherapy.

We noted objective responses to imatinib mesylate in 
26% of the evaluable patients enrolled in the study. The 
rationale  for  presentation  of  the  data  in  terms  of 
evaluable  patients  is  based  on  our  observations  that 
most  patients  who  came  oﬀ   study  did  so  because  of 
issues related to compliance, and they did not take the 
drug  long  enough  to  test  the  biological  eﬀ ect.  The 
reasons for poor compliance relate to the biology of the 
tumour and the initial dosing of drug. Overwhelmingly, 
plexiform tumours are slow growing, and consequently 
many  patients  have  been  living  with  them  for  many 
years.  Thus,  unlike  patients  with  highly  malignant 
tumours who are tolerant of at least some side-eﬀ ects, 
patients with plexiform neuroﬁ bromas have a very low 
threshold  for  any  drug-related  discomfort.  The  initial 
choice  for  dosing  of  drug  also  contributed  to  the  poor 
compliance.  Given  that  there  are  no  known  active  or 
eﬀ ective  agents  for  plexiforms,  we  decided  that  initial 
dosing would be at the previously established maximal 
tolerated dose to see whether imatinib was active for any 
plexiforms.  Collectively,  these  factors  result  in  a  high 
likelihood  of  having  minor  and  major  side-eﬀ ects  in 
a  population  of  patients  that  would  not  tolerate

side-eﬀ ects. This resulted in refusal to take the drug and 
compliance issues (nine of the 13 patients who came oﬀ  
study).  In  fact,  because  taking  the  study  drug  was 
problematic  for  these  patients,  we  have  substantially 
modiﬁ ed the dosing regimen in the ongoing follow-up 
trial  (NCT01140360).  In  that  study,  imatinib  is  taken 
orally  with  a  starting  dose  of  100  mg  twice  a  day  for 
patients with a body surface area (BSA) greater than or 
equal  to  1·8  m²  or  55  mg/m²  twice  daily  for  patients 
with a BSA of less than 1·8 m².  For patients with a BSA 
of at least 1·8 m², the dose is increased by increments of 
100  mg  twice  a  day  every  2  weeks  as  tolerated  up  to  a 
maximum dose of 400 mg twice a day.  For patients with 
a  BSA  of  less  than  1·8  m²  the  dose  is  increased  by 
increments of 55 mg/m² twice a day every 2 weeks as 
tolerated up to a maximum dose of 220 mg/m² twice a 
day,  with  improvement  in  drug  tolerability  recorded 
(unpublished  data).  Of  the  other  four  patients  who 
discontinued treatment, one came oﬀ  study after what 
seemed  to  be  an  early  response,  because  the  parents 
saw  an  opportunity  to  resect  the  tumour.  A  second 
individual  was  excluded  from  the  study  because  the 
tumours  were  too  small  to  measure  volumetrically. 
Furthermore, two patients withdrew early in the course 
because  of  referring  physicians’  concerns  for  tumour 
progression,  although  these  concerns  were  not  con-
ﬁ rmed  by  CT/MRI  scans  (table  2).  At  the  individual 
tumour level, 12% shrank by 20–38% in volume. Natural 
history  studies  of  untreated  patients  with  NF1  report 
that plexiform tumours never regress, but rather display 
variable progressive growth17 documented by continued 
slow increase in tumour volume over time.17 By contrast 
with  previous  data,  we  noted  a  profound  response 
(≥20% decrease in tumour volume) to the study drug in 
a subset of tumours, some of which reduced in volume 
by almost 40% with a median reduction of 26·5% (IQR 
25–29·5).  Furthermore,  a  large  subset  of  tumours  in 
evaluable  patients  had  a  decrease  in  tumour  volume 
compared with historical controls, but less than the 20% 
threshold (ﬁ gure 2). Importantly, tumour response was 
associated  with  substantial  subjective  improvement  of 
symptoms  reported  by  patients,  including  in  some 
patients  in  whom  tumours  were  reduced  by  less  than 
the 20% threshold. In several cases, the observed clinical 
improvement  was  remarkable,  including  better  airway 
patency, regained bladder control, and improved lower 
extremity motor symptoms. The response of plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas to imatinib might partly be due to cells 
expressing the c-kit receptor in the tumour microenvir-
onment as characterised in the pre-clinical model.8

The disease response to the study drug varied not only 
between patients, but also between diﬀ erent tumours in 
individual patients. Additionally, the median time to the 
ﬁ rst measurable response in paediatric patients tended 
to  be  shorter  than  in  adult  patients.  This  observation 
could  open  new  insights  into  the  understanding  of 
and 
pathobiology 

of  plexiform  neuro ﬁ bromas, 

Panel: Research in context

Systematic review
We searched PubMed for all publications in 2000–12, 
including clinical trials, meta-analysis, and reviews, with the 
terms “neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1”, and “plexiform”. We 
identiﬁ ed three clinical trials of therapies for 
neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform tumours including 
a phase 1 trial of tipifarnib (Johnson & Johnson, Beerse, 
Belgium)19 without objective response, and a phase 1 trial of 
pirfenidone (Solanan, Dallas, USA)18 without objective 
response using volumetric measures to detect 20% reduction 
as the response threshold. Finally, a phase 1 trial of pegylated 
interferon-alpha-2b20 in paediatric NF1 patients with 
plexiform neuroﬁ bromas showed tumour reduction in ﬁ ve of 
17 patients that were assessed by volumetric measurements 
of the tumour, but only one individual had a tumour response 
that was larger than 20%.

Interpretation
Our ﬁ ndings show radiographic volumetric tumour reduction 
in response to medical therapy in patients with NF1 plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas with the use of imatinib mesylate. The 
ﬁ ndings in this study provide the ﬁ rst evidence of an eﬀ ective 
therapy for a subgroup of NF1-related plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas and a validation of the published response of 
plexiform neuroﬁ bromas to imatinib in a genetic mouse 
model,8 which puts in place a translational model whereby 
other drugs can be screened for activity against plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas in the genetic NF1 mouse model before 
moving into clinical trials.

potentially  unravel  novel  therapeutic  targets.  We  are 
actively  pursuing  these  hypotheses  using  a  systems-
biology  approach,  since  the  ﬁ ndings  might  facilitate 
customised  treatment  and  screening  pro grammes  in 
patients with this common genetic disorder.

Our  study  has  limitations,  which  include  the  small 
sample  size  and  signiﬁ cant  heterogeneity  of  patient 
population  with  respect  to  age,  tumour  location,  and 
disease  extent.  This  pilot  study  takes  a  necessary  step 
towards development of eﬀ ective therapeutic strategies 
for NF1-related plexiform neuroﬁ bromas by addressing 
whether  individual  tumours  can  respond  to  targeted 
therapy.  The  inclusion  criteria  were  purposefully  kept 
very broad and inclusive to establish whether imatinib 
mesylate showed any activity without restriction of entry 
criteria other than having NF1 and a clinically signiﬁ cant 
plexiform neuroﬁ broma within the speciﬁ ed age limita-
tions (age 3–65 years). A large-scale, multi-institutional 
non-placebo phase 3 clinical trial is needed to conﬁ rm 
the results of this pilot study with more open eligibility 
criteria  that  avoid  the  limitations  of  smaller  scale 
phase 2 trials. A placebo-controlled phase 3 trial would 
be uneth ical since this report establishes the activity of 
imatinib  mesylate  against  a  fraction  of  plexiform 
neuroﬁ bromas  and  there  are  no  other  treatments

available. On the basis of the data in this trial, we believe 
a  minimum  of  1  year  of  assessment  on  treatment  is 
important  to  allow  patients  to  show  responsiveness. 
Finally,  many  study  patients  reported  subjective 
improvement of quality of life or clinical symptoms that 
frequently  (but  not  always)  correlate  with  tumour 
response  as  evidenced  by  se quential  MRIs.  We  are 
developing questionnaires and other study methods to 
allow quantiﬁ cation of subjective clinical improvement 
and  address  potential  placebo  eﬀ ects  in  future  clinical 
trials in this patient population.
