Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that predisposes affected 
individuals to tumours. The NF1 gene encodes a RAS GTPase-activating protein called 
neurofibromin and is one of several genes that (when mutant) affect RAS–MAPK signalling, 
causing related diseases collectively known as RASopathies. Several RASopathies, beyond NF1, 
are cancer predisposition syndromes. Somatic NF1 mutations also occur in 5–10% of human 
sporadic cancers and may contribute to resistance to therapy. To highlight areas for investigation in 
RASopathies and sporadic tumours with NF1 mutations, we summarize current knowledge of NF1 
disease, the NF1 gene and neurofibromin, neurofibromin signalling pathways and recent 
developments in NF1 therapeutics.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database 
162200) is a common inherited tumour predisposition syndrome that affects approximately 1 
in 3,000 individuals worldwide1–3. The history of NF1 research and NF1 diagnostic criteria 
are described in FIG. 1. Some manifestations of NF1 are observed in early childhood, 
whereas others present later in life (FIG. 2).

Almost all patients with NF1 develop cutaneous neurofibromas, which are benign peripheral 
nerve tumours4,5. Some patients also develop benign plexiform neurofibromas, which can 
cause substantial morbidity and can degenerate to form peripheral nerve sarcomas known as 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). These tumours are key contributors 
to reduced life expectancy in NF1 (REF. 6). Another common tumour in patients with NF1

is optic pathway glioma (OPG)7. In 1988, a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
consensus conference defined the currently used NF1 diagnostic criteria8,9. Notably, these 
criteria include neurofibroma and OPG but do not include malignant disease. Rarer tumours 
that develop in patients with NF1 are juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML)10, 
benign or malignant pheochromocytoma11, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)12, 
glomus tumours13, juvenile xanthogranuloma, rhabdomyosarcoma14 and lipoma15. Cloning 
of the NF1 gene (OMIM 613113) led to the identification of biallelic NF1 mutations in 
patient-derived tumours, which in turn immediately led to classification of NF1 as a tumour 
suppressor gene16–18. All NF1-related tumours show biallelic inactivation of the NF1 
gene19,20. Patients with NF1 may also be at an increased risk of developing secondary 
cancers following radiation exposure, and it is important to consider this risk in the 
treatment of this predisposed population21. In addition, patients with NF1 have an increased 
risk of developing several adult cancers22. An analysis of UK death certificates found that 
patients with NF1 may also be at an increased risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, 
liver, lung, bone, thyroid, breast and ovary22. Risk of malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukaemia might also be increased.

Early studies identified the protein encoded by NF1, neurofibromin, as having homology to 
the yeast proteins Ira1 and Ira2, which are inhibitory regulators of the RAS–cyclic AMP 
pathway23–25. In yeast, Ira proteins negatively regulate Ras by converting it from the active 
GTP-bound form to the inactive GDP-bound form. This is required to reduce levels of 
cAMP under nutrient-limiting conditions and to mediate membrane association of adenylyl 
cyclase. Neurofibromin is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that regulates RAS 
(RASGAP). It binds to GTP-bound RAS through its GAP-related domain (GRD) to 
dramatically augment its intrinsic GTPase activity26. Neurofibromin thereby functions as an 
off signal for all of the vertebrate RAS GTPases, including HRAS, NRAS, KRAS, MRAS, 
RRAS and RRAS2 (also known as TC21)27. Therefore, loss of NF1 activates signalling 
through the RAS pathway, which is a key driver of cancer. GTP-bound RAS activates 
multiple effector pathways, including the RAS–MAPK pathway, in which GTP-bound RAS 
activates the RAF–MEK–ERK cascade (reviewed in REF. 28) (FIG. 3).

Mutations in many other genes that encode components of the RAS–MAPK pathway also 
predispose patients to partially overlapping sets of manifestations (known as RASopathies), 
which can include tumours29 (BOX 1). Patients with Noonan syndrome have a 4% risk of 
developing cancer by the age of 20 years, with JMML predominating and 
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and low-grade glioma occurring at lower incidences30. 
Patients with Costello syndrome have a 15% risk of cancer by the age of 20 years, with 
rhabdomyosarcoma developing in 9% of patients, and neuroblastoma and bladder cancer 
developing in 1% of patients30. Patients with Legius syndrome develop lipoma31. The fact 
that all known RASopathy mutations affect the RAS–MAPK signalling pathway supports 
the idea that the MAPK pathway downstream of RAS, and not other pathways downstream 
of RAS, is the crucial driver of tumorigenesis in patients with RASopathies. ‘RASopathy 
clinics’ are beginning to study and compare patients with RASopathies. It is hoped that 
some or all RASopathy manifestations will respond to therapies such as MAPK inhibitors.

Importantly, sequencing of tumour exomes and genomes has revealed that somatic NF1 
mutations are present at incidences from 2.5% to 11.8% in sporadic, predominantly adult, 
tumour types such as lung cancer32, glioblastoma33, ovarian cancer34, breast cancer35 and 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)36; however, they are also present in the paediatric tumour 
rhabdomyosarcoma.

NF1 genetics: mutations and modifiers

Structure of the NF1 gene and mutational analysis

The NF1 gene contains 60 exons and generates multiple alternatively spliced isoforms37. 
More than 1,400 mutations in the NF1 gene have been reported in the Human Gene 
Mutation Database, most of which are clearly loss-of-function alleles. These include splice 
site, nonsense and missense mutations, as well as deletions, insertions, frameshifts and 
translocations38. Notably, several patient missense mutations that affect the neurofibromin 
GRD selectively diminish GAP activity, which supports the notion that the regulation of 
RAS has a crucial role in NF1 disease39. Identification of NF1 mutations in patients remains 
difficult owing to the large gene size and structure, as well as the large range of mutations 
that have been identified40. For many years, 95% of patient mutations were identified using 
a combination of complementary methods, including protein truncation, fluorescence in situ 
hybridization, heteroduplex, Southern blot and cytogenetic analyses38. A preliminary report 
applied next-generation sequencing to samples from patients with NF1 (REF. 41), and DNA-
based sequencing is now being offered as a clinical test for diagnostic purposes (see the 
website of University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Genomics Laboratory). Thus, 
NF1 mutation analysis can assist in diagnosing cases of NF1 in which a clinical diagnosis 
cannot be established with certainty.

The variability in manifestations in patients from a single family with the same NF1 
mutation does not support a major role for genotype–phenotype correlations in NF1 (REF. 
42), although there are several important exceptions. Germline splice site mutations occur in 
30% of patients with NF1, and these patients may have an increased overall tumour risk43. 
Mutations that delete the NF1 gene, and several flanking genes, occur in up to 10% of 
patients with NF1. This class of mutations predisposes affected individuals to an increased 
risk of intellectual disability, to greater numbers of cutaneous neurofibromas and to 
MPNSTs44. Another genotype–phenotype correlation is of a very rare 3-bp deletion in 
patients with NF1 who lack neurofibromas45.

Modifier genes in NF1

Given the paucity of NF1 genotype–phenotype correlations, it was proposed that modifier 
genes underlie the variable penetrance of NF1. Monozygotic twins with NF1 showed a high 
degree of concordance for cutaneous neurofibroma tumour burden and numbers of café-au-
lait macules, supporting the idea that modifier genes contribute to these features46,47. The 
large polygenic deletions (mentioned above) indicate that modifier genes might be linked to 
NF1 (REF. 44). Recently, the gene encoding the chromatin remodelling complex Polycomb 
repressive complex 2 subunit SUZ12, which lies within this region, has been shown to be a 
cooperating tumour suppressor in mouse models and in human tumours48–50. Studies in

mouse models also support roles for modifier genes in NF1. Astrocytoma resistance alleles 
were recently identified as spinal cord resistance to astrocytoma modifier 1 (Scram1) and 
astrocytoma resistance locus in males 1 (Arlm1) loci38,51,52. It is unclear whether disease 
modifier genes in NF1 are also relevant in NF1-mutant sporadic tumours.

In support of a role for modifier genes in NF1 is OPGs; these tumours have a decreased 
prevalence in the African-American population compared with other races53. Sex-linked 
factors may modify prognosis; males are at an increased risk of sporadic high-grade glioma, 
but NF1 females with low-grade OPG have a worse prognosis than males with NF1-related 
OPG54. In addition, male Nf1−/− mouse astrocytes expressing dominant-negative p53 show 
increased tumorigenesis and inactivation of the RB protein compared with cells derived from 
females55. An imprinting control region remotely interacts with an intergenic sequence 
between Nf1 and Wsb1 on chromosome 11 to regulate Nf1 transcription, and mutations in 
this intergenic sequence could also potentially modify NF1 disease56.

NF1 mutations in sporadic cancers

The advancement of whole-genome sequencing has resulted in the identification of NF1 
mutations in various non-NF1-associated sporadic cancers, including glioblastoma33,57, 
neuroblastoma58, AML36, lung cancer32, ovarian cancer34 and breast cancer59. We 
anticipate that the identification of tumours that contain NF1 mutations will continue to 
increase with future sequencing efforts. A comprehensive study that analysed somatic 
mutation patterns in more than 1,500 cancer-related genes in a large panel of lung, breast, 
ovarian, pancreatic and prostate tumours identified NF1 (mutation frequency >5%) as one of 
ten genes that are mutated most often in these types of tumours. In comparison, the point 
mutation frequency was 33% for TP53, 7% for KRAS and 5% for cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)59; however, deletions in CDKN2A are much more common than 
deletions in NF1. It is as yet unknown whether biallelic loss of NF1 is common or whether 
only hemizygous loss of NF1 contributes to tumour progression in sporadic disease. 
Consistent with the latter possibility, mouse cells hemizygous for Nf1 mutations show 
abnormal growth and invasion60–62. Hemizygous NF1-mutant cells might show lower levels 
of GTP-bound RAS than cells with complete inactivation of NF1 and/or develop mutations 
in additional RAS–MAPK pathway genes to affect tumour properties. Although sporadic 
tumours with NF1 mutations are largely exclusive of those tumours that harbour mutations 
in MAPK kinase 1 (MAP2K1) or NRAS, on the basis of our analyses of somatic co-
mutation patterns in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets (cBio Portal for Cancer Genomics), 
11 of 114 melanomas with NF1 mutations also show mutations in BRAF, NRAS or RAF1. 
Thus, there may be subcategories of tumours, and perhaps cells, in which BRAF, NRAS or 
RAF1 are co-mutated with NF1.

In tumours with NF1 mutations, the order of mutations seems to affect tumour grade in 
specific cell types; for example, initial loss of NF1 in nerve glial cells triggers neurofibroma. 
In this case, oncogene-induced senescence occurs, and inactivation of p53 bypasses this 
response for progression to MPNSTs63. Similarly, benign grade 1 astrocytomas develop in 
genetically engineered mice (GEMs) when Nf1 is lost first64. By contrast, aggressive 
gliomas form when Trp53 is co-mutated with Nf1 (REF. 65). Indeed, in human

glioblastomas, half of the tumours with NF1 mutations also harbour TP53 mutations66. 
Mutational order may explain why patients with NF1 are not predisposed to certain sporadic 
tumours, such as lung tumours, whereas >10% of sporadic lung cancers32 have NF1 
mutations, which are probably acquired late in tumorigenesis.

The NF1 protein: neurofibromin

Neurofibromin is a large multi-domain 2,818 amino acid protein67. Exon 23 encodes part of 
the GRD, which is the RAS regulatory domain of neurofibromin. An exon 23 splice variant 
inserts an alternative exon 23a, which decreases neurofibromin RASGAP activity68. In 
addition to this central GRD, neurofibromin contains other functional domains, most of 
which are of uncertain importance in the tumour suppressor function of neurofibromin (FIG. 
4).

Interactions of neurofibromin

In 1991, Bollag and McCormick69 reported that the lipids arachidonate, phosphatidate and 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate inhibit neurofibromin GAP activity, but no definitive 
in vivo role for lipid–neurofibromin interaction through the SEC14 and pleckstrin homology 
(PH) domains has so far been identified. Neurofibromin is also implicated in connecting 
RAS signalling to activation of RHO-family GTPases, which results in modulation of the 
cytoskeleton. Therefore, it is intriguing that the neurofibromin phospholipid-binding SEC14 
and PH domains interact with LIM domain kinase 2 (LIMK2) and thereby inhibit activation 
of LIMK2 by RHO-associated protein kinase, which is known to modulate the actin 
cytoskeleton70. Some neurofibromin domains may function as scaffolds that target 
neurofibromin to specific intracellular locations. Indeed, neurofibromin interacts with 
sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED1). This interaction results in 
localization of neurofibromin to membranes, which enables neurofibromin to down-regulate 
GTP-bound RAS71. Interestingly, SPRED1 is also a RASopathy gene. Unlike mutations in 
NF1, mutations in SPRED1 do not predispose affected individuals to neurofibromas, 
gliomas or MPNSTs but rather to lipomas. Distinct features of each disorder may arise from 
cell type-specific use of components of the MAPK pathway.

Neurofibromin is the main RASGAP in neuronal dendritic spines72, where the molecular 
chaperone valosin-containing protein (VCP) interacts with the leucine-rich repeat domain of 
neurofibromin. In mice, mutations in Vcp, like loss of Nf1, reduce spine density73. 
Importantly, VCP functions downstream of neurofibromin, and expression of VCP rescues 
spine defects in Nf1+/− neurons. VCP is now under investigation as a cancer target. 
Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), which degrades the endogenous 
nitric oxide inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), was identified as another 
neurofibromin interaction partner. Knockdown of Nf1 rescued the decrease in cell 
proliferation caused by knockdown of Ddah1 in mouse endothelial cells74,75, and this is of 
special interest because the modulation of nitric oxide is an attractive therapeutic target.

Neurofibromin regulation and signalling

Neurofibromin protein levels can also be affected by mechanisms beyond NF1 mutation. 
One category of neurofibromin-interacting proteins is ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitylate 
and cause degradation of neurofibromin, thus sustaining RAS signalling. The ubiquitin 
ligase SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene protein; also known as RNF7 and RBX2) was 
reported to interact with neurofibromin and affect vascular development76, whereas the 
ubiquitin ligase cullin 3 degraded neurofibromin in glioblastoma cells in which 
neurofibromin was not mutated76,77. It remains to be determined whether these and/or other 
ubiquitin ligases only degrade neurofibromin in specific settings. Downregulation of 
neurofibromin may also result from the methylation of NF1 in cancer cells78,79. NF1 is also 
a target of micro-RNAs (mi RNAs); expression of miR-128 in neurons and miR-193b in 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells decreased the levels of NF1 mRNA and 
neurofibromin80,81.

Modulation of RAS signalling by neurofibromin

The absence of neurofibromin leads to slowed hydrolysis of GTP-bound RAS, which 
sustains RAS signalling. Nevertheless, upstream receptors are required to activate RAS, and 
several receptors have been implicated upstream of neurofibromin in particular cell types. 
For example, genetic and biochemical evidence support a necessary role of granulocyte–
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and activation of the GM-CSF receptor to 
maintain JMML in Nf1-mutant mice82. This receptor may also have a role in neurofibroma 
formation after nerve injury83. By contrast, activation of the KIT receptor by stem cell factor 
(also known as KIT ligand) has a key role in neurofibroma formation in mice62. In 
Drosophila melanogaster expressing mutant Nf1, the loss of the receptor tyrosine kinase 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) rescues the small size of the flies and ERK activation84. 
Other receptors probably function as upstream regulators of neurofibromin in specific cell 
types.

Neurofibromin and downstream signalling

Of the many putative downstream effectors of RAS signalling — RAL guanine nucleotide 
dissociation stimulator (RALGDS), PI3K, phospholipase Cε, T lymphoma invasion and 
metastasis-inducing protein 1 (TIAM1), RAS association domain family protein (RASSF), 
RAS and RAB interactor 1 (RIN1), RIN2, RIN3, AF6 (also known as afadin and MLLT4), 
impedes mitogenic signal propagation (IMP; also known as BRAP2), RAS-associated and 
PH domains-containing protein 1 (RAPH1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), 
and PDZGEF1 (also known as RAPGEF2) (FIG. 2) — only a few have been studied in the 
context of NF1. The best studied is the neurofibromin–RAS–MAPK pathway. Loss of 
neurofibromin results in the activation of this pathway in multiple types of tumour85,86. Heat 
shock response87 and MAF regulation of mTOR signalling88 also occur downstream of NF1 
loss and subsequent activation of ERK. RAL guanine nucleotide exchange factors have also 
been implicated downstream of RAS in MPNSTs89.

Several studies in mice support important roles for PI3K signalling when loss of Nf1 drives 
tumour formation, and several pathways have been implicated downstream of PI3K. For

example, PI3K–mTOR signalling is enhanced in Nf1-mutant astrocytes and MPNSTs90,91. 
PI3K–AKT signalling downstream of Rras2 has a role in the initiation of neurofibromas92; 
activation of the PI3K pathway through loss of Pten in mice promotes the transformation of 
Nf1-driven neurofibromas to MPNSTs93. Sustained activation of AKT in MPNST cells 
requires calcium and calmodulin94. On the basis of these results, it will be important to 
consider cell type-specific neurofibromin–RAS effector pathways when attempting to 
identify therapeutic targets. In addition, simultaneously targeting multiple RAS effector 
pathways may provide enhanced effects.

NF1 and cAMP

In yeast, the NF1 homologues IRA1 (REF. 95) and IRA2 (REF. 96) regulate both Ras and 
cAMP signalling. Ira1 and Ira2 each simultaneously bind to Ras2 and adenylyl cyclase, thus 
regulating both pathways97. It is accepted that increased levels of cAMP inhibit the 
proliferation of most cell types, and it has been proposed that altered levels of cAMP 
contribute to cancer. Mouse98, D. melanogaster 99 and zebrafish100 cells expressing mutant 
Nf1 all show deregulated cAMP levels. In D. melanogaster lacking Nf1 cAMP levels are 
low, but it remains unclear whether this results from increased Ras activity or whether it 
occurs independently of Ras98,99. By contrast, cAMP levels are increased in mouse Schwann 
cells (peripheral nerve support cells) or human MPNST cells lacking NF1 (REF. 101). Many 
different RAS–cAMP pathway interactions may occur in specific NF1-mutant cell types. In 
mouse neurons, atypical protein kinase C-mediated β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 
(ADRBK1)-driven inactivation of the G protein Gαs modulated RAS activity98,102 . In 
another system, the protein kinase A-activated transcription factor cAMP-responsive 
element-binding protein (CREB) bound to the mir-9 promoter, which repressed expression 
of NF1 and encouraged cell migration103. Interfering with cAMP signalling may present a 
therapeutic opportunity in several manifestations of NF1, as was proposed for NF1-driven 
brain tumours104. Blocking RAS–MAPK signalling and increasing cAMP levels may be 
useful therapeutically; for example, reversing one zebrafish brain defect required blockade 
of MEK, whereas reversing another defect required an increase in cAMP levels100.

NF1 tumorigenesis and tumour cells of origin

Many tumours in patients with germline NF1 mutations are neural crest cell-derived tumours 
(pheochromocytomas, neurofibromas and MPNSTs) or neuroepithelial cell-derived tumours 
(pilocytic astrocytomas). Non-neural-crest-related cells are also predisposed to 
tumorigenesis (JMML and rhabdomyosarcoma). It is not known why specific cell types are 
sensitive to loss of NF1. Affected populations do not express increased levels of 
neurofibromin compared with other cells; it has been speculated that these populations 
critically rely on neurofibromin rather than other GAPs.

Low-grade astrocytoma

At least 15% of patients with NF1 develop OPGs, which are mainly grade I pilocytic 
astrocytomas7. These tumours are defined as benign, generally have a favourable prognosis 
and rarely progress105. In contrast to NF1-related pilocytic astrocytomas, pilocytic 
astrocytomas in patients without NF1 are typically more aggressive, although they have RAS

pathway mutations, including BRAF duplications or activating point mutations in BRAF or 
KRAS106. In GEM models of grade 1 astrocytoma resulting from loss of Nf1, many neurons 
in the brain and most macroglial cells are Nf1−/− owing to use of glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (Gfap)–Cre or brain lipid-binding protein (Blbp; also known as Fabp7)–Cre drivers, 
which excise Nf1 in most brain stem and progenitor cells64,98,107. In this model, other cells 
of the body are Nf1+/− (REF. 64). Evidence indicates that when progenitor cells of the 
developing third ventricle lack Nf1, they develop into aberrant astrocytes, which are 
characteristic of pilocytic astrocytoma108. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of Nf1 in 
other brain cell types (such as oligodendrocytes or NG2 cells) failed to generate 
astrocytomas in zebrafish or mice109,110.

Cutaneous neurofibroma

All neurofibromas contain nerve Schwann cells (with biallelic NF1 mutations111), as well as 
NF1 wild-type or heterozygous fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, perineurial cells and 
endothelial cells. The percentage of each cell type varies from tumour to tumour. 
Neurofibromas in the human dermis or epidermis (known as cutaneous or dermal 
neurofibromas) are benign and do not transform; however, they can cause a substantial 
cosmetic burden in patients. It has been a source of confusion that some plexiform 
neurofibromas, which are more aggressive than cutaneous neurofibromas, also develop in 
the skin and subcutaneous tissue; alternative nomenclature has been discussed but not 
defined by consensus. There are no model organisms at present in which cutaneous 
neurofibromas spontaneously develop. However, after growth in vitro and transplantation 
into Nf1+/− syngeneic hosts, skin hair follicle-derived Nf1−/− precursors (SKPs) formed 
tumours that resembled dermal neurofibromas112. Transplantation of Nf1−/− SKPs into 
pregnant female mice increased growth of neurofibromas in the mouse model112, and 
cutaneous neurofibromas can develop and grow during puberty5 and can increase in size and 
number during pregnancy113. However, it remains unclear whether and which hormones or 
other factors increase the growth of human cutaneous neurofibromas. It is also unclear 
which factors limit the growth of most dermal neurofibromas in humans, and why they are 
resistant to transformation.

Plexiform neurofibroma

Plexiform neurofibromas are complex tumours that can weigh kilograms and can compress 
vital structures. Therefore, they are of considerable interest as targets of therapy. Plexiform 
neurofibromas develop within peripheral nerves and their perineurial sheaths. However, 
plexiform neurofibromas can invade adjacent tissue by disrupting the perineurium, 
remaining non-metastatic and clinically ‘benign’ but accounting for substantial morbidity 
and an increased risk of mortality when symptomatic114.

Extensive modelling of plexiform neurofibromas has been carried out in mice. Plexiform 
neurofibroma models all have biallelic loss of Nf1 in the Schwann cell lineage115–118, which 
is driven by P0 (also known as myelin protein zero (Mpz))–Cre, desert hedgehog (Dhh)–Cre, 
tamoxifen-inducible proteolipid protein (myelin) 1 (Plp1)–Cre, or Krox20 (also known as 
Egr2)–Cre. Each of these drivers knock out expression in Schwann cell progenitors, with 
differences in precise timing, location and the number of cells affected. Some models,

MPNSTs

probably those with fewer cells showing recombination, require additional hemizygous 
inactivation of Nf1 in haematopoietic cells to generate neurofibromas119. In all cases, the 
tumours (grade 1 neurofibromas) in GEM models resemble those of humans. In humans, 
plexiform neurofibromas primarily develop very early in life. Unexpectedly, plexiform 
neurofibromas can be induced even in adult mice, although in one model these are 
rare116,117. Unfortunately, this result does not resolve the uncertainty around the plexiform 
neurofibroma cell of origin, as adult mouse dorsal root ganglia and dorsal roots contain 
stem-like cells, mature Schwann cells and satellite cells, all of which have been proposed as 
possible neurofibroma-initiating cells115–118,120. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-
expressing Schwann cell precursor-like cells are present in mouse and human 
neurofibromas, and form neurofibroma-like lesions under the skin120 or in peripheral 
nerves121 of immunocompromised mice. Extensively passaged Schwann cells from 
neurofibromas can also form neurofibromas in immunocompromised mice122. Thus, de-
differentiated Schwann cells and/or Schwann cell precursors may each be cells of origin for 
neurofibromas.

MPNSTs are nerve-associated sarcomas, most of which arise in pre-existing plexiform 
neurofibromas in patients with NF1 (REF. 123), and are aggressive tumours that typically 
metastasize to the brain, bone and other sites124. Half of all MPNSTs arise sporadically, and 
the other half occur in patients with NF1 (REF. 125). Genetic alterations that affect the RAS 
pathway, including NF1, BRAF, NRAS or KRAS mutations, have been identified in some 
sporadic MPNSTs126,127, and NF1 and sporadic MPNSTs share a gene signature128. 
MPNSTs are also typically hyperdiploid, and their genomes — like genomes in most 
sarcomas — are highly rearranged129. Mutations associated with the transformation from 
benign plexiform neurofibromas to malignant MPNSTs include early mutations in 
CDKN2A129 and later mutations in TP53 (REFS 130–132) and SUZ12 (REF. 133). Loss of 
the tumour suppressor gene RB1 (which encodes RB) is found in 25% of MPNSTs134,135, 
and monosomy for the PTEN locus is observed in 50% of MPNSTs126,134,136,137. Low-level 
amplification of growth factor receptor genes, including EGFR, is also common126.

Human MPNSTs and MPNST cell lines contain CD133+ cells that may be stem-like 
cells138,139. GEM models of MPNSTs include combined loss of Nf1 and Trp53 
(REFS 140,141) or Nf1 and Cdkn2a142,143. MPNSTs from these models and human MPNST 
cell lines contain stem-like cells that propagate disease144. Comparative oncogenomics and 
insertional mutagenesis screens have been used to identify candidate drivers of MPNST 
formation, including MEK, β-catenin and embryonic stem cell-expressed RAS 
(ERAS)86,145,146. In zebrafish, ribosomal gene mutations predispose to the formation of 
MPNSTs, and resulting tumours show loss of p53 translation147.

Other tumours in patients with NF1

Pheochromocytomas11, rhabdomyosarcomas14, glomus tumours20,148 and GISTs12 are 
present at increased incidence in patients with NF1 and show biallelic inactivation of NF1. 
Of these, only pheochromocytoma has been successfully modelled to date. 
Pheochromocytomas form in 15% of Nf1+/− mice149; however, this model has not been used

in preclinical tests, probably owing to low tumour incidence. JMML is a rare paediatric 
manifestation of NF1 (REF. 10) and a RAS-driven haematopoietic stem cell disorder. Thus, 
patients with NF1 and patients with RASopathies who have mutations in NRAS, KRAS, 
CBL, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11; also known as SHP2) or 
son of sevenless homologue 1 (SOS1) are predisposed to this low-grade leukaemia150, 
which is recapitulated in an Mx1–Cre;Nf1fl/fl model151.

Therapeutic implications

Preclinical testing

Importantly, the available mouse models of JMML, OPG, plexiform neurofibroma and 
MPNST are currently used for preclinical testing. Consistent with a major role for RAS–
MAPK signalling in JMML, preclinical testing showed significant response to inhibition of 
MEK151. Disease burden was markedly reduced, although mutant stem cells persisted. The 
finding that the multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib or inhibition of MEK can 
shrink plexiform neurofibromas in mouse models led to clinical trials86,119,151. In the 
imatinib trial, 6 of 36 patients, primarily young children with small plexiform 
neurofibromas, responded to treatment; the target kinase (or kinases) affected in these 
patients is not yet known152. In a Phase I trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (presented 
at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting), 11 of 18 patients with 
plexiform neurofibromas, some up to kilograms in weight, shrank by ≥20% in response to 
therapy, and many showed prolonged response153. These positive results not only support 
continued use of mouse models to guide clinical testing in human neurofibromas but also 
emphasize the finding that these benign tumours can respond to single-agent therapy for up 
to 3 years without showing resistance.

Complete surgical resection is required to cure MPNSTs, and no single-agent or 
combination tested to date has cured MPNSTs in any model system (reviewed in REF. 154). 
Consistent with the idea that combination therapy will be necessary to treat these aggressive 
cancers, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin, together with agents that 
enhance oxidative stress, shrank MPNSTs133. In MPNST xenografts, prolonged responses 
have been observed with Aurora kinase inhibition and bromodomain inhibitors, but these 
have not yet been tested in mouse models of MPNSTs or in patients with NF1 
(REFS 155,156). In some MPNSTs, autocrine chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 
(CXCL12)–CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) signalling activates β-catenin through the AKT–
glycogen synthase kinase 3β–β-catenin stabilization pathway157. Transposon mutagenesis 
confirmed WNT pathway signalling as a driver of the transformation to MPNSTs, and many 
β-catenin pathway genes are deregulated in neurofibroma and MPNSTs158. Although other 
links between NF1 signalling and β-catenin pathway activation remain to be identified, these 
data and analysis of human NF1 Schwann cells support inhibition of the β-catenin pathway 
as a possible therapeutic target in NF1-driven tumours159.

NF1 loss as a drug resistance marker

MPNSTs in patients with NF1 are notoriously resistant to chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy. Recently, a large-scale study showed almost no benefit of chemotherapy or

radiotherapy for NF1 MPNSTs, and a worse outcome has been reported for NF1 than for 
sporadic MPNSTs124. These data must be interpreted with caution, as late diagnosis of 
MPNSTs arising in plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1 may account for 
differences between the groups in treatment outcome160. However, although reasons might 
differ as to what causes resistance in sporadic tumours, NF1 has been identified as a gene 
that confers resistance to targeted therapy, including inhibition of kinases and the RAS 
pathway, in sporadic neuroblastoma58, lung carcinoma161 and melanoma162. In lung cancer 
models, resistance to EGFR therapy was mediated by NF1, and blocking MEK restored the 
response161. Melanoma develops in mice with mutant Braf, and loss of Nf1 blocked Braf-
driven oncogene-induced senescence. Nf1-mutant and Braf-mutant tumours are resistant to 
BRAF inhibitors; however, they are sensitive to combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR162. 
Loss of NF1 was also identified as a crucial mediator of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in 
melanoma cells163,164. These studies indicate that blocking NF1 pathways — for example, 
by targeting MEK — might enhance the therapeutic response in those tumours with NF1 
mutations. There are probably also other resistance pathways downstream of NF1. In a 
neuroblastoma model, resistance was mediated by NF1 through ZNF423, which encodes a 
zinc-finger transcription factor58.

It is increasingly clear that the recruitment of mast cells, macrophages and other stromal 
cells in the tumour microenvironment can elicit tumour cell resistance to therapy165. NF1−/− 
Schwann cells upregulate major histocompatibility complex class II mRNA and protein 
levels, which may influence tumour–immune cell interactions166. Neurofibromas and 
MPNSTs contain blood-derived mast cells167 and macrophages168. The stroma in NF1 
neurofibromas has been recently reviewed169. These haematopoietic cells have a crucial role 
in the formation and growth of neurofibromas. In some GEM models, the haematopoietic 
cells must express mutant Nf1 for neurofibromas to form119. Treatment with PLX3397 — 
which targets both KIT signalling to prevent mast cell recruitment to tumours, and CSF1 
receptor signalling to prevent macrophage recruitment to tumours — had two effects on 
neurofibromas. It increased their size when given during tumour initiation and enabled 
tumour regression in some mice when given after tumour establishment. Therefore, 
macrophages may protect against developing tumours and later become permissive to 
tumour formation168. However, wounding peripheral nerves in Nf1-mutant mice, which 
recruits macrophages, facilitates neurofibroma formation, implying that macrophages may 
promote tumour formation in this context83,170. OPGs that arise in Nf1-mutant mice also 
contain CX3CR1-expressing microglial cells (brain-resident macrophages). Cx3cr1−/− mice 
show delayed optic glioma formation, which supports interference with the micro-
environment as a possible therapy in patients with NF1 (REF. 171). In an MPNST xenograft, 
PLX3397 treatment resulted in macrophage depletion and substantially delayed MPNST 
growth. The effect was enhanced by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and correlated with 
enhanced depletion of macrophages172.

Discovering new drug targets for NF1-mutant cells

Screening a library of 200,000 small molecules on mouse Nf1-mutant MPNST cells 
identified compound 21, with selectivity towards NF1-mutant cells and efficacy in 
xenografts173. Another library-screening study identified UC1 as a small molecule that

targets NF1−/− versus sporadic MPNST cell lines. Budding yeast in which IRA2 was deleted 
validated selectivity of UC1 for NF1-mutant cells174. Direct targets of these compounds are 
not known. Gene expression, methylome and copy number changes on several sample sets 
are publically available for neurofibromas and MPNSTs, and are being used to identify 
pathways and targets for drug discovery175. Preliminary assessments of miRNAs and serum 
biomarkers have also become available. Several proteins were identified either at increased 
levels in patients with NF1 but without neurofibromas (interferon-γ, interleukin-6 and 
tumour necrosis factor) or at increased levels in patients with NF1 and MPNST (insulin-like 
growth factor-binding protein 1, C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5) and 
adrenomedullin)176,177. Expression of miR-801, miR-214 and miR-24 can distinguish 
patients with both NF1 and MPNST from patients with NF1 but without MPNST178. 
However, no NF1 biomarker has yet been tested clinically.

Successes and future challenges

The NF1 community has been very successful in identifying the NF1 gene and developing 
animal models for plexiform neurofibroma, MPNST and JMML. The community has also 
succeeded in identifying plausible therapeutic strategies and advancing them from 
preclinical testing to clinical trials, through preclinical and clinical testing consortia and a 
group developing end points for clinical trials179. However, some NF1-driven cancers still 
lack model systems or have models that are difficult to use for preclinical testing. Although 
the neurofibromin protein has been studied, many questions remain concerning the relevance 
of possible interaction partners and functions of neurofibromin protein domains. Although it 
is now clear that the RAS–MAPK pathway is crucial for mediating NF1-mutant tumour 
growth, other pathways downstream of RAS signalling are likely to be relevant and may be 
cell type dependent. In particular, an important goal of the next few years will be to better 
understand altered non-RAS–cAMP signalling downstream of NF1 loss. Identification of 
inhibitors of cell type-specific pathways that synergize with blockade of MEK, including 
inhibitors that target other RAS effector pathways, could be attempted. We anticipate that 
therapies successful in treating NF1 disease manifestations will also be successful in the 
treatment of other RASopathies and hope that these therapies, in combination with other 
drugs, will also be useful in treating sporadic NF1-mutant cancer.

RASopathy genes and syndromes

RASopathies commonly predispose patients to short stature, developmental delay and 
cardiac abnormalities29. The syndrome (or syndromes) associated with each gene (or 
genes) is indicated by light grey arrows in the figure. RASopathies include the common 
disorders neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; which affects 1 in 3,000 individuals) and 
Noonan syndrome (which affects 1 in 2,000 individuals) and rare conditions, such as 
Costello syndrome. Mutations in several RAS–MAPK genes can cause Noonan 
syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; previously known as 
LEOPARD syndrome) and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Other RASopathies, 
including NF1, are associated with a single gene mutation. Legius syndrome is associated 
with mutations in sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing 1 (SPRED1), and capillary 
malformation–arteriovenous malformation (CM–AVM) is associated with mutations in 
RASA1 (which encodes p120GAP). RASopathy genes include protein tyrosine 
phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), CBL, son of sevenless homologue 1 
(SOS1), RAF1, HRAS, NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, MAPK kinase 2 (MAP2K2) and SHOC2. 
New RASopathy genes continue to be identified; newly identified genes include 
RRAS180, RAS-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1)181, MAP2K1 and RASA2 (REF. 182). 
Many RASopathies predispose to tumours, including juvenile myelomonocytic 
leukaemia, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma29. GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound 
protein 2; SHC, SRC homology 2 domain-containing.

Figure 1. Neurofibromatosis type 1 historical developments
From the development of diagnostic criteria to the development of ongoing clinical trials, the 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) field has been aided by close clinician–scientist interactions, 
which have been facilitated by the Children’s Tumor Foundation. Currently accepted 
diagnostic criteria include six or more café-au-lait macules with a minimum diameter of >5 
mm in pre-pubertal subjects; two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform 
neurofibroma; freckling in the axillary or inguinal region; optic pathway glioma; two or 
more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas); a distinctive osseous lesion, such as sphenoid 
dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudarthrosis; and a first-degree 
relative with NF1 according to these criteria. GEM, genetically engineered mouse; JMML, 
juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia; MPNSTs, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours; 
NIH, National Institutes of Health.

Figure 2. Disease manifestations in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: epochs in which they 
develop
Most plexiform neurofibromas are present at a very young age but, depending on the tumour 
location, may not be diagnosed until later in life if whole-body magnetic resonance imaging 
is not performed192. Multiple hyperpigmented skin lesions (café-au-lait macules) are an 
early sign of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are observable in children under 3 years of 
age193. Young children may also present with bone dysplasia194, delayed speech195 and 
delayed acquisition of motor skills196. Young children with NF1 are at an increased risk of 
developing juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML)10 and optic pathway glioma (mean 
age of 5 years197). Later in childhood, cognitive issues surface198. If the features labelled in 
burgundy do not occur early, they will not develop later in life. The dark blue line shows that 
speech, language, motor and cognitive changes are detected, as children would normally 
develop specific skills. Cutaneous neurofibromas typically begin to grow during puberty5. 
Although malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) may occur in childhood, 
they are most common in adult patients with NF1 over 30 years of age124. Beyond cancer, it 
is now appreciated that generalized or specific cognitive impairment is observed in >50% of 
patients with NF1 (REF. 198), and many have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Features of autism spectrum disorder may occur199, and vascular defects are common200. On 
the basis of cloning of the NF1 gene, understanding of the related disorders and clarification 
of age-of-onset of individual disease manifestations, it has been suggested (since 2007) that 
the diagnostic criteria may need revision201.

Figure 3. Neurofibromatosis type 1 signalling pathways
In the absence of negative regulation of RAS proteins, resulting from loss of 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, which encodes neurofibromin), GTP-bound RAS levels are 
increased. Therefore, signalling pathways downstream of RAS that are normally activated 
by receptors — including receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins and ion channels — show 
enhanced activation. RAS signalling pathways include the MEK–ERK signalling cascade 
downstream of RAF and also many other potential RAS effectors, including AF6, an F-actin 
and RAP1-binding protein; RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RALGDS), a 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RALA and RALB GTPases; T lymphoma 
invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1 (TIAM1), an exchange factor for the GTPase 
RAC1; phospholipase Cε (PLCε), an isoform of the phospholipase C family; and RAS and 
RAB interactor 1 (RIN1), which is a RAS effector and RAB5 GEF. In addition, loss of NF1 
results in deregulation of cyclic AMP levels in affected cells through poorly characterized 
mechanisms that may be independent of RAS and/or result from crosstalk between RAS and 
heterotrimeric G protein signalling. RAF and cAMP are the only effector pathways currently 
shown to have therapeutic potential in NF1 disease. GAP, GTPase-activating protein.

Figure 4. Neurofibromin protein structure and interacting proteins
Neurofibromin contains multiple domains (light blue). These include a cysteine–serine-rich 
domain (CSRD), a tubulin-binding domain (TBD), a central GTPase-activating protein-
related domain (GRD), a SEC14 domain202,203, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a 
carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and a syndecan-binding domain (SBD). The SEC14 and 
PH domains bind to phospholipids, and have been studied structurally204. Proteins identified 
as neurofibromin-interacting proteins and phospholipids (ovals) are shown associated with 
functions ascribed to them, including intracellular trafficking (light yellow); neuronal 
differentiation (dark yellow); membrane localization (dark blue); actin cytoskeleton 
remodelling (light pink); ubiquitylation (dark pink); cell adhesion (purple) and cell 
signalling through nitric oxide via dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) 
and RAS (turquoise). Each interacting protein is shown bound to the domain of 
neurofibromin with which it is believed to interact. Some proteins are known to interact with 
neurofibromin, but the binding site is unknown. Phosphorylation (P) sites implicated as 
protein kinase A substrates are shown. Descriptions of each interacting protein, binding 
domains and literature references are shown in Supplementary information S1 (table). APP, 
amyloid-β (A4) precursor protein; DPYSL2, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2; FAF2, 
FAS-associated factor 2; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; LIMK2, LIM domain kinase 2; 
LRPPRC, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide motif-containing protein; SCF, Skp, Cullin, F-box-
containing complex; SPRED1, sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1; VCP, 
valosin-containing protein.
