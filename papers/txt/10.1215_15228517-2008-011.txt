People with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have multiple 
benign neurofibromas and a 10% lifetime risk of develop-
ing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). 
Most MPNSTs develop from benign plexiform neu-
rofibromas, so the burden of benign tumors may be a 
risk factor for developing MPNST. We studied 13 NF1 
patients with MPNSTs and 26 age- and sex-matched 
controls (NF1 patients who did not have MPNSTs) with 
detailed clinical examinations and whole-body MRI to 
characterize their body burden of internal benign neuro-
fibromas. Internal plexiform neurofibromas were iden-
tified in 22 (56%) of the 39 NF1 patients studied. All 
six of the NF1 patients with MPNSTs under 30 years of 
age had neurofibromas visualized on whole-body MRI, 
compared to only 3 of 11 matched NF1 controls under 
age 30 (p , 0.05). Both the median number of plexi-
form neurofibromas (p , 0.05) and the median neuro-
fibroma volume (p , 0.01) on whole-body MRI were 
significantly greater among MPNST patients younger 
than 30 years of age than among controls. No significant 
differences in whole-body MRI findings were observed 
between NF1 patients with MPNSTs and controls who 
were 30 years of age or older. Whole-body MRI of NF1

patients allows assessment of the burden of internal neu-
rofibromas, most of which are not apparent on physi-
cal examination. Whole-body imaging of young NF1 
patients may allow those at highest risk for developing 
MPNST to be identified early in life. Close surveillance 
of these high-risk patients may permit earlier diagnosis 
and more effective treatment of MPNSTs that develop.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dom-

inant disease caused by mutations of the NF1 
tumor-suppressor gene.1–3 The cardinal feature 
of NF1, and the one that gives the disease its name, is 
multiple cutaneous neurofibromas. NF1 patients may 
also develop subcutaneous neurofibromas, nodular 
plexiform neurofibromas, and diffuse plexiform neu-
rofibromas.4,5 Nodular and diffuse plexiform neurofi-
bromas may occur anywhere in the body, but many are 
internal and therefore not apparent on physical exami-
nation. At least 40% of adults with NF1 have internal 
plexiform neurofibromas that can be seen on CT or 
MRI examination, although most of these tumors are  
asymptomatic.6,7

Mautner et al.: Whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatosis 1

People with NF1 also have a risk of developing con-
nective tissue malignancy that is more than 100 times 
greater than expected8; most of these soft tissue sar-
comas are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
(MPNSTs). The lifetime risk of MPNST among NF1 
patients has been estimated to be about 10%.9 Most 
MPNSTs in people with NF1 are diagnosed in adoles-
cence or early adulthood rather than in late adulthood,9 
as occurs in the general population.10

The risk of developing MPNST appears to be higher 
in some NF1 patients than in others. People with NF1 
whose pathogenic mutation is a deletion of the whole 
NF1 gene are thought to have a 16%–25% chance of 
developing MPNSTs.11 Other factors that may be associ-
ated with a higher risk of developing MPNST in people 
with NF1 are the occurrence of neurofibromatous neu-
ropathy,12,13 exposure to therapeutic radiation,9 previous 
occurrence of MPNST,13,14 or the occurrence of MPNST 
in a relative with NF1.15–17

Tucker et al.18 found an association of MPNSTs with 
the presence of subcutaneous neurofibromas in a clini-
cal study of 464 probands with NF1 (odds ratio 5 2.8, 
95% confidence interval 1.1–6.9). One hundred forty-
one individuals included in the Tucker et al. study had 
routine chest radiographs or abdominal ultrasound 
examinations to screen for internal tumors. A very 
strong association was observed between the presence 
of internal neurofibromas and MPNSTs in these patients 
(odds ratio 5 18.1, 95% confidence interval 4.6–73.4, 
after adjustment for age and subcutaneous neurofibro-
mas). The imaging methods used in the Tucker et al. 
study provided information about only part of the total 
body burden of benign tumors in patients who devel-
oped MPNSTs, and in many of these cases the malig-
nancy developed in an area other than the one that had 
been imaged.18

To evaluate the relationship of the total body bur-
den of internal neurofibromas to MPNSTs more fully, 
we performed whole-body MRI on 13 NF1 patients 
with MPNSTs and 26 controls matched for age and sex 
who had NF1 but did not have MPNSTs. We found an 
association between the presence of MPNSTs and higher 
body burdens of benign internal neurofibromas on MRI 
among young NF1 patients.

Materials and Methods

Patients

Patients with NF1 diagnosed by the NIH Diagnostic Cri-
teria19,20 and followed in the University Hospital Eppen-
dorf Neurofibromatosis Clinic during 2004 and 2005 
were invited to participate in an imaging study to define 
their body burden of benign neurofibromas. Fourteen of 
the NF1 patients seen during this time had histologically 
confirmed MPNSTs, and all 14 agreed to participate. 
During the same period, 77 NF1 patients older than 2 
years of age who were not known or suspected to have 
MPNSTs were invited to take part in the study, and 66 
agreed to do so.

All patients were screened for large deletions of the 
NF1 locus by testing for heterozygosity of six intragenic 
microsatellite markers and one 3' flanking microsatellite 
marker as previously described.21 Deletions identified by 
marker screening were confirmed by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization.22 Ten of the 91 patients who volunteered 
for our study had NF1 whole-gene deletions as their 
constitutional mutations. These 10 subjects (1 with a 
MPNST and 9 without MPNSTs) were eliminated from 
our study because constitutional whole-gene deletions of 
NF1 are associated with unusually large benign tumor 
burdens and an increased risk of MPNST.11,23,24

We matched two NF1 patients without MPNSTs 
as controls to each of the 13 remaining NF1 patients 
with MPNSTs by sex and age 63 years. If more than 
two matching controls were available for a particular 
MPNST patient, random numbers were electronically 
assigned to each subject, and the two matching con-
trols whose random numbers were closest to that of the 
MPNST patient were selected. All participants provided 
informed consent to take part in the study, which was 
approved by the institutional human experimentation 
committee.

Each patient was evaluated clinically by one of the 
authors (V-F.M), who has extensive experience in caring 
for patients with NF1. Complete medical history and 
physical examination were performed with particular 
attention to features of NF1, and the numbers of cuta-
neous, subcutaneous, and externally visible plexiform 
neurofibromas in each patient were counted (if ,1000) 
or estimated (if >1000). Cutaneous and subcutaneous 
neurofibromas were differentiated by the fact that cuta-
neous tumors move with the skin, whereas the skin can 
be moved over the top of subcutaneous tumors.

MRI and Estimation of Whole-Body Tumor Volume

The whole-body MRI protocol utilized a 1.5 tesla mag-
net, integrated body coil, and sequences with and with-
out intravenous contrast. The subject was imaged in 
supine position from head to knee in four steps (head, 
thorax, abdomen, and legs) in accordance with the 
maximum range of table movement (Fig. 1). The head 
was imaged with contrast using T1 and T2 spin echo 
sequences and T1 sequences with and without spectral 
fat saturation. The body was imaged without contrast 
using T1 gradient echo sequences and T2 STIR (short 
T1 inversion recovery) technique in the axial and cor-
onal plane and with contrast using T1 gradient echo 
sequences with spectral fat saturation in the axial plane. 
Slice thickness was 5–10 mm with no skips between  
slices.

MRI analysis was performed by a physician trained 
in image analysis of NF1-associated tumors. The analy-
sis was done without any other information regarding 
the patients, all of whom were unknown to the reader. 
Plexiform neurofibroma volume was determined using 
a previously described method on the MEDx software 
platform.25 The method is based on:

1. Contrast, defined by intensity in the tumor (high 
signal intensity) compared with the surrounding tis-
sue (low signal intensity),
2. Intensity gradient, defining the outside border 
(margin) of the lesion, and
3. Size of the lesion: plexiform neurofibromas are 
usually substantial in size, and small, isolated areas 
of high signal intensity can be ignored because their 
contribution to the total plexiform neurofibroma vol-
ume is insignificant.
The method used for this automated volumetric anal-
ysis is sensitive (it detects volume changes as small as 
10%), reproducible (coefficient of variation 0.6%–5.6%), 
and it produces results similar to manual tumor trac-
ings (R 5 0.999). When automated tumor volume mea-
surement was not feasible, the reason was recorded and 
manual tumor tracings with the MEDx software draw-
ing tool were used to define tumor volume as previously 
described.25 Using this method, we could reliably mea-
sure plexiform neurofibromas that were >3 cm in great-
est diameter. The volumes of all plexiform neurofibro-
mas that were >3 cm in greatest diameter were summed 
to get the total body plexiform neurofibroma volume. 
Volumetric analysis was not done on lesions that were 
,3 cm in greatest diameter.

The resolution of the whole-body scan allowed for 
only limited evaluation of spinal neurofibromas. When 
visible, spinal neurofibromas were classified by location 
(cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine) and size. The vol-
ume of spinal neurofibromas .3 cm in greatest diameter 
was calculated and included in the total plexiform neu-
rofibroma volume.

Statistical Analyses

The distributions of age, tumor numbers, and tumor size 
were highly skewed, so comparisons of these variables 
between the NF1 patients with MPNSTs and matched 
control subjects were made using the nonparametric 
Mann-Whitney U test. Frequencies of occurrence of 
tumors of various kinds identified on MRI were com-
pared between groups of NF1 patients using Fisher’s 
exact test for 2 3 2 comparisons and Pearson’s 2 test 
when there were multiple categories. 

Results

We studied 13 patients with NF1 and MPNSTs and 26 
age- and sex-matched controls (NF1 patients who were 
not known to have or suspected of having MPNSTs). 
Detailed clinical examination and whole-body MRI 
were performed on each subject. Clinical features of the 
patients with MPNSTs are summarized in the Supple-
mentary Table. The numbers of cutaneous neurofibro-
mas and external plexiform neurofibromas among the 
NF1 patients with MPNSTs and controls were similar, 
but the median number of subcutaneous neurofibro-
mas was significantly greater among NF1 patients with 
MPNSTs than among controls (Table 1). The presence 
of internal neurofibromas, median number of measur-

able internal neurofibromas, and total volume of inter-
nal neurofibromas on whole-body MRI did not differ 
significantly between NF1 patients with MPNSTs and 
controls without MPNSTs overall (Table 2).

Many NF1 patients who develop MPNSTs do so at 
an extraordinarily young age26,27: the median age of NF1 
patients with MPNSTs in this study was only 30 years. 
In comparison, the median age of diagnosis of MPNST 
in people who do not have NF1 is 62 years.9 Rapid 
growth of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 patients may 
occur in children but is unusual in adults,4,5 so we won-
dered whether the burden of plexiform neurofibromas 
seen on whole-body MRI might be associated with the 
development of MPNSTs in younger NF1 patients. We 
therefore compared NF1 patients with MPNSTs whose 

596

age was less than the median in this study (30 years) to 
NF1 controls without MPNSTs who were younger than 
30 years old.

All 6 of the NF1 patients with MPNSTs younger than 
30 years of age had neurofibromas visualized on whole-
body MRI, and both the median number of internal 
neurofibromas and the median internal neurofibroma 
volume were significantly greater among these patients 
than among NF1 controls younger than 30 years of 
age (Table 3). No significant differences in whole-body 
MRI findings were observed between NF1 patients with 
MPNSTs and controls without MPNSTs who were older 
than 30 (Table 3).

Discussion

Neurofibromas can occur anywhere in the body in 
people with NF1, and at least 40% of affected adults 
have neurofibromas internally, although most are not 
apparent on physical examination.6,7 Using whole-body 
MRI, we found internal plexiform neurofibromas in 13 
(50%) of 26 NF1 patients without MPNSTs. This figure 
underestimates the proportion of NF1 patients who have 
internal plexiform neurofibromas because lesions ,3 cm 
in greatest diameter, which include many spinal tumors, 
were excluded.

We found an association between the median number 
of subcutaneous neurofibromas in NF1 patients and the 
occurrence of MPNSTs overall (Table 1). In contrast, we 
found no difference in the median number of cutaneous 
neurofibromas or of external visible plexiform neuro-
fibromas between the NF1 patients with MPNSTs and 
their matched controls without MPNSTs (Table 1). Our 
findings are similar to those of Tucker et al.,18 who stud-
ied 476 French NF1 patients, 25 of whom had MPNSTs. 
Tucker et al. found that the presence of subcutaneous 
neurofibromas, but not the presence of superficial plexi-
form neurofibromas or the number of cutaneous neurofi-
bromas, was associated with the occurrence of MPNSTs. 
Our findings are also consistent with a cohort study per-
formed by the same investigators in which subcutane-
ous, but not cutaneous, neurofibromas were associated 
with a higher risk of death among adults with NF1.28

The association of MPNSTs with subcutaneous, but 
not cutaneous, neurofibromas may reflect differences 
in pathogenesis of these two types of benign peripheral 
nerve sheath tumors. Cutaneous neurofibromas develop 
from the terminal branches of peripheral nerves distal 
to the perineurial sheath.5 Subcutanteous neurofibro-
mas, in contrast, develop within a peripheral nerve and 
are circumscribed by the perineurium.5 Older adults 
with NF1 may have thousands of cutaneous neurofi-
bromas, but malignant degeneration of these tumors is 
exceedingly rare, if it occurs at all. Discrete subcutane-
ous neurofibromas do not often become malignant, but 
they may, and subcutaneous plexiform neurofibromas 
carry a relatively high risk of malignant transformation. 
Some internal plexiform neurofibromas, such as those 
of major spinal nerves or nerve roots, also develop intra-
neurally and carry a relatively high risk of malignant 
transformation.5 The similarities in pathogenesis and 
natural history of these internal and subcutaneous neu-
rofibromas and the differences in comparison to cuta-
neous tumors may explain the association we observed 
between MPNSTs and the occurrence of subcutaneous 
but not cutaneous neurofibromas.18

Tucker et al.18 found a strong association between the 
occurrence of MPNSTs and the presence of internal neu-
rofibromas. We did not find such an association overall, 
but this may reflect the smaller number of subjects in 
our study. The most striking associations we observed 

Mautner et al.: Whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatosis 1

are between MPNSTs in NF1 patients younger than 30 
years of age and the presence of internal neurofibromas, 
median number of internal neurofibromas, and median 
total volume of neurofibromas on MRI in comparison to 
NF1 controls (Table 3). The occurrence of these statisti-
cally significant associations despite the small number of 
MPNST patients in this younger subset is remarkable. 
Independent confirmation of our findings is necessary.

Good medical care for all NF1 patients requires 
long-term clinical follow-up,20,29–31 but we do not know 
the natural history of internal neurofibromas in NF1 
patients of various ages. The only reported series of 
serial MRI examinations in NF1 patients with plexi-
form neurofibromas included only young patients, most 
of whom had been selected for therapeutic trials because 
of inoperable or progressive tumors.25 These data do 
not provide an appropriate basis for recommendations 
regarding the use of longitudinal MRI for follow-up of 
NF1 patients found to have internal tumors on whole-
body MRI. Therefore, we cannot make evidence-based 
recommendations regarding the use of MRI in the rou-
tine follow-up of NF1 patients with internal plexiform 
neurofibromas at the present time.

Inhomogeneous appearance and patchy contrast 
enhancement of an NF1-associated tumor on MRI32,33 
can help distinguish benign and malignant peripheral 
nerve sheath tumors in people with NF1, but histopatho-
logical examination is necessary for definitive diagno-
sis of MPNSTs. We cannot be certain that some of the 
internal tumors that we considered to be neurofibromas 
are not early malignancies except by long-term clinical 
follow-up, which is ongoing for all of our patients.

Growth of neurofibromas can vary over time, and a 
recent longitudinal volumetric MRI study of plexiform 
neurofibromas in 49 NF1 patients younger than 26 years 
of age found that growth was fastest in the youngest 
patients.25 This period of rapid growth early in life may 
also be a time during which malignant transformation 
of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurs in NF1 
patients. MPNSTs generally have a poor prognosis, but 
the prognosis is even worse in people with NF1.9,39 Our 
findings raise the possibility that routine whole-body 
imaging of young NF1 patients may permit identification 
of those at highest risk for developing MPNSTs early in 
life. Closer clinical monitoring and serial MRI examina-
tions for changes in the appearance or growth of internal 
tumors may allow earlier diagnosis and more effective 
treatment of MPNSTs in these high-risk patients. Posi-
tron emission tomography may also help differentiate 
benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
in NF1 patients.34–38 Longitudinal studies are needed to 
assess the value of MRI for early detection and serial 
monitoring of internal plexiform neurofibromas on the 
outcome of MPNSTs that develop in people with NF1. 
Instituting such a policy would require a major change 
from current standards of clinical care.20,29–31
