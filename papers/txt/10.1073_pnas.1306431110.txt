Here we have sought to characterize the mechanism whereby
phosphorylation of K-Ras4B on serine 181 impairs cell survival.
We found that the organelle upon which K-Ras4B acts to limit
survival is the ER where phospho–K-Ras4B interacts with inositol
trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors (IP3Rs). This interaction inter-
feres with the ability of Bcl-xL to promote the IP3R-mediated
transfer of calcium from the ER to mitochondria where this di-
valent cation is required for efﬁcient respiration. We also found
that phospho–K-Ras4B expression did not activate the intrinsic
pathway of apoptosis but was associated with the induction of
autophagy. Our data indicate that IP3R is a previously un-
appreciated effector of K-Ras4B that mediates the toxicity ob-
served upon phospho–K-Ras expression.

K-Ras4B is targeted to the plasma membrane by a farnesyl modi-
ﬁcation that operates in conjunction with a polybasic domain. We
characterized a farnesyl-electrostatic switch whereby protein ki-
nase C phosphorylates K-Ras4B on serine 181 in the polybasic re-
gion and thereby induces translocation from the plasma membrane
to internal membranes that include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and outer mitochondrial membrane. This translocation is associated
with cell death. Here we have explored the mechanism of phos-
pho–K-Ras4B toxicity and found that GTP-bound, phosphorylated
K-Ras4B associates with inositol trisphosphate receptors on the ER
in a Bcl-xL–dependent fashion and, in so doing, blocks the ability of
Bcl-xL to potentiate the InsP3 regulated ﬂux of calcium from ER to
mitochondria that is required for efﬁcient respiration, inhibition of
autophagy, and cell survival. Thus, we have identiﬁed inositol tri-
sphosphate receptors as unique effectors of K-Ras4B that antago-
nize the prosurvival signals of other K-Ras effectors.

Results
Phospho-K-Ras Limits Cell Survival from the ER. Whereas phos-
phorylation of K-Ras4B on serine 181 was associated with trans-
location to the OMM and diminished cell survival suggesting
apoptosis (6), subsequent analysis failed to produce evidence of
programmed cell death (Fig. S1). Most compelling of these
results was the ability of K-Ras12V181E to limit cell survival in
murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) deﬁcient in both Bax and
Bak, which are deﬁcient in apoptosis driven by mitochondrial
dysfunction (8). We therefore sought a qualitative, apoptosis-
independent assay for phospho–K-Ras–induced toxicity and de-
veloped a clonogenic assay that assesses the ability of cells stably
expressing K-Ras or mutations thereof to survive in culture and
grow to conﬂuence (Materials and Methods). Using this assay, we
found that, whereas wild-type (WT) MEFs are sensitive to phos-
phomimetic K-Ras12V181E, Bcl-xL-deﬁcient MEFs (Bcl-xL−/−)
were protected. Importantly, toxicity could be restored by expression

Signiﬁcance

K-Ras is mutated more often than any other oncogene, making
the protein and the pathways it regulates attractive targets for
anticancer drug discovery. We have shown that phosphorylation
of serine 181 in the membrane-targeting region of K-Ras causes
the protein to translocate from plasma membrane to intra-
cellular membranes. Translocation is associated with toxicity but
the mechanism has remained undeﬁned. Here we show that
phospho–K-Ras associates with inositol trisphosphate receptors
(IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thereby blocks
one of the prosurvival activities of Bcl-xL, which is to sensitize
IP3Rs and thereby allow constitutive transfer of calcium from
ER to mitochondria where it is required for efﬁcient respiration.
This pathway could be exploited to limit the oncogenic activity
of mutant K-Ras.

than any other oncogene (1). Four Ras proteins are generated
from three Ras genes because the transcript of the kras locus is
alternatively spliced. Because Ras-dependent cancers most often
harbor a mutation in kras (2), unique properties of the K-Ras
proteins may prove useful in developing anti-Ras therapeutics.

Ras proteins differ substantially only in their C-terminal 23–24
amino acids, which constitute the hypervariable regions (HVRs)
that target Ras proteins to membranes (3). The HVR includes
the C-terminal CAAX motif, which is modiﬁed by farnesylation,
proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation (3). However, these mod-
iﬁcations are insufﬁcient to stably target Ras proteins to membranes
(4). Three of the four Ras isoforms also require palmitoylation at
cysteines in the HVR. K-Ras4B is unique among Ras proteins in
that it lacks modiﬁcation with palmitate. Instead, this isoform
augments the membrane afﬁnity afforded by the farnesyl modiﬁ-
cation with a nearby polylysine motif that forms an electrostatic
interaction with the negatively charged headgroups of the phos-
pholipids of the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (5).

We recently found that phosphorylation by protein kinase
C (PKC) of serine 181 (S181) within the polybasic region of
K-Ras4B neutralized the positive charge to a sufﬁcient degree
to promote release from the plasma membrane and cause accu-
mulation of the GTPase on internal membranes (6). We coined
the term “farnesyl-electrostatic switch” for this membrane release
mechanism (7). When the farnesyl-electrostatic switch is engaged
by stimulating PKC or substituting a phosphomimetic residue
for serine 181, phospho–K-Ras4B translocates from the plasma
membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus,
and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (6). Unexpectedly,
this translocation is associated with markedly diminished survival
of cells, suggesting a unique strategy for anti-Ras therapeutics.
Preliminary studies implicated apoptosis in phospho–K-Ras4B–
mediated toxicity because a ﬂuorescent biosensor for caspase-3
activation reported activity in cells expressing phospho–K-Ras
(6). Paradoxically, Bcl-xL was required for phospho–K-Ras4B–
stimulated cell death, suggesting a functional interaction between
K-Ras4B and Bcl-xL that interferes with a survival pathway (6).

of exogenous Bcl-xL (Fig. S2A). To conﬁrm that PKC-mediated
phosphorylation of endogenous K-Ras has similar effects as
ectopic expression of the phosphomimetic form, we used a pair
of cell lines derived from HCT116 human colon cancer cells that
are hemizygous for either WT K-Ras or oncogenic K-Ras13D,
but isogenic at all other loci (9). Whereas HCT116 K-Ras WT
cells were insensitive to PKC agonists, these agents inhibited the
growth of HCT116 K-Ras13D cells (Fig. S2B), suggesting that
phosphorylation of activated K-Ras limits growth.

Because phospho–K-Ras translocates to multiple internal
membranes, including the Golgi apparatus, ER, and OMM (6),
we sought to determine which, if any, of these subcellular loca-
tions are associated with toxicity. Using ectopic targeting
sequences (viral M1 protein or yeast Mas70) we stringently tar-
geted K-Ras to the ER (10) or OMM (11), the two compart-
ments upon which Bcl-xL is known to function (12). To assure
a GTP-bound conformation, the targeted constructs incorporated
an activating G12V substitution. This mutation also enabled us to
monitor the subcellular distribution of the proteins with a YFP-
tagged Raf-1 Ras binding domain (RBD) probe (YFP-RBD) that
binds with high afﬁnity to activated Ras. YFP-RBD localization
demonstrated that, whereas natively targeted K-Ras12V was
predominantly at the plasma membrane, M1–K-Ras12V was
restricted to the ER and Mas70–K-Ras12V was expressed on
mitochondria (Fig. 1A). The results with YFP-RBD also dem-
onstrated that the ectopically targeted K-Ras proteins folded
properly and retained the ability to interact with effectors.

NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts transduced under conditions of hygrom-
ycin selection for 1 wk with vector, K-Ras12V, a nonphos-
phorylatable mutant (K-Ras12V181A), or mitochondrially
targeted K-Ras (Mas70–K-Ras12V) were able to produce stable
clones that grew to conﬂuence after replating (Fig. 1B). Cells
expressing phosphomimetic K-Ras12V181E did not survive (Fig.
1B). Strikingly, cells expressing ER-targeted M1–K-Ras12V be-
haved like K-Ras12V181E–expressing cells and could not be
recovered in the clonogenic assay (Fig. 1B). The expression of all
of the K-Ras constructs was similar at 24 h after transfection
(Fig. 1B, Lower), indicating that toxicity did not correlate with
expression levels. Whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at
position 181 was required to render natively targeted K-Ras12V
toxic, ER-targeted M1–K-Ras12V did not require a phosphomi-
metic substitution for toxicity, suggesting that enforced locali-
zation on the ER is sufﬁcient. Neither was an activating G12V
mutation required as long as K-Ras carried a phosphomimetic
residue at position 181 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the ability to

cycle between GDP- and GTP-bound states remained intact. To
conﬁrm that the nucleotide-binding domain (amino acids 1–165,
G domain) of K-Ras was required for toxicity, we extended GFP
with the 20-aa C-terminal hypervariable region of K-Ras4B with
or without a phosphomimetic substitution at position 181. Nei-
ther K-Ras tail had an effect on cell survival (Fig. 1D). These
results show that phopho–K-Ras4B limits cell survival from the
ER and suggest that the GTPase interacts with Bcl-xL on
this compartment.

K-Ras Binds the C Terminus of InsP3 Receptors in an Activation,
Phosphoserine 181, and Bcl-xL–Dependent Manner. A major pro-
survival function of Bcl-xL at the ER is to bind to and sensitize
IP3Rs that mediate calcium exchange between the ER and the
mitochondrial matrix (13) where calcium is required for efﬁcient
respiration and inhibition of autophagy (14). IP3Rs span the ER
membrane six times and have large N-terminal and smaller
C-terminal domains disposed toward the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A),
both of which interact with proteins that regulate the channel
(15). The Bcl-xL binding sites on IP3R were localized to the C
terminus of the receptor (C) (13). We previously showed by
coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and FRET that K-Ras binds to
Bcl-xL in a GTP-dependent fashion, although no direct in-
teraction was demonstrated (6). Using only bacterially expressed,
recombinant proteins, we were unable to detect an interaction
between GST–Bcl-xL and 6×His–K-Ras12V181E, suggesting that
the interaction may be indirect. To determine if K-Ras binds to
IP3R in the same region as does Bcl-xL, we used an in vitro system
with GST-tagged IP3R1 C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2A) and K-Ras
proteins produced in Escherichia coli. Whereas GST–IP3R1-C was
capable of afﬁnity-purifying recombinant, activated K-Ras with a
phosphomimetic substitution at serine 181 (K-Ras12V181E), it
did not interact with either activated H-Ras61L or K-Ras12V with
a native C terminus or with an alanine substitution at residue 181
(K-Ras12V181A) (Fig. 2B, Left). These data demonstrate that
phosphomimetic K-Ras binds to the C terminus of IP3R1. Strik-
ingly, when recombinant 6×His-tagged Bcl-xL produced in Sf9
insect cells was added to the binding reaction, the amount of
K-Ras12V181E afﬁnity puriﬁed by the same amount of GST–
IP3R1-C was dramatically enhanced (Fig. 2B, Right). Longer
exposures of the immunoblot revealed that, whereas oncogenic
K-Ras with a native HVR (K-Ras12V181S) bound GST–IP3R1-C
in the presence of Bcl-xL (albeit to a lesser extent than phospho-
mimetic K-Ras12V181E), nonphosphorylatable K-Ras12V181A
did not (Fig. S3), indicating that phosphorylation promoted binding.

In contrast to the effect of Bcl-xL on K-Ras12V181E binding, the
presence of phosphomimetic K-Ras did not augment the amount
of Bcl-xL afﬁnity puriﬁed by GST–IP3R1-C (Fig. 2B, Right),

suggesting that Bcl-xL binding to the C terminus of IP3R is
permissive for K-Ras12V181E binding and promotes forma-
tion of a trimolecular complex in which both K-Ras12V181E
and Bcl-xL bind directly to IP3R.

GST–IP3R1-C could afﬁnity purify bacterially expressed K-
Ras12V181E >> K-Ras12V > K-Ras12V181A, but failed to
interact with H-Ras61L (Fig. 2C). Thus, phosphomimetic K-
Ras12V181E interacts directly with the C terminus of IP3R1.

To determine if the GTP-bound state was required for phos-
phomimetic K-Ras to interact with IP3R, we produced 6×His-
tagged K-Ras181E, which is wild type at codon 12, allowing for in
vitro loading of speciﬁc guanine nucleotides. Subsequent to pu-
riﬁcation, K-Ras181E was loaded with either the nonhydrolyzable
GDP analog GDPβS or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS.
Afﬁnity puriﬁcation of GTPγS-loaded, but not GDPβS-loaded K-
Ras181E with GST–Raf-1–RBD (Fig. 2D) demonstrated that the
recombinant proteins were properly folded, efﬁciently bound
guanine nucleotides, and behaved as expected with regard to
activation state. GST–IP3R1-C was able to afﬁnity purify GTPγS-
loaded but not GDPβS-loaded K-Ras181E in the presence of
recombinant Bcl-xL (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that only
the active form of phosphomimetic K-Ras binds to IP3R. Coim-
munoprecipitation analysis of GFP–R1–TM6+C or GFP–R1−C
plus HA–K-Ras12V181E ± HA–Bcl-xL expressed in COS-1 cells
conﬁrmed the Bcl-xL–enhanced interaction of IP3R with phos-
phomimetic K-Ras (Fig. 2E). Concordant with the in vitro results
(Fig. 2B), expression of K-Ras12V181E did not affect Bcl-xL
binding. These results suggest that the K-Ras/Bcl-xL/IP3R com-
plex forms in intact cells in which the C-terminal CAAX sequence
of K-Ras is efﬁciently processed. Whereas the ability of the
complex to form with recombinant K-Ras indicates that post-
translational processing is not required for binding, CAAX
processing in intact cells would likely be required for proper K-
Ras localization to the ER membrane where it would encounter
both Bcl-xL and IP3R.

Having demonstrated that the IP3R C terminus is sufﬁcient
for formation of the K-Ras/Bcl-XL/IP3R complex, we next sought
to determine if it is necessary. We generated a full-length (FL)
and a truncated (ΔC) form of GFP-tagged IP3R1 for use in
coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2A). GFP-IP3R1-FL but
not GFP-IP3R1-ΔC was coimmunoprecipitated by K-Ras12V181E
(Fig. 2F). These data show that the C terminus of IP3R is necessary
for the formation of the K-Ras/Bcl-xL/IP3R complex. We next
sought to demonstrate the ability of endogenous phospho–K-Ras
to bind to endogenous IP3R. The human pancreatic adeno-
carcinoma cell line, Panc-1, which harbors an activated allele
of K-Ras, was stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)
plus ionomycin to induce phosphorylation of S181. Immunopre-
cipitation of endogenous IP3R3 demonstrated a 60% increase in
K-Ras binding after PKC activation (Fig. 2G). Thus, endogenous
K-Ras interacts with endogenous IP3R, and this interaction is
augmented by treatment with a PKC agonist.

Activated Phosphomimetic K-Ras Blocks the Ability of Bcl-xL to
Sensitize IP3Rs. We previously showed by single-channel patch
clamp electrophysiology that Bcl-xL sensitized IP3Rs to the ac-
tivity of InsP3 (13, 16). We therefore tested the effects of K-Ras on
the activity of IP3R using the same method. Nuclei were isolated
from a chicken pre–B-cell line (DT40) that is null for all three
isoforms of chicken IP3Rs but is reconstituted with rat IP3R3. We
measured channel open probability (PO) in response to recombi-
nant 6×His-tagged Ras proteins (K-Ras12V, K-Ras12V181A, K-
Ras12V181E, and H-Ras61L) included in the patch pipette solu-
tion that bathes both N- and C-terminal domains of the channel,
with or without the addition of recombinant Bcl-xL (Fig. 3 A and
B). Consistent with previous work, channel gating in the presence
of subsaturating (1 μM) InsP3 was strongly enhanced by 1 μM
recombinant Bcl-xL. Interestingly, in the absence of Bcl-xL, K-
Ras12V181E but neither K-Ras12V nor K-Ras12V181A sensi-
tized the channel to low [InsP3], although to a much lesser extent
than did Bcl-xL. Strikingly, K-Ras12V and K-Ras12V181E

blocked the ability of Bcl-xL to sensitize the receptor to InsP3 (Fig.
3 A and B). In contrast, K-Ras12V181A and H-Ras61L had no
effect, indicating that the functional effect is K-Ras speciﬁc and
dependent on the residue at position 181. Similar results were
obtained using endogenous IP3R in the nuclear envelope of Sf9
cells (Fig. S4). These data show that activated phosphomimetic K-
Ras blocks an action of Bcl-xL on the IP3R that promotes cell
survival (13, 16).

To allow for CAAX processing of K-Ras and ER targeting, we
repeated these experiments in a system in which K-Ras was
expressed from a plasmid rather than included in the patch pi-
pette solution. Expression of K-Ras12V181E or M1–K-Ras12V,
but not K-Ras12V181A, by baculoviral infection of Sf9 cells,
strongly inhibited the ability of Bcl-xL to sensitize the channel to
InsP3 (Fig. 3C). Thus, both CAAX- and M1-targeted K-Ras were
able to block the action of Bcl-xL. Importantly, whereas K-
Ras12V required a phosphomimetic residue at position 181 to
block the ability of Bcl-xL to activate the channel, M1–K-
Ras12V did not, suggesting that forced localization to the ER
membrane eliminates the requirement for phosphorylation. This

result is concordant with the cell toxicity results described above
(Fig. 1B).

Because the phospho–K-Ras C-terminal “tail” was required
for the effects of K-Ras on IP3R, we next tested if the tail
alone was sufﬁcient. We synthesized 19 amino acid peptides
corresponding to the tails of K-Ras181S (wild type), K-Ras181A
(nonphosphorylatable), and K-Ras181E (phosphomimetic). Like
K-Ras, Rap1a is targeted to membranes by virtue of prenylation
and a polybasic sequence. Accordingly, a corresponding peptide
based on the Rap1a C terminus was used as an additional control.
Addition of K-Ras181E tail peptide alone did not affect IP3R
channel activity activated by 1 μM InsP3 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore,
none of the peptides added alone affected the ability of Bcl-xL to
sensitize IP3Rs. In contrast, the K-Ras181E tail peptide com-
pletely inhibited the ability of full-length K-Ras12V181E to block
the sensitizing effect of Bcl-xL (Fig. 3D). The K-Ras181S tail
peptide showed modest activity in this regard, but K-Ras181A
and Rap1a tail peptides were without effect. These data suggest
that the C-terminal peptide that corresponds to phosphomimetic
K-Ras can compete for binding of the full-length protein to the
IP3R. Because GTP-loaded K-Ras181E is required for the in-
teraction (Fig. 2D), these results suggest that both the G domain
and the C terminus participate in the binding of K-Ras12V181E
to the IP3R in the presence of Bcl-xL. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that activated, phosphomimetic K-Ras can block the
ability of Bcl-xL to sensitize the IP3R and thereby promote
cell survival.

Activated Phosphomimetic K-Ras Diminishes Mitochondrial [Ca2+].
To determine directly the effects of activated, phosphomimetic
K-Ras on [Ca2+] in the mitochondrial matrix we used mt-pericam,
a genetically encoded ﬂuorescent calcium sensor that incorporates
a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fig. 4A) (17). We coexpressed
mt-pericam in MEFs with vector, K-Ras12V, or K-Ras12V181E.
In wild-type MEFs, expression of K-Ras12V181E, and to a lesser
extent K-Ras12V, diminished mitochondrial [Ca2+] (Fig. 4 B and
C). The basal mitochondrial [Ca2+] in Bcl-xL−⁄− MEFs was similar
to that of Bcl-xL+/+ MEFs, suggesting that, in the course of ad-
aptation to growth without Bcl-xL, these cells use an alternate
means of assuring adequate delivery of calcium to the mitochon-
dria. Importantly, neither K-Ras12V nor K-Ras12V181E had
any effect on mitochondrial [Ca2+] in Bcl-xL−⁄− MEFs (Fig. 4 B
and C). When Bcl-xL was expressed exogenously in the Bcl-xL−⁄−
MEFs, they regained sensitivity to K-Ras12V and K-Ras12V181E
with regard to decreases in mitochondrial [Ca2+] (Fig. 4 B and C).
Thus, active, phosphomimetic K-Ras12V181E diminishes [Ca2+] in
the mitochondrial matrix in a Bcl-xL–dependent fashion, consis-
tent with its effects on the ability of Bcl-xL to sensitize IP3Rs.

Phospho–K-Ras Induces Autophagy in a Bcl-xL–Dependent Manner.
Because constitutive release of calcium from IP3Rs is required
to suppress autophagy (14) and because K-Ras12V181E ex-
pression altered mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, we sought to
determine if activated, phosphomimetic K-Ras induces autophagy.
Scoring for autophagy with vesicular accumulation of mCherry-
LC3 we found that Bcl-xL+/+ MEFs transfected with either K-
Ras12V181E or M1–K-Ras12V demonstrated a twofold increase
in the percent of autophagic cells over vector control (Fig. S5A).
Expression of neither K-Ras12V181E nor M1–K-Ras12V in-
creased the appearance of autophagosomes in Bcl-xL−/− cells but
ectopic expression of Bcl-xL in Bcl-xL−/− MEFs restored sensitivity
(Fig. S5A). We conﬁrmed this effect with endogenous, activated
phospho–K-Ras using the isogenic HCT116 cells described above
(Fig. S2B). HCT116 K-Ras WT and 13D cells were transfected
with mCherry-LC3 and then treated with ionomycin, PMA plus
ionomycin, or Aplog-1 (a potent analog of the PKC agonist
Bryostatin-1) (18) for 24 h (Fig. S5 B and C). HCT116 K-Ras13D
cells treated with aplog-1 revealed threefold more autophagic cells
relative to HCT116 K-Ras WT cells (Fig. S5 B and C). Trans-
mission electron micrographs conﬁrmed that Aplog-1–treated cells
contained double-membrane–bound autophagosomes (Fig. S5D).

Atg5+/− MEFs heterozygous for the critical autophagy gene Atg5
(19) were partially protected from K-Ras12V181E-mediated
toxicity (Fig. S5E). These results suggest that expression of
phosphomimetic, oncogenic Ras induces autophagy, which in
turn is required for poor survival.

Discussion
The observation that PKC agonists induce rapid translocation of
K-Ras4B from the plasma membrane to intracellular compart-
ments led to the discovery that this Ras isoform can be phos-
phorylated in its membrane targeting domain (6). A large body
of evidence supports a model whereby the polybasic region of K-
Ras4B contributes to membrane afﬁnity through an electrostatic
interaction with the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (4, 5,
20, 21). Phosphorylation of serine 181 sufﬁciently weakens this
interaction to cause K-Ras4B to dissociate from the plasma
membrane. Since the initial report of this farnesyl-electrostatic
switch (6), other small GTPases that associate with membranes
via polybasic regions that operate in conjunction with pre-
nylation, including RalA (22) and Rnd3 (23), have been shown
to be substrates for kinases that modulate membrane association
through a similar prenyl-electrostatic switch.

The accumulation of phospho–K-Ras on endomembrane may
reﬂect the fact that CAAX proteins that lack a second signal
(palmitoylation or a polybasic region) accumulate on ER and
Golgi (4, 24, 25). More surprising than the endomembrane lo-
calization of phospho–K-Ras4B was the observation that its
translocation was associated with cell death (6). The localization
of phospho–K-Ras4B on the OMM suggested that cell toxicity
might be related to apoptosis; however, the requirement for Bcl-
xL for phospho–K-Ras4B–mediated toxicity clouded the picture
considerably. The results reported here explain the earlier ﬁnd-
ings. Using multiple well-established assays, we determined that
expression of phosphomimetic K-Ras12V181E did not activate
the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Nevertheless, a
clonogenic assay revealed that phosphomimetic K-Ras4B limits
cell survival. Using K-Ras4B constructs stringently targeted to
various subcellular compartments, we found that the toxicity of
K-Ras12V181E depended on its localization at the ER and could
not be elicited by targeting it to the OMM.

In addition to inhibiting proapoptotic proteins that act at mito-
chondria to induce permeability transition, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have
well-established antiapoptotic activities at the ER, albeit through
distinct mechanisms (12). High levels of calcium leaking from the
ER into the cytoplasm can initiate cell death through a variety of
mechanisms that include triggering of OMM permeabilization to
induce apoptosis (26, 27) and activation of calpain and other
proteases to induce necrosis (28, 29). Bcl-2 can inhibit this rela-
tively high leak into the cytoplasm by binding to the N terminus of
IP3Rs and negatively regulating the channels (30, 31). Conversely,
calcium ﬂux from the ER to the mitochondria through IP3Rs is
essential for mitochondrial respiratory function and cell survival.
Bcl-xL binds to the C terminus of IP3Rs and sensitizes them for
calcium transfer to mitochondria (13, 14, 16). The involvement of the
ER and Bcl-xL in the toxicity of phosphomimetic K-Ras12V181E
suggested that interference with mitochondrial calcium homeostasis
might underlie the mechanism of toxicity.

We show that K-Ras4B interacts directly with the C terminus
of IP3R. This is the same region to which Bcl-xL binds, sensi-
tizing the receptor to InsP3 and thereby enhancing cell survival
(13, 14, 16). The interaction of K-Ras4B with IP3R requires it
to be GTP bound, and it is enhanced when a phosphomimetic
group is incorporated at residue 181. The requirement for GTP-
binding suggests that the GTPase effector domain is involved in
the interaction. However, the enhancement with a phosphomi-
metic and the ability of a peptide based on the C terminus of K-
Ras4B to block the functional interaction with IP3R suggest that
the interaction also depends on the C terminus of K-Ras4B.
Perhaps most intriguing is the observation that this interaction
is markedly enhanced in the presence of Bcl-xL. We previously
reported that Bcl-xL could be coimmunoprecipitated with
phospho–K-Ras4B (6); however, the afﬁnity was low and no
direct interaction was documented. Using a fully recombinant
system, we found no evidence for a direct interaction between
K-Ras4B and Bcl-xL. Thus, it appears that Bcl-xL interacts in-
directly with K-Ras4B in a trimolecular complex with the C ter-
minus of IP3R. Moreover, our data support a model whereby the
binding of K-Ras4B to IP3R is greatly facilitated by prior binding
of Bcl-xL, but the converse is not true. Thus, Bcl-xL binding to
IP3R acts to allosterically regulate K-Ras4B binding.

The functional effects of these interactions on IP3R channel
activity observed by nuclear patch clamp electrophysiology are
entirely consistent with the binding data. The addition of
recombinant phosphomimetic K-Ras12V181E protein to the
patch pipette solution or overexpressing K-Ras12V181E in the
cell before patch clamping the nuclear envelope blocked com-
pletely the ability of Bcl-xL to sensitize IP3Rs to InsP3. In contrast,
Ras12V181A had no such effect, demonstrating that the phos-
phomimetic residue is required. Thus, K-Ras12V181E binding to
IP3R, an interaction facilitated by prior binding of Bcl-xL, blocks
the prosurvival action of Bcl-xL on IP3R activity. This model
was further supported by the observation that expression of
Ras12V181E, but not Ras12V181A, led to decreased levels of
mitochondrial [Ca2+] in a Bcl-xL–dependent fashion.

Autophagy is a cellular process that evolved to promote cell
survival by providing a way to derive energy and essential
nutrients from the breakdown of excess cytoplasmic components
(32). Calcium signaling is an important mechanism that regulates
autophagy (33). We recently showed that the constitutive ﬂux of
calcium from the ER to mitochondria through IP3Rs is essential
to suppress autophagy under conditions of abundant nutrients
(14). The inhibition of this transfer by Ras12V181E can there-
fore account for the observed stimulation of autophagy in cells
expressing Ras12V181E. In this context, the requirement for
Atg5 for Ras12V181E-mediated toxicity may seem paradoxical.
However, autophagy has also be associated with programmed
cell death (34, 35) and our data suggest that autophagy caused by
expression of phospho–K-Ras4B in the presence of Bcl-xL may
play a role in limiting cell survival.

Effectors of small GTPases like K-Ras4B are deﬁned as pro-
teins that preferentially bind to the GTP-bound form of the

GTPase and, in so doing, undergo a functional change. Our data
therefore establish IP3Rs as previously unappreciated effectors
of K-Ras4B. The restriction of IP3Rs to the ER offers yet an-
other example of spatially regulated Ras signaling (36). Most
pathways regulated by Ras proteins promote cell survival
and growth, although alternative signaling for cell death is
a well-described paradigm (37). The fact that phosho–K-
Ras4B signaling through IP3Rs at the ER promotes cell death
suggests that this pathway could be exploited to develop
anticancer therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Clonogenic Survival Assay. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and cultured in se-
lection media for at least 7 d. Cell survival was assessed by visual inspection.
Colonies were dispersed by trypsinization and replating to produce a con-
ﬂuent monolayer suitable for imaging. Cells were imaged by phase contrast
with a 10× objective using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).

Afﬁnity Puriﬁcation. GST-tagged proteins immobilized on beads were equiva-
lently added to 1 mL of 1 mg/mL Sf9 lysate with or without Bcl-xL expression.
Recombinant Ras was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 nM. Beads were
washed with PBS + 1% Tx-100 and eluted in 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples
were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblot.

10 mM Hepes, pH 7.1. Ras baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac
baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Tail peptides were synthesized
and HPLC puriﬁed by Genemed Synthesis and stored in TBS. Data were ac-
quired using an Axopatch-1D ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments), and single-
channel analysis was performed using QuB software (University of Buffalo).

Mt-Pericam Microscopy. MEFs were cotransfected in a 4:1 ratio of the in-
dicated pCGN plasmid to pcDNA3.1-mt-pericam [a gift from D. Clapham
(Harvard Medical School, Boston) with permission from A. Miyawaki (Riken
Brain Science Institute, Tokyo)]. Fluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss
LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope using a 63× objective. Mt-pericam
ﬂuorescence was excited with 405-nm and 488-nm lasers and detected at
515 nm according to published methods (38). Ratio images of ﬂuorescent
intensity (488/405) were generated and average ratio intensities of single
cells were quantiﬁed using MetaMorph.

LC3 Translocation Assay. Cells were cotransfected in a 4:1 ratio of the indicated
pCGN plasmid to pCherry-LC3. Four hours posttransfection, cells were treated
with or without the indicated compounds (10 mM 3-methyladenine, 250 ng/mL
ionomycin ± 50 ng/mL PMA, or 10 μM Aplog-1). Twenty-four hours after
drug treatment, cells were ﬁxed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) and mounted on glass slides. Cells were scored positive
for nuclear clearing of pCherry-LC3 or presence of >10 autophagic puncta.

Electrophysiology. DT40 and Sf9 cells were suspended in a nuclear isolation
solution containing 150 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1.5 mM β-mercaptoe-
thanol, 10 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 0.05 mM PMSF, and a protease inhibitor
mixture (Roche). Nuclei were isolated using a Dounce glass homogenizer
and plated onto a 1-mL glass bottomed dish containing standard bath so-
lution [140 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, and 0.5 mM BAPTA (free [Ca2+] = 300
