ABSTRACT: Neuroﬁbromatosis type-1 (NF1) is associ-
ated with the growth of benign and malignant tumors.
Approximately 15% of NF1 patients develop malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), underlin-
ing the need to identify speciﬁc diagnostic/prognostic
biomarkers associated with MPNST development. The
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single-nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) Array 6.0 was used to perform SNP
genotyping and copy number alteration (CNA), loss-of-
heterozygosity (LOH), and copy number neutral–LOH
(CNN–LOH) analyses of DNA isolated from 15 MPN-
STs, ﬁve benign plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PNFs), and
patient-matched lymphocyte DNAs. MPNSTs exhibited
high-level CNN-LOH, with recurrent changes occurring
in MPNSTs but not PNFs. CNN–LOH was evident
in MPNSTs but occurred less frequently than genomic
deletions. CNAs involving the ITGB8, PDGFA, Ras-
related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) (7p21-
p22), PDGFRL (8p22-p21.3), and matrix metallopep-
tidase 12 (MMP12) (11q22.3) genes were speciﬁc to
MPNSTs. Pathway analysis revealed the MPNST-speciﬁc
ampliﬁcation of seven Rho–GTPase pathway genes and
several cytoskeletal remodeling/cell adhesion genes. In
knockdown experiments employing short-hairpin RAC1,
ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 RNAs to transfect both con-
trol and MPNST-derived cell lines, cell adhesion was sig-
niﬁcantly increased in the MPNST cell lines, whereas
wound healing, cell migration, and invasiveness were re-
duced, consistent with a role for these Rho–GTPase path-
way genes in MPNST development and metastasis. These

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type-1 (NF1; MIM# 162200) is a familial can-
cer syndrome that affects one in 3,500 individuals worldwide. It is
caused by inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene (MIM#
162200) located at 17q11.2. Consistent with Knudson’s two-hit hy-
pothesis, NF1 patients harboring a heterozygous germline NF1
mutation develop neuroﬁbromas upon somatic mutation of the
second wild-type NF1 allele. The benign and malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) that develop in NF1 patients
are a hallmark of the disease, with cutaneous neuroﬁbromas be-
ing the commonest benign tumors, and MPNSTs, a type of sar-
coma, contributing to malignancy [Bennett et al., 2009; Upadhyaya
and Cooper, 1998; reviewed by Upadhyaya, 2010]. NF1 individuals
are predisposed to develop a variety of other cancers, such as op-
tic gliomas, pheochromocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors,
and myeloid malignancies. NF1 is also characterized by a plethora of
nontumor clinical features, including dermal pigmentary changes,
hamartomatous lesions of the iris, bone deformities, and cognitive
deﬁcit.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type-1 patients exhibit an 8–13% lifetime risk
of developing an MPNST, usually from within a preexisting plex-
iform neuroﬁbroma (PNF) or a focal subcutaneous neuroﬁbroma
[Brems et al., 2009a; Evans et al., 2002; Spurlock et al., 2010; Tucker
et al., 2005 & Carrolle & Ratner, 2008]. Although most MPNSTs
develop in adult NF1 patients, they can also occur in much younger
affected individuals, emphasizing the need for early detection of
MPNST development given that these aggressive tumors frequently
recur and can metastasize to the lungs and other organs. Radical

surgery, usually in combination with radiotherapy, constitutes the
optimum treatment, especially if chemotherapy is also given in par-
allel to inhibit metastasis. Although early detection would facili-
tate both the identiﬁcation and clinical management of those NF1
patients most likely to develop malignant tumors, a prerequisite
for early detection is the availability of diagnostic and prognos-
tic biomarkers associated with MPNST development [reviewed by
Upadhyaya, 2011].

The difﬁculties inherent in the early clinical and pathological di-
agnosis of NF1–MPNSTs underline the need for a clearer deﬁnition
of the molecular basis of NF1-associated malignancy. Somatic bial-
lelic inactivation of both NF1 alleles was ﬁrst demonstrated in NF1–
MPNSTs more than 20 years ago [Skuse et al., 1989], an observation
consistent with NF1 being a tumor suppressor gene. Homozygous
NF1 inactivation was also subsequently detected in benign cuta-
neous and PNFs as well as in MPNSTs when loss-of-heterozygosity
(LOH) analysis was performed [Glover et al., 1991; John et al., 2000;
Legius et al., 1993; Rasmussen et al., 2000], indicating that addi-
tional genetic changes are required for malignant transformation to
occur.

Although the functional loss of neuroﬁbromin represents the
primary event in tumorigenesis, the precise role of other genetic
lesions in promoting the malignant transformation of benign neu-
roﬁbromas is poorly understood. However, the recent introduction
of microarray-based technologies allows us to simultaneously an-
alyze multiple genes and genomic regions (at both the RNA and
DNA level) in a single experiment. Such array-based analyses pro-
vide us with an unrivaled opportunity to proﬁle concomitant copy
number and gene expression changes associated with a given tumor
state. Several studies have already analyzed tumor DNA and/or RNA
in searches for potential molecular signatures capable of differen-
tiating between MPNSTs and benign neuroﬁbromas [Miller et al.,
2006, 2010; Mantripragada et al., 2008, 2009; reviewed by Upad-
hyaya, 2011]. Array-based analyses have a major advantage in that
they can be used to detect copy number variation/alterations, which
can play a key role in tumorigenesis. Copy number variants (CNVs)
constitute heritable genomic alterations that range in size from one
kilobase up to several megabases in size. Although CNVs make a
substantial contribution to interindividual variation, acquired so-
matic copy number alterations (CNAs) are increasingly being iden-
tiﬁed in many different cancers [Albertson, 2006; Kuiper et al., 2010;
Rothenberg and Settleman, 2010; Shlien and Malkin, 2009, 2010].
As with other tumor-associated genetic changes, such CNAs (by
virtue of the genes they contain) can confer a selective advantage
with respect to cellular proliferation, survival, and clonal expan-
sion. Various microarray-based methodologies have been developed
to detect both CNVs and CNAs genome wide. Initially, compara-
tive genomic hybridization arrays (array-CGH) constructed from
overlapping human bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) clones
were recruited, but more recently, combined high-density single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and CNV genotyping arrays have
been employed. Such high-density microarrays, often containing
several million individual markers, can now be used to simulta-
neously assess both heritable copy number variation and somatic
CNA-based genomic changes associated with a speciﬁc tumor type
[Lebron et al., 2011].

Recent studies of NF1-associated benign and malignant tu-
mors, which have aimed to identify tumor-speciﬁc diagnostic and
prognostic markers, have detected extensive somatic copy number
changes in DNA derived from NF1–MPNSTs that were absent from
the DNA of benign PNFs [Kresse et al., 2008; Mantripragada et al.,
2008, 2009]. The present study has extended this analysis by provid-
ing high-resolution information from a combined genomic CNA

analysis with data from an LOH screen of both PNF and MPNST
tumor DNAs from 20 unrelated NF1 patients using the Affymetrix
Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array.

Materials and Methods

Patient Samples and DNA Preparation

This project was approved by the local Ethics committee. In-
formed consent for sample collection was obtained according to
protocols approved by this committee. Diagnosis of MPNSTs was
made by the individual referring centers. All available information
on the nature and grading of the tumors under study (15 MPNSTs)
is provided in Supp. Table S1. Tumor biopsies and matched lym-
phocyte samples were obtained from the 20 unrelated NF1 patients.
DNA from the tumors and matched lymphocyte samples was ex-
tracted as previously described [Upadhyaya et al., 2008a, 2008b].
DNA samples were checked to ensure compliance with the strin-
gent spectrophotometric and electrophoretic quality control (QC)
criteria required by the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array platform.

Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array Analysis

The Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 was used
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. This Affymetrix array offers
whole-genome coverage as well as superior resolution, and permits
the simultaneous assessment of unbalanced chromosomal defects
such as CNA, LOH, and acquired copy number neutral (CNN)–
LOH. Details are given in the Supp. Methods.

Genomic Segmentation algorithms or Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) (Affymetrix White Paper; http://www.affymetrix.com/
support/technical/whitepapers.affx) were used to detect the copy
number variation. The minimal number of genomic markers was
set at 50 for both algorithms. Most copy number analysis was per-
formed using the segmentation method, with the P value threshold
set at 0.001 and a signal-to-noise ratio of ≥0.5, to attain the level
required for positive CNA detection. In these copy number analyses,
overlapping CNA regions were identiﬁed on the basis of the overlap
of physical location intervals at each CNA boundary, either in NF1–
MPNSTs or benign PNFs. All CNA and LOH analyses, including
CNN–LOH, were performed in Partek Genomics Suite 6.4. Most
CNA analysis entailed paired analysis involving the comparison of
tumor DNAs against the matched constitutional patient lymphocyte
DNAs, whereas unpaired CNA analysis was only used in median ab-
solute pairwise difference (MAPD) calculation and QC to compare
tumor DNA against reference data derived from the 270 normal indi-
viduals catalogued in the HapMap database (International HapMap
Consortium, 2005). All LOH and CNN–LOH analyses were paired
using matched lymphocyte DNAs as the baseline. Each positive
tumor-speciﬁc CNA was assessed to determine the genomic region,
overlap, or recurrence between samples, as well as the identity of
the genes residing within the corresponding genomic regions. For
CNN–LOH analysis, two separate workﬂows were used. One of these
was the allele-speciﬁc copy number (ASCN) analysis in Partek that
used both the CEL ﬁles containing probe intensity data and CHP
ﬁles containing SNP call results together to assess copy number allele
imbalance. The other workﬂow involved the comparison of paired
CNV analysis using CEL ﬁles and paired LOH analysis (using both
CEL ﬁles and CHP ﬁles) to identify regions with CNVs and LOH,
respectively, and then to identify regions of CNN–LOH. The results
from the two separate workﬂows were then merged, generating a
consensus in CNN–LOH identiﬁcation. Biological pathway analysis
was performed in GeneGO’s MetaCore (http://www.genego.com)

using gene set enrichment analysis in conjunction with the gene
lists from the corresponding CNA regions or LOH regions.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction

From the derived Affymetrix array CGH data in the present study,
the relative copy numbers of 14 genes found to be encompassed by
tumor-speciﬁc CNAs were independently assessed by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of DNA and RNA isolated from
the relevant tumor samples. The details are given in the Supporting
Information.

Details of the short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) experiments, cell cul-
ture, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, the wound healing
assay, and the cell adhesion, invasion, and migration assays are given

Results

Data Quality Assessment

In the present study, we analyzed the copy number and LOH
state in DNA isolated from tumors and matched constitutional
(lymphocyte) samples from 20 NF1 patients (including 15 MP-
NSTs and ﬁve PNFs) using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. (NB.
Throughout the text, the preﬁx M denotes MPNST, whereas the
preﬁx P denotes PNF.) Because LOH and CNN–LOH analyses re-
quire satisfactory genotyping performance and consistent intensity
measurement across genomic regions, we examined the SNP call
rate to assess genotyping performance, MAPD to assess the suit-
ability for using unpaired copy number analysis against the 794
normal HapMap samples (Supp. Fig. S1a–c), and principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis for sample grouping
and detection of sample outliers. Apart from one lymphocyte sam-
ple (patient M6) that failed to yield DNA of sufﬁcient quality, all
39 samples successfully yielded data. The SNP call rates for 36 of
the 39 arrays analyzed were 97–99%, and were therefore suitable
for LOH analysis. The remaining three arrays yielded SNP call rates
of 96.0–96.8% with acceptable genotyping performance and were
therefore also included in the data analysis. All 39 DNA hybridiza-
tions yielded good MAPD scores, 0.23–0.37 (<0.4), thereby meeting
the acceptance criterion for copy number analysis.

The clustering analysis (Fig. 1a and b) of copy numbers from
the unpaired and paired analyses indicated that the MPNSTs repre-
sented a diverse group, with some samples (M10, M11, M12, M13,
and M14) resembling PNF samples in terms of their copy num-
ber changes, whereas others (such as M2, M3, M7, M8, M9, and
MX) were quite distinct from the PNF samples. After reviewing the
PCA and clustering analysis results of copy numbers from the un-
paired analysis, an apparent batch effect related to scan date (data
production date) was noted. Three arrays, corresponding to M14
tumor and lymphocyte samples and M9 tumor samples produced
on September 16, 2008 (Supp. Fig. S1a) deviated signiﬁcantly from
the rest of data due to the scan date batch effect. Although the paired
analysis (Fig. 1a) placed M14 in the middle of the cluster, because
both its tumor and matched lymphocyte samples were from the
same batch, M9 would appear to be an outlier in the paired analysis
because its tumor sample was proﬁled in the batch of September 16,
2008, but its matched reference lymphocyte sample was made in the
other batch (August 28, 2008). Therefore, M9 was not used for any
sample overlap and recurrent CNA analysis.

The genome-wide CNA/CNV proﬁles associated with each tumor
type and the matching lymphocyte DNA from the same patient were
visualized using the heatmaps generated from hierarchical cluster-

ing analysis in Partek Genomics Suite 6.4. Each CNA proﬁle was
presented as a “heatmap” that depicted the copy number changes
associated with each of the 23 chromosomes. As an example, the
CNA heatmap for chromosome 5 is shown for the 13 MPNST tu-
mor samples (top panel) and ﬁve PNF tumor samples pairwise in
Figure 2; this serves to identify all copy number gains (in red) and all
copy number losses (in blue) across the entire length of chromosome
5. Five PNF-harboring patients (bottom panel) displayed relatively
few copy number changes, whereas the CNA proﬁles derived from
ﬁve MPNSTs (top panel, M2, M3, M5, M6, M7, M8, and MX) were
generally comparable (with genomic gains across the entire 5p arm
and genomic losses across the 5q arm). However, the CNA proﬁles
from several other MPNSTs (M4, M10, M11, M12, and M13) were
quite varied, with several displaying CNA proﬁles with respect to
chromosome 5 that were similar to those exhibited by benign PNFs.
The genome-wide CNA proﬁles associated with the MPNSTs dis-
played a similar trend; however, these molecular proﬁles harbored
two subgroups of malignant tumors, those that exhibited a large
number of CNAs and those which exhibited relatively few CNA
proﬁles and were comparable to the proﬁles characterizing benign
PNFs (Figs. 1a and 2).

CNV/CNA Identiﬁcation by Paired and Unpaired Analysis

To determine whether any of the identiﬁed CNAs were speciﬁc to
either the PNFs or the malignant MPNSTs, all tumor CNVs/CNAs
were compared with the CNV proﬁles derived from the matched
lymphocyte DNA samples from the same patients, as well as against
the CNV proﬁles of the 794 normal HapMap samples. The Database
of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) was queried
for all CNV/CNA-harboring regions identiﬁed in the tumor and
blood samples in order to exclude the possibility that they might
constitute rare CNVs found in the normal population rather than
true somatic events. To identify signiﬁcant CNAs, we employed the
criteria of 50 or more markers, a P value of 0.001 and a signal-to-
noise ratio of no less than 0.5 for segmentation analysis. The CNA
distributions in 14 MPNST and ﬁve PNF patients are summarized in
Table 1 and Supp. Tables S2 and S3 for both the paired and unpaired
analyses. The detailed results for individual patients are presented
in Supp. Table S4. It would appear that CNAs in MPNSTs are much
more frequent than in PNFs in the paired analysis (Table 1, Supp.
Fig. S2a and b). The unpaired analysis yielded more CNAs in some
samples than the paired analysis (Table 1), indicating that germline
CNVs were evident in the unpaired analysis but not in the paired
analysis. These results from the unpaired analysis did not include the
X and Y chromosomes because the genders of individuals from the
HapMap samples were different from those of the NF1 patients and
hence inclusion of the sex chromosomes would have rendered the
CNA analysis invalid. Therefore, the primary results and conclusion
were based solely on the paired analysis. The unpaired analysis
was mainly used to assess the difference between the somatic and
germline changes. Among the results of the paired analysis, 41 CNAs
had copy numbers greater than 4 or less than 0.5; 40 of these high-
magnitude changes occurred in MPNST patients M2, M3, M7, M8,
and MX including 13 ampliﬁcations on 18q21.2 in patient M3, two
deletions on 17p11.2 in patient M2, and three deletions on 11p12
in MX. Only one ampliﬁcation event was found in a PNF (P1 on
12p11.1).

Deletions and Ampliﬁcations

Of the total 1,022 CNVs/CNAs identiﬁed, there were more
copy number losses (571; 55.87%) than copy number gains (451;

44.13%). Most CNAs (996/1022) were identiﬁed in MPNST tumor
DNA, whereas only 26 CNAs were identiﬁed in benign PNF tumor
DNA (Supp. Table S3). Recurrent or overlapping CNVs/CNAs were
absent from PNFs (Supp. Table S3), except for one overlap on chro-
mosome 4 in two patients, P1 and P3. Identiﬁcation of the CNAs
most likely to be involved in malignant transformation required the
selection of recurrent CNAs (i.e., those CNAs found in at least three
different MPNSTs from unrelated patients, and with copy number
gains of ≥2.8 or losses of ≤1.5); employing these criteria, a total of
232 CNVs were selected for further analysis (all were among the
MPNSTs because no such recurrent CNAs were observed among
the benign PNFs). A subsequent assessment of the 232 recurrent
MPNST-associated CNAs identiﬁed at least 2,972 genes that were
contained within, or overlapped with, these variant genomic regions
(Supp. Table S4, overlapping genes).

LOH Analysis and CNN–LOH analysis

The 19 pairs of samples were used to identify regions with CNN
changes. Patient M6 was excluded owing to the lack of sufﬁcient

matched lymphocyte sample. In LOH analysis, a matched refer-
ence is required to eliminate potentially confounding genotypic
differences from the reference sample. Two approaches were used to
identify CNN changes (uniparental disomy) using Partek Genomics
Suite 6.4. First, CNN–LOH was analyzed to identify regions where
LOH was identiﬁed, yet total copy number equalled 2. Second, the
ASCN was performed to identify CNN allele imbalance.

The 19 pairs of samples (corresponding to DNAs from 14 MP-
NSTs and ﬁve PNFs) were used in LOH analysis with the individu-
ally matched lymphocyte DNAs serving as reference samples in the
paired analysis (Table 2).

Loss-of-heterozygosity results were obtained from paired analyses
of matched tumor and lymphocyte DNAs from each patient using
the SNP probe set in the Affymetrix SNP6.0 array. MPNST DNAs
exhibited a higher level of LOH (with a considerable number of
overlapping regions) as compared with benign tumors.

In total, 7,643 LOH regions were found that exhibited a heterozy-
gosity rate of zero for at least two SNP markers. Supp. Table S3
summarizes the results obtained in LOH analysis and illustrates the
very high levels of LOH exhibited by MPNST DNA as compared

displayed relatively few copy number changes, whereas the CNA proﬁles derived from ﬁve MPNSTs (top panel, M2, M3, M5, M6, M7, M8, and MX)
were generally comparable (with genomic gains across the entire 5p arm and genomic losses across the 5q arm). However, the CNA proﬁles from

were similar to those exhibited by benign PNFs.

with the general lack of LOH, evident in benign PNF tumor DNAs.
Among the MPNST DNA samples, a considerable number of over-
lapping LOH regions were observed, with at least 450 overlapping
regions identiﬁed in ﬁve tumors and 40 overlapping regions identi-
ﬁed in six tumors. In contrast, no overlap in LOH was found among

the benign PNF tumors. In the paired copy number analysis, the 19
pairs of samples were used in HMM copy number analysis using
their matched lymphocyte samples as a reference and a threshold of
at least 50 SNP markers for a positive CNA to be ascertained. In the
output of HMM copy number analysis, 1,310 regions with a copy

number of 2 and a P value of ∼1.00 were then subsequently merged
with the 7,643 LOH regions to identify overlaps. In total, 9,188 over-
lapping regions of potential CNN–LOH were identiﬁed. Following
ﬁltration of these 9,188 regions with a 0% heterozygosity call rate
and the requirement for a minimum of 50 SNP markers in each re-
gion, the number of CNN–LOH regions was reduced to 512 because
a majority of the LOH regions had fewer than 50 SNP markers. By
further applying the criterion that each region must either occur in
at least two unrelated patients, the CNN–LOH regions were reduced
to 71 (CNN–LOH regions detected in two to four patients). The 71
identiﬁed regions were variously located on chromosomes 1, 4, 5,
9, 16, 17, 18, and X. The CNN allele imbalance approach was also
applied in the analysis. Paired copy number analysis was performed
using segmentation on the 19 pairs of samples. With the segmenta-
tion algorithms, at least 50 SNP markers, a P value of 0.001, and a
signal-to-noise ratio of 0.5 set as threshold; 599 regions were found
to have a P value of ∼1.00 or were unchanged in copy number in the
segmentation. In the SCNA analysis, 3,768 regions are detected for
SCNA imbalance. By overlapping the 599 CNVs from the total copy
number analysis with the 3,768 regions from the SCNA analysis, we
identiﬁed 578 regions of CNN imbalance with recurrence in two
or more patients. Most of the 578 regions were identiﬁed in ﬁve or
more patients.

Identiﬁcation of Potential Genes Associated with MPNST
Development

Biologicalpathwayanalysis

A variety of genes were contained within those CNAs that were
found exclusively in MPNSTs. These included ITGB8 (7p15.3),

PDGFA and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1)
(7p22), PDGFRB (5q31-q32), and matrix metallopeptidase 12
(MMP12) (11q22.3). A biological pathway analysis was performed
on the 1,521 genes that were associated with MPNST-speciﬁc CNAs,
as identiﬁed by the MetaCore database (http://www.genego.com/
metacore.php). MetaCore is an integrated software suite designed
for the pathway analysis of array experimental data. The speciﬁc
pathways deemed to be potentially involved are listed in Table 3
and Supp. Table S5, together with the map name, cell process, and
hypergeometric P value found in the present study and in the entire
pathway.

The details of these individual pathways are given in Supp. Fig-
ure S3. The main conclusion from this analysis was that the genomic
aberrations present exclusively in MPNST DNA comprise both spe-
ciﬁc CNAs and widespread LOH, whereas no such genomic changes
were evident in DNA from any benign PNF tumor.

A similar biological pathway assessment was undertaken on the
543 genes shown to be consistently affected by informative LOH
changes in DNA from at least ﬁve MPNSTs from unrelated pa-
tients. The top 10 pathways identiﬁed are listed in Table 3. Many of
these pathways are involved with cell growth, cell adhesion, signal
transduction, and the immune response, and are therefore broadly
representative of the systems frequently found to be involved in
tumorigenesis and metastasis. This study has therefore identiﬁed a
number of genes with potential links to the process of NF1 tumori-
genesis, including genes directly involved in cytoskeletal remodel-
ing and cell adhesion. For example, at least seven members of the
Rho–GTPase gene family known to mediate cytoskeletal remodeling
(ACTB, ACTG1, LIMK1, PRKCA, PTK2, RAC1, and ROCK2) (Supp.
Fig. S3) were found to be associated with recurrent copy number
gains in MPNST DNA. In addition, both ACTB and ACTG1 are cy-
toplasmic actin genes. Hence, their increased expression (as a likely
consequence of gene duplication) may inﬂuence either the motility
or the invasive properties of affected tumor cells (Table 3 and Supp.
Table S5).

The relationship between copy number changes and gene ex-
pression was assessed by qPCR and a correlation was noted for the
majority (∼90%) of the genes analyzed (Supp. Fig. S4a and b). All
CNAs identiﬁed in this analysis were conﬁrmed by real-time (RT)
qPCR and at least seven genes in the Rho–GTPase pathway were
found to be ampliﬁed (Supp. Fig. S4b). Four of these seven Rho–
GTPase pathway genes have been shown to be involved in some of
the features of NF1 tumorigenesis, namely, wound healing, cellular

adhesion, migration, and invasion in this study. Alteration of the
Rho–GTPase-encoding RAC1 gene has been identiﬁed in multiple
solid cancer types including testicular, gastric, and breast cancer
in addition to chronic myelogenous leukemia and primary human
schwannoma cells [Harnois et al., 2003; Kaempchen et al., 2003].

Immunohistochemistry

For all four proteins, RAC1, ROCK2, LIMK1, and PTK2, greater
intensity of cytoplasmic staining was observed in MPNSTs versus
benign neuroﬁbromas, both cutaneous and plexiform (data not
shown). This ﬁnding is consistent with the results obtained by array
and qPCR analysis. In neuroﬁbromas, the vast majority of nuclei,
blood vessels, and mast cells were stained, whereas in MPNST few
nuclei were stained. The pattern of staining was similar for all four
proteins in both the tumor types (data not shown) [Bartley & Ross,
2002].

ExploringtheinvolvementofRAC1,ROCK2,PTK2,andLIMK1
inwoundhealingandcelladhesion,migration,andinvasion

RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 were selected for further func-
tional studies not only because they are key members of the Rho–
GTPase pathway and have been implicated in many cancers [Malliri
and Collard, 2003] but also because MPNST-speciﬁc copy number
gains were observed for these genes. In addition, shRNAs for these
four genes have been fully validated. All three MPNST cell lines
ST8814, 507.1, and T529 used in this study exhibited copy number
gains and overexpression of these genes (data not shown).

Wound healing is an intricate process in which the skin (or an-
other organ–tissue) repairs itself after injury. In order to explore the
potential role of the overexpression of RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and
LIMK1 on wound healing, cells transfected with RAC1, ROCK2,
PTK2, and LIMK1 knockdowns and scrambled control shRNA were
seeded onto laminin and wounded with a pipette tip. Between 0 and
12 hr after wounding, the cells migrated across the wound. Wound
healing was reduced in RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 knock-
down cells by comparison with control scrambled shRNA (Fig. 3a;
data for PTK2 and LIMK1 provided in Supp. Fig. S5a and b). Owing
to the kinetics of wound healing, healing was deemed to be com-
plete when no gap was observed in all shRNA cell lines by 24 hr,
although healing occurred earlier (12–16 hr) in the control cell line
than in the RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 knockdown cell lines
(16–24 hr). The above experiment was repeated on a further three
cell lines (ST8814, 507.1, and T529). All experiments were repeated
a minimum of three times and the results generated from each of
the three experiments were in concordance. MPNST cell doubling
time is approximately 20.44 hr (ST8814) [Vahidnia et al. 2007].
Wound healing is unlikely to have been affected by cell proliferation
as wound healing was observed by 12 hr in the scrambled control
cell line.

Cell adhesion is a complex mechanism involved in a variety of pro-
cesses including cell migration and invasion, embryogenesis, wound
healing, and tissue remodeling. In order to explore the potential role
of the overexpression of RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 on cell
adhesion, cells were transfected with RAC1 and ROCK2 knockdown
and control shRNAs on both laminin and ﬁbronectin, and PTK2 and
LIMK1 with control shRNA on laminin. Adhesion was signiﬁcantly
increased in cell lines containing RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1
knockdowns (P = 0.02, P = 0.05, P = 0.001, and P = 0.002, respectively)
by comparison with cell lines transfected with the scrambled control
shRNA (Fig. 3b) (data for PTK2 and LIMK1 in Supp. Fig. S4a and
b). RAC1 knockdown resulted in greater cell adhesion than ROCK2

knockdown, and LIMK1 knockdown resulted in greater cell adhe-
sion than PTK2 knockdown. However, these differences were not
statistically signiﬁcant, P = 0.07 and P = 0.12, respectively. Adhesion
on ﬁbronectin appeared to be more efﬁcient than that on laminin in
cell lines harboring both RAC1 and ROCK2 knockdowns, but again
this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.20).

Cell migration is a highly integrated, multistep process that plays
an important role in the progression of cancer. In order to explore
the potential role of the overexpression of RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2,
and LIMK1 on cell migration, the migration of cells transfected
with RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 and control shRNA was
assessed by seeding the cells onto polycarbonate membranes [de
Pril et al., 2009]. Cell migration was signiﬁcantly reduced in RAC1,
ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 knockdown cell lines in comparison
with cells transfected with a scrambled vector (P = 0.05, P = 0.03,
P = 0.025, and P = 0.027, respectively) (Fig. 3c). The reduction
in migration was similar in cells that were transfected with RAC1,
ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 (Fig. 3C) (data for PTK2 and LIMK1 in
Supp. Fig. S5). Approximately 40% reduction in cell migration was
observed in 80% knockdowns of RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1
and approximately 25% reduction in 50% knockdowns of RAC1,
ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1. Results were representative of all cell
lines and replicates (ST8814, 507.1, and T529).

Tumor cell invasion into the basement membrane is an impor-
tant step in the multistep process of tumor metastasis. The potential
role of the overexpression of RAC1 and ROCK2 on the invasive
properties of cells transfected with RAC1 and ROCK2 knockdowns
and control shRNAs was assessed by seeding cells onto matrigel
basement membrane on polycarbonate membranes. A signiﬁcant
reduction in the invasive potential of cell lines transfected with both
RAC1 and ROCK2 knockdown shRNA was observed by compar-
ison with the scrambled control (P = 0.05 for both) (Fig. 3d and
e) This analysis was not performed for PTK2 and LIMK1. RAC1
and ROCK2 knockdowns elicited a similar reduction in invasive
potential; an approximately 45% reduction in cell invasion was ob-
served with both RAC1 and ROCK2 80% knockdown clones as com-
pared with the scrambled control-transfected cell line. Similarly, a
25% reduction in invasion was seen in both genes carrying 50%
knockdown clones. All experiments were repeated and the results
were comparable in all three cell lines (ST8814, 507.1, and T529)
tested. In summary, both RAC1 and ROCK2 knockdown resulted in
a reduction in wound healing, cell migration, and invasiveness and
an increase in cell adhesion.

Validation of speciﬁc gene knockdown using shRNA clones was
completed by western blot analysis followed by densitometry using
Image J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) (Fig. 3f).

Discussion

Neuroﬁbromin, the NF1 gene product, is a tumor suppressor
protein whose main function is to downregulate Ras activity in the
cell. The mutational inactivation of the NF1 gene, leading to loss
of functional neuroﬁbromin, therefore, results in the constitutive
activation of cellular Ras, as well as the associated RAS/RAF/MAPK
signaling pathway, leading to increased cell growth and prolifera-
tion and an increased likelihood of tumorigenesis [Guha et al., 2006;
Upadhyaya, 2010]. The majority of the somatic NF1 mutations iden-
tiﬁable in both benign and malignant NF1-associated tumors serve
to inactivate the normal NF1 allele [Knudson, 1971]. However, the
presence of biallelic NF1 inactivation in both benign and malignant
tumors indicates that constitutive Ras activation cannot fully ex-
plain the malignant transformation of a benign PNF to an MPNST
and that additional genetic (or epigenetic) alterations are required to

(A) Wound healing assay on MPNST cell line ST8814. Cells were seeded on laminin, syncronized in 1% FBS for 24 hr and wounded
with a pipette tip. Wounds were followed up for 24 hr. Reduction in the rate of wound healing can be seen in the cell lines carrying RAC1and
ROCK2knockdowns. Cells were imaged on a microscope at ×10 magniﬁcation (Leica). (B) Adhesion assay on MPNST cell line ST8814. (i) ST8814
cells transfected with RAC1shRNA seeded on laminin, (ii) ROCK2shRNA-transfected cells seeded on laminin, (iii) cells transfected with RAC1
shRNA on ﬁbronectin, and (iv) ROCK2shRNA-transfected ST8814 cells seeded on ﬁbronectin. Adhesion was signiﬁcantly increased in samples
containing RAC1and ROCK2knockdowns in comparison with a cell line transfected with the scrambled control shRNA (P= 0.02) and (P= 0.05),
respectively. The RAC1knockdown results in more cell adhesion than the ROCK2knockdown but this difference was not signiﬁcant (P= 0.07).
Adhesion on ﬁbronectin was more efﬁcient than that on laminin in cell lines carrying both RAC1and ROCK2knockdown, but again this observed
difference was not signiﬁcant (P= 0.2). All results were a readout of the absorbance of crystal violet (5 mg/ml) eluted with 1% SDS at 550 nm on a
Genova MK3 Lifescience Analyser (Jenway). (C) Migration assay on ST8814 cell lines. (i) Migration of ST8814 cells transfected with RAC1shRNA,
(ii) migration of ST8814 cells transfected with ROCK2shRNA. Migration of ST8814 cells was signiﬁcantly reduced in cell lines carrying Rac1and
ROCK2knockdowns in comparison with ST8814 cells transfected with a scrambled vector (P= 0.05 and P= 0.03, respectively). The reduction in
migration was similar in cells transfected with both RAC1and ROCK2. 1.34× 10 fewer cells migrated through the membrane in the cell line with
the RAC180% knockdown and 1.3× 106 fewer cells migrated in the ROCK280% knockdown cell line as compared with the scrambled control.
All results were a readout of the absorbance of crystal violet (5 mg/ml) eluted with 1% SDS at 550 nm on a Genova MK3 Lifescience Analyser
(Jenway). (D) Invasion assay on ST8814 cell lines. (i) Invasion of ST8814 cells transfected with RAC1shRNA. (ii) Invasion of ST8814 cells transfected
with ROCK2shRNA. The invasion activity of ST8814 cell lines was signiﬁcantly reduced in those cell lines with both RAC1and ROCK2knockdown
as compared with the scrambled control (P= 0.05 for both). RAC1and ROCK2knockdowns elicited similar reductions in invasive potential of the
ST8814 cells. 1.85 × 106 fewer cells invaded the matrigel and membrane in the cell line with the RAC1 80% knockdown and 1.8× 106 in the ROCK2
80% knockdown as compared with the control scrambled cell line. All results were a readout of the absorbance of crystal violet (5 mg/ml) eluted
with 1% SDS at 550 nm on a Genova MK3 Lifescience Analyser (Jenway). (E) Invasion assay on ST8814 cells transfected with RAC1, ROCK2, and
scrambled control shRNA. Cells were stained with crystal violet (5 mg/ml) and images were taken at ×10 magniﬁcation (Leica). RAC1and ROCK2
knockdown elicited a reduction in the invasive potential of ST8814 cell lines as evidenced by the lack of RAC1and ROCK2shRNA-transfected cells
on the underside of the membrane following 3 days incubation. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Results were similar
for all three MPNST cell lines studied (ST8814, 507.1, and T529). All statistical analysis was completed with SPSS v16 using independent samples
t-test. (F) Western blot assay of cell lines transacted with 5 RAC1and ROCK2shRNA clones in addition to one cell line transfected with a scrambled

drive such transformation. In order to better understand the basis
of tumorigenesis in NF1, the detailed characterization of all ma-
lignant tumor-associated genetic/genomic defects will be required.
However, the somatic inactivation of cancer-associated genes may
involve many different mutational mechanisms, from point muta-
tions to large genomic rearrangements and even epigenetic changes
[Bignell et al., 2010; Stratton et al., 2009; Kops et al., 2005; Ra-
jagopalan et al., 2004. In NF1 tumors, somatic microlesions as well
as LOH and CNAs are likely to play a key role in malignant trans-
formation (reviewed by Upadhyaya, 2011)].

Both LOH analysis and/or direct somatic mutation screening at
the NF1 locus have been reported for many NF1-associated tu-
mors (both benign and malignant), including cutaneous and PNFs,
MPNSTs, pheochromocytomas, myeloid leukemias, gastrointestinal
tumors, glomus tumors, and bone tumors [Serra et al., 2000; Upad-
hyaya et al., 2004, Garcia-Linares et al., 2011; Bausch et al., 2007;
Side et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2007, 2008; Maertens et al., 2006;
Brems et al., 2009b, Stevenson et al., 2006]. Such genetic analyses
770

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 33, No. 4, 763–776, 2012

of MPNSTs have clearly shown that biallelic NF1 gene inactivation
only occurs in the component Schwann cells or glial cells of these
NF1-related tumors. What is still puzzling, however, is why only
10–15% of PNFs undergo malignant transformation to MPNSTs
even though both cutaneous and PNFs have essentially the same
cellular constitution. Alterations of other regions of the genome
have also been detected in several NF1-related tumors including
MPNSTs; these are known to involve the TP53, CDKN2A, and RB1
genes [Brems et al., 2009a; Cichowski and Jacks, 2001]. In contrast
to the speciﬁc chromosomal translocations found in many synovial
(and other types of) sarcoma, no consistently speciﬁc pathogenic
chromosomal aberrations are known to be associated with MP-
NSTs, although a number of small recurring chromosomal alter-
ations have been reported. Indeed, several cytogenetic studies have
noted that MPNSTs possess complex karyotypes characterized by
a wide spectrum of chromosomal aberrations including transloca-
tions and duplications as well as numerical gains and losses [Bridge
et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2009]. Frequent deletions of the 9p21 region

containing the CDKN2A (p16) gene have been reported in sev-
eral NF1–MPNSTs [Cairns et al., 1995; Frahm et al., 2004; Nielsen
et al., 1999; Perrone et al., 2003; Sabah et al., 2006]. At least two
other regions on chromosome 17, in addition to that containing
the NF1 gene at 17q11.2, appear to be involved in NF1 tumorigene-
sis, with gains at 17q21-q22 potentially accounting for the reported
upregulation of the TOP2A gene from this chromosomal region in
patients harboring MPNSTs and who have a poor disease outcome
[Skotheim et al., 2003]. Loss of the 17p13 region, encompassing the
TP53 gene, has been noted not only in NF1–MPNSTs [Legius et al.,
1994; Lothe et al., 2001] but also in soft sarcomas and other cancers
[Borr´as et al., 2011; Latres et al., 1994]. In similar vein, aberrant
expression of proteins of the Rb pathway has been associated with
soft-tissue sarcomas including MPNSTs [Mawrin et al, 2002].

The identiﬁcation of tumor-speciﬁc genomic copy number
changes in a range of different cancers [Weir et al., 2004; Suzuki et al.,
2008; Chen and Chen, 2008; Dear, 2009; Kuiper et al., 2010; Park
et al., 2010; Barretina et al., 2010] has led to the increased use of SNP
and CNV/CNA microarray platforms to screen tumor DNAs. Previ-
ous studies aimed at identifying the global genetic changes present
in benign and malignant NF1 tumors have variously applied gene
expression proﬁling and RT-PCR analysis to RNA from both benign
and malignant tumors in order to identify speciﬁc gene expression
signatures associated with malignancy. Signiﬁcant alterations in the
expression of many genes have been reported in MPNSTs, includ-
ing the TP53, RB1, CDKN2A (p16INK4A and p14/ARF), CDKN1B
(p27/KIP1), TWIST1, SOX9, SOX10, TNC, TRIO, NKD2, IRX2,
tenascin C and tenascin XB, and EGFR loci [L´evy et al., 2004; Miller
et al., 2006, 2009; L´evy et al., 2007 reviewed by Upadhyaya, 2011].
Although CNAs have been reported in many primary tumors, few
such studies of NF1 tumors have so far been undertaken. Initially, we
constructed an exon-based cancer gene microarray that speciﬁcally
targeted 57 different genes whose expression had previously been re-
ported to be signiﬁcantly altered in MPNSTs [Mantripragada et al.,
2008]. Subsequently, a 32K BAC array was used to analyze DNA
from both benign neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs, thereby providing a
genome-wide analysis of large [up to 150 kb] copy number changes
potentially associated with progression to malignancy [Mantripra-
gada et al., 2009] with an average resolution of 100 kb. However,
the relatively low resolution of this array platform meant that many
smaller (≤100 kb) genomic variants were unlikely to be identiﬁed,
leading us here to repeat such a genome-wide analysis using the
newly available Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP 6.0 platform, which
permits the simultaneous high-resolution analysis of both CNA and
LOH.

In a number of such microarray CNA studies, signiﬁcant variabil-
ity using different array platforms has been obtained when similar
tumor types are analyzed [Dear, 2009]. Whether such variability
arises from the different microarray platforms (BAC, PAC, SNPs,
and oligonucleotides) used, or from the variable size, number, and
genomic distribution of the probes in the microarray, or whether
it relates to the inherent genetic heterogeneity of the tumors them-
selves, is often difﬁcult to determine. We have found, however, that
the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform provides both increased resolution
(with an average interprobe distance of only 700 bp) and signiﬁ-
cantly greater genome-wide coverage (with 0.9× 106 SNP probes
and 0.95× 106 CNV probes) by comparison with the older 32K
BAC array [Kresse et al., 2008; Mantripragada et al., 2008, 2009].

A total of at least 17 different studies have now attempted to as-
sess the chromosomal and genomic copy number changes associated
with NF1-related tumors (see Table 4). Taken together, these studies
indicate that genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell growth, cell
differentiation, and motility are speciﬁcally altered in terms of their

copy number in MPNSTs. The present study has not only served
to conﬁrm these initial ﬁndings but also, courtesy of its higher
resolution, identiﬁed additional genes that appear to be involved in
MPNST development. For example, across chromosome 17, we ﬁnd
that several regions exhibit recurring copy number changes in MP-
NSTs; apart from the obvious 17q11.2 region containing the NF1
gene, two quite distinct regions at 17q22 and 17q24-q25 were also
found to be frequently ampliﬁed in MPNSTs, whereas one region at
17p13 was consistently deleted in MPNSTs. The 17q24-25 region,
which contains the BIRC5 gene, a gene previously reported to be
ampliﬁed in MPNSTs [Storlazzi et al., 2006] and consistently up-
regulated in many other tumors [Kanwar et al., 2010], was found to
be ampliﬁed in four MPNSTs. Survivin, the BIRC5 gene product, is
a central inhibitory protein of apoptosis that also regulates mitosis.
The 17q22 region, ampliﬁed in two MPNSTs in our study, contains
the TOP2A gene known to play a role in cell proliferation [Skotheim
et al., 2003]. The 17p13 region, which contains the TP53 gene, was
found to be deleted in four MPNSTs but not in any of the benign
tumors. Our CNA study also identiﬁed consistent ampliﬁcation of
the entire 5p region, reminiscent of ﬁndings from a previous CNA
analysis of soft-tissue sarcomas [Adamowicz et al., 2006]. This latter
study, which also analyzed 10 NF1-associated MPNSTs, found that
most of the 5p13-p15.3 region was ampliﬁed in several different
MPNSTs. Several of the 5p13-p15.3 region genes, including TRIO,
IRX2, and NKD2, were also found to exhibit increased expression
speciﬁcally in MPNSTs [Adamowicz et al., 2006]. TRIO is a mem-
ber of the large family of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors that
activate Rho–GTPases, speciﬁcally the RAC1 and RhoA Rho family
GTPases, by accelerating GDP/GTP exchanges. TRIO has been im-
plicated in the control of cytoskeleton organization, transcriptional
regulation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, vesicle trafﬁcking, and
cell–cell adhesion, whereas signiﬁcant TRIO gene ampliﬁcation has
been previously associated with both rapid tumor cell proliferation
and increased invasive tumor growth in bladder cancer [Zheng et al.,
2004].

Our earlier study found that the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
gene, the cellular HGF receptor (MET) gene, and the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) gene were concomitantly
ampliﬁed (despite their being located on different chromosomes) in
a number of MPNSTs but not in PNFs or cutaneous neuroﬁbromas
[Mantripragada et al., 2008]. The HGF–PDGFRA–p70S6K path-
way is known to play an essential role in tumor angiogenesis, and
rapamycin treatment could therefore be considered as a means to
limit tumor growth by inhibiting p70S6K. In the present study, MET
displayed a copy number of 2.8–3.0 in M3, M5, and MX, whereas
PDGFRA displayed a copy number of 3–4 in MX (but only 1.2–1.5
in M3 and M7).

Our previous 32K BAC array-based analysis [Mantripragada et al.,
2009] of MPNST DNA revealed that genomic gains (62%) were
much more frequent than genomic losses (38%) in these malignant
tumors. A number of genes were also consistently ampliﬁed in MPN-
STs; indeed, the NEDL1, AP3B1, and CUL1 genes located at 7q, 5q14,
and 7q36 were ampliﬁed in some 60% of tumors [Mantripragada
et al., 2009]. The most frequently deleted region, at 9p21, which en-
compasses the CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP genes, was, however,
only deleted in some 30% of tumors. Several of the abovementioned
six genes have also been implicated in a number of other cancers
[Goh et al., 2011; Mizuarai et al., 2011] and they may, therefore,
prove to have potential diagnostic, prognostic, and even therapeutic
relevance in the context of NF1 tumorigenesis.

The results of the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 analysis described here
extended our previous ﬁndings [reviewed by Upadhyaya, 2011]
based on different sets of benign and malignant tumors with

recurrent MPNST-speciﬁc ampliﬁed CNAs being found at 1q24,
1q34, 17q23.2, and 8p23. These copy number changes have al-
ready been noted to affect a variety of different genes including
ITGB4, BIRC5, MET, ETV4, TWIST1, TRIO, NKD2, IRX1, IRX2,
IRX4, EGFR, SOX9, HOXB5-9, TOP2A, MMP13, TP53, CDKN2A,
RB1, TNC, HMM, CDK4, and FOXM1 (Table 4). The use of the
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array in this study led to the identiﬁcation of
several additional genes that were consistently ampliﬁed in MPN-
STs, including the ITGB8, PDGFA, and RAC1 genes (all at 7p21.1-
p22) and the PDGFRL gene (8p22-p21.3), and the MMP12 gene
(11q22.3), which was deleted in MPNSTs.

The ampliﬁcation in MPNSTs of two related integrin genes,
ITGB4 at 17q25 and ITGB8 at 7p21.1-p22, is intriguing because
integrin signaling regulates the metastatic cancer phenotype [Guo,
2004], mainly through synergistic interactions with several criti-
cal signaling pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, the
Rho-effector pathway, and the epidermal growth factor receptor
pathway [Schubbert et al., 2004]. The RAC1 gene is a member of
the Rac subfamily of the large family of Rho–GTPases directly in-
volved in cell signaling and the regulation of cell growth, cell–cell
772

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 33, No. 4, 763–776, 2012

adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and the activation of protein
kinases. RAC1 protein interacts with the T-cell lymphoma invasion
and metastasis-inducing protein 1 and both are upregulated in na-
sopharyngeal carcinoma [Gao et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2007; Qi et al.,
2009; Worthylake et al., 2000]. The MMP12 gene is one of several
MMP genes located at 11q22.3. As with most other MMP proteins,
activated MMP12 degrades soluble and insoluble elastin, and is di-
rectly involved in extracellular matrix protein degradation [Shapiro,
1998, 1999]. MMP12 has been reported to be involved in glioma cell
invasion in the brain, apparently through its direct interactions with
tenascin C [Erickson and Bourdon, 1989]. Changes in MMP12 gene
expression might therefore be expected to accompany increased in-
vasiveness of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. As the PDGF
signaling system is upregulated in many cancers, the ﬁnding of
coampliﬁcation of the PDGFA and PDGFRL genes in four MPNSTs
in the present study may well be functionally signiﬁcant. A previous
investigation of the PDGF pathway in MPNSTs also noted increased
expression of PDGFRA and PDGFRB, as well as the EGFR gene
where increased gene expression and protein phosphorylation was
found to correlate with gains in EGFR copy number [Perrone et al.,

2007]. A more recent study also reported increased EGFR expres-
sion and PDGFRA ampliﬁcation in MPNSTs and noted that both
features were associated with a poor prognosis [Tabone-Eglinger
et al., 2008]. Once activated, EGFR and PDGFR stimulate tyrosine
kinase activity and intracellular pathways that control proliferation
and differentiation.

The present study identiﬁed a much larger number of deleted
genomic regions in MPNSTs than the two previous studies [Kresse
et al., 2008; Mantripragada et al., 2009]. However, we failed to iden-
tify any relationship between the grade of MPNSTs (Supp. Table S1)
and the CNA proﬁle. Furthermore, the copy number proﬁles gen-
erated from the individual MPNSTs appear to identify two distinct
subgroups of malignant tumors: those with a major CNA proﬁle (tu-
mors M2, M3, M6, M7, M8, and M15) and those with a minor CNA
proﬁle (tumors M4, M10, M11, M12, and M13) comparable with
the copy number proﬁles obtained from benign PNFs. It is perhaps
difﬁcult to reconcile these data pertaining to inter-MPNST hetero-
geneity, especially as several of the MPNSTs in both subgroups were
classiﬁed as high-grade tumors. Similarly, the ﬁnding of a high-CNA
proﬁle associated with a benign PNF (P116) derived from a sporadic
NF1 patient is puzzling, although one explanation could be that this
PNF was in transition toward MPNST development. This disparity
in CNA proﬁles between apparently high-grade MPNSTs may also
be a consequence of the considerable somatic genetic heterogeneity
associated with these malignant tumors [reviewed by Upadhyaya,
2011] and further highlights the signiﬁcant diagnostic and therapeu-
tic challenges posed by these histologically complex and genetically
highly heterogeneous tumors [Stasik & Tawﬁk, 2006; Spurlock et al.,
2010].

Loss-of-heterozygosity and CNAs are only two of the many
genetic mechanisms potentially involved in NF1 tumorigenesis.
Hence, MPNSTs lacking a signiﬁcant number of CNAs may har-
bor microlesions and/or aberrant methylation of gene promoter
regions. However, the signiﬁcant degree of LOH found in most MP-
NSTs, LOH that is essentially absent from benign neuroﬁbromas,
conﬁrms our previous ﬁnding that many NF1-associated MPN-
STs harbor large somatic NF1 deletions [Upadhyaya et al., 2008;
Botillo et al., 2009]. Furthermore, CNN–LOH analysis indicated
that CNN–LOH is less common than LOH (allelic imbalance) in
the development of MPNSTs and this concurs with our earlier ﬁnd-
ing.

This study is the ﬁrst to assess both LOH and CNA within the
same panel of MPNST and PNF tumors. This approach has yielded
new insights into the biological pathways involved in the malignant
transformation of PNFs in NF1. This study has also identiﬁed a
number of candidate genes that may be involved in MPNST devel-
opment. Further studies of these genes should now be performed
with a larger set of tumor samples, both to conﬁrm the copy number
changes and to seek additional types of tumor-associated mutation
within these genes.

It is unclear what would be the net effect of the observed CNAs on
cellular properties and how this would impact upon tumorigenesis.
A better understanding of how such CNAs inﬂuence the expression
of the genes they encompass is required in order to assess their pos-
sible role in tumorigenesis. Such studies are ongoing, one of which
directly assessed the impact that SNPs and CNVs have on gene ex-
pression, ﬁnding that less than 20% of gene expression variability
was directly attributable to CNVs of ≥40 kb in size [Henrichsen
et al., 2009a, 2009b]. In addition, at least half of the genes whose
expression was directly inﬂuenced by a CNV were actually located
outside the relevant CNV [Henrichsen et al., 2009a, 2009b], an in-
dication that many CNVs affect gene regulatory sequences located
at some distance from the target gene. A genetic pathway represents

a set of interactions occurring within and between a group of genes
that are dependent upon each other’s individual functions in order
to make the aggregate function of the network available to the cell.
Gene pathways are composed of multiple genes with coordinated
functions. Thus, a genetic mutation disrupting the function of one
gene in a pathway necessarily breaks the informational connection
between genes acting before and after the mutant gene in that path-
way. Several new insights into pathways potentially involved in NF1
tumorigenesis were obtained during the course of this study.

The principal requirements for cancer metastasis to occur include
tumor cell adhesion, migration, cell invasion, and wound healing.
The present study identiﬁed CNAs affecting several genes from the
Ras-homologous (Rho)–GTPase signaling pathway (ACTB, ACTG1,
LIMK1, PRKCA, PTK2, RAC1, ROCK2, and TRIO) speciﬁcally in
MPNSTs. The potential involvement of this signaling pathway in tu-
mor development is likely to be important because Rho–GTPases are
key regulators of actin reorganization, cell motility, cell–cell and cell–
extracellular matrix adhesion, cell cycle progression, gene expres-
sion, and apoptosis [Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002], processes
that are involved in both malignant transformation and metastasis.
Many of the copy number gains observed in our study may therefore
be directly implicated in the malignant transformation from benign
PNF to malignant MPNST through the promotion of cell prolifer-
ation, motility, and metastasis and by the speciﬁc alteration of the
cellular pathways that serve to reorganize the cytoskeletal structures.
Functional analysis of MPNST cell lines transfected with shRNAs for
RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 indicated that targeted knock-
down of at least four of the genes that map to the Rho–GTPase
pathway reduces the malignant potential of these cells as evidenced
by a signiﬁcant reduction in wound healing, invasion, and migra-
tion and an increase in cell adhesion. On this basis, we propose that
it would be worth exploring whether the use of speciﬁc inhibitors
of individual Rho functions could be used to provide therapeutic
beneﬁt in patients with MPNSTs [Fritz & Kaina, 2006]. The use of
such an inhibitor in a prostate carcinoma cell line has been shown
to inhibit the proliferation, anchorage-dependent growth, and in-
vasiveness of these tumor cells [Gao et al., 2004].

The use of DNA copy number data to explore the process of ma-
lignant transformation, as well as to subclassify different tumors,
does however have several limitations, the most obvious being that
many such tumor-speciﬁc CNAs involve multiple genes, many of
which are unlikely to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis.
Hence, the identiﬁcation of diagnostically and prognostically appli-
cable genetic markers in tumors is always going to be challenging.
Indeed, this is clearly demonstrated in the present study, which re-
vealed that no single gene, or even multiple gene set, was consistently
altered in all MPNSTs as compared with PNFs. Other mutational
mechanisms will therefore need to be considered in NF1-assocated
tumorigenesis, for example, microlesions, increased microsatellite
instability, and even epigenetic changes that may inﬂuence gene ex-
pression either speciﬁcally or globally. A major problem with many
of the high-resolution analytical technologies recently applied to the
study of human tumor genomes is the plethora of somatic mutation
data they create. This mass of data then requires careful dissection
to identify the very few “driver” mutations from among the many
accompanying “passenger” mutations [Stratton et al., 2009]. Unfor-
tunately, this is especially problematic in tumors such as MPNSTs,
which exhibit both complex chromosomal abnormalities and signif-
icant cellular heterogeneity. A comprehensive study of a large panel
of both NF-associated and sporadic MPNSTs, and that integrates
copy number change measurements, gene expression analysis, and
biologically relevant functional analyses, is clearly warranted. Such
studies should follow the example of the comprehensive integrated
773

genomic analyses that the Cancer Genome Atlas programme have
applied to deﬁne a range of cancer genomes [Ding et al., 2008; Par-
sons et al., 2008]. It is intriguing that these and other similar studies
consistently identify the presence of inactivating NF1 gene muta-
tions in many of these tumors including ovarian serous carcinomas
[Sangha et al., 2008; Kuo et al., 2009], acute myelogenous leukemia
[Mullally and Ebert, 2010], neuroblastoma [H¨olzel et al., 2010], lung
cancer [Bignell et al., 2010, Ding et al., 2008; Kan et al., 2010], as well
as in various other cancers [Kan et al., 2010]. These studies serve to
highlight the central role that neuroﬁbromin plays in the function
of normal cells and supports the view that the loss of this function is
a major cause of tumorigenesis. As somatic gene ampliﬁcation, par-
alleled by increased gene expression, is a hallmark of many cancers,
the generation of comprehensive maps of copy number variation
[Bergamaschi et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008] and their associated gene
expression changes should contribute to a better understanding
of the mechanisms through which CNAs promote tumorigenesis.
Current challenges involve developing high-resolution methods for
determining the association of CNAs with biological function in
common cancer.

In summary, we have identiﬁed speciﬁc genomic changes in MP-
NSTs as reﬂected by CNV, LOH, and CNN–LOH analyses. Some
1,521 genes were found to be associated with the speciﬁc CNAs
in MPNSTs, several of which represent excellent candidates for
involvement in tumorigenesis, including novel changes involving
ITGB8, PDGFA and RAC1 (all 7p21-p22), PDGFRL (8p22-p21.3),
and MMP12 (11q22.3). We also report that allelic imbalance in NF1-
associated MPNSTs is more prevalent than CNN–LOH, consistent
with the view that imbalances of expression are critically impor-
tant in tumorigenesis. Our other key ﬁnding was the involvement
of several genes of the Rho–GTPase pathway, which could prove to
have a pivotal role in the regulation of processes involved in NF1
tumorigenesis and metastasis. shRNA for RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and
LIMK1 were used in adhesion, migration, and wound healing assays
and also RAC1 and ROCK2 in cell invasion in control and MPNST-
derived cell lines. The results of these assays clearly demonstrated
that targeted knockdown of such genes is capable of reducing the
malignant potential of these cells. Taken together, we have identiﬁed
several new potential targets for therapeutic intervention during
MPNST development.
