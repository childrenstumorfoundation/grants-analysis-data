Abstract

Aberrant activity of the receptor tyrosine kinases MET, AXL, and FGFR1/2/3 has been associated with
tumor progression in a wide variety of human malignancies, notably in instances of primary or acquired
resistance to existing or emerging anticancer therapies. This study describes the preclinical characterization of
S49076, a novel, potent inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3. S49076 potently blocked cellular
phosphorylation of MET, AXL, and FGFRs and inhibited downstream signaling in vitro and in vivo. In cell
models, S49076 inhibited the proliferation of MET- and FGFR2-dependent gastric cancer cells, blocked MET-
driven migration of lung carcinoma cells, and inhibited colony formation of hepatocarcinoma cells expressing
FGFR1/2 and AXL. In tumor xenograft models, a good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for
MET and FGFR2 inhibition following oral administration of S49076 was established and correlated well with
impact on tumor growth. MET, AXL, and the FGFRs have all been implicated in resistance to VEGF/VEGFR
inhibitors such as bevacizumab. Accordingly, combination of S49076 with bevacizumab in colon carcinoma
xenograft models led to near total inhibition of tumor growth. Moreover, S49076 alone caused tumor growth
arrest in bevacizumab-resistant tumors. On the basis of these preclinical studies showing a favorable and novel
pharmacologic proﬁle of S49076, a phase I study is currently underway in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Introduction

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) bind extracellular
ligands to elicit cascades of recruitment and phosphory-
lation of downstream signaling proteins. Aberrant activ-
ity of certain RTKs has been associated with tumor pro-
gression in a wide variety of human malignancies, making
them promising drug targets for cancer therapy (1).

MET is the RTK for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).
HGF binding induces recruitment of the adaptor protein
GAB1 and activation of multiple signaling networks

including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-
mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways (2). Collec-
tively, these signals lead to promotion of cell survival,
proliferation, migration,
invasion and angiogenesis.
Deregulation of MET signaling due to overexpression of
MET or HGF has been associated with poor prognosis in a
wide variety of human malignancies. Activating muta-
tions in MET have been identiﬁed in some tumors, directly
implicating MET in tumorigenesis (3).

AXL is a member of the TAM family of RTKs, which
also includes MER and TYRO-3. Interaction with growth
arrest-speciﬁc gene 6 (GAS6) activates the PI3K-AKT-
mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways to promote
proliferation, survival, and migration of cancer cells
in vitro (4) and tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo
(5). AXL and MER also regulate tumor–stromal cell inter-
actions via secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines (6).
No activating mutations in AXL have been described,
making overexpression of AXL and/or GAS6 the primary
mechanisms of activation in a wide range of human
cancers in which expression levels often correlate with
poor prognosis (6).

The ﬁbroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) signal

regulate cellular proliferation, survival, migration, and
differentiation. FGFR signaling is not only important for
tumor angiogenesis but is also directly implicated in the
pathogenesis of a large range of tumor types. Activation of
FGFRs is due to abnormal expression levels of the FGFRs
or their ligands, mutations, and ampliﬁcations (7).

Recently, two important concepts concerning the impli-
cation of MET, AXL/MER, the FGFRs, and other RTKs in
cancer pathology have emerged. First, not only do these
receptors directly or indirectly interact at the cell surface,
but also downstream signaling networks may coordinate-
ly promote tumor progression. For example, in basal-like
breast cancers, MET was shown to interact with, and
promote signal transduction downstream of, AXL (8).
Increased expression and coactivation of MET and AXL
has been described in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
ref. 9) and in mesothelioma (10). MET, the FGFRs, and
their respective ligands have been shown to be coex-
pressed and to synergize in endometrial cancer (11),
multiple myeloma (12), and acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML; ref. 13). In both NSCLC (14, 15) and gastric cancer
(16), functional crosstalk exists between MET or AXL with
the HER family members, EGFR and HER3.

Second, studies in recent years have clearly shown a
major role of MET, AXL, and FGFRs in primary or
acquired resistance to diverse anticancer therapies. For
example, ampliﬁcation of the MET gene is seen in up to
20% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumors with acquired resis-
tance to EGFR inhibitors (17). Increased MET expression
may also confer resistance to EGFR inhibition in colorectal
cancer (18). In glioblastomas, MET is proposed to play a
key role in resistance to EGFR inhibition (19), VEGF
antagonism (20), chemotherapy (21), and radiotherapy
(22, 23). Other cancers where aberrant activation of MET
may play a role in resistance include bortezomib-resistant
multiple myeloma (24), androgen-ablation resistant pros-
tate cancer (25) and chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma
(26), and pancreatic cancer (27). AXL overexpression
and/or activation have been implicated in resistance to
cisplatin in ovarian cancer (28) and resistance to imatinib
in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in gastrointestinal
tumors (29, 30). Cancers where the FGFRs and their
ligands have been implicated in resistance mechanisms
include resistance to tamoxifen and HER2 inhibitors in
breast cancer (31, 32) and to MET inhibition in gastric
carcinoma (33).

Importantly, a growing number of cancers are being
identiﬁed in which all of MET, AXL, and FGFRs have been
shown to play a role in resistance mechanisms–either
independently or in unison. In the case of EGFR inhibi-
tor–resistant NSCLC, apart from the MET ampliﬁcation
cited above, a recent study also shows a role of AXL in the
resistance of approximately 20% of tumors (34). Activa-
tion of FGFR2 and FGFR3 has also been documented in
NSCLC cell lines treated with EGFR inhibitors (35). MET,
AXL, and FGFRs have all been implicated in the resistance
of BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma to BRAF inhibitors
(36–38) and in chemotherapy-resistant AML (13, 39). Both

MET and AXL have been shown to play a role in HER2-
positive breast cancer resistant to lapatinib (40, 41) and, in
preclinical models, resistance to AKT inhibition (42).
Finally, MET, AXL/MER, and FGFRs are important in
angiogenesis (3, 5, 7) and as such may confer primary or
acquired resistance to inhibitors of VEGF receptor
(VEGFR).

Herein, we describe the pharmacologic properties of
S49076, a novel, potent ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase
inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3 currently
in phase I clinical trials. S49076 inhibits autophosphoryla-
tion of these RTKs and their downstream signaling in vitro
and in vivo, blocks growth and migration of MET-, AXL-
and FGFR-overexpressing cells in culture, and shows
marked antitumor activity in MET- and FGFR-dependent
tumor xenografts at well-tolerated doses.

Materials and Methods
In vitro kinase binding and activity assays

The binding mode of S49076 in the ATP pocket of MET
was inferred from X-ray resolution of cocrystal complexes
of analogs of S49076 with a C-terminal portion of MET
(aa1038-1346; NM_000245.2). The kinetics of interaction of
S49076 with MET were studied using real-time label-free
interaction analysis. A C-terminal fragment of MET
(aa956-1390; NM_000245.2) was captured by its His6 tag

on a NTA chip (Biacore) at pH 7.4 at 25
C in 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% P20, 50 mmol/L EDTA,
and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). GluR2 was used
as control protein on the reference ﬂow cell. A typical
analysis cycle consisted of 200 seconds of MET capture
(5 mL/min), followed by 90 seconds sample injection
(30 mL/min), 600 seconds of buffer ﬂow (dissociation
phase), and then 180 seconds EDTA 350 mmol/L injection
to regenerate the ﬂow cell. The kinase-binding selectivity
of S49076 was determined on the KINOMEscan panel of
442 human wild-type and mutated kinases (DiscoveRx).
Radiometric biochemical assays for inhibition of AXL,
MER, and wild-type and mutated isoforms of MET and
FGF receptors were conducted at Millipore.

Protein extracts from cells and xenografts were pre-

pared at 4
C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay extrac-
tion buffer (150 mol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
1% triton X-100, 1 mol/L EGTA, and 1 mmol/L EDTA) to
which protease (1% v/v; 539134; Calbiochem) and phos-
phatase (1% v/v; 524625; Calbiochem) inhibitor cocktails
were added. Protein concentration was determined with
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).

To prepare protein extracts from S49076 and ninteda-
nib-treated cells, subconﬂuent cells were starved in
appropriate media containing 0.1% FCS for 24 hours
followed by 2 hours of treatment then direct cell lysis in
the culture vessels.
In siRNA experiments, siRNA
duplexes (30 nmol/L) were transfected at 48 hours before
cell lysis using 0.15% Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection
Reagent (Invitrogen) in complete culture medium. In all
experiments where exogenous growth factors were used,
cells were treated in the ﬁnal 10 to 20 minutes before lysis

80 ng/mL EGF, or 30 ng/mL VEGF.

Western blotting and ELISA

For immunoprecipitation of FGFR3, 700 mg of protein
extract in 700 mL lysis buffer was incubated with anti-
FGFR3 for 2 hours. Fifty microliters of protein A/G
agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the
mixture which was incubated on a rotating device for 1
hour. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 10,000
 g for 1 minute and washed four times with lysis buffer.
Extracts and immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted
into Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% v/v
b-mercaptoethanol, or NuPage LDS with reducing agent

(Invitrogen), heated for 5 minutes at 95
C, and resolved on
Tris-glycine gels or NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Novex; Invitro-
gen). Biotinylated molecular weight standards (Cell Sig-
naling Technology) were included in all gels. Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, ECL;
Amersham), which were blocked in PBS/0.1% Tween 20

(PBST) containing 5% milk, and probed at 4
C overnight
with primary antibodies. Antibodies directed against
phosphorylated epitopes were diluted in 5% bovine serum
albumin; all other antibodies were diluted in 5% milk.
Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted

into 5% milk and applied to membranes for 1 hour at 20
C.
Chemiluminescence detection was conducted using the
ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham) and
was recorded on ECL plus hyperﬁlm (Amersham). Blots
were scanned using the Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densi-
tometer and quantitative analysis of Western blots was
conducted using TotalLab software (Amersham).

Evaluation of P(Y1349)MET, P(Y1054)VEGFR2, P(S473)
AKT, P(T421/S424)p70S6K, and corresponding total pro-
teins was conducted according to Meso Scale Discovery
ELISA protocols using the Sector Imager 2400 plate read-
er. The phosphorylation of AXL was evaluated by ELISA
at Proqinase in extracts of murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts
(MEF) engineered to express a high level of full-length
human AXL. When required, IC50 values for inhibition of
phosphorylated proteins normalized to total proteins
were calculated from dose–response curves (XLﬁt).

Cell viability, migration, and colony formation assays
For GTL-16 and SNU-16 viability assays, cells were
seeded in 96-well microplates at the appropriate density
in media containing 10% FCS and supplemented 48 hours
later with serial dilutions of S49076 in a ﬁnal volume of 150
mL per well. After 96 hours (GTL-16) or 120 hours (SNU-
16) incubation (corresponding to 4 doubling times), 15 mL
of a solution of 5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma) was added to each

well and the plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37
C. The
formazan metabolite was solubilized in SDS for SNU-16
and, following removal of the MTT solution, in DMSO for
GTL-16. Global cell viability was estimated by measure-
ment of optical density at 540 nm. Viability assay using
MKN-7 cells was conducted at Oncotest (Germany) using
a modiﬁed propidium iodide (PI) assay. Brieﬂy, cells were

seeded in 96-well microplates at the appropriate density
in media containing 10% FCS and supplemented 24 hours
later with serial dilutions of S49076 in a ﬁnal volume
of 100 mL per well. After 96 hours, 200 mL of a solution
of 7 mg/mL PI was added to each well and the plates

were incubated for 2 hours at 20
C. Global cell viability
was estimated by measurement of ﬂuorescence on a
microplate reader (excitation l ¼ 530 nm, emission l ¼
620 nm).

Migration assays were conducted using A549 cells
seeded in 96-well microplates and incubated for 24 hours
to obtain conﬂuent cultures. One millimeter gaps were
introduced by scraping with a pipette tip and cultures
were incubated for a further 40 hours with 80 ng/mL HGF
and serial dilutions of S49076. The width of the gap was
measured using the BD Pathway high-content cell ana-
lyzer. Colony formation assays were conducted at Oncot-
est. Brieﬂy, 5–10  103 cells were seeded in agar in 24-well
dishes and cultured for 8 to 18 days in Iscove’s modiﬁed
Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 40 ng/mL HGF,
20% FCS, and serial dilutions of S49076. Twenty-four
hours before evaluation, vital colonies were stained with
2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium
chloride. Colonies were counted with an automatic image
analysis system (BIOREADER 5000 PRO-XI, Biosys
GmbH). Cell
lysates were provided by Oncotest for
Western blot analyses. IC50 values for inhibition of cell
viability, migration, or colony formation were calculated
from dose–response curves (XLﬁt).

Mouse studies

Female balb/c and swiss nu/nu mice (Charles River)
were used in accordance with institutional guidelines as
well as with national and European laws and regulations
as put forth by the French Forest and Agriculture Ministry
and the standards required by the United Kingdom Coor-
dinating Committee on Cancer Research (43). Mouse
weights were more than 18 g at the start of experiments.
Doses are expressed as milligrams of free base per kilo-
gram of body weight.

The hydrochloride salt of S49076 was administered
orally to mice in 1% (w/v) hydroxyethylcellulose in ammo-
nium acetate buffer pH 4.5 in a volume of 200 mL per 20 g
body weight. The maximal tolerated dose of S49076 in these
mice was determined to be 100 mg/kg/d (5 days a week
for at least 3 weeks). Bevacizumab was dissolved in PBS
and administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 200 mL
per 20 g body weight.

For pharmacodynamics studies, female nude balb/c
nu/nu mice were subcutaneously injected with 107
GTL-16 or 5  106 SNU-16 cells. When tumors reached
a size of approximately 150 mm3, mice were randomized
into homogeneous groups of 3 and given a single oral
administration of S49076 at doses of 0.78 to 50 mg/kg. At
2, 6, and 16 hours posttreatment, treated and control mice
were sacriﬁced, tumors were excised, and proteins were
extracted in tissue lysis buffer for analysis by Western blot
or ELISA. The tumor and blood concentrations of S49076

in tumor-bearing or healthy mice were determined by
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/
MS-MS) analysis of tumor lysates or in blood collected by
cardiac puncture into tubes containing EDTA as antico-
agulant. For efﬁcacy studies, female nude balb/c nu/nu
mice were injected subcutaneously with 107 GTL-16 cells,
5  106 SNU-16 cells or 106 U87-MG cells (the U87-MG
cells were ﬁrst suspended in reconstituted basement
membrane, Matrigel, BD Biosciences). When tumors
reached a size of approximately 150 mm3, mice were
randomized into homogeneous groups of 8 and treated
orally with S49076 at doses of 3.125 to 100 mg/kg once or
twice daily for 5 days a week for up to 4 weeks.

Studies of S49076 in association with bevacizumab were
carried out using swiss nu/nu mice injected subcutane-
ously with 107 HT-29 or LS-174T cells. In the HT-29 study,
when tumors reached a size of approximately 150 mm3,
mice were randomized into homogeneous groups of 10
and treated orally with S49076 (50 or 100 mg/kg) once
daily for 5 days a week for 3 weeks and/or intraperi-
toneally with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) twice weekly for 3
weeks. In the LS-174T study, when tumors reached a size
of approximately 100 mm3, mice were randomized, 12
mice were maintained untreated, and the remainder
were treated intraperitoneally with bevacizumab twice
weekly for 2 weeks. Two weeks later, bevacizumab-trea-
ted mice were further split into 3 groups of 10 mice and
treated or not with 50 mg/kg S49076 orally twice daily
5 days a week for 3 weeks or with 10 mg/kg beva-
cizumab intraperitoneally twice weekly for 3 weeks. In
all studies, antitumor efﬁcacy was monitored by at least
twice weekly measurement of tumor sizes using calipers
and body weights were recorded to document potential
general toxicity. Percentage tumor growth inhibition on
a given day was calculated using the formula: [1-RTV
(treated)/RTV(untreated)]  100, where RTV ¼ relative
tumor volume on the given day versus start of treatment.
Statistical analyses were conducted using two-way
ANOVA with repeated measures over time followed by
Dunnett test on log tumor volumes.

Body weight loss was less than 5% for all groups, all

time points, and in all experiments.

Results
S49076 is a potent inhibitor of wild-type and mutated
isoforms of MET, AXL, MER, and FGFR1/2/3

S49076 was discovered through medicinal chemistry
supported by structural biology and molecular modeling
to identify potent and selective MET inhibitors. The bind-
ing mode of S49076 in the ATP pocket of MET was inferred
from X-ray resolution of cocrystal complexes of analogs
of S49076 with the C-terminal portion of MET (Fig. 1).
Real-time label-free interaction analysis of S49076 with the
C-terminal portion of MET enabled determination of on-

IC50 values below 20 nmol/L. Importantly, S49076 also
inhibited the kinase activity of all tested clinically relevant
mutated isoforms of MET and FGFR1/2 at similar con-
centrations (Table 1). The kinase-binding selectivity of
S49076 was determined on a panel of 442 human wild-
type and mutated kinases. At 100 nmol/L, apart from the
primary targets MET, AXL/MER, and FGFRs, only 6% of
kinases were identiﬁed as hits. The kinase interaction map
for S49076 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.

S49076 selectively inhibits MET, AXL, and FGFR1/2/
3 signaling in cancer cells

The capacity of S49076 to inhibit MET, AXL, and
FGFR1/2/3 activation and signaling was evaluated in
cancer cells in which these RTKs were either constitutively
active or activated by addition of their respective ligand.
The autophosphorylation of MET at tyrosines Tyr1234/
1235 in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain was evaluated
by Western blot analysis in H441 NSCLC cells in which
MET is overexpressed and constitutively active. Total
inhibition of MET phosphorylation was seen after 2 hours
of incubation with 10 nmol/L S49076 and an IC50 of 2
nmol/L was calculated from densitometric analysis. Sig-
nal transduction downstream of MET is largely mediated
by the adaptor protein GAB1 which is phosphorylated by
MET on Tyr627 (3). Corresponding inhibition of GAB1
phosphorylation on this site by S49076 was also seen (Fig.
2A). The autophosphorylation of MET on tyrosine
Tyr1349 in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is critical
for recruitment and activation of signal transduction
molecules and adaptor proteins (3). S49076 inhibited MET
phosphorylation on this site in GTL-16 gastric carcinoma
cells with an IC50 value of 3 nmol/L and IC90 value of 10
nmol/L as evaluated by ELISA (Fig. 2B).

The inhibition of AXL phosphorylation by S49076 was
evaluated by ELISA in MEFs expressing human AXL. The
IC50 for AXL inhibition by S49076 was 56 nmol/L (Fig.
2C). Activation of AXL following binding to GAS6 leads to
signal transduction via the phosphorylation on Ser473 of
AKT (2). However, GAS6 also binds and activates the two
other receptors of the TAM family, MER and TYRO3. To
evaluate the speciﬁc inhibition of AXL signaling in cancer
cells by S49076, it was necessary to identify cells in which
the activation of AKT by GAS6 depended exclusively on
AXL. To this end, we used siRNA technology to knock
down AXL, MER, and TYRO3 separately or in combina-
tion with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells followed by
addition of GAS6 and evaluation of AKT phosphorylation

of MET and GAB1 phosphorylation in H441 cells. Western blots using antibodies to phosphorylated and total proteins from one representative experiment
are shown. Densitometric analysis of the blots indicated IC50s of 2 and 1 nmol/L for the inhibition of MET and GAB1 phosphorylation respectively. B, inhibition of
MET phosphorylation in GTL-16 cells. Levels of phosphorylated and total MET were evaluated by ELISA. Data are from four independent experiments in which
levels of phosphorylated MET were normalized to total protein. S49076 inhibited MET phosphorylation with an IC50 of 3 nmol/L and an IC90 of 10 nmol/L.
C, inhibition of AXL phosphorylation in murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts engineered to express human AXL. Level of phosphorylated AXL was evaluated
by ELISA. Data (mean  SD) are from duplicate wells. S49076 inhibited AXL phosphorylation with an IC50 of 56 nmol/L. D, inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. GAS6, HGF, or EGF were added at the indicated concentrations for the ﬁnal 10 to 20 minutes before lysis.

by Western blot analysis. In these cells, while AXL knock-
down completely ablated AKT phosphorylation follow-
ing GAS6 addition, knockdown of MER and/or TYRO3
had no effect (Supplementary Fig. S3). It was thus con-
sidered that AXL was the major driver of AKT phosphor-
ylation. In this model, S49076 inhibited AXL signaling
via AKT with an IC50 of 33 nmol/L (Fig. 2D). To further
show the selectivity of S49076 for MET and AXL signaling,
MDA-MB-231 cells treated with S49076 were stimulated
with HGF to activate MET, or EGF to activate EGFR. As
expected, AKT phosphorylation was inhibited in the
low nanomolar range in the presence of HGF, whereas
no inhibition was seen at up to 1 mmol/L in the presence
of EGF (Fig. 2D).

The inhibition of FGFR1/2/3 and their downstream
signaling was evaluated in cancer cells known to individ-
ually overexpress each of these receptors. The H1703
NSCLC cell line has high levels of FGFR1 (44) which was
activated by addition of FGF2. The SNU-16 gastric and
RT-112 bladder cancer cell lines overexpress constitutive-
ly active forms of FGFR2 and FGFR3, respectively (45, 46).
In these cells, S49076 inhibited the autophosphorylation
of the receptors on Tyr653/654 and the phosphorylation
of the FGFR-speciﬁc adaptor protein FRS2 on Tyr436.
Densitometric analyses allowed calculation of IC50 values
which were in all cases between 50 and 200 nmol/L.
Corresponding decreases in phosphorylation of the down-
stream signaling proteins ERK1/2 on Thr202/Tyr204 was
also seen (Fig. 2E–G).

Many multitarget kinase inhibitors currently in clinical
development potently inhibit VEGFR2. Although this
receptor is implicated in tumor angiogenesis, it also has
an important physiologic role in the maintenance of vas-
cular tone and its inhibition may dictate the maximum
tolerated dose for these molecules (47). VEGFR2 was not
among the kinases bound by S49076 in the kinase proﬁle.
However, to conﬁrm lack of potent inhibition of this
kinase in a cellular context, the intracellular autopho-
sphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr1054 was evaluated by
ELISA after incubation of HUVECs with S49076, followed
by stimulation with VEGF. The IC50 was 1.9 mmol/L for
S49076 and 0.5 nmol/L for nintedanib, a dual VEGFR-
FGFR inhibitor used as positive control (Fig. 2H).

S49076 inhibits viability, motility, and three-
dimensional colony formation of cancer cells
expressing MET, AXL, or FGFRs

GTL-16 cells are dependent on overexpressed, consti-
tutively active MET for proliferation (2), whereas the

S49076, a Novel MET, AXL, and FGFR Inhibitor

viability of SNU-16 cells depends on ampliﬁed, constitu-
tively active, FGFR2 (45). S49076 inhibited the viability of
each of these cell lines in monolayer culture with IC50
values of 3 and 167 nmol/L, respectively. In GTL-16 cells,
the IC90 for inhibition of viability was 5 nmol/L (Fig. 3A).
At this concentration, the inhibition of MET phosphory-
lation on Tyr1349 was 65% (Fig. 2B), suggesting that
partial inhibition of MET was sufﬁcient for near-maximal
effect on growth. A third human gastric carcinoma cell
line, MKN-7, reported to be dependent on EGFR activity
for survival and proliferation in monolayer culture (48),
was insensitive to S49076 at concentrations of up to 10
mmol/L, thus conﬁrming the target selectivity of S49076.
The ability of S49076 to inhibit MET-driven migration was
evaluated using the A549 human NSCLC cell line in
which migration was induced by addition of HGF.
S49076 potently inhibited migration in this model with an
IC50 of 14 nmol/L (Fig. 3B).

Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the princi-
pal roles of AXL may be in migration and metastasis
rather than in proliferation and survival of cells of the
primary tumor (5). One model which may reﬂect the
capacity of tumor cells to survive and grow independently
of anchorage to an extracellular matrix is the soft agar
colony formation assay. Screening of a large number of
cell lines by Western blot analysis enabled the identiﬁca-
tion of three hepatocarcinoma cell lines in which AXL was
highly expressed and activated (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
S49076 potently inhibited the three-dimensional growth
in soft agar of these cells, whereas no effect was seen on a
fourth hepatocarcinoma cell
line in which AXL was
expressed and activated at much lower levels (Fig. 3C).
All four cell lines did, however, also express both FGFR1
and FGFR2 and displayed phosphorylation of FRS2 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1), so it is possible that this effect on
clonogenic survival was partially due to inhibition of
FGFRs. Interestingly, none of these cell lines were sensi-
tive to S49076 in a monolayer culture, possibly conﬁrming
a major role of AXL in anchorage-independent growth.

S49076 inhibits MET and FGFR2 phosphorylation as
well as tumor growth in MET- and FGFR2-dependent
xenografts at doses predicted from cell assays and
pharmacokinetic studies

The capacity of S49076 to inhibit MET signaling was
evaluated in subcutaneous GTL-16 xenografts. Follow-
ing oral administration at subtoxic doses, S49076 inhib-
ited the phosphorylation of MET at Tyr1349 in a dose-
and time- dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Inhibition was

and corresponding inhibition of phosphorylation of FRS2 and ERK1/2. FGF2 was added for the ﬁnal 10 minutes before lysis in the case of the H1703
cells (E). Western blots using antibodies to phosphorylated and total proteins from one representative experiment in each case are shown. FGFR3 in
the RT-112 cells (G) was immunoprecipitated before Western blot analysis. Densitometric analysis of the blots indicated IC50s of 68, 95, and 200 nmol/L,
respectively, for the inhibition of the phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. H, S49076 does not potently inhibit VEGFR2 in HUVECs. VEGF
was added for the ﬁnal 10 minutes before lysis. Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was evaluated by ELISA. Data are from a representative experiment.
The IC50s were 1.9 mmol/L for S49076 and 0.5 nmol/L for nintedanib.

Figure 3. S49076 inhibits viability, motility, and three-dimensional colony formation of cancer cells expressing MET, AXL, or FGFRs. A, inhibition of viability of
GTL-16, SNU-16, and MKN-7 cells. Cells were incubated for 4 doubling times in the presence of a range of concentrations of S49076. Viability was measured
by MTT (GTL-16 and SNU-16) or PI (MKN-7) assay. IC50 values were 3, 167, and >10 mmol/L for GTL-16, SNU-16, and MKN-7, respectively. B, inhibition of
motility in A549 cells. A gap was made in conﬂuent cell monolayers which were then incubated for 40 hours in the presence of HGF and a range of
concentrations of S49076. Image analysis enabled calculation of an IC50 for inhibition of cell motility of 14 nmol/L. C, inhibition of colony formation of HLE,
JHH2, JHH4, and JHH6 cells in soft agar. Cultures were incubated for 8 to 18 days in a range of concentrations of S49076. Colonies were visualized and
counted with an automatic image analysis system.

more than 80% for all doses from 3.125 mg/kg at 2 and
6 hours posttreatment. At 6.25 mg/kg, inhibition of
MET phosphorylation was 95% and 58% at 6 and 16
hours posttreatment,
respectively. We previously
showed that chronic inhibition of MET in GTL-16 cells
led to attenuation of the phosphorylation of proximal
and distal transducers of the RAS pathway, including
AKT and p70S6K (2). At 6 hours postadministration, a
dose-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of
these signaling proteins was observed (Fig. 4B). The
relationship between dose of S49076 and blood levels is
shown in Fig. 4C and D. Apparent saturated absorption
and possibly saturated elimination occurred at 100 mg/kg
where blood concentration at 2 hours was 7 mmol/L.
Numerical pharmacokinetic data is provided in Supple-
mentary Table S1. For near-complete P(Tyr1349)MET
inhibition at 2 hours, a dose of 3.125 mg/kg corresponding
to a blood concentration of 100 nmol/L was required.
Given that the free-fraction of S49076 is estimated to be
20%, this corresponded to approximately 20 nmol/L
free compound. This is in agreement with the in vitro
evaluation of MET phosphorylation in GTL-16 cells where
10 nmol/L was required for 90% inhibition (Fig. 2B).
Interestingly, the inhibition of P(Tyr1349)MET at 6 hours
for all doses was similar to that at 2 hours. This could be
explained by high distribution of S49076 to the tumors, in
which the half-life for the dose of 3.125 mg/kg was
approximately 7 hours versus less than 2 hours in the
blood. Hence, at this dose, the intratumor concentration of
S49076 remained above 100 nmol/L for at least 16 hours
following treatment (Fig. 4E).

Cell assays using GTL-16 cells suggested that 65%
inhibition of P(Tyr1349)MET was required for a 90%
inhibition of tumor cell viability (Figs. 2B and 3A). Taking
into account the inhibition at 16 hours, a minimum daily
dose of between 6.25 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg would
therefore be expected to lead to around 90% inhibition
of tumor growth in this xenograft model. At the end of the
four-week treatment period, inhibition of tumor growth
was 69%, 82%, 91%, 95%, and 103% for the doses of 3.125,
6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 5A). This
corresponds to between 41% and 91% inhibition of MET
phosphorylation at the 16-hour time point in the primary
pharmacodynamics study (Figs. 4A and 5C) and agrees
with the predictions of the relationship between the in
vitro inhibition of MET and cell viability. The antitumor
activity of S49076 was conﬁrmed in U87-MG human
glioblastoma xenografts in which MET is activated by
autocrine HGF. At the end of the second week of treat-
ment, inhibition of tumor growth was 90%, 78%, and 103%
for the doses of 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg, respectively, and
at 50 mg/kg tumors regressed by 68% (Fig. 5B).

The ability of S49076 to inhibit the in vivo phosphory-
lation of FGFR2 was shown in SNU-16 subcutaneous
xenografts. Two hours following administration, inhibi-
tion of FGFR2 phosphorylation was 93% at 12.5 mg/kg.
This corresponded to 1 mmol/L blood concentration (Fig.
4C) and approximately 200 nmol/L free compound. This
is in agreement with the in vitro evaluation of FGFR2
phosphorylation in SNU-16 cells where 300 nmol/L was
required for complete inhibition (Fig. 2B). To maintain
more than 80% inhibition at 6 and at 16 hours, a dose of 50

function of time following S49076 administration at a range of doses (D). Blood levels predicted to be necessary for more than 90% inhibition of MET and FGFR
phosphorylation are indicated (C). Tumor and blood concentrations are shown as a function of time following administration of 3.125 mg/kg S49076 (E).

mg/kg was required (Fig 5D). The inhibition of FGFR2
signaling was conﬁrmed by the parallel loss of Tyr436
phosphorylation on the FGFR-associated adaptor protein
FRS2 (Fig. 5E). Tumor growth inhibition by oral admin-
istration of S49076 in these SNU-16 tumors was studied
using a once-daily or twice-daily oral treatment schedule.
At the end of the treatment period, inhibition of tumor
growth was 61%, 91%, and 100% for the once daily doses
of 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg, respectively, and 102% and
103% for the twice daily doses of 37.5 and 50 mg/kg,
respectively (Fig. 5F).

S49076 is active in a bevacizumab-resistant model
and totally inhibits the growth of colon carcinoma
xenografts in association with bevacizumab

Bevacizumab is a VEGF antagonist approved in com-
bination for treatment of several diseases including colo-

rectal cancers. However, responses are only partial and of
limited duration (49). In subcutaneous HT-29 colon car-
cinoma xenografts, twice weekly treatment with bevaci-
zumab at 10 mg/kg led to 71% inhibition of tumor growth
at the end of treatment (Fig. 6A). HT-29 cells express
VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 (50), so this effect may have been
due to a combination of effects on the vasculature and the
tumor cells themselves. S49076 alone at 100 mg/kg per
day also only induced a partial inhibition of 65%. This was
to be expected as this tumor was not found to be sensitive
to S49076 in either monolayer or three-dimensional soft
agar culture. However, combined therapy with bevacizu-
mab and S49076 led to near total arrest of tumor growth.
To determine whether tumors with acquired resistance to
bevacizumab were sensitive to S49076 a LS-174T xeno-
graft model of colon carcinoma was used in which tumors
ceased to respond to bevacizumab within 2 to 3 weeks of

treatment (Fig. 6B). Markedly, in this model, subsequent
treatment with S49076 led to complete tumor growth
arrest, suggesting a switch from dependency on VEGFR
for angiogenesis to a dependency on MET, AXL, or FGFR.

Discussion

MET, AXL, and FGFRs have been associated with
tumor progression in a wide variety of human malignan-
cies, where they act individually or in synergy to activate
concerted downstream signaling networks. A major
emerging role of these RTKs is in cancers where primary
or acquired resistance is observed to existing therapies,
including those targeting other RTKs. A drug that will
simultaneously target MET, AXL, and FGFRs will thus be
of potential beneﬁt not only for patients where any one of
these receptors is activated individually, but also in those
cases where combined inhibition of these RTKs is required
for maximal therapeutic efﬁcacy.

Here, we describe the pharmacologic properties of a
novel, potent, orally active ATP-competitive tyrosine
kinase inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3.
S49076 inhibited these kinases and clinically relevant
mutated isoforms in isolated enzyme assays with IC50s
of below 20 nmol/L. Although the clinical incidence of
MET mutations in cancer is relatively rare as compared
with that seen for the FGFRs, it is possible that mutations
in MET may emerge as a mechanism of resistance to
certain of the highly selective wild-type MET inhibitors
currently in clinical trials (1). In cell assays, S49076 inhib-
ited the autophosphorylation of MET in the low nanomo-
lar range and the autophosphorylation of AXL and

FGFR1/2/3 at IC50 values of less than 200 nmol/L. Down-
stream signaling from these receptors via adaptor pro-
teins and through AKT or ERK1/2 was inhibited at similar
concentrations. Importantly, unlike many moderately
selective or multikinase inhibitors, S49076 is not a potent
inhibitor of VEGFR2 in cell assays. Although VEGFR2 is
implicated in tumor angiogenesis, it also plays a major
physiologic role in the maintenance of vascular tone, and
its inhibition by other RTK inhibitors limits dosing of these
molecules in the clinic (47).

The target-speciﬁc activity of S49076 was further shown
in functional cell assays, where S49076 potently reduced
the viability in monolayer cultures of both MET- and
FGFR2-dependent gastric cancer cells while having no
effect on a third gastric cancer cell line reported to be
dependent on EGFR. Major roles of MET in cancer pro-
gression are the promotion of cell migration, invasion, and
metastasis. The potential of S49076 to block MET-driven
cancer cell motility was shown by the potent inhibition of
the MET-driven migration of
lung carcinoma cells.
Regarding AXL, no cell line has yet been identiﬁed in
which this RTK has been shown to have a major role in
viability in monolayer culture. Indeed, preclinical and
clinical studies suggest that the principal roles of AXL
may be in processes linked to metastasis rather than in
progression of the primary tumor (5). However, here we
show that S49076 potently inhibits the three-dimensional
growth in soft agar of hepatocarcinoma cells overexpres-
sing activated forms of AXL and FGFR2, whereas little
effect was seen on a hepatocarcinoma cell line in which
AXL was expressed at much lower levels. Interestingly,

Burbridge et al.

none of these cell lines was sensitive to S49076 in mono-
layer culture, indicating a major role of AXL in anchorage-
independent growth. Further work will be required to
determine the relative importance of AXL and FGFR2 in
the survival of these cell lines, although, in light of the
published roles of AXL in resistance, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that simultaneous inhibition of AXL and
FGFR2 may be required for efﬁcacy in these models.
Further investigation of the mechanism of action of
S49076 in these models is in progress.

In animal pharmacodynamic studies, oral administra-
tion of S49076 to nude mice at subtoxic doses led to the
inhibition of MET phosphorylation in subcutaneous GTL-
16 human gastric carcinoma xenografts in a dose-depen-
dent and time-dependent manner. Inhibition was more
than 80% for all doses from 3.125 mg/kg at 2 and 6 hours
posttreatment, whereas a dose of 6.25 mg/kg was
required to give more than 50% inhibition at 16 hours.
Pharmacokinetics in nude mice was linear up to 50 mg/kg,
and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies showed
a good relationship between blood concentrations and
inhibition of MET phosphorylation. S49076 was highly
distributed to the tumors and at doses of 6.25 mg/kg and
higher, more than 50% inhibition of MET phosphorylation
was retained at 16 hours. Following chronic once daily
treatment in this GTL-16 model, more than 80% tumor
growth inhibition by S49076 was observed for the doses of
6.25 mg/kg and higher at the end of treatment. Impor-
tantly,
the relationship between inhibition of tumor
growth and reduction of MET phosphorylation observed
in the pharmacodynamics study was in agreement with
predictions from cellular assays. Marked tumor growth
inhibition was also seen in the subcutaneous U87-MG
human glioblastoma model, which displays an HGF-MET
autocrine loop. In this model, the tumor regression
observed at 50 mg/kg may have been due to additional
inhibition of AXL and the FGFRs, possibly via inhibition
of angiogenesis, as other MET inhibitors, such as crizoti-
nib, do not cause tumor shrinkage in this model (51). The
in vivo inhibition of the phosphorylation of FGFR2 by
S49076 was shown in SNU-16 gastric tumor xenografts.
Two hours following administration, inhibition of FGFR2
phosphorylation was more than 90% at 12.5 mg/kg. In this
tumor, to maintain more than 50% inhibition of P-FGFR2
at 6 and 16 hours, a dose of 37.5 mg/kg or more was
required. This inhibition of the phosphorylation of FGFR2
was mirrored by a reduction in the phosphorylation of the
downstream adaptor protein, FRS2. In this model, dose-
dependent inhibition of tumor growth was observed
following either once-daily or twice-daily treatment.
Together, these studies show robust inhibition of both
MET and FGFR at well-tolerated doses giving rise to
marked inhibition of tumor growth. On the basis of this
data, both once-daily and twice-daily administration
schedules are being investigated in the clinic. To date, no
xenograft models have been identiﬁed where growth of
the primary tumor is dependent on the activity of AXL
alone. However, the potent inhibition of AXL signaling by

S49076 in cell assays at concentrations inferior to those
required to inhibit the FGFRs strongly suggest that this
target will also be hit in animal models. More complex
models where AXL has been implicated in breast tumor
metastasis (5) are currently being explored.

Except the rare MET-addicted tumors, one of the major
applications of MET inhibitors will likely be in cancers
where resistance preexists or has developed against other
targeted therapies (1). One such therapy is bevacizumab,
which blocks the interaction of VEGF with its receptors,
VEGFR1/2/3. Preclinical
studies have shown that
although continuous VEGF pathway inhibition in endo-
thelial cells of the tumor vasculature will initially slow
tumor growth via inhibition of angiogenesis, this will be
followed by rapid revascularization and increased tumor
invasiveness, most likely due to induction of hypoxic
conditions, upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1,
and increased expression of proangiogenic genes includ-
ing MET (49). In addition, MET activity has been shown to
regulate the secretion of VEGF by tumor cells (50). Inter-
estingly, VEGFRs may be expressed by tumor cells also,
and a recent study using models of glioblastoma has
elegantly shown the role of VEGF in the recruitment of
the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) to a MET/
VEGFR2 heterocomplex,
thereby suppressing MET
autophosphorylation in response to HGF. Thus, although
knockout of VEGF in glioblastoma tumors grown intra-
cranially in mice led to prolongation of survival, increased
HGF-induced MET phosphorylation was observed.
Knockdown of MET in these VEGF-null glioblastoma
tumors further extended survival (20). Although it is not
yet known whether this interaction between VEGFRs,
MET, and PTP1B exists in cancers other than glioblasto-
mas, the coexpression of VEGFR and MET by tumors of
various origin makes a similar mechanism of MET acti-
vation likely. Together with the implication of MET in
angiogenesis, these results clearly identify clinical poten-
tial for combined anti-VEGF and anti-MET therapy. The
fact that both AXL and the FGFRs also play a role in tumor
angiogenesis (5, 7) further reinforces the rationale for
combination of anti-VEGF therapy with S49076. This was
shown in a subcutaneous model of colon carcinoma, in
which both the tumor cells and the endothelial cells are
known to express VEGFRs. In this model, combined
treatment of S49076 with bevacizumab led to near total
inhibition of tumor growth as compared with only partial
inhibition by either S49076 or bevacizumab alone. It is
possible that this was due to a combination of the effects of
VEGFR, MET, AXL, and FGFR inhibition in both the
tumor and endothelial cells. In the clinic, responses to
bevacizumab are of limited duration (49). In a colon
carcinoma model created to recapitulate this acquired
resistance to bevacizumab treatment, S49076 led to com-
plete tumor growth arrest, suggesting a switch from
dependency on VEGFR for angiogenesis to a dependency
on MET, AXL, or FGFR. Together, these models showing
preclinical antitumor efﬁcacy in association with bevaci-
zumab and in bevacizumab-resistant tumors suggests

1760

that S49076 may be of beneﬁt in combination with bev-
acizumab in colorectal cancer treatment in the clinic.

In recent years, a number of studies have shown a major
role of not only MET but also AXL/MER and FGFRs in
primary or acquired resistance to diverse anticancer ther-
apies, including chemeotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy,
and targeted therapies. Indeed, it seems likely that a
prominent clinical use of agents targeting these RTKs will
be in association with existing or emerging treatments.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that an increasing number
of cancer types are being identiﬁed in which two or more
of these RTKs have been reported to play a role in resis-
tance mechanisms, either independently or together.
These cancers include EGFR inhibitor-resistant NSCLC
(17, 34, 35), BRAF-inhibitor resistant BRAFV600E-mutat-
ed melanoma (36–38), and chemotherapy-resistant AML
(13, 39) in which all three RTKs have been shown to play a
role. Both MET and AXL have been implicated in and
lapatinib-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer (40, 41).
Taken together, this emerging understanding of clinical
resistance mechanisms and the data presented in this
report concerning S49076, a novel, potent inhibitor of
MET, AXL, and FGFRs, clearly indicate the clinical poten-
tial of S49076 either alone or in association with other
therapies in a wide range of tumor types. In animal
models, blood and tumor levels of S49076 were consistent
with robust inhibition of these targets. Importantly, the
unique kinase inhibition proﬁle of S49076 may allow
