Summary

Inactivating mutations in NF1 underlie the prevalent fa-
milial cancer syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 [1].
The NF1-encoded protein is a Ras GTPase-activating
protein (RasGAP) [2]. Accordingly, Ras is aberrantly
activated in NF1-deﬁcient tumors; however, it is un-
known which effector pathways critically function in
tumor development. Here we provide in vivo evidence
that TORC1/mTOR activity is essential for tumorigene-
sis. Speciﬁcally, we show that the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin potently suppresses the growth of aggres-
sive NF1-associated malignancies in a genetically
engineered murine model. However, in these tumors
rapamycin does not function via mechanisms gener-
ally assumed to mediate tumor suppression, including
inhibition of HIF-1a and indirect suppression of AKT,
but does suppress the mTOR target Cyclin D1 [3].
These results demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors may
be an effective targeted therapy for this commonly
untreatable malignancy. Moreover, they indicate that
mTOR inhibitors do not suppress all tumor types
via the same mechanism, suggesting that current
biomarkers that rely on HIF-1a suppression may not
be informative for all cancers. Finally, our results
reveal important differences between the effects of
mTOR inhibition on the microvasculature in geneti-
cally engineered versus xenograft models and indicate
that the former may be required for effective preclinical
screening with this class of inhibitors.

Results and Discussion

NF12/2 MPNST Cell Lines Are Sensitive
to Rapamycin
An important feature of NF1 is the development of malig-
nant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are
highly aggressive and frequently metastasize [1]. Conse-
quently, greater than 50% of patients with MPNSTs pres-
ent with unresectable disease. Despite radiation and,
in some cases, chemotherapy, inoperable tumors rapidly
progress and are universally lethal [4]. As such, identify-
ing an effective treatment for NF1, in particular MPNSTs,
is critical.

We and others have demonstrated that NF1 inactiva-
tion results in the aberrant activation of the mTOR path-
way, raising the possibility that NF1-associated tumors
may be dependent on increased mTOR signaling [5, 6].
To test this hypothesis we ﬁrst examined the effects of
rapamycin on human and murine MPNST cell lines. All
MPNST cell lines were potently inhibited by low doses
of rapamycin with IC50 values %10 nM (Figures S1A
and S1B available online) [6].
In contrast, wild-type
Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts, and unrelated rapidly grow-
ing human tumor cell lines were not similarly sensitive
to rapamycin (Figures S1B and S1C). Consistent with
previous reports, low doses of rapamycin effectively
suppressed mTOR activity in ‘‘insensitive’’ cell types,
indicating that NF1-deﬁcient MPNSTs are particularly
dependent on mTOR activity and not that mTOR is
more easily suppressed in these cells (Figures S1C
and S1D) [7]. Notably, the sensitivity of NF1-deﬁcient
MPNSTs is similar to that of VHL-deﬁcient kidney tumor
cell lines, a tumor type that is currently showing promis-
ing results in clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors [7, 8].
Finally, we found that rapamycin functions by triggering
a growth arrest of MPNST cells rather than apoptosis or
senescence (Figure S2).

Rapamycin Rapidly Inhibits Tumor Growth in
a Genetically Engineered MPNST Mouse Model
To test the requirement for mTOR in tumorigenesis
in vivo and assess the therapeutic utility of rapamycin,
we utilized a genetically engineered spontaneous tumor
model of NF1. Mice carrying compound mutations in the
Nf1 and p53 tumor suppressors on the same chromo-
some (NPcis animals) develop aggressive MPNSTs
that are histologically indistinguishable from human
tumors with an average latency of 5 months [9, 10].
These lesions develop as a result of somatic loss of
the wild-type Nf1 and p53 alleles, and therefore are
also genetically similar to human MPNSTs. Animals
with palpable tumors (approximately 300 mm3) were
treated with 5 mg/kg rapamycin, as described in the Ex-
perimental Procedures section. Control NPcis mice died
on average in 12.2 days (Figure 1A), and tumors grew
9.7-fold (Figures 1B and 1D). In contrast, rapamycin
potently suppressed MPNST growth, resulting in only
a 0.04-fold increase in size, and allowed the animals to

survive. In no case did a rapamycin-treated animal die
but, rather, animals were sacriﬁced for interim analysis.
Thus, rapamycin has potent cytostatic effects on these
highly aggressive malignancies.

Inhibition of S6 phosphorylation was observed in
tumor and nontumor tissue, demonstrating that rapam-
cyin effectively suppressed the mTOR pathway in vivo
(Figure 1C and Figure S3). Moreover, we found that
rapamycin mediated its antitumor effects within 24 hr
by potently suppressing proliferation, as assessed by
BrDU incorporation in control and rapamycin-treated tu-
mors (Figure 1E). Consistent with in vitro observations,
markers of senescence were not detected (Figure S3
and data not shown). Tumor growth was dependent
on continued exposure to rapamycin, as tumors re-
exhibited S6 phosphorylation and resumed growing at
a rate comparable to control-treated tumors after rapa-
mycin removal (Figures 1F and 1G). Nevertheless, these
data demonstrate that these aggressive tumors can be
completely contained by an mTOR inhibitor. Notably,

several other targeted agents have been shown to be
clinically efﬁcacious for other human malignancies by
causing stable disease [11–13].

Effects of Rapamycin on the Microvasculature
in a Genetically Engineered Tumor Model
To determine how rapamycin was functioning, we inves-
tigated several proposed mechanisms of action. In some
xenograft models, rapamycin is thought to inhibit tumor
growth via effects on the microvasculature rather than
directly inhibiting tumor cell proliferation [14, 15]. How-
ever, the effects of rapamycin on the tumor microvascu-
lature have never been examined in a genetically engi-
neered model, which could be more stable than the
nascent microvasculature of a xenograft. Both control
and rapamycin treated tumors exhibited strong CD31
staining and a clearly deﬁned microvasculature for the
ﬁrst 8 days (Figures 2A and 2B), suggesting that the im-
mediate arrest induced by rapamycin was cell autonomous
and not secondary to effects on the microvasculature.

(C) Western-blot analysis of NPcis tumors showing expression of full-length poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), phosphorylation of the
ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235/236 (pS6), and total ribosomal S6 protein (S6).

Interestingly, however, after 14 days of treatment, rapa-
mycin did lead to a 38% decrease in microvessel density,
and by 25 days the microvasculature was signiﬁcantly
deteriorated (Figures 2A and 2B). Despite these observa-
tions, both control and rapamycin-treated tumors ex-
hibited little apoptosis (Figures 2A and 2C), which did
not increase with longer treatment times and appeared
to occur outside the endothelial cell compartment.

These ﬁndings differ from observations in xenograft
models, in which the microvasculature is rapidly disrup-
ted by mTOR inhibitors and tumors often regress [14,
15]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in sig-
nals that maintain the relatively established vasculature
of a spontaneously arising tumor versus those that sup-
port a developing xenograft. In this respect all xenograft
tumors, irrespective of mTOR status, might be sensitive
to the effects of mTOR inhibitors in ways that would not
necessarily predict the therapeutic response of human
tumors, a possibility consistent with previous ﬁndings
[14, 15]. Therefore the stringency of this model further
supports the potential translatability of these ﬁndings
to humans and highlights the utility of using genetically
engineered animals for preclinical studies, particularly
with mTOR inhibitors. Nevertheless, long-term rapamy-
cin treatment does ultimately disrupt the existing micro-
vasculature, which may occur via combined effects
on tumor and endothelial cells. In this regard perhaps

mTOR inhibitors can be used to ‘‘reset’’ the angiogenic
switch of sensitive tumor types, which could be clinically
exploited.

Rapamycin Does Not Suppress HIF-1a in MPNSTs
mTOR has been shown to regulate the expression of
HIF-1a [16, 17], and in some tumor types rapamycin is
thought to mediate its effects by suppressing HIF-1a
and HIF-1a transcriptional targets [8, 17]. Surprisingly,
however, we found that rapamycin had no effect on
HIF-1a protein (or transcript) levels in this tumor type
(Figures 3A and 3B and data not shown). Consistent
with the lack of an effect on HIF-1a expression, microar-
ray-based proﬁling studies combined with gene set en-
richment analysis (GSEA) revealed that rapamycin had
no signiﬁcant effect on a 30-member HIF-1a transcrip-
tional target gene set in MPNSTs in vivo (p = 0.334).
Real-time PCR analysis of a subset of genes was used
to further conﬁrm that rapamycin did not suppress
HIF-1a transcriptional targets. (Figure 3C). Taken to-
gether, these results suggest that rapamycin does not
mediate its growth inhibitory effects through suppres-
sion of HIF-1a or its target genes in this tumor type.

positron emission tomography (PET) scans, has been
proposed to serve as a pharmacodynamic readout of
mTOR inhibition in some tumor types [8] and has been

incorporated widely into clinical trials [18]. In part, the
driving rationale is based on observations that mTOR
inhibitors suppress HIF-1a in some tumor models (renal
cell carcinoma and PIN) [8, 17] and, consequentially,
suppress the target gene GLUT1, a glucose transporter

that regulates FDG uptake [19]. To conﬁrm that rapamy-
cin was not suppressing GLUT1 in MPNSTs, real-time
PCR was performed. Rapamycin did not signiﬁcantly
affect GLUT1 expression at any time point ranging
from 3–30 days (Figure 3D). Therefore, based on these

ﬁndings, FDG uptake would not be expected to be
affected by rapamycin in these lesions, suggesting
that FDG-PET may not be an appropriate biomarker
for all tumor types. More generally, these data suggest
that mTOR may contribute to tumorigenesis via distinct
effectors in different tumors.

Rapamycin Suppresses TORC1 and Does
Not Inhibit or Activate AKT
Two mTOR-containing complexes have been identiﬁed
in mammalian cells [3]. The TORC1 complex mediates
activation of mTOR effectors such as S6K, whereas

the TORC2 complex regulates AKT [3]. Although
TORC2 has classically been deﬁned as rapamycin
insensitive, long-term rapamcyin treatment of some hu-
man tumor cell lines inhibits TORC2 and AKT due to the
sequestration of nascent mTOR into FKBP12/rapamy-
cin/mTOR complexes [20]. Based on these observations
and additional xenograft studies, it is thought that in
some tumor types rapamycin may function by suppress-
ing AKT rather than TORC1 [20]. Importantly, however,
we found that AKT phosphorylation was not suppressed
by rapamycin in any case, even after 30 days of treatment
(Figures 4A and 4B), indicating that TORC1 inhibition

Rapamycin Suppresses Tumorigenesis in NF1

mediates the antitumor activity of rapamycin. We also
noted that rapamcyin did not generally activate AKT or
stabilize IRS proteins (Figure 4B), which has been arti-
culated as a potential therapeutic concern due to the
existence of a negative feedback loop emanating from
S6K [21, 22].

Rapamycin Suppresses Cyclin D1 Expression
in Nf1 Null MPNSTs In Vivo
Finally, we examined the expression of a panel of the
remaining direct and indirect mTOR targets proposed
to mediate the effects of rapamycin in other systems
including Cyclin D1, PDCD4, myc, p27, and p21 [23,
24]. Surprisingly, the only mTOR target in this list af-
fected by rapamycin in MPNSTS in vivo was Cyclin D1
(Figure 4C). Consistent with reported effects on Cyclin
D1 translation, rapamycin had no signiﬁcant effect on
mRNA levels but dramatically inhibited protein expres-
sion (Figures 4C and 4D). These results suggested that
Cyclin D1 might be one critical target of rapamycin
in MPNSTs in vivo. In support of this possibility, reduc-
tion of Cyclin D1 was observed within 24 hr of rapamycin
treatment in vivo, and rapamycin withdrawal resulted
in its re-expression (Figure 4E).

Interestingly, Nf1 inactivation has been shown pre-
viously to enhance Cyclin D1 expression in murine
Schwann cells [25]. Moreover, we found that reconstitut-
ing human MPNST cells with an active NF1 fragment
decreased Cyclin D1 expression, further supporting a con-
nection between these two pathways (Figure 4F). To de-
termine whether suppression of Cyclin D1 could mediate
the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin in this tumor
type, Cyclin D1 expression was reduced via shRNA con-
structs in MPNST cells. Suppression of Cyclin D1 signiﬁ-
cantly inhibited the proliferation of human MPNST cell
lines (Figures 4G and 4H), demonstrating that the prolifer-
ation of this tumor type is sensitive to Cyclin D1 levels.
However, ectopic expression of Cyclin D1 only slightly
ameliorated the growth suppressive effects of rapamycin
in vitro (Figures 4I and 4J). These results indicate that
although suppression of Cyclin D1 expression is sufﬁcient
to signiﬁcantly inhibit the proliferation of MPNSTs, rapa-
mycin is also likely to be acting on other unidentiﬁed
mTOR effectors, which may explain its potent cytostatic
effects in vivo. Nevertheless, Cyclin D1 has also been
implicated as a critical rapamycin target in mantle cell
lymphoma (MCL), a tumor type that has been shown to re-
spond to mTOR inhibitors in clinical trials [26], supporting
the potential importance of Cyclin D1 as a more general
target of mTOR in tumorigenesis.

Taken with previous ﬁndings, these data suggest that
rapamycin suppresses different tumor types via distinct
mechanisms, perhaps distinguished by inhibition of HIF-
1a (RCC, PIN), AKT [20], or Cyclin D1 (MCL and MPNST).
This heterogeneity should be considered when design-
ing efﬁcacy readouts, particularly as FDG-PET scanning
is now being widely incorporated into clinical trials with
mTOR inhibitors, but it may not represent a universally
accurate biomarker. This point is highly relevant for
MPNSTs, which are commonly diagnosed by FDG-PET
imaging; however, our results indicate that Cyclin D1
expression may represent a more informative biomarker
in this tumor type. In any case these data provide deﬁn-
itive in vivo evidence that mTOR/TORC1 is essential for

the pathogenesis of MPNSTs. Furthermore, in addition
to providing data to support clinical trials with mTOR
inhibitors, these ﬁndings provide insight that may be
necessary for effective trial design.

Experimental Procedures

NPcis Mice Generation, Treatment, and Measurement
of Tumor Volume
C57/BL6 NPcis mice have been previously described [9, 10]. Rapa-
mycin was administered intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg of body
weight, beginning at the time of tumor detection, with 5 days
on treatment and 2 days off. Rapamycin (Calbiochem) was initially
dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 25 mg/ml and
stored at 220C. Prior to injection, rapamycin was diluted 1:50
into the vehicle (an aqueous solution composed of 5.2% PEG
400 and 5.2% Triton 80; Sigma). Tumor volume was calculated
by measuring length and width of the lesion and with the formula
(length) 3 (width)2 3 (0.52). BrdU (10 mg/ml) was injected at a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 mg/g animal weight. BrdU incorporation was
quantiﬁed as the percent of BrdU-positive cells/number of hema-
toxylin-stained nuclei. All statistical analyses were done with
Student’s t test.

Immunoblots, Antibodies, and Retroviral Constructs
Tumor and tissue lysates were normalized and analyzed by immu-
noblot with the following antibodies as described [6]: total S6
ribosomal protein, phospho-S6 (S235/236), phospho-AKT (S473),
and total PARP (Cell Signaling Technology); DcR2 (Stressgen);
p53 and IRS1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); BrdU (Calbiochem);
CD31 and Cyclin D1 (PharMingen); Neuroﬁbromin (Bethyl); HIF-1a
(A&G Pharmaceutical); anti-HA tag (Covance); actin (Sigma); IRS-2
(Upstate); anti-Flag tag (Sigma); PDCD4. The following constructs
were used: pRetroSuper-GFP (shGFP), CyclinD1 (shCyD1), pBabe-
puro HA-tagged Cyclin D1, pBabe-Puro Flag-NF1 Gap-Related
Domain (NF1 GRD), which has been previously described [6].

Immunoﬂuorescence and Blood Vessel Density Quantitation
CD31 primary antibody (PharMingen) was incubated 1:50 overnight
at room temperature, followed by the secondary antibody (Alexa
594, goat anti-rat IgG, Molecular Probes) for 2 hr (1:500). TUNEL-
positive cells were detected with Promega’s DeadEnd TUNEL Kit
and were costained with Hoechst. For blood vessel density quanti-
tation, images of stained sections were reduced to 4 3 3 inches
(w 3 h), and a standard grid (1 cm) was applied to the image. Each
box (created by the grid) that displayed CD31-positive cells was
counted as 1, and the total number of CD31-positive boxes was de-
termined for the entire image. All statistical analyses were done with
Student’s t test.

Real-Time PCR
RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Standard curves
were generated from a dilution series of RNA isolated from the appro-
priate untreated control cells. Samples were run in triplicate, and
n-fold change was calculated with the following equation: n-fold
change = eDCt, where e = 10(21/slope) and DCt is the difference in
threshold cycle between samples. Real-time PCR reactions were
performed in triplicate using the Assays-on-Demand Taqman Gene
Expression Assays from Applied Biosystems and were normalized
with an internal control. Probe sets are as follows: Slc2a1
