Abstract

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are sarcomas of Schwann cell-lineage origin 
that occur sporadically or in association with the inherited syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1. 
To identify genetic drivers of MPNST development, we utilized the Sleeping Beauty (SB) 
transposon-based somatic mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of tumor protein p53 
(Trp53) function and/or overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Common 
insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and 106 MPNSTs identified 695 and 87 sites 
with a statistically significant number of recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison 
to human data sets revealed novel and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these sites. 
Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes identified many cooperating mutations 
that are enriched for in Wnt/CTNNB1, PI3K/Akt/mTor, and growth factor receptor signaling 
pathways. Lastly, we identified several novel proto-oncogenes including forkhead box R2 
(Foxr2), which we functionally validated as a proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, metastatic, nerve-
associated tumors, which occur sporadically (~50% cases) or in association with the 
inherited syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)1. The lifetime risk of developing a 
sporadic MPNST is 0.001%, compared to 5–13% for NF1 patients (1:3,000 people) where 
MPNSTs often arise from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas1,2. Despite advances in 
understanding MPNST biology, the primary treatment of MPNSTs, regardless of origin, is 
tumor resection followed by radiation and non-specific chemotherapeutic agents resulting in 
5-year survival rates of less than 25% in patients with metastatic disease3–6. The most 
commonly altered gene known to cause benign neurofibroma formation and further 
progression into MPNST is NF1, which encodes Neurofibromin 1, a RAS-GTPase 
activating protein that causes NF1 syndrome when mutated7–10. NF1 mutation causes 
increased and aberrant signaling through pro-growth and pro-proliferation signaling 
pathways (RAS/MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) in human neurofibromas and 
MPNST-derived cell lines11–13. Overexpression of growth factor receptors and ligands like 
EGFR, NRG, PDGF, HGF, SCF, and TGFβ1 are also observed in neurofibromas and 
MPNSTs with NF1 mutation14–19. Besides NF1 mutations, genomic aberrations have not 
been identified in neurofibromas. However, genomic aberrations including deletions and/or 
mutations of cell cycle regulators (TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A), gene amplification of growth 
factor receptors (ERBB2, EGFR, KIT, MET, and PDGFR), and the presence of hyperdiploid 
or near-triploid genomes commonly occur in human MPNSTs14–33. These observations 
suggest that progression to malignancy requires many cooperating genomic alterations. High 
levels of genomic complexity make the identification of human MPNST genetic drivers 
difficult and leave the following questions unanswered: 1) What gene(s) cooperate with NF1 
loss for MPNST formation? 2) What additional gene modules cooperate for MPNST 
formation? 3) What are the epigenetically altered drivers of MPNST formation? 4) What is 
the signature/identity of MPNST maintenance genes? Though some genes and genetic 
pathways are implicated in MPNST development, there are still many left to uncover to 
create effective therapies for human MPNST treatment.

Recently, the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system was utilized, in a tissue-specific 
manner in mice, to identify genetic drivers of numerous solid and blood cancers34–37. To 
identify MPNST drivers, we targeted SB transposon mutagenesis to Schwann cells and their 
precursors using the Cnp-Cre transgene and a conditional SB mutagenesis system35,38. Since 
mutations/deletions in TP53 and/or amplification or elevated expression of EGFR are 
commonly associated with human MPNSTs (24–75% and 25–70%, respectively), a 
conditional dominant-negative Trp53R270H allele and a Cnp-EGFR transgene were 
included23,39–42. Analysis of 375 SB-accelerated PNSTs uncovered 745 common-insertion 
site (CIS) associated genes (known and novel). We also identified genes and signaling 
pathways that cooperate for MPNST formation. We identified several novel proto-
oncogenes, including Foxr2 and described new functions for FOXR2 in human MPNST 
formation and maintenance. Thus, utilizing the SB mutagenesis system, we identified genes 
and genetic pathways that may provide new therapeutic targets for MPNST treatment.

RESULTS

SB mutagenesis accelerated neurofibroma development and progression to MPNST

Four experimental mouse cohorts underwent SB mutagenesis on wildtype or tumor pre-
disposing backgrounds following Cnp-Cre induction in Schwann cells and their precursors 
(Supplementary Fig. 1a)35,38,41,42. Mice lacking full components for SB mutagenesis served 
as controls. Predominantly, the Cnp-EGFR (hereafter called EGFR-overexpressing) and 
Cnp-Cre; Cnp-EGFR; Trp53R270H (hereafter called EGFR-overexpressing and p53-mutant) 
mice with or without SB mutagenesis developed nerve-associated tumors throughout the 
body (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1b). Nerve-associated tumors possessed 
histological features of Schwann cell tumor stages: Schwann cell hyperplasia, benign grade 
1 PNSTs (neurofibromas), and aggressive grade 3 PNSTs (MPNST in humans) 
(Supplmentary Fig. 1c–d). Mouse grade 3 PNSTs developed in anatomical regions observed 
in human MPNSTs (Supplementary Fig. 2a–b)6,43,44. Moreover, some control and SB-
derived grade 3 PNSTs contained regions of divergent cellular histological subtypes and 
differentiation events characteristic of some human MPNSTs (Supplementary Fig. 3a–
b)45–47. Neurofibromas displayed no divergent differentiation. Collectively, our mouse 
model data indicate that the common genetic changes in human MPNST produce a 
phenotype in mice that resembles the human disease.

To determine if SB mutagenesis accelerated tumor formation, SB expression and activity in 
neurofibromas and grade 3 PNSTs were first confirmed by immunohistochemistry and by 
PCR-excision assay (Supplementary Fig. 1e)48. Wildtype or p53-mutant mice undergoing 
transposition developed few Schwann cell tumors (~2–7%) (Figure 1a). As previously 
reported, EGFR-overexpressing mice developed nerve hyperplasia with low incidence of 
neurofibroma formation (~17%) and no grade 3 PNST formation (Figure 1a)41. In contrast, 
SB mutagenesis significantly enhanced neurofibroma formation (~35%, p=0.0155) and 
induced grade 3 PNST formation in EGFR-overexpressing mice (p=0.0141). EGFR-
overexpresing and p53-mutant transgenes cooperated to significantly increase neurofibroma 
and grade 3 PNST formation (p<0.0001, Figure 1a). SB mutagenesis on both pre-disposed 
alleles led to neurofibroma development, significantly increased grade 3 PNST development

(p=0.0005), and significantly reduced grade 3 PNST free-survival compared to both pre-
disposed alleles alone (p<0.0001, Figure 1b). Tumor penetrance for each genotype is 
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Overall, SB mutagenesis enhanced grade 3 PNST 
incidence compared to controls.

Identification of Schwann cell tumor driver-mutation genes

T2/Onc insertion sites from 269 SB-derived neurofibromas and 106 SB-derived grade 3 
PNSTs from 100 mice were analyzed to identify driver-mutations (CISs). We utilized two 
statistical methods to identify CISs: TAPDANCE CIS (td-CIS) and gene centric CIS (gCIS) 
analyses (See methods for details, Supplementary Data 1–2, Table 1, Supplementary Table 
2)49,50. td-CIS analysis identified 511 neurofibroma and 34 grade 3 PNST driver-mutations 
with 21 genes overlapping. gCIS analysis identified 535 neurofibroma and 75 grade 3 PNST 
driver-mutations with 32 genes overlapping. Accounting for coinciding CISs from each 
analysis, there were 87 grade 3 PNST (25.3% overlap) and 695 neurofibroma driver-
mutations (50.1% overlap) with 37 genes common to both tumor types.

Analysis of td-CIS association with tumor type identified significant driver-mutations in 
neurofibromas (n=47) and grade 3 PNSTs (n=10) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2, 
Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). Known Schwann cell tumor suppressor genes (TSG), Nf1 and 
Pten, were significantly associated with grade 3 PNSTs and identified in 34.9% 
(p=8.04E-06) and 30.2% (p=3.85E-06) of tumors, respectively13,51. In neurofibromas, Nf1 
and Pten insertions contributed to 16.4% and 14.1% of tumors, respectively. The most 
commonly mutated neurofibroma CISs were Csmd1 (46.8%, p=1.12E-05), Utrn (30.5%, 
p=0.02189) and Zbtb20 (29.4%, p=1.15E-05). Genes previously implicated in human 
MPNST formation were also identified: Bmpr2 (9.4%, p=0.005), Jak2 (5.7%, p=0.0013), 
and Nf2 (5.7%, p=0.0013).

The position/orientation of the T2/Onc murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter relative to 
the direction of gene transcription can be used to predict whether T2/Onc is likely to drive or 
disrupt gene transcription52. Transcriptional activation may occur if the majority of 
transposon insertions are orientated upstream of a gene or translational start site with MSCV 
promoters in the same direction as gene transcription; the gene would be a putative proto-
oncogene (e.g. Eras, Foxr2, and Zfp521) (Supplementary Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 3). 
Disruption of transcription may occur if the transposons land within a gene with no MSCV 
promoter orientation or insertion site bias within the locus; the gene would be a putative 
TSG (e.g. Nf1 and Pten) (Supplementary Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table 3). Twenty putative 
proto-oncogenes and sixty-seven putative TSGs were identified in grade 3 PNST CISs 
(Table 1, Supplementary Table 3).

Comparative analysis of grade 3 PNST CISs identified novel genes involved in MPNSTs

Relevance of the CIS-associated genes to human MPNST formation was evaluated by cross-
species comparative analysis of the grade 3 PNST CISs to previously generated human array 
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, 
human microarray expression, and methylome data from normal Schwann cells, 
neurofibromas, and MPNSTs (Figure 2)5,53,54. Utilizing human MPNST aCGH data, we

identified CISs with a tendency toward CNA-gains (n=31, ZBTB10, CDK13, RAB2A, 
SHFM1, CPNE3) and CNA-losses (n= 34, CDKN2A, JAK2, NF1, NF2, FAF1, PLAA, 
PICLAM) (Supplementary Table 4, Figure 2, Supplementary Fig. 6–7)54. Comparably, 
whole genome SNP analysis on additional MPNSTs (n=14) identified several CISs in 
chromosomal regions gained (BMPR2, CPNE3, EML4) and lost (CDKN2A, JAK2, PLAA) in 
>35% of the samples (Supplementary Table 5). However, many recurrently gained/lost 
genes were found in regions of large chromosomal rearrangements making it difficult to 
discern whether they are driver or passenger mutations. To address this concern, methylome 
and microarray expression data from human Schwann cell tumors were analyzed.

Promoter CpG Island Shore (CpG-IS) methylation status is predictive of gene expression: 
hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing and hypomethylation is associated with 
gene expression53. We used MPNST whole methylome data to analyze the methylation 
patterns of the promoter CpG-IS regions53. Fifty-five CIS genes showed significant 
differential hypo- or hyper-methylation patterns in their CpG-IS regions (see Online 
Methods, Supplementary Table 6, Figure 2). Six CISs displayed hypomethylation in >10% 
of tumors (BMPR2, PRDX1, PTPN14, BAZ1B, JMY, MAEA), while only KLF13 was 
hypermethylated in >10% of MPNSTs.

To assess the impact of CNAs and methylation patterns on gene expression, we utilized 
microarray expression data. Seventy-seven CISs had a human homolog on the microarray 
(Supplementary Fig. 8)5. Microarray expression data predict CISs either upregulated 
(EIF4ENIF1, EML4, PTCH1, TRIP10, ZBTB10, ZNF217, ZNF521) or downregulated 
(TAOK1, PICALM, NF1, NF2, SPAG9, SRGAP2, PTEN) in disease progression to MPNSTs 
(Supplementary Fig. 8, Figure 2). Overall, genes we predicted to be oncogenes and TSGs 
from the SB screen displayed the expected biases in overexpression/CNA-gains/
hypomethylation and reductions in gene expression/CNA-losses/hypermethylation (Figure 
2). These genes include known drivers of MPNST formation (CDKN2A, PTEN, NF1) and 
novel candidate drivers (BAZ1B, FOXR2, ERAS, PLAA, DIP2C, PICALM).

Lastly, we utilized the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC-v63) database to 
assess alterations of the CISs in other human cancers (Supplementary Table 7)55. The grade 
3 PNST CIS list is significantly enriched for in the Cancer Gene Census (12/488 genes, FET 
p=2.99x10−06, hypergeometric test p=3.206496x10−06) indicating we identified driver-
mutations common to many cancer types.

MPNST candidate genes are enriched in specific signaling pathways and processes

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and the Database for Annotations, Visualization and 
Integrated Discover (DAVID) were used to identify significantly altered signaling pathways 
in grade 3 PNST CISs (Supplementary Tables 8–9). IPA identified significant enrichment in 
cancer-associated signaling pathways (p=8.69x10−09–3.89x10−03, n=25 genes) including 
PI3K/AKT (p=1.55x10−03), ERK/MAPK (p=3.79x10−02), Wnt/CTNNB1 (p=5.20x10−04) 
and BMP/TGF-β (p=4.15x10−02). Cell cycle regulation was the most significantly altered 
pathway (n=21 genes, p=9.87x10−07-3.89x10−03 and n=6 genes, FET p=2.85x10−05, 
respectively). Additional cancer-associated signaling pathways included Jak-STAT (FET 
p=5.90x10−03) and TGF-beta (FET p=8.40x10−03). Combining data from DAVID analysis,

IPA, and literature reviews, we classified the CISs into three major signal transduction 
pathways implicated in MPNST development: PI3K/AKT/mTOR (16.1%), 
MAPK/ERK/JNK/p38 (21.8%), and Wnt/CTNNB1 (17.2%) (Figure 3a)51,56–58. Seven CISs 
(Bmpr2, Cbp, Dyrk1a, Mark2, Mycn, Ppp2r2a, Pten) are involved in signaling through all 
three pathways as canonical members and/or effectors.

Co-occurring CISs in grade 3 PNSTs

Co-occurrence analysis was performed to identify genes frequently mutated together in 
grade 3 PNSTs at a higher frequency than expected by chance49. Co-occurrence analysis of 
the 34 td-CISs identified 99 pairs of co-occurring CISs (co-CIS) (Supplementary Table 10). 
Several genes were identified as co-CISs with the known MPNST driver Nf1: Pten, Dyrk1a, 
Ppp6r3, Taok1, Picalm, Top2b, Srgap2, and Ccny (Supplementary Table 10, Figure 3b). Nf1 
and Pten were present in the highest percentage of tumors as single CISs (34.9% and 30.2% 
respectively, Table 1) and co-occurred in 13/106 grade 3 PNSTs (FET p=7.05x10−05) 
compared to 1/269 neurofibromas (Figure 4a). Human microarray expression data 
demonstrated a reduction in NF1 and PTEN with disease progression to MPNSTs. 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). These data suggest that co-occurring mutations in Nf1 and Pten 
cooperate to form grade 3 PNSTs and may cooperate in human MPNST progression.

To address whether Nf1 and Pten mutations cooperate to form Schwann cell tumors in vivo, 
we generated transgenic mice with biallelic inactivation of Nf1 and heterozygous loss of 
Pten in Cnp-Cre expressing cells. Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ mice had a significantly 
decreased median survival of 101 days compared to control Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f (185 days, 
Logrank p=0.017) and Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+ (323 days, Logrank p<0.0001) mice (Figure 4b). 
Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ mice (n=5) succumbed to paralysis-related deaths with peripheral 
nerve hyperplasia and tumors, the majority of which were grade 1 neurofibromas (Figure 
4c). Importantly, grade 1 neurofibromas in the extremities (sciatic nerve, brachial plexus) 
contained regions of high-grade PNST histology (Figure 4d). Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f mice (n=4) 
developed nerve hyperplasia and neurofibromas but no high-grade PNSTs. Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+ 
mice (n=15) developed hematopoietic malignancies rather than Schwann cell-related 
phenotypes.

These data are consistent with our previous experiments in which Dhh-Cre; Nf1f/f; 
Ptenf/+mice only developed neurofibromas, while Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ mice had shorter 
median survival and possessed regions of high-grade PNST development59. Both mouse 
models demonstrate the cooperativity of Nf1 and Pten mutations for accelerating Schwann 
cell tumorigenesis. Additional cooperating mutations identified in the co-occurrence 
analysis may provide insight into cooperating signaling pathways that promote MPNST 
formation in humans.

The novel proto-oncogene FOXR2 has a role in human MPNST maintenance

Foxr2 is a grade 3 PNST CIS predicted to be a proto-oncogene due to the orientation and 
position of T2/Onc insertions (Figure 5a). mRNA fusion transcripts between the T2/Onc 
MSCV promoter/SD and Foxr2 were identified in tumors with T2/Onc insertions in the 
Foxr2 locus (Figure 5b). The sequenced products demonstrated splicing from the T2/Onc

splice donor into each exon of the Foxr2 gene, including a cryptic exon not previously 
annotated in intron 2 (labeled 2′) (Figure 5a–b). T2/Onc fusion transcripts led to increased 
Foxr2 mRNA and protein expression in tumors and tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting that 
Foxr2 functions as a proto-oncogene (Figures 5c–e).

Immunohistochemical analysis of a human tissue microarray demonstrated increased 
cytoplasmic FOXR2 expression in MPNSTs compared to neurofibromas (Figure 6a–b). 
FOXR2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in MPNST cell lines compared to normal 
Schwann cells and CDK4/TERT immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSCs) (Figure 6c)59. 
MPNST cell lines also demonstrated cytoplasmic FOXR2 expression (Figure 6d).

FOXR2 is a novel gene with unknown function. To explore the role of FOXR2 in MPNST 
formation, we developed constructs to overexpress the full-length cDNA or knock out the 
gene using TAL-effector nucleases (TALENs) (Supplementary Fig. 9a–b) in iHSCs and 
MPNST cell lines5,59. FOXR2 overexpression in the iHSC clone HSC1λ increased total 
FOXR2 protein and cytoplasmic staining, minimally increased in vitro proliferation, and 
significantly increased soft-agar colony formation compared to luciferase control (two-tailed 
t-test p<0.0001) (Figure 7a–c, Supplementary Fig. 10a). Xenograft experiments 
demonstrated no tumor formation in the control HSC1λ cells, but 3/5 mice harboring 
FOXR2 overexpressing cells developed a tumor (Supplementary Fig. 11a–b). This 
phenotype was confirmed by TALEN-mediated targeted knockout of FOXR2 in S462-TY 
and STS26T human MPNST cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 9b). TALENs that generated 
knockout or heterogeneous mutations (called mutation detected) of FOXR2 caused loss of 
protein by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9c, Figure 7d). FOXR2 knockout and 
mutation detected cell lines had reduced proliferation and significant reductions in colony 
formation ability compared to HPRT knockout control cells (t-test p<0.0001) 
(Supplementary Fig. 10b–c, Figure 7e). Additionally, FOXR2 loss inhibited the ability of 
STS26T cells to form tumors in xenograft experiments compared to HRPT knockout 
controls (Figure 7f). shRNA-mediated FOXR2 knockdown in STS26T and S462-TY cell 
lines confirmed the FOXR2 TALEN results in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 10d–e). 
Collectively, FOXR2 has minor effects on proliferation in vitro, whereas effects on 
anchorage independent growth and tumorigenicity are more profound.

DISCUSSION

We performed a large, forward genetic screen in Schwann cells utilizing SB somatic cell 
mutagenesis. We identified hundreds of genes that cooperated with EGFR overexpression 
and p53-loss of function to form neurofibromas and grade 3 PNSTs. Many co-CISs were 
identified, suggesting that specific, cooperating genetic mutations are required for tumor 
development. Also, CISs were identified in known signaling pathways altered in human 
MPNSTs: Wnt/CTNNB1, PI3K/Akt/mTor, and growth factor signaling11–13,58. Lastly, we 
identified several novel proto-oncogenes, including Foxr2, and elucidated a role for FOXR2 
in human MPNST maintenance.

SB mutagenesis alone or on the Trp53R270H background was insufficient for Schwann cell 
tumorigenesis compared to previous reports in which SB alone caused tumors35,60. This may

be explained by differences in the number of cells susceptible to SB mutagenesis. Compared 
to colonic epithelial cells, which have a high turnover rate, that of Schwann cells is near zero 
unless injury occurs60,61. Moreover, SB mutagenesis is a random event, and mutations that 
confer selective advantage for clonal outgrowth are rare events. Taken together, targeting a 
small population of cells with a low turnover rate may produce fewer SB-induced tumors 
unless a pre-existing mutation(s), such as EGFR-overexpression, is present to expand target 
cell populations41.

CIS overlap between two methods for defining CISs in grade 3 PNSTs and neurofibromas 
was 65% and 68%, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). The discordance in CIS 
calling is based predominantly on methods used to identify a CIS49,50. gCIS analysis is 
based on window sizes corresponding to annotated genes and 15,000bp upstream to account 
for the promoter region50. Therefore, the number of insertions required to be deemed a gCIS 
depends on gene size (i.e., large genes require many insertions while smaller genes require 
fewer insertions). TAPDANCE analysis generates random window sizes throughout the 
genome and does not require gene annotation to identify CISs, as 4 ‘gene barren’ regions 
were identified in the neurofibroma CIS list (Supplementary Table 2)49. These regions could 
contain important enhancer elements, unannotated genes, non-coding RNAs, or other gene 
regulatory elements. The two methods are complimentary and enhance CIS identification.

Based on the number of neurofibromas (n=269) and grade 3 PNSTs (n=106) sequenced, 
there is a disproportionate number of CISs between neurofibromas (695) and grade 3 PNSTs 
(87). Analysis of unique transposon insertion site non-redundant (nr) regions identified 
33,022 and 139,543 nr-regions for grade 3 PNSTs and neurofibromas, respectively. This 
discrepancy can be reconciled by the genetic heterogeneity of the SB-induced tumors. The 
fewer grade 3 PNSTs nr-regions were sequenced at a higher frequency compared to the 
neurofibroma nr-regions, suggesting that few cells acquired mutations in strong genetic 
drivers that conferred a selective advantage for clonal outgrowth. These clonal insertions 
were sequenced thousands of times more than in the more genetically heterogeneous 
neurofibromas. Additionally, it is possible only a few, strong driver mutations in Schwann 
cells are required for progression to grade 3 PNSTs, while there are many alterations that are 
sufficient to cause neurofibroma formation. For example, cells may achieve many mutations 
but only the right combination of two or more genes may drive high-grade tumor formation, 
as we observed in the Nf1/Pten model. Lastly, we can reliably identify low-penetrant CISs 
with higher statistical power given the larger neurofibroma sample size compared to the 
grade 3 PNSTs.

CIS analysis identified a disproportionate number of putative TSGs compared to proto-
oncogenes (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2), which also occurred in other solid tumor SB 
screens34,60,62 and likely has several explanations: 1) The strength of the T2/Onc MSCV 
promoter is not strong enough to sufficiently transcriptionally activate proto-oncogenes. A 
body-wide SB screen using the CAGGs promoter instead of MSCV in T2/Onc identified a 
larger spectrum of tumors and CISs35. 2) T2/Onc can insert in both orientations with less 
insertion position bias within or near a gene to cause inactivation meaning a greater chance 
of genes being inactivated. Alternatively, for driving oncogenes we observed a clustering of

T2/Onc insertions in the promoter region or 5′UTR that predominantly orient to drive 
transcription.

Comparative genomic analysis reliably identified genes previously implicated in human 
MPNST formation (i.e., CDKN2A, NF1, PTEN)27,63. We also identified novel genes 
recurrently overexpressed/CNA-gains/hypomethylated (BAZ1B, FOXR2, ERAS) and 
underexpressed/biallelically inactivated/hypermethylated (DIP2C, PLAA, PICALM) in 
human MPNSTs (Figure 2, Supplementary Figs. 6–8, Supplementary Tables 4–6)63,64. 
However, we identified genes (e.g., ZBTB10 and EML4) with CNA gains in human 
MPNSTs predicted to be disrupted by SB mutagenesis. This discrepancy may reflect 
differences in mouse versus human MPNST formation and/or CNAs observed in human 
MPNSTs may mask the function of the gene in tumor progression. Additionally, many of 
the CISs could be categorized into signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, 
MAPK/ERK/JNK/p38, and Wnt/CTNNB1) (Figure 3a, Supplementary Tables 8–9). 
Collectively, these data provide novel gene drivers/signaling pathways that potentially 
promote human MPNST formation. Further experimental evidence is required to determine 
the contribution any candidate driver gene(s)/pathways may have on MPNST development.

Nf1 and Pten were most frequently mutated in our screen, and Pten was significantly co-
mutated with Nf1 in grade 3 PNSTs. Loss of NF1 alone is not sufficient for MPNST 
formation in genetically engineered mouse models of Nf1 loss65–68. Gregorian et. al 
demonstrated that monoallelic inactivation of Pten in Schwann cells with activated 
KRasG12D overexpression caused grade 3 PNST formation51. Neither mutation alone was 
sufficient to generate grade 3 PNSTs. These data suggest that, like Nf1, Pten mutations alone 
are insufficient for MPNST formation. Our mouse model of biallelic Nf1 inactivation and 
Pten heterozygosity demonstrated cooperation for high-grade PNST formation compared to 
loss of either allele alone (Figure 3a–d). We attempted to generate biallelic loss of Nf1 and 
Pten with the Cnp-cre model, but no live mouse originated from the crosses with the 
expected Mendelian ratio of 1:8. Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/f may be embryonic lethal. However, 
Nf1 loss in the context of Pten heterozygosity produced tumors with regions containing 
high-grade PNSTs, which is consistent with the observation that PTEN expression is not 
completely lost in human MPNSTs. The previously reported Dhh-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ mouse 
model presented with neurofibromas and required biallelic inactivation of the second Pten 
allele for high-grade PNST formation59. Therefore, it is important to consider gene dosage, 
co-mutations, and timing of mutation induction to determine effective mouse models for 
developmental and therapeutic studies.

FOXR2 is a forkhead-box (FOX) transcription factor family member identified in silico on 
chromosome Xp11.21 in humans. FOXR2 is an ortholog of FOXR1 that shares 57.7% amino 
acid identity69. FOXR1 is a transcriptional inhibitor of FOX family target genes such as 
p27Kip170. Similar to FOXR1, FOXR2 is expressed in mouse embryonic development 
(E9.5) with reduced expression in adult tissues69. Human Protein Atlas and ONCOMINE 
indicate FOXR2 expression is low and variegated in normal adult human tissues, but 
expression is increased at the genomic (CNA gains) and protein levels in several 
cancers71–73. COSMIC-v63 reports 18 point mutations within FOXR2 from 4,862 
samples55. We utilized the MutationAssessor program to determine the functional impact of

the 18 point mutations on cancer, which ranged from neutral to medium with 4 point-
mutations identified in the Fork-head DNA binding domain (Supplementary Table 12). This 
may indicate that FOXR2 mutations are not as pivotal to cancer formation as increased 
expression. Our comparative genomic analysis and functional data predict that FOXR2 is a 
proto-oncogene in human MPNST maintenance. FOX superfamily members have been 
implicated in human cancers through mechanisms like gene amplifications and 
translocations74. Further studies are warranted to determine the extent of FOXR2 
involvement in tumor development and its function in normal somatic cells.

Interestingly, in the grade 3 PNSTs containing T2/Onc-Foxr2 fusion transcripts we observed 
splicing into the first annotated exon of Foxr2 where splice acceptor elements were not 
previously described (Figure 5). We identified RNA splicing elements (branch point ‘A’, 
polyprimidine tract, and ‘AG’ boundary) within 35 nucleotides of the first annotated Foxr2 
exon indicating the potential for splicing. Furthermore, FOXR2 full-length cDNA 
unexpectedly encodes two unique protein isoforms (Figure 7b,d), and we observed a bias in 
isoform loss following TALEN knockout (Figure 7d). The FOXR2 locus contains five in-
frame methionines of which four have optimal Kozak sequences (amino acid positions 1, 25, 
53, 58, and 81) with the following predicted molecular weights: 35.93kDa, 32.94 kDa, 
29.76kDa, 29.17kDa, and 26.81kDas. Further studies are necessary to define the Foxr2 locus 
in mouse and human and to determine the implications of the use of the alternative start 
codons in tumorigenesis.

Overall, using a SB forward genetic screen we identified hundreds of candidate cancer driver 
genes that promote Schwann cell tumorigenesis. Moreover, we determined a new functional 
role for the novel proto-oncogene FOXR2 in human MPNST maintenance. Further 
functional testing of additional CISs may reveal new genetic pathways to target for 
treatment of human MPNSTs.

ONLINE METHODS

Transgenic animals and tumor isolation

Three transgenes were used to induce SB mutagenesis in Schwann cells: a conditionally 
expressed SB transposase enzyme (R26-lsl-SB11)35, a Schwann cell specific Cre-
recombinase controlled by the CNP promoter (Cnp-Cre)38, and a concatomer of oncogenic 
transposons (T2/Onc15)48. Triple transgenic mice (Cnp-Cre; R26-lsl-SB11; T2/Onc15) 
undergo insertional mutagenesis in Schwann cells. MPNST predisposing alleles, Cnp-EGFR 
and conditional Trp53R270H alleles, were also included41,42. Mouse cohorts are shown in

Figure 1a. Genotyping PCR was performed on phenol-chloroform extracted mouse-tail 
DNA as previously described34,38,41,42.

Peripheral nerves and tumors were resected, assessed, and histologically evaluated as 
previously described59. Each sample was pathologically graded using established criteria for 
tumors generated in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM)75. Grade 1 PNSTs are 
called neurofibromas. Tumors with features of human MPNSTs (GEMM grade 3 PNSTs) 
are called grade 3 PNSTs.

Transposon Insertion Site Analysis

DNA isolated from SB-derived neurofibromas and grade 3 PNSTs underwent linker-
mediated PCR to amplify transposon-genomic DNA junctions and were sequenced as 
previously described34. Identification of TAPDANCE CISs and gene centric CISs from 
sequenced transposon-genomic DNA PCR products was performed as previously 
described49,50. The local-hopping phenomenon of T2/Onc was accounted for by excluding 
chromosome 15 (T2/Onc donor locus) from the analysis. Known CIS artifacts originating 
from the T2/Onc sequence elements (En2, Foxf2) and amplified regions of the mouse 
genome (Serinc3, Sfi) were also excluded48,49. Thirty-three histologically normal nerves 
from SB mutagenized mice were sequenced to assess potential transposon integration 
hotspots; no CISs were identified.

Gene expression data analysis

Published data (GEO accession #:GSE14038, Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0) were 
used for gene expression pattern analysis. For gene annotation, custom CDF (custom 
GeneChip library file) based on RefSeq target definitions (Hs133P REFSEQ Version 8) was 
downloaded and used to provide accurate interpretation of GeneChip data76.

Statistical comparisons were done using R/Bioconductor packages and GeneSpring GX 
v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed (DE)-genes were defined as genes 
with expression levels at least three-fold higher or lower in target groups (MPNST) 
compared to normal human Schwann cells (NHSCs) after applying Benjamini and Hochberg 
false discovery rate correction (FDR/BH p ≤ 0.05)77.

MPNST whole-methylome data analysis

Feber et al. published unbiased whole-methylome data of NHSCs, neurofibroma, and 
MPNST genomes (GEO accession #: GSE21714)53. We adopted the Feber et al. method for 
detecting differentially methylated regions (DMR) in MPNST compared to NHSC53,78. 
Briefly, Batman methylation scores per 100bp were averaged for each 1Kb window. A 
conservative threshold for DMR calling was used based on the 95th percentile of the 
difference in methylation score. DMR regions were mapped to human genome hg18 version 
(Build NCBI-36).

The nearest CpG island shores (CpG-IS) to the transcription start sites (TSS) of each gene/
miRNA were scanned53,78. We defined CpG-IS as areas up to 2Kb distant from CpG 
islands. We considered the nearest upstream CpG-IS from the transcription start site, within

5K bp ranges from each TSS. The genomic coordinates of miRNAs, genes, and CpG islands 
(NCBI36/hg18) were extracted from corresponding tracks of UCSC Genome Browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). For intragenic miRNAs, we assumed their expression is 
influenced by the nearest CpG-IS to the TSS of their host gene.

Copy number alteration (CNA) data analysis

CNA data on 51 primary MPNSTs were from the published GSE3388 data set (Agilent 
Human Genome CGH Microarray kit (4x44K)54,79. A circular binary segmentation (CBS) 
algorithm was applied to the log2 ratios of intensity values from tumor and normal to reduce 
local noise effects. CBS calculates a likelihood-ratio statistic for each array probe by 
permutation to locate change-points80. After segmentation step, CGHcall algorithm was 
used to assign each segment an aberration label: gain, loss, or normal81. A visualization 
program was written in R to present overall gain/loss patterns of all 51 MPNSTs. We 
considered a given genomic region as significantly recurrent CNA region if the number of 
CNA labels (gain or loss) given to them exceeded a threshold of statistical significance that 
we estimated using a permutation test. Briefly, CNA labels, three state calls (gain/loss/
normal) by CGHcall algorithm, of the targets were permuted 10,000 times to get 
distribution, and sums of gain or loss labels were computed for each target. The 95th 
percentile values for both sums (23 patients out of 51) were chosen as thresholds of 
statistically significant recurrent CNA. Genomic coordinates used in plots were based on 
hg19/GRCh37.p8 (R/Bioconductor biomaRt package)82.

SNP-Array Analysis

SNP-array analysis was performed on 14 MPNST primary tumors using the Illumina 
Infinium technology (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Tumors were analyzed using the Illumina 
Human660W-Quad beadchip. The data were processed with GenoCNA to segment the 
genome and determine copy number status82.

Tissue Microarray

Representative areas of disease were identified on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections 
for 30 dermal neurofibromas, 31 plexiform neurofibromas, and 32 MPNSTs. Blocks 
consisting of duplicate 1.0 mm core samples were constructed with a manual tissue arrayer 
(MTA-1, Beecher Inc, WI) with 64 cores per recipient block. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
for FOXR2 (1:100, SIGMA) was performed utilizing an immunohistochemical staining 
platform (Nemesis 7200, Biocare) following standard IHC protocols83. Digital images of 
IHC stained TMA slides were obtained as previously described by Rizzardi et al. 201284.

Cell Culture/Assays

Immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSCs) were acquired from the laboratory of Dr. 
Margaret Wallace. iHSCs and human MPNST cell lines (ST88-14, STS26T, S462, S462-
TY, and T265) were cultured in complete media (1xDMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x 
penicillin/streptomycin) and grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. shRNA GIPZ lentiviral constructs 
were purchased from Openbiosystems. Proliferation assays were setup in a 96-well plate 
format with 500 cells per well in full DMEM media containing 1ug/ml of puromycin (Life

Technologies). Proliferation was assessed every 24 hours for 5 days using the MTS assay 
(Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Experiments were performed in 
triplicate. Soft agar anchorage independent colony formation assays were carried out as 
previously described85. After 2 weeks of growth, cells were fixed in 10% formalin 
containing 0.005% Crystal Violet for 1 hour at room temperature. Formalin was removed 
and colonies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope. Twelve images per cell line were 
taken and automated colony counts were done using ImageJ software.

FOXR2 overexpression construct

FOXR2 cDNA (Open Biosystems) was cloned into the Gateway Vector System (Invitrogen) 
and subcloned into a piggyBac (PB) transposon vector. The PB control vector contains the 
Luciferase and Gfp reporter genes. Cells were transfected with 2ug of FOXR2 or Luciferase 
PB transposon (Supplementary Fig. 8a) and 500ng of PB7 transposase plasmid using the 
NEON transfection system following manufacturers protocols (Invitrogen). Successfully 
transfected cells were enriched with 1ug/ml puromycin.

Generation of TALEN Knockout Cell Lines

TALENs targeting FOXR2 were designed using TALE-NT and constructed as previously 
described86–88. An HPRT TALEN pair served as a control86. TALENs were assembled 
using Golden Gate cloning with the truncated Δ152+63 TALEN backbone 86,89. Assembled 
TALENs were tested by transient transfection into K562 cells using the NEON 
electroporation system (Invitrogen) and subsequent CEL-I assay90.

Knockout cell lines were generated using the PB Co-transposition method (Moriarity et al., 
unpublished data). Briefly, cells were electroporated with plasmids encoding the left and 
right TALENs, the hyperactive PB7 transposase, and Puromycin encoding transposon 
vectors. TALEN-treated cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 day followed by two 
days of ‘cold shock’ at 30°C to increase nuclease activity91. Cells were seeded at 50 cells 
per well in 96 well plates with Puromycin containing DMEM. Single cell clones were 
expanded, DNA was extracted, and CEL-I PCR was performed with amplicons sequenced 
via standard single pass Sanger sequencing (ACGT, Inc). Individual clone sequence data 
were analyzed for insertion/deletions (indels) formed by non-homologous end joining at the 
TALEN cut site and were classified as wildtype (WT), knockout (KO), or mutation detected 
(MD). Mutation detected clones were further analyzed by standard TOPO cloning and 
sequencing to determine the indels at each allele.

Quantitative-PCR analysis

1ug of total RNA was DNase (Life Technologies) treated and used for reverse transcription 
with the Super Script III first strand synthesis kit (Life Technologies) following 
manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR reactions utilized the LightCycler 480 SYBR I Green 
(Roche) and were analyzed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep gradient S. Primers are listed 
in Supplementary Table 12. Data were analyzed using the RealPlex software, calibrated to 
ACTB levels, and normalized to respective controls.

Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence

FOXR2 protein was detected in whole cell lysates harvested with modified RIPA buffer 
(0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing 
phosphatase inhibitors (SIGMA) and a complete mini protease inhibitor pellet (Roche). 
Lysates were separated on a 10% resolving gel, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed 
with antibodies against FOXR2 (SIGMA) and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Tech.) following 
manufacturers’ protocols. Immunofluorescence on tissue sections and cell lines with 
antibodies probing FOXR2 (SIGMA) and CNPase (Santa Cruz) were carried out following 
manufacturers’ protocols followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary 
antibodies (Life Technologies). Slides were counter stained and mounted with anti-FADE 
Gold (Life Technologies) containing DAPI. Images were acquired using AxioVision 
software.

The y-axis displays the methylation state (negative number indicating hypomethylation and 
positive number indicating hypermethylation) of each gene’s CpG-IS nearest to the 
transcriptional start site (TSS) in MPNSTs versus NHSCs (methylation analysis described in 
detail in online methods and Supp Table 5). The x-axis depicts the CNA observed in 
MPNSTs versus NHSCs (determination of CNA is described in online methods and Supp 
Table 3). Numbers reflect the percentage of the 51 patient samples that have a CNA. 
Negative numbers indicated CNA loss while positive numbers indicate CNA gains. The

yellow shaded area indicates the 95th percentile for significant recurrent CNAs. Microarray 
expression was represented by size from 1X-10X (determination of expression changes are 
described in online methods and Supp Fig 8) and color to depict genes that are upregulated 
in red (a), downregulated in blue (b), or have no change or have no probes on the microarray 
in gray (c) in gene expression comparing MPNSTs to NHSCs. For recurrent CNAs, we 
considered a gene that shows the gain (or loss) pattern if the ratio of gain (or loss) out of all 
51 patients is more than 1.5X that of the ratio of loss (or gain). Significant recurrent CNAs 
must be observed in 23/51 patient samples (95th percentile).

Figure 3. CIS analysis for cooperating genes and pathways for grade 3 PNST formation
(a) Venn diagram depicting the clustering of the 87 grade 3 PNST CISs into three cancer-
associated signaling pathways: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK/p38, Wnt/CTNNB1. Values 
indicate the percentage of the 87 CISs contributing to each pathway. CISs were classified 
into each pathway based on IPA, DAVID, GENECARD, and PUBMED analysis and 
literature review to identify canonical members and pathway effectors. (b) This module of 
genes depicts co-occurrence analysis of grade 3 PNST td-CISs. p-values for CIS interactions 
are listed in Supplementary Table 10.

Figure 4. Loss of Nf1 and Pten cooperate to form high-grade PNSTs
(a) Co-occurrence analysis heat map depicting each mouse tumor (neurofibromas left, grade 
3 PNST right) and the presence of an insertion into either the Pten or the Nf1 locus (red 
bars). Tumors from 13/62 mice (106 grade 3 PNSTS) contained insertions in both Nf1 and 
Pten, which is statistically significantly different from the neurofibroma profile of 1/55 mice 
(269 neurofibromas) (FET p<7.94x10−05). (b) Survival curve of three genetic cohorts: Cnp-
Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+(n=5), Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f (n=5), Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+(n=15). Statistical analysis 
of curves: Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ vs Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f p<0.05; Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+ vs 
Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+p<0.0001; Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f vs Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+p=0.0018. p-values reflect 
Logrank test. (c) Necropsy images from a 275 day old Cnp-Cre; Ptenf/+mouse, a 175 day 
old Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f mouse, and a 120 day old Cnp-Cre; Nf1f/f; Ptenf/+mouse. (d) 
Histological analysis of sciatic nerve tumor in (c). H&E staining depicts high cellularity 
with few mitotic figures corroborated with Ki67 IHC. Toluidine blue stain depicts presence 
of Mast cells indicative of nerve origin. S100 positive staining depicts presence of Schwann 
cells. This tumor contained regions of high-grade PNST formation.

Figure 5. T2/Onc insertions in the Foxr2 locus cause overexpression of Foxr2 in SB-derived 
grade 3 PNSTs
(a) Schematic depicting the mouse Foxr2 locus. The MSCV promoter of T2/Onc for all 
transposon insertions faces the same orientation as Foxr2 transcription (arrows). Annotated 
exons are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4. * represents the translational start site. The exon 2′ is a 
putative unannotated exon. (b) RT-PCR on cDNA from SB-derived grade 3 PNSTs. Bands 
indicate mRNA fusions between T2/Onc and Foxr2. Lane 1 is an SB-derived grade 3 PNST 
that did not contain a Foxr2 insertion. Lanes 2 and 4 are T2/Onc insertions upstream of exon 
1. Lane 3 is the T2/Onc insertion immediately upstream of exon 2′. The schematics are the 
sequenced splicing events from each of the excised products. The superscript 2′ represents 
splicing into the putative 2′ exon. (c) Quantitative PCR for Foxr2 expression in SB-derived 
grade 3 PNSTs with and without a T2/Onc insertion in Foxr2. ** p<0.001 based on two-
tailed student t-test. (d) Immunofluorescent staining for Foxr2 (green), Cnp (red), and Dapi 
(blue) on tumor sections containing (right) and not containing (left) a T2/Onc insertion in 
Foxr2. (e) Western blot analysis for Foxr2 expression from two SB-derived tumor cell lines 
containing (right) and not containing (left) a T2/Onc insertion into Foxr2.

Figure 6. Increased FOXR2 expression is associated with human MPNSTs
(a) Immunohistochemical staining for FOXR2 of a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 27 
dermal neurofibroma samples (dNF), 26 plexiform neurofibroma samples (pNF), and 31 
MPNST samples. Representative images for FOXR2 staining for each tumor type are 
shown. (b) Bar graph depicts percentages for either staining localization for each tumor type 
(nuclear, cytoplasmic, both, or negative). (c) The bar graph depicts quantitative PCR 
analysis for FOXR2 expression in iHSCs (HSC1λ and HSC2λ) and MPNST (T265, ST8814, 
STS26T, S462, S462-TY) cell lines. Data are normalized to purified normal human 
Schwann cells (NHSCs). The lower bands indicate western blot analysis for FOXR2 for the 
same cell lines. (d) Immunofluorescent imaging of FOXR2 expression in HSC2λ, STS26T, 
and S462-TY. Staining is predominantly cytoplasmic as observed in the MPNST samples in 
(a).

cells were injected into Nu/Nu mice. Tumors were measured over a 1 month period. 
Wildtype STS26T tumors grew significantly larger than paired KO (two-tailed student t-test 
***p=0.0009). Images were captured at time of necropsy of the tumors from WT (n=5, left) 
or regions were injections occurred (n=5, right). H&E staining of tissue sections from the 
masses indicate the wildtype masses were tumors while the masses from the KO cells were 
predominantly fat pad tissue that contained the injected cells.
