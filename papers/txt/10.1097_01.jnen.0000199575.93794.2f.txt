Abstract

Sporadic and neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 2-associated schwannomas
contain a glial growth factor (GGF)-like activity that has been hy-
pothesized to promote neoplastic Schwann cell mitogenesis. It is not
known whether this GGF-like activity is neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), an
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related molecule that regulates the
proliferation, survival, and differentiation of developing Schwann
cells, the related factor NRG-2, or another NRG/EGF ligand. We
report
that neoplastic Schwann cells within schwannomas over-
express multiple a and b transmembrane precursors from the class II
and class III NRG-1 subfamilies. NRG-2 a and b transcripts are
similarly overexpressed in some tumors. Of the other 8 known NRG/
EGF ligands, only heparin-binding EGF, epiregulin, and TGFa are
detectable in schwannomas. Neoplastic Schwann cells almost uni-
formly express erbB2 and erbB3, 2 membrane receptor tyrosine
kinases mediating NRG-1 and NRG-2 action. Expression of the NRG
receptor erbB4 and EGF receptor is also evident in schwannomas, but
is more limited, occurring in only a subset of these tumors. ErbB2, the
preferred dimerization partner for all erbB kinases, is constitutively
phosphorylated in schwannomas. These observations suggest that
autocrine, paracrine, and/or
juxtacrine NRG-1/NRG-2 signaling
promotes schwannoma pathogenesis and that this signaling pathway
may be an important therapeutic target in schwannomas.

INTRODUCTION

Schwannomas, the third most common type of primary
nervous system neoplasm, are derived from Schwann cells, the
myelinating glia of peripheral nerves. These benign peripheral
nerve sheath tumors arise most frequently from sensory

nerves, with common sites of occurrence including nerves in
the head and neck region, cranial and spinal nerve roots, and
nerves along the extensor surfaces of the extremities (1).
Schwannomas typically occur as single lesions in otherwise
normal patients. However, individuals with the autosomal-
dominant tumor susceptibility syndrome neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis
type 2 (NF2) characteristically develop bilateral vestibular
nerve (acoustic) schwannomas and multiple schwannomas of
spinal dorsal nerve roots (2, 3). Multiple subcutaneous and
spinal root schwannomas are also a feature of schwannoma-
tosis, a rare genetic disorder distinct from NF2 (4). Sporadic,
NF2-, and schwannomatosis-associated schwannomas fre-
quently occur in conÔ¨Åned spaces within the cranium and spinal
column, where their impingement on nerves and the central
neuraxis results in considerable patient morbidity. Surgical
resection is the standard approach to treating these tumors but
can be rendered difÔ¨Åcult by tumor size, multiplicity, or
location. The alternative is radiotherapy or radiosurgery, both
of which have shown limited success, particularly when
treating larger neoplasms (5). Given these limitations, there is
considerable interest in deÔ¨Åning the molecular abnormalities
promoting schwannoma tumorigenesis and using this in-
formation to develop new, more effective treatments for these
tumors.

alterations

The genetic

involved in schwannoma
pathogenesis are poorly understood. It is known that patients
with NF2 carry a germline mutation in the NF2 tumor-
suppressor gene on chromosome 22q12 and, in keeping with
the proposed function of this gene, develop schwannomas
when the remaining functional copy of the NF2 gene is lost (6,
7). Both sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas demon-
strate a near-universal loss of expression of merlin (8‚Äì10), the
product of the NF2 locus. Merlin (also known as schwanno-
min) is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin)
proteins and has been found to modulate cell motility and to
suppress mitogenesis (3). Based on these actions, it is thought
that a loss of merlin expression in Schwann cells leads to
inappropriate Schwann cell growth and the formation of
schwannomas. Other genetic abnormalities such as chromo-
some 1p loss (11) and 9q34 gain (12) have also been identiÔ¨Åed
in small subsets of schwannomas, but the essential genes
within these regions remain to be deÔ¨Åned.

Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors
may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic and NF2-
associated schwannomas. In 1986, Brockes et al reported that

ErbB Ligand Overexpression in Schwannomas

extracts from 3 NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas and
5 of 7 sporadic vestibular schwannomas contained a Schwann
cell growth-promoting activity similar to that present in par-
tially puriÔ¨Åed preparations of bovine pituitary glial growth
factor (GGF) (13). Pituitary GGF was subsequently puriÔ¨Åed
and cloned, leading to the Ô¨Ånding that pituitary-derived GGF
proteins were members of the neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) family of
growth factors, a group of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-
related molecules that act through erbB membrane tyrosine
kinases to stimulate the proliferation, survival, and migration
of Schwann cells during development (14‚Äì16). The GGF-like
activity present in schwannomas, however, has never been
deÔ¨Ånitively identiÔ¨Åed. Although it is tempting to assume that
this activity similarly represents NRG-1 proteins, other NRG-
related molecules, including NRG-2, NRG-3, and NRG-4,
have recently been identiÔ¨Åed. Some of these molecules have
biochemical and functional characteristics similar to NRG-1,
raising the question of whether the GGF-like activity in
schwannomas instead corresponds to one of these other growth
factors. As an initial step toward deÔ¨Åning the GGF-like activity
present in schwannomas, we have systematically analyzed the
expression of speciÔ¨Åc isoforms of NRG-1 and NRG-2 and of
all the other known NRG and EGF family growth factors in
human schwannomas. Because each erbB kinase differs in its
afÔ¨Ånity for these ligands, we have also examined the expres-
sion of all 4 erbB receptors in schwannomas and ascertained
whether there is evidence of constitutive erbB activation in
these tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Cases

Experiments described in this article were approved by
the Institutional Review Boards for Human Use of
the
University of Alabama at Birmingham and Washington
University School of Medicine. ParafÔ¨Ån blocks of human
schwannoma cases were obtained from the Ô¨Åles of
the
Departments of Pathology of Washington University School of
Medicine (St. Louis, MO) and the University of Alabama
School of Medicine (Birmingham, AL). Frozen, surgically re-
sected schwannoma tissue was provided by the Southern
Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network/University
of Alabama at Birmingham Tumor Bank and the University of
Alabama Brain Tumor Bank.

Antisera and Immunohistochemical Reagents

We have previously described the production and char-
acterization of a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the
EGF-like common domain found in all biologically active
NRG-1 isoforms (a ‚Äò‚Äòpan NRG-1‚Äô‚Äô antibody) (17). A mouse
monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in the EGF
receptor (EGFR; residues 996‚Äì1002) was obtained from MP
Biomedicals (clone c11; Irvine, CA). A mouse monoclonal
anti-erbB2 antibody directed toward the C-terminus of human
c-neu (residues 1242‚Äì1255) was purchased from Oncogene
Research Products (Ab-3; La Jolla, CA). The mouse IgM
monoclonal antibody RTJ.1 recognizes the C-terminal domain
of erbB3; this antibody and an isotype matched negative con-
trol clone (C48-6) was obtained from BD Biosciences

PharMingen (San Diego, CA). AfÔ¨Ånity puriÔ¨Åed rabbit poly-
clonal antisera for EGFR (sc-03), erbB3 (sc-285), erbB4 (sc-
283), and the NRG-1 ‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô-carboxy terminal domain (sc-348)
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing erbB2
phosphorylated on Tyr1248 (clone PN2A) was purchased from
Lab Vision Corporation (Fremont CA). A rabbit anti-S100b
polyclonal antibody (antibody Z0311) was obtained from
DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark) and a mouse anti-S100b mono-
clonal antibody (clone 15E2-E2-A1) was purchased from
Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Nonimmune mouse and rabbit
IgGs were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey antirabbit and donkey
antimouse secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno-
Research Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Tyramide signal
ampliÔ¨Åcation reagents,
including streptavidin‚Äìhorseradish
peroxidase, biotinyl
tyramide, ampliÔ¨Åcation diluent, and
blocking reagent, were purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life and
Analytical Science Products (Renaissance TSA-Indirect kit;
Boston, MA). DAB peroxidase substrate (SK-4100) was ob-
tained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA).

Immunoblotting

reagent

in TRIzol

Lysates for immunoblotting were prepared by homog-
enizing specimens
(Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs
protocol. Protein pellets were dissolved in 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) supplemented with protease (Sigma #P8340)
and phosphatase (Sigma #P5726) inhibitors diluted 1:100‚Äì
1:250. Protein concentrations were determined with a modiÔ¨Åed
Lowry method (DC Protein Assay; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA),
and equivalent quantities of protein lysates were resolved
using 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred
to PVDF membranes by electroblotting for 180 minutes at
0.5 A in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 8.3], 0.192 M gly-
cine, 20% methanol). NonspeciÔ¨Åc binding was blocked by
incubating membranes in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.15
M NaCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.05% Tween-20) before
incubation with primary antibody. The following primary
antibody concentrations were used for immunoblotting: pan
NRG-1 (1:5000), EGFR (sc-03; 1:1000), erbB2 (Oncogene
Ab-3; 1:500), erbB3 (sc-285; 1:1000), and erbB4 (sc-283;
1:1000). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey antirabbit
and donkey antimouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Im-
munoresearch Laboratories) were used at a 1:10000 dilution in
5% nonfat dry milk/TBST. Immunoreactive species were de-
tected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

Schwannomas commonly show highly variable degrees
of collagenization. This variability can markedly alter the
relative contribution intracellular and extracellular proteins
make to the Ô¨Ånal protein composition of tumor lysates. In
keeping with this, our preliminary experiments demonstrated
that using GAPDH, b-actin, or ERK-2 immunoreactivity as
a loading control for schwannoma lysates was problematic.
Consequently, we veriÔ¨Åed equivalent loading and transfer by
Coomassie staining PVDF membranes posttransfer. SpeciÔ¨Åc-
ity of immunoblotting was determined in parallel experiments
in which primary antibodies were preincubated with a 5- to

10-fold excess of the appropriate immunizing peptide before
probing blots.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry for NRG-1 and its erbB recep-
tors was performed using a highly sensitive staining protocol
we have previously developed and validated (18). In brief,
after deparafÔ¨Ånization of 4- to 5-mm sections in xylenes and
graded alcohols, antigen rescue was performed by gently
boiling slides in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 minutes
and then allowing them to cool
to room temperature for
15 minutes. NonspeciÔ¨Åc binding was blocked by incubating
sections for 15 minutes with TNB blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris-
HCl [pH 7.5]/0.15 M NaCl/0.5% blocking reagent [Perkin-
Elmer]) at room temperature. Sections were then incubated
overnight at 4¬∞C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking
buffer (pan NRG-1, 1:250-1:500; EGFR [clone c11], 1:100;
erbB2 [Oncogene Ab-3], 1:100; erbB3 [clone RTJ.1], 1:100;
erbB4 [sc-283], 1:500; and phosphorylated erbB2 [clone
PN2A], 1:500). Adjacent sections of each tumor were stained
with anti-S100b antibody as a positive control. After 3 rinses
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 minutes per rinse),
sections were incubated for one hour at room temperature with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (di-
luted 1:500 in blocking buffer). After 3 washes in PBS,
biotinyl tyramide (diluted 1:50 in ampliÔ¨Åcation diluent) was
applied to tissue sections for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Sections were again washed 3 times in PBS, following which
they were incubated with streptavidin-HRP (diluted 1:100 in
TNB) for 45 minutes. After 3 Ô¨Ånal washes with PBS, immu-
noreactive structures were visualized by diaminobenzidine
deposition. To conÔ¨Årm the speciÔ¨Åcity of staining, control sec-
tions were incubated with nonimmune rabbit or mouse
immunoglobulin in place of the primary antibodies; no stain-
ing was observed in these experiments. When the immunizing
peptide was available, the speciÔ¨Åcity of staining was further
conÔ¨Årmed by preincubating antisera with either the immuni-
zing peptide or a nonrelated peptide (10 ng/mL);
in all
instances, preincubation with the immunizing peptide, but not
the nonrelated peptide, abolished or markedly reduced the
staining pattern observed with primary antibody alone.

For double-label immunohistochemistry, sections were
processed as described and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal
antibody recognizing the subset of NRG-1 transmembrane
precursors with an ‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô variant carboxy terminus (antibody sc-
348; 1:500 dilution) and a mouse anti-S100b monoclonal
antibody (1:100 dilution). NRG-1-immunoreactive structures
were labeled as described except
that Cy3-conjugated
streptavidin was used for detection rather than streptavidin-
HRP. Sections were then incubated with a FITC-conjugated
antimouse secondary antibody to label S100b-immunoreac-
tive cells. After 3 PBS rinses, sections were mounted using 1:1
PBS:glycerol and examined by Ô¨Çuorescence microscopy.

Reverse Transcriptase‚ÄìPolymerase Chain
Reaction Analyses of NRG-1 Isoforms Expressed
in Schwannoma Biopsy Specimens

Our designation of NRG-1 domains follows the nomen-
clature of Peles and Yarden (19). The common forward

164

oligonucleotide used for ampliÔ¨Åcation of sequences encoding
the EGF-like and juxtamembrane domains of NRG-1
corresponds to nucleotides 631‚Äì648 of human neu differen-
tiation factor (NDF; GenBank accession no. U02326) (20).
The reverse oligonucleotide used for PCR of NRG-1 trans-
membrane precursor cDNAs represents nucleotides 811‚Äì828
(encoding a portion of the transmembrane domain sequence)
of human NDF. This oligonucleotide pair will amplify se-
quences encoding all possible combinations of EGF-like and
juxtamembrane sequences found in NRG-1 transmembrane
isoform mRNAs. Secreted NRG-1 isoform cDNAs were
ampliÔ¨Åed using a reverse oligonucleotide corresponding to
nucleotides 482‚Äì502 of a human NDFb3 splice variant
(GenBank accession no. U02327) (20) in combination with
the common forward oligonucleotide.

Total RNA was isolated from schwannomas using
TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer‚Äôs recommenda-
tions. Single-stranded cDNA for use as a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) template was reverse transcribed from total
cellular RNA in a 20-mL reaction containing random hexamer
primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse tran-
scriptase (RT) (Superscript Plus; Life Technologies, Gaithers-
burg, MD). After completion of reactions, samples were
diluted to 100 mL with distilled water, boiled for 5 minutes,
and stored at ‚Äì80¬∞C until use.

Two microliters of each cDNA was used as a PCR
template in reactions performed for 35 cycles of 94¬∞C for one
minute, 55¬∞C for one minute, and 72¬∞C for 2 minutes. PCR
products were ligated to pCR4-TOPO and ligations trans-
formed into Escherichia coli (TOP10 strain) as recommended
by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The sequence of these clones
was determined by cycle sequencing using an automated
sequencer (ABI Model 373A DNA Sequencing System;
Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA).

Real-Time Quantitative Reverse
Transcriptase‚ÄìPolymerase Chain Reaction

One microgram of total RNA isolated from normal
nerve or schwannomas as described was reverse-transcribed in
a 20-mL reaction containing random hexamer primers and
Moloney murine leukemia virus RT; a parallel reaction, per-
formed identically except for the addition of RT, was used to
verify an absence of genomic DNA contamination. After
completion of RT, samples were diluted to 100 mL with
distilled water, boiled for 5 minutes, and stored at ‚Äì80¬∞C until
used in real-time PCR experiments.

Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an
ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).
Assays for NRG-1, NRG-2, and erbB cDNA levels were
performed using TaqMan MGB probes labeled with FAM dye
(ABI Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression assays) in a 20-mL
reaction containing 2 mL of cDNA, ROX passive reference
dye, and TaqMan Universal PCR mix (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.); this reaction mix was supplemented with uracil N-
glycosylase to minimize the possibility that spurious results
could be produced by carryover of contaminating PCR
products. The speciÔ¨Åc primer sets used and the regions hy-
bridizing to the FAM-labeled probes are as follows:

RESULTS

Human Schwannomas Express Multiple
NRG-1-Immunoreactive Proteins

At least 15 structurally distinct NRG-1 proteins are
produced from a single gene through a combination of
alternative mRNA splicing and alternative promoter use (21).
All of these proteins contain an EGF-like domain that directly
binds to and activates NRG-1 receptors (22). We therefore
focused initially on determining whether the NRG-1 EGF-like
domain was detectable in human schwannomas. Lysates
prepared from 6 surgically resected human schwannomas
(Table 1) were immunoblotted and probed using a ‚Äò‚Äòpan NRG-
1‚Äô‚Äô antibody that recognizes the amino terminal (common)
portion of the NRG-1 EGF-like domain. Multiple NRG-1-
immunoreactive species were detectable in all 6 schwannomas
with sizes ranging from 150 to 58 kD (Fig. 1A). The masses of
the larger (150 and 120 kD) NRG-1 proteins labeled by this
antibody were similar to those of the NRG-1 isoforms we have
previously detected in brain and spinal cord lysates (17) and
likely represent NRG-1 transmembrane precursor proteins. The
other NRG-1-immunoreactive species detectable in schwan-
nomas (90, 65, 60, and 58 kD polypeptides) were too small to
be transmembrane precursors and had masses consistent with
either directly secreted NRG-1 isoforms or extracellular do-
main sequences released by proteolytic cleavage of NRG-1
transmembrane precursors (17, 21, 23). Comparing the NRG-
1 proteins detected in schwannomas with those evident in
normal eighth cranial nerve, we found that the most prominent
(58 kD) NRG-1 protein in normal nerve comigrated with

a protein present in the majority of the schwannomas tested.
However, schwannomas also consistently demonstrated prom-
inent expression of several higher-molecular-weight NRG-1
isoforms that were detectable in normal nerve only with long
exposures, suggesting that
the tumors expressed distinct
proÔ¨Åles of NRG-1 isoforms. In both schwannomas and eighth
cranial nerve, labeling of NRG-1-immunoreactive proteins
was abolished or markedly diminished by preincubating the
primary antibody with immunizing peptide (data not shown).
To further establish the identity of the proteins labeled
by the pan NRG-1 antibody, schwannoma lysates were probed
with an antibody that recognizes an epitope within the carboxy
terminus of a major subset of NRG-1 isoforms (trans-
membrane precursors with an ‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô variant carboxy terminus).
This antibody labeled several proteins in schwannomas that
ranged in size from 55 to 150 kD (Fig. 1B). The larger
polypeptides detected by the ‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô carboxy terminus antibody
(150 and 120 kD) comigrate with the larger species labeled by
the pan NRG-1 antibody, consistent with the notion that these
molecules are NRG-1 transmembrane precursors. The anti-
NRG-1 ‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô carboxy terminus antibody also labeled several
smaller proteins in the eighth cranial nerve and in a subset of
schwannomas. These smaller (80, 70, 65, and 55 kD) proteins
are too small to be full-length NRG-1 transmembrane pre-
cursor proteins and likely represent proteolytic cleavage prod-
ucts of NRG-1 transmembrane precursors. Labeling of all of
the polypeptides detected by the anti-‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô carboxy terminus
antibody in schwannomas and the eighth cranial nerve was
abolished or markedly diminished by preincubating the pri-
mary antibody with immunizing peptide (data not shown).
Considered together,
these Ô¨Åndings indicate that multiple
NRG-1 proteins are present in schwannomas, at least some of
which are NRG-1 transmembrane precursors.

NRG-1 protein in schwannomas could be primarily
associated with neoplastic Schwann cells or alternatively be
derived from nonneoplastic elements within the tumors (e.g.
vasculature or cells in the tumor capsule). To establish the

diminished when the primary antibody was preincubated with
the immunizing peptide before staining tumor sections.

To determine whether NRG-1 immunoreactivity was
associated with neoplastic Schwann cells in schwannomas,
double-label immunohistochemistry was performed using the
anti-‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô carboxy terminus rabbit polyclonal antibody in
combination with a mouse anti-S100b monoclonal antibody.
Immunoreactivity for this subset of NRG-1 proteins was
evident as punctuate staining scattered diffusely throughout
schwannomas (Fig. 2D). A comparison of the distribution of
NRG-1 and S100b immunoreactivity showed that
these
antigens extensively colocalized within the tumors (Fig. 2E,
F). Because the epitope recognized by the anti-‚Äò‚Äòa‚Äô‚Äô carboxy
terminus antibody is not thought to be released from cells
synthesizing NRG-1 transmembrane precursors, these Ô¨Åndings
also suggest that neoplastic Schwann cells within schwanno-
mas are the source of at least a portion of the NRG-1 protein
detectable in these peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Schwannomas Overexpress a Complex Mixture
of a and b Transmembrane Precursors From the
Class II and Class III NRG-1 Subfamilies

The presence of multiple, variably sized NRG-1 proteins
in schwannomas suggested that these tumors express several
structurally and functionally distinct NRG-1 isoforms. Structural
variation in the NRG-1 EGF-like domain and adjacent regions
has particularly important functional implications. The NRG-1
EGF-like domain is composed of an invariant amino terminal
(common) domain that can be fused to either an a or a b
domain (Fig. 3), resulting in the production of isoforms that
differ in their afÔ¨Ånity for the NRG-1 receptors and in their
ability to elicit at least some responses such as mitogenesis
(21). A structurally variable juxtamembrane domain is found
immediately carboxy terminal to the EGF-like domain; one
variant of this domain (‚Äò‚Äò3‚Äô‚Äô isoforms) contains a termination
codon and thus allows the protein to be directly secreted,

(24), raising the question of whether much of the NRG-1
protein we detected in the eighth cranial nerve was axon-
derived. Because mRNAs are largely excluded from axons,
measurements of NRG-1 mRNA levels are likely to produce
a more accurate comparison of the levels of NRG-1 expression
per cell in normal and neoplastic Schwann cells. We therefore
compared the levels of NRG-1 a and b transcripts in normal
nerves and schwannomas arising from these same nerves.
Performing real-time quantitative PCR with TaqMan primers
speciÔ¨Åc for NRG-1a or NRG-1b cDNAs and normalizing the
resulting data to the levels of 18S ribosomal RNA present in
the same cDNAs, we found that both types of transcripts were
detectable in the normal eighth cranial nerve and spinal nerve
root. The expression of NRG-1a mRNA was elevated in 4 of
the 5 schwannomas (Fig. 4A), being found at levels ranging
from 1.6 to over 4,000 times greater than that found in normal
nerve. NRG-1b mRNA expression was increased in all 5 of the
schwannomas we tested (Fig. 4B), with levels varying from
4.3- to 312-fold greater than those present in normal nerve.
Three major NRG-1 subfamilies (class I [neu differen-
tiation factor (NDF)], class II [GGF], and class III [sensory and
motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF)/cysteine-rich domain]
isoforms) have been identiÔ¨Åed, each of which is characterized
by subfamily-speciÔ¨Åc amino terminal sequences with distinct
functional characteristics. To determine which of these 3
subfamilies are expressed in schwannomas, we performed RT-
PCR analyses using primers speciÔ¨Åc for the amino terminal
sequences of each subfamily. We found that class II and class
III transcripts were readily detected in schwannomas, whereas
class I mRNA expression was not evident in these tumors (data
not shown). To compare the relative levels of expression of the
major NRG-1 subfamilies in schwannomas with that in normal
eighth cranial nerve, we performed real-time quantitative PCR
using TaqMan primers speciÔ¨Åc for the immunoglobulin-like
(Ig-like) domain present in class II isoforms or primers speciÔ¨Åc
for the class III amino terminal domain. Again, we found that
both primer sets detected these mRNAs in normal nerve. The
expression of class II NRG-1 mRNA was consistently
increased in the 5 schwannomas we examined (Fig. 4C),
with levels ranging from 1.3- to 137-fold greater than that
found in normal nerve. Class III NRG-1 transcript levels were
likewise elevated in 4 schwannomas (Fig. 4D), with levels 3.2-
to 1430-fold higher than the levels detected in normal nerve.
We conclude that human schwannomas overexpress a complex
mixture of NRG-1 mRNAs encoding a and b transmembrane
precursors from the class II and III subfamilies.

A Subset of Schwannomas Overexpress
NRG-2 a and b Isoforms

Neuregulin-2 (NRG-2 [25, 26]; also known as Don-1
[27] and neural- and thymus-derived activator for erbB kinases
(NTAK [28]) is a NRG-1-related growth factor represented by
6 alternatively spliced isoforms derived from a single gene.
NRG-2 is heparin-binding (28) and stimulates phosphoryla-
tion of the NRG-1 receptor subunits erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4
(25‚Äì28). Because these features are shared with the GGF-like
activity previously identiÔ¨Åed in human schwannomas (13), we
examined the potential expression of NRG-2 transcripts in the

whereas the other 3 (1, 2, or 4 variants) are fused to membrane-
spanning sequences in NRG-1 transmembrane precursors
(Fig. 3). To determine whether the NRG-1 isoforms expressed
in human schwannomas demonstrated structural variability in
these regions, we used RT-PCR to amplify sequences encoding
the EGF-like common, EGF-like variant, juxtamembrane, and
transmembrane domains of NRG-1 transmembrane precur-
sors. Using RNA isolated from 5 of the same tumors used for
our
these NRG-1
sequences were uniformly detectable in all 5 schwannomas
(data not shown). To further examine the structure of these
NRG-1 transmembrane precursor mRNAs, we cloned the PCR
products derived from 2 tumors and sequenced 21 independent
subclones. We found that the NRG-1 transmembrane pre-
cursor transcripts expressed in schwannomas were structurally
diverse and included mRNAs encoding NRG-1 a2, b1, and b2
isoforms (Fig. 3). Using these same schwannoma cDNA
templates, we also attempted to amplify sequences encoding
the EGF-like common, EGF-like variant, and ‚Äò‚Äò3‚Äô‚Äô juxtamem-
brane domains of directly secreted NRG-1 isoforms. Although
these primers produced a PCR product of the expected size
from control templates, we could not detect secreted NRG-1
isoform transcripts in any of the 5 schwannomas tested (data
not shown).

The NRG-1 protein we detected in a normal eighth

potentially produced by cells endogenous to both tissue types.

experiments performed using primers speciÔ¨Åc for amino
terminal domain sequences present in all NRG-2 isoforms, we
readily detected NRG-2 mRNA in all 5 schwannomas (data
not shown). To compare the levels of expression of NRG-2
transcripts in schwannomas with that in normal nerve, we then
quantitated the levels of NRG-2 mRNA in these tissues.
Because the EGF-like domain of NRG-2, like that of NRG-1,
is alternatively spliced to produce isoforms with distinct
effects on cell growth and erbB phosphorylation (29), we

performed these analyses using real-time PCR with TaqMan
primers speciÔ¨Åc for NRG-2a or NRG-2b cDNAs and nor-
malized the resulting data to the levels of 18S ribosomal RNA
present in the same RT reactions. We found that the expression
of NRG-2a was elevated in 3 of 5 schwannomas with levels of
mRNA 1.8- to 10.0-fold higher than the levels found in normal

likewise upregulated 1.7- to 5.3-fold relative to normal nerve

mRNA.

Expression of Other NRG and Epidermal Growth
Factor Family Ligands in Human Schwannomas
The expression of erbB4 and EGFR in smaller subsets of
schwannomas (see subsequently)
raised the question of
whether other NRG and EGF family ligands capable of ac-
tivating these receptors might be expressed in schwannomas.
To test this hypothesis, we used RT-PCR to amplify sequences
encoding neuregulin-3 (NRG-3), neuregulin-4 (NRG-4), heparin-
binding EGF (HB-EGF), betacellulin, epiregulin, EGF, trans-
forming growth factor-a (TGFa), and amphiregulin. Tran-
scripts encoding HB-EGF and epiregulin, 2 ligands capable of
activating either erbB4 or EGFR, were evident in 4 of the
5 schwannomas (Fig. 6). We also found evidence that the
EGFR ligand TGFa was expressed in all 5 of these tumors. In
contrast, mRNAs for NRG-3, NRG-4, betacellulin, EGF, or
amphiregulin were undetectable in all of the schwannomas we
examined.

Schwannomas Express Multiple ErbB Kinases
and Demonstrate Constitutive Activation of
ErbB Signaling

NRG-1 and NRG-2 bind directly to the erbB3 and erbB4
membrane tyrosine kinases and subsequently induce hetero-
dimerization with erbB2 or, alternatively, in the case of erbB4,
homodimerization to form active signaling complexes (30,
31). To determine whether human schwannomas express the
erbB receptors necessary for responsiveness to NRG-1 or
NRG-2, we immunoblotted lysates of the same schwannomas
examined for NRG-1 expression (Table 1) and probed these
immunoblots with antibodies recognizing erbB2, erbB3, or
erbB4. ErbB2 and erbB3 were the most commonly expressed
erbB kinases in schwannomas, with a protein of the expected
185 kD size being detected in all 6 schwannomas by the anti-

170

erbB2 and anti-erbB3 antibodies (Fig. 7). Expression of erbB4
was more restricted, with an erbB4-immunoreactive protein
being readily identiÔ¨Åable in 3 of the 6 schwannomas. The
erbB2-, erbB3-, and erbB4-like immunoreactive polypeptides
found in schwannomas comigrated with erbB proteins de-
tected by these antibodies in normal eighth cranial nerve (Fig.

We conclude that one or more cell type within schwannomas

in 2 tumors (Fig. 8C). Paradoxically,

the
mRNA evident
expression of erbB4 transcripts was lower in all 5 schwanno-
mas than in normal nerve; we did note, however, that erbB4
mRNA accumulated to relatively higher
in the
3 schwannomas with the highest levels of erbB4 protein by
immunoblot (tumors 3, 4, and 6; Fig. 8D). The expression of
EGFR messenger RNA in schwannomas was lower or
equivalent to that observed in normal nerve in nearly all
tumors with only one schwannoma (4, the same tumor that
exhibited increased levels of EGFR protein in immunoblot
analyses) showing a very slight increase in EGFR mRNA
levels (Fig. 8A).

levels

To establish whether expression of speciÔ¨Åc erbB kinases
was associated with neoplastic Schwann cells, we immuno-
stained sections of the same schwannomas examined for
NRG-1 expression (Table 2) using antibodies recognizing
EGFR, erbB2, erbB3, or erbB4. Focal immunoreactivity for
EGFR was found in 3 of the 6 tumors, being evident as
cytoplasmic staining associated with patches of tumor cells
(Fig. 9A). In contrast, strong erbB2 immunoreactivity was
associated with the membranes and cytoplasm of tumor cells
throughout all 6 of the tumors (Fig. 9B). The anti-erbB3
mouse monoclonal antibody RTJ.1 similarly produced strong
staining of the membranes and cytoplasm of tumor cells in 4 of
the 6 neoplasms (Fig. 9C). An anti-erbB4 rabbit polyclonal
antiserum labeled tumor cells in 2 schwannomas (Fig. 9D), but
did so with a pattern distinct from that seen with the other 3
anti-erbB antibodies. ErbB4 immunoreactivity in tumor cells
was prominently associated with tumor cell nuclei as well as
the cytoplasm and membranes of these cells; the presence of
nuclear erbB4 immunoreactivity in schwannoma cells is con-
sistent with previous reports demonstrating that erbB4 can be
proteolytically cleaved and its carboxy terminus translocated
into the nucleus (31). In all instances, replacing the primary
antibody with nonimmune immunoglobulin or, when possible,
preincubating the primary antibody with the immunizing
peptide abolished erbB immunoreactivity in schwannomas.

ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all other
erbB receptors. Dimerization is accompanied by phosphory-
lation of multiple tyrosine residues in the carboxy terminal
including Tyr1248, a residue whose
sequences of erbB2,
phosphorylation is linked to activation of the ERK/MAP
kinase-signaling pathway. To determine whether erbB signal-
ing is constitutively activated in schwannomas, we immuno-
stained sections of these tumors with PN2A, a mouse monoclonal
antibody that recognizes erbB2 phosphorylated on Tyr1248.
PN2A immunoreactivity was readily identiÔ¨Åed in 4 of the
6 schwannomas, producing a punctate pattern of cytoplasmic
staining in a major subset of tumor cells (Fig. 9E) that was not
evident when the primary antibody was replaced with non-
immune IgG (Fig. 9F). We conclude that erbB signaling is
constitutively activated in at least some schwannomas.

DISCUSSION

There is extensive evidence indicating that inactivating
and missense mutations of the NF2 tumor-suppressor gene
play a key role in the pathogenesis of schwannomas. We have
hypothesized that inappropriate signaling by as yet unknown

expresses the complement of erbB receptors required for
responsiveness to NRG-1 and NRG-2.

The EGF receptor (EGFR, also known as erbB1) is
capable of heterodimerizing with and ‚Äò‚Äòcrosstalking‚Äô‚Äô to the
NRG-1 receptors. Furthermore, expression of the EGFR is
increased in other types of peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(32), including a subset of malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (33). To determine whether EGFR expression is
similarly inappropriately expressed in schwannomas, we also
probed normal eighth cranial nerve and schwannoma lysates
with an anti-EGFR antibody. With long exposures, a protein of
the expected 170-kD size was weakly detectable in normal
eighth cranial nerve using this antibody (data not shown).
However, only one of the 6 schwannomas tested expressed
detectable levels of EGFR protein (Fig. 7).

Our immunoblot analyses indicated that erbB2 and
erbB3 (and less
frequently, erbB4) were expressed in
schwannomas. To determine whether the expression of erbB
mRNAs was increased in schwannomas relative to their nerves
of origin, we performed real-time quantitative PCR assays on
normal eighth cranial nerve, normal spinal nerve, and
schwannoma cDNAs using TaqMan primer sets speciÔ¨Åc for
each erbB kinase. The levels of erbB transcripts established in
these assays were normalized to the levels of 18S ribosomal
RNA in the same cDNA. As shown in Figure 8, all 4 tran-
scripts were present to varying degrees in normal nerve and in
all of the tested schwannomas. Levels of erbB2 mRNA were
elevated in 4 of the schwannomas relative to normal nerve
(1.6- to 23-fold; Fig. 8B), with increased levels of erbB3

growth factors also contributes to this process and, based on
the results presented here, propose that NRG-1 and/or NRG-2
proteins are among the growth factors promoting schwannoma
tumorigenesis. In support of this hypothesis, we have found
that neoplastic Schwann cells within schwannomas express
multiple a and b transmembrane precursors from the class II
and III NRG-1 subfamilies as well as NRG-2 a and b
isoforms. Furthermore, schwannomas express transcripts
encoding NRG isoforms at levels much higher than those
found in normal nerve. We have also found that schwannomas

consistently express erbB2 and erbB3, 2 receptor tyrosine
kinases that mediate NRG-1 and NRG-2 responses. These
observations, considered together with our demonstration of
constitutive erbB2 phosphorylation in schwannomas, are con-
sistent with the hypothesis that autocrine, paracrine, and/or
juxtacrine NRG-1 and/or NRG-2 signaling in neoplastic
Schwann cells promotes schwannoma tumorigenesis. Our
results also raise intriguing questions about the role speciÔ¨Åc
NRG-1 and NRG-2 isoforms play in this process, how NRG-1
and NRG-2 actions in schwannomas differ from the actions of

these same growth factors in other types of peripheral nerve
sheath tumors such as neuroÔ¨Åbromas and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and the potential for in-
teractions between NRG-1/NRG-2 signaling and signaling by
other erbB ligands expressed in schwannomas.

Our real-time quantitative PCR analyses indicate that
schwannomas overexpress both a and b isoforms of NRG-1
and, to a lesser extent, NRG-2. NRG-1b is a potent mitogen
for nonneoplastic human (15, 34), monkey (35), and rat (16,
36) Schwann cells, suggesting that
these NRG isoforms
promote inappropriate proliferation of neoplastic Schwann
cells in schwannomas. In contrast, NRG-1a does not promote
Schwann cell proliferation (36). However, this does not mean
that NRG-1 a proteins have no effects on neoplastic Schwann
cells. In microarray experiments comparing the effects NRG-
1a and NRG-1b have on the transcriptome of nonneoplastic
Schwann cells, we have conÔ¨Årmed that NRG-1a stimulation
triggers a number of transcriptional alterations in these glia

(S. L. Carroll and M. S. Stonecypher, unpublished observations).
The effects NRG-2 a and b have on Schwann cell mitogenesis
have not yet been studied in detail, but NRG-2 a and b
isoforms similarly differ in their ability to stimulate the pro-
liferation of breast cancer cell lines (29). Considered together
with previous work indicating that NRG-1 and NRG-2 elicit
distinct biologic responses in at least some cell types (37),
these observations suggest that NRG-1a, NRG-1b, NRG-2a,
and NRG-2b will have isoform-speciÔ¨Åc effects on neoplastic
Schwann cells.

The expression of multiple transmembrane precursors
from the class II and class III NRG-1 subfamilies likely further
diversiÔ¨Åes NRG-1 signaling in human schwannomas. Class II
(GGF) NRG-1 proteins are heparin-binding molecules that are
released from the cells synthesizing them. After release, GGF
proteins act as paracrine or autocrine signaling molecules that
accumulate at high concentrations in structures such as the
basement membranes that individually invest neoplastic Schwann

cells within schwannomas. In contrast, class III NRG-1 pro-
teins remain membrane-associated and likely function only as
juxtacrine signaling molecules (21). Our data thus supports
a model in which NRG-1 promotes schwannoma formation in
a complex process involving paracrine, autocrine, and/or
juxtacrine signaling.

Before this study, there have been conÔ¨Çicting reports as
to whether NRG receptors are expressed in human schwan-
nomas. Hansen and Linthicum found that vestibular schwan-
nomas demonstrated immunoreactivity for erbB2, erbB3, and
NRG-1 (38). However, 2 other groups recently reported that
erbB2 (39, 40) and erbB3 (40) expression is absent or only
very weakly detectable in schwannomas. Using immunoblot,
RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochem-
ical analyses, we found that erbB2 and erbB3 were readily
detectable in schwannomas. ErbB2 and erbB3 were also the
most commonly expressed erbB kinases in schwannomas,
with protein and mRNA for
these receptors uniformly
expressed in our Ô¨Årst series of tumors (Table 1) and 4 of 6
neoplasms demonstrating immunoreactivity for both kinases
in our second series (Table 2). To further conÔ¨Årm the immu-
nohistochemical Ô¨Åndings described in this article, we sub-
sequently immunostained a third series of 29 eighth cranial
nerve schwannomas (27 sporadic, 2 NF2-associated) using
different erbB2 and erbB3 antibodies (data not shown);
immunoreactivity for both erbB2 and erbB3 was present in
27 of these tumors, including both NF2-associated schwan-
nomas. We conclude that erbB2 and erbB3 are indeed
expressed by neoplastic Schwann cells within nearly all
schwannomas and that
these tumor cells are potentially
responsive to NRG-1 and NRG-2 produced endogenously in
schwannomas.

In contrast

to relatively slowly growing and benign
schwannomas, neuroÔ¨Åbromas can become quite large and
transform into aggressive sarcomas (i.e. MPNSTs). We have
recently demonstrated that autocrine and/or paracrine NRG-
1/erbB signaling promotes neoplastic Schwann cell pro-
liferation in human neuroÔ¨Åbromas and MPNSTs (41) and that
transgenic mice expressing the NRG-1 isoform GGFb3 in
myelinating Schwann cells develop neoplasms with morpho-
logic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features highly
similar to those of human MPNSTs (42). Because our earlier
work and the Ô¨Åndings described here indicate that
in-
appropriate NRG/erbB signaling may be an important factor
in the pathogenesis of neuroÔ¨Åbromas, MPNSTs, and schwan-
nomas,
it must be asked why inappropriate NRG-1/erbB
signaling in these 3 different types of peripheral nerve sheath
tumors is associated with such major differences in clinical
behavior. In part, this is likely explained by differences in the
genetic abnormalities that accompany NRG/erbB signaling in
each tumor type. As noted, schwannomas typically develop
mutations in the NF2 tumor-suppressor gene. In contrast,
neuroÔ¨Åbromas demonstrate loss of neuroÔ¨Åbromin expression
and, as they progress and become MPNSTs, abnormalities in
additional tumor-suppressor genes, including p53, INK4A, and
p27kip1 (43). Another possibility is that schwannomas, neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas, and MPNSTs are derived from cells corresponding
to different stages of differentiation in the Schwann cell line-
age and that NRG/erbB signaling has distinct effects in these

174

different contexts. This hypothesis is consistent with the
observation that schwannomas typically show features highly
similar to mature Schwann cells, whereas MPNSTs demon-
strate a capacity for divergent differentiation reminiscent of
multipotent neural crest stem cells (43). Finally, it is evident
that schwannomas and neuroÔ¨Åbromas/MPNSTs have signif-
icant differences in their pattern of NRG and erbB expression.
Of particular note, we have detected NRG-2 expression in
schwannomas (this work), whereas we did not Ô¨Ånd evidence
for NRG-2 expression in neuroÔ¨Åbromas or MPNSTs (41). In
addition, although we only occasionally found evidence of
increased EGFR expression in schwannomas, many neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas and MPNSTs express elevated levels of this receptor
(32, 41).

Of the other 8 NRG and EGF ligands, only HB-EGF,
epiregulin, and TGFa were expressed in the majority of the
schwannomas we examined. In contrast, relatively high-level
expression of erbB4, which is activated by HB-EGF and
epiregulin, was evident only in a subset of these neoplasms,
whereas detectable expression of EGFR protein, which is the
receptor for all 3 of these ligands, was evident in only one tu-
mor. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that HB-
EGF, epiregulin, or TGFa also contributes to the pathogenesis
of at least a subset of schwannomas expressing erbB4 and
EGFR. Both erbB4 and EGFR are capable of heterodimerizing
with erbB2 and erbB3 (44), indicating that ligands activating
erbB4 and EGFR can ‚Äò‚Äòcrosstalk‚Äô‚Äô with erbB2 and erbB3 and
thus modify cellular responses triggered by NRG-1 or NRG-2
stimulation. In addition, NRG-1 and NRG-2 can also act
through erbB4; because each of the 4 erbB kinases activate
distinct proÔ¨Åles of cytoplasmic-signaling effectors (44), NRG
actions in erbB4-expressing schwannomas may differ from
those evident in tumors lacking this kinase.

In summary, our Ô¨Åndings support the hypothesis that
autocrine, paracrine, and/or juxtacrine signaling by multiple
NRG-1 and NRG-2 isoforms promotes the pathogenesis of
human schwannomas. Because erbB neutralizing antibodies
such as Herceptin and small molecular erbB inhibitors are
effective in treating other tumor types, these observations
suggest that inhibiting the NRG/erbB signaling may be an
effective means of treating patients with surgically unresect-
able schwannomas. Establishing the role individual erbB
kinases and speciÔ¨Åc NRG-1 and NRG-2 isoforms play in
schwannoma tumorigenesis will be important for the de-
velopment of innovative new approaches to treating these
peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
