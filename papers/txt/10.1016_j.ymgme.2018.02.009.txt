Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder While NF1 is primarily
associated with predisposition for tumor formation, muscle weakness has emerged as having a signiﬁcant impact
on quality of life. NF1 inactivation is linked with a canonical upregulation Ras-MEK-ERK signaling. This in this
study we tested the capacity of the small molecule MEK inhibitor PD0325901 to inﬂuence the intramyocellular
lipid accumulation associated with NF1 deﬁciency. Established murine models of tissue speciﬁc Nf1 deletion in
skeletal muscle (Nf1MyoD

−/−) and limb mesenchyme (Nf1Prx1

−/−) were tested.

Developmental PD0325901 dosing of dams pregnant with Nf1MyoD

−/− progeny rescued the phenotype of day
3 pups including body weight and lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining. In contrast, PD0325901 treatment of
−/− mice for 8 weeks had no impact on body weight, muscle wet weight, activity, or in-
4 week old Nf1Prx1
−/− pups showed diﬀerences between the two tissue-speciﬁc
tramyocellular lipid. Examination of day 3 Nf1Prx1
knockout strains, with lipid staining greatest in Nf1MyoD

−/− mice, and ﬁbrosis higher in Nf1Prx1

−/− mice.

These data show that a MEK/ERK dependent mechanism underlies NF1 muscle metabolism during devel-
opment. However, crosstalk from Nf1-deﬁcient non-muscle mesenchymal cells may impact upon muscle meta-
bolism and ﬁbrosis in neonatal and mature myoﬁbers.

1. Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic
disease associated with multi-system manifestations, including a pre-
disposition to tumor formation [1,2], cognitive developmental delays
aﬀecting executive functions [3,4], and a range of musculoskeletal
abnormalities [5,6]. Early reports of motor deﬁcits in NF1 children
were attributed to dysfunction in the central nervous system [7].
However, recent clinical studies have identiﬁed features suggestive of a
primary myopathy having substantial impact on individual quality of
life [6]. Reports of reduced muscle size [8], impaired exercise capacity
[9,10], and muscle weakness [9,11–13] align with anecdotal reports
from parents and clinicians describing fatigability and weakness as
relevant disease features. Notably, a 2015 study reports 30–50% re-
duced muscle strength in isolated upper and lower limb muscles of NF1
children when compared to matched controls [11]. Collectively these
data shifted the paradigm towards NF1 having a primary role in muscle
development, function, and/or maintenance.

Initial genetic studies deﬁned the NF1 protein product neuroﬁ-
bromin as a RasGTPase-activating protein (GAP) and a regulator of the
classic Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated-protein-kinase) signaling cas-
cades [14,15]. Notably, biochemical and genetic studies suggest a cri-
tical role for NF1-MAPK signaling in the regulation in muscle devel-
opment [16–18]. For example, neuroﬁbromin was found to be up
regulated during myoblast diﬀerentiation [18], and accordingly, in-
creased MAPK signaling in engineered myoblasts expressing GAP-re-
sistant H-Ras showed impaired myotube diﬀerentiation [19]. In mice,
global Nf1 inactivation is embryonic lethal and mutant embryos show
impaired cardiac and skeletal muscle development [16].

More recent work using conditional knockout mice indicate a cri-
tical role for the NF1-MAPK pathway in muscle energy metabolism. For
example, muscle-speciﬁc inactivation of murine Nf1 using the MyoD-
−/−) resulted in substantial intramyocellular
Cre transgene (Nf1MyoD

mitochondrial metabolic enzyme activity [20]. Intramyocellular lipid
accumulation is a pathological feature of a group of genetic disorders
known as lipid storage myopathies [21]. These include Primary Car-
nitine Deﬁciency (PCD), Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deﬁciency
(MADD) and Neutral Lipid Storage Disease (NLSD). All of these dis-
orders have been associated with mutations in enzymes speciﬁcally
involved in triglyceride metabolism, resulting in the build-up of lipid
within muscle ﬁbers and clinically manifesting as muscle weakness,
myalgia or extreme fatigue.

The function and relative signiﬁcance of NF1-Ras-MAPK signaling is
largely unknown in the context muscle, however studies outside of NF1
provide key insight. For example, molecular studies of the active MEK
kinase (a MAPK intermediate) show its inhibitory eﬀects on the myo-
genic regulatory factor MyoD, and suggest control of MEK phosphor-
ylation is critical for the transactivation of myogenic genes [22]. Clin-
ical data further corroborate these ﬁndings. When small molecule MEK
inhibitors (MEKi) PD98059 and Selumetinib (AZD6244) have been used
to treat malignant tumors, secondary increases in skeletal muscle mass
were observed in both mice [23] and humans [24].

PD0325901 represents one of the most potent and speciﬁc inhibitors
of MEK-ERK signaling (Ki of 1 nM against activated MEK1 and MEK2 in
vitro) and functions as a non-ATP competitive inhibitor [25]. In pre-
clinical murine models of NF1, the PD0325901 was found to enhance
bone formation in a tibial pseudarthrosis setting [26] and to suppress
growth of malignant-peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) [27].
PD0325901 is currently in phase-2 clinical trial for the treatment of
plexiform

NCT02096471. However, the ability of MEK inhibitors to ameliorate
muscle development and/or function in NF1 is yet to be trialed.

2. Results

2.1. Developmental dosing with PD0325901 rescues myopathic features of
neonatal Nf1MyoD

−/− mice

To test the hypothesis that the development of intramyocellular
−/− mice is MAPK/ERK signaling dependent,
lipid deposits in Nf1MyoD
−/− pups were orally dosed with
pregnant females bearing Nf1MyoD
5 mg/kg/day PD0325901 via jelly feeding from ED9.5. This
PD0325901 delivery method has been previously validated by us in the
context of fracture healing models [26]. Pups were born and culled
3 days after birth, and tissues were harvested for analysis. Primary
outcome measures were changes in body weight and muscle lipid ac-
cumulation.

Embryonic dosing with PD0325901 resulted in an increase in
−/−mice at day 3 compared with those un-
bodyweight of Nf1MyoD
treated (Fig. 1A). Notably, while pup bodyweight was not completely
restored to WT levels, a signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment was still observed
−/− groups (Fig. 1A). Subsequent histological analysis
between Nf1MyoD
of muscle tissues using Oil Red O found a striking 56% reduction in
lipid staining in muscle cross sections (mid-belly of the quadriceps) of
treated mice (Fig. 1B–C). Representative images illustrated the dra-
matic reduction in staining to WT levels (Fig. 1C). Subsequent western
blot analyses of treated dam tissues conﬁrmed daily dosing with
PD0325901 results in substantial knockdown of signaling through the
MAPK/MEK/ERK cascade, shown by the substantial reductions in ERK
phosphorylation levels (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with our
previous report, there was observed changes in myoﬁber cross-section
or sarcomeric structure [20].

2.2. PD0325901 dosing (pre- and post-natal) does not rescue myopathic
features of the Nf1Prx1

−/− mouse

While the Nf1MyoD

−/− mouse model is ideal for developmental
studies, the high neonatal lethality prior to day 7 prevents testing
therapeutics in adult Nf1null muscle in this mouse line [20]. Thus, to
assess the ability of PD0325901 treatment to reverse the muscle phe-
−/− mouse. This strain
notype in mature muscle, we adopted the Nf1Prx1
survives post-weaning, and presents with reduced bodyweight, reduced
muscle size, and muscle weakness [28].

−/− and Nf1MyoD

−/− strain, Nf1Prx1

An assessment of neonatal Nf1Prx1

−/− tissues was
ﬁrst performed to compare their respective phenotypic features.
−/− neonates were bred and culled prior to weaning, and tissues
Nf1Prx1
were assessed for features of myopathy at day 3 post-birth. In line with
−/− neonates were sig-
data from the Nf1MyoD
niﬁcantly smaller at day 3 compared to littermate controls (Fig. 2A).
Histological analysis of neonatal muscle using H&E staining found
substantial endomysial ﬁbrosis and inﬁltrating mononuclear cells
throughout the muscle belly (Fig. 2B). Representative whole tissue
sections show the striking phenotypic diﬀerences at both the macro-
scopic (2×) and microscopic (20×) levels (Fig. 2B). Assessment of
muscle lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining conﬁrmed focal re-
−/− neonatal muscle ﬁbers (Fig. 2B).
gions of increased lipid in Nf1Prx1
−/− mice from 4 weeks of age were treated with
PD0325901 to assess any eﬀects of therapeutic reversal. Mice were
dosed orally with 5 mg/kg/day PD0325901 via jelly feeding. Dosing
continued for 8 consecutive weeks and mice were culled at 12 weeks of
age for analysis. Primary outcome measures included changes in
bodyweight, changes in isolated muscle weight, muscle histopathology,
and functional muscle measures of grip strength and activity via open
ﬁeld testing.

Next, Nf1Prx1

Measures of bodyweight, grip strength, and muscle weight, were all
signiﬁcantly higher for WT mice compared with either untreated or
−/− mice (Fig. 3A–C). No eﬀect of PD0325901 treatment
treated Nf1Prx1
−/− groups could be detected by analysis-of-variance
between Nf1Prx1
(ANOVA) with multiple comparisons (Fig. 3A–C). Similarly, functional
assessment of physical activity and fatigue using open-ﬁeld testing
found no detectable eﬀects of PD0325901 treatment on the number of
hind-limb rears (Fig. 3D), total distance travelled (Fig. 3E), or total
activity (Fig. 3F) within a 15 min period. A subsequent histological
analysis of muscle tissues using H&E and Oil Red O conﬁrmed that the
myopathic features of endomysial ﬁbrosis and focal lipid accumulations
seen in neonates remained present in adult muscle, and were not ap-
preciably eﬀected by PD0325901 treatment (Fig. 3G).

−/− can inﬂuence the murine phenotype. Such a
tissues in the Nf1Prx1
phenomenon has been previously reported to aﬀect the NF1 tumor
microenvironment, with signaling from Nf1+/− ﬁbroblasts aﬀecting
Nf1−/− neuroﬁbroma cells [29].

Several lines of evidence suggest that the initiation and progression
of the myogenic program is critically regulated by the Ras-MAPK/ERK
cascade. Notably, in vitro myoblast experiments have demonstrated
that impaired myoblast diﬀerentiation following Ras activation is in-
dependent of Pi3K-AKT signaling [19,30], and is instead mediated via
the MEK/ERK dependent modulation of key factors such as MyoD [22]
and the myosin heavy-chain promotors [30]. In mice, increased myo-
ﬁber ERK phosphorylation and impaired myoblast diﬀerentiation was
seen in embryonic muscle following Nf1 inactivation [28], however, in
adult muscle from the same strain, ERK activation was normal [28].
Collectively these data align with descriptions of the inhibition of
MAPK/ERK signaling by Pi3K-AKT late in the myogenic program [30],
and could explain the redundancy of PD0325901 treatment in post
mitotic Nf1null muscle.

Genetic and/or developmental diﬀerences between the Nf1MyoD

−/−
−/− strains also needs to be considered. Prx1-cre expression
and Nf1Prx1
is most active in the hind limbs from ED10.5–11 [31], approximately
1.5 developmental days after MyoD-cre [32]. Thus, by this develop-
mental time Ras-MAPK/ERK signaling may be diﬀerentially required.
Indeed, we have previously noted substantial diﬀerences in outcomes
between strains [20]. For example, elevated activity of mitochondrial
enzymes citrate synthase (CS), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), beta-
hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (BHAD), and medium-chain Acyl-CoA
−/− muscle, but not in
dehydrogenases (MCAD) was present in Nf1Prx1
−/− mice [20]. We have speculated that this
extracts from Nf1MyoD
−/− mice may be compensatory [20],
enzyme upregulation in Nf1Prx1
and may assist with the compensatory clearing of intramyocellular

lipid.

Diﬀerences between aﬀected muscle groups as well as the eﬃciency
of Cre-mediated recombination may also be contributing. MyoD-Cre
drives inactivation in all skeletal muscle precursors, and thus all de-
veloping body and limb skeletal muscles. In contrast, Prx1-Cre expres-
sion targets the fore and hind limbs [31], leaving the axial musculature
genetically normal and this could provide a level of metabolic com-
pensation. The Prx1-Cre transgene may also be less eﬃcient, as PCR of a
−/− mice shows a residual pre-
range of muscle groups in the Nf1Prx1
sence of the non-excised allele [28]. Together, these may explain the
−/− mice [20], as well as diﬀerences
increased survivability of Nf1Prx1
in lipid accumulation and mitochondrial enzyme activity.

The capacity of MEKi to improve fracture healing in NF1 models of
pseudarthroses is relevant to consider in the context of this study [33].
Fracture healing recapitulates many of the cellular processes that occur
during skeletal development [34]. This further reﬂects the critical role
for NF1 in developmental rather than post-mitotic cell biology. For
example, adult Nf1+/− mice have signiﬁcantly impaired rates of bone
healing following fracture [35], however, in the absence of fracture
Nf1+/− bones appear normal [20]. Similarly, the reported increases in
muscle mass following MEKi dosing in cancer patients [24] likely re-
ﬂects the mitigation of muscle wasting through an increased rate of
muscle repair; a process recapitulating embryonic myogenesis invol-
ving the progressive fusion of muscle stem cells [32,36]. While MEKi
treatment improved bone healing outcomes in Nf1null fractures, its
notable that treatment had no eﬀect on ﬁbrotic tissue inﬁltrate in the
above-mentioned study [33].

A well-described limitation of the Nf1Prx1

−/− model is that they
have reduced size, body weight, and can develop fused joints during
development [28]. This can have a signiﬁcant impact on animal ac-
tivity, and may in combination with reduced muscle mass contribute to

was eﬀectively used to test an enriched medium chain fatty acid and
carnitine supplemented diet; signiﬁcant changes in grip strength and
−/−
intramyocellular lipid were seen with this treatment in the Nf1Prx1
mouse [37].

Increased muscle ﬁbrosis has been previously reported in Nf1Prx1

−/

− mice [28], and remained unaﬀected by PD0325901 treatment in our
study (Fig. 3) and was described for the ﬁrst time in early neonatal
muscle (Fig. 4B). This suggests a MEK/ERK independent regulatory
mechanism in this mesenchymal cell subtype. Indeed, negligible muscle

tributable to tissue-speciﬁc isoforms of NF1 [17,38], whose diﬀerential
function remains unclear.

Current clinical evidence indicates that NF1-associated muscle
dysfunction does not feature by muscle wasting, but is rather char-
acterized by a combination of metabolic weakness and fatigability [6].

4.1. Mouse strains and husbandry

Animal experiments were approved by the Westmead Hospital
Animal Ethics Committee or the Children's Hospital at Westmead/
Children's Medical Research Institute Animal Ethics Committee. The
MyoD-Cre transgenic mice were a gift from Prof David Goldhamer
−/− mice [20] were
(University of Connecticut, CN, USA). Nf1MyoD
generated by an F1 cross of MyoD-Cre and Nf1ﬂox mice to produce
MyoD-Cre+/− Nf1ﬂox/+ mice. They were then backcrossed to the par-
ental Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox strain to generate experimental homozygous (F2)
knockout animals MyoD-Cre+/− Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox (Nf1MyoD

−/−).

colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Prx1-Cre transgenic mice [31] and Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice [39] (sourced
from the NIH) were crossed to produce ﬁrst generation Prx1-Cre+/−
Nf1ﬂox/+ mice. They were then backcrossed to the parental Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
strain to generate experimental homozygous knockout animals Prx1
Cre+/− Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox (Nf1Prx1

−/−) [28].

Nf1Prx1

−/− mice were distinctly smaller than their littermates. To
ensure their survival and reduce maternal rejection for adult studies,
smaller pups were given daily saline injections of 0.05–0.1 mL until
bodyweight normalisation. Samples were collected at two weeks of age
for genotyping by quantitative real-time PCR for the Cre and Nf1ﬂox
alleles (Transnet YX, U.S.A). All colonies were maintained on a C57/B6
background.

4.2. PD0325901 dosing

PD0325901 was delivered to the mice orally via feeding of straw-
berry-ﬂavoured jelly. This jelly was composed of 0.8% DMSO (Sigma-
Aldrich) with or without PD0325901 (Selleck Chemicals) dissolved,
16% SPLENDA low Calorie Sweetener (Johnson & Johnson Paciﬁc, New
South Wales, Australia), 9.6% gelatin to maintain jelly shape (GELITA
Australia, New South Wales, Australia), and 7.9% ﬂavouring (QUEEN
Flavouring Essence
Imitation Strawberry, Queen Fine Foods,
Queensland, Australia). Single housing of the mice assured that the jelly
was being consumed. This method has been previously published [26].

4.3. Histological staining

Neonatal hind limbs were harvested from animals at cull, surface
coated in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek USA), placed
on a thin piece of tin foil, frozen in isopentane (2-methyl butane) su-
percooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Sections 8 μm thick
were cut on a Leica CM1950 Clinical Cryostat, captured on Superfrost™
Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA), and stored at 4 °C prior

523

to staining.

H&E and Oil Red O staining were performed as previously published
[20]. Quantiﬁcation was performed using Fiji ImageJ [40], by mea-
suring total lipid stained (red) area as a percentage of the total section
area.

4.4. Western blotting and antibodies

Western blots were performed on muscle lysates from MEKi treated
and untreated mice. Muscle tissues were cryosectioned (15–20 × 8 μm
sections) and collected for solubilization. Samples were lysed by agi-
tation at 4 °C for 30 min in RIPA Buﬀer (Sigma R0278) with protease
(Sigma P8340) and phosphatase (Sigma P5726) inhibitors added. Total
protein content was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce 23,225)
with a BSA standard curve. Samples were then heated to 94 °C for 3 min
and prepared for loading. Twenty microgram of total protein/sample
was run on 4–20% polyacrylamide precast gels (Bio-Rad) in Tris-
Glycine buﬀer. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane.
Antibodies used for Western blotting were Phospho-p44/42 MAPK
(Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Antibody #9101) 1:2000,
and p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Cell signaling Antibody #9102) 1:2000.

4.5. Grip strength testing

Grip strength testing was performed using a specialty mouse grip
strength tester (Columbus instruments). Grip strength (peak force in
Newtons) was measured in 3 sets of 5 eﬀorts, with a 20 s rest between
sets; for a total of 15 measures. The highest and lowest readings were
excluded, and remaining readings were averaged. To ensure unbiased
reliable testing, an experienced technician performed all testing for the
study duration and was blinded to treatment group and mouse geno-
type.

4.6. Open ﬁeld-testing

Open ﬁeld measurements were performed using an infrared (IR)
Actimeter (PanLab Harvard Apparatus). Mice cages were placed in the
testing room and left for 30 min to acclimatize to room conditions. At
initiation of testing, one mouse is placed in the centre of the open ﬁeld
and allowed to voluntarily explore undisturbed for a 15 min period.
Movement data are automatically and electronically recorded by the IR
sensors and PanLab software, and exported for analysis. The ﬁeld cage
is thoroughly cleaned using ethanol between each mouse tested.

4.7. Statistical analysis

Biological and technical replicates were conducted at least 3 times
for all histological staining experiments. Experimental results are ex-
pressed as mean ± standard deviation (unless otherwise speciﬁed).
Where 2 groups were compared, statistical comparisons were made
using parametric two-tailed Student's t-tests. Multiple group compar-
isons were done using ANOVA with a Dunn's post-hoc multiple com-
parisons test. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically sig-
niﬁcant.
