To the Editor,
Neuroﬁ bromatosis  type  2  is  a  hereditary  tumor 
predisposition  syndrome  manifesting  with  bilateral 
vestibular  schwannomas,  schwannomas  of  other 
cranial  nerves,  meningiomas,  spinal  schwannomas, 
ependymomas  and  other  gliomas.  It  is  caused  by 
mutations of a tumor suppressor gene called ‘Mer-
lin’ [1]. Surgery and radiation therapy are the only 
established  treatment  options  [2,3].  Recently,  a 
hearing improvement and a reduction of tumor vol-
ume  of  vestibular  schwannomas  and  intracerebral 
meningiomas after systemic treatment with bevaci-
zumab  have  been  documented  [4–12].  We  now 
report  an  impressive  effect  of  bevacizumab  treat-
ment on symptomatic peripheral schwannomas with 
a  fast  and  complete  pain  relief  in  a  patient  with 
neuroﬁ bromatosis type 2.

Case report

A 27-year-old woman with known neuroﬁ bromatosis 
type 2 was referred to our outpatient clinics because 
of symptomatic progression.

According to the Manchester criteria the diagno-
sis of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 2 was made eight years 
earlier,  at  which  time  the  patient  presented  with 
bilateral  hearing 
impairment.  The  radiological 
ﬁ ndings  were  consistent  with  the  manifestation  of 
bilateral  vestibular  schwannomas.  In  the  following 
years  both  lesions  were  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery. Some years later, after a symptomatic 
progression, the right-sided tumor was treated with 
a  partial  resection.  Histologically,  a  schwannoma 

(WHO grade I) was conﬁ rmed. Additionally, multi-
ple symptomatic spinal and peripheral schwannomas 
were resected in the following years (Supplementary 
Figure  1  available  online  at  http://informahealth-
care.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0284186X.2014.956185).
At  the  time  of  admission  the  patient  mainly 
suffered  from  progressive  left-sided  hearing  loss 
and  a  severe  lumbovertebral  pain  syndrome. The 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 
a  progressive  lesion  in  the  left  cochlear  apex. 
Figure 1 shows a T1-weighted sagittal gadolinium-
enhanced MRI of the lumbar spine with numerous 
partially  conﬂ uent  schwannomas.  Compared  to  a 
previous  MRI  there  was  a  progression  of  an 
intraspinal  schwannoma  at  T12/L1  and  a  newly 
described schwannoma at L4 with typical features 
of heterogeneous contrast enhancement and some 
cystic changes. Due to the high number of schwan-
nomas, no single lesion could be identiﬁ ed as cause 
for the pain.

Due to the symptomatic multifocal disease pro-
gression  and  particularly  the  progressive  hearing 
loss  we  decided  to  start  an  intravenous  treatment 
with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Before treatment the 
lumbovertebral pain intensity was severely interfer-
ing with daily life even though the patient was on 
a combined analgetic treatment with opioids, met-
amizol  and  gabapentin.  Interestingly,  only  a  few 
days after the ﬁ rst infusion, the patient reported a 
dramatic  reduction  and  ﬁ nally  disappearance  of 
the  lumbovertebral  pain  syndrome.  Hence,  all 
analgetic drugs could be stopped within two weeks. 
In  contrast,  the  follow-up  audiometry  did  not

document a hearing improvement. The treatment 
was  continued  for  18  months  without  pain  recur-
rence. Figure 2 shows MRI follow-up four months 
after therapy stop with mixed response, but stable 
disease  measured  by  RECIST  1.1  criteria.  The 
tumor  at  level  T12/L1  had  diminished  in  size, 
while  the  tumor  at  level  L4  had  increased  in  size 
and multiple additional schwannomas were stable 
in size.

Five months after bevacizumab was stopped the 
patient became symptomatic again with pain in the 
lumbovertebral  region  irradiating  into  the  right 
leg. The  neurological  exam  excluded  sensomotoric 
deﬁ cits. New pathologic bony lesions were excluded 
by x-ray. We concluded that again, the known spinal 
schwannomas caused the pain and reinstalled a treat-
ment with bevacizumab. Before treatment start, the 
patient  was  on  an  analgetic  medication  with  met-
amizol and gabapentin without any relevant success; 
8/10  points  were  documented  on  the  visual  pain 
scale. After applying the ﬁ rst infusion of bevacizumab 
the  pain  decreased  again  very  rapidly  (Figure  3). 

The  patient  was  pain-free  without  analgetic  drugs 
two weeks thereafter.

Discussion

Neuroﬁ bromatosis  type  2  is  an  inherited  disease 
associated  mainly  with  benign  tumors  such  as 
schwannomas,  meningiomas,  ependymomas  and 
other  gliomas.  A  majority  of  these  tumors  can  be 
treated  with  surgery  or  radiotherapy  in  the  case  of 
symptomatic  disease  [2,3].  Until  recently,  systemic 
therapy had no role in the treatment of neuroﬁ bro-
matosis type 2. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has no sig-
niﬁ cant impact in these slowly proliferating neoplasms. 
Therefore, a number of potential therapeutic targets 
have  been  investigated  taking  into  account  the 
complex downstream signaling pathways involved in 
the pathogenesis of this disease [4–12].

Whereas  vestibular  schwannomas  are  causing 
hearing deﬁ cits, pain is more often the leading symp-
tom  in  peripheral  schwannomas. This  neuropathic 
pain  is  often  difﬁ cult  to  manage  and  resistant  to

treatment  with  analgetic  drugs. The  patient  in  this 
case report experienced an impressive and very fast 
symptomatic  response  after  only  one  infusion  of 
bevacizumab.

The effect of bevacizumab on intracranial ves-
tibular  schwannomas  and  meningiomas  has  been 
reported  before,  whereas  hardly  any  date  is  avail-
able  on  the  effect  on  peripheral  schwannomas 
[4–12].

Antiangiogenic  therapy  targeting  VEGF  or  its 
receptors modiﬁ es the vascular network by decreas-
ing the number of blood vessels and normalizing the 
remaining  vessels  with  regard  to  morphology  and 
functionality.  However,  the  observed  effect  with  a 
pain relief within a few days most likely is not due to 
a reduction or normalization of blood vessels with a 
consecutive effect on the tumor cells. Most likely, the 
effect of bevacizumab is a consequence of the reduced 
endothelial  permeability  and  subsequent  tumor 
edema  [8]. This  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  the 
mean apparent diffusion coefﬁ cient (ADC) value of 
the tumor at baseline is associated with radiographic 
response  in  vestibular  schwannoma  treated  with 
bevacizumab [9].

In summary, we document a dramatic reduction 
of  pain  caused  by  peripheral  schwannomas  after 
treatment with bevacizumab in a patient with neuro-
ﬁ bromatosis  type  2.  These  ﬁ ndings  may  warrant 
further investigation of bevacizumab in this speciﬁ c 
clinical situation.

To the Editor,

Intensity-modulated  radiation  therapy  (IMRT)  is 
particularly  useful  for  treating  irregularly  shaped 
planning  target  volumes  (PTVs)  whilst  minimizing 
doses  to  organs  at  risk  (OARs). Volumetric  modu-
lated  arc  therapy  (VMAT)  is  a  form  of  rotational 
IMRT that typically requires less delivery time and 
monitor  units  (MU)  compared  to  static  IMRT 
beams. Treatment planning aims to create plans with 
an  optimal  trade-off  between  PTV  coverage  and 
OAR sparing [1–3]. In the search for better VMAT 
plans there are many parameters that the planner can 
modify, including the number of arcs. We previously 
demonstrated  that  RapidArc®  (Varian  Medical 
Systems,  Palo  Alto,  CA,  USA)  with  two  arcs  was 
associated  with  improved  plan  quality  over  a  single 
arc and increased agreement between calculated and 
measured  doses,  while  beam-on  time  was  still  less 
than 3 minutes [4]. Since the RapidArc optimization 
algorithm tries to maximize gantry speed we hypoth-
esized  that  using  more  than  two  arcs,  which  would 
allow for a longer delivery time and more opportu-
nity  for  modulation,  might  translate  into  further 
gains in plan quality. We investigated the relationship 
between the number of arcs, PTV dose homogeneity 
and OAR sparing.

Material and methods

General considerations

Planning CT scans from 10 patients with head and 
neck cancer previously treated using RapidArc were 
selected  for  this  retrospective  planning  study. The 
head and neck location was selected because it is a 
challenging  scenario  for  treatment  planning.  Plans 
were created using the current institutional simulta-
neous integrated boost (SIB) technique described in 
detail  previously  [5].  In  brief,  this  aims  to  deliver 
54.25  Gy/70  Gy  to  the  elective/boost  PTV  (PTVE/
PTVB) in 35 fractions. PTVB consisted of the gross 
tumor  volume  and  biopsy-proven  positive  lymph 
nodes with a 5 mm margin for microscopic disease 
(edited  for  anatomical  boundaries)  and  a  4–5  mm 
PTV  margin.  PTVE  consisted  of  elective  nodal 
regions, with a 4–5mm PTV margin, minus a 5mm 
transition zone (PTVT), which was created between 
PTVB and PTVE to allow for a steep dose falloff.

OARs with only a maximum dose objective taken 
into account in the optimization included the brain-
stem, spinal cord, and their planning at risk volumes 
(PRV)  after  3mm  expansion.  OAR  for  which  the 
aim  was  to  reduce  the  mean  dose  included  salivary 
structures (e.g. the ipsilateral and contralateral parotid
