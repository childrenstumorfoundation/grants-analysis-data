Schwannomas are tumors that develop from Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves and commonly arise from the vestibular
nerve. Vestibular schwannomas can present unilaterally and sporadically or bilaterally when the tumor is associated with
neuroﬁbromatosis Type 2 (NF2) syndrome. The molecular hallmark of the disease is biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene.
The epigenetic signature of schwannomas remains poorly understood and is mostly limited to DNA methylation of the NF2
gene, whose altered expression due to epigenetic factors in this tumor is controversial. In this study, we tested the genome-
wide DNA methylation pattern of schwannomas to shed light on this epigenetic alteration in these particular tumors. The
methodology used includes Inﬁnium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip microarrays in a series of 36 vestibular schwan-
nomas, 4 nonvestibular schwannomas, and 5 healthy nerves. Our results show a trend toward hypomethylation in schwan-
nomas. Furthermore, homeobox (HOX) genes, located at four clusters in the genome, displayed hypomethylation in several
CpG sites in the vestibular schwannomas but not in the nonvestibular schwannomas. Several microRNA (miRNA) and
protein-coding genes were also found to be hypomethylated at promoter regions and were conﬁrmed as upregulated by
expression analysis; including miRNA-21, Met Proto-Oncogene (MET), and PMEPA1. We also detected methylation patterns
that might be involved in alternative transcripts of several genes such as NRXN1 or MBP, which would increase the complex-
ity of the methylation and expression patterns. Overall, our results show speciﬁc epigenetic signatures in several coding
genes and miRNAs that could potentially be used as therapeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION

Schwannomas are low-grade tumors that arise
from the Schwann cells of peripheral nerves.
Although these tumors can originate from numer-
ous locations, they usually develop from the vesti-
bulocochlear nerve, accounting for up to 10% of
intracranial tumors. Vestibular schwannomas can
be sporadic and unilateral or bilateral when they
are associated with the genetic disorder known as
neuroﬁbromatosis Type 2 (NF2) syndrome. Cur-
rent treatment options for schwannomas include

and radiosurgery.

which at the cytogenetic level was observed as
monosomy of chromosome 22 (Rey et al., 1987;
Bello et al., 1993). NF2 encodes for Merlin, a
FERM domain protein that has two main isoforms
and a wide variety of functions. Tumor mecha-
nisms via the loss of Merlin function occur in the
cytosol
tyrosine kinase
receptors, the hippo pathway or angiomotin; Yi
et al., 2011) and the nucleus, suppressing tumori-
genesis
ligase
CRL4DCAF1 (Li et al., 2010). Other molecular
alterations include ErbB2-ErbB3/Nrg1 constitu-
tional activation (Doherty et al., 2008), caveolin-1
downregulation (Aarhus et al., 2010), and MET
and osteopontin upregulation, which has been sug-
gested as an alternative to Merlin degradation in
schwannomas (Torres-Martin et al., 2013a, 2013b).
It has also been proposed that a Yes-associated
protein 1 (YAP)-driven signaling network induces
tumor proliferation (Boin et al., 2014). Several
clinical trials on treating schwannomas in NF2
patients have been conducted in recent years, a
number of which have had promising outcomes
(Plotkin et al., 2009), while others have shown no
patient improvement (Plotkin et al., 2010; Kara-
jannis et al., 2014).

Among epigenetic mechanisms, cytosine meth-
ylation at CpG dinucleotides is probably the most
widely studied. The CpG sites are usually clus-
tered within the DNA in enriched zones known as
CpG islands, ﬂanked by less enriched shores and
then by shelves. Methylation has been studied in
gene promoter at transcriptional start site (TSS)
and 50-UTR regions, normally in connection with
repression. Nevertheless,
mRNA transcriptional
current research is increasing attention on the
lesser-known mechanisms of action of methylation
within gene bodies and 30-UTR regions. Recent
experiments have shown that
intragenic DNA
methylation might be related to the regulation of
alternative promoters (Maunakea et al., 2010) or to
controlling transcriptional noise (Huh et al., 2013).
The methylation processes for diseases such as
cancer have been widely reported (Portela and
Esteller 2010). Tumor-suppressor gene silencing
and oncogene hypomethylation are well-known
mechanisms of tumor development. The individ-
ual patient response to treatment can be pre-
dicted, such as the glioma response to alkylating
agents based on MGMT methylation status (Estel-
ler et al., 2000). MicroRNA (miRNA) also present
aberrant epigenetic processes, in the same manner
as protein-coding genes (Lopez-Serra and Esteller
2012). DNA methylation also participates
in

embryogenesis and tissue development, with
homeobox (HOX) cluster genes playing a pivotal
role in this process.

In schwannomas, the aberrant methylation of
(including THBS1, MGMT, TP73, and
genes
TIMP3) has been identiﬁed by methylation-
speciﬁc PCR (Gonzalez-Gomez et al., 2003; Bello
et al., 2007). NF2 methylation does not seem to be
a mechanism of Merlin loss in schwannomas
(Koutsimpelas et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012),
although speciﬁc CpG sites might be involved
(Kino et al., 2001). Thus, the epigenetic landscape
of schwannomas remains poorly described and
understood. Current wide epigenetic genomic
proﬁling techniques
include next generation
sequencing and microarray technology. Using
these techniques, numerous prognostic factors
have been identiﬁed, including the CpG island
methylator phenotype in various tumors such as
oligodendrogliomas (Mur et al., 2013) and ependy-
momas (Mack et al., 2014). Using the Illumina
450k Inﬁnium BeadChip kit, we tested 485,000
individual CpG sites to ﬁnd aberrant methylation
in 36 vestibular and 4 nonvestibular schwannomas.
Our aim was to detect aberrant methylation along
tumors, differential methylation of CpG sites
based on clinical characteristics and ultimately to
ﬁnd potential therapeutic targets. These ﬁndings
were correlated with whole genome expression
data from our previous analysis of the same cases,
to determine whether there was any relationship
between distinct epigenetic changes and gene
expression variations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and DNA/RNA Preparation

The study was performed on 40 tumors from 39
patients (16 men and 23 women) who underwent
surgery in our institution. The local ethics review
board of University Hospital La Paz approved the
study protocol according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients received
detailed information on the study and provided
their written informed consent prior to their inclu-
sion. The study population included 36 cases of
vestibular schwannoma, six of which were related
to NF2 syndrome. Four sporadic nonvestibular
schwannomas were also added to the study (three
spinal and one cervical). For control purposes, ﬁve
healthy nerves with exclusive axonal content were
used. DNA was
isolated using the Wizard
Genomic DNA puriﬁcation kit (Promega). DNA

from the corresponding patients’ peripheral blood
was also extracted. RNA from the four nonvestibu-
lar schwannomas was isolated using the RNeasyVR
Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Methylation Microarray Protocol

For the methylation analysis, 1 mg of DNA from
the 40 tumors and 5 healthy nerves was treated
with bisulﬁte using the EZ DNA methylation Kit
(Zymo Research), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The converted DNA was then hybri-
dized on the Inﬁnium Human Methylation 450K
BeadChip (Illumina), which examines 485,577
CpG sites across the whole genome. Arrays were
processed at CEGEN, and the data can be
accessed at the gene expression omnibus (GEO)
database GSE56596.

Inﬁnium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip
Analysis

The analysis was performed using R statistical
software. To import iDAT ﬁles into the R envi-
ronment for processing, the lumi package was
used (Du et al., 2008). After importing the iDAT
ﬁles, we obtained a MethyLumiM class object.
First, a background correction was performed with
the bgAdjust method, and color bias was adjusted
by the quantile method. Color bias adjustment
was performed because the differences between
the red and green channels were very pronounced
(Supporting Information Fig. 1). Normalization
was performed using simple scaling normalization.
M-values were used instead of B-values due to the
severe heteroscedasticity of the data when they
were not in the middle of the methylation range
(Du et al., 2010); M-values were, therefore, more
statistically valid. After processing the data, the

methyAnalysis package was used for data visual-
ization in the integrative genomics viewer (Robin-
son et al., 2011; Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013). This
task was performed by converting the MethyLu-
miM class into the MethyGenoSet class. Next, the
export.methyGenoSet function was used to create a
.cgt ﬁle. M-values were exported to a text ﬁle, and
the data were then analyzed with an Illumina
Methylation Analyzer (IMA) package (Wang et al.,
2012). The necessary P values were obtained from
GenomeStudio. With IMA functions, probes from
X and Y chromosomes were removed due to the
bias between male and female. In addition, low-
quality CpG sites (P value > 0.05 in 75% of the
samples) were ﬁltered, as were probes containing
SNPs. Methylation index calculations were per-
formed at gene-based (TSS, 50-UTR, ﬁrst exon,
Gene Body, and 30-UTR region) and CpG
location-based regions (CpG island, shores, and
shelves). This process was performed using the
regionswrapper command, which is explained by
Wang et al.
(2012). The speciﬁc methylation
between groups for each CpG was analyzed using
Student’s t-test. Differential methylation among the
groups was established at the Bonferroni-adjusted P
value <0.05 and an M-value cutoff of 1. This value
is within the range recommended by Du et al.,
(2010). Four groups of samples were created: spo-
radic vestibular schwannomas, NF2-related vestibu-
lar schwannomas, nonvestibular schwannomas, and
control nerves. Since both vestibular groups were
homogeneous, we combined those two groups for
comparison against healthy tissue and nonvestibular
schwannomas. Additionally, vestibular samples were
classiﬁed by clinical group. An enrichment analysis
of hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes was
performed using DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) with a
single CpG list, removing duplicates and CpG sites

with no associated name. In both lists, the total num-
ber of genes was below the limit supported by
DAVID.

Expression Microarrays

To investigate whether the methylation pattern
had an impact on gene expression, we used our
previously published and available gene expres-
sion microarray data on the same series of vestibu-
lar schwannomas (Torres-Martin et al., 2013a,
2013b) and miRNAs (Torres-Martin et al., 2013a,
2013b) to compare with the methylation data. We
deﬁned a gene or miRNA as deregulated when we
detected at least a 2-fold change in expression and
a P < 0.05 cutoff by Student’s t-test. For the region-
swrapper analysis from the IMA package,
the
genes that met those criteria were selected. Multi-
Experiment Viewer (MeV) software (Saeed et al.,
2003, 2006) was used for the expression array
analysis.

The four nonvestibular schwannomas that were
not included in our previous analysis were tested
with microarrays. Brieﬂy, Human Gene 1.0 ST
arrays were hybridized as previously described
(Torres-Martin et al., 2013a, 2013b). Normaliza-
tion and summarization were performed using the
RMA (robust multichip average) algorithm and
were batch corrected with the other vestibular
tumors using ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007). An
exon-level analysis, which allowed us to test sev-
eral isoforms of a given gene, was used. All statisti-
cal analyses were performed using MeV. The
principal component analysis
(PCA) was per-
formed by eigenvalue decomposition of the three
principal components for three-dimensional classi-
ﬁcation of the samples. The data can be accessed
at GEO database GSE56597.

Clinical Data

The tumor was on the left side in 50% of the
cases. Tumor sizes were classiﬁed by the KOOS
scale as Stage 1 (intracanalicular; one case), Stage
2 (in which the largest diameter in the cerebello-
pontine angle (CPA) is 15 mm; eight cases), Stage
3 (16–30 mm in the CPA; 17 cases) or Stage 4
(>30 mm in the CPA; six cases). The tumor
appearance was homogeneous in 20 patients, het-
erogeneous in 8 and cystic in 4. The fundus of the
internal auditory canal (IAC) was involved in 22
cases and not

hematoxylin–eosin was performed for
routine
microscopic diagnosis. Antoni Type A regions con-
sisted of interwoven bundles of long bipolar spin-
dle cells, whereas Antoni Type B regions showed
a loose myxoid background containing more stel-
late tumor cells. The percentage of the various tis-
sue types (A, B, and mixed) in each tumor sample
was assessed independently by two pathologists.
The results were grouped into two types: Type A,
>70% of the tumor composed of Type A tissue;
and Type B, <70% of the tumor composed of
Type A tissue. No clinical data were available
from nonvestibular cases.

Mutational Screening of NF2 and LOH of
Chromosome Arm 22q Analysis

instructions

The NF2 gene was mutation tested by PCR/
dHPLC, as previously described (Torres-Martin
et al., 2013a). In brief, mutational screening was
performed using dHPLC following the manufac-
turer’s
(Transgenomic WAVEVR
dHPLC Systems). Samples with varying patterns
by dHPLC were sequenced bidirectionally (ABI
3100-Avant, Applied Biosystems), using the Big-
Dye sequencing kit
to
determine the position and nature of the altera-
tions. We also conducted an multiplex ligation-
dependent probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA) analysis
with SALSA P044 (MRC-Holland), which is able
to detect large gene deletions or ampliﬁcations.
The LOH analysis was performed using ﬁve
microsatellite markers at 22q11-q12.3.

RESULTS

An Overall View of Vestibular Schwannoma
Methylation Patterns Shows a Trend Toward
Hypomethylation

A total of 6553 CpG sites were hypermethylated
in vestibular schwannomas at autosomes when
they were compared with control nerves (corrected
P-value and M-value differences of at least 1).
Hypomethylation occurred in 8307 CpG sites, sug-
gesting that this alteration was more common in
the tumors. All CpG sites with differential methyl-
ation are presented in Supporting Information
Table 1. Through chromosome shredding (Table
1), we observed that hypomethylation was more
frequent in all autosomes except at chromosomes
16, 19, and 22, where hypermethylation involved
more CpG sites. Chromosomes 2, 10, 12, and 21
had greater hypomethylation among its probes.
Using genes as references for a given CpG, we

island, shore or shelf), hypermethylation appeared
more relevant on islands and slightly less so at the
shores, while
greatly
increased at island shelves and in open sea. By a
signiﬁcant margin, the open sea region had the
most alterations in terms of total numbers. The
north–south shores and shelves had similar levels
in terms of the percentage of methylated and
hypomethylated CpG sites. In relative numbers,
the islands were less affected by epigenetic
mechanisms.

Functional annotation tools for hypomethylated
regulatory regions in schwannomas using DAVID
(excluding those CpGs on gene bodies) showed
enrichment in terms of axon projection, Sema-
plexin domains, HOX sequence, apoptosis, and
Ras/rho signaling (Supporting Information Table 2).
Hypermethylated regulatory regions were enriched
in cell motility, adhesion, and cytoskeleton.

Gene Methylation Patterns

To compare the genes with altered methylated
patterns in vestibular schwannoma and controls, we
grouped the microarray probes into the six catego-
ries before use for each transcript
(TSS1500,
TSS200, 50UTR, ﬁrst exon, gene body, and
30UTR) with the IMA regionswrapper function.
Hypomethylation was more frequent than hyper-
methylation in the tumors (849 vs. 562 genes). By a
signiﬁcant margin, the region showing the largest
number of altered genes in both hypomethylation
and hypermethylation was 30UTR. The 344 hypo-
methylated genes in this 30UTR region included
MTOR, HOXD4, PAX8, and SOX8, while the 152
hypermethylated genes included SOX1, ROBO4,
and NEU4. The next region with the largest num-
ber of alterations was the gene body, with 127
hypomethylated genes including EVI2A, HOXD4,
CTNND1, and PMP2 and 106 aberrant methylated
including VSTM1, NDEL1, and ESM1.
genes
EVI2A is located within an intron of NF1, but this
gene showed no epigenetic alteration. First exon
hypomethylation was found in 75 genes (such as
PMP2, MBP, and MOG) and was similar to hyper-
methylation in 73 genes (including S100P, SOX1,
and IGF1). Region 50UTR showed the lowest num-
ber of total altered genes with 127; 60 of them dis-
played hypermethylation (e.g., HOXD3, S100B,
and HEPACAM) and 67 presented hypomethyla-
tion (e.g., APOL4 and IGF1). Finally, TSS regions
had 407 altered genes, displaying 236 hypomethy-
lated genes (such as TP63, TNF, CTNND1, and
S100A2) and 171 hypermethylated genes (including

ITGAE, FOXD2 and TFAP2A). Full results are
shown in Supporting Information Table 3.

At the single CpG level, we also searched for
genes showing several probes with aberrant meth-
ylation patterns. Since Schwann cells contribute to
the insulation of axons by myelin (a lipid cover-
ing), we searched for genes involved in myelina-
tion and lipid processes. We found a set of these
genes to be altered, including MBP, PMP2, G0S2,
FABP7, OSBPL5, CNP, APOB, and MOG. The
NF2 gene did not present any differentially meth-
ylated probe in either the vestibular or nonvestib-
ular tumors using this microarray.

We used our previously published gene expres-
sion study of vestibular schwannomas to ﬁnd altered
methylation patterns
that coincided with the
expected deregulation observed in expression
(hypermethylation underexpression or hypomethy-
lation overexpression). In both altered epigenetic
patterns, genes with these alterations were more
extensive than those with a noncanonical epigenetic
expression pattern. Given that the involvement of
the gene body and 30UTR methylation in gene
expression is controversial, we only considered
TSS1500, TSS200, 50UTR, and ﬁrst exon regions
for this purpose. The upregulated and hypomethy-
lated genes included MET, CX3CR1, HEPACAM,
PMP2,
and MERTK (Supporting Information

Table 4). The downregulated and hypermethylated
genes included CD177, MFAP5, G0S2, AQP9, and
VIT (Supporting Information Table 5).

Global HOX Genes Hypomethylation

Numerous HOX genes, which participate in
body plan development, showed a differential
methylation pattern, in most cases hypomethyla-
tion in schwannomas. The HOXD cluster, located
at chromosome 2q, showed HOXD1, HOXD3,
HOXD4, HOXD8, and HOXD9 to be clearly hypo-
methylated in 35 probes, as shown in Figure 1.
The HOXA cluster, located at chromosome 7p,
also had this pattern in a total of 27 probes in
HOXA3, HOXA4, and HOXA6. In the HOXB clus-
ter, at 17q, 15 CpG sites were hypomethylated
(including HOXB1 and HOXB3), and three were
the HOXB2
hypermethylated,
gene. Finally, cluster HOXC, at chromosome 12q,

differentially methylated in this gene; 10 of them
were hypomethylated and seven were hyperme-

expression arrays at the exon level, we previously
found an NM_138735 transcript of this gene with
no expression level changes, while NM_004801
was overexpressed in the tumors. Interestingly,
hypomethylation was found in those CpG sites

Discrepancies with Canonical Expectations in
Methylation and Expression

A set of genes presented an expression pat-
tern that was not expected from the results
obtained by methylation. An example was the
PDGFA gene, which was hypermethylated in a
single CpG at the TSS1500 promoter region and
hypomethylated in the gene body, while it was
upregulated in tumors. In the case of miR-10b
(included in the HOXD cluster), the expected
methylation and expression pattern was once
again not found. MiRNA-10b presented hypo-
methylation of 10 CpGs sites, although in the
expression study it was
found to be clearly
downregulated.

NRXN1 gene are shown. Long transcript NM_004801 shows overexpression (in red) and hypo-
methylation (in green). Transcript NM_138735 shows overexpression in probes shared with the
long isoform and no changes in expression in those probes speciﬁcally for the short form. Addi-
tionally, the methylation pattern is increased in the region belonging to the promoter region of
this isoform.

probes available for HOX genes separated vestibu-
lar and nonvestibular schwannomas as shown in
Figure 4. Thus, the methylation and expression
patterns of HOX and related genes seem to be
similar in native nerves and nonvestibular schwan-
nomas and are altered in vestibular tumors.

Clinical and Molecular Comparisons

We searched for CpG sites with differential
methylation between schwannomas by using
molecular and clinical data collected from patients
at our
institution. Sporadic vs. NF2-vestibular
schwannomas showed 123 sites with differential
methylation, including hypomethylation of DIP2C,
while WDR66, and PTPRN2 were hypermethy-
lated in 2 CpG sites each in the samples originat-
ing from NF2 patients. By tumor location (side), 1
CpG was detected. By gender, 26 probes were
found in autosomes, several of them with very low
P-values and high fold-changes, such as the TLE1
gene at 3 CpG sites, which was hypermethylated
in females. This outcome suggests that, as previ-
ously reported (Chen et al., 2013), this array might
show some degree of gender bias. However, the
low number of probes with this problem suggests
that it was not an important issue in our data. All
of the data are presented in Supporting Informa-
tion Table 6. Other clinical features tested without
any probe with aberrant methylation included the
schwannoma type (homogeneous, heterogeneous

available in Gene 1.0ST array at the exon level for HOX genes were
used in this data-reduction approach. Control nerves (white dots) and
nonvestibular schwannomas

expression than vestibular tumors (black).

Nonvestibular Schwannomas

We tested four nonvestibular schwannoma cases
with Inﬁnium microarrays and established a list of
212 CpG sites that were differentially methylated
with respect to the vestibular tumors. Of these 212
CpG sites, 88 corresponded to HOX clusters
genes, which are usually hypermethylated in non-
vestibular schwannomas. Additionally, SOX1 was
hypomethylated at 3 CpG sites in nonvestibular
schwannomas, while SOX2 (at 7 CpGs) appeared
hypermethylated with respect
vestibular
tumors. We wanted to know whether the expres-
sion patterns of HOX genes were also altered,
thus we performed an mRNA expression microar-
ray assay for those four cases. We found that, in
the exon-level expression analysis, PCA of all

4), smoking habits, presence of tinnitus prior to
surgery, tumor pressure upon the pons, dizziness
before surgery, whether the tumor reached IAC
and whether facial conduction after surgery was
less or equal at 0.05 mA. Moreover, PCA of all
samples showed no apparent association among
tumors based on their origin, as shown in Figure 5.
A mutational analysis of NF2 showed that 55%
of samples had sequence alterations, whereas rear-
rangements detected by MLPA presented in 25%
of cases, and LOH at 22q was identiﬁed in 62% of
the tumors (Supporting Information Table 7).
Overall, 75% of the samples had at least one hit
detected in the NF2 gene. Every class was tested:
sequence alteration versus not found; MLPA nor-
mal versus altered, normal constitution at 22q ver-
sus LOH; and samples with no hits in NF2 versus
at least one hit. When this last class comparison
was performed, a subset of 32 CpGs displayed
alterations. Of these, MAFK (at 7p) was hyperme-
thylated at 2 CpG sites in those tumors with no
NF2 alterations. The other classes showed no
differences.

DISCUSSION

Schwannomas are benign neoplasms that arise
from Schwann cells. Although genetic alterations
have been investigated in this neoplasm, few stud-
ies are available on the epigenetic changes in
schwannomas. In this study, we analyzed the epi-
genetic signature of individual CpG methylation
among 36 vestibular schwannomas, 4 nonvestibu-
lar schwannomas, and 5 healthy control samples of
nerve tissue using microarray technology.

CpG islands, where cytosine is more abundant,
showed a lower percentage of change via hypome-
thylation or aberrant methylation in schwannomas,
not reaching 1%. In fact, ﬂanking zones such as
CpG shores, shelves and open sea presented
increased numbers of changes (in relative levels).
Thus, differential methylation levels between
schwannomas and controls seem to increase as the
distance from CpG islands increases. Non-CpG
Island methylation, mainly at shores, has been
identiﬁed as paramount
in the regulation of
numerous genes in cell reprogramming (Doi et al.,
2009),
tissues
(Kozlenkov et al., 2014) and in cancer (Rao et al.,
2013). Overall, hypomethylation and hypermethyl-
ation levels were similar, with a trend toward
hypomethylation as previously described for colon
cancer (Irizarry et al., 2009) but in contraposition

in the classiﬁcation of various

for hepatocellular carcinoma, where methylation
was clearly biased toward hypomethylation (Shen
et al., 2013). These differences among studies
might be due to intrinsic tumor characteristics.

assay

One of the most signiﬁcant results was global
hypomethylation (with few gene exceptions) of
the four HOX gene clusters in vestibular schwan-
nomas. These genes are involved in morphological
changes and animal body plan evolution. HOX
aberrant expression in tumoral tissue compared to
control tissues (Abate-Shen 2002) has been linked
to multiples types of cancer such as pancreatic
cancer (Cantile et al., 2009), hepatocellular carci-
noma (Cillo et al., 2011), and leukemia (Argiropou-
los and Humphries 2007). This alteration has also
been identiﬁed as a prognostic factor in meningio-
mas (Di Vinci et al., 2012) and thyroid cancer
(Cantile et al., 2013). Moreover, the HOX cofactor
proteins MEIS and PBX also experienced DNA
methylation variations. Nonvestibular
schwan-
nomas displayed a different methylation proﬁle in
regard to HOX genes and cofactors, which was
more similar to that found in nerves. The PCA of
mRNA expression
distinguished
between those tumors (Fig. 4). Nonvestibular
schwannomas harbor BRAF mutations at a low
rate, but this does not occur in vestibular schwan-
nomas (de Vries et al., 2013), suggesting that there
might be speciﬁc molecular signatures between
the two neoplasms. Nonetheless, our results show
that the methylation pattern of nonvestibular and
vestibular schwannomas was very similar in the
rest of CpG sites, given that no differences were
found when the whole CpG probes were com-
pared by PCA (Fig. 5). Overall, our results suggest
that HOX genes could play an important role in
vestibular schwannomas but do not seem to be
involved in nonvestibular tumors, although the
low number of cases presented here (of nonvestib-
ular tumors) warrants additional experiments in
this regard. Thus, we propose that, based on the
numerous tumor types affected by deregulation of
HOX genes, this group of genes might be of inter-
est for a potential treatment in vestibular schwan-
noma, although it needs further study, as it is not
clear whether HOX deregulation is a cause or an
effect in carcinogenesis (Bhatlekar et al., 2014).

Gene expression changes are one of the most
studied consequences of CpG methylation. This
relationship has been highlighted in tissue speci-
ﬁcity (Lokk et al., 2014), differentiation (Liu
et al., 2014), cancer development
(Dammann
et al., 2000) and recurrence (Tsunedomi et al.,
2013). In our study, the correlations between gene

is, hypomethylated and overex-
pressed, although there was a small fraction of
genes that exhibited aberrant methylation overex-
pression or hypomethylation underexpression.
This result has also been observed in other stud-
ies, (Dayeh et al., 2014) suggesting that CpG sites
methylation, even at promoter regions (at TSS,
50UTR and ﬁrst exon) is important but not deci-
sive in gene expression. Although a single CpG
has been shown to be able to produce gene silenc-
ing (Zhang et al., 2010), we centered our wide-
methylation analysis on those genes with more
than one altered CpG.

PMEPA1 displayed seven CpG sites to be hypo-
methylated, all corresponding to promoter regions.
With mRNA overexpressed in schwannomas, this
gene regulates androgen receptor (AR) levels, which
is also downregulated in this neoplasm (Torres-Mar-
tin et al., 2013a, 2013b). Epigenetic processes in
PMEPA1 regulation have been described in prostate
cancer (Richter et al., 2007). Therefore, PMEPA1
hypomethylation might lead to its overexpression
and, as a consequence, to AR silencing. The effect
of AR downregulation in schwannomas is not clear.
A possibility might be linked to the interaction with
caveolin-1, a gene that is also downregulated in this
tumor. CAV1 has been described as an AR coactiva-
tor in prostate cancer cell lines (Wu and Terrian
2002; Bennett et al., 2014).

Another hypomethylated gene was MET onco-
gene, which presented two hypomethylated CpG
sites at the promoter region and overexpressed
mRNA. MET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that
controls various functions including proliferation
and migration. Phosphoprotein levels of MET
have been reported in schwannomas, indicating
that it is present in tumors (Boin et al., 2014).
MET expression linked to promoter epigenetic
regulation has been described in other oncogenic
processes such as the metastasis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (Ogunwobi et al., 2013). Thus, MET
gene mRNA overexpression might occur
in
schwannomas through epigenetic mechanisms.

Schwannomas showed a set of genes related to
myelination processes with altered epigenetic signa-
tures, including MBP and PMP2. Changes in these
genes were also found in an immunohistochemistry
study (Hung et al., 2002) and expression analysis
(Torres-Martin et al., 2013a, 2013b). In the latter
study, a developmental state between the neural
crest and Schwann cell precursor was suggested.
Thus, methylation seems to play an important
role in processes related to myelin formation in

changes leading to dedifferentiation. Based on our
data, the NF2 gene does not seem to be affected by
methylation processes in schwannomas, in agree-
ment with Koutsimpelas et al., (2012) and Lee et al.,
(2012), although methylation in a small subset of
samples should not be ruled out (Gonzalez-Gomez
et al., 2003; Kullar et al., 2010). Additionally, the
NF1 gene, which is involved in neuroﬁbromatosis
Type 1 (NF1) syndrome, contains a small gene
within an intron named EVI2A. In 2 EVI2A CpG
sites, hypomethylation was detected. This ﬁnding
agrees with the overexpression of EVI2A found in
schwannomas (Torres-Martin et al., 2013a, 2013b)
and with that described in head and neck cancer
(Poage et al., 2011). Thus, there might be a con-
nection between both neuroﬁbromatosis types
(NF1 and NF2) via this gene; however, the mech-
anism remains elusive.

MiRNAs presented changes in DNA methyla-
tion pattern at the promoter and body regions.
Numerous epigenetic mechanisms that modify the
expression level of these small molecules have
been found (Lopez-Serra and Esteller 2012). Fur-
thermore, miRNAs are epigenetically altered in
tumors such as oral cancer (Kozaki et al., 2008),
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Agirre et al., 2009),
colorectal carcinogenesis (Balaguer et al., 2010),
and hepatocellular carcinoma (Furuta et al., 2010).
In our tumor series, miR-21 was hypomethylated
in 5 CpG sites, three of which corresponded to
promoter regions. As expected, miR-21 expression
level was found to be clearly upregulated, in the
same manner as other tumors, such as hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma (Xu et al., 2013) and gastric cancer
(Zhang et al., 2012). Conversely, miRNA-199a1
was
downregulated.
MiRNA-199a1 targets MET (Kim et al., 2008) and
thus the downregulation of this miRNA could par-
ticipate in MET overexpression. Additionally,
despite having several hypomethylated CpG sites,
several miRNAs exhibited downregulation. This
process was very pronounced in miR-10b, with 10
CpG sites hypomethylated and with a clear down-
regulation in schwannomas. Given that eight of
these CpG are located within the HOXD4 gene,
there might be other mechanisms leading to this
transcript downregulation. MiRNA hypomethyla-
tion and underexpression has also been previously
reported (Liu et al., 2014),
suggesting that,
although CpG methylation at miRNAs genes usu-
ally follows the expected pattern of action, this
phenomenon is not completely able to predict the
behavior of a particular miRNA.

Currently, body methylation does not have an
obvious role in gene expression. Proposed models
include a reduction of transcriptional noise (Huh
et al., 2013), alternative splicing (Maunakea et al.,
2010) and even transcription regulation but in a
different manner than in promoters, with overex-
pressed and underexpressed genes having moder-
ate methylation levels (Su et al., 2014). In our
study, we detected various transcripts belonging to
the same gene but not showing the same methyla-
tion pattern. Thus, we found neurexin-1 with
hypomethylation and hypermethylation of distinct
transcripts, as conﬁrmed by mRNA expression.
This gene, which is able to generate hundreds of
alternative transcripts (Ushkaryov et al., 1992), is
involved in the formation of synapses and in the
vascular system (Melani and Weinstein 2010).
Therefore, based on the speciﬁc methylation pat-
tern of various isoforms, the picture of methylation
expression in schwannomas signiﬁcantly increases
in complexity, because changes in methylation
would not only be limited to changes in the
expression of a speciﬁc gene but also in a subtle
regulation of alternative transcripts, as described
in human colon cancer for the VEGF gene (Ham-
dollah Zadeh et al. 2014). The consequences of
this fact might be of great importance, as treat-
ment options could not only be limited to the
silencing of an aberrant expressed gene, but to
restoring the levels of the nonpathological isoform.
In agreement with our previous expression anal-
ysis, we found no signiﬁcant differences between
regarding clinical or
vestibular
molecular
in an epigenetic context.
Nevertheless, a small subset of CpG sites were
identiﬁed and could be a signature of certain sub-
types, such as hypermethylated MAFK at 2 CpG
sites in those vestibular schwannomas with no
detected NF2 hits.

region,

In conclusion, schwannoma CpG site-speciﬁc
signatures compared to nontumoral nerves show a
trend toward hypomethylation. CpG islands seem
to be less involved in epigenetic changes than
shores,
and open sea. Furthermore,
expression levels were altered in several genes
where hypo or hypermethylation was present at
including MET and
the
PMEPA1. Moreover, we have identiﬁed a possible
mechanism of expression in alternative transcripts
in neurexin-1. We also report that EVI2A (located
at the NF1 gene intron) might be upregulated in
tumors by hypomethylation. Finally, we detected
HOX gene cluster global hypomethylation in ves-
tibular schwannoma, but no changes in these

promoter

genes were found in nonvestibular tumor cases,
suggesting that
treatment options for schwan-
nomas from a variety of places might require dif-
ferent approaches.
