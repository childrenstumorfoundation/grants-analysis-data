Ras proteins are critical nodes in cellular
signaling that integrate inputs from acti-
vated cell surface receptors and other
stimuli to modulate cell fate through a
complex network of effector pathways.
Oncogenic RAS mutations are found
in ⬃ 25% of human cancers and are highly
prevalent in hematopoietic malignancies.
Because of their structural and biochemi-
Introduction

cal properties, oncogenic Ras proteins
are exceedingly difﬁcult targets for ratio-
nal drug discovery, and no mechanism-
based therapies exist for cancers with
RAS mutations. This article reviews the
properties of normal and oncogenic Ras
proteins, the prevalence and likely patho-
genic role of NRAS, KRAS, and NF1 muta-
tions in hematopoietic malignancies, rel-

evant animal models of these cancers,
and implications for drug discovery. Be-
cause hematologic malignancies are ex-
perimentally tractable, they are especially
valuable platforms for addressing the fun-
damental question of how to reverse the
adverse biochemical output of oncogenic
Ras in cancer.
(Blood. 2012;120(17):
3397-3406)

Aberrant signal transduction resulting in reduced dependence on
growth factors and other extracellular stimuli for the survival and
proliferation of malignant cells is an established “hallmark of
cancer.”1 RAS genes encode a family of 21-kDa proteins that are
central nodes in signaling networks that regulate cell fate in many
tissue lineages. RAS genes are also the most common targets of
dominant somatic mutations in human cancer.2,3 The high preva-
lence of mutations in NRAS, KRAS, and molecules, such as CKIT,
PTPN11, CBL, and BCR-ABL1, that interact with Ras biochemi-
cally strongly implicate aberrant Ras signaling as an important
therapeutic target in these cancers.4-7 In this review, we focus on the
pathobiology of mutations in hematologic cancers involving the
“core” Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex, which
includes Ras itself, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and
GAPs. At this writing, mutations in NRAS, KRAS, and the NF1
tumor suppressor, which encodes a GAP called neuroﬁbromin,8 are
strongly associated with myeloid malignancies. Increasing evi-
dence also implicates these genes as “drivers” in lymphoid cancers
with “high-risk” clinical features. No mechanism-based treatments
exist for the ⬃ 25% of human cancers with KRAS or NRAS
mutations or for the growing number of malignancies showing NF1
inactivation, and we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for
addressing the adverse biochemical consequences of aberrant Ras
signaling.

Structural and functional properties of the
Ras GTPase switch

Ras proteins are signal switch molecules that regulate cell fates by
cycling between active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–bound and
inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–bound conformations.9 On
ligand binding, molecules, such as Shc, Grb2, Gab2, and SHP-2,
are recruited to growth factor receptors and these complexes

activate Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; Figure
1).10 GEFs catalyze dissociation of guanine nucleotides from Ras,
which is followed by passive rebinding. Because the concentration
of free GTP in cells vastly exceeds that of GDP, GEF-induced
nucleotide exchange increases Ras-GTP levels.10 Ras can be
activated by a number of different GEFs in mammalian cells,
including SOS1 and SOS2, RasGRFS1 and RasGRFS2, and
RasGRP1 to RasGRP4 (Figure 1).2

GTP binding stabilizes the switch I and switch II domains of
Ras, which then interacts productively with effectors.9 These
effector molecules are activated biochemically through complex
mechanisms that involve recruitment to discrete subcellular com-
partments, increasing intrinsic catalytic activity and/or inducing
conformational changes that allow effectors to act as scaffolds for
the assembly of signaling complexes.11,12 Three canonical Ras
effectors have been the focus of intense study: PI3-kinase (PI3K),
Raf, and Ral-GDS proteins (Figure 1). Of these, aberrant activation
of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade is
most strongly implicated in malignant transformation and tumor
maintenance. We refer interested readers to detailed reviews of
individual effector pathways.2,13

Signaling is terminated when Ras-GTP is hydrolyzed to Ras-
GDP. This “off” reaction is catalyzed by intrinsic Ras GTPase
activity, which is inefﬁcient in the absence of GAPs. GAPs bind to
the switch domains of Ras-GTP and insert an “arginine ﬁnger” into
the phosphate binding loop of Ras that stabilizes a transition state
between Ras-GTP and Ras-GDP.2,8 Because GAPs accelerate GTP
hydrolysis thousands of fold, some view the Ras-GTPase as
enzyme complex composed of Ras and a GAP. Neuroﬁbromin, the
protein encoded by NF1, and p120 GAP are the predominant Ras
GAPs in mammalian cells, and both are expressed broadly.8,14
Given the central role of Ras signaling in cellular homeostasis, it is
perhaps not surprising that germline mutations in NF1 and other
genes that regulate Ras-GTP levels also cause developmental
disorders.2,10

Figure 1. The Ras switch. Ras proteins are switches
that relay signals initiated when transmembrane recep-
tors bind ligand. Activated receptors recruit GEFs by
assembly of multiprotein complexes (eg, including SOS)
or more indirectly, by evoking lipid modiﬁcations that
recruit GEFs, such as RasGRPs, to cytosolic membrane
surfaces. GEFs promote exchange of GDP for GTP on
Ras. When bound to GTP, Ras adopts a conformation in
which the “switch” regions are stabilized and can interact
productively with various downstream effectors. Thus,
Ras connects extracellular stimuli to intracellular net-
works that compute and execute cell fate decisions. The
Ras signal
is terminated by GTP hydrolysis, which is
largley dependent on GAPs, such as neuroﬁbromin
(NF1) or p120 RasGAP.

Structural properties of oncogenic Ras
proteins and therapeutic implications

RAS genes encode 4 highly homologous proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras,
K-Ras4a, and K-Ras4b) that are identical in the ﬁrst 85 amino
acids. This “G” domain includes the P-loop, which interacts with
the ␥-phosphate of GTP, and the switch regions (Figure 2).2,10 Ras
proteins share 85% identity over the next 80 amino acids and only
diverge substantially at
the C-terminal “hypervariable region”
(Figure 2).2 The hypervariable region of all Ras isoforms termi-
nates with a CAAX motif, where the cysteine is prenylated by
farnesyltransferase (FTase). After prenylation, the —AAX of the
CAAX motif is removed by Ras-converting enzyme 1, and the
carboxyl group of the newly exposed isoprenylcysteine is methyl-
ated by isoprenylcysteine-carboxyl-methyltransferase (ICMT).
These lipid modiﬁcations provide weak membrane binding afﬁnity
that is stabilized by a second signal motif. For K-Ras4b, this is
provided by a polybasic lysine domain, which interacts strongly
with the phospholipid membrane. By contrast, H-, N-, and K-Ras4a
are palmitoylated at cysteine(s) adjacent
to the CAAX motif
(Figure 2). These modiﬁcations are essential for correct trafﬁcking
and subcellular localization of each isoform.15 In particular,
whereas H-, N-, and K-Ras4a are directed from the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) to the Golgi en route to the plasma membrane (PM),
K-Ras4b localizes directly to the PM through an unknown mecha-
nism. A signiﬁcant portion of H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a reside
and signal in the Golgi and ER, and these proteins trafﬁc between
the Golgi, ER, and PM in a dynamic cycle that is regulated by
depalmitoylation and repalmitoylation.15 Depalmitoylation is medi-
ated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 and acyl protein thioesterase 2.15
By contrast, there are at least 20 palmitoyl transferases, and it is
uncertain which of these act on individual Ras proteins.16 Perturba-
tion of palmitate turnover leads to nonspeciﬁc distribution of
H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a to endomembranes and decreases
signaling from the PM.17

Somatic point mutations of RAS genes at codons 12, 13, and 61 are
the most common dominant oncogenic lesions in human cancer.2
Substitutions in these residues favor the GTP-bound conformation
because of reduced intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and resistance to
GAPs.2 The oncogenic Ras/GAP switch is an exceedingly difﬁcult
target for rational drug discovery. The most tractable molecular
targets in cancer, such as BCR-ABL, the mutant epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), and B-RafV600E, are aberrantly activated
kinases that are inhibited by selective small-molecule inhibitors.
By contrast, oncogenic Ras proteins have reduced GTPase activ-
ity.2 Restoring enzymatic function, the fundamental biochemical
problem posed by oncogenic Ras,
is extremely challenging.
Developing mechanism-based inhibitors of oncogenic Ras is
further complicated by the picomolar afﬁnity of Ras for GTP and
by high intracellular GTP concentrations.18 Finally, the P loop of
Ras is structurally constrained, with any amino acid substitution at
glycines 12 or 13 introducing space-occupying side chains that
distort
to
envision how small molecules might bind to Ras and restore
GAP-mediated GTP catalysis. For these reasons, recent drug
discovery efforts have largely focused on inhibiting kinase compo-
nents of downstream effector pathways, such as PI3K, Akt,
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and MEK.

NRAS, KRAS, and NF1 mutations in
hematologic cancers

Different RAS genes are preferentially mutated in distinct tumor
types, with KRAS mutations highly prevalent in common epithelial
malignancies.2 As summarized in the next 5 sections and in Table 1,
hematologic cancers are unusual in that NRAS and KRAS are both

Figure 2. Ras processing and trafﬁcking to subcellu-
lar compartments. H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4a, and
K-Ras4b proteins are identical in the ﬁrst 85 amino acids,
a region that includes the P loop (phosphate binding loop,
amino acids 10-16), which binds the ␥-phosphate of GTP,
and the switch I (amino acids 30-38) and switch II (amino
acids 60-76) regions, which regulate binding to Ras
regulators and effectors. The next 78 amino acids
show ⬃ 85%-90% sequence homology. Amino acids that
are shared by all isoforms are depicted in light gray, those
that differ are depicted in dark gray. The ﬁnal 24 (23 for
K-Ras4b) amino acids, called the hypervariable region
(HVR), specify posttranslational modiﬁcations and trafﬁck-
ing for each Ras isoform. All 4 isoforms have a C-terminal
—CAAX motif, which is farnesylated (F) by FTase. The
—AAX is removed by Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1)
and the cysteine methylated (M) by ICMT. K-Ras4b is
then shuttled directly to the PM where it is stabilized by its
polylysine domain (KKKKKK). The other 3 isoforms are
shuttled to the Golgi apparatus, where they are palmitoy-
lated (P) at one or more cysteines near the C-terminus
before reaching the plasma membrane. On the mem-
brane, H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a can be depalmitoy-
lated by acyl protein thioesterases 1 and 2 (APT1/APT2),
directing them back to the Golgi. This palmitoylation-
depalmitoylation, Golgi-plasma membrane cycle contin-
ues in a delicate balance until the proteins are degraded.

mutated at signiﬁcant frequencies, with NRAS mutations predomi-
nating. NF1 is the only Ras GAP implicated in tumorigenesis to
date. Although mutations in Ras GEFs have been linked to the
development of drug resistance in mouse models of hematologic
malignancies,19 other mutations in this family of molecules are rare
in human cancers (COSMIC database).

JMML and CMML

These aggressive myeloid malignancies are classiﬁed as myelodys-
plastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasia (MDS/MPN) “over-
lap” syndromes by the World Health Organization. A distinctive
pattern of hypersensitive CFU-GM progenitor growth in methylcel-
lulose cultures containing GM-CSF is a cellular hallmark of

juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) that is also observed
in some cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).20

The association between neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and
JMML pointed the way toward our current understanding of the
underlying molecular pathogenesis.20 Genetic analysis of JMML
bone marrow specimens from children with NF1 revealed somatic
loss of the normal NF1 allele, elevated levels of Ras-GTP, and
activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK effector pathway.20 Sequencing
revealed NF1 mutations in ⬃ 15% of patients with JMML, suggest-
ing that other genes involved in Ras signaling might also be
mutated. Indeed, molecular analysis demonstrating somatic NRAS
and KRAS in 25%-30% of JMML patients, and subsequent research
identifying PTPN11 and CBL mutations ﬁrmly established JMML
as a disease of hyperactive Ras.20 Furthermore, the observation that
children with NF1 and certain other developmental disorders are
predisposed to JMML provided strong evidence that hyperactive
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling initiates this disease.2

NRAS and CBL mutations are highly prevalent in CMML.4,21
Whereas RAS mutations are found in ⬎ 20% of patients with the
myeloproliferative variant of CMML, they are rare in the more benign
myelodysplastic variant.22,23 It is uncertain whether hyperactive Ras
signaling can initiate leukemogenesis in CMML or whether mutations
in genes that are involved in epigenetic programming are also re-
quired.24 However, there is some evidence to support the role of
cooperation between hyperactive Ras signaling and transcription factor
mutations in acute transformation of CMML.25

AML

and KRAS mutations in an additional 5%.26,27 A similar incidence of
NRAS/KRAS mutations is observed in pediatric patients.28,29 NRAS/
KRAS mutations do not have independent prognostic signiﬁcance
in patients treated with current antileukemia regimens, although
patients with AML harboring a RAS mutation may respond better to
high-dose cytarabine as post-remission therapy.30 Recently, high-
throughput sequencing revealed novel NRAS and KRAS mutations
in AML and CMML that introduce substitutions at amino acids
14, 60, 74, and 146 in 2%-5% of cases.31 This discovery suggests
that 20%-25% of AML carries somatic NRAS/KRAS mutations.
Loss of NF1 expression was reported in 7 of 95 patients with AML,
and 7 additional cases had heterozygous NF1 loss.32

Observations in JMML and CMML and studies of genetically
engineered mice summarized in “Insights from mouse models”
provide compelling evidence that NF1, NRAS, and KRAS mutations
are early or initiating events in some myeloid malignancies,
particularly MDS/MPN overlap disorders. The picture is more
complex in AML, with existing data suggesting that these muta-
tions may function as either early/initiating or as cooperating
mutations that are acquired during disease progression. RAS and
NF1 mutations are over-represented in the French-American-
British (FAB) M4 and M5 monocytic subtypes, with an overall
incidence of ⬎ 30%.26,27,32 Interestingly, JMML and CMML also
evolve to M4/M5 AML,31,33 and leukemia cells from patients with
JMML, CMML, and FAB M4/M5 AML exhibit a similar signature
of phospho-protein activation characterized by aberrant STAT5
activation at low GM-CSF concentrations.34 Together with the
absence of consistent transcription factor mutations in FAB M4/M5
AML, these data raise the possibility that M4/M5 AML, JMML,
and CMML are related malignancies in which NRAS/KRAS/NF1
play an early and essential role in leukemic growth.34,35

A popular model suggests that initiation of AML requires both a
“class 1” mutation that aberrantly activates signal transduction and
a “class 2” mutation in a transcription factor.36 Recent studies
demonstrating a high frequency of heterozygous and homozygous
mutations in genes that broadly regulate the eipgenome, such as
TET2, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, and DNMT3A, and other lines of
evidence indicate that this simple paradigm only partially explains
the complex pathogenesis of AML.37 However, it is useful for
considering the potential role of NRAS/KRAS/NF1 mutations as
cooperating events in leukemogenesis. The observation that activat-
ing mutations in FLT3 and CKIT, which encode receptor tyrosine
kinases upstream of Ras, are common in AML and largely conﬁned
to cases without RAS mutations supports the broad relevance of
“class 1” mutations in AML. Furthermore, several groups have
shown that RAS and FLT3 mutations can be lost or gained during
disease evolution in AML and MDS.38,39 Indeed, cases with an
NRAS mutation at diagnosis may demonstrate a FLT3 mutation at
relapse (and vice versa), and NRAS mutations are associated with
acquired resistance to Flt3 kinase inhibitors in vitro.40 These
studies are consistent with the idea that mutations that alter
signaling molecules are secondary events that contribute to clonal
evolution in many patients with AML.

MDS/MPNs

Initial studies demonstrating somatic NRAS mutations in 20%-40%
of MDS included patients with CMML, which undoubtedly
inﬂated these numbers. Recent data indicate that NRAS is mutated
in ⬃ 5% of MDS where it is associated with adverse clinical
features and a high risk of transformation to AML.41,42 KRAS
mutations are rare in MDS.42 Although there are limited data on
somatic NF1 inactivation in MDS, recurrent cryptic changes or

deletions involving the NF1 locus were identiﬁed in 3 of
35 patients.43 Mutations in BRAF, PTPN11, CBL, FLT3, CKIT, and
other genes encoding signaling molecules that interact with Ras are
also uncommon in MDS.44 Taken together, although the existing data do
not support an integral role of NRAS/KRAS/NF1 mutations in the
development of MDS, they probably contribute to transformation to
AML. By contrast, mutations that deregulate signaling networks are
integral to the pathogenesis of MPN and NRAS/KRAS/NF1 muta-
tions are therefore not implicated in progression to acute leukemia.45

ALL

There are limited data regarding RAS mutations in lymphoid
malignancies, particularly in adults. One small study suggested
that ⬃ 11% of adult T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL) patients harbor RAS mutations.46 Neri et al identiﬁed RAS
mutations in 6 of 33 ALL cases (18%), all of which were in codon
12 or 13 of NRAS, although patient age was not reported.47 In the
pediatric literature, estimates of RAS mutation frequency in both B-
and T-lineage ALL approximate 15%, with NRAS mutations
predominating.48,49

Early T-cell precursor ALL is a recently identiﬁed subtype of
pediatric ALL with a distinct gene expression proﬁle and an
immunophenotype notable for expression of stem cell and myeloid
markers.50 Children with this form of leukemia have high rates of
induction failure, as well as extremely high risk of relapse.50
Whole-genome sequencing recently uncovered mutations in genes
involved in Ras signaling in 67% of early T-cell precursor ALL
cases (19% NRAS , 3%KRAS, 14% FLT3, and the remainder in
JAK1, JAK3, BRAF, and IGFR1).48 These data suggest that early
T-cell precursor ALL may be initiated by NRAS/KRAS and other
“driver” mutations that are commonly identiﬁed in myeloid malignan-
cies in a multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell. Somatic NF1
mutations were also reported recently in some human T-ALLs.51

MM

RAS is the single most commonly mutated gene family in multiple
myeloma (MM).52 Whereas early publications estimated the fre-
quency of NRAS/KRAS mutations in MM as high as 30%-40%,53-55
a comprehensive recent study identiﬁed codon 12, 13, or 61 RAS
mutations in 23% of 529 patients.52 Of these, two-thirds were in the
NRAS gene (mostly in codon 61), with the remainder in KRAS
(largely in codons 12 and 13). RAS mutations predict shorter
overall survival and progression-free survival in MM, but are rare
in monoclonal gammopathy of unknown signiﬁcance, a precursor
to MM in some patients.52,53 Furthermore, as in AML, RAS gene
mutations are occasionally not detected at diagnosis but found at
relapse. Although not deﬁnitive, these data suggest that NRAS/
KRAS mutations are more likely to be involved in MM progression
rather than initiation.52,53,55

Insights from mouse models

Ras oncogenes have been studied extensively in the mouse, both to
elucidate the mechanisms underlying deregulated growth and to
develop robust in vivo platforms for performing preclinical trials.
Table 2 presents a partial list of informative models of hematologic
malignancies. One strong theme that has emerged is that either
inactivating Nf1 or expressing oncogenic Kras from its endogenous
genetic locus in the hematopoietic compartment is sufﬁcient to
produce a myeloproliferative disorder that models human MDS/

MPN. This highly penetrant phenotype progresses rapidly in
Mx1-Cre; KrasG12D mice.35,56 Interestingly, similar models based
on endogenous NrasG12D expression demonstrated a mild and
variable myeloid phenotype,57-59 although mice that are homozy-
gous for a conditional NrasG12D knock-in allele consistently
develop aggressive MPN.59,60 Together, these data support the idea
that differences in the structure and/or expression levels of different
Ras isoforms inﬂuence the severity of myeloid growth dysregula-
tion, which may have implications for therapeutic development.

Although the role of Ras pathway activation has been more
thoroughly described in the development of myeloid disease,
growing evidence implicates hyperactive Ras in the development
of lymphoid cancers as well. Lymphoid transformation was
observed in early studies of primary hematopoietic cells expressing
mutant Ras,61 and spontaneous T-ALL is a common ﬁnding in
transgenic mouse models bearing Ras oncogenes.62-64 In retrospect,
such studies predicted the presence of Ras pathway mutations in
human lymphoid leukemia (see “ALL”). T-ALL can be induced in
KrasG12D mice by transplanting limiting numbers of hematopoietic
stem cells into irradiated recipients or by retroviral insertional
mutagenesis.65-67 Mutations leading to Notch1 activation are com-
mon in this setting, and strong synergy exists between these
2 human leukemia oncogenes.68

It is probable that additional mutations contribute to leukemic
outgrowth initiated by oncogenic Ras or Nf1 inactivation in other
contexts. Bone marrow transduced with retroviral vectors encoding
oncogenic Kras or Nras can cause AML in recipient mice after
transplantation, and these cancers exhibit clonal
retroviral
integrations.69-71 Retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Nf1, Kras,
and Nras mutant mice was deployed as a forward genetic strategy
to identify mutations that might cooperate with hyperactive Ras in
leukemogenesis.19,58,66 These studies implicated Evi1, Myb, Sox4,
and Gﬁ1 in AML initiated by Nras or Nf1 inactivation, and Ikzf1 in
Kras mutant mice with T-ALL. Consistent with reports of therapy-
induced hematologic cancers in patients with NF1, heterozygous
Nf1 inactivation cooperates with radiation to induce MDS and
MPN in mice.72,73

Hematopoietic cells that either express endogenous levels of
oncogenic NrasG12D or KrasG12D or have inactivated Nf1 demon-
strate a hypersensitive pattern of CFU-GM progenitor colony
growth in response to GM-CSF that recapitulates what is observed
in JMML and in some patients with CMML.20,35,58,74 Consistent
with in vivo observations, this cellular phenotype is most pro-

nounced in cells from Mx1-Cre; KrasG12D/⫹ and homozygous
Mx1-Cre; NrasG12D/G12D mice, but relatively subtle in Mx1-Cre;
NrasG12D/⫹ and Mx1-Cre; Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox cells. Whereas biochemical
analysis of bone marrow cells from these mutant mice revealed
elevated basal levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK), the degree of
activation was unexpectedly subtle and bone marrow cells mark-
edly increased pERK levels in response to growth factor stimula-
tion.35,59,60,74,75 Detailed biochemical proﬁling of Nf1 and Nras
mutant AMLs has not been reported. Interestingly, however,
although T-ALL cells from Kras mutant mice have constitutively
high Ras-GTP levels, pERK, pAkt, and pS6 levels were highly
variable.66 Together, biochemical studies of mouse leukemias
support the idea that primary hematopoietic cells dynamically
modulate signaling networks in response to increased Ras-GTP
levels, which has implications for the use of targeted therapeutics.

Therapeutic strategies for inhibiting Ras
processing and activation

Inhibiting posttranslational processing of Ras engendered intense
interest
in the 1990s. Drug discovery efforts focused on the
essential lipid modiﬁcation at CAAX sequence that is catalyzed by
FTase.76 Clinical trials of selective and potent FTase inhibitors
were largely disappointing,76,77 probably because K-Ras and N-Ras
undergo lipid modiﬁcation via geranylgeranyl transferase when
FTase is inhibited and therefore retain biologic activity.76 Indeed, a
preclinical trial of the FTase inhibitor L744,832 in mice that
developed MPN after adoptive transfer of Nf1-deﬁcient hematopoi-
etic cells revealed no inhibition of K- or N-Ras processing at the
maximally tolerated dose and no improvement in leukocyte counts
or splenomegaly.78 Off-target effects may explain the clinical
responses to FTase inhibitors reported in some leukemias.77,79
Unfortunately, combining FTase and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibi-
tion proved too toxic to represent a viable therapeutic regimen.76

Genetic studies in mice investigated the effects of interfering
with C-terminal processing of prenylated Ras proteins by Ras-
converting enzyme 1 and ICMT. Inactivating Rce1 in hematopoi-
etic cells unexpectedly accelerated MPN in the Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
model of JMML/CMML.80 By contrast, conditional inactivation of
Icmt attenuated myeloproliferation in this strain and also dramati-
cally reduced growth-factor independent colony growth in vitro.81
Although the opposite effects of Rce1 and Icmt inactivation on

KrasG12D-induced myeloid disease are perplexing, it should be
recalled that these enzymes catalyze the posttranslational modiﬁcation
of many other cellular proteins that could modulate the phenotype.
Small molecules have been identiﬁed that block ICMT activity;
however, these compounds have not yet been tested in vivo.82

The palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle is a potential thera-
peutic target for selectively inhibiting the growth of hematologic
cancers with NRAS mutations (Figure 2). A recent study reported
that mutating the palmitoylation site at cysteine 181 to serine
(C181S) in N-RasG12D inhibited plasma membrane localization in
ﬁbroblasts and prevented the development of myeloid disease in a
retroviral transduction/transplantation model of MPN.83 Xu et al
found that the C181S mutation exhibited dominant negative activity on
myeloid progenitor growth and ERK activation, probably by sequester-
ing effectors.60 Palmostatin B is a novel APT inhibitor that causes
entropy-driven diffusion of H-Ras and N-Ras throughout the cell.84
Exposing transduced hematopoietic cells from Nras and Kras mutant
mice to palmostatin B mislocalized N-RasG12D away from the
plasma membrane and reduced CFU-GM and AML blast colony
growth. Importantly, this inhibition was selective for Nras mutant
cells and mapped to the hypervariable region. Together, these
studies identify APT inhibitors as a novel class of potential therapeutics
in hematologic malignancies with NRAS mutations. Newer and more
potent inhibitors in this chemical series were reported recently, although
systemic toxicities have not been fully described.85

Blocking growth-promoting signals that converge to activate
GEFs is another potential therapeutic strategy for treating cancers
characterized by NRAS/KRAS/NF1 mutations. In the case of
oncogenic Ras, this raises the question of whether these proteins
are truly “constitutively active” or remain dependent on guanine
nucleotide exchange for transforming activity. The answer is not
known and may depend, at least in part, on cell context and on the
nature of the underlying RAS mutation. However, there is some
evidence that the mutant Ras/GAP switch is at least partially
dependent on growth factor signaling in hematopoietic cells. This
dependence is clearest in Nf1-deﬁcient cells where genetic ablation
of either Gmcsf or the ␤-common chain of the GM-CSF receptor
markedly attenuates the JMML-like MPN.86,87 Interestingly, pri-
mary hematopoietic cells from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice show little
basal activation of Raf/MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt/S6 signaling, and
these pathways respond robustly to growth factor stimulation.35,88
It is unclear exactly how upstream inputs promote growth of cells
expressing mutant Ras proteins, but the rapid development of AML
in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice after Nf1 deletion implies that Ras-GTP
levels may be limiting.89 Together, these observations suggest that
interfering with growth factor-mediated Ras activation may be
beneﬁcial, at least in principle, in some cancers with RAS or NF1
mutations. Along these lines, Maurer et al18 recently identiﬁed
chemical inhibitors to a novel binding pocket on the surface of Ras.
DCA1, a compound from this screen, inhibits Ras activation by
interfering with SOS-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange, and
probably also has activity against other exchange factors.18 Al-
though the long-term therapeutic potential of this approach is
uncertain, treatment with drugs that block “upstream” proteins
might be considered in hematologic cancers with NRAS/KRAS/NF1
mutations that respond to growth factor stimulation.

Targeting Ras effector pathways

introducing additional complexity. It

tors of oncogenic Ras are “indirect” targets that are activated by the
mutant protein,
is now
appreciated that oncoprotein expression elicits compensatory re-
sponses with unpredictable consequences for downstream path-
ways. For example, whereas T-ALLs generated by insertional
mutagenesis in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice invariably show elevated
levels of Ras-GTP, the activation of effectors, such as ERK, Akt,
and S6, is highly variable in independent leukemias.66

Although evidence is limited regarding which Ras effector
pathways are essential for tumor initiation and which are required
for maintenance in vivo, the spectrum of non-RAS mutations offers
some insights. Whereas mutations that alter Ras-activated proteins
are uncommon in JMML, CMML, and AML, “upstream” genes,
such as FLT3, CKIT, CBL, and PTPN11, are frequently mutated in
these cancers, suggesting that deregulation of multiple effector
pathways is essential for myeloid transformation. By contrast,
mutational analysis strongly implicates the PI3K pathway in
T-ALL,90 and the recent discovery of activating BRAF mutations
in ⬃ 4% of MM91 suggests that aberrant Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
is an important consequence of RAS mutations in this cancer.

Given the uncertainty regarding which Ras effector(s) are
essential for the survival and proliferation of different hematopoi-
etic cancers, evaluating targeted inhibitors in preclinical and
clinical trials that include pharmacodynamic monitoring of bio-
chemical endpoints can provide pathogenic as well as clinical
insights. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with activity against
Raf proteins, had promising single-agent efﬁcacy in AML with
FLT3 mutations in a phase 1 trial.92 However, this may be the result
of non-Raf effects, as sorafenib also inhibits Flt3 and other
kinases.93 More potent and selective Flt3 inhibitors have shown
great promise in AML94 and will certainly supersede sorafenib for
directly targeting this mutant protein.

CI-1040 and PD0325901 are allosteric MEK inhibitors that
have been evaluated in preclinical models of JMML/CMML,
AML, and T-ALL.19,66,95 Whereas CI-1040 was ineffective in
Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice with MPN,19 PD0325901 induced dra-
matic hematologic improvement and greatly prolonged survival in
the Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D model of JMML/CMML.95 These differen-
tial effects may reﬂect the short duration of in vivo MEK inhibition
in the bone marrow cells of mice treated with CI-1040 (⬃ 4 hours)
versus prolonged effects of PD0325901.19 The beneﬁcial effects of
PD0325901 in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice were associated with
persistence of Kras mutant cells.95 These observations imply that
treatment modulates the biologic behavior of these cells and suggest that
it will be important to assess molecular markers of the malignant clone
in clinical trials of MEK inhibition in JMML and CMML.

it

MEK inhibitors were also tested in insertional mutagenesis
models of AML initiated by Nf1 inactivation19 and of T-ALL
characterized by oncogenic KrasG12D expression.66 Although CI-
1040 had no beneﬁcial therapeutic index in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice with MPN,
induced dramatic disease regression and
markedly extended survival in recipients transplanted with primary
Nf1-deﬁcient AMLs.19 This suggests that cooperating mutations
acquired during progression from MPN to AML rendered these
aggressive cancers more dependent on Raf/MEK/ERK signaling.
All of these mice that initially responded to MEK inhibition
ultimately relapsed despite continued treatment. Genetic analysis
revealed the emergence of preexisting drug-resistant clones, under-
scoring the importance of genetic heterogeneity as a cause of
resistance to targeted inhibitors.

Intensive effort has focused on developing small-molecule inhibi-
tors of the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascades. Effec-

“First-generation” MEK inhibitors demonstrated efﬁcacy against

TARGETING RAS IN HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES

tumors.96 Based on these disappointing data and
RAS-mutant
unexpected ocular toxicity, clinical development of CI-1040 and
PD0325901 was suspended. Newer MEK inhibitors appear to have
less toxicity and greater efﬁcacy against solid tumors harboring
RAS mutations. However, it is uncertain whether they are superior
to standard therapies, and a recent phase 2 study of the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 in advanced AML showed only modest and
transient antitumor activity.97 PI3K signaling is activated in AML
blasts, and PI3K inhibitors demonstrated antiproliferative activity
in vitro. Although there are a number of PI3K inhibitors in clinical
trials for solid tumors, none has yet been tested in humans with
hematologic malignancies.

One potential explanation for lack of efﬁcacy of single-agent
PI3K/Akt or Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition in RAS-mutant cancers
tumors may be the ability of either pathway to overcome inhibition
of the other through the release of negative feedback loops or other
mechanisms. This provides a rationale for simultaneously inhibit-
ing both major effector pathways in RAS-mutant malignancies.
Studies demonstrating synergistic antitumor effects of combining
MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition in genetically engineered murine
solid tumor models supports this general strategy. Finally, other Ras
effectors in addition to PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK may promote
tumor formation and/or maintenance in human malignancies and could
also represent potential avenues for acquiring drug resistance.

Identifying synthetic lethal interactions with
oncogenic Ras

Performing RNA interference (RNAi) screens to identify “syn-
thetic lethal” interactions between oncogene mutations and other
cellular proteins is an emerging strategy for identifying novel
therapeutic targets in cancer. The underlying rationale is that
2 mutations compatible with survival on their own may be lethal
when combined. The goal of these experiments is to identify genes
that, when “knocked down,” selectively kill cells with RAS
mutations with the hope that some of these will be tractable targets
for drug discovery. Studies performed to date have uncovered
novel candidate targets whose suppression results in selective
apoptosis of oncogenic KRAS-mutant cell lines, including PLK1,
STK33, TBK1, and WT1.98-100 It will be several years before we
know whether patients with KRAS-mutant malignancies will ben-
eﬁt from drugs that inhibit any of these targets; however, a number
of issues have already emerged. First, there has been little overlap
in the candidate genes identiﬁed by different groups. Second,
genetic dependencies in cancer cell lines may not accurately reﬂect
reality in primary malignances, which, as clinicians know, are
exceptionally resilient. Third, reducing the expression of a protein
is not equivalent to pharmacologically inhibiting a speciﬁc activity
of that molecule. For example, many kinases are multidomain
proteins that regulate cell growth through enzymatic and nonenzy-
matic mechanisms. RNAi screens cannot distinguish which of
these functions is essential for the growth of transformed cells.
Finally, recent experience with RNAi screens emphasizes that it is
essential to thoroughly validate “hits” by attempting to rescue the
lethal phenotype by re-expressing candidate cDNA molecules that
are not inhibited by the knockdown construct used in the initial
screen. With these caveats in mind, in vitro and in vivo RNA
interference screening is a promising approach for discovering new
therapeutic targets in an unbiased manner. A recent study that
applied this general strategy to KRAS mutant nonsmall cell lung
cancer uncovered a strong synthetic lethal interaction with the

GATA2 transcription factor.101 This work was particularly impres-
sive as the authors identiﬁed drugable GATA-regulated signaling
modules, which they validated by performing in vivo preclinical
therapeutic trials in mice. Given the importance of GATA2 in
hematopoietic lineage speciﬁcation, these data have obvious impli-
cations for leukemia.

Summary and future directions

Developing therapeutic strategies to reverse the abnormal biochemi-
cal output of oncogenic Ras proteins without unacceptable toxicity
to normal cellular signaling networks is one of the fundamental
problems in cancer. NRAS and KRAS mutations contribute to a
spectrum of hematologic malignances, and genetic analysis of
human specimens as well as experiments in mouse models support
the idea that RAS mutations can initiate leukemic growth or serve
as cooperating mutations. The latter observation raises the question
of whether targeting oncogenic Ras is worthwhile in cancers, such
as AML, where it probably functions as a secondary mutation in
most patients. Although the answer to this question is unknown, a
reasonable working hypothesis is that any somatic genetic lesion
that undergoes positive clonal selection in a substantial percentage
of cancers contributes to malignant growth. The recent experience
with Flt3 inhibitors in AML supports this idea. Like NRAS, FLT3
mutations have been classiﬁed as “class 1” mutations that cooper-
ate with aberrant transcription to induce full leukemic transforma-
tion. Early-phase clinical
trials of potent and selective Flt3
inhibitors, such as AC220, showed that monotherapy induced remis-
sion in some patients with refractoryAML.102 Importantly, “gatekeeper”
mutations in the Flt3 kinase occur with relapse,103 providing compelling
genetic evidence that there is strong selective pressure for AML cells to
restore aberrant Flt3 signaling in vivo. Effective biochemical inhibition
of oncogenic Ras signaling in human acute leukemias with RAS
mutations would probably have similar efﬁcacy.

Treating advanced cancers with kinase inhibitors almost uni-
formly leads to genotype-speciﬁc response followed by regrowth
of resistant cells.104,105 Based on this precedent, combining inhibi-
tors of oncogenic Ras signaling with other anticancer agents will
probably be essential for sustained efﬁcacy. This general strategy
was recently implemented in patients with “high risk” B-lineage
ALL and BCR-ABL1 rearrangements with promising results.106 A
recent study in lung cancer cells lines with EGFR mutations
suggests that synthetic lethal screens might be particularly useful
for identifying proteins that contribute to resistance to inhibitors of
Ras effectors.107 In contrast to advanced cancers, such as AML and
MM, it is possible that “early-stage” hematologic disorders, such as
JMML, will respond to therapies that exclusively target oncogenic
Ras signaling networks.

Targeting aberrant signaling downstream of oncogenic Ras
remains a daunting challenge. Our current understanding of the Ras
effector pathways that are essential for cancer initiation and
maintenance is incomplete, and it is likely that these dependencies
vary in speciﬁc cell types. A related question is how “addicted”
different cancers are to oncogenic Ras signaling. At one end of the
spectrum, mutant RAS might be required during early stages of
leukemogenesis but dispensible thereafter. Alternatively, advanced
hematologic cancers, such as AML, might become ever more
dependent on oncogenic Ras as they evolve. If the latter proves
true, it will be important fully elucidate the feedback mechanisms
that cancer cells deploy to restrain aberrant signaling and to

characterize how these adaptations contribute to oncogene depen-
dence. In addition to their inherent value as potential anticancer
drugs, potent and selective inhibitors of Ras-regulated kinases are
invaluable tools for addressing these questions through in vitro and
in vivo studies.

Hematopoietic malignancies provide exceptional platforms for
addressing mechanistic and translational questions because of
established systems for culturing primary cells, robust mouse
models, and the ability to serially sample diseased tissues from
patients enrolled on clinical trials. Thus, rigorously interrogating
how targeted anticancer agents modulate oncogenic Ras signaling and
how this correlates with therapeutic response in hematologic malignan-
cies has broad implications for reducing the major contribution of
oncogenic RAS mutations to the worldwide burden of cancer.
