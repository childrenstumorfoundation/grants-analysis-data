Abstract
Background: Meningiomas may occur either as familial tumors in two distinct disorders, familial
multiple meningioma and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), or sporadically, as either single or multiple
tumors  in  individuals  with  no  family  history.  Meningiomas  in  NF2  and  approximately  60%  of
sporadic meningiomas involve inactivation of the NF2 locus, encoding the tumor suppressor merlin
on  chromosome  22q.  This  study  was  undertaken  to  establish  whether  genomic  profiling  could
distinguish familial multiple meningiomas from sporadic solitary and sporadic multiple meningiomas.
Methods: We compared 73 meningiomas presenting as sporadic solitary (64), sporadic multiple
(5)  and  familial  multiple  (4)  tumors  using  genomic  profiling  by  array  comparative  genomic
hybridization (array CGH).
Results: Sporadic solitary meningiomas revealed genomic rearrangements consistent with at least
two mechanisms of tumor initiation, as unsupervised cluster analysis readily distinguished tumors
with chromosome 22 deletion (associated with loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor) from those
without chromosome 22 deletion. Whereas sporadic meningiomas without chromosome 22 loss
exhibited  fewer  chromosomal  imbalance  events  overall,  tumors  with  chromosome  22  deletion
further  clustered  into  two  major  groups  that  largely,  though  not  perfectly,  matched  with  their
benign (WHO Grade I) or advanced (WHO Grades II and III) histological grade, with the latter
exhibiting  a  significantly  greater  degree  of  genomic  imbalance  (P  <  0.001).  Sporadic  multiple
meningiomas showed a frequency of genomic imbalance events comparable to the atypical grade
solitary tumors. By contrast, familial multiple meningiomas displayed no imbalances, supporting a
distinct mechanism for the origin for these tumors.

Conclusion:  Genomic  profiling  can  provide  an  unbiased  adjunct  to  traditional  meningioma
classification  and  provides  a  basis  for  exploring  the  different  genetic  underpinnings  of  tumor
initiation and progression. Most importantly, the striking difference observed between sporadic and
familial multiple meningiomas indicates that genomic profiling can provide valuable information for
differential diagnosis of subjects with multiple meningiomas and for considering the risk for tumor
occurrence in their family members.

Background
Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoidal cap cells of
the  leptomeninges,  display  an  annual  incidence  5.5  per
100,000, accounting for ~20% of all primary intracranial
tumors  [1,2].  They  may  be  classified  histologically  into
three  grades,  according  to  World  Health  Organization
(WHO) criteria [3]: WHO grade I meningiomas (~90%)
are slow growing benign tumors; WHO grade II meningi-
omas  (6–8%)  are  described  as  atypical  and  display
increased cellularity and mitotic activity; and WHO grade
III meningiomas (2–3%) are termed anaplastic or malig-
nant and have a high recurrence risk. Meningiomas com-
monly  occur  as  sporadic  solitary  tumors  in  the  general
population  and  may  be  found  at  autopsy  in  asympto-
matic individuals. They also occur in ~50% of individuals
with  the  inherited  disorder  neurofibromatosis  2  (NF2)
[4], which involves inactivation of the NF2 gene on chro-
mosome 22, encoding the merlin tumor suppressor [5,6].
About 60% of sporadic solitary meningiomas occur due
to merlin inactivation and usually display loss of one copy
of chromosome 22, while the mechanism of tumorigene-
sis in the remaining 40% remains unknown [3,7,8]. In 1–
8% of patients, meningiomas present as multiple tumors
either due to a predisposing NF2 mutation or due to non-
contiguous spread of a single sporadic tumor [9-15]. Non-
NF2 multiple meningiomas may appear either as sporadic
or  familial  cases  [9,11,12,16-20].  Like  sporadic  solitary
meningiomas, sporadic multiple meningiomas may dis-
play  somatic  NF2  mutations  [14,16],  whereas  familial
multiple  meningiomas  do  not  [16].  Like  NF2,  familial
multiple  meningioma  has  been  reported  to  show  auto-
somal dominant inheritance [21-23], but it does not show
linkage to the NF2 locus [24] and tumors from at least one
kindred  exhibit 
for  merlin  [18].
Together, the accumulated evidence indicates that in addi-
tion to inactivation of merlin, there are one or more other
mechanisms for initiating formation of a meningioma.

immunoreactivity 

Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH)
is a powerful whole genome profiling technology capable
of  detecting  both  DNA  copy  gain  and  loss  that  has  the
potential for unbiased classification of tumor specimens
based upon the constellation of genomic alterations that
they  possess.  Here  we  have  applied  this  technology  to
examine  genomic imbalance  events  in familial multiple
meningioma,  in  comparison  with  a  cohort  of  sporadic
solitary  meningiomas  and  sporadic  multiple  meningi-

omas. Our findings indicate that while genomic profiling
can implicate an etiology for sporadic tumors and suggest
candidates for initiation or progression loci, the revelation
of an absence of gross genomic imbalance events in famil-
ial  multiple  meningioma  suggests  that  it  is  a  distinct
genetic entity.

Methods
Tumor specimens
Patients  and  tumors  were  ascertained  through  the  Neu-
rofibromatosis Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital
as  previously  reported  [13,16].  Excess  tumor  tissue  not
required for diagnosis was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor tissue as previ-
ously described [16]. When available, pathology sections
were re-reviewed using 2007 WHO criteria [3]. Pathology
sections were not available for the 5 sporadic multiple and
4  familial  multiple  meningiomas.  In  addition,  some  of
the sporadic solitary meningiomas could not be scored for
histological subtype, particularly tumors that were more
anaplastic (in the grade II and III tumors). Specimens that
are "not scorable" had small fragments of tissue, insuffi-
cient for determination of histological subtype. In menin-
giomas  WHO  grade  II  or  III,  disruption  of  the  tumor's
growth  pattern  by  hypercellular  foci  and  sheeting  often
does not allow the accurate classification of the underly-
ing histological subtype. Specific patterns associated with
WHO  Grade  II  or  III  meningiomas  (such  as  rhabdoid,
papillary etc.) have been specified, as advised by the WHO
classification.

The  characteristics  of  the  sporadic  solitary  tumors  are
shown in Table 1. This tumor set partially overlaps with
the  set  investigated  previously  by  Nunes  et  al.  [25]  and
contains eight tumors reported in that study to show dele-
tion at the NF2 and EBP41L3 (DAL1) genes. Of the 9 mul-
tiple  meningiomas  studied  here,  3  (2  sporadic  and  1
familial)  were  investigated  previously  in  Heinrich  et  al.
[16] for deletion of the NF2 and EBP41L3 (DAL1) genes.
This  study  was  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review
Board  of  Massachusetts  General  Hospital  and  informed
consent was obtained from all study subjects.

fication (MLPA) using kit P044-NF2 following the manu-
facturer's  protocol  (MRC-Holland,  Amsterdam,  The
Netherlands; http://www.mrc-holland.com). Briefly, 200
ng  of  DNA  were  incubated  overnight  with  probe  mix
(P044) at 60°C. A 15-min ligation was performed after-
wards at 54°C. Ten μl of ligation products were used for
PCR using FAM-labeled universal primers. PCR products
were resolved using ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer and peaks
were  quantified  by  Genotyper  software.  The  data  were
analyzed and plotted by a custom excel based program.

Array CGH
Array  CGH  was  performed  for  all  tumors  using  Agilent
cDNA  microarrays  as  previously  described  [25].  These
arrays  contain  14,160  cDNA  clones  (Agilent  Technolo-
gies,  Palo  Alto,  CA)  with  a  median  interval  between
mapped elements of 100 kb, with 92.8% of intervals <1
Mb and 98.6% <3 Mb [26]. Briefly, one μg of tumor or
normal genomic DNA (male or female) was digested with
DpnII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), purified
with  DNA  Clean  &  Concentrator  (Zymo  Research,
Orange,  CA,  USA)  and  labeled  with  Cy3-dCTP  or  Cy5-
dCTP  (Amersham  Bioscience,  UK)  using  the  Bioprime
DNA  Labeling  System  (Invitrogen  Life  Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Labeled DNA was precipitated using
isopropanol  together  with  Cot-1  DNA  (Invitrogen  Life
Technologies,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA),  which  was  used  to
block  repetitive  sequences.  The  probe  pellet  was  then
washed with 70% ethanol, dried and dissolved in hybrid-
ization  buffer  consisting  of  50%  formamide,  2  ×  SSC,
10% dextran sulphate, 2% SDS and 10 μg/μl yeast tRNA.
Dye swap experiments were performed in all cases. One
common  male  control  DNA  and  one  common  female
control DNA were used for all hybridizations. The com-
parison between test sample and control sample was done
in a sex mismatched manner for most cases. Hybridiza-
tions  were  performed  in  sealed  chambers  for  60  h  at
37°C. After hybridization, slides were rinsed in 2 × SSC,
0.5% SDS at room temperature; washed for 20 min in 2 ×
SSC, 50% formamide at 50°C; 20 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1%
NP-40 at 50°C; and 10 min in 0.2 × SSC at 50°C. Slides
were then air dried by centrifugation before imaging. Six-
teen-bit TIF images were collected using an Axon 4000B
scanner  and  processed  initially  using  GenePix  Pro  4.1
(Axon Instruments, Inc. Union City, CA). Defective spots
were flagged by visual inspection of the images and subse-
quently custom software was used to exclude spots that

demonstrated low signal to noise ratios [27]. The baseline
CGH  level  (two  genomic  copies)  was  calculated  by  the
software  as  the  median  Cy3  and  Cy5  ratio  of  all  clones
analyzed. Dye swap experiments were merged to calculate
the mean and standard deviation of the signal for each tar-
get  clone.  The  normalized  values  were  transformed  to
log2  format  to  ensure  equal  weighting  for  gains  and
losses.

For  the  familial  multiple  meningiomas,  array  CGH  was
also performed using the Agilent 44 K CGH array (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto CA), which contains more than
43,000  coding  and  noncoding  human  oligonucleotide
sequences with an overall median probe spatial resolution
of  43  kb  (24  kb  within  RefSeq  genes)  [28].  Oligo  array
CGH was performed according to the manufacturer's pro-
tocol. Briefly, three μg of DNA (both test sample and con-
trol sample) were double digested with Alu I and Rsa I and
subsequently  purified  with  QIAprep  Spin  Miniprep  kit
(QIAGEN  GmbH,  Hilden,  Germany).  Digested  samples
were  labeled  with  Cy3-dUTP  or  Cy5-dUTP  (Amersham
Bioscience,  UK)  using  the  Bioprime  array  CGH  DNA
Labeling System (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA); paired samples were mixed and subsequently
purified  by  MicroCon  YM-30  (Millipore,  Billerica,  MA,
USA). Labeled probes were mixed with Cot-1 DNA (Invit-
rogen  Life  Technologies,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA),  blocking
solution  and  hybridization  solution  (Agilent  Technolo-
gies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and hybridized to a 44 K CGH
array. Hybridizations were performed in a 65°C oven on
rotating rack for 40 hrs. Arrays were washed with wash 1
and  2  solutions  (Agilent  Technologies,  Palo  Alto,  CA,
USA) and scanned immediately using the Agilent scanner.
Images  were  analyzed  using  Feature  Extraction  software
and data visualized with CGH analytics (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

Data analysis
Imbalanced chromosome segments (ICS) were identified
by change-point analysis using a circular binary segmen-
tation algorithm [29]. An ICS is defined in this study as a
segment  identified  by  change-point  analysis  with  mean
log2 ratio >0.20 (gain) or <-0.20 (loss) based upon a sep-
aration  of  2  standard  deviations  from  the  mean.  The
binary segmentation procedure applies the test recursively
until no more changes are detected in any of the segments
obtained from the change-points already found. When no

change point was found over the whole chromosome or
chromosome arm and the mean log2 value of the whole
chromosome or chromosome arm was either >0.20 or <-
0.20,  the  whole  chromosome  or  chromosome  arm  was
considered  imbalanced.  The  calling  of  whole  chromo-
some  or  chromosome  arm  imbalance  was  therefore
dependent upon the even distribution (no change point)
and mean of all data points involved in the whole chro-
mosome or chromosome arm, rather than on how many
probes have log2 ratio above a pre-defined number. The
physical  map  positions  of  subchromosomal  segments
were based on NCBI build 33. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test was used for comparing the ICS number differ-
ence between tumor groups. Hierarchical cluster analysis
was performed using the CGHsmooth [30] transformed
whole genome dataset. Probes with no copy change are
designated as 0, probes with one copy loss designated as -
1, probes with a copy number gain designated as 1, and
probes  with  amplification  designated  as  2.  Uncentered
correlation using the means of all pair-wise data points for
distance  metrics  (average  linkage)  was  used  for  cluster
analysis [31].

Results
Array CGH analysis of sporadic solitary meningiomas
To provide a basis for comparison of tumors from subjects
with multiple meningiomas, we first used two-color array
CGH  with  Agilent  human  cDNA  chips  to  generate
genomic  profiles  for  64  sporadic  solitary  meningiomas:
25  WHO  grade  I  (benign),  27  WHO  grade  II  (atypical)
and 12 WHO grade III (malignant). Representative array
CGH  profiles  with  segmentation  analysis  are  shown  in
Figure 1 (two benign meningiomas: Panels A and B; one
atypical: Panel C; one malignant meningioma: Panel D).
We observed a progressively increasing number of ICS in
higher grade tumors (see Figure 2 for the distribution of
ICS in each tumor group). The difference in total ICS (P <
0.001), as well as in gain events (P = 0.01) or loss events
(P < 0.001) considered separately, was significant between
benign and high grade tumor groups (atypical and malig-
nant) whereas the difference in total ICS between atypical
and malignant tumor groups was not (P = 0.47).

events

frequently 

The  above  analysis  revealed  a  number  of  recurrent  ICS,
shown in the HEAT map of Figure 3, that are largely con-
sistent with previous studies using a variety of technolo-
gies.  Deletion 
on
chromosomes 22 (71%), 1 (39%), 14 (25%), 6 (22%), 18
(20%), 3 (17%), 10 (16%), 9 (13%), 4 (13%), 11 (11%)
and X (11%). Gain events occurred on chromosome 1, 17
and 20 (11%, 12.5% and 11% respectively). The predom-
inant event in benign meningiomas was 22q deletion, in
64% of the tumors. In atypical meningiomas, 22q dele-
tion occurred in 67% of the tumors, followed in frequency
by  deletion  of  1p  (52%),  14q  (41%)  and  6q  (26%),

whereas  in  malignant  meningiomas,  1p  deletion  was
equally as frequent as 22q deletion, occurring in 75% of
these tumors, followed by deletion of 6q, 9p and 10q (all
at 50%), 3p at 42%, and gain of 20q (33%). These data are
consistent with the accepted view that deletion of chro-
mosome 22 is an early event responsible for initiation of
the  major  fraction  of  sporadic  meningiomas,  but  that  a
significant minority of tumors arises via some other mech-
anism. It is also thought that meningiomas progress via a
stepwise  pathway,  i.e.,  atypical  and  malignant  meningi-
omas develop due to accumulation of additional genomic
lesions  [32].  Our  whole  genome  profiling  data  for  spo-
radic solitary meningiomas largely support such a model,
as  there  was  significantly  (P  <  0.001)  greater  genomic
instability in high grade tumors than in low grade tumors.

Array CGH analysis of multiple meningiomas
Co-occurrence  of  multiple  meningiomas  in  individuals
who do not have germline NF2 mutation occurs far less
frequently  than  do  solitary  meningiomas.  We  obtained
four familial multiple meningiomas from three unrelated
individuals  (all  female),  along  with  five  tumors  from
three  individuals  with  sporadic  multiple  meningiomas
with DNA quality adequate for this study. Previous muta-
tional  analysis  identified  somatic  NF2  mutations  in  the
sporadic  multiple  meningiomas  but  not  in  the  familial
cases [16]. We performed gene dosage analysis by MLPA
to  determine  whether  there  was  somatic  loss  of  NF2  in
these tumors (Figure 4). One copy of NF2 was deleted in
all  sporadic  multiple  meningiomas,  consistent  with  the
known "two-hit" mechanism of tumorigenesis involving
the merlin tumor suppressor. However, none of the famil-
ial  multiple  meningiomas  showed  a  loss  at  NF2.  These
findings,  and  the  prior  mutation  analyses,  support  the
notion that familial multiple meningiomas do not arise
by inactivation of the NF2 gene.

By genomic profiling using two-color array CGH with Agi-
lent human cDNA chips, we found that the sporadic mul-
tiple  meningiomas  had  several  recurrent  ICS,  including
deletion  of  the  whole  chromosome  22  in  all  5  tumors,
deletion of 1p, all of chromosome 14, and part or all of
chromosome 10 in 4 of 5 tumors and gain of the whole
chromosome 20 in 2 of 5 tumors. This pattern was similar
to that seen in Grade II sporadic solitary meningiomas, as
was the average ICS/tumor of 5.8 ± 2.7 in sporadic multi-
ple meningiomas and 5.0 ± 4.5 in atypical sporadic soli-
tary  meningiomas.  In  stark  contrast,  familial  multiple
meningiomas did not show any ICS.

Cluster analysis of meningioma array CGH data
To provide an unbiased global view of these genomic pro-
files, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster anal-
ysis using the CGHsmooth transformed dataset [30]. The
cluster  analysis  was  done  by  average  linkage  using  the

yielding  the  tree  presentation  shown  in  Figure  3.  The
unsupervised  cluster  analysis  split  the  whole  tumor  set
into two main branches, one comprised of tumors with
chromosome 22 deletion (left side of Figure 3) and one
comprised  of  tumors  without  chromosome  22  deletion
(right  side).  The  procedure  further  subdivided  the  spo-
radic  solitary  meningiomas  with  chromosome  22  dele-
tion  into  two  major  groups,  with  the  exception  of  four
outliers (27A, 2M, 43A and 81A). One group contained
14 Grade I tumors along with 7 higher Grade tumors (6 II

and 1 III). Notably, 13 of these 14 Grade I meningiomas
were grouped into a single subcluster characterized by loss
of  chromosome  22  as  the  only  major  imbalance  event.
The second major group was comprised mainly of menin-
giomas of advanced grade (11 Grade II and 7 Grade III out
of 20 solitary sporadic tumors), although 2 tumors classi-
fied as Grade I were also present. These tumors had more
ICS than those in the first group and implicate progres-
sion genes at loci involving losses on chromosomes 1p,
14q, 6q, 18, 9p and 10q and gains on chromosomes 17q
and 20.

The distribution of Imbalanced Chromosome Segments in three groups of sporadic solitary meningiomas
The distribution of Imbalanced Chromosome Segments in three groups of sporadic solitary meningiomas. Each 
dot represents an individual tumor. Y-axis indicates the total number of imbalanced chromosome segments (ICS) in each 
tumor; X-axis shows three groups of meningioma of different grades. The total number of ICS ranges from 0–12 in benign 
meningiomas, 0–14 in atypical meningiomas and 2–25 in malignant meningiomas.

Though the cluster analysis generally reflected, with some
exceptions, the benign or advanced histological grading of
those  solitary  sporadic  meningiomas  showing  chromo-
some 22 loss, the solitary sporadic meningiomas without
chromosome 22 loss were not at all grouped according to
their grade. There were very few imbalance events for most
benign  and  atypical  meningiomas  of  this  type.  Indeed,
there  was  a  notable  subgroup  of  high  grade  tumors  in
both  chromosome  22-defined  groupings  (such  as  21M,
33M,  128M,  26A,  29A,  34A,  40A,  42A,  44A,  45A,  72A,
80A, 83A) that did not exhibit extensive genomic imbal-
ance (ICS = 4). Many of these tumors exhibited no chro-
mosome 22 deletion. Overall, we observed a significant
difference  in  the  frequency  of  non-chromosome  22
genomic  imbalance  events  between  solitary  sporadic
tumors with chromosome 22 deletion and those without
(P  =  0.006).  Though  the  difference  was  confined  to
tumors  of  advanced  grade,  it  may  have  contributed,  in
addition to chromosome 22 loss, to the segregation of the
solitary  sporadic  meningiomas  into  two  main  branches
(Figure 3). In any event, while our data are generally con-
sistent with a traditional multistep model of tumor pro-
gression  for  those  meningiomas  with  chromosome  22
deletion,  where  NF2  inactivation  is  likely  the  initiating
event, this may not apply to tumors without chromosome

22 deletion, which apparently harbor unidentified genetic
lesions that may result in more direct progression without
the accumulation of multiple ICS.

In  the  unsupervised  cluster  analysis,  familial  multiple
meningiomas  were  cleanly  distinguished  from  the  spo-
radic multiple meningiomas. The latter were spread across
the  left  hand  side  of  the  cluster  diagram  in  Figure  3,
among the  tumors  with  chromosome  22  loss,  one  with
the outliers mentioned above, one amid several atypical
tumors  in  the  grouping  of  mainly  benign  tumors  and
three  in  the  grouping  mainly  of  atypical  and  malignant
tumors.  By  contrast,  the  familial  multiple  meningiomas
clustered among the solitary sporadic tumors to the right
of Figure 3, characterized by the absence of chromosome
22 loss.

To determine whether the familial multiple meningiomas
might harbor smaller imbalance events that were missed
by the relatively low resolution cDNA chip, we repeated
the array CGH analysis of these particular familial multi-
ple meningioma samples using a newer, higher resolution
Agilent human oligo array. Even with this higher resolu-
tion  array,  the  familial  multiple  meningioma  tumors
showed no ICS in any of the four tumors, supporting the

as an effective method to generate informative profiles in
a  genome-wide  manner.  Previously,  large-scale  gene
expression profiling using RNA extracted from tumor tis-
sue  has  demonstrated  its  utility  in  classifying  different
tumor subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma [33,34] and
solid tumors [35,36]. It has also been applied to study the
molecular signatures of meningiomas of different grades
and  locations  [37-41].  Notably,  in  a  recent  study,  gene
expression patterns were shown to be predictive of major
cytogenetic patterns seen in meningiomas (chromosome
22  or  22q  loss,  loss  of  1p36  alone, complex  karyotypes
with  loss  of  1p36 and/or  14q  and  diploid)  based  upon
altered expression of a combination of genes within the
regions of altered dosage and genes outside these regions
[42]. Each individual gene expression change represented
an  apparent  correlate  of  the  corresponding  cytogenetic
abnormality that could potentially play a role in meningi-
oma initiation or progression. In particular, those altered
genes  not  actually  located  in  a  region  of  cytogenetic
abnormality may well represent components of pathways
critical to meningioma formation. While it is difficult to
assign such a role to each individual gene without addi-
tional  studies,  the  overall  pattern  observed  was  clearly
associated with patient outcome, though not with tumor
histopathology.

Like gene expression profiling, whole genome profiling by
array  CGH  using  DNA  extracted  from  tumor  tissue  has
also shown its power to differentiate solid tumors of both
mouse and human [27,43-45]. Solid tumors often exhibit
genomic imbalance events and some of these imbalance
events are specific to certain types or subtypes of tumors.
In view of the stable nature of DNA compared with RNA,
array CGH is a potentially more widely applicable, easy
and effective method for histo-molecular classification. In
addition, array CGH provides information about genome
stability of the tumor, which may be critical information
for assessing its biological state and pathogenic potential.

Our array CGH analysis of sporadic solitary meningiomas
detected a wide variety of genomic events, largely consist-
ent with those which have been detected previously by a
variety of cytogenetic and molecular techniques, and have
often been associated with tumor progression [32,46-52].
Notably, through unsupervised cluster analysis using our
entire  genome  array  CGH  dataset,  we  observed  a  clean
separation of meningiomas with or without chromosome
22 deletion for both solitary and multiple meningiomas.
Chromosome  22  deletion  is  a  frequent  mechanism  for
somatic inactivation of the NF2 gene, thought to account
for ~60% of meningiomas [7]. The initiating event(s) in
meningiomas  that  retain  chromosome  22  has  not  yet
been identified. The distinction between the two groups
of meningiomas by array CGH cluster analysis apparently
reflects the existence of at least two main types of genetic
mechanism for meningioma tumorigenesis. Since no con-

the left and tumors without chromosome 22 deletion on the 
right. Of the sporadic multiple meningiomas, DAV331, 
DAV308 and DAV292 are from the same person (but do not 
show identical ICS patterns) and DAV261 and DAV263 are

MLPA analysis of sporadic and familial multiple meningiomas
MLPA analysis of sporadic and familial multiple meningiomas. Representative MLPA analyses of a familial multiple 
meningioma (DAV338, top panel) and a sporadic multiple meningioma (DAV308, bottom panel) are shown with probe IDs on 
the X-axis. There are 21 MLPA probes for the NF2 gene (one probe for each exon, two probes for the promotor region and 
one probe on either side of the gene) and 12 control probes located on other chromosomes. The Y-axis shows the relative 
probe peak height as an indication of copy number. The relative peak heights were calculated by normalizing the peak height of 
control probes between normal control DNA and tumor DNA. Gray bars indicate the mean peak height with standard devia-
tion from 10 normal control DNAs. Black bars indicate the peak height for the tested tumor DNA. The top panel reveals no 
deletion of the NF2 gene while the bottom panel is consistent with deletion of one copy of the NF2 gene, including its flanking 
regions. All multiple meningiomas and a sampling of 10 sporadic solitary meningiomas were tested by MLPA, with results at this 
locus identical to those from array CGH.

sistent  imbalance  event  predominates  among  tumors
without chromosome 22 deletion, there may be a greater
genetic  diversity  in  the  initiation  of  these  tumors.  The
lower number of ICS in tumors that retain chromosome
22 is consistent with the lack of genomic events detected
previously using multi-allele marker techniques [53].

Our data also revealed segregation, based upon a variety
of  genomic  events,  of  tumors  that  lost  chromosome  22

into two major groups, one consisting predominantly of
benign tumors and the other predominantly of tumors of
advanced histological grade (Figure 3). The cluster analy-
sis therefore illustrates some potential utility and power of
array CGH profiling as an objective means for tumor sub-
classification  and  subgrouping.  Due  to  the  existence  of
genetic  heterogeneity  among  meningiomas  and  the
nature of histological examination, we did not expect all
tumors to be assigned by cluster analysis precisely in con-

cert with their pathological grade and indeed, that was the
case.  However,  the  tendency,  with  some  exceptions,  of
Grade  I  tumors  to  cluster  separately  from  higher  grade
tumors  suggests  that  further  refinement  of  the  genomic
profiling strategy is warranted, in combination with more
extensive molecular analysis to determine whether differ-
ences are due to misclassification by array CGH or rather
represent tumors whose molecular changes and predicted
behavior are not efficiently recognized in the standard his-
tological examination.

Whole genome array CGH analysis revealed a significant
distinction between sporadic meningiomas with or with-
out  chromosome  22  deletion.  Advanced  grade  tumors
with  chromosome  22  deletion  had  significantly  more
imbalance  events  in  the  rest  of  the  genome  than  those
without, suggesting not only a different genetic etiology,
but also a different pathway for tumor progression. This
distinction also raises the possibility that prior chromo-
some 22 loss itself may contribute directly to subsequent
genomic  instability.  Therefore,  the  array  CGH  analysis
points to the need to unravel potential alternative genetic
pathways  for a complete  understanding  of  meningioma
tumorigenesis. The cDNA array used here did not provide
a sufficiently dense coverage to identify small regions of
loss  that  could  target  specific  suppressor  genes  and  we
detected no cases of homozygous deletion. There may be
potential  clues  to  alternative  pathways  revealed  by  the
amplification  events  readily  detected  in  some  tumors,
though  these  also  typically  covered  relatively  large  seg-
ments and occurred primarily in malignant meningiomas.
For example, meningioma 126M displayed amplification
of an ~500 kb region (1.9–2.4 Mb) on chromosome 11
spanning, among other genes, the loci for insulin (INS)
and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which has been
implicated  previously  in  some  meningiomas  through
expression  studies  [41].  However,  the  same  tumor  also
displays  larger  amplifications  on  chromosome  1  (78.6–
87.5 Mb) and chromosome 17 (41.8–64.0 Mb), both of
which contain numerous genes that could potentially play
a role in meningioma growth. Similarly, tumor 128M dis-
played a focal amplification of the c-myc oncogene (MYC)
on chromosome 8, whose expression may correlate with
proliferative index and help predict recurrence of menin-
giomas [54,55], but the same tumor also had a high level
gain  on  chromosome  17  (49.2–64.0  Mb),  overlapping
with the large region amplified in 126M. When compared
with all tumors that showed a gain on chromosome 17,
the minimum shared segment is 58.9–64 Mb and spans
more than 40 genes, including such known growth con-
trol-related  genes  as  the  growth  hormone-chorionic
somatomammotropin cluster and a protein kinase C fam-
ily member (PKCA) among others. One benign meningi-
oma  (63B)  had  a  focal  amplification  in  a  gene-rich
segment  on  chromosome  12  (56.19–56.45  Mb),  which
includes  CDK4,  a  known  regulator  of  G1-S  progression

that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma gene product, Rb,
along with several other potential candidates. These dis-
parate events support the possibility that different mecha-
nisms of progression may occur in different tumors but
their large size, inconsistent occurrence and lack of a uni-
fied  predictive  pattern  suggests  that  an  integration  of
detailed genomic, genetic, gene expression and functional
studies will be needed to delineate the array of alternative
pathways to meningioma growth in vivo.

Most  importantly  in  our  study,  array  CGH  analysis
revealed  strikingly  different  genomic  profiles  between
familial  multiple  meningioma  and  sporadic  multiple
meningioma. Though this represents only a small number
of tumors and even a single case of loss in one familial
multiple meningioma of chromosome 22 or of one of the
other chromosomal regions altered in the sporadic multi-
ple meningiomas would reduce the apparent distinction,
the absence of all genetic rearrangements in the familial
multiple  meningiomas  is  noteworthy.  For  example,  the
likelihood  that  all  4  familial  multiple  tumors  retained
chromosome 22 (based upon its overall rate of retention
in meningiomas) is ~0.04. Combined with the absence of
any  other  genomic  rearrangement  in  all  4  such  tumors,
the  retention  of  chromosome  22  provides  further  evi-
dence that familial multiple meningioma is a genetically
distinct tumor predisposition syndrome. Given that NF2
mutation was not seen and that chromosome 22 deletion
is not a shared feature in these tumors, we believe that one
or  more  other  tumor  suppressor  genes  or  oncogenes  is
responsible for the tumor initiation of familial multiple
meningioma. Although no genomic imbalance event was
identified,  even  with  the  higher  resolution  oligonucle-
otide  array,  it  is  conceivable  that  loss  of  heterozygosity
without  copy  number  change  may  be  uncovered  using
high  density  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNP)
arrays. The finding that sporadic multiple meningiomas
harbor  a  similar  level  of  genomic  imbalance  events  to
atypical solitary meningiomas should also draw attention
to  the  potential  for  greater  subarachnoid  spreading  or
higher aggressiveness that would produce a worse progno-
sis than familial multiple meningiomas. Further, as spo-
radic  multiple  meningioma  and 
familial  multiple
meningioma  cannot  be  distinguished  histopathologi-
cally, array CGH can provide an important means of dif-
ferential diagnosis.

Conclusion
Genome  profiling  using  array  CGH  can  be  a  valuable
complement to histopathology for routine tumor diagno-
sis and grading and for implicating etiology of meningi-
omas.  Moreover,  it  can  aid  differential  diagnosis  of
multiple  meningiomas,  distinguishing  sporadic  and
familial forms, with potential clinical implications for the
risk of meningioma occurrence in other members of the
family.
