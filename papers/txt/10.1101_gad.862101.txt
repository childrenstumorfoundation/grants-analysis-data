Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent genetic disorder that affects growth properties of
neural-crest-derived cell populations. In addition, approximately one-half of NF1 patients exhibit learning
disabilities. To characterize NF1 function both in vitro and in vivo, we circumvent the embryonic lethality of
NF1 null mouse embryos by generating a conditional mutation in the NF1 gene using Cre/loxP technology.
Introduction of a Synapsin I promoter driven Cre transgenic mouse strain into the conditional NF1
background has ablated NF1 function in most differentiated neuronal populations. These mice have abnormal
development of the cerebral cortex, which suggests that NF1 has an indispensable role in this aspect of CNS
development. Furthermore, although they are tumor free, these mice display extensive astrogliosis in the
absence of conspicuous neurodegeneration or microgliosis. These results indicate that NF1-deficient neurons
are capable of inducing reactive astrogliosis via a non-cell autonomous mechanism.

Von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is
a common inherited neurological disease that affects 1 in
3500 individuals world wide (Riccardi 1999; Zhu and
Parada 2001). Two major clinical features of NF1 are con-
fined to the embryonic neural crest compartment and
include formation of benign tumors along peripheral and
optic nerves (neurofibromas and gliomas) as well as ab-
normal distribution of melanocytes (cafe-au-lait spots).
NF1 patients also have increased risk of developing ma-
lignant tumors of neural origin (Gutmann et al. 1997;
Riccardi 1999).

The human NF1 gene (Cawthon et al. 1990; Viskochil
et al. 1990; Wallace et al. 1990) gene spans about 335 kb
and contains 60 exons (Li et al. 1995; Viskochil 1999).
The NF1 mRNA is ∼11–13 kb in length and encodes a
2818-amino-acid protein product that is designated neu-
rofibromin (Buchberg et al. 1990; DeClue et al. 1991;
Gutmann et al. 1991). Neurofibromin contains a func-
tional GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain
(GRD; Ballester et al. 1990; Buchberg et al. 1990; Martin
et al. 1990; Xu et al. 1990) that shares homology with the

GAP family members, such as p120rasGAP in verte-
brates (Trahey and McCormick 1987; Trahey et al. 1988;
Vogel et al. 1988; Baba et al. 1995), ira1 and ira2 in yeast
(Tanaka et al. 1990), and GAP1 in Drosophila (Gaul et al.
1992). Thus, neurofibromin GRD is both a structural and
functional homolog of p120rasGAP.

Ras belongs to a superfamily of G proteins that cycle
between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound
forms (Boguski and McCormick 1993). GAP proteins ter-
minate ras-mediated signaling by stimulating conver-
sion of the active GTP-bound form to the inactive GDP-
bound form. Thus, the tumor-suppressor activity of neu-
rofibromin is thought to be mediated via negative
regulation of ras, which affects proliferation and differ-
entiation in a variety of cell types (Bourne et al. 1990).
Ras-activating mutations have been found in many hu-
man cancers (Bos 1989). Consistent with this, decrease
or loss of neurofibromin activity is correlated with el-
evated ras-GTP levels in neurofibrosarcoma-derived cell
lines (Basu et al. 1992; DeClue et al. 1992) and myeloid
leukemia cells (Bollag et al. 1996). In addition, neurofi-
bromin can negatively regulate p21 ras independent of
its GAP activity in some contexts (Johnson et al. 1994).
Genotype analysis confirmed that NF1 acts as a classic
tumor suppressor because the majority of mutations
identified in NF1 patients are inactivating (Upadhyaya et

al. 1994). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus
has been identified in pheochromocytomas (Xu et al.
1992), neurofibrosarcomas (Legius et al. 1993), and my-
eloid leukemias (Side et al. 1997). However, only a small
percentage of benign neurofibromas, the hallmark fea-
ture of NF1, exhibit NF1 LOH (Colman et al. 1995;
Sawada et al. 1996). This may in part be caused by the
heterogeneous nature of neurofibromas, which are com-
posed of Schwann cells, neurons, fibroblasts, and peri-
neurial cells (Peltonen et al. 1988). Whether these heter-
ogeneous tumors arise from NF1 LOH at one or all cell
types remains to be determined.

NF1 homozygous (NF1−/−) mice die in utero because
of abnormal cardiac development (Brannan et al. 1994;
Jacks et al. 1994). NF1 heterozygous (NF1+/−) mice are
viable and fail to develop features of human NF1, such as
neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots, but do develop spe-
cific malignancies, including pheochromocytomas and
myeloid leukemias in later life (Jacks et al. 1994). Thus,
like many tumor suppressor knockout mice (Jacks 1996;
Ghebranious and Donehower 1998; McClatchey and
Jacks 1998), NF1+/− mice have failed to replicate the
human condition with fidelity.

There are several nontumor syndromes that are asso-
ciated with NF1 disease. For example, 35%–65% of NF1
children display specific learning disabilities (North
1999). Consistent with studies in human NF1, NF1+/−
mice display spatial learning disability, which can be
overcome by extended training (Silva et al. 1997). Guo et
al. (2000) reported that Drosophila NF1 mutants have
learning disabilities as well. The mechanisms underly-
ing learning disability in both human and mouse NF1
brains remain unknown. However, these observations
suggest that NF1 may play an important role in neuronal
development and physiology.

To study the physiological role of NF1 in neural de-
velopment and to generate a better model for human
NF1, we have used the Cre/loxP system (Gu et al. 1994)
to generate a conditional allele (NF1flox) at the NF1 lo-
cus. In this study, we describe the effectiveness of the
NF1 conditional allele for studying the function of neu-
rofibromin in differentiated neurons. The data support
the model that loss of NF1 function in neurons can have
non-cell autonomous consequences in vivo. This NF1
mouse model provides a valuable tool to study neuronal
and glial phenotypes associated with human NF1 dis-
ease.

Results

Generation of NF1 conditional mutant mice
by Cre/loxP

Exon 31 is essential for NF1 gene function in both hu-
mans and mice (Brannan et al. 1994). Therefore, we de-
signed a gene-targeting strategy that flanked exons 31
and 32 with loxP sites, such that both exons can be de-
leted by Cre-mediated recombination (Fig. 1A). The tar-
geting vectors were transfected into embryonic stem (ES)
cells and 2 of 415 clones contained the targeted alleles as

determined by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The ho-
mologous
recombinant clones were injected into
C57BL/6 blastocysts and subsequently transmitted into
the germ line. Homozygous NF1flox/flox and compound
heterozygous NF1flox/− mice were generated through
appropriate crosses, and both strains are viable and fer-
tile (Fig. 1C,D). To further characterize the NF1flox al-
lele, we monitored a cohort of 35 NF1flox/flox and 29
NF1flox/− mice over a period of 14 mo. Unlike NF1flox/
flox mice that exhibited a typical wild-type survival pro-
file, NF1flox/− mice began to die at 10 mo of age, and
only 80% survived beyond 14 mo (Fig. 1E). Thus, the
NF1flox/− survival profile is indistinguishable from that
of NF1+/− mice (Jacks et al. 1994). Based on this survival
result, the NF1flox allele behaves like a wild-type allele
despite the presence of two loxP sites and a neo cassette
in the introns flanking exons 31 and 32.

To determine whether Cre-mediated recombination in
the NF1flox allele results in a null allele, we crossed
NF1flox/flox mice with a transgenic strain that ex-
presses Cre recombinase in the mouse germ line (Voi-
culescu et al. 2000). The resultant progeny harbor a re-
combined allele (NF1⌬) and a wild-type allele, NF1⌬/+.
These mice were bred into the NF1 null background to
generate compound heterozygous NF1⌬/− progeny.
NF1⌬/− embryos are indistinguishable from NF1−/− em-
bryos, which are characterized by an enlarged heart, pe-
ripheral edema, hemorrhage, small unpigmented eyes,
and which die at E13.5 because of cardiac abnormalities
(Fig. 1F; Brannan et al. 1994; Jacks et al. 1994). These
results indicate that the NF1flox allele is susceptible to
Cre-mediated recombination in vivo and that the recom-
bined NF1flox allele (NF1⌬) is a phenocopy of the null
allele. We conclude that the NF1flox allele represents a
functional conditional allele.

NF1 mutant dorsal root ganglion neurons gain
neurotrophin independence because of direct loss
of NF1 function

We showed previously that, unlike wild-type counter-
parts, cultured embryonic NF1−/− sensory and sympa-
thetic neurons survive without added neurotrophins (Vo-
gel et al. 1995). These data supported the model that loss
of NF1 function results in constitutive activation of the
ras pathway downstream from Trk receptors, even in the
absence of neurotrophins. However, those studies could
not exclude the possibility that loss of NF1 function de-
velopmentally altered neuronal precursors, enabling
them to undergo differentiation without requiring neu-
rotrophin signaling. To examine whether the neuro-
trophin independence that is acquired by NF1−/− neu-
rons is direct, we repeated the neurotrophin survival ex-
periments using dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons
cultured from NF1flox/flox or NF1flox/− embryos.
NF1flox/− cultured embryonic DRG neurons were in-
fected with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven,
Cre-expressing recombinant adenovirus at varying mul-
tiplicities of infection (MOI). Cre-mediated recombina-
tion was monitored by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2A,B).

P1, P3, and P4 primers is used to genotype NF1flox mice; the

and addition of neutralizing anti-NGF antibody. Only
the cultures that were infected with Cre-adenovirus (re-
sulting in NF1 deficiency) persisted in the absence of
NGF (Fig. 2C). Uninfected cultures or cultures that were
infected with a CMV LacZ-expressing adenovirus under-
went classical, neurotrophin-deprivation cell death (Vo-
gel et al. 1995). These data provide direct evidence that
neurotrophin independence resulted from functional
loss of NF1 in the differentiated neuronal cultures and
further validate the functionality of the conditional
NF1flox allele in primary cultures.

Synapsin I–Cre transgenic mice specifically express
Cre recombinase in differentiated neurons

To assess the role of NF1 in neurons, we produced and
characterized a neuronal-specific Cre recombinase trans-
genic (Tg) strain. In this strain, Cre expression is con-
trolled by the rat Synapsin I promoter, which has been
shown to drive transgene expression specifically in neu-
ronal cells (Hoesche et al. 1993). To examine the tempo-
ral and spatial pattern of Cre activity, we crossed SynI–
Cre Tg mice to a LacZ indicator Tg strain (␤-actin/LacZ)
that requires Cre recombinase activity to permit expres-
sion of the ␤-galactosidase (␤-gal) gene (Tsien et al. 1996).
We can detect Cre function as early as E12.5, when ␤-gal
activity is restricted to brain, spinal cord, and DRG (Fig.
3A–D). Histological analysis showed that Cre activity is
mainly distributed in differentiated neurons, outside the
ventricular regions of the brain and spinal cord (data not
shown). These data are consistent with endogenous Syn-
apsin I gene expression (Melloni and DeGennaro 1994).
To assess whether Cre activity remains restricted to neu-
rons in adult mice, we first performed PCR assays on
genomic DNA isolated from brain, spinal cord, heart,
lung, kidney, and liver of NF1flox;SynI–Cre mice. Cre-
mediated recombination was only detected in brain and
spinal cord (data not shown). We next performed double
immunohistochemistry using anti-LacZ (detecting Cre
activity) and anti-NeuN (neuronal marker; Mullen et al.
1992) antibodies on brain and spinal cord sections from
double transgenic SynI–Cre;LacZ mice. Figure 3E–P
show representative examples of double labeling from
the cortex, spinal cord, and hippocampus. NeuN immu-
noreactivity (red signal) essentially colocalized with
LacZ reactivity (green signal), which indicates that Cre
activity is mainly distributed in neurons. Unlike most
areas of the brain, LacZ immunoreactivity is low in the
cerebellum, where only few Purkinje cells remain posi-
tive (Fig. 3Q–S).

To directly examine the status of the floxed NF1 allele
when exposed to Synapsin I-Cre expression, NF1flox/
+;SynI–Cre mice were bred to NF1flox/flox mice, result-
ing in 25% of the offspring with NF1flox/flox;SynI–Cre
genotype. We refer to the neuronal-specific NF1 mutant
mice as, NF1SynIKO. To verify neuron-specific Cre activ-
ity, we performed immunohistochemistry using anti-
NF1 antibody on brains and spinal cords from control
and NF1SynIKO mutant mice. Although cortical and spi-
nal cord neurons from control mice contain strong neu-

rofibromin staining (Fig. 4A,B,D; Norland et al. 1993),
neurofibromin immunoreactivity was completely lost in
NF1SynIKO counterparts (Fig. 4E,F,H). However, consis-
tent with the LacZ staining data, many mutant Purkinje
cells remain positive for neurofibromin (Fig. 4G). Taken
together, the data indicate that neuron-specific expres-
sion of Cre recombinase results in ablation of neurofi-
bromin in most NF1SynIKO neurons.

pression was confined to neuronal layers and did not
coincide with GFAP-positive astrocytes. Thus, we con-
clude that most, if not all NF1SynIKO astrocytes do not
undergo Cre-mediated recombination and that SynI–Cre
Tg mice primarily and specifically express the Cre re-
combinase transgene in most populations of differenti-
ated neurons. Consequently, the phenotypes described
below are the result of NF1 loss in neurons.

Cre recombinase is not expressed in astroglia

Loss of NF1 in neurons affects cortical development

Most astrocytes do not normally express detectable NF1
(Daston et al. 1992). Therefore, to ensure that Cre-medi-
ated recombination does not occur in NF1SynIKO astro-
cytes, we used two approaches. First, we crossed
NF1SynIKO mice into two LacZ indicator strains (␤-ac-
tin–LacZ and Rosa26–LacZ), which gave similar results.
Rosa26–LacZ has been widely used and documented to
express LacZ in all cells (Soriano 1999). Double labeling
with antibodies directed against LacZ and astrocyte-spe-
cific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed
on SynI–Cre;Rosa26–LacZ brain sections. We focus on
the hippocampus because it contains the highest levels
of endogenous GFAP-positive astrocytes, although simi-
lar results were observed in all regions of the CNS. As
shown in Figure 5A,C, LacZ immunoreactivity is mainly
localized in the neuronal layer of CA2/3 (Fig. 5A) and
dentate gyrus (Fig. 5C) and does not colocalize with
GFAP. A positive control using a transgenic strain that
expresses Cre recombinase both in neurons and glia, and
therefore exhibits colocalization of LacZ and GFAP, is
indicated in Figure 5A, inset. To rule out the possibility
that Cre-mediated deletion may occur more efficiently
in the floxed NF1 locus than in the floxed LacZ locus
(which could result in astrocytes that are NF1 deficient
but LacZ negative), we performed double labeling with
anti-Cre and anti-GFAP (Fig. 5B,D). Like LacZ, Cre ex-

There was no apparent embryonic lethality occurring in
NF1SynIKO mice, and newborn NF1SynIKO pups were in-
distinguishable from their control littermates (NF1flox/
flox or flox/+;SynI–Cre; data not shown). These results
indicate that neuronal NF1 function is not required for
survival through birth. Three to four days after birth,
NF1SynIKO mice began to exhibit growth retardation
that was sustained into adulthood, with a reduction in
both weight and size that stabilized at ∼50% of normal
littermates (Table 1; data not shown). Otherwise, the
NF1SynIKO mice appeared to be normal and were fertile.
We monitored size and weight of internal organs in adult
NF1SynIKO mice and found that the kidney, heart, liver,
and spleen showed a proportional reduction in both
weight and size (Table 1; data not shown). In contrast, we
saw limited reduction in brain size (Table 1). Separate
analysis of different structures of the brain revealed that
reduced brain weight is limited to the forebrain (Table
1). Histological analysis of NF1SynIKO brains
re-
vealed a conspicuous defect in the cerebral cortex,
which is characterized by a reduction in cortical
thickness and an apparent increase in cell density
(Fig. 6A–H). Morphometric analysis of serial coronal sec-
tions throughout the anterior-to-posterior length of
NF1SynIKO and control brains indicated a significant re-
duction in mutant cortical thickness by ∼20% (Fig. 6A–

bral cortex, given that the dorso–ventral and the me-

NF1SynIKO brains (Fig. 7C).

We next examined the cortex of the mutant mice for
total cell number (as determined by H&E counts) and
neuron number using NeuN staining (Fig. 7D). These
data indicated that negligible total cell or neuronal loss
occurs in the mutant cortices. Thus, the decreased di-

not likely to be the result of reduced cell number (Fig.

apparent lamination, although we detected intact lay-
ered structure in some regions of the NF1SynIKO mutant
brains (Fig. 6B,F).

To evaluate neuronal differentiation in NF1SynIKO
brains, we performed immunohistochemistry using anti-

MAP2 (dendritic marker) antibody. As shown in Figure

tinguishable between control and mutant brains, except
that the mutant cortex tended to show greater MAP2
immunoreactivity consistent with higher neuronal den-
sity. We also examined cortical, hippocampal, and Pur-
kinje neurons in NF1SynIKO mutant brains using anti-
bodies against several calcium-binding proteins, includ-

NF1 conditional knockouts exhibit astrogliosis

Figure 7.
Increased cell density in the cerebral cor-
tex of NF1SynIKO mice. Anterior-to-posterior mor-
phometric analysis of the secondary somatosensory
cortex (S2 Ctx) revealed a significant reduction in
cortical thickness in NF1SynIKO mice compared to
control (CTR) animals. The reduction was signifi-
cant particularly at caudal levels; −0.94 (P < 0.05),
−1.46, and −1.94 (P < 0.01) mm from Bregma (A). A
comparison of the average cortical thickness in
these mice showed an ∼20% decrease (P < 0.05) in
the NF1SynIKO mice (B). Despite the reduced corti-
cal thickness in mutant mice, the rest of the brain
size is comparable to that in CTR mice. Measure-
ment of the horizontal brain length, excluding the
cortex (H-Ctx) in mutant mice showed no signifi-
cant differences throughout the anterior-to-posterior
axis when compared to CTR mice (C). Quantitative
analysis of the total number of cells in the cortex
failed to demonstrate any differences because of ge-
notype (D). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

the GFAP-positive cell morphology to be typical of reac-
tive astrocytes (Fig. 8E–L; Ridet et al. 1997).

To confirm the reactive nature of NF1SynIKO astro-
cytes, we performed immunohistochemistry with a sec-
ond independent anti-GFAP antibody on thin sections
(see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure 8M–O
and Figure 8R–T, the mutant hippocampus showed in-
creased numbers of GFAP-positive astrocytes that are
hypertrophic with thicker and increased processes.
Other brain regions also showed dramatic increase in the
number of GFAP-positive astrocytes,
including the
brainstem (Fig. 8U,V), where there is little endogenous
GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 8P,Q). To quantify the de-
gree of GFAP-positive astrocyte increase, we counted
GFAP-positive cells in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
and brainstem. As indicated in Figure 9, there is 4.4-fold
increase in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in
the cerebral cortex, 1.6-fold increase in the hippocam-
pus, and ninefold increase in the brainstem of
NF1SynIKO mice as compared to the control counter-
parts.

NF1SynIKO brains do not develop neuronal
degeneration or microgliosis

The data presented above support the notion that neuron
specific loss of NF1 function leads to astrogliosis
through an indirect mechanism. Because astrogliosis is
often associated with neuronal degeneration (Ridet et al.
1997), it is possible that neuronal loss of NF1 causes
neuronal degeneration, which leads to induction of as-
trogliosis. We examined NF1SynIKO brains for evidence
of necrosis or apoptosis using Nissl staining and TUNEL
assays and were unable to detect evidence of degenerat-

ing calbindin, parvalbumin, and calretinin. We observed
no apparent abnormalities (data not shown).

To test whether high neuronal density in the mutant
cortex results in abnormal organization of dendrites and
axons, we performed Golgi staining on control and mu-
tant brains to permit visualization of individual neurons
and their dendritic arbors within the cortex (Ramon y
Cajal 1904). Golgi staining indicated that NF1SynIKO
mutant neurons have normal arborization of dendrites
and axons when compared to control counterparts (Fig.
6K,L). Collectively, these data show that NF1SynIKO mu-
tant mice have normal neuronal development but dis-
play high cell density in a reduced cerebral cortex, which
often results in less apparent lamination. The mechanis-
tic basis underlying the cortical defect remains to be elu-
cidated.

NF1SynIKO mutant brains display astrogliosis
Because neuronal development in NF1SynIKO brains is
relatively normal, we examined additional cell popula-
tions. Brains from adult control and mutant mice were
serially sectioned and subjected to immunohistochem-
istry using the astrocyte-specific anti-GFAP antibody.
Ten of ten NF1SynIKO mice displayed extensive GFAP
immunoreactivity, which reflects astrogliosis through-
out the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem
(Fig. 8). Figure 8A–D shows four levels of coronal brain
sections from rostral to caudal. The mutant brains (right
panels) showed significantly higher GFAP levels com-
pared with control counterparts (left panels). Intense
GFAP staining was especially prominent in the cerebral
cortex, where endogenous GFAP immunoreactivity is
normally low (Fig. 8A–D). High magnification showed

NF1 conditional knockouts exhibit astrogliosis

which recognizes the active form of MAP kinase. All
regions of NF1SynIKO brains showed significantly in-
creased P-erk levels as compared with controls (Fig.
10A,B). We next localized activation of MAP-kinase us-
ing immunohistochemistry. Immunoanalysis revealed
that NF1SynIKO mutant brains (Fig. 10D,F,H) contain
significantly more P-erk positive cells than do control
brains (Fig. 10C,E,G). In particular, Layers II/III and VI of
the mutant cerebral cortex showed conspicuous astro-
gliosis (Fig. 8A–D) and always had a significant increase
in number of P-erk positive cells (Fig. 10E–H). In all re-
gions examined, the large majority of P-erk positive cells
has unambiguous neuronal morphology (Fig. 10E,F,H)
and coexpress a neuronal marker, NeuN (data not
shown). Taken together, these results indicate that loss
of NF1 in neurons resulted in activation of MAP kinase
in these cells, with no evidence for similar activation in
reactive astrocytes.

Finally, to examine whether the observed increase in
the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes results from ex-
cess proliferation of glial precursors or mature astro-
cytes, we employed in vivo BrdU incorporation assays.
We examined three neonatal and three adult (5-month-
old) NF1SynIKO and control brains and failed to detect an
increase in proliferation (data not shown). The results
suggest that increased proliferation may not play a major
role in this astrogliosis model (see Discussion).

NF1SynIKO mice are tumor free
Although extensive astrogliosis was found in NF1SynIKO
brains, we failed to detect the formation of optic gliomas
and astrocytomas. In total, 29 NF1SynIKO mice were
monitored over a period of 14 mo, followed by complete
necropsy and histological analysis of the CNS. No evi-
dence of tumor appearance was uncovered (data not
shown). In the periphery, we dissected entire spinal cords
together with intact DRG from five 14-month-old
NF1SynIKO mice that were subjected to complete histo-
logical analysis and found no sign of neurofibroma for-
mation (data not shown). Thus, loss of NF1 in differen-
tiated neurons, although able to induce astrogliosis, is
not sufficient to induce the formation of gliomas or neu-
rofibromas. However, it remains undetermined whether
neuronal loss of NF1 can contribute to tumorigenesis in
combination with other genetic and/or epigenetic fac-
tors.

ing neurons (data not shown). A second normal response
to CNS injury or cell death is the induction of microglia
into the region. Microgliosis is characterized by cellular
hypertrophy and increased proliferation (Streit et al.
1999). To examine whether NF1SynIKO brains develop
microgliosis, we used an antibody against macrophage
surface antigen (anti-mac1; Rabchevsky et al. 1998) to
detect the morphology of microglia. Serial sections from
all regions of NF1SynIKO brains were compared to nor-
mal counterparts, and no evidence of microgliosis was
found (data not shown). Taken together, these results
indicate that loss of NF1 in neurons does not elicit the
classical morphological features of neuronal degenera-
tion and microgliosis but, rather, may alter normal neu-
ronal physiology, thus exerting an effect on surrounding
astrocytes (Kraig et al. 1991; Steward et al. 1991).

Loss of NF1 in neurons results in activation
of endogenous MAP kinase

Discussion

To investigate further the mechanism underlying astro-
gliosis in NF1SynIKO brains, we examined the activity of
MAP kinase, a downstream component of ras/NF1 sig-
naling that is activated in some human reactive astro-
cytes (Mandell and VandenBerg 1999). First, proteins
were extracted from different regions of NF1SynIKO and
control brains, including the cortex, hippocampus, brain-
stem, and cerebellum, and subjected to Western blot
analysis with anti-phosphorylated erk (P-erk) antibody,

The generation of knockout mice has provided insight
into the role of NF1 in developmental processes, such as
cardiac development and neuronal survival (Brannan et
al. 1994; Vogel et al. 1995). However, the early lethality
of NF1−/− mice limited these studies from extending
into later developmental stages or adulthood. The gen-
eration of NF1 conditional mutants now permits more
detailed examination of the physiological function of
NF1 both in vitro and in vivo.

In vitro

Previously, NF1 function has been studied in neurons,
Schwann cells, and fibroblasts through isolation of pri-
mary cells from NF1−/− embryos (Kim et al. 1995;
Rosenbaum et al. 1995; Vogel et al. 1995). The interpre-

tation of these studies was hampered by the inability to
distinguish a direct functional defect in mature cells
from an indirect effect resulting from developmental ab-
normalities in precursor cells. With the conditional mu-
tant, neurons or Schwann cells can be permitted to de-
velop and differentiate in the wild-type state, and abla-

tion of NF1 can be performed in mature cells, thus
separating steady-state defects from developmental ef-
fects. NF1−/− neurons generated by Cre-mediated re-
combination in culture display neurotrophin-indepen-
dent survival indistinguishable from germ-line NF1 mu-
tant DRG.
neurotrophin
independence of NF1−/− neurons directly results from
loss of NF1 function rather than abnormal differentia-
tion of NF1−/− neural crest. Another useful feature of the
NF1 conditional system is that it permits pooling of tis-
sues or cells from entire litters, thus providing adequate
amounts of material for performing biochemical assays.
For example, we were able to show that loss of NF1 in
primary Schwann cells results in increased basal levels
of MAP kinase activity (Y. Zhu and L.F. Parada, unpubl.)
as previously reported in fibroblasts and neurons (van der
Geer et al. 1997; Klesse and Parada 1998). Recent studies
from Drosophila suggest that NF1 may also regulate
cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Guo et al. 1997;
The et al. 1997). For the reasons cited above, the NF1
conditional system should provide effective means of ad-
dressing the role of NF1 in cAMP-mediated signaling
pathways in primary cells, such as neurons and Schwann
cells.

NF1 in the CNS

To date, we have observed two CNS phenotypes in
NF1SynIKO mice (cortical compression and astrogliosis).
In contrast to other brain regions, NF1SynIKO cerebral
cortices are statistically smaller by 20% than the con-
trols. One study suggested that brains of 10 NF1 patients
have abnormal cortical lamination (Rosman and Pearce
1967). Whether less apparent lamination in both mouse
and human results from increased neuronal density re-
mains to be determined. Nonetheless, the compression
that is found uniquely in the cerebral cortex indicates a
unique role for NF1 in cortical development. This fea-
ture may be of relevance to a diverse set of disorders
termed “micrencephally”, that result in reduced size of
forebrain and cerebellum (Hatten 1999). In this context,
recent reports of an FGF-2 mouse knockout indicated
reduction in cortical size that is apparently not associ-
ated with neurodegeneration (Dono et al. 1998). Al-
though the similarity of the phenotypes may be more
apparent than real, it remains formally possible that
FGF-2 signaling may in someway relate to NF1 function
in cortical development.

The role of NF1 in astrogliosis

In response to infection, injury, or neurodegeneration,
CNS astrocytes undergo hypertrophy, possible prolifera-
tion, and altered gene expression, including up-regula-
tion of astrocytic GFAP (Ridet et al. 1997). One postmor-
tem case study reported three NF1 patients with exten-
sive astrogliosis. However, the fact that two of the
patients had undergone chemotherapy has confounded
the interpretation of the underlying cause (Nordlund et
al. 1995). Two recent reports have suggested that some

NF1 conditional knockouts exhibit astrogliosis

NF1 heterozygous mutant mice may have increased
GFAP-positive astrocytes (Gutmann et al. 1999; Rizvi et
al. 1999). In one instance, mild increases (40%) were re-
ported throughout the brain (Gutmann et al. 1999),
whereas a second study reported significant increases
only in the periaqueductal gray and nucleus accumbens
with little evidence in other structures (Rizvi et al.
1999). We were unable to detect evidence of significantly
increased GFAP-positive cells in heterozygous NF1+/−
mice (see Materials and Methods). Our results provide
the first direct evidence that loss of both NF1 alleles in
neurons is sufficient and required to induce astrogliosis
in the CNS. These data do not support the idea that
haploinsufficency could lead to this phenotype.

Critical to our conclusions is the specificity of the syn-
apsin promoter–Cre transgenic mouse that is employed
in this study. We therefore employed detailed and ex-
haustive immunohistochemical assays to assess the ex-
pression of lacZ reporters, of endogenous NF1, and of Cre
recombinase in the context of two independently derived
LacZ indicator mouse strains (␤-actin/LacZ and Rosa26–
LacZ), as well as in NF1SynIKO mice.

Finally, activation of MAP kinase was only observed
in neurons, not astrocytes, thus further supporting that
ras activation only occurred in neurons of NF1SynIKO
mice. In an ongoing study, we have ablated NF1 in neu-
ral precursor stem cells, which results in NF1 loss in
both mature neurons and glia (Y. Zhu, P. Ghosh, A.
Messing, and L.F. Parada, in prep.). The morphological
phenotypes in the CNS of these mice are distinct from
that of this study, and importantly, the astrocytes dis-
play conspicuous MAPK activation, which is never ob-
served in NF1SynIKO astrocytes. We therefore conclude
that loss of NF1 is neuron specific and results in non-cell
autonomous consequences.

A unique model for astrogliosis and learning disability
To date, NF1SynIKO mice give no evidence of neurofi-
bromas or optic gliomas that are common features of
human NF1 (Riccardi 1999). This suggests that loss of
NF1 in differentiated neurons is not sufficient to induce
tumor development despite the ability to induce astro-
gliosis in the CNS. Ras-mediated signaling has been im-
plicated in human gliomagenesis, given that activated
mutations or amplification of the epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor (EGFR) gene have been found in a subset of
human gliomas (Schlegel et al. 1994; Hayashi et al.
1997). However, astrogliosis in NF1SynIKO mice is likely
to be mediated through pathways other than ras, given
that MAPK activation was only present in neurons and
not in reactive astrocytes. The simplest model for the
observed astrogliosis is that a paracrine effect, mediated
by NF1-deficient neurons, induces astroglial hypertro-
phy and GFAP induction (Rabchevsky et al. 1998). Al-
ternatively, loss of NF1 may induce synaptic hyperactiv-
ity, which leads to astrocyte reactivity (Kraig et al. 1991;
Steward et al. 1991). One interesting feature in this as-
trogliosis model is the absence of neuronal degeneration
and microgliosis. The fact that most known cytokines,

Zhu et al.

such as CNTF and interleukin-6 (IL-6), can induce both
astrogliosis and microgliosis suggests the existence of a
unique signal from NF1-deficient neurons that only ac-
tivates astrocytes, but not microglia (Ridet et al. 1997).
Among the known transgenic models, TGF␣ is the only
identified cytokine that, when overexpressed in brain,
leads to astrogliosis but not to microgliosis (Rabchevsky
et al. 1998). The fact that TGF␣ binding to EGFR pre-
sumably activates the downstream MAPK pathway in
reactive astrocytes suggests that TGF␣ is not likely to be
the inducer for astrogliosis in this context. Furthermore,
the observation that there is no increase in proliferation
during postnatal development and in adults suggests that
astrogliosis in this model is likely to be a consequence of
hypertrophy and up-regulation of GFAP in preexisting
differentiated astrocytes. This notion is consistent with
the following two observations: There is no increase in
the total number of cells and neurons in the mutant
cortex; and the areas that contain lower numbers of en-
dogenous GFAP-positive astrocytes, such as the cortex
and brainstem, show more dramatic astrogliosis than
those areas that have higher numbers of GFAP-positive
astrocytes, such as the hippocampus. However, it re-
mains possible that increased proliferation occurs in mu-
tant brains some time between P0 and 5 mo of age. These
observations suggest that neuronal loss of NF1 leads to
the activation of MAP kinase, exerting a signal to acti-
vate surrounding astrocytes, including up-regulation of
GFAP. Future identification of this unique inducer will
shed new insight into the underlying mechanism of as-
trogliosis and neuronal/glial interactions.

Preliminary

The fact that 30%–65% of NF1 children have learning
disabilities (North 1999) and that NF1 is highly ex-
pressed in both embryonic and adult neurons (Daston
and Ratner 1992; Daston et al. 1992; Huynh et al. 1994)
suggests that NF1 may have an important role in CNS
development.
that
NF1SynIKO mice also display severe learning disability
(Y. Zhu, R. Costa, L.F. Parada, and A.J. Silva, unpubl.). It
will be of interest to determine whether learning disabil-
ity is the consequence of activated ras/MAPK pathway
in neurons or of astrogliosis interfering with synaptic
function. Thus, NF1SynIKO mice may provide a unique
model for one aspect of human NF1—learning disability.
Finally, through the use of two novel mouse strains
(NF1flox and Syn–Cre Tg), this study underscores the
importance of revisiting retrospective studies of astro-
gliosis in individuals with NF1. Correlation of this phe-
notype to those patients with learning disabilities may
provide a key to dissecting the physiological basis for
this important problem.

CGGAATTCCGACT). The SacI–XbaI linker was subcloned
into the pJax34 plasmid containing a pGKneo cassette (Jackson
lab). The EcoRI fragment containing the pGKneo and a loxP site
retrieved from the above construct was subcloned into the
EcoRI site of an 8.6-kb HindIII–PstI NF1 genomic DNA (Fig.
1A). The resultant construct is designated pYZ05. The same
SacI–XbaI linker was subcloned into 5⬘ of 1.0-kb PstI–HindIII
NF1 genomic DNA and designated pYZ04. The insert of the
pYZ04 construct was modified at both ends with NotI linkers
and subcloned into the NotI site of pYZ05. The resultant con-
struct is designated pYZ07. The 11.6-kb HindIII fragment from
the pYZ07 construct was subcloned into a modified pBS-KSII
vector containing a thymidine kinase cassette. The final con-
struct is designated pYZ08D (Fig. 1A). ClaI linearized targeting
vector was transfected into R1 ES cells (Zhu et al. 1998).

Molecular analysis

NF1flox mice were genotyped by either Southern analysis (Fig.
1C,D) or a three-oligonucleotide primer PCR assay. Two prim-
ers (P1 and P3) from intron 30 of the NF1 gene were designed to
detect a 480-bp band from the WT allele; a third primer (P4)
from the neo gene and P1 were used to amplify a 350-bp band
from the flox allele (Fig. 2A). PCR was performed under the
following conditions: 0.25 mM of dNTPs, 3.0 mM of MgCl2, 0.2
µM of primers, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (GIBCO); and the
program: 1 cycle of 94°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min;
55°C for 2 min; and 72°C for 3 min; and followed by 72°C for 4
min. A sensitive PCR assay for detecting Cre-mediated recom-
bination and completion of deletion was established as the fol-
lowing: Two primers (P1 and P2; Fig. 2A) were used to detect a
280-bp band that resulted from Cre-mediated recombination in
the NF1flox allele. The P1 and P4 primers were used to detect
the completion of Cre-mediated recombination. The PCR con-
ditions are identical to that for NF1flox genotyping. Genotyping
the Cre transgene was carried out by a PCR assay under the
following conditions: 1.25 mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.4
µM of primers, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (GIBCO); and the
program: 1 cycle of 94°C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec;
65°C for 30 sec; and 72°C for 1 min; and followed by 72°C for 2

Primary culture

E13.5 NF1flox/flox or flox/− embryos were dissected, and DRG
neurons were isolated and cultured in the presence of NGF (10
ng/mL, GIBCO) as described (Vogel et al. 1995). Four hours after
plating, the DRG cultures were either infected with LacZ- and
Cre-adenovirus at MOI = 50 or mock infected. Three days later,
NGF was removed from the culture by serial dilution and ad-
dition of anti-NGF neutralizing antibody (150 µg/mL, Boeh-
ringer Mannheim). Neuronal counts were performed every 24 hr
for 5 d after plating.

Two oligos were designed to generate a SacI–XbaI linker con-

apsin I promoter and 100 bp of 5⬘ untranslated CAT sequence.
This was placed immediately 5⬘ of a modified bacteriophage P1
Cre recombinase gene that included translational consensus
and nuclear localization signals. The human growth hormone
gene was placed 3⬘ of Cre to provide transcription termination
and polyadenylation signals. The transgene was isolated from
plasmid sequence by NotI digestion and injected into pronuclei
of fertilized C57BL/6 × CBA (F2) zygotes. Four independent
lines were produced (667, 671, 675, 679) and maintained in the
C57BL/6 background for more than three generations. E11.5,
E12.5, and E13.5 embryos from the cross of LacZ reporter and
SynI–Cre Tg mice were dissected and subjected to ␤-gal histo-
chemical analysis as described (Zhu et al. 1998). SynI–Cre/LacZ
double heterozygotes were anesthetized and perfused with PBS
followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight, followed by
dehydration in 30% sucrose at 4°C for 48 h. Cryostat sections
were prepared and subjected to double-labeling immunohisto-
chemistry.

The control and conditional mutant mice

The control mice that were used in this report are the pool of
phenotypically indistinguishable mice with three genotypes:
NF1flox/flox, NF1+/+;SynI–Cre and NF1flox/+;SynI–Cre. The
conditional mutant mice include both NF1flox/flox;SynI–Cre
and NF1flox/KO;SynI–Cre mice, which also have similar phe-
notypes.

Size and weight analysis of NF1SynIKO mice

NF1SynIKO and control littermates were used to determine
overall body size (horizontal and vertical dimensions in cm) and
weight (g), as well as size of several internal organs including
kidney, liver, and spleen. The brain was separated into forebrain
and hindbrain for analysis.

Golgi-Cox staining

Animals were perfused with 0.9% buffered saline and their
brains immersed in 40 mL of Golgi-Cox solution (Glaser and
Van der Loos 1981) for 14 d. The brains were then vibratome-
sectioned at 100 µm in PBS, mounted, and stained following a
modified protocol (Kolb and McClimans 1986).

Immunohistochemistry

Free-floating sections were either cut at 50 µm on a freezing
microtome or cut at 75 µm on a vibrotome. Paraffin sections
were cut at 5 µm, deparaffinized and rehydrated. The color vi-
sualization of the primary antibodies was performed with a
horseradish peroxidase system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector).
Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, washed in H2O,
dehydrated with 100% EtOH three times for 1 min each, with
xylene three times for 1 min each, and then mounted with
permount. For immunofluorescence, slides were incubated
with either Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse or Cy2-conju-
gated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies at 1:200 dilution for 45
min at room temperature. Slides were then washed with PBS
four times each and mounted with immu-mount (Shandon).
The dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study were:
LacZ (1:100, 5⬘ and 3⬘), NeuN (1:500, Chemicon), MAP2 (1:100,
Sigma), calbindin (1:1000, SWant), parvalbumin (1:2000,
SWant), GFAP (anti-mouse, 1:100, Pharmingen), GFAP (anti-
rabbit, 1:5000, DAKO), mac1 (anti-mouse, 1:250, Chemicon),
Cre (1:200, Novaden), NF1 (a gift from Nancy Ratner, 1:2000;

David Gutmann, 1:100), P-erk (Biolabs, 1:200), and S100 (Signet,
1:1000).

Morphometric analysis of cerebral cortex

Cryostat sections were serially cut at 50-µm thickness and sub-
jected to H&E staining and NeuN immunoanalysis. Five coro-
nal brain sections per animal (n = 5 per genotype) were evalu-
ated at 500-µm intervals from 0.2 mm to −1.94 mm with respect
to Bregma according to a stereotaxic atlas of the mouse brain
(Franklin and Paxinos 1997). The thickness of the S2 somato-
sensory cerebral cortex, as well as the horizontal distance from
left–right corpus callosum at mid dorsal-to-ventral level, were
measured using an ocular micrometer. A subset of these tissue
sections was digitized at 20× magnification (three frames per
section) throughout the entire cerebral cortex, and the total cell
number was quantified manually from printouts.

Cell counts

For astrocyte counts, cryostat sections from brains (4–6 mo old)
were serially cut at 50-µm thickness and subjected to GFAP
immunohistochemistry as described above. The number of
GFAP-positive cells was counted in one out of each seven sec-
tions. For the cerebral cortex, the regions containing motor and
somatosensory cortex were chosen; for the hippocampus, a rect-
angle covering both CA1 and dentate gyrus was introduced, and
the number of GFAP-positive cells was determined in the rect-
angle of each section. For the brainstem, the regions containing
the facial nucleus were analyzed.

Western blot analysis

Brains were dissected into regions including cortex, hippocam-
pus, brainstem, and cerebellum and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Proteins were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis
as previously described (Klesse and Parada 1998). The dilutions
of primary antibodies used were: P-erk (1:1000, Biolabs) and erk
(1:5000, Santa Cruz). Densitometry analysis was performed
with the Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometry
(300A).

Statistical analysis

The values were compared using a two-way ANOVA (Super
ANOVA program, Abacus Concepts) to evaluate for differences
caused by phenotype and anterior-to-posterior level. One-way
ANOVA with these two variables combined, followed by Stu-
dent-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test, was used to determine dif-
ferences in individual groups. P-values < 0.05 were considered
to be significant.

BrdU assay and tumor analysis

Neonatal mutant and control littermates (P0) were pulsed with
BrdU for 2 h and adult (5-month-old) mice were pulsed with
BrdU five times at 2-h intervals. The dose of BrdU was 50 µg/g
(body weight). BrdU-treated mice were fixed and processed as
described above. BrdU immunohistochemistry was performed
as described previously (Zhu et al. 1998). The dilution of pri-
mary BrdU antibody was 1:50 (Becton Dickinson).

In total, 29 NF1SynIKO mice were monitored over a period of
14 mo. Complete necropsy was performed under a dissecting
microscope, and the brains were subjected to histological analy-
sis (see above). Five of these 29, 14-month-old mice were per-
fused as described above, and spinal column was postfixed in

4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. The next day, the entire
spinal cords with DRGs were dissected and fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde at 4°C overnight. Fixed tissues were then pro-
cessed and paraffin embedded. Paraffin sections were serially
cut at 5-µm thickness, stained with H&E, and examined under
light microscope.
