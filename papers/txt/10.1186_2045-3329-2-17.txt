Abstract

Background: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare tumours known to occur at high
frequency in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), but may also occur in other cancer prone syndromes.
Methods: The North West Regional Genetic Register covers a population of 4.1 million and was interrogated for
incidence of MPNST in 12 cancer prone syndromes. Age, incidence and survival curves were generated for NF1.
Results: Fifty two of 1254 NF1 patients developed MPNST, with MPNST also occurring in 2/181 cases of
schwannomatosis and 2/895 NF2 patients. Three cases were also noted in TP53 mutation carriers. However, there
were no cases amongst 5727BRCA1/2 carriers and first degree relatives, 2029 members from Lynch syndrome
families, nor amongst 447 Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, 202 Gorlin syndrome, nor 87 vHL cases.
Conclusion: MPNST is associated with schwannomatosis and TP53 mutations and is confirmed at high frequency
in NF1. It appears to be only increased in NF2 amongst those that have been irradiated. The lifetime risk of MPNST
in NF1 is between 9–13%.

Introduction
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) are
uncommon tumours varying substantially in clinico-
pathologic features [1]. Previous studies have shown that
20%–50% of patients with MPNST also have Neuro-
fibromatosis type 1 (NF1) [2-4]. Cutaneous MPNST is
very rare [5-7]; skin involvement is usually secondary
to local invasion or metastasis from larger underlying
tumours. Most are high grade, poorly differentiated and
aneuploid. Only half can be shown to exhibit schwannian
differentiation by immunohistochemical methods. Tu-
mours exhibiting mesenchymal primarily rhabdomyo-
sarcomatous differentiation (Triton tumour) are often
associated with NF1 [8]. The lifetime risk of MPNST in
NF1 has previously been assessed as between 8–13% [4].
However, there has been limited evidence of associ-
ation with other tumour prone disorders, with only case

reports showing associations with TP53 mutations [9]
and schwannomatosis[10]. We have reviewed our genetic
register databases for presence of MPNST amongst af-
fected cases and for non-syndromic conditions their first
degree relatives (FDRs). The conditions studied are sum-
marised in Table 1.

Methods
The North West Regional Genetic Register covers a re-
gion of North West England, based around Manchester,
with a population of 4.1 million. The genetic register ser-
vice covers a number of tumour predisposing syndromes
in particular NF1, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), Fa-
milial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), Gorlin syndrome,
von Hippel Lindau disease and non-syndromic families
with BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 muta-
tions. The register is highly ascertained for NF1, NF2, FAP,
Gorlin syndrome von Hippel Lindau disease [11]. In ad-
dition there is a regional database of TP53 mutation car-
riers and an international database for schwannomatosis
patients referred into the Manchester laboratory for
SMARCB1 mutation analysis. All the registries have been
the subject of cancer verification using the regional

North West Cancer Intelligence Service (NWCIS). We
have previously published risks of cancers in Lynch syn-
drome [12] and cancer incidence in BRCA1 and BRCA2
carriers [13]. The NWCIS ascertains patients with ma-
lignancies of all sites, as well as benign central nervous
system tumours, from pathology records and death cer-
tificates. We previously reviewed the Cancer Register for
patients with MPNST (ICD-0: M9540/3 and 9560/3)
from 1984–1996 [4]. We reviewed hospital notes for all
patients with MPNST who were identified for the study.
To corroborate a diagnosis of NF1, histology reports and
details of other typical NF1 disease features were re-
viewed (e.g., café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas with
respect to the U.S. National Institutes of Health diag-
nostic criteria[11]). As a diagnosis is straightforward in
most cases of NF1, NF2, vHL, Gorlin syndrome and
FAP only affected cases were used in the analysis. As
previously we also used all FDRs of known mutation
carriers for Lynch syndrome (MSH2, MLH1, MSH6) [12]
and BRCA1/2 [14] as 50% of these are likely to carry the
pathogenic mutation.

Death details from the registries were used to calcu-
late survival rates, and death certificates were reviewed
to determine cause of death. Follow-up was censored on
1st April 2010. MPNST incidence curves were derived
for NF1 for strict regional residents to avoid ascertain-
ment bias. Five-year survival was determined using
Kaplan-Meier curves. NF1 MPNST cases who were
identified on the periphery of the region during the
study period were included for the survival analysis only.
The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon (Gehan) stat-
istic were used to test between-group differences in age
at diagnosis and survival.

Results
The presence of MPNST among the study populations is
shown in Table 2. There were no instances of MPNST

amongst 5727 BRCA1/2 carriers and first degree rela-
tives, nor among 2029 Mismatch Repair mutation car-
riers and first degree relatives from Lynch syndrome
families. As the annual rate of MPNST is about 1.25 per
million [4] the lifetime risk in the general population
would be about 1 in 10,000. There could be some con-
fidence therefore that MPNST does not occur at in-
creased incidence in BRCA1/2 carriers but not yet in
Lynch syndrome. There were also no cases amongst
vHL, Gorlin or FAP patients although numbers were
smaller. The presence of two male cases with MPNST
aged 32 (retro-orbital) and 33 years (lower limb) and
one female case of triton tumour aged 5 years amongst
carriers of a 524 G > A (Arg175His), a 574delC and a
375 G > A TP53 mutation respectively suggests a likely
association with Li Fraumeni syndrome. The 375 G > A
mutation affects the invariant splice donor site CG/g >
CA/g in exon 4. The missense and splicing mutation
were inherited, but the framshift deletion de novo. There
were also a further three benign nerve sheath tumours
in three further unrelated TP53 mutation carriers aged
33 years (Vestibular schwannoma) and two paraspinal/
extra-dural at ages 50 and 49 years. There were also
three cases with schwannomatosis and MPNST. Two of
these occurred in a family with a c.846 C > G, p.N288K
SMARCB1 mutation that we have previously reported as
probably pathogenic [15]. It appears this Australian fam-
ily has been reported as part of a hospital series, but
they were not noted to have a SMARCB1 mutation [10].
Both had high grade MPNSTs with one now metastatic
aged 27 years and the other having died aged 17 years.
A third case in an individual with multiple spinal (5)
schwannomas and a peripheral schwannoma occurred
aged 46 from which he died. SMARCB1 mutation ana-
lysis was not possible. There were two cases occurring
amongst 921 NF2 patients. Both of these have been
reported as having occurred after radiation treatment

curred in unirradiated NF2 patients.

There were 52 cases of MPNST amongst our NF1
patients including 43/1059 patients within the strict re-
gional.boundaries of the Cancer Register. Fifteen cases
of MPNST have occurred in the strict regional popula-
tion since 1996 maintaining an incidence rate of above 1
per 1000 NF1 patient per year as 1010 NF1 patients
were alive at some point after 1996.

NF1 MPNST lifetime risk
Within the strict regional population of 1059 individuals
the cumulative risk of MPNST was 11.7% (95% CI 9.7–
13.7%) by age 70 years (figure 1). The robustness of inci-
dence beyond 70 years is influenced by a single case in a

tients living beyond 70 years.

Discussion
The association between MPNST and NF1 has long been
documented [2-4,18-22]. The present report doubles the
size of our previous report of MPNST in NF1 [4] and
provides further confirmation for the lifetime risk esti-
mates. As only cases with MPNST within the strict
highly ascertained borders of the region are included
these remain robust. There have been fifteen MPNSTs
in our regional population in the fourteen years since
our last population based study [4]. The annual
inci-
dence of above 1 per 1000 NF1 patients has been main-
tained over now a 27-year period. The lifetime risk of
MPNST in NF1 is estimated at 11.7% with tighter confi-
dence intervals than previously. Survival remains poor in
NF1 with only one third of patients alive at 5 years post
diagnosis. This is in accordance with our previous publi-
cation [4]. Although we have also recently reported an
improved survival in recent years (since 1996) and sig-
nificantly better survival in females versus males (5-year
survival 46% vs 22%) with NF1 [23]. MPNST remains
the single biggest contributing factor to reduced life ex-
pectancy in NF1 [16,18,24].

In addition to the known link with NF1 this study has
confirmed probable links with schwannomatosis and
germline TP53 mutations. The presence of three proven
MPNSTs in only 181 schwannomatosis patients is very
suggestive of an association. The main difficulty with
this association is the previous problems with classifying
schwannomatosis [25-27]. However, the presence of two
MPNSTs in a family with a proven SMARCB1 mutation
suggests that this is a real
link. It also broadens the
tumour spectrum in families with SMARCB1 mutations.
There remains a question as to why children with cer-
tain SMARCB1 mutations have a very high risk of the

highly Malignant atypical teratoid Rhabdoid tumours
[28] whereas other families appear to get only schwan-
nomas [15] although meningiomas also occur at a vari-
able frequency [15,29,30].

The presence of three confirmed TP53 mutation car-
riers with MPNST makes a link with germline TP53
mutations and Li Fraumeni syndrome very likely. It is
quite possible that cases of MPNST are buried amongst
reports of soft tissue sarcoma [31]. It is therefore likely
that occult/unrecognized LFS patients/families could
come to light from performing TP53 analysis on MPNST
patients. Both the cases of MPNST occurred after the
previous report from our group [31]. Nonetheless the
only clear report of a TP53 mutation was a case of Triton
tumour in a three year old [9]. This report also suggests
that this was the first such case in the literature whereas
the further triton tumour case in our series was evident
from our previous report [31].

The link between NF2 and MPNST is controversial
[16,17,32-35]. There have been a number of reports of
MPNST following radiation therapy [16,17,33] in NF2,
but only two reports of apparently spontaneous MPNST
without radiotherapy [34,36]. The first report is, none-
theless, questionable as it describes multifocal MPNST
in addition to neurofibromata, which would be more
consistent with NF1 than NF2. The second describes a
patient with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma that de-
veloped contralateral cranial MPNST[36] as such neither
report refers to a patient with proven NF2. The first re-
port[34] also describes the possibility of a constitutional
TP53 mutation, which in addition to an NF1 mutation
may cause a very substantial risk of MPNST. Indeed
TP53 mutations have been described in the transform-
ation from benign schwannoma to MPNST [32]. Al-
though the risk of MPNST appears to be higher in TP53
mutation carriers this will need to be confirmed in larger
studies.

Up to 50% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mours in non NF1 patients harbour NF1 mutations [37].
There is a broad spectrum of NF1 mutations in MPNST
and in the germline of those NF1 patients that develop
MPNST [38,39]. Although the risk of MPNST appears
to be substantially higher in individuals with large dele-
tions removing the NF1 gene [40], these patients still
only make up a small proportion of all cases of MPNST
in NF1 [38,39]. A better test needs to be derived to tar-
get a high risk population in NF1 for screening. It is pos-
sible that assessing whole body tumour burden and
particularly the extent of large deep seated tumours at
age 15–20 years may detect a sub-population at enhanced
risk [41]. Whilst MRI can detect volumetric changes
that may presage malignant change, Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) is the most sensitive and specific test
to determine if a tumour has become malignant [42,43].

Nonetheless the significant dose of radiation involved in
PET means this should not be used in routine screening
in a cancer prone syndrome [16]. Detection of a subset
at risk by genetic analysis and whole body MRI followed
by regular MRI of suspicious lesions for increased volu-
metric growth alongside greater patient awareness may
improve survival from the current poor levels in NF1.

The poor survival from MPNST particularly in NF1
patients highlights the need for therapies targeted at the
main underlying genetic abnormality. Whole genome se-
quencing is likely to reveal new targets for therapy and
the fast reducing cost of such testing may mean that it
will be affordable in the clinic within the next 5 years.

In conclusion MPNST appears to occur at increased
frequency in schwannomatosis and in those with germ-
line TP53 mutations as well as those with NF1. Radi-
ation treatment particularly in childhood increases the
risk of MPNST in NF1 and may also cause MPNST to
occur in NF2.
