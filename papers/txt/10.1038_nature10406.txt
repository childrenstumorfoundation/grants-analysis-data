Mirror extreme BMI phenotypes associated with
gene dosage at the chromosome 16p11.2 locus

doi:10.1038/nature10406

A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper

Both obesity and being underweight have been associated with
increased mortality1,2. Underweight, defined as a body mass index
(BMI) # 18.5 kg per m2 in adults and # 22 standard deviations
from the mean in children, is the main sign of a series of hetero-
geneous clinical conditions including failure to thrive3–5, feeding
and eating disorder and/or anorexia nervosa6,7. In contrast to
obesity, few genetic variants underlying these clinical conditions
have been reported8,9. We previously showed that hemizygosity of a
600-kilobase (kb) region on the short arm of chromosome 16
causes a highly penetrant form of obesity that is often associated
with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities10. Here we show that
the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with being
underweight. We identified 138 duplication carriers (including
132 novel cases and 108 unrelated carriers) from individuals
clinically referred for developmental or intellectual disabilities
(DD/ID) or psychiatric disorders, or recruited from population-
based cohorts. These carriers show significantly reduced postnatal
weight and BMI. Half of the boys younger than five years are
underweight with a probable diagnosis of failure to thrive, whereas
adult duplication carriers have an 8.3-fold increased risk of being
clinically underweight. We observe a trend towards increased
severity in males, as well as a depletion of male carriers among
non-medically ascertained cases. These features are associated with
an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive eating
behaviours and a significant reduction in head circumference.
Each of the observed phenotypes is the converse of one reported
in carriers of deletions at this locus. The phenotypes correlate with
changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the duplica-
tion but not in flanking regions. The reciprocal impact of these
16p11.2 copy-number variants indicates that severe obesity and
being underweight could have mirror aetiologies, possibly through
contrasting effects on energy balance.

Copy-number variants (CNVs) at the 16p11.2 locus have been asso-
ciated with cognitive disorders including autism (deletions) and schizo-
phrenia (duplications)11–13, conditions that have been suggested to lie at
opposite ends of a single spectrum of psychiatric phenotypes14. We and
others have reported that a deletion of this region spanning 28 genes
(Supplementary Table 1) increases the risk of morbid obesity 43-fold
(Supplementary Fig. 1)10,15. We hypothesized that the reciprocal
duplication, with its resulting increase in gene dosage, may influence
BMI in a converse manner. The duplication was identified in 73 out of
31,424 patients with DD/ID, a frequency consistent with previous
reports13 (Table 1). Four additional cases were identified among 1,080
patients affected by bipolar disease or schizophrenia. Compared to its
prevalence in seven European population-based genome-wide asso-
ciation study (GWAS) cohorts16–18 (31 out of 58,635 individuals), the
duplication was significantly more frequent in both the DD/ID cohorts
(P 5 4.23 3 10213; odds ratio 5 4.4, 95% confidence interval 5 2.9–
6.9) and the psychiatric cohorts (P 5 3.6 3 1023; odds ratio 5 7.0,
95% confidence interval 5 1.8–19.9) (Table 1), strengthening previous
reports of similar associations12,13. Our data do not support a two-hit
model19 for the effects of 16p11.2 duplications or deletions (Supplemen-
tary Text and Supplementary Table 2).

We compared available data on weight, height and BMI for 106
independent duplication carriers (including published cases) to data
for reference populations matched for gender, age and geographical
location (Table 2, Methods and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The
duplication was strongly associated with lower weight (mean Z-score
20.56; P 5 4.4 3 1024) and lower BMI (mean Z-score 20.47;
P 5 2.0 3 1023) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5). Birth para-
meters (n 5 48) were normal, indicating a postnatal effect. Adults
carrying the duplication had a relative risk of being clinically under-
weight (BMI ,18.5) of 8.3 (95% confidence interval 5 4.4–15.9,
P 5 1.53 3 10210) (see Methods). Concordantly, none of the 3,544
patients in our obesity cohorts10,15 carried the duplication (Table 1).
To investigate these associations further, we carried out separate
analyses of carrier patients (DD/ID and psychiatric) and non-medically
ascertained carriers (population-based cohorts, plus 11 transmitting
parents and three other affected first-degree relatives for whom data
were available) (Table 2). Each category had significantly lower weight
and BMI, with similar effect sizes. However, the proportion of under-
weight cases (BMI # 22 s.d.) was higher in the first group than in the
second group (17 out of 76 compared to 2 out of 40; P 5 0.017). Note
that the impact of the duplication on underweight status might be
underestimated here owing to prescription of antipsychotic treatments
that are often associated with weight gain20 (Supplementary Table 6).
Having demonstrated an association of the duplication with being
underweight, we investigated the implications of gender for the resulting
phenotypes (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7).
In DD/ID patients, the impact of the duplication on being underweight
is stronger in males; the effect in females is in the same direction, but is
smaller and not statistically significant (Table 2). A similar and signifi-
cant difference (P 5 0.0168) was observed in adult carriers (all groups
combined): the relative risk of being underweight for males is 23.2
(95% confidence interval 5 9.1–59.3, P 5 4.6 3 10211); for females it
is only 4.7 (95% confidence interval 5 1.9–11.8, P 5 9.9 3 1024). A
gender bias was also observed in the ascertainment of DD/ID duplica-
tion carriers, in which we have an excess of males (51 males:33 females,
P 5 0.044). By contrast, carriers from the general population showed a
strong overrepresentation of females (10 males:21 females, P 5 0.035)
(Supplementary Text). A similar bias was observed among transmit-
ting parents (7 males:23 females, P 5 5.53 3 1024). Thus, there is an
overrepresentation of males in the medically ascertained group, and a
depletion in the non-medically ascertained one. We suggest that males
may be more likely than females to present severe phenotypes, and that
this may account for the gender bias because severely affected males
may be less likely to be recruited to adult population cohorts or to be
reproductively successful.

As previously reported21, the duplication was also associated with
reduced head circumference (mean Z-score 20.89; P 5 7.8 3 1026)
(Fig. 1), 26.7% presenting with microcephaly (head circumference #
22 s.d.), whereas carriers of the reciprocal deletion had an increased
head circumference (mean Z-score 10.57; P 5 1.79 3 1025) (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 8): an additional instance
of a mirror phenotype associated with reciprocal changes in copy
number at this locus. Notably, head circumference Z-scores correlate

positively with those of BMI in carriers of both the duplication
(rho 5 0.37; P 5 2.65 3 1023)
and the deletion (rho 5 0.42;
P 5 1.9 3 1025) (Supplementary Methods). This indicates that head
circumference and BMI may be regulated by a common pathway, or
that a causal relationship exists between these two traits in these
patients. Alternatively, the two phenotypes may arise from distinct
genes and pathways. A full list of malformations and secondary phe-
notypes reported in duplication carriers ascertained for DD/ID is
available in Supplementary Table 9.

In view of the importance of modified eating behaviours in obesity
and being underweight, the clinical reports of duplication carriers were
screened for evidence of such modified behaviours. In 11 out of 77
clinically ascertained cases, clinicians had spontaneously reported
low food intake and selective and restrictive eating behaviour, again
mirroring one of the phenotypes—hyperphagia—seen in deletion
carriers10 (Supplementary Table 6) and indicating that the duplication
may increase the risk of eating disorders. Consequently, we carried out

multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA, Supplemen-
tary Table 10) to screen for 16p11.2 rearrangements in 441 patients
diagnosed with eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia and
binge eating disorder (Table 1 and Supplementary Text). No duplications
of the entire region were identified, but one out of 109 anorexia nervosa
patients carried an atypical 136-kb duplication that encompasses the
sialophorin (SPN) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT)
genes (Supplementary Fig. 4). This single, smaller duplication does not
allow us to draw any firm conclusions, but together with other atypical
rearrangements, it may, in the future, be essential for establishing the
roles of the 28 genes within the region.

Large genomic structural variants are known to affect the expression
of genes not only within the affected region but also at a distance22–25.
Therefore, it is possible that the phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 dele-
tion and duplication individuals are due to effects on the expression of
genes mapping outside the rearranged interval, rather than to gene
dosage within the 600-kb deletion or duplication. We measured

the mean Z-scores deviated from zero. Significant differences were identified by reference to cutoffs controlling the false discovery rate at 5% (see Methods): BMI, 0.022; weight, 0.032; height, 0.025. Significant
results are indicated in bold. Data were not available for all subjects. *Relatives of probands were excluded as required, to avoid including more than one member of the same family in a single analysis. {Including

relative transcript levels of 27 genes mapping within or near to the
rearrangement, using lymphoblastoid cell
lines (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 11): six from deletion carriers, five from duplication
carriers and ten from gender- and age-matched controls (Supplemen-
tary Table 12). Expression levels correlated positively with gene dosage
for all genes in the CNV region (Fig. 2), consistent with published
partial results from adipose tissue10. Mean relative transcript levels
in deletion and duplication carriers were, respectively, 67% and
214% of the levels measured in controls (Supplementary Table 13).
Although genes proximal (centromeric) to the rearrangement interval

LETTER RESEARCH

showed no significant variation in relative transcript levels between
patients and controls (Fig. 2), distal (telomeric) genes showed a
marked alteration in relative expression. However, their expression
levels, including that of SH2B1 (for which gene dosage and a nearby
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been associated with
obesity15,26), were similarly upregulated in cell lines of both deletion
and duplication carriers, showing no apparent correlation between
transcript level and either copy number or phenotype (Fig. 2).
Although lymphoblastoid cells may not recapitulate obesity-relevant
tissues, previous experiments have shown a high degree of correlation
between expression levels in different tissues and cell lines22, indicating
that the same pathways may be similarly disrupted in different cell
lineages. Thus, any involvement of these distal genes in the control of
BMI in these subjects seems unlikely.

Our study demonstrates the power of very large screens (.95,000
samples: to our knowledge the largest of its kind so far) to characterize
the clinical and molecular correlates of a rare functional genomic vari-
ant. We demonstrate unambiguously that carrying the 16p11.2 duplica-
tion confers a high risk of being clinically underweight, and show that
reciprocal changes in gene dosage at this locus result in several mirror
phenotypes. As in the schizophrenia/autism14 and microcephaly/
macrocephaly21 dualisms, abnormal eating behaviours, such as hyper-
phagia and anorexia, could represent opposite pathological manifesta-
tions of a common energy-balance mechanism, although the precise
relationships between these mirror phenotypes remain to be deter-
mined. We speculate that head circumference (which correlates with
brain volume27), and thus neuronal circuitry, may affect cognitive func-
tion and energy balance in patients with 16p11.2 rearrangements
(possibly through eating behaviour). Consistent with this are previous
reports that a subgroup of children with microcephaly show a con-
comitant reduction in weight percentile28. Our findings also support
the observation that severe overweight and underweight phenotypes
correlate with lower cognitive functioning4,29. Thus, abnormal food
intake may be a direct result of particular neurodevelopmental di-
sorders. Although it is possible that the 16p11.2 region encodes distinct
genes specific for each trait, a more parsimonious hypothesis is that
these clinical manifestations of dysfunction of the central nervous sys-
tem are all secondary to the disruption of a single neurodevelopmental
step that is sensitive to gene dosage. Further resolution of this issue may

METHODS SUMMARY
Underweight is defined in adults as BMI # 18.5. In individuals younger than
18 years of age, it is defined as a Z-score # 22.
Statistics. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies of the
rearrangement in patients and controls. Z-scores were computed for all data using
gender-, age- and geographically-matched reference populations. One-tailed
Student’s t-test was performed to test BMI, height, weight and head circumference
in duplication carriers for Z-scores of less than zero. We used Kruskal–Wallis tests
for differences in gene expression patterns. P-values were adjusted using a
Bonferroni correction, considering the number of pairwise comparisons; the result-
ing adjusted P-value was less than 0.05. The relative risk of being underweight was
calculated as the ratio of the fraction of underweight individuals among duplication
carriers versus our control group.
Discovery of CNVs. Carriers of 16p11.2 duplication and deletion were identified
through various procedures: (1) comparative genomic hybridization with Agilent
44K, 60K, 105K, 180K, 244K arrays; (2) Illumina Human317, Human370,
HumanHap550, Human610 and 1M BeadChips; (3) Affymetrix 6.0, 500K geno-
typing arrays; (4) quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments
(QMPSF); (5) fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH); (6) MLPA. CNV analyses
of GWAS data were carried out using cnvHap, a moving-window average-intensity
procedure, a Gaussian mixture model, circular binary segmentation, QuantiSNP,
PennCNV, BeadStudio GT module and Birdseed. At least two independent algo-
rithms were used for each cohort.
Expression analyses. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from carriers and
controls. SYBR Green quantitative PCR was performed to assess relative expres-
sion of genes.

METHODS
Study cohorts. For the description of these cohorts, refer to Supplementary
Information.
CNV detection. Cases ascertained for intellectual disabilities and developmental
delay were identified through standard medical diagnostic procedures. CNV ana-
lyses of GWAS data were variously carried out using cnvHap31; a moving-window
average-intensity procedure; a Gaussian mixture model (Valsesia et al., submitted);
circular binary segmentation32,33; QuantiSNP34; PennCNV35; BeadStudio GT module
(Illumina Inc.); and Birdseed36 (see below). At least two independent algorithms were
used for each cohort.
Patients referred for intellectual disabilities and developmental delay. All
diagnostic procedures (CGH, quantitative PCR and/or quantitative multiplex
PCR of short fluorescent fragments) were carried out according to the relevant
guidelines of good clinical laboratory practice for the respective countries. All
rearrangements in probands were confirmed by a second independent method
and karyotyping was performed in all cases to exclude a complex rearrangement.
Northern Finland 1966 birth cohort (NFBC). CNV calling has been previously
described10. In brief, data were normalized using Illumina BeadStudio, then GC
effects on ratios were removed by regressing on GC and GC2, and wave effects
were removed by fitting a Loess function37. CNV analysis was done using
cnvHap31. All called 16p11.2 duplications were validated by direct analysis of
log2 ratios. Data for each probe were normalized by first subtracting the median
value across all samples (so that the distribution of ratios for each probe was
centred on zero), and then dividing by the variance across all samples (to correct
for variation in the sensitivity of different probes to copy-number variation). All
CNV calls were confirmed by MLPA.
deCODE genetics. Illumina Human317, Human370, HumanHap550, Human610
and 1M BeadChips were used for CNV analysis. BeadStudio (version 2.0) was used
to call genotypes, normalize the signal intensity data and establish the log R ratio
(LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) at every SNP according to standard Illumina
protocols. All samples passed a standard SNP-based quality control procedure
with a SNP call rate greater than 0.97. PennCNV35, a free, open-source tool, was
used for detection of CNVs. The input data for PennCNV are LRR, a normalized
measure of the total signal intensity for the two alleles of the SNP, and BAF, a
normalized measure of the allelic intensity ratio of the two alleles. These values are
derived with the help of control genotype clusters (HapMap samples), using the
Illumina BeadStudio software. PennCNV employs a hidden Markov model to
analyse the LRR and BAF values across the genome. CNV calls are made on the
basis of the probability of a given copy state at the current marker, as well as on
the probability of observing a copy-state change from the previous marker to the
current one. PennCNV uses a built-in correction model for GC content38.
Cohorte Lausannoise (CoLaus). Data normalization and CNV calling have been
previously described10. Data normalization included allelic cross-talk calibration39,40,
intensity summarization using robust median average, and correction for any PCR
amplification bias. Wave effects were corrected by fitting a Loess function37. CNV
calling was done using a Gaussian mixture model (Valsesia et al., submitted) that fits
four components (deletion, copy-neutral, one additional copy and two additional
copies) to copy-number ratios. The final copy number at each probe location is
determined as the expected (dosage) copy number. The method has been validated
by comparing test data sets with results from the CNAT41 and CBS32,33 algorithms,
and by replicating a subset of CoLaus subjects on Illumina arrays. Only duplications
found by both Gaussian mixture model and CBS were considered.
Estonian genome center of the University of Tartu (EGCUT). Genotypes were
called by BeadStudio software GT module v3.1 or GenomeStudio GT v1.6
(Illumina Inc.). Values for LRR and BAF produced by BeadStudio were formatted
for further CNV analysis and break-point mapping with Hidden-Markov-Model-
based softwares QuantiSNP (ver.1.1)34 and PennCNV42 or CNVPartition 2.4.4
(Illumina Inc.). All analyses were carried out using the recommended settings,
except changing EMiters to 25 and L to 1,000,000 in QuantiSNP. For PennCNV,
the Estonian-population-specific SNP allele frequency data was used. All detected
duplications were confirmed by quantitative PCR.
Study of health in Pomerania (SHIP). Raw intensities were normalized using
Affymetrix power tools (Affymetrix); CNV analysis was done using Birdseye from
the Birdsuite software package36 and PennCNV35. PennCNV predictions with
confidence scores less than 10 were removed. Birdsuite predictions were filtered
as in ref. 15: CNVs were kept if their linkage disequilibrium (LOD) score was .10,
length .1 kb, number of probes $5 and size per number of probes ,10,000.
Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA) F3 and
F4. Genotyping for KORA F3 was performed using the Affymetrix 500K array set,
consisting of two chips (StyI and NspI). The KORA F4 samples were genotyped
with the Affymetrix human SNP array 6.0. For both studies, genomic DNA from
blood samples was used for analysis. Hybridization of genomic DNA was done in
accordance with the manufacturer’s standard recommendations. Genotyping was

LETTER RESEARCH

done in the Genome Analysis Centre of the Helmholtz Centre Munich. Genotypes
were determined using BRLMM clustering algorithm (Affymetrix 500K array set)
and Birdseed2 clustering algorithm (Affymetrix array 6.0). For quality control
purposes, we applied a positive control and a negative control DNA every 48 sam-
ples (KORA F3) or 96 samples (KORA F4). On the chip level, only subjects with
overall genotyping efficiencies of at least 93% were included. In addition, the called
gender had to agree with the gender in the KORA study database. After exclusions,
1,644 individuals remained in KORA F3 and 1,814 in KORA F4 for further
analysis.
MLPA analysis. We used MLPA to determine changes in the copy number of a
region of about 2 Mb on chromosome 16p11.2. Briefly, we designed, using hg18,
nine probes within the targeted region, one control probe outside the rearranged
region and seven control probes targeting unique position in the genome
(Supplementary Table 10). Assays were performed with MRC-Holland reagents
according to the manufacturer’s protocol43. The analysis of the amplification
products was performed by capillary electrophoresis in the DNA Analyser
3730XL and using the GeneMapper software v3.7 (Applied Biosystems). The
calculations were performed independently for each experiment: we first normal-
ized the MLPA data to minimize the amount of experimental variation, summing
all signal values of each control probe for each sample, and then dividing each
signal value of each sample by the sum. The normalized signal values were com-
pared to signal values from all other samples in the same experiment, dividing the
normalized signal values by the average calculated from all the samples in the same
experiment. The product of this calculation is termed dosage quotient (DQ). A DQ
value of less than 0.65 or more than 1.25 was considered as copy-number loss or
gain, respectively, as previously described44–46.
Custom array-CGH for the short arm of chromosome 16. DNA samples were
labelled with Cy3 and cohybridized to custom-made Nimblegen arrays with Cy5-
labelled DNA from the CEPH cell line GM12042. These arrays contained 71,000
probes spread across the short arm of chromosome 16 from 22.0 Mb to 32.7 Mb (at
a median space of 45 bp between 27.5 Mb and 31.0 Mb), and 1,000 control probes
situated in invariable regions of the X chromosome. DNA labelling, hybridization
and washing were performed according to Nimblegen protocols. Scanning was
performed using an Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner. Image processing,
quality control and data extraction were performed using the Nimblescan software
v.2.5.
Defining underweight. Underweight was defined throughout the study as
BMI # 18.5 kg per m2 in adults and # 22 s.d. in children30,47,48.
Weight, height, BMI and head circumference Z-scores as a function of age. For
paediatric cases, weight, height, BMI and head circumference Z-scores were deter-
mined for paediatric cases (0–18 years of age) using clinical growth charts specific
to the country of origin. Children were ascertained from nine different countries. If
charts were only available in percentiles, those measures were transformed into
Z-scores using gender-, age- and geographically-matched reference populations
(see Statistics).

For the USA and Canada, data from the Center for Disease Control and
National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS) were used to calculate
Z-scores49.

For the French paediatric population, we used French national growth
charts50,51. For the Swiss paediatric population, we used Swiss national growth
charts52. For Dutch participants, Dutch national growth charts were used53. For
Italian, German, Finnish and Austrian cases (n 5 6), height, weight and BMI
Z-scores were estimated using WHO growth charts54.

To check for discrepancies generated by the use of different growth charts,
height, weight and BMI Z-scores were recalculated using WHO growth charts
for all cases under five years of age, regardless of origin (http://www.who.int/
childgrowth/standards/en/54). Z-scores obtained using the WHO data were not
significantly different. These growth standards, developed by the World Health
Organization multicentre growth reference study, describe normal child growth
from birth to 5 years under optimal environmental conditions. These standards
can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic
status and type of feeding55,56.

If necessary, percentile values were transformed to Z-scores by the inverse-
normal density function. When growth charts were unavailable, we used reported
LMS parameters (median (M), generalized coefficient of variation (S) and skew-
ness (L)) to obtain Z-scores via the formula:

Estonian or French control populations. For cases identified from population-
based cohorts, Z-scores were directly inferred from the cohort.
Gene expression. We established lymphoblastoid cell lines from deletion and
duplication carriers, as well as from controls (Supplementary Table 12), by trans-
forming peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Epstein–Barr virus. Patients and
controls were enrolled after obtaining appropriate informed consent via the physi-
cians in charge, and approval by the ethics committee of the University of Lausanne.
More control cell lines were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research
(http://www.coriell.org/) (Supplementary Table 12). SYBR Green real-time quant-
itative PCR (RT–PCR) was performed as previously described22,57. Briefly, 1 mg of
total RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines was converted to complementary DNA
using Superscript VILO (Invitrogen) primed with a mixture of oligo(dT) and random
hexamers. Oligos were designed using the PrimerExpress program (Applied
Biosystems) with default parameters (Supplementary Table 11). Non-intron-
spanning assays were tested for genomic contamination in standard 6 reverse
transcriptase reactions. The amplification efficiency of each primer pair was tested
in a cDNA dilution series, as previously described58. A full list of genes mapping in
the rearranged interval, and exclusion criteria, are presented in Supplementary
Table 1. All RT–PCR reactions were performed in a 10-ml final volume and tripli-
cates per sample. The setup in a 384-well plate format was performed using a
Freedom EVO robot (TECAN) and assays were run in an ABI 7900 sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems) with the following amplification condi-
tions: 50 uC for 2 min, 95 uC for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 uC 15 s, then 60 uC for
1 min. A final incubation of 95 uC for 15 s followed by 60 uC for 15 s was carried out
to establish a dissociation curve. Each plate included the appropriate normaliza-
tion genes to control for any variability between plate runs. Raw threshold cycles
(Ct) values were obtained using SDS2.4 (Applied Biosystems). To calculate the
normalized relative expression ratio of individuals carrying the CNV and of
controls, we used Biogazelle qBase Plus software59 including geNorm60. This
program identified appropriate normalization genes (EEF1A1, RPL13, GUSB
and TBP) having a gene-stability measure of M 5 0.25. We note that one gene,
LAT, showed a very high expression profile in one of the duplication samples
(DASYL, Supplementary Table 13), reaching a relative expression value of 27.3
(s.e.m. 5 1.37), compared to an average expression for other duplications of 1.89
(s.e.m. 5 0.51). We cannot exclude that this finding is genuine (and confirmed it in
a second experiment), but it was removed from further analyses as an outlier to give
a more accurate overview of expression profiles for these genes.

In silico analysis was performed to check for brain, and specifically hypothalamus,
expression of genes in the rearranged 16p11.2 interval (Supplementary Table 1). This
was done using Allen Brain Atlas Resources, available from http://www.brain-map.

Cases with major neurological signs. Major neurological signs were defined
by moderate to severe hypotonia, hypertonia, ataxia, spasticity, hypereflexia,
hyporeflexia and/or extra-pyramidal signs, and by the presence of epilepsy.
Statistics. Student’s t-test: one-tailed t-tests were performed to test whether
duplication carriers have Z-score values lower than zero for BMI, height and
weight. We found this analysis more suitable than linear regression analysis,
correcting for confounding factors such as sex and age, because these anthro-
pometric traits have a highly nonlinear dependence on these factors, as can be
observed in control populations.

Kruskal–Wallis test: this was used to test differences in the gene expression
pattern between deletion and duplication carriers and control
individuals.
Because expression values are not necessarily normally distributed, this test is more
adequate than a classical one-way analysis of variance. To test pairwise differences,
we computed the difference in mean group rank with its 95% confidence interval
(as provided by the multcompare function in Matlab). Correction for multiple
testing was done using a Bonferroni adjustment.

Multiple testing: we determined false-discovery-rate-based thresholds for asso-
ciation P-values for each phenotype, to correct for multiple testing. For each
phenotype, we replaced the observed Z-scores with numbers randomly drawn
from a standard normal distribution and performed the same t-tests for the same
strata. The procedure was repeated 1,000 times. For various P-value thresholds, we
asked how many tests would be declared significant for the null set on average
(over the 1,000 random draws). The false discovery rate was estimated as the ratio
of this number and the actual number obtained for the observed Z-scores. Thus,
we controlled the dependence between nested tests.

Relative risk: among adults, we defined underweight as a BMI ,18.5 (WHO
criteria). The estimated relative risk is the ratio of the fraction of underweight
individuals among duplication carriers versus our control group. The standard
error of log(relative risk) and its significance were calculated as previously
described61. In our control group (population-based cohorts), the frequency of

being underweight is 1.9% (38 males and 148 females out of 9,470). Owing to the
fact that being underweight decreases with age in the general population, we
resampled our control group to ensure precise age-matching.
