Children with 59-end NF1 gene mutations
are more likely to have glioma

ABSTRACT
Objective: To ascertain the relationship between the germline NF1 gene mutation and glioma
development in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
Methods: The relationship between the type and location of the germline NF1 mutation and the
presence of a glioma was analyzed in 37 participants with NF1 from one institution (Washington
University School of Medicine [WUSM]) with a clinical diagnosis of NF1. Odds ratios (ORs) were
calculated using both unadjusted and weighted analyses of this data set in combination with 4
previously published data sets.
Results: While no statistical significance was observed between the location and type of the NF1
mutation and glioma in the WUSM cohort, power calculations revealed that a sample size of 307
participants would be required to determine the predictive value of the position or type of the NF1
gene mutation. Combining our data set with 4 previously published data sets (n 5 310), children
with glioma were found to be more likely to harbor 59-end gene mutations (OR 5 2; p 5 0.006).
Moreover, while not clinically predictive due to insufficient sensitivity and specificity, this asso-
ciation with glioma was stronger for participants with 59-end truncating (OR 5 2.32; p 5 0.005)
or 59-end nonsense (OR 5 3.93; p 5 0.005) mutations relative to those without glioma.
Conclusions: Individuals with NF1 and glioma are more likely to harbor nonsense mutations in the
59 end of the NF1 gene, suggesting that the NF1 mutation may be one predictive factor for glioma
in this at-risk population. Neurol Genet 2017;3:e192; doi: 10.1212/NXG.0000000000000192

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM162200) is characterized by substantial clinical variabil-
ity, with individuals prone to the development of numerous medical complications, ranging
from neurofibromas and bone defects to autism and nervous system tumors. The wide pheno-
typic variation seen in this disorder creates a particular challenge for clinicians when counseling
families. For this reason, there is a pressing need to identify potential predictive risk factors.

NF1 is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the NF1 locus, containing a large gene with
57 exons.1 While thousands of different NF1 gene mutations have been identified, recent studies
have suggested that genotype-phenotype correlations may exist. In particular, 2 types of NF1
mutations have been described, in which patients do not develop neurofibromas (c.2970_72de-
lAAT2; p.Arg18093). However, several groups have evaluated the predictive value of the location
of the NF1 mutation as a potential risk factor for optic glioma with conflicting conclusions.4–7
An important limitation to these analyses is the small sample size of each cohort. This is
particularly relevant to brain tumors, which arise in only ;20% of children with NF1.8,9 For
this reason, we combined participants from our own institution (Washington University School
of Medicine [WUSM] cohort) with the 4 previously published studies that used MRI scans to

determine the presence or absence of glio-
mas.4–7 As such, we performed adequately
powered unadjusted and weighted analyses
to determine the relationship between the type
and location of the NF1 mutation and glioma
in over 300 individuals with NF1.

METHODS Study population. This retrospective analysis
was performed using pre-existing clinical data in the electronic
medical records under an approved Human Studies protocol at
the WUSM. Only those participants with a known NF1 gene
mutation (performed at the University of Alabama, Birmingham
Medical Genomics Laboratory) and brain MRI (performed at
Barnes-Jewish Hospital/St. Louis Children’s Hospital) were
included in this study. A total of 37 participants met these cri-
teria: 14 participants were identified with glioma (optic, cere-
bellar, brainstem, and temporal lobe glioma) using previously
published radiographic criteria,8 while 23 did not (negative scan
after age 10 years). Deidentified data analyzed included patient
sex (male/female), family history of NF1 (yes/no), NF1 gene
mutation (DNA and predicted protein change), and glioma
(presence/absence) (table e-1 at Neurology.org/ng).

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This is a retrospective analysis performed using pre-
existing clinical data in the electronic medical records under
a WUSM-approved Human Studies protocol (IRB#201703143).
As such, no patient consent forms were required.

Statistical analysis. All categorical variables were analyzed using
x2 or Fisher exact tests (SPSS, v23). Odds ratios (ORs) were
reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), estimated using
2 3 2 contingency tables to compare outcomes (presence of
glioma) with the variant type and location within the NF1 gene.
Sensitivity analyses were performed by meta-analysis,4,6,7 exclud-
ing 1 data set that lacked a control group.5 Adjusted ORs and
associated 95% CIs were calculated using weights, based on the
inverse of the variance, while individual studies included in the
meta-analysis were assumed to be random samples of the target
population. Statistical significance was defined as a p value of
,0.05 (2 sided).

RESULTS A total of 37 individuals with identified
NF1 gene mutations were included (4 splice, 3 mis-
sense, 18 nonsense, 9 frameshift deletion, and 3
frameshift insertion mutations; WUSM cohort; table
e-1). Based on radiographic criteria,8 14 participants
had a glioma, while 23 participants did not. There
was no association between patient sex and family
history of NF1 and glioma, and 59-end (exons 1–
261) clustering of mutations in patients with glioma
was not observed. In addition, no differences were
observed when mutations were stratified by variant
type (table e-1). While there was a larger proportion
of participants with glioma who harbored mutations
predicted to cause premature protein truncation
(nonsense, frameshift insertions/deletions) compared
with participants without glioma (64.3% vs 30.4%),
no statistically significant difference between groups
was observed (p 5 0.09). Similarly, with one excep-
tion,6 no significant association between the mutation

type or location and glioma diagnosis was found
when each of the 3 previously published cohorts that
contained participants with and without glioma were
analyzed individually4,6,7 (table e-2).

A priori power analysis using the G*power
3.0.10 program (Universität Kiel, Germany) indi-
cated that a total sample of 307 participants would
be needed to detect an effect size of 0.16 with 80%
power using a x2 test to detect differences in pro-
portions with an alpha level of 0.05. Since each of
the studies are limited by small participant numbers,
we combined our data with the 4 previously pub-
lished data sets, and after excluding participants with
unknown mutations or genomic microdeletions,
101 participants with “glioma” and 209 controls
with a “no glioma” diagnosis were available (table
e-3). Using this combined data set, more 59-end
(exons 1–26) mutations were found in participants
with glioma than in controls (67.3% vs 50.7%; OR 5
2.00; 95% CI: 1.22–3.29; p 5 0.006) (figure 1A).
In addition, this significance persisted when the
OR was adjusted for sample size and heterogeneity
using a meta-analysis with control groups (n 5
296) (OR 5 2.21; 95% CI: 1.22–4.00; p 5
0.009; figure 1B and table e-4A).

When mutations were stratified by type, the
unadjusted OR for glioma was 3.93 (95% CI:
1.52–10.18; p 5 0.005; figure 2A), and following
meta-analysis, the weighted OR was 3.46 (95% CI:
1.19–10.10; p 5 0.023; figure 2B and table e-4B)
for participants with 59-end nonsense mutations.
Similarly, the unadjusted OR for glioma was 2.32
(95% CI: 1.23–4.18; p 5 0.005; figure 2C), while
the adjusted OR was 2.65 (95% CI: 1.12–6.24; p 5
0.026; figure 2D and table e-4C) in participants
with 59-end truncation mutations relative to those
with 39-end mutations. When the 3 WUSM pa-
tients with cerebellar brainstem and temporal lobe
glioma were excluded from the analyses, the signif-
icance of the findings was unchanged (table e-5). Of
note, when we expanded the 59 end to include mu-
tations within the RAS-GAP domain (exons 1–34),
the significance observed in unadjusted ORs for gli-
oma (table e-6) was lost when weighted analyses
were performed (table e-6).

The utility of these findings in the clinic setting
depends on their specificity and sensitivity in predict-
ing the presence or absence of a glioma. Unfortu-
nately, as stand-alone factors, the position and type
of the NF1 gene mutation lack sufficient specificity
(0.49, 0.71, and 0.54) or sensitivity (0.67, 0.62, and
0.67 for all 59-end, 59-end nonsense, and 59-end
truncation mutations, respectively) to enable accurate
risk assessment. This point is underscored by the
finding that the same mutation can be found in par-
ticipants with and without glioma (table e-7).

DISCUSSION In the era of precision medicine, it be-
comes critical to identify risk factors that influence dis-
ease pathogenesis and clinical variability. This problem
is illustrated by NF1, where no robust predictive factors
have been identified. Based on insights derived from the
use of NF1-patient–induced pluripotent stem cells10
coupled with emerging genotype-phenotype correla-
tions,2,3 one potential factor important for conferring
disease variability is the germline NF1 mutation. Here,

we perform the largest genotype-phenotype analysis to
determine whether the position or type of the NF1 gene
mutation is a risk factor for glioma.

First, NF1 participants who harbor NF1 muta-
tions proximal to the RAS-GAP domain are more
likely to develop gliomas, similar to two previously
published reports.5,6 Of interest, NF1 mutations pre-
dicted to produce premature stop codons were also
associated with higher glioma risk.4 This mutational

specificity could reflect the impact of the mutation on
protein expression10; however, this hypothesis will
require further mechanistic exploration.

statistical methods

Second, each of the previous analyses used differ-
ent
to look for genotype-
phenotype correlations and included only modest
numbers of participants. It is important that future
studies incorporate power calculations to determine
whether the analyses planned are sufficiently powered
to detect differences. One limitation inherent in the
combined analysis of multiple data sets is that the pre-
cise radiographic criteria used by each institution to
diagnose gliomas could vary slightly. Moreover, it is
critical to use clinically applicable analyses, such as
OR calculations,
risk factor
significance.

Finally, while 59-end mutations, and 59 nonsense
or truncation mutations in particular, are associated
with glioma, neither the location nor the mutation
type is a highly specific marker of glioma (figure 1 and
tables e-2 and e-4–e-7). We interpret this result to
indicate that the germline mutation alone is not a suf-
ficiently robust risk factor to provide prognostic

as measures

of

information to families. Future studies that incorpo-
rate multiple independently significant risk factors
may yield useful predictive assessment profiles for
children with NF1.
