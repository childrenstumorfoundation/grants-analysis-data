Abstract

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) develop sporadically or in the context of
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). EGFR overexpression has been implicated in MPNST formation,
but its precise role and relevant signaling pathways remain unknown. We found that EGFR
overexpression promotes mouse neurofibroma transformation to aggressive MPNST (GEM-
PNST). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) in both human
MPNST and mouse GEM-PNST. A specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor FLLL32 delayed MPNST
formation in an MPNST xenograft nude mouse model. STAT3 knockdown by shRNA prevented
MPNST formation in vivo. Finally, reducing EGFR activity strongly reduced pSTAT3 in vivo.
Thus, an EGFR-STAT3 pathway is necessary for MPNST transformation and establishment of
MPNST xenografts growth but not for tumor maintenance. Efficacy of the FLLL32
pharmacological inhibitor in delaying MPNST growth suggests that combination therapies
targeting JAK/STAT3 might be useful therapeutics.

Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive incurable sarcomas that
arise in 0.001% of the general population. However, the incidence of MPNST increases to
8-13% in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients (1-4). In NF1, benign peripheral nerve
plexiform and subcutaneous neurofibromas can undergo malignant transformation to
MPNSTs (5, 6). MPNSTs are a major source of mortality for NF1 patients because only
complete surgical resection is curative and complete resection is often not feasible due to
tumor location or metastasis. MPNST patients are often not sensitive to chemotherapy or
radiation therapy (1, 7).

MPNSTs derive from either neural crest cells or glial cells that dedifferentiate to a neural
crest-like cell (8-11). Hyperactive Ras, resulting from the loss function of neurofibromin, is
a major contributor of Schwann cells malignant transformation to MPNST. Indeed, mass
spectroscopy-based analysis of an MPNST cell line failed to detect mutations in 19
commonly activated oncogenes (12).

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or erbB1) is a 170 kDa transmembrane tyrosine
kinase, which triggers signaling processes that promote cell proliferation, migration,
adhesion, and angiogenesis, and inhibits apoptosis (13). While peripheral nerve Schwann
cells that might be cells of origin of MPNST do not express EGFR, Schwann cell
progenitors and MPNST cells do (DeClue et al 2000, Li et al 2002). Thus EGFR is
expressed in 80% of human MPNSTs, and most human and mouse MPNST cell lines
(14-18).

EGFR is deregulated in a variety of solid malignant tumors by overexpression of EGFR
protein, activating point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, or other mutations. In
NF1, EGFR is over-expressed – not activated by mutation (15, 18). In a compound cis-
heterozygous Nf1 and p53 (NPcis) mouse sarcoma model (9, 10), loss of EGFR function by
breeding the NPcis mouse to a mouse carrying an EGFR hypomorph in mutation Wa2
(Wa2+) (19) resulted in delayed sarcoma formation (20). Taken together the data support a
role for EGFR in MPNSTs. It is unclear, however, whether EGFR is sufficient or necessary
for MPNST malignant transformation and/or tumor maintenance.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent transcription factor that
participates in transcriptional activation of apoptosis and cell-cycle progression, and has
been implicated as an oncogene and therapeutic target in neoplastic disease (21). STAT3
phosphorylation at (Tyr705) is essential for STAT3 dimerization that, in turn, is required for
STAT3 binding to DNA-promoter regions and, thus, transcriptional activation (Battle and
Frank, 2002). The EGFR-src-STAT3 oncogenic pathway is involved in cell transformation
and tumor escape from genotoxic treatment (22). STAT3 also regulates self-renewal and
growth of glioblastoma stem cells (23).

STAT3 is hyperactivated in Nf1−/− primary astrocytes and STAT3 inhibition by
cucurbitacin-I blocked human MPNST growth in vivo when delivered for 7 days at onset of
cell xenograft (24). Whether EGFR-dependent STAT3 activation plays a role in MPNST
transformation is unknown. Here we report that EGFR overexpression in a neurofibroma
mouse model is sufficient to promote neurofibroma transformation into mouse MPNST
(GEM-PNST). STAT3 (Tyr705) was hyper-phosphorylated in mouse GEM-PNSTs and
human MPNSTs, and inhibition of STAT3 with the specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor
FLLL32, which blocks STAT3 activity both by blocking STAT3 dimerization and JAK2
interaction with STAT3 (25), delayed MPNST xenograft formation in nude mice. Short-
heparin RNA targeting STAT3 (shSTAT3) prevented MPNST xenograft tumor formation in
vivo. These data support a role for the EGFR-STAT3 pathway in MPNST transformation,
but not in tumor maintenance.

Results
Overexpression of CNP-hEGFR is sufficient to drive aggressive sarcoma formation in the
Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre neurofibroma mouse

We used a neurofibroma mouse model in which 100% of mice develop benign
neurofibromas, but there is no GEM-PNST formation (26). To test whether increased EGFR
expression is sufficient to drive GEM-PNST formation, we bred Nf1fl/+;DhhCre;CNP-
hEGFR and Nf1fl/fl mice – obtaining Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre;CNP-hEGFR and Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre mice

in the expected Mendelian ratios. All fifteen Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre;CNP-hEGFR mice developed
neurofibromas. Surprisingly, five mice (33.3%) developed visible tumors at 4-8 months of
age. These tumors were rapidly growing and either under or protruding through the skin; the
protruding tumors sometimes exhibited surface ulceration (Figure 1A). The histological and
immunohistochemical features of the rapidly growing tumors are consistent with GEM-
grade III PNST (27). In one tumor we detected a transition zone of neurofibroma [low to
moderate cellularity and nuclear atypia of rare cells, scattered S100β+ cells (Figure 1C, 1D,
1F) ] to densely cellular tumor GEM-PNST characterized by spindle-shaped cells with
numerous mitotic figures and foci of necrosis (Figure 1C, 1E). In addition, all GEM-PNSTs
showed association between nerves and scattered S100β+ cells (Figure 1G), typical of GEM-
grade III PNSTs. All GEM-grade III PNST tumors expressed the human EGFR transgene (6
of 6) (Figure 1H). The results suggest that GEM-grade III PNSTs developed from pre-
existing neurofibromas.

STAT3 is activated in human MPNSTs and mouse GEM-PNSTs

If pathways upstream of STAT3 regulate MPNST growth, pSTAT3 should be detected in
these peripheral nerve tumors. We therefore labeled paraffin sections of human MPNSTs
and mouse GEM-PNSTs with antibodies that recognize the major STAT3-phosphorylation
sites. Tyrosine 705 is necessary for STAT3 dimerization and translocation to the nucleus.
Immunopositive staining for pSTAT3 (Tyr705) was detected in all human MPNSTs (n = 15)
and mouse GEM-PNSTs (n = 6) (Figure 2A and 2B). The percentage of cells expressing
pSTAT3 (Tyr705) varied among tumors (from less than 25% to more than 75%, Figure 2C).
In contrast, detectable levels of pSTAT3 (Ser727) were found in only one of four mouse
GEM-PNSTs, and only two of four human MPNSTs (data not shown).

JAK2/STAT3 inhibition prevents MPNST cells growth in vitro

To test if STAT3 or the Stat kinases JAK 1, 2, or 3 is relevant to MPNST cell growth, we
screened JAK and JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors. We conducted a dose-response analysis of
FLLL32, a specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor (25) on five MPNST cell lines, four of which
were from NF1 patients. After four days of treatment, FLLL32 decreased cell survival in 5/5
tested cell lines. The average IC50 was around 200 nM (Figure 3C). In contrast, treatment of
normal human Schwann cells with FLLL32 (0.5μM) did not affect viability of normal
human Schwann cells (Supplemental figure 1A).

We then tested effects of JAK inhibitors on the same human MPNST cell lines. The JAK1/
AK2 inhibitor AZD1480 (Figure 3B) and JAK 1, 2, and 3 inhibitor JAK inhibitor I (Figure
3C) had similar effects as FLLL32, decreasing human MPNST cell survival. The JAK3
inhibitor CP6690550 did not affect cell viability (Figure 3D). These inhibitors had no
significant effects on cell proliferation as evidenced by BrdU incorporation (Figure 3E), but
FLLL32, JAK inhibitor I, and AZD1480 induced cell apoptosis (Figure 3F). These inhibitors
did not affect viability of normal human Schwann cells (Supplemental figure 1A). These
human MPNST cell lines exhibited very similar dose kinetics in response to JAK inhibitors
treatment because they have similar level of pSTAT3 (Tyr 705) and EGFR (Supplemental
figure 1A). We performed western blots on lysates from inhibitor treated 8814 and S462TY
cells. All the inhibitors inhibited pSTAT3 and pJAK2, but none of them affected pERK
except CP690550 (Supplemental figure 1C, 1D). These results suggest that JAK1/2
mediated STAT3 signaling contributes to MPNST cell survival. Due to the unavailability of
a specific JAK1 inhibitor, we could not differentiate if the survival effect was caused by
JAK1 or JAK2, or both. However, together with the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor FLLL32 results,
we concluded that JAK2/STAT3 inhibition can prevent MPNST cells growth.

Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 delays MPNST growth in vivo

We tested whether blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway might affect growth in an MPNST
xenograft model. We treated nude mice with S462TY MPNST tumors >250mm3 (n = 10)
with FLLL32 (200mg/kg) daily intraperitoneal injection. We sacrificed the treated mice by
23 consecutive days of treatment when the tumor size reached >10% of the mouse body
weight, and did not detect significant changes in tumor size compared to vehicle treated
controls (Figure 4A). However, when we treated the nude mice with S462TY MPNST
tumors beginning when tumors were small (average 50mm3) (n = 10) with FLLL32 (200mg/
kg) daily, tumor formation was significantly delayed (∼2 weeks) compared to vehicle
treated controls (n=12, Figure 4B, p<0.0001). These results suggest that STAT3 affects the
early stage of MPNST tumor growth.

To determine how FLLL32 delays MPNST growth, mice treated with 200mg/kg/day
FLLL32 or vehicle control for 14 days (early group) when FLLL32 is effective or 56 days
(late group) when tumors were resistant to FLLL32 were sacrificed one hour after the final
dose. We performed western blot to determine pSTAT3 levels at day 21 (2 weeks after
FLLL32 treatment) and day 56 (at the end of experiment) with or without FLLL32
treatment. pSTAT3 was low at both time points, indicated that the drug is effective at both
time points (Figure 4C). We then analyzed cell death, cell proliferation, and blood vessels in
paraffin sections of excised MPNSTs by TUNEL and Ki67 staining, respectively. In the
early group, the average percentage of TUNEL+, dying cells was 9.6±1.6% in FLLL32-
treated MPNSTs vs 6.6±0.6% in control (p<0.01, Figure 4D). There was no significant
difference in the percentage of Ki67+, proliferating cells in FLLL32-treated MPNSTs
(33.7±3.7%, n=5) compared to vehicle control (32.4±3.2%, n=5) (p=0.28, Figure 4E). In the
late group, the average percentage of TUNEL+, dying cells was 7.1±1.4% in FLLL32-
treated MPNSTs vs 2.1±0.6% in control (p<0.01, Figure 4G). There was no significant
difference in the percentage of Ki67+, proliferating cells in FLLL32-treated MPNSTs
(21.9±4.3%, n=5) compared to vehicle control (26±2.7%, n=3) (p=0.21, Figure 4H). We
also analyzed the number of blood vessels per high power field (HPF) by staining these
tumors with the endothelial cell marker MECA 32. Interestingly, there was a decrease in
blood vessels per HPF in the early stage of treatment group (p=0.04, Figure 4F), and more
effect in the late stage of treatment group (p<0.001, Figure 4I), suggesting that decreased
vasculature may also be involved in the drug treatment induced tumor cell death.

The efficacy of STAT3 only in early but not late stage is likely to involved factors other than
proliferation, death or change in vasculature, such as initial establishment of tumors, change
tumor cytokines, or other factors

STAT3 deficiency abrogates MPNST formation in vivo

With any chemical inhibitor, there is the potential for lack of specificity. Therefore, to
confirm the role of STAT3 in MPNST, we transduced NF1 patient-derived S462TY MPNST
cells with a lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting STAT3; a non-targeting shRNA also
expressing YFP served as a control. Western blot analysis confirmed that STAT3 level was
decreased after infection of MPNST cells with this vector, which did not change pAKT or
pERK levels, indicating that other signaling pathways remain intact in shSTAT3 treated
MPNST cells (Figure 5A). MTS assay of shSTAT3 expressing cells revealed decreased
numbers of viable cells, but in contrast to cells exposed to JAK/STAT3 inhibitors cleaved
caspase-3 was not detectable, suggesting that these cells were not dying by apoptosis (data
not shown). It is possible that target JAK as well as STAT with inhibitors cause a shift to
apoptosis. We injected sh-non-target controls or shSTAT3 cells subcutaneously into nu/nu
(nude) mice (n = 6). Tumor growth was not detectable on the right sides of animals, injected
with STAT3 shRNA-expressing MPNST cells (Figure 5B, arrowhead). However, the left

sides, which received the same number of non-target shRNA-expressing MPNST cells,
exhibited significant tumor growth (Figure 5B, arrow). Mice were sacrificed at day 64, when
volumes of control non-target tumors reached allowable limits (Figure 5C). These results
confirm a key role for STAT3 in MPNST tumor formation in xenografts.

EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 activation contributes to MPNST transformation

To determine if EGFR expression contributed to STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation in vivo,
we monitored STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation in the NPcis mouse GEM-PNST compared
to NPcis;Wa2/+ mouse GEM-PNSTs (20). pSTAT3 decreased significantly in NPcis;Wa2+;
mouse GEM-PNSTs (n=4, Figure 6A), compared to NPcis mouse GEM-PNSTs (n=4, Figure
6B, 6C, p<0.001). Western blots confirmed decreased pJAK2, total JAK2 (tJAK2) and
pSTAT3 in NPcis;Wa2/+ mouse GEM-PNST tumors compared to the NPcis GEM-PNSTs
(Figure 6D), suggesting that the decrease of pSTAT3 (Tyr 705) is attributed at least in part
JAK2, but we can not exclude the possibility that the STAT3 is directly phosphorylated and
activated by EGFR. To determine if EGFR expression correlates with STAT3 (Tyr705)
phosphorylation, we stimulated serum starved 8814 cells with EGF (20ng/mL) for 10
minutes and monitored pEGFR and pSTAT3 (Tyr705) levels. Both EGFR and STAT3
(Tyr705) were robustly phosphorylated in the EGF stimulated cells (Figure 6E). In 8814
cells treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774, pSTAT3 (Tyr705) deceased
correlated with pEGFR level (Figure 6F). These gain and loss of function of EGFR results
demonstrate that EGFR is a significant activator of STAT3 in MPNST cells.

Discussion

We found that increasing EGF receptor levels in Nf1 peripheral nerve glial cells is sufficient
to promote the transformation of benign neurofibroma to aggressive GEM-PNST, the
counterpart of human MPNST. Activated STAT3 was prominent in human MPNSTs and
mouse GEM-PNSTs, and a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor delayed the growth of MPNST in nude
mice. Furthermore, EGFR provided a major input to STAT3 activation in vitro and in vivo.
The data support the hypotheses that STAT3 is sufficient for MPNST transformation but in
spite of effects vasculature and tumor cell survival, is not necessary for tumor growth in
established MPNST.

One third of Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre CNP-hEGFR mice developed GEM-PNST. As all Schwann cell
in the CNP-hEGFR mouse nerve express EGFR (20) and all the GEM-PNST tumor cells
express hEGFR (Figure 1H), therefore we infer co-expression of Nf1 and EGFR in the target
cells. It is likely that additional events must occur in these cells to promote transformation to
GEM-PNST, accounting for the low penetrance of aggressive tumors in this model. This is
consistent with the numerous genetic changes in human MPNSTs (28). Our data support a
role for EGFR expression levels early in sarcoma formation. This is consistent with our
findings that 1) while shSTAT3 prevented xenograft formation, early treatment of tumors
delayed MPNST formation while treatment of established tumors with STAT3 inhibitor did
not. And 2) reduced EGFR activity delayed but did not prevent MPSNT growth (Ling et al.,
2005). A role for EGFR expression levels in early sarcoma formation could explain why
EGFR expression levels in resected MPNST are not prognostic (18). Our gain-of-function
data in genetically engineered mice also suggests that increased levels of EGFR might serve
as a modifier predisposing to MPNST formation. Studies searching for modifiers of Nf1
GEM-PNST identified a locus on mouse chromosome 11, close to Egfr (29-31). However,
modifier effects might also derive from increased expression of EGFR ligands or EGFR
ligand proteases, and/or increased expression of other pathway genes.

STAT3 is known to act as an oncogene, initiating tumor formation and maintaining tumor
cell proliferation in other tumor systems (21). Consistent with these studies, our data support

a key role for STAT3 in transformation of MPNST. In tissue culture, MPNST cells
remained responsive to JAK and JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors, as they do to EGFR inhibitors (1,
7), (32). Ligand-bound, phosphorylated EGFR physically interacts with the SH2 domain of
STAT3 – leading to phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, STAT3 dimerization,
translocation to the nucleus, and STAT3-activated gene transcription (33). EGFR and
phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) are co-expressed in many cancers (34-37). In human
MPNST and mouse GEM-PNSTs, STAT3 was phosphorylated at Tyr705, and STAT3
phosphorylation was robust in all MPNST tissue sections. In contrast, STAT3 was
phosphorylated at Ser727 in only a low percentage of cells, and in less than 20% of tested
human and mouse tumors. A recent in vitro study found STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser727
in an MPNST cell line (24). Thus, while Ser727 may be relevant in some rare tumors,
STAT3 (Tyr705) is more consistently phosphorylated in and relevant to MPNSTs. EGFR
signaling pathways induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition via STAT3-mediated TWIST
gene expression in breast cancer (38). Therefore, it is perhaps significant that TWIST is
frequently over-expressed in MPNST (28, 39). STAT3 is a potential therapeutic target, since
blocking it with shRNA or the non-specific inhibitor curcumin inhibits growth in several
cancer models (24, 34-37). Use of the specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, FLLL32, and/or its
derivatives, should enable future clinical testing.

In summary, EGFR promotes MPNST formation via JAK2/STAT3 activation.
Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 using FLLL32 delays MPNST growth, and
shSTAT3 eliminates MPNST formation. These data suggest that the EGFR-STAT3 axis
contributes to MPNST initiation. However, once tumors become established, they no longer
respond to EGFR or STAT3 inhibition.

Materials and methods
Animals

Cell culture

Mice were housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities on a 12-hour dark-light
cycle with free access to food and water. The animal care and use committees of Cincinnati
Children's Hospital Medical Center or University of Minnesota approved all animal
procedures. C57Bl/6 CNP-hEGFR transgenic mice (CNP-hEGFR/+) (20) were interbred to
obtain homozygous mice (CNP-hEGFR/CNP-hEGFR). Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre mice on a 129/Bl/6
mixed background (26). DhhCre mice were bred onto the Nf1fl/fl background to obtain an F1
generation (Nf1fl/+;DhhCre/+); F1 and CNP-hEGFR/CNP-hEGFR mice were bred to obtain
F2 Nf1fl/+;DhhCre/+;CNP-hEGFR+, and F2 and Nf1fl/fl mice were bred to obtain Nf1fl/fl;
DhhCre, CNP-hEGFR+. Littermates served as controls.

MPNST cell lines included T265, ST8814, S462, S462TY [derived from the S462 cell line
(40) by two rounds of in vivo growth as xenografts], and STS26T were maintained in
DMEM/10% FBS/1% penicillin/streptomycin. For drug treatment, inhibitors were added
two hours after plating of cells. MTS assays were performed at day 4 as described (39). For
EGF stimulation assays, 80% confluent of ST8814 cells were serum starved overnight, EGF
(20ng/mL) was added for 10 minutes and cells were collected for western blot analysis. For
OSI-774 inhibition assays, ST8814 cells were treated with OSI-774 (3.3μM) for 48 hours
and then collected for western blot analysis. DMSO (0.1%) was used as control. Primary
human Schwann cells were the gift of Patrick Wood Miami Project to the Paralysis, and
were cultured as described (41).

In vivo drug treatment

Page 7

We dissolved FLLL32 in 12.5% alcohol + 12.5% cremaphor by boiling for 15 minutes.
Drug was prepared fresh every other day. We administered FLLL32 ( 200mg/kg) or vehicle
(12.5% alcohol + 12.5% cremaphor) to tumor bearing nude mice daily for 2 or 7 weeks by
intraperitoneal injection in 200 – 300ul based on mouse weight. Mice were weighed twice a
week.

Immunohistochemistry and histology

Tissue was embedded in paraffin, and blocks were cut to generate 6-μm sections.
Deparaffinized sections were stained with either H&E or incubated overnight at 4°C with
antibodies: anti-S100β (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), anti-human EGFR (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY), Ki67 (Novacastra Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) or anti-pSTAT3
(Tyr705) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The next day, sections were incubated in HRP-labeled
secondary antibody and staining was detected by DAB (DAKO). For immunefluoresence
staining, sections were incubated with species specific fluorophores (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME). For the TUNEL staining, we used acidification as recommended (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN). Sections were viewed with a microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY)
equipped with a digital imaging system.

Lentiviral infection

We infected S462TY cells at 60% confluence with shSTAT3 or non-target control (Sigma).
We incubated lentiviral particles with MPNST cells in the presence of polybrene (8μg/ml;
Sigma-Aldrich) daily for 3 days, followed by selection in puromycin (2.5μg/ml; Sigma-
Aldrich). Surviving cells were collected for xenograft injection.

Mouse xenografts

We injected 2.3×106 S462TY MPNST cells in a total volume of 150 μl of 30% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) into flanks of 5- to 6-week-old female athymic nude (nu/
nu) mice (Harlan, IN); right flanks were injected with shSTAT3 cells, and left with non-
target control cells. Tumor volume was calculated as L * W2 (π/6), where L is the longest
diameter and W is the width Tumors were dissected one hour after last dose and
immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemistry or fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for histology.

Western blots

Tumor proteins were extracted using extraction buffer (20 mMNaPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 2
mMMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μM phenylasine oxide, 10 nM okadaic
acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10
μg/ml tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μg/ml N α-tosyl-L-lysine
chloromethyl ketone). Protein concentration was estimated using Coomassie® Plus Protein
Assay Reagent. Proteins (40 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membrane. Membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat milk + 0.1% TBST to minimize nonspecific binding. Antibodies recognizing
EGFR, pJAK2, JAK2, pSTAT3, STAT3, pERK, ERK, and β-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) were used. Antibody binding to the membrane was visualized using a
chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). The bands
obtained were quantified by Gel-pro analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD).
Anti-β-actin was used as a loading control. At least three different tumor lysates were
analyzed for each antigen.

Figure 5. Genetic inhibition of STAT3 prevents growth of S462TY xenograft in nude mice
(a) Western blot confirming knock down of both pSTAT3 and total STAT3 (tSTAT3) in
NF1 patient-derived S462TY MPNST cells infected with shRNA-STAT3 lentivirus; control
is non-target YFP-shRNA. A and B designated different shRNA. (b) Athymic nude mice
were injected subcutaneously with shRNA STAT3 (shRNA A)-expressing S462TY MPNST
cells in one flank (arrow head), and non-target shRNA-expressing cells in the other flank
(arrow). Tumor size was photographed at day 64. Tumor growth was only detectable on the
control side (arrow). (c) Tumor volume was measured twice weekly, and mice sacrificed at
day 64. Tumor volume calculations demonstrate that shSTAT3 blocks growth of MPNST
S462TY xenografts (n=6) compared to non-target (n=6) (p<0.01).
