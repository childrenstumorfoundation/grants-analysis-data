Glioblastoma is one of the most challenging forms of cancer to treat. Here we describe a computational platform that integrates 
the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. 
We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations 
and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. 
Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells 
along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR 
to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions 
activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the 
pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary intrinsic malignant 
brain tumor, affecting ~10,000 new patients each year with a median sur-
vival rate of 12–15 months1,2. Identifying and understanding the functional 
importance of genetic alterations that drive the initiation and progression 
of GBM is crucial to develop effective therapies. Previous efforts in GBM 
genome characterization have identified somatic changes in well-known 
GBM genes (EGFR, PTEN, IDH1, TP53 and NF1, among others) and nom-
inated putative cancer genes with somatic mutations, but the functional 
consequences of most of these alterations are unknown3–6. Furthermore, 
the abundance of passenger mutations and large regions of copy-number 
variations (CNVs) complicates the definition of the landscape of driver 
mutations in GBM. To address this challenge, we used a new statistical 
approach to nominate driver genes in GBM by integrating somatic muta-
tions identified by whole-exome sequencing with a CNV analysis that 
prioritizes the focality and magnitude of the genetic alterations.

Recurrent and oncogenic gene fusions are hallmarks of hematologi-
cal malignancies and have also been uncovered in solid tumors7,8. We 
recently reported that a small subset of GBMs harbor FGFR-TACC gene 
fusions and provided data to suggest that individuals with FGFR-TACC–
positive tumors would benefit from targeted FGFR kinase inhibition9. It 
remains unknown whether gene fusions involving other receptor tyro-
sine kinase (RTK)-coding genes exist and produce oncogene addiction 
in GBM. Here we analyze a large RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data set of 
primary GBMs and glioma sphere cultures (GSCs) and report the global 
landscape of in-frame gene fusions in human GBM.

Nomination of candidate GBM genes
We reasoned that integration of somatic point mutations and focal 
CNVs would uncover candidate driver GBM genes. MutComFocal is

that were previously unreported in GBM. On 
the basis of their role in central nervous sys-
tem development and homeostasis as well as 
their potential function in gliomagenesis, we 
selected 24 genes for resequencing in an inde-
pendent  data  set  of  83  GBMs  and  matched 
normal controls. Using Sanger sequencing, we 
found 18 genes that were somatically mutated 
in  the  independent  panel  (labeled  in  red  in  
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 5). Each vali-
dated new GBM gene is targeted by somatic 
mutations and CNVs in a cumulative fraction 
comprising  between  2.9%  and  45.7%  of  the 
GBMs (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, 
mutations  of  the  18  new  GBM  genes  occur 
mostly in tumors with global mutation rates 
that are similar to the mean rate of 43 muta-
tions per tumor and are well within the 95% 
confidence interval, indicating that mutations 
of the 18 new genes do not cluster in hypermu-
tated tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Among the commonly mutated and focally 
deleted genes with the top MutComFocal scores 
that  we  validated  in  the  independent  GBM 
data set, we found BCOR, LRP family mem-
bers, HERC2, LZTR1 and CTNND2. BCOR, 
an X-linked gene, encodes a component of the 
nuclear co-repressor complex that is essential 
for normal development of the neuroectoderm 
and  normal  stem  cell  functions11–13.  BCOR 
mutations have recently been described in reti-
noblastoma and medulloblastoma14,15. LRP1B, 
encoding a member of the LDL receptor family, is among the most fre-
quently mutated genes in human cancer (Fig. 1c)16. Notably, two other 
LDL receptor family members (LRP2 and LRP1) are mutated in 4.4% 
and 2.9% of tumors, respectively (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1).  
The LRP proteins are highly expressed in the neuroepithelium and are 
essential for forebrain morphogenesis in mice and humans17,18. The 
tumor-suppressor function of LRP proteins in GBM may relate to their 
ability to promote chemosensitivity and control of the Sonic hedgehog 
signaling pathway, which has been implicated in cancer-initiating cells 
in GBM19–21. Localized on chromosome 15q13, the HECT ubiquitin 
ligase gene HERC2 is deleted and mutated in 15.1% and 2.2% of GBMs, 
respectively (Supplementary Table 4). HERC2 has been implicated in 
severe neurodevelopmental syndromes, and HERC2 substrates regulate 
genome stability and DNA damage repair22,23.

LZTR1 mutations drive self renewal of glioma spheres
LZTR1 received one of the highest Del-Mut scores by MutComFocal 
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 4). The LZTR1 coding region had 
nonsynonymous mutations in 4.4% of GBMs, and the LZTR1 locus 
(chromosome 22q11) was deleted in 22.4% of GBMs. Among the 18 new 
GBM genes, LZTR1 had the highest co-occurrence score of mutations 
and deletions (P = 0.0007, Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary Table 6). 
It also scored at the top of the list of genes whose CNVs were statisti-
cally correlated with expression (the Pearson correlation between LZTR1 
CNVs and expression was 0.36, P < 10–6 by Student’s t distribution; 
Supplementary Table 7). In addition, LZTR1 emerged as the gene with 
the highest correlation for monoallelic expression of mutant alleles in 
tumors harboring LZTR1 deletions (P = 0.0007; Supplementary Table 8).  
Taken  together,  these  findings  indicate  that  LZTR1  is  concurrently  

an algorithm that is designed to rank genes by an integrated recurrence, 
focality and mutation score (Online Methods). We applied this strategy 
to samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 139 GBMs and 
matched normal DNA analyzed by whole-exome sequencing to identify 
somatic mutations and 469 GBMs analyzed by the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 
platform to identify CNVs.

The  whole-exome  analysis  identified  a  mean  of  43  nonsynony-
mous somatic mutations per tumor sample (Supplementary Tables 1 
and 2). The distribution of substitutions shows a higher rate of tran-
sitions as compared to transversions (67%), with a strong preference 
for C>T and G>A transitions (55%) (Supplementary Fig. 1). As has 
been seen in other tumor types10, 19.2% of the mutations occurred in 
a CpG dinucleotide context (Supplementary Fig. 2). Among somatic 
small nucleotide variants, the most frequently mutated genes have well-
established roles in cancer, including GBM (TP53, EGFR, PTEN and 
IDH1; Supplementary Table 3). In addition to known cancer genes, 
potentially new candidate driver genes were mutated in ~5% of the 
tumor samples. By integrating mutational and common focal genomic 
lesions, MutComFocal (Supplementary Table 4) stratified somatically 
mutated genes into three groups: recurrently mutated genes without 
copy-number alterations (Mut), genes in regions of focal and recurrent 
amplifications (Amp-Mut) and genes in regions of focal and recurrent 
deletions (Del-Mut). We generated a list of 67 genes that scored at the 
top of each of the three categories and included nearly all the genes 
that have been previously implicated in GBM (Supplementary Table 4).  
Among these genes (labeled in blue in Fig. 1) are IDH1 (Mut; Fig. 1a),  
PIK3C2B,  MDM4,  MYCN,  PIK3CA,  PDGFRA,  KIT,  EGFR,  BRAF 
(Amp-Mut; Fig. 1b) PIK3R1, PTEN, RB1, TP53, NF1 and ATRX (Del-
Mut; Fig. 1c). The analysis also selected 52 new candidate driver genes

perturb  the  interaction  with  CUL3,  we  prepared  in  vitro–translated 
wild-type, p.Glu353*, p.Trp437* and p.Arg810Trp MYC-tagged LZTR1 
proteins and tested their ability to bind to Flag-CUL3 purified from mam-
malian cells. Wild-type LZTR1 bound Flag-CUL3, but the p.Glu353* and 
p.Trp437* mutants lost this property. However, the p.Arg810Trp mutant 
retained CUL3 binding in this assay (Fig. 2c). Besides promoting the 
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of substrates, cullin adaptors are short-
lived proteins that undergo autoubiquitylation and destruction by the same 
cullin complexes that direct substrate ubiquitylation32–34. Thus, impaired 
ubiquitin ligase activity of the LZTR1-CUL3 complex should result in the 
accumulation of mutant LZTR1 proteins. Each of the three LZTR1 mutants

targeted in GBM by mutations and copy number loss, fulfilling the two-
hit model for tumor-suppressor inactivation in cancer.

LZTR1 codes for a protein with a characteristic kelch-BTB-BACK-
BTB-BACK domain architecture (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) and is 
expressed in normal brain (Supplementary Table 9). LZTR1 is highly 
conserved in metazoans. Although it was initially proposed that LZTR1 
functions as a transcriptional regulator, this role was not confirmed in 
follow-up studies24. Most proteins with BTB-BACK domains are sub-
strate adaptors in cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complexes, in which 
the BTB-BACK region binds to the N-terminal domain of CUL3 and 
a ligand-binding domain, often a kelch six-bladed b-propeller motif, 
binds to substrates that have been targeted for 
ubiquitylation25. To determine whether LZTR1 
directly binds CUL3, we performed coimmu-
noprecipitation experiments in human glioma 
cells.  We  found  that  CUL3  immunoprecipi-
tates contain LZTR1 (Fig. 2a), suggesting that 
LZTR1 is an adaptor in CUL3 ubiquitin ligase 
complexes.

To address the function of LZTR1 mutants, 
we  built  a  homology  model  of  LZTR1  based 
partly on the crystal structures of the MATH-
BTB-BACK protein SPOP26, the BTB-BACK-
kelch  proteins  KLHL3  (ref.  27)  and  KLHL11 
(ref.  28)  and  the  kelch  domain  of  KEAP1  
(ref. 29) (Fig. 2b). We predict that the second 
BTB-BACK  region  of  LZTR1  binds  CUL3 
because of a f-X-E motif in this BTB domain, fol-
lowed by a 3-Box/BACK region (Supplementary 
Fig. 5a)26. However, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility  that  the  preceding  BTB-BACK  region 
also participates in CUL3 binding. Five of seven 
LZTR1  mutations  that  we  identified  in  GBM 
are located within the kelch domain and tar-
get highly conserved amino acids (Fig. 2b and 
Supplementary  Figs.  4  and  5b).  Notably,  the 
concentration of LZTR1 mutations in the kelch 
domain reflects a similar pattern of mutations 
in  the  kelch-coding  region  of  KLHL3,  which 
was recently identified in families with hyper-
tension and electrolytic abnormalities30,31. The 
p.Arg198Gly and p.Gly248Arg alterations local-
ize to the b-c loop of the kelch domain in a region 
that is predicted to provide the substrate-binding 
surface29. The p.Trp105Arg alteration targets a 
highly conserved anchor residue in the kelch 
repeats, and the p.Thr288Ile alteration disrupts 
a buried residue that is conserved in LZTR1 (Fig. 
2b and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5b). Both 
alterations are expected to perturb the folding 
of  the  kelch  domain.  The  p.Glu353*  altera-
tion is expected to produce a misfolded kelch 
domain, in addition to removing the C-terminal 
BTB-BACK regions. Located in the BTB-BACK 
domains, the remaining two alterations either 
truncate  the  entire  BTB-BACK-BTB-BACK 
region (p.Trp437*) or are predicted to disrupt 
the folding of the last helical hairpin in the BTB-
BACK domain (p.Arg810Trp; Fig. 2b).

are predicted to affect the BTB-BACK domains

assays (Fig. 2d). The steady state and half-life of the LZTR1 p.Arg810Trp

GBMs harboring mutations and deletions of LZTR1 or normal LZTR1 
showed that tumors with genetic inactivation of LZTR1 were enriched 
for  genes  associated  with  glioma  sphere  growth  and  proliferation35  
(Fig. 3a). Introduction of LZTR1 into three independent GBM-derived 
sphere cultures resulted in strong inhibition of glioma sphere formation 
and the expression of glioma stem cell markers (Fig. 3b–e). LZTR1 also 
decreased the size of the tumor spheres, induced a flat and adherent 
phenotype and reduced the abundance of proteins associated with cell-
cycle progression (cyclin A, PLK1 and p107; 
Fig. 3d,e). Notably, both the p.Arg810Trp and 
p.Trp437* alterations abolished the ability of 
LZTR1  to  impair  glioma  sphere  formation  
(Fig.  3f).  These  experiments  indicate  that 
LZTR1 inactivation in human GBM drives the 
self renewal and growth of glioma spheres.

expressed at the highest levels in normal brain 
(Supplementary Table 9). CTNND2 encodes 
d-catenin, a member of the p120 subfamily of 
catenins that are expressed almost exclusively 
in the nervous system, where d-catenin is cru-
cial for neurite elongation, dendritic morpho-
genesis and synaptic plasticity36–38. Germline 
hemizygous loss of CTNND2 impairs cogni-
tive  functions  and  underlies  some  forms  of 
intellectual disability39,40. CTNND2 shows a 
pronounced clustering of mutations in GBM. 
The observed spectrum of mutations includes 
four in the armadillo-coding domain and one 
in the region coding for the N-terminal coiled-
coil domain (Supplementary Fig. 6a), which 
are the two most relevant functional domains 
of d-catenin. Each mutation targets highly con-
served residues with probably (p.Lys629Gln, 
p.Ala776Thr, p.Ser881Leu and p.Asp999Glu) 
and possibly (p.Ala71Thr) damaging conse-
quences41. GBMs harbor focal genomic losses 
of CTNND2, and deletions correlate with loss of 
CTNND2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 6b  
and Supplementary Table 7).

Immunostaining experiments showed that 
d-catenin is strongly expressed in the normal 
brain, particularly in neurons, as demonstrated 
by  co-staining  with  the  neuronal  markers 
b3-tubulin and MAP2 but not the astrocytic 
marker GFAP (Fig. 4a,b). Conversely, immu-
nostaining of 69 GBMs and protein blotting 
of  nine  GSCs  showed  negligible  or  absent 
expression of d-catenin in 21 tumors and in 
most of the GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). 
Oncogenic transformation in the central ner-
vous  system  frequently  disrupts  the  default

is strongly enriched in tumors showing the mesenchymal gene expres-
sion signature (P = 2.4 × 10–12, t test; Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tumors 
with reduced CTNND2 expression were characterized by poor clini-
cal outcome, among which tumors with CTNND2 copy number loss 
showed the worst prognosis (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). Tumors with 
low CTNND2 expression showed the worst clinical outcome in mes-
enchymal GBM, although nonmesenchymal tumors also showed poor 
prognosis,  albeit  with  reduced  strength  (Supplementary  Fig.  7d). 
Mesenchymal transformation of GBM is associated with irreversible 
loss of proneural cell fate and neuronal markers42 and is detected in most 
established glioma cell lines. Expression of d-catenin in the U87 human 
glioma cell line reduced cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 8a),  
elevated the expression of the neuronal proteins bIII-tubulin, PSD95 (a 
postsynaptic marker) and N-cadherin (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 
8b) and decreased mRNA and protein levels of mesenchymal markers 
(Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Fig. 8b). These effects were associated 
with morphologic changes that were characterized by neurite exten-
sion and the development of branched dendritic processes (Fig. 4c and 
Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). Conversely, expression of the p.Ala776Thr, 
p.Lys629Gln and p.Asp999Glu mutants of CTNND2 did not induce neu-
ronal features or downregulate the mesenchymal marker fibronectin (Fig. 
4e and Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). Consistent with d-catenin inhibition 
of cell proliferation in glioma cells, only wild-type d-catenin decreased 
the expression of cyclin A, an S-phase cyclin (Fig. 4e). Next we analyzed 
the effect of expressing d-catenin in GBM-derived sphere culture #48, 
which lacks endogenous d-catenin protein (Supplementary Fig. 6d)

sphere culture #48 strongly reduced the abun-
dance of the mesenchymal proteins smooth 
muscle actin (SMA), collagen-5A1 (COL5A1) 
and  fibronectin,  as  measured  by  quantita-
tive immunofluorescence (Fig. 5a,b). It also 
induced  bIII-tubulin  more  than  eightfold  
(Fig. 5c,d). A time-course analysis showed that the highest degree of 
bIII-tubulin–positive neurite extension was present at 4–6 d after trans-
duction, which was then followed by progressive depletion of neuronal-
like cells from culture (Fig. 5d). We then asked whether d-catenin affects 
the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres in vitro or their ability 
to grow as tumor masses in vivo. In a limiting dilution assay, d-catenin 
inhibited glioma sphere formation more than eightfold (Fig. 5e). To 
determine the effect of d-catenin on brain tumorigenesis in vivo, we gen-
erated #48 GSCs expressing luciferase and conducted bioluminescence 
imaging at different times after stereotactic transduction of control and 
d-catenin–expressing cells in mouse brains. When compared to controls, 
we observed a fivefold inhibition of tumor growth by d-catenin at each 
time point analyzed (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 8e). These results 
identify CTNND2 inactivation as a key genetic alteration driving the 
aggressive mesenchymal phenotype of GBM.

Recurrent EGFR fusions in GBM
To identify gene fusions in GBM, we analyzed RNA-seq data from a 
total of 185 GBM samples (161 primary GBMs from TCGA plus 24 
short-term GSCs freshly isolated in our laboratory from individuals 
carrying primary GBMs). The analysis of the RNA-seq data led to the 
discovery of 92 candidate rearrangements that give rise to in-frame 
fusion transcripts (Supplementary Table 10). Besides the previously 
reported FGFR3-TACC3 fusions events, the most frequent recurrent in-
frame fusions involved EGFR, which were present in 7.6% of the samples 
(14/185, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8–11.3%). Nine of 14 EGFR

fusions included the recurrent partner SEPT14 (6/185, 3.2%) or PSPH 
(3/185, 1.6%) as the 3´ gene segment in the fusion. All EGFR-SEPT14 and 
two of three EGFR-PSPH gene fusions occurred within amplified regions 
of the fusion genes (Supplementary Fig. 9). The quantitative analysis 
of expressed reads spanning the fusion breakpoint compared to reads 
spanning EGFR exons not implicated in the fusion transcripts showed 
that the EGFR fusion genes were expressed at higher levels in five of nine 
tumors (Supplementary Table 11). We also found two highly expressed 
in-frame fusions involving NTRK1, the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase 
receptor 1 gene, as the 3´ gene with two different 5´ partners (NFASC-
NTRK1 and BCAN-NTRK1). Fusions involving NTRK1 are common in 
papillary thyroid carcinomas44. Using EXomeFuse, an algorithm that 
reconstructs genomic fusions from whole-exome data, we confirmed 
that the EGFR-SEPT14 and NTRK1 fusions result from recurrent chro-
mosomal translocations and reconstructed the corresponding genomic 
breakpoints (Supplementary Table 12).

The sequence of the PCR products spanning the fusion breakpoint 
validated all three types of recurrent in-frame fusion predictions (EGFR-
SEPT14, EGFR-PSPH and NTRK1 fusions; Fig. 6 and Supplementary 
Figs. 10 and 11). In Figure 6a,b, we show the prediction and cDNA 
sequence validation, respectively, for one tumor harboring an EGFR-
SEPT14 fusion (TCGA-27-1837). The amplified cDNA contained an 
ORF for a 1,041-residue that resulted from the fusion of EGFR residues 
1–982 with SEPT14 residues 373–432 (Fig. 6c). Thus, the structure of 
EGFR-SEPT14 fusions involve EGFR at the N terminus, providing a 
receptor tyrosine kinase domain that is fused to a coiled-coil domain 
from SEPT14. Exon-specific RNA-seq expression in TCGA-27-1837 
demonstrated that the EGFR and SEPT14 exons that are implicated in 
the fusion are highly expressed as compared to mRNA sequences that 
are not included in the fusion event (Supplementary Fig. 12). Using 
PCR, we mapped the genomic breakpoint to chromosome 7 (55,268,937 

for EGFR and 55,870,909 for SEPT14, genome build GRCh37/hg19) 
within  EGFR  exon  25  and  SEPT14  intron  9,  creating  a  transcript 
in  which  the  5´  EGFR  exon  24  is  spliced  to  the  3´  SEPT14  exon  10  
(Fig. 6d). Notably, the fused EGFR-PSPH cDNA and predicted fusion 
protein in sample TCGA-06-5408 involved the same EGFR N-terminal 
region that was implicated in EGFR-SEPT14, with PSPH providing a 
35-residue C-terminal portion (Supplementary Fig. 10). An example of 
a fusion in which the EGFR-TK region is the 3´ partner is the CAND1-
EGFR fusion in GSC #16 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Each fusion tran-
script includes the region of the EGFR mRNA coding for the TK domain 
(Supplementary  Table  10).  RT-PCR  and  genomic  PCR  followed  by 
Sanger sequencing of GBM TCGA-06-5411 validated the NFASC-NTRK1 
fusion in which the predicted fusion protein includes the TK domain 
of the high-affinity NGF receptor (TRKA, also called NTRK1) fused 
downstream to the immunoglobulin-like region of the cell-adhesion 
and ankyrin-binding region of neurofascin (Supplementary Fig. 11).

To confirm that GBM harbors recurrent EGFR fusions and to deter-
mine their frequency in an independent data set, we screened cDNA 
from a panel of 248 GBMs and discovered ten additional cases with 
EGFR-SEPT14 fusions (4%). Conversely, we did not find NFASC-NTRK1 
fusions in this data set. We also determined the frequency of EGFR-
PSPH fusions to be 2.2% (3/135).

The discovery of recurrent EGFR fusions in GBM is of particular 
interest. EGFR is activated in a fraction of primary GBMs (~25%) by an 
in-frame deletion of exons 2–7 (EGFRvIII)45. However, seven of nine 
tumors harboring EGFR-SEPT14 and EGFR-PSPH gene fusions lacked 
the EGFRvIII rearrangement (Supplementary Table 13). We sought to 
determine whether the most frequent EGFR fusion in GBM (EGFR-
SEPT14) provides an alternative mechanism of EGFR activation and con-
fers sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. First we asked whether EGFR gene 
fusions cluster into any gene expression subtype of GBM (proneural,

neural,  classical  or  mesenchymal).  Although  no  individual  subtype 
showed a statistically significant enrichment of EGFR fusions, eight of 
nine GBMs harboring EGFR-SEPT14 or EGFR-PSPH belonged to the 
classical and mesenchymal subtype (Fisher’s P = 0.05 for classical or mes-
enchymal enrichment; Supplementary Table 14). Next we compared 
the effects of ectopic EGFR-SEPT14, EGFRvIII or wild-type EGFR on 
glioma cells. Lentiviral transduction of human GSC #48 (which lacks 
genomic alteration of EGFR) showed that cells expressing EGFR-SEPT14 
or EGFRvIII but not those expressing wild-type EGFR or an empty vec-
tor retained growth and self renewal in the absence of EGF and basic 
FGF (bFGF) (Fig. 7a). Accordingly, established glioma cell lines express-
ing EGFR-SEPT14 or EGFRvIII proliferated at a higher rate than control 
cells or cells expressing wild-type EGFR (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). 
Furthermore, EGFR-SEPT14 and EGFRvIII markedly enhanced the 
migration of glioma cells in a wound assay (Supplementary Fig. 14c). 
These findings suggest that EGFR-SEPT14 might constitutively activate 
signaling events downstream of EGFR. When analyzed in the presence 
or absence of mitogens, the expression of EGFR-SEPT14 (or EGFRvIII) 
in GSC #48 triggered constitutive activation of phosphorylated STAT3 
(pSTAT3) but had no effects on pERK or pAKT (Fig. 7b,c). Differential 
gene expression analysis identified a set of nine genes upregulated in 
EGFR-SEPT14–positive  tumors  compared  with  EGFRvIII-positive 
GBMs  (Supplementary  Fig.  15).  These  genes  broadly  relate  to  the 
inflammatory and immune response, and some code for chemokines 
that have been associated with aggressive glioma phenotypes (CXCL9, 
CXCL10 and CXCL11)46.

We then sought to investigate whether EGFR-SEPT14 fusions confer 
sensitivity to inhibition of EGFR-TK. Treatment of GSC #48 express-
ing EGFR-SEPT14, EGFRvIII, wild-type EGFR or vector control with 
lapatinib, an irreversible EGFR inhibitor that was recently proposed 
to target EGFR alterations in GBM47, showed that EGFR-SEPT14 and 
EGFRvIII but not wild-type EGFR sensitized glioma cells to pharma-
ceutical EGFR inhibition (Fig. 7d). We obtained similar effects after 
treatment of derivatives of GSC #48 with erlotinib, another inhibitor 
of EGFR-TK (Fig. 7e). To determine whether sensitivity to EGFR-TK 

inhibition is retained in human glioma cells naturally harboring EGFR-
SEPT14 in vivo, we used an EGFR-SEPT14–positive GBM xenograft 
(D08-0537 MG) that was established from a heavily pretreated patient. 
Treatment of D08-0537 MG tumors with lapatinib or erlotinib showed 
that both drugs significantly (P = 0.003 for lapatinib, P = 0.037 for 
erlotinib) delayed tumor growth, with lapatinib showing the strongest 
antitumor effects. Conversely, EGFR inhibitors were ineffective against 
GBM xenograft D08-0714 MG, which lacks EGFR genomic alterations 
(Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 14d). Taken together, these data show 
that EGFR-SEPT14 fusions confer mitogen-independent growth, consti-
tutively activate STAT3 signaling and impart sensitivity to EGFR kinase 
inhibition to glioma cells harboring the fusion gene.

DISCUSSION
We describe a computational pipeline that computes the frequency, mag-
nitude and focality of CNVs at any locus in the human genome with 
the somatic mutation rate for genes residing at that genomic location, 
thus integrating two genetic hallmarks of driver cancer genes (focality 
of CNVs and point mutations) into a single score. Besides recognizing 
nearly all genes that are known to have functional relevance in GBM, we 
discovered and validated somatic mutations in 18 new genes that also 
harbor focal and recurrent CNVs in a fraction of GBMs. The importance 
of some of these genes extends beyond GBM, as is underscored by cross-
tumor relevance (for example, BCOR) and protein family recurrence 
(for example, LRP family members). Also, the LZTR1 mutations that 
target highly conserved residues in the kelch domain (Trp105, Gly248 
and Thr288) and in the second BTB-BACK domain (Arg810) are recur-
rent events in other tumor types48. Thus, understanding the nature of 
the substrates of LZTR1-CUL3 ubiquitin ligase activity will provide 
important insights into the pathogenesis of multiple cancer types. The 
importance of LZTR1 genetic alterations in GBM is underscored by 
concurrent targeting of LZTR1 by mutations and deletions, supporting 
a two-hit mechanism of tumor-suppressor gene inactivation, as well as 
the impact of mutations targeting the BTB-BACK domains on CUL3 
binding and/or protein stability and their ability to release glioma cells

Figure 7  Functional analysis of the EGFR-
SEPT14 fusion and the effect of inhibition of 
EGFR kinase on glioma growth. (a) Sphere-
forming assay in the absence of EGF in GBM-
derived primary cells (GSC #48) expressing 
vector, wild-type EGFR, EGFRvIII or the EGFR-
SEPT14 fusion. The data are shown as the 
mean ± s.d. of triplicate samples (*P = 0.0051 
and *P = 0.027 for cells expressing the EGFR-
SEPT14 fusion or EGFRvIII compared with those 
expressing vector, respectively, t test). NS, not 
significant. (b) Protein blot analysis of GBM-
derived primary cells (GSC #48) expressing 
vector, EGFRvIII or the EGFR-SEPT14 fusion 
cultured in the presence of EGF. ERK1/2, ERK1 
and ERK2. (c) GBM-derived cells (GSC #48) 
expressing vector, EGFRvIII or the EGFR-SEPT14 
fusion were cultured in the absence of EGF for 
48 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF 
for the indicated times. Cells were assayed 
by protein blot analysis using the indicated 
antibodies. (d) Survival of GBM-derived cells 
(GSC #48) expressing vector, wild-type EGFR, 
EGFRvIII or the EGFR-SEPT14 fusion after 
treatment with lapatinib for 48 h at the indicated 
concentrations. The data are shown as the mean 
± s.d. of triplicate samples. (e) Survival of GBM-
derived cells (GSC #48) expressing vector, wild-type EGFR, EGFRvIII or the EGFR-SEPT14 fusion after treatment with erlotinib for 48 h at the indicated 
concentrations. The data are shown as the mean ± s.d. of triplicate samples. The experiments were repeated three times. (f) In vivo inhibition of tumor growth 
by EGFR kinase inhibitors in xenografts derived from patients with gliomas carrying the EGFR-SEPT14 fusion (n = 10) but not wild-type EGFR (n = 8). T-C

from the restraining activity of the wild-type protein on growth and 
self renewal.

The finding that loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 cluster in 
mesenchymal GBM provides a clue to the genetic events driving this 
aggressive GBM subtype. The function of d-catenin for crucial neuronal 
morphogenesis indicates that full-blown mesenchymal transformation 
in the brain requires loss of master regulators that constrain cell determi-
nation along the neuronal lineage. Introduction of d-catenin into human 
glioma spheres collapsed the mesenchymal phenotype and inhibited 
sphere formation and tumor growth. Thus, the ability of d-catenin to 
reprogram glioma cells expressing mesenchymal genes toward a neu-
ronal fate unravels an unexpected plasticity of mesenchymal GBM that 
might be exploited therapeutically.

In this study we also report the landscape of gene fusions from a large 
data set of GBMs analyzed by RNA-seq. In-frame gene fusions retain-
ing the RTK-coding domain of EGFR emerged as the most frequent 
gene fusion in GBM. In this tumor, EGFR is frequently targeted by focal 
amplifications, and our finding underscores the strong recombinogenic 
probability of focally amplified genes, as was recently reported for the 
MYC locus in medulloblastoma49. Resembling intragenic rearrangements 
that generate the EGFRvIII allele, we found that EGFR-SEPT14 fusions 
impart to glioma cells the ability to self renew and grow in the absence of 
mitogens, constitutively activate STAT3 signaling and confer sensitivity 
to EGFR inhibition. These findings highlight the relevance of fusions 
implicating RTK-coding genes in the pathogenesis of GBM9. They also 
provide a strong rationale for the inclusion of patients with GBM who 
harbor EGFR fusions in clinical trials based on EGFR inhibitors.

SAVI (statistical algorithm for variant frequency identification). We estimated 
the frequencies of variant alleles in 139 paired tumor and normal whole-exome 
samples from TCGA using the SAVI pipeline50. The algorithm estimates the 
frequency of variant alleles by constructing an empirical Bayesian prior for those 
frequencies, using data from the whole sample, and obtains a posterior distri-
bution and high credibility intervals for each allele50. The prior and posterior 
are distributed over a discrete set of frequencies with a precision of 1% and are 
connected by a modified binomial likelihood, which allows for some error rate. 
More precisely, we assume a prior distribution p(f) of the frequency f and a prior 
for the error e uniform on the interval [0,E] for a fixed 0 ≤ E ≤ 1. We think of the 
sequencing data at a particular allele as a random experiment producing a string 
of m (the total depth at the allele) bits with n ‘1’s (the variant depth at the allele). 
Assuming a binomial likelihood of the data and allowing for bits being misread 
because of random errors, the posterior probability P(f) of the frequency f is

P(f) = 

p(f)  
C

× 1
b – a

ſ

xn(1 – x)m–n dx

where C is a normalization constant. For a particular allele, the value of E is deter-
mined by the quality of the nucleotides sequenced at that position as specified 
by their Phred scores. The SAVI pipeline takes as input the reads produced by 
the sequencing technology, filters out low-quality reads and maps the rest onto a 
human reference genome. After mapping, a Bayesian prior for the distribution of 
allele frequencies for each sample is constructed by an iterative posterior update 
procedure starting with a uniform prior. To genotype the sample, we use the 
posterior high-credibility intervals for the frequency of the alleles at each genomic 
location. Alternatively, combining the Bayesian priors from different samples, we 
obtain posterior high-credibility intervals for the difference between the samples 
of the frequencies of each allele. Finally, the statistically significant differences 
between the tumor and normal samples are reported as somatic variants. The 
results are shown in Supplementary Table 1. To estimate the positive prediction 
value of SAVI in the TCGA GBM samples, we selected 41 mutations for inde-
pendent validation by Sanger sequencing. We confirmed 39 of the 41 mutations 
using Sanger sequencing, resulting in a 0.95 (95% CI 0.83–0.99) validation rate 
(Supplementary Table 2).

Supplementary Table 3 shows the candidate genes ranked by the number of 
somatic nonsynonymous mutations. A robust fit of the ratio of nonsynonymous 
to synonymous mutations was generated with a bisquare weighting function. The 
excess of nonsynonymous alterations was estimated using a Poisson distribution 
with a mean equal to the product of the ratio from the robust fit and the number 
of synonymous mutations. Genes in highly polymorphic genomic regions were 
filtered out based on an independent cohort of normal samples. The list of these 
regions includes families of genes known to generate false positives in somatic 
predictions (for example, the HLA, KRT and OR gene families).

MutComFocal. Key cancer genes are often amplified or deleted in chromosomal 
regions containing many other genes. Point mutations and gene fusions, con-
versely, provide more specific information about which genes may be implicated 
in the oncogenic process. We developed MutComFocal, a Bayesian approach that 
assigns a driver score to each gene by integrating point mutations and CNV data 
from 469 GBMs (Affymetrix SNP6.0). In general, MutComFocal uses three differ-
ent strategies. First, the focality component of the score is inversely proportional 
to the size of the genomic lesion to which a gene belongs and thus prioritizes more 
focal genomic lesions. Second, the recurrence component of the MutComFocal 
score is inversely proportional to the total number of genes altered in a sample, 
which prioritizes samples with a smaller number of altered genes. Third, the 
mutation component of the score is inversely proportional to the total number 
of genes mutated in a sample, which achieves the twofold goal of prioritizing 
mutated genes on one hand and prioritizing samples with a smaller number of 
mutations on the other.
More specifically, for a particular sample, let (c1,N1),...,(ck,Nk) describe the 
amplification lesions in that sample so that Ni is the number of genes in the 
ith lesion and ci is its copy number change from normal. For a gene belong-
ing to the ith lesion, the amplification recurrence sample score is defined as 
(c1,N1),...,(ck,Nk),  and  its  amplification  focality  sample  score  is  defined  as 

(c i/Σ jc j) × ( 1/Ni) .  To  obtain  the  amplification  recurrence  and  focality 
scores for a particular gene, we sum the corresponding sample scores over all 
the samples and normalize the result so that each score sums to 1. The deletion 
and recurrence scores are defined in a similar manner. The mutation score is 
analogous to a recurrence score in which we assume that mutated genes belong 
to lesions with only one gene.

The amplification/mutation score is defined as the product of the two ampli-
fication scores and the mutation score, whereas the deletion/mutation score is 
defined as the product of the two deletion scores and the mutation score. The 
amplification/mutation and deletion/mutation scores are normalized to 1, and 
for each score, genes are divided into tiers iteratively so that the top 2X remaining 
genes are included in the next tier, where H is the entropy of the scores of the 
remaining genes normalized to 1. On the basis of their tier across the different 
types of scores, genes are assigned to being either deleted/mutated or amplified/
mutated, and genes in the top tiers are grouped into contiguous regions. The top 
genes in each region are considered manually and selected for further functional 
validation.

The recurrence and focality scores can be interpreted as the posterior prob-
abilities that a gene is driving the selection of the disease under two different 
priors, one global and one local in nature. The recurrence score is higher if a gene 
participates in many samples that do not have too many altered genes, whereas 
the focality score is higher if the gene participates in many focal lesions. Besides 
lending strong support to the inference of a gene as a potential driver, the direc-
tionality of the copy number alteration (amplification or deletion) informs us of 
the probable behavior of the candidate gene as an oncogene or tumor suppressor, 
respectively.

The genes displayed in Figure 1 were selected on the basis of the MutComFocal 
ranking (top 250 genes), the size of the minimal region (less than 10 genes) and 
the frequency of mutations (more than 2% for deletion/mutations and at least 
1% for amplification/mutations).

RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis. We analyzed 161 RNA-seq GBM tumor sam-
ples from TCGA, a public repository containing large-scale genome sequencing 
of different cancers, plus 24 patient-derived GSCs. Nine GSC samples reported 
in previous studies were kept in our analysis to evaluate recurrence9. We analyzed 
the samples using the ChimeraScan51 algorithm to detect a list of gene fusion 
candidates. Briefly, ChimeraScan detects those reads that discordantly align to 
different transcripts of the same reference (split inserts). These reads provide an 
initial set of putative fusion candidates. The algorithm then realigns the initially 
unmapped reads to the putative fusion candidates and detects those reads that 
align across the junction boundary (split reads). These reads provide the genomic 
coordinates of the breakpoint.

RNA-seq analysis detected a total of 39,329 putative gene fusion events. To 
focus the experimental analysis on biologically relevant fused transcripts, we 
applied the Pegasus annotation pipeline (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pegasus-
fus/). For each putative fusion, Pegasus reconstructs the entire fusion sequence 
on the basis of the genomic fusion breakpoint coordinates and gene annotations. 
Pegasus also annotates the reading frame of the resulting fusion sequences as 
either in frame or a frame shift. Moreover, Pegasus detects the protein domains 
that are either conserved or lost in the new chimeric event by predicting the 
amino acid sequence and automatically querying the UniProt web service. On 
the basis of the Pegasus annotation report, we selected relevant gene fusions for 
further experimental validation according to the reading frame and the conserved 
and lost domains. The selected list (Supplementary Table 7) was based on in-
frame events expressed by ten or more reads, with at least one read spanning the 
breaking point. To filter out candidate trans-splicing events, we focused on events 
with putative breakpoints at a distance of at least 25 kb.

Identification of genetic rearrangements using whole-exome data. Although 
whole-exome sequencing data contain low intronic coverage that reduces the 
sensitivity for fusion discovery, they are readily available through the TCGA data-
base. To characterize the genomic breakpoint of the chromosomal rearrangement, 
we therefore designed EXome-Fuse, a new gene fusion discovery pipeline that is 
designed particularly to analyze whole-exome data. For the samples harboring 
EGFR-SEPT14, EGFR-PSPH, NFASC-NTRK1 and BCAN-NTRK1 fusions in RNA, 
we applied EXome-Fuse to the corresponding whole-exome sequencing data

identification, split-read identification and virtual reference alignment. Mapping 
against the human genome reference hg18 with BWA, we first identify all split 
inserts to compile a preliminary list of fusion candidates. We prune this list of any 
false positives produced from paralogous gene pairs using the Duplicated Genes 
Database and the EnsemblCompara GeneTrees52. Pseudogenes in the candidate 
list were annotated using the list from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee 
(HGNC) database53 and were given lower priority. We also filtered out candidates 
between homologous genes, as well as those with homologous or low-complexity 
regions around the breakpoint. For the remaining fusion candidates, we probed 
for any supporting split reads and their mates using BLAST with a word size of 
16, identity cutoff of 90% and an expectation cutoff of 10–4. We then create a 
virtual reference for each fusion transcript and realign all reads to calculate a 
final tally of split inserts and split reads such that all aligning read pairs maintain 
forward-reverse directionality.

Targeted exon sequencing. All protein-coding exons for the 24 genes of interest 
were sequenced using genomic DNA extracted from frozen tumors and matched 
blood. Five-hundred nanograms of DNA from each sample were sheared to an 
average size of 150 bp in a Covaris instrument for 360 s (duty cycle, 10%; inten-
sity, 5; cycles per burst, 200). Bar-coded libraries were prepared using the Kapa 
High-Throughput Library Preparation Kit Standard (Kapa Biosystems). Libraries 
were amplified using the KAPA HiFi Library Amplification kit (Kapa Biosystems) 
(eight cycles). Libraries were quantified using Qubit Fluorimetric Quantitation 
(Invitrogen), and the quality and size was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. 
An equimolar pool of the four bar-coded libraries (300 ng each) was created, 
and 1,200 ng was input to exon capture using one reaction tube of the custom 
Nimblegen SeqCap EZ (Roche) with custom probes targeting the coding exons 
of the 38 genes. Capture by hybridization was performed according to the manu-
facturer’s protocols with the following modifications: 1 nmol of a pool of blocker 
oligonucleotides (complementary to the bar-coded adapters) was used, and post-
capture PCR amplification was done using the KAPA HiFi Library Amplification 
kit, instead of the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer Kit, in 
a 60 ml volume, as we found that the Kapa HiFi kit greatly reduced or eliminated 
the bias against GC-rich regions. The pooled capture library was quantified by 
Qubit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and sequenced in on an Illumina 
MiSeq sequencer using the 2 × 150 paired-end cycle protocol. Reads were aligned 
to the hg19 build of the human genome using BWA with duplicate removal using 
SAMtools as implemented by Illumina MiSeq Reporter. Variant detection was 
performed using GATK UnifiedGenotyper. Somatic mutations were identified 
for paired samples using SomaticSniper and filtered for frequency of less than 3% 
in normal samples and over 3% in tumor samples. Variants were annotated with 
the Charity annotator to identify protein-coding changes and cross referenced 
against known dbSNP, 1000 Genomes and COSMIC variants. Sanger sequencing 
was used to confirm each mutation from normal and tumor DNA. The complete 
list of Sanger-validated somatic mutations is reported in Supplementary Table 5.

Enrichment  of  amplified  and  deleted  genes  for  single-nucleotide  variants 
(SNVs). Although MutComFocal combines SNV and CNV data to identify genes 
driving oncogenesis, it does not explicitly determine whether amplified or deleted 
genes are enriched for SNVs within the same sample. Deletions and SNVs of a 
gene within the same sample might indicate a two-hit model of a tumor suppres-
sor. Alternatively, amplifications and gain-of-function mutations of an oncogene 
within the sample might further promote oncogenesis. For each MutComFocal 
candidate gene, we determined the number of TCGA samples with both ampli-
fication and SNVs, amplification alone, SNVs alone or neither. We calculated the 
corresponding Fisher’s P value. We performed a similar analysis for deletions.

Correlation between copy number and expression. One method of assessing the 
functional relevance of an amplified or deleted gene is to assess the effect of gene 
dosage. For each gene nominated by MutComFocal, we calculated the Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient between copy number and expression. The corresponding 
P values were computed using paired Student’s t test.

Allele-specific  expression  of  SNVs.  For  a  given  gene  nominated  by 
MutComFocal, RNA sequencing can determine whether the mutant or wild-type 
allele is expressed. Toward this end, we applied VCFtools54 to the TCGA BAM 

RNA-seq files produced by TopHat, which produces the depth of reads calling 
the reference (R) and variant (V) allele. A measure of relative expression of the 
variant allele is then V/(V + R). For each mutation, we calculated the binomial 
P value of observing more than V out of V + R reads, assuming that it is equally 
probable for a read to call the variant or reference. We then pooled the binomial 
P values of each mutation using the Stouffer’s Z-score method to calculate the 
combined P value per gene.

Ruling out passenger mutations in hypermutated samples. To rule out the pos-
sibility that MutComFocal candidates tend to be passenger mutations in hyper-
mutated samples, we compared the number of mutations in samples harboring 
a MutComFocal mutation to the distribution N of the number of mutations in 
each TCGA sample. Because the number of TCGA samples was well above 30, we 
assumed that N was well approximated by the normal distribution and calculated 
the mean, m, and s.d., s. For each MutComFocal mutation, we performed the 
Z-test and found that all mutations failed statistical significance after correction 
for multiple hypotheses by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Determining the presence of EGFRvIII transcripts. To determine the prevalence 
of EGFRvIII transcripts, we created an in-house script to calculate the number of 
split inserts and split reads supporting the junction between EGFR exons 1 and 
8. We considered the EGFRvIII isoform to be expressed if there were more than 
five split reads or five split inserts in a sample.

Calculating the relative expression of EGFR fusions compared to wild-type 
EGFR. To determine the functional relevance of EGFR-SEPT14 and EGFR-PSPH 
fusions, we determined the relative expression between the fusion and wild-type 
transcripts within each sample on the basis of BAM files mapped by TopHat and 
provided by TCGA. As a proxy for expression of the transcript, we calculated the 
depth of reads covering either a mutant or wild-type junction. In particular, we 
considered the depth of reads covering the fusion breakpoint of EGFR-SEPT14 
or EGFR-PSPH to estimate the expression of the fusion transcript. Because all 
EGFR fusions stereotypically involved exon 24 joined to either SEPT14 or PSPH, 
we considered the depth of reads covering the junctions between EGFR exons 
25–26, 26–27 and 27–28 to be a specific gauge of wild-type EGFR expression.

Enrichment of the classical and mesenchymal subtype among samples with 
EGFR fusions. To assess whether samples with EGFR fusions tended to occur in 
a particular GBM subtype, we first classified each TCGA GBM sample by expres-
sion according to the methods of Verhaak et al.6. We then tallied the number of 
classical, mesenchymal, proneural and neural samples with and without EGFR 
gene fusions. We found that the combined class of classical and mesenchymal 
phenotype was enriched for EGFR fusions according to the Fisher’s exact test.

Copy number variation in EGFR fusions. Gene fusions often arise from genomic 
instability. Motivated by this observation, we downloaded segmented SNP array 
data from TCGA and calculated the log2 ratio between the tumor and normal 
copy numbers. We plotted this along the chromosomal neighborhood of EGFR, 
SEPT14 and PSPH (chr7:55,000,000–56,500,000).

GSEA. To determine the biological impact of LZTR1 mutations, we used GSEA55, 
which is an analytical tool that harnesses expression data to nominate gene sets 
enriched for a particular phenotype. Having identified TCGA samples with 
LZTR1 SNVs, we applied GSEA to the TCGA expression data. We first compared 
samples with LZTR1 SNVs against those with wild-type LZTR1 (excluding LZTR1 
deletions). To assess statistical significance, we randomized our data set by per-
muting gene sets 500 times and considered only gene sets with an FDR q < 0.05.

Differential expression between samples with EGFR-SEPT14 and EGFRvIII. We 
also performed in-house differential expression analysis to determine a distinct 
molecular signature distinguishing the EGFR-SEPT14 and EGFRvIII phenotypes. 
Toward this end, we performed a t test comparing the expression of the two 
groups of samples for each gene. Correcting for multiple hypotheses using the 
Benjamini-Hochberg method, we considered only genes with FDR < 0.05. In 
addition, we excluded genes with a variance less than the tenth percentile or 
absolute value lower than two across all samples. These filters left a predictive 
set of ten genes. We then performed hierarchical clustering on the expression of 
these ten genes using Euclidean distance and average linkage.

regions of human LZTR1 were identified with HHpred56. An initial three-
dimensional model was generated with the I-TASSER server57. The CUL3 
N-terminal domain was docked onto the model by superposing the KLHL3BTB-
BACK/CUL3NTD  crystal  structure27  onto  the  second  LZTR1  BTB-BACK 
domain. The model does not include higher quaternary structure, although 
many BTB domains, and many kelch domains, are known to self associate25. 
The short linkage between the end of the first BACK domain and the begin-
ning of the second BTB domain would seem to preclude an intrachain BTB-
BTB pseudo-homodimer, and we expect that LZTR1 self associates and forms 
higher-order assemblies. Both BACK domains are the shorter, atypical form 
of the domain and consist of two helical hairpin motifs, as in SPOP26,58, and 
not the four-hairpin motif seen in most BTB-BACK-kelch proteins28,58. The 
model from the kelch domain predicts an unusual 1+3 velcro arrangement59, 
with the N-terminal region contributing strand d of blade 1 and the C-terminal 
region contributing strands a, b and c of the same blade, although we cannot 
rule out an alternative 2+2 velcro model.

Cell culture. U87 cells were obtained from ATCC. SNB19, U87 and HEK-293T 
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 
Growth rates were determined by plating cells in six-well plates at 3 d after infec-
tion with the lentivirus indicated in the figure legends. The number of viable cells 
was determined by Trypan blue exclusion in triplicate cultures obtained from 
triplicate independent infections. For the wound assay testing migration, conflu-
ent cells were scratched with a pipette tip and cultured in 0.25% FBS. After 16 h, 
images were taken using the Olympus IX70 connected to a digital camera. Images 
were processed using the ImageJ64 software. The area of the cell-free wound was 
assessed in triplicate samples. Experiments were repeated twice.

GBM-derived primary cultures were grown in DMEM:F12 medium con-
taining N2 and B27 supplements and human recombinant FGF-2 and EGF (50 
ng/ml each; Peprotech). For sphere formation, cells were infected with lenti-
viral particles. Four days later, single cells were plated at density of 1 cells per 
well in triplicate in low-attachment 96-well plates. The number and the size of 
spheres were scored after 10–14 d. Limiting dilution assays were performed as 
described previously60. Spheres were dissociated into single cells and plated in 
low-attachment 96-well plates in 0.2 ml of medium containing growth factors 
(EGF and FGF-2), except for the EGFR-transduced cells, which were cultured 
in the absence of EGF. Cultures were left undisturbed for 10 d, and then the per-
centage of wells not containing spheres for each cell dilution was calculated and 
plotted against the number of cells per well. Linear regression lines were plotted, 
and the number of cells required to generate at least one sphere in every well 
(the stem cell frequency) was calculated. The experiment was repeated twice. 
Treatment of GBM primary cultures with erlotinib or lapatinib was performed 
in cells transduced with the pLOC vector, wild-type pLOC-EGFR, EGFRvIII 
or EGFR-SEPT14 and selected with blasticidin for 5 d. Cells were seeded on 
6-cm dishes in the absence of EGF and treated with the indicated drugs at the 
indicated doses for 48 h. Each treatment group was seeded in triplicate. Absolute 
viable cell counts were determined by Trypan blue exclusion and counted on 
a hemocytometer. EGF stimulation of EGFR-transduced primary glioma cells 
was performed in cells deprived of growth factors for 48 h. Cells were collected 
at the indicated times and processed for protein blot analysis.

Immunofluorescence.  Immunofluorescence  staining  on  normal  mouse  and 
human brain and brain tumor tissue microarrays were performed as previously 
described43,61,62. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on cells fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Cells were permeabilized using 
0.2% Triton X-100. The antibodies and concentrations used in the immunofluo-
rescence staining are detailed in Supplementary Table 15.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:300, A11037, Molecular 
Probes) or Alexa 488 (1:500, A11008, Molecular Probes) were used. DNA was 
stained with DAPI (Sigma). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon 
A1R MP microscope. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity staining in 
primary or established glioma cells was performed using NIH ImageJ software 
(see URLs). A histogram of the intensity of fluorescence of each point of a rep-
resentative field for each condition was generated. The fluorescence intensity of 
ten fields from three independent experiments was scored, standardized to the 
number of cells in the field and divided by the intensity of the vector.

Protein blotting, immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding. Protein blot analy-
sis and immunoprecipitation were performed using the antibodies detailed in 
Supplementary Table 16. For the in vitro binding between CUL3 and LZTR1, 
wild-type and mutant LZTR1 were translated in vitro using the TNT Quick 
Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Flag-CUL3 was immu-
noprecipitated from transfected HEK-293T cells with Flag-M2 beads (Sigma) 
using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% 
sodium deoxycholate (DOC), 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 
(PMSF), 10 mM NaF, 0.5 M Na3OV4 (sodium orthovanadate) and Complete 
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). Binding was performed in 200 mM NaCl 
plus 0.5% NP-40 for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE 
and immunoblot.

Cloning and lentiviral production. The lentiviral expression vectors pLOC-GFP 
and pLOC-CTNND2 were purchased from Open Biosystems. Full-length EGFR-
SEPT14 cDNA was amplified from tumor sample TCGA-27-1837. Wild-type 
EGFR, EGFRvIII and EGFR-SEPT14 cDNAs were cloned into the pLOC vec-
tor. pCDNA-MYC-Hist-LZTR1 was a kind gift from J. Kroll (Tumor Biology 
Center,  Freiburg,  Germany)24.  pCDNA-Flag-CUL3  was  kindly  provided  by  
M. Pagano (New York University, New York, USA). Wild-type and mutant cDNAs 
for LZTR1 and CTNND2 obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II,  
Agilent) were cloned into the pLOC vector. Lentiviral particles were produced 
using published protocols43,61–64.

Genomic  PCR  and  RT-PCR.  Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  cells  using  an 
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Five-
hundred nanograms of total RNA was retrotranscribed using the Superscript III  
kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNAs obtained 
after  the  retrotranscription  were  used  as  templates  for  quantitative  PCR  as 
described43,64. The reaction was performed with a Roche480 thermal cycler 
using the Absolute Blue QPCR SYBR Green Mix from Thermo Scientific. The 
relative amount of specific mRNA was normalized to GAPDH. Results are pre-
sented as the mean ± s.d. of triplicate amplifications. The validation of fusion 
transcripts was performed using both genomic PCR and RT-PCR with forward 
and reverse primer combinations designed within the margins of the paired-end 
read sequences detected by RNA-seq. Expressed fusion transcript variants were 
subjected to direct sequencing to confirm the sequence and translation frame. 
The primers used for the screening of gene fusions are detailed in Supplementary 
Table 17. The primers used for genomic detection of gene fusions are listed in 
Supplementary Table 18. Semiquantitative RT-PCR to detect exogenous wild-
type MYC-LZTR1 and mutant p.Arg801Trp LZTR1 was performed using the 
primers listed in Supplementary Table 19.

Subcutaneous xenografts and drug treatment. Female athymic mice (nu/nu 
genotype, BALB/c background, 6–8 weeks old) were used for all antitumor stud-
ies. All animal procedures conformed to guidelines of the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Duke University (protocol number A107-
11-04 (3)) and the US National Institutes of Health. Patient-derived adult human 
glioblastoma  xenografts  were  maintained  at  the  Duke  Brain  Tumor  Center 
Biorepository (Institutional Review Board number Pro00007434) Xenografts 
were excised from host mice under sterile conditions and homogenized with 
the use of a tissue press and modified tissue cytosieve (Biowhitter Inc.), and 
tumor homogenate was loaded into a repeating Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, 
Co.) dispenser. Cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the 
athymic mouse at an inoculation volume of 50 ml with a 19-gauge needle65. 
Subcutaneous tumors were measured twice weekly with hand-held vernier cali-
pers (Scientific Products). Tumor volumes (V) were calculated with the following 
formula: ((width)2 × (length))/2 = V (mm3). For the subcutaneous tumor studies, 
groups of mice randomly selected by tumor volume were treated with EGFR 
kinase inhibitors when the median tumor volumes were an average of 150 mm3 
and were compared with control animals receiving vehicle (saline). Erlotinib 
was administered at 100 mg per kg body weight orally once per day for 10 d. 
Lapatinib was administered at 75 mg per kg body weight orally twice per day for 
20 d. Response to treatment was assessed by a delay in tumor growth and tumor 
regression. Growth delay, expressed as a T-C value, is defined as the difference 
in days between the median time required for tumors in treated and control 
animals to reach a volume five times greater than that measured at the start of

two successive measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using a SAS 
statistical analysis program, the Wilcoxon rank-order test for growth delay and 
Fisher’s exact test for tumor regression.

Intracranial injection. GBM-derived primary cells were first infected with a len-
tivirus expressing luciferase and subsequently transduced with the pLOC vector 
or pLOC-CTNND2 lentiviral particles. Intracranial injection was performed in 
9-week-old male nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) in accordance with 
guidelines of IACUC Committee. Briefly, 5 ≤ 105 cells were resuspended in  
2.5 ml of PBS and injected into the caudate putamen using a stereotaxic frame 
(coordinates relative to the bregma: 0.6 mm anterior; 1.65 mm medium-lateral; 
3 mm depth-ventral). Tumor growth was monitored using the IVIS Imaging 
system. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane before intraperitoneal 
injection of 100 mg per kg body weight n-luciferin (Xenogen). Ten minutes 
after injection of n-luciferin, images were acquired for 1 min with the Xenogen 
IVIS system (Xenogen) using Living Image acquisition and analysis software 
(Xenogen). The bioluminescent signal was expressed in photons per second 
and displayed as a pseudo-color image representing the spatial distribution of 
photon counts.

Statistics and survival analyses. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for CTNND2 
CNVs and CTNND2 expression were obtained using the REMBRANDT glioma 
data set.
