Key words: ErbB3, antibodies, internalization, epitope mapping, melanoma

Members of the erbB receptor family are targets of a growing numbers of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies 
inhibitors  currently  under  development  for  the  treatment  of  cancer.  Although  historical  efforts  have  been  directed 
against erbB1 (eGFR) and erbB2 (HeR2/neu), emerging evidences have pointed to erbB3 as a key node in the activation 
of  proliferation/survival  pathways  from  the  erbB  receptor  family  and  have  fueled  enthusiasm  toward  the  clinical 
development of anti-erbB3 agents. In this study, we have evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of a set of three 
recently generated anti-human erbB3 monoclonals, A2, A3 and A4, in human primary melanoma cells. We show that in 
melanoma cells expressing erbB1, erbB3 and erbB4 but not erbB2 receptor ligands activate the pI3K/AKt pathway, and 
this leads to increased cell proliferation and migration. While antibodies A3 and A4 are able to potently inhibit ligand-
induced signaling, proliferation and migration, antibody A2 is unable to exert this effect. In attempt to understand the 
mechanism of action and the basis of this different behavior, we demonstrate, through a series of combined approaches, 
that antibody efficacy strongly correlates with antibody-induced receptor internalization, degradation and inhibition of 
receptor recycling to the cell surface. Finally, fine epitope mapping studies through a peptide array show that inhibiting 
vs. non-inhibiting antibodies have a dramatically different mode of binding to the receptor extracellular domain. our 
study confirms the key role of erbB3 and points to exploitation of novel combination therapies for treatment of malignant 
melanoma.

Introduction

Malignant  melanoma  is  the  deadliest  form  of  skin  cancer  for 
its  high  proliferative  rate  and  propensity  to  establish  metasta-
sis in several organs.1 Although treatment options have recently 
increased thanks to the approval of two new drugs with distinct 
mechanisms of action, namely, immunotherapy with the mono-
clonal  anti-CTLA4  antibody  ipilimumab2  and  targeted  ther-
apy  with  vemurafenib,3  a  selective  BRAF  inhibitor  for  patients 
carrying  the  V600E  BRAF  mutation,  the  5-year  survival  still 
remains very low due to the intrinsically highly aggressive and 
metastatic nature of this type of cancer as well as, in the case of 
BRAF inhibitors, to the rapid development of resistance.4 Hence, 
research is constantly pursuing additional strategies for interven-
tion that could allow the development of more effective combina-
tion treatments.

During  the  last  two  decades,  members  of  the  EGF  recep-
tor family have become prominent targets for the treatment of 

several types of cancers thanks to their key role in the activation 
of the PI3K/Akt proliferation and survival signaling pathways.5,6 
The EGFR superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of 
four distinct members, namely, ErbB1 (EGFR/HER1), ErbB2 
(HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), ErbB4 (HER4), which are spa-
tially and temporally regulated by a wealth of ligands.7 Small 
molecules  and  monoclonal  antibodies  developed  against  two 
members of this family, namely, EGFR and HER2, have dem-
onstrated therapeutic efficacy and have been approved for the 
treatment  of  several  forms  of  cancers,  including  breast,  lung, 
colorectal, gastric and head and neck cancers.7

In  recent  years,  ErbB3  has  emerged  as  a  key  player  in  the 
establishment  of  malignancy.8  Disregarded  for  several  years, 
largely because of the absence of detectable ErbB3 mutations in 
cancer samples and for the lack of a functional kinase domain 
in  its  intra-cytoplasmic  region,9  ErbB3  is  instead  one  of  the 
most potent activators of the PI3K/Akt axis because of the pres-
ence of six tyrosine residues in its intracytoplasmic tail, many

of  which,  when  trans-phosphorylated  by  other  receptor  tyro-
sine kinases (RTKs), become high affinity binding sites for the 
regulatory subunit of PI3K.10 ErbB3 has been shown to be an 
obligate partner for ErbB2-mediated transformation11,12 and is 
upregulated and trans-phosphorylated in several forms of can-
cer,  in  particular  following  treatment  with  EGFR  and  ErbB2 
inhibitors.13,14 Hence, a growing number of evidences point to 
ErbB3 as an important factor in the establishment of resistance 
to therapies. Furthermore, ErbB3 overexpression and its activa-
tion of the PI3K pathway have been shown to be required for 
the  early  metastatic  steps  of  motility  and  invasion  by  cancer 
cells.15

The  relevance  of  EGFR  family  members  in  melanoma  has 
been the subject of a limited number studies, and this in spite 
of  the  evidence  of  high-level  expression  during  malignant  pro-
gression16 and the importance of the activation of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway in progression to metastasis as well in this form of can-
cer.17 More recently, it has been suggested that ErbB3 signaling 
is capable of inhibiting differentiation genes in melanocytes and 
melanoma cells and of promoting their proliferation.18 This led 
us  to  postulate  that  targeting  ErbB3  activation  may  provide  a 
new therapeutic option for malignant melanoma.

Due  to  the  lack  of  intrinsic  tyrosine  kinase  activity,  ErbB3 
cannot be targeted by canonical TKIs. However, its inhibition 
can be achieved by monoclonal antibodies recognizing the extra-
cellular domain. Indeed, monoclonal antibodies against human 
ErbB3 have been generated in recent years and have been shown 
to inhibit proliferation in vitro and in vivo of several cancer cell 
lines.19-21 Our group has recently generated and characterized a set 
of mouse monoclonal antibodies against human ErbB3 obtained 
by  immunizations  with  a  mutant  form  of  the  receptor,  which 
constitutively adopts and extended conformation.22 We showed 
that our antibodies are able to bind human ErbB3 with low nM 
affinity, inhibit heregulin-induced signaling and affect cell pro-
liferation in vitro and in vivo in a variety of cell lines. Most inter-
estingly,  one  of  our  anti-ErbB3  monoclonal  antibodies,  which 
cross-reacts with the murine ErbB3, was able to dampen growth 
of ErbB2-dependent spontaneous tumors in BALB/NeuT trans-
genic mice.

In  the  present  study,  we  have  evaluated  the  effect  of  anti-
human  ErbB3  monoclonals  on  melanoma  cell  growth  and 
migration.  We  provide  evidence  that  anti-ErbB3  monoclonals 
with similar receptor affinities but with distinct ability to induce 
receptor internalization and degradation, exert dramatically dif-
ferent  effects  on  inhibition  of  cell  signaling,  proliferation  and 
migration. Furthermore, in order to provide further insights into 
their mechanism of action, we compare the intracellular fate of 
ErbB3 receptor after cell exposure to inhibiting antibodies with 
that  induced  by  heregulin  and  establish  correlations  between 
antibody  efficacy  and  receptor 
internalization/degradation. 
Finally, epitope mapping studies provide the evidence that inter-
nalizing vs. non-internalizing antibodies interact with different 
domains of the receptor extracellular region. Our results indicate 
that  antibodies  capable  of  inducing  ErbB3  internalization  and 
degradation  have  the  features  required  of  potential  therapeutic 
agents for melanoma.

Results

A  family  of  anti-ErbB3  mAbs  differentially  interfere  with 
receptor signaling in melanoma cells. In order to study the effect 
of  anti-ErbB3  monoclonal  antibodies,  we  performed  an  initial 
screening  of  primary  melanoma  cell  lines  (not  shown)  for  the 
expression of members of the ErbB receptor family. This led to 
the identification of two cell lines, MST-L and Mel 501, which 
express high levels of EGFR and ErbB3 but not of ErbB2, the 
most potent ErbB3 partner in cell transformation.12 We decided 
to  focus  our  attention  on  these  two  cell  lines  as  representative 
example  of  melanomas,  where  ErbB3  could  exert  a  prominent 
role  in  the  activation  of  PI3K/Akt  signaling,  proliferation  and 
migration.

To assess the level of expression of members of ErbB family 
in  these  melanoma  cell  lines,  western  blot  analysis  were  per-
formed using extracts of cells grown in the presence of FBS or 
serum  starved  and  then  treated  with  HRG.  Results  (Fig.  1A) 
showed a band corresponding to the molecular weight of ErbB3 
both in Mel 501 and MST-L cells. Moreover, in both cell lines, 
specific bands corresponding to the molecular weight of ErbB1 
and  ErbB4  were  also  detectable,  while  no  band  corresponding 
to ErbB2 protein was visible. HeLa cells, expressing high levels 
of ErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB4 but no detectable ErbB3 were used 
as control.

We then examined whether the ErbB3 receptors would be cor-
rectly exposed on the cell surface and if their amount would be suf-
ficient to be visualized by immunostaining. Immunofluorescence 
analysis was performed by incubating unstimulated living cells 
at 4°C with a commercial anti-ErbB3 antibody directed against 
the extracellular portion of the receptor. Nuclei were labeled with 
DAPI.  Receptor  staining  was  clearly  detectable  at  the  level  of 
the plasma membrane and appeared uniform in both Mel 501 
and MST-L (Fig. 1B). In contrast, HeLa cells were unlabeled, as 
expected (Fig. 1B).

Since ErbB3 is the most potent activator of the PI3K/Akt axis, 
and many evidences point to the ligand-dependent activation of 
PI3K/Akt signaling through heterodimerization of ErbB3 with 
other  ErbBs  or  RTKs  as  crucial  events  in  the  establishment  of 
resistance to anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 therapies in many dif-
ferent cancers,8 we analyzed PI3K/Akt signaling in Mel 501 and 
MST-L cells and tested their responsiveness to exogenous HRG. 
Cells were grown in the presence of FBS or serum starved and 
then  stimulated  with  HRG.  The  amount  of  ErbB3  and  Akt 
phosphorylation  was  assessed  by  western  blot  analysis  using 
anti-pErbB3 and anti-pAkt antibodies. As shown in Figure 2A, 
ErbB3 phosphorylation was evident only upon HRG treatment 
in both cell types, while basal Akt phosphorylation was clearly 
increased after ligand stimulation. Thus, the PI3K/Akt signaling 
can be highly induced by HRG stimulation in both melanoma 
cells and is probably triggered by ErbB3 heterodimerization with 
ErbB1 and/or ErbB4.

Three  distinct  anti-ErbB3  monoclonal  antibodies  (mAbs) 
named  A2,  A3  and  A4  having  similar  binding  affinity  for  the 
receptor (Kd 5.5 nM ± 0.66; 4.40 nM ± 0.31; 2.43 nM ± 0.13 for 
A2, A3 and A4, respectively) but different capability to inhibit

corresponding  to  pErbB3  and  pAkt 
decreased

with  saturating  amounts  of  A3  and

A4  mAbs  specifically  bind  ErbB3,22 
these results indicate that the ligand-
dependent  activation  of  the  Akt 
pathway 
is  mainly  mediated  by 
ErbB3 in both Mel 501 and MST-L 
cells.  In  contrast,  pre-incubation 
with the A2 mAb produced no effect 
on  HRG-induced  receptor  and  Akt 
phosphorylation (Fig. 2B).

the response to HRG (Fig. 4). In conclu-
sion, A3 and A4, but not A2, are able to 
significantly interfere with the biological 
activity  of  HRG  by  blocking  melanoma 
cell proliferation and migration.

Anti-ErbB3  mAbs 

differentially 
affect  receptor  endocytosis  and  degra-
dation. In order to provide insights into 
the mechanism of action of our antibod-
ies, we decided to study the fate of ErbB3 
receptor  upon  antibody  ligation.  It  has 
been reported that anti-ErbBs mAbs can 
inhibit the downstream signaling induc-
ing  receptor  downregulation.  This  has 
been related to antibody-induced receptor 
internalization  and  consequent  degrada-
tion.24,25 Therefore, we wondered whether 
the different interfering effect of A2, A3 
and  A4  on  ErbB3  phosphorylation  and 
signaling can be linked to a different abil-
ity to trigger ErbB3 internalization.

Figure 2. (A) Western blot analysis performed using anti-peRBB3 and anti-pAkt antibodies in 
Mel 501 and MSt-L cells grown in the presence of FBS or serum starved and then stimulated with 
HRG for 10 min as reported in materials and methods. eRBB3 phosphorylation is evident only 
upon HRG treatment in both cell types. the basal Akt phosphorylation is visible in FBS-treated 
or serum-starved cells and is increased by ligand stimulation. the equal loading was assessed 
with anti-GApDH antibodies. (B) Western blot analysis in Mel 501 and MSt-L cells serum starved 
pre-incubated with each anti-eRBB3 mAb for 1 h at 37°C and then stimulated with HRG as above 
in the presence of the antibody. the phosphorylation of eRBB3 and Akt induced by HRG treatment 
is greatly decreased following incubation with A3 and A4 mAbs; pre-incubation with the A2 mAb 
does not affect HRG-induced phosphorylation of either receptor or Akt. the equal loading was 
assessed with anti-GApDH antibodies.

monoclonals, we compared the proliferative response of Mel 501 
and MST-L cells pre-treated with each mAb and then incubated 
with HRG for 48 and 72 h in the presence of the mAbs. After 
incubation, cells were fixed and stained with anti-Ki67 antibod-
ies to identify cycling cells. Quantitative analysis of the percent-
age  of  cells  presenting  Ki67-positive  nuclei  indicated  that  the 
increase  of  the  proliferation  rate,  clearly  evident  upon  48  and 
72  of  HRG  stimulation,  was  strongly  and  significantly  inhib-
ited only by A3 and A4 mAbs (Fig. 3). In contrast, the minor 
decrease of Ki67-positive cells induced by the A2 mAb was not 
significant (Fig. 3).

Since  it  has  been  reported  that  some  anti-EGFR  mAbs  are 
able to impede both proliferation and migration of some tumor 
cell lines in which the receptor is overexpressed,23 we wondered 
whether, A2, A3 and A4 mAbs could also differently affect migra-
tion. Since no significant differences emerged between Mel 501 
and MST-L cells in the proliferative assay, we decided to perform 
a migration assay only on MST-L cells. Results (Fig. 4) clearly 
indicated that HRG stimulated cell migration, and that A3 and 
A4 mAbs strongly interfere with the migrating effect induced by 
the ligand of ErbBs (Fig. 4), while the A2 mAb did not affect 

Mel 501 and MST-L cells were treated 
with  A2,  A3  or  A4  mAbs  for  1  h  at 
37°C  before  fixation  to  allow  endocy-
tosis  of  antibody  receptor  complexes. 
Immunofluorescence  analysis  performed 
using a secondary anti-mouse FITC anti-
body  clearly  showed  that  in  both  cell 
lines,  the  signal  corresponding  to  either 
A3  or  A4  antibodies  appeared  clustered 
in endocytic, intracellular dots dispersed 
throughout  the  cytoplasm  (Fig.  5A); 
in  contrast,  the  signal  of  A2  antibody 
remained  uniformly  distributed  on  the 
plasma membrane (Fig. 5A). Based on the 
observation that A2 antibody alone is not able to trigger ErbB3 
endocytosis and does not compete with the ligand for binding to 
the receptor, we incubated melanoma cells simultaneously with 
HRG and A2 antibody: the signal of A2 mAb bound to ErbB3 
became intracellular as a consequence of ligand-dependent inter-
nalization (Fig. 5A).

To  quantify  the  amount  of  ErbB3  receptors  that  remained 
localized  on  the  plasma  membrane  upon  incubation  with  the 
three mAbs, internalization experiments were performed, incu-
bating Mel 501 and MST-L cells with each of the mAbs for 1 h 
at 4°C in order to permit binding on the plasma membrane only 
(Fig. 5B, upper parts) or for 1 h at 37°C as above to allow the 
possible  uptake  of  the  receptor-antibody  complexes  (Fig.  5B, 
lower parts). The plasma membranes were visualized by incubat-
ing the cells with the lipophilic tracer Vybrant DiI at 4°C before 
fixation. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis showed that, 
upon incubation at 4°C, the signals corresponding to all three 
mAbs highly colocalized with DiI (ranging from 80% to 95%) at 
the cell plasma membranes, indicating efficient binding in con-
ditions of internalization block. In contrast, upon incubation at 
37°C,  the  colocalization  of  A3  and  A4  with  DiI,  but  not  that

in the percentage of colocalization of A2 mAb with the plasma 
membrane  marker  at  37°C  compared  with  the  binding  at  4°C 
was not significant.

It has been previously shown in tumor cells in which ErbB3 
is highly expressed that this receptor does not undergo efficient 
ligand-dependent downregulation.26 In order to clarify whether 
the  internalization  of  ErbB3  caused  by  A3  and  A4  antibodies, 
differently from that triggered by the ligand HRG, might induce 
receptor targeting to the endocytic lysosomal degradative path-
way, Mel 501 and MST-L cells were treated with A3, A4 or with 
HRG  for  1  h  at  37°C  in  the  presence  of  LysoTracker-Red  to 
identify the lysosomal compartment. In HRG-treated cells, co-
incubation with A2 mAb was performed to follow the internal-
izing  ErbB3.  Quantitative  immunofluorescence  analysis  clearly 

demonstrated colocalization of ErbB3-bound A3 and A4 mAbs 
with  the  LysoTracker  marker  in  intracellular,  perinuclear  dots 
corresponding to lysosomes, while no colocalization was observed 
with ErbB3 internalized following HRG treatment (Fig. 6).

In order to verify whether the ErbB3 targeting to the endo-
cytic  degradative  pathway  induced  by  A3  and  A4  would  actu-
ally correspond to efficient receptor degradation, we analyzed the 
kinetics of ErbB3 degradation in MST-L cells treated with HRG 
or with A2, A3 or A4 mAbs at 37°C for different time points. 
Western  blot  analysis  using  anti-ErbB3  antibodies  showed  a 
drastic decrease of the band already after 1 h of treatment with 
A3 or A4 mAbs, remaining at very low levels at 8 and 24 h of 
incubation, while upon HRG stimulation, the receptor band was 
only  slightly  decreased  after  1  and  8  h  of  stimulation  but  was 
completely recovered after 24 h (Fig. 7). In contrast, the band

first is represented by A3 and A4, which are able to block ligand-
induced signal transduction, cell proliferation and migration to 
induce receptor degradation and block its recycling, the second 
represented by A2, which is unable to inhibit ligand-induced sig-
naling  and  to  induce  receptor  internalization  and  degradation. 
In  order  to  better  dissect  the  molecular  basis  of  their  different 
biological behavior, we decided to map the receptor binding sites 
recognized by the A2 and A3 antibodies, respectively.

To determine the epitopes, an ELISA-based epitope binding 
assay was set up.27 For this purpose, a library of 15mer peptides 
overlapping by 11 residues and covering the entire ErbB3 extra-
cellular region was built, and individual peptides were plated on 
a 96-well plate, using as control the entire ErbB3 recombinant 
extracellular domain, and subjected to an Elisa assay using A2, 
A3 and A4. The results are shown in Figure 9. Quantitative anal-
ysis of signal intensity (Fig. 9A–C) showed that mAbs A2 and 
A3 recognize different epitopes contained within peptide CWG 
PGP GQC LSC RNY the A2 mAb and within peptide QCN 
GHC FGP NPN QCC the A3 mAb, respectively. No signal was 
detected for A4, thus suggesting indirectly that this is a complex 
epitope. Interestingly, the two recognized epitopes are located in 
two structurally distinct regions of the protein;28 in fact, while 
the A2 epitope is located in sub-domain 4, closer to the juxta-
membrane  region,  the  A3  epitope  is  located  within  domain  2 
(Fig. 9B–D).

Discussion

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has been hypoth-
esized to play a role in the development of melanoma. Among 
RTKs, several members of the ErbB receptor family are either fre-
quently upregulated (EGFR and ErbB3) or mutated (ErbB4) in 
melanoma.29 A further demonstration of the involvement of this 
receptor family in melanoma cell proliferation derives from the 
observation that the RTK inhibitor gefitinib partially decreases 
proliferation  of  human  melanoma  cells.30  Furthermore,  in  a 
recent study, Renscke and coworkers have shown by tissue micro-
array analysis on a large set of tumor samples that ErbB3 expres-
sion  may  serve  as  a  prognostic  marker,  because  its  expression 
correlates with cell proliferation, tumor progression and reduced 
patient survival.31 Moreover, the same study has shown that sup-
pression of ErbB3 expression by RNA interference reduces mela-
noma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Hence, 
we have focused our attention on ErbB3 in a subset of human 
melanoma  cells  that  co-express  ErbB1,  ErbB4  and  ErbB3  and 
that are apparently devoid of detectable amounts of ErbB2, and 
have analyzed in these cells the mechanism of action of a set of 
anti-human ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies recently generated by 
our group.22

We confirm that melanoma cells are responsive to ligands of 
the ErbB family, such as heregulin, and show that ligand-depen-
dent  activation  of  AKT  signaling,  proliferation  and  migration 
can be fully abrogated by a subset of our anti ErbB3 monoclo-
nals. Interestingly, not all the anti-ErbB3 antibodies in our col-
lection  are  able  to  block  heregulin-induced  signaling,  because 
one  of  them,  namely,  A2,  is  unable  to  inhibit  ligand-induced

corresponding to ErbB3 remained virtually unaltered upon the 
treatment with A2 mAb (Fig. 7).

It has been recently hypothesized that the mechanism underly-
ing receptor downregulation induced by some anti-ErbBs mono-
clonal  antibodies  might  be  consistent  also  with  the  inhibition 
of receptor recycling to the cell surface.23 To ascertain whether 
A3 and A4 mAbs might also induce ErbB3 downregulation by 
interfering with the receptor recycling, MST-L cells were treated 
at 37°C with A3 or A4 for different time lengths (1, 6 and 24

visualized  by  re-incubating  cells  with  A3  at  4°C  before  fixa-
tion, was compared with that obtained upon HRG stimulation 
and quantified by assessing the receptor colocalization with the 
plasma  membrane  marker  DiI  as  described  above.  The  results 
showed that upon incubation for 1 h at 37°C with each antibody 
or with HRG, no receptor signal on the cell surface was evident 
(Fig. 8), while fluorescent intracellular dots corresponding to the 
internalized  A3-ErbB3  and  A4-ErbB3  complexes  were  clearly 
visible in permeabilized cells, confirming the antibody-induced 
receptor internalization (Fig. 8, top parts). After incubation for 
6 h  and 24 h, a  progressively increasing  receptor signal on the 
cell surface was evident upon HRG stimulation but not upon A3 
and A4 treatment (Fig. 8), demonstrating that, differently from 
the physiological ligand, which is known to induce ErbB3 recy-
cling to the cell surface,26 the two mAbs are able to downregulate 
ErbB3 not only by inducing its degradation, but also by blocking 
its physiological recycling.

Anti-ErbB3 mAbs A2 and A3 recognize two different bind-
ing sites. The experiments described above show that there are 
two distinct categories of ErbB3 receptor binding antibodies; the

ent time points (1, 8 and 24 h). A drastic decrease of the band corresponding to eRRB3 is evident after 1 h of treatment with A3 or A4 mAbs and persists 
at 8 and 24 h of incubation while upon HRG stimulation the receptor band is slightly decreased after 1 and 8 h of stimulation, and is recovered after

ErbB3 signaling in spite of a similar receptor binding affinity as 
compared with the “active” A3 and A4 monoclonals. This differ-
ent behavior prompted us to gain further insights into the mecha-
nism of action of active vs. non-active anti-ErbB3 antibodies.

Our main observation was that activity correlated with recep-
tor downregulation. When compared with heregulin, the ability 
of A3, and in particular A4, to downregulate ErbB3 receptor lev-
els was dramatic; while heregulin was capable to slightly decrease 
receptor levels up to residual 60% after 8 h of treatment, mAbs 
A3 and A4 led to residual 21 or 17% receptor levels in the same 
conditions. In contrast, the inactive A2 monoclonal was unable 
to reduce receptor levels. When we analyzed the reasons of this 
discrepancy  with  a  series  of  localization  studies,  we  observed 
that  all  three  antibodies  bound  ErbB3  receptor  on  the  plasma 
membrane  with  the  same  efficiency  in  conditions  of  blockade 
of  receptor  internalization,  but  only  the  two  active  antibodies 
triggered  receptor  internalization  at  37°  C.  Interestingly,  while 
A2 was unable to induce receptor internalization by itself, it did 
not block receptor internalization induced by heregulin, in line 
with its inability to compete with the ligand for binding to the 
receptor.

Another set of interesting observations comes from the com-
parison of receptor re-localization induced by heregulin or by the 
two  active  antibodies.  Upon  cell  exposure  to  heregulin,  ErbB3 
was clearly associated with intracellular vesicles that did not stain 
positive  for  the  lysosomal  dye  lysotracker.  This  is  in  line  with 
previous observations showing that ErbB3 is inefficiently sorted 
to the degradation pathway.32 This was confirmed by our find-
ing that sometime after exposure to the ligand, ErbB3 is recycled 
to  the  membrane  surface.  In  contrast,  antibodies  A3  and  A4 
induced  sorting  of  ErbB3  into  lysosomes  and  blocked  receptor 
recycling  back  to  the  cell  surface.  Previous  studies  conducted 
with  EGFR/ErbB3  receptor  chimeras  led  us  to  postulate  that, 
unlike ErbB1, which is naturally destined to lysosomal degrada-
tion through a ligand-induced mechanism that involves recruit-
ment of c-Cbl and receptor poly-ubiquitination, the C-terminal 
tail of ErbB3 is unable to recruit c-Cbl and shunts ErbB3 to the 
recycling pathway.32 This conclusion is, at least in part, contra-
dicted by our evidence that it is possible to induce ErbB3 receptor 
polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, but this depends 
upon the type of receptor binders. In fact we show that ErbB3 
can undergo alternative fates upon internalization: (1) recycling

E3 ligase, or if is due to de novo recruitment of other players such 
as c-Cbl.

Antibodies directed against the extracellular region of ErbB 
receptors have played important roles in our understanding of 
their  mechanism  of  activation.  Crystal  structures  of  the  Fab 
fragments from several different inhibitory antibodies in com-
plex  with  the  extracellular  region  of  EGFR,  ErbB2  and,  very 
recently,  ErbB3  have  been  determined  and  highlight  different 
modes of binding and mechanisms of receptor inhibition.21,34 In 
this context, the epitope mapping studies performed with two 
of our monoclonals allow us to establish an indirect comparison 
with the binding mode of clinically relevant monoclonals against 
other  receptors  of  the  same  family  and  to  make  the  following 
considerations. A2 binds to an epitope located within domain 
4, which makes its mode of binding similar to that of the anti-
ErbB2 mAb trastuzumab (HerceptinTM).28 Trastuzumab activity 
is  largely  restricted  to  breast  cancers  with  the  highest  level  of 
HER2 overexpression, while in cancers that have low or moder-
ate HER2 expression, this monoclonal antibody is not active.35 
Indeed  trastuzumab  does  not  impair  signaling  and  growth  in 
vitro of cells expressing moderate amounts of HER2-ErbB3 het-
erodimers (our data unpublished). Likewise, A2 is inactive both 
in  HER2-ErbB3  cells  (our  data  unpublished)  and  in  EGFR-
ErbB3-expressing cells such as MST-L and Mel 501 studied in 
the present work. Differently from A2, the anti-ErbB3 mono-
clonal A3 binds to an epitope located within domain 2, which 
makes  its  mode  of  binding  similar  to  that  of  the  anti-HER2 
mAb pertuzumab.36 Like pertuzumab, A3 shares the property of 
being a potent inhibitor of signal transduction and an inducer of 
receptor downregulation, also in conditions of low to moderate 
receptor expression. Based on this similarity, we expect A3 to be 
active in a variety of cancers, where ErbB3 is involved as a key 
node in PI3K/Akt signal transduction through the upregulation 
of heterodimers with EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB4 or other non-ErbB 
family RTKs. This finding is of particular relevance in light of 
the growing interest in the ErbB3/PI3K node as a potential target 
for anticancer therapy, which has led to the development of sev-
eral anti-human ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies.19-21 Interestingly, 
if we compare the mode of biding of our anti-ErbB3 antibody 

to the cell membrane when the receptor is engaged by its natural 
ligands such as heregulin; (2) lysosomal sorting and consequent 
degradation when engaged by non-natural ligands such as the A3 
and A4 monoclonal antibodies described here. The E3 ubiquitin 
ligase  Nrdp1  has  been  postulated  to  contribute  to  the  mainte-
nance of steady state ErbB3 levels by mediating its ligand-inde-
pendent degradation.33 In follow-up studies, it will be important,

It has been shown that combining

ing distinct epitopes exerts a superior 
antitumor effect compared to the use

effect is seen both in vivo and in vitro, 
it  is  likely  that  this  is  not  due  to  the 
involvement of immunological mecha-
nisms  but  to  a  more  powerful  down-
regulation  of  the  signaling  survival 
pathways of HER2-expressing cancer 
cells exerted by the antibodies combi-
nations.  Interestingly,  the  synergistic 
effect has been best observed when an

the dimerization site of HER2 is com-
bined  with  a  “non-active”  antibody

ies, it will be of relevance to assess the combinatorial effects of our 
anti-ErbB3 monoclonals among themselves or also in association

Materials and Methods

Cells  and  treatments.  Human  melanoma  cell  lines  Mel  50137 
and  MST-L  (kindly  provided  by  Dr.  Armando  Bartolazzi, 
Ospedale  Sant’Andrea)  were  cultured  in  RPMI  supplemented 
with 10% FBS. To induce ErbB3 signaling, cells were stimulated 
with 30 ng/ml HRG-β1 (HRG) for 10 min at 37°C. To interfere 
with  ErbB3  signaling,  cells  were  pre-incubated  with  10  μg/ml 
of A2, A3 or A4 monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 37°C before 
HRG stimulation. To induce the binding of anti-hErbB3 mono-
clonals  exclusively  to  the  plasma  membrane,  cells  were  incu-
bated with the antibodies for 1 h at 4°C. To analyze the possible 
internalization,  degradation  and  recycling  of  ErbB3,  cells  were 
stimulated with HRG 100 ng/ml or incubated with A2, A3 and 
A4  at  37°C  for  different  times  as  indicated.  For  the  visualiza-
tion  of  the  cell  surface,  plasma  membranes  were  labeled  with 
Vybrant DiL cell labeling solution for 1 h at 4°C before fixation. 
To induce LysoTracker internalization, cells were incubated with 
LysoTracker-Red for 1 h at 37°C and then fixed. For proliferation 
assays, cells were incubated with the anti-hErbB3 monoclonals 
for  1  h  at  37°C  and  then  stimulated  with  30  ng/ml  HRG  for 
48 or 72 h. For migration assays, cells were seeded in 6-well plates 
and they were serum starved in medium containing 0.1% FCS 
for 24 h. Cells were incubated with 100 μg/mL of antibodies for 
1 h, and 8,000 cells were then seeded either onto a membrane 
with 8 μm pores of a Boyden chamber (BD Biosciences) contain-
ing 50 μL serum-free medium. RPMI medium with 100 ng/ml 
of  HRG  was  used  as  a  chemoattractant  in  the  lower  chamber. 
The cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h. Migrated cells were 
stained  with  WST-1  (ROCHE)  and  analyzed  using  an  ELISA 
plate reader. The data are shown as mean ± SD. Western blots 
were performed as described in reference 22.

Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies against ErbB2, ErbB4, 
phospho-ErbB3  and  phospho-Akt  were  purchased  from  Cell 
Signaling  Technology.  Anti-EGFR,  -ErbB3,  -Akt  antibodies 
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-rabbit were 
purchased from AbCam. The rabbit anti-Ki67 polyclonal anti-
bodies  were  from  Zymed  Laboratories.  FITC-conjugated  goat 
anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Cappel Research Products. 
Texas  Red-conjugated  goat  anti-rabbit  IgG  were  from  Jackson 
Immunoresearch  Laboratories.  DAPI  was  purchased  from 
Sigma.  Human  HRG-1-β1  (HRG)  was  purchased  from  R&D 

Systems. Vybrant DiI cell labeling solution was from Invitrogen. 
LysoTracker-Red was obtained from Molecular Probes.

Immunofluorescence  analysis.  Melanoma  cells,  grown  on 
coverslips and incubated with the monoclonals A2, A3 and A4 
and/or stimulated with HRG as described above were fixed with 
4%  paraformaldehyde  in  PBS  for  30  min  at  25°C  followed  by 
treatment with 0.1 M glycine for 20 min at 25°C and with 0.1% 
Triton X-100 for an additional 5 min at 25°C to allow permeabi-
lization. To evaluate cell proliferation, cells were then incubated 
for 1 h at 25°C with the rabbit anti-Ki67 polyclonal antibodies. 
The  primary  antibodies  were  visualized  using  goat  anti-mouse 
IgG-FITC  and  goat  anti-rabbit  IgG-Texas  Red  for  30  min  at 
25°C.  Nuclei  were  stained  with  DAPI.  Coverslips  were  finally 
mounted  with  mowiol  for  observation.  To  assess  the  extent  of 
colocalization  of  fluorescence  signals,  cells  were  scanned  in  a 
series  of  0.5  μm  sequential  sections  with  an  ApoTome  System 
(Zeiss)  connected  with  an  Axiovert  200  inverted  microscope 
(Zeiss);  image  analysis  was  then  performed  by  the  Axiovision 
software and 3D reconstruction of a selection of three central out 
of the total number of the serial optical sections was shown in 
each figure. Quantitative analysis of the extent of colocalization 
was performed using Zeiss KS300 3.0 Image Processing system. 
The  mean  ±  standard  error  (SE)  percent  of  colocalization  was 
calculated, analyzing a minimum of 50 cells for each treatment 
randomly taken from three independent experiments. Percentage 
of Ki67-positive cells was obtained counting for each treatment 
a total of 500 cells, randomly observed in 10 microscopic fields 
from  three  different  experiments.  Results  have  been  expressed 
as mean values ± standard errors (SE). p-values were calculated 
using  Student  t-test,  and  significance  level  has  been  defined  as 
p < 0.05.

Epitope mapping. A human ErbB3 PepTrack Peptide Library 
was purchased from JPT (Jerini Peptide Technologies GmbH). 
Peptides were 15-mers overlapping by 11 residues and covered the 
entire extracellular region of the mature human ERBB3 receptor. 
96-well plates were coated with the peptides and antibody bind-
ing was assessed as described in reference 27.
