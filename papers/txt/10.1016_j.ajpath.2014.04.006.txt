Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are genetically diverse, aggressive sarcomas
that occur sporadically or in association with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 syndrome. Reduced TP53
gene expression and ampliﬁcation/overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
gene occur in MPNST formation. We focused on determining the cooperativity between reduced TP53
expression and EGFR overexpression for Schwann cell transformation in vitro (immortalized human
Schwann cells) and MPNST formation in vivo (transgenic mice). Human gene copy number alteration
data, microarray expression data, and TMA analysis indicate that TP53 haploinsufﬁciency and
increased EGFR expression co-occur in human MPNST samples. Concurrent modulation of EGFR and
TP53 expression in HSC1l cells signiﬁcantly increased proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth in vitro. Transgenic mice heterozygous for a Trp53-null allele and overexpressing EGFR in
Schwann cells had a signiﬁcant increase in neuroﬁbroma and grade 3 PNST (MPNST) formation
compared with single transgenic controls. Histological analysis of tumors identiﬁed a signiﬁcant
increase in pAkt expression in grade 3 PNSTs compared with neuroﬁbromas. Array comparative
genome hybridization analysis of grade 3 PNSTs identiﬁed recurrent focal regions of chromosomal
gains with signiﬁcant enrichment in genes involved in extracellular signaleregulated kinase 5
signaling. Collectively, altered p53 expression cooperates with overexpression of EGFR in Schwann
cells to enhance in vitro oncogenic properties and tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are
aggressive, malignant tumors of Schwann cell origin that
compose approximately 10% of diagnosed soft tissue sar-
comas. MPNSTs arise spontaneously or in association with
the inherited tumor predisposition syndrome neuroﬁbroma-
tosis type 1 (NF1). Sporadic MPNSTs have a 0.001% inci-
dence in the general population, whereas individuals with
NF1 (1 in 3500 people) have an 8% to 13% lifetime risk of
developing MPNSTs.1e3 MPNSTs are the most common
malignancy in adults with NF1 and the leading cause of NF1-
related mortality. Because of the invasive nature and high

incidence of metastasis of MPNSTs, surgical resection,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapeutic treatments have proved
to be ineffective for long-term treatment, resulting in 5-year
survival rates of approximately 40%.1,4e6 The severity and
lack of adequate treatments for MPNSTs emphasize the need
for improved understanding of the genetic basis of these
tumors.

Currently, few genetic drivers are implicated in benign
neuroﬁbroma formation and further progression into MPNSTs.
The most commonly altered known gene is NF1, which
encodes the neuroﬁbromin 1 protein, an RAS-GTPasee
activating protein that causes NF1 syndrome when inherited in
a mutated form.7e10 Mutations in the NF1 gene are also
observed in approximately 40% of sporadic MPNSTs.11
Deletion or mutation of the NF1 gene in cells causes
increased and aberrant signaling through progrowth and pro-
proliferation signaling pathways
[RAS/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signaleregulated kinase
(ERK)
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)] in human neuroﬁ-
bromas and MPNST-derived cell lines.12e14 However, NF1
gene loss alone likely is not sufﬁcient for MPNST formation on
the basis of results from genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMMs).15 Increased expression of growth factor receptors
and ligands, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
NRG, PDGF, HGF, SCF, and TGFb1, is also stimulated in
neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs with NF1 mutation.16e21 In
addition to NF1 mutations, few genomic aberrations have been
identiﬁed in neuroﬁbromas.22 However, genomic aberrations,
such as copy number alterations (CNAs), commonly occur in
MPNSTs, suggesting that progression from benign to malig-
nant tumor formation requires many cooperating genomic al-
terations.22 Deletions and/or mutations of cell cycle regulators
TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A and gene ampliﬁcation of growth
factor receptor genes ERBB2, EGFR, KIT, MET, and PDGFR
are identiﬁed in human MPNSTs.23e34 However, identiﬁcation
of genetic drivers of MPNST formation is hindered because of
the hyperdiploid or near-triploid genomes of MPNSTs.35e42
In addition to NF1 mutations, genetic alterations in TP53
and EGFR genes frequently occur in human MPNSTs.
Deletions and/or point mutations of TP53 occur in ap-
proximately 75% of human MPNSTs, but rarely inactivate
both alleles, suggesting haploinsufﬁciency is sufﬁcient for
MPNST formation.43 Moreover, a GEMM with cis-linked
Nf1- and Trp53-null mutations (NPcis mice) rapidly de-
velops sarcomas, including MPNSTs, in which not all tu-
mors undergo loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type
(WT) Nf1 and Trp53 alleles.44,45 EGFR gene ampliﬁcation
and/or overexpression occur in 25% to 75% of human
MPNSTs.25,46e48 Transgenic mice overexpressing human
EGFR in Schwann cells and their precursors display a nerve
hyperplasia phenotype with features of early-stage neuroﬁ-
broma pathogenesis and rare incidence of benign neuroﬁ-
broma formation, but no MPNST.49 Furthermore, inhibition
of EGFR signaling in NPcis mice with a hypomorphic allele
of EGFR increased survival compared with NPcis mice with

EGFR/Trp53 Cooperate for MPNST Formation

intact EGFR signaling.49 Finally, inhibition of EGFR kinase
activity in cell cultureebased assays reduced migration of
MPNST cells.50 These results suggest that aberrant EGFR
expression is involved in MPNST progression, but only in the
context of other mutations. For example, in human esopha-
geal cancer, EGFR overexpression and TP53 mutations
frequently co-occur, and in vitro human esophageal epithelial
cells can be transformed by overexpression of WT EGFR,
activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase, and reduced
TP53 expression by RNA interference.51,52 Anecdotally, a
human cell line derived from an NF1-associated MPNST had
EGFR gene ampliﬁcation and deletion of exons 5 to 8 within
the TP53 gene.53

Herein, we assessed the cooperativity of WT EGFR over-
expression and reduced TP53 expression in a CDK4 and
telomerase reverse transcriptase immortalized human Schwann
cell line (iHSC1l) and with GEMMs. HSC1l cells over-
expressing EGFR with reduced TP53 expression have a sig-
niﬁcant increase in proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth, phenotypes characteristic of oncogenic transformation.
Transgenic mice heterozygous for Trp53 and overexpressing
EGFR in Schwann cells have a signiﬁcant increase in Schwann
cell tumorigenesis compared with single transgenic controls.
Schwann cell tumors in these mice histologically resemble
human neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs. Genetic analysis of tu-
mors and tumor-derived cell lines demonstrate frequent loss of
the Trp53 WT allele and a high incidence of aneuploidy with
CNA gains on chromosomes 4, 5, 8, and 15. Collectively, the
data demonstrate cooperativity between EGFR overexpression
and p53 haploinsufﬁciency for Schwann cell tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Gene Expression Data Analysis

Published data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession number GSE14038;
Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0) were used for gene
expression pattern analysis. For gene annotation, custom CDF
(custom GeneChip library ﬁle), on the basis of reference
sequence target deﬁnitions (Hs133P REFSEQ version 8,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), was downloaded and
used to provide accurate interpretation of GeneChip data.54

Statistical comparisons were done using R/Bioconductor
packages and GeneSpring GX, version 7.3.1 (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA). Differentially expressed genes
were deﬁned as genes with expression levels at least threefold
higher or lower in target groups (MPNST) compared with
normal human Schwann cells after applying Benjamini and
Hochberg55 false-discovery rate correction (P  0.05).

MPNST Whole-Methylome Data Analysis

bromas, and MPNST genomes in the Gene Expression

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo;

Omnibus
accession
number GSE21714). We adopted the Feber et al56 method for
detecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in MPNST
compared with NHSC.57 Brieﬂy, Batman methylation scores
per 100 bp were averaged for each 1000-bp window. A con-
servative threshold for DMR calling was used, on the basis of
the 95th percentile of the difference in methylation score. DMR
regions were mapped to human genome build version hg18
(National Center for Biotechnology Information-36).

The nearest CpG island shores (CpG-IS) to the transcription
start sites of each gene/miRNA were scanned.56,57 We deﬁned
CpG-IS as areas up to 2 kilobases in distances from CpG islands.
We considered the nearest upstream CpG-IS from the tran-
scription start site, within 5000 bp, ranges from each tran-
scription start sites. The genomic coordinates of miRNAs,
genes, and CpG islands (National Center for Biotechnology
Information 36/hg18) were extracted from corresponding tracks
of the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Browser
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway,
accessed
January 9, 2013). In case of intragenic miRNAs, we assumed
that their expression is inﬂuenced by the nearest CpG-IS to the
transcription start site of their host gene.

CNA Data Analysis

CNA data on 51 primary MPNSTs were from the published
GSE33881 data set [Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray
kit (4  44,000), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov].58,59 A circular
binary segmentation algorithm was applied to the log2 ratios of
intensity values from tumor and normal to reduce local noise
effects. Circular binary segmentation calculates a likelihood-
ratio statistic for each array probe by permutation to locate
change points.60 After the segmentation step, a CGH call algo-
rithm was used to assign each segment an aberration label: gain,
loss, or normal.61 A visualization program was written in R
(http://www.r-project.org) to present overall gain/loss patterns
of all 51 MPNSTs. Genomic coordinates used in plots were
based on hg19/GRCh37.p8 (R/Bioconductor biomaRt package;
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA).62

TMA Data

Representative areas of disease were identiﬁed on H&E-
stained sections for 30 dermal neuroﬁbromas, 31 plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, and 32 MPNSTs. Blocks consisting of dupli-
cate 1.0-mm core samples were constructed with a manual
tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments Inc., Sun Prairie, WI) and
limited to 64 cores per recipient block. Unstained tissue
microarray (TMA) sections (4 mm thick) were deparafﬁnized
and rehydrated using standard methods. Slides went through
antigen retrieval and were incubated in pH 6.0 buffer (Reveal
Decloaking reagent; Biocare Medical Inc., Concord, CA) in a

steamer for 30 minutes at 95
C, followed by a 20-
minute cool down period. Slides were rinsed in running tap
water, followed by immersion in 1 Tris-buffered saline/0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST; pH 7.4). Endogenous peroxidase activity

was quenched by slide immersion in 3% hydrogen peroxide
solution (Peroxidazed; Biocare Medical Inc.) for 10 minutes,
followed by a TBST rinse. A serum-free blocking solution
(Background Sniper; Biocare Medical Inc.) was placed on
sections for 30 minutes. Blocking solution was removed, and
slides were incubated in primary antibody diluted in 10%
blocking solution/90% TBST. Anti-EGFR (1:500; Sigma

C,
Prestige, St. Louis, MO) was incubated overnight at 4
followed by a TBST rinse and detection with Alexa Fluor 488
(1:500; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) for 2 hours at room
temperature. Next, slides were immersed in TBST. A second
application of blocking solution (Background Sniper) was
applied for 10 minutes, followed by p53 (1:2000; Dako,
Carpinteria, CA), incubated for 60 minutes at room tempera-
ture, and rinsed in TBST. Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500; Invitrogen)
was applied for 2 hours at room temperature. Slides were
rinsed in TBST, followed by distilled water, and coverslipped
using ProLong Gold Anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen).

Cell Cultures/Assays



Immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSC1l) were acquired
from the laboratory of Dr. Margaret Wallace. iHSC1l cells
were cultured in complete media [1 Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1
penicillin/streptomycin] and grown at 37
C in 5% CO2.
Proliferation assays were set up in a 96-well plate format with
500 cells per well in full DMEM media containing 1 mg/mL
of puromycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Prolifera-
tion was assessed every 24 hours for 5 days using the Cell-
Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay
(Promega, Madison, WI)
following the manufacturer’s
protocols. Cultured cells were plated at 500 cells per well of a
96-well plate in replicates of 10. Measurements were taken
on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the BioTek Synergy MX
automated plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Experi-
ments were performed in triplicate. Soft agar anchorage-
independent colony formation assays were performed as
previously described.63 After 2 weeks of growth, cells were
ﬁxed in 10% formalin containing 0.005% crystal violet for 1
hour at room temperature. Formalin was removed, and col-
onies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope (Leica
Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Twelve images per
cell line were taken, and automated colony counts were done
using ImageJ software version 1.48 (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Cell Culture Constructs

EGFR cDNA (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and the shTP53
(OpenBiosystems, Pittsburg, PA) were cloned into the
Gateway Vector System (Life Technologies) and subcloned
into a piggyBac (PB) transposon vector, as previously
described.64 The PB control vector contains the Luciferase
and Gfp reporter genes. Cells were transfected with 2 mg of
EGFR/shTP53, EGFR, shTP53, or Luciferase PB transposon
(Supplemental Figure S1A) and 500 ng of PB7 transposase

Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were
generated against the human TP53 locus using a previously
established protocol.65 Brieﬂy, the ﬁrst coding exon of the TP53

human EGFR cDNA (Cnp-EGFR) has been previously
described.49 Transgenic mouse harboring a conditional Trp53
allele possessing an R270H point mutation in exon 8 has been
previously described.66 For our experiments, this was never
bred to a Cre-expressing mouse. Therefore, the dominant
negative allele was never expressed but used as a marker for
the null allele, essentially making every cell in the mouse
heterozygous for Trp53. We refer to this allele as Trp53
to
indicate it is not expressed because of the presence of a ﬂoxed
stop cassette in intron 1.66 Single transgenic mice were crossed
to obtain double transgenic experimental mice possessing one
allele of each transgene. All animal work was conducted under
an institutionally approved animal welfare protocol.

PCR Genotyping

Genotypes of transgenic mice were determined using a PCR-
based approach: First, genomic DNA was isolated from tail
clippings using standard proteinase K treatment, phenol-
chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Genomic
DNA was resuspended in sterile Tris-EDTA buffer [10 mmol/
L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8)] and
quantiﬁed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). PCR genotyping was performed
using 100 ng of diluted genomic DNA as template in a 25-mL
PCR volume. PCR primers used for Cnp-EGFR were as fol-

Tumor Analysis

Mice were monitored three times a week for changes in
mobility (paralysis), frank tumor development >1 cm, or
moribundity. If mice met one of the criteria, they were culled
and tumors were carefully removed from the sacriﬁced animal
under a dissecting microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc.),
washed, and placed in cold PBS. These separated tumors were
split into samples for DNA, RNA, and protein extraction. Tis-
sue samples for RNA were stored at  80

C in RNAlater
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to prevent RNase contamina-
tion and degradation. DNA extraction was done as previously
described in the PCR genotyping section. Extraction of RNA
was done using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) using
protocols described by the manufacturer. Protein extraction was
performed using standard isolation techniques. Histological
sections were only taken for larger tumors (>2 mm in diam-
eter). Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections from various
tissues were divided into sections (5 mm thick) using a standard
microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.), mounted, and heat ﬁxed
onto glass slides. Tissue section slides were either stained with
H&E using standard protocols or used for immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) as described in the next section.

IHC Data

Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded
in parafﬁn blocks. Sections were cut (5 mm thick) and
rehydrated through a series of graded ethanols. Slides un-
derwent antigen retrieval by boiling for 30 minutes in an-
tigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories
Inc.,
Burlington, CA). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched
with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes. For
antibody staining, a M.O.M. kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.)
was used for blocking and antibody incubations. Primary
antibodies used were as follows: mouse antieKi-67 (1:100;
Leica Microsystems Inc.), rabbit anti-S100b (1:100; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), rabbit anti-EGFR (1:100;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit antie
phosphorylated (phospho)-EGFR (1:400; Cell Signaling
Technology), mouse anti-p53 (1:100; Cell Signaling Tech-
nology), mouse anti-p21 (1:100; BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA), rabbit antiephospho-Erk (1:100; Cell Signaling
Technology), and rabbit antiephospho-Akt (1:100; Cell

Signaling Technology). After a series of washes, slides were
incubated with the corresponding anti-mouse biotinylated or
anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (1:250; Vector
Laboratories Inc.). Slides were washed, incubated with the
vectastain avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories
Inc.) for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed again, and
stained using peroxidase substrate kit diaminobenzidine
(Vector Laboratories Inc.). Finally, slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared with citrosolv, and
mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA).

Pathological Analysis of Nerve-Associated Tumors

H&E-stained tissue sections were evaluated for degree of
cellularity, nuclear atypia, necrosis, hemorrhage, and myx-
oid background, on the basis of a scale of none, low, me-
dium, or high for each phenotype. Slides immunostained for
the proliferative marker Ki-67 were evaluated and graded on
the scale of none, low, medium, or high with a subgrading
of 0 to 3. Neuroﬁbromas tend to have none to low-grade
1 Ki-67 staining, whereas grade 3 PNSTs had more prolif-
erating cells and a medium- to high-grade 2 to 3 Ki-67
staining index. In addition, mitotic ﬁgures were counted on
the basis of the H&E stain for one tissue section per tumor.
Also, tumors were assessed for the presence of mast cells by
toluidine blue staining and scored on the basis of presence
or absence of mast cells. S100b IHC was evaluated for
negative, focal, or diffuse staining pattern.

Generation of Cell Lines





Large nerve-associated tumors were carefully dissected using
aseptic techniques. The tumor was sliced into small pieces,
then placed into 1 DMEM containing 2 mg/mL collagenase
A. This solution was incubated at 37
C in 5% CO2 for 3 hours
to allow dissociation of cells from the bulk tumor. Before
plating, the solution was triturated and placed through a
33-mm ﬁlter. Cells were plated on 10-cm dishes containing
complete media (1 DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and
1 penicillin/streptomycin) and grown at 37
C in 5% CO2.
These cell strains were transduced with a lentivirus contain-
ing an enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (eGFP) and lucif-
erase reporter transgene. Successfully transduced cells, as
assessed by eGFP expression, were cell sorted using FACS-
þ
Aria (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The top 5% eGFP
cells were collected into 96-well plates.

clones that grew from the cell sort were assessed by

Cambridge, MA) to demonstrate Schwann cell origin and
expression of human EGFR.

Trp53 LOH Analysis

The analysis was performed as previously described.67 Brieﬂy,
genomic DNA isolated from tumor cell lines underwent PCR

ampliﬁcation for exon 8 of Trp53. Puriﬁed PCR products un-
derwent a restriction enzyme digest with Msl1. The Trp53R270H
allele possesses an Msl1 recognition sequence in exon 8, not
observed in the WT allele. When separated on a 2% agarose gel,
three products may be present after restriction endonuclease
digest: a higher-molecular-weight band (WT allele) and two
lower-molecular-weight bands (the digested Trp53R270H allele).

Cytogenetic Analysis

þ/ 

Spectral karyotyping analysis (SKY) was performed by the
University of Minnesota (Minneapolis) Cytogenetics core.
SKY was performed on early-passage cell lines (three to
seven passages) derived from Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
mouse
tumors. Cells were treated for 3.25 hours with colcemid, then
harvested according to standard cytogenetic protocols.
Eleven metaphases were analyzed by G-banding. An addi-
tional eight metaphase cells were examined by multicolor
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization with spectral karyotyping.
The G-banding and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization results
were integrated for ﬁnal karyotype interpretation. For array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), mouse tumor
DNA was restriction digested and labeled with ﬂuorochrome
cyanine-5 using random primers and exo-Klenow fragment
DNA polymerase. Control tail DNA from the same mouse
was labeled concurrently in cyanine-3. The sample and
control DNAs were combined, and aCGH was performed
with a microarray constructed by Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
that contains approximately 170,000 distinct biological oli-
gonucleotides spaced at an average interval of 10.9 kb. The
ratio of sample/control DNA for each oligo was calculated
using Feature Extraction software version 10.5 (Agilent
Technologies, Inc.). The abnormal threshold was applied
using Genomics Workbench version 7.0 (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Inc.). A combination of several statistical algorithms
was applied. A minimum of three oligos that have a minimum
absolute ratio value of 0.1 [on the basis of a log(2) ratio] is
required for reporting of a copy number loss or gain.

Allografts
Cultured cells were trypsinized, resuspended at 1  106 in
1 PBS, and injected s.c. into severe combined immuno-
deﬁciency (SCID)/BIEGE mice. After 1 month of growth or
when tumors reached 10% of body weight, tumors were
harvested, and wet weights were taken and then ﬁxed in

human aCGH, human microarray expression, methylome
data, and a TMA (Figure 1, AeC). Data sets are generated
from independent analysis of nonoverlapping, unique
human patient samples. By using aCGH data (GSE33881),
we identiﬁed EGFR gene CNA gains in approximately
37% of samples (19 of 51 patients) and TP53 CNA losses
in approximately 29% of samples (15 of 51 patients)
(Figure 1A).59 EGFR CNA gains tend to occur in the context

of near complete ampliﬁcation of the entire chromosome 7,
whereas TP53 CNA losses tend to coincide with loss of
chromosome arm 17p. Of 51 patients, 5 had co-occurring
EGFR gene CNA gains and TP53 gene CNA losses [odds
ratio with 95% CI of 39.92298, Fisher’s exact test (FET)
P Z 3.53924  10
 6]. To determine whether the CNAs
observed reﬂect alterations in gene expression, we analyzed
methylome, microarray expression, and TMA data.

Promoter CpG-IS methylation status is predictive of gene
expression: hypermethylation is associated with gene si-
lencing, and hypomethylation is associated with gene ex-
pression. MPNST whole-methylome data (GSE21714, n Z
10 MPNST samples) were analyzed for methylation of the
promoter CpG-IS regions for EGFR and TP53.56 No signiﬁ-
cant alterations in promoter CpG-IS methylation of EGFR and
TP53 genes in human MPNSTs were identiﬁed compared
with normal human Schwann cells (data not shown).

Previously reported microarray expression data analysis
on puriﬁed Schwann cells and bulk tumors for nerves,
neuroﬁbromas, and MPNSTs were used to assess EGFR and
TP53 mRNA levels (GSE14038). The microarray expression
data are similar to previous reports of a signiﬁcant increase in
EGFR mRNA levels in MPNST formation compared with
neuroﬁbromas (P Z 0.0002 for puriﬁed Schwann cells,
P < 0.0001 for bulk tumors, Student’s t-test), whereas TP53
mRNA levels were not signiﬁcantly altered in tumor pro-
gression from neuroﬁbromas (Figure 1B).68 Of 13 MPNST
cell lines, 3 had a 0.75-fold or greater reduction in TP53
expression and a threefold increase or greater in EGFR
mRNA expression, whereas nearly all bulk tumor samples
(including neuroﬁbromas) possessed co-alterations in TP53
and EGFR mRNA expression (Figure 1B). This discrepancy
may reﬂect alterations in additional cellular components,
such as mast cells, macrophages, ﬁbroblasts, axons, and
endothelial cells, within the bulk tumor.

To determine whether alterations in mRNA expression
reﬂect protein expression, dual immunoﬂuorescent staining
for EGFR and TP53 was performed on a human TMA con-
taining dermal neuroﬁbromas (n Z 30), plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas (n Z 31), and MPNSTs (n Z 32) (Figure 1C). All
tumors stained positive with varying intensities for TP53
expression, whereas EGFR expression was observed in only
50% of MPNSTs. Figure 1C shows representative images of
the 32 MPNST samples assessed. In some cases, EGFR
expression, when present, was not uniform throughout the

tumor but occurred in focal regions. TP53 expression was
variegated throughout the tumors, with rare TP53-negative
cells (Figure 1C).

To determine if alterations in EGFR and TP53 coexist in
other cancer types, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) database for several cancer types.69 EGFR and
TP53 alterations (mutations, CNAs, and microarray ex-
pression) had a tendency for co-occurrence in bladder uro-
thelial carcinoma (FET P Z 0.44), acute myeloid leukemia
(FET P Z 0.22),
lung squamous cell carcinoma (FET
P Z 0.113), lung adenocarcinoma (FET P Z 0.015), sar-
coma (FET P Z 0.052), and breast cancer (FET P Z
0.000003) data sets. Glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian se-
rous cystadenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, skin
cutaneous melanoma, colon and rectum adenocarcinoma,
uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, stomach adenocar-
cinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma had no
association or tendency for mutual exclusivity (Table 1).
Collectively, the data suggest that EGFR and TP53 alter-
ations occur in a subset of human MPNSTs and other
cancers, supporting a cooperative interaction.

EGFR Overexpression and Reduced TP53 Expression
Cooperate to Increase Proliferation and Anchorage-
Independent Growth in Vitro

To assess the cooperativity of EGFR and TP53 expression
for cellular transformation, overexpression of the full-length
EGFR cDNA and shRNA-targeted knockdown of TP53
were performed in iHSC1l cells either alone or in combi-
nation (dual) (Supplemental Figure S1A).70 A luciferase
cDNA served as a control. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-
qPCR) and Western blot analysis demonstrated that EGFR
overexpression and the shTP53 constructs
functioned
properly (Figure 2, A and C). Analysis of protein expression
indicates a signiﬁcant increase in EGFR (P < 0.05) and an
approximately 25% reduction in TP53 expression in the

However, clones that had complete loss of TP53 protein
formed signiﬁcantly fewer colonies compared with the con-
trol. Interestingly, regardless of EGFR or TP53 status, the
colony sizes were not signiﬁcantly altered (Supplemental
Figure S1, C and E). Collectively, these data demonstrate
that increased EGFR expression and reduced/altered TP53
expression cooperate to increase oncogenic properties of
immortalized human Schwann cells in vitro, but that com-
plete loss of p53 protein may not do so. These data also
suggest that additional changes are necessary to fully trans-
form cells.

tionally, dual EGFR overexpression and reduced TP53
expression signiﬁcantly enhanced proliferation by MTS cell
viability assay and anchorage-independent growth (two-
tailed t-test P < 0.0001) by a soft agar colony formation
assay compared with the single transgene controls (Figure 2,
B and C). To validate these ﬁndings, mutations into the
TP53 locus were introduced into EGFR-overexpressing
iHSC1l cells via TALENs. TALENs targeting the inert
HPRT locus served as a control. Single-cell clones were
selected and analyzed for mutations at the TP53 locus by
sequencing. Sequencing results identiﬁed mutations that
caused complete knockout (KO) of TP53 and complex
mutations in which each allele possessed different muta-
tions [called mutation detected (MD)] (Figure 2D and
Supplemental Figure S1D). Western blot analysis revealed
that clones with complex mutations had increased TP53
protein, but the molecular weight of the band was shifted
downward, suggesting the presence of a mutated protein
(Figure 2D). The KO clone displayed no protein product.
Individual clones were seeded in soft agar colony formation
assays to assess anchorage-independent growth capacity.
Clones containing complex mutations (MD) developed
signiﬁcantly more colonies than the controls (Figure 2D).

(Figure 3B). Nerve-associated tumors were histologically
evaluated for cellularity, nuclear atypia, necrosis, hemor-
rhage, myxoid background, and tumor border on the basis of
H&E staining (Figure 3C and Supplemental Table S1). H&E
staining identiﬁed features found in neuroﬁbromas (low-
medium cellularity, no-medium nuclear atypia, no necrosis,
no hemorrhage, low-medium myxoid background, and no
mitotic ﬁgures) and grade 3 PNSTs (MPNSTs in humans,
high cellularity, high nuclear atypia, some necrosis, rare
hemorrhage, and presence of mitotic ﬁgures) (Supplemental
Table S1). Toluidine blue staining identiﬁed the presence of
mast cells, which are often associated with neuroﬁbroma and
grade 3 PNSTs (Figure 3C). IHC for Schwann cell markers
S100b, Gfap, Nestin, Olig2, and Sox10 conﬁrmed that the
nerve-associated tumors were derived from the Schwann cell
lineage (Figure 3, C and D, and Supplemental Figure S2D).
To determine whether mice developed true neuroﬁbromas
versus microMPNSTs, we IHC evaluated tumors for the
presence of axons (neuronal nuclei), ﬁbroblasts (vimentin), and

ysis demonstrated the presence of additional cell

proliferating cells in grade 3 PNSTs (medium grade 2 to high
grade 3) (Supplemental Table S1). The proliferative index of
the nerve-associated tissues (normal nerve, nerve hyperplasia,
neuroﬁbromas, grade 2 PNSTs, and grade 3 PNSTs) was
assessed by counting mitotic ﬁgures on the basis of H&E
staining (Supplemental Figure S2B). Only grade 3 PNSTs
displayed mitotic ﬁgures by H&E staining, with an average of
approximately two mitotic ﬁgures per ﬁeld (Student’s t-test
P Z 0.0052). Collectively, the histological data suggest that the
nerve-associated tumors represent various grades of human
Schwann cell tumor formation: nerve hyperplasia, neuroﬁ-
broma, grade 2 PNSTs, and grade 3 PNSTs. Neuroﬁbromas
were predominantly observed in the paraspinal dorsal root
ganglion, whereas grade 3 PNSTs were observed more
frequently in all other peripheral nerves. In addition, 40% (n Z
11 of 27 analyzed) of grade 3 PNSTs contained rare regions of
additional cellular phenotypes (epithelioid-like cells, matrix-
producing cells, and wreath-like giant cells) observed in some
human MPNSTs (Supplemental Figure S2C).71,72 Collectively,
these data suggest that the nerve-associated tumors resemble
human neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs.

þ/ 

þ/ 

Because Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
mice only had a 33% pene-
trance of grade 3 PNST formation, additional genetic al-
terations must be required for the tumors to develop. LOH
analysis of the Trp53 gene identiﬁed that 40% of grade 3
PNSTs lost
the WT Trp53 allele (data not shown). To
identify additional genetic events leading to tumor formation,
we performed aCGH on seven Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
grade 3
PNSTs. The tumors contained a variety of chromosomal al-
terations, including whole chromosome gains and losses and
regional gains and losses (Figure 5 and Supplemental Table
S2). Whole chromosome gains occurred on chromosomes 3,
5, and 15 in four of seven mice. Three of seven grade 3
PNSTs showed whole chromosome losses on chromosomes
10 and 18. To identify candidate MPNST-driver genes, we
analyzed genes found on focal chromosomal gains/losses
and included tumors that also possessed whole chromosomal
gains/losses that contained the focal regions of interest
(Figure 5). We only assessed CNAs observed in four or more
mouse tumors (Table 2). This narrowed the search down to
ﬁve regions containing 2452 genes: CNAs on chromosomes
4, 15, and 18. We identiﬁed the human orthologs for the list

compared with single transgenic mice (Figure 3E). Tumor
penetrance for each genotype is summarized in Supplemental
Table S2. Interestingly, we observed a 15% penetrance of
neuroﬁbroma formation on the Cnp-EGFR background
compared with previous reports of nerve hyperplasia with
5% neuroﬁbroma formation.49 Discrepancies in these ob-
servations may be due, in part, to differences in mouse
strain. Our mouse model was generated by backcrossing the
Cnp-EGFR transgene from a C57BL/6 background to an
FVB/N background (ﬁve to seven generations). Previous
reports used C57BL/6-SJL mice with backcross onto
C57BL/6. FVB/N mice are more susceptible to tumor for-
mation than C57BL/6 in the context of GEMMs for tumor
formation, most likely attributed to differences in genetic
modiﬁers (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME).

To determine whether the downstream signaling pathways
þ/ 
of EGFR and Trp53 were altered in the Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
mouse tumors, histological analysis of downstream signaling
pathways of EGFR (pEGFR, pErk, and pAkt) and Trp53 (p21
expression) were assessed in neuroﬁbromas (n Z 6 mice) and
grade 3 PNSTs (n Z 13 mice) (Figure 4A and Supplemental
Figure S2D). EGFR, pEGFR, pErk, Trp53, and p21 were
present in both neuroﬁbromas and grade 3 PNSTs, with more
intense EGFR, pEGFR, and pErk staining observed in grade 3
PNSTs. pAkt was absent in neuroﬁbromas, and variable
expression was observed in grade 3 PNSTs (Student’s t-test
P < 0.0001) (Figure 4B). These data support the previous

of candidate MPNST-driver genes and assessed the CNA
status on 51 human MPNST tumor samples. Comparative
analysis to human CNA data identiﬁed 199 of 2452 genes
with recurrent CNAs in human MPNSTs (Supplemental
Table S3).

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems Inc.,
Redwood City, CA) of the 199 genes with recurrently
occurring CNAs in mouse and human MPNSTs identiﬁed
eight signaling pathways signiﬁcantly enriched: ERK5
signaling, ephrin receptor
signaling, phospholipase C
signaling, axonal guidance signaling, tec kinase signaling,
ephrin A signaling, polyamine regulation in colon cancer,
and P2Y purinergic receptor signaling pathway (Table 3). In
addition, there was signiﬁcant enrichment in genes found in
normal cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and
DNA replication, recombination, and repair (Supplemental
Table S4). Moreover, 56 genes identiﬁed are implicated in
cancer, including four with recurrent CNA gains (PRUNE,
PTK2, NTRK1, and MYC ) previously implicated in MPNST
development (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4).74e77 These
data suggest that EGFR overexpression and reduced Trp53
expression cooperate to generate an environment permissible
for gross chromosomal alterations that enrich for protu-
morigenic signaling pathways for MPNST formation to
occur in Schwann cells in vivo.

Characterization of Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
PNST-Derived Cell Lines

þ/ 

Grade 3

To identify additional mutations and to corroborate the
aCGH ﬁnding, G-banding and SKY analysis were performed

on single-cell clones from three early-passage (three to seven
passages) grade 3 PNSTs that express Schwann cell markers
(Olig2 and S100b) (data not shown). Cell clones were
analyzed for cytogenetic abnormalities (G-banding and
SKY), LOH of WT Trp53 allele, and allograft tumor for-
mation. G-banding and SKY analysis from 15 and 13 cell
clones, respectively, from two tumors identiﬁed variable
karyotypes, including whole chromosomal gains, losses, and
translocations (Figure 6, A and B). Recurrent whole chro-
mosomal gains were observed on chromosomes 4 (27 of 28),
6 (26 of 28), 8 (27 of 28), and 15 (28 of 28). The high level of
aneuploidy observed in these cell lines is similar to the
incidence observed in human MPNSTs. Interestingly, 80%
of the tumor-derived cell lines analyzed underwent LOH for
the WT Trp53 allele within the ﬁrst three passages after
single-cell sorting, suggesting there is a selective pressure for
the loss of the WT Trp53 allele in vivo and/or in cell culture
(Figure 6C). Last, clones were injected into SCID/BIEGE
mice for allograft
tumor formation assays to determine
whether they retain properties similar to the parental tumors
(Figure 6D). Histological analysis of tumors (H&E, toluidine
blue, Ki-67, and S100b) indicated that the clones produced
tumors with features of grade 3 PNSTs: spindle-shaped cell
morphological characteristics, mast cell
inﬁltration, high
proliferative index, and expression of a Schwann cell marker,
S100b (Figure 6D). Collectively, these data suggest that
EGFR overexpression and loss of Trp53 expression alone are
not sufﬁcient for MPNST formation but facilitate chromo-
somal aberrations that lead to MPNST formation.

Discussion

We performed a comprehensive analysis of EGFR and TP53
cooperativity in human and mouse MPNST development.
We identiﬁed co-occurring alterations of the EGFR and TP53
genes by CNAs, microarray expression, and dual immuno-
ﬂuorescent staining in human MPNSTs. Modulation of
EGFR and TP53 expression in iHSCs in vitro increased
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Transgenic
mice overexpressing EGFR and haploinsufﬁcient for Trp53
formed all grades of Schwann cell tumors. Last, cytogenetic
analysis of grade 3 PNSTs from EGFR-overexpressing
and TP53-haploinsufﬁcient mice developed chromosomal
aberrations that enriched for genes in the ERK5 signaling
cascade.

Ampliﬁcation of the EGFR gene and mutations and/or
deletions of the TP53 locus are common events in human
MPNST.25,46,78,79 However, there has not been a large-scale
study correlating the expression of both events. Tabone-
Eglinger et al47 performed a large-scale IHC analysis of
EGFR expression on 52 MPNST samples (NF1 syndrome
associated and sporadic) and observed that 86% of the
samples overexpressed EGFR. From the 52 samples, they
assessed four for co-expression of TP53 and identiﬁed half
of the samples overexpressing EGFR to be associated with

tensity of staining, whereas only 50% of samples expressed
EGFR. This discrepancy with previous reports may be the
result of many factors, including sample size and method.
Also, immunoﬂuorescence/IHC will not identify mutations
in TP53 that may produce a mutant protein product. In
addition, we analyzed DNA CNA data for the EGFR and
TP53 loci in human MPNSTs and identiﬁed a subset of
patients with co-occurring EGFR CNA gains and TP53
CNA losses (5 of 51 patients). Assessment of several cancer
types in TCGA identiﬁed a signiﬁcant co-occurrence of
EGFR and TP53 aberrations (mRNA expression, CNAs,
and mutations) in breast cancer and sarcomas (Table 1).
Collectively, the data suggest that EGFR overexpression
and reduced/impaired TP53 expression may cooperate for
tumor formation in a subset of human cancers.

The reasons for this strong cooperation between EGFR
overexpression and Trp53 haploinsufﬁciency in vivo are un-
clear. Some possible reasons for the cooperation include, but
are not limited, to the following: Trp53 haploinsufﬁciency
alleviates EGFR-induced senescence. Trp53 haploinsufﬁ-
ciency impairs DNA repair mechanisms, allowing for
acquisition of rare oncogenic mutations that cooperate with
EGFR overexpression. It seems possible that overexpressing
EGFR activates TP53, thereby limiting cell proliferation,
perhaps by up-regulating CDKN1A. Senescence is triggered
by the activation of signaling pathways, such as TP53 and
CDKN2A.80 TP53 loss of function and EGFR activation co-
occur in other cell types, such as in human esophageal cancer,
where there is a correlation between EGFR overexpression
and TP53 loss of function.52,81,82 Okawa et al51 demonstrated

Table 3

Signaling Pathway Analysis of aCGH Focal Gain Regions

that overexpression of EGFR, activation of
telomerase
reverse transcriptase, and reduction in TP53 expression were
capable of transforming esophageal epithelial cells. Ohashi
et al83 demonstrated that overexpression of EGFR in
immortalized esophageal epithelial cells induced expression
of cell cycle kinase inhibitors p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p21.
This senescent state was alleviated partially by introducing a
mutant TP53, leading to increased transformation of the
immortalized esophageal cells. It is possible that, in our
mouse model, EGFR overexpression induces an oncogenic
senescence that
is partially alleviated by Trp53 hap-
loinsufﬁciency, allowing for acquisition of additional muta-
tions for grade 3 PNST formation. Because only 33% of mice
developed grade 3 PNSTs, clearly additional mutations and/
or genetic alterations are required for high-grade tumor
formation.

In addition to the role TP53 has in cell cycle progression
and its transcriptional activity, TP53 has a pivotal role in
DNA repair mechanisms that prevent acquisition of genome
mutations. Loss of Trp53 expression reduces the activity of
DNA repair pathway mechanisms (base/nucleotide excision
repair) that
leads to the accumulation of mutations that
generate genomic instability that often results in chromo-
somal aberrations (aneuploidy).84 This study focused on
gross chromosomal alterations by cytogenetic analysis of
grade 3 PNSTs and tumor-derived cell lines. The aCGH,
SKY, and G-banding data demonstrated an aneuploidy
phenotype in both the bulk tumors and tumor-derived cell
lines, which is similar to that observed in human MPNST
bulk tumors and cell lines.22 To identify potential signaling
pathways that cooperate with EGFR overexpression and
Trp53 haploinsufﬁciency for grade 3 PNST formation, we

signaling pathways (Table 3 and Supplemental Table S5).
The top pathway, ERK5 signaling or BMK1, is an atypical
MAPK signaling pathway that promotes cellular prolifera-
tion (activation of c-Jun, SAP, and MYC) and inhibits
apoptosis by phosphorylating BAD and Foxo3A.85,86 Pre-
vious studies on ERK signaling in human MPNST cell lines
indicate that ERK5 signaling is active and induced in the
presence of EGF ligand.87 Our mouse model suggests that
additional studies on ERK5/BMK1 signaling in MPNST
development are warranted and may provide a potential
therapeutic target for treatment of MPNSTs.

þ/ 

Activation of several signaling pathways known to be
involved in MPNST development was also observed in our
mouse model. Increased signaling through EGFR, via pAkt,
was observed in Cnp-EGFR;Trp53
grade 3 PNSTs. These
data corroborate previous reports indicating that pAkt and
downstream signaling through the mTOR pathway are
important in MPNST.12e14,70,73 Similar to our GEMM, NPcis
tumors and tumor-derived cell lines have activated the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway and increased EGFR expression
(Figure 6C).88 Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in
NPcis cell lines potently inhibited EGF-dependent growth.88
In addition, TP53 loss is known to induce growth factor
expression, such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor
(HB-EGF).89 HB-EGF binds to EGFR and induces signaling
through the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway. Cell lines from

the NPcis mouse express HB-EGF.88 Our grade 3 PNST-
derived cell lines also express HB-EGF, which may be an
additional mechanism for activating the PI3K/Akt pathway in
our mouse model (Figure 6E). Potentially in our model, Trp53
haploinsufﬁciency removes a senescent brake on Schwann
cell transformation, while also causing growth factor ex-
pression to stimulate proliferation in an autocrine manner.

Recently, aCGH was performed on 11 early-passage,
grade 3 PNST cell strains from the P0-GGFb3 transgenic
mouse overexpressing neuregulin in the Schwann cells.74
Neuregulin is a growth factor ligand, implicated in many
human cancers, including MPNSTs, that binds to and stim-
ulates signaling through erbB receptors.17 Transgenic mice
overexpressing neuregulin in Schwann cells develop both
neuroﬁbromas and frank MPNSTs. In our study, chromo-
somal CNAs, including whole chromosome gains of chro-
mosomes 3, 5, 15, and 18, were identiﬁed in four of seven
tumors. Interestingly, Kazmi et al74 reported whole chro-
mosomal losses for chromosome 4, and no alterations were
observed on chromosome 5. This discrepancy in CNAs may
reﬂect differences in mouse strain background and/or acti-
vation of erbB2 and erbB3 receptor signaling pathways
by neuregulin and not solely EGFR (erbB1), as in our model.
Recently, Brosius et al90 demonstrated that neuregulin
overexpression alone was not sufﬁcient to generate MPNSTs
on a C57BL/6J mouse strain. However, when combined
with Trp53 haploinsufﬁciency, P0-GGFb3 transgenic mice
developed de novo MPNSTs. Interestingly, our study and
Brosius et al90 identiﬁed a similar CNA gain on chromosome
15 in a region containing MYC. Moreover, MYC expression
is elevated in human MPNSTs compared with neuroﬁbromas
and is directly altered by modulating components of the Wnt/
b-catenin pathway.91 Collectively,
the data sets support
previous reports that MYC is a strong genetic driver of
MPNST formation.

In summary, we determined that co-alteration of EGFR
and TP53 expression in vitro and in vivo contribute to
Schwann cell tumorigenesis through increased proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, PI3K/Akt pathway activa-
tion, and chromosomal alterations enriching for alterations
in genes in the ERK5 signaling pathway.
