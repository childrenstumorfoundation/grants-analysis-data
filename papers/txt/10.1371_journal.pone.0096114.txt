Abstract

The advent of Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), and similar technologies such as CRISPR, provide a
straightforward and cost effective option for targeted gene knockout (KO). Yet, there is still a need for methods that allow
for enrichment and isolation of modified cells for genetic studies and therapeutics based on gene modified human cells. We
have developed and validated two methods for simple enrichment and isolation of single or multiplex gene KO’s in
transformed, immortalized, and human progenitor cells. These methods rely on selection of a phenotypic change such as
resistance to a particular drug or ability to grow in a selective environment. The first method, termed co-transposition,
utilizes integration of a piggyBac transposon vector encoding a drug resistance gene. The second method, termed co-
targeting, utilizes TALENs to KO any gene that when lost induces a selectable phenotype. Using these methods we also
show removal of entire genes and demonstrate that TALENs function in human CD34+ progenitor cells. Further, co-
transposition can be used to generate conditional KO cell lines utilizing an inducible cDNA rescue transposon vector. These
methods allow for robust enrichment and isolation of KO cells in a rapid and efficient manner.

Introduction

Reverse genetic approaches in human cells have proven fruitful
for understanding conditions such as cancer and neurodegener-
ative diseases. However, even with the multiple forms of mRNA
knock down (KD) available, such as small hairpin RNA (shRNA),
small interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNAs (miRNA) there
are still not simple and reliable methods to completely knockout
(KO) gene function to eliminate all protein expression, as is
observed in many human cancers. Moreover, shRNA technologies
vary in efficacy among cell lines, can be silenced by the host cell,
and need to be maintained under drug selection to ensure
continued target knockdown, a drawback that critically impairs in
vivo xenograph studies. Thus, it may be necessary to mutate and
inactivate, or completely remove, an endogenous loci to ablate
protein levels to model diseases where complete loss of gene
function is observed. Moreover, as new candidate cancer genes are
being rapidly identified by whole genome sequencing efforts and
forward genetic screens it is important that robust methods to

completely KO gene function become more accessible and
efficient to study these genes functionally [1–5]. This is also true
of gene therapy studies to model or treat genetic diseases, where
eliminating endogenous gene expression is critical,
such as
targeting CCR5 in T-cell progenitors for HIV treatment [6].

The recent advent of TALENs, and similar targeted nucleases
such as the CRISPR system, offer a reliable and cost effective
avenue for targeted gene KO for genetic studies and therapies
conceivably obtainable for any lab[7–9]. Though many labs may
not have the expertise in nuclease design or implementation to
consistently achieve high rates of modification for their gene of
interest (GOI). This combined with the fact that numerous clones
must be isolated and analyzed to identify KO clones demonstrates
that simple enrichment and isolation methods are needed in order
to expand the use of designer nucleases to generate KO cell lines
for research. Moreover,
isolation of nuclease modified cells
intended for therapeutic applications could also be improved by
the use of enrichment methods. However, nearly 4 years after the

isolating KO cell

There have been a limited number of articles demonstrating
enrichment of nuclease modified cells, these methods typically rely
on fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a surrogate
nuclease reporter plasmid or having the nucleases linked physically
or transcriptionally to a fluorescent protein in some manner
[11,12]. Unfortunately, cells that have undergone FACS are
exposed to intense lasers and high hydrostatic pressure, reducing
their viability, in addition to the need for a FACS machine[13].
Further, the use of a surrogate nuclease reporter plasmid requires
the construction of a new reporter vector for every intended
nuclease target site. Importantly, these methods do not allow for
selection of enriched cells
for
analysis. This is a large impediment for functional studies of gene
loss in cancer studies using transformed cell lines.

to generate individual clones

An ideal method for enrichment and isolation of nuclease
modified cells would be one that functions in nearly all cell types,
uses a universal construct, relies on a simple and effective
phenotypic selection to easily generate clones, and consistently
increase the frequency of generating nuclease modified clones to
expedite identification of KO clones. To this end, we developed
and validated simple and efficient,
for
enrichment and isolation of KO mammalian cells. These methods
rely on selection of a phenotypic change such as resistance to a
particular drug or ability to grow in a selective environment, such
as soft agar.

single step methods

The first method, termed co-transposition, uses co-transfection
of TALENs with a Piggybac (PB)
transposon carrying a drug
selectable marker to allow for enrichment and isolation of TALEN
modified cells for genetic studies[14]. We validated this method
using 12 different TALEN pairs targeting tumor suppressor genes,
proto-oncogenes, and seemingly inert genes with increased gene
modification compared to unselected TALEN treated cells
observed in nearly all cases. The second method, termed co-
targeting, uses TALENs to target a gene that allows for phenotypic
selection of modified cells. We demonstrate two unique selectable
phenotypes. Targeting the tumor suppressor PTEN in immortal-
ized human Schwann cells induces anchorage independent growth
in soft agar, which allows for simple isolation of cells successfully
targeted for KO of PTEN and other GOI co-targeted with
TALENs. Lastly, in an effort to increase gene modification for cells
potentially intended for therapeutic purposes, we successfully
implement co-targeting of HPRT using CD34
human cord blood
therapeutically
progenitor cells to enrich for modification of
relevant genes. Our results demonstrate that
the use of co-
transposition and co-targeting allows for rapid generation of
TALEN modified cells for research and therapeutic applications.

Materials and Methods

Vector design and assembly

Candidate TALENs were designed using TALE-NT (https://
boglab.plp.iastate.edu/node/add/talen) or using previously de-
scribed and validated target sites (Table S1)[15]. From the list of
candidate TALENs generated using TALE-NT, optimal TALENs
were chosen and constructed based on RVD content, spacer
length, and binding site length based on previous TALEN
publications and our own experiences with TALENs[8,9,16,17].
Briefly, stretches of NG/NI RVDs were avoided, high HD
content, spacer and binding site length ranging from 15–18;
though we have developed functional TALENs that go against
these general parameters. TALENs were assembled using Golden

Gate cloning as previously described[18]. The truncated D152+63
TALEN backbone and ‘cold’shock’ method used have been
previously described[8,19,20]. The piggyBac
transposon PB-
CAGG-Luciferase-IRES-GFP-PGK-Puro was generated by LR
clonase reaction (Invitrogen) of pENTR221-Luciferase with PB-
CAG-DEST1-IRES-GFP-PGK-Puro as previously described[21].

The conditional
recombinase retrofitting of R26 (-) TRE-DEST1 with PB-EF1A-
rtTA-IRES-Puro as previously described[22]. TALEN resistant
cDNAs (TR-cDNAs) were generated by performing inverse PCR
of pENTR221-cDNA vectors
engineering silent nucleotide
changes in both forward and reverse PCR primers. TR-cDNAs
were then transferred to PB-TRE-DEST1-EF1A-rtTA-IRES-Puro
by standard LR Clonase reaction (Invitrogen). The PB-mCAG-
DHFR:EGFP transposon plasmid was constructed from the
previously described DL2G plasmid[23]. The entire transposon
cassette,
including mCAGs, DHFR(tyr22)-eGFP, and bovine
growth hormone polyA was removed using XhoI to NheI sites
and inserted into analogous sites of PB-MCS (LR5). The CRISPR
system was obtained from Addgene[7]. The hCas9 cDNA was
PCR amplified and cloned into pENTR1 Gateway vector using
SnaBI and XbaI engineered into the PCR primers. An N-terminal
Flag tag sequence was also included in the forward primer. The
Flag-hCas9 cDNA was then moved to PT3.5-CAGG-DEST using
the LR Clonase reaction (Invitrogen). U6-gRNA vectors were
produced using inverse PCR of TOPO4-U6-gRNA vector with
unique 19 bp target sequences engineered into the forward primer
and a common reverse primer, followed by T4 polynucleotide
kinase treatment (New England Biolabs) and self-ligation with T4
Ligase (New England Biolabs). Primer sequences can be found in
Table S2.

Cell culture, drug selection, and electroporations

All cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. HCT116 cells
were purchased from ATCC. 2462-TY and immortalized human
Schwann cells have been previously described[21]. All TALEN
transfected cells, unless noted otherwise, underwent ‘cold shock’
for 2 days at 30uC after 1 day at 37uC to increase the frequency of
gene modification. Electroporations were performed using the
NEON electroporation system (Invitrogen) using 100 mL electro-
poration tips, following manufacturers instructions. One million
cells were electroporated with 2 mg of each left and right TALEN
vector or 2 mg Flag-hCas9 and U6-gRNA vector with 100 ng of
pmaxGFP plasmid (Amaxa) to assess transfection efficiency. Co-
transposition was performed using an additional 500 ng of PB
transposon and 500 ng of CMV-PB7 transposase.

CEL-I assay and analysis

CEL-I assays were performed as previously descried[24].
Briefly, after electroporation of TALEN encoding plasmids and
incubation for 3 days genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following manufacturers instruc-
tions. PCR amplicons were generated spanning the TALEN
binding site using Accuprime Taq HF (Invitrogen) using the
following PCR cycle: initial denaturation at 95uC for 5 min; 406
(95uC for 30 sec, 55uC or 60uC for 30 sec, 68uC for 40 sec); final
extension at 68uC for 2 min. PCR amplicons were denatures and
annealed as follows: 95uC for 5 minutes, 95–85uC at 22uC/s, 85–
25uC at 20.1uC/s, 4uC hold. Primer sequences can be found in
Table S2. Three microliters of the annealed amplicon was then
diluted with 6 mL of 16 Accuprime PCR buffer and treated with
1 mL of Surveyor nuclease with 1 mL of enhancer (Transgenomics)
at 42uC for 20 min. The reaction was then stopped by the addition

containing 1 mM EDTA and subsequently run on a standard
10% TBE gel. Percent gene modification was calculated using
Image J software as described[24].

Western blot analysis

Cells were harvested and lysed with modified RIPA buffer
(0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA) containing phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and a
complete mini protease inhibitor pellet
(Roche). Cells were
incubated on ice for 10 min followed by sonication with 10 pulses
at 30% power. TP53 (2527), NF2 (6995), PTEN (9188), CCND1
(2978) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
AcV5 (A2980) antibody was purchased from Sigma.

Knockout sequence analysis

TALEN target site amplicons were amplified as in the CEL-I
protocol described above. Purified PCR products were directly
sequenced by single pass Sanger sequencing (ACGT, Inc and the
University of Minnesota Biomedical Genomics Center).

Proliferation and soft agar growth assays

Proliferation assays were set up in a 96-well format with 100
cells plated per well. Proliferation was assessed every 24 hours over
6 days by the MTS assay, following manufactures instructions
(Promega). Absorbance was
read at 490 nm to determine
proliferation and 650 nm to account for cellular debris on a
BioTek Synergy Mx automated plate reader. Soft agar assays were
performed as follows, 6-well plates were prepared with bottom
agar composed of 3.2% SeaPlaque Agar (Lonza) in DMEM full
media and allowed to solidify before 10,000 cells in top agar (0.8%
SeaPlaque Agar in DMEM full media) were plated and allowed to
solidify. DMEM full media with 2.5 mg/mL doxycycline was
plated over the cells and cells were incubated under standard
conditions (5% CO2,37uC) for 2 weeks. Top media was removed
and cells were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific) containing
0.005% crystal violet (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Formalin was removed and colonies were imaged on a Leica S8
AP0 microscope. 12 images per cell
line were taken and
automated colony counts were done using ImageJ software.

Co-transposition using Piggybac allows for enrichment
and isolation of TALEN modified clones

As it has been previously reported that cells expressing high
levels of nuclease protein produce more DSBs, we hypothesized
that a method that enriches for cells transfected with high levels of
TALEN encoding plasmid could enrich for TALEN modified
cells[12,20]. Additionally, it would be ideal to select for these cells
using a simple drug selection strategy. As piggyBac (PB) mediated
transposon transposition is a relatively inefficient process when
transposase expression is limited,
low levels of transposase
encoding plasmid, we hypothesized that co-transfection of
TALENs with limited PB transposase and PB transposon encoding
a drug selectable marker could allow for both enrichment and
isolation of TALEN modified cells (Figure 1a)[25]. We have
termed this method co-transposition as TALENs are co-transfect-
ed with the PB system that undergoes transposition.

i.e.

To test this hypothesis, we performed co-transposition using 12
independent TALEN pairs with a puromycin encoding PB
transposon into S462-TY malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor (MPNST) cells and allowed the cells to grow for 14 days
with or without drug selection (Figure 1b). Using the CEL-I assay
as a readout, all but one TALEN pair (TP53) demonstrated
increased gene modification with drug selection; with a fold
increase from day 3 to 14 ranging from 1.9–25.4 fold (,5 fold on
average) (Figure 1b). These experiments were performed using a
‘cold shock’ treatment at 30uC as we, and others, have found this
increases TALEN activity and subsequent gene modification
(Figure S1)[19]. Interestingly, using TALENs to known oncogenes
of WNT/Beta-catenin signaling (MYC and CTNNB1), recently
reported to be critical for MPNST cell maintenance, demonstrated
near undetectable levels of gene modification in MPNST cells
without co-transposition; though these TALENs were previously
validated in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and produced robust gene
modification by transient transfection (13% and 26% for MYC and
CTNNB1,
respectively)[26,27]. However, when MYC and
CTNNB1 were targeted with co-transposition gene modification
rates were much higher, demonstrating the power of selection of
this system even in a situation where a cell population relies on
expression of the target genes.

Next, we implemented co-transposition for cancer gene KO to
assess the ability of co-transposition to generate viable KO clones
and also determine a rate of TALEN modified clones. Puromycin
resistant clones were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR
products of TALEN target sites, which were then classified as wild
type (WT), mutation detected (MD), or double knockout (DKO)
clones (Figure S2). DKO clones contain identical or near identical
bi-allelic insertion or deletion (indels) mutations, where as MD
clones are mutated at one or more alleles with different indels. The
classification of MD was used in place of cloning and sequencing
different alleles as the copy number of target genes in transformed
cells is unknown and likely varies dramatically. Moreover, the

definitive test of Western blot analysis to determine loss of protein
expression should be performed on a panel of isolated MD and
DKO clones to identify clones for use in functional studies or
biochemical assays, which is substantially cheaper and faster than
cloning all alleles of every MD clone identified.

We identified clones of each classification with every TALEN
pair tested in both 2462-TY and HCT116 cells with only 14.6%
(n = 371) and 39.2% (n = 143) of clones
found to be WT,
respectively (Figure 1c and d). Though our transfection efficiencies
in these immortalized cell lines were consistently over 80%, co-
transposition also enriches for nuclease modified cells in poorly
transfectable cell lines (data not shown). Moreover, modified cells
appropriately expressed EGFP and luciferase, also encoded in the
puromycin containing transposon, demonstrating that co-transpo-
sition can be used to concurrently engineer modified cells to
express multiple heterologous genes (Figure S3). In fact, co-
transposition was effective with our recently described RecWay
assembled, multigene,
transposon vectors containing up to 6
transgenes and ,30 kb in size (Figure S4)[28]. Co-transposition

(Figure S5). These data demonstrate that co-transposition is a
robust method for enrichment and isolation of nuclease modified
cells and also allows for concurrent engineering of targeted cells to
express numerous heterologous genes, which can be easily
performed in less than 2 months (Figure 1e). Moreover, we found
that this method is not limited to TALENs but is also highly
efficient with the recently described CRISPR system, increasing
gene modification ,5 fold on average with rates ranging from
41.5–55.6% (Figure S6)[7]

Conditional rescue co-transposition for inducible KO cell
lines

lines of

target genes

When targeting oncogenes using co-transposition it was noted
that the number of DKO clones generated was consistently lower
compared to experiments where tumor suppressors genes or
seemingly inert genes, such as HPRT, were targeted (Figure 1c). It
is possible that cells where oncogenes were inactivated by TALEN
induced mutations were less viable and therefore rarely isolated.
Thus, we developed a conditional rescue system to generate
inducible KO cell
that are addictive
oncogenes or essential genes. We hypothesized that supplementing
cells continually with target gene expression via cDNA expression
could allow for the isolation of viable KO clones. This approach
uses an all-in-one doxycycline inducible transposon to express a
TALEN resistant cDNA (TR-cDNA) of the target gene in addition
to the puromycin resistance gene (Figure 2a). We found that
cDNAs can be made TR by introduction of silent mutations at the
TALEN target site in the cDNA. We further flanked the TRE-
cDNA portion of the vector with LoxP sites to allow for complete
removal of
the TR-cDNA in addition to being doxycycline
regulatable. In an effort to test the conditional rescue system we
targeted the recently described proto-oncogene FOXR2 by
removal of the entire gene[21].

To this end, we generated TALENs flanking the entire open
reading frame (ORF) of this single exon gene; one targeting just
after the ATG start codon and the other just after the stop codon
(Figure 2b). We identified numerous clones with heterozygous and

homozygous deletion of FOXR2 by PCR and direct sequencing
using 2462-TY cells, all of which demonstrated fusion of the 59
and 39 UTRs (Figure 2c,d). We were able to identify conditional
rescue DKO clones that dependably induced TR-FOXR2 cDNA
expression upon treatment with doxycycline by Western blot
analysis (Figure 2e). It is also known that loss of FOXR2 in MPNST
cells substantially reduces their ability to form colonies in soft
agar[21]. Importantly, this functional read out was significantly
induced upon treatment with doxycycline and nearly undetectable
in the absence of TR-FOXR2 induction (P,0.0001***, Two-tailed
t-test) (Figure 2f).

Co-transposition conditional rescue is not limited to deletion of
an entire gene or FOXR2 as we were able to generate DKO cell
lines carrying the corresponding inducible TR-cDNA transposon
for CCND1,
targeting just after the ATG start codon, and
demonstrate functional read-outs of significantly enhanced prolif-
eration and growth in soft agar upon activation of TR-CCND1
with doxycycline (P = 0.0211* and P = 0.0017**, respectively,
t-test) (Figure S7). Taken together, these data demonstrate that
co-transposition using a conditional rescue transposon vector is a
viable option for making conditional KO cell lines.

Anchorage independent growth induction using co-
targeting enriches for TALEN modified cells

Next, we wanted to develop a co-targeting method for
enrichment and isolation of TALEN modified clones that would
rely on a selectable phenotype. To this end, we utilized co-
targeting of genes using TALENs to induce anchorage indepen-
dent growth (Figure 3a). Using an immortalized human Schwann
cell line we implemented TALENs targeting PTEN, TP53, and
NF2 individually and in combination[21]. Interestingly, when
using individual TALENs only PTEN targeting significantly
induced colony formation compared to untargeted controls,
indicating that PTEN loss
is a strong driver of anchorage
independent growth in this cell type (Figure 3b)
(P = 0.0110*,
t-Test).

When all three TALEN pairs were multiplexed, 16.6% of
analyzed clones were DKO at all
three targets by direct
sequencing (Figure 3c). Moreover, upon Western blot analysis an
additional 20% were DKO for all targets at the protein level as
many MD clones were presumably KOs with different indels
(Figure 3d). DKO clones containing residual protein could be from
small in-frame indels that may or may not disable protein function.
Importantly,
single experiment we generated every
combination of gene mutation, i.e. heterozygous and homozygous
mutations,
from analyzing a small number of clones (n = 18).
These data demonstrate that co-targeting is a powerful method for
modeling de novo transformation and studying combinations of
gene mutations in immortalized human cells.

type, we performed HPRT co-
therapeutically relevant cell
targeting in CD34
cord blood progenitor cells that are routinely
used for hematopoietic stem cell
transplants. We chose co-
targeting over co-transposition to avoid the possibility of
insertional mutagenesis or
immune response to introduced
transgenes associated with PB co-transposition, though we did
find that PB transposition is functional in CD34
enriched cord
blood progenitors, albeit at low frequencies (.1% when normal-
ized to plating efficiency) (Figure S8).

As TALEN modification of CD34

enriched cord blood
progenitors has not been previously reported, we began by
targeting HPRT alone using nucleofection of TALEN encoding
plasmid DNA and colony forming assays
in methylcellulose
(Figure 4a). TALEN modification was undetectable 5 days after
transfection but after 2 weeks of selection in 6-TG pooled colonies
demonstrated 52% gene modification (Figure 4b). Next we
targeted CCR5 and found that gene modification was undetectable
at day 5, but increased to nearly 13% with HPRT co-targeting and
selection (Figure 4b). To assess the percentage of co-modified
progenitor clones using HPRT co-targeting, we analyzed individ-
ual 6-TG selected colonies by direct sequencing of HPRT and the
co-targeted gene ARTEMIS. Sequence analysis demonstrated that
30.8% (8/26) and 64.1% (25/39) of 6-TGR colonies were co-
modified in two independent cord blood samples (Figure 4c).
However, in a third experiment no 6-TGR colonies were obtained

upon co-targeting, even though targeting HPRT alone in this cord
produced a robust number of 6-TGR colonies. In fact,
the
generation of 6-TGR colonies was highly variable with HPRT
alone (2.2%62.9 CFU-GM and 2.1%62.1 erythroid) and co-
targeting (4.3%63.6 CFU-GM and 1.9%60.75 erythroid) from
individual cords (Figure 4d). However, these data demonstrates
that co-targeting HPRT is an effective method for enrichment of
enriched cord blood progenitors.

Discussion

We have presented two methods for enrichment and isolation of
nuclease modified cells based on co-transposition using the piggyBac
(PB)
transposon system and co-targeting using phenotypic
selection after targeted knock out of endogenous genes. Co-
transposition is a simple and efficient method for enrichment and
isolation of nuclease modified cells that will likely increase the ease
at which researchers can generate KO cell lines. Co-transposition
superior to previously reported enrichment and isolation
is
methods
that rely on fluorescence based surrogate nuclease
reporter plasmids or having the nucleases linked physically or
transcriptionally to a fluorescent protein in some manner[11,31].
Co-transposition does not require the use of a FACS machine,
which avoids exposing modified cells to high levels of hydrostatic
pressure and intense lasers, recently reported to reduce viability of
nuclease modified cells[13,31]. Another enrichment method that
has been recently reported uses a surrogate reporter plasmid

induction of a nuclease induced DSB, the downstream out of
frame selection gene is put back in frame in some instance due to
the H-2Kk or hygromycin

selection marker can be used to enrich for modified cells using
magnetic bead separation or antibiotic selection, respectively.
Though these non-FACS based enrichment methods are func-
tional, a new reporter plasmid must be generated for each gene
target of interest and the methods do not allow for simultaneous
isolation of individual clones[13,31].

One potential drawback of co-transposition is that there is stable
integration of a transposon vector that has the potential to be an
insertional mutagen. However, we believe that this is not a large

concern as the use of integrating lentiviral shRNA approaches to
study gene KD have become standard practice. Importantly, the
integration profile of
lentiviral vectors demonstrates a higher
propensity to integrate near oncogenes, potentially acting as an
insertional mutagen, compared to PB[32]. We would argue that
transposon integration could be beneficial as co-transposition also
offers
the opportunity to concurrently engineer clones with
heterologous genes of interest, such as the luciferase gene for in
vivo imaging. Indeed we have demonstrated that this can also be
done with massive, up to 30 kb tested, transposon vectors that
harbor 6 genes[28]. For instance, co-transposition could poten-
tially be used to generate stably expressing chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) transgenic T-cells, as previously demonstrated
using PB, and concomitantly enrich for TALEN modification of
genes to produce T-cells that are better tumor killers, longer lived,

and less susceptible to immune evasion induced by tumors[33].
Moreover,
is conceivable that co-transposition could be
combined with TAL effector guided piggyBac transposon integra-
tion, as
recently reported [34]. This may allow for both
enrichment and isolation of nuclease modified cells with the
added benefit of targeted transposon integration to a safe harbor
site, such as AAVS1.

Stable integration of a transposon vector also allowed for the
development of the conditional rescue technique described in this
manuscript. This approach has the potential to make studying loss
of essential genes possible. Moreover,
this method directly
validates that a phenotypic change induced by TALEN mediated
gene KO is due to the intended modification and not an off-target
event, as gene expression can be rescued by re-expression of the
target gene cDNA. Another feasible approach to create inducible
KO cell lines would be to perform homologous recombination
(HR) to knock in a Tet system gene trap just after the target genes
promoter,
such as rtTA-IRES-Puro-polyA-TRE. This would
interrupt normal transcription of the target gene and allow for
inducible expression of
the target gene using doxycycline.
However, the co-transposition conditional KO method is likely
superior to this idea as piggyBac integration is much more efficient
than targeted HR and to be functional the Tet system gene trap
would have to be integrated via HR at both target gene alleles.

is also functional

Our second method, co-targeting, is a highly versatile method
for enrichment and isolation of nuclease modified cells that can be
customized for many different application of
research and
potentially gene therapy. We demonstrated the use of anchorage
independent growth selection by targeting PTEN in immortalized
human Schwann cells, which can be multiplexed by use of
TALENs targeting other genes along with PTEN. PTEN KO
enrichment
immortalized and
transformed cell lines that do not typically form colonies in soft
agar but do so with the loss of PTEN function. For instance, we
have used immortalized human osteoblast cells (iOBs) and found
that PTEN loss induces robust colony formation and would likely
allow for enrichment of the TALEN mediated KO of other genes
(data not shown). More importantly, soft agar selection exemplifies
the fact that nearly any selectable phenotype achieved by co-
targeting can be used to enrich for and isolate TALEN modified
clones.

In an attempt to demonstrate proof of principle of co-targeting
for therapeutic purposes we also demonstrated successful co-
targeting of HPRT in human CD34
cord blood progenitor cells
selecting for resistance to 6-thiogaunine. We believe that targeting
HPRT for KO is potentially a viable co-targeting method for
therapeutics as HPRT is not an essential gene and in fact humans
and mice lacking functional HPRT are viable[29,30]. To our
knowledge this is the first demonstration of the use of TALENs to
cord blood progenitor cells. However, zinc-finger
modify CD34
nucleases have been used previously to modify the CCR5 locus in
progenitor cells by nucleofection of plasmid DNA with
CD34
mean gene modification rates of up to 17% by CEL-I assay[6,35].
Interestingly, we were unable to detect TALEN nuclease
the HPRT, CCR5, or ARTEMIS loci with our
activity at
nucleofection procedures. This result was unexpected, as all of
these TALEN pairs had been previously validated in transformed
cell
in
nucleofection parameters as we typically only achieved transfec-
tion efficiencies ranging from 10–30%; or perhaps the repetitive
nature or large size of the TALEN proteins has a detrimental effect
on their expression in this cell population. However, using co-
targeting HPRT with 6-TG selection HPRT gene modification was
as high as 50% and this method combined with CCR5 TALENs

line. This discrepancy could be due to differences

Enrichment & Isolation of Nuclease Modified Cells

produced gene modification rates of nearly 13% at CCR5. Thus, it
is conceivable that HPRT co-targeting could be combined with the
ZFN methods of Holt et al. to further increase rates of gene
modification of the CCR5 locus in this progenitor cell population.
Further studies will be needed to optimize TALEN delivery to
CD34

progenitor cells by nucleofection.

In summary, co-transposition and co-targeting are simple and
efficient methods
for enrichment and isolation of TALEN
modified cells and are likely compatible with other nuclease
technologies. These methods will undoubtedly expedite generation
of KO cell lines for basic research studies and hold promise to
improve the success of generating therapeutic cells for treatment of
genetic diseases.
