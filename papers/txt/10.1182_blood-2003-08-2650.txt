NEOPLASIA

Somatic inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells results in a progressive
myeloproliferative disorder

The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes
a guanosine triphosphotase (GTPase)–
activating protein that negatively regu-
lates Ras signaling and is inactivated in a
subset of juvenile myelomonocytic leuke-
mias (JMMLs). Adoptive transfer of fetal
liver cells from Nf1 mutant mice models
JMML; however, this system has impor-
tant limitations as a platform for perform-
ing biologic and preclinical studies. We
Introduction

have exploited the interferon-inducible
Mx1-Cre transgene to ablate a conditional
mutant Nf1 allele in hematopoietic cells.
Somatic inactivation of Nf1 induces a
myeloproliferative disorder with 100%
penetrance that is associated with a sub-
acute clinical course, tissue inﬁltration by
myeloid cells, hypersensitivity to granulo-
cyte-macrophage colony stimulating fac-
tor, hyperproliferation, and resistance to

apoptosis. These Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice
establish a tractable experimental model
for testing therapeutics and for identify-
ing mutations that cooperate with hyper-
active Ras in myeloid leukemogenesis.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myelopro-
liferative disease (MPD) characterized by monocytosis, thrombocytope-
nia, splenomegaly, and malignant inﬁltration of the skin, lymph nodes,
lungs, liver, and other organs (reviewed in Emanuel et al1 and Arico et
al2). The clinical course is relentless, and bone marrow transplantation is
the only treatment that cures more than 10% of patients. Selective
hypersensitivity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-
GM) progenitors to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) is an in vitro hallmark of JMML.3,4 The incidence of JMML
is increased more than 200-fold in children with neuroﬁbromatosis type
1 (NF1)5,6; this observation provided a starting point for elucidating the
molecular basis of aberrant myeloid growth in this disorder. The NF1
gene encodes neuroﬁbromin, a guanosine triphosphotase (GTPase)–
activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates p21ras (Ras) output by
accelerating GTP hydrolysis (reviewed in Boguski and McCormick,7
Bernards,8 and Donovan et al9). Analysis of JMML cells from children
with NF1 revealed homozygous NF1 inactivation because of somatic
loss of the normal allele, which is associated with hyperactive Ras.10-13
Two groups used homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells to disrupt Nf1, the murine homolog of NF1.14,15
Approximately 10% of heterozygous (Nf1⫹/⫺) mutant mice
spontaneously develop a MPD that resembles JMML during the
second year of life.14 Homozygous mutant (Nf1⫺/⫺) embryos fail
around embryonic day 13 (E13) with cardiovascular defects14,15;
however, CFU-GM colonies derived from mutant fetal livers
show hypersensitive growth in response to GM-CSF that is
similar to human JMML cells.11,16 Importantly, adoptive transfer
of Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells consistently induces a JMML-like

MPD in irradiated recipient mice.16 Nf1 inactivation leads to
deregulated growth in multiple hematopoietic compartments
and confers a durable proliferative advantage in competitive
repopulation assays.17,18 In addition, a cross between Nf1 and
Gmcsf mutant mice demonstrated that aberrant GM-CSF signal-
ing plays a central role in initiating and maintaining the
JMML-like MPD in vivo.19

In a previous study, irradiated recipient mice that received
transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal
liver cells were harnessed to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of an inhibitor of the Ras processing
enzyme farnesyltransferase, which included pharmacodynamic
monitoring in primary hematopoietic cells.20 However,
this
model is both expensive and cumbersome because it requires
maintaining a large breeding colony, performing multiple timed
matings followed by embryo dissections around E13, and
injecting fetal
liver cells into irradiated hosts. A “second-
generation” mutant strain was recently engineered by introduc-
ing loxP sites into the Nf1 locus by homologous recombina-
tion.21 Somatic inactivation of this Nf1ﬂox allele, which is
functionally wild type in the basal state, can be achieved by
expressing Cre recombinase in speciﬁc cell types.21,22 We have
exploited the interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre strain23 to ablate Nf1
in hematopoietic cells, and we ﬁnd that this consistently results
in an MPD that is associated with leukocytosis, splenomegaly,
hyperproliferation, impaired apoptosis, and in vitro hypersensi-
tivity to GM-CSF. We further describe the consequences of Nf1
inactivation on proliferation, survival, and Ras signaling in
these mice.

Materials and methods

and spectral karyotyping were performed as described previously.25 A
minimum of 10 metaphase cells were analyzed per case.

Breeding and treatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pI-pC)

Adoptive transfer protocol

Nf1ﬂox and Mx1-Cre mice were produced and characterized as described
elsewhere.21,23 Compound mutant (Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox) animals were
generated on a mixed 129/Sv ⫻ C57BL/6 background. Pups received a
single intraperitoneal injection at 3 to 5 days of age with 50 ␮L pI-pC
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) at a concentration of 10 ␮g/␮L diluted in sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice were maintained in the sterile
animal care facility at
the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) and were fed pelleted chow and acidiﬁed water ad libitum. The
experimental procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on
Animal Research.

Recipient mice were lethally irradiated with a single fraction of 900 cGy by
using a cesium source that delivered irradiation at 227 rad/min. Sublethal
irradiation was administered at a dose of 450 cGy. Recipient mice (8 weeks
old) were injected with donor cells immediately after irradiation. Mice were
warmed for 5 minutes under a heat lamp to induce tail-vein dilation.
Hematopoietic cells (2 ⫻ 106 per recipient) were suspended in 500 ␮L
IMDM with 20% FCS and injected through a 28-gauge needle into the
dorsal tail vein. Recipients received prophylactic oral antibiotics, consisting
of polymyxin sulfate and neomycin sulfate for 2 weeks after irradiation.
CBCs were measured serially between 7 and 24 weeks after transplantation.

Genotyping

Progenitor growth

We isolated DNA from blood samples using the GFX Genomic Blood
DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Genotyping
of the Nf1ﬂox and recombined allele was carried out by using the primer
sequence and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions as described
by Zhu et al.21 Genotyping for the Mx1-Cre allele was performed by
using primers Cre1 (5⬘-CTG CAT TAC CGG TCG ATG CAA C-3⬘) and
Cre2 (5⬘-GCA TTG CTG TCA CTT GGT CGT G-3⬘). Thermal cycle
conditions were 94°C for 5 minutes and then 32 cycles of 94°C for 30
seconds and 70°C for 1 minute. The presence of a 300-bp band is
indicative of the Mx1-Cre transgene.

Monitoring and isolation of hematopoietic cells

Mice were bled at 1.5, 3, and 5 months of age by nicking the dorsal tail
veins with a surgical blade. Tail-vein blood samples (50-100 ␮L) were
obtained for complete blood counts (CBCs). Samples were analyzed by
using a Hemavet 850FS (DREW Scientiﬁc, Oxford, CT). Automated
differential cell counts were used to monitor differentiated leukocyte
populations over time. Criteria for killing mice by CO2 inhalation included
a disheveled appearance, hunching, abnormal gait, and pallor. Bone marrow
cells were collected by removing tibias and femurs and ﬂushing out the
marrow cavity with Iscove modiﬁed Dulbecco medium (IMDM; GIBCO-
BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Single cell suspensions were prepared
by gently drawing the cells through a 25-gauge needle. Cell viabilities were
ascertained by trypan blue exclusion.

CFU-GM colonies were grown from bone marrow cells and splenocytes.
These assays were performed in methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) containing glutamine, penicillin/
streptomycin, ␤-mercaptoethanol (BME), and varying doses of recombi-
nant murine GM-CSF. Bone marrow and spleen cells were cultured at
5 ⫻ 104 and 1 ⫻ 105 cells/mL, respectively. Duplicate plates containing
1 mL medium were established and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 8
days. The colonies were scored through a binocular light microscope under
4 ⫻ magniﬁcation. To assess the effects of 13 cis retinoic acid (13cRA) on
CFU-GM growth, various concentrations of the drug (10⫺4 M to 10⫺6 M)
diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to the medium immedi-
ately before plating.

Proliferation assay

The incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma) was mea-
sured in vivo in mice that were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg BrdU/
6 g body weight. The mice were killed 6 hours later, and marrow cells and
splenocytes were collected and resuspended in IMDM supplemented with
20% FCS. Red cell lysis was performed as described in “Monitoring and
isolation of hematopoietic cells,” and the cells were washed with PBS. Cells
were incubated overnight with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% Tween-20
at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in DNAse (Sigma) for 30
minutes at 37°C. After 2 additional washes with PBS, cells were stained
with BrdU-FITC (Pharmingen) for 20 minutes. The cells were washed
twice with PBS and then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

Pathologic analysis and ﬂow cytometry

Apoptosis assay

Blood smears and cytospins were stained with Wright Giemsa (Sigma).
Spleens and sternums were collected and sent for sectioning to the Mouse
Pathology Shared Resource at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center.
CBCs were measured in peripheral blood, and manual differential counts
(100-400 cells) were determined from Wright Giemsa–stained smears
(blood) or cytospins (bone marrow or spleen) by using published recommen-
dations.24 Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was per-
formed on peripheral blood, bone marrow, and splenocytes. Peripheral
blood cells were incubated in red blood cell lysis buffer (0.16 M NH4Cl,
0.1 M KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]) for 10
minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed twice in PBS and
resuspended in PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), divided into
aliquots, and placed in tubes; antibodies were added on ice to prevent
capping. Isotype control antibodies conjugated to the ﬂuorochromes
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE) were used to
determine background ﬂuorescence, and a panel of lineage-speciﬁc antibod-
ies was used, including CD3, B220, Gr-1, Mac1, c-kit, and Sca-1 (all
antibodies from Pharmingen). Analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree
Star, San Carlos, CA), and data were collected using CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis

Cytogenetic analysis was performed on spleen cells from mice with MPD.
The initiation of short-term (24 hours) cultures, metaphase cell preparation,

Bone marrow cells were harvested in IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS,
and the red cells were lysed as described in “Proliferation assay.” The cells
were resuspended in PBS with 2% FCS and 1.5 mM calcium chloride
before staining with Annexin-GFP (a gift from Dr Joel Ernst, University of
California, San Francisco) for 15 minutes at 4°C. The labeled cells were
washed once in PBS and then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

Isolation of Mac1-positive bone marrow cells

Bone marrow cells were harvested from tibias and femurs in 0.1% serum
without growth factors and were labeled with an antimouse CD11b
(Mac1)–PE antibody (1:50; Pharmingen) after red cell lysis. The stained
cells were incubated with paramagnetic anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 15 minutes at 4°C. The cells
were passed through a 40-␮ ﬁlter and were separated on an AutoMACS
instrument using program Possel (Miltenyi Biotech). This procedure
consistently yields more than 98% Mac1-positive cells.

Western blotting and Ras-GTP assay

Unfractionated bone marrow or Mac1-positive cells were incubated in 0.1%
serum without growth factors for 4 hours, then stimulated with 0 or 10
ng/mL GM-CSF for 5 minutes. The cells were washed once with PBS
containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and lysed in 25 mM HEPES
(N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N⬘-2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5, 150 mM

NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2,
25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na orthovanadate, and COMPLETE protease inhibitors
(Amersham). Protein concentrations were quantitated and equalized for
loading by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Samples were boiled for 5 minutes in 1 ⫻ Laemli buffer, run on a 10% Tris
(tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)–HCl Criterion Precast Gel (Bio-Rad),
and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were
blocked for 1 hour in TBS-Tween containing 5% milk prior to overnight
incubation at 4°C with antiphospho-MEK 1/2 (mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase 1 and 2; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA),
antiphospho-Akt (1:5000; a gift from Dr David Stokoe, University of
California, San Francisco), anti-MEK 1/2 (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technolo-
gies), and anti-Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies). The blots were
developed with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antirabbit
antibody (Amersham). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemilumines-
cence (Amersham). Ras-GTP levels were measured as described elsewhere
by precipitating GTP-bound Ras with a fusion protein that includes the Ras
binding domain of Raf.26

Results

Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, and Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox littermates received a single
injection of pI-pC (500 ␮g in 50␮L) at 3 to 5 days of age and were
genotyped at weaning by analyzing DNA prepared from tail clips.
As an additional control, some litters that were not treated with
pI-pC were observed for signs of systemic illness. PCR analysis of
DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes at 6 weeks of age
demonstrated complete excision of exons 31 and 32 in Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice that received pI-pC (Figure 1A). Somatic inactiva-
tion of Nf1 was dependent on inheritance of the Mx1-Cre transgene
(Figure 1A). Consistent with previous data, the Mx1-Cre transgene
was active in other tissues, and we detected partial inactivation of
Nf1 in kidney, lung, and other tissues (data not shown).

Cohorts of mice were observed for evidence of disease and by
performing serial blood counts. Leukocyte counts and the numbers
of differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells were signiﬁcantly
elevated in the Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox animals by 3 months of age
(Figure 1B). Blood smears revealed increased numbers of morpho-
logically normal lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Ani-
mals with marked leukocytosis showed occasional intermediate
myeloid forms (Figure 1C). Hemoglobin concentrations as well as
red blood cell and platelet counts remained within the normal range
(data not shown). Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice developed overt signs of
disease beginning between 5 and 6 months of age, which was
characterized by hunching, abnormal gait, and a disheveled appear-
ance, and 50% of the animals succumbed by 7.5 months (Figure
1D). This clinical syndrome was generally not accompanied by
dramatic changes in peripheral blood counts, and transformation to
acute leukemia did not occur. The development of MPD in
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice was dependent on the presence of the Mx1-Cre
transgene. Interestingly, Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice that were not
injected with pI-pC occasionally developed MPD. These animals
showed somatic inactivation of Nf1 in blood and bone marrow,
which was likely because of endogenous interferon production in
response to a subclinical infection or another stimulus (data not shown).
Pathologic analysis of sick Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice revealed
progressive splenomegaly with extensive inﬁltration of myeloid
cells at various stages of maturation (Figure 2A-C). There was
periportal invasion within the liver (Figure 2B) but not in other
tissues. The bone marrow was highly cellular and comprised
myeloid cells at various stages of differentiation (Figure 2C-D).
FACS analysis conﬁrmed the presence of a high percentage of
myeloid cells (Mac1⫹ and Gr1⫹ cells) (Figure 2E). Increased
numbers of Mac-1⫹, Gr-1lo cells, which are likely to represent

to a deletion of exon 31 (⌬31) is visible in 2 pups that inherited the Mx1-Cre transgene

immature monocytic cells, were identiﬁed consistently. Cytoge-
netic and spectral karyotype analysis of spleen samples from 6
diseased mice did not reveal clonal karyotypic abnormalities.
According to guidelines published by the Hematopathology Sub-
committee of the Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium
(MMHCC),24 this disorder is classiﬁed as a myeloproliferative
disease. This MPD models many features of human JMML,
including increased numbers of differentiated granulocytic and
monocytic cells, hypersensitivity to GM-CSF (see later in this
section), and a subacute course. It is similar to the MPD that arises
in lethally irradiated mice that are repopulated with homozygous
Nf1-deﬁcient fetal liver cells16,19; however, the course is somewhat
more indolent. A complete histologic and FACS panel on the model
has been posted on the MMHCC website (http://emice.nci.nih.gov/
emice/mouse_models/organ_models/hema_models/hema_mouse_
class/myelopro_disease/mpd).

A recent study in which a Krox20-Cre transgene was used to
ablate Nf1 in Schwann cells found that the incidence and pen-
etrance of benign neuroﬁbromas was markedly increased in a
in Krox20-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/⫺
heterozygous mutant background (ie,
versus Krox20-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice).22 On the basis of these data,
we generated Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/⫺ mice to determine whether het-
erozygous inactivation of Nf1 in nonhematopoietic cells present in
the bone marrow microenvironment might modulate the subacute
course of the MPD. In this experiment, Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/⫺ pups that
were injected with pI-pC at 3 to 5 days of age developed MPD with
similar blood counts, disease latency, and survival as Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice (data not shown).

marrow. By contrast, no CFU-GM colonies were obtained from the
spleens of control mice (data not shown).

Retinoids partially correct the abnormal pattern of CFU-GM
colony growth that is a hallmark of JMML,1,27 and 13cRA induces
transient clinical and hematologic improvement in some patients.28
We, therefore, compared the effects of 13cRA on CFU-GM growth
from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox and control bone marrows. As shown in
Figure 3, Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox marrows contained elevated numbers
of CFU-GM, which were larger than wild-type colonies. Addition
of 10⫺6 to 10⫺4 M 13cRA to methylcellulose cultures stimulated
with 10 ng/mL GM-CSF induced proliferation of background cells
as well as a dose-dependent reduction in the size of CFU-GM
colonies. These effects were not selective but were observed in
both mutant and wild-type cultures. Furthermore, 13cRA treatment
was not associated with a reduction in the abnormally high
percentage of monocyte-macrophage cells in CFU-GM grown
from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice (data not shown).

Bone marrow mononuclear cells from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice that
had been treated with pI-pC were injected into lethally (n ⫽ 10) or
sublethally (n ⫽ 10) irradiated recipients to ascertain whether the MPD
could be transferred to secondary hosts. Each lethally irradiated recipient
was repopulated with mutant cells and developed MPD (Figure 4A). By
contrast, the leukocyte counts of mice that received a sublethal dose of
irradiation remained normal over 6 months of observation (Figure 4A).
Analysis of DNA extracted from blood leukocytes 2 to 4 months after
transplantation revealed both host and donor-derived cells in all recipi-
ents (data not shown). Nf1-deﬁcient cells made a sustained contribution
to hematopoiesis in many animals, including some in which the
wild-type band disappeared from the blood after 6 months (Figure 4B).
Interestingly, pathologic evaluation of sublethally irradiated mice
that were killed 8 months after injection of Nf1⫺/⫺ cells revealed
normal spleen size and architecture and no splenic CFU-GM
despite a substantial contribution of mutant cells to the peripheral
blood (data not shown).

We measured BrdU incorporation and performed annexin V staining
to ascertain the effects of Nf1 inactivation on the proliferation and
survival of primary hematopoietic cells. Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice with
MPD and controls were killed 6 hours after a single injection of BrdU,
and the percentages of bone marrow and spleen cells that had incorpo-
rated the label were determined by ﬂow cytometry. Whereas the fraction
of BrdU-positive cells was similar in the bone marrows of diseased and
control animals, proliferation was substantially greater within the
spleens of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice (Figure 5A). Because the percent-
ages of erythroid and myeloid cells in bone marrow and spleen differ
markedly between Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox and control mice, we also
assessed BrdU incorporation in Mac1⫹ cells. Interestingly, proliferation
was comparable in bone marrow–derived cells; however, a higher
percentage of splenic Mac1⫹ cells was labeled in the Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice (Figure 5B). Apoptosis was assessed by performing ﬂow cytom-
etry on bone marrow cells that had been labeled with an annexin
V–green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). The percentage of freshly isolated
cells stained by annexin-V was similar in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox and
normal mice (data not shown); however, the mutant cells displayed
greatly enhanced survival after 24 hours in culture without exogenous
growth factors (Figure 5C).

We compared the percentage of Ras in the active GTP-bound
conformation and assayed activation of the Ras effectors Akt and
MEK in bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox and normal mice. Unstimulated mutant cells showed a
modest increase in baseline Ras-GTP levels (Figure 6A,C), but
phosphorylation of the downstream effectors MEK and Akt were

Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice that were hypersensitive to GM-CSF
(Figure 3A-B). In addition, mutant CFU-GM colonies were larger
than normal and showed an abnormal spreading morphology
(Figure 3C-D). Increased proliferation of myeloid progenitors from

expansion in the number of cells recovered from methylcellulose

Akt activation from baseline levels that was equivalent in both
genotypes (Figure 6B-C). Because Nf1⫺/⫺ and wild-type bone

proportions of different cell types, we isolated Mac1-positive cells
and compared MEK activation in this myeloid subpopulation. In
these experiments, Nf1⫺/⫺ cells showed sustained activation of
MEK after exposure to GM-CSF (Figure 6D).

Discussion

We have developed a robust and tractable model of MPD by harnessing
the Mx1-Cre transgene to induce somatic inactivation of the Nf1 tumor
suppressor and have used these Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice to investigate
how loss of Nf1 perturbs the in vivo growth of primary hematopoietic
cells. This work extends previous studies of cultured Nf1-deﬁcient fetal
liver cells and of recipient mice repopulated with these cells.11,16-19

We selected the Mx1-Cre strain on the basis of data from other
laboratories that imply that this Cre recombinase is active in both
hematopoietic stem cells and in differentiated progeny.29-31 By
inducing biallelic excision of a targeted locus, we could readily
monitor the relative levels of recombined and unrearranged Nf1 in
blood and bone marrow. We found that a single injection of pI-pC
resulted in highly efﬁcient Nf1 inactivation in all lineages. These
results and our data showing that bone marrow from Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice mediate long-term reconstitution in lethally irradi-

ated recipients provide strong evidence that Nf1 is inactivated in the
stem-cell compartment. Furthermore, although the ultimate contri-
bution of cells that have undergone somatic recombination to
hematopoiesis will be inﬂuenced by both the structure of the
loxP-targeted allele and by how rearranging the locus modulates
cell survival and proliferation, our data underscore the value of the
Mx1-Cre strain for modifying conditional mutant alleles in hemato-
poietic cells. Importantly, although we detected signiﬁcant levels of
somatic Nf1 inactivation in some nonhematopoietic tissues, this
was not associated with any overt phenotypes in mice observed for
9 to 12 months. However,
this lack of speciﬁcity could be
problematic for analyzing other conditional mutations.

Somatic inactivation of Nf1 results in progressive splenomegaly with
a shift in hematopoiesis from the marrow to the spleen, and we identiﬁed
proliferating myeloid cells within the spleens of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice. Splenomegaly is a prominent feature of JMML, and many centers
perform splenectomies before transplantation. Although the beneﬁts of
this procedure are unclear, our data suggest that the spleen is an
important site of disease that contributes to the evolution of the murine
MPD. We also found that bone marrow cells from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice are resistant to apoptosis, which is consistent with data from
Myb-transformed myeloid cell lines.26

Previous studies of mice repopulated with Nf1⫺/⫺ cells have
emphasized the effects of Nf1 inactivation on stem cells and myeloid
lineage progenitors.16,17,19 However, limited attention has been paid to
lymphopoiesis. In addition to uniformly developing MPD, Mx1-Cre,

presence of both wild-type and mutant cells (lanes 9,10). None of these sublethally irradiated recipients had developed evidence of MPD by 8 months after adoptive transfer.

each genotype. The numbers shown in each panel indicate the percentage of positive cells.

Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice demonstrate lymphocytosis with increased numbers of
differentiated T and B cells. These data are consistent with competitive
repopulation studies, which revealed that loss of Nf1 is associated with a
proliferative advantage in both myeloid and lymphoid compartments.18
The risk of lymphoid malignancies has been examined in large
population-based studies of pediatric cancer registries in Japan and the
United Kingdom. Whereas one group identiﬁed no signiﬁcant in-
crease,32 the other report found a 5- to 10-fold higher incidence of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children with
NF1.6 A child with NF1 has been described who presented with JMML

and subsequently developed a T-cell lymphoma, both of which showed
loss of the normal NF1 allele.33 Ingram et al34 recently reported greater
thymic cellularity and a modest increase in Ras-GTP levels in RAG2-
deﬁcient mice that received transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells.
Paradoxically, Nf1⫺/⫺ T cells showed impaired proliferation in
response to T-cell mitogens. Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice provide a
model that can be used to dissect the functional consequences of
ablating Nf1 in lymphoid cells.

Consistent with previous studies of primary fetal livers and of
irradiated recipients reconstituted with these cells,11,16,17 we found that

MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER IN Nf1 MICE

4249

Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox bone marrow cells model the hypersensitive pattern
of CFU-GM colony growth that is a hallmark of JMML. These data
establish a link between Nf1 inactivation and this distinctive cellular
phenotype. On the basis of this precedent, we exposed Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox bone marrow cells to retinoids, but we did not observe
selective effects on the growth of mutant CFU-GM colonies. These data
imply that the therapeutic effects of 13cRA in JMML are not mediated
though the GM-CSF/Ras/neuroﬁbromin pathway.

Our adoptive transfer data are consistent with a previous report
in which bone marrow from recipient mice repopulated with
Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells induced MPD in secondary hosts that
received a myeloablative dose of radiation.19 In addition, serial
studies of sublethally irradiated mice demonstrated engraftment of
mutant cells in most of the recipients without overt evidence of
MPD after 8 months of observation. Furthermore, we did not detect
splenomegaly or myeloid inﬁltration even in mice in which 100%
of the peripheral blood leukocytes were derived from mutant cells.
These data are remarkably consistent with the results of competi-
tive repopulation experiments in which Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells
out-competed wild-type cells in the stem-cell compartment and in
the lymphoid and myeloid lineages but failed to induce MPD in the
absence of a high degree of chimerism.18 In another study in which
heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with exposure to cyclo-
phosphamide in leukemogenesis, some Nf1⫹/⫺ mice showed loss of
the wild-type allele without evidence of MPD when the experiment
was terminated.20 Together with these data, our results in suble-
thally irradiated recipients suggest that the presence of wild-type
bone marrow cells can retard the development of MPD in vivo.
These observations also support a model in which loss of Nf1 in a
susceptible bone marrow precursor confers a subtle growth advan-
tage that progresses to Nf1-deﬁcient hematopoiesis, followed by
splenic invasion by myeloid precursors and, ﬁnally, by overt MPD.
An unsettled question involves whether the MPD induced by Nf1
inactivation is caused by progressive overgrowth of a stable
population of mutant cells or involves clonal selection of a
subpopulation that has acquired one or more cooperating muta-
tions. Although the absence of acquired cytogenetic aberrations in
the spleens of diseased mice is consistent with the former model,
additional studies are required to resolve this issue.

We and others have detected hyperactive Ras signaling in JMML
bone marrows,11 in cell lines from Nf1 mutant mice,16,26 in c-kit–positive
bone marrow cells isolated from the recipients of Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver
cells,17 and in heterozygous Nf1 mutant mast cells.35 We were, therefore,
surprised that bone marrow mononuclear cells from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice demonstrated a small increase in the percentage of Ras-GTP in
unstimulated cells but similar levels of phosphorylated Akt and MEK
compared with control cells. However, bone marrow–derived Mac1-
positive cells from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice that were stimulated with
GM-CSF showed sustained phosphorylation of MEK. Similarly, pro-
longed activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) was recently
reported in Nf1-deﬁcient mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts in response to 1%
serum.36 Our data support a mechanism whereby Nf1 inactivation
deregulates Ras signaling in a subset of hematopoietic cells, which may
be difﬁcult to detect in whole bone marrow. The CFU-GM fraction
comprises approximately 0.1% of the nucleated cells in Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox marrow, and we speculate that these cells are especially
sensitive to loss of Nf1. Measuring the activation status of signaling
cascades in rare subsets of primary cells is a challenging problem that
will likely require adapting new methodologies such as the ﬂow
cytometry–based approach recently described by Perez and Nolan.37
Our data also raise the possibility that some types of hematopoietic cells
compensate for loss of Nf1 by attenuating signaling networks, which

may further complicate ascertaining the biochemical consequences of
leukemia-associated mutations in vivo.

In addition to facilitating studies that directly address the role of Nf1
in signal transduction and myeloid growth control, Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice are a tractable experimental system for identifying molecular
events that contribute to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The classic
studies of Land et al38 demonstrated the principle of oncogene cooperat-
ivity in cellular transformation. Kelly et al39 have applied this concept to
AML and proposed that transcription factor fusion proteins cooperate
with mutations that constitutively activate growth-promoting signal
transduction pathways in leukemogenesis. Indeed, data from mice
generally support the idea that neither type of leukemia-associated
genetic lesion is sufﬁcient to induce AML. For example, transgenic or
knock-in models of transcription factor fusions such as AML1-ETO,
PML-RARA, and MLL-AF9 either do not spontaneously develop AML
or show incomplete penetrance and prolonged latency.29,40,41 By con-
trast, although inactivating Nf1 or expressing either BCR-ABL or a
mutant FLT3 allele induces MPD,16,39,42,43 additional events are required
for AML. We envision 2 general strategies for harnessing Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice to discover genes that cooperate with Nf1 inactivation in
leukemogenesis. The ﬁrst strategy involves either performing genetic
crosses with transgenic or knock-in strains that express fusion oncopro-
teins such as PML-RARA, AML1-ETO, or MLL-AF9, or transducing
Nf1-deﬁcient bone marrow with retroviruses that encode these or other
leukemia-associated fusions followed by adoptive transfer into irradi-
ated recipients. The second approach is to harness retroviral insertional
mutagenesis to identify novel genes that cooperate with loss of Nf1 in
leukemogenesis.44,45 In an important “proof of principle” experiment,
Largaespada et al16 found that Nf1⫹/⫺ mice that were infected with the
BXH-2 retrovirus developed AML with increased penetrance and
reduced latency compared with wild-type littermates. These investiga-
tors identiﬁed inactivation of the normal Nf1 allele in approximately
85% of BXH-2/Nf1⫹/⫺ AMLs. Because both Nf1 alleles are already
mutated in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox animals that have been treated with
pI-pC, this strain is theoretically superior to Nf1⫹/⫺ mice for performing
forward genetic screens. The predictable onset of MPD and the
prolonged survival of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice may prove advantageous
for uncovering genes that cooperate in the development of AML.

Finally, Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice and cells from these animals can be
used to test molecularly targeted agents with pharmacodynamic monitor-
ing of relevant biochemical end points in primary target cells. Potential
therapeutic strategies for treating JMML include developing GM-CSF
receptor antagonists (reviewed in Iversen et al46,47 and Frankel et al48),
inhibitors of Ras processing enzymes (reviewed in Le and Shannon49),
and agents that interfere with the activation of downstream effectors
such as MEK.50 Given the important role of hyperactive Ras in myeloid
malignancies (reviewed in Lee and Shannon49 and Sawyers and
Denny51) and other cancers (reviewed in Bos52 and Hingorani and
Tuveson53), studies in this tractable disease model might identify agents
that have therapeutic potential
that extend beyond hematopoietic
malignancies.
