Abstract Youth with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have
multiple, complex symptoms associated with physical, social-
emotional, and cognitive difficulties. In addition, caring for a
child with NF1 can be extremely challenging for parents.
Since research with other chronic illness populations suggests
that social support, including internet support groups (ISGs),
can be beneficial, this survey study aimed to determine the
attitudes and preferences of adolescents and young adults with
NF1 and parents of a child with NF1 regarding ISGs. Thirty
patients and 30 caregivers completed a 24-item survey about
ISGs. Many patients and parents are not aware of any ISGs for
NF1, but are interested in using one in the future for a variety
of reasons, including to get answers to their questions about
NF1, to find out about research studies, and to discuss prob-
lems and concerns about NF1. Specific concerns of interest
include physical, social-emotional, and cognitive aspects of
NF1. ISGs have potential as a social support intervention
within the NF1 community. ISGs for the NF1 population
should include patients with NF1 (or parents of children with
NF1) as well as a health professional, and both chat rooms and
discussion boards likely would be well-received.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare, autosomal dominant
condition caused by mutations on chromosome 17. About half
of all cases are spontaneous mutations (Tonsgard 2006).
Symptoms and complications include plexiform neurofi-
bromas (PNs), café au lait macules, optic pathway gliomas,
Lisch nodules, and scoliosis, as well as cognitive deficits and
learning disabilities (Hyman et al. 2006; Tonsgard 2006).
Moreover, PNs can be disfiguring, often cause significant pain
(Kim et al. 2009), and negatively impact quality of life (QOL;
Wolkenstein et al. 2009).

With respect to social-emotional functioning, substantial
percentages of patients fall in the at-risk and clinically signif-
icant ranges (Martin et al. 2012; Reiter-Purtill et al. 2008).
Particular problem areas include depression and social with-
drawal (Martin et al. 2012). Research further suggests that
social problems in youth with NF1 are more severe in the
presence of a comorbid cognitive disorder, such as a learning
disability or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD; Barton and North 2004).

The difficulties experienced by youth with NF1 also can
pose numerous challenges to the parents who care for these
children. Research from various patient groups suggests that
caregivers of chronically ill youth are at risk for depression,
anxiety, and loneliness (Florian and Krulik 1991; Kreutzer
et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2008). Moreover, parents of ill
children experience stressors in relation to their daily activi-
ties, social and family role disruption, and the child’s treat-
ment (Palermo and Eccleston 2009). In one study that exam-
ined the well-being of parents of children with NF1, parents’
psychological functioning was within normal limits based on
a self-report questionnaire. However, perceptions of less so-
cial support were correlated with higher levels of distress in

mothers of patients with NF1; further, greater neurological
impairment in the child was associated with perceptions of
less social support and greater distress by their mothers com-
pared with mothers of children with less neurological impair-
ment (Reiter-Purtill et al. 2008). Other aspects of psycholog-
ical functioning of parents of children with NF1 have not been
given adequate attention in the literature to date.

Benefits of social support for youth with chronic illness and
their caregivers include better disease management and im-
proved physical and mental health (Janicke et al. 2009; La
Greca et al. 2002; Skinner et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2013).
Moreover, people often prefer to obtain support from similar
others, such as those with the same condition. For example,
substantial percentages of parents of children with autism
(59 %) and Down Syndrome (41 %) endorsed the need to
discuss feelings about their child with parents with a child
with the same genetic disorder (Siklos and Kerns 2006).

In recent years, researchers have sought to develop and
deliver internet-based applications, including internet support
groups (ISGs), that address a range of health-related informa-
tional and emotional needs (Beckjord et al. 2007; Escoffery
et al. 2008; Zrebiec and Jacobson 2001). ISGs offer a means
of connecting geographically diverse individuals with similar
challenges in order to provide support and understanding. The
goal of ISGs is to facilitate positive changes such as improved
self-esteem and coping (Melling and Houguet-Pincham
2011).

ISGs have been shown to be helpful in patients with a
variety of conditions, including cancer (Winzelberg et al.
2003), diabetes (Merkel and Wright 2012), HIV (Mo and
Coulson 2013), and Huntington’s disease (Coulson et al.
2007). However, we found no published reports on ISGs for
individuals with NF1. Moreover, a critical first step in design-
ing and assessing interventions involves establishing the
needs of the patients and families (Wen and Gustafson
2004). Research suggests that, while social support is a fre-
quently reported need among patients with genetic disorders
and their families (Kang et al. 2010), specific support-related
needs can differ among disorders (Siklos and Kerns 2006).
Thus, the aim of this survey study was to determine the
attitudes and needs of youth with NF1 and their caregivers
regarding the use of ISGs.

Method

Participants

Eligible participants for the patient survey included adoles-
cents and young adults ages 12 to 25 years with NF1 who
were enrolled on a NF1 natural history or treatment protocol at
a government research institute. Most of the patients on this
study had one or more plexiform neurofibroma tumors.

Eligible parent respondents had to be the primary caregiver
of a child with NF1 who was participating in a study at the
institute. The target enrollment was 30 patients and 30 parents.

Instrumentation and Procedures

The patient and parent surveys, developed by members of our
institution’s Neurobehavioral Group and NF1 medical re-
search team, each contained 24 items and took 10 min or less
to complete. The items asked about past use of ISGs, current
sources of emotional support, barriers to ISG use, the likeli-
hood of using an ISG in the future, and preferences for ISG
format and topics. Items were in multiple choice (15 items), 4-
point Likert-scale (6 items), and open-ended format (3 items).
For many of the multiple-choice questions, respondents were
able to choose “other” and write in their own response as
appropriate. The initial version was piloted with two patients
and two parents, and minor modifications were made based on
their input. The final version of the patient survey is displayed
in the Appendix. Because the survey was anonymous, the
Office of Human Subjects Research approved the project
and determined it was exempt from review by the Institutional
Review Board. A research assistant or member of the NF1
medical team administered the final surveys during a routine
outpatient clinic visit.

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed on the survey variables.
Data were analyzed using SAS statistical software Version 8
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Open-ended responses were
reviewed by two co-authors for content and specific examples
are given in the text, where appropriate.

Results

Thirty-one patients and 32 parents were consecutively
approached for participation; one patient and two parents
declined to participate citing a lack of interest. Thus, 30
patients ages 12 to 25 years and 30 parents (not necessarily
of the same 30 patients) completed the survey.

Past ISG Use

Of the 30 patient respondents, two (7 %) reported using an
ISG in the past year. Of those, one reported finding it “very
helpful” and one found it “somewhat helpful.” Reasons for
using an ISG in the past included wanting to help others with
NF1 (n=2), wanting to talk to others about feelings they had
related to NF1 (n=1), wanting health information (n=1), and
wanting to talk about things not related to NF1 (n=1). Open-
ended responses regarding what was helpful about the ISG

798

Martin et al.

included “having a lot of people to answer a question” and
“[talking] about where the tumors grow.”

Of the 30 parent respondents, nine (30 %) reported using an
ISG in the past year. Of these nine parents, one found it “very
helpful,” three found it “somewhat helpful,” and five found it
“a little helpful.” Reasons for doing so included wanting
medical information about NF1 (n=6), to get emotional sup-
port related to their child having NF1 (n=4), and to support
others (n=3). Similarly, responses to an open-ended question
that asked parents what was helpful about the ISG, indicated
both informational and emotional reasons, including “I got
names of doctors and made friends” and “Generally knowing
we are not alone.”

Current Sources of Support

Patients were asked who they typically talk to about any
feelings or worries they had related to their NF1. Responses
included: parents (50 %, n=15), physicians (30 %, n=9), and
therapists (7 %, n=2). While about one third (n=11) of pa-
tients reported talking to a friend who does not have NF1, only
one patient (3 %) reported talking to a friend with NF1.
Seventeen percent (n=5) of patients stated that they do not
talk to anyone about worries or feelings related to their NF1.
Among parents, the most common sources of emotional
support regarding their child’s NF1 were family members
(73 %, n=22) and spouses (63 %, n=19). Less commonly,
they reported being supported by physicians (33 %, n=11) and
therapists (7 %, n=2). Sixty-seven percent (n=20) noted get-
ting support from a friend without a child with NF1, while
only 13 % (n=4) said they were supported by a friend with a
child with NF1.

Barriers to ISG Use

On a multiple-choice item, the most commonly endorsed reason
for patients not using an ISG currently was not knowing of any
(69 %, n=21). A few patients reported not knowing how to join
one (10 %, n=3), not wanting to communicate with people they
did not know (14 %, n=4), thinking it would not be helpful
(7 %, n=2), preferring to obtain support through other people or
places (7 %, n=2), or not having access to a computer (3 %, n=
1). No patients reported that their parent(s) would not allow
them to use an ISG. On these items, respondents could endorse
more than one option so the total is greater than 100 %.

The most frequent reasons parents cited for not using an
ISG currently included not knowing of any (58 %, n=12),
feeling they would rather receive support from other sources
(19 %, n=4), and feeling that the information they encoun-
tered or hearing about other people’s problems would be
overwhelming or depressing (14 %, n=3). Other reasons were
related to not wanting to talk to others about their problems
(12 %, n=3) and not knowing how to join an ISG (8 %, n=2).

Future ISG Use

When patients were asked how likely they would be to
use an ISG in the future, nearly half (48 %, n= 14)
indicated they would be “likely” or “very likely” to use
an ISG to connect with others with NF1; fewer wanted
to connect with others with any chronic illness (31 %,
n= 9). Additional reasons included to get answers to
questions about NF1 (45 %, n=13), to find out about
research studies (34 %, n=10), and to talk about prob-
lems or worries (31 %, n=9). It should be noted that one
patient did not answer this question, and so percentages
are out of 29 rather than 30 patients.

Parents reported being “likely” or “very likely” to use an
ISG to find out about research studies (87 %, n=26), to talk to
other parents of children with NF1 (67 %, n=20), and to get
answers to their questions about NF1 (50 %, n=15).

ISG Preferences

When asked about their preferences regarding ISG format, the
majority of patients indicated interest in a chat room that
would allow them to “talk” to other patients with NF1 in real
time, i.e., in a scheduled chat session (73 %, n=22). Fifty-four
percent reported interest in a discussion board where they
could post messages at any time for other patients with NF1,
and slightly fewer respondents noted a preference for a chat
room (50 %, n=15) or discussion board (50 %, n=15) where
they could communicate with a health professional. More-
over, 81 % (n=24) reported that they would prefer an ISG that
was available only to others with NF1, while 19 % (n=6)
would be open to an ISG accessible to patients with any
chronic illness.

Parents indicated interest in a discussion board (67 %,
n=20) or chat room (53 %, n=16) to communicate with
other parents of children with NF1. Similar interest was
garnered for a discussion board (67 %, n=20) or chat
room (53 %, n=16) for communicating with a health
professional. In addition, parents strongly preferred an
ISG open only to parents of children with NF1 (90 %,
n=27) as opposed to an ISG open to parents of children
with any chronic illness (10 %, n=3).

ISG Topics

Topics that patients expressed interest in communicating
about via an ISG included treatment studies (80 %, n=24),
physical effects of NF1 (70 %, n=21), social-emotional topics
(e.g., depression, stress; 40 %, n=12), and cognitive/academic
problems (33 %, n=10). Topics of interest among parents
included treatment studies (90 %, n=27), physical effects of
NF1 (73 %, n=22), social-emotional topics (60 %, n=18), and
cognitive/academic problems (57 %, n=17).

Discussion

Study Limitations and Research Recommendations

To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of attitudes and
needs regarding ISGs within the NF1 population. To date, no
social support intervention studies have been published that
address the challenges faced by patients and parents of
children with NF1, although social support has demon-
strated associations with positive outcomes in other
chronic conditions (Hoekstra-Weebers et al. 2001; Mona-
ghan et al. 2011; Rearick et al. 2011). Internet support
groups may offer a unique opportunity to connect geo-
graphically separated individuals with NF1 and their
families.
Indeed, while approximately one-third and
two-thirds of patients and parents, respectively, reported
receiving emotional support regarding the child’s NF1
from friends, only 3 % of children and 13 % of parents
received such support from a friend with NF1 or a friend with
a child with NF1, respectively. Comments from participants
suggest that this was largely because they did not know any
other families with a child with NF1.

Among our sample of youth with NF1 and parents of
a child with NF1, past or current use of ISGs was rare.
The primary reason for not using an ISG was not know-
ing of any. However, the majority of patients and parents
reported being interested in utilizing such a group in the
future for a variety of reasons, including getting answers
to questions about NF1, discussing problems, and finding
out about research studies. Topics of interest were treat-
ment studies, as well as the physical, social-emotional,
and cognitive effects of NF1. These topics parallel prior
reports in the literature describing the common symp-
toms and challenges related to NF1 (Martin et al. 2012;
Tonsgard 2006). Future investigations could examine
relationships between ISG use and demographic factors
(e.g., age, gender) as well.

Practice Implications

Although several internet sites exist where individuals with
NF1 and their family members can communicate with each
other, a considerable percentage of patients and parents in our
sample were not aware of any. Practitioners are encouraged to
help patients and family members find an ISG that is appro-
priate to their needs. Given the preferences noted by our
sample, ISGs for the NF1 population should include opportu-
nities for communication with other patients (or parents) as
well as a health professional. Thus, opportunities exist for
professionals such as genetic counselors, therapists, and
nurses to volunteer their time and expertise with an ISG.
Interest among respondents in both chat rooms and discussion
boards are indicated, as well as a preference for ISGs that are
open to the NF1 community, rather than to individuals with
any chronic condition.

Our relatively small sample size limits generalizability of our
findings. In addition, most of the patients at our clinic have
plexiform tumors, and thus our sample’s responses may not be
representative of the NF1 population as a whole. However,
given the rarity of NF1, results can be considered as providing
preliminary support for ISGs as a potential intervention. In
addition, while we found that patients and parents of children
with NF1 reported that they would be amenable to participating
in an ISG, we cannot speculate about whether they actually
would engage in one, nor can we know the impact that partic-
ipation would have on emotional well-being or quality of life.
Future longitudinal intervention studies are needed in that
regard, with consideration of factors associated with attitudes
and barriers to ISG use. Optimally, randomized trials compar-
ing an ISG to a control group would allow for conclusions as to
the effectiveness of the intervention. Mediating factors or sub-
groups that benefit differentially from the ISG should be con-
sidered. Our group currently is developing a pilot study to
assess the preliminary effectiveness of an ISG in the NF1
population, with the methodology guided by our survey results.

Conclusions

ISGs have the potential for offering a much-needed source of
social support for youth with NF1 and their parents. Based on
numerous outcome studies from other disease groups, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that ISGs targeting the NF1 com-
munity would be beneficial. Our findings have implications
for designing and implementing ISGs for youth with NF1 and
their parents. Future studies are needed to target the social-
emotional needs of youth with NF1 and their families through
internet-delivered interventions.
