Abstract

Genome-wide studies have identiﬁed a high-risk subgroup of
pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) harboring muta-
tions in the Janus kinases (JAK). The purpose of this study was to
assess the preclinical efﬁcacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor AZD1480,
both as a single agent and in combination with the MEK inhibitor
selumetinib, against
JAK-mutated patient-derived xenografts.
Patient-derived xenografts were established in immunodeﬁcient
mice from bone marrow or peripheral blood biopsy specimens,
and their gene expression proﬁles compared with the original
patient biopsies by microarray analysis. JAK/STAT and MAPK
signaling pathways, and the inhibitory effects of targeted drugs,
were interrogated by immunoblotting of phosphoproteins. The
antileukemic effects of AZD1480 and selumetinib, alone and in
combination, were tested against JAK-mutated ALL xenografts
both in vitro and in vivo. Xenografts accurately represented the

primary disease as determined by gene expression proﬁling.
Cellular phosphoprotein analysis demonstrated that JAK-mutat-
ed xenografts exhibited heightened activation status of JAK/STAT
and MAPK signaling pathways compared with typical B-cell
precursor ALL xenografts, which were inhibited by AZD1480
exposure. However, AZD1480 exhibited modest single-agent
in vivo efﬁcacy against
JAK-mutated xenografts. Combining
AZD1480 with selumetinib resulted in profound synergistic in
vitro cell killing, although these results were not translated in vivo
despite evidence of target inhibition. Despite validation of target
inhibition and the demonstration of profound in vitro synergy
between AZD1480 and selumetinib, it is likely that prolonged
target inhibition is required to achieve in vivo therapeutic enhance-
ment between JAK and MEK inhibitors in the treatment of JAK-
mutated ALL. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(2); 364–74. Ó2014 AACR.

Introduction

Although the overall cure rate for the most common pediatric
cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) now approaches
90%, certain high-risk subtypes experience shorter remission
duration and a signiﬁcantly reduced likelihood of survival (1).

Recent genome-wide studies have focused on the molecular
characterization of these high-risk subtypes, including B-cell
precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) harboring mutations in the Janus
kinases (JAKs; JAK-mutated ALL; refs. 2–4). Activating mutations
in the pseudokinase or kinase domains of JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3
were detected in approximately 10% of high-risk pediatric ALL
cases, and are frequently accompanied by deletion of the IKZF1
gene. These cases also exhibit gene expression signatures similar to
BCR-ABL1–positive ALL, despite the absence of BCR-ABL1 trans-
locations (2–4). The presence of JAK mutations in pediatric ALL
with this "Kinase-like" gene expression signature is also signiﬁ-
cantly associated with high expression of cytokine receptor–like
factor 2 (CRLF2) and a dismal outcome (2–4).

JAK mutations and CRLF2 overexpression result in aberrant
activation of downstream signaling pathways, including JAK/
STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways
(5–10). Cross-talk between the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K path-
ways has also been shown to occur at multiple levels (11).
Constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway enhances the
MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, causes cytokine-indepen-
dent cell survival and proliferation of lymphoid cells (4, 5, 9, 12),
and is implicated in the progression of lymphoproliferative dis-
eases such as ALL, as well as other cancers (11, 13, 14). Conse-
quently, they are compelling pathways for the development of
targeted therapeutics to improve cancer treatment.

Several small molecules with inhibitory activity against JAK
family members have shown preclinical and clinical activity in the
treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms, which harbor the
JAK2 V617F mutation, as well as other solid tumors (15–20).
Although the JAK2 V617F mutation is different from those that
occur in ALL, these mutations occur in the same region of the
protein and are functionally analogous in vitro (4, 5). AZD1480 is
an ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2
that also shows some selectivity towards JAK3 (20, 21). AZD1480
was selected by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP)
for preclinical efﬁcacy testing against a panel of xenografts estab-
lished in immunodeﬁcient mice that were derived from high-risk
pediatric ALL patient subtypes, including those harboring JAK
point mutations, JAK2 fusions, high CRLF2 expression, and a
Kinase-like gene expression proﬁle. This rationale was based on
the success achieved with imatinib in the treatment of BCR-ABL1–
positive leukemia (22).

The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was recently shown to
exhibit greater in vivo efﬁcacy against two Kinase-like pediatric
ALL patient-derived xenografts with activation of the JAK/STAT
axis (one via a BCR-JAK2 translocation) but without CRLF2
overexpression, compared with several xenografts derived from
Kinase-like cases harboring JAK point mutations and CRLF2
overexpression (23). This observation suggests that alternative
survival pathways activated by CRLF2 may result in reduced
sensitivity of ALL cells with activated JAK/STAT signaling to
single-agent JAK inhibitors. Therefore, because xenografts estab-
lished from JAK-mutated/CRLF2-high ALL biopsies would also
be expected to exhibit heightened activation of the MAPK and
PI3K/AKT pathways in addition to JAK/STAT (4, 5, 9, 12), we
sought to enhance antileukemic efﬁcacy by targeting multiple
signaling nodes using the combination of AZD1480 and the
MEK inhibitor, selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886). Selu-
metinib is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2, which
blocks ERK1/2 activation (24). Despite strong evidence of
in vitro synergy between AZD1480 and selumetinib, both drugs
exhibited modest in vivo single-agent and combination efﬁcacy.
These ﬁndings highlight the complexity of translating in vitro
synergistic drug combinations to the in vivo setting, and suggest
that prolonged target inhibition may be required to achieve
in vivo therapeutic beneﬁt using JAK inhibitors for the treatment
of pediatric ALL cases harboring JAK point mutations and high
CRLF2 expression.

Affymetrix U133_Plus_2.0 expression arrays

RNA from 38 xenograft samples was isolated from cryopre-
served cells, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix U133_Plus_2.0
arrays as previously described (2). These new data, and the 13
parental samples analyzed in our prior study, were also masked
and normalized by MAS5 as previously reported (2). The gene
expression dataset can be accessed via Gene Expression Omnibus
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession numbers
GSE11877 and GSE58290. The xenograft samples were scanned
in 2011, whereas the parent samples were scanned in 2006.
The results for the 3 microarray quality control inclusion criteria
are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Samples were retained
0
only if all 3 conditions were satisﬁed: scale factors <35; GAPDH 3
signal for M33197 >15,000; and, the GAPDH 3
ratio < 3.5. All
but one of the xenografts (XRL_24) met these conditions.

Of the 54,675 probe sets on the Affytmetrix U133_Plus_2.0
array, 89 represent X- and Y-speciﬁc transcripts associated with
sex, 62 are Affymetrix controls, and 20 are globins. Removal of
these resulted in 54,504 potentially informative probe sets. The
average median expression across all the arrays was 173. A
minimally interpretable expression level of 500 (3-fold back-
ground) was established and all values <500 were set to a baseline
of 500 for subsequent analysis. A total of 18,090 probe sets
(33.2%) showed no signals greater than this baseline for any of
the samples, leaving 36,414 probe sets for a comparison of
xenografts to parental samples.

Quantitative RT-PCR

One microgram of total RNA was converted to cDNA using
the High Capacity cDNA kit (Life Technologies). This was diluted
to 50 mL and mixed with an equal volume of TaqMan Universal
Master Mix II without UNG (Life Technologies). The 24 genes
and an endogenous control gene (EEF2) were selected from
the group of inventoried assays (available upon request) and
were plated on custom microﬂuidic cards (Life Technologies). The
sample ports were ﬁlled with the cDNA/master mix and the cards
were sealed and run on an ABI model 7900HT instrument using
the following parameters: 94.5
C for 10 minutes followed by
40 cycles of 97.0
C for 1 minute. A
manual Ct threshold of 0.2 and automatic baseline were applied
as analysis settings. The raw Ct value for the endogenous control
sample, EEF2, was required to be <30. The DCt values were cal-
culated by subtracting the EEF2 Ct from each gene's Ct. Even
though most samples had EEF2 Ct values much less than 30, a
maximum DCt of 10 was applied to all gene intensities to permit
equivalent treatment across all samples.

Pretreatment leukemia specimens were obtained from 21 chil-
dren with high-risk BCP-ALL enrolled in the Children's Oncology
Group (COG) P9906 clinical
trial, and were molecularly
characterized by the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Gen-
erate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative (Table 1; ref. 3).
Procedures by which continuous xenografts are routinely estab-
lished from childhood ALL biopsies in female 6–8 week old 20–25 g

(NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ,
SCID/IL-2 receptor gamma
NSG) mice, and criteria for determining successful engraftment,
have been described in detail previously (25–27). Additional
established BCP-ALL (ALL-4, ALL-10JAK1/V658L, ALL-19, ALL-25
and ALL-26) and T-ALL (ALL-31) xenografts were included in
this study (26). JAK mutations are detailed where annotated.

Statistical and analytical software

Affymetrix microarray data were analyzed using Expression
Console (build 1.3.0.187, Affymetrix). Microﬂuidic cards were
analyzed using SDS 2.4.1 software (Life Technologies). Heatmaps
were created using MATLAB and its Bioinformatics toolbox
(R2013b; MathWorks).

In vitro culture and drug treatments

Xenograft cells were retrieved from cryostorage and resus-
pended in QBSF-60 medium (Quality Biological) supplemented
with Flt-3 ligand (20 ng/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomy-
cin (100 mg/mL), and L-glutamine (2 mmol/L). Viability was
determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Before treatment, cells were
plated in 96-well plates (100 mL/well) at a density previously

C in
5% CO2. Cells were exposed to 10-fold serial dilutions of
 12 mol/L)
AZD1480 or selumetinib (AstraZeneca; 10
for 72 hours, following which AlamarBlue reagent (Life Techno-
logies) was added and ﬂuorescence was measured at 0, 6, and
24 hours using a ﬂuorescent plate reader (VICTOR3; PerkinElmer;
excitation 560 nm, emission 590 nm). For ﬁxed ratio combina-
tion assays, cells were treated with AZD1480 and selumetinib,
alone or in combination, at 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 mmol/L. The
combination drug effect was assessed using Calcusyn software
(Version 2.0, Biosoft) to calculate combination indices (CI)
indicative of synergy (CI < 1), additivity (CI ¼ 1), or antagonism
(CI > 1).

In vivo drug treatments

þ

þ

AZD1480 and selumetinib were obtained from AstraZeneca
under a standard Materials Transfer Agreement. Structures of both
drugs are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Groups of 8 to 10 mice
were inoculated with 5  106 xenograft cells retrieved from
cryostorage, and engraftment monitored by weekly enumeration
of the proportion of human CD45
cells in the peripheral blood
þ
(%huCD45
; refs. 26, 27). Drug treatments were initiated when
the median %huCD45
exceeded 1% for each cohort. For single-
agent in vivo efﬁcacy testing, AZD1480 was administered by oral
gavage twice daily at 10 mg/kg for 5 days, followed by a single
daily dose of 15 mg/kg for 2 days. This cycle was repeated 3 times.
For the combination efﬁcacy study selumetinib (25 mg/kg) was
administered 3 hours before AZD1480 (30 mg/kg), and both
drugs were administered once daily by oral gavage Monday to
Friday for 2 weeks and were dissolved in 0.5% hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose and 1% Tween-80, with the pH adjusted to 3.0 for
AZD1480. A preliminary tolerability study on nonengrafted mice
had shown that this was the maximum tolerated dose and
schedule of the combined drugs.

Following randomization of mice and the initiation of drug
treatment, the %huCD45
was measured weekly. Individual
mouse event-free survival (EFS) was calculated as the day from
treatment initiation until the %hCD45
reached 25%. The EFS
was represented graphically by Kaplan–Meier analysis and
survival curves were compared by log-rank test. The efﬁcacy
of the drug treatment was evaluated by leukemia growth delay
(LGD), calculated as the difference between the median EFS of
the drug-treated cohort and the median EFS of the vehicle-
treated cohort. An objective response measure (ORM), mod-
eled after stringent clinical criteria, was assigned to individual
mice, which allowed the determination of a median group
response as described previously (25). Detailed methodology is
presented in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Table S2. Correlations between in vivo and in vitro drug sensi-
tivity were assessed by Spearman test. To evaluate interactions
between drugs in vivo, Therapeutic Enhancement was deﬁned as
the EFS of mice treated with the drug combination being
signiﬁcantly greater than both single agents used at
their
maximum tolerated doses (28, 29).

Analysis of protein expression

Methods for preparation of whole-cell extracts, determination
of protein concentrations, and analysis of cellular proteins by
immunoblotting have been described in detail elsewhere (30).
Antibody details can be provided upon request. Ba/F3TEL-JAK2–

In vivo pharmacodynamic analysis

þ

Mice were inoculated with PAMDRM xenograft cells, and
reached 25%. The following
monitored until the %hCD45
treatment was administered with three mice per group per time-
point: (i) vehicle control; (ii) one dose of AZD1480 (30 mg/kg);
(iii) one dose of selumetinib (25 mg/kg); and (iv) one dose of
selumetinib (25 mg/kg) 3 hours before one dose of AZD1480
(30 mg/kg). Spleen, peripheral blood (PB), and bone marrow
(BM) samples were collected at 2 and 9 hours post-AZD1480
treatment for phosphorylated protein analysis by immunoblot-
ting as described above.

Results
Development and characterization of xenografts derived from
JAK-mutated pediatric ALL biopsies

Of the original 21 bone marrow or peripheral blood biopsy
specimens inoculated from the P9906 study, 15 showed evidence
of engraftment in at least 2 mice using previously deﬁned criteria
(Table 1; ref. 27). This engraftment efﬁciency was lower than
expected (27), and closer inspection revealed a distinct relation-
ship between high CRLF2 expression and engraftment potential in
this subset of high-risk ALL samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
proportion of mice engrafted with CRLF2 high samples was
signiﬁcantly greater than CRLF2 normal samples (P ¼ 0.023).
Similarly, higher levels of spleen (P ¼ 0.036), peripheral blood
(P ¼ 0.043), and bone marrow (P ¼ 0.019) inﬁltration were
observed in the CRLF2 high compared with CRLF2 normal
xenografts. The gene expression proﬁles of spleen-derived cells
from primary xenografts of 37 mice representative of 13 patient
samples were then analyzed in relation to the original biopsy
(parental) specimen.

Supplementary Table S1 lists the 13 parent samples and their
corresponding xenografts analyzed at ﬁrst passage. In addition,
partial clinical information on the underlying lesions in the
parental sample is provided in Table 1. The lesions and muta-
tions of these parental samples have been previously charac-
terized and reported as part of a larger study by Roberts and
colleagues (6). Eleven of the 13 parents have CRLF2 lesions
(9 IGH-CRLF2 and 2 P2RY8-CRLF2) with all but one of these
(PALTWS) also having a JAK mutation. Each of the two cases
without a CRLF2 lesion has a different kinase-related lesion
(NUP214-ABL1 or IL7R mutation with SH2B3 deletion). Over-
all, eleven of the 13 parents also are considered Kinase-like on
the basis of their gene expression pattern. The two primary
leukemias that are not Kinase-like (PALNTB and PALTWS) both
have IGH–CRLF2 translocations.

Overall, the quality of the xenograft samples was much better
than the parent samples for scale factor and GAPDH expression:
median xenograft scale factor 6.0 v. 15.9 and median GAPDH
63,272 v. 49,762 for the xenografts and parents, respectively
(Supplementary Table S1). The median 3
ratios were compa-
rable for the parents and xenografts (1.2 and 1.3, respectively;
Supplementary Table S1). Despite the 5-year gap between ana-
lyzing the parent and xenograft samples, and the different lots of
materials, there appeared to be no obvious large differences in the
arrays. Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the distribution of expres-
sion levels for the 54,504 probe sets across all the parent samples

and xenografts. Overall, 89.7% of these intensities were less than
1,500 (3-fold baseline). For the purposes of comparing xenograft
expression to the parental lines, only those probe sets with
parental expression >1,500 (9,741 of 54,504 probe sets) were
evaluated, which permitted a minimum interpretation of 3-fold
higher or lower expression. There were 2,052 of 9,741 probesets
(21.1%) with expression levels >1,500 in all 13 of the parent
samples. Each of the 37 xenograft samples was compared with its
parent sample and the concordance of expression was evaluated.
The number of interpretable probe sets (expression >1,500) for
each of the 13 parent samples ranged from 3,911 to 5,671
(median 5,221; mean 5,127). Concordance of each of the xeno-
grafts was determined by whether the expression for these probe
sets in the xenografts was within three-fold of its parent expres-
sion. The overall frequency of xenograft expression within three-
fold of parental expression for the interpretable probe sets is
shown in Supplementary Table S3 and ranged from 74.2% to
95.0% (median 84.1%; mean 84.0%). Supplementary Table S3
also shows the R-squared (RSQ) results and slope for the corre-
lation between the intensities of parent samples with the xeno-
grafts. RSQ values ranged from 0.644 to 0.901 (median 0.831;
mean 0.820) and the slopes varied from 0.385 to 1.306 (median
0.835; mean 0.817).

We also explored the possibility that certain probe sets would
be uniquely associated with either the parent or xenograft mate-
rial. Probe sets were selected on the basis of the minimum
expression by type (either parent or xenograft) being higher than
the maximum expression of the alternative type. They were also
required to have the average expression for the higher expressing
category >1,500. Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 show the probe
sets identiﬁed by this approach. Only 20 probe sets were found in
which the expression of the parents was always higher than the
xenografts (Supplementary Table S4). A similar result was
obtained for probe sets in which the xenograft expression always
exceeded the parents (n ¼ 26, Supplementary Table S5). For the
most part, these probe sets were differentially expressed rather
than being completely on or off. The most noteworthy exceptions
are 217572_at and 231628_s_at. For these two probe sets the
parent samples had no detectable expression (baseline of 500),
whereas the average xenograft expression was 75,903 and 23,880,
respectively.

Given the emphasis on CRLF2 lesions (and underlying JAK
mutations) in the selection of the parents of the xenografts, we
also wanted to see how well the xenografts retained the
parental expression of CRLF2. Eleven of the 13 parental sam-
ples had CRLF2 lesions (9 with IGH-CRLF2 and 2 with P2RY8-
CRLF2) and originally showed high CRLF2 expression. All
xenografts for these 11 cases had expression levels >1,500 and
ranged from 0.58 to 3.31 times the parental intensity (median
1.28; mean 1.48).

In addition to the comparison of array data, qRT-PCR for a
panel of 24 genes that were previously shown to be differentially
expressed in a cohort of patients with ALL (2, 6) was also
performed (Fig. 1). Nearly all of the genes showed comparable
expression levels for their respective xenografts. The most notable
exception to this is sample PAKSWW, for which 3 xenografts are
shown. All 3 of the xenografts display nearly identical expression
levels, yet none of these retain the relatively high IGJ expression of
the parent. A heatmap of the microarray gene expression data is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, which corresponds to the qRT-
PCR data shown in Fig. 1.

Continuous xenografts have been established from 11 of the
15 primary xenografts following inoculation of spleen-derived
cells into secondary and tertiary recipient mice (Table 1). Spleen-
derived cells from these secondary and/or tertiary engrafted
mice were used in the experiments described below.

AZD1480 inhibits aberrant JAK/STAT signaling in JAK-mutated
xenografts

Because previous studies have shown that JAK mutations result
in aberrant signaling via the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT
pathways (2–5, 14, 31), we analyzed basal expression levels of key
phosphoproteins as a surrogate for pathway activation in the
xenograft panel. JAK-mutated xenografts exhibited increased sig-
naling in JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling relative to
xenografts ALL-25 and ALL-26, which have no annotated JAK
mutations, as shown by elevated levels of pJAK1, pJAK2, pSTAT1,
pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pMEK1/2, and pAKT (Fig. 2A). Elevated levels of
these phosphoproteins were not uniform across all JAK-mutated
xenografts.

The ability of AZD1480 to inhibit JAK/STAT signaling was
tested across three JAK-mutated xenografts (PAKHZT, PAKRSL,
and PALNTB) and compared with a xenograft harboring an
activating translocation in JAK2 (BCR-JAK2, PAKYEP), as well as
a xenograft with lesions in IL7R and SH2B3 (PALJDL). AZD1480
broadly decreased levels of pSTAT1/3/5 across the xenografts
(Fig. 2B).
In contrast, AZD1480 had minimal effects on
pMEK1/2 and pAKT levels in all xenografts with the exception
of PALJDL, which showed decreased levels of these phosphopro-
teins. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also reduced in 3 of 5
xenografts tested (PAKHZT, PAKRSL, and PALJDL).

AZD1480 exerts variable antileukemic efﬁcacy in vitro and
in vivo

To gain additional evidence for the use of JAK inhibitors such
as AZD1480 for the treatment of patients with JAK-mutated
ALL, we tested its in vitro and in vivo efﬁcacy against represen-
tative xenografts. The in vitro IC50 values for xenografts ranged
from 0.6–5.0 mmol/L for 5 xenografts, to >10 mmol/L for the
remaining 6 tested (Table 1; Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S5). The 5 most sensitive xenografts (PAKHZT, PAKSWW,
PAKYEP, PALJDL, and ALL-10JAK1/V658L),
including that
with BCR-JAK2 fusion (PAKYEP) and wild-type JAK (PALJDL),
did not appear to conform to any speciﬁc JAK mutational
status. Moreover, the differences in AZD1480 in vitro sensitivity
did not appear to relate to differential inhibition of the JAK/
STAT and MAPK signaling pathways, as described above and
in Fig. 2B.

When tested in vivo as a single-agent AZD1480 induced
signiﬁcant progression delays in 3 of 10 of the JAK-mutated
xenografts (Table 1; Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S6 and Sup-
plementary Fig. S6). Despite some evidence of activity in
delaying leukemia progression, AZD1480 was unable to elicit
objective responses (modeled after stringent clinical criteria) in
any of the xenografts regardless of their JAK status (all were
scored as Progressive Disease, PD1 or PD2). A complete sum-
mary of results is provided in Table 1, Supplementary Tables S6
and S9, including total numbers of mice, number of mice that
died (or were otherwise excluded), numbers of mice that
reached event, average time to event, LGD values, as well as
numbers in each of the ORM categories and median ORM
values.

Expression of candidate genes in xenografts and parent samples. qRT-PCR DCt data for parental samples and representative xenografts are shown for
24 selected genes. The color scale spans a 1,024-fold range of expression with each unit representing a doubling in intensity. At the high end of the scale, the
darkest red indicates expression at the same level as EEF2 (the control gene, DCt ¼ 0), while the darkest blue denotes expression at least 10-doublings
lower (DCt ¼ 10). The minimum expression value for any gene is 10. Numbers above columns refer to unique xenograft identiﬁers, and correspond to
those listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S3. P, parental sample.

Rational targeting of the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to
achieve synergistic antileukemic efﬁcacy

Because of

the modest single-agent activity exhibited by
AZD1480 in vitro and in vivo, we investigated the potential for
combination with other pathway inhibitors. As JAK-mutated ALL
cells and JAK wild-type with a Kinase-like signature exhibited
aberrant JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling (Fig. 2A and B), but
modest inhibition of MAPK signaling by AZD1480 alone (Fig.
2B), we tested the combination of AZD1480 with selumetinib.
Fixed ratio in vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that the AZD1480/
selumetinib combination exerted strong to very strong synergistic
effects in 4 of 5 JAK-mutated ALLs (PAKRSL, PALJCF, PALLSD, and
PAMDRM; average CI values < 0.14; Fig. 4A–D and J, Supple-
mentary Table S7). Synergism and moderate synergism were also
observed with ALL-10JAK1/V658L (CI ¼ 0.34) and PALJDL (CI ¼
0.73), respectively (Fig. 4E and I and Supplementary Table S7). In
contrast, antagonism was observed for ALL-4, ALL-19 and ALL-26
(CI values > 1; Fig. 4F–H and J and Supplementary Table S7).
Signiﬁcantly greater synergy between AZD1480 and selumetinib
was observed in the JAK-mutated compared with the JAK wild-
type xenografts (P ¼ 0.036; Fig. 4K). Of note, selumetinib alone
exhibited poor single-agent activity against all xenografts tested
(IC50 >10 mmol/L; Fig. 4A–I), regardless of their JAK mutational
status.

The combined effects of AZD1480 and selumetinib were also
assessed by phosphoprotein analysis of
the PALLSD and
PAMDRM xenografts. Consistent with the results presented
in Fig. 2B, AZD1480 alone markedly decreased STAT1/3/5 phos-
phorylation (Fig. 4L and M). Selumetinib alone exerted minimal
effects on levels of phosphorylated STATs, but substantially
decreased pERK1/2 levels in both xenografts. Reduced levels of
pSTAT1/3/5 and pERK1/2 were maintained or even enhanced
with combination treatment for up to 24 hours in both xenografts.
Minimal changes in pAKT were observed throughout the 24-hour
treatment period for both xenografts.

Because of the strong synergy observed between AZD1480 and
selumetinib against JAK-mutated xenografts in vitro, the combi-
nation was tested in vivo against xenografts PALLSD and
PAMDRM, which both exhibited very strong synergism in vitro
(Supplementary Table S7). Although AZD1480 alone delayed the
progression of PAMDRM by 10 days, it did not delay the leukemia
progression of PALLSD with both responses categorized as PD1
(Fig. 5A and B, Table 1; Supplementary Tables S8–S9). Selume-
tinib alone exerted no signiﬁcant antileukemic efﬁcacy against
either xenograft. Despite the combination of AZD1480 and
selumetinib exerting a signiﬁcant progression delay in PAMDRM
in comparison with vehicle-treated control and selumetinib
alone, no objective responses or Therapeutic Enhancement were

Pharmacodynamic evaluation of AZD1480 and selumetinib in
leukemia-engrafted mice

In an effort to understand our inability to translate the pro-
found in vitro synergistic interactions between AZD1480 and
selumetinib to the in vivo setting, we evaluated signaling pathways
by phosphoprotein immunoblots of PAMDRM cells harvested
from the spleens of highly engrafted mice following drug treat-
ment. Although both drugs alone and in combination profoundly
reduced pSTAT1/3/5, and pERK1/2 levels at 2 hours after treat-
ment (Fig. 5C), all had recovered to control levels by 9 hours.
Moreover, although pAKT levels were not affected at 2 hours after
treatment,
they had increased markedly at 9 hours in the
AZD1480 and combination-treated mice relative to control levels.
Subsequent reassessment of the in vitro combination cytotoxicity
assays revealed that, whereas the length of drug exposure did not
substantially affect the activity of the single agents, the profound
synergy observed between AZD1480 and selumetinib against
PALLSD and PAMDRM required continuous drug exposures in
excess of 12 hours (Supplementary Fig. S7). Moreover, 72-hour
exposure of PAMDRM cells to the AZD1480/selumetinib combi-
nation resulted in a greater repression of pSTAT1/3/5, pAKT, and
pERK compared with cells only treated for 12 hours (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S8), further supporting the requirement for prolonged
pathway inhibition to achieve synergistic cytotoxicity.

Discussion

Patient-derived xenografts are increasingly recognized as
important tools for understanding tumor biology and optimizing
new treatments. This study describes the development and molec-

ular characterization of a large panel of xenografts derived from a
cohort of high-risk patients with Kinase-like gene expression
signatures, most of which harbor JAK mutations. The concordance
in gene expression proﬁles between xenografts and parent biop-
sies is remarkable, considering the number of uncontrollable
variables associated with analysis of the batches of samples several
years apart, indicating that these xenografts provide a valuable
resource for preclinical experimental therapeutics.

Previous reports have identiﬁed dysregulation of multiple key
signaling pathways in Kinase-like ALL (6, 13), while Tasian and
colleagues reported that both JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR path-
ways are activated in CRLF2-rearranged BCP-ALL (9). The JAK-
mutated ALL xenografts established in this study also exhibited
constitutive activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT path-
ways in contrast to BCP-ALL xenografts. Thus, the expectation was
that pharmacologic inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway with
AZD1480 in JAK-mutated xenografts would result in substantial
in vitro and in vivo antileukemic efﬁcacy. However, despite evi-
dence that AZD1480 inhibited JAK/STAT signaling both in vitro
and in vivo, it exerted modest antileukemia efﬁcacy and signiﬁ-
cantly delayed the progression of only 3 of 10 xenografts in vivo.
With the exception of one xenograft with BCR-JAK2 fusion
(PAKYEP) and one xenograft with JAK wild-type (PALJDL), the
extent of leukemia progression is consistent with that reported for
the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib against JAK-mutated ALL xeno-
grafts (6, 23). Previously, signiﬁcant decreases in leukemia burden
were observed when mice engrafted with PAKYEP and PALJDL
were treated with ruxolitinib (23). One possible explanation for
the difference in efﬁcacy between the two studies is that ruxoli-
tinib was administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion,
while we administered AZD1480 by oral gavage once or twice
daily. As demonstrated in this study, the inhibitory effects of
10 mg/kg AZD1480 lasted between 2 and 9 hours in vivo.

Therefore, the lack of any observed objective responses in the
current study when stringent objective response criteria developed
by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (25) were applied
indicates that prolonged target inhibition is likely to be required
to achieve signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt. Furthermore, the appar-
ent increased sensitivity of xenografts PAKYEP and PALJDL to
both ruxolitinib and AZD1480 in vivo suggests that Kinase-like
ALL cells with normal CRLF2 expression are more dependent on
the JAK/STAT pathway than those with JAK point mutations and
high CRLF2 expression.

Recent reports have highlighted compensatory activation of
signaling pathways in response to inhibition of a single kinase
node, and the successful targeting of dual pathways to achieve
therapeutic synergy (32–34). Therefore, we explored dual inhi-
bition of the JAK/STAT and MEK pathways in JAK-mutated ALL
xenografts to improve the in vitro and in vivo antileukemic efﬁcacy
of a JAK inhibitor when used alone. We observed potent syner-
gistic cell killing in vitro with the AZD1480/selumetinib combi-
nation at submicromolar concentrations, suggesting that both the
JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways are critical for the survival of

JAK-mutated ALL. There was also evidence for selectivity in this
synergy against JAK-mutated/Kinase-like xenografts, as synergy
was not observed in 4 xenografts with wild-type JAK (Fig. 4J).
However, despite the AZD1480/selumetinib combination signif-
icantly delaying the progression of one JAK-mutated xenograft,
no objective responses were achieved. These results, along with
our additional in vitro combination cytotoxicity experiments and
pharmacodynamics study, suggest that prolonged pathway inhi-
bition is required in order to achieve synergy between AZD1480
and selumetinib.

The plasma half-life (t1/2) of AZD1480 was approximately 2
and 5 hours in mouse models (21) and humans (35), respectively.
However, whereas the human study showed maximal pSTAT
inhibition in circulating granulocytes at 1 to 2 hours postadmi-
nistration (35), a murine Ba/F3 TEL-JAK2 model showed pro-
longed pSTAT5 inhibition for up to 12 hours in spleen-derived
cells upon administration of a 30 mg/kg dose, consistent
with signiﬁcant in vivo antileukemic efﬁcacy (21). In the same
study, pSTAT5 suppression was observed to a maximum of 8
hours at the 10 mg/kg dose, consistent with our ﬁndings. The t1/2

of selumetinib in humans was a median of 8.3 hours (36), and
increased with increasing dose, while sustained inhibition of
pERK was observed in circulating lymphocytes from patients
treated on a prolonged twice daily dosing regimen. The rapid
plasma clearance of AZD1480 and selumetinib, along with our
inability to coadminister the higher doses more frequently than
once daily due to toxicity issues, are likely to have signiﬁcantly
contributed to our failure to translate their impressive in vitro
synergy to the in vivo setting.

Inhibition of the MAPK pathway results in activation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway in breast cancer cells (32, 33), and the com-
bination of MEK and mTOR inhibitors exerted synergistic anti-
cancer activity both in vitro and in vivo (33). However, given the
difﬁculty we experienced in optimizing a tolerable combination
schedule of AZD1480 and selumetinib in NOD/SCID mice, it was
not possible to include an mTOR inhibitor in our in vivo combi-

nation studies. As CRLF2 is capable of activating the JAK/STAT,
MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways (5–10), and given the current
problems associated with the therapeutic use of small-molecule
JAK inhibitors (37), CRLF2 may represent a more promising target
for drug development in the treatment of JAK-mutated/CRLF2-
rearranged ALL, although such inhibitors remain to be developed
and tested in the preclinical setting.

Despite the disappointing outcome of our efﬁcacy experiments
testing the in vivo combination of AZD1480 and selumetinib,
other JAK inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of JAK-
mutated ALL. Although the clinical development of AZD1480
has recently been halted due to dose-limiting toxicities (35), our
data clearly demonstrate that AZD1480 was able to inhibit its
target in vivo, albeit brieﬂy. Other JAK inhibitors such as ruxoli-
tinib, TGT101348, and CYT387 have demonstrated clinical safety
and efﬁcacy in other malignancies (16, 17, 38), and ruxolitinib in

particular was efﬁcacious against preclinical models of pediatric
JAK-mutated ALL (23, 39). Thus, alternative JAK inhibitors,
when used under conditions that can achieve prolonged target
inhibition, may yet be efﬁcacious in the treatment of JAK-
mutated ALL.

In summary, this study has detailed the development and
molecular characterization of a panel of patient-derived xeno-
grafts from Kinase-like/JAK-mutated pediatric ALL. These xeno-
grafts exhibited dysregulated activation of multiple signaling
pathways, consistent with the primary disease, indicating that
they provide a highly relevant preclinical experimental model.
Despite strong evidence of target inhibition, a small-molecule
JAK1/2 inhibitor exhibited modest in vitro and in vivo antileu-
kemic efﬁcacy against these xenografts,
leading to rational
targeting of dual signaling nodes that resulted in profound in
vitro drug synergy. Translation of these synergistic drug inter-
actions to the in vivo setting, however, appeared to require
sustained target inhibition that was not achievable using tol-
erable drug dosing and administration schedules in experimen-
tal mouse models.
