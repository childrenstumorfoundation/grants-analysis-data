RAS/MEK–Independent Gene Expression Reveals BMP2-
Related Malignant Phenotypes in the Nf1-Deﬁcient MPNST

Abstract

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that occurs in carriers of
germline mutations in Nf1 gene as well as sporadically. Neuroﬁbromin, encoded by the Nf1 gene, functions as a
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) whose mutation leads to activation of wt-RAS and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling in neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) patients' tumors. However, therapeutic targeting of
RAS and MAPK have had limited success in this disease. In this study, we modulated NRAS, mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK)1/2, and neuroﬁbromin levels in MPNST cells and determined
gene expression changes to evaluate the regulation of signaling pathways in MPNST cells. Gene expression changes
due to neuroﬁbromin modulation but independent of NRAS and MEK1/2 regulation in MPNST cells indicated
bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) signaling as a key pathway. The BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway was activated
in NF1-associated MPNST cells and inhibition of BMP2 signaling by LDN-193189 or short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) to BMP2 decreased the motility and invasion of NF1-associated MPNST cells. The pathway-speciﬁc gene
changes provide a greater understanding of the complex role of neuroﬁbromin in MPNST pathology and novel
targets for drug discovery. Mol Cancer Res; 11(6); 616–27. Ó2013 AACR.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is a single gene mutation-
related disorder with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births. It is
well known that the loss-of-function of neuroﬁbromin, a
250 kD Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) encoded by
Nf1 gene, leads to hyperactive RAS activity and an increase of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signal-
ing in the patients' cells (1, 2). Typical manifestations of an
Nf1 deﬁciency include benign dermal neuroﬁbromas and
plexiform neuroﬁbromas, the latter are located deeply within
the peripheral nervous system. In 8% to 13% of NF1
patients, the benign plexiform neuroﬁbromas develop into
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), usu-
ally with a poor prognosis and high mortality (3). Up to 50%
of the MPNSTs occur in the context of an Nf1 genetic

disease (4, 5) and the remainder, with a functional wt-Nf1,
occurs sporadically. NF1-associated MPNST is generally
believed to arise from the precursor Schwann cells promoted
by the Nf1 heterozygous microenvironment (6, 7). The
success of the primary treatment, surgery, is limited by
tumor invasion leading to high relapse rates. RAS–MEK–
ERK–targeted therapeutic strategies have met with limited
success (8). Discoveries of signal transduction downstream
of RAS and of MEK-ERK pathways speciﬁc to NF1 disease,
or pathways independent of RAS–MEK–ERK could provide
new targets for therapeutic purposes (9).

Gene expression studies by microarray have been used to
identify the gene signatures associated with MPNSTs. Lee
and colleagues ﬁrst applied the cDNA microarray of 4,608
probes to the comparison of T265 cells, an Nf1-deﬁcient cell
line, with normal human Schwann cells (HSC) and iden-
tiﬁed 955 differentially expressed genes (10). Watson and
colleagues tested primary human NF1-associated and spo-
radic MPNST samples by using oligonucleotide microarrays
representing 8,100 unique human genes but failed to deﬁne
a reliable molecular signature to distinguish sporadic and
NF1-associated MPNST tissue samples (11). Miller and
colleagues compared 8 MPNST cell lines with normal HSCs
and identiﬁed a 159-gene signature that separated these 2
groups (12). Research from this group then compared
primary human samples from several subtypes of neuroﬁ-
bromas and MPNSTs, and the results indicated that the
overexpressed gene Sox9 may serve as a biomarker of survival
factor in NF1-related MPNSTs (13). Although these studies
have provided enormous data on gene expression changes in
MPNSTs, however, the evaluation of drug targets related to

neuroﬁbromin deﬁciency or RAS–MEK signaling was not
shown.

We designed systematic study of comparisons of the gene
expression changes associated with neuroﬁbromin and its
major downstream signaling pathways. In brief, genes reg-
ulated by NRAS, the predominant RAS protein in MPNST
cell lines (1), were identiﬁed by siRNA interference, and the
signal–regulated
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular
kinase (MEK)1/2–related genes were characterized by
U0126 inhibition in ST88-14 cell line, which is derived
from patient with NF1 with mutated neuroﬁbromin (14–
16). Neuroﬁbromin-associated gene changes were ﬁrst char-
acterized by gene proﬁle comparison between ST88-14 and
normal HSCs, and further reﬁned by neuroﬁbromin knock-
down in STS26T, a sporadic MPNST cell line with the
functional, wild-type neuroﬁbromin (17, 18). Using inter-
section analysis of gene expression proﬁles under these
scenarios, alterations in gene regulation exerted by the
neuroﬁbromin-regulated pathways were determined. This
strategy enabled us to identify genes related to neuroﬁbro-
min deﬁciency but independent of NRAS and MEK1/2
pathways in MPNSTs, with the potential to provide previ-
ously unknown mechanisms
leading to NF1-related
malignancy.

We identiﬁed bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)
expression as neuroﬁbromin-regulated but independent of
NRAS and MEK1/2. BMP2 belongs to the TGF-b super-
family, and it functions as a morphogen required for the
development of lung, heart, and central nerve system. Over-
expression of BMP2 has been found in many different types
of tumors including gliomas, melanomas, breast cancer, and
ﬁbrosarcomas (19–21), and it promotes malignancy-related
attributes such as migration and invasion of these tumors
(20, 22, 23). We found that inhibition of BMP2 signaling by
LDN-193189 or BMP2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
decreased the motility and invasion of Nf1-deﬁcient
MPNST cells in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemicals treatment

Human MPNST ST88-14 cell line (a generous gift from
T. Glover, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and
STS26T cell line (a generous gift from D. Scoles, Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA) were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5%
FBS (Hyclone Laboratories). T265 cell line (a generous gift
from G. De Vries, Hines VA Hospital, Hines, IL) was
cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM;
Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS. sNF96.2 and
sNF02.2 cell lines were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM medium sup-
plemented with 10% FBS. Primary normal HSCs HSC291,
HSC361, and HSC338 (generous gifts from Patrick M.
Wood, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,
Miami, FL) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemen-
ted with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L forskolin, and 10 nmol/L
heregulin. All cell lines were checked periodically for Myco-

RAS–MEK Independent Malignancy in MPNST

plasma with Venor GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Sig-
ma-Aldrich). Cultures were propagated for no more than 3
months. To inhibit MAPK activity, 10 mmol/L U0126
(CalBiochem) was applied to the ST88-14 preseeded in
10-cm plate for 18 hours before harvest for mRNA. Parallel
cultures for each RNA preparation were used for concurrent
controls to show inhibition of the relevant pathway.

siRNA gene knockdown

Human Nf1 siRNA (siNf1), NRas siRNA (siNRas), con-
trol siRNA, and siRNA Transfection Reagent (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. STS26T cells were plated at 1.5  105 cells per
10-cm plate 24 hours before transfection. Four microliter of
siRNA (30 nmol/L) and 4 mL of siRNA transfection
reagent, each diluted in 400 mL of Optimem (Invitrogen),
were combined and after a 30-minute incubation added to
the 3.2 mL of OptiMem in each plate. The same amount of
scrambled control siRNA was used as control. Following 6
hours incubation of cells with the transfection solution, the
medium was replaced by growth medium. Cells were har-
vested 48 hours later. For ST88-14, similar protocols were
used for NRAS knockdown. As stated earlier parallel cultures
for each RNA preparation were used for concurrent controls
to show knockdown of the relevant targets.

Western blots analysis

Cells grown from 30% to 80% conﬂuence were washed
with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and then were lysed with radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mmol/L
NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1%
SDS; 50 mmol/L Tris–Cl; pH 8.0) supplemented with
2% protease inhibitor cocktail, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl-
ﬂuoride (PMSF; from stock at 10 mg/mL in methanol), 1
mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L Na4P2O7.10H2O, and 1
mmol/L NaF. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to
IRdye infrared dyes (Rockland). The protein bands were
detected and quantiﬁed using the Odyssey infrared imaging
system and software (Licor Biosciences).

The antibodies used in these experiments were rabbit
polyclonal antineuroﬁbromin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
goat polyclonal anti-NRAS (Abcam), mouse monoclonal
anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and total extracellular signal–regu-
lated kinase (ERK)1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal
anti-ERK1,2 (Cell Signaling), mouse monoclonal anti-
a-tubulin
anti-
SMAD1/5/8 (Cell signaling), and mouse polyclonal anti-
total SMAD1/5/8 (Abcam). Neuroﬁbromin were run on
8%, ERK1/2 and SMAD1/5/8 on 10%, and NRAS on 15%
SDS-PAGE, respectively. Eighty microgram of protein
lysate was loaded in each well, and nitrocellulose transfer
membrane (Protran, Whatmann GmbH) was used for
protein transfer.

an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Labeled targets were synthe-
sized from the puriﬁed RNA using linear ampliﬁcation and
indirect labeling by incorporation of aminoallyl-labeled
nucleotide with the TargetAmp one-round aminoallyl-
aRNA ampliﬁcation kit 101 (Epicentre Technologies),
which was subsequently modiﬁed by the covalent addition
of Alexa dye (Epicentre Technologies).
Agilent whole human genome 4  44 K 2 color micro-
array platform was used to characterize the gene proﬁle,
which covered more than 41,000 genes and transcripts of
human genome. Three independent replicates of each RNA
preparations were isolated on different occasions to account
for biologic variation. Probe intensities were normalized by
Lowess normalization and differential gene expression was
determined using the "limma" package in Bioconductor in
an R environment. Differentially expressed genes for path-
way analysis were determined by adjusted P value less than
0.01 and fold change (upregulated or downregulated) more
than 1.5 for most of the comparisons. In the comparison
between ST88-14 and normal HSCs, many differential
expressed genes were identiﬁed. We increased the stringency
for this comparison by lifting the adjusted P value threshold
to less than 1  10
 6, and ﬁnal numbers of differentially
expressed genes are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Around 60 genes were chosen to verify the microarray results
by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and approximately 97% were
conﬁrmed. The veriﬁed list of genes and primers are provided
in Supplementary Table S5. The raw data of the microarray
were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus as GSE39764.

Gene Ontology and pathway analysis

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity
System, http://www.ingenuity.com) and Genomatix soft-
ware suite (http://www.genomatix.de/) were used in the
gene function enrichment and pathway analysis. Generally,
gene ofﬁcial names with fold-change data from different
datasets were used as input. Each software package can
generate the signiﬁcant biologic terms or pathways based
on the classic knowledge and latest literatures. All the
analyses were conducted following the manufacture instruc-
tions and default settings.

Quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR green I

Three batches of independent total RNA from the same
preparations used for microarray were reverse transcribed by
SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). ABI
7500 Sequence Detection System was used to determine the
relative quantity of a speciﬁc gene in the cDNA template.
Primer sequences for validation are shown in Supplementary
Table S5.

Lentivirus shRNA-mediated stable NRas knockdown
and inducible oncogenic RAS expression system

MPNST cell lines targeted for stable gene knockdown or
using a nonsilencing sequence were constructed by lentivirus
based shRNA technology. The lentivirus vector containing
shRNAs targeting NRAS and scrambled sequence were
packaged using the Trans-Lentiviral Packaging System

(TLP4615, Open Biosystem, Thermo) in 293T cells. The
virus particles were harvested and titered according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The ST88-14 cells were incubated
with viral particles for 4 hours and selected by 0.5 mg/mL
puromycin for 5 days. Drug-selected pooled cells were
conﬁrmed to be virally infected by ﬂuorescence microscopy
for GFP expression and further veriﬁed by qPCR.

Tet-off (BD Biosciences) cell line conditionally expressing
the oncogenic form of RAS-G12V was established using the
parent Schwann cell
line STS26T. The procedure is
described in a previous study [Kraniak and colleagues 18].

Scratch recovery cell migration assay
Cells were seeded at 1  106 cells per well in 6-well plates
and preincubated with LDN-193189 at the same concen-
trations used in the scratch experiment overnight. The
scratch was made on 100% conﬂuent cell monolayer by a
plastic tip. To quantify the cell migration images, we used
T265 and ST88-14 infected by the GFP-expressed lentivirus
to create T265NonKD and ST88NonKD cell
lines.
T265NonKD cells were cultured at 0.1% or 5% FBS with
0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mmol/L LDN-193189. Because
ST88NonKD survived poorly with 0.1% FBS, 1% FBS was
used in those experiments. ST88NonKD cells were cultured
at 1% and 5% FBS with same LDN-193189 concentration
series. Cell migration was monitored after 24 hours of cell
culture by Olympus IX71 ﬂuorescent microscope, and the
area of the scratched region (the dark gap) was quantiﬁed in
terms of the number of pixels by slidebook 4.2 (Olympus).
The more cells that migrated to the area, the less was number
of pixels in the dark gap. This assay was repeated at least 3
independent occasions under each of the conditions.

Matrigel invasion assay

BD BioCoat Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel invasion
Chamber was used to access the invasion ability of the ST88-
14 and T265. Brieﬂy, 2.5  104 cells were added to the
upper chamber coated by Matrigel without serum but with
the BMP2 and/or LDN-193189. Cells were stimulated by
200 ng/mL BMP2 for 24 hours in the chamber before
evaluation. Cells with LDN-193189 were pretreated with
0.1 mmol/L LDN-193189 overnight before seeding to the
chambers, and the medium was changed to fresh 0.1 mmol/L
LDN-193189 with/without BMP2 200 ng/mL for 24 hours
for evaluation. Five percent FBS was used as attractant in the
lower chamber. After 24 hours, the cells remaining in the
chamber were removed by the cotton swab and invaded cells
present on the other side of the bottom of chamber were
ﬁxed and stained by Diff-Quick Stain (Biochemical Science,
Inc.). The invaded cells were counted under a microscope
and all experiments were repeated 3 times following the
manufacturer's instructions.

Statistics analysis

Experiments were subject to at least 3 independent repli-
cates. For qPCR and scratch assay results, paired t test was
used to determine the signiﬁcant differences at 95% or 99%
conﬁdence interval.

Results
Pathway intervention and intersection analysis scheme in
MPNST cell lines

To characterize neuroﬁbromin-dependent gene expres-
sion, we applied pathway-speciﬁc interventions. Using
chemical and genetic pathway interference in ST88-14 cells,
we identiﬁed gene expression proﬁles related to MEK1/2
and NRAS. The comparison between ST88-14 and normal
HSCs was used to capture the gene space deregulated during
tumorigenesis after loss of the Nf1 gene in ST88-14 cells.
Gene expression changes speciﬁc to an Nf1 deﬁciency were
determined by siRNA interference to Nf1 gene in STS26T, a
sporadic MPNST cell line with functional neuroﬁbromin.
Using Agilent whole human genome 4  44 K 2 color
microarrays, we investigated neuroﬁbromin, NRAS, and
MEK1/2-related gene expression proﬁles.

The differentially expressed gene changes were deﬁned as

the following datasets (DS):

DS-1) siRNA-targeted knockdown of human Nf1 (vs. a

scrambled control siRNA) in STS26T was conducted
to distinguish the gene changes speciﬁc to anNf1
deﬁciency.

DS-2) siRNA-targeted knockdown of human NRas (vs. a
scrambled control siRNA) in ST88-14 was conducted
to identify NRas knockdown-associated gene changes.
DS-3) Administration of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (vs.

DMSO control) to ST88-14 to identify MEK1/2
pathway–inﬂuenced genes.

DS-4) Comparison of ST88-14 versus normal HSC to

identify gene expression changes associated with an
Nf1-related tumorigenesis.

The number of differently expressed genes for each
comparison are summarized in Supplementary Table S1
and the gene lists of all the datasets are presented in
Supplementary Table S2.

In ST88-14 cells, the siNRas decreased expression of
NRAS at the protein level by approximately 60% and
decreased phosphorylated ERK1/2 by approximately 50%,
conﬁrming that hyperactive NRAS is a strong upstream
signal activating the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 pathway in ST88-
14 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). U0126, an inhibitor of
MEK1/2 in NF1-associated MPNST cells (1, 18), reduced
the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 by approximately 90%
after 18 hours treatment at 10 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). In the sporadic MPNST cell line STS26T, siNf1 the
knockdown efﬁciency after 48 hours was approximately 90%
at the protein level compared with the scrambled control
siRNA treated (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Phosphorylated
ERK1/2 increased by 1.6-fold in siNf1-treated STS26T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C), and the transcription factor
activity of activator protein 1 (AP1) increased as observed
in our previous study (18), indicating that the neuroﬁbro-
min–NRAS–MEK1/2 axis was functional in STS26T cells.
The differentially expressed gene lists from each compar-
ison provided the basis for the intersection analysis of the
gene expression proﬁles. The overlapping genes were then

RAS–MEK Independent Malignancy in MPNST

classiﬁed into cell signaling axes based on their patterns of
change as deﬁned in Table 1. For example, given that
MEK1/2 is downstream of NRAS, if a gene is upregulated
when NRAS is inhibited, and is also upregulated when
MEK1/2 is inhibited, the regulation of this gene was consid-
ered to be under the control of NRAS–MEK1/2 axis meaning
that the suppressed NRAS may upregulate that gene through
the decreased activity of MEK1/2. With such reasoning bas-
ed on the biologic pathways, we associated the overlapping
genes to the speciﬁc signaling axes, and deﬁned the neuroﬁ-
bromin-related but NRAS and MEK1/2 independent genes.

Intersection analysis reveals the pathway related
potential drug targets in ST88-14 cells

As we expected, in ST88-14 cell line, when comparing the
lists of genes from any 2 of 3 experimental conditions (ST88-
14 vs. HSC, siNRas vs. control, and U0126 vs. DMSO), we
found a substantial number of shared genes (Table 1). This
showed that our methods of inhibition, siNRas and U0126,
were functionally consistent. When comparing ST88-14 and
HSC, the differentially expressed genes were large probably
due to the process of tumorigenesis along with those regu-
lated by the loss of wild-type neuroﬁbromin. We used Nf1
knockdown in STS26T cells to delineate those changes in
gene expression speciﬁc to the neuroﬁbromin deﬁciency
rather than those simply associated with tumorigenesis.

The loss-of-function of neuroﬁbromin and hyperactive
NRAS have been characterized in ST88-14 cells (1, 18). To
identify speciﬁc targets of neuroﬁbromin–NRAS axis (DS-
5), we deﬁned 2 patterns of gene expression change in the
comparisons of ST88-14 versus HSC (DS-4) and siNRas
versus scrambled control (DS-2): (i) gene expression upre-
gulated in DS-4 but downregulated in DS-2, or (ii) down-
regulated in DS-4 but upregulated in DS-2 (Table 1; DS-5 in
Supplementary Table S2). Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) program by Genomatix Pathway System (GePS;
ref. 24) revealed that Gene Ontology (GO) terms in biologic
process such as "positive regulation of heart contraction"
including genes Adm and Tpm1 and
(GO: 0045823),
"cellular component morphogenesis" (GO: 0032989),
including genes Adm, Met, Ptprz1, Tpm1, and Smad3 were
signiﬁcantly enriched (Supplementary Table S3). Another
interesting gene revealed in these patterns was Rgs16, which
can activate the GTPase of G-protein a unit so as to inhibit
the signal transduction through G-protein coupled recep-
tors. RGS16 expression in ST88-14 decreased by 5.6-fold
compared with the normal Schwann cells and increased by
about 2-fold in the siNRas treated compared with the
scramble control siRNA treated. This pattern suggested
Rgs16 expression was regulated by neuroﬁbromin–NRAS
and negatively associated with the increased NRAS activity.
Considering the complex signaling downstream of G-pro-
tein subunits including ERK1/2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), and adenylate cyclases, the downregulation of Rgs16
by increased NRAS could serve as another strong enhancer
in MPNST tumorigenesis. The loss of Rgs16 has been
reported in some breast cancers, which facilitated the PI3K
signaling (25).

Gene expression that increased in ST88-14 compared
with HSC in DS-4 and decreased in the U0126-treated cells
compared with DMSO treated in DS-3, or alternately
decreased in DS-4 but increased DS-3, could be the regu-
latory targets of neuroﬁbromin–MEK1/2 axis (Table 1; DS-
6 in Supplementary Table S2). GSEA indicated that ontol-
ogy terms such as "cell cycle" (GO: 0007049; P ¼ 7.65e-8),
"cell-cycle arrest" (GO: 0007050; P ¼ 3.49e-7) and "reg-
ulation of serine/threonine kinase activity" (GO: 0071900;
P ¼ 3.48e-4) were among the most signiﬁcant terms. These
biologic process terms were consistent with the ERK1/2
suppression related cell-cycle arrest (26) and inhibitory
effects of U0126 on MEK1/2 (1), indicating that deregu-
lation of these processes occurred after defects of neuroﬁ-
bromin–MEK1/2 in MPNSTs. Sox9, which was present in
DS-6, has been reported as a biomarker in MPNSTs because
of its overexpression in NF1-related malignancies and its role
in the tumor survival (13). Our data conﬁrmed that the Sox9
expression was higher in ST88-14 compared with HSC and
that Sox9 expression can be downregulated by U0126. In
addition, Sox9 expression did not change in the siNRas-
treated samples, which indicated a possible mechanism in
which Sox9 expression was regulated through neuroﬁbro-
min–MEK1/2 but not by NRAS in ST88-14 cells.

In DS-6, we observed Edn1 (endothelin 1) to be strongly
inhibited by U0126, indicating that the MEK1/2 signaling
was prominent in its regulation. Results from Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) identiﬁed that among the genes
previously reported to be regulated by EDN1, mRNA
expression of 8 genes was positively associated with mRNA
level of Edn1 in DS-6, consistent with literature supported
trend of change, including Apln, Cdc25a, Egfr, Errﬁ1, Fst,
Il8, Mmp9, and Ptger4 (Supplementary Table S4). EDN1 is

a secreted protein with multiple physiologic effects on
cellular development, differentiation, vasoconstriction, and
mitogenesis (27) and it may be an important effector under
the regulation of neuroﬁbromin–MEK1/2 axis during devel-
opment and tumorigenesis.

Comparing DS-2 (siNRas vs. control) and DS-3 (U0126
vs. DMSO), genes both upregulated or both downregulated
in the 2 different datasets were identiﬁed as under the control
of NRAS–MEK1/2 axis (Table 1; DS-7 in Supplementary
-nucleotidase (NT5E) that converts AMP
Table S2). Ecto-5
to adenosine was downregulated in both datasets, and
Sunaga and colleagues reported that NT5E was downregu-
lated in non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) lines with
KRAS knockdown (28). NT5E has also been associated with
cell cycle and apoptosis in breast cancer, arterial calciﬁca-
tions, and immunodeﬁciency diseases (29–31). Our study
indicated its expression was positively controlled by NRAS–
MEK1/2 axis in ST88-14 cells.

Identiﬁcation of neuroﬁbromin-related gene expression
changes independent of NRAS and MEK1/2 pathways in
MPNST cells

For the 3 comparative scenarios involving ST88-14 cells
(Fig. 1), removal from DS-4 of the genes that overlapped
with DS-2 and with DS-3 enabled us to identify those genes
that were independent of the NRAS and MEK1/2 pathways,
namely DS-9 (Fig. 1; Table 1; and DS-9 in Supplementary
Table S2). We then created a dataset of genes directly
associated with Nf1-inhibition using siRNA as compared
with scrambled control siRNA in STS26T cells (DS-1). By
overlapping DS-9 with DS-1, we identiﬁed 142 unique
genes that were downregulated and 73 unique genes that
were upregulated in both DS-1 and DS-9 (Supplementary

Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). We considered these
genes, DS-10, to be under the regulation of neuroﬁbromin,
but independent of the NRAS and MEK1/2 pathway.
For the upregulated changes, GSEA revealed that GO
term "RAS GTPase binding" (GO: 0017016; P ¼ 4.70e-4)
including Dock4, Myo5b, Srgap1, and Als2 indicated mul-
tiple regulatory mechanisms of activated RAS after loss-of-
function of Nf1. The GO term "SMAD signal transduction"
(GO: 0060395; P ¼ 1.16e-3) including Hipk2 and Bmp2
was signiﬁcant (Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the
signiﬁcance of "signaling by BMP2" was reported by path-
way analysis of GePS as well, which drew our attention to the
aberrant expression of Bmp2 in Nf1-deﬁcient MPNSTs.

Bmp2 overexpression is independent of NRAS and
MEK1/2 in MPNSTs but related to neuroﬁbromin
function

As members of TGF-b superfamily, BMPs play various
roles in morphogenesis and homeostasis in many tissue types
during the development. Recent studies have indicated a role
for BMPs in molecular processes associated with different
human cancers (32). Interestingly, we also found Bmp2 as
one of 2,827 differentially expressed transcripts in Miller's
microarray data (13) on NF1-associated tissue samples, and
based on graphical analysis of that data, we found that there
was a positive association between Bmp2 expression and the
degree of malignancy in clinical samples of NF1-associated
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2).

We veriﬁed differential gene expression of Bmp2 by qPCR
under the experimental conditions analyzed for gene proﬁles
(Fig. 2A). Consistent with the microarray data, Bmp2
mRNA was overexpressed in ST88-14 compared with the
normal HSC and there was no signiﬁcant difference for
Bmp2 mRNA in ST88-14 cells treated with U0126 or
siNRas compared with their controls. We used 3 different
siNf1 oligos to verify the association between neuroﬁbromin
knockdown and Bmp2 expression in STS26T cells. All 3 of
the oligos signiﬁcantly inhibited the neuroﬁbromin and
increased the Bmp2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). We next
used an inducible oncogenic RAS expression system in the

Neurofibromin-associated

NRAS- and MEK1/2-independent genes

DS-10

STS26T cell line to mimic the loss function of GTPase-
activating domain of neuroﬁbromin (18), and thereby stud-
ied the RAS dependence of Bmp2 expression in MPNST
cells. Forty-eight hours after removal of doxycycline from the
cultural media, oncogenic RAS was induced as indicated by
increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig.
S3). However, Bmp2 expression was not signiﬁcantly altered
by increased RAS activity in this cell model (Fig. 2C),
indicating that Bmp2 mRNA changes were indeed depen-
dent on neuroﬁbromin but independent of the RAS-related
pathway activity.

BMP2 regulation of Smad1/5/8 activity is independent
of NRAS in MPNST cells

In the canonical signaling, BMP2 exerts its function by
binding to speciﬁc type I and II receptors to form a complex
with serine–threonine kinase activity, which subsequently
results in phosphorylatation of SMAD1/5/8. Phosphorylat-
ed SMAD1/5/8 proteins bind to SMAD4 and translocate to
the nucleus to regulate gene expression (33). However, the
roles of BMP2 in tumorigenesis are diverse including the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and angio-
genesis (32). We found that SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation
was increased in 3 independent NF1-deﬁcient MPNST cell
lines, ST88-14, T265, and sNF96.2, compared with normal
HSCs (Fig. 3A). The BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway activity
in ST88-14 was further evaluated by BMP2 stimulation after
serum starvation. Treating these cells with 100 ng/mL
BMP2 stimulated the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in
15 minutes after overnight serum starvation, with limited
additional phosphorylation after BMP2 treatment at 200
ng/mL (Fig. 3B). Because BMP2 was overexpressed in
MPNST cells, we suspected that the overexpressed BMP2
could promote SMAD1/5/8 activity. Further analysis of this
pathway in these cells revealed that siBmp2 treatment of
ST88-14 cells resulted in a approximately 60% reduction in
Bmp2 mRNA expression as determined by qPCR (Fig. 3C)
and inhibition of phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 (Fig.
3D).

We found negative regulation of SMAD1/5/8 signaling
due to NRAS suppression using siNRas knockdown in
ST88-14 cells resulting in approximately 40% reduction of
SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. However, when siBmp2 was
transfected into ST88-14 cells, the phosphorylation of
SMAD1/5/8 was inhibited by approximately 80%, substan-
tially greater than that from the NRas knockdown alone (Fig.
3D). A combination of siNRas and siBmp2 failed to inhibit
phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 beyond that of siBmp2
alone, indicating that the SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation was
mainly regulated by BMP2 signaling. A similar conclusion
was supported by results observed in NRas stable knock-
down cell line (ST88NRasKD) and nonsilencing control cell
line (ST88NonKD; Fig. 3E). As shown, the SMAD1/5/8
phosphorylation decreased in ST88NRasKD compared with
ST88NonKD, and the siBMP2 can further decrease the
SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in the ST88NRasKD cell line,
which showed the dominant role of BMP2 signaling to
control SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. Our data are consis-
tent with a recent report indicating that suppression of RAS
activity by salirasib, a S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid
(FTS), inhibited the expression of Bmp4, and thereafter
perturbed BMP4-related SMAD signaling in MPNST cell
lines (34). However, we did not ﬁnd decreased Bmp4
expression after inhibition of NRas by siRNA in our array
data. Together, these data indicated that although both

NRAS and BMP2 can control downstream SMADs, BMP2
exerted greater and independent inﬂuence on the phosphor-
ylation of SMAD1/5/8 compared with NRAS.

Blocking BMP2 signaling by LDN-193189 and shRNA
knockdown impairs the migration and invasion of
MPNSTs in vitro

Late-stage MPNST frequently metastasizes to the lungs,
lymph nodes, and liver, processes that require cellular
migration and invasion into tissues (35). Because BMP2
expression increases in the NF1-related malignant tumors
(ref. 13; see Supplementary Fig. S2), BMP2 may affect
malignancy via enhancement of cell migration and invasion
(22, 36). Therefore, we functionally assessed whether these
malignant properties were BMP2-regulated in MPNST cell
lines. We used LDN-193189, a potent inhibitor of BMP2
binding to its preferred type I receptors, ALK2, ALK3, and
ALK6 (37), and thereby BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signaling. We
evaluated the inhibition efﬁcacy of LDN-193189 at differ-
ent concentrations and the time dependency in MPNST
cells to optimize the drug application. We found that
to MPNST cells with 0.01 mmol/L LDN-
treatment
193189 for 1.5 hours can inhibit phosphorylation of
SMAD1/5/8 nearly completely (Supplementary Fig. S4)
and this concentration is lower than that reported to have
signiﬁcant side effects (37). Next, we tested the migration of

RAS–MEK Independent Malignancy in MPNST

Figure 3. Status of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 in MPNST cell lines. A, Western blot analyses indicate higher phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in the MPNST cell
lines compared with the normal HSC (HSC361). B, BMP2 stimulation of 15 minutes was applied to ST88-14 after overnight serum starvation (SS). Of note, 100
ng/mL BMP2 increased the phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 about 2-fold compared with PBS-treated control. Of note, 200 ng/mL had limited effects to
further increase the phosphorylation. C, siBmp2 signiﬁcantly decreased the Bmp2 mRNA expression in ST88-14 cells in qPCR. Data are presented as mean 
SD of 3 independent experiments, paired t test; n¼ 3; , P < 0.05. D, both siNRas and siBmp2 decreased the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, however, siBmp2
signiﬁcantly inhibited SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation than siNRas alone. E, NRas protein is hardly detectable in the stable NRas knockdown cell line,
ST88NRasKD, compared with the control cell line, ST88NonKD. Even the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in ST88NRasKD decreased compared with
ST88NonKD, 48 hours after siBmp2 treatment, the phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 decreased signiﬁcantly compared with the scrambled siRNA-treated
ST88NRasKD cells. The densitometry data of Western blot analyses is normalized to the intensity of total SMAD1/5/8 and tubulin, respectively. Data are
presented as mean  SD of 3 independent experiments, paired t test; n ¼ 3; , P < 0.05.

MPNSTs with various concentrations LDN-193189, and
quantiﬁed ability of cells to migrate into a scratched gap in
the cell monolayer. We quantiﬁed the cell migration images
of 2 MPNST cell lines, T265NonKD and ST88NonKD,
previously infected by lentivirus with nonsilencing shRNA
expressing a GFP. Using 0.1% and 5% FBS in
T265NonKD, we measured the area of the gap with different
LDN-193189 concentrations by determining the number of
pixels in the gap (Fig. 4A). There was signiﬁcant decrease in
the motility of cells into gap area using 0.01 mmol/L LDN-
193189 24 hours after the scratch. To be assured that the
growth rates were not inﬂuencing cell migration in the
scratch assay, we determined the growth rate of the cell line
T265NonKD with different concentrations of LDN-
193189 and FBS and found there was no signiﬁcant growth
retardation resulting from the LDN-193189 application at
this concentration (Supplementary Fig. S5). A similar inhib-
itory effect of LDN-193189 on cell migration was observed
in ST88NonKD cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). On the

contrary, we did not ﬁnd Bmp2 overexpression in STS26T,
a sporadic MPNST cell line with wild-type neuroﬁbromin,
and LDN-193189 treatment of GFP expressed STS26T
cells, STS26TNonKD, did not inhibit the migration of this
cell line (Fig. 4B).

To further conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of BMP2-related migra-
tion, we constructed the stable Bmp2 knockdown line,
ST88Bmp2KD, and compared its migration with the non-
silencing control, ST88NonKD (Fig. 4D). We used 1% FBS
because of the poor tolerance of ST88-14 cells to low FBS.
Bmp2 knockdown led to signiﬁcant decrease in migration of
these 2 cell lines at 1% or 5% FBS concentrations at 24 hour
after the scratch (Fig. 4C), with no signiﬁcant difference in
the growth rate (Supplementary Fig. S6), thus again exclud-
ing inﬂuences resulting from cell growth in scratch assay.
The effect of BMP2 on the invasive properties of MPNST
cells was measured by low growth factor Matrigel invasion
assays. Matrigel was placed on the bottom of the membrane
in the upper chamber, and the cells that digested the Matrigel

Inhibitory effects on migration of MPNST cells by blocking BMP2 signaling. A, scratch assay indicated that the LDN-193189 treatment inhibited
T265NonKD migration at 0.1% FBS and 5% FBS. Images were captured under the ﬂuorescent microscope at 24 hours after scratches representing 1 of 3
replicates. The number of pixels in the gap (the dark area) was quantiﬁed and data are presented in bar graph as mean  SD, paired t test; n ¼ 3; , P < 0.05;

culture medium. C, Bmp2 stable knockdown inhibited the migration of ST88-14 cell line signiﬁcantly. ST88Bmp2KD and ST88NonKD at 1% FBS and
5% FBS were applied to scratch assay. Images were captured under the ﬂuorescent microscope at 24 hours after scratches representing 1 of 3 replicates. The
pixels in the gap (the dark area) were quantiﬁed and presents as mean  SD in the bar graph, paired t test; n ¼ 3; , P < 0.05. D, qPCR indicated that the

and invaded through the 8-mm pores were counted on the
other side of the membrane. Medium with 5% FBS in the
well of each 24-well plate was used as the attractant, and
BMP2 and/or LDN-193189 were added into the serum-free
medium in the upper chamber with the cells. After 24 hours,
cells on the other side of membrane were stained by Quick-
Diff and counted using microscopy. We used 200 ng/mL
BMP2 and 0.1 mmol/L LDN-193189 to ensure the effective
concentration for 24 hours. The invasion of MPNST cells
was signiﬁcantly increased by 200 ng/mL BMP2 stimula-
tion, and the addition of LDN-193189 completely blocked
the effect induced by BMP2 in MPNST cell invasion (Fig.
5). Bmp2 stable knockdown cells, ST88Bmp2KD, and
T265Bmp2KD, also had reduced invasive properties com-
pared with ST88NonKD and T265NonKD, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, abrogation of BMP2
signaling in NF1-deﬁcient MPNST cells impaired the cel-
lular migration and invasive properties of these cells, which
suggests that BMP2 signaling could promote these malig-
nant properties of MPNSTs in vivo. Collectively, these data
indicate that the migration and invasiveness of MPNST, as
the malignancy-related properties, could be reduced by using
BMP2 as a molecular therapeutic target.

Discussion

The RAS-GAP domain of neuroﬁbromin is the most well-
studied functional domain in this large, 250 kD protein.

However, the malignant phenotypes of neuroﬁbromin-deﬁ-
cient MPNST cells cannot be totally rescued by the GAP
domain reconstitution alone (38, 39). Furthermore, RAS-
targeted therapeutic approaches, such as S-trans, trans-far-
nesylthiosalicylic acid, have provided limited efﬁcacy in
clinical studies of NF1 (8, 40). This implies that under-
standing the full complexity of neuroﬁbromin function in
MPNSTs requires insights into all Nf1-associated biologic
processes not only those dependent on RAS–MEK–ERK
signaling but also those independent of that pathway. In this
study, we conducted pathway-speciﬁc interventions to the
MPNST cell lines using genetic and chemical methods.
Comparative analysis of gene expression changes across these
treatments enabled us to classify those changes that were
speciﬁc to the NRAS and MEK1/2 pathways, and further to
discover novel neuroﬁbromin-related changes in MPNST
cell lines independent of those pathways. These genes have
potential as drug targets based on their speciﬁc mechanisms
of regulation.

This is the ﬁrst study that associates gene expression
changes to Ras/MEK1/2–independent pathways resulting
from NF1 deﬁciency in MPNST cell lines. The identiﬁca-
tion of novel neuroﬁbromin-related gene expression changes
that are independent of the NRAS and MEK1/2 pathways
was the major goal of this study. We summarized gene
changes independent of NRAS and MEK1/2 in ST88-14 as
DS-9, and DS-9 was further reﬁned with neuroﬁbromin

knockdown in STS26T cells to create DS-10 resulting in the
identiﬁcation of neuroﬁbromin-related but NRAS- and
MEK1/2-independent changes in multiple Nf1-deﬁcient
MPNST cell lines. From the DS-10, Bmp2 was chosen for
further study based on (i) the signiﬁcance in GSEA, and (ii)
the positive association between Bmp2 expression and
increasing malignancy of NF1-related tissues in the data of
Miller and colleagues (13). In addition, a case report sug-
gested a connection between acute deterioration of plexi-
form neuroﬁbroma to MPNST and BMP2 treatment
intended to facilitate bone fusion after surgery (41).

Bmp2 overexpression resulting from Nf1 deﬁciency but
independent of NRAS and MEK1/2 activities was veriﬁed in
MPNST cells by qPCR. Although a weak association of
NRAS and SMAD signaling was observed, the effect of
BMP2 on SMAD 1/5/8 signaling was far stronger than that
of NRAS, indicating that BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 may contrib-
ute independently to MPNST formation or malignant
phenotypes, via mechanisms to control cell migration,
invasiveness, and tumor growth, as it does in other tumor
types (32). Although BMP2 and BMP4 have certain path-
way and functional redundancy (42), these 2 factors had
different mechanisms of gene regulation in this study. We
did not ﬁnd decreased Bmp4 expression after inhibition of
NRas by siRNA in our dataset, but we did ﬁnd that the
expression of Gdf6, also known as Bmp13, signiﬁcantly
increased in ST88-14 cells (DS-4) but decreased in siN-
Ras-treated sample (DS-2). GDF6 is believed to bind the
same type I and II receptors as BMP2, which results in
phosphorylation/activation of SMAD1/5/8 (43). This
mechanism may explain the phosphorylation/activation of
SMAD1/5/8 that we observed in the regulation of SMAD1/
5/8 by the NRAS pathway. Inhibition of BMP2-SMAD1/5/
8 signaling by BMP2 shRNA interference or the BMP-

receptor kinase inhibitor, LDN-193189,

motility and invasiveness of MPNST cell lines in vitro.
Gordon and colleagues reported BMP2 could increase
MMP2 (type IV collagenase) expression in a pancreatic
cancer cell line through the SMAD1-dependent mechanism
(22). This mechanism seems to be active in the MPNST cells
that we tested, as Mmp2 expression in T265 cells was
downregulated by 0.1 mmol/L LDN-193189 after 48 hours
treatment in culture (Supplementary Fig. S9A). LDN-
193189 has been shown to suppress the activity of AKT
and inﬂuence the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells (44).
We also observed slightly decreased phosphorylation of AKT
resulting from the knockdown Bmp2 by siRNA in T265 and
ST88-14 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9B) and this signaling
axis has been reported to impair the malignant properties of
several different cancers (45, 46). These mechanisms could
also explain the impaired migration and invasiveness of
MPNST cells in this study.

Using comparative gene expression proﬁling, we identi-
ﬁed the relationship between the neuroﬁbromin deﬁciency
and BMP2 overexpression in MPNST cell
lines. It is
possible that BMP2 promotes cancer progression through
autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms as found in other
tumor types (20, 22, 23). This mechanism is consistent
with the important role of the tumor microenvironment in
MPNST tumorigenesis
Inhibition of BMP2
expression by RNA interference and the downstream path-
way by the speciﬁc inhibitor showed that BMP2-SMAD1/
5/8 signaling inﬂuenced the migration and invasion of
MPNSTs. Although direct inhibition of this pathway did
not signiﬁcantly decrease the cell proliferation, it provided
an additional option to control the malignant properties
(migration and invasion) of MPNST, and the possible
synergistic effects when it is applied with other treatments
could provide new approaches to improve the MPNST
therapy.

On the basis of the gene lists from various treatments in
this study, additional mechanisms supporting NF1-related
phenotypes can be proposed. Embryonic lethality due to
failure of heart development in the Nf1 knockout mouse
model (48) and likewise the increased risk for a variety of
cardiovascular disorders have to be identiﬁed in NF1
patients (49). Although the expression of neuroﬁbromin
GAP-related domain rescues the embryonic heart defects in
Nf1
mouse, its mechanism downstream RAS signaling is
still not clear. Adm gene, which was positively regulated by
increased NRAS activity (DS-5), encodes the protein adre-
nomedullin that functions as systemic vasodilator and natri-
uretic peptide. High Adm mRNA level has been associated
with hypertension (50) and myocyte hypertrophy (51, 52).
NF1 patients frequently experience hypertension (53, 54),
and in the Nf1 knockout mouse model, Xu and colleagues
reported that cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc knockdown of Nf1
contributed to the cardiac hypertrophy (55). In DS-5, Adm
mRNA increased in ST88-14 but was downregulated by
siNRas, and these alterations in gene expression could serve
as the mechanistic basis for an NF1-related cardiovascular
disease study. We observed Edn1 mRNA to be highly
expressed in ST88-14 (DS-6), and EDN1 has been reported
to play an important role in heart development (56) and has
been associated with cardiac hypertrophy in patient cohort
studies (57). These ﬁndings shed light on neuroﬁbromin–
NRAS–ADM and neuroﬁbromin–MEK1/2–EDN1 axes
identiﬁed in MPNST cells in this study, and could expand
our understanding of molecular mechanisms for cardiovas-
cular diseases in NF1 patients.

In summary, we investigated differential gene expression
in MPNST cell lines to identify novel functions of neuroﬁ-
bromin and potential drug targets for MPNST. In particular,
we found that BMP2 signaling is an NRAS- and MEK1/2-
independent effect of neuroﬁbromin deﬁciency in the
MPNSTs.
