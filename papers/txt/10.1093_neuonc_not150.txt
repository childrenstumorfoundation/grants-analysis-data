Background. Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is thought to be a key driver of tumor growth in
Merlin (NF2)-deﬁcient tumors. Everolimus is an oral inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) with antitumor activity in a variety of cancers.

Methods. We conducted a single-institution, prospective, 2-stage, open-label phase II study to estimate the response rate to everolimus
in neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients with progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS). Ten eligible patients were enrolled, including 2
pediatric patients. Everolimus was administered at a daily dose of 10 mg (adults) or 5 mg/m2/day (children ,18 y) orally in continuous
28-day courses, for up to 12 courses. Response was assessed every 3 months with MRI, using 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis,
and audiograms. Nine patients were evaluable for the primary response, deﬁned as ≥15% decrease in VS volume. Hearing response was
evaluable as a secondary endpoint in 8 patients.

Results. None of the 9 patients with evaluable disease experienced a clinical or MRI response. No objective imaging or hearing responses
were observed in stage 1 of the trial, and the study was closed according to predeﬁned stopping rules.

Conclusion. Everolimus is ineffective for the treatment of progressive VS in NF2 patients. We are currently conducting a pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic (“phase 0”) study of everolimus in presurgical VS patients to elucidate the biological basis for apparent treatment
resistance to mTORC1 inhibition in these tumors.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic
disordercaused by inactivation of the NF2 gene located on chromo-
some 22q and acts as a tumor suppressor.1 NF2 patients develop
multiple central and peripheral nervous system tumors, including
most commonly VS and other cranial nerve schwannomas, as
well as meningiomas and ependymomas.2 This progressive
tumor burden typically presents early in life and leads to substan-
tial morbidity, including progressive sensorineural hearing loss, as
well as other neurological impairments and signiﬁcantly reduced
life expectancy. As a consequence, NF2 patients suffer from com-
munication impairment and are at increased risk for negative
psychosocial repercussions, including depression.3,4

Traditional therapeutic options, consisting of surgery and/or ra-
diation therapy, are generally unsuccessful in reversing existing
neurological damage and frequently cause additional morbidity.
Conventional chemotherapies have not been used to treat NF2

patients due to concerns about unacceptable toxicities, such as
neuro- and/or ototoxicity, as well as their mutagenic properties,
which are of special concern in NF2 patients. During recent years,
our understanding of NF2 tumor biology has increased tremen-
dously, leading to intensiﬁed efforts to identify novel molecular
targets in preclinical studies, followed by validation in clinical trials.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway
has been identiﬁed as a major mediator of tumor suppressor activ-
ity of moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein (Merlin) and provides an
attractive therapeutic target in NF2.5 Recent studies have revealed
that loss of Merlin activates mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Mammalian target of rapamycin
regulates essential signal-transduction pathways, linking growth
stimuli to cell-cycle progression, and integrates signals involving
nutrient availability, energy status, and stress.6,7 Inhibition of
mTORC1 by rapamycin reduces the growth of Merlin-deﬁcient

arachnoidal, meningioma, and schwannoma cells.8,9 In addition,
targeting mTORC1 may inhibit production of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and therefore reduce tumor angiogenesis.10
This mechanism of action is relevant to vestibular schwannoma
(VS) because therapeutic inhibition of VEGF using bevacizumab is
a clinically validated treatment for VS that can lead to dramatic
responses.11 Everolimus (RAD001), a rapamycin analog,
is an
orally administered mTOR kinase inhibitor. Everolimus is approved
by the FDA for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (after
failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib) and advanced pan-
creatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as subependymal giant cell
tumors and angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis
complex.12 – 15 Similar to rapamycin, everolimus inhibits mTORC1
via binding to cyclophilin FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) but
has improved oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, as well as
reduced immunosuppressive activity.16 Everolimus reduces cell pro-
liferation, cell growth, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake, inhibits ex-
pression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and reduces VEGF expression
in animal models.17,18 Everolimus may also reduce the amount of
tumor vasculature and VEGF production without adversely affecting
vascular permeability.10

Everolimus is generally well tolerated, with the most frequently
reported adverse events including rash, mucositis, fatigue, and
headache. Noninfectious pneumonitis has been reported with
everolimus but is rarely severe and generally reversible. The
pharmacokinetics and safety of everolimus in children have been
previously reported in a pediatric phase I study.19

Based on this encouraging preclinical data and a favorable
safety proﬁle, we conducted a single-institution, prospective,
2-stage, open-label phase II study to estimate the response rate
to everolimus in NF2 patients with progressive VS and other
NF2-related tumors.

Methods
Patient Eligibility and Enrollment
Adult and pediatric patients of≥3 years of age and with a body surface area
(BSA) of ≥0.5 m2 were eligible. Inclusion criteria also mandated patients to
meet the revised National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF220
and to have at least one NF2-related VS with either volumetric progression
or signiﬁcant hearing decline over the preceding 12 months designated as
the primary target tumor. For eligibility, progressive tumor growth was
deﬁned as increase in tumor size of at least 2 mm in greatest diameter
on conventional MRI20 or a .10% volume increase by 3D volumetrics. Pro-
gressive hearing loss foreligibility was deﬁned as a drop in pure tone average
(PTA) of ≥10 dB at ≥2 nonconsecutive or consecutive frequencies or a drop
in word recognition score (WRS) below the 95% critical difference thresh-
old.21 Histological conﬁrmation was not required, as tumor biopsies are
rarely indicated in this disease. Additional keyeligibility criteria included Kar-
nofsky/Lansky performance status ≥50%; adequate bone marrow, renal,
and hepatic function; and stable neurological deﬁcits for≥1 week, if applic-
able. Key exclusion criteria included major surgery or signiﬁcant traumatic
injury within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug, prior treatment with an
mTOR inhibitor (eg, sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus), impairment of
gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may signiﬁcantly
alter the absorption of everolimus, active bleeding diathesis, and pregnancy
or breast-feeding in female patients.

A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed during screening.
Everolimus has been associated with disease reactivation in hepatitis B/C
carriers, and assessment of hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors
was therefore performed for all patients at screening. Hepatitis B/C

testing was performed in all at-risk patients, and if carrier status was con-
ﬁrmed, patients were started on appropriate antivirals beginning 1–2
weeks prior to the ﬁrst dose of everolimus, when applicable.

This study was conducted under a protocol approved by the institutional
review board of NYU Langone Medical Center and registered at Clinical-
Trials.gov (NCT01419639). Informed consent was obtained from the
patients and guardians in accordance with institutional policies. All con-
secutive patients who met study entry criteria and who consented to par-
ticipate were enrolled.

Study Design
This was a single-institution, prospective, 2-stage, phase II open label
study. The primary objective was to estimate the objective response rates
to everolimus in patients with NF2-related VS. Secondary objectives
included toxicity assessment of everolimus given daily in patients with
NF2 and estimation of the association of objective measures of response
on MRI (ie, volumetric tumor analysis) with clinical measures of response
(ie, audiogram) in patients with VS. A 2-stage Simon design22 was used to
test the null hypothesis of a response rate ≤5%, against the alternative hy-
pothesis of a response rate≥25%. Nine patients were to be enrolled in stage
1. If at least 1 patient of these 9 had a volumetric response in stage 1, at any
given evaluation point, an additional 8 patients were to be enrolled in stage
2. The overall alpha level for this design was 0.05 with a power of 80%. Ever-
olimus was to be considered effective and of interest for further study if,
after successful completion of both stages, the cumulative number of
responses was ≥3.

Treatment
Everolimus was provided by Novartis and administered in continuous
4-week courses. Pediatric patients ,18 years of age received 5 mg/m2/
day according to their BSA: 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg p.o. once daily for BSAs
of 0.50–0.99, 1.00–1.49, 1.5–1.99, and ≥2 m2, respectively. Adults ≥18
years of age received a standard recommended adult dose of 10 mg p.o.
once daily. For drug-induced stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due
to everolimus, local supportive care was recommended, modiﬁed accord-
ing to severity: for mild toxicity (grade 1), conservative measures such as
nonalcoholic mouthwash or salt-water (0.9%) mouthwash several times
a day until resolution; for more severe toxicity (grade ≥2), topical analgesic
mouth treatments (ie, local anesthetics such as benzocaine, butyl amino-
benzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without
topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1%.

Routine clinical evaluations, including a complete physical examination,
complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel,
uric acid, urinalysis, fasting serum lipid proﬁle (triglycerides, total choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein), and serum
pregnancy test (for females of child-bearing potential) were performed
at baseline, after day 1, at weeks 1, 2, and 4 of the ﬁrst course, and every
4 weeks thereafter. Patients were allowed to remain on study until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Adverse events
were graded using version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE). For patients who were unable to tolerate the
protocol-speciﬁed dosing schedule, drug dosing was interrupted or modi-
ﬁed according to protocol-prespeciﬁed rules, with a maximum of 2 dose
reductions allowed per patient. For dose delays of .21 days from the
intended day of the next scheduled dose, the patient was permanently dis-
continued from the study.

Response Evaluation
Brain and spine MRIs (in patients with spinal tumors) with dynamic
contrast-enhanced perfusion and 3D volumetrics and audiograms (in
patients with VS, although not required for patients with no measurable

hearing) were performed at baseline and after every third course, that is,
every 12 weeks. Three-dimensional tumor volumetrics were obtained on
postcontrast, T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with
gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences with a 1-mm slice thickness and no
gap, using semiautomated segmentation software (Vitrea platform).
Serial audiological evaluations were used to assess hearing response, in-
cluding determination of pure-tone thresholds and WRS. WRS was tested
using the 50-item recorded Central Institute for the Deaf CID-W22 mono-
syllable word list. WRS represents the most functionally relevant measure
of hearing in NF2 patients and is therefore recommended as a trial end-
point.21,23 PTA was calculated by the mean of the individual threshold fre-
quencies at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and was recorded for each
ear. An increase of ≥10 dB in the PTA between any follow-up assessment
and the baseline value was considered hearing deterioration, while a de-
crease by ≥10 dB indicated a clinically signiﬁcant improvement, as previ-
ously suggested.21

The primary efﬁcacy endpoint was best radiographic tumor response
(maximum tumor shrinkage) during the ﬁrst 12 courses of treatment; the
secondary efﬁcacy endpoint was hearing response. It has been previously
shown that 3D volumetrics for tracking VS are more sensitive than linear
measurements, with the latter tending to underestimate growth rates.24
Volumetrics have therefore become the modality of choice for deﬁning
and assessing radiographic response in NF2 clinical trials.21,23 For study pur-
poses, a ≥15% reduction in tumor volume in any of the target tumors con-
stituted a partial response. Complete disappearance of any of the target
tumors constituted a complete response. Stable disease was deﬁned as
,15% growth or shrinkage in tumor volume. Hearing response was
deﬁned as an improvement in the WRS above the 95% critical difference
threshold, compared with the baseline audiogram at the initiation of treat-
ment,21,25,26 and as recommended for the NF2 hearing endpoint.21 On the
contrary, volumetric growth of the primary target tumor by ≥15% deﬁned
volumetric progression and instigated discontinuation of therapy. Similarly,
in comparison with the baseline audiogram, a decrease in WRS below the
95% critical difference threshold constituted hearing progression. All
additional target tumors were monitored for growth or response, but any
progression in those tumors did not trigger treatment termination.

Statistical Analysis
Disease and patient characteristics at baseline were summarized using de-
scriptive statistics. Overall response rates were estimated with exact
Clopper–Pearson 95% conﬁdence limits.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from ﬁrst date of study
drug to date of volumetric or hearing progression, whicheverevent occurred
ﬁrst. PFS was summarized using the Kaplan–Meier methods for overall PFS.
Point estimate for PFS with 95% conﬁdence intervals was estimated.

Results
Patients
Ten eligible patients were enrolled between January and June
2012. There were 7 males (70.0%) and 3 females (30.0%), and
participants were a median age of 27 years at enrollment (range,
12–44), with 2 who were pediatric patients ,18 years of age. All
but 1 patient (patient 5; familial NF2) had sporadic NF2. All patients
or their legal representative provided written informed consent for
treatment. One patient decided to terminate study participation
after 3 weeks for personal reasons and was therefore not evaluable
for response, leaving 9 patients evaluable for the primary volumet-
ric response and 8 remaining hearing patients evaluable for
hearing response. Stage 2 of the study was never opened for
enrollment, as no objective response was observed in stage 1,

terminating accrual after a total of 9 evaluable patients was
reached. The majority (78%) of evaluable patients had received
prior treatment, most commonly lapatinib and/or bevacizumab,
for NF2-related tumors. Characteristics of all evaluable patients
are recorded in Supplementary Table S1.

Treatment
The median number of courses received by the 9 evaluable patients
was 6 four-week courses (range, 3–12). Three patients (patients 1,
2, and 3) came off trial due to tumor progression after 9, 3, and 5
courses, respectively. Three other patients (patients 7, 8, and 9) dis-
continued treatment after 6, 6, and 3 courses, respectively,
because of patient preference due to lack of volumetric and/or
hearing response. Two patients completed 12 courses, at which
time one (patient 4) met criteria for hearing progression and the
other (patient 6) had stable disease (both volumetrically and
hearing-wise). One patient came off study after 3 courses due to
toxicity, that is, pneumonia and decreased pulmonary function
(patient 5).

Toxicity
All 10 enrolled subjects were available for toxicity monitoring. Two
patients (20.0%) experienced grade 3 toxicities: transient azoo-
spermia (patient 1, resolved after drug discontinuation) and
fatigue (patient 7), at least possibly related to study drug. One
patient with prior history of aspiration pneumonias and preexisting
restrictive lung disease came off study after 3 courses due to tox-
icity: pneumonia and decreased pulmonary function. Observed
toxicity was otherwise minor (CTCAE 3.0 grades 1 and 2) and
most commonly included rash (80%) and mouth ulcers (100%),
and less commonly included fatigue (50%), headache (60%),
anemia (50%), and cholesterol elevation (70%). No grade 4 toxicity
was observed.

Volumetric and Hearing Responses
Baseline patient characteristics and responses to treatment are
summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively,
with additional details included in Tables S3 to S6. All 9 evaluable
patients had VS as the primary target tumor, with 2 patients
(patients 5 and 9) having bilateral VS as the target tumor, and
another patient (patient 1) with a right C1 nerve root tumor in add-
ition to his primary right VS, totaling 12 target tumors. Patient 1
experienced the best volumetric change, of 214.0% (shrinkage)
in his right C1 tumor, as well as the largest target tumor growth,
of +25.7% (progression) in his VS tumor compared with the base-
line measurement (see Fig. 1). Although 4 target tumors, including
3 primary target tumors, demonstrated some level of tumor reduc-
tion during therapy, they did not reach criteria for volumetric
response in any evaluable subjects: median of shrinkage was
211.9%, with a range from 23.6% to 214.0%. The 3 patients
(patients 1, 2, and 3) who discontinued study drug due to tumor
progression suffered from volumetric growths of +25.7%,
+17.1%, and +17.1%, respectively.

The distributions of the PTA and WRS for each ear at enrollment
are shown in Supplementary Table S4. None of the patients experi-
enced an improvement in their WRS sufﬁcient to meet the deﬁn-
ition of a clinical response, as established a priori. One patient

(patient 4) completed 12 courses, at which time he met criteria for
hearing progression. Two other patients (patients 2 and 4) sus-
tained deterioration in their mean PTA after 3 and 9 months, of
+12.5 and +18.8 dB, respectively. PTA did not meet improvement
criteria in any patient. The serial audiological measurements for

and S6.

Progression-free Survival and Median Time to Progression
Three patients experienced volumetric progression, and 1 patient
experienced hearing progression at a median time of 8 months
(95% conﬁdence interval: 3 mo, not yet reached; see Fig. 2).

Conclusion
None of our 9 NF2 patients with evaluable disease enrolled on
stage 1 of this prospective clinical trial experienced a volumetric
or hearing response, and we therefore concluded that everolimus
was ineffective for the treatment of progressive VS. We observed
the largest volumetric decrease, of 14%, in a cervical nerve root
tumor, raising the possibility that everolimus might be more effect-
ive in treating non-VS tumors in NF2 patients. Our series, however,
did not include other volumetrically measurable nerve root tumors
that would have allowed us to address this question.

Comparing our study results with the only other prospective
phase II clinical trial for NF2 patients with VS published to date,27
the antitumor activity of everolimus appears inferior to lapatinib.
Using the same response criteria, lapatinib performed superiorly,
with a 23.5% and a 30.8% volumetric and audiological response
rate, respectively.

Everolimus was generally well tolerated in this patient popula-
tion, with toxicities that were usually mild and manageable. Of
note, we did observe grade 3 pulmonary toxicity in 1 patient, neces-
sitating discontinuation of study drug. As many patients with NF2
exhibit lower cranial nerve dysfunction and associated dysphagia,
resulting in chronic aspiration and increased risk for aspiration
pneumonias, the added risk of everolimus for developing upper
and lower respiratory tract infections is of clinical concern in this
population.

There are several possible explanations for the lack of observed
activity of everolimus in our study. In vitro, inhibition of mTORC1 by
rapamycin exerted a selective cytostatic effect but did not induce

apoptosis in Merlin-deﬁcient arachnoidal, meningioma, and
schwannoma cells.8,9More recent preclinical data indicate that dif-
ferential regulation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 may be cell-type
dependent in NF2-deﬁcient tumors and correlate with response to
speciﬁc classes of mTOR inhibitors.28 Rapamycin and rapalogs,
such as everolimus, may release 2 major negative feedback
loops that operate to restrain mTORC1 signaling.7 One is mediated
by S6K, which phosphorylates and inactivates insulin receptor sub-
strate 1, limiting activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and
Akt.7 The other is mediated by Grb10, which upon phosphorylation
by mTORC1 becomes stabilized and binds to receptor tyrosine
kinases, opposing their ability to activate both Akt and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase.29,30 These feedback loops may be
operational in VS in vivo, limiting the efﬁcacy of everolimus. To
determine the clinically achievable intratumoral everolimus
concentrations in VS tissue and the effects on mTOR signaling,
effectors, and feedback inhibition, we are currently conducting
a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (“phase 0”) study of ever-
olimus in presurgical VS and meningioma patients (ClinicalTrials.
gov identiﬁer NCT01880749).

In summary, our study indicates that everolimus is generally
well tolerated in NF2 patients but does not possess clinically mean-
ingful antitumor activity, within the limitations of our study design.
The natural history of tumor growth in NF2 patients is vari-
able,20,31 – 33 and although it is possible that everolimus has a cyto-
static or growth-delaying effect on a subset of NF2-related tumors,
conclusive evidence of such an effect would require a much larger,
randomized phase II study, which is very difﬁcult to undertake in a
rare disease such as NF2. However, 2 other studies of everolimus for
NF2 patients with a very similar trial design are currently ongoing
(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁers NCT01345136 and NCT01490476)
and are expected to provide additional data on the safety, tolerabil-
ity, and efﬁcacy of everolimus in NF2 patients. Clearly, further
studies are needed to direct the future development of molecular
targeted therapies aimed at mTORC signaling networks in
NF2-associated tumors and improve the treatment of VS in NF2
patients.
