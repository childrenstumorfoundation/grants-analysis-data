Abstract
Aberrant ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling disrupts chondrocyte proliferation and growth plate size and
architecture, leading to various chondrodysplasias or bone overgrowth. These observations suggest that the duration, intensity
and cellular context of FGFR signaling during growth plate chondrocyte maturation require tight, regulated control for proper
bone elongation. However, the machinery ﬁne-tuning FGFR signaling in chondrocytes is incompletely deﬁned. We report here
that neuroﬁbromin, a Ras-GAP encoded by Nf1, has an overlapping expression pattern with FGFR1 and FGFR3 in prehypertrophic
chondrocytes, and with FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral ossiﬁcation. Based on previous evidence that
neuroﬁbromin inhibits Ras-ERK signaling in chondrocytes and phenotypic analogies between mice with constitutive FGFR1
activation and Nf1 deﬁciency in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes, we asked whether neuroﬁbromin is required to control FGFR1-
Ras-ERK signaling in maturing chondrocytes in vivo. Genetic Nf1 ablation in Fgfr1-deﬁcient chondrocytes reactivated Ras-ERK1/2
signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes and reversed the expansion of the hypertrophic zone observed in mice lacking Fgfr1 in
Col2a1-positive chondrocytes. Histomorphometric and gene expression analyses suggested that neuroﬁbromin, by inhibiting
Rankl expression, attenuates pro-osteoclastogenic FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes. We also provide evidence
suggesting that neuroﬁbromin in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, downstream of FGFRs and via an indirect mechanism, is
required for normal extension and organization of proliferative columns. Collectively, this study indicates that FGFR signaling
provides an important input into the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling axis in chondrocytes, and that this input is differentially
regulated during chondrocyte maturation by a complex intracellular machinery, of which neuroﬁbromin is a critical component.

Introduction
Endochondral bone formation is a complex, highly regulated and
orderly multi-step process by which long bones elongate during
development and heal following fracture. It relies on tight spatio-
temporal interactions and crosstalk between growth factors and
signaling from their receptors in target cells, including osteo-
chondroprogenitors, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Proper signaling within the growth plate between chondrocytes
and with neighboring cells is essential for the successful and

timely transition of resting chondrocytes to proliferating and
then hypertrophic chondrocytes (1,2). Failure or dysregulation
of any of these steps during development typically leads to shor-
tened stature or dwarﬁsm, structural bone abnormalities (3),
whereas failure during fracture healing in adults leads to fracture
non-union (pseudarthrosis) (4).

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling during endochondral
bone formation has been the subject of intense scientiﬁc inquiry.
In the growth plate, the receptors for FGFs (mainly FGFR3 and
FGFR1) were shown to be expressed in distinct zones: FGFR3 in

proliferating chondrocyte columns and FGFR1 in hypertrophic
chondrocytes (5–9). Constitutive FGFR3 activity in the growth
plate, caused by activating Fgfr3 mutations, inhibits chondro-
cyte proliferation, leading to growth arrest and inhibition of mat-
uration to hypertrophy (10–12). Molecularly, activating FGFR3
mutations cause overactive downstream ERK and STAT1 signal-
ing in the developing growth plate, leading to several forms of
dwarﬁsm which vary in severity depending on the degree of
FGFR3 constitutive activity and ERK activity (13–19). The function
of FGFR1 in endochondral bone growth, on the other hand, re-
mains unclear. Activating FGFR1 mutations have been associated
with craniosynostoses, caused by defects in intramembranous
ossiﬁcation (20–22). In the growth plate, the non-overlapping ex-
pression patterns of FGFR1-FGFR3 suggest that these receptors
have unique functions, mediated by differences in their ligand-
binding speciﬁcity and/or downstream signaling. In addition,
human cases indicate that FGFR1 signaling is crucially important
for endochondral ossiﬁcation. Activating mutations in FGFR1 in-
deed cause osteoglophonic dysplasia, a rare syndrome character-
ized by rhizomelic dwarﬁsm, craniosynostosis and non-ossifying
bone lesions, fracture healing deﬁcits, scoliosis, tibial bowing,
low bone mineral density, hypertelorism and pectus excavatum
(23–28).

Activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in response to FGF has been
observed in multiple cell types, whereas the activities of the
JNK kinases, the PI3K-AKT pathway and the PLCγ pathway vary
depending on cell type (29). FGF treatment of RCS chondrocytes
and PC12 adrenal cells, which leads to growth arrest, was
shown to be accompanied by strong and sustained ERK1/2 activa-
tion, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment, was not
(30,31). These results suggest the existence of cell-speciﬁc and
possibly differentiation stage-speciﬁc mechanisms to control
the intensity or duration of FGFR-Grb2-Sos-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
signaling.

One of the intracellular regulators of this pathway is neuroﬁ-
bromin, a Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP) that promotes
the conversion of active Ras bound to GTP to the inactive form of
Ras bound to GDP. Loss-of-function mutations in NF1, the gene
encoding neuroﬁbromin, causes chronic and unregulated
Ras and ERK1/2 activity, which is at the origin of the multiple con-
ditions associated with neuroﬁbromatosis type-1 (NF1). Approxi-
mately 40% of individuals with NF1 display skeletal pathologies,
including non-ossifying bone lesions, pseudarthrosis, shortened
stature, idiopathic or dystrophic scoliosis, asymmetry of facial
bones, osteosclerosis, tibial bowing, hypertelorism, pectus exca-
vatum and low bone mineral density (32–36), which are reminis-
cent of the bone manifestations observed in individuals with
osteoglophonic dysplasia, although more focal and heteroge-
neous than the latter. Our previous studies have shown that
Nf1 deletion in Col2a1-positive murine chondrocytes leads to
Ras-ERK1/2 chronic activation, to a reduction in the proliferation
and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate and to dwarﬁsm
compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (37,38). In addition,
these mice display increased number of osteoclasts at the osteo-
chondral border, and Nf1-deﬁcient chondrocytes favored osteoclas-
togenesis ex vivo, suggesting that in chondrocytes, neuroﬁbromin
serves to limit osteoclastogenesis and growth plate catabolism dur-
ing development.

Genetic mouse models with Nf1 deﬁciency or Fgfr1 gain- or
loss-of-function mutations support a negative association be-
tween FGFR1 signaling and neuroﬁbromin activity. First, we
found that the activation of ERK1/2 by FGF2 treatment is dam-
pened to baseline activity within 30 min in WT chondrocytes,
whereas it lasts more than 1 h in Nf1-deﬁcient chondrocytes.

These ﬁndings suggested that neuroﬁbromin acts as a brake on
FGFR signaling in chondrocytes (38). Second, the hypertrophic
zone of Fgfr1Col2cKO mice, in which Fgfr1 is ablated in Col2a1-posi-
tive chondrocytes, is longer than in WT littermates, in contrast to
the shortened hypertrophic zones of the Nf1Col2cKO mice, which
lack Nf1 in the same Col2a1-positive cells (7,38). Third,
Fgfr1Pro250Arg mice, harboring a constitutively active Fgfr1Pro250Arg
allele at the endogenous Fgfr1 locus (39), are dwarfed as are
Nf1Col2cKO mice (37–39). Lastly, at the molecular level, the growth
plate expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) and osteo-
pontin (Opn), two proteins contributing to growth plate catabol-
ism and osteoclastogenesis at the osteochondral front, are
downregulated in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice while they are upregulated in
Nf1Col2cKO mice (7,38). Therefore, constitutive activation of FGFR1
in Fgfr1Pro250Arg mice leads to similar phenotypes to the ones ob-
served in Nf1Col2cKO mice lacking Nf1 in chondrocytes, whereas
loss of FGFR1 in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice triggers phenotypes that are
mostly opposite to the ones observed in Nf1Col2cKO mice. Collect-
ively, these observations led us to hypothesize that neuroﬁbro-
min acts as a brake on FGFR1 signaling in the developing
growth plate. In this study, we generated double mutant mice
lacking both Nf1 and Fgfr1 in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes to
ask whether loss of activity of neuroﬁbromin and thus activation
of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling reverses the aberrant hypertrophic zone
length and decreased osteoclastogenesis caused by lack of FGFR1
signaling in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice (Fig. 1B). Our results support a model
whereby neuroﬁbromin controls: (i) the cartilage catabolism-
promoting function of FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic chondro-
cytes and (ii) the organization and extension of proliferative
chondrocyte columns, via regulation of FGFR3 (and possibly
FGFR1) signaling in prehypertrophic chondrocytes.

Results
Fgfr1, Fgfr3 and Nf1 expression is localized to distinct
zones in the growth plate

A ﬁrst requirement for neuroﬁbromin to control FGFR1 signaling
is for the two proteins to be expressed in the same chondrocyte
population. To address this question, we performed in situ
hybridization (ISH) on serial parafﬁn sections on postnatal (P)
WT long bone growth plates, using Indian hedgehog (Ihh) as a
marker of the prehypertrophic zone. At both P0 and P7, Fgfr1 and
Nf1 transcripts were both detected in the hypertrophic zone, with
minimal detectable expression in the proliferation zone, where
Fgfr3 was localized primarily. Both Fgfr1 and Nf1 transcripts had
weaker expression detectable in the prehypertrophic zone
(Fig. 1A). Thus Fgfr1 expression overlapped with Nf1 expression
in the prehypertrophic, hypertrophic and perichondrium areas,
while Fgfr3 expression only overlapped with Nf1 expression in
prehypertrophic chondrocytes at both P0 and P7. Although co-
expression does not prove functional interaction, these results
suggest that neuroﬁbromin may regulate FGFR1 signaling rather
than FGFR3 signaling in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes.

and Nf1Col2cKO mice (7,37,38) and the fact that FGFR activation and

postnatal development. In situ hybridization (red signal) on serial distal femur sections shows that Fgfr1 localizes to prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes at P0

in chondrocytes (38), led us to the hypothesis that neuroﬁbromin
inhibits, among the many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) ex-
pressed in the growth plate, the signaling of FGFR1 in mature
chondrocytes (Fig. 1B). This hypothesis is not functionally test-
able in vitro due to the dynamic nature of growth plate develop-
ment and challenges in generating maturing chondrocytes in
vitro, and can be best addressed genetically and in vivo, by either
overexpressing neuroﬁbromin in chondrocytes to rescue the phe-
notypes of cells with activation of FGFR1, or by reducing neuroﬁ-
bromin activity in cells lacking FGFR1 to artiﬁcially reactivate
Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in these cells. In the latter option, we rea-
soned that lack of neuroﬁbromin, leading to Ras-ERK1/2 pathway
activation (38) (Fig. 1C, bottom left and right), in Fgfr1-deﬁcient
chondrocytes (in which Ras-ERK1/2 signaling is reduced,
Fig. 1C, top right), should reverse the growth plate phenotypes
of Fgfr1Col2cKO mice. We thus generated double mutant mice lack-
ing both Nf1 and Fgfr1 in Col2a1-expressing chondrocytes
(DblCol2cKO mice) and compared their skeletal phenotypes to sin-
gle knockout, Fgfr1Col2cKO and Nf1Col2cKO littermates.

Gross examination over the period of rapid growth before
weaning indicated that both body length (Fig. 2A) and body
weight (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1) were reduced in both
Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO mice compared with WT littermates
and Fgfr1Col2cKO mice. Similarly, both genotypes had signiﬁcantly
shorter bones than WT and Fgfr1Col2cKO mice at P18 (Fig. 2B).
Fgfr1Col2cKO mice also had reduced stature (by P4), body weight
(by P9) and tibial length (P18) compared with WT littermates,

despite the increased size of their hypertrophic zone (Fig. 2D)
(7). Body length, body weight and tibia length were not signiﬁ-
cantly different between Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO mice (Fig. 2A
and B).

To assess changes in growth plate structure between WT, sin-
gle mutant Fgfr1Col2cKO and Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO mice, growth
plate histomorphometry was performed, analyzing the FGFR3-
rich proliferation and FGFR1-rich hypertrophic zones longitudin-
ally at P0, 7 and 14 days of age. The proliferation zones of all four
groups of mice were not signiﬁcantly different until P14, at which
time the proliferation zones of Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO were sig-
niﬁcantly shorter than that of WT and Fgfr1Col2cKO mice, although
they were not statistically different from each other (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, the hypertrophic zone across all three postnatal time
points was elongated by inactivation of Fgfr1 in Col2a1-expressing
chondrocytes (Fig. 2D and E), in agreement with previous studies
(7). Ablation of Nf1 in double mutant DblCol2cKO mice reduced the
size of this zone compared with WT and Fgfr1Col2cKO littermate
mice at P0, 7 and 14, to values similar to the ones observed in
Nf1Col2cKO mice (the hypertrophic zones of Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO
mice were not statistically different from each other). In addi-
tion, lack of Nf1 in Fgfr1-deﬁcient hypertrophic chondrocytes
led to disturbances in the orderly stacking of the proliferative
chondrocyte columns observed in WT and Fgfr1Col2cKOmice
(Fig. 2E). Increased phospho-ERK1/2 immunostaining in the
growth plate prehypertrophic and hypertrophic regions in
DblCol2cKO mice compared with Fgfr1Col2cKO mice (Fig. 1C, bottom

right) conﬁrmed reactivation of the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway upon
Nf1 ablation in these mice. In addition, in situ hybridization and
quantitative RT–PCR (qPCR) veriﬁed efﬁcient Fgfr1 deletion in
the growth plate of Fgfr1Col2cKO mice and that Fgfr1 expression
was not affected with regard to level of expression or growth
plate localization upon Nf1 ablation (see Fig. 5A and C). Thus,
Nf1 ablation in Fgfr1-deﬁcient chondrocytes reverses the increase
in growth plate hypertrophic zone observed in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice,
and has a deleterious effect on the stacking of the proliferative
chondrocyte columns, which was not affected in mice lacking
Fgfr1 only.

Lack of Nf1 in Fgfr1-deﬁcient chondrocytes reverses the
reduction in osteochondral osteoclast number observed
in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice

Osteoclast number at the chondro-osseous junction (the bone
marrow zone immediately adjacent to the growth plate) was
shown to be reduced in Fgfr1Col2cKOmice, and Mmp9 and Opn ex-
pression were lower in Fgfr1 null chondrocytes compared with
WT chondrocytes (7). In contrast, Nf1Col2cKO mice display an in-
crease in osteoclast number at the osteochondral border

(37,38,41), and Nf1 null chondrocytes have elevated expression
of Rankl, Opn, Mmp9 and Mmp13, all of which are important for
extracellular bone matrix catabolism (38). These observations
suggested that FGFR1 and neuroﬁbromin were both involved, in
an antagonistic fashion, in the mechanism by which mature
chondrocytes stimulate growth plate catabolism. To determine
whether the reduced osteoclast density at the osteochondral bor-
der in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice could be rescued by concurrent deletion of
Nf1 in growth plate chondrocytes, we quantiﬁed osteoclast num-
ber in TRAP-stained thin bone sections from WT, Nf1Col2cKO,
Fgfr1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO mice. When Fgfr1 was deleted in
Col2a1-expressing chondrocytes of newborn and P14 mice, osteo-
clast number at the chondro-osseous junction was reduced
(Fig. 3A–C), in line with previous studies in Fgfr1Col2cKO embryos
(7). Upon Nf1 deletion, a clear increase in the number of TRAP-
positive multinucleated osteoclasts was observed in DblCol2cKO
growth plates versus WT mice. Osteoclast number was not sig-
niﬁcantly different between DblCol2cKO and Nf1Col2cKO growth
plates at P0 and P14 (Fig. 3A–C). Consistently, we found that
Rankl expression was elevated in Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO growth
plates, yet decreased in Fgfr1Col2cKO growth plates taken from
5-day-old pups, compared with WT animals (Fig. 3D). Opg

Figure 3. Nf1 ablation in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice reverses their decrease in osteoclastogenesis at the osteochondral junction. TRAP staining in distal femurs from P0 pups (A) and
quantiﬁcation of the number of TRAP-positive (red) osteoclasts per osteochondral border surface (BS) in P0 (B) and P14 (C) distal femur sections showed that the number of
osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous junction in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice is reduced compared with WT littermates, and that Nf1 deletion in DblCol2cKO mice leads to higher number
of osteoclasts compared with Fgfr1Col2cKO mice. Osteoclast number in Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO was not signiﬁcantly different from each other. The osteochondral border
surface is indicated by a dotted line (*P < 0.05 versus WT unless indicated, n = 4 per group, one-way ANOVA, scale bar: 100 μm). (D) Rankl expression is increased in P5 long
bone growth plate cartilage from Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO mice and decreased in Fgfr1Col2cKO P5 growth plate cartilage when compared with WT (*P < 0.05 versus WT unless
indicated, n = 4 per group, one-way ANOVA, qPCR).

expression was unchanged in all four genotypes (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S2). These ﬁndings suggest that neuroﬁbromin at-
tenuates FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic growth plate chondro-
cytes to limit their osteoclastogenic-promoting function.

Nf1 ablation in Col10a1-positive hypertrophic
chondrocytes reduces hypertrophic zone width but does
not impair bone elongation

The results above suggest a predominant role of neuroﬁbromin,
downstream of FGFR1, in hypertrophic chondrocytes, however,
neuroﬁbromin is also expressed in prehypertrophic chondro-
cytes (Fig. 1) and osteoblasts (37,38,40). In an effort to determine
the function of neuroﬁbromin more speciﬁcally in hypertrophic
growth plate chondrocytes, we generated Nf1Col10cKO mice lacking
Nf1 in Col10a1-positive cells, using the Col10-Cre driver transgenic
mice (42). We ﬁrst used these mice bred with Rosa26:LacZ reporter
mice (43) to examine the activity of the Col10-Cre transgene spe-
ciﬁcally during the active phase of postnatal bone elongation at
P0, P7 and P14, since prior studies only reported activity embryo-
nically and shortly after birth (P1, P3) or 5 weeks after birth
(42,44,45). We found, at all ages analyzed, that the Col10-Cre trans-
gene is active in hypertrophic chondrocytes, as demonstrated by
positive β-galactosidase staining in this area of the growth plate,
but not in proliferative columns. β-galactosidase activity was
also observed in osteoblast-like cells in the primary spongiosa
and embedded osteocyte-like cells (Fig. 4A, data not shown).
Nf1 ﬂox/ﬂox mice were then bred to Col10-Cre mice to generate,
through two rounds of breeding, Nf1Col10cKO mice and WT litter-
mates. Unexpectedly, Nf1Col10cKO mice had a normal stature and
physical appearance at all time points analyzed (from P0 to
P18) compared with WT littermates (Fig. 4B). Histologically, the
proliferation zone length of Nf1Col10cKO growth plates was not sig-
niﬁcantly shorter than WT at P0 or P18 (Fig. 4C). The hypertrophic
zone of Nf1Col10cKO growth plates was, however, signiﬁcantly
shorter than WT at P0 and P18 (Fig. 4D). We also found that the
number of osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous border was signiﬁ-
cantly higher in Nf1Col10cKO compared with WT mice (Fig. 4E and
F). The growth plates of Nf1Col10cKO mice appeared normal with or-
derly proliferative chondrocyte columns as opposed to the disor-
ganized columns seen in Nf1Col2cKO growth plates, in which Nf1 is
ablated in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells (Fig. 4G). Col-
lectively, these results suggests that Nf1 loss-of-function in pre-
hypertrophic chondrocytes, where Nf1 expression overlaps with
both Fgfr3 and Fgfr1, is responsible for the size and growth plate
columnar defects observed in Nf1Col2cKO mice, whereas Nf1 in
hypertrophic chondrocytes primarily regulates osteoclastogen-
esis in the primary spongiosa.

Fgfr3 expression is not altered upon Fgfr1 ablation in
Col2a1-positive chondrocytes

Our analyses suggest that lack of Nf1 in prehypertrophic chondro-
cytes causes alterations in the size and organization of Nf1 and
Fgfr1-negative, but Fgfr3-positive, proliferative chondrocyte col-
umns. Ectopic Fgfr3 upregulation was previously observed in
Fgfr1-deﬁcient osteoblasts (7), and it has been shown that chon-
drocytic FGFR and ERK1/2 signaling in general are inhibitory to
chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation (although these effects
were not attributed to an individual or speciﬁc FGF receptor)
(11,46). These observations prompted us to question whether
Nf1 or Fgfr1 deﬁciency altered growth plate Fgfr3 expression
level or tissue localization, thus potentially causing some of the
observed changes in proliferation and hypertrophic zones.

Human Molecular Genetics, 2015, Vol. 24, No. 9 | 2557

Hence, we assessed Fgfr3 expression by in situ hybridization
and qPCR analyses in the growth plates of Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO
mice. We found that Fgfr3 expression was not mislocalized when
Nf1 was deleted alone or in combination with Fgfr1, and re-
mained primarily in the proliferation zone of the growth plate
with some expression in the prehypertrophic zone at P0
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, quantitative assessment by qPCR showed
no signiﬁcant differences in Fgfr3 expression in Fgfr1Col2cKO,
Nf1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO growth plates versus WT growth plates
5 days after birth (Fig. 5B and C).

We also sought to conﬁrm whether expression levels and lo-
calization of Fgfr1 were altered by Nf1 deletion in Nf1Col2cKO growth
plates, and the efﬁciency of Fgfr1 deletion with the Col2-Cre dri-
ver. We found that Fgfr1 was normally localized in Nf1Col2cKO
growth plates and that Fgfr1 expression was, as expected, re-
duced in DblCol2cKO growth plates (Fig. 5A, left column). Quantita-
tively, Fgfr1 expression was efﬁciently lowered using the Col2-Cre
driver as assessed by qPCR on P5 growth plates and was not re-
duced in Nf1Col2cKO growth plates (Fig. 5C). Together, these results
conﬁrm efﬁcient Fgfr1 recombination in Fgfr1Col2cKO and DblCol2cKO
mutant mice, and indicate that Fgfr3 expression is not upregu-
lated in response to Fgfr1 ablation in these two models.

Pan-FGFR inhibition with BGJ-398 enhances bone growth
in Nf1Col2cKO mice
The difference in bone size between Nf1Col2cKO and Nf1Col10cKO
mice and the overlap of expression between Nf1, Fgfr1 and Fgfr3
in the prehypertrophic zone suggested that neuroﬁbromin in pre-
hypertrophic chondrocytes may control either FGFR3 or FGFR1
signaling and the mechanism by which these cells inhibit chon-
drocyte proliferation and column stacking. To address this
question and because of the difﬁculties in generating triple con-
ditional knockout mice lacking Fgfr1, Fgfr3 and Nf1 with proper
littermate controls, we chose to administer the pan-FGFR inhibi-
tor BGJ-398 (47) or vehicle subcutaneously and daily to WT and
Nf1Col2cKO newborns. We assessed body weight, body length, tibial
length and growth plate parameters at the termination of the
experiment 18 days later. Pan-FGFR inhibition by this dose of
BGJ-398 reduced ERK1/2 activation in both prehypertrophic
and hypertrophic chondrocytes in Nf1Col2cKO mice when com-
pared with vehicle-treated animals (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S3A), conﬁrming that the drug was active and acting, at
least in part, directly on growth plate chondrocytes. BGJ-398 sig-
niﬁcantly improved tibial length and the lengths of the prolifer-
ation and hypertrophic zones in the growth plates of Nf1Col2cKO
mice (Fig. 6A–C), whereas it did not impact bone growth in
WT mice. Body length and weight in Nf1Col2cKO mice treated by
BGJ-398 were improved compared with vehicle control, but the
differences did not reach statistical signiﬁcance for these two
parameters (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Material, Fig. S3B). Notice-
ably, BGJ-398 treatment improved the columnar organization of
the proliferation zone (Fig. 6E). Since the proliferation zone in
Fgfr1Col2cKO mice is normal in terms of width and organization,
and since Nf1 is not detectable in this zone, this effect of pan-
FGFR inhibition on the width and organization of the proliferation
zone in Nf1Col2cKO mice suggests that neuroﬁbromin in prehyper-
trophic chondrocytes, and downstream of FGFR3 mainly, is re-
quired for normal chondrocyte proliferation and column stacking.

particular the potential contribution of Ras-GAP proteins to these
activities remain incompletely characterized, in part because of
the dynamic and complex nature of the process of endochondral
bone formation and the overlap in expression and signaling path-
ways downstream of FGFRs. This study provides the ﬁrst compre-
hensive experimental and genetic evidence indicating that
the Ras-GAP activity of neuroﬁbromin is required in prehyper-
trophic chondrocytes for normal growth plate elongation and

proliferative column organization, and is required in hypertrophic
chondrocytes, downstream of FGFR1, to attenuate the osteoclasto-
genic properties of these cells in contact with the bone marrow en-
vironment, and thus the coupling between chondrogenesis and
bone modeling during development.

A number of signaling proteins are phosphorylated in re-
sponse to chondrocyte FGF stimulation, including Shc, PLCγ,
STAT1, Gab1 and FRS2α (48–50). These signaling events lead to

expression (left column) remains localized to hypertrophic chondrocytes in Nf1 null chondrocytes and has a less intense signal in DblCol2cKO growth plates (bottom

the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that control cell
shape, proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. In
particular, the docking proteins FRS2α and FRS2β are major med-
iators of the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways that
ﬁne-tune the signal initiated by FGFR stimulation by negative
feedback mechanisms. This study identiﬁes the Ras-GAP neuro-
ﬁbromin as one critical intracellular components controlling
FGFR signaling, speciﬁcally in postmitotic growth plate chondro-
cytes, and further supports the notion that the intensity or dur-
ation of FGFR signals during endochondral bone formation
must be tightly controlled for harmonious development of the
growth plate.

Dwarﬁsm in humans is primarily attributed to FGFR3-activat-
ing mutations and the resulting lack of extension of the growth
plate proliferating zone (13–16), where FGFR3 is highly expressed.
FGFR3 activation affects chondrocyte proliferation in a cell-
autonomous fashion but also indirectly via repression of IHH
signaling (51). Global knockout of Fgfr3 on the other hand pro-
duces mice with a bone overgrowth phenotype including

expanded proliferation and hypertrophic zones, enhanced osteo-
blast differentiation and enhanced osteoclastogenesis (9,52). In
contrast to Fgfr3−/− mice, chondrocyte proliferation is reduced
in Nf1Col2cKO mice (38), but the width of the proliferation zone is
not affected in Nf1Col10cKO mice. Because Nf1 is expressed in pre-
hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, but not detectable
in proliferating chondrocytes, these results suggest that neuroﬁ-
bromin is required in prehypertrophic chondrocytes to indirectly
control the extension and organization of proliferative chondro-
cyte columns. This conclusion is further supported by the bene-
ﬁcial effect of pan-FGFR inhibition on bone size, proliferation
zone width and columnar organization in growing Nf1Col2cKO
mice (although other systemic or indirect effects of the drug can-
not be excluded). These results, along with the fact that
Fgfr1Col2cKO mice have no proliferation zone size phenotype and
that Fgfr1-null prehypertrophic chondrocytes still are positive
for phospho-ERK (Fig. 1C), suggest that in prehypertrophic chon-
drocytes, neuroﬁbromin controls FGFR3 signaling to regulate, in
an indirect, paracrine fashion, chondrocyte proliferation zone

length and their typical columnar organization. This does not
rule out a role of FGFR1 signaling in prehypertrophic chondro-
cytes, based on the severe dwarﬁsm of individuals with osteoglo-
phonic dysplasia and mice with FGFR1-activating mutations.

Concurrent ablation of Nf1 and Fgfr1 in the same Col2a1-
expressing cell population and at the same time during devel-
opment reversed the increase in hypertrophic zone width
observed in Fgfr1Col2cKOmice. These ﬁndings suggest that reactiva-
tion of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by Nf1 deletion in Fgfr1-
deﬁcient hypertrophic chondrocytes functionally compensated
for the reduced FGFR1 signaling in these cells in vivo. We have
shown in a previous study that neuroﬁbromin controls Rankl ex-
pression and osteoclastogenesis in mature chondrocytes, and
thus that increased growth plate catabolism likely contributes

to the reduction in hypertrophic width observed in Nf1Col2cKO
mice (38). The observation that chondrocytic ablation of Nf1 re-
verses the reduction in osteoclast number observed in Fgfr1Col2cKO
mice, and the fact that the hypertrophic zone width in Nf1Col10cKO
mice is shorter (while being longer in Fgfr1Col2cKO mice) compared
with WT mice, suggests that neuroﬁbromin, in hypertrophic
chondrocytes, inhibits the pro-osteoclastogenic signals from
FGFR1 in the chondrocytic lineage. It remains to be determined
if activation of the transcription factor ATF4, resulting from the
lack of Nf1, contributes to the observed increase in Rankl expres-
sion, as was previously shown in mature osteoblasts (53). Though
RANKL and OPG are obvious candidates to mediate changes in
osteoclastogenesis at the osteochondral border, and though we
indeed observed signiﬁcant changes in Rankl expression in vivo,

we cannot rule out the possibility that other pro- or anti-osteo-
clastogenic molecules are differentially regulated in the pres-
ence/absence of neuroﬁbromin or FGFR1.
It must also be
emphasized that the relatively modest increase in Rankl expres-
sion in the growth plates of Nf1Col2cKO mice is to be expected
based on the nature of the cells expressing this cytokine in the
growth plate, i.e. hypertrophic chondrocytes. This area of the
growth plate indeed represents a small volume of the growth
plate, is under constant catabolism, and contains cells that are
hypertrophic (hence less cell number per volume) and rapidly
eliminated. These characteristics are even more pronounced in
the shortened growth plates of Nf1Col2cKO mice, hence the increase
in Rankl expression in this transient area cannot be of high
amplitude.

The width of the hypertrophic zone depends on multiple fac-
tors, including growth plate maturation, catabolism but also
chondrocyte apoptosis. However, no difference in chondrocyte
apoptosis has been detected between WT mice and mice lacking
FGFR1 (Fgfr1Col2cKO) (7) or B-Raf (54) or ERK1/2 (55) in Col2a1-
expressing chondrocytes. On the other hand, we have shown in
previous studies that Nf1-null chondrocytes have enhanced sen-
sitivity to phosphate-mediated apoptosis in vitro, although we
failed to detect increased in vivo apoptosis in the growth plate
of Nf1Col2cKO mice (38). Chondrocyte forced expression of Spry1,
which leads to ERK activation, as well as an FGFR3-activating mu-
tation, did result in premature chondrocyte apoptosis in vivo
(56,57), although constitutive activation of MEK1 in these cells
did not affect apoptosis (11). Therefore, Fgfr1 loss-of-function
does not alter the rate of chondrocyte apoptosis, but ERK consti-
tutive activation promotes it, via mechanism(s) that remains to
be characterized.

Recalcitrant bone healing (pseudarthrosis) affects about 5% of
children with NF1. In this condition, tibial bowing is followed by
fracture and absence of repair, accumulation of myoﬁbroblasts,
non-mineralized matrix and hyaline cartilage, suggesting that
the early stages of endochondral bone repair are blocked (58).
The developmental phenotypes observed in this study suggest
that pan-FGFR inhibition might have a beneﬁcial effect in the set-
ting of NF1 pseudarthrosis on the formation of the cartilaginous
callus and its transition to a calciﬁed callus required for bone
union following fracture, as bone development recapitulates
the main stages of adult bone repair. Although very speculative,
this hypothesis can be addressed in preclinical models of NF1
pseudarthrosis, particularly if treatment can be applied locally
to avoid undesirable effects on other tissues.

Collectively, our ﬁndings thus indicate that neuroﬁbromin in
postmitotic growth plate chondrocytes plays an integral part in
the Ras-ERK-dependent regulatory mechanisms that allow
these cells to integrate and balance signaling from various
growth factors via RTKs like FGFRs. These ﬁndings are relevant
to genetic diseases affecting embryonic development of the skel-
eton like chondrodysplasias, but also to genetic conditions im-
pacting bone healing in adults, like neuroﬁbromatosis type 1
and RASopathies in general.

generate WT (cre-negative), Fgfr1Col2cKO (Col2a1-Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Nf1+/+;) and DblCol2cKO(Col2a1-Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox) mice (59–
61). In arm two, we bred Col2a1-Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/+;Nf1ﬂox/+ males with
Fgfr1ﬂox/+;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox females to generate WT (cre-negative),
Nf1Col2cKO (Col2a1-Cre;Fgfr1+/+;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;) and DblCol2cKO (Col2a1-
Fgfr1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox) mice. Arm two used Col2a1-
Cre;
Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/+;Nf1ﬂox/+ males rather than Col2a1-Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/+;
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox males because Col2a1-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice are infertile.
Progenies were obtained at a Mendelian ratio (∼12.5% Fgfr1Col2cKO,
∼6.25% Nf1Col2cKO and ∼12.5% or ∼6.25% DblCol2cKO, depending on
breeding arm), indicating the absence of embryonic lethality.

Nf1Col10cKO and WT littermate mice were obtained by breeding
Col10-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox males with Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox females (42,60). Col10-Cre;
Rosa26:lacZ mice were obtained by breeding homozygous Col10-
Cre mice with homozygous ROSA26 reporter mice (43). WT and
Nf1Col2cKO littermate mice for drug studies were obtained by breed-
ing Col2-Cre;Nf1ﬂox/+ males with Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox females (59,60). Fgfr1
(B6.129S4-Fgfr1tm5.1Sor/J) and Nf1 (STOCK Nf1tm1Par/J) ﬂoxed
mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME, USA). Col2-Cre mice were originally obtained from Dr Gerard
Karsenty (Columbia University). Col10-Cre;Rosa26:LacZ mice were
a gracious gift from Dr Douglas Mortlock (Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN, USA). Col10-Cre mice were originally generated by
Dr K. von der Mark (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany).
Tissues were harvested at the indicated times and ﬁxed at 4°C
for 24 h in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA). Body and tibia lengths were assessed by caliper
and postmortem Faxitron X-Ray (Tucson, AZ, USA), respectively.
Body length was measured while animals were in the prone pos-
ition and taken from the tip of the nose to the anus with a digital
caliper. BGJ-398 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) or vehicle
(PEG300/D5W, 2:1, v/v) was injected subcutaneously daily from
birth and for 18 days. BGJ-398 is most potent at FGFRs 1–3 with
in vitro IC50s of 0.9–1.4 nM but has off target, sub-optimal activity
at other non-FGFRs at IC50 concentrations of 180 nM or greater
(47).

Histology

Fixed tissues were decalciﬁed for up to 1 week (depending on age)
in 20% EDTA at 4°C, followed by dehydration by graded ethanol
series, cleared in xylenes (or Histo-Clear for β-galactosidase
staining, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA, USA) and embedded
in parafﬁn. Serial, 5-micron sagittal sections were cut, Histo-
Clear deparafﬁnized and rehydrated by graded ethanol series.
Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin using
standard protocols. For osteoclast analyses, sections were TRAP-
stained using standard protocols. For β-galactosidase staining,
tissues were stained prior to ﬁxation using standard protocols.
Brieﬂy, tissues were washed with phosphate buffered 0.02%
NP-40, 0.01% deoxycholate and 2 m MgCl2 followed by overnight
incubation in β-galactosidase staining solution ( phosphate
buffered 0.02% NP-40, 0.01% deoxycholate, 2 m MgCl2, 5 m po-
tassium ferricyanide, 5 m potassium ferrocyanide and 1 mg/ml
X-Gal) at room temperature. Tissues were then ﬁxed, decalciﬁed,
processed and sectioned as described earlier. Sections were
counterstained with nuclear fast red.

The Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) approved all animal procedures. To generate
DblCol2cKO mice, we employed a two-armed breeding scheme
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). In arm one, we bred Col2a1-
Cre;Fgfr1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf1ﬂox/+ males with Fgfr1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf1ﬂox/+ females to

Histomorphometric analyses

Histomorphometric measurements were performed using the
Bioquant Analysis System (BIOQUANT Image Analysis Corpor-
ation, Nashville, TN, USA). To determine the width of the prolif-
eration and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate, we used the

2562 | Human Molecular Genetics, 2015, Vol. 24, No. 9

BIOQUANT software to employ a direct measurement technique.
Speciﬁcally, the border of a zone and the border which constitu-
tes the interface between adjacent zones were identiﬁed manually
by blinded, properly trained laboratory members. The border be-
tween resting chondrocytes and the proliferation zone was de-
ﬁned by the appearance of a proliferative column of four or
more chondrocytes of ﬂattened morphology. The interface be-
tween the proliferation zone and hypertrophic zones was deﬁned
by the appearance of cells of larger size (hypertrophy) at the distal
end of proliferative columns. The termination of the hypertroph-
ic zone was deﬁned as the interface between hypertrophic chon-
drocytes and the primary spongiosa. Along each deﬁned border,
BIOQUANT software selected a set of systematically random
points with a ﬁxed interval set by the laboratory member. For
the neighborhood around each of these points, BIOQUANT com-
puted a vector orthogonal to the interface. Each vector was ex-
tended across each respective zone until it intersected the
opposite border; the length of each vector was recorded. The
width of the zone was then reported as the mean of all such vec-
tors. The width measured by this technique does not attempt to
compensate for oblique sectioning, however, all sections in-
cluded for measurement were orthogonally sectioned and at a
similar position within each bone. The osteochondral border sur-
face used for osteoclast measurements was manually deﬁned by
blinded, properly trained laboratory members as the interface be-
tween the hypertrophic chondrocyte and primary spongiosa
compartments, across the entire bone element. Once the inter-
face between these two zones was deﬁned, BIOQUANT computed
the length of the interface using standard 2-dimensional dis-
tance computations to generate a surface measurement. TRAP-
positive osteoclasts in contact with this osteochondral border
were counted for analyses.

In situ hybridization (ISH)

Tissues were ﬁxed, decalciﬁed, processed and sectioned as de-
scribed earlier. Sections were stored at 4°C until use. ISH was per-
formed by standard protocols. Fgfr1, Fgfr3, Ihh ISH was performed
using probes to the respective 3′ UTRs (Fgfr1 and Fgfr3 sequences
available upon request, Ihh as previously published) (62). Nf1 ISH
was performed using a probe to the 5′ translated region of the
mRNA (40). Sense and anti-sense [35S]-uridine triphosphate (Per-
kin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) probes were synthesized for hy-
bridization as described previously (62,63). Sections were
stained with Hoechst 33258 to identify nuclei. Images were pro-
cessed using Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA, USA).

Immunohistochemistry

Tissues were ﬁxed, decalciﬁed, processed and sectioned as
described earlier. Antigens were retrieved on graded ethanol rehy-
drated sections using DeCal Retrieval Solution per manufacturer’s
instructions (Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA). Immunostaining was
performed using standard protocols with anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK (Erk1/2, Thr202/Tyr204, E10 mouse mAb #9106, Cell Signal-
ing, Boston, MA, USA) antibodies or non-immune IgG1 antibodies,
followed by ImmPACT NovaRED (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA) horseradish peroxidase detection of the secondary
antibody. Immunostained sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin.

appropriate primers. The Nf1 ﬂoxed allele was detected with pri-
mers P1, P3 and P4, as previously described (60). The Fgfr1 ﬂoxed
allele was detected with primers intr5.53 and intr5.53 to generate
a 750 bp band for the ﬂoxed allele and a 564 bp band for the WT
allele, as previously described (61). The Col2-Cre transgene was
detected using the forward primer: GAGTTGATAGCTGGCT
GGTGGCAGATG and reverse: TCCTCCTGCTCCTAGGGCCTCCTG
CAT to generate a 700 bp band (59). The Col10-Cre transgene was
detected using the P1 and P5 primers to generate a 305 bp band,
as previously described (42). Total RNA was extracted from snap-
frozen P5 (to avoid the presence of the secondary ossiﬁcation
center) murine growth plates (1 distal femoral epiphysis and 1
proximal tibial epiphysis per sample) using TRIzol (Life Tech-
nologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and cDNAs were synthesized
from 1 microgram RNAs following DNase I treatment using the
high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed
using TaqMan gene expression assays. The probe and primer
sets for Rankl (Mm00441908_m1), Opg (Mm00435462_m1), Fgfr1
(Mm00438924_m1), Fgfr3 (Mm00433294_m1) and the normalizer
Hprt (Mm00446968_m1) were obtained from Life Technologies. Nor-
malized fold-expression values for Rankl, Opg, Fgfr1 and Fgfr3 were
calculated using relative starting quantity values obtained using
standard curve qPCR and normalized by relative starting quantity
values obtained from standard curve Hprt qPCR.

Statistical analysis

All experimental values were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM
(v6.0, La Jolla, CA, USA). When experimental conditions involved
two groups, an unpaired t-test was used to determine differences
between groups with signiﬁcance determined by obtaining a
P-value of <0.05. When experimental conditions involved three
or more groups, one-way ANOVA was used to determine differ-
ences between groups. If differences were detected by ANOVA
(P < 0.05), post hoc signiﬁcance was calculated by Holm-Sidak’s
method correcting for multiple comparisons with signiﬁcance
determined by obtaining an adjusted P-value of <0.05. For ana-
lyses tracking body length and weight, repeated measure two-
way ANOVA was used; post hoc calculated signiﬁcance, if any, is
graphed only for the terminal time point (P18). Graphs of growth
plate zone lengths were graphed as grouped analyses for space
saving purposes but were analyzed by one-way ANOVA at each
time point speciﬁed. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
