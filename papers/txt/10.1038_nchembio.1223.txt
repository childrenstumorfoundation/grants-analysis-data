In  contrast  to  studies  on  class  I  histone  deacetylase  (HDAC)  inhibitors,  the  elucidation  of  the  molecular  mechanisms  and  
therapeutic potential of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9) is impaired by the lack of potent and selective  
chemical probes. Here we report the discovery of inhibitors that fill this void with an unprecedented metal-binding group,  
trifluoromethyloxadiazole  (TFMO),  which  circumvents  the  selectivity  and  pharmacologic  liabilities  of  hydroxamates.  
We confirm direct metal binding of the TFMO through crystallographic approaches and use chemoproteomics to demonstrate  
the  superior  selectivity  of  the  TFMO  series  relative  to  a  hydroxamate-substituted  analog.  We  further  apply  these  tool  
compounds to reveal gene regulation dependent on the catalytic active site of class IIa HDACs. The discovery of these inhibitors 
challenges the design process for targeting metalloenzymes through a chelating metal-binding group and suggests therapeutic 
potential for class IIa HDAC enzyme blockers distinct in mechanism and application compared to current HDAC inhibitors. 

Class IIa HDACs are poorly understood as epigenetic metal-

loenzymes,  suffering  both  from  a  misnomer  (histones  are 
not their substrates, and they are not efficient deacetylases) 
and  a  lack  of  pharmacological  tools  to  specifically  probe  their 
activity1,2.  In  fact,  despite  rich  characterizations  of  thousands  of 
acetylation  sites  at  the  whole-cell  level,  the  proposed  substrates 
of class IIa HDACs have only been identified in engineered over-
expression systems3–5. The field has come to accept a noncatalytic 
role for class IIa HDACs, where partnering with HDAC3 provides 
the  deacetylase  activity,  and  signal-dependent  phosphorylation 
in  the  noncatalytic  half  of  the  protein  regulates  participation  in 
co-repressor  complexes2,6–9.  Until  a  widely  accepted,  endogenous 
enzymatic  substrate  is  discovered  for  class  IIa  HDACs,  the  pre-
dominant hypothesis is that the catalytic domain serves an acetylly-
sine  ‘reader’  function  analogous  to  bromodomains10.  Interest  in 
these proteins as drug targets persists owing to genetic approaches 
implicating  class  IIa  HDACs  in  a  diverse  range  of  indications 
including alopecia, Huntington’s disease, glucose homeostasis, mus-
cular dystrophies, autoimmunity and ischemic stroke11–16. However,  
targeted deletion and RNAi studies reported to date have not dis-
tinguished  the  scaffolding  function  of  the  noncatalytic  domain 
from the orphan catalytic activity or acetyllysine reader function. 
Furthermore, genome-wide association studies cannot determine 
whether  there  is  a  causal  link  between  the  gene  and  the  risk  of  
disease.  Without  the  complementary  pharmacological  studies,  
class  IIa  HDAC  enzymes  remain  intriguing  but  poorly  validated 
targets for a variety of human diseases.

Although class I HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat and romidepsin) 
have advanced to clinical success in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and 
have been closely followed by pan-HDAC inhibitors in late clinical 
trials, the toolbox of chemical probes is still devoid of potent and 
selective  inhibitors  of  class  IIa  HDACs1.  This  gap  partially  stems 
from the debated catalytic activity of these enzymes but has most 
likely  persisted  because  of  the  unfavorable  pharmaceutical  prop-
erties  of  hydroxamate-containing  compounds.  Their  poor  phar-
macokinetics  (rapid  clearance)  and  selectivity  profiles  (multiple 
off-target interactions, including the hERG cardiac ion channel) are 
red flags on the path of drug development, particularly in disease 
indications that are not life threatening. Additionally, owing to the 
strength of a hydroxamate–metal ion interaction, target selectivity 
becomes  a  considerable  challenge  in  the  ability  to  design  potent 
inhibitors  for  metalloenzyme  targets  (such  as  HDACs,  matrix  
metalloproteases  and  TNF-α–converting  enzyme)  when  working 
with this metal-binding group (MBG)17,18.

In this study, we discovered a distinct series of class IIa HDAC 
inhibitors  containing  a  trifluoromethyloxadiazolyl  moiety  as  a 
nonchelating MBG, as verified through crystallographic methods. 
We then demonstrated the target specificity afforded by the TFMO 
using  chemoproteomic  approaches  and  used  these  cell-active  
chemical probes to identify the consequences of acutely inhibiting 
class  IIa  HDAC  catalytic  activity  in  primary  human  cells.  These 
chemical probes are important tools in the HDAC inhibitor field, 
creating an opportunity for the precise dissection of class IIa HDAC 
catalytic  and/or  acetyllysine  reader  activity  from  the  scaffolding

Identification of cell-active class IIa HDAC inhibitors
The  characterization  of  trifluoroacetyllysine  as  a  viable  substrate 
for class IIa HDACs allowed us to initiate a high-throughput screen 
(HTS) to identify inhibitors of in vitro recombinant HDAC9 cata-
lytic  activity1,19.  Approximately  2  million  individual  compounds 
from GlaxoSmithKline’s diversity collection were screened at a final 
concentration of 10 μM in batches of 100–200 1,536-well plates per 
screen run (HTS results and statistics are detailed in Supplementary 
Results, Supplementary Table 1). Compounds were evaluated for 
activity  in  the  primary  HTS  assay,  and  a  normal  distribution  of 
activity was observed across the 1,415 assay plates that comprised 
the campaign (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Hits were defined at the 
plate  level  using  a  robust  3-s.d.  cutoff  calculated  for  the  DMSO 
control wells. The average cutoff for the screen was >28% inhibi-
tion, and a hit rate of 0.5% was obtained. Hits were narrowed on 
the basis of their promiscuity in other HTS campaigns (see descrip-
tion  of  inhibition  frequency  index  (IFI)  in  Online  Methods)  and 
availability, yielding 8,955 compounds for confirmation at a final 
concentration of 10 μM in duplicate experiments (Supplementary  
Fig. 1b). In either of the confirmation runs, 2,561 compounds dem-
onstrated greater than 20% inhibition and were marked as confirmed 
hits. These compounds, along with 302 that were not confirmed but 
were active in the primary screen (>40% inhibition), were tested in 
dose-response assays (11-point, three-fold serial dilution, 100 μM 
top concentration in duplicate experiments). There were 442 com-
pounds that had average half-maximum inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) values of 100 μM or lower, and there was a clear correlation 
between  percent  inhibition  in  the  primary  HTS  and  IC50  values 
from dose-response studies (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

The  confirmed,  dose-dependent  HDAC9  inhibitors  were  clus-
tered by structural similarity and ranked on the basis of their cal-
culated  physical  properties  and  IFI.  A  high-priority  subset  was 
reconfirmed in the dose-response assay and tested in an interfer-
ence assay (to identify compounds active in the detection system, 
not true HDAC9 inhibitors; Online Methods). On the basis of these 
rankings  and  filters,  we  selected  ten  compounds  representing  six 
chemical series for LC/MS to confirm their identities and purities, 
and physicochemical profiling (chromatographic LogD at pH 7.4 
and solubility in aqueous solution). Molecules in the series repre-
sented by the most potent hit identified in the HTS, TMP269 (1) 
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note), all contained a TFMO, lacked 
any previously reported MBG and accounted for 43 out of 94 com-
pounds with an IC50 less than 10 μM, including three out of the four 
most potent HTS hits (representative molecules demonstrating the 
range of HDAC9 potency in the TMP269 series are described in 
Supplementary Table 2)20–22.

The activity profile of TMP269 across HDAC1–11 in recombi-
nant enzyme inhibition assays demonstrated its markedly selective 
inhibition of class IIa HDACs (Fig. 1b, Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table 3). Furthermore, the inhibition of all four class IIa HDACs 
was  confirmed  on  a  microfluidics  platform  with  an  alternate 
 substrate-fluorophore combination to address concerns of substrate- 
dependent  artifacts  (Supplementary  Fig.  2).  The  potency  and 
selectivity  measured  in  recombinant  HDAC  enzyme  assays  were 
maintained when tested in endogenous HDACs in a human acute 
monocytic  leukemia  cell  line  (THP-1)  using  class-distinguishing 
substrates in a whole-cell assay. Trichostatin A, vorinostat and enti-
nostat  were  found  to  inhibit  class  I  and/or  IIb  HDACs,  whereas 
TMP269 only inhibited detrifluoroacetylation of the class IIa HDAC 
substrate (Fig. 1c,d). Inhibition of endogenous class I HDAC activity  
may  also  be  assessed  by  the  accumulation  of  acetylated  histone

 proteins,  as  determined  by  western  blotting  for  acetylated  Lys9 
in histone H3 protein. Consistent with the selectivity observed in 
the  recombinant  enzyme  and  whole-cell  assays,  it  was  clear  that 
the  potent  class  IIa  HDAC  inhibitors  TMP269  and  TMP195  (2) 
did not affect this readout of class I HDAC activity (Fig. 1e and 
Supplementary  Fig.  3).  Given  the  number  of  reports  highlight-
ing the cytotoxicity of known HDAC inhibitors, we next compared 
the  relative  effects  on  cell  health  among  these  four  compounds. 
Unlike  the  class  I  and/or  IIb  HDAC  inhibitors  tested,  TMP269 
had  no  impact  on  the  mitochondrial  activity  and/or  the  viabil-
ity  of  human  CD4+  T  cells  at  concentrations  as  high  as  10  μM  
(Supplementary Fig. 4).

Structural characterization of class IIa HDAC inhibitors
We used crystallographic methods to further our understanding of 
how these TFMO-containing molecules achieved preferential inhi-
bition of class IIa HDACs. A 2.35-Å-resolution crystal structure of 
TMP269 bound to HDAC7 confirmed direct binding to the active 
site zinc and revealed an unexpected U-shaped conformation of 
the inhibitor (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary 
Table  4).  The  differences  in  the  catalytic  pockets  of  class  I  and  
class IIa HDACs are well described, in particular the replacement 
of a key class I and IIb tyrosine residue with a histidine in class IIa 
(His843 in HDAC7)19,23,24. This substitution not only affects their 
catalytic activity but also enables class IIa HDACs to accommodate 
bulkier molecules compared to other HDACs. Thus, we propose 
that selectivity for class IIa HDACs is at least partly due to the size 
of the TFMO, which is able to fit well into the HDAC7 active site but 
is unlikely to be accommodated by class I HDACs without consid-
erable structural rearrangements. The TFMO is clearly the MBG,

as one of its fluorine atoms and its oxygen (to our surprise, not 
the nitrogen, as is typically seen in small-molecule crystal struc-
tures of metal oxadiazoles) interacted with the zinc at distances of 
2.7  Å  and  3.0  Å,  respectively  (Fig. 2b)25.  At  these  distances,  the 
TFMO most likely used weak electrostatic interactions in lieu of 
the  canonical  metal-chelating  geometries  seen  in  hydroxamates, 
which have typical zinc interaction distances of ~2.0 Å. TMP269 
filled the larger active site space away from the zinc, burying its 
lipophilic  tail  into  the  hydrophobic  area  of  the  pocket,  displac-
ing His843 and establishing an edge-to-face interaction between 
Phe679 and the phenyl group adjacent to the oxadiazole (Fig. 2c). 
A structural comparison of HDAC7 cocrystallized with TMP269 
or vorinostat (Protein Data Bank code 3C0Z) highlighted not only 
the  differences  in  metal-binding  character  but  also  a  large  vol-
ume of the catalytic site that is only exploited by the more potent 
TMP269 (Fig. 2d)23. Taken together, the crystallographic evidence 
suggested that the combination of a bulky but modest MBG and 
the  U-shaped  conformation  conferred  selective  class  IIa  HDAC 
inhibition in the TMP269 series. It also provided evidence that a 
strong metal-chelating warhead was not required for potency and 
that a weaker replacement can be an asset in the design of selective 
metalloenzyme inhibitors.

A TFMO-to-hydroxamate swap introduces off-target binding
From the biochemical and crystallographic evidence, we hypothe-
sized that the weaker MBG character of the TFMO would translate 
into fewer off-target interactions than are reported for a hydroxam-
ate MBG26. Indeed, when tested for activity in recombinant enzyme 
assays of matrix metalloproteinase 9 or 12 activity, TMP269 did not 
yield IC50 values in dose-response experiments with a top concentra-
tion of 50 μM. To extend our test of this hypothesis to a proteome-
wide query of potential interactions, we conducted stable isotope 
labeling  by  amino  acids  in  cell  culture  (SILAC)-based  quantita-
tive  proteomics  combined  with  affinity  enrichment  using  lysates 
from THP-1 cells (selected on the basis of the ability to detect and 
inhibit endogenous class IIa HDAC activity in these cells) compar-
ing a TFMO compound, its hydroxamate ortholog and an ortholog 
devoid of an MBG. For this study, we selected TMP942 (3) to rep-
resent the TFMO series as its methyl amine provided a convenient 
solvent-exposed handle to allow facile attachment to resin without 
loss of class IIa HDAC potency and minimal differences in protein-
bound conformation when compared to TMP269 (Supplementary 
Figs. 6 and 7 and Supplementary Table 6). TMP974 (4) swaps a 
hydroxamate for the TFMO MBG of TMP942 and therefore loses 

potent class IIa HDAC inhibition, whereas TMP373 (5) served as 
the negative control soluble ‘competitor’ because it lacks a metal-
binding moiety (Supplementary Fig. 6). The HDAC1–11 inhibition 
activity of the three soluble competitors used in the SILAC experi-
ments are described in Figure 1b and Table 1, and their synthesis 
and attachment to resin are described in the Supplementary Note.

Excess  (75  μM)  unbound  TMP942  specifically  competed  off  
HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC7 from TMP942 affinity resin treated 
with  THP-1  lysates  (Fig.  3a).  HDAC10  was  also  displaced  by 
TMP942;  however,  this  interaction  was  most  likely  independent 
of  the  MBG  as  it  was  competed  off  by  excess  (75  μM)  TMP373 
(Supplementary  Fig.  8)  and  is  potentially  allosteric  because 
TMP942  did  not  inhibit  HDAC10  catalytic  activity.  In  contrast,  
75 μM TMP974 specifically displaced nine proteins but no HDACs 
(consistent  with  the  lack  of  activity  in  the  biochemical  assays) 
from  immobilized  TMP974,  with  a  propensity  for  interacting 
with known metal ion–binding proteins (six out of nine binders;  
Fig. 3b). The data for TMP974 were consistent with reported off-
 target  activities  of  hydroxamates,  but  the  skewed  distribution  of 
protein  fold  changes  for  TMP974  led  us  to  confirm  the  relative 
  on-  and  off-target  specificities  for  both  MBGs  in  HEK293  cell 
lysates for targets present in that proteome (Supplementary Fig. 9). 
The  cell  lysates  used  in  these  experiments  contained  solubilized 
class  I  HDACs  (HDAC1  and  HDAC2  were  detected  by  tandem 
MS in the resin washes from both THP-1 and HEK293 cell lysates; 
Supplementary Table 7),  but  they  were  not  selectively  competed 
off by TMP942. In contrast, this approach did not yield detectable 
class IIa HDAC peptides in washes of the HEK lysates (or HDAC9 
in the THP-1 lysates), evidence that these proteins were in very low 
abundance in these extracts. Notably, we could not observe the dis-
placement of any proteins reported to form complexes with class 
IIa HDACs (for example, HDAC3, despite also being detected by 
tandem MS in input lysates). This observation was consistent with 
recent  chemoproteomic  approaches  where  class  IIa  HDACs  were 
absent from HDAC3 complexes specifically bound to class I or IIb 
inhibitor matrices26. Although the absence of any detectable off-target 
interactions from two separate proteomes cannot confirm that com-
pounds in the TFMO series are entirely specific for class IIa HDACs, 
the data added a high degree of confidence when these chemical

gene expression influenced by class IIa HDAC inhibitors
The current models of class IIa HDAC–regulated gene expression 
are based entirely on the noncatalytic function of these proteins, 
bringing  the  epigenetic  enzyme  classification  of  these  proteins 
into  question8,27.  For  example,  histone  deacetylation–dependent 
activation of gene expression involving HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 
or  HDAC9  has  been  shown  to  require  the  catalytic  activity  of 
HDAC3  (refs.  2,6).  Furthermore,  the  phosphorylation-regulated 
14-3-3 binding domains in the N-terminal portions (noncatalytic 
domains)  of  class  IIa  HDACs  regulate  their  participation  in  co- 
repressor  complexes7.  Little  is  known  about  how  the  conserved 
catalytic  or  reader  domain,  particularly  the  acetyllysine-binding 
site, affects these interactions. Enabled by the potency and selec-
tivity of the chemical tools described above, we pursued a pharma-
cological approach to address the less-understood contributions of 
the class IIa HDAC catalytic domains’ acetyllysine-binding pocket 
or catalytic active site in regulating gene expression. We performed 
whole-genome  transcriptional  profiling  on  phytohemaggluti-
nin (PHA)-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) to identify genes affected by a class IIa HDAC inhibi-
tor, TMP195 (Fig. 4a). This compound was selected to represent 
the TFMO series in the subsequent cell-based assays because of 
its activity in cell-based class IIa HDAC assays (IC50 = 300 nM) 
and  low  potency  in  recombinant  class  I  and  IIb  HDAC  assays, 
enabling full inhibition of class IIa HDAC activity without inhibi-
tion of other HDACs. Only 16 and 60 genes were up- or downreg-
ulated by a factor of ≥1.4, respectively, by TMP195 in the PBMCs 
of two unique donors, a marked contrast to the number of genes 
affected by vorinostat in this system (1,853 and 2,703 genes up- or 
downregulated by a factor of ≥1.4 in both specimens, respectively; 
Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data Sets 1 and 2). The majority of 
TFMO-affected genes (54 out of 76) were downregulated by vor-
inostat, most likely because of this HDAC inhibitor’s effects on cell 
viability (and monocyte–B cell–T cell proportionality) that were 
not observed for TMP195 (Supplementary Fig. 10)28. The genes 
affected  by  class  IIa  HDAC  inhibition  are  relevant  in  immune 
responses  and  include  the  altered  expression  of  chemokines, 
complement  pathway  components  and  cell-surface  interaction

molecules (Supplementary Fig. 11). Taken together, the restrained 
impact on gene expression and the absence of overt cytotoxicity in 
the  TFMO  class  IIa  HDAC  inhibitors  speak  to  the  potential  for 
limited target-related toxicities when inhibiting class IIa HDACs 
and a clear functional diversification of class IIa catalytic or reader 
activity from that of class I and IIb enzymes.

The subtle effects of TMP195 on gene expression in a hetero-
geneous mixture of cells led us to question whether they reflected 
large changes in gene expression in an infrequent cell population 
or subtle changes in abundant cell types. To address this question, 
we purified T cell (CD3+), B cell (CD19+) and monocyte (CD14+) 
populations from the PHA-stimulated PBMC system via cell sort-
ing (Supplementary Fig. 12) and subjected them to whole-genome 
expression profiling. This approach revealed that most of the 76 
genes  identified  in  the  unfractionated  PBMC  are  both  highly 
expressed  and  remain  differentially  affected  only  in  the  CD14+ 
monocyte  samples  (Fig.  5a–c).  TMP195  had  minimal  effects  on 
PHA-stimulated gene expression in lymphocytes (CD3+ T cells, 4 and 
13 genes; CD19+ B cells, 7 and 29 genes up- and downregulated by 
a factor of at least 1.4, respectively, in both donors; Supplementary  
Fig. 13 and Supplementary Data Sets 3 and 4). This unexpectedly 
low number of genes affected by class IIa HDAC inhibitors in lym-
phocytes  was  echoed  in  human  T-cell  proliferation  experiments, 
as  no  genes  were  detected  as  up-  or  downregulated  by  TMP269 
treatment by more than a factor of two (Supplementary Fig. 14). 
In sharp contrast, CD14+ monocytes were clearly transcriptionally 
sensitive to inhibition of class IIa HDAC catalytic activity in the 
context of PHA stimulation (443 and 144 genes up- and downreg-
ulated, respectively; Supplementary Data Set 5). This sensitivity 
was not easily reconciled by an obvious, highly expressed class IIa 
HDAC in monocytes, as HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC7 have similar 
transcript levels in this same data set (Supplementary Table 8). The 
most differentially expressed chemokine and cell-surface genes are 
more abundant in monocytes than in lymphocytes and are many of 
the same genes identified in the PBMC culture. However, purifying 
the CD14+ cells before transcriptional profiling enabled us to iden-
tify genes affected by class IIa HDAC enzyme inhibitors missed in 
the mixed culture because of their high, TFMO-insensitive expres-
sion in lymphocytes. These transcripts were mostly upregulated by 
TMP195 and had an over-representation of genes involved in cell 
proliferation  and  protein  translation.  These  expression  profiling 
results  were  the  first  clear  identification  of  transcriptional  read-
outs  influenced  by  endogenous  class  IIa  HDAC  enzyme  activity 
and suggested that human monocytes are particular in their use of 

Class IIa HDACs affect colony-stimulating factor responses
Having identified monocytes as sensitive to class IIa HDAC inhibi-
tors in the context of a nonspecific agglutination stimulus applied to 
a complex mixture of cells, we pursued their effects in a more spe-
cific in vitro setting. Although TMP195 is among the most potent 
and selective class IIa HDAC inhibitors we have identified, TMP058 
(6) is one of the weakest in the TFMO series and served as a control 
compound in the TFMO series in subsequent experiments (Fig. 1b, 
Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Treatment of human 
peripheral blood monocytes with macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1) leads to the well-characterized 
differentiation of these cells into monocyte-derived macrophages, 
expressing  many  tissue  macrophage  signature  genes,  including 
the  monocyte  and  basophil  chemoattractant  chemokine  ligand  2 
(CCL2)29.  TMP195,  but  not  TMP058,  blocked  the  accumulation 
of CCL2 protein in the supernatants of monocyte-derived macro-
phage  differentiation  cultures  (Fig.  6a).  Recent  studies  demon-
strate  that  when  granulocyte/monocyte  colony-stimulating  factor 
(GM-CSF, also known as CSF2) is added to the monocyte culture 
with M-CSF, CCL2 expression is inhibited, and several other genes 
(including CCL1) are induced30. TMP195, but not TMP058, signi-
ficantly  (two-way  analysis  of  variance,  P  <  0.0001)  increased  the 
amount of CCL1 protein secreted by the monocytes compared to 
vehicle (DMSO)-treated M-CSF plus GM-CSF cultures (Fig. 6b). 
The impact of class IIa HDAC inhibition on the expression of these 
chemokines was consistent with the transcriptional profiling data 
from  the  PHA-stimulated  PBMC  experiments,  where  CCL2  and 
CCL1 were respectively identified as down- or upregulated TMP195 
(Supplementary Figs. 11 and 13).

DISCuSSION
The current study introduces an unprecedented series of class IIa 
HDAC inhibitors, from their identification in a HTS to their impact 
on activation phenotypes of human monocytes. A key aspect of this 
work is the discovery of the trifluoromethyloxadiazolyl moiety as 
a  new  MBG  enabling  target  specificity  and  overcoming  pharma-
cologic  limitations  of  zinc-chelating  groups  used  in  other  metal-
loenzyme inhibitors. This discovery exemplifies a new paradigm in 
the design of metalloenzyme inhibitors that challenges the dogma 
of  establishing  potency  through  a  chelating  warhead.  Although 
the strength of a chelating interaction drives inhibitor binding, it 
becomes  a  disadvantage  when  considering  strategies  to  engineer 
selectivity using other parts of the compound if only much weaker 
interactions with the target are available. TMP269 and its analogs 
demonstrate how the tempered approach of supporting a weaker 
MBG with multiple other compound-target interactions can be a 
successful  strategy  in  the  discovery  of  metalloenzyme  inhibitors 
with exceptional selectivity. Furthermore, overcoming the need for 
a hydroxamate to achieve potency opens the door to explore human 
disease  indications  where  off-target  activities  and  pharmacologic 
liabilities of a chelating MBG outweigh the therapeutic benefit to 
the patient.

We were struck by the absence of apparent protein complexes co-
eluting with class IIa HDACs. Not only are they reported to associate 
with HDAC3 in coimmunoprecipitations, but our lysate preparations 
were based on prior work in which class I and IIb HDAC inhibitor 
matrices clearly identify many HDAC interactors26. Perhaps com-
plexes were absent because the TMP942 matrix is only able to bind 
‘free’ class IIa HDACs—a scenario in which the acetyllysine-binding 
site is occupied when these proteins are in a stable complex. In con-
trast, the absence of class IIa HDAC co-eluting proteins may have 
been predicted by the previous study, as class IIa HDACs were not 
identified as members of HDAC3-containing complexes. It remains 
possible  that  class  IIa  HDACs  in  complex  with  other  proteins  
renders  them  unavailable  (insoluble)  in  these  lysis  conditions. 
Clearly, further work is required to elucidate the endogenous part-
ners of the class IIa HDACs in cells, as these independent studies 
have generated complementary data sets that do not demonstrate 
their participation in classical co-repressor complexes.

These inhibitors enable a precise pharmacological route to char-
acterizing the biological relevance of class IIa HDAC catalytic or 
acetyllysine reader activity that builds upon the genetic approaches 
defining  the  field  and  leading  many  groups  to  propose  that  the 
catalytic  activity  of  these  proteins  is  vestigial6,8,31.  Even  without  
‘de-orphaning’  the  enzymatic  activity  of  class  IIa  HDACs,  this 
study serves to redefine these metalloenzyme or acetyllysine reader 
domains as distinct targets for pharmacologic intervention that are 
clearly differentiated from class I and/or IIb or pan-HDAC inhibi-
tors. For instance, in all of the cell-based assays described above, 
the TFMO compounds lacked one of the hallmarks of class I and/or 
IIb HDAC inhibitor activity: cell death or apoptosis. For vorinostat, 
this activity is most likely a contributing factor to the therapeutic 
efficacy in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but it may also be associ-
ated with dose-limiting adverse events32. Furthermore, unlike what 
is reported for class I and IIb HDAC inhibition, inhibiting class IIa 
HDAC activity had very little impact on gene expression in lympho-
cytes33. These contrasts to the activity of vorinostat provide evidence 
that class IIa HDACs are not likely to be classical epigenetic enzymes 
affecting chromatin structure and gene expression in every cell type. 
However, the clear and consistent effects of TMP195 on monocyte 
responses to a mitogen (PHA), M-CSF and GM-CSF are evidence 
that the function performed by the catalytic or reader domain is 
not a vestige of evolution. We propose that TFMO inhibitors in the 
TMP269  series  may  be  used  as  tools  to  identify  the  endogenous 
substrates of the class IIa HDAC enzymes, the loci whose regula-
tion directly incorporates class IIa HDAC reader activity or both 

and may be suitable for drug development efforts in immune dis-
ease indications for which class I and/or IIb HDAC inhibitors are  
not appropriate.

Recombinant HDAC9 enzyme activity assay development. Enzyme and sub-
strate used for high-throughput screening (HTS) were purchased from BPS 
Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, California): HDAC9 (BPS catalog number 50009) 
and  HDAC  class  IIa  substrate  (BPS  catalog  number  50040).  Recombinant 
HDAC9 isoform 4 of human HDAC9 (GenBank accession number NM_178423, 
amino acids 604–1066 with C-terminal His tag, MW = 50.7 kDa) was expressed 
and purified in a baculovirus expression system. In this assay, a class IIa HDAC 
substrate was detrifluoroacetylated by HDAC9. Trichostatin A was then added 
to quench the HDAC9 activity, and the reaction was developed by the addition 
of trypsin to release the fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from 
the detrifluoroacetylated substrate. Optimal detection of fluorescence inten-
sity, as measured in plate readers (EnVision, PerkinElmer; Acquest or Analyst, 
LJL BioSystems), was determined at excitation and emission wavelengths of 
340 nm and 435 nm, respectively, via spectrum scans. After the addition of 
trichostatin A and trypsin, the signal was stable for up to 3 h with >90% of 
fluorescence intensity maintained. Assay plates can be read during this time 
period with little change of assay statistics (signal/base ratio, Z). All reactions 
were  evaluated  at  ambient  temperature  in  assay  buffer  solution  containing  
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA 
and 0.005% Tween-20. Substrate and enzyme kinetic parameters were deter-
mined by performing reaction velocity experiments. Rates were determined 
from the slope of the linear portion of time-dependent progress curves in a 
series of end-point reactions using 4.7 nM HDAC9. Saturation curves show-
ing the relation between the concentration of substrate and enzyme velocity 
were then plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, 
Inc.)  with  Michaelis-Menten  kinetics.  The  Kcat  of  HDAC9  was  determined 
to be in the range of 0.17–0.35/sec, and the Km of HDAC class IIa substrate 
was determined to be in the range of 4.4 μM to 11 μM. The final concentra-
tions of HDAC9 and class IIa HDAC substrate in the screen were chosen to be  
2.5  nM  and  4.5  μM,  respectively,  to  maximize  the  assay’s  ability  to  detect 
HDAC9 inhibitors. The DMSO tolerance for the assay was determined, and no 
effect on enzyme activity was found up to 5% final concentration.

For inhibitor compound testing, the HDAC9 assay was first configured in 
a low-volume 384-well assay format using Greiner black plates. Specifically, 
5 μL of 5 nM HDAC9 in assay buffer was added to the plates with 100 nL  
of  compounds  at  various  concentration  predispensed  in  100%  DMSO.  
Five microliters of 9 μM class IIa HDAC substrate in assay buffer was then 
added per well. The final concentrations of HDAC9 and class IIa HDAC sub-
strate in the plate were 2.5 nM and 4.5 μM, respectively. After incubation for 
45 min at room temperature, 10 mL of 2× developer solution (40 μM trypsin, 
20 μM trichostatin A in buffer) was added per well. Plates were covered and 
incubated for another hour at room temperature before detection of fluores-
cence intensity. The assay was then miniaturized to 1,536-well format. Assay 
robustness studies were conducted to ensure comparable performance and 
tolerance to production scale liquid handling. Assay performance, such as 
signal to background ratios and Z′ values, was assessed, and quality was either 
retained or enhanced in 1,536-well format.

Validation and execution of the HDAC9 inhibitor HTS. All steps of the HTS 
were done in a 1,536-well plate format using black 1,536-well Greiner microtiter 
plates (catalog number 782076) with the following assay conditions: 50 nL of 
test compound in 100% DMSO or DMSO control was dispensed per well using 
Echo Acoustic Dispenser (Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale, California) before the addi-
tion of biological reagent. A Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, 
Massachusetts)  was  used  for  all  subsequent  liquid  additions.  Assay  buffer  
(2.5 μL) was first added to columns 35 and 36 as control wells, and then 2.5 μL  
of  5  nM  HDAC9  in  assay  buffer  were  added  to  columns  1–34  and  37–48.  
Class IIa HDAC substrate in assay buffer (9 μM, 2.5 μL) was then added per 
well to the entire plate. The final concentrations of HDAC9 and class IIa HDAC  
substrate  in  the  plate  were  2.5  nM  and  4.5  μM,  respectively.  After  incuba-
tion for 45 min at room temperature, 3 μL of 2.7× developer solution (53 μM 
trypsin, 26.5  μM trichostatin A in buffer) were added per well. Plates were  
covered and incubated for another hour at room temperature before being read 
on an Envision plate reader.

Before the actual start of HTS, a set of approximately 10,000 compounds 
was tested in triplicate using the assay conditions described above to validate 
the HTS protocol. Using robust statistics, a predicted hit rate and confirmation 
rate were calculated on the basis of a predicted robust 3 × s.d. (3SD) cutoff of 

20% inhibition on all three data sets. The predicted hit rate and confirmation 
rate were 0.3% and 56%, respectively.

All 1,536-well HTS assay–ready plates were provided by GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK)’s  Sample  Management  Technology  group.  All  single-concentration 
testing (screen validation, primary and confirmation) was done with a final 
compound concentration of 10 μM in the reaction by dispensing 50 nL of 
1 mM compound stock solution. Dose-response studies were done with 11 
concentrations in a three-fold dilution series, resulting in a maximum final 
compound concentration of 100 μM.

IFI.  The  IFI  was  calculated  for  each  compound  using  the  equation  below. 
Historic screens done in GSK (full diversity or focused screen) in inhibition 
assay  formats  were  included  in  the  analysis.  Screens  against  kinases  were 
excluded from the list. Target hit calling was based on robust 3SD statistic cut-
off of percent inhibition on the target.

IFI = (number of targets hit/number of targets screened) × 100

Interference assay. An interference assay was run after the dose-response ana-
lysis to eliminate compounds that inhibit the coupling detection system instead 
of HDAC activity. In this assay, HDAC9 and the class IIa HDAC substrate were 
preincubated for 45 min at room temperature before 5 μL of the reaction mix-
ture per well was dispensed into the assay-ready plate containing 50 nL of test 
compound per well. The final concentrations of HDAC9 and class IIa HDAC 
substrate in the preincubation mixture were 2.5 nM and 4.5 μM, respectively. 
Three microliters of developer solution (53 μM trypsin, 26.5 μM trichostatin A 
in buffer) were then added immediately per well. Plates were covered and incu-
bated for one hour at room temperature. The plates were read on an Envision 
plate reader using the same protocol as the HDAC9 assay.

Screening  data  analysis.  Assay  performance  statistics,  such  as  signal  to 
background  ratio,  Z′  and  robust  3SD  activity  cutoff  were  calculated  using 
AbaseXE (IDBS, Guilford, Surrey, UK). Hit population analysis and visuali-
zation were conducted using Spotfire DecisionSite (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, 
Massachusetts). Activity-weighted diversity selection, IFI, chemical property 
analysis and structural clustering were used to rationally reduce the number 
of compounds tested in follow-up studies. IC50 values were obtained using the 
nonlinear regression function in AbaseXE’s full curve analysis bundle.

HDAC selectivity assays. Dose-response studies were done with ten concen-
trations in a threefold dilution series from a maximum final compound con-
centration of 100 μM in the reaction mixture and were conducted at Reaction 
Biology Corp. (Malvern, Pennsylvania). All assays are based on the same prin-
ciple as the HDAC9 assay described above: the deacetylation of acetylated or 
trifluoroacetylated lysine residues on fluorogenic peptide substrates by HDAC. 
HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC10 and HDAC11 used a substrate 
based  on  residues  379–382  of  p53  (Arg-His-Lys-Lys(Ac)).  For  HDAC8,  the 
diacetylated  peptide  substrate,  based  on  residues  379–382  of  p53  (Arg-His-
Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)), was used. HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9 assays used 
the class IIa HDAC–specific fluorogenic substrate (Boc-Lys(trifluoroacetyl)-
AMC). All reactions were done with 50 μM HDAC substrate in assay buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL 
BSA) containing 1% DMSO final concentration; incubated for 2 h at 30 °C; and 
developed with trichostatin A and trypsin.

Cell-based deacetylase assay. Deacetylase activity was measured in THP-1cells 
(ATCC  catalog  no.  TIB-202)  using  200  μM  class  I  or  IIb  HDAC  substrate 
(Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC), Bachem catalog no. I-1875) or 100 μM class IIa substrate 
(Boc-Lys(trifluoroacetyl)-AMC),  Bachem  catalog  no.  I-1985)  to  assess  total 
endogenous class I or IIb or class IIa HDAC activity, respectively. Cells (100,000 
per well), substrate and inhibitors were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 
assay medium (0.5% FBS, 0.5% DMSO in RPMI). The assay was developed 
by the addition of an equal volume of developer solution (2% Triton X-100,  
50 μM trichostatin A, 2.5 mg/mL trypsin in DMEM) and incubated for at least 
1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was read on a SpectraMax 
M2 (excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 nm and 435 nm, respec-
tively). Curve fitting and IC50 values were calculated using a four-parameter,  
nonlinear, robust fit equation in statistical analysis software (GraphPad Prism 
5.0, GraphPad Software, Inc.).

cultured in standard medium (10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 
10 mM HEPES, 10 U/10 mg penicillin/streptomycin) at a density of 3 × 106 per 
mL for 2 h in the presence of various HDAC inhibitors (or 0.2% v/v DMSO 
as the vehicle control). One million harvested cells were washed in ice-cold 
PBS by centrifugation and lysed in 100 μL 1× NuPAGE LDS sample loading 
buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), heated to 70 °C for 10 min and chilled 
on ice, and then DNA was sheared by repeated passing through a 27-gauge 
needle. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 40 μL of it was subjected 
to SDS-PAGE (Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and system, Life Technologies) and 
transferred onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) via standard 
western blotting techniques. Total histone H3 and H3K9Ac were recognized 
with specific antibodies (dilutions of 1:1,000, as per manufacturer’s instruc-
tion; catalog no. 3638 and no. 9671, respectively; Cell Signaling Technology) 
and visualized with mouse IgG–specific (catalog no. 35502, Thermo Scientific) 
or rabbit IgG–specific (catalog no. A4914, Sigma) secondary anti bodies (both 
1:10,000  dilutions).  Image  acquisition  and  densitometry  analysis  were  per-
formed on the FluorChem Q system using AlphaView software (Version 3.2.2.0;  
Protein Simple).

In  vitro  PBMC  culture  and  gene  expression  profiling  experiments.  Blood 
collected  from  healthy  donors  according  to  the  guidelines  of  the  American 
Association  of  Blood  Banks  and  under  an  IRB-approved  informed  consent 
form was purchased from Research Blood Components (Boston, MA). PBMC 
were isolated from healthy donors’ blood via density gradient centrifugation 
(Ficoll, Stem Cell Technologies), cultured with the described HDAC inhibi-
tors immediately before addition of PHA and harvested 60 h later. RNA was 
extracted  (Qiagen  RNAeasy  Kit)  from  total  PBMC  directly  from  these  cul-
tures or from populations sorted (BD Biosciences Aria II) on the basis of their 
expression of CD3, CD14 or CD19. RNA processing, labeling and hybridiza-
tion to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were done according to manu-
facturer’s recommendations.

MTT  cell  viability  assays.  Human  CD4+  T  cells  were  isolated  from  whole 
blood  via  negative  selection  according  to  manufacturer’s  instructions 
(RosetteSep  Human  CD4+  T  cell  enrichment  kit,  Stem  Cell  Technologies, 
Inc.), re-suspended in T-cell culture medium (10% FBS, 2 mM  L-glutamine, 
1 mM pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 10 U/10 mg penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5% 
DMSO in RPMI) and plated at 50,000 cells/well with IL-2 (10 BRMP units/mL, 
Beckton Dickinson) and 100,000 human T-expander Dynabeads (Invitrogen) 
for 72 h. Determination of mitochondrial function or cell viability was done 
according  to  manufacturer’s  instructions  (Cell  Proliferation  Assay  Kit  I 
(MTT), Roche Applied Science) and was represented as a percent of control  
(no inhibitor) wells.

Monocyte cell cultures. Human primary CD14+ monocytes were purified by 
positive selection from PBMCs using magnetic beads (Miltenyi). Monocytes 
were incubated with either 0.1% DMSO or 1 μM TMP058 or 1 μM TMP195 
for 30 min at room temperature and were then differentiated with 50 ng/ml 
M-CSF  (R&D  Systems)  and  0–270  pg/ml  GM-CSF  (R&D  Systems)  for  5  d 
(incubation in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM 
L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% 
CO2). Culture supernatants were collected after 5 d for analysis of CCL1 (R&D 
Systems catalog number DY272E) and CCL2 (MesoScale Discovery) protein 
concentrations.

Expression  and  purification  of  HDAC7  for  crystallization.  His-tagged 
HDAC7 (residues 483–903) was expressed in E. coli using a pET28a vector. 
Cells were lysed in 25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole-pH 7.5-
plus 1mM CHAPS containing 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM ZnCl2 using pressure 
homogenization. Lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 47,000g in a TZ28 rotor at  
4 °C; lysate was filtered through a Meissner 0.2-μm filter. Lysate was loaded 
on a 10 mL (2 × 5 mL) HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in  
25 mM HEPES, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5; washed with this 
buffer; then paused. On-column Thrombin cleavage was carried out overnight, 
the column was reconnected, and the immediate flow-through was collected 
and diluted 25× with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 plus 1 mM CHAPS and was loaded 
onto a 5-mL Q Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mM 
HEPES, pH 7.5. The flow-thru containing the HDAC7 was collected; put into 
a 10-mL (2 × 5 mL) Heparin column (GE Healthcare); eluted using a gradient 

from 15–60% with 25 mM HEPES; 1 M NaCl pH 7.5; and concentrated. The 
HDAC7 peak was applied to a 320 mL Superdex 75 column equilibrated in  
25 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl pH 7.5; eluted isocratically; and concentrated 
with a JumboSep 10K CO membrane.

HDAC7 crystallization and structure solution. His-tagged HDAC7 (residues  
483–903) was prepared in 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and com-
plexed  with  inhibitors  by  adding  a  ten-fold  molar  excess  of  inhibitor  to  
0.1 mM HDAC7 and then concentrated using spin dialfiltration (30,000 MW 
cut-off) to ~10 mg/mL. Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion 
at 22 °C. Eight-hundred-nanoliter drops were set with a Mosquito instrument 
(TTP LabTech; Melbourne, United Kingdom) in MRC 2 Well Crystallization 
Plates  (Swissci;  Zug,  Switzerland)  by  combining  400  nL  HDAC7–inhibitor 
complex and 400 nL of 12% PEG3350, 4% isopropanol and 50 mM HEPES, pH 
7.5. HDAC7-inhibitor complexed crystals were harvested and cryoprotected 
with 30% ethylene glycol (EG), 12% PEG3350, 4% IPA and 50 mM HEPES, 
pH 7.5, using a four-step exchange starting with 0% EG and ending with 30% 
EG. Crystals were submersed in liquid nitrogen and sent to the APS for data 
collection at beam line 21–IDG at LSCAT and were collected at 100 K and at 
a wavelength of 0.97 Å. Molecular replacement was completed using Phaser 
and a model of an in-house apo crystal structure of HDAC7 with a resolution 
of 2.2 Å. The structure was built with the program COOT, and refinement was 
completed with the program Phenix. The TMP269 crystal structure has three 
molecules in the ASU; however, the ligand is only fit in the B subunit as the 
density is incomplete in the other subunits. The TMP942 structure has all three 
subunits fit with the ligand.

Matrix metalloproteinase assays. Matrix metalloproteinase enzymatic activity  
was measured using standard techniques, where protease activity is determined 
using  a  fluorophore-peptide-quencher  substrate.  Cleavage  of  the  peptide 
releases the fluorophore from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluo-
rescent signal. MMP9 and MMP12 assay conditions: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 
150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 μM Zn(O2CCH3)2, 600 μM CHAPS, 2.25 nM 
MMP9 or 6 nM MMP12 (activated with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate before 
addition to the assay) and 1 μM MMP9 substrate (FAM/TAMRA-conjugated 
TPGPLGLARR  peptide)  or  2  μM  MMP12  (FAM/TAMRA-conjugated 
GPLGLFAR peptide). Fluorescence intensity (excitation and emission wave-
lengths were 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively; dichroic filter of 505 nm) was 
read on a Viewlux (PerkinElmer).

Affinity  enrichment  chemoproteomics  overview.  Parallel  THP-1  cell  cul-
tures were grown in either light or heavy SILAC labeling medium according to  
manufacturer’s  instructions  (Invitrogen),  and  soluble  protein  lysates  were 
adjusted to 2 mg/mL for forward and flip experiments, in which incubations 
with free or sepharose bead–immobilized inhibitors were performed. Following 
the  incubations  and  washes,  proteins  bound  to  the  beads  were  resolved  by 
gel electrophoresis and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion and peptide 
extraction. Reverse-phase liquid chromatography separations were performed 
on a Waters Nano Acquity system and introduced into the LTQ OrbiTrap XL 
using a James Scientific nanospray source, and full-scan OrbiTrap MS spectra 
were processed using the MaxQuant (version 1.1.1.25) suite of applications to 
identify and quantify SILAC pairs.

Preparation  of  lysate  from  HEK293  and  THP-1  cells  labeled  with  SILAC. 
Separate cultures of HEK293 MSRII cells grown in DMEM were labeled with 
L-arginine  and  L-lysine  (light)  or  [U-13C6]-L-lysine  and  [U-13C6,  15N4]-L-
arginine according to Invitrogen’s instructions. Light and heavy THP-1 cells 
grown in RPMI1640 were prepared similarly. HEK293 and THP-1 cells were 
dissociated from culture plates using Versene (Invitrogen), pelleted and lysed 
in  ice-cold  lysis  buffer  containing  50  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH7.5),  0.8%  Igepal-
CA630, 5% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, EDTA-free 
protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma).  
The ice-cold lysates were further homogenized on a FastPrep-24 instrument 
(MP Biomedicals) using matrix D beads (MP Biomedicals) at a speed of 6 m/s 
for 20 s. The homogenates were then centrifuged (14,000g, 4 °C, 10 min), and 
the supernatant was collected and used in the affinity-enrichment experiment 
described below.

Affinity enrichment in THP-1/HEK293 lysates. Protein concentrations of light 
and heavy lysates were measured using a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher). The lysates

to 1.5-mL Protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes. For identification of protein tar-
gets interacting with TMP942, the light lysate was preincubated with TMP942 
(75 μM; active competitor) for 45 min at 4 °C on an end-to-end rotator, and 
the heavy lysate was incubated with DMSO vehicle. Sepharose beads immobi-
lized with TMP942 (occupying 6.25% of the active sites on the beads) in PBS 
suspension (1:1 volume ratio; 25 ml) were then added and incubated with the 
respective lysates for 16 h at 4 °C on the rotator. In the flip experiment, the 
heavy and light lysates were swapped. Alternatively, in the inactive competi-
tor experiment, the light lysate was preincubated with TMP373, and the heavy 
lysate  was  preincubated  with  DMSO,  followed  by  incubation  with  TMP942 
beads separately. After incubation, the tubes were centrifuged (2,000g, 4 °C,  
5 min) to pellet the beads. The supernatant was aspirated, taking care to avoid 
disturbing the beads. The bead pellets were then washed with the lysis buffer 
containing additional 0.2% Igepal-CA630 once to remove excess TMP942 or 
TMP373. Beads from the heavy-light pair of tubes were then combined and 
washed three more times with the same buffer. Affinity enrichment with beads 
immobilized with TMP974 was processed similarly using free TMP974 and 
TMP373 as the active and inactive competitors, respectively.

Protein elution from beads and SDS/PAGE. After the final wash, beads were 
collected by centrifugation (2,000g, 4 °C, 5 min), and the wash buffer was aspi-
rated, leaving 20 mL in the tube. Proteins attached to the beads were dissoci-
ated by adding Invitrogen Reducing Reagent and LDS buffer and heating at 
70 °C for 10 min. Proteins were resolved on a 4–12% gradient 1.5-mm-thick 
ten-well NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris (with MOPS) gel with MOPS running buffer 
(Invitrogen), stained with Coomassie blue (Simply Blue, Invitrogen) for 1 h and 
destained with water for 1 h.

In-gel proteolytic digestion.  Each  gel  lane  was  excised  into  20  equal  slices, 
and  each  slice  was  further  diced  into  1-mm  cubes.  The  gel  pieces  were 
washed and destained in a solution of 50% CH3CN: 50% 25 mM ammonium  
bicarbonate  on  a  rotary  shaker.  After  washing  with  25  mM  ammonium  
bicarbonate,  protein  reduction  was  carried  out  by  adding  4  mM  DTT  and  
incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. After DTT was removed, proteins were alkylated 
by addition of 10 mM iodoacetamide followed by incubation at 25 °C in the 
dark. Following the reduction and alkylation steps, gel pieces were washed with 
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by washing with 50% CH3CN: 50% 
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and finally with 100% CH3CN for dehydration. 
Gel pieces were rehydrated in trypsin (Promega) solution prepared in 25 mM  
ammonium bicarbonate (60 μl of 10 ng/μl stock) and incubated at 37 °C over-
night. Peptides were extracted by addition of 2% CH3CN, 1% formic acid solu-
tion with sonication for 10 min before transfer to auto-sampler vials.

MS. Reverse-phase LC separations were carried out on a Waters Nano Acquity 
system using a Waters BEH130 C18 (1.7-mm particle, 75 mm ID × 200 mm) nano 
column in conjunction with a Water Symmetry C18 (5-mm particle, 180 mm  
ID × 20 mm) trapping column. Both the column and the trap were heated 
to 50 °C. Peptide injections (partial loop with needle overfill) were trapped 
for  3  min  at  15.00  mL/min  99%  H2O,  0.2%  formic  acid:  1%  CH3CN,  0.2% 

formic acid. An 80-min chromatographic separation of the trapped peptides 
was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Peptides were separated using 
a  three-step  linear  gradient  operating  from  12–38%  CH3CN  over  the  first  
50 min and 38–95% over the next 10 min and held at 95% for 10 min. Samples 
were introduced into the LTQ OrbiTrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass 
spectrometer using a James Scientific nanospray source with a New Objective 
PicoTip emitter (FS360-20-10-D).

The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. Full scan 
OrbiTrap MS spectra were acquired from m/z 400–2,000 Da at a resolution of 
30,000 using an automatic gain control (AGC) value of 100,000. The ten most 
intense ions were sequentially isolated and fragmented in the linear ion trap 
by using collisionally induced dissociation at an AGC value of 10,000.

Data files were processed using the MaxQuant (version 1.1.1.25) suite of 
applications to identify and quantify all SILAC pairs. The Quant application 
was run in SILAC Doublets mode using Lys6 and Arg10 as the heavy labels. 
Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleav-
ages, and only peptides with a minimum of six amino acids were considered. 
The first search, with a threshold value of 20 p.p.m., used the human.first.
search.fasta database. This was followed by the main search against the ipi.
HUMAN.v3.78.fasta database at a 7-p.p.m. tolerance and 0.5-Da CID (MS/MS) 
tolerance. Acetyl (protein N-term), carbamidomethyl (C) and oxidation (M) 
were used as variable modifications. Peptide and protein identifications were 
accepted up to a maximum false discovery rate of 1%. Quantification of SILAC 
pairs was performed by MaxQuant using standard settings.

Gene array experiments. All procedures were performed at Boston University 
Microarray Resource Facility as described in the GeneChip Whole Transcript 
(WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and 
Ambion WT Expression Kit Protocol (Life Technologies).

Briefly, the total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and the 
sample integrity was verified using RNA 6000 Nano Assay RNA chips run in 
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The total RNA (100–200 ng) 
was reverse transcribed using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Life Technologies). 
The obtained cDNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription using 
Ambion® WT Expression Kit (Life Technologies). The obtained antisense cRNA 
was purified using Nucleic Acid Binding Beads (Ambion WT Expression Kit, 
Life Technologies) and used as a template for reverse transcription to produce 
single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation. During this step, dUTP was 
incorporated. The DNA was then fragmented using uracil DNA glycosylase 
(UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) and labeled with 
DNA labeling reagent covalently linked to biotin using terminal deoxynucleo-
tidyl transferase (TdT, Whole Transcript Terminal Labeling and Controls kit, 
Affymetrix). IVT and cDNA fragmentation quality controls were carried out 
by running an mRNA Nano assay in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

The labeled fragmented DNA was hybridized to the Gene Arrays 1.0ST 
for  16–18  h  in  GeneChip  Hybridization  oven  640  at  45  °C  with  rotation  
(60 r.p.m.). The hybridized samples were washed and stained using Affymetrix 
fluidics station 450 as per manufacturer’s instruction (Hybridization, Washing 
and Staining kit, Affymetrix). Microarrays were immediately scanned using 
Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000 7G Plus (Affymetrix).
