Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinases 1, 2, 3

Abstract Purpose: Axitinib (AG-013736) is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinases 1to 3 that is in clinical development for the treatment of
solid tumors. We provide a comprehensive description of its in vitro characteristics and activities,
in vivo antiangiogenesis, and antitumor efficacy and translational pharmacology data.
Experimental Design: The potency, kinase selectivity, pharmacologic activity, and antitumor
efficacy of axitinib were assessed in various nonclinical models.
Results: Axitinib inhibits cellular autophosphorylation of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) with picomo-
lar IC50 values. Counterscreening across multiple kinase and protein panels shows it is selective
for VEGFRs. Axitinib blocks VEGF-mediated endothelial cell survival, tube formation, and down-
stream signaling through endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase. Following twice daily oral administration, axitinib produces consistent and dose-depen-
dent antitumor efficacy that is associated with blocking VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, vascular per-
meability, angiogenesis, and concomitant induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Axitinib in
combination with chemotherapeutic or targeted agents enhances antitumor efficacy in many tu-
mor models compared with single agent alone. Dose scheduling studies in a human pancreatic
tumor xenograft model show that simultaneous administration of axitinib and gemcitabine with-
out prolonged dose interruption or truncation of axitinib produces the greatest antitumor efficacy.
The efficacious drug concentrations predicted in nonclinical studies are consistent with the range
achieved in the clinic. Although axitinib inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors and KIT
with nanomolar in vitro potencies, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, axitinib
acts primarily as aVEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor at the current clinical exposure.
Conclusions: The selectivity, potency for VEGFRs, and robust nonclinical activity may afford
broad opportunities for axitinib to improve cancer therapy.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in
tumor angiogenesis by promoting vascular and lymphatic
endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and invasion, resulting
in neovascularization, tumor growth, and metastasis (1 – 4).
Many antiangiogenic agents including multi-RTK inhibitors
(RTKI) are either approved or are being tested in clinical trials.

Translational Relevance

Axitinib is a potent and selectiveVEGFR inhibitor currently
in phase II/III development. Clinical reports and narrowly
focused academic publictions have been published. There
is a need to describe the characteristics of axitinib based
on information of discovery and translational research.
Clinical Cancer Research is an ideal journal for this article
because its broad audience of medical oncologists, transla-
tional researchers, and basic research scientists can all ben-
efit from this comprehensive and integrated report. The
translational value fo the article includes the clinically rele-
vant target and efficacious concentrations; the nature of
axitinib’s selectivity in the context of the current clinical
dose; the molecular basis for clinical hypertension and
why it would be manageable; the potential impact of dose
scheduling, interruption, or truncation on antitumor effica-
cy; and for the first time the proof of concept of enhanced
benefit by targeting both the VEGF ligand and intracellular
VEGFR of tumor vasculature ^ a hypothesis that is being
tested in the clinic.We also briefly discuss the difference in
selectivity profile between several similar RTKIs, an issue
of interest in the field of antiangiogenesis. This discussion
provides clarification on why we believe axitinib would
present non-overlapping and important therapeutic oppor-
tunities in the clinic.

VEGFR selectivity are in phase II/III development with some
activities including PTK787 (12), AZD2171 (13), and motesa-
nib diphosphate (14). The phase II activities of multi-RTKIs
XL999 [ref. 15; anti-fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)
1-3, VEGFR-2, PDGFR, RET, KIT, SRC, and Flt-3] and XL880
(ref. 16; anti-MET and VEGFR) are encouraging but are coupled
with noticeable toxicities.

Although the multi-RTKIs can be highly effective in treating
cancers through antagonizing more than one cancer pathway,
an oral, potent, and selective VEGF RTKI with desirable
pharmacokinetics may improve effectiveness, ease of dose
adjustment, and high combinability with chemotherapy and
targeted therapy, which enables the treatment of a broad
spectrum of cancers. Furthermore,
the highly potent and
selective VEGF RTKIs may afford to avoid significant adverse
events in patients that do not tolerate the inhibition of multiple
RTKs (often expressed on epithelial cells, hematopoietic
lymphocytes, and/or leukocytes), as in the case of potent,
selective, and prolonged PDGFR inhibition that may not be
desirable (17, 18).

Axitinib is an oral, potent, and selective small-molecule
inhibitor of VEGF RTKs 1, 2, 3. It is currently in phase I to III
development in a range of solid tumors. In nonclinical and
clinical studies, the compound has been shown to inhibit
angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and blood flow (19 – 21).
In phase II studies, axitinib showed single-agent activity in a
wide range of
including advanced renal cell
carcinoma (22), thyroid cancer (23), non-small cell lung cancer
(24), and melanoma (25) as well as improved progression-free
survival and overall survival
in advanced and metastatic
pancreatic cancer when combined with gemcitabine (26). In

tumor types,

Nonclinical Characterization of VEGF RTKI Axitinib

addition, axitinib has a well-tolerated clinical safety profile and
a relatively shorter half-life (2-5 h). Compared with some other
similar antiangiogenic agents currently in development, axi-
tinib appears to be a much more potent and selective VEGFR
inhibitor (Fig. 1), which may be a key contributing factor to its
clinical activity and tolerability.

Materials and Methods

Compound synthesis and formulation
Axitinib (N-methyl-2-[3-(E)-2-pyridin-2-yl-vinyl-1H-indazol-6-ylsul-
fanyl]benzamide) was synthesized as described in U.S. Patent
6,534,524. For in vitro experiments, axitinib was dissolved in 10
mmol/L DMSO and diluted as needed, and for in vivo studies, axitinib

was formulated in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose/H2OHCl (g/v, pH

2-3) and dosed as a suspension at 5 mL/kg orally twice daily.
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Henry Shein) was formulated in sterile PBS
and dosed at 5 mg/kg i.v. twice a week. Docetaxel (Taxotere; Amersham/
Bergen Brunswick) was administered i.v. at 5 to 40 mg/kg once a week.
Carboplatin was dosed i.p. daily for 5 days during each treatment cycle.
Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly) was formulated in 0.9% NaCI and dosed i.p.
3 times per d for 4 d with a 10-day dosing break between cycles.

Cells and cell culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased
from Clonetics or Cambrex Bio Science. Human microvascular
endothelial cells were purchased from Cascade Biologics. MV522
(human colon cancer) cells were obtained from the University of
California. M24met (human melanoma) cells were provided by
Dr. Barbara Mueller (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine). Tumor
cell
lines LLC (murine Lewis lung carcinoma), NIH-3T3 (murine
fibroblastoma), C6 (rat glioblastoma), U87MG (human glioblastoma),
MDA-MB-231 (human breast carcinoma), HT29 (human colon
carcinoma), A375 and A2058 (human melanoma), NCI-H526 (human
small cell lung carcinoma), A2780 (human ovarian carcinoma), and
Namalwa (human lymphoma) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection.

Animals
Female nu/nu mice or severe combined immunodeficient beige mice
(ages 7-10 weeks) were obtained from Harlan or Charles River
Laboratories. Animals were fed Lab Diet 5061 (PMI Nutrition
International) and water ad libitum. Animal experiments were carried
out in observance with Pfizer Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines and in accordance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILARCLS, 1996) by Institute of
Laboratory Animal Research (NIH).

Cellular receptor kinase phosphorylation assay
Porcine aorta endothelial (PAE) cells overexpressing full-length
VEGFR-2, PDGFR-h, KIT, and NIH-3T3 overexpressing murine
VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) or PDGFR-a were generated as described previously
(27, 28). The ELISA capture plates were prepared by coating 96-well
ReactiBind plates (Pierce) with 100 AL/well of 2.5 Ag/mL anti-VEGFR-2
antibody (Novus Biologicals), 0.75 Ag/mL anti-PDGFR-h antibody,
0.25 Ag/mL anti-PDGFR-a antibody (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
0.5 Ag/mL anti-KIT antibody (NeoMarkers), or 1.20 Ag/mL anti-Flk-1
antibody (Invitrogen). Measurement of RTK phosphorylation by ELISA
was done as described previously (29).

Three-dimensional spheroidal tube formation assay
Five hundred human microvascular endothelial cells were added
to EGM-2 medium containing 0.24% methylcellulose and transferred
to U-bottomed 96-well plates to form a spheroid overnight. Approx-
imately 50 spheroids were collected and mixed with 2 mg/mL
fibrinogen solution containing 4% to 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS)

with or without compound in the 48-well plates coated with thrombin
(5,000 units/mL). The resulting three-dimensional
fibrin gel was
covered with EGM-2 containing 4% to 8% FBS and incubated at
37jC. Endothelial tube formation was observed daily under an inverted
microscope.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Endothelial or tumor cells were starved for 18 h in the presence
of either 1% FBS (HUVEC) or 0.1% FBS (tumor cells). Axitinib was
added and cells were incubated for 45 min at 37jC in the presence of
1 mmol/L Na3VO4. The appropriate growth factor was added to the
cells, and after 5 min, cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in the
lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Applied Science). The lysates were incubated with immunoprecipitation
antibodies for the intended proteins overnight at 4jC. Antibody
complexes were conjugated to protein A beads and supernatants were
separated by SDS-PAGE. The Super Signal West Dura kit (Pierce) was
used to detect the chemiluminescent signal.

In vivo target modulation
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation inhibition in the rat development model.
Six-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory) were given
two i.p. injections of axitinib. Animals were sacrificed, retinas were
collected and lysed, and immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experi-
ments were done as described above. ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) was used for detection and densitometry analysis was done
using the Alpha Imager 8800 (Alpha Innotech).

VEGFR-2 phosphorylation inhibition in xenograft tumors. Mice with
M24met xenograft tumors (400-600 mm3) were administered with a
single dose of axitinib or the control (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose/
H2O). Blood and tumor tissue samples were collected for pharmaco-
kinetic and VEGFR-2 measurements. Total protein concentrations in
tumor tissues were determined using the Bradford colorimetric assay
(Bio-Rad). Procedures for immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and
ELISA were as described above.

Axitinib pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of axitinib were quantitatively determined
by a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with a high-
performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent 1100) using a

Phenyl column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB, 5 Am particle size, 50  2.1 mm)

under isocratic conditions of 60:40 water/acetonitrile containing 0.1%
formic acid. Data were collected under multiple reaction monitoring
mode of m/z 387.3!356.2 for axitinib and m/z 394.2!360.2 for the
internal standard, AG-013736-d7. The method quantified for axitinib
over the range of 1 to 1,000 ng/mL in mouse plasma. The area under
the plasma concentration-time curve of axitinib was calculated using
the linear trapezoidal rule.

Skin vascular permeability assay in naive or tumor-bearing mice
The assay was done according to Miles and Miles (30) with some
modifications. nu/nu mice (n = 5-8) received a single oral dose of axitinib
followed by an injection of 30 AL Evan’s blue dye through the tail vein.
Thirty minutes later, murine VEGF-A (400 ng in 10 AL PBS) or PBS was
injected into the trunk area posterior to the shoulder of the animal. Four
hours later, the skin region immediately surrounding the blue color area
was dissected and immersed in 1 mL formamide. Evan’s blue was extracted
by incubating the tissues in formamide at 56jC for 24 h. Vascular
permeability was quantified by measuring light absorbance at 620 nm.

Mouse xenograft models
In general, tumor cells in FBS-depleted medium were implanted s.c.
into the right flank region of athymic mice, except for the following: the
M24met cells were implanted intradermally in a 50 to 100 AL volume in
BALB/C severe combined immunodeficient mice; the procedures for
orthotopic implantation of HCT-116-GFP and SN12C-GFP tumors have
been described elsewhere (31); the A375 cells were implanted in the
presence of 10% Matrigel; the LLC tumors were inoculated either using

the suspension cells or 2  2 mm viable tumor fragments via the Trocar

needles. Unless otherwise specified, mice were randomized when the
average tumor was f100 mm3 (9-12 per group). Tumor volumes

Fig. 2. Cellular potency and selectivity of axitinib. A, axitinib preferentially inhibits cellular phosphorylation of VEGFR-1,VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. The graph presents an
overlay of dose-response curves generated from ELISA (VEGFR-2, PDGFR-h, KIT, FGFR-1, and Flt-3) and immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting (VEGFR-1and VEGFR-3)
assays. After treatment with axitinib across the designated concentration range at 37jC for 1h, cells were stimulated for 5 to 10 min with 50 to 100 ng/mL VEGF-A for
VEGFR-1 (E) and VEGFR-2 (n), 100 ng/mL VEGF-C forVEGFR-3 (y), 20 to 50 ng/mL PDGF-BB for PDGFR-h (.), 80 ng/mL SCF for KIT (!), 50 ng/mL basic
FGF for FGFR-1 (5), or 100 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand for Flt-3 (o; all from R&D Systems). The rest of the procedures are described in Materials and Methods. The IC50 values
were calculated by fitting the data using a four-variable analysis in a statistical data-analyzing template. B, dose-dependent inhibition of VEGF-stimulated but not basic
FGF-stimulated HUVEC survival. HUVECs (passages 4-5) were incubated with axitinib for 45 min before adding 20 ng/mL VEGF (n) or basic FGF (E). Three days later,
viable cell numbers were determined by the method of MTT. Mean F SD of triplicates. IC50 values were calculated the same as above. C, axitinib (3, 6, 12.5, 25, and
50 nmol/L) dose-dependently blocked the sprouting and tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cell spheroids. Images were captured on day 7 by a
digital camera (Olympus BX60) connected to the microscope. D, dose-dependent inhibition of Akt, eNOS, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by axitinib in HUVEC by
immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting. HUVECs were starved and treated with axitinib for 45 min with the indicated concentrations followed by a 5-minVEGF stimulation.The
cell lysates (1mg total lysate proteins) were immunoprecipitated with antibody SC-1158 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) forVEGFR-2. For immunoblotting, anti-phosphotyrosine
antibody 4G10, phospho-Akt, phospho-eNOS, and phospho-MAPK44/42 (all Cell Signaling) were used for phosphorylated VEGFR-2, Akt, eNOS, and ERK1/2,
respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG was used as the secondary antibody to probe for phosphorylated proteins. Total VEGFR-2, Akt, eNOS, and ERK were
also probed using antibodies specific to these molecules. The levels of cellular proteins were not changed as a result of axitinib treatment (data not shown). Equal protein
loading of each lane is indicated by total ERK1/2 signal (bottom row).

were measured three times per week by electronic calipers and

calculated according to the following equation: 0.5  [length 
(width)2]. Treatment usually lasted for 2 to 4 weeks or until tumors
reached 1,500 mm3. The procedure for tumor bioluminescent imaging
and quantification using the IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen) has been
reported elsewhere (32).

Immunohistology studies
CD31 immunohistochemistry fluorescent staining. Frozen slides of
tumors were fixed in acetone for 10 min, air dried, washed in PBS, and
blocked in 5% rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories)/PBS for 30 min at
room temperature. The samples were exposed to rat anti-mouse CD31
(clone 13.3; BD Bioscience) at 1:150 dilution in 5% rabbit serum/PBS for
1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed in PBS three times, and
fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit
anti-goat (Invitrogen), were diluted 1:100 in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and
incubated on the slides for 20 min at room temperature. Tumor samples
were washed again in PBS three times before being mounted in
Vectashield (Hard Set mounting medium with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole; Vector Labs). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M, a
20 optical objective lens, and an Axiocam HR color digital camera.

Caspase-3 and Ki-67 staining. The tumor samples (4-5 per group)
were formalin-fixed, processed in Tissue Tek Vacuum Infiltration
Processor (Sakuka, Finetek USA), and embedded in paraffin wax
(Surgipath Medical Industries). Sections (5 Am) were cut and baked on

to microscope slides. All staining was run on a Discovery XT autostainer
and visualized with DAB Map Kit (both from Ventana Medical
Systems). Stained sections were imaged using a BX60 Olympus
microscope and a Microfire Digital Camera (Olympus).

Results

Axitinib potently inhibits cellular VEGF RTK activities in vitro.
In transfected or endogenous RTK-expressing cells, axitinib
potently blocked growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 with average IC50 values of 0.2 and 0.1
to 0.3 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Cellular activity
against VEGFR-1 was 1.2 nmol/L (measured in the presence of
2.3% bovine serum albumin), equivalent to an absolute IC50 of
f0.1 nmol/L, based on protein binding of axitinib. The potency
against murine VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) in Flk-1-transfected NIH-3T3
cells was 0.18 nmol/L, similar to that of its human homologue.
Axitinib showed f8- to 25-fold higher IC50 against the closely
related type III and V family RTKs, including PDGFR-h (1.6
nmol/L), KIT (1.7 nmol/L), and PDGFR-a (5 nmol/L; Table 1);
nanomolar concentrations of axitinib blocked PDGF BB-
mediated human glioma U87MG cell (PDGFR-h-positive)
migration but not proliferation (data not shown). In contrast,

axitinib had much weaker target and functional activity against
FGFR-1 (Fig. 1A and B; Table 1). With up to 1 Amol/L
concentrations, axitinib showed minimal activity against Flt-3
in RS;411 cells and RET in TT cells (data not shown). A similar
trend was observed for enzymatic inhibitory activity (K i) against
recombinant tyrosine kinases of the aforementioned receptors
(data not shown). Importantly, axitinib had little inhibition
against ‘‘off-target’’ protein kinases; at a concentration of 1
Amol/L (f1,000-fold of the K i for VEGFR-2) across three kinase
panels of f100 protein kinases (Pfizer in-house; Upstate and
Dundee panels), axitinib inhibited only five protein kinases:
Abl, Aurora-2, Arg, AMPK, Axl, and MST2 (z60% inhibition).
Finally, axitinib exhibited no significant activity in a broad
protein kinase screen (Cerep; data not shown).

Axitinib inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell survival,
migration, and tube formation. Axitinib showed potent inhi-
bition of VEGF-stimulated but not basic FGF-stimulated
HUVEC survival with f1,000-fold selectivity for VEGFR-2
versus FGFR-1 receptors (Fig. 2B). The average IC50 value
for VEGFR-2 derived from the functional assays (0.24 F
0.09 nmol/L) was similar to that obtained in the cellular
receptor phosphorylation assays (Table 1), confirming that
receptor antagonism led to a functional
inhibition by the
compound. In addition, axitinib dose-dependently inhibited
spheroidal endothelial tube formation in a three-dimensional
fibrin matrix system (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1). Higher
compound concentrations than other types of assays were
required to inhibit tube formation because of the presence of
the higher serum level (4-8% FBS) in the system.

Axitinib inhibits intracellular signal transduction in endothe-
lial cells. Axitinib rapidly and dose-dependently reduced the
phosphorylation of Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2), key downstream signaling molecules of VEGF
(Fig. 2D), with IC50 values similar to that of the inhibition
of VEGFR-2. This suggests that the reduction in Akt, eNOS,
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation may be due to antagonism of
upstream VEGFRs by axitinib.

Target modulation in vivo by axitinib. Acute axitinib
treatment rapidly and significantly reduced retinal vascular
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. One hour after the second dose,

retinal VEGFR-2 phosphorylation was reduced by 80% to 90%
compared with that of the control tissues (Fig. 3A, left). Six and
24 to 32 h post-dose, the phospho-VEGFR-2 levels returned to
f50% and 100% of
the control, respectively. Levels of
phospho-VEGFR-2 inversely correlated with axitinib plasma
concentrations over the study time course. The EC50 value for
the inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation was 0.49 nmol/L
(or 0.19 ng/mL,
the unbound value corrected for plasma
protein binding; Fig. 3A, right).

Axitinib also inhibited murine VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in
angiogenic vessels of xenograft tumors of the M24met; M24met
tumors secrete high VEGF-A, are highly vascularized, and do
not express functional human VEGFR-2. A single oral dose of
axitinib (100 mg/kg) markedly suppressed murine VEGFR-2
phosphorylation for up to 7 h compared with control tumors
(Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of downstream ERK1/2 was also
measured from the same samples. Compared with the control,
partial inhibition of ERK1/2 signal was observed in treated
tissues as early as 30 min post-dose and remained inhibited for
at least 7 h (Fig. 3C).

Axitinib rapidly inhibited VEGF-induced vascular permea-
bility in the skin of mice; the inhibition was dose-dependent
and directly correlated with drug concentration in mice
(Fig. 3D). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis indi-
cated an unbound EC50 of 0.46 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Similar inhibitory effects were also shown in the skin
of MV522 tumor-bearing mice without exogenous VEGF-A
stimulation (data not shown).

Taken together, the required in vivo pharmacologic con-
centration (C target) based on the inhibition of vascular
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and VEGF-mediated permeability
is f0.5 nmol/L (unbound), which translates to a C target of
f100 nmol/L (or 40 ng/mL, total concentration) in humans.

growth inhibition in the MV522 tumor model is shown (Fig.
4A). Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was associated with
central necrosis, reduction in microvessel density (CD31
staining) and Ki-67, and increased caspase-3 in the tumor
(Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar effects were observed
in all tumor types examined regardless of tumor type and RTK

expression. In summary, axitinib treatment produced consistent
antitumor efficacy across various tumor types and this activity is
associated with reduction in vascular angiogenesis and tumor
proliferation and increase in tumor apoptosis.

Fig. 3. Axitinib showed in vivo target modulation and antiangiogenesis. A, in vivo modulation of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in the rat ocular angiogenesis model. Six-week-
old rats were given two injections of axitinib (30 mg/kg i.p.). Animals were sacrificed at 0, 1, 6, 24, 32, and 48 h post-dose and six retinas from three animals were pooled and
lysed. Soluble retinal protein (1mg) was immunoprecipitated with VEGFR-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Left, phospho-VEGFR-2
and total VEGFR-2 were probed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and VEGFR-2 antibody (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Right, relative VEGFR-2
phosphorylation signals were normalized to total VEGFR-2 intensities in the corresponding lanes and plotted against plasma concentrations at the time points of tissue
collection; a nonlinear regression curve fit of the plot revealed the target inhibition concentration of 0.49 nmol/L (unbound; 0.19 ng/mL). For curve fit purpose, the 48 h
plasma concentration is assumed to be 0.05 nmol/L (unbound), which is right below the detection limit. B, in vivo modulation of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in the
vasculature of M24met xenograft tumors in mice. M24met cells (2  106) were implanted into the lower flank region of severe combined immunodeficient (BALB/c) mice
intradermally. A single dose of axitinib (50 mg/kg orally) was given when tumors reached 500 to 800 mm3. Animals were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 4, and 7 h post-dose (n = 4-5
per group) and blood samples were collected for plasma concentration. Tumor samples were harvested and lysates (1-2 mg total tumor or HUVEC proteins) were added
with 4 to 10 Ag antibody toVEGFR-2 (SC-1158) for immunoprecipitation. The remaining procedure is the same as described previously. Shown are phosphorylation signals
for all individual samples from treatment time point, the control group, and HUVECs. Average plasma concentration values are also indicated. C, in vivo inhibition of
ERK1/2 in M24met tumors. Change of ERK1/2 activity of the M24met tumors in response to axitinib treatment were measured in tumor lysates. Total lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phospho-MAPK44/42 or anti-MAPK44/42 (Cell Signaling). The remaining procedure is the same as described previously in
Materials and Methods. Each lane is a representative tumor under each time point of tissue collection and the corresponding plasma concentration values are indicated.
D, axitinib treatment reduced skin vascular permeability, which inversely correlated to plasma drug concentrations.Vascular permeability values of VEGF-stimulated
and axitinib-treated groups (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) were measured as described in Materials and Methods. Group vascular permeability was normalized to that of
the control group (Yaxis, left) and plotted against dose levels. The corresponding plasma concentration values at 4 h post-dose are also plotted against dose levels
[shown as group mean F SD] (Yaxis, right).

using the MV522 model. MV522 tumor cells do not express
functional VEGF or PDGF RTKs. In addition, the tumors have a
moderate growth rate, making it an ideal model to evaluate the
antiangiogenesis-associated ED50 of axitinib. Based on the
relationship between dose and the corresponding TGI (Fig. 4A),
the ED50 was determined to be 8.8 mg/kg twice daily
(Supplementary Fig. S4) and a 30 mg/kg twice daily dose level
corresponded to an ED70 in this model. The range of in vivo
efficacious concentration (C eff) corresponding to a 50% TGI
was determined by evaluating the relationship between TGI

(Fig. 4A) and plasma concentrations. Based on C min (trough
concentration), the estimated unbound C eff was determined to
be 0.28 nmol/L (or 0.11 ng/mL; Fig. 4C, left); based on C ave
(average concentration across 24 h), the calculated unbound
C eff was determined to be 0.85 nmol/L (0.33 ng/mL; Fig. 4C,
right). Thus, the C eff value range (0.28-0.85 nmol/L) is in
agreement with the C target value (0.5 nmol/L) obtained from
in vivo target modulation studies.

The relationship between dose and target inhibition was
further analyzed based on pharmacokinetic profiles, IC50 values,

C target, and C eff. Plasma concentrations at 10 mg/kg (ED50 dose)
and 30 mg/kg (ED70 dose) were both above and near C target
(for VEGFRs) and C eff (TGI-based) during the majority of the
day (Fig. 4D). However, the plasma concentrations at these
doses only allowed a total of f5 and 12 h coverage over the
cellular IC50 of PDGFR-h, respectively (anti-PDGFR-based C target
or C eff from in vivo studies is not available). Based on this
analysis, the antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg in the MV522 model
(VEGFR-null, PDGFR-null) appeared to be mainly driven from

vascular VEGFR inhibition by axitinib. In the same model,
infusions of axitinib achieved a near maximal antitumor efficacy
(80%) that was associated with a steady-state plasma concentra-
tion greater than the cellular IC50 for VEGFRs but below the
cellular IC50 for PDGFR-h (data not shown).

Axitinib enhances antitumor efficacy of chemotherapeutic
agents in multiple tumor models. The antitumor efficacy of
axitinib was assessed in combination with docetaxel (in LLC
and human breast cancer models), carboplatin (in a human

Antibody 9661L (Cell Signaling) and RM9106 (Lab Vision/NeoMarkers) were used as the primary antibodies for caspase-3 and Ki-67, respectively. All images were taken
at 20 magnification. C, derivation of EC50 of axitinib from the MV522 TGI study. The %TGI F SE was plotted against either Cmin (left) or C ave (right) plasma concentrations
corresponding to the different dose levels to derive EC50. Curve fit and calculation of EC50 values using the sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression model (Prism,
GraphPad) are shown. To facilitate the curve fit, a close to 0% TGI was assigned to an artificial plasma concentration of 1/100 of the lowest measurable value. The curve fit
was nonrestrictional at the high concentration end (a 100% TGI was not enforced for curve fit). D, axitinib preferentially inhibited VEGFRs at the ED50 and ED70 doses.
The pharmacokinetic profile is created by plotting the plasma concentrations (F SE) against the time points of treatment at 10 mg/kg twice daily (E) and 30 mg/kg twice
daily (n). The pharmacokinetic profile was analyzed against the derived C target (0.5 nmol/L) and C eff (0.28-0.85 nmol/L) of axitinib. IC50 values forVEGFR-2 (0.2 nmol/L)
and PDGFR-h (1.6 nmol/L) are also shown. The duration of action against VEGFRs and PDGFR-h is assessed base on this correlative analysis.

Fig. 5. Effect of axitinib in combination with chemotherapeutics and bevacizumab. A, axitinib significantly enhanced animal survival as single agent and in combination
with docetaxel in the LLC model. LLC cells were inoculated into B6D2F1mice (1 106 per site, s.c.). Mice were randomly assigned to treatment with axitinib alone,
docetaxel alone (40 mg/kg; !), or axitinib plus docetaxel combination treatment. The Kaplan-Meier plot shows delay of TTE; DTTE (TTEtreat - TTEcontrol) was found to
be 1.9 d for docetaxel alone (P > 0.05, versus vehicle control; n), 1.5 d (P > 0.05, versus control), 6.4 d (P < 0.001, versus control), and 13.9 d (P < 0.001, versus control)
for axitinib at 3 mg/kg (E), 10 mg/kg (y), and 30 mg/kg (.), respectively. DTTE was 2.5 d (P = 0.05, versus axitinib; P = 0.6, versus docetaxel), 11.6 d (P = 0.047,
versus axitinib; P < 0.001, versus docetaxel), and 21.9 d (P = 0.043, versus axitinib; P < 0.001, versus docetaxel) for the combination treatment groups involving

model BxPC-3. Xenografts were initiated by s.c. implanting a f1mm3 BxPC-3 tumor fragment in the right flank of each mouse. Treatments began when tumors were
f90 mm3 in size. Axitinib was dosed at 30 mg/kg orally twice daily for 60 d (60 d) except for the last two groups; gemcitabine (Gem) was given at 140 mg/kg i.p. 3 times
per day for 4 d for either one cycle (1C) or three cycles (3C). Tumors were measured twice weekly and animals were euthanized when their tumors reached an endpoint
volume of 1,200 mm3 or on 60 d of treatment, whichever came first. Data shown are tumor sizes at 53 d of treatment. The control and gemcitabine single groups are not
included because all tumors in these groups reached the 1,200 mm3 end point before day 53. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA with aTukey’s multiple
comparison test. C, combination therapy of axitinib and bevacizumab significantly inhibited spontaneous lymph node metastasis and prolonged survival of animals in the
M24met model. Primary tumors were surgically removed once they reached the size of 200 to 300 mm3, which enhanced tumor metastasis to lymph nodes and the lung.
Lymph node tumors were measured until the predetermined survival end point (total lymph node tumor size = 2,000 mm3). Treatment with axitinib (60 mg/kg orally twice

In the LLC model, axitinib (10 or 30 mg/kg orally twice
daily) in combination with a maximally tolerated dose of
docetaxel (40 mg/kg once a week) enhanced tumor growth

burden or metastasis. A 54% or 100% tumor growth delay was
obtained for docetaxel plus 10 or 30 mg/kg axitinib versus a

axitinib significantly delayed disease progression compared
with docetaxel alone (Fig. 5A). In the MDA-MB-435/HAL-luc

model, axitinib (30 mg/kg) and docetaxel (5 mg/kg; 25% of
murine maximally tolerated dose) produced a robust tumor
growth delay as shown by the reduction of tumor biolumines-
cent signal (Supplementary Fig. S5) and increase in the number
of complete responders compared with either single agent
alone (data not shown).

The antitumor efficacy of axitinib in combination with
gemcitabine was investigated against various dosing schedules
in the gemcitabine-resistant BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer
model (Fig. 5B).
In one study, single-agent gemcitabine
(140 mg/kg i.p., days 1, 4, 7, and 10, either one-cycle or
three-cycle treatments) or axitinib (30 mg/kg orally twice daily)
delayed tumor growth. In the groups receiving gemcitabine plus
axitinib,
the ‘‘early dosing’’ of axitinib (day 1, group 5)
produced a greater tumor growth delay than ‘‘late dosing’’
[starting axitinib on day 11 (group 6) or 16 (group 7) after

initiation of gemcitabine]
gemcitabine cycles; with the same axitinib regimen,
three
gemcitabine treatment cycles (group 8, 9, 10) produced a
greater efficacy than one gemcitabine treatment cycle (group 5,
6, 7). Alternating dose of the two agents (group 12) or early
termination of axitinib (group 11) resulted in a significant
compromise in tumor growth delay compared with coadmin-
istration and continuous twice daily dosing of axitinib.

Combination of axitinib and bevacizumab produced significant
antimetastasis activity in M24met model. The ability of axitinib
to enhance bevacizumab efficacy in the orthotopically implanted
and spontaneous metastasis human melanoma M24met tumor
model was investigated; M24met
tumors do not express
functional RTKs (data not shown). Most importantly, circulating
human VEGF-A, the ligand for bevacizumab, was found to be
>95% of total circulating VEGF-A in vivo in this model.

In this study, both axitinib (60 mg/kg orally twice daily) and
bevacizumab (5 mg/kg i.v., 2xqw) exhibited moderate single-
agent activity against
lymph node tumor metastasis. The
combination of the two agents significantly improved anti-
metastasis efficacy assessed based on reduction of lymph node
tumor mass (Fig. 5C), antiangiogenesis (Supplementary Fig.
S6), and proliferation index of metastatic lymph node tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S7). In addition, the combination therapy
significantly prolonged animal survival measured by reduction
of time to progression (TTE), with a 13-day TTE for both single
agents versus the control and a 20-day TTE for combination
therapy versus the control (Fig. 5D). As expected, dosing with
bevacizumab or bevacizumab plus axitinib, but not axitinib
single-agent
treatment, significantly reduced free plasma
human VEGF-A (data not shown).

Discussion

Axitinib was generated from an iterative structure-based
drug design approach and is a potent (picomolar) and selective
inhibitor of VEGF RTKs 1, 2, 3. The compound exhibits f8-
fold lower inhibitory activity against PDGFRs and KIT and
has little activity against other type III and V family kinases
(CSF-1R, Flt-3, FGFR-1, and RET), epidermal growth factor
receptor, and c-Met. Axitinib is highly selective against
nonreceptor kinases and proteins in a variety of off-target
screening assays.

Axitinib dose-dependently inhibits endothelial cell prolifer-
ation, survival, and three-dimensional tube formation in vitro.

Nonclinical Characterization of VEGF RTKI Axitinib

Axitinib rapidly blocks downstream signal transduction via the
eNOS/Akt pathway that has been implicated in the pathologic
angiogenesis and normal vascular homeostasis (33, 34). The
required concentrations for eNOS and Akt phosphorylation
inhibition track with that
for VEGFR-2 phosphorylation
inhibition by axitinib. Furthermore, phospho-eNOS inhibition
was reversible with the signal fully recovered soon after (1-2 h)
withdrawal of axitinib (whereas inhibition of phospho-VEGFR-
2 was sustained for up to 8 h; data not shown). Consistent with
these findings is the observation that, in the clinic, axitinib-
associated increases in diastolic blood pressure are reversible
and closely correlate with clinical outcome (35).

In vivo, axitinib markedly inhibited vascular VEGFR-2
phosphorylation in (a) the development rat ocular angiogen-
esis model, (b) the VEGF-mediated skin permeability model of
mice, and (c) the vasculature of a human xenograft tumor
model in mice. In addition, the C target values derived from the
rat ocular angiogenesis model and the mouse permeability
model (f0.5 nmol/L) are consistent with the efficacy-based
C eff value (0.28-0.85 nmol/L) obtained from TGI studies.
Furthermore, the C eff value derived from these nonclinical
studies in general agrees with the range of plasma concen-
trations of the 5 mg twice daily clinical starting dose of axitinib
(C ave = 0.19 F 0.12 nmol/L; interim data). This clinical dose
is associated with reduced tumor permeability and blood
flow (19), tumor shrinkage (RECIST), overall response rate,
and survival benefit observed in multiple phase II axitinib
single-agent and combination studies in the clinic (22 – 25).

Axitinib alone produced marked antitumor efficacy that was
associated with antiangiogenesis effects across nonclinical
models regardless of the RTK expression profile in the tumor
cells. This may imply that axitinib may have broad indications
and utility in the clinic. In addition, based on published
information and this report, we believe that vascular VEGFR
inhibition alone by axitinib is essential and sufficient
to
produce significant antiangiogenesis and meaningful antitumor
activity. In animal models, this activity can be achieved with a
10 to 15 mg/kg orally twice daily administration of axitinib.
Higher dose levels of axitinib (>30 mg/kg) in mice have been
shown to produce a C max exposure significantly above the IC50
for PDGFR and typically were associated with greater antitumor
efficacy (see Fig. 4A); we believe that although a transient
PDGFR inhibition may have partially contributed to the
efficacy, a more sustained and prolonged inhibition of
VEGFR-2 throughout
the day played a
significant role in efficacy enhancement. The latter is consistent
with the preliminary nonclinical data that equal or even
greater efficacy can be achieved through continuous infusion
of axitinib with a steady-state plasma concentration lower
than PDGFR IC50. Furthermore, in the RIP-Tag2 transgenic
tumor model
in which axitinib at efficacious dose levels
(up to 25 mg/kg) produced rapid and dramatic inhibition of
tumor endothelial cell fenestration, VEGFR-2 expression, vessel
growth, and vascular density but did not decrease PDGFR
expression or tumor vasculature-associated pericytes,
there
was, however, evidence that certain markers on the pericytes
were modulated (36, 37). The interpretation of
the latter
remains to be addressed. Based on our nonclinical and clinical
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic understanding, C max of
the current clinical starting dose of axitinib (5 mg twice daily)
in general does not exceed the IC50 for PDGFR in the majority

of patients; this suggests that the observed clinical activity of
axitinib in most patients is driven by inhibition of VEGFR
activity.

Combining axitinib with docetaxel generated marked sup-
pression of disease progression compared with docetaxel alone
in a docetaxel-resistant LLC model. In addition, additive or
synergistic enhancement of TGI and response to chemothera-
peutic agents alone was observed when axitinib was combined
with docetaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine. With gemcita-
bine, dose scheduling was an important contributing factor to
efficacy. This may indicate that simultaneous administration of
both compounds without prolonged dose interruptions or
withdrawal as of axitinib is likely to produce the optimal
clinical outcome. More studies are under way to gain a deeper
insight into how axitinib and chemotherapeutic agents can be
best used for maximal activity in animal models.

Dose-escalation studies showed that axitinib single agent had a
therapeutic index of 64 in the murine LLC model (data not
shown). In general, chronic treatments (3-6 weeks) of axitinib up
to 100 mg/kg in combination with maximally tolerated dose levels
of chemotherapeutic agents were tolerated in tumor-bearing mice,
consistent with the highly selective nature of axitinib. In addition,
the nonclinical safety profile was extensively evaluated in safety
pharmacology, genetic toxicology, and general toxicology assess-
ments and the monitorable and manageable toxicity profile
supported the clinical evaluation of axitinib.

In the clinic, bevacizumab (anti-VEGF-A) has shown activity
in combination with chemotherapeutics (9, 10). Currently,
several clinical studies are being conducted combining bevaci-
zumab with small-molecule RTKIs to determine whether clinical
activity may be improved. Here, we present data from a
nonclinical model to address this hypothesis. In a spontaneous
metastatic human melanoma model, we observed that coad-
ministration of axitinib and bevacizumab significantly improved
antimetastasis efficacy compared with either agent alone. Lymph
node metastasis of M24met may be highly dependent on
lymphangiogenesis, in which VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 plays a central
role (38 – 41). In addition to VEGF-A, other ligands including
VEGF-D (42), VEGF-E (43, 44), and PlGF (45 – 47) are found to
contribute to tumor angiogenesis and progression by binding to
VEGFR-3, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, or neuropilin (48). Furthermore,
these growth factors interact with each other synergistically
to promote processes leading to sustained tumor progression
(45, 46). In this context, small-molecule VEGF RTKIs may have

advantage over VEGF-A-selective bevacizumab. Finally, a recent
report showed that intracellular autonomous VEGF/VEGFR-2
signaling had an indispensable role in vascular homeostasis and
endothelial cell survival (49) and that intracellular VEGFR-2
activation in wild-type cells was suppressed by a small-molecule
VEGFR antagonist but not by bevacizumab. The implication of
intracellular VEGFR-2 inhibition in the context of
tumor
angiogenesis remains to be elucidated; however, it is conceivable
that membrane permeable axitinib, but not bevacizumab, may
potently inhibit intracellular VEGFR-2 signaling (in addition to
inhibiting VEGFR autophosphorylation mediated by exogenous
VEGF) in tumor endothelial cells that ultimately induce
endothelial cell apoptosis that cannot be rescued by exogenous
VEGF. Although clinically combining axitinib and bevacizumab
may not be feasible due to overlapping mechanism-based
adverse events such as hypertension, we believe that,
in
principle, combining intracellular and extracellular inhibition
of VEGF signaling would lead to robust and prolonged
antiangiogenesis.

In summary, axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 with proven antitumor
activity from nonclinical and clinical studies. Axitinib may
evolve to become one of
the most promising oral VEGF
RTKIs with significant single-agent antitumor activity and
combinability for the treatment of a broad spectrum of
human malignancies.
