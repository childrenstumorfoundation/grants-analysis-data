There is now considerable experimental evidence that aber-
rant activation of Rho family small GTPases promotes the
uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, and metastatic properties
of human cancer cells. Therefore, there is considerable interest
in the development of small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase
function. However, to date, most efforts have focused on inhib-
itors that indirectly block Rho GTPase function, by targeting
either enzymes involved in post-translational processing or
downstream protein kinase effectors. We recently determined
that the EHT 1864 small molecule can inhibit Rac function in
vivo. In this study, we evaluated the biological and biochemical
specificities and biochemical mechanism of action of EHT 1864.
We determined that EHT 1864 specifically inhibited Rac1-de-
pendent platelet-derived growth factor-induced lamellipodia
formation. Furthermore, our biochemical analyses with recom-
binant Rac proteins found that EHT 1864 possesses high affinity
binding to Rac1, as well as the related Rac1b, Rac2, and Rac3
isoforms,andthisassociationpromotedthelossofboundnucle-
otide,inhibitingbothguaninenucleotideassociationandTiam1
Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor-stimulated exchange
factor activity in vitro. EHT 1864 therefore places Rac in an inert
and inactive state, preventing its engagement with downstream
effectors. Finally, we evaluated the ability of EHT 1864 to block
Rac-dependent growth transformation, and we determined that
EHT 1864 potently blocked transformation caused by constitu-
tively activated Rac1, as well as Rac-dependent transformation
caused by Tiam1 or Ras. Taken together, our results suggest that
EHT 1864 selectively inhibits Rac downstream signaling and
transformation by a novel mechanism involving guanine nucle-
otide displacement.

Rho family proteins (20 human members) comprise a major
branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (1, 2). Like Ras,
Rho GTPases function as GDP/GTP-regulated binary on-off
switches. In resting, quiescent cells, Rho GTPases exist pre-

dominately in their inactive, GDP-bound state. Upon growth
factor stimulation, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (RhoGEFs)4 are activated, and they stimulate the intrin-
sic guanine nucleotide exchange activity to promote formation
of the active GTP-bound protein. Rho-GTP binds preferen-
tially to downstream effector proteins. Rho-specific GTPase-
activating proteins then stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis
activity of Rho GTPases, returning the protein to its inactive
state and terminating effector interaction.

RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the best studied and understood
members of the Rho GTPase family (1, 2). Rho GTPases are
regulators of a diverse variety of cellular processes that include
regulation of cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton reorganiza-
tion, and gene expression (3). Like Ras and other members of
the Ras superfamily (4, 5), the aberrant activity of Rho GTPases
has been implicated in cancer and other human diseases
(6–10). In particular, the Rac subfamily has also been linked to
cellular transformation. Rac is essential for transformation
caused by Ras and other oncogenes (11–16). The Rac1b splice
variant of Rac1 is constitutively active and transforming and
found overexpressed in breast and colon cancers (17–19).
Mutation and overexpression of Rac3 was seen in human brain
tumors, and RNA interference demonstrated a role for Rac1
and Rac3 in human glioblastoma invasion (20, 21). Finally, the
Vav RacGEF is found hyperactivated in pancreatic cancers, and
suppression of Vav1 expression impairs pancreatic tumor cell
growth (22).

Due to their central nature in many transforming events, Rho
GTPases are therefore attractive and validated targets for anti-
cancer therapies. One approach has involved small molecule
inhibitors of the prenyltransferases (23, 24). Farnesyltrans-
ferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I catalyze the covalent
modification of Rho GTPases by isoprenoid lipids, which then
promote the membrane association required for Rho GTPase
interaction with effectors and biological activity. However,
because these prenyltransferases are involved in the modifica-
tion of a multitude of other proteins important in cell prolifer-

ation and survival (25), inhibitors of prenyltransferases are
likely to possess significant off-target activities and may lack
sufficient specificity to selectively block Rho GTPase function.
Another approach has involved inhibitors of the protein kinase
effectors of Rho GTPases, for example, the Y-27632 small mol-
ecule inhibitor of the Rho-associated serine/threonine protein
kinase (ROCK), a key effector of RhoA. However, because Rho
GTPasesutilizeamultitudeofotherdownstreameffectors,ROCK
inhibitors will impair only a subset of RhoA functions (26).

Inhibitors that directly interact with Rho GTPases would be
preferable and exhibit greater specificity. However, to date,
there has been limited success in the identification of inhibitors
that specifically interact with small GTPases. One example is
the NSC23766 small molecule, which was identified as a cell-
permeable compound that can bind directly to Rac1 and pre-
vent its activation by Rac-specific RhoGEFs (27). However, this
inhibitor did not block Rac activation by some GEFs (Vav1),
and Rac activation by other mechanisms will also be insensitive
to NSC23766. Recently, we identified EHT 1864 as a small mol-
ecule that inhibited Rac-dependent amyloid precursor protein
processing by ␥-secretase and decreased A␤production in vitro
and in vivo (28). Our preliminary characterization found that
EHT 1864 inhibited a variety of downstream signaling activities
activated by ectopic expression of constitutively-activated
Rac1(G12V) and decreased Rac1 association with the isolated
Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) of the p21-activated ser-
ine/threonine kinase effector PAK1 in vivo. However, the Rho
GTPase specificity and mechanism of action of EHT 1864 was
not determined. We report here on the further investigation of
EHT 1864. We show that EHT 1864 selectively blocks platelet
growth factor-stimulated activation of Rac1-dependent lamel-
lipodia formation and not ligand activation of RhoA- or Cdc42-
mediated actin reorganization. Our biochemical analyses
determined that EHT 1864 also interacts with other Rac iso-
forms, associates with Rac1 tightly, and causes the release of
bound nucleotide, thus preventing effector interaction, both in
vitro and in vivo. Finally, we determined that EHT 1864
potently inhibited other Rac-dependent transformation pro-
cesses, Tiam1- and Ras-mediated growth transformation. Our
work suggests that EHT 1864 may form the basis for a novel
class of specific GTPase inhibitors that function by impairing
downstream effector engagement and activation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Rho-GTP Formation Pulldown Analyses—For analysis of the
effect of EHT 1864 on the formation of the GTP-bound form of
RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vivo, pulldown analyses were done as
we have described previously (28). Briefly, U87-MG cells were
grown to 80% confluence. The cells were then treated with EHT
1864 or with vehicle, lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton
X-100, and clarified, and the protein concentrations were normal-
ized.TheGTP-boundRhoGTPaselevelsinthelysatesweremeas-
ured using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein con-
taining the isolated RBD derived from the Rac and Cdc42 effector,
the PAK1 serine/threonine kinase (GST-PAK-RBD, Cytoskeleton
Inc., Denver, CO) for Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP detection, or the
RhoA effector, Rhotekin (GST-Rhotekin-RBD, provided by A.
Hall, University College, London, UK). Antibodies specific for

EHT 1864, a Novel Rac-specific Inhibitor

Rac1,Cdc42,andRhoA(Tebu,LePerrayenYvelines,France)were
then used for immunoblot analyses for GTP-bound Rho GTPase
and for total cell lysate protein levels.

Actin Reorganization Analyses—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% calf serum (designated complete growth medium). For
analysis of the effect of EHT 1864 treatment on extracellular
signal-induced changes in actin organization, we treated NIH
3T3 cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), lyso-
phosphatidic acid (LPA), or bradykinin (Sigma-Aldrich), to
activate endogenous Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42, respectively. NIH
3T3 cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 2 ⫻ 104
cells per well in 12-well plates. 24 h after cell seeding, cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 0.5% calf serum for 16 h in the presence
or absence of 5 ␮M EHT 1864 or EHT 8560 for the last 4 h.
Cells were stimulated for 15 min with 5 ng/ml PDGF, 40 ng/ml
LPA, or 100 ng/ml bradykinin, then fixed for confocal immu-
nofluorescence analysis. Cells on coverslips treated as de-
scribed above were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
before being fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Glass coverslips were rinsed three times
in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated-phalloi-
din (Invitrogen) for 30 min. After two final washes in PBS and
one in water, coverslips were mounted on slides using Fluor-
Save Reagent (Calbiochem). The mounting medium was
allowed to dry overnight away from light, before analysis.

To verify that PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation was
dependent on Rac1 function, we transiently transfected the cul-
tures twice at a 24-h interval, with a final concentration of 50 nM
short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Rac1 or with an irrelevant
siRNA (siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA from Dharmacon),
using the calcium phosphate method. 12 h following the second
transfection, cells were serum-starved and then PDGF-stimulated
asdescribedabove.TheRac1siRNAsequencehasbeenpreviously
described (29). Western blot analyses with mouse anti-Rac1
monoclonal antibody (clone 23A8, Upstate) were done to deter-
mine the degree of Rac1 silencing and with mouse anti-␤-actin
monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich) to verify
equivalent loading of total protein.

Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The
pGEX-Rac1, pGEX-Rac1(15A), pGEX-Rac1b, pPRO-EXHTb-
Rac2, pGEX-Rac3, pGEX-Cdc42, pGEX-Cdc42(15A), and
pPRO-EXHTb-Tiam1 DH/PH bacterial expression plasmids
have all been described previously (19, 30–34). Rac proteins
were prepared similarly as described elsewhere (30, 35, 36).
Briefly, BL21(DE3) cells expressing Rac1, Rac1b, Rac2, and
Cdc42, respectively, were incubated at 37 °C, before induction
with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-␤-D-galactopyranoside fo r 4 h at
37 °C (Rac3 required overnight induction at room tempera-
ture). GST proteins were either purified using a batch method
(30-min incubation of bacterial cell lysate with 150 ␮l of gluta-
thione-Sepharose, followed by three washes in lysis buffer (20
mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, supple-
mented with 10 ␮M GDP only for GST-Rac1(15A) and GST-
Cdc42(15A) purification), or by fast-protein liquid chromatog-
raphy using a 1-ml GSTrap FF column (Amersham

Biosciences), and subsequent concentration using centrifugal
concentrators (Vivascience). His6-Rac2, Rac1-⌬insert-His6
(37), and His6-Tiam1 DH/PH were purified by fast-protein liq-
uid chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap Ni column (Amer-
sham Biosciences), before dialysis into 20 mM Tris䡠HCl (pH
7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and subsequent concentration
of protein.

Recombinant Protein Nucleotide Loading—To load GST-
Sepharose-bound small GTPases, the bead-bound GTPases
were incubated in exchange buffer (20 mM Tris䡠HCl, 50 mM
NaCl, 500 ␮M fluorescent N-methylanthraniloyl (mant) deriv-
atives of guanine nucleotides (mant-GDP and mant-GMPPNP,
Roche Applied Science), 20 mM (NH4)2SO4), for 1 min at 37 °C,
before three washes in cold equilibration buffer (20 mM
Tris䡠HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2). Nucleotide-loaded pro-
tein was then eluted from the beads using elution buffer (20 mM
Tris䡠HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM glutathione) for 10
min on ice. To load His6-tagged proteins, the relevant protein
was incubated in exchange buffer for 1 min at 37 °C, before
being separated from excess nucleotide in a Zeba Desalting
Spin Column (Pierce Biotechnology), prepared as per manufac-
turer’s protocol.

Fluorescent

Intensity Measurements—Off-rate measure-
ments were performed in a SPEX Fluorolog-3 Research fluo-
rometer, in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (with constant stirring), with
a total of 300 ␮l of 20 mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, and 2 ␮M small GTPase䡠mant-GDP at 25 °C. Exchange
was initiated by addition of inhibitor to a final concentration of
50 ␮M or EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. Changes in
fluorescence was monitored at ␭ex ⫽ 290 nm and ␭em ⫽ 440
nm, and data were recorded by the supplied software. On-rate
measurements were performed in a Gemini Spectromax
96-well plate reader, in a 96-well plate (BD Falcon microtest
plate) with a total of 100 ␮l of 20 mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM
NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 ␮M mant-GDP, 2 ␮M small GTPase at
25 °C, and 50 ␮M of inhibitor. Exchange was initiated by addi-
tion of EDTA to a final concentration of 8 mM. Changes in
fluorescence were monitored 4 min after inhibitor addition, at
␭ex ⫽ 290 nm and ␭em ⫽ 440 nm. Data were recorded by the
supplied SOFTMax Pro software. Measurements of excitation
and emission spectra were performed in the SPEX Fluorolog-3
Research fluorometer, in 300 ␮l of 20 mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 7.5), 50
mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 ␮M inhibitor at 25 °C, in the
presence or absence of 10 ␮M Rac.

Fluorescent Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescent anisot-
ropy measurements were performed in the SPEX Fluorolog-3
Research fluorometer, set up in the polarized T format, in a
1-ml quartz cuvette (with constant stirring), with a total of 300
␮l of 20 mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 or
PAK-RBD:GTPase association analyses, GST-PAK-RBD was
titrated into 2 ␮M small GTPase䡠mant-GMPPNP in the pres-
ence or absence of 50 ␮M inhibitor (␭ex ⫽ 360 nm, ␭em ⫽ 440
nm). For inhibitor:GTPase binding analyses, aliquots of small
GTPase solution (containing 1 ␮M inhibitor) were titrated into
a solution of 1 ␮M inhibitor in the cuvette. Changes in fluores-
cence anisotropy were monitored at ␭ex ⫽ 360 nm, ␭em ⫽ 440
nm, 30 s after each addition. All data analysis and curve fitting

were performed using Microsoft Excel and QuantumSoft’s
ProFit for Mac OS X.

Affinity Precipitation of the RacGEF Tiam1—50% confluent
10-cm dish of 293T cells were transfected by using Lipofectami-
neTM 2000 (Invitrogen) with 10 ␮g of pcDNA 3.1 expression
plasmid alone (vector) or encoding Myc epitope-tagged
Tiam1(C1199), an N-terminal truncated and constitutively
activated mutant of human Tiam1 (a gift from G. Bollag, Plexx-
ikon Inc.), which has been characterized previously (38). 48 h
after transfection, the cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and a protease inhibitor mixture
tablet (Invitrogen). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 400 ␮g of total protein
extracts was used per condition. Five micrograms of either bac-
terially expressed GST, GST-Rac1(15A), or GST-Cdc42(15A),
immobilized on glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B beads (Amer-
sham Biosciences) and pre-treated with different doses of EHT
1864 for 30 min at 4 °C, was added to each condition. EHT 1864
was still present during the incubation with the lysates. The
samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the beads were
washed once with lysis buffer and twice with cold wash buffer
(50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl). Affinity-
precipitated proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a mono-
clonal anti-Myc antibody 1/1000 (clone 9E10, Sigma-Aldrich).
In Vitro Binding of RhoGDIs to Rac1—A 50% confluent
10-cm dish of 293T cells was transfected by using Lipofectami-
neTM 2000 (Invitrogen) with 5 ␮g of pcDNA 3.1 expression
plasmid alone (vector) or encoding RhoGDI1 (GDI␣/RhoGDI)
or RhoGDI2 (GDI␤/Ly/D4GDI) proteins (Guthrie cDNA
Resource Center). 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed
with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5
mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mix-
ture tablet (Invitrogen). The lysates were cleared by centrifuga-
tion at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 350 ␮g of total protein
extracts was used per condition. 10 ␮g of either bacterially
expressed GST or GST-Rac1(WT), immobilized on glutathi-
one-SepharoseTM 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), was then
used per condition. GST-Rac1 was first loaded with nucleotide
for 10 min at 37 °C in a loading buffer containing 20 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin, and 2 mM GTP␥S or GDP (150 ␮l of loading
buffer per 10 ␮g of recombinant protein). The loading reaction
was stopped by addition of MgCl2 to 15 mM on ice. GDP- or
GTP␥S-loaded GST-Rac1 was treated first with different doses
of EHT 1864 for 30 min at 4 °C and then added to the lysates,
and the samples were rotated at 4 °C fo r 1 h in thepresence or
absence of EHT 1864. The beads were washed three times with
lysis buffer, and the affinity-precipitated proteins were eluted in
protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoGDI1 antibody
1/5000 (A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a
goat polyclonal anti-RhoGDI2 antibody 1/5000 (C-20, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), respectively.

siently transfected with 50 ng of the pCGN-hygro expression
plasmid alone (vector) or encoding H-Ras(61L). Cells were
allowed to reach confluency and were maintained on complete
growth medium supplemented with 5 ␮M EHT 1864 or vehicle
until focus formation occurred. The appearance of H-Ras(61L)-
induced foci of transformed cells was quantitated after 14 days.
For establishment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected
and expressing H-Ras(61L), Rac1 WT, Rac1(61L), or
Tiam1(C1199), cells were plated at a density of 6 ⫻ 105 cells
per 10-cm dish 1 day before transfection. 4 ␮g of the pCGN-
hygro empty vector (used as a control) or encoding HA-
tagged H-Ras(61L), Rac1 WT or Rac1(61L) (39) were trans-
fected into cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Roche
Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The same procedure was used with the pcDNA3.1-neo
empty vector (control) or encoding Myc-tagged constitu-
tively activated Tiam1(C1199). Two days after transfection,
the transfected cells were replated in growth medium supple-
mented with either 200 ␮g/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied
Science) or 400 ␮g/ml G418 (Amersham Biosciences), respec-
tively. After 10 days of selection, several hundred drug resist-
ance colonies were then pooled together to establish mass pop-
ulations of stably transfected cells.

NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Rac1 WT, Rac1(61L), or
Tiam1(C1199) proteins were used for secondary focus forma-
tion assays. Cells stably transfected with the empty pCGN-hy-
gro or pcDNA3.1-neo plasmids were used as controls. For each
stable cell line, 5 ⫻ 105 fibroblasts were plated into each well of
6-well plates. Each condition was performed in duplicate. The
cultures were fed every other day with fresh complete growth
medium alone or supplemented with 5 ␮M of the compound
EHT 1864. Activated Rac1- or Tiam1-induced transformed foci
were visible after 3–4 weeks and were subsequently quantified
under an inverted phase-contrast microscope at 4⫻ magnifica-
tion. Cells were then fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and
stained with 0.4% crystal violet dye.

To determine the effects of EHT 1864 treatment on the rate
of cell proliferation, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing oncogenic
Ras were plated in 96-well plates at an initial density of 2 ⫻ 103
cells/well. The cells were cultured for up to 4 days in complete
growth medium, either alone, or supplemented with 5 ␮M EHT
1864. Cell growth was then assessed using the conversion of
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) to a formazan product (40). Briefly, the
MTT reagent (from a 5 mg/ml solution diluted in PBS) was
added to the wells at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the
cells were further incubated fo r 4 h at 37 °C. Themedium was
then removed, and the reaction was terminated by adding 100
␮l/well Me2SO. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a
microplate reader.

RESULTS

EHT 1864 Specifically Inhibits PDGF-induced Lamellipodia
Formation—Our previous pulldown analyses showed that EHT
1864 reduced the association of endogenous Rac1 but not RhoA
with the isolated GTP-dependent RBDs of PAK1 or Rhotekin,
respectively (28). Rac1 and Cdc42 share overlapping down-
stream effectors that include PAK1. Because EHT 1864 impairs

FIGURE 1. Structure and activity of EHT compounds. A, structures of EHT
compounds used in this study: EHT 1864 and EHT 8560. EHT 8560 did not
reduce the levels of RhoA-GTP, Rac1-GTP, or Cdc42-GTP when evaluated in
pulldown assays with GST-Rhotekin-RBD or GST-PAK-RBD (data not shown)
and was included as a negative control. B, EHT 1864 selectively reduces detec-
tion of Rac1-GTP. U87-MG cells were treated for 5 min with various doses of
EHT 1864. Cell lysates with equivalent total protein were then used for pull-
down analyses with GST-PAK-RBD (Rac1 and Cdc42) or GST-Rhotekin-RBD
(RhoA), resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analyses with anti-
body specific for each Rho GTPase. Data shown are representative of seven
(Rac1), nine (Cdc42), or three (RhoA) independent experiments.

Rac1 interaction with PAK-RBD, whether EHT 1864 could also
inhibit PAK-RBD association with the related Cdc42 small
GTPase remained a possibility. We therefore determined if
EHT 1864 could also impair Cdc42 effector interaction. The
structure of EHT 1864 and its related negative control com-
pound (EHT 8560) used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. As
shown in Fig. 1B, EHT 1864 treatment dose-dependently inhib-
ited association of endogenous Rac1 with PAK-RBD but did not
reduce endogenous Cdc42 interaction with PAK-RBD, demon-
strating the specificity of the compound toward Rac1 activity. It
is noteworthy that loss of Rac1 association with PAK-RBD was
not due simply to preferential loss of Rac1 expression, because
EHT 1864 did not reduce the steady-state levels of endogenous
Rac1.

To further delineate the specificity of EHT 1864 within cells
and to evaluate the ability of EHT 1864 to inhibit Rac1-medi-
ated cellular activities, we examined the effect of EHT 1864 on

EHT 1864, a Novel Rac-specific Inhibitor

FIGURE 2. EHT 1864 selectively inhibits Rac-induced lamellipodia formation. A, EHT 1864 blocks PDGF- and
not LPA- or bradykinin-induced actin reorganization. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free
growth medium, either alone, or supplemented with 5 ␮M EHT 1864 or EHT 8560 for the last 4 h. The cultures
were then stimulated for 15 min with PDGF, LPA, or bradykinin and then fixed, and actin filaments were
visualized with Alexa-phalloidin. Scale bar, 20 ␮m. Results shown are representative of three independent
experiments. B, quantitation of data shown in panel A: graphic representation of the percentage of PDGF-
stimulated cells with lamellipodia, in the presence or absence of EHT1864 or 8560, quantified on 100 cells for
each condition. Results shown are the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the ⫾S.E.
C, PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation is Rac1-dependent. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected twice
with a Rac1 siRNA or an irrelevant siRNA used as a negative control. 12 h after the second transfection, cells
were serum-starved for 16 h, then stimulated with PDGF for 15 min. Total protein extracts (20 ␮g) from treated
cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody and
anti-␤-actin antibody to verify equivalent total cell lysate protein loading. D, actin filament staining, performed
as described above. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments.

(Fig. 2, A and B). These data demon-
strate that EHT 1864 is a potent and
specific inhibitor of PDGF-induced
lamellipodia formation.

Finally, to eliminate possible cell
context differences in signaling, we
wanted to verify that PDGF-in-
duced lamellipodia in our strain of
NIH 3T3 cells was dependent on
Rac function. Although PGGF stim-
ulation of
lamellipodia has been
shown to be Rac-dependent in Swiss
3T3 and other cell types, in light of
our previous observations of signif-
icant NIH 3T3 strain variation in
cellular responses to Rho GTPase
activity (44), we felt it was important
to perform this control experiment.
We efficiently suppressed endoge-
nous Rac1 expression by interfering
RNA in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2C) and
stimulated cells with PDGF. We
found that silencing Rac1 expres-
sion strongly impaired lamellipodia
formation induced by PDGF (Fig.
2D), hence mimicking the lamelli-
podia-inhibitory effect of EHT 1864
observed in control cells expressing
Rac1. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that EHT 1864 specif-
ically blocks extracellular stimulus
induction of Rac1-mediated lamel-
lipodia formation.

Rac1-dependent cytoskeleton rearrangements and compared it
to RhoA- and Cdc42-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton
reorganization. It is known that PDGF activates Rac1 and
induces Rac-mediated membrane lamellipodia formation in
Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (41), whereas LPA is responsible for RhoA
activation, leading to RhoA-mediated formation of actin stress
fibers and focal adhesion assembly (42), and bradykinin acti-
vates Cdc42, which in turn induces actin microspike and filop-
odia formation (43). To evaluate whether EHT 1864 could spe-
cifically block PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation, we
treated serum-starved NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with EHT
1864 and then stimulated the cells for 15 min with PDGF, LPA,
or bradykinin. As shown in Fig. 2A, PDGF, LPA, and bradykinin
efficiently induce membrane ruffling and lamellipodia forma-
tion, actin stress fibers, and filopodia, respectively. However, in
the presence of EHT 1864, while LPA and bradykinin still
induced their respective changes in actin cytoskeletal organiza-
tion, PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation was blocked com-
pletely. We observed that EHT 1864-treated cells showed an
⬃80% reduction in PDGF stimulation of lamellipodia (Fig. 2B).
In contrast, the structurally related, but inactive (for inhibition
of Rac1 association with PAK-RBD) compound EHT 8560 did
not affect lamellipodia formation in PDGF-stimulated cells

EHT 1864 Inhibits Rac䡠PAK Com-
plex Formation—Our analyses in
vivo suggested that EHT 1864 decreased Rac1 interaction with
PAK-RBD. To further evaluate the mechanism of action of EHT
1864, we examined the ability of EHT 1864 to regulate this
interaction with purified recombinant proteins in vitro. For
these analyses, we evaluated the effect of EHT 1864 on the for-
mation of a Rac1䡠PAK-RBD or Cdc42䡠PAK-RBD complex, as
measured by fluorescence anisotropy. We titrated GST-PAK-
RBD into a solution containing 1 ␮M Rac䡠mant-GMPPNP or 1
␮M Cdc42䡠mant-GMPPNP, in the presence or absence of EHT
1864. We found that in the absence of EHT 1864, for both Rac
and Cdc42, fluorescence anisotropy increased (Fig. 3, A and B).
This increase reflects an increase in overall complex size and
provides a measure of the formation of a complex between the
GTPase and PAK-RBD. In the presence of 50 ␮M EHT 1864, a
concentration that causes essentially a 100% loss of Rac-PAK-
RBD interaction (Fig. 1B) (28), we observed that the complex
formation between Cdc42 and PAK-RBD was unaffected (Fig.
3A), whereas the complex formation between Rac1 and PAK-
RBD was completely inhibited (Fig. 3B). The lower relative val-
ues of anisotropy also suggest that nucleotide was lost from the
Rac1 protein, into solution. These data suggest that EHT 1864
inhibited complex formation between Rac1 and PAK-RBD and

EHT compounds, using increases in fluorescence anisotropy of
the EHT fluorophore. We titrated Rac䡠GDP against 1 ␮M EHT
1864 or EHT 8560 and monitored the increases in fluorescence
anisotropy (␭ex ⫽ 360 nm, ␭em ⫽ 410 nm). The increases in
anisotropy were then fitted to a hyperbolic binding curve (Fig.
4C). We observed that EHT 1864 bound tightly to Rac1, with a
KD ⫽ 40 nM. In contrast, as expected from its inability to block
Rac1 association with the PAK-RBD, we observed no increases
in anisotropy with Rac1 and EHT 8560. These results suggest
that EHT 1864 shows high affinity binding to Rac1.

EHT 1864 Interferes with the Process of Nucleotide Exchange—
The observed decrease in the fluorescence anisotropy value on
addition of EHT 1864 to Rac1䡠mant-GMPPNP (Fig. 3B) sug-
gested that this compound caused a release of Rac1-bound
nucleotide into solution. To examine the effect of EHT 1864 on
the state of bound nucleotide, we preloaded Rac1 with mant-
GDP, and rapidly added EHT 1864 (50 ␮M), EHT 8560 (50 ␮M),
or the Mg2⫹-chelating agent EDTA (10 mM). EDTA treatment
stimulates release of the bound nucleotide by Mg2⫹ chelation.
We monitored the changes in fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) between the mant group of the mant-GDP and
the conserved tryptophan 56 of Rac1 (␭ex ⫽ 290 nm, ␭em ⫽ 440
nm). These changes reflect the bound state of the nucleotide.
On addition of EHT 1864 or EDTA, we observed a rapid and
large decrease in fluorescence, reflecting the loss of FRET
between the Trp and mant group (Fig. 5A). These data were
fitted to a single exponential, with kobs ⫽ 0.038 s⫺1 and 0.14 s⫺1,
respectively. This decrease suggested that, like EDTA treat-
ment, EHT 1864 stimulated the rapid release of mant-GDP into
solution. In contrast, upon the addition of EHT 8560 we saw
very little change in the levels of FRET, which is consistent with
the lack of EHT 8560 binding to Rac and, therefore, its lack of
activity toward the protein.

Because EHT 1864 induced nucleotide release, we asked
whether Rac-bound EHT 1864 would be able to inhibit the re-
association of nucleotide with Rac1, when induced by either
EDTA or by a Rac-specific GEF, such as Tiam1. We incubated
Rac1 in the presence of EHT 1864 and the fluorescent nucleo-
tide analogue mant-GDP, and then initiated the exchange reac-
tion with either EDTA or the Tiam1 catalytic fragment (span-
ning the tandem Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH/PH)
domains required for RhoGEF catalytic activity (33)). We
observed that EHT 1864 caused a concentration-dependent
inhibition of the association of mant-GDP with Rac1 that was
stimulated by treatment with EDTA (Fig. 5B) or stimulation
with Tiam1 (Fig. 5C). These data, together with the nucleotide
release observed with EHT 1864, demonstrate that EHT 1864
interferes with the process of nucleotide exchange on Rac1.

EHT 1864 Does Not Affect RacGEF or RhoGDI Binding to
Rac1 in Vitro—Our results showed that EHT 1864 dose-de-
pendently inhibited the association of nucleotide with Rac1
stimulated by Tiam1. Because GEFs show preferential binding
to the nucleotide-free state of their target GTPases (45), we
analyzed whether EHT 1864 could modulate Rac1-Tiam1
interaction. For these in vitro analyses, we used a mutant ver-
sion of Rac1 that harbors a mutation analogous to the 15A
mutation that renders Ras deficient in GDP and GTP binding
(46) and binds specifically to RhoGEFs that activate Rac1 (34).

FIGURE 3. EHT 1864 inhibits Rac1 but not Cdc42 complex formation with
PAK-RBD in vitro. Fluorescence anisotropy analyses were done to determine
the ability of EHT 1864 to affect the binding of PAK-RBD to (A) Cdc42 or (B)
Rac1. Each recombinant GTPase was preloaded with the non-hydrolysable
and fluorescent mant-GMPPNP (final concentration, 2 ␮M). The changes in

that EHT 1864 causes the release of nucleotide from Rac1, but

EHT 1864 Associates Tightly with Rac1—The highly conju-
gated structure of the EHT 1864 and the inactive EHT 8560
(Fig. 1A) compounds suggests that they may be fluorescent. We
observed that both EHT 1864 and EHT 8560 fluoresced
strongly at the optimal excitation and emission wavelengths of

rescent intensity (Fig. 4B). This change in fluorescence allowed
us to measure the strength of association between Rac1 and the

the same results when the analyses
were done in NIH 3T3 cells (data
not shown).

EHT 1864 Shows Specificity for
Rac Subfamily Members—Our pull-
down and actin reorganization anal-
yses in vivo suggest that EHT 1864
specifically interacted with Rac1
and not Cdc42 or RhoA. The Rac
branch of the Rho family is com-
posed of three closely related pro-
teins, Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3, that
share significant sequence (85%)
and biochemical identity (51). Addi-
tionally, an alternative splice variant
of Rac1, Rac1b, has been found to be
expressed in human cancer cells (17,
18). Rac1b contains a 19-residue
insert sequence upstream of the
switch 2 region of Rac1, which per-
turbs
interaction with regulator
proteins and effectors and displays
biological properties of a constitu-
tively activated, transforming pro-
tein (19). Therefore, we determined
whether EHT 1864 could also act on
Rac1b, Rac2, and Rac3.

GST fusion protein of the Rac1(15A) mutant was then tested
for its ability to interact with Tiam1 in the presence or absence
of EHT 1864. A constitutively activated mutant of Tiam1,
Tiam1(C1199), was transiently overexpressed in 293T cells
(Fig. 6A) and tested for its ability to bind to and be affinity-
precipitated by the nucleotide-free Rac1(15A) mutant protein
immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig.
6B, Tiam1(C1199) specifically interacts with Rac1(15A), and
treatment with EHT 1864 did not affect this interaction. The
same results were also observed in NIH 3T3 cells (data not
shown). These data clearly demonstrate that EHT 1864 does
not interfere with RacGEF association with Rac1.

In parallel, we investigated whether EHT 1864 could impair
guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) binding to
Rac1. Both RhoGDI1 (also called RhoGDI␣/RhoGDI) and
RhoGDI2 (RhoGDI␤/Ly/D4GDI) associate with Rac1 (47, 48),
and RhoGDIs have been described to interact preferentially
with the GDP-bound form of Rac1 and to a lesser extent with
the GTP-bound state (49, 50). RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2 proteins
were then transiently expressed in 293T cells and evaluated, in
the presence or absence of EHT1864, for their ability to bind to
and be affinity-precipitated by a GST-Rac1 WT recombinant
protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and pre-
loaded with either GDP or GTP. Our results showed that both
RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2 interacted specifically with GST-Rac1
fusion protein, with a higher affinity for the GDP-bound state of
the GTPase, and this in vitro association was not altered by EHT

Using the changes in fluorescence
anisotropy of the inhibitor as a
measure of its binding to Rac family
proteins, we titrated recombinant Rac䡠GDP family proteins
into a 1 ␮M solution of inhibitor and measured the increases in
anisotropy (␭ex ⫽ 360 nm, ␭em ⫽ 410 nm) (Fig. 8A). We
observed that EHT 1864 bound to Rac1b and Rac2 with very
similar affinities as we saw with Rac1 (50 nM and 60 nM, respec-
tively). Rac3 bound with a lower affinity of ⬃250 nM. Fig. 8A
also confirmed that EHT 1864 does not bind to Cdc42. We next
examined the ability of EHT 1864 to stimulate nucleotide
release from Rac2 and Rac3 proteins. We pre-loaded the Rac
proteins with mant-GDP and observed the loss of FRET
between the conserved tryptophan group in Rac2 or Rac3, and
the mant group attached to the nucleotide, which reflects the
release of the mant nucleotide into solution. We observed that
EHT 1864 did induce nucleotide loss from Rac2 and Rac3 (Fig.
8B) with kobs of 0.023 s⫺1 and 0.0011 s⫺1, rates slower than that
of Rac1 (kobs ⫽ 0.038 s⫺1). These data suggest that EHT 1864 is
most active on Rac1, both in its binding affinity and stimulation
of nucleotide release. EHT 1864 also has significant activity on
Rac2, but much less on Rac3.

EHT 1864 Blocks Cell Transformation Induced by Constitu-
tively Activated Rac1 and by the Rac-dependent Tiam1 and Ras
Transforming Proteins—Our analyses above indicate that EHT
1864 directly antagonizes Rac function. Therefore, unlike
NSC23766, which did not block the activity of constitutively
activated Rac1(61L) (27), we anticipated that EHT 1864 would
effectively block Rac1(61L) function. It has been established
previously that Rac1(61L) can promote cellular transformation

causing for example loss of density-dependent inhibition of
growth (12, 39, 52). We performed secondary focus formation
assays using wild-type NIH 3T3 cells and cells stably expressing
either wild-type Rac1 or the constitutive active mutant
Rac1(61L) (Fig. 9A). As shown in Fig. 9B, activated Rac1(61L),
but not WT, caused focus-forming activity, and treatment of
cells with EHT 1864 significantly abolished cellular transforma-
tion induced by Rac1(61L). EHT 1864 caused an 80% inhibition
of focus-forming activity when compared with untreated cells
expressing Rac1(61L) (Fig. 9C), indicating that EHT 1864 acts
as a specific inhibitory reagent to reverse cell transformation
attributed to Rac1 activation. Because Rac1(61L) is activated by
a loss of Rho-specific GTPase-activating protein responsive-
ness, rather than RhoGEF activation, and because this mutant

As shown in Fig. 10 (A and B), EHT

inhibition of activated H-Ras(61L)-
induced focus formation. Similar
results were observed in a secondary
focus formation assay using NIH
3T3
expressing
H-Ras(61L) (data not shown). We
also evaluated the effect of EHT
1864 on the growth rate of NIH 3T3
cells stably expressing H-Ras(61L)
protein (Fig. 10C). Whereas expres-
sion of H-Ras(61L)

enhanced rate of cell growth com-
pared with control cells, treatment
of cells with EHT 1864 strongly
impaired oncogenic Ras-induced
cell proliferation to a level similar
to that of untransformed NIH 3T3
cells (Fig. 10D). In contrast, there
was only modest reduction in the
growth rate of untransformed
cells. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that the compound
EHT 1864 strongly impacts on
Ras-induced cellular transforma-
tion and suggest that inhibition of
Rac effector interaction is also an
effective strategy for blocking Ras-
mediated transformation.

DISCUSSION

our data above that EHT 1864 inhibitory activity does not
involve inhibition of RhoGEF or RhoGDI interaction. EHT
1864 also blocked the focus-forming activity of activated
Tiam1(C1199) (Fig. 9, B and C), which causes Rac-dependent
transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (52). Because we found that
EHT 1864 did not block Tiam1 interaction with Rac1, this inhi-
bition is presumably at the level of activated Rac1.

Previous studies found that Ras causes Rac activation, and
inhibition of Rac activation by the Rac1(17N) dominant nega-
tive blocked Ras-mediated growth transformation on NIH 3T3
cells (11, 12). Rac1(17N) forms non-productive complexes with
RacGEFs and prevents Rac activation. Recently, NSC23766 was
identified as a small molecule inhibitor of RacGEF-mediated
activation of Rac and of Ras-mediated growth transformation
(27). Thus, inhibition of RacGEF activation of Rac is an effective
approach for blocking Ras-transforming activity. Based on our
observations that EHT 1864 impaired cellular transformation
induced by constitutively activated mutants of Tiam1 and Rac1,
we determined whether EHT 1864 could also block Ras trans-
formation. We performed primary focus formation assays
using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transiently transfected with a consti-
tutively active Ras mutant, H-Ras(61L), and cultured in the

Rho family small GTPases are
critically involved in many signal-
ing pathways within cells, control-
ling a variety of different cellular responses (3). Their aber-
rant regulation or expression is found in a variety of disease
states, such as cancers and neurological disorders, and there-
fore Rho GTPases are validated targets for novel therapeutic
approaches (6–9, 10). However, to date, the development of
effective small molecule inhibitors that directly target Rho
family GTPases has been very limited. Currently, most pro-
gress has been made utilizing inhibitors that impair prenyl-
transferases that catalyze the lipid modifications critical for
GTPase function or block protein kinases that function
downstream of small GTPases (23, 24). We previously
reported the identification and characterization of EHT
1864, and we found that this compound blocked activated
Rac-mediated signaling, Rac association with PAK-RBD, and
blocked the Rac-dependent processing of the amyloid pre-
cursor protein (28). In the present study, we further evalu-
ated the specificity of EHT 1864 for endogenous Rac1 func-
tion, characterized its ability to interact with Rac isoforms,
the biochemical mechanism by which it blocks Rac1 func-
tion, and assessed the ability of this inhibitor to block
another Rac-dependent biological function, Ras-mediated
growth transformation. Our results suggest that EHT 1864 is

EHT 1864, a Novel Rac-specific Inhibitor

Rac1(G12V) to stimulate transcription from Jun- and NF-␬B-
responsive promoters, signaling pathways that utilize distinct
effectors (39).

One possible mechanism for EHT 1864 inhibition of Rac
association with effectors may involve binding to the switch I
(residues 30–38) and/or switch II (60–76) sequences that are
involved in Rac effector binding. Missense mutations in the
switch regions impair effector binding. Alternatively, EHT 1864
may cause a reduction in the GTP-bound state that shows
higher affinity for effector binding due to its interference in the
nucleotide exchange process and therefore the GTP-bound:
GDP-bound equilibrium within the cell. Our analyses with
recombinant Rac1 protein in vitro determined that EHT 1864
binds tightly to Rac1 (with nanomolar affinity), reducing its
affinity for nucleotide, through induction of nucleotide
release and inhibition of nucleotide binding, thus preventing
effector binding both in vitro and in vivo to Rac. Because all
Rac1 effector interactions are GTP-dependent, EHT 1864 is
expected to block Rac1 interaction with all effectors. Thus,
EHT 1864 will be expected to be more effective in blocking
Rac1 functions, when compared with inhibitors of a specific
subset of Rac1 effectors (e.g. inhibitors of PAK kinases).
Additionally, we also show that EHT 1864 binds closely
related Rac isoforms, Rac2 and Rac1b, and with a lower affin-
ity, Rac3. The activity against Rac1b is important in light of
the fact that this splice variant is constitutively activated and
transforming and preferentially expressed in breast and
colon cancers (17–19).

We observed that EHT 1864 caused a loss of nucleotide from
Rac1 in vitro. However, the mechanism for this activity is not
resolved, and structural determination of a co-complex of EHT
1864 with Rac1 will provide critical clues for this mechanism.
The absence of impact of EHT 1864 on the binding of the Rac-
specific RhoGEF, Tiam1, to Rac1, together with the ability of
EHT 1864 to inhibit cellular transformation induced by consti-
tutive activated Rac1(61L) mutant, which is GEF-independent,
argue that EHT 1864, unlike NSC23766, acts neither on
RacGEF interaction nor on GEF-induced Rac1 activation, and
instead, acts directly on the small GTPase itself. Loss of bound
nucleotide may result from direct displacement of the nucleo-
tide by EHT 1864 (by lowering the overall affinity (KD) of the
nucleotide for the GTPase?), direct displacement of Mg2⫹ or
loss of its coordination (36) by EHT 1864, or potentially
through an allosteric mechanism caused by EHT 1864 binding
at another site on the small GTPase. Our preliminary observa-
tions5 indicate that nucleotide release is more rapid when Rac is
associated with the triphosphate nucleotide, suggesting the
involvement of Mg2⫹ as a key step in the release mechanism
(36). Further biochemical analyses, such as the use of NMR to
identify Rac1 residues whose coordinates are altered by EHT
1864 binding, crystallization of the inhibitor in complex with
Rac1 for a full structural determination, and direct measure-
ment of inhibitor affinity in the presence or absence of nucleo-
tide or Mg2⫹ via SPR (such as Biacore), will be required to
completely elucidate this mechanism.

selective for Rac isoforms, binds to Rac with a high affinity,
disrupts guanine nucleotide association, causing a loss of
interaction with its effectors, and can effectively block Ras-
mediated transformation. Thus, EHT 1864 may define a
novel small molecule inhibitor scaffold that may be further
developed for directly antagonizing the function of Ras
superfamily small GTPases.

Our previous observations suggested that EHT 1864 pre-
vented Rac1 but not RhoA interaction with downstream effec-
tors. To further delineate the Rho GTPase specificity of EHT
1864, we determined that EHT 1864 selectively blocked extra-
cellular stimuli-induced activation of endogenous Rac1 and not
of RhoA or Cdc42. This inhibition was associated with a
decreased ability of PAK-RBD to pulldown-activated Rac-GTP
but not Cdc42-GTP from cells. Because Cdc42-GTP also binds
to PAK-RBD, these results argue that EHT 1864 interacts with
Rac itself, rather than with PAK-RBD. This conclusion is also
consistent with our previous observation that EHT 1864
expressed activated

switch II region (residues 60–76) of
Rac1. This has been shown to be suf-
ficient to disrupt effector interac-
tion itself (19, 30, 57, 58). That EHT
1864 is able to associate tightly with
Rac1b suggests that the extra 19
amino acids do not significantly
interfere with its binding site. Of the
three Rac proteins (1, 2, and 3), Rac1
and Rac2 are the most divergent, yet
it is to these two that EHT 1864
associates most tightly. There are
only five positions in their amino
acid sequences where Rac1 and
Rac2 are similar to each other, yet
different to Rac3: Ile-111, Lys-128,
Lys-147, Arg-187, and Lys-186. Of
these, only Ile-111, in the Rho insert
region, is located on a side of the
protein facing the nucleotide bind-
ing pocket. Yet RhoA, which is
unable to associate with EHT 1864,
also has an Ile at the equivalent posi-
tion. This may suggest further com-
plex residue-drug interaction, or
potentially an allosteric mechanism
of drug action. Due to the intricate
nature of protein/drug interfaces,
the binding site of EHT 1864 may
ultimately be best understood by a
complete structural elucidation.

Previous studies demonstrated
that Ras causes activation of Rac and
that Rac function is critical for Ras-
mediated growth transformation. In
these studies, Rac function was
blocked by use of a dominant nega-
tive Rac1(17N) mutant (11, 12),
which blocks RacGEF activation of
Rac (59), or by NSC23766, a cell-
permeable small molecule that can
bind directly to Rac1 and prevent its
activation by Rac-specific RhoGEFs
(27). In contrast to these approaches
for blocking Rac function, our stud-
ies suggest that EHT 1864 disrupts
formation of activated Rac1-GTP,
thereby disrupting Rac1 interaction
with its downstream effectors. As
anticipated from this mode of action, we also found that EHT
1864 treatment can effectively block the ability of mutationally
activated Ras to cause growth transformation. Thus, EHT 1864
may define a novel approach for the development of anti-Ras
inhibitors for cancer treatment. The 20-fold greater potency
seen with EHT 1864, when compared with the 100 ␮M concen-
tration required for NSC23766 to block Rac activity in vivo, will
facilitate our ability to evaluate the activity of EHT 1864 in
mouse tumor models.

FIGURE 9. EHT 1864 specifically reverses cell transformation induced by constitutively activated
mutants of Rac1 and Tiam1. A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were stably transfected with vectors encoding Rac1 WT or
the constitutive active mutants Rac1(61L) or Tiam1(C1199). Transfection with the empty expression plasmid
alone (Vector) served as a negative control. The expression levels of HA epitope-tagged Rac1 WT and Rac1(61L)
proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Myc-tagged Tiam1(C1199) protein
expression level was detected using an anti-Myc antibody. The amounts of ␤-actin are shown as a loading
control. B, EHT 1864 reverses focus formation induced by Rac1(61L) and Tiam1(C1199). NIH 3T3 cells stably
expressing the proteins indicated were plated and allowed to reach confluency. Cells were cultured in com-
plete growth medium, either alone or supplemented with 5 ␮M EHT 1864. The appearance of foci of cells was
observed by bright field 3– 4 weeks after plating. Cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet.
C, quantitation of data shown in panel B. The number of foci of transformed cells was analyzed by phase-
contrast microscopy. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments, each performed in
duplicate.

Binding of EHT 1864 to Rac1 is tight, with a KD ⫽ 40 nM. This
compares to the KD of GTP association with small GTPases of
⬃20–30 nM in the presence of Mg2⫹ (54–56). This tight asso-
ciation may explain the potency of ETH 1864 as observed pre-
viously (28). The KD of the interaction between EHT 1864 and
Rac1b and Rac2 was also comparable to that of Rac1 (50 nM and
60 nM, respectively), yet the KD of interaction with Rac3 is
5-fold higher (230 nM). Rac1b, an alternative splice variant of
Rac1, contains a 19-amino acid insert immediately behind the

transformation by the GAP-deficient, constitutively activated
Rac1(61L) mutant (our study and Ref. 27). Hence, EHT 1864,
and not NSC23766, is expected to be effective in blocking Rac
activation by RhoGEF-independent mechanisms. For example,
we found that EHT 1864 can bind the constitutively activated
and transforming Rac1b variant overexpressed in breast and
colon cancers. Thus, EHT 1864, and not NSC23766, is antici-
pated to be effective against tumor cells that express this Rac1
splice variant. Additionally, Rho GTPases may become acti-
vated in cancers (e.g. DLC-1) or in mental retardation (e.g. oli-
gophrenin) by the loss of Rho-specific GTPase-activating pro-
tein function, and EHT 1864, but not NSC23766, will be
effective against Rac activation by the loss of Rho-specific
GTPase-activating protein activity (61). Finally, because Ras is
mutationally activated in human cancers, the mechanism of
action of EHT 1864, and not NSC23766, may identify an
approach to develop related inhibitors specific for constitu-
tively activated Ras. In summary, EHT 1864 is not simply
another version of NSC23766 and identifies a novel pharmaco-
logic approach for Rac inhibition.

In summary, we have determined that EHT 1864 is a Rac-
specific inhibitor that directly binds and impairs the ability of
this small GTPase to engage critical downstream effectors
required for growth transformation. Despite the considerable
body of evidence implicating the aberrant function of Ras and
Rho family small GTPases in cancer and other human diseases,
there has been a striking lack of success in the pharmacologic
development of inhibitors that directly target small GTPases.
The identification of ATP-competitive inhibitors has been a
highly successful approach for the development of clinically
important protein kinase inhibitors. However, the considerably
higher affinity of binding of guanine nucleotides to small
GTPases has made GTP-competitive inhibitors an unrealistic
approach for the development of inhibitors of small GTPases.
The specificity and activity of EHT 1864 against the Rac pro-
teins represents a significant step forward in the development
of such drugs, and EHT 1864 may provide a template from
which other small GTPase drugs may be rationally designed.

hygro expression plasmid alone (Vector) or encoding constitutively activated

was determined by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. The amounts

as described above, were plated in 96-well plates at an initial density of 2 ⫻
103 cells/well. The cells were cultured for the indicated number of days in
complete growth medium, either alone, or supplemented with 5 ␮M EHT
1864, and cell proliferation was then assessed by an MTT assay. Each condi-
tion was performed in eight replicates, and the data shown are representative
of two independent experiments.

The small molecule NSC23766 is the only Rac activation
inhibitor described to date (27). When compared with this
compound, the different mode of action of EHT 1864 displays
crucial advantages. First, NSC23766 was effective against Rac1
activation by some, but not other, RhoGEFs that activate Rac1.
NSC23766 blocked Rac activation by the Rac-specific GEFs
Tiam1 and TrioN but was inactive against Vav1, a more pro-
miscuous GEF that activates Rac1, and additionally RhoA and
Cdc42 (27). EHT 1864 should be active against Rac activated by
all RacGEFs. The importance of this property is emphasized by
a recent study that found that Vav1 overexpression caused Rac-
specific and -dependent growth transformation of pancreatic
carcinoma cells (60). Hence, EHT 1864, and not NSC23766, is
expected to be an effective inhibitor of Vav1-driven pancreatic
cancers, and our future studies will evaluate this possibility.
Second, EHT 1864, and not NSC23766, is effective in blocking
