GTPase-activating proteins:

helping hands to complement an

active site

Klaus Scheffzek, Mohammad Reza
Ahmadian and Alfred Wittinghofer

Stimulation  of  the  intrinsic  GTPase  activity  of  GTP-binding  proteins  by
GTPase-activating  proteins  (GAPs)  is  a  basic  principle  of  GTP-binding-
protein  downregulation.  Recently,  the  molecular  mechanism  behind  this 
reaction  has  been  elucidated  by  studies  on  Ras  and  Rho,  and  their 
respective GAPs. The basic features involve stabilizing the existing catalytic
machinery  and  supplementing  it  by  an  external  arginine  residue.  This 
represents a novel mechanism for enzyme active-site formation.

GTP HYDROLYSIS IS a key process in in-
tracellular 
transduction.
Numerous  vital  processes, 
including
protein  synthesis,  visual  perception,
vesicular  and  nucleocytoplasmic  trans-
port,  protein  targeting,  growth  control
and differentiation, are controlled enzy-
matically  by  the  conversion  of  GTP  to
GDP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)1. GTP-
binding  proteins  are  the  molecular 
machines that catalyse this reaction. As
essential  factors  in  protein  biosynthe-
sis,  heterotrimeric  G  proteins  or  small
Ras-related  GTP-binding  proteins  func-
tion as molecular switches that cycle be-
tween  GTP-bound  ‘ON’  and  GDP-bound
‘OFF’ states. Exchange of the bound GDP
is 
facilitated  by  guanine-nucleotide-
exchange factors (GEFs), which increase
the  dissociation  rate  of  nucleotides.
This  promotes  binding  of  GTP,  which 
allows the GTP-binding proteins to inter-
act  with  effector  molecules.  Hydrolysis
of bound GTP is the timing mechanism
that returns these proteins to their GDP-
bound OFF state and thereby completes
what is called the GTPase cycle1,2. 

GTP-hydrolysis  by  GTP-binding  pro-
teins is intrinsically very slow but can be
accelerated by orders of magnitude upon
interaction  with  GTPase-activating  pro-
teins (GAPs)3, which are specific for their

respective  GTP-binding  proteins4.  GAPs
are primarily downregulators of the GTP-
bound  form,  but  some  are  also  active 
signal transduction molecules. For exam-
ple,  the  Ras-specific  p120GAP  contains
signalling  domains  that  have  a  dramatic
impact  on  the  reorganization  of  the 
cytoskeleton5. The importance of GTPase
regulation is evident from diseases associ-
ated with mutations in either GTP-binding
proteins  themselves  or  GAPs:  certain
GTP-binding-protein  mutants  are  onco-
proteins6; and loss of GAP function (as a
consequence of disruption or mutation of
the presumed tumour-suppressor gene) is
responsible for the disease phenotype in
type 1 neurofibromatosis patients7.

GTPase activation – ten years after

During  microinjection  studies  of  Ras
(originally  termed  p21ras) 
function,
Trahey  and  McCormick  noticed  that,
contrary to observations in vitro, in vivo
‘Gly12p21 was predominantly guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-bound because of a
dramatic stimulation of Gly12p21-associ-
ated guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)
activity’8. The cytosolic protein respon-
sible  for  this  increased  activity,  now
known  as  p120GAP,  stimulated  GTP-
hydrolysis  by  normal  Ras in  vitro,  but
had no effect on oncogenic Ras mutants8,9.
Since the discovery of this first GTPase-
activating  protein,  many  studies  have
shown GTPase activation to be a general
regulatory principle within systems that
involve  GTP-binding  proteins  and  have
provided  considerable  insight  into  the
mechanism of GAP action.

GAPs  that  are  specific  for  the  Ras,
Rho,  Rab,  Ran  and  Arf  subfamilies 
of  Ras-related  GTP-binding  proteins
have been described (see Box 1, p. 260).
Although members of any one subfamily
share  sequence  homology,  GAPs  from
different subfamilies do not4. Accordingly,
they  are  termed  RasGAPs,  RhoGAPs,
etc.  Modular  architecture  is  commonly
used  to  combine  the  downregulatory 
activity of GAPs with various other func-
tions, 
including  signalling.  Originally 
detected genetically in yeast, as negative
regulators of G-protein signalling (RGSs),
a  large  number  of  GAPs  that  target 
heterotrimeric-G-protein a subunits (Gas)
have been described recently10. 

The  variability  of  GAP  function  is
demonstrated  by  elongation  factor  Tu
(EF-Tu). EF-Tu possesses an almost un-
measurable,  intrinsic  GTPase  activity,
which is stimulated dramatically by the
large subunit of the mRNA-primed ribo-
some.  It  has  been  proposed  that  the
L7/L12  protein  C-terminal  domain  acts
as an EF-TuGAP (Ref. 11). FtsY and Ffh,
the  Escherichia  coli homologues  of  the
signal-recognition particle (SRP) and its
receptor,  respectively,  catalyse 
the 
cotranslational targeting of proteins into
membranes.  By  a  mechanism  that 
remains  to  be  defined,  they  stimulate
each other’s GTPase activity12.

Most  of  the  concepts  underlying  the
function  and  biochemical
structure, 
mechanism  of  small  GTP-binding  pro-
teins  have  been  derived  from  studies 
on  Ras1,2,6.  During  the  past  two  years,
Ras has again come into focus: studies
on  the  Ras–RasGAP  system  have  eluci-
dated  the  mechanism  behind  GAP
catalysis,  both  biochemically13,14 and 
terms  of  structural  biology15,16. 
in 
This  mechanism  has  been  confirmed, 
independently,  by  biochemical  and
structural  studies  of  the  Rho–RhoGAP
system17–21.  These  two  systems  are
therefore the focus of this review.

lated  by  actin.  By  contrast,  in  both 
intrinsic  and  GAP-stimulated  reactions,
the release of Pi by GTP-binding proteins
is  not  rate  limiting22,23.  Two  models  for
the mechanism of GAP action have been
discussed. The first postulates that the
GTP-binding protein is itself an efficient
GTPase and that GAP acts catalytically
to drive the GTP-binding protein into an
enzymatically competent conformation.
Experiments using fluorescently labelled
GTP analogues designed to test such a
model  yielded  conflicting  results24–26.
The  second  hypothesis  proposes  that
GAP participates actively in the process
of  GTP  hydrolysis,  possibly  by  con-
tributing a catalytic residue to the active
site; 
this  case,  stoichiometric
amounts  of  GAP  would  be  needed 
for catalysis3. The latter model is based
on  the  structure  of  very  efficient 
phosphoryl-transfer  enzymes,  such  as
adenylate  kinase,  where  a  number  of
positively charged residues are involved
in catalysis27.

Experiments with aluminium fluoride

A  major  breakthrough  in  the  eluci-
dation of the nature of GTPase acceler-
ation  came  from  studies  using  fluor-
escently  labelled  guanine  nucleotides
and aluminium fluoride (AlFx). AlFx was
originally found to activate heterotrimeric
G  proteins  in  their  inactive  GDP-bound
state28.  The  hypothesis  that  AlFx was
trapped in the g-phosphate-binding site,
thereby  mimicking  at 
least  some 

aspects  of  the  GTP-bound  form,  was
confirmed  by  the  crystal  structures  of
Ga–AlFx complexes.  In  addition,  these

the transition state in the GTPase reac-
tion29,30. On the basis of numerous stud-
ies on GTP- and ATP-converting enzymes,
aluminium fluoride is now considered to
be  a  general  mimic  of  the  phosphoryl
group transferred in GTP/ATP hydrolysis
and other phosphotransfer reactions31.

The observations that Ras–GDP does
not bind AlFx (Ref. 32) and that the helical
domain in the effector region (as defined
in Ras) of Ga subunits acts as an internal
GAP  (Ref.  2)  prompted  studies  of  the 
2–Ras interac-
effect of RasGAPs on the AlF4
tion. Indeed, Ras–GDP forms a stoichio-
metric complex with AlFx in the presence
of  NF1-333  or  GAP-334,  the  catalytic 
domains of neurofibromin and p120GAP,
respectively13. Complex formation does

genic mutant of Ras is used. The experi-
ments  using  transition-state  analogues
favoured  the  hypothesis  that  GAPs  ac-
tively participate in the process of Ras-
mediated  GTP  hydrolysis.  The  general
implications of the AlFx experiments, for
the interaction between GAPs and their
respective  GTP-binding  proteins,  are 
obvious from studies of the Rho system.
Stable  complexes  between  Cdc42–GDP

and RhoGAP can form in the presence of

Rap have yielded similar results17.

Gai–GDP–AIF4

Structures of GTPase-activating proteins

Numerous  GAPs  that  are  specific  for
Rho/Rac/Cdc42  have  been  identified, 
including  p190  and  p50.  The  RhoGAP-
like domain of the p85 subunit of phos-
phoinositide  3-kinase  comprises  a  200-
residue  helical  protein18 that  is  highly
similar  in  structure  to  the  correspond-
ing domain of p50RhoGAP (Ref. 19) but
has no GAP activity33. Its core contains 
a  four-helix  bundle,  one  face  of  which
contains  most  of 
the  conserved
residues  and  has  been  proposed  to  be
the G-protein-binding site (Fig. 1a)18,19.

Of  the  five  mammalian  RasGAPs  de-
scribed  to  date,  p120GAP  and  neurofi-
bromin  are  the  best  studied34.  The 
catalytic fragment of p120GAP, GAP-334,
is a helical, elongated protein (Fig 1b)15.

Gly12 lies sufficiently close to the finger

Box 1. Are all GTP-
binding proteins
switched off by
arginine fingers?

The increasing number of new GTPase
activating proteins (GAPs) identified for
members of subfamilies of GTP-binding
proteins such as Rap, Ran, Arf, Ypt and
elongation factors prompted us to
analyse the sequence relationships
between the various GAP subfamilies in
order to identify possible catalytic
arginine residues. GAPs within a sub-
family share high sequence similarity,
but the degree of sequence similarity
between subfamilies is lowa–g. 
Nevertheless, we were able to identify
sequence motifs that contain invariant
arginine residues within the GAPs de-
scribed for the Rap, Ypt, Ran and Arf
proteins [motifs 1, 2 and 3 (see figure)].
The ribosomal L7/L12-proteins, which
are proposed to be GAPs for elongation
factorsh, contain one invariant arginine
conserved in 38 protein sequences
analysed from different bacteria and
chloroplasts.

The arginine-finger hypothesis is

strongly supported by biochemical and
structural data on RasGAPs and
RhoGAPs showing that the arginine
finger (motif 1) is the primary element
required for GTPase-rate enhancement.
The second invariant arginine residue
in RasGAPs (motif 2) stabilizes the
finger loop, a function that appears to
be dependent on a conserved lysine
residue at the equivalent position in
RhoGAPs (Fig. 2 in review). The Rho
and Ras systems reveal characteristics
that might be common to other
arginine fingers. The catalytic residues
in RasGAPs and RhoGAPs are located in
the N-terminal portion of the catalytic
domains (motif 1). Although RasGAPs
and RhoGAPs do not share obvious
sequence homology, their structures
are related. It is therefore likely that 
the putative arginine fingers in

half of the protein’s catalytic domain
(motif 1). Interestingly, the motif-1-
arginine residues are preceded by an
aromatic amino acid residue
(phenylalanine or tyrosine) in RasGAPs,
RhoGAPs, RapGAPs and YPTGAPs. In
RasGAPs and RhoGAPs, this aromatic
amino acid residue stabilizes the adjacent
hydrophobic core and balances the
orientation of the arginine finger. This
hydrophobic stabilization, however, is not
realized in all GAPs. In RanGAP and
ArfGAP, and in the presumed GAP for the
elongation factors L7/L12, the invariant
arginine residues are not preceded by an
aromatic residue. Furthermore, ARD1 is
an Arf protein that has an ArfGAP domain
in the N-terminal regioni. The invariant
arginine residue (Arg164) in the ArfGAP
domain of ARD1 has recently been shown
to be critical for the ARD1 GAP activity. Its
replacement by a glycine residue almost
completely abolishes GTP-hydrolysisi,
which supports the proposal that it is in
fact an arginine finger.

Although the evidence is far from

conclusive, and the structural data for the
other GAPs are not available, our analysis
of GAPs has identified a limited number of
arginine residues that are good
candidates for arginine fingers. Arginine
fingers must meet the following
requirements: (1) they are invariant
within a subfamily of GAPs; (2) they
cannot be replaced, not even by a lysine
residue; (3) a mutation in the residue
drastically impairs GAP activity without
changing binding affinity. In other words,
the critical arginine finger should show up
if it is broken by site-directed mutagenesis.

occur  upon  formation  of  the  transition
state. These involve a 208, rigid, body ro-
tation  of  the  two  proteins  relative  to
each  other21.  In  the  ground-state  com-
plex, Arg85 contacts the P-loop of Cdc42
and is not in a position that would sup-
port catalysis. Phosphorus-NMR experi-
ments  using  Ras  have  shown  that  the
presence  of  RasGAP  does  not  induce 
a  chemical-shift  change  in  any  of  the
Ras–GppNHp-complex  phosphate  reso-
nances, which would be expected if they
were contacted by a positively charged
arginine side chain38. This, together with
biochemical  studies,  suggests  that,  as
with  RhoGAP, 
finger 
arginine is not in a position that would
accelerate GTP-hydrolysis, in the ground
state of the RasGAP–Ras complex.

the  RasGAP 

As  in  the  Ras–RasGAP  complex16,
larger  side  chains  at  the  critical  Gly12
position  in  Cdc42/RhoA  can  be  accom-
modated in the ground state but would
cause steric hindrance upon transition-
state  formation  (K.  Rittinger  and  S.
Smerdon, pers. commun.). This explains
why  these  mutants  bind,  but  are  not
sensitive  to,  GAP,  although  the  confor-
mational  changes  observed  in  these
studies did not involve complexes con-
taining identical GTP-binding species.

Ga proteins  differ  from  small  GTP-
binding proteins in that they contain an
additional helical domain that is appar-
ently  important  for  positioning  a  cata-
lytically 
important  arginine  residue
such that it contacts the nucleotide and
a  fluoride  ligand  in  the  complex  with
2 (Refs  29,  30).  The  crystal
GDP–AlF4
structure of the complex with RGS4 re-
vealed that RGS4 has a helical architec-
ture (Fig. 1c)39 and that it predominantly
contacts the switch regions of Ga. RGS4
is  therefore  believed  to  stabilize  the
transition state by reducing the mobility
of these regions, and thus acts similarly
to RasGAPs and RhoGAPs.

The mechanism of GTPase activation

Arginine  and  lysine  residues  play 
critical roles in phosphoryl-transfer reac-
tions.  Positively  charged  under  physio-
logical  conditions,  these  residues  are
able to neutralize negative charges that
develop on the transferred phosphoryl
group  or  the  leaving  group  oxygen, 
depending  on  whether  the  mechanism
is associative or dissociative40. In addi-
tion, their side chains are comparatively
long, which allows them to bridge larger
distances at the protein–protein-complex
interfaces. In nucleoside monophosphate
kinases,  arginine  residues  are  essential
for catalysis27.

Common principles in the requirements for efficient GTP-hydrolysis. The universal G domain
(shown in yellow) contains a number of functionally important residues, especially a critical
glutamine, that provide the scaffold for the active site. (a) In heterotrimeric-G-protein a sub-
units (Gas; shown in yellow), a catalytically essential arginine is supplied in cis and pos-
itioned by an inserted helical domain (shown in orange), which is supplemented by a regu-
lator of G-protein signalling (RGS; shown in pink) that stabilizes the switch regions. (b) In
the case of the small GTP-binding proteins Ras and Rho (shown in yellow), the arginine
residue is supplied in trans, by GAPs (shown in pink). The GAP also provides components
that stabilize the switch regions. Sw, Switch.

In  RhoGAPs  and  RasGAPs,  invariant
arginines are critical for interaction with
the  GTP-binding  protein15,19.  In  GAP-334,
Arg789 (Arg1276 in neurofibromin) is ex-
tremely  important  for  GTPase  acceler-
ation; even conservative mutation of this
residue,  to  lysine,  has  dramatic  effects.
Arg903  (Arg1301)  is  less  critical,  but 
double  mutants  such  as  Arg789ﬁLys
Arg903ﬁAla are unable to accelerate the
GTPase activity beyond the intrinsic rate
of Ras-mediated GTP hydrolysis14. These
observations are in very good agreement
with  the  structure  of  the  Ras–GAP-334
complex.  Arg789  points  into  the  active
site  and  neutralizes  negative  charges,
and, by means of the finger loop, anchors
Gln61. This stabilizes the transition state
(as  represented  by  Ras–GDP–AlF3).  As
one would expect, mutation of the invari-
ant  ‘finger’  arginine  in  p190  has  a  detri-
mental  effect  on  catalysis 
in  Rho
proteins41. The finger loop is stabilized by
Arg903.  Interestingly,  an  invariant  lysine
residue (Lys122) seems to play the role of
this  residue  in  the  RhoGAP  system  (Fig.
2). Gln61 apparently positions the water
molecule for nucleophilic attack and sta-
bilizes the transferred phosphoryl group.
The  structures  of  Rho  and  Ras  in  com-
plexes  with  their  respective  GAPs  did 
not reveal a general base for the activation
of the nucleophilic water molecule, which
is  consistent  with  the  notion  that  the 
proposed  mechanism  of 
substrate-
assisted  catalysis42 also  applies  to  the
GAP-catalysed reaction43.

By comparing the roles of GAPs with
those  of  RGSs,  we  can  conclude  that 
least  two
nature  has  developed  at 

themes in order to realize efficient GTP
hydrolysis: (1) use of arginine residues
for  stabilizing  the  transition  state;  (2)
stabilization  of  the  switch  regions  in
order to optimize the orientation of the
catalytic machinery in the GTP-binding
protein, the most important element of
which  is  a  glutamine  residue.  In  het-
erotrimeric  G  proteins  the  critical  argi-
nine residue is part of the GTP-binding
protein itself and is supplied in cis with
an  extra  domain  necessary  for  orien-
tation and an extra protein (RGS) required
for  proper  alignment  of  the  entire 
machinery  (Fig.  3a).  For  Ras-related
GTP-binding  proteins,  this  residue  is
supplied  as  an  arginine  finger  (i.e. 
in trans) by the respective GAP (Fig. 3b).
Stabilization  of  the  switch  region  is 
best  documented  in  Ras,  where  the
Gln61  region  is  highly  mobile  in  the 
isolated protein44–46.

Although  the  basic  features  of  GAP-
catalysed  GTPase  reactions  have  been
worked out, many questions remain. For
example,  why  do  most  known  phos-
phoryl-transfer  enzymes  prefer  arginine
residues for catalysis? Why do we find dif-
2 or AlF3)
ferently coordinated AlFx (AlF4
in the active sites? We also do not know
how the transition-state mimic containing
AlFx,  which  is  kinetically  and  thermody-
namically  very  stable,  is  related  to  the
high-energy  state  of  the  real  transition
state. In addition, do AAPs such as DnaJ
work  in  a  similar  manner?  What  is  the
mechanism  of  phosphoryl  transfer  in

charged amino acid residue in the active
site47? Clever studies have to be designed
in order to answer these questions.

A heterodimeric enzyme

Transition-state  stabilization  is  the
basic  principle  of  enzyme  catalysis. 
In  GTP-binding  proteins,  a  substrate-
binding  site  is  formed  by  amino  acid
residues  derived  from  fingerprint  se-
quence motifs, and the catalytic machin-
ery is in principle able to perform GTP
cleavage  at  a  rate  significantly  greater
than  that  of  spontaneous  hydrolysis  in
water.  However,  this  rate  is  increased
even  more  upon 
interaction  with 
GAPs, in a way that represents a novel
biological principle.

What  is  special  about  this  enzyme?
Nature  has  developed  numerous  strat-
egies  for  optimizing  metabolism  and  for
regulating  enzyme  activities,  such  as 
allosteric  control,  proteolytic  activation,
reversible covalent modification and acti-
vation  by  control  proteins.  Enzymes  are
also commonly composed of two or more
subunits,  and  the  active  site  can  be
shared between subunits – a strategy that
optimizes  regulation  and  formation  of 
the  induced-fit  conformation  required 
for  catalysis. 
the  Ras–RasGAP/
Rho–RhoGAP  system,  the  active  site  is
shared  by  two  completely  different  pro-
teins. They come together as a transient
heterodimeric  enzyme,  in  order  to  cata-
lyse  GTP-hydrolysis,  and  separate  after
the job is done.

In 

localized 

Separation of components of the enzy-
matic machinery is of major physiologi-
cal  importance.  p120GAP  is  a  cytosolic
protein  and  becomes 
to 
the  plasma  membrane  by  binding
(through its SH2 domain) to activated re-
ceptor  tyrosine  kinases,  such  as  the
platelet-derived-growth-factor  receptor.
Considering the low affinity of p120GAP
for Ras–GTP, which is in the micromolar
range, and the low concentrations of the
reaction partners, it seems reasonable to
assume that GAP acts on Ras only when
both  are  localized  to  the  plasma  mem-
brane (where the local concentration in
the two-dimensional space is very high).
Neurofibromin  is  predominantly  cyto-
plasmic and has been found attached to
microtubules,  where  it  might  not  be
available  for  Ras  downregulation  under
normal conditions. The affinity of neuro-
fibromin  for  Ras–GTP  is  about  50-fold
higher than that of p120GAP, which indi-
cates  a  differential  requirement  for  the
GAP reaction. Other GAP isoforms might
also exhibit differential behaviour; how-
ever, detailed knowledge is limited.
262

Another reason for the physical separ-
ation of the GTPase active centre could
be a requirement for efficient and ineffi-
cient  GTPase  machineries  under  differ-
ent  physiological  conditions.  In  order 
to  avoid  unnecessary  GTP  turnover 
because  of  nucleotide  exchange  and
GTP-hydrolysis, both reactions are very
slow in the absence of GEFs and GAPs,
respectively.  Only  when  the  signalling
mechanisms of the cell require fast Ras
activation  or  deactivation  do  external
factors increase the rates of these reac-
tions. It appears that the newly discov-
ered principle that an inefficient GTPase
centre  is  complemented,  under  certain
physiological conditions, by a GAP is a
universal  principle  in  the  regulation  of
many if not all GTP-binding proteins.
