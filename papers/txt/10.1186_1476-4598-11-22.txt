Abstract

Background: TAK733 is a novel allosteric, non-ATP-binding, inhibitor of the BRAF substrates MEK-1/2.
Methods: The growth inhibitory effects of TAK733 were assessed in a panel of 27 cutaneous and five uveal
melanoma cell lines genotyped for driver oncogenic mutations. Flow cytometry, Western blots and metabolic tracer
uptake assays were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to TAK733.
Results: Fourteen cutaneous melanoma cell lines with different driver mutations were sensitive to the
antiproliferative effects of TAK733, with a higher proportion of BRAFV600E mutant cell lines being highly sensitive with
IC50s below 1 nM. The five uveal melanoma cell lines had GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and were either moderately
or highly sensitive to TAK733. The tested cell lines wild type for NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ and GNA11 driver mutations
were moderately to highly resistant to TAK733. TAK733 led to a decrease in pERK and G1 arrest in most of these
melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin, driver oncogenic mutations and in vitro sensitivity to TAK733. MEK
inhibition resulted in increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and GNAQ mutant cell lines than in
BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. Uptake of the metabolic tracers FDG and FLT was inhibited by TAK733 in a manner that
closely paralleled the in vitro sensitivity assays.
Conclusions: The MEK inhibitor TAK733 has antitumor properties in melanoma cell lines with different oncogenic
mutations and these effects could be detectable by differential metabolic tracer uptake.

Introduction
Most melanomas have mutually-exclusive activating muta-
tions in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path-
way involving NRAS or BRAF genes in melanomas of skin
primary, c-Kit in acral and mucosal melanomas, and GNAQ
and GNA11 in uveal melanomas [1-5]. These mutations
render melanoma cells independent of the normal receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated pathway regulation, and
constitutively drive melanoma cells to oncogenic prolifera-
tion and survival [6]. The most common of these mutations

is the BRAFV600E mutation, present in approximately 50%
of melanomas of skin origin. BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous
melanomas are dependent on MAPK signaling for cell-
cycle progression and proliferation, and have high sensitivity
to type I BRAF inhibitors and to MEK inhibitors [7-10].
Very high response rates and improved survival have been
noted with the administration of the type I BRAF inhibitor
vemurafenib (formerly PLX4032/RG7204) to patients with
BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous metastatic melanoma
[11-13]. Tumor responses were dependent on the presence
of the BRAFV600E oncogene and efficient inhibition of
the MAPK pathway as detected by decreased phosphor-
ylation of ERK [8]. Inhibition of the immediately down-
stream MEK1/2 kinases in BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous
melanoma was shown to lead to marked inhibition of

cell proliferation in cell lines [7]. The attractiveness of
inhibiting at the level of MEK is supported by the very
high kinase specificity of allosteric MEK inhibitors and
the fact that MEK1/2 kinases are critically positioned as
a funnel in the MAPK pathway downstream of the three
RAS isoforms and the three RAF isoforms. Therefore,
the inhibition of MEK1/2 with specific MEK inhibitors
may result in blocking MAPK signaling from multiple
upstream oncogenes. Preclinical studies suggest
that
some NRAS-mutant cutaneous melanomas may also
exhibit sensitivity to RAF or MEK inhibition [14], whereas
KRAS mutations have conferred only marginal sensitivity
[15]. Gene expression profiling studies mapping the gene
signatures downstream of a constitutively activated MAPK
pathway suggested that cutaneous melanoma cell
lines
with NRAS mutations are less dependent in signaling
through this pathway compared to BRAFV600E mutant cu-
taneous melanoma cell lines [10,16], explaining in part the
differential sensitivity of NRAS and BRAF mutant cells to
MEK inhibitors [7].

BRAF and NRAS mutations are absent in melanomas
arising in the uveal layer of the eye, but mutually exclusive
somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-
subunit, GNAQ, or in GNA11, are present in the great
majority of uveal melanomas [4,5]. It had long been noted
that uveal melanomas have constitutive MAPK signaling
[17,18], and it is now understood that it is because of the
presence of GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. These muta-
tions occur in codons 183 or 209 in the Ras-like domain
and result in constitutive activation, turning the GNA pro-
teins into dominant-acting oncogenes signaling through
the MAPK pathway [4]. GNAQ knockdown, as well as
treatment with the U0126 MEK inhibitor, resulted in inhib-
ition of MAPK signaling and loss of viability [4]. Therefore,
MEK inhibition may be a way to treat metastatic melanoma
of uveal origin, a disease that has been highly refractory to
most therapies tested to date.

TAK733 represents a novel and distinct inhibitor of
MEK that is capable of allosteric inhibition of the RAF
substrates MEK-1 and MEK-2 [19]. This compound has
been characterized extensively and shown to possess
desirable drug-like attributes [20]. In the current studies
we have analyzed the sensitivity and resistance of human
cutaneous and uveal melanoma cell lines to this novel
MEK inhibitor, with analysis of the oncogenic driver
mutations and downstream signaling alterations and
functional effects.

and only one was highly sensitive to TAK733 with IC50s
below 1 nM, while two were considered sensitive with
IC50 less than 10 nM. All five uveal melanoma cell
lines were sensitive to TAK733 with IC50 values below
10 nM, with three of them being highly sensitive. All
these cell lines carried GNAQ or GNA11 driver muta-
tions (Figure 1 and Table 1). Overall, there was a clear
trend of higher sensitivity in BRAF mutant cell lines,
but all subgroups included cell lines with variable sen-
sitivity and also high resistance to exposure to the MEK
inhibitor.

TAK733 has similar inhibitory effects on cell cycle in
sensitive and resistant cutaneous melanoma cell lines
To study the effects of TAK733 on cell cycle progression
downstream of MEK signaling we used DAPI flow cyto-
metric staining (representative examples of flow histo-
grams in Figure 2a and b). For these studies we chose
two NRAS mutants and four BRAF mutants that repre-
sented the spectrum of sensitivities of these cell lines.
The NRAS mutants M207 (sensitive) and M244 (highly
resistant) both had a dose-dependent G1 arrest with in-
creasing concentrations of TAK733 (Figure 2c). The
same was evident with the four BRAF mutants, includ-
ing the two with high sensitivity (M229 and M249) and
the highly resistant (M233 and M263). The sub-G1
peak also did not predict the cell proliferation assay
results, even though the sharpest
increase was in
M249, one of the most sensitive cell lines (Figure 2 a
and c). Overall, TAK733 exposure for up to 48 hours
led to a similar G1 arrest in melanoma cell lines regard-
less of their origin, driver oncogenic mutations and
in vitro sensitivity to TAK733).

TAK733. Among the NRASQ61L mutant cutaneous
group we chose the resistant M244 and the sensitive
M207. Among the BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous group
we chose M229 and M249 as representatives of highly
sensitive cutaneous cell lines, and M233 and M263 as
resistant cutaneous cell lines. In our panel, all the uveal
melanoma cell lines were sensitive to TAK733 and we
picked three as representative samples with GNAQ
mutations. As expected based on prior data [21], MEK
inhibition resulted in increase of pMEK in non-
BRAFV600E mutant cell lines (Figure 3). This was more
prominent in NRASQ61L mutant and uveal melanoma
cell lines than in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines, which
had a higher baseline level of pMEK. In all cases,
TAK733 induced a marked dose-dependent decrease of
pERK, regardless of the driver oncogenic mutation or
the sensitivity or resistance to this agent in cell viability
assays. On the contrary, effects on pAKT and pS6K var-
ied according to the cell origin, oncogenic events and
sensitivity to TAK733. BRAFV600E mutant cell lines re-
sistant to TAK733 showed no inhibition of pAKT or
pS6K, while there was a general trend towards inhibition
of these two phosphorylated molecules in sensitive cell
lines. Of note, in the uveal melanoma cell lines and in the
cutaneous melanoma cell line M229, the baseline level of
pAKT was undetectable by Western blot, so no inhibition

could be recorded in them. Changes in pS6 tended to
follow changes in pS6K in the cutaneous melanoma cell
lines but not in the uveal melanoma cell lines. In a time-
course analysis of signaling events upon exposure to
TAK733, both the sensitive M229 and the resistant M233
cell lines with BRAFV600E mutations showed initial inhib-
ition of pERK, but the resistant cell line recovered pERK
signaling with time (Additional file 2: Figure S2). This
different time-course effect was not evident for the in-
hibition of pAKT or pS6K in the resistant cell line, while
they were permanently inhibited over the 48 hour study
period in the sensitive cell line.

Differential metabolic tracer uptake between cell lines
sensitive and resistant to TAK733
We explored the use of metabolic tracers to differentiate
response or resistance to TAK733 in six cutaneous mel-
anoma cell lines with the goal of a future use of these
tracers in PET scanning studies in the clinic. Thymidine
is taken up by proliferating cells and the PET tracer
[18 F]FLT can be used in patients. Consistent with the cell
cycle analysis data, all the tested cell lines had some
degree of inhibition of tritium-labeled thymidine (3H-
thymidine) uptake upon exposure to TAK733 regardless
of their sensitivity in vitro. The highest levels of inhibition
were in the highly sensitive BRAFV600E mutant cell lines

Discussion
Initial data testing MEK inhibitors in melanoma cell
lines suggested a high level and selective sensitivity in
BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines, with low sensi-
tivity in melanoma cell lines with other driver onco-
genes [7]. Further testing with expanded panels of cell
lines has confirmed a trend towards higher sensitivity
in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma, but has also provided
evidence that some melanoma cell lines with NRAS ac-
tivating mutations are sensitive to MEK inhibitors
[10,14]. The higher sensitivity of BRAF mutant cell
lines compared to NRAS mutant cell lines is generally
represented in our series, but some BRAF mutants have
high resistance to the MEK inhibitor while some NRAS

mutants are sensitive. It is certainly possible that our
BRAFV600E mutant
is
skewed for cell lines with natural resistance to inhibition
of
since we have previously
reported a similar greater than expected frequency of
cutaneous cell lines resistant to the type I BRAF inhibitor
vemurafenib [9,22]. The molecular basis for this relative
high frequency of natural resistance of BRAFV600E mutant
cutaneous melanoma cell lines in our series is currently not
well understood. Initial exploration of secondary oncogenic
events in the PI3K/AKT pathway (such as PTEN deletions)
did not clearly differentiate naturally sensitive and resist-
ant BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous melanomas to the
BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, but downstream signaling

studies did suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway may be
involved [9,22]. In the current studies we noted the
same phenomenon, a lack of correlation between natural
sensitivity and resistance to TAK733 based solely on
oncogenic analysis of the cell lines using SNP arrays or
targeted oncogene sequencing for mutations frequently
present in cancer. However, there was a suggestion from
Western blot analyses of signaling pathways that differ-
ential effects of MEK inhibitor altering signaling
through the PI3K/AKT pathway may be related to resist-
ance. This observation may provide means to explore
combinations of MEK inhibitors with PI3K or AKT inhi-
bitors that may be useful in NRAS or BRAF mutant mel-
anomas, which could be due to hyperactive receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling leading to resistance [22-24].

BRAF has only MEK as a substrate for activation
[6], and as discussed cutaneous cell
lines with the
BRAFV600E mutation frequently have high sensitivity
in vitro [7]. However, patients
to MEK inhibitors
with BRAFV600E mutant cutaneous metastatic melan-
oma enrolled in clinical trials testing MEK inhibitors
[25,26] have lower response rates than the use of the
type I BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib
(GSK2118436) in the same population [11,13,27]. The
this discrepancy between in vitro and
reason for
in vivo results with MEK inhibitors is not clearly
understood at this time, but it may be related to a

lower therapeutic window of MEK inhibitors in the
clinic compared to type I BRAF inhibitors. This could be
explained by the paradoxical activation of the MAPK
pathway in BRAF wild type cutaneous cells, where type I
BRAF inhibitors increase (or do not change) MAPK sig-
naling in normal cells, while they efficiently block the
MAPK pathway downstream of oncogenic BRAFV600.
On the contrary, MEK inhibitors can equally block the
MAPK pathway downstream of both oncogenic and wild
type BRAF. This lack of differentiation most
likely
causes the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at exposures
in vivo that do not adequately block the MAPK pathway
in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma. Despite this, MEK
inhibitors are likely to have a role in the treatment of
cancers with constitutive MAPK signaling from onco-
genic mutations upstream of MEK. In particular the
combination of MEK and RAF inhibitors may be benefi-
cial by inducing higher MAPK inhibition in mutant
cells and therefore lowering the cancer escape mechan-
isms and also decreasing toxicities from paradoxical
MAPK activation [28], such as the development of cuta-
neous squamous cell carcinomas [29].

The majority of uveal melanomas bear a mutually ex-
clusive activating mutation in either GNAQ or GNA11,
resulting in overlapping functions in melanoma cells
with the constitutive upregulation of the MAPK path-
way [5]. In preclinical models it was shown that at least

the GNAQ mutation resulted in sensitivity to down-
stream blocking of the MAPK pathway with a MEK in-
hibitor [4]. Our data demonstrating the sensitivity of
uveal melanoma cell lines to TAK733 provides further
evidence that it may be a clinical strategy to use MEK
inhibitors to treat metastatic uveal melanomas. However,
the same issues of a lack of correlation between the in vitro
and clinical results when blocking oncogenic MAPK signal-
ing using MEK inhibitors may apply to uveal melanomas.

It
these radiolabeled metabolic
probes can provide non-invasive pharmacodynamic in-
formation with the use of clinical PET scanners. In our
studies, the highly sensitive cell lines had a decrease in
the uptake of radiolabeled thymidine and deoxy-glucose
that seemingly correlated with the cell viability and cell
cycle results. However, there were variable changes in the
highly resistant cell lines that did not directly correlate
with the cell viability assay results (ex. M263 with
marked decrease in the uptake of both tracers despite its
resistance to TAK733). The metabolic tracer uptake
studies were performed at a slightly earlier time point
than the proliferation/viability assays to capture earlier

events, and may be the reason of the discrepancy in
results. These results raise the point that earlier PET
scans with these tracers to detect early pharmacody-
namic changes may not fully predict the later restaging
imaging CT scan results.

In conclusion, inhibition of oncogenic MAPK signaling
through MEK1 and MEK2 by TAK733 results in antitu-
mor activity in vitro against a large subset of melanoma
cell lines. We confirmed the previously reported cytotoxic
effect of a MEK inhibitor against cell lines with BRAFV600E
mutations, but in addition the cytotoxic activity was evi-
dent in a high proportion of melanoma cell lines with
NRAS, GNAQ or GNA11 driver mutations. The antiproli-
ferative and cell metabolism effects of this MEK inhibitor
against melanoma cell lines can be detected with metabolic
probes that could be tested with caution in the clinical
development of this agent using PET imaging.

Material and methods
Reagents and cell lines
TAK-733 was obtained under a materials transfer agree-
ment (MTA) from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Cambridge, MA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, Fisher Scientific, Morristown, NJ) to a stock
concentration of 10 mM. The cutaneous melanoma cell
lines of the M series were established from biopsies of
metastatic melanoma of cutaneous origin as previously
described [9] under the UCLA IRB approval #02-08-067
following the Declaration of Helsinki. SKMEL28,
Wn1366 and SBCL2 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The
uveal melanoma cell
lines of the Mel20 series were
established from fine needle aspirates of primary uveal
melanoma lesions or from a metastatic uveal melanoma
lesion (Mel20-09-196), obtained under the UCLA IRB
approval #04-12-084. In the case of uveal melanoma cell
lines, cells were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine
and 4.5 g/liter glucose (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA)
containing 10% (unless noted, all percentages represent
volume to volume) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 1% penicillin, streptomycin and ampho-
tericin (Omega Scientific), with the addition of 5 μg/ml of
bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All cell lines
were mycoplasma free when periodically tested using a
Mycoalert assay (Lonza, Rockland, ME).

Oncogenic analysis of cell lines
Cell lines were analyzed for known oncogenic activating
mutations and deletions using multiplex PCR as well as
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Sequenom, San
Diego, CA) [30]. Point mutations were confirmed by
PCR and direct sequencing as previously described [9].
In addition, most cell lines were analyzed by SNP arrays
with DNA extracted from the cell lines hybridized onto

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Melanoma cell lines were treated with TAK-733 or par-
allel DMSO vehicle control at the given concentrations
for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using a tetrazo-
lium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5- (3-carboxy-
methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium (MTS)-
based colorimetric cell proliferation assay (Promega,
Madison, WI) as previously described [9].

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were treated with different concentrations of TAK-
733 (50 and 500 nM) or parallel vehicle control for 48
hours, fixed by Cytofix/Cytoperm solution and washed
by Perm/Wash buffer according to fixation and pereabi-
lization method recommended by BD bioscience, and
then stained in sterile PBS containing 1.0% albumin bo-
vine serum, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
3 μM DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Flow cyto-
metry was analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc, Asland,
OR).

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as previously described
[31]. Primary antibodies included pAkt (Ser473), pAkt
(Thr308), Akt, pS6K (Thr389), S6K, pS6 (Ser235/236),
S6, pMEK (Ser217/221), MEK, pERK1/2 (Thr204/205),
and ERK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), and α-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunoreactivity
was revealed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences
Co, Piscataway, NJ).

In vitro metabolic tracer uptake assay
3 x 104 cells/well were plated on 0.001% poly-L-lysine
(Sigma-Aldrich) pre-incubated filter bottom 96-well
plates (multiscreen HTS GV 0.22 μm opaque, Millipore,
Billerica, MA) and rested for 24 hours. 0.1 and 1 μM of
TAK733 or parallel DMSO vehicle control were added in
triplicate for 20 hours. Cells were incubated for 1 hour
with 2.0 μCi with metabolic tracers chosen as analogues
of PET tracers: 3H-DDG (American Radiolabeled Chemi-
cals Inc., St. Louis, MO) in glucose-free RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen), or methyl-3H-thymidine (thymidine, Moravek
Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA) in RPMI 1640. Extracellular
metabolic tracer was washed off using a multiscreen HTS
vacuum manifold system (Millipore). 100 μL scintillation
fluid (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was added to each well
and tritium count was measured on a 1450 microbeta trilux
microplate (Perkin Elmer).
