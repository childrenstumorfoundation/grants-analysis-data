Abstract

Skeletal abnormalities including osteoporosis and osteopenia occur frequently in both pediatric and adult neurofibroma-
tosis type 1 (NF1) patients. NF1 (Nf1) haploinsufficient osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors derived from both NF1
patients and Nf1+/2 mice exhibit increased differentiation, migration, and bone resorptive capacity in vitro, mediated by
hyperactivation of p21Ras in response to limiting concentrations of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Here, we
show that M-CSF binding to its receptor, c-Fms, results in increased c-Fms activation in Nf1+/2 osteoclast progenitors,
mediating multiple gain-in-functions through the downstream effectors Erk1/2 and p90RSK. PLX3397, a potent and selective
c-Fms inhibitor, attenuated M-CSF mediated Nf1+/2 osteoclast migration by 50%, adhesion by 70%, and pit formation by
60%. In vivo, we administered PLX3397 to Nf1+/2 osteoporotic mice induced by ovariectomy (OVX) and evaluated changes
in bone mass and skeletal architecture. We found that PLX3397 prevented bone loss in Nf1+/2-OVX mice by reducing
osteoclast differentiation and bone resorptive activity in vivo. Collectively, these results implicate the M-CSF/c-Fms signaling
axis as a critical pathway underlying the aberrant functioning of Nf1 haploinsufficient osteoclasts and may provide a
potential therapeutic target for treating NF1 associated osteoporosis and osteopenia.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common
genetic diseases with an incidence of 1 out of 3000 individuals [1].
NF1 is caused by mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene,
which encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein for
p21ras [2]. Individuals with NF1 have a high incidence of both
malignant and non-malignant complications [3,4]. Clinical studies
have reported that NF1 patients are at a significant risk for both
generalized osteoporotic abnormalities [5,6,7] and focal skeletal
abnormalities including dystrophic kyphoscoliosis and pseudar-
throsis [8,9]. NF1 patients have an increased prevalence of
osteoporosis
adolescence
[10,11,12], leading to greater risk of fracture later in life [13].
Given that osteoporosis occurs in a younger patient population
and the predisposition to pseudarthrosis is 2–5% in individuals
with NF1 [3,14,15], the ultimate health costs and sequelae of this
condition in NF1 patients may be significantly greater. Although
NF1 related osteopenia commonly presents in the childhood years,
there is no efficient treatment so far. Despite evidence of low
serum Vitamin D levels in some NF1 patients, clinical studies
involving Vitamin D supplementation have yielded conflicting

results on whether improvements in bone mineral density (BMD)
can be achieved [10,16,17].

Osteoclasts are specialized bone resorbing cells which differen-
tiate from the myeloid monocyte/macrophage lineage. Many
skeletal diseases,
in particular diseases with decreased bone
mineral density (BMD), occur as a consequence of a skeletal
imbalance that favors bone resorption. Although a significant
number of skeletal diseases, including skeletal manifestations in
NF1 patients, have been linked to abnormal osteoclast function(s)
[18,19,20,21], the intracellular mechanisms by which osteoclasts
normally function or contribute to disease states are poorly
understood.

Ras signaling pathways are highly relevant to bone formation
and the maintenance of
skeletal homeostasis. Several Ras-
activating growth factors, including M-CSF, are known to affect
skeletal development and remodeling. Mitogen-activated protein
kinase, a major downstream effector of Ras,
in the
mitogenic response to extracellular stimuli
including growth,
podosome formation, and bone resorption of the osteoclast [22].

the phenotype of Nf1

+/2

Upstream of the Ras/MAPK pathway, M-CSF binding to its
membrane receptor, c-Fms, stimulates phosphorylation of Y807
in the activation loop, resulting in a conformational shift that
enhances intrinsic kinase activity and docking of adaptor proteins
such as Grb2 and Sos with subsequent activation of the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Here we show that Nf1 haploinsuffi-
cient osteoclast progenitors exhibit increased c-Fms activation in
response to M-CSF, resulting in multiple osteoclast gain-in-
functions including migration, adhesion, and bone resorptive
capacity, which are correlated with hyperphosphorylation of the
downstream effectors Erk1/2 and p90rsk. Administration of
PLX3397, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of c-
Fms receptor tyrosine kinase activity, was sufficient to mitigate
+/2 osteoclast phenotypes in vitro. In vivo,
hyperfunctioning Nf1
+/2 mice exhibit accelerated bone loss

stress. In the present

mice vs. vehicle treated controls. Collectively,

Ethics Statement

This

study was carried out

in strict accordance Indiana
University’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). Animals and records of their ovariectomy surgery were
maintained in compliance with Indiana University’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee with approval protocol ID
#3401- A4. All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthe-
sia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

Animal and material preparation

Nf1

+/2 mice were obtained from Tyler Jacks at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) in
a C57BL/6J.129 background and backcrossed for 13 generations
into a C57BL/6J strain [23]. Studies were conducted with a
protocol approved by the Indiana University Laboratory Animal
Research Center. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated. All cytokines were purchased
from PeproTech (Rocky Hills, NC). PLX3397 was provided by
Plexxikon Inc. (Berkeley, CA).

Clonogenic progenitor assays

Colony-forming unit-macrophage/monocyte (CFU-M) of bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) was assayed, as described
previously [19]. BMMNCs were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old
+/2 mice by flushing the bone marrow and using
WT and Nf1
Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. 2.56104 BMMNCs were
seeded onto a 35-mm gridded dish containing methylcellulose
supplemented with 30 ng/mL M-CSF and 20 ng/mL murine
recombinant receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand
(RANKL) at 37uC in a 5% CO2 incubator for 7 days. Colonies
were counted using an inverted light microscope.

Generation of murine osteoclasts

Murine osteoclasts were obtained in vitro from BMMNCs, as
described previously [18]. BMMNCs were cultured in alpha
minimum essential medium (a-MEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and M-CSF 30 ng/mL and
RANKL 20 ng/mL for 3 days. Cell culture media was switched
on day 4 to a-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, M-CSF
(30 ng/mL), and RANKL (60 ng/mL) for an additional 3 days of
culture. Adherent cells were fixed and stained for tartrate resistant
acid phosphatase (TRACP) to identify osteoclasts, as described
previously [18]. Osteoclasts were visualized using a Nikon
TE2000-S microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) and images
were taken by a QImaging camera and QCapture-Pro software
+
(Fryer Company Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Multinucleated TRACP
cells containing more than three nuclei were scored as mature
+
osteoclasts. The numbers and areas of multinucleated, TRACP
osteoclasts were calculated using Image Pro Express (Media
Cybernetics, In., MD).

Migration assay

Osteoclast migration was evaluated using a transwell assay, as
described previously with minor modifications
[18]. Briefly,
equivalent numbers of pre-osteoclasts were loaded onto the upper
chamber of an 8 mm polycarbonate transwell (Corning Incorpo-
rated, Corning, NY) coated with vitronectin (Takara, Japan). The
lower chamber contained a-MEM supplemented with M-CSF
(30 ng/mL) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or PLX3397 (200 nM). Cells that
migrated to the bottom chamber were stained with crystal violet
and counted. Six fields per experimental condition were counted.

Adhesion assay

A single-cell suspension of osteoclast precursors were pipetted
into 96-well plates pre-coated with vitronectin at a density of
16104 cells/well as previously described [19]. After 30 minutes of
incubation in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/mL) with PBS
vehicle or PLX3397 (200 nM), nonattached cells were gently
removed with PBS and adherent cells were stained with crystal
violet and counted.

Bone resorption assay

Osteoclasts can form a specialized cell-extracellular matrix to
initiate degradation of bone matrix by secreting proteinases. To
directly assess the effect of PLX3397 on osteoclast bone resorption,
independent of adhesion and differentiation, pit formation assay
was performed using cells that were cultured for 3 days in media
containing M-CSF and RANKL as described previously [18].
Briefly, preosteoclasts were detached from plates after 3 days
culture in a-MEM supplemented with M-CSF (30 ng/mL) and
RANKL (20 ng/mL) and replated at 16105/well on dentine discs
(ALPCO Diagnostic, Windham, NH) in a 96-well plate. The cells
were incubated at 37uC, 5% CO2 in the presence of 30 ng/mL M-
CSF and 60 ng/mL RANKL and allowed to adhere overnight.
On the following day, vehicle (PBS) or PLX3397 (200 nM) was
added to the culture with media changed every three days. Wells
containing media alone, without M-CSF, were used as negative
controls (data not shown). Following 7 days of culture, the dentine
discs were rinsed with PBS,
immersed in 1 M ammonium
hydroxide overnight, and stained with a 1% toluidine blue in
0.5% sodium tetraborate solution. The resorptive areas or ‘‘pits’’
were imaged using reflective light microscopy. Pit area (mm2) per
low power field was quantitated using Image Pro Express software.
Six fields per experimental condition were evaluated.

High content image assay

As described above, murine preosteoclasts were obtained in vitro
+/2

from BMMNCs isolated from 6- to 8-week-old WT and Nf1
mice. After being cultured in a-MEM supplemented with M-CSF
(30 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL), preosteoclasts were starved
in 0.5%BSA in a-MEM for 6 hours, pretreated with or without
PLX3397 in serial dilution for 2 hours and then stimulated with
M-CSF (30 ng/mL) for 5 minutes. The cells were then fixed and
incubated with anti-phospho-c-Fms antibody (Cell signaling) at
1:100 for immunofluorescence staining. Thereafter, the cells were
incubated with Alexa FluorH 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)
(Invitrogen) at 1:500 and Hoechst (Invitrogen) at 1:1000 in PBS at
room temperature for 90 minutes and imaged on a BD
AttoVisionTM instrument. The mean fluorescence intensity of
phospho-c-Fms was acquired and normalized to each cell based on
the nuclear counts. Data readout was analyzed as phospho-c-Fms
mean fluorescence intensity. The half maximal inhibition concen-
tration (IC50) of PLX3397 was calculated by Prism software.

Ovariectomy surgery

To determine if application of PLX3397 prevents bone loss in
+/2-OVX mice in vivo, two groups of 8 week-old WT or Nf1
+/2

Nf1
female mice were subject to ovariectomy surgery (OVX) to induce
low bone mass as previously reported [18]. Briefly, the mice were
anesthetized via inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott
Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) mixed with O2 (1.5 liter/
minute). Ovariectomy was preceded by a 2 cm midline dorsal skin
incision. The peritoneal cavity was incised to access the ovaries,
which were then excised with scissors. The success of OVX was
verified by examining the uterine weight of the mice following
sacrifice (Figure S1A–B).

Drug administration

After two weeks of recovery from the OVX surgery, the mice
were treated with either the PBS vehicle or PLX3397 (80 mg/kg/
day) by daily gavage as recommended by the Plexxikon Inc. for a
period of twelve weeks. At the end of the treatment, the mice were
euthanized for analysis. To ensure that
these mice received
sufficient amounts of PLX3397, blood was collected in heparin
coated tubes by cardiac puncture and plasma was separated to
determine the concentration of PLX3397 in the blood (Figur-
e S1C).

Histomorphometric analysis

Utilizing our previously established methods [18,24,25], the
femurs of syngeneic experimental mice were fixed with 4%
buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) and decalcified for paraffin
embedding. Histological sections from the distal metaphysis were
stained for the osteoclast enzyme TRACP. The area of TRACP
positive (TRACP
) osteoclasts per unit trabecular surface was
counted under the microscope with a QImaging camera and
QCapture-Pro software (Version 5.1, Fryer Company Inc.,
Cincinnati, OH).

Detection of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen
(CTX) in plasma

To evaluate the impact of PLX3397 on osteoclast activity in vivo,
the CTX levels in the plasma were measured. Briefly, blood was
collected by heart puncture and transferred into ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated tubes. The tubes were immediately
placed on ice, and centrifuged within 30 minutes for plasma
separation. All samples were analyzed in the same assay. The
concentration of CTX was determined by using a commercial

Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS)
analysis of mice plasma

Plasma was collected following centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at
4uC for 20 minutes and processed for liquid chromatography/
mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) analysis. Briefly, murine plasma
samples were prepared for LC/MS analysis by precipitating
plasma with 3x volumes of ice cold acetonitrile. The precipitated
samples were centrifuged and the clarified samples were diluted
with 560.2% formic acid in water. Samples were analyzed by LC/
MS in a formic acid, water, methanol chromatography system
using an MDS SCIEX API 3000 spectrometer (Applied Biosys-
tems, Carlsbad, California).

Measurement of BMD in vivo

Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur was evaluated in vivo
using peripheral dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (pDEXA)
designed for analyzing mouse skeletons
(GE-Lunar Corp.,
Madison, USA). The mice were anesthetized via inhalation of
1.5% isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL)
mixed with O2 (1.5 liter/minute) and were placed in the prone
position on a specimen tray for scanning. For this experiment,
8 week-old female mice were scanned for BMD once before
surgery. Then, after 12 weeks of drug treatment, the mice were
scanned for BMD again before euthanasia. The BMD of the left
femoral metaphysis was measured by defining a region of interest
of 11 pixels x 10 pixels proximal to the distal growth plate, which
contains a high content of trabecular bone.

Micro (m) computed tomography (CT)

After euthanasia, bone volume and microarchitecture of the
femoral distal metaphysis were evaluated using a desktop mCT
(mCT 20; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Each
specimen was scanned with a slice increment of 9 mm starting at
15% of the total femur length measured from the tip of femoral
condyle and extending proximally for 200 slices. Microarchitec-
ture parameters including bone volume (BV, mm3) and bone
volume fraction (BV/TV, %) were measured.

Western blotting analysis

The phosphorylation levels of c-Fms, Erk1/2 and p90RSK in
preosteoclasts were determined by western blot using phospho-
specific antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Phosphorylation
levels were quantitated with Image J and standardized by total ß-
actin expression levels (Cell Signaling). Briefly, preosteoclasts were
deprived of growth factors for 12 hours in a-MEM supplemented
with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before being pretreated
with PLX3397 at different concentrations as indicated, and were
stimulated with M-CSF (30 ng/mL) for 5 minutes in the presence
of PLX3397. The cells were then lysed in ProteoJET lysis buffer
(Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) supplemented with Complete Mini
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for protein
extraction. Protein separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) were transferred to
nitrocellulose filters and probed with specific antibodies.

Statistical analyses

The data are presented as mean 6 standard error of the mean
(SEM). Differences among experimental groups were analyzed by
repeated measures of paired t-tests or analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with appropriate post hoc t-tests. P values less than

Aberrant c-Fms activation mediates M-CSF
hyperresponsiveness in Nf1 haploinsufficient osteoclast
progenitors

Although Nf1

+/2 osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors are
hyperresponsive to limiting doses of M-CSF,
the molecular
mechanisms mediating this phenotype remain unclear. We
to determine whether Nf1 haploinsufficiency
therefore sought
may result in aberrant M-CSF signaling via hyperactivation of its
receptor, c-Fms. We first examined the phosphorylation level of c-
+/2
Fms by immunofluorescence staining of WT and Nf1
+/2 preosteoclasts exhibited increased phos-
preosteoclasts. Nf1
pho-c-Fms staining both at base line and after being stimulated
with M-CSF (30 ng/mL) for 5 minutes as compared with WT
preosteoclasts. The expression levels of phospho-c-Fms decreased
markedly following treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of
the c-Fms receptor tyrosine kinase, PLX3397, at 62.5 nM and
reached the lowest level at 1 mM in WT cultures and 0.1 mM in
Nf1

+/2 cultures, respectively (Figure 1A and 1B).

c-Fms Receptor Inhibitor, Nf1, M-CSF, Osteoclast

To further validate these findings and determine the impact of
increased c-Fms activation with respect to the downstream MAPK
pathway, the phosphorylation levels of c-Fms, p90RSK, and Erk
+/2 preosteoclasts demon-
were detected by western blotting. Nf1
strated increased phosphorylation levels of c-Fms, p90RSK and
Erk as compared with WT preosteoclasts when stimulated by M-
CSF. Pretreatment of PLX3397 blocked the phosphorylation of
+/2 preosteoclasts (Figure 1C
these proteins both in WT and Nf1
and Figure S2).

+/2 osteoclast differentiation in
cologic c-Fms inhibition on Nf1
vitro. Since osteoclasts are derived from monocyte/macrophage
progeny within the bone marrow, we quantified the number of
colony forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) per femur following
culture in semisolid methylcellulose media. Consistent with our
previous data [18], a significantly increased number of CFU-M

was observed in Nf1
(BMMNCs) as compared to WT BMMNCs. Addition of
PLX3397 significantly reduced the frequencies of CFU-M at

The ability of osteoclasts to migrate across the bone surface is a
key cellular function required for bone resorption. We have
previously reported that haploinsufficiency of Nf1 resulted in
enhanced preosteoclast migration in response to M-CSF [18]. To
assess the impact of c-Fms inhibition on preosteoclast motility
mediated by M-CSF, preosteoclast migration was assessed by
transwell assays. Bottom chambers containing media alone
without M-CSF were used as negative controls (data not shown).
After four hours of stimulation, M-CSF induced a significantly

preosteoclast migration to WT levels.

To determine the impact of M-CSF/c-Fms

signaling on
preosteoclast adhesion, a key process
for initiation of bone
resorption, adhesion assays were performed. Consistent with our
+/2 preosteo-
previous findings [18], significantly increased Nf1
clasts were observed to adhere to vitronectin following M-CSF
stimulation. Pretreatment with PLX3397 (200 nM) dramatically

decreased the number of adherent cells in both WT and Nf1
preosteoclasts mediated by M-CSF (Figure 3B).

PLX3397 inhibits osteoclast bone resorption

To assess the impact of PLX3397 on osteoclast bone resorptive
activity, pit formation assays were performed [18,19]. Consistent
+/2 osteoclasts induced a 2–3 fold
with our previous study [18], Nf1
increased pit
forming area as compared to WT osteoclasts
(Figure 3C). Importantly, PLX3397 reduced pit forming areas in
+/2 cultures. These data indicate that c-Fms
both WT and Nf1
inhibition not only inhibits osteoclast differentiation but also
diminishes osteoclast bone resorptive activity.

Pharmacologic c-Fms inhibition prevents bone loss in
ovariectomized Nf1+/2 mice
Based on our findings that Nf1

+/2 osteoclasts exhibit increased
bone lytic activity and that PLX3397 inhibits osteoclast formation
and bone resorptive activity in vitro, we postulated that pharma-
cologic inhibition of c-Fms with PLX3397 may exert anti-catabolic
effects on bone in vivo. To further test our hypothesis that
PLX3397 may prevent bone loss in vivo, we gavage-fed PLX3397

Since osteoclasts are considered to be the key lineage mediating
bone loss in ovariectomy induced resorptive stress, we next
investigated the effect of ovariectomy on the number of osteoclast
progenitors in the bone marrow by performing CFU-M assays.
Ovariectomy surgery significantly increased the frequency of

Discussion

Osteoporosis and osteopenia affect both children and adults
+/2 mice have normal bone
with NF1 [5,6,7,12,26,27]. As Nf1
mass, ovariectomy is an established experimental model to induce
low bone mass in Nf1+/2 mice [18]. Previously, we reported an
+/2 bone
increased frequency of osteoclast progenitors in Nf1
marrow induced by M-CSF as assessed by the colony forming
unit-macrophage (CFU-M) assay [18]. We also showed that
haploinsufficiency of Nf1 results in hypersensitivity of osteoclast
progenitors to M-CSF correlated with hyperactivation of the Ras/
MAPK pathway [18]. In the present study, we show that the M-
CSF receptor, c-Fms, is hyperactivated in Nf1 haploinsufficient
osteoclasts and progenitors following M-CSF stimulation. Utilizing
a small molecule c-Fms kinase inhibitor, PLX3397, we demon-
+/2 osteoclast
strate that c-Fms overactivity mediates multiple Nf1
gain-in-function phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo including
expansion of osteoclast progenitors in the bone marrow, increased
osteoclast migration, adhesion, and differentiation, and accelerat-
ed bone loss following ovariectomy induced resorptive stress.

M-CSF is a critical cytokine for the development of macro-
phages and their subsequent differentiation to the osteoclast cell
lineage [28]. It has been reported recently that macrophage colony
stimulating factor (M-CSF), together with signals from a family of
biologically related tumor necrosis factor receptor like proteins

(particularly RANKL), control the induction of osteoclast differ-
entiation and are key to the physiologic and pathologic responses
of osteoclasts [29,30]. Post-menopausal patients, as well as those
with common chronic diseases such as arthritis, have a high
incidence of osteoporosis, due to increased production of M-CSF
and RANKL, which leads to increased osteoclast activation and
consequent bone loss [31]. It has been shown that PI3K is a
critical downstream effector of the M-CSF/c-Fms pathway [32].
Once activated by M-CSF, PI3K modulates osteoclast survival as
well as actin remodeling [33,34]. Pharmacologic inhibitors of
PI3K, including LY294002 and wortmannin, show a dramatic
reduction of osteoclast formation in cultures treated with M-CSF
and RANKL. Furthermore, treating osteoclasts with pharmaco-
logic inhibitors of PI3K also impairs the resorptive activity of
osteoclasts, which is associated with impaired membrane ruffling,
deficient actin ring formation, and reduced pit formation [35].
Unfortunately, the clinical utility of commercially available PI3K
inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 is limited as these
compounds
the ATP-binding site of all PI3K family
members and interfere with other PI3K related kinases at
therapeutic concentrations. As such, these inhibitors are broad
spectrum, non-specific and are associated with significant toxicity
in vivo. PLX3397 is a novel small molecule that potently and
selectively inhibits c-Fms, Kit, and Flt3-ITD kinases [36,37]. Since

exhibit hyperactivation of the c-Fms receptor kinase in response to
M-CSF, we reasoned that pharmacologic inhibition of c-Fms with
PLX3397 may exert anti-catabolic effects on bone in the NF1
murine model.

M-CSF is critical for the proliferation of osteoclast precursors
and addition of an M-CSF neutralizing antibody considerably
reduced macrophage differentiation at the early precursor stage
[38,39]. Consistent with these findings, our in vivo study indicates
that administration of PLX3397 significantly reduced the
frequency of osteoclast progenitors as shown by reduced numbers
of CFU-M. In addition, M-CSF is also essential for osteoclast
formation and maturation by contributing to proliferation and
survival
study, we show that
pharmacologic c-Fms inhibition reduces osteoclast differentiation
and bone resorption. In addition, our data demonstrates that
PLX3397 inhibited M-CSF mediated MAPK signaling pathway
by diminishing the activation of c-Fms, p90RSK and Erk, which
+/2 osteoclasts in response
are key to the hyperfunctioning of Nf1
to M-CSF.

In the present

[40].

Underscoring the critical role of c-Fms in mediating excessive
osteoclast bone resorptive activity in NF1, administration of
PLX3397 was sufficient to prevent bone loss in an established
murine model of NF1 low bone mass. This normalization of bone
mineral density and trabecular bone mass
in response to
pharmacologic c-Fms inhibition in vivo was associated with the
attenuation of osteoclast development and cellular functions,
including osteoclast differentiation, migration and bone resorption.
Collectively, these data suggest that the M-CSF signaling through
its receptor c-Fms may play a critical role in osteoclast-mediated
osteoporotic manifestations in NF1. Biochemically, our data show
that administration of PLX3397 can prevent the activation of the

MAPK signaling cascade in response to M-CSF,
correcting aberrant osteoclast functions in the Nf1
model. As such,
