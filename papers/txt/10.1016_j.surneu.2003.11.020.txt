of patients with schwannomatosis: report of six cases and review
of the literature. Surg Neurol 2004;62:353– 61.

BACKGROUND
Schwannomatosis is a rare tumor syndrome character-
ized by the presence of multiple schwannomas without
the stigmata of neuroﬁbromatosis (NF) Type 1 or 2. To
better understand the natural history and clinical man-
agement of the syndrome, a retrospective review was
conducted of patients diagnosed with schwannomatosis
over an 11-year period at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center (UPMC).
METHODS
Between 1990 and 2001, 131 patients underwent surgery
for resection of spinal or peripheral nerve schwannomas
in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center. Among the 131 patients,
there were 6 who had two or more pathologically proven
schwannomas without radiographic or clinical evidence
of vestibular schwannomas. The hospital charts, clinic
notes, radiology ﬁlms, operative reports, pathology
slides, and reports from all 6 patients were retrospec-
tively reviewed.
RESULTS
The patient population consisted of 6 patients with a
mean age of 48.7 (3 male: 3 female). All patients had
enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans that were negative for vestibular schwannomas.
Ophthalmological and general physical examinations did
not reveal any ﬁndings suggestive of NF. There was no
family history of NF or schwannomatosis. The locations
of the schwannomas included intraspinal (multiple sites),
paraspinal, brachial plexus, femoral nerve, sciatic nerve,
calf,
forearm, retroperitoneum, and middle cranial/
infratemporal
fossa region. The common presenting
symptoms included paresthesias, palpable mass, pain, or
weakness. All 6 patients underwent surgical resection of
symptomatic lesions.

CONCLUSIONS
For patients with schwannomatosis, surgery is indicated
for symptomatic lesions, while asymptomatic tumors are
followed conservatively. Because these patients are at
increased risk for developing multiple schwannomas, we
recommend regular surveillance and offer genetic coun-
seling even though the pattern of
inheritance is
unknown. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KEY WORDS
Schwannoma, peripheral nerve tumors, schwannomatosis,
neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1, neuroﬁbromatosis Type 2.

Schwannomas are benign, slowly growing, en-

capsulated peripheral nerve tumors. Most
schwannomas occur as a solitary lesion, but they
can occur as multiple lesions and can affect one or
several nerves [2– 4,10]. The presence of multiple
schwannomas in a single patient suggests a genetic
predisposition to tumorigenesis and possibly an
association with one of the several syndromes,
most commonly with neuroﬁbromatoses. Of the
several different subtypes of neuroﬁbromatosis that
have been described in the literature, only neuroﬁ-
bromatosis Type I (NF1) and Type II (NF2) have
recognized National Institute of Health (NIH) con-
sensus guidelines for diagnosis [15,16]. NF1 is by far
the most common of the neuroﬁbromatoses, with
an estimated incidence of 1/2500 at birth, represent-
ing ⬎90% of neuroﬁbromatosis patients [9,16,18].
The NF1 gene has been localized to chromosome
17q11.1 with its product neuroﬁbromin regulating
ras oncoproteins [8,24]. NF2 is much less common
than NF1, occurring in approximately 1/33,000
births and is associated with a signiﬁcantly higher
morbidity and mortality because of the higher inci-
dence of intracranial and spinal tumors [14 –16].
Mutations on chromosome 22q12 in NF2 cause in-
activation of the tumor suppressor merlin, and

leads to the generation of multiple neural tumors
[19,23]. The diagnostic hallmark of NF2 is the pres-
ence of bilateral eighth cranial nerve schwannomas,
which occur in almost 95% of NF2 patients [14].
Patients with NF2 also have increased incidence of
single and multiple meningiomas as well as multiple
peripheral schwannomas [1,5].

Recently, several reports have pointed to the ex-
istence of a small subset of patients with multiple
schwannomas without any radiologic or clinical
evidence of vestibular nerve schwannomas or any
other stigmata associated with NF2 [13,17,20,21,
25,26]. Molecular and genetic analysis of these pa-
tients’ tumors suggests that schwannomatosis may
be a distinct genetic and clinical syndrome
[11,13,20]. Our experience in the Department of
Neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center (UPMC) supports the existence of
schwannomatosis as a distinct clinical entity. In this
report we present our 11-year experience with
treatment of patients with multiple schwannomas
without clinical or radiologic evidence of NF2.

Materials and Methods
Between 1990 and 2001, 131 patients underwent
operation for spinal and peripheral nerve schwan-
nomas at the Department of Neurosurgery, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania Medical Center. Among the 131
patients, there were 6 who had two or more patho-
logically proven schwannomas. Magnetic reso-
nance images (MRI) of the head with and without
gadolinium contrast were obtained in all 6 patients
and revealed no evidence of vestibular schwanno-
mas.
In addition, ophthalmological and general
physical examinations did not reveal any ﬁndings
suggestive of NF. There was no family history of NF
or schwannomatosis in any of the 6 patients. The
hospital charts, clinic notes, operative reports, and
pathology slides from all 6 patients were retrospec-
tively reviewed. All patients underwent surgery for
symptomatic lesions by a single neurosurgeon
(ELZ).

Results
Among the 131 patients with spinal or peripheral
nerve schwannomas treated during an 11-year pe-
riod, we identiﬁed 6 patients with schwannomatosis
(4.6%). Table 1 provides an overview of the charac-
teristics of 6 patients. At presentation, the patients
had a mean age of 48.7 years (range, 17–79 years).
The average follow-up was 6.4 years (range, 3.5–11
years). There was no family history of NF or schw-

annomatosis. The locations of the schwannomas
included intraspinal (multiple sites), paraspinal,
brachial plexus, femoral nerve, sciatic nerve, calf,
forearm, retroperitoneum, and middle cranial/
infratemporal fossa region. The common present-
ing symptoms included paresthesias, pain, weak-
ness, or palpable mass (Table 1).

All 6 patients underwent surgical resection for
their symptomatic lesions. Preoperatively, all tu-
mors were imaged with MRI. Intraoperative neuro-
physiological monitoring was used in all operative
cases. At the end of the follow-up period, all pa-
tients were in good clinical condition.

This 28-year-old male presented with paresthesias
and pain radiating from his left hip to the knee. He

had no associated bowel or bladder dysfunction.
On physical examination he had weakness and at-
rophy of the left gastrocnemius muscle. An electro-
myogram (EMG) study revealed multiple radiculop-
athies. MRI showed an enhancing intradural,

reported feeling a “popping” sensation in her left
forearm and was recasted on suspicion of recurrent
fracture. Persistent pain prompted an MRI 1 year
later, which revealed a nerve sheath tumor between
distal ulna and radius. The tumor was resected
along with the involved distal posterior interosse-
ous nerve, with no neurologic deﬁcit postopera-
tively. No pathology report is available for this pro-
cedure. Within 1 year after surgery, the patient
noticed recurrence of pain in her forearm as well as
pain in her neck and proximal upper extremities.
The patient was referred to UPMC for further man-
agement. Repeat MRI revealed multiple small en-
hancing lesions in the forearm (Figure 5), but EMG
examination was normal. Physical examination re-
vealed a single CAL, tenderness over the left distal
forearm, and a ﬁrm fullness that appeared to cor-
respond to the location of the largest lesion seen on
MRI. There was notable atrophy of the left hypothe-
nar eminence with weak extension, abduction and
adduction of the fourth and ﬁfth digits. In 1999, the
patient underwent surgical resection of 3 nerve
sheath tumors from the left distal forearm, with
ﬁnal diagnosis of schwannoma (Figure 4B). The pa-
tient has no family history of NF1 or NF2, no Lisch
nodules, negative MRI spine and head, and a genetic
test negative for NF1.

PATIENT 3
This 44-year-old male presented with paresthesias
of the right arm, and a palpable mass in the right
supraclavicular fossa was found. Subsequent bi-
opsy at a local hospital conﬁrmed the diagnosis of
schwannoma. He developed neuropathic pain of the
right arm after the biopsy and was followed with
periodic MRI. His pain was controlled with Tegretol.
In October of 1999, the patient developed right knee
numbness and pain that progressed with time. In
addition, he had pain originating in the posterior
thigh radiating to the buttock. He was seen by his
orthopedist who obtained an MRI of the lumbar
spine, which revealed two large intraspinal tumor
masses (Figure 6) and a mass in the right psoas
muscle consistent with nerve sheath tumors. Addi-
tional studies revealed a lesion in the tongue, right
femoral nerve, right sciatic nerve and three lesions
in the left calf. MRI of the brain was negative for any
intracranial
lesion. The patient was referred to
UPMC for management. On physical examination, it
was noted that the patient had a single large CAL on
the medial aspect of his left thigh. The patient has
no family history of neuroﬁbromatosis. In Novem-
ber 1999 he underwent a lumbar laminectomy with
resection of the intraspinal masses at UPMC. Pa-
thology conﬁrmed the diagnosis of schwannoma

extramedullary mass at the T12 level with compres-
sion of the conus and proximal cauda equina as well
as smaller lesions in the neural foramina of T5 and
T11 and small asymptomatic enhancing lesions at
multiple levels (Figure 1). The patient underwent a
T12 laminectomy with complete resection of the
tumor in December 1990 (Figure 2) with diagnosis
of schwannoma. In August 1991, he underwent T5
hemilaminectomy with tumor removal. Eight years
later, the patient began experiencing pain in the
right ﬂank and hip when sitting. Repeat MRI showed
signiﬁcant progression of the lesion at the L1 level
with compression of the thecal sac (Figure 3). The
patient underwent an L1 laminectomy with com-
plete resection of the tumor, with the ﬁnal diagnosis
of schwannoma (Figure 4A). Patient had no Lisch
nodules, CAL, axillary freckling, or history of any
other neural tumors. There was no family history of
NF1 or NF2. In October 1999, a brain MRI with and
without contrast was negative for any intracranial
mass. His small asymptomatic lesions at L3 are
being followed with yearly MRI studies.
PATIENT 2
This 17-year-old female initially presented at age 11
with numbness and tingling of the extensor aspect
of her left forearm as well as bilateral paresthesias
in her upper extremities. EMG was consistent with
carpal tunnel syndrome, and she underwent bilat-
eral carpal tunnel release at a local hospital with
only minimal relief of symptoms. Approximately 9
months after surgery, the patient fractured her left
distal forearm and was treated with casting. Follow-
ing the fracture, she continued to have pain in her
left hand and forearm. Three years later, the patient

Discussion

This paper describes our experience treating pa-
tients with multiple schwannomas without evi-
dence of vestibular schwannomas. Tumors were

traced back to the early 1980s. Shishiba et al re-
ported 33 patients with “neurilemomatosis,” or mul-
tiple schwannomas [22]. A number of case reports
followed, documenting at least 30 additional cases
of multiple schwannomas, including patients with
multiple tumors on the same peripheral nerve or in
the same body segment [2,3,17,21]. In 1988, the NIH
consensus guidelines included bilateral acoustic
neuromas in the diagnostic criteria for NF2 [16].
Nearly 45% of Shishibi’s original patients were then
reclassiﬁed as NF2 patients. Evans et al argued that
the remainder of these original patients and many
in other case studies included those who were too
young to have the diagnosis of NF2 excluded, as the
mean age for development of acoustic neuromas in
NF2 is 20 to 22 years of age [6]. Instead of a separate
entity, Evans suggested that schwannomatosis was
a subcategory of NF2 [6].

MacCollins et al studied 14 patients with multiple
schwannomas without the clinical or radiologic cri-
teria for NF1 or NF2 [13]. They reported that
schwannomatosis did not follow the normal pattern
of autosomal dominant inheritance seen in NF2.
Only 1 out of the 14 patients had a positive family
history for NF2. Antinheimo et al had similar results
when they analyzed the Finnish Cancer Registry for
cases of multiple schwannomas [1]. While 2% (11 of
455) of schwannoma patients had multiple schwan-
nomas without NF2, only 2 of these 11 had familial
schwannomatosis [1].

Jacoby et al analyzed the DNA of tumors and

found in all regions of the body, including spinal,
peripheral nerve, or subcutaneous regions. Patients
commonly presented with a palpable mass, pain,
and paresthesias as well as weakness and atrophy.
In all 6 patients, symptomatic tumors were treated
with surgery and asymptomatic tumors were ob-
served for further growth. MRI was used to rule out
the presence of asymptomatic vestibular schwan-
nomas, which would suggest the diagnosis of NF2.
While 2 of the 6 patients did exhibit 1 CAL, no
patients had any ocular ﬁndings or other stigmata
of NF. None of the patients had a family history of
NF or schwannomatosis.

The earliest reports of schwannomatosis may be

implying that

blood samples from 20 patients with schwannoma-
tosis, including the patients reported in MacCollins’
study [11]. Tumors from these patients frequently
had the same truncating mutations and loss of
heterozygosity at the Nf2 locus as NF2 patients.
However, normal tissue did not contain these
changes,
the underlying genetic
mechanism of NF2 and schwannomatosis differs.
Some of the patients in this study were found to
be somatic mosaics, including 1 patient who had
multiple schwannomas in a single limb. In 4 patients
they found that individual tumors had unique mu-
tations in the same allele. It is likely that there
are several genetic mechanisms at play in the gen-
eration of multiple schwannomas. Further studies
are needed to clarify the genetic basis for
schwannomatosis.

Currently, there is no NIH diagnostic criteria for
schwannomatosis. In 1997, Jacoby et al proposed a
deﬁnition that has been widely adopted in the lit-
erature [11]. By this deﬁnition, patients can be de-
ﬁnitively diagnosed with schwannomatosis if they
have had two or more pathologically proven
schwannomas and without radiographic evidence
of a vestibular nerve tumor at age greater than 18.
If a radiographic test such as MRI of the brain is
not available, then a probable or presumptive diag-
nosis may be made if the patient has two or more
pathologically proven schwannomas and no clinical
symptoms of eighth nerve dysfunction at age
greater than 30 or two or more schwannomas in an
anatomically limited distribution without clinical
ﬁnding of eighth nerve dysfunction at any age.

Patients with schwannomatosis represent a very
small fraction of patients with spinal or peripheral
schwannomas who are managed neurosurgically.
Seppa¨la¨ et al reported a series of 243 patients with
spinal schwannomas over a 40-year period and
identiﬁed 9 patients (3.7%) with schwannomatosis
[20]. The incidence is similar to the 4.6% in our
current 11-year experience of 131 patients with
schwannomas. These patients commonly undergo
multiple operative procedures over the course of
their lifetime. Most of the patients were middle-
aged at presentation with a mean age in our series
of 48.7, which is similar to the mean age of 43.5
reported by Seppa¨la¨ et al [20]. In contrast, patients
with NF2 tend to become symptomatic at a much
younger age, with a reported mean age of 21.5 in a
large clinical series [5].

Most symptomatic schwannomas can be re-
moved safely surgically by surgeons with experi-
ence resecting nerve sheath tumors [4,7,12]. We
recommend the use of intraoperative neurophysio-
logical monitoring for all cases. Asymptomatic tu-

mors can be monitored conservatively with serial
MRI studies, usually at a yearly interval. In addition,
patients are educated about their condition so that
they can recognize the early signs and symptoms of
a symptomatic schwannoma. If there is any clinical
indication for pathologic diagnosis, such as ruling
out malignancy, computed tomography-guided bi-
opsy may be utilized. However, the outcome for
surgical resection following initial biopsy are re-
portedly worse than the outcome in cases with no
prior biopsy, presumably because of biopsy in-
duced ﬁbrosis and/or nerve injury [7,12].

For long-term management of these patients, it is
important to consider genetic testing. Currently ge-
netic testing has limited clinical use because it has
little impact on surgical decision making. However,
a molecular diagnosis of NF2 rules out the diagnosis
of schwannomatosis and makes genetic counseling
more straightforward. Because the exact genetic
mechanisms underlying schwannomatosis have not
been fully identiﬁed, patients should be informed of
the possibility of germ-line mutations, particularly
in light of rare reports of a familial incidence.

Conclusions
Schwannomatosis is a rare tumor syndrome char-
acterized by the presence of multiple schwannomas
without the stigmata of neuroﬁbromatosis (NF)
Type 1 or 2. We reviewed our experience of man-
aging 6 patients with schwannomatosis during an
11-year period: for patients with schwannomatosis,
surgery is indicated for symptomatic lesions, while
asymptomatic tumors are followed conservatively.
Patients are counseled to monitor themselves for
any new onset of neurologic symptoms. Because
these patients are at increased risk for developing
multiple schwannomas, we recommend regular sur-
veillance and offer genetic counseling.

COMMENTARY
These authors from the University of Pennsylvania
very thoroughly describe 6 patients with multiple
schwannomas, and yet, without vestibular schwan-
nomas. Their review of the literature regarding this
interesting subtype of neural sheath tumors is ex-
cellent, and the histiology presented is especially
ﬁne. I would agree with their management paradigm
of surgical removal of the symptomatic lesions or
those threatening dysfunction followed by counsel-
ing including genetic advice.
