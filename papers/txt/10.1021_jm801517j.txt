Griseofulvin was identiﬁed as an inhibitor of centrosomal clustering in a recently developed assay.
Centrosomal clustering is an important cellular event that enables bipolar mitosis for cancer cell lines harboring
supernumerary centrosomes. We report herein the synthesis and SAR of 34 griseofulvin analogues as inhibitors
of centrosomal clustering. The variations in the griseofulvin structure cover ﬁve positions, namely the 4, 5,
2′, 3′, and 4′ positions. Modiﬁcation of the 4 and 5 positions affords inactive molecules. The enol ether
must be at the 2′ position, and the 4′ position needs to be sp2 hybridized. The most active analogues were
the 2′-benzyloxy and 2′-(4-methylbenzyloxy) analogues as well as the oxime of the former with a 25-fold
increase of activity compared to griseofulvin. Comparison of the results obtained in this work with prior
reported growth inhibition data for dermatophytic fungi showed both similarities and differences.

Introduction

Griseofulvin (1, Figure 1) is a classic antifungal agent1,2 used
clinically for the treatment of dermatomycoses. Since the
isolation of griseofulvin in 1939,3 it has attracted a lot of
attention and more than a hundred papers describing analogue
synthesis as well as structure-activity relationship (SARa)
studies relating to antifungal activity have been published. Since
1950, more than 400 analogues have been disclosed covering
most positions and many have displayed signiﬁcantly increased
activity in published antifungal assays. More recently, griseof-
ulvin has been the object of increased interest due to its activity
toward a range of mammalian cancer cell lines.4 Griseofulvin
has been shown to be cytotoxic by itself but also to potentiate
the activity of another anticancer drug, nocodazole.5,6 The
cytotoxicity of three 2′ analogues in Chinese hamster V79 cells
has previously been reported by Oda.7

We have recently developed an assay8 to identify small
molecules that inhibit centrosomal clustering, a mechanism
necessary for successful bipolar mitoses in human cancer cell
lines with supernumerary centrosomes.9,10 Healthy mammalian
cells harbor two centrosomes during mitosis that function as
mitotic spindle poles to ensure accurate chromosome segrega-
tion, whereas the majority of human malignancies contain
multiple centrosomes. Supernumerary centrosomes can form
multipolar spindles leading to aberrant mitoses with consecutive
chromosome missegregation, eventually resulting in apoptosis.
In most human cancer cell lines, this spindle multipolarity is
overcome through centrosomal clustering, giving rise to two

functional spindle poles and thereby allowing for successful
mitosis.11 As this phenotype is speciﬁc to cancer cells, there is
a possibility that the compounds identiﬁed in our assay will
target cancer cells selectively without interfering with healthy
cells.

Microtubules are vital components of centrosomes, and
compounds interacting with the dynamics of tubulin polymer-
ization and depolymerization are a major category of anticancer
agents including vinca alkaloids and taxanes.12 Griseofulvin is
known to interact with tubulin,13 but the mode of action for
this inhibition is not fully understood although a few theories
have been proposed.4,5,14

We have tested 34 griseofulvin analogues in our assay, of
which nine are novel, affording the ﬁrst SAR study of this
compound class with regard to anticancer activity. The analogues
vary at ﬁve positions of the griseofulvin structure, namely the
4, 5, 2′, 3′, and 4′ positions. All analogues described in this
paper have been prepared from commercially available griseof-
ulvin in one to four synthetic steps.

could be reduced to the amine 8 with iron powder.17 Reductive
amination with benzaldehyde yielded analogue 9 (Scheme 1).

compounds 10-15 plus their 4′ enol ether isomers. Dioxane
was used as cosolvent for alcohols with higher boiling points,
leading to 16 and 17. This method was generally applicable to
the synthesis of analogues with straight chain vinyl ethers in
yields of 14-22% (Scheme 2).

Bulkier alcohols like benzyl alcohol and cyclopentanol led
to unsatisfactory yields of 2-4%. An attractive alternative was
the known19 route through the 2′ vinyl chloride 18, which relies
on a base mediated addition of the alcohol followed by
elimination of chloride (Scheme 3). Vinyl chloride 18 is
accessible by treatment of 2 with lithium chloride in phosphoryl
chloride. We found using dioxane as cosolvent convenient
because this allowed us to reduce the amount of phosphoryl
chloride to 5 equiv, greatly facilitating the workup procedure
and the scale-up to multigram amounts.

The addition of alcohols to 18 performed well in DMF, THF,
and dioxane with comparable yields and THF or dioxane was
used as solvent for all subsequent experiments. NaH and Cs2CO3

dure.21 The oximes 28 and 29 were derived from the parent
ketones by treatment with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in
ethanol and DMSO, a slight modiﬁcation of the method of
Delgado et al.17 and isolated as inseparable 1:1 mixtures of
geometrical isomers. In a similar fashion, the hydrazine 30 was
synthesized by heating 1 with N,N-dimethyl hydrazine and acetic
acid in toluene. The major product was the E analogue 30 with
the geometry distinguished by NOE in proton NMR. The H3′
proton of the two isomers showed two distinct signals in NMR.
No dipolar coupling between a hydrazine methyl group and H3′
could be observed for the pure analogue 30, but a strong NOE
was detected for the isomer.

3′,3′-Dimethyl griseofulvic acid (31) was derived from 2
treated with K2CO3 and MeI22 (Scheme 5). Analogue 32 was
synthesized from 2 by reaction with benzyl bromide, NaI, and
KOH.22 Treatment of 1 with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and
triethylsilyl triﬂate (TESOTf) afforded 33, and the 3′-iodo
analogues 34 and 35 were obtained using the same convenient
conditions. This type of compounds have previously been
prepared by treating 2 with iodine monochloride and 2 equiv
of KOAc,23 followed by reacting the intermediate with an excess
of an appropriate diazo alkane.24

Results and Discussion

Compounds 1-35 were evaluated for their ability to inhibit
centrosomal clustering in our cellular assay8 (Table 1). The
percentages of cells with multipolar spindles were measured in
triplicate at 14 different concentrations (100 µM to 12 nM),
and IC50 values were calculated with an IC50 of 24 µM for
griseofulvin (1). Analogues with IC50 values higher than 100
µM are regarded as inactive.

At ring A, the 4 and 5 positions were altered. Elongation at
the 4 position resulted in no activity for either the ethyl (5) or
benzyl (6) ethers. Introduction of a nitro (7), amine (8), or benzyl
amine (9) group at the 5 position negates all activity, indicating
that bulkier groups at these two positions are not tolerated.
Compound 6 has previously been tested for growth inhibition
against dermatophytes (Epidermophyton ﬂoccosum, Trichophy-
ton interdigitale, T. persicolor, T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum,
and Microsporum canis), and 7 and 8 have been tested against
the latter three in addition to T. terrestre and all three were
found to be less active than 1.17,25

The 2′, 3′, and 4′ positions of the C ring have been altered in
this study. Solvolysis of 2 with a given alcohol affords two
isomers with the enol ether positioned at either the 2′ or 4′
position. We have tested altogether 11 analogues with a 4′ enol
ether as in isogriseofulvin (3), including the isomers of 10-17
and 20, and all have been inactive (data not shown). This
strongly indicates that active analogues should have the enol
ether at the 2′ position. The activity of the 4′ enol ether isomers
of 3, 10, 13, and 19 toward a range of dermatophytes
(Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. interdigitale, T. rubrum, T.
persicolor, Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton ﬂoccosum)
have been published and all showed lower activity than 1.25
Several analogues with modiﬁcations at the 2′ position have
been prepared, and elongation of the methoxy group in 1
(analogues 10-15) increases the activity, with a maximum
around 4 carbon atoms.

The activity can be further increased by the introduction of
bulkier groups. The cyclopropylmethoxy (16) and cyclopentoxy
(17) analogues have IC50 values of 1.8 and 1.3 µM, comparable
to the phenoxy (19) and benzylthio (21) analogues with 1.5 and
1.3 µM. The most active 2′ analogues are the benzyloxy (20)
and 4-methylbenzyloxy (23) compounds, both with an IC50 value
of 0.9 µM. While there is little difference between 19 and 20,
the phenylethoxy analogue 22 is signiﬁcantly less potent with
an IC50 value of 15 µM. The introduction of even bulkier groups
such as 4-biphenylmethoxy (24) and adamantylmethoxy (25)
affords IC50 values of 2.9 and 3.7 µM, higher than the most
active compounds but signiﬁcantly more potent than 1. Because
our assay is whole-cell based, transport over the cell membrane
potentially also inﬂuences the observed activity. The higher
lipophilicity of 24 and 25 could render this transport easier,
which would contribute to the observed increase in activity.

Growth inhibition data for the dermatophytes Trichophyton
mentagrophytes, T. interdigitale, T. rubrum, T. persicolor,
Microsporum canis, and Epidermophyton ﬂoccosum has been
published for compounds 10, 11, 13, 15, 19, and 20.25 The
activities for 10 and 11 were equal to or lower than 1, while 13
was more active against
interdigitale, T.
persicolor) and similar or less toward the remaining strains.
Compound 15 showed increased activity against a single strain
(T. interdigitale), and 19 and 20 were inactive.

two strains (T.

A different phenotype was seen for 18. Usually, cells are
attached to the dish by focal adhesions. Treatment with 18 led
to a detachment of the cell monolayer from the dish, but,
interestingly, the cell-cell contacts were not affected. Because
of this phenotype, induction of multipolar spindle formation
could not be analyzed.

The 4′ alcohol, griseofulvol (26), has no activity and neither
has the 2′-methoxy 4′-alcohol analogue (27). The 4′ position
of 1 was altered to an oxime (28), giving rise to an increase in
activity with an IC50 of 17 µM. To check for a possible
synergistic effect, the 2′ benzyloxy analogue 20 was also ﬁtted
with an oxime affording 29, but the activity did not exceed that
of 20 as the IC50 value remained at 0.9 µM. Introduction of a
hydrazine group at the 4′ position (30) led to a slight decrease
in activity with an IC50 of 27 µM. No activity was reported for
26 toward dermatophytes Trichophyton metagrophytes or T.
rubrum, but for 28, the activity toward those two strains and T.
terrestre and Microsporum canis was comparable to griseof-
ulvin.17

The results from the 4′ analogues indicate that this position
is important for the activity, as removal of the ketone renders
the compounds (26 and 27) inactive. Taken together with the
increase in activity for 28 and 29, it suggests that the 4′ position
should be sp2 hybridized.

Neither griseofulvic acid 2, the 3′,3′-dimethyl analogue 31,
nor 3′-benzyl griseofulvic acid (32) showed activity in our assay.
Introduction of iodine at the 3′ position had equivocal effects.
3′-Iodo griseofulvin (33) and 3′-iodo-2′-benzyloxy analogue 35
were inactive. For the 2′-propoxy-3′-iodo analogue 34, the IC50
found was 2.0 µM, only a factor two higher than the most active
compounds and lower than the 2′-propoxy analogue 11 itself.
In antifungal screens, 33 shows lower activity toward Tricho-
phyton mentagrophytes, T. interdigitale, T. rubrum, T. persi-
color, Microsporum canis, and Epidermophyton ﬂoccosum,

where 34 has a lower activity against all save T. interdigitale,
where the activity is the same as 1.25

the antifungal activity of griseofulvin analogues does not
correlate directly to their activity in mammalian cells.

Conclusion

Experimental Section

We report here for the ﬁrst time a collection of griseofulvin
analogues tested for inhibition of centrosomal clustering in
cancer cells. Of the 34 analogues tested, 13 were inactive, two
had decreased activity, and 18 displayed increased activity as
compared to griseofulvin, while one analogue showed a different
phenotype characterized by detachment of the cell monolayer
from the dish.

All modiﬁcations of the 4 and 5 positions resulted in no
activity, and thus these positions should not be altered. It appears
as if the 4′ position needs to be sp2 hybridized as reduction of
the ketone results in no activity, whereas introduction of either
an oxime (28 and 29) or a hydrazine (30) group leads to more
active analogues. A total of 11 4′ enol ether analogues have
been tested, and all were inactive. The two inactive analogues
31 and 32 also indicate that modiﬁcations must preserve the
conjugated system of 1 to be beneﬁcial.

The 2′ position has been explored the most, and elongation
at this position increases the activity while introducing bulkier
groups do so to an even larger extent. The optimal substituent
seems to be a benzyloxy group (20) with the possibility of
substitution on the aromatic ring. The phenylethoxy analogue
22 is 15 times less active than 20, and a longer tether is thus
not a viable option for increased activity.

The three iodo substituted analogues do not give a clear
picture of the effect of substitution at the 3′ position as the
activity varies. We speculate that
the iodine changes the
conformation of the 2′ substituent and that the benzyloxy group
is shifted to a less desirable position, whereas the propyloxy
group is moved to a more favorable position.

While comparing the SAR data obtained in this work for
inhibition of centrosomal clustering with the growth inhibitory
effect against seven dermatophytic fungi, some similarities are
seen but also notable differences. Modiﬁcation of the 4 and 5
positions in the A ring renders the analogues inactive with regard
to both activities. For the C ring modiﬁcations, the 4′ enol ether
analogues displayed reduced or no activity in both types of
assay. When modifying the 2′ position, the activity toward
dermatophytes is retained for the ethyl and propyl analogues.
The butyl and hexyl analogues show increased activity toward
some fungal strains and lower toward others. The inhibition of
centrosomal clustering is increased for all straight chained 2′
analogues, compared to griseofulvin. With bulkier substituents
(19 and 20), lower activity is seen toward all dermatophyte
strains, while the inhibition of centrosomal clustering is
enhanced further.

Reduction of the 4′ ketone makes the analogue inactive both
toward dermatophytes and cancer. An oxime on the 4′ position
retains activity toward dermatophytes but increases the cen-
trosomal clustering inhibition. Compound 33 with substitution
in the 3′ position is less active in our assay as well as against
dermatophytes, while 34 has diminished antifungal activity but
is 12 times more potent than 1 in our assay.

The results described herein demonstrate that the activity of
griseofulvin as an inhibitor of centrosomal clustering can be
enhanced by structural modiﬁcations, which renders this com-
pound class interesting as potential anticancer agents. Further-
more, we have demonstrated that previously published data on

Starting materials, reagents, and solvents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further puriﬁcation.
Reactions involving air or moisture sensitive reagents were carried
out under N2, and ﬂasks were dried by ﬂame heating under reduced
pressure. DMF, CH2Cl2, dioxane, and toluene were dried over 3 Å
molecular sieves. Evaporation of solvents was done under reduced
pressure (in vacuo). Purity of all compounds was found to be greater
than 95% by LC-DAD-MS (see below).

NMR spectra were recorded using either a Varian Unity Inova
500 MHz spectrometer or a Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer.
13C NMR spectra were recorded using either a Bruker AC 200 MHz
or a Varian Mercury 300 MHz. Chemical shifts were measured in
ppm and coupling constants in Hz, the ﬁeld is indicated in each
case. When CDCl3 was used as solvent, the residual peak was used
as internal reference at δ 7.27 for 1H NMR and δ 77.00 for 13C
NMR spectra. When DMSO-d6 was used, the values were δ 2.50
for 1H NMR and δ 39.43 for 13C NMR spectra.

IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer 1600 series FTIR.
All melting points are uncorrected. TLC was performed on
aluminum sheets precoated with silica gel 60 F254 (Merck
1.05554.0001). Compounds were visualized by charring after
dipping in a solution of 1% KMnO4, 6.7% K2CO3, and 0.08%
NaOH in water. UV visualization was done using a model UVGL-
25 Mineralight lamp.

EIMS were recorded by direct inlet to a GCMS-QP5000 gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer from Shimadzu. High-resolution
LC-DAD-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 system equipped
with a photodiode array detector (DAD) and coupled to a LCT
orthogonal time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass)
with a Z-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source and a LockSpray
probe (M + H 556.2771) and controlled by MassLynx 4.0 software.
LC-MS calibration from m/z 100-900 was done with a PEG
mixture. Standard separation involved a LUNA 2 column with an
acetonitrile (50 ppm TFA) in water gradient starting from 15% to
100% over 25 min with a ﬂow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Microanalyses
were obtained from H. Kolbe, Mikroanalytisches Laboratorium,
Mu¨lheim/Ruhr, Germany.

For the determination of IC50 values, we tested the compounds
in our assay8 for centrosomal clustering based on SSC114 cells,
an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line characteristic for this
phenotype. Despite the presence of supernumerary centrosomes in
64.5% of SCC114 cells, only 3.6% of the cells in mitosis harbor
multipolar spindles. The rest of the cell population cluster their
centrosomes and undergo bipolar mitoses, making this cell line an
ideal model system. SCC114 cells were grown in 96-well plates to
near conﬂuence and treated for 24 h with different griseofulvin
analogues. The compounds were tested in triplicate at 14 different
concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.3, 3.1, 2, 1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05,
0.02, and 0.01 µM). Cells were then ﬁxed and examined by
ﬂuorescence microscopy. Then 100 mitotic cells per well were
analyzed, with the percentage of mitotic cells with multipolar
spindles being the read-out. The relationship between readout and
the dose was described by a logistic model (eq 1):

p ) (1 + exp(-R - (cid:2)x))-1

(1)

where p is the percentage of mitotic cells with multipolar spindles
and x is the dose scaled according to x ) ln(dose + 1). The dose
axis was scaled to spread out the low concentration data. The IC50
values and the corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals were
determined from the ﬁtted dose-response curves. The calculations
were performed in Matlab 7.0.4.365 (The Mathworks) using the
glmﬁt and glmVal functions.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Enol Ethers by
Addition-Elimination (19-25). To a solution of 18 (0.65 mmol,
1 equiv) in 1,4-dioxane (3 mL, 0.2 M) was added the desired alcohol
(1.30 mmol, 2 equiv) and DBU (1.63 mmol, 2.5 equiv). The mixture
was heated to 100 °C and stirred for 12 h. The mixture was then
cooled to 20 °C, and excess reagent was quenched with sat. aq
NH4Cl (30 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (3
× 30 mL) and the combined organic phases were dried (MgSO4)
and then concentrated. The residue was puriﬁed by column
chromatography (heptane:EtOAc 3:2) affording the product. When
possible the product was recrystallized from EtOAc/heptane.
