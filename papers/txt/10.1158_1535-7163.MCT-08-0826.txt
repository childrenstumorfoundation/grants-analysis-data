Abstract
In developing inhibitors of the LIM kinases, the initial lead
molecules combined potent target inhibition with potent
cytotoxic activity. However, as subsequent compounds
were evaluated, the cytotoxic activity separated from
inhibition of LIM kinases. A rapid determination of the
cytotoxic mechanism and its molecular target was enabled
by integrating data from two robust core technologies. High-
content assays and gene expression profiling both indicated
an effect on microtubule stability. Although the cytotoxic
compounds are still kinase inhibitors, and their structures did
not predict tubulin as an obvious target, these results
provided the impetus to test their effects on microtubule
polymerization directly. Unexpectedly, we confirmed tubulin
itself as a molecular target of the cytotoxic kinase inhibitor
compounds. This general approach to mechanism of action
questions could be extended to larger data sets of quantified
phenotypic and gene expression data. [Mol Cancer Ther

Introduction
Protein kinase inhibitors represent an increasing class of
cancer therapeutics. The approval of the BCR-ABL inhibitor
imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia showed that an
acceptable level of target specificity was achievable, and
eight protein kinase inhibitors are now approved therapies
for a variety of cancers (1). It is recognized that each drug has
multiple activities; in some cases, this has been used to
expand their indications. For example, imatinib has activities

beyond BCR-ABL inhibition that allow efficacy in gastroin-
testinal stromal tumors (2). Studies of inhibitor specificity
typically examine cross-reactivity against other protein
kinases (3) or low-potency effects against target panels
involved in liabilities (4). However, recent publications
illustrate that kinase inhibitors are also capable of potent
interactions that affect the function of additional protein
classes (5– 8). For example, an inhibitory activity of imatinib
and nilotinib on the oxidoreductase enzyme Nqo2 has been
shown; this activity is not shared with dasatinib (5, 7), a third
kinase inhibitor approved in chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Clearly, it is preferable to characterize such off-target
activities before approval of a therapeutic compound.
However, identifying any additional molecular targets for a
compound de novo remains challenging, especially in cases
where small structural changes between compounds lead to
large changes in activity (the ‘‘activity cliff’’; ref. 9).
Mechanism of action projects have a high risk of failure and
are associated with unpredictable timelines and specialized
methods. Thus, compounds with unknown primary targets
(or with evidence of an additional activity beyond a known
primary target as in this case) are disfavored for development
as drugs. Core technology platforms represent a new and
attractive approach to molecular target identification. Studies
can usually be initiated without a specific hypothesis or
dedicated resources. For example, expression profiling
(10– 12) or high-content phenotypic assays (13, 14) have been
used in recent reports of successful target identification.

We identified a series of potent inhibitors of the LIM
kinases (LIMK). LIMK1 and LIMK2 regulate the actin
cytoskeleton by phosphorylating and inactivating the cofilin
family of actin-depolymerizing factors (15, 16); LIMK1 also
acts to destabilize microtubules (17) and regulates cell mo-
tility, including tumor metastasis (18). The potent cytotoxic
activity of early compounds seemed to validate LIMKs as
oncology targets. However, later compounds in the same
series showed that cytotoxicity was distinct from LIMK inhi-
bition. Given the possible utility in oncology, the identity of
the additional cytotoxic target was of immediate interest.
Additional targets for kinase inhibitors are often assumed
to be other protein kinases. In this case, we used a standard
panel of high-content assays for apoptosis, combined with
gene expression profiling, to rapidly gain insight on the
mechanism. By coordinating the selection of test compounds,
cellular model, timing, and dosing levels, these methods
jointly identified the mechanism for cytotoxicity and sug-
gested an appropriate biochemical assay to confirm direct
inhibition of microtubule polymerization as the cytotoxic
target, rather than a kinase. Identifying the most informative
assays is the biggest hurdle in mechanism of action studies.
Our approach of combining high-content assays with
expression profiling could be extended to larger data sets of
quantified phenotypic (14) and gene expression (10) data.

Materials and Methods

Source and Quality of Compounds
Compounds 1 to 6 were synthesized as described in the
Supplementary Tables.1 Compound purity was z97% as
determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance.
Compound identities were confirmed by low-resolution
mass spectrometry combined with 1H, 19F, and 13C nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometry. Solvents and reagents
were purchased from commercial sources and used
without further purification. Nocodazole and paclitaxel
were purchased commercially (Sigma-Aldrich). All com-
pounds were resuspended in DMSO at 10 mmol/L (final)
and diluted in culture medium before addition to cells.

In vitro LIMK Inhibition Assays
The protein kinase domains of human LIMK1 (accession
no. P53667, amino acids 321-647) and LIMK2 (accession no.
P53671, amino acids 312-638) were expressed as glutathi-
one S-transferase fusion proteins using the Bac-to-Bac
system (Invitrogen) in Sf9 cells. Compounds 1 to 6 were
assayed for inhibition of LIMK1 and LIMK2 protein kinase
activity by radioactive phosphate incorporation into bio-
tinylated full-length human destrin (accession no. P60981).
Reactions were done with a concentration series of
compound in 25 mmol/L HEPES, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 Amol/L total ATP,
83 Ag/mL biotinylated destrin, 167 ng/mL glutathione
S-transferase-LIMK1, or 835 ng/mL glutathione S-trans-
ferase-LIMK2 in a total volume of 60 AL at room
temperature for 30 min (LIMK1) or 60 min (LIMK2).
Reactions were terminated by addition of 140 AL of 20%
TCA/100 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, and the precip-
itates were harvested onto GF/C unifilter plates (Perkin-
Elmer). The radioactivity incorporated was determined
using a TopCount (Packard Instruments) after addition of
35 AL Microscint scintillation fluid (Perkin-Elmer).

Multiplexed High-Content Assay for Cell Count, DNA

Content, Phospho-Histone H3, and A-Tubulin

A549 human lung cancer cells were seeded in collagen
1-coated black/clear 96-well assay plates (BD Biosciences)
in RPMI 1640/5% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) at 7,000 per
well (for 2 h treatment) or 4,000 per well (for 24 h treatment)
16 h before treatment with vehicle or compounds (final
0.1% DMSO) for 2 or 24 h as indicated.

Following incubation, cells were fixed at room temper-
ature with 2.3% formaldehyde (final), blocked in PBS with
0.25% Triton X-100 plus 2% bovine serum albumin, and
stained with 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (fluorescent
channel 1), mouse anti-a-tubulin followed by Alexa 488
goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen; fluorescent channel 2) and
Alexa 546-phalloidin (Invitrogen; fluorescent channel 3),
and rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (Millipore/Upstate)
followed by Alexa 647 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen; fluo-
rescent channel 4). Images were obtained with a Cellomics

1-3) and XF110 (channel 4) filter sets and analyzed using
the Target Activation V2 Bioapplication (ThermoFisher
Scientific). For a-tubulin measurements at 2 h, staining for
phospho-histone H3 was used to exclude mitotic cells.
No gating was used for 24 h measurements.

High-Content Phospho-Cofilin Assay
A549 cells were seeded at 3,000 per well in collagen
1-coated black/clear 96-well assay plates (BD Biosciences)
in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum and incubated
overnight. The medium was replaced with RPMI 1640/
0.1% fetal bovine serum and cells were incubated an
additional 24 h. The cells were then returned to RPMI
1640/10% fetal bovine serum and treated with compound
or vehicle for 2 h (final 1% DMSO). Cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde and stained with 6-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole (fluorescent channel 1) and rabbit anti-phospho-
cofilin (Biosource) followed by Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit

with the XF100 filter set and analyzed using the Target
Activation V2 Bioapplication (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Dose-Response Analysis of High-Content Assay Data
Results were normalized to the mean of the DMSO
control data and plotted as individual data points. Curves
were fit using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).

Expression Profiling
Three biological replicate samples for each treatment were
handled in separate blocks throughout. A549 cells were
seeded at 50,000/cm2 in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum
(Cellgro) 16 h before treatment with vehicle or compounds
(final 0.5% DMSO)
for 7 h. RNA was prepared by
manufacturer’s protocols using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen; experiment 1) or the ABI 6100 (Applied Biosystems;
experiment 2) followed by the RNAClean kit (Agencourt
Bioscience) and evaluation of integrity on a Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent Technologies). Total RNA was processed for
Human Genome U133A_2 (2.5 Ag; experiment 1) or HT
Human Genome U133A (1 Ag; experiment 2) arrays and
scanned with a GCS3000 (experiment 1) or a GeneChip HT
scanner (experiment 2) using the manufacturer’s protocols
(Affymetrix). Background signal was defined as the highest
intensity value observed for the AFFX_TrpnX probesets. The
ArrayExpress identifier for these data is E-TABM-450.

Tubulin Polymerization Assay
Compounds at 2 mmol/L in DMSO were diluted to 100
Amol/L in assay buffer [80 mmol/L sodium PIPES (pH 6.9),
1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA]. One-tenth volume was
added to assay buffer containing 4.5 mg/mL purified
bovine neuronal tubulin (Cytoskeleton) 15% glycerol (v/v)
and 2 mmol/L GTP on ice. Reaction mixes were transferred
to 37jC, and absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 60 min
at 1 min intervals preceded by 5 s of orbital shaking using a
Spectramax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).

Statistical Analysis
Principal component analysis of high-content assay data
was done using a correlation matrix with normalized
eigenvector scaling in Genomics Suite 6.2 (Partek). For

3492

Tubulin as a Novel Target of Kinase Inhibitors

expression profiling data, both two-way ANOVA analyses
and paired t tests (two-tailed) using handling block as a
random factor were done on the variance stabilization
normalization intensity values (19) for each treatment and
the vehicle control using the ANOVA and step-up false
discovery rate functions in Genomics Suite 6.2 (Partek). The
general conclusions from ANOVA and t test analyses were
identical; results from the t test analysis are presented because
they are independent of other treatment data. For the false
discovery rate calculation, only probesets for which at least
two samples showed signal above negative controls were
included (20930 for experiment 1 and 20479 for experiment 2).
To select lists for enrichment analysis, we used the recom-
mendations of the MicroArray Quality Control Consortium
(20): for each treatment, the probesets with P V 0.01 were

ranked in order of absolute fold change (mean of 3 replicates).
We then calculated the odds for the observed representation
of each Gene Ontology (GO) category in sublists taken
incrementally from this ranked set based on the hyper-
geometric distribution of i, n, m, and N (where i is the number
in the sublist that matches a GO category, n is the number on
the array that matches a GO category, m is = the number on
the array that does not match a GO category, and N is the
number of probesets in the sublist). The lowest P value
obtained from all sublists is presented and contains a
Bonferroni correction for both the number of probesets in
the sublist and the number assigned to the GO category.

Results

Identification of an Off-Target Activity in a Series of

Kinase Inhibitors

Within a series of kinase inhibitors, early compounds
such as 1 and 2 inhibited LIMK activity in vitro and affected
cell proliferation and survival in vivo (Table 1). However,
some later compounds showed either LIMK inhibition
(e.g., compound 3) or proliferation and survival effects
(e.g., compounds 5 and 6). A structurally distinct com-
pound, 4, also inhibited LIMKs in vitro but did not affect
cell survival or proliferation. These observations suggested
that the cytotoxic activity of early compounds resulted

2 pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

Mol Cancer Ther 2008;7(11). November 2008

from a second target unrelated to LIMK inhibition and led
us to classify 1 and 2 as ‘‘dual’’ (having both cytotoxic and
LIMK activities), 3 and 4 as ‘‘LIMKi’’ (noncytotoxic LIMK
inhibitors), and 5 and 6 as ‘‘cytotoxic’’ (having cytotoxic
activity but no LIMK activity). Like the dual compounds
1 and 2, the LIMKi 3 and 4 inhibited phosphorylation of the
LIMK substrate cofilin in a cellular assay (Fig. 1A), showing
that their lack of cytotoxicity was not due to lack of uptake;
the apparent increase in phospho-cofilin intensity for 6 is
caused by mitotic cell rounding. Binding assays (21) on a
panel of 41 kinases (compounds 5 and 6) or 287 kinases
(compounds 2-4) indicated that both cytotoxic and dual
compounds retain the ability to inhibit protein kinases.
However, no shared target was identified in the 41 protein
kinases tested with dual compound 2 and cytotoxic
compounds 5 and 6 (see Supplementary Table S1)1.

High-Content Assays Indicate an Effect on Micro-

tubule Stability

We tested compounds from all three classes for effects
on proliferation and survival in A549 human lung cancer
cells using our standard panel of high-content assays for
cell count, nuclear DNA content, histone H3 phosphoryla-
tion, and a-tubulin intensity (Fig. 1). The dual compounds
1 and 2 caused a dose-dependent reduction in cell count
(Fig. 1B) and induced mitotic arrest as shown by increases
in total nuclear DNA intensity (Fig. 1C) and histone H3

3494

Tubulin as a Novel Target of Kinase Inhibitors

phosphorylation (Fig. 1D) after 24 h treatment. Cytotoxic 6
proved highly potent, causing similar effects even at the
lowest dose tested of 14 nmol/L. A dose-dependent increase
of caspase-3 activation was seen after 24 h of treatment with
1, 5, or 6 (data not shown), showing that the reduction in cell
count results from a combination of increased apoptosis and
decreased proliferation. By contrast, LIMKi 4 had no effect
on these variables even at the highest dose tested.

Our high-content assay panel included a-tubulin immu-
nofluorescence as an indicator of cell rounding in mitosis or
apoptosis. However, we observed a distinctive and potent
effect
for the cytotoxic and dual compounds on this
measurement (Fig. 2). Cytotoxic 6 reduced the intensity of
localized a-tubulin staining in the majority of cells after
2 h (Fig. 2B). By contrast, LIMKi 3 treatment was indis-
tinguishable from the control treatment even at the highest
dose tested (Fig. 2C). The effects of the dual compounds 1
and 2 resembled those of cytotoxic compound 6 (Fig. 2D)
and are similar to treatment with the known cytotoxic
microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole (13).

The overall similarity between phenotypic effects of our
inhibitors and those of nocodazole was identified and
quantified by principal component analysis of data from
30 cytologic features drawn from several distinct high-
content assays (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S2).1 These
features reflect nuclear morphology, DNA content, apo-
ptosis induction, microtubules, actin filaments, and cofilin
phosphorylation. Our cytotoxic compounds (compounds 1,
5, and 6) nocodazole and paclitaxel all showed dose-
dependent separation from LIMKi 3 and the DMSO control
in principal component 1, and dual compound 1 and
cytotoxics 5 and 6 grouped with nocodazole rather than
paclitaxel in principal component 2.

Expression Profiling Indicates an Effect on Micro-

tubule Stability

Our studies on the effects of the compounds on gene
expression were guided by early results from high-content
assays for cell count and cofilin phosphorylation (Fig. 1).
A treatment of only 7 h was chosen to precede apoptosis,
whereas dose levels (see Table 1) captured both cytotoxic

activity and cellular inhibition of LIMK for the dual com-
pounds 1 and 2, captured LIMK inhibition for compounds
3 and 4, and captured cytotoxicity for compounds 5 and 6
and nocodazole. The cytotoxic treatments (compounds 1,
2, 5, and 6 and nocodazole) had a very limited effect on
transcript
levels, with only a few genes identified as
differentially regulated (Fig. 4A; see Supplementary Table
31 for all P values and fold-change). However, a striking
predominance of tubulin subunit genes was noted. A
statistical analysis confirmed that genes assigned to GO
(22) categories involving microtubules were significantly
overrepresented in the transcripts affected by three com-
pounds with cytotoxic activity (compounds 2, 5, and 6).
This category was also overrepresented for nocodazole
(Fig. 4B). The level of certain tubulin subunit mRNAs is
known to be directly regulated by unpolymerized tubulin
subunits (23). The Affymetrix array contains probesets for
17 tubulin subunits; a dose-related decrease in signal for up
to eight of these was seen with the dual (1 and 2) and
cytotoxic (5 and 6) compounds and nocodazole but not
with the LIMKi compounds 3 and 4 (Fig. 4C). Thus, all
compounds with cytotoxic activity (compounds 1, 2, 5,
and 6 and nocodazole) reduced the levels of
tubulin
transcripts (although the data for dual compound 1 did
not meet strict criteria for significance in this treatment).

Our mRNA expression profiling did not suggest any
additional sources of cytotoxic activity for the compounds
at the doses used. For our three compounds with cytotoxic
activity in profiling experiment 2 (compounds 2, 5, and 6),
there were nine shared probesets that met the criteria
of >1.2-fold change, 20% false discovery rate (Fig. 4A);
all correspond to tubulin subunits. Within the relaxed
significance limit of P < 0.01 used to select probesets for
enrichment analysis (Fig. 4B), only 13 probesets were

Mol Cancer Ther 2008;7(11). November 2008

affected by all three compounds, and all correspond to
tubulin subunits.

Cytotoxic Compounds Inhibit Tubulin Polymerization

In vitro

To determine whether the cytotoxic and dual compounds
act directly on tubulin subunits, we performed in vitro
tubulin polymerization assays using purified compo-
nents (Fig. 5). Relative to the vehicle control, addition of
10 Amol/L paclitaxel accelerated formation of micro-
tubules, whereas 10 Amol/L nocodazole decreased both
the rate and the overall level of microtubule formation.
Addition of either 10 Amol/L 2 (dual) or 10 Amol/L
5 (cytotoxic) also decreased the rate and level of microtu-
bule polymerization. Both compounds caused greater
inhibition than the known microtubule-depolymerizing
agent nocodazole. By contrast, LIMKi 3 had no effect on
the rate of signal increase and little or no effect on the final
levels. Thus, the cytotoxic and dual compounds act directly
on tubulin subunits to affect their polymerization.

Effects on Tubulin Are Not Predicted by Structural

Analysis

We performed comparisons of our compound series and
known microtubule-destabilizing agents using a circular
molecular fingerprint (see Materials and Methods). The
highest Tanimoto similarity was 0.24 for cytotoxic 6 versus
nocodazole (Table 1). The initial lead compounds 1 and 2,
which are potent inhibitors of both LIMK activity and tubulin
polymerization, have even lower similarity scores, equiva-
lent to those of the noncytotoxic LIMKi 3 and 4. Although
the Tanimoto scores for similarity to colchicine were V0.12
(Table 1), in a retrospective visual inspection of the series, a
similarity to the colchicine pharmacophore (24) was noted.
Comparison of nocodazole to 8,477 reported kinase inhib-
itors from WOMBAT and AUREUS databases identified 168

3496

Tubulin as a Novel Target of Kinase Inhibitors

compounds with Tanimoto scores that were higher than the
0.24 similarity score for compound 6 (Supplementary Table
S4).1 Two of the 168 compounds (a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor and a LCK inhibitor) had Tanimoto scores greater
than 0.4 against nocodazole, suggesting that microtubule-
depolymerizing activity exists in additional chemical series
of kinase inhibitors.

Discussion
Having established that
the cytotoxicity of early lead
compounds resulted from activity on a second target

unrelated to their potent LIMK inhibition, we used cell-
based core technology platforms to determine that such
compounds act to destabilize microtubules. High-content
assays showed that loss of localized a-tubulin immunoflu-
orescence in cells treated with dual activity or cytotoxic
compounds coincides with the induction of mitotic arrest
and reduction in cell number. An unsupervised analysis of
the phenotypic data showed clustering with the micro-
tubule destabilizer nocodazole. Expression profiling
showed that the only consistent changes observed across
treatments with both cytotoxic and dual activity com-
pounds were significant reductions in tubulin subunit

Effect of compounds on tubulin polymeri-
zation in vitro. Dual compound 2 (red diamonds ),
LIMKi compound 3 (green crosses ), and cytotoxic
compound 5 (light blue circles ), paclitaxel (brown
squares ), and nocodazole (yellow triangles ) were
tested for effects on polymerization of purified bovine
brain tubulin and quantified by absorbance at 340 nm.
All compounds were tested at 10 Amol/L in 0.5%
DMSO. Gray open diamonds, a control treatment with

mRNAs. This rapid and highly specific effect also pointed to
microtubule depolymerization, which is known to cause
post-transcriptional destabilization of tubulin subunit tran-
scripts (25). Although others have implicated LIMK1 in
control of microtubules (17), their work predicts that LIMK
inhibition would stabilize microtubules. Finally, we showed
that dual compound 2 and cytotoxic compounds 5 directly
depolymerize microtubules in vitro, but the closely related
LIMKi compound 3 does not. The direct effect on tubulin
polymerization in vitro is sufficient to explain the activity of
cytotoxic and dual compounds, because known depolyme-
rizing agents such as nocodazole are cytotoxic (26).

It is commonly assumed that additional targets of kinase
inhibitors will be kinases or at least ATP-binding proteins.
However, there are recent reports of potent and specific
interactions between kinase inhibitors and a G-protein-
coupled receptor (6) and with two nicotinamide-dependent
oxidoreductases (5, 7, 8). Demonstration of the GTPase
tubulin as a third novel target highlights our incomplete
understanding of this therapeutic class. Microtubule activ-
ity was not anticipated in our compound series or predicted
by a routine structural comparison.

Measuring structure/activity relationships at the cellular
level is receiving increasing attention. A recent analysis of
>6,000 diverse compounds using high-content assays
similar to ours noted that 4% of compounds with Tanimoto
similarity of z0.3 show discordant phenotypes (14). Com-
bining multiple approaches might indicate off-target activ-
ities that are not evaluated through typical in vitro selectivity
screens, which typically incorporate only other kinases (21)
and enzymes or receptors that mediate clinical liabilities.

Compounds with unknown targets are disfavored for
development as drugs and have limited utility as experi-
mental probes of cellular function. Off-target activity may
affect the development of a drug in several ways. For
example,
identification of an additional, proapoptotic
target for a class of farnesyl transferase inhibitors had
implications for both efficacy and toxicity (27). However, it
is not always obvious that an observed effect of a com-

pound is not mediated by the intended target. This is
especially difficult with oncology compounds, where
growth inhibition is often a primary assay. In the present
case, the potent cytotoxicity of early compounds was noted
because although LIMKs regulate tumor cell invasion and
proliferation (28, 29), neither kinase had been identified as
essential for cell survival. However, only the divergence of
LIMK inhibition and cytotoxicity that was revealed by later
compounds confirmed that a second target existed. Once
off-target activity has been recognized, it remains to identify
the unknown molecular target. There is no clear best practice
for this (30), and published examples of success are rare (31).
Analyses of kinase inhibitor selectivity often focus on
selectivity versus other protein kinases (32) and methods
are available to test this (3). Our findings and others (6, 7)
show that additional, non-ATP-dependent proteins may also
mediate off-target effects of kinase inhibitors.

We have shown that combining two cell-based platforms
(high-content assays and mRNA expression profiling)
provides a powerful system for identifying and guiding
the analysis of off-target activities. A potential mechanism
need not be hypothesized in advance, and specific
confirmatory assays can be selected based on the results.
High-content assays enable rapid, low-cost examination of
many compounds in phenotypic assays such cell cycle
progression (14) combined with mechanistic assays such as
phosphorylation of a kinase substrate (33). By contrast,
expression profiling provides a broad measure of cellular
state without needing a physiologic endpoint and facilitates
comparison with previous data (10). In this work, results
from routine high-content assays directed the design of
expression profiling studies;
in other cases, expression
profiling results could suggest mechanistic endpoints for
confirmation in high-content assays. In either case, coordi-
nated selection of test compounds, cellular model, timing,
and dosing levels simplifies interpretation of the combined
result set. Our success illustrates that combining informa-
tion from generic assays can identify the specific and labor-
intensive assays that ultimately confirm the target.
