Abstract
The growing availability of large-scale functional networks has promoted the development of many successful
techniques for predicting functions of genes. Here we extend these network-based principles and techniques to
functionally characterize whole sets of genes. We present RIDDLE (Reflective Diffusion and Local Extension), which
uses well developed guilt-by-association principles upon a human gene network to identify associations of gene
sets. RIDDLE is particularly adept at characterizing sets with no annotations, a major challenge where most
traditional set analyses fail. Notably, RIDDLE found microRNA-450a to be strongly implicated in ocular diseases and
development. A web application is available at www.functionalnet.org/RIDDLE.

Background
In the modern age of high-throughput genetic studies,
functional enrichment analyses remain a vital approach to
analyzing data. Microarray, mass spectrometry, genome-
wide association, and other genome-level studies com-
monly produce query gene sets - gene sets of interest,
often containing many uncharacterized members, from
which coherent biological modules need to be identified.
There exist many methods that attempt to discover
known biological functions involved with a query set,
most of which fall under one of three broad categories:
overlap-based, rank-based, and local network-based.

In the classic overlap-based enrichment analysis
(Figure 1a), the functional annotations for the genes in the
query set are examined. An annotation is enriched if it is
present in the gene set at a greater than expected fre-
quency, the significance of which may be computed
through a statistical test (for example, the hypergeometric
test [1]). In contrast, in rank-based methods (Figure 1b),

such as [2,3], genes are first ranked by some suitable mea-
sure, for example, differential expression across two differ-
ent conditions, and possible enrichment is found near the
extremes of the list. Rank-based methods are usually highly
specialized for gene expression array analysis. Both overlap
and rank-based methods require the queried genes to be
sufficiently annotated.

In some more recently developed local-network meth-
ods (Figure 1c), a query set is compared against the genes
and internal interactions of a known functional pathway.
These interactions may be visualized as a map or net-
work, in which nodes represent genes and connecting
edges represent interactions. While these methods move
towards the idea of finding contributive information
from gene networks, they often require sophisticated
information about a single pathway under investigation,
such as a detailed sub-network of interactions [4-6],
directionality of edges [7-9], or additional interactions
between shared and non-shared genes of the query and
pathway sets [10].

In principle, substantial benefit can be achieved by con-
sidering a global network of gene or protein interactions.
Many such networks have become available in recent years
(for example, [11-17]), compiled from various independent
lines of evidence into a rich resource fit for facilitating sys-
tematic functional analyses. In these networks, interacting,

Figure 1 A summary of four basic types of tests identifying functional pathway enrichment of a query gene set. (a) In the classic enrichment
test, the significance of genes shared by the query and pathway set is assessed. (b) In a rank-based test, each gene is first ranked by an
appropriate score, for example, differential expression. A pathway is significant if the corresponding genes are located near the top or bottom of
the list. (c) Local network-based methods consider the known topological information between pathway genes. (d) Global network-based

co-expressed, and other evidently associated genes are
linked to or lie close to one another in the topology, facili-
tating the application of guilt-by-association (GBA) meth-
ods for predicting functionally associated genes. Indeed,
GBA principles have allowed accurate predictions of not
only functionally associated genes, but also genes underly-
ing phenotypes and diseases [12,16-24]. The concept of
utilizing both direct and indirect linkages between genes
has been widely explored (for example, [22,25,26]). In par-
ticular, diffusion algorithms, which spread information
across the network topology, have been extensively studied
and shown to be extremely effective across numerous
settings (for example, [15,24,27-31]).

Since functional networks have proven useful for identi-
fying single genes functionally related to a gene set, we
hypothesized that a global-network approach would also
assist in identifying modules of genes functionally related
to a gene set (Figure 1d). Here we present Reflective Diffu-
sion and Local Extension (RIDDLE), an integrative method
for systematically interrogating if a query gene set lies
close to a known functional pathway in a genome-scale
functional protein network. We show that the combina-
tory use of global-network, local-network, and classic
enrichment information more reliably identifies relevant
gene sets than existing methods. Notably, we can find
functionally related sets even when the query gene set is
sparsely or not at all annotated. Because RIDDLE can
measure association between any two gene sets that are
contained within the network, it is potentially applicable
to a wide variety of settings without the need for addi-
tional pathway-specific information. As an example, a
search for diseases associated with predicted microRNA
(miRNA) targets led us to discover evidence of an ocular
acting miRNA - a finding supported by literature and our
own experimental confirmation of developmental mouse
eye gene expression analyses. A web-based implementa-
tion of our method is available.

Results and discussion
Overview of RIDDLE methodology
RIDDLE contains two key independent parts, reflective dif-
fusion (RD) and local extension (LE), and uses a human
functional interaction network developed previously [15].
In principle, any other such genome-scale functional gene
network could be employed (for example, [11,12,16,30,
32,33]) provided they exhibit high coverage of the set of
human genes and high specificity for the gene-gene interac-
tions. Given a query set, RIDDLE examines the network for
closely positioned known functional gene sets. For the RD
component, we adapt a diffusion algorithm shown pre-
viously to work well with our network [15,30]. RD evaluates
overall connectivity between a query set and known path-
way set by loading one (seed set) into the diffusion algo-
rithm [30], then assessing how well a second (terminal set)
is predicted or recovered by the measures area under the
ROC curve (AUC) and average precision (AP) (Figure 2).
The diffusion analysis is repeated such that both the query
and known pathway sets have a turn to serve as the seed
set (thus the term reflective). Note that in this context,
AUC and AP are employed as convenient summary statis-
tics of the proximity of two gene sets within the network,
regardless of whether the gene sets are indeed functionally
associated.

Meanwhile, the LE component performs a more loca-
lized interrogation, extending either the query or pathway
set to include strongly implicated direct neighbors [18]
and checking for improved enrichment with each new set
(Figure 3). In gene set enrichment analyses, a query set
commonly overlaps weakly with multiple functional gene
sets. The extension process serves to strengthen genuine
functional relationships; spurious matches are less likely
to be improved with network information.

Naturally, overlap-based methods perform most
strongly when a substantial overlap exists between the
query set and the relevant functional set. In contrast,

Recall

Figure 2 Reflective diffusion (RD) operates on the principal that a seed set predicts a terminal set if the terminal genes are ranked
highly by network diffusion score. Recovery is measured by area under the ROC curve (AUC) or average precision (AP). Higher scores for both
measures indicate stronger functional association.

network-based methods dominate when little or no
overlap is present (as we will describe fully in the fol-
lowing sections). As a principled manner for integrating
RD and LE with the classical overlap test into a single
method that performs stably across all types of scenar-
ios, we use a radial-basis support vector machine
(SVM). Additionally, a machine learning approach is
ideal for capturing any complex relationships that may
exist between different measurements. Finally, we note
that while powerful, network analyses must be used dis-
cerningly to avoid introducing systematic biases or arti-
facts, some of which we describe below.

Centrality and size affect network-based measurements
In order to first survey general properties of functional
gene sets in the network, we used RD-AUC to measure

the connectivity between various combinations of pathway
gene sets defined in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) and random gene sets. Surprisingly,
resulting AUCs are not necessarily near 0.5, but seem to
vary according to certain characteristics of the genes
involved. To demonstrate the possible range of these
intrinsic AUCs, we used 100 random seed sets of fixed
size and weighted node degree to predict each KEGG set.
The mean AUC for each KEGG set ranges from 0.164 to
0.849, and the standard deviation from 0.003 to 0.160
(Figure S1a in Additional file 1). Figure S1b in Additional
file 1 displays in detail the distributions for a range of
KEGG sets; some gene sets, such as genes for glyceropho-
spholipid metabolism, are clearly more difficult to recover,
while others, such as genes annotated for renal cell carci-
noma, are easier to recover.

We found the strongest predictor for intrinsic AUC to
be the average centrality, or sum of connecting network
edge weights to a gene, of the members of the terminal
set. As shown in Figure 4a, the average centrality of the
terminal set is positively correlated with the average
AUC obtained from random seed sets of a fixed size and
centrality (r = 0.70, slope = 1.34e-3). This confounding
relationship between AUC and centrality has recently
been described and examined extensively [34]. Intuitively,
a well-connected gene in the network interacts with more
partners and is more likely to be involved in any given
function. However, we cannot easily distinguish between
a biological hub and a well-studied gene. Moreover,
centrality should certainly not overweigh the other pieces
of information that factor into a prediction algorithm.
However, by accounting for this behavior in some fashion
- for example, by considering a relative AUC score - AUC
can, in principle, still be used to make genuine predic-
tions. Importantly, in the next section we report that
AUC may indeed be successfully employed as a measure
of gene set connectivity and, furthermore, ranking gene sets
by highest average centrality can only achieve a small frac-
tion of this performance (Figure S3 in Additional file 1).

We also looked for similar unexpected trends when
using RD-AP to measure connectivity between random
and KEGG gene sets. Here, the average scores obtained
for predicting KEGG sets range from 0 to 0.039 (Figure S2
in Additional file 1). Though AP in principle ranges from
0 to 1, the random APs are more tightly distributed
around a low value (0.006). AP is also affected by terminal

set centrality; however, the slope of the relationship is
much less steep (Figure 4b; r = 0.41, slope = 3.76e-5). We
found that terminal set size is a much stronger predictor
of AP but not AUC (Figure 5; r = 0.89, slope = 9.14e-5).
To help understand why AP would tend to increase with
terminal set size, consider the extreme case where the
terminal set equals the entire set of known genes. Because
every gene is contained within the terminal set, the AP
will equal 1. Notably, if we normalize AP by the terminal
set size, the correlative trends with size and centrality
diminish greatly (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). Finally,
we looked for trends associated with seed set characteris-
tics, but these were relatively minor (data not shown).

These results suggest that network-based analyses and,
more generally, performance measures should be care-
fully evaluated. Interestingly, when measuring the same
data set, centrality more strongly affects AUC than AP,
while size affects AP but has no apparent influence on
AUC. In the apparent lack of a perfect performance mea-
sure, we find a productive solution is to apply great care
in properly interpreting a measure for the task in ques-
tion. For example, while many pathways will sit close to a
highly central gene set, a match is only interesting if it is
exceptionally strong. We show below that AUC and AP
are clearly effective for correctly identifying associated
gene sets. Because of these unexpected trends we
observed with AUC and AP, we chose to employ an SVM
to model any complexities that exist between our perfor-
mance measures and centrality, size, and other relevant
gene set features.

Application to simulated data sets
Given these observations on the intrinsic predictability of
functional gene sets using the network, we next wished to
assess the utility of RIDDLE for correctly associating func-
tionally related gene sets. We therefore created subsets of
known gene sets and tested our method’s ability to cor-
rectly match the subsets. Specifically, we created several
types of tests from genes in KEGG and Gene Ontology
(GO) pathways, where each test case consists of a pathway
divided into a query subset and a known subset. For each
query subset, we ranked all generated known subsets by
their RIDDLE association score (RAS). We purposefully
designed tests where subsets of a pathway are excluded
from sharing genes, simulating the extreme case where
query genes are completely unannotated. Also, we note
that KEGG information was not incorporated into con-
structing the functional network, reducing the potential
for logical circularity. As further affirmation of the inde-
pendence between GO and KEGG, the Jaccard similarity
coefficient between linkages defined by the two databases
is 0.017, or only 6.4% of all KEGG-based links.

We first assessed test cases allowing overlap, which were
created by random drawings from known gene sets with
replacement. Here, RIDDLE correctly recovers matching
subsets for 84% and 68% of KEGG and GO gene sets,
respectively (Figure 6a,b), nearly matching the performance
achieved by a hypergeometric test. The performance is
robust to the gene set database used, for the trend is similar
across subsets created from KEGG and GO.

Next, we considered test cases explicitly containing no
overlap: (1) KEGG and (2) GO sets split disjointly in
half and (3) GO genes present before and added after

5 February 2007. Here, not surprisingly, the hypergeo-
metric test fails catastrophically and does not perfectly
match any subsets (Figure 7a-c). In these tests, the bene-
fit of the individual components of RIDDLE is clear; a
substantial number of matches are recovered utilizing
LE alone, and even more so with RD. Overall, RIDDLE
correctly matches pathways for 80% of KEGG test cases.
GO cases present a significantly harder challenge for all
methods; 31% and 5% of GO random-split and time-
split cases are recovered by RIDDLE. Though GO time-
split cases are the most difficult, a clear advantage is
gained by employing network diffusion.

The hypergeometric test and the individual RIDDLE
components each exhibit individual areas of extreme
strength and weakness (summarized in Table 1; detailed
results of each component are shown in Figure S3 in Addi-
tional file 1). However, the combined RIDDLE method is
stable across all test types; RIDDLE nearly matches or bests
the other components regardless of the test database or the
allowance or exclusion of overlap between subsets. We also
note that many gene sets within KEGG and GO are closely
related, adding another level of difficulty to these tests.
Highly ranked pathways, while not the correct match, are
often biologically related. For example, RIDDLE identifies
‘axon guidance’ as the top match for ‘neuron projection
development’, ‘triglyceride metabolic process’ is matched
with ‘steroid and cholesterol metabolic process’, and
‘response to virus’
is matched with ‘innate immune
response’, ‘response to bacterium’, and‘ defense response to
virus’. In fact, RIDDLE can correctly match many sibling
gene sets of the same category in the KEGG hierarchy
(Figure S4 and Table S1 in Additional file 1).

shown for RIDDLE, the RD and LE components in the reverse direction, and the hypergeometric test (HG).

Matching microRNA targets with disease genes
Finally, we looked for functional associations of miRNAs.
miRNAs are thought to regulate gene expression by repres-
sion, but due to widespread gene targeting, the overall
functionality of particular miRNAs is poorly understood.
We matched predicted targets of miRNAs with disease-
associated genes (Table S2 in Additional file 2). Generally,
most miRNA targets seem to be associated with a large
number of diseases, agreeing with a growing body of evi-
dence linking individual miRNAs to multiple biological
pathways and diseases [35]. However, we discovered an
interesting case of a miRNA that scores highly with numer-
ous eye diseases.

Three predicted targets of miR-450a - Dusp10, Amd1/2,
and Znf385a - are significantly close to genes of numerous
different eye-specific diseases in the network. Four of the
top six disease matches for miR-450a are eye-specific
(Table 2). Remarkably, none of the disease genes, which
are mostly unique across the diseases, are shared with the
miRNA targets. For example, miR-450a targets are com-
pletely disjoint with macular dystrophy genes and share
only a single direct connection (Figure 8a). The homolo-
gue of miR-450a is already known to be expressed in the
cornea in mouse [36]. We performed an additional North-
ern analysis on total RNA from mouse eyes across various
stages of development and found that, consistent with a
role in the developing eye, miR-450a is expressed from
embryonic day 13 (E13) to postnatal day 7 (P7), peaking
near E17, and undetectable in adult eyes (Figure 8b).
Quantitative real-time PCR experiments show expression
of miR-450a’s predicted targets to be lower during these
stages (Figure 8c). Dusp10 expression increases after
P2 but falls again after P4, suggesting the presence of

additional gene regulation. Overall, these data confirm
miR-450a expression in the mammalian eye, suggest that
miR-450a plays a regulatory role in eye development and
supports the predicted linkage of the miRNA to eye
diseases.

Arriving at a tissue-specific role for a miRNA without the
use of any tissue-specific data was a surprising and interest-
ing result. While some large-scale tissue-specific gene
expression data are available via in situ experiments (for
example, [37]), pigment color further hinders eye-specific
expression measurements. RIDDLE discovered this func-
tional association without any knowledge of the expression
patterns of miR-450a or the predicted targets. We also note
that this association relied entirely on RIDDLE’s use
of network connectivity, as no genes were shared between
the miR-450a targets and the disease pathways (Figure 8a).

Conclusions
We tested our method across the two possible extremes
when identifying functional enrichment: either a substan-
tial amount or none of the query set is annotated. We see
that RIDDLE is best for the latter extreme without com-
promising much performance in the former. In contrast,
the standard hypergeometric test - or any other method
relying on the assumption of well-annotated query sets -
fails catastrophically for split cases. Unfortunately, know-
ing where data lie in this spectrum of ‘overlap’ is only
possible in simulations. Thus, RIDDLE serves as a robust,
general purpose method, drawing on the strengths of
each individual component. We note that it nonetheless
has intrinsic limitations, most notably, that it is limited
by the gene coverage of the network (currently 87% of
the human genes [15]).

Figure 7 RIDDLE performs superiorly in matching disjoint gene subsets. (a-c) RIDDLE matches many disjoint subsets of various gene sets
created by dividing KEGG pathway sets (a) and GO biological process sets (b) randomly into non-overlapping halves, and splitting GO biological
process sets (c) by those annotated prior to and after 9 February 2007. Note the failure of hypergeometric for all three cases and the
incremental improvement obtained by each component and the final combinatory RIDDLE method.

Many sophisticated schemes exist for finding functional
association, encompassing a wide range of data transfor-
mations and statistical models (discussed extensively in
[38]). Regardless of the approach used, the success of an
analysis requires that the query and pathway genes are
well-annotated. While approximately 78% of protein-cod-
ing genes currently have some level of annotation in the
commonly used GO database, a substantial portion of
these genes have only minimal, high-level annotations.
There are many local network-based methods, though in
addition to adequate annotations, they require a detailed
mapping of the pathway interactions, of which only a lim-
ited number are available. Thus, a global network-based
method provides a feasible alternative when only partial
information is known of the query or pathway genes.

Recently, a number of global network-based methods
have been developed, an indicator of the progression and
growing importance of this strategy. For example, GsNet-
Com, a method using cumulative shortest path length can
correctly match most overlapping sets and, indeed, many
disjoint sets [39]. However, the method falls short of RID-
DLE for disjoint sets, once again asserting the benefit of
considering whole network topology through a diffusion
algorithm, and furthermore, the power of using an inte-
grative method (Figures S3 and S5 in Additional file 1).

Starred entries indicate eye-specific diseases. FDR, false discovery rate; OMIM,
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man; RAS, RIDDLE association score.

RIDDLE does benefit from using a more complete net-
work with edges assembled from quality-weighted data,
for implementing the GsNetCom method with HumanNet
obtained a moderate improvement (Figure S5 in Addi-
tional file 1). In another example, Huttenhower and collea-
gues [16] define the association between gene sets as the
amount of cross-talk, or strength of direct linkages
between two gene sets (see also the similarly based
method by Li et al. [10]). This slightly less robust method
performs comparably with RIDDLE in many but not all
test cases (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Additionally,
other global network applications have emerged for the
highly related but distinct task of analyzing gene expres-
sion microarrays (for example, [40]). These methods have
demonstrated the utility of mapping differential expression
onto a protein interaction network for deducing pathway
level changes [41-43]. Again, all of these different methods
highlight the utility of using global network information in
various analyses.

In the past decade, we have seen the extensive develop-
ment of gene networks and their accompanying functional
gene analyses (reviewed in [24,31]). With the continual
production of genome-scale data, network-based analyses
are likely to become even more necessary. Here, we have
established a means for utilizing information-rich net-
works to understand gene function, achieved through a
few adaptations to existing GBA methods. There are many
previously established network-based methods among
which RIDDLE performs competitively, if not better. We
have demonstrated multiple instances where the method
is uniquely useful, such as applying RIDDLE to link a
miRNA to an array of likely relevant diseases, even when
none of the gene sets overlap. RIDDLE potentially benefits
a wide range of applications that may require the func-
tional characterization of poorly understood gene sets.

Materials and methods
Functional network
We use the human functional
interaction network
described in [15]. This network contains 476,399 links
among 16,243 genes (87% of protein coding genes) and is
constructed from various distinct lines of evidence.

Figure 8 Predicted targets of miR-450a and ocular disease genes are disjoint, yet functionally associated. (a) Targets of miR-450a
(DUSP10, AMD1, ZNF385A, colored nodes) and genes associated with macular dystrophy (ELOVL4, BEST1, PRPH2, black nodes) are ‘close’ to each
other in the human functional network (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤8.54e-3). There are no shared genes and direct connections are indicated by
bold edges. (b) Northern analysis of mouse eye total RNA suggests miR-450a is active in eye development during embryonic stages. U6
spliceosomal RNA serves as a loading control. (c) In contrast to miR-450a, predicted targets Dusp10, Amd1, and Zfp385a (mouse homolog of
ZNF385A) are expressed at low levels during early stages.

Data sets
Pathway genes were downloaded from KEGG [44,45] on
23 April 2010. GO sets were downloaded [46,47] on 7
February 2007 and 17 April 2010. In total, we acquired
811 GO biological process terms with highly reliable evi-
dence (IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP, IPI, and TAS). Conserved
targets of 153 human miRNA families were predicted by
Targetscan [48] and downloaded [49] on 15 June 2011.
Genes associated with human diseases were obtained
from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) [50] on 24 August 2008. In total, 497 multi-
gene sets are included in our match algorithm.

Simulated data sets
We created various subsets of KEGG and GO gene sets.
For a pathway of size n genes, we created the following
subsets: (1) two independent draws of 0.5 × n genes
from the pathway (allowing overlaps) and (2) a random
division of the pathway into two approximately equal
sized, non-overlapping sets. For GO gene sets, we cre-
ated an additional set of divisions by annotation time:
genes known in the 2007 version and genes unique to

the 2010 version. In total, we compiled the following
data sets: 190 of each overlapping and disjoint KEGG
sets, 404 of each overlapping and disjoint GO sets, and
811 time-split GO sets. To create random sets used for
determining AUC and AP correlation with centrality
and size, we selected a KEGG set with average centrality
approximately 100, matching the mean value among all
KEGG sets (with outlying sets of average centrality >200
removed). In order to hold size and centrality constant
over randomization, network genes were first split into
10 equally spaced bins by centrality, then for each of the
genes in the set, we randomly drew a gene from the cor-
responding bin.

Hypergeometric test
To test if a query set significantly overlaps with a pathway
set, we obtained the following P-value:
(cid:4)

(cid:3)

p(x ≥ k) =

min(n,m)(cid:2)

x=k

where N is the number of known genes, m is the num-
ber of genes in the pathway, n is the number of genes in
the query set, and k is the size of the overlap.

Local extension
To measure the local connectivity between two gene sets
in the network, s1 and s2, we extend s1 to include nearby
neighbors in the functional gene network, with ‘nearness’
of a particular gene determined by the sum of connecting
edge weights to the gene set. This is followed by a hyper-
geometric test to measure the significance of the overlap
between the extended set s1’ and s2. To avoid over-
extending the pathway to include non-specific pathway
associations, we implemented the following cutoff rule:

LE (n) = min (α··· n, β) ,
where the maximum size of the extension for the path-
way with n genes depends on the two free parameters a,
the percentage of the size of s1, and b, the maximum size
of extension. This ensures that the degree of extension is
proportional to the original size of s1. If necessary, we
allow the maximum size to be breached in order to
accommodate multiple genes of equal score. We found
LE to perform optimally with a and b equal to 0.8 and
100, respectively.

Reflective diffusion
To measure connectivity between two gene sets in the net-
work, s1 and s2, we adapted the diffusion algorithm
described in [15,30] (Figure 3). Briefly, given s1 as the input
seed set, the algorithm ranks all other genes in the network
by how strongly connected they are to the seed set. We
then have two means of measuring how well this ranked
list recovers s2, the terminal set: (1) AUC and (2) AP.

To calculate AUC, we plot true-positive rate (TP/(TP +
FN)) as a function of the false-positive rate (FP/(FP +
TN)), then find the corresponding AUC. A higher area
indicates better recovery. To calculate AP, we sort the
k genes of s2 by rank and then average the precision, or
fraction of the set recovered, achieved for each member of
the set:

RIDDLE - combining RD and LE
To measure the connectivity between a query set and a
pathway set, we perform the following: a hypergeometric
test, forward direction tests (LE and RD with query and
pathway sets as s1 and s2, respectively), and reverse
direction tests (LE and RD with pathway and query sets
as s1 and s2, respectively).

To combine the results, we used libsvm, a library of
SVM software implemented in C with a Matlab interface
[51] downloaded from [52]. We chose a radial basis ker-
nel trained with the following features: log P-values from
the hypergeometric, forward LE, and reverse LE tests,
forward RD-AUC, reverse RD-AUC, forward RD-AP,
reverse RD-AP, query size, pathway size, overlap size,
query set average centrality, pathway set average central-
ity, and percent of query genes contained in the network.
As positive training data, we used the simulated KEGG
and GO split sets. As negative training data, we included
ten mismatched pairs per simulated query set, plus ran-
dom sets of varying size paired with a randomly chosen
real (KEGG or GO) set (167 sets total).

To determine a good combination of kernel parameters
to use, we used a cross-validation and grid search techni-
que. We divided the aggregate training data into model-
ing (25%), cross-validation (25%), and final validation
(50%) sets. Overall, for modeling, we used 498 positive
pairs and 5,147 negative pairs. Because we had many
more examples of negative matches, we used a lower
weight cost for the negative class. For each combination
of parameters we trained with modeling data and mea-
sured performance with cross-validation data. We chose
a final model based on strong performance with both
overlapping and split data types and report the perfor-
mance for the final validation set. The final parameters
for our SVM are: positive match class weight w1 = 1,
negative match class weight w0 = 0.3, costC = 10e8,
termination criterion e = 0.01, kernel parameter g = 0.07.
The RAS is the score output from the trained SVM.
We calculated an empirical false discovery rate using
final validation matched subsets to generate a positive
RAS distribution and random gene sets paired with
KEGG and GO sets to generate a negative RAS distribu-
tion (Figure S7 in Additional file 1). For calculating the
false discovery rate, we normalized both positive and
negative distributions to have a total area of 1, though
in principle, the likelihood of a negative match is much
greater.

GsNetCom
Synthetic data sets were input into the batch tool gene
similarity calculator available online [39,53]. Known sets
were ranked by the resulting corrected cumulative rank
score (CCRS). Additionally, the algorithm as described
by Wang and colleagues [39] was implemented with
HumanNet.

Crosstalk
The algorithm for ‘Functional mapping associations’ as
described by Huttenhower and colleagues [16] was
implemented with HumanNet weighted linkages.

Gene expression analysis
Mouse eye total RNA samples were obtained from Zya-
gen (San Diego, CA, USA). Three mice were dissected
for each of embryonic stages E13, E15, and E17, two
mice were used for each of postnatal stages P0, P2, P4,
and P7, and 1 mouse was used for each P30 and 3
month stages.

Small RNA Northern blot analysis was performed as
previously described [54,55]. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA
was separated on a Tris-borate-EDTA-urea-15% polya-
crylamide gel. The RNA was then transferred to a
Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI,
USA), UV cross-linked, and pre-hybed for 1 hour in
ExpressHyb buffer (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA,
USA) at 55°C. Oligonucleotide probes (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) were radiolabeled
using [gamma-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Bios-
ciences, Ipswich, MA, USA). Labeled probes were hybri-
dized overnight at 38.5°C followed by four washes with
2× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution. Storage phosphor screens
(GE Healthcare) were exposed and scanned using a Per-
sonal Molecular Imager system (Biorad, Hercules, CA,
USA). Blots were stripped by washing with boiling 0.1%
SDS. Probe sequences used were: U6, CGTTCCAATTTT
AGTATATGTGCTGCC; miR-450a, ATATTAGGAAC
ACATCGCAAAA.

Total RNA from each stage was reverse transcribed
using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA) and random hexamers. For each
sample and target, gene expression was measured in tripli-
cate with an ABI ViiA 7 real-time PCR system using SYBR
Green (Invitrogen). We constructed standard curves and
measured efficiency for each probe using known dilutions
of pooled cDNA composed of each stage. For each sample,
gene expression was calculated from median values and
normalized to the expression of reference gene 18s riboso-
mal RNA. Probe sequences used are (forward and reverse):
18srRNA, AGTGCGGGCCATAAGCTTGCGT, GCCGT
GGGCCTCACTAAACCATCCA; Dusp10, TCGAGGA
AGCTCACCAGTGTGGGA, TAGGCGATGACGATGG
