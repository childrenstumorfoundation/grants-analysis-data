AUTHOR SUMMARY
ABSTRACT
Background: AZD1480 is a novel agent that inhibits Janus-as-
sociated kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1 and JAK2). The primary objec-
tive of this phase I study was to investigate the safety and
tolerability of AZD1480 when administered as monotherapy
to patients with solid tumors.
Methods: Thirty-eight patients with advanced malignancies
were treated at doses of 10 –70 mg once daily (QD) and 20 – 45
mg b.i.d.
Results: Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis revealed rapid ab-
sorption and elimination with minimal accumulation after
repeated QD or b.i.d. dosing. Exposure increased in a dose-
dependent manner from 10 –50 mg. Maximum plasma con-
centration (Cmax) was attained ⬃1 hour after dose, and t1/2
was ⬃5 hours. Pharmacodynamic analysis of circulating
granulocytes demonstrated maximum phosphorylated
STAT3 (pSTAT3) inhibition 1–2 hours after dose, coincident
with Cmax, and greater pSTAT3 inhibition at higher doses.
The average pSTAT3 inhibition in granulocytes at the high-
est dose tested, 70 mg QD, was 56% (standard deviation:
⫾21%) at steady-state drug levels. Dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) consisted of pleiotropic neurologic adverse events
(AEs), including dizziness, anxiety, ataxia, memory loss, hal-

profile on day 1.

lucinations, and behavior changes. These AEs were gener-
ally reversible with dose reduction or treatment cessation.
Conclusions: Whether the DLTs were due to inhibition of
JAK-1/2 or to off-target effects is unknown. The unusual DLTs
and the lack of clinical activity led to discontinuation of
development. TheOncologist2013;18:819 – 820

DISCUSSION
Constitutive activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has
been implicated in a wide variety of solid tumors, including

Phase I Study of AZD1480

prostate, head and neck, glioblastoma, colorectal, and ovar-
ian cancers [1– 6]. AZD1480 is a novel JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that
has been shown to suppress growth of solid tumor xenografts
[7]. In this phase I study, AZD1480 was administered as an oral
QD or b.i.d. monotherapy to patients with advanced solid tu-
mors at eight dose levels in the ranges of 10 –70 mg QD and
20 – 45 mg b.i.d. using a standard 3 ⫹ 3 design. AZD1480 had
fast absorption, fast elimination, and dose-dependent in-
crease in exposure from 10 mg to 50 mg. One patient, treated
at 30 mg b.i.d., submitted pre- and post-treatment tumor bi-
opsies, analysis of which showed a 50% reduction in pSTAT3,
indicating pharmacodynamic effect. There were no Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors responses. One patient
with lung cancer had stable disease for ⬎4 months (145 days).
No DLTs were noted at any of the QD doses. Based on PK anal-
ysis, b.i.d. dosing cohorts were subsequently opened. DLTs
were noted at three of the four b.i.d. dose levels. All DLTs were
neuropsychiatric in nature (dizziness, ataxia, hallucinations,
and anxiety) and were reversible in all cases but one, a case of
grade 3 anxiety. Inclusive of the DLTs, neuropsychiatric AEs of
any grade were reported by 53% of patients in the b.i.d. dosing

cohorts, with dizziness and ataxia being the most common.
The mechanism of this unusual toxicity profile is unclear. One
hypothesis is that off-target inhibition of TRKB caused the
wide range of neuropsychiatric effects observed in this trial,
based on data showing that AZD1480 is equipotent against the
TRK family (TRKA, TRKB, TRKC). TRKB is a receptor tyrosine ki-
nase with signaling activated by neurotrophins [8]. Anxious
behavior has been demonstrated in mice with inactivated
TRKB [9]. An alternate hypothesis is that the central nervous
system penetration of AZD1480 affected JAK signaling in the
brain. In rats, AZD1480 had good blood-brain barrier penetra-
tion with a brain-to-blood ratio of 0.5. At this time, there are
insufficient data to differentiate between these hypotheses.
Unfortunately, this unusual toxicity profile and overall lack of
clinical activity led to discontinuation of development of
AZD1480. JAK2 targeting remains an area of active investiga-
tion for solid tumors.
