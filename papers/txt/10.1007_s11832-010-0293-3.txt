Abstract
Purpose Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a
rare but serious disorder in children. No single approach
has clearly emerged as superior in terms of operative
procedure, ﬁxation, optimal time for surgery or adjunctive
pharmaceutical intervention. CPT is frequently associated
with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), a condition featuring
deﬁcient bone anabolism and excessive catabolism. We
have therefore combined the use of bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMP) with bisphosphonates (BP) as an adjunct to
surgical intervention.
Methods Between 2002 and 2008 we administered BMP-7
(OP-1) at the time of surgery followed by BP (pamidronate
or zoledronic acid) in eight Crawford type IV CPT cases in
seven patients (six with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of NF1) with a
median age of 7 years (range 2 years 11 months to 12 years)
at surgery.

Results
In six of eight cases, this approach led to primary
healing after a mean of 5.5 months (range 4–7 months).
One of these cases represented 17 months after primary
healing of a proximal CPT with a new further distal frac-
ture that required multiple operations to ﬁnally unite at
19 months. The two remaining cases ultimately reached
union after multiple operations at 14 and 30 months,
respectively, but required recent treatment for refractures.
Conclusion Based on these clinical data (primary healing
in 6/8 cases) and prior pre-clinical ﬁndings, we propose that
BP therapy may be helpful in preserving the BMP-induced
bone formation by inhibiting the osteoclastic bone loss. Key
factors to achieve union in CPT include sufﬁcient ﬁxation,
meticulous resection of the dysplastic tissue and the estab-
lishment of a net anabolic environment for bone healing.
Whether our biological concept of balancing the anabolic
and catabolic responses with BMP and BP improves healing
rates in the complex treatment of NF1 CPT remains
uncertain and warrants larger prospective multicentre trials.

Introduction

tibial pseudarthrosis (CPT) associated with
Congenital
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a challenging condition
to manage [1]. While CPT is an uncommon manifestation
of NF1 (2–4%), patients with NF1 make up the majority of
children that develop CPT [2]. CPT presents as a congen-
ital tibial dysplasia associated with characteristic antero-
lateral bowing. This can be associated with tapering of
the tibial diaphysis or with cystic or dysplastic lesions,

although the precise aetiology remains unclear. There is
some evidence to suggest that bone lesions or pseudar-
throsis may be associated with a localized loss of the
second NF1 allele [3], although this has not been deﬁni-
tively examined in a large study. The natural history of
CPT is progression to fracture at walking age with sub-
sequent non-union. Further management is complicated by
reduced bone healing potential in NF1 (decreased anabo-
lism) as well as susceptibility to bone resorption (increased
catabolism) [4]. Once fractured, current strategies for the
management of CPT focus on re-establishing stability and
augmenting bone healing using a range of different surgical
approaches and bone anabolic agents.

Timing of surgery is still controversial, and no speciﬁc
method for ﬁxation has evolved as clearly superior. The
published series show union rates of 60–100% and attribute
their success to various variables, such as ﬁxation of the
ﬁbula, a speciﬁc ﬁxation method or cortical bonegraft.
However, the results of small and heterogeneous patient
series are difﬁcult to compare, and all treatment strategies
have some failures or refractures. In addition, there are still
a signiﬁcant number of amputations in the long-term
studies. Consequently, there is still room for improvement!
[5–19]. There is, however, consensus that all pseudarthrotic
tissue should be resected and bone graft applied to promote
healing.

Both cancellous bone graft and, more recently, cortical
bone graft have been used as anabolic stimuli to promote
repair [8]. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic pro-
teins-2 and -7 (BMP-2 and BMP-7/OP-1) are also
employed as anabolics for the treatment of adult fractures
in speciﬁc circumstances, such as large diaphyseal defects
[20, 21]. BMP use in children is off-label, but thus far none
of the published CTP series using BMP in children have
reported any side effects, adverse events or induction or
stimulation of tumour growth [22, 23]. A paper looking at
complications of BMP in children and adolescents
reviewed 81 patients under 18 years of age [24]. However,
careful monitoring of patients following the use of potent
growth factors in the presence of a defective tumour sup-
pressor gene, such as NF1, is obligatory.

In the context of NF1/CPT treatment, a variety of results
from small case series utilizing BMP have been reported.
These range from unsuccessful, when the use of BMP-7
resulted in primary healing in only one of ﬁve cases, to
some success when primary healing occurred in ﬁve of the
seven cases involving BMP-2 and intramedullary rodding.
In the latter series, four of the seven patients had NF1, and
both non-unions were observed in these four NF1 patients,
one of whom progressed to amputation for persistent non-
union [22, 23, 25].

NF1-deﬁcient (Nf1?/-) mouse line [26]. This study also
showed a signiﬁcant increase in total BMP-induced bone
upon co-treatment with a bisphosphonate (BP), suggesting
that anti-catabolic treatments could be beneﬁcial in this
context. In a rat critical defect model, combining local
BMP administration with systemic anti-resorptive agents
signiﬁcantly increased the callus volume, strength and
bone mineral content (BMC) [27]. To date, BP represents
one of the most cost-effective and widely used bone anti-
resorptive approaches; they are able to potently inhibit
osteoclast-mediated bone catabolism. BP treatment has
been safely used in children with systemic osteopenic
conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) for many
years. In this report, we describe a series of eight CPT
cases in seven patients (six with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of
NF1). All patients were treated with a combination therapy
with BMP-7 given as an anabolic at the time of surgery and
the BP pamidronate or zoledronic acid administered post-
operatively with the aim of retaining the BMP-induced
bone.

Materials and methods

Patients

We reviewed the patient records of all NF1/CPT cases
treated between 2002 and 2008 at The Children’s Hospital
at Westmead (Sydney, Australia). The retrospective review
was approved by the local Children’s Hospital at West-
mead Human Ethics Committee. All patients were treated
with a combination of BMP-7 and BP (pamidronate and/or
zoledronic acid).

Eight CPT cases in seven patients were identiﬁed. Six of
the seven patients had a diagnosis of NF1. The patient age
at surgery ranged from 2 years 11 months to 12 years
(median 7 years). Pseudarthroses were graded using the
Crawford system: Crawford type I is described as an
anterolateral bowing of the tibia; type II as ‘‘sclerotic’’ with
an anterolateral bowing, increased cortical thickness and a
narrow intramedullary canal; type III as a ‘‘cystic’’ lesion;
type IV as a fracture or frank pseudarthrosis [28, 29]. All
cases reported here were Crawford type IV. Within the
patient cohort, one to three prior surgical procedures had
been carried out at the same pseudarthrosis site in 63%
(5/8) of the cases, and four to seven doses of BP had been
administered in 84% (7/8) of the cases, mostly in con-
junction with prior surgery.

Surgical treatment

Preclinical studies of BMP-2 have indicated a reduced
efﬁcacy in promoting new bone formation in the

pseudarthrosis tissue was meticulously removed down to

healthy appearing muscle and bone. The tibia was aligned
and stabilized with an intramedullary rod and/or Ilizarov
frame. Thereafter, the pseudarthrosis site was grafted with
a mixture of iliac crest corticocancellous bone graft and
3.5 mg rhBMP-7/OP-1 in 1 g of bovine collagen carrier
(Stryker Biotech, Hopkinton, MA). Our off-label use of
BMP-7 was approved by our local Institutional Pharmacy
Committee.

Details about the choice of intramedullary rods and/or
Ilizarov frame as well as required additional surgical pro-
cedures are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Medical treatment

Prior to the start of BP treatment, all children were assessed
by a paediatric
endocrinologist who instituted and
monitored the BP treatment. All patients had serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D, urea and creatinine concentrations
within quoted reference ranges and normal renal ultrasound
scans and were assessed by a dentist. After reports of
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) our protocol included dental
examination, and any dental work was carried out prior
to BP treatment [33]. The children were prescribed a
multivitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D per day and
calcium supplementation if their dietary calcium intake
was suboptimal. Bone mineral density (BMD) values were
determined every 6–12 months by dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) using a Lunar Prodigy apparatus
(GE Lunar Radiation Corp, Madison, WI) and evaluated by
the paediatric endocrinologist.

BP treatment commenced 2–3 weeks postoperatively
(initial dose of pamidronate 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/dose or zoled-
ronic acid 0.0125 mg/kg/dose). A lower initial dose was
given to those children who had not previously received
BP so as to limit
the side effects associated with the
ﬁrst dose. This was followed by two doses at 6–8 weeks
and further doses 3–6 months thereafter
(pamidronate
1.0–1.5 mg/kg/dose or zoledronic acid 0.025–0.05 mg/kg/
dose). Depending on their preoperative BP treatment, their
BMD values and projected surgical procedures,
the
patients received a median of two BP doses (range 1–6
doses) postoperatively.

Outcome analysis

We evaluated the pre-operative and follow-up anteropos-
terior (AP) and lateral radiographs with regards to healing
of the pseudarthrosis site, callus formation and incorpora-
tion or resorption of the bone graft and BMP-7 composite.
The primary outcomes were the best Johnston grade and
RUST (Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures)
score within 12 months of surgery. Johnston grade 1
indicates unequivocal union; grade 2, an equivocal union

with a residual transverse or longitudinal cortical deﬁ-
ciency and/or [15° deformity; grade 3, a persistent non-
union/pseudarthrosis or refracture [15]. The RUST system
scores each of the four cortices on AP and lateral radio-
graphs: a fracture line with no callus scores 1 point; callus
present but still a visible fracture line scores 2 points; and
bridging callus without evidence of a fracture line scores 3
points. The added individual scores give a total score
between 4 (deﬁnitely not healed) and 12 (deﬁnitely healed).
In the context of CPT and prior BP treatment, a fracture
line or CPT lesion may be visible even though solid union
has already been achieved. Therefore, we considered a total
score of 10 points to indicate total healing [30]. Time from
the index procedure to union as well as complications,
additional procedures and radiographic as well as func-
tional outcome at the last review (ﬁnal outcome) were
recorded.

Results

Case reports

Examples of successful and recalcitrant cases are shown in
Fig. 1 (Case 7A, primary union) and Fig. 2 (Case 6,
insufﬁcient ﬁxation). Case data are summarized in
Tables 1, 2 and 3. Key features of the individual cases are
described below.

Case 1

A 12-year-old boy with a distal CPT healed by 6 months
after resection of the pseudarthrosis, bone graft, BMP-7,
Soﬁeld rodding and Ilizarov frame, with two doses of BP.
A pin track infection was successfully treated with oral
antibiotics.

Case 2

A 2-year 11-month-old boy presented with a distal CPT
after bracing and ﬁve previous BP doses. He healed at
7 months post excision, bone graft, BMP-7 and Soﬁeld rod
transﬁxing the ankle to the calcaneus, with one further BP
dose. At age 5 years, the rod was pushed proximally to free
the ankle. Two undisplaced fractures after falls with the rod
in situ healed at age 6 and 8 years.

Case 3

An 11-year-old boy, the only patient without NF1, showed
no signs of healing in 1 year 10 months after four opera-
tions, including repeat excision of a distal CPT, two bone

graft and BMP-7 applications, Soﬁeld rodding, Ilizarov
frame and six BP doses. He ﬁnally healed with 5 cm
shortening and a stiff ankle after a total of 2 years
6 months (8 months after repeat excision and Ilizarov bone
transport with distal tibial chondrodiastasis). After a fur-
ther 2 years 4 months he re-presented with a refracture
after a fall, required surgery with rodding through the ankle
and was healing at the time that this report was being
written.

Case 4

A 7-year-old girl presented with a distal CPT after three
previous operations and seven previous BP doses. She went
on to union 4 months post-excision, bone graft, BMP-7,
Soﬁeld rodding and Ilizarov compression, with two further
BP doses. Within 1 month following union of the pseud-
arthrosis, a 5-cm Ilizarov lengthening was done over the
rod, which healed without complications.

Case 5

A 10-year-old boy presented with a CPT of the proximal
tibial shaft after three previous surgeries with bone grafting
and four previous BP doses. He healed by 5 months post-
resection of the pseudarthrosis, bone graft, BMP-7, Ilizarov
and three BP doses.

At age 12 years he re-presented with a new distal frac-
ture in the same tibia. The previously treated proximal
pseudarthrosis site still showed solid union. The new
fracture was treated with a telescoping Fassier-Duval (FD)
rod, bone graft, BMP-7 and one dose of BP. The bone graft
was only partially resorbed but failed to unite at 5 months
and thus was re-grafted with BMP-7. No further BP was
given due to the high number of previous BP doses and a
lumbar spine BMD Z-score of ?2.9.

Over the following 9 months the rod gradually collapsed
(‘‘negative telescoping’’) and then protruded into the ankle.
The telescoping rod was exchanged for a locked humeral
nail and bone graft with BMP-7 applied for a third time.
Healing was achieved at 2 months after this third operation
with retention of the bone graft and bridging callus.

Case 6

A 5-year-old girl with a distal CPT after one previous
operation and four previous BP doses was treated with
excision, bone graft, BMP-7, a telescoping FD rod and two
further BP doses. Persistent non-union warranted two
additional bone grafting procedures (the ﬁrst with BMP-7)
at 4 and 9 months. The bone graft was mainly retained, but
only after adding stability with an Ilizarov frame at
12 months, union was achieved 6 weeks thereafter (Fig. 2).

Discussion

In this paper we report on a series of eight CPT cases in
seven patients
treated with an anabolic/anti-catabolic
approach using adjunctive BMP/BP pharmacotherapy. The
choice of BMP-7 over BMP-2 was one of availability at
our centre. Patients were treated post-operatively with the
BP pamidronate or zoledronic acid for the purpose of
maintaining BMP-7-induced bone. With this strategy, we
achieved rapid primary union in 75% of cases (6/8) at a
mean of 5.5 months (range 4–7 months) (Fig. 1). Further-
more, all cases eventually healed, which compares
favourably with the literature, even though both of our
cases that failed primary union required recent surgery for
refractures. Retrospective examination of the two recalci-
trant cases revealed that both cases lacked stable ﬁxation of
the short distal tibial segment. Bone graft and callus had
been retained after intervention with BMP/BP, but tele-
scopic rod ﬁxation alone was insufﬁcient to achieve union
and later failed to prevent a refracture (Fig. 2). After
improving stability to the short distal tibial segment with an
Ilizarov frame, it went on to unite, but refractured 5 months
after removal of the frame.

This study focuses on achieving union and has sufﬁcient
follow-up to account for early complications, re-operations
and refractures. However, achieving union is only the start
of a successful treatment path, which includes controlling
leg length inequality and deformity and maintaining robust
union to skeletal maturity and, most importantly, sound
limb function.

In terms of systematic evaluation of BMP/BP therapy,
this study has several limitations. The study is retrospective
and shows a wide heterogeneity of ages and ﬁxation
technique and no standardization in BP intervention. This
is reﬂective of the evolution of a treatment strategy over 8
years. Nevertheless, these experiences have been extremely
informative at our centre and continue to guide practice.
CPT is a relatively uncommon, albeit serious condition
and, in the context of NF1 CPT, the sample size of eight
cases represents a substantial patient cohort. However, the
results of diverse and often complex treatment strategies
applied to small and heterogeneous patient series are dif-
ﬁcult to compare, and thus conclusions regarding long-term
beneﬁts of isolated treatment factors must be guarded.

There is a strong theoretical basis for our strategy of
balancing anabolism and catabolism by adding an anti-
resorptive agent to BMP. However, in our experience, all

successfully united cases required stable ﬁxation of the
distal tibial fragment. We therefore postulate that treatment
success in CPT is multifactorial. Key factors that appear to
be required to achieve union include adequate ﬁxation,
meticulous resection of all dysplastic tissue and the
establishment of a net anabolic environment with bone
graft and possibly adjunctive pharmaceuticals, such as
BMP and BP.

Our own preclinical studies of BMP-2-induced hetero-
topic bone formation in NF1-deﬁcient mice (Nf1?/-) have
illustrated the advantages of BP therapy. Zoledronic acid
co-treatment produced a ﬁvefold increase in BMD and a
fourfold increase in bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV)
after BMP/BP co-treatment when compared to BMP-2
alone [26]. These ﬁndings indicate that BMP may be
functional but less effective in an NF1 setting and strongly
suggest that further adjunctive approaches may be advan-
tageous. The clinical case series of Lee et al. supports these
ﬁnding, with the bone graft mostly resorbed and just one of
ﬁve cases healed within 1 year after BMP-7 alone [23].

In contrast, a recent study reported primary healing after
Williams rodding and BMP-2 alone in ﬁve of seven cases
of CPT. Only four of the seven patients had a conﬁrmed
diagnosis of NF1, and both non-unions were observed in
NF1 patients (50% success rate in NF1 only). One of these
cases, notably with the highest dose of BMP-2 in the whole
series, led to a persistent non-union that required a below-
knee amputation [22]. It is possible that CPT is even more
difﬁcult to treat when associated with NF1. As previously
mentioned, it is extremely difﬁcult to compare a small
heterogeneous patient series, and it is even more difﬁcult to
prove any causality. At this point, the relative merits of
BMP-2 or BMP-7 in this disease remain to be investigated.
In our series, the short-term BP treatment commenced
2–4 weeks after surgery, once the callus was formed. This
was based on pre-clinical data from rat closed fracture and
critical defect models where the best results in terms of
callus size and mechanical strength were achieved when
the BP treatment was delayed for 2 weeks [27, 31]. A
recent report of children treated with BP over a period of
1 to 1 year 6 months for localized bone disorders, such as
avascular necrosis or Perthes disease of the hip, showed no
adverse affect on growth and no cases of fractures asso-
ciated with increased bone density or ONJ [32]. One seri-
ous complication of BP is ONJ, which usually occurs after
high-dose treatment for malignancy, with the highest rates
in myeloma and breast cancer patients [33]. No cases of
ONJ have been reported in children to date, but routine
dental examination prior to commencing on BP therapy is a
common sensible precaution we follow to minimize the
need for dental surgery during BP therapy. The concerns
about BP-related inhibition of fracture repair only seems to
apply to patients on very long-term BP therapy that may

123

516

result in reduced bone turnover affecting both anabolic and
catabolic responses [34, 35]. All of our CPT cases treated
with BMP and BP eventually healed and remodelled
(Fig. 1). Furthermore, we did not observe signs or a cor-
relation between high numbers of previous BP doses with
delayed or increased time to union. We therefore con-
cluded that the described short-term BP regime is safe to
use in CPT.

Conclusion

The combined use of BMP and BP may be helpful in
preserving the BMP-induced bone formation by inhibiting
osteoclastic bone loss. Care should be taken to ensure
mechanically stable ﬁxation, particularly of the small distal
tibial segment. Whether or not this biological concept of
enhanced anabolism and inhibition of catabolism translates
into improved healing rates in the complex treatment
puzzle of CPT remains to be investigated with larger pro-
spective multicentre trials.
