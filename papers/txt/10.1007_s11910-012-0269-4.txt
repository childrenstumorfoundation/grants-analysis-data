Abstract Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous scle-
rosis complex (TSC) are autosomal-dominant genetic disor-
ders that result from dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. NF1 is
caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome
17q11.2. Its protein product, neurofibromin, functions as a
tumor suppressor and ultimately produces constitutive upre-
gulation of mTOR. TSC is caused by mutations in either the
TSC1 (chromosome 9q34) or TSC2 (chromosome 16p.13.3)
genes. Their protein products, hamartin and tuberin, respec-
tively, form a dimer that acts via the GAP protein Rheb (Ras
homolog enhanced in brain) to directly inhibit mTOR, again
resulting in upregulation. Specific inhibitors of mTOR are in
clinical use, including sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus,
and deforolimus. Everolimus has been shown to reduce the
volume and appearance of subependymal giant cell astrocy-
tomas (SEGA), facial angiofibromas, and renal angiomyoli-
pomas associated with TSC, with a recent FDA approval for
SEGA not suitable for surgical resection. This article reviews
the use of mTOR inhibitors in these diseases, which have the
potential to be a disease-modifying therapy in these and other
conditions.

Introduction

Cure rates for most pediatric cancers have been increasing
over the past several decades [1–4]; however, recently,
survival rates have not continued to rise, possibly reflect-
ing that current chemotherapeutic doses have been max-
imized. For patients with refractory acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) or solid tumors,
the development of
novel, biologically targeted treatment strategies is crucial.
These rather different diagnoses have a common pathway
that is dysregulated or aberrantly expressed through the
PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway [5–10].

mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as a central
cellular regulator of many functions, including proliferation,
cell size/growth, translation, metabolism, autophagy, angio-
genesis, and survival by responding to the availability of
nutrients (glucose, amino acids), as illustrated in Fig. 1 [11].
mTOR exerts control on these processes by regulating the
protein translation machinery, which increases the synthesis
of nutrient and amino acids transporters as well as key pro-
growth and survival molecules (eg, HIF-1a, cyclin D1, and
myc) [12]. mTOR combines with several other cellular com-
ponents to form two distinct complexes, termed mTORC1 and
mTORC2 [13]. mTORC1 is thought to primarily regulate cell
growth, translation, and autophagy in response to nutrient and
energy availability via phosphorylation of its downstream
targets, including S6K1, p34cdc2, and 4E-BP1. mTORC2
plays a key role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell sur-
vival. Phosphorylation by mTORC2 in conjunction with

The diagnosis of NF1 is clinical and based on criteria
developed at the National Institutes of Health consensus
conference (Table 1) [17]. NF1 is characterized by diverse,
progressive cutaneous, neurological, skeletal, and neoplastic
manifestations, with no standard drug treatment options
available. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of de-
veloping both benign and malignant tumors of the central
and peripheral nervous system including plexiform neuro-
fibromas (27%), optic gliomas (15–20%), pheochromocyto-
mas (1%), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs) (10%) [15, 18]. MPNSTs can arise in patients
with or without NF1, but in patients with NF1 they tend to
occur earlier (2nd and 3rd decade of life) and have a poorer
response to therapy and, therefore, a worse prognosis [19].
The lifetime risk of developing MPNSTs in patients with
NF1 is 8–13% [20]. MPNSTs can arise spontaneously or by
malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibroma.

There are multiple types of neurofibromas including lo-
calized cutaneous, localized intraneuronal, diffuse, massive
soft tissue, and plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neuro-
fibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that grow along the
length of nerves and involve multiple branches of a nerve.
These tumors are usually diagnosed early in life, may be
multiple, and can develop throughout life. Early childhood,
puberty, and childbearing age in females are considered to
be the periods of greatest risk for disease progression [21].
Between 20 and 44% of individuals with NF1 develop
plexiform neurofibromas [22]. While considered “benign,”
these tumors may cause significant disfigurement, as well as
compression of vital structures. For example, plexiform
neurofibromas may infiltrate the orbit, displace the globe,
and compromise vision; paraspinal tumors (also referred to
as dumbbell lesions) can compress the spinal cord and cause
paralysis; tumors in mediastinum may compress the trachea
or great vessels; and tumors of the extremities can cause
local nerve infiltration, progressive neurologic deficit, and
often cause unremitting pain [21].

Plexiform neurofibromas, including paraspinal neurofibro-
mas, cause major morbidity and mortality in NF1 [18, 23, 24].
The rate of growth of this histologically benign neoplasm has
been described as unpredictable and often episodic [15], and
the only known cure of these tumors is complete surgical
excision. However, complete excision is often not possible
due to the infiltrating nature of these tumors. In addition, up
to 44% of tumors progress after the first surgery, most com-
monly in patients younger than 10 years of age with head and
neck tumors that could not be completely resected [21]. Also,
the complex, infiltrating nature of plexiform neurofibromas can
make tumor growth difficult to detect without the use of mag-
netic resonance imaging with three-dimensional volumetric
analysis, a technology not widely available [25].

Patients with NF1 offer unique challenges to the design
of clinical trials to test new medications for plexiform

Fig. 1 Major components of the mTOR pathway and associated diseases.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists as two complexes
(mTORC1 and mTORC2), of which only mTORC1 is inhibited by
rapamycin and related compounds. mTOR is a central regulator that senses
when a cell is in an appropriate bioenergetic state before committing to cell
growth and division. Insulin, hormones, growth factors as well as the
availability of carbohydrates (CHO) and amino acids stimulate mTORC1
through activation of PI3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt (also known as protein
kinase B) via IRS-1. The energy status (AMP/ATP ratio driven by mito-
chondrial signals) of the cell modulates mTORC1 via AMP protein kinase
(AMPK) and the TSC1/2 complex. Upregulation of mTORC1 activates
S6 kinase1 (S6K1) and ribosomal S6 kinase (rS6), and inhibits eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E (elF4E), which results in cell proliferation, increased
transcription of genes, which regulate cell metabolism and proliferation, an
increase in ribosomal protein synthesis, cap-dependent translation, eEF2-
mediated elongation, and promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements. Con-
versely, activated mTORC1 blocks apoptosis and autophagy. HIF—hyp-
oxia-inducible factors; LKB1—liver kinase B1; PTEN—phosphorylase
on chromosome 10; Rheb—Ras homolog enhanced in brain

phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 is necessary to fully ac-
tivate AKT [14]. This review looks at the genetics and clinical
implications of mutations disrupting mTOR signaling in two
autosomal-dominant genetic disorders, neurofibromatosis type
1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and evidence
for the utility of pharmaceutical agents that target the mTOR
pathway for treating them.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1

NF1 is a progressive disorder with an incidence of 1:3500
[15] that is caused by a mutation in the NF1 tumor suppres-
sor gene, located on chromosome 17q11.2 and comprised of
60 exons spanning 350 kb of genomic DNA. Mutation
analysis of the NF1 gene allows identification of 95% of
mutations with a wide spectrum of mutations [16]. To date,
no phenotype-genotype correlations have been made with
the exception of complete loss of the NF1 gene (megabase
deletions), which is associated with severe mental
retardation.

neurofibromas. First, plexiform neurofibromas may not
change appreciably for 12–18 months without any interven-
tion, which means that trials must treat patients for long
periods before benefit can be detected. In addition, treating a
patient with a benign condition on new drugs with which we
have minimal experience is a risk most are reasonably
unwilling to take. A number of medical treatments including
thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, interferon α-2b, methotrexate
and vinblastine, the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib
(R115777), and the antifibrotic agent pirfenidone have been
evaluated in NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas
with the goal of reducing the size or growth of these tumors
[26–28]. However, to date, no medical treatment has dem-
onstrated a clear benefit for patients with NF1 and plexiform
neurofibromas.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

TSC is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized by
growth of hamartomas in multiple organs, including the lung,
kidney, and skin [29–31]. About 70–85% of individuals who
have a definitive diagnosis of TSC have an identifiable TSC1
or TSC2 mutation [29, 32, 33]. TSC1, located on chromosome
9q34, encodes the protein hamartin; TSC2, located on chro-
mosome 16p13.3, encodes tuberin. TSC2 mutations are pres-
ent in 70–80% of affected individuals and are consistently
associated with more severe clinical disease, whereas TSC1
mutations are only present in 20–30% of individuals.

Affecting both adults and children, TSC is inherited in an
autosomal-dominant fashion, but it occurs sporadically in
two thirds of cases [29]. The true prevalence of TSC is
unknown; however, it is estimated at 1:6000–10,000 and it
currently affects 1.5 million people worldwide [32, 34, 35].
A wide variation exists in the level of disease severity and,
in fact, some patients with TSC remain asymptomatic. As
such, the diagnostic criteria for TSC consist of a set of major

and minor features that guide the level of probability of
disease into definite, probable, or possible categories (Table 2)
[36]. Virtually any organ system can be affected in patients
with TSC, but the disease is most commonly characterized by
central nervous system (CNS) manifestations and by the pres-
ence of hamartomatous lesions in other organs. Although
historically thought to be benign, recent evidence suggests
that hamartomas may have an underlying neoplastic nature
[37]. In particular, a variant of angiomyolipoma (AML),
called epithelioid AML, is an extremely aggressive tumor
[38].

Anatomic and functional abnormalities of the CNS that
result in neurologic dysfunction contribute significantly to
morbidity and mortality in patients with TSC. Brain lesions
include cortical tubers, subependymal nodules (SENs), and
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Cortical
tubers are found in 80–90% of patients [29, 32] and are
associated with seizures and developmental delays [39–41],
and consequently represent an area of high interest for
further research. Tubers and the surrounding cortex may
have to be surgically removed, often successfully, to treat
patients with intractable epilepsy [41, 42]. SENs occur in
about 90% of patients with TSC, and are asymptomatic nod-
ular lesions that extend into the ventricles of the CNS. SENs
usually remain dormant but have the potential to increase in
size and develop into SEGAs [43]. SEGAs are slow-growing,
glioneuronal tumors that develop in approximately 5–20% of
patients [29, 44, 45]. SEGAs generally develop adjacent to the
foramen of Monro and may remain clinically benign until they
reach sufficient size to cause ventricular obstruction. Once this
occurs, the potential for sudden death secondary to acute
hydrocephalus is increased [43, 44]. SEGAs may also produce
visual impairment, endocrinopathies, and focal neurologic
deficits. SEGAs are often large and difficult to resect once
they produce clinical symptoms.

A hallmark of TSC is epilepsy, which can be seen in up to
90% of patients. Epilepsy tends to increase in severity with

age and usually is difficult to control [32, 46]. Although
complex partial seizures are most commonly observed, most
seizure types can occur [35, 47]. A particularly devastating
type of seizure, infantile spasms (also known as West syn-
drome), is seen in approximately one third of very young
children with TSC with usual onset during the first year of
life [47, 48]. The seizures generally stop by about age
5 years, but may be replaced by other seizure types. If not
controlled, infantile spasms are associated with severe devel-
opmental delay and cognitive impairment. Developmental

and behavioral difficulties, including mental retardation,
learning disabilities, psychiatric disorders, cognitive impair-
ment, autism, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are
also common in patients with TSC [32, 43, 46, 49–52].

The majority (90%) of patients with TSC have skin
involvement [29, 30]. The hallmark lesion is the ash leaf
macule, an ovoid hypopigmented lesion most noticeable in
dark-skinned individuals or those with sun exposure. Af-
fected individuals also develop cutaneous fibromas, which
have a predilection for the face (angiofibromas, previously
adenoma sebaceum), periungual tissue, lower back, and
gingivae. Nonpharmaceutical therapies such as laser abla-
tion or surgical resection are the standard therapies for TSC-
associated skin lesions [53].

Renal AMLs are the second leading cause of death in
patients with TSC, occur in approximately 75% of patients,
and usually present with multiple lesions in both kidneys [29,
54]. Tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter are more likely to
become symptomatic with potentially life-threatening hemor-
rhage, and are usually slated for treatment with nephron-
sparing prophylactic selective arterial embolization or radio-
frequency ablation [54, 55]. Nephrectomy is reserved for mul-
tiple large tumors that involve most of the kidney and are not
amenable to embolization.

Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is the third
leading cause of death in patients with TSC and occurs almost
exclusively in premenopausal females [29, 32]. Although
40% of females with TSC show radiographic evidence of
LAM, only about 5% of patients are functionally affected,
but in these patients the disorder is almost invariably fatal [52,
54]. Currently, there is no effective treatment for LAM; in
addition to symptomatic treatment, progesterone has been
administered (due to the presumed involvement of hormones
in the pathogenesis of LAM) with variable success [29, 53,
56]. Lung transplantation is reserved for patients with respi-
ratory failure.

Other common lesions include cardiac rhabdomyomas
and retinal lesions [30, 57, 58]. TSC-related cardiac rhabdo-
myomas generally regress with increasing age; therefore,
treatment of this lesion is rarely required [53]. For symp-
tomatic treatment of visual impairment, standard treatment
options are photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy.

Genetics of TSC and NF1: Role of the mTOR Pathway

The NF1 gene encodes a protein, termed neurofibromin,
which functions partly as a Ras-GTPase activating protein
(RasGAP). Neurofibromin loss in tumor cells leads to
hyperactivation of Ras and its downstream signaling inter-
mediates, which are critical for transmitting the Ras growth
signal and thus the development of neoplasia in patients
with NF1. One of these downstream proteins is the mTOR

298

molecule, which was found to be activated in both NF1-
deficient primary human and mouse cells as well as in
human and genetically engineered Nf1 mouse tumor mod-
els. This aberrant activation was dependent on Ras and PI3
kinase/AKT signaling [6, 7]. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus
was shown to dramatically reduce the increased prolifera-
tion associated with loss of neurofibromin expression in
human MPNST cell lines; and in a genetic mouse model
of NF1-deficient MPNST development, sirolimus completely
inhibited the growth of these tumors in vivo [6].

Mice carrying compound mutations in the NF-1 and p53
tumor suppressors on the same chromosome (NPcis animals)
develop aggressive MPNSTs that are histologically indistin-
guishable from human tumors with an average latency of
5 months. These lesions develop as a result of somatic loss
of the wild-type Nf1 and p53 alleles, and therefore are also
genetically similar to human MPNSTs. NPcis mice with pal-
pable tumors (approximately 300 mm3) that were treated with
sirolimus had significantly improved survival and tumor
shrinkage compared to control mice [59].

These findings identify the NF-1 tumor suppressor as a
negative regulator of mTOR, and demonstrate that sirolimus
blocks the growth of several NF1-deficient cells and tumor
cell types in vitro and in vivo. The combination of cell
culture and preclinical mouse modeling data provides a
strong rationale for the use of sirolimus in treating human
NF1-associated tumors.

In the case of TSC, the normal TSC1 and TSC2 proteins
form a complex in cells to function as a GTPase-activating
protein toward Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) [60,
61]. Through Rheb, the TSC1/TSC2 protein (hamartin-
tuberin) complex limits the activation of mTOR. Mutation
of the TSC1 and/or TSC2 genes leads to a deficient
hamartin-tuberin complex, and results in constitutive acti-
vation of mTOR leading to hyperactive mTOR signaling
and abnormal cell division.

Evidence from in vitro, in murine models, and in humans
indicates that a wide spectrum of TSC1/TSC2 mutations
resulting in mTOR hyperactivity is responsible for the de-
velopmental abnormalities in the brain that occur in patients
with TSC. Developing neurons acquire an abnormal mor-
phology, with large cell bodies, multiple axons, and few,
large, dendritic spines, decreased myelin, and abnormal
synaptic architecture [40, 62–68]. Increased neuronal pro-
liferation and aberrant neuronal migration lead to abnormal
cortical architecture [29, 65–67]. Developing glial cells have
also exhibited an abnormal morphology and increased
growth and proliferation [40, 66, 69, 70].

Evidence from murine models suggests that mTOR inhibi-
tion may be able to at least partly correct abnormal synaptic
transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal excitability,
and thereby has the potential to prevent progression or devel-
opment of neurologic dysfunction, including epilepsy and

cognitive/behavioral dysfunction in patients with TSC [49,
66, 71–74].

Clinical Trials Evaluating mTOR Inhibition in NF1
and TSC

There are agents currently available and others under preclin-
ical and clinical development that target signaling nodes within
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [10, 23, 75, 76]. Rapamycin
and its rapalogs (eg, everolimus, deforolimus, and temsiroli-
mus) are allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, whereas mTORC2
is generally resistant to rapalogs, but this resistance may vary
by cell type [77–79]. Rapamycin (sirolimus) was isolated from
the bacterial strain Streptomyces hygroscopicus found in the
soil on Easter Island (“Rapa Nui” in the island’s native lan-
guage) [80]. While its anti-neoplastic properties were identi-
fied early on, rapamycin was not further developed for this
indication because of its variable bioavailability and its aque-
ous insolubility [80]. Rapamycin is also an effective immuno-
suppressant and is currently US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved as an anti-rejection medication in solid organ
and bone marrow transplants [81].

There are several ongoing clinical trials involving phar-
macologic inhibition of mTOR in patients with NF1. The
US Department of Defense (DOD) funded Neurofibroma
(NF) Consortium is currently conducting a trial of the oral
mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for children and adults with NF1-
associated plexiform neurofibromas. The DOD NF Consor-
tium is also conducting a trial of the oral mTOR inhibitor
everolimus for children with NF1 and chemotherapy-
refractory progressive low-grade gliomas (optic pathway
gliomas). Everolimus is one of the second-generation, aque-
ous rapalogs with much improved bioavailability compared
to sirolimus. These trials are ongoing and thus no published
results are available.

A clinical series has demonstrated responses to single-
agent sirolimus in SEGAs and a low-grade glioma in five
pediatric patients with TSC [82]. Everolimus has demonstrat-
ed significant reductions in tumor volume in SEGAs associ-
ated with TSC, which led to the approval of the drug by the
FDA for this indication [83, 84]. Primary SEGA volume, as
assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline
vs 6 months), was reduced by ≥30% in 21 patients (75%) and
at least 50% in 9 patients (32%) [83]. There were no new
lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased in-
tracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other
therapy for SEGAs. In addition, a marked reduction in seizure
frequency was seen [83].

Some early clinical trials suggest that mTOR inhibitors
effectively and safely treat TSC-associated renal lesions by
causing tumor regression when on active treatment [30, 72,
85–88]. Although no data exist for the use of mTOR inhibitors

Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep (2012) 12:294–301

299

in the treatment of cardiac rhabdomyomas, abnormalities in
the mTOR signaling pathway have been confirmed [89, 90].
Therefore, it is plausible that an mTOR inhibitor may be used
to treat cardiac rhabdomyoma. Some suggest that mTOR
inhibitors also may have a role in the treatment of angiofi-
broma, as small and early-phase clinical trials have demon-
strated some regression in these lesions [87].

Conclusions

To date, treatment options for patients with NF1 or TSC have
been limited and have demonstrated variable rates of success.
In both NF1 and TSC, neurofibromin and the hamartin/tuberin
complex, respectively, act as “molecular brakes” limiting ac-
tivation of downstream signaling intermediates. mTOR, a
common downstream intermediate to both neurofibromin
and hamartin/tuberin, appears to play an integral role in the
development of NF1 and TSC and their complications. Pre-
clinical data and early clinical trials have demonstrated a
beneficial effect of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of sev-
eral clinical manifestations of TSC, including SEGA and renal
AML volume, epilepsy, and skin lesions. Ongoing clinical
trials evaluating sirolimus and everolimus in NF1 will evalu-
ate the potential role of these agents for treating this condition.
Inhibition of mTOR is a rational target and has the potential to
change the paradigm of how patients are treated.
