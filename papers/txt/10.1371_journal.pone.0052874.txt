Abstract

Ras is a signaling protein involved in a variety of cellular processes. Hence, studying Ras signaling with high spatiotemporal
resolution is crucial to understanding the roles of Ras in many important cellular functions. Previously, fluorescence lifetime
imaging (FLIM) of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ras activity sensors, FRas and FRas-F, have been
demonstrated to be useful for measuring the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras signaling in subcellular micro-compartments.
However the predominantly nuclear localization of the sensors’ acceptor has limited its sensitivity. Here, we have overcome
this limitation and developed two variants of the existing FRas sensor with different affinities: FRas2-F (Kd,1.7 mM) and
FRas2-M (Kd,0.5 mM). We demonstrate that, under 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, FRas2 sensors
provide higher sensitivity compared to previous sensors in 293T cells and neurons.

Introduction

from membrane receptors

Ras is a member of a large family of small GTPase proteins that
bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
into
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) [1]. Major subtypes include H-,
N- and K-Ras, and all of these subtypes express ubiquitously [1].
Ras is important in transducing a wide range of extracellular
signaling
signals
to intracellular
cascades [2,3] that regulate many cellular processes,
including
cell cycle progression, differentiation and survival [3,4]. When
bound to GTP, Ras is active and able to bind and activate
downstream effectors; whereas when bound to GDP, it is inactive
[5]. In neurons, Ras plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity,
neuronal morphogenesis, and learning and memory [1,6–8]. Tight
spatiotemporal
to the
activation of specific signaling pathways in order to achieve
appropriate biological outcomes [2,9]. Therefore, it is crucial to
measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras
signaling to
understand how it regulates its diverse downstream targets.

regulation of Ras activity is central

In order to image intracellular signaling activity, many sensors
based on FRET have been developed [10]. Because FRET
strongly depends on the distance between the donor and acceptor,
FRET can be used as a readout of protein-protein interactions for
proteins fused to fluorophores [11]. A FRET based sensor called
‘‘Ras and interacting protein chimeric unit’’ (Raichu) enabled the
measurement of the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras activity in
live cells [12]. Raichu consists of a fusion of enhanced yellow
fluorescent protein (EYFP), HRas without the CAAX membrane
targeting sequence, Ras binding domain of Raf1 (RBD), enhanced
cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), and KRas CAAX in a single

polypeptide [12]. In the inactive GDP-bound form, ECFP and
EYFP are located away from each other, thereby resulting in low
FRET. Following Ras activation, RBD associates with active Ras.
This brings ECFP and EYFP into close proximity,
thereby
increasing FRET [12].

two components: HRas

Recently, a more sensitive imaging method based on FLIM in
combination with a FRET-based Ras sensor optimized for FLIM,
FRas, has been developed [13]. With this sensor, signaling activity
in small subcellular compartments was quantified [13]. FRas is
made of
tagged with monomeric
enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP-HRas) and RBD
tagged on each end with monomeric red fluorescent proteins
(mRFP-RBD-mRFP) (Figure 1A). When mEGFP-Ras is activated,
increasing FRET
mRFP-RBD-mRFP binds to mEGFP-HRas,
[13]. While FRas provided high sensitivity,
the high affinity
between HRas and RBD slowed Ras inactivation by inhibiting its
interaction with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) [13]. To
address this problem, a mutation (R59A) was introduced in RBD
to decrease the affinity between Ras and RBD to create FRas-F,
the Ras sensor with fast inactivation kinetics [13,14].

While it has been demonstrated that the sensitivity of FRas-F is
sufficiently high for imaging Ras signaling in small subcellular
compartments such as dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons [13],
we found that the acceptor of the sensor (mRFP-RBDR59A-mRFP)
accumulates in the nucleus,
limiting the sensitivity of the Ras
sensor. In this paper, we identify the sequence in RBD that causes
nuclear localization and introduce a point mutation to generate a
new sensor, FRas2-F, which overcomes this problem. In addition,
we develop a FRas2 variant, FRas2-M, with slightly increased

DNA Constructs

The constructs pCI-mEGFP-HRas, pCI-mRFP-RBD-mRFP
and pCI-mRFP-RBDR59A-mRFP were previously described [13].
Point mutations were introduced in the original pCI-mRFP-
RBDR59A-mRFP or pCI-mRFP-RBD-mRFP to produce pCI-
mRFP-RBDR59A,K108A-mRFP and pCI-mRFP-RBDK65E,K108A-
mRFP, respectively.

Protein Purification

Polyhistidine (His6)-superfolder GFP (sfGFP)-HRas without the
C-terminal CAAX membrane targeting sequence [15] and His6-
mRFP–RBD mutants were cloned into the pET bacterial
expression vector. Proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli

Measurements of the Affinity Between HRas and RBD

Purified sfGFP-HRas (without the CAAX membrane targeting
sequence) was loaded with 25-fold molar excess of 29,39-O-N-
methyl anthraniloyl–GppNHp (Gpp(NH)p) and GDP by incubat-
ing in the presence of 15 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) for 30 min at 37uC. Then, 10 mM MgCl2 was added to
the reaction [18]. The excess amount of Gpp(NH)p and GDP was
removed with a desalting column (GE Healthcare). SfGFP-HRas
and mRFP-RBD (or its mutants) were mixed and incubated at
room temperature for 30 min. FRET between sfGFP and mRFP
was quantified with fluorescence lifetime measurement. To obtain
the fluorescence lifetime of
its fluorescence

with the Gaussian pulse response function:

Cell Culture and Transfection

293T cells (ATCC #: CRL-11268) were cultured in Dubelco’s
modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37uC in 5% CO2, and transfected with
plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Approximately
16–18 hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with
DMEM with low FBS (0.5%)
for 8 hours, and subjected to
imaging in a solution containing 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.3),
130 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
2 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 25 mM glucose [19].
The cells were stimulated by applying 100 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (EGF).

Cortical neurons were prepared from newborn Sprague Dawley
rats at postnatal day 0 as described previously [20,21] and cultured
in basal medium eagle (BME) supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 35 mM
glucose, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin. Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 mM) was added to the
cultures at days in vitro (DIV) 2 to inhibit the proliferation of non-
neuronal cells. Cells were transfected at DIV 3 using Lipofecta-
mine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously [22]. The cells
were imaged at DIV 5–6 in the culture medium, and stimulated
with 100 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

2-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy

A custom-built 2-photon microscope equipped with a Ti:sap-
phire pulsed laser (MaiTai; Spectra-Physics, Fremont, CA) tuned
at 920 nm and a mode-locked Ytterbium-doped laser (1030 nm;
Amplitude Syste`mes, Bordeaux, France) were used for imaging
mEGFP and mRFP distribution, respectively, in 293T cells. The
intensity of each laser beam was independently controlled with
electro-optical modulators (350-80 LA; Conoptics, Danbury, CT).
The two laser beams were combined using a beam-splitting cube
and passed through the same set of galvano-scanning mirrors and
objective (606, 0.9 NA; Olympus, Melville, NY). Imaging of
dissociated cultures of cortical neurons were performed on a
different custom-built two-photon microscope with a Ti:sapphire
pulsed laser (MaiTai; Spectra-Physics, Fremont, CA) tuned to
920 nm for imaging of mEGFP- and mRFP-tagged constructs.
Fluorescence was divided with a dichroic mirror
(565 nm;
Chroma) and detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs; H7422-
40 (Hamamatsu)
for red) after
wavelength filters (HQ510/70-2p for green and HQ620/90-2p for
red; Chroma Techonology, Brattleboro, VT) [23]. Fluorescence
signal was acquired by ScanImage [24] using a data acquisition
board (PCI-6110, National Instruments). Fluorescence lifetime
images were acquired using a time-correlated single photon
counting board (SPC-150; Becker-Hickl) controlled with a custom
software integrated into ScanImage [13,25].

Results

localized at

When 293T cells were transfected with FRas-F (Figure 1C), we
observed that mEGFP-HRas was
the plasma
membrane and internal membranes (Figure 1C), similarly to
endogenous HRas [26]. However, we consistently found that the
(mRFP-RBDR59A-mRFP) was concentrated in the
acceptor
nucleus, with relatively low expression in the cytosol (Figure 1C).
This localization likely limits the sensitivity of the FRas-F sensor by
effectively reducing the concentration of RBD in the cytosol.
Therefore, we searched for the reason behind the nuclear
accumulation of RBD. Upon analysis of the RBD sequence, we
detected a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in RBD (Figure 1B,
gray box). To disrupt the NLS, we introduced a K108A mutation
in the RBD sequence (Figure 1B, in red). As expected, RBDs with
the K108A mutation (RBDR59A,K108A) show cytosolic localization
(Figure 1C). We named this FRas-F variant FRas2-F. In addition,
based on a previous study reporting the affinity of several different
RBD mutants [14], we developed another FRas2 variant with an
intermediate affinity to HRas (lower than FRas and higher than
FRas-F), FRas2-M, by replacing the ‘‘F’’ mutation R59A with
K65E (RBDK65E,K108A) (Figure 1B).

To further characterize the effect of the K108A mutation on the
affinity between Ras and RBD, we measured the affinity between
purified sfGFP-HRas without the CAAX membrane targeting
sequence and mRFP-RBD or its mutations in the presence of
either non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (Gpp(NH)p) or GDP using
fluorescence lifetime measurements in a cuvette (Figure 1D;
Table 1). We found that the effect of K108A on the affinity of

To test the sensitivity of FRas2 variants (FRas2-F and FRas2-M)
compared to that of FRas and FRas-F, we transfected these Ras
FRET sensors in 293T cells, and imaged them with 2-photon
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM) (Figure 2). To
activate Ras in 293T cells, we measured Ras activation in response
to bath application of EGF [13,27]. As reported [13], application
of EGF (100 ng/ml) increased the binding between mRFP-RBD-
mRFP and mEGFP-HRas,

(Figure 2A–B). FRas2-F shows higher binding fraction than
FRas-F both before and after EGF stimulation, presumably due to
higher acceptor concentration in the cytosol
(Figure 2A–B).
Further, FRas2-M showed a greater increase in binding fraction
after EGF application compared to other sensors (Figure 2A–B).
Thus, these results indicate that the new FRas2-M sensor has
improved sensitivity.

Since Ras signaling is important for many forms of neuronal
plasticity and development [1,6–8], we tested the sensitivity of
FRas-F, FRas2-F and FRas2-M in neurons. We transfected
primary cultures of cortical neurons with these sensors and
imaged them with 2pFLIM [13]. The acceptor of FRas-F (mRFP-
RBDR59A-mRFP) was
strongly accumulated in the nucleus
(Figure 3A). In contrast, the acceptors of both FRas2-F and
FRas2-M were localized to the cytosol and neurites (Figures 3B–
C). We observed that Ras activity rapidly peaked after BDNF
(100 ng/ml) application, remaining elevated for at least 15 min-
utes (Figure 3D). Remarkably, FRas2-M showed approximately
three fold higher signal compared to the other sensors (Figure 3B–
C). These data indicate that FRas2-M has higher sensitivity for
reporting Ras activation in neurons compared to FRas2-F and
FRas-F.

tion of RBD by comparing its fluorescence intensity in the cytosol
(mRFP-RBD-mRFP or its mutations) with that of purified mRFP
[28]. The concentration was estimated to be 1263 mM (N = 10)
for FRas-F, 3065 mM (N = 9) for FRas2-F and 2466 mM (N = 13)
for FRas2-M. Since these concentrations are much higher than the
dissociation constants of RBDs (Table 1), the simple biochemical
scheme does not explain the improvement in sensitivity. It is
possible that the effective dissociation constant in cells is much
lower than that in solution due to interactions with endogenous
proteins. Nonetheless, our results indicate that FRas2-M has much
higher sensitivity than other FRas variants.

Discussion

In this paper, we improved the cytosolic localization of the FRas
acceptor by introducing a point mutation to remove the NLS in
RBD (Figure 1). Furthermore, we have developed a variant with
slightly higher affinity (FRas2-M). The new FRas2-M sensor shows
much higher sensitivity in 293T cells and neurons than other FRas
variants (Figure 2, 3).

Previously, it has been reported that the inactivation of FRas-F
is much faster than FRas due to its lower affinity [13]. Because the
affinity of FRas2-M is higher than that of FRas-F, we expect that
FRas2-M decays more slowly and thus shows a greater degree of
spatial spreading compared to FRas-F (or FRas2-F) [13,25]. Thus,
as with Ca2+
indicators, one can use Ras sensors with two different
characteristics: a slow sensor with high affinity and high sensitivity
(FRas2-M); and fast sensor with low affinity and lower sensitivity
(FRas2-F). To quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras using
these sensors, one must measure the dependency of sensor kinetics
on RBD concentration and extrapolate to zero expression level
[25,28].

FRas-F has been shown to be useful for imaging Ras activity in
single dendritic spines undergoing synaptic plasticity [25]. The
improved sensitivity of these FRas2 sensors will provide more
