The neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and
moesin) family of plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton linkers. For ezrin, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphos-
phate (PIP2) binding to the amino-terminal FERM domain is required for its conformational activation,
proper subcellular localization, and function, but less is known about the role of phosphoinositide binding for
merlin. Current evidence indicates that association with the membrane is important for merlin to function as
a growth regulator; however, the mechanisms by which merlin localizes to the membrane are less clear. Here,
we report that merlin binds phosphoinositides, including PIP2, via a conserved binding motif in its FERM
domain. Abolition of FERM domain-mediated phosphoinositide binding of merlin displaces merlin from the
membrane and releases it into the cytosol without altering the folding of merlin. Importantly, a merlin protein
whose FERM domain cannot bind phosphoinositide is defective in growth suppression. Retargeting the mutant
merlin into the membrane using a dual-acylated amino-terminal decapeptide from Fyn is sufﬁcient to restore
the growth-suppressive properties to the mutant merlin. Thus, FERM domain-mediated phosphoinositide
binding and membrane association are critical for the growth-regulatory function of merlin.

Merlin, the neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppres-
sor protein, is a member of the band 4.1/ERM family of plasma
membrane-actin cytoskeleton linkers (6). Like other members
of this family, merlin has a globular amino-terminal FERM
(four point one, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain followed
by an ␣-helical coiled-coil domain and a carboxy-terminal do-
main (28, 58). The amino and carboxy termini of merlin and
ERM proteins can bind one another; thus, these proteins can
exist in two states, open and closed (6, 57). Interconversion
between the two states is regulated by phosphorylation near
the carboxy terminus. For ERM, the best-studied phosphory-
lated residue is a conserved threonine (ezrin T567, radixin
T564, and moesin T558) (42). Likewise, for merlin, the phos-
phorylated residue is S518 (56); only the dephosphorylated,
closed conformation is believed to be growth suppressive (44,
55, 57).

For ezrin, phosphorylation and the ability to undergo con-
formational changes are regulated by the binding of the FERM
domain to the membrane lipid, phosphoinositide-(4,5)-bisphos-
phate (PIP2) (3, 14). PIP2 facilitates the binding of ERM pro-
teins to membrane proteins (21, 24). Recent studies showed
that even after ezrin is phosphorylated, PIP2 binding is the
primary regulator of ERM membrane association (19).

The residues implicated in PIP2 binding are conserved
among the ERM proteins (17, 36, 58), and sequence homology

suggests that there are potential PIP2 binding motifs in the
merlin FERM domain. Exogenous addition of PIP2 enhances
the binding of a regulatory cofactor for Na⫹-H⫹ exchange
(NHE-RF) to merlin in vitro (16), suggesting that PIP2 binding
might play an important role in merlin function. Notably, three
of the six (K79, K269, and E270) merlin residues in the pre-
dicted PIP2 binding motif are sites of mutations in NF2 pa-
tients (58).

Recent evidence suggests that association with the plasma
membrane is important for merlin function (10, 11, 31–33, 41,
43). A signiﬁcant fraction of total cellular merlin associates
with cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich plasma membrane
domains in which numerous signaling events occur (8, 11, 61).
Precisely how merlin is linked to the membrane remains un-
known; however, PIP2 binding is a likely candidate mechanism
(39, 51). We therefore hypothesized that phosphoinositide
binding regulates the localization and growth-suppressive func-
tion of merlin. We report that merlin binds phosphorylated
phosphoinositides (PIP) and that PIP binding via a conserved
binding motif in the FERM domain is necessary for its proper
subcellular localization,
its association with membrane do-
mains, and intracellular dynamics. Mutating the FERM do-
main PIP binding sites does not affect the overall folding or the
phosphorylation status of merlin at S518. Importantly, FERM
domain PIP binding regulates the ability of merlin to inhibit
cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation, and colony formation.
Furthermore, retargeting the mutant merlin into membrane
domains using a dual-acylated amino-terminal decapeptide
from Fyn is sufﬁcient to restore the growth-suppressive func-
tion to the mutant merlin. Collectively, our data indicate that
FERM domain-mediated phosphoinositide binding and mem-
brane association are critical for the growth-regulatory func-
tion of merlin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and supplies. All reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless
otherwise noted. PIP strips, PIP arrays, and glutathione S-transferase–phospho-
lipase C-␦ (GST-PLC-␦) were from Echelon Biosciences, Inc. (Salt Lake City,
UT). N-Octyl-␤-D-glucopyranoside (NOG) was from Amresco Inc. (Solon, OH).
Cell culture. NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cellgro, Manassas, VA) contain-
ing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; ATCC) and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). SC4 cells, an immortalized, transformed Schwann
cell line derived from the Nf2⌬2/⌬2 (Nf2 with an in-frame deletion of exon 2)
mouse (15, 45), were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Serum Source International, Charlotte, NC) and 100 units/ml penicillin-
streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (In-
vitrogen).

DNA cloning. Human merlin isoform 1 (NM_000268) fused to a FLAG tag at
the amino terminus and the T7-tagged merlin FERM domain (amino acids [aa]
1 to 295) were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (61). QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce mutations. The
following primers (IDT, Coralville, IA) were used (changes to asparagine [N] are
italicized): for the K79N and K80N (2N merlin) mutations, 5⬘-GCC TGG CTC
AAA ATG GAC AAT AAT GTA CTG GAT CAT GAT G-3⬘ (forward); for the
K269N and E270N mutations, 5⬘-CGA AAC ATC TCG TAC AGT GAC AAT
AAT TTT ACT ATT AAA CCA CTG-3⬘ (forward); for the K278N and K279N
mutations, 5⬘-CCA CTG GAT AAC AAC ATT GAT GTC TTC AAG-3⬘ (for-
ward). For GST-merlin FERM fusion expression, wild-type (WT) and mutant 6N
merlin (merlin with the mutations K79N, K80N, K269N, E270N, K278N, and
K279N) FERM domains were cloned into pGEX4T2 (GE Health Care, Piscat-
away, NJ). Full-length WT merlin, full-length merlin 6N, or green ﬂuorescent
protein (GFP; control) was cloned into the pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-puromycin
lentivirus vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). To generate the
Fyn-tagged construct, nucleotides encoding the ﬁrst 10 amino acids of Fyn
(Fyn1-10; MGCVQCKDKE) were ﬁrst cloned into the pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-
puromycin vector. Full-length merlin 6N was then cloned into the Fyn tag-
containing vector to obtain the Fyn-merlin 6N construct. All constructs were
veriﬁed by DNA sequencing and Western blotting.

Full-length WT merlin, full-length merlin 6N, or GFP (control) cloned into the
pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-puromycin lentivirus vector was used to produce lenti-
viral particles at the Viral Vector Core, Translational Core Laboratories, Cin-
cinnati Children’s Medical Center. All biosafety precautions were followed dur-
ing virus handling as per the University of Cincinnati’s biosafety level 2 criteria.
Protein puriﬁcation. Rosetta 2(DE3) competent cells (Novagen, Madison,
WI) transformed with plasmids encoding fusion proteins were plated onto LB
plates containing either ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (30 mg/
liter) for GST fusion proteins or kanamycin (30 mg/liter) for His fusion proteins.
Colonies were grown in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics at 37°C
until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 1.8. Pelleted cells were
resuspended in fresh cooled (8°C) medium and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-
␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Amresco) at 20°C overnight. Following cen-
trifugation, induced cells were lysed, sonicated, and spun to recover the soluble
proteins in the supernatant. The supernatant was then incubated with glutathi-
one-Sepharose 4B (GE Health Care) for GST-tagged proteins or with Ni-Sep-
harose 6 Fast Flow (GE Health Care) for His-tagged proteins. Proteins bound to
beads were eluted, dialyzed, and stored as aliquots at ⫺80°C after determination
of protein concentration. His6-Cerulean-merlin-Venus-Strep tag proteins (full-
length WT and 6N) (Venus is a GFP mutant with a yellow-shifted emission
spectrum, and Cerulean is a GFP mutant with blue-shifted emission spectrum)
were puriﬁed using a dual-afﬁnity tag protocol as previously described (22).

Protein-lipid overlay assay. PIP strips and PIP arrays were blocked fo r 1 h in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 3%
fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). They were then incubated with 1
␮g/ml of the protein indicated on the ﬁgures in blocking solution for 1 h and
washed with PBST, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot anal-
ysis.

Intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence. GST-FERM WT or 6N protein intrinsic
ﬂuorescence measurements were carried out using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluo-
rolog-3 spectroﬂuorometer. Puriﬁed proteins were analyzed at a concentration of
1 ␮M in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5)–150 mM NaCl at room temperature. Samples were
excited at 295 nm with a 5-nm slit width, and ﬂuorescence emission spectra were
recorded from 300 nm to 500 nm at 1-nm intervals with a 5-nm slit width.

Chymotryptic digestion. Limited in-gel digestion of GST-FERM WT or 6N
puriﬁed proteins using different concentrations of chymotrypsin was carried out
as described previously (9).

FRET spectroﬂuorometry. His6-Cerulean, His6-Cerulean-6-Venus-Strep (with
Cerulean and Venus fused in frame and separated by a 6-residue linker), and
full-length wild-type and mutant 6N merlin proteins (His6-Cerulean-merlin-Ve-
nus-Strep) were puriﬁed and used for ﬂuorescent resonance energy transfer
(FRET) measurements as previously described (22).

CD. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of full-length wild-type and
mutant 6N merlin proteins (His6-Cerulean-merlin-Venus-Strep) were acquired
in an Aviv 215 circular dichroism spectrometer. The standard extinction coefﬁ-
cient at A280 is 59,375 M⫺1 cm⫺1. CD spectra were taken from 260 to 180 nm
after dialysis into buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaF, and 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol. Data were converted to units of mean
residue ellipticity using the following formula: [␪] ⫽ ␪/(10 䡠 C 䡠 l 䡠 nr), where ␪ is
the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the concentration in molar units, l is
the path length in cm, and nr is the number of residues. Secondary structure
deconvolution was carried out in the CDSSTR (27) module of Dichroweb (65),
and solutions from reference sets 3 and 6 were compared since these cover the
full wavelength range of usable experimental data.

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Sedimentation velocity experiments of
full-length wild-type and mutant 6N merlin proteins (His6-Cerulean-merlin-Ve-
nus-Strep) were carried out using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with
absorbance optics. All data were collected at 36,000 rpm and 20°C in a four-hole
rotor. Data were analyzed using a continuous c(s) distribution model in Sedﬁt
(54). Molecular weight estimates are based on a continuous c(M) analysis in
Sedﬁt. Samples were analyzed in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM ␤-mer-
captoethanol at 230 nm, a wavelength with minimal buffer absorbance.

GST–NHE-RF pulldown. Lysates from SC4 cells transfected with the con-
structs indicated on the ﬁgures were incubated with GST or GST–NHE-RF
bound to glutathione beads fo r 1 h at4°C. The beads were washed extensively,
resuspended in SDS buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted.
Detergent extraction. A total of 1.5 ⫻ 106 NIH 3T3 cells plated overnight (day
1) onto 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with indicated constructs (day
2). Medium was changed the following day (day 3) to regular medium. Conﬂuent
cells from each dish (day 4) were washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) and then lysed in cold 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) in TBS (pH 7.5) buffer
for 15 min on ice. A complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was added
during cell lysis along with the phosphatase inhibitors 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM
NaF, and 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ⫻
g for 20 min at 4°C to obtain a crude TX-100 pellet and TX-100 supernatant. The
TX-100 pellet was washed once with buffer, recentrifuged, and then resuspended
in lysis buffer with the addition of 100 mM NOG to partially solubilize the
TX-100-insoluble membrane domains. Equal volumes of TX-100 supernatant
and 100 mM NOG-soluble fractions were boiled for 5 min in 5⫻ sample buffer
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation. Whole-cell lysates from conﬂuent
cells were analyzed by OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation as previously
described (61).

Subcellular fractionation. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, conﬂuent NIH
3T3 cells were subjected to fractionation as previously described (31) with the
following modiﬁcation. Following recovery of the cytosolic fraction (C), the
membrane pellet (M) was directly extracted with modiﬁed radio immunopre-
cipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% TX-100,
0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and protease and phos-
phatase inhibitors) for 30 min at 4°C.

Immunoblot analysis. Proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
after SDS-PAGE were blocked overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 1% ﬁsh
gelatin. The following primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer con-
taining 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the membrane fo r 1 h atroom
temperature: anti-merlin A19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at
1:1,000, anti-merlin C18 (Santa Cruz) at 1:1,000, anti-pS518 merlin (Rockland,
Gilbertsville, PA) at 1:1,000, anti-GST (Sigma) at 1:5,000, anti-His (Applied
Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada) at 1:1,000, anticaveolin (BD Bio-
sciences, San Jose, CA) at 1:5,000, antiactin (Sigma) at 1:20,000, anti-transferrin
receptor (anti-TfR) (Invitrogen) at 1:2,000, anti-GFP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)
at 1:2,000, anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:1,000, anti-cyclin D1 Ab-3 (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Fremont CA) at 1:1,000, and anti-T7 (Novagen) at 1:5,000. We used
the IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland) and the Alexa Fluor
680 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) as secondary antibodies at a 1:10,000
dilution. Proteins were detected using a Li-Cor Odyssey Imaging System and
Odyssey, version 2.0, software (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE).

Live-cell imaging. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were split and plated onto
35-mm dishes ﬁtted with 12-mm glass coverslips (MatTek, Ashland, MA). The
following day, medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM containing 1
mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 10% serum. Live-cell imaging was per-

formed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal system with a Plan-Apochro-
mat 63⫻ (1.4 numerical aperture [63⫻/1.4]) oil objective. Cerulean images were
acquired using the 458-nm laser at 70% transmission along with a 475-nm
long-pass ﬁlter and 458/514-nm beam splitters. Venus images were acquired
using the 514-nm laser at 30% transmission along with a 530-nm long-pass ﬁlter
and the 458/514-nm beam splitters.

FRAP studies. At 24 h posttransfection NIH 3T3 cells grown on 25-mm
coverslips were transferred to live-cell imaging chambers (Atto) in a water-
jacketed stage incubator at 37°C. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal system. A
20-␮m2 area was photobleached for 5 s with 100% transmission of the 488-nm
argon laser running at 6.3 mW. Fluorescence intensities of the bleached area and
a distal unbleached area of equal size were measured every 5 s for 2 min at 20%
transmission. Values were normalized to prebleach intensities and compared to
the unbleached area to obtain relative ﬂuorescence intensities. Twenty cells per
condition were analyzed. The mean time for 50% recovery (T1/2) was calculated
from recovery curves by nonlinear regression analysis using the equation for
one-phase association: Y ⫽ Y0 ⫹ (Plateau ⫺Y0) 䡠 [1 ⫺ exp(⫺K 䡠 X)] (60) using
Prism 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Y0 is the Y value when X (time) is
zero; Plateau is the Y value at inﬁnity (⬁), K is the rate constant, tau is the time
constant (1/K), and T1/2 ⫽ ln (2)/K. Mobility is the difference between Y0 and
Plateau.

Merlin and actin colocalization. SC4 cells were transfected with either Ceru-
lean-merlin WT-Venus or Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus and plated onto cover-
slips. Cells were washed in PBS three times, followed by simultaneous ﬁxation
and permeabilization in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% TX-100 for 20
min at room temperature as previously described (33). Coverslips were blocked
for 30 min in the dark at room temperature in PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free
BSA followed by counterstaining with Alexa Fluor 633-phalloidin at a ﬁnal
concentration of 5U/ml (for actin) and with 4⬘,6⬘-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; for nuclei) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature in blocking buffer.
Coverslips were washed, mounted in Biomeda gel mount, and analyzed using a
Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning confocal system with a Plan-Apochromat 63⫻/1.4
oil objective. For cytochalasin D treatment, coverslips were pretreated with 2 ␮M
cytochalasin D for 30 min at 37°C prior to ﬁxation.

Endogenous merlin staining. NIH 3T3 cells or NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 (carrying two loxP
sites ﬂanking exon 2) cells plated onto coverslips were washed in PBS and ﬁxed
by one of the following methods. For TX-100 extraction prior to ﬁxation, cov-
erslips were incubated with ice-cold 1% TX-100 in PBS for 30 min on ice,
washed, and then ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde. For methanol or acetone
ﬁxation, coverslips were ﬁxed in 100% methanol or acetone, respectively, for 20
min at ⫺20°C. Following ﬁxation, coverslips were blocked fo r 1 h atroom
temperature in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% BSA. Coverslips were
incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-merlin A19 polyclonal primary antibody
(1:200 dilution). Coverslips were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) and DAPI (1:1,000 dilution) for
1 h at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were washed, mounted in
Biomeda gel mount, and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning confocal
system with a Plan-Apochromat 63⫻/1.4 oil objective.

Merlin-Venus ﬂuorescence in ﬁxed cells. To visualize merlin-Venus ﬂuores-
cence in ﬁxed cells, NIH 3T3 cells or SC4 cells transfected with merlin-Venus
were plated onto coverslips and ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde following cold
1% TX-100 extraction as described above. Coverslips were then counterstained
for nuclei using DAPI (1:1,000 dilution) for 20 min at room temperature in the
dark. Coverslips were washed, mounted, and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM710
laser scanning confocal system as described above.

MTT assay. A total of 2.5 ⫻ 105 SC4 cells that were plated overnight in four
wells of a six-well plate were either infected with recombinant lentivirus or mock
infected. After overnight infection, cells were trypsinized, and four 96-well plates
were prepared with 2.5 ⫻ 103 cells per 100-␮l per well, ﬁve sets per plate. A total
of 2.5 ⫻ 105 SC4 infected cells were simultaneously plated in parallel in six-well
plates to conﬁrm the expression of recombinant proteins. Methylthiazolyldiphe-
nyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed daily on one 96-well
plate as previously described (35). The readings were corrected with respect to
medium alone (blank control).

MEF, adenovirus infection, and BrdU incorporation. The immortalized
lines NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 and NF2⌬2/⌬2 were derived from
mouse ﬁbroblastic cell
NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 primary mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) as previously de-
scribed (5, 35). Cells were infected with the adenovirus indicated on the ﬁgures
at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 250. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western
immunoblotting. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, cells infected
with the adenovirus indicated on the ﬁgures on 22-mm2 coverslips were incu-
bated with 10 ␮M BrdU (BrdU kit 1; Roche) fo r 1 h at37°C and analyzed as per

the manufacturer’s instructions. BrdU immunoﬂuorescence was detected using
goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 at 1:200, and nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (Molecular probes). At least 500 cells per ﬁeld (10 ﬁelds per coverslip)
were counted in two independent experiments each.

Adhesion assay. NF2⌬2/⌬2 cells were infected with the adenovirus indicated on
the ﬁgures at an MOI of 250. Conﬂuent cells were either left in regular (10%
FBS) medium or serum starved in DMEM (0% FBS) for 24 h. For suspension
analysis, one set of serum-starved cells was washed twice with Hanks’ balanced
salt solution (HBSS), trypsinized, washed twice in DMEM containing 0.1% soya
bean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% essentially fatty acid-free BSA, and ﬁnally re-
suspended in DMEM for 30 min at 37°C as previously described (55).

Colony formation assay. SC4 cells were transfected with pCDH constructs
containing a puromycin resistance gene. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, 3 ⫻
104 cells of each type were plated in triplicate in 10-cm dishes and selected with
3 ␮g/ml puromycin for a week. Medium was changed every 2 to 3 days. Untrans-
fected cells were completely dead within 3 to 4 days (data not shown). Colonies
were stained with crystal violet.

RESULTS

Merlin FERM domain binds phosphoinositides. Compari-
son with the ezrin sequence reveals that potential PIP2 binding
motifs [KKXn(K/R)K] are present in the FERM domain of
human merlin (Fig. 1A) at 79-KKVLDHDVSK-88 and at 269-
KEFTIKPLDKK-279. To test the hypothesis that these motifs
are involved in PIP2 binding, we converted the homologous
charged residues K79, K80, K269, E270, K278, and K279 to
neutral asparagines (merlin 6N). Wild-type merlin and merlin
6N FERM domains fused to GST were tested for lipid binding.
The FERM domain of wild-type merlin binds phosphorylated
phosphoinositides including PIP2 (Fig. 1Be), whereas the mer-
lin 6N FERM domain shows drastically reduced binding (Fig.
1Bf). These results were conﬁrmed using PIP arrays (Fig. 1C).
Thus, the merlin FERM domain binds phosphorylated phos-
phoinositides in vitro, and the charged amino acids K79, K80,
K269, E270, K278, and K279 are necessary for this interaction.
Mutant merlin is folded properly. To exclude the possibility
that introduction of the six point mutations in the FERM
domain of merlin drastically alters the folding of FERM do-
main or full-length merlin, we performed the following exper-
iments. The overall intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence proﬁles
of GST-FERM WT and GST-FERM 6N were recorded. They
are very similar without signiﬁcant changes in either the max-
imum intensity of ﬂuorescence or the wavelength of maximum
emission (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the digestion patterns of GST-
FERM domain proteins (WT and 6N) following limited chy-
motryptic proteolysis are similar (Fig. 2B). To investigate for
changes in full-length merlin conformation upon introduction
of the 6N mutations, we performed FRET spectroﬂuorometry
as previously described (22). The emission spectra of Cerulean-
merlin WT-Venus and Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus proteins
are similar, indicating that both the wild-type and 6N mutant
merlin proteins adopt similar conformations. Treatment with
0.1% SDS, which denatures merlin, served as an internal neg-
ative control (Fig. 2C). Full-length Cerulean-merlin-Venus
wild-type and 6N merlin secondary structure content was com-
pared by far-UV CD spectroscopy to verify that the mutant
had folded with a backbone conformation similar to that of
wild-type merlin (Fig. 2D). The spectra are similar, indicating
an overall similar fold, but the minor deviations between 213
and 227 nm indicate slight differences in ␣-helical content. This
is conﬁrmed by the CDSSTR deconvolution, which shows an
average difference of about 6% helix and sheet content be-

was calculated to be 124 ⫾ 31 kDa versus 125 ⫾ 30 kDa for
Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus, which is in close agreement with
its calculated molecular mass of 130 kDa. Thus, both the sed-
imentation coefﬁcient and frictional ratio values are consistent
with similar sizes and shapes of wild-type and 6N mutant mer-
lin proteins, indicating that the mutations do not cause any
large-scale structural perturbations. Furthermore, GST–
NHE-RF pulldown reveals that both full-length merlin WT-
GFP and full-length merlin 6N-GFP bind to GST–NHE-RF, a
known merlin binding partner (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these
studies indicate that the introduction of six amino acid point
mutations in the PIP binding motif within the merlin FERM
domain does not drastically alter the structure of either the
FERM domain or that of full-length merlin.

PIP binding of the merlin FERM domain is essential for its
association with cholesterol-dependent membrane domains.
We have previously shown that exogenously expressed merlin-
GFP resides in the cholesterol-dependent 20% and 25% frac-
tions following density gradient centrifugation (61). We veri-
ﬁed that endogenous merlin from conﬂuent NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MEF
cells also equilibrates to the same buoyant fractions (Fig. 3A).
Importantly, pretreatment with 10 mM methyl-␤-cyclodextrin
(M␤CD; a cholesterol-extracting reagent) for 30 min results in
the disappearance of merlin from the 20% fraction and a
decrease in the amount of merlin in the 25% fraction, indicat-
ing that the 20% and 25% fractions represent cholesterol-
dependent domain fractions. M␤CD treatment results in a
similar shift of caveolin, a protein known to reside in choles-
terol-dependent membrane domains, to higher-density frac-
tions without affecting the fractionation of the negative-control
marker, transferrin receptor (TfR).

To determine if PIP2 binding plays a role in the association
of merlin with membrane domains, we performed two types of
assays: solubility in cold nonionic detergent and density gradi-
ent centrifugation. In the ﬁrst, lysates from conﬂuent NIH 3T3
cells (a condition that activates the growth-suppressive func-
tion of merlin) expressing empty vector or T7-tagged merlin
WT FERM or merlin 6N FERM were sequentially extracted
with cold 1% TX-100 and 100 mM NOG. As reviewed by
Shogomori and Brown (59), insolubility of a protein in TX-100
and its solubility in NOG are good indicators that the protein
resides in cholesterol-dependent membrane domains. The
wild-type merlin FERM domain is present in both the TX-100-
soluble and the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-soluble fractions (Fig.
3B). In contrast, the merlin 6N FERM domain, which does not
bind PIP, resides almost exclusively in the TX-100-soluble frac-
tion and is essentially absent in the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-
soluble fraction.

A more deﬁnitive indication for cholesterol-dependent
membrane domain residence is the buoyancy of the candidate
in a density gradient (18, 20, 64). Similar to full-length endog-
enous merlin (Fig. 3A), the T7-tagged wild-type merlin FERM
domain equilibrates to the 20% and 25% fractions of the
density gradient (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the T7-tagged merlin
6N FERM domain, which does not bind PIP, is mainly present
in the higher-density fractions (Fig. 3C).

This conclusion was conﬁrmed by a more detailed analysis in
which PIP binding mutations were studied in the context of
full-length merlin. In this analysis, two (K79 and K80; merlin
2N), four (K79, K80, K269, and E270; merlin 4N), or all six

FIG. 1. Merlin FERM domain binds phosphoinositides. (A) Se-
quence alignment of the parts of the FERM domains of ezrin, radixin,
moesin, and merlin that contain the PIP2 binding motif. The residues
involved in PIP2 binding in ezrin (3) are shown in bold type. (B) Pro-
tein-lipid overlay assay using PIP strips containing 100 picomoles per
spot of various phosphoinositides and lipids (n ⱖ 3). Compared to
GST-merlin FERM WT, the GST-merlin FERM 6N shows greatly
reduced binding to phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Panels b and d
are positive controls for PIP binding. GST-tropomodulin 3 (GST-
Tmod3), an actin binding protein that does not bind PIP, is a negative
control. GST alone does not bind PIP (data not shown). LPA, lyso-

crease in sedimentation coefﬁcient (s*) observed for the mu-

protein (5.5 ⫾ 0.7). If the 6N mutations led to a large-scale
unfolding of the mutant, we would expect an increased fric-
tional ratio (f/f0) relative to the wild type, but this is not the
case as the frictional ratio is 1.6 for both the wild type and 6N
mutant. The molecular mass of Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus

FIG. 2. Mutant merlin 6N is properly folded. (A) Tryptophan ﬂuorescence. GST-FERM WT and 6N proteins have similar tryptophan
ﬂuorescence proﬁles following excitation at 295 nm (n ⫽ 3). The y axis shows the relative ﬂuorescence units at the different wavelengths (x axis).
(B) Chymotryptic digest. Coomassie-stained gel shows that both GST-FERM WT and GST-FERM 6N proteins yield similar-size peptide
fragments with various concentrations of chymotrypsin. The asterisk denotes the position of uncleaved GST-FERM proteins. (C) FRET
spectroﬂuorometry. Mean emission spectra of full-length puriﬁed proteins following excitation at 435 nm and measured in triplicate at room
temperature are plotted, normalized to the maximum value in each given scan such that all plotted values are ⱕ1. FRET (the ﬂuorescence emission
of acceptor Venus between 515 nm and 550 nm when excited at the donor Cerulean excitation wavelength of 435 nm) is not signiﬁcantly different
between Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus (C-Mer WT-V) and Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus (C-Mer 6N-V). Addition of 0.1% SDS (internal negative
control) abolishes the FRET for both WT and 6N proteins, indicating that FRET requires properly folded merlin. FRET of C6V (positive control)
is not affected by 0.1% SDS as previously shown (22). Cerulean alone (negative control) did not show FRET (data not shown), as described
previously (22). (D) Circular dichroism. Full-length merlin WT and mutant merlin 6N (C-Mer-V) secondary structure contents were compared by
far-UV CD spectroscopy. The spectra are similar, indicating overall similar folds. The y axis shows the mean residue ellipticity (see Materials and
Methods). (E) Analytical ultracentrifugation. AUC studies of puriﬁed full-length (WT and 6N) C-Mer-V show that the sedimentation coefﬁcient
values (5.5 ⫾ 0.7 versus 5.4 ⫾ 0.8) and apparent molecular masses (125 ⫾ 30 kDa versus 124 ⫾ 31 kDa) are not signiﬁcantly different between
the WT and 6N proteins. Values in parenthesis are for WT and 6N, respectively. The frictional ratios (f/f0) are also identical (1.6) for both proteins.
(F) GST—NHE-RF pulldown. Merlin WT and mutant merlin 6N bind NHE-RF. Lysates from SC4 cells transfected with full-length merlin
WT-GFP, merlin 6N-GFP, or GFP alone were subjected to GST or GST–NHE-RF pulldown as described in Materials and Methods.

(K79, K80, K269, E270, K278, and K279; merlin 6N) putative
PIP binding residues were altered in full-length merlin. Mu-
tating the FERM domain PIP binding sites similarly decreases
the amount of merlin in the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-soluble
fraction (data not shown). As shown previously (61), full-
length FLAG-tagged WT merlin is present in the low-density
20% and 25% fractions (Fig. 3D) in a cholesterol-dependent
manner (similar to Fig. 3A) (data not shown). In contrast,

full-length merlin 2N showed decreased ﬂotation to the 20%
fraction and a shift toward the higher-density fractions. Full-
length merlin 4N showed the same tendency but to a greater
extent, whereas full-length merlin 6N was almost completely
excluded from the 20% and 25% fractions and was present
predominantly in the higher-density fractions. Approximately
50% of total full-length WT merlin associates with the choles-
terol-dependent 20% and 25% fractions, which signiﬁcantly

FIG. 3. FERM domain PIP binding regulates the association of merlin with cholesterol-dependent membrane domains. (A) Endogenous
merlin resides in cholesterol-dependent buoyant fractions. Conﬂuent NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MEF cells were pretreated with either DMEM or 10 mM M␤CD
(methyl-␤-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-extracting reagent) in DMEM for 30 min at 37°C prior to cell lysis. Western immunoblotting following density
gradient centrifugation of whole-cell lysates shows that endogenous merlin is present in the buoyant fractions (20% and 25%). Transferrin receptor
(TfR) and caveolin are shown as controls. M␤CD treatment results in the disappearance of merlin from the 20% fraction and a decrease in the
amount of merlin in the 25% fraction, indicating that the 20% and 25% fractions are cholesterol dependent. M␤CD treatment similarly results
in a shift of caveolin to the higher-density fractions without affecting the fractionation of the negative-control marker, transferrin receptor (TfR).
(B) T7-tagged merlin FERM WT is present in both the TX-100 soluble (T) and the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-soluble (N) fraction, whereas the level
of T7-tagged merlin FERM 6N mutant in the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-soluble fraction is drastically reduced in transfected NIH 3T3 cells.
Transferrin receptor is a control for the TX-100-soluble fraction, and caveolin, a known component of membrane domains, is present in both the
TX-100-soluble and the TX-100-insoluble–NOG-soluble fractions. Results in panels A and B are representative of three independent experiments.
EV, empty vector. (C) OptiPrep fractionation of whole-cell lysates from conﬂuent and transfected NIH 3T3 cells shows that T7-tagged merlin
FERM WT is present in the 20% and 25% fractions of the density gradient, whereas the T7-tagged merlin FERM 6N is mainly present in the
higher-density fractions. (D) OptiPrep fractionation of lysates from conﬂuent and transfected NIH 3T3 cells (n ⱖ 3) shows that FLAG-tagged
full-length WT merlin ﬂoats to the buoyant fractions (20% and 25%) of the density gradient. Transferrin receptor and caveolin are shown as
controls. FLAG-tagged full-length merlin 2N and 4N show decreased ﬂotation to the 20% fraction. FLAG-tagged full-length merlin 6N is excluded
from the 20% and 25% fractions altogether and is mainly present in the higher-density fractions. We probed for the transferrin receptor and
caveolin in each case (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained in SC4 cells (Fig. 9 and data not shown). (E) Quantiﬁcation of density
gradient centrifugation for FLAG-tagged full-length merlin using Odyssey, version 2.0, software shows decreasing residence in the cholesterol-
dependent buoyant fractions (20% and 25%) and a corresponding increase in the higher-density fractions (30%, 35%, and 40%) as the PIP2
binding motif in the FERM domain is progressively modiﬁed. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance. Error bars

decreases with progressive ablation of the PIP binding sites
(Fig. 3E). Thus, for both the merlin FERM domain alone and
the full-length merlin molecule, PIP binding to the FERM
domain regulates its detergent resistance and its association
with cholesterol-dependent membrane domains.

FERM domain PIP binding regulates subcellular localiza-
tion of merlin. The results presented above suggest that FERM
domain PIP binding may affect the subcellular localization of
merlin. To assess this possibility, we constructed expression
vectors by fusing two variants of GFP in frame to either the
amino or carboxy terminus of merlin as previously described

(22). Cerulean is a monomeric, blue-shifted GFP (53), whereas
Venus is yellow shifted (46). The following vectors were cre-
ated: Cerulean-merlin WT, merlin WT-Venus, Cerulean-mer-
lin WT-Venus, and their PIP binding-deﬁcient counterparts.
Confocal imaging of live, transfected NIH 3T3 cells showed
that WT merlin is predominantly localized to regions of the
plasma membrane and cell periphery irrespective of the loca-
tion of the modiﬁed GFP tag (Fig. 4A). In addition, WT merlin
was also present at regions of the cell-cell boundary (Fig. 4Ae).
Cerulean-merlin 2N-Venus had a subcellular localization sim-
ilar to that of WT merlin but was also present at a low but

FIG. 4. FERM domain PIP binding regulates subcellular localization of merlin. (A) By confocal live microscopy, NIH 3T3 cells expressing
Cerulean alone (a) or Venus alone (b) showed uniform and diffuse ﬂuorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. WT merlin is predom-
inantly localized to regions of the plasma membrane irrespective of whether the modiﬁed GFP tag is present at the amino terminus (Cerulean-
merlin WT), the carboxy terminus (Merlin WT-Venus), or at both termini (Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus). Additionally, WT merlin is also present
at regions of the cell-cell boundary (e). Merlin 2N (Cerulean-merlin 2N-Venus) and merlin 4N (Cerulean-merlin 4N-Venus) are localized to the
plasma membrane and regions of the cell-cell boundary but are also detectable in the cytoplasm. In contrast, merlin 6N (Cerulean-merlin
6N-Venus) shows predominantly cytoplasmic localization and is not enriched at regions of the cell-cell boundary. Corresponding differential
interference contrast images are shown in the right panels. Scale bar, 10 ␮m. (B and C) Conﬂuent NIH 3T3 cells expressing the indicated merlin
constructs were fractionated into cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting. Full-length FLAG-tagged WT
merlin is mainly present in the membrane fractions. Mutating the FERM domain PIP binding sites increases the amount of mutant merlin in the
cytosolic fractions. The efﬁciency of fractionation was veriﬁed using caveolin as a membrane marker, and actin was used as a loading control for
corresponding lanes (B). The Cerulean-merlin-Venus fusion proteins (WT and 6N) fractionate similarly to their respective non-GFP-tagged merlin
proteins (C).

detectable level in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4Af). Similarly, merlin
4N localized to the plasma membrane and regions of the cell-
cell boundary but also the cytoplasm (Fig. 4Ag). In contrast,
merlin 6N, which does not bind PIP at its FERM domain,
showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization and is not en-
riched at regions of the cell periphery or cell-cell boundary
(Fig. 4Ah). Similar live-cell imaging results were obtained in
transfected SC4 cells (data not shown).

The results of subcellular localization were veriﬁed by bio-
chemical fractionation. Whereas WT merlin is predominantly
present in the membrane fraction, mutating the FERM do-
main PIP binding sites signiﬁcantly increases the amount of

mutant merlin in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4B). To rule out
the possibility that the addition of GFP tags to merlin alters its
localization, we compared the fractionation of merlin with or
without the GFP tags. Both of the Cerulean-merlin-Venus
fusion proteins, WT and 6N, fractionated similarly to the re-
spective non-GFP tagged merlin proteins, with the PIP binding
mutants localizing more to the cytosolic fractions than their
WT counterparts (Fig. 4C).

Confocal imaging of endogenous merlin staining after ex-
traction with ice-cold 1% TX-100 followed by 4% paraformal-
dehyde ﬁxation in both NIH 3T3 cells and in NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2

FIG. 5. Subcellular localization of endogenous or transfected merlin in ﬁxed cells. (A) Confocal images of NIH 3T3 cells and NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MEF
cells that were ﬁxed either with 4% paraformaldehyde after ice-cold 1% TX-100 extraction (TX-100, 4% PFA), methanol, or acetone reveal that
endogenous merlin shows a distinct punctate membrane localization. Merlin is shown in red, and nuclei are in blue (DAPI). (B) Confocal images
of NIH 3T3 cells or SC4 cells transfected with merlin WT-Venus and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde after ice-cold 1% TX-100 extraction
(TX-100, 4% PFA) similarly reveal a distinct punctate membrane ﬂuorescence. Merlin-Venus ﬂuorescence is shown in green, and nuclei are in blue
(DAPI). (C) Confocal images of SC4 cells transfected with Cerulean-merlin-Venus following ﬁxation and permeabilization in 4% paraformalde-
hyde containing 0.2% TX-100 and counterstaining with phalloidin (for actin) are shown. The top row shows that merlin WT (green) shows
extensive colocalization (yellow) with actin (red). Pretreatment with cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin cytoskeleton, results in the loss of this
colocalization and accumulation of merlin as intracellular aggregates (middle row). The bottom row shows that merlin 6N was largely cytoplasmic
(green) where it did not colocalize with actin (red). However, some of the merlin 6N ﬂuorescence that does remain at the membrane did colocalize
(yellow) with actin (arrows).

as described previously (10, 61). Similar endogenous merlin
staining was observed following methanol or acetone ﬁxation
in NIH 3T3 cells and in NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 cells (Fig. 5A). To directly
compare this localization of endogenous merlin with that of
ﬂuorescence from the modiﬁed GFP fused to merlin (Fig. 4
shows live-cell imaging), we analyzed the localization of merlin
WT-Venus ﬂuorescence in NIH 3T3 cells and SC4 cells after
extraction with ice-cold 1% TX-100 followed by 4% parafor-
maldehyde ﬁxation. Fixation under this condition revealed a
distinct punctate membrane merlin WT-Venus ﬂuorescence in
both NIH 3T3 cells and in SC4 cells (Fig. 5B), similar to that
of endogenous merlin in NIH 3T3 cells and in NF2ﬂox2/ﬂox2
cells. Thus, both endogenous and overexpressed epitope-

tagged merlin proteins appear in the same subcellular com-
partment.

Next, we wished to determine whether FERM domain-me-
diated PIP binding and subsequent membrane association are
required for merlin colocalization with the actin cortical cyto-
skeleton. In SC4 cells transfected with Cerulean-merlin-Venus
(WT and 6N), merlin WT ﬂuorescence localized to the cortical
membrane and colocalized with phalloidin (actin) staining.
This colocalization was dependent on intact actin cytoskeleton/
cellular architecture as treatment with cytochalasin D resulted
in loss of merlin WT and actin colocalization and accumulation
of merlin WT as large aggregates, as previously described (10,
33). In contrast, merlin 6N ﬂuorescence was largely cytoplas-

mic (Fig. 5C). However, some of the merlin 6N ﬂuorescence
that does remain at the membrane (Fig. 4C) colocalized with
actin (see discussion below).

FERM domain PIP binding regulates merlin dynamics. To
determine if PIP binding regulates merlin localization dynam-
ically, we assessed the mobility of the expressed merlin in live
transfected NIH 3T3 cells by ﬂuorescence recovery after pho-
tobleaching (FRAP). Venus was used as a freely diffusible
protein control, and GFP fused in frame with histone 2B
(H2B-GFP) was used as a control for an essentially immobile
protein (2, 50).

The T1/2 of recovery for wild-type Cerulean-merlin WT-
Venus suggests that merlin is not freely diffusible but likely
tethered to structural elements in the cell. In stark contrast, the
FRAP behavior of the PIP binding-deﬁcient merlin (merlin
6N) was essentially identical to that of the freely diffusible
Venus (Fig. 6). Finally, the recovery of ﬂuorescence in cells
transfected with Cerulean-6-Venus (Cerulean and Venus
fused in frame and separated by a 6-residue linker) was iden-
tical to that of cells transfected with Venus alone, indicating
that the presence of two modiﬁed GFPs does not alter FRAP
under these experimental conditions (data not shown).

FERM domain PIP binding is not required to regulate mer-
lin phosphorylation at S518. For ezrin, phosphorylation is reg-
ulated by FERM domain PIP2 binding (3, 14). As merlin is
regulated by phosphorylation at S518 (56), we analyzed cell
lysates from NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF cells following reexpression of
wild-type or mutant merlin proteins for their steady-state S518
phosphorylation status. Interestingly, we found that FERM
domain PIP binding is not required for steady-state S518 phos-
phorylation in NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF cells (Fig. 7A) and in NIH 3T3
cells and SC4 cells (data not shown).

We further examined if the 6N mutation affected the phos-
phorylation status of merlin in response to loss of adhesion.
We found that both merlin WT and 6N can be dephosphoryl-
ated at S518 following simultaneous serum starvation and sus-
pension (Fig. 7B), as previously described (55). In addition,
both merlin WT and 6N can be further phosphorylated at S518
by cotransfection with active Rac Q61L (Fig. 7C), as previously
described (29, 56). These results suggest that FERM domain
PIP binding is not required to signiﬁcantly regulate merlin
phosphorylation at S518.

FERM domain PIP binding is essential for the growth-
suppressive function of merlin. Reexpression of merlin in SC4
cells inhibits cell growth (45). To determine if FERM domain
PIP binding regulates the growth-suppressive function of mer-
lin, SC4 cells were either infected with recombinant lentivirus
expressing full-length WT merlin or full-length merlin 6N or
GFP or mock infected. SC4 cells infected with full-length WT
merlin had a signiﬁcantly reduced growth rate on days 3 and 4
compared to that of the controls (Fig. 8A). In contrast, SC4
cells infected with full-length merlin 6N grew at the same rate
as mock-infected and control GFP-infected cells.

Several studies have shown that merlin inhibits cell prolif-
eration and cell cycle progression, at least in part by repressing
cyclin D1 expression (5, 10, 26, 31, 48, 67). Reexpression of WT
merlin in merlin-null NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF and in merlin-null SC4
cells (data not shown) is sufﬁcient to repress cyclin D1 expres-
sion. In contrast, the mutant merlin 6N does not repress cyclin
D1 expression (Fig. 8B). Consistent with this result, reexpres-

sion of WT merlin, but not mutant merlin 6N or the GFP
control, in merlin-null NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF inhibits cell proliferation
as assessed by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 8C). Additionally,
reexpression of WT merlin, but not of mutant merlin 6N, was
sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly inhibit colony formation compared to
vector alone in SC4 cells following puromycin selection (Fig.
8D). Taken together, these results indicate that in the absence
of FERM domain PIP binding, the ability of merlin to suppress
cell growth is signiﬁcantly compromised. Finally, it has been
reported recently that merlin inhibits phospho-S6, phospho-S6
kinase (S6K), and mTOR signaling (26, 40). In our hands,
mutant merlin 6N inhibits phospho-S6 and phospho-S6K as
efﬁciently as WT merlin, indicating that FERM domain phos-
phoinositide binding is not a prerequisite for inhibition of
mTOR signaling by merlin (data not shown).

Retargeting the FERM domain PIP binding-deﬁcient mu-
tant merlin into the membrane is sufﬁcient to restore the
growth-suppressive function to the mutant merlin. To test if
retargeting of the mutant merlin 6N to the membrane is suf-
ﬁcient to rescue its growth-suppressive defect, we fused the
ﬁrst 10 amino acids from the Src family kinase Fyn (Fyn1–10) to
its amino terminus. Fyn1–10 is myristoylated at glycine-2 and
palmitoylated at cysteine-3. This dual acylation confers a high
afﬁnity for signaling-rich membrane domains that have high
cholesterol and glycosphingolipid contents (38, 52, 68). In a
density gradient, Fyn1–10 is sufﬁcient to target GFP, as well as
retarget the mutant merlin 6N, into the buoyant 20% and 25%
fractions following ultracentrifugation (Fig. 9A), conﬁrming its
ability to restore proper localization to the mutant merlin 6N.
Importantly, Fyn1–10-merlin 6N is sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly in-
hibit colony formation of SC4 cells to the level of wild-type
merlin (Fig. 9B). Thus, retargeting of the FERM domain PIP
binding-deﬁcient merlin into the membrane is sufﬁcient to
restore growth-suppressive properties to the mutant merlin.

DISCUSSION

Recent studies have provided strong evidence that merlin
must be at or near the plasma membrane for it to function as
a growth regulator (10, 11, 31–33, 41, 43). While details of how
merlin functions at the membrane appear to differ between cell
types and species, merlin regulates the availability of growth
factor receptors either by affecting the rate at which they are
internalized or by sequestering them in inert compartments
where they cannot signal (43). In addition, merlin regulates the
delivery to and the accumulation of growth factor receptors at
the plasma membrane (32).

How merlin associates with the membrane, however, is less
clear. Since it is not an integral membrane protein, its associ-
ation with the membrane must be mediated by an intermediary
protein or a resident phospholipid. In this paper, we report
that phosphoinositide binding tethers merlin to the plasma
membrane. Importantly,
this binding is necessary for its
growth-suppressive function.

The residues implicated in FERM domain-mediated PIP2
binding are conserved among the ERM proteins and are lo-
cated at the surface of the molecule, a positively charged ﬂat
surface formed by subdomains A and C and containing a basic
cleft (17, 36). Likewise, the corresponding surface of the mer-
lin FERM domain is positively charged, suggesting that a sim-

FIG. 6. FERM domain PIP binding regulates merlin dynamics. (A) Representative confocal images showing ﬂuorescence recovery after
photobleaching in NIH 3T3 cells (n ⫽ 20) transfected with H2B-GFP (a), Venus (b), Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus (c), and Cerulean-merlin
6N-Venus (d). Cells transfected with Cerulean-merlin 2N-Venus and Cerulean-merlin 4N-Venus had similar recovery as those transfected with
Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus (data not shown). A 20-␮m2 area was photobleached (white box) for 5 s, and the recovery of ﬂuorescence in this area
was measured every 5 s for 2 min along with the ﬂuorescence in a control nonbleached 20-␮m2 area in the cell (red box). Scale bar, 10 ␮m.
(B) Quantiﬁcation of FRAP analysis. The normalized relative ﬂuorescence intensities (bleached versus unbleached) were plotted as a percentage
on the y axis with time in seconds on the x axis. Cells transfected with Venus alone (green; positive control) had a quick recovery consistent with
it being freely diffusible. Cells transfected with H2B-GFP, an essentially immobile protein, failed to recover ﬂuorescence efﬁciently (black; negative
control). The ﬂuorescence recovery of cells transfected with Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus (blue) was signiﬁcantly slower ($$$, P ⬍ 0.001) than that
of cells transfected with Venus alone. FRAP in cells transfected with Cerulean-merlin 2N-Venus (purple) or Cerulean-merlin 4N-Venus (yellow)
(###, P ⬍ 0.001; #, P ⬍ 0.05) or with Cerulean-merlin 6N-Venus (red; ***, P ⬍ 0.001; **, P ⬍ 0.01; *, P ⬍ 0.05) was signiﬁcantly faster than
with Cerulean-merlin WT-Venus and was essentially identical to that of freely diffusible Venus. Two-way analysis of variance was used for statistical
analysis. Error bars indicate the means ⫾95% conﬁdence intervals. (C) Table showing the mean percentages of the mobile fraction, the T1/2 of
recovery, and tau calculated using the equation described in Materials and Methods. Values in parentheses denote 95% conﬁdence intervals. Note
that the merlin mutants have a signiﬁcantly shorter T1/2 and tau values than WT merlin.

ilar interaction of these residues with the negatively charged
phospholipids, such as PIP2 molecules in the bilayer, is feasible
(58). Although our in vitro studies show that merlin binds many
PIPs, it is likely that in quiescent cells PIP2 is the physiological

PIP that binds merlin and targets it to the membrane. PIP2 and
phosphatidyl inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] are the
major species at the plasma membrane (13), but PIP2, at
⬃10% of total PIP, is far more abundant than PI(3,4,5)P3 since

merlin phosphorylation at S518. (A) FERM domain PIP binding is not
required for steady-state S518 phosphorylation. NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF cells
were infected with the indicated adenovirus, and lysates were run for
Western immunoblotting. (B) WT and 6N merlin can be dephosphor-
ylated at S518 following simultaneous serum starvation and suspen-
sion. NF2⌬2/⌬2 MEF cells infected with the indicated adenovirus were
either left in 10% FBS regular medium (Reg) or serum starved in
DMEM (SS) or serum starved and suspended (SS ⫹ Susp) as de-
scribed in Materials and Methods, and lysates were run for Western
immunoblotting. (C) Active Rac Q61L further enhances the phosphor-
ylation at S518 for both WT and 6N merlin. Immunoblot analysis of
lysates from SC4 cells that were transfected as follows: lanes, 1, vector

merlin-WT-Venus (C-mer WT-V)/empty vector cotransfection; lanes

less than 0.25% of all phosphoinositides is phosphorylated at
the 3-position (49). PIP2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 are necessary to tar-
get proteins with polybasic clusters to the plasma membrane
(23). In many cell types, approximately half of cellular PIP2 is
concentrated in cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich mem-
brane domains (39, 51). This and the ﬂotation of merlin to the
lightest fractions of a density gradient support the notion that
merlin resides in such an environment.

Mutation of the PIP2 binding sites in the ezrin FERM do-
main speciﬁcally abolished interaction with PIP2 without alter-
ing ezrin folding (3). The high degree of sequence and struc-
tural similarity between the ezrin and merlin FERM domains
justiﬁes similar mutagenesis studies on merlin. Intrinsic tryp-
tophan ﬂuorescence and limited chymotryptic digestion of the
FERM domain indicate that mutating the PIP binding site
does not cause large-scale changes in the folding of the FERM
domain. Circular dichroism and AUC measurements indicate
that ablation of the PIP binding site does not cause large-scale
changes in the secondary structure content or the size and
shape of merlin. Additionally, merlin WT and 6N have similar
FRET properties, providing further evidence against a large-
scale conformational change induced by the 6N mutations.
Functionally, the PIP2 binding-deﬁcient merlin efﬁciently binds
NHE-RF, a known merlin-interacting partner, and can be

phosphorylated at S518, indicating that it is accessible to the
cognate kinases for this functionally important residue. Taken
together, these results provide strong evidence that the FERM
domain PIP2 binding-deﬁcient merlin folds properly.

In agreement with previous studies (31, 62), wild-type merlin
is predominantly localized to regions of the plasma membrane
and cell-cell boundary and colocalizes with actin. Merlin de-
fective in FERM domain PIP binding, however, is mainly cy-
toplasmic and absent from the cell-cell boundary. However, we
did see some cortical actin colocalization with the merlin 6N
that still remains at the membrane, making it difﬁcult for us to
make a conclusive interpretation, at the level of confocal mi-
croscopy, of the need of FERM domain PIP binding in merlin
colocalization with the actin cortical cytoskeleton. The partial
residence of the 6N merlin mutant at the membrane may be
due to the presence of the intact N-terminal 18 amino acids, an
obligatory sequence for membrane attachment and for pro-
tein-protein interaction (10). FERM domain PIP binding plays
a crucial role in membrane targeting of other FERM domain-
containing proteins as well, including ezrin (3, 14) and PTPL1,
a protein tyrosine phosphatase (4). Abolishing PIP binding
greatly enhances the diffusibility of merlin, consistent with the
notion that loss of PIP binding leads to detachment from the

ila, the Ste20 kinase, Slik, phosphorylates merlin at the equiv-
alent residue, T616, thereby regulating its subcellular localiza-
tion (25). Okada et al. (47) reported that Akt phosphorylation
of merlin enhances its binding to phosphoinositides. Although
FERM domain PIP binding is apparently not required for
phosphorylation at S518, it is nevertheless important for the
activity of merlin as a growth suppressor, as suggested by our
functional data. Failure to bind PIP causes merlin to be dis-
placed from the plasma membrane into the cytosol, and con-
currently merlin loses its ability to suppress cell growth. Fur-
thermore, restoration of membrane localization by attachment
of a Fyn-based decapeptide reverses this loss of function. In
view of our results, one is tempted to speculate that retargeting
certain NF2 mutant proteins into membrane might restore
merlin function. This cohort of mutations in NF2 patients is
characterized by enhanced detergent solubility and loss of
membrane association, including the point mutations K79E,
⌬118 (62), and L360P (12). We are currently testing this hy-
pothesis.

Recently, Li et al. (37) provided evidence that merlin sup-
presses cell growth by translocating into the nucleus, binding to
the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, and suppressing its ability
to ubiquitylate target proteins. Given that this mode of merlin
action is vastly different from mechanisms proposed for merlin
at or near the plasma membrane (43), it is reasonable to
entertain the notion that merlin is deployed in divergent,
and perhaps redundant, ways to ensure that its function is
fulﬁlled. Consistent with this notion is the fact that merlin
interacts with very different subsets of proteins at the two
locations (37, 43).

Finally, we do not know if FERM domain PIP binding
regulates merlin protein-protein interaction, and we are cur-
rently conducting studies to test this hypothesis. It would be
interesting to test if signaling pathways that impinge upon
phosphoinositide homeostasis play a role in regulating mer-
lin function; ones that do may suggest new therapeutic tar-
gets for NF2. Taken together, our data indicate that FERM
domain PIP binding plays a pivotal role in membrane asso-
ciation, subcellular localization, and the growth-suppressive
function of merlin.

FIG. 9. Retargeting the FERM domain PIP binding-deﬁcient mu-
tant merlin into membrane is sufﬁcient to restore the growth-suppres-
sive function to the mutant merlin. (A) Fyn1–10 retargets the mutant
merlin 6N into membrane domains. The ﬁrst 10 amino acids of Fyn
(Fyn1–10; MGCVQCKDKE) contain a dual acylation sequence with a
high afﬁnity for membrane domains. Western immunoblots following
density gradient centrifugation (OptiPrep) of transfected and conﬂu-
ent SC4 cell lysates shows that Fyn1–10 is sufﬁcient to retarget the
mutant merlin 6N into the buoyant 20% and 25% fractions, similar to
proportions of wild-type merlin. Similarly, Fyn1–10 is sufﬁcient to target
the control GFP protein to the 20% and 25% fractions. Caveolin is
mainly found in the buoyant fractions (20% and 25%), whereas trans-
ferrin receptor (TfR) is a marker for the higher-density fractions (30%,
35%, and 40%). We probed for transferrin receptor and caveolin in
each case (data not shown). (B) Retargeting of the mutant merlin 6N
to membrane domains using Fyn1–10 is sufﬁcient to restore the colony
reduction phenotype to the mutant merlin 6N. In a colony formation
assay, SC4 cells transfected with merlin WT had signiﬁcantly decreased
number of colonies compared to cells transfected with vector alone or
mutant merlin 6N following puromycin selection. However, the Fyn1–10
merlin 6N (which retargets the mutant merlin 6N to membrane do-
mains) (A) is sufﬁcient to restore the colony reduction phenotype to
the mutant merlin 6N. Results are representative of two independent
experiments, each performed in triplicate.

membrane or membrane-resident binding partners. Similarly,
the Ras GTPase-activating protein, GAP1IP4BP, which associ-
ates with the membrane via PIP2, is much more mobile when
rendered cytosolic (7). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
of merlin dynamics in mammalian cells using FRAP.

For ezrin, phosphorylation at T567 and activation require
prior PIP2 binding to the FERM domain (3, 14). For merlin,
three major phosphorylation events are known: at S518 by the
p21-activated kinase (29, 30, 66) and protein kinase A (PKA)
(1), at T230 and S315 by Akt (63), and at S10 by PKA (34).
Phosphorylation of merlin at T576, the equivalent of ezrin
T567, has not yet been described in mammals, but in Drosoph-
