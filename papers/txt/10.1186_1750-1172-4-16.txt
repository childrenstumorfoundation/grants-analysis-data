Abstract
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumour-prone disorder characterised by the development of
multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. Prevalence (initially estimated at 1: 200,000) is around 1
in 60,000. Affected individuals inevitably develop schwannomas, typically affecting both vestibular
nerves and leading to hearing loss and deafness. The majority of patients present with hearing loss,
which is usually unilateral at onset and may be accompanied or preceded by tinnitus. Vestibular
schwannomas may also cause dizziness or imbalance as a first symptom. Nausea, vomiting or true
vertigo are rare symptoms, except in late-stage disease. The other main tumours are schwannomas
of the other cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves; meningiomas both intracranial (including optic
nerve  meningiomas)  and  intraspinal,  and  some  low-grade  central  nervous  system  malignancies
(ependymomas). Ophthalmic features are also prominent and include reduced visual acuity and
cataract. About 70% of NF2 patients have skin tumours (intracutaneous plaque-like lesions or more
deep-seated subcutaneous nodular tumours). Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a dominantly inherited
tumour predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. More
than  50%  of  patients  represent  new  mutations  and  as  many  as  one-third  are  mosaic  for  the
underlying disease-causing mutation. Although truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshifts) are
the most frequent germline event and cause the most severe disease, single and multiple exon
deletions  are  common.  A  strategy  for  detection  of  the  latter  is  vital  for  a  sensitive  analysis.
Diagnosis  is  based  on  clinical  and  neuroimaging  studies.  Presymptomatic  genetic  testing  is  an
integral part of the management of NF2 families. Prenatal diagnosis and pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis is possible. The main differential diagnosis of NF2 is schwannomatosis. NF2 represents a
difficult  management  problem  with  most  patients  facing  substantial  morbidity  and  reduced  life
expectancy.  Surgery  remains  the  focus  of  current  management  although  watchful  waiting  with
careful surveillance and occasionally radiation treatment have a role. Prognosis is adversely affected
by early age at onset, a higher number of meningiomas and having a truncating mutation. In the
future, the development of tailored drug therapies aimed at the genetic level are likely to provide
huge improvements for this devastating condition.

Definition
Neurofibromatosis  type  2  (NF2)  is  a  dominantly  inher-
ited tumour prone disorder characterised by the develop-
ment  of  multiple  schwannomas  and  meninigiomas  [1].

The disease can be diagnosed when a pathogenic muta-
tion in the NF2 gene is identified or when the criteria in
table 1[1] are fulfilled.

Epidemiology
When using established clinical diagnostic criteria [1] and
based on mutations in the NF2 gene [2,3] assessment of
the frequency of NF2 in the population can be made. This
is complicated by the high rate of mosaicism [4]. There
have only been two epidemiological studies of NF2 one in
North  West  England  [5,6],  [Evans  DG  et  al.  Birth  inci-
dence and prevalence of tumour prone syndromes: esti-
mates from a UK genetic family register service. Am J Med
Genet  2009.  unpublished]  and  one  in  Finland  [7].  The
incidence  of  NF2  was  initially  reported  as  1:33–40,000
individuals in a 4 million population in England [5]. Dis-
ease prevalence was somewhat lower at 1: 200,000. How-
ever, a recent update suggests that the incidence may be as
high as 1:25,000 [6]. Disease prevalence has now risen to
around 1 in 60,000 due to earlier diagnosis and better sur-
vival  due  to  improved  treatment  [Evans  DG  et  al.  Birth
incidence  and  prevalence  of  tumour  prone  syndromes:
estimates from a UK genetic family register service. Am J
Med Genet 2009. unpublished]. A lower incidence of 1 in
87,410 was reported in a 1.7 million population in Fin-
land [7].

Clinical description
NF2,  in  contrast  to  neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is
characterised by the development of schwannomas, men-
ingiomas and ependymomas, with the great majority of
patients  developing  bilateral  schwannoma  involvement
of  the  superior  vestibular  branch  of  the  eighth  cranial
nerve [1]. Although the disease is still classified as "neu-
rofibromatosis", neurofibromas are relatively infrequent.
The first clear description of NF2 was in 1822 by Wishart
[8]. NF1 was fully delineated in the late nineteenth cen-
tury by von Recklinghausen. However, it was the eminent
Harvey  Cushing,  who  described  bilateral  eighth  nerve
tumours occuring as part of von Recklinghausen disease
in 1916 [9]. This description is largely responsible for the
confusion between the two conditions which continued
for  many  years.  Indeed,  the  literature  prior  to  1985  has
many NF2 cases being described as part of von Reckling-

hausen  disease,  with  bilateral  vestibular  schwannomas
(VS) being included in a major patient series [10].

The hallmark of NF2 is the development of bilateral VS.
VS  usually  present  with  hearing  loss,  tinnitus  or  imbal-
ance or a combination of the three symptoms. The other
main tumour features are schwannomas of the other cra-
nial,  spinal  and  peripheral  nerves;  meningiomas  both
intracranial  (including  optic  nerve  meningiomas)  and
intraspinal;  and  some  low-grade  central  nervous  system
(CNS) malignancies (ependymomas and gliomas). Four
large clinical studies have now confirmed this clinical pic-
ture [1,11-13] (Table 2). Individuals may present with cra-
nial  meningiomas  or  a  spinal  tumour  long  before  the
appearance of a VS.

The majority of individuals with NF2 present with hearing
loss, which is usually unilateral at time of onset. The hear-
ing loss may be accompanied or preceded by tinnitus. VS
may also cause features such as dizziness or imbalance as
the  first  symptom.  Nausea,  vomiting  or  true  vertigo  are
rare symptoms except in late stage disease.

A significant proportion of cases (20–30%) present with
symptoms from an intracranial meningioma (headaches,
seizures), spinal tumour (pain, muscle weakness, paraes-
thesia), or cutaneous tumour [1,11-13]. Indeed, the first
sign of more severe multi-tumour disease in early child-
hood is often a non-8th nerve tumour (including a cutane-
ous  tumour),  or  an  ocular  presentation  [14].  Adult
presentation is thus quite different to paediatric presenta-
tion, in which VS accounts for as little as 15–30% of initial
symptoms. There also appears to be a tendency to monon-
europathy, particularly affecting the facial nerve causing a
Bell's-like palsy, which does not fully recover years before
the detection of a VS. Some children present with a polio-
like illness with wasting of muscle groups in a lower limb,
which again does not fully recover. In adulthood, a more
generalised  symptomtatic  severe  polyneuropathy  occurs
in  about  3–5%  of  patients,  often  associated  with  an
"onion  bulb"  appearance  on  nerve  biopsy  [1].  This  can
progress, leading to severe muscle wasting and even death.
However, around 40% of patients will show evidence of
polyneuropathy on nerve conduction studies [15].

1In Mautner et al., the frequency of optic nerve sheath tumours is for all histological types (i.e., schwannomas and meningiomas).

Ophthalmic features are also prominent in NF2. Patients
often suffer from reduced visual acuity of various causes.
Between  60–80%  of  patients  have  cataracts  [1,10,11],
which are usually presenile posterior subcapsular lenticu-
lar opacities that rarely require removal. However, cortical
wedge  opacities  may  be  present  from  near  birth.  Optic
nerve meningiomas can cause visual loss in the first years
of  life  and  extensive  retinal  hamartomas  can  also  affect
vision.  Misdiagnosis  of  both  of  these  abnormalities  as
retinoblastoma has led to the eye being removed in the
first few years of life.

The skin is a useful aid to diagnosis, but cutaneous fea-
tures in NF2 are much more subtle than in NF1. About
70%  of  NF2  patients  have  skin  tumours,  but  only  10%
have more than ten skin tumours. The tumours appear to
be of at least three different types. The most frequent type
is a plaque-like lesion, which is intra-cutaneous, slightly
raised and more pigmented than surrounding skin, often
with excess hair. More deep-seated subcutaneous nodular
tumours can often be felt, sometimes on major peripheral
nerves. These tumours occur as a fusiform swelling of the
nerve with thickened nerve palpable on either side. There
are  also  occasional  intracutaneous  tumours  similar  to
those  in  NF1.  The  great  majority  of  these  tumours  are

schwannomas, but occasional definite neurofibromas do
occur.

Etiopathogenesis
NF1  and  NF2  were  eventually  recognised  as  separate
genetic and clinical diseases with the localisation of the
respective genes to chromosome 17 and 22 [16,17]. This
was  followed  by  the  formal  clinical  delineation  at  a
National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus meeting in
the USA in 1987 [18]. It is now clear that NF2 is a geneti-
cally  homogeneous  condition,  with  no  evidence  for
another genetic cause of classical NF2 (bilateral VS).

Seizinger et al. were the first to show loss of constitutional
heterozygosity of chromosome 22, with DNA markers lost
in tumours from a patient with NF2 [19]. As such NF2 was
one  of  the  first  inherited  tumour  prone  disorders  to  be
localised  to  a  specific  genetic  location.  Linkage  studies
then confirmed that all affected members of the large fam-
ily carried the same copy of chromosome 22q. The NF2
gene was then isolated by the simultaneous discovery of
constitutional and tumour deletions in a gene coding for
a cell membrane-related protein, which has been termed
merlin or schwannomin by the two groups who isolated
it [2,3].

Constitutional mutations
Standard mutation techniques, such as Single Strand Con-
formational Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis or Denatur-
ing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis, detected between 35%
and 66% of pathogenic mutations [20-23]. The majority
of these mutations were truncating mutations, leading to
a smaller and probably non-functional protein product.
Early  studies  suggested  that  missense  mutations  (which
result in a complete protein product) and large deletions
(which result in no protein product) both caused predom-
inantly mild phenotypes. Larger studies of detailed geno-
type/phenotype  correlations  in  multiple  families  have
confirmed this finding [21-26]. Phenotype is more varia-
ble in patients with splice-site mutations, with milder dis-
ease  in  patients  with  mutations  in  exons  9–15  [26,27].
Definitive  evidence  from  effects  on  survival  have  been
established with missense mutation patients having statis-
tically  greater  survival  than  nonsense  and  frameshift
mutations [26]. As in other tumour prone disorders the
frequency  of  large  genomic  rearrangements  did  not
become  apparent  until  some  time  after  the  gene  was
cloned, due to the poor availability of methods to allow
routine clinical screening for their presence. About half of
these  are  detectable  with  standard  cytogenetic  analysis
with FISH [28]. A small number of constitutional abnor-
malities such as chromosome translocations and ring 22
would  still  need  a  cytogenetic  analysis  to  confirm  their
presence. The majority of large scale rearrangements are
now routinely detected by Multiplex Ligation-dependant
Probe Amplification (MLPA) and are known to account
for around 15% of NF2 germline aberrations [28,29]. The
commonest of this class of mutations is a deletion of the
NF2 promoter, exon 1 and most of intron 1 and deletions
of the  whole  gene, indeed combined these  two account
for over half of all MLPA abnormalities (Table 3). The dif-
fering  frequency  of  the  various  types  of  NF2  mutation
between familial, sporadic and mosaic cases can be seen
in  Table  4.  This  represents  the  output  from  one  centre
dedicated to whole gene analysis with the great majority
of patients having been screened by a technique capable
of the detection of large deletions or duplications. More
extensive lists of NF2 mutations described worldwide are
available online and in recent reviews [30-32], but these
are less likely to reflect the true ratios of different classes
of  mutations,  as  a  variety  of  different  techniques  have
been  used.  The  sensitivity  of  genetic  testing  using
sequence analysis and MLPA can be derived from column
1 (Table 1). Ninety-three per cent of mutations have been
identified in the second generation of NF2 families. Of the
missing  eight  families  six  have  been  subjected  to  more
detailed  analysis  including  RNA  analysis.  Two  putative
splicing variants deep in the introns have been identified
based  on  Protein  Truncation  Testing  and  intronic
sequencing  (Messaien  L,  personal  communication),  but
no other mutations have been found.

A  considerable  proportion  of  NF2  patients,  particularly
milder cases, have mosaic disease, in which only a propor-
tion of cells contain the mutated NF2 gene. The initiating
mutation occurs after conception, leading to two separate
cell lineages. The proportion of cells affected depends on
how  early  in  development  the  mutation  occurs.  Recent
evidence suggests that up to 20–30% of NF2 cases without
a  family  history  of  the  disease  are  mosaic,  carrying  the
mutation in too small a proportion or none of their lym-
phocytes to be detected from a blood sample [4,33-35].
This accounts for the milder disease course in many indi-
viduals with unfound mutations, and since only a subset
of germ cells (or none) will carry the mutation, there is
less than a 50% risk of transmitting the disease to their
offspring.  However,  if  an  offspring  has  inherited  the
mutation, they will have a typical phenotype and usually
be more severely affected than their parent, since the off-
spring will carry the mutation in all of their cells. One of
the features that suggested that mosaicism existed in NF2
was that NF2 mutations were harder to find in blood in
isolated  non  inherited  cases  than  in  patients  who  had
inherited the disease from an affected parent. Mosaicism
may be particularly likely in NF2 if the tumours are pre-
dominantly on one side of the body. The mosaic muta-
tion can be detected by analysing tumour material from
an affected individual. If an identical mutation is found in
two tumours from that individual, their offspring can be
tested  for  the  presence  of  the  mutation.  Also  when  two
alterations,  either:  two  mutations  or  one  mutation  plus
one allele loss, are found in on tumour, one of these must
be the constitutional one. Thus offspring can be tested for
both  abnormalities  and  potentially  exclude  inheriting
NF2.

C > T transitions leading to a nonsense mutation are the
most common mutations in the NF2 gene [30-32]. These
account for the only significant variation in mutation fre-
quency across the NF2 gene apart from the lack of muta-
tions in exons 16 and 17 and a relatively low frequency in
exon 9 [30].

Somatic mutations
There  are  notable  similarities,  but  also  differences
between  the  distribution  and  type  of  germline  and
somatic  NF2  mutations.  Among  germline  mutations  in
classic NF2, nonsense mutations are more common than
frameshift mutations by a ratio of 1.3:1, but this ratio is
reversed  for  somatic  mutations  [36].  In  both  situations
NF2  nonsense  mutations,  C  >  T  transitions  in  CGA
codons and non-CGA codons are the most common sin-
gle  base-pair  transitions.  However  there  is  a  marked
absence of mutations in exons 14 and 15 in sporadic men-
ingioma.  One  recently  reported  phenomenon  is  the
increasing drift from nonsense mutations in the germline
and  early  somatic  mutations  to  a  predominance  of

frameshift  mutations  in  the  tumours  of  older  patients
with vestibular schwannoma [36]. This is likely to be due
to a deficiency in certain DNA repair pathways in older
patients [36].

Although  it  is  thought  that  effectively  all  schwannomas
require  inactivation  of  the  NF2  gene,  no  reports  apart
from those studying NF2 protein have confirmed a 100%

knock out of both copies of the NF2 gene. This is likely to
be due to diversity of mechanisms that inactivate the gene.
The standard approach of mutational analysis and Loss of
Constitutional  Heterozygosity  (LOH)  on  tumours  will
detect involvement of NF2 in about 80–90% of schwan-
nomas, but both copies can only be confirmed as affected
in about 50–60% of cases. The mechanism of LOH is also
not  straightforward,  whilst  most  cases  involve  loss  of

chromosome 22 or at least the long arm, a proportion are
now  known  to  be  due  to  mitotic  recombination  with
essentially  two  identical  copies  of  a  mutated  NF2  gene
and distal 22q [37]. This mechanism is now thought to be
a primary cause of NF2 inactivation in schwannomatosis.
It  is  now  known  that  between  20–40%  of  sporadic
schwannomas are inactivated by NF2 methylation [38,39]
and in a similar fashion to TP16 this could involve both
copies of NF2 and explain why some tumours do not har-
bour identifiable point mutations or LOH. Approximately
60%  of  sporadic  meningiomas  have  NF2  gene  involve-
ment and promoter methylation again plays a significant
role [40].

Differential diagnosis
The main differential diagnosis of NF2 is schwannomato-
sis and some patients with multiple non cranial schwan-
nomas  turn  out  to  have  mosaic  NF2  [34,35].  However,
patients  fulfilling  the  most  sensitive  Manchester  criteria
are unlikely to be misclassified [43].

Diagnosis
The  Manchester  (modified  NIH)  diagnostic  criteria  for
NF2 are shown in Table 1. The original NIH criteria have
been expanded to include patients with no family history
who have multiple schwannomas and or meningiomas,
but  who  have  not  yet  developed  bilateral  8th  nerve
tumours. Patients who have asymmetric involvement are
likely to be mosaic [41]. At very young ages (< 18 years)
individuals presenting with an apparently isolated menin-
gioma  [14]  or  vestibular  schwannoma  [42]  are  have  a
20% and 10% likelihood respectively of developing NF2.
However after 20 years of age this rate drops dramatically
and the diagnosis becomes very unlikely after 30 years of
age [42].

Antenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling
NF2  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disease  with  usually  a
50% risk of transmission from an affected individual to
their offspring. This was first confirmed in a large family
reported  by  Gardner  and  Frazier  in  1930.  50–60%  of
patients  have  no  family  history  and  represent  de  novo
mutations in the NF2 gene [1-3]. Individuals who inherit
a pathogenic mutation in the NF2 gene will almost always
develop symptoms by 60 years of age [7]. Exceptionally,
patients particularly in the pre MRI era will have not been
diagnosed  in  their  lifetime.  Although  the  transmission
rate is 50% in the second generation and beyond, the risk
of  transmission  in  an  apparently  isolated  patient  with
NF2 is less than 50% due to mosaicism [4].

Diagnostic methods

in improving the clinical management of NF2, pre-symp-

tomatic genetic testing is an integral part of the manage-
ment  of  NF2  families.  Once  a  mutation  has  been
identified in an affected individual, a 100% specific test is
available  for  the  family.  However,  mutation  screening
may not reveal the causative mutation. Predictive diagno-
sis by linkage analysis using intragenic markers or markers
flanking the NF2 gene is also possible in the great majority
of families with two or more living affected individuals. In
the  absence  of  a  genetic  test  a  cumulative  age  at  onset
curve  [44]  can  be  used.  Age  at  onset  curves  aid  genetic
counselling; for example, the risk of having inherited NF2
for  an  asymptomatic  at-risk  individual  25  years  of  age,
prior to screening, drops to 25%. The risk to an unaffected
30 year old with a normal scan would be < 10%. Tumour
analysis plays a vital role in providing genetic testing for
the offspring of sporadic patients. Indeed analysis should
if possible first be carried out on tumour so that a targeted
approach can be used on the blood sample. If both muta-
tional events are identified in the NF2 gene in a tumour
and neither  is present  in  the  blood  the  patient  must be
mosaic for one of these mutations [33-35,45,46]. Even if
only LOH is identified this still allows exclusion of NF2 in
50% of offspring if they can be shown to have inherited
the allele "lost" in the tumour [35,46]. At-risk individuals
who  are  shown  not  to  have  inherited  the  mutated  NF2
gene do not need further follow-up.

Even in the absence of identifying a mutation the residual
risk of NF2 can be substantially reduced in the child of an
apparently isolated case. In particular patients presenting
with asymmetric disease over 40 years of age with negative

mutation analysis in blood would have a very low chance
of transmitting NF2 to their children (Table 5).

Because of the severity of NF2 there is a demand for pre-
natal  diagnosis  and  pre-implantation  genetic  diagnosis.
Use of the techniques above means that this is possible in
the great majority of families.

Screening protocol
Children of affected patients should be considered to be
at 50% risk of NF2 and screening for NF2 can start at birth.
Cataracts can affect vision in early life and other tumour
implications are present in the first ten years of life, partic-
ularly  cranial  meningiomas.  Formal  screening  for  VS
should  start  at  ten  years,  as  it  is  rare  for  tumours  to
become  symptomatic  before  that  time  even  in  severely
affected  families.  Annual  audiological  tests  including
auditory brainstem response are still a useful adjunct to
MRI  [44].  Surgery  is  unlikely  to  be  more  successful  for
tumours < 6 mm than for tumours sized 6 mm, but VS
growth is higher in younger patients, so for asymptomatic
at-risk individuals without tumours, MRI screening every
two years for those < 20 years old and every 3–5 years for
those age > 20 years should be sufficient. The initial MRI
scan  could be at around  12  years  of  age,  or  10 years in
severely affected families. Once tumours are present, MRI
screening  should  probably  be  at  least  annual.  Spinal
tumours are seen in 60–80% of NF2 patients on MRI [47-
50]. While only 25–30% of patients with spinal tumours
require a spinal operation from a symptomatic tumour, a
full annual neurological examination is probably a wise
precaution with Spinal MRI only every 3 years or if there

are new symptoms. If no tumours are present on the ini-
tial scan a further scan 5–10 years later may be reasonable.

In most families it is now possible to develop a genetic test
so that screening can be targeted to affected individuals
only. Identifying the affected patient's mutation not only
allows testing of at risk relatives, but may also give impor-
tant indicators as to the patient's own prognosis. As 25–
30% of NF2 patients are mosaic frozen tumour should be
taken at operation (with patient consent) for genetic tests.

NF2 management
NF2 presents many difficult management dilemmas. The
mainstay  of  management  of  NF2  is  surgical  removal  of
symptomatic  cranial  and  spinal  tumours.  The  timing  of
removal  of  vestibular  schwannomas  is  a  more  difficult
area.  Surgical  results  are  certainly  far  better  when  man-
aged by an experienced team [50-52]. There is clear evi-
dence  of  a  reduction  in  mortality  with  a  significantly
increased life expectancy for NF2 patients managed at 3
specialty centres in the UK (OR 0.34) [53]. It is important
to  balance  the  use  of  microsurgery  and  radiation  treat-
ment, which can have a role in patients who have particu-
larly aggressive tumours, or who are poor surgical risks, or
who refuse surgery. Teams experienced in the positioning
of brainstem implants can offer partial auditory rehabili-
tation  to  those  who  are  deaf,  although  results  are  still
behind those achievable for cochlear implants. Although
the cochlear nerve may be left initially intact after surgery
its  blood  supply  may  be  damaged,  nonetheless  a  few
patients can be rehabilitated successfully with a cochlear
implant.

Outcomes
Even with improvements in microsurgery and with use of
radiation therapy, the great majority of individuals with
NF2  become  completely  deaf.  The  tumours  in  NF2  are
more difficult to treat than those of sporadic unilateral VS,
as NF2 VS are often multifocal, appearing "like a bunch of
grapes" around the vestibular nerve in particular. There is
evidence for a histological difference, with NF2 VS being
more lobular and less vascular then their sporadic coun-
terparts  [54].  This  leads  to  a  greater  risk  of  facial  nerve
damage in NF2. Loss of facial nerve function is one of the
most feared aspects of the condition for many sufferers,
although in good surgical hands this complication is now
much less common [50,52]. Patients may also be severely
disabled by a combination of poor balance, visual prob-
lems and weakness due to spinal tumours. Indeed, many
NF2  patients  become  wheelchair-bound  in  early  adult-
hood.  Many  patients  with  multi-tumour  disease  die  in
their twenties and thirties. In view of the multiplicity of
problems  affecting  many  patients  it  is  strongly  recom-
mended that NF2 patients are managed by a multidiscipli-
nary team in specialist centres [52].

Specialty centres
A typical NF2 specialist centre will require involvement of
a number of key staff members.

Permanent clinic staff
Neurosurgeon, Otolaryngologist, physician (neurologist/
geneticist),  clinic  nurse/patient  link  worker  and  a  dedi-
cated clinic secretary.

Clinic  equipment:  lightwriter/pallantype/voice  activated
software.

In order to minimise patient visits morning scanning with
lunchtime radiological review and an afternoon clinic is
preferable.

Each clinic should have access to a named
Neuroradiologist, ophthalmologist, peripheral nerve sur-
geon,  plastic  surgeon,  neurologist/geneticist  (if  not
involved in main clinic), hearing therapist, physiothera-
pist, paediatrician.

Patients should be given the option of a radiation therapy
opinion, which will only be available at a few centres.

Managing affected children
NF2  is  being  recognised  more  and  more  frequently  in
childhood often before VS have developed. Recognition
of the more severe disease course with early presentation
and the more atypical features such as mononeuropathy
are important.

Surgery
VS in NF2 are more difficult to treat than those of sporadic
unilateral VS because NF2-related VS are often multifocal
in the eighth nerve complex, and the potential for associ-
ated facial nerve schwannomas. Surgery to remove VS in
NF2 almost always leads to total deafness with loss of the
cochlear nerve. Despite the great improvement in VS sur-
gery over the last three decades, facial nerve damage and
other adverse outcomes remain a real possibility during
tumour  removal,  especially  in  the  hands  of  less  experi-
enced  VS  surgeons.  Facial  weakness  may  threaten  the
health of the eye as a result of loss of the protective blink
reflex.  and as the  lacrimal  gland  is also  supplied  by the
facial nerve the loss of tear production will increase this
risk. If facial nerve damage coexists with loss of corneal
sensation from damage to the trigeminal nerve then the
eye  becomes  exceptionally  vulnerable  to  corneal  ulcera-
tion and blindness.

The cornerstone of modern NF2 management is conserva-
tion of function, and the maintenance of "quality of life".
The mere presence of a tumour is not an indication for its
removal.  Serious  thought  must  be  given  to  the  benefits

http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16

that are sought and the risks and complications of the sur-
gery, and the treatment must be tailored to the needs of
the individual patient [52]. Attempts at hearing preserva-
tion surgery should be limited to experienced centres who
can offer a realistic chance of maintaining both the coch-
lear nerve, but also cochlea function. If hearing is lost after
apparent cochlear nerve preservation the patient may still
be suitable for a cochlear implant. In many if not most
instances the best policy will be to observe VS to decide on
the  best  time  to  balance  surgical  morbidity  against  the
almost inevitable loss of hearing.

The  principle  of  minimal  interference  for  VS  applies
equally  to  schwannomas  on  other  cranial  nerves,  to
intracranial  meningiomas,  and  to  spinal  tumours.  It  is
very uncommon to have to remove a schwannoma grow-
ing on a cranial nerve other than the eighth because these
tumours  appear  to  have  a  much  slower  growth  pattern
than NF2 VS.  Spinal  tumours are mostly considered for
excision if they are clearly producing symptoms or physi-
cal  signs.  In  the  absence  of  any  dramatic  growth  of
tumours, the head should be scanned every year and the
spine every 3 years.

Radiation therapy
It  is  important  to  balance  the  use  of  microsurgery  and
radiation treatment, which has a role in patients who are
poor surgical candidates, or who refuse or wish to avoid
surgery because of its associated risks. Radiation therapy
should be mentioned as a management option, even if the
tumour is larger than the size criterion for treatment. The
upper limit of size for radiotherapy is generally a maxi-
mum  intracranial  diameter  of  3  cm  [55].  The  patient
should be aware of the management options even if the
tumour is not suitable for a particular treatment modality.
In  NF2  cases  selected  for  radiosurgery  tumour  control
rates are of the order of 50%, with 40% retaining pre-treat-
ment hearing for at least 3 years [56]. This is nonetheless
substantially worse than for sporadic vestibular schwan-
nomas.

Surgeons should use clinical judgement as to when to rec-
ommend radiation therapy [52]. Follow-up for life with
interval  scanning  is  necessary,  although  this  would  be
required for NF2 anyway. Patients should be made aware
of  the  variable  reported  outcomes  of  the  treatment  and
the risk of the radiation-induced malignant change, which
has been reported disproportionately more in NF2 than
sporadic patients [57,58]. The tumour may also be more
difficult  to  excise  after  radiotherapy,  and  that  reported
facial nerve outcomes after surgery following stereotactic
radiation therapy are frequently poor [59].

New therapies
The NF2 protein appears to impact on multiple intracellu-
lar signalling pathways. These pathways include the PI3-

kinase/Akt,  Raf/MEK/ERK  and  mTOR  pathways  [60].  In
particular, studies using NF2-derived tumour tissue reveal
elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt. More recently, Akt-
dependent phosphorylation of Merlin on 2 residues (Thr-
230  and  Ser-315)  has  been  shown  to  target  Merlin  for
ubiquitin-dependent  degradation.  Although  no  PI3
kinase or Akt inhibitors have yet been approved for treat-
ment,  there  are  multiple  compounds  in  development  –
primarily  for  oncology  indications.  The  Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway  has  been  implicated  in  NF2  tumorigenesis  in
part through identification of elevated levels of phospho-
ERK and phospho-MEK.

The  progress  being  made  in  cellular  research  especially
with regard to pathways in which the NF2 gene product
interacts raises the hopes of targeted therapy. Targeting the
ERK1/, AKT, integrin/focal adhesion kinase/Src/Ras sign-
aling  cascades,  PDGFRbeta,  phosphatidylinositol  3-
kinase/protein  kinase  C/Src/c-Raf  pathway,  VEG-F  and
other pathways [60,61] means that drugs such as avastin,
elotinib [62], lapatinib and sorafenib [63] may well bear
fruit.

Prognosis
NF2  remains  a  life  limiting  and  life  spoiling  condition.
Patients diagnosed prior to 1990 had only a 15 year life
expectancy from diagnosis [1,64]. Improvement in man-
agement  and  early  diagnosis  are  improving  these  out-
comes  but  many  people  with  NF2  still  die  very  young.
Prognosis  is  adversely  affected  by  early  age  at  onset,
number of meningiomas and having a truncating muta-
tion [52].

Unresolved questions

1. What is the most appropriate molecular/cell biolog-
ical target(s) for therapy

2.  What  are  the  long  term  safety  issues  of  radiation
treatments  and  does  fractionated  radiotherapy  offer
advantages over sterotactic or gamma knife treatment

Conclusion
NF2 remains a condition that is life spoiling and life lim-
iting. Multidisciplinary management with early diagnosis
are  mainstays  of  management.  Hopefully  new  targeted
therapies  will  revolutionise  the  outcomes  in  this  condi-
tion.
