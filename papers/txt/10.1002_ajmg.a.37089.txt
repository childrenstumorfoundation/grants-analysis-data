Abstract

“The Third International Meeting on Genetic Disorders in the RAS/MAPK Pathway: Towards a 
Therapeutic Approach” was held at the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld Hotel (August 2–4, 
2013). Seventy-one physicians and scientists attended the meeting, and parallel meetings were 
held by patient advocacy groups (CFC International, Costello Syndrome Family Network, NF 
Network and Noonan Syndrome Foundation). Parent and patient advocates opened the meeting 
with a panel discussion to set the stage regarding their hopes and expectations for therapeutic 
advances. In keeping with the theme on therapeutic development, the sessions followed a 
progression from description of the phenotype and definition of therapeutic endpoints, to 
definition of genomic changes, to identification of therapeutic targets in the RAS/MAPK pathway,

INTRODUCTION: THE RAS/MAPK PATHWAY DISORDERS

Molecular genetic discoveries have shown that a group of genetic syndromes with 
phenotypic overlap are caused by germline mutations perturbing RAS/mitogen activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling [Rauen, 2013]. The disorders currently known to involve 
germline mutation of genes that encode proteins in the RAS/MAPK pathway are 
summarized in Table I. Although each disorder presents a distinct constellation of clinical 
problems, there are significant areas of overlap, including: (i) central nervous system 
dysfunction, resulting in particular learning difficulties and/or various degrees of intellectual 
disability; (ii) cardiovascular abnormalities, variously affecting the heart, blood vessels, and 
lymphatics; (iii) abnormalities of skeletal development; (iv) craniofacial anomalies and 
dysmorphia; (v) cutaneous lesions, including tumors, pigmentary changes, abnormal skin 
texture, and vascular malformations; and (vi) risk of benign and/or malignant tumors. The 
RAS/MAPK pathway plays a central role in the signal transduction of extracellular stimuli, 
principally through receptor tyrosine kinases, to the intracellular compartment [De Luca et 
al., 2012]. The pathway is critical for many cellular processes, including cancer biology, as 
somatic pathway mutations are observed in approximately 30% of malignancies [Bos, 
1989]. It is also vital for human development, as evidenced by the craniofacial, cardiac, 
ectodermal, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system defects shared by 
the heritable RAS/MAPK disorders.

Session 1: RAS/MAPK Pathway Phenotypes and Therapeutic Goals

Defining of the phenotypes of the various RAS/MAPK pathway disorders is a necessary 
prerequisite to initiating therapeutic trials. Knowledge of the phenotypes and natural history 
will identify priorities for treatment and inform the identification of endpoints to judge 
efficacy. The session on RAS/MAPK Phenotypes and Therapeutic Goals was chaired by 
Drs. Karen W. Gripp (DuPont Hospital for Children) and Judith Allanson (Children’s 
Hospital of Eastern Ontario). Speakers were encouraged to identify major priorities for 
therapeutic trials in each of the disorders.

Dr. Scott Plotkin (Massachusetts General Hospital) described an international collaboration 
to define clinical trial endpoints in neurofibromatosis, a program called REiNS (Response 
Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis). He emphasized the importance of 
working closely with the FDA to identify endpoints that might be acceptable to approve 
clinical use of a drug. The REiNS collaboration includes working groups on imaging 
endpoints, functional endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, whole body MRI, visual 
endpoints for optic pathway glioma, neurocognitive endpoints, and biomarkers. Aside from 
working collaboratively with the FDA, he stressed the importance of international

collaboration and identification of intermediate endpoints to permit trial completion in a 
reasonable time period.

Dr. Emma Burkitt Wright (University of Manchester) described the cardiofaciocutaneous 
syndrome (CFC) phenotype. This condition is genetically heterogeneous, with mutations in 
BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, and KRAS. Some genotype–phenotype differences have been 
established, which will be important to take into account in organizing clinical trials. Major 
priorities for therapy include feeding problems, irritability, seizures, limited mobility and 
exercise intolerance, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Dr. Bronwyn Kerr (University of Manchester, UK) spoke on phenotypic features of Costello 
syndrome. This syndrome includes neurocognitive, cardiovascular and physical changes, 
including a significantly increased malignancy risk. More than 80% of affected individuals 
have cardiac problems, including congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia 
[Lin et al., 2011]. Various activating mutations in HRAS have been identified, with some 
specific mutations predicting severity of manifestations. Therapeutic priorities include 
cardiomyopathy, adaptive behavior, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and irritability. It was 
noted, however, that families tend to find children with Costello syndrome to have a 
pleasant social manner, and may be concerned about negative changes in behavior as an 
unintended consequence of treatment.

Dr. Amy Roberts (Boston Children’s Hospital) spoke about the phenotype of Noonan 
syndrome. Therapeutic priorities are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, short stature, and 
learning disability. Twenty to thirty percent of affected individuals have hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, with some specific mutations more likely associated with this complication 
[Lee et al., 2011]. There have been encouraging preclinical studies in mouse models using 
MEK inhibitors. Short stature has been treated with growth hormone, leading to significant 
height gain. Neurocognitive problems exhibit some genotype–phenotype correlations. It was 
noted that learning improves in patients when stimuli are spaced far apart in time.

Session 2: Genomic Approaches

Identification of the genes underlying the various disorders has been of key importance in 
elucidating biological mechanisms. Dr. Ludwine Messiaen (University of Alabama at 
Birmingham) moderated the session on genomic approaches. She began the session with a 
description of genetic studies of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Over 2,500 distinct 
pathogenic NF1 variants have been identified; most lead to haploinsuffiency, though a 
considerable proportion (~16%) are missense variants. The latter present a challenge; family 
and functional studies are needed to classify them as pathogenic versus benign variants. 
Some genotype–phenotype correlations have been established, especially a severe 
phenotype associated with the constitutional 1.4 Mb microdeletion and absence of 
neurofibromas in those with a three base pair deletion in exon 17 [Upadhyaya et al., 2007]. 
Efforts are underway to perform more detailed analysis of genotype–phenotype correlations 
to confirm suggested associations or reveal new ones. She also reviewed studies of Legius 
syndrome, in which pigmentary features overlap with those of NF1 but tumors do not occur, 
due to mutation in SPRED1, which also encodes a RAS/MAPK protein.

Dr. Reza Ahmadian (Heinrich–Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany) discussed structure–
function relationships in mutations involving RAS, contrasting those associated with cancer 
with those associated with developmental disorders. Modulation of RAS function is 
complicated by a number of factors, including the complexity of the signaling pathway, the 
occurrence of multiple RAS isoforms, interactions with additional new modulatory proteins, 
diverse activation mechanisms, and various cellular compartments where RAS proteins are 
found. Dr. Conxi Lázaro (Catalan Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain) described her 
work on the use of morpholinos (antisense oligonucleotides) as a therapeutic approach to 
treat cells from NF1 patients harboring a special type of splicing mutation (deep intronic 
mutation) to restore the correct function of the mutated NF1 protein, neurofibromin. In cells 
from these NF1 patients her group demonstrated a restoration of the normal splicing and 
demonstrated reduction of RAS-GTP levels [Pros et al., 2009; Fernández-Rodríguez et al., 
2011]. In NF1, more than 30% of pathogenic variants affect the correct splicing of the gene, 
although a few proportion are deep intronic mutations; it has to be demonstrated if this 
approach can be used for other splice mutations as well. Challenges include the fact that 
each variant would require a specific oligonucleotide (morpholino or similar) and that these 
morpholinos would need to be delivered reliably to the cells. There is also a need for 
relevant preclinical models. Dr. Yoko Aoki (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) discussed 
efforts to identify pathogenic variants in patients with Noonan syndrome in whom no 
pathogenic variant had been found in the known genes. Whole exome sequencing revealed 
four that were noted to pathogenic variants in RIT1, which encodes a 25-kD protein in the 
RAS family. Altogether, pathogenic variants were found in 17/180 affected individuals. 
Most had congenital heart defects, and this phenotype is replicated in a zebrafish model.

Session 3: RAS Pathway Biology and Identification of Therapeutic Targets Moderators

Detection of mutations in genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway opened the door to 
understanding of pathogenesis and identification of therapeutic targets. The session on this 
topic was led by Drs. Ype Elgersma (ERASmus University) and Alcino Silva (University of 
California, Los Angeles). A keynote talk on drug discovery was provided by Dr. G. Sitta 
Sittampalam (NIH), who described the TRND Program (Therapeutics for Rare and 
Neglected Diseases) within The National Center for Advancing Translational Science 
(NCATS) at NIH. The program is intended to encourage and speed the development of new 
drugs for rare and neglected diseases through collaborations with scientists at NIH, 
academia, nonprofit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
Through these, collaborative efforts can be advanced to preclinical development and 
ultimately to clinical trials. A program focusing on the RAS/MAPK pathway is in progress. 
Other programs at NCATS of interest to the rare disease community include the BrIDGs 
Program (Bridging Interventional Development Gaps) to overcome obstacles in late stage 
preclinical development and the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network that supports 
studies therapeutic endpoints and clinical trials.

Dr. Silva described his work on preclinical targeting of neurocognitive deficits associated 
with RASopathies using mouse models. He showed evidence that RAS signaling can affect 
both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that cognitive phenotypes are not necessarily due 
to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but may be caused instead by changes in adult mice.

He presented evidence that increased RAS activity in either inhibitory or excitatory neurons 
leads to deficits in long-term potentiation, and that these deficits can be reversed with statins 
or with MEK inhibitors. Dr. Elgersma discussed results with a Costello syndrome mouse 
model based on an HRAS activating mutation. The animals demonstrate neurocognitive 
deficits by mechanisms that differ from those in Nf1 mutant mice. He further showed that 
the NF1 protein interacts with the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 
(HCN) channel and that attenuation of the HCN current, together with increased MAPK-
dependent synapsin phosphorylation, leads to increased inhibition seen in the Nf1 mutants. 
Their studies highlight that different disorders in the RAS/MAPK pathway may exhibit 
neurocognitive defects by distinct mechanisms.

Dr. Sonia Mulero-Navarro (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) described work with 
induced pluripotent stem cell lines from patients with Noonan syndrome to model disorders 
of myelopoiesis and cardiovascular development. She modeled juvenile myelomonocytic 
leukemia in this system and demonstrated upregulation of two micro RNAs. 
Cardiomyocytes developed from iPS cells from patients with Noonan syndrome with 
multiple lentigines show an abnormal phenotype that can be rescued with rapamycin.

Session 4: Preclinical Drug Development and Testing

The RAS/MAPK pathway has been targeted for drug discovery due to its importance in 
cancer, and this opened the way to preclinical tests in developmental disorders as well. Dr. 
Bruce Gelb (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) moderated this session. Dr. Gelb 
described a preclinical model for RAF1 mutation using Drosophila. His group is screening 
for drugs that rescue pupal lethality in mutant flies. Dr. Maria Kontaridis (Harvard Medical 
School) described a mouse model based on PTPN11 mutation that replicates many features 
of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML, formerly LEOPARD syndrome). 
Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway was noted, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 
these animals is reversed by rapamycin treatment. She noted that a child with severe 
cardiomyopathy and NSML improved with everolimus treatment, at which point a heart 
transplant could be performed. Dr. Amy Roberts noted a clinical trial initiated based on this 
approach. Dr. Benjamin Neel (Ontario Institute for Cancer Research) described work with 
an activating Raf1 mutation mouse model, which developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
The phenotype is rescued with postnatal treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Using a Cre-
inducible system that targets different cell types in the heart they showed that involvement 
of both cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells is required to produce the full cardiomyopathy. 
They also developed iPS cells that model aspects of the cardiac phenotype, which are 
rescued by treatment with MEK inhibitor.

Session 5: Clinical Trials

Clinical trials began based on progress in identification of therapeutic targets and preclinical 
studies. This session was led by Dr. Katherine Rauen (UCSF). Dr. Bruce Korf (University of 
Alabama at Birmingham) described the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium 
(http://cdmrp.army.mil/nfrp/consortium/trialDetails.shtml), which is funded by the 
Department of Defense. The Consortium includes 17 sites in the US and 1 in Australia and 
is charged to perform clinical trials in NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. The rationale for

the Consortium is that clinical trials for rare disorders are best conducted when multiple 
centers pool their resources to increase patient enrollment. Several trials have been 
completed by the Consortium, and additional trials are in progress.

Dr. Reymundo Lozano (UC Davis) discussed his experience in clinical trials for fragile X 
syndrome. Though this condition is not a member of the RAS/MAPK pathway disorders, his 
experience may inform efforts to treat other rare disorders. He discussed ongoing and 
completed trials and related challenges, including dosing, drug safety, and definition of 
therapeutic endpoints. Dr. Chao Zhang (Plexxikon) spoke about efforts to test drugs 
targeting BRAF in melanoma. He noted a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in 
tumors treated with BRAF inhibitors, leading to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and 
keratocanthomas. A new class of BRAF inhibitors does not have this effect. Dr. Calum 
MacRae (Brigham and Women’s Hospital) described an open-label proof of concept trial of 
a MEK inhibitor in 15 patients with Noonan syndrome. The study targets hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and evaluation takes place after 6 months of treatment.

Session 6: Infrastructure to Support Therapeutic Development

The RAS/MAPK disorders are rare individually, which creates a challenge in conducting 
clinical research and clinical trials. This session, chaired by Dr. Amy Roberts (Children’s 
Hospital, Boston) was intended to explore the infrastructure needs to facilitate research. Dr. 
Annette Bakker (Children’s Tumor Foundation) described the therapeutic pipeline put in 
place to facilitate development of treatments for neurofibromatosis. CTF provides funding to 
basic science and clinical investigators, as well as for patient and professional education. It 
has been proactive in facilitating preclinical drug testing, partnering with the pharmaceutical 
industry, and developing a patient registry and biobank. Dr. Corinne Linardic (Duke 
University School of Medicine) described the tissue bank set up as a central facility to 
support research with the Children’s Oncology Group. Tissues are accessioned centrally 
under IRB-approved protocols, processed, and then available to investigators for research. 
Brian Denger (Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy) described their patient registry - 
DuchenneConnect. This is a structured database into which parents, rather than physicians, 
enter data. The database is intended to serve as a resource both for clinicians and 
researchers, and is maintained on a platform provided by Patient Crossroads. The registry 
also serves as an educational resource for families to include Fact Sheets about aspects of 
the condition and treatment options as well as regular webinars concerning current care and 
research issues.

CONCLUSIONS

The RAS signaling pathway first came to light through studies of cancer, but it has become 
clear that germline mutations that lead to activation of the MAPK pathway lead to a group 
of developmental disorders; some, but not all, include a predisposition to cancer. The 
conditions have overlapping phenotypes, but each also has distinct features. The possibility 
of therapy aimed at reduction of activity of RAS signaling is now within reach, but will 
require careful consideration of the individual phenotypes and therapeutic goals, definition 
of clear endpoints, and collaborative efforts to conduct both preclinical studies and clinical
