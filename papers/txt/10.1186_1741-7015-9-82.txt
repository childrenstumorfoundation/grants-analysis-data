Abstract

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent genetic disease characterized by multiple benign
tumours with increased risk for malignancy. There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients.
Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction were applied to investigate
expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs.
These mice do not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including deregulation of
cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1 tumours require for their growth the master regulator
of cartilage differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific genes deregulated in an
Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by
analyzing expression of the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour and
serum samples of NF1 patients.
Results: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in
all NF1-related tumours and its serum levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls.
Among NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform neurofibromas and in
those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without
such tumours. Most notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden.
Conclusions: MIA is a potential serum biomarker of tumour load in NF1 patients which could be useful in
following the disease course and monitoring the efficacy of therapies.

Background
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder
resulting from mutations in the NF1 tumour suppressor
gene. Susceptibility to neoplastic transformation is the
main feature of the disease [1]. The most frequent tumours
in NF1 are dermal neurofibromas, which can be found in
more than 90% of adult patients [2]. Approximately 50% of
NF1 patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs),
which can undergo malignant transformation into malig-
nant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) [3-6].
MPNSTs are highly malignant tumours with a poor

prognosis. The lifetime risk of developing MPNSTs in the
NF1 patient is 8% to 13% [7].

Major challenges in clinical practice are to determine
tumour burden and to monitor the disease course. While
cutaneous neurofibromas are visible on physical exami-
nation, the diagnosis of pNFs, especially internal ones,
depends on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is
costly and laborious. Furthermore, early diagnosis is cru-
cial for complete resection of MPNSTs, which is up to
now the only curative treatment [8]. A biomarker for
assessment of tumour burden and detection of malignant
transformation would therefore be of interest.

Previously, we and others have shown that loss of Nf1
gene function during murine embryogenesis causes
defects of bone and cartilage development [9,10]. One of
the observed molecular changes in Nf1-deficient

embryonic cartilage was an upregulation and persistently
nuclear localization of the transcription factor SOX9.
Interestingly, SOX9 was also recently found to be
expressed in NF1-related tumours, where it supports cel-
lular survival [11]. As a master regulator of cartilage dif-
ferentiation, SOX9 regulates expression of various
downstream target genes, including collagen type 2a1,
collagen type 11a2, aggrecan and melanoma-inhibitory
activity (MIA). The last, MIA, is also known as cartilage-
derived retinoic acid sensitive protein (cd-rap) and was
originally isolated as a secretory factor from supernatants
of melanoma cell cultures [12]. MIA serum level was
found to correlate with melanoma spreading [13] and
was proposed as a biomarker for monitoring the course
of disease and the efficacy of therapies [14]. Various
other tumours, predominantly those of neuroectodermal,
glial origin, also express MIA [15]. Recombinant MIA
inhibits melanoma cell growth and cell attachment in
vitro [16]. Subsequent studies revealed that MIA interacts
with extracellular matrix components, laminin and fibro-
nectin, as well as with cellular matrix receptors integrin
a5, integrin a4 [17] and cadherin 7 [18].

In the present study, we examined expression of MIA
in Nf1-deficient mouse cartilage, in human cutaneous
and plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs, and in sera
of NF1 patients with these tumours. MIA in the serum
of healthy probands was examined as a control.

Methods
Mouse breeding and tissue processing
The mice were continuously back-crossed to wild-type
C57BL/6J to minimize the variation of genetic back-
ground. The female Nf1flox mice were crossed to male
Nf1flox heterozygous Prx1-Cre-positive males and the off-
spring genotyped as previously described [9]. Embryos and
postnatal tissue samples were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4%
paraformaldehyde, dehydrated through an ethanol/xylol
series, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Six-micrometer
sections were cut and processed for haematoxylin and
eosin/Alcian blue staining and in situ hybridization.

Patients and samples
The study was conducted with a cohort of 42 NF1
patients and 22 healthy individuals. The diagnosis of NF1
was made using National Institutes of Health criteria.
The study protocol was approved by the local institu-
tional review board, and all patients gave their informed
consent. Cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours were
counted or estimated in case the number was larger than
100. Plexiform neurofibromas, including internal ones,
were detected by means of whole-body MRI in 30 of the
42 patients. Because of the limited resolution of whole-
body MRI, lesions smaller than 3 cm in the longest dia-
meter, which is often the case for spinal tumours, were

not included. Tumour sizes were calculated using a semi-
automated volumetric method, and the total internal
tumour load was obtained subsequently, including PNs
(Plexiform Neurofibromas), spinal tumours and internal
nodule neurofibromas, but excluding cutaneous and sub-
cutaneous tumours [19]. An age effect for cutaneous,
subcutaneous and internal tumours was examined using
a nonparametric Spearman’s rank-correlation test.

All serum samples were prepared using a standardized
protocol in the laboratory of the Department of Maxillo-
facial Surgery at the University Medical Center Ham-
burg-Eppendorf. Whole blood of each patient was kept at
room temperature for 30 minutes before being spun
down at 4,500 rpm for 10 minutes using a benchtop cen-
trifuge. The supernatant was stored at -80°C in 100-μL
aliquots.

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections
according to standard protocol [9]. Images were col-
lected using a DMR HC microscope (Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) equipped with an AxioCam HRc camera
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and evaluated using AxioVision
4.1 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Immunohistochemical detection of MIA
Sections of six cutaneous and three plexiform neurofibro-
mas, as well as seven MPNSTs, from a total of sixteen
NF1 patients were stained with monoclonal anti-human
MIA antibody (R&D Systems, McKinley Place NE, Min-
neapolis) diluted at 1:40. Sections were boiled in citrate
buffer (pH 6.1) for antigen retrieval. The streptavidin-bio-
tin method was performed using an automated staining
system TechMate (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) with an
implemented counterstaining. Negative controls were car-
ried out with normal serum without the primary antibody
or with antibody preincubated in access (25 ng/μl) of
recombinant human MIA (Peprotech GmbH, Hamburg,
Germany). Stained sections were analyzed using the BX51
microscope (Olimpus, Hamburg, Germany) and analySIS
5.0 software (Soft imaging system GmbH, Münster,
Germany).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
RNA was isolated from the knee cartilage of two wild-type
and two Nf1Prx1 mice using peqGOLD TriFast (PeqLab
Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) according to
the supplied protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of
total RNA with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix was then performed on an ABI PRISM 7900
Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR Green
method (Invitrogen, Darmstad, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The expression level of Mia

was determined in Nf1Prx1 and wild-type tissues and was
equilibrated against expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phos-
phate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The following primers
were used: mGAPDH: 5’ GGGAAGCCCATCACCAT
CTT 3’, 5’ CGGCCTCACCCCATTTG 3’; mMIA: 5’
GGAGGACCTGACTCTGAAACC 3’; 5’ ACTGCAGG-
GATAGCGGTAG 3’.

Mia elisa
The MIA ELISA kit was purchased from (Roche Diag-
nostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and the measurements
were conducted in duplicate according to the supplied
protocol. Internal negative and positive quality controls
were provided in each enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit and were run in triplicate in each
assay.

Results
Mia expression is elevated in Nf1-deficient murine
cartilage
In situ hybridization revealed expression of Mia in the
cartilage of the E14.5 to E15.5 mouse embryo (Figure 1).
Expression domains of Sox9, Col2a and Mia overlapped
and, in the E14.5 embryo sections, demarcated cartilage
anlagen of the future bones (Figure 1A). The expression
of Mia was found to be more intensive in the NF1-defi-
cient cartilage of the Nf1Prx1 mice (Figure 1B). Similar
results were obtained with mouse embryos bearing carti-
lage-specific inactivation of Nf1 (data not shown). We
next quantified Mia expression by performing quantita-
tive real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
Absolute quantification was conducted on the RNA iso-
lated from knee cartilage of two mutant and two control
mice at P4. Mia transcript levels in Nf1-deficient tissue

were compared to the wild-type tissue and normalized
to GAPDH expression. qRT-PCR revealed a more than
twofold increase of Mia expression in Nf1Prx1-deficient
cartilage.

MIA is expressed in NF1-associated tumours
MIA was immunohistochemically detected on the paraf-
fin sections of six cutaneous and three plexiform neuro-
fibromas and in seven MPNSTs from NF1 patients. The
typical pattern of MIA staining was a mixture of positive
and negative nuclei side-by-side (Figure 2). The propor-
tion of MIA-positive cells varied between 50% and 90%.
The most intense staining was obtained in MPNSTs,
which, however, represents the high density of nuclei in
this type of tumour. No morphological difference was
observed between MIA-positive and MIA-negative cells.
On the basis of the degenerative nuclear atypia of
Schwann cells, we deduced that MIA was both positive
and negative in Schwann cell nuclei. MIA-positive cells
were more often seen in areas of spindle-shaped cells
arranged in fascicles.

Serum concentration of MIA in NF1 patients correlates
with tumour load

MIA serum level was determined in the 42 NF1 patients
and in 22 healthy individuals. The patients’ ages ranged
from 14 to 72 years (mean age, 36 years). The control
group’s ages ranged between 19 and 67 years (mean age,
40 years). An age effect was seen in the NF1 patients for
the number of cutaneous tumours (P = 0.023), but not
for subcutaneous tumours (P = 0.842) or internal
tumours (P = 0.449). Additionally, linear regression ana-
lysis revealed an association between total internal

the total tumor load: 0 to 100 mL (n = 16), < 350 mL (n = 5), < 1,000 mL (n = 5) and > 1,000 mL (n = 4). Differences between groups were
evaluated using an unpaired t-test (A and B) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc t-test including the Bonferroni correction
(C to E). **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. The linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the logarithm of internal tumor load and
MIA serum concentration.

tumour load and the number of subcutaneous tumours
(P value 8.19E-17 for the F test), but not between internal
tumour load and the number of cutaneous tumours.

MIA serum concentration was independent of age and
sex (data not shown), but was significantly higher in NF1
patients than in healthy controls: 15.16 ± 1.26 pg/mL ver-
sus 4.54 ± 0.40 pg/mL (P < 0.001, unpaired t-test with
Welch’s correction) (Figure 3A). Among the 42 NF1
patients, the 27 patients with pNFs had significantly
higher MIA serum concentration than the 15 patients
without those tumours (P = 0.032) (Figure 3B). However,
no significant difference in MIA serum level was found
between the 7 and 35 patients with and without
MPNSTs, respectively (Figure 3B). MIA serum level was
also significantly higher in the nine and seven patients
with > 100 subcutaneous neurofibromas and > 1,000
cutaneous neurofibromas, respectively, than in those
without such tumours (Figures 3C and 3D). Internal
tumour load was determined for 30 of the 42 NF1
patients on the basis of whole-body MRI. The patients
were divided into four groups: very low internal tumour
loads (0 to 100 mL; n = 16), low internal tumour loads (<
350 mL; n = 5), moderate internal tumour loads (< 1,000
mL; n = 5) and high internal tumour loads (> 1,000 mL;
n = 4) (Figure 3E, left). One-way analysis of variance with
the Bonferroni multiple comparison test revealed signifi-
cant differences between MIA serum levels in patients
with very low internal tumour loads and groups with
high and very high internal tumour loads (**P < 0.01,
***P < 0.001). Also, linear regression analysis revealed an
association between the total internal tumour load and
MIA serum level (P value of 1.95E-7 for the F-test). The
line that best predicts MIA level from values of logarithm
of internal tumor load volume was identified by regres-
sion analysis: R2 = ~0.64 (Figure 3E, right). These data
indicate that elevated MIA serum level may be indicative
of an increased internal tumour burden. Since we
observed an association between total internal tumour
load and the number of subcutaneous tumours, a study
involving a larger cohort size is necessary to reveal the
relative contributions of internal, subcutaneous and pos-
sibly also cutaneous tumours to elevated MIA levels.

Discussion
In this study, we found increased Mia expression in Nf1-
deficient cartilage of Nf1Prx1 mice where SOX9 expres-
sion and nuclear localization were previously shown [9].
MIA promoter was previously shown to be regulated by
SOX9 in a dose-dependent manner in cultured chondro-
cytes [20]. It thus appears likely that MIA expression in
NF1 tumours is also regulated by SOX9, as this transcrip-
tion factor was reported to be required for the survival of
MPNST cells [11]. Our finding of MIA expression in var-
ious NF1-related tumours is consistent with the findings

of previous reports that MIA is expressed in glial
tumours [15].

The major finding of the present study is that MIA
serum levels correlate with the internal tumour load in
NF1 patients. Provided that this correlation can be con-
firmed in a larger cohort of NF1 patients, MIA would
be a valuable biomarker for the internal tumour load.

In malignant melanoma cells, MIA was shown to bind
integrin a5 and reduce ERK activity [17]. MIA/cad-
herin-7 interactions were shown to regulate cell-cell
adhesion of malignant melanoma cells, influencing their
migration [18]. It was also reported that MIA augmen-
ted transforming growth factor-b-mediated chondro-
genic differentiation of human mesenchymal cells in
vitro [21] and inhibited articular cartilage mineralization
in vivo [22]. It will be interesting to examine whether
any of these effects of MIA play a role in NF1-related
tumorigenesis and skeletal dysplasia. While more studies
are needed to understand the contribution of MIA to
NF1 pathology, the presented correlation of MIA serum
level with the internal tumour load suggests that it is a
promising candidate as a biomarker of the tumour load
in NF1.

Conclusions
MIA is a potential biomarker of tumour load in NF1
patients and should be further evaluated for application
in monitoring the clinical course and therapy outcomes
of patients.
