Meningiomas arise from the arachnoid layer of the meninges that surround the brain and spine.
They account for over one third of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults and confer
a signiﬁcant risk of location-dependent morbidity due to compression or displacement. A signif-
icant increase in risk of meningiomas is associated with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) disease
through mutation of the NF2 gene. In addition, approximately 5% of individuals with schwanno-
matosis disease develop meningiomas, through mutation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
complex subunit, SMARCB1. Recently, a second SWI/SNF complex subunit, SMARCE1, was
identiﬁed as a cause of clear cell meningiomas, indicating a wider role for this complex in menin-
gioma disease. The sonic hedgehog (SHH)-GLI1 signaling pathway gene, SUFU, has also been
identiﬁed as the cause of hereditary multiple meningiomas in a large Finnish family. The recent
identiﬁcation of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling
pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningi-
omas. This review describes the known meningioma predisposition genes and their links to the
recently identiﬁed somatic mutations.

Meningiomas are the most common primary central nervous
system tumors in adults (1). Over 90% of meningiomas are
single and sporadic. Fewer than 2% of meningiomas are
classed as malignant; however, 20e35% of meningiomas,
initially classed as benign, have been reclassiﬁed as atypical
since the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system
changed in 2007 (2). These tumors tend to occur at an earlier
age and have a seven-to eightfold increased rate of recur-
rence. Atypical meningiomas also confer a reduced survival
rate with an approximately twofold increased risk of death by
3e5 years after diagnosis (3).

Benign meningiomas carry a signiﬁcant risk of location-
dependent morbidity due to compression or displacement.
Spinal meningiomas can cause back pain and numbness
and weakness of the arms or legs, suprasellar and intra-
orbital meningiomas can cause vision problems and swelling
or bulging of the eye, and olfactory groove meningiomas can
cause loss of sense of smell. Intraventricular meningiomas
may cause headaches and changes in mental function due to
increased pressure resulting from reduced ﬂow of cerebro-
spinal ﬂuid, whereas meningiomas within the convexity can

cause various focal neurological deﬁcits that are restricted to
a speciﬁc region, such as weakness or paresthesia in one
side of the face, or one arm or leg.

Many meningiomas are well-delineated tumors that
respond well to surgical excision, although meningiomas that
occur in the skull base can be difﬁcult to access and remove.
Meningioma growth can be unpredictable. Some meningi-
omas show a linear growth pattern that may be fast or slow
and may be dependent on the level of calciﬁcation (4),
whereas others show a saltatory growth pattern with variable
periods of quiescence (5). There are many histologic
subtypes of meningioma. Meningothelial, ﬁbroblastic, and
transitional meningiomas, as well as the psammomatous,
secretory, microcystic, angiomatous,
lymphoplasmacyte-
rich, and metaplastic variants are all classed as grade I.
Clear cell, chordoid and atypical subtypes are classed as
grade II, whereas the anaplastic, rhabdoid, and papillary
variants are all classed as grade III. Most meningiomas have
a mixed histology and are categorized by the dominant
component.

Of the known causes for sporadic meningiomas, ionizing
radiation is probably the most common. A hormonal aspect
to meningioma development has also been suggested, as
there is a 2.3:1 overall female/male ratio for meningiomas
(6), and even higher ratios, of between 4:1 and 9:1, have
been reported for spinal meningiomas (7e10).

meningiomas that develop before 20 years of age (11,12)
and that the appearance of meningiomas in women can
correlate with, or worsen during, pregnancy (13,14). There is
no deﬁnitive evidence for
inﬂuence and
although the accelerated growth of meningiomas during
pregnancy has been attributed to raised progesterone levels
(15), the proportion of meningiomas expressing progester-
one receptors is not signiﬁcantly different between males and
females (16) and a recent study has shown that the effects of
pregnancy on meningioma growth may be more likely to be
due to temporary hemodynamic changes (14).

The most common genetic cause of meningiomas is
mutation of the NF2 gene. Germline mutations of NF2 cause
the tumor suppressor syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type 2
(NF2), which predisposes individuals to schwannomas and
ependymomas as well as meningiomas. Other individuals
without a family history of NF2 disease harbor multiple
meningiomas that are likely to be caused by an underlying
genetic cause. Cases with more than one meningioma, but
no other clinical features of NF2 or schwannomatosis, may
arise because of independent sporadic tumors (17), mosaic
NF2 with no mutation identiﬁed in the blood (18), or clonal
spread of a single sporadic tumor (19,20). The identiﬁcation
of different NF2 mutations in each tumor indicates that the
tumors arose independently. Identical, biallelic NF2 muta-
tions in each tumor indicates mosaic NF2 or clonal spread.
Identical somatic mutations in other genes or X-inactivation
of the same X chromosome (19) indicates clonal spread of
a single tumor. Rare families also exist with a history of
meningiomas, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion,
outside of the context of NF2 disease (13,21).

Two of

the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
subunits, SMARCB1 (22) and SMARCE1 (13), have been
implicated in meningioma disease. Germline mutations of
SMARCB1 confer a risk of meningiomas as part of
the
schwannomatosis phenotype. More recently, loss-of-function
mutations in SMARCE1 were found to speciﬁcally predis-
pose carriers to clear cell meningiomas (13,23).

repress genes throughout
the genome. Each complex includes one of the two ATPase
subunits, SMARCA2 or SMARCA4;
the evolutionarily
conserved core subunits, SMARCB1, SMARCC1, and
SMARCC2; and additional complex-speciﬁc variant subunits
(24) (Figure 1A and B). SMARCE1 is not conserved in lower
eukaryotes, but it has been found to exist in all mammalian
forms of
the complex (25). Several reports have found
associations between the SWI/SNF complex and various
forms of cancer (26). For example, somatic SMARCA4
mutations have been found in medulloblastomas of
the
wingless-related integration site (WNT) and sonic hedgehog
(SHH) subtypes (27).
In addition to SMARCE1, other
SWI/SNF subunits have recently been associated with clear
cell
tumors. Somatic ARID1A mutations are associated
with ovarian clear cell carcinomas (28), and somatic
PBRM1 mutations are associated with clear cell renal cell
carcinomas (29).

Mutations of SMARCB1 have been associated with
several forms of cancer (30). Germline SMARCB1 mutations
are known to cause the highly aggressive pediatric cancer
atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) (31), as well as the

benign tumor predisposition syndrome schwannomatosis
(32). The type of SMARCB1 mutation and its location
within the gene are signiﬁcantly different between these two
syndromes (33), indicating different mechanisms of tumor
development in different syndromes caused by the same
gene.

A nontruncating mutation in the Shh-Gli1 pathway gene,
SUFU, was identiﬁed as the cause of multiple meningiomas
in a single large Finnish family (21). SUFU, SMARCB1, and
SMARCE1 have all been associated with a predisposition to
meningiomas and are all known to bind the Shh pathway
transcription factor, Gli1 (34). Somatic mutations identiﬁed in
the Shh-Gli and Akt1-mTor signaling pathways in non-NF2-
associated meningiomas (35,36) indicate the potential for
cross talk of these pathways in the development of menin-
gioma tumors.

Genetic risk factors

NF2-associated meningiomas

NF2
Germline mutation of the NF2 gene is the most commonly
identiﬁed genetic risk factor for multiple meningioma disease.
Multiple meningiomas often occur as part of the NF2 tumor
suppressor syndrome. Germline NF2 mutations are detect-
able in over 90% of all cases of nonmosaic NF2 disease and
confer a signiﬁcant risk of meningiomas, with approximately
50% of people with NF2 developing at least one intracranial
meningioma during their lifetime. The presence of intracra-
nial meningiomas in NF2 is associated with the likelihood of
disease mortality.

The risk of meningiomas in NF2 disease has been
demonstrated to correlate with the type and location of
mutations within the gene, with a greater risk of developing
a meningioma associated with truncating mutations than

end of the gene than the 3

nontruncating mutations and with mutations occurring toward
the 5
end of the gene (11). It was
also noted that males are more likely than females to develop
meningiomas before 20 years of age, whereas females are
more likely than males to develop meningiomas over the age
of 20 years (11).

Somatic biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene can also
be found in almost two thirds of sporadic meningiomas.
Most meningiomas that occur
in NF2 disease have a
ﬁbroblastic or transitional histology. Differences in the fre-
quency of NF2 mutations identiﬁed in different subtypes of
meningiomas have been described, with mutations found in
70% and 83% of ﬁbroblastic and transitional meningiomas,
respectively, in comparison with only 25% of meningothelial
meningiomas (37).

Meningiomas occurring in NF2 disease are generally
considered to be more aggressive than sporadic meningi-
omas, because of an increased proliferation potential
(38,39); however, this difference could be due to a selection
bias toward the individuals who present for surgery (40).

Non-NF2-associated meningiomas

SMARCB1
Somatic SMARCB1 mutations have been identiﬁed in rare
cases of sporadic meningiomas (41), and more recently,
it has been suggested that schwannomatosis disease
may confer a slight increase in risk of meningiomas, with
approximately 5% of
individuals with schwannomatosis
developing one or more meningiomas (42). Rare schwan-
nomatosis families have also been described, with different
affected family members developing only schwannomas or
only meningiomas (22,43). SMARCB1-associated meningi-
omas appear to have a predilection for the falx cerebri (43).
In both schwannomatosis and NF2 disease, meningiomas
may be the presenting or sole manifestation of the disease.
NF2 and SMARCB1 are located 6 MB apart on chromosome
22, and somatic loss of most, or all, of the chromosome
22q arm during tumor development means that they are
frequently lost in combination.

Germline SMARCB1 mutations are known to cause both
schwannomatosis (32) and AT/RT (31,44), two conditions
with very different prognoses. The spectrum of mutations
differs between these conditions, with truncating mutations in
the central exons and large intragenic and whole gene
deletions being common in AT/RT, whereas nontruncating
mutations at the beginning and end of SMARCB1 and a

0
untranslated region mutation, c.*82C>T, are
recurrent 3
common in schwannomatosis (33,42). A schematic diagram
of SMARCB1 is shown in Figure 2A. Recently, germline
nontruncating mutations in exons 8 and 9 of SMARCB1 have
also been associated with CofﬁneSiris syndrome (45), a
developmental disorder with no known increased risk of tumor
development. A single case of CofﬁneSiris has been reported
with both CofﬁneSiris and multiple schwannomas (46).
Interestingly, one of the SMARCB1 mutations associated with
CofﬁneSiris, pArg377His, has also been reported as a
recurrent somatic mutation in four of 126 meningiomas (41). A
single frameshift mutation in the adjacent codon, which
removes the native stop codon and leads to an extended
transcript, was identiﬁed in a single meningioma in a screen of
an additional 80 meningiomas, although only exons 1, 4, 5,
and 9 were screened in this study (47). The screening of
germline DNA from a series of 45 individuals with non-NF2-
associated multiple meningiomas did not
identify any
SMARCB1 mutations (48). Together, these studies show that
SMARCB1 mutations are an occasional cause of meningioma
predisposition, and that they can occur somatically in spora-
dic meningiomas, and suggest that the timing and order in
which the mutations occur can alter the resulting phenotype.

SMARCE1
The occurrence of familial multiple meningiomas outside of
the context of NF2 disease is extremely rare. Recently,
germline loss-of-function mutations in the SMARCE1 chro-
matin remodeling factor were identiﬁed in three families
with multiple spinal clear cell meningiomas (13). Germline
SMARCE1 mutations have subsequently been identiﬁed in
cranial meningiomas, but they appear to be speciﬁc for the
clear cell histological subtype (23). Interestingly, somatic loss
of SMARCE1 was identiﬁed in a cranial clear cell meningi-
oma from a patient with a clinical diagnosis of NF2 disease
who had developed multiple schwannomas and meningi-
omas but who did not have an identiﬁed germline NF2
mutation. No germline SMARCE1 mutation was identiﬁed in
this patient. Meningiomas occurring in NF2 disease are
normally transitional or ﬁbroblastic, and clear cell tumors are
very rare. It is unclear whether the progression of these
tumors follows the same path as those due to germline
SMARCE1 mutations. Clear cell meningiomas are classiﬁed
as WHO grade II because of an apparent high recurrence
rate; however,
the risk of recurrence seen in the small
number of SMARCE1-related clear cell meningiomas re-
ported to date appears to be low.

Almost all

identiﬁed SMARCE1 mutations have been
truncating mutations, predicted to result in complete loss of
the protein product. However, they have also all occurred
between exons 5 and 9, which encompass the high molec-
ular weight group (HMG) domain and a conserved NHRLI
domain, indicating that these regions may be of particular
importance to the expression and/or structural
integrity of
the protein (Figure 2B). Indeed, the only pathogenic muta-
tions with the potential to produce an expressed protein
(c.237þ2C>T and c.374_395inv22) both disrupt the HMG
domain. No case of meningiomas associated with a germline
SMARCE1 mutation has so far been identiﬁed with any
clinical feature of CofﬁneSiris syndrome, although a single
SMARCE1 mutation found in a CofﬁneSiris patient (36) was
a nontruncating mutation, a mutation predicted to result in
expression of a hypomorphic protein rather than complete
loss of protein.

Both SMARCB1 and SMARCE1 have DNA-binding
properties, but neither

properties of the SWI/SNF complex as a whole. The extent
of their roles in gene regulation and the mechanism by which
they are involved in meningioma development require further
investigation.

SUFU
A SUFU missense mutation, c.367C>T (p.Arg123Cys), has
been associated with inherited multiple meningioma disease
in a single large family with ﬁve affected siblings (21). Wider
screening for germline mutations in 121 individuals did not
identify any further mutations, indicating that SUFU mutation
is an infrequent cause of meningioma.

Occasionally, meningiomas are seen in Gorlin syndrome
(also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
(NBCCS)), which is caused by mutations in PTCH1, which is
also part of the Shh signaling pathway. Recently, three fam-
ilies with classic Gorlin syndrome associated with childhood
medulloblastoma were shown to harbor germline SUFU mu-
tations (49). Two of the 10 affected family members within
those three families also developed meningiomas, although
both of these patients had undergone radiation therapy for
childhood medulloblastoma. It is uncertain how much of their
risk of meningioma was due to a genetic predisposition and
how much was due to the secondary effects of radiation
treatment. Although meningiomas are a known risk of radio-
therapy, there is evidence that pre-existing genetic mutations
in Shh pathway genes increase this risk further (50e52). In the
large Finnish SUFU family with multiple meningiomas, one
family member developed a childhood medulloblastoma and
another developed a basal cell carcinoma; however, it ap-
pears that these family members did not carry the SUFU
mutation. The level of risk of meningiomas caused by SUFU
mutations remains unclear. Table 1 lists the genes described
in this article as meningioma predisposition genes and the
genes known to be mutated somatically in tumors.

associated with meningioma development. In grade II me-
ningiomas, chromosomal losses have been identiﬁed on 1p,
22q, 14q, 18q, 10, and 6q, with gains identiﬁed on 20q, 12q,
15q, 1q, 9q, and 17q, whereas in grade III meningiomas,
additional
losses have been identiﬁed on 6q, 10, and 14q
(53,54).

Speciﬁc genes associated with meningioma progression
are still being discovered; however, the mutation of phos-
phatase and tensin homologue (PTEN ) on chromosome 10
(55,56) and CDKN2A (p14ARF) and CDKN2B on chromo-
some 9 (57) have been found to correlate with malignant
progression.

EPB41L3
Downregulation of EPB41L3 (also known as DAL-1)
expression and corresponding loss of the EPB41L3 protein
have been detected in meningiomas; EPB41L3 is often lost
in conjunction with the NF2 protein product, merlin (58). This
relationship appears to be speciﬁc to meningiomas, as the
same is not seen in schwannomas (58). Germline EPB41L3
mutations have not been identiﬁed in tumors showing protein
loss, although small somatic deletions in the EPB41L3 region
have been detected by SNP analysis (59). In addition, an
EPB41L3 knockout mouse model showed no differences in
cell proliferation or growth characteristics and showed no
increased risk of cancer (60). These studies indicate that
EPB41L3 loss is not an initiating event in meningioma growth
but that it occurs as a secondary effect during tumor devel-
opment in NF2-associated meningiomas.

SHH-GLI pathway mutations

Two large studies investigating somatic mutations in
meningiomas identiﬁed several mutations in non-NF2 me-
ningiomas in the G-protein-coupled receptor, Smoothened
(SMO), and a recurrent mutation in the MTOR path-
wayeassociated serine-threonine protein kinase V-AKT
murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1)
(35,36). Additionally, mutations in two further genes, the E3
ubiquitin protein ligase, TNF receptoreassociated factor 7
(TRAF7) and the Kr€uppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) were identiﬁed
in one study (35). Somatic mutations in KLF4 and SMO were

found to occur mutually exclusively of meningiomas with NF2
involvement. TRAF7 was frequently co-mutated with AKT1
or KLF4, whereas AKT1 and KLF4 mutations were mutually
exclusive of each other.

Mutations in all of these genes appear to segregate with
differences in histological subtype and tumor
location.
Meningiomas that occur due to germline NF2 mutations tend
to be transitional, ﬁbroblastic, or meningothelial and to be
located within the lateral and posterior skull base, whereas
non-NF2 meningiomas are more medially located. Meningi-
omas occurring in association with schwannomatosis dis-
ease, which is caused by germline SMARCB1 mutations, are
predominantly found in the falx cerebri
(43). Germline
SMARCE1 mutations cause clear cell meningiomas that may
be located in the brain or spine. Somatic mutations in SMO
were found in meningiomas of the medial anterior skull base.
Meningiomas harboring somatic mutations in either SMO or
AKT1 are more likely to have meningothelial histology,
whereas meningiomas harboring TRAF7 or KLF4 mutations
are more likely to have a secretory component. The reasons
for the speciﬁc involvement of different genes in each his-
tological subtype are unclear, but they may become clearer
as further genetic determinants and their connecting path-
ways are investigated.

SHH ligand activates this signaling cascade by binding to the
transmembrane receptor, PTCH1, causing PTCH1 to release
its inhibition of the G-protein-coupled receptor SMO. SMO is
then free to dissociate from the cell membrane and promote
activation and nuclear translocation of the glioma-associated
oncogene transcription factors GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3. A
diagram of the SHH pathway is shown in Figure 3. GLI1 and
GLI2 are transcriptional activators of downstream genetic
targets, whereas GLI3 represses transcription. SUFU acts
to regulate GLI1-mediated transcriptional activation (61).
SUFU, SMARCB1, and SMARCE1 have all been implicated
in a predisposition to meningioma disease (13,21,62) and
have all been found to interact with GLI1 (34).

Regions of the GLI1 N-terminus are involved in recruit-
ment of histone deacetylase complexes, via SUFU, which
are involved in DNA folding within chromosomes. The roles
of SMARCB1 and SMARCE1 in this pathway are unclear,
although the SWI/SNF complex is known to activate or
repress many genes throughout the genome. Differing pro-
tein binding properties of these components suggest a role in
targeting the complex for activation or repression of speciﬁc
genes. Both SMARCB1 and SMARCE1 have DNA binding
capabilities (25,63); however, neither is essential for the DNA
binding properties of the SWI/SNF complex as a whole.

Shh-Gli1 pathway
The Shh signaling pathway is known to be involved in cell
fate determination, proliferation, and patterning in many cell
types and in most organs during embryo development. The

Shh pathway interactions
Somatic mutations identiﬁed in SMO and AKT1 in meningi-

downstream targets through increased activation and trans-
location of
Indeed, one of
the SMO mutations identiﬁed in meningiomas has been
seen previously as a somatic mutation in basal cell carci-
nomas (64). AKT1 activates the SHH pathway through
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation, as
phosphorylated AKT1 antagonizes protein kinase A (PKA)e
dependent
inactivation of GLI (65). The recurrent AKT1
mutation p.Glu17Lys has been detected previously in breast
cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer (66). This
mutation activates PI3-kinase-dependent signaling through
aberrant localization of AKT1 to the cell membrane (66).
Cross talk between the AKT1-MTOR and SHH-GLI1 path-
ways has also been described in other cancers, including
gastric cancers (67,68). SHH signaling was shown to activate
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)eAKT1 pathway that
promotes epithelial-mesenchyme transition and metastasis
of gastric cancer (67).

The SHH-GLI pathway may also be affected in meningi-
omas resulting from an NF2 mutation, since wild-type merlin
interacts with the brain speciﬁc variants of the PI3K enhancer
(PIKE), resulting in inhibition of PI3K (69). AKT-dependent
phosphorylation of merlin results in loss of merlin binding to
PIKE and causes degradation of merlin through ubiquitina-
tion (70).

KLF4 is a transcription factor (71,72) that plays a role in
proliferation, differentiation, and the induction of a pluripotent
stem cell state. KLF4 inhibits cell proliferation via the platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)emediated PI3K
pathway (73).
In addition to the mutations identiﬁed in
meningiomas, KLF4 has been shown to act as a tumor
suppressor in medulloblastoma (74) and glioblastoma (75)
tumors; however, depending on cellular conditions, KLF4
has been found to act as both a tumor suppressor and an
oncogene (76). An oncogenic role has been identiﬁed in
squamous cell carcinoma (77) and in leukemias and lym-
phomas (78).

Somatic mutations in tumor necrosis factor

recep-
toreassociated factor 7 (TRAF7) were found in 72 of 300
meningiomas screened in one large study, and over 90% of
these mutations were located in the C-terminal WD40
domains (35). TRAF7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the
TNF and NF-kB signaling pathways (79,80). It also induces
caspase-dependent apoptosis via its RING ﬁnger domain
(79). It has no known role in the SHH-GLI signaling pathway,
but it is known to bind to MEKK3 through its WD40 domains,
leading to activation of the JNK and p38 MAP kinases (79).
These functions would be disrupted by the mutations iden-
tiﬁed in meningiomas.

Conclusion

Meningiomas are a diverse group of tumors with varied his-
tology and growth patterns. The heterogeneity in germline
and somatic mutations indicates a complex network of
pathway interactions involving the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-
MTOR signaling pathways, which require further investiga-
tion. Further studies are also needed to understand the role
of chromatin remodeling factors in these pathways and how
the meningioma-associated mutations lead to tumor forma-
tion. Categorization by of meningiomas by histology,

location, and genetic mutation, and a better understanding of
the mechanisms of meningioma development, will help in the
reﬁnement of stratiﬁed therapies and treatment plans.
