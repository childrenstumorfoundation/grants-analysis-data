TAM family receptor tyrosine kinases comprising Tyro3 (Sky), Axl, and Mer are overexpressed in some cancers, correlate with
multidrug resistance and contribute to tumourigenesis by regulating invasion, angiogenesis, cell survival and tumour growth.
Mutations in the gene coding for a tumour suppressor merlin cause development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such
as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neuroﬁbromatosis
type 2. The benign character of merlin-deﬁcient tumours makes them less responsive to chemotherapy. We previously showed that,
amongst other growth factor receptors, TAM family receptors (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) are signiﬁcantly overexpressed in schwannoma
tissues. As Axl is negatively regulated by merlin and positively regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, previously shown to be
a key regulator in schwannoma growth we hypothesized that Axl is a good target to study in merlin-deﬁcient tumours. Moreover,
Axl positively regulates the oncogene Yes-associated protein, which is known to be under merlin regulation in schwannoma and is
involved in increased proliferation of merlin-deﬁcient meningioma and mesothelioma. Here, we demonstrated strong
overexpression and activation of Axl receptor as well as its ligand Gas6 in human schwannoma primary cells compared to normal
Schwann cells. We show that Gas6 is mitogenic and increases schwannoma cell-matrix adhesion and survival acting via Axl in
schwannoma cells. Stimulation of the Gas6/Axl signalling pathway recruits Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and NFkB. We showed
that NFkB mediates Gas6/Axl-mediated overexpression of survivin, cyclin D1 and FAK, leading to enhanced survival, cell-matrix
adhesion and proliferation of schwannoma. We conclude that Axl/FAK/Src/NFkB pathway is relevant in merlin-deﬁcient tumours
and is a potential therapeutic target for schwannoma and other merlin-deﬁcient tumours.

receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation.1–4 TAM family

Axl/Gas6/NFkB signalling in human schwannoma
S Ammoun et al

Using our schwannoma in vitro model, we demonstrate strong
overexpression of all three members of the TAM receptor family,
and their ligand Gas6 in human schwannoma. We show that Gas6
is mitogenic and increases schwannoma cell-matrix adhesion and
survival acting via Axl in schwannoma cells. Furthermore, Gas6
signalling via speciﬁcally Axl involves focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
and Src, but not the ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and AKT signalling pathways.
We also demonstrate the role of NFkB, which regulates Gas6/Axl-
mediated overexpression of survivin, cyclin D1 and FAK leading to
enhanced survival, cell-matrix adhesion and proliferation of
schwannoma. NFkB expression was
found to be merlin-
dependent and its activity depended on Axl.

RESULTS
Axl, Tyro3 and Mer receptors are overexpressed in schwannoma
TAM family receptors, Axl, Tyro3 and Mer are expressed at higher
levels in human primary schwannoma compared with normal
Schwann cells (Figures 1a, c, and e). The expression of Axl and
Tyro3 but not Mer was decreased by the reintroduction of merlin
(Figures 1b, d and f). Thus Axl and Tyro3 but not Mer are under
direct merlin control.

Gas6 is expressed and released from both schwannoma and
Schwann cells
The TAM receptor ligand, Gas6, was also expressed at higher levels
in schwannoma than in Schwann cells (Figure 1g). Furthermore,
Gas6 was also released from both cell types, with slightly higher
levels (not signiﬁcant) being observed from schwannoma cells as
compared with Schwann cells (Figure 1h). Moreover, Gas6
expression was decreased upon reintroduction of merlin, suggest-
ing that this TAM ligand is regulated by merlin (Figure 1i).

Gas6 increases schwannoma proliferation, cell-matrix adhesion
and survival and activates Axl receptor
Proliferation. Gas6-containing medium (40 ng/ml, 24 h) increased
proliferation of schwannoma cells by B80% with the same
efﬁciency as 10% FCS, while mock had no effect (Figure 2a). The
speciﬁcity of Gas6-mediated proliferation was conﬁrmed using
recombinant human Axl and Tyro3 ectodomain-Fc chimeras to
capture Gas6 from media (Figure 2b), and the chimeras’
speciﬁcities were conﬁrmed by using Insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-I),
to which they did not bind (Figure 2c). Axl shRNA
completely inhibited the Gas6-mediated increase in proliferation
of schwannoma cells (Figure 2d). Moreover, Gas6 increased the
phosphorylation/activity of Axl (Figure 2e). Thus, Gas6-mediated
proliferation of schwannoma cells is mediated via the Axl receptor.

Adhesion.
Similarly to the increased proliferation, Gas6 (40 ng/ml)
potentiated schwannoma cell-matrix adhesion by 40% (Figure 2f),
while medium had no effect (Figure 2f). Axl shRNA completely
inhibited the Gas6-mediated increased cell-matrix adhesion
(Figure 2g). Thus, Gas6-mediated adhesion occurs via the Axl
receptor. Controls for the speciﬁcity of Axl shRNA are shown in
Figure 2h, where only Axl downregulation but not Tyro3 or Mer
were observed (Figure 2h).

Schwannoma cells cultured,

Survival.
in DMEM without any
supplements, for 5 days displayed only 6% of cell death, which
was rescued by Gas6 40 ng/ml to B2% (n¼ 5) (Figure 2i). The data
suggest that schwannoma cells develop pro-survival mechanisms
during starvation, which conﬁrms our previous ﬁndings,22 and that
Gas6 seem to have a role in the increase of cell viability.

Tissue expression. As Gas6-mediated proliferation and cell-matrix
adhesion are fully dependent on Axl receptor, we went on to
explore Axl-mediated signalling in schwannoma. Firstly, by

immunohistochemistry, we were able to show strong staining
for both Axl (Figure 2j) and phospho-Axl (Figure 2k), in human
schwannoma tissues compared with normal nerves, with both
cytoplasmic and widespread nuclear immunoreactivity in the
tumour cells. Next, we dissected potential downstream signalling
pathways from Axl in human schwannoma primary cells.

Signalling pathways activated by Gas6 via Axl in schwannoma
Gas6 leads to the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, AKT, FAK and Src in
schwannoma cells.
Stimulation of schwannoma cells with Gas6
(40 ng/ml) for 5 min lead to strong activation/phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, JNK and AKT (Figures 3a, b and c), which have previously
been shown to contribute to increased proliferation, cell-matrix
adhesion and survival in schwannoma.10,11,23–27 FAK, which has been
previously shown to be overexpressed and strongly activated in
schwannoma, contributing to increased proliferation and cell-matrix
adhesion,10,12 is also activated/phosphorylated by Gas6 at autophos-
phorylation site Y397 and Src phosphorylation site Y925 (Figures 3d
and e). Levels of active/phosphorylated Src P-Y416, previously demon-
strated to have an important role in schwannoma development by
increasing proliferation,12 were also increased by Gas6 (Figure 3f).

Dissection of Gas6-mediated pathways towards activation of ERK1/2,
JNK and AKT in schwannoma cells. Using various inhibitors
SU6656 (Src), FTI-277 (Ras), Wortmannin (PI3K), GF109203x (PKC),
previously validated in our cells,10,12,25 we found that Gas6
stimulated ERK and JNK,
recruiting Src and PI3K but not
involving Ras and PKC (Figures 3g and h). Gas6-mediated AKT
activation proceeded via Src and PI3K but not via Ras and PKC
(Figure 3i). Thus the ERK, JNK and AKT pathways share similar
mediators such as Src and PI3K.

Axl triggers Gas6-mediated activation of Src and FAK but not ERK,
JNK or AKT. As Gas6 is an agonist for all TAM family receptors and
Gas6-induced proliferation, and cell-matrix adhesion can be
blocked by Axl knockdown, we used Axl shRNA to monitor which
signalling pathways are triggered by this particular receptor. We
demonstrate that Axl shRNA decreased Gas6-mediated Src and
FAK (Figures 4d–f) but not ERK1/2, JNK or AKT activity (Figures 4a–c).
These data therefore suggests that Gas6-mediated activation of
ERK1/2, JNK and AKT (as shown in Figures 3a–c) probably proceeds
via other TAM family receptors overexpressed in schwannoma such
as Tyro3 and Mer.

NFkB is upregulated in schwannoma
We observed that Axl receptor activation leads to downstream
activation of Src and FAK, but not of ERK1/2, JNK or AKT upon
stimulation with Gas6. However, Axl activation by Gas6 does
increase schwannoma proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion. We
therefore hypothesized that an additional pathway must be
involved in Gas6/Axl-mediated signalling towards
increased
proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion. The transcription factor
NFkB acts downstream of Axl
lines and its activity is
regulated by Gas6.28 Moreover, NFkB regulates expression of
FAK,29 which localizes to the nucleus in schwannoma cells leading
to increased proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion.12 NFkB is
known to be an anti-apoptotic factor in Schwann cells.30 We
therefore investigated the expression and signalling of NFkB in
human schwannoma downstream of Axl.

in cell

We demonstrate that NFkB (p65 subunit)

is strongly over-
expressed in schwannoma cells (Figure 5a) owing to merlin deﬁ-
ciency as merlin reintroduction into primary human schwannoma
cells decreased NFkB (p65) expression (Figure 4b). Immunocyto-
chemistry showed nuclear localization of NFkB in both Schwann
and schwannoma cells (Figure 5c) as expected. The levels of
phosphorylated NFkB (P-Ser529), which increases NFkB transcrip-
tional activity was also elevated in schwannoma cells (Figure 5d).

lated/active (Gas6 40 ng/ml, 5 min) NFkB (p65 subunit) (Figure 5h).

The expression of survivin, cyclin D1 and FAK are potentiated by Gas6
in a NFkB-mediated manner in schwannoma cells. As both Gas6
and NFkB are known to regulate the survival and proliferation of
Schwann cells30 and are linked to cyclin D1 and FAK expression,
which are relevant for tumour development,29,31 we investigated
the role of the Gas6/NFkB signalling axis in the expression of
survivin, cyclin D1, and FAK.

Cyclin D1. Gas6 (40 ng/ml, 24 h) potentiated the expression of
cyclin D1 (Figure 6e), which is overexpressed in schwannoma
cells32 in a merlin-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 2B).
NFkB acted as a mediator in the potentiation of cyclin D1
expression (Figures 6f and g). These data therefore suggest that
the Gas6/Axl/NFkB signalling axis may have a role the pathological
proliferation of schwannoma cells.

Survivin.
Survivin was overexpressed in primary human schwan-
noma cells (Figure 6a). Gas6 (40 ng/ml, 24 h) potentiated the
expression of survivin (Figure 6b) in a merlin-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 2A).11 NFkB was found to be involved in
this process as both the NFkB inhibitor SN50 and NFkB shRNA
(Supplementary Figure 1)
signiﬁcantly inhibited the Gas6-
mediated expression of survivin (Figures 6c and d). These data
suggest that the Gas6/Axl/NFkB signalling axis may have a role in
the pathological survival of schwannoma cells.

The expression of FAK was increased by Gas6 (40 ng/ml,
FAK.
24 h)
(Figure 6h). Reintroduction of merlin decreased FAK
expression (Supplementary Figure 2C). The inhibition of NFkB by
SN50 and NFkB shRNA (Supplementary Figure 1) decreased the
Gas6-mediated increase of FAK expression (Figures 6i and j). These
data therefore suggest that the Gas6/Axl/NFkB signalling axis
regulates the expression of FAK in schwannoma. Furthermore, we
also show in Figures 3d and e and Figures 4e and f that FAK
activity is potentiated by Gas6/Axl signalling.

The ERK1/2 (n¼ 7) (g) and the JNK (n¼ 7) (h) pathways follow similar route recruiting PI3K and Src and by passing Ras and PKC. The AKT pathway

cells were pre-treated with different inhibitors SU6656 (Src, 1h), FTI277 (Ras, 24 h), wortmannin (PI3K 1 h) and GF109203x (PKC, 1 h). The results in

samples from different patients (*Po0.05, **Po0.01). RhoGDI is used as a loading control as previously described in Hanemann et al.52

Gas6/Axl-mediated proliferation of schwannoma cells depends
on NFkB
We observed that NFkB is downstream of Axl regulating the expression
of cell cycle protein cyclin D1 and also FAK in human schwannoma.
Previously we have shown that FAK localizes to the nucleus and,
is responsible for integrin b1/IGFBP-1-mediated
together with Src,
proliferation independently of ERK1/2 and JNK.12 We therefore
investigated here the role of NFkB in Gas6/Axl-mediated proliferation.
Both the NFkB inhibitor SN50 and shRNA for NFkB (p65 subunit)
(Supplementary Figure 1) signiﬁcantly decreased Gas6-mediated
proliferation of schwannoma cells to basal levels (Figures 7a left
panel and b) in parallel to preventing Gas6-induced increases in
cyclin D1 (Figures 6f and g) and FAK (Figures 6i and j) expression.
Schwannoma cell viability upon SN50 treatment for 24 h was not
affected (Figure 7a right panel).

The role of NFkB in Gas6/Axl-mediated cell proliferation,
cell-matrix adhesion and survival in schwannoma cells
NFkB is speciﬁcally involved in Gas6/Axl-mediated proliferation in
schwannoma, which converges with integrin b1 signalling.
To test

whether NFkB is speciﬁc for Gas6-mediated proliferation, we also
investigated its role in PDGF-DD-, IGF-I- and b-heregulin-mediated
proliferation, all known to be relevant for schwannoma pathol-
ogy.10,11,26 We observed that NFkB is speciﬁc or selective for Gas6
signalling towards schwannoma proliferation, as SN50 had no
effect on either PDGF-DD or IGF-I and b-heregulin-mediated
proliferation (Figure 7c). Signalling triggered by IGFBP-1, acting via
integrin b1, also utilized NFkB for proliferation (Figure 7c).
Moreover, both IGFBP-1 (100 ng/ml) and Gas6 (40 ng/ml)
increased the expression of NFkB after 24 h of stimulation
(Figure 7d). These data suggest a degree of convergence between
Gas6/Axl and integrin b1/IGFBP-1 pathways towards increased
proliferation of schwannoma cells via NFkB.

schwannoma cells is difﬁcult as these cells survive, when cultured
under growth factor withdrawal conditions, for weeks displaying
only very minor decrease in cell viability in contrast to Schwann
cells as shown in Figures 2i and 7g and previously published in
Utermark et al.22

DISCUSSION
In this manuscript, we have investigated the role of Axl receptor
signalling in the development of merlin-deﬁcient schwannoma.
We formulated our hypothesis that Axl may contribute to
schwannoma development on the basis of previous ﬁndings: (1)
positive regulation of Axl by E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, which
we and others have shown to contribute to schwannoma tumour
growth;19 (2) Axl interaction with oncogene Yes-associated protein,
a member of Hippo pathway, which is under merlin regulation in
schwannoma and is involved in increased proliferation of merlin-
negative meningioma and mesothelioma;20 (3) negative regulation
of Axl by merlin; (4) the previously reported mitogenic effect of
Gas6 on human Schwann cells acting via Axl.21

Our results demonstrate strong overexpression of TAM family
receptors in human primary schwannoma cells compared with
normal Schwann cells, supporting previous array data.11 Strong
immunostaining of Axl and active/phospho-Axl was also observed
in schwannoma biopsies, within both tumour nuclei and the
cytoplasm, compared with normal nerve tissues. Overexpression
of Axl and Tyro3 is merlin-dependent
in human primary
schwannoma cells, which supports with previous data.19
Interestingly, the overexpression of Mer was not dependent on
merlin, suggesting a possibility of the involvement of additional
merlin-independent mechanisms/mutations. Merlin-dependent
overexpression of the TAM receptors agonist Gas6 was also
observed in schwannoma cell cultures. Gas6 is released from both
normal Schwann and schwannoma cells with slightly higher but
nonsigniﬁcant levels in schwannoma, suggesting the possibility
for autocrine or paracrine signalling. The impact of the TAM
receptor/Gas6 signalling axis on tumourigenesis and schwannoma

pathobiology was ascertained by functional assays, which
demonstrated strong mitogenic and pro-adhesive effects of
Gas6 on primary human schwannoma cells. Gas6 stimulation
increased both proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion and had a
pro-survival effect on schwannoma cells acting via the Axl
receptor, which was previously observed in human Schwann
cells21 and other tumours.33 Even though Gas6, known to be an
agonist for Axl, Tyro3 and Mer, activates ERK1/2, JNK, AKT, FAK and
Src in schwannoma, Gas6/Axl
receptor-dependent signalling
employed only FAK and Src. We thus suggest the presence of
signalling speciﬁcity among TAM family receptors in schwannoma.
As Axl mediates both increased proliferation and cell-matrix
adhesion, but does not stimulate activation of pro-proliferative
ERK1/2 and JNK and cell-matrix adhesion-stimulating ERK1/2,10 we
hypothesized that some other pathway must be involved in Axl-
mediated proliferation, cell-matrix adhesion and survival. NFkB
seemed to be a good candidate as it acts downstream of Axl in
lines,28 regulates expression of FAK which localizes to the
cell
nucleus in schwannoma cells leading to increased proliferation
and cell-matrix adhesion,12,29 its activity is positively regulated by
Gas6 in NIH 3T3 (mouse ﬁbroblast cells)28 and negatively
regulated by merlin in cell
in mouse
Schwann cells,30 mitogenic via cyclin D1 and is overexpressed and
constitutively active in tumours.35 Here, we demonstrate a strong
overexpression of NFkB in schwannoma cells, which is merlin
dependent. These data are supported by previous studies by Kim
et al.,36 showing that in NIH3T3 and C6 (rat astroglioma cells) cells,
NFkB expression is also merlin-dependent. In addition, we found
that transcriptional activity of NFkB was highly increased in
schwannoma as shown by western blotting and reporter gene
assays, and which was both Gas6- and Axl-dependent, suggesting
NFkB as an important signalling molecule downstream of Gas6/
Axl in schwannoma. The importance of NFkB in schwannoma is
its involvement in increased

expression of pro-survival protein survivin,11

overexpressed in schwannoma due to Gas6 stimulation.

addition, NFkB was found to be recruited in the Gas6-mediated

localization to the nucleus and focal adhesions increases the
proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion of schwannoma cells upon
IGFBP1-mediated integrin b1 activation independently of ERK1/2
and JNK.12 Here we revealed that FAK activity is potentiated by
Gas6, which is mediated by Axl receptor (5-minutes stimulation).
FAK expression is also strongly potentiated by Gas6 but mediated
by NFkB (24 h of stimulation). NFkB is involved in the increased
schwannoma proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion, sharing the

In conclusion, we have shown,

in this manuscript, that all
members of TAM family, Axl, Tyro3 and Mer, are overexpressed in
schwannoma. However, Axl do not act via ERK1/2, JNK or AKT in
our model employing Src/FAK and NFkB instead. We have
therefore in this paper focused on Axl as its signalling seemed
to be unorthodox and matching our previous ﬁndings in
schwannoma, which we could not fully explain before. In order
to develop the most effective therapy, all receptors and signalling

I

or

pathways should be investigated and tested, before decision on
what to take forward into clinical trials.

On the basis of present and previous results, we suggest Axl
and members of its downstream signalling cascade,
including
NFkB and Src, as potential therapeutic targets. Axl has previously
been suggested as a biomarker
for NF1-related tumours
(Johansson et al. (2012), unpublished data) and here we also put
forward Axl as a new candidate biomarker for spontaneous and
NF-2-related schwannomas.
Interestingly, soluble forms of TAM
receptors have been detected in human plasma,38,39 and
therefore could be easily detected in patients for diagnostic
purposes. In terms of therapeutics, there are different approaches
to inhibit the Axl receptor and its signalling,
including small-
molecule inhibitors such as MP470, a novel c-Kit/AXL kinase
inhibitor40 or
treatment with soluble Axl ectodomains that
neutralize Gas6.38 One of the new Axl inhibitors is already tested
in clinical
(2012),
unpublished data), and thus could be re-proﬁled and tested,
alone or in combination with other inhibitors, in schwannoma and
other merlin-deﬁcient tumours.

Figure 6. The role of NFkB in increased expression of Src, cyclin D1 and FAK in schwannoma. Pro-survival protein survivin is overexpressed in
schwannoma (NF2  /  ) (n¼ 4) (a). Survivin (n¼ 3) (b), cyclin D1 (n¼ 10) (e) and FAK (n¼ 6) (h) expression is potentiated by Gas6 upon 24-h
stimulation. Gas6-mediated increase in the expression of survivin (c (n¼ 3), d (n¼ 3)), cyclin D1 (f (n¼ 6), g (n¼ 3)) and FAK (i (n¼ 6), j (n¼ 4))
are dependent on NFkB. In (a) the data are normalized to normal Schwann cells (NF2þ /þ ), in c, f and i to the basal (nonstimulated) cells, in d,
g and j to basal mock-infected cells. In b, c, e, f, h and i statistical comparisons were made between nonstimulated (basal, white bars) and
stimulated (Gas6, grey bars). Both NFkB inhibitor SN50 (c, f and i) and shRNA (d, g and j) were used to inhibit NFkB-mediated signalling.

the cells were stimulated for 5 min as we previously showed that,

protein expression were performed upon 24-h post-stimulation.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described in
Ammoun et al.12,53 The sections were pre-treated with EDTA buffer at
pH 9 microwave for 10–30 min, before overnight incubation with the
primary antibodies at dilutions 1:75 (Axl) and 1:100 (pAxl). Detection was
performed with the Vectastain Universal Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK). Controls were by omission of the primary antibody.
Anti-Axl was from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan) and anti-phospho Axl from R&D
Systems. Tissue from ﬁve schwannomas and ﬁve controls (normal and
reactive nerve) were used.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM alone, DMEM containing 40 ng/ml
Gas6 (from conditioned medium collected form Gas6 producing HEK293
cells) or mock (from conditioned medium collected from equivalent, non-
Gas6-producing HEK293)54 or growth factor medium, as described in

Gas6) for 3 h. Inhibitors were added 40 min before stimulation.

Luciferase reporter assay
The cells were seeded onto 96-well pre-coated plates.14 The day after the
cells were infected with ready-to-transduce lentiviral particles expressing
either an inducible transcription factor-responsive reporter gene (ﬁreﬂy
luciferase) or expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase without any additional
transcriptional
response elements (negative control) or constitutively
expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase (positive control), as described by the
manufacturer (SABiosciences Corporation, Quiagen company; MD, USA).
On day 3, medium containing Cignal lentiviral particles was replaced with
fresh GFM (growth factor medium) culture medium. Day 4, medium was
changed to serum-free DMEM alone or containing 40 ng/ml Gas-6.
Detection was performed using Fireﬂy
Luciferase Assay System
(Promega), as described by the manufacturer.

Data analysis
