Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome
is caused by germline mutations in the NF1
tumor suppressor, which encodes neuroﬁ-
bromin, a GTPase activating protein for Ras.
Children with NF1 are predisposed to juve-
nile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and
lethally irradiated mice given transplants
with homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1ⴚ/ⴚ) hema-
topoietic stem cells develop a fatal myelopro-
liferative disorder (MPD) that models JMML.
We investigated the requirement for signal-

ing through the GM-CSF receptor to initiate
and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1
mutant hematopoietic cells lacking the com-
mon ␤ chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF recep-
tor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1ⴚ/ⴚ, beta cⴚ/ⴚ
stem cells did not develop evidence of MPD
despite the presence of increased number
of immature hematopoietic progenitors in
the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the
Mx1-Cre transgene was used to inactivate a
conditional Nf1 mutant allele in hematopoi-

etic cells, concomitant loss of beta cⴚ/ⴚ
reduced the severity of the MPD, but did not
abrogate it. Whereas inhibiting GM-CSF sig-
naling may be of therapeutic beneﬁt in
JMML, our data also demonstrate aberrant
proliferation of Nf1ⴚ/ⴚ myeloid progenitors
that is independent of signaling through the
GM-CSF receptor.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common familial cancer
syndrome that is associated with increased risk of speciﬁc neo-
plasms.1 Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomono-
cytic leukemia (JMML), a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD)
characterized by leukocytosis, organomegaly with myeloid inﬁltra-
tion, hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors to granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and a poor
prognosis.2,3 NF1 encodes neuroﬁbromin, a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) that accelerates the hydrolysis of active GTP-bound
Ras to inactive Ras-GDP.4,5 NF1-associated tumors frequently
demonstrate somatic loss of the normal NF1 allele, and extensive
data support the idea that NF1 functions as a tumor suppressor by
negatively regulating Ras signaling.6

Mice with a heterozygous germline Nf1 mutation develop
many of the tumors seen in persons with NF1, which show loss
of the normal allele.7 Homozygous Nf1 inactivation is lethal at
about E137,8; however, fetal hematopoietic cells from these
embryos are hypersensitive to GM-CSF in vitro and induce a
JMML-like MPD when transplanted into irradiated recipient
mice.9,10 Recently, a conditional Nf1 mutant allele and the
interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre strain were harnessed to induce
somatic Nf1 inactivation in hematopoietic cells. Like recipients
given transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells, these Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice consistently develop MPD.11

The GM-CSF receptor shares a common signaling ␤ subunit
(beta c) with the receptors for interleukins 3 and 5.12 Unlike
humans, the mouse has 2 homologous ␤ subunits: beta c and ␤IL-3.

The GM-CSF and IL-5␣ subunits only pair with beta c, whereas
IL-3␣ forms heterodimers with both beta c and ␤IL-3.13 Bone
marrow cells from homozygous beta c mutant (beta c⫺/⫺) mice
respond to IL-3 but not GM-CSF. These mice maintain normal
leukocyte counts.14 We intercrossed beta c and Nf1 mutant mice to
determine the effects on progenitor populations and the MPD
phenotype. We ﬁnd that loss of beta c attenuates the severity of
MPD in Nf1 mutant mice. However, we also demonstrate that
Nf1 inactivation expands immature progenitors even in the
absence of beta c.

recipients (B6.SJL-PtprcaPep3b/BoyJ). Mice were housed in the Univer-
sity of Minnesota Research Animal Resources facilities and all proce-
dures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Results

Studies in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c mutant mice

Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice of all 3 beta c genotypes were generated by
intercrossing. Pups that received a single intraperitoneal injection of
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pI-pC) at 3 to 5 days of age to activate
Cre recombinase expression from the Mx1 promoter were genotyped and
monitored as described previously.11 Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice were
maintained in a sterile animal care facility under a protocol that was
approved by the University of California San Francisco Committee on
Animal Research.

Complete blood counts, ﬂow cytometry,
and pathological analysis

Blood counts were measured in Coulter ZBI (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton
CA) or Hemavet 850 (CDC Technologies, Oxford, CT) instruments. Bone
marrow and blood leukocytes were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on a
FACSCalibur with data analysis via CELLQuest Pro software (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Tissue sections from control and mutant
mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, visualized using a Nikon
Eclipse E400 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with either a
4⫻/0.10 numerical aperture (NA) or a 50⫻/0.90 NA objective. Images
were photographed using a Nikon Coolpix 5000 digital camera.

Colony-forming unit assays

Colony-forming unit granulocyte-erythrocyte-megakaryocyte-macrophage
(CFU-GEMM) assays were performed by seeding bone marrow (3 ⫻ 104)
or spleen cells (1 ⫻ 105) in Methocult (M3434; StemCell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada). Colonies were enumerated at day 7. Spleen
colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assays were performed by injecting bone
marrow cells (6 ⫻ 104) or splenocytes (2 ⫻ 105) intravenously into C57BL/6
recipients that were irradiated with 750 rad. Spleens were harvested from
day 8 and ﬁxed in Tellyesniczky solution (64% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 2%
formaldehyde) to enumerate surface colonies. Splenic CFU-GMs were
enumerated from Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox and control mice in M3231 medium
containing a saturating concentration of IL-3.

Statistical analysis

All graphical and statistical analyses were performed using StatView (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) software with statistical signiﬁcance determined by
ANOVA with Fisher post-hoc tests.

beta c inactivation suppresses MPD in recipients of Nf1 mutant
fetal liver cells

Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ compound mutant mice on an inbred C57BL/6
background were mated to generate E12.5 embryos (Figure 1A). Fetal
livers were removed and made into single-cell suspensions while a
portion of embryonic tissue was used to genotype the Nf1 locus. Nf1⫺/⫺,
beta c⫺/⫺ and Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺cells were pooled separately and 2 ⫻ 106
cells were injected intravenously into lethally irradiated congenic mice.
The C57BL6/J recipients were syngenic to the donor mice, but
expressed a variant allele of the CD45 cell surface antigen (CD45.1) to
distinguish donor-derived from recipient hematopoietic cells by ﬂow
cytometry. To increase the number of recipient mice for subsequent
analysis, the primary recipients were killed 4 to 8 weeks after adoptive
transfer and 5 million bone marrow cells were injected into irradiated
congenic CD45.1⫹ hosts (Figure 1B). These secondary recipients were
monitored for at least 13 months or until they developed overt MPD.
Flow cytometric analysis of primary and secondary recipients demon-
strated high levels of CD45.2 chimerism in recipient bone marrows,
thereby conﬁrming that they were derived from the transplanted fetal
livers (Figure 2A). None of the recipients repopulated with Nf1⫺/⫺, beta
c⫺/⫺ or Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ cells showed leukocytosis, splenomegaly, or
any other evidence of MPD (Figure 2B). Qualitative measurements of
disease burden in mice with MPD correlate with increased numbers of
mature myeloid lineage cells that express the surface markers Gr-1 and
Mac-1. Animals from both cohorts exhibited 52% to 68% Gr-1/Mac-1
double-positive cells in the bone marrow and 12% to 20% in the
peripheral blood. In addition, ﬂow cytometric analysis of splenic cells
revealed only 2% to 7% Gr-1/Mac-1 cells (data not shown). By contrast,
recipients given transplants with C57BL/6 Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells
develop leukocytosis and splenomegaly with myeloid inﬁltration 4 to 6
months after adoptive transfer in primary and secondary recipients.17-19

lymphocytes, with values outside of the normal ranges indicated by the dotted (lymphocyte) and solid (neutrophil) bars. Four data points included for Nf1⫹/⫹, beta c⫹/⫹ primary
recipients to illustrate normal values.

Based on these data, we investigated progenitor colony growth in
recipients of transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ and Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺
fetal liver cells. Whereas splenocytes from Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ and
Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ recipients yielded similar numbers of progenitor
colonies, bone marrow cells from Nf1⫺/⫺, bta c⫺/⫺ recipients contained
signiﬁcantly more CFU-GEMMs (Figure 3). We also observed in-
creased numbers of day 8 CFU-S colonies in the bone marrows of
recipients of transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ versus Nf1⫹/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺
cells (Figure 3).

Loss of ␤c attenuates MPD in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice

While our adoptive transfer experiments were in progress, Zhu and
colleagues reported a conditional mutant Nf1 allele, which they
generated by ﬂanking exons 31 and 32 with loxP sites.16 Somatic
inactivation of this Nf1ﬂox allele, which is functionally wild-type in
the basal state, can be achieved by expressing Cre recombinase in
speciﬁc tissues. Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice in a mixed C57BL/
6 ⫻ 129/Sv genetic background consistently develop a JMML-like
MPD that closely resembles the disorder seen in mice given
transplants with Nf1⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells.11 We generated Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice of all 3 possible ␤c genotypes to examine the effects
of ablating GM-CSF signaling on the MPD phenotype in this
model. Cre recombinase was induced in offspring of Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫺ intercrosses at 3 to 5 days of age by injection of
pI-pC.11 PCR analysis of DNA extracted from blood leukocytes at 6
weeks of age demonstrated efﬁcient Mx1-Cre transgene-dependent
inactivation of Nf1 (data not shown).

Blood counts were compared over time in Mx1-Cre⫹ and
Mx1-Cre⫺ Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox mice of different beta c genotypes. Because
mice with heterozygous inactivation of beta c were similar to beta
c⫹/⫹ animals (data not shown), we focused on 4 cohorts: (1)

Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹; (2) Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺;
(3) Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹; and (4) Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺. Leukocyte
counts were signiﬁcantly elevated in the Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox
animals by 3 months of age irrespective of beta c genotype, which

was due to increased numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells
(Figure 4A-B). The leukocyte counts of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta
c⫹/⫹ mice were persistently elevated at 6 months of age, whereas
the counts of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice were similar to
those of beta c⫹/⫹ and beta c⫺/⫺ mice that did not inherit the
Mx1-Cre transgene and therefore retained wild-type Nf1 function
(Figure 4A). Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ mice developed MPD
between 5 and 7 months of age, characterized by hunching,
abnormal gait, a disheveled appearance, and rising white blood cell
(WBC) counts (Figure 4A). These sick mice were humanely killed
and analyzed with littermates of the other 3 groups. Importantly,
none of the Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ animals were killed due
to signs of systemic illness. The bone marrows of Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ mice were highly cellular with myeloid cells at
various stages of differentiation and a paucity of erythroid ele-
ments, whereas Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ marrows showed less
myeloid proliferation and residual erythropoiesis (data not shown).
Pathologic analysis of sick Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ mice also
uncovered extensive splenic inﬁltration by myeloid and erythroid
cells with effacement of germinal centers (Figure 5A). Splenic
inﬁltration was also present
in some age-matched Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice, but was typically less prominent than in
Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ littermates (Figure 5A). Fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated substantial
numbers of erythroid (Ter119⫹ or CD71⫹ or both) and myeloid
(Gr-1⫹ or Mac-1⫹ or both) cells in the spleens of Mx1-Cre,
Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ and Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice that had
morphologic evidence of inﬁltration (Figure S1, available on the
Blood website; see the Supplemental Figure link at the top of the
online article). We also observed extensive periportal invasion
within the livers of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ animals that was
markedly reduced in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mutant mice
(Figure 5A). The spleens of Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫹/⫹ and
Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice were enlarged (Figure 5B) and
contained granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (Figure 5C).

GM-CSF production by either donor hematopoietic cells or by the

Gmcsf in both donor cells and recipients attenuated the disease
phenotype. However, only 6 primary Gmcsf⫺/⫺ recipients of Nf1,

pected requirement for GM-CSF signaling for efﬁcient engraft-
ment.21 Moreover, 4 of 6 Gmcsf mutant mice that were repopulated
with doubly mutant fetal liver cells developed MPD with pro-
longed latency.18 The ␣ and ␤ subunits of the GM-CSF receptor
form ligand-independent complexes, and it has been suggested that
these preformed receptors normally provide a weak constitutive
survival signal in hematopoietic cells.22 This raised the possibility
that cytokine-independent signaling accounts for the observation
that most of the recipients of Nf1, Gmcsf doubly mutant fetal liver
cells ultimately develop MPD.18 Resolving this question has
therapeutic implications because inhibitors of GM-CSF signaling
have been proposed as a potential strategy for treating JMML.23,24
We ﬁrst used a fetal liver cell adoptive transfer model to demonstrate
that loss of Nf1 results in expansion of early hematopoietic progenitors
(CFU-GEMMs and day 8 CFU-Ss) that is independent of beta c
function. Consistent with these data, competitive repopulation experi-
ments showed Nf1-deﬁcient donor cells have a proliferative advantage
in all hematopoietic lineages, which is greatest in the myeloid compart-
ment.20 Our data extend these studies by demonstrating that Nf1 perturbs
myelopoiesis independent of signaling through beta c.

Despite increased numbers of immature hematopoietic progenitors
in recipients of Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells, loss of beta c
suppressed any evidence of MPD for over 13 months. Although the lack
of a positive control is a potential concern, we did not transplant Nf1⫺/⫺,
beta c⫹/⫹ cells in parallel because previous studies found that Nf1⫺/⫺
fetal livers consistently cause MPD in primary and secondary recipi-
ents.17-19 In contrast to recipients of doubly mutant fetal liver cells,
somatic inactivation of Nf1 in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice
attenuated, but did not eliminate, the MPD phenotype. These data
indicate that beta c function is not essential for myeloid disease.
Deregulated signaling from other cytokine receptors might contribute to
MPD that arises in some Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells. Interestingly,
Nf1⫺/⫺ progenitors are hypersensitive to stem-cell factor (SCF), which
signals through the c-kit receptor.20 Although Nf1⫺/⫺ myeloid progeni-
tors demonstrate a normal pattern of colony growth in response to IL-3
alone, these cells are hypersensitive to the combination of IL-3 plus
SCF.20 Importantly, despite phenotypic differences between recipients of

Nf1⫺/⫺, beta c⫺/⫺ fetal liver cells and Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺
mice, both models infer an important role of GM-CSF signaling in
modulating myeloproliferation in vivo.

The absence of MPD in the adoptive transfer model may have
been due to decreased replicative potential of the donor cells after 2
rounds of transplantation, particularly given the interaction be-
tween GM-CSF signaling and fetal liver cell engraftment.21 It is
also possible that
transplant recipients would have ultimately
developed MPD had we observed them beyond 13 months. On the
other hand, because the Mx1-Cre promoter is active in multiple cell
types, it is possible that nonhematopoietic cells contribute to MPD
pathogenesis in Mx1-Cre, Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, beta c⫺/⫺ mice by secreting
abnormal amounts of cytokines. This idea is consistent with studies
showing that heterozygous inactivation of the Nf1 gene in mice can
induce a “ﬁeld effect” that promotes neuroﬁbroma formation due to
interactions between Schwann cells that have inactivated both Nf1
alleles and heterozygous mutant mast cells and ﬁbroblasts.25

Based on our data and the existing literature, we speculate that
immature and lineage-speciﬁc hematopoietic progenitors require
neuroﬁbromin to negatively regulate multiple extracellular stimuli
in the bone marrow microenvironment that orchestrate the differen-
tiation of stem cells into progenitors and then mature myeloid cells.
Loss of Nf1 results in increased numbers of cells at all stages of
myeloid differentiation. Although we have shown that immature
hematopoietic progenitors accumulate in the absence of beta c, our
data also demonstrate that GM-CSF signaling is required for a fully
penetrant MPD phenotype. Previous in vitro and in vivo data
support the idea that interfering with GM-CSF signaling may
inhibit the growth of JMML cells.18,23,24 However, the GM-CSF–
independent proliferation of immature Nf1 mutant progenitors also
infers that curing this aggressive MPD will require inhibiting beta c
in combination with other strategies.
