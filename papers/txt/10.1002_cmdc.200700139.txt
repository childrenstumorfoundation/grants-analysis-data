Lessons Learnt from Assembling Screening Libraries for
Drug Discovery for Neglected Diseases
Ruth Brenk,* Alessandro Schipani, Daniel James, Agata Krasowski, Ian Hugh Gilbert,
Julie Frearson, and Paul Graham Wyatt[a]

To enable the establishment of a drug discovery operation for ne-
glected diseases, out of 2.3 million commercially available com-
pounds 222 552 compounds were selected for an in silico library,
57 438 for a diverse general screening library, and 1 697 com-
pounds for a focused kinase set. Compiling these libraries re-
quired a robust strategy for compound selection. Rules for un-
wanted groups were defined and selection criteria to enrich for
lead-like compounds which facilitate straightforward structure–
activity relationship exploration were established. Further, a liter-
ature and patent review was undertaken to extract key recogni-

tion elements of kinase inhibitors (“core fragments”) to assemble
a focused library for hit discovery for kinases. Computational and
experimental characterisation of the general screening library re-
vealed that the selected compounds 1) span a broad range of
lead-like space, 2) show a high degree of structural integrity and
purity, and 3) demonstrate appropriate solubility for the purposes
of biochemical screening. The implications of this study for com-
pound selection, especially in an academic environment with lim-
ited resources, are considered.

Introduction

The pharmaceutical industry has a long track record of deliver-
ing innovative therapeutics. However, because of economic
reasons, this industry is mainly investing in therapeutic areas
for which a commercially viable return can be expected.[1] Con-
sequentially, only little translational research is carried out on
orphan or neglected diseases where either few or poor people
are affected.[2, 3] For instance, of the more than 1 300 new drugs
introduced between 1975 and 1999, only 13 were for infec-
tious parasitic diseases, which together account for a third of
the worldwide disease burden.[4] Therefore, to tackle orphan or
neglected diseases either the pharmaceutical industry must be
given incentives to work on them or not-for-profit organisa-
tions need to be enabled to do drug discovery.[3, 5] Increasingly,
academic groups are either partnering with industry or are re-
cruiting experienced people from industry to guide and sup-
port their drug discovery efforts, creating an environment
which allows professional translational research and opens up
access to key technologies, such as screening facilities and li-
braries for hit discovery.[6]

Over recent decades library screening has become an impor-
tant source of hits for drug discovery programmes.[7, 8] Three
main technologies are used: 1) virtual screening of in silico li-
braries to identify small sets of compounds for biochemical
assays,[9, 10] 2) fragment-based screening using high-throughput
x-ray crystallography or NMR methods to discover relatively
small compounds which bind with high ligand efficiency to
the target,[11] and 3) high-throughput biochemical screening
(HTS) of either diverse chemical
libraries or focused libraries
tailored for specific gene families.[12, 13] After initially very disap-
pointing HTS outcomes it became evident that the quality of
the compound collection is crucial for success.[12, 14] It is now
generally accepted that the physicochemical properties of the

compounds, the absence of compounds containing toxic or re-
active moieties, and lead- or drug likeness are important fac-
tors when compiling screening libraries.[12, 15] A more controver-
sial point is the required size and diversity of general purpose
screening libraries. In the pharmaceutical industry, these libra-
ries can contain over a million compounds; usually a combina-
tion of commercially available and proprietary compounds.[8]
These organisations balance the cost of screening many hun-
dreds of thousands of inactive compounds against the benefits
such as directly establishing structure–activity relationships
(SAR) from the screening data and increasing the chances of
identifying a broad range of hit series. The latter point is par-
ticularly important in a competitive environment to maximise
the chances of discovering structural classes without patent
issues.

On the other hand, smaller libraries containing between
14 000 and 135 000 compounds have been successfully
screened for hit discovery.[16–19] In a less competitive area with
restricted resources, such as translational research for orphan
or neglected diseases, these smaller libraries are very appeal-
ing. Such collections might not reveal every single hit series
that would have been discovered using larger libraries and
only limited initial SAR, but by careful selection of libraries to
lead-like chemical space in as diverse as possible
cover

they should generate
sufficient information to initiate
a drug discovery programme. In
this case the initial screen will
need to be followed by further
rounds of purchase of com-
pound analogues and screening
to validate and expand the SAR
around the hits.

Absence of unwanted function-
alities:
Lead-like properties:

Limited complexity:

At the University of Dundee,
we are particularly interested in
drug discovery for neglected
parasitic diseases. A diverse set
of enzymes targets in various
pathways has been validated as
potential drug targets for these diseases.[20] Many of these tar-
gets are novel with little precedence for drug discovery and
either no or only limited drug-like inhibitors are known. To
tackle these targets efficiently with up-to-date drug discovery
methods, a diverse screening library is needed.[6, 12] The three
dimensional structures for some targets have been determined
allowing virtual screening as a complementary approach to
high volume biochemical screening.[21]
In addition, there are
also potential parasite targets that are homologues of well-
known drug targets, such as parasite protein kinases.[22] Exten-
sive research, especially in the oncology area, has resulted in
approved drugs and demonstrated that kinases are highly
druggable.[23] Many chemical scaffolds that inhibit human kin-
ases are known and it can be assumed that these scaffolds can
also serve as starting points for parasitic kinase inhibitors accel-
erating the entry into kinase drug discovery for parasitic indica-
tions.[6]

Due to the large attrition rate in drug discovery[6, 24] and the
diversity and lack of precedent for many potential parasite
drug targets,[20] we decided not to focus our drug discovery ef-
forts on one particular target class but to cover a broad range
of targets. To enable this concept we compiled three different
libraries: one diverse in silico library for virtual screening, one
diverse screening compound library, and a focused compound
library for the discovery of kinase inhibitors. Herein, we report
on our approach to assemble these libraries and on their quali-
ty assessment. Furthermore, we also discuss general
lessons
which can be drawn for compound selection.

Overview of the compound selection proce-
dure

Three different libraries were assembled: a virtual screening set
representing valuable starting points for lead optimisation pro-
grammes, a HTS library intended to be a diverse subset of
these compounds, and a kinase library containing compounds
that are likely to inhibit kinases. To ensure selection of high
quality compounds, the following selection criteria were de-
fined (Table 1):

Absence of unwanted functionalities. Compounds contain-
ing unwanted functionalities were removed as it is not desira-
ble to waste resources removing such functionalities in the hit

No unwanted groups (see supplementary material)

10–27 heavy atoms
< 4 hydrogen-bond donors
< 7 hydrogen-bond acceptors
0 < (hydrogen-bond donors + hydrogen bond acceptors) < 10

outside the ring.

optimization phase. These included potentially mutagenic
groups such as nitro groups, groups likely to have unfavoura-
ble pharmacokinetic properties such as sulfates and phos-
phates; and reactive groups such as 2-halopyridines or thiols
(Table S1). Furthermore, compounds which are likely to inter-
fere with typical HTS assays were also excluded.

Lead-like properties. Generally, molecular weight, lipophilic-
ity, and number of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors of a
compound are increased in the lead optimisation process.[25, 26]
Consequently, we decided not to purchase drug-like com-
pounds as defined by “Lipinski’s rule of 5” but to select com-
pounds that are smaller and less hydrophobic to leave oppor-
tunities for optimisation.[27]
In particular, we restricted the
ClogP/ClogD to between zero and four, the number of hydro-
gen-bond donors and acceptors to fewer than four and seven,
respectively, and the number of heavy atoms to between ten
and 27.

Limited complexity. Given the low probability of any one
chemical hit (series) being successfully progressed to a preclini-
cal candidate, we sought chemically tractable compound scaf-
folds to allow the facile synthesis of diverse arrays of com-
pounds to explore structure–activity relationships (SAR), allow-
ing rapid go/no go decisions on any particular series. There-
fore, only compounds with limited complexity defined as
fewer than eight rotatable bonds, fewer than five ring systems,
and no ring systems with more than two fused rings were in-
cluded.

A hierarchical filter protocol was established to enrich the
desired compounds (Figure 1). After pooling supplier cata-
logues and filtering for duplicates, compounds that contained
unwanted functionalities were removed. Definitions of these
groups were derived from the literature, and augmented with
our own in-house rules based on medicinal chemical experi-
ence (Table S1).[28, 29] In the next step we filtered for compounds
with lead-like properties and limited complexity (Table 1). All
compounds passing these filters were regarded as, in general,
valuable starting points for medicinal chemistry programmes
and are used for virtual screening campaigns (VS set). Finally,
for the HTS library the number of compounds was reduced fur-
ther by cluster analyses and visual inspection. All compounds
in the VS set were clustered based on Tanimoto similarity.

to different chemical classes have been described.[23] Most of
these inhibitors contain a core fragment that binds in the
kinase adenine binding pocket and forms hydrogen-bonds
with backbone amide groups of the amino acids that comprise
the so-called hinge region (Figure 3).[30] Specificity for different

> 0.9 to a member of the same cluster were rejected to avoid
redundant information. In the last step at least one representa-
tive of each cluster was visually inspected to remove com-
pounds that, based on our experience, are unsuitable starting
points for chemistry programs because they: 1) contain poten-
tially reactive or toxic groups for which no filter rules were de-
fined (Figure 2 a,b); 2) appear under functionalised compared
to their size (Figure 2 c,d); or 3) are already highly functional-
ised and therefore left limited options for optimisation (Fig-
ure 2 e,f). This last visual
inspection was carried out by two
people, to provide a consensus and to ensure consistency.

For the assembly of the focused kinase library a more ration-
al approach was chosen. Numerous kinase inhibitors belonging

kinases is achieved by appropriate decoration of these core
fragments with groups that enable interactions with the more
variable parts of adjacent binding pockets. A focused library
with a relatively high hit rate for a diverse panel of kinases
should therefore contain a broad variety of core fragments
that are decorated with diverse substituents. Following these
considerations, again a hierarchical filter protocol was estab-
lished.
In the first step, an extensive literature and patent
review was carried out to assemble a list of kinase inhibitors
with core fragments that potentially bind into the adenine
pockets of kinases. In the next step, the VS set was screened
for compounds that contained the desired core fragments. In
the last step, where more than 50 examples of a fragment
were retrieved, in iterative cycles similar representatives of the
same core fragment were rejected until 50 compounds were
left.

Methods

Descriptor calculations

In-house Python scripts based on Openeye’s OEToolkit (Open-
eye, Santa Fe, USA) were used for compound manipulation
and calculating descriptors for the number of heavy atoms, hy-
drogen-bond donors and acceptors, ring systems, and rotata-
ble bonds. SD files provided by the suppliers were converted

into SMILES strings. Protonation and tautomeric states of the
compounds were standardised based on predefined substruc-
ture patterns to remove duplicates. In silico ADME parameters
were calculated using ADMEnsa Interactive (BioFocus DPI, Saf-
fron Walden, UK). Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, USA) was used to cal-
culate ClogP values. Compounds containing groups that are
charged at physiological pH were neutralised before calculat-
ing ClogP values. The ClogP values obtained for compounds
where converted to clogD values by equation 1 and a pKa of
four was assumed for acetyl-sulfonamides, a pKa of five for car-
boxylic acids and tetrazoles, a pKa of six for aromatic thiols,
and a pKa of nine for amines.

Compounds and their descriptors were stored in a MySQL
database and visualised using Vida and the Ogham package
(Openeye).

Compound clustering

Compounds were clustered using the Jarvis-Patrick algorithm
of the Daylight clustering package (Daylight, Aliso Viejo, USA).
Compounds had to have at least nine of 15 neighbours in
common to be allowed to belong to the same cluster and
compounds for which the nearest neighbour had a Tanimoto
coefficient of less than 0.8 were classified as singletons. Com-
pounds within a cluster that had a Tanimoto coefficient of
larger than 0.9 with a member of the same cluster were delet-
ed. In the first round of purchasing we required a minimum
cluster size of five. In the second purchase round no minimum
cluster size was required.

Kinase library

Kinase core fragments were manually extracted from literature
and patents and represented by SMARTS strings with the help
of Openeye’s mdl2sma tool. Python scripts using the Open-
eye’s OEToolkit were used to retrieve matching compounds. In
cases in which a core fragment occurred in more than 50 dif-
ferent compounds, the cluster size was reduced in iterative
cycles. In the first cycle, all compounds that had a Tanimoto
similarity > 0.9 (based on Daylight fingerprints) to a member in
the same cluster were removed. In subsequent cycles, the Tani-
moto threshold was reduced stepwise by 0.1 until the desired
cluster size was reached.

Automatic core fragment extraction

In a variation of previously published methods, a core frag-
ment was defined as a ring plus the directly attached polar
functional groups (Figure 4).[31, 32] Polar functional groups were
specified as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms directly linked to
these types of atoms, carbonyl groups, or double or triple
bonded carbon atoms. Fragments only containing carbon
atoms or carbon atoms and aromatic sulfur or oxygen atoms

carbon atoms that are not part of a polar functional group or a ring system
are removed. Functional groups linking ring systems are added to all adja-
cent rings.

were discounted. The details of the method will be published
elsewhere.

Solubility screening

The complete compound collection was solubilised as 10 mm
master stocks in 100 % DMSO and daughter sets were pre-
pared at 3 mm for routine screening campaigns. All sets were
stored at  20 8C under reduced humidity conditions prior to
use. For the screen, 1 mL of each compound was dry spotted
into 384 well plates (Hummingbird, Genomic Solutions Inc.)
prior to addition of 100 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
pH 7.4 (Flexdrop, Perkin–Elmer Inc.), resulting in a compound
concentration per well of 30 mm at 1 % DMSO. After equilibra-
tion for 1 h at room temperature plates were read at A620nm in
an Envision plate reader (Perkin–Elmer Inc.). Pyrene (30 mm)
was used as an internal plate control (16 wells per plate); back-
ground equated to PBS alone (16 wells per plate).

Results

Compound selection for the VS and HTS sets

For logistical reasons compound selection for the VS and HTS
sets was performed in two rounds. In the first round, only one
supplier offering a large number of compounds (Chemdiv) was
considered. In the second round we then increased the size of
the library by adding compounds from additional suppliers
(Table 2).
In total, 605 230 compounds were included in the
first round and 2 262 339 in the second round (Table 3). Remov-
al of duplicates and compounds with unwanted functionalities
resulted in 486 453 and 932 081 compounds, respectively. Out
of those, 95 469 and 222 552 compounds, respectively fulfilled
the criteria for lead-like properties (Table 1) and were included
in the VS set. For the HTS set the number of compounds was
reduced further by cluster analyses and visual inspection. Clus-
tering the VS set of the first purchasing round in which a mini-
mum cluster size of five was required resulted in 3 747 clusters
and the second round, in which no cut-off was applied, result-
ed in 9 705 clusters and 31105 singletons (Figure 5). The maxi-
mum cluster size was 62 and 60 compounds, and 74.3 % and
93.3 % of the clusters contained ten or less members in the

first and second round, respectively. Visual inspection of these
clusters reduced the size further to 29 206 and 55 184 com-
pounds, respectively, out of which 24 047 compounds were
purchased in the first purchasing round and 33 391 in the
second round (the large discrepancy between the numbers of
compounds passing the visual
inspection filter step and the
number of compounds actually purchased in the second pur-
chasing round is due to the fact that most of these com-
pounds were already purchased previously).

Compound selection for the focused kinase library

A literature and patent review identified 113 core fragments
that potentially bind into the adenine pockets of kinases
(Table 4, S2). Substructure searching of these core fragments in
the VS set resulted in zero hits for 31 core fragments, less than
50 hits for 40 core fragments,
and 50 or more hits for 42 core
fragments. After rejecting similar
compounds
representing core
fragments for which more than
50 examples were retrieved,
1 697 compounds were identi-
fied.

2nd Round

Computational characterisation
of the HTS library

The content of the HTS library
was characterised in terms of
distribution of 1D properties
and core fragment diversity. Frequency distribution histograms
show that the selected compounds cover a broad range of
lead-like chemical space (Figure 6). Most compounds in the
purchased library have one hydrogen-bond donor group (54 %
of the library), 3–4 hydrogen-bond acceptors (57 %), 20–25
heavy atoms (60 %), 4–6 rotatable bonds (61 %), and a ClogP/
ClogD between three and four (35 %). According to in silico
ADME property calculations 74 % of the compounds are able
to penetrate the blood-brain barrier
(log([brain/blood]) >
 0.5), 96 % are classified to be orally available (human intesti-
nal absorption > 30 %), 79 % inhibit the Ether-a-go-go-related
gene (hERG) potassium channel only with pIC50 < 6, 70 % are
not transported by P-glycoproteins (P-gp), and 30 % show less
than 80 % plasma protein binding (Table 5).

[a] In the first round only compounds from Chemdiv were considered, in the second round all available com-
pounds from the suppliers listed in Table 1 were filtered.

To analyse the diversity of the library, core fragments were
extracted from the compounds (Figure 4). The purchased li-
brary contains 4 812 different core fragments. For 93 % of
these core fragments there are less than 50 different examples
in the screening library and 50 % of the fragments occur only
in one or two compounds (Figure 7).

ment of purity and identity for a random sample and kinetic
solubility of the entire collection. A randomly selected sample

Virtual screening and large-scale
biochemical screening are es-
tablished tools for hit discov-
ery.[10, 12]
In the past, especially
HTS has mainly taken place in
industry but screening centres
are increasingly being estab-
lished in academia to address
gaps left by industrial activi-
ties.[6] As academic institutions
often have no historical com-
pound library, the opportunity
arises to assemble a screening
library from first principles. By
going through two iterative
cycles of compound selection
we selected 57 438 compounds
for a general purpose screening
library and 1 697 compounds
for a focused kinase set. Four
points stand out from this exer-
cise. First, by restricting com-
pound selection to compounds
that are diverse and lead-like, a
HTS library of a size which is
suitable for drug discovery in an
academic setting can be assem-
bled. Second, the selected compounds cover a broad range of
lead-like chemical space and are generally of high quality in
terms of purity and identity. Furthermore, triaging the com-
mercially available compounds with our filter criteria led to a
high rate of soluble compounds. Third, despite the size of the
commercial compound space, compounds containing some
rather simple core fragments are lacking. Fourth, the detailed
implementation of a compound selection cascade is depen-
dent upon prior drug discovery experience. We consider these
points further below.

comprising 1 % of the collection was checked for purity and
structural
integrity by LC-MS. The vast majority of the com-
pounds (98 %) gave the expected molecular identity according
to molecular weight and 96 % of those tested returned purities
equal to or greater than our acceptance threshold of 90 %. The
majority of those which failed returned purities above 70 %.

The solubility screen demonstrated excellent statistical per-
formance yielding mean A620nm reading of 0.07 0.004 (mean
 SD) for the standard compound across a total of 178 assay
plates, with a mean Z’ for the assay of 0.77 0.06. Figure 8 il-
lustrates the distribution of compound readings for the first
30 000 of the compounds tested, relative to the standard. Anal-
ysis of the complete data set revealed that 1.3 % of the collec-
tion gave readings within 3 x SD and above the mean of the
standard compound. We considered these compounds to have
likely solubility issues at the typical concentration for primary
screening (30 mm) and they were annotated in our database
accordingly.

Suitable screening sets for academic environments

Screening sets with more than one million compounds are
often used in the pharmaceutical
industry, but they are too
costly and resource intensive for academic settings. However,
even the large sets cover only a tiny fraction of drug-like
chemical space. In addition, the hit rates with these large sets
can still be very disappointing.[13, 33] By restricting compound
size and complexity to those of lead-like compounds, smaller
libraries which still provide a reasonable coverage of chemical
space can be assembled, as the magnitude of chemical space
is exponentially smaller for lead-like than for drug-like com-
pounds.[34] For instance, a theoretical study has shown that less
than 14 million molecules consisting of up to eleven N, O, C,
and S atoms can potentially be synthesised whereas drug-like
chemical space was estimated to exceed 1060 molecules.[35, 36]
Further, although the binding affinities of lead-like compounds

can be weaker than those of drug-like compounds, smaller
compounds have a higher likelihood of binding to a target.[25]
Finally, when going from lead to drug, compounds usually in-
crease in size,
lipophilicity, and number of hydrogen-bond
donors and acceptors, again supporting the idea to start with
molecules that are smaller than average drugs.[15, 26, 37] But how
small should the compounds be? At the extreme end are frag-
ments, which are often described with the rule of three (MW <
300, logP  3, number of hydrogen-bond donors  3, number
of hydrogen-bond acceptors  6).[11, 38] Typical fragment libra-
ries contain only between a few hundred and 10 000 small
compounds. Compared to conventional HTS hits the often less
potent fragments have the advantage that they usually have
an optimal fit to the binding site and can therefore readily be
optimised. Biophysical methods such as NMR and X-ray crystal-
lography are routinely used to identify these weak binding hits

but Makara argues that when using more densely populated
traditional screens can also be applied.[39]
fragments sets,
Based on these considerations we decided to choose com-
pounds that are at the upper end of the fragment space or
slightly bigger and more complex (Table 1) with the goal of
obtaining initial hits with affinities that are detectable in a bio-
chemical assay setting but are still amenable to optimisation.
After applying our selection criteria for unwanted groups, limit-
ed complexity, and lead-likeness, only a fraction of the com-
mercially available compounds is left (Table 3). Out of 1.7 mil-
lion examined compounds only 222 552 (13 %) pass all defined
filters for compounds suitable for virtual screening. This set is
already considerably smaller than typical screening libraries in
industry. By rejecting similar compounds and visual inspection
we reduced its size further to approximately 57 000 com-
pounds, an appropriately sized set for an academic setting.

Figure 7. Core fragment representation in purchased library. The slices indi-

acceptors, heavy atoms, and rotatable bonds (Figure 6). The
uneven distribution of 1D properties in the purchased library
reflects the representation of these properties in the commer-
cially available compounds. For the number of hydrogen-bond
donors and acceptors the library of commercially available
compounds peaks at similar values whereas 47 % of the avail-
able compounds are larger than our chosen cut-off of 27
heavy atoms and 43 % fall outside the required ClogP/ClogD
range. Commercial
libraries have clearly improved compared
to the early days of combinatorial chemistry and HTS, but
there is still room for improvement in the design of com-
pounds for more resource efficient screening strategies.

The diversity of the screening library was assessed based on
a representation of core fragments (Figure 4). The final set con-
tains almost 5 000 different fragments out of which 93 % are
represented by less than 50 different examples demonstrating
that our compound selection and clustering protocol resulted
in a diverse set (Figure 7). However, some core fragments are
under-represented, for example, 50 % of the core fragments
occur only in one or two compounds. Therefore in the future,
we will purchase additional compounds which either increase
the representation of sparsely populated core fragments or
contain new core fragments.

Structural

integrity and purity analysis demonstrated that
the compounds from a broad range of suppliers were of high
quality, as almost all of the randomly tested compounds were
the expected structure and at least 90 % pure. Continuing LC-
MS quality control of hits from screening campaigns gives a
similar rate to those from the initial random sampling of 1 % of
the library.

A simple and rapid assessment of the solubility of all mem-
bers of our new library revealed that only 1.3 % of the com-
pounds have solubility issues. As a result of the known perfor-
mance problems of solubility prediction models across multi-
ple compound series we did not attempt to calculate this
property or use it as a selection filter.[40] However, we hypoth-
esised that selecting rather small, non highly lipophilic com-
pounds for our library would be beneficial for aqueous solubili-
ty. This was indeed confirmed by the solubility screen.

Figure 8. Distribution of solubility assessment readings for first 30,000 com-
pounds at 30 mm. Test compound data are expressed relative to the positive
control pyrene (solubility < 10 mm) (red line). Green line denotes 3xSD below
the mean pyrene control. All compounds with readings on or above the
green line were annotated as having potential solubility issues at 30 mm.

Quality of selected screening set

The selected compounds span a broad range of
lead-like
chemical space (Figure 6) and show overall good in silico
ADME properties (Table 5). The high percentage of compounds
that are predicted to penetrate the blood-brain barrier was not
intended but is an added bonus as our primary disease focus,
human African sleeping sickness, requires CNS active com-
pounds to treat the late stage of the disease.[2] Interestingly,
the 1D properties are not equally represented by the com-
pounds in the library but the representation follows an almost
normal distribution for the number of hydrogen-bond donors,

Gaps in commercial compound space

Assembling the focused kinase library where examples of spe-
cific structural classes were sought revealed gaps in commer-
cial compound space. Almost 30 % of the core fragments were
not commercially available and 35 % occurred in fewer than 50
compounds. This was not due to our filter criteria as these
gaps also existed in the unfiltered library (Table 4). These re-
sults re-emphasise that it is not the absolute number of com-
mercially available compounds that is critical but how diverse
they are. Clearly, at least a third of the known kinase inhibitor
cores could not be discovered with screening libraries assem-
bled from commercially available compounds.

Academic Screening Libraries

Expert knowledge influences the detailed implementation
of a compound selection cascade

The implementation of a compound selection cascade is
biased by the experience and intuition of the medicinal chem-
ists involved.
It is generally accepted that compounds in a
screening library should be diverse, lead-like or drug-like, and
free of problematic functionalities. The differences arise when
this concept is translated into a detailed protocol. How exactly
are lead- and drug-likeness defined? Which moieties are con-
sidered problematic? Which diversity measure should be
used? In industry, data generated in screens over the last
decade can be mined to inform compound selection.[41–44] Aca-
demia, however,
is just starting to use this technology and
does not have access to historical data. To avoid duplicating ef-
forts and to enable research groups to learn from each other,
it is desirable that the emerging screening centres share their
compound selection protocols and screening results.
In this
context, PubChem is a promising start.

One lesson we learned from our selection process was how
to ensure and assess the diversity of the library. During visual
inspection of the clustering results, we noticed that: 1) some
clusters contained compounds that appeared to have relatively
little structural similarity, or 2) sometimes compounds that we
identified as having structural similarity, were found in different
clusters. Inspired by the core fragment-based approach used
for assembling the focused kinase library we then tried to
mimic that approach for the screening library. Interestingly, ret-
rospective analysis showed that the applied clustering strategy
resulted in a good representation of most of the core frag-
ments (Figure 7) indicating that a broadly similar library would
have been obtained if a core fragment-based approach for
compound selection was adopted. However, as noted earlier,
the extracted core fragments are more meaningful for medici-
nal chemists than a randomly chosen cluster representative
during visual inspection.[31, 32, 45] In addition, by using the core
fragment-based approach,
(1 755 versus
31105) and clusters (3 057 versus 9 705) were found in the fil-
tered library speeding up this process. For these reasons, we
have already used this approach to extend the focused kinase
set to 3 885 compounds and are currently in the process of ap-
plying it to expand the general screening compound library.

Conclusions

To select a library of a size that is suitable for an environment
with restricted resources, such as hit discovery for orphan or
neglected diseases, we established a series of selection filters
to identify a lead-like library of compounds which would be re-
garded by medicinal chemists as good starting points for opti-
misation campaigns. Using this process we selected 222 552
compounds for a virtual screening library and 57 438 com-
pounds for a general screening library. These compounds span
a broad area of lead-like chemical space and show good in sili-
co ADME properties. Chemical identity, purity, and solubility as-
sessments and diversity analysis showed that
the general
screening library is of high quality. Furthermore, using a ration-

al approach 1 697 compounds were selected for a focused
kinase set which was subsequently expanded to 3 885 com-
pounds.

Of course, the ultimate test of the quality of a chemical li-
brary is its ability to produce valuable chemical starting points
in screening campaigns. Such campaigns are underway and
preliminary results look promising. In the first HTS screen un-
dertaken, 1.3 % of compounds were found to be hits (as de-
fined by showing > 50 % inhibition at 30 mm). These were re-
confirmed and a further selection made for IC50 determination.
This led to identification of a number of chemically tractable,
lead-like compound series which were subsequently validated
in terms of resynthesis, exploration of SAR, and mechanism of
action studies. Furthermore, screening the kinase set against a
parasitic kinase revealed eight hit series, four of which are cur-
rently undergoing hit-to-lead chemistry.
