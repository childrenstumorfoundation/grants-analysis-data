Summary The HGF/MET signaling pathway regulates a
wide variety of normal cellular functions that can be subverted
to support neoplasia, including cell proliferation, survival,
apoptosis, scattering and motility, invasion, and angiogenesis.
MET over-expression (with or without gene amplification),
aberrant autocrine or paracrine ligand production, and mis-
sense MET mutations are mechanisms that lead to activation
of the MET pathway in tumors and are associated with poor
prognostic outcome. We report here preclinical development

LY2801653 also maintained potency against 13 MET var-
iants, each bearing a single-point mutation. In subsequent
nonclinical characterization, LY2801653 was found to have
potent activity against several other receptor tyrosine oncoki-

The potential value of MET and other inhibited targets within
a number of malignancies (such as colon, bile ducts, and lung)

Introduction

W. J. Yang
Formerly at Eli Lilly and Company,

The human MET proto-oncogene encodes the MET kinase,
also known as HGF receptor. HGF binds with high affinity

834

Invest New Drugs (2013) 31:833–844

to this trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is the
only known ligand for this receptor. Binding of HGF to the
extracellular domain of MET induces receptor multimeriza-
tion, activates the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor and
results in the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues
in the intracellular region. The HGF/MET signaling path-
way regulates a wide variety of normal cellular functions
that can be subverted to support neoplasia including cell
proliferation, survival, apoptosis, scattering and motility,
invasion, and angiogenesis [1]. Dysregulated MET/HGF
signaling leads to an abnormally activated cellular invasive
program that plays a role in cellular transformation;
epithelial-mesenchymsal transition; and tumor invasion,
progression and metastasis. MET over-expression (with or
without gene amplification), aberrant autocrine or paracrine
ligand production, and missense MET mutations are mech-
anisms that lead to activation of the MET pathway in tumors
and are associated with poor prognostic outcome [2]. Over-
expression of MET, ligand-dependent activation, or MET
amplification have also been implicated as potential mecha-
nisms of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) inhibitor therapies [3–6]. Receptor cross-activation
of other oncoproteins such as MST1R (also known as RON),
AXL and PDGFRA by MET has also been reported [7, 8]. We
report the discovery and initial in vitro and in vivo evaluation
of a small-molecule inhibitor LY2801653, whose develop-
ment was initiated with the intent of targeting the MET kinase.
We provide data to illustrate the in vitro effects of LY2801653
on the MET pathway-dependent cell scattering and cell pro-
liferation, as well as its in vivo anti-tumor effects in mouse
xenograft models. In subsequent nonclinical characterization,
LY2801653 was screened against a larger panel of kinases and
was found to have potent activity against several other recep-
tor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R (MET related
tyrosine kinase), FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, and ROS1,
and against the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2. The po-
tential value of MET and other inhibited targets within a
number of malignancies is discussed. LY2801653 is currently
in phase 1 clinical testing in patients with advanced cancer
(trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037).

The cell lines U-87MG, H441, H1299, MV4-11, HT29,
H460, TT, Calu1, U118MG, A375, HCT-116, DU145,
T47D and H1993 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas,
VA). S114 cells were licensed from National Institute of
Health; HCC78 and BaF3 cells were from DSMZ
(Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zell-
kulturen, Braunschweig, Germany); MKN45 cells from

the Japanese Health Science Research Resources Bank
(Osaka, Japan); A2780 cells from NCI DCTD reposito-
ry, and the KP4 cells from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba,
Japan); HUVECs were obtained from Invitrogen (Madison,
WI). Cells were cultured according to manufacturers’
guidelines.

Chemical synthesis of LY2801653

The synthesis of LY2801653 is described in Example 1 of
the patent [9].

MET inhibition enzyme kinetics studies

The dissociation constant (Ki) value, mode of inhibition
(competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive) and the
pharmacodynamic residence time (Koff) value of
LY2801653 for the MET kinase activity were determined
using radiometric-filter binding and spin column assays.
Methods for these assays are described in detail in the
Supplementary Methods section.

Co-crystallization of LY2801653 with MET and crystal
structure determination

MET kinase domain (amino acid boundaries 1056–1364)
was co-expressed with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B
(PTP1B) and purified by Kinasia (Carmel, IN) similarly to
previous work by Wang et al. [10]. MET protein was puri-
fied by nickel affinity and MonoQ chromatography and
concentrated to 8 mg/mL in 20 mM MES (pH 6.0),
500 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, and 2 mM DTT. The buffer
was adjusted to 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl,
5 % glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-
maltoside for crystallization with 10 mg/mL MET incubated
with 1 mM LY2801653 (1 % DMSO). Crystals were grown
by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C, with reservoir
solution of 16 % PEG 10,000, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 %
ethylene glycol, and optimized by microseeding. Crystals
were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20 % glycerol.
Crystals of MET/LY2801653 belong to space group
P212121 with unit cell parameters a 040.51 Å, b 0
63.89 Å, c0111.63 Å. The diffraction data (1.8 Å, 99.7 %
complete) were collected and processed on SGX-CAT beam
line at APS in Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal
structure was determined by the method of molecular re-
placement using 1 internal MET structure as a search model.
The Flynn program (OpenEye Scientific Software) was used
for ligand fitting and Coot [11] was used in model building.
Structure refinement (Rwork 00.216 and Rfree 00.249,
RMSbond 00.009, RMSangle 01.218) was carried out by
Refmac5 [12]. Protein Data Bank accession code for the
co-crystal structure is 4EEV.

Cell-based assays to determine the inhibition (IC50) of MET
auto-phosphorylation by LY2801653

In vitro HGF induced cell scattering assay

Inhibition of auto-phosphorylation of MET by LY2801653
was assessed in two cell lines by ELISA. One measured
the HGF stimulated MET auto-phosphorylation of Y1349
in H460 cells. Another measured the MET auto-
phosphorylation at Y1230/Y1234/Y1235 in NIH3T3-
derived S114 cells engineered to stably express human
MET and HGF [13]. For details, see the Supplementary
Method section.

In vitro inhibitory activity of LY2801653 on MET-activating
mutations

line,

Translocated promoter region-MET (TPR-MET) oncogene
[14] was cloned into the pLNCX2 vector (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and various
reported MET mutations in hereditary papillary renal
cell carcinoma were introduced using the QuikChange™
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA). BaF3 cells are an immortalized murine bone mar-
row–derived pro-B-cell
the proliferation of which
depends on the presence of IL3. These cells were trans-
duced with retrovirus containing each of the TPR-MET
mutation-bearing constructs as previously described
[15]. BaF3 cell
lines expressing these MET mutations
were confirmed with bidirectional DNA sequencing,
using 3730xl DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media+
10 % dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen # 26400-044) and antibi-
otic/antimycotic (Invitrogen # 15240-067). 4.5×103 cells
(-IL3) or 1.8×103 cells (+IL3) (10 ng/mL, R&D Sys-
tems, # 403-ml) were plated onto 96-well plates, treated
with LY2801653, and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C.
WST1 reagent (Roche, #11644807001) was added and
incubated for 2 h; absorbance was read at OD450. The
IC50 values were determined with the JOCKYSS
program.

In vitro biochemical kinase specificity profiling of LY2801653

The specificity of the inhibitory activity of LY2801653 was
determined using single-point or 3-point profiling and con-
firmatory 10-point or 11-point IC50 assays available at EMD
Millipore Inc. (Dundee, UK), Cerep (Poitiers, France), or
KinomeScan (DiscoveRx, San Diego, CA). These assays
used active full-length or receptor tyrosine kinase domain
enzymes, and peptide or protein substrates unique to each
enzyme. Reactions were run at or near the Km for ATP to
allow for direct comparisons of IC50 potency between the
enzymes. For details, see the Supplementary Method
section.

2×103 DU145 cells/well on poly-D-lysine 96-well black/
clear plates were treated with LY2801653 (in 0.4 %
DMSO), immediately followed by the addition of human
HGF (20 ng/ml), and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. 2 %
formaldehyde fixed cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488
Phalloidin (#A12379,
Invitrogen, Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, CA) and counterstained with Propidium Iodide
(# P3566 Invitrogen). Colony counts were quantified
on Acumen Explorer™ laser-scanning fluorescence
microplate cytometer (TTP Labtech Ltd, Cambridge,
MA). A colony was defined as≥4 cells.

Cell-based assays to determine the inhibition (IC50) of non-
MET kinases by LY2801653

Cell-based assays (anti-proliferative or inhibition of phos-
phorylation of target kinase) were performed to evaluate the
inhibitory activity of LY2801653 against MST1R, AXL,
ROS1, PDGFRA, MKNK1/2, FLT3, MERTK, TYRO3,
TEK, KDR, CSF1R, RET, DDR1, DDR2. for details, see
the Supplementary Method section.

In vivo mouse studies

All animal studies were performed in accordance with
American Association for Laboratory Animal Care institu-
tional guidelines. All in vivo experimental protocols were
approved by the Eli Lilly and Company Animal Care and
Use Committee. Athymic nude mice and CD-1 nude mice
were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and Charles
River (Wilmington, MA), respectively. In all in vivo studies,
LY2801653 was formulated in 10 % acacia daily and dosed
orally. The in vivo mouse studies explored the MET target
inhibition and pharmacokinetics of LY2801653 in the S114
xenograft model; as well as the antitumor growth activity in
xenograft (U-87MG, KP4, H441, MKN45, H1993, HT-29,
and MV4-11) and in orthotopic (H1299) models. For
details, see the Supplementary Method section.

Multiplexed immunofluorescence tumor tissue imaging

U-87MG xenograft tumors were excised from mice after
28 days of dosing and placed into Zinc-Tris fixative (BD
Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), stained and quantified as previ-
ously described [16]. For the apoptotic and proliferative
markers, slides were stained with a combination of Hoechst
33324 (Invitrogen), rat anti-mouse CD31 (Pharmingen) /anti-
rat Alexa-488 (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-Ki67 (NeoMarkers)/
anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen), and TUNEL-TMR red
(Roche). For the angiogenesis markers, slides were stained
with a combination of Hoechst 33324, rat anti-mouse CD31/

anti-rat Alexa-488, rabbit anti-glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)
(Chemicon) /anti-rabbit Alexa 647, and mouse anti-Smooth
Muscle Actin/Cy3 (Sigma).

Results

LY2801653, structure shown in Fig. 1a, was designed to
target the MET kinase. During the development, the kinase
specificity profile of LY2801653 was evaluated against a
panel of 100 kinases and LY2801653 was determined to be
both a MET and MST1R inhibitor, with very weak activity
against KDR. Later, LY2801653 was more broadly screened
against a panel of over 400 kinases and the additional kinase
activities identified are reported at the end of the Results
section.

In vitro MET inhibitory activities

LY2801653 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit biochemical
and cellular functions of MET including cell scattering/migra-
tion and proliferation. Biochemical assays using purified hu-
man MET kinase domain and a synthetic peptide substrate
demonstrated LY2801653 to be a potent, competitive, slow-
off inhibitor of MET tyrosine kinase (Supplementary Fig. S1)
with a dissociation constant (Ki) of 2 nM, a pharmacodynamic
−1 and a half-life (t1/2) of
residence time (Koff) of 0.00132 min
525 min. The crystal structure of MET bound to LY2801653
was determined to 1.8 Å (Fig. 1b) and demonstrated
that
the inhibitor bound MET is in an inactive form
with the activation loop DFG motif adopting a DFG-out
conformation indicating that LY2801653 is a type II
kinase inhibitor [17, 18].

The mean IC50 value (n06 determinations) of LY2801653
for inhibition of MET auto-phosphorylation in HGF-
stimulated H460 cells was 35.2±6.9 nM and the IC50 for
MET auto-phosphorylation in S114 cells was 59.2 nM. The
activity of LY2801653 was also evaluated in BaF3 cells stably
expressing 1 of 13 different MET-activating mutations
(Table 1). Transfection with the MET variants conferred
growth-factor independence and treatment with LY2801653
inhibited growth of these MET variant clones with an IC50
ranging from 3-fold more potent (V1092I) to approximately
6-fold less potent (L1195V) compared with the growth
inhibition of cells with the MET wild-type sequence.

In vitro, LY2801653 potently blocked HGF-induced
DU-145 cell scattering (Fig. 2). Among the untreated
controls, approximately 300 colonies were detected.
With HGF treatment scattering was induced, and the
number of colonies detected was reduced to approxi-
mately 90. LY2801653,
in the concentration range of
0.01–10 μM, completely blocked the HGF-induced
scattering.

In vivo MET target inhibition study in S114 xenograft
model

Target inhibition studies to assess activity of LY2801653
were undertaken in S114 xenograft tumors created through
subcutaneous implantation of S114 cells, a murine cell line
engineered to express both human MET and HGF [13].
MET phosphorylation was inhibited by 98 % 2 h post-
treatment with a single 50-mg/kg dose. Dose response stud-
ies were then performed at this same time point to further
assess potency. LY2801653 treatment inhibited MET phos-
phorylation with a composite TED50 (50 % target inhibition
dose) of 1.2 mg/kg and a composite TED90 (90 % target
inhibition dose) of 7.4 mg/kg (Fig. 3a). The corresponding
TEC50 (the concentration that inhibited 50 % MET phos-
phorylation) was 0.2 μM, whereas the TEC90 (the concen-
tration that inhibited 90 % MET phosphorylation) was 2 μM
(Fig. 3b). A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relation-
ship was observed in these studies. Subsequently, a dose
of 12 mg/kg (TED95) was used in a 24-h time course study
to examine the duration of action. Ninety-five percent inhi-
bition of p-MET occurred at 2 h and was maintained up to
8 h (data not shown). By 16 h, no p-MET inhibition was
observed in tumors. Among the species studied, LY2801653
has the shortest elimination half life in mice of 2.9 h, com-
pared with 14.3 h in non-human primate (data not shown).

Anti-tumor activity in MET-dependent mouse xenograft
models

MET amplification status by FISH analysis of U-87MG,
H441, and MKN45 cells is shown in Fig. 4a. U-87MG
and KP4 cells (Fig. 4b and c, respectively) were selected
for representation of MET pathway activation via autocrine
signaling. Two additional lines were selected to explore
ligand-independent MET over-expression either in the pres-
ence (MKN45 cells; Fig. 4d) or low MET gene amplifica-
tion (H441 cells; Fig. 4e). Whereas neither MKN45 nor
H441 cells express detectable HGF, both U-87MG and
KP4 cells express HGF with the highest levels being found
in the latter (KP4: 4.7 ng/106 cells/24 h; U-87MG: 0.13 ng/
106 cells/24 h). At doses of 4 and 12 mg/kg, similar levels of
anti-tumor growth activity were observed with once or twice
daily dosing of LY2801653 for the U-87MG, and H441
xenograft models.

Two non-continuous dosing regimens were also explored
in the U-87MG and H441 xenograft models. The U-87MG
study (Fig. 4b-2) evaluated the 9/5 schedule for 2 cycles and
the 5/2 schedule for 4 cycles. The H441 study (Fig. 4e)
evaluated the 9/5 schedule for 3 cycles and the 5/2 schedule
for 6 cycles. Results indicated that when dosed at 12 mg/kg
(around TED95), the anti-tumor growth effect in the two
non-continuous dosing regimens was similar to that in the

Fig. 3 Dose dependent inhibition of p-MET by LY2801653 in S114
tumors (a), and pharmacokinetic analysis of the dose response study
(b). Animals (n08 per dose group) were treated with LY2801653.

Phospho-MET level in tumors was determined by MSD ELISA and
compared with that in the vehicle treated group. Data from 4 studies
were used

twice-daily uninterrupted dosing groups. The tumor growth
delay lasted for at least a week after discontinuing dosing.
When the dose was lowered to 3 mg/kg, the 9/5 schedule
displayed better anti-tumor growth effect than the 5/2 schedule
in U-87MG xenograft tumor models (Fig. 4b-2).

Vessel normalization and anti-apoptotic/anti-proliferative
effect

Multiplexed tissue imaging was performed on U-87MG
xenograft tumors treated with vehicle (Figs. 5a–c) or
LY2801653 treatment of 1.3 mg/kg (Figs. 5d–f) and
12 mg/kg (Figs. 5g–i). Qualitatively, U-87MG xenografts
from vehicle-treated animals were well vascularized, with
focalized areas of hypoxia and necrosis. Tumors had a
tortuous network of vessels consisting of extensive neo-
angiogenic vascular sprouts and mature vessels (CD31-
labeled cells) that were poorly covered by pericytes and
most vehicle-treated tumors had clearly demarcated hypoxic
areas (marked by GLUT1 staining) located some distance
from perfused vessels as well as necrotic areas spaced more
distal from vessels. Low-dose (1.3 mg/kg once daily×
28 days) LY2801653 did not result in qualitative differences
in any angiogenesis parameters, but did lead to a quantita-
tive increase in vessel area (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
contrast, treatment once daily with 12 mg/kg LY2801653
appeared to modulate angiogenesis as evident by a decrease
in GLUT1 expression, an increase in pericyte coverage of
vessels, and a qualitative difference in vessel phenotype.
Specifically, vessels in tumors from the 12 mg/kg group,
when compared with vehicle-treated tumors, were of smaller
caliber, less tortuous, highly pericyte-covered, and lacked

staining for hypoxia (GLUT-1) in surrounding tumor cells
(Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S2) suggesting adequate regional
perfusion. Vehicle-treated tumors had proliferating tumor cells
in close proximity to the vasculature, but also frequently
displayed one or more large areas of necrosis that were
avascular. Treatment with 1.3 mg/kg LY2801653 showed a
trend of reducing the area of apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S2), while treatment with 12 mg/kg LY2801653
significantly reduced apoptotic area. Focalized areas of
necrosis/apoptosis were absent in this treatment group,
and tumor cells were less densely packed and had lower
intensity of Hoechst staining (mean nuclear intensity),
which was consistent with a decreased proliferative
potential.

Kinase specificity profile for LY2801653

Discussion

These in vitro studies demonstrated that, in addition to being
a MET inhibitor, LY2801653 also has potent activity against
MST1R, the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases
(AXL, MERTK, and TYRO3), ROS1, PDGFRA, FLT3,
TEK, DDR1/2 and MKNK1/2 (Table 2). A dendrogram of
the in vitro cell-based activity of LY2801653 with IC50 less
than 200 nM is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Findings from subsequent testing of LY2801653 in xe-
nograft or orthotopic models selected based on their depen-
dence on MST1R (H1993, HT-29), FLT3 (MV4-11), and
AXL (H1299) were consistent with the anti-growth activity
of LY2801653 in the presence of these targets (Figs. 4f, and
g and Supplementary Figs. S4A-C). NSCLC-derived H1993
xenograft tumors have previously been shown to have high
levels of pMST1R due to transactivation by highly ampli-
fied MET [7]. The HT-29 colon xenograft tumors not only
express MET, but also express a constitutively activated
splice variant of MST1R, p160MST1R [19]. Growth of
MV4-11 xenograft tumors, an acute myeloid leukemia cell
line is driven by a FLT3-activating mutation [20], and in
vitro anti-proliferative activity of LY2801653 for MV4-11
cells was determined to have an IC50 of 4 nM. Lastly, the
NSCLC H1299 xenograft tumors over-express AXL and its
ligand Gas6.

MET inhibitory activity

The normal physiologic regulation of HGF and MET sig-
naling found in development and organogenesis is prone to
dysregulation in cancer and may contribute to invasion and
metastasis [1, 18]. For these reasons, LY2801653 was de-
veloped through a strategy of targeting the MET receptor,
and data presented here demonstrate that LY2801653 is a
potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of the MET receptor tyro-
sine kinase, which is further capable of inhibiting MET-
dependent tumor cell proliferation and migration/scattering.
In addition, LY2801653 was able to induce vessel normal-
ization in xenograft tumors. Whereas MET signaling is
involved in angiogenesis, this latter effect of LY2801653
may not be exclusively due to MET inhibition. Indeed,
inhibition of angiogenesis by LY2801653 may include con-
tributions from among the limited range of other targets that
it inhibits, such as TEK and AXL, that are involved in
modulating angiogenesis.

In vitro biochemical measurements showed LY2801653
to be a potent inhibitor of MET with a 2 nM Ki, this activity
was confirmed in cell-based assessments,
in which
LY2801653 had an IC50 for inhibition of MET phosphory-
lation of 35.2–59.2 nM. The S114 cell line is an engineered

Supplementary Method section for each

mouse cell line expressing both human MET and HGF. In
mice implanted subcutaneously with S114 tumorigenic
cells, LY2801653 given orally at 12 mg/kg resulted in
95 % inhibition of MET phosphorylation in the tumors for
up to 8 h. With elimination t1/2 being the shortest in mice of
2.9 h (e.g. compared to 14.3 h in non-primate), but with the
kinase active site occupancy t1/2 of approximately 8.5 h,
LY2801653 can be dosed orally twice a day in mouse tumor
model studies.

The crystal structure of MET bound with LY2801653
indicates that LY2801653 is a type II inhibitor and illustrates
that the mechanism of inhibition is through the stabilization
of the inactive ‘DFG-out’ conformation [17, 18]. This bind-
ing mode often leads to a long dissociation time constant, a
feature that was experimentally confirmed by the observa-
tion that LY2801653 has a slow-off rate with an active site
occupancy t1/2 of approximately 8.5 h.

Type-II kinase inhibitors are typically more tolerant of
mutations in the kinase domain than type-I inhibitors [17].
For LY2801653, this feature was experimentally confirmed,
and the molecule does retain inhibitory activity with a

variety of MET-activating point mutations. Of the 13 point
mutations examined, 12 are within the kinase domain. The
exception, S1040P, is in the juxtamembrane domain. The
MET crystal structure with bound LY2801653 provides a
basis to interpret the impact of these mutations on the IC50
of LY2801653. The 2 mutants causing the greatest increases
in IC50 (L1195V and M1131T) are located at the hydropho-
bic binding site of the inhibitor where changing from a
hydrophobic side chain to a polar one, or reducing the size
of hydrophobic side chain, is expected to weaken the inhib-
itor binding. The 2 mutants (D1228N, M1250T) with the
next largest increases in IC50 bear mutations in the activa-
tion loop. This region is distal from the inhibitor. One of the
mutations (D1228N) was not observed in the structure due
to loop disorder. Thus the impact of the mutation is not
through direct interaction with the inhibitor. One hypothesis
for the increased IC50 is that these activating mutations
stabilize the active conformation of the activation loop
(DFG-in conformation), therefore reducing the potency of
the inhibitor. The 2 mutations with noticeable decreases in
IC50 (V1092I, V1220I) are located near the inhibitor. Both
mutations slightly increase the bulk of the hydrophobic side
chain, likely leading to stronger Van der Waals and/or hy-
drophobic interactions with the inhibitor.

Activating mutations of MET have been reported in
sporadic and inherited papillary renal carcinomas, hepato-
cellular carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcino-
mas (HNSCC) and other neoplasms [21]. The majority of
these mutations are kinase domain mutations with homolo-
gy to cancer-inducing mutations in other receptor tyrosine
kinases such as EGFR. In HNSCC, cells harboring multiple
kinase domain mutations have been observed and are pos-
tulated to be selected during metastatic spread [22]. The 13
MET mutations evaluated here represent approximately half
of the kinase domain mutations currently reported in the
literature [23]. The LY2801653-binding configuration to
MET appears to contribute 2 clinically intriguing features;
specifically, the potential ability to retain potency versus a
spectrum of mutations and the ability to sustain target inhi-
bition due to its slow off-rate.

Because the HGF/MET pathway has also been shown to
be involved in cancer cell survival and growth, LY2801653
was evaluated for its ability to inhibit cell growth against a
panel of MET expressing tumor cell lines. LY2801653
showed several-fold more potent anti-proliferative activity
against tumor cell lines with high MET gene amplification
(MKN45, Hs746T, H1993) than the cell
lines without
MET amplification (U-87MG, KATO III). These potency
differences were less evident in the in vivo evaluation in
xenograft models.

The in vivo effects in xenograft mouse models observed
for LY2801653 were otherwise consistent with the in vitro
data. LY2801653 treatment demonstrated significant anti-

842

Invest New Drugs (2013) 31:833–844

tumor growth effect in two MET autocrine models (U-
87MG, KP4), a model with very high MET gene amplifica-
tion (MKN45), and a model with MET low MET amplifi-
cation, but over-expression, (H441). Similar tumor growth
inhibition effect was observed following LY2801653 dosing
of 4 to 12 mg/kg either once or twice a day. In the U-87MG
and H441 models, similar anti-tumor effects were seen with
interrupted dosing on a 9/5 or 5/2 schedule. Whereas the
mechanism for maintaining tumor growth suppression with
the non-continuous dosing schedules is unclear, it may be
related to the observed slow off-rate of LY2801653 released
from the ATP-binding site of the kinase target.

Kinase selectivity profile

Whereas type-II inhibitors are often characterized by a
broad spectrum of kinase activity, LY2801653 retains a
limited repertoire of engagement. The selectivity profile
was examined through biochemical screening against 442
kinases, followed by confirmation with cell-based activity
assays. LY2801653 was found to have potent activity
against 11 additional kinases besides MET. A dendrogram
shows that the 11 kinases are clustered in 3 regions, 2 of
them in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) families and 1
(MKNK1/2) in the CAMK family (calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinases). Because LY2801653 does not
have significant activity against ALK and LTK, it is some-
what surprising to find potent activity against ROS1, which
is in the member of the ALK/LTK family. The x-ray crystal
structure data may offer some insight. The inactive form of
the ALK structure has been shown to be distinct from the
typical features, such as the DFG-out conformation, ob-
served in other RTKs [24]. Instead, it appears that the
DFG-in conformation is more stable in the inactive form
of ALK, explaining the lack of inhibition by LY2801653.
As MKNK1/2 are inhibited by LY2801653 despite these
being serine/threonine kinases rather than tyrosine kinases,
this inhibition is likely due to the inactive form of MKNK1/
2 adopting a DFG-out (DFD in MKNK1/2) conformation,
stabilized in part by the replacement of Asp (D) for Gly (G)
in the canonical DFG motif [25, 26].

LY2801653 is an inhibitor of MET and MST1R (Table 2)
in vitro and demonstrates tumor activity in 2 xenograft
models (H1993, HT29) that co-express MET and MST1R.
Tumor cells such as H1993 that have high levels of MET
gene amplification have been shown to cross-activate
MST1R [7]. The ability to potently block both MET and
MST1R pathway signaling may be advantageous in treating
tumors with this phenotype.

Some of the other kinase targets of LY2801653 presented
in Table 2 were also examined further in in vivo models.
The potent in vitro anti-proliferative activity (IC5004 nM)
and in vivo anti-tumor growth activity of LY2801653 with

the MV4-11 tumor cells may be explained by its inhibitory
activity against FLT3 as this tumor cell line bears a FLT3-
activating mutation [20]. The in vivo anti-tumor growth
activity of LY2801653 against AXL was demonstrated in a
murine orthotopic model of NSCLC (H1299) with AXL
over-expression. MET has been reported to be capable of
transactivating AXL and PDGFRA in vitro in tumor cells
[8]. In human bladder cancer, co-expression of these RTKs
was associated with poor patient survival, and over-
expression of MET/AXL/PDGFRA was shown to correlate
with poor survival, and contributed to the progression of
human bladder cancer [8]. Up-regulation of AXL was
reported recently to be a resistance mechanism to EGFR
targeted therapy [27].

MKNK1/2 are activated by ERK or p38 [28], leading to
the phosphorylation of several substrates including eIF4E
and Sprouty2, thereby enhancing tumorigenesis [29]. An
increase in Sprouty-2 protein in tumor cells was associated
with an increase in MET expression and in tumor malignan-
cy, especially in colon cancer cells [28]. LY2801653 treat-
ment produces anti-tumor effect
in multiple murine
xenograft models bearing KRAS-activating mutation as il-
lustrated in H441 NSCLC cells and KP4 pancreatic cells,
and treatment outcomes for such tumors may benefit from
combined MET and MKNK1/2 inhibition.

ROS1 is an orphan RTK that has been reported to be
constitutively activated via gene translocation leading to
formation of fusion proteins in glioblastoma, NSCLC, ovar-
ian cancer and cholangiocarcinoma [30–33]. Over-
expression of DDR1/2 has been reported in multiple tumor
types such as sarcoma [34]. Activating mutations for DDR2
in squamous cell lung cancer were also reported [34, 35]. In
view of the reported transforming activity of constitutively
activated ROS1 kinase with various fusion partners, and the
potent inhibitory activity of LY2801653 for ROS1 and
DDR1/2,
in evaluating
LY2801653 in tumor types bearing ROS1 or DDR1/2
aberrations.

there may be clinical merit

Tumor vessel normalization describes a process whereby a
tortuous, poorly perfused vascular network is converted to one
that consists of directionally-aligned, highly perfused,
pericyte-covered vessels [36]. Treatment of U-87MG tumor-
bearing mice with daily doses of 12 mg/kg LY2801653
resulted in phenotypic events that are hallmarks of vessel
normalization. Whereas the tumors treated with 12 mg/kg
LY2801653 displayed a more functional vasculature, the
tumors themselves had less apoptotic and proliferative
markers compared with vehicle-treated tumors, consistent
with a cytostatic phenotype. As LY2801653 has little or no
inhibitory activity against KDR, the displayed anti-angiogenic
effects in vivo were most probably via a non-VEGFR-
dependent mechanism. The HGF/MET [37], the AXL and
MERTK [38], and the TEK [39] pathways were all reported

Invest New Drugs (2013) 31:833–844

843

to play a role in tumor angiogenesis and were inhibited by
LY2801653.

In summary, we report here a potent type II ATP-
competitive inhibitor of MET, LY2801653, that has in vivo
anti-tumor activities in multiple mouse xenograft models, as
well as anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative/cytostatic ac-
tivities. In addition, this -molecule has potent inhibitory
activity against several other oncogenic proteins, including
MST1R, FLT3, AXL, PDGFRA, ROS1, TEK, DDR1/2 and
MKNK-1/2. Nonclinical testing suggests that LY2801653
may have merits for clinical evaluation in tumors with a
number of MET pathway phenotypic profiles such as over-
expression, activating mutation, and gene amplification.
Furthermore, as MKNK-1/2 is down-stream of the RAS/
MEK/ERK signaling pathway, LY2801653 may have anti-
tumor activity in tumors bearing KRAS-activating muta-
tions in addition to the over-expression of the above men-
tioned RTK targets. These observations have supported the
progression of LY2801653 into clinical testing in an ongoing
phase 1 study (JSBA, NCT01285037).
