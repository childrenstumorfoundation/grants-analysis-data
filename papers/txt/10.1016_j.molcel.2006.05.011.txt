Summary

The G protein-coupled receptor Gpr1 and associated
Ga subunit Gpa2 govern dimorphic transitions in re-
sponse to extracellular nutrients by signaling coordi-
nately with Ras to activate adenylyl cyclase in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gpa2 forms a protein
complex with the kelch Gb mimic subunits Gpb1/2,
and previous studies demonstrate that Gpb1/2 nega-
tively control cAMP-PKA signaling via Gpa2 and an un-
known second target. Here, we deﬁne these targets of
Gpb1/2 as the yeast neuroﬁbromin homologs Ira1 and
Ira2, which function as GTPase activating proteins of
Ras. Gpb1/2 bind to a conserved C-terminal domain
of Ira1/2, and loss of Gpb1/2 results in a destabilization
of Ira1 and Ira2, leading to elevated levels of Ras2-GTP
and unbridled cAMP-PKA signaling. Because the
Gpb1/2 binding domain on Ira1/2 is conserved in the
human neuroﬁbromin protein, an analogous signaling
network may contribute to the neoplastic development
of neuroﬁbromatosis type 1.

Introduction

Molecular switches composed of G protein-coupled re-
ceptors (GPCRs) and associated heterotrimeric G pro-
teins transduce extracellular stimuli to intracellular sig-
naling molecules,
including the ubiquitous second
messenger cAMP. Canonical heterotrimeric G proteins
consist of a, b, and g subunits. Ligand binding induces
conformational changes in the receptor, stimulating
GDP to GTP exchange on the associated Ga subunits,
leading to dissociation of the receptor-Ga subunit com-
plex and release of the Gbg dimer. Liberated Ga, Gbg, or
both signal via downstream effectors. Signal transduc-
tion is attenuated by either intrinsic or RGS-stimulated
GTP hydrolysis followed by reassociation of Ga-GDP
with the Gbg dimer (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003; Dohlman
et al., 1991; Ross and Wilkie, 2000).

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae de-
ploys two distinct GPCR-G protein signaling modules
to sense pheromones and nutrients, respectively (Hara-
shima and Heitman, 2004). One is haploid and mating-
type speciﬁc and involves the pheromone receptors
Ste2/3 coupled to the Ga subunit Gpa1 in a canonical

heterotrimeric complex with the Gbg subunits Ste4/18.
In response to pheromone, the Ste4/18 dimer dissoci-
ates from Gpa1 and activates the pheromone-respon-
sive MAP kinase pathway to enable mating.

The second yeast GPCR signaling cascade involves
the GPCR Gpr1, which is expressed in both haploid
and diploid cells and activates the associated Ga sub-
unit Gpa2 in response to glucose and structurally related
sugars (Lemaire et al., 2004; Lorenz et al., 2000; Xue
et al., 1998; Yun et al., 1998). Activated Gpa2 stimulates
cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase and engages the
PKA signaling pathway (Colombo et al., 1998; Lorenz
and Heitman, 1997). In contrast to canonical Ga sub-
units, Gpa2 is unable to form a heterotrimeric G protein
with the known Gbg subunits Ste4/18. Instead, Gpa2 as-
sociates with two kelch proteins, Gpb1 and Gpb2, which
are functionally redundant, share w35% sequence iden-
tity, and each contain seven kelch repeat motifs. In
a striking example of convergent evolution, both the
WD-40 repeat-based Gb subunits and the kelch repeat
enzyme galactose oxidase are known to fold into seven
bladed b propeller structures that are essentially super-
imposable (Harashima and Heitman, 2004).

Mutants lacking the Gpr1 receptor or the coupled
Gpa2 subunit are defective in glucose-induced cAMP
production and ﬁlamentous growth, whereas gpb1,2
double mutants exhibit increased PKA phenotypes, in-
cluding enhanced ﬁlamentous growth, sensitivity to ni-
trogen starvation and heat shock, and impaired glyco-
gen accumulation and sporulation (Batlle et al., 2003;
Harashima and Heitman, 2002). Introduction of gpa2
mutations only partially attenuates these gpb1,2 mutant
phenotypes, providing evidence that Gpb1/2 negatively
regulate cAMP signaling by inhibiting Gpa2 and an as
yet unidentiﬁed second target. Mutation of the gene en-
coding one of the three PKA catalytic subunits, Tpk2,
largely suppresses the elevated PKA phenotypes of
gpb1,2 mutants, indicating that this second target may
be a component of the cAMP signaling pathway itself
(Harashima and Heitman, 2002). Our recent studies pro-
vide evidence that Gpb1/2 are recruited to and function
at the plasma membrane in a Gpa2-dependent manner,
suggesting that the unidentiﬁed second target may be
membrane-associated (Harashima and Heitman, 2005).
In S. cerevisiae, the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade is
essential for cell viability. Loss of either adenylyl cyclase
(Cyr1) or all three PKA catalytic subunits (Tpk1,2,3) is le-
thal (Toda et al., 1988; Toda et al., 1987b). On the other
hand, elevated PKA activity as a consequence of muta-
tions in the PKA regulatory subunit Bcy1 results in
a growth defect (Toda et al., 1987a). Therefore, cAMP
signaling must be strictly controlled in response to ex-
tracellular cues. Two distinct Gpr1-Gpa2 and Ras-medi-
ated pathways converge on Cyr1. Notably, ras2 mutants
fail to produce cAMP in response to glucose, similar to
gpr1 and gpa2 mutants, and gpr1 ras2 and gpa2 ras2
mutants exhibit a synthetic growth defect, suggesting
that Gpr1-Gpa2 and Ras2 play a shared role in glu-
cose-induced cAMP production (Bhattacharya et al.,
1995; Ku¨ bler et al., 1997; Xue et al., 1998).

S. cerevisiae expresses two Ras proteins: Ras1 and
Ras2 (Powers et al., 1984). Although Ras1 and Ras2
are functionally redundant for cell growth, Ras2 plays
the predominant role in cAMP signaling in response to
glucose. Ras activity is controlled positively by the gua-
nine nucleotide exchange factors Cdc25 and Sdc25
(GEFs) and negatively by the GTPase activating proteins
Ira1 and Ira2 (GAPs) (Crechet et al., 1990; Munder and
Furst, 1992; Tanaka et al., 1990a, 1991). Ras2 is known
to bind to and activate Cyr1, yet how Ras2 regulates
Cyr1 in response to glucose is not understood at a mo-
lecular level (Field et al., 1988; Mintzer and Field, 1994).
Previous studies have implicated Cdc25 in responses
to glucose (Gross et al., 1999; Munder and Kuntzel,
1989; Portillo and Mazon, 1986). On the other hand,
Ira1 has been shown to interact with Cyr1 and may pro-
mote its membrane localization (Mitts et al., 1991). ira1,2
double mutant cells exhibit constitutively elevated Ras2-
GTP levels and are unable to further mount a Ras2-GTP
increase in response to glucose (Colombo et al., 2004).
Therefore, both Cdc25 and Ira1/2 may coordinately acti-
vate Ras2 and adenylyl cyclase in response to glucose.
The RasGAP Ira1/2 proteins are large (w350 kDa) pro-
teins that are conserved from yeast to humans (Tanaka
et al., 1989, 1990b). In humans, the RasGAP activity of
the Ira1/2 homolog neuroﬁbromin is implicated in one
of the most common genetic diseases, neuroﬁbromato-
sis type I (NF1) (Ballester et al., 1990; Cawthon et al.,
1990; Viskochil et al., 1990; Wallace et al., 1990; Xu
et al., 1990a). Although the IRA1, IRA2, and NF1 genes
were cloned more than a decade ago, how the RasGAP
activity of these proteins is controlled is largely un-
known. Here, we identiﬁed the yeast neuroﬁbromin ho-
mologs Ira1/2 as targets of the kelch Gb mimic subunits
Gpb1/2. Gpb1/2 bind to a conserved C-terminal domain,
stabilize Ira1/2, and thereby serve to govern cAMP-PKA
signaling by constraining Ras2-GTP excursions. These
ﬁndings have profound potential implications for our un-
derstanding of NF1 functions in normal cell growth con-
trol and its dysregulation in individuals with NF1.

Results

Kelch Gb Mimic Proteins Act Upstream
of the PKA Pathway
We hypothesized that the second target of the kelch Gb
mimic Gpb1/2 proteins might be either an early or a later
component of the PKA pathway. Here, epistasis analysis
was used to pinpoint the site of Gpb1/2 action. In models
in which Gpb1/2 function downstream of Cyr1, gpb1,2
mutations would be predicted to rescue the growth
defect of ras2 gpa2 double mutant cells. To test this
hypothesis, two diploid mutants (gpa2/gpa2 ras2/RAS2
and gpb1,2/gpb1,2 gpa2/GPA2 ras2/ras2) were con-
structed, sporulated, and dissected. As shown in Fig-
ure 1A, gpb1,2 ras2 gpa2 cells were as growth impaired
as ras2 gpa2 cells, providing evidence that Gpb1/2
instead act early in the pathway via Cyr1 or one of its
regulatory elements such as Ras1/2, Cdc25, or Ira1/2.

To examine genetic interactions between gpb1,2 and
ras2 mutations, the RAS2 gene was deleted in gpb1,2
cells and the resulting gpb1,2 ras2 cells were tested
for ﬁlamentous growth, FLO11 expression, sensitivity
to nitrogen starvation, and glycogen accumulation (Fig-

ures 1B–1F). Consistent with our previous ﬁndings,
gpb1,2 cells exhibited elevated pseudohyphal and inva-
sive growth, increased FLO11 expression, sensitivity to
nitrogen starvation, and reduced glycogen accumula-
tion.
Introduction of a gpa2 mutation partially sup-
pressed these gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes (Figure 1
and Harashima and Heitman [2002]). On the other
hand, introduction of a ras2 mutation more completely
suppressed these gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes. Steady-
state and glucose-induced cAMP levels were also deter-
mined. As shown previously (Harashima and Heitman,
2002), an increased basal level of cAMP was observed
in gpb1,2 cells, and this elevated cAMP level was re-
stored to the wild-type level by a ras2 mutation (Fig-
ure 1G). Introduction of a ras1 mutation was unable to
suppress any of the gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes (data
not shown). Taken together, these genetic studies sup-
port the hypothesis that Gpb1/2 act directly on Ras2 or
one of its regulators such as the RasGEF Cdc25 or the
RasGAP Ira1/2 proteins.

RasGAP Proteins Ira1/2 Interact with the Kelch Gb
Mimic Subunits Gpb1/2
Possible targets of Gpb1/2 were identiﬁed by mass
spectrometry analysis of the Gpb1/2 native protein com-
plex. For this purpose, the FLAG epitope tag was fused
to the carboxy terminus of Gpb1 and to the amino termi-
nus of Gpb2. These FLAG-Gpb1/2 proteins were ex-
pressed from an attenuated ADH1 promoter on a 2 mm
plasmid. Expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins re-
stored wild-type ﬁlamentous growth of the gpb1,2 dou-
ble mutant strain, indicating that both fusion proteins are
functional (data not shown). Because endogenous Gpa2
and Gpb1/2 may compete for Gpb1/2 with other targets,
the FLAG-Gpb1/2 proteins were expressed in gpa2
gpb1,2 triple mutant cells. Crude cellular extracts were
prepared, and Gpb1/2 and interacting proteins were
coimmunoprecipitated by using an anti-FLAG afﬁnity
matrix. The native protein complexes were eluted with
FLAG peptide, and the eluted proteins were analyzed
by mass spectrometry (see Experimental Procedures).
This analysis revealed a number of candidate Gpb1/2-
interacting proteins. Importantly, the list of Gpb2-inter-
acting proteins included Ira1 and Ira2, and no other
components of the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade (in-
cluding Cdc25, Ras1/2, Cyr1, Pde1/2, Bcy1, Tpk1/2/3,
Flo8, or Sﬂ1) were identiﬁed (data not shown). Because
Gpb1 and Gpb2, and also Ira1 and Ira2, represent par-
tially redundant protein pairs, we hypothesized that
Gpb1 and Gpb2 might bind to both Ira1 and Ira2. To ad-
dress this possibility, Gpb1 was N-terminally tagged and
expressed, and Gpb1/2-Ira1/2 interactions were exam-
ined in cells that also expressed a functional version of
the Ira1 or Ira2 protein fused with three copies of the
hemagglutinin epitope tag (3HA) (Figure 2). Importantly,
this coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Gpb1
and Gpb2 both interact with both Ira1 and Ira2 (Figures
2A and 2B).

Gpb1/2 contain a unique N-terminal domain and a C-
terminal domain containing seven kelch repeats. Our
previous studies revealed that the kelch domains of
Gpb2 bind to Gpa2 but the unique N-terminal domain
does not (Harashima and Heitman, 2002). To examine
which domain(s)
the Gpb1/2-Ira1/2

is required for

interaction, the FLAG tag was fused to either the N termi-
nus of the N-terminal unique domain (FLAG-Gpb2N) or to
the C-terminal kelch domain (FLAG-Gpb2C), and the
resulting fusion proteins and FLAG-Gpb2 were coex-
pressed with the Ira1-3HA protein in vivo (Figure 2C). In
contrast to the Gpa2-Gpb1/2 interaction, neither the
Gpb2 N-terminal nor the C-terminal domain alone was
sufﬁcient to bind to Ira1. Therefore, both Gpb2 domains
are required for interaction with Ira1. We note that the
unique N-terminal and the C-terminal kelch domains
are both essential for Gpb1/2 function in vivo (Harashima
and Heitman, 2002).

Because the gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes were sup-
pressed by ras2 mutations and Gpb1/2 bind to the Ras-
GAP proteins Ira1/2, Gpb1/2 could associate with Ira1/2
and function via Ras2. However, Gpb1/2 interacted with
Ira1/2 in the absence of Ras2 as strongly as in the pres-
ence of Ras2 (Figure 2D). Therefore, Ras2 is dispensable
for the Gpb1/2-Ira1/2 interactions, and Gpb1/2 may con-
trol Ras activity through direct interaction with Ira1/2.

Gpb1/2 Are Genetically Implicated in Both
Gpa2- and Ras-Mediated Signaling
ras2 mutants are defective in ﬁlamentous growth,
whereas wild-type cells expressing a dominant active

RAS2G19V allele that lacks intrinsic GTPase activity ex-
hibit elevated ﬁlamentous growth. Consistent with these
ﬁndings, cells lacking Ira1, Ira2, or both Ira1 and Ira2 were
also hyperﬁlamentous (Figure 3A). Importantly, ira1,2
cells expressing Gpb1/2 and ira1,2 gpb1,2 quadruple
mutant cells lacking Gpb1/2 were morphologically indis-
tinguishable from each other. These ﬁndings support
models in which the hyperﬁlamentous phenotype con-
ferred by the gpb1,2 mutations may be exerted via Ira1/2.
Expression of the dominant active GPA2Q300L and
RAS2G19V alleles dramatically enhances ﬁlamentous
growth of wild-type cells (Figure 3B). In contrast, little
if any further effect was observed when these dominant
active mutant alleles were expressed in the hyperﬁla-
mentous gpb1,2 double mutant, supporting models in
which Gpa2 and Ras2 are activated by the gpb1,2 muta-
tions and Gpb1/2 function to negatively control the ac-
tivity of both (Figure 3B).

If Gpb1/2 regulate Ira1/2, and the hyperﬁlamentous
phenotype of the gpb1,2 mutant is due to reduced
Ira1/2 RasGAP activity,
increased expression of the
IRA2 gene should suppress the gpb1,2 mutant pheno-
type. In fact, overexpression of the IRA2 gene attenu-
ated pseudohyphal differentiation of the gpb1,2 mutant
(Figure 3C).

with RasGAP Ira1/2

(A and B) Ira1 (A) and Ira2 (B) physically bind
to Gpb1/2 in vivo. The N-terminally FLAG-
tagged Gpb1 (pTH111) and Gpb2 (pTH88)
proteins were expressed in yeast cells that
also express C-terminally 3HA-tagged Ira1
or Ira2 and immunoprecipitated.
(C) Gpb2 requires both the unique N-terminal
and the C-terminal kelch domains to interact
with Ira1. The N-terminally FLAG-tagged
Gpb2 N-terminal region (FLAG-Gpb2N), C-
terminal kelch domains (FLAG-Gpb2C), or
full-length Gpb2 (FLAG-Gpb2) was coex-
pressed with the Ira1-3HA protein in vivo. Po-
sitions of molecular marker (128, 85, 41.7, and
32.1 k) are indicated to the right of the panel.
(D) Ras2 is dispensable for the Gpb2-Ira1 in-
teraction. Gpb2-Ira1 interactions were exam-
ined in the presence and absence of Ras2 by
using cells that express FLAG-Gpb2.
Note that the ﬁrst lane in the Co-IP panels of
(A) and (B) was spliced to eliminate a space
and that the data in each panel are directly
comparable.
In (A)–(D), protein complexes were captured
on anti-FLAG afﬁnity gel and detected with
anti-FLAG or anti-HA. Input levels of Ira1/2
were captured on anti-HA agurose beads,
eluted, and analyzed by Western blot using
anti-HA antibody (see the Experimental Pro-
cedures for details).

Consistently, neither loss of the IRA1/2 genes nor in-
troduction of the RAS2G19V gene exaggerated mutant
phenotypes (including hyperinvasion, nitrogen starva-
tion sensitivity, and decreased glycogen) associated
with an elevated PKA activity in gpb1,2 cells (Figures
3D–3F). On the other hand, overproduction of Ira2 was
able to alleviate these gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes (Fig-
ures 3D–3F). In addition, the increased basal and glu-
cose-induced cAMP levels in gpb1,2 cells were signiﬁ-
cantly attenuated by Ira2 overproduction (Figure 3G).

In summary, these genetic data provide evidence that

Gpb1/2 negatively control cAMP signaling via Ira1/2.

Gpb1/2 Control Ira1/2 RasGAP Activity
Biochemical and genetic data indicate that Ira1/2 repre-
sent secondary targets of Gpb1/2 and that Gpb1/2 func-
tion to enhance Ira1/2 activity. To investigate this at
a mechanistic level, we quantiﬁed Ras2-GTP levels by
measuring Ras2 protein binding to the Raf1 kinase that
speciﬁcally interacts with Ras-GTP (Colombo et al.,
2004). A low copy number plasmid carrying the wild-
type RAS2 or dominant active RAS2G19V gene was intro-
duced into wild-type, gpb1,2, ira1, ira2, and ira1,2 cells.
Transformants were grown in synthetic medium to mid-
logarithmic growth phase, and crude cell extracts were
prepared to assess the steady state levels of Ras2-GTP.
As shown previously, the Ras-GTP level was in-
creased w5-fold in ira1 and ira2 cells, (Figure 4A and
Tanaka et al. [1990a]). Similarly, gpb1,2 cells also ex-
hibited an w5 fold increase in Ras2-GTP levels, indica-
tive of reduced RasGAP activity (Figure 4A). The Ras-GTP
level in ira1,2 cells was further increased and compara-
ble to that in wild-type and gpb1,2 cells expressing
the RAS2G19V gene, in which an w25-fold increase in

Ras-GTP was observed (Figure 4A). These observations
are in accord with the previous ﬁnding documenting
that Ras2-GTP levels were indistinguishable between
wild-type and ira1,2 cells when the RAS2G19V gene
was expressed (Tanaka et al., 1990a). In summary, loss
of Gpb1/2 results in an elevation of Ras2-GTP, possibly
by reducing, but not eliminating, the RasGAP activity of
Ira1/2.

Gpb1/2 Control Protein Levels of Ira1/2
To elucidate how Gpb1/2 control Ira1/2 RasGAP activity,
we investigated the levels of the Ira1/2 proteins as well
as Ira1/2-Ras2 interactions in the presence and absence
of Gpb1/2. To examine protein levels, the functional
Ira1/2-3HA proteins were expressed. Neither Ira1 nor
Ira2 was detectable by Western blot analysis using
crude cell extracts because of low expression levels
(data not shown). The Ira1/2-3HA proteins were there-
fore enriched by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA-
conjugated agarose beads, which also enabled an ex-
amination of the levels of the Ras2 protein bound to
the Ira1/2-3HA afﬁnity captured proteins (Figure 4B).

As shown in Figure 4B, loss of Gpb1/2 resulted in
a marked decrease in the levels of both Ira1 and Ira2
and a concomitant loss of Ras2 as an Ira1/2-interacting
protein. Reintroduction of the GPB1 and GPB2 genes
complemented this defect and restored the levels of
Ira1/2 to the wild-type levels, indicating that Gpb1/2
govern the stability of Ira1/2.

To conﬁrm this model, protein stability of Ira1/2 was
examined in the presence and absence of Gpb1/2 by a
pulse-chase analysis (Figures 4C and 4D). In wild-type
cells, the Ira1/2 and Fpr1 proteins were stable over
time, and the half life (t1/2) of these proteins was more

(A) Isogenic diploid strains indicated were assayed for pseudohyphal growth.
(B) The dominant active GPA2Q300L and RAS2G19V alleles were introduced into diploid wild-type and gpb1,2 cells and tested for ﬁlamentous

than 4 hr (t1/2 > 4 hr, Figures 4C and 4D and data not
shown). Similarly, the Fpr1 protein in gpb1,2 cells was
as stable as in wild-type cells (Figures 4C and 4D and
data not shown). However, levels of the Ira1/2 proteins
decreased rapidly, and the half-life of Ira1 and Ira2 was
reduced to w30 and 25 min, respectively (Figures 4C
and 4D). Therefore, we conclude that Gpb1/2 bind to
and stabilize Ira1/2 and that loss of Gpb1/2 leads to re-
duced Ira1/2 protein levels.

Gpb1/2 Stabilize Ira1/2 by Binding
to a C-Terminal Domain
To establish how Gpb1/2 control stability of the Ira1/2
proteins, the Gpb1/2 binding domain on Ira1/2 was iden-
tiﬁed. For this purpose, deletions were created in the en-
dogenous Ira1 C terminus by inserting the 3HA epitope
and expressing these deletion derivatives in an other-
wise wild-type background (Figure 5). Plasmids ex-
pressing the FLAG-Gpb1/2 proteins were then intro-
duced into the resulting Ira1 deletion mutant cells, and
Gpb1/2-Ira1 interactions were examined by FLAG-me-
diated coimmunoprecipitation (Figures 5A and 5B).

By Western blot analysis, the level of the C-terminally
truncated 1–2925 aa Ira1 protein was signiﬁcantly re-
duced and the shorter 1–2714 aa and 1–2432 aa Ira1 pro-
teins were undetectable in this assay (Figure 5A and ‘‘In-
put’’ panel in Figure 5B). Because Gpb1/2 control the
stability of the Ira1/2 proteins, deletion of a Gpb1/2 bind-
ing site should result in a decrease in Ira1/2 protein
levels. Thus, we hypothesized that the Gpb1/2 binding
site might be present in the C-terminal region of Ira1
necessary for Ira1 stability. In fact, Gpb1/2 bound to
the Ira1 deletion protein retaining 1–2925 aa, but not to
the derivative containing only 1–1257 aa (Figure 5A
and ‘‘Co-IP’’ panel in Figure 5B). Furthermore, two N-ter-
minal deletion derivatives that retain amino acid resi-
dues 2433–3092 and 2715–3092 were stably expressed
and both associated with Gpb1/2 (Figure 5C). A C-termi-
nal region spanning 2715–2925 aa of Ira1 also bound to
Gpb1/2 (Figure 5D), and loss of this region resulted in in-
stability of this Ira1 deletion derivative in accord with the
role of Gpb1/2 in Ira1 protein stability (Figure 5A and
data not shown). Taken together, these results reveal
that the Gpb1/2 binding domain (GBD) maps between

(A) The relative increase in Ras2-GTP was examined in haploid cells that express the wild-type or dominant active (G19V) RAS2 gene. Repre-
sentative data are shown in the top panel. Puriﬁed Ras2-GTP from ira1,2 double mutant cells expressing the wild-type Ras2 protein and
wild-type and gpb1,2 mutant cells that express the dominant active Ras2G19V protein was 5-fold diluted prior to Western analysis, as the levels
of Ras2-GTP in these cells were higher than those in the other cells. Levels of Ras-GTP and total cellular Ras protein (‘‘Input’’) were densitometri-
cally quantiﬁed. Ras2-GTP levels were then normalized to ‘‘Input’’ Ras2 levels and shown as a relative level to Ras2-GTP in wild-type cells in the
bottom panel. The values shown in the bottom panel are the means of two or three independent experiments with the standard error of the mean.
(B) The GPB1/2 genes were introduced into wild-type and gpb1,2 cells expressing either IRA1-3HA or IRA2-3HA to examine protein stability of
Ira1/2 and the Ras2-Ira1/2 interactions. ‘‘NT’’ indicates the nontagged, wild-type Ira1, Ira2, or Trp1 protein. Based on densitometric analysis, the
steady-state protein levels of Ira1/2 were reduced in gpb1,2 cells by at least 2- to 10-fold compared to wild-type cells.
(C and D) Protein stability of Ira1/2 was investigated by cycloheximide-chase assay in the presence and absence of Gpb1/2. Levels of Ira1/2-3HA
and Fpr1 were densitometorically quantiﬁed, and the percentage of protein abundance of Ira1/2 and Fpr1 at ‘‘Time 0’’ is shown in the bottom
panel. Note that the ﬁrst and the last lanes in the ‘‘Ras2-GTP’’ and ‘‘Input’’ panels in (A) were spliced to eliminate a space or a lane and that
the data in each panel are directly comparable.

amino acids 2715 and 2925 of Ira1. Signiﬁcantly, this re-
gion is conserved in homologs of Ira1, including the hu-
man neuroﬁbromin protein (see Discussion).

Equivalent deletions were also introduced into Ira2
(Figure S1 available in the Supplemental Data with this
article online). The level of the Ira2 C-terminal deletion
protein retaining 1–2922 aa was reduced, and this Ira2
deletion derivative was still able to interact with Gpb1/2
(Figures S1A and S1B). An Ira2 variant that preserves
1–2702 aa, but not the GBD, was now undetectable
(Figure S1B). These ﬁndings are similar to the equivalent
Ira1 deletion proteins (1–2925 aa and 1–2714 aa) (Fig-

ure 5). Both Gpb1 and Gpb2 bind to Ira2 deletion deriv-
atives retaining amino acids 2703–3079 and 2703–2922
that are homologous to the regions spanning the corre-
sponding amino acids 2715–3092 and 2715–2925 of Ira1
(Figures S1C and S1D). These results provide evidence
that the GBD maps to the corresponding regions of
both Ira1 and Ira2.

shaded in gray. The GAP-related domain (GRD) and the Gpb1/2 binding domain (GBD) are shown as hatched and dark gray rectangles, respec-
tively.
(B) Protein interactions were investigated by using crude cell extracts from cells expressing the 3HA-tagged full-length Ira1 (1–3092 aa) or Ira1
C-terminal deletion variants. Positions of full-length wild-type Ira1 and deletion variants (1–2925 and 1w1257 aa) are indicated to the left of the
panel. Positions at which molecular weight markers (250, 210, and 148 k) migrated are indicated to the right of the panels. The deletion
of 167 amino acids leads to reduced protein levels of Ira1 from 3- to 7-fold in comparison of the full-length Ira1 protein level, and the further
deletion (378 aa) results in undetectable levels (‘‘Input’’). Note that some smaller Ira1-3HA species were also detected via the C-terminal HA
tag, indicating that these are proteolysis products lacking N-terminal regions. This further supports the assignment of the GBD to the C-terminal
region of Ira1.
(C) N-terminal deletion Ira1 variants were tested for interaction with Gpb1/2. Positions of the Ira1 deletion variants (2433–3092 and 2715–3092 aa)
are indicated to the left of the panel.

abolish protein stability, respectively. To test for a phys-
iological relevance of these results, homozygous diploid
cells that express these Ira1 C-terminal deletions
(D2926–3092, D2715–3092, and DGBD) were con-
structed and assessed for pseudohyphal differentiation
(Figure 6A). Haploid cells that carry these Ira1 C-terminal
deletions were also tested for invasive growth, nitrogen
starvation sensitivity, and glycogen accumulation (Fig-
ures 6B–6D). Cells expressing the truncated Ira1 deriva-
tive that contains 1–2925 aa and also includes the GBD
exhibited signiﬁcantly increased ﬁlamentous growth

and sensitivity to nitrogen starvation and decreased gly-
cogen (Figure 6). Cells expressing the shorter Ira1 deriv-
atives that lack the GBD (1–2714 aa or DGBD) were
markedly hyperﬁlamentous and phenotypically indistin-
guishable from gpb1,2 or ira1 null mutant cells, suggest-
ing that these two Ira1 deletion derivatives are nonfunc-
tional (Figure 6). This is consistent with instability of
these deletion proteins (Figure 5). Therefore, the GBD
and the extreme C-terminal region are both involved in
protein stability and physiological functions of the Ira1
protein.

Discussion

Kelch Gpb1/2 Proteins Stabilize the RasGAP
Proteins Ira1/2
The central ﬁnding of our study is the discovery that the
activity of the yeast RasGAP neuroﬁbromin homologs
Ira1/2 is controlled by two components of the GPCR-Ga
signaling module: Gpb1 and Gpb2. Our studies provide
evidence that Gpb1/2 bind to and control the stability of
Ira1/2 and thereby affect intracellular Ras-GTP levels. In
conjunction with their role in binding the Gpa2-GDP
complex and inhibiting receptor-Ga coupling, Gpb1/2
serve as potent molecular brakes to constrain signaling
via the PKA signaling pathway during both vegetative
growth and dimorphic transitions (Figure 7).

Deletion analysis enabled the deﬁnition of two C-ter-
minal domains involved in the protein stability of Ira1/2.
Namely, the Gpb1/2 binding domain (GBD) spanning
2715–2925 aa in Ira1 and the corresponding region in
Ira2 (2703–2922 aa) and the more extreme C-terminal re-
gion of Ira1/2 that is unique to the yeast proteins (Fig-
ure 5 and Figure S1). The two domains have an additive
effect, because the Ira1/2 C-terminally truncated pro-
teins lacking the yeast-speciﬁc domain were still detect-
able, yet deletions eliminating both domains or the GBD
alone resulted in undetectable levels of the Ira1/2 C-ter-
minal deletion variants (1–2714 aa Ira1, Ira1DGBD, and
1–2702 aa Ira2). Consistent with this,
Ira1/2 protein
levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in gpb1,2 cells com-
pared with those in wild-type cells (Figures 4B and 5

and Figure S1). Therefore, two distinct mechanisms ap-
pear to govern the stability of Ira1/2. Importantly, Ira1
was found to be ubiquitinated in a proteomic analysis
of membrane-associated proteins (Hitchcock et al.,
2003). This ﬁnding indicates that Ira1/2 protein stability
might be controlled by a ubiquitin/proteasome-depen-
dent mechanism as is neuroﬁbromin (see below), and
Gbp1/2 could inhibit Ira1/2 ubiquitination or interactions
with the proteasome and thereby stabilize Ira1/2. Fur-
ther studies will be required to elucidate in further detail
the molecular mechanisms by which the yeast neuroﬁ-
bromin homologs Ira1/2 are stabilized. These would
also shed light on how RasGAP activity of neuroﬁbromin
is controlled in response to extracellular stimuli.

Interestingly, in previous studies, a transversion muta-
tion resulting in a premature nonsense codon at the
2700th amino acid was identiﬁed in Ira2, truncating the
penultimate 222 amino acids,
including the Gpb1/2
binding domain, and resulting in a loss of Ira2 function
(Halme et al., 2004). These studies provide complemen-
tary support for our ﬁnding that the C-terminal domain of
Ira1/2 is critical for biological function. Importantly, the
role of the GBD is also likely to be conserved in human
neuroﬁbromin because the GBD is conserved among
the yeast and mammalian neuroﬁbromin homologs.
Therefore, our ﬁndings should shed light on how the
GAP activity of the neuroﬁbromin homologs is con-
trolled and its dysregulation in the ontogeny of NF1.

Ira1 and Ira2 share w45% sequence similarity and are
functionary redundant, yet each may also play speciﬁc

roles in Ras regulation. First, ira1,2 double mutants ex-
hibit more severe phenotypes compared to each single
mutant. For instance, ira1,2 double mutants exhibit an
increased sensitivity to heat shock, enhanced ﬁlamen-
tous growth, and increased Ras-GTP levels compared
to ira1 or ira2 single mutants (Figure 3; [Tanaka et al.,
1990a, 1990b]). Second, overproduction of the IRA2
gene is able to suppress the heat shock sensitivity of
ira1,2 cells, but overexpression of the IRA1 gene does
not (Tanaka et al., 1990b). Similarly, we note that overex-
pression of IRA2 suppresses the gpb1,2 double mutant
phenotype, whereas overexpression of IRA1 does not
(data not shown, Figure 3). Third, ira1 mutations sup-
press the lethality of cdc25 mutations more efﬁciently
than ira2 mutations (Tanaka et al., 1990b). Therefore,
Ira1/2 may be controlled by both common and speciﬁc
regulators. Indeed, Tfs1, which is a member of the phos-
phatidylethanolamine binding protein family and known
as a cytoplasmic inhibitor CPY, speciﬁcally binds to and
inhibits Ira2, although the mechanisms by which Tfs1
controls RasGAP activity of Ira2 remain unclear (Chau-
tard et al., 2004).

Gpb1/2 Link Signaling from the Ga Subunit Gpa2
to Ras
Our studies demonstrate that a central molecular link be-
tween the GPCR Gpr1-Ga Gpa2 signaling module and
Ras is exerted via the RasGAP Ira1/2. Our recent studies
also demonstrate that Gpb1/2 preferentially bind to the
GDP bound form of Gpa2 and Gpb1/2 are recruited to
the plasma membrane in a Gpa2-dependent manner
and function to inhibit coupling between the Gpr1 recep-
tor and Gpa2 (Harashima and Heitman, 2002, 2005). We
hypothesize that the following molecular events tran-
spire when the ligand glucose binds to the Gpr1 receptor
(Figure 7). First, GDP-GTP exchange occurs on Gpa2 and
Gpb1/2 dissociate from Gpa2-GTP. Second, Gpa2-GTP
stimulates cAMP production via adenylyl cyclase and
the liberated Gpb1/2 subunits then interact with and sta-
bilize the Ira1/2 proteins. On the other hand, Ras is also

activated in response to glucose by a Cdc25-mediated
GDP-GTP exchange reaction. The Gpb1/2 bound and
stabilized Ira1/2 proteins now bind to Ras-GTP and stim-
ulate GTP hydrolysis, attenuating Ras-mediated activa-
tion of Cyr1. These mechanisms provide the cell with
an elaborate and balanced regulatory network that con-
strains cAMP signaling within a tightly controlled physi-
ological range. In this model, Gpb1/2 play a dual inhibi-
tory role to inhibit
receptor-Ga coupling and to
extinguish signaling by Ras-GTP via their action to stabi-
lize and thereby promote the RasGAP activity of Ira1/2.
A recent report has suggested that Gpb1/2 might act
late in the PKA pathway to regulate signaling, possibly
via direct actions on the PKA catalytic or regulatory sub-
unit or on a protein phosphatase that impinges on PKA
(Lu and Hirsch, 2005). Although such a model is conceiv-
able, no direct evidence linking Gpb1 or Gpb2 to either
PKA subunits or candidate regulators was presented.
Instead, our genetic and physical evidence presented
here support a model in which Gpb1/2 directly impinge
upon Ira1/2 in the PKA signaling pathway. In addition, si-
multaneous loss of Gpb1/2 was unable to suppress the
growth defect of gpa2 ras2 cells (Figure 1A). However,
given the complex nature of the PKA signaling cascade,
one idea in which these two apparently conﬂicting
models might be reconciled would be to consider that
the signaling cascade might exist as a supramolecular
complex, in which it might be difﬁcult to assign a strictly
linear signaling pathway. Given the size of the Ira1/2 pro-
teins, it would not be surprising if these were to act as
scaffolds for PKA signaling via interactions with Ras,
Gpb1/2, and other signaling components.
In such
a model, Gpb1/2 might exert regulatory roles at multiple
steps in the cascade. Further studies will be required to
elucidate the potent inhibitory action of Gpb1/2 on the
PKA signaling pathway.

A Yeast Model for NF1
NF1 is an autosomal-dominant disorder that occurs in
approximately one in every 3500 newborn infants.

Molecular Cell

Mutations in the NF1 gene result in pleiotropic manifes-
tations that include learning disabilities, small stature,
bony abnormalities, and benign neuroﬁbromas involv-
ing peripheral nerves. In some cases, NF1 patients pres-
ent with malignant tumors involving peripheral nerve
sheath tumors, optic gliomas, or the hematopoietic sys-
tem (Zhu and Parada, 2002).

The human Ira1/2 homolog neuroﬁbromin is a large
protein (w300 kDa) that shares sequence identity with
members of the RasGAP family, including p120GAP,
and Drosophila NF1 (Buchberg et al., 1990; Cawthon
et al., 1990; Marchuk et al., 1991; Wallace et al., 1990;
Xu et al., 1990b). The RasGAP activity of neuroﬁbromin
has a pivotal role in Ras-dependent NF1 development
because expression of the GAP-related domain (GRD)
of neuroﬁbromin can alleviate these NF12/2-deﬁcient
phenotypes (DeClue et al., 1992; Hiatt et al., 2001). In ad-
dition to regulating Ras activity, neuroﬁbromin also gov-
erns G protein-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity in the
fruit ﬂy Drosophila melanogaster to control learning and
memory, neuropeptide responses, and regulation of
body size (Guo et al., 1997, 2000; Hannan et al., 2006;
The et al., 1997; Tong et al., 2002). Expression of a human
NF1 gene complements the phenotypes in NF12/2 ﬂies
associated with an adenylyl cyclase defect
(Tong
et al., 2002). Similarly, neuroﬁbromin controls adenylyl
cyclase activity in response to the neuropeptide PACAP
in mammals (Dasgupta et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2002).
Therefore, neuroﬁbromin governs adenylyl cyclase ac-
tivity not only in yeast but also in ﬂies and in mammals.
Importantly, Ira1 binds to Cyr1, and this interaction plays
a crucial role in Cyr1 activation (Mitts et al., 1991). Be-
cause heterologous expression of the GRD from mam-
malian neuroﬁbromin rescues yeast ira1 and ira2 mutant
phenotypes (Ballester et al., 1989; Ballester et al., 1990;
Martin et al., 1990; Tanaka et al., 1990a; Xu et al., 1990a),
Ira1/2 are structural and functional counterparts of
mammalian neuroﬁbromin and play key conserved roles
in regulating both Ras and adenylyl cyclase.

Our studies identiﬁed the GBD in the C-terminal region
of the yeast Ira1/2 proteins; importantly, this region is
conserved in the ﬂy and mammalian homologs (2247–
2417 aa in human NF1, Figure 7). Analysis of the muta-
tional spectra in the NF1 gene from NF1 patients reveals
that many mutations lie downstream of the GRD and
many missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice site
mutations map near or even within the GBD homologous
region (Ars et al., 2003; Fahsold et al., 2000; Origone
et al., 2002). These downstream mutations presumably
leave the GRD functional but may affect protein stability
of neuroﬁbromin and lead to the development of NF1.
Importantly, neuroﬁbromin stability is controlled via pro-
teolysis by a ubiquitin/proteasome system (Cichowski
et al., 2003). Mammalian cells express a myriad of kelch
repeat proteins, and most of these remain to be charac-
terized at a functional level. In many previous examples,
signaling precedents established ﬁrst in yeast were later
found to also operate in multicellular eukaryotes. Our
studies suggest that kelch repeat proteins related to
Gpb1/2 may play an analogous role in controlling neuro-
ﬁbromin stability and signaling in ﬂies and humans and
might therefore provide clues to understand how NF1
develops and stimulate the development of therapeutic
interventions.

Experimental Procedures

Strains, Media, and Plasmids
Media and standard yeast experimental procedures were as de-
scribed (Sherman, 1991). A heterozygous diploid gpb1,2::loxP/
gpb1,2::loxP gpa2::loxP-G418/GPA2 ras2::nat/ras2::nat strain was
isolated after a cross between stains THY387a and THY389a. Yeast
strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Tables S1
and S2.

Phenotypic Analysis
Pseudohyphal and invasive growth assays, sensitivity to nitrogen
starvation, glycogen accumulation, Northern analysis, and cAMP
assay were conducted as described previously (Harashima and
Heitman, 2002). In cAMP assay data shown in Figures 1G and 3G,
the values shown are the mean of two independent experiments.

Preparation of Crude Cell Extracts
Total cell extracts from yeast cells that were grown to midlog phase
(OD600 y 0.8) in YPD or synthetic drop-out media were prepared in
lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 120 mM NaCl, 0.3% CHAPS, 1
mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 20 mM b-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na-or-
thovanadate, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors [Calbiochem, cocktail
IV], and 0.5 mM PMSF) by using a bead beater. Because the levels of
the full-length Ira1/2 and Ira1/2 N- and C-terminal deletion variant
proteins in crude extracts were too low to detect by Western blot,
the full-length and deletion Ira1/2 proteins were immunoprecipitated
by using anti-HA agarose beads, eluted, subjected to Western anal-
ysis, and examined for protein stability and indicated as ‘‘Input’’ in
Figures 2, 4, and 5 and Figure S1.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis
HA-tagged Ira1/2 proteins were captured by using anti-HA agarose
beads (F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were then
washed three times with lysis buffer, once with PBS, and once
with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 100 mM KCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 20 mM b-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors
[Calbiochem, cocktail IV], and 0.5 mM PMSF) for 5 min each. After
washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by the addi-
tion of HA peptide (Roche) at a ﬁnal concentration of w800 mg/ml in
elution buffer with incubation for 30 min at 30ºC. FLAG-tagged pro-
teins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 afﬁnity gel
(SIGMA), the beads were washed, and protein complexes were
then eluted by incubating for 30 min at room temperature with
FLAG peptide (SIGMA) at a ﬁnal concentration of w500 mg/ml in elu-
tion buffer. The eluted proteins were subjected to Western analysis
with anti-HA (F-7 or Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG
M2 antibodies (SIGMA). Endogenous Ras2 protein levels were ana-
lyzed with an anti-Ras2 antibody (yC-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
The Fpr1 protein served as a loading control and was examined with
a polyclonal anti-Fpr1 antibody (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).

Mass Spectrometry
The eluted protein samples were TCA precipitated, washed with ac-
etone, resuspended in Tris buffer, 8 M urea, pH 8.6, reduced with 100
mM TCEP, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. Trypsin diges-
tion was performed in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 to enhance spec-
iﬁcity. Peptide mixtures were analyzed as described by Washburn
et al.
(2001). A FLAG-tagged GFP protein (pTH100) served as
a mock control.

Ras-GTP Detection
Total cellular extracts were prepared as above and employed for
coimmunoprecipitation by using a GST-fused Ras binding domain
(RBD) from the Raf1 kinase that preferentially binds to Ras-GTP
(EZ-DETECT Ras activation kit, PIERCE Biotechnology). Experimen-
tal procedures were followed per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cycloheximide-Chase Assay
Cycloheximide (CHX) was added to exponentially growing cells at
a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mg/ml to inhibit de novo protein synthesis.
At the time points indicated, cells were collected and washed. Total
cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation
for Ira1/2 or SDS-PAGE for Fpr1 as above.
