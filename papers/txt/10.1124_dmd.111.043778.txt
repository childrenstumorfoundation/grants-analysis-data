ABSTRACT:

[3,4-Difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-phenyl]-((S)-3-hy-
droxy-3-piperidin-2-yl-azetidin-1-yl)-methanone (GDC-0973) is a po-
tent and highly selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein
kinase(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (MEK1/
2), a MAPK kinase that activates ERK1/2. The objectives of these
studies were to characterize the disposition of GDC-0973 in preclin-
ical species and to determine the relationship of GDC-0973 plasma
concentrations to efficacy in Colo205 mouse xenograft models. The
clearance (CL) of GDC-0973 was moderate in mouse (33.5 ml 䡠 minⴚ1 䡠
kgⴚ1), rat (37.9 ⴞ 7.2 ml 䡠 minⴚ1 䡠 kgⴚ1), and monkey (29.6 ⴞ 8.5 ml 䡠
minⴚ1 䡠 kgⴚ1). CL in dog was low (5.5 ⴞ 0.3 ml 䡠 minⴚ1 䡠 kgⴚ1). The
volume of distribution across species was large, 6-fold to 15-fold
body water; half-lives ranged from 4 to 13 h. Protein binding in mouse,
rat, dog, monkey, and human was high, with percentage unbound, 1
to 6%. GDC-0973-related radioactivity was rapidly and extensively

distributed to tissues; however, low concentrations were observed in
the brain. In rats and dogs, [14C]GDC-0973 was well absorbed (frac-
tion absorbed, 70–80%). The majority of [14C]GDC-0973-related ra-
dioactivity was recovered in the bile of rat (74–81%) and dog (65%).
The CL and volume of distribution of GDC-0973 in human, predicted
by allometry, was 2.9 ml 䡠 minⴚ1 䡠 kgⴚ1 and 9.9 l/kg, respectively. The
predicted half-life was 39 h. To characterize the relationship between
plasma concentration of GDC-0973 and tumor growth inhibition,
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was applied using an
indirect response model. The KC50 value for tumor growth inhibition
in Colo205 xenografts was estimated to be 0.389 ␮M, and the pre-
dicted clinical efficacious dose was ⬃10 mg. Taken together, these
data are useful in assessing the disposition of GDC-0973, and where
available, comparisons with human data were made.

tumor cells. Four major mammalian MAPK pathway modules have
been identified: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2),
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase, and ERK5 (Johnson
and Lapadat, 2002; Roberts and Der, 2007). Each pathway stimulates
different effector pathways. The ERK/MAPK signaling cascade trans-
duces multiple proliferation and differentiation signals within the cell
via activation of the RAS GTPase and subsequent sequential activa-
tion of RAF, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and ERK kinases. Aberrant
regulation of this pathway contributes to many hallmarks of cancer
cells, including uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, metastasis, an-
giogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis (Downward, 2003; Roberts and

CHOO ET AL.

Der, 2007). Inhibition of MEK is a promising strategy in the devel-
opment of oncology therapeutics to control the growth of tumors that
are dependent on aberrant ERK/MAPK pathway signaling (Wellbrock
et al., 2004; Solit et al., 2006; Hoeflich et al., 2008).

[3,4-Difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-phenyl]-((S)-3-
hydroxy-3-piperidin-2-yl-azetidin-1-yl)-methanone (GDC-0973) (Fig. 1)
is an allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2, with a MEK1 IC50 of 4.2 nM. It
shows ⬎100⫻ selectivity against ⬎100 kinases (Belvin et al., 2010). In
Colo205 cells (BRAF V600E mutant), the IC50 values associated with
cellular inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation were 1.8
and 8 nM, respectively. Cellular inhibition of ERK1/2 was also observed
in other tumor cell lines that are dependent on aberrant ERK/MAPK
pathway signaling, e.g., harboring the BRAF and KRAS mutation(s). In
addition, in vivo efficacy is observed in BRAF and KRAS mutant cell
lines both as a single-agent GDC-0973 and in combination with 2-(1H-
indazol-4-yl)-6-[[4-(methylsulfonyl)-1-piperazinyl]methyl]-4-(4-
morpholinyl)-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (GDC-0941) (Hoeflich et al.,
2009; Belvin et al., 2010; Rosen et al., 2011). GDC-0973 is currently
undergoing oncology clinical trials both as a single agent and in combi-
nation with GDC-0941 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor)
and vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) (National Institutes of Health, www.
clinicaltrials.gov). The effort to modulate MEK is a competitive area of
research as evidenced by the multiple MEK inhibitors at various stages of
clinical development, e.g., AZD6244, AZD8330, (S)-N-(2,3-dihydroxypro-
pyl)-3-((2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino)isonicotinamide (AS703026), N-{3-
[3-cyclopropyl-5-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6,8-dimethyl-2,4,7-trioxo-
3,4,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide
(GSK1120212), (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-
methoxyphenyl)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-1-sulfonamide
(RDEA119), RO4987644, and 3-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-5-(2-
fluoro-4-iodoanilino)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,7-dione (TAK-
733) (Fre´min and Meloche, 2010).

The objective of the studies/data presented here was to characterize
the disposition of GDC-0973 in preclinical species and to determine
the relationship of GDC-0973 plasma concentrations to efficacy in
Colo205 (V600E; colon) mouse xenograft models. Where available,
comparisons are made to observed human data.

Materials and Methods

Chemicals and Reagents. GDC-0973 was synthesized by Exelixis Inc.
(South San Francisco, CA) and Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA).
[14C]GDC-0973 (radiochemical purity ⬎98%) was synthesized at Ricerca
(Solon, OH). All other reagents or material used in these studies were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.

In Vitro Studies. MDCK cell permeability. The MDCKI cell line was ac-
quired from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). GDC-0973
was added to either the apical or the basolateral side of the monolayer at an
initial concentration of 10 ␮M and was incubated at 37°C for 90 min. The
apparent permeability (Papp), in the apical-to-basolateral (A-B) and basolat-
⫽ (dQ/dt) 䡠 (1/AC0),
eral-to-apical (B-A) directions, was calculated as Papp

MDR1-MDCK permeability. The assay was conducted by Absorption Sys-
tems LP (Exton, PA). In the substrate assay, concentrations of 25 ␮M GDC-
0973 or 10 ␮M digoxin (positive control) were used. In some studies, the assay
buffer also contained 10 ␮M cyclosporine A or 25 ␮M GDC-0973 as potential
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. After the preincubation period, cell mono-
layers were dosed on the apical side (A-to-B) or basolateral side (B-to-A) and
were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 2 h. After
2 h of incubation, samples were taken from the donor chambers. All samples
were assayed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/

compartment versus time in ␮M s⫺1; Vr is the volume of the receiver com-
partment in cm3; Vd is the volume of the donor compartment in cm3; A is the
area of the cell monolayer (1.13 cm2 for 12-well Transwell plates); CN is the
nominal concentration of the dosing solution in ␮M.

Blood-to-plasma partitioning. The blood-to-plasma partitioning of GDC-
0973 was assessed in pooled whole blood from CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley
rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans (Bioreclamation, Inc.,
Hicksville, NY). Blood from all species was obtained from at least three
individual donors. The blood-to-plasma partitioning of GDC-0973 and
[14C]GDC-0973 was determined at whole-blood concentrations of 1, 5, and 10
␮M. Blood samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a shaking water bath.
The blood-to-plasma ratio was calculated by dividing the measured radioac-
tivity in blood by that measured in plasma. Incubations were performed in
quadruplicate. Parameters are presented as mean ⫾ S.D.

Plasma protein binding. The extent of plasma protein binding of GDC-0973
was determined in vitro, in mouse, rat, monkey, dog, and human plasma
(Bioreclamation, Inc.), as well as human serum albumin (HSA; 40 mg/ml) and
␣-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG; 1 mg/ml) by equilibrium dialysis using an
HTDialysis 96-well block (HTDialysis LLC, Gales Ferry, CT), as described
previously (Choo et al., 2009). GDC-0973 and [14C]GDC-0973 were added to
pooled plasma (n ⱖ 3) at total concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 ␮M. Plasma
samples were equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37°C in
90% humidity and 5% CO2 for 5 h. The percentage GDC-0973 unbound in
plasma was determined by dividing the radioactivity measured in the postdi-
alysis buffer by that measured in the post-dialysis plasma and multiplying by
100. Incubations were performed in quadruplicate. Parameters are presented as
mean ⫾ S.D. Using a similar method, brain binding of GDC-0973 was
determined as described previously (Kalvass et al., 2007).

Metabolic stability study in liver microsomes. The oxidative metabolism of
GDC-0973 was evaluated in pooled liver microsomes (Celsis, Chicago, IL) of
CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, and
humans (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (Salphati et al.,
2011). The Incubation mixture contained 0.5 mg/ml microsomal protein and 1
␮M GDC-0973. Reaction was initiated with the addition of NADPH. Samples
were incubated at 37°C, aliquots were sampled at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min, and
the percentage of GDC-0973 remaining was determined by LC-MS/MS using
the t ⫽ 0 peak area ratio values as 100%. The in vitro intrinsic clearance and
scaled hepatic clearance (CL) were determined as described by Obach et al.
(1997).

In Vivo Studies. Studies were performed at Genentech Inc. by Exelixis,
Covance Laboratories (Madison, WI, Kalamazoo, MI, or Alice, TX), or QPS
LLC (Newark, DE). Food and water were available ad libitum except for
animals that were administered oral doses in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies,
which were fasted overnight before dosing of GDC-0973. In all studies, blood
samples were collected in tubes containing K2EDTA as the anticoagulant.
Plasma was isolated and stored at ⫺80°C until analysis. The concentration of
GDC-0973 in each plasma and/or tissue sample was determined by LC-
MS/MS analysis.

PK study in mouse. Twenty-seven female nu/nu mice (Charles River Lab-
oratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were given a 1 mg/kg i.v. dose (4 ml/kg
dosing volume) of GDC-0973 hydrochloride (HCl) salt in 60% propyl ethylene
glycol 400 (60% v/v) and water (40% v/v). Another group of 27 mice at each
dose level received 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg p.o. (4 ml/kg dosing volume) of
GDC-0973, formulated in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose/0.2% (v/v) Tween-80
(MCT). At the initiation of the study, the mice weighed from 20 to 27 g. One

blood sample of approximately 0.2 ml was collected from each mouse (n ⫽ 3
mice per time point) by terminal cardiac puncture, under anesthesia with
isoflurane. Blood samples were collected at predose and at 0.033, 0.16, 0.5, 1,
3, 6, 9, and 24 h after the intravenous administration, and at predose and at
0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h after the oral dose.

In additional studies, GDC-0973 was administered at 3 mg/kg p.o. (dosing
volume 4 ml/kg) to nu/nu mice. Brain and plasma were collected 2, 6, 10, 24,
and 48 h (n ⫽ 3/time point) after the fifth dose, to take into consideration any
possible accumulation and extended half-life in tissue and to ensure that
sampling occurred at steady state. In addition to concentrations of GDC-0973
in brain, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) levels
(as a biomarker of target knockdown) in brain tissue were determined. In
another separate study, brain, tumor (Colo205), and plasma were collected
from mice at 2 h (n ⫽ 3). All collected blood samples were centrifuged within
1 h of collection, and plasma was collected and stored at ⫺80°C until analysis.
Brain and tumor were homogenized in 3 volumes of water.

PK study in rat. Jugular vein-cannulated female CD rats (12 weeks old,
⬃200 g) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Animals
were acclimatized for 48 h before study initiation. Four rats were each given
a single intravenous or oral dose of 3 mg/kg (10 ml/kg dosing volume)
GDC-0973 HCl salt in 0.9% normal saline. Blood samples (approximately 0.2
ml/sample) were drawn from each animal via the jugular vein cannulae at
predose and at 0.02, 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h postdose. The
samples were collected into tubes containing K2EDTA as an anticoagulant.
Plasma was isolated and kept at ⫺80°C until analysis. The concentration of
GDC-0973 in plasma was determined by LC-MS/MS.

PK study in cynomolgus monkey. Six male cynomolgus monkeys (3.5– 4.7
kg; Covance Laboratories) were administered GDC-0973 HCl. Three animals
each were administered an intravenous (3 mg/kg) and oral (3 mg/kg) dose.
GDC-0973 dose solutions were prepared in 0.9% normal saline and were
administered at a dosing volume of 1 ml/kg. Blood samples (⬃1 ml/sample)
were collected from the femoral vein at predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after intravenous and oral dose administration.

PK study in beagle dogs. Six male Beagle dogs (Covance Laboratories;
10.0 –11.1 kg) were administered GDC-0973 as the HCl salt. Three animals
each were administered an intravenous (3 mg/kg) and oral (3 mg/kg) dose.
GDC-0973 dose solutions were prepared in 0.9% normal saline and were
administered at a dosing volume of 1 ml/kg. Blood samples (⬃2 ml) were
collected from the jugular vein at predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
12, 24, and 48 h after intravenous and oral dose administration.

LC-MS/MS Analysis. GDC-0973 concentrations were determined by LC-
MS/MS after protein precipitation with acetonitrile and injection of the super-
natant onto the column. The column was an Eclipse XBD-C18 (50 ⫻ 4.6 mm,
5-␮m particle size) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A CTC HTS
PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC) linked to a Shimadzu
LC-10AD pump (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD), coupled with a Sciex API 4000
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),
was used for the LC-MS/MS assay. The aqueous mobile phase was water with
0.1% formic acid, and the organic mobile phase was acetonitrile with 0.1%
formic acid. The total run time was 3 min, and the ionization was conducted
in the positive-ion mode using the transition m/z 530.25 3 126.75. The lower
and upper limits of quantitation of the assay were 0.004 and 40 ␮M, respec-
tively. The internal standard used in the assays was the 6C13 analog of
GDC-0973.

PK Analysis. PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental meth-
ods as described in Gibaldi and Perrier (1982) using WinNonlin (Pharsight,
Mountain View, CA) version 5.1.1. Parameters are presented as mean ⫾ S.D.
Bioavailability (F) was determined by dividing the dose-normalized area under
the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity
(AUCinf) for each animal dosed orally by the dose-normalized mean AUCinf
determined from the animals dosed intravenously (a pooled profile was used in
mice).

Determination of pERK Inhibition in Mouse Brain. To test whether
MEK pathway inhibition (as measured by pERK inhibition) was observed in
the brain at efficacious doses, brain tissue from mice was collected and
prepared for Western blotting using methods described previously (Choo et al.,
2010). Antibodies to pERK and total ERK proteins were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Specific antigen-antibody interaction

was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
IgG using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents
(GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography in Rat. The tissue distribu-
tion of [14C]GDC-0973-related radioactivity in male Long-Evans rats (Harlan,
Scottsdale, PA) was investigated after a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg (100
␮Ci/kg) [14C]GDC-0973 (Ricera BioScience LLC, Concord, OH) combined
with GDC-0973 formulated in MCT. One animal was euthanized under iso-
flurane anesthesia at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, 72, 96, 240, 480, and 672 h postdose. The
carcasses were frozen in hexane dry ice and stored at ⫺20°C before processing
for quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). Before section collec-
tion, standards fortified with 14C radioactivity were placed into the frozen
block containing the carcass. Each carcass was embedded, cut into sagittal
sections, and mounted for QWBA. Selected sections were exposed to phosphor
image screens, and exposed screens were scanned along with plastic-embedded
ARC autoradiographic standards (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St
Louis, MO) for subsequent calibration of the image analysis software. Screens
were exposed for 4 days, after which they were scanned using a Storm Scanner
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sunnyvale, CA). Tissue radioactivity concen-
trations were quantified from the whole-body autoradiograms using Imaging
Research AIS software (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, ON, Canada) on the
basis of a calibrated standard curve. Concentrations of radioactivity were
expressed as microcuries per gram and were converted to microgram equiva-
lents of GDC-0973 per gram of matrix using the specific activity (55 mCi/
mmol) of the administered dose of [14C]GDC-0973, which was a combination
of radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled compound.

Mass Balance and Routes of Elimination in Rat. A single dose of
[14C]GDC-0973 (30 mg/kg, 400 ␮Ci/kg; Ricera Bioscience LLC) was admin-
istered orally to bile duct-intact (n ⫽ 3 male and 3 female) and bile duct-
cannulated (BDC) male (n ⫽ 3) Sprague-Dawley rats (QPS LLC, Newark,
DE). The dose was prepared MCT. Urine and feces were collected in plastic
containers surrounded by dry ice at predose (overnight for at least 12 h) and 0
to 8 and 8 to 24 h postdose, and at 24-h intervals through 48 (BDC rats) or
192 h (intact rats) postdose. Bile was collected from BDC animals in plastic
containers surrounded by dry ice at predose and 0 to 8, 8 to 24, and 24 to 48 h
postdose. Blood (approximately 0.5 ml) was collected from a jugular vein via
syringe and needle and was transferred into tubes containing K2EDTA as the
anticoagulant at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h postdose. All
samples were stored at approximately ⫺70°C before and after analysis. Blood
was stored at approximately 4°C until centrifuged. Plasma was harvested,
aliquoted, and stored at approximately ⫺70°C. Feces or feces homogenate was
combusted using a model 307 Sample Oxidizer (PerkinElmer, Downers Grove,
IL), and the resulting 14CO2 was trapped in a mixture of Perma-Fluor and
Carbo-Sorb (PerkinElmer). Ultima Gold XR scintillation cocktail was added to
all other samples and was analyzed directly. Samples were analyzed in dupli-
cate or triplicate (feces). Radioactivity content was quantified by liquid scin-
tillation counting [model 2800TR liquid scintillation counters (PerkinElmer)]
for at least 5 min or 100,000 counts.

Mass Balance and Routes of Elimination in Dog. A single dose of
[14C]GDC-0973 (5 mg/kg, 20 ␮Ci/kg; Ricera Bioscience LLC) was adminis-
tered orally to bile duct-intact (n ⫽ 2 male and 2 female) and BDC male (n ⫽
2) Beagle dogs (Covance Laboratories). The dose was prepared in MCT. Urine
and feces were collected in plastic containers surrounded by dry ice at predose
(overnight for at least 12 h) and at 0 to 8 and 8 to 24 h postdose, and at 24-h
intervals through 168 (BDC dogs) or 240 h (intact dogs) postdose. Bile was
collected from BDC animals into plastic containers surrounded by dry ice
predose at 0 to 8, 8 to 24, and at 24-h intervals through 168 h postdose. Blood
(approximately 5 ml) was collected from intact dogs from a jugular vein via
syringe and needle and was transferred into tubes containing K2EDTA as the
anticoagulant at predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,
168, and 240 h postdose in both intact and BDC dogs. All samples were stored,
prepared, and analyzed as described for the rat mass balance study above.

Colo205 Xenograft Efficacy Studies. Five million human colorectal car-
cinoma Colo205 cells were resuspended in Hanks’ buffered salt solution and
were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of naive female athymic
nu/nu mice. Tumors were monitored until they reached a mean volume of 200
to 300 mm3. Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded twice weekly, and
the mice were observed regularly over the course of the study. Mice were

euthanized if their tumor volume exceeded 2000 mm3 or if their body weight
dropped by more than 20% of the starting weight. Ten mice were randomly
assigned to each group on the basis of mean tumor volume. Mean tumor
volume across all six groups was 200 mm3 at the start of dosing. Tumor
volumes were measured in two dimensions (length and width) using Ultra
Cal-IV calipers (model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler Company, Inc., Newton,
MA). The following formula was used with Excel version 11.2 (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA) to calculate tumor volume (TV): TV (mm3) ⫽
(length ⫻ width2) ⫻ 0.5.

GDC-0973 or vehicle was administered daily (at a similar time of the day)
by oral gavage for 20 days or until animals lost ⬎20% of body weight or until
tumor size was ⬎2000 mm3. Animals in vehicle groups received 100 ␮l of
MCT. Treatment groups (n ⫽ 10 mice/group) received oral doses of GDC-
0973 formulated in 100 ␮l of MCT. The treatment groups were as follows:
vehicle, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg.

PK-Pharmacodynamic Modeling. Fitting of the PK-pharmacodynamic
(PD) model to the efficacy data and mouse PK were performed using SAAM
II (Saam Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA).

An indirect response model (Mager et al., 2003) was used to fit the

xenograft efficacy data; the differential equation is as follows:

where

⫽ kng(TV) ⫺ K(TV)

K ⫽

Kmax ⫻ Cn
n ⫹ Cn

TV (mm3) is defined as the tumor volume, t (h) is time, kng (h⫺1) is
the net growth rate constant, K (h⫺1) is the rate constant describing the
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) effects of GDC-0973, Kmax (h⫺1) is the
maximal value of K, C (␮M) is the concentration of GDC-0973, n is
the Hill coefficient, and KC50 (␮M) is the GDC-0973 concentration
where K is 50% of Kmax. Concentrations of GDC-0973 in mice were
simulated on the basis of parameters obtained from fitting the time-
concentration data from PK studies. Mean tumor volumes for each
dose group were used in the fitting. All dose groups were fit simul-
taneously. PD parameters are presented as the estimate followed by
the percentage CV in parentheses. Concentration required for tumor
stasis (Cstasis) was calculated as the concentration where K is equal
to kng.

Prediction of Human PK Parameters and Efficacious Doses. Prediction
of human CL and volume of distribution for GDC-0973 was performed
prospectively by allometric scaling on the basis of the equation CL ⫽ aWb,
where a, W, and b are the allometric coefficient, body weight, and allometric
exponent, respectively (Boxenbaum, 1982). Total plasma CL and volume of
distribution values obtained from PK studies in preclinical species were scaled
on the basis of body weight to predict the systemic CL and volume of
distribution in human. Body weights of 0.02, 0.25, 10, 3, and 70 kg were used
for mouse, rat, dog, monkeys, and human, respectively. The human dose
associated with 90% TGI was simulated on the basis of parameter estimates
from PK-PD modeling of Colo205 xenografts in mouse and by substituting
human predicted PK parameters for mouse PK estimates.

Results

Permeability in MDCK and MDR1-MDCK Cells. GDC-0973
mean Papp (n ⫽ 8) in MDCK cells was moderate with A-B values of
1.39 ⫾ 0.271 10⫺6 cm/s and B-A values of 4.00 ⫾ 0.215 10⫺6 cm/s.
The ER was low at ⬃3.0, suggesting minor involvement of efflux
transporter(s) in the B-A direction in this cell line. In the MDR1-
transfected MDCK cell line, the A-B value was 0.88 ⫾ 0.05 and the
B-A ratio was 35.4 ⫾ 6.0 10⫺6 cm/s, with a mean ER of 40,
confirming the involvement of MDR1. Cyclosporine (25 ␮M) was
able to increase the A-B ratio to 2.57 ⫾ 0.45 10⫺6 cm/s and decrease
the ER to 1.6. In comparison, for digoxin (the positive control), the

ER was 72. These data suggest that GDC-0973 appears to be a
substrate of MDR1. In this assay, GDC-0973 (25 ␮M) did not appear
to be an inhibitor of MDR1 (based on inhibition of digoxin efflux;
data not shown).

In Vitro Protein Binding and Blood-to-Plasma Partitioning.
Plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis at GDC-
0973 concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 ␮M in mouse, rat, cynomolgus
monkey, dog, and human pooled plasma. GDC-0973 was highly bound
to plasma protein, with the highest percentage of unbound GDC-0973
varying approximately 10-fold between species (Table 1).

GDC-0973 appeared to be more highly bound to ␣-1-acid glyco-
protein (AAG) compared with albumin. Protein binding across species
was independent of concentration (1–10 ␮M). The free fraction of
GDC-0973 in mouse brain homogenates was determined to be 0.12%.
Blood-to-plasma partitioning of GDC-0973 was evaluated in
mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, dog, and human pooled whole blood
at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 ␮M. Mean blood-to-plasma ratios
ranged from 0.623 to 1.51 in all species tested and were independent
of concentration (Table 2). Thus, GDC-0973 shows no substantial
binding to red blood cell components.

Metabolic Stability Study in Liver Microsomes. The predicted
hepatic CL of GDC-0973 from the metabolic stability after a 1-h
incubation in liver microsomes in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and
human was 45, 30, 14, 34, and 10 ml 䡠 min⫺1 䡠 kg⫺1, respectively.
Except for dog, the predicted CL was generally well predicted by
microsomes.

Pharmacokinetics of GDC-0973 in Mouse, Rat, Cynomolgus
Monkey, and Dog. The semilog plots of GDC-0973 plasma concen-
tration versus time for mouse, rat, monkey, and dog after intravenous
and oral administrations are presented in Fig. 2. The PK parameters
are presented in Table 3. Total blood CL for all species was in the
moderate range (relative to liver blood flow) (Davies and Morris,
1993). Terminal half-life values ranged from approximately 4 h in
the mouse to 13 h in the rat. The volume of distribution at steady
state (Vss) was moderate to high in all species evaluated. After oral
administration, bioavailability ranged from 20 in monkey to 93%
in mouse.

Determination of GDC-0973 Concentrations and pERK Inhi-
bition in Mouse Brain. Taking into account the free fraction of
GDC-0973 in mouse brain (fu 0.0012), the unbound AUC of GDC-
0973 was low, 0.003 ␮M 䡠 h. The low concentration of GDC-0973 in
the brain is consistent with the lack of pERK inhibition observed in
the brain (Fig. 3B). This is in comparison with the pERK knockdown
observed with the positive control. In a separate study, at the 2-h time
point, the brain unbound concentrations at the 3 mg/kg dose was
0.0001 ␮⌴, and the unbound plasma concentration was 0.0057 ␮⌴,
resulting in a unbound brain-to-plasma ratio of 0.018 (total brain-to-

plasma ratio ⬃0.5). The low penetration of GDC-0973 into the brain
suggests that GDC-0973 is effluxed out of the brain. Interestingly, the
total tumor (Colo205) concentration of GDC-0973 at the 2-h time
point was 1.56 ␮⌴ (total tumor-to-plasma ratio ⬃9), suggesting that
GDC-0973 accumulates in tumors.

Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography in Rat. After oral
administration of 14[C]GDC-0973 (30 mg/kg), compound related ra-
dioactivity in tissue was observed by 2 h post dose with extensive
distribution into tissues and organs (Fig. 3A). The tissues showing the
highest peak concentrations were the liver, large intestine, lungs,
adrenal glands and lacrimal glands. Radioactivity in the central ner-
vous system e.g., the cerebrum were low and were below the levels of
detection by 4 h postdose. By 72 h, in most tissues, radioactivity levels
were below the limit of detection with the exception for the organs of
elimination e.g., liver, kidney intestine, as well as melanin containing
tissue.

Mass Balance and Routes of Elimination in Rat. The excretion of
radioactivity was determined after administration of a single oral dose
of [14C]GDC-0973 (30 mg/kg) to bile duct-intact and BDC male and
female Sprague-Dawley rats. [14C]GDC-0973-related radioactivity
was rapidly excreted after oral administration to bile duct-intact male
and female rats, primarily within the first 48 h after dosing (⬃80%
excreted). Routes and rates of excretion were similar in both males
and females (Fig. 4, A and B). A high percentage of radioactivity was
recovered in feces (⬃85%), and only 2.2 to 4.4% of radioactivity was
recovered in urine (Fig. 4A). Approximately 74 to 81% of the admin-
istered radioactivity was recovered in the bile of BDC rats through
48 h postdose (Fig. 4B), with low amounts of radioactivity in feces.
The combined recovery in urine and bile indicated that approximately
80% of the oral dose was absorbed in male and female BDC rats.

Mass Balance and Routes of Elimination in Dog. The excretion
of radioactivity was determined after administration of a single oral
dose of [14C]GDC-0973 (5 mg/kg) to bile duct-intact and BDC male
and female Beagle dogs. Approximately 80% of [14C]GDC-0973-
derived radioactivity was excreted after oral administration to dogs
within the first 72 h after dosing. Routes and rates of excretion were
similar in both males and females (Fig. 4C). A high percentage of
radioactivity was recovered in feces (⬃80%), and only 6.3 to 7.0% of
radioactivity was recovered in urine (Fig. 4C). Approximately 65%
of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the bile of BDC dogs
through 168 h postdose (Fig. 4C), with a low amount of radioactivity
recovered in feces. The combined recovery in urine and bile indicated that
approximately 70% of the oral dose was absorbed in BDC dogs.

In Vivo Xenograft Potency Assessment. TGI curves after a range
of oral doses of GDC-0973 in Colo205 (BRAF V600E mutant)
xenograft tumor-bearing mice are shown in Fig. 5A. Overall, GDC-
0973 showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth up to a dose
of 10 mg/kg with saturation of efficacy observed at the highest dose
tested (30 mg/kg). Figure 5B compares observed and predicted tumor
volumes after simultaneous fitting of a simple indirect response model
to the Colo205 tumor data (eq. 1). In general, a simple indirect
response model was able to adequately characterize the PK-PD rela-
tionship between GDC-0973 plasma concentrations and TGI. Esti-
mated in vivo GDC-0973 PD parameters (%CV) characterizing the
⫽ 0.389 ␮M (21) (207 ng/ml; total
relationship were as follows: KC50
⫽ 0.00372 h⫺1 (3), and
concentration), Kmax

was 0.05 ␮M (the concentration where the K is equal to kng).

Human PK and Dose Predictions. On the basis of allometry with
maximal
life-span potential (MLP) correction for CL (exponent
⬎0.7), the correlation coefficient of the linear regression of log CL or
volume of distribution (across species) versus log body weight was
0.94 and 0.85 for CL and volume of distribution, respectively. A total
human plasma CL and volume of distribution of 2.9 ml 䡠 min⫺1 䡠 kg⫺1
and 9.9 l/kg, respectively, were predicted on the basis of the following
regressions: CL ⫻ MLP ⫽ 2.23W1.11 and volume of distribution ⫽
1.13W0.93. Because the current literature does not suggest that ac-
counting for protein binding increases the accuracy in predicting
human CL (Mahmood, 2005), the dose predictions were based on total
CL. Assuming a one-compartment PK model, the predicted CL,
⬃ 39 h), an
volume of distribution, half-life (ke
absorption rate constant (ka) of 1.00 h⫺1 (on the basis of the ka from
fitting the dog PK data), and an assumed bioavailability of 80%, an
estimate of a human PK profile was predicted. The predicted human
dose (based on predicted PK) associated with the 90% TGI (compared
with vehicle) at the end of study based on estimates from fitting the
data from the Colo205 model was determined to be approximately 10
mg, dosed daily. The predicted human PK profiles associated with a
10-mg dose based on a one-compartment model are shown in Fig. 5C
[area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of ⬃655 ng 䡠 h/ml and ⬃11

2010). Signs of clinical activity have been reported for GDC-0973 (Rosen
et al., 2011) and GSK1120212 (Gilmartin et al., 2011) in Phase Ib trials
in melanoma tumors bearing the BRAF V600E mutation. In addition, the
BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, which acts downstream of MEK, has
shown efficacy in the treatment of BRAF V600E melanoma (Flaherty et
al., 2009; Puzanov et al., 2009; Bollag et al., 2010) and has been approved
for treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma.

Before clinical development of a compound, as part of the discov-
ery process, preclinical assessment is conducted to understand the
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the compound.
In addition, preclinical efficacy is also assessed and exposure-efficacy
relationships are characterized. Collectively, this information forms
the basis for predicting the human disposition, efficacy, and target
dose of a compound in humans. Finally, when clinical information

CHOO ET AL.

becomes available, it is important to retrospectively revisit earlier
predictions to learn and confirm from previous experiences.

GDC-0973 is characterized to have high protein binding across
species (⬃1– 6% unbound). Data from the rat QWBA study suggest
that GDC-0973 is distributed rapidly and extensively into tissues. In
the QWBA study, the highest concentration of compound-related
radioactivity was observed in liver and bile, persisting beyond mea-
surable levels in blood. This is consistent with data from the mass
balance studies showing that in both rat and dog, biliary excretion is
the major pathway for GDC-0973 elimination, with renal excretion
playing a minor role. In addition, the QWBA data show low levels of
GDC-0973-related radioactivity in the brain (Fig. 3), similar to data
indicating that GDC-0973 does not appear to penetrate the brain
appreciably. In addition, pERK inhibition, a downstream biomarker
for MEK pathway inhibition, was not observed in brain tissue. The
low unbound brain-to-plasma ratio (0.018) at 2 h suggests that the
disproportionately low concentrations in brain may be limited by
efflux. This is in keeping with studies in MDCK cells overexpressing
P-gp, suggesting that GDC-0973 is a substrate for P-gp. However,
unlike in brain, levels of GDC-0973 in Colo205 tumors were greater
than plasma concentrations, suggesting lack of P-gp influence/expres-
sion in Colo205 xenograft tumors.

In preclinical species, the PK of GDC-0973 is characterized by
moderate CL across species and a large volume of distribution. There
are numerous methods that could be employed in CL predictions
(Poulin et al., 2011a; Ring et al., 2011). In the case of GDC-0973, we
chose to use allometry using all available preclinical CL data (with
MLP correction based on the exponent) for scaling total CL. On the
basis of allometry, the plasma CL in human was predicted to be low
(⬃3 ml䡠 min⫺1 䡠 kg⫺1); this is lower than the predicted CL (10 ml 䡠
min⫺1 䡠 kg⫺1) based on microsomes. On the basis of allometry, the
volume of distribution was predicted to be high (⬃10 l/kg), with a
predicted half-life of 39 h. The assumed F was 80%, which is
consistent with the moderate permeability observed in MDCKI cell
lines, the F observed in preclinical species (except monkey), the high
fraction absorbed observed in the mass balance studies in rat and dog,
and the predicted CL (F ⫽ 1 ⫺ E; assuming total CL is hepatic).
Assuming a one-compartment model, the predicted CL of 3 ml 䡠
min⫺1 䡠 kg⫺1, Vss, and F, a 10-mg dose of GDC-0973 is associated
with an AUC and Cmax of ⬃655 ng 䡠 h/ml and ⬃11 ng/ml (Tmax
⬃4
h) (Fig. 5).

It has been reported that the clinically observed half-life of GDC-
0973 ranges from 26 to 53 h (Musib et al., 2011), similar to the
predicted half-life of 39 h. At a 10-mg dose in the clinic, the observed
⬃ 4 h),
AUC and Cmax were 752 ng 䡠 h/ml and 53 ng/ml (Tmax
respectively (Musib et al., 2011). Therefore, overall, the AUC of
GDC-0973 was well predicted. However, the discrepancy (⬃5-fold)
between the predicted and observed Cmax may be explained in part by
the PK profile of GDC-0973, which was described by a two-compart-
ment model with an absorption lag time (Budha et al., 2011), whereas
a one-compartment model and absorption rate constant from dog was
applied in the predictions. It is often difficult a priori to predict the PK
profile of compounds, particularly if the profile is described by
multiple compartments. Alternative methods proposed by Dedrick et
al. (1970) or Wajima et al. (2004) and physiology-based PK modeling
have been used to project human concentration-time profiles. How-
ever, according to other studies, prediction of PK profiles of orally
dosed compounds was relatively poor using these methods (Poulin et
al., 2011b; Vuppugalla et al., 2011), highlighting the continuing
challenge in predicting oral concentration-time profiles.

Interestingly, the KC50 (16 nM; unbound plasma), describing the in
vivo potency, was consistent with the IC50 values from the enzyme

(4.2), cellular pERK (1.8), and proliferation (8 nM) assays in Colo205
cells. The predicted efficacious dose in humans was determined on the
basis of PK-PD modeling of the Colo205 (V600E mutant) mouse
xenograft efficacy data. Estimates from this modeling were used to
simulate human doses associated with 90% TGI (compared with
vehicle) in human by substituting mouse PK for predicted human PK,
thereby accounting for the difference in mouse PK and human pre-
dicted PK. According to the Colo205 model, a ⬃10-mg daily dose of
GDC-0973 is associated with 90% TGI. It has been reported that
clinical signs of efficacy have been observed with GDC-0973 in
BRAF V600E melanoma patients at doses of 60 and 100 mg, dosed
daily for 21 and 14 days, respectively, in a 28-day cycle of treatment
(Rosen et al., 2011). Considering the difference between the predicted
and observed human PK, these data suggest the Colo205 model
appears to be a sensitive model and underestimated the clinical
efficacious dose of GDC-0973 because activity was observed at
higher doses (60 mg) than predicted (⬃10 mg). Preliminary data
suggest that clinical efficacy is observed at doses where efficacy is
saturated in the Colo205 model. However, according to the H2122
(KRAS, non–small-cell
lung cancer) and A2058 (BRAF mutant,
PTEN-null model) xenograft data, higher doses are predicted to be
required for efficacy (data not shown), suggesting that less sensitive in
vivo models may provide a better prediction of the ultimate clinical
efficacious dose. Because signs of clinical efficacy are observed in
melanoma patients with the BRAF V600E mutation, the Colo205
(V600E) xenograft model appears to be the relevant genotype for
comparison. Because prospectively we do not necessarily know the
responsive tumor type(s) in the clinic, it highlights the importance for
assessing multiple models with varying sensitivity in predicting a
clinical efficacious dose.

It is also interesting to note that in the Colo205 xenograft model,
vemurafenib has been reported to show tumor stasis and regression at
exposures (AUC) between 200 and 300 ␮M 䡠 h in the mouse (Bollag
et al., 2010), whereas the clinical dose (960 mg b.i.d.) is associated
with an AUC of 1741 ␮M 䡠 h (Flaherty et al., 2010). This suggests that
as with GDC-0973, higher exposures of vemurafenib were required
clinically compared with preclinical estimates based on the Colo205
xenograft model. It is also interesting to note that the administration
of the MEK inhibitor, GSK1120212 is associated with 85 and 83%
TGI at a dose of 3 mg/kg in the Colo205 and HCT116 (KRAS mutant)
xenograft model, respectively (Gilmartin et al., 2011). However,
because mouse exposures are not reported, comparisons of mouse
exposures with human exposures at 2 mg (recommended Phase II
dose; AUC 360 ng 䡠 h/ml) where signs of efficacy have been observed
cannot be made (Infante, et al., 2010).

There are multiple caveats in translating preclinical efficacy data to
human efficacy predictions. One primary assumption is that concen-
trations required for antitumor activity translate directly from mouse
xenograft models to humans. This assumes that distribution of drug is
similar despite reported differences in tumor vasculature and transport
in xenograft versus human tumors (Jang et al., 2003). Another as-
sumption is that the capacity (Emax) and sensitivity (EC50) parameters
are conserved across species (Mager et al., 2009). In addition, noted
differences in growth rate and previous exposure of human tumors to
prior therapies may complicate the interpretation of modeled xeno-
graft data. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, there have been
numerous reports where preclinical PK-PD modeling has been suc-
cessfully applied in predicting dose targets associated with human
efficacy (Simeoni et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2008; Rocchetti et al.,
2009; Goteti et al., 2010).

Drug discovery and development is an iterative process. As com-
pounds progress in the clinic, it is important to apply the “learn and

revisited and compared the preclinical data and predictions with
observed clinical data. It is hoped that by learning from examples such
as GDC-0973, this may ultimately lead to a more successful drug
discovery/development process.
