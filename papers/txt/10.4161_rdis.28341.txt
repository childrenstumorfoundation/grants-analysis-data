the several suppressors identified in our

a potential therapeutic target by showing 
that  NF1-regulated  ALK/RAS/ERK 
signaling is conserved in human cells.

RASopathies  are  a  group  of  clinically 
related genetic disorders caused by defects 
in RAS/ERK signal transduction.1 NF1 is 
among the most common members of this 
group,  affecting  an  estimated  1  in  3000 
individuals  in  all  ethnic  groups.  High 
degrees of variability and unpredictability 
are among the hallmarks of NF1. Patients 

are predisposed to developing a variety of 
symptoms,  the  most  common  of  which 
include  benign  but  potentially  highly 
disfiguring  peripheral  nerve  associated 
tumors, termed neurofibromas. Malignant 
tumors, including peripheral nerve sheath 
tumors,  are  also  strongly  associated  with 
NF1.  Frequent  non-tumor  symptoms 
include  skeletal  and  skin  pigmentation 
abnormalities,  reduced  overall  growth, 
and  cognitive  deficits,  the  latter  seen  in 
50–70% of children with NF1.2

NF1  is  caused  by  mutations  that 
impact the function(s) of neurofibromin, 
a 
large  and  evolutionarily  conserved 
GTPase  Activating  Protein  (GAP)  for 
Ras  oncoproteins.3  Neurofibromin  and 
other  RasGAPs  accelerate  the  conversion 
of  active  Ras-GTP  into  inactive  Ras-
GDP by stimulating the low intrinsic rate 
of  Ras-GTP  hydrolysis.  While  excessive 
Ras signaling upon loss of neurofibromin 
is  undoubtedly  a  major  cause  of  NF1 
defects, evidence has also been presented 
that neurofibromin, in Ras-dependent or 
Ras-independent  ways,  acts  as  a  positive 
mediator of adenylyl cyclase activity.4-6

dNf1 expression during the larval growth 
phase is largely restricted to neurons, and 
expression  of  an  unrelated  Drosophila 
RasGAP in these cells sufficed to restore 
normal growth. Finally, although multiple 
Ras signaling mutants did not dominantly 
modify  dNf1  systemic  growth,  these 
mutants also did not reduce the elevated 
phospho-ERK level in dNf1 larval brain.12
Our  conclusion  that  neuronal  Ras/
ERK over-activation is the root cause of the 
cAMP/PKA-sensitive dNf1 growth defect 
received further support from subsequent 
work. Neuronal overexpression of the dAlk 
receptor tyrosine kinase or of its activating 
ligand  jelly  belly  (jeb)  phenocopied  dNf1 
growth  and 
learning  defects,  while 
genetic  or  pharmacological  attenuation 
of  Jeb/dAlk  signaling  suppressed  both 
phenotypes. 
implicating 
Ras-stimulated ERK over-activation, this 
study also found that neuronal expression 
of  a  constitutively  active  ERK  mutant 
phenocopied the dNf1 growth defect.13

Specifically 

To shed further light on dNf1’s role in 
organismal growth and on the mechanistic 
links  between  dNf1  and  cAMP/PKA 
signaling,  we  recently  reported  results  of 
an  unbiased  genetic  screen  for  dominant 
modifiers  of  the  dNf1  growth  defect.14 
Our  screen  analyzed  486  isogenic  first 
and  second  chromosome  deficiencies, 
each typically uncovering between 1 and 
25 genes. The deficiencies, which together 
uncover close to 80% of first and second 
chromosome genes, were crossed into the 
dNf1  null  background,  and  modifying 
deficiencies were identified by measuring 
the  length  of  pupal  cases  (Fig.  1).  After 
eliminating  deficiencies  that  also  affect 
the  size  of  wild-type  pupae,  responsible 
modifier  genes  were  identified  in  crosses 
with  available  alleles,  or  by  neuronal- 
or  glial-specific  RNAi  knockdown  of 
candidate genes.

Validating the screen, we identified dAlk, 
its  activating  ligand  jelly  belly  (jeb),  and 
the dunce (dnc) cAMP phosphodiesterase 
as  dominant  suppressors.  All  three  genes 
had  been  identified  previously  as  dNf1 
phenotypic  suppressors.11,13  Earlier  work 
had  also  established  that  heat  shock-
induced  expression  of  a  constitutively 
active  murine  PKA*  catalytic  subunit 
transgene normalized dNf1 size,8 whereas 
others  found  reduced  brain  adenylyl

~80% of first and second chromosome genes were crossed into a dNf1 null mutant background, 
and the length of the resulting pupal cases measured. Confounding factors include that size is a 
sexually dimorphic phenotype, with males being smaller than females, and that systemic growth 
is  a  multifaceted  process  influenced  by  environmental  factors,  such  as  food  availability  and 
temperature.  employing  strategies  to  minimize  these  and  other  confounding  factors,  and  after 
eliminating  those  deficiencies  with  non-specific  effects  on  growth,  candidate  dNf1  modifying 
deficiencies were examined by testing alleles or shrNai lines to identify the responsible modifier 
genes.

While there is little doubt that loss of 
NF1 affects cAMP/PKA signaling, we and 
another group have reached contradictory 
conclusions  about 
the  mechanism(s) 
involved.  Yi  Zhong  and  colleagues 
reported  that  a  C-terminal  segment  of 
human  neurofibromin  (that  does  not 
include the RasGAP catalytic domain) is 
sufficient  for  NF1/Galpha(S)-dependent 
neurotransmitter 
adenylyl 
cyclase activation and rescue of the dNf1 
growth defect.4 In contrast, we found that 
expression of a functional dNf1 RasGAP 
catalytic  domain  is  both  necessary  and 
sufficient  to  restore  the  cAMP/PKA-
sensitive  growth  deficiency.  Moreover,

surprised to identify the PKA-C1 catalytic 
subunit  as  an  enhancer,  and  the  PKA-
R2  regulatory  subunit  as  a  yet  to  be 
fully  confirmed  candidate  suppressor. 
Providing mechanistic insights, follow-up 
experiments 
growth 
regulation by dNf1 and cAMP/PKA likely 
involves  different  cells.  First,  arguing 
against  the  idea  that  PKA  suppresses 
dNf1  defects  by  attenuating  RAS/ERK 
signaling,  we  found  that  widespread  or 
tissue-specific transgenic PKA* expression 
does not reduce the elevated phospho-ERK 
level in dNf1 larval brain. Second, whereas 
only relatively widespread neuronal dNf1 
re-expression restored the mutant growth 
defect,12  in  the  current  study,  genetic 
manipulations 
increased  cAMP/
PKA  signaling  in  specific  parts  of  the 
larval ring gland (a neuroendocrine gland 
analogous  to  the  mammalian  pituitary) 
were  sufficient  to  restore  dNf1  growth. 
By  contrast,  expressing  dNf1  in  the  ring 
gland  or  widespread  neuronal  expression 
of a dncRNAi transgene outside of the ring 
gland had no effect.14 These results argue 
that  dNf1  controls  Drosophila  growth  by 
non-cell-autonomously  affecting  cAMP/
PKA signaling in the ring gland (Fig. 2). 
Whether  a  similar  non-cell-autonomous 
neuroendocrine  mechanism  underlies 
the  reduced  growth  of  patients  with 
NF1 or other RASopathies remains to be 
established.

Our screen also identified several dNf1 
growth  defect  suppressors  with  synaptic 
functions.  Examples  include  the  cAMP-
coupled  neuronal  drosulfakinin  receptor 
CCKLR-17D1,  a  positive  regulator  of 
synaptic growth, and dynamin-associated 
protein  160  (Dap160),  an  intersectin-
related  scaffold  implicated  in  synaptic 
neuroblast 
vesicle 
proliferation.  Because 
recent  work 
identified a novel dNf1 NMJ overgrowth 
phenotype,16 we tested whether suppressors 
identified in our screen also modified the 
NMJ  defect.  Suggesting  a  mechanistic 
link  between  both  phenotypes,  loss-of-
function dAlk, Jeb, and CCKLR-D1 alleles 
reduced  the  number  of  NMJ  synaptic 
boutons.14

architecture or neurotransmission defects, which appear causally linked to the reduced growth 
phenotype.  Suggesting  a  neuroendocrine  non-cell-autonomous  mechanism,  increasing  caMp/

formation  and 
orthologs 
neuronal  differentiation.  Thus,  work 
in  C.  elegans  suggested  that  the  F-box 
protein  FSN-1  and  the  RING  finger 
protein  RPM-1  form  a  ubiquitin  ligase 
complex  that  controls  synapse  stability 
by  targeting  ALK  ortholog  T10H9.2/
SCD-2.17 In Drosophila, Jeb and dAlk are 
both enriched at synapses,18 and function 
to  control  neurotransmission  strength 
and synaptic architecture.19 Based on our 
results,  one  might  speculate  that  dAlk 
controls  synaptic  growth  by  activating 
a  dNf1-regulated  Ras/ERK 
signal. 
However, reconciling our data with these 
other results is less than straightforward, 
since  dNf1  is  primarily  expressed  in 
neurons  and  plays 
its  growth-related 
role in these cells (i.e., presynaptically),14 
whereas  others  concluded  that  NMJ 
differentiation 
involves  the  activation 
of  postsynaptic  (i.e.,  muscle  expressed) 
dAlk  by  presynaptically  released  Jeb.19 
Although  we  can  only  speculate  at  this 
point,  one  potential  explanation  is  that 
the growth-related role of Jeb, dAlk, and 

dNf1  involves  aberrant  synaptogenesis 
between  neurons,  rather  than  at  the 
NMJ.  It  is  worth  noting  in  this  respect 
that  murine  neurofibromin  has  been 
implicated  in  synaptic  differentiation,20 
and  that  a  recent  ultrastructural  study 
found  reduced  curvature  at  concave 
synapses 
in 
the  hippocampus  of 
Nf1+/− mice.21

Loss  of  dAlk  or  Jeb  dominantly 
suppressed  dNf1  growth,  associative 
learning,  and  neuronal  ERK  over-
activation  phenotypes,  which,  together 
with  other  results,  suggests  a  role  for 
dAlk  as  a  rate-limiting  activator  of 
functionally 
important  dNf1-regulated 
neuronal  RAS/ERK  signals.13  The  fact 
that attenuation of dAlk signaling rescues 
multiple  dNf1  defects  raises  important 
questions  whether  NF1-regulated  ALK/
RAS/ERK  signaling 
in 
man, and whether ALK should be further 
investigated  as  a  therapeutic  target  in 
NF1. Several observations suggest positive 
answers  to  both  questions.  Thus,  as  we 
previously  found  for  dAlk  and  dNf1,13

the  expression  of  Alk  and  Nf1  in  the 
mouse nervous system overlaps to a large 
extent.22,23  Supporting  an  evolutionary 
conserved  functional  link  between  both 
proteins,  mutations  that  activate  ALK  or 
that  block  the  expression  of  NF1  have 
both  been  implicated  in  neuroblastoma 
tumorigenesis.24,25 Adding to this indirect 
evidence,  our  recent  study  found  that 
shRNA-mediated  suppression  of  NF1 
expression renders human neuroblastoma 
cells  resistant  to  pharmacological  ALK 
inhibition.14  Specifically,  we  used  two 
human  neuroblastoma  lines  harboring 
constitutively 
F1174L  ALK 
alleles.  Both  lines  are  highly  sensitive 
to  pharmacological  inhibition  of  ALK 
with  either  NVP-TAE684  or  Crizotinib.
