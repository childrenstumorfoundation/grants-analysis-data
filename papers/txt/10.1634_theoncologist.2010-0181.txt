ABSTRACT
Introduction. Neurofibromatosis 1 is a tumor predispo-
sition genetic syndrome with autosomal dominant inher-
itance and virtually 100% penetrance by the age of 5
years. NF1 results from a loss-of-function mutation in
the NF1 gene, resulting in decreased levels of neurofi-
bromin in the cell. Neurofibromin is a negative regulator
of various intracellular signaling pathways involved in
the cellular proliferation. Although the loss of heterozy-
gosity in the NF1 gene may predispose NF1 patients to
certain malignancies, additional genetic alterations are
a prerequisite for their development. The precise nature
of these additional genetic alterations is not well defined,
and genetic testing of all malignancies in NF1 patients
becomes an essential component of future research in
this subset of patients. In addition to germline NF1 mu-
tations, alteration of the somatic NF1 gene is associated

with sporadic malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of
the colon, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic as-
trocytoma.

Materials and Methods. A comprehensive English and
non-English language search for all articles pertinent to ma-
lignancies associated with NF1 was conducted using PubMed,
a search engine provided by the U.S. National Library of
Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Key words
searched included the following: “malignancies associated
with NF1”, “tumors associated with NF1”, and “NF1 and ma-
lignancies”. A comprehensive analysis in terms age and mode
of presentation, investigation and therapeutic modalities, and
outcome of the published data was performed and compared
with similar information on the sporadic cases.

Results. Malignancies in NF1 patients typically occur
at an earlier age and, with an exception of optic pathway

gliomas, certain types of malignancies carry a poor
prognosis compared with their sporadic counterparts.
Malignancies are the leading cause of death in NF1 pa-
tients, resulting in a 10- to 15-year decreased life expec-
tancy compared with the general population.

Conclusions. The lack of well-defined screening tests
for early detection and the nonspecific clinical presenta-
tion contributes to a poorer outcome in malignancies as-

sociated with NF1. Small study group size, mixed patient
population, and a lack of uniformity in reporting re-
search results make comparison of treatment outcome
for this group difficult. An International Consensus
Meeting to address and recommend best practices for
screening, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of ma-
lignancies associated with NF1 is needed. The Oncologist

INTRODUCTION
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic
syndromes affecting all racial and ethnic groups, with a prev-
alence of 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 persons [1]. NF1 has an auto-
somal dominant inheritance with 100% penetrance and
variable degrees of expression [2]. The phenotype of uniquely
affected individuals may vary, but the cardinal manifestations
of NF1 are multiple cafe´ au lait spots, cutaneous neurofibro-
mas, and Lisch nodules of the iris [3]. The clinical diagnosis of
NF1 is based on criteria established by the National Institutes
of Health Consensus Development Conference in 1987 (Table
1). The diagnosis of NF1 is confirmed when at least 2 of the 7
criteria are identified [4]. Note that most clinical manifesta-
tions cited are not exclusive to NF1; however, axillary freck-
ling and Lisch nodules can be considered pathognomonic of
NF1 [5, 6]. Although NF1 typically runs a benign clinical
course, unique malignancies associated with NF1 are the most
common cause of death in this group and reduce average life
expectancy by 10 –15 years [7].

GENETICS
Neurofibromatosis 1 results from a loss-of-function mutation
in the NF1 gene localized to chromosome band 17q11.2, and
comprised of 60 exons and 350 kb of genomic DNA [8]. More
than 500 different NF1 mutations have been identified, of
which most are unique to a particular kindred [9]. The protein
product of NF1, neurofibromin, is known to activate ras
GTPase, which promotes the hydrolysis of active ras-GTP to
inactive ras-GDP [10 –14]. Reduction (in haploinsufficient
cells) or complete loss (in cells that have also lost function of
the normal NF1 allele) of neurofibromin leads to activation
of ras signal transduction pathway, which regulates a cascade
of downstream signaling pathways, including mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB), and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Activation of these pathways re-
sults in a variety of cellular effects that generally stimulate cel-
lular proliferation and survival [15].

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS 1 AND MALIGNANCY
Patients with NF1 harbor an increased risk for developing both
benign and malignant tumors. Overall, NF1 patients have 2.7-
fold increased cancer risk with a cumulative risk of 20% in af-
fected patients ⬎50 years of age [16]. The incidence of
malignancy varies between 4% and 52% in NF1 patients (Ta-
ble 2) [17, 18]. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are

criteria for establishing a diagnosis of NF1 关4兴
The diagnosis of NF1 is rendered when two or more of
the following are present:
1. Six or more cafe´-au-lait spots

● 1.5 cm or larger in postpubertal individuals
● 0.5 cm or larger in prepubertal individuals

2. Two or more neurofibromas of any type OR one or
more plexiform neurofibromas

the most common malignant tumors observed in NF1 patients
[1, 19, 20]. Other malignant tumors strongly associated with
NF1 patients include rhabdomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, neuroectodermal tumors, pheochromocyto-
mas, and breast carcinoma (Table 3) [20]. In addition to germ-
line NF1 mutations, somatic alteration of the NF1 gene is also
associated with sporadic malignancies such as small cell car-
cinoma of lung, adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum,
ovarian epithelial and serous carcinomas, myelodysplastic
syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma (Table 3). Cancer is the
most common cause of death in individuals affected with NF1
and results in a 10- to 15-year decreased life expectancy [7].
The proportional mortality due to malignancy in NF1 patients
⬍40 years is more than twofold and for patients ⬎40 years it is
between 0.77 and 1.18 (Fig. 1) [7]. The proportional mortality
for different age groups of NF1 patients is mainly dependent
on variations in incidence of malignancies in those age groups.
Overall malignant neoplasms occurred more frequently in NF1
patients ⬍39 years of age compared with patients ⬎40 years of
age [7].

Individuals with NF1 are heterozygous for an NF1 muta-
tion, in the sense they have one normal and one mutated copy
of the NF1 gene. Mutation in the normal copy of the NF1 gene
(loss of heterozygosity, LOH) is a prerequisite for the devel-
opment of malignancies in NF1 patients [21]. In addition to

LOH, development of specific tumors typically requires addi-
tional genetic alterations (Table 3). In addition, the association
between certain neoplasms and Neurofibromatosis 1 is based
on observed increased prevalence in NF1 patients compared
with the general population, but specific reasons explaining
these associations are not clear. Furthermore, the reported
prevalence of different neoplasms in the NF1 patients varies
across different age groups and continents (Table 2). As dis-

Age groups

Figure 1. Proportional mortality rate (PMR) was calculated for
malignancy-related deaths in NF1 patients. There were 3,770
cases of presumed NF1 among 32,722,122 deaths in the United
States between 1983 and 1997. Overall PMR for malignancy in
NF1 patients was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 –1.28).
From the graph it can be seen that the PMR due to malignancy in
NF1 patients aged under 40 years is ⬎2 and for patients older than
40 years it is between 0.77 and 1.18. PMR is highest (6.07; 95% CI
4.88 –7.45) for persons who died at 10 –19 years of age, followed
by (4.93; 95% CI 4.14 –5.82) for those who died at 20 –29 years of
age [7].

cussed above, loss of heterozygosity in the NF1 gene certainly
increases the risk of developing a neoplasm in NF1 patients but
these mutations are also observed in some of the sporadic tu-
mors. Hence it becomes difficult to ascertain a true relation be-
tween these tumor types with Neurofibromatosis 1, unless an
additional mutation(s) specific for NF1 patients is identified.

MALIGNANT TUMORS ASSOCIATED WITH NF1
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs; neurofi-
brosarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma, malignant neurolemmoma,
malignant schwannoma, and anaplastic neurofibroma) are
neurogenic sarcomas which can arise from any peripheral
nerve cell (or cell showing nerve sheath differentiation), with
the exception of tumors originating within the perineurium or
the peripheral nerve vasculature [22]. MPNSTs can arise in
any part of the body but are most common in the proximal por-
tions of the upper and lower extremities and the trunk [23–25].
MPNSTs account for 3%–10% of all soft tissue sarcomas with
15% to 70% occurring in NF1 patients [26]. The incidence of
MPNSTs in NF1 patients is 2%–29% compared with 0.001%
in the general population [23, 27, 28]. The cumulative risk of
developing MPNSTs in NF1 patients during their lifetime is
8%–13% and it remains the leading cause of death in this group
[1]. MPNSTs in NF1 patients commonly arise from pre-exist-
ing plexiform neurofibromas and subcutaneous/spinal nerve
root neurofibromas, but never within cutaneous neurofibroma
[29]. The risk of developing MPNSTs is increased 3-fold in the
presence of subcutaneous neurofibromas and 20-fold in the
presence of internal plexiform neurofibromatosis [30]. From

Patil and Chamberlain

105

10% to 50% of MPNSTs result from malignant transformation
of plexiform neurofibromas [31, 32].

Pathologically, MPNSTs are spindle cell tumors that
arise from Schwann cells. Mature Schwann cells stain pos-
itive on immunohistochemical stains for S-100 marker, but
this staining may be absent in 50% of MPNSTs because of
dedifferentiation [26]. In addition to LOH in NF1, muta-
tions in TP53 and deletions of the CDKN2A genes are seen
in the tumor cells of subgroups of patients with MPNSTs.
NF1 microdeletions lead to twofold increased risk for de-
veloping MPNSTs [33]. Malignant triton tumors, MPNST
with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation or other divergent
differentiation, are rarely seen in NF1 patients [34].
MPNSTs often metastasize widely by a hematogenous
route, heralding a poor prognosis [23, 29], and the most
common sites of metastasis are the lung and bone [24, 35].
MPNSTs are found primarily in adults (in the third to
sixth decade of life) and occurrence in childhood and ado-
lescence is uncommon. The mean age of patients with NF1-
associated MPNST is approximately a decade younger than
that in sporadic cases (Table 4). The male/female ratio var-
ies from 0.7:1 to 2.7:1 in different studies [23, 36 – 41]. The
initial complaint is typically an enlarging mass or pain in the
involved site [23, 24, 36, 42, 43]. Persistent pain that dis-
turbs sleep, rapid increase in size, change in texture from
soft to hard, and new or unexplained neurologic deficits
should suggest malignant transformation of a pre-existing
neurofibroma [29]. MPNSTs are difficult to diagnose as the
clinical and radiologic features are shared by benign neuro-
fibromas and plexiform neurofibromas. Accurate diagnosis
can be made only by a combination of histopathologic and
immunohistochemical evaluation [23]. Magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging of MPNSTs typically shows a nonspecific
heterogeneous mass with ill-defined margins with greater
uptake of gallium-67 citrate compared with benign lesions
[44]. Ferner et al. have shown that fluorine-18 labeled fluo-
rodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
has a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 95% for the di-
agnosis of MPNSTs in NF1 patients. The mean SUV was
5.7 for MPNSTs compared with 1.5 for plexiform neurofi-
bromas. No malignant tumors had an SUV ⬍2.5 [45]. Those
authors recommend that symptomatic neurofibromas with
an SUV ⬎3.5 should be excised and lesions with SUVmax
between 2.5 and 3.5 should be followed with FDG-PET-CT
every 3 months [45].

The treatment and management principles of MPNSTs are
similar to other soft tissue sarcomas [46]. Complete resection
with negative resection margins (R0) is the treatment of
choice. Resectability is dependent on anatomical location and
ranges from 20% in paraspinal MPNST to 95% in tumors of
the extremity [23, 24, 41, 47– 49]. In a review of 134 patients
(32 patients with NF1), Wong et al. reported a 5-year survival
of 57% for patients in whom R0 resection was achieved com-
pared with 22% for patients with a positive resection margins
(R1). An international consensus statement on the manage-
ment of MPNSTs in NF1 recommends adjuvant radiation ther-
apy (RT) for all intermediate- to high-grade tumors and for all

www.TheOncologist.com

low-grade tumors with positive resection margins [49]. Che-
motherapy (CT) is reserved for metastatic or unresectable tu-
mors [29, 50]. In general, MPNSTs in NF1 have a poorer
prognosis compared with sporadic cases [23, 27, 51–53]. The
overall 5-year survival of patients with NF1-associated
MPNSTs is in the range of 16%–38% compared with 42%–
57% for sporadic cases (Table 4). MPNSTs are highly aggres-
sive and achieving local control can be difficult [50] as they
have the highest local recurrence rate of all sarcomas [54]. Lo-
cal recurrence has been reported in 18.8%–21% of NF1 pa-
tients with MPNSTs (Table 4). Tumor size ⬎5 cm, high tumor
grade, central location of the tumors, and adjuvant radiation
therapy are factors associated with poor prognosis on multi-
variate analysis [36].

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common
nonepithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting
for 1%–3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies [55]. GISTs
can arise from any part of the gastrointestinal tract; however,
the most commonly affected site in NF1 patients is the small
intestine compared with the stomach in the general population
[56, 57]. Patients with NF1 are at 45-fold increased risk of de-
veloping GISTs compared with normal controls. The inci-
dence of GIST in NF1 patients is 3.9%–25% compared with
10 –13 per 100,000 in the general population [57, 58]. Most no-
tably, the prevalence of NF1 in patients with GIST is up to 6%
[57].

Pathologically, GISTs are mesenchymal tumors that
arise from the interstitial cell of Cajal [59 – 61]. LOH of the
NF1 gene, and mutation in the proto-oncogene c-kit which
lead to increased expression of KIT and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-alpha (PGDFRA), are thought to be
pivotal to GIST development. GISTs in NF1 patients have
wild-type KIT receptors (type III tyrosine kinase receptor)
that signal through the MAP kinase pathway [62] compared
with PI3K-AKT cascade used by sporadic GISTs [63, 64].
The later finding points toward different pathogenesis and
differential response to imatinib for GISTs associated with
NF1. GISTs are classified into three histologic subtypes: (a)
spindle cell type (70%), (b) epithelioid type (20%), and (c)
mixed spindle cell and epithelioid cell type [65]. Spindle
cell variety is more common in NF1-associated GISTs
(80%) [56]. On immunohistochemical staining, 95% are
positive for CD117, 70% for CD34, and 40% for smooth
muscle actin [56]. GISTs spread by the hematogeneous
route, with the most common sites of metastases being the
liver, lung, peritoneum, and lymph nodes [66].

NF1 patients with GISTs tend to present at a younger age
(median age 50 years) than sporadic cases (median age 55 to 65
years) [67]. The male:female ratio varies from 0.9:1 to 1:1.4 in
different studies [55, 56, 58, 68]. GISTs are generally asymp-
tomatic and only 5% present with symptoms [58]. The most
common symptoms are nonspecific abdominal pain, bleeding,
perforation, and rarely gastrointestinal obstruction (due to in-
traluminal growth, intussusception, and volvulus) [68 –70].
Symptomatic patients tend to have high and intermediate risk

tumors as well as distant metastasis at presentation [66]. There
are no radiologic signs specific for GISTs, although on com-
puted tomography they may appear as an inhomogeneous mass
caused by areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with peripheral
contrast enhancement of the viable tumor [71].

Information on therapeutic options in NF1 with GISTs is
limited; published reports on management of sporadic GISTs
suggest surgical resection as the treatment of choice for GISTs
and biological therapy (imatinib) is recommended for patients
with unresectable or metastatic disease, or in the adjuvant set-
ting for high-risk GISTs [65]. Of note, as discussed below,
imatinib is not considered standard for NF1 patients. In gen-
eral, the surgical treatment of GIST involves a wedge resection
of the involved gastric area or a segmental resection of the
small intestinal tumors. More extensive resections may be re-
quired for tumors involving the esophagus, duodenum, or rec-
tum [65]. Mussi et al. reported on a cohort of 28 NF1 patients
with GISTs. Five patients (17.9%) in this group had metastasis
at the time of diagnosis [66]. All patients underwent resection
as initial treatment, two of whom had only debulking surgery

in view of peritoneal metastasis. Four patients were treated
with imatinib adjuvantly for high GISTs following R0 resec-
tion. The 5-year disease-specific survival and event-free sur-
vival were 54.3% and 46.9%, respectively. Response to
imatinib was poor in this group. Three of the four patients ex-
hibited progressive disease and only one achieved a temporary
stabilization of disease. All four patients died of disease within
2 years of beginning therapy. Poor response of NF1-associated
GISTs to imatinib therapy has been similarly documented by
others [72, 73].

Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a non-neurogenic sarcoma that
accounts for almost 5% of all childhood cancers [74 –76]. The
prevalence of RMS in NF1-affected children is 1.4%– 6%,
which is 20-fold increased risk compared with non-NF1 chil-
dren [77– 81]. The urogenital system is the most common an-
atomic site involved [81].

Pathologically, RMS comprises small round blue cell tu-
mors that arise from neural crest cells [82]. In addition to a

Patil and Chamberlain

107

LOH in NF1, mutations in TP53 and a t (2; 13) translocation
corresponding to a PAX3-FKHR gene fusion and t (1; 13)
translocation corresponding to a PAX7-FKHR gene fusion are
recognized in the pathogenesis of RMS [83, 84].

RMS occurs most commonly in the pediatric NF1 patients
with a male/female ratio of 1.5:1 [81]. RMS most commonly
presents as a palpable mass or with symptoms reflecting the
presence of a mass. There are no radiologic features specific
for RMS and histopathology of the biopsied or resected spec-
imen provides confirmative diagnosis.

The management of RMS has varied over the years and a
detailed discussion of treatment is beyond the scope of this re-
view. Two large study groups have recommended a conserva-
tive approach with surgery performed if the tumor can be
resected without significant effect on cosmesis and function.
Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation may have a role in select
patient groups [74, 85].

Carcinoid Tumor
Carcinoid tumors are neuroendocrine tumors arising from mu-
cosal or submucosal endocrine cells, primarily within the gas-
trointestinal
tract or lungs, but may also involve the
mediastinum, thymus, bronchus, pancreas, liver, kidneys, tes-
ticles, ovaries, and prostate [86]. Carcinoids occur in 1% of
NF1 patients, and involve the periampullary region almost ex-
clusively [87, 88] with a prevalence of 27.5% compared with
2–3 per 100,000 in the general population [89 –91]. Soma-
tostatinoma is the most commonly reported subtype in NF1 pa-
tients, a majority of which (40%) are localized in the
periampullary region [92, 93]. In NF1 patients carcinoids may
be associated with adenocarcinomas [94], gastrointestinal stro-
mal tumors [95, 96], and pheochromocytomas [97, 98]. This
discussion will be limited to the diagnosis and management of
periampullary carcinoids in NF1 patients.

Pathologically, carcinoids are enterochromafin and argen-
tafin positive tumors derived from stem cells and orthotopic
neuroendocrine cells of the epithelium of the respective organs
[99]. A variety of genetic alterations are associated with carci-
noids, most notably 18q and 11q chromosomal losses [86]. In
particular, somatostatinomas are positive for neuron-specific
enolase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin on immunohis-
tochemical staining [100].

NF1 patients with carcinoids typically are 21–70 years
of age compared with 40 –70 years of age in sporadic cases
[91, 96]. NF1-associated carcinoids are more common in fe-
males (1:1.5) [96] and African Americans (87.5%) [87, 101,
102]. Periampullary carcinoids generally present with jaun-
dice (65%) and nonspecific abdominal pain (31%) [103].
Less common clinical presentations include melena, iron
deficiency anemia, gastrointestinal obstruction, cholangitis,
and pancreatitis [86, 104, 105]. The occurrence of the so-
matostatinoma syndrome (diabetes, diarrhea, and gall-
stones) is extremely rare [106, 107]. Although clinical
diagnosis is based on symptoms, biochemical confirmation
is necessary [86]. Biochemical markers such as 5-hydroxy
indolacetic acid (5-IHAA) and chromogranin A have high
specificity and predictive value for diagnosing carcinoids

[108]. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy along with ERCP
is helpful in the evaluation of biliary obstruction and deter-
mining the extent of common bile duct involvement. Biopsy
of a suspicious lesion and sphincterotomy and stenting can
be performed at the same time [90]. Endoscopic ultrasonog-
raphy has a high sensitivity in localizing gastric or duodenal
carcinoids and can detect lesions as small as 2–3 mm [109,
110]. CT scan and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pro-
vide an important means for initial localization and detec-
tion of metastasis. Unfortunately, accurate preoperative
diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy is achieved in only 15% of
ampullary NETs [90]. The hallmark features of carcinoids
on CT and MR imaging are the presence of radiating strands
of fibrosis and spiculation, especially in the presence of a
mass lesion [111]. Octreotide scan (Octreoscan) detects so-
matostatin receptor 2 (SSTR 2) and SSTR 5 positive carci-
noids. The median tumor detection rate and sensitivity for
Octreoscan are 89% and 84%, respectively, compared with
80% for CT and MR imaging [112]. In the evaluation of car-
cinoids FDG-PET-CT has been used in sporadic instances,
but its clinical significance remains uncertain [113, 114].

The treatment of periampullary carcinoids is surgical re-
section whenever possible [95]. In carcinoids associated with
NF1, pancreaticoduodenectomy was required in 60% of pa-
tients with a median survival of 14.5 months (range 4 to 60
months). The outcome of periampullary carcinoids in NF1 pa-
tients is less clear; so far, only 2 of the 32 published cases have
reported a death in their patients during follow-up [95].

Pheochromocytoma
Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is a catecholamine-secreting tumor
of the adrenal medulla or other sites within the sympathetic
nervous system. NF1-associated PCC are solitary and unilat-
eral in the majority of patients (84%), but may be bilateral
(9.6%) or extraadrenal (6.1%) [115]. The incidence of PCC in
NF1 patients is 0.1%–5.7% compared with 2– 8 per 100,000 in
the general population [115, 116]. Notably, the incidence of
PCC increases up to 20%–50% in NF1 patients with hyperten-
sion [115]. PCC in NF1 patients is usually benign, and malig-
nant PCC accounts for only 11.5% of reported cases [115]. In
rare cases, composite tumors of pheochromocytoma and gan-
glioneuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma may occur in NF1 pa-
tients [117].

The mean age of presentation for NF1-associated PCC is
42 years compared with 47 years for sporadic cases with a
male/female ratio of 1:1.4 [115, 118]. Symptoms related to
PCC like headache, palpitations, diaphoresis, anxiety, and
hypertension are seen in 61% of patients with NF1-associ-
ated PCC [115]. Diagnosis of PCC requires both biochem-
ical confirmation and tumor localization using imaging
modalities [119]. Plasma-free metanephrine level is the
screening test of choice for PCC [120, 121]. Plasma meta-
nephrine level of ⬍61 ng/L excludes PCC, whereas values
⬎236 ng/L confirm the diagnosis of PCC and values be-
tween 6 and 236 ng/L require additional testing [122]. In the
evaluation of PCC, plasma-free metanephrines, plasma total
metanephrines, and urinary fractionated metanephrines

108

NF1-Associated Neoplasms

have equal sensitivity and specificity [123]. Most cases of
PCC show high attenuation values (⬎10 Hounsfield units)
on CT scan, with hyperintensity on T2 MRI and gadolinium
contrast enhancement on T1 MRI [124]. The sensitivity and
specificity of CT and MR imaging in localizing PCC range
from 88% to 100% and from 96% to 100%, respectively
[124 –126]. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintig-
raphy is shown to have a higher specificity but lower sensi-
tivity compared with MR imaging [127]. 18F-labeled
dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET scan is a newer
diagnostic technique with sensitivity similar to that of MR
imaging and specificity of 100% in localizing PCC [127].
Surgery is curative for benign PCC with a 5-year survival
of 95% [128]. Chemotherapy may be indicated for patients
with metastatic pheochromocytoma, but its efficacy is not sup-
ported by large randomized controlled trials [129]. Malignant
PCC has an unpredictable outcome; approximately half of
these patients exhibit a rapid downhill course with death due to
disease within 4 –5 years [130]. However, the remaining pa-
tients have an indolent course with an occasional patient sur-
viving ⬎20 years even in the absence of cytotoxic therapy
[130]. Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
dacarbazine (CVD) is associated with an overall 5-year sur-
vival of ⬃50% with a complete response rate of 11% and a par-
tial response rate of 44% in the setting of metastases [130].
Radiopharmaceutical therapy with 131I-MIBG results in a 75%
to 90% symptomatic response with tumor response rates in the
range of 30% to 47% [131]. The role of additional therapeutic
modalities such as radiation therapy, cryoablation, radiofre-
quency ablation, and transcatheter arterial embolization is in-
vestigational [128].

Optic Pathway Gliomas
Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are the most common intracra-
nial tumors in patients with NF1 [132]. Although these tumors
may arise anywhere along the optic pathway, the most com-
mon site in NF1 patients is the anterior optic pathway com-
pared with the posterior optic pathways in sporadic cases
[133–135]. Optic pathway tumors account for nearly 2%–5%
of all brain tumors in the pediatric population with 70% of
these occurring in patients with NF1 [132]. The prevalence of
OPGs in NF1 patients varies widely from 1.55% reported in a
population-based study [136] to 58% seen in some referral
centers [137–142]. The incidence of OPGs in NF1 patients is
probably between 1.5% and 7.5% [132]. NF1-associated
OPGs that typically demonstrate indolent clinical behavior
[143–147] generally manifest early in childhood and rarely
grow or cause symptoms after the first decade of life [148 –
151].

Pathologically, OPGs are low-grade pilocytic astrocyto-
mas with low growth potential possibly arising from small
clusters of proliferating immature progenitors. NF1 inactiva-
tion in the progenitor cells is thought to play a major role in the
development of these tumors [152–154]. OPGs are positive for
astroglial progenitor cell markers (brain lipid-binding protein
and nestin) along with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) on
immunohistochemical stains [152–154].

NF1 patients ⬍6 years of age are at the greatest risk for de-
veloping OPGs; however, presentation in adulthood has been
reported [132, 148]. The male/female ratio varies from 1.6:1 to
2:1 [133, 139]. The majority (50%–75%) of patients are
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [134, 139]. Nearly 8%–
52% of OPGs show either clinical or radiologic progression af-
ter their initial diagnosis [155]. The progression usually occurs
within 2 years of initial diagnosis [155]. On the other hand,
progression of tumor has been noted to occur as late as 5 years
after initial diagnosis [156]. Grill et al. observed 20 (18.8%)
patients with clinically silent optic pathway glioma, of which
12 (11.8%) patients developed progressive disease within 16.5
months, warranting treatment [146]. Clinical presentation de-
pends on the location and extent of the tumor with intraorbital
tumors presenting with proptosis, and optic chiasm and hypo-
thalamic tumors presenting with vision loss and precocious pu-
berty [134, 139, 157–160]. The most common clinical signs in
NF1 patients are decreased visual acuity, decreased visual
fields, and proptosis [161, 162]. In view of the indolent and un-
predictable course of OPGs, it is difficult to recommend spe-
cific investigational
strategy
applicable to all patients [155]. The majority of OPGs display
a stable course, but some may undergo rapid progression or
spontaneous or biopsy-related regression with or without clin-
ical improvement [143, 149, 163, 164]. Although a few authors
have proposed diagnostic and management algorithms for
OPGs, their clinical utility is not fully established [20, 150].
Annual systematic ophthalmologic examination until age 6,
and at longer intervals thereafter, is indicated in all children di-
agnosed with NF1 [132]. Routine screening with radiologic
imaging is not indicated as incidentally discovered OPGs
rarely require treatment [165]. Visual-evoked potential (VEP)
is recommended as a good screening tool by some authors and
has a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 86% for diagnos-
ing OPGs, although its use is discouraged by “Consensus
Statement from the NF1 Optic Pathway Glioma task Force
(1997)” [166, 167]. Flicker VEP (F-VEP) and Sweep VEP are
two modifications of the standard VEP, which may offer in-
creased information about the neurophysiologic status of pa-
tients with OPGs. Agreement between F-VEP and MRI
changes is approximately 78.9% (p ⬍.001) [166]. Falsini et al.
have recommended that F-VEP be used for both screening and
in follow-up of all patients with OPGs [166].

schema or management

Symptomatic lesions that cause visual impairment, hypo-
thalamic dysfunction, and hydrocephalus should be treated
[168]. Treatment options for patients younger than 7 years in-
clude either surgery or chemotherapy with radiotherapy re-
served for patients ⬎10 years. Treatment recommendations for
patients between 7 and 10 years old are controversial [156].
The selection of appropriate management strategy for each in-
dividual patient should be based on tumor location, histology,
and evolution, and also patient age [140]. Surgery offers a de-
finitive cure for most intraorbital and anterior optic pathway
tumors, whereas resection of the posterior optic pathway tu-
mors is associated with high rates of recurrence and/or pro-
gression [140]. Noncurative debulking surgery is undertaken
to preserve visual function in rapidly growing tumors, to obtain

quick relief of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and in cases
where adjuvant therapies are ineffective [169]. Marsupializa-
tion of cystic tumor into the ventricular system or CSF shunt-
ing may also be performed when tumors are associated with
high ICP [169]. Deliganis et al. reported on 16 patients with
NF1-associated OPGs: 5 patients were managed conserva-
tively, 1 patient was treated with surgery alone, and 10 patients
were treated with radiation therapy with or without surgery.
The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 93%, 81%, and
81%, respectively [170]. In a similar study, Thiagalingam et al.
reported on 17 patients with NF1-associated OPGs. Five pa-
tients were treated with surgery, 7 patients with radiation ther-
apy, 2 patients with chemotherapy, and 3 patients with
combined therapy. Post-treatment, 53.7% of patients had mild
or no visual impairment, 14.8% had moderate impairment, and
31.5% had severe impairment in their worse eye. The majority
of patients expressed only mild or no impairment in the better
eye (83.3%) [162]. At present, chemotherapy has replaced ra-
diation therapy as a first-line treatment for evolving or slow-
growing OPGs [169]. Carboplatin and vincristine are the most
commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, with overall re-
sponse rates between 25% and 73% [132, 155, 156, 169]. Ad-
ditional chemotherapeutic agents have been used for the
treatment of OPGs, including temozolomide, procarbazine,
vincristine, 6-thioguanine, and chloroethylcyclohexylnitro-
sourea (CCNU; lomustine). However, the use of alkylating
agents and multidrug regimens in children with NF1 runs the
theoretical risk for the development of secondary malignancies
[169, 171, 172]. Between 31% and 42.8% of tumors fail to re-
spond to chemotherapy, with treatment failure more common
among the posterior OPGs [173, 174]. Radiation therapy is
mainly indicated for progressive or recurrent OPGs in patients
⬎10 years of age [169]. The long-term adverse effects of radi-
ation therapy include learning disabilities, growth retardation,
radiation-induced neoplasms, optic neuropathy, precocious
puberty, and delayed vascular occlusion [146, 175–177].
These effects are particularly common in infants and young
(⬍7 years) children, hence, the caveat to restrict radiation to
patients older than 10 years [169]. OPGs are extremely radia-
tion-sensitive and tumor control is achievable in 80%–90% of
patients [146] and a 3-year progression-free survival is achiev-
able in 70%–100% of patients [169].

Brainstem Gliomas
Brainstem gliomas are the second most common intracranial
tumors in patients with NF1 [148]. Brainstem gliomas account
for nearly 15%–20% of all brain tumors in the pediatric popu-
lation and the incidence varies from 4% to 20% in NF1 patients
[178, 179]. The medulla oblongata (68%) is the most common
site in NF1 patients compared with the pons in sporadic cases
(80%) [180, 181]. NF1-associated brainstem gliomas typically
demonstrate an indolent clinical behavior compared with spo-
radic cases [181, 182].

Diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas (21%) are the most
common brainstem astrocytomas in NF1 patients, followed by
low-grade astrocytomas of indeterminate type (17%) and pilo-
cytic astrocytomas (12%) [183]. Neurofibromin, a protein

www.TheOncologist.com

product of NF1 gene, inhibits proliferation of astrocytes di-
rectly and through negative regulation of p21-ras protein.
Hence, loss of heterozygosity of the NF1 gene results in in-
creased proliferation of astrocytes [184].

The mean age at the diagnosis of brainstem gliomas in NF1
patients is 7.8 – 8.4 years (⬍1 month to 17 years); however,
presentation in adulthood has been reported [180, 185, 186].
The male/female ratio varies from 2.1:1 to 3.3:1 [180, 185].
The majority (52.3%–76.4%) of patients are symptomatic at
presentation, with headache being the most common symptom
(36%–53%) [180, 185, 187]. Neurologic signs depend on the
lesion location; however, gross motor abnormality, cranial
neuropathies, and dysarthria are most common [180, 185].

Similar to OPGs, the majority of brainstem gliomas display
a stable course, but some may undergo rapid progression or
spontaneous regression. Although clinical progression occurs
in only 14.3%–17.6% of NF1 patients with brainstem gliomas,
radiologic progression is observed in 35.3%– 42.9% [180,
185]. Pollack et al. have recommend a baseline neuroimaging
study in all NF1 patients before the age of 5 years with a repeat
study after 2–3 years if the child is too young for detailed eval-
uation [187]. Note that it is probably not cost-effective to per-
form neuroimaging in all NF1 patients, as only 9.1% of
patients will harbor occult intracranial lesions that require
further surgery [187]. Once a brainstem mass is identified, a
neurologic examination every 3 months with biannual neuro-
imaging for the first year to rule out tumor progression or hy-
drocephalus is indicated. Subsequent neurologic examination
and neuroimaging should be performed annually [185].

Gliomas that exhibit rapid growth, become symptomatic,
or demonstrate contrast enhancement on neuroimaging should
be treated [179, 182]. Treatment of NF1-associated brainstem
glioma and sporadic brainstem glioma is no different. Acces-
sible lesions, such as dorsally exophytic brainstem tumors, cer-
vicomedullary junction lesions, and superficial tegmental
lesions are treated with surgical resection. Tumors deemed un-
resectable, or in the event of tumor recurrence, may be treated
with whole brain or stereotactic radiotherapy. Chemotherapy
has modest efficacy for unresectable low-grade gliomas and
may be preferable as initial treatment for patients younger than
5 years. A variety of regimens have been utilized (e.g., vincris-
tine-actinomycin D, carboplatinum-vincristine, and 6-thiogua-
nine-procarbazine-dibromodulcitol-CCNU-vincristine) with
tumor response rates of 20%– 80% and response or stabiliza-
tion rates of 75%–100% [187].

Molloy et al. reported on 17 NF1 patients with brainstem
gliomas: 10 (58.8%) patients were managed conservatively, 7
(41.2%) required placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt,
and 2 (11.8%) underwent partial resection of a medulary tu-
mor. Only three NF1 patients (17%) received chemotherapy
and/or radiation. This group experienced an 11.8% mortality
(N ⫽ 2) and a 5.8% (N ⫽ 1) tumor progression rate at a mean
follow-up of 63 months [185]. In a separate study of 21 NF1
patients with brainstem glioma, 12 (57%) NF1 patients had
symptomatic lesions, of which 5 (23.8%) required a ventricu-
loperitoneal shunt and 7 (33.3%) were managed expectantly.

110

NF1-Associated Neoplasms

There were no mortalities in this group at a follow-up of 3.7
years [187].

Although brainstem gliomas associated with NF1 are
known to have better outcomes compared with sporadic brain-
stem gliomas, 5- and 10-year mortality rates as high as 30%
and 37%, respectively, have been reported [183]. Age ⬍10
years, asymptomatic tumors, diffusely infiltrating astrocyto-
mas, focally enhancing tumors, and a tectal location are indi-
cators of good prognosis [148, 183, 187].

Leukemia
Children with NF1 have a 500-fold increased risk of develop-
ing myeloid malignancies compared with the general popula-
tion [188]. In a population-based study, Stiller et al. reported a
200-fold increased risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(CMML)/juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) in
children, a 5-fold increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL), and a 10-fold increased risk for acute lymphocytic leu-
kemia (ALL) across all the NF1-affected age groups [189].
Bader et al. reported reversal of the ratio between ALL and
nonlymphocytic leukemia from 4:1 in the general population
to 9:20 in patients with NF1 [190]. Rare subtypes like chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myelomonocytic
(AMML) are also commonly seen in NF1 patients [190].

In at least half of affected NF1 patients, LOH of the NF1
gene is detected, resulting in uncontrolled activation of the ras
signal transduction pathway [188, 191]. NF1 is a tumor sup-
pressor gene whose product negatively regulates ras signal
transduction. Ras signaling pathway activation by point muta-
tion in the RAS gene is a common event in acute myeloid ma-
lignancies and may account for the increased leukemia in NF1
patients [192–197].

The average age of NF1 children at the time of diagnosis
was 32 months for JCML, 86 months for ALL, and 79 months
for NHL, with a male/female ratio of 1.6:1 [189]. The median
survival was 5 months for NF1-associated JCML, 52 months
for ALL, and 13.5 months for NHL. Notably, the prognosis of
NF1-associated leukemia and NF1-associated NHL does not
differ from that of sporadic cases [189].

Carcinoma Breast
Breast carcinoma among NF1 patients was reported by
Borberg et al. in 1951 [198]; since then, several additional
cases have been reported, mostly from Japan. There is a pau-
city of information on this topic in the English language; Mu-
rayama et al. have reported on 34 NF1 patients with 38 breast
cancers [199]. Sørensen et al. reported 57 non-neurologic ma-
lignancies in a cohort of 212 patients with NF1 [25]. In this
later cohort, breast cancer was the second most common ma-
lignancy (7 out of 57, 12.3%) after gastric cancer (12 out of 57,
21.1%) [25]. In a population-based study, Sharif et al. reported
a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.5 (95% CI 1.9 –5.9)
for carcinoma breast among NF1 patients [200].

NF1-associated breast cancer occurs more commonly in a
younger age group compared with the general population. Na-
kamura et al. reported that 18.5% of NF1-associated breast
cancer occurred in patients ⬍30 years old, which is more than

twice the number of patients with breast cancer of a similar age
group in the general population [201]. A similar increased in-
cidence in younger patients was observed by Sharif et al. with
a calculated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 4.9 (95% CI
2.4 – 8.8) for patients ⬍50 years of age [200]. So far, only a
single case of male breast cancer in an NF1 patient has been
reported [202]. In view of earlier age of onset and the clinical
difficulty in differentiating a breast lump from a cutaneous or
subcutaneous neurofibroma, it is recommended that all NF1
patients begin early screening and follow-up in specialized
centers.

The locus for BRCA1 on chromosome 17 is at a distance of
only 20 cM from the NF1 locus. This finding may account for
the increased incidence of breast carcinoma in NF1 patients
[203]. Ceccaroni et al. were the first to demonstrate BRCA1
mutations in a case of NF1-associated breast cancer [203]. Gu-
ran et al. have demonstrated LOH for NF1 in a case of NF1-
associated breast cancer, but failed to identify a BRCA
mutation [204]. In the United Kingdom, the most commonly
reported histologic subtypes of NF1-associated breast cancer
are invasive ductal carcinoma (77.8%), lobular carcinoma
(16.7%), and ductal carcinoma in situ (5.6%) [200], whereas in
Japan the most commonly reported histologic subtypes are in-
vasive ductal carcinoma (84.2%), mucinous carcinoma
(7.9%), lobular (2.6%), squamous cell carcinoma (2.6%), and
ductal carcinoma in situ (2.6%) [201].

The treatment of breast cancer in NF1 patients does not dif-
fer from sporadic forms and it is beyond the scope of this re-
view to discuss treatment further. In view of the rarity of this
entity and paucity of data in the English literature, it is difficult
to comment on the outcome of NF1-associated breast cancer.
Stage´ et al. have reported a recurrence-free survival of 14 years
following mastectomy for a patient with NF1-associated grade
II intraductal breast cancer [205]. On the other hand, Brasfield
et al. reported on five female NF1 patients with breast cancer
and all five died from breast cancer within 5 years of the diag-
nosis [206].

ADDITIONAL NF1-ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES
Several other malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of the
esophagus [207], stomach [208], colon [209, 210], small intes-
tine [211–216], pancreas [216, 217], gall bladder [218], and
bile ducts [219], as well as melanoma [220, 221], Wilm’s tu-
mor [222, 223], neuroblastoma [101, 224], and thyroid carci-
noma [206] have been reported in patients with NF1. It is
difficult to ascertain which of these are random occurrences or
may represent true associations with NF1. However, the in-
creased prevalence of these tumors in the general population
compared with NF1 patients suggests an incidental finding.
Having said that, adenocarcinoma of the small intestine in pa-
tients with NF1 may be an exception given the large number of
reported cases among NF1 patients [214]. The majority of
small intestinal adenocarcinoma occurring in patients with
NF1 are periampullary in location and this was discussed pre-
viously [212, 214]. Williams et al. have suggested that any as-
sociation between adenocarcinoma of the small intestine and
NF1 is tenuous at best given the established association be-

SOMATIC NF1 MUTATIONS
Mutations involving the NF1 gene in somatic cells have been
demonstrated in a variety of solid tumors. However, none of
the mutation types are specific for a group of tumors or a par-
ticular tumor type. Although mutations in the somatic NF1
gene locus have been found, the cause and effect relationship
has not been established; rather, there is a suggestion of an in-
terplay of this mutation with other genetic and environmental
factors that may lead to an increased risk of tumor develop-
ment. Table 3 summarizes the common somatic NF1 tumors
reported. In a pilot project to characterize cancer genomes,
Ding et al. conducted mutation analysis in 188 primary lung
adenocarcinomas [226]. Among the 26 significantly mutated
genes associated with adenocarcinoma of the lung, 16 muta-
tions involved the NF1 gene in 13 tumors. There were 4 non-
sense mutations, 5 splice-site mutations, and 1 frame shift
mutation in the NF1 coding region [226]. Reports on the type
of mutation involving NF1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma vary
widely; LOH involving NF1 gene may occur in 14%–57% of
colorectal carcinomas [227, 228]. Alhiquist et al. have reported
a gain in parts of or even complete duplication of the NF1 gene
in 17% of colorectal carcinomas [229]. Similarly, Cacev et al.
has also reported significant increase in the expression of NF1
mRNA in colorectal tumors compared with normal tissue
[230]. In a separate study, Furukawa et al. analyzed 37 patients
with primary lung cancer and identified NF1 mutations in three
patients, all of which had small cell lung carcinoma. All three
mutations identified were located in the GTPase-activating
protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) close to the mutational
hot spot within exon 24 [231]. Li et al. have reported three
cases of adenocarcinoma of the colon, myelodysplastic syn-
drome, and anaplastic astrocytoma, which also had NF1 mu-
tations involving the GRD domain [232]. Finally, Sangha et al.
reported reduced to absent NF1 in 5 out of 18 ovarian epithelial
cancer cell lines and 9 out of 41 primary ovarian serous carci-
nomas [233].

CONCLUSIONS
Neurofibromatosis 1 is a tumor predisposition genetic syn-
drome with autosomal dominant inheritance and virtually
100% penetrance by the age of 5 years. NF1 results from a loss-
of-function mutation in the NF1 gene resulting in decreased
levels of neurofibromin in the cell. Neurofibromin is a negative
regulator of various intracellular signaling pathways involved
in the proliferation of cell. Although a loss-of-function muta-
tion in the NF1 gene, especially LOH, may predispose NF1 pa-
tients to certain malignancies, additional genetic alterations are
a prerequisite for malignant transformation. The precise nature
of these additional genetic alterations is not well defined,
which mandates genetic testing of all malignancies detected in
NF1 patients. In addition to the germ line NF1 mutations, al-
teration of the somatic NF1 gene has also been associated with
sporadic malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of the colon,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma. Ma-
lignancies in NF1 patients typically occur at an earlier age and,
with an exception of OPGs, carry a poor prognosis compared
with the general population (Table 5). Cancer is the leading
cause of death among NF1 patients, resulting in a 10- to 15-
year decreased life expectancy compared with the general pop-
ulation. The lack of well-defined screening tests for early
detection and the nonspecific clinical presentation contribute
to the poor outcome in NF1-associated malignancies. Small
study group size, mixed patient population, and a lack of uni-
formity in reporting research results make comparison of treat-
ment outcome for this group difficult. An International
Consensus Meeting to address and recommend best practices
for the screening, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of
malignancies associated with NF1 is needed.
