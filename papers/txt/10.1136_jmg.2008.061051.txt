ABSTRACT
Background: Plexiform neurofibromas are benign
tumours that occur in more than half of people with
neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). These tumours can cause
serious complications and can also progress to malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), one of the
leading causes of death among NF1 patients. Plexiform
neurofibromas are clinically heterogeneous, and knowl-
edge of their natural history is limited. In order to
characterise the growth of plexiform neurofibromas
better, we performed serial magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in NF1 patients with such tumours.
Methods: MRI was done on 44 plexiform neurofibromas
in 34 NF1 patients (median age 10 years; range 1–
47 years). Each tumour was measured in two dimensions
from the MRI scan, and the area and growth rate were
calculated. The median length of follow-up was 6 years,
with an average interval of 3 years between scans.
Results: 36 tumours remained stable in size throughout
the period of follow-up. 8 tumours increased in size; all
occurred in patients who were under 21 years of age
when first studied. The single exception was a man who
developed rapid tumour growth and pain in a plexiform
neurofibroma that had been followed for 10 years. Biopsy
showed the presence of an MPNST.
Conclusion: Longitudinal MRI is a valuable means of
monitoring the growth of plexiform neurofibromas in
individuals with NF1.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal domi-
nant disease affecting 1 in 3500 individuals.1 Benign
neurofibromas are the defining feature of NF1.
Plexiform neurofibromas, which may occur almost
anywhere in the body, develop in about half of
individuals with NF1.2–4 Plexiform neurofibromas
are benign, but can be seriously disfiguring, may
erode adjacent bone or blood vessels, may cause
obstruction of the respiratory or gastrointestinal
tract5 or they can progress to malignancy, produ-
cing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours
(MPNSTs), one of the leading causes of premature
death in people with NF1.6

Although plexiform neurofibromas are rarely
diagnosed at birth, many are thought to be
congenital,7 while others appear to develop later
in life.8 Very little objective data exist on the
growth of plexiform neurofibromas,
in part
because their irregular shape and frequent location
deep within the body have made accurate long-
itudinal measurement of tumour size over time
difficult. However, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has been shown to be an effective means of
visualising plexiform neurofibromas9 10 and can be
used to follow them longitudinally.11 In order to
learn more about the natural history of plexiform

neurofibromas, we performed longitudinal MRI
scans of 44 tumours in 34 patients with NF1.

METHODS
Inclusion criteria
Between 1990 to 2006, 41 NF1 patients with
clinically apparent plexiform neurofibromas were
examined with serial MRI as part of their routine
clinical
the National
Institutes of Health Diagnostic Criteria for NF1.12
MRIs were performed every 1 to 4 years, depend-
ing on clinical indication, except during the last
3 years of the study, when annual MRI examina-
tions were done on 27 of the patients. The
investigation was approved by the ethical commit-
tee of the medical chamber in Hamburg.

For the purpose of this study, a tumour was
diagnosed as a plexiform neurofibroma on the basis
of characteristic external appearance or typical
MRI features, such as strong signal intensity on T2
weighted STIR (short-tau inversion recovery),
medium signal intensity on T1 weighted native
images and variable enhancement with contrast.
Histopathological confirmation was not available
for
for a plexiform
neurofibroma to be included in this study, all of
the following imaging criteria were required:
c either axial/coronal or sagittal/axial scans
c reproducible measurability in two dimensions
c a measurement of .10 mm in at least one

these tumours.

In order

dimension

c comparable slice thickness (4 mm), slice gap
(0–25%), and slice orientation on at least three
MRI examinations.

All plexiform neurofibromas included in our
analysis were followed for at least 3 years in adults
or at least 2 years in children. Seven of the 41
patients originally enrolled in the study were
excluded from the analysis because their tumours
could not be followed for this length of time. The
reasons for exclusion were surgical removal of the
tumour in three cases, development of an MPNST
in one case, and loss to follow-up in three cases.

MRI measurement method
MRI was performed using a 1.5 Telsa Siemens
Magnetom 63 SP/Symphony/Avanto scanner.
Sagittal and coronal 4 mm slices were examined.
T1 weighted images had an echo time of 15–25 ms
and a repetition time of (600 ms, and T2
weighted images had an echo time of 80–120 ms
and a repetition time of .2000 ms. T1 weighted
coronal and sagittal images were obtained before
and after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/
kg or 0.2 ml/kg of gadopentetate dimeglumine.

Figure 1 An example of tumour
measurement for a thoracic plexiform
neurofibroma in a patient with NF1. The
size was measured in two orthogonal
directions (called ‘‘horizontal’’ and
‘‘vertical’’). This tumour increased in
vertical length from 10.5 cm in 1990 (A)
to 12.6 cm in 2006 (B). The area of the
tumour is determined from the product of
the largest horizontal and vertical
measurements.

Data collection
All patients underwent a comprehensive physical and neurolo-
gical examination at the time of each visit. MRI examinations
were performed over a period of 16 years, during which the
quality of available imaging improved substantially (see, for
example, fig 1). Volumetric tumour measurements were not
available at the beginning of this study, so two dimensional box
models were used to estimate tumour size throughout the
study. We initially performed MRI scout views in two or three
directions to identify fixed anatomical reference points to define
the region of interest. The target area was measured in the slice
with the largest tumour area (fig 1). Tumour size was
determined as the product of the largest diameter in each
direction (horizontal and vertical). If multiple conglomerating
nodular tumours were present, only the most clearly demar-
cated one was selected for measurement.

Radiologists had access to all previous scans and measure-
ments for comparison at each reading. Tumours were classified
by location (superficial or deep) and type (displacing, invasive or
simple superficial) as previously described.9 10 Plexiform neurofi-
bromas were considered to be superficial if they were located
cutaneously or subcutaneously, respected the epifascial mem-
brane, and did not penetrate into muscle. Tumours that were
located below or penetrated through the subcutaneous tissue
into deeper tissue layers were classified as deep. Plexiform
neurofibromas were considered to be displacing if they were
multinodular, had smoothly defined borders, and compressed
adjacent structures. Neurofibromas were classified as invasive if
they consisted of conglomerating tumours that could not be
divided from each other and that penetrated into adjacent
tissue.

Data analysis
For each tumour, size was plotted as a function of the patient’s
age, and tumour growth rate was determined from the slope of
the linear regression for each individual plexiform neurofibroma.
The distributions of tumour size and growth rate were highly
skewed, so the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used for
multi-class comparisons, and the Mann–Whitney U test for

binary comparisons. Non-parametric correlations were used to
compare initial age at exam and tumour features. All calcula-
tions were performed with SPSS version 11.0 software (SPSS,
Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). A value of p(0.05 was considered
to be significant.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Thirty-four patients (19 males and 15 females with NF1 and at
least one plexiform neurofibroma that could be measured on
MRI) were included in this study. There was no significant
difference in the age at first examination between males (mean
(SD) 17.3 (12.2) years, range 1–45 years) and females (13.5
(13.0) years, range 1–47 years).

All patients received at least three MRI scans, and 13 patients
(29%) received four MRI scans. Altogether, 145 MRI scans were
evaluated on the 44 tumours studied. The median length of
follow-up was 6.0 years (range 1–15 years), and the average
interval between scans was 3.0 (1.9) years (range 1–9 years).
Supplemental table 1 summarises the findings on each of the
patients and tumours.

The median tumour size was somewhat greater in females than
in males, both on first examination (8.7 cm2, range 0.3–
97.8 cm2, vs 7.1 cm2, range 0–200.0 cm2) and on the final MRI
examination included in the study (15.8 cm2,

difference between the initial and final tumour size was
significantly greater in females (5.1 cm2, range 0–53.2 cm2) than
in males (0.5 cm2 range 0–75.0 cm2) (p = 0.037). The tumour
growth rate was also greater in females (0.8 cm2/year, range 0–
12.9 cm2/year) than in males (0.1 cm2/year, range 0–5.4 cm2/
year), but
this difference did not quite reach statistical
significance (p = 0.055). One patient (patient 14) had a second
plexiform neurofibroma identified for the first time on a follow-
up examination of another tumour imaged as part of this study.
Tumours classified by location as superficial grew more
rapidly than those classified as deep (p = 0.034) (table 2). There
was no significant difference in initial tumour size, final tumour
size, change in tumour size, or growth rate between tumours
classified by anatomical site or by type as invasive, displacing, or
simple superficial (table 2). Figure 2 shows the tumour size and
growth by age for all tumours, classified by both location and
type.

.20 cm2 on initial examination occurred in children. The
median age of the NF1 patients included in this study was
10 years. The median initial and final tumour sizes were not
significantly different between individuals ,10 years of age at
initial examination (initial tumour size 4.8 cm2 and final
tumour size 8.5 cm2) and individuals who were .10 years of
age at initial examination (initial tumour size 9.4 cm2 and final

tumour size 13.2 cm2). However, the difference between the
initial and final tumour size was significantly greater in younger
individuals (3.2 cm2) compared to older individuals (0.2 cm2,
p = 0.031). In addition, the growth rate of tumours in younger
individuals (0.7 cm2/year) was significantly greater than that of
tumours in individuals .10 years of age at initial examination

There was a significant negative correlation between patient
age at initial examination and the difference between the initial
and final tumour size (p = 0.003), and also between patient age
at initial examination and tumour growth rate (p = 0.001).

To determine if tumour growth among younger NF1 patients
could be accounted for by normal growth of the individual, we
calculated the tumour size/unit body mass index (BMI) and
plotted the values by age (data not shown). All tumours that
displayed substantial growth in NF1 patients ,13 years of age
(fig 2) also increased in size relative to BMI, suggesting that the
tumour growth in these individuals was greater than would be
expected on the basis of normal body growth.

Seven individuals had more than one plexiform neurofibroma
imaged for this study. The growth pattern of multiple tumours
within the same individual varied, even when the tumours were
of the same type and/or in a similar region of the body (table 3).

DISCUSSION
Very little information beyond clinical anecdote is available on
the natural history of benign tumour growth in NF1. This is the
first longitudinal MRI study of plexiform neurofibroma growth
in a large series of unselected and untreated (no surgical or drug
intervention) NF1 patients to be reported and the age range of
the patients reflects that of a general NF1 clinic population.

Most of the plexiform neurofibromas found in our patients
were small (,10 cm2) but the largest tumours seen were all in
children. The occurrence of large tumours in children but not in
adults with NF1 is unexpected if plexiform neurofibromas are

all congenital neoplasms that grow irregularly after birth, as is
often stated.13 14 One possible explanation for our finding is
selection bias, whereby young patients with large tumours were
more likely than older patients with lesions of similar size to
have participated in this multi-year follow-up study. Another
possibility is that large neurofibromas in children have a very
high risk for malignant degeneration or producing other lethal
outcomes and may not live beyond early adulthood. This
possibility demands further investigation because of its clinical
importance.

The identification of a new plexiform neurofibroma in one
individual was incidental, as it was identified on follow-up MRI
within a region imaged for another tumour that was part of the
study. Because the MRI examinations performed in this study
were targeted to the location of suspected or known tumours, it
is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the rate of
new plexiform neurofibroma formation.

Superficial plexiform neurofibromas grew more rapidly than the
deep plexiform tumours included in our study (p = 0.034) (table 2).
This novel observation requires independent confirmation but
suggests that tumour location may affect tumour growth.

We found no relationship of neurofibroma growth to
anatomic site (table 2) or radiological classification as displacing,
invasive or simple superficial.9 10 However, the number of
tumours in each of these categories was small, and their size
and growth rates were quite variable.

Neurofibromas from younger individuals grew faster than
neurofibromas from older individuals. The growth rate of
tumours in younger individuals exceeded the increase in their
BMI, so the rapid tumour growth we observed in some young
NF1 patients cannot be attributed to the expected growth in the
child’s body with age. This observation is consistent with the
findings of a recent study that used volumetric MRI to measure
the growth of plexiform neurofibromas in 49 NF1 patients over
a median period of 34 months.11

We observed growth of 2 cm2/year or more in 30% of
tumours in individuals under 13 years of age. Our patients were
recruited from a specialised neurofibromatosis clinic and may
have had tumours that tended to be more aggressive than most
NF1 associated plexiform neurofibromas. Dombi et al recently
observed measurable growth in 57% of 61 plexiform neurofi-
bromas in 49 young NF1 patients,11 but most patients included
in that study were selected because they had inoperable or
progressive tumours. In addition, the volumetric method used
to document tumour growth in Dombi’s study is more sensitive
than the two dimensional measurements we used.

All tumours, with one exception, that showed substantial
growth were from NF1 patients under the age of 13 years at
initial examination. The single exception is remarkable: a
previously stable superficial
invasive plexiform neurofibroma
in a man who developed tumour associated pain and substantial
growth on MRI, and the tumour was found to be an MPNST on
biopsy. The patient was treated by amputation and is alive
8 years after diagnosis.

MPNSTs generally have a poor prognosis, particularly in
people with NF1, with 5 year survival estimated to be only 21–
41%.15 16 Recognition of malignant degeneration within an
existing plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF1 presents
a formidable diagnostic challenge. Differences in the appearance
of the lesions on MRI are sometimes apparent,17 18 and changes
that occur over time may be especially informative. Positron
emission tomography (PET) appears to be an effective tool for

distinguishing MPNSTs from most, but not all, benign plexi-
form neurofibromas in NF1.19 The findings in this case raise the
possibility that longitudinal monitoring of plexiform neurofi-
broma growth by MRI may permit recognition of malignant
degeneration within a benign tumour. Early detection of
MPNSTs in patients with NF1 may provide the opportunity
for more successful treatment.

In NF1 patients who had more than one plexiform
neurofibroma, the growth of different tumours often differed
(table 3). This observation suggests that each tumour needs to
be followed separately and that one tumour cannot be used to
represent the growth rate of all tumours in an individual.

Current guidelines for management of patients with NF1
recommend imaging studies only when indicated on the basis of
clinical signs or symptoms.3 20–22 However, clinical indications
for obtaining an MRI to evaluate plexiform neurofibromas have
not been established, and the optimal frequency or even the
value of follow-up examinations has not been determined. In
our study, 23 plexiform neurofibromas were identified on initial
MRI examination in 18 NF1 patients under the age of 10 years.
Only seven (33%) of these 23 tumours were symptomatic,
including only four (57%) of the nine rapidly progressing
tumours. Our findings suggest that routine MRI screening of
young NF1 patients for plexiform neurofibromas may be
valuable. A large scale longitudinal MRI study of an unselected
cohort of NF1 patients of various ages needs to be done to
define more fully the natural history of plexiform neurofibro-
mas, to determine the risk for developing MPNSTs in patients
with rapidly growing tumours, and to find the optimal strategy
for use of MRI in the management of NF1 patients.
