Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent genetic disorder primarily characterized by the formation of
neuroﬁbromas, cafe´ -au-lait spots and freckling. Skeletal abnormalities such as short stature or bowing/pseu-
darthrosis of the tibia are relatively common. To investigate the role of the neuroﬁbromin in skeletal devel-
opment, we crossed Nf1ﬂox mice with Prx1Cre mice to inactivate Nf1 in undifferentiated mesenchymal
cells of the developing limbs. Similar to NF1 affected individuals, Nf1Prx1 mice show bowing of the tibia
and diminished growth. Tibial bowing is caused by decreased stability of the cortical bone due to a high
degree of porosity, decreased stiffness and reduction in the mineral content as well as hyperosteoidosis.
Accordingly, osteoblasts show an increase in proliferation and a decreased ability to differentiate and miner-
alize in vitro. The reduction in growth is due to lower proliferation rates and a differentiation defect of chon-
drocytes. Abnormal vascularization of skeletal tissues is likely to contribute to this pathology as it exerts a
negative effect on cortical bone stability. Furthermore, Nf1 has an important role in the development of joints,
as shown by fusion of the hip joints and other joint abnormalities, which are not observed in neuroﬁbroma-
tosis type I. Thus, neuroﬁbromin has multiple essential roles in skeletal development and growth.

INTRODUCTION

Human conditions that predispose to cancer usually carry het-
erozygous germline (inherited) mutations in growth regulator
genes that are essential for organized cell growth and differen-
tiation. Affected individuals are at signiﬁcant risk to develop
benign or malignant tumors early in life because only one
additional genetic alteration (loss of the wt allele) is needed
to facilitate tumorigenesis. Cells that have lost both copies
of the tumor suppressor gene have a growth advantage over
wt cells. In a susceptible environment, this ‘second hit’ may
result in tumor formation. Intriguingly, many cancer predispo-
sition syndromes are associated with non-tumor abnormalities
that usually occur in an irregular and mosaic manner, indicat-
ing that similar mechanisms may account for these changes.
Here, the second hit occurs during early stages of development

revealing important functions of the mutated gene during
embryogenesis or fetal growth.

One example for such a condition is neuroﬁbromatosis type
1 (NF1; OMIM #162200), a tumor predisposition syndrome
mainly characterized by the occurrence of pigmented skin
lesions (cafe´-au-lait spots) and the formation of tumors (neuro-
ﬁbromas) along peripheral and optic nerves that are derived
from nerve sheath (Schwann) cells (1). Although these
changes are a relatively constant ﬁnding, a wide variety of
non-tumor manifestations have been described that occur in
association with NF1 at a lower frequency. These include
hypertension, macrocephaly and a variety of
skeletal
changes such as scoliosis, vertebral dysplasia, short stature,
sphenoid wing dysplasia and pseudarthrosis or bowing of the
tibia (2,3). Other less common abnormalities of the skeleton
include local overgrowth, abnormalities of the rib cage, genu

varum/valgum, lytic bone lesions, osteosclerosis, rib fusion,
absence of the patella, syndactyly and other congenital bone
malformations (4). These clinical ﬁndings suggest a role for
NF1 in skeletal development and have raised the question
whether skeletal dysplasia is a primary feature of NF1 (2).
Investigations of affected skeletal tissue in tibial pseudarthro-
sis have shown additional mutations of the second NF1 allele
indicating that the homozygous loss of NF1 function can be
detrimental for normal bone development (5). Thus, like in
NF1-mediated tumorigenicity, a loss of both NF1 alleles is
likely to be required to cause the phenotype.

The molecular pathogenesis of NF1 has been elucidated by
the identiﬁcation of causative mutations in the gene which
encodes neuroﬁbromin. Neuroﬁbromin is a large cytoplasmic
protein with a small central region that shows homologies to
the GTPase activating family of proteins (GAP), and therefore
is termed the GAP-related domain (GRD) (6). Members of the
Ras-GAP family share a similar function by negatively regu-
lating a key signal
transduction protein called p21-Ras.
is a small G-protein involved in transmitting
P21-Ras
signals from various growth factor
receptors to a large
number of downstream signaling molecules that eventually
alter gene expression in the nucleus (7). Thus, loss of neuroﬁ-
bromin activity is expected to lead to the inability to shut off
activated p21-Ras with subsequent aberrant growth promoting
signals. This is similar to mutant forms of RAS found in
human tumors that have greatly decreased GTPase activity,
resulting in accumulation of RAS in the GTP-bound active
form.

Dysregulation of Ras proteins by activating mutations,
overexpression or upstream activation is a common and exten-
sively studied phenomenon in human tumors. In contrast,
much less is known about the physiological role of Ras in
development and tissue maintenance. One route of Ras acti-
vation is through ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling.
FGFs are secreted molecules, which function through the acti-
vation of speciﬁc tyrosine kinase receptors, the FGF receptors
(FGFR), which transduce the signal by activating a variety of
pathways including the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. In the
growth plate, FGFR3 serves as a negative regulator of chon-
drocyte proliferation and differentiation and activating
mutations result
in skeletal disease and short stature (8).
Interestingly, mutations in PTPN11, a gene encoding the
nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 involved in
the transduction of FGFR signaling to Ras, result in Noonan
(OMIM #163950) syndrome, a condition also characterized
by short stature (9). A phenocopy of this condition can be
caused by mutations in NF1 (neuroﬁbromatosis – Noonan syn-
drome, OMIM #601321) and by de novo germline mutations
of the KRAS gene (10).

The role of Nf1 in tumor formation and development has
been studied in mice with inactivated Nf1 alleles (11 – 13).
Affected mice exhibit neural closure defects (exencephaly)
and cardiovascular abnormalities including structural malfor-
mations of the outﬂow tract of the heart and enlarged endo-
cardial cushions. These Nf1-deﬁcient embryos die between
embryonic days 12.5 and 13.5, presumably due to the
cardiac vessel defect. In contrast, inactivation of NF1 in the
neural crest does not cause cardiac defects but results in
tumors of neural crest origin resembling those seen in

humans with NF1 (11). To investigate the function of NF1
in skeletal development, we inactivated Nf1 during early
mouse limb development using the transgenic mouse line
Prx1Cre. In these mice Cre is expressed in undifferentiated
mesenchymal cells in the limb bud resulting in efﬁcient inac-
tivation of the Nf1 gene in the appendicular skeleton (14).
This approach is likely to reﬂect the situation in NF1 patients
with irregular, non-generalized lesions. Such lesions can be
expected to be due to mutational events that inactivate the
remaining wt NF1 allele during early stages of development
resulting in NF1 inactivation in entire cell
lineages. Our
results indicate that Nf1 has multiple roles in skeletal develop-
ment including joint formation, growth plate function, osteo-
blast differentiation, and control of vessel growth. Thus,
short stature and bowing of the tibia, skeletal defects fre-
quently associated with NF1, are caused by a primary function
of neuroﬁbromin in skeletal development and homeostasis.

RESULTS

Because Nf1 inactivation results in early lethality due to a
severe heart malformation, we used a conditional inactivation
approach to ablate Nf1 function speciﬁcally in the limb skel-
eton. Mice with a conditional allele of Nf1 (Nf1ﬂox) suscep-
tible to Cre-mediated recombination in vivo were crossed
with Prx1Cre transgenic mice (Prx1cre). Cre recombinase in
Prx1cre mice is expressed in early and late stages of limb
bud development,
in the lateral plate mesoderm and the
cranial part of the developing head mesenchyme (14) (Sup-
plementary Material, Fig. S1A). We used an allele-speciﬁc
PCR to determine the Cre recombinase-mediated excision
rate in osteoblasts, chondrocytes, bone marrow derived endo-
thelial cells and osteoclasts (Fig. 1A). As expected, only osteo-
clasts, which are of hematopoietic descent, showed no
recombination, whereas all other cell types underwent efﬁcient
Cre-mediated excision of the Nf1ﬂox allele.

Nf1 is essential for the development of joints
;Prx1cre  Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox crossings gave the expected
Nf1ﬂox/þ
Mendelian ratios of Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;Prx1cre mice, which we abbre-
viate as Nf1Prx1 in the following. Newborn Nf1Prx1 mice were
easily recognized at birth due to their inability to bend their
hind limbs at the hip joint (Fig. 1B). Examination of the
stained skeletons and histological analysis revealed cartilagi-
nous fusions of the hip joints (Fig. 1C). We observed abnormal
hips in all animals but the phenotype varied between complete
and partial fusion. Analysis of the hip joint at the age of 4
weeks using mCT demonstrated a distorted morphology of
the femoral neck and the femoral head (Fig. 1D). We investi-
gated other joints for anomalies to see if this phenomenon was
restricted to the hip. The shoulder joint appeared normal, but
the elbow joint was severely deformed (data not shown).
Although knee joints of Nf1Prx1 animals were not fused,
serial sections of stage P14 revealed several abnormalities
(Fig. 1E). Most important was a drastic reduction of the size
of the menisci, which also points to a defect in joint cavitation.
To determine the normal time point of joint development in
the hip, we investigated wt animals at stages E12.5 – E15.5 by

regulated. In the corresponding region, Nf1Prx1 mice show persistence of Sox9 nuclear localization and Col2a1 expression (arrow). Gdf5 is expressed in the
future joint region but is downregulated in Nf1Prx1 mice at E13.5 and E14.5. t, tibia; f, femur; p, pelvis. Scale bars: 100 mm.

femur/pelvis anlage (Fig. 1F). A small cartilaginous conden-
sation present at E12.5 (data not shown) developed into carti-
laginous anlage of the future pelvis and the adjacent femur at
E13.5. Similar to other future joint regions, femur and pelvis
are fused as one cartilaginous anlage at this stage, as indicated
by a continuous expression pattern of Col2a1. Expression of
Gdf5 was observed at the site of the future joint at E13.5,
but expression levels were clearly lower in mutant mice indi-
cating that
the process of joint cavity formation was not
initiated. In controls a joint interzone became apparent and
the femur and pelvis anlage began to separate at E14.5,
whereas this process was severely disturbed in Nf1Prx1 mice.
Sox9 is an essential regulator of chondrocyte cell fate decision
(15). In control joints, we observed a normal nuclear distri-
bution of Sox9 throughout the cartilage anlage at E13.5. Con-
comitant with the formation of an interzone at E14.5, cells of
this region showed a shift of Sox9 localization from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm. In contrast, the nuclear localization
persisted in all cells of the cartilage anlage in Nf1f Prx1 mice
(Fig. 1F upper panel). Thus, the hip joint phenotype obser-
ved in the Nf1f Prx1 mutant animals is due to a lack of
joint cavity initiation caused by an impaired chondrocyte
de-differentiation in the presumptive joint region.

Loss of Nf1 recapitulates human Nf1-associated
tibial bowing

Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a rare but severe com-
plication of NF1. It is characterized by recurrent fractures of
the lower leg in early childhood. Callus formation fails and
bone healing tends to be insufﬁcient. The ﬁrst sign of this
skeletal complication is anterolateral bowing of the tibia.
Using optical projection tomography (OPT) to construct a
three-dimensional image of the hind limbs, we observed an
the tibia in all Nf1Prx1 mutants
anterolateral bowing of
(Fig. 2A, Supplementary Material, Movies) and compared it
with the bowing in human NF1 cases (for comparison, see
Fig. 2B). The bowing started before birth, as it was already
apparent in newborns. It progressed thereafter but did not
worsen after 2 weeks of age. The ﬁbula was relatively
mildly affected with slight bowing in the distal part detectable
at P7. The phenotype is fully penetrant, as among 185 pups
born in 25 litters, we observed 62 mutant animals, all of
which exhibited conspicuous tibia bowing. Because bowing
may occur due to a reduced stiffness, we investigated the
physical properties of cortical bone in Nf1Prx1 mutants. We
performed back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging of cortical
bone from 2-week-old mice (for description see Materials
and Methods). In normal bone, the porosity is at the order of
10% (+7% SD) mostly due to irregularly distributed osteo-
cyte lacunae (16). In Nf1Prx mutants we observed an increased
porosity (24% +9% SD), which was not correlated to osteo-
cyte lacunae (Fig. 2D). Pore sizes were up to 50 mm, whereas
osteocyte lacunae are just a few microns (Fig. 2C, left panel).
Using the same technique, we found a signiﬁcant (P , 0.001)
decrease in tissue calcium content in mutants (Fig. 2D). To
determine the micrometer level elastic and plastic response
of the cortical bone, we used the nanoindentation device, by
making small indents (,1 mm) on polished plastic-embedded

877

cortical bone. The nanoindentation modulus in bone samples
was found to be decreased signiﬁcantly from 13 – 16 GPa in
controls to 9 – 11 GPa in mutant samples (Fig. 2E). Note that
nanoindentation measures the material (matrix-mineral com-
posite) response very locally (at a scale much smaller than
the pores and within bone matrix only) and is not inﬂuenced
by the porosity.

To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the
observed cortical porosity, we performed serial sections of the
diaphysis of the tibia. The cortical bone of mutants showed
abnormally large non-mineralized areas populated by blood
vessels and ﬁbroblast-like cells. CD34 staining conﬁrmed that,
in contrast to controls, the non-mineralized areas in Nf1Prx1
bones were rich in blood vessels penetrating the cortex from
the periosteum to the bone marrow cavity (Fig. 2F). We did
not observe an increase in osteoclast number within the poros-
ities (data not shown). Histological analysis of the appendicular
bone showed an increased thickness of the osteoid (Fig. 2G) and
an increased number of osteoblasts, indicating abnormalities in
osteoblast differentiation and/or proliferation in Nf1Prx1 mice.

Altered osteoblast differentiation and proliferation
by loss of Nf1

To identify the reason for the reduction of bone strength and
mineralization, we investigated osteoblast differentiation
in vitro. For this purpose, we used calvarial osteoblasts
obtained from wt and mutant P5 animals, as cultivation of cal-
varial osteoblasts is a well-established method to study in vitro
bone formation, and Prx1 is known to be expressed in the
developing skull vault
(14). Nf1 excision rate analysis
showed that the Prx1-driven Cre-recombinase had efﬁciently
excised the ﬂoxed allele in these cells (Fig. 1B). Alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity was signiﬁcantly reduced in
Nf1Prx1 osteoblasts after osteogenic stimulation (Fig. 2H).
In addition, mineralization, a hallmark of osteoblast differen-
tiation, was diminished (Fig. 2I). These ﬁndings were mirrored
by reduced alkaline phosphatase (Akp2) mRNA levels and by
a decrease of the terminally differentiated osteoblast markers
integrin-binding sialoprotein (Ibsp) and osteocalcin (Ocn),
which are normally expressed at this stage. In contrast, the
early differentiation marker osteopontin (Opn) appeared to
be strongly induced (Fig. 2J). Thus, a loss of Nf1 in mesench-
ymal progenitor cells or immature osteoblasts leads to an
accumulation of
incompletely differentiated osteoblasts
in vitro and in vivo. To test a possible effect on proliferation,
the osteoblast cell division rate was quantiﬁed by BrdU
labeling (Fig. 2K). The labeling index of mutant cells was
increased when compared with controls. Thus, loss of Nf1
results in increased osteoblast proliferation, similar to the
effect observed in other cell types after Nf1 inactivation.

Inactivation of Nf1 results in growth retardation and
abnormal growth plates
Nf1Prx1 mice exhibit congenital limb shortening (Fig. 3A and
B). Measurements of bone growth over time demonstrated a
25% reduction in size of all long bones by P7 in the mutant
animals (Supplementary Material, Table S1). This growth
defect correlated with an abnormal growth plate with

narrowed hypertrophic and proliferative zones (Fig. 3C). His-
tomorphometric measurement of tibial growth plates showed
signiﬁcant reduction of the hypertrophic and proliferative
zones (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the development of secondary

ossiﬁcation centers was clearly delayed (Fig. 1E). To deter-
mine whether reduced proliferation contributes to the shorten-
ing of long bones, we measured chondrocyte proliferation
rates in control and mutant growth plates after BrdU labeling.

880

Human Molecular Genetics, 2007, Vol. 16, No. 8

We found a reduction of the proliferation rate in mutant
animals (Fig. 3E).

Marker gene expression in the different zones of the growth
plate was evaluated by in situ hybridization at E15.5 and in
newborn animals (P1) (Fig. 3F and G). We found no major
difference in the expression of collagen type II (Col2a1),
the major collagen of cartilage. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is a
major regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differen-
tiation. At both stages,
Ihh expression was signiﬁcantly
reduced, a ﬁnding which was further corroborated by a
decreased expression of patched (ptc),
the Ihh receptor,
which is a downstream target of Ihh. At P1, we found a
reduced expression zone of Col10a1 corresponding to a
reduced size of the hypertrophic zone. Osteopontin (Opn),
which is expressed in the most terminal hypertrophic chondro-
cytes and in osteoblasts, was clearly upregulated at all stages
investigated. This was paralleled by an increased expression
of Mmp13, a metalloproteinase that acts synergistically with
osteoclast-expressed Mmp9 to degrade the hypertrophic carti-
lage matrix. Histomorphometric quantiﬁcation of the number
of osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous junction revealed an
increase in the number as well as the surface area of
tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP)-stained cells
indicating increased osteoclast activity (Fig. 3H,I).

To conﬁrm the in situ hybridization results, we performed
quantitative PCR of knee growth plates (Fig. 4A). We found
a strong upregulation of Opn. Expression of Lef1 and Pea1,
two transcription factors known to activate Opn, was also
increased. Furthermore, we detected an upregulation of Sox9
and Mmp9. No signiﬁcant regulation was found for different
isoforms of VEGF, as well as for Runx2 and RANKL. Ihh,
PTHrP and Col10a1 were downregulated. Western blots con-
ﬁrmed the upregulation of Sox9 and Opn (Fig. 4B). To further
investigate the intrisic role of Nf1 in cartilage, we isolated
chondrocytes from wt and Nf1Prx1 growth plates to propagate
them in vitro. After serum starvation, we were able to demon-
strate increased level of GTP-Ras and pErk1/2 in mutant cells,
whereas expression of Erk1 and Erk2 was not changed
(Fig. 4C and D). p21/Waf1, an important regulator of cell
proliferation was upregulated in Nf1Prx1 cells.

Loss of Nf1 induces invasive blood vessel growth

In endochondral ossiﬁcation, the formation of vessels is tightly
coupled with osteoclast activity and both processes seem to be
dependent on signals released from the growth plate through
the activity of MMPs. The number and size of CD34-positive
blood vessels invading the growth plate was signiﬁcantly
increased in Nf1Prx1 mutant animals (Fig. 5A). Cartilage is
one of the few tissues without signiﬁcant vasculature. Never-
theless, proper vascularization adjacent to the growth plate is
essential for bone growth. The groove of Ranvier is a circum-
ferential
the periphery of the growth plate
containing a vascular plexus and osteoblast and chondrocyte
progenitor cells (17). Compared with wt, the vessels in this
structure were larger in Nf1Prx1 mice and appeared unorga-
nized (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the vessels originating from
the groove of Ranvier penetrated the growth plate between
the
layer
(Fig. 5C). Hence, not only the cortical bone but also the

indentation at

proliferating

and

hypertrophic

chondrocyte

growth plate cartilage shows signs of abnormal vascularization
which is
likely to contribute to the complex skeletal
phenotype.

DISCUSSION

This study shows that Nf1 is a major regulator of development
and growth of the skeleton. The inactivation of Nf1 in mouse
limbs recapitulates the human NF1-associated skeletal pheno-
types in several aspects. Similar to NF1 affected individuals,
Nf1Prx1 mice show diminished growth, and, as a more speciﬁc
sign, bowing of the tibia. These multiple effects on the skel-
eton are due to abnormal differentiation and proliferation of
osteoblasts and growth plate chondrocytes, as well as an
abnormal formation of vessels within the skeleton. Further-
more, we observed a defect in the development of joints, a
phenotype which has so far not been described in NF1
patients. Our results support
the hypothesis that osseous
dysplasia is a primary feature of NF1 (2).

Nf1 is involved in the early steps of joint formation

During development, the vertebrate appendicular skeleton car-
tilaginous anlagen of the future bones are initially laid down as
continuous elements without joints. In a later, highly coordi-
nated process, joints are placed within the anlagen, thus creat-
ing the individual skeletal elements. This process involves, in
principle, four steps: patterning, formation of an interzone
with concomitant loss of the chondrocyte phenotype at the
future joint, cavitation, a process which eventually gives rise
to the joint space, and the development of a joint capsule (18).
As shown by the early fusions in the hip, Nf1 is important
for joint patterning and the initial phase of joint formation,
i.e. the formation of an interzone and the subsequent down-
regulation of genes characteristic for chondrocytes such as
Col2a1 and Sox9. Several genes and pathways have been
implicated in this process. Gdf5 is a signaling molecule of
the BMP family which plays a pivotal role in joint formation,
as shown by human and mouse Gdf5 mutants. Alterations of
Gdf5 activity, either by activating mutations or by loss-of-
function mutations of its inhibitor noggin result
in joint
fusions in humans (19). In the mouse, loss of Gdf5 results in
smaller cartilaginous anlagen of the digits and a lack of joint
formation (20). We observed a strong downregulation of
Gdf5 expression in mutant hip joints, a ﬁnding which corre-
lates well with the diminished interzone formation. Associated
with the downregulation of Gdf5, we observed a persistence of
nuclear Sox9 expression, a transcription factor essential for
chondrocyte differentiation and one of the main regulators
of collagen type II (Col2a1), the predominant collagen of
cartilage (21). During interzone formation, Sox9 is no longer
detectable in the nucleus of wt interzone cells, a shift in
expression, which is likely to be important for interzone for-
mation. With persistent nuclear expression of Sox9, cells in
the presumptive interzone can be expected to remain chondro-
cytic, thus contributing to the joint fusion. Other pathways are
likely to be involved in addition. Overexpression of an acti-
vated form of

mutant cells is less prominent. Mutant cells also exhibit increased levels of p21/waf1 and Sox9 expression. Positions of molecular weight markers were assigned
at the left site of the panel. (D) Increased GTP-Ras/Ras and pErk/Erk1 ratios illustrating Ras pathway activation in Nf1Prx1 cells as determined by densitometric

phenotype in interzone cells.

Inactivation of Nf1 results in bowing of long bones

Long bone osteopathy occurs in ~5% of NF1 patients usually
presenting as unilateral anterolateral bowing of the tibia. Patho-
logical fractures of the affected bone are frequent, and as a com-
plication (i.e. non-union), a pseudarthrosis or ‘false joint’ can
develop (2,23). The pathogenesis of this severe complication
remains largely obscure, but analysis of the adjacent tissue
has shown that inactivation of both NF1 alleles is frequent in
tibial pseudarthrosis (5). Primary histological ﬁndings of
resected tissue include the presence of highly cellular, little vas-
cularized, ﬁbromatous-like tissue, commonly associated with a
thickened periosteum (24) and, in some cases, abnormal vascu-
lature with thickened vessel walls. (25). Congenital pseudar-
throsis of the tibia occurs also in the absence of the classic
NF1 phenotype (23). Owing to the high similarity of the clinical
and histological presentation, namely the growth of an abnor-
mal ﬁbrous tissue, this has been interpreted as a localized
skeletal expression of NF1 in individuals with unknown/
cryptic NF1 (24). Inactivation of Nf1 in mice recapitulates
the human phenotype. Like in humans, bowing is already
present at birth. Fractures do not occur in mice but this is
most likely due to insufﬁcient mechanical stress. The inability
of mutant mice to bend their hips has to be taken into consider-
ation because disuse leads to bone loss. Studies using either tail

suspension, sciatectomy or limb immobilization to induce
mechanical unloading showed a decrease in cancellous bone
density and cortical thinning due to reduced osteoblast prolifer-
ation and increased bone resorption (26,27). This is in contrast
to our ﬁnding that in Nf1Prx1 mutants the osteoblast number at
the cortical surface and the osteoblast proliferation in vitro are
increased, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms. The
reason for bowing can be found in the abnormal structure and
stability of the cortical bone. Histology and BSE imaging
demonstrated a dramatically increased porosity ( p) of the cor-
tical bone. Furthermore, we evaluated the local stiffness and
hardness of the bone by nanoindentation, a method to determine
the micrometer level elastic and plastic response of material by
making small indents (with depth typically less than 1 mm) on
ﬂat polished sections (16). Nanoindentation showed a reduction
in the elastic modulus (E) of the bone material itself. The
average Young’s modulus (relevant for the bending stiffness
of the bone), which is typically given by E (1 2 p)n, decreases
not only by a reduction in E, but also by an increased porosity p
(28). In the most favorable case, the reduction due to porosity is

linear (n ¼ 1). In other cases (e.g. in random foams or cancel-
lous bone), the dependence is even quadratic with n¼2 (29).

Thus, the observed bending of long bones may be attributed
to changes in the bone material (E, from nanoindentation)
and an additional reduction inferred from the extra porosity p
in the bone cortex. Staining for CD34 revealed that increased
numbers of vessels contribute to the porosity of the cortical
bone and thus the bending of the tibia. Another factor likely
to contribute to the reduction of the stiffness E of the bone
material is the reduced calcium content as demonstrated by
BSE imaging.

To investigate the reasons for this ﬁnding, we cultured cal-
varial osteoblasts and found a reduced expression of ALP and
a diminished capacity to mineralize extracellular matrix, a hall-
mark of differentiated osteoblasts. The reduced expression of
other marker genes of osteoblast differentiation such as osteo-
calcin (Ocn) and integrin-binding sialoprotein (Ibsp) and their
increased rate of proliferation indicate that these cells persist
in an early stage of differentiation. In addition, we found an
upregulation of osteopontin, a gene predominantly expressed
in immature osteoblasts. Opn is a known inhibitor of calciﬁca-
tion (30,31) and its overexpression is thus likely to contribute to
the phenotype. These in vitro ﬁndings are in good agreement
with the abnormalities observed in our Nf1Prx1 mouse model,
in particular the increased number of osteoblasts on the bone
surface and the thickening of the osteoid. In agreement with
our ﬁndings, it has been shown that haploinsufﬁciency of Nf1
results in a block of osteoblast differentiation, increased pro-
liferation and the induction of osteopontin (32). However,
loss of one Nf1 allele does not result in an overt bone phenotype,
thus indicating the existence of compensatory mechanisms.
Interestingly, treatment of osteoblasts with FGF has similar
effects including an increase in proliferation, a reduction of
ALP activity and Ocn expression, as well as an upregulation
of Opn indicating a common regulatory pathway (33).

Thus,

the observed thickening of the osteoid and the
reduced calcium content is likely to be caused by a defect of
osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Together with an
increase in porosity, this results in bone which is less resistant
to mechanical forces. The asymmetries of muscle forces at the

lower limb (posterior versus anterior muscle mass) induce
asymmetric strain, which leads to the observed bending.
Similar mechanisms are likely to cause congenital
tibial
bowing in humans. Increasing mechanical forces associated
with walking can be expected to potentiate these effects
ﬁnally resulting in fracture and pseudarthrosis, a phenotype
not observed in Nf1Prx1 mice.

Nf1 controls proliferation and differentiation of growth
plate chondrocytes

Children with NF1 characteristically have mild short stature (2).
Longitudinal growth in the prenatal fetal period and after
birth is generated in the growth plates through endochondral
ossiﬁcation, a process involving the production of cartilaginous
matrix which is subsequently removed and replaced by bone
(8). In Nf1Prx1 limbs, we observed a reduced proliferation rate
of the growth plate chondrocytes as well as reduction in the
size of the hypertrophic zone. Ihh has been shown to be a
major regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation
through Pthrp-dependent and independent pathways (34,35).
Low levels of Ihh, as observed in Nf1Prx1 growth plates, result
in reduced proliferation and a smaller zone of hypertrophy.
Reduced proliferation rates, a downregulation of Ihh expression
and short bones are also observed in mice carrying an activating
mutation in Fgfr3 (36). Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway activation downstream of Ras signal-
ing in chondrocytes results in an achondroplasia-like dwarﬁsm
(37), similar to phenotype observed upon Sox9 overexpression
(38). Both effects, the activation of Sox9 and the downregula-
tion of Ihh, were observed in Nf1Prx1 growth plates, explaining,
at least in part, the Nf1Prx1 associated phenotype. Our results
suggest that
the short stature frequently observed in NF1
patients is caused by abnormal proliferation and differentiation
of growth plate chondrocytes.

In situ expression analysis and quantitative PCR showed a
strong upregulation of osteopontin (Opn), a secreted cytokine
and cell attachment protein that is produced by many cell
types. In bone, it is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts
and in terminally differentiated chondrocytes at the chondro-
osseous border (39). Opn contains an RGDS sequence motif
that can promote attachment, survival and migration of
several cell types, including osteoclasts and endothelial cells
(40). Furthermore, Opn was shown to have an angiogenic
effect
in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
assay (41) and is known to facilitate angiogenesis in bone
(42). On the basis of these ﬁndings, the overexpression of
Opn is likely to contribute to the increase in osteoclasts and
vasculature observed at the chondro-osseous junction of Nf1
mutant mice. Opn expression in chondrocytes and osteoblasts
was shown to be induced by Fgfr3 activating mutations in vivo
(43). In a parallel study, constitutive Fgfr3 activation resulted
in increased vascular invasion and osteoclastogenesis at the
chondro-osseous junction (44). Opn has been shown to be
regulated by Ras. The Opn promotor contains Lef1-, Ets-
and AP1-binding motifs, each of which mediates only a
weak effect on transcription. However, coexpression of Pea3
and Lef1 strongly enhanced Opn promoter responsiveness
(45). We found both Pea3 and Lef1 expression upregulated

883

in Nf1Prx1 limbs, suggesting that these transcription factors
mediated the effect of increased Ras signaling on Opn.

Nf1 is involved in the regulation of vessel formation
Nf1Prx1 mice show several abnormalities of vessel formation
in the developing bone and cartilage. Cartilage is normally
devoid of vessels. Supply of nutrients is accomplished by a
dense layer of vessels at the chondro-osseous junction as
well as by a vascular plexus surrounding the growth plate at
the groove of Ranvier. We observed an increased penetration
of vessels into the growth plate at the chondro-osseous junc-
tion and in the groove of Ranvier, as well as an increase in
the number of vessels in the cortical bone. Using the mouse
cornea neovascularization model, Wu et al. (46) were able
to show a greater endothelial cell proliferation and an
þ/2 mice.
increased inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells in Nf1
An enhanced sensitivity to angiogenic factors, as recently
shown for human and murine Nf1-deﬁcient endothelial cells,
is likely to underlie this phenomenon (47). A role for Ras-
signaling during development of vessels is further supported
by the recent ﬁnding that mutations in RASA1 cause a
human venous malformation syndrome (48). As we observed
a signiﬁcant inactivation of Nf1 in CD31-positive endothelial
cells from Nf1Prx1 mice,
the pathomechanism of vascular
abnormalities is likely to have the same basis. Further
studies will be needed to identify and characterize the
involved pathways, but an important role of Nf1 and Ras in
the development of vessels has become apparent.

In summary, our results document an important role of Nf1
in several aspects of skeletal development. Many of the
observed features overlap with those found in FGF activation,
thus linking the pathways. Our results indicate that NF1
associated skeletal abnormalities are caused by a primary
defect in osteoblasts and/or chondrocyte differentiation due
to inactivation of the NF1 gene.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mouse breeding and genotyping

We genotyped NF1ﬂox and Rosa26-LacZ mice using a PCR
approach as described previously (11). See Supplementary
Material for primers used for detection of the Cre transgene
in Prx1-Cre mouse line. All experimental procedures were
approved by the ‘Landesamt fu¨r Gesundheitsschutz und Tech-
nische Sicherheit (LaGeTSi), Berlin, Germany.

Protein and mRNA analysis

Whole cell lysates of passage 2 primary articular chondrocytes
and calvarial osteoblasts were resolved by electrophoresis
in SDS – polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF
(Amersham). For western blot analysis, membranes were
probed with the antibodies: phospho-p42/44 (pERK1/2)
#9102 (Cell Signaling), p44 (ERK1) #4372 (Cell Signaling),
p42 (ERK2) #9108 (Cell Signaling), p21/Waf1 sc-6246
(Santa Cruz), Sox9 sc-20095 (Santa Cruz), Osteopontin
(MPIIIB101; DSHB) and Actin A5060 (Sigma). The Ras
Activation Assay Kit (Upstate) was used according to manu-

facturer’s guidelines in wild-type or Nf1Prx1 mouse derived
chondrocytes. RNA was isolated from trypsinized cells using
Total RNA isolation Kit (AABiot Gdynia, Poland). Reverse
transcription was performed with SuperscriptII (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Gene expression was
assessed by ampliﬁcation of the gene of interest with Gapdh
as endogenous control on a Taqman 7500 (ABI) by the
SYBR green method. Primer sequences are available as
Supplementary Material.

Histology, histomorphometry and in situ hybridization

For the histological analysis, embryos were ﬁxed with 4% par-
aformaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn. For histology and
histomorphometry, bones were processed as previously
described (49). TRAP histochemistry was performed on
5 mm sections of parafﬁn-embedded tibiae. The reaction
occurred at 378C in 40 mM acetate buffer pH 5.0 containing
10 mM sodium tartrate using 10 mg/ml naphthol-AS-MX-
phosphate (Sigma) and 600 mg/l
fast-red-violet LB-salt
(Sigma) as substrate. Sections were counterstained in 0.5%
light green SF yellowish (Sigma). Quantitative analysis of
TRAP-positive regions was performed with the image analysis
software Axiovision (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (50). In situ
hybridization on frozen sections of E13.5 and E14.5
embryos was performed with digoxygenin-labeled rRNA
probe as described (19).

For in vivo BrdU labeling, newborn pups were injected with
100 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) and sacriﬁced 8 h
later.

Immunohistological stainings

7 mm parafﬁn sections were subjected to pH 6.0 citrate buffer/
microwave antigen retrieval. Staining was performed with
anti-BrdU #1-299-964 antibody (Roche) 1:100, anti Sox9
H-90 antibodies (Santa Cruz) at 1:400 and anti CD34 Mec
14.7 (Abcam) antibody at 1:100.

Three-dimensional imaging by mCT and OPT

Bone specimens were scanned at 32 mm resolution using a
prototype mCT scanner. Three-dimensional
reconstruction
was done by the Amira software version 3.1. (51). Alizarin
red/ Alcian blue stained skeletal preparations were scanned
by the OPT method, which accumulates projection images
of a entire specimen from many different angles and recal-
culates the original three-dimensional structure by using a
‘back-projection’ reconstruction algorithm (52). OPT-Scans
were performed with UV light
in darkﬁeld illumination
the complete
using GFP1 and Texas-Red ﬁlters to detect
morphology and the Alizarin red staining,
respectively.
Another OPT-Scan in brightﬁeld illumination detected the
Alcian blue staining. Virtual sections of the original three-
dimensional reconstructions can be viewed at free angles
and analyzed using the free software of
the Edinburgh
Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP, http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/).
QuickTime movies were generated in the IPLab software
from ScanAnalytics.

BSE microscopy and nanoindentation

BSE images were obtained using environmental scanning
electron microscope operated at accelerating voltage of
12.5 kV under low vacuum as previously described (16).
The sample to detector distance was 10 mm. All the images
were taken at 800 magniﬁcation in the mid-shaft region of
two
bone. To calculate the relative porosity in the bone,
areas, each of about 75  175 mm from each sample were
used and converted into gray scales. Nanoindentation testing
was performed using a scanning nanoindenter
(Hysitron
Ubi1, USA) with a Berkovich diamond indenter tip as pre-
viously described (16). The indents were performed using a
maximum force of 5000 mN with a hold time of 60 s
at maximum force. Er, nanoindentation modulus measured
(in GPa), reﬂects the stiffness of the material determined
based on the slope of the unloading curve in the region of
20 – 95% of maximum load.

Primary osteoblast, osteoclast and chondrocyte culture

Primary osteoblasts were isolated from calvariae of P3 wt and
Nf1Prx1 mice by digestion with 0,1% collagenase for
230 min at 378C. Cells were seeded at a density of
2104/cm2 in cell culture ﬂasks and cultured in aMEM
with 10% FCS. After reaching conﬂuency, the cells were
stimulated by adding 10 mM b-glycerolphosphate
and
0.28 mM ascorbic acid to the culture medium (day 0). Cells
were cultured until day 12. Quantitative ALP and mineraliz-
ation assays were performed at days 4, 8 and 12 of culture
as previously described (53). Brieﬂy, ALP activity was deter-
mined by homogenizing three replicates separately in ALP-
buffer1 (0.1 M glycine, 1% NP-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
ZnCl2). After the addition of 1 vol of ALP-buffer2 [5 mM
p-nitrophenyl phosphate ( p-NPP), 0.1 M glycine, pH 9.6,
1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ZnCl2], reactions were incubated at
378C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 1 M NaOH. The
amount of p-NP released from the substrate p-NPP was
recorded at 405 nm. ALP activity is given as unit of absorp-
tion/mg protein/30 min.

Parallel to the ALP assay, mineralization was monitored by
Alizarin red staining. Osteoclast precursors were isolated from
bone marrow and cultured as described by Takeshita et al.
(54). Chondrocytes were isolated from hyaline cartilage of
P4 knee and elbow joints using previously described
methods (55). Brieﬂy, cartilage was dissected free of ﬁbrous
tissue and bone, and stored overnight at 48C in DMEM
medium before proceeding with the collagenase digestion. In
order to minimize non-cartilaginous cell contamination, two
steps of digests were done, each at 378C for 1 h, and only
cells from second one were harvested. Second passage cells
were used in all experiments.

FACS sorting of endothelial cells

Lung tissue was minced and digested in 0.1% collagenase/
PBS for 1 h at 378C. Long bones were minced and washed
in PBS. Cell suspensions were incubated with an FITC-labeled
anti-CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen), washed and cell
sorting was performed according to standard procedures.

Statistical analysis

Analysis of histomorphometric results was performed using

n ¼ 5 animals and 20 sections per group. All values were
the mean + SD. The statistical difference
expressed as
between the two groups was examined using Student’s
P , 0.05; 
unpaired t-test. 

P , 0.01.
