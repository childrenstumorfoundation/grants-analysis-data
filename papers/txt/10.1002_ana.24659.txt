Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer derived from cells of neural crest origin. The hallmarks of its enigmatic charac-
ter include its propensity for spontaneous regression under some circumstances and its association with paraneoplas-
tic opsoclonus, myoclonus, and ataxia. The neurodevelopmental underpinnings of its origins may provide important
clues for development of novel therapeutic and preventive agents for this frequently fatal malignancy and for the
associated paraneoplastic syndromes.

Neuroblastoma as an Aberration of
Neural Crest Development

Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the sympathetic gan-

glia and adrenal medulla, structures derived from the
embryonic neural crest. Over one third of neuroblastomas
are diagnosed in infants, and 75% are diagnosed by 5 years
of age. It is important to improve neuroblastoma treatment
because neuroblastomas account for 15% of all pediatric
cancer deaths, despite representing only 8% of new diagno-
ses and affecting only 1 in every 8,000 live births. Neuro-
blastoma can be viewed as resulting from a failure of neural
crest cell differentiation, so understanding normal neural
crest differentiation may help identify novel targets for
neuroblastoma therapy and, potentially, prevention.1

Normal trunk neural crest cells leave the dorsal aspect
of the neural tube, migrate ventrally, close to the neural
tube, and begin to differentiate in response to local cues
(Fig 1). Some of them differentiate into neurons of the
sympathetic ganglia or sympathetic neuron-like chromaffin
cells of the adrenal medulla in response to such cues as
bone morphogenetic protein from the nearby dorsal aorta.2
Neurons promote the differentiation of adjacent neural

crest-derived cells into Schwann cells (associated with neu-
ral axons), and satellite cells (associated with neural cell
bodies).3

Neuroblastomas and neuroblastoma cell lines contain
cells that resemble immature sympathetic neurons (some-
times called N-type cells) and Schwann cells (S-type cells).
Because patients whose tumors have higher proportions of
Schwann cells have better outcomes,
the relationship
between the cell subtypes has been a source of some discus-
sion. MYCN gene amplification occurs in approximately
22% of neuroblastoma, and it is a hallmark of the most
aggressive tumors. This is not to say that MYCN does not
play any role in non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas;
even in normal neural crest, MYCN functions to maintain
the pluripotent, proliferative state of, prevent differentia-
tion of, and, ironically and in the right microenvironment,
promote apoptosis in neuroblasts.4 MYCN amplification is
present in immature neuronal neuroblastoma cells, but it is
rarely found in Schwann-like neuroblastoma cells, which

development, neural crest cells (pink) form at the dorsal aspect of the neural tube (red) and migrate laterally or medially
(black arrows). (B) Slightly later in development, some of the medially migrating neural crest cells differentiate into sympa-
thoadrenal precursor cells (pink with green outline). These can give rise to mature sympathetic neurons (green), adrenal chro-
maffin cells (gray), and Schwann cells (purple). (C) In mature vertebrates, the sympathetic ganglia contain sympathetic
neurons. The adrenal medulla, a sympathetic ganglion-like structure, contains adrenal chromaffin cells. Schwann cells reside in
sympathetic ganglia and dorsal root ganglia, and populate all spinal nerves. Schwann-like satellite cells associate with sympa-
thetic and dorsal root ganglia. The adrenal medulla also contains Schwann-like cells.

but that only neuron-like cells show chromosomal changes.6
Dialog between neuroblastoma cells and Schwann cells can
be driven by increased neuroblastoma cell expression of
neuregulin-1, a major Schwann cell mitogen.7 Recruitment
of normal Schwann cells by mutant neurons may account
for most of the mixed cellular phenotype characteristic of
neuroblastomas. Alternatively,
the
Schwannian cells in undifferentiated neuroblastomas may
differ from that in mature ganglioneuromas; that is, Schwan-
nian neuroblastoma cells may derive from the malignant
clone, whereas Schwann cells in mature ganglioneuromas
may be normal Schwann cells.

the cell of origin of

Normal neural crest cells are characterized by their
ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell
types.8 Importantly, stem cell properties can be reacquired
by differentiated neural crest derivatives.9 The ability of
cells to self-renew and differentiate along multiple lineages
is also a feature of the stem/precursor-like cells found in
cancers. Tumor stem/progenitor cells may occur when
mature cells dedifferentiate in response to genetic and epi-
genetic alterations and/or if developing cells accumulate
genetic and epigenetic alterations. It remains to be deter-
mined which is true of neuroblastoma, but the fact that
neuroblastoma is a disease of childhood, and the mainte-
nance of protein expression and post-translational modifi-
cation patterns characteristic of embryonal neural crest in
neuroblastomas10 support the latter model. Neuroblastoma

such as

tumors and neuroblastoma cell lines, in addition to neu-
ron- and Schwann cell–like cells, may also contain stem-
like cells (I-type cells). These stem-like cells express stem
cell markers, are more tumorigenic than other neuron-like
cells on xenotransplantation, and can develop into imma-
ture neurons with elevated expression of sympathetic/
adrenal markers,
and
dopamine-b-hydroxylase, on exposure to retinoic acid
(RA11). Other culture conditions can induce Schwann-like
phenotypes.12 They can also form secondary spheres in cul-
ture (self-renew). In neuroblastoma cell lines, miR-101 and
one of its targets, LaminA, may control neuroblastoma
stem-like
tumor-propagating
properties.13 Therefore, neuroblastoma stem-like cells
meet criteria for stem-like or progenitor cells (multilineage
differentiation) and tumor-initiating cells, and ongoing
efforts are aimed at ablating these cells, and/or forcing their
differentiation.

The precise cell of origin of neuroblastoma remains
unknown. Neural crest cell-derived neuroblasts may be one
cell of origin. MYCN amplification is characteristic of a
subset of human neuroblastomas. When a tyrosine hydroy-
lase promoter drives expression of MYCN in mouse neuro-
blasts, mature sympathetic neurons, and cells of the adrenal
medulla, neuroblastomas develop.14 With MYCN expres-

alterations in SAPs may be required to drive tumorigenesis.
Alternatively,

must occur in neuroblasts for neuroblastoma to form

its effectiveness

The shared plasticity of neuroblastoma cells and
developing neural crest stem cells inspired the idea that
cell differentiation might be an effective neuroblastoma
therapy. The possibility that neuroblastoma cells could be
differentiated into Schwann cells has not yet been studied
therapeutically. RA treatment causes differentiation of
immature neuron-like cells into more mature neurons in
vitro;
remains uncertain.
However, neuroblastoma cells with mutations in NF1, a
negative regulator of Ras signaling, fail to differentiate in
response to RA, and blocking mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) signaling downstream of
NF1 mutation enhances effects of RA.16 Indeed, muta-
tions in Ras-MAPK signaling pathway genes are found
in 78% of relapsed neuroblastoma.17 Combined MEK
inhibition and RA therapy has not yet been tested in
patients, but
it might be considered as a rational
approach to inducing neuronal differentiation.

Understanding the Phenomenon of
Spontaneous Regression
Clinically, neuroblastoma is known for heterogeneous
clinical behavior, from spontaneous regression or differ-
entiation, to relentless progression despite intensive, mul-
timodality therapy. However,
is the propensity for
spontaneous regression that makes this tumor so fascinat-
ing. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms
responsible for spontaneous
regression might help to
identify alternative therapeutic approaches. Several mech-
anisms have been proposed to explain the phenomenon
of spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas,
including
neurotrophin deprivation, humoral or cellular immune
response, loss of telomerase activity, or alterations in epi-
genetic regulation.18

Neuroblastoma has the highest rate of spontaneous
regression of any human cancer.19,20 Clinically, spontane-
ous regression of neuroblastoma was codified as a specific
stage of disseminated neuroblastoma in infants with a gen-
erally good prognosis, known as IVS (now 4S or MS).
However, this was just the most dramatic example of spon-
taneous regression, which can be observed in infants with
any stage of disease if they have biologically favorable
tumors.21,22 This conclusion is further supported by mass
screening studies, in which screened populations demon-
strated a doubled or tripled neuroblastoma prevalence and

Ratner et al: The “Neuro” of Neuroblastoma

no change in overall mortality from neuroblastoma.23,24
The increased prevalence of neuroblastoma observed in the
screened populations was likely attributable to detection of
tumors (of all stages) that would otherwise have regressed
spontaneously, and indeed the prevalence of spontaneous
regression was at least as high as the prevalence of clinically
detected neuroblastomas.23,24 Furthermore, almost all
tumors detected by mass screening were biologically favor-
able, suggesting that biologically favorable tumors rarely
evolve into biologically unfavorable tumors.25

tems, and they also have important roles in neuroblas-

toma
associated with favorable clinical and biological features,
such as younger patient age,
lower tumor stage, and
absence of MYCN amplification, and these patients have
an excellent outcome.28,29 In contrast, TrkB is coex-
pressed at high levels with its ligand, brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF),
in clinically and biologically
unfavorable tumors, especially those with MYCN amplifi-
cation.30 Activation of the TrkB-BDNF autocrine path-
way can lead to invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and
drug resistance.30–32 Tumors expressing high levels of
TrkA undergo neuronal differentiation in vitro when
exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF), but the same cells
die within a week if deprived of NGF.29,33 Thus, culture
conditions recapitulate the behavior of TrkA-expressing
neuroblastomas, which undergo neuronal differentiation
or spontaneous regression, depending on the presence or
absence of NGF in their microenvironment.

Migrating neural crest precursors (and favorable neu-
roblastomas that express TrkA) survive despite a lack of
available NGF in their microenvironment. This could
result from expression of TrkAIII, which is a constitutively
active, alternatively spliced isoform.34 Thus, the conversion
from a TrkA-expressing, NGF-independent neuroblastoma
to a NGF-dependent tumor could be the consequence of a
developmentally programmed isoform switch from TrkAIII
to TrkA. Alternatively, NGF-independent neuroblastomas
could depend on another receptor or pathway for survival,
and then switch dependence to TrkA, only to undergo apo-
ptosis and regress in the absence of ligand (see Fig 2). How-
ever, the available data are most consistent with a TrkA
dependence mechanism accounting for spontaneous regres-
sion of neuroblastomas.

Spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas and other
types of cancer can sometimes follow an acute infection.
Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been
observed in neuroblastomas, and there is evidence for the
presence of both tumor-targeted T cells and antineural

FIGURE 2: Mechanisms of
regression.
Shown are the major mechanisms that have been proposed
to explain the phenomenon of neuroblastoma regression in
infants. Three of the mechanisms (telomere shortening,
TrkA-mediated apoptosis in the absence of NGF, and epi-
genetic changes) likely lead to apoptosis and programmed
cell death. However, cellular or humoral immune response
to tumor antigens would likely lead to direct,
immune-
mediated killing of neuroblastoma cells. NGF 5 nerve

antibodies in patients with neuroblastoma.35 Thus, one
possible mechanism of spontaneous regression could be a
consequence of a host-mediated immune response. Inter-
estingly, the paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia
syndrome (OMAS) is associated with the presence of anti-
neural antibodies and a favorable outcome in patients with
neuroblastoma (see section on “Neuroimmunology of
OMAS” below).36,37 Around 40% of patients with OMAS
have neuroblastoma, which suggests that the other 60%
either had a neuroblastoma that regressed, or they have a
de novo autoimmune disease. Neuroblastoma cells from
patients with high-risk disease may evade immune destruc-
tion by downregulating human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
class I molecules.38 However, most tumors from patients
with stage 4S neuroblastoma express normal levels of HLA
class I antigens.39 Upregulation of class I expression in neu-
roblastoma cells can be induced by interferon-c,38 which
suggests that upregulation of HLA class I in vivo might be
used to augment immune surveillance and promote tumor
regression.

Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of
chromosomes that are important for the replication and
stability of chromosomes. The regulation of the telomere
length is controlled, in part, by expression of the enzyme
telomerase, which is
frequently high in cancer and
immortalized cells, but low in most normal and senescent
cells.4 Hiyama et al40 studied the regulation of telomere
length and activity of the telomerase in 100 samples of
neuroblastomas. Most of
the tumors that exhibited a
high level of telomerase activity were associated with a

poor prognosis, and all tumors with MYCN amplifica-
tion had high telomerase activity. Interestingly, most of
the tumor samples from 4S neuroblastoma had low telo-
merase activity or short telomeres, a pattern that is usu-
ally associated with senescent cells.41 These data suggest
that loss of telomerase activity is a biologically plausible
mechanism to explain spontaneous regression of neuro-
blastoma and, possibly, of other tumors. However, low
telomerase activity is also associated with other biologi-
cally favorable features of predominantly low-risk tumors,
so the independent role of telomerase is not clear.

Changes in gene expression related to alterations in
promoter DNA methylation, histone modification, chro-
matin remodeling, or other mechanisms might also
impact the survival
in neuroblastoma cells. Epigenetic
changes affecting expression of genes relevant to neuro-
blastoma development were initially reported more than
a decade ago, and several studies have suggested that
alterations in gene methylation and histone modification
are related to patient outcome.42 The correlation between
epigenetic changes and neuroblastoma behavior has been
increasingly studied, particularly because next-generation
sequencing analyses of neuroblastoma have reported a
very limited number of previously unrecognized recurrent
somatic mutations.43 Therefore, epigenetic changes might
help to explain poorly understood aspects of disease
presentation and clinical behavior.44

Thus, there are several possible mechanisms that
could explain the phenomenon of spontaneous regression
of neuroblastomas,
including neurotrophin deprivation,
immune-mediated destruction, loss of telomerase causing
telomere shortening, developmentally regulated epigenetic
changes, or other mechanisms. Indeed, it is possible that
different mechanisms are responsible for
spontaneous
regression in individual cases.18 There are currently no
animal models of neuroblastoma that mimic the sponta-
neous regression observed in 4S disease.45 Our challenge
will be to better understand what triggers regression and
develop therapeutic strategies that take advantage of this
understanding to treat infants with biologically targeted
therapies.

Neuroimmunology of OMAS
OMAS is a rare, enigmatic brain syndrome that can
occur from infancy to adulthood, but the median age of
onset in pediatric cohorts is in the second year of life. In
its full form, the clinical syndrome is highly recognizable
with multidirectional fast saccadic bursts of conjugate eye
movements
(opsoclonus), arrhythmic random jerks of
limbs, face, and trunk (myoclonus), and ataxia. Irritabil-
ity,
sleep disturbance, and behavioral and cognitive
regression are common accompaniments. OMAS has a

paraneoplastic association with neural crest tumors (neu-
roblastoma, neuroganglioma, etc.) in approximately 40%
of cases.46,47 Other cases of OMAS occur as an infectious
process or, more commonly, a para- or postinfectious
process. In some patients, there is evidence of tumor and
infection. OMAS complicates only 2% to 3% of all neu-
roblastoma cases.37 Searching for a neural crest tumor in
OMAS patients typically involves imaging and metabolic

Patients with OMAS have better outcomes from a
tumor perspective than neuroblastoma patients without
OMAS. Rudnick et al showed that metastatic disease
occurs in only 2 of 21 (10%) of neuroblastoma patients
with OMAS, compared to 229 of 654 (35%) of neuro-
blastoma patients without OMAS.16 Likewise, survival is
better in OMAS-neuroblastoma patients compared to
neuroblastoma patients without OMAS.37 Pathological
examination has shown that in OMAS patients with neu-
roblastoma, the tumor typically has a dense inflammatory
cell infiltrate (CD20 B cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells),
whereas inflammatory cell
infiltrate is less common in
tumors uncomplicated by OMAS.49
neuroblastoma
These tumor data support the hypothesis that OMAS is
associated with a pronounced autoreactive
immune
response against the tumor.

The immunology of OMAS has been studied in sur-
prising detail for a rare disease,50–61 although no unifying
immune biomarker has yet been identified and the syn-
drome remains a clinical diagnosis. Because of the presence
of the key features of opsoclonus, myoclonus, and ataxia,
the brainstem and cerebellum have been considered to be
the primary sites of immunological attack; this is supported
by imaging studies.50 Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament is
elevated in acute OMAS patients, suggesting that neurons
are the primary cellular target.51 Autoantibodies have been
a focus of interest in OMAS, and the recent discoveries of
cell surface autoantibodies associated with autoimmune
encephalitis syndromes has led to the hypothesis that
OMAS could be a “cell surface autoantibody syndrome”;
however, there is evidence for a cell surface antibody in
only a minority of patients with OMAS.53 Children with
OMAS are typically negative for classic onconeuronal anti-
bodies (such as anti-Hu, Ri, and Yo), and using immunhis-
tochemistry against brain tissue sections,54 OMAS patients
often are found to have immunoglobulin G binding to
neuronal tissue without a common binding pattern to sug-

cells and humoral immunity has been suggested,55–58 as
have T-cell mechanisms.59–61 A cartoon summarizing the
basic immunological mechanisms thought to be involved is
shown in Figure 3.

Historical outcome data have shown that OMAS has
the potential to be a devastating disease, with permanent
motor and cognitive disability a common outcome.47
Patients with relapsing disease do worse than patients with
monophasic disease, emphasizing the therapeutic principle
of inducing remission and trying to prevent relapses with
chronic immune suppression in patients with severe dis-
ease.47 Although there are no randomized, controlled trials
in OMAS, there are reasonable cohort studies (retrospec-
tive and prospective) to show that for patients with severe
disease, multimodal therapy (adrenocorticotrophic hor-
mone or corticosteroids plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
or steroid sparing immune suppression) do better than
patients given corticosteroids and intravenous immuno-
globulin alone.62,63 More-modern aggressive immune sup-
pression appears to convey better outcomes in cognition
and motor scores compared to historical treatments,63 and
early treatment with rituximab appears to improve out-
comes compared to later treatment64; however, it should be
emphasized that none of these studies were randomized or
controlled.

In summary, OMAS is a paraneoplastic or infection-
associated, immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS)
syndrome, which is probably immunologically complex and
possibly heterogeneous. Clinical and histological tumor data

has been aimed at compounds on the cell surface (GD2; ALK;

suggest that there is a robust immune response against the
tumor in OMAS patients, and this immune response may
confer tumor outcome benefits at
the expense of an
“autoreactive” immune response against the brain. As is true
for many immune-mediated CNS disorders, early recogni-
tion and early treatment improve outcomes.

Targeted Therapy for Neuroblastoma: A
Developmental Neurobiological Approach
Targeted therapy for cancer aims to attack cancer cells
while leaving normal cells unscathed. In the case of
developmental neoplasms,
this may mean identifying
therapeutic targets that are expressed during embryogene-
sis or early postnatal life but are not expressed, seques-
tered in a drug-inaccessible intracellular compartment, or
downregulated in more mature stages. As such, efforts to
identify targets uniquely found in neural crest cells or
uniquely expressed in neoplastic neural crest cell deriva-
tives have been vigorous, but such targets are neither
plentiful nor easy to attack.1 To date, clinically or pre-
clinically developed approaches have been aimed at out-
facing targets on the exterior cell surface; transmembrane
targets that bridge between the extracellular and intracel-
lular compartments; intracellular targets; and, in the case
of paraneoplastic effects of neuroblastoma, systemic tar-
gets extrinsic to the neuroblastoma cell itself (Fig 4).

The best-studied target on the exterior surface of the
neuroblastoma cell is the ganglioside, disialganglioside 2
(GD2). Preclinically studied anti-GD2 therapeutics use
GD2 as a cellular address and depend on conjugation of
the GD2-binding agent to a toxin or drug to trigger a cyto-
lytic cascade.65 Proposed anti-GD2 antibodies have been
conjugated to 131I, DNA-damaging drugs, microtubule
disrupting drugs, diphtheria or Pseudomonas toxin, and
nanoparticles loaded with toxic drugs in an attempt to tar-
get cytolysis to neuroblastoma cells. A recent phase II study
of consolidation therapy with anti-GD2 antibodies plus
isotretinoin demonstrated enhanced rate and duration of
complete or very good partial response in patients with
high-risk neuroblastoma who relapsed after first remis-
sion.66 Unfortunately, treatment of neuroblastoma with
targeted immunotherapy using chimeric anti-GD2 mono-
clonal antibodies also attacks pain fibers and is associated
with significant pain, requiring management with a high-
dose opioid infusion.66
Transmembrane

include neurotransmitter
receptors and the monoamine uptake system. Whereas
these are neither required for cell survival nor unique to
neuroblastoma cells, neuroblastoma is a peripheral nervous
system tumor, and toxic or toxin-conjugated neurotrans-
mitter analogues can at least be made sufficiently polar as
not to be CNS permeant.68,69 One of the first toxic neuro-
transmitter analogues proposed for use in targeted therapy
of neuroblastoma was 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). 6-
OHDA is not distributed centrally after peripheral admin-
istration; it enters neurons through the monoamine uptake
system and generates toxic reactive oxygen species in situ,
thereby killing the cells. In vitro and preclinical studies
showed the promise of 6-OHDA alone68,70 and in combi-
nation with normal cell-selective free radical scavengers.71
But the cumulative toxicity of 6-OHDA and the selective
free radical scavengers precluded their utility as adjunctive
agents for neuroblastoma therapy. Another strategy, using
6-mercaptodopamine
reduction-
activated antimitotic prodrugs in neuroblastoma cells,69
was hampered by the limited shelf-life of this catechol-
amine analogue.

But neurotransmitter analogues turn out to be use-
ful both as therapeutic agents and as diagnostic aids in
imaging of neuroblastoma. MIBG is a catecholamine
analogue that can be labeled with 123I for scintigraphy
and with 131I for focused radiotherapy for neuroblas-
toma. Recently, 124I-MIBG positron emission tomogra-
phy/CT has
also been proposed for detection of
neuroblastoma.72 The sensitivity of 123I-MIBG scintigra-
phy ranges from 67% to 100% in studies of biopsy-
proven neuroblastoma and approximately 10% of neuro-
blastomas do not take up MIBG.73 The response rate to

neuroblastoma therapy. Studies aimed at blocking protec-
tive signaling and potentiating death signaling in neuro-
blastoma cells have informed much of our understanding
of NGF signaling and its downstream effects. But,
unfortunately, depending upon the degree to which and
the milieu in which it is expressed, either receptor can be
pro- or antiapoptotic. Furthermore, from cell to cell in a

single tumor at a single time, the expression and down-
stream effects of TrkA and p75NTR vary widely.75–77
This between- and within-tumor variability would make
the design of drugs with predictable effects on neuroblas-
toma near impossible.

The B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins are
also arbiters of life-death decision making and are both
membrane bound and cytoplasmic in localization. In view
of the expression of and signaling through antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members by neuroblastoma78,79 and the redox
effects of Bcl-2 on neural cells,80 the antineuroblastoma
efficacy of the reduction-activated chemotherapeutic agent,
neocarzinostatin, was hypothesized to be enhanced by over-
expression of Bcl-2. This is indeed the case,81,82 raising the
prospect of using neocarzinostatin and other enediyne pro-
drugs as chemotherapy for neuroblastoma. In fact, treat-
ment of neuroblastoma cells with neocarzinostatin in vitro
also led to caspase 3–mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 to a
proapoptotic fragment,83–85 and tumor xenografts that
expressed both Bcl-2 and caspase 3, but not one or the
other, demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to neocarzinosta-
tin in a nude mouse model.83 This finding has been extrap-
olated to other tumors of the nervous system as well.86

The pathogenesis of neuroblastoma has been
hypothesized to include maturational arrest of neural
crest precursor cells.10 As such, intracellular targets for
neuroblastoma therapy have included proteins involved
in induction and enactment of differentiation. The fur-
thest along the therapeutic pipeline of these is the family
of RA receptors, most commonly targeted with 13-cis-
RA. Studies of 13-cis-RA as postconsolidation therapy
after bone marrow transplantation are promising, but
lack statistical power to definitively say whether or not it
is effective in high-risk neuroblastoma.87

(Kidins220) induced Schwannian differentiation in neu-
roblastoma cells in vitro, a finding that is of interest
because Schwann cell–like neuroblastomas are thought to
be less aggressive clinically than neural or stem cell–like
neuroblastomas. This raises the possibility of altering the
malignant character, rather than the survival, of neuro-
blastoma cells as a therapeutic adjunct.88

One characteristic of the high-risk neuroblastoma is
amplification and overexpression of the oncogene, MYCN.
ALK is a target gene of N-Myc (MYCN) protein, and
mutations of ALK underlie many cases of hereditary neuro-
blastoma.89 However, MYCN and anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) have proven to be difficult targets, both
because of their promiscuous signaling roles in normal
developing cells and because of the development of resist-
ance to drugs aimed at them. A search is ongoing for down-
stream effectors of MYCN and ALK in neuroblastoma cells

that might serve as effective therapeutic targets. Eyes absent
homolog 1 (EYA1) and sine oculis-related homeobox 3
(SIX3), two proteins important in normal eye and ear
development, appear promising in this regard.90

In contrast to the targeting of markers of malignancy
of neural crest cells in neuroblastoma itself, the biology tar-
geted for treatment of neuroblastoma-related OMAS is sys-
temic immunoreactivity that may be triggered by the
tumor, but does not depend on its persistence (see above
section on “Neuroimmunology of OMAS”). In recent
years, as biological response modifiers and monoclonal
antibody therapies have matured, so has the antiparaneo-
plastic syndrome armamentarium. There is now evidence
for efficacy of rituximab, ofatumumab, and mycophenolate
mofetil in children with OMAS associated with a history of
neuroblastoma.63,91,92

Although neuroblastoma is generally the clinical prov-
ince of pediatric oncologists, the developmental origins,
oncogenic events, and potential therapeutic targets are proc-
esses and molecular entities familiar to developmental and
molecular neurobiologists. Many contributions have already
been made by the neurology and neurobiology communities
to our understanding of and clinical approach to neuroblas-
toma,1,4,9,93 and ongoing clinical trials for neuroblastoma
reflect the work of multidisciplinary consortia (Table). We
anticipate that the interactions and collaborations among
pediatric neurologists, neurobiologists, and pediatric oncolo-
gists will only become stronger as our understanding of neu-
ral crest development continues to grow.
