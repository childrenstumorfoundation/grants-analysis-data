Abstract

Alcohol-mediated cancers represent more than 3.5% of cancer-related deaths, yet how alcohol promotes cancer is a
major open question. Using Drosophila, we identified novel interactions between dietary ethanol and loss of tumor
suppressor  components  of  the  Hippo  Pathway.  The  Hippo  Pathway  suppresses  tumors  in  flies  and  mammals  by
inactivating transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, and the spectrum of cancers associated with impaired Hippo signaling
overlaps strikingly with those associated with alcohol. Therefore, our findings may implicate loss of Hippo Pathway
tumor suppression in alcohol-mediated cancers. Ethanol enhanced overgrowth from loss of the expanded, hippo, or
warts tumor suppressors but, surprisingly, not from over-expressing the yorkie oncogene. We propose that in parallel
to Yorkie-dependent overgrowth, impairing Hippo signaling in the presence of alcohol may promote overgrowth via
additional  alcohol-relevant  targets.  We  also  identified  interactions  between  alcohol  and  Hippo  Pathway  over-
activation. We propose that exceeding certain thresholds of alcohol exposure activates Hippo signaling to maintain
proper growth control and prevent alcohol-mediated mis-patterning and tissue overgrowth.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor in cancers of
tissues that contact or metabolize alcohol (for example, upper
aerodigestive tract and liver cancers) and also in other tissues
such  as  breast  cancer  [1-16].  Alcohol-associated  cancers  are
responsible for more than 3.5% of all cancer deaths, yet how
alcohol  causes  cancer  remains  a  major  open  question.
functional  genetic
Drosophila  are  amenable 
to  rigorous 
analysis  and  descriptive  phenotypic 
characterizations.
Drosophila models have been established to explore the role of
alcohol  in  health  contexts  including  models  of  fetal  alcohol
syndrome  and  alcohol  addiction  [17-23]  as  well  as  cancer-
relevant  phenotypes  such  as  tissue  overgrowth  [24-26]  in  a
whole-animal model making it a particularly relevant system to
investigate the relationship between alcohol and cancer where
systemic  responses  could  underlie 
the  pathogenesis  of
disease.

We identified novel interactions between dietary ethanol and
the  Hippo  Tumor  Suppressor  Pathway,  a  signaling  network
highly  conserved  from  flies  to  mammals.  The  Hippo  Pathway
acts  as  a  master  regulatory  pathway  to  restrict  growth  and
proliferation  and  to  promote  apoptosis,  and  its  disruption  is
implicated  in  a  number  of  cancers  [27-34].  Hippo  (Hpo;  Mst1
and Mst2 in mammals) [35-39] is the upstream kinase in a core
cassette  in  which  activated  Hpo  kinase  associates  with
Salvador 
[40,41]  and
phosphorylates  and  activates  downstream  effector  kinase
Warts (Wts; Lats1 and Lats2 in mammals) [40,42,43] and Wts
co-activator Mats (Mob1 in mammals) [44]. Wts phosphorylates
and  inhibits  transcriptional  co-activator  Yorkie  (Yki;  YAP  and
TAZ in mammals) [45], a potent oncogene. Components of this
core cassette can be regulated by distinct upstream factors to
define  the  eventual  biological  outputs.  For  example,  GPCR
signaling regulates Wts directly [46], Sik kinases regulate Sav
[47], and a set of FERM-domain proteins including Merlin (Mer)

(Sav1  or  hWW45 

in  mammals)

and Expanded (Ex) act upstream to activate Hpo by an as yet
undefined mechanism [48].

We found that alcohol exposure enhanced overgrowth upon
Hippo  Pathway  attenuation  in  multiple  organs  in  Drosophila.
Surprisingly,  alcohol  did  not  enhance  overgrowth  from  over-
expressing yki, suggesting the Hippo pathway may target yki-
independent growth regulators that are alcohol-responsive. We
also found that high doses of alcohol enhanced phenotypes of
hpo  over-expression.  Our  studies  reveal  multiple  interactions
between  alcohol  and  the  Hippo  Pathway  and  suggest  a
previously  undescribed  role  for  Hippo  signaling  to  prevent
tissue overgrowth upon alcohol exposure.

Materials and Methods

Drosophila tools

RNAi  was  achieved  using  inverted  repeat  alleles  from  the
Transgenic  RNAi  Project 
for  hpo  (P{TRiP.JF02740}attP2,
referred  to  here  as  hpoIRT),  for  Mer  (P{TRiP.JF02841}attP2,
MerIRT), and for ex (P{TRiP.JF03120}attP2, exIRT), and from the
National Institute of Genetics for wts (12072R-2, wtsIRN) and for
yki  (4005R-2,  ykiIRN).  Mosaic  analysis  utilized  the  FLP/FRT
system  [49]  including  the  stocks  y  w  eyFLP;  FRT42D  pW+
UbiGFP/SM6-TM6B and w; FRT42D hpoMGH1. Over-expression
of  transgenes  used  stocks  UAS  ykiV5,  UAS  FLAGyki,  UAS
ykiS168AGFP.HA,  and  UAS  hpo.  Screen  crosses  and  other
experimental crosses were reared on Formula 4-24 Blue food
(Carolina  Biological)  reconstituted  from  1  gram  of  food  flakes
per  4  milliliters  of  the  specified  doses  of  ethanol  or  water.
Previous studies established that alcohol doses in food decline
over time [50]; we exploited this to try to recapitulate the human
scenario  of  periodic  alcohol  exposure,  not  constant  alcohol
exposure,  food  in  each  vial  was  supplemented  with  300
microliters of ethanol at the specified dose every other day.

Drosophila alcohol screen

To  identify  interactions  between  alcohol  and  overgrowth
models,  or  alcohol  and  alterations  in  signaling  pathways,  we
utilized both (1) Gal4/UAS [51] and (2) FLP/FRT systems [49]
to generate contexts of tissue overgrowth in an ongoing screen
(1).  We  crossed  tissue-specific  gal4  drivers  (including  wing
drivers  engal4,  c765gal4,  eye  driver  eygal4,  etc.)  to  UAS
transgenes that direct RNAi or over-expression of genes known
to cause tissue overgrowth or participate in signaling cascades
on  food  sources  containing  a  range  of  ethanol  or  water  only.
We  considered  positive  hits  those  genes  whose  overgrowth
phenotypes  were  enhanced  when  larvae  were  reared  in  the
presence of ethanol (2). We crossed eyFLP-containing stocks
to corresponding FRT chromosomes containing mutations that
cause  tissue  overgrowth.  We  considered  positive  hits  those
mutations  whose  over-representation  in  a  mosaic  eye  was
enhanced when larvae were reared in the presence of ethanol.

Results and Discussion

Ethanol enhances tissue overgrowth associated with
loss of the Hippo tumor suppressor

regulators, 

In  an  ongoing  screen  to  elucidate  the  link  between  alcohol
and  cancer,  we  used  the  Gal4/UAS  system  [51]  and  the
FLP/FRT system of mosaic analysis [49] to modulate levels of
conserved  growth 
tumor  suppressors,  and
oncogenes  in  various  tissues  (eye,  wing,  etc.)  in  Drosophila
exposed to a range of dietary ethanol. Wings from control flies
(en>dcr2)  reared  on  food  containing  1-10%  ethanol  generally
showed  no  size  increase,  although  consistent  with  previous
reports  [21]  there  were  small  but  statistically  significant  size
decreases  in  some  cases  (Figure  1A-B).  Early  in  the  wing
screen, we identified the hpo tumor suppressor as a strong hit
(Figure 1C-G). RNAi to hpo in the posterior wing increased size
of  this  posterior  compartment  by  more  than  30%  (Figure  1C-
D,G).  Posterior  wing  overgrowth  was  statistically  significantly
further  increased  by  about  10%  in  flies  reared  on  food
containing 2-5% ethanol (Figure 1D-G) compared to hpo RNAi
alone.

To  establish  if  ethanol-mediated  enhancement  of  tissue
overgrowth  was  a  wing-specific  phenomenon  or  a  more
general  tissue  response,  we  examined  the  effects  of  dietary
ethanol  on  hpo  mutant  eye  tissue.  Mosaic  eyes  containing

that 

The  ability  of  alcohol  to  enhance  overgrowth  was  not
universal.  Over-expressing  the  oncogene  Myc  in  the  wing
(Figure 1Q) promotes wing overgrowth compared to a control
wing  (Figure  1P).  Dietary  ethanol  did  not  enhance  this
overgrowth (Figure 1R-S).

Alcohol enhances organ overgrowth associated with
expanded and warts but not Merlin or yorkie

To  establish  if  enhancement  of  wing  overgrowth  applied  to
other  components  of  the  Hippo  Pathway,  we  examined
knockdown  of  upstream  tumor  suppressor  components  Mer
and ex. Alcohol did not enhance overgrowth upon Mer RNAi in
the  posterior  wing  (Figure  2A),  but  statistically  significantly
enhanced  overgrowth  upon  ex  RNAi  (Figure  2B).  Our  data
could  reflect  interaction  with  alcohol  specific  for  Ex-directed
signaling  through  the  pathway  or  could  result  from  the
complicated  way  in  which  upstream  inputs  direct  pathway
outputs.  Signaling  through  the  pathway  is  complex  and  not
strictly linear; for example, Ex promotes signaling through Hpo
[48] and also binds and inhibits Yki directly [52]. Loss of Mer or
ex singly has distinct phenotypes from loss of core components
hpo  or  wts  [53].  However,  simultaneous  loss  of  Mer  and  ex
phenocopies  loss  of  hpo  or  wts  in  other  contexts  [48].  The
interaction  between  alcohol  and  ex  knockdown  but  not  Mer
knockdown can be further resolved as future work in the field
elucidates how upstream factors activate the pathway to define
distinct biological outputs.

To  address  downstream  components,  we  examined
knockdown  of  wts  and  over-expression  of  yki.  RNAi  to  wts  in
the posterior wing with engal4 led to such overgrowth that wing
folding  prevented  accurate  quantification.  We  therefore  used
weaker  pan-wing  driver  c765gal4.  Ethanol  enhanced  wing
overgrowth from RNAi to wts in females (Figure 2C).

Over-expressing yki in the posterior wing or across the whole
wing promotes tissue overgrowth. We tested conditions that led
to overgrowth similar to loss of hpo seen in Figure 1 for wild-
type  yki  transgene  UAS-ykiV5.  Surprisingly,  ethanol  did  not
reproducibly enhance ykiV5-mediated overgrowth (Figure 2D).
Therefore  we  tested  a  distinct  wild-type  yki  transgene,  UAS-
FLAGyki.  As  with  RNAi  to  wts,  overgrowth  produced  by  the
FLAGyki transgene using engal4 was too extensive to quantify,
so we assessed overgrowth with c765gal4. Consistent with our
findings  for  ykiV5,  dietary  ethanol  did  not  enhance  FLAGyki-
mediated overgrowth (Figure 2E). Because wild-type versions

Alcohol Interacts with the Hippo Pathway

If alcohol-mediated enhancement of overgrowth upon loss of
ex,  hpo,  or  wts  occurs  via  interaction  with  Yki  protein  or  its
targets,  we  would  predict  alcohol  to  enhance  Yki  over-
expression-induced  overgrowth.  Therefore,  our  genetic
interaction studies suggest that alcohol may interact with Hippo
signaling at or downstream of hpo and wts, possibly parallel to
yki. This is particularly unexpected because signaling through
Yki is reported to be crucial to overgrowth from loss of Hippo
Pathway tumor suppression. Our findings may reveal a role for
Yki-independent  Hippo  Pathway  targets  in  promoting  growth
upon alcohol exposure. Alternatively, alcohol may be acting in
a less straightforward way to regulate Yki protein not revealed
by our wild-type and mutant Yki over-expression studies.

Alcohol enhances Hpo over-expression phenotypes but
not Yki loss phenotypes

How  does  alcohol  enhance  overgrowth  due  to  loss  of  ex,
hpo, and wts? A trivial explanation would be that alcohol further
impairs signaling through the pathway. This explanation would
predict that alcohol should therefore suppress the phenotypes
of over-activating the pathway, such as by over-expressing hpo
itself.  In  contrast,  we  observed  that  dietary  ethanol  enhanced
hpo  over-expression  phenotypes.  Over-expressing  hpo  in  the
wing reduced wing size and disrupted wing patterning (Figure
3B,  quantified  in  3E,  3H-I)  compared  to  controls  (Figure  3A).
Flies reared in 5% ethanol-containing food showed a trend of
enhanced  wing  size  reduction  while  flies  reared  in  10%
ethanol-containing  food  showed  significantly  enhanced  wing
size reduction (Figure 3C-E). Because knockdown experiments
in Figure 1 do not eliminate all Hippo signaling, the increased
Hippo  pathway  activation  induced  in  the  presence  of  10%
ethanol  may  explain  the  perplexing  result  that  10%  ethanol
doses did not enhance wing overgrowth or as strongly enhance
eye  mutant  tissue  over-representation  upon  Hippo  loss  as
lower  doses  (Figure  1E-G,  K).  Exposure  to  5%  and  10%
ethanol significantly enhanced mis-patterning caused by Hippo
over-expression (Figure 3F-I).

How can we reconcile that alcohol (1) enhanced overgrowth
from  impaired  Hippo  Pathway  tumor  suppression  but  (2)  also
enhanced the phenotype of hpo over-expression? Although in
seeming conflict with our earlier results, the ability of ethanol to
enhance  hpo  over-expression  phenotypes  is  consistent  with
previous  reports  in  the  literature  using  in  vitro  systems.  Hpo
kinases Mst1 and Mst2 were identified in mammalian systems
as  stress  response  kinases  [55]  and  are  activated  in  cultured
cells  by  oxidative  stress  [56-58].  Alcohol  promotes  oxidative
stress; our findings may represent a validation of those in vitro
effects in a physiological setting.

Does 

this  enhancement  of  Hippo-induced  wing  size
reduction occur through further downregulation of yki? If so, we
would expect alcohol to also enhance the wing size reduction
of  knocking  down  (but  not  knocking  out)  yki  because
presumably the increased Hippo signaling would act to further
down-regulate  the  Yki  protein  produced.  Similar  to  hpo  over-
expression,  RNAi  to  yki  across  the  entire  wing  results  in  a
smaller wing (Figure 3K-M) compared to a control wing (Figure
3J). Parallel exposure of flies to doses of 10% ethanol (a dose
at which we saw effects on hpo over-expression phenotypes of

Alcohol Interacts with the Hippo Pathway

Figure 4.   Model for alcohol interaction with the Hippo Pathway.    As  established,  when  Hippo  signaling  is  intact  (A),  Yki  is
properly regulated and tissues maintain proper growth control. We propose that alcohol promotes activation of the pathway at or
upstream  of  Hippo  to  target  alcohol-relevant  growth-promoting  activities  (B)  to  maintain  proper  growth  control  upon  alcohol
exposure. When Hippo signaling is impaired (C), Yki becomes overactive and promotes tissue overgrowth. We propose that when
Hippo signaling is impaired in the presence of alcohol (D), Yki acts to promote overgrowth as established, and additional alcohol-
relevant targets of the pathway act to promote further overgrowth.

wing patterning and wing size) did not enhance the wing size
reduction due to RNAi of yki (Figure 3N-P). This may suggest
that 
further  enhances  Hpo-mediated  growth
regulation through targets other than yki.

A role for Hippo Pathway Tumor Suppression in
response to stress?

to  speculate 

it  seems  reasonable 

If Hippo signaling is activated by alcohol as part of a stress
response, 
that  Hippo
signaling is acting to prevent some of the deleterious effects of
alcohol. If this is the case, then impairing Hippo signaling in the
presence  of  alcohol  would  mean  those  deleterious  effects  of
alcohol would take place. Taking our findings into account with
this  logic,  we  propose  that  in  addition  to  tissue  homeostasis
regulated  by  Hippo  signaling  under  normal  conditions  (Figure
4A),  alcohol  does  not  promote  the  overgrowth  of  Drosophila
eye  and  wing  tissues  in  part  because  alcohol  promotes
activation of Hippo signaling (Figure 4B). However, in contexts
where  Hippo  signaling  is  impaired  and  tissue  undergoes
established Yki-dependent overgrowth (Figure 4C), we propose
alcohol  can 
tissue
overgrowth,  possibly  by 
interacting  with  Yki-independent
targets  of  Hippo  signaling  (Figure  4D)  because  yki  over-
expression is not sufficient to recapitulate this phenomenon.

to  promote  additional 

then  also  act 

alcohol.  We  speculate  that  activation  of  Hippo  signaling  by
alcohol  developed  in  a  common  ancestor  as  a  mechanism  to
maintain  proper  patterning  and  growth  regulation  even  upon
exposure  to  environmental  stressors;  maintenance  of  this
mechanism  may  have  been  selected  for  in  species  like
Drosophila that develop in the presence of alcohol, such as on
fermenting fruit or other species that encounter environmental
exposure  to  related  stressors,  to  prevent  stress-mediated
tissue overgrowth.

Our findings that alcohol enhances both Hippo Pathway loss
of function and over-expression phenotypes are consistent with
a role for dietary alcohol (i.e. whole animal exposure) to have
specific  effects  on  target  organs  undergoing  Hippo  Pathway
modulation.  This  could  be  particularly  relevant  in  prescribing
lifestyle  changes  and  for  designing  therapies  for  patients
depending on whether or not their tumors maintain intact Hippo
signaling. Moreover, our findings suggest that impaired Hippo
Pathway tumor suppression may underlie the pathogenesis of
specific  alcohol-mediated  cancers.  Notably,  there  is  striking
overlap  between  Hippo-associated  cancers 
[27-34]  and
alcohol-associated  cancers,  including  colorectal,  liver,  and
breast cancers [59-64].

Yki is the best-characterized target of the Hippo Pathway; its
homologs  YAP  and  TAZ  are  widely  accepted  to  play  an
important  role  in  cancer.  Therefore,  we  were  surprised  that
alcohol  did  not  enhance  tissue  overgrowth  upon  yki  over-
expression.  Alcohol  may  act  in  a  novel  way  to  promote  Yki
accumulation  or  activity.  Indeed,  alcohol  promoted  Hippo
signaling  which  normally  antagonizes  yki;  this  could  have

The ability of alcohol to promote Hippo signaling in flies and
for  oxidative  stress  to  promote  Hippo  signaling  in  mammalian
systems [55-58] suggests there may be a highly conserved role
for stress to activate the Hippo Pathway. This raises interesting
questions regarding the origins of Hippo signaling to respond to

masked  alcohol-mediated  enhancement  of  wild-type  yki
phenotypes  and  resulted  in  the  lack  of  observed  interaction
between  dietary  ethanol  and  wild-type  yki  over-expression
(Figure  2D).  However  (1),  we  did  not  observe  any  significant
phenotypic  enhancement  of  over-expressing  hpo  at  dietary
alcohol  concentrations  of  2%  (not  shown),  where  we  did  not
see interactions between yki over-expression and ethanol and
(2) alcohol did not enhance the organ size reduction caused by
knockdown of yki. Therefore, we believe the simplest model to
explain our data is that in the range of alcohol concentrations
tested  in  our  study,  alcohol  interacts  with  Yki-independent
targets  of  Hpo  and/or  Wts.  Our  report  may  represent  another
context  of  Hippo  Pathway  functions  that  are  Yki-independent
including  reported  roles  in  F-actin  regulation  [65]  and  polarity
[66].  Moreover,  controversial  reports  propose  YAP  acts  as  a
breast cancer tumor suppressor [67-69]. Thus, Hippo Pathway
targets parallel to YAP could be particularly relevant to alcohol-
mediated breast cancers.
