Individuals aected with neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1)
harbor
increased numbers of GFAP-immunoreactive
cerebral astrocytes and develop astrocytomas that can
lead to blindness and death. Mice heterozygous for a
targeted Nf1 mutation (Nf1+/7) were employed as a
model for the human disease to evaluate the hypothesis
that reduced NF1 protein (neuroﬁbromin) expression
may confer a growth advantage for astrocytes, such that
inactivation of only one NF1 allele is su(cid:129)cient
for
abnormal astrocyte proliferation. Here, we report that
Nf1+/7 mice have increased numbers of cerebral
astrocytes and increased astrocyte proliferation com-
pared to wild-type littermates. Intriguingly, primary
Nf1+/7 astrocyte cultures failed to demonstrate a
cell-autonomous growth advantage unless they were co-
cultured with C17 neuronal cells. This C17 neuronal cell-
induced Nf1+/7 increase in proliferation was blocked
by MEK inhibition (PD98059), suggesting a p21-ras-
dependent eect. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a
targeted mutation in another GAP molecule, p120-GAP,
demonstrated no increases in cerebral astrocyte number.
These ﬁndings suggest
that reduced NF1 expression
results in a cell context-dependent increase in astrocyte
proliferation that may be su(cid:129)cient for the development
of astrocytic growth abnormalities in patients with NF1.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis 1 is a common autosomal dominant
disorder in which aected individuals develop both
benign and malignant tumors at an increased frequency
(Bader, 1986; Riccardi, 1992). One of
the most
common tumors in NF1 is the glioma or astrocytoma
(Listernick et al., 1997; Gutmann et al., 1997).
Although these tumors typically occur in the optic
pathway and sometimes lead to visual compromise and
neurological dysfunction, they are also found in the
brainstem and other regions of the brain (Molloy et al.,
1995; Pollack et al., 1996). Advances in our under-
standing of the molecular pathogenesis of the clinical
features of NF1 have resulted from the identiﬁcation of
the NF1 gene and the elucidation of
its protein

function. The NF1 tumor
suppressor gene was
identiﬁed by positional cloning and found to encode
a 220 – 250 kiloDalton cytoplasmic protein termed
neuroﬁbromin (Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al.,
1990; Wallace et al., 1990). Neuroﬁbromin is expressed
in many cell
including neurons,
astrocytes, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, blood
vessels, adrenal medulla, gonadal tissues, and white
blood cells (DeClue et al., 1991; Gutmann et al., 1991,
1995; Daston et al., 1992; Golubic et al., 1992; Datson
and Ratner, 1993; Huynh et al., 1992). Sequence
analysis demonstrated that a small central domain of
neuroﬁbromin shares
catalytic
domain of proteins involved in p21-ras regulation
(Ballester et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Xu et al.,
1990a,b). These GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)
function to accelerate the inactivation of the p21-ras
protein from its active GTP-bound to its inactive
GDP-bound form (Bollag and McCormick, 1991).
Since p21-ras can transform ﬁbroblasts and increase
cell proliferation in vitro, neuroﬁbromin has been
hypothesized to negatively regulate cell growth by
inactivating p21-ras. In support of this mechanism,
several
neuroﬁbromin
suppresses cell growth by inhibiting p21-ras activity
in some cell types. These results are consistent with the
notion that the tumor suppressor function of neurofi-
bromin is related to its ability to operate as a GAP
molecule (Basu et al., 1992; DeClue et al., 1992; Bollag
et al., 1996; Largaespada et al., 1996). However, little is
known about
function of neuroﬁbromin in
astrocytes relevant to the development of astrocyto-
mas in individuals aected with NF1.

that

Previous work from our laboratory and others has
demonstrated that
increased p21-ras activity is a
common feature of sporadic malignant astrocytomas
(Gutmann et al., 1996; Guha et al., 1997). Inhibition of
p21-ras activity in astrocytoma tumor cells results in
reduced cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo
(Guha et al., 1997). The increase in p21-ras activation
in astrocytomas is the direct result of altered signaling
through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-
R), such that more p21-ras is converted from the
inactive GDP to the active GTP bound conformation.
In these sporadic astrocytomas, there is no loss of
neuroﬁbromin expression (Gutmann et al., 1996),
arguing that only one alteration in the p21-ras
signaling pathway (either EGFR activation or absent
neuroﬁbromin) is necessary for astrocytoma develop-
ment or progression. Since individuals aected with
NF1 develop astrocytomas and the NF1 gene product

hypothesis that reduced NF1 expression would be
su(cid:129)cient to confer a growth advantage on astrocytes.
In this report, we demonstrate that mice heterozygous
for a targeted Nf1 mutation have increased numbers of
cerebral astrocytes and increased astrocyte prolifera-
tion in vivo. We further show that this increase in
astrocyte proliferation is dependent on neuronal-like
cell contact in vitro. Lastly, mice heterozygous for a
targeted mutation in another GAP molecule, p120-
GAP, fail to demonstrate similar increases in cerebral
astrocytes. These results suggest that haploinsu(cid:129)ciency
for Nf1 expression confers a context-dependent growth
advantage for astrocytes that may account for the
astrocyte growth abnormalities seen in NF1.

Results

Astrocyte NF1 expression correlates with growth arrest
in vitro

Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated
that NF1 expression increases in astrocytes in response
to cerebral
ischemia, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines,
cAMP activation, and tumor formation (Hewett et
al., 1995; Giordano et al., 1996). These results suggest
that neuroﬁbromin might function during the astro-
gliotic response in the brain. In response to cerebral
ischemia, the time course of increased neuroﬁbromin
expression occurred after 4 – 7 days, consistent with
periods of astrocyte growth arrest and not proliferation
(Janeczko, 1988). To determine whether NF1 expres-
sion was associated with growth arrest in vitro, primary
astrocyte cultures were established from 129sv wild
type mice and maintained as a function of days in vitro.
Parallel
cultures were analysed for NF1 mRNA
expression (RT – PCR analysis; Figure 1a), neurofibro-
min expression (Western blot analysis; Figure 1b), and
FACS analysis (Figure 1a). The doubling time of
primary astrocyte cultures was approximately 4 days as
determined by BrdU pulse-chase FACS analysis (data
not shown). We have previously shown that primary
astrocytes reach conﬂuence by 12 – 14 days in vitro and
undergo growth arrest presumably due to contact
inhibition. FACS analysis of parallel cultures demon-
strated that 70 – 80% of the astrocytes were in G0/G1
prior to day 14 in vitro compared to 94 – 95% of the
astrocytes in G0/G1 after that time. NF1 RNA and
protein expression increased dramatically by 10 days in
vitro when 80% of the astrocytes are in G0/G1, just
prior to the onset of astrocyte growth arrest. These
ﬁndings argue that the increase in NF1 expression is
associated with the onset of growth arrest in astrocytes
and is consistent with the notion that neuroﬁbromin
may function as a growth regulator for astrocytes.

(Rizvi et al., 1999). Alternatively,
reduced Nf1 expression does not
confer a cell
autonomous growth advantage, but rather an abnor-
mal response to other stimuli. We therefore tested the
hypothesis that the increase in astrocyte number in
Nf1+/7 brains reﬂected an increase in cell prolifera-
tion. First, litters of Nf1 pups (5 – 8 weeks of age) were
injected with 5 mg/g BrdU 48 h prior to perfusion and
double-label
immunohistochemistry with GFAP and
BrdU antibodies. The percentage of astrocytes (GFAP-
immunoreactive cells) with nuclear BrdU immuno-
reactivity in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus CA1
region was determined. We detected an increase in the
in Nf1+/7
percentage of proliferating astrocytes
compared to wild type Nf1+/+ mice (Figure 5a). On
average, approximately twofold increased astrocyte
proliferation was observed in the Nf1+/7 brains.

We reasoned that this increase in astrocyte prolifera-
tion might reﬂect an abnormal response on the part of
the Nf1+/7 astrocytes to neuronal contact or stimuli.

To develop an in vitro correlate for this neuronal
context-dependent eect on astrocyte proliferation, we
established primary astrocyte cultures from wild type
and Nf1+/7 littermates grown in the presence or
absence of lightly ﬁxed and extensively washed C17
neuronal cells. This cell
line was chosen based on
previous experiments demonstrating that they display
some properties of neurons and can interact with
astrocytes (Ryder et al., 1990; Weinstein et al., 1990).
No thymidine incorporation was detected with the ﬁxed
C17 cells alone in the absence of astrocytes (not shown).
Astrocytes from Nf1+/7, but not wild type Nf1+/+,
mice demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
thymidine incorporation in response to C17 cell co-
culture (Figure 5b). This increase in proliferation ranged
between 1.7- and 1.8-fold.

We next determined whether this increase in astrocyte
proliferation in response to neuronal-like cell contact
resulted in changes in p21-ras pathway activation.
Initial experiments failed to demonstrate reproducible
changes in MEK activity between Nf1+/7 astrocyte
cultures cultured in the presence or absence of C17
neuronal-like cells (data not shown). Similarly, no
signiﬁcant changes in p38-MAPK or Akt activation
were observed (data not shown). Although no changes
in p21-ras pathway activity were detected, we reasoned
that reduced Nf1 expression in the context of C17 co-

culture could result in increased cell proliferation in a
p21-ras-dependent fashion, but these changes fell below
the threshold of detectability in our assays. To
determine whether this context-dependent increase in
Nf1+/7 astrocyte proliferation could be abrogated by
p21-ras pathway inhibition, cultures were treated with
50 mM PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). As shown in Figure
5c, PD98059 treatment of Nf1+/7 astrocytes (cultures
#2 and #4) co-cultured with C17 cells reduced the
proliferation to levels observed in the astrocytes
cultured without C17 cells. In contrast, no eect of
PD98059 treatment on proliferation was observed on
the wild type astrocytes (cultures #1 and #3). These
results suggest that the context-dependent increase in
astrocyte proliferation is dependent on p21-ras activa-
tion.

It is unlikely that the increase in GFAP expression
detected in Nf1+/7 mouse brains reﬂected astro-
gliosis. Although increased GFAP expression was
detected in the Nf1+/7 brains compared with the
wild type littermate brains (Figure 2b), no increase in
GFAP expression was detected in cultured Nf1+/7
astrocytes compared to wild type astrocytes in vitro
(Figure 4a). Furthermore, no signiﬁcant changes in
GFAP expression were noted in Nf1+/7 astrocytes
when co-cultured with C17 cells either (Figure 6).

We quantitated the number of GFAP-immunoreactive

These ﬁndings suggest
that a general reduction in

Discussion

Since individuals aected with NF1 commonly develop

for astrocytes. Neuroﬁbromin is expressed at low levels
in resting mature astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo

Increased cerebral astrocytes in Nf1+/7mice
DH Gutmann et al

(Nordlund et al., 1993; Hewett et al., 1995). During
astrocyte activation in vitro, in response to elevations in
cAMP levels or
in response to pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines, there is a dramatic upregulation of NF1
mRNA and protein expression (Hewett et al., 1995).
Similarly in vivo, increased NF1 expression is observed
in activated astrocytes in response to cerebral ischemia
(Giordano et al., 1996) or tumor xenograft implanta-
tion (Gutmann, unpublished observations). The time
course of increased neuroﬁbromin expression correlates
with periods of astrocyte growth arrest and not
proliferation,
suggesting that upregulation of NF1
expression is associated with negative growth regula-
tion. In this study, we demonstrate that
increased
neuroﬁbromin expression precedes astrocyte growth
arrest in vitro. These results provide indirect evidence
that neuroﬁbromin functions as a negative growth
regulator for astrocytes.

To provide more direct proof

that Nf1+/7 mice demonstrate

for a growth
regulatory function of neuroﬁbromin in astrocytes, we
employed an animal model
in which mice were
heterozygous for a targeted mutation in the Nf1 gene.
These mice are genetically similar
to individuals
aected with NF1 in that they harbor one wild type
and one mutant NF1 allele in every cell of the body.
Previous autopsy studies on NF1 patient brains
demonstrated increased GFAP-immunoreactive astro-
cytes (Nordlund et al., 1995). In this report, we
demonstrate
in-
creased numbers of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes
in the brain, similar to that described for individuals
aected with NF1. Recently, Ratner and colleagues
have reported similar increases in GFAP-immuno-
reactivity in brains from mice heterozygous for a
targeted Nf1 mutation, conﬁrming the observations
reported herein (Rizvi et al., 1999). We further
demonstrate that this increase in GFAP-immunoreac-
tive astrocytes reﬂects increased astrocyte proliferation
both in vitro and in vivo. We show that the increase in
Nf1+/7 astrocyte proliferation is not a cell-autono-
mous property of these astrocytes but rather appears to
be a cell context- and p21-ras-dependent event that
requires neuronal-like cell contact. Lastly, we demon-
strate that Gap+/7 mice fail
to demonstrate any
changes in astrocyte proliferation. These results argue
that this astrocyte proliferative eect is neuroﬁbromin-
speciﬁc and is not reﬂective of a general rasGAP eect
on astrocytes.

Previous

studies on the eects of neurons on
astrocyte proliferation have demonstrated that neu-
rons and neuronal membranes can exert an inhibitory
eect on astrocyte proliferation (Sobue and Pleasure,
1984; Eccleston et al., 1989). In these reports, rat
central nervous system axolemmal fragments induced
phenotypic alterations in cultured astrocytes concomi-
tant with greater than a 50% reduction in tritiated
thymidine
co-culture of
guinea-pig enteric neurons with rat Schwann cells or
astrocytes reduced Schwann cell and astrocyte pro-
liferation in vitro. In contrast, guinea-pig dorsal root
ganglia neurons or bovine
fractions
stimulated astrocyte tritiated thymidine incorporation,
similar to what has been reported for Schwann cells
(Eccleston et al., 1989). The C17 retrovirally immorta-
lized neuronal-like cell line has been shown to inhibit
astrocyte and astrocytoma proliferation in a dose-

incorporation. Similarly,

dependent manner (Weinstein et al., 1990). However,
using primary astrocytes, the ratio of ﬁxed C17 cells to
astrocytes was critical: Only 17.4% inhibition was
observed at a 1 : 1 ratio whereas 94% inhibition was
observed when the C17 : astrocyte cell ratio was 10 : 1.
In our experiments, we determined that the maximal
C17 cell proliferative eect on the Nf1+/7 astrocytes
was observed at a 1 : 1 ratio with no growth-
stimulatory eect observed at a 10 : 1 ratio. Further-
more, the lightly ﬁxed C17 cells were loosely adherent
to the astrocytes and,
in this fashion, may have
behaved more like axonal membranes
than living

however, to account for the observation that astrocyte-

Greenwood et al., 1997). Similarly, NF1 haploinsuffi-

Habiby et al., 1995). The majority of
pathway gliomas are clinically asymptomatic and do
not enlarge to result in visual impairment or blindness.
In this fashion, these tumors behave as benign growths.
In contrast, some of the NF1-associated astrocytomas
grow rapidly and lead to blindness or neurologic
compromise as a result of tumor extension. The fact
that gliomas do not form as a consequence of Nf1
haploinsu(cid:129)ciency suggests
that additional genetic
changes are required.

these tumors

One of these additional genetic events might involve
loss of the one remaining wild type Nf1 allele, resulting
in a complete absence of neuroﬁbromin expression in
selected astrocytes in the brain. In agreement with the
Knudson two hit hypothesis, loss of both functional
Nf1 alleles might be associated with tumor formation.
We would hypothesize that
lacking
neuroﬁbromin expression represent the ‘benign’ clini-
cally non-progressive tumors seen in as many as 10%
of patients with NF1. To develop a clinically aggressive
optic pathway glioma in NF1, mutations in other
tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53) might be required to
facilitate malignant transformation. In support of this
notion, cooperation between p53 inactivation and
increased ras activity has been reported for Schwann
cells, such that both events are required to confer
increased Schwann cell proliferation (Ridley et al.,
1989).

Substantial experimental data exist for a rasGAP
growth suppressor function of neuroﬁbromin in some
cell types. However,
it is not clear whether neurofi-
bromin functions as a negative growth regulator for
astrocytes by modulating p21-ras pathway activation.

In this report, we demonstrate that the increase in
primary Nf1+/7 astrocyte proliferation in response to
ﬁxed C17 cells is inhibited by blocking MEK activity.
These results argue that the increase in proliferation is
the result of increased p21-ras pathway activation as a
consequence of decreased neuroﬁbromin GAP func-
tion. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to more
completely characterize this neuroﬁbromin eect on
p21-ras pathway activity in astrocytes.

The development of sporadic astrocytomas involves
a multi-step process of genetic and biochemical
alterations. One of
the most common alterations
observed in high grade gliomas is increased activation
of p21-ras (Gutmann et al., 1996; Guha et al., 1997). In
the case of sporadic astrocytomas, this increase in p21-
ras activity results from abnormal activation of the
positive regulators of p21-ras, as a consequence of
augmented EGF-R signaling (Guha et al., 1997).
Activation of the EGF-R results in recruitment of the
shc adaptor protein and the hSOS guanosine nucleo-
tide replacing factor (GNRF), culminating in activa-
tion of p21-ras by the exchange of GDP for GTP.
Inhibition of EGF-R signaling or p21-ras activation in
glioma cells results in decreased cell proliferation both
in vitro and in vivo. In a similar fashion, it is possible
that
loss of neuroﬁbromin expression in NF1
astrocytomas could also result in increased p21-ras
activation through absent neuroﬁbromin GAP func-
tion. In either case,
increased GNRF or decreased
neuroﬁbromin GAP activity might provide p21-ras-
dependent mitogenic signals for astrocytes relevant to
the development of an astrocytoma.

Primary astrocyte cultures
Nf1+/7 mice were generously provided by Dr Neal
Copeland (National Cancer
(Brannan et al.,
1994). Gap+/7 mice have been previously described
(Henkemeyer
1995). Both are maintained as
continuous colonies at Washington University. Heterozy-
gotes and wild type mice were genotyped from tail DNA
obtained at the time of weaning using published primer sets.
Primary astrocyte cultures (497% pure astrocytes) were
established from postnatal day 1 – 3 newborn pups as
previously described (Hewett et al., 1993; Rose et al., 1993).
Astrocyte purity was assessed using cell
type-speciﬁc
antibodies (GFAP for astrocytes, MAP2 for neurons, and
GalC for oligodendrocytes). Brieﬂy, cerebral cortices were
dissected and enzymatically digested in 0.09% trypsin for

20 – 30 min. Cultures were maintained in modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM glucose,
10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 1% pen-strep and
10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. Thymidine incorporation
was performed by pulsing astrocytes with 1 mCi tritiated
thymidine (Amersham) per ml for 24 h in 24 well plates (six
wells per culture or condition). Labeled cells were washed in
PBS and solubilized in 200 ml of 0.2 M NaOH. Counts were
then determined in a scintillation counter. The percentage of
astrocytes in G0/G1 was determined by FACS analysis on a
Becton Dickinson FACScan as previously described (Norton
et al., 1995).

RNA and protein analysis

Western blotting was performed using WA15a
(pan
neuroﬁbromin; Gutmann et al., 1996), tubulin (clone DM1-
A; Sigma), GFAP (Zymed), and activation-speciﬁc phospho-
MAPK and p38-MAPK (Promega) antibodies with HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and ECL develop-
ment (Amersham). Primary antibodies were used according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations while WA15a was
used at a 1 : 300 dilution (Basu et al., 1992; Norton et al.,
1995a,b). For experiments involving MAPK determinations,
cultures were serum starved overnight prior to stimulation
with serum containing 100 ng/ml EGF for 60 min and
collected by direct harvest in MAPK lysis buer (20 mM
Tris, pH 7.5; 10 mM EGTA, 40 mM beta-glycerophosphate;
1% NP40; 2.5 mM MgCl2; 2 mM orthovanadate) on ice. In
vitro MAPK assays were performed according to published
protocols using a rabbit polyclonal ERK2 antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 1 mCi
[a-32P]ATP (Amersham) in the presence of DTT.

Forebrain tissue was carefully dissected from freshly
euthanized mice of at
least 3 months of age and
homogenized in RIPA buer containing protease inhibitors
prior to separation by SDS – PAGE. RNA was extracted for
semi-quantitative RT – PCR analysis using a previously
reported NF1 primer set that ampliﬁes sequences within the
GAP-related domain and a cyclophilin primer set to control
for RNA quality and quantity (5’-ATGGTCAACCC-
CACCGTGTT-3’ and 5’-CGTTGTAAGTCACCACCCT-3’)
(Gutmann et al., 1995). RT – PCR products were resolved by
non-denaturing PAGE.

C17 neuronal cell co-culture

C17 neuronal cells (generously provided by Dr C Cepko;
Harvard Medical School) were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Ryder et al., 1990). Prior to
co-culture with primary astrocytes, C17 cells were lightly
ﬁxed in 0.1% paraformaldehyde and washed extensively in
media (10 000 cells each per well; 6 wells/condition). In these
experiments, 10 000 ﬁxed C17 cells were co-cultured with 10
000 primary astrocytes for 72 h prior to the addition of
1 mCi/well of tritiated thymidine for an additional 24 h. Ten
thousand primary astrocytes were cultured in parallel wells in
the absence of C17 cells. No thymidine incorporation was
observed in the ﬁxed C17 cells when cultured independently
in separate wells (data not shown). In the MEK inhibition
experiment, PD98059 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of
50 mM in each well
for the 24 h in which the tritiated
thymidine was included. For each experiment, the mean and
standard deviation of
the six wells per condition were
determined.

Cell counting

antibodies as previously described (Norton et al., 1995a,b;
Geist et al., 1996). Development was accomplished using
biotinylated secondary antibodies and ABC Elite (Vector)
reagents with DAB or Vector-SG. Landmarks for astrocyte
counting were established using a standard mouse brain atlas
(Paxinos and Watson, 1986). Only cells containing clearly
deﬁned nuclei within the focal plane of the section were
counted in at least six consecutive serial sections from at least
six mice matched for sex or genotype. BrdU incorporation
was performed by a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg
BrdU (Sigma) per g body weight of mice at least 2 months of
age (20 – 30 gms) 2 days prior to euthanasia and analysed by
double labeling immunohistochemistry with BrdU (Sigma)
and GFAP antibodies. BrdU was detected using mouse
