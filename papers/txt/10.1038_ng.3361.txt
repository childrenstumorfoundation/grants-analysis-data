We	report	on	whole-exome	sequencing	(WES)	of	213	melanomas.	Our	analysis	established	NF1,	encoding	a	negative	regulator	of	
RAS,	as	the	third	most	frequently	mutated	gene	in	melanoma,	after	BRAF	and	NRAS.	Inactivating	NF1	mutations	were	present	in	
46%	of	melanomas	expressing	wild-type	BRAF	and	RAS,	occurred	in	older	patients	and	showed	a	distinct	pattern	of	co-mutation	
with	other	RASopathy	genes,	particularly	RASA2.	Functional	studies	showed	that	NF1	suppression	led	to	increased	RAS	activation	
in	most,	but	not	all,	melanoma	cases.	In	addition,	loss	of	NF1	did	not	predict	sensitivity	to	MEK	or	ERK	inhibitors.	The	rebound	
pathway,	as	seen	by	the	induction	of	phosphorylated	MEK,	occurred	in	cells	both	sensitive	and	resistant	to	the	studied	drugs.	We	
conclude	that	NF1	is	a	key	tumor	suppressor	lost	in	melanomas,	and	that	concurrent	RASopathy	gene	mutations	may	enhance	its	
role	in	melanomagenesis.

Recent years have seen unprecedented growth in the understanding 
of genetic and genomic changes in melanoma. Much of the informa-
tion is from next-generation sequencing (NGS), particularly exome 
sequencing, and has been instrumental in the discovery of new cancer- 
driver genes. These NGS studies have corroborated the previously 
identified frequent recurrent somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS 
and revealed new melanoma mutations, including a recurrent muta-
tion in RAC1 (RAC1P29S), the third most frequent activating mutation  
in sun-exposed melanoma after BRAF and NRAS, and the most fre-
quent recurring mutation in the Rho GTPase family1–3. The mutant 
protein RAC1P29S is a fast-cycling GTPase favoring the GTP-bound 
state that accelerates cell proliferation and migration when expressed in 
normal melanocytes. Screens uncovered other mutations at recurrent 
positions in PPP6C that reduce the phosphatase’s catalytic activity, con-
sequently dysregulating the kinase AURKA and causing chromosome 
instability4,5. Frequent inactivating mutations were also discovered in 
the tumor suppressors TP53, NF1 and ARID2, and less frequent muta-
tions were found in TACC1, GRM3, MAP3K4 and MAP3K9 that are 
likely to enhance melanoma pathogenesis6,7. Furthermore, recent stud-
ies have shed light on variants in regulatory regions of the melanoma 
genome. Recurrent mutations in the TERT promoter, which alter a 
transcription factor–binding motif and possibly lead to increased 
expression  of  TERT,  shield  melanoma  cells  from  senescence8,9.  

NGS has also fostered an increased understanding of the genetics of 
noncutaneous melanomas, with the discovery of frequent mutations 
in BAP1, EIF1AX and SF3B1 in uveal melanoma10,11.

We report here the results of WES analysis of 213 human melanoma 
samples, including samples from 109 patients that we studied previ-
ously3 (Supplementary Data). Matched normal DNA was sequenced 
and analyzed from 133 of the tumors. We also tested the response of 
melanoma cell lines to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244), 
currently in clinical trials, and to the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 and 
performed protein blot analyses to correlate the effects of specific 
mutations with drug response.

RESULTS
Identification	of	NF1-mutant	melanoma	subgroup
Nevi can harbor activating BRAF or NRAS mutations but remain in 
a growth-arrested state. In some melanomas, somatic mutations in 
PTEN, CDKN2A or PPP6C are likely to account for initiation of the 
proliferative state. To comprehensively understand the mutations that 
lead to malignant transformation, we analyzed genes for evidence of 
selection and significantly increased mutation burden. We applied 
the ‘20/20 rule’ to identify genes with nonsilent mutations at recur-
rent positions that constituted 20% or more of all observed mutations 
or genes with at least 20% inactivating mutations, that is, nonsense,

The list shows the top 40 expressed genes with high mutation burdens according to 
the 20/20 rule12. The rule identifies genes with mutations at recurrent positions that 
constitute 20% or more of all observed mutations as likely oncogenes (three leftmost 
columns) and genes with at least 20% inactivating mutations (i.e., premature termina-
tion, splice-site variant or indel) as likely tumor suppressors (three rightmost columns). 
Also shown is the number of samples with qualifying mutations in these genes.

splice-site variant or insertion-deletion (indel) mutations12. The top 
40 ranked genes from this analysis are shown in Table 1 (details are 
also provided in the Supplementary Data). Among those, we identi-
fied 11 genes that exhibited statistically significant mutation counts 
above what was expected on the basis of a driver gene analysis by 
MutSigCV13 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data).

Three genes were mutated with an incidence greater than 10%: 
BRAF and NRAS, with known recurrent activating mutations, and 
NF1, with a high number of inactivating mutations. In our cohort, 
we observed BRAFV600 mutations in 38.5% of melanomas (82 of 213)  
and  RASQ61/G12/G13  mutations  (58  NRAS  and  3  HRAS)  in  28.6% 
(61 of 213), and two melanomas were BRAF-NRAS double mutants

(Table 2). Ninety percent of the NF1-mutant melanomas (38 of 42) 
harbored mutations of the inactivating or predicted damaging type 
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data), with the majority 
(26 of 38) in melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF-RAS, as noted 
previously by our group3 and recently by The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) consortium14; two NRASQ61R-mutant, one KRASG12I-mutant 
and nine BRAFV600-mutant melanomas had concurrent NF1 muta-
tions. Among the tumors with no detectable BRAF or RAS mutation, 
a total of 46.4% (26 of 56) were NF1 mutants (Table 2). Of those, more 
than 80% (21 of 26) either showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across 
the NF1 locus or were compound heterozygotes harboring two NF1 
mutations. Conversely, of the 12 BRAF-mutant or RAS-NF1 double-
mutant melanomas, one-third (4 of 12) showed LOH or compound 
heterozygosity (Supplementary Data).

NF1-mutant  melanomas  harbored  significantly  more  somatic  
mutations  (P  =  1.5  ×  10−10)  and  occurred  in  significantly  older 
patients  (P  =  0.017),  but  they  were  associated  with  similar  over-
all  patient  survival  compared  to  BRAF-mutant,  RAS-mutant  and  
‘triple–wild-type’ (BRAF-RAS-NF1–wild-type) melanomas (Fig. 1 
and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Mutations in known melanoma-driver genes affecting cell prolifera-
tion and survival, including RAC1, PTEN, CDKN2A, MAP2K1 and 
RB1, were also detected. This list included the X-chromosome gene 
FAM58A, which harbored several inactivating mutations. FAM58A 
(also known as cyclin M) negatively regulates RAF1 expression via 
interaction with CDK10, and mutations in FAM58A cause the inherited 
human developmental disease STAR syndrome15. Early-termination 
alterations in FAM58A were present in four tumors from male patients. 
All of the tumors were BRAF-RAS wild type; two were NF1-mutant and 
the other two were triple–wild type. The analysis also showed a recur-
rent R18W mutation in BCL2L12, which encodes an anti-apoptotic  
factor16. This mutation was adjacent to F17F, a recurrent silent muta-
tion with increased inhibitory potential against UV-induced apoptosis 
due to increased BCL2L12 gene transcript and protein levels17.

Mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification or DNA 
repair were identified, some for the first time in melanoma. The list 
included two SWI/SNF family members, ARID1A (linked to gastric 
cancers18) and ARID2, reiterating the role of chromatin remodeling 
in malignancy. An additional gene in this category was the polycomb 
protein–encoding gene EZH2, which is upregulated in melanoma19; 
we noted recurrent EZH2Y646N mutations in four tumors. The muta-
tion was located in the SET domain, which is 
involved in histone methylation20. A consider-
able number of inactivating mutations were in 
histone modifiers. Mutations were identified  
in KMT2B (MLL2) and SETD2, the latter of

which is a recognized tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma21, as 
well as in TRRAP, involved in histone acetylation, which showed a 
previously described recurrent TRRAPS722F mutation22.

Finally,  in  the  metabolism  category,  we  found  22  mutations  in 
CYP7B1, some of which occurred at recurrent positions (H286Y, 
E321K and P338S), suggesting an important role for cytochrome P450 
in melanoma. Diminished expression of CYP7B1 is associated with 
breast cancer, possibly through modification of cholesterol metabo-
lism23. We also observed a recurrent IDH1R132C mutation in four 
tumors. IDH1R132C, frequently present in glioma24 is a neomorphic 
mutation that causes production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate rather than 
the normal product, α-keto glutarate25.

NF1-mutant	melanomas	harbor	co-mutations	in	RASopathy	genes
A search for subtype-specific variants showed that damaging mutations 
in RASA2, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein that suppresses 
RAS function26, were exclusively present in NF1-mutant melanomas 
that were BRAF-RAS wild type (P = 0.006; Supplementary Data). 
Of the nine RASA2 mutations, two were nonsense and three were 
recurrent at position R551C. Four of the seven RASA2-mutant tumors 
showed LOH across the locus (all with a single RASA2 mutation),  
and two were compound heterozygotes. The recurrent RASA2R511C 
variant  was  recently  described  in  the  germline  of  a  patient  with 
Noonan syndrome27, a RASopathy otherwise linked to mutations 
in  SOS1,  PTPN11,  RAF1  and  other  genes  affecting  RAS-MAPK  
signaling28.  A  search  across  these  genes  showed  that  four  NF1-
mutant, BRAF-RAS–wild-type melanomas harbored disease-causing  
mutations in PTPN11, with p.Tyr279Cys, p.Ala461Thr, p.Pro491Leu 
and  p.Glu506Pro  linked  to  the  Noonan  and  LEOPARD  syn-
dromes29,30.  Two  NF1-mutant,  BRAF-RAS–wild-type  melanomas  
harbored  mutations  in  SOS1 
linked  to  Noonan  syndrome 
(p.Gly434Arg and p.Arg552Lys)31–33, and another two had mutations 
in RAF1 (p.Pro261Leu and p.Thr491Ile) that were also associated with 
Noonan syndrome34. NF1-mutant melanomas also featured mutations 
in SPRY and Sprouty-related genes known to encode negative regula-
tors of MAPK signaling. In particular, three NF1-mutant melanomas 
harbored  protein-coding  alterations  in  SPRED1,  including  early- 
termination mutations. SPRED1 enhances NF1 activity by recruit-
ing the protein to the plasma membrane35, and early-termination  
mutations  in  SPRED1  are  linked  to  Legius  syndrome  (another 
RASopathy),  which 
is  characterized  by  neurofibromatosis- 
like  skin  features  such  as  multiple  café-au-lait  macules,  but  
not neurofibromas36.

In all, out of 26 NF1-mutant, BRAF-RAS–wild-type melanomas, 
~60% (15) carried mutations in known RASopathy genes RASA2, 
PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1 and SPRED1, the majority of which (10 of 
15)  were  documented  disease-causing  mutations  (Table  3  and 
Supplementary Data).

Although  the  occurrence  of  RASopathy  gene  mutations  was 
significantly  associated  with  NF1-mutant,  BRAF-RAS–wild-type 
melanomas (P = 0.0004; Supplementary Data), 8.6% (16 of 187) 
of the remaining melanomas in our cohort also featured mutations 
in these genes (Supplementary Fig. 3). Mutations in three of these 
genes were thought to be disease causing: (1) two early-termination 
mutations in SPRED1 (in two different tumors, one with BRAFV600E 
and another with NRASQ61L mutation); (2) p.Asn58Ser in PTPN11, 
a known gain-of-function mutation in lung cancer37 that occurred  
in a melanoma with NRASQ61R; and (3) a p.Met269Lys SOS1 mutation  
in  a  triple–wild-type  melanoma.  The  mutated  residue  in  SOS1 
(p.Met269) has documented associations with Noonan syndrome38.
Of  interest,  the  pathogenic  PTPN11P491L  and  MAPK1D321V, 
the  latter  a  mutation  in  the  docking  site  for  DUSP-ERK  interac-
tion, were present in YUKLAB  NF1H729Q/R1204W/R416* melanoma.  
The protein encoded by MAPK1D321V is similar to the known D321N, 
which  impairs  binding  to  DUSPs  and  reduces  the  sensitivity  to  
inactivation by phosphatases39. Finally, two NF1-mutant melanomas 
(YUROG NF1Q1218* and YUCAS NF1FS-Indel) contained KRASA146T 
and  KRASQ22K,  respectively,  known  activating  mutations  in  
colorectal cancer40.

NF1	mutations,	NF1	expression	and	RAS	activation

converting  active  RAS-GTP  to  inactive  RAS-GDP.  We  therefore

investigated  NF1  expression  and  NRAS  activity  in  our  exome-
sequenced melanoma cell lines. Protein blot analysis showed that 
75% of NF1-mutant melanomas (six out of ten), all BRAF-NRAS wild 
type, did not express NF1 or expressed it at low levels (Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Fig. 4). One melanoma, YUDAB, homozygous for 
NF1F1464L mutation, did not express the protein, perhaps because of 
protein instability. Interestingly, the two NF1-mutant melanomas that 
expressed NF1 were also BRAFV600E mutants. One of them was from a 
neurofibromatosis patient with a germline NF1 frameshift mutation. 
This sample showed levels of NF1 expression about half those found 
in normal human melanocytes (YUSAMIR; Fig. 2a). Figure 2 also 
shows that two NF1–wild-type melanomas (YUHOIN and YUDATE) 
did not express NF1, and both showed LOH across the NF1 locus.

RAF pulldown assay showed that loss or low levels of NF1 were 
associated with the presence of activated GTP-bound RAS in most 
but not all cases (Fig. 2b,c), demonstrating the likely involvement of 
other RAS regulators.

NF1	expression	and	drug	response
One of the main goals of identifying driver mutations in cancer is 
to make it easier to choose an appropriate targeted therapy, such 
as  vemurafenib  or  dabrafenib,  drugs  that  inhibit  mutant  BRAF

melanomas,  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  BRAFV600-mutant 
tumors41,42. Loss of NF1 expression was suggested to mediate resist-
ance to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) in one report43 
and  to  be  a  biomarker  for  high  sensitivity  to  the  MEK  inhibitor 
PD0325901 in another44. A more recent study showed that NF1- 
negative  and  NF1-positive  melanoma  cell  lines  display  the  same  
sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib45. We therefore tested  
the effect of selumetinib, which is currently in clinical trials, on a 
panel of 21 melanoma cell lines, 10 NF1 mutants (or null by LOH) 
and 11 NF1 wild type, all characterized by exome sequencing (Fig. 3).  
The data showed that 60% of the NF1-mutant melanoma cell lines  
(six out of ten) were highly sensitive (IC50 of 0.036 µM or below), 
and four were highly resistant (IC50 of 2.1–10 µM) (Fig. 3a), indi-
cating that suppression of NF1 is not always  
associated  with  sensitivity  or  resistance 
to a MEK inhibitor as was previously sug-
gested43,44.  Seven  of  the  ten  NF1-mutant, 
BRAF-NRAS–wild-type  melanoma  cell 
lines  did  not  express  NF1  or  expressed  it 
at extremely low levels (Fig. 2a). Of those, 
~43% (three out of seven) were sensitive to  
MEK inhibition.

All three double-mutant melanoma cell lines in this panel were 
sensitive to selumetinib. These included YURKEN, which carries 
NF1P228S-BRAFV600E  mutation  (IC50  =  0.028);  YUTICA,  which 
harbors  NF1P166L-NRASQ61R  mutation;  and  YUSAMIR,  an  NF1FS 
indel–BRAFV600E  mutant  from  a  person  with  neurofibromatosis  
(Fig.  3a).  All  three  expressed  high  levels  of  NF1  (Fig.  2a).  Also, 
YURKEN was highly resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, 
whereas YUSAMIR was highly sensitive to the drug (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). The results suggest that patients with double mutations should 
not be a priori excluded from vemurafenib treatment on the basis of 
expected resistance to the drug43,44.

Melanoma cell lines that did not carry an NF1 mutation showed 
diverse sensitivity to selumetinib, with an IC50 range of 0.003–0.374 µM,  
and ~55% (6 of 11) showed only a cytostatic response (Fig. 3b).

We  also  tested  the  response  to  SCH772984,  a  selective  ATP-
competitive ERK inhibitor that is in phase I clinical trials. Again, 
the  highly  selumetinib-resistant  NF1-null  YUHOIN  and  YUHEF 
melanoma cells were also the most resistant to this ERK inhibitor 
(Fig.  3c).  However,  in  general,  drug  response  followed  a  similar  
distribution  in  the  NF1-null,  triple–wild-type  and  BRAF-NRAS 
mutant melanoma cell lines (Fig. 3c,d).

We explored the possibility that selumetinib induces upstream-
pathway activation that is more prominent in NF1-null resistant cells 
than in sensitive cell lines, as this was suggested to characterize MEK 
resistance44. Protein blot analyses showed increased levels of phos-
phorylated MEK (pMEK) in all melanoma cells that did not carry 
the BRAFV600E/K mutation (i.e., NF1-null, NRASQ61R/L-mutant and 
even normal human melanocytes), regardless of the cells’ sensitivity 
to selumetinib in cell proliferation assays (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, 
although  pERK  was  suppressed  within  an  hour  in  response  to 
selumetinib in all cell lines, its rebound at later time points was not 
indicative of resistance to the drug. For example, pERK did not recover 
in the resistant YUHEF cell line at the end of 24 h of treatment with 
100 nM selumetinib, whereas it did recover in the resistant YUSOC 
and  YUHOIN  lines,  as  well  as  in  the  sensitive  cell  line  YUDAB  
(Fig. 4a). Taken together, the data show that the feedback that leads 
to ERK activation in response to selumetinib in NF1-null melanoma 
cells is not necessarily associated with resistance to the drug, and that 
pERK phosphorylation is not required for selumetinib resistance.

Somatic	copy-number	alterations	in	triple–wild-type	melanomas
We  derived  the  genomic  copy-number  status  and  somatic  copy-
number  alterations  (SCNAs)  on  the  basis  of  differences  in  read 
coverage  between  normal  and  matched  tumor  samples.  Recent  
bioinformatics  approaches  allow  for  the  long-range  prediction  of 
SCNAs by means of exome sequencing46. The corresponding SCNA 
segments can then be analyzed for broad and focal amplified and 
deleted regions with downstream programs such as GISTIC47. The 
GISTIC results for our matched melanoma samples are listed in the

Supplementary Data and are presented graphically in Supplementary 
Figure 6. We observed known deletions in 9p21.3 (CDKN2A), 17p13.1 
(TP53) and 10q23.31 (PTEN) and amplifications in 1q31.3 (ASPM) 
and 7q34 (BRAF). We identified a significant amplification signal in 
7p22.1, near the PMS2 locus, and an amplification peak in 5p15.33, 
which  harbors  TERT.  The  latter  supports  the  role  of  telomerase  
maintenance in melanoma based on recurrent somatic mutations in 
the TERT promoter8,9.

We also conducted GISTIC analysis with a focus on triple–wild-type 
melanomas, specifically, 19 matched melanomas that were wild type 
for BRAF, RAS and NF1. The analysis revealed a distinctive amplifi-
cation peak at 4q12, harboring the KIT-KDR locus (Supplementary 
Fig. 7) that was present in two melanomas. KIT and KDR are recep-
tor tyrosine kinases that activate the MAPK pathway48,49. Triple– 
wild-type melanomas carried additional characteristic copy-number 
alterations, including an amplification peak in MAP3K8 in YUROL 
that was not seen in any other melanoma specimen (Supplementary 
Fig. 8a,b). MAP3K8 expression has been implicated as a resistance 
mechanism  to  BRAF-inhibitor  therapy  in  melanoma50.  Another 
amplification peak was seen in YUDATE melanoma that included 
the MAPK1 (ERK2) locus (Supplementary Fig. 8c).

DISCUSSION
The genome-wide mutational analysis of melanoma reinforces the role 
of known frequent mutations in this devastating cancer and enhances 
our understanding of the processes that lead to melanomagenesis. 
This study showed that sun-exposed melanomas harbored a large 
number of missense mutations, but only a few were of the gain-of-
function type characteristic of oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, RAC1, 
MAP2K1, EZH2 and IDH1 that are amenable to targeted therapy. In 
fact, mutations at recurrent positions can be of the inactivating type, 
as was demonstrated for PPP6C5. The majority of the loss-of-function 
changes affect processes involved in cell cycle progression; chroma-
tin remodeling, DNA repair and/or transcription including histone 
methyltransferases (KMT2A, SETD2); and members of the SWI/SNF

modify gene expression that releases normal cellular safeguards or 
constraints for which the design of inhibitors is more challenging.

The results of our large-scale exome sequencing highlight NF1 as 
a major player in melanomagenesis. In our cohort, 46% of BRAF-
RAS–wild-type melanomas harbored NF1 mutations, which are often 
associated with LOH due to hemizygous deletions or copy-neutral 
gene conversions, or carried two or more single-nucleotide variants, 
suggesting  biallelic  mutation.  NF1-BRAF  and  NF1-RAS  double-
mutants displayed considerably less LOH and fewer biallelic NF1 
mutations (4 out of 12) than did NF1-mutant, BRAF-RAS–wild-type 
melanomas (21 of 26), and when tested they were found to express 
normal or high levels of NF1, suggesting a minor role for this tumor 
suppressor in these melanomas. In contrast, all of the NF1-mutant, 
BRAF-NRAS–wild-type melanomas did not express NF1. The loss of 
NF1 expression led to increased RAS activation in most but not all 
of these cases; RAS relative activity remained low in two out of the 
six NF1-null melanoma cell lines, probably because of the effects of 
other RAS-GTPase–activating proteins.

We found that NF1-null melanoma cell lines could be either sensi-
tive or resistant to MEK or ERK inhibitors. We searched for additional 
mutations that may confer resistance to these inhibitors by activating 
alternative signaling pathways. Two of the three selumetinib-resistant  
NF1-mutant melanomas also carried the RAC1P29S mutation (YUHEF 
and YUSOC), in line with a recent publication indicating that RAC1-
mutant  melanomas  are  relatively  resistant  to  MEK  inhibitors51. 
However, the YUTOGS melanoma is also a RAC1P29S-NF1 double-
mutant but was highly sensitive to selumetinib (IC50 = 0.022 µM). We 
speculate that other damaging mutations could facilitate activation 
of the phosphoinositide 3–kinase (PI3K)-mTOR pathway. For exam-
ple, YUHEF melanoma carries three mutations in the RASopathy 
gene SOS1 (p.Pro102Ser, p.Arg398Gly and p.Gly434Val) that may 
confer constitutive RAS activity, and PHLPP2 mutations are present 
in YUSOC (p.Pro142Ser) and YUHEF (p.Ser915Phe). PHLPP1 and 
PHLPP2  (similar  to  PTEN,  which  was  not  altered  in  these  cells)  
are phosphatases that target AKT, PKC, S6K and RAF1, and their 
inactivation has been demonstrated in other cancers52. Furthermore, 
downregulation of PHLPP1 increases AKT activity, enhances the  
proliferation  of  melanoma  cells  and  melanocytes  and  results  in 
anchorage-independent growth of melanocytes53.

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous 
system and causes benign cutaneous neurofibromas and elevated risk 
for multiple Schwann cell tumors54. Epidemiological studies show 
that there is a general increase in the incidence of 13 other cancers 
among people with neurofibromatosis, albeit at a much lower rate, 
and melanoma is one of them55. Interestingly, melanocytes from café- 
au-lait macules of NF1 patients carry a somatic or second-hit muta-
tion in NF1, indicating that a loss of NF1 provides a growth stimu-
lus to normal melanocytes but does not accelerate their malignant  
transformation56. One possibility is that NF1 loss may be a more effec-
tive NRAS activator in the nervous system than in melanocytes57. 
Another likely explanation may relate to the timing of the mutation, 
with inherited loss of NF1 leading to the neurofibromatosis pheno-
type, and somatic mutations later in life, accompanied by additional 
alterations, leading to a variety of human cancers58. A similar obser-
vation has been made for retinoblastoma: although small-cell lung  
cancers show some of the highest somatic RB1 mutation rates, long-
term retinoblastoma survivors with RB1 germline mutations have 
only a slightly increased incidence of secondary lung cancers59.

We identified documented disease-causing mutations in RASopathy 
genes RASA2, PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1 and SPRED predominantly in 

A r t i c l e s

NF1-mutant melanomas, but also in BRAF-RAS mutant and triple–
wild-type tumors, to a lesser degree. To our knowledge this is the 
first report to describe the presence of several known RASopathy 
gene mutations in melanoma, highlighting a possible role for these 
altered genes in cancer pathogenesis. Most of these mutations are 
found in NF1-mutant melanomas, and our functional studies showed 
that a loss of NF1 expression did not always lead to NRAS activation.  
These results raise the intriguing possibility that NF1-mutant melano-
mas may require additional changes for robust MAPK pathway acti-
vation. Indeed, clinically, concurrent NF1 and PTPN11 mutations  
cause severe or lethal forms of Noonan syndrome60,61. There is a case 
of a child with concurrent NF1 and PTPN11 mutation who developed 
bilateral optic nerve glioma, whereas the remaining family members, 
who carried only an NF1 mutation, displayed mild neurofibroma-
tosis symptoms (café-au-lait spots)62. In addition, there is evidence  
that a loss of NF1 expression enhances the activity of noncanonical 
RAS mutations63, which is relevant to our observation of two cases 
of NF1-mutant melanomas, one with KRASA146T mutation and the 
other with KRASQ22K mutation.

Melanoma tumors and cell cultures. Normal human melanocytes (NBMEL) 
were cultured from foreskins of newborn males. The foreskins were incubated 
in dispase overnight at 4 °C, and epidermal melanocytes were further dissoci-
ated after 10 min of incubation in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (GIBCO-Life 
Technologies). The cells were sedimented, and the pellets were incubated in 
OptiMEM (GIBCO), 5% FCS (Gemini Bio-Products), 1% Pen Strep (GIBCO) 
supplemented with 10 ng/ml basis fibroblast growth factor (ConnStem, F1001), 
1 ng/ml heparin (Sigma, H3393), 0.1 mM dbcAMP (Sigma, D-0627) and 0.1 mM  
3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma, I-5879). Melanoma tumors were excised 
to alleviate tumor burden, and cells were cultured in OptiMEM plus 5% FCS 
and  Pen  Strep.  Specimens  were  collected  by  the  Tissue  Resource  Core  of 
the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer with participants’ informed signed consent 
according to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
regulations with a Human Investigative Committee protocol. The melanomas 
used for sequencing were from snap-frozen tumors or from short-term cell  
cultures64.  The  cell  cultures  were  routinely  checked  for  mycoplasma  
contamination and were discarded when they tested positive. Matching normal 
DNA was obtained from circulating lymphocytes or normal skin.

DNA extraction. The DNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used 
to extract DNA from cell pellets and freshly frozen tumors. The OneStep PCR 
Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA) was used to 
remove melanin from highly pigmented samples.

Exome  sequencing  data  analysis.  SNV  and  indel  calling;  somatic  versus  
novel variants. We followed a previously described protocol for read alignment, 
single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and indel calling, data filtering, and somatic 
calling3. In short, we used the bwa program for read mapping and SAMtools 
for SNV calling65,66. SNVs were filtered according to the following quality  
criteria: (i) mutant allele frequency of ≥13%; (ii) SAMtools mapping score  
of ≥40; (iii) at least one forward and one backward read; and (iv) a minimum  
coverage  of  four  mutant  and  eight  total  reads  at  the  variant  position.  
An SNV was called somatic in the absence of variant reads in the germline  
DNA  samples,  with  one  mutant  read  tolerated  in  the  normal  samples,  
and expecting a sufficient variant-to-total-read ratio in tumor and normal  
samples  as  assessed  by  Fisher’s  exact  test  (P  value  threshold  of  0.001). 
Generated data are with respect to Genome Reference Consortium human 
genome build 37 (GRCh37).

Somatic versus novel mutations. For our samples for which we had both 
tumor and matched germline DNA, we derived somatic SNVs, splice variants 
(SVs) and indels. For the entire cohort of matched and unmatched samples, 
we derived all SNVs, SVs and indels that were determined to be ‘novel’, i.e., 
not found in repositories of common human variation (phase 1 data from the 
1,000 Genome Project and 2,577 non-cancer exomes sequenced at Yale) at a 
frequency of less than 0.05% and therefore enriched in somatic and private 
inherited mutations. We used the somatic mutations for the MutSigCV analysis 
and to calculate whether a gene had at least 20% somatic mutations at recurrent 
positions or at least 20% inactivating somatic mutations (integrating somatic 
data from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and TCGA screens66). We 
used the list of mutations that were novel and predicted to be damaging for 
identifying paired and unpaired samples with mutations in driver genes, and 
for detecting gene mutations associated with the NF1 subgroup (redistribution 
analysis, discussed below). For all calculations that compare mutations counts 
across samples, we restricted the counts to genes with consistent coverage 
across samples.

Integrated  mutation  data  from  the  Broad  Institute  of  MIT  and  Harvard 
and TCGA. We integrated melanoma data from a recent publication by the 
Broad Institute2, and from the TCGA project66. For the TCGA project, we 
downloaded the automated somatic calls provided by the Baylor College of 
Medicine (4/17/2014) and Broad Institute (3/22/2014), available at the TCGA 
data portal. Both projects provided the data in MAF format. We removed 
samples that were in common between the data sets before integrating the 
data by calculating the overlap in somatic mutations between the cohorts and 
removing samples that shared a majority of mutations with another screen. 
After consolidation, we created an integrated data set of 397 melanomas from 
the Broad and TCGA cohorts.

Redistribution analysis for identifying co-mutated genes. To identify genes 
that were significantly co-mutated across the melanoma subgroups, we first 
applied the χ2 test to the equality of mutation counts across the four groups 
(NF1, BRAF, RAS and wild type). We additionally performed a redistribution 
analysis by adjusting for the total number of mutations (nt) per group. For each 
gene, we first computed the weighted mutation counts, or expected counts, for 
each group with weights n1/nt, n2/nt, n3/nt and n4/nt, respectively, where n1, n2, 
n3 and n4 are the total number of mutations per group and nt = n1 + n2 + n3 + 
n4. Then a scalar was multiplied by the weighted counts to ensure that the total 
number of counts for the gene stayed the same before and after redistribution. 
A χ2 test was then performed to determine whether the redistribution counts 
were equal across the four groups. For final selection, we filtered for genes with 
a redistribution analysis FDR of <0.2 (Supplementary Data). We performed a 
similar analysis to calculate whether the set of RASopathy genes were associ-
ated with the NF1 subgroup by tallying the mutation across the RASopathy 
genes and performing a redistribution analysis (Supplementary Data).

Gene mutation burden analysis: 20/20 rule. We calculated the top mutated 
and expressed genes on the basis of a heuristic rule12 that selects genes in 
which 20% or more of the observed somatic mutations are at recurrent sites, 
or in which 20% or more of the observed somatic mutations are inactivating 
(i.e., nonsense, splice-site, or indel). To increase power, we decided to inte-
grate the somatic calls from the Yale cohort with the somatic calls from the 
integrated Broad-TCGA cohort for candidate gene identification. Genes with 
>20% somatic mutations and at least 1% frequency in the combined cohort 
were then ranked by the incidence of novel mutations in the entire Yale cohort 
(Table 1 and Supplementary Data).

Gene-mutation burden analysis using MutSigCV. The list of driver genes was 
identified using MutSigCV (Version 1.4)13, which distinguishes significantly 
mutated genes from others by taking into account mutational heterogeneity  
caused by replication timing, gene expression levels and chromatin state. 
We ran MutSigCV using the default input files as provided by the MutSigCV 
download page and prepared the mutational data using a MAF file comprising 
the somatic calls of expressed genes across the 133 matched samples of the 
Yale cohort. We selected significantly mutated genes using an FDR threshold 
of <0.2 among all genes that had at least one somatic mutation.

Survival analysis across the melanoma subgroups. We carried out an analysis 
to determine whether mutational status (NF1, BRAF, RAS and wild type) is 
associated with melanoma survival. The analysis was done for four mutational 
groups (NF1 mutant versus NF1 wild type, BRAFV600 versus BRAF wild type, 
RAS mutant versus RAS wild type, and BRAF-RAS wild type versus BRAF-RAS 
mutant). We considered two types of survival times by taking into account 
(1) the difference between age at last encounter and age of metastasis onset, 
and (2) the difference between age at last encounter and age of primary onset.  
The survival times and vital status were then used to obtain Kaplan-Meier 
curves. The analysis was done both with and without adjustment for age; for 
example, for the NF1 mutant–versus–wild type group analysis (age of metas-
tasis onset), the P values with and without adjustment for age effects were 
0.216 and 0.241, respectively.

CNV analysis. We used Excavator (Version 2.1)46 and GISTIC (Version 
2.0.16)47 to calculate significantly amplified or deleted regions. Excavator was 
run with the default settings. The resulting chromosome-level segmentation 
data (genomic intervals), together with the location of the exome probes, were 
then used in GISTIC to generate the copy-number results. GISTIC was run 
with parameters of logR threshold for calling a segment amplified of ±0.25 
and capping logR values at 2.

Tumor-purity calculation. We calculated sample purity in our paired samples 
by two approaches. The first approach was based on mutant allele frequency 
(MAF) estimation in regions of LOH. First, we established all LOH regions 
using the R module DNACopy. For each LOH region, we determined the 
median MAF for heterozygous inherited SNVs. We then used 2|0.5 – MAF| 
as a proxy for purity. Second, for samples with no LOH, we assumed that the 
majority of somatic mutations were heterozygous and used two times the 
median MAF of somatic mutations as a proxy for purity.

Automated tumor-purity calculation of our 133 paired samples showed 
a mean tumor-purity value of 0.63 ± 0.21, with 1.0 being the value of pure 
samples (Supplementary Data). Purities as low as 26% would theoretically

thresholds and level of coverage. Review of selected samples and/or slides by a 
pathologist showed agreement with the automated analysis, with a mean purity 
of 71.7% across 24 paired and unpaired samples (Supplementary Data).

Sequencing statistics. For our tumor samples, we calculated a mean error rate 
of 0.2% ± 0.08% per called SNV, a mean coverage of 204 ± 76 independent 
reads per base, and coverage of at least eight independent reads across 96.5% 
± 3% of the covered bases. Our matched normal samples were sequenced with 
a slightly smaller coverage of 141 ± 42 independent reads per base.

Variant-call  precision.  We  Sanger  validated  418  novel  SNVs  that  were  
called using our variant-calling pipeline. We measured a precision of 93%, 
corresponding to 389 true positive and 29 false positive variant calls.

Protein blot analyses. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented 
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and the levels of proteins were  
estimated with the Bio-Rad kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For NF1 analysis, cell 
extracts from different melanomas (20 µg/lane) were subjected to protein blot 
analysis with a 3%–8% Tris-acetate gel, Tris-acetate SDS running buffer and 
NuPAGE transfer buffer (Life Technologies, NP0006). The membranes were 
probed with anti-NF1 (Bethyl Laboratories, A300-140A) followed by anti–β-actin  
monoclonal  antibody  (clone  AC-74,  A5316,  Sigma-Aldrich)  as  a  control 
for protein loading. For MEK signaling pathway analysis, normal human 
melanocytes and melanoma cells were either untreated or treated with 100 nM 
selumetinib (Selleckchem Chemicals, S1008). Cells were harvested 1, 6, and 24 h  
later, and cell lysates were subjected to protein blot analysis in 4–12% Bis-Tris 
gels (Novex) as described64. The antibodies used were to phospho-MEK1/2 

pSer217/221 (9121), MEK1/2 (4694), phospho-ERK2 pThr202/Tyr204 (9106), 
and ERK1/2 (4695), all from Cell Signaling Technology.

Analysis of intracellular RAS-GTP. We analyzed the RAS activation state with 
the Active RAS Pull-Down and Detection Kit from Thermo Scientific (16117) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates (400 µg protein) were 
incubated with GST-bound RAF1-RAS binding domain (GST-RAF1-RBD), 
and the levels of RAS-GTP were evaluated by protein blotting of bound mate-
rial with anti-NRAS (or anti-panRAS). Whole-cell lysates (20 µg) were loaded 
in parallel to estimate the input levels of NRAS. The levels of active NRAS were 
estimated by band intensity relative to total NRAS, measured using the NIH 
software ImageJ 1.46r and normalized to NRASQ61R YUFIC melanoma.

Cell  proliferation  assays.  Cell  proliferation  assays  were  performed  in  
96-well plates with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay in tripli-
cate or quadruplet wells, measured at the end of 72 h of treatment with increas-
ing  concentrations  of  selumetinib,  SCH772984  (Selleckchem  Chemicals, 
S7101),  or  the  BRAFV600  inhibitor  vemurafenib  (PLX4032,  Plexxikon).  
The IC50 values (drug concentrations that reduced cell viability to 50% of 
the control) were calculated from the slope of the drug response generated 
in GraphPad Prism.
