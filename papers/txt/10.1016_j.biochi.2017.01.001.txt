The variable manifestation of phenotypes that occur in patients with neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1 (NF1)
includes benign and malignant neurocutaneous tumors for which no adequate treatment exists. Cell-
based screening of known bioactive compounds library identiÔ¨Åed the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
inhibitor Cantharidin and the L-type calcium channel blocker Nifedipine as potential candidates for NF1
pharmacotherapy. Validation of screening results using human NF1-associated malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells showed that Cantharidin effectively impeded MPNST cell growth,
while Nifedipine treatment signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased local tumor growth in an MPNST xenograft animal
model. These data suggest that inhibitors of PP2A, as well as calcium channel blockers, might be used in
broader MPNST preclinical studies as single agents or in combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

1. Introduction

NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Reckling-
hausen's disease, is a frequent human cancer predisposition syn-
drome affecting many organ systems, peripheral nervous system in
particular [1e3]. Typical NF1 symptoms include neuroectodermal
tumors and lesions of other tissue origins, pigmentation patterns,
as well as skeletal abnormalities and cognitive deÔ¨Åcits [3]. Most
NF1 patients develop dermal and plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas - benign
lesions associated with peripheral nerves. Dermal neuroÔ¨Åbromas
are tumors in the skin, while plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas (PNF)
develop along the nerve plexus. PNFs can reach large sizes and
compress nearby nerves, causing pain and a range of dysfunctions;
moreover, PNF can transform into malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [4]. These cancers exhibit highly aggres-
sive metastatic growth and serve as major source of morbidity for
NF1 patients [4,5]. To date there is no established pharmaceutical
treatment for benign and malignant NF1-associated tumors, thus,
the search for novel therapeutic targets for this disease is of intense

scientiÔ¨Åc and clinical interest [6].

NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1 is a monogenic dominantly inherited
autosomal disorder. It occurs due to inactivating mutations in the
NF1 tumor suppressor gene that encodes the Ras-regulatory pro-
tein neuroÔ¨Åbromin [6,7]. NeuroÔ¨Åbromin is broadly expressed and
plays important roles in regulating multiple cellular processes, as
evidenced by the variety of symptoms arising from its loss [3,6].
However, speciÔ¨Åc functions of neuroÔ¨Åbromin remain unclear.
Although many neuroÔ¨Åbromin interactions with other proteins
have been reported in addition to controlling Ras [3], the biological
meaning of these additional interactions is largely undeÔ¨Åned.

Genetic and biochemical screenings can be useful tools for
deÔ¨Åning new protein functions as well as therapeutic targets. Here
we perform cell-based phenotypic screening assay to identify novel
compounds that inhibit proliferation and survival of cells lacking
neuroÔ¨Åbromin. We show that small molecules of two distinct
classes e the protein phosphatese 2 (PP2A) inhibitor Cantharidin
and the calcium antagonist Nifedipine - exhibit selective toxicity
towards NF1-deÔ¨Åcient mouse embryonic Ô¨Åbroblasts (MEFs). We
demonstrate that Cantharidin effectively inhibits growth of human
NF1-associated MPNST cells, suggesting that PP2A might represent
an attractive new target for MPNST pharmacotherapy. Finally, we
show that Nifedipine inhibits cell growth as well as xenograft

tumor growth of an aggressive MPNST cell line, S462TY. These re-
sults suggest that unbiased chemical screens may yield unexpected
candidates for NF1 pharmacotherapy.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell lines

Immortalized murine Nf1-negative and wild type mouse em-
bryonic Ô¨Åbroblasts (MEF Nf1-/- E1A-p53 and MEF Nf1wt E1A-p53)
were generously provided by Dr. Karen Cichowski (Brigham and
Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA).
MPNST cell lines sNF96.2, sNF02.2 and sNF94.3 were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection, S462TY cells were gener-
ously provided by Dr. Timothy Cripe (Nationwide Children's Hos-
pital, OH), ST8814, ST88-3 and 90-8 were generously provided by
Dr. Nancy Ratner (Cincinnati Children's Hospital, OH). Cells were
maintained in Dulbecco's ModiÔ¨Åcation of EAGLE Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/strep-
tomycin and cultured on tissue culture-treated plates under stan-
dard conditions of 37 C and 5% CO2.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modiÔ¨Åed Eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all Invitrogen,
USA) under standard conditions of 37 C and 5% CO2.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay, half inhibitory concentration (IC50)

calculation

MEFs were plated in triplicate for each dose of the compound on
96-well plates at 10000 cells/well in complete medium. Twenty-
four hours after plating, cells were treated with carrier alone
(0.1% DMSO) or bioactive compounds. Cell viability was evaluated
seventy-two hours after addition of drugs using alamarBlue Ô¨Çuo-
rescent assay (Life Technologies, USA). The values of IC50, the drug
concentration required for 50% growth inhibition, were calculated
using software package Calcusyn (Biosoft).

2.3. Small bioactive compound library screening

The ICCB Known Bioactives library (Enzo Life Sciences, USA,
BML-2840-0100) was used for the screening. The screening was
performed using MEF Nf1-/- E1A-p53 in triplicate and repeated 2
times. Drug transfer was performed 24 h after plating using CyBi
Cell Vario automated pipettor, transfer volume 100 nL. DMSO and
staurosporin at the Ô¨Ånal concentration of 5 mM were used as
negative and positive controls respectively. Read-outs were done in
72 h using alamarBlue cytotoxicity assay. Targets were counted
positive if the viability ratio was <0.85 and false discovery rate
(FDR) was <20%.

2.4. Xenoraft studies

Female 6e7 weeks old nu/nu immunodeÔ¨Åcient mice were
injected subcutaneously with 107 S462TY cells in 0.1 ml 30%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences)/PBS. Treatment started when the average
tumor size reached 100 mm3. Nifedipine (Santa Cruz) was prepared
as a suspension in aqueous 0.5% hypromellose/0.2% Tween 80 and

administrated by daily gavage at 50 mg/kg. Norcantharidin (Santa
Cruz) was formulated in PBS and IP injected at 10 mg/kg/day. Tu-
mors were measured with a caliper every tree days. Mice were
sacriÔ¨Åced when tumor size reached 10% of body weight, tumors
were isolated and weighted.

2.5. Statistics

Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance for the IC50 values was calculated by
Holm-Sidak method with a ¬º 5%. For xenograft experiment sta-
tistical signiÔ¨Åcance was estimated using the two-tail Student's t-
test.

3. Results

We used MEF Nf1-/- E1A-p53 cells to assess the effects of 472
small molecules on the growth and survival of NF1-deÔ¨Åcient
neoplastic cells. Nf1-/- E1A-p53 MEFs were created by trans-
forming MEFs harboring a germline bi-allelic inactivating Nf1 mu-
tation, with an E1A oncogene and dominant-negative p53 [8]. Such
transformation partially recapitulates p53 and Rb inactivation that
are often seen in NF1-associated malignancies [9,10].

Fig. 1a shows preliminary screening results identifying 142
compounds that satisÔ¨Åed selection criteria (ratio between vital cells
exposed compounds and negative control < 0.85 and FDR according
to BenjaminidHochberg method < 20%). Compounds with poor
target speciÔ¨Åcity and acute toxicity were excluded from the hit list.
For further studies we selected candidate compounds from the
drug classes most broadly represented in the ‚Äúhit‚Äù list: Cerulenin,
AA.861 (lipid biosynthesis agents), Calphostin C (PKC inhibitors),
LY.294002 (PI3K inhibitors), Nifedipine, Nigericin (ion channel li-
gands), Cantharidin (PP2A inhibitors).

To access selective toxicity of indicated compounds toward NF1-
deÔ¨Åcient cells we exposed MEF Nf1-/- E1A-p53 cells and isogenic
control MEF Nf1wt E1A-p53 cells to various doses of the com-
pounds. The IC50 values for both cell lines were determined for
candidates identiÔ¨Åed by the screening. Of seven initially selected
compounds, only two: Cantharidin and Nifedipine showed
consistent signiÔ¨Åcant differences in suppression of NF1-negative
versus control MEF cell growth (Fig. 1b).

These results were then validated on a panel of seven NF1-
associated human MPNST cell lines S462TY, ST88-3, ST8814, 90-8,
sNF96.2, sNF02.2 and sNF94.3 (Fig. 1c). Cantharidin IC50 values for
all MPNST cell lines tested were comparable to those obtained in
MEF Nf1-/- E1A-p53 (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, S462TY cells were
extremely sensitive to the calcium channel blocker Nifedipine,
however other MPNST cell lines exhibited little sensitivity to this
compound (Fig. 1c).

We next asked whether our in vitro observations might be
recapitulated in vivo. The S462TY MPNST cell line was used to
establish subcutaneous xenograft tumors and therapy was initiated
when average tumor size reached 100 mm3. For these experiments
we used Nifedipine at 50 mg/kg/day and Norcantharidin (NCTD)
(demethylated form of cantharidin with reduced toxicity [11]), at
10 mg/kg/day. Mice in NCTD treated group were sacriÔ¨Åced at day 12
when two of six xenograft tumors reached 10% body weight. The
experiment was stopped at the day 15 when most control mice
required sacriÔ¨Åce, and the tumors were collected. Exposure to

4. Discussion

Current therapeutic options for benign and malignant NF1-
associated tumors are restricted to surgical resection, a treatment
that does not signiÔ¨Åcantly improve prognosis [6]. In this study we
aimed to identify additional, and perhaps more effective, treatment
options for NF1 by identifying novel pharmaceutical agents that
suppress tumor growth without toxic side effects. We took
advantage of a pair of isogenic MEFs (wild type and NF1-deÔ¨Åcient),
as well as human NF1-associated MPNST cells, and screened known
bioactive compounds to identify agents that selectively inhibit
growth of NF1-deÔ¨Åcient cells.

The Ô¨Årst compound selected from the screen, Cantharidin, is a
potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an enzyme that
plays an important role in cell proliferation, survival, and cell-fate
determination [12]. PP2A targets many oncogenic signaling cas-
cades and was initially characterized as a tumor suppressor [12],
however, accumulating evidence points to its anti-apoptotic role in
multiple cancer cell types [12], as well as a contribution to
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms [13]. Pharmaceutical
in-
hibitors of PP2A compromise cancer cell proliferation, survival and
invasion [12,14,15] and are considered promising for treatment of
particular types of cancer [12,13]. In our study, NF1-deÔ¨Åcient MEFs
as well as all NF1-associated MPNST cells were signiÔ¨Åcantly more
sensitive to Cantharidin compared to wild type MEFs, suggesting
that pre-malignant and malignant NF1-associated tumor cells
biology depends on PP2A activity. As selective PP2A inhibitors,
including Cantharidin analogs [11,16,17], have been developed, such
small molecules might represent promising therapeutic agents for
neuroÔ¨Åbromas and MPNSTs alone or in combination with chemo-
therapeutic agents.

Another compound identiÔ¨Åed in our screen, Nifedipine, is a
dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (Fig. 1b). Nifedipine disrupts
extracellular calcium inÔ¨Çux through voltage-dependant calcium
channels and is broadly used as antihypertensive drug [18]. Given
the importance of calcium entry for cell division [19] potential
anticancer effects of calcium antagonists are being discussed
[19e21]. Although Nifedipine showed moderate selective toxicity
toward NF1-deÔ¨Åcient cells in our MEF-based system, the majority
of NF1-associated MPNST cells tested, with the notable exception of
S462TY cells, exhibited little to no response to the compound. It is

not known whether MPNST cells express functioning voltage-
dependent calcium channels and whether alternative mecha-
nisms of calcium signaling system are involved in regulation of
MPNST cell growth. Thus these data suggest that the observed ef-
fects is cell-type speciÔ¨Åc and that Nifedipine might be a perspective
candidate only for selective MPNSTs, such as that represented by
the S462TY cell line.

Out of seven MPNST cell lines used, S462TY, exhibited the most
aggressive growth and was the only cell line that gave rise to
xenograft tumors after subcutaneous injection. Unlike other cell
types, S462TY showed high sensitivity to Nifedipine, but was the
least sensitive to Cantharidin in vitro. Similar results were obtained
in a xenograft experiment. Strikingly, exposure to Nifedipine over a
period of two weeks signiÔ¨Åcantly impeded S462TY tumor growth,
while treatment with the PP2A inhibitor Norcantharidin (NCTD)
showed no tumor suppressive effect (Fig. 2). These observations
point to substantial heterogeneity amongst human MPNSTs in
terms of expression of drug targets, response to inhibitors, and
mechanism of drug resistance.

In conclusion, we show that neuroÔ¨Åbromin deÔ¨Åciency sensitizes
cells to the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor Cantharidin and the
calcium antagonist Nifedipine, addressing potential new roles of
neuroÔ¨Åbromin in calcium signaling and speciÔ¨Åc cascades targeted
by PP2A. Potent inhibition of NF1-associated MPNST cell viability by
Cantharidin suggests that PP2A should be considered as a potential
therapeutic target for these types of tumors. Further investigations
shall focus on mechanisms underlying sensitivity of various NF1-
deÔ¨Åcient cell lines to Nifedipine. That these unexpected targets
emerged from an unbiased screen for small molecules that inhibit
the growth of NF1-deÔ¨Åcient cells suggests that similar approaches
will have value in uncovered new therapeutic targets in NF1-
associated tumors.
