the DNA damage checkpoint maintains genome stability by arresting the cell cycle and promoting DNA repair under 
genotoxic  stress.  Cells  must  downregulate  the  checkpoint  signaling  pathways  in  order  to  resume  cell  division  after 
completing  DNA  repair.  While  the  mechanisms  of  checkpoint  activation  have  been  well-characterized,  the  process 
of  checkpoint  recovery,  and  the  signals  regulating  it,  has  only  recently  been  investigated.  We  have  identified  a  new 
role for the Ras signaling pathway as a regulator of DNA damage checkpoint recovery. Here we report that in budding 
yeast, deletion of the IRA1 and IRA2 genes encoding negative regulators of Ras prevents cellular recovery from a DNA 
damage  induced  arrest.  the  checkpoint  kinase  Rad53  is  dephosphorylated  in  an  IRA-deficient  strain,  indicating  that 
recovery failure is not caused by constitutive checkpoint pathway activation. the ira1Δ ira2Δ recovery defect requires 
the checkpoint kinase Chk1 and the cAMp-dependent protein kinase (pKA) catalytic subunit tpk2. Furthermore, pKA 
phosphorylation sites on the anaphase promoting complex specificity factor Cdc20 are required for the recovery defect, 
indicating a link between the recovery defect and pKA regulation of mitosis. this work identifies a new signaling pathway 
that can regulate DNA damage checkpoint recovery and implicates the Ras signaling pathway as an important regulator 
of mitotic events.

Introduction

Cell  cycle  checkpoints  are  pathways  that  ensure  orderly 
 progression  through  cell  division.1-3  These  pathways  delay  or 
arrest the cell cycle in response to adverse conditions or a failure 
of critical cell cycle events. The DNA damage checkpoint arrests 
the cell cycle to prevent replication of damaged DNA and to pre-
vent  segregation  of  damaged  chromosomes,  which  can  lead  to 
genomic instability or aneuploidy. The DNA damage checkpoint 
can be broken into several steps: initiation, where a DNA lesion is 
detected and the signaling pathways are activated; maintenance, 
where  the  checkpoint  signal  remains  active  as  the  DNA  lesion 
persists;  and  recovery,  where  the  checkpoint  signal  is  attenu-
ated once the lesion has been repaired. In order for a cell to suc-
cessfully cope with a DNA damage event, these phases must be 
appropriately regulated. Therefore, it is important to understand 
the mechanisms controlling checkpoint recovery as well as those 
controlling initiation and maintenance.

The  signaling  pathways  that  respond  to  DNA  damage 
are  conserved  throughout  evolution.4,5  In  the  budding  yeast 
Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  several  types  of  DNA  damage  cause 
cell cycle arrest prior to the onset of anaphase. In metaphase of 

mitosis, sister chromatids are held together by Scc1/cohesin. In 
an unperturbed cell cycle, anaphase begins when Esp1/separase 
cleaves  Scc1/cohesin.  Pds1/securin  sequesters  Esp1/separase  in 
an  inactive  state  and  plays  a  key  role  in  preventing  anaphase 
onset  in  the  setting  of  DNA  damage.  The  ubiquitin  ligase 
anaphase  promoting  complex  in  association  with  the  specific-
ity  factor  Cdc20  (APCCdc20)  drives  the  metaphase-to-anaphase 
transition by promoting ubiquitination of Pds1/securin, target-
ing  it  for  proteasomal  degradation.  This  frees  Esp1/separase, 
which  cleaves  Scc1/cohesin  and  allows  sister  chromatid  seg-
regation.  When  cells  suffer  genotoxic  insult,  DNA  lesions  are 
processed  to  a  form  that  activates  the  upstream  sensor  kinase 
Mec1  (mammalian  ATR).  Mec1  phosphorylates  and  activates 
two effector kinases, Chk1 and Rad53 (in mammalian cells the 
effector  kinases  are  Chk1  and  Chk2).  Chk1  restrains  mitosis 
by  phosphorylating  Pds1,  preventing  its  ubiquitination  by  the 
APC.6-8 Rad53 can re-enforce preanaphase arrest by preventing 
Pds1 association with the APC and by inhibiting the mitotic exit 
network  and  preventing  the  degradation  of  mitotic  cyclins.6,9 
Consequently, Chk1 and Rad53 form two parallel pathways that 
converge  on  the  APC  substrates  to  restrain  mitosis  when  cells 
have damaged DNA.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway can par-
ticipate in the DNA damage checkpoint.10 Deletion of the PKA 
catalytic subunit TPK2 worsens the checkpoint defect of a chk1Δ 
strain (measured by cell division in the presence of DNA damage), 
demonstrating a role for PKA in delaying the metaphase-to-ana-
phase transition in a checkpoint-defective strain. PKA restrains 
mitosis  by  phosphorylating  Cdc20  and  preventing  APCCdc20-
mediated degradation of Pds1 and Clb2.10 PKA responds to intra-
cellular cAMP levels, which are positively regulated by adenlyate 
cyclase  and  negatively  regulated  by  two  phosphodiesterases.11 
Ras1  and  Ras2,  homologs  of  the  mammalian  proto-oncogenic 
Ras family members, activate yeast adenylate cyclase in response 
to increased glucose availability.12,13 Two GTPase activating pro-
teins, Ira1 and Ira2, negatively regulate Ras and thereby restrain 
Ras  and  PKA  signaling.14-16  Consequently,  deletion  of  one  or 
both IRA genes leads to increased Ras activation, accumulation 
of intracellular cAMP and increased PKA activity.11,17

Several  pathways  are  involved  in  DNA  damage  checkpoint 
signal attenuation, and a number of deletion mutants with DNA 
damage recovery defects have been described.18 Various protein 
phosphatases  are  required  for  dephosphorylation  and  inactiva-
tion of Rad53 following transient DNA damage. Different phos-
phatases are required for recovery from different types of damage. 
Recovery  from  a  double  strand  break  requires  the  PP2C-like 
Ptc2,  while  recovery  from  the  DNA  replication  stress  requires 
the  PP1-related  Glc7.19-21  Recovery-defective  phosphatase-de-
ficient strains arrest with high levels of phosphorylated Rad53, 
indicating  that  the  mitotic  exit  defect  is  caused  by  a  failure  in 
inactivating the checkpoint signaling cascade. The DNA damage 
checkpoint signal is also attenuated during adaptation, a process 
where  yeast  cells  resume  cell  division  despite  persistent  irrepa-
rable damage.22,23 Like recovery, adaptation requires checkpoint 
kinase  dephosphorylation  and  deactivation.21,24,25  A  strain  with 
deletion of the gene encoding the SUMO protease Ulp2 is able to 
dephosphorylate Rad53 but nonetheless fails to adapt to a double-
strand DNA break, indicating that both dephosphorylation and 
desumoylation have critical roles in downregulating checkpoint 
activity, although the critical sumoylated checkpoint substrates 
involved in the adaptation defect remain undefined.26

Considering the role of PKA signaling in regulation of mitosis 
and  the  DNA  damage  checkpoint,  we  wondered  if  deletion  of 
the yeast IRA genes would affect DNA damage checkpoint acti-
vation, maintenance, or recovery. This question has bearing on 
human disease: mutation in the human IRA homolog NF1 tumor 
suppressor gene causes neurofibromatosis type 1, which predis-
poses to nervous system tumors originating from Schwann cell 
precursors (OMIM #162200).27-29 Loss of NF1 in Schwann cells 
increases intracellular cAMP levels and leads to PKA-dependent 
phenotypes, with increased cell migration and invasion similar 
to  yeast  cells  with  loss  of  the  IRA  genes.30-32  Individuals  with 
NF1  are  predisposed  to  radiation-induced  neoplasms,  suggest-
ing a checkpoint defect in NF1-deficient cells.33,34 Thus, under-
standing checkpoint function in IRA-deficient yeast cells could 
increase our knowledge of the process of primary tumor forma-
tion in NF1 and the role of NF1 deficiency in tumors that arise 
after radiotherapy.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether loss of the 
NF1  homologs  in  yeast  altered  the  DNA  damage  checkpoint. 
Using a genetic system to transiently activate the DNA damage 
checkpoint pathway, we found that a yeast strain lacking the IRA 
genes  was  able  to  initiate  and  maintain  a  checkpoint-mediated 
arrest.  However,  IRA  deficient  strains  were  unable  to  recover 
from the arrest, despite dephosphorylation of Rad53. We show 
that the recovery defect requires checkpoint activation and PKA 
phosphorylation sites on Cdc20. Our data suggest a model where 
the DNA damage checkpoint pathway recruits PKA signaling to 
re-enforce a preanaphase arrest. When PKA regulatory elements 
are  hyperactivated  by  IRA  deletion,  cells  are  unable  to  restore 
normal PKA signaling after checkpoint downregulation, leading 
to a permanent mitotic arrest. Recently, Ras signaling has also 
been implicated in localization of signaling factors required for 
mitotic exit.35,36 In IRA deletion strains, activated Ras and PKA 
could therefore disrupt several layers of mitotic regulation. This 
work defines a new signaling pathway that can regulate recovery 
from the DNA damage checkpoint and a second pathway that 
compromises  recovery  without  causing  sustained  activation  of 
the DNA damage checkpoint signal.

Results

IRA  deletion  causes  a  defect  in  recovery  from  DNA  damage 
checkpoint arrest. To determine whether Ras deregulation causes 
sensitivity  to  DNA  damage,  we  generated  cdc13-1  strains  with 
deletion of one or both IRA genes. CDC13 encodes a telomere 
binding  protein  that  maintains  telomere  structure  and  recruits 
telomerase to maintain telomere length. cdc13-1 encodes a tem-
perature sensitive variant that dissociates from telomeres at the 
nonpermissive temperature. Cdc13 dissociation causes telomeric 
DNA  to  be  recognized  by  the  DNA  damage  checkpoint,  trig-
gering cell cycle arrest at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. 
cdc13-1  strains  grew  at  25°  and  26°  but  failed  to  grow  at  30°. 
With deletion of one or both IRA genes, the cdc13-1 strain grew 
poorly at 25° and failed to grow at 26° (Fig. 1A). This result sug-
gested  that  a  strain  lacking  the IRA  genes  is  sensitive  to  DNA 
damage caused by deprotection of the telomeres. In accordance 
with a published report from a high throughput study,37 we also 
observed an increase in sensitivity to the DNA alkylating agent 
methyl methanesulfonate in CDC13 strains with IRA deletion, 
suggesting  this  phenotype  is  also  associated  with  chemically-
induced DNA damage (Fig. S1).

One explanation for increased sensitivity to DNA damage is 
a failure of the DNA damage checkpoint to arrest the yeast cell 
cycle. A microcolony assay was performed to determine whether 
an ira1Δ ira2Δ strain was appropriately arresting in response to 
cdc13-1 inactivation. When incubated at 30° for 8 hours, cdc13-1 
cells with an intact DNA damage checkpoint arrest within one 
cell  cycle,  forming  colonies  with  2–4  cells.  Checkpoint  defec-
tive  strains  continue  dividing  despite  the  DNA  damage  and 
form colonies of more than four cells. There was no difference 
in  the  microcolony  size  distribution  of  a  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ 
strain and a cdc13-1 IRA1 IRA2 control (Fig. 1B). 85% ± 3% of 
cdc13-1 microcolonies consisted of 4 or fewer cells, compared to

90% ± 7% of cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ (p = 0.34). This result indi-
cated that the IRA deletion strain did not have a defect in cell 
cycle arrest following cdc13-1 inactivation.

We  next  considered  that  the  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  strain  might  have 
a defect in recovery from transient cdc13-1 inactivation. When 
synchronized  cultures  were  raised  to  the  cdc13-1  non-permis-
sive temperature, then allowed to recover at 21°, viability of the 
cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ strain was significantly reduced (Fig. 1C). 
After  three  hours  of  cdc13-1  inactivation,  11%  ±  4%  of  ira1Δ 
ira2Δ cells were able to form colonies, compared to 57% ± 15% 
of  IRA1  IRA2  controls  (p  <  0.01).  The  recovery  defect  is  not 
caused by IRA deletion alone since a CDC13 ira1Δ ira2Δ grows 
well after 4, 8 and 12 hours of incubation at 32° (Fig. S2). This 
result indicated that deletion of the IRA genes compromises DNA 
damage checkpoint recovery.

To further characterize the nature of the checkpoint recovery 
defect, colonies were inspected microscopically after an 18-hour 
recovery period. In the cdc13-1 control strain, most cells formed 
healthy colonies in the recovery period (Fig. 1D). With increas-
ing cdc13-1 inactivation time, many control colonies had abnor-
mal  morphology  but  still  consisted  of  more  than  four  cells.  In 
contrast,  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  cells  frequently  remained  in  the 
2–4  cell  stage  during  the  recovery  period.  After  three  hours 
of  cdc13-1  inactivation,  75%  of  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  colonies 
consisted of 2–4 cells compared to only 1.3% of cdc13-1 IRA1 
IRA2. In the ira1Δ ira2Δ strain the fraction of 2–4 cell colonies 
increased with longer cdc13-1 inactivation and was tightly corre-
lated with the loss of viability (Fig. S3). This result suggested that 
in the absence of the IRA genes, cells have a significant delay in 
resuming the cell cycle after transient cdc13-1 inactivation, which 
ultimately compromises colony forming ability.

Ras  deregulation  cannot  restrain  mitosis  in  checkpoint-
deficient  cells.  Delayed  recovery  from  cdc13-1-mediated  arrest 
suggested  that  Ras  deregulation  could  delay  mitosis  in  check-
point-proficient cells having a DNA damage signal from unstruc-
tured telomeres. To determine whether Ras-mediated cell cycle 
delay  required  an  intact  DNA  damage  checkpoint,  we  tested 
whether  Ras  deregulation  could  delay  the  cell  cycle  in  check-
point  defective  cells.  Microcolony  assays  were  performed  with 
cdc13-1 strains having CHK1 deletion, PDS1 deletion, or carry-
ing a hypomorphic allele of RAD53. Deletion of IRA1 and IRA2 
did not improve the checkpoint defect of cdc13-1 chk1Δ, cdc13-1 
rad53-21, or cdc13-1 pds1Δ cells (Fig. 2A–C). In fact, IRA dele-
tion slightly worsened the checkpoint defect of a cdc13-1 chk1Δ  
strain.  In  the  cdc13-1  chk1Δ  strain  about  20%  of  colonies  had 
13  or  more  cells,  compared  to  more  than  60%  of  colonies  in 
the cdc13-1 chk1Δ ira1Δ ira2Δ strain. This might be caused by 
acceleration of the G1-S transition or mitotic exit in chk1Δ cells, 
or alternatively if IRA deletion slows the cell cycle, viability of 
the  cells  could  increase  leading  to  more  cells  per  microcolony. 
We also observed a mild but significant increase in the number 
of microcolonies containing more than 4 cells in cdc13-1 ira1Δ 
ira2Δ rad53-21 compared to cdc13-1 rad53-21 controls (Fig. 2B). 
In cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ rad53-21, 84.3% ± 3.2% of colonies had 
>4 cells, compared to 76.0% ± 1.7% in cdc13-1 rad53-21 (mean 
±  standard  deviation  of  three  assays,  p  =  0.016  by  two-tailed 

Student’s  t-test).  Therefore,  in  both  chk1Δ  and  rad53-21  cells, 
IRA deletion increased the number of cells per microcolony. In 
both  cases  this  effect  could  be  due  to  an  accelerated  cell  cycle 
allowing for more cell divisions during the incubation period, or 
 possibly from a cell cycle delay that increases cell viability and 
allows for more divisions producing viable cells. We concluded 
that Ras deregulation caused by IRA deletion is not able to delay 
cell cycle progression in a checkpoint-deficient background.

ira1Δ  ira2Δ  cells  are  proficient  in  dephosphorylating  
Rad53.  A  number  of  DNA  damage  recovery  defective  yeast 
mutants  have  been  described.  Frequently,  such  strains  fail  to 
recover  from  DNA  damage-induced  arrest  because  they  are 
unable to inactivate the checkpoint kinase Rad53. Surprisingly, 
we found that the recovery-defective cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ strain 
was proficient in Rad53 dephosphorylation, indicating the Rad53 
branch  of  the  checkpoint  was  appropriately  turned  off  in  this 
strain. In both IRA1 IRA2 and ira1Δ ira2Δ strains, Rad53 was 
dephosphorylated  after  60  to  120  minutes  of  recovery  from  a 
four-hour  cdc13-1  inactivation  in  synchronized  cells  (Fig.  3A). 
There are two Rad53 bands in recovered cells due to a mitosis 
specific  phosphorylation  of  Rad53,  which  does  not  activate  its 
kinase activity.38,39 We confirmed that the T = 180 Rad53 shift 
was  equivalent  to  that  seen  in  nocodazole-treated  cells,  which 
arrest  in  mitosis  without  activating  Rad53  (Fig.  3B).  Despite 
equal  kinetics  of  checkpoint  inactivation,  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ 
cells  failed  to  progress  through  mitosis  up  to  three  hours  after 
recovery (Fig. 3C). While cdc13-1 cells began entering anaphase 
after 120 minutes of recovery, shortly after Rad53 dephosphor-
ylation,  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  cells  maintained  the  preanaphase 
arrest  for  up  to  180  minutes.  The  delay  in  mitotic  progression 
despite  Rad53  dephosphorylation  was  confirmed  in  triplicate 
assays  (Fig.  S4).  We  concluded  that  persistent  checkpoint  sig-
naling  is  unlikely  to  be  responsible  for  the  recovery  defect  in 
cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ cells. Although we did not directly examine 
the phosphorylation state of Chk1 in these strains, we consider it 
unlikely that persistent Chk1 activation is responsible for the cell 
cycle delay (see Discussion).

IRA  deletion  causes  permanent  cell  cycle  arrest  in  cells 
recovering from DNA damage. We observed an increase in the 
number  of  2–4  cell  colonies  in  the  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  strain 
after 18 hours of recovery from cdc13-1 inactivation (Fig. 1D); 
however, this result does not establish whether the arrested cells 
at 18 hours eventually resume cell division. In order to examine 
the permanency of the checkpoint recovery defect, we adapted an 
approach to monitor individual cells over several days of recov-
ery from a DNA damage mediated arrest.40 Individual G1 cells 
were micromanipulated onto 32° YPD agar, maintained at 32° 
for  three  hours,  then  returned  to  21°.  Colonies  were  inspected 
microscopically after 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours of recovery and clas-
sified  as  visible  to  the  naked  eye  (Recovered),  microscopically 
visible consisting of 3 or more cells (Microscopic), or as a single 
large-budded  cell  (2-cell).  The  kinetics  of  checkpoint  recovery 
differed between cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ strains (Fig. 
4).  More  than  90%  cdc13-1  cells  re-budded  within  6  hours  of 
recovery and the vast majority of these cells went on to form vis-
ible colonies within 72 hours (Fig. 4A). In contrast, fewer than

half of cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ cells re-bud-
ded within 6 hours. While some of these 
late-recovering  cells  eventually  re-bud-
ded, about half (25% of the total popu-
lation)  never  re-budded  and  were  still 
2-cell colonies after 72 hours of recovery 
(Fig. 4B). This result suggested that most 
ira1Δ ira2Δ cells have a delay in mitotic 
exit,  with  a  subset  completely  failing  to 
re-enter the cell cycle after cdc13-1 arrest. 
Permanent 2-cell colonies were extremely 
rare in cdc13-1 cells, with only one such 
event observed in over 150 cells examined 
across  three  separate  assays.  The  perma-
nent 2-cell arrest required cdc13-1. When 
treated similarly, >95% of CDC13 ira1Δ 
ira2Δ cells formed visible colonies after 72 
hours  of  recovery  (data  not  shown).  We 
used  the  frequency  of  permanent  2-cell 
arrest  in  subsequent  assays  to  character-
ize  the  signaling  components  required 
for  the  Ras-mediated  checkpoint  recov-
ery defect. This criteria is more stringent 
than the scoring approach used in Figure 
1D, which grouped colonies having 2–4 
cells  together  and  did  not  account  for 
late-recovering cells. This result indicated 
that  the  cell  cycle  arrest  of  ira1Δ  ira2Δ 
cells  after  cdc13-1  inactivation  is  a  per-
manent state, with cells remaining in the 
2-cell stage for several days after the DNA 
damage signal is deactivated.

Permanent  cell  cycle  arrest  requires 
Tpk2,  Chk1  and  PKA  phosphoryla-
tion  of  Cdc20.  Deletion  of  IRA1  and 
IRA2 leads to increased Ras2 activation, 
which  increases  intracellular  cAMP  and 
promotes  signaling  through  the  cAMP-
dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. 
PKA has been shown to participate in the 
DNA  damage  checkpoint.  We  therefore 
sought  to  determine  whether  the  recov-
ery defect in the ira1Δ ira2Δ strain was 
due to deregulation of PKA. Strains were 
treated  as  described  for  the  single-cell 
recovery  assay  and  colonies  were  exam-
ined after 72 hours of recovery. In this set 
of assays, 48.1% ± 9.6% of cdc13-1 ira1Δ 
ira2Δ  cells  were  permanently  arrested, 
compared  to  less  than  1%  of  control 
cdc13-1  cells  (Fig.  5A).  With  deletion 
of  the  PKA  catalytic  subunit-encoding 
TPK2  gene,  the  2-cell  fraction  dropped 
to 14.8% ± 3.0% (p < 0.05 compared to

conditions  such  as  increased  tempera-
ture  or  α-factor  recovery  used  during 
the experiment.

During  a  DNA  damage-induced 
arrest,  PKA  can  re-enforce  a  cell  cycle 
delay  by  phosphorylating  Cdc20  and 
preventing ubiquitin-mediated degrada-
tion of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1 and 
the mitotic cyclin Clb2 by the anaphase 
promoting  complex  (APC).10  We  rea-
soned that IRA deletion might compro-
mise DNA damage checkpoint recovery 
by deregulating PKA, leading to consti-
tutive  APCCdc20  inhibition.  This  model 
predicted  that  preventing  Cdc20  phos-
phorylation by PKA would be sufficient 
to rescue the recovery defect. To test this 
model we introduced plasmids contain-
ing wild-type CDC20 or an allele with 
mutation  in  two  PKA  phosphorylation 
sites,  S52  and  S88,  into  cdc13-1  IRA1 
IRA2  or  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  strains.10 
The mutant CDC20 allele significantly 
rescued  the  2-cell  arrest  in  the  ira1Δ 
ira2Δ strain, lowering the 2-cell popula-
tion from 40.1% ± 6.2% to 6.2% ± 2.5% 
(p < 0.01, Fig. 5C). Thus, the recovery 
defect in an ira1Δ ira2Δ strain requires 
PKA phosphorylation of sites on Cdc20.
In  summary,  we  found  that  a  yeast 
strain  lacking  the  Ras  GTPase  activat-
ing  proteins  Ira1  and  Ira2  is  defective 
in  DNA  damage  checkpoint  recovery. 
The defect requires Chk1-mediated cell 
cycle  arrest,  PKA  catalytic  activity  and 
PKA  phosphorylation  of  Cdc20.  Our 
data  suggest  that  PKA  can  inappropri-
ately  restrain  mitosis  by  re-enforcing 
cell  cycle  arrest  in  a  checkpoint-  and 
Pds1-dependent manner after a transient

cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ) indicating that Tpk2 is required for the full 
recovery defect in the IRA deletion strain.

We next asked whether the recovery defect in ira1Δ ira2Δ cells 
was checkpoint-dependent. We found that deletion of CHK1 sig-
nificantly rescued the 2-cell arrest in cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ cells 
(Fig. 5B). While 24.5% ± 6.6% of cdc13-1 ira1Δ ira2Δ cells were 
permanently arrested, only 4.8% ± 0.7% of cdc13-1 chk1 ira1Δ 
ira2Δ cells had the phenotype (p < 0.05). This result supports 
a  model  where  a  Chk1-dependent  cell  cycle  arrest  is  required 
for  the  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  recovery  defect.  This  result  also  ruled  out 
the possibility that permanent 2-cell arrest was caused by other 

Nutrient-sensing pathways play a role in DNA damage check-
point  recovery.  Eukaryotic  cells  respond  to  DNA  damage  by 
activating  checkpoint  pathways  that  allow  cells  to  cope  with 
genotoxic  stress.  Recently,  signaling  pathways  that  respond 
to  nutrients  have  been  implicated  in  the  DNA  damage  check-
point. In budding yeast the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway responds 
to  glucose  and  generally  promotes  cell  growth  and  division.41

cells experiencing a DNA damage signal. In the work presented 
here we tested whether increased Ras signaling could modify the 
DNA  damage  response  in  cells  with  an  intact  checkpoint.  We 
have shown that (1) cells with high Ras activity are defective in 
checkpoint  recovery,  (2)  the  recovery  defect  requires  an  intact 
checkpoint  and  PKA  signaling  to  Cdc20  and  (3)  the  recovery 
defect  is  different  from  most  other   recovery-defective  strains 
because the checkpoint signaling pathway is appropriately down-
regulated in Ras de-regulated cells.

Signaling requirements for a Ras-mediated recovery defect. 
When one or both IRA genes are deleted, two downstream path-
ways  are  activated:  the  PKA  pathway  and  a  MAPK  pathway 
promoting cell morphology changes. Our data suggest that the 
PKA pathway is the branch required for a recovery defect, since 
deletion  of  the  PKA  catalytic  subunit  TPK2  partially  rescued 
the recovery defect. Incomplete rescue may be due to functional 
overlap between the three PKA catalytic subunits (TPK-1, -2 and 
-3) encoded in yeast. Both TPK1 and TPK2 can participate in 
checkpoint-mediated preanaphase arrest,10 and all three subunits 
can  regulate  mitosis  under  different  nutrient  conditions.42  We 
consider it likely that Tpk1 is able to prevent recovery, although 
less efficiently, in the absence of TPK2.

PKA  supports  preanaphase  arrest  in  DNA-damaged  cells 
lacking  CHK1.10  We  found  that  increased  Ras-PKA  signaling 
prevented DNA damage checkpoint recovery, resulting in a loss 
of viability with cdc13-1 inactivation. The Ras deregulated strain 
characteristically remained arrested in the 2-cell state after the 
DNA damage stimulus was removed. In cells lacking CHK1, the 
population of permanently arrested cells was significantly dimin-
ished, indicating that cells unable to fully activate the checkpoint 
are less susceptible to the recovery defect. We propose that the 
recovery defect of Ras deregulated cells requires both PKA cata-
lytic activity and robust checkpoint activation.

We  predicted  that  the  anaphase  inhibitor  Pds1  would  be 
required  for  the  recovery  defect  in  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ.  The 
single-cell  recovery  approach  was  not  suitable  in  pds1Δ  strains 
because  the  cells  re-budded  during  the  cdc13-1  inactivation 
period. This result suggested that IRA deletion was not delaying 
mitosis in the absence of Pds1. Consistent with this observation, 
IRA deletion did not rescue the checkpoint defect of a cdc13-1 
pds1Δ strain in a microcolony assay, further demonstrating that 
the cell cycle delay in Ras de-regulated cells requires Pds1. This 
is  in  accordance  with  previous  work  showing  that  high  cAMP 
inhibits  mitosis  in  a  Pds1-dependent  manner  during  nutrient-
limiting conditions.43

PKA regulates mitosis by modulating the anaphase promot-
ing  complex  specificity  factor  Cdc20.  PKA  phosphorylation  of 
Cdc20  at  two  serine  residues  is  required  for  PKA  to  restrain 
mitosis  in  a  chk1Δ  cell.  A  mutant  CDC20  allele  defective  for 
PKA-mediate phosphorylation significantly rescued the recovery 
defect  in  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  cells,  supporting  a  model  where 
PKA is recruited by the fully-activated DNA damage checkpoint 
to phosphorylate Cdc20 and prevent mitotic progression by pre-
venting Pds1 degradation.

Taken  together,  our  data  suggest  that  Ras  deregulation  acts 
through PKA to inhibit mitosis in recovering cells by preventing

arrested cultures were raised to 32° and released from the G1 arrest by 
micromanipulation onto 32° YpD agar. After three hours at 32°, plates

indicated times and classified as visible to the naked eye (Recovered),

Cdc20-mediated degradation of Pds1. According to our model, in 
a normal cell with an intact checkpoint, PKA signaling is rewired 
to target mitotic substrates. When the checkpoint is deactivated, 
the PKA regulatory mechanisms, including Ira1 and Ira2, act to 
restore basal cAMP-PKA status to allow mitotic progression. In 
the absence of IRA1 and IRA2, PKA signaling cannot be reset 
after the checkpoint-dependent rewiring, leading to permanent 
cell cycle arrest. We do not know whether high cAMP levels are 
maintained  during  the  arrest,  or  if  the  PKA  catalytic  activity 
becomes uncoupled from cAMP availability. However, since IRA 
deletion  strains  are  known  to  have  prolonged  cAMP  elevation 
after glucose stimulation of starved cells,14,15 the former situation 
seems more likely.

Rad53  is  dephosphorylated  in  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  cells.  To 
determine  if  the  DNA  damage  checkpoint  is  being  appropri-
ately  turned  off  in  IRA  deletion  cells,  we  examined  Rad53

these strains; however, we consider this unlikely. 
We  have  shown  that  signaling  through  Chk1 
alone is not sufficient to maintain DNA damage 
induced preanaphase delay.7 In addition the Haber 
group showed that degradation of Rad53 allowed 
cell division after a double stranded break in an 
adaptation deficient strain, suggesting that Rad53 
inactivation  was  sufficient  for  resuming  the  cell 
cycle during adaptation.24 In the present work, a 
cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  strain  containing  a  Cdc20 
allele  with  mutations  in  two  PKA  phosphoryla-
tion  sites  was  found  to  be  recovery-proficient. 
The  mutant  form  of  Cdc20  cannot  override  the 
DNA damage arrest in a cell with an intact Chk1 
pathway.10 Therefore, the ability of Cdc20 mutant 
cells to recover from cdc13-1 arrest suggests that 
the  Chk1  branch  of  the  checkpoint  pathway  is 
inactivated in these cells.

Possible  mechanisms  for  PKA-mediated 
cell cycle arrest. It is tempting to speculate that 
physical  relocalization  of  the  PKA  holoenzyme 
is  responsible  for  the  recovery  defect  in  IRA 
deletion cells. PKA kinase activity is negatively 
regulated  by  the  regulatory  subunit,  encoded 
by  BCY1.  Phosphorylation  of  the  PKA  regula-
tory subunit is known to influence its subcellu-
lar  localization  during  heat  stress  and  nutrient 
deprivation  and  recent  work  in  our  laboratory 
indicates  that  R  subunit  phosphorylation  is 
required for PKA to delay mitotic progression in 
chk1Δ cells (Searle et al. submitted). How might 
this model explain the recovery defect? The PKA 
holoenzyme might be recruited to nuclear sub-
strates, with constitutive Ras activation generat-
ing high cAMP, leading to chronic activation of 
the catalytic subunits. Conversely, relocalization 
of the R subunits to the cytoplasm during DNA 
damage  could  physically  separate  the  C  and  R 
subunits,  allowing  high  PKA  activity  in  the 
nucleus. It is also possible that the holoenzyme 
localizes  to  cytoplasmic  cell  cycle  regulatory 
complexes  located  at  the  bud  neck  and  spindle 
pole body. These models are not mutually exclu-
sive.  Future  work  will  define  what  aspects  of 
PKA regulation contribute to the recovery defect 
in IRA deletion cells. We recently defined these 
mechanisms  for  PKA’s  role  in  re-enforcing  the 
checkpoint  (Searle  et  al.  submitted).  It  will  be 
interesting to learn whether the recovery defect 
represents  a  persistent  over-activation  of  the 
same  mechanism,  or  if  different  processes  are 
involved in the recovery defect. For example, the aurora kinase 
Ipl1 and PKA have overlapping substrate specificities. Ipl1 can 
phosphorylate kinetochore substrates to regulate kinetochore-
microtubule  attachment.44,45  PKA  can  phosphorylate  targets 
at  the  kinetochore,  which  might  modify  spindle  attachment

phosphorylation  status,  a  marker  of  checkpoint  activation.  We 
found that Rad53 was dephosphorylated with wild-type kinetics 
in ira1Δ ira2Δ cells, although the cells did not progress through 
mitosis in the time frame examined. This result does not directly 
address a role for Chk1 in maintaining the checkpoint arrest in

dynamics.46 When PKA is recruited in the DNA damage check-
point, there may be inappropriate phosphorylation of kineto-
chore substrates, which would inhibit microtubule attachment 
and delay mitosis through activation of the spindle checkpoint. 
We are currently investigating whether the spindle checkpoint 
has a role in the PKA-mediated recovery defect.

Potential  roles  for  PKA  in  neurofibromatosis  type  1 
 associated tumors. The IRA genes are homologs of the human 
NF1 tumor suppressor, a Ras-GAP that is mutated in the tumor 
predisposition  syndrome  neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1).  The 
disease  is  highly  pleiotrophic,  but  one  severe  consequence  of 
NF1  is  a  predisposition  toward  malignant  peripheral  nerve 
sheath  tumors  (MPNST)  arising  from  Schwann  cell  progeni-
tors. Schwann cells proliferate in response to cAMP and NF1-
deficient Schwann cells have high cAMP levels, although unlike 
yeast this increase is not mediated by Ras. If the role for PKA in 
the DNA damage response is conserved in mammalian cells, the 
Schwann cell component of a nerve sheath tumor might respond 
differently to DNA damage. Since MPNSTs respond poorly to 
chemotherapy, it is possible that malignant cells have adapted to 
checkpoint deregulation and consequently are less susceptible to 
DNA damage. In summary, we identified a new role for Ras and 
PKA in regulating the DNA damage response in budding yeast. 
This signaling pathway might contribute to tumor progression in 
individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Materials and Methods

Strain growth and media. Yeast strains were grown in standard 
yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) media. α-factor synchro-
nization was performed in YPD pH 3.9. When plasmid selection 
was  required,  strains  were  grown  in  synthetic  complete  media 
lacking leucine (C-Leu). Unless noted, strains were grown at 21°.
Strain and plasmid generation. Strains and plasmids used in 
this study are shown in Table 1. All strains are derived from the 
Y300  background.47  ira1Δ::URA3  and  ira2Δ::URA3  in  Y300 
were generated by one-step gene deletion using a knockout cas-
sette generated by PCR from the pRS416 plasmid. Primers were 
designed with homology to the 5' and 3' UTR of IRA1 or IRA2 
and homology to pRS416, such that the PCR product contained 
the  URA3  marker  and  ~40  bp  of  homology  to  the  IRA  flank-
ing regions (sequences are available upon request). The knock-
out cassette was transformed by standard lithium acetate/PEG/
heat  shock,  except  for  cdc13-1  strains  where  the  heat  shock 
was  omitted  and  cells  were  incubated  in  Li-PEG  for  18  hours 
before  plating.  IRA  deletion  strains  were  back-crossed  to  the 
Y300  background  to  generate  mating  type  α  progeny,  which 
were  then  crossed  to  Y818  or  Y831  and  sporulated  to  obtain 
cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  chk1Δ  and  cdc13-1  ira1Δ  ira2Δ  rad53-21. 
YMW544 and YMW545 were obtained by crossing YMW199 
to  a  pds1Δ::LEU2  α  Y300  strain.  The  tpk2Δ::KAN  allele  was 
back-crossed to the Y300 background from the Open Biosystems 
yeast  deletion  strain,  then  mated  to  YMW142  and  YMW199 
to  obtain  YMW257  and  YMW512,  respectively.  Plasmids 
pMW034 and pMW036 were constructed by SmaI-SpeI digest 
of  pJS3  (HA-CDC20-WT )  or  pJS6  (HA-CDC20-S52A-S88A)
