Abstract

Schwannomas are tumors formed by proliferation of dedifferentiated Schwann cells. Patients with neuroﬁbro-
matosis 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis develop multiple schwannomas in peripheral and cranial nerves. Al-
though benign, these tumors can cause extreme pain and compromise sensory/motor functions, including
hearing and vision. At present, surgical resection is the main treatment modality, but it can be problematic
because of tumor inaccessibility and risk of nerve damage. We have explored gene therapy for schwannomas,
using a model in which immortalized human NF2 schwannoma cells expressing a ﬂuorescent protein and
luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Direct injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)
serotype 1 vector encoding caspase-1 (ICE) under the Schwann-cell speciﬁc promoter, P0, leads to regression of
these tumors with essentially no vector-mediated neuropathology, and no changes in sensory or motor function.
In a related NF2 xenograft model designed to cause measurable pain behavior, the same gene therapy leads to
tumor regression and concordant resolution of tumor-associated pain. This AAV1-P0-ICE vector holds promise
for clinical treatment of schwannomas by direct intratumoral injection to achieve reduction in tumor size and
normalization of neuronal function.

Introduction

Multiple schwannomas in peripheral and cranial

nerves are the hallmark of neuroﬁbromatosis 2 (NF2)
and schwannomatosis,
two forms of neuroﬁbromatoses,
classiﬁed as neurocutaneous syndromes, with incidences of
about 1 in 32,000 and 1 in 1,000,000, respectively (Antinheimo
et al., 2000; Baser et al., 2006). Schwannomas are benign tumors
composed of neoplastic dedifferentiated Schwann cells.
Although typically nonmalignant and slow growing, these
tumors can have devastating consequences for patients.
Schwannomas in NF2 are frequently associated with neuro-
logical deﬁcits, such as paresthesias, weakness, or hearing
loss, and similar tumors in schwannomatosis often cause ex-
cruciating pain (Huang et al., 2004; Lu-Emerson and Plotkin,
2009). Some schwannomas become very large, causing com-
pression of adjacent organs or structures, and can lead to
paralysis or death due to progressive spinal cord or brainstem

compression. The standard of care for patients with NF2 and
schwannomatosis is surgical resection or radiosurgery of
symptomatic tumors to reduce tumor size. Unlike in the case
of sporadic schwannomas, in which typically only a single
tumor is present and surgery is generally an efﬁcacious
treatment strategy as long as the lesion is accessible for re-
section (Lu-Emerson and Plotkin, 2009), in schwannomatosis
and NF2, which present with multiple tumors, resection is
confounded by both the inaccessibility of many tumors and
by risk of nerve damage, including major motor dysfunction,
signiﬁcant sensory loss (including deafness in the case of
NF2 vestibular schwannomas), and neuropathic pain. Thus,
for most individuals there is substantial morbidity associ-
ated with schwannomas in both NF2 and schwannomatosis,
as well as with the current therapies. This suffering and
debility, in combination with the paucity of therapeutic op-
tions, makes the treatment of schwannomas a major unmet
medical need.

AAV-CASPASE-1 REGRESSION OF SCHWANNOMAS

153

The underlying molecular abnormality in NF2 is a germ-
line mutation of the NF2 gene. Somatic loss of the normal
remaining NF2 allele in Schwann cells leads to deregulated
growth of neoplastic Schwann cells with schwannoma for-
mation (Rouleau et al., 1993). The timing of loss of the second
wild-type allele may occur during development, as Schwann
cells move out along axons and begin myelination, or
in response to injury when Schwann cells dedifferentiate
and commence proliferation ( Jessen and Mirsky, 2005;
McClatchey and Giovannini, 2005). In schwannomatosis
some patients have a germline mutation in the SMARCB/
IN11 gene with a second hit in Schwann cells leading to
schwannoma formation (Hulsebos et al., 2007); in addition,
the majority of these tumors harbor additional mutations in
the NF2 gene ( Jacoby et al., 1997; Hadﬁeld et al., 2008).

In initial

treatment paradigms, we used a mouse
schwannoma model in which an immortalized cell line de-
rived from human NF2 schwannoma cells (HEI-193) (Hung
et al., 2002) was genetically modiﬁed to express ﬁreﬂy lucif-
erase (Fluc) and the ﬂuorescent protein, mCherry (desig-
nated HEI-193FC), and implanted subcutaneously in nude
mice. Using this model, we demonstrated that intratumoral
injection of a herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) amplicon vector
expressing caspase-1 (interleukin-b-converting enzyme; ICE)
under the Schwann cell-speciﬁc P0 promoter led to tumor
regression (Prabhakar et al., 2010). This gene therapy ap-
proach had two limitations; the subcutaneous location used
was not clinically relevant and the HSV amplicon vector
employed has never been used in clinical trials.

In the present study we used a more biologically relevant
tumor model in which these human HEI-193FC schwanno-
ma cells are implanted into the sciatic nerve of nude mice
(Saydam et al., 2011). We explored the use of recombinant
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, which are well estab-
lished as safe in clinical trials, and found that among the
serotypes tested by direct injection into the mouse sciatic
nerve (AAV1, AAVrh8, AAVrh10), AAV1 proved to be the
most efﬁcient in transducing Schwann cells (M.S.E. and
G.J.B., unpublished data). Here, we demonstrate that direct
injection of an AAV1-P0-ICE vector into intrasciatic distal
schwannomas both prevented tumor development and led
to regression of well-established tumors, as assessed by
in vivo bioluminescence imaging and correlative histo-
pathology. Tumors injected with a control vector, AAV1-
P0-GFP, continued to grow. In a proximal sciatic nerve
implantation model, designed to cause painlike behavior as
assessed by plantar von Frey withdrawal threshold (i.e.,
mechanical sensitization), intratumoral AAV1-P0-ICE injec-
tion alleviated pain sensitivity in parallel with regression of
tumors. Neuropathological evaluation of Epon and parafﬁn
sections of sciatic nerves of both nude and immunocompe-
tent mice injected with AAV1-P0-ICE showed no evidence of
inﬂammation or axonal degeneration, and only rare macro-
phages, consistent with the absence of behavioral changes
in pain sensitivity or motor skills in these vector-injected
animals.

Materials and Methods

Cell culture

The HEI-193 human schwannoma cell line (from D.J. Lim,
House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, CA) was established from

a schwannoma in a patient with NF2, immortalized with
human papillomavirus E6/E7 genes (Hung et al., 2002) and
maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
with 2 lM forskolin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), recombi-
nant glial growth factor (14 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO), and G418 disulfate salt (50 lg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). To
obtain the HEI-193FC cell line, HEI-193 cells were infected
with lentivirus encoding Fluc and mCherry (Prabhakar et al.,
2010). Human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (American
Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA) was grown
in DMEM–F12 (1:1) (GIBCO-BRL, Rockville, MD). HEK-293T
human embryonic kidney cells (from M. Calos, Stanford
University, Stanford, CA) were grown in DMEM. For all
cell types, growth media were supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) and cells were main-
tained at 37°C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and
95% air.

AAV vector design and packaging

AAV vector plasmids dsAAV-P0-ICE and dsAAV-P0-GFP
were derived from the plasmid dsAAV-CBA-GFP-BGHpA
(Sena-Esteves laboratory). This plasmid carries two AAV2 in-
verted terminal repeat (ITR) elements, one wild type and one in
which the terminal resolution site was deleted, as described
(McCarty et al., 2003), generating a vector that is packaged as a
double-stranded molecule. The dsAAV-P0-ICE plasmid was
generated by replacing the CBA-GFP cassette in the parent
plasmid with the PCR-ampliﬁed rat P0 promoter (1.1 kb; for
full details of the P0 promoter see Brown and Lemke, 1997) and
cDNA, using the plasmid HSV-P0-ICE (Prabhakar et al., 2010)
as a template and the following primers: P0-1, AAAGGTAC
Cacgagcattctcgaactctccaaa; P0-2, AAAACTAGTtctgcagaattcg
atatcaagcttgg; mCaspase-1.1, aaaactagtgccaccatggctgtgagggc
aaagaggaaG; mCaspase-1.2, AAAGCGGCCGCttaatgtcccggg
aagaggtagAAA. The dsAAV-P0-GFP plasmid was generated
by replacing the chicken b-actin (CBA) promoter in the parent
plasmid with the PCR-ampliﬁed rat P0 promoter. Both AAV
vectors carry the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation
signal. The identity of all PCR-ampliﬁed sequences was con-
ﬁrmed by sequencing.

AAV1 serotype vectors were produced by transient co-
transfection of 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation
of vector plasmid (dsAAV-P0-ICE or dsAAV-P0-GFP), ade-
noviral helper plasmid pFD6, and a plasmid encoding the
AAV1 cap gene (pXR1), as previously described (Broekman
et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, AAV vectors were puriﬁed by iodixanol
gradient centrifugation followed by column chromatography
with HiTrap Q anion-exchange columns (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ). The virus-containing fractions were con-
centrated with Centricon 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff
(MWCO) centrifugal devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and
the titer (genome copies [GC]/ml) was determined by real-
time PCR ampliﬁcation with primers and probe speciﬁc for
the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal.

Luminescence cell viability assay

The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Pro-
mega, Madison, WI) was used to determine the number of
viable cells in culture on the basis of quantitation of ATP
levels, an indicator of metabolically active cells. The system

154

detects as few as 15 cells per well 10 min after adding reagent
and mixing, resulting in cell lysis and the generation of a
luminescent signal proportional
to the amount of ATP
present. Ten thousand HEI-193, 293T, or SH-SY5Y cells were
plated into the wells of 96-well plates and infected in tripli-
cate with the AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP vector at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10,000 GC/cell to achieve
>90% infection. After 72 hr, medium was aspirated off and
cells were incubated in 100 ll of fresh medium containing
25 ll of CellTiter-Glo reagent for 10 min at room temperature.
The luminescence was measured with a luminometer (Dynex
Technologies, Chantilly, VA).

Animals

All animal experimentation was approved by and con-
ducted under the oversight of the Massachusetts General
Hospital (Boston, MA) Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Animals, nu/nu and C57BL/6 mice, were kept on
a 12:12 light-to-dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and
water. Animals were checked daily to evaluate health.

Generation of tumors and vector injection

Sciatic nerve schwannomas were generated by direct in-
jection of schwannoma cells into the left sciatic nerve of
isoﬂurane-anesthetized mice, as described (Saydam et al.,
2011). Speciﬁcally, cells were implanted approximately 4 mm
distal to the sciatic notch at a point midway between the
sciatic notch and the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve into the
common peroneal, tibial, and sural branches. For all experi-
ments other than the experiment shown in Fig. 7, HEI-193FC
cells were trypsinized and rinsed, and 30,000 cells in a vol-
ume of 1 ll of culture medium were injected into the distal
sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice (nu/nu, 5-week-old
females; National Cancer Institute [NCI]), using a glass mi-
cropipette and a gas-powered microinjector
(IM-300;
Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). For the data shown in Fig. 7, a
similar implantation procedure was performed, differing
only in that cells (60,000 in 1 ll) were implanted more
proximally in the sciatic nerve. Tumor growth was moni-
tored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging at weekly inter-
vals, using the CMIR Image program (an image display and
analysis suite developed in the Interactive Data Language
[IDL; Research Systems/Exelis Visual Information Solutions,
Boulder, CO]) as described (Prabhakar et al., 2010). Brieﬂy,
mice were injected intraperitoneally with the Fluc substrate
d-luciferin, and, 5 min later, signal was acquired with a high-
efﬁciency IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton,
MA) with an XGI-8 gas anesthesia system (Caliper Life Sci-
ences) for Fig. 3A and a cryogenically cooled, high-efﬁciency
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera system (Roper Scien-
tiﬁc, Trenton, NJ) for Fig. 3B.

After 4 weeks,

tumors that grew progressively were
treated with AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP. The schwan-
nomas were injected twice, 1 week apart, with 1010 vector
GC in 1 ll, using either AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP
(over approximately 10 sec), under direct visualization as
described for injection of tumor cells (Saydam et al., 2011),
targeting the enlarged part of the nerve where tumor cells
were implanted. Volumetric changes in tumors were
tracked by in vivo bioluminescence imaging out to 18–19
weeks.

Histology

After treatment with vectors, the animals were killed with
isoﬂurane (3%) followed by decapitation. Sciatic nerves were
taken out and ﬁxed in 10% formalin for hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining (Messerli et al., 2002). The sciatic nerve
was removed; one-third of each of these biopsies was ﬁxed in
glutaraldehyde for Epon embedding, one-third was ﬁxed in
10% buffered formalin for parafﬁn embedding, and the re-
maining third was fresh-frozen at - 80°C for PCR analysis of
biodistribution of vector. Myelin integrity of sciatic nerves
injected with AAV1-P0-ICE vector was assessed in toluidine
blue-stained ultrathin sections prepared as follows: nerves
were placed into a modiﬁed Karnovsky ﬁxative (2.5% glu-
taraldehyde, 2.0% paraformaldehyde, and 0.025 calcium
chloride in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer), pH 7.4, and
ﬁxed overnight at 4°C. Further processing was done with a
Leica Lynx automatic tissue processor. Brieﬂy, the nerves
were postﬁxed in aqueous 1.3% osmium tetroxide, dehy-
drated in graded ethanol solutions, en bloc stained with 3.0%
uranyl acetate in the 70% ethanol step, inﬁltrated with epoxy
and propylene oxide mixtures, and embedded in pure epoxy.
The nerves were ﬂat embedded (to maintain orientation) and
allowed to polymerize overnight at 60°C. One-micron sec-
tions were cut with a DuPont-Sorvall MT-1 ultramicrotome
and glass knives. The sections were then stained on a warm
hotplate with a solution of 0.5% toluidine blue in 0.5% so-
dium borate, rinsed with water, dried, and coverslipped
(Eichler et al., 2009). The formalin-ﬁxed tissue was processed
and embedded in parafﬁn. Sections were stained with H&E
in accordance with routine protocols.

Behavioral analysis

The mice were tested by the von Frey method for pain/
mechanical sensitivity and by rotarod for gross motor func-
tion according to published methods (Agarwal et al., 2007;
Kirschbaum et al., 2009). Both nu/nu and C57BL/6 mice were
used for the behavioral experiments. One microliter (1013
GC/ml) of the vector AAV1-P0-ICE, 1 ll of AAV1-P0-GFP,
or 1 ll of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into
the sciatic nerve twice, with injections spaced 1 week apart
(n = 12 per group). All animals were allowed to habituate to
the behavioral apparatus for 1 week before testing for base-
line. Three baseline measurements on three separate days
preceded the ﬁrst injection. Mice were then tested the day
after each injection and twice per week for 8 weeks.

Mechanical sensitivity of the hind paw was measured by
determining withdrawal thresholds assessed with von Frey
ﬁlaments employed to determine mechanical sensitivity of
the plantar surface of both hind paws (only data for the hind
paw ipsilateral to the experimental schwannoma is shown).
A set of 20 von Frey ﬁlaments (North Coast Medical, Gilroy,
CA), generating bending forces ranging from 0.008 to
300 grams, were used. Mice were ‘‘rested’’ in the test cages
for 30 min before establishment of withdrawal threshold. All
tests were performed on the right (control) and left (injected)
hind paws. The middle plantar surface of the paw was
stimulated with a series of ascending force von Frey mono-
ﬁlaments. The 50% threshold for each paw withdrawal was
calculated, as previously described (Chen et al., 2009).

A rotating rod apparatus

Mice were placed on the elevated accelerating rod begin-
ning at 1 rpm/min for two trials per day twice per week.
Each trial lasted 3 min, during which time the rotating rod
underwent a linear acceleration from 1 to 40 rpm. Animals
were scored for their latency (in seconds) to fall in each
trial, and the average of two trials is reported. Animals
rested a minimum of 10 min between trials to avoid fatigue
(Chen et al., 2009).

Data analysis

All data are presented as group averages – SEM. The
baseline value for all tests before injection used the average
of all measurements before injection. Data were analyzed
with SPSS 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Repeated-measure anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) was used when data were col-
lected in multiple trials (Harris et al., 2012). p < 0.05 was
accepted as signiﬁcant.

Genomic DNA extraction and real-time PCR:
biodistribution

At necropsy, tissues were harvested, snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until genomic DNA was ex-
tracted. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from the spinal
cord, ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG),
and ipsilateral and contralateral sciatic nerves, using a
DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. gDNA concen-
trations were determined with a biophotometer (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany). AAV GCs in the gDNA were quanti-
ﬁed by real-time PCR with an ABI 7900 HT sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions, and results were
analyzed with the SDS 2.3 software. Brieﬂy, primer pairs and
probe were designed to the bovine growth hormone (BGH)
poly(A) region of the scAAV1-P0-GFP vector, using ABI
Primer Express software version 2.0. A standard curve was
created, using scAAV1-P0-GFP plasmid DNA containing the
BGH poly(A) region. The PCRs contained a total volume of
100 ll and were run under the following conditions: 50°C for
2 min, 95°C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and
60°C for 1 min.

DNA samples were assayed in triplicate. To control for
false negatives due to endogenous tissue-related PCR inhi-
bition, the third replicate was spiked with plasmid DNA at a
ratio of 100 copies/lg gDNA. If this replicate was greater
than 40 copies/lg gDNA then the results were considered
acceptable. If a sample contained ‡100 copies/lg gDNA it
was considered positive for vector genomes. If a sample
contained fewer than 100 copies/lg gDNA it was considered
negative for vector genomes. If less than 1 lg of gDNA was
analyzed, the vector copy number reported was normalized
per microgram of gDNA and the plasmid spike-in was re-
duced to maintain the ratio of 100 copies/lg gDNA.

Results

Effects of delivery of AAV1-P0-ICE vectors
to schwannomas

To assess the ability of AAV1 vectors to kill schwannoma
cells, we generated AAV1 vectors encoding ICE ( Juan et al.,
1996) or GFP under the control of the rat P0 promoter (shown

for AAV1-P0-ICE in Fig. 1). In initial evaluation, AAV1-CBA-
GFP, AAV1-P0-GFP, and AAV1-P0-ICE vectors were used to
infect human 293T cells and schwannoma HEI-193 cells. Using
the constitutive promoter, CBA, both cell types showed a high
degree of infectivity, that is, GFP-positive cells (Fig. 2A). When
the P0 promoter (Brown and Lemke, 1997) was used, expres-
sion of GFP was seen only in HEI-193 cells, and not in 293T
cells. Cell viability after infection with AAV1-P0-ICE and
AAV1-P0-GFP vectors (or no vector) was assessed by CellTiter-
Glo assay in 293T, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, and HEI-
193 cells. Infection with the AAV1-P0-ICE vector did not lead to
any death of 293T or SH-SY5Y cells, whereas more than 90% of
HEI-193 cells were dead by 72 hr postinfection (Fig. 2B). As an
added control, we used TaqMan real-time RT-PCR to evaluate
induction of the caspase-1 transgene after in vitro transduction
of cultured HEI-193 cells with pAAV-P0-ICE. There was a 161-
fold induction of caspase-1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1;
supplementary data are available online at www.liebertonline
.com/hum).

AAV1-P0-ICE causes regression of HEI-193FC
schwannomas

The therapeutic efﬁcacy of the AAV1-P0-ICE vector was
tested in a mouse model in which schwannomas are gen-
erated via implantation of HEI-193FC cells in the distal
region of the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Vector injections
were carried out according to two paradigms—early in
tumor growth and after establishment of schwannomas. The
AAV1-P0-GFP vector was used for the control group. Two
intratumoral injections of the AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-
GFP vector (1010 GC in 1 ll), spaced 1 week apart, at the site
of early HEI-193FC tumor formation prevented further
growth as assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging over
a 14-week period after vector injections (Fig. 3A); one-way
ANOVA revealing a signiﬁcant effect of AAV1-P0-ICE
treatment [F(1,11) = 6.04, p = 0.03]. In contrast, the majority of
tumors (ﬁve of six) injected with the AAV1-P0-GFP vector
continued to grow for the 9 weeks of postinjection evalua-
tion. When intratumoral injections of AAV1-P0-ICE were
carried out in larger, more established HEI-193FC tumors,
AAV1-P0-ICE injections caused essentially complete regres-
sion of these tumors out to 12 weeks after vector injections
[Fig. 3B; ANOVA: F(1,16) = 8.27, p = 0.01], whereas most of
the AAV1-P0-GFP-injected tumors (ﬁve of six) continued to
grow. In both panels of Fig. 3 the relatively large SEM in the

mone polyadenylation signal

FIG. 2. The P0 promoter is selectively expressed in schwannoma cells. (A) 293T cells and HEI-193 schwannoma cells were
infected with AAV1-CBA-GFP, AAV1-P0-GFP, or AAV1-P0-ICE vector in culture at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
10,000 GC/cell and, after 48 hr, were evaluated microscopically for GFP ﬂuorescence and cell morphology at an original
magniﬁcation of · 10. (B) Cell viability was assessed by Fluc bioluminescence in 293T, SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), and HEI-
193 cells 72 hr after infection with AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP, or no infection, at the same MOI as in (A). Values for each
cell line are normalized to viability of uninfected cells. *Signiﬁcant difference compared with the control group ( p = 0.00006).

AAV1-P0-GFP control group reﬂects the spontaneous tumor
regression in one of six animals in each group. To avoid bias
in our data, we used an intention-to-treat approach that in-
cluded data from all vector-injected animals for statistical
analysis.

Postmortem histological evaluation of

formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded sections stained with H&E was per-
formed on animals from both experiments shown in Fig. 3.

This revealed substantial tumor burden in nerves injected
with control AAV vector (AAV1-P0-EGFP) (Fig. 4A and B),
but only scant tumor cells in nerves injected with the AAV1-
P0-ICE vector at 11 weeks after vector injection (Fig. 4C and
D), as compared with normal nerve (Fig. 4E). Control ani-
mals implanted with HEI-193FC cells, but not injected with
vector, also demonstrated signiﬁcant tumor burden by H&E
staining at this time point (data not shown).

FIG. 3. Monitoring schwannoma volumes in vivo by bioluminescence imaging. Thirty thousand HEI-193FC cells were
implanted into the distal sciatic nerve of nude mice and tumor volume was monitored at weekly intervals by in vivo
bioluminescence imaging. At the time points indicated [arrows; weeks 4 and 5 (A) and weeks 5 and 6 (B)] after tumors were
established, they were injected twice (i.e., two separate injections 1 week apart) with either AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP
vector (1 · 1010 GC in 1 ll per injection). Graphs in (A) and (B) were obtained with different bioluminescence imaging
systems, and thus the luciferase signal (ordinate data) is different in scale. Data points are shown as mean values – SEM (n = 6
per group for each experiment). *Signiﬁcant difference (by post-hoc analysis) between AAV1-P0-ICE and control groups at
p < 0.002 (A) and p < 0.001 (B). In both (A) and (B), one in the control group out of six tumors regressed spontaneously, and all
animals were taken into consideration in data analysis.

AAV1-P0-ICE vector is not neurotoxic

Major concerns in using a vector encoding a proapoptotic
protein under a Schwann cell-speciﬁc promoter are the po-
tential toxicity to normal Schwann cells and consequent axo-
nal injury of neurons. Neuropathological evaluation of sciatic
nerve sections from nude mice collected 3 and 8 weeks after
two injections of the AAV1-P0-ICE vector (1010 GC in 1 ll,

1 week apart) into non-tumor-bearing sciatic nerves revealed
normal density of axons and no evidence of demyelination
(Fig. 5B and C), as compared with normal uninjected nerve
(Fig. 5A). Degenerating axons (Fig. 5B, inset) and macro-
phages (Fig. 5C, inset) were observed only rarely. H&E and
toluidine staining of myelin failed to reveal evidence of acute
or chronic inﬂammation (data not shown). Identical ﬁndings
were obtained with immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, that is,

there was no signiﬁcant neuropathology in AAV1-P0-ICE-
injected sciatic nerves (Fig. 5D and E).

Sensory/pain and motor function tests were used to assess
possible phenotypic alterations in C57BL/6 (immunocom-
petent) and nude (immunodeﬁcient) mice resulting from
intrasciatic nerve injections of AAV1-P0-ICE, AAV1-P0-GFP
(both vectors at 1010 GC in 1 ll, two injections 1 week apart),
or PBS (1 ll,
two injections 1 week apart). Mechanical
(‘‘pain’’) sensitivity (allodynia) was tested with von Frey
ﬁlaments to establish withdrawal threshold of the hind paw
ipsilateral to the injected sciatic nerve (Fig. 6A). Gross motor
performance was assayed by the accelerating rotarod test
(Fig. 6B). Although there was an expected temporary decrease
in the von Frey withdrawal threshold (i.e., mechanical hy-
peralgesia interpreted as a painlike behavior) after the surgical
manipulation required for injection, mechanical sensitivity did
not differ between the AAV1-P0-ICE, AAV1-P0-GFP, and PBS
groups over 5 weeks after injections, and the threshold for
all groups returned to preinjection baseline within 2 weeks
of vector injection. Thus, there was no sustained change in
sensory function associated with vector injection. Further,

there was no decrease in rotarod performance in any group at
any time during the study. The data in Fig. 6 were obtained
from C57BL/6 mice; statistically identical results were ob-
tained with nude mice (data not shown).

Biodistribution studies were carried out after injection of
AAV1-P0-ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP vector (1010 GC in 1 ll,
1 week apart) or PBS (1 ll, 1 week apart) into the sciatic nerve
of nude mice (n = 2 animals per group; AAV1-P0-ICE, AAV1-
P0-GFP, or PBS). Sciatic nerve and DRG, both ipsilateral and
contralateral to injection, as well as spinal cord were col-
lected 3 weeks later and evaluated for the presence of vector
by qPCR. Vector was found in the sciatic nerve and DRG in
all samples ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to vector injec-
tions, as well as in all spinal cord samples (Table 1). Al-
though vector was detectable in the DRG and spinal cord,
immunohistological analysis of these tissues 8 weeks after a
series of two intrasciatic AAV1-P0-GFP injections into adult
mice (same method as described previously) failed to reveal
any GFP ﬂuorescence, suggesting that protein expression in
these tissues is negligible (data not shown).

The observed absence of AAV-P0-ICE mediated neuronal
and Schwann cell toxicity can be accounted for by P0 control
of transgene expression. We hypothesized that the relatively
low expression of P0 in the Schwann cells of adult mice
would limit transgene expression after intrasciatic injection
of our AAV vectors. P0 promoter expression in Schwann
cells is greater in young than in adult mice, with expression
peaking at 1 month of age and decreasing to about 50% of
peak by 2 months (Shen et al., 2011). Further, neurotoxicity
would not be expected to occur because the P0 promoter is
not expressed in neurons (Prabhakar et al., 2010).

To test this hypothesis, we injected the sciatic nerves of
young (postnatal day 21 [P21]) and adult (14-week-old) im-
mune-competent C57BL/6 mice with AAV1-P0-GFP and
collected sciatic nerves and DRG 10 days later for histological
analysis of GFP expression (Fig. 7A, top four panels; and Fig.
7B, top two panels). In the sciatic nerve there was greater
GFP expression after AAV1-P0-GFP injection in P21 mice
compared with 14-week-old animals, consistent with lower
P0 expression in adult mice. In DRG, there was no detectable
GFP expression in either young or adult mice after AAV1-P0-
GFP injection (Fig. 7B, top panels), consistent with constitu-
tively low P0 expression in neurons. These results suggest
that use of the P0 promoter in the AAV1-P0-ICE vector limits
expression in Schwann cells and neurons after vector injec-
tion into the sciatic nerve of adult animals. This may explain
the lack of observed vector-associated toxicity.

To further validate our results, we compared GFP expression
after intrasciatic injection of AAV-P0-GFP with injection of
AAV1-CBA-GFP. The CBA promoter is ubiquitously expressed
(Gray et al., 2011). We found greater GFP expression when

under CBA promoter control compared with P0 in both sciatic
nerve (Fig. 7A) and DRG (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, we also found
some indication that there was greater GFP expression in the
sciatic nerve of young mice compared with adult mice after
AAV1-CBA-GFP injection, suggesting that myelination, which
is incomplete in young but complete in adult mice, may protect
against adenoviral vector infection (Fig. 7A). However, given
the high level of GFP transgene expression in both young and
adult mice when GFP is under CBA control, we conclude that
use of the P0 promoter is more important than degree of
myelination in protection from AAV1-P0-ICE toxicity.

Proximal sciatic nerve implantation of schwannoma
cells leads to painlike behavior that is relieved
by AAV1-P0-ICE treatment

As persistent pain can be a major clinical issue in patients
with schwannomatosis and NF2, and HEI-193FC tumors
implanted in the distal sciatic nerve of mice did not produce
painlike behavior (i.e., no decreased von Frey threshold), we
endeavored to generate an experimental schwannoma model
that would mimic clinical schwannoma-related pain. We
hypothesized that more proximal implantation of HEI-193FC
cells would lead to mechanical sensitization due to nerve
compression, because in the proximal sciatic nerve expansion
of tumors is limited by pelvic structures. As shown in Fig. 8,
growth of proximal schwannomas was associated with a
signiﬁcant decrease in the von Frey threshold in the hind
paw ipsilateral to tumor site starting at 3 weeks post-
implantation. This mechanical sensitization persisted until
approximately 3 weeks after initial AAV1-P0-ICE injection.
As is evident in Fig. 8, AAV1-P0-ICE injection led to a sta-
tistically signiﬁcant regression of tumors [one-way ANOVA:
F(8,54) = 2.80, p = 0.01] and an associated return of von Frey
threshold values to baseline (i.e., normalization of pain

sensitivity) as indicated by one-way ANOVA [F(19,120) = 7.8,
p < 0.0001].

Discussion

We have validated a treatment strategy for schwannomas
in which an AAV vector delivers an apoptotic protein, ICE,
under the control of the Schwann-cell speciﬁc promoter P0,
causing selective death of tumor cells. Using a xenograft
model in which human NF2 schwannoma tumors form in
the distal sciatic nerve of nude mice, we both prevented
development of early schwannomas and caused regression
of well-established tumors with minimal to no nerve damage
through direct intratumoral injection of this AAV1-P0-ICE
vector. In a related paradigm devised to model tumor-
associated pain, the same human schwannoma cells were
implanted more proximally in the sciatic nerve of mice with
tumor development leading to mechanical hypersensitivity
(i.e., pain behavior). Treatment of these tumors with AAV1-
P0-ICE resulted in concurrent tumor regression and nor-
malization of mechanical sensitivity. We have also shown
that injection of the AAV1-P0-ICE vector into the sciatic
nerve of both nude (nonimmune-competent) and immune-
competent mice is not associated with any apparent neuro-
pathology as indicated by histological evaluation and
behavioral testing.

Several aspects of this study were surprising. The ﬁrst was
the selective killing of schwannoma cells by AAV1-P0-ICE
while leaving resident Schwann cells (and neuronal axons)
intact.
ICE was the ﬁrst mammalian caspase identiﬁed
(Miura et al., 1993) and expression causes rapid lysis of cells
associated with inﬂammatory activity (Miao et al., 2011). In
some models ICE expression has been associated with
neurodegeneration (Friedlander, 2000) and demyelination
(Furlan et al., 1999). However, extensive evaluation of

FIG. 8. Effect of AAV1-P0-ICE-mediated tumor regression on pain behaviors in proximally implanted sciatic nerve HEI-
193FC schwannomas. Sixty thousand HEI-193FC cells were implanted into the sciatic nerve, at the level of the pelvis, in nude
mice and tumor-associated bioluminescence was monitored at weekly intervals by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Eight
weeks after tumor implantation, at a time when painlike nocifensive behavior (i.e., decreased von Frey threshold in the
plantar surface in foot ipsilateral to tumor) was well established, tumors were injected twice, 1 week apart, with AAV1-P0-
ICE or AAV1-P0-GFP vector (1 · 1010 GC in 1 ll per injection). Arrows indicate times of vector injection. The solid line shows
the von Frey threshold and the dotted line shows total ﬂux, the former a measure of mechanical sensitivity and the latter a
measure of tumor volume. As evident in the graph, AAV1-P0-ICE-mediated tumor regression is correlated with a return of
the von Frey threshold to normal baseline. *Signiﬁcantly different (p < 0.05) from preimplantation baseline for von Frey
threshold; #signiﬁcantly different ( p < 0.05) from maximal total ﬂux corresponding to tumor volume.

peripheral nerve integrity and function, including neuro-
pathology, nerve conduction velocity, and behavior (pain
sensitization and rotarod performance), revealed minimal
to no damage after direct injection of AAV1-P0-mICE into
the sciatic nerve (present study) (Prabhakar et al., 2010).

Protection of normal nerve may be attributed to the use of
the P0 promoter, which normally regulates expression of a
major myelin glycoprotein that is at its highest levels in
Schwann cells during myelination, occurring at 1 month of
age during normal development (Lee et al., 1997; Shen et al.,
2011). Expression of P0 decreases by about 50% at 2 months
of age (Shen et al., 2011)—the time of vector injection in our
studies. Accordingly, our results indicate decreased GFP
expression in the sciatic nerve when AAV-P0-GFP was in-
jected into the nerve of 2-month-old mice compared with P21
mice. This decrease in transgene expression in older mice
after AAV-CBA-GFP injection raises the possibility that de-
gree of Schwann cell myelination reduces vector infectivity.
A second surprising ﬁnding was the extensive remission
of tumors after injection of the AAV1-P0-ICE vector (two
intratumoral injections of 1010 GC vector in 1 ll). On the basis
of other tumor injection studies it is unlikely that all the
tumor cells were infected with the vector, albeit infection
efﬁciency varies with serotype and tumor type (Teschendorf
et al., 2010). Although we estimate, based on the rate of
growth as monitored by bioluminescence imaging (Saydam
et al., 2011), that the MOI of tumor cells was about 3000 GC/
cell,
the vector inoculum dispersed
uniformly throughout the tumor. The high extent of tumor

is unlikely that

it

killing observed may be explained by the ﬁnding that ICE
can be delivered from one cell to another via microvesicles,
resulting in death of recipient cells (Sarkar et al., 2009),
and the likelihood that schwannoma cells, like other tumor
cells, are highly active in microvesicle release (Taylor and
Gercel-Taylor, 2008; Balaj et al., 2011). The myelin sheath
on Schwann cells may also block uptake of microvesicles. A
third surprising ﬁnding was that we saw little to no sign of
macrophage cell invasion into the nerve after AAV1-P0-ICE
injection in nude and immune-competent mice, considering
that ICE is a central component of the inﬂammasome com-
plex (Lamkanﬁ and Dixit, 2009). It remains possible that
some macrophages moved in and out quickly after AAV1-
P0-ICE vector injection and were no longer present at the
earliest time point we evaluated (3 weeks after the second of
two vector injections).

Complete assessment of our AAV-P0-ICE therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of schwannoma requires testing in
immune-competent animals. We expect that in immune-
competent mice we will observe a stronger inﬂammatory
response compared with nude mice, and this may lead to
greater neurotoxicity. However, AAV-P0-ICE tumor treat-
ment in immune-competent mice also has the potential to
establish both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. If
the latter host immune responses do occur, AAV-P0-ICE
treatment of a single lesion may lead to systemic changes
that cause regression of distal NF2 lesions and vaccinate
animals from the development of tumors after implantation
at a later time. This is a crucial issue in the treatment of

AAV-CASPASE-1 REGRESSION OF SCHWANNOMAS

patients with NF2 given the typical presence of multiple le-
sions in a given individual and the development of tumors
over long time periods. We are currently testing this, using
the NF2S-1 mouse schwannoma line (Prabhakar et al., 2007)
implanted in the sciatic nerve of Swiss mice.

Current therapy for NF2 and schwannomatosis tumors
involves surgical resection or radiosurgery of symptomatic
lesions and symptomatic management of pain. There are
several signiﬁcant limitations to these available treatments.
The location of tumors can make surgical resection infeasible
because of the unacceptable risk of morbidity (e.g., lesioning
of cervical nerve roots) or mortality (e.g., damage to the
brainstem). Even when resection is possible, signiﬁcant
morbidity may be associated with the operation. Further,
schwannomas—especially in schwannomatosis—can be as-
sociated with excruciating, persistent pain for which surgical
resection may not be an option because of the number of
tumors. Even if it is assumed that not all tumor cells would
be destroyed by the vector, because schwannomas are slow
growing and benign, a reduction in tumor mass would be
expected to confer meaningful and prolonged symptomatic
improvement.

These preclinical studies provide support for further
progression toward phase 1 clinical trial evaluation of the
AAV-P0-ICE vector for the treatment of schwannomas.
AAV vectors have been shown to be safe for use in the
human nervous system in a number of gene therapy trials
( McPhee et al., 2006; Kaplitt et al., 2007; Eberling et al.,
2008; Worgall et al., 2008; Bowers et al., 2011; McCown,
2011; Lentz et al., 2012). These vectors have also proven
effective in treating malignant tumors in preclinical trials,
although tumor cells that survive the initial
infection
continue to divide and thus lose AAV-delivered trans-
genes ( Meijer et al., 2009; Maitituoheti et al., 2011; Tamai
et al., 2012). Further, conditional expression of another
caspase, caspase-9, has proven safe and effective in pre-
venting graft-versus-host disease in patients with leuke-
mia treated with genetically modiﬁed T cells in clinical
trials (Di Stasi et al., 2011).

Our preclinical ﬁndings in an orthotopic mouse model
demonstrate the efﬁcacy and safety of
treatment of
schwannomas with an AAV1-P0-ICE vector. These studies
will help form the basis of translational studies in support of
transition to phase 1 human trials. The use of AAV1-P0-ICE
vectors for the treatment of neuroﬁbromatosis holds the
promise of preventing and reversing the substantial dis-
ability and suffering associated with schwannomatosis and
NF2 tumors. This approach, in which the mass of a benign
tumor is reduced by injection of a vector that induces se-
lective apoptosis via a cell-speciﬁc promoter, should have
wide application for a variety of benign tumors, including
adenomas, ﬁbromas, hemangiomas, lipomas, meningiomas,
myomas, moles (nevi), neuromas, osteochondromas, and
papillomas—pending selective promoter identiﬁcation. This
would reduce the need for surgical resection, which is in-
vasive and can have substantial associated morbidity. On the
basis of the ease of vector injection as compared with sur-
gery, we anticipate that vector treatment would be more
frequently sought out by patients, thereby potentially im-
proving prognosis (through early treatment), as many of
these benign tumors undergo malignant transformation over
time.
