Abstract Vestibular schwannoma is a benign neoplasm
arising from the Schwann cell sheath of the auditory-
vestibular nerve. It most commonly affects both sides in
the genetic condition Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2, causing
progressive high frequency sensorineural hearing loss.
Here, we describe a microsurgical technique and stereo-
tactic coordinates for schwannoma cell grafting in the
vestibular nerve region that

growth in the cerebellopontine angle and inner auditory
canal with resulting hearing loss. Tumor growth was
monitored by bioluminescence and MRI in vivo imaging,
and hearing assessed by auditory brainstem responses.
These techniques, by potentially enabling orthotopic
grafting of a variety of cell lines will allow studies on the
pathogenesis of tumor-related hearing loss and preclinical
drug evaluation, including hearing endpoints, for NF2-re-
lated and sporadic schwannomas.

Introduction

Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are intracranial, extra-axial
tumors that arise from the Schwann cell sheath of the 8th
cranial nerve. As VS increase in size,
they eventually
occupy a large portion of the cerebellopontine angle. Over
3300 vestibular schwannomas are diagnosed per year in the
US and incidence is 1.09 per 100,000 population [1]. The
great majority of VS are sporadic unilateral, which usually
develop between ages 40 and 60. About 5 % of VS are
bilateral and occur in neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2), an
autosomal dominant genetic disease [2]. The NF2 tumor
suppressor gene [3, 4], is inactivated in both NF2-associ-
ated and sporadic VS [5, 6]. At presentation, more than
90 % of NF2 patients demonstrate some change in hearing
on the side of a VS [7], with the usual audiogram
describing a high-frequency slope in more than 60 %
[7, 8].

The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still
unclear and are supposed to be multifactorial [9, 10].
Tumor size and increase in tumor volume are not correlated
to hearing status [7, 9, 11], but multiple changes affecting
the cochlea correlate with hearing level in these patients
[12, 13]. It was also suggested that differences in the course
of hearing might result from genetic determinants intrinsic
to the tumor [14].

Increased interest in developing new strategies for the
treatment of VS, in particular for those occurring in the
context of NF2, results in an increasing requirement for
accurate mouse models recapitulating the tumor natural
history of the human condition [15]. Moreover, the use of

anti-angiogenic drug therapy has suggested a beneﬁcial
effect on hearing, an endpoint that is overlooked in the
preclinical ﬁeld [16]. Thus, a better understanding of the
process underlying hearing loss requires speciﬁc models.
Although accurately reproducing some of the manifesta-
tions of NF2, genetically engineered mouse models (GEM)
are time and resources consuming, therefore best suited in
validating promising therapies
than for high
throughput drug screening [15]. As an alternative, ortho-
topic grafting techniques can be used to recapitulate bio-
logically relevant
tumor growth and microenvironment
[17]. Here, we describe a new in vivo modeling approach
for VS based on orthotopic grafting of NF2-deﬁcient
Schwann cells in the auditory-vestibular nerve complex
region. By growing in the cerebellopontine angle and inner
auditory canal, these tumors reproduce some of the features
of human VS, including progressive hearing loss, providing
a new functional endpoint for high throughput preclinical
NF2 drug screening.

Material and methods

Cell line

The SC4 Schwann cell line was derived from adeno-Cre-
infected, spontaneously transformed Schwann cells iso-
lated from adult Nf2KO3/ﬂox2 mouse sciatic nerve in the
FVB/N background [18–21]. SC4 cells were transfected
with a plasmid encoding a fusion EGFP-luciferase gene
under the control of the CMV promoter, and stable cell
clones were selected using cell sorting. The clone SC4-9luc
used for these studies was serially passaged in vitro.

Mice

Athymic immunodeﬁcient NU-Foxn1nu (NU/NU) mice in
an outbred BALB/C background were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories. All animal care and experi-
mentation reported here were conducted in compliance
with the guidelines and with the speciﬁc approval of
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under pro-
tocol numbers HEI1175-08-03 and CHLA315-12.

Microsurgery approach to the cerebellopontine
angle to access the auditory-vestibular nerve
complex

Following anesthesia by intraperitoneal administration of
xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine-HCl (100 mg/kg), the
left post-auricular region was shaved and cleaned for sur-
gical approach. Under the operating microscope, after a
semi-circular incision was made extending from the vertex

123

to the neck, an auricular ﬂap was elevated anteriorly to give
access to the lateral skull base including the petrous bone
and occipital bone. Nuchal muscles were elevated and the
sterno-cleido-mastoidian insertions separated from the lat-
eral aspect of the petrous bone. The facial nerve was then
identiﬁed as it exited the skull base. To avoid bleeding, the
exposed bone was cauterized. Identiﬁcation of the lateral
and posterior semicircular canals and root of the zygoma
anteriorly deﬁned the drilling area (Fig. 1a–c). A 0.6 mm
diamond was used to drill the bone overlying the dura
mater covering the ﬂocculus of the cerebellum. A maximal
exposure was obtained by lining both semi-circular canal
and the lateral sinus, the dura was opened and the ﬂocculus
retracted posterior-superiorly allowing access to the cere-
bellopontine angle. The arachnoidal layer of the cysterna
pontis would eventually open spontaneously or it was
punctured using a sharp hook, the cerebrospinal ﬂuid was
then allowed to drain. Transparency of the ampullae, sit-
uated close to the nerve, allowed targeting the auditory-
vestibular nerve complex at the porus for injection. The
craniotomy was then occluded using bone wax for a
waterproof closure. The total
surgery duration was
approximately 25 min.

Stereotactic approach to the auditory-vestibular
nerve complex

Stereotaxic coordinates in 8-week-old NU/NU mice were
established in a preliminary trial by injecting India ink
through the cannulas followed by a postmortem histologi-
cal examination.

The stereotactic device (Stoelting Lab standard rat
(#51600) with mouse adapter
stereotaxic instrument
the inner
(#51624)) was calibrated to precisely target
auditory canal in the area of the vestibular ganglion, next to
the auditory-vestibular nerve complex, and identiﬁed and
validated speciﬁc coordinates: 4.91 mm cranio-caudal
from the bregma, 2.1 mm lateral from the midline and
5.6 mm in depth from the surface of the skull.

Injection procedure

The injection method developed in this protocol was
modiﬁed from Wu et al. 2005 [22]. SC4-9luc cells were
suspended in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (D-
MEM, Life Technologies) containing 10 % FBS at a con-
centration of 4.16 9 105/ll allowing injection of 5 9 104
cells in 120 nl. Following microsurgery or stereotactic
approach, the cell suspension (or the cell-free medium for
sham injections) was infused gradually in the left auditory-
vestibular nerve complex at a rate of 1 nl/s (UMPIII
micropump, Micro 4 microprocessor, World Precision
Instruments) using the Intra Ocular Injection Kit (World

ﬂocculus (Fl, dashed gray line) in the proximity of the extracranial
facial nerve (FN, dashed black line) was drilled and the ﬂocculus
retracted postero-superiorly allowing access to the cysterna pontis.
c The ampulla of the lateral semi-circular canal maps the entry of the

Bioluminescence imaging

The growth of SC4-9luc orthotopic allografts was moni-
tored by bioluminescence imaging using the IVIS imaging

system (Caliper, PerkinElmer). All images were obtained
12 min after intraperitoneal injection of ﬁreﬂy luciferin
(I.P., 225 mg/kg, Caliper) within a 60-180 s time acquisi-
tion. Mice were sedated continuously via inhalation of

matrix and 2.56 cm ﬁeld of view. After scanning, if nee-
ded, mice were gently warmed on a thermostatically con-
trolled heating pad until awake enough to be returned to
their home cage. MRI images were reconstructed at native
resolution. For each mouse, we acquired 22 axial images
with 0.4 mm thick slices and 0.02 mm gap between slices.
This produced 0.1 9 0.1 mm2 per pixel in-plane resolution
with an effective slice thickness of 0.42 mm. eFilm
Workstation 1.8.1 (eFilm Medical
Inc.) was used to
transfer reconstructed images into DICOM ﬁles. The vol-
ume of the tumors were measured by manual segmentation
using the OsiriX image analysis software [23].

Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) for objective
assessment of auditory thresholds in mice

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration
of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine-HCl (100 mg/kg).
During ABR measurement, body temperature was kept at
38 °C with a heating pad. Stainless steel needle electrodes
were placed on the vertex and below the ipsilateral ear,
with ground electrode on the body of the anesthetized
mice. Impedance was checked (below 5 kX) after posi-
tioning the set of electrodes. Tone-pips were elicited
ranging from 4 to 32 kHz to obtain frequency speciﬁc
information. Multiple repetitions of stimuli (300) were
yield to obtain an averaged waveform. The recorded sig-
nals were bandpass ﬁltered (300 to 3000 Hz) and ampliﬁed
with a differential ampliﬁer (105 lV). ABRs were recor-
ded and reviewed with BioSig software (Tucker Davis
Technologies). The threshold was deﬁned as the lowest
level at which waves of the ABR could be clearly detected
by visual inspection. All thirty age matched mice in the
surgery experimental group were tested following the same
protocol on both ears. Testing was set at 7 weeks of age for
baseline (before surgery) and 2, 14, and 21 days after
surgery. Twenty ears of 10 non-injected control mice were

Histopathology

Whole mouse heads were dissected and skull ﬁxed in 4 %
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h, then decalciﬁed for 24 h
(RapidCal-ImmunoTM, BBC biochemical corporation) and
embedded in parafﬁn. Each specimen was sectioned at
3.5 lm thickness and stained with standard H&E as pre-
viously described [24].

Data analysis

For measurements, data are expressed as mean ± SEM. For
statistical comparison at the end-point we used a Student t test
with the level of signiﬁcance set at p \ 0.05 (two-tailed).
Statistical calculations were done using GraphPad, Prism 5.0a.
The correlation between tumor size and the average radiance
in photon/sr/cm2 was evaluated using a linear regression.

Results

Microsurgical approach to the auditory-vestibular
nerve complex

For the cell-derived allograft in this study we chose the
SC4 cell line that has become a standard in NF2 basic and
preclinical research [21, 25, 26]. SC4 cells were labeled
with luciferase so that in vivo bioluminescence imaging
could be applied to longitudinally monitor orthotopic
tumor growth across the study. A microsurgical approach
was utilized to graft SC4-9luc cells in the region of the
auditory-vestibular (8th) nerve complex in the cerebello-
pontine angle. Thirty NU/NU mice were divided in three
groups: the allograft group was injected with the SC4-9luc
cell suspension, the sham surgery group that received the
same volume of the cell-free medium as the allograft
group, and the control group with no surgery. No death was
recorded during or directly after surgery. In the SC4-9luc
cell-injected group all mice developed a tumor. After
recovering from surgery, mice progressively lost weight
and reached a clinical endpoint requiring euthanasia 20 days
after surgery (Fig. 1d). The median survival was 25 days in
the allograft group. Survival was not affected by sham
injection compared to the control group with no surgery
(Fig. 1e). To monitor the kinetic of tumor growth, biolumi-
nescence imaging (BLI) and MRI (Fig. 1f–g) were sequen-
tially acquired. We found that tumor bearing mice could be
readily identiﬁed using both methods (Fig. 3a, b), however

we noticed a discrepancy between BLI signal and MR
measurements of tumor size. Although BLI can detect tumor
growth early after implantation (tumor volume\5 mm3), in
mice with larger tumors ([5 mm3), increasing MR volumes
did not correlate with average emitted radiance that tended to
plateau. A similar effect, with in vivo BLI signal plateauing
in large tumors, has been observed previously and is gener-
ally attributed to development of hemorrhage and necrosis
within the tumor bed [27, 28].

Stereotactic approach to the auditory-vestibular
nerve complex

As an alternative to microsurgery, we developed a stereo-
tactic approach to reduce operator-induced variables and

accurately reproduce the site of grafting. Twenty NU/NU
mice were divided in two groups and operated using this
approach. One group received the SC4-9luc cell suspen-
sion, the other group was sham injected with the same
volume of cell-free medium. No death was recorded sec-
ondary to the injection. Tumor growth was monitored twice
a week using thin cut MRI to determine tumor onset and
growth characteristics. In the group of mice injected with
the SC4-9luc cell suspension, 8 of 10 mice monitored by
MRI developed a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve extending
in the inner auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle,
thereby closely mimicking the human condition (Fig. 2).

mice developed clinical signs indicative of a moribund
condition requiring euthanasia. The average tumor growth
rate from day 11 to day 21 was 0.28 mm3/day (Fig. 3c). In
all analyzed cases, the main causes of death were the
extension of the tumor into the otic capsule and compres-
sion of neighboring structures by tumor expansion. Control
mice in the sham injected group did not show reduced
survival.

Monitoring the effect of SC4-9luc tumor growth
on auditory function in NU/NU mice

Consistent hearing levels were observed across 7-week-
old NU/NU mice tested before any surgical procedure
(n = 30, 60 ears total), with no signiﬁcant intra-individual
differences (Fig. 4a). Two days after surgery a general
worsening of hearing in both sham- and cell-injected mice
was recorded, with an increase in thresholds prevailing on
the low frequencies (4 and 8 kHz) (Fig. 4b) suggesting a
pressure mechanism secondary to CSF depletion. Hearing
recovery in the sham-injected group occurred progres-
sively up to day 14 after surgery when thresholds matched
those of the non-injected control group (Fig. 4c). How-
ever, in the cell-injected mice a increased threshold at
16 kHz was observed and low-frequency hearing loss did
not revert
to the levels observed in non-injected, and
sham-injected mice. This difference was statistically sig-
niﬁcant and increased at day 21 (t test, p \ 0.05, n = 10
each group)
Interestingly, between 8 and
11 weeks of age, the non-injected control NU/NU mice

showed early progressive high-frequency hearing loss
(24 kHz, Fig. 4b–d), suggestive of early presbicusis in
this mouse strain. In conclusion, in the NU/NU;SC4-9luc
allograft model, the 16 kHz frequency appeared to be the
most reliable measurement since it demonstrated speciﬁc
and signiﬁcant progressive hearing loss from day 2 to day
21 after surgery in the allografted mice and was neither
affected by aging (at least up to 11 weeks of age), nor by
surgery.

Discussion

Since Lee et al. introduced in 1992 the possibility of grafting
fresh human vestibular schwannoma specimens in nude mice
while maintaining survival and growth in a speciﬁc tissue
environment, little progress has been made to enable the use
of such models to further study schwannoma biology [29]. In
fact, only few other publications used xenografts of fresh
human specimens as models for schwannoma growth [30–
32].
Interestingly, Neff et al. proposed a stereotactic
approach to graft freshly isolated schwannoma cells into the
caudate nucleus of NOD/SCID mice followed by in vivo BLI
[33]. Although not reproducing the original location of
vestibular schwannoma, this approach eventually provided
information on the impact of blood brain barrier. Neverthe-
less, a low grafting rate and absence of discrete tumor growth
limit its use.

Our study was designed to provide a proof of principle
for grafting schwannoma cells in the acoustico-facial nerve

complex region, using the SC4-9 cell
line. SC4-9 has
become a standard model in NF2 research since it reca-
pitulates signalling network signatures of human and
mouse NF2 schwannomas [19, 21, 25, 26], with high
grafting efﬁciency when orthotopically injected into the
sciatic nerves of immunodeﬁcient NU/NU mice [34]. We

found that the microsurgical approach successfully targeted
the anatomic location where human VS predominantly
arise and tumor development could be monitored by
in vivo imaging. We also showed that by using carefully
identiﬁed stereotactic coordinates, precise targeting of the
auditory-vestibular complex region can be achieved, thus

relevant in the context of using mouse and human VS
allograft models for high throughput drug evaluation and to
inform trial design in more sophisticated GEM NF2 mod-
els. In vivo imaging and histological analysis showed that
SC4-9 tumors developed in the cerebello-pontine region
with similar extensions as human VS. These included
intracochlear
localization and brainstem compression
eventually causing death. The use of other mouse and
human cellular models, including slow-growing primary
VS cells, will eventually mimick the benign,
indolent
nature of human VS. For each new VS cell model grafted
in vivo using this approach, the natural history of allograft
tumor development can be analyzed by MRI. This will
deﬁne the cell line-speciﬁc time frame in which tumor
growth is limited to the anatomical region of interest,
making new models suitable for preclinical drug testing
using tumor volume and hearing as endpoints.

One of the limitations of this model is that the transient
hearing loss observed in both the surgical and non-surgical
(contralateral) ears was likely due to the surgical technique,
which requires opening of the arachnoidal layer at the level
of the cerebellopontine angle to deplete cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) from cysterna pontis and/or magna. The effect of
changes in the CSF pressure on hearing has been widely
documented in clinical reports [35–37]. More precisely, in
humans, hearing loss affects preferentially low frequencies
(125–500 Hz) and high frequencies
(4000–8000 Hz),
whereas medium frequencies (2000 Hz) are well respected.
The lower frequencies tend to take more time to recover.
Subsequently, this early shift was reproduced in animal
models with depletion of perilymphatic ﬂuids or CSF [38].
The rapid tumor growth with intra-cochlear extension is
likely the primary cause of hearing loss in the SC4-9
model. Intracochlear extension has been described for
human VS, although its prevalence among NF2 patient is
yet to be determined [39, 40]. Use of VS cell lines with
different growth patterns might become relevant to dissect
other causes of hearing loss in these patients, in addition to
tumor compression of the acoustic nerve.

The most

frequent hearing ﬁnding in pure tone
audiometry for VS in humans is a high frequency sen-
sorineural hearing loss [7, 8, 41]. Animal models cannot
precisely recapitulate hearing loss in humans since other
mammalians do not share our unique auditory sensitivity
[42]. In this study we used tone pips for frequency-speciﬁc
testing within the mouse auditory spectrum. We observed a
speciﬁc threshold increase at 16 kHz consistent with the
increased thresholds in the higher frequencies observed in
the human condition. Because of the early occurrence of
presbycusis in this mouse strain, the effect of tumor growth
on higher frequencies could not be determined. Use of

123

genetic backgrounds of immunodeﬁcient mice with dif-
ferent hearing characteristics could help address this issue.
The report of a favorable impact of an anti-angiogenic
treatment on hearing in NF2 VS patients compels the need
to understand the relationship between VS growth and
hearing loss [16]. As a result, hearing outcome during
treatment has became the primary endpoint for clinical
trials investigating antiangiogenic compounds such as
bevacizumab. Thus, the inclusion of a hearing endpoint in
VS preclinical trials using a varity of cellular models will
contribute to the characterization of compound efﬁcacy and
prioritization.
