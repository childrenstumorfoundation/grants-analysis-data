BACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong genetic con-
tribution to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Current guidelines for
clinical genetic testing recommend a G-banded karyotype to detect
chromosomal abnormalities and fragile X DNA testing, but guidelines
for chromosomal microarray analysis have not been established.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 933 patients received clinical
genetic testing for a diagnosis of ASD between January 2006 and De-
cember 2008. Clinical genetic testing included G-banded karyotype,
fragile X testing, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) to test for sub-
microscopic genomic deletions and duplications. Diagnostic yield of
clinically signiﬁcant genetic changes was compared.
RESULTS: Karyotype yielded abnormal results in 19 of 852 patients
(2.23% [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.73%–2.73%]), fragile X testing
was abnormal in 4 of 861 (0.46% [95% CI: 0.36%– 0.56%]), and CMA
identiﬁed deletions or duplications in 154 of 848 patients (18.2% [95%
CI: 14.76%–21.64%]). CMA results for 59 of 848 patients (7.0% [95% CI:
5.5%– 8.5%]) were considered abnormal, which includes variants as-
sociated with known genomic disorders or variants of possible signif-
icance. CMA results were normal in 10 of 852 patients (1.2%) with
abnormal karyotype due to balanced rearrangements or unidentiﬁed
marker chromosome. CMA with whole-genome coverage and CMA with
targeted genomic regions detected clinically relevant copy-number
changes in 7.3% (51 of 697) and 5.3% (8 of 151) of patients, respectively,
both higher than karyotype. With the exception of recurrent deletion
and duplication of chromosome 16p11.2 and 15q13.2q13.3, most copy-
number changes were unique or identiﬁed in only a small subset of
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CMA had the highest detection rate among clinically
available genetic tests for patients with ASD. Interpretation of microar-
ray data is complicated by the presence of both novel and recurrent
copy-number variants of unknown signiﬁcance. Despite these limita-
tions, CMA should be considered as part of the initial diagnostic eval-
uation of patients with ASD. Pediatrics 2010;125:e727–e735

Autism is a complex neurobehavioral
disorder that includes impairments in
social interaction, developmental lan-
guage and communication deﬁcits,
and rigid, repetitive behaviors. The Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Re-
vision (DSM-IV-TR) category of perva-
sive developmental disorders includes
autistic disorder, pervasive develop-
mental disorder-not otherwise speci-
ﬁed (PDD-NOS), Asperger disorder,
childhood disintegrative disorder, and
Rett disorder. These diagnoses are
also collectively known as autism
spectrum disorders (ASDs). ASD oc-
curs in all racial, ethnic, and social
groups. The prevalence of autistic dis-
order is ⬃1 per 1000, and the preva-
lence of ASD is ⬃6 per 1000, affecting
many more males than females.1
Genetic factors increase the risk of de-
veloping ASD,2 but the speciﬁc genetic
cause for an individual patient can be
elusive. Autism may be a component of
genetic syndromes with distinct clini-
cal features, as in tuberous sclerosis
and Rett disorder. Other syndromes
are not easily recognized in young chil-
dren, as in fragile X syndrome, which
accounts for ⬃2% of ASD cases.3 Most
children with ASD do not have dysmor-
phic features or other medical prob-
lems associated with a recognizable
genetic syndrome, and genetic testing
is crucial to identifying a cause for ASD
in this population.
G-banded karyotyping for chromo-
somal abnormalities and fragile X test-
ing are currently recommended as
ﬁrst-tier genetic tests, and are abnor-
mal in up to 5% of patients.3,4 Karyotyp-
ing will not detect submicroscopic
genomic deletions and duplications or
copy-number variants (CNVs) smaller
than ⬃5 megabases (Mb). Subtelo-
meric ﬂuorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion (ST-FISH) can detect submicro-
scopic CNVs in patients with mental
retardation (MR), but authors of the

largest study of ST-FISH found patho-
genic changes in only 2.6% of 11 688
unselected cases of MR,5 and no
changes were found by ST-FISH in 1
small study of patients with ASD.6
Array comparative genomic hybrid-
ization (array CGH) also called chro-
mosomal microarray analysis (CMA),
detects clinically signiﬁcant CNVs in
at least 10% of patients with a variety
of developmental problems such as
developmental delay, MR, and multi-
congenital anomalies.7–9 Re-
ple
search studies for patients with ASD
suggest a similar detection rate of
⬃10% using CMA,10–12 but the diag-
nostic yield in large clinical cohorts
has not been well studied. We
present here clinical genetic test re-
sults,
including those from karyo-
type, fragile X testing, and CMA, and
discuss the implications for clinical
care for a large cohort of patients
with ASD.

METHODS

We evaluated a combined cohort of 933
patients (755 males and 178 females
[ratio: 4.24:1]) (Table 1). Autistic disor-
der (n ⫽ 447) and PDD-NOS (n ⫽ 454)
were the predominant diagnoses. A to-
tal of 461 patients, aged 13 months to
15 years and clinically diagnosed with
ASD, were recruited through the Au-
tism Consortium (AC), a research and

clinical collaboration that included 5
Boston-area medical centers (see “Ac-
knowledgments”). Protocols and con-
sent forms were approved by the insti-
tutional review boards of each center.
ASD diagnosis for patients in the AC
cohort was made by the patient’s
referring clinician (developmental-
behavioral pediatrician, neurologist,
pediatric psychologist, or psychiatrist)
by using the criteria for a pervasive
developmental disorder as outlined by
the American Psychiatric Association’s
DSM-IV-TR. These 461 patients com-
pleted at least 1 of 3 genetic tests, with
433 individuals completing all 3 tests,
and data were entered into the regis-
try (see Supporting Information, which
is published at www.pediatrics.org/
content/full/125/4/e727).
Another 472 patients, aged 15 months to
22 years, were added through samples
submitted for clinical genetic testing to
the Children’s Hospital Boston DNA Diag-
nostic laboratory. ASD diagnosis was
based on clinical test requisition forms
and medical record review to conﬁrm
that DSM-IV-TR criteria were used.
Among multiplex families, test results
from only 1 affected family member
were included. For cases in which only
1 sample per family was submitted for
testing, we were not able to determine
if the family was simplex or multiplex;
thus, the overall proportion of cases

RESULTS

Patients
These patients were generally repre-
sentative of the broader population of
patients with ASD (Table 1), including a
male/female ratio of 4.24:1 (755 males
and 178 females), a roughly equal pro-
portion of patients with autistic disor-
der (n ⫽ 447 [47.9%]) and PDD-NOS

(n ⫽ 454 [48.7%]) and a minority of pa-
tients with Asperger disorder (n ⫽ 31
[3.3%]). Age at diagnosis ranged from
13 months to 22 years.

Genetic Testing Results
Karyotype testing identiﬁed abnormal
results in 19 of 852 patients (2.23%
[95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.73%–
2.73%]) (Table 2). CMA also detected
the abnormality in 8 of 19 (42.1%) with
an abnormal karyotype, but 10 of 19

ARTICLES

(52.6%) had balanced rearrangements
and appeared normal according to
CMA. Patient ASD-09-009 had low-level
mosaicism not detected by CMA. CMA
results corrected or clariﬁed ambigu-
ous karyotype results by demonstrat-
ing that a 15q duplication was a clini-
cally insigniﬁcant repetitive sequence
(patient ASD-09-011) and by precisely
deﬁning cytogenetically ambiguous
translocation break points (patient
ASD-09-016). Fragile X testing results
were abnormal for 4 patients (0.46%
[95% CI: 0.36%– 0.56%]) (Table 3), 2 of
whom were premutation carriers.
CMA was performed on 848 of 933 pa-
tients (90.9%). Most patients were
tested by CMA with whole-genome cov-
erage (697 of 848 patients [82.2%]), ei-
ther Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 244k
comparative genomic hybridization ar-
rays (589 of 848 patients [69.5%]) or
Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) 500k or
v5.0 single-nucleotide polymorphism
arrays (108 of 848 patients [12.7%]).
CNVs were identiﬁed in 154 of 848
patients (18.2% [95% CI: 14.76%–
21.64%]). Of these, 59 of 848 (7.0%
[95% CI: 5.5%– 8.5%]) had results con-
sidered “abnormal” or “possibly signif-
icant,” and 95 (11.2%) had results
considered variants of unknown signiﬁ-
cance (Table 4; see “Methods” for deﬁni-
tions). The detection rate for abnormal
or possibly signiﬁcant results by tar-
geted array was 5.3% (8 of 151), and the
rate for whole-genome array was 7.3%
(51 of 697). Variants classiﬁed as vari-
ants of unknown signiﬁcance (VUS) or

benign CNVs are listed in Supporting
Information.
Among abnormal variants, 50 of 60
(83%) were below the size range rou-
tinely detectable by karyotype (typi-
cally ⬃5 Mb). Many variants were rel-
atively large compared with the range
of typical CNVs. Previous surveys of
copy-number variation suggested that
more than 95% of CNVs are ⬍500 kilo-
bases (kb),13 and more recent data
with higher-resolution arrays sug-
gested that many more “small” CNVs
exist but were previously undetectable
because of technologic limitations.14
Abnormal CNVs in this study had a
mean size of 1896 kb and median of 546
kb (excluding 5 chromosomal aneu-
ploidy cases), with 35 of 60 (⬃58%)
larger than 500 kb. VUS (Supplemental
Data 2) identiﬁed in this study had
smaller size (mean size: 261 kb; me-
dian: 141 kb). It should be noted that 32
of 154 patients (⬃21%) had 2 abnor-
mal CNVs or VUS, and 9 of 204 patients
(4.4%) had 3 abnormal CNVs or VUS.
Secondary diagnoses were collected
from physician referral notes for the
AC cohort. In total, 54 of 461 individuals
(12%) were noted to have MR, and of
these, 12 of 54 (22%) had abnormali-
ties detected by microarray, 2 of 54
(3.7%) by karyotype, and 3 of 54 (5.6%)
by fragile X testing. In addition, 16 of
461 individuals (3.5%) were noted to

have dysmorphic features, of which 10
of 16 (63%) had abnormalities de-
tected by microarray and 2 of 16 (13%)
by karyotype testing. Seizures were re-
ported in 36 of 461 individuals (7.8%),
and of these, 8 of 36 (22%) had abnor-
malities detected by microarray and 2
of 36 (5.6%) by karyotype testing.
Those chromosomal abnormalities de-
tected by karyotype testing were also
detected by microarray analysis.
The male/female ratio in patients with
abnormal CMA ﬁndings was 3.2:1 (45
males/14 females). Slightly more fe-
male patients with ASD had abnormal
CMA results (14 of 157 [8.9%]) com-
pared with male patients (45 of 691
[6.5%]). Slightly more abnormal CMA
results were found among patients
with autistic disorder (34 of 403
[8.4%]) than patients with PDD-NOS (25
of 414 [6.2%]). Females with autistic
disorder had the highest abnormal
CMA rate (8 of 82 [9.8%]). Males with
autistic disorder and females with
PDD-NOS had a similar abnormal CMA
rate (both 8.1% [26 of 321 and 6 of 74,
respectively]). Males with PDD-NOS di-
agnosis had the lowest abnormal CMA
rate (5.5% [19 of 340]). No abnormal
CMA results were reported among the
small number of patients with As-
perger disorder (n ⫽ 31).
The abnormal CNVs detected in this co-
hort are quite diverse in terms of chro-

mosome distribution and size (Table
4). The only recurrent CNVs identiﬁed
were a 1.8-Mb region of chromosome
15q13.2q13.3
(chr15:28.7Mb-30.5Mb;
hg18; 2 deletions and 2 duplications)
and a 600-kb region of chromosome
16p11.2 (chr16: 29.5Mb-30.1Mb; hg18; 4
deletions and 2 duplications), together
accounting for 17% (10 of 59) of all ab-
normal CMA ﬁndings. No other recur-
rent CNVs were identiﬁed. Overall, CMA
had a higher yield than karyotype or
fragile X testing for clinical genetic
testing in this large cohort of patients
with ASD (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Our ﬁndings indicate that CMA with
whole-genome coverage detects more
abnormalities than G-banded karyo-
type and fragile X DNA testing in pa-
tients with ASD, and suggest that CMA
should be a ﬁrst-tier test in this patient
population. CMA could not entirely re-
place a G-banded karyotype in this pa-
tient population because of the in-
ability of CMA to detect balanced
rearrangements, but these are a small
proportion of abnormal results. We iden-
tiﬁed 10 patients with a balanced rear-
rangement representing 1.2% of all pa-
tients tested (n ⫽ 852). If these patients
had only been tested by CMA, then it is
possible that a pathogenic change would
be missed.
Although CMA does not detect bal-
anced rearrangements, a signiﬁcant
proportion of balanced rearrange-
ments are probably not clinically sig-
niﬁcant. The balanced pericentric in-
versions on chromosome 2 (patient
ASD-09-002) and chromosome 9 (pa-
tients ASD-09-017 and ASD-09-018)
could also occur in healthy individuals
and likely are not related to ASD. In
fact, the chromosome 2 inversion was
maternally inherited. Chromosome 9
inversions are known polymorphisms,
and also likely inherited, but parental
samples were not available for testing.
We found 6 cases of balanced translo-
cations, but they are also not neces-
sarily pathogenic. They may be inher-
ited from an unaffected parent,
making the child a balanced carrier
like the parent. Among 6 balanced
translocations in our cohort, 1 patient
(ASD-09-004) had the identical result
as the parent, 2 cases had no parent
data, and 3 cases were de novo. The de
novo balanced translocations are not
necessarily pathogenic, either. Bal-
anced rearrangements are known to
occur in healthy individuals, even
when they interrupt a known gene. In a
recent study of balanced rearrange-

ments that interrupt a gene, approxi-
mately half (16 of 31) were found in
healthy individuals.15
Pathogenic balanced rearrangements
are likely to account for only a small
number of ASD cases. Studies of cyto-
genetically balanced rearrangements
in large cohorts of patients with ASD
are not available, but such studies
have been done for patients with MR
and should be comparable. Balanced
rearrangements make up only ⬃10%
of cytogenetically visible abnormali-
ties in patients with developmental dis-
abilities such as MR, meaning that
only ⬃0.3% of patients would have
such changes.16–18 Although traditional
karyotyping could detect these events,
they represent a similarly small pro-
portion of cases in our cohort and may
or may not be related to ASD.
Patient ASD-09-009 had mosaicism for
a marker chromosome that is proba-
bly of little clinical signiﬁcance be-
cause (1) the level of mosaicism is low,
and (2) small marker chromosomes
typically contain gene-poor repetitive
DNA. CMA does not contain probes
from these repetitive DNA regions, and
the failure of whole-genome CMA to de-
tect this anomaly is actually evidence
that
the marker is repetitive DNA.
Karyotype testing and CMA can detect
mosaicism at the level of ⬃5% to 10%
abnormal cells and 30% abnormal
cells, respectively. We only found 1
such example of low-level mosaicism,
demonstrating that these events also
occurred at low frequency in our ASD
cohort.
The proportion of patients with posi-
tive results for any of the 3 tests in this
study was similar to other studies on
ASD, some of which were performed
on research samples.3,10,11,19 Our yield
for CMA was ⬍10%, perhaps for sev-
eral reasons. Whole-genome scans for
copy-number variation have identiﬁed
large de novo CNVs in 7% to 10% of
simplex ASD families (1 child affected),

2% to 3% of multiplex families, and only
1% of control families.10,19 Our patients
were added through clinical care and
were not selected on the basis of sim-
plex versus multiplex families and are,
therefore, not enriched for simplex
cases. Diagnostic yield of CMA may
have been limited by technical factors.
Some tests (⬃17%) were performed
on platforms that have coverage below
the ability to detect all 500-kb copy-
number changes. However, most of
our samples (83%) were tested by Agi-
lent 244k or Affymetrix 500k and v5.0
whole-genome arrays. The trend to-
ward higher yield with whole-genome
arrays as compared with targeted ar-
rays has been reported by authors of
other studies.7
We might have expected to ﬁnd higher
numbers of deﬁnite abnormal results
for CMA on the basis of yields for pa-
tients with generalized MR, which are
ⱖ10%.20,21 Our yield was lower, but our
cohort of patients with ASD almost cer-
tainly contains more high-functioning
individuals than a cohort of patients
with MR, including 31 individuals with
Asperger disorder in whom no clini-
cally signiﬁcant CNVs were identiﬁed.
This suggests that yield from CMA may
be lower in patients with high function-
ing autism, and this is consistent with
other reports.22 Our cohort had a rela-
tively low proportion of patients with
secondary diagnoses known to have a
high rate of abnormalities on CMA.
Only 54 of 461 patients (11.7%) in the
AC cohort were diagnosed with MR by
medical record review. Similarly, only
16 of 461 patients (3.5%) in the AC co-
hort had a secondary diagnosis of mul-
tiple congenital anomalies, which was
reported to have CMA abnormalities in
19.9% of patients.8 Our yield of abnor-
mal results for fragile X testing was
also lower than expected but may rep-
resent a selection bias against pa-
tients with fragile X syndrome, as has
been suggested in similar studies.23

Two of these patients with fragile X
syndrome were premutation carriers,
but their results were included as ab-
normal because recent studies re-
vealed that there may be a higher inci-
dence of neuropsychiatric conditions,
including autism, among fragile X pre-
mutation carriers.24
Our study has potential limitations.
Our patients were diagnosed by clin-
ical evaluation using DSM-IV-TR crite-
ria. The gold standard for research
studies of ASD would include the Au-
tism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
(ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R) in addition to
meeting criteria for a pervasive devel-
opmental disorder as deﬁned by the
DSM-IV-TR. Some of the patients in-
cluded in this study may not have met
full research criteria for an ASD diag-
nosis if tested with the ADOS and ADI-R.
Removing some patients from our
sample on the basis of failure to meet
criteria for an ASD diagnosis because
of ADI-R/ADOS may actually increase
the proportion of patients with an ab-
normality by removing patients with a
milder phenotype. We cannot exclude
the possibility of bias based on ascer-
tainment of patients through tertiary
care centers. These patients may be
more likely to have abnormal genetic
test results because they were re-
ferred because of other complicating
factors such as speciﬁc family history
or dysmorphic features. We did not
observe a high rate of such issues, but
we cannot rule out underreporting
of complex features at the time of
ascertainment.
The causal
relationships between
many of the abnormal CNVs identiﬁed
in these patients with ASD and the clin-
ical symptoms will require further
study. Our conclusions about pathoge-
nicity are based on the best current
knowledge but could evolve over time.
In general, sporadic cases of autism
may be more likely caused by de novo

important

mutations.25 Inherited CNVs may also
contribute to autism or autistic symp-
toms but may have more mild effects
that could vary among family mem-
bers. It is ironic that many apparently
common recurrent pathogenic copy-
number changes may not be de novo
but exhibit decreased penetrance
and variable expressivity, such as
16p11.2,15q13.2q13.3 and 1q21.26–29
This has important implications for
recurrence risk counseling. Identifying
rare de novo copy-number changes
is equally
for genetic
counseling.
The increased yield of CMA, especially
in comparison with G-banded karyo-
type testing, has important clinical im-
pact. Genetic testing can be expensive,
and payers may not be willing to reim-
burse for 2 tests that provide similar
information. In such cases, CMA would
be an appropriate choice despite a
small number of balanced rearrange-
ments that would be undetectable. Al-
though we identiﬁed slight differences
in the rate of abnormal CMA results
based on gender and speciﬁc ASD cat-
egory, these should not inﬂuence clin-
ical decisions about offering CMA
given the small magnitude of differ-
ences and also the potential variability
of diagnosis over time, particularly in
young children.30–32 Also, other genetic
testing may be indicated in select pop-
ulations of patients with ASD (eg, test-
ing for MECP2 mutations among girls
with ASD and microcephaly or testing
for PTEN mutations among boys or
girls with ASD and macrocephaly).33,34
Establishing a clear diagnosis may lead
to earlier initiation of services and con-
sequently improve outcome.35–38 In most
cases of ASD, some clinical symptoms
are apparent before the age of 3 years,
but in many cases children may not be
diagnosed until they are much older.39
ASD will remain a clinical diagnosis,
but identifying a clear genetic etiology
is advantageous in several ways. A

ARTICLES

clear genetic diagnosis can affect pa-
tient management decisions, availabil-
ity of developmental services, and ac-
curacy of genetic counseling about
recurrence risks, which may range
from ⬍5% to as high as 50% depend-
ing on the cause. A clear genetic diag-
nosis also spares the patient and fam-
ily a diagnostic odyssey involving
multiple rounds of diagnostic testing.
Speciﬁc clinical recommendations for
including CMA as a ﬁrst-tier test in the
evaluation of patients with ASD have
not kept pace with this rapidly evolving
technology. Considerations for includ-
ing CMA in the evaluation of children
with ASD have been outlined else-
where4,40,41 but have stopped short of
recommending that CMA be offered as
a ﬁrst-tier genetic diagnostic test for
ASD. On the basis of our results, ge-
netic diagnosis will be missed in at
least 5% of ASD cases without CMA,
and our results suggest that CMA with
whole-genome coverage should be
adopted as a national standard of care
for genetic testing among patients
with ASDs.
