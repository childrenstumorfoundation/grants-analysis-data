Introduction: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage dis-
ease caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deﬁ ciency. The disease primarily affects children and invari-
ably leads to premature death. In previous work with a mouse model of MLD, we used a lentiviral 
vector (LV) to introduce a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ex vivo and 
showed that reinfusion of the engineered HSCs prevented and corrected disease manifestations  
in the animals. To determine whether this gene therapy strategy is safe and can offer therapeutic 
beneﬁ t to patients with early-onset MLD, we designed a phase I/II trial.

Methods: We optimized LV manufacturing and HSC transduction in clinical grade conditions. Three 
children with ARSA deﬁ ciency and mutations associated with early-onset MLD were treated at the 
presymptomatic stage; all had at least one older sibling affected by the same disease variant. HSCs 
from the patients were transduced ex vivo with a LV carrying the ARSA gene.

Patients were treated with a myeloablative busulfan conditioning regimen before reinfusion of 
the engineered HSCs. Clinical and objective evaluations were collected up to 24 months after treat-
ment. Molecular follow-up of vector integration site distribution was performed on hematopoietic 
cells derived from bone marrow and peripheral blood.

Results: There was high-level stable engraftment of the transduced HSCs in the bone marrow and 
peripheral blood of all patients at all times tested, with 45 to 80% of bone marrow–derived hema-
topoietic colonies harboring the vector. With these high gene marking levels,  ARSA activity was 
reconstituted to above normal values in the hematopoietic lineages and in the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid. 
Analysis of >36,000 differ ent LV integration sites showed that the high gene marking was sus-
tained by highly polyclonal engr aftment of transduced cells without evidence of aberr ant clonal 
behavior. Several integration sites were shared among progenitors and mature myeloid, B- and 
T-cells sampled at long intervals after treatment, indicat-
ing efﬁ cient transduction and engraftment of HSCs. These 
ﬁ ndings were associated with a clear therapeutic beneﬁ t 
because the disease did not progress in any of the treated 
patients, even after the time of onset projected from sib-
ling cases.

Discussion:  Our  gene  therapy  protocol  allows  stable  
engraftment of transduced HSCs at high levels and with-
out evidence of vector-induced genotoxicity. The reconsti-
tution of ARSA activity in the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid and the 
arrested progression of neurodegenerative disease in the 
three treated patients demonstrate that the transplanted 
cells, or their progeny, can seed the nervous system and 
deliver therapeutic levels of active enzyme. Although our 
data are promising, long-term follow-up of the patients is 
needed in order to establish the full therapeutic potential 
of this gene therapy strategy for MLD. In addition, our data 
position LV gene transfer as a feasible means to engineer 
human hematopoiesis to its near entirety—an approach 
that could be exploited for treatment of other diseases.

HSC gene therapy can prevent progression of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Magnetic reso-

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by
arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency. Patients with MLD exhibit progressive motor and cognitive
impairment and die within a few years of symptom onset. We used a lentiviral vector to transfer
a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients
who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.
After reinfusion of the gene-corrected HSCs, the patients showed extensive and stable ARSA
gene replacement, which led to high enzyme expression throughout hematopoietic lineages and
in cerebrospinal fluid. Analyses of vector integrations revealed no evidence of aberrant clonal
behavior. The disease did not manifest or progress in the three patients 7 to 21 months beyond
the predicted age of symptom onset. These findings indicate that extensive genetic engineering
of human hematopoiesis can be achieved with lentiviral vectors and that this approach may
offer therapeutic benefit for MLD patients.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)

is an autosomal recessive lysosomal
storage disease caused by mutations in
the ARSA gene that result in a deficiency of the
enzyme arylsulfatase A (1). ARSA deficiency
causes accumulation of the enzyme substrate
sulfatide in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and cer-
tain neurons of the central nervous system (CNS),
and in Schwann cells and macrophages of the
peripheral nervous system (PNS). This build-up
of sulfatide leads to widespread demyelination
and neurodegeneration, which is ultimately mani-
fested in patients as severe progressive motor and
cognitive impairment. MLD is classified into clin-
ical variants according to the age of symptom
onset. Patients with the late-infantile (LI) variant
show symptoms within the second year of life,
have the most severe manifestations of the dis-
ease, and die within a few years of symptom on-
set. Current treatments do not substantially delay
the progression or fatal outcome of MLD (2, 3).
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
and HSC gene therapy (HSC-GT) have been in-
vestigated for the treatment of lysosomal storage
diseases because enzyme-proficient hematopoietic
progeny cells can migrate to the affected tissues,
including the CNS, scavenge the stored material,
such as sulfatide in MLD, and cross-correct the
resident cells (4). The efficacy of these treatments
varies among different types of lysosomal storage
diseases (3, 5–7) and with the extent of functional
gene expression in the transplanted cells (8–11).

Achieving a high level of functional gene replace-
ment is particularly important in the setting of
HSC-GT; to date, gene replacement in the hem-
atopoietic cells of treated patients has been lim-
ited (12–15).

In a mouse model of MLD, we have dem-
onstrated that disease manifestations can be
prevented and corrected with lentiviral vector
(LV)–based HSC-GT but not HSCT (8, 9, 16).
This is consistent with the observation that
HSCT fails to provide consistent benefits in MLD
patients (3, 5–7). LV-based HSC-GT induced ex-
tensive and supraphysiological expression of the
functional ARSA gene throughout the HSC proge-
ny, which in turn mediated widespread cross-
correction of CNS and PNS resident cells (8, 9).
Translating this strategy into a clinical pro-
tocol, however, posed several challenges, includ-
ing gene transfer efficacy and safety. Although
stable marking (10 to 15%) was reported in two
patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy
(X-ALD) in the first trial of LV-mediated HSC-
GT (17), it was not clear whether LVs could trans-
duce human HSCs in clinically relevant settings
with the efficiency required for application to MLD
gene therapy. Vector safety is also a concern in
light of the clinical experience with g-retroviral
vectors, which showed that genome-wide vector
integration in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
(HSPCs) has the potential to trigger leukemia
through insertional mutagenesis (14, 18). Although
several studies have shown that LVs reduce the

risk of genotoxic insertions because of their ad-
vanced design and the integration site selection
typical of the parental HIV (19, 20), it remained
possible that increasing the total integration load
in the infused HSPCs would offset the biosafety
advantage.

In the present study, we optimized LV-mediated
gene transfer into human HSCs for clinical trans-
lation and used this HSC-GT protocol to treat
nine patients with early onset MLD in a phase I/II
trial. Here, we report the outcome of the treat-
ment in the first three treated patients at 24 months
follow-up for patient MLD01 and 18 months
follow-up for patients MLD02 and MLD03.

Results

Efficient ex Vivo Transfer of the ARSA Gene
into the HSPCs of MLD Patients
Transduction of human bone marrow (BM)–
derived CD34+ cells was optimized to reach ≥2
vector copy number per genome (VCN) (fig. S1),
based on the ARSA overexpression levels re-
quired for therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies
(8, 9, 21, 22). CD34+ cells were stimulated ex vivo
with early acting cytokines in serum-free medi-
um and transduced with purified third-generation
LVs encoding the human ARSA cDNA under the
control of the human phosphoglycerate kinase
promoter (PGK) (fig. S2). VCN was measured in
the progeny of the treated cells obtained by means
of bulk liquid culture, colony-forming assays and
repopulation of chimeric Rag2−/− gchain−/− mice.

A summary of the LV manufacturing process
(flow chart, main steps, and yields) as well as the
specifications set for testing the good manufac-
turing practice (GMP) lots released for this study
are reported in fig. S3 and tables S1 and S2.

After optimizing the gene transfer procedures
for human cells, we designed a clinical trial of
HSC-GT in which autologous HSPCs from pa-
tients with MLD would be transduced ex vivo
with ARSA-encoding LVs and then reinfused after
the patients had been treated by a myeloablative
regimen using the alkylating agent busulfan (fig.
S4). Because MLD patients usually express resid-
ual, nonfunctional ARSA protein, they are unlike-
ly to mount an immune response toward ARSA.
Our trial design therefore did not include immuno-
suppressive agents.

Three presymptomatic MLD patients, bio-
chemically characterized for ARSA deficiency
and carrying mutations associated with LI MLD,
were enrolled and treated; all patients had one or
more older siblings with LI MLD onset within 2
years of age (table S3). At enrollment, patients
were defined as presymptomatic based on the lack
of obvious clinical signs of the disease, indepen-
dent of the presence of abnormalities in instru-
mental tests [electroneurographic recordings (ENG)
and/or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)].
Treatment of the patients began 2 to 12 months
before the reported age of onset of the disease in
their affected matched siblings (23–25).

Twenty to 30 days after collection of an HSC
back-up, a BM harvest was performed followed
by isolation of CD34+ cells by means of standard
immunomagnetic procedures. Transduction of pa-
tients’ CD34+ cells was performed as described
above. Cells were washed, resuspended, and kept
at +4°C until successful completion of a first
panel of fast quality control (QC) tests (table S4).
The transduced CD34+ cells were then released
and infused fresh intravenously. Other relevant
QC results (table S4) became available 2 to 5 weeks
after infusion. VCN ranged from 2.5 to 4.4, trans-
duction efficiency was 90 to 97%, and ARSA ac-
tivity was reconstituted at ≥10-fold the level
measured in healthy controls in the cultured prog-
eny of the infused cells (fig. S1 and table S5).

A myeloablative, dose-adjusted busulfan reg-
imen [target area under the curve (AUC) 4800
mg/L*hour] (table S5) was administered intravenous-
ly to the patients from day –4 up to day –1 before
HSC-GT in a total of 14 doses, with the last busulfan
dose administered ≥24 hours before trans-
duced cell infusion. The conditioning regimen
was well tolerated. The patients experienced severe
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/ml)
from as early as day +9 up to day +45 after trans-
plant at the latest (fig. S5 and table S5). No re-
duction or only a minor transient reduction of
lymphocyte counts was observed in the absence
of immunosuppressive/lymphotoxic drugs in the
pretransplant conditioning (fig. S5). Patients re-
quired transfusional support up to day +45 after
treatment for thrombocytopenia and anemia (fig.
S5). Thereafter, the patients rapidly recovered he-

matological parameters matching the normal val-
ues for age. No abnormal expansion or clonal
outgrowth was detected in the peripheral blood
(PB) and BM by cell type composition, cytologic,
karyotypic, or immunophenotypic studies (fig.
S5). A mild (maximum National Cancer Institute/
National Institutes of Health common toxicity cri-
teria grade 2) transient increase in hepatocellular
enzyme levels was detected within 2 to 3 weeks
after treatment. Serious adverse events included
two cases of central venous catheter–related in-
fection, which promptly resolved upon antibio-
tic treatment. Replication competent LVs (RCLs),
antibodies to HIV Gag p24, and antibodies to
ARSA in patients’ PB were negative at all times
tested.

High-Level Engraftment of the Transduced
HSPCs and Sustained ARSA Reconstitution
Beginning 1 month after transplant, we observed
high-level stable engraftment of the transduced
cells in the BM and PB of all patients at all times
tested (Fig. 1A). Between 45 and 80% of the
colonies outgrown from patients’ BM in the colony-
forming cell (CFC) assay harbored the LV ge-
nome (Fig. 1A). Quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) on CD34+ cells sorted from the
patients’ BM showed stable gene marking with
VCN ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 up to the latest follow-
up time (Fig. 1B). Considering the fraction of
cells harboring the vector (estimated from the
percentage of clonogenic progenitors outgrown
from the patients’ BM positive for LV DNA),
these values imply a VCN of 2 to 4 in the en-
grafted transduced CD34+ cells, which closely

matches the data measured on the in vitro prog-
eny of the infused cells. Correspondingly high and
stable gene marking was observed in the circulat-
ing CD15+ granulocytes and CD14+ monocytes
(Fig. 1C), and in myeloid cells and progenitors
isolated from the BM (fig. S6), beginning with
the first sampling and throughout the follow-up.
A progressive increase in gene marking of lym-
phoid cells was observed—more rapid for B and
NK cells and delayed for the longer-lived T cells—
as expected from the choice of the conditioning
regimen (Fig. 1C and fig. S6). The different re-
population kinetics of hematopoietic lineages by
the transduced HSCs accounts for the progressive
increase of the gene-marking level observed in
total PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Fig. 1D).
The high level of gene marking drove recon-
stitution of the defective ARSA activity up to
above-normal values in the most therapeutically
relevant myeloid populations (Fig. 2, A and B) as
well as in other circulating cells (fig. S7, A and
B). ARSA protein was isolated from patient hem-
atopoietic cells as early as 1 month after treatment
(fig. S7C) at above-normal expression levels in
all tested samples (fig. S7D). The enzyme iso-
lated from patient cells was found to hydrolyze
the natural substrate sulfatide in vitro, confirming
full functionality (0.003 mU of ARSA isolated from
normal donor and treated patients’ hematopoietic
cells hydrolyzed 3.6 T 1.2 nmol of substrate). In
situ hybridization for LV mRNA and immuno-
fluorescence for ARSA expression costained a high
proportion of patients’ blood cells consistently with
the high VCN detected by means of quantitative
PCR in these cells (fig. S8 and table S6). Func-

tional ARSAwas isolated from cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) collected from all three patients 1 year (and
2 years for MLD01) after HSC-GT at levels and
activity comparable with those obtained from healthy
donor samples, whereas no ARSA protein could
be isolated from CSF before HSC-GT treatment
(Fig. 2, C and D). These data demonstrate stable
above-normal ARSA expression throughout the hem-
atopoietic lineages and efficient delivery and bio-
availability of the enzyme in the CNS after HSC-GT.

HSC-GT Provides Therapeutic Benefit to
MLD Patients
Clinical observation and objective evaluations
were collected up to 24 months after treatment
for MLD01 and up to 18 months after treatment
for MLD02 and MLD03. At the last follow-up,
MLD01, MLD02, and MLD03 were 39, 30, and
25 months old, respectively (table S3). Because
disease onset in the LI variant occurs invariably
before 24 months of age and clinical manifes-
tations are highly homogeneous, in particular among
siblings (23, 24), all three patients in our study
were evaluated beyond their expected age of dis-
ease onset.

MLD01 is particularly informative because the
follow-up time for this patient is longest and be-
cause the predicted time of symptom onset was
earlier than that of the other two patients. This
patient’s two older siblings manifested regression
of psychomotor performance and arrest of acqui-
sition of new motor and cognitive skills at 18 months
of age. Consistent with LI-MLD natural history
(26), both siblings had rapid disease progression
after onset and reached level 6 of the Gross Mo-
tor Function Scale for MLD (GMF-C MLD) (27)

by 30 months of age, when they were wheelchair-
bound and unable to support their head and trunk
(table S7). In contrast, at 39 months of age MLD01
was able to stand independently and to walk and
run with single aid (either the hand of another
individual or an external walking device) (level 2
of the GMF-C MLD scale) (table S7). His Gross
Motor Function Measure (GMFM) score pro-
gressively increased from enrollment (GMFM
score of 164) up to a score of 193 at 39 months,
which was substantially higher than all the scores
recorded in our age-matched historical LI-MLD
cohort [5.5 on average (26)], suggesting a con-
tinuous motor development (Fig. 3A and table
S8). Cognitive evaluation by the Bayley Scale of
Infant and Toddler Development revealed a nor-
mal composite IQ score for chronological age,
with normal language and cognitive abilities (table
S9) at all tested time points, including the last
one at 39 months of age, an age at which the two
affected siblings were incapable of any voluntary
speech. The preexisting severe peripheral neuro-
pathy of MLD01 [nerve conduction velocity (NCV)
index (26) –11.5 at baseline] improved after treat-
ment (NCV index –7.1 at last follow-up) (Fig. 3B).
Brain MRI showed slight signal inhomogeneity,
present since baseline evaluation and stable there-
after, and a small area of hyper-intensity in the
corpus callosum that appeared at the 12-month
follow-up and remained stable thereafter. All
other brain MR findings were normal for age (Fig.
3C). In contrast, untreated LI-MLD patients invar-
iably develop extensive and severe demyelination
associated with diffuse atrophy by 24 to 36 months
of age (Fig. 3C) (26, 28). To our knowledge, no
unequivocally diagnosed LI-MLD patient at the

age of 39 months has been reported to display
clinical features as positive as those we observed
in MLD01.

Patients MLD02 and MLD03 remain fully
asymptomatic, with normal motor and cognitive
development for their ages (30 and 25 months,
respectively); however, the clinical follow-up pe-
riod for these patients after the predicted time of
symptom onset was shorter than that for MLD01.
At the latest clinical follow-up (18 months after
treatment), MLD02 was 7 months beyond and
MLD03 was 10 months beyond the predicted
time of symptom onset. Both patients had a
GMF-C MLD score of 0 at the last evaluation,
which is in sharp contrast with the disease evo-
lution documented in their affected siblings at the
corresponding age (table S7). Their GMFM scores
progressively increased after treatment, which is
consistent with the acquisition of normal devel-
opmental motor milestones for age (Fig. 3A and
table S8). Furthermore, in both patients the Bayley
Scale of Infant and Toddler Development showed
a normal composite IQ score for the age at all
times tested (table S9). The ENG findings for both
patients remained stable from baseline up to the
latest follow-up; MLD02 showed near normal
motor and sensory conduction velocities since
baseline, whereas MLD03 showed a stable mild
demyelinating neuropathy (Fig. 3B). Brain MRI
revealed that both patients had a normal progres-
sion of white matter signal due to myelination up
to the latest follow-up. MLD02 had small areas of
T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
hyper-intensity signal in posterior and anterior peri-
ventricular white matter, present since baseline and
stable up to the latest follow-up (fig. S9).

Polyclonal Reconstitution of Hematopoiesis
Without Evidence of Vector Genotoxicity
To determine whether there was any cause for
concern regarding the safety of the LV in these
patients, we monitored the clonal dynamics of
hematopoietic repopulation at the molecular level
by analyzing the vector genomic integrations in
the patients’ reconstituted hematopoietic cells (figs.
S10 and S11, table S10, and materials and meth-
ods). Because of the genome-wide quasi–random
integration profile of LV, each insertion creates a
different genetic marker that can be used to track
the clonal behavior of individual transduced cells.
Genomic DNA was obtained from whole BM,

PB cells, and subsets (table S11) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and
12 months for all patients and, for MLD01 and
MLD02, 18 months after HSC-GT (table S12).
Vector-genome junctions were retrieved by means
of linear amplification mediated–PCR (LAM-PCR)
by using three different restriction enzymes (fig.
S12). From the three patients, >800 independent
LAM-PCRs were generated and sequenced by
454-Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and Illumina (San
Diego, California) technologies to obtain >10 × 106
sequence reads. Using a bioinformatics analysis
pipeline and collision/contamination filtering (fig.
S10, fig. S13, and table S13, A to C), we mapped
integration sites (IS) for patient MLD01 (1,120,414),

at baseline (before GT) and at +2 years after treatment, and corresponding (equivalent) images of an age-
matched untreated patient with LI-MLD (in parenthesis, the chronological age at imaging acquisition in
months). In MLD01 images, a small area of hyperintensity is present within the splenium of the corpus
callosum, stable in extension and appearance as compared with that in the +12 months follow-up; subtle
signal inhomogeneities are present within posterior periventricular and posterior centrum semiovale
white matter, in the absence of focal lesions; these inhomogeneities, present since baseline as just barely
T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity signal, are (now) more evident because of the normal signal of the
surrounding myelin; subarachnoid and ventricular spaces are within normal limits, even if a little wider
when compared with that of the baseline. Basal ganglia and thalami remain of normal appearance. In UT
LI-MLD images, extensive, diffuse symmetric hyperintensities with typical “tigroid pattern” are seen within
periventricular white matter, centrum semiovale, corpus callosum, external and internal capsules, and
cerebellar deep white matter. A severe diffuse brain atrophy involving basal ganglia and thalamy, which
show T2 hypointense signal, is also present.

MLD02 (1,518,802), and MLD03 (425,356)
on the human genome (NCBI HG19). Because
many identical ISs were retrieved from multiple
lineages and/or time points, the number of distinct
ISs was 14,482, 11,077, and 10,959 for patients
MLD01, MLD02 and MLD03, respectively. The
genomic distribution of IS, both in the in vitro–
cultured CD34+ cells and in vivo, matched the
previously reported LV preference for integration
within transcriptional units (on average, 80% of
IS were within genes) (fig. S14). To identify the
gene classes preferentially targeted by LV inte-
grations, we analyzed IS data sets from either the
in vitro progeny of the infused CD34+ cells or a
pool of all in vivo–harvested samples for each
patient using the GREAT (Genomic Regions En-
richment of Annotations Tool) software (table S14,
A to F). In all patients, the gene classes of chro-
matin modification/remodeling, major histocom-
patibility complex class II–related functions, steroid
hormone receptors, and RNA processing were
overrepresented (table S14, A to F). These gene
classes were the same, or shared >75% genes,
with gene classes overrepresented in the ALD
HSC-GT (17, 29) (Fig. 4A and fig. S15).

We measured the proportion of sequencing
reads representing each IS within our data sets as
a surrogate readout for the relative abundance of
the cell clone harboring that integration at a given
time. For each time point, we analyzed the IS data
sets from the CD34+, myeloid (pooled CD13+,
CD14+, and CD15+ data sets), B (CD19+) and
T cells (CD3+). Almost every cell clone marked
by a specific IS accounted for only a fraction of a
percent of the total clones at any given time. A
few IS-marked cell clones showed a higher per-
centage at one time point but then disappeared or
were strongly reduced at later time points (Fig. 4,
B and C, and fig. S16). From these results, we
conclude that no clonal dominance events occurred
in these patients.

To determine whether other hallmarks of in-
sertional mutagenesis were present in the patients,
we assessed the occurrence of common insertion
sites (CISs), insertional hotspots that may result
from integration bias at the time of transduction
or in vivo selection of clones harboring integra-
tions that confer growth advantage. CISs were
identified with an algorithm based on Abel et al.
(30) and by the Grubbs test for outliers (29). Both
analyses showed that the MLD CISs were mostly
distributed in clusters within gene-dense regions
heavily targeted by LV integrations (Fig. 5A, figs.
S17 to S19, and tables S15 and S16), many of
which had already been described in the ALD
HSC-GT trial (Fig. 5B) (17, 29). Given the larger
size of the MLD data set, it contained almost the
entire ALD CIS data set. Moreover, the Grubbs
test for outliers when applied to the genomic re-
gions surrounding each CIS confirmed that the
CIS from the MLD clinical trial were not signif-
icantly over-targeted with respect to the neighbor-
ing genes, with OPTC being the only exception
(fig. S19F and table S16). Cell clones with IS
targeting CIS genes did not represent the most

not detected in samples from the longest follow-
up time point.

Extensive HSC Gene Marking in Vivo
To assess HSC gene marking in vivo, we ana-
lyzed the subset of IS shared among three data

sets representing progenitors and mature myeloid
and mature lymphoid cells in each patient. After
stringent filtering to reduce the false discovery
rate due to the impurity of each cell fraction ana-
lyzed and the occurrence of collisions during IS
processing (fig. S20 and table S17), a fraction of
ISs were consistently shared among the three data
sets of each patient (Fig. 6A). This fraction in-

creased with follow-up time (Fig. 6B). We then
plotted the occurrence of shared ISs in each sub-
set of cells over time, considering the B and T
cells separately, and ranked them for multiple hits
(Fig. 6C and table S18). The increasing presence
over time of CD34+ progenitors and mature cells
of myeloid and lymphoid lineages marked by
identical integrations is evidence of self-renewal

gration profile. (A) Gene on-
tology (GO) analysis on ISs
from three patients with MLD
and two patients with ALD who

using the GREAT software (http://

The genomic positions of ISs
in each data set were weighted
by the binomial test in order
to evaluate the clustering at
given genomic regions and
by the hypergeometric test in
order to evaluate the overrep-
resentation of gene functions.
GO classes were considered sig-
nificant when both tests pro-
vided a false discovery rate of
<0.05. To compare the level
of similarity between the gene
classes preferentially targeted
by LV integrations in ALD and
MLD clinical trials, we counted
the number of shared genes
contained in the significantly
overrepresented gene classes
for GO molecular functions of
each clinical trial (results for
GO biological processes are
shown in fig. S13). The extent
of gene sharing between the
overrepresented gene classes
are indicated by a color scale.

IS, colored cells indicate retrieval at ≥5%, with higher color intensity indicating
higher percentage, whereas gray cells indicate retrieval at low percentage
(from 0.006% to <5%). Lack of color indicates that the integration was not

dicated. Almost all integrations reached ≥5% at only one time point.

and multilineage potential of the transduced en-
grafted HSCs.

To estimate the number of HSCs contributing
to hematopoietic reconstitution, we used the frac-
tion of ISs shared between independent samplings
of the same cell population (supplementary
materials, materials and methods). For this analy-
sis, we considered the output of short-lived mature
myeloid cells in the PB long-term after HSC-GT
as readout of total HSC activity at that time. We
compared ISs shared between CD14+ and CD15+
PB cells at months 9, 12, and 18 after HSC-GT
by the mark-recapture approach using the Petersen/
Schnabel estimator method (31) and Chao Poisson
regression model (table S19). The resulting lower
bound population size estimates were 3.7 × 103
to 5.7 × 103 in patient MLD01 and 2.1 × 103 to
3.4 × 103 in MLD02, indicating an abundant pool
of engrafted transduced self-renewing progeni-
tors in both patients.

To quantify clonal diversity in each lineage
over time, we calculated the Shannon Diversity
Index (Fig. 6D and fig. S22). This index mea-
sures the entropy of an IS data set taking into
account the total number of ISs and their relative
contribution. The diversity of CD34+ progenitors
was lower early after HSC-GT as compared with
that of the infused cell population and then in-

creased and stabilized. PB myeloid cells showed
high and stable diversity, which is consistent with
that of the progenitor pool, whereas B and T cell
diversity increased with time and stabilized 6
months after gene therapy. Patient MLD03 showed
lower IS sharing between lineages and decreas-
ing diversity of myeloid cells as compared with
the other two patients, possibly because of the
shorter follow-up and the higher VCN of the
infused cells.

Overall, these data provide evidence that ef-
ficient ex vivo gene transfer was followed by sub-
stantial engraftment and sustained clonogenic
activity of the transduced HSCs in the patients,
resulting in extensive polyclonal reconstitution
of hematopoiesis with gene-corrected cells.

Discussion
LI MLD is a devastating disease that invariably
leads to death of affected children within a few
years of symptom onset. We have shown that HSC-
GT halted disease manifestation and/or progression
in three presymptomatic children with LI-MLD
for follow-up times ranging from 18 to 24 months
after treatment (7 to 21 months after predicted
disease onset).

The clinical benefit observed in the three pa-
tients was accompanied by measurable objective

findings ascertained through brain imaging and
electrophysiological and biochemical studies and
is in contrast with the disease evolution observed
in (i) the patients’ older affected siblings with
matched ARSA mutations and related genetic
background and (ii) our historical cohort of un-
treated LI-MLD patients. MRI analysis detected
a minor demyelinating lesion in the brain of MLD01
1 year after treatment. This minor lesion, which
might have arisen before the infused cells reached
a sufficient CNS engraftment to exert beneficial
effects, remained stable at all subsequent follow-
ups. This finding is clearly different from what is
observed in untreated LI-MLD patients, who show
rapidly progressive and widespread brain demye-
lination. The severe peripheral neuropathy already
present in MLD01 at the time of HSC-GT improved
after treatment, with amelioration of the amplitude
of motor action potentials and of the nerve con-
duction velocities after treatment. These findings
were associated with clinical evidence of normal
cognitive evolution and continuous improvements
in motor skills. Although the follow-up is shorter
for MLD02 and MLD03, these patients remained
asymptomatic at a chronological age when their
disease was expected to have manifested.

In previous work with the MLD mouse mod-
el, we showed that the therapeutic benefit of

HSC-GT arises from the homing of ARSA-
overexpressing HSPCs and/or their myeloid prog-
eny to the CNS and PNS, where they contribute
to the replacement of a substantial fraction of
microglia/resident macrophages, scavenge the stored
sulfatide, and establish a local source of func-
tional enzyme bioavailable throughout the neural
tissues. Although we could not directly probe our
patients for the migration of gene-modified cells
into the CNS, we documented that CSF samples
from the patients contained substantial levels of
ARSA protein and activity long after HSC-GT.
This objective finding, together with the halted
progression of neural disease, suggests that the CNS
and PNS were seeded by gene-corrected myeloid
cells upon HSC-GT.

Recent studies in mice have shown that mi-
croglia mostly originates from an early seeding of
neural tissues by embryonic lineage macrophages
followed by in situ turnover under homeostatic
conditions (32). However, substantial replacement

of microglia with donor-derived cells was shown
after myeloablation and intravenous infusion of
HSPCs (8, 33, 34). The latter findings are con-
sistent with clinical evidence that HSCT can pro-
vide therapeutic benefit in certain lysosomal
storage diseases affecting the CNS, and with the
few available studies investigating the donor
origin of microglia cells within the brains of trans-
planted humans (35, 36). We speculate that
high-level engraftment of the myeloid compart-
ment in PB and BM by the transduced HSPCs is
likely needed to support their efficient migration
to the neural tissues. It is possible, however, that
myeloid progenitors, rather than mature mono-
cytes, are primarily responsible for seeding the
CNS in our patients (34).

At least three factors may have contributed to
the high levels of gene replacement observed in
patients’ hematopoiesis. First, we optimized the
LV-manufacturing process, aiming to produce vec-
tor with high titer, infectivity, and purity using

stringent lot-release criteria so as to ensure efficient
transduction while limiting detrimental effects on
HSPCs. Second, we validated the transduction
protocol for reproducible high-rate gene transfer
into BM-derived mouse-repopulating human
HSPCs and infused fresh cells after transduction
to avoid incurring in any cell loss associated with
freeze/thawing. Last, we administered a dose-
adjusted myeloablative regimen before HSPC
infusion to foster engraftment.

Another key goal of our study was to assess
the long-term safety of HSC gene transfer. Using
deep-sequencing and bioinformatics, we found
no evidence that cell clones harboring ISs under-
go in vivo expansion or selection. Rather, our data
suggest that the genomic distribution of IS in pa-
tients’ hematopoietic cells reflects the LV inte-
gration in the infused HSPCs. These findings are
in sharp contrast with those reported at compa-
rable times after HSC-GT in some other trials
using g-RV; in those trials, cell clones harboring

ISs that target oncogenes underwent expansion
or selection in vivo and eventually progressed to
leukemia (14, 18, 37–40). The LV IS distribution
in MLD patients overlaps with that reported for
ALD patients after LV-based HSC-GT, a reassur-
ing finding considering that no adverse effect of
gene transfer has been reported in that trial after
more than 5 years of follow-up. A similar inte-
gration profile in the absence of clonal expansion
was observed in three patients with Wiskott-
Aldrich Syndrome treated by LV-based HSC-GT
with a follow-up of up to 2.5 years (47). Overall,
these data strongly support the improved safety
of LV comprising self-inactivating long terminal
repeat and moderately active internal promoters,
which makes it unlikely that an insertion would ac-
tivate a nearby oncogene (19, 20, 41). Nevertheless,
we will continue longer-term evaluation of the
treated and additional patients for full assessment
of the risk-benefit ratio and therapeutic potential
of HSC-GT.

The stability of gene marking together with
the identification of several ISs shared among
progenitors, mature myeloid cells, and both ma-
jor lymphoid lineages long-term after HSC-GT
provide evidence that bona fide HSCs were trans-
duced. Furthermore, the estimated large number
of active HSCs would imply that a good fraction of
harvested HSCs were transduced and long-term
engrafted the patients. These data position LV gene
transfer as a feasible means to engineer human
hematopoiesis to its near entirety, an approach that
may be exploited to develop novel treatments
for several inherited and acquired diseases.

Materials and Methods

Clinical Protocol and Patients
The Istituto Superiore di Sanità and the Ethical
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute
in Milan approved the study. The study promoter
is TIGET, San Raffaele Hospital, Italy and the
financial sponsor of the study is the Telethon
Foundation. The medicinal product received
Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) (EMEA/OD/
102/06) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
for the treatment of MLD.

We enrolled and treated three presymptomatic
LI-MLD patients, who were classified as LI ac-
cording to the disease in their affected older sib-
lings using the historical classification based on
age at symptom onset (table S3). The patients were
from Lebanon, the United States, and Egypt. Upon
obtaining informed consent, their diagnosis was
molecularly and biochemically confirmed. In all
patients, the definitive MLD diagnosis was based
on pathologic low ARSA activity and the pres-
ence of disease-causing ARSA gene mutations on
both alleles. Presymptomatic condition at enroll-
ment was defined on the basis of a normal neuro-
logical and cognitive examination, independently
from the presence of abnormalities at neurophys-
iological tests or brain imaging.

Details on clinical study enrollment crite-
ria, endpoints, and study plan can be found at

ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01560182. The parents
of all subjects provided written informed con-
sent for experimental treatment. Biological sam-
ples were obtained from MLD patients—healthy
children and adults as controls—with approval
of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute’s Ethics
Committee and consent from parents or subjects.

Neurological and Motor Evaluation
A standard neurological evaluation was performed
in all patients for assessing the presence of disease
clinical signs. In addition, we applied GMFM
(26, 42) and the Gross Motor Function Classi-
fication for MLD (GMFC-MLD) (27) for prop-
er quantification of patients’ motor abilities. The
same trained personnel applied the scales at each
evaluation.

Neuropsychological Evaluation
Neuropsychological evaluation was performed by
using the Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler
Development (BSID-II) (43), applied at baseline
evaluation and then every 6 months.

Neurophysiological Evaluation
Sensory conduction of sural and median nerves,
and motor conduction of deep peroneal and ulnar
nerves were studied and a z score for NCV was
calculated for each examined nerve (patient’s
NCV – normal donors’ mean NCV/normal do-
nors’ NCV standard deviation); an NCV index
was calculated as the average of z scores obtained
from the four tested nerves for each patient per
time, as described (26).

MR Examination
All children underwent anatomical MRI on a 1.5
Tesla scanner using a six-channel SENSE head
coil (Gyroscan Intera, Philips, Netherlands). MRI
scans were performed with Spin Echo T1 weighted
images, repetition time (TR) 600 ms, echo time
(TE) 15 ms, rec matrix 288, 22 slices, 5 and 3 mm
thick, axial and sagittal planes; Turbo Spin Echo
T2-weighted images, TE120 ms, TR 5500 ms
24 slices, axial, sagittal and coronal planes,
4.5 and 3 mm thick; fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery Turbo Spin Echo, TE 140 ms, 24 slices,
4.5 mm thick; and volumetric T1 sequence (fast
field echo, 110 slices, 1.4 mm thick, and 0 mm
gap). MR examinations were performed under
sedation by a senior experienced pediatric an-
esthesiologist (44); sedation was induced with
intravenous 1 mg/kg propofol and maintained
with 4 mg/kg/hour propofol continuous infu-
sion. Throughout MRI examination, saturation of
peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was monitored with a
MRI-compatible device (Magnitude, Invivo Cor-
poration, Orlando, Florida). Desaturation (SpO2 <
95%) was recorded together with any adverse
event requiring the intervention of the attending
anesthesiologist.

Large-Scale Lentiviral Vector Production
The vector used in this study (pCCLsin.cPPT.
hPGK.hARSA.WPREmut6 - PGK.ARSA.LV) is

a self-inactivating lentiviral vector produced with
a third-generation split packaging system and
pseudotyped by the vesicular stomatitis virus G
protein (VSV.G) (6). The vector lots were pro-
duced by MolMed (Milan, Italy) using a large-scale
validated process. The vectors were produced
following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
guidelines, except for initial studies of gene trans-
fer protocol optimization, which used pre-GMP
(GMP-like/large scale produced) vector. The pro-
tocol for vector production is detailed in fig. S3.
Briefly, the ARSA LV was produced by means of
transient four-plasmid transfection of 293T cells.
293T cells were derived from human embryonic
kidney 293 cells with stable transfection of the
temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen; a subclone
of the 293T (from Stanford University) selected
at the Salk Institute (La Jolla, California) for its high-
yield performance in production of lentiviral vec-
tors through transient transfection was used for
MCB establishment; a 293T MCB was generated
at Genethon (Paris, France) in GMP conditions.
293T cells from the master cell bank were ex-
panded in T162 flasks and then in 10-tray cell
factories and transiently transfected by means of
calcium phosphate precipitation with four plas-
mids encoding for two core packaging constructs
(pKLGag/pol and pKRev), the envelope con-
struct (pK.G), and the transfer vector construct
(pARSA). Twenty-four hours after removal of
the transfection medium, the cell supernatant was
harvested and stored at 4°C. The culture medium
was replaced, and after a further 24 hours, a sec-
ond harvest was performed. The medium col-
lected from the two harvests was pooled and
filtered through 5/0.45-mm filters so as to discard
cell debris. The downstream purification process
included a benzonase treatment overnight at 4°C,
followed by a diethylamino anion exchange (DEAE)
chromatography step, concentration, and gel filtra-
tion in CellGro medium. The benzonase treatment
was aimed at degrading plasmid DNA and host
cell–derived DNA present in the clarified cell su-
pernatant, thus facilitating their removal through
subsequent purification steps. Anion exchange chro-
matography involved the absorption of negative-
ly charged lentiviral particles to positively charged
chromatographic support; viral particles were eluted
by increasing ionic strength. This step was aimed
at the removal of contaminants such as host cell
proteins and serum-derived proteins such as bo-
vine serum albumin (BSA). Gel filtration, also
defined as size exclusion chromatography, relies
on the inability of the large lentiviral particles to
be retained by matrix pores. This step was aimed
at the removal of salts and small-sized contam-
inants such as DNA fragments as well as at me-
dium exchange. The resulting LV preparation, in
CellGro medium, underwent one sterilizing
0.2-mm filtration and aseptic filling. The purified
vector preparation was stored at –80°C. The
produced vector lots were characterized as de-
scribed in table S2. Physical titer was measured
by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

capsid protein. Infectious titer was measured
through transduction of a human T cell line with
serial dilutions of vector and calculation of the
copies of integrated vector per cell by quantita-
tive PCR.

HSC Isolation and Transduction
For in Vitro Experiments
Healthy donor (HD) bone marrow CD34+ cells
were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland)
or obtained after written informed consent ac-
cording to standard ethical procedure and with
approval of the San Raffaele Institute Ethical Com-
mittee (protocol TIGET-01). CD34+ cells from
three MLD patients not enrolled in the gene ther-
apy trial—diagnosed on the basis of clinical symp-
toms, ARSA activity, and genetic analysis—were
similarly obtained after written informed consent
(protocol LDM1) at the time of diagnostic or ther-
apeutic procedures. CD34+ cells were purified
from mononuclear cells by means of positive se-
lection with immunomagnetic beads according to
the manufacturer’s procedure (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Soon after puri-
fication or thawing, CD34+ cells were placed in
culture on retronectin-coated non–tissue culture–
treated wells (T100A Takara) in CellGro SCGM
medium (2001 CellGenix) at a concentration of
1 × 106 cells/ml in the presence of cytokines
[interleukin-3 (IL-3, 60 ng/ml), thrombopoietin
(TPO, 100 ng/ml), stem cell factor (SCF, 300 ng/ml),
and Flt3 ligand (Flt3-L, 300 ng/ml); PeproTech,
Rocky Hill, New Jersey] for 24 hours of prestimu-
lation. Cells were then transduced with ARSA LV
[at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100] for 14
hours. In the protocol that foresees two rounds of
transduction, selected for clinical application, cells
were washed for 10 hours in CellGro SCGM me-
dium additioned with cytokines and underwent a
second hit of transduction in the same conditions
as the first. At the end of transduction, cells were
counted and collected for clonogenic assays, flow
cytometry, and in vivo studies. Remaining cells
were plated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s me-
dium (IMDM) –10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
with cytokines (IL-3, 60 ng/ml; IL-6, 60 ng/ml;
SCF, 300 ng/ml) and cultured for a total of 14 days.
Thereafter, cells were collected for molecular and
biochemical studies.

For Patients’ Treatment
Please refer to fig. S2. Total bone marrow was
collected from the iliac crests under sterile con-
ditions and using general anesthesia, on day –4,
according to an internal standard operating pro-
cedure. The total collected volume was estimated
according to the content of CD34+ cells evaluated
by previous bone marrow aspiration; on average,
20 to 25 ml/kg patient’s body weight was col-
lected. The harvested bone marrow—collected in
a dedicated bag, sealed, and identified—was then
transferred to MolMed S.p.A and kept in sterile
conditions in a refrigerator at 4°C for 24 hours.
CD34+ cells were then purified on day –3 from

mononuclear cells by means of positive selection
with immunomagnetic beads according to the
manufacturer’s procedure (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) in GMP conditions.
The purified cells were cultured in retronectin-coated
VueLife bags (American Fluoroseal, Gaithersburg,
Maryland) in serum-free medium supplemented
with GMP-grade cytokines and exposed twice to
GMP-grade–purified vector at multiplicity of infec-
tion of 100, for a total culture time of 60 hours. At
the end of the transduction procedure, the trans-
duced CD34+ cells were harvested, washed with
Cell Grow medium, and resuspended in saline
solution at the concentration of 2 × 106 to 10 ×
106/ml for patient’s infusion. At the end of trans-
duction, a fraction of the cells was collected for
clonogenic assays, flow cytometry, and in vitro
culture, as above. Cells were kept at 4°C up to
the time of infusion, upon batch release according
to quality control tests [results are available at
infusion for viability, immunophenotype, en-
dotoxin, large T Ag DNA, and mycoplasma
(table S4)].

Patients’ Conditioning
Patients received a total of 14 body weight–based
doses of intravenous busulfan, given every 6 hours
from day –4 to day –1. The busulfan plasmatic
levels were monitored with serial sampling fol-
lowing first and fifth infusion. The doses after the
5th and 10th were adjusted, if needed, accord-
ing to plasmatic Busulfan levels with an ideal
AUC of range 4200-5600 mg/L*hour, target
4800 mg/L*hour. The interval between the end of
the last intravenous busulfan dose and final product
infusion was ≥24 hours in order to allow safe in-
fusion of the stem cells. At day 0, after premed-
ication with clorfeniramine (0.25 mg/kg, max dose
10 mg) or equivalent drug, the resuspended CD34+
cell product was infused intravenously through
the central catheter.

During hospitalization, patients were cared
for in an isolation unit and received supportive
therapy according to local standards.

Isolation of Hematopoietic Subpopulations
from Patients’ Peripheral Blood
and Bone Marrow
Starting from mononuclear cells (MNCs) ob-
tained from Lymphoprep gradient, human bone
marrow and peripheral blood subpopulations
were obtained through positive selection of
the following markers (Miltenyi Biotec micro-
beads): CD34, CD13, CD15, CD56, CD19, CD3,
glycophorin A (GLYA), and CD61 from the
BM, and CD15, CD14, CD56, CD19, and CD3
from PB, according to manufacturer’s procedures.
Purity of each subpopulation was checked by
means of flow-cytometry. Data are reported in
table S11.

Clonogenic Assay (CFC)
The CFC assay was performed by means of plating
in methylcellulose medium (human MethoCult;
StemCell Technologies) either 800 to 1000 CD34+

cells/ml or 1.25 × 104 to 1 × 106 MNCs/ml
purified from BM or PB. After 14 days of culture,
colonies were counted, distinguishing myeloid
and erythroid origin, and plucked for molecular
analysis.

Quantitative PCR
Genomic DNA was extracted from CD34+ liq-
uid culture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), MNCs, PB, and BM subpopulations
of MLD patient samples with QIAamp DNA
Blood Micro and Mini Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Ger-
many). Single colonies plucked from the CFC as-
say were digested for 4 hours at 37°C in Lysis
Buffer (Lauryl Ether 0.1%, TRIS/hydrochloride
(HCL) 10 mM, 100 mg/ml Proteinase K). After
proteinase K inactivation (10 min at 95°C), lysates
were centrifuged at 13,000 revolutions per min at
4°C for 15 min.

LV sequences were detected by means of
quantitative PCR on 25 to 50 ng of total genomic
DNA or 10 ml of lysate supernatants by using
previously described primers and probe (22).

Absolute quantifications were plotted on stan-
dard curves prepared with serial dilutions of ge-
nomic DNA or cell lysate from a T cell clone
containing 1 copy HIV/cell.

Engraftment of the transduced cells was eval-
uated by means of quantitative PCR on individ-
ual colonies from CFC assay performed on either
PB- or BM-derived cells and expressed as per-
centage (%) of LV+ (VCN ≥ 0.5) colonies on total
tested colonies (≥ 250 cells/colony).

Analysis of Vbeta Repertoire
The analysis of Vbeta repertoire of the T cell
receptor was performed on 50 ml of patients’ total
PB according to the manufacturing procedure
described in the V Beta kit; Beckman Coulter
(823497) (Fullerton, California). 10000 events were
acquired with FACS Canto II (BD-Biosciences,
Europe) and then analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar,
Ashland, Oregon). The percentage of each Vbeta pop-
ulation was compared with the range of expres-
sion obtained from the analysis of a pool of 85
healthy donors provided by the manufacturer.

Immunophenotype Analysis
Analysis of the immunophenotype of patients’
total PB and BM was performed by Laboraf
(Ospedale San Raffaele) as described by inter-
nal SOPs.

ARSA Activity Determination
p-Nitrocatechol Sulfate (PNCS)
CD34+ liquid culture, PBMCs, MNCs, PB, and
BM subpopulations of MLD patients and healthy
donors were resuspended in sodium acetate tri-
hydrate 0.05 M (500,000 cells in 25 ml). Samples
were then sonicated and centrifuged, and the
supernatant was collected for ARSA activity and
protein quantification (Bradford assay; Biorad
#500-0006) (Hercules, California). ARSA ac-
tivity was detected with PNCS as substrate, as
described, loading a maximum concentration of

DEAE-Cellulose Chromatography and
4-Methyl-Umbellipheryl-Sulfate
Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-
buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 mM TRIS/
HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet
NP40 detergent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri).
Cell lysates were subjected to three rounds of
sonication. Procedures were carried out at 4°C.
Proteins were measured with the Bradford method
by using bovine serum albumin as standard.

Similar cell number (500,000 cells) was loaded
into a 0.2-ml DEAE chromatography column
equilibrated with a 25 mM TRIS/HCl buffer, pH
7.5. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. After washing
with 5 ml of 25 mM TRIS/HCl buffer plus 50 mM
NaCl, pH 7.5, enzyme activity retained by the
column was eluted by 2.5 ml TRIS/HCl buffer
plus 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (starting from frac-
tion n.5). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and
assayed for the ARSA activity by using the artifi-
cial fluorogenic substrate 4-methyl-umbellipheryl-
sulfate (MUS) dissolved in 0.05 M Na-acetate/
acetic acid buffer, pH 5.5. A volume of 50 ml of
test sample was incubated with 100 mL of a 0.01 M
solution of substrate respectively in the presence
and absence of 125 mM AgNO3 (a specific ARSA
inhibitor) at 37°C. Enzymatic reactions were stopped
by adding 0.2 M Glycine/NaOH, pH 10.6. Flu-
orescence of the liberated 4-methylumbelliferone
was measured on a Perkin Elmer LS3 spectro-
fluorimeter (excitation 360 nm, emission 446 nm).
ARSA activity was calculated by subtracting
the value obtained in the presence of AgNO3
[arylsulfatase B (ARSB) activity] from that mea-
sured in the absence of the inhibitor (ARSA+ARSB
activity) (45).

Sulphatide Assay
Sulfatide (5 mM) (Matreya, St. Pleasant Gap,
Pennsylvania) was resuspended in cloroform:
methanol:water (2:1:0.1), dried overnight at room
temperature, and resuspended in the ARSA
enzymatic buffer [100 mM Na/acetate, pH 4.5,
containing 20 mM MnCl2 and taurodeoxyxholate
(100 mg/50 ml)]. For the reaction (100 ml total
volume), 0.003 mU ARSAwere added to 21 nmol
sulfatide at 37°C for 24 hours. The assay was
stopped with 0.85 ml cloroform:methanol:water
(1:1) plus 0.85 50 mN sulfuric acid and 0.170 ml
Azure A [0.4 mg/ml]. After a centrifugation at
300 g × 5 min, the lower phase was recovered,
and the absorbance measured at 650 nm in a
microplate reader (GDV DV-990BV6). The naomoles
of sulfatide hydrolyzed by ARSA were calculated by
subtracting the value measured in the presence of
the enzyme respect to a reference assay performed
in the absence of ARSA.

In Situ Hybridization and Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on polyornithine-coated glass
coverslips (0.01% solution, Sigma-Aldrich Corp,
Italy) 72 hours in IMDM 10% FBS medium

and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
solution.

An antisense 598–base pair digoxigenin-
labeled oligonucleotide complementary to W-Pre
mRNA sequence and a control sense sequence
were produced .The in situ protocol was modified
from (46). Cells were treated with prehybridiza-
tion protocol and incubated overnight at 37°C with
0.5 mg/ml probe. The probe was detected by sheep
anti Digoxigenin 1:500 (Roche Applied Science,
Penzberg, Germany) overnight 4°C.

Immunofluorescence on ARSA-hemagglutinin
(HA) (9)–transduced Hela cells and on patients’
and healthy donors’ PB cells or HeLa cells was
performed overnight at 4°C by using rabbit anti–
Human Lamp1 1:100 (Abcam), goat anti–Human
ARSA 1:50 (Abnova), and/or rat anti-HA 1:100
(Roche Applied Science). Secondary antibodies
were incubated 1:500 for 1 hour at RT as follows:
donkey anti–sheep Alexa488, donkey anti–goat
Alexa546, donkey anti–rat Alexa488, and donkey
anti–rabbit Alexa647. Nuclei were counterstained
with 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were
acquired with Leica (Solms, Germany) TCS SP2
laser scanning confocal with 63× oil objective.
Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− Mice Transplantation and
Engraftment Evaluation
Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− mice were obtained from the Cen-
tral Institute for Experimental Animals, Nogawa,
Japan and maintained in our animal facility ac-
cording to approved protocols. Three-day-old mice
were sublethally irradiated (40,000 mGy/m2) 24
hours before intravenous injection of untransduced
and unmanipulated or transduced CD34+ cells.
Eight to 12 weeks after the transplantation, mice
were killed and hematopoietic organs (bone mar-
row, spleen, and thymus) were collected after
intracardiac PBS perfusion and processed for
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) anal-
ysis. All procedures were performed according to
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute
(IACUC #325) and communicated to the Minis-
try of Health and local authorities according to
Italian law.

Flow Cytometry
Patients’ samples—subpopulation analysis
From each sample, 5000 cells were washed and
resuspended in blocking buffer (PBS with 5%
FBS 2% BSA Fc Block 1:100), then 1 ml of
the following human-specific conjugated antibo-
dies were added: APC-conjugated anti-CD56,
PE-conjugated anti-CD34, anti-CD13 and anti-
glycophorinA, TC-conjugated anti-CD19, and anti-
CD3, FITC-conjugated anti-CD15 and anti-CD61,
PB-conjugated anti-CD14 under unstained con-
trol (DAKO, Denmark; BD-Pharmigen, Europe).
Rag2−/− IL2rg−/− mice—engraftment evaluation
From each sample, 250,000 cells were washed
and resuspended in blocking buffer (PBS with
5% FBS 2% BSA Fc Block 1:100), then 0.5 ml of
the following human-specific conjugated anti-

bodies were added: APC-conjugated anti-CD45,
PE-conjugated anti-CD34, anti-CD13, anti-CD4,
anti-CD11b and TC-conjugated anti-CD19, anti-
CD8, anti-CD3 under control of relative IgG iso-
type control (DAKO; BD-Biosciences).

After 20 min on ice, cells were washed,
resuspended in PBS 2% FBS, 1% PFA for cy-
tometric analysis. Of 100,000 events, 3000 were
acquired with FACS Canto II (BD-Biosciences,
Europe) and then analyzed by FlowJo (TreeStar,
Ashland, Oregon). During quadrant analysis, only
fluorescence that excluded >99.9% of isotype con-
trol events was considered to be specific.
