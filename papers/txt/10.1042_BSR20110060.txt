Synopsis
NF1 (neuroﬁbromatosis type I) is a common genetic disease that affects one in 3500 individuals. The disease is
completely penetrant but shows variable phenotypic expression in patients. NF1 is a large gene, and its pre-mRNA
undergoes alternative splicing. The NF1 protein, neuroﬁbromin, is involved in diverse signalling cascades. One of
the best characterized functions of NF1 is its function as a Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein). NF1 exon 23a is
an alternative exon that lies within the GAP-related domain of neuroﬁbromin. This exon is predominantly included in
most tissues, and it is skipped in CNS (central nervous system) neurons. The isoform in which exon 23a is skipped
has 10 times higher Ras-GAP activity than the isoform in which exon 23a is included. Exon 23a inclusion is tightly
regulated by at least three different families of RNA-binding proteins: CELF {CUG-BP (cytosine-uridine-guanine-binding
protein) and ETR-3 [ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision)-type RNA-binding protein]-like factor}, Hu and TIA-1 (T-cell
intracellular antigen 1)/TIAR (T-cell intracellular antigen 1-related protein). The CELF and Hu proteins promote exon
23a skipping, while the TIA-1/TIAR proteins promote its inclusion. The widespread clinical variability that is observed
among NF1 patients cannot be explained by NF1 mutations alone and it is believed that modiﬁer genes may have a
role in the variability. We suggest that the regulation of alternative splicing may act as a modiﬁer to contribute to the
variable expression in NF1 patients.

Key words: CUG-BP and ETR-3-like factor (CELF), genetic modiﬁer, Hu protein, neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1), T-cell

ALTERNATIVE SPLICING

With the realization that the human genome contains far fewer
genes than initially predicted, it is clear that complex molecular
mechanisms must exist to increase the coding capacity of our
genome. One of the major mechanisms is alternative splicing. It
allows functionally distinct proteins to be generated from a single
gene by selectively including or skipping particular exons in ma-
ture mRNA messages, which encode proteins. With recent tech-
nological advances, such as high-throughput sequencing, which
allow large volumes of the genome to be interrogated, it is now
accepted that alternative splicing is the general rule in humans
with as many as 92–94 % of human genes predicted to undergo
this process [1,2]. Alternative splicing is important in develop-

ment, in establishing and maintaining tissue speciﬁcity, and in
the development and progression of human diseases. Alternative
splicing is a highly regulated process in which both cis-acting
elements, parts of the RNA itself, and trans-acting factors, RNA-
binding proteins, interact to inﬂuence the decision of whether a
particular alternative exon will be included or skipped. Altern-
ative splicing regulation and the factors involved in this process
have been reviewed extensively by others [3–8].

Alternative splicing is important in the development and pro-
gression of human diseases. In fact, current estimates suggest
that up to 60 % of disease-causing mutations affect splicing [9].
These mutations can affect cis-acting elements, or they can lead
to the mis-regulation of trans-acting splicing factors. Mutations
that affect splicing can lead to an alteration in the levels of cor-
rectly spliced transcripts, or they can disrupt the normal levels

of protein isoforms created by alternative splicing. Several hu-
man diseases are known to be caused by mutations that lead to
aberrant splicing, including DM (myotonic dystrophy), spinal
muscular atrophy and certain cancers [9–12]. Recently, it has
been proposed that splicing may have a role as a genetic modiﬁer
of single-gene human diseases. Splicing can play this role by
altering either the normal levels of correctly spliced RNA tran-
scripts or the normal ratios of different isoforms that result from
alternative splicing [13,14].

One documented example of a human disease in which splicing
acts as a genetic modiﬁer is CF (cystic ﬁbrosis). CF is a relatively
common autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which the CFTR
(CF transmembrane conductance regulator) gene is mutated [15].
So far approximately 1000 CF disease-causing mutations have
been identiﬁed in the CFTR gene [16]. Many CF patients, even
from the same family, show differences in the presentation or
severity of the CF phenotype, which argues for a role for genetic
modiﬁers in the disease severity. Splicing is believed to act as
a genetic modiﬁer of CF severity. Several characterized splicing
mutations in the CFTR gene itself lead to the complete loss of
correctly spliced transcripts, while other known CFTR mutations
lead to an alteration in the levels of the correctly spliced products
[15]. CF patient studies have shown that lower levels of correctly
spliced transcripts correlate with a more severe pulmonary system
phenotype [15]. Interestingly, patients who carry the same muta-
tions do not have the same levels of correctly spliced transcripts,
and therefore modiﬁer genes are implicated in contributing to CF
disease severity [15].

NF1 (NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE I)
DISEASE

NF1 disease, also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a
prevalent human genetic disease that affects approximately 1
in 3500 individuals without regard to ethnicity or sex [17,18].
NF1 is the result of loss-of-function mutations to the NF1 gene,
and the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion
[19]. The disease is completely penetrant. Certain phenotypic
characteristics are considered to be hallmarks of NF1 disease, as
they occur in the majority of patients by the onset of adulthood.
These phenotypic hallmarks include Lisch nodules of the eye,
caf´e au lait spots, auxiliary freckling and the presence of benign
neuroﬁbromas [20].

Neuroﬁbromas are one of the deﬁning characteristics of NF1
disease. Neuroﬁbromas are benign tumours that involve Schwann
cells, ﬁbroblasts, perineurial cells and mast cells, and they arise
from nerve sheath cells [21]. Although being benign tumours,
neuroﬁbromas can cause serious complications in NF1 patients,
such as spinal cord compression, other neurological problems
and cosmetic burden. It is believed that NF1 functions as a tu-
mour suppressor and that neuroﬁbromas develop when both NF1
alleles are disrupted and, thus, functional neuroﬁbromin is not

present. Biallelic NF1 inactivation follows Knudsen’s Two Hit
hypothesis, where one mutated allele is either inherited or is the
result of a de novo mutation, and the second NF1 allele is then
mutated or disrupted in somatic cells in which tumours develop.
This idea is supported by the loss of both copies of the gene in
NF1-associated tumours which was ﬁrst shown in a malignant
tumour tissue from an NF1 patient [22]. Serra et al. [23], who
developed a culture technique that allowed them to look at pure
cultures of Schwann cells, showed that the Schwann cells which
are present in neuroﬁbromas are the cells that harbour the somatic
NF1 mutation in neuroﬁbromas.

Although NF1 shows complete penetrance, there is a high de-
gree of variability in the presentation of the disease. To date more
than a 1000 NF1 gene mutations have been identiﬁed [24], yet
the mutations alone cannot account for the phenotypic variability
that is seen in NF1 patients. A recent study of monozygotic twins
with NF1 disease supports the notion that phenotypic differences
exist not only in family members with similar mutations but also
in individuals who have inherited the same NF1 germ line muta-
tions [25]. The fact that these twins do show discordant pheno-
types for many of the NF1 clinical features suggests that somatic
cell mutations affecting other genes could be responsible for the
variability that is observed. Even though there are certain aspects
of the NF1 phenotype that are common to most patients, there are
some characteristics that vary in different individuals. Some of
the variable characteristics of the NF1 phenotype are cardiovas-
cular involvement, the development of plexiform neuroﬁbromas
and/or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, learning dis-
abilities, skeletal dysplasia, macrocephaly, short stature and optic
pathway gliomas [20,26].

Learning disabilities, which vary among NF1 patients, are
considered to be among the most difﬁcult aspects of the disease
for patients to manage. Current data suggest that as many as 30–
65 % of people with NF1 have speciﬁc learning deﬁcits [18,27–
29]. In general, most NF1 patients with learning difﬁculties show
visuospatial, language and reading deﬁcits, but global cognitive
impairments are not common [26,30,31]. Although one study
in monozygotic twins by Rieley et al. [25] has shown a high de-
gree of concordance for presentation of IQ (intelligence quotient)
scores, speech disorders and learning disabilities in twins with
NF1, others have shown that phenotypic differences in learning
exist in both human and animal subjects [32,33].

The widespread clinical variability that presents itself in NF1
patients leads to the hypothesis that other factors must be at play
in modulating the NF1 disease phenotype. In fact, a recent family-
based association study, by Sabbagh et al. [34], was utilized to
investigate the normal NF1 allele and its potential role in pheno-
type variability. The study examined 750 French NF1 patients
from 275 different families by looking at phenotypic correlations
between affected relatives for 12 different NF1 clinical features.
The clinical features included the number and size of caf´e au
lait spots, the number of cutaneous, subcutaneous and plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, the presence of Lisch nodules and blue-red mac-
ules, skin-fold freckling, scoliosis, neoplasms and learning dis-
abilities [34]. The ﬁndings of Sabbagh et al. [34] demonstrated
that there is a strong genetic component for 11 of the 12 traits that

they examined, and that there was no apparent inﬂuence from the
identiﬁed NF1 mutation in each family. Additional analysis of the
normal NF1 allele showed that there was not much involvement
of this allele in the differences observed in clinical presentation.
Overall, these ﬁndings support a strong argument for the involve-
ment of genetic modiﬁers that are not linked to the NF1 locus in
NF1 disease variability [34].

NF1 GENE AND PROTEIN

Human NF1 is a large gene, spanning approximately 280 kb of
genomic DNA, and is located on chromosome 17q11.2 [35,36].
The full-length human NF1 mRNA transcript contains 57 con-
stitutive exons and three alternative exons (see below). For
the purpose of this review, we will use the accepted NF1 leg-
acy numbering system for exons. For clarity, when introducing
an exon we will include the consecutive exon numbering sys-
tem in parentheses based on the GenBank® reference sequence
NM_001042492.2. The major protein product encoded by the
NF1 gene, termed neuroﬁbromin, consists of 2818 amino acids
[37]. Neuroﬁbromin is ubiquitously expressed with enrichment
in neurons, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, leuco-
cytes and adrenal medulla and it is highly conserved among
species [38–44].

The neuroﬁbromin protein is essential in mammals. Studies
in mice in which the NF1 protein is completely deleted result
in embryonic lethality between embryonic days 12.5 and 13.5
due to cardiovascular defects, and they also exhibit endocardial
cushion defects and a failure of the neural tube to close properly
[45]. Importantly, NF1 and its downstream targets are highly
conserved among different species, including mice and humans.
Presumably due to its large size, the NF1 gene is one of the
most highly mutated genes in the human genome. Comprehensive
mutation analysis showed that 27 % of NF1 mutations affect pre-
mRNA splicing [24].

The large NF1 protein is involved in diverse signalling cas-
cades [46,47]. Several functional domains of the protein have
been identiﬁed. The CSRD (cysteine- and serine-rich domain)
domain of NF1 is enriched with the amino acids cysteine and ser-
ine, and it is encoded by exons 11 (15)–17 (22) [47] (Figure 1A).
This domain has been shown to increase the association of neuro-
ﬁbromin with actin upon its phosphorylation [47–51]. Located
within the CSRD domain is a MAP (microtubule-associated pro-
tein) domain [47–49] (Figure 1A). Other domains of the NF1
protein are the caveolin-1 binding domains, which are encoded
by exons 28 (37)–33 (42). These domains are believed to be in-
volved in the formation of a complex between neuroﬁbromin and
caveolin-1, and the complex is potentially involved in the regu-
lation of several important signalling molecules including PKC
(protein kinase C) and p21ras [47,52].

The best-characterized functional domain of neuroﬁbromin is
the Ras-GRD (GTPase-activating protein-related domain), which
is encoded by exons 21 (27)–27a (35) (Figure 1). The Ras-
GTPase domain shares similarity with the catalytic domain of

mains and alternative exons

the yeast IRA-1 (inhibitory regulatory protein 1) and IRA-2 (in-
hibitory regulatory protein 2) proteins as well as the mammalian
GAP (GTPase-activating protein), and accounts for approxim-
ately 10 % of the entire protein [47]. Several groups have demon-
strated that the GRD of neuroﬁbromin has Ras-GAP activity
in vitro and in vivo [53–56]. The NF1 GRD imparts tumour
suppressor function to the NF1 protein since it exerts negative
controls on the oncogene Ras, resulting in decreased cellular
proliferation and growth. GAPs, like neuroﬁbromin, function by
accelerating the conversion of active GTP-bound Ras into inact-
ive GDP-bound Ras. Aberrant activation of Ras is associated with
many human malignancies [57].

Another NF1 protein domain that has recently been character-
ized is the Sec14-PH [Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphatidylin-
ositol transfer protein-like domain/PH (pleckstrin homology)-
like domain] module, as shown in Figure 1(A). This module, ﬁrst
identiﬁed by D’Angelo et al. [58] using structural proteomics,
features a Sec14p-like domain that is located at the C-terminal
end of the NF1 GRD and a PH-like domain that is in close as-
sociation with the Sec14p-like portion of the domain. In other
proteins, Sec14-like domains help to shuttle lipids between dif-
ferent cellular compartments within the aqueous environment;
thus it is hypothesized that the NF1 Sec14-like domain performs
a similar task [46,59–61]. The other portion of this NF1 mod-
ule, the PH domain, is believed to communicate closely with the
Sec14p-like domain through a linker region. In other proteins, PH
domains provide a structural scaffold that enables different kinds
of ligands to bind to the host protein, and in NF1 it is believed
that the interaction between the Sec14 and PH domains regulates
ligand binding to the Sec14 portion of the module [46,58,62–
64]. Recently, research effort has been put forth to determine the
binding partners of the NF1 Sec14-PH module. This work has
revealed that the NF1 Sec14-PH module binds to glycerophos-
pholipids, speciﬁcally (3-sn-phosphatidyl)-ethanolamine and 1-
(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol [46,62].

NF1 ALTERNATIVE SPLICING

The NF1 pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing. Although
some alternative splicing events are the results of mutations, the
focus of this review will be on naturally occurring splice variants.
Three alternative exons that do not alter the reading frame
of NF1 have been identiﬁed in humans and rodents, including
9a/9br, 23a and 48a (Figure 1B) [65–68]. Alternative exon 9a/9br
adds 10 amino acids to the transcript, and its inclusion seems to
be restricted to the CNS (central nervous system) [42,65,69]. The
inclusion of the 9a/9br exon does not appear to affect the function
of the GRD. The alternative exon 48a adds 18 amino acids to the
transcript. The expression of NF1 exon 48a is highest in both
fetal and adult cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues [68]. Although
its function is still under investigation, it is believed that exon 48a
might have a role in the development and differentiation of heart
and skeletal muscles [66,70]. Additionally, the inclusion of exon
48a does not appear to affect the GRD. The main focus of this
review will be on NF1 exon 23a, which will be more thoroughly
discussed later in the text.

Exon 23b is a rodent-speciﬁc alternative exon, which when
included causes a frameshift that inserts a premature stop codon
[72]. The introduction of the stop codon causes the truncated
protein to lack much of its GRD. The Nf1 isoform that includes
exon 23b but lacks exon 23a (31) is enriched in the testes of both
rats and mice [70,72].

NF1 EXON 23A AND ITS BIOLOGICAL
IMPORTANCE

The ﬁrst two NF1 isoforms that were identiﬁed, types I and II,
have the alternative exon 23a (31) skipped and included respect-
ively. NF1 exon 23a (31) is an alternative exon that lies within
the GRD of neuroﬁbromin. Exon 23a is considered to be one of
the most interesting NF1 alternative exons, due to both its loc-
ation within the GRD and the observation that the two protein
isoforms differ in their abilities to control Ras signalling. The in-
clusion of exon 23a inserts 21 amino acids between constitutive
exons 23-II (30) and 24 (32). Exon 23a is differentially spliced
in a tissue-speciﬁc manner (Figure 2A). Exon 23a is predomin-
antly included in most tissues and predominantly skipped in CNS
neurons. Although the NF1 isoform that includes exon 23a still
functions as a Ras GAP, in vitro studies have shown that it is
approximately 10 times weaker in regulating Ras signalling than
the isoform in which exon 23a is skipped. Exon 23a adds basic
amino acids, which signiﬁcantly change the structure of the NF1
GAP-related domain, and thus weaken its ability to regulate Ras
[67,73].

In 2001, Costa et al. [74] sought to better understand the
biological importance of NF1 exon 23a, so they generated a
mouse model in which exon 23a is deleted in all tissues. Un-
like the mouse model in which Nf1 is completely deleted, the

stream of exon 23a indicated by a textured rectangle. TIA-1 and TIAR
proteins promote exon 23a inclusion by competing with Hu proteins for
binding of the downstream sequence element. CELF proteins promote
skipping of exon 23a by binding UG-rich elements upstream.

mice are viable and develop normally. Although
these mice do not exhibit a tumour phenotype, they do show
differences in spatial learning and memory when tested by the
Morris water maze and another hippocampal-dependent assay
[74]. These ﬁndings suggest that it is necessary to have a balance
between the two NF1 isoforms which either contain or skip exon
23a.

REGULATION OF NF1 EXON 23A
INCLUSION

Our laboratory has put a great deal of research effort into
elucidating the regulatory mechanisms that govern NF1 exon
23a inclusion. It is common for alternative exons to be under
tight regulation by a combination of different protein factors.
The inclusion of NF1 exon 23a is tightly regulated both

Alternative splicing of the neuroﬁbromatosis type I pre-mRNA

developmentally and in speciﬁc tissues, and it has been determ-
ined that this alternative splicing event is under complex control.
To date two families of proteins that act as negative regulators of
this system by promoting exon 23a skipping and another family of
proteins, which promotes inclusion, have been identiﬁed. There
are at least two families of proteins, Hu proteins and the CELF
{CUG-BP (cytosine-uridine-guanine-binding protein) and ETR-
3 [ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision)-type RNA-binding
protein] like factors}, which promote exon 23a skipping [75,76]
(Figure 2B). Both of these protein families are highly expressed in
the brain, where exon 23a is predominantly skipped [75,77–80].
TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen 1) and TIAR (TIA-1-related
protein) are positive regulators, which promote NF1 exon 23a
inclusion [76].

TIA-1 and TIAR proteins have been shown to promote exon
23a inclusion. The Hu proteins and the TIA-1 and TIAR pro-
teins engage in a competition for binding of a U-rich sequence
downstream of NF1 exon 23a, and the competition is decided
depending on which factors are present at higher levels in a par-
ticular tissue. In vitro studies using nuclear extracts have shown
that TIA-1 and TIAR promote exon 23a inclusion, by binding
to the downstream U-rich site and increasing the binding of the
(cid:3)
U1 and U6 snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) at the 3
splice site [76].

A ROLE FOR ALTERNATIVE SPLICING
IN NF1 PHENOTYPIC VARIABILITY?

There are four members in the Hu protein family, HuR, HuB,
HuC and HuD. HuR is expressed ubiquitously, while HuB, HuC
and HuD are brain-speciﬁc family members [80]. Hu proteins are
RNA-binding proteins with diverse molecular functions, includ-
ing roles in mRNA stability, cellular stress response and alternat-
ive splicing [81]. Hu proteins bind to AU- or U-rich sequences on
RNA. Currently, there are four documented Hu protein-mediated
alternative splicing events, which include Fas exon 6, HuD exon
6, the Ikaros isoforms and NF1 exon 23a [82–86]. Hu proteins
exert their effects as negative regulators by binding to AU-rich
sequences, which function as ISS (intronic splicing silencers),
upstream and downstream of NF1 exon 23a. In vitro analyses
have shown that, at the downstream site, Hu proteins block the
binding of the critical splicing machinery components, U1 and
(cid:3)
splice site [76]. Hu proteins also inhibit the binding
U6 to the 5
of critical splicing components upstream of this regulated exon.
Zhu et al. [76] have shown that Hu proteins decrease the binding
of the splicing factor, U2AF65 (U2 auxiliary factor large subunit)
at the 3

splice site of the upstream intron.

(cid:3)

There are six CELF protein family members: CUG-BP1, ETR-
3/CUG-BP2, CELF3, CELF4, CELF5 and CELF6. CELF family
members 3–6 are considered to be brain-speciﬁc, while CUG-
BP1 and ETR-3 are widespread with enrichment in the brain
[77–79]. The CELF proteins are well-established regulators of
alternative splicing [78,79,87]. CELF proteins bind to UG-rich
cis-sequences on RNA [87,88]. The CELF proteins are closely
related to the Hu proteins, as all of the proteins share the com-
mon structure of three RNA recognition motifs and a hinge
domain. In our laboratory, we have shown that the CELF pro-
teins promote exon 23a skipping by binding to the UG-rich ele-
ments upstream of NF1 exon 23a. Although the speciﬁc cis-
elements responsible for CELF protein-mediated splicing regu-
lation have not been elucidated, in vitro binding assays suggest
that the binding sites are located upstream of exon 23a [75].
Although all of these family members promote exon 23a skip-
ping, CELF6 is a weaker regulator [75], presumably due to dif-
ferences in its amino acid composition and/or cellular localiz-
ation, which have been characterized by others [79]. In vitro
UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation experiments have shown
that recombinant CUG-BP1 competes with endogenous U2AF65,
a critical component of the splicing machinery, in HeLa cell
nuclear extracts [75].

As discussed above, the phenotypic variability seen in NF1 pa-
tients cannot be explained solely by NF1 gene mutations. Many
researchers have hinted at the idea of genetic modiﬁers for this
mice from different genetic
disease, particularly since Nf1
backgrounds show differences in phenotype severity with re-
gards to the learning and behavioural aspects of the phenotype,
as well as the differences in the susceptibility to form astrocyt-
omas [89,90]. An intriguing hypothesis is that a change in the
levels of protein isoforms generated via pre-mRNA alternative
splicing could act as a genetic modiﬁer in NF1 as it does in other
diseases such as CF.

Although it is unlikely that the NF1 patient tumour phen-
otype, which results from the loss of both copies of NF1, is
strongly affected by the action of alternative splicing regulation
as a genetic modiﬁer, such a mechanism could become import-
ant for aspects of the NF1 phenotype that are due to the haplo-
insufﬁciency of neuroﬁbromin. Two interesting examples of as-
pects of the NF1 phenotype which are thought to be due to neur-
oﬁbromin haploinsufﬁciency are vascular disease and cognitive
impairment.

An important variable aspect of the NF1 phenotype, which
has come under closer scrutiny in recent studies, is vascular
disease. It has been suggested that vascular disease is a ma-
jor cause of mortality in young NF1 patients, but even so very
few patients are routinely screened for this aspect of the disease
[91,92]. One group has reported that juvenile NF1 patients who
underwent brain MRIs showed a number of cerebrovascular sys-
tem abnormalities including narrowing of vessels and aneurysms

[93]. Much has been learned about vasculopathy using Nf1
mice as models of Nf1 haploinsufﬁciency. These heterozygous
mice have an increased risk of developing tumours, and they ex-
hibit speciﬁc learning deﬁcits [33,94]. One study by Lasater et al.
and wild-type
[95] focused on neointima formation in Nf1
controls with mechanical carotid artery injuries. Neointimas
are newly formed or thickened inner linings of blood vessels,
which commonly occur after tissue injury. The study showed
that there was increased neointima formation in response to the
injuries in the heterozygous mice compared with the wild-type
controls [95]. More recently, the same group has determined
that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in mouse BMDCs (bone

marrow-derived cells) is necessary and sufﬁcient to bring about
neointima formation [96]. In addition to being prone to neoin-
tima formation upon arterial injury, there is evidence of vas-
mice. Interestingly, peripheral
cular inﬂammation in Nf1
blood samples from human NF1 patients also show evidence of
chronic inﬂammation with increased levels of circulating mono-
cyte cells compared with unaffected controls [96]. It has been
established that VSMCs (vascular smooth muscle cells) that lack
neuroﬁbromin proliferate and migrate more readily than control
cells in response to PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and
this is believed to be due to the hyperactivation of the Ras-ERK
(extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway [97].

The learning disability phenotype for NF1 patients has pro-
found implications for the management of the disease. The
mouse has learning disabilities, which appropriately
Nf1
mimic the human learning and behaviour phenotypes, suggest-
ing that these aspects of the phenotype are due to neuroﬁbromin
haploinsufﬁciency. The mouse model fails at tasks that parallel
attention deﬁcits and visual–spatial deﬁcits in NF1 patients [31].
Another model of the learning disabilities phenotype is the Nf1
mouse. The mouse model shows that it is import-
exon 23a
ant to have the right balance of the two isoforms (types I and II)
during development, since this animal lacks exon 23a and has a
learning phenotype.

It is possible that alteration of alternative splicing could have
a role as a genetic modiﬁer of the severity of vascular disease
and learning in NF1 patients. Speciﬁcally the regulation of NF1
exon 23a could play an important role. Like other alternative
exons, exon 23a is characterized by the presence of weak con-
sensus sequences, surrounding the exon, which are not readily
recognized by the splicing machinery, and, as mentioned above,
there are many regulatory factors involved in the regulation of
exon 23a inclusion or skipping. Although they have not yet been
identiﬁed, it is possible that mutations that affect the cis-acting
elements around exon 23a could result in the failure of import-
ant trans-acting factors to bind, and this could in turn lead to an
altered ratio of the two isoforms. Conversely, it is also possible
that mutations could exist in the genes that encode the regulatory
factors that bind to the NF1 cis-acting elements. These effects
could increase inclusion of this exon to a level that would al-
low hyperactivation of the Ras-ERK pathway in speciﬁc cells
involved in the formation of neointima in the case of the vascular
aspects of the disease. Likewise, the mutations could cause an
imbalance in the distribution of the types I and II isoforms and
lead to phenotypic variance in learning in patients.

With these concepts in mind, it is crucial to identify any addi-
tional cis-acting and trans-acting factors that regulate NF1 exon
23a inclusion. It is also of interest to further mechanistically
dissect and understand the biological importance of all of the
naturally occurring NF1 splice variants. An intriguing approach
to better understand the biological importance of these splice
variants is to use genetic techniques to generate mouse models
in which the ratio of protein isoforms is altered. Manipulation
of the alternative transcript levels in different tissues will most
likely provide new insights into why these alternative exons are
so tightly regulated in vivo.
