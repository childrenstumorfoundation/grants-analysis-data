SUMMARY

The concept that gliomas comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases distinguished by their developmental
origin raises the intriguing possibility that neural stem cells (NSCs) from different germinal zones have differ-
ential capacities to respond to glioma-causing genetic changes. We demonstrate that lateral ventricle sub-
ventricular zone NSCs are molecularly and functionally distinct from those of the third ventricle. Consistent
with a unique origin for pediatric low-grade glioma, third ventricle, but not lateral ventricle, NSCs hyperpro-
liferate in response to mutations characteristic of childhood glioma. Finally, we demonstrate that pediatric
optic gliomas in Nf1 genetically engineered mice arise from the third ventricle. Collectively, these observa-
tions establish the importance of innate brain region NSC heterogeneity in the patterning of gliomagenesis
in children and adults.

INTRODUCTION

The importance of the cell of origin in tumorigenesis and clinical
behavior of brain tumors (Singh et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2005)
has been strengthened by the observation that histologically
identical brain tumors are composed of molecularly distinct
subtypes that reﬂect their progenitor cell of origin (Gibson
et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2010; Kalamarides et al., 2011;
Sharma et al., 2007). These ﬁndings suggest that brain tumors
with distinct cellular origins are unique diseases with different
growth control
regulatory networks, genetic changes, and
responses to therapy. Consistent with this, we have shown
that mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) from the brainstem, but
not the neocortex, exhibit increased proliferation and gliogenesis
following inactivation of the neuroﬁbromatosis-1 (NF1) tumor
suppressor gene (Lee et al., 2010). This differential sensitivity
to Nf1 loss closely parallels the propensity for pilocytic astrocy-
tomas (PAs) in children with NF1 to form within the optic pathway
and brainstem, but rarely in the cortex (Guillamo et al., 2003). A
similar geographic pattern of gliomagenesis is observed for
sporadic pediatric PAs harboring KIAA1549:BRAF fusions
(Jacob et al., 2009), which predominantly form in the cerebellum.
Within the brain there are several germinal zones potentially
germane to brain tumorigenesis, including the subventricular

zone of the lateral ventricle (lv-SVZ), the third ventricle (TVZ),
and the fourth ventricle (Quin˜ ones-Hinojosa et al., 2006; Weiss
et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2005). Although the lv-SVZ is often consid-
ered to be the likely stem cell compartment for cerebral hemi-
sphere glioma formation in mice following the introduction of
genetic alterations observed in high-grade human adult gliomas
(Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009; Jacques et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2009), other populations, including NG2+ cells (Assanah et al.,
2006; Masui et al., 2010) and oligodendrocyte precursors (Liu
et al., 2011; Sugiarto et al., 2011), can serve as potential cells
of origin for malignant glioma. However, to our knowledge, the
origin of optic glioma, the second-most common low-grade
pediatric glioma, remains unresolved. Based on the proximity
of the optic nerve/chiasm to the TVZ and that optic nerve oligo-
dendrocyte precursors can originate from the TVZ (Ono et al.,
1997), we hypothesized that TVZ may be the progenitor com-
partment for these pediatric brain tumors.

RESULTS

NSCs from the lv-SVZ and TVZ Are Molecularly Distinct
Populations
We obtained several lines of evidence supporting that TVZ is
a true stem cell niche. First, cells lining the TVZ in the embryonic

Signiﬁcance

Whereas some adult malignant cerebral hemispheric gliomas have been shown to arise from neural stem or progenitor cells
residing in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (lv-SVZ), to our knowledge, the cellular origin of pediatric low-grade
gliomas is unknown. Consistent with the propensity for childhood gliomas to develop in the optic nerve and chiasm, we
demonstrate that third ventricle (TVZ) NSCs are molecularly and functionally distinct from their lv-SVZ counterparts and
are the likely cell of origin for murine low-grade optic gliomas. These ﬁndings establish brain region NSC heterogeneity
as a major determinant underlying the patterning of gliomagenesis in children and adults.

Cntn1 expression was higher in the ante-
rior forebrain/lv-SVZ region relative to the
hypothalamus/TVZ region (Figure S1B). A
subset of these genes was also similarly
differentially expressed in older mice
(Figures S1B and S1C). Together, these
data demonstrate that TVZ and lv-
SVZ contain molecularly distinct NSC
populations.

lv-SVZ and TVZ NSCs Exhibit
Unique Cell-Autonomous
Responses to Glioma-Causing
Genetic Mutations
To determine whether TVZ and lv-SVZ
NSCs exhibit different
responses to
glioma-associated genetic events, we
measured NSC proliferation in response
to KIAA1549:BRAF expression, a repre-
sentative pediatric glioma-causing ge-
netic change (Jones et al., 2008), PTEN
loss, a representative adult glioma-caus-
ing genetic change (Pollack et al., 2006),
and p53 loss, which occurs in both adult and pediatric gliomas
(Hayes et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2010). The KIAA1549:BRAF muta-
tion is found in 62% of hypothalamus/optic pathway PAs but is
uncommon in histologically identical tumors of the cerebral hemi-
spheres (14%) (Jacob et al., 2009). p53 inactivation increased
proliferation and decreased apoptosis of both lv-SVZ and TVZ
top, and Figure S1D). Pten inactivation
NSCs (Figure 2C,
increased proliferation of lv-SVZ, but not in TVZ, NSCs, whereas
KIAA1549:BRAF overexpression increased proliferation of TVZ,
but not in lv-SVZ, NSCs, with no effect in apoptosis (Figures 2C
and S1D). Decreased apoptosis was observed in both NSC pop-
ulations following Pten loss, whereas KIAA1549:BRAF overex-
pression resulted in no change. These differential responses do
not reﬂect a failure to activate AKT following Pten loss in TVZ
NSCs or MEK following KIAA1549:BRAF expression in lv-SVZ
NSCs (Figure S1E).

Mouse Nf1 Optic Gliomas Arise from TVZ
To identify the ventricular zone of origin for optic glioma, we
chose NF1 as a model experimental system because gliomas

day 15.5 (E15.5) mouse brain express NSC markers Sox2, nestin,
and BLBP, and exhibit robust proliferation (Ki67 immunostaining)
(Figure 1A). Second, TVZ NSCs can generate Sox2+, nestin+, and
BLBP+ neurospheres and undergo self-renewal, similar to their
lv-SVZ counterparts (Figure 1B). Third, dissociated single cells
from TVZ neurospheres differentiate into neurons, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocytes in vitro (Figure 1C).

We then employed gene expression proﬁling to demonstrate
that TVZ NSCs and lv-SVZ NSCs are molecularly distinct popu-
lations. Initially, E17.5 TVZ and lv-SVZ NSCs from three females
were used for the proﬁling; however, one outlier lv-SVZ NSC
sample, based on principal component analysis (PCA), was
eliminated from the following analyses (see Figure S1A available
online). Using hierarchical clustering methods, lv-SVZ and TVZ
NSCs were easily separable (Figures 2A and S1A). The differen-
tial expression of several genes was validated by quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR (Figure 2B) and by in situ hybridization
(Allen Brain Atlas at http://www.brain-map.org/): Chl1 and Slit2
expression was higher in the hypothalamus/TVZ region com-
pared to the anterior forebrain/lv-SVZ region, whereas Dcx and

predominate in the optic pathway of children with this syndrome
(Guillamo et al., 2003). Similar to human NF1-associated gliomas,
optic gliomas form in the prechiasmatic and chiasmal regions of
Nf1+/ 
mice following complete Nf1 inactivation in glial progeni-
tors (Figure 3A) (Bajenaru et al., 2003). These gliomas could arise
from NSCs in the lv-SVZ, TVZ (Figure 3B), optic nerve, or retina.

We ﬁrst excluded the retina and optic nerve as cell of origin of
these gliomas because true NSCs capable of self-renewal and
multilineage differentiation could not be generated from either
E17.5 or postnatal day (P) 1 retina cells or the optic nerve (Fig-
ure S2A; Cicero et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2010). Additionally, Cre
transgene expression (LacZ+ cells) was not detected in the retina

NSC Heterogeneity and Glioma Formation

Cancer Cell

To provide in vivo support for these in vitro observations, we in-
activated Nf1 in BLBP+ NSCs beginning at E9.5 and found that
the numbers of Olig2+ glial progenitors (Figure 3D) and GFAP+
astrocytes (Figure 3E) were increased in the TVZ, but not in the
lv-SVZ, of P8 Nf1BLBP mice compared to control
littermates
in vivo.

To examine whether human hypothalamic/optic gliomas reca-
pitulate the gene expression pattern of TVZ (Sharma et al., 2007),
PCA and hierarchical clustering revealed that hypothalamic/
optic pathway gliomas were separated from their supratentorial
counterparts (Figure S2D). Although some of the differentially
expressed genes were not represented on the human Affymetrix
Gene Chip, we found that one differentially expressed TVZ
transcript (Slit2) was signiﬁcantly higher (3.7-fold; p = 0.001) in
hypothalamic/optic PAs compared to supratentorial PAs. Two
other TVZ-overexpressed transcripts (Gmnn and Nr2f2) and
two lv-SVZ-overexpressed transcripts (Cntn1 and Apoe) also ex-
hibited increased expression in hypothalamic/optic gliomas and
respectively, although not
supratentorial gliomas,
reaching
statistical signiﬁcance,
likely due to the small sample size
(p = 0.08–0.1) (Figure S2D).

Finally, we sought to deﬁne a developmental window when
optic glioma formation is favored by virtue of the selective prolif-
erative activity of the TVZ and lv-SVZ using three different GFAP-
Cre driver lines with distinct patterns of Cre-mediated Nf1 inac-
tivation in vivo (Figures S3A and 4A). The GFAP-Cre:IRES-LacZ
strain used to generate Nf1+/ GFAP mouse optic gliomas has
detectable LacZ expression in the lv-SVZ and TVZ beginning at
E15.5 (Figure 4B). The GFAP-Cre* strain (Zhuo et al., 2001) initi-
ates Cre expression in the anterior part of forebrain by E13.5
(Figures 4A and 4C) and in the hypothalamus, which includes
the TVZ, by E16.5 (Figure 4C). Nf1+/ GFAP* mice also develop
optic glioma (Zhu et al., 2005) (Figure 4E). Analysis of the TVZ
and lv-SVZ in these mice reveals that nestin+ and Ki67+ progen-
itor cells reside in both germinal zones at E15.5 (Figure 4B).

To distinguish between these two germinal zones, we em-
ployed the GFAP-CreER strain, which was similar to the ﬁrst
GFAP-Cre strain, but expressed a tamoxifen-regulatable Cre
(CreER; Chow et al., 2008). Recombination and inactivation of
the Nf1 gene were veriﬁed by recombination PCR (Figure 4D),
whereas Cre activity in the brain, optic chiasm, and optic nerve
following tamoxifen injection was demonstrated using ROSA-
GREEN reporter mice (Figure 4D). Because lv-SVZ contained
nestin+ Ki67+ cells at P8–P14, whereas these proliferating
progenitors disappeared after P2 in TVZ (Figures 4B, S3B,
and S3C), we inactivated Nf1 either during the ﬁrst postnatal
week of life (P1–P3) or at 2 weeks of age when only the lv-SVZ
harbors signiﬁcant numbers of proliferating (Ki67+) progenitor
(nestin+) cells (Figures S3B and S3C). Nf1 loss at these times
did not result in glioma formation at 3 months of age (Figure 4E).
As an internal control for the ﬁdelity of the GFAP-CreER strain for
inducing optic glioma, we treated >20 litters of pregnant females
with tamoxifen at E16.5 (50 mg/g i.p.). The vast majority of preg-
nant dams did not deliver viable mice; however, the one embry-
onically treated pup that survived to 3 months of age developed
an optic glioma (Figure S3D) with increased numbers of Ki67+
cells and increased numbers of GFAP+ astrocytes (Figure S3E).
Taken together, these data establish that optic gliomas arise
from neural stem/progenitor cells in the proliferative TVZ during

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Mice
All strains were generated (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), main-
tained on a C57BL/6 background, and used under an approved Animal Studies
Committee protocol at Washington University.

NSC Isolation and Analysis
lv-SVZ and TVZ NSCs from Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox, p53ﬂox/ﬂox, and Ptenﬂox/ﬂox P1 mouse
pups were infected with adenovirus containing LacZ or Cre, and protein loss
was conﬁrmed by western blotting (Lee et al., 2010). NSCs expressing
KIAA1549:BRAF were generated following retrovirus infection (Peter Collins,
University of Cambridge) and veriﬁed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). pBABE-puro retrovirus was used as control. NSC prolifera-
tion and multilineage differentiation assays were performed as described
previously by Lee et al. (2010).

Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry
Tissues and cells were prepared as previously reported by Hegedus
et al. (2007) prior to staining with appropriate antibodies (Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures).

Microarray Analysis
RNA from three independent litters of E17.5 C57BL/6 lv-SVZ and TVZ
NSCs was subjected to microarray proﬁling (Supplemental Experimental
Procedures), and differentially expressed probe sets (p < 0.05; fold change
>3-fold increase or decrease) were prioritized for validation.

Quantitative Reverse-Transcription PCR
mRNA expression was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
using NSCs from independently generated litters as described previously by
Yeh et al. (2009) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

X-Gal Staining
Six micrometer frozen sections were stained with X-Gal (Gold Biotechnology,
St. Louis) (Hegedus et al., 2007).

Tamoxifen Injection and Recombination PCR
Tamoxifen was injected into lactating females (1 mg/50 ml i.p.) at P1–P3 or
P14–P18 (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), and Nf1 recombination
was determined by recombination PCR (Mayes et al., 2011).

Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as reported previously by Lee et al. (2010)
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

Statistical Analyses
Each experiment was performed with samples from at least three independent
litters. Statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) was determined (Student’s t test) using
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad).

ACCESSION NUMBERS

Human PA (GSE5675) and mouse NSC (GSE37832) microarray data
were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/).

DISCUSSION

Our ﬁnding that NSCs from two different germinal zones are
molecularly distinct stem cell populations is consistent with
previous reports examining mouse embryonic spinal cord and
brain NSCs as well as human neural progenitor cells from the
developing cortex and ventral midbrain (Johnson et al., 2010;
Kelly et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2005). In each
case the unique genetic signature reﬂects the regional identity
of the progenitors. Importantly, we show that the heterogeneity
revealed at the molecular level translates into unique functional
responses to glioma-causing genetic changes seen in children
and adults. Although, to our knowledge, the precise etiologies
for these innate differences are unknown, they likely reﬂect tran-
scriptional networks and signaling set points unique to these
brain regions. For example we have previously shown that the
expression of the mTOR component rictor underlies the ability
of Nf1-deﬁcient NSCs to increase their proliferation and glial
differentiation (Lee et al., 2010), whereas basal cAMP levels in
speciﬁc brain regions partly dictate the spatial pattern of glioma-
genesis in NF1 (Warrington et al., 2010).

We also provide several lines of converging evidence that optic
gliomas likely originate from stem/progenitor cells residing in the
TVZ. Although both TVZ and lv-SVZ germinal zones could provide
cells of origin for these tumors, only TVZ, but not lv-SVZ, NSCs
exhibit increased proliferation and gliogenesis following Nf1 inac-
tivation. In addition, optic gliomas do not form in mouse strains
following postnatal Nf1 inactivation when only lv-SVZ NSCs are
proliferating. These latter experiments also demonstrate that
Nf1 inactivation in GFAP-expressing astrocytes in young mice
does not result in optic gliomagenesis. One report employing
immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis similarly
suggested that human optic gliomas might derive from third
ventricle glial progenitors (Tchoghandjian et al., 2009). This result
parallels the developmental origins of another optic nerve glial
cell population in which oligodendrocyte precursor cells gener-
ated in the ﬂoor of the TVZ differentiate and migrate into the optic
nerve in response to signaling molecules from retinal ganglion
axons (Gao and Miller, 2006; Ono et al., 1997).

Although our mouse experimental data argue that optic
gliomas in children with NF1 arise from the TVZ, it is possible
that we have modeled only one type of human optic glioma,
and that other subtypes of optic glioma originate from different
progenitor cells akin to other CNS cancers (Gibson et al., 2010;
Johnson et al., 2010). Additional potential progenitors could be
NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells recently implicated in
malignant gliomagenesis (Assanah et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011;
Masui et al., 2010; Sugiarto et al., 2011). However, Nf1 inactiva-
tion in NG2+ cells of Nf1+/ 
mice, similar to the Nf1 mouse
models described here, is not sufﬁcient for glioma formation
(A. Solga, unpublished data). Future studies aimed at subdivid-
ing these common pediatric tumors into molecularly distinct
diseases will facilitate the development of brain tumor therapies
targeted to the speciﬁc growth regulatory pathways that drive
cell growth and differentiation in these distinct cancer-initiating
cell populations.
