The cause of the intellectual difficulties has
not been established. However, Rosman and
Pearce5 showed in a post mortem study that
patients with NF1 and intellectual impair-
ment had heterotopias in the subcortical and
deep white matter and disordered cerebral
architecture. Patients with NFI and average
intelligence had similar less severe changes
but these abnormalities were absent in con-
trol subjects. They proposed that the intellec-
tual problems were linked to migrational
abnormalities in the brain of the developing
fetus.

signal

MRI is now the investigation of choice for
visualising the distinction between grey and
white matter in the brain. Increased intensity
lesions have been detected on T2 weighted
MRI brain scans in children and young adults
with NFl. They occur predominantly in the
basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum.67-9
They do not show mass effect and do not
enhance with Gd-DTPA. The nature of the
abnormalities is uncertain, but it has been
suggested that they may be hamartomas or
slow growing gliomas. The lesions are distin-
guishable from those in multiple sclerosis and
vascular disease by their larger size and differ-
ent location. Another possibility is that these
lesions represent grey matter heterotopias.
Mirowitz et al observed that 7 of 35 patients
with NFl had increased
intensity
lesions in the basal ganglia which were more
prominent on TI than on T2 weighted MRI.
They suggested that the signal characteristics
and morphology were compatible with grey
matter heterotopias containing Schwann cells
and/or myelin.'0 Sevick et al reported that the
lesions increase in frequency in early child-
hood but tend to resolve with increasing age.9
Two recent studies have attempted to cor-
relate the presence of these lesions with learn-
ing problems in children with NFl. Duffner
et aft found increased intensity T2 weighted
lesions in 29 of 47 children and Dunn and
Roos" detected these abnormalities in 16 of
31 children. There was, however, no correla-
tion between the presence of increased inten-
sity lesions on MRI and learning difficulties
in the children studied.
As part of a larger study on intellectual
impairment in NFl, we performed brain
MRI on 38 adults and children with NFI.
We evaluated the scans for the occurrence of
general neuroradiological abnormalities and
increased intensity T2 weighted lesions. We
determined whether the presence of these T2
weighted abnormalities was age related and
scans were performed at intervals to assess

the lesions were single and were found in the
basal ganglia, cerebellum and deep white
matter adjacent to the insular cortex. Ten
patients had multiple lesions which occurred
predominantly in the basal ganglia, particu-
larly the globus pallidus (table 3, fig 1). The
lesions did not cause symptoms or neurologi-
cal deficit in any patient and did not enhance
with Gd-DTPA. However, in 2 cases the
lesions produced mass effect and distorted

the evolution of the lesions. We also consid-

Methods
We are reporting all MRI head scans carried
out on 38 patients with NF1 in our hospital
between 1987-91 are reported. These includ-
ed 32 patients from a study of 100 patients
attending our neurofibromatosis clinic and
taking part in a study of intellectual impair-
ment. The subjects included 16 children and
their ages ranged from 3-63 years (mean 25
years). Neurological and psychometric assess-
ment.

All patients had general medical and neu-
rological examinations. Twenty eight patients
had formal IQ testing with the Wechsler IQ
scales.12 13 Estimates of intellectual

MRI
MRI brain scans were carried out with a 1-5
Tesla
(Philips
Gyroscan S15, Philips Medical Systems).
Images were taken in the axial, coronal and
sagittal planes, with a slice thickness of 5 mm
to 8 mm and an interscan distance of 0-5 mm
to 0-8 mm. Ti weighted Spin Echo images
were obtained with a Repetition Time (TR)
of 500 ms and Echo Time (TE) of 20 ms. Ti
weighted scans were performed following the
administration of Gd-DTPA paramagnetic
contrast medium in 16 cases. Initially TI
Inversion Recovery sequences were used on
the first 19 patients with a TR 1500 ms, TE
30 ms and TI 300 ms to look for grey matter
heterotopias. T2 weighted Spin Echo images
were carried out using TR of 2000 ms to
3000ms and TE 50/100 ms to 20/120 ms.
Follow up scans were available
ten
patients. A Chi square test was used to assess
the relationship between the presence of
increased intensity T2 weighted abnormalities
on the scans and intellectual impairment.

Post mortem studies
A neuropathological study of two brains was
carried out. The post mortem brains were
both immersion fixed and sliced. The first
was sliced in the coronal plane and the sec-
ond case was sliced in the sagittal plane to
correspond with images taken on MRI.

Statistics
Differences between proportions were tested
with Chi squared or Fisher's exact tests and
two-tailed probabilities are quoted.

Results
Abnormalities on MRI head scans were pre-
sent in 28 of 38 patients (table 2). No grey
matter heterotopias were found in any of the
19 patients on whom Tl Inversion Recovery
sequences were used.

described

Four patients were mentally retarded with
a full scale IQ range between 51 and 67. One
of these subjects had a single increased inten-
sity T2 weighted lesion in the region of the
right
above.
Nineteen patients had an IQ in the range
70-89. Increased intensity lesions on T2
weighted images were seen in 8 of this group
and were found predominantly in the basal
ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Thirteen
patients had an IQ range 91-112. Six had
increased intensity T2 weighted lesions in the
basal ganglia, cerebellum, cerebellar pedun-
cle, and optic tract. There was therefore no
significant association between the presence
of T2 weighted lesions and intellectual
impairment (p = 0 79).

Twenty five of 38 patients had macro-
cephaly defined as
a head circumference
greater than the 98th centile. Increased inten-
sity T2 weighted lesions were present in 10 of
these patients with macrocephaly and in 3 of
the 13 with normal head circumferences.
Among the 25 patients without T2 weighted
abnormalities, 15 had macrocephaly and 10
had a normal head circumference. There was
no
relationship
between the presence of increased intensity
lesions and macrocephaly.

Post mortem studies were carried out on 2
patients, a 59 year old male whose IQ had
been 60 and a 61 year old female who had
been a lawyer. In the first case a T2 weighted
MRI scan had shown multiple high intensity
lesions in the brainstem, basal ganglia and
periventricular regions, which were consid-
ered to be infarcts, a diagnosis which was
confirmed at post mortem. The MRI of the
second patient showed multiple high signal
lesions on T2 weighted images which were
seen in the periventricular areas, pons and
cerebellum. The lesions and clinical history
were consistent with multiple sclerosis which
was verified by the neuropathological exami-
nation. No evidence of heterotopias, gliomas
or hamartomas was found in either patient.

stem and cerebellum on T2 weighted MRI

appeared to be asymptomatic. This fact, the
lack of enhancement following Gd-DTPA,
and the observation that similar lesions are
less common in adults (only being present in
5 of 22 in our series) would suggest that the
lesions are benign and might be hamartoma-
tous. However, in 2 of our cases the lesions
produced mass effect and in another 3 cases

possible there are two different types of
lesion, one which will regress and one which
may develop into a glioma. Further follow up
and rescanning of our patients should resolve
this question. In the meantime we do not

Patients need to be scanned only in accor-
dance with clinical indications. When these
lesions are encountered in NF1, patients can
be reassured that they are usually benign, but
follow up is necessary. The nature of the high

scans might be resolved by appropriate post
mortem studies.

gliomas in our series were located in the
brainstem and thalamus: the possibility arises
that they had originated in the optic tract and
that the glial tissue of the anterior and poste-
rior optic pathways has a particular potential
for gliomatous change. Four patients had
dilated ventricles and these were due to aque-
duct stenosis, a tumour impinging on the

Macrocephaly is recognised as a feature of

No differences were discovered between
the MRI scans of those patients who were
mentally retarded and those who were not,
although patients with parenchymal gliomas
showed the deterioration in cerebral function
anticipated from the sites of their lesions. A
post mortem study had shown that grey mat-
ter heterotopia was common in the brains of

patients with NFl.5 Grey matter heterotopias
have been demonstrated in the non-NF1
population with MRI scans.'5 We did not
identify any grey matter heterotopias during
the study period. However, since then we
have identified bilateral Ti weighted lesions
in the basal ganglia, similar to those described
by Mirowitz et al,'0 in one patient with a low
average IQ. We were unable to find a correla-
tion between the presence, number, size and
sites of T2 weighted abnormalities and the
occurrence of mental retardation in children
or adults. The cause of mental retardation in
NFI deserves further investigation which
might profitably be pursued with studies of
cerebral metabolism by positron emission
tomography.
We thank Dr I Janota for the post mortem examinations, Mrs
Philippa Graves for performing the MRI scans, and Professor
J Weinman for advice about the psychometric studies.
