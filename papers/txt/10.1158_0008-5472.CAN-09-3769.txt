Abstract

Current models of oncogenesis incorporate the contributions of chronic inflammation and aging to the
patterns of tumor formation. These oncogenic pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily
applicable to brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental influences
on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our laboratories have used neurofibromatosis-
1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation
to the optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize that brain region–specific
differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of
cAMP promote glioma formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where gliomas
rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by forced expression of phosphodies-
terase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular
lesions with features of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with
the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor size in Nf1 GEM in vivo.
Together, these results indicate that low levels of cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to
promote gliomagenesis, and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for glioma.

Introduction

Carcinogenesis is a complex process frequently modeled
as involving two phases, initiation and promotion (reviewed
in ref. 1). During initiation, cancer cell progenitors sustain
genetic alterations that result in loss of tumor suppressor
and/or gain of oncogene function. Cells “initiated” in this
manner possess a growth advantage through mutational
activation of proliferation and/or survival pathways. These
genetic changes are necessary, but not sufficient, for transfor-
mation. Susceptible tumor progenitors require additional sig-
nals like those derived from tissue stromal elements (e.g.,
endothelial cells, leukocytes, and fibroblasts) to complete
tumor promotion (reviewed in ref. 2). This multistage onco-
genesis model, which also involves the effects of chronic in-
flammation and aging on stromal function, has been recently

elucidated for several tumor types, including breast, gastric,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. These new insights have led to
the identification of the essential constituent stromal cell
types as well as many of the relevant pathways that mediate
the critical interactions between supportive tumor stroma
and receptive preneoplastic/neoplastic cells during tumor
evolution.

Although the prevailing model of cancer initiation and
promotion accounts for many events in the genesis of solid
tumors, it does not fully explain the unique spatial and tem-
poral pathogenesis of brain tumors, especially those in chil-
dren. Tissue stroma and inflammation differ markedly in the
brain. There are no brain fibroblasts, and immune system in-
volvement in brain cancers seems to be minimal compared
with that in peripheral tissues. Moreover, the stromal signals
that drive tumorigenesis in the brain are unique and likely
reflect the presence of spatially and temporally regulated
brain-specific cues that sculpt the developing brain during
embryogenesis and early fetal life.

Astrocytoma (glioma) formation in the common inherited
disorder neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is an excellent model
system for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechan-
isms that underlie microenvironmental contributions to
brain tumorigenesis. Similar to the initiating events in other
cancers, complete loss of Nf1 protein (neurofibromin) func-
tion is necessary, but not sufficient, for NF1-associated glio-
magenesis (3). In fact, gliomagenesis in NF1 displays such
exquisite sensitivity to the genetics, age, and region of
the surrounding brain that the necessary stroma-derived

promoting factors can be localized in both place and time.
Greater than 90% of astrocytomas in children with NF1 occur
before age 7 years, and ∼70% of these tumors involve the
optic nerves and optic chiasm (4, 5). These observations in-
dicate that the optic pathway of young children with NF1 is
uniquely conditioned to support gliomagenesis.

A specialized function of the optic pathway in gliomagen-
esis is substantiated by studies in genetically engineered
mouse (GEM) models of NF1. Neither Nf1+/− mice nor mice
with complete Nf1 loss in glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP)–expressing astroglial cells develop gliomas (3, 6).
Only mice with both reduced Nf1 gene expression (Nf1+/−
mice) in the microenvironment (“tumor microenvironment”
mice) and complete loss of Nf1 gene expression in tumor pro-
genitors (“tumor progenitor” mice) form gliomas. Although
the entire brain and the spinal cord of these mice contain
Nf1−/− glial cells within an Nf1+/− environment, tumors only
form within the optic pathway, involving the prechiasmatic
optic nerves and optic chiasm (“OPG” mice; refs. 7, 8).
Together, these GEM strains highlight a complex set of re-
quirements for gliomagenesis involving genetic events in
tumor progenitors (complete loss of Nf1), genetic events in
the microenvironment (reduced Nf1 expression; Nf1 hetero-
zygosity), and region-specific signals (the optic pathway).
Furthermore, these GEM strains afford a singular oppor-
tunity to investigate the mechanism(s) by which the tumor
microenvironment and tumor progenitors interact to pro-
mote gliomagenesis.

Previously, we showed a correlation between brain region–
specific differences in cAMP levels and glioma formation (9),
and hypothesized that low levels of cAMP constituted the
region-specific condition necessary for NF1-associated glio-
magenesis. In the current study, we experimentally test this

hypothesis and show that focal cAMP suppression, together
with global heterozygosity for neurofibromin and complete
loss of neurofibromin in tumor progenitors, is sufficient to
promote gliomagenesis in Nf1 genetically engineered mice
in vivo.

view board–approved protocol for the use of human pathol-
ogy specimens.

(mCherry)], Invitrogen (GFAP), Abcam (PDE4A and 58
kDa Golgi marker), Pharmingen (LCA), Wako (IBA-1), Cell
Signaling [phosphorylated protein kinase A (pPKA) sub-

phosphorylated CXCR4 was developed in our laboratory
and previously described (10). Antibody directed against
Olig2 (DF-308) was a gift of Dr. Charles Stiles (Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA).

Lentiviruses

Full-length murine PDE4A1 or catalytically inactive
PDE4A1-H229Q was cloned into a lentiviral packaging vector
that also encodes mCherry fluorescent protein as previously
described (11). A second packaging vector (FUW-FLG) en-
coding a fusion of firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluo-
rescent protein driven by the human ubiquitin C promoter
within an established lentiviral backbone (12) was also used
as previously described (13, 14). Viral particles were pro-
duced from each packaging vector separately by the Viral
Vectors Core Facility of The Hope Center for Neurological
Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine.

Mutagenesis

The catalytically inactive PDE4A1-H229Q (15) was gene-
rated from full-length murine PDE4A1 using a Quikchange
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and the following mutagenesis primers:

Sense: 5′-CAT GAC GTC GAC CAG CCT GGC GTC TCC

Antisense: 5′-GTT GGA GAC GCC AGG CTG GTC GAC

AAC-3′

GTC ATG-3′.

Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing; expression and
activity of catalytically active and inactive PDE4A1 con-
structs were determined first in Daoy medulloblastoma cells
(American Type Culture Collection). Daoy cells were infected
with lentivirus encoding either catalytically active or inactive
PDE4A1 as previously described (11). Cells expressing
PDE4A1 constructs were sorted and collected based on
mCherry expression by high-speed fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (MoFlo High-Performance Cell Sorter; DAKO).
As described below, expression levels were measured by
Western blot, intracellular localization by immunofluores-
cence microscopy, and effects on cAMP levels by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay.

Intracranial viral injections

Five- to seven-week-old wild-type (Nf1flox/flox), tumor pro-
genitor (Nf1flox/flox; GFAP-Cre), and OPG (Nf1flox/mut; GFAP-
Cre) mice were anesthetized [intraperitoneal ketamine
(87 mg/kg)/xylazine (13 mg/kg); Phoenix Pharmaceuticals],
the cranium was exposed, and a small hole was made
2 mm lateral and posterior to the bregma with a size 34
inverted cone burr (Dremel). Mice were positioned in a ste-
reotactic frame (Stoelting), and 500,000 transducing units

each of FUW-FLG and PDE4A1-Cherry or PDE4A1-H229Q
viruses were injected through a 27-gauge needle over
2 minutes at 3 mm below the dura mater. The incision was
closed with Vetbond (3M). A few hours after the injection
and every 12 for 48 hours thereafter, all animals received
subcutaneous
injections of 0.5 mg/kg buprenorphine
hydrochloride.

Bioluminescence imaging

In vitro. Bioluminescence of Daoy cells expressing FUW-
FLG and PDE4A1-Cherry or PDE4A1-H229Q constructs
was evaluated at the Molecular Imaging Core facility at
Washington University in St. Louis. Cells were grown in
96-well black-wall clear-bottom plates (Costar). In some ex-
periments, cells were treated with either the PDE4 inhibitor
rolipram (0–20 μmol/L) or vehicle for 18 hours. Cells were
washed and exposed to a solution of 150 μg/mL luciferin
for 10 minutes. Bioluminescence was measured using a
charge-coupled device camera–based bioluminescence imag-
ing system (IVIS 50, Caliper; exposure time 1–30 seconds, bin-
ning 8, field of view 12, f/stop 1, open filter). Data were
expressed as total photon flux (photons/s) using LivingImage
(Caliper) and IgorPro (Wavemetrics) image analysis software
packages.

In vivo. Bioluminescence measurements were obtained
48 hours after viral injection and every 2 weeks thereafter
for the subsequent 6 weeks. Hair was removed from mouse
heads with chemical depilatory agents 24 hours before imag-
ing. Images were obtained using the following parameters:
IVIS 50, Caliper; exposure time 300 seconds, binning 8, field
of view 12, f/stop 1, open filter. Images were then analyzed as
previously described (14, 16).

Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging

Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of the optic nerve were acquired as previously de-
scribed (17).

Preclinical study design

Treatment. Ten- to 12-week-old OPG mice with MRI-
confirmed optic nerve gliomas were assigned to either the
vehicle (water alone) or rolipram (5 mg/kg/d in the drinking
water; ref. 11) treatment group (5 animals per group). After
1 or 4 weeks of treatment, all animals were deeply anesthe-
tized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and optic
nerves were isolated.

Response evaluation. Response evaluations included mea-
surements of optic nerve volumes, tumor cell proliferation,
and tumor cell apoptosis (18). Optic nerve volumes were as-
sessed by measuring optic nerve diameters at the level of the
optic chiasm (D0), as well as 200 μm (D200), 400 μm (D400),
and 600 μm (D600) anterior to the chiasm. Total volume
was calculated from the sum of each 200-μm segment vol-
ume (V1 = D0 to D200) as determined using the equation for
a truncated cone:

Warrington et al.

Proliferation within normal and tumor-bearing optic nerve
was determined as the number of Ki-67–positive cells per
high-power field. Three high-power fields per specimen
were evaluated. Apoptosis was measured using terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end label-
ing (TUNEL assay, Roche Diagnostics) according to the man-
ufacturer's instructions and evaluated in a similar manner to
Ki-67 staining.

Tissue sections, immunohistochemistry, and
immunofluorescence

Tissue sections (20 μm) were cut from 4% paraformalde-
hyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded experimental brains (10). For
evaluation of mCherry, GFAP, LCA, Olig2, CNPase, pPKA sub-
strate, and IBA-1 expression, slides underwent antigen re-
trieval with Target Retrieval Solution (DakoCytomation)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary anti-
body concentrations were as follows: Dsred (mCherry,
1:200), GFAP (2.5 μg/mL), PDE4A (1:300), LCA (1:50), IBA-1
(1:1,000), 58 kDa Golgi protein (1 μg/mL), Olig2 (1:20,000),
CNPase (1:500), and pPKA substrate (1:100). With the ex-
ception of PDE4A, 58 kDa Golgi protein, and PDE4A-GFAP
costains, staining was detected using biotin-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies augmented by streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase, and visualized using either 3,3′-diaminobenzi-
dine or with the Vector VIP Peroxidase Substrate kit (DAKO).
Sections were counterstained with either hematoxylin or
methyl green (Olig2/CNPase). PDE4A, 58 kDa Golgi protein,
and PDE4A-GFAP staining was detected by immunofluores-
cence using the secondary AlexaFluor 555–conjugated and
AlexaFluor 488–conjugated secondary antibodies at a con-
centration of 1:750 (Molecular Probes) for 90 minutes. Nuclei
were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Parallel staining was performed on normal mouse
and human brain and optic chiasm autopsy specimens.
Control sections were processed identically in the absence
of primary antibody.

cAMP measurement

cAMP was measured by competitive immunoassay using a
Correlated Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Assay Designs) ac-
cording to the manufacturer's instructions and as previously
described (9). cAMP values were normalized to protein for
each sample individually.

Western blot analysis

Western blot analysis for PDE4A1 or PDE4A1-H229Q ex-
pression was performed as previously described (11). Briefly,
protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol,
and 1% Triton X-100] supplemented with protease inhibitors
(Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem 524628).
The proteins (25 mg) were resolved with 10% Bis-Tris gels
(Invitrogen) and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham) according to standard protocols.
Blots were probed with an antibody to PDE4A, followed
by incubation with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody
(LI-COR). Actin expression served as a loading control. Blots

were imaged with the Odyssey fluorescent scanning system
(Li-Cor).

Statistical analyses

Significance of induced tumor frequency was determined
with two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Comparisons were made
between the rate of tumor formation in response to PDE4A1
and PDE4A1-H229Q in each strain of mice. Differences in
cAMP levels in Daoy cells and the effect of rolipram on optic
pathway glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis were evalu-
ated by a two-tailed t test.

Results

Gliomagenesis in NF1 occurs with remarkable spatial and
temporal specificity, predominantly affecting the optic
nerves and chiasm of young children (19). This pattern of gli-
oma formation indicates that a necessary interaction occurs
between glial NF1 gene inactivation and signals present in
the optic pathway microenvironment during NF1-associated
gliomagenesis.

In prior studies involving human specimens and a GEM
model of NF1-associated optic glioma (OPG mice), we iden-
tified CXCL12 as a candidate stromal signal capable of
stimulating Nf1-deficient glial cell growth (9). Multiple
brain-derived cells within optic pathway glioma express
CXCL12, including endothelial cells (Fig. 1A), entrapped
axons, and infiltrating microglia. The presence of a functional
paracrine relationship between CXCL12-expressing stromal
elements and tumor cells is shown by the frequent presence
of the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, in a CXCL12-induced phos-
phorylated form within bipolar pilocytic cells (Fig. 1B, inset).
The potential importance of stromal activation of CXCR4 lies
in its ability to suppress intracellular levels of cAMP, which
we found was necessary for the stimulation of Nf1−/− astro-
glial cell growth (9). Moreover, we found region-specific dif-
ferences in cAMP levels in the mouse brain that correlated
with the pattern of glioma formation in NF1. The optic path-
way had the lowest, whereas the cortex had the highest
cAMP levels. Based on these observations, we hypothesized
that differences in cAMP levels underlie the distinct pattern
of gliomagenesis in NF1.

To evaluate this hypothesis in vivo, we sought to alter the
pattern of brain region–specific cAMP levels to determine
whether this would coordinately change the pattern of tumor
formation in an established GEM model of NF1 OPG. Astro-
cytomas in Nf1 GEM models share many, but not all, of the
features of human OPG. Gliomas within the optic nerves of
OPG mice (Fig. 1C) contain bipolar GFAP-positive astrocyto-
ma cells (Fig. 1D; refs. 20, 21) that also express the transcrip-
tion factor Olig2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Misexpression of
Olig2 was recently shown to be highly correlated with pilo-
cytic astrocytoma (22, 23). In addition, murine OPG exhibit
microglial infiltration reminiscent of human tumors (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1B; refs. 24–26). In contrast to human pilocytic
astrocytomas, murine tumors do not contain Rosenthal fi-
bers or eosinophilic granular bodies.

cAMP Regulates Gliomagenesis

mice. A, an optic nerve glioma specimen from a
patient with NF1 shows mild hypercellularity

tumor-associated blood vessels (e) as well as
in scattered infiltrating cells. B, serial section
from the tumor presented in A stained for the
presence of a ligand-induced phosphorylated

of receptor activation in proximity to the
CXCL12-expressing endothelium.

cells. In all cases, expression appears brown.
Scale bars, 20 μm (A and B) and 50 μm

To generate foci of decreased cAMP, we ectopically ex-
pressed lentiviral-encoded cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-
4A1 (PDE4A1; ref. 27) through stereotactic injection into the
cortex of OPG mice. PDE4A1 was chosen for these experiments
based on our prior demonstration that increased PDE4A1 ex-
pression decreased intracellular cAMP levels and enhanced
tumor growth in a xenograft model of malignant glioma in vivo
(11). The cortex was selected as the site for PDE4A1 injection
based on the following considerations, which suggest that it is
usually not a permissive microenvironment for glioma forma-
tion in NF1: (a) patients with NF1 rarely develop cortical tu-
mors; (b) glioma formation in Nf1 mouse models does not
occur in the cortex; and (c) the cortex exhibits the highest le-
vels of cAMP (9).

Catalytically active and inactive (PDE4A1-H229Q; ref. 15)
forms of PDE4A1 were cloned into a lentiviral packaging
vector also encoding for mCherry fluorescent protein (11).
In control studies, Daoy medulloblastoma cells were infected
with lentivirus encoding PDE4A1 or PDE4A1-H229Q. Where-
as both forms of PDE4A1 were equally expressed (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2A) and localized to the Golgi apparatus
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), only catalytically active PDE4A1
decreased intracellular cAMP levels (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). To mimic the low levels of cAMP normally present
within the optic pathway, we coinjected PDE4A1/mCherry
lentivirus with a second lentivirus encoding firefly luciferase
(14) into the cortex of wild-type, tumor progenitor, and OPG
mice. Bioluminescence imaging of firefly luciferase expres-

sion was used to monitor transgene expression and served
as a potential measure of neoplastic growth. In control stud-
ies, the expression of PDE4A1 or PDE4A1-H229Q in Daoy
cells, or treatment with the pan-PDE4 inhibitor rolipram,
had no effect on luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. S2D
and E).

Because wild-type mice do not develop cortical gliomas,
tumor induction following ectopic PDE4A1 expression in
wild-type mice (Nf1flox/flox) would indicate that cAMP
suppression is sufficient for glioma initiation and promo-
tion. Although tumor progenitor mice (Nf1flox/flox; GFAP-
Cre) possess occasional foci of hyperproliferating astrocytes,
they do not develop gliomas (3). PDE4A1-induced tumor
formation in these mice would occur only if suppression of
cAMP alone induced the combined tumor-promoting prop-
erties of an Nf1+/− microenvironment and the optic pathway.
Finally, cortical glioma formation in OPG mice (Nf1flox/mut;
GFAP-Cre) would suggest that cAMP suppression is
sufficient, within the context of an Nf1+/− microenviron-
ment, to bring about the neoplastic growth of Nf1−/− tumor
progenitors. PDE4A1-H229Q injections serve as controls for
noncatalytic effects of lentiviral injection and PDE4A1
overexpression.

In 51 of 58 injected mice, we detected a bioluminescent
signal, indicating successful viral transduction and transgene
expression. Increased bioluminescence imaging on serial
studies showed replication of virally infected cells. The
brain of each animal was subjected to an extensive blinded

evaluation for the presence of neoplasia according to the
algorithm outlined in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections from micro-
injected cortices were examined for common features of
neoplasia, including hypercellularity, cellular clustering, and
nuclear atypia, as well as the specific features of low-grade
glioma seen in the Nf1 OPG GEM model (Fig. 1; Supplementary
Fig. S1). Twelve of 13 OPG mice injected with catalytically
active PDE4A1 lentivirus showed increased bioluminescence
imaging and expression of mCherry fluorescent protein/
PDE4A at the injection site (Fig. 2A–C). The diagnosis of
an induced glioma was made when hypercellular lesions
expressing mCherry fluorescent protein and PDE4A also
contained GFAP-positive cells with the bipolar morphology
characteristic of tumor cells (piloid cells) commonly
found in the low-grade gliomas of NF1 patients (Fig. 2D).
Further indication of glioma was evident in increased Olig2
expression (Fig. 3A). In each case, induced tumor sites ex-
hibited greater numbers of Olig2-positive nuclei per high-
powered field than did the same location in the contralateral
cortex. As a group, the induced tumors showed significantly
increased Olig2 expression compared with the uninvolved
contralateral cortex (Fig. 3B). Comparable histologic findings
were not observed in the contralateral cortex, nor are they
observed in normal human or mouse cortex and optic nerve
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Importantly, bipolar piloid cells expressed PDE4A in a
perinuclear distribution characteristic of PDE4A1 localiza-
tion (Fig. 2D, inset), suggesting a role for PDE4A1 expression
in gliomagenesis. The mechanistic significance of this finding
was further underscored by our finding that induced tumors
had lower levels of cAMP. Because the induced tumors are
small and preclude direct cAMP measurements, cAMP levels
were inferred from an immunohistochemical analysis using a

surrogate marker, the intensity of PKA substrate phosphory-
lation. Tumor sites exhibited decreased labeling with pPKA
substrate antibody, indicating decreased PKA activity
(Fig. 3C and D) and suggestive of decreased levels of cAMP.
These findings are consistent with a relationship between
lower levels of cAMP and gliomagenesis in NF1.

In total, 41 of the 51 mice with increased bioluminescence
imaging had injection sites with evidence for exogenous
PDE4A1 or PDE4A1-H229Q expression and were deemed
evaluable for tumor formation. Eight of the 13 OPG mice
with increased bioluminescence imaging following PDE4A1
injection were considered to have induced cortical gliomas
(Table 1). This was a statistically significant rate of induced
tumor formation, as determined by Fisher's exact test (P =
0.02). In contrast, only one of seven tumor progenitor mice
and one of six wild-type mice had evidence of induced glio-
ma. None of the 15 control injections of PDE4A1-H229Q re-
sulted in a tumor. The frequency of tumor formation in
control mice was not statistically significant.

Although PDE4A (not shown) and mCherry-positive cells
(Fig. 4A) were observed at injection sites in mice without
tumors, these differed from induced tumors by the absence
of abnormal astrocyte morphologies (Fig. 4B) and their
lack of increased Olig2 expression (Fig. 4C). Disruption in
tissue architecture at these injection sites was limited to
inflammation, as evidenced by the presence of LCA-positive
cells (Fig. 4D). LCA-positive inflammatory cells were only a
minor component of the cellular constituents in the
induced tumors (data not shown). Together with our prior
studies, the pathologic features of PDE4A1-induced cortical
tumors in OPG mice show that low cAMP levels are suffi-
cient to promote glioma formation when Nf1−/− glioma
progenitors arise within the context of an Nf1+/− micro-
environment.

Figure 2. Induced tumors occur at PDE4A
injection sites. Tumors were identified in 8 of
13 OPG mice injected with catalytically active
PDE4A1. The representative images were taken
of four such induced tumors. A, induced tumors
had foci of cellular clusters and nuclear atypia
evident on hematoxylin and eosin–stained
sections. Scale bar, 25 μm. B, injection sites
were further identified as hypercellular,
disorganized lesions expressing virally encoded
mCherry fluorescent protein (brown; scale bar,
25 μm). C, PDE4A in characteristic perinuclear
localization (yellow). DAPI counterstains nuclei
blue. Scale bar, 25 μm. D, GFAP-expressing
cells (brown) display an elongated bipolar
phenotype (arrows) characteristic of pilocytic
cells. Scale bar, 50 μm. Inset, colabeling of a
piloid cell with antibodies directed against
GFAP (green) and PDE4 (red) supports the role
of PDE4A1 expression and cAMP suppression
in the genesis of glioma.

cAMP Regulates Gliomagenesis

Figure 3. Induced tumors exhibit increased
Olig2 expression and evidence for decreased
cAMP levels. A, cells within induced tumors
exhibited increased Olig2 expression. Scale
bar, 25 μm. B, the number of Olig2-positive
nuclei per high-powered field (hpf) in induced
tumors was greater than in the contralateral
cortex. **, P < 0.005 as determined by
two-tailed t test. C, immunolabeling of injection
sites with antibody directed against the
phosphorylated form of PKA substrates
revealed a high level of staining in normal cortex
(arrowhead) but low level of staining in tumor
cells (*). D, serial sections through the same
tumor site pictured in C and labeled with
antibody directed against mCherry fluorescent
protein reveal the interface between tumor (*)
and cortex (arrowhead). Scale bars, 50 μm.

To determine whether restoration of normal cAMP levels
would attenuate optic glioma growth in vivo, we treated OPG
mice for 1 or 4 weeks with rolipram or vehicle following the
detection of an optic glioma by manganese-enhanced MRI
(Fig. 5A). We previously showed that PDE4 inhibition with
rolipram blocked in vivo malignant glioma growth through
elevation of cAMP levels (11, 14). Using this preclinical para-
digm, 4 weeks of rolipram resulted in tumor regression as
measured by a restoration of optic nerve volumes to near nor-
mal values (Fig. 5B and C). Moreover, rolipram treatment sup-
pressed tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 5D), but had no effect on
tumor cell apoptosis as measured by TUNEL staining (data
not shown). These observations show that low levels of cAMP
are necessary for the maintenance of optic glioma prolifera-
tion in vivo, and further support the critical role of cAMP sig-
naling in gliomagenesis and continued tumor growth.

Discussion

Clinical observations and experimental data indicate that
cancers frequently arise within specific tissue contexts (see
ref. 2 for review). For example, gastrointestinal cancers are
often associated with chronic inflammation and senescent fi-
broblasts can promote the transformation of preneoplastic
epithelial cells (28). Prevailing models of how inflammation
and aging contribute to tumor promotion focus on the ac-
tions of fibroblast and leukocyte-derived cytokines and
growth factors. However, this model is not directly applicable
to brain tumors, as there are no fibroblasts within the central

nervous system (CNS), and chronic CNS inflammation in-
volving leukocytes is uncommon. Moreover, pediatric brain
tumors develop in the absence of the effects of aging. Never-
theless, the unique spatial and temporal distribution of brain
tumors (gliomas) in children with NF1 highlights the signif-
icant role that microenvironmental factors can play in brain
tumor formation.

Based on the natural history of patients with NF1 as well
as Nf1 GEM models (7, 29), we and others have proposed that
the milieu of the normally growing nervous system functions
similarly to aging or inflamed peripheral tissues by providing
the necessary cellular elements and growth-regulatory fac-
tors for neoplastic transformation. Thus, whereas complete
loss of neurofibromin function in glial progenitors is a
requisite initiating step in transformation, the formation of
NF1-associated mouse gliomas also requires a permissive
Nf1 heterozygous microenvironment and region-specific ef-
fectors. It is the confluence of all three of these elements—
homozygous Nf1 gene inactivation in tumor progenitors, het-
erozygous Nf1 gene inactivation in the tumor surround, and
region-specific effectors—that results in NF1-associated glio-
ma formation in the optic nerves and chiasm of young NF1
heterozygous children and mice.

Several recent studies suggest that Nf1 heterozygosity
creates a permissive microenvironment by altering the func-
tion of specific cell types that can be co-opted to promote
tumorigenesis. In the central nervous system, we showed
that Nf1 heterozygosity alters microglia function, resulting
in increased proliferation and motility, and elevated

production of growth-promoting molecules such as CXCL12
and hyaluronidase (9, 25). Similarly, peripheral nerve tumor
(neurofibroma) development requires Nf1+/− mast cells,
which are released from the bone marrow in response to
c-kit receptor activation (30).

Region-specific effects could also include region-specific
differences in cell types that participate in gliomagenesis
(31) or region-specific differences in growth-regulatory sig-
nals. Previously, we suggested CXCL12 as a candidate optic
pathway–derived glioma-promoting factor and showed that
complete loss of neurofibromin function alters CXCR4 sig-
naling, such that CXCL12 induces significant sustained sup-
pression of cAMP levels. This abnormal CXCL12-mediated
cAMP suppression creates an inappropriate survival re-
sponse in Nf1−/− astrocytes. Neither CXCL12-induced cAMP

suppression nor the resultant enhanced survival response is
observed in wild-type astrocytes (9). Collectively, these data
provide an attractive model for tumorigenesis, in which com-
plete loss of neurofibromin function not only initiates onco-
genesis but also secondarily contributes to tumor promotion
by dysregulating CXCR4-cAMP signaling. In this fashion, loss
of neurofibromin results in the acquisition of two hallmark
features of malignant transformation—hyperproliferation
and increased survival—but only when neurofibromin loss
occurs in a CXCL12-rich microenvironment, such as the op-
tic pathway of young children and mice.

The current study provides novel in vivo support for the hy-
pothesis that suppression of cAMP constitutes an important
region-specific signal for gliomagenesis in NF1. The creation
of cortical foci in which cAMP levels were suppressed

cAMP Regulates Gliomagenesis

Figure 5. Targeted inhibition of PDE4 attenuates tumor growth in OPG mice. A, optic nerve gliomas were identified by enlarged optic nerves (white areas
within the boxed region and demarcated by dotted line in inset) in OPG mice by MRI and assigned to treatment (rolipram) or control (vehicle) groups.
B, optic nerve volumes in animals treated for 1 or 4 weeks with rolipram were compared. The arrowheads indicate thickened optic nerves characteristic
of these tumors. After 4 weeks of rolipram treatment, optic nerves returned to a normal diameter. C, quantitation of optic nerve volumes indicates that there
is a statistically significant increase in optic nerve volumes in untreated mice compared with wild-type mice (WT, without tumors) and that rolipram
abrogates this difference in volume (n = 5 mice per group). D, the antitumor effect of rolipram was associated with inhibition of tumor cell proliferation
as determined by Ki67 staining and the numbers of Ki67-positive cells per high-power field (n = 5 mice per group). *, P < 0.05, difference between untreated
OPG and WT mice as determined by two-tailed t test.

rendered the cortex similar to the optic pathway and thus
susceptible to glioma. Whether CXCL12 is the primary regu-
lator of cAMP effects during spontaneous gliomagenesis
in NF1 remains unknown. Further, the critical cell type(s)
through which PDE4A1 affects gliomagenesis are not yet
identified.

Lentiviral expression of PDE4A1 could have reduced cAMP
levels in Nf1−/− glial cells, and/or other cells in the Nf1+/−
cortex, including neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells.
However, although cAMP might regulate tumor-promoting
functions in these multiple cell types, growth-regulatory ef-
fects of cAMP in tumor cells are well described. For example,
increased cAMP levels induced p38 phosphorylation and ap-
optosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (32) and en-
hanced radiation-induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells
through upregulation of Bak (33). Similarly, decreased cAMP
inhibited the function and expression of the proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family member Bim (34, 35). Consistent with cAMP
suppression functioning within glioma progenitors, our
previous studies indicated that suppression of cAMP within
Nf1−/− astroglial cells endowed them with a survival advan-
tage (9). Moreover, cAMP promotes astrocyte differentiation
(36). Thus, suppression of cAMP levels in Nf1−/− tumor
progenitors might inhibit differentiation and maintain a
progenitor-like state and, in concert with tumor-promoting
genetic and microenvironmental changes, facilitate tumori-
genesis. The current work is focused on identifying in which
cells cAMP suppression is required for gliomagenesis and

whether cAMP dysregulation in Nf1 preneoplastic cells
modulates apoptosis and/or proliferation.

Important issues also raised by these studies include the
identity of the initiated tumor progenitor cell, the down-
stream mediators of cAMP signaling in tumor promotion,
and the best way to target the cAMP pathway in the treat-
ment of gliomas. Previous studies reported that both differ-
entiated astrocytes and neural stem cells could serve as
glioma cell of origin in a model of gliomagenesis dependent
on loss of Ink4a/Arf and gain of epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor activation (37). In contrast, recent work on dermal
neurofibromas in a GEM model of NF1 suggested that only
tissue stem cells could function as tumor progenitors (38).
The cortical injections in this study did not target any spe-
cific cell population. Thus, PDE4A1-induced gliomas could
have developed from transformed differentiated astrocytes
or neural stem cells. The known ability of stem cells to exten-
sively migrate throughout the brain to sites of pathology sug-
gests that this latter possibility is a tenable hypothesis (39).
Future studies will be required to identify the cell of origin of
low-grade gliomas in Nf1 GEM.

Finally, as underscored by rolipram-mediated attenua-
tion of optic glioma growth in OPG mice (this study)
and by reduced Nf1 GEM neurofibroma size following im-
atinib-mediated c-kit pathway inhibition (30), components
of the stromal signaling pathway represent potential tar-
gets for future antineoplastic therapy. These exciting re-
sults firmly establish that the experimental tractability of

Nf1 GEM model systems offer unprecedented opportunities
to identify the cellular and molecular bases for stromal
control of tumor formation. In addition, this spontaneous
brain tumor model is an excellent platform for the devel-
opment of stroma-directed chemotherapeutic strategies.
Further, it was recently shown that 23% of high-grade glio-
blastoma tumors harbor inactivating NF1 gene mutations
(40). Thus, insights gained from the NF1 model will be in-
formative with regard to stromal contributions to and
stroma-directed therapy for other brain tumors in children
and adults.
