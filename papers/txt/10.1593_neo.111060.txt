Abstract
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an inherited predisposition cancer syndrome characterized by the development of
multiple benign tumors in the nervous system including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Using a
disease model comprising primary human schwannoma cells, we previously demonstrated that adherens junctions
(AJs) are impaired in schwannoma cells because of a ubiquitous, upregulated Rac activity. However, the mech-
anism by which loss of contact inhibition leads to proliferation remains obscure in merlin-deficient tumors. In this
study, we show that proliferative Wnt/β-catenin signaling is elevated as active β-catenin (dephosphorylated at serine
37 and threoine 41) localizes to the nucleus and the Wnt targets genes c-myc and cyclin D1 are upregulated in
confluent human schwannoma cells. We demonstrate that Rac effector p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) is essential
for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling because depletion of PAK2 suppressed active β-catenin, c-myc, and
cyclin D1. Most importantly, the link between the loss of the AJ complex and the increased proliferation in human
schwannoma cells is connected by Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor–induced tyrosine 654 phosphor-
ylation on β-catenin and associated with degradation of N-cadherin. We also demonstrate that active merlin main-
tains β-catenin and N-cadherin complex at the plasma membrane through direct regulation. Finally, we demonstrate
that phosphorylation of tyrosine 654 is critical for the increased proliferation in human schwannoma cells because
overexpression of a Y654F mutant β-catenin reduces hyperproliferation of schwannoma cells. We suggest a model
that these pathways are coordinated and relevant for proliferation in merlin-deficient tumors.

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an inherited predisposition cancer
syndrome characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors
in the nervous system including schwannomas, meningiomas, and
ependymomas. NF2 affects 1 in 30,000 people and leads to significant
medical problems, namely, substantial morbidity and reduced life
span. The tumor suppressor protein merlin, which belongs to the ezrin-
radixin-moesin (ERM) family, is the protein product of the NF2 gene.
Loss of merlin also causes sporadic tumors, namely, all schwannomas,
a proportion of ependymomas, and most meningiomas [1]. Like other
ERM proteins, merlin can form a C-terminal tail–FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin,
radixin, and moesin) interaction and switch between open and closed
conformation through changing phosphorylation status on serine 518.
Merlin localizes to the cortical cytoskeleton [2] and the nucleus [3]. At
the plasma membrane, merlin exerts inhibitory effects by regulating

growth factor receptors, integrins, and downstream signaling pathways,
for example, Rac/PAK/JNK, integrins/Src/FAK, PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and
Raf/MEK/ERK pathways [4–10]. In the nucleus, merlin suppresses
tumorigenesis by binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, inhib-
iting its activity [3].

Loss of contact inhibition is a hallmark of merlin-deficient tumors.
The potential mechanism for this has been investigated by analyzing the
relationship between merlin and Rac/PAK, CD44, Paxillin, epidermal
growth factor receptor, and other growth factor receptors [5,8,11,12].
Although a colocalization and a physical interaction between merlin
and the core members of the adherens junction (AJ) complex, namely,
cadherins and catenins, had been observed [13], it is still unclear how
merlin directly inhibits proliferation by regulating cadherins and catenins.
The Wnt signaling transduction pathway plays an important role
in tumorigenesis [14]. The stability of β-catenin, the core player of
the canonical Wnt pathway, is strictly regulated in the cell cytoplasm.
Tyrosine phosphorylation, which was detected on β-catenin in

schwannoma cells [15], is the first step of β-catenin translocation from
the AJs to the cytoplasm [16]. In the absence of Wnt signaling, a de-
construction complex comprising axin, GSK-3, and APC is formed,
leading to the proteolytic degradation of β-catenin. Nevertheless, while
Wnt is present, serine 37 and threoine 41 on cytoplasmic β-catenin are
dephosphorylated and β-catenin is shuttled into the nucleus [17]. Nu-
clear translocation of β-catenin is dependent on the phosphorylation of
Ser191 and Ser605 mediated by the active Rac1/JNK2 pathway; muta-
tions of these residues significantly affect β-catenin nuclear accumula-
tion and Wnt signaling [18]. In the nucleus, β-catenin will then interact
with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and activate Wnt
transcription target genes, for example, cyclin D1 and c-myc [14].

In a recent study, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which was measured
by the expressions of Wnt target genes and TCF activity, was found
to be significantly increased in NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibro-
blast in confluent cell cultures, which was reduced by knockdown or
inhibition of Rac1 [19]. The increase in Wnt signaling had also

been correlated with merlin deficiency in human malignant gliomas
[20]. In human primary schwannoma cells, increased activity of
Rac1/PAK/JNK [7,15,21] and colocalization of phosphorylated tyro-
sine (antibody) and β-catenin [15] prompted us to examine the fate
and roles of β-catenin and related growth factor signaling in schwannoma
cells. More importantly, the mechanism by which merlin loss leads to
increased Wnt/β-catenin in NF2 was investigated. We show that in-
creased nuclear β-catenin signaling is initiated at the AJs and is regulated
by tyrosine kinase receptors PDGFR/Src and the Rac1/PAK/JNK
pathway in human schwannoma cells.

Materials and Methods

Cell Culture

Human schwannoma cells were kindly provided by NF2 patients
after informed consent. Diagnosis of NF2 was based on clinical cri-
teria defined by the National Institutes of Health consensus conference
on neurofibromatosis. Normal human Schwann cells from healthy

nerve donors were used in this research. Isolation and culturing were
carried out as previously described [22]. Briefly, cells were cultured in
proliferation medium and grown on poly-L-lysine/laminin–coated six-
well plates (Greiner, Bio One, Stonehouse, United Kingdom) or eight-
well permanox chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany).
HEK293T cells were cultured in standard conditions. All experiments
were performed on starved confluent cells unless otherwise stated, and all
experiments were repeated with cells from at least three different patients.

Expression Vectors and Transfection

We used expression vectors pcDNA3.2/V5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) encoding merlin I mutants S518D and S518A (a gift from David
H Gutmann, Washington University, St. Louis). β-Catenin wild-type
(WT) full-length complementary DNA was purchased from Open
Biosystems Abgene (Surrey, United Kingdom) and then cloned into
pENTR11 vector (Invitrogen). β-Catenin mutants Y654F was generated
by the GeneTailor site–directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were designed as previously

described [23]. The WT and mutation were then subcloned into a GFP-
tagged gateway cloning vector pDEST53 (Invitrogen). All transfections
were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Fugene 6
(Roche, Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN).

Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were performed
using standard protocols with NP40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 137 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% NP40). Proteins were detected using ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences, Buck-
inghamshire, United Kingdom). RhoGDI, which has been shown
not to be regulated in our system [24], was used as loading control.
Densities of bands were quantified using FluorS-Multi-Imager and
Quantity One software (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The
following antibodies were used: β-catenin 1:1000, N-cadherin mouse
1:500 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA); active β-catenin (ABC) 1:250
(Millipore, Billerica, MA); β-catenin Y654 1:500 (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA); anti–cyclin D1 1:2000, p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) 1:1000 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); and c-myc 1:250, merlin (C-18)
1:500, RhoGDI 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Immunofluorescence

In brief, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized
with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum.
Cells were incubated overnight with primary antibodies: β-catenin
1:500, N-cadherin mouse 1:500, ABC 1:250, N-cadherin rabbit
1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PAK2 1:250, and anti-GFP 1:500
(Invitrogen). Appropriate Alexa Fluor 488– or Alexa Fluor 594–

(Invitrogen) labeled secondary antibodies were used. Alexa Fluor
488–labeled phalloidin (1:100; Invitrogen) was used to visualize
filamentous actin. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich)
was used for nuclear staining. Cells were mounted with VectaShield
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). As a control, the primary anti-
body was omitted once in every experiment. Cells were examined with
a Zeiss Meta510 confocal microscope using a 403 or 633 oil objectives
and the Zeiss LSM software package (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Proliferation Assay

Schwannoma cells were seeded into Lab-Tek at 80% to 90%
confluency, then transfected with empty vector pDEST53-GFP and
β-catenin–Y654F, respectively. Cells were then starved for 24 hours
and stimulated with GFM for another 24 hours before immunostaining
as described previously. The DAPI- and Ki67- (Dako UK Ltd., Ely,
United Kingdom) stained cells were counted manually. The percentage
of Ki67-positive cells was calculated. Experiments were repeated three
times and with different tumors.

Pervanadate and Inhibitors Treatment

To detect specific tyrosine phosphorylation signal of β-catenin,
starved cells were treated with freshly prepared pervanadate (40 mM
sodium orthovandate, 0.3% [wt/wt] H2O2, and 200 μg/ml catalase) for
30 minutes. Small molecule inhibitors imatinib (10 μM; Novartis, Surrey,
United Kingdom) and SU6656 (4 μM, a gift from Jyrki Kukkonen, Uni-
versity of Helsinki) were added into the growth medium for 30 minutes
of treatment at the same time as pervanadate. For immunostaining, cells
were treated with imatinib (10 μM) and SU6656 (4 μM) for 24 hours

Aldrich) was added into growth medium for 24 hours of treatment.

Lentiviral Short Hairpin RNA Knockdown

A set of pLKO.1-shRNA plasmid encoding a short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) with scrambled sequence or sequences targeting human PAK2
(NM_002577), was purchased from Open Biosystems. After first-round

selection in 293T cells, shRNA clones sh-PAK2a TRCN0000002118
(5′-TGGGAATGGAAGGATCTGTTA-3′) and sh-PAK2b
TRCN0000002115 (5′-CTCTAGGAACCAAAGTGATTT-3′) were
chosen for lentivirus production based on knockdown efficiency fol-
lowing the protocol described in the RNAi Consortium Protocols
Section II (The RNA: Consortium). To infect schwannoma cells, on
day 1, the appropriate amount of cells was seeded in a six-well plate

or Lab-Tek to reach 70% confluency; on day 2, cells were infected with
50% virus (vol/vol) in the full growth medium containing 8 μg/ml
protamine sulfate; and on day 3, growth media were replaced, 4 μg/ml
puromycin was added into medium for selection for 48 hours. The
knockdown efficiency of each individual clone against the scramble
control was verified by Western blot analysis.

Results

Wnt Signaling Is Increased in Primary Human Schwannoma
Cells in a PAK2-Dependent Manner

To confirm whether Wnt signaling is involved in merlin-deficient
tumors and to analyze primary human tumor cells, we used normal

Schwann cells (NF2+/+) and schwannoma cells (NF2−/−). Merlin ac-
cumulates under serum-deprived or -confluent conditions in normal
Schwann cells [25], and therefore, to address how the loss of merlin
leads to loss of contact inhibition of proliferation, all our experiments
were performed with serum starved and confluent cells. Our investi-
gation initiated from comparing the expression of β-catenin between
Schwann and schwannoma cells; however, no significant difference was
observed (Figure 1A), which supports previous findings [13,15,19]. We
next investigated the localization of β-catenin by immunostaining. As
expected, the localization of β-catenin at AJ was disrupted. β-Catenin
was, instead, ubiquitously distributed in the cytoplasm and in the
nucleus in schwannoma cells but not in Schwann cells (Figure 1B).
To confirm the increase of Wnt signaling in schwannoma cells, we

Endogenous β-catenin complex was immunoprecipitated (IP) after treatment with pervanadate to reserve the phosphorylation status of
β-catenin. IgG mouse without anti–β-catenin antibody served as a control. Immunoprecipitates were blotted for β-catenin. Merlin, N-cadherin,
and RhoGDI served as controls. Densities of bands were quantified and compared. The protein level of merlin in the β-catenin complex was
compared between Merlin S518 mutants and empty vector after being corrected with their count parts in total lysates. Error bars represent

compared the expression levels of the components of the Wnt signaling
pathway including ABC (dephosphorylated on Ser37 and Thr41), c-myc,
and cyclin D1. In comparison to Schwann cells, a strong elevation of all
Wnt signaling markers was detected in schwannoma cells (Figure 1C)
that agrees with previous findings in NF2 knockout mouse embryonic
fibroblast. In addition, the fact that ABC is shuttled into the nucleus
was proven by immunostaining using anti-ABC antibodies detecting
nuclear localization of ABC in schwannoma cells (Figure 1D). Taken
together, our data show that canonical Wnt signaling is indeed elevated

in primary human schwannoma cells and not in normal human
Schwann cells.

A recent study confirmed that Wnt signaling promotes the loss of
contact inhibition of proliferation in a Rac-dependent manner [19]. In
primary human endothelial cells, a loop connecting merlin, Rac, and
PAK has been proposed to be responsible to the loss of contact inhibi-
tion [8]. Therefore, we suppressed Rac/PAK with a shRNA construct to
determine whether the Wnt pathway is dependent on the Rac/PAK
pathway in schwannoma cells. Our data suggested that PAK2 is

1108

dominant in human schwannoma cells (Figure W1A) and PAK2 is
activated as phosphorylation at Ser192/197, which could be detected
in schwannoma cells, because of a negative feedback loop with merlin
[26]. Thus, PAK2 was selected as a target of Rac/PAK/JNK pathway
here. The knockdown of PAK2 was confirmed by Western blot
(Figure 2, top panel ). As expected, the pJNK was decreased after knock-
ing down PAK2. More importantly, significant reductions were
observed in Wnt signaling markers (ABC, c-myc, and cyclin D1) in
sh-PAK2a cells compared with the scrambled control. These results
were further supported by the second shRNA construct in both West-
ern blot (Figure W1B, upper panel ) and immunostaining (Figure W1B,
lower panel) because ABC in the nucleus was largely reduced after
PAK2 knock down. These data suggest that PAK2, as a part of the
Rac/JNK pathway, indeed play a critical role in the enhanced Wnt/
β-catenin signaling in human schwannoma cells.

N-cadherin Is Degraded in Schwannoma Cells

To further understand how Wnt/β-catenin is regulated by merlin in
confluent cells, we investigated the AJ complex including β-catenin and
N-cadherin in schwannoma cells by immunoprecipitation (E-cadherin
not being expressed in our human schwannoma model [15]). The AJ
complex was precipitated using an anti–β-catenin antibody (Figure 3A).
We observed that N-cadherin is dramatically reduced in the β-catenin
complex of schwannoma cells. Interestingly, we observed N-cadherin to
be decreased in total lysates of schwannoma cells compared with
Schwann cells.

Because N-cadherin is decreased in human schwannoma cells, we
asked whether down-regulation of N-cadherin is a consequence of
posttranslational modification. We tested whether N-cadherin is de-
graded through a proteasome-dependent pathway. The protein level of
N-cadherin increased significantly after treatment with the proteasome

inhibitor MG132 for 24 hours (Figure 3B). This observation supports
previous studies showing that the ubiquitin proteasome system is
required for degradation of transmembrane receptors, for example,
cadherin proteins [27,28]. As expected, a small portion of cytoplasmic
β-catenin was also degraded through a proteasome-dependent prote-
olysis (Figure 3B), which suggests that the maintenance of β-catenin
stability is an ongoing process.

β-Catenin Y654 Phosphorylation Is Enhanced in
Schwannoma Cells and Mediated by Src and
PDGFR at the Plasma Membrane

Despite β-catenin being turned over to some extent, we found
evidence of increased nuclear localization of β-catenin in human
schwannoma cells (Figure 1B). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 654 on
β-catenin by the epidermal growth factor receptor or Src decreases its
affinity to E-cadherin, therefore weakening the stability of AJs [29].
Because growth factor receptors (PDGFR and the EGF family) are
activated in schwannoma [4] and activation of β-catenin by Rac/PAK
requires phosphorylation at Y654, we wondered if β-catenin is phos-
phorylated at Y654 and if activation of growth factor receptors is
linked to the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in schwannoma
cells. As assessed by immunoblot analysis, Tyr654 phosphorylation
was indeed elevated in human schwannoma compared with Schwann
cells (Figure 4A). To confirm that Tyr654 phosphorylation is linked
to N-cadherin localization, we constructed GFP–β-catenin chimeras
containing either WT or a point mutation Y654F, which cannot be
phosphorylated. To prove the specificity of the antibody used in im-
munostaining, we first transfected GFP–β-catenin–WT and Y654F
constructs into HEK293T cells. As expected, β-catenin colocalized
with N-cadherin at the AJ in those cells (Figure W2). Moreover,
we transfected confluent human primary schwannoma cells with
GFP–β-catenin–WT and GFP–β-catenin–Y654F (Figure 4B). After
selection with antibiotic G418, cell’s confluency was reduced, but
the subcellular localization of proteins at the nucleus, and the plasma
membrane, in cells having cell-cell contact were investigated. The
staining shows that the WT and mutant forms of β-catenin localized
to the nucleus in schwannoma cells, thus confirming the elevated

Wnt signaling observed in Figure 1B. In addition, only overexpressed
Y654F, but not WT, relocalizes endogenous N-cadherin back to the
plasma membrane at least to some extent (Figure 4B). More than
80% of cells showed similar localization. Furthermore, using small
molecule inhibitors, we tested whether Src and PDGFR, which are
both overexpressed and activated in our primary human schwannoma
cells [4], are upstream kinases of β-catenin. The Src inhibitor SU6656
reduced the Tyr654 phosphorylation by 40%, whereas the PDGFR
inhibitor imatinib reduced Tyr654 signals by 55% (Figure 4C ).
Importantly, both imatinib and SU6626 restored the colocalization
of β-catenin and N-cadherin back to the plasma membrane, especially
at AJ sites (Figure 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that Src/
PDGFR–mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin at Y654
is involved in the disruption of AJs complex in human primary
schwannoma cells.

Active Merlin Maintains Y654 Dephosphorylated
β-Catenin and N-cadherin Complex at the
Cell Surface to Inhibit Proliferation

It is known that only Ser518 hypophosphorylated (active) merlin
functions as tumor suppressor. If nuclear β-catenin is a main stimulator
of transcriptional activity and proliferation in merlin-deficient tumors,
one could hypothesize that Ser518 hypophosphorylated merlin would
inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling through physical interaction and stabi-
lization of β-catenin/N-cadherin complex at the AJs. We have therefore
examined this hypothesis using traditional merlin mutants S518D
(phosphomimic) and S518A (dephosphomimic). In coimmunoprecipi-
tation (co-IP) experiments using HEK293T cells, we found that only
merlin mutant S518A forms a complex with endogenous β-catenin,
which constitutively binds to N-cadherin (Figure 5A). This interaction
between S518A and β-catenin was confirmed by a co-IP with an anti-
merlin antibody in a cell line stably expressing Merlin-S518A stable line
(Figure 5B). In addition, we observed that the S518A mutant of merlin
preferentially binds to β-catenin–Y654F as shown in the immuno-
precipitation assay (Figure 5B). In addition, the S518A mutant of
merlin relocates β-catenin and N-cadherin back to the plasma mem-
brane in human schwannoma cells (Figure 5, C and D). Finally and

importantly, we tested whether Y654 β-catenin is important for the
hyperproliferation of schwannoma cells. Because the PDGFR and Src
are also upstream of other important mitogenic pathways, for example,
the MEK/ERK pathway [4], their inhibitors are not suitable to address
this question. Thus, we decided to overexpress β-catenin–Y654F in hu-
man primary schwannoma cells. Overexpression of β-catenin–Y654F
significantly reduced proliferation, in contrast to the control overexpres-
sion of empty vector pDEST53-GFP (Figure 6) in schwannoma cells.

Discussion
In this contribution, we show that, on confluency, canonical Wnt/
β-catenin signaling is activated in primary human schwannoma cells,
ABC localizes in the nucleus and Wnt target genes c-myc and cyclin
D1 are overexpressed as a consequence of enhanced transcriptional
activities (Figure 1). We also demonstrate that the elevated Wnt sig-
naling is dependent on the Rac/PAK/JNK pathway (Figure 2). These
observations agree well with previously published data in different
cell types [19,20,30]. We then showed that hyperactivated Wnt sig-

naling is initiated from tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin at the
AJ sites (Figure 4, A and B) and associated with the degradation of
N-cadherin (Figure 3). Furthermore, by using PDGFR inhibitor
imatinib and Src inhibitor SU6656, we demonstrate the importance
of Src/PDGFR kinases in activation of Wnt signaling in merlin-
deficient schwannoma (Figure 4, C and D). Importantly, overexpres-
sion of β-catenin that cannot be phosphorylated at tyrosine 654 reduces
proliferation of primary human schwannoma cells (Figure 6). Finally,
we demonstrate that only merlin cannot be phosphorylated regulates
AJ complex by maintaining the non–tyrosine phosphorylated β-catenin
together with N-cadherin in the site of AJs (Figure 5). Taken together,
our data suggest that Ser518 hypophosphorylated merlin inhibits Wnt/
β-catenin signaling through regulation of Rac/PAK/JNK pathway
and additionally Src/PDGFR kinases. Therefore, merlin loss leads to
a coordinated activation of these pathways (Figure 7).

Up-regulation/activation of β-catenin and down-regulation of E/N-
cadherin have been reported in many tumors including meningiomas
[31,32]. However, in a study of osteoblast and bone formation, it has

Figure 7. Hypothetical model of merlin’s role on inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In normal cells, merlin inhibits Src/PDGFR, Rac/
PAK/JNK, and maybe N-cadherin ubiquitination as well to keep Y654 unphosphorylated β-catenin staying at AJ together with N-cadherin.
In addition, excess cytoplasmic β-catenin can be regulated by proteasome degradation. In merlin-deficient tumor cells, loss of merlin
leads to activation of PDGFR and Src (red). β-Catenin is then phosphorylated by Src/PDGFR at Y654 and disassociated with N-cadherin.
In further regulation by activated Rac/PAK/JNK (red), β-catenin shuttles into the nucleus to activate transcriptional factors LEF/TCF and
then drive the expression of downstream targets, namely, cyclin D1, c-myc, and eventually, proliferation is increased in tumor cells.

Dissecting Wnt/β-catenin Signaling in Human Schwannoma

been found that N-cadherin negatively regulates proliferation by de-
creasing Wnt/β-catenin signaling [33]. In mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts, Nf2 inactivation did not alter the expression of β-catenin
and N-cadherin [13]. However, an increase of N-cadherin expression
at the mRNA level and protein level was observed in primary Schwann
cells derived from the Nf2 flox/flox mouse model and human schwannoma
tissue [34]. In our human primary schwannoma model, no change in
N-cadherin expression was observed at the protein level in subconfluent
schwannoma cells [15]. However, in accordance with data in different
tumors including meningioma, a decrease in N-cadherin combined
with strongly increased phosphorylation of β-catenin at Y654 was de-
tected in confluent schwannoma cells, compared with Schwann cells
(Figures 3A and 4A). It has been shown that after β-catenin phosphor-
ylation at Y654, E-cadherin uncouples from β-catenin at the AJ and
becomes a subject for endocytosis and E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination
and proteolysis [27]. In neurons, overexpression of the inactive β-catenin
mutant Y654F prevents N-cadherin internalization, resulting in stabi-
lization of surface N-cadherin molecules [35]. Therefore, we hypothe-
sized that the down-regulation of N-cadherin in our schwannoma cells
occurs by posttranslational degradation on confluency. This hypothesis
was confirmed by the increased levels of N-cadherin on treatment with
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 3B). In accordance with a previ-
ous study in human epidermoid carcinoma cells [36], our data suggest
that β-catenin might dissociate from N-cadherin at the plasma mem-
brane during N-cadherin internalization (Figures 3A and 4B, upper
panel ). Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin at Y654, which
is an Src phosphorylation site [37], plays a important role in AJ dis-
assembly as overexpression of a mutant form of β-catenin (Y654F) re-
stored the colocalization of N-cadherin and β-catenin (Figure 4B, lower
panel ). Importantly, overexpression of the mutant form of β-catenin
reduced the hyperproliferation in human primary schwannoma cells
(Figure 6). The importance of β-catenin Y654 phosphorylation in en-
hancing Wnt signaling supports previous in vivo findings in intestinal
tumorigenesis, where overexpression of a phospho-mimicking β-catenin
Y654E in a conditional knock-in mouse strongly potentiated Wnt
signaling–dependent intestinal tumor initiation [38]. In addition, over-
expression of the merlin mutant S518A in schwannoma cells also restored
the localization of β-catenin and N-cadherin to the plasma membrane
(Figure 5, C and D).

We have previously demonstrated that the Rac/PAK/JNK and Src/
PDGFR pathways are activated [4,7] and linked Rac activity to the
immature AJs in human schwannoma cells [15]. Our present data
suggest that PAK2 is indeed a part of Rac/JNK signaling for the reg-
ulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Figures 2 and W1B). This result
supports previously report that elevation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
in NF2−/− mouse fibroblast is Rac dependent [19]. Importantly, for
the first time, we demonstrate a link between Src/PDGFR and the loss
of contact inhibition in human schwannoma cells (Figure 4, C and D).
However, it is still unclear exactly how merlin inhibits phosphorylation
of β-catenin through upstream kinases, for example, PDGFR and Src.
One possible explanation could be the competition between merlin and
Src for ErbB2 binding [39]. Immunoprecipitation experiments using
traditional merlin mutants (S518A/D) suggest that only merlin mutant
that cannot be phosphorylated forms a complex with β-catenin
(Figure 5A). Merlin could compete with Src for binding to β-catenin
as well as ErbB2. However, currently available data support a second
possibility that merlin inhibits growth factor receptors or other RTK
signaling pathways such as PDGFR by regulating their abundance on
the cell surface [2]. Merlin forms a complex with AJ components

through its binding partner, the Na+-H+ exchanger regulatory factor
1/ERM binding protein of 50 kDa (NHERF1/EBP50) rather than
through direct interaction in Schwann cells [40]. It has been shown
that NHERF1 connects components of the AJ complex to PDGFR
to modulate the actin cytoskeleton [41]. More importantly, depletion
of merlin causes a retarded degradation of PDGFR in schwannoma cells
[4,42] and NHERF is thought to be involved in the regulation of
PDGFR internalization in NF2−/− cells [42]. Therefore, it is likely
that merlin inhibits the PDGFR abundance and disassembly of AJ
through NHERF.

In summary, in primary human tumor cells from NF2 patients,
merlin loss seems to lead to a coordinated increase of Rac/PAK/
JNK and PDGFR/Src signaling, loss of contact inhibition including
β-catenin Y654 phosphorylation, and N-cadherin degradation, re-
sulting in increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling as shown in our model
(Figure 7). This coordinated activation is relevant for proliferation of
NF2 tumor cells.
