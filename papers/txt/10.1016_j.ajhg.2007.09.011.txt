Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of complex etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. We have implicated the neu-
rexin 1 (NRXN1) gene in two independent subjects who display an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in association with a balanced chro-
mosomal abnormality involving 2p16.3. In the ﬁrst, with karyotype 46,XX,ins(16;2)(q22.1;p16.1p16.3)pat, NRXN1 is directly disrupted
within intron 5. Importantly, the father possesses the same chromosomal abnormality in the absence of ASD, indicating that the inter-
ruption of a-NRXN1 is not fully penetrant and must interact with other factors to produce ASD. The breakpoint in the second subject,
with 46,XY,t(1;2)(q31.3;p16.3)dn, occurs ~750 kb 50 to NRXN1 within a 2.6 Mb genomic segment that harbors no currently annotated
genes. A scan of the NRXN1 coding sequence in a cohort of ASD subjects, relative to non-ASD controls, revealed that amino acid alter-
ations in neurexin 1 are not present at high frequency in ASD. However, a number of rare sequence variants in the coding region, in-
cluding two missense changes in conserved residues of the a-neurexin 1 leader sequence and of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domain, respectively, suggest that even subtle changes in NRXN1 might contribute to susceptibility to ASD.

Autism and related developmental disabilities, clinically
referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs; MIM
209850), affect up to ~1 in 150 children1 and include lan-
guage impairment, difﬁculties in social interaction and
communication, a restricted pattern of interests, unusual
behaviors, and/or stereotyped and repetitive motor man-
nerisms. ASDs are likely to result from a complex interac-
tion of genetic factors, environment, experience, and, pos-
sibly, chance. Most readily analyzed are the genes because
the fully sequenced human genome presents a ﬁnite uni-
verse to explore for contributing factors. ASDs are among
the most heritable behavioral disorders, on the basis of
familial relative risk and twin studies.2 Although several
monogenic disorders might involve autism-like symp-
toms, their relevance to most cases of ASD is not clear.
Genetic-linkage studies have suggested a few novel chro-
mosomal locations for ASD genes, but the richest source
of candidates might lie in chromosomal abnormalities
that target particular genomic segments.3–8 Cytogenetic
abnormalities occur in >5% of ASD cases and, although
some regions, such as 2q37, 15q11–q13, and 22q13.3, are
seen recurrently, the Autism Chromosome Rearrangement

Database4 currently reports 391 visible chromosomal
breakpoints spread throughout the genome. Recent appli-
cation of higher-resolution techniques has revealed fre-
quent submicroscopic genomic abnormalities and docu-
mented a signiﬁcant increase in de novo copy-number
changes, suggesting that many different genomic disrup-
tions might predispose to ASD.6–8 These genetic analyses
are consistent with the view that many different genes
contribute, possibly leading by different means to a ﬁnal
common neurodevelopmental pathway that produces
the autism phenotype. ASD genes are likely to involve
both common variants that contribute broadly to suscepti-
bility and rare variants that contribute in fewer individuals
but might have stronger effect. Either could provide
fundamental insights into the mechanism(s) leading to
ASD.

In the Developmental Genome Anatomy Project
(DGAP), we have sought genes of developmental impor-
tance disrupted by apparently balanced chromosomal
aberrations.9–12 We have focused where possible on ‘‘dou-
ble-hit’’ cases, in which independent breakpoints in two
individuals with related phenotypes occur in the same

Identiﬁcation of BAC Clone Crossing the DGAP123

Figure 2.
2p16.3 Breakpoint
FISH analysis of DGAP123 with 2p16.3 BAC clone RP11-391D19
(green) shows hybridization to both the der(2) and der(16) chro-
mosomes, indicating that the breakpoint of the insertion is located
within the sequence of this genomic clone.

The detailed phenotypes of DGAP123, her mother
(DGAP123-2), and her father (DGAP124) were determined
by diagnostic instruments, behavioral questionnaires, and
neuropsychological assessment in the Psychiatric and Neu-
rodevelopmental Genetics Unit (PNGU) of the Center for
Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital.
This was not possible for DGAP200, whose phenotypic in-
formation and diagnoses were provided by communica-
tion with the clinician. DGAP123 meets criteria for autism
on both the ADOS and ADI-R, with manifestations that in-
clude ritualized behaviors, vocal and motor mannerisms,
limited eye contact, minimal verbal output, little change
in affect or facial expression, and minimal seeking of inter-
action.15,16 Her overall level of functioning falls within the
range of mental retardation. Neither parent meets formal
criteria for autism, although each has minor functional ab-
normalities. The parents’ overall intellectual abilities are in
the normal range, although the mother exhibits a relative
deﬁcit in working memory. The father, who shares the
chromosome rearrangement with his daughter, displayed
stuttering as a child, has received speech services in the
past, and has some persistent difﬁculty in articulation.
He also exhibits some features of obsessive compulsive dis-
order (OCD; MIM 143465) and attention deﬁcit disorder
(ADHD; MIM 143465), although he has never received
a formal diagnosis of either. DGAP200 has diagnoses
of PDD-NOS (MIM 209850), along with ADHD, conduct
disorder with early onset, and intermittent explosive
disorder.

The chromosomal abnormality in DGAP123 involves
the excision of ~8.9 Mb of DNA between 2p16.1 and
2p16.3 and its insertion into 16q22.1 (Figure 1). By array

chromosomal region, maximizing the likelihood that the
chromosomal disruption is causative. The independent oc-
currence among our ﬁrst 200 DGAP cases, encompassing
a wide variety of clinical phenotypes, of two subjects dis-
playing ASD in association with a chromosomal break-
point in 2p16.3 has revealed NRXN1 (MIM 600565) as an
autism-associated gene, consistent with recent reports of
both de novo heterozygous deletion of NRXN1 and rare
sequence variants in the b-NRXN1 leader sequence in
ASD.8,13

Two DGAP subjects with an ASD phenotype, DGAP123
and DGAP200, display chromosomal breakpoints
in
2p16.3: DGAP123 is a female subject with a familial rear-
rangement, 46,XX,ins(16;2)(q22.1;p16.1p16.3)pat,
and
DGAP200 is a male with a de novo apparently balanced
translocation, 46,XY,t(1;2)(q31.3;p16.3)dn (Figure 1). Blood
samples were obtained from both and from the parents of
DGAP123 for preparation of DNA and EBV-transformed
lymphoblastoid cell lines.14 All human studies were per-
formed under informed consent protocols approved by the
Partners HealthCare System Human Research Committee
(Boston, MA) or the Yale University School of Medicine
(New Haven, CT).

this anomaly is balanced, showing no signiﬁcant loss or
gain of copy number at either site or elsewhere in the ge-
nome. FISH with whole BAC clones, chosen from NCBI
and UCSC websites and obtained from CITB-D and RP11
libraries (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, and the Children’s
Hospital of Oakland Research Institute, CA), mapped the
2p16 breakpoints within BAC clones RP11-391D19 (Fig-
ure 2) and RP11-579K4. Southern-blot analysis in DGAP123
narrowed the breakpoint to a 1368 bp region (Figure 3) in
intron 5 of the large NRXN1 gene, which spans 1.1 Mb and
encodes a-neurexin 1 from 24 exons and b-neurexin 1
from seven exons (Figure 4). Because each isoform is pro-
duced from a different promotor and has a different ﬁrst
exon,17,18 the DGAP123 breakpoint directly disrupts the
a-NRXN1 sequence but leaves b-NRXN1 coding sequences
intact.

The 2p16.1 breakpoint in DGAP123 was mapped to a
584 bp segment within BAC clones RP11-303F17, RP11-
66A9, and CTD-3245F16 (Figure 3), in a gene desert ﬂanked
by BCL11A (MIM 606557) and FANCL (MIM 608111),

located 589 kb proximal and 1.6 Mb distal, respectively.
The chromosome 16 breakpoint was ﬂanked, by RP11-
52E21 and RP11-311C24, but not further delineated in
a 325 kb segment of 16q22.1 that contains the genes
SNTB2 (basic beta 2 syntrophin; MIM 600027), VPS4A (vac-
uolar-protein-sorting factor 4A; MIM 609982), PDF (peptide
deformylase, mitochondrial precursor), COG8 (oligomeric
golgi complex component 8; MIM 606979), NIP7 (60S ribo-
some subunit biogenesis protein NIP7 homolog), TMED6
(transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 6 pre-
cursor), TERF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2; MIM
602027), CYB5B (cytochrome b5 outer mitochondrial
membrane isoform; MIM 602027), and NFAT5 (nuclear
factor of activated T cells 5 isoform a; MIM 604708).

For DGAP200, FISH mapping placed the 2p16.3 break-
point between BAC clones RP11-1141D22 and RP11-
18O19, ~750 kb from exon 1 of a-NRXN1, within a 2.6 Mb
upstream segment that is devoid of annotated genes (Fig-
ure 4). FISH studies localized the chromosome 1 breakpoint
between RP11-25C18 and RP11-173E24 in a gene desert
with no genes within 1 Mb on either side. Array CGH

Figure 4. NRXN1 Region of 2p16.3 and DGAP Subject Breakpoints
This schematic diagram, reworked from tracks provided by the UCSC Genome Browser, shows exon locations and transcript orientation for
a-NRXN1 and the overlapping b-NRXN1, along with the upstream region devoid of known genes, below a black bar indicating 2p16.3 and
base-pair locations from the telomeric side (left) toward the centromere (right). The blue graph between these shows the estimated reg-
ulatory potential (0–0.4) calculated by comparing frequencies of short alignment patterns between known regulatory elements and neu-
tral DNA across seven species (human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow).19 Regulatory potential is highest at the recog-
nized a-NRXN1 and b-NRXN1 promotors and especially at an anonymous site more than 1 Mb upstream of NRXN1. Red lines indicate the
position in a-NRXN1 intron 5 and approximate position upstream of NRXN1 for the DGAP123 and DGAP200 breakpoints, respectively. FISH-
mapped BAC clones crossing the former are shown in red, with selected clones mapping to der(2) and der(16) shown in dark blue and teal,
respectively. For the latter, FISH-mapped BAC clones mapping to der(1) and der(2) are shown in dark brown and light brown, respectively.

analysis of DGAP200 genomic DNA revealed a cryptic dele-
tion of ~534 kb within 2p16.2, 3 Mb proximal to NRXN1,
removing the genes ACYP2 (muscle-type acylphosphatase
2; MIM 102595) and TSPYL6 (Testis-speciﬁc protein
Y-linked-like 6), FLJ40298 (a hypothetical protein), and
SPTBN1 (spectrin, beta, nonerythrocytic 1 isoform 1; MIM
182790). It is conceivable that the deletion of one or
more of these loci could contribute to the severe behavioral
phenotype of DGAP200.

The gene desert upstream of NRXN1 contains sites pre-
dicted by ESPERR to have strong regulatory potential on
the basis of comparative genomics, in seven species, that
used a combination of conservation, composition and
short-pattern structure information (Figure 4).19 This sug-
gested that the DGAP200 translocation, although not di-
rectly truncating NRXN1, might still disrupt its expression,
perhaps by separating a long-range regulatory element
from the coding portions of the gene. Because NRXN1 ex-
pression has been studied previously mainly in neuronal
tissue, we ﬁrst determined whether the gene is expressed
in lymphoblastoid cells, the only tissue readily available
from DGAP subjects. We used RT-PCR of RNA from control
lymphoblasts to amplify portions of the a-NRXN1 mRNA,
as follows: exons 1–2, exons 2–7, exons 7–9, exons 12–14,

exons 20–22 (exons 3–5 of b-NRXN1) and exons 22–24
(exons 5–7 of b-NRXN1), as well as exons 1–5 of b-NRXN1.
A typical result is shown in Figure 5. All primer pairs pro-
duced an appropriately spliced product (albeit at much
lower abundance) of expected size and correct DNA se-
quence compared to brain mRNA, except a-NRXN1 exons
1–2, exons 2–7 and b-NRXN1 exons 1–5, suggesting that
while neurexin 1 is expressed, the precise equivalent of
neither neuronal a- nor b-neurexin 1 is present. Rather,
any neurexin 1 isoform expressed in lymphoblasts is
apparently produced from an mRNA that remains to be
fully delineated but that does not share a 50 end with
either the brain a or b isoforms.

NRXN1 mRNA was detected in all control lymphoblasts
tested, as well as in cell lines from DGAP123 and family
members and from DGAP200, but variation in the levels
of individual RT-PCR products from different exons and
mRNA preparations precluded reproducible quantitation.
To test for an effect of the DGAP200 translocation, we cap-
italized on a polymorphism in the NRXN1 30 untranslated
region in which alleles possess either one or two consecu-
tive copies of a 4 bp TTAC stretch. Control heterozygotes
showed expression of both allelic variants in lymphoblas-
toid cell RNA. By contrast, whereas DGAP200 genomic

exons by direct sequencing to identify variants, initially
in 57 subjects with ASD (autism, Asperger syndrome,
and PDD-NOS; MIM 209850) compared with 57 individ-
uals with OCD (MIM 164230) or Tourette syndrome (TS;
MIM 137580) (27 and 30, respectively). In addition to
common polymorphisms or previously reported SNPs,
we identiﬁed seven novel variants that are within the cod-
ing sequence (Table 1) and that occurred as heterozygous
differences in single individuals, all in the ASD cohort.
None was found on the 114 chromosomes of the TS or
OCD cohorts or on 354 control chromosomes from 177
unrelated members of the CEPH collection. Two were mis-
sense changes, L18Q in the signal peptide of a-neurexin
1 and L748I in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domain, but the other ﬁve variants (three in exons speciﬁc
to a-NRXN1) did not change amino acids. Subsequently,
we sequenced the coding exons of 192 individuals (87
affected) from 53 families of the Autism Genetic Resource
Exchange (AGRE) cohort but did not identify any rare
coding-sequence variants cosegregating with ASD. Of the
seven novel variants reported above, only one, L748I,
was seen, in two independent ASD families in a total of
three of four ASD affected individuals and one of two
unaffected individuals, consistent with the possibility
that it is an ASD susceptibility allele with incomplete
penetrance.

The observation of ASD in independent DGAP subjects
establishes clearly that disruption of NRXN1 can contrib-
ute to autism but further indicates that such disruption,
and by extension the consequences of heterozygous dele-
tion, might show incomplete penetrance. DGAP123 and
DGAP200 reinforce the recent report from the Autism Ge-
nome Project of a family in which two sisters with ASD
share a de novo heterozygous deletion of 2p16.3 that di-
rectly affects the NRXN1 gene.8 However, the lack of ASD
phenotype in DGAP124, the father of DGAP123 who
shares her chromosomal abnormality, demonstrates that
heterozygous inactivation of NRXN1 is not by itself sufﬁ-
cient to cause the symptoms of autism. This is consistent
with the report of a deletion of exons 6–9 of a-NRXN1 in
a Japanese participant in the International HapMap Pro-
ject, an individual expected to be without obvious abnor-
mal phenotype.20 NRXN1 mutation probably contributes
by predisposing or sensitizing the individual, but addi-
tional factors are also required for ASD phenotypes to be
expressed. The phenomenon of incomplete penetrance
might well complicate interpretation of other chromo-
somal abnormalities in ASD. For example, although de
novo copy-number changes reported in several studies
are likely to target important genes, these changes might
be necessary but not sufﬁcient to produce ASD in the
research subjects.4–8 Similarly,
familial rearrangements
inherited from a non-ASD parent or de novo changes
also seen in unaffected individuals cannot be excluded as
contributing to ASD. The same considerations are likely
to apply to the interpretation of chromosomal differences

blastoid Cells
Each panel shows the results of ampliﬁcation of reverse-tran-
scribed mRNA from human brain (B) and control lymphoblastoid
cells (L), with primers designed to amplify products of known
size and sequence (available upon request), based upon the estab-
lished brain mRNA sequences of a- and b-NRXN1. The third lane in
each panel is a standard marker with band sizes in bp from smallest
to largest of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 650, 850, and 1,000, in the
relevant resolving range. Arrows indicate the expected sizes of PCR
products based on known splice variants from brain. Any additional
bands not marked by arrows are PCR artifacts, corroborated by DNA
sequencing. The lymphoblastoid cell mRNA produced matching
NRXN1 products for at least one expected splice product for each
of the primer pairs Ex07-09, Ex12-14, Ex20-22 and Ex22-24 (this
product is equivalent to b-NRXN1 Ex05-07), but no PCR products
for Ex01-02, Ex02-07, or b-NRXN1 Ex01-05. Matching PCR products
from the lymphoblastoid cell mRNA were conﬁrmed as the expected
NRXN1 products by DNA sequencing.

We also performed western-blot analyses of protein ly-
sates from cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines of DGAP123,

(DGAP124),
DGAP200, and normal controls with a neurexin-1-speciﬁc
antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal region
expected to be expressed from our mRNA studies. Figure 7
shows typical results. A speciﬁc neurexin 1 band at ~82 kDa
was detected reproducibly in all samples. This band is not
in which a-NRXN1 and
seen in brain-tissue extracts,
b-NRXN11 products migrate at 160–200 kDa and 90–
100 kDa, respectively, depending on alternative splicing
and glycosylation. The ~82 kDa band was consistently
and signiﬁcantly reduced in intensity in lysates from
DGAP123 and from her father, DGAP124, relative to the
proband’s mother, DGAP123-2, and to normal controls
(Figure 7). Interestingly, DGAP200 also displayed signiﬁ-
cantly reduced expression of this neurexin 1 band, consis-
tent with a position effect of the upstream breakpoint. The
precise structure of this ~82 kDa neurexin 1 isoform rela-
tive to the neuronal isoforms and its extent of glycosyla-
tion remain to be determined by more detailed studies.

Because the ‘‘double-hit’’ nature of the DGAP cases pro-
vided a strong argument for these breakpoints contribut-
ing to the phenotypes in the respective subjects, we sought
to determine whether NRXN1 coding-sequence alterations,
such as nonsense mutations, missense alterations, or
frame shifts, might be a frequent predisposing factor in

rangement is used as a route to the genes underlying the
disease mechanism.

Additional investigation will be required for deﬁnition
of the proportion of autism cases in which NRXN1 is a fac-
tor, the nature of NRXN1 genetic variants that confer sus-
ceptibility, and the potential functional consequences of
these alleles. Our follow-up sequencing analyses revealed
several rare variants in autism subjects, suggesting that
noninactivating genetic variation in NRXN1 might also
predispose to ASD. Consistent with this notion, Feng
et al.13 have reported that rare structural variants of the
b-neurexin 1 signal peptide are present in several individ-
uals with autism but absent from more than 500 controls.
Interestingly, the L18Q missense change in NRXN1 occurs
in the signal-peptide region of the a-neurexin 1 isoform
and alters a residue that is conserved throughout verte-
brate evolution, including zebraﬁsh, chicken, opossum,
mouse, rat, dog, and cow. The L748I change in an EGF-
like domain changes a residue that is similarly conserved
through vertebrate evolution. Still, our ﬁndings indicate
that the majority of subjects with ASD do not possess
dramatic coding-sequence changes in NRXN1 that signiﬁ-
cantly alter the structure of the protein. However, the
notable frequency of rare variants in ASD individuals
suggests that even subtle disruptions might contribute to
susceptibility. In particular, the seemingly innocuous syn-
onymous variants cannot be dismissed out of hand given
evidence that such coding-region changes can affect splic-

ing enhancer or suppressor regulatory sequences, thereby
altering the pattern of splicing, and can also alter protein
folding, presumably because of effects on the rate of trans-
lation.21,22 Additional investigation is clearly required to
determine whether any or all of the single-nucleotide var-
iants identiﬁed here actually have functional conse-
quences associated with autism and whether screening of
larger numbers of individuals will reveal additional alter-
ations. Like the DGAP123/124 alteration, even those rare
variants that have dramatic effects on expression of the al-
tered allele or on function of the protein product might
not show complete penetrance in ASD. It is also conceiv-
able that in addition to rare variants, common polymor-
phic variation at NRXN1 might also be associated with
ASD, a possibility suggested tentatively by some NRXN1
region SNPs from a low-density scan of the genome.8

The case for NRXN1 in autism is made even more compel-
ling by what is known of the neurobiology of its protein
products. Neurexins act as cell-adhesion molecules and re-
ceptors in the brain, with over 2000 isoforms produced by
use of alternative promotors and extensive alternative splic-
ing.23–26 The a-neurexins contain epidermal EGF-like se-
quences and laminin G domains and interact with neur-
exophilins (Ca2þ
independent) and dystroglycan (Ca2þ
dependent).27–29 The functional consequences of these
nteractions remain predominantly to be elucidated.23 The
a-neurexins and the b-neurexins, which lack EGF-like se-
quences and contain one laminin G domain, can both inter-
act variably with a second set of neuronal receptors termed

the neuroligins (Ca2þ
dependent), dependent on alternative
splicing in both the neurexin and neuroligin genes.30 Inter-
estingly, mutations in two of the ﬁve neuroligin (NLGN)
genes are rare causes of ASD, suggesting a potential role for
neurexin-neuroligin interaction in the neurodevelopmen-
tal process disrupted in autism.31–36 Notably, NLGN4X mu-
tations might also produce mental retardation, suggesting
that the mental retardation seen in DGAP123 might also re-
sult from altered neurexin-neuroligin interactions and that
NRXN1 mutations might be involved in a broader spectrum
of cognitive-impairment phenotypes.35

Neurexins and neuroligins bind to each other across the
synaptic cleft, with the neurexin embedded in the presyn-
aptic membrane and the neuroligin embedded in the post-
synaptic membrane. This interaction has a dramatic impact
on both sides of the synapse because presentation of neuro-
ligins on nonneuronal cells can induce clustering of the
neurexins and presynaptic differentiation on glutamater-
gic axons, whereas presentation of neurexins to dendrites
can lead to aggregation of neuroligins and postsynaptic dif-
ferentiation.37,38 Extensive alternative splicing occurs at
conserved sites in both types of genes, controls the selectiv-
ity of binding of their products, and appears to underlie dif-
ferential synaptic function, with differential selectivity, for
example, for glutamatergic versus GABAergic synapses. The
complexity of isoforms that can be produced and their
functional consequences suggest that subtle shifts in the
distribution of different isoforms, including reductions in
individual forms could affect the balance of excitatory
and inhibitory input for any particular neuron.23

a-neurexins also play a role at synapses in normal neuro-
transmitter release and the function of synaptic calcium
channels, deﬁned in part by experiments in knockout
mice.39 The effect on presynaptic calcium channels is inde-
pendent of neuroligin but is required for both glutamate
and GABA release in vivo. Individual knockouts of the
three a-neurexins are viable, in contrast to the lethality
of multiple knockouts, suggesting a degree of functional
redundancy in this gene family. Interestingly, although

(lane 1), DGAP123-2 (lane 2), DGAP124 (lane 3), DGAP200 (lane
4), and DGAP123 (lane 5) were probed on western blots with a C-
terminal neurexin 1 antibody (top panel: P-15, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), preincubated without or with speciﬁc
blocking peptide. These same blots were also probed with a glycer-
aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (bottom
panel: FL-335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) so that the loading
amount in each lane could be monitored. Lanes 1 and 2 represent
individuals (unrelated control and mother of DGAP123, respec-
tively) who have no cytogenetic abnormality of 2p16.3, whereas
lanes 3–5 represent
(DGAP124, DGAP200, and
DGAP123) with a 2p16.3 chromosomal abnormality. The ~82 kDa
neurexin 1 band quantitated by densitometry in (B) is indicated
by an arrow. The smaller bands were not detected reproducibly or
in consistent proportion relative to the largest band and could rep-
resent degradation products, alternative isoforms or cross-reacting
proteins.
(B) The relative band intensity of the ~82 kDa neurexin 1 band
(normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inten-
sity and compared with either one or two different control lympho-
blasts in each case) is shown as the mean band intensity (5SD)
relative to control from three different experiments. The numbers
correspond to the following subjects: 1, Control; 2, DGAP123-2;
3, DGAP124; 4, DGAP200; and 5, DGAP123. Signiﬁcant reduction

female mutant mice that lack only the a form of neurexin 1
are viable, fertile, and indistinguishable in appearance
from wild-type mice, they display maternal indifference
that leads to increased death of their pups independent
of pup genotype.40 This behavioral abnormality suggests
the existence of at least one critical function for Nrxn1
that cannot be compensated by the presence of intact
Nrxn2 and Nrxn3.

Overall, the involvement of neurexin 1 in development
and function of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, its
interactions with the neuroligins, and its generation of a be-
havioral abnormality in knockout mice all make it an attrac-
tive candidate for involvement in autism. The complexity of
neurexin expression and of its interactions suggests that
a shift of the balance in the distribution of neurexin isoforms
could have profound consequences, including perhaps al-
tering the relative strengths of excitatory and inhibitory syn-
apses because an increase in the ratio of excitation/inhibi-
tion in key neural systems is postulated to be a common
pathway for causing autism.41 However, the fact that inacti-
vation of one a-NRXN1 allele by the chromosomal excision
is not fully penetrant indicates that other factors must coop-
erate to produce the ASD phenotype. Delineation of such
factors might be essential for full understanding of both
the role of NRXN1 and the mechanisms underlying ASD
and can be expected to result in part from the discovery of
new autism genes with the power of human genetics.
