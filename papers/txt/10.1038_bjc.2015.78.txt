Background: Young women with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are reported to have a higher risk of breast cancer than others,
and this might have implications for screening programmes. Our aim was to calculate this risk.

Methods: An all-England linked data set of hospital admissions and deaths was analysed to determine age-specific rates of breast
cancer in women with NF1 and controls.

Results: The age-specific excess risk of breast cancer, comparing the NF1 cohort with the control cohort, was elevated 6.5-fold
(95% confidence interval 2.6–13.5) in women aged 30–39 years. There was a 4.4 (2.5–7.0) times higher risk among women aged
40–49.

Conclusions: Women with NF1 develop breast cancer at younger ages than the general population.

We have previously reported on the risk of a wide range of cancer
types in individuals with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) in
England (Seminog and Goldacre, 2013). Among other findings of
elevated risks of site-specific cancers, the study demonstrated high
risk of breast cancer among women with NF1. We sought to
provide a more detailed breakdown of the results by age at which
women with NF1 were diagnosed with breast cancer. This
information could be used to guide the development of clinical
recommendations about an appropriate age at which to start
inviting women with NF1 for breast cancer screening.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We analysed an all-England data set of linked Hospital Episode
Statistics, which includes all hospital day cases and inpatient
admissions in NHS hospitals in England, and mortality statistics,
for 1999–2011. The risk of breast cancer in the cohort of women
admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of NF1, ICD 10 code Q85.0,
was compared with the risk in a control cohort. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria for defining NF1, and the methods used in
analysing the data set, are described in detail in our previous paper
on NF1 and cancers (Seminog and Goldacre, 2013). We excluded
women from the NF1 and the control cohort if they had a prior

record of breast cancer. We followed individuals in the NF1 cohort
and the control cohort, through record linkage, for the develop-
ment of subsequent breast cancer. The rate ratio (RR) of the risk of
breast cancer was calculated on the basis of person-days at risk. We
calculated the rate ratio using the formula RR¼ (ONF/ENF)/(Ocont/
Econt), where the O’s and E’s are the observed and expected
numbers of cases of breast cancer in the NF and control cohorts.
The details of statistical analysis used here are described elsewhere
(Seminog and Goldacre, 2013, Gold et al, 2015). In the original
study by Seminog and Goldacre (2013), the data were analysed by
age at first recorded hospitalisation for NF1 or control condition.
However, when considering screening programmes, age at cancer
occurrence is the relevant age. Accordingly, here we calculated age-
specific risks of breast cancer in women with NF1, and controls, on
the basis of the women’s age at first hospitalisation for breast
cancer. The start date for follow-up of each individual in each age-
specific analysis was the date of first hospital record for NF1, or
first hospital record for the conditions in the control cohort, and
the end date was the date of first hospital record for breast cancer,
or death (regardless of cause of death), reaching the upper limit of
the age range (for example, reaching 40 in the analysis of breast
cancer in women aged 30–39), or the end of data collection (31
December 2011), whichever came first. The comparison between
the NF1 cohort and the control cohort was standardised for age at

entry into the cohort in 5-year age groups, year of entry in single
calendar years, region of residence and quintile of socioeconomic
status according to the English Index of Multiple Deprivation. The
age-specific rate ratios are summarised in 10-year age bands.

We do not have data about migration of the study population;
accordingly, any estimate of absolute risk, undertaken wholly
within our data set, would be imprecise. However, in addition to
the estimates of relative risk within the data set, given as the rate
ratios, we approximated the age-specific annual absolute risks in
women with NF1, and compared them with women in the general
population of the United Kingdom, as follows. We obtained the
national annual age-specific rates of breast cancer in women in the
United Kingdom from the Cancer Research UK website (CRUK,
2014). We applied the age-specific rate ratios (that is, the relative
risks) for breast cancer associated with NF1 in our study to the
annual absolute risks in the general population of women. Our RRs
are based on small numbers and there is inevitable statistical
uncertainty about them. Accordingly, as well as calculating the
absolute risks on the basis of the point estimates of relative risks,
we also calculated absolute risks on the basis of the lower and
upper 95% confidence limits of relative risk.

RESULTS

In the total English population (B53 million people), we identified
58 cases of breast cancer during a period 1999–2011 among 3672
women hospitalised with NF1. Twenty-five cases of breast cancer
were diagnosed among women aged below 50, the earliest age at
which women in England are routinely invited for breast cancer
screening, and 33 cases of cancer in women aged 50 years and over.
We found one case of breast cancer in a woman with NF1under 30
years of age; 7 in women aged 30–39 (RR 6.53, 95% confidence
interval 2.6–13.5); 17 in women aged 40–49 (4.37, 2.5–7.0); 17 aged
50–59 (2.62, 1.5–4.2); 12 aged 60–69 (1.91, 1.0–3.3); 3 aged 70–79
(0.76, 0.2–2.2); and one aged 80þ . Among women with NF1, the
age-specific relative risks of breast cancer are higher in those aged
30–49 than in those aged 50 and over (Table 1).

Our estimates of absolute risks are shown in the Table 1. The
annual absolute risk in women aged 30–39 in the NF cohort (1 in
359) is comparable to that in women aged 50–59 in the general
population (1 in 363).

In our study there was only one man with NF1 and breast

cancer (in a cohort of 3067 men with NF1).

DISCUSSION

We found that women with NF1 develop breast cancer at younger
ages than the general female population.

These findings are consistent with reports published by other
groups (Gu¨ran and Safali, 2005; Sharif et al, 2007; Madanikia et al,
2012; Patil and Chamberlain, 2012).

Researchers from John Hopkins Hospital, using information
from the patient’s charts of the women with NF1, estimated that
the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for breast cancer was 4.4
among women aged under 50 years old (Madanikia et al, 2012).
Sharif et al (2007) found similarly elevated SIR of B4.9 among
young British women with NF1. Our estimates of the RR are very
similar to these: for example, among women aged 40–49 in our
study the RR was 4.4 (Table 1).

Women who develop breast cancer at a young age often have a
family history of breast cancer. However, the BRCA mutations are
detected only in 6–17% of women diagnosed with breast cancer
before the age of 36 years (Peto et al, 1999; Bayraktar et al, 2014).
Our study findings may help contribute to basic scientists’ under-
standing of
the pathophysiology of early-onset breast cancer,
particularly among noncarriers of the BRCA mutations. It is also
known that the NF1 and BRCA1 genes are located in close proximity
to each other on the long arm of the chromosome 17; and it is
therefore possible that, if mutations occur, they might affect both loci
(Ceccaroni et al, 2002). NF1-associated gene mutations have
themselves been suggested to have a role in the development of
breast cancer (Ogata et al, 2001; Ceccaroni et al, 2002; Gu¨ran and
Safali, 2005). These findings suggest that it might be reasonable to
consider NF1 alongside other hereditary breast cancer syndromes.
Thus, the NICE guidelines on early-onset breast cancer might need
to be extended to include women with NF1. However, further
evaluation would be needed to determine whether genetic counselling
and screening programmes would actually benefit these women.

There is a published case report of breast cancer in a young male
patient with NF1 (Wilson et al, 2004). Our data are insufficient to
draw conclusions about the relationship between NF1 and breast
cancer in men, since we found only one such case.

A strength of our study is that it was undertaken in a large
defined population: given the rarity of
the events described,
especially when divided by age, this is important. We were not able
to account for other risk factors associated with breast cancer, such
as parity and other
reproductive factors, use of hormone
replacement therapy and other medication, or smoking. Another
limitation is that our estimate of absolute risk of breast cancer is, as
described above, a rather broad approximation.

To conclude, the findings of an excess risk of breast cancer in
young women with NF1 might have implications for early breast
cancer screening programmes. If surveillance of breast cancer in
women with NF1 is considered, there may be a case for screening
from 30 years of age. However,
the benefits of a screening
programme need to be carefully weighed against
the risk of
exposing young women with NF1, which is a tumour-suppressor
syndrome, to radiation. Further study is needed to investigate

Neurofibromatosis and risk of breast cancer

whether young women with NF1 should be managed similarly to
those with familial breast cancer. Acknowledging the limitations of
epidemiological studies, a next step might be to design a clinical
study of
the prevalence of NF1-associated mutations among
women diagnosed with breast cancer, or to investigate NF1
prevalence from one of the ongoing clinical trials of familial breast
cancer. Finally, it is important to have more information about the
prognosis of breast cancer in young women with NF1.
