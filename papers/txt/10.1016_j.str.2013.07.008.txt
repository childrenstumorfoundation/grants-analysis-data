SUMMARY

The tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway controls
tissue homeostasis through balancing cell prolifera-
tion and apoptosis. Activation of the kinases Mst1
and Mst2 (Mst1/2) is a key upstream event in this
pathway and remains poorly understood. Mst1/2
and their critical
regulators RASSFs contain
Salvador/RASSF1A/Hippo (SARAH) domains that
can homo- and heterodimerize. Here, we report the
crystal structures of human Mst2 alone and bound
to RASSF5. Mst2 undergoes activation through
transautophosphorylation at
its activation loop,
which requires SARAH-mediated homodimerization.
RASSF5 disrupts Mst2 homodimer and blocks Mst2
autoactivation. Binding of RASSF5 to already acti-
vated Mst2, however, does not inhibit its kinase
activity. Thus, RASSF5 can act as an inhibitor or a
potential positive regulator of Mst2, depending on
whether it binds to Mst2 before or after activation-
loop phosphorylation. We propose that these tempo-
rally sensitive functions of RASSFs enable the Hippo
pathway to respond to and integrate diverse cellular
signals.

INTRODUCTION

The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis
through coordinately regulating cell growth, proliferation, and
death. This tumor-suppressive pathway was ﬁrst characterized
in Drosophila through genetic screens for mutations that caused
tissue overgrowth and was later shown to be conserved in mam-
mals (Badouel et al., 2009; Edgar, 2006; Halder and Johnson,
2011; Harvey and Tapon, 2007; Harvey et al., 2013; Pan, 2010;
Staley and Irvine, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010a). The core compo-
nents of the mammalian Hippo pathway include the Ste20 family
kinases Mst1 and Mst2 (Mst1/2), the scaffolding protein Salva-

dor (Sav1), the NDR family kinases Lats1 and Lats2 (Lats1/2),
and the adaptor protein Mob1. They form a central kinase
cascade to transduce signals from cell-surface receptors
(Avruch et al., 2012; Hergovich, 2012).

In the canonical Hippo kinase cascade, Mst1/2, in complex
with Sav1, phosphorylate and activate the Lats1/2-Mob1 com-
plexes, which then phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator
Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major downstream target of the
Hippo pathway (Dong et al., 2007; Hao et al., 2008; Hong and
Guan, 2012; Huang et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2007). Lats1/2-
mediated phosphorylation inhibits YAP in two ways. Phosphory-
lation of YAP at S127 by Lats1/2 creates a docking site for 14-3-3
proteins. Binding of 14-3-3 causes the cytoplasmic sequestra-
tion and inactivation of YAP (Dong et al., 2007; Hao et al.,
2008; Zhao et al., 2007). Phosphorylation of YAP at S381 by
Lats1/2 promotes its ubiquitination and degradation (Zhao
et al., 2010b).

When the Hippo pathway is turned off, YAP is dephosphory-
lated and translocates into the nucleus. Although YAP does
not contain a DNA-binding domain, it binds to the TEAD family
of transcription factors (which contains a sequence-speciﬁc
DNA-binding domain) to form a functional hybrid transcription
factor (Luo, 2010; Sudol et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2008). The
YAP-TEAD hybrid then activates the transcription of Hippo-
responsive genes that promote cell growth and proliferation
and inhibit apoptosis.

Tremendous progress has been made toward the dissection
of the molecular circuitry of the Hippo pathway and toward the
understanding of the pathophysiology of this pathway in multiple
organisms. By contrast, mechanistic and structural studies in
this area have lagged behind. In particular, the activation mech-
anisms of the core Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade remain
elusive. The upstream kinases Mst1/2 contain an N-terminal
kinase domain and a C-terminal SARAH (Salvador/RASSF1A/
Hippo) domain (Figure 1A). Mst1 and Mst2 can each form a
constitutive homodimer through the SARAH domain, and kinase
activation requires autophosphorylation of the activation loop
(T183 for Mst1 and T180 for Mst2) (Avruch et al., 2012; Creasy
et al., 1996). The Mst1/2 regulators, the Sav1 and RASSF
proteins, also contain SARAH domains (Figure 1A). The Mst1/2

SARAH domain can form a heterodimer with RASSF SARAH
(Hwang et al., 2007) and a heterotetramer with Sav1 SARAH
(data not shown). RASSF binding and Sav1 binding to Mst1/2
are mutually exclusive. How RASSFs and Sav1 regulate
Mst1/2 activation by forming different SARAH-domain-depen-
dent complexes is not understood.

RASSFs are important tumor suppressors (Avruch et al., 2009;
Richter et al., 2009). Their expression is frequently silenced in
human cancers through promoter methylation, and reintroduced
expression of RASSF1A or RASSF5 inhibits human tumor cell
growth (Aoyama et al., 2004). In addition, RASSF1A knockout
mice have increased spontaneous and chemical-induced tumor
susceptibility (Tommasi et al., 2005). The roles of RASSFs in the
tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway are far from clear, however.
In Drosophila, the only RASSF protein (dRASSF) forms a hetero-
dimer with Hippo through SARAH heterodimerization and pre-
vents Salvador from binding to Hippo, thereby inhibiting the
Hippo pathway (Polesello et al., 2006). Paradoxically, dRASSF
also antagonizes Ras signaling and,
in this capacity, has
tumor-suppressive function. In mammals, RASSF1, RASSF5,
and RASSF6 block Mst1/2 autophosphorylation and activation,

possibly through SARAH heterodimeriza-
tion (Ikeda et al., 2009; Khokhlatchev
et al., 2002; Praskova et al., 2004). On
the other hand, RASSFs can positively
regulate Mst1/2 (Guo et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2006). For example,
coexpression of RASSFs with Ras enhances the Mst1 kinase
activity. RASSF1A disrupts the interaction between proto-onco-
gene Raf1 and Mst2 and enhances the Mst2-Lats1 interaction to
promote apoptosis through the Hippo pathway (Matallanas
et al., 2007). RASSF2 associates with Mst1/2 through its SARAH
domain to stabilize and activate Mst1/2 (Cooper et al., 2009;
Song et al., 2010). Thus, in both Drosophila and mammals,
RASSFs appear to have both negative and positive regulatory
functions in the Hippo pathway.

Here, we report the crystal structures of the human Mst2
kinase domain and Mst2 in complex with the SARAH domain
of RASSF5. SARAH-mediated homodimerization of Mst2 is
critical for its transautophosphorylation and activation. RASSF5
disrupts this dimer interface and blocks Mst2 autoactivation.
It is interesting that binding of RASSF5 to Mst2 that has
already undergone autoactivation does not inhibit the kinase
activity of Mst2 toward the downstream substrate Mob1.
This lack of inhibition of active Mst2 might permit RASSF5 to
have a positive regulatory role in the Hippo signaling. Thus, the
order of RASSF5 binding and activation-loop phosphorylation

tions in the Hippo pathway.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Structure of the Mst2 Kinase Domain in Its Inactive State
The crystal structure of the activated Mst1 kinase domain
(Mst1KD), with two residues (T177 and T183) of its activation
loop phosphorylated, has recently been determined in a struc-
tural genomics effort. The structure of the Mst1/2 kinase domain
in its inactive, unphosphorylated state is unknown, however. We
thus created a catalytically inactive mutant of the human Mst2
kinase domain (Mst2KD/D146N), with its catalytic residue D146
mutated to an asparagine and determined its crystal structure
(Figure 1B). The structure was solved by molecular replacement

(MR) with the Mst1KD structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code
3COM) as the search model (Table 1). The kinase domain of
Mst2 in our structure adopts a canonical kinase fold, without
Mg2+-ATP bound to the active site located at the interface of
the N and C lobes. The salt bridge between K56 of strand b3
and E70 of helix aC (which is critical for ATP binding) is not pre-
sent in our unphosphorylated Mst2 structure. The overall struc-
tures of the Mst1 and Mst2 kinase domains are very similar,
with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.0 A˚ excluding
the activation loop, as expected from their 90% amino acid iden-
tity (Figure 1B). Comparison of the inactive and active states of
Mst1/2, however, reveals phosphorylation-dependent confor-
mational changes in its activation loop. The phosphorylated acti-
vation loop in the active Mst1 adopts an extended conformation
suitable for substrate binding (Figure 1C). As in other kinases that
require activation-loop phosphorylation for activation, the phos-
phoresidue in the activation loop (T183 in Mst1) makes favorable

electrostatic interactions with the arginine (R148 in Mst1) in the
catalytic loop. By contrast, the unphosphorylated activation
loop in the inactive Mst2 structure folds into an a helix that blocks
the active site of the kinase. Phosphorylation-mediated confor-
mational rearrangement of its activation loop thus underlies
Mst1/2 activation.

Mst2 Undergoes Activation through
Transautophosphorylation of T180
The full-length Mst1/2 or their kinase domains puriﬁed from bac-
teria are phosphorylated at their respective activation loops,
indicating that Mst1/2 can undergo autophosphorylation-depen-
dent activation and does not require upstream kinases for activa-
tion. To monitor the kinetics of Mst2 activation in vitro, we treated
puriﬁed, active Mst2 with l phosphatase to remove its activa-
tion-loop phosphorylation,
incubated the dephosphorylated
Mst2 with cold ATP for 1 hr, and blotted Mst2 with an antibody
against phospho-T180 Mst2 (a-Mst2 pT180). The full-length
Mst2 indeed underwent efﬁcient autophosphorylation at T180
in vitro (Figure 1D). By contrast, the Mst2 kinase domain alone
was inefﬁcient in T180 autophosphorylation, even at a higher
concentration (Figure 1E). Consistent with previous ﬁndings,
the full-length Mst2 eluted as a dimer during gel ﬁltration,
whereas the kinase domain of Mst2 migrated predominantly as
a monomer (Figure S1 available online). Our results suggest
that the C-terminal SARAH domain of Mst2 is critical for the
homodimerization of Mst2 and for T180 autophosphorylation
and Mst2 activation.

In the conventional model of the initial activation of kinases
that undergo activation-loop transautophosphorylation,
the
activation loop of an unphosphorylated kinase molecule tran-
siently adopts an active conformation and phosphorylates the
activation loop of a neighboring kinase molecule to fully activate

it (Pirruccello et al., 2006). We tested
whether Mst2 used a similar transauto-
phosphorylation mechanism. Mst2 un-
dergoes autophosphorylation on two residues: T174 and T180
in its activation loop. The T174A mutant of the Mst2 kinase
domain (Mst2KD/T174A) is fully active, whereas the T180A mutant
is largely inactive toward a key downstream substrate Mob1
(Figure 2A). Thus, T180 phosphorylation, but not T174 phosphor-
ylation, is critical for Mst2 activation. Mst2KD phosphorylated the
catalytically inactive Mst2KD/D146N, indicating that Mst2 could
undergo transautophosphorylation (Figures 2B and S2). It is
interesting that, despite not being able to permanently reach
the phosphorylated active state, the phosphorylation-deﬁcient
Mst2KD/T180A mutant phosphorylated Mst2KD/D146N to some
extent and,
in fact, more efﬁciently than it phosphorylated
Mob1 (Figure 2B). Thus, the unphosphorylated activation loop
of Mst2 might transiently adopt a conformation that is more
amenable for transautophosphorylation than for phosphoryla-
tion of a bona ﬁde substrate. Our results support the conven-
tional model for Mst2 transautoactivation.

Distinct Residues Mediate Mst2 Autophosphorylation
and Phosphorylation of Its Downstream Substrates
Despite being predominantly a monomer on gel ﬁltration col-
umns (Figure S1B), the Mst2 kinase domain exists as a homo-
dimer in the crystal (Figure 3A). The Mst2 kinase domain in
isolation indeed formed a weak dimer in solution, with a dissoci-
ation constant, KD, of 36 mM as measured by analytical ultracen-
trifugation (Figures 3B and S3; Table S1). To test whether the
weak dimerization of the Mst2 kinase domain involved the inter-
face observed in the crystal, we introduced mutations at this
interface and measured the dimerization afﬁnity. Unexpectedly,
none of the mutations appreciably altered the dimerization of
the Mst2 kinase domain in its active or inactive states (Table
S1). Therefore, this interface might not mediate the dimerization
seen in solution.

staining of Mob1 was shown in the lower panel.
See also Figure S3 and Table S1.

Because our mutations targeted residues close to the active
site, we tested the ability of these mutants to phosphorylate
the kinase-inactive Mst2KD/D146N or its downstream substrate
Mob1. Based on both 32P incorporation and anti-Mst2 pT180
blot, two mutations, I193A and F231A, severely inhibited Mst2
autophosphorylation at T180 (Figure 3C). Whereas the F231A
mutant was also defective in Mob1 phosphorylation, the I193A
mutant was fully functional in Mob1 phosphorylation (Figure 3D).
On the other hand, the M227A/I230A mutant was capable of un-
dergoing autophosphorylation at T180 but was inactive toward
Mob1. Therefore, Mst2 appears to use overlapping but distinct
surfaces to perform transautophosphorylation or phosphoryla-
tion of other substrates. I193 is speciﬁcally involved in autophos-
phorylation. We note that the I193A mutant puriﬁed from bacteria
still underwent autophosphorylation at T180, indicating that this
residue is not absolutely required for Mst2 autoactivation.

Of note,

the I193A mutation inhibited Mst2 autophos-
phorylation at T180, even in the context of the full-length Mst2
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Flag-Mst2
wild-type (WT), but not the I193A and F231A mutants, enhanced

the phosphorylation of HA-YAP and Myc-Lats1/2 in human cells
(Figures 4B and 4C), indicating that I193 was required for Mst2
activity and function in vivo.

The underlying reason for why Mst2 I193A undergoes auto-
phosphorylation in bacteria, but not in human cells, is unclear
at present, but this difference could be due to the presence of
phosphatases in human cells. A similar mutation in the Hippo
kinase domain has been shown to impair Hippo autophosphor-
ylation and activation in Drosophila, suggesting that the activa-
tion mechanism of Mst1/2 is conserved (Jin et al., 2012). Finally,
our results indicate that SARAH-mediated dimerization of Mst2
is critical for Mst2 autophosphorylation and activation. Even
though the Mst2 kinase domain in isolation forms a weak dimer,
there is no evidence supporting the importance of this dimeriza-
tion in Mst2 activation.

kinase and SARAH domains deleted (Mst2DL) had few sharp
peaks, indicating that the Mst2 linker was natively unfolded (Fig-
ure S4B). Therefore, Mst2 existed as a homodimer with two
juxtaposed kinase-domain heads and a SARAH coiled-coil
domain connected by ﬂexible linkers (Figure S4C). Mst2DL was
fully functional and capable of autophosphorylation (Figure S4D).
Similar to Mst2WT, Mst2DL formed a 1:1 heterodimer with
RASSF5 on a gel ﬁltration column (Figures S5A and S5B). We
thus used Mst2DL in subsequent structural studies.

We determined the structure of kinase-dead Mst2DL/D146N
bound to AMP-PNP and the SARAH domain of RASSF5, which
we refer to as Mst2-RASSF5 hereinafter for simplicity. Mst2-
RASSF5 again formed a dimer in crystal through the Mst2 kinase
domain (Figure 5A). It is intriguing that, although the dimer inter-
face of the Mst2 kinase domains also mainly involves aG, the
relative orientation of the two kinase domains and their speciﬁc
contacts are different from those observed in the active Mst1KD
(Figure S5C) or inactive Mst2KD structures, suggesting that the
dimer interfaces of Mst1/2 kinase heads in crystals might not
be speciﬁc.

The active site of Mst2-RASSF5 is well deﬁned, as the Mg2+
ion and AMP-PNP are clearly visible in the electron density
map. The kinase domain in Mst2-RASSF5 is very similar to the
Mst2 kinase alone, except
the activation-loop helix
observed in the Mst2 kinase structure has partially melted in

that

the Mst2-RASSF5 structure (Figure S5D). The K56–E70 salt
bridge between strand b3 and helix aC is also not formed in
the Mst2-RASSF5 structure. The residual
linker between the
kinase domain and SARAH domain is invisible and, pre-
sumably, disordered. The SARAH domains of Mst2 and
RASSF5 form a long antiparallel coiled coil. Because the SARAH
domains of Mst1 and Mst2 share 70% sequence identity (Fig-
ure 5B), they most likely share the same fold. The solution
structure of the Mst1 SARAH homodimer has been previously
determined (Figure 5C) (Hwang et al., 2007). The surfaces of
Mst1/2 SARAH for binding to RASSF5 SARAH (heterodimeriza-
tion) or
to another Mst1/2 SARAH (homodimerization) are
virtually identical (Figures 5C and 5D), readily explaining the
disruption of SARAH-mediated Mst2 homodimerization by
RASSF5 binding (Figure 5E).

Structural Determinants of Mst2 SARAH
Homodimerization and Mst2-RASSF5 SARAH
Heterodimerization
Addition of puriﬁed RASSF5 to the full-length Mst2 abolished its
autophosphorylation and activation in vitro (Figure 6A). To test
whether RASSF5 blocked Mst2 activation through disrupting
Mst2 homodimerization, we sought to obtain Mst2 mutants
that retained homodimerization but lost their ability to heterodi-
merize with RASSF5. Based on the Mst1 SARAH homodimer
structure, we designed the point mutations of all conserved
interface residues in the Mst2 SARAH domain (Figures 5B–5D).
We systematically mutated these interface residues in the
context of the full-length Mst2 and tested their dimerization in
an in vitro binding assay (Figures 6B and 6C). Brieﬂy, we cotrans-
lated HA- or Myc-Mst2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the pres-
ence of 35S-methionine and performed immunoprecipitation
with anti-HA beads. The WT HA-Mst2 efﬁciently pulled down

Myc-Mst2, conﬁrming that Mst2 indeed formed dimers. Among
the 14 mutants, Mst2 L448A, L452A, L455A, E462A, I463A,
Y470A, and L478A displayed minimal dimerization (Figure 6C),
indicating that the SARAH domain of Mst2 was the major dimer-
ization interface. The weak dimerization of the Mst2 kinase
domain was not detectable by this assay.

Compared to the WT Mst2, HA-Mst2 L445A, D456A, L466A,
R467A, R469A, K473A, and R474A still retained at least 30%
binding to their Myc-tagged counterparts, (Figures 6B and 6C).
We thus tested the binding of these 35S-labeled Mst2 mutants
to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RASSF5 SARAH. As ex-
pected, Mst2 WT bound speciﬁcally to GST-RASSF5-SARAH
but not to GST (Figures 6D and 6E). Six of the seven Mst2
mutants had stronger binding to RASSF5, presumably because
these mutations disrupted the Mst2 homodimerization more
severely than they disrupted Mst2-RASSF5 heterodimerization.
Only Mst2 K473A exhibited reduced RASSF5 binding, as

compared to Mst2 WT. Mst2 K473A still underwent efﬁcient
autophosphorylation and activation, which were not effectively
blocked by RASSF5 (Figure 6A). This result conﬁrms that
RASSF5 blocks Mst2 activation through disrupting SARAH-
mediated Mst2 homodimerization.

Functions of RASSFs in Mst1/2 Regulation
If RASSF5 simply prevents Mst2 autophosphorylation and
activation, then binding of RASSF5 to the already fully acti-
vated Mst2 kinase should have no effect on the kinase
activity.
in the presence of RASSF5, the activated
Mst2 phosphorylated either Mob1 or myelin basic protein
(MBP) in a manner similar to that of Mst2 alone (Figures 7A
and 7B). Therefore, RASSF5 does not inhibit the already acti-
vated Mst2 kinase.

Indeed,

Collectively, our results support the following model for Mst1/2
regulation by RASSFs (Figure 7C). When the Hippo pathway is

off, RASSFs form heterodimers with Mst1/2 through heterotypic
SARAH interactions, thus blocking the homodimerization and
transautophosphorylation of Mst1/2. In this context, RASSFs
act as inhibitors of apoptosis. When the Hippo pathway is
on, Mst1/2 undergoes homodimerization and autoactivation,
possibly through Sav1-dependent displacement of RASSFs.
RASSFs can then bind to already activated Mst1/2. This binding
does not inhibit the kinase activity of Mst1/2 but may instead
promote the function of Mst1/2 through unknown mechanisms.
In this capacity, RASSFs act as activators of apoptosis and
tumor suppressors. Thus, RASSFs are double-edged swords
in the Hippo pathway. Depending on the timing of their binding
to Mst1/2 relative to Mst1/2 autophosphorylation, RASSFs can
either function as inhibitors or activators of Mst1/2 and the Hippo
pathway.

Conclusions
The Hippo pathway is a major regulatory pathway of cell prolifer-
ation and survival. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway is inti-
mately linked to cancer. Our study provides key structural and
mechanistic insights into the activation of Mst1/2, the upstream
kinases in this pathway. In particular, we have revealed impor-
tant roles of RASSFs in regulating Mst1/2 in vitro. Binding of
RASSFs to unphosphorylated,
inactive Mst1/2 blocks their
autoactivation. Binding of RASSFs to the already activated
Mst1/2 does not
their kinase activities but may
simulate Mst1/2 function through other mechanisms. Our study
provides a potential explanation for the perplexing dual func-
tions of RASSFs in vivo. By virtue of their ability to interact
with both Mst1/2 and Ras proteins, RASSFs are at the intersec-
tion of the Hippo and Ras pathways. Temporal regulation of the

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Plasmids, Protein Expression, and Puriﬁcation
The kinase domain of human Mst2 (Mst2KD, residues 16–313) was cloned into
a modiﬁed pET28 vector (EMD Millipore) that included a tobacco etch virus
(TEV) cleavage site at the N terminus. The full-length Mst2 (Mst2FL, residues
9–491) and linker-deletion Mst2 (Mst2DL, residues 9–313 and 428–491) were
cloned into a modiﬁed pET29 vector (EMD Millipore) that included an N-termi-
nal His6 tag without a protease cleavage site. The C-terminal domain of Mst2
(Mst2CTD, residues 314–491) and the SARAH domain of human RASSF5
(RASSF5SARAH, residues 366–413) were cloned into a modiﬁed pGEX-6P vec-
tor (GE Healthcare) that included a TEV cleavage site at their N termini. The
Mst2 mutants were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Strata-
gene). All constructs were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing.

When expressed alone in bacteria, the yield of Mst2 was extremely low.
To obtain large quantities of soluble Mst2 proteins, we cotransformed the
pET28-Mst2KD, pET29-Mst2FL, or pET29-Mst2DL plasmid into BL21(DE3)
with pGEX-6p-Mst2CTD to produce N-terminal His6-tagged Mst2 proteins.
Mst2KD was puriﬁed with Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN) and cleaved with
TEV to remove the His6 tag. His6-Mst2FL and His6-Mst2DL were puriﬁed with
Ni2+-NTA agarose resin. These proteins were further puriﬁed by a Resource
Q anion exchange column and followed by a Superdex 200 gel ﬁltration col-
umn (GE Healthcare). Puriﬁed Mst2 proteins were concentrated to 20 mg/ml
in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and
5 mM TCEP.

The Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH complex was obtained by coexpression
of pET29-Mst2DL/D146N and pGEX-6p-RASSF5SARAH in the E. coli strain
BL21(DE3). Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH was puriﬁed with Glutathione Sephar-
ose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and cleaved with TEV to remove the GST
moiety. Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH was further puriﬁed by a Superdex
200 gel ﬁltration column and then concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer contain-
ing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM TCEP. The
selenomethionine-labeled Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH was produced using
the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method (Van Duyne et al., 1993).

Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH was crystallized at 20

C using the hanging-
drop vapor diffusion method with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-
Tris propane (pH 8.5), 200 mM Na2SO4, and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals
were cryo-protected with the reservoir solution supplemented with 25%
glycerol and then ﬂash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Native crystals diffracted to
a minimum Bragg spacing (dmin) of 3.05 A˚ and exhibited the symmetry of space
group C2, with cell dimensions of a = 123.4 A˚ , b = 237.1 A˚ , c = 95.9 A˚ , and

b = 100.7
and contained four Mst2-RASSF5 heterodimers per asymmetric
unit. The selenomethionine-derivatized Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH crystals
were obtained in the same way and had similar cell parameters. The selenome-
thionine-derivatized crystals only diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing of
3.55 A˚ . All crystals showed signiﬁcant anisotropic diffraction. Single-
wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data on the selenomethionine
Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH crystals were collected at 3.55 A˚ , with weak
anomalous signal present to about 5 A˚ .

All diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID (SBC-CAT) at the
Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA)
and processed with HKL3000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Phases for
Mst2KD/D146N were obtained by MR with Phaser using the crystal structure of
human Mst1 kinase domain (PDB code: 3COM) as the search model (McCoy
et al., 2007). Iterative model building and reﬁnement were performed with
COOT and Phenix, respectively (Adams et al., 2010; Emsley and Cowtan,
2004). The ﬁnal model for Mst2KD/D146N (Rwork = 19.3%, Rfree = 23.1%) con-
tained 1,646 residues in six monomers, 279 water molecules, and four glyc-
erols. Two residues, L33 and D164, are outliers in the Ramachandran plot as
deﬁned in the program MolProbity (Davis et al., 2007). Both are located in sur-
face loops with poor electron density.

Phases for Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH were ﬁrst obtained by MR with
Phaser using Mst2KD/D146N structure as the search model. Phenix was used
to build and reﬁne a partial model only containing the Mst2 kinase domain.
The resulting electron density map clearly showed several helices from the
SARAH domains, yet the primary sequence for these helices was impossible
to assign due to poor side chain density, and the density for the RASSF5SARAH
helices was weak and disconnected. The MR-SAD module of Phaser was used
to calculate initial phases to 3.6 A˚
from the MR solution and the known 36
selenium sites in the Mst2DL/D146N kinase domains from a selenium-SAD
experiment, and to locate the remaining 16 selenium sites in the SARAH

domains of Mst2DL/D146N. Iterative cycles of solvent ﬂattening and 4-fold
averaging in Parrot, automatic model building in Buccaneer, and phase calcu-
lation and reﬁnement in the MR-SAD module of Phaser resulted in a model
with 1,483 residues (89%) built and assigned (Winn et al., 2011). The side
chain assignment of RASSF5SARAH was further conﬁrmed by packing interac-
tions with the Mst2DL/D146N SARAH domain. Completion of the model and
ﬁnal reﬁnement was performed using the native data to 3.05 A˚ . The ﬁnal model
for Mst2DL/D146N-RASSF5SARAH (Rwork = 19.9%, Rfree = 24.4%) contained
1,551 residues in four monomers, four molecules of Mg2+-AMP-PNP, three
sodium ions, and nine sulfate ions. Three residues, E31, T174, and E311, are
outliers in the Ramachandran plot, as deﬁned in the program MolProbity,
and are located in surface loops with weak electron density. Data collection
and structure reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation
All sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were per-
C using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-I
formed in an An-50Ti rotor at 20
analytical ultracentrifuge. Protein samples (400 ml) in the gel ﬁltration buffer
(20 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP) at three different
concentrations in the range of 2–100 mM were placed in one sector of centri-
fugation cells that housed dual-sector charcoal-ﬁlled Epon centerpieces.
The same volumes of the gel ﬁltration buffer were placed in the other sector
of centerpieces as reference. The sealed centrifugation cells and the rotor
were incubated at the experimental temperature under vacuum for at least
2 hr prior to centrifugation. Samples were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm until the
boundary region reached the bottom of cells. Concentration proﬁles of the pro-
teins were monitored using the on-board absorption optical system tuned to
280 nm and, where appropriate, the Rayleigh interferometer. The partial spe-
ciﬁc volume (0.7421 ml/g) based on the amino acid sequence, the solution
density (1.00309 g/ml), and the viscosity (0.010177 P) of the buffer was calcu-
lated using SEDNTERP (Laue et al., 1992). Data were directly ﬁtted and
optimized to the monomer-dimer self-association model with the Marquardt-
Levenberg methods using the Lamm equation with explicit reaction kinetics
in SEDPHAT
(Brautigam,
2011; Schuck, 2003). A global analysis was performed for data sets obtained
at different protein concentrations to calculate the dissociation constant for
each protein sample.

NMR Spectroscopy
C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz four-
All NMR spectra were acquired at 30
channel spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-ﬁeld gradient triple resonance
probe using H2O/D2O 95:5 (v/v) as the solvent. Samples typically contained
0.1 mM 15N-labeled protein in the NMR buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 6.8), 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT). The data were processed and analyzed with NMRPipe and NMRView
(Delaglio et al., 1995; Johnson and Blevins, 1994).

In Vitro Kinase Assays and Autophosphorylation
For in vitro kinase assays, 0.025–0.4 mM Mst2 kinase or its mutants, either
alone or in complex with RASSF5, was incubated in the kinase buffer contain-
ing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT,
and 0.1 mCi/ml g-32P-ATP with 40 mM substrate (Mob1, or Mst2KD/D146N, or
MBP) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by
adding 53 SDS sample buffer and followed by boiling for 5 min in 100
C
water bath. The mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by
autoradiography.





For autophosphorylation experiments, the WT Mst2 protein puriﬁed from
E. coli was treated with lambda (l) protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs)
C for 40 min to remove the phosphorylation at T180. The reaction was
at 30
stopped by adding phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 to a ﬁnal concentration of
3 mM. The treated Mst2 was then incubated at room temperature in the kinase
buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP,
1 mM DTT, and 1 mM Na3VO4. At the indicated time intervals, aliquots were
removed and mixed with 53 SDS sample buffer. The autophosphorylation
product was detected by western blot using a speciﬁc antibody against
phospho-T180 of Mst2 (Cell Signaling) and quantiﬁed with the Odyssey LI-
COR imaging system.

Cell Culture and Transfection
HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid transfections were per-
formed with the Effectene reagent (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. HA-YAP, Flag-Mst2, Myc-Lats1, and Myc-Lats2 have been
described elsewhere (Dong et al., 2007). Flag-Mst2I193A and Flag-Mst2F231A
were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All clones
were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation was performed as
described elsewhere (Yu et al., 2010). The western blots were developed using
the Amersham ECL chemi-luminescence system (GE Healthcare).

In Vitro Binding Assays
To assay Mst2 homodimerization, same amounts of plasmids encoding Myc-
or HA-tagged Mst2 WT or point mutants were translated in reticulocyte lysate
in the presence of 35S-methionine. Afﬁ-Prep protein A beads (Bio-Rad) cova-
lently coupled to a-HA monoclonal antibodies (Roche) were incubated with
35S-labeled Mst2 and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) con-
taining 0.05% Tween. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed with a phosphor imager (Fujiﬁlm).

To assay the binding between human Mst2 and RASSF5 proteins, the full-
length WT or point mutants of Mst2 were translated in reticulocyte lysate in
the presence of 35S-methionine. Puriﬁed GST-RASSF5SARAH was bound to
incubated with 35S-labeled
glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare),
Mst2 proteins, and washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween.
The proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed
by autoradiography. Glutathione-agarose beads bound to GST were used
as controls.
