RASopathies are syndromes caused by gain-of-function mutations in the Ras signaling pathway. One of these con-
ditions, Costello syndrome (CS), is typically caused by an activating de novo germline mutation in HRAS and is
characterized by a wide range of cardiac, musculoskeletal, dermatological and developmental abnormalities.
We report that a majority of individuals with CS have hypo-mineralization of enamel, the outer covering of teeth,
and that similar defects are present in a CS mouse model. Comprehensive analysis of the mouse model revealed
that ameloblasts, the cells that generate enamel, lacked polarity, and the ameloblast progenitor cells were hyper-
proliferative. Ras signals through two main effector cascades, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. To determine through which pathway Ras affects enamel forma-
tion, inhibitors targeting either PI3K or MEK 1 and 2 (MEK 1/2), kinases in the MAPK pathway, were utilized.
MEK1/2 inhibition rescued the hypo-mineralized enamel, normalized the ameloblast polarity defect and restored
normal progenitor cell proliferation. In contrast, PI3K inhibition only corrected the progenitor cell proliferation
phenotype. We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the central role of Ras signaling in enamel formation in CS individuals
and present the mouse incisor as a model system to dissect the roles of the Ras effector pathways in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

The role of Ras signaling has been extensively studied in devel-
opment and disease, particularly in cancer, yet its function in
tooth development is not yet known. Receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) signaling upstream of Ras is activated by ﬁbroblast
growth factors (Fgfs), which are known to regulate epithelial –
mesenchymal interactions in the developing tooth (1). We
have previously reported that deletion of Sprouty genes, which
encode proteins that antagonize the Ras/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, results in changes in tooth

number and morphology (2 – 4), suggesting that Ras signaling
is important in developing teeth. However, the role of Ras and
its downstream effectors, including the MAPK and phosphatidy-
linositol-3-kinase, (PI3K) pathways, has not yet been explored in
tooth development and renewal.

Costello syndrome (CS) provides an ideal model to study the
effects of activated Ras signaling in development. CS is character-
ized by craniofacial malformations, dermatologic anomalies,
cardiac defects, musculoskeletal abnormalities, growth delay
and cognitive deﬁcits (5). CS is one of a number of RASopathies,
a group of syndromes that include neuroﬁbromatosis type 1

(NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), NS with multiple lentigines, ca-
pillary malformation-AV malformation syndrome, Legius syn-
drome and Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) (6). The
RASopathies are caused by mutations that increase signaling
through the Ras/MAPK pathway (6). In CS, individuals typically
have heterozygous, de novo germline mutations in HRAS that
result in the constitutive activation of Ras, although rarely
somatic mosaicism in the parental germline has been reported
as well (7, 8).

Multiple mouse models have been developed to study the
RASopathies. Here, we have utilized a CS mouse model expres-
sing a HRasG12V mutation (9). Although 80% of individuals with
CS carry an HRASG12S mutation (10 – 12), we utilized the avail-
able HRasG12V mouse model, which harbors the HRas mutation
most commonly found in cancer, because it phenocopies many
aspects of the syndrome, including growth delay, macrocephaly,
craniofacial anomalies and papilloma development (9).

We examined the teeth of individuals with CS and in CS
(HRasG12V) mice and observed that enamel was hypo-
mineralized in both human and mouse CS. Because human
teeth no longer possesses ameloblasts since they slough off after
crown formation is complete during tooth eruption, we cannot
study amelogenesis or enamel formation in human patients. To
systematically study the cellular mechanisms underlying the CS
enamel defect, we took advantage of the continuously growing
mouse incisor model (13–19). We discovered that in CS mice,
the proliferation and differentiation of enamel-producing amelo-
blasts and their precursors were compromised, and the inhibition
of MEK1/2 (MAPK) or PI3K rescued distinct aspects of the dental
phenotype. Our studies demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the central
role of Ras signaling in tooth development, and the utilization
of the mouse incisor model to dissect the roles of the distinct com-
ponents of Ras signaling.

RESULTS

Individuals with CS have defective enamel

Enamel hypoplasia has been mentioned in case reports of CS indi-
viduals (20, 21), and here, we analyze the enamel defect of CS in a
relatively large cohort of CS individuals. Because of the optical
properties of enamel, less dense enamel appears to be chalky
white and opaque to the human eye, whereas normal enamel
looks translucent. Therefore, the presence of white lesions is sug-
gestive of decreased enamel mineralization (22). The enamel of

nearly all CS participants examined (n ¼ 29; 88%) had focal

white lesions and striations, which are not normally present in
healthy enamel (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, pathologic wear, as
indicated by reduced cusps and/or cup-shaped lesions on the

cusps (Fig. 1C and D), was present in 56% (n ¼ 18) of CS

subjects. Such pathologic wear, not observed in unaffected indivi-
duals of the same age, suggested that CS individuals’ enamel was
less densely mineralized, and thus, more susceptible to abrasion
(Fig. 1C and D). In order to increase the contrast between the
mineralized and hypo-mineralized enamel areas, we obtained
photographs using a UV camera, which conﬁrmed that individuals
with CS had hypo-mineralized striated lesions, seen as dark
bands in the UV images, which were not present in controls
(Fig. 1E and F).

Control patient (A) had normal enamel, whereas 19-year-old affected female
(B) had demineralized white spot lesions and striations (black arrows). Control

shaped lesions (black arrows) on cusps. (E and F) UV ﬂash images of mandibular

tions (yellow arrows) in (F) indicated demineralized enamel. (G and H) SEM
images of enamel of exfoliated maxillary primary incisors showed that the hy-
droxyapatite crystals were less organized and not parallel in the affected CS in-
dividual (H) compared with control (G) as highlighted by the red and yellow
dashed lines (scale bar: 50 mm). Higher magniﬁcation images showed that the

To assess for the presence of structural enamel defects, scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on etched
enamel from exfoliated CS and age-matched control teeth.
Healthy enamel displayed a parallel arrangement of hydroxy-
apatite prisms spanning from the dentin – enamel
junction
(DEJ) to the enamel surface (Fig. 1G). In CS enamel, the orga-
nized, parallel pattern of hydroxyapatite prisms was absent,
and the orientation of rods was more irregular from the DEJ to

droxyapatite crystals that ﬁll the space between enamel rods in
normal enamel (Fig. 1G
).
Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (mCT) analysis of
exfoliated primary teeth showed that the enamel in CS subjects

CS (HrasG12V) mice have poorly mineralized

mCT was performed on hemi-mandibles of CS (HRasG12V) mice
(Fig. 2A). Coronal images at the ﬁrst molar were captured to de-
termine the volume, distribution and density of molar and incisor
′
enamel (Fig. 2A
). Normally, mice possess enamel on the crowns
of the three molars and the labial aspect of the incisor (Fig. 2B,
′
B
). However, the molars of CS mice showed little to
′′
no enamel (Fig. 2C, C
). In control mice, incisor
enamel was more dense at postnatal day (P) 70 than P21
′′′
(Fig. 2B
). In fact, at all stages analyzed, the CS incisor
′′′
enamel was less densely mineralized (Fig. 2C
). In con-
trols, enamel covered the entire labial surface of the incisor,
whereas in CS mutants, the total volume of enamel was decreased,
with enamel covering a decreased percent of the surface area of the
′′′
tooth (Fig. 2C

To determine whether enamel microstructure was disrupted in
CS mice, SEM analysis was performed on incisors of
12-week-old (P70) animals. In controls, the enamel rods were
highly organized, running parallel in the same plane from the
′
DEJ to the enamel surface (Fig. 2F and F
) similar to the
pattern observed in human teeth (Fig. 1G). This interdigitated
and highly organized pattern was lost in CS incisors, and the
enamel rods intersected at irregular angles and did not complete-
ly span the DEJ to the enamel surface (Fig. 2G and G
), similar to
what we observed in human CS teeth (Fig. 1H).

′

mCT imaging of CS mice also revealed large cysts in the bone
in the region of the third molar at P21 when compared with
control (n ¼ 3; Fig. 2B and C). Histological examination of

the cysts at P21 revealed that they were lined by epithelium inﬁl-
trated by ghost cells, or aneucleic cells with basophilic granules
(data not shown). The cysts were near, but not associated with,
the third molar, which is suggestive of calcifying odontogenic
cysts (23). Interestingly, these cysts were not observed at P70, in-

dicating that they resolved in adulthood (n ¼ 3; Fig. 2E).

CS (HrasG12V) ameloblasts are disorganized and have
abnormal cell polarity at the secretory and maturation stages

In order to determine the cause of the enamel defects in the CS
(HrasG12V) mice, the ameloblasts were examined using the
mouse incisor model. The rodent tooth is remarkable in that the
ameloblast progenitor cells exit the stem cell-containing cervical
loop (CL), proliferate as they move into the transit-amplifying
(TA) region and differentiate into ameloblasts. As the ameloblasts
move along the incisor, they transition from the secretory stage,
during which they secrete enamel proteins including amelogenin
(AMEL) and ameloblastin (AMBN) to form the enamel matrix
(24, 25), to the maturation stage, when ameloblasts secrete
proteins such as odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein
(ODAM/APIN) and amelotin (AMTN)
that enable the

mineralization of the enamel matrix (26, 27). Thus, the distinct
steps of amelogenesis can be observed in a ‘conveyor belt-like’
fashion along the length of the mouse incisor.

Normally, ameloblasts are highly organized in a single cell
layer on the labial aspect of the incisor (Fig. 3A and A
). Hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E) stained coronal sections in the region of
the ﬁrst molar from P70 control mice showed that the amelo-
blasts and underlying stratum intermedium (SI) cells were sepa-
′
rated by a clear border (Fig. 3B and B
). In addition, control
ameloblasts were polarized, with the nuclei located in the

′

nuclei. However, in a signiﬁcant number of CS ameloblasts,
the Golgi apparatus was mis-oriented basally relative to the
nucleus, demonstrating a lack of CS ameloblast polarity (Sup-
plementary Material, Fig. 2). Interestingly, there were no differ-
ences between control and CS mice in expression of the
hemi-desmosomal protein E-cadherin (28) or the desmosome-
associated protein PERP that are important in ameloblast – SI
attachment and necessary for proper enamel formation ((29);
data not shown).

When ameloblasts reach the maturation stage, the enamel
protein matrix is normally removed to allow proper mineraliza-
tion (30). In demineralized samples from control mouse incisors,
the empty enamel space between the ameloblasts and dentin con-
ﬁrmed the complete removal of enamel matrix (Fig. 3B). In con-
trast, CS mice showed residual enamel matrix, indicating that CS
ameloblasts did not completely remove the enamel matrix to form
properly mineralized enamel (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, qPCR
showed that maturation stage molars at P11 expressed decreased
levels of Amtn, Apin/Odam and Klk4, a gene encoding another
maturation stage enamel protein (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S3).

Treatment with MEK and PI3K inhibitors enhances enamel
deposition in control mice

In order to determine through which effector pathway HRAS acts
to regulate amelogenesis, mice were treated with MEK1/2
(PD0325901, Pﬁzer, New York, NY, USA) or PI3K
(GDC-0941, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) inhibitors.
The systemic inhibition of the signaling pathways by the speciﬁc
inhibitors was conﬁrmed by performing western blot analysis on
protein isolated from the liver (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).
We ﬁrst tested the effects of these inhibitors in control adult (P70)
mice. Of note, since we treated adult mice, only the enamel of the
incisor which grows continuously throughout the lifetime of the
animal was affected and not the molars since molar formation is
completed around P14 and erupted mouse molars do not possess
ameloblasts, like human teeth. Coronal mCT images showed
that mice treated with MEK or PI3K inhibitors for 28 days had
normal enamel density on the labial aspect of the incisor
′
(Fig. 4A
); however, the enamel formed earlier after
treatment with either of the inhibitors compared with vehicle-
treated control mice. In control mice, enamel was visible on the
labial aspect of the incisor near the ﬁrst molar, whereas enamel
appeared to be near the second molar with MEK inhibition and
near the third molar with PI3K inhibition (Fig. 4A, E and I). Al-
though the timing of enamel deposition differed, the incisor
enamel structure analyzed by SEM was the same with vehicle,
MEK and PI3K inhibitor treatments (Fig. 4B, F and J).

We next assessed the effects of the pathway-speciﬁc inhibitors in
CS adult mutant mice. Treatment of CS mice with the MEK in-
hibitor rescued the density, patterning and structure of enamel,
whereas PI3K inhibition only partially rescued the enamel
density and had no effect on the patterning or structure of
enamel. CS mice treated with the MEK inhibitor produced

niﬁcantly more often than in controls at both the secretory and
maturation stages (Fig. 3B

not only rescued the density and patterning of enamel, but also
restored the enamel microstructure comparable with the
control (Fig. 4B and H). Treatment with a PI3K inhibitor resulted
in the formation of enamel with slightly increased mineral
density compared with CS enamel but less dense than control
incisor, and thus, the rescue appeared to be less than with
MEK inhibition (Fig. 4C
). PI3K inhibition failed to
rescue the distribution of enamel, as the enamel did not cover
the entire labial aspect of the incisor, or the enamel structure,
because the enamel rod pattern was disorganized similar to CS
enamel (Fig. 4D and L). These studies using highly speciﬁc
antagonists demonstrate that hyperactive HRAS signals primar-
ily through MAPK to dysregulate enamel formation.

Underlying the rescue of the enamel mineralization defect was
the normalization of the morphology of the enamel-producing
ameloblasts. CS ameloblasts treated with the MEK inhibitor
were normally polarized, with nuclei in the basal portion of the
′
cell similar to control mice (Fig. 5A
and M). In contrast,
PI3K inhibition did not rescue polarity of CS ameloblasts
′
(Fig. 5D
and M). Also, in both vehicle-treated and PI3K-inhib-
ited CS incisors, there was a residual enamel matrix in the enamel
space (Fig. 5D and J). In 75% of samples, areas of sequestered
enamel matrix were surrounded by disorganized ameloblasts

(Fig. 5D) on the labial aspect of the CS incisor. These sequestered
areas of matrix were presumably precursors of the enamel pearls,
which are ectopic enamel spheres located primarily on the molars
of human patients (31), observed on the lateral aspect of CS inci-
sors treated with vehicle or PI3K inhibitor but not MEK inhibitor
′
(Fig. 4C
). In contrast, areas of sequestered enamel
matrix were not observed in CS incisors treated with a MEK
inhibitor, although they were present in incisors treated with a
PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 5G and J).

MEK inhibition also appeared to rescue the ability of CS ame-
loblasts to differentiate and secrete enamel proteins. Ameloblast
progenitors differentiate as they move along the incisor and
secrete enamel matrix proteins once they have differentiated
into ameloblasts. By measuring the distance from the CL to
the start of expression of enamel proteins such as AMEL and
AMBN, we can determine whether ameloblast differentiation
is accelerated or delayed. In CS mice, there was an increase in
the distance between the CL region and the appearance of the
enamel protein AMEL compared with controls, suggesting
that CS ameloblasts show a delay in enamel protein expression
and thus have delayed differentiation (Fig. 5B, E and N). Treat-
ment with a MEK inhibitor rescued this delayed expression, and
CS ameloblasts began to secrete AMEL at the same location as
control (Fig. 5H and N). In contrast, PI3K treatment of CS
mice did not rescue the delay in the appearance of enamel pro-

MEK or PI3K inhibition rescues the hyperproliferative
progenitor phenotype in CS (HrasG12V) mice

The increase in ameloblast number at the secretory and matur-
ation stages in CS mice was correlated with increased prolifer-
ation of progenitor cells in the CL and TA region compared
with control (Fig. 6B and C). In the CS mouse CL/TA region,
25% of cells were proliferative, compared with 12% of cells in
control mice (Fig. 6B, C and H). In addition, the length of the
TA region was signiﬁcantly shorter in CS mice compared with
controls (Fig. 6B, C and I). In control mice, MEK and PI3K in-
hibition decreased proliferation in the CL/TA and decreased
the length of the TA region signiﬁcantly (Fig. 6B, D and F).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in proliferation or TA zone
length between MEK- and PI3K-treated control mice (Fig. 6H
and I). MEK inhibition of CS mice rescued the hyperprolifera-
tive phenotype, reducing proliferation to levels observed in
control mice (Fig. 6B and E). However, the length of the TA
region was not rescued (Fig. 6I). PI3K-treated CS mice
showed reduced proliferation levels even below that of controls
(Fig. 6B and G), and the TA region was signiﬁcantly shorter than
vehicle-treated control and CS mice (Fig. 6I).

DISCUSSION

The RASopathies are a group of syndromes estimated to affect
1 in 1000 live births. There are numerous morbidities associated
with these syndromes, and presently, effective therapies are
lacking. Although the role of Ras signaling has been studied in
the development of several organs, almost nothing is known
about its role during tooth development and renewal. Our ana-
lyses of both humans with CS and a CS mouse model revealed
that activated HRAS negatively regulates enamel formation.
Speciﬁcally, CS individuals with activated Ras signaling pre-
sented with hypo-mineralized, disorganized enamel, and a
similar enamel phenotype was observed in CS mice. CS amelo-
blast progenitor cells were hyperproliferative, and CS amelo-
blasts lacked cell polarity. Furthermore, attenuation of the
MAPK pathway led to the rescue of the enamel and ameloblast
phenotypes, whereas modulation of either MAPK or PI3K sig-
naling prevented progenitor cell hyperproliferation in CS mice.
The role of RTK, and particularly Fgf, signaling has been
studied previously in tooth development, but the focus has
been on tooth morphogenesis. Only a few studies have explored
Fgf signaling in enamel formation, and thus, little is known about
the role of RTK or downstream Ras signaling in enamel forma-
tion. Inactivation of Fgfr1 in the epithelium resulted in dysfunc-
tional ameloblasts that produced disorganized enamel (32).
Overexpression of Fgf2 in cultured embryonic molars resulted
in decreased expression of amelogenin, while inhibition of
FGF2 increased amelogenin expression and enamel formation
(33). Interestingly, other Ras superfamily members have been

shown to play a role in amelogenesis, including Rac, a GTPase
involved in cytoskeletal remodeling that is directly activated
by PI3K (34). Conditional inactivation of Rac1 in the epithelium
resulted in ameloblasts that expressed decreased levels of

8

amelogenin and lost attachment to the secreted enamel matrix,
resulting in hypo-mineralized enamel (35). Thus, it is possible
that activated HRAS disrupts Rac1 signaling, which may
result in ameloblast dysfunction and hypo-mineralized enamel
in CS.

Ras is thought to play an important role in cell polarity, prolif-
eration and differentiation, but studies to address the mechanistic
role of Ras signaling in cell biology have largely been performed
in vitro. For example, tissue culture studies have shown that ac-
tivation of KRAS and BRAF in a colon cancer cell line perturbs
the polarity of cyst structures (36), and activation of HRAS in
neuronal cell culture causes loss of polarity and multiple axon
formation (37). Downstream of Ras, PI3K signaling has been
shown to localize Rac and Cdc42 to the leading edge of cells
undergoing chemotaxis to induce actin polymerization there
(38), and in breast epithelial tumor cells, PI3K activates Rac,
which results in loss of polarity (39). Only recently have inves-
tigators begun to study the role of Ras in cell polarity in vivo.
A recent study showed that ERK controls spindle orientation
during cell division in the developing lung (40). In our study,
the loss of ameloblast polarity in CS mice was rescued by treat-
ment with MEK but not PI3K inhibition, suggesting that, in the
incisor, hyperactive Ras disrupts ameloblast polarity through
MAPK. The mechanistic role that Ras plays in epithelial cell po-
larity is still unclear, and ameloblasts may serve as a useful
model to further understand the role of Ras in the establishment
and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity in vivo.

In vitro studies have shown that p-ERK and p-AKT regulate
proliferation by decreasing p27kip1 and p21cip1 levels to allow
progression from G0 to S phase (41, 42). In the CS mouse
incisor, proliferation in the CL and TA region was increased.
MEK inhibition reduced proliferation to control levels, and
PI3K inhibition reduced it even further. Thus, both MAPK and
PI3K signaling are important in proliferation, and in CS, PI3K
may have a larger role than MAPK in proliferation. Ras may
also play a role in cell differentiation, as in the case of a
Nf12/2 mouse model, in which increased differentiation of neu-
roblasts into glial cells was observed, and the increased differen-
tiation was rescued by inhibiting ERK (43). We found that
p-ERK levels were high in the CS incisor compared with the
low levels in control incisors, indicating that a low level of
p-ERK may be necessary for the ameloblast progenitors to exit
the cell cycle and differentiate. MEK inhibition rescued the
delay in ameloblast differentiation in CS mice and thus, in
the CS mutant, consistently high levels of p-ERK result in
hyper-proliferative progenitor cells and delay in ameloblast
differentiation.

A number of inhibitors have been developed to target Ras and its
effectors to treat cancer (reviewed in 44). These same inhibitors are
potentially useful for treating RASopathies (45), and our study is
the ﬁrst to report modulation of the Ras pathway with inhibitors
in CS. This concept has recently been explored in animal models
of other RASopathies. For example, treatment of neuroﬁbroma-
tosis type 1 (NF1) mouse models with an MEK inhibitor
(PD0325901) reduced the growth and proliferation of neuroﬁbro-
mas (46) and abrogated the myeloproliferative disease in these
mice (47). In a NS mouse model with an activating mutation in
SHP2, MEK inhibition with U0126 ameliorated craniofacial
defects and rescued skull shape and size (48), and in another
SOS gain-of-function NS mouse model, treatment with a MEK

inhibitor (PD0325901) reduced embryonic lethality and rescued
heart defects (49). A CFC zebraﬁsh model expressing a kinase-
activating BRAFQ257R allele or kinase-inactivating BRAFG596V
allele developed craniofacial anomalies, and moreover, these
defects were ameliorated by treatment with low doses of a MEK
inhibitor at early stages of development (50). Interestingly, these
studies focused on the role of MAPK signaling in NF1, NS and
CFC, and very little work has been done to examine PI3K/AKT
signaling in any of the RASopathies.

By comparing the distinct dental phenotypes found in the
various RASopathies, we can obtain further insights into the
role of the Ras pathway in human teeth. For example, whereas
activating mutations in HRAS cause CS, individuals with CFC
harbor activating mutations in the kinases BRAF, MEK1 or
MEK2, which function downstream of HRAS (51, 52). Our in-
hibitor studies in the CS mouse model revealed that modulating
the MAPK pathway rescued the enamel phenotype, which would
suggest that CFC individuals with activating mutations in the
MAPK pathway would have an enamel defect. However, in con-
trast to the enamel defects in CS individuals, CFC enamel
appeared to be clinically normal (53), and SEM data showed
that the structure of CFC enamel was normal (data not shown).
Thus, increased Ras signaling in CS versus hyperactivation of
MAPK signaling in CFC individuals has different effects on
cells in the developing tooth, and whether this is due to quantita-
tive differences in the levels of signaling or to qualitative differ-
ences in signaling outputs will be important future topics to
explore. Data from clinical studies of other RASopathies indi-
cate that additional pathways downstream of Ras, including
PI3K, or pathways that crosstalk with the Ras/MAPK pathway
also play a role in amelogenesis. For example, individuals with
Tuberous Sclerosis, which is caused by mutations in the AKT
targets TSC1 or TSC2, have de-mineralized pits in the enamel
surface (54); interestingly, this phenotype is different from the
generalized hypo-mineralized enamel defect in CS. These data
suggest a role for PI3K in tooth development, and that dysregu-
lation of PI3K signaling may disrupt enamel formation. Further
studies of RASopathies, both in terms of clinical phenotyping of
patients and through utilization of mouse models for mechanistic
studies, will help to dissect the role of Ras signaling in amelogen-
esis and other tissues.

Because the tooth, like most other organs, develops through
reciprocal epithelial –mesenchymal interactions (55, 56), knowl-
edge gained by studying tooth development may be generalizable
to other organs. Thus, dissecting the function of the Ras pathway
and its many effectors, including MAPK and PI3K, in the teeth of
both humans and mice will not only advance our knowledge of
signaling in the tooth, but also will provide information on the in-
tricacies of Ras signaling in general, which will in turn advance
progress towards treatment of the RASopathies.

certiﬁed medical geneticist (K.A.R. or O.D.K.) based on clinical
features. All 41 participants enrolled in our study were HRAS
mutation positive. The cohort consisted of 21 males and
20 females. The average age of the cohort was 11 years, with a
range of 1 – 35 years of age. The majority of the cohort reported
Caucasian race (80%), but also included were Latino (10%),
African (5%), Asian (2%) and Middle Eastern (2%) individuals.
A written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Com-
plete intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed by a
licensed dentist (A.F.G.). Examinations included frontal and
side view craniofacial photographs, intra-oral photographs,
review of radiographs (including panoramic, periapical and
bitewing radiographs) and dental records provided by the partici-
pant, and alginate dental impressions. Primary teeth exfoliated
or naturally lost (not extracted due to caries or to address
spacing) were collected from patients. UV images were taken
with an Olympus E-620 camera (Center Valley, PA, USA) and
a Pentax Ultra-Achromatic Takumar Quartz lens (Denver, CO,
USA), which heightened the contrast between areas of minera-
lized and de-mineralized enamel.

Mouse husbandry and inhibitor treatment

All experiments involving mice were conducted in accordance
with protocols approved by the University of California,
San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
CS (HrasG12V) mice were bred and genotyped as previously
described (9). PD0325901 (Pﬁzer) and GDC0941 (Genentech)
were formulated in 0.5% (w/v) (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose
(HPMT; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). PD0325901 was administered to
12-week-old mice by oral gavage at 12.5 mg/kg and GDC0941 at
75 mg/kg per mouse once per day for 28 days. Minimal side
effects, including weight loss, were observed and monitored in
mice systemically administered PD0325901 or GDC0941.

mCT and SEM analysis of exfoliated human and mouse teeth

mCT was performed on human teeth and mouse hemi-mandibles.
For patient samples, 1 exfoliated primary maxillary central incisor
from a CS individual and 1 age-matched control tooth were col-
lected and stored dry at room temperature. For mouse samples,
hemi-mandibles from P21 and P70 control and CS (HrasG12V)
mice were dissected, cleaned of excess tissue and ﬁxed overnight
in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by dehydration in 70%
ethanol. Human and mouse samples were scanned using a micro-
focused X-ray tomographic system (MicroXCT-200, Xradia,
Pleasanton, CA), at 55 kV and 144 mA. 2000 projection images
at an exposure time of 13 s with a linear magniﬁcation of 2X
were taken. The ﬁnal pixel size was 20.5 mm. The volume was
reconstructed using a back projection ﬁltered algorithm
(XRadia). Following reconstruction, 3D image processing and
analysis were carried out using MicroView (Version 5.2.2, GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and Amira (Version 5.3, Visualiza-
tion Sciences Group, Burlington, MA) software. A 700 mm trans-
verse section (35 slices) of the incisor, adjacent to the second
molar, was used to measure the following parameters: enamel
volume and enamel coverage, which is deﬁned by the ratio of
enamel area to tooth area.

SEM was performed on exfoliated patient teeth and mouse
hemi-mandibles. For patient samples, two exfoliated primary

teeth (maxillary central and lateral incisor) from two CS indivi-
duals and one exfoliated age-matched control maxillary central
incisor were collected and stored dry at room temperature. For
mouse samples, hemi-mandibles from 12-week-old control and
CS mice were dissected free of soft and connective tissue, ﬁxed
in 4% PFA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight, then
dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and dried in a vacuum des-
iccator. After initial treatment, mouse and human samples were
treated the same. Samples were embedded in epoxy resin (resin
105 and hardener 205 at a ratio of 5:1 w/w, WestSystem, Bay
City, MI, USA), ground to the desired thickness on a plate
grinder (EXAKT 400CS, Norderstedt, Germany) using 800 grit
silicon carbide paper and polished with 2000 and 4000 grit
silicon carbide paper (Hermes Abrasives, Mississauga, ON,
Canada). The exposed tissue was etched with 10% phosphoric
acid for 30 s, rinsed with water and dried in a vacuum desiccator.
Samples were mounted on SEM stubs with carbon tape, surfaces
coated with 7 nm gold using a sputter coating machine (Desk II,
Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ, USA) and imaged in a
Philips SEM instrument (XL30 ESEM, Philips, Andover, MA,
USA) operating at a beam energy of 20 keV in secondary electron
or backscatter mode. Images were processed using Adobe Photo-
shop CS5.1 to adjust upper and lower limits of input levels in gray-
scale mode and to apply auto balance and auto contrast settings.

Histological analysis of mouse teeth

Postnatal day 2, 21 and 70 CS and control mice were euthanized
and mandibles were removed and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldahyde
overnight. Mandibles were then decalciﬁed in 0.5M EDTA for 7–
16 days, dehydrated, embedded in parafﬁn and serially sectioned
sagitally or coronally on a Leica microtome at 7 mM. Samples
were stained with H&E and imaged at 20× and 40× on a Leica

upright microscope. Quantiﬁcation was done using ImageJ soft-
ware (58) and statistical signiﬁcance was determined using Stu-
dent’s T-test. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed
following standard protocols using antibodies against GM-130
(Cell Signaling #2296, Danvers, MA, 1:500), amelogenin
(Santa Cruz #32892, Dallas, TX, 1:250, USA) and p-ERK (Cell
Signaling #9101, 1:250). For proliferation analysis, 10-week
control and CS mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg
of BrdU 1.5 h prior to euthanization, and IHC was performed
using an antibody against BrdU (Abcam #6326, Cambridge,
MA, 1:500, USA). The number of nuclei and BrdU cells in the
CL and TA region was determined using pixel quantiﬁcation in
Adobe Illustrator.

RNA isolation and qPCR

Mandibular molars were removed from P11 control and CS
mandibles in PBS and transferred to Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM) at 48C. RNA was extracted from the
tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD,
USA). RNA was then quantiﬁed using the NanoDrop 2000
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, Wilmington, DE, USA), and complemen-
tary DNA was made with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase.
qPCR were performed using the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix
(Promega, Madison, WI) in a Mastercycler Realplex (Eppen-
dorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA). PrimeTime qPCR primers (Inte-
grated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) for each of

the genes of interest were used (sequences available upon
request). qPCR conditions were as follows: 958C, 2 min; 40
cycles at 958C, 15 s; 608C, 15 s; 688C, 20 s; followed by a
melting curve gradient. Expression levels of the genes of interest
were normalized to levels of L19 and are presented as relative
levels to control.

Western blot hybridization

Liver tissue was collected, snap-frozen and homogenized in cell
lysis buffer with the addition of a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and soluble protein
quantiﬁed by the Bradford method. 2.5 mg of protein was sub-
jected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a NuPAGE
Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) and transferred to the BVDF membrane. Western
blot hybridization was performed using standard protocols.
Blots were probed with antibodies to p-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling
#2338), p-ERK (Cell Signaling #9101), total ERK (Cell Signaling
#9102), p-AKT (Cell Signaling #9271) and total AKT (Cell Sig-
naling #9272). The antibody to GAPDH (#AM4300, Ambion,
Austin, TX) was used as a protein loading control.
