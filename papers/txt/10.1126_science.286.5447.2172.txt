corneas (Fig. 4, D to F). These results showed
that the corneal equivalents had an active re-
sponse to different grades of injury, an impor-
tant functional characteristic of human corneas.
These engineered corneal equivalents
have immediate applications as human ocular
irritancy models for evaluating new chemi-
cals and drugs, as alternatives to animals
(30), and in drug efficacy testing such as for
wound healing. The corneal equivalents can
also be used in biomedical research, for exam-
ple, to study wound healing and cell-matrix
interactions. This
technology provides a
strong basis for the development of tempo-
rary or permanent cornea replacements with
low rejection rates. Future research could
lead to readily available, complex engineered
tissues that reproduce their natural human
counterparts and are suitable for implants,
transplants, and biomedical research.

Mouse Models of Tumor

Development in

Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis Type 1

Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent familial cancer syndrome re-
sulting from germ line mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Hallmark
features of the disease are the development of benign peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (neuro(cid:222)bromas), which can progress to malignancy. Unlike humans,
mice that are heterozygous for a mutation in Nf1 do not develop neuro(cid:222)bromas.
However, as described here, chimeric mice composed in part of Nf12/2 cells
do, which demonstrates that loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele is rate-limiting in
tumor formation. In addition, mice that carry linked germ line mutations in Nf1
and p53 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which
supports a cooperative and causal role for p53 mutations in MPNST develop-
ment. These two mouse models provide the means to address fundamental
aspects of disease development and to test therapeutic strategies.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) affects about
1 in 3500 individuals worldwide (1). The
hallmark clinical feature of the disease is

development of multiple benign neurofibro-
mas, which can be debilitating, severely dis-
figuring, and, in some patients, progress to

malignancy (2). NF1 patients are also predis-
posed to developing optic pathway gliomas,
pheochromocytomas, and myeloid leukemia
as well as several symptoms unrelated to
cancer (3).

family that

The NF1-encoded protein neurofibromin
is a member of the GTPase-activating protein
(GAP)
includes mammalian
p120GAP and the yeast IRA proteins (4). Like
p120GAP, neurofibromin can stimulate the
GTPase activity of Ras in vitro and in vivo
(5). Because most mutations in the NF1 gene
in patients are predicted to result in loss of
function, deregulation of Ras-mediated sig-
naling is likely to contribute to the pathology
of NF1 (6).

Although NF1 appears to be a classic
tumor suppressor gene, the molecular mech-
anism underlying tumor development in NF1
has been obscure. Although second hit muta-
tions affecting the inherited wild-type NF1
allele have been clearly identified in the my-
eloid leukemias and pheochromocytomas in
NF1 patients (7), such mutations have been
reported for only a small number of neurofi-
bromas (8). The difficulty in detecting muta-
tions may be due in part to the complex
nature of these lesions, which are composed
of multiple cell types, not all of which are
expected to develop a second mutation (2).
However, it also has been suggested that NF1
heterozygosity may be sufficient for develop-
ment of benign neurofibromas (haplo-insuf-
ficiency), with full loss of NF1 function be-
ing restricted to the progression to MPNSTs
(9).

Heterozygous mutant (Nf11/2) animals
are predisposed to a number of tumor types;
however,
they do not develop peripheral
nerve sheath tumors or other characteristic
symptoms of human NF1 (10, 11). To test the
possibility that a mutation in the wild-type
Nf1 allele is required and rate-limiting in the
formation of neurofibromas in Nf11/2 mice,
we generated chimeric mice that were partial-
ly composed of Nf12/2 cells. Germ line ho-
mozygosity for a Nf1 mutation (Nf12/2) re-
sults in embryonic lethality at about day 14 of
gestation (10, 11). We also developed a mod-
el of MPNST formation by generating mice
with combined mutations in Nf1 and p53.
These two models are described below.

We created two Nf1-deficient embryonic

stem cell (ES) lines by successive rounds of
gene targeting and injected the cells into
C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric
mice (12). We analyzed 18 chimeric adults,
which fell into three phenotypic classes, in
this study (13). The subset of chimeras (n 5
4) that exhibited the highest degree of chi-
merism died by 1 month of age of unknown
causes. The two animals that exhibited the
lowest degree of chimerism (less than 15%

by coat color) lived a typical life span and no
unusual pathology was observed upon nec-
ropsy. Most animals (12/18) fell into the third
phenotypic class: they exhibited a moderate
degree of chimerism, frequent myelodyspla-
sia, and progressive neuromotor defects. The
life span of these animals varied from 2 to 26
months. Histological analysis of this subset
of mice revealed the presence of neurofibro-
mas in every animal (14). We detected mul-

tiple tumors (10 to 100 per mouse), which
usually emanated from the dorsal root ganglia
(Fig. 1, A and B) or peripheral nerves in the
limbs (Fig. 1C). Notably, only plexiform neu-
rofibromas (those growing along the plexus
of internal peripheral nerves) were observed;
dermal neurofibromas, which are more com-
mon in NF1 patients, were not detected. His-
tologically, the lesions exhibited the classic
features of human neurofibromas (15). Most
tumors were not visible macroscopically;
thus, the number of tumors per animal was
probably underestimated. In two chimeras,
however, tumors on the trigeminal nerve and
in the tongue were visible upon dissection.

The contribution of Nf12/2 cells in the
neurofibromas in these mice was assessed by
using Nf12/2 ES cells containing a b-galac-
tosidase (b-gal) expressing transgene (16).
Five chimeras were produced with these
cells. Two of the three highly chimeric ani-
mals developed multiple neurofibromas. In
all cases, near uniform b-gal expression was
observed in the tumors, demonstrating exten-
sive contribution of Nf12/2 cells (Fig. 1D).
We have not detected significant recruitment
of wild-type cells into these lesions as might
have been expected given the multicellular
nature of human neurofibromas (see below).
However,
the sensitivity of 5-bromo-4-

R E P O R T S

chloro-3-indolyl b-D-galactopyranoside (X-
Gal) staining is not sufficient to rule out a
low-level contribution of wild-type cells in
this model.

Human neurofibromas contain a variety of
cell types found in normal peripheral nerve
including Schwann cells, perineurial cells,
fibroblasts, and neurons (15). We used elec-
tron microscopy (EM) to determine the cel-
lular constituents of the lesions in this mouse
model. Figure 2A illustrates the overall ultra-
structural appearance of a neurofibroma in this
model. As in human neurofibromas Schwann
cells were the most common cell type present
(Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, Schwann cells
(or their precursors) are believed to be the ini-
tiating cell type [the cell type that undergoes
loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] in human tu-
mors. Cells exhibiting features of perineurial
cells were also observed by EM (Fig. 2D).
Taken together with the histological analysis,
these data demonstrate a close similarity be-
tween the lesions in Nf12/2: Nf11/1 chimeras
and human neurofibromas.

These lesions were further characterized by
immunohistochemistry with an antibody recog-
nizing S100, a protein expressed in mature
Schwann cells and in most human neurofibro-
mas and MPNSTs (17). As illustrated by the
tumor shown in Fig. 1, E and G, S100-positive

cells aligned in parallel arrays containing multiple pinocytotic vesicles and a basal lamina were also

Schwann cells were observed exclusively asso-
ciated with entrapped nerves (center) and were
not found in the surrounding neoplastic tissue.
In larger tumors in which the original nerve was
disrupted (for example, Fig. 1, F and H), sparse
S100 staining, associated with nerve remnants
in the center of the lesion, were occasionally
observed (Fig. 1H, right). In all cases (n 5 25),
only minimal S100 staining was observed in the
lesion itself. The presence of S100-negative
Schwann cells in the neurofibromas may be
explained by their development within this
model system, in which Nf1 2/2 cells are intro-
duced at an early developmental stage (equiv-
alent to E3.5). It is possible that the absence of
S100 expression in these neurofibromas reflects
a requirement for Nf1 function in the differen-
tiation of neural crest–derived precursors to
S100-expressing Schwann cells in vivo. Indeed,
neurofibromin is expressed early in Schwann
cell differentiation in the mouse, 2 to 3 days
before the onset of S100 expression (18). In
contrast, in NF1 patients, neurofibromas arise
from cells that are initially heterozygous for an
NF1 mutation. Cells within the human neurofi-
bromas would be expected to become NF12/2,
but in many cases this might occur after the
onset of S100 expression, accounting for the
high percentage of S100-positive neurofibro-
mas in humans.

We next addressed the development of
MPNSTs. Because these malignant tumors
are often found emanating from primary
plexiform benign lesions (2, 15), it is thought
that additional (probably genetic) events are
involved in the progression to malignancy. In
fact, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor
gene have been detected in human MPNSTs
and therefore have been implicated in this
progression step (19). As a means of creating
a model for MPNST formation and establish-
ing a causal role for p53 mutations in the
malignant lesions, mice with germ line mu-
tations in Nf1 and p53 were generated on a
mixed (129/sv 3 C57BL/6) genetic back-
ground. Because Nf1 and p53 are linked on
chromosome 11 in mice (20), we initially
generated animals carrying the Nf1 and p53
mutations on opposite chromosomes (NP
trans) by crossing Nf11/2 and p531/2 mice.
We also crossed these NP trans animals to
wild-type animals to generate mice with both
mutations on chromosome 11 (NP cis), which
arise after meiotic recombination. Because
complete chromosomal loss is the most com-
mon mutational mechanism by which sec-
ond-hit mutations occur in mice (21), we
expected most of these NP trans mice to
undergo LOH at either the Nf1 or the p53
locus (but not both); we also thought this
population of mice would exhibit a tumor
phenotype reminiscent of the Nf11/2 and
p531/2 parental animals (10, 22). In the NP
cis mice, however, a chromosomal
loss
would be expected to result in LOH at both

tumor suppressor loci simultaneously (a phe-
nomenon we term co-LOH), resulting in cells
deficient for both Nf1 and p53.

As expected, NP trans animals succumbed
to tumors more rapidly than mice heterozy-
gous for a single mutation; they survived an
average of 10 months and developed tumors
similar to those found in mice with either
single mutation (Fig. 3A). Southern blot anal-
ysis of tumor DNA (n 5 6) revealed LOH of
either the wild-type Nf1 locus or the wild-
type p53 locus (23). In contrast, mice carry-
ing Nf1 and p53 mutations in cis survived an
average of only 5 months and exhibited a
significant increase in the percentage of soft
tissue sarcomas compared with mice of other
genotypes (Nf11/2, 5%; p53, 57%; NP trans,
36%; NP cis, 81%). Furthermore, although
NP trans animals exclusively develop osteo-,
fibro-, rhabdomyo-, and hemangiosarcomas,
about 30% of tumors from the NP cis animals
stained positively for S100 and exhibited
classic histological features of MPNSTs (n 5
28) (Fig. 3B). The percentage of MPNSTs
identified by these criteria is likely to be an
underestimate because only 50% of human
MPNSTs are S100-positive and due to the
characteristic heterogeneity of
this tumor
type (15, 24). Importantly, loss of both wild-
type alleles in tumors from the NP cis mice
was consistently observed (n 5 12) (23),
which suggests that the loss of both genes
cooperates in formation of these lesions in
mice and supports a causal role for p53 mu-
tations in development of MPNSTs in NF1
patients. The presence of S100-positive cells
in the tumors from the NP cis mice contrasts
with the analysis of neurofibromas in the
model described above, where the lesions
were universally S1002. Although this pat-
tern was unexpected, it supports the hypoth-
esis that the timing of Nf1 deficiency may be
critical for expression of the S100 marker.
Specifically, in contrast to the neurofibroma
model, in the MPNSTs Nf12/2 cells arise
from Nf11/2 cells, most likely at a later stage
of gestation or in the adult mouse.

In summary, our data on the Nf12/2:
Nf11/1 chimeras indicate that complete loss
of Nf1 is an obligate step in neurofibroma
development and suggest that the prevalence
of neurofibromin-deficient cells in the devel-
oping nerve is the rate-limiting factor in for-
mation of this tumor in the mouse. It remains
unclear why fewer of these cells arise in
Nf11/2 mice than in human NF1 patients.
Possible explanations include interspecies
differences in lifespan, target cell number, or
proliferative properties or interspecies differ-
ences in the mutability of the NF1 locus. We
have also demonstrated that mutations in Nf1
and p53 cooperate in the development of
MPNSTs, which supports a causal role for
p53 mutations in their formation. The devel-
opment of these lesions might call into ques-

be overcome by inhibition of p53 function
(25); oncogenic ras alleles can also induce
p53-dependent growth arrest or apoptosis in
human and mouse fibroblasts (26).

The

simultaneous

homozygosing

of
linked mutations by the process described
here as co-LOH could have more general
importance in tumor development, which
could be strongly influenced either positively
or negatively by the arrangement of linked
germ line or somatically acquired mutations.

tion the conclusion that a low rate of Nf1
LOH limits the development of neurofibro-
mas in Nf11/2 mice (see above). We hypoth-
esize that the concomitant loss of p53 and Nf1
function that occurs
in development of
MPNSTs in the NP cis mice allows for the
outgrowth of cells that otherwise would have
undergone growth arrest or apoptosis were
Nf1 mutated alone. Previous work has shown
that dysregulation of the Ras pathway in rat
Schwann cells leads to growth arrest that can

This effect may be more pronounced in mice
than in humans, where LOH events are typ-
ically subchromosomal. Still, closely linked
mutations that act synergistically or antago-
nistically could strongly affect the process of
human tumor development
through this
mechanism.

Finally, we anticipate that both models
will be critical in further characterization of
tumorigenic mechanisms in NF1 and in the
evaluation of potential
therapies, such as
compounds designed to inhibit Ras signaling,
such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors (27).

Mouse Tumor Model for
Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis Type 1

Kristine S. Vogel,1*† Laura J. Klesse,1* Susana Velasco-Miguel,1*

Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder charac-
terized by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest
origin. Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1,
cooperate with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during
malignant transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and
p53 alleles in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7
months of age. These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci
and express phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and
human NF1 malignancies.

Mutations in tumor suppressor genes are com-
mon events in human cancers (1). Individuals
with a mutation in one copy of the NF1 gene
develop benign cutaneous neurofibromas, plex-
iform neurofibromas, cafe´-au-lait spots, and ax-
illary freckling (2). Through loss of heterozy-
gosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus, patients with
neurofibromatosis type 1 are at increased risk of
developing malignancies of neural crest deriv-
atives,
including malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs), malignant Triton tu-
mors (MTTs), and pheochromocytomas (2, 3).
MPNSTs and MTTs arise from plexiform neu-
rofibromas and frequently are associated with
mutation or loss of the p53 tumor suppressor
gene (2, 4). The protein product of the NF1
gene neurofibromin is a guanosine triphos-
phatase (GTPase)–activating protein (GAP)
that can negatively regulate p21ras signaling
(5). Mutations that activate Ras cooperate with
mutations that inactivate p53 in a number of

transformation assays and models of tumori-
genesis (6).

The Nf1 and p53 genes are linked in humans
and in mice (7). To determine whether null
mutations in Nf1 and p53 cooperate to acceler-
ate tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated a re-
combinant mouse strain harboring inactivated
Nf1 and p53 alleles linked on mouse chromo-
some 11. We accomplished this with inter-
crosses of trans-Nf11/2:p531/2 compound het-
erozygotes or through crosses with p531/2 het-
erozygotes. The integrity of the recombinant
cis-Nf1:p53 chromosome was established by
genomic Southern blot analysis and by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR). All progeny of
cis-Nf11/2:p531/2 test crosses to wild-type an-
imals were either compound heterozygotes or
entirely wild type, which confirms the integrity
of the double-mutant chromosome.

Mice that are heterozygous for the Nf1 mu-
tation alone are at increased risk of developing
pheochromocytomas and myeloid leukemias
between 18 and 28 months of age (8). Loss of
one or both copies of the p53 gene leads to
accelerated tumorigenesis. Thus, p532/2 mice
develop lymphomas and hemangiosarcomas by
6 months of age, whereas p531/2 mice exhibit
a predominance of osteosarcomas that arise lat-
er, after 9 months (9). We compared the mor-
tality of trans- and cis-Nf11/2:p531/2 com-
pound heterozygotes with that of p531/2 and
