ABSTRACT: Wide-ranging exploration of analogues of an ATP-competitive pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor of Akt led to the
discovery of clinical candidate AZD5363, which showed increased potency, reduced hERG aﬃnity, and higher selectivity against
the closely related AGC kinase ROCK. This compound demonstrated good preclinical drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics
(DMPK) properties and, after oral dosing, showed pharmacodynamic knockdown of phosphorylation of Akt and downstream
biomarkers in vivo, and inhibition of tumor growth in a breast cancer xenograft model.

■ INTRODUCTION

Akt (also known as protein kinase B or PKB) is a serine
threonine kinase that acts as a key node in the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)−Akt signaling pathway. This axis is one of the
most
frequently deregulated signaling pathways in human
cancers and has been shown to mediate resistance to a range of
cytotoxic, antihormonal, and targeted therapies. The pathway
plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, motility, and
survival1 through modulation of a large number of downstream
substrates2 and is activated by several mechanisms in diﬀerent
cancer types, including somatic mutation, deletion, and ampliﬁ-
cation of genes encoding key components. Co-localization
of Akt with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
(PDK1) at the plasma membrane allows the phosphorylation
of threonine 308 (Thr308), located in the Akt activation loop.
This phosphorylation event is necessary and suﬃcient for Akt
activation.3 Further phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473
(Ser473),
located in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif by
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2,4
allows for maximal activation of Akt enzymes. There are three
mammalian isoforms of Akt (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) that are
broadly expressed in most normal tissues and are also expressed

in most tumor types to varying degrees. The three enzymes
have a similar organizational structure: an N-terminal pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain, a central serine/threonine catalytic
domain, and a short regulatory region at the C-terminus, also
called the hydrophobic motif.5 A unique feature of the Akt
isoforms is the C-terminal extension, which folds back over the
ATP site to position two aromatic residues into a hydrophobic
groove present in the N-lobe. This results in the occlusion of
the solvent channel present in the hinge region of most other
kinases.

Due to the strong rationale for targeting Akt in cancer,
much eﬀort has been made to identify Akt inhibitors with
acceptable pharmaceutical properties, particularly for oral
dosing. The most common approaches described to date have
been through the development of compounds that are either
ATP-competitive or that prevent the formation of the active
enzyme.6 Despite the signiﬁcant eﬀorts invested in the genera-
tion of inhibitors of components of this pathway, it remains
unclear whether ATP-competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Benzylamide 3 has previously been reported as an orally
bioavailable inhibitor of Akt. This compound was originally
identiﬁed as a suitable starting point for further optimization as
a result of our prior collaboration with Astex Therapeutics Ltd.
and their collaboration with the Institute of Cancer Research.10
This lead arose from a fragment-based screening campaign from
which several alternative hinge binding groups were found,
which were then elaborated into potent Akt inhibitors; a selec-
tion of the chemotypes explored are highlighted in Figure 2.11

Article

Common features of these inhibitors include a small hinge-
binding heteroaromatic ring presenting a donor−acceptor motif
to Glu228 and Ala230, a phenyl or piperidine spacing group,
a primary or secondary amino functionality that can form a
H-bonding interaction with the acid hole formed by Glu234 and
Glu278, and a lipophilic aromatic group that is positioned in a
hydrophobic pocket under the P-loop of the ATP-binding
site. This pharmacophore for ATP-competitive inhibition of
Akt matches has subsequently been reported by a number of
other groups.12 Following thorough evaluation of the various
lead series, we elected to work on the benzylamide series as
exempliﬁed by compound 3, as its eﬃcacy and tolerability were
favorable. Key data for 3 are listed in Table 1. Compound 3 is a

pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt pathway signaling and
demonstrated growth inhibition in a relevant xenograft model.10
However, enzyme selectivity over closely related ROCK2 was
judged to be insuﬃcient at just 5-fold based on enzyme activity.
ROCK2 is another member of the AGC kinases and is involved
in regulation of vascular tone and thus control of blood pressure.
There is high homology within the AGC kinase family, with
Akt1 and ROCK2 sharing 40% sequence identify (53%
similarity) in the kinase domain; this increases to 86% sequence
identity (100% similarity) when the 15 residues within 3 Å of
ATP are considered. A selective ROCK inhibitor has been
shown to signiﬁcantly decrease blood pressure and cause
increased heart rate and cardiac contractility in a canine in vivo
cardiovascular model.13 Our extensive structure−activity relation-
ship (SAR) studies exploring the series had revealed that
achieving selectivity over ROCK while retaining Akt potency
was challenging. At the same time, we aspired to resolve the
issue of activity at the hERG ion channel, given that compound
3, with an IC50 of 5 μM for inhibition, may present issues further
in development. Activity against
is
implicated in the development of Torsades de Pointes and
sudden cardiac death. Despite these issues, 3 demonstrated good
pharmacokinetics across three species, showing reasonable
absorption and low to moderate clearance. In vitro hepatic
clearance values were also low, including importantly in human
cells. It is noteworthy that this good drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetics (DMPK) proﬁle is observed in the presence of
the required primary amino pharmacophore. We speculate that
the combination of close proximity to the electron-withdrawing
amido group, coupled with high steric hindrance at this tertiary
center, mitigates against the clearance and absorption issues one
might otherwise anticipate.

the hERG ion channel

Chemistry. Inhibitors of Akt described in this work were
generally assembled in a short sequence from readily available

starting materials (Scheme 1). Piperidine 5 and chlorohetero-
cycle 4 were condensed to give the key carboxylic acid building
block 6, which was subsequently coupled with a variety of
primary amines to give the requisite amide group. Acid-promoted
deprotection of the primary amine functionality revealed Akt
inhibitors 7. The amines used in this coupling were often
commercially available; however, representative examples of
the synthesis of more complex coupling partners is outlined in
Schemes 2 and 3.

Amino acid 8 was reduced to amino alcohol 9, which was
coupled to building block 6 to give, after deprotection, inhibitor
61. Amino alcohol 9 also served as a useful precursor to bis-
amine 13 and ether 14, used in the synthesis of Akt inhibitors
45 and 63, respectively. The alcohol was converted to mesylate
11, which in turn gave bis-amine 13 by displacement with
dimethylamine and subsequent deprotection of the benzyl-
amine moiety. Alternatively, simple alkylation of 10 with
methyl iodide gave ether 15 after removal of the protecting
group. Similarly, amino acid 16 was used as a starting material
for a range of diﬀerently substituted benzylamines. Reduction
of the acid and in situ protection of the amino group gave
alcohol 17, with subsequent mesylate ester 18 proving a
versatile intermediate for introduction of a range of polar
substituents. Thioester formation and N-chlorosuccinimide-
promoted oxidation give sulfonyl chloride 20. Quenching with
ammonia and amine deprotection yielded β-aminosulfonamide
22, used in the synthesis of inhibitor 56. Primary amine 23 was
also synthesized from mesylate 18 through azide displacement
and reduction. This amine was capped with an acyl group to
give 25 or with a mesyl group to give 27, and these ultimately
yielded Akt inhibitors 55 and 58, respectively. Mesylate 18 was
also used to access higher alkyl homologues such as 31, used to
deliver inhibitor 59. Displacement with cyanide gave nitrile 28,
which was reduced to primary amine 29. As before, capping

herein can be found in the Supporting Information.

α-Substitution with Alkyl Groups. A crystal structure of
3 bound to Akt2 was available to AstraZeneca from our
collaboration10 (PDB code 2X39), which showed that the
pyrrolopyrimidine of 3 formed hydrogen bonds to the hinge
domain, the amino group interacted with an acidic hole, and
the p-chlorophenyl group entered a pocket under the P-loop.
SAR around this lead has been reported, although no further
improvements in potency were found in the analogues tested.10
Indeed, our own extensive medicinal chemistry exploration of
this lead also indicated many diﬀerent modiﬁcations ultimately
proved unproductive in achieving the desired combination of
properties, including changes to the hinge binding group, amide
functionality, and any changes to the nature and position of the
primary amine. We were intrigued, however, by the potential to
substitute on the α-carbon of the benzyl group, since inspection
of the available crystal structure suggested space to accom-
modate such a change. No obvious interactions would result
from this, however, so it was unclear what eﬀect this would
have on potency or other key properties. Initially the racemic
α-methylated compound 32 was synthesized, and despite
showing broadly similar enzyme potency to 3, a modest improve-
ment in cell activity was observed, in addition to slightly better
selectivity. To understand whether one isomer was more
responsible than the other for this proﬁle, both individual
enantiomers were synthesized. The S-enantiomer 34 proved
signiﬁcantly more active than the R-enantiomer 33, and despite
absolute ROCK activity also being greater in 33, the improve-
ments in Akt enzyme potency meant the selectivity ratio was
also improved (Table 2). No signiﬁcant movement in hERG
inhibition was observed for this small change, however. It was
hypothesized that the introduction of the α-methyl chiral center

introduced a ligand conformational preference with respect to
the P-loop aryl group and consequently that the selectivity
diﬀerences observed could potentially arise from diﬀerences in
the nature of the P-loop hydrophobic pocket between Akt1 and
ROCK2. If
this hypothesis was correct, diﬀerent selectivity
proﬁles might be achievable, enhancing Akt1 potency and
reducing ROCK2 potency through the development of ligands
that might exploit this proposed diﬀerence.

Additional α-alkyl analogues were synthesized to explore the
eﬀect of further substitution, and for synthetic convenience the
initial follow-up studies were performed with racemic samples.
Small lipophilic substituents such as ethyl 35 and cyclopropyl
36 showed similar potency to methyl, and hERG activity was
also unchanged, although ROCK selectivity was improved,
particularly for the latter (Table 2). Larger α-substituents were
generally less potent in both enzyme and cell assays. The
compound with an α-phenyl group, 37,
led to a signiﬁcant
reduction in cellular potency, as did other compounds with
large aromatic substituents such as the benzylic analogue 38
(Table 2). Alkyl substituents larger than methyl generally came
with an expected increase in lipophilicity and concomitant
reduction in solubility, and this issue was particularly acute for
α side chains that contained aromatic rings. For these larger
groups, hERG inhibition also appeared to increase in line with
log D.

Aromatic Ring Substitution. Previous studies had demon-
strated that while a range of other pendant phenyl substituents
could be tolerated,
in the limited compounds studied, a
p-chloro group oﬀered the best overall balance, particularly with
respect to potency.10 As methyl appeared to be the optimal
α-substituent in this initial limited expansion, this group was
ﬁxed and variation of the aromatic ring in the benzyl group
was revisited in an attempt to explore in particular the eﬀect on
hERG potency. Table 3 shows a selection of the aromatic

substitutions examined, all in a racemic α-methyl series to aid
synthetic tractability. Removal of the chloro group to give
unsubstituted compound 39 resulted in a reduction in potency,
at both the enzyme and cellular level, consistent with earlier
observations. Introduction of a p-ﬂuoro group as in compound
40 recovered some of this potency, but not to the level seen
with chloro analogue 32. In both these examples however,

absolute hERG aﬃnity was lowered, broadly consistent with
lowered lipophilicity, but this did not result in improvements to
solubility. Heterocycles in this region were also poorly tolerated,
with both 2- and 3-pyridyl analogues 41 and 42 showing no
cellular activity at the top concentration tested. Despite signiﬁ-
cant improvements in both hERG activity and solubility for this
change, selectivity at the enzyme level versus ROCK was also

severely compromised. A range of other simple substitutions
were explored as typiﬁed by sulfone 43 and dimethoxy analogue
44. The picture relative to chloro lead 32 was again consistent,
with compounds often showing improved hERG margin, but
generally weaker Akt cell activity and compromised selectivity
proﬁle.

α-Substitution Carrying a Basic Side Chain. Following
initial exploration of
the vector provided by the benzyl
methylene group that led to S-Me analogue 34, this region
was revisited with a broader range of functionalities. The impact
of appending basic groups in this region was explored with a
focused set of targets, since although the modest solubility of
lead 3 does not compromise its pharmacokinetic proﬁle, further
improvements might be beneﬁcial. Initial exploration targeted
a dimethylamino side chain as in homologues 45 and 46.
Both analogues showed potent enzyme and cellular inhibition,
with a three-carbon side chain seemingly oﬀering modest
advantage over a two-carbon side chain with respect to ROCK
selectivity. In both molecules hERG activity is dramatically
reduced. Further exploration of the SAR around the basic group
with analogues such as pyrrolidine (47), morpholine (48), and
piperidine (49) led to compounds with a very similar overall
proﬁle: improved potency and selectivity and lowered hERG

aﬃnity (Table 4). A number of chirally pure S-enantiomers
were also synthesized. Compound 50 is the S-enantiomer of
racemate 45, and in this case the proﬁle is largely identical with
50, showing potent cell activity, high solubility, and good hERG
margin, albeit with a lower selectivity over ROCK. Varying the
base further, such as with pyrrolidine 51 or piperidine 52, again
led to compounds with a good balance of properties but with
lower than ideal ROCK selectivity (Table 4). Single S-isomers
50−52 were all tested in a rat DMPK study and all showed
clearance at a rate signiﬁcantly in excess of liver blood ﬂow, and
consequently no oral bioavailability (Table 4). A contribution
to this from limited absorption cannot be ruled out, however.
α-Substitution Carrying a Neutral Side Chain. Since
side chains carrying a basic group had led to high clearance
and low oral bioavailability, the exploration of nonbasic polar
substituents was initiated. Amides 53 and 54 and reversed
amide 55 showed much reduced hERG activity, but cell potency
and overall ROCK selectivity was compromised (Table 5).
A similar proﬁle was observed with sulfonamides 56 and 57, one
of compromised cell activity and selectivity. Two-carbon side-
chain analogue 56 showed slightly greater activity than the three-
carbon analogue 57 but worse absolute selectivity, and solubility
was poor despite comparable log D to other examples (Table 5).

This pattern was reinforced when the sulfonamide was reversed,
as in 58 and 59, where again a two-carbon spacer in compound
59 gave better cell activity, and here improved selectivity, over
the shorter one-carbon linker in 58 (Table 5). Both compounds
had an acceptable hERG margin, but again, sulfonamides
consistently demonstrated only modest solubility. The impact
of spacing a hydroxyl substituent at varying distances from the
methylene group was explored with homologues 60−62. As
before, a clear preference for a two-carbon spacer emerged, with
61 showing the greatest cell potency, ROCK selectivity and
hERG margin (Table 5). One-carbon spacing as in 60 also had
much reduced hERG potency but with compromised cell

potency, and three-carbon spacing in 62, while more potent than
60, showed measurable hERG inhibition. Methylating 61 to give
ether 63 led to an increase in lipophilicity, much increased hERG
inhibition, and also compromised cellular potency. Finally, isola-
tion of the more active S-enantiomer of 61 gave 64, subsequently
designated AZD5363. This compound showed potent pan-Akt
enzyme inhibition (3−8 nM) and cell activity (89 nM), high
hERG margin (>100 000),h excellent solubility, and 18-fold
selectivity for Akt1 enzyme over ROCK2 (Table 5). The cor-
responding R-enantiomer was
synthesized and exhibited
markedly lower enzyme and cell potency of 90 nM and 3300 nM
respectively, conﬁrming a chiral preference for binding.

X-ray Crystallographic Studies. A crystal structure of 64
bound to Akt1 (PDB code 4GV1) was obtained (Figure 3).
This revealed key interactions and features that may contribute
to the high Akt aﬃnity of this compound. The protein is in
the active form with the C-terminal tail
folding back over
the N-terminal
lobe to position Phe469 and Phe472 in the
hydrophobic pocket essential for regulatory control of Akt1.
The pyrrolopyrimidine ring forms two hydrogen bonds to the
kinase hinge through residues Ala230 and Glu228. Interest-
ingly, the central piperidine ring adopts an axial conformation
with respect to both the pyrrolopyrimidine hinge group and
the P-loop aryl group. This axial over equatorial preference is
inﬂuenced by the ortho-sp2 nitrogen in the pyrrolopyrimidine
core, and adoption of this conformation positions the basic
amino group in the acidic hole formed by Glu234 and Glu278,
and the p-chlorophenyl group in a hydrophobic pocket under
the P-loop formed by the side chains of Lys179, Leu181, and
Val164 and backbone atoms of Lys158 and Gly162. The
conformation of the central piperidine observed in the Akt1
crystal structure is consistent with the conformation observed
previously for the initial lead 3.10a Although the axial positioning
of the substituents is likely to be energetically less favorable than
the corresponding equatorially substituted analogue,
this
conformation is believed to be adopted to position the central
ring substituents optimally with respect to the Akt1 binding site.
It is also of note that the basic amino group forms a close
contact with the sulfur of Met28110 and hydrogen bonds with
the side chain of Glu234, the backbone carbonyl of Glu278, and
an associated water molecule. The pKa of the amino group of
64 was experimentally determined and was found to have a
relatively low value of 6.1. The amide NH does not form any
direct contacts with the protein, although it could form a water-
mediated interaction to Asp292 and Asn279. The hydroxyethyl
side chain also does not appear to form any direct interactions
with the protein but occupies a solvent-ﬁlled region and possibly
forms a water-mediated interaction to Glu278. This residue
Glu278 corresponds to Asp218 in ROCK2; consequently the
presence of the hydoxyethyl group may result in a diﬀerent
interaction proﬁle between the two proteins in this region.
However, from the available information it is not possible to

potency and selectivity of this compound.

Pharmacokinetic Proﬁling. The DMPK proﬁle of 64 is
highlighted in Table 6. Protein binding remained low across all
species, consistent with initial lead 3. Compound 64 is extensively
distributed outside of blood, with volumes of distribution ranging

from 2 to 4 L/kg in preclinical species. Oral bioavailability in
mouse remains high despite higher clearance, which may indicate
a saturation of ﬁrst-pass metabolism with the oral dose or extra-
hepatic metabolism. The proﬁle in rat
is somewhat worse,
however: whole blood clearance is relatively high, and con-
sequently bioavailability remains a modest 13%. Optimization of
the critical parameters of cell potency, ROCK selectivity, and
absolute hERG margin of 3 has been achieved, but here at the
expense of some of the favorable pharmacokinetic properties
the early lead demonstrated. The proﬁle in dog appears more
balanced, with moderate clearance and moderate bioavailability.
As with the initial lead, in vitro intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint)
measured in hepatocytes is generally low, with turnover in human
cells only measurable by an assay with a 2 h incubation.

Biological Activity. In order to understand the compoundʼs
selectivity proﬁle, 64 was assayed against a larger enzyme panel
of 75 kinases, of which 35 were also AGC family kinases.
Signiﬁcant activity, deﬁned herein as >75% inhibition at a ﬁxed
concentration of 1 μM, was seen for just 15 kinases, of which
14 were unsurprisingly from the AGC family. In addition to
Akt1−3, these were ROCK2, MKK1, MSK1, MSK2, PKCγ,
PKGα, PKGβ, PRKX, RSK2, RSK3, P70S6K, and PKA.
Only the latter two kinases, P70S6K and PKA, were inhibited
with enzyme IC50 values comparable to Akt1−3 inhibition, at
6 and 7 nM, respectively. However, in cellular end points of
these two kinases, activity was relatively reduced compared to the
primary Akt pharmacology. The cellular IC50 against P70S6K
was approximately 5 μM, as measured by inhibition of S6 phos-
phorylation in TSC1 null RT4 bladder cancer cells, while activity
against PKA was around 1 μM, as determined by inhibition of
VASP phosphorylation in A431 cells. Activity against related
ROCK1 isoform was much reduced relative to ROCK2, with
an IC50 of 470 nM. Compound 64 was also very eﬀective at
inhibiting the phosphorylation of downstream Akt substrates in a

variety of cell lines (Table 7). Potent inhibition was seen against
pGSK3β and pPRAS40 as direct markers of Akt cell activity. The

growth inhibitory eﬀect of 64 was also examined across a much
larger in-house cellular panel of 182 tumor cell lines in standard
proliferation assay format. Sensitive cell lines were deﬁned as
those inhibited with an IC50 of 3 μM or less. A majority of breast
cell lines proved to be sensitive (64%), with gastric, endometrial,
prostate, and hematologic lines showing intermediate sensitivity
(24−33% responsive). Lines that showed a poor response to 64
were derived from lung (12% sensitive), colorectal (7%), and
bladder (0%) cells. The degree of sensitivity of a line could be
correlated with a variety of oncogenic markers. Speciﬁcally,
activating mutations in PIK3CA, loss or inactivation of tumor
suppressor PTEN, or HER2 ampliﬁcation all were signiﬁcantly
predictive of responsiveness to therapy. Additionally, correlation
was also seen between the RAS mutation status of cell lines and
resistance to 64.14

The eﬀect of 64 in vivo was characterized ﬁrst by measuring
pharmacodynamic activity in a BT474c breast adenocarcinoma
xenograft model. Following single oral doses of 100 and
300 mg/kg, 64 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt
downstream substrates pGSK3β and pPRAS40 as well as pS6
in a manner that was directly linked to plasma exposure
(Figure 4). Potent inhibition of pPRAS40 and pGSK3β was

distal cellular marker pS6 showed a similar exposure response

growth of continuous oral dosing of 64 was also assessed in the
same model over 14 days. When dosed at 200 mg/kg once per
day, 64 was less eﬀective than dosing at 100 mg/kg twice per
day (39% inhibition versus 80%). Greatest inhibition of growth
was observed with a dose of 200 mg/kg twice per day, which
led to 104% inhibition, and this proved to be the maximum
well-tolerated continuous twice-daily dose (Figure 5).

Conclusions. Compound 3 served as a lead Akt inhibitor
with an acceptable DMPK proﬁle in preclinical species and
in vivo antitumor eﬃcacy with modulation of biomarkers
following oral dosing. Nevertheless, it had an unfavorably low
ROCK selectivity, only modest cell activity, and unwanted
activity at the hERG ion channel. A crystal structure of this
compound bound to Akt1 suggested a possible vector for
further substitution, and this position was ultimately explored
with a range of diverse substituents and chain lengths, leading
ultimately to compound 64, AZD5363. This agent inhibits all
Akt isoforms with a potency of <10 nM in vitro and is a potent
inhibitor of phosphorylation of the Akt substrates GSK3β,
PRAS40, and S6 in a range of cell lines. It has good selectivity
over both the hERG ion channel and closely related AGC
kinase ROCK, and it shows pharmacodynamic and xenograft
activity in vivo. It has potential
in cancer therapy and is
currently in phase 1 clinical trials.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Chemistry. All reactions were performed under inert conditions
(nitrogen) unless otherwise stated. Temperatures are given in degrees
Celsius (°C); operations were carried out at room or ambient tem-
perature, that is, at a temperature in the range of 18−25 °C. All solvents
and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used
without further puriﬁcation. For coupling reactions, all solvents were
dried and degassed prior to reaction. Reactions performed under
microwave irradiation utilized either a Biotage Initiator or CEM
Discover microwave. Upon workup, organic solvents were typically
dried prior to concentration with anhydrous MgSO4 or Na2SO4. Flash
silica chromatography was typically performed on an Isco Companion,
using Silicycle silica gel, 230−400 mesh 40−63 μm cartridges, Grace
Resolv silica cartridges, or Isolute Flash Si or Si II cartridges. Reverse-
phase chromatography was performed on a Waters XBridge Prep C18

4-[(2-methylpropan-2-yl)oxycarbonylamino]piperidine-4-carboxylic
acid 5 (115.6 g, 473 mmol) in acetonitrile (1.5 L) and water (4.5 L)
was added sodium bicarbonate (181 g, 2.2 mol), followed by 4-chloro-
7H-pyrrole[2,3-d]pyrimidine 4 (72.7 g, 473 mmol). The mixture was
heated at reﬂux under nitrogen for 24 h and then extracted with ethyl
acetate (4 × 1 L). The aqueous layer was concentrated and methanol
(1.5 L) was added. The mixture was shaken for 30 min at 45 °C and
ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated again and dissolved in water
(300 mL). HCl (6 N) was added until the pH reached 4.5 (ca. 80 mL).
The mixture was ﬁltered and the solid was dried under vacuum to
aﬀord the crude product, which was further puriﬁed by silica gel
chromatography [elution with methanol/dichloromethane (DCM)

and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (163 mg, 1.1 mmol) were stirred together
in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 2 mL) under nitrogen for 16 h. The
reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate (20 mL) and
brine (4 × 20 mL). The organics were combined, dried, and evaporated
in vacuo. The resultant white solid was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL),
and a 4 M solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL) was added. The
resulting mixture was stirred for 16 h and then diluted with diethyl
ether (50 mL). The crude product was isolated by ﬁltration as the HCl
salt, which was puriﬁed by ion-exchange chromatography on an SCX
column. The desired product was eluted from the column with 7 M
ammonia/methanol, and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness.
This material was puriﬁed by preparative LC-MS. Fractions containing

Amine 27 used above was synthesized as described below:

tert-Butyl 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethylcarbamate (17).
2-Amino-2-(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid (12 g, 64.65 mmol) was stirred
in THF (200 mL), and sodium borohydride (5.82 g, 153.87 mmol)
was added in portions to the stirred mixture under nitrogen. A solution
of iodine (16.41 g, 64.65 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added dropwise
while the temperature was maintained below 15 °C by use of an ice
bath. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and
stirred at reﬂux overnight. The reaction was quenched by the addition
of methanol (40 mL) and then treated with triethylamine (18.02 mL,
129 mmol) and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (14.11 g, 65 mmol). The
mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature before being
partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was
dried and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
puriﬁed by ﬂash silica chromatography with gradient elution (10−50%
ethyl acetate/DCM) to aﬀord 17 as a colorless solid (10.32 g, 59%).

sulfonate (18). Methanesulfonyl chloride (1.45 mL, 19 mmol) was
added to 17 (4.63 g, 17 mmol) and DIPEA (6.23 mL, 35.78 mmol) in
DCM (40 mL) cooled to 0 °C over a period of 5 min under nitrogen.
The resulting solution was stirred at 20 °C for 2 h. The reaction
mixture was diluted with DCM (100 mL) and washed sequentially
with water (100 mL). The organic layer was dried and evaporated to
aﬀord crude product, which was puriﬁed by ﬂash silica chromatog-
raphy, elution gradient 0−10% ethyl acetate in DCM. Pure fractions
were evaporated to dryness to aﬀord 18 as a white solid (3.12 g, 52%).

at 80 °C for 1 h. The mixture was cooled and allowed to stir at room
temperature overnight. The solution was partitioned between ethyl
acetate and water. The organic layer was washed twice with water and
then dried and concentrated until the ﬁnal volume was approximately
5 mL. Ethanol (20 mL) and 10% palladium on carbon (75 mg,
0.07 mmol) were added. The resulting suspension was stirred under an
atmosphere of hydrogen at ambient pressure and temperature for 1 h.

1.63 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was treated with methanesulfonyl chloride
(0.075 mL, 0.98 mmol). The resulting solution was stirred at ambient
temperature for 2 h. The mixture was partitioned between DCM and
sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic layer was concentrated and
the residue was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography on silica with
gradient elution (10−30% ethyl acetate/DCM) to aﬀord 26 as a
colorless solid (154 mg, 54%). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.43 (9H, s), 2.92

concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was puriﬁed
by ion-exchange chromatography on an SCX column. The residue was
loaded onto the column in methanol and washed with methanol. The
desired product was eluted from the column with 2 M ammonia in

methanol, and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to aﬀord 27
