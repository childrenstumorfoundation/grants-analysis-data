Abstract

Purpose: The hallmark of neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the onset of dermal or plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, mainly composed of Schwann cells. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas can transform into malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) that are resistant to therapies.

Experimental Design: The aim of this study was to identify an additional pathway in the NF1
tumorigenesis. We focused our work on Wnt signaling that is highly implicated in cancer, mainly in
regulating the proliferation of cancer stem cells. We quantiﬁed mRNAs of 89 Wnt pathway genes in 57 NF1-
associated tumors including dermal and plexiform neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs. Expression of two major
stem cell marker genes and ﬁve major epithelial–mesenchymal transition marker genes was also assessed.
The expression of signiﬁcantly deregulated Wnt genes was then studied in normal human Schwann cells,
ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, and mast cells and in seven MPNST cell lines.

Results: The expression of nine Wnt genes was signiﬁcantly deregulated in plexiform neuroﬁbromas in
comparison with dermal neuroﬁbromas. Twenty Wnt genes showed altered expression in MPNST biopsies
and cell lines. Immunohistochemical studies conﬁrmed the Wnt pathway activation in NF1-associated
MPNSTs. We then conﬁrmed that the knockdown of NF1 in Schwann cells but not in epithelial cells
provoked the activation of Wnt pathway by functional transfection assays. Furthermore, we showed that the
protein expression of active b-catenin was increased in NF1-silenced cell lines. Wnt pathway activation was
strongly associated to both cancer stem cell reservoir and Schwann–mesenchymal transition.

Conclusion: We highlighted the implication of Wnt pathway in NF1-associated tumorigenesis. Clin

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dom-
inant neurocutaneous disorder affecting 1 in 3,000
individuals worldwide (1). The NF1 gene is located in the
chromosome region 17q11.2. Its protein product, neuroﬁ-
bromin, functions as a negative regulator of RAS proteins.

The main clinical features of NF1 are cafe-au-lait macules,
skinfold freckling, iris Lisch nodules, as well as skeletal
and cardiovascular abnormalities. NF1 patients have an
increased risk of both benign and malignant tumors, there-
fore, NF1 is classiﬁed as a tumor predisposition syndrome.
The most common tumors are benign peripheral nerve

Translational Relevance

The commonest neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1)-
associated tumors are nerve sheath tumors (NSTs: der-
mal or plexiform neuroﬁbromas), mainly composed of
Schwann cells. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas can undergo
malignant transformation to malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors with a poor vital prognosis. Little is
known of the genetic events required for neuroﬁbromas
formation or transformation. Here, we found that the
Wnt pathway was signiﬁcantly activated by quantifying
mRNAs of 89 Wnt pathway genes in 57 NF1-associated
NSTs. We then conﬁrmed that the knockdown of NF1 in
Schwann cells provoked the activation of Wnt pathway
by functional transfection assays. We showed that active
b-catenin protein expression was increased in NF1-
silenced cell lines. Wnt pathway activation was strongly
associated to both putative cancer stem cell reservoir and
Schwann–mesenchymal transition. We highlighted the
implication of Wnt pathway in NF1 peripheral nerve
sheath tumorigenesis. Elucidation of the role of cellular
signaling pathways tumorigenesis will enable to estab-
lish molecular targeted therapeutics in NF1.

sheath tumors (neuroﬁbromas), which vary greatly in both
number and size, and may be dermal or plexiform (2).

Dermal neuroﬁbromas are typically small and grow as
discrete lesions in the dermis whereas plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas can develop internally along the plexus of major
peripheral nerves and become quite large. Plexiform neu-
roﬁbromas are probably derived from embryonic Schwann
cell lineage (3). During development, neural-crest cells
migrate along the peripheral nerves, and a subset of cells
commit to the Schwann cell lineage. Zheng and colleagues
demonstrated that plexiform neuroﬁbromas could origi-
nate from Nf1 deﬁciency in fetal nonmyelinating Schwann
cells (4). Le and colleagues identiﬁed a population of
progenitor cells residing in the dermis, termed "skin-derived
precursors" that form dermal neuroﬁbromas through loss
of Nf1 (5). These differences between dermal and plexiform
neuroﬁbromas suggest that the type of progenitor but also
the timing of somatic NF1 mutations may determine the
clinical course of these tumors (6).

In contrast to dermal neuroﬁbromas, plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas can undergo malignant transformation to malig-
nant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) in about
10% of NF1 patients (7). Roughly half of all MPNSTs are
sporadic; they are found in patients who do not carry any
known genetic predisposition for cancer. The remaining
MPNSTs are found in patients who are diagnosed with NF1.
MPNSTs are resistant to conventional therapies, and their
deep-seated position and locally invasive growth hinder
complete surgical resection. The 5-year survival rate among
patients with MPNSTs ranges from 30% to 50%. In parallel
to the double inactivation of the NF1 gene, additional
genetic lesions seem necessary for malignant progression

Wnt Pathway Activation in NF1 Tumorigenesis

of plexiform neuroﬁbromas. TP53 mutations have been
identiﬁed in MPNSTs but not in benign neuroﬁbromas,
indicating that the p53-mediated pathway is involved in
malignant progression (6, 8). Alterations of other genes
(p16/CDKN2A, p14/ARF, p27/KIP1, EGFR, mTOR) were also
detected in MPNST (9–12).

Although we have now identiﬁed some of the genes that
when mutated initiate tumor formation and drive progres-
sion, the identity of the cell population(s) susceptible to
such transforming events remains undeﬁned in the majority
of human cancers. Recent studies indicate that a small
population of cells (called cancer stem cells) endowed with
unique self-renewal properties and tumorigenic potential is
present in some, and perhaps, all tumors (13, 14). Many
signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of normal
stem cells are found to be altered in several human cancers
(i.e., Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch pathways). Moreover,
several authors addressed the possible association between
the formation of stem cells and the epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Regulation of the EMT is a crucial step in
cancer development (15). Genetic alterations that impair
the differentiation program could endow such dedifferen-
tiated cells with attributes that mimic stem cell behavior.
In NF1 tumorigenesis, the question whether these tumors
arise from neural crest stem cells or differentiates glia
remains very controversial (4, 5, 16, 17). In this regard, we
have previously shown a dedifferentiation of Schwann cells,
as well as an activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway,
during malignant transformation of plexiform neuroﬁbro-
mas (18). TWIST1, an important
transcription factor
involved in embryonic development and in EMT, was
shown to be upregulated in NF1-associated MPNST (19).
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest a genetic-driven
Schwann–mesenchyme transition (SMT) that could gener-
ate cancer stem cells during NF1 tumorigenesis.

Wnt pathway is a major developmental pathway involved
in maintenance of normal stem cells (20), and altered in
several human cancers (21). Wnt signaling is a complex
process that requires interplay of many different proteins. In
addition to a large cohort of Wnt ligands, and frizzled
receptors, some Wnt pathways also require the presence of
coreceptors. Wnt ligands may activate 3 different pathways
(Supplementary Fig. S1): (i) the canonical pathway: involv-
ing b-catenin and LEF/TCF transcription factor; (ii) the
planar cell polarity pathway; and (iii) the Wnt/calcium
pathway (20, 22). All 3 pathways have different conse-
quences and drive speciﬁc processes for the cells in which
they signal.

Little is known of the additional cooperating genetic
events potentially required for full plexiform neuroﬁbroma
formation. Furthermore, the respective tumorigenic mecha-
nisms of dermal neuroﬁbromas and plexiform neuroﬁbro-
mas have rarely been compared (6). In this manuscript we
addressed the potential role of Wnt signaling in NF1 tumor-
igenesis. We here quantiﬁed the gene expression proﬁles of
89 actors of Wnt pathway in NF1-associated tumors.
We identiﬁed speciﬁc genes involved in Wnt signaling
pathway whose expressions signiﬁcantly differed between

3 NF1-associated tumor types: dermal and plexiform neu-
roﬁbromas and MPNSTs. We functionally conﬁrmed the
crosslink between NF1 alteration and Wnt pathway activa-
tion, using siRNA strategy in a cell line model. Finally, we
investigated the link between Wnt signaling pathway acti-
vation and the altered expression of stemness and SMT
genes.

Materials and Methods
Patients and samples

NF1-related samples were obtained by laser excision
(dermal neuroﬁbromas) or surgical excision (plexiform
neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs) from patients with NF1 at
Henri Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France). Sample handling
and processing was identical for all NF1-related tumors.
After clinical examination, the surgical removal of dermal
neuroﬁbromas was proposed in case of esthetical burden.
Resection or removal of plexiform neuroﬁbromas was pro-
posed for repair or in case of symptoms, pain or compres-
sion. The plexiform neuroﬁbromas (deep lesions involving
a plexus of nerves) were large, had a nodular aspect, and
severely deformed the affected tissues. They were all S100-
positive by immunostaining. Four patients with plexiform
neuroﬁbromas had developed MPNSTs. The main clinical
and histological characteristics of the 16 patients with
MPNSTs (validation set) are shown in Supplementary Table
S1. Immediately after surgery the tumor samples were ﬂash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80

C until RNA
extraction. NF1-related MPNSTs all arose from plexiform
neuroﬁbromas and showed very weak S100 immunostain-
ing (data not shown). MPNST samples from non-NF1
patients were obtained by surgical excision at Cochin Hos-
pital (Paris, France). Dermal neuroﬁbromas were used as
"normal" control samples as they never undergo malignant
transformation in MPNSTs. Indeed, neuroﬁbromas are
heterogeneous benign tumors composed of Schwann cells,
ﬁbroblasts, mast cells, and other cells, and have no "nor-
mal" tissue equivalent. Gene expression levels determined
by real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis in
plexiform neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs were thus expressed
relative to expression levels in dermal neuroﬁbromas.

Cell lines

We analyzed 7 human MPNST cell lines, namely NMS-2,
NMS-2PC, 88-3, ST88-14, 90-8, S462, and T265. NMS-2
and NMS-2PC were kind gifts from Dr. Akira Ogose (Niigata
University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan). 88-3, ST88-
14, and 90-8 were kind gifts from Dr. Nancy Ratner (Cin-
cinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati,
OH). S462 was a kind gift from Dr. Lan Kluwe (University
Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). T265 was a kind
gift from Dr. G De Vries (Loyola University, Chicago, IL).
MPNST cell lines were grown in RPMI medium supplemen-
ted with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 IU/mL penicillin,
and 10 mg/mL streptomycin. Normal Schwann cells and
ﬁbroblasts were obtained by primary cell culture and dif-
ferential isolation from normal sciatic nerve biopsies and

skin, respectively, and using cell culture and isolation con-
ditions as previously described (23–25). Normal mast cells
were obtained by means of cell culture and various speciﬁc
puriﬁcation steps from cord blood-derived human cells, as
previously described (26).

We functionally analyzed the crosslink between NF1
alteration and the Wnt pathway using siRNA strategy in
the mouse Schwann cell line MSC80. MSC80 cells exhibit
normal Schwann cell characteristics (S100, myelin pro-
tein zero, peripheral myelin protein 22 expression) and
have retained the capacity to myelinate axons (27). The
mouse Schwann cell
line MSC80 was maintained in
Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) supple-
mented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum
(Hyclone-Perbio), 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin
(Gibco), and 1% glutamine. Culture cells were grown at
37
C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2. A siRNA
strategy was also used in 2 human non-Schwann cell
lines: the breast cancer cell line, namely MCF-7 (Michigan
Cancer Foundation-7), and one embryonic kidney cell
line, namely HEK293 (Dr. Fran¸cois Lallemand, Institut
Curie, Saint-Cloud, France). We also analyzed mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type mice
and from Nf1
mice (Dr. Thomas De Readt, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, MA).

Human mRNAs quantiﬁcation by real-time RT-PCR:
studied panels

We ﬁrst quantiﬁed the mRNA expression level of the 89
Wnt pathway human genes in a series of 7 dermal neuroﬁ-
bromas, 7 plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and 8 MPNSTs (screen-
ing set; N ¼ 22 tumors). The 89 Wnt pathway quantiﬁed
genes encode 19 Wnt ligands, 13 Wnt receptors, 32 proteins
involved in canonical Wnt signal transduction, 4 Wnt tran-
scription factors, 10 LEF/TCF–inducible proteins (http://
www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targets.html), and 11
proteins involved in noncanonical Wnt signal pathways
including 4 proteins involved in the planar cell polarity
pathway and 7 proteins in the Wnt/calcium pathway (Sup-
plementary Table S2). The mRNA expression of the 32
markedly differentially expressed genes was then determined
in a larger tumor series including 10 dermal neuroﬁbromas,
31 plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and 16 MPNSTs (validation set:
57 tumors). Expression of 2 major stem cell marker genes
(PROM1 and NKX2.2) and 5 major EMT marker genes
(TWIST1, SLUG, VIM, SNAIL, and CDH1) was also assessed
in the validation set (N ¼ 57 tumors).

We then selected for further study the 24 genes whose
expression in the MPNST group and/or in the plexiform
neuroﬁbroma group markedly differenced (>2-fold) from
that in the dermal neuroﬁbroma group. Expression of the 24
genes was studied in normal human Schwann cells, ﬁbro-
blasts, endothelial cells, and mast cells, in 7 NF1-related
MPNST cell lines, in 4 sporadic MPNSTs, and in Nf1
and
Nf1
MEFs. Expression of the 24 genes was also studied in
the 2 human non-Schwann cell lines (HEK293 and MCF-7)
and one mouse Schwann cell line (MSC80) with siRNAs-
mediated NF1 knockdown.

mRNAs quantiﬁcation by real-time RT-PCR: method

We ﬁrst used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify
the mRNA expression of 89 selected Wnt pathway asso-
ciated-genes in a series of MPNSTs and plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas, by comparison with dermal neuroﬁbromas.
Quantitative RT-PCR is a major alternative to microarrays
for molecular tumor proﬁling, being far more precise,
reproducible, and quantitative (28). Furthermore, it is
more appropriate for analyzing weakly expressed genes
such as the Wnt genes in this study. Finally, RT-PCR
requires smaller amounts of total RNA (about 2 ng per
target gene), which is more adapted for analyzing small-
sized tumors.

The theoretical and practical aspects of real-time quanti-
tative RT-PCR using the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection
System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) have been
described in detail elsewhere (28). We quantiﬁed transcripts
of 2 endogenous RNA control genes involved in 2 cellular
metabolic pathways, namely TBP, which encodes the TATA
box-binding protein (a component of the DNA-binding
protein complex TFIID) and RPLP0 (also known as 36B4),
which encodes acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0. TBP
and RPLP0 were selected as endogenous controls because
the levels of their transcripts in the tumor samples were
low (Ct values between 24 and 26) and high (Ct values
between 18 and 20), respectively. Each sample was nor-
malized on the basis of its TBP (or RPLPO) content. Results,
expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression
relative to the TBP (or RPLPO) gene, and termed "Ntarget,"
were determined as Ntarget ¼ 2DCtsample , where the DCt value
of the sample was determined by subtracting the average Ct
value of the target gene from the average Ct value of the TBP
(or RPLP0) gene (29). The Ntarget values of the tumor
samples were subsequently normalized such that
the
mean of the dermal neuroﬁbroma Ntarget values was 1.
Primers for TBP, RPLP0, and the target genes were chosen
with the assistance of the computer programs Oligo 6.0
(National Biosciences). For each primer pair, we performed
no-template control (NTC) and no-reverse-transcriptase
control (RT-negative) assays, which produced negligible
signals
suggesting that
primer–dimer formation and genomic DNA contamination
effects were negligible. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis,
and PCR reaction conditions have been described
elsewhere (29).

(usually >40 in Ct values),

Immunohistochemical study

Formalin ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded skin samples were
retrieved from the archive material of the department of
Pathology of Henri Mondor Hospital. Hematoxylin–eosin–
saffron (HES) staining and immunohistochemistry were
applied to 3-mm-thick dewaxed sections. Immunostaining
of b-catenin (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) was done using
the Bond max device (Menarini diagnostics, France), at a
1:4,000 dilution after antigen retrieval by heat at pH 9. In all
samples, we checked the staining of epithelial (epidermis
or adnexae) and/or endothelial cells as internal positive
controls.

Wnt Pathway Activation in NF1 Tumorigenesis

HEK293, MCF-7, and MSC80 cells transfection with
siRNA

To knockdown the NF1 gene, human cell lines (HEK293
and MCF-7) and mouse cells (MSC80) transient transfec-
tions were carried out using Effecten reagent (Qiagen) for
MSC80, and Hiperfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)
according to HiPerFect Transfection Reagent Handbook for
human cell lines. SiRNAs were purchased from Qiagen:
mouse siRNA against Nf1 (reference GS18015), human
siRNA against NF1 (reference GS4763), and nontargeted
(NT) siRNAs (negative control reference 1027310). Mouse
Nf1 and human NF1 genes were targeted with 4 different
sequences of siRNA directed against 4 different regions of
the cognate mRNA. We quantiﬁed gene expressions at both
mRNA (using real-time RT-PCR) and protein (using West-
ern blot) levels to assess the siRNAs efﬁcacy.

Luciferase reporter assay of b-catenin–mediated Wnt
signaling pathway activation

Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the Wnt
pathway signaling activity in Nf1 invalidated or in control
(nontargeting; NT) siRNAs MSC80 cells. SuperTOP-Flash-
Luc plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. R T Moon
(University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle,
WA). One day before transfection, MSC80 cells (1.5 
105 cells per well) were seeded into 6-well plate and incu-
bated in the DMEM culture medium containing 10%
decomplemented fetal calf serum. SuperTOP-Flash-Luc
plasmid (0.4 mg), the pCMV-b-galactosidase expression
vector (0.1 mg), and siRNAs (25 nmol/L) were mixed with
a solution containing Effecten reagents (0.85 mg/mL) in
DMEM. The mixture was then added to the cells and
incubated overnight. Sixteen hours after transfection, the
medium was replaced by DMEM culture medium contain-
ing 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum. Luciferase activ-
ity was determined using an enzymatic method described
by Massaad and colleagues (30). The b-galactosidase activ-
ity was used for the transfection efﬁciency normalization.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis



Cells transfected with NT siRNA or with siRNAs against
NF1 were homogenized in 100 mL ice-cold RIPA buffer [50
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% SDS,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
pH 8.0, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF;
Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mg/mL leupeptin, 50 mg/mL pepstatin A,
and 50 mg/mL aprotinin]. Protein concentration of the
clariﬁed homogenates (4
C, 15 minutes, 13,500 rev/min)
was determined on all samples using the Bradford protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Aliquots of 30 mg of total
protein extracts were used for each sample. Homogenate
proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel or on Pre-
cast XT 4% to 12% Bis-Tris Criterion Gel (Bio-Rad) for
neuroﬁbromin and blotted onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes. Nonspeciﬁc binding sites in the transblots

were blocked at 4
C overnight with 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA), 0.01% Tween 20 (Invitrogen), TBS, pH
7.4. Membranes were then incubated at room temperature

a mixture of 5% BSA blocking agent and TBS-Tween 0.1%:
active (dephospho) b-catenin (anti-ABC) clone 8E7 anti-
body (1:1,000), b-catenin antibody (1:1,000), neuroﬁbro-
min antibody (1:1,000), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (1:10,000). They were
then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour 30 minutes
with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in 5% BSA
blocking buffer/TBS-Tween 0.1% (anti-mouse and anti-
rabbit at 1:20,000), followed by ECL Plus Western blotting
detection (Amersham) before exposure to radiographic ﬁlm
Hyperﬁlm ECL (Amersham). Western blots were quantiﬁed
by means of NIH Image J Software.

Primary antibodies against neuroﬁbromin (rabbit mono-
clonal antibody) were purchased from Santa-Cruz (refer-
ence sc67), mouse total b-catenin (mouse monoclonal
antibody) was purchased from BD Biosciences, human total
b-catenin (rabbit polyclonal antibody) was purchased from
Cell Signaling (reference #9562), active-b-catenin (mouse
monoclonal antibody) and GAPDH (mouse monoclonal
antibody) were purchased from Millipore (reference 05-665
and G8795). Secondary antibodies used for Western blot-
ting were horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-
mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Millipore).

Statistical analysis

As mRNA levels did not ﬁt a Gaussian distribution, (i)
mRNA levels in each subgroup of samples were expressed as
their median values and ranges, rather than their mean
values and coefﬁcients of variation; and (ii) comparison
and relationships between mRNA levels of the different
target genes were respectively estimated using nonparamet-
ric tests: the Mann–Whitney U test (link between 1 quali-
tative parameter and 1 quantitative parameter) and the
Spearman correlation test (link between 2 quantitative
parameters). Differences between the 2 populations were
judged signiﬁcant at conﬁdence levels greater than 95% (P <
0.05). In the SuperTOP-Flash Luciferase reporter assay, 2
groups comparisons were performed by the Student T test. A
P-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
mRNA expression of 89 Wnt pathway genes in 7 dermal
neuroﬁbromas, 7 plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and 8
MPNST NF1-related samples (screening set)

Eight (9%) of the 89 genes (i.e., WNT1, WNT7A, WNT8A,
WNT8B, WNT9B, DKK4, KREMEN2, and TLE1) showed
very low levels of target gene in dermal neuroﬁbromas,
plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and MPNSTs. Their mRNA levels
were only detectable but not reliably quantiﬁable by means
of real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays, mainly based on
ﬂuorescence SYBR Green methodology (Ct > 32). Thirty-
two (39.5%) of the 81 remaining genes were expressed at a
level (>2-fold) in the MPNST group and/or
different
the plexiform neuroﬁbromas group compared with the
dermal neuroﬁbromas group: 9 genes were deregulated in

the 7 plexiform neuroﬁbromas as compared with the 7
dermal neuroﬁbromas and 30 genes in the 8 MPNSTs as
compared with the 7 dermal neuroﬁbromas (Supplemen-
tary Table S3).

mRNA expression of 32 identiﬁed Wnt pathway genes
in 10 dermal neuroﬁbromas, 31 plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, and 16 MPNST NF1-related samples
(validation set)

Expression levels of the 32 deregulated genes identiﬁed by
"screening set" analysis were then determined in 10 dermal
neuroﬁbromas, 31 plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and 16
MPNST samples. Nine (28.1%) of the 32 genes were sig-
niﬁcantly deregulated in the 31 plexiform neuroﬁbromas
as compared with the 10 dermal neuroﬁbromas (P <
0.05; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4): 8 genes were
upregulated (WNT9A, FZD1, SFRP4, SFRP5, TLE2, MYC,
CAMK2B, and PRKCQ) and 1 was downregulated (SFRP1)
in plexiform neuroﬁbromas. These 9 deregulated genes in
plexiform neuroﬁbromas encode 1 Wnt ligand (WNT9A), 1
Wnt receptor (FZD1), 4 proteins involved in canonical Wnt
signal transduction (SFRP1, SFRP4, SFRP5, and TLE2), 1
LEF/TCF-inducible protein (MYC), and 2 proteins involved
in the Wnt/calcium pathway (CAMK2B and PRKCQ).

Twenty (62.5%) of the 32 genes were signiﬁcantly deregu-
lated in the 16 MPNSTs as compared with the 10 dermal
neuroﬁbromas (P < 0.05; Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S4):
14 genes were upregulated (WT5A, FZD1, FZD8, DKK1,
WIF1, LEF1, ID2, MSX2, SOX9, WISP1, TWIST1, BMP2,
CAMK2B, and PRKCQ) and 6 were downregulated (WNT2,
WNT9A, DKK3, KREMEN1, SFRP1, and TCF7) in MPNSTs.

These 20 deregulated genes in MPNSTs encode 3 Wnt
ligands (WNT2, WNT5A, and WNT9A), 2 Wnt receptors
(FZD1 and FZD8), 5 proteins involved in canonical Wnt
signal transduction (DKK1, DKK3, KREMEN1, SFRP1, and
WIF1), 2 transcription factors (LEF1 and TCF7), 6 LEF/TCF-
inducible proteins (ID2, MSX2, SOX9, WISP1, TWIST1, and
BMP2), and 2 proteins involved in the Wnt/calcium path-
way (CAMK2B and PRKCQ).

Taken together, our results showed that 4 genes were
speciﬁcally deregulated in plexiform neuroﬁbromas, 15
were speciﬁcally dysregulated in MPNSTs, and 6 were dys-
regulated in both tumor types.

In the same set of 57 samples, we also examined the
expression of the NF1 gene, and the proliferation-asso-
ciated gene MKI67 that encodes the proliferation-related
antigen Ki-67. NF1 expression was similar in the 3 groups
of tumors whereas MKI67 showed signiﬁcant overexpres-
sion (30.5-fold) in MPNSTs (P ¼ 0.00005; Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table S4). This lack of expression differ-
ence for NF1 is probably because of the fact that the NF1
gene is ubiquitously expressed and therefore expressed in
the different cell components of the neuroﬁbromas and
MPNSTs, and that NF1
Schwann cells represent only a
fraction of the total Schwann cell population in tumor
samples.

The immunohistochemical study of b-catenin in MPNSTs
showed a strong diffuse and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2). In

contrast, a weaker b-catenin staining was observed in the
plexiform neuroﬁbromas (Fig. 2).

mRNA expression of 32 identiﬁed Wnt pathway genes
in paired plexiform neuroﬁbroma and MPNST samples
from 4 patients

We analyzed the mRNA levels of the 32 deregulated genes
identiﬁed by "screening set" analysis in 4 patients from
whom both plexiform neuroﬁbroma and matched MPNST
samples were available. We found a clear decrease in the
mRNA level of WNT9A, DKK3, SFRP4 (all patients), and
WISP1 (patients 1, 3, and 4), upon progression from
plexiform neuroﬁbroma to MPNST (Supplementary Fig.
S2). We also found a clear increase in the mRNA level of
DKK1 (all patients), TLE2, TCF7, WNT2 (patients 1, 2, and
3), and WNT5A (patients 3 and 4) during this transition
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

mRNA expression of the 24 differentially expressed
Wnt pathway genes in 4 non-NF1 (sporadic) MPNSTs
The expression levels of the 24 differentially expressed
Wnt pathway genes were also determined in 4 non-NF1
(sporadic) human MPNST biopsies (Supplementary Table
S5). According with the data obtained in NF1-associated
MPNSTs, the majority of the 14 genes upregulated and of
the 6 downregulated in MPNST biopsies showed a trend to
be also up- and downregulated.

mRNA expression of the 24 differentially Wnt pathway
expressed genes in normal human Schwann cells,
ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, and mast cells

Neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs are both heterogeneous
tumors mainly composed of Schwann cells (60–80%),
together with ﬁbroblasts, mast cells, and endothelial cells
(3). To investigate cell type–speciﬁc expression of the 24
previously identiﬁed altered genes in NF1 plexiform neu-
roﬁbromas and/or MPNSTs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Table S4), we analyzed their mRNA levels by means of
real-time RT-PCR in normal human Schwann cells, ﬁbro-
blasts, endothelial cells, and mast cells (Table 1). MYC,
CAMK2B, KREMEN1, and BMP2 were similarly expressed
in the 4 cell types, suggesting a ubiquitous expression. TLE2,
DKK3, TCF7, FZD1, FZD8, and DKK1 were similarly
expressed in Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts, and endothelial

cells, but were not expressed in mast cells. Six of these
24 genes (WISP1, WNT5A, SFRP1, ID2, TWIST1, and SOX9)
were similarly expressed in Schwann cells and ﬁbroblasts,
but were not expressed (Ct > 32) in endothelial cells or
mast cells. WNT2, MSX2, LEF1, SFRP4, and SFRP5 were
Schwann cell–speciﬁc, being expressed more than 20
times in the Schwann cells than in the other 3 cell types.
PRKCQ was mainly expressed in endothelial cells and
mast cells, and WIF1 only in Schwann cells and endo-
thelial cells. Finally, WNT9A was endothelial cells speciﬁc
(being expressed 10 times more than in the other 3 cell
types). It is noteworthy that the endothelial cells speci-
ﬁcity of WNT9A could explain its expression proﬁle in
NF1 tumors, in particular its overexpression in plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (well-known to be more angiogenic than
the dermal neuroﬁbromas).

Wnt Pathway Activation in NF1 Tumorigenesis

mRNA expression of the 24 differentially expressed
Wnt pathway genes in 7 NF1-associated MPNST cell
lines

The expression levels of the 24 identiﬁed genes was
determined in 7 well-characterized NF1-associated MPNST
cell lines, namely NMS-2, NMS-2PC, 88-3, ST88-14, 90-8,
S462, and T265 (Table 2). All genes (except WT9A in
agreement with the fact that it is an endothelial cell–
speciﬁc gene) were expressed (Ct < 32) in at least 1 NF1-
associated MPNST cell
line. According with the data
obtained in MPNSTs, the majority of the 14 genes upre-
gulated and of the 6 downregulated in MPNST biopsies
was also up- and downregulated (>3-fold the median
value in 10 dermal neuroﬁbromas) in a fraction of the
MPNST cell lines. For example, WT5A, FZD8, DKK1,
WIF1, MSX2, and CAMK2B were upregulated in at least
5 of the 7 MPNST cell lines, whereas WNT2, WNT9A,
DKK3, KREMEN1, and SFRP1 were downregulated in at
least 5 of the 7 MPNST cell lines. These ﬁndings conﬁrm

the Schwann cell expression of these genes and their
dysregulation in MPNST tumorigenesis.

Relationship between mRNA levels of 24 differentially
expressed Wnt pathway genes and 2 major stem cell
markers (PROM1 and NKX2.2)

Several studies supported the role of the canonical Wnt
signaling in the formation and maintenance of stem cells
and cancer stem cells (14, 20–22). To explore the possible
involvement of the 24 identiﬁed Wnt genes (deregulated in
NF1 tumors) in the formation of cancer stem cells, we tested
the relationship between the expression of these 24 differ-
entially expressed Wnt genes and 2 major stem cell marker
genes, that is PROM1 (also known as CD133) and NKX2-2,
in our series of 57 NF1-associated tumors. PROM1 and
NKX2-2 were overexpressed (144- and 87-fold, respectively)
in MPNSTs (P ¼ 0.0007 and 0.002, respectively; Mann–
Whitney U test) suggesting an increase of the proportion of
cancer stem cells in this malign tumor group. We observed

Relationship between mRNA levels of 24 differentially
Wnt pathway expressed genes and 5 major EMT
markers (TWIST1, SLUG, SNAIL, VIM, and CDH1)

Regulation of the EMT is a crucial step in cancer devel-
opment. TWIST1, an important
transcription factor
involved in EMT and upregulated in NF1-associated MPNST
(19), is also a major LEF/TCF–inducible gene (http://www.
stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targets.html).
In conse-
quence, to explore the involvement of the Wnt pathway in
a possible Schwann–mesenchymal transition during NF1
tumorigenesis, we ﬁrst tested the expression of 5 major EMT
markers (TWIST1, SLUG, SNAIL, VIM, and CDH1) in our
series of 57 NF1-associated tumors. TWIST1 and SLUG were
overexpressed (1.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively) in the
MPNSTs (P ¼ 0.005 and 0.001, respectively), whereas
CDH1 was underexpressed (11-fold; P ¼ 0.0006). SNAIL
and VIM showed similar mRNA levels in dermal neuroﬁ-
bromas, plexiform neuroﬁbromas, and MPNSTs. We next
tested the relationship between the expression of the 24
identiﬁed Wnt genes and of the 3 differentially expressed
EMT marker genes (i.e., TWIST1, SLUG, and CDH1). We
observed high statistical signiﬁcant positive associations
(P < 0.01) between TWIST1 and FZD8, SFRP1, ID2, MSX2,
SOX9, and BMP2, between SLUG and WIF1 and BMP2, and
between CDH1 and KREMEN1. CDH1 and KREMEN1
showed a correlated decreased expression in MPNSTs
(Table 3). It is noteworthy that we observed a high statistical
signiﬁcant positive association between SLUG and both
PROM1 and NKX2-2 (P ¼ 0.0033 and 0.00068,
respectively).

In vitro consequences of NF1 inactivation on Wnt
pathway activation state

To analyze the effects of the NF1 gene inactivation on the
Wnt pathway, we knocked down the expression of NF1 in 2
human cell lines (an embryonic kidney cell line: HEK293

and a breast adenocarcinoma cell line: MCF-7) and 1 mouse
Schwann cell line (MSC80) by siRNAs strategy. Cells were
transfected with either a nontargeting siRNA (NT) or a
siRNA directed against NF1. The efﬁcacy of the knockdown
of the NF1 expression was tested by real-time RT-PCR and
Western blot. In MSC80 cell line, we found a decreased Nf1
expression at both mRNA and protein (neuroﬁbromin)
levels (Fig. 3A). In human cell lines (HEK293 and MCF-
7), a decreased NF1 expression was conﬁrmed at mRNA
level (data not shown).

In the 2 human cell lines (HEK293 and MCF-7), mRNA
expression of 24 Wnt pathway genes (cf. supra) was ana-
lyzed after the knockdown of NF1. Those 2 non-Schwann
cell lines showed no clear Wnt gene expression difference
for the majority of the 14 upregulated and the 6 down-
regulated genes in MPNST biopsies and no difference was
found in the amount of the active as well as the total
b-catenin quantiﬁed by Western blot (data not shown).

Similarly, no clear expression difference was found
between the MEFs derived from wild-type mice and the
MEFs derived from Nf1
mice, in the majority of the 14
upregulated and of the 6 downregulated genes in MPNST
biopsies (data not shown).

 / 

In MSC80 Schwann cells, we used a Wnt pathway reporter
assay to determine whether the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway was modulated after the knockdown of Nf1. The
silencing of Nf1 increased by 3-folds (P < 0.01) the pro-
moter activity of SuperTOP-Flash-Luc in MSC80 (Fig. 3B).
The knockdown of Nf1 did not alter the promoter activity of
SuperFOP-Flash-Luc, a construct that lacks any binding sites
for TCF/LEF transcription factors (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,
the transcript of Axin2, a target gene of Wnt pathway was
increased by 2-folds after the silencing of Nf1 in MSC80 cells
(Fig. 3C). To assess whether the knockdown of Nf1 altered
the expression of b-catenin at the protein level, we have
quantiﬁed by Western blot the amount of the active as well
as the total b-catenin. In MSC80 transfected with the siRNA
against Nf1, we observed a 2-folds increase of the ratio of
active-b-catenin/total-b-catenin compared with the control
cells (Fig. 3D).

Altogether, those data show that the knockdown of
NF1 in Schwann cells enhances the activity of Wnt/b-cate-
type–speciﬁc
nin pathway. Those data suggest

Figure 3. Effect of Nf1 knockdown on Wnt pathway in MSC80 cells. A, MSC80 cells were transfected with either siRNA-targeting NF1 or nontargeting siRNA
(NT). Western blots using anti-neuroﬁbromin antibodies were perfomed to verify Nf1 inactivation at protein level in MSC80 cells. GAPDH was used to normalize
the Western blots. Results were reproduced in 3 independent experiments, and ﬁgures represent a typical experiment. B, MSC80 cells were transiently
cotransfected by the SuperTOP-Flash Luciferase or SuperFOP-Flash Luciferase plasmids with either nontargeting (NT) siRNA or siRNA against NF1.
Luciferase activity was then analyzed. , P < 0.05, and , P < 0.01 by Tukey post hoc tests after one-way ANOVA when compared with control. C, MSC80 cells
were transfected with either NT or a siRNA against Nf1. Total RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR was performed using speciﬁc primer recognizing Axin2. D,
Western blots were performed using anti-active (dephosphorylated b-catenin) and anti-total b-catenin antibodies. GAPDH was used to normalize the Western
blots. The Western blots were quantiﬁed using Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov).

consequences of NF1 knockdown as Wnt pathway activa-
tion was not observed in epithelial (MCF-7) or kidney
(HEK293) cell lines, or in MEFs cells but only in Schwann
(MSC80) cell lines.

Discussion

WNT signaling pathway orchestrates highly complex
molecular events. Aberrant activation of Wnt pathway could
trigger cell malignant transformation. In the last 20 years,
involvement of the Wnt pathway has mainly been revealed
in human epithelial malignancies (31). However, the Wnt
pathway may also play a role in tumors of mesenchymal
origin (32). Mesenchymal stem cells could differentiate into
Schwann cell–like cells (33). In this work, we therefore
apprehended the role of Wnt pathway in NF1 tumorigenesis
and more particularly its link with cancer stem cells and
putative Schwann–mesenchymal transition.

Wnt pathway is tightly implicated in the myelination
process elicited by Schwann cells. We have shown that the
selective inhibition of Wnt components by siRNA or dom-
inant negative forms inhibits the expression of myelin genes
in mouse Schwann cells (34, 35). Moreover, the activation
of Wnt signaling by recombinant Wnt ligands increases the
transcription of myelin genes. Importantly, loss-of-function
analyses in zebraﬁsh embryos show, in vivo, a key role for

Wnt/b-catenin signaling in the initiation of myelination
and in myelin sheath compaction in the central and periph-
eral nervous systems. Inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling
resulted in hypomyelination, without affecting Schwann
cells and oligodendrocytes generation or axonal integrity
(21). Thus, the dysregulation of this pathway could lead to
either developmental defects or tumorigenesis.

Nine genes were signiﬁcantly deregulated in plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (as compared with dermal neuroﬁbromas):
8 genes were upregulated and 1 was downregulated
(Table 4). All these genes (except WNT9A, which seems
endothelial cell speciﬁc) were expressed in normal and
tumoral Schwann cells (Table 2). Our results show that
among the 3 different Wnt pathways, the canonical Wnt
pathway is mainly involved in plexiform neuroﬁbroma
development with deregulation of genes encoding major
components of this Wnt pathway (Table 4). Little is known
about the relevance of these genes (except MYC) to cancer
biology. A few observations have however described impli-
cations of these genes in several cancer types (36–40). Taken
together, these ﬁndings suggest an alteration of the canon-
ical Wnt pathway FZD1/SFRP1/TLE2/MYC in plexiform
neuroﬁbroma development.

Our results also showed a major activation of the Wnt
canonical pathway during the malignant transformation of
plexiform neuroﬁbromas in MPNSTs from NF1 patients.

The genes indicated in bold were found altered both in plexiform neuroﬁbromas and in MPNSTs.
The canonical Wnt pathway is mainly involved in plexiform neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs. Eight genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated
(WNT9A, FZD1, SFRP4, SFRP5, TLE2, MYC, CAMK2B, and PRKCQ) and one was downregulated (SFRP1) in plexiform neuroﬁbromas
(as compared with dermal neuroﬁbromas). Fourteen genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated (WT5A, FZD1, FZD8, DKK1, WIF1, LEF1,
MSX2, ID2, WISP1, BMP2, TWIST1, SOX9, CAMK2B, and PRKCQ), and 6 were downregulated (WNT2, WNT9A, SFRP1, DKK3,
KREMEN1, and TCF7) in MPNSTs.

Indeed, 20 genes were signiﬁcantly deregulated in the 16
NF1-related MPNSTs and the 7 MPNST cell lines (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table S4). These deregulated genes encode
molecules mainly involved in the canonical Wnt pathway
(Table 4). Among them, TWIST1 and more recently SOX9
have already been identiﬁed as major genes involved in NF1
tumorigenesis (19, 41). By using immunohistochemical
analysis, we conﬁrmed an activation of the Wnt canonical
pathway during the malignant transformation of plexiform
neuroﬁbromas in MPNSTs from NF1 patients (Fig. 3).

Wnt pathway expression analysis in a small set of non-
NF1 (sporadic) MPNSTs also suggested an activation of the
canonical Wnt pathway, as in the NF1-related MPNSTs. Our
observation conﬁrms previous results showing no differ-
ence in whole transcriptome proﬁling between sporadic
and NF1-related MPNSTs that both present inactivation of
the 2 NF1 alleles (42).

An activation of the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway
was also shown during the malignant transformation of
plexiform neuroﬁbromas in MPNSTs. Finally, our results
showed a total absence of involvement of the second
noncanonical Wnt pathway-planar cell polarity path-
way—both in plexiform neuroﬁbroma genesis, as well as
in MPNSTs.

Very little is known about the link between Wnt pathway
and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) RAS/MAPK and PI3K/
AKT signaling pathways that are activated in NF1 tumori-
genesis via the inactivation of the neuroﬁbromin (encoded
by NF1), which functions as a negative regulator of the RAS
proteins. However, several studies with culture cells showed
that activation of various tyrosine kinases (ERBB2, MET,
and RON) can increase b-catenin signaling (43–45).
Moreover, STI-571 (Glivec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor,

downregulates the b-catenin–signaling activity and sup-
presses cell proliferation (46). Finally, additional studies
showed that RAS pathway activation can strongly cooperate
with Wnt signaling to drive development of several type of
carcinoma in vivo (47, 48), and that PI3K/AKT pathway can
regulate Wnt signaling in various cancers (49). Our study
emphasizes the potential cooperative link between Wnt
pathway and RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways
in NF1-associated tumorigenesis. To translate our observa-
tions into potential therapies, further studies will crucial to
know which pathway(s) are critical for this link.

We conﬁrmed the NF1/WNT pathway crosstalk at the
functional level. We showed that the silencing of the Nf1
gene stimulated Wnt pathway activation in Schwann cell
lines, as in an in vitro model. Nf1 knockdown induced (i) a
Wnt pathway luciferase reporter assay activation, and (ii) an
increased active-b-catenin/total-b-catenin ratio (Fig. 3).
Our data also suggest Schwann cell–speciﬁc consequences
of NF1 knockdown as no signiﬁcant Wnt gene expression
variation was found in 3 non-Schwann cell types (HEK293,
MCF-7, and MEFs).

We observed a strong association between Wnt pathway
activation and both cancer stem cell reservoir (as judged on
the expression level of stem cell markers PROM1 and
NKX2.2) and Schwann–mesenchymal transition (as judged
on the expression level of EMT markers TWIST1, SLUG, and
CDH1; Table 3). It is noteworthy that NKX2.2 and TWIST1
are major Wnt targets (http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/
pathways/targets.html; ref. 50). Several studies suggested
that mesenchymal stem cells could differentiate into
Schwann cell–like cells in physiological conditions (32).
In consequence, activation of Wnt signaling in NF1 tumor-
igenesis could promote the dedifferentiation of the tumoral

Schwann cells into tumoral mesenchyme cell-like. During
the process of Schwann cell–mesenchyme transition, cell–
cell adhesion may be downregulated and a mesenchymal
phenotype acquired, associated with increased interaction
with the extracellular matrix and an enhanced migratory
capacity. These mesenchyme cell-like could be character-
ized by a higher ability to self-renew and to induce tumor-
igenesis, both characteristics of cancer stem cells. In this
regard, we previously showed a downexpression of several
key genes in the Schwann cell lineage (ERBB3, ITGB4, and
SOX1) as well as that the deregulation of the Hedgehog
pathway (19). Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch pathways are the
3 major signaling pathways that regulate the proliferation of
both endogenous normal stem cells and cancer stem cells
(22). For example, Clement and colleagues suggest the
Hedgehog pathway is involved in the regulation of the
glioma cancer stem cells (51).

Finally, we assume that activation of the Wnt signaling
pathway in NF1 tumorigenesis could explain the numerous
skeletal manifestations in NF1 patients. Indeed, Wnt sig-
naling is suggested to be the major common pathway
leading to bone formation, with bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMP) as only factors capable of initiating osteo-
blastogenesis from mesenchymal progenitors. Double inac-
tivation of the NF1 gene was observed in bone dysplasia
found in NF1 (52). In this study, we showed upregulation of
BMP2 in MPNST samples. We can hypothesize that activa-
tion of Wnt pathway impaired NF1
osteoblasts differ-
entiation, and has a major role in osseous abnormalities
observed in the patients with NF1.

 / 

In conclusion, our study reveals that activation of the Wnt
signaling pathway is consistently seen in NF1 tumorigen-
esis. Full conﬁrmation of the role of this pathway in NF1
needs further in vivo (animal model) studies. Our results
