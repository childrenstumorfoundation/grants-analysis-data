Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which may occur as an autosom-
al dominant disorder, is caused by the absence of neurofibromin 
protein due to somatic mutations in the NF1 gene, and it has 
been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Herein 
we describe a family with two women affected by both NF1 and 
early-onset breast cancer. We evaluated whether the concomi-
tance of NF1 and early-onset breast cancer could be due to dis-
ease-causing mutations in both NF1 and BRCA1 gene in a Ko-
rean family with clinical features of both NF1 and hereditary 

breast cancer. Mutation analyses identified nonsense mutations 
in NF1 and BRCA1 genes. Our findings indicate that an aware-
ness of the possible concomitance of NF1 and BRCA1 gene 
mutations is important for identifying the genetic origin of early-
onset breast cancer in patients with NF1 to achieve early detec-
tion of cancers and decrease breast cancer-associated morbidi-
ty and mortality in these patients.

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder with an approximate incidence ranging from 1/2,500 
to 1/3,000 and a prevalence ranging from 1/2,000 to 1/5,000 
in the United States and United Kingdom [1,2]. Patients with 
NF1 have various manifestations, such as café au lait spots, 
neurofibromas, intertriginous freckling, innocuous iris ham-
artomas termed Lisch nodules, and bony dysplasia of the long 
bones, which all result from the lack of neurofibromin pro-
tein. Importantly, NF1 gene is a tumor-suppressor gene, and 
the absence of neurofibromin resulting from somatic NF1 
gene mutations has been associated with an increased risk of 
developing low- and high-grade gliomas and systemic malig-
nancies, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, somatostati-
nomas, pheochromocytomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, leuke-
mias, and breast cancer [3-5]. 

Breast cancer has also been shown to be associated with 
NF1. Previous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that

women with NF1 have a three- to five-fold increased risk of 
breast cancer compared with the general population. In par-
ticular, the increased risk appears to be specific to women un-
der 50 years of age [4,6-8]. Although women with NF1 have 
an increased risk of breast cancer, breast cancer in women 
with NF1 comprises only a small portion of all breast cancer 
cases. Furthermore, reports of hereditary breast cancer in 
women with NF1 in the literature are few. Among the few 
cases of an association between NF1 mutations and hereditary 
breast cancer identified through mutation analysis, none is 
from the Korean population [9-11].

We identified a Korean family with two women affected by 
both NF1 and hereditary breast cancer. Because both the NF1 
and BRCA1 genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 
17, we evaluated whether the concomitance of these two her-
editary disorders could be due to deleterious mutations in 
both the NF1 and BRCA genes in a Korean family with clinical 
features of both NF1 and hereditary breast cancer.

serving surgery. The proband was treated with adjuvant che-
motherapy (six cycles of a regimen consisting of 5-fluoroura-

apy, and is currently receiving endocrine therapy (tamoxifen). 
NF1 was diagnosed at birth, as established by the presence of 
café au lait spots, intertriginous freckling, and cutaneous neu-
rofibromas.

Her mother (II:1) was also diagnosed with NF1 that pre-
sented as café au lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas at 
birth. She underwent a modified radical mastectomy for right 
invasive ductal breast carcinoma (T2N0M0, ER and PR posi-
tive, HER2 negative) at the age of 30 years. After surgery, she 
was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (six cycles of a regi-

The proband (III:2) was diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma at 21 
years of age and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) at birth. Her mother 
(II:1) was affected with bilateral breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma 
and NF1. Although her grandmother (I:1) was affected by NF1, she did 
not have a history of carcinoma. Other familial members were not af-
fected by cancer or NF1.

phosphamide) and endocrine therapy. After 5 years, she un-
derwent breast conserving surgery for left invasive ductal 
breast carcinoma (T2N2M0, ER and PR positive, HER2 nega-
tive). After the second surgery, she was treated with chemo-
therapy (six cycles of a regimen of taxotere, epirubicin, and cy-
clophosphamide) and radiation therapy. Two years after the 
second surgery, she underwent a radical hysterectomy and 
both oophorectomy due to ovarian cancer. Despite continuous 
chemotherapy, the ovarian carcinoma rapidly progressed and 
she died of metastatic ovarian carcinoma at 41 years of age.

No familial history of breast cancer or NF1 was noted in the 
proband’s paternal pedigree. The mutational analysis results of 
her father were normal. In addition, her maternal aunt, uncle, 
and brother did not have a history of carcinoma or exhibit 
manifestations of NF1; these family members did not undergo 
mutation analyses because they did not provide informed 
consent. Although her grandmother (I:1) had NF1 and pre-
sented with café au lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas, 
she had no history of carcinoma.

Given that two women in a single family were affected by 
both NF1 and hereditary breast/ovary cancer, we evaluated 
whether the concomitance of these two hereditary disorders 
was attributed to an NF1 gene mutation and its potentially as-
sociated increased risk of breast cancer or to disease-causing 
mutations in both NF1 and BRCA1/2 genes. We analyzed the 
DNA of the proband affected by NF1 and early-onset breast 
cancer. All DNA samples were extracted from peripheral 
blood according to standard procedures after informed con-
sent was obtained. Specific NF1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 coding 
regions and intron-exon boundaries were amplified using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence alterations were 
confirmed at the genomic level with PCR amplification and 
direct full sequencing using sense and antisense primers. We 
used the sequence nomenclature of the Lab Genomics Muta-
tion Database, which follows the recommendations of the 
Human Gene Mutation Database.

The NF1 gene sequence analysis identified a nonsense mu-
tation in exon 27, c.3616G>T (p.Glu1206), in the index case 
(Figure 2A). This change (the 3616th nucleotide G is convert-

a glutamate (GAG), into a premature stop codon (TAG). Our 
BRCA1 gene sequence analysis detected a nonsense mutation 
in exon 7, 509C>A (p.Tyr130X), in the same patient (Figure 
2B). The 509th nucleotide C was converted into A, which 
causes the 130th amino acid, a tyrosine (TAC), to be convert-
ed into a premature stop codon (TAA). However, No BRCA2 
gene mutations were identified in the same patient’s peripher-
al blood DNA.

DISCUSSION

Three previous population-based studies have demonstrat-
ed that women  <50 years of age with NF1 have an increased 
risk of breast cancer [4,6-8]. Walker et al. [4] found that wom-
en  <50 years of age with NF1 had a standardized incidence 
ratio (SIR) of 4.0 (p=0.037; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.1–10.3) for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Similarly, Sharif et 
al. [6] and Madanikia et al. [7] reported SIRs of 4.9 (p<0.05; 
95% CI, 2.4–8.8) and 2.68 (p=0.076; 95% CI, 0.68–7.29), re-
spectively, for breast cancer in women  <50 years of age. Fur-
thermore, Evans et al. [8] reported that there is not only an in-
creased risk of breast cancer in women with NF1, but also a 
higher rate of death associated with the breast cancer diagno-
sis. The authors of these studies agree that women with NF1 
are at a moderately increased risk of developing breast cancer 
and that early screening in these women is necessary.

Some authors have hypothesized that the concomitance of 
these two hereditary disorders could be attributed to disease-
causing mutations in both the NF1 and BRCA1/2 genes. One 
study determined that two individuals, a mother and daugh-
ter affected by breast and peritoneal cancer, respectively, were 
carriers of a nonsense BRCA1 gene mutation [11]. However, 
this report did not include an analysis of the NF1 gene, and it 
had the limitation of a single-strand conformation polymor-
phism. Another study reported a mother and daughter affect-
ed by breast cancer at 23 and 58 years of age, respectively [12]. 
Moreover, the proband and her brother were diagnosed with 
NF1; however, no NF1, BRCA1, or BRCA2 gene mutations 
were observed in the proband’s peripheral blood DNA. The 
authors reported that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of 
the breast tumor revealed LOH in the NF1 region. However, 
this report did not present the direct full sequencing analysis 
of the NF1 and BRCA genes, and the study neglected the fact 
that the breast tumor exhibited LOH at several loci [6].

Similar to our report, Campos et al. [13] presented a family 
with two women affected by both NF1 and early-onset breast 
cancer. Our study identified nonsense mutations in NF1 gene 
and BRCA1 gene, whereas Campos et al. identified a frame 

99

shift mutation in BRCA1 gene and a nonsense mutation in 
NF1 in the index case. Additionally, our study and that by 
Campos et al. did not identify mutations in NF1 and BRCA1 
gene in the proband’s mother, who was affected with NF1 and 
early-onset breast cancer, as she was deceased prior to the 
study. Although Campos et al. estimated that the proband’s 
mother was probably a carrier of mutations in NF1 and 
BRCA1 gene based on her diagnoses of NF1 and early-onset 
breast cancer, early-onset breast cancer is not always associat-
ed with BRCA1 gene mutations. In the current study, we did 
not determine whether the BRCA1 gene mutation in the pro-
band was vertically transmitted from her mother or was a 
new mutation in the proband.

To our knowledge, this study is the first report describing 
the concomitant presentation of NF1 and hereditary breast 
cancer in a Korean family. NF1 and BRCA gene analyses in the 
proband identified c.3646G>T (p.Glu1206) and 509C>A 
(p.Tyr130X) nonsense mutations, respectively. Although we 
could not analyze NF1 and BRCA genes in the proband’s 
mother, we strongly suspect that her mother carried NF1 and 
BRCA1 gene mutations, given her development of bilateral 
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome at a young age. The proband 
and her mother were both affected by early-onset breast can-
cer, and the degree of the relationship via vertical transmission 
is suggestive of a genetic predisposition to hereditary breast 
cancer caused by a mutation in BRCA1 gene. Therefore, be-
cause the proband is likely to develop ovarian cancer, we will 
closely monitor this patient. 

In conclusion, an awareness of the possibility of concomi-
tant NF1 and BRCA1 gene mutations is important for the 
identification of the genetic origins of early-onset breast cancer 
in patients with NF1. Compared with the general population 
and women with BRCA1 gene mutations, breast cancer 
screening guidelines have not been established for patients 
with NF1 to decrease breast cancer-associated mortality 
through early diagnosis. Our findings suggest that early and 
annual clinical and radiographic screenings for breast cancer 
in women with NF1 may be important to achieve early detec-
tion of cancers and decrease breast cancer-associated morbidi-
ty and mortality.
