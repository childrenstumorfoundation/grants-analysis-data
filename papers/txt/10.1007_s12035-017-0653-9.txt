Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary
brain tumor. The rapid growth and the privileged provenance
of the tumor within the brain contribute to its aggressivity and
poor therapeutic targeting. A poor prognostic factor in glio-
blastoma is the deletion or mutation of the Nf1 gene. This gene
codes for the protein neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor gene
that is known to interact with the collapsin response mediator
protein 2 (CRMP2). CRMP2 expression and elevated expres-
sion of nuclear phosphorylated CRMP2 have recently been
implicated in ca ncer pro gression. The CRMP2-
neurofibromin interaction protects CRMP2 from its phosphor-
ylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), an event linked
to cancer progression. In three human glioblastoma cell lines
(GL15, A172, and U87), we observed an inverse correlation
between neurofibromin expression and CRMP2 phosphoryla-
tion levels. Glioblastoma cell proliferation was dependent on
CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation by Cdk5 and

glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). The CRMP2 phos-
phorylation inhibitor (S)-lacosamide reduces, in a
concentration-dependent manner, glioblastoma cell prolifera-
tion and induced apoptosis in all three GBM cell lines tested.
Since (S)-lacosamide is bioavailable in the brain, we tested its
utility in an in vivo orthotopic model of GBM using GL261-
LucNeo glioma cells. (S)-lacosamide decreased tumor size, as
measured via in vivo bioluminescence imaging, by ~54%
compared to vehicle control. Our results introduce CRMP2
expression and phosphorylation as a novel player in GBM
proliferation and survival, which is enhanced by loss of Nf1.

Introduction

Among central nervous system tumors, glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), a WHO grade IVastrocytoma, is the most
aggressive form. Despite recent advances in treatment proto-
cols [1] and advanced molecular studies [2, 3], the median
survival for GBM patients remains approximately 14 months
[2]. Poor patient survival is due to a multitude of factors,
including late stage at diagnosis, treatment resistance, and a
lack of drugs capable of reaching invasive cells that reside
behind the blood-brain barrier [2, 4]. An important molecular
signature in glioblastoma is the loss or mutation of the Nf1
gene, which codes for the protein neurofibromin. Nf1 alter-
ations are negatively linked to GBM patients’ survival [5–7]
and are enriched in the mesenchymal subgroup of GBM [3].
Recurrence of GBM after treatment involves a shift towards a
mesenchymal subtype [8, 9]. Also, it was suggested that Nf1
loss in GBM can happen over time even if the primary tumor
did not initially show alteration of the Nf1 gene [10]. Thus,

4404

Nf1 loss contributes to GBM recurrence and is linked to lower
survival of patients. Neurofibromin is an anti-oncogene whose
most established function is to inactivate the pro-oncogene
Ras [11], an event that promotes gliomagenesis [12, 13].
However, neurofibromin has other known protein partners
that may facilitate pro-oncogenic mechanisms—one of these
proteins is collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2).
CRMP2 is an axonal growth and guidance protein [14–16]
that binds to the C-terminus of neurofibromin [17]. This
protein-protein interaction inhibits CRMP2 phosphorylation
by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which, in turn, pro-
motes neurite outgrowth [17]. Loss of neurofibromin results
in increased CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 [17], an event
linked to cancer progression [18, 19]. Gain of CRMP2 phos-
phorylation at the Ser522 site by Cdk5 has been previously
described in lymphoma [18], as well as in breast [18, 20] and
lung [12, 21], cancers. Recently, loss of CRMP1 [22] and gain
of CRMP5 [23]—two other members of the CRMP family—
were reported to participate in glioblastoma oncogenic mech-
anisms. Since Nf1 loss is a hallmark in glioblastoma [3, 5, 6]
and is linked to lower survival [5, 6] and recurrence [8, 9], and
neurofibromin inhibits CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5
[17], an event linked to cancer progression [18, 19], we hy-
pothesized the CRMP2 phosphorylation is an important mo-
lecular event driving glioblastoma cell proliferation and
survival.

Here, we demonstrate that neurofibromin protein levels are
inversely correlated with CRMP2 phosphorylation levels.
Equally importantly, we demonstrate that CRMP2 expression
promotes GBM cell proliferation. This novel function is
governed by CRMP2’s phosphorylation status since express-
ing phosphorylation-deficient CRMP2 mutants prevented
CRMP2-dependent GBM cell proliferation. (S)-lacosamide
((S)-LCM), an inactive analog of the clinically approved small
molecule anti-epileptic drug (R)-lacosamide (Vimpat®) [24],
inhibited CRMP2 phosphorylation at S522 [25–27] in three
human GBM cell lines. (S)-lacosamide decreased in cell pro-
liferation in vitro, which was linked to induction of apoptosis.
In the final series of experiments, we evaluated the ability of
(S)-lacosamide to inhibit growth of orthotopic tumors in vivo,
in a syngeneic model of murine GBM.

Methods

Materials Human cell lines GL15 [28], A172 (American Type
Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA; CRL_1620),
and U87 (ATCC® HTB-14™) were authenticated as reported
previously [23] using short tandem repeat DNA profiling and
maintained in appropriate media. GL261-LucNeo glioma line
was described earlier [29]. Antibodies used in this study are
anti-CRMP2 polyclonal antibody (Cat# 2993, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO), anti-neurofibromin N-terminal (Cat# sc-68,

Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), CRMP2 pSer522
(Cat# CP2191, ECM Biosciences), and actin (Cat# A2066,
Sigma). For RNA interference, short interfering RNA
(siRNA) CRMP2 (5′-GTAAACTCCTTCCTCGTGT-3′)
(specificity validated previously [30, 31]) and siRNA control
(Cat# 12935300) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Waltham, MA). A BLAST search of siRNA sequences against
the human transcriptome did not reveal potential off-target ef-
fects. (S)-N-benzyl 2-acetamido-3-methoxypropionamide ((S)-
lacosamide; (S)-LCM) was synthesized as described previously
[32]. Plasmids coding for Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein
(dsRed) fused to wild-type and phospho-deficient CRMP2
were as reported earlier by Dustrude and colleagues [31].

Nucleic Acid Transfection Indicated cell lines were plated to
reach 50% confluency on the next day. Transfection was done
using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For siRNA transfections, a final concentration
of 200 nM was used. For plasmid transfection, a 2:1
Lipofectamine 2000/DNA ratio was used. In all cases, trans-
fection was prepared in OptiMEM and added dropwise onto
the cells. The media was changed 24 h later, and the cells were
used the next day (i.e., a total of 48 h after transfection).
Plasmid transfection was verified by dsRed fluorescence,
and knockdown was verified by Western blot.

Immunocytofluorescence Indicated cells were grown on
sterile glass coverslip 15 mm in 12-well plates. After 2 days
in culture, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed using ice-cold methanol for 5 min.
After removal, cells were allowed to dry at room temperature
and conserved in PBS at 4 °C until staining. Non-specific
antibody binding sites were saturated with 3% [m/v] bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and
then, the indicated primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h
at room temperature in 3% BSA in PBS. Cells were washed
three times for 5 min at room temperature with PBS; 3% BSA
and secondary antibodies were added at 1/2000 dilution in
PBS containing 3% BSA for 1-h incubation at room temper-
ature. After three washing steps (5 min each) with PBS with
3% BSA at room temperature followed by two washes with
PBS, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Cat# D1306,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added on the cells at 50 ng/
mL in PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
Stained cells were washed three times in PBS for 5 min at
room temperature and then mounted in Fluoro-Gel medium
(Cat# 11985-11, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA)
and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Controls with secondary
antibody alone without primary antibody did not show any
non-specific fluorescent signal. Immunofluorescent micro-
graphs were acquired on an Olympus BX51 microscope with
a Hamamatsu C8484 digital camera using a 20× UplanSApo
0.75 numerical aperture objective. The freeware image

analysis program ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used
to generate merged images.

Western Blot Indicated samples were lysed in RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% [v/
v] NP40, 0.5% [m/v] sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% [m/v] SDS)
as described previously [31, 33, 34]. The RIPA buffer includ-
ed freshly added protease inhibitors (Cat# B14002; Biotools,
Houston, TX), phosphatase inhibitors (Cat# B15002,
Biotools), and benzonase (Cat# 71206, Millipore, Billerica,
MA). Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA protein assay (Cat# PI23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA), and samples were prepared at a 1 μg/μL con-
centration in Laemmli buffer. Indicated samples were loaded
on Novex™ WedgeWell™ 4–20% Tris-Glycine Mini Gels,
15 wells (Cat# XP04205BOX, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Proteins were transferred for 1 h at 100 V
using TGS (25 mM Tris pH = 8.5, 192 mM glycine, 0.1%
(m/v) SDS), 20% (v/v) methanol as transfer buffer to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes 0.45 μm
(Cat# IPVH00010, Millipore, Billerica, MA), preactivated in
pure methanol. After transfer, the membranes were blocked at
room temperature for 1 h with TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), 5% (m/v) non-fat dry
milk, then incubated separately in indicated primary antibod-
ies in TBST, 5% (m/v) BSA, overnight at 4 °C. Following
incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch, blots were revealed
by enhanced luminescence (WBKLS0500, Millipore,
Billerica, MA) before exposure to photographic film. Films
were scanned, digitized, and quantified using Un-Scan-It gel
version 6.1 scanning software by Silk Scientific Inc.

Cell Proliferation Assay Cell proliferation was analyzed
using Click-IT 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; a nucleoside
analog of thymidine; Cat# A10044, Thermo Fisher) at 25 μg/
mL added 4 h before fixation in culture medium. Cells were
fixed with pure ice-cold methanol, 5 min, then dried and
stored in PBS at 4 °C until use. Either Alexa Fluor 488-
Azide (Cat# A10266, Thermo Fisher) or Alexa Fluor 594-
Azide (Cat# A10270, Thermo Fisher) was used in 100 mM
Tris, 1 mM CuSO4, and 100 mM ascorbic acid, pH = 8.0 for
30 min at room temperature, protected from light, to reveal
incorporated EdU. Nuclei were stained using DAPI.
Immunofluorescent micrographs were acquired on an
Olympus BX51 microscope with a Hamamatsu C8484 digital
camera using a 20× UplanSApo 0.75 numerical aperture ob-
jective. The freeware image analysis program ImageJ (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to generate images. Analysis
was performed by manual counting EdU-stained cells on mul-
tiple representative fields to determine proliferation index ra-
tio (EdU/DAPI) in each samples. Results are from three inde-
pendent experiments.

Annexin-V Apoptosis Assay Cell apoptosis was analyzed
using annexin V (Cat# A13203, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
e x t r a c e l l u l a r s t ai n i n g . T h i s s t a i n i de n t i f i e s t h e
phosphatidylserine relocalized to the outer leaflet of the plas-
ma membrane in apoptotic conditions. Indicated cells were
washed with cold PBS and then incubated in annexin-
binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM
CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 15 at room temperature, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were washed in cold
PBS and then imaged. Analysis was performed by manual
counting (by an experimenter blinded to the condition) of
highly stained cells from multiple representative fields to de-
termine the percentage of apoptosis in each sample. Results
are from three independent experiments.

In Vivo Tumor Treatment Studies All procedures and ani-
mal care practices were approved and performed in accor-
dance with the Barrow Neurological Institute’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tumor Induction GL261-LucNeo cells were grown in T25
flasks in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) con-
taining glucose, L-glutamine, and 10% FBS and supplement-
ed with the aminoglycoside antibiotic G-418 (Geneticin), as a
LucNeo selection pressure, at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and main-
tained under normal adherent culture conditions. Cells were
collected with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and a Cellometer mini
(Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA, USA) was used to
count cells. Orthotopic GL261-LucNeo tumors were induced
in C57BL/6 albino mice (25–30 g, Charles River) as previ-
ously reported [35–37]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with
an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine/xylazine (100/
10 mg/kg) prior to being mounted in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) on top of an infrared heating
pad to maintain animal temperature. The animal’s head was
shaved and sterilized with three alternating passes of each
betadine and ethanol. A 1-cm incision was made over midline,
and a burr hole was drilled 2 mm lateral, 0.1 mm posterior of
bregma. A Hamilton syringe (29-gauge needle) containing
75,000 GL261-LucNeo cells in 2 μL DMEM was inserted
into the hole to a depth of 2.8 mm, and the cells were injected
over 2 min. The needle was left in place for 1 min to reduce
backflow before the wound was closed with staples. All ani-
mals received a subcutaneous (SQ) injection of buprenorphine
sustained-release formulation prior to surgery, and ibuprofen
was provided in their water ad libitum for 1 week for pain.

Immunohistofluorescence and Epifluorescence Imaging
Mouse brains injected with GL261 cells (at day 17 post-
injection) were perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde. They
were next transferred into a 30% sucrose solution and left at
4 °C until the sinking of the tissues could be observed
(~3 days). Tissues were cut at 10-μm thickness using the

4406

Bright OTF 5000 Microtome Cryostat (Hacker Instruments and
Industries, Inc., Winnsboro, SC) and fixed onto gelatin-coated
glass slides and kept at −20 °C until use. Brain slices were
permeabilized and saturated using PBS containing 3% BSA
and 0.1% Triton X-100 solution for 30 min at RT, and then,
antibodies were added overnight. The antibodies used were
CRMP2 (Cat# C2993, Sigma, St. Louis, MO or Cat# 11096,
Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Minneapolis, USA) and
CRMP2 pSer522 (Cat# CP2191, ECM Biosciences,
Versailles, KY). The slices were then washed three times in
PBS and incubated with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.3%
Triton X-100 containing secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies)) for at least
3 h at RT. After three washes (PBS, 10 min, RT), either DAPI
was used to stain the nuclei of cells. Slides were mounted and
stored at 4 °C until analysis. Immunofluorescent micrographs
were acquired on an Olympus BX51 microscope with a
Hamamatsu C8484 digital camera using a 4× UplanFL N
0.13 numerical aperture or a 20× UplanSApo 0.75 numerical
aperture objective. The freeware image analysis program
ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to generate
merged images.

Tumor Growth Bioluminescence was used to monitor and
measure tumor growth as previously described [35, 37].
Imaging was done on the Xenogen IVIS Spectrum in vivo
imaging system every 3–4 days starting 6 days after tumor
implantation. Luciferin (150 mg/kg) was administered SQ,
and the mice were imaged 25 min later under 2% isoflurane.
The Living Image software was used to draw an ROI around
the tumor signal and measure the size of each tumor (total
flux, photons/s).

Tumor Treatment Mice were randomly assigned to a treat-
ment group, saline or (S)-lacosamide (30 mg/kg, i.p.), after the
first imaging session (day 6). Treatments were administered
daily by i.p. injection for 10 days beginning on day 7 post-
tumor induction. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by mea-
suring tumor growth via bioluminescence. Mice were moni-
tored daily for signs of neurological symptoms (lack of
grooming, abnormal gait, hunched posture, etc.) or greater
than 15% weight loss. Investigators were blinded to the treat-
ment condition.

Data Analysis All data columns are shown as mean ± SEM.
In Western blots, n is presented as the number of separate
experiments (minimum of 3). Western blots were quantified
using Un-Scan-It gel version 6.1 (Silk Scientific Inc., Orem,
UT). Statistical differences between control and experimental
conditions were determined by using Mann-Whitney non-
parametric test followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test or a
Mann-Whitney non-parametric test when comparing only
two conditions within R software (R-project). p values <0.05

were judged to be statistically significant. Graphs were gener-
ated using GraphPad Prism 7 software.

Neurofibromin Expression Levels Correlate with CRMP2
Phosphorylation Levels in Glioblastoma

In glioblastoma, loss of neurofibromin, the protein product of
the nf1 gene, is a marker of poor survival and resistance to
treatments [5, 6]. This loss results in dysregulation of
neurofibromin-interacting proteins including the oncogene
Ras [11] and CRMP2 [17]. The interaction between CRMP2
and neurofibromin results in inhibition of CRMP2 phosphor-
ylation by Cdk5 [17]. Notably, CRMP2 phosphorylation, but
not expression, levels have been positively linked to cancer
progression [18, 19]. Thus, we investigated the correlation
between CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation levels with
neurofibromin expression in glioblastoma. We used three dif-
ferent human GBM cell lines to account for the very high
heterogeneity of the tumors [10]. By Western blot analysis,
we first characterized neurofibromin expression in the three
different GBM cell lines (Fig. 1a). Although all three cell lines
had detectable neurofibromin levels, we found that the U87
cells had the highest level of neurofibromin expression
(253 ± 12.1% compared to GL15 cell level, p < 0.0001,
Kruskal-Wallis test) and A172 cells had the lowest expression
of neurofibromin (66 ± 5.5% compared to GL15 cell level,
p < 0.041, Kruskal-Wallis test) (Fig. 1a, b). We next examined
CRMP2 expression levels in the three GBM cell lines and
found that CRMP2 expression was highest in U87
(282.4 ± 7.1%, p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test) and lowest
in A172 (58 ± 5.5%, p < 0.0109, Kruskal-Wallis test) cells
compared to GL15 cells (Fig. 1a, b). Finally, we analyzed
CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 levels using an antibody
specific to the S522 phosphorylation site on CRMP2. The
phosphorylated CRMP2 signal was normalized to CRMP2
expression level for each cell line. We found that CRMP2
phosphorylation at the S522 site was increased in A172 cells
(142 ± 4.4%, p < 0.011, Kruskal-Wallis test) and decreased in
U87 cells (64 ± 6.7%, p < 0.0333, Kruskal-Wallis test) com-
pared to levels in GL15 cells (Fig. 1a, b). These results high-
light the differential expression of neurofibromin, CRMP2,
and phosphorylated CRMP2 in glioblastoma. Since
CRMP2’s interaction with neurofibromin results in inhibition
of CRMP2 phosphorylation, we asked if neurofibromin levels
would be correlated with CRMP2 phosphorylation levels.
Using a Pearson correlation analysis from our Western blot
data (Fig. 1a, b), we found that more neurofibromin levels
correlated inversely with phosphorylated CRMP2 (S522)
levels in GBM cells (Fig. 1c) (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.0094). Thus,
in the glioblastoma lines tested here, less neurofibromin, an

phosphorylation.

Phosphorylated CRMP2 Is Localized in the Nucleus
of Glioblastoma Cells

Previous studies have shown that subcellular localization of
phosphorylated CRMP2 is altered in cancer cells [18, 21].

Thus, we examined localization of CRMP2 and phosphory-
lated CRMP2 in glioblastoma cells using fluorescent immu-
nostaining. We detected total CRMP2 in both the cytoplasm
and the nucleus of the three GBM cell lines (Fig. 2, top
panels). In contrast, phosphorylated CRMP2 (S522) was only
detected in the nucleus of the three GBM cell lines (Fig. 2,
bottom panels). These results show that CRMP2 phos-
phorylation (S522) is relocalized in the nucleus of GBM
cells. Such nuclear localization for CRMP2 was de-
scribed previously in lung cancer and was suggested
to have a role in cell proliferation [21].

CRMP2 Expression Participates in Glioblastoma Cell
Proliferation

CRMP2 expression in glioblastoma and its localization in the
cytoplasm and in the nucleus suggest a role for this protein in
this tumor. In glioblastoma, the fast-growing behavior of the
tumors likely accounts for the lower survival of patients [23].
To assess the contribution of CRMP2 to the proliferation of
glioblastoma cell lines, we used a genetic knockdown strate-
gy. Using siRNAs, we knocked down CRMP2 by ~50% in all
cell lines (Fig. 3a, b). We then performed a 5-ethynyl-2′-
deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay to evaluate the con-
tribution of CRMP2 expression to glioblastoma cell prolifer-
ation (Fig. 3c). Following CRMP2 knockdown, the prolifera-
tion ratio was decreased in all three cell lines: GL15
(22.7 ± 1.55% compared to control, p < 0.0001, Mann-
Whitney test), A172 (20 ± 4% compared to control,
p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test), and U87 (39.4 ± 8.4% com-
pared to control, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). These re-
sults demonstrate an important role for CRMP2 in glioblasto-
ma proliferation.

CRMP2 Expression and Phosphorylation Control
Glioblastoma Cell Proliferation

Having demonstrated that CRMP2 levels contribute to GBM
proliferation, we next asked if CRMP2 phosphorylation could
be the event driving GBM proliferation. To answer this, we
used phospho-deficient CRMP2 constructs mutated on either
the phosphorylation site for Cdk5 (S522A) or the phosphory-
lation sites for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)
(T509A/T514A); GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of
CRMP2 occurs following the priming phosphorylation event
by Cdk5 [38]. Since the plasmids used in this study allow
expression of CRMP2 fused to a dsRed fluorescent tag to
identify the transfected cells, we were able to quantify EdU
incorporation signal in only the dsRed positive (i.e.,
transfected) cells (Fig. 4a). We found a differential contribu-
tion of CRMP2 and phospho-deficient CRMP2 to GBM cell
proliferation in the three cell lines used. CRMP2 overexpres-
sion increased the proliferation, compared to dsRed

but not of the GL15 cells (Fig. 4b). Expressing a CRMP2 that
cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk5 (S522A) decreased the
proliferation, compared to dsRed expression, of GL15
(38 ± 4.9%, p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) and A172
(55 ± 16%, p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) cells but not U87
cells (Fig. 4b). Of note here, expressing CRMP2-S522A in
U87 cells prevented the increase of proliferation observed

when wild-type CRMP2 was expressed (Fig. 4b). Finally,
when we expressed a CRMP2 that cannot be phosphorylated
by GSK3β (T509A/T514A), the proliferation, compared to
dsRed expression, was decreased only in A172 (42.6% ± 13,
p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) cells (Fig. 4b). Again, in U87
cells, expressing CRMP2 T509A/T514A prevented the in-
crease of proliferation observed when wild-type CRMP2
was expressed (Fig. 4b). No significant effect of CRMP2
T509A/T514A expression was observed in GL15 cells.

phosphorylation by Cdk5 in both central nervous system
(CNS) [27] and peripheral nervous system (PNS) [25, 26]
neurons. Prior to using this compound for functional assays,
we wanted to control its efficiency in inhibiting CRMP2 phos-
phorylation in human GBM cell lines. The cells were seeded
at 70% confluence and treated 24 h after seeding to capture
their exponential growing phase. (S)-lacosamide was applied
at 2, 20, or 200 μM overnight, and then, the cells were har-
vested and processed for Western blotting. We probed the
samples for total CRMP2 and CRMP2 phosphorylated by
Cdk5 (pS522) (Fig. 5a). The pS522 signal was quantified
and normalized to the total CRMP2 signal. We observed a
concentration-dependent inhibition of CRMP2 phosphoryla-
tion (S522) when the cells were treated with (S)-lacosamide.
These results show the efficiency of (S)-lacosamide to inhibit
CRMP2 phosphorylation (S522) in GBM cell lines. Thus, this
compound can be used to interrogate the functional conse-
quence of CRMP2 phosphorylation in glioblastoma cells.

Inhibiting CRMP2 Phosphorylation with (S)-Lacosamide
Decreases GBM Cell Proliferation

So far, our results demonstrate that GBM cell proliferation is
under the control of CRMP2 expression levels: knocking
down CRMP2 decreased the proliferation of three GBM cell
lines (Fig. 3), while overexpressing CRMP2 increased the
proliferation of A172 and U87 GBM cell lines (Fig. 4).
Also, expressing a phospho-deficient CRMP2 that cannot be
phosphorylated resulted in decreased proliferation of GL15
and A172 GBM cell lines and prevented the CRMP2-
dependent increase of proliferation in U87 cells (Fig. 4).
These results show that CRMP2 phosphorylation (S522) is a
major determinant of GBM cell proliferation. To investigate
the contribution of CRMP2 phosphorylation at S522 to cancer
cell proliferation, we used the CRMP2 phosphorylation inhib-
itor (S)-lacosamide. We seeded cells at 70% confluence and
treated 24 h after seeding to capture their exponential growing
phase. (S)-lacosamide was applied at 2, 20, or 200 μM over-
night and EdU applied during 4 h before fixation. We quanti-
fied the proliferation ratio (EdU/DAPI) of the cells treated as
described (Fig. 6a). We found that inhibiting CRMP2 phos-
phorylation with (S)-lacosamide decreased glioblastoma cell
proliferation in all GBM cell lines (Fig. 6a, b). The maximum
reduction of the proliferation ratio was achieved at a 200 μM
concentration of (S)-lacosamide, compared to the control
(0.04% DMSO) in GL15 (42.3 ± 2.47%, p < 0.001,
Kruskal-Wallis test), A172 (40.8 ± 1.88%, p < 0.001,
Kruskal-Wallis test), and U87 (22.1 ± 1.49%, p < 0.001,
Kruskal-Wallis test) cells (Fig. 6b). Thus, inhibiting CRMP2
phosphorylation using (S)-lacosamide results in a
concentration-dependent decrease of GBM cell proliferation.
In a previous study linking CRMP2 phosphorylation to
cancer progression, expressing a phospho-deficient CRMP2

GL15 and A172 cells. CRMP2 T509A/T514A expression decreased the
proliferation of A172 cells. *p < 0.05 vs. dsRed, Kruskal-Wallis test,

These results show that (i) CRMP2 expression can increase
GBM cell proliferation and (ii) CRMP2 phosphorylation at
S522 is an important phosphorylation event for CRMP2 that
drives GBM cell proliferation.

(S)-Lacosamide Inhibits CRMP2 Phosphorylation
in GBM Cell Lines

To explore further the role of CRMP2 phosphorylation at
S522 in glioblastoma, we used the CRMP2 phosphorylation
inhibitor (S)-lacosamide. (S)-lacosamide is a small molecule
that we previously identified as a specific inhibitor of CRMP2

resulted in increased apoptosis of lung cancer cells [21]. Thus,
to assess the contribution of CRMP2 phosphorylation in glio-
blastoma cell survival, we used (S)-lacosamide to inhibit
CRMP2 phosphorylation and assessed the apoptosis rate of
the GBM cells using extracellular annexin-V staining.
Annexin V is commonly used to detect apoptotic cells by its
ability to bind to phosphatidylserine, a marker of apoptosis
when it is on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. In
GL15 cells, the apoptosis rate reached 100% when the cells
were treated with 200 μM of (S)-lacosamide (Fig. 6c). The
A172 cells showed a lower basal apoptosis rate (11.7 ± 3% in
untreated cells), which increased to 80.1 ± 6.5% when the
cells were treated with 200 μM of (S)-lacosamide (Fig. 6c).
The U87 cells had the lowest increase of apoptosis between
the control treatment (39.8 ± 6.6%) and the 200 μM (S)-
lacosamide treatment (72.3 ± 7.6%) (Fig. 6c). Taken together,
these results underscore the importance of CRMP2 phosphor-
ylation at S522, as a major regulator of GBM cell proliferation
and as a negative regulator of apoptosis.

(S)-Lacosamide Inhibits Glioblastoma Growth In Vivo

We have shown that CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation
controls GBM cell proliferation in vitro. (S)-lacosamide, a
CRMP2 phosphorylation inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation
of three GBM cell lines and induced apoptosis in these cells.
(S)-lacosamide is a relatively brain-permeable compound with
a measured brain-to-plasma partition coefficient of 0.55 [39].
Thus, we next asked if (S)-lacosamide could affect GBM
growth in vivo. We used the murine GL261 in vivo GBM
model that recapitulates key features found in human tumors,

namely the invasive properties, high proliferation, active an-
giogenesis, necrosis, hypoxic zones, and impairment of the
blood-brain barrier [29, 40]. Tumors were induced in immu-
nocompetent mice by stereotaxic injection of 75,000 GL261-
LucNeo cells into the right striatum. In these cells, CRMP2 is
expressed throughout the cytoplasm, while pS522-CRMP2 is
largely restricted to the nucleus (Fig. 7a). Importantly, this cell
model allows the tumor to grow within an appropriate brain
microenvironment to better mimic human disease. Tumors
elicit detectable bioluminescence signal soon after induction
due to peroxidation of luciferin (administered 150 mg/kg, i.p.)
by luciferase expressed by the GL261-LucNeo cells, which
enables monitoring of tumor growth and response to treatment
via bioluminescent imaging. At day 7, (S)-lacosamide
(30 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) was administered daily by i.p.
injections, and the tumor growth was followed for 10 days
(Fig. 7b). After 10 days of daily treatments with (S)-
lacosamide, we observed a ~47% decrease in tumor size
(0.79 × 107 ± 0.16 × 107) relative to vehicle-treated animals
(1.7 × 107 ± 0.5 × 107); although the group sizes were rela-
tively small, these differences in tumor growth were statisti-
cally significant at day 17 (p < 0.02, Sidak’s correction for
multiple comparisons applied to a two-way repeat measure
ANOVA, n = 5 mice per group) (Fig. 7c). This suggests that
the (S)-lacosamide treatment decreased GBM growth in vivo.
To better assess the overall growth decrease resulting from
(S)-lacosamide treatment, we calculated the area under the
curve between day 10 (to allow time for (S)-lacosamide to
start being effective) and day 17. We found a decreased area
under the curve (~54%) when the animals were treated with
(S)-lacosamide (1.7 × 107 ± 0.3 × 107) compared to vehicle-

significant difference (p < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t test)
(Fig. 7d). These results provide evidence that the CRMP2
phosphorylation inhibitor (S)-lacosamide affects the growth
of GBM vivo.

The discovery reported here is important from a fundamental
scientific perspective because a knowledge gap in the pro-
oncogenic mechanism of glioblastoma is filled. It is also im-
portant from an applied perspective because glioblastoma re-
mains a significant unmet clinical need. Our study identifies
the contribution of CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation
to glioblastoma proliferation in vitro and growth in vivo, thus
introducing a novel protein contributing to glioblastoma on-
cogenic mechanisms. We found a negative correlation be-
tween CRMP2 phosphorylation and neurofibromin expres-
sion in vitro across three human GBM cell lines. We demon-
strated that GBM cell proliferation was dependent on CRMP2
expression and phosphorylation at S522. We next used the
small molecule (S)-lacosamide to inhibit CRMP2 phosphory-
lation, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in three
GBM cell lines. (S)-lacosamide was also able to decrease
orthotopic GBM growth, thus showing the importance of
CRMP2 phosphorylation for GBM proliferation in vivo.

Glioblastoma tumors have been classified, based on their
molecular signatures, into four different subtypes including
proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal [3]. In this
study, expression of CRMP2 transcripts was detected but not
linked to a particular subtype or to patient’s survival [23].
However, messenger RNA expression does not necessarily
correlate with protein expression and does not account for
CRMP2 post-translational modification status. A recent clus-
tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
(CRISPR) screen identified several novel mediators of glio-
blastoma survival outside of the commonly altered molecular
networks [41]. In this high-throughput study, deleting CRMP2
had a negative effect on the survival of the GBM cells tested
[41], in agreement with our data showing the contribution of
CRMP2 expression to GBM cell proliferation.

We recently highlighted the role that different CRMP2
post-translational modifications play in determining the cellu-
lar functions served by CRMP2 [31]. CRMP2 phosphoryla-
tion by Cdk5 was found to control CRMP2 subsequent phos-
phorylation by GSK3β [42] and addition of small ubiquitin
like modifier (SUMO) (SUMOylation) by the E2 ubiquitin-
conjugating enzyme Ubc9 [31]. Cdk5 phosphorylation of
CRMP2 is resistant to dephosphorylation [43] but can be re-
moved by decreasing the stability of the protein [44]. This
particular phosphorylation of CRMP2 has been reported to
be associated with cancer progression [18, 19]. Here, we

4412

Mol Neurobiol (2018) 55:4403–4416

extended these findings to GBM and distinctively demon-
strate a rapidly observable functional requirement of
CRMP2 phosphorylation for glioblastoma proliferation and
survival. Expressing a CRMP2-deficient for GSK3β phos-
phorylation, but not for Cdk5 phosphorylation, decreased
GBM cell proliferation in two of the cell lines tested. Thus,
we conclude that the GSK3β phosphorylation site in CRMP2
is important for glioblastoma cell proliferation. Additionally,
CRMP2 phosphorylation at S522 might serve as a hub, en-
abling novel downstream signaling pathways to regulate
CRMP2 and drive the protein into different cellular functions
such as cancer cell proliferation or chronic pain [45]. GSK3β
is a well-known mediator of glioblastoma growth [46] and
resistance to treatments [47, 48]. Our data point to CRMP2
as a possible molecular target downstream of GSK3β and thus
likely to be associated with GBM recurrence. Although
CRMP2 phosphorylation at S522 by Cdk5 has been previous-
ly reported [18], we cannot rule out the possibility that an
unknown kinase(s) may phosphorylate CRMP2 at this site
within the GBM.

The mechanism by which CRMP2 promotes cell prolifer-
ation and survival is an open question. A previous study
linked CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 to different phases
of mitosis [21]. Overexpressing CRMP2 showed a trend to-
wards a faster mitotic cycle. However, expressing a CRMP2
deficient for Cdk5 phosphorylation prevented this effect. Cells
expressing a phospho-deficient CRMP2 accumulated in the
telophase phase of mitosis [21]. This event preceding cytoki-
nesis relies on extensive microvesicle trafficking [49] and
molecule interacting with CasL 1 (MICAL1) enzymatic activ-
ity [50], two events linked to CRMP2 phosphorylation. A
separate study demonstrated CRMP2 phosphorylation by
Cdk5 to be an important mediator of ion channel trafficking
[27, 31, 51]. Thus, CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 might
be required during cytokinesis to mediate microvesicle traf-
ficking. CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK3β is
triggered by semaphorin 3A signaling [52]. However,
MICAL1 autoinhibition is released by an interaction with
CRMP proteins under semaphorin 3A stimulation [53].
These studies triangulate to link the increased CRMP2 phos-
phorylation in glioblastoma to facilitated cytokinesis through
increased microvesicle trafficking and MICAL1 enzymatic
activity. This is further supported by the finding that glioblas-
toma displays an autocrine semaphorin 3A signaling [54]
which can contribute to promoting sustained proliferation
through induction of CRMP2 phosphorylation. Another as-
pect of CRMP2 contribution to glioblastoma growth and sur-
vival could be through forward trafficking of channels and/or
receptors. We recently reported CRMP2-mediated internaliza-
tion of a sodium channel via a clathrin-dependent endocytosis
mechanism through interactions with the endocytic adaptor
Numb [31]. Numb is a protein mediating the endocytosis of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [55]. Activating

measure ANOVA). d Bar graph showing the area under the curve (AUC)

mutations (EGFR variant III) or copy number amplifications
of EGFR gene are highly incident in human glioblastoma
tumors (gene mutated in 57% of cases [2] and amplified in
84% of cases [3]). When phosphorylated by Cdk5, CRMP2
loses its interaction with Numb which results in ion channel
clathrin-mediated endocytosis defects [31]. These findings
lend support to the hypothesis that the increased CRMP2
phosphorylation at S522 in glioblastoma could further amplify
EGFR signaling leading to sustained tumor cell proliferation
and resistance.

We found CRMP2 phosphorylation levels to be inversely
correlated with neurofibromin expression level across three
GBM cell lines. Although the neurofibromin status of GL15
cells is not known, A172 and U87 cells were reported to
express neurofibromin [56]. Our results showed the role of
CRMP2 phosphorylation in glioblastoma cell proliferation,
but, interestingly, it was the neurofibromin expression level
in each cell line that defined their response to loss of CRMP2
phosphorylation. The only cell line where the expression of
phospho-deficient CRMP2 did not result in a decrease of pro-
liferation compared to the control was U87. This cell line had
the highest expression of neurofibromin and the lowest level
of CRMP2 phosphorylation. Similarly, the cell line that was
the most impacted by our manipulations of CRMP2 expres-
sion and phosphorylation was A172. This cell line had the
lowest level of neurofibromin and the highest level of phos-
phorylated CRMP2. These observations translated when we
used (S)-lacosamide and U87 cells showed a decrease of pro-
liferation only at the highest concentration of the compound.
This was linked with a less pronounced increase in apoptosis
compared to the two other cell lines. These observations show
that under neurofibromin loss, phosphorylated CRMP2 be-
comes an important determinant of glioblastoma proliferation
and survival.

CRMP2 phosphorylation by GSK3β appears to be an im-
portant determinant of glioblastoma proliferation and survival.

of GSK3β is that such inhibiting GSK3β will, in turn, activate
the Wnt signaling pathway by protecting β-catenin from

degradation. The Wnt signaling pathway promotes the main-
tenance of a cancer stem cell pool in glioblastoma, which will
contribute to tumor recurrence after treatment, leading to fu-
ture resistance [58]. In this regard, inhibiting the phosphory-
lation of GSK3β’s downstream targets, instead of the kinase

itself, may be a viable alternative strategy. We used (S)-
lacosamide to inhibit CRMP2 phosphorylation in three GBM
cell lines. This resulted in an inhibition of cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in these cells. Subjects bearing orthotopic
GBM and treated with (S)-lacosamide showed evidence for a
slowing of tumor growth compared to saline-treated controls,
thus implicating that CRMP2 phosphorylation is driving GBM
growth. This result also showed that targeting CRMP2 phos-
phorylation could be beneficial, in combination with other ther-
apeutic approaches, to treat GBM; future studies will be needed
to rigorously test this hypothesis. Because GL261 cells used in
our tumor model have been reported to contain CD133+ (can-
cer stem-like cells) and CD133− cells [59], a potential limita-
tion of our study is that cellular heterogeneity is likely to impact
the effect of (S)-LCM.

Taken together, our data introduce CRMP2 expression and
phosphorylation as important molecular events driving glio-
blastoma proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo. Our
use of (S)-lacosamide illustrates repurposing of an inactive anti-
epileptic molecule for probing of CRMP2 phosphorylation
functions in brain tumors. (S)-LCM does not impair motor
performance or elicit other observable side effects in rodents
[60]. If this molecule exhibits appropriate drug-like qualities,
like its R-isomer (Vimpat®), additional efficacy and safety
evaluation could facilitate translation of (S)-lacosamide or other
molecules targeting CRMP2 phosphorylation into new thera-
peutic strategies to treat GBM in the clinic.
