Abstract

The neurofibromatoses (neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwanno-
matosis) are rare disorders having clinical manifestations that vary greatly from patient to
patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders has made it challenging for investigators
to identify sufficient numbers of patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific
germline mutations for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because the natural
history of all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each individual, it is
difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for potential therapeutic interven-
tions. In 2012, the Children’s Tumor Foundation created a web-based patient-entered data-
base, the NF Registry, to inform patients of research opportunities for which they fit general
eligibility criteria and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll
patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated NF clinics and
conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social media. Following online
consent, demographic information and details regarding manifestations of NF were solicited
on the Registry website. Statistical analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680
registrants (the number of registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for
one of the 3 NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symp-
tom incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced data.
Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, the registry has been useful to investigators in
recruitment, particularly for observational trials, especially those for development of patient-
reported outcomes.

International neurofibromatosis registry: Contents and use

Introduction

The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF) is a 501(c)(3) medical foundation focused on
research, education, advocacy and patient support in the neurofibromatoses including neurofi-
bromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis (SCHW). The
neurofibromatoses are rare disorders with incidences of about 1 in 3000 live births for NF1,
one in 30 000 for NF2 and one in 40 000 for SCHW. Each of these conditions may lead to mul-
tiple clinical manifestations, which vary greatly from patient to patient. Each may be inherited
in an autosomal dominant pattern, or may occur de novo. Although there are many clinical tri-
als ongoing, there are currently no disease-specific FDA-approved therapies for any of the
complications of NF1, NF2 or SCHW.

The variability of manifestations in the neurofibromatoses results in difficulty in predicting
the clinical course for any given individual. Although there have been efforts to identify geno-
type-phenotype correlations, the natural histories of the disorders and the relationship to
genotypes are not fully characterized [1,2]. The rarity and variability of NF make it particularly
challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of patients with specific clinical
characteristics or germline mutations for participation in interventional studies. Finally,
because the natural history is not well characterized it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical
outcome measures for potential therapeutic interventions.

A variety of clinician-entered patient registries for NF have been previously described [3,4].
Because the clinical manifestations of the neurofibromatoses are protean, and even pathologi-
cal classification of some of the lesions is a subject of debate, it has been argued that only clini-
cian-entered data could be reliable. However, previous efforts to validate the utility of patient-
entered data in the neurofibromatoses [5] as well as the present analysis indicate that patient-
entered data can be reliable for reporting symptoms of these disorders to the extent required
for clinical trial eligibility screening.

In general, disease registries have been used to enable clinical trial recruitment, quality of
life studies, outcome studies, post-market surveillance, development of disease management
guidelines and siting of clinical trials [6]. Types of registries include population-based (such as
cancer registries), disease-specific, national health database [7] or consortium-based such as
the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Contact Registry [8], which contains 22
disease groupings representing over 200 rare diseases. Another model, disease agnostic, is
exemplified by ResearchMatch [9], a project of the Clinical Translational Science Awards
(CTSA) consortium, which allows any adult in the United States to enroll and potentially be
matched with a clinical trial.

Patient registries may be organized under a governmental agency, a commercial enterprise
such as pharmaceutical or biotech company, a private company specializing in patient recruit-
ment, a hospital, clinic or physician, a non-profit or patient advocate group (PAG), or in part-
nership between one or more of these types of entities [7].

Numerous patient advocacy groups (PAGs) have established registries on their own initia-
tive in order to further research in a specific condition. Such databases have the advantage of
drawing on patient input in order to focus registry questions on what is important to them
[10].

In 2012, CTF initiated recruitment to a web-based patient-entered registry (www.

nfregistry.org) [11] to inform patients of research opportunities and to connect patients with
investigators interested in recruitment to approved trials, regardless of institutional affiliation.
Utilization of the registry for recruitment to observational, survey and interventional trials
began in 2013.

International neurofibromatosis registry: Contents and use

In the present analyses, we compare features of patients in this self-reported registry with

those of other patient- and clinician-reported NF registries and document its use as a resource
for investigators.

Methods
Organization and recruitment to the registry

The registry questionnaires [S1 Text] and consent language [S2 Text] were developed in col-
laboration with two clinicians who are co-authors of this paper (BK, DV). The questionnaires
were piloted in 50 patients and minor modifications were made. The NF registry protocol and
informed consent were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board on April 16,
2012. It is Study Number 1131422, WIRB Protocol Number 20120455. All WIRB-approved
research is required to be conducted research in accordance with the protocol, applicable laws
and regulations, and the principles of research ethics as set forth in the Belmont Report. All
participants or their parent/legal guardians provided online informed consent prior to enter-
ing any data in the database.

Recruitment took place through the CTF website, NF-related Facebook groups, at the

annual CTF Patient Forum, through NF clinics and the CTF volunteer network, and through
word of mouth and social media.

All registrants were required to supply name, sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, mailing

address, phone number and email address. The purpose of collecting race and ethnicity data
was to fulfill Western Institutional Review Board reporting requirements, and to identify gaps
in recruitment of specific groups. All registrants completed a demographics and family history
section. Depending on the type of NF reported, they were directed to a specific questionnaire
for NF1, NF2 or SCHW. Disease-specific questionnaires captured features of current pub-
lished diagnostic criteria [12,13,14] and a variety of disease manifestations. They also posed
quality of life questions. Participants were offered options with regard to being contacted by
registry coordinators, including no contact.

For purposes of the present analyses, studies that have recruited through the Registry are

classified as either observational; survey (i.e., patient-reported outcomes or quality of life); or
interventional. Interventional studies are divided into psycho-social interventions and drug/
device interventions. Data are available regarding how many registrants opened e-mails invit-
ing them to participate in a study; however, data regarding the proportion that contacted the
investigator, were screened or actually enrolled are not available.

Information collected. The criteria for diagnosis of NF1 were published by an NIH con-
sensus development conference in 1988 [12]. The criteria for diagnosis of NF2 are the modi-
fied NIH consensus criteria as described by Evans in 2009 [13]. The criteria for diagnosis of
SCHW are those detailed by Plotkin et al. in 2011 [14]. These criteria were used to create cura-
tion guidelines used by the Registry host (once known as PatientCrossroads, rebranded as
AltaVoice, and recently acquired by and known as Invitae [15] to assign categories of “Criteria
Met” or “Criteria Not Met” to each participant account. Participants were invited to upload
copies of their genetic testing results to their profiles. In addition to soliciting information
related to confirmation of their diagnoses, the presence and age at onset of other probably or
possibly NF-related symptoms were collected. Registrants were also asked to identify their key
concerns related to their disorder.

Registry platform

Data storage, security and confidentiality. A state-of-the-art web-based, patient opt-in
registry (maintained by Invitae) [15] was used for data capture. Patients or parent/guardians

of minor patients provided answers to a disease-specific questionnaire via a secure web portal.
The registry website could be accessed on mobile devices but was not optimized for them.
Although the current questionnaires are currently available only in English, translation of the
registry into multiple languages is planned.

HIPAA privacy security rules are enforced by policies and procedures that protect the con-
fidentiality and security of protected health information. The database design is such that par-
ticipant identifying information is stored in data tables separate from participant medical
information.

Access to patient identifying information is restricted to authorized personnel at CTF and
Invitae. Additional database security features of this registry target multiple levels, including
data element (e.g., restricted access to fields), user (e.g., password authentication access), appli-
cation (e.g., role-based access to features, access audit trails) and hosting services (e.g., firewall,
secure sockets layer).

Invitae uses MySQL Server as the back-end relational database. All server requests are

transmitted over SSL and use several layers of data and access protection, with a dedicated,
managed Cisco router firewall and a redundant array of independent disks to ensure data
recovery if a hard drive fails between backups. Back up (system-level and database-level) per-
formed nightly is retained for 30 days with monthly backups stored for 1 year at the data
center.

Approval and execution of requests for use.

Information on applying for access to de-
identified data or for trial recruitment is available on the NF Registry website [16]. Requests
for registry use are reviewed by the CTF Clinical Program Director and by the Data Access
Committee, a group comprised of NF experts and NF patients and family members. All studies
and recruitments must be approved by the investigator’s Institutional Review Board. Only de-
identified data can be shared by CTF with investigators.

Following approval by the Data Access Committee, The CTF Clinical Program Director

extracts from the database a list of registrants reporting the manifestation(s) of NF specific to
the study and any other specified characteristics such as age range or geographic location.
Search results are used to generate an email list of potentially eligible participants, who receive
an email from sent from the Invitae platform. The text provides a lay-level description of the
study and the investigator’s contact information. The email advises the recipient to contact his
or her healthcare provider to ask whether the study may be suitable for them. The registrant
may initiate contact with the investigator to explore study participation.

Curation and quality control. Data curation was carried out by Invitae according to
guidelines set by CTF based on current diagnostic criteria [12,13,14]. Each registrant was
assigned a status of “Criteria Met” or “Criteria Not Met” according to disease-specific criteria.
Participants with NF2 and SCHW were additionally asked “Have you been diagnosed with
[disorder] by a doctor” or, in the case of NF2, whether an NF2 mutation had been identified by
molecular testing. (In the case of NF1, genetic testing was not required for “Criteria Met” sta-
tus because NF1 is most often diagnosed by clinical signs.) Curation also entailed querying
registrants by email or telephone for incomplete or incorrect data such as implausible or
impossible birthdates. Periodically, all registrants were sent email reminders to update their
information.

Methods for statistical analysis

A dataset for the present analysis was frozen as of October, 9, 2015 by extracting data from all
accounts assigned a post-curation status of “Criteria Met” to Excel spreadsheets [S3 Table]
using the reporting modules built into the registry. The spreadsheets were converted to text

files (comma-separated) and imported into the R Statistical Environment V 3.2.4 [17]. Tabula-
tions were performed using the stat.table function of the Epi package [18]. Statistical analyses
were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed rank tests (for continuous vari-
ables) and ordered categorical variables and the Chi-Square Test (for unordered categorical
variables). In comparing more than 2 categories, the approach was to first perform an omnibus
test of the entire set; if that test was significant then the categories were tested pairwise against
each other. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and p values were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Unless otherwise specified, when participants entered or updated their data in multiple ses-

sions over time, the data used for analysis was the most recent data entered.

Results
Results across disorders

To validate or de-validate the hypothesis that the registry data would be valuable, a rigorous
statistical analysis was carried out on a subset of 4680 participants who met data curation crite-
ria based on current practice [12,13,14] for their disorder. This dataset contained records from
the inception of the registry on June 10, 2012, to October 9, 2015. The 4680 participants had
completed 6504 survey sessions. A single session was obtained for 3401 individuals and 1279
completed more than one session. In 50% of cases the registration was a self-report and in
47.4% of cases the report was made by a parent or guardian.

Participants who updated their surveys generally did so in response to a yearly reminder

email, based on the observation that, overall, 74% of 1279 sessions subsequent to the first were
made within 30 days of receiving a reminder. The strength of this association decreased with
increasing numbers of sessions. Thus, 79% of second sessions, 69% of third sessions, 61% of
4th sessions and 36% of 5th sessions were made within 30 days of a reminder. Of those with
one or more updating sessions, the median follow-up time (time between updates) was 402.35
days.

Sex. Table 1 shows enrollment by sex and type of NF. NF1 patients represented 86%, NF2

represented 12% and SCHW represented 2%. For each type, females were a majority of the
registrants (56.2, 59.8, and 59.3% respectively).

Age. The age of registrants at the time of registration ranged from < 1 year to 77 years.

Among registrants with NF1 or NF2, females were significantly older than males (for NF1
median age 26.3 and 20.0 years respectively, Wilcoxon test p < 0.001, for NF2 median age 35.9
versus 30.0 years, p < 0.001). Among those with SCHW, the female and male proportions
(median ages 43.6 and 46.7 years) did not differ significantly.

Registrants were asked to designate, if known, their age of diagnosis in one of 5 age groups.

Their responses are shown in Table 2. 66.5% of registrants with NF1 were diagnosed before
the age of 5, while 76.5% with NF2 were diagnosed after the age of 10 and 90.1% those with
SCHW after the age of 20. Differences among the median age at diagnosis were highly

significant (p < 0.001 for Kruskal-Wallis test among all 3 groups and Wilcoxon rank-sum test
for subsequent pairwise comparisons among all pairs of disorders).

The cohort as a whole is biased toward pediatric patients. This is especially true for NF1,

with 48% of NF 1 registrants under age 18. The other 2 disorders are less biased toward pediat-
ric cases in the Registry, with 16% of NF2 patients and 1% of SCHW under 18.

Family history. At least 1 affected family member was reported by 41.9% of NF1 regis-

trants, but only 25.2% of NF2 and 23.5% of SCHW registrants. Overall, 39.6% of the registrants
had at least one other affected family member. 47.5% of registrants denied knowing of any
other affected family member. The remainder was uncertain of their family history.

The majority (77.9%) of registrants was white, 5% were African-American and 4.1% were

Asian. (Table 3).

The large majority, 86.8% of registrants, was from North America. 6.5% were from Europe
while 3.0% were from Australia, New Zealand or a Pacific island. The geographic distributions
were similar for the three disorders (Table 4). Among the 306 Europeans in the registry 281
(91.8%) were from countries in the European Union.

U.S. registrants in comparison with U.S. Census data. Of the 4680 registrants in this

report, 3904 (83.4%) were from the United States. In Table 5, we compare selected characteris-
tics with current estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau [19]. The proportion of female regis-
trants was higher than that in the U.S. population for all disorders, and was statistically
significantly higher for those with NF1 and NF2. A similar result was seen among U.S. whites.
U.S. African-Americans were less common among registrants than in U.S. Census estimates
and the difference was statistically significant for all 3 types of NF. Although few in numbers,
Native Americans were more frequent in the registry than in the Census estimates and the dif-
ferences were statistically significant for NF1 and for SCHW.

Specific symptomatologies

Neurofibromatosis type 1. The most commonly reported manifestations of the 4020

registrants with NF1 (Table 6) were cutaneous neurofibromas (65.8% of registrants), learning
disabilities (50.1%), Lisch nodules (45.3%), NF1-related pain (42.8%) and plexiform neurofi-
bromas (34.5%). Of the 2645 with at least 1 cutaneous neurofibroma 956 (36.1%) had between
1 and 10, 920 (34.7%) between 11 and 100 and 769 (29.1%) more than 100.

Some form of learning disability was identified by 60.3% of registrants and 6.4% of this

group specifically identified that disability as Attention Deficit Disorder.

Bone fractures were not rare. Although of 4020 registrants with NF1, 2935 (76.1%) denied a
history of fractures, at least 1 fracture was reported by 922 (23.9%) of them. 39 registrants indi-
cated they had suffered more than 5 fractures and 163 reported they were unsure if they had
had a bone fracture.

1052 of the female registrants identified themselves as being of childbearing age at the last

date of contact with the registry, and 489 (46.5%) reported that they had been pregnant at least
once.

A comparison of NF1 symptom incidences in the patient-entered NF Registry with those
reported in the literature is shown in Table 7. The cited published studies all used cross-sec-
tional data. One of the studies was longitudinal but used cross-sectional data.

Neurofibromatosis type 2. The most common manifestations identified by the 579 NF2

registrants (Table 8) included difficulties with balance (81.3%), vestibular schwannomas
(79.6%), tinnitus (74.8%), hearing loss (73.4%) and NF2-related pain (67.5%).

There were also a variety of other reported tumors including 303 (52.3%) meningiomas,

97 (16.8%) ependymomas, 293 (50.6%) spinal schwannomas, 156 (26.9%) neurofibromas,
23 (4.0%) optic gliomas and 72 (12.4%) otherwise unspecified neural tumors.

Hearing loss of some degree was reported by 411 of the NF2 registrants, of whom 72 (17.5%)
indicated mild, 67 (16.3%) moderate and 58 (14.1%) severe loss. 214 (52.1%) indicated that they
were deaf.

Juvenile cataracts were reported by 93 (16.1%) of 402 NF2 registrants who responded to

this question. Among this group, 64 (68.8%) reported unilateral cataracts. Visual loss of some
degree was reported by 389 (67.2%) of NF2 registrants, of whom 154 (39.6%) indicated mild,
162 (41.9%) moderate and 61 (15.7%) severe loss. 12 indicated that they were blind.

329 (57.5%) of 579 registrants with NF2 reported at least mild facial weakness and 77

(13.3%) considered it severe. Women were more likely to complain of facial weakness (60.1%
of 346 women versus 51.9% of 233 men), but the difference fell just short of statistical signifi-
cance (Chi-Square = 3.47, df = 1, p = 0.06).

International neurofibromatosis registry: Contents and use

When asked the nature of the NF2-related problem that the registrant considered major,

hearing difficulty was by far the most commonly indicated (33% of the 579), followed by
tumor burden (13.6%), dizziness (12.3%) and pain (11.9%).

Schwannomatosis. 81 registrants indicated they had a diagnosis of SCHW and 72 of them

indicated that a health care practitioner had confirmed the diagnosis. Of the 81 reporting a
diagnosis of SCHW, 67 reported that a brain MRI was performed to check for the presence of
vestibular schwannomas. 2 reported unilateral and 1 registrant reported bilateral vestibular
schwannomas. For registrants with SCHW, multiple tumors, including meningiomas, ependy-
momas, and non-vestibular schwannomas, were the rule. Only 3 of the 81 indicated that they
had only a single tumor.

11 reported that they had tested positive for a mutation in either INI1/SMARCB1/SNF5 or

LZTR1. 9 reported being tested without the finding of a known mutation in any of these genes.
71 (87.7%) of 81 SCHW registrants noted pain they ascribed to their disease. For 38 (47%)

the pain was described as severe and for 13 (18.3%) as unmanageable.

Research usage of the database

Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, 18 studies recruited subjects through the CTF Regis-
try (Table 9). Of these, 12 were observational and 6 interventional. The observational studies
involved focus groups for survey development and surveys regarding quality of life issues for
patients and family members of patients with NF. The interventional studies included two
Phase II drug trials and one radiotherapy trial. Some studies recruited subjects with all 3 of the
neurofibromatoses and others sought subjects with specific disorders such as plexiform neuro-
fibroma, MPNST, tibial bowing in NF1 or breast cancer in NF1. All interventional studies
were performed in the US. One observational study was conducted in the UK.

The median proportion of potentially eligible subjects who opened the recruitment emails

was 35.5% (mean 38.2, range 27–66%). In contrast, 2 bulk mailing services [26, 27] both report
an average opening rate of 22% for health-related mass emailings. There were no clear differ-
ences in the proportions of subjects who opened emails regarding observational or interven-
tional studies. Anecdotally, investigators have reported that they are pleased with the results of
recruitment through the registry but there are no data regarding what proportion of registry
subjects who opened emails actually contacted investigators, were screened or were enrolled in
the studies.

Clinical trial participation

Registrants were asked whether they had participated in a clinical trial for their condition. Of
the cohort of 4680 in the main analysis (registered before October 9, 2015) 165 people with
NF1 (4.1%) and 102 people with NF2 (18.8%) reported having been enrolled in a clinical trial.
SCHW patients were asked if they wanted to be contacted by the International Schwannoma-
tosis Database [28], a clinician-entered database, and 78 of these patients answered yes.

Discussion

Disease registries have been used to support clinical research since at least the 1940s [29]. They
may take the form of national health databases, contact registries [7], consortium-based, such
as the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research’s Rare Disease Clinical Research Network
(RDCRN) Contact Registry [8], or disease agnostic, such as the Clinical Translational Science
Awards (CTSA) consortium’s ResearchMatch [9].

In addition to their functions in clinical trial recruitment, quality of life studies, outcome

studies, post-market surveillance, development of disease management guidelines and recruit-
ment for and siting of clinical trials [6] they may be used to explore disease incidence, comor-
bidities and mortality, or for data-mining and hypothesis generation [29].

As a patient advocate organization, CTF’s aim in creating the NF Registry was to facilitate

treatment and treatment-enabling research in this neglected disease area by developing a pool
of recruitable patients. We saw a need for broad geographic reach to accumulate subgroups of
patients with specific manifestations that could be targeted for clinical trials for NF, and to
give all stakeholders (industry, academia, government) the ability to assess the distribution of
the different manifestations of all forms of NF. Maintaining a patient-entered contact registry
was seen by the Foundation as a way to promote treatment development in NF by de-risking
the critical task of completing trial enrollment, which is especially difficult in rare disease [7].
In electing to create a patient-entered contact registry for NF, the Foundation’s aim was to
strike a balance between the costly and time-intensive approach of compiling clinician-entered
data and the urgent need to speed treatment development via a large and expanding database
of patients unimpeded by geographic or institutional boundaries.

The CTF Registry has been successful in enrolling large numbers of NF1 subjects and

smaller numbers with NF2 or SCHW. Most participants reside in the US. Recruitment
through US-based NF clinics and meetings may account for this predominance. When com-
pared to U.S. Census data [19], registrants were more likely to be female and white than the
population as a whole. The fact that the website was available in English only may have
reduced enrollment of non-English speakers both in the U.S. and abroad.

The dominance of pediatric patients in the cohort is likely due to the fact that NF1 is usually

diagnosed at young ages due to pathognomic features that begin to appear at or shortly after
birth while NF2 and SCHW are generally diagnosed in adolescents and adults. Nonetheless,
the need for more adult registrants will be addressed in future recruitment efforts.

The CTF Registry is currently the largest reported NF1 cohort in the literature and the only
one that was designed to be available generally to interested investigators. In general, the mani-
festations reported by CTF registrants with NF1 occurred at rates within the range reported by
other sources. However, virtually all registries have some biases based on the nature of their
respective recruitments. Registries that are limited to children are likely to have fewer regis-
trants with the types of manifestations that become more prevalent with age, and registries
that are hospital- or clinic-based may be biased toward subjects with more severe manifesta-
tions of the disorder.

For cutaneous neurofibromas, the overall prevalence reported in the registry was only

65.8%; however, stratifying respondents by age showed a more expected higher prevalence. By
age 30, 81.8% reported cutaneous neurofibromas, by age 40, 95.7%, and by age 50, 98.2. NF2 is
often not diagnosed until adulthood, which is consistent with our finding that 76% of regis-
trants were diagnosed after age 10. Evans et al. [30] reported the presenting symptoms in 120
patients with NF2. They found unilateral or bilateral hearing loss in 44% and balance dysfunc-
tion in 8%. The rates of these problems may have been higher in the CTF registrants who were
older and had developed more disease manifestations over time.

We are aware of the limitations of the current data set. Namely, patients may not know,

may mistake, or may fail to recall the details of some of the information asked in the surveys.
However, when we compared the frequencies of the various manifestations of NF1 in clini-
cian-reported studies to the frequencies extracted from the NF Registry, we observed that in
most instances the frequencies match very closely [Table 7]. We therefore feel confident that
the registry data is of sufficient quality to be used for clinical trial recruitment.

Moreover, it is the responsibility of the investigator of the individual trial to confirm that

the patient meets entry requirements. We do have the ability to re-contact and re-consent par-
ticipants to develop further this cohort in the future, and are open to expanding registry capa-
bilities uses to include, for example, outcomes studies and natural history studies.

The Foundation is, however, committed to ongoing monitoring of the registry entries to

continuously improve the quality of our patient-entered data. Following the present analysis,
we improved the disease surveys to clarify items that appeared to be prone to misunderstand-
ing. We added a glossary and photographs of some of the major manifestations. In addition,
the Foundation is investing resources in patient engagement to ensure that NF patients are
fully educated about their manifestations. In light of the positive effect of reminder emails
shown by the proximity of updates to reminder emails (see Results), we are increasing the fre-
quency of these emails to at least every 6 months instead of yearly.

A particularity of NF is that as a lifelong condition that may not be at all obvious to casual
observers, and some patients and affected families may wish to keep their NF status confiden-
tial for fear of stigma, employment discrimination, or insurance limitations affecting their
well-being. Anecdotally we have found some resistance to online disease registrations due to
concerns over internet privacy. As a patient advocacy organization, CTF works to overcome
this reluctance by explaining privacy and security measures in place, building a sense of com-
munity and making the case for patient partnership in research. We present the registry at sci-
entific and lay-oriented events; use CTF’s volunteer network to campaign on a local level
about the importance of registering and updating; promote via NF-related Facebook pages
and CTF newsletters; explore IRB-approved small financial incentives; and create patient
engagement programs.

Thus far, the database has been useful to investigators in recruitment for observational tri-
als, particularly for development of patient-reported outcomes for future use in clinical trials.
There have been limited interventional trials available, particularly for NF1. Recruitment to tri-
als may be geographically limited, making them unavailable to many registrants. This is

reflected in the very small numbers of NF1 registrants who had participated in trials in this
analysis.

It is anticipated that the number of clinical trials for these disorders will grow and the NF

Registry will be of increasing value as both the number of registrants and the number of trials
expand.

Conclusions

The CTF-sponsored NF Registry is the largest reported NF database to date and continues to
grow. As of December 27, 2016, it contains 7371 registrants from 71 countries. It is expected to
continue to grow in number of participants and to continue to be supported by CTF funding
and personnel for at least 5 years and likely longer. Though it does not contain clinician-
entered data, it has the advantages of worldwide reach and access to patients who otherwise
might be missed because they do not see a specialist for NF care. These factors make it valuable
as a contact registry.

The aim of the statistical analyses of the dataset was validating or de-validating the hypothe-

sis that patient-entered data about symptoms approximates the patterns seen in clinician-
entered data, and that the NF Registry can therefore be dependably used for initiating patient
recruitment for clinical trials.

Thus far, the database has been useful to investigators for recruitment of mainly observa-

tional trials, particularly those for development of patient-reported outcomes for future use in
clinical trials.

From the analyses, we postulate that although self-reported, the incidences of NF manifesta-

tions in registrants are broadly comparable to what has been reported in clinician-reported
databases. To date, the database has supported geographically diverse recruitment for 14
observational and 4 interventional trials. Examining the association between time of update
reminder email with time of updating suggests that participants should be contacted more fre-
quently with requests to update their information. Translation of the questionnaires to addi-
tional languages and active recruitment of underrepresented populations may make the
registry data more representative of the U.S. NF population, broaden its utility internationally
and increase the usefulness of the database to investigators. Patients are clamoring for more
interventional studies and availability of additional studies will likely aid in expanding
registration.
