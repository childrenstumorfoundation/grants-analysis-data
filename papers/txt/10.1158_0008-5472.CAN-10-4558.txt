Abstract

Plexiform neurofibromas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors initiated by biallelic mutation of the NF1 tumor
suppressor gene in the Schwann cell lineage. To understand whether neurofibroma formation is possible after
birth, we induced Nf1 loss of function with an inducible proteolipid protein Cre allele. Perinatal loss of Nf1
resulted in the development of small plexiform neurofibromas late in life, whereas loss in adulthood caused large
plexiform neurofibromas and morbidity beginning 4 months after onset of Nf1 loss. A conditional EGFP reporter
allele identified cells showing recombination, including peripheral ganglia satellite cells, peripheral nerve
S100bþ myelinating Schwann cells, and peripheral nerve p75þ cells. Neurofibromas contained cells with Remak
bundle disruption but no recombination within GFAPþ nonmyelinating Schwann cells. Extramedullary lympho-
hematopoietic expansion was also observed in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice. These tumors contained EGFPþ/Sca-1þ
stromal cells among EGFP-negative lympho-hematopoietic cells indicating a noncell autonomous effect and
unveiling a role of Nf1-deleted microenvironment on lympho-hematopoietic proliferation in vivo. Together these
findings define a tumor suppressor role for Nf1 in the adult and narrow the range of potential neurofibroma-
initiating cell populations. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4675–85. Ó2011 AACR.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant
inherited disease, affecting approximately 1:3000 individuals
worldwide (1). Disease manifestations are observed after
mutation or loss of NF1 in diverse cells and tissues. Common
findings include learning and memory difficulties, and optic
pathway gliomas (2–3). Rarer manifestations include juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (4–6), a myelodysplastic/
myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by monocytosis,
lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Most NF1 patients (>90%) develop tumors within the
peripheral ganglia, peripheral, and/or cranial nerves called
neurofibromas, composed of cell types including neuronal
axons, fibroblasts, perineurial cells, Schwann cells, and mast
cells (7). Homozygous loss of NF1 is present only within the
Schwann cell compartment (8–10) indicating that cells within
the Schwann cell
lineage are necessary for neurofibroma

formation. In humans, plexiform neurofibromas can be con-
genital, suggesting a possible role for a developing Schwann
cell in neurofibroma formation. However, the cell(s) of origin
for neurofibroma formation within the Schwann cell lineage
remain unclear.

Neural crest cells develop into Schwann cell precursors
between E11 and E13 in mouse sciatic nerve, and Schwann
cells by E18 (11–12). Progenitors identified after the establish-
ment of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have more limited self-
renewal and differentiation potential than neural crest stem
cells (13–17). Schwann cells differentiate in close association
with the axons of peripheral nerves. Those Schwann cells
associated with neuronal cell bodies form satellite cells that
express either S100b or GFAP. Schwann cells ensheathing
multiple small axons in peripheral nerves are GFAPþ non-
myelinating Schwann cells, whereas Schwann cells associating
with single large axons form myelin and express S100b and
periaxin (18). Neurofibroma initiating cells may be committed
glial cells, de-differentiated Schwann cells, and/or post-crest
progenitor cells.
Nf1 /  mouse embryos die by E13.5 due to abnormal heart
development and Nf1þ/  mice do not develop neurofibromas
(19–20). Loss of Nf1 in animal models using neural crest
drivers Wnt1-Cre (E9.5), Mpz–Cre (E9.5–10.5), and Pax3–Cre
(E10.5) did not result in neurofibroma formation (21). These
findings suggested that a post-crest target cell(s) drives neu-
rofibroma formation; therefore, several laboratories targeted
Nf1 loss to Schwann cell populations after neural crest migra-
tion. In a pioneering study a Krox20–Cre driver line, which
expresses within boundary cap cells at E10.5 and later
in Schwann cells in peripheral nerves, caused genetically

engineered mice (GEM) neurofibroma formation (22). A
P0A-Creþ driver line in which loss of Nf1 begins in neural
crest at E9.5 with robust expression at E12.5 also enabled
neurofibroma formation (23). Loss of Nf1 in embryonic
Schwann cells (E12.5) also caused neurofibroma formation
(24). Thus cell(s) developing at or after the embryonic Schwann
cell stage of development initiate neurofibroma formation.

Peripheral nerve Remak bundles containing small diameter
axons ensheathed by a single Schwann cell are disrupted in all
neurofibroma models. In contrast, myelinated axons appear
relatively spared. This led to the suggestion that nonmyelinat-
ing Schwann cell are tumor-initiating cells within neurofibro-
mas (23).

Myelin proteolipid protein (Plp) is a component of the
Schwann cell myelin sheath (25). We used a tamoxifen-indu-
cible PlpCre driver line [Plp-Cre-ERT (designated PlpCre
throughout)] to test the potential role of Nf1 loss within
Plp-expressing cells in neurofibroma formation (26), inducing
Nf1 loss after birth or in adult animals. We report that Nf1
inactivation at either age results in neurofibroma formation.
While Remak bundle disruption is shown within the neurofi-
bromas, GFAPþ nonmyelinating Schwann cells do not show
Nf1 inactivation.

Materials and Methods

Mouse husbandry

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation animal
care and use committee approved all animal use. Mice were
housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium
on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with free access to food and
water.

Mouse strains

Nf1 flox/þ mice on a mixed 129/Bl/6 background (22) were
mated to female tamoxifen-inducible PlpCre C57Bl6 mice (26).
PlpCre;Nf1fl/þ mice were bred to mice containing a CMV-b
actin loxP flanked CAT gene upstream of the enhanced green
fluorescent protein cassette (27).

Perinatal tamoxifen injections

Tamoxifen (100 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol and
9 mls of sunflower seed oil. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) tamoxifen
injection (1 mg/100 mL) was twice a day for 3 consecutive
days to lactating mothers, administering tamoxifen to pups
through the mother's milk, beginning when pups were 1 day
old. Dose-limiting toxicity was pup trembling and occa-
sional mortality, when tamoxifen was provided twice a
day for >3 days. Tamoxifen injection once daily for 3 or
5 days to the mother failed to cause peripheral nerve
recombination.

Adult tamoxifen injections

One hundred microliters (1 mg/100 mL) was administered
i.p. once-or-twice-a-day for 3 consecutive days. Tamoxifen
administration once daily for 3 or 5 consecutive days did
not result in significant adult peripheral nerve recombination.
We dosed twice a day for 3 consecutive days.

Genotyping and recombination and survival studies

Mice were genotyped by PCR (22, 26, 27). Nf1 recombination
was determined 30 days after tamoxifen injections using PCR
(22). PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice were euthanized when they became
paralyzed, failed to groom, had obvious weight loss, or devel-
oped tumor masses.

Tissue processing

We administered Brdu i.p. (50 mg/kg body weight) 3 times
at 2-hour intervals. Two hours later, we anesthetized mice
and perfused with ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues
were removed and photographed on a Leica MZFL111
microscope, then post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde over-
night for paraffin sectioning or for an hour with transfer to
20% sucrose for frozen sectioning. For electron microscopy,
we perfused mice with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5%
glutaradehyde, post-fixed in the same fixative overnight,
and then transferred tissues to 0.175 mol/L cacodylate
buffer, osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in Embed
812 (Ladd Research Industries). Ultrathin sections were
stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on
a Hitachi Model H-7600 microscope.

Histology

Paraffin sections were processed for H&E to examine tissue
structure or stained with Toludine Blue to identify mast cells.
An in vitro Brdu staining kit monitored proliferation (Invitro-
gen). Biotinylated secondary antibodies were used at 1:200
(Vector), together with an ABC kit to visualize immunoreac-
tivity (Vector Labs).

Antibodies

Cryostat sections were air dried and processed for immu-
nohistochemistry using markers for EGFP (chicken GFP
1:2000; Millipore), myelinating Schwann cells [rabbit S100b
1:25,000 for fluorescence and 1:30,000 for 3,3
diaminobenzi-
dine (DAB); DAKO], nonmyelinating Schwann cells (rabbit
GFAP 1:500; DAKO), Schwann cells with glutathione synthase
(rabbit GS 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotech), mesenchymal cells
(Sca-1 1:200; clone D7, BD-Pharmingen). Fluorescent second-
ary antibodies were used at 1:200 (Jackson Immuno Labs)
except for Alexa 594 at 1:800 (rabbit or mouse; Invitrogen).
Histomount or Fluoromount G was used to coverslip DAB or
fluorescent sections, respectively. Fluorescent images were
captured on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope using a 40
Plan-NEO FLUAR objective, Hamumamatsu Orca ER camera,
and ImageJ software.

Complete blood counts and flow cytometry analysis

Peripheral blood counts were carried out in a Hemavet
counter (Drew Scientific). Blood smears were stained with
Diff-Quick for manual counts. Flow cytometry analysis used
CD45R/B-220 (clone RA3–6B2)-Pacific Blue, CD3e (clone 145–
2C11)-PerCP-Cy5.5, Mac-1 (CD11b, clone M1/70)-PE, Gr-1/
Ly6C-G (RB6–8C5)-APC-Cy7 and CD117 (ACK45)-APC (Bec-
ton Dickinson) and analyzed for coexpression of EGFP on an
alive gate selected based on light scatter parameters in a FACS
Canto flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Statistical analyses

Kaplan–Meier survival curves were created using GraphPad
Prism software and Log-rank Mantel–Cox Tests. Counting of
Schwann cells and satellite cells was carried out on at least
150–300 EGFPþ cells per area per animal from 3–5 animals
per genotype. Two-way t-tests were carried out on complete
blood count (CBC) X Blood Smear counts and immuno-
reactive cell counts with a significance cutoff of P < 0.05.

Results

Postnatal (P1–3) loss of Nf1 in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice
causes early and later mortality

To test whether loss of Nf1 within postnatal cells elicits
tumors in vivo, we chose a tamoxifen-inducible PlpCre driver.
Survival was monitored after postnatal (1–3) tamoxifen expo-
sure within PlpCre mice and showed two phases of mortality
(Fig. 1A; P < 0.0001). Seven of 36 PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals died
when they were 5–7 months old, displaying hematopoietic
lesions characteristic of lymphoma (7/36 ¼ 20%; Supplemen-
tary Table S1). No neurofibroma formation was observed upon
gross dissection of these 7 mice.

The remaining PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals (29/36; 80%) required
sacrifice between 15 and 21 months of age. Littermate PlpCre;
Nf1wt controls (designated "WT controls" or wild type
throughout the manuscript) remained healthy. On gross dis-
section these PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals had enlarged peripheral
nerves associated with paraspinal tumors at cervical (Fig. 1B)
and thoracic spinal levels. Sixty-seven percent (4 of 6) of mice

Neurofibroma Formation in Adult Mice

in which full neuroaxis dissection was carried out also had
paraspinal tumors within the lumbar/sacral regions (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Grading and classification of tumors used
GEM nerve sheath classification (28). GEM neurofibromas
Grade I are defined as tumors with histological features
similar to those of human neurofibromas; hypocellular with
abundant matrix and collagen fibers, minimal cell atypia and
rare mitosis. There are often intermixed nerve axons and mast
cells present. All paraspinal tumors in the PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl model
were GEM Grade I neurofibromas. On histological analysis,
they showed low cellularity, stromal matrix between the cells,
S100bþ myelinating Schwann cells, and mast cell infiltration
(Fig. 1C).

Peripheral nerve sheath tumor formation after
perinatal or adult tamoxifen exposure in PLPCre;Nf1fl/fl
mice

One in 5 PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice developed GEM Grade III
peripheral nerve sheath tumor
(PNST; Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar to human
malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor (MPNST), GEM
Grade III PNST are densely cellular tumors with marked
anaplasia, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and frequent
mitoses (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C, right). Tumors arose in
the abdomen, at the base of the tail, or in hindlimbs after
either perinatal or adult loss of Nf1. Clear relationships to
lower grade neurofibroma and/or proximity to S100þ cells
enabled classification as GEM PNST (Supplementary Fig. S1A,
right insert).

Perinatal tamoxifen exposure in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice
causes reactive hyperplasia of hematopoietic cells

Endogenous Plp is expressed in spleen and thymus as well
as glial cells (29). Therefore, this PlpCre driver could be
expressed within hematopoietic cell populations. Postnatal
(P1–3) tamoxifen injections within PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals
caused development of tumors resulting from extramedul-
lary expansion of lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in
36% of the animals examined. Seven developed early (by 5 to
7 months of age) and 7 animals contained hematopoietic-
containing tumors at necropsy in the context of complica-

tions arisen from neurofibroma formation (15 to 22 months
of age). Enlarged organs with solid white lesions were noted
within the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, lacrimal gland, and
lymph nodes within the abdominal cavity, neck, inguinal,
and axillary regions (Fig. 2A). Within the subset of animals
that developed these tumors, splenomegaly, a prominent
finding in a number of hematopoietic abnormalities includ-
ing JMML, was common (Fig. 2A, right). These animals often
suffered dermatitis of the face and neck. While eczema is
common in JMML, these dermal lesions overlaid neurofi-
bromas deep within the tissue.

Neurofibroma Formation in Adult Mice

To characterize the hematopoietic lineage within these
tumors, flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes or abdominal
masses from PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl;EGFPþ mice was carried out.
Tumors were composed of a heterogeneous hematopoietic
cell population (B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells), which were
EGFP negative (Fig. 2B). We examined the peripheral blood of
wild type and PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals at 7 months of age. Total
CBC and Blood Smear Counts showed an increase in poly-
morphic mononuclear cells (PMN; P ¼ 0.0026) and lympho-
cytes (LY; P ¼ 0.0006), with a decrease in monocytes (MO; P ¼
0.0347) in PLPCre;Nf1fl/fl animals compared with age-matched
littermate controls (Fig. 2C).
Histological analysis of tumor sections revealed the pre-
sence of EGFPþ cells morphologically distinct from the
lympho-myeloid infiltrate (Fig. 2D). EGFPþ cells were spindle
shaped, infiltrated the lymphohematopoietic tissue and some
EGFPþ cells expressed Sca-1, a recognized marker of
mesenchymal cells and progenitors with hematopoietic sup-
portive ability in C57Bl/6 and FVB/N background mice (30–
32) (Fig. 2D). Flow cytometry studies of adult PlpCre blood and
bone marrow confirmed the absence of EGFPþ within pro-
genitor and mature hematopoietic cells (data not shown).
These data indicate that loss of Nf1 within this model causes

an unidentified hematopoietic proliferative disorder distinc-
tive from JMML. Furthermore, because EGFPþ recombination
did not occur within hematopoietic-lineage cells, cell hyper-
proliferation occurs in a noncell autonomous fashion after
perinatal (P1–3) loss of Nf1 within PlpCreþ nonhematopoietic,
stromal cells.

Adult loss of Nf1 can cause neurofibroma formation

To test whether loss of Nf1 within adult animals can elicit
tumor phenotype(s) in vivo, we injected adult (8 to 10 weeks)
PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice with tamoxifen. All mutant mice required
sacrifice between 7 and 15 months of age (5 to 13 months post-
tamoxifen exposure) due to paralysis, whereas littermate WT
controls remained healthy (Fig. 3A; P < 0.0001). Hematopoietic
tumors were evident in 3 of 20 (15%) of adult tamoxifen-
injected PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals on gross dissection.

Gross dissections were carried out on the neuroaxis of 20
PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl animals. All had tumors associated with periph-
eral nerves and DRGs (Supplementary Table S1), and cranial-
facial nerves. Figure 3B displays representative tumors asso-
ciated with spinal and peripheral nerves of a PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl
animal, diagnosed as GEM Grade I neurofibromas after par-
affin embedding and staining with H&E (Fig. 3C). Similar to

perinatal PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl neurofibromas, these displayed low
cellularity with increased stroma between the cells. The neu-
rofibromas contained characteristic S100bþ cells and mast cell
infiltration (Fig. 3C).

Recombination was examined by PCR analysis (Fig. 3D). As
expected, recombination was noted within the brain and
peripheral nervous system (sciatic nerve and dorsal root gang-
lia). Recombination was also detected in the heart, lung, spleen,
thyroid, skin, fat, and bone. Recombination was absent within
the liver, kidney, and bone marrow. EGFPþ cells were present
within peripheral nerves throughout the body (data not
shown). Organ-specific EGFPþ cells were also noted within
the heart, lung, thyroid, and spleen (Supplementary Fig. 2),
likely accounting for some of the recombination observed.

Comparison of neurofibroma formation after perinatal
or adult tamoxifen exposure in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice

When compared with 15-month-old wild type controls
(Fig. 4A), PlpCre animals after either perinatal (Fig. 4B) or
adult (Fig. 4C) loss of Nf1 show neurofibroma formation in
cranial nerves (Fig. 4, top panel), DRGs, and peripheral nerves
(Fig. 4B & C). Cranial nerves commonly developed neurofi-
bromas extending into the face, neck, and tongue. These
tumors sometimes compressed the brainstem, which resulted
in head tilt and circling behavior (Fig. 4B asterisks). Neurofi-
bromas were larger in mice injected with tamoxifen as adults,
likely accounting for earlier animal lethality. Some tumors
compressed the spinal cord; however, commonly tumors
surrounded the DRG and extended laterally along peripheral

Remak bundle disruption within PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl
saphenous nerves
Electron microscopy compared saphenous nerves of 12-
month-old PlpCreþ;Nf1wt control (Fig. 5A), postnatal (P1–3)
tamoxifen-injected PlpCreþ;Nf1fl/fl (Fig. 5B), and adult tamox-
ifen-injected PlpCreþ;Nf1fl/fl animals (Fig. 5C) to determine
whether loss of Nf1 within PlpCreþ cells affects Remak
bundles. Similar to other mouse neurofibroma models, mye-
lination of large diameter axons appeared normal after either
perinatal or adult loss of Nf1 whereas perinatal or adult
tamoxifen exposure
caused Remak bundle disruption
(Fig. 5B & C). Thus many small caliber axons were found
in a one to one relationship with an attendant axon while
other Schwann cells were dissociated from axons completely,
and pathologically wrapped collagen.

PlpCre targets multiple glial cell types in the peripheral
nervous system: identification using EGFP

To define cells targeted by the PlpCre driver, we analyzed
PlpCre; CMB-b actin loxP EGFP flanked chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT) mice one-day-post last tamoxifen
injection (i.e., 4-days-post tamoxifen introduction). The per-
cent of EGFPþ; DAPIþ nonneuronal cells was higher in DRG
and sciatic nerve after perinatal injection compared with adult
tamoxifen injection (Fig. 6A left). The development of imma-
ture Schwann cells into myelinating and nonmyelinating
nerve Schwann cells is incomplete in perinatal life (12). There-
fore we focused on defining cell types expressing PlpCre
(EGFPþ staining) in adult mice. EGFP was detected in 7%
of the nonneuronal cells within cervical DRG and 18% of cells
within the adult sciatic nerve. The percentage of EGFPþ;
S100bþ satellite cells in the DRG was 11%; and myelinating
Schwann cells in sciatic nerve ¼ 25% (Fig. 6A right, & 6B).
S100bþ cells in the sciatic nerve were myelinating Schwann
cells as confirmed by double labeling with antiperiaxin (data

not shown). In neurofibromas, months after tamoxifen expo-
sure PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl cells continue to show EGFP double label-
ing with S100bþ (Fig. 6B).
In wild type mice, the percentage of double-labeled EGFPþ;
GFAPþ cells 4 days after tamoxifen within the DRG was 34%;
and sciatic nerve ¼ 0% (Fig. 6A right, & Fig. 6C). Thus, the
PlpCre construct is not active within the GFAPþ nonmyeli-
nating cells in the peripheral nerve. In neurofibromas, months
after tamoxifen exposure PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl cells did not express
GFAP (Fig. 6C).
There were no EGFPþ;p75þ wild type satellite cells within
the DRG 4 days after tamoxifen (Fig. 6D). EGFPþ;p75þ cells
were present in the sciatic nerve (Fig. 6D). EGFPþ cells (59% in
DRG, & 41% in sciatic nerve) double-labeled with the Schwann
cell and satellite cell marker glutathione synthase (GS) (Fig. 6A
right). Thus the PlpCre driver targets myelinating S100bþ
Schwann cells within the sciatic nerve, and unidentified p75þ
cells. Within the DRG, all EGFPþ cells had the morphology of
satellite cells, with distinctive cell processes wrapping around
DRG neurons.

Rapid onset of proliferation in Nf1 mutant cells

We noted that the numbers of EGFPþ cells in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl
dorsal root ganglia seemed to increase over time (Fig. 7A).
Quantification of EGFPþ cells at 1, 7, and 28 days following
tamoxifen injection in the sciatic nerve showed that beginning
1 day after the final tamoxifen injection the numbers of
EGFPþ cells were significantly increased in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl
as compared with wild type (Fig. 7B). We monitored cells
in the S-phase of the cell cycle with BrdU immunostaining.
Many nerve and neurofibroma EGFPþ cells were BrdUþ,
likely accounting at least in part for the observed increase
in cell number (Fig. 7C).

Discussion

In this study we found that both postnatal (P1–3) and
adult loss of Nf1 using the PlpCre driver cause GEM-grade I

neurofibroma tumor formation. The models differ in the
timing of neurofibroma formation, in the size of the neurofi-
bromas generated, and in prevalence of hematopoietic man-
ifestations. We found that myelinating Schwann cells, p75þ
cells, and satellite cells are targeted by the inducible PlpCre
driver. Our results support previous studies indicating that
loss of Nf1 in subpopulations of nerve Schwann cell lineage
cells cause neurofibroma formation, and extend these studies
by showing that acute Nf1 loss, after organogenesis and cell
differentiation, can be tumorigenic.
We identified EGFPþ cells to identify possible tumor cells
of origin in the PlpCre model. Tamoxifen exposure induced

peripheral nervous system recombination, as judged by
EGFPþ cells, in satellite cells in the DRG (S100bþ or GFAPþ)
with the characteristic morphology of satellite cells, closely
wrapping DRG cell bodies. In DhhCre;Nflfl/fl mice, satellite
cells do not show recombination, yet neurofibromas form (24).
While not definitive, the combination of the two models does
not support a role for satellite cells in mouse neurofibroma
formation; however, the possibility that satellite cells are
important for neurofibroma formation in some settings
whereas not in others cannot be excluded.
Most EGFPþ cells in adult peripheral nerves were S100bþ
(myelinating) Schwann cells. This result is expected, as

endogenous Plp is a characteristic of myelinating Schwann
cells in adult peripheral nerve (33). At the EM level, Nf1 loss
did not dramatically alter myelination.

Remak bundle disruption is a characteristic feature of all
neurofibroma models (22–24, 34). When the nonmyelinated
Schwann cell population was examined, no EGFPþ;GFAPþ
nonmyelinating Schwann cells were identified. These data are
surprising as electron microscopy shows disruption of the
association between axons and nonmyelinating Schwann cells
in the PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl model. We conclude that Nf1 loss within
GFAPþ cells is not necessary for Remak bundle disruption in
the PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl model.
We identified EGFPþ;p75þ cells in peripheral nerve. These
may be a subpopulation of GFAP-negative nonmyelinating
cells, and/or an as-yet unidentified population(s) in adult
peripheral nerve. Zheng and colleagues (2008) proposed that
the p75þ nonmyelinating cell population was the cell of origin
for neurofibroma formation (23). The present study eliminates

Neurofibroma Formation in Adult Mice

the GFAPþ nonmyelinating Schwann cell as the tumor-initi-
ating cell. It is possible that neurofibroma formation results
from the p75þ/GFAP-negative cells in peripheral nerve, and/
or that loss of Nf1 within mature myelinating Schwann cells
have noncell autonomous effect(s) that promote tumor for-
mation-–similar to the noncell autonomous effect on hema-
topoietic cells when Nf1 is lost within stromal cells.

Perinatal

tamoxifen injection into PlpCre;Nf

fl/fl mice
resulted in GEM grade I neurofibroma formation that resulted
in morbidity at 15 to 23 months old. In contrast, adult loss of
Nf1 resulted in large neurofibromas, which caused morbidity
beginning 5 months post-tamoxifen introduction. We consid-
ered the possibility that recombination occurs in more cells
when tamoxifen-induced recombination occurs in adults.
However, twice as many cells in sciatic nerve and three times
as many in the DRG were EGFPþ in pups as compared with
adult mice. Therefore together with previous studies showing
that loss of Nf1 in most developing Schwann cells leads to
robust neurofibroma formation (22–24) we conclude that cells
exist in the adult peripheral nervous system that remain
susceptible to neurofibroma formation, and that the suscep-
tible population(s) may be enriched in adult and embryonic
nervous systems.

A study submitted by Le and colleagues confirms our
observation that neurofibromas can form after perinatal or
adult loss of Nf1. However, while they identified small neurofi-
bromas at the thoracic and lumbo-sacral levels after adult loss
of Nf1, we generated large neurofibromas throughout the
neuroaxis. Some differences between the two studies may
account for the slightly different findings. Le and colleagues
provided 4 mg tamoxifen (2 mg twice daily) by oral gavage to
adult mice for 5 days, whereas we dosed 1 mg twice day by i.p.
injection for 3 days. It is also possible that the different
phenotypes result from the different tamoxifen-inducible
PlpCre driver lines used in the two studies. This difference
may well account for the absence of hematopoietic lesions in
their system. Most importantly, our data do not support the
idea that there is a critical window for neurofibroma formation.
Mast cells, and other hematopoietic cells, showed <1%
recombination in PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice, yet neurofibroma for-
mation was robust. While Krox20Cre;Nf1fl/fl mice show hyper-
plasia within the DRG, neurofibroma development required
an Nf1þ/ 
background attributed to Nf1þ/- mast cells (22, 35).
DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl animals develop neurofibromas when only
lineage cells are Nf1 mutant (24), and the
Schwann cell
PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl model is similar in that a heterozygous back-
ground is not necessary for neurofibroma formation.

The peripheral blood of PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl mice showed a
decrease in monocytes with a relative increase in lymphocytes
and polymorphonuclear (PMN). In contrast, Nf1 loss driven by
Mx1–Cre causes a mouse disorder similar to human juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), with hyperproliferation of
all hematopoietic cell types and progressive myeloproliferative
disorder (36, 37, 38). Flow cytometry and immunohistochem-
istry showed that the PlpCre transgene did not cause Nf1 loss
in cells of hematopoietic origin. Rather, EGFPþ cells within
these tumors had a stromal/mesenchymal appearance, and
some double-labeled with Sca-1. EGFP expression did not

colocalize with the expression of hematopoietic lineage mar-
kers or c-kit (data not shown), indicating that recombined
EGFPþ cells had a nonhematopoietic and mesenchymal
origin (30, 39).

The idea that Nf1 loss can affect tumorigenesis in a noncell
autonomous fashion (e.g., myelinating cells acting upon other
cells in the nerve) is thus supported by analogy to the for-
mation of hematopoietic lesions within the PlpCre;Nf1fl/fl
animals, in which mutant stromal cells after either perinatal
or adult tamoxifen-induced Nf1 loss, cause lymphoid and
myeloid proliferation. However we cannot exclude the possi-
bility that neurofibroma formation requires Nf1 loss of func-
tion in a small population of stem/progenitor-like cells that
remain unidentified by our analysis, or induces expression of
chemoattractants that result in massive tissue infiltration by
hematopoietic cells. In either event, neurofibroma formation
is not restricted to loss of Nf1 in embryonic life, but can be
triggered by Nf1 loss throughout life.
