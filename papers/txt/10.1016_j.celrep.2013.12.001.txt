SUMMARY

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)
are highly aggressive sarcomas that develop sporad-
ically or in neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients.
There is no effective treatment for MPNSTs and
they are typically fatal. To gain insights into MPNST
pathogenesis, we utilized an MPNST mouse model
that allowed us to study the evolution of these tumors
at the transcriptome level. Strikingly, in MPNSTs we
found upregulation of a chromatin regulator, Brd4,
and show that BRD4 inhibition profoundly sup-
presses both growth and tumorigenesis. Our ﬁnd-
ings reveal roles for BET bromodomains in MPNST
development and report a mechanism by which
bromodomain inhibition induces apoptosis through
induction of proapoptotic Bim, which may repre-
sent a paradigm shift
in therapy for MPNST
patients. Moreover, these ﬁndings indicate epige-
netic mechanisms underlying the balance of anti-
and proapoptotic molecules and that bromodomain
inhibition can shift this balance in favor of cancer
cell apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hu-
man genetic disorders of the nervous system and affects one in
3,500 individuals around the world regardless of ethnicity and
gender (Wallace et al., 1990). NF1 manifests through inheritance
or sporadic mutation of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene, a nega-
tive regulator of oncogenic p21-RAS, which predisposes NF1
patients to a wide spectrum of symptoms including develop-
mental, neurological, dermatological, and cardiovascular
defects and tumor development (Le and Parada, 2007; Martin
et al., 1990). Although NF1 patients are susceptible to devel-

rhabdomyosarcoma),

oping various neoplasms (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,
optic glioma, astrocytoma,
the most
common occurring are benign neuroﬁbromas, which can be
stratiﬁed into two subgroups: plexiform and dermal (Albers and
Gutmann, 2009; Bajenaru et al., 2003; Le and Parada, 2007;
Shannon et al., 1992). Plexiform neuroﬁbromas can progress
to malignant sarcomas known as malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which account for 10% of all soft
tissue sarcomas (King et al., 2000). They are highly aggressive,
incurable through conventional chemotherapy or surgical
resection, and a leading cause of mortality in the NF1 patient
population (Duong et al., 2011). Although signiﬁcant progress
in understanding NF1 tumor development has been made,
surgery remains the standard of care for MPNST patients, and
prognosis remains bleak (Zou et al., 2009).

Neuroﬁbroma progression to MPNST in NF1 patients is asso-
ciated with additional genetic changes including ampliﬁcation/
overexpression of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e.,
EGFR, PDGFR, MET) or growth factors (i.e., neuregulin-1, hepa-
tocyte growth factor) and loss of tumor suppressors Ink4a, Pten,
or P53 (the latter being the most common) (Cichowski et al.,
1999; Endo et al., 2011; Gregorian et al., 2009; Huijbregts
et al., 2003; Joseph et al., 2008; Keng et al., 2012; Ling et al.,
2005; Perrone et al., 2009; Perry et al., 2002; Torres et al.,
2011; Vogel et al., 1999). Modeling these genetic changes along-
side loss of Nf1 in mice has been reported to promote MPNST
development, which conﬁrms their contributions to MPNST
pathogenesis. This has led to the identiﬁcation of therapeutic
targets regulating the cell cycle, thus allowing for inhibition of
proliferation, but eventual resistance or tumor burden are likely
to hinder the efﬁcacy of such agents (Albritton et al., 2006;
Jessen et al., 2013; Johannessen et al., 2008; Mo et al., 2013;
Patel et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013a). Selective inhibition of both
proliferation and survival may offer MPNST patients a better
prognosis. However,
limited capability to culture human
MPNSTs and lack of a model system that permits genome-
wide analysis or functional interrogation of MPNSTs and their
pre-tumorigenic counterparts have hindered the elucidation of

survival dependencies in MPNSTs. We and others have
developed mouse models in which genetic loss of tumor sup-
pressors Nf1 and P53 leads to spontaneous initiation of MPNSTs
(Cichowski et al., 1999; Vogel et al., 1999) (L.Q.L., unpublished
data). More recently, we identiﬁed skin-derived precursors
(SKPs) with Nf1 deﬁciency to be a cell of origin for dermal neuro-
ﬁbromas (Le et al., 2009).

Serendipitously, we found that Nf1-deﬁcient SKPs are also
capable of giving rise to plexiform neuroﬁbromas when trans-
planted into a nerve, and further loss of P53 readily allows for
malignant transformation into MPNSTs with histological and
molecular features consistent with human MPNSTs (Mo et al.,
2013; Chau et al., 2013). This MPNST mouse model affords us
the opportunity to monitor the evolution of these tumors from
stem cell to benign neuroﬁbroma to MPNST. Here, we utilized
our SKP-derived MPNST model to study the evolution of these
tumors by comparative transcriptome analysis of SKP-derived
MPNSTs (sMPNSTs) and their pretumorigenic ancestors,
Nf1;P53-deﬁcient SKPs (NP-SKPs), and identify upregulation
of Brd4 in MPNSTs.

We investigated the role of BRD4 in MPNST pathogenesis.
BRD4 is a BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) family member
that contains two bromodomains in tandem, which permit
recognition and binding to acetylated histones, and subsequent
recruitment of cofactors (including pTEFb) for RNA polymerase-
II-dependent transcription elongation (Dey et al., 2003; Jang
et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2013b; Yang et al., 2005). BRD4 is reported
to regulate expression of mitotic genes required for cell-cycle
progression, and its fusion to NUT (nuclear protein in testis)
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NUT-midline carci-
nomas (Filippakopoulos et al., 2010; Mochizuki et al., 2008;
Yang et al., 2008). The development of selective small molecule
inhibitors of BRD4, called JQ1, I-BET 151, and CPI203, has
allowed for selective inhibition of C-Myc expression and self-
renewal in hematopoietic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia,
mixed lineage leukemia, multiple myeloma, and T cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia), thus establishing JQ1 or I-BET 151-
mediated inhibition of BRD4 as therapeutic strategy to disable
oncogenic C-Myc (Dawson et al., 2011; Delmore et al., 2011;
King et al., 2013; Zuber et al., 2011). Recent evidence indicates
that BRD4 and Mediator together occupy mostly active genes in
multiple myeloma cells, and at high concentrations at superen-
hancers for key oncogenic drivers or cell identity genes (Love´ n
et al., 2013). These superenhancer-regulated genes have been
shown to be highly sensitive to levels of BRD4 or its cofactors,
such that selective inhibition with JQ1 leads to substantial sup-
pression of their transcription elongation, whereas active genes
with typical enhancers are less affected (Love´ n et al., 2013). All
together, these ﬁndings suggest that the concentration/levels
of BRD4 and its cofactors are important for the maintaining
high levels of cancer cell speciﬁc oncogenes, thus indicating a
general strategy for identifying dependencies in diverse cancer
types (Love´ n et al., 2013). Whether the levels of BRD4 and its
cofactors are important for solid tumor initiation and progres-
sion, including MPNSTs, remains unknown.

Here, we show that increased levels of BRD4 accompany the
progression of pretumorigenic NP-SKPs to MPNSTs in vivo.

associated MPNSTs. Transcriptome and genomic occupancy
analysis of BRD4 inhibition in MPNSTs reveals downregulation
of Cyclin D1 and Bcl2 expression along with derepression of
Bim transcription, which we demonstrate to suppress tumori-
genesis and initiate apoptosis of MPNSTs. Collectively, our
ﬁndings reveal a role for BET bromodomains in maintaining the
growth and survival of NF1-associated MPNSTs and identify a
therapeutic strategy for selective inhibition of MPNST tumori-
genesis and survival, which may serve to improve the prognosis
for NF1-associated MPNST patients.

Transcriptome Analysis of Nf1
Progression to MPNST Identiﬁes Upregulation of Brd4
Previously, we established a mouse model of dermal neuroﬁ-
broma (dNF) where we demonstrate that Nf1-deﬁcient SKPs
can give rise to dNFs, which is contingent on their local micro-
environment (Le et al., 2009). In the course of these SKP and
neuroﬁbroma studies, we serendipitously found that we could
faithfully generate MPNSTs from SKPs doubly deﬁcient in Nf1
and P53 (NP-SKPs) (Mo et al., 2013; Chau et al., 2013). This
ﬁnding creates a powerful MPNST model that affords us the
opportunity to genetically monitor the evolution of MPNSTs
from their pretumorigenic precursors (NP-SKPs). These SKP-
derived MPNSTs (sMPNSTs) were found to have a robust poten-
tial for giving rise to tumors when either transplanted as tumor
fragments or as few as 10,000 cells, whereas their ancestors
(NP-SKPs) required at least 100,000 cells and longer time in vivo
to become sMPNSTs. These observations led us to hypothesize
that dual loss of tumor suppressors Nf1 and P53 is required but
not sufﬁcient for progression of NP-SKPs to sMPNSTs. We
envisioned that further genetic or epigenetic changes, the micro-
environment, cells of origin, or multiple factors are required for
progression to MPNST. Although these complexities pose
challenges to addressing our hypothesis, we reasoned that
underlying transcriptome changes would allow us to molecularly
understand tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression regu-
lated in this model system. Advantageously, our MPNST mouse
model allows us to take our transcriptome insights and system-
atically and rapidly determine how MPNST tumorigenesis is
regulated. Therefore, we compared the gene expression proﬁles
of sMPNST tumors to their pretumorigenic ancestors (NP-SKPs)
via microarray analysis to understand what
transcriptome
changes occur after MPNST tumor initiation/progression (Fig-
ure 1A). As anticipated, comparative microarray analysis
indicates that sMPNST tumors had numerous genes up- and
downregulated when compared to their ancestors (NP-SKPs).
However, we found substantially more genes upregulated, and
with greater magnitude of fold change expression (Figure 1B),
which was associated with upregulation of RNA polymerase II
(RNAP II) regulator Brd4 (Figure 1C). Quantitative RT-PCR and
western blot analyses conﬁrm these ﬁndings (Figures 1D and
1E). Consistent with these data, we also observed abundant
expression of BRD4 in human MPNST primary tissue and xeno-
graft (Figure S1). BRD4 along with Mediator and pTEFb are all
implicated in promoting RNA polymerase-II (RNAP II)-dependent

transcriptional elongation (Donner et al., 2010; Jang et al., 2005;
Wu and Chiang, 2007) (Figure 1C). BRD4 has been previously
implicated in cancer biology (Dawson et al., 2011; Delmore
et al., 2011; Filippakopoulos et al., 2010; Firestein et al., 2008;
Love´ n et al., 2013; Zuber et al., 2011) and is currently amenable
to pharmacological inhibition through small molecule bromodo-
main inhibitor JQ1 (Filippakopoulos et al., 2010), which may
present a novel therapeutic modality for treating NF1-associated
MPNSTs. Thus, we focused on elucidating the role of BRD4 in
MPNSTs.

Brd4 Is Critical for Growth and Tumorigenic Capacity
of MPNSTs
We sought to dissect the function of BRD4 in MPNSTs by
employing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible small hairpin RNA
(shRNA) system to acutely knockdown Brd4 mRNA levels.
sMPNST cells were transduced with lentivirus harboring either
scrambled shRNA (pTripz-shCONTROL) or Brd4 shRNAs
(pTripz-shBrd4.523 or pTripz-shBrd4.552), and then treated
with puromycin to select for stably infected cells. Treatment of
these cells with doxycycline to induce shRNA expression re-
veals >80% reduction of Brd4 mRNA levels via Brd4 shRNAs
compared to scrambled shRNA (shCONTROL) induction, which
is consistent with protein levels (Figures 1F and 1G). To evaluate
the effect of acute depletion of Brd4 on sMPNST cellular growth,
we evaluated ATP levels as a surrogate for cell numbers before
and after acute knockdown of Brd4 and observed signiﬁcantly
reduced growth upon Brd4 shRNA induction with doxycycline
(Figure 1H).

To study the inﬂuence of BRD4 on the tumorigenic capacity of
MPNST cells, we subcutaneously injected pTripz-shCONTROL
and pTripz-shBrd4 sMPNST cells (Luciferase tagged) into nude
mice. Two days later, both scrambled and Brd4 shRNAs were
turned on in sMPNST allografts by administration of doxycycline
(1 mg/ml) through drinking water of the mice. By 30 days of
shRNA induction in vivo, we found that Brd4 shRNA-sMPNST
cells had signiﬁcantly delayed tumor burden/progression
compared to control as indicated by periodic measurements of
tumor bioluminescence and volume and ﬁnal weight of excised
tumors (Figures 2A–2E). Remarkably, induction of Brd4 shRNA
expression in established tumors (30 days after subcutaneous
implantation) halted sMPNST tumor progression/growth when
compared to shCONTROL sMPNST tumors (Figures 2F and
2G). Western blot analysis of these tumors indicates that these
ﬁndings are consistent with reduced BRD4 protein levels in
shBrd4+Dox tumors (Figure 2H). Through molecular analysis of
tumor proliferation, we found that shBrd4 tumors had signiﬁ-
cantly fewer bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells than
shCONTROL tumors (Figures 2I and 2J). All together, these
data indicate an important role for BRD4 in maintaining tumori-
genic capacity of MPNSTs in vivo.

Pharmacological Inhibition of Brd4 Suppresses MPNST
Growth and Tumorigenesis
The remarkable inhibition of MPNST tumorigenesis through Brd4
knockdown prompted us to evaluate the effect of inhibiting
BRD4 with small molecule BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1
(Filippakopoulos et al., 2010). We tested the effect of JQ1 on

84 Cell Reports 6, 81–92, January 16, 2014 ª2014 The Authors

pretumorigenic NP-SKPs, sMPNST cells, and cis MPNST cells
(derived from spontaneous MPNST arising in cis Nf1+/ 
P53+/ 
mice) (Mo et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 1999). All MPNST cells and
NP-SKPs had decreased cellular viability/growth in a JQ1
dose-dependent manner with IC50 values less than 400 nM,
whereas SKPs (both wild-type and Nf1 null) were relatively
unaffected (Figure 3A). These data may suggest a role for
BRD4 in maintaining in vitro growth and survival signaling prop-
agated by loss of both Nf1 and P53 in MPNSTs and their pretu-
morigenic precursors (NP-SKPs). Collectively, these promising
ﬁndings suggest that JQ1 may have important therapeutic value
in the treatment of MPNSTs.

In that regard,

to investigate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
JQ1 on MPNST tumor progression, we generated palpable
(50 mm3 average) sMPNST allografts (luciferase expressing) in
14 nude mice (two tumors per mouse). Prior to drug administra-
tion, we measured tumor volume and bioluminescence to sepa-
rate tumor-bearing mice into two groups (14 tumors per group),
in which tumor size and mouse gender/weight are equally rep-
resented (Figure 3B). Mice were treated with either vehicle or
JQ1 for 15 days and then sacriﬁced. During this treatment
period, we found that growth of all JQ1-treated tumors (n =
14) had been severely blunted compared to vehicle-treated
tumors (n = 14) as indicated by delayed progression of tumor
bioluminescence and volume (Figures 3C and 3D). Interestingly,
during the course of the experiment, we observed sMPNST
tumor
regression in JQ1-treated mice both visually and
through bioluminescence imaging (Figure 3E). Remarkably, we
observed 50% to near complete regression of tumor volume
in as little as 10 days of JQ1 treatment, which resulted in
much smaller tumors compared to vehicle tumors (Figures 3F
and 3G). Moreover, analysis of tumor proliferation revealed
signiﬁcantly fewer BrdU-positive cells in JQ1-treated sMPNST
allografts compared to vehicle (Figures 3H and 3I). Importantly,
we observed no signiﬁcant changes in body weight nor behavior
of mice during JQ1 treatment (data not shown), which is consis-
tent with JQ1 tolerance observed in published mouse studies
(Cheng et al., 2013; Delmore et al., 2011; Filippakopoulos
et al., 2010; Zuber et al., 2011). These data strongly suggest
great therapeutic potential for JQ1 in the treatment of NF1-
associated MPNSTs.

Brd4 Regulates MPNST Cell-Cycle Progression and
Cyclin D1 Expression
To gain insight into the mechanism of action for BRD4 in
MPNST tumorigenesis, we ﬁrst evaluated the effect of genetic
and pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 on sMPNST cell num-
ber. On average, we found that induction of Brd4 shRNAs led
to 60%–65% reduction in cell number after 5 days in culture
compared to cells without induction or shCONTROL cells (Fig-
ure 4A). We observed a similar effect on sMPNST cells
treated 4 days with JQ1 (Figure 4B). These data suggested
inhibition of MPNST proliferation through BRD4 inhibition.
Indeed, we found that BRD4 inhibition restrains MPNST cell-
cycle progression. Analysis of proliferation via BrdU incorpora-
tion and DNA content by ﬂow cytometry led us to ﬁnd that
BRD4 depletion leads to signiﬁcant reduction of BrdU incorpo-
ration, a predominant increase in percentage of cells in G1

phase (Figure 4C). We observed similar results in both sMPNST
cells and S462 human MPNST cells treated with JQ1 (Figures
4C and 4D). Collectively, these data suggest that genetic and
pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 impedes MPNST cell-cycle
progression.

Previously, we and others described a role for the CXCR4/
b-catenin signaling pathway in stimulating MPNST cell-cycle
progression via control of Cyclin D1 mRNA expression, which
highlights the importance of Cyclin D1 maintenance in MPNST
cell-cycle control (Mo et al., 2013). How Cyclin D1 transcription
is regulated in MPNSTs remains unknown, but previous reports

indicate Cyclin D1 as a potential target of BRD4 (Mochizuki et al.,
2008; Yang et al., 2008). Therefore, we sought to determine if
BRD4 directly regulates Cyclin D1 transcription in MPNSTs.
Through chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR
(ChIP-qPCR) analysis, we found that BRD4 occupies the pro-
moter of Cyclin D1, and that displacement of BRD4 from
chromatin by JQ1 treatment led to reduced promoter occupancy
in sMPNST cells (Figure 4E). Consequently, we found that
shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological
inhibition of
BRD4 leads to substantial decrease in Cyclin D1 mRNA and
protein abundance in MPNST cells, whereas other cell-cycle
regulators are less affected by Brd4 shRNA or JQ1 in sMPNST
cells (Figures 4F–4H). Together, these data point to a mechanism
of BRD4-mediated epigenetic control of Cyclin D1 transcription
and suggest BRD4 as a therapeutic target for inhibiting onco-
genic Cyclin D1 in MPNSTs.

Brd4 Regulates Expression of Proapoptotic Bim
Cell-cycle arrest can lead to subsequent cellular apoptosis (Pie-
tenpol and Stewart, 2002). Further analysis of acute knockdown
of Brd4 in MPNST led us to observe increased ﬂoating cells in
culture (Figure 5A), which was suggestive of apoptosis induction.
Indeed, we found an increase in apoptotic cells and activation of
apoptotic markers in both mouse and human MPNST cells with

 / 

BRD4 inhibition (Figures 5B–5D). On the
other hand, we observed that both wild-
SKPs do not
type SKPs and Nf1
undergo robust apoptosis when treated with JQ1 (Figure S2).
To elucidate how BRD4 inhibition triggers apoptosis of MPNSTs,
we performed gene expression microarray analysis to ﬁrst iden-
tify differentially expressed genes in MPNST cells with or without
BRD4 inhibition (both shRNA and JQ1), which led us to identify
upregulation of proapoptotic BIM (Bcl2l11) (Figure 5E). We also
found that BRD4 inhibition decreased expression of antiapop-
totic Bcl2 in our microarray data (data not shown). Quantitative
RT-PCR and western blot analyses conﬁrm that BRD4 inhibition
(shRNA or JQ1) leads to induction of BIM and downregulation of
BCL-2, and relatively minor effect on the expression of additional
apoptosis regulators evaluated (Figures 5F and 5G). BIM is a pro-
apoptotic, BH3-domain-containing protein that is thought to play
a central role in apoptosis through activation of proapoptotic BAX
and BAK, which leads to mitochondrial permeabilization that is
followed by activation of caspases and apoptosis (Bean et al.,
2013; Tait and Green, 2010; Wei et al., 2001). BCL-2 is an antia-
poptotic protein that is thought to prevent BAX/BAK activation
(Cheng et al., 2001). One of the mechanisms is through inhibi-
tion/sequestration of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as
BIM and PUMA (Cheng et al., 2001; Letai et al., 2002; Youle
and Strasser, 2008).

To determine if BRD4-inhibition-mediated downregulation
of Bcl2 expression promotes MPNST apoptosis, we treated

MPNST cells with ABT-263, a selective small molecule that
inhibits BCL-2/BCL-XL, which prevents sequestration of proap-
optotic BIM or PUMA. We found that BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibition
with ABT-263 is not sufﬁcient to trigger robust apoptosis of
MPNST cells (Figure S4), which suggests that perhaps inhibition
of BRD4 leading to induction of Bim initiates MPNST apoptosis.
Indeed, we found that constitutive knockdown of Bim
attenuates/rescues JQ1-induced apoptosis in multiple MPNST
cell types as indicated by reduced caspase-3 cleavage and
fewer apoptotic cells (Figures 5H and 5I). Collectively, these ﬁnd-
ings lead us to propose a model in which BRD4 inhibition or JQ1
treatment initiates apoptosis through induction of proapoptotic
Bim, and suppression of antiapoptotic Bcl2 to trigger apoptosis
of NF1-associated MPNSTs (Figure 5J). Furthermore, the dual
restraint on proliferation and survival may indicate how BRD4
inhibition is exquisitely effective against MPNSTs.

DISCUSSION

Here, we employed a mouse model of MPNST that allowed us to
study the evolution of these tumors at the transcriptome level,
which permitted us to identify and elucidate a mechanistic basis
for Brd4 in maintaining the tumorigenic capacity and survival of
MPNSTs. Importantly, this study translates basic insights into a
therapeutically tractable target for impeding the progression
and survival of incurable NF1-associated MPNSTs, which may
represent a signiﬁcant paradigm shift
for MPNST patient
therapy. We also provide a mechanism of action as a framework
for developing new therapeutic strategies to disarm remaining
cell-survival networks that MPNSTs may rely upon.

Although traditional Genetic Engineered Mouse Models
(GEMMs) with loss of tumor suppressors Nf1 and P53 have pro-
vided a genetic basis for MPNST pathogenesis, their utility for
discovering therapeutic targets to impede both progression
and survival of these tumors has remained limited. In addition,
the traditional route to study the function of additional genes in
a GEMM would require generating new mouse strains (knockout,
knockin, or conditional alleles), which incurs a longer time
horizon and costs toward studying gene function (Heyer et al.,
2010). Moreover, if one wishes to study gene expression at
different stages of tumor evolution, isolation of relatively homog-
enous cells from spontaneously arising tumors in traditional
GEMMs would prove difﬁcult (Heyer et al., 2010). Although
SKPs are a cell of origin for dermal neuroﬁbromas, at present it
is not clear that SKPs are a cell of origin for MPNSTs in humans.
SKPs can undergo
Nevertheless, observing that Nf1
malignant transformation to MPNSTs suggested a novel oppor-
tunity to delineate what molecular changes underlie MPNST
development. Thus, in this study, we took advantage of our
nongermline GEMM of NF1-associated MPNST to study the

transcriptome of relatively homogenous sMPNSTs and their pre-
tumorigenic precursors (NP-SKPs). The elevated expression of
Brd4 in our sMPNST transcriptome data captured our attention.
Our ability to genetically and pharmacologically inhibit BRD4 in a
temporal manner with great haste and ease in our stem/
progenitor transplantation model allowed us to elucidate the
role of BRD4 in MPNST tumorigenesis. These results highlight
the strength and speed in which our nongermline GEMM can
accelerate discovery of tractable therapeutic targets for rare
malignancies that represent an unmet medical need.

As a proof of principle, using this sMPNST model, we and our
colleagues previously delineated a signaling pathway in which
cell-surface receptor CXCR4 mediates intracellular activation of
b-catenin, which leads to expression of Cyclin D1 and estab-
lished a critical role for Cyclin D1 in promoting cell-cycle pro-
gression and tumorigenesis of MPNSTs (Mo et al., 2013). In
agreement, another group identiﬁed Wnt/b-catenin signaling as
a potential driver of MPNSTs through a Sleeping Beauty genetic
screen and found that this pathway regulates Cyclin D1 expres-
sion in MPNSTs as well (Rahrmann et al., 2013; Watson et al.,
2013). In the current study presented here, we demonstrate
that BRD4 occupies the promoter of Cyclin D1 in MPNSTs, and
that pharmacological
inhibition with JQ1 inhibits BRD4 occu-
pancy at that promoter leading to decreased expression of Cyclin
D1, which correlates with decreased proliferation observed. In
contrast, BRD4 has been shown to be required for maintaining
transcription of oncogenic c-Myc in hematopoietic malignancies,
but we did not observe loss of c-Myc expression in MPNSTs with
BRD4 inhibition (data not shown). This cancer cell type speciﬁcity
for regulating tumor oncogenes through BRD4 can now be attrib-
uted to the recent discovery of BRD4-regulated superenhancers
in multiple myeloma and other cancers (Love´ n et al., 2013). Those
ﬁndings suggest that BRD4 may maintain the cancer cell state
through transcriptional regulation of speciﬁc oncogenes depend-
ing on the cell type of origin (c-Myc in the case of leukemia and
multiple myeloma, and Cyclin D1 in NF1-associated MPNSTs)
(Delmore et al., 2011; Zuber et al., 2011).

Most importantly, our ﬁndings point to a mechanism of action
by which bromodomain inhibition induces apoptosis through
induction proapoptotic effector molecule BIM. We demonstrate
that knockdown of Bim can rescue MPNST cells from JQ1-
induced apoptosis, which further highlights the importance of
this ﬁnding. Interestingly, in support for the role of Bim in MPNST
tumor development, we observed that sMPNST cells with
Bim knockdown had elevated tumor bioluminescence when
compared control sMPNST cells. Thus, further highlighting the
importance of Bim regulation through BRD4 (Figure S3).

Albeit, additional mechanisms underlying JQ1-induced death
in MPNSTs may exist. For example, we observed downregula-
tion of Bcl2 expression in BRD4-inhibited MPNSTs, which is

consistent with a study involving bromodomain inhibition in
MLL-fusion leukemia (Dawson et al., 2011). However, through
direct inhibition of BCL-2 using ABT-263 we did not observe sig-
niﬁcant apoptosis compared to JQ1, which suggests that BCL-2
inhibition alone does not induce MPNST apoptosis robustly, but,
in combination with BIM induction, can efﬁciently induce
apoptosis. Our observations suggest that bromodomain inhibi-
tion with JQ1 induces Bim and downregulates Bcl2 expression,
leading to an imbalance of pro- and antiapoptotic effectors that
favors induction of apoptosis (Figure 5J), and supports the
model for an antiapoptotic/proapoptotic BCL-2 rheostat (Bean
et al., 2013; Corcoran et al., 2013). Consistent with this idea,
we found that further inhibition of BCL-2 with ABT-263 syner-
gizes with JQ1 or shBrd4 to more potently induce MPNST
apoptosis (Figure S4).

On the other hand, we observed that a majority of JQ1-regu-
lated genes do not overlapping with shBrd4-regulated genes (Fig-
ure S5), which is expected given that JQ1 also inhibits Brd2 and
Brd3. It remains unknown whether additional BET bromodomain
proteins (BRD2, BRD3) (also targeted by JQ1) play a role in
SKP and
MPNST pathogenesis. However, in our Nf1
MPNST microarray data, differential expression of neither Brd2
nor Brd3 was observed, which is contrary to what we observed
for Brd4 (data not shown). Nonetheless, the role of additional
BET bromodomain family members (including Brd2 and Brd3)
will be of interest in future studies, but at present, it remains clear
from our ﬁndings that BIM induction plays a central role in shBrd4/
JQ1-induced apoptosis in MPNSTs. More broadly, these ﬁndings
suggest an epigenetic mechanism underlying the balance of pro-
apoptotic/antiapoptotic proteins that can be exploited by BET
bromodomain inhibitors for inducing cancer cell apoptosis.

All together, the dual effect of growth inhibition and apoptosis
leading to tumor regression via JQ1 may allow physicians to
utilize JQ1 along with surgery to better manage these tumors
in NF1 patients. Although JQ1 remains to be optimized for
clinical development,
its equivalent bromodomain inhibitor
I-BET 151 is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials
and we hope will reach patients in the clinic (http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov). Future studies to molecularly understand
how JQ1 induces proapoptotic Bim should lead to new targets
or additional approved drugs for therapeutically inducing this
apoptotic pathway, and we speculate those studies would allow
more rapid or synergistic induction of tumor regression. There-
fore, this may allow physicians to limit drug exposure to patients
while maintaining or boosting therapeutic efﬁcacy.

In conclusion, we took advantage of an MPNST mouse model
that permits the study of tumor evolution for transcriptome
analysis, which allowed us to identify and elucidate mechanisms
for BRD4 in MPNST growth and survival. Our ﬁndings collectively
provide a strong preclinical basis for evaluating BET bro-
modomain inhibitors as novel therapies for these life-threatening
MPNSTs in NF1 patients.

S462 human MPNST cell line is a gift from Dr. Karen Cichowski (Brigham
and Women’s Hospital, MA). All MPNST cells (mouse and human) are cultured
in DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-gluta-
mine, 1% sodium pyruvate). SKPs were prepared and cultured as described
(Biernaskie et al., 2006).

Animal Studies
All mice were housed in the animal facility at the University of Texas South-
western Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW). Animal care and use were in compli-
ance with regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory
Committee at UTSW. Athymic nude mice were used for tumor studies. For
shRNA induction in sMPNST-pTripz tumors in vivo, mice were given water
containing 1 mg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5% sucrose. For daily
drug administration, a single dose of vehicle or 50 mg/kg JQ1 (Cayman
Chemical) were prepared as described (Filippakopoulos et al., 2010; Zuber
et al., 2011). Tumor volume was calculated as described (Mo et al., 2013).
D-Luciferin (50 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection followed
by bioluminescent imaging of mice 10 min later with IVIS Spectrum system
(Caliper Life Sciences).

Lentiviral Constructs
Mouse Brd4 shRNAs were generated by synthesizing 22-mer sequences cor-
responding to Brd4 shRNAs described previously (Zuber et al., 2011) for PCR
cloning into pTripz lentiviral vector. For lentivirus production, psPAX2 and
pMD2.g (Addgene plasmids 12260 and 12259) packaging vectors were used.

In Vitro Growth Assays
ATP CellTiter Glo assay (Promega) was performed as per manufacturer’s
instructions. The FLUOstar OPTIMA 96-well plate reader (BMG Labtech)
was used for luminescence measurements.

BrdU Cell-Cycle Analysis and Annexin V Flow Cytometry
Cell-cycle studies were conducted using BrdU Flow kit (BD Biosciences) as
per manufacturer’s instructions. For analysis of cellular apoptosis/death,
Annexin V-FITC Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used as per manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. All ﬂow cytometry was performed using FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer
(BD Biosciences) at the UTSW Flow Cytometry core facility. Data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, qRT-PCR
RNEasy mini kit (QIAGEN) was used to isolate total RNA from cells, followed by
cDNA synthesis with iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and then
qRT-PCR using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on the CFX
Connect Real-Time PCR platform (Bio-Rad). Data were quantiﬁed by DCt
method and normalized relative to Gapdh. See Figure S6 for primers used.

Expression Microarray Analysis
For Figure 1, total RNA was isolated from sMPNST tumors and NP-SKPs from
which those tumors were derived from (three biological replicates were
prepared for both groups). For microarray analysis of shBrd4 and JQ1 effect
on sMPNST cells, technical replicates (n = 3) were used for the experiment.
RNA quality and microarray experiments using Mouse Genome 430 2.0
microarrays (Affymetrix) were conducted by the UT Southwestern Microarray
core facility. Data were analyzed with GeneSpring GX software (Agilent
Technologies).

Western Blot
Protein isolation and subsequent western blot analysis were performed as
described previously (Mo et al., 2013). Antibodies used were as follows:
BRD4 (Epitomics, Bethyl Labs); BIM, Cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology); Cleaved Parp, Cyclin D1 (Millipore); and Bcl2, Gapdh (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Cells and Reagents
Primary sMPNST and Cis MPNST cells were established from SKP-MPNST
and cisNP model mice as described (Mo et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 1999).

Immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissue sample preparation, immunohistochemistry, and data quantiﬁ-
cation was performed as described previously (Mo et al., 2013). Antibodies
used were BRD4 (Bethyl Laboratories) and BrdU (Dako).

Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation qPCR
ChIP experiments were conducted as described in detailed protocol from
Abcam. Brieﬂy, chromatin equivalent to 25 mg DNA was 10-fold diluted in IP
dilution buffer, precleared by 1 hr incubation with ChIP-Grade Protein A/G
Plus Agarose beads (Thermo Scientiﬁc), and then incubated overnight with
Brd4 or control immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, 2 hr with protein A/G agarose
beads, followed by wash, elution, and DNA puriﬁcation (phenol/chloroform
extraction followed by ethanol precipitation). For qPCR analysis, each IP signal
was normalized to input signal to plot data as percentage of input. Antibodies
used were as follows: BRD4 (Bethyl Labs) and control IgG (Cell Signaling
Technology).

Statistical Analyses
All data are displayed as the mean ± SEM unless speciﬁed otherwise. A two-
tailed t test was used to evaluate statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05 was deemed
statistically signiﬁcant).
