SUMMARY

The Hippo pathway is emerging as a key evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism that 
controls organ size. Three membrane-associated proteins, Kibra, Merlin, and Expanded regulate 
pathway activity, but the precise molecular mechanism by which they function is still poorly 
understood. Here we provide evidence that Merlin and Kibra activate Hippo signaling in parallel to 
Expanded at a spatially distinct cellular domain, the medial apical cortex. Merlin and Kibra 
together recruit the adapter protein Salvador, which in turn recruits the core kinase Hippo. In 
addition, we show that Crumbs has a dual effect on Hippo signaling. Crumbs promotes the ability 
of Expanded to activate the pathway, but also sequesters Kibra to downregulate Hippo signaling. 
Together, our findings elucidate the mechanism of Hippo pathway activation by Merlin and Kibra, 
identify a subcellular domain for Hippo pathway regulation, and demonstrate differential activity 
of upstream regulators in different subcellular domains.

Merlin, Kibra, and Expanded are believed to act in a complex at intercellular junctions to control 
Hippo pathway activity. Su et al. show that instead Merlin and Kibra function at the Drosophila 
apical medial cortex separately from Crumbs and Expanded, thereby identifying an additional 
subcellular domain for Hippo pathway regulation.

INTRODUCTION

How multicellular tissues reach and maintain appropriate size is a fundamental and 
fascinating question in developmental biology. Pioneering work in Drosophila has identified 
the Hippo pathway as having a key role in regulating organ growth (Huang, et al., 2005; 
Harvey, et al., 2003; Wu, et al., 2003; Tapon, et al., 2002; Xu, et al., 1995). The Hippo 
pathway is composed of upstream activators consisting of Merlin (Mer), Expanded (Ex), 
Kibra (Kib) and Salvador (Sav), a core kinase cassette consisting of Tao1, Hippo (Hpo) and 
Warts (Wts), and a downstream transcriptional co-activator, Yorkie (Yki) (Boggiano and 
Fehon, 2012). Parallel studies in mammals have demonstrated that the components and 
overall functions of the Hippo pathway are evolutionarily conserved (Yu, et al., 2015). 
Genetic perturbation of Hippo pathway members can lead to tumorigenesis in mice (Dong, 
et al., 2007) and the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor syndrome in humans (Rouleau, et al., 
1993). Additionally, a variety of human cancers exhibit Hippo pathway deregulation 
(Harvey, et al., 2013).

A striking aspect of Hippo pathway function and regulation is its close relationship with the 
cell cortex and intercellular junctions (Enderle and McNeill, 2013; Boggiano and Fehon, 
2012). In polarized epithelia such as the Drosophila imaginal discs, the cortex and associated 
plasma membrane are organized into apical, junctional and basolateral domains (Tepass, 
2012) (Figure 1A). Hippo pathway components including Crumbs (Crb), Ex, Mer, Echinoid 
(Ed), Ajuba (Jub), Sav, Hpo and Wts have been shown to localize junctionally (Enderle and 
McNeill, 2013; Boggiano and Fehon, 2012), and recent studies indicate that the junctional 
domain is a primary site of pathway activation (Chung, et al., 2016; Sun, et al., 2015). Mer, 
Ex and Kib also are known to form a complex, colocalize at the junctions, and function 
upstream of the core kinases, suggesting that these three proteins function together to 
regulate pathway activity (Enderle and McNeill, 2013; Yu, et al., 2010). However, Mer and 
Ex localize at the cortex independent of each other and in some contexts appear to function 
in parallel genetically (Reddy and Irvine, 2011; Milton, et al., 2010; Hamaratoglu, et al., 
2006; McCartney, et al., 2000). Furthermore, both Ex and Mer can recruit Wts to the plasma 
membrane (Sun, et al., 2015; Yin, et al., 2013). Thus, despite considerable progress in 
understanding how Hippo pathway activity is regulated, we do not yet understand how these 
proteins are organized and function at the cell cortex, particularly in the context of living 
tissues.

Here we use endogenously expressed, fluorescently-tagged proteins in intact tissues to 
explore the functional relationships between upstream Hippo pathway components and the 
core kinases. We show that Mer and Kib function at the medial apical cell cortex where they 
can recruit Sav, Hpo and Wts to promote Hippo pathway activation, all independently of Ex. 
Furthermore, Mer promotes accumulation not only of Wts in this domain, but also Sav and

Hpo. Strikingly, although Crb synergizes with Ex at junctions to promote HSW pathway 
activation, Crb antagonizes Kib’s ability to restrict growth by recruiting it to the junctions. 
Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized second cortical domain for 
pathway activation, elucidate the cellular basis underlying observed genetic redundancies 
between Mer and Ex, and provide a mechanistic better understanding for how Mer, the 
product of the NF2 tumor suppressor, regulates Hippo signaling.

RESULTS

Mer, Kib and Sav colocalize at a non-junctional site

Previous studies have shown that the upstream Hippo pathway regulators Mer, Kib and Ex 
primarily localize to the junctional domain in imaginal epithelia cells (Sun, et al., 2015; 
Enderle and McNeill, 2013; Genevet, et al., 2010). However, close examination of Mer 
antibody staining shows significant non-junctional staining at the medial apical cell cortex 
(McCartney, et al., 2000; McCartney and Fehon, 1996). To assess the subcellular 
localization of endogenously expressed Mer and other Hippo pathway components in living 
tissues, we generated endogenously expressed, fluorescently tagged forms of Mer, Kib and 
Ex either using CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing (kib:GFP) or transgenes made by 
recombineering tags into genomic sequences contained within bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) clones (Mer-YFP and ex-YFP). All tagged, endogenously expressed 
proteins used in this study are fully functional, as judged by the ability to rescue null 
mutations in the corresponding genes (YFP-tagged transgenes) or homozygous viability 
(kib:GFP; data not shown).

In living wing imaginal discs, Ex-YFP appeared exclusively localized to the junctions, while 
both Mer-YFP and Kib:GFP localized both junctionally and to non-junctional punctae 
localized within the medial apical cortex (Figures 1B–1D). Using antibody staining on fixed 
tissues, we then compared the localizations of Kib and Mer and found that they normally 
colocalize both junctionally and medially (Figure 1E––1E″).

We next examined the localization of Sav, a scaffolding protein critical for recruitment and 
activation of the Hpo kinase to the signaling complex (Wu, et al., 2003). A previous study 
has reported that Sav localizes junctionally, where it interacts with the transmembrane 
protocadherin Ed (Yue, et al., 2012). We have not yet tagged Sav for imaging in live tissues, 
but published antisera recognize endogenous Sav (Yue, et al., 2012). When we co-stained 
Mer and Sav in the wing imaginal disc, we found that these proteins also co-localized both 
junctionally and medially at the apical ends of imaginal epithelial cells (Figure 1F––1F″).

To further define the specific apical domain at which these components localize, we co-
stained for Merlin and three apically-localized markers - Cad99C, a marker for apical 
microvilli (Glowinski, et al. 2014), Squash-mCherry, which localizes to the medial and 
junctional apical cortex, and Rab5-CFP, an early endosomal component. Serial optical 
sectioning of co-stained tissues revealed that the plane of maximal Merlin staining intensity 
coincides well with that of Cad99C (Figure S1A) and Squash (Figure S1C), but is apical to 
the maximal plane of Rab5-CFP (Figure S1B). These results indicate that Merlin, and by 
association Kib and Sav, localize to the apical cortex, immediately adjacent to the apical

membrane. Thus, our analysis reveals that three important Hippo pathway regulators, Kib, 
Mer and Sav, localize to the medial apical cortex, a previously unrecognized subcellular 
localization for pathway components (Figure 1G).

Kib and Mer work together to promote accumulation of Sav

The co-localization of Mer, Kib and Sav suggests the possibility that these proteins function 
together within the medial apical domain. Because Sav is recruited to the junctions through 
interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of Ed (Yue, et al., 2012), we first asked if a separate 
mechanism involving Kib and Mer recruits Sav medially. Consistent with this idea, depletion 
of both Mer and Kib by RNAi resulted in a strong reduction in medial Sav, while junctional 
Sav was largely unaffected (Figures 2A––2A″). In contrast, loss of either Mer or Kib alone 
has no detectable effect on Sav antibody staining (Figure S3A–3A‴ and S3B–S3B‴). 
These results suggest that medial Sav is recruited by Kib and Mer, and supports the idea that 
the medial apical domain might serve as a site of Hippo pathway activation.

We next asked if ectopic expression of Kib, which promotes pathway activation, also 
affected the localization and level of Mer and Sav. Ectopic expression of UAS-kib at 
moderate levels in the posterior compartment under the hedgehog-Gal4 (hhGal4) driver 
results in modest pathway activation and an undergrowth phenotype in the adult wing 
(Baumgartner, et al., 2010; Yu, et al., 2010; data not shown). In the wing imaginal disc, 
ectopically expressed Kib accumulated apically in punctae both medially and junctionally 
(Figures 2B and 2B″–2B‴), similar to endogenous Kib (Figures 1C and 1E′–1E″). In 
UAS-kib expressing cells, staining for endogenous Mer and Sav showed increased apical 
accumulation in a punctate pattern (Figures 2B––2B′ and 2C–2C′). Mer strongly 
colocalized with Kib (Figures 2B″–2B‴) and Sav (Figure 2C″–2C‴) apically, and Mer 
abundance was reduced basally (Figures S3C–S3C‴). Thus expression of Kib alone was 
sufficient to recruit both Mer and Sav to the apical domain. In contrast, ectopically expressed 
Mer or Sav does not promote accumulation of the other two proteins (data not shown).

The results presented so far suggest that Kib has a unique function in organizing pathway 
members at the apical cell cortex. To investigate the functional relationships between Kib, 
Mer and Sav, we examined the effect of removing Mer or Sav either by RNAi or in mutant 
clones in the presence of ectopically expressed Kib. We found that depleting Sav by RNAi 
does not reduce Kib-induced Mer accumulation, suggesting that Kib recruits Mer 
independently of Sav (Figures 2D, S3D–S3D″ and S3F–S3F″). In contrast, in Mer depleted 
cells, Sav accumulation was significantly reduced but still modestly higher than in wild-type 
cells, suggesting that Mer promotes the ability of Kib to recruit Sav (Figures 2E, S3E–S3E″ 
and S3G–S3G″). This result is consistent with a previous study showing that loss of Mer 
suppresses the effect of ectopic Kib expression on growth in the eye (Baumgartner, et al., 
2010) and the wing (data not shown).

Mer and Kib promote apical accumulation and activation of Hpo in a Sav-dependent 
manner

The data presented suggest the possibility of a second site of Hippo pathway activation in 
the medial apical domain that is regulated by Kib, Mer and Sav. If so, then we predict that

the downstream kinases, in particular Hpo and Wts, should also be recruited medially. To 
investigate the potential involvement of Hpo, we generated a YFP-tagged, hpo transgene 
expressed under its endogenous promoter and polyclonal anti-Hpo antisera. Consistent with 
a previous report using antibody staining (Sun, et al., 2015), Hpo-YFP showed a mostly 
cytoplasmic localization with weak accumulation across the apical cortex (Figure S4A). In 
live wing imaginal cells that ectopically expressed Kib, Hpo-YFP accumulated apically 
(Figure 3A––3A″) in a punctate pattern similar to that we observed for Mer and Sav 
(Figures 2C––2C‴). In fixed tissues stained for Hpo, Kib and E-cad, we found that Kib and 
Hpo strongly co-localized at both medially and junctionally (Figure 3B––3B‴). In addition, 
staining with anti-phospho Mst1/2 showed that the accumulated Hpo was active (Figure 
3C––3C‴).

To examine how Hpo-YFP is recruited into Kib punctae, we used RNAi to deplete other 
pathway components in live wing epithelial cells and examined the effects on Kib-promoted 
Hpo-YFP accumulation. The efficiency of the RNAi lines was confirmed by testing their 
ability to deplete endogenously expressed proteins (Figures S4B, S4C and S2B). Consistent 
with Sav’s known role to bind Hpo directly (Wu, et al., 2003), depletion of Sav by RNAi 
abolished Kib-induced Hpo-YFP accumulation (Figures 3D and S5A–S5A″). In addition, 
we found that depletion of Mer also significantly reduced Hpo recruitment by Kib, assayed 
by either Hpo-YFP in live tissues (Figures 3D and S5B–S5B″) or anti-Hpo staining (Figures 
S5D–S5D‴). This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that Mer, Sav and 
Hpo form a complex in S2 cells (Reddy and Irvine, 2011; Yu, et al., 2010). To rule out the 
possibility that the residual Hpo accumulation is due to incomplete removal of Mer by 
RNAi, Mer4 null mutant clones were generated in the background of nub-Gal4-driven 
ectopic expression of UAS-kib in the wing pouch region. Consistent with the RNAi 
experiments, apical Hpo-YFP was reduced but still modestly accumulated in Mer4 mutant 
cells that ectopically expressed Kib (Figure S5E–S5E′). Thus Mer promotes, but is not 
required for Sav’s ability to recruit Hpo in concert with Kib. This observation is consistent 
with previous genetic studies showing that while loss of Mer suppresses the effects ectopic 
Kib expression with respect to growth in the eye, the Mer; kib double mutant phenotype is 
stronger than either single mutant alone (Baumgartner, et al., 2010; Yu, et al., 2010).

To ensure that the ability of Kib and Mer to assemble pathway components is not dependent 
on ectopic expression, we used RNAi to deplete these proteins and examined endogenously 
expressed Hpo-YFP in the wing epithelium, which as indicated previously is diffusely 
enriched in the apical domain and does not display pronounced medial or junctional 
accumulation (Figure S4A). As expected, removal of Sav severely reduced Hpo-YFP 
apically (Figure 3E, 3G––3G′). Additionally, simultaneous depletion of both Kib and Mer 
also significantly reduced Hpo-YFP levels in the apical domain (Figures 3E, 3F––3F″). 
Taken together, these gain and loss of function results indicate that Kib and Mer work 
together to promote apical accumulation and activation of Hpo in a Sav-dependent manner.

Mer, Kib and Sav function independently of Ex

Previous studies have suggested that Mer, Kib and Ex function as a complex (Enderle and 
McNeill, 2013; Genevet, et al., 2010; Yu, et al., 2010), and Ex has been proposed to be a key

upstream regulator of Hippo pathway activation (Sun, et al., 2015). Therefore, we next asked 
if ectopic Kib expression had a similar effect on Ex as we observed for Mer. In marked 
contrast to Mer and Sav, we did not observe recruitment of Ex to the medial apical domain 
by ectopic Kib expression. Indeed, neither the abundance nor localization of endogenous Ex 
was noticeably altered (Figures 4A––4A‴; Figure S6A–6A″). This suggests that Kib 
assembles Mer and Sav independently of Ex, though we did note that Kib at the junctions 
colocalized with Ex (Figure 4A‴).

To confirm that Kib can assemble other upstream components medially independently of Ex, 
and to explore the relationship between Ex and Kib at the junctions, we ectopically 
expressed Kib in ex null clones using mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker 
(MARCM) (Lee and Luo, 1999). Kib apical localization, either medially or junctionally, was 
unchanged in the absence of Ex (Figures 4B––4B‴). Furthermore, Kib-induced apical 
accumulation of Mer and Sav was unaffected by loss of Ex (Figures 4C––4C‴). We next 
asked if Ex is required for accumulation and activation of Hpo in cells that ectopically 
express Kib. Ex depletion by RNAi did not significantly affect either apical Hpo level as 
assayed by Hpo-YFP or anti-Hpo (Figures 3D, 4D––4D‴ and S5C–S5C″) or anti-phospho 
Mst1/2 staining (Figure S6B–S6B″). Taken together, these results indicate that Kib 
promotes assembly and activation of Hippo pathway components medially, independent of 
and spatially distinct from Ex.

To further examine functional interactions between kib, Mer, and ex, we tested the effects of 
ectopic kib expression on growth in normal or ex deficient tissues. We found that UAS-kib 
expression in the wing suppressed the overgrowth phenotype due to ex depletion to near 
wild-type (Figures 4E–4F and S6C–S6E). This result is consistent with our molecular 
observation that Kib can promote accumulation and activation of Hpo in wing epithelial 
cells in the absence of Ex.

Kib recruits Wts in a Mer-dependent manner

If Kib organizes Mer, Sav and Hpo medially into sites of Hippo signaling, then we expect 
that Wts, which acts downstream of Hpo, should also be recruited there. In imaginal 
epithelial cells, most endogenous Wts is tethered by Jub at the adherens junction, spatially 
segregated from other pathway components (Sun, et al., 2015; Rauskolb, et al., 2014). To 
maximize our ability to detect whether Wts is recruited medially by Kib, we examined a 
GFP-tagged version of Wts expressed under its endogenous promoter (Rauskolb, et al., 
2014) in the background of UAS-kib driven by hhGal4. Using live imaging of the wing 
imaginal disc, we observed that Wts accumulated medially in Kib expressing cells (Figures 
5A––5A′).

Previous studies have shown that both Ex and Mer are capable of recruiting Wts to the cell 
cortex (Sun, et al., 2015; Yin, et al., 2013). To determine the role of these proteins in the 
medial apical domain, we depleted each protein using UAS-RNAi transgenes in the 
background of UAS-kib and hhGal4. While depletion of Mer prevented Wts accumulation 
medially, depletion of Ex had no observable effect (Figures 5B––5B′ and 5C–5C′). Neither 
manipulation affected junctional Wts.

Crumbs sequesters Kibra junctionally to repress its function in growth control

To this point, we have focused on Kibra function in the medial apical domain. However, in 
living tissues we observed a significant fraction of Kib localized to the junctions, raising the 
questions 1) how does Kib localize there, and 2) does it function there? Previous 
biochemical studies have shown that Kib interacts with both Mer and Ex (Genevet, et al., 
2010; Yu, et al., 2010), so we asked whether loss of either gene affects localization of 
endogenously expressed Kib:GFP in living tissues. Although we found that Kib is up-
regulated in both Mer and ex mutant clones, Kib localization did not change noticeably in 
either mutant background (Figures S7A–S7B). Additionally, simultaneous depletion of both 
Mer and Ex had no effect on Kib:GFP localization (data not shown), suggesting that another 
mechanism is responsible for Kib’s junctional localization.

The transmembrane protein Crb is known to function upstream in Hippo signaling, at least 
in part by regulating stability and localization of Ex (Zhang, et al., 2015; Ribeiro, et al., 
2014; Chen, et al., 2010; Ling, et al., 2010; Robinson, et al., 2010) (Figures S7C and S7E–
S7E′). Crb is also strongly junctionally localized, so we wondered if Crb might promote Kib 
junctional localization. Depletion of Crb by RNAi severely disrupted the junctional 
localization of Kib:GFP in wing epithelium, resulting in accumulation of Kib punctae 
primarily at the AMR (Figures 6A––6A′, 6B–6B″). Basal Kib levels were unaffected 
(Figure S7D), suggesting Kib was retained at the apical cortex. In contrast, Crb depletion 
results in basal mislocalization of Ex (Chen, et al., 2010; Ling, et al., 2010) (Figures S7D–
S7D′).

The Crb intracellular domain has two short motifs, the juxtamembrane FERM-binding motif 
(FBM) and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Ex binds the FBM and is 
mislocalized basally in mitotic clones homozygous for a crb allele in which the FBM is 
deleted (Ling, et al., 2010). Using MARCM, we ectopically expressed Kib in either crb null 
or crbΔFBM  mutant cells. Ectopically expressed Kib was strongly medially localized in crb 
null clones (Figures 6C––6C‴ and 6D–6D‴), similar to our observations for endogenous 
Kib:GFP. In contrast, Kib localization was unchanged compared to controls in crbΔFBM  cells 
(Figures 6C––6C‴ and 6E–6E‴). Thus junctional localization of Kib is dependent upon 
Crb, but does not require the FERM binding domain of Crb. We could not ask if the PDZ-
binding motif is needed for proper Kib localization because Crb lacking this domain did not 
localize junctionally (Figure S7F–S7F′ and S7G–S7G′).

If Kib functions at the medial apical domain, then we predict that loss of Crb, which causes 
strong medial localization of Kib, should promote Kib-dependent pathway activity. To test 
this, we compared the effect of ectopic Kib expression alone to its effect when Crb was 
simultaneously depleted by RNAi. Loss of Crb alone results in a modest overgrowth 
phenotype in the wing, while ectopic expression of either Kib or Ex causes a mild 
undergrowth phenotype (Figures 7A–7B). These observations suggest that all three proteins 
function synergistically with respect to growth. Consistent with the idea that Crb promotes 
Ex function, Crb depletion strongly suppressed the undergrowth phenotype caused by 
ectopic Ex expression (Figures 7A–7B). In marked contrast, Crb depletion enhanced the 
undergrowth phenotype caused by ectopic Kib expression (Figures 7A–7B), indicating that 
crb genetically antagonizes kib function. To ask if these effects on growth are due to Hippo

pathway activation, we generated a YFP-tagged version of Yki expressed under its 
endogenous promoter (Yki-YFP) and used it as a biosensor for pathway activity. Depletion 
of Wts resulted in strong nuclear re-localization of Yki-YFP (Figure S7H–S7H″), 
demonstrating that Yki-YFP is a functional biosensor for pathway activity. Although ectopic 
Kib expression alone did not have a detectable effect on Yki subcellular localization, 
depletion of Crb by RNAi caused Yki-YFP to become more nuclear. In contrast, 
simultaneous depletion of Crb by RNAi and ectopic Kib expression resulted in decreased 
Yki nuclear accumulation (Figure 7C). Taken together, our observations are consistent with 
the idea that Kib promotes Hippo signaling medially, and that Crb represses Kib activity by 
sequestering it at the junctions. We speculate that in loss of Crb alone, increased Kib activity 
is counterbalanced by decreased Ex function, with the net result being an overall slightly 
overgrown phenotype.

DISCUSSION

To address the question of how the upstream Hippo pathway components Kib, Mer and Ex 
regulate pathway activity, we examined their functional interactions in the imaginal 
epithelium using endogenously expressed, tagged proteins in both fixed and living tissues. 
Our results identify a cellular domain for Hippo pathway activation (Figure 7D), the non-
junctional, medial region of the apical cell cortex. We also show that Kib, together with Mer 
and Sav, function at this site to organize the core kinases Hpo and Wts to promote pathway 
activity. Hippo signaling at the medial apical domain occurs independently of Ex, which 
localizes at the junctional cortex together with Crb. Additionally, we have discovered that 
Kib’s ability to promote pathway activity is repressed by Crb. Together these studies reveal 
the existence of parallel, spatially distinct signaling mechanisms that together regulate Hippo 
pathway output and tissue growth. The discovery of these distinct signaling domains is 
consistent with and explains previous genetic studies showing that Mer and Kib function in 
parallel to Crb and Ex (McCartney et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2010).

A striking aspect of our findings is they reveal a novel role for Crb in regulating Hippo 
pathway activity. Previous studies have shown two opposing Crb functions with respect to 
Ex and tissue growth: 1) Crb promotes Ex function by recruiting Ex to the junctional domain 
where it can assemble and activate Hippo pathway components, and 2) Crb represses Ex 
function by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation (Zhang, et al., 2015; Ribeiro, et al., 
2014; Chen, et al., 2010; Ling, et al., 2010; Robinson, et al., 2010). Surprisingly, our results 
indicate that Crb also promotes growth by repressing Kib function, possibly by sequestering 
it away from the medial apical domain. These results highlight Crb as a key regulator of 
pathway output that may serve as a nexus for crosstalk between Kib- and Ex-mediated 
parallel upstream inputs, and raise the intriguing question of how these different functions of 
Crb might be regulated. They also raise the question of how Kib activity is regulated by Crb 
at the junctional domain. Previous studies have demonstrated molecular interactions between 
Crb and Ex (Ling et al. 2010), and between Ex, Kib and Mer (Yu et al. 2010; Genevet et al. 
2010; Baumgartner et al. 2010), suggesting that Crb might regulate Kib through Ex. 
However, our observations that depletion of Ex suppresses the UAS-kib phenotype while 
depletion of Crb enhances UAS-kib argues strongly that the functional interaction between 
Crb and Kib is not mediated by Ex or other downstream components.

Our findings also highlight the question of why there are two mechanisms, one mediated by 
Ex at the junctions and a second organized medially by Kib and Mer, for controlling Hippo 
pathway output. In some cases these apparently parallel inputs might reflect tissue specific 
differences (Reddy and Irvine, 2011; Milton, et al., 2010). However, in the wing imaginal 
epithelium, a tissue in which Hippo signaling has been extensively characterized, both 
mechanisms clearly operate in parallel in the same cells. At the moment, we understand very 
little about the external cues that regulate key upstream pathway components such as Kib 
and Ex, although recent studies on Hippo signaling have revealed the importance of tension 
in regulating pathway output. In Drosophila, previous studies have demonstrated tension-
sensing mechanisms localized to the junctional domain that regulate Hippo pathway activity 
(Leckband and de Rooij, 2014; Rauskolb, et al., 2014). Junctional mechanisms are ideally 
positioned to detect forces exerted across fields of cells in tissues. However, recent studies 
have shown that intracellular contractile forces, such as those that mediate apical 
constriction during tissue morphogenesis, are generated by networks of actomyosin 
contractile bundles that localize within the medial apical cortex (Levayer, et al., 2011; 
Martin, et al., 2009). One intriguing possibility raised by our discovery that Kib and Mer 
function in the same apical domain is that their output is sensitive to intracellularly 
generated cortical tension. The ability to sense tension in individual cells during tissue 
morphogenesis – such as the formation of epithelial folds – could be critical to coordinate 
cell shape changes and cell division during development.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

Drosophila melanogaster was cultured using standard techniques at 25°C (unless otherwise 
noted). Both male and female animals were used, except that females were used for studies 
in which wing size was measured.

METHOD DETAILS

Drosophila Genetics—For expression of UAS lines, the following drivers were used: hh-
Gal4, ap-Gal4, and nub-Gal4. The UAS lines used in this study are listed in Key Resources 
table.

To generate endogenously expressed, fluorescent protein forms of Mer, Ex and Hpo, YFP 
tags were inserted into genomic BAC clones encompassing the entire Mer, ex and Hpo genes 
using recombineering (details provided upon request). Transgenes of these tagged genomic 
constructs were then generated at the VK37 (22A3, chromosome 2L) and VK1 (59D3, 
chromosome 2R) landing sites using phiC31 integration (Ludwig, et al., 2011). Each 
transgene rescues the lethality of corresponding null alleles, indicating that the tags do not 
interfere with normal function (data not shown). C-terminally GFP-tagged Kibra was 
generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. A plasmid including a 993 bp left homology

arm fused in-frame to GFP and followed by a 1001 bp right homology arm inserted into 
pBlueScript was used as the donor template. This plasmid was co-injected with a pU6-Bbs1-
chiRNA based plasmid expressing the guide RNA (5′-
TACCAGCACCAGTTGTAACTCC-3′) into vas-Cas9 embryos. The resulting allele, 
kib:GFP, is homozygous viable indicating it is fully functional.

To generate mutant clones or MARCM clones, the following genotypes were used:

Mer clones:

y w hsflp Ubi-RFP FRT19A/Mer4 FRT19A; kib:GFP/+

y w hsflp Ubi-RFP FRT19A/Mer4 FRT19A; nub-Gal4, Hpo-YFP/+; UAS-kib/+

ex clones:

exe1 FRT40/Ubi-RFP FRT40; hsflp, Sb/kib:GFP

y w hsflp tub-Gal4 UAS-GFP/+/Y; exe1 FRT40/tubGal80 FRT40; UAS-kib/+

sav clones:

y w hsflp/+/Y; nub-Gal4/UAS-kib; FRT 82B sav3/FRT 82B Ubi-RFP

crb clones:

y w hsflp UAS-GFP/+/Y; UAS-kib/+; FRT 82B/FRT 82B tub-Gal80

y w hsflp UAS-GFP/+/Y; UAS-kib/+; FRT 82B crb1/FRT 82B tub-Gal80

y w hsflp UAS-GFP/+/Y; UAS-kib/+; FRT 82B crb ΔFBM /FRT 82B tub-Gal80

Immunostaining and Imaging—Wing imaginal discs from late third instar larvae were 
fixed and stained as previously described (McCartney and Fehon, 1996). Primary antibodies, 
listed in Key Resources table, were diluted as follows: anti-Kib (1:2000), anti-Sav (1:2000), 
anti-Ex (1:5000) anti-Mer (1:10000), anti-E-cad (1:1000), anti-Crb (1:1000), anti-pMst1/2 
(1:2000) and anti-Cad99c (1:1000). For anti-Crb staining, dissected imaginal discs were 
treated with methanol for 5 min following fixation. Secondary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) 
were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Immunostaining samples were imaged 
using either a Zeiss LSM 510 or LSM 880 confocal microscope and the images were 
analyzed with Image J.

Wing growth assessment—For assessment of wing growth, adult female wings were 
mounted in methyl salicylate and photographed with the same settings on a Zeiss Axioplan 
microscope using a Canon camera (EOS rebel T2i). Subsequent measurements of wing size 
and statistical analyses were processed using Image J and Graphpad Prism, respectively.

Live Imaging—For live imaging, freshly dissected wing discs from third instar larvae were 
mounted in a glass bottom petri dish (MatTeK Corporation, Part No.: P35G-1.5-14-C) and 
cultured in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. 
The mounted samples were immediately imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Image J was used to quantify mean fluorescence intensity in selected regions of the posterior 
and anterior compartment in Figures 2D–2E and 3D–3E, and Graphpad Prism was then used 
to perform statistical analysis. A nonparametric Mann Whitney test was used in Figures 2D–
2E. A one-way ANOVA test was used in Figures 3D–3E, 4F and 7B. Statistical significance 
of results between compared groups was indicated as follows: **** (p ≤ 0.0001), *** (p ≤ 
0.001), ns (p > 0.05).

Figure 2. Kib and Mer work together to promote accumulation of Sav at the medial apical 
domain
(A–A‴) Sav localization in the wing epithelium expressing both UAS-Mer-RNAi and UAS-
kib-RNAi in the posterior compartment under hh-Gal4 (dashed line indicates anterior-
posterior compartment boundary). Anti-E-cad staining (not shown) was used to mark the 
junctions and generate a binary mask to remove junctional Sav from the image (compare 
Savtotal in A to Savmedial in A′). Note that while total Sav staining is not strongly affected by 
reduction of Mer and Kib, Savmedial is dramatically reduced. High magnification insets of 
anterior (wild-type; ROI 1) in A″ and posterior (Mer-RNAi, kib-RNAi; ROI 2) in A‴ cells 
show loss of medial Sav in Kib/Mer depleted cells.

(B–C) Kib expression enhances Mer and Sav abundance apically. Co-staining of wing disc 
epithelial cells expressing UAS-kib in the posterior compartment under hh-Gal4 with anti-
Kib, anti-Mer and anti-Ecad (B-B‴), and with anti-Mer, anti-Sav and anti-Ecad (C–C‴). 
The composite images indicate co-localization of Kib and Mer (B′–B‴) or Mer and Sav (C
′–C‴) at the junctions (yellow arrows) and medially (white arrows).
(D) Increased Mer staining promoted by expression of UAS-kib under hh-Gal4 is not 
affected by Sav depletion by RNAi. Scatter plots show that the level of Mer staining between 
posterior (hh-Gal4) and anterior (wild-type) cells (P/A Ratio) is unchanged in discs 
expressing UAS-kib alone or UAS-kib and UAS-sav-RNAi. Representative images are 
shown in Figures 2C––2C′ and S1B–S1B′, respectively.
(E) Depletion of Mer reduces but does not eliminate Kib-induced recruitment of apical Sav. 
Representative images are shown in Figures 2C––2C′ and S1C–S1C′.
The number of samples for each group is indicated. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. 
Asterisks represent statistical significance of difference between selected groups (see STAR 
Methods). ns: not significant.

Figure 3. Kib, Mer and Sav together promote apical accumulation and activation of Hpo
(A–A″) Kib, expressed in the posterior compartment of a living wing disc, induces 
accumulation of Hpo-YFP apically. RFP expression, driven by hh-Gal4, marks the posterior 
compartment.
(B–B‴) Co-staining of anti-Hpo, anti-Kib and anti-E-cad in the wing epithelium expressing 
UAS-kib under hh-Gal4. There is strong co-localization between Hpo and Kib. Cross-
section (X-Z) views of Kib and Hpo staining show apical accumulation (apical is up). 
Yellow and white arrows in the inset indicate junctional and medial localization, 
respectively.

(C–C‴) Hpo recruited by ectopically expressed Kib is active. Anti-phospho-Mst1/2 and 
anti-Ecad staining of the wing epithelium expressing UAS-kib under hh-Gal4 shows strong 
accumulation of phospho-Hpo medially.
(D) Scatter plots (mean ± SEM) showing P/A ratio of apical Hpo-YFP in discs expressing 
RFP (control), or UAS-kib and RNAi transgenes for Mer, ex or sav as indicated. Although 
depletion of either Mer or Sav reduced Kib-induced accumulation of Hpo-YFP, depletion of 
Ex had no effect. Representative images of these genotypes are presented in Figures S5.
(E–G) Depletion of Kib and Mer reduces the level of apically localized Hpo-YFP in living 
tissues. Scatter plots show the P/A ratio of apical Hpo-YFP abundance in discs of the 
indicated genotypes (E). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Representative images are 
shown in F–G′. Hpo-YFP abundance was reduced in the posterior compartment, marked by 
the expression of RFP, either by simultaneous depletion of Kib and Mer (F–F′) or depletion 
of Sav alone (G–G′).

(A–A‴) Kib expression does not obviously affect Ex abundance or localization. Co-staining 
of anti-Kib, anti-Ex and anti-Ecad in the wing epithelium expressing UAS-kib under hh-
Gal4. High magnification inset shows that Kib and Ex co-localize at the junctions (yellow 
arrows). Note that there is no observable Ex staining medially.
(B–D) The organization of punctate structures containing Kib (B–B‴), Mer (C–C‴), Sav 
(C–C‴) and Hpo (D–D‴) is not affected by loss of Ex. ex mutant clones that expressed

(E–F) Kib and Ex have additive effects with respect to growth of the wing imaginal disc. 
MARCM clones (marked by the presence of GFP) of the indicated genotypes were induced 
using hsFlp expression (E). Ectopic Kib expression suppressed the overgrowth phenotype of 
ex null clones. Scatter plots show clone area (marked by GFP) relative to the entire wing 
imaginal disc (marked by DAPI) for the indicated clone genotypes (F). The number of

Figure 5. Kib recruits Wts to the medial domain in a Mer-dependent manner
(A–C) GFP-wts in wing discs expressing UAS-kib alone, or together with UAS-Mer-RNAi 
or ex-RNAi as indicated under the hh-Gal4 driver. GFP-Wts accumulated medially (white 
arrows) with ectopic Kib expression (A–A′). While medial GFP-Wts accumulation was 
suppressed by depletion of Mer (B–B′), medial GFP-Wts accumulation was unaffected by 
Ex depletion (C–C′).

Figure 6. Crb tethers Kib junctionally
(A–B′) Crb is required to localize Kib at the junctions. In live wing discs, endogenously 
expressed Kib:GFP is predominantly junctional with some medial staining in wild type cells 
(ventral compartment, V). However, when Crb is depleted in dorsal (D) cells using ap>crb-
RNAi, the junctional appearance of Kib:GFP is lost (A–A′). Co-staining with anti-Ecad 
shows that when Crb is depleted in the dorsal compartment, Kib:GFP becomes primarily 
medial (B–B′). The dashed white line marks the approximate D/V boundary.
(C–E‴) The FERM binding domain in Crb is not required for Kib junctional localization. 
Wing epithelial cells containing GFP-marked MARCM clones ectopically expressing Kib 
alone (C–C‴) (control), in a crb1 null clone (D–D‴), or a crbΔFBM  clone (E–E‴).

Figure 7. Crb represses Kib’s function in growth control
(A–B) Crb promotes Ex function but antagonizes Kib. Adult wings from flies with the 
indicated UAS transgenes under the control of nub-Gal4 driver (A). While depleting Crb by 
RNAi suppresses the undergrowth caused by ectopic Ex expression, it enhances the 
undergrowth phenotype of ectopic Kib expression. (B) Scatter plots quantifying wing area 
for the genotypes shown in A. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
(C) A biosensor for Hippo pathway activity, endogenously expressed Yki-YFP, shows that 
Crb regulates Kib activity in growth control via Hippo pathway activity. As expected from 
its overgrowth phenotype, depletion of Crb results in greater nuclear localization of Yki-
YFP, as evidenced by less obvious dark nuclear ‘holes’ in the posterior compartment where 
hh-Gal4 is expressed. Kib expression alone has little or no detectable effect on Yorkie 
subcellular (nuclear) localization. In contrast, expressing Kib and simultaneously depleting 
of Crb results in decreased Yki-YFP nuclear accumulation, indicating increased upstream 
pathway activation.

(D) A working model for upstream activation of Hippo signaling. We propose that the Hippo 
signaling occurs at two different cortical sites. The first is organized by Ex at the marginal 
zone (MZ), as proposed previously (Sun et al., 2015). We demonstrate a second site at the 
medial apical domain where Kib, together with Mer and Sav, promote pathway activity 
independently of Ex. Crb represses Kib function by sequestering it to the junctions. The 
indicated protein associations and functional relationships are based on published literature 
and the results of this study.
