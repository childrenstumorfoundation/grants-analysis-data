Abstract: To bring insights into neurofibroma biochemistry, a comprehensive secretome 
analysis was performed on cultured human primary Schwann cells isolated from surgically 
resected  plexiform  neurofibroma  and  from  normal  nerve  tissue.  Using  a  combination  of 
SDS-PAGE and high precision LC-MS/MS, 907 proteins were confidently identified in the 
conditioned  media  of  Schwann  cell  cultures  combined.  Label  free  proteome  profiling 
revealed consistent release of high levels of 22 proteins by the four biological replicates of 
NF1 Schwann cell cultures relative to the two normal Schwann cell cultures. Inversely, 9 
proteins  displayed  decreased  levels  in  the  conditioned  media  of  NF1  relative  to  normal 
Schwann  cells.  The  proteins  with  increased  levels  included  proteins  involved  in  cell 
growth,  angiogenesis  and  complement  pathway  while  proteins  with  decreased  levels 
included  those  involved  in  cell  adhesion,  plasminogen  pathway  and  extracellular  matrix 
remodeling. Retinoic acid receptor responder protein-1 (RARRES1), previously described 
as  an  integral  membrane  tumor  suppressor,  was  found  exclusively  secreted  by  NF1 
Schwann  cells  but  not  by  normal  Schwann  cells.  All-trans  retinoic  acid  modulated 
secretion of RARRES1 in a dose dependent manner. This study shows altered secretion of

key proteins in NF1 derived Schwann cells. The potential implication of these proteins in 
neurofibroma biology is discussed.

1. Introduction 

Plexiform neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors affecting 26 to 30% of patients 
diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) [1]. They are often present as large peripheral nerve 
neoplasms  affecting  the  head,  neck  and/or  lower  back  [2].  They  are  ultimately  composed  of 
uncharacterized cell type of the Schwann cell lineage origin intertwined with fibroblasts, mast cells 
and endothelial cells [3]. Though benign, these peripheral nerve tumors can be clinically debilitating 
depending on their size, location and infiltrative nature [4]. Furthermore, individuals with plexiform 
neurofibroma are at risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which are 
more challenging to treat. The only effective treatment available today for plexiform neurofibroma is 
surgical  resection  [4,5].  Unfortunately,  depending  on  the  location  and  the  infiltrative  nature  of  the 
tumor  masses,  complete  surgical  resection  remains  a  challenge  often  leading  to  recurrence  of  even 
larger tumor masses causing pain, disfigurement and physical impairment [5,6]. 

It  is  suggested  that  plexiform  neurofibroma  arise  from  Schwann  cells  that  undergo  loss  of 
heterozygosity at the NF1 locus [7]. Schwann cells are of neural crest origin and play an important role 
in the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system [8]. They are involved in the 
myelination and insulation of neuronal axons as well as in the regeneration and trophic support for 
neurons. During the course of NF1 pathogenesis Schwann cells undergo biallelic inactivation at the 
NF1 locus leading to somatic inactivation of NF1 gene that encode for neurofibromine-1 protein, a 
physiological inhibitor of the Ras pathway [1,9]. This results in hyper-activation of the Ras pathway 
and uncontrolled proliferation of Schwann cells. 

Agents targeting the Ras pathway and kinase pathways showed promise in inhibiting neurofibroma 
progression in vitro and in mouse models [10]. Unfortunately, these same agents had little to no impact 
on  patients  with  progressive  plexiform  neurofibroma  indicating  that  Ras  pathway  alone  does  not 
account for the plexiform neurofibroma progression [11].  

Recent  studies  suggested  involvement  of  the  cell  microenvironment  and  cell-cell  interaction  in 
neurofibroma  progression  [12,13].  Proteins  secreted  by  both  Schwann  cells  and  mast  cells  might 
contribute  to  the  uncontrolled  growth  of  neurofibroma.  Thus,  a  comprehensive  study  of  secreted 
proteins  or  “secretome”  of  the  implicated  cells  might  be  an  attractive  approach  for  identifying 
components that might bring insight into the molecular pathogenesis of NF1.  

In this study, we first sought to define the secretome of primary Schwann cell cultures derived from 
surgically  resected  plexiform  neurofibroma.  We  used  a  label  free  proteome  profiling  strategy  to 
systematically  compare  secretomes  of  four  plexiform  neurofibroma  Schwann  cell  cultures  to  the 
secretome  of  normal  Schwann  cells  derived  from  non-neoplastic  peripheral  nerve.  This  survey 
identified  aberrant  release  of  several  key  proteins  by  the  plexiform  neurofibroma  Schwann  cells 

 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 
relative  to  the  normal  Schwann  cells.  Retinoic  acid  receptor  responder  protein  1  (RARRES1)  also 
known as Tazarotene-induced gene (TIG1) was exclusively released by the plexiform neurofibroma 
Schwann cells and not by normal Schwann cells derived from non-noeplastic peripheral nerve.

Identifying  altered  protein  secretion  by  neurofiboma  Schwann  cells  might  shed  light  into  the 
mechanism  of  neurofibroma  progression  and  eventually  define  novel  therapeutic  targets  for  NF1 
patients suffering from recurrent plexiform neurofibroma. 

2. Results and Discussion 

2.1. Primary Schwann Cell Isolation and Culture  

NFSC141, NFSC142, NFSC143R and NFSC143L primary Schwann cells cultures were established 
from  plexiform  neurofibroma  surgically  resected  from  three  different  patients  admitted  at  CNMC. 
NFSC143R and NFSC143L were established from tumors removed from the right and left lumbar of 
the  same  patient.  Table  1  summarizes  the  age,  gender  and  tumor  location  of  the  participating  NF1 
patients.  All  three  patients  were  diagnosed  with  a  plexiform  type  of  neurofibroma  according  to  the 
pathology  results.  Established  Schwann  cell  cultures  from  these  specimens  showed  highly 
homogenous cell population. All NF1 Schwann cultures resembled the normal Schwann cell culture 
and expressed the characteristic Schwann cell marker S100β (Figure 1). The isolated cells were further 
subcultured  to  passage  2  and  processed  for  secretome  profiling  and  Western  blot  analysis  and  the 
results are described below.

2.2. Secretome Profiling 

Secretome profiles of the four plexiform neurofibroma Schwann cell cultures NFSC141, NFSC142, 
NFSC143R  and  NFSC143L  and  the  two  normal  primary  human  Schwann  cell  cultures  NSC1  and 
NSC2 were obtained as described in the method using a combination of SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion 
and high precision LC-MS/MS. We confidently identified and quantified 907 proteins in the CM of the 
four  NF1  Schwann  cell  cultures  and  the  two  normal  Schwann  cell  cultures  combined  (see 
Supplemental  Table  1).  Only  proteins  that  were  identified  by  at  least  two  unique  peptides  and 
probability based score p value < 0.001 were retained for further analysis. In general Schwann cells 
were found to secrete a variety of extracellular matrix remodeling proteins, complement components, 
cell growth regulating proteins, cell adhesion and cell migration promoting proteins.

Schwann  cell  media.  (a)  Normal  Schwann  cells;  (b)  Schwann  cells  isolated  from  a 
plexiform  neurofibroma  of  a  20  year  old  female  donor  (NFSC  141).  Both  cells  were 
immuno-stained  against  the  Schwann  cell  marker  S100β  protein  shown  in  red  and  the 
nuclei with DAPI shown in blue. 

 

For  quantitative  comparisons  we  used  ProteoIQ  software  to  compare  spectral  counts  and  signal 
intensities generated from peptides belonging to each protein across all the samples analyzed. Several 
proteins were found uniquely secreted by NF1 Schwann cells and not by the normal Schwann cells and 
vice  versa.  Among  these  differentially  secreted  proteins,  12  were  exclusively  secreted  by  the  four  
NF1 Schwann cell cultures and not by the normal Schwann cells, while 4 were exclusively secreted by 
the normal Schwann cells but not by any of the NF1 Schwann cell cultures. These proteins are reported 
in  Table  2  with  their  spectral  count,  subcellular  localization  and  potential  function.  NF1  Schwann  
cells  secreted  significant  amounts  of  complement  components  C3  and  C4-A,  retinoic  acid  receptor 
responder  protein1  (RARRES1),  apolipoproteins  D  and  E,  Chitinase-3  like  protein  and  glutathione 
peroxidase  3.  The  RARRES1  protein  was  among  the  most  abundant  proteins  in  this  category  
with  average  spectral  counts  of  45  versus  0  in  the  CM  of  NF1  Schwann  cells  relative  to  normal 
Schwann cells.

Other  proteins  were  secreted  by  both  NF1  and  normal  Schwann  cells  but  in  different  amounts. 
Secretion of 7 proteins were found to be increased by at least 3 fold with p value ≤ 0.05 while 6 were 
found to be decreased by at least the same factor and p value cut off in CM of NF1 Schwann cells 
relative to normal Schwann cells. These proteins are reported in Table 3 with their spectral counts, 
subcellular localization and potential function.  

Overall, plexiform neurofibroma Schwann cells released greater amounts of cell adhesion proteins 
such  as  laminin  alpha  4,  nidogen-2,  cell  growth  regulating  factors  such  as  target  of  Nesh-SH3,  
EGF-containing  fibulin-like  extracellular  matrix  protein  1  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  binding 
proteins while dramatically decreased the release of receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase kappa, a 
negative regulator of EGFR signaling as well as, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), chondroitin 
sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), and integrin beta-1.

The  altered  secretome  signature  in  NF1  Schwann  cells  relative  to  normal  Schwann  cells  was 
maintained  in  the  commercially  available  sNF96.2  cell  line  established  from  a  malignant  peripheral 
nerve  sheath  tumor  that  was  surgically  resected  from  a  27  year  old  donor  five  years  ago  [14]  (see 
supplemental  Table).  Several  proteins  that  were  elevated  or  decreased  in  the  CM  of  NF1  Schwann 
cells relative to normal Schwann cells maintained the same expression direction in the CM of sNF96.2 
cells relative to normal Schwann cells. These include the RARRES1 protein, Complements, chitinase 
3-like protein, alpha fetoprotein, cadherin-6 etc. (see supplemental Table) 

2.3. Characterization of Schwann Cell Secreted RARRES1 Protein 

An earlier study described RARRES1 protein as a 33 kDa single pass trans-membrane protein with 
a short N-terminal cytosolic domain, a transmembrane domain and a large C-terminal [15]. The secreted 
RARRES1  was  identified  by  12  unique  tryptic  peptides  in  SDS-PAGE  bands  ranging  from  80  to  

 

9386 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 
160  kDa  with  higher  concentration  around  110  kDa.  This  apparent  mass  is  much  higher  than  the 
expected  38–40  kDa  molecular  mass  reported  for  the  cell  attached  RARRES1  protein  [15,16].  The 
commercially available sNF96.2 Schwann cell line established from MPNST also secreted similar high 
molecular  mass  RARRES1  protein.  The  sequences  of  the  detected  peptides  for  the  extracellular 
RARRES1  and  their  position  in  the  protein  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  observed  masses  for  these 
peptides were within 10 ppm accuracy with confidence identification better than 99%. All 12 peptides 
belonged  to  the  C-terminal  extracellular  domain  of  the  protein  suggesting  possible  shedding  of 
RARRES1  from  NF1  Schwann  cells  or  secretion  of  a  novel  splice  isoform.  Interestingly,  the 
commercially  available  rabbit  polyclonal  antibodies  (from  two  different  sources  and  with  different 
target epitope) raised against cell attached RARRES1 failed to detect the secreted form of RARRES1 
(data  not  shown).  This  result  suggests  a  potential  posttranslational  modification  of  the  secreted 
RARRES1.

2.4.1. Quantitative RTPCR  

Quantitative  RTPCR  targeting  RARRES1  mRNA  in  total  cell  lysates  showed  a  150  fold  higher 
level of RARRES1 expression in NF1 Schwann cells relative to normal Schwann cells (Figure 3). This 
data shows that the RARRES1 gene was actively expressed in plexiform neurofibroma Schwann cells 
compared to normal Schwann cells and correlates with the high levels of secreted RARRES1 protein 
seen in NF1 Schwann cells relative to normal Schwann cells.

levels  in  normal  Schwann  cells  (NSC)  and  Schwann  cells  isolated  from  a  plexiform

GAPDH mRNA levels.

2.4.2. Western Blot Analysis  

To  verify  if  this  high  expression  of  RARRES1  mRNA  in  NF1  Schwann  cells  relative  to  normal 
Schwann  cells  translates  into  increased  expression  of  the  RARRES1  protein  in  the  cell  pellets  we 
performed Western blot analysis on the total protein extracts from NF1 and normal Schwann cells using 
two  different  rabbit  polyclonal  antibodies  against  human  RARRES1  protein.  Unlike  the  secreted 
RARRES1, the cell attached form of the RARRES1 was detected as a single band around 40 kDa in 
agreement with the antibody manufacturer datasheet and with earlier studies [16]. However, there was 
no significant difference in the expression levels of the 40 kDa RARRES1 between the normal and 
NF1 Schwann cells (Figure 4).

2.5. All-Trans Retinoic Acid Induces Expression of Secreted RARRES1 

Since the commercially available RARRES1 antibodies failed to detect extracellular RARRES1 we 
synthesized  a  stable  isotope  labeled  RARRES1  standard  by  culturing  sNF96.2  cell  line  in  medium 
where Arg and Lys were replaced by stable isotope labeled 13C6-Arg and 13C6, 15N2-Lys. All secreted 
proteins  including  RARRES1  protein  were  uniformly  and  fully  labeled  with  13C6-Arg  and  13C6,  
15N2-Lys  after  7  cell  doublings.  A  fixed  amount  of  the  stable  isotope  labeled  RARRES1  was  then 
spiked into equal aliquots of conditioned media collected from unlabeled sNF96.2 cells treated for 24 
hours with 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 1 µM RA of all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Spiked samples were processed for 
mass spectrometry analysis as described in the method. Peptides generated from de novo synthesized 
RARRES1  protein  and  the  labeled  spiked-in  RARRES1  proteins  are  detected  as  pairs  of  light  and 
heavy ions. Figure 5a shows example spectra of heavy and light ion pairs corresponding to labeled and 
unlabeled  RARRES1  tryptic  peptide  (YNPESLLQEGEGR)  generated  from  labeled  standard 
RARRES1 and de novo synthesized RARRES1. Figure 5b shows the overall expression levels of the 
cellular secreted RARRES1 by sNF96.2 treated with different doses of RA (the levels are relative to 
the spiked-in SILAC labeled standard RARRES1). While the expression levels of secreted RARRES1 
increased in a dose dependent manner in response to RA treatment with almost a 2-fold increase after 
24  hours  incubation  with  1  µM  RA  dose,  the  band  detected  by  Western  blot  analysis  for  the  cell 
attached  RARRES1  remained  unchanged  following  treatment  of  sNF96.2  cells  with  RA  even  at  a 
higher dose of 1 µM of RA (Figure 5c).

Secretome profiling of human primary Schwann cell cultures revealed several key proteins that were 
differentially secreted between the plexiform neurofibroma derived Schwann cells and the non-neoplastic 
peripheral nerve derived Schwann cells. Most of these proteins are known to play a direct role in cell 
adhesion,  cell  proliferation  and  tumorigenesis.  These  include  the  target  of  Nesh-SH3  protein  also

known as TARSH. This protein was approximately 19-fold higher in the CM of NF1 Schwann cells 
relative  to  normal  Schwann  cells.  TARSH  was  recently  described  to  play  a  role  in  cell  senescence  
via the p53 pathway [17] but also play a major role in reducing cell dendritic complexity of neural 
cells [18]. This later function might be relevant to the differentiation of neural and Schwann cells in 
the context of neurofibroma progression. Further studies to define the role of TARSH in growth and 
differentiation of Schwann cells are needed.

APOD  was  exclusively  secreted  by  all  four  NF1  Schwann  cells  cultures  and  not  by  normal 
Schwann  cells.  This  is  in  agreement  with  earlier  studies  showing  that  APOD  mRNA  levels  were 
increased in neurofibroma compared to non-neoplastic peripheral nerve [19]. Interestingly, the same 
group showed that APOD mRNA levels decreases during transformation of benign neurofibroma to 
MPNSTs.  The  exact  role  of  APOD  in  neurofibroma  progression  is  however  not  well  understood  at 
present. Nevertheless expression of APOD was often found to be increased in soft tissue tumors and 
could as well have a direct role in growth of benign tumors [20]. 

Alpha-fetoprotein  (AFP)  is  another  interesting  protein  that  was  significantly  elevated  in  the 
conditioned  media  of  the  four  NF1  Schwann  cell  cultures  compared  to  the  normal  Schwann  cell 
cultures. AFP is a 70 kDa glycoprotein that is normally expressed during fetal development then repressed 
after  birth  [21].  Its  reappearance  often  indicates  the  presence  of  a  tumor  especially  hepatocellular 
carcinoma [22] but also other tumors of germ cell origin and gastrointestinal tract [23,24]. Furthermore, 
AFP was reported to promote proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells via activation of the Ras pathway [25]. 
These data suggests that AFP might be involved in the growth and proliferation of NF1 Schwann cells 
by  acting  in  synergy  with  the  inactive  neurofibormin-1  thus  resulting  in  hyperactivation  of  the  Ras 
pathway. However, this hypothesis need to be further verified using mouse knockdown assays.  

The dramatic decrease of PAI-1 in the extracellular milieu of NF1 Schwann cells relative to normal 
Schwann cells is also highly significant in the context of neurofibroma growth and progression. Indeed, 
PAI-1  acts  as  a  physiological  inhibitor  of  urokinase-type  plasminogen  activator  (uPA),  a  serine 
protease  that  promotes  tumor  progression  and  invasiveness  [26].  An  earlier  study  targeting  the 
plasminogen activation pathway in cutaneous neurofibroma demonstrated that Schwann cells, and not 
other cells, in the neurofibroma tissue are responsible for the release of uPA and its regulator PAI-1 [27]. 
In this study we were not able to detect uPA in the secretome profiles of normal and NF1 Schwann 
cells but we detected a significant amount of uPA (7 spectral counts) in the conditioned medium of the 
malignant  sNF96.2  Schwann  cell  line  (see  supplemental  Table).  This  is  in  agreement  with  the 
malignancy of the sNF96.2 relative to the NF1 and normal Schwann cells studied herein.  

Other  interesting  proteins  that  were  abundant  in  the  extracellular  milieu  of  NF1  Schwann  cells 
relative  to  normal  Schwann  cells  include  the  perlecan  also  known  as  basement  membrane-specific 
heparan  sulfate  proteoglycan  core  protein,  a  secreted  heparan  sulfate  glycoprotein  involved  in 
endothelial cell proliferation, mitogenesis and angiogenesis [28]. The high secretion of this protein by 
NF1  Schwann  cell  might  contribute  the  complex  growth  and  vasculature  often  seen  in  plexiform 
neurfibroma tissue. Furthermore NF1 Schwann cells secreted higher amounts of EFEMP1, an activator 
of the EGFR signaling [29] while decreasing the levels of the receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase 
kappa, a negative regulator of EGFR signaling [30,31]. This suggests that EFGR signaling might be 
hyperactivated  in  NF1  Schwann  cells  relative  to  normal  Schwann  cells.  However,  this  hypothesis 
needs to be verified in future studies.

Perhaps  one  of  the  most  interesting  findings  in  the  secretome  survey  of  Schwann  cells  is  the 
exclusive secretion of a high molecular mass RARRES1 protein (~110 kDa) by the four NF1 Schwann 
cultures  including  the  sNF96.2  cell  line  and  not  by  the  normal  Schwann  cell  cultures.  Secretion  of 
RARRES1 protein is novel and to the best of our knowledge never been reported or discussed before. 
Whether  the  protein  was  proteolytically  cleaved  from  the  cell  surface  or  was  secreted  as  a  splice 
isoform remains to be carefully examined. Nevertheless, all the RARRES1 tryptic peptides identified 
by mass spectrometry in the CM of NF1 Schwann cells belonged to the extracellular domain of the 
protein. No peptides of the N-terminal domain or the transmembrane domain were detected suggesting 
potential secretion or shedding of the RARRES1 protein.  

The RARRES1 gene was first characterized by Nagpal et al. [15] as a target gene that was induced 
in human cultured skin tissue by a synthetic retinoid Tazarotene, hence the name Tazarotene-induced 
gene  1  (TIG-1).  The  gene  was  suggested  to  express  a  294  amino  acid  transmembrane  protein  with 
molecular mass of 33,285 Da. From the sequence it was predicted that RARRES1 is a single pass type 
II  membrane  protein  with  a  short  cytosolic  N-terminal  domain,  a  transmembrane  domain  and  large 
extracellular C-terminal domain. In this study we found RARRES1 protein to be actually secreted or 
released  in  the  extracellular  milieu  by  NF1  Schwann  cells.  Interestingly,  while  RARRES1  protein 
extracted  from  the  cell  pellet  was  detected  as  a  single  band  around  40  kDa  by  Western  blot,  the 
RARRES1 protein released into the CM by NF1 Schwann cells was detected in multiple bands ranging 
from 80 to 160 kDa with a highest concentration around 110 kDa. The antibody used to detect cell 
attached RARRES1 protein failed to detect the secreted RARRES1 even though several peptides were 
detected by mass spectrometry for this protein in the CM of cultured NF1 Schwan cells. This suggests 
that the released RARRES1 protein might be post-translationally modified hindering its detection by 
the  antibody  that  detects  the  40  kDa  cell  attached  RARRES1.  Based  on  the  Uniprot  knowledge 
database, human RARRES1 protein has only one potential N-glycosylation site which is not enough to 
explain  or  support  the  high  increase  in  the  molecular  mass  (up  to  160  kDa)  seen  for  extracellular 
RARRES1. Even though RARRES1 protein was previously detected in the conditioned media of some 
cancer cell lines [32,33] no details were provided regarding its molecular mass and its occurrence in 
the extracellular milieu. In this study we consistently detect secreted RARRES1 in bands ranging from 
80  to  160  kDa  with  the  highest  abundance  around  110  kDa.  All  SDS-PAGE  separations  were 
performed  under  denaturing  conditions  thus  ruling  out  the  possibility  of  oligomerization.  This 
significant increase in the molecular mass is typical for heparan sulfate modifications. However, future 
structural studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.  

Secretion of the high molecular mass RARRES1 protein was maintained in the sNF96.2 Schwann 
cell line previously established from an MPNST neurofibroma that was surgically resected from a 27 
year  old  donor  five  years  ago  [14].  We  and  others  have  examined  secretomes  of  several  human 
primary  and  tumor  cell  lines  including  retinal  pigment  epithelial  cells  [34,35],  primary  astrocytes, 
glioblastoma cell lines [36], twelve different types of human tumors cell lines [32], twenty three human 
carcinoma cells lines [33] and primary myotubes [37]. Of these cells only the Hela cell line, the colon 
cancer  cell  lines  SW620  and  Colo20  [33]  and  the  lung  carcinoma  cell  line  A549  [32]  secreted 
RARRES1 protein in their conditioned media. These data suggest that secretion of RARRES1 does 
occur  and  might  be  specific  to  certain  cancer  cell  lines  including  our  NF1  derived  Schwann  cells. 
Furthermore,  close  examination  of  the  protein  list  identified  in  a  secretome  study  of  the  omental 
 

9392 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 
adipose  tissue  explant,  also  revealed  the  presence  of  RARRES1  protein  in  the  conditioned  medium 
[38].  In  another  independent  study  high  expression  levels  of  RARRES1  gene,  up  to  59-fold  was 
observed in slowly proliferating mesenchymal stem cells derived from visceral adipose tissue versus 
highly proliferative mesenchymal stem cells derived from subcutaneous adipose [39]. It was suggested 
that RARRES1 might be involved in regulating proliferation as well as differentiation of adipose tissue 
derived  mesenchymal  stem  cells.  However,  the  authors  did  not  distinguish  between  secreted 
RARRES1 or cell attached RARRES1 since measurements were performed at the mRNA levels. In 
summary, these data on the secretome studies of cancer cell lines, the adipose tissue explant and our 
current Schwann cell secretome strongly support the existence of a secreted form of the RARRES1 
protein. This secreted RARRES1 might play role in cell differentiation and growth.  

While  this  secreted  RARRES1  protein  seems  to  be  increased  in  certain  cancer  cell  lines,  the 
attached RARRES1 protein was often reported to be less expressed, at least at the mRNA level, in 
prostate carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a leukemia cell line [40–42]. Others have shown 
that RARRES1 protein expression changes in function of cancer stage, with high expression at early 
stage  then  down-regulated  at  advanced  stage  [43].  The  down-expression  was  often  attributed  to 
hypermethylation of the promoter region of the RARRES1 gene. In our study, even though the secreted 
RARRES1 was highly expressed in the NF1 Schwann cells relative to normal Schwann cells there was 
no significant difference in the expression levels of the 40 kDa cell attached RARRES1 between these 
cells. Additionally, treatment of sNF96.2 cells with increasing doses of all-trans retinoic resulted in 
increased secretion of the RARRES1 protein but not the 40 kDa cell attached RARRES1 protein. This 
suggests  that  these  two  forms  of  the  RARRES1  protein  might  be  posttranslationally  regulated  or 
originates  from  mRNA  splicing  that  is  tightly  controlled  in  these  Schwann  cells.  However  this 
hypothesis remains to be carefully examined. 

The  lower  expression  of  cell  attached  RARRES1  in  prostate  and  nasopharyngeal  carcinoma  has 
suggested that RARRES1 protein might act as a tumor suppressor. However, mechanisms by which 
RARRES1 inhibits cell proliferation in cancer are largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that 
RARRES1  is  a  potential  inhibitor  of  the  cytoplasmic  carboxypeptidase  AGBL2,  a  protein  that  is 
involved in the regulation of tubulin tyrosination and tumorigenesis [44]. Furthermore the same group 
showed that knockdown of RARRES1 in human prostatic epithelial cell line resulted in down-regulation 
of an enzyme involved in negative regulation of the growth hormone-stimulated signal transduction 
pathways with concomitant up-regulation of a tumor suppressor disks large 2 [16]. While this might be 
true for the cell attached RARRES1 the over expression of secreted RARRES1 in NF1 Schwann cells 
and other cancer cell lines remains intriguing and requires further investigation to define the role of 
secreted RARRES1 protein in the context of tumor cells. 

3. Experimental Section  

3.1. Specimen Collection 

Normal  human  primary  Schwann  cells  were  purchased  from  ScienCell  Research  Laboratories 
(Carlsbad, CA). The normal Schwann cells were isolated from spinal nerve of healthy donor according 
to the manufacturer and were cultured into two separate batches named as NSC1 and NSC2 herein. 

 

9393 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 
The malignant sNF96.2 Schwann cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Immortalized normal human Schwann cells were a gift from Vedant 
Arun and Dr. Guha of the University of Toronto Canada. All neurofibroma specimens and nerve tissue 
specimens  were  collected  in  house  in  accordance  with  an  Institutional  Review  Board  approved 
protocol at Children’s National Medical Center (CNMC) and after obtaining patients’ written informed 
consent. Only excess specimens after diagnosis were used in this study. Diagnosis was performed at 
the pathology clinic at CNMC by Dr. Ashley Hill and reported to us as de-identified information where 
only age, gender, diagnosis and tumor location were included (Table 1). Normal sural nerve tissue was 
gift  from  Dr.  Ashley  Hill  and  was  collected  postmortem  from  a  9  week  old  female  donor.  Normal 
sciatic  nerve  was  obtained  from  the  NICHD  Brain  and  Tissue  Bank  of  the  University  of  Maryland 
Medical School. Aliquots from freshly resected tumor specimens were immediately placed in a sterile 
solution  of  serum  free  DMEM  medium  for  subsequent  Schwann  cells  isolation  and  cultivation  as 
described below.  

3.2. Isolation and Culture of Human Primary Schwann Cells  

Collected fresh tissue from each patient was dissected into 2 × 2 mm2 pieces and placed in a Petri 
Dish  containing  10  mL  of  DMEM  media  supplemented  with  0.8  U/mL  of  dispase  (Sigma-Aldrich,  
St. Louis, MO, USA) and 160 U/mL of collagenase-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) followed 
by incubation at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Media was collected and dissociated cells were pelleted by gentle 
centrifugation at 300× g for 10 min. Pelleted cells were re-suspended and cultured in basal Schwann 
Cell Medium (SCM) from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 
10%  FBS,  100  U/mL  penicillin,  100  µg/mL  streptomycin  and  1%  Schwann  cell  growth  supplement 
(SCGS) containing BSA 10 µg, insulin 5 µg, PDGF 5 ng, FGF-2 5 ng, progesterone 20 nM, forskolin 
200 nM, T3 60 nM and PMA 20 nM. Growing cells were maintained and passaged using the same 
proprietary  media.  In  parallel,  primary  human  Schwann  cells  obtained  from  ScienCell  Research 
Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as well as sNF96.2 cell line were cultured using the same media 
and  conditions.  Growing  Schwann  cells  were  characterized  by  immunofluorescent  staining  using 
rabbit antibodies against human S-100β and p75 proteins. 

3.3. Secretome Profiling  

Both normal and plexiform neurofibroma derived Schwann cells as well as sNF96.2 cell line were 
grown to 80% confluences in the SCM media above then washed 6 times with sterile PBS (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) before incubation in serum free media for an additional 24 hours. Conditioned 
media  (CM)  were  then  collected,  centrifuged  at  300×  g  and  the  supernatant  were  further  filtered 
through a 0.22 µm nylon filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to remove any cell debris or floating 
cells. Aliquots (2 mL) from each collected CM were further concentrated by using a 3 kDa cutoff filter 
(Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and processed for SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis. 
After the gel was stained (Bio-Safe Coomassie; Bio-Rad), each lane was sliced into 30 bands, and each 
band  was  in-gel  digested  with  trypsin  (Promega,  Madison,  WI,  USA)  and  the  resulting  peptides 
analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described below.

3.4. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry  

9394 

Concentrated peptides from each band were injected via an autosampler (6 μL) and loaded onto a 
Symmetry C18 trap column (5 μm, 300 μm i.d. × 23 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) for 10 min at a 
flow  rate  of  10  μL/min,  100%  A.  The  sample  was  subsequently  separated  by  a  C18  reverse-phase 
column (3.5 μm, 75 μm × 15 cm, LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min 
using an Eksigent nano-HPLC system (Dublin, CA, USA). The mobile phases consisted of water with 
0.1% formic acid (A) and 90% acetonitrile (B). A 65 minute linear gradient from 5 to 60% B was 
employed. Eluted peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a 10 μm silica tip (New 
Objective Inc., Ringoes, NJ, USA) adapted to a nano-electrospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
The  spray  voltage  was  set  at  1.2  kV  and  the  heated  capillary  at  200  °C.  The  LTQ-Orbitrap-XL 
(ThermoFisher Scientific) was operated in data-dependent mode with dynamic exclusion in which one 
cycle of experiments consisted of a full-MS in the Orbitrap (300–2000 m/z, resolution 30,000) survey 
scan and five subsequent MS/MS scans in the LTQ of the most intense peaks using collision-induced 
dissociation with the collision gas (helium) and normalized collision energy value set at 35%. 

3.5. Database Search and Quantification  

For protein identification we used the SEQUEST search engine [45] and for label free proteome 
profiling  we  used  ProteoIQ  software  (Nusep,  Bogart,  GA,  USA).  Database  search  was  performed 
against human SwissProt database (Version 198; EuropeanBioinformatics Institute: Cambridge, UK, 
2012) indexed with assumptions for fully enzymatic tryptic cleavage with two missed cleavages and 
possible 16 Da shift for oxidized Met. The search result was filtered using the following acceptance 
criteria: DeltaCn (ΔCn) > 0.08, a variable threshold of Xcorr vs charge state (Xcorr ≥ 1.9 for z = 1, 
Xcorr ≥ 2.5 for z = 2, and Xcorr ≥ 3.5 for z = 3) and with mass accuracy better than 10 ppm. SRFs 
search result files were uploaded into the ProteoIQ software for parsing and spectral counting. Median 
relative  intensity  was  compared  between  cases  and  controls  using  a  non-parametric  Wilcoxon  rank 
sum  test.  Significance  was  set  at  the  p  value  ≤  0.05  level  and  no  adjustments  for  multiple  testing  
were performed. 

3.6. Reverse-Transcription PCR 

Total  RNA  was  extracted  following  standard  protocol  of  TRIzol®  RNA  Reagents  (Invitrogen). 
Genomic  DNA  contaminant  was  removed  using  DNA-free™  Kit  (Ambion)  containing  RNase-free 
DNase I. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 µg cleaned RNA with an olig-dT primer in 
a 20 µL Super Script III First-Stand Synthesis SuperMix reaction(Invitrogen) before further PCR or 
quantitative real-time PCR analyses. For the regular PCR, 3 µL supernatant was used as input DNA to 
process PCR reaction using GoTaq® Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega). The denatured primers 
were  designed  to  amplify  human  RARRES1  and  the  sequences  are:  forward:  5-GAGCAGAG 
TTCAGTGTGCATG-3  and  reverse:  5-CAACAAGAGGATTACCTGCTTTACAAG-3.  Actin  was 
used  as  an  internal  normalization  reference  and  the  sequences  are,  forward,  5-GAAGAGCTA 
TGAGCTGCCTGAC-3 and reverse, 5-AGGTCTTTACGGATGTCAACGT-3. 10 µL of PCR reaction 
were illuminated in 2% Ethidium bromide containing agarose gel.  

 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 

9395 

Quantitative real time PCR 1 µL cDNA was used for real-time PCR in a 25 µL reaction. Monoplex 
real-time  PCR  was  conducted  in  a  96-well  spectrofluorometric  thermal  cycler  (ABI  PRISM  
7900 Sequence detector system; Applied Biosystems). RARRES1 primers used for the real time PCR 
were  chosen  from  PrimerBank  as  forward:  5-AGACAACAAGAGGATTACCTGCT-3  and  reverse:  
5-GCTGACTATTTCCAAGGGGTTT-3.  Actin  was  used  as  the  internal  normalization  control. 
Fluorescence  was  monitored  during  every  PCR  cycle  at  the  annealing  or  extension  step  and  during  
the  post-PCR  temperature  ramp.  Fold  changes  were  then  measured  according  to  manufacturer 
instructions (Invitrogen). 

3.7. Western Blot Analysis  

RARRES1  expression  was  examined  in  both  Schwann  cell  pellets  and  tissue  specimens.  After 
collecting the conditioned media for secretome analysis the remaining cells were washed three times 
with PBS and collected by gently scrapping into PBS media then pelleted by centrifugation at 300× g 
for 5 min. Total proteins were extracted from cell pellets in RIPA buffer composed of 25 mM Tris-HCl 
(pH  7.6),  150  mM  NaCl,  1%  NP-40,  1%  sodium  deoxycholate,  0.1%  SDS  (Thermo  Scientific, 
Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of total proteins (30 µg) from each sample were resuspended in 
equal volume of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE 
under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, 
USA) for Western blot analysis. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% milk (Bio-Rad) and 
membrane was incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibody against human RARRES1 in 2.5% 
milk.  We  tested  RARRES1  antibodies  from  two  different  companies:  ab76530  from  Abcam 
(Cambridge,  MA,  USA)  and  AF4255  from  R&D  Systems,  Inc  (Minneapolis,  MN,  USA).  The  next 
day, the membranes were rinsed with Tris buffer containing salt and Tween and incubated with goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (1:3K, Bio-Rad) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoblots were visualized 
by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare), and Ponceau red was used to control for protein loading. 

3.8. Effect of All-Trans Retinoic Acid on the sNF96.2 Secreted RARRES1  

Since the commercially available antibodies failed to detected and quantify secreted RARRES1, we 
synthesized stable isotope labeled RARRES1, to use as a standard, by culturing sNF96.2 cell line in 
DMEM culture media where 12C6-Arg and 12C6, 14N2-Lys were replaced by 13C6-Arg and 13C6, 15N2-Lys. 
After at least 7 cell doublings (roughly four passages), cellular proteins were uniformly labeled with 
these  stable  isotope-containing  amino  acids  including  secreted  proteins.  Cells  were  then  washed  
6 times with serum free media and incubated for another 24 hours in stable isotope labeled serum free 
media supplemented with  13C6-Arg and  13C6,  15N2-Lys. Conditioned media containing stable isotope 
labeled  proteins  was  collected,  centrifuged  at  1000  ×  g  and  further  filtered  through  a  0.2  μm 
Polyethersulfone  syringe  filter  (Corning  Inc.)  then  concentrated  using  3  kDa  MWCO  centrifugal 
filtration  device  (Millipore  Corporation,  Billerica,  MA,  USA).  The  concentrated  conditioned  media 
was assayed for total protein content using Bio-Rad protein assay kit and stored at −20 °C until use. In 
parallel, the same cell line sNF96.2 was cultured  in regular DMEM media supplemented with 10% 
FBS (ATCC), 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA),  and  1  mM  of  sodium  pyruvate  (Sigma  Aldrich,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  When  cells  reached  

 

9396 

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 
 
80–90% confluence they were washed 6 times with serum free medium then incubated for another 24 
hours in serum free medium supplemented with various doses of all-trans retinoic acid (0, 0.25, 0.5 
and  1  µM).  All-trans  retinoic  acid  solution  was  freshly  prepared  in  ethanol  just  before  use.  The 
untreated control cells were incubated with ethanol alone in serum free media for the same period of 
24  hours.  Conditioned  media  from  untreated  and  treated  cells  were  collected,  spiked  with  equal 
amounts  of  condition  media  containing  stable  isotope  labeled  RARRES1  protein  and  processed  as 
described above for SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis. Bands corresponding to RARRES1 protein 
were  sliced,  in-gel  digested  by  trypsin  and  the  resulting  peptides  were  analyzed  by  LC-MS/MS  as 
described  above.  RARRES1  tryptic  peptides  were  detected  as  pairs  of  stable  isotope  labeled  and 
unlabeled  peptides  generated  from  the  reference  stable  isotope  labeled  RARRES1  protein  and  the 
unlabeled  RARRES1  protein  secreted  by  the  RA  treated  or  untreated  sNF96.2  cell  cultures 
respectively.  For  quantification  of  RARRES1  protein  in  treated  and  untreated  cells  we  used  IP2 
software,  an  integrated  proteomic  applications  (http://integratedproteomics.com/)  that  uses  the 
extracted ion chromatogram of labeled and unlabeled peptide pairs to determine the intensity ratios of 
light to heavy peptide and thus the relative quantities of secreted RARRES1 protein by RA treated and 
untreated sNF96.2 cells versus the spiked reference stable isotope labeled RARRES1 protein.  

4. Conclusions  

The secretome survey of cultured primary Schwann cells revealed differential secretion of several 
key  proteins  between  NF1  derived  Schwann  cells  and  normal  nerve  derived  Schwann  cells.  The 
majority  of  the  differentially  secreted  proteins  are  involved  in  cell  proliferation,  adhesion  and 
migration. Secretion of the tumor suppressor RARRES1 protein by NF1 is novel and merits further 
studies to characterize the structure and the function of this secreted RARRES1 protein. 

Defining the role of these differentially secreted proteins in the context of Schwann cell biology 
might bring insight into Schwann cell transformation and neurofibroma pathogenesis. This will help 
define novel therapeutic strategies to slowdown or stop plexiform neurofibroma progression in patients 
diagnosed with NF1.
