Advances in the treatment of 
neurofibromatosis-associated tumours

Andrew L. Lin and David H. Gutmann

Abstract | Neurofibromatosis (NF) comprises two distinct genetic disorders—neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 
(NF1 and NF2)—in which affected individuals develop both benign and malignant tumours. NF1 results from 
germline mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin, while NF2 results from germline mutations 
in the NF2 gene that encodes merlin (or schwannomin). The major tumour types arising in individuals with NF1 
include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, and gliomas, whereas NF2 is characterized 
by the formation of schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. With the identification of the NF1 and NF2 
genes and the generation of robust preclinical mouse models of NF‑associated neoplasms, novel treatments 
that specifically target the growth control pathways deregulated in these tumours have been discovered, some 
of which are now being tested in clinical trials in individuals with NF1 and NF2. In this Review, we will highlight 
the key clinical features of NF1 and NF2 and the advances in future clinical management based on an improved 
understanding of the function of the NF1 and NF2 genes and the development of small‑animal models.

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) rep-
resent distinct tumour predisposition syndromes that 
largely affect the nervous system. The major tumour 
types arising in individuals with NF1 are neuro fibromas, 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, and gliomas, 
whereas individuals with NF2 are prone to the formation 
of schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependy momas.1  
While these disorders share some similarities, they are 
distinct conditions with unique genetic aetiologies and 
pathogenetic mechanisms.2 The diagnosis of NF1 
and NF2 is established using diagnostic criteria that was 
originally formulated by the National Institutes of Health 
Consensus Development panel in 1987,3 and was critically 
re-evaluated for NF2 in 2002.4 

NF1 is the more common of the two disorders, with a 
prevalence of approximately 1 in 2,500 to 3,000 world-
wide.5,6 By contrast, NF2 has a much lower birth incidence, 
with estimates ranging from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 40,000.7,8 
Over half of individuals diagnosed with NF1 and NF2 carry 
de novo mutations and represent the first person in their 
family with the condition.8,9 As NF1 and NF2 are auto somal 
dominant syndromes with complete penetrance, once an 
individual has received a diagnosis, that given individual 
typically harbours a 50:50 chance of transmitting the dis-
order to their offspring.3 However, individuals with NF2 
can also be mosaic for a mutation in the NF2 gene, resulting 
in less than a 50% risk of transmission to their offspring.10
In a systematic review of death certificates, the mean age 
of death for individuals with NF1 was 54.4 years (versus 
70.1 years in the general population) with death from

malignancy disproportionately high among indivi duals 
that died before the age of 30.11 Similarly, indivi duals with 
NF2 have a reduced life expectancy from disease-related 
causes. In a recent observational study, the estimated life 
expectancy for individuals with NF2 was 69.0 years com-
pared to a life expectancy of 71.5 years for individuals with 
NF1 and 80.0 years for the general population.12

Prior to the 1990s, the treatment of NF-associated 
tumours was largely managed by surgeons and oncologists 
in an identical fashion to histologically-similar tumours 
arising in the general population. With the cloning of the 
NF1 and NF2 genes, the generation of preclinical mouse 
models for many of the NF-associated tumour types, 
and the establishment of a clinical trials consortium, 
there have been enormous advances in the therapeutic 
options available for affected individuals. In this Review, 
we discuss the clinical features, genetic aeti ologies, and 
pathogenesis of neoplasia in NF1 and NF2. We also 
describe the current treatment options for patients with 
NF1 and NF2, and  advances in clinical and preclinical 
science that will impact on the future treatment of these 
two hereditary tumour predisposition syndromes.

Clinical features of NF1
Individuals with NF1 have a predisposition to the 
develop ment of Schwann cell neoplasms (neurofibromas, 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours), gliomas 
(optic pathway gliomas, malignant gliomas), leukaemia, 
pheochromocytoma, and several other tumours (such as 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma, 
and breast cancer; Box 1 and Figure 1).13–26

associated with NF1, are benign peripheral nerve sheath

tumours (PNSTs) that arise from Schwann cell pro genitors, 
embedded in a microenvironment composed of peri-
neural cells, fibroblasts, mast cells and a rich col lagenous 
extra cellular matrix (Figure 1a).27 These benign PNSTs 
can occur on nerves anywhere in the peripheral nervous 
system. Cutaneous neurofibromas are the most common 
type of neurofibroma and can appear as nodular masses, 
peduncular lesions, or diffuse plaques. These tumours 
frequently begin to develop during early adolescence and 
continue to increase in number throughout adulthood.27 
Importantly, cuta neous neurofibromas do not transform 
into malignant PNSTs (MPNSTs).27,28 Internal PNSTs are 
also very common and are present in as many as 60% of 
indivi duals with NF1,15 where they can present as intra-
neural or plexiform neuro fibromas. Intraneural neurofibro-
mas are fusiform expansions of a peripheral nerve, typically 
involving the spinal roots, which frequently develop a 
dumbbell appearance as they enlarge.29 By contrast, plexi-
form neurofibromas involve multiple fascicles of a nerve 
or a plexus and can extend down its branches (Figure 1b). 
Hence, plexiform neurofibromas may feel like a ‘bag of 
worms’ on palpation. These tumours are usually detected 
in young children and grow most rapidly during the first 
decade of life.30 These more diffuse PNSTs can exert a mass 
effect, compressing nearby structures (such as the trachea 
or blood vessels), and either stimulate bone growth or lead 
to bone erosion. PNSTs can also cause spinal cord com-
pression, weakness, cranial neuropathy, disfigurement, 
and pain.30 Moreover, these tumours have a rich vascular 
network and can bleed profusely, especially during surgery.
Unlike cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neuro-
fibromas can undergo malignant transformation into 
MPNSTs—an aggressive spindle-cell sarcoma. The 
lifetime risk for individuals with NF1 of developing a 

MPNST is between 8% and 13%, with a peak incidence 
in their mid-30s.16 MPNSTs are difficult to treat and can 
be widely metastatic to the lungs, soft tissue, and bone.31 
Unfortunately, current therapies have shown little long-
term benefit, and most individuals succumb to these 
cancers within 5 years following diagnosis.

Individuals with NF1 are also prone to the develop-
ment of gliomas, most commonly pilocytic astrocyto-
mas (WHO grade I) involving the optic pathway (optic 
pathway glioma [OPG]; Figure 1c).32 These tumours are 
predominantly observed in children younger than 7 years 
of age, with a mean age at presentation of 4.2 years.17 
They can affect one or both optic nerves, the chiasm, or 
the postchiasmal optic tracks.17,33,34 Bilateral optic nerve 
involvement is common in children with NF1-OPG. 
Although the incidence of OPG in patients with NF1 is 
15–20%, fewer than half of these tumours cause symp-
toms.17,18,35 When symptomatic, children typically present 
with decreased vision or precocious puberty secondary to 
tumour infiltration of the hypothalamus.36

In addition to OPGs, gliomas can develop in the brain-
stem. Brainstem gliomas occur with an estimated lifetime 
incidence of 4% or higher, and typically become sympto-
matic in children younger than 10 years of age.37,38 Many 
of these tumours occur in the medulla with occasional 
extension into the pons. They can result in brainstem 
dysfunction, including dysarthria, cranial neuropathies 
and incoordination, and can compromise the ventricu-
lar system, resulting in hydrocephalus and headache.37–39 
Most often, these tumours are pilocytic astrocytomas 
or, less commonly, grade II astrocytomas. In rare cir-
cumstances, cerebellar gliomas are observed, but when 
detected, these are typically pilocytic astro cytomas, which 
are usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.40

Although the majority of brain tumours in this patient 
population are low-grade gliomas (astrocytomas) that 
occur during the first decade of life, adults with NF1 are 
at higher risk of developing high-grade tumours (WHO 
grade III and IV). Compared to the general population, 
adults with NF1 are 50 to 100 times more likely to develop 
a symptomatic non-optic pathway brain tumour.19 The 
majority of these tumours arise in the cerebral hemi-
spheres (more frequently within cortical than subcortical 
areas), and only a minority are pilocytic astrocytomas. In 
this regard, 40% of non-optic pathway tumours reported 
in one cohort were grade II, 27% were grade III, and 13% 
were grade IV.19 The high-grade tumours (WHO grade III 
and IV) occurred in patients older than 20 years of age.19
Other less-common cancers that occur in individuals 
with NF1 include leukaemia (juvenile chronic myelo-
genous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome), 
rhabdomyo sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, 
and pheochromocytoma.21–24 Pheochromocytomas 
deserve particular mention owing to their association 
with unexplained hypertension in this at-risk population.23 
These endocrine tumours generate excess cate cholamines, 
leading to dramatic changes in blood pressure. It has also 
been shown that women younger than 50 years of age 
with NF1 have a fivefold increased risk of breast cancer.26 
Secondary malignancies, such as MPNST or malignant

glioma, are also reported in indivi duals with NF1, typi-
cally as a result of ionizing radiation administered to treat 
another cancer earlier in life.41,42

Clinical features of NF2
Tumours arising in individuals with NF2 are distinct from 
those seen in NF1 (Box 2, Figure 2). Vestibular schwanno-
mas (VS) are a hallmark of NF2 and are present in >95% 
of individuals with this condition (Box 2; Figure 2a).43,44 
Previously called acoustic neuromas, the name of these 
neoplasms was changed to reflect their Schwann cell 
lineage origins and the primary involvement of the vestib-
ular, rather than the cochlear, branch of the eighth cranial 
nerve.45 Although the vast majority of unilateral VS occur 
sporadically, it is rare for an indivi dual without NF2 to 
develop bilateral VS.7 Histologically, NF2-associated VS 
tend to be more lobular and less vascular relative to their 
sporadic counterparts, and become symptomatic earlier in 
life.43,46 In individuals with NF2, 44% of affected persons 
who become sympto matic as adults present with symp-
toms attributable to VS, including hearing loss, tinnitus, 
and vestibulopathy.43 Over time, progressive growth of 
these cranial nerve tumours can cause brainstem compres-
sion. When indivi duals with NF2 present as children, they 
are less likely to become symptomatic from an underlying 
VS; rather, they are more likely to become symptomatic as 
a result of mass effect from an intracranial or spinal cord 
lesion, a peripheral nerve tumour, or a cutaneous lesion.47
Over their lifetime, 24 to 51% of individuals with NF2 
will develop a schwannoma of another cranial nerve in 
addition to VS, most commonly along the fifth, seventh, 
ninth, or twelfth cranial nerves.48,49 Schwannomas also 
develop near the spinal cord and along peripheral nerves, 
resulting in peripheral neuropathies, appearing as cuta-
neous tumours in 59–68% of individuals with NF2.43,48 
Schwannomatosis50 is a syndrome that shares some clinical 
features with NF2, but is not caused by germline mutations 
in the NF2 gene. Instead, these tumors arise in individu-
als with mutations in the SMARCB1 tumour suppressor 
gene.51 Individuals with this condition can also develop 
multiple schwannomas, but in contrast to indivi duals with 
NF2, they rarely develop VS.52

Meningiomas occur in 45–58% of persons with NF2 
(Box 2, Figure 2b).43,48 NF2-associated meningiomas 
tend to occur at an earlier age than sporadic meningio-
mas (during the third and fourth decade of life versus 
the middle of the sixth decade), and individuals with 
NF2 are prone to the development of multiple meningio-
mas.43,53 Meningiomas can affect the spinal cord and are 
difficult to distinguish from other spinal tumours arising 
in individu als with NF2. They may develop along the 
optic nerve, which can appear on neuroimaging studies 
as optic gliomas arising in the context of NF1.54

Finally, ependymomas are also observed in persons with 
NF2. These are intramedullary glial cell neoplasms most 
often involving the cervical cord (Box 2, Figure 2c).55,56 
The frequency of these tumours in the NF2 population 
is unclear; however, estimates range from 33% to 53% of 
affected individuals.56 Fortunately, only a minority of these 
tumours cause symptoms and require treatment.

Genetics of NF1 and NF2
The genes mutated in NF1 and NF2 are tumour suppressor 
genes, which encode for proteins involved in divergent sig-
nalling pathways (Figure 3). While individu als with NF1 
and NF2 start life with one functional copy of NF1 and 
NF2 genes in every cell of their bodies (with the excep-
tion of those with mosaic forms of NF1 or NF2), NF1-
associated and NF2-associated tumours exhibit total loss of 
the protein products encoded by the respective genes.57–59

The NF1 gene resides on chromosome 17 and codes 
for neurofibromin. Neurofibromin is a 220 kDa cyto-
plasmic protein containing a region of 300 amino acids 
with signifi cant homology to domains found in GTPase-
activating proteins (GAPs).60–62 GAPs comprise a family 
of proteins that function as negative regulators of the RAS 
proto-oncogene, an important regulator of cell prolifer-
ation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration.63 Ras 
cycles between one of two states—an active GTP-bound 
conformation and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. 
Interaction with neurofibromin accelerates the intrinsic 
GTPase activity of Ras, leading to Ras inactivation and 
reduced cell growth (Figure 3).62,64,65 In NF1-associated 
tumours, loss of neurofibromin results in high levels of 
activated Ras, leading to increased cell growth.62,66,67 NF1 
loss leads to hyperactivation of the downstream effec-
tor proteins that transduce Ras signalling, including the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen- 
activated kinase kinase (MEK) signalling intermediates.68,69 
In addition to its role in the negative regulation of Ras, 
neurofibromin is a positive regulator of adenylyl cyclase, 
the enzyme responsible for the generation of intra cellular 
cyclic AMP (cAMP).70,71 In some cell types, including 
neurons, reduced neuro fibromin levels leads to decreased 
i ntracellular cAMP levels and attenuated cell survival.72

The NF2 tumour suppressor gene is located on human 
chromosome 22q and encodes another cytoplasmic protein 
called merlin (or schwannomin). Merlin is a 595-amino-
acid protein with structural similarity to proteins of the 
Band 4.1 family.73,74 The shared band 4.1 domain spans 300 
amino acids at the N-terminus of merlin, where it likely 
facilitates interactions with membrane-associated molecu-
lar partners, including SCHIP1 and fodrin (β2-spectrin).75 
Merlin regulates the activation of several growth factor 
receptors (the EGFR and HER2 receptors) and suppresses 
the Rac1, mTOR, and Hippo/YAP intracellular mitogenic 
signalling pathways.76–79 Loss of merlin results in the 
increased activation of a number of these growth control 
signalling pathways (Figure 3), although there is currently 
no consensus as to which pathway is most important for 
tumorigenesis in any given tissue.

Treatment of NF‑associated neoplasms
Until recently, treatments for tumours arising in individu-
als with NF1 and NF2 were similar to those employed 
for histologically-similar tumours encountered in the 
general population. In the case of NF1, current therapies 
for cutaneous neurofibromas that cause disfigurement 
include surgery and, in some instances, CO2 laser treat-
ment or electrodessication.80 Plexiform neuro fibromas are 
largely debulked when clinically indicated, although their 
infiltrative nature presents significant challenges during 
surgery, and some patients will experi ence nerve damage 
or significant haemorrhage.30 As a result of advances in 
the understanding of NF1 at the molecular and cellular 
level, new investigational agents are now being evaluated 
in clinical trials (Table 1). One such promising thera-
peutic agent is imatinib, which was recently shown in a 
small phase II study to reduce plexiform neurofibroma 
growth by ≥20% in 17% of treated individuals.81 These 
indivi duals exhibiting therapeutic responses harboured 
plexiform neurofibromas in the neck and pelvic regions, 
and these results prompted a planned clinical trial focused 
specifically on imatinib treatment in this subgroup of 
NF1-affected individuals.

Malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibro-
mas into MPNSTs is a significant problem in indivi duals 
with NF1 and is a leading cause of death. Individuals with 
NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas must be moni-
tored for a change in tumour growth and for signs and 
symptoms of transformation, including the development 
of pain, neurological deficit (weakness), or constitutional 
symptoms (weight loss, night sweats). While MRI can 
define the anatomic location and extent of a PNST, it does 
not provide accurate information regarding malignant 
transformation.82 FDG-PET is a helpful imaging modality 
for distinguishing benign PNSTs from malignant PNSTs 
(Figure 1d).83 In several studies, m etabolically-active 
tumours with FDG standard uptake values greater than 4 
were most often MPNSTs.84,85 Likewise, chest CT scans 
are useful for detection of metastatic disease, particu-
larly when tumours spread to the lungs.86 Treatment of 
a MPNST involves surgical resection with subsequent

radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The best outcomes are 
achieved following radical excision of the tumour with 
wide surgical margins.31 When chemo therapy is employed, 
doxorubicin and ifosfamide have been shown to be effec-
tive; however, there is currently no standard care for these 
deadly cancers.87 Unfortunately, long-term survival is rare 
when MPNST occurs in patients with NF1 because of lung 
and bone metastases as well as local tumour recurrence.88
Another important consideration when managing 
patients with NF1 is the occurrence of OPG. Since the 
majority of NF1-associated OPGs are asymptomatic, sur-
veillance in children younger than 12 years of age entails 
annual examinations by an experienced ophthalmo-
logist. Age-appropriate visual screening tools should be 
employed, since vision loss typically occurs in young pre-
verbal children.89 Screening neuroimaging is not recom-
mended, as early identification of an OPG does not 
improve clinical outcome.17,35 When a patient with NF1-
associated OPG exhibits clinical progression, as evidenced 
by declining vision or precocious puberty, treatment with 
chemotherapy is usually initiated. The typical first-line 
treatment is combination therapy with carboplatin and 
vincristine, although other alkylating agents (such as vin-
blastine) are sometimes used.89 Surgery is usually reserved 
for individuals with unilateral optic gliomas causing prop-
tosis and a blind eye. Radiation therapy is not employed 
in individuals with NF1 because of the increased risk for 
radiation-induced secondary malignancies, the majority 
of which are high-grade gliomas. A retrospective study 
found a threefold increase in the relative risk of developing 
a second nervous system malignancy among 18 patients 
with optic gliomas treated with radiotherapy compared to 
40 patients who did not receive radiation.42

The treatment of NF2-associated neoplasms pre-
dominantly entails conservative monitoring and, when 
appropriate, surgical intervention.90,91 In the case of VS, 
the surgeon aims to achieve a complete resection; unfor-
tunately, this is often not possible owing to adherence 
of the tumour to the facial nerve or, rarely, to the brain-
stem, and instead, deliberate incomplete resections may 
be performed to preserve nerve function. The decision 
to operate requires the coordinated efforts of multiple 
medical services (otolaryngology, neurosurgery, medical 
oncology) to best determine when surgery is most likely 
to preserve hearing and result in minimal potential 
second ary consequences. In some centres, VS may also be 
treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Hearing preserva-
tion has been reported in 40% of patients with NF2 3 years 
after radiosurgery to treat VS.92 However, similar to con-
ventional surgery, radiosurgery can also result in facial 
and trigeminal cranial nerve dysfunction.93 Bevacizumab, 
an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has emerged as a 
first-line treatment for VS in indivi duals with NF2. In 
the largest case series to date, 57% of individu als had a 
hearing response (improvement in word recognition), 
and 55% exhibited a radiographic response (20% decrease 
in tumour volume) following bevacizumab treatment. At 
3 years, 61% had stable or improved hearing and 54% had 
stable or decreased tumour size.94 A phase II clinical trial 
(NCT01767792) is currently underway to further evaluate

Surgery is the primary treatment modality for sympto-
matic and progressively enlarging NF2-associated 
ependymomas, non-vestibular schwannomas, and 
meningiomas. Mortality following surgery for meningio-
mas has been estimated to be two-to-three times higher 
in individuals with NF2 compared to the general popula-
tion, since NF2-associated meningiomas tend to be larger 
at the time of surgery.90 Effective medical treatments for 
meningiomas are not yet available, although treatment 
with stereotactic radiosurgery and b iologically-based 
therapies are currently being explored for these tumours 
in early phase studies.

Advances in NF therapeutics
One of the most exciting advances in the field of NF 
clinical therapeutics was the development and intelli-
gent use of mouse models of NF-associated malignancy. 
Over the past decade, numerous genetically-engineered 
mouse (GEM) strains have been developed and used 
in pre clinical therapeutic studies of NF (Table 2). The 
availability of robust preclinical mouse models not only 
provides an experimental platform to discover new thera-
peutic targets for drug design, but also enables the rapid 
evaluation of new classes of compounds prior to testing 
in human clinical trials.

GEM strains for NF1-associated cutaneous neuro-
fibroma, plexiform neurofibroma, optic glioma, MPNST, 
and leukaemia have been developed.97–105 Similarly, mouse 
models of NF2-associated schwannoma and m eningioma 
have also been generated.106–109 While each of these 
models has their limitations, they have provided instruc-
tive information to guide the design and execution of 
human clinical trials.110 For example, Nf1 GEM strains  
of optic glioma and plexiform neurofibroma have 
revealed the critical role of non-neoplastic stromal cells 
(tumour microenvironment) in cancer maintenance. In 
these studies, mice lacking Nf1 expression in Schwann cell 
or astroglial cell precursors alone do not develop tumours; 
however, Nf1+/- mice (genetically similar to individuals 
with NF1) with loss of Nf1 expression in Schwann cell 
or astroglial cell precursors form neurofibromas and 
optic gliomas, respectively.99,100,111 Other studies have 
established that the mast cell is an important stromal cell 
type in mouse plexiform neurofibromas as they provide 
chemokines and growth factors critical for maintain-
ing tumour growth.112 The identification of mast cells as 
microenvironmental drivers of plexiform neurofibroma 
growth led to the evaluation of imatinib, which inhibits 
c-kit, in preclinical Nf1 mouse studies. These studies have 
now led to human clinical trials of imatinib for plexiform 
neurofibromas in adults with NF1.81

Results from other GEM studies support future clinical 
trials using sorafenib, rapamycin analogues (for example, 
everolimus), and MEK inhibitors for NF1-associated 
plexiform neurofibroma,69,113 rapamycin analogues and 
chemokine receptor inhibitors for NF1-associated glioma

and MPNST,114–117 and the tyrosine kinase i nhibitors 
n ilotinib and lapatinib for NF2-associated VS.118,119

While GEM models have great potential for clini-
cal translation, it is important to establish standards 
for the interpretation of results from mouse pre clinical 
studies. Attention should be paid to the number of mice 
exhibit ing radiographic responses, the durability of these 
responses, and the magnitude of tumour shrinkage. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in these 
mouse models should also be taken into consideration 
when designing clinical trials.

A second, but equally critical, advance in NF clinical 
therapeutics was the establishment of the Department 
of Defense-sponsored Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials 
Consortium (NFCTC).120 This consortium was devel-
oped to address the issues associated with conducting 
efficient therapeutic trials in NF where there is inher-
ent clinical variability between patients and insufficient 
numbers of affected individuals at any one single insti-
tution. The mission of the NFCTC is to create an infra-
structure to accelerate the development and completion 
of biologically- informed, statistically-sound transla-
tional clinical trials for adults and children with NF1 
and NF2. To date, this consortium has initiated several 
clinical trials, including sorafenib for NF1-associated 
plexiform neurofibromas (NCT00727233),121 bevaci-
zumab and everolimus for MPNST (NCT01661283),122 
and everolimus for progressive NF1-associated glioma

(NCT01158651).123 Future early phase studies will entail 
the critical evaluation of bevacizumab for NF2-associated 
VS and additional Ras effector targeted therapies for 
NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma.120

Conclusions
The tumours that develop in individuals with NF1 and 
NF2 predisposition syndromes are molecularly and cellu-
larly heterogeneous neoplasms, representing complex 
cancers in which distinct cell types and control pathways 
contribute to continued tumour growth (Figure 4). With 
the development of robust preclinical mouse models for 
many of the common tumour types in NF1 and NF2, 
coupled with the availability of a clinical trials infra-
structure for rapid drug evaluation in people, unique 
opportunities for translational medicine have emerged, 
which will increasingly inform the future management 
of patients with NF.
