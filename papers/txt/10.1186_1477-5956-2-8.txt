Abstract
Background: Chaperones (CH) play an important role in tumor biology but no systematic work
on expressional patterns has been reported so far. The aim of the study was therefore to present
an analytical method for the concomitant determination of several CH in human tumor cell lines,
to generate expressional patterns in the individual cell lines and to search for tumor and non-tumor
cell line specific CH expression.
Human  tumor  cell  lines  of  neuroblastoma,  colorectal  and  adenocarcinoma  of  the  ovary,
osteosarcoma,  rhabdomyosarcoma,  malignant  melanoma,  lung,  cervical  and  breast  cancer,
promyelocytic  leukaemia  were  homogenised,  proteins  were  separated  on  two-dimensional  gel
electrophoresis with in-gel digestion of proteins and MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis was carried out for
the identification of CH.
Results: A series of CH was identified including the main CH groups as HSP90/HATPas_C, HSP70,
Cpn60_TCP1, DnaJ, Thioredoxin, TPR, Pro_isomerase, HSP20, ERP29_C, KE2, Prefoldin, DUF704,
BAG, GrpE and DcpS.
Conclusions: The ten individual tumor cell lines showed different expression patterns, which are
important for the design of CH studies in tumor cell lines. The results can serve as a reference map
and form the basis of a concomitant determination of CH by a protein chemical rather than an
immunochemical method, independent of antibody availability or specificity.

Background
Chaperones  (CH)  and  heat  shock  proteins  (HSPs)  play
important  roles  in  tumor  biology  and  still  are  holding
centre stage. The heat shock response was discovered in
1962 by Ritossa [1], who reported that elevated tempera-
ture led to the appearance of a new 'puffing' pattern in the
salivary  gland  polytene  chromosomes  of  Drosophila
busckii. Since then, efforts from a large number of investi-
gators have shown that the heat shock response is ubiqui-

tous and highly conserved. It is observed in all organisms
from bacteria to plants and animals. CH form an essential
defense mechanism for protection of cells from a variety
of harmful conditions, including temperature elevation or
heat shock, decrease in pH, hypersalinity, alcohols, heavy
metals, oxidative stress, inhibitors of energy metabolism,
fever or inflammation [2,3]. This broad spectrum of func-
tions gave rise to the term 'molecular chaperone' an entity
that acts to assist other proteins' folding and maturation

in the cell. However, not all HSPs are CH and not all CH
are HSPs [4].

Genetic  studies  showed  that  most  HSPs  are  essential  to
life. They are believed to play an indispensable role in the
conformational  maturation  of  a  nascent  polypeptide
chain  in  prokaryotic  and  eukaryotic  cells.  Traditionally,
HSPs  are  grouped  into  five  major  families  according  to
molecular  weights.  They  were  designated  HSP90  (heat
shock  protein  of  apparent  molecular  weight  90  kDa),
HSP70 (70-kDa HSPs), HSP60 (60-kDa HSPs), HSP40 or
DnaJ (40-kDa HSPs), and the small heat shock proteins
(sHSPs) [5-7].

The  connection  of HSPs  with  tumor immunity  was  dis-
covered in the 1980s [8-10]. It was found that structurally
unaltered HSPs which are purified from tumor cells could
immunize animals to generate tumor-specific immunity
whereas corresponding preparations from normal tissues
did not. Many recent interesting observations have been
made with regards to CH's ability to regulate tumor biol-
ogy. HSP70 and other CH are known to be determinants
of cell death and cell transformation processes. Elevated
expression  of  HSP70  and  HSP90  in  tumor  cells  was
detected in several cases [11,12]. Recently, it has been rec-
ognised that HSPs regulate apoptosis. HSP27 and HSP70
are antiapoptotic, while HSP60 and HSP10 are proapop-
totic.  The  ability  of  HSPs  to  protect  cells  from  stressful
stimuli suggests that these proteins play a role in tumori-
genicity,  with  the  fact  that  cells  or  tissues  from  various
tumors have been shown to express unusually high levels
of one or more HSPs. Experimental models support the
role  of  HSPs  in  tumorigenesis  since  HSP27  and  HSP70
have been shown to increase the tumorigenic potential of
rodent cells in syngeneic hosts [13,14].

The contribution of HSPs to tumorigenesis may be attrib-
uted  to  their  pleiotropic  activities  as  molecular  chaper-
ones that provide the cancer cell with an opportunity to
alter  protein  activities,  in  particular  components  of  the
cell  cycle  machinery,  kinases  and  other  proteins  impli-
cated  in  tumor  progression.  HSP70  chaperone  activity
may also influence tumorigenesis by regulating the activ-
ity of proteins that are involved in the cell cycle machinery
[15].

Clinically,  in  a  number  of  cancers  such  as  leukaemia,
breast cancer and endometrial cancer, an increased level
of HSP27, relative to its level in non-transformed cells has
been  detected [16].  In  addition, increased  expression  of
HSP70  has  also  been  reported  in  high-grade  malignant
tumors such as breast and endometrial cancer, osteosar-
coma and renal cell tumors [17-19]. HSP70 levels corre-
late  with  malignancy  in  osteosarcoma  and  renal  cell
tumors;  its  expression  is  paradoxically  associated  with

improved prognosis [18,20]. HSP90 and HSP60 are also
over-expressed in breast tumors, lung cancer, leukaemias
and Hodgkin's disease [19,21-23]. The molecular basis for
over-expression  of  HSPs  in  tumors  is  not  completely
understood and may have different etiologies. For exam-
ple, overexpression may be due to the suboptimal cellular
environment in poorly vascularised hypoxic tumors or to
growth conditions within the solid tumor [24].

Many studies have focused on the critical role of chaper-
ones in protein folding, their relevance in protein confor-
mational diseases and tumorigenesis. There is, however,
no systematic information available on their expressional
pattern in individual tumor cell lines in a wide range of
tumors.

This study addresses the question of differential chaper-
one expression studied in ten different tumor and three
normal cell lines using 2-DE and matrix-assisted laser des-
orption/ionization-mass 
(MALDI-TOF/
TOF) allowing concomitant determination of many CH at
the protein chemical level rather than by immunochemi-
cal  methods,  independent  of  antibody  availability  and
specificity.

Results
Chaperone proteins were taken from the list of all identi-
fied proteins from ten tumor and three normal cell lines
using a predetermined list of expected CH based upon our
own experiments, databases and literature. Identified CH
proteins made up approx. 12% of all identified proteins in
all  cell  lines  studied.  All  major  housekeeping  proteins
(cytoskeleton and metabolic) expected to occur in any cell
lines  were  present  in  all  cell  lineages  studied  (data  not
shown).

A  series  of  chaperone  proteins with  different expression
patterns in ten different tumor and three normal cell lines
using 2-DE and MALDI-MS were identified and listed (see
Additional file 1 and 2) in Table 1 and 1-1. Chaperone
proteins were classified according to their domains. Most
proteins  have  similar  pI  values  and  molecular  weights
with theoretical value. The observed pI was represented in
Table 2 (see Additional file 3) with the total score and the
number of peptides matched. The expressional patterns of
each  tumor  and  normal  cell  line  are  shown  in  Figure
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.

Proteins with HATPase_C and HSP90 domains
Prominent members of the HSP90 family of proteins are
heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90α), heat shock pro-
tein-beta (HSP90β) and endoplasmin (GRP94) [25]. The
two  HSP90  isoforms  are  essential  for  the  viability  of
eukaryotic cells. They are rather abundant constitutively,
making up 1–2% of cytosolic proteins, and can be further

stimulated in their expression level by stress. HSP90α and
HSP90β  were  expressed  in  HCT116  and  Hela  cells.  In
addition, HSP90α was also detected in A-673, MCF-7 and
A549 cell lines and HSP90β was in Saos-2, SK-N-SH, HL-
60  and  A375  cell  lines,  respectively.  The  isoform  of
HSP90β  (Acc.No.Q9NTK6)  was  also  detected  in  A-673
cells and is represented in Figure 8.

All  cell  lines  except  adenocarcinoma  cells  (CaOv-3)
expressed endoplasmin (GRP94) protein that functions in
the endoplasmic reticulum [26] and the protein similar to
tumor rejection antigen is observed in the osteosarcoma
(Saos-2) cell line represented in Figure 1.

Heat shock protein 75 kDa is named tumor necrosis factor
type 1 receptor associated protein or TRAP1. The 2.4-kilo-
base  TRAP-1  mRNA  was  variably  expressed  in  skeletal
muscle, liver, heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, and pla-
centa. TRAP-1 mRNA was also detected in each of eight
different transformed cell lines [27]. At the protein level,
it was expressed in ovary (CaOv-3), lung (A549), skin (A-
375), rhabdomyosarcoma (A-673), breast cancer (MCF-7)
and cervix carcinoma (Hela) cells.

Proteins with HSP 70 domain
The  HSP70  family  constitutes  the  most  conserved  and
best  studied  class  of  HSPs.  Human  cells  contain  several
HSP70 family members including stress inducible HSP70,
constitutively  expressed  HSC70,  mitochondrial  HSP75,
and GRP78 localised in the endoplasmic reticulum [28].
HSP70 has been shown to increase the tumorigenicity of
cancer  cells  in  rodent  models  [13].  All  ten  tumor  cells
expressed HSC70 proteins and the isoform of HSC70 was
also observed in promyeloblasts (HL-60).

The 105-kDa protein shows high similarity with HSP90
on peptide mapping with trypsin digestion. Except for the
molecular  mass,  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the
105-kDa protein are similar to those of HSP90, although
it has a HSP70 domain. This is detected in the brain, but
not in the liver, lung, spleen, kidney, ovary, or uterus, in
contrast to the wide distribution of HSP90 [29]. In case of
tumor cells, it was observed in adenocarcinoma (CaOv-
3),  rhabdomyosarcoma  (A-673),  breast  cancer  (MCF-7)
and cervix carcinoma (Hela) cells and is shown in Figure
4,8,9 and 10.

HSP70 kDa protein 1(HSP70-1) stabilises preexistent pro-
teins against aggregation and mediate the folding of newly
translated  polypeptides  in  the  cytosol  as  well  as  within
organelles.  HSP70-1  in  mitochondria  and  endoplasmic
reticulum plays an additional role by providing a driving
force for protein translocation. They are involved in signal
transduction  pathways  in  cooperation  with  HSP90  and
participate in all these processes through their ability to

recognise  non-native  conformations  of  other  proteins.
Eight  cell  lines  except  SK-N-SH  and  CaOv-3  cells
expressed HSP70-1.

Heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 was observed in SK-N-SH,
HL-60 and A-673 cells and is represented in Figure 2,6 and
8.

Stress-70 protein (GRP75) was proposed to be implicated
in the control of cell proliferation and cellular aging [30]
and  was  observed  in  eight  cell  lines  except  MCF-7  and
Hela cells.

Heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2 and 150 kDa oxygen-
regulated  protein  were  detected  in  SK-N-SH  and  MCF-7
cells.

The best characterised GRP is a 78 kDa protein known as
GRP78,  which  is  identical  to  BiP,  the  immunoglobulin
heavy  chain  binding  protein  [31].  Since  GRP78  shares
similar  function  and  60%  amino  acid  identity  with
HSP70 [32], it is also categorised within the HSP70 multi-
gene family [33]. GRP78 / BiP protein were expressed in
all ten tumor cells.

Proteins with Cpn60_TCP1 domain
Proteins  with  a  Cpn60_TCP1  domain  are  involved  in
chaperonins,  which  belong  to  the  55–64  kDa  family  of
HSP  or  stress  proteins  [34].  Mammalian  HSP60,  also
called chaperonin, is mostly contained within the mito-
chondrial  matrix,  although  it  has  also  been  detected  in
extramitochondrial sites. HSP60 participates in the fold-
ing  of  mitochondrial  proteins  and  facilitates  proteolytic
degradation  of  misfolded  or  denatured  proteins  in  an
ATP-dependent  manner.  The  chaperone  function  of
HSP60 is regulated by HSP10, which binds to HSP60 and
regulates substrate binding and ATPase activity [7]. In this
study, all cells except MCF-7 expressed 60-kDa heat shock
protein.

The  chaperonin-containing  T-complex  polypeptide  has
many subunits. Among these, alpha, beta, gamma, epsi-
lon and zeta units as well as the isoform of epsilon subu-
nit were shown in 2-DE gels of tumor cell lines. T-complex
protein 1, zeta subunit was detected in all ten tumor cell
lines.

Proteins with DnaJ and DnaJ_C domains
Among  numerous  co-chaperones  for  HSC70  [35],  the
DnaJ  family  is  an  essential  group..  The  human  DnaJ
(HSP40) family [36] is a noncanonical member of DnaJ,
which lacks the zinc-finger domain. DnaJ homolog sub-
family A member 1 and 2 were detected in A549 and SK-
N-SH cell lines and DnaJ homolog subfamily B member

11 was found in SK-N-SH, A549 and Hela cells (Figure 2,5
and 10).

Proteins with a thioredoxin domain
Protein disulfide isomerase, protein disulfide A3 and A6
containing  2  thioredoxin  domains  are  members  of  the
protein  disulfide  isomerase  family  and  rearrange  both
intra-chain and inter-chain disulfide bonds in proteins to
form the native structures. Protein disulfide isomerase was
expressed  in  CaOv-3,  A549  and  HL-60  cells.  Protein
disulfide isomerase A3 was detected in nine cells except
Hela cell and protein disulfide isomerase A6 was observed
in HL-60, A-375, A-673 and Hela cell lines.

Proteins with a TPR domain
Stress-induced-phosphoprotein  1 
showing  9  TPR
domains was expressed in all cell lines except Saos-2 cell.
Hsc70-interacting  protein  with  3  TPR  domains  was
detected in HL60 and A-375 cell. FK506-binding protein
4  has  3  TPR  and  2FKBP_C  domains.  This  protein  was
observed  in  SK-N-SH,  A549,  HL-60,  A-375  and  MCF-7
cells.

Proteins with other domains
Heat shock 27 kDa protein (HSP27) is involved in the sta-
bilisation  of  cytoskeletal  proteins  and  in  the  protective
mechanisms  against  oxidative  stress  by  abolishing  the
burst of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) [37].
HSP27  is  the  only  protein  detected  among  small  heat-
shock  proteins  in  SK-N-SH,  HCT,  A549,  HL-60,  MCF-7
and Hela cell.

Peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans 
a
Pro_isomerase  domain  and  accelerates  folding  of  pro-
teins.  It  was  observed  in  SK-N-SH,  A549,  HL-60,  A-375
and A-673 cell lines.

isomerase  A 

contains 

ERP29_C  has  been  recently  characterised  as  a  novel  29
kDa  endoplasmic  reticulum  protein  that  is  widely
expressed in rat tissues. It plays an important role in the
processing of secretory proteins within the ER [38]. SK-N-
SH, A549, A-375, MCF-7 and Hela cells expressed ERP29
protein.

Prefoldin subunit 2 has a KE2 domain but profoldin sub-
unit  3  has  a  prefoldin  domain.  Two  of  them  were
expressed in Hela cells and profoldin subunit 2 was also
detected in SK-H-SH cell. The protein DUF704 is an acti-
vator  of  90  kDa  heat  shock  protein  ATPase  homolog  1.
This  protein  was  observed  in  bone  marrow  neuroblast-
oma (SK-N-SH) and Hela cells.

BAG-1 binds the ATPase domains of HSP70 and Hsc70,
modulating their chaperone activity and functioning as a
competitive  antagonist  of  the  co-chaperone  Hip.  The

human  BAG-1,  BAG-2,  and  BAG-3  proteins  bind  with
high affinity to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and inhibit
its  chaperone  activity.  All  these  proteins  contain  a  con-
served  45-amino  acid  region  near  their  C  termini  (the
BAG  domain)  that  binds  Hsc70/HSP70,  but  they  differ
widely  in  their  N-terminus  [39].  This  protein  was
observed in A549 and Hela cells.

GrpE protein homolog1 with GrpE domain and HSPC015
with DcpS domain were observed in A-673 and HL-60 cell
exclusively.

Major  differences  between  the  ten  tumor  and  the  three
normal cell lines were observed: 21 CH were observed in
tumor  cell  lines  only  and  vice  versa,  two  CH  were
expressed in three normal cell lines exclusively (see Addi-
tional files 1 and 2).

Discussion
The main outcome of the study is the generation of tumor
cell specific patterns of chaperone and heat shock protein
expression. The results form the basis for designing chap-
erone  protein  expression  studies  needed  to  evaluate  the
role of these structures in tumor biology by providing an
analytical tool for the concomitant determination of CH,
unambiguously  identifying  CH  by  a  protein  chemical
rather than an immunochemical technique, independent
of antibody availability and specificity.

It must be mentioned that only high abundance CH have
been detected by this method and that the generated indi-
vidual  maps  show  relative  abundance  proteins  only.  A
series of relatively abundant CH were presented by more
than one spot indicating the presence of splicing variants
or  posttranslational  modifications  including  glycosyla-
tion,  phosphorylation,  methylation,  oxidation,  trunca-
tion,  to  name  a  few  and  the  molecular  diversity  is
currently subject of detailed studies using advanced pro-
teomic tools as MS-MS sequencing and Q-TOF instrumen-
tation.  Carbamylation  during  sample  preparation  may
have been contributing to electrophoretic shifts as well

Methodologically, identification of proteins by MS-MS is
a sound approach and the major (inherent) problem with
the  interpretation  may  be  at  the  cell  culture  level:  the
standard protocols for cultivating the individual cell lines
according  to  the  supplier  were  followed,  but  the  condi-
tions for the individual cell cultures vary.

Different antibiotics or fungizides used may well lead to
differences  in  CH  expression  and  indeed,  the  use  of
geldanamycin  has  been  already  reported  to  induce  heat
shock  expression  in  brain  tissue  [40].  Other  tentative
confounding  factors  as  e.g.  cell  cycle  differences,  differ-
ences in growth and proliferation have to be taken into

account, but it was the aim of the study to examine CH
expression in cell lines in the absence of stressors or met-
abolic  derangement,  warranted  by  the  use  of  standard
protocols, wherefrom toxic effects are expected. Moreover,
a  list  of  non-tumor  cell  lines  has  been  studied  for  CH
expression already using this principle as well as compa-
rable analytical technique and this may allow some com-
parison  between  tumor  and  non-tumor  cell  line  CH
profiles.  Herein,  we  tested  three  more  normal  cell  lines
and  observed  a  large  number  of  differentially  expressed
CH  between  tumor  and  normal  cell  lineages.  We  are
aware of the fact that the already reported CH expression
patterns of five cell lines [41] and the three normal cell
lines  are  not  sufficient  to  find  out  differences  between
normal and tumor cell CH expression in general. We used
herein cell types widely used in life sciences as e.g. fibrob-
lasts, lymphocytes and kidney cells, that are representing
well-characterised normal cell lines. It may be impossible
to show specific differences between normal and tumor
cell  lines  as  the  stem  cells  from  which  tumor  cell  lines
originate are not generally known.

the  possibility  and  option 

Conclusions
Basically,  differences  between  individual  CH  expression
patterns may be due to different functional roles in indi-
vidual  cells  and  the  presence  of  specific  proteins  in  the
individual cell lineages: there are CH to specifically pro-
tect  individual  proteins  as  e.g.  specific  chaperoning  of
tubulin beta 1 by the TCP complex [42] and of procolla-
gen by HSP47 [43]. Differential CH expression may reflect
or lead to tumor biological characteristics including dig-
nity and carcinogenesis, and the method given herein pro-
vides 
these
characteristics  in  a  high-throughput  performance.  The
specific nature of cell line patterns is given by the observa-
tion that only heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein and TCP
zeta subunit protein were expressed non-specifically in all
ten  cell  lines  studied  and  previous  protein  expression
profiles  of  CH  in  tumor  cells  or  tissues  are  hereby
extended and confirmed. Absence of a CH in an individ-
ual cell line could be explained by poor resolution in an
individual gel but gel quality was checked by comparing
general  patterns  and  therefore  this  explanation  is  rather
unlikely

to 

test 

The main focuses in CH protein research maybe now to
investigate  detection  of  more  CHs,  probably by prefrac-
tionation into different compartments [44], to character-
ise the splice variants expressed at the protein level and to
evaluate  post-translational  modifications  that  may  be
responsible  for  a  significant  part  of  multiple  expression
forms.

Methods
Cell culture
Ten different tumor cell lines were purchased from Amer-
ican Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell lines and
their ATCC numbers are given in Table 3 (see Additional
file 4).

SK-N-SH (bone marrow neuroblastoma) and Hela (cervix
carcinoma) cell lines were grown in Minimum Essential
Medium (Eagle) with 2 mM L-glutamine and Earle's Basic
Salt  Solution  (BSS)  adjusted  to  contain  1.5  g/L  sodium
bicarbonate,  0.1  mM  non-essential  amino  acids,  and  1
mM sodium pyruvate, with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
The same conditions were used to culture the MCF-7 cell
line except for supplementing 10% FBS with 0.01 mg/ml
bovine  insulin.  HCT  116  (colorectal  carcinoma)  and
Saos-2 (osteosarcoma) cell lines were cultured in McCoy's
5a medium with 90% 1.5 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS.
Ham's F12K medium with 2 mM L-glutamine adjusted to
contain  1.5  g/L  sodium  bicarbonate  and  10%  FBS  were
used  for  the  A549  (lung  carcinoma)  cell  culture.  HL-60
(acute promyelocytic leukaemia) cells were cultured with
Iscove's  modified  Dulbecco's  medium  with  4  mM  L-
glutamine adjusted to contain 80% 1.5 g/L sodium bicar-
bonate and 20% FBS. A-673 (rhabdomyosarcoma), Caov-
3  (ovarial  adenocarcinoma)  and  A-375  (malignant
melanoma) cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 4 mM
L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbo-
nate and 4.5 g/L glucose with 10% FBS.

Three normal cell lines, fibroblasts, lymphocytes and kid-
ney cells were used:

Fibroblasts, Hs 545 SK ATCC CRL-7318 (Manassas, VA),
were obtained from human skin and grown in monolay-
ers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) con-
taining  4  mM  L-glutamine  adjusted  to  contain  1.5  g/L
sodium  bicarbonate,  4.5  g/L  glucose,  with  10%  fetal
bovine serum (FBS), Penicillin and Streptomycin (GIBCO
BRL)  according  to  standard  techniques  Lymphocyte  cell
line  3610  is  a  spontaneously  EBV  transformed  cell  line
from a patient with osteosarcoma and was obtained from
the  St.  Anna  Kinderspital-Forschungsinstitut  (Vienna,
Austria).  The  cell  line  was  established  from  peripheral
heparinized  blood  by  a  density  gradient  centrifugation
using Ficoll-Paque (AMERSHAM BIOSCIENCE, Uppsala,
Sweden) and grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 70 µM
gentamicin sulfate and 2 mM glutamine at a density of 2
× 106 cells per ml in 96 well plates.

HK-2 cells (Human Kidney 2) are proximal tubular epi-
thelial  cells  derived  from  normal  kidney  and  were
purchased from ATCC CRL-2190. Cells were cultured in
Keratinocyte-Serum  Free  Medium  (GIBCO-BRL  17005–
042) with 5 ng/ml recombinant epidermal growth factor

(positive  for  alkaline  phosphatase,  gamma  glutamyl-
transpeptidase, 
leucine  aminopeptidase,  acid  phos-
phatase, cytokeratin, alpha 3 beta 1 integrin, fibronectin;
negative for factor VIII-related antigen, 6.19 antigen and
CALLA endopeptidase) and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary
extract.

All  cell  cultures  were  maintained  in  a  humified  atmos-
phere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37°C and logarithmically
growing cells were harvested by trypsinisation.

(Merck,  Germany), 

Sample preparation
Harvested cells were washed three times with 10 mL PBS
(phosphate  buffered  saline)  (Gibco  BRL,  Gaithersburg,
MD, USA) and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 g at room
temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet
was suspended in 1 ml of sample buffer consisting of 40
mM  Tris,  7  M  urea  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany),  2  M
thiourea (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 4% CHAPS (3-[(3-
cholamidopropyl) 
dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sul-
fonate) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 65 mM 1,4-dithio-
erythritol 
EDTA
(ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid)  (Merck,  Germany),
protease inhibitors complete (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and  1  mM  phenylmethylsulfonyl  fluoride  (PMSF).  The
suspension was sonicated for approximately 30 sec in an
ice bath. After homogenisation samples were left at room
temperature for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 h.
The supernatant was transferred into Ultrafree-4 centrifu-
gal filter units (Millipore, Bedford, MA), for desalting and
concentrating proteins. Protein content of the supernatant
was quantified by the Bradford protein assay system [45].
The  standard  curve  was  generated  using  bovine  serum
albumin and absorbance was measured at 595 nm.

1  mM 

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
Samples prepared from each cell line were subjected to 2-
DE as described elsewhere [46]. 1 mg protein was applied
on  immobilised  pH  3–10  nonlinear  gradient  strips  in
sample cups at their basic and acidic ends. Focusing was
started at 200 V and the voltage was gradually increased to
5000 V at a rate of 3 V/min and then kept constant for a
further  24  h  (approximately  180,000  Vhs  totally).  After
the first dimension strips (18 cm) were equilibrated for 15
min in  a buffer containing 6 M urea, 20% glycerol, 2%
SDS, 2% DTT and then for 15 min in the same buffer con-
taining 2.5% iodoacetamide instead of DTT. After equili-
bration,  strips  were  loaded  on  9–16%  gradient  sodium
dodecylsulfate  polyacrylamide  gels  for  second-dimen-
sional separation. Gels (180 × 200 × 1.5 mm) were run at
40 mA per gel. Immediately after the second dimension
run, gels were fixed for 18 h in 50% methanol, containing
10%  acetic  acid,  the  gels  were  stained  with  Colloidal
Coomassie  Blue  (Novex,  San  Diego,  CA)  for  12  h  on  a
rocking  shaker.  Molecular  masses  were  determined  by

running  standard  protein  markers  (Biorad  Laboratories,
Hercules, CA) covering the range 10–250 kDa. pI values
were used as given by the supplier of the immobilised pH
gradient strips (Amersham Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden).
Excess of dye was washed out from the gels with distilled
water  and  gels  were  scanned  with  an  ImageScanner
(Amersham  Bioscience).  Electronic  images  of  the  gels
were  recorded  using  Adobe  Photoshop  and  Microsoft
Power Point softwares.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-MS)
Spots  visualised  by  Colloidal  Coomassie  Blue  staining
were excised with a spot picker (PROTEINEER sp™, Bruker
Daltonics,  Germany),  placed  into  96-well  microtiter
plates  and  in-gel  digestion  and  sample  preparation  for
MALDI analysis were performed by an automated proce-
dure  (PROTEINEER  dp™,  Bruker  Daltonics)  [44,47].
Briefly, all visible spots were excised and washed with 10
mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile in 10
mM  ammonium  bicarbonate.  After  washing,  gel  plugs
were  shrunk  by  addition  of  acetonitrile  and  dried  by
blowing out the liquid through the pierced well bottom.
The dried gel pieces were reswollen with 40 ng/µl trypsin
(Roche  Diagnostics,  Penzberg,  Germany)  in  enzyme
buffer  (consisting  of  5  mM  Octyl  β-D-glucopyranoside
(OGP)  and  10  mM  ammonium  bicarbonate)  and  incu-
bated for 4 h at 30°C. Peptide extraction was performed
with 10 µl of 1% TFA in 5 mM OGP. Extracted peptides
were directly applied onto a target (AnchorChip™, Bruker
Daltonics)  that  was  load  with  α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cin-
namic acid (CHCA) (Bruker Daltonics) matrix thinlayer.
The  mass  spectrometer  used  in  this  work  was  an
Ultraflex™  TOF/TOF  (Bruker  Daltonics)  operated  in  the
reflector for MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint (PMF)
or LIFT mode for MALDI-TOF/TOF with a fully automated
mode  using  the  FlexControl™  software.  An  accelerating
voltage  of  25  kV  was  used  for  PMF.  Calibration  of  the
instrument was performed externally with [M+H]+ ions of
angiotensin I, angiotensin II, substance P, bombesin, and
adrenocorticotropic  hormones  (clip  1–17  and  clip  18–
39). Each spectrum was produced by accumulating data
from  200  consecutive  laser  shots.  Those  samples  which
were  analysed  by  PMF 
from  MALDI-TOF  were
additionally analysed using LIFT-TOF/TOF MS/MS from
the same target. A maximum of three precursor ions per
sample  were  chosen  for  MS/MS  analysis.  In  the  TOF1
stage, all ions were accelerated to 8 kV under conditions
promoting  metastable  fragmentation.  After  selection  of
jointly migrating parent and fragment ions in a timed ion
gate, ions were lifted by 19 kV to high potential energy in
the  LIFT  cell.  After  further  acceleration  of  the  fragment
ions  in  the  second  ion  source,  their  masses  could  be
simultaneously analysed in the reflector with high sensi-
tivity.  PMF  and  LIFT  spectra  were  interpreted  with  the

Mascot software (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK). Data-
base searches, through Mascot, using combined PMF and
MS/MS datasets were performed via BioTools 2.2 software
(Bruker).  A  mass  tolerance  of  100  ppm  and  1  missing
cleavage site for PMF and MS/MS tolerance of 0.5 Da and
1  missing  cleavage  site  for  MS/MS  search  were  allowed
and  oxidation  of  methionine  residues  was  considered.
The probability score calculated by the software was used
as criterion for correct identification.

The algorithm used for determining the probability of a
false  positive  match  with  a  given  mass  spectrum  is
described elsewhere [48].
