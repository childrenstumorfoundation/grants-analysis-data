ABSTRACT
Background Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects 1 in
2500 people, and 15% of these may develop an optic
pathway glioma (OPG). OPGs behave differently in NF1,
and, given their frequency, surveillance is important.
However, this is difﬁcult because of the additional
complications these patients may have, such as learning
difﬁculties. Management is also different given that NF1
results from loss of function of tumour suppressor gene. A
genotypeephenotype correlation may help to determine
who is at risk of developing these tumours, aid focused
screening, and shed light on response to treatments.
Methods As part of a long-term follow-up study of
patients with NF1 OPGs, the authors assessed
genotypeephenotype correlation. Fluorescein in situ
hybridisation was performed to identify large deletions,
and then a full gene screen for mutations, by denaturing
high-performance liquid chromatography.
Results 80 patients with NF1 OPGs were identiﬁed, and
molecular analyses were performed in a subset of 29. A
clustering of pathogenic changes in the 59 tertile of the
gene was found. The authors combined these results
with those for another two NF1 OPG cohorts and
collectively found the same trend. When compared with
a control population of NF1 patients without an OPG, the
OR of a mutation being present in the 59 tertile was 6.05
(p¼0.003) in the NF1 OPG combined cohorts.
Conclusion It is possible that genotype is a signiﬁcant
determinant of the risk of development of OPGs in NF1.

around 5% of NF1 cases.8 9 Differences have been
observed in the natural history and effects of
treatment outcome of NF1 OPGs
compared
with sporadic OPGs,8 9 but the reasons for this
discrepancy are unknown.

Debate exists about the role and nature of visual
screening in the detection of NF1 OPGs, and the
presence of cognitive impairment makes it difﬁcult
for children to cooperate with visual testing. It is
difﬁcult to determine clinically and radiologically
which tumours will behave more aggressively and
require intervention. The identiﬁcation of the NF1
gene alterations that predispose to OPG formation
would facilitate focused screening of individuals at
risk of NF1 OPG. Potentially, genotypeephenotype
correlation could predict disease progression and
response to treatment.

We performed a long-term follow-up study of 80
patients with NF1 OPGs to determine the natural
history of these tumours, treatment outcomes and
psychosocial morbidity. These were largely symp-
tomatic OPGs and therefore the ones it would be
important to pick up early. This paper focuses on
the molecular aspect of the study, evaluating if

INTRODUCTION
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM 162200) is
a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder,
affecting multiple systems in both males and
females of every age and from every ethnic back-
ground.1 2 The NF1 gene is a tumour suppressor,
and loss of gene function due to somatic inactiva-
tion of both NF1 alleles leads to an increased risk of
developing benign and malignant tumours. NF1 is
a chronic, often progressive, disorder with wide-
spread manifestations, and approximately a third of
patients develop serious complications, mainly in
childhood. Neurological
include
cognitive impairment and central nervous system
tumours,
the most common being the optic
pathway glioma (OPG).3 4

complications

OPGs are detected in 15% of patients with
NF1,5e7 occurring predominantly in early child-
hood. However, they are only symptomatic in

METHODS
The molecular study was part of a case controlled
study involving patients ascertained from two NF1
clinics over an 18-month period. The Manchester
NF1 clinic is based in the regional Genetics Unit at
St Mary’s Hospital. In addition to diagnosis and
management of complications, all patients with
NF1 are offered annual review. A database of these
patients detailing their age, gender, family history
and manifestations is maintained. The second NF1
clinic is based at Guys Hospital, London. This is
a neurology-led multidisciplinary service, which
also has close links with genetics. A database of
name and date of birth was available, and, during
the study, details of gender and family history were
added for all patients on the database (650 notes
were available). Both clinics

group of NF1 patients. This study was performed before the
start of the NCG-funded complex NF1 service. Both the
Manchester and Guys NF1 clinics now also see patients with
NF1 OPGs referred from specialist centres as part of this NCG
service. Ethics approval for our study was sought independently
from each centre (Manchester 02/CM/432 and Guys 03/02/13).
Inclusion criteria for the molecular study were a conﬁrmed
diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH diagnostic criteria,
1988,10 suspected diagnosis of an OPG (made on clinical and/or
radiological features), and aged 16 years or more. In Manchester,
the Manchester Children’s Tumour registry (detailing cancer
diagnoses from 1954 in those under 15 years) was cross-checked.
The search for OPG included ‘juvenile astrocytoma’ and
‘neuroﬁbromatosis tumours not speciﬁed’ to achieve full ascer-
tainment. The OPGs were diagnosed on clinical and radiological
features, including visual impairment, changes on funduscopy,
pupillary alteration, proptosis or precocious puberty, or radio-
logical evidence such as thickening of the optic nerves with
enhancement. Few had histological conﬁrmation, as it is not
usual clinical practice to perform biopsies for these tumours. The
OPG diagnosis was reviewed during the natural history study
(details will be reported separately). An EDTA sample and
lithium heparin sample were collected from each patient for
molecular and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies,
respectively. A two-step procedure was used to detect muta-
tions. First, FISH was performed on all samples to look for any
large deletions in the NF1 gene.11 12 Then a full gene screen for
mutations was carried out, using denaturing high-performance
liquid chromatography (DHPLC).13e15

Interpreting the ﬁndings
Mutations were classiﬁed as pathogenic if they resulted in
a truncated protein, nonsense frameshift mutations, and splice-
site changes. Amino acid changes altering the protein sequence
(missense changes) were also classiﬁed as pathogenic if no single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected at this position
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), and they were not seen
in 1000 NF1 chromosomes and the same number of unaffected
control chromosomes. Family studies and functional analyses
were not possible during the course of the study, but these may
aid our interpretation of these changes further.

Polymorphisms were only considered to be non-pathogenic if
they were previously reported as an SNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/SNP/), were previously reported as a polymorphism,
had been found in normal controls, or were seen in association
with a pathogenic mutation in an affected individual (MU,
unpublished, 2004). It was not possible to check for the presence
of SNPs for the intronic changes, as sequence data were not
available, and these were not looked for in the normal controls.
The location of pathogenic changes identiﬁed in the NF1 gene
from the patients with NF1 OPGs was reviewed to evaluate
possible genotypeephenotype correlation. Our ﬁndings were
compared with mutations identiﬁed in another cohort of
patients with NF1 OPGs (Ars et al16). Both sets of results (ours
and those of Ars et al16) were then combined with a larger series
of NF1 patients (Castle et al17). This group (Castle et al17)
provided a control NF1/NF1 OPG group, in whom pathogenic
changes had previously been identiﬁed in a large cohort of
unselected NF1 patients, predominantly from the UK (MU,
unpublished, 2010).

A logistic regression analysis was then used to determine if the
OR of developing an OPG was associated with mutation loca-
tion. The outcome was presence or absence of OPG. For ease of
analysis, the NF1 gene was divided into tertiles of approximately

equal base pair length, using the NF1 introneexon boundaries as
dividing points. The 59 tertile included exons 1e16, the middle
tertile exons 17e30 (the GAP(GTPase activating protein) -related
domain is in exons 21e27a), and the 39 tertile exons 31e49. In
the logistic regression analysis, the tertiles were represented by
indicator variables. The middle tertile was the reference category
in comparisons between tertiles.

RESULTS
Table 1 summarises patient ascertainment in the overall long-
term follow-up study. Any pathogenic mutation was checked
against previous reports.13 14 18e22 Eighty patients with NF1
OPGs were identiﬁed from 1331 patients with NF1 known to
both centres. Of these, 47 were eligible for the molecular study
and 29 were recruited (subjects).

There were no signiﬁcant differences (in gender, age at diag-
nosis of NF1, or family history of NF1) between patients
ascertained from the two centres. During reassessment of the
OPGs as part of the natural history study, three patients were
shown not to have an OPG. Twenty-eight of the 29 subjects had
mutation analyses with DHPLC (table 2), as one patient was
identiﬁed as having a whole gene deletion by FISH.

One patient had a whole gene deletion, and a further 14 had
pathogenic changes, seven of which had not been described
previously. Of these, 10 were protein truncating (frameshift/
nonsense), two intronic changes, and the remainder were
missense changes. A total of 20 non-pathogenic changes were
seen, 15 previously unreported. Ten were polymorphisms, two
silent changes and eight intronic changes. Figure 1 depicts the
distribution of the pathogenic changes within the NF1 gene.
Clustering of changes was seen towards the 59 end of the gene.

DISCUSSION
Comparison with changes seen in previously reported patients
with NF1 OPGs
Our data suggest a clustering of mutations in the 59 region of the
NF1 gene. No mutation data were available in patients with NF1
OPGs when we started this study. Subsequently, during the
course of our study, Ars et al reported 12 mutations in a cohort
of 20 patients with NF1 OPGs, but no clinical information was
reported.16

We compared the molecular data from our patients with the
data reported by Ars et al (table 3, supplementary online mate-
rial). All of the changes described in the patients with OPGs by
Ars et al16 were shown to change mRNA processing, resulting in
truncated protein. Figure 2 shows the distribution of pathogenic

changes in the NF1 gene in both studies (ours and that of Ars
et al). Both studies show a clustering of mutations at the 59 end
of the gene, most likely to result in protein truncation.

As a comparison we also show the distribution of pathogenic
NF1 gene changes in a control group of patients with NF1 in ﬁgure
3. Here Grifﬁths et al23 identiﬁed pathogenic NF1 changes in 99
patients with NF1. Six of these had OPGs, and so their results are
not included in ﬁgure 3. It clearly shows that mutations in
patients with NF1 are distributed throughout the NF1 gene.

Mutation detection rate
Mutation testing in NF1 has not proven easy, with many past
studies reporting mutation detection frequencies of <50%. The
large size of the gene, the lack of hotspots, the diverse spectrum
of mutational mechanisms, and the presence of homologous loci
throughout the genome have hindered both the previous
methods available (including heteroduplex analyses, single-
stranded conformational polymorphism analyses, and the
protein truncation test) to ﬁnd changes, and, once found, the

interpretation of their role. DHPLC has been shown to be an
effective mode of mutation detection in NF1,13e15 and prior
FISH analysis will also detect deletions, the largest group of
changes missed with DHPLC.

The mutation detection rate was 52% by DHPLC, and with
FISH this was increased further, to 54%, for the 28 NF1 OPG
patients tested. No additional analyses such as RNA studies,
functional analyses or family studies were performed. These
studies might have shown that some of the intronic changes or
polymorphisms are disease-causing mutations. However, our
results are comparable to those of Ars et al16 who used single
strand conformation polymorphism/hetero-duplex (SSCP/HD)
analyses, followed by sequencing and characterisation of the
changes at the genomic level. They detected 12 mutations in 20
patients with NF1 OPGs, a mutation detection rate of 60%.

Assessing genotypeephenotype correlations
Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if the RR of
OPG was associated with the location of mutations in the NF1

gene. Patients with NF1 with identiﬁed mutations were ascer-
tained from three sources: 111 patients with NF1 from Castle
et al,17 nine of whom had OPGs; 12 patients with NF1 OPGs
from Ars et al16; and 15 patients with OPGs from this study. A
sample from one deceased NF1 OPG patient from Manchester,
ME13, showed him to have the same mutation as his mono-
zygotic twin, MS14, as would be expected. This result was also
included in this analysis, as part of our NF1 OPG cohort (hence
increasing our sample from 14 to 15 patients).

Thirteen patients from Castle et al17 were excluded from the
analysis (seven with large deletions, ﬁve with non-OPGs (ie,
gliomas outside of the optic pathway) and one with missing
information on glioma status). The resultant group was 125
patients, 36 of whom had an OPG. There were 104 families with
one patient, nine families with two patients (including one pair
of monozygotic twins), and one family with three patients. It
was not possible to adjust for familiality because of the small
number of families with more than one patient, but the type of
NF1 mutation (familial or de novo) has only a minor inﬂuence
on the variability of clinical expression in NF1.24 Therefore, each
patient was treated as a separate observation.

Mutations in the patients with OPGs from this study (15
patients including the results on the deceased twin discussed
above) were analysed with those found in the control group of
nine patients from Castle et al.17 Clustering in the 59 region was
apparent, but was not signiﬁcantly different from the control
population (Castle et al dataset17).

Addition of the patients with NF1 OPGs from Ars et al16
resulted in a signiﬁcant distribution of mutations in the 59 third
of the gene (OR 6.05, p¼0.003), and less so in the 39 region (OR

3.30, p¼0.066). These results suggest that, in the NF1 OPG
group, more pathogenic changes are seen 59.

Genotypeephenotype correlations for OPGs in NF1
Half (7/14) of the pathogenic changes detected in our study
were previously unreported. Although no mutation hotspots
have been identiﬁed, exons 4a, 4b, 10aec and 37 appear to
harbour more mutations,18 20 and ﬁve of our mutations
(including two unreported) were found in these exons. Further
support for the 59 predilection is provided by a report of siblings
with OPGs
nonsense mutation
(c484CAG/TAG; Q162X).25 The localisation of mutations at
the 59 end of the gene encompassing largely exon 1 to exon 15
may indicate a new genotypeephenotype correlation in
patients with NF1 OPGs, although further evaluation of this is
required.

Earlier research into such correlations has been limited partly
by the difﬁculty in ﬁnding mutations. Moreover, the large
phenotypic variability within NF1 families has indicated that
there are likely to be other modifying inﬂuences as well as
the underlying NF1 gene change. These include the role of
modiﬁer genes (epistasis), epigenetic factors and environmental
factors.24 26 27 We did not adjust for familiality in the one family
with identical twins with OPG, although clearly they will have
carried any modiﬁer genes in common.24 However, the contri-
bution of each of these factors in determining the NF1 pheno-
type is unknown, and may vary for different disease traits.
Furthermore, when a genotypeephenotype correlation in NF1
does exist, it may be difﬁcult to interpret because of the path-
ogenic heterogeneity, the complexity of the phenotype, and the

small number of patients examined. However, recently a number
of correlations have been suggested including: a mild phenotype
of café au lait patches only in patients with an in-frame dele-
tion28; multiple
spinal neuroﬁbromas with few other
features29 30; patients with NF1 with a 1.4 Mb microduplication
with mild learning difﬁculties, teeth and hair characteristics31;
and patients with NF1 and Noonan syndrome with potential
genotypeephenotype correlations with NF1 gene alterations.32
It may be that the genotype is a main determinant of the
development of OPGs in NF1. However, further evidence is
still required to conﬁrm our ﬁndings and the other potential
genotypeephenotype correlations.28 29 31 32

CONCLUSIONS
The apparent localisation of mutations at the 59 end of the NF1
gene appears to be a true feature of the mutations in NF1
patients with OPGs when compared with NF1 patients without
OPGs (mutations in 59 third of the gene, OR 6.05, p¼0.003).
Since the delineation of the whole gene deletion group in NF1,
this is the third molecular ﬁnding that may have a signiﬁcant
impact in the management of NF1 patients. However, these
ﬁndings require further conﬁrmation in a larger number of
patients with NF1 OPGs and understanding of the outcome of
these changes. Corroboration of these results may allow a more
targeted approach to screening for OPGs, by ﬁrst identifying
those patients at risk. Potentially, further clinical and molecular
studies may permit
the early identiﬁcation of aggressive
tumours and facilitate targeted treatment.
