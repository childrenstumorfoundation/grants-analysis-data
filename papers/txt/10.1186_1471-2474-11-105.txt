Abstract
Background: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) utilize parallel and 
related signaling pathways, however the interaction between these pathways in bone remains unclear. TGF-β 
inhibition has been previously reported to promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro, suggesting it may have a 
capacity to augment orthopaedic repair. We have explored this concept using an approach that represents a template 
for the testing of agents with prospective orthopaedic applications.
Methods: The effects of BMP-2, TGF-β1, and the TGF-β receptor (ALK-4/5/7) inhibitor SB431542 on osteogenic 
differentiation were tested in the MC3T3-E1 murine pre-osteoblast cell line. Outcome measures included alkaline 
phosphatase staining, matrix mineralization, osteogenic gene expression (Runx2, Alp, Ocn) and phosphorylation of 
SMAD transcription factors. Next we examined the effects of SB431542 in two orthopaedic animal models. The first was 
a marrow ablation model where reaming of the femur leads to new intramedullary bone formation. In a second model, 
20 μg rhBMP-2 in a polymer carrier was surgically introduced to the hind limb musculature to produce ectopic bone 
nodules.
Results: BMP-2 and SB431542 increased the expression of osteogenic markers in vitro, while TGF-β1 decreased their 
expression. Both BMP-2 and SB431542 were found to stimulate pSMAD1 and we also observed a non-canonical 
repression of pSMAD2. In contrast, neither in vivo system was able to provide evidence of improved bone formation or 
repair with SB431542 treatment. In the marrow ablation model, systemic dosing with up to 10 mg/kg/day SB431542 
did not significantly increase reaming-induced bone formation compared to vehicle only controls. In the ectopic bone 
model, local co-administration of 38 μg or 192 μg SB431542 did not increase bone formation.
Conclusions: ALK-4/5/7 inhibitors can promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro, but this may not readily translate to 
in vivo orthopaedic applications.

Background
Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are critical in the
formation of cartilage and bone. Osteogenic BMPs, such
as BMP-2, and -7 are widely recognized to promote an
osteogenic response [1]. Transforming Growth Factor-β
(TGF-β) belongs to the same superfamily as the BMPs,
although  its  role  in  bone  is  less  clear.  Both  BMPs  and
TGF-β  bind  to related  Type  I receptors (also  known  as

Activin  Receptor-like  Kinases  or  ALKs)  and  Type  II
receptors  and  activate  downstream  SMAD  signaling
pathways [2-4]. The osteogenic BMPs can bind to ALKs
1/2/3/6 and BMPRII or ActRII to induce phosphorylation
of  the  receptor-regulated  SMADs  (R-SMADs)  1/5/8.  In
the case of TGF-β and the non-osteogenic BMPs, ligand
binding  to  receptors  such  as  ALKs  4/5/7  and  TβRII
induces phosphorylation of R-SMADs 2/3.

There is conflicting evidence on the effects of TGF-β
signaling  on  bone  formation.  TGF-β 
isoforms  are
robustly expressed during the early stages of bone healing
[5,6], and exogenous TGF-β has been purported to aug-

ment  bone  markers  in  cultured  human  osteoblasts  [7]
and can lead to improvements in bone repair in ortho-
paedic  animal  models  [8-10].  However,  in  cultured
murine  cell  lines,  TGF-β  acting  through  SMAD3  was
reported to antagonize osteogenesis [11,12] and compa-
rable findings were found in human mesenchymal stem
cells [13]. Further work suggests that exogenous TGF-β
can delay osteogenesis in favor of chondrogenesis [14]. In
addition  to  direct  effects  on  osteogenic  differentiation,
TGF-β may also lead to increased fibrosis. In rodent dis-
traction  osteogenesis  and  fracture  models,  TGF-β1  and
TGF-β2 treatment (respectively) did not lead to improved
outcomes but did result in increased fibrous and cartilage
tissue [15,16]. In these studies, inflammation and edema
were also reported as unfavorable side-effects.

TGF-β signaling has also been linked to other fibrotic
conditions,  such  as  the  genetic  disorder  Marfan  syn-
drome.  Animal  models  with  aberrant  TGF-β  signaling
have  been  successfully  treated  with  TGF-β  neutralizing
antibody or with Losartan, a small-molecule angiotensin
II  AT1  receptor  blocker  (ARB)  [17-19].  ARBs  are  now
under trial for Marfans syndrome [20], and may be appli-
cable  for  other  TGF-β  related  disorders.  However,  the
affects of ARBs on TGF-β protein expression are indirect
and do not appear to translate to bone [21], thus making
these agents less attractive for orthopaedic applications.
In contrast, a novel synthetic compound, SB431542, has
been shown to rapidly and selectively inhibit ALK-4/5/7
but not ALK-2/3/6 kinase activity [22]. This enables the
blockade  of  the  classical  TGF-β-SMAD2/3  signaling
pathway  whilst  allowing  osteogenic  BMP-SMAD1/5/8
signaling.

In  a  seminal  study  by  Maeda  et  al.  (2004),  SB431542
repression  of  TGF-β  signaling  was  found  to  enhance
osteoblastic  differentiation  in  BMP-2  treated  C2C12
myoblasts  [23].  Osteoblastic  differentiation  and  matrix
mineralization  were  also  increased  in  cultured  human
mesenchymal stem cells. Based on these in vitro findings,
we  speculated  that  this  compound  may  also  be  able  to
positively influence bone formation or healing. As a puta-
tive anti-fibrotic agent, SB431542 could have additional
benefits in the context of orthopaedic repair where fibro-
sis is problematic.

In  this  study  we  have  used  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo
methods suitable for the rapid screening of compounds
specifically  for  orthopaedic  applications.  These  assays
represent  a  systematic  approach  that  can  be  readily
applied  to  other  putative  pro-osteogenic  agents.  In  cell
culture  experiments,  we  treated  the  MC3T3-E1  pre-
osteoblast  cell  line  with  purified  recombinant  BMP-2,
purified  TGF-β1,  and  the  TGF-β  receptor  inhibitor
SB431542,  individually  and  in  combination.  Outcome
measures included alkaline phosphatase (AP) and miner-
alization staining, osteogenic gene expression, and activa-

tion of downstream SMAD signaling pathways. Next, we
attempted  to  translate  the  effects  of  TGF-β  inhibition
using  animal  models.  This  included  a  marrow  ablation
model  (where  intramedullary  reaming  produces  bone
formation  over  a  10-day  period  via  intramembranous
ossification),  and  BMP-2  implantation  (where  ectopic
bone  nodules  are  induced  in  muscle  over  3  weeks  via
endochondral ossification). This study design represents
a  straightforward  methodology  for  testing  prospective
orthopaedic agents.

Methods
Cell culture methods
MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were grown in α-MEM media
containing  10%  FBS  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA).
Passage number 20 cells were used, and cultured for no
more  than  2  weeks  prior  to  initiating  differentiation.
Osteogenic differentiation was instigated by supplement-
ing media with 50 mg/L ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glyc-
erophosphate  (Sigma  Aldrich,  St  Louis,  MO,  USA).  All
culture media contained 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibi-
otics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomy-
cin) (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown in 37°C incubators
at 5% CO2 with media changes every 2-3 days. For stain-
ing experiments cells were plated in 48-well plates at 5 ×
104  cells/well.  For  cDNA  or  protein  collection  experi-
ments cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/
well. Cells were plated overnight and were sub-confluent
prior to the addition of drugs or recombinant proteins.

Recombinant proteins and drugs
Recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) (Medtronic Aus-
tralasia, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) was solubilized in
sterile water at stock concentrations of 100 μg/ml. Trans-
forming  growth  factor-beta  1  (TGF-β1)  was  purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (T1654), and reconstituted at 1 μg/
ml  in  filtered  0.1%  BSA  in  4  mM  HCl.  The  ALK-4/5/7
inhibitor  SB431542  was  purchased  from  Sigma  Aldrich
(S4317) and solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at
stock concentration of 10 mM. For in vitro experiments,
all wells received the same volume of DMSO (<0.1%) to
avoid  the  confounding  effects  of  DMSO  on  osteogenic
differentiation  [24].  PTH(1-34)  peptide  was  purchased
from Auspep (Parkville, VIC, USA).

Alkaline phosphatase (AP) and Alizarin Red S staining
Prior to staining, all cells were washed with PBS and fixed
with  4%  paraformaldehyde  (PFA).  AP  staining  was  per-
formed using a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml naphthol
AS-BI  phosphate  (Sigma  Aldrich),  0.5  mg/ml  Fast  Blue
(Sigma  Aldrich),  10%  N,N-dimethylformamide  (Sigma
Aldrich), 0.5% MgCl2 in 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.4) for 10 min at
room temperature [25]. Mineralization of calcium depos-
its was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining (40 mM, pH

4.2) (LabChem, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by multiple  washes  with distilled
water to remove background staining [26].
RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time 
quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitro-
gen). Equivalent amounts of total RNA were used to syn-
thesize cDNA by reverse-transcription using Superscript
III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). All samples were
amplified using the SYBR Green PCR reagent kit (Inte-
grated Sciences, Chatswood, NSW, Australia). PCR was
performed on the Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science,
Sydney,  NSW,  Australia).  PCR  primer  sequences  and
amplification conditions are as previously published [27].
PCR reactions were performed in quadruplicate and nor-
malized to the housekeeping Gapdh. Data are presented
as  mean  fold  induction  relative  to  untreated  cells,  with
the standard deviation shown in parentheses.
Western blotting
Cell extracts were harvested in SDS sample buffer, dena-
tured at 95°C for 10 min, separated by electrophoresis on
a  1%  SDS-PAGE  gel,  and  then  transferred  by  semi-dry
electroblotting to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA,  USA)  [27].  Immunoblotting  was  performed  with
anti-Smad1  and  anti-Smad2  (Zymed/Invitrogen),  anti-
pSmad1  and  anti-pSmad2  (Cell  Signaling  Technology,
Boston, MA, USA), and α-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) anti-
bodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-
rabbit IgG and sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibod-
ies were used (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Bucking-
hamshire,  UK).  Chemiluminescence  reagents 
(New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were used to visual-
ize the blots on X-ray film.
Surgical models
Experiments using mice were approved by the SWAHS
Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol 5031). In all studies,
8-10 week old C57BL6/J mice were used and anesthesia
was induced with inhaled isofluorane. Pain was managed
using  buprenorphine  (0.05-0.1  mg/kg)  subcutaneously
(s.c.) postoperatively (then every 12 hours as required).
Dehydration was managed by saline injection as required.
Marrow Ablation Model New intramedullary bone was
induced  by  femoral  reaming  as  previously  described  in
rats [28] and mice [29]. An incision was made on the right
hind  leg  lateral  to  the  knee  and  a  25G  needle  pushed
through the cortex of the distal femur between the inter-
condyles  and  unilaterally  up  the  medullary  canal  to
loosen the marrow. This needle was removed and 0.1 ml
of saline was injected into the cavity to flush out the mar-
row using a 30G needle. The wound was closed using 5-0
nylon suture (Ethicon). Mice were dosed  s.c. daily with
SB431542 in DMSO from the day of surgery until sacri-
fice at day 10. Control groups received an equivalent vol-
ume of vehicle (DMSO)  or the  bone  inducing agent 25

μg/kg/day PTH1-34 (Auspep). In an initial study, 1 mg/kg/
day  SB43152,  DMSO  control,  and  PTH1-34 groups  were
examined (N = 6). In a second study, a wider dose range
was used of 0.1 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/
day SB431542 (N = 6) with DMSO controls (N = 6) and a
nominal number of repeated PTH(1-34) controls (N = 2).
BMP-2 Implantation Model New  bone  formation  in  a
quadriceps muscle pouch was assayed after 3 weeks fol-
lowing  the  implantation  of  a  BMP-2  containing  pellet.
Pellets  containing  20  μg  recombinant  human  BMP-2
(Medronic  Australasia)  and  0  μg,  38  μg,  or  192  μg
SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich) were manufactured by solubi-
lizing Poly-(D, L-lactic acid) polymer (viscosity 0.55-0.75,
average  Mw  75000-12000,  Sigma-Aldrich)  and  drugs  in
ethyl acetate (analytical reagent grade, Chem Supply, Gill-
man,  SA,  Australia)  and  evaporating  the  solvent  under
vacuum.  The  BMP-2  dose  was  previously  determined
empirically  using  this  polymer  delivery  system  and  the
ratio of BMP-2/SB431542 was based on in vitro efficacy.
Pellets were molded by compression in a modified 0.3 ml
syringe.  Pellets  were  surgically  implanted  by  a  surgeon
experienced  in  mice  using  published  methods  [25].
Group sizes of N = 8 were used.

Radiographic analysis
The  bone  formed  in  both  models  was  examined  at  the
experimental  endpoint  using  a  digital  X-ray  machine
(Faxitron X-ray Corp., Wheeling, IL, United States).

To quantify  the  total bone mineral content (BMC) in
the  distal  region  of  reamed  and  unreamed  femora,
peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT)
and analysis was performed using a XCT-960A scanner
(Stratec Medizintechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). A region
spanning  the  midshaft  to  the  distal  femur  was  selected
after a pre-scan and measurements were taken from ten 2
× 5 × 0.2 mm slices using a red collimation mask. These
values were averaged and  for each mouse the reaming-
induced bone was normalized to the non-operated limb.
To quantify the total bone volume (BV, mm3) in each
BMP-induced bone pellet, micro Computed Tomography
(microCT) scanning was performed using SkyScan 1174
compact microCT scanner (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium).
The X-ray source voltage was set at 50 kV and beam cur-
rent set at 800 μA. To minimize the beam hardening arti-
facts a 0.5 mm aluminum X-ray beam filter was used to
attenuate soft X-rays at the source. Samples were scanned
at 8.7 μm resolution and 0.4° angular increments. Acqui-
sition time was approximately 30 minutes/specimen. BV
analysis was performed using CTAnalyser software, ver-
sion 1.9.2.3 (SkyScan). A global grey value threshold rep-
resenting new bone formation (47-255) was defined and
applied to all samples. Total bone volume was calculated
for  the  entire  pellet.  Representative  three-dimensional

bone  pellets  were  reconstructed  with  transaxial  slices
(100 slices) of the pellet's mid-section, using CTVol Real-
istic Visualisation software version 2.1.0.0 (SkyScan).

For statistical analysis of in vivo data, group sizes <10
necessitated  stringent  non-parametric  statistical  tests.
Kruskal  Wallis  and  Mann  Whitney  U  tests  were  per-
formed using SPSS Statistics version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chi-
cago, IL, United States).

Histological Analysis
Samples were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA and stored
in 70% ethanol. Bone was decalcified at room tempera-
ture  on  a  shaker  in  0.34  M  EDTA  (pH  8.0)  containing
0.5% PFA for 3 days, followed by 38 days in 0.34 M EDTA
(pH  8.0)  with  changes  every  3-4  days.  Samples  were
embedded  in  paraffin  blocks  and  5  mm-thick  sections
cut. Sections were stained with Picrosirius red and Alcian
blue for bone and cartilage.

Results
In vitro interactions of TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways
To  verify  the  capacity  of  TGF-β  signaling  to  modulate
osteogenesis we tested BMP-2, TGF-β, and the ALK-4/5/
7 inhibitor SB431542 in the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic
cell line that is commonly employed to model osteoblast
differentiation.  Without  treatment,  MC3T3-E1  cells
express the alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzyme at day 3,
and  matrix  mineralization  was  seen  at  day  10.  Matrix
mineralization in particular is an unambiguous marker of
mature  bone  cell  function.  Colorimetric  assays  were
selected to facilitate rapid screening. To further validate
the colorimetric assays, qPCR markers of early osteoblast
differentiation were also examined at 3 days and mature
markers at 10 days.

Dose  response  curves  were  performed  for  individual
agents (data not shown) and doses that showed sub-max-
imal  and  no  toxic  effects  when  given  individually  were
selected for further analysis in combination. As expected,
AP  (Figure  1A)  and  mineralization  stains  (Figure  1B)
were  suppressed  by  exogenous  TGF-β1  treatment  and
augmented with BMP-2 treatment. The SB431542 inhibi-
tor was found to be sufficient to promote osteogenic dif-
ferentiation in isolation and was able to produce additive
effects when co-treated with BMP-2. Neither SB431542
nor  BMP-2  could  individually  overcome  the  repressive
effects  of  TGF-β1  on  osteogenesis,  although  this  was
observed when they were used in combination. The com-
parable  outcomes  seen  for  AP  and  mineralization  indi-
cate  these  agents  do  not  have  differing  effects  on  early
osteoblast differentiation and mature osteoblast function.
In  a  subsequent  experiment,  cDNA  was  synthesized
from treated cells and this was analyzed by qPCR. Bone
genes included the early osteogenic/chondrogenic com-
mitment  factor  Runx2  (Table  A1A),  the  osteoblastic

Figure 1 Effects of TGF-β, BMP-2, and SB431542 on cultured 
MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Cells were grown and treated with 
agents (50 ng/ml BMP-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-β1, and 1 μM or 5 μM SB431542) 
and subjected to a rapid staining protocol that visually indicated os-
teogenic differentiation at 3 days (A, Alkaline Phosphatase) or matrix 
mineralization at 10 days (B, Alizarin Red S). These results confirmed 
that SB431542 can promote both early osteoblast differentiation and 
mature osteoblast function in vitro, and these results were indepen-
dently repeated. To confirm mechanistically the effects of these com-
pounds on downstream signaling (SMAD activity), Western analysis 
was performed on day 3 samples using pSMAD1, pSMAD2, SMAD1, 
SMAD2 and α-Tubulin antibodies. These data indicated that BMP-2 
and SB431542 could promote SMAD1 phosphorylation and reduce 
SMAD2 phosphorylation.

marker  Alp  (Table  B1B),  and  the  mature  bone  marker
osteocalcin (Ocn) (Table C1C). Gene expression profiles
reflected the AP and mineralization staining data results
with SB431542 able to augment osteogenesis alone and in
combination with BMP-2. These data reinforce the con-
cept that blockade of the ALK-4/5/7 receptors can aug-
ment  the  differentiation  of  committed  osteoprogenitors
in vitro.

Modulation of R-SMAD activity
While  BMP  and  TGF-β  can  mediate  strong  transient
changes in SMAD activity, particularly in serum starved
cells, we sought to determine the sustained activation of
SMADs  concomitant  with  osteogenic  differentiation  as
has been examined previously [23]. The phosphorylation
status of SMAD1 and SMAD2 were assayed as represen-
tative of the activity of the osteogenic (BMP-stimulated)
and  non-osteogenic  (TGF-β1  stimulated)  R-SMADs
respectively. Consistent with the onset of AP expression,
samples  were  collected  at  day  3.  The  phosphorylated
(pSMAD1,  pSMAD2)  forms  of  the  protein  were  exam-
ined by western blotting, with total SMAD1 and α-Tubu-
lin  included  as  a  loading  controls  (Figure  1C).  BMP-2
increased  pSMAD1  levels,  and  also  reduced  pSMAD2
levels.  While  the  classical  model  for  TGF-β1  signaling
indicates that it acts primarily via pSMAD2, we observed
in the MC3T3-E1 system that exogenous TGF-β1 treat-
ment suppressed pSMAD1 and that pSMAD2 levels were
unchanged.  SB431542  both  reduced  pSMAD2  and

Effects of SB431542 in a murine marrow ablation model
Healthy C57BL6/J mice underwent a surgical procedure
where the marrow cavity was reamed to promote fibrosis
followed by new bone formation. An in vivo dose of 1 mg/
kg/day  SB431542  was  initially  extrapolated  from  the
effective 2 μg/ml (5 μM) in vitro dose based on the ratio
of systemic PTH1-34 (25 μg/kg/wk) to an effective in vitro
dose of 50 ng/ml known to stimulate primary osteoblast
differentiation (data not shown).

In an initial screen to validate the model system, mice
were given DMSO vehicle alone, 25 μg/kg/day PTH(1-34),
or 1 mg/kg/day SB431542 with all drugs given s.c. Hind
limbs were harvested after 10 days and analyzed by X-ray,
histology, and pQCT scanning. X-ray images showed the
presence  of  additional  mineralized  tissue  within  the
intramedullary canals of reamed limbs, indicative of new
bone  formation  (Figure  2A).  Quantification  by  pQCT
showed consistent increases in BMC in the reamed limbs
compared to the non-operated limbs of DMSO treated (P
=  0.055),  SB431542  treated  (P  =  0.055),  and  PTH(1-34)

treated (P = 0.004) animals. These differences were more
evident in terms of new bone directly below the growth
plate  in  histological  sections  (Figure  2A).  Nevertheless,
neither  pQCT  nor  histology  showed  any  additional
improvement in marrow ablation-induced new bone for-
mation with SB431542 treatment (12% decrease in BMC
with SB431542 over DMSO, P = 0.26). In contrast, PTH(1-
34)  treatment  greatly  increased  bone  formation  in  the
reamed limbs (P = 0.055), and this was also seen histolog-
ically (Figure 2A). The strong effects seen with PTH(1-34)
validated the capacity of this model to reveal the effects of
potent bone anabolics.

In  a  second  experiment  a  wider  range  of  SB431542
doses were used (0.1-10 mg/kg/day). There was concern
that doses higher than 10 mg/kg/day could have toxic or
non-specific effects, as in vitro doses above 20 μM rapidly
induced cell death. For the analysis, to reduce the con-

experimental endpoint as misplacement or shifting of the
pellet had led to the ectopic bone fusing with the femur.
The bone volume of the entire pellet was visualized and
quantified  by  microCT.  The  low  dose  SB431542  group
showed a 47% reduction in bone volume compared to the
BMP-only  control  group  (P  =  0.06).  The  higher  dose
SB431542 group was comparable to the BMP-only group
(P = 0.21) (Figure 3A). Neither group supported the ini-
tial  hypothesis  that  SB431542  could  increase  BMP-2
induced  bone  formation.  For  representative  pellets,
transaxial  sections  in  the  centers  of  the  pellets  were
reconstructed to create 3 D models (Figure 3B).

Discussion
The study by Maeda et al. (2004) used an in vitro system
to characterize the response of myogenic progenitors to
BMP signaling and treatment with SB431542 [23]. They
showed that SB431542 enhanced the effects of BMP-2 on
osteogenesis and that this was associated with increased
SMAD1 signaling and decreased SMAD2 signaling. Our
data using the MC3T3-E1 cell line supports a pro-osteo-
genic effect of SB431542 on pre-osteoblasts, even in the
absence of exogenous BMP-2. In terms of a screening sys-
tem  for  novel  compounds,  the  MC3T3-E1  system  is
rapid,  low-cost,  and  suitable  for  generating  rapid  dose
response  curves.  Due  to  limitations  with  this  cell  line
[30,31], prospective agents should also be trialed on pri-
mary  mesenchymal  stem  cells,  however  in  the  case  of
SB431542 this data was already available [23]. Maeda et al
also  examined  the  expression  of  I-SMADs  (inhibitory
SMADs), which are downstream negative regulators of R-
SMAD signaling, and showed a suppression of SMAD6
and SMAD7 by SB431542 with prolonged treatment [23].
While I-SMADs represent potentially important modifi-
ers of R-SMAD signaling, they are transcriptionally regu-
lated by and secondary to the initial R-SMAD response.
Our in vitro data indicates that BMP and TGF-β signals
can modulate R-SMAD signaling in a non-canonical fash-
ion. Specifically, ALK-4/5/7 inhibition led to increases in
pSMAD1 levels and BMP-2 treatment led to a reduction
in pSMAD2 levels (Figure 1).

In this study we have also employed two rapid surgical
models to screen for pro-osteogenic effects in a bone for-
mation/bone repair context. The first was a marrow abla-
tion  model  previously  described  in  the  context  of
biglycan null mice that show decreased bone formation
following  reaming  [29].  We  adopted  a  high-resolution
multi-slice pQCT scanning approach for quantification,
which was found to give more accurate results than indi-
vidual sections that were more susceptible to positional
effects. We confirmed that reaming consistently induced
new bone formation in all groups. PTH(1-34) administra-
tion further increased the amount of bone on the reamed
side, validating the model system. In contrast, SB431542

This model utilizes femoral reaming to induce new bone formation 
with femora harvested at day 10. Representative X-rays and histologi-
cal sections (A) of DMSO vehicle, 1 mg/kg/day SB431542, and 25 μg/
kg/day PTH1-34 treated groups are shown. Radiographs illustrate an 
overall increase an intramedullary bone with reaming throughout the 
operated limb, particularly with PTH1-34 treatment. This is also seen be-
low the growth plate (oriented to the left) in histological sections with 
bone stained with Picrosirius red. To test and quantify the effects of a 
range of inhibitor doses in this model, DMSO vehicle, 0.1-10 mg/kg/
day SB431542, and 25 μg/kg/day PTH1-34 treated groups were analyzed 
by pQCT (B). The marrow ablation-induced bone was analyzed by cal-
culating the average BMC of reamed limbs relative to unreamed limbs. 
Only PTH1-34 treatment created a significant increase in reaming-in-
duced bone formation (P = 0.05).

to DMSO controls (Figure 2B). SB431542 treatment did
not  have  an  effect  on  BMC  in  the  non-operated  limb.

Effects of SB431542 in a BMP-2 induced bone formation 
model
As  an  alternative  method  for  inducing  bone  formation,
PDLLA  polymer  pellets  containing  BMP-2  were
implanted  intramuscularly  in  quadriceps  of  C57BL6/J
mice.  In  addition  to  the  BMP-only  control  group,  two
other groups were supplemented with low dose (92 μg)
and high dose (384 μg) SB431542. The BMP-2 doses were
based on previous experience with the model system [25]
and  local  SB431542  doses  were  extrapolated  from  the
ratio of BMP-2:SB431542 used in vitro. Bone formation
occurred over 3 weeks. Two mice were excluded at the

Figure 3 Radiographic analysis of the BMP-2 implantation model. This model uses 20 μg BMP-2 implanted into the hind limb to induce ectopic 
bone formation in 3 weeks. The effects of local SB431542 co-delivery were quantified by microCT measurement of bone volume in the entire bone 
pellets (A). Relative to BMP-2 alone, SB431542 did not increase bone formation (47% decrease, P < 0.06 for 92 μg SB431542; 25% decrease, P < 0.21 
for 384 μg SB431542). This is further illustrated by representative microCT reconstructions of bone nodule cross-sections.

did not produce any substantive pro-osteogenic effect in
reamed bones or in non-operated limbs.

The second model was a BMP-2 intramuscular implan-
tation model [25], which contains an endochondral bone
formation component. Again, no significant increase was
observed  in  bone  formation  with  SB431542  treatment,
rather a trend was seen towards reduced bone with local
dosing (Figure 3).

The  lack of  a  beneficial effect  of  the  TGF-β  inhibitor
SB431542 in the in vivo models may be due to several rea-
sons. One possibility was an inappropriate dose selection,
although  higher  doses  were  likely  to  non-specifically
affect other receptors. In a previously published study, a
single  dose  of  0.2  mg/kg  was  used  to  affect  metabolic
changes in rats [32], indicating that our dose range of up
to 10 mg/kg/day should be capable of producing signifi-
cant  physiological  effects  in mice.  This  SB431542 com-
pound  has  also been successfully  used  in organ  culture
experiments to produce developmental effects [33]. Nev-
ertheless, 
the  specificity  and/or  bioavailability  of
SB431542  may  be  suboptimal  for  in  vivo  studies,  and
there  certainly  exists  the  potential  for  more  specific
inhibitor compounds to produce improved results.

An alternative explanation for the disparity between in
vitro and in vivo results may be due to the fundamental
differences  between  the  techniques  and  outcome  mea-
sures in the different systems. Cell culture models focus
primarily on the process of cell differentiation, generally
on committed bone cells [11-14,23]. In contrast, surgical
models  also  incorporate  elements  of  osteoprogenitor

recruitment and proliferation. In the context of TGF-β,
this may be critical as TGF-β release has been recently
shown to play a major role in the recruitment of osteo-
progenitors  for  bone  homeostasis  [34].  Thus  our  study
may highlight a basic limitation of in vitro systems and
stress the utility of expediting screens with surgical mod-
els such as the marrow ablation or BMP-2 implantation
model.

Conclusions
Our data confirms that TGF-β inhibition can enhance the
differentiation of committed osteoprogenitors in culture,
and  these  effects  were  additive  with  BMP-2  treatment.
However, these cell culture phenomena did not translate
into  increased  bone  formation  in  a  marrow  ablation  or
BMP-induced ectopic bone models. This may be due to
effects of TGF-β on osteoprogenitor recruitment that are
not modeled in vitro. Findings from marrow ablation and
BMP-2 implantation models suggest that sustained global
TGF-β suppression with SB431542 is likely to be ineffec-
tive for orthopaedic applications.
