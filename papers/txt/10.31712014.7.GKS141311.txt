Object. The significance of radiation in the induction of malignancy in vestibular schwannomas (VSs) after 
radiosurgery is unclear despite an increasing number of case reports. The authors describe a new case of verified ma-
lignant transformation in a vestibular schwannoma (MTVS) and provide a new evaluation of such cases previously 
reported in the literature.

Methods. A 46-year-old woman underwent subtotal resection of a right-sided VS in 2004. The histological char-
acteristics of the lesion were typical and benign. In early 2007 Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) was performed to treat a 
residual enlarging remnant. The radiosurgery parameters included the following: target volume 3.5 cm3, prescription 
dose 12 Gy, prescription isodose 45%, maximum dose 26.7 Gy, and coverage 97%. At 2 years’ follow-up the lesion 
was enlarged to 5.2 cm3, but by 5 years it had decreased to 2.3 cm3. Six months later the lesion was 8.4 cm3. Repeated 
surgery was performed, and a histological analysis revealed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The case was 
further managed with repeated GKS performed in the spring of 2013. At that time, the radiosurgery parameters in-
cluded the following: target volume 3.5 cm3, prescription dose 16 Gy, prescription isodose 45%, maximum dose 35.6 
Gy, and coverage 91%. This Gamma Knife Department has treated a total of 205 patients with VS (local incidence of 
MTVS 0.49%). A search of the literature published up to and including 2013 was performed using PubMed as well 
as more informal search methods.
Results. This patient is the 29th reported case of MTVS after radiation therapy. Of these cases, 40.7% were 
patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). In those cases in which histology showed tumors with previously benign 
characteristics, totally conforming to the criteria for MTVS, the mean delay to malignant expression was 68 months 
(median delay 72 months). The authors also retrieved papers reporting 30 cases of malignant VS in patients who had 
not undergone radiation treatment. Five of those cases were malignant transformation of a benign entity, and in 4 of 
them histology had verified that the initial disease was benign. In those 4 cases, there was a mean delay to malignant 
expression of 7.2 months (median delay 8 months).
Conclusions. Despite more frequent reports of MTVS after radiation treatment recently, there has been no ac-
curate quantification of the risk, except in patients with NF, in whom the incidence of malignancy is high in relation 
to the numbers treated. The present analysis indicates that the risk of malignancy over 20 years in cases in which no 
radiation treatment has occurred is 1.32–2.08 per 100,000, and this risk decreases to 1.09–1.74 per 100,000 if cases of 
NF are excluded. After radiation treatment, the overall risk over 20 years is 25.1 per 100,000, and this risk decreases 
to 15.6 per 100,000 if cases of NF are excluded. Radiation treatment increases the risk by approximately 10 times in 
non-NF cases.

malignancy is high in relation to the number of patients 
treated.5 An  excellent  population  study  of  nearly  5000 
cases from Sheffield, England,47 suggested that there was 
no increased rate of malignancy of any kind after radio-
surgery, but naturally such a study will not detect events 
with a probability of less than 1:5000.

Malignant transformation after radiosurgery

Prompted by the occurrence in our department of a 
case of an MTVS that conformed fully to Cahan’s criteria 
for radiation-induced tumors,7 we conducted a literature 
search to identify other cases and compiled a list signifi-
cantly larger than previous reviews.

Case Report

A 46-year-old woman with no evidence of NF2 pre-
sented with impaired hearing in 2003, and in mid-2004 
underwent  subtotal  resection  of  a  right-sided  vestibular 
schwannoma (VS). The histological characteristics of the 
tumor were benign. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited 
a House-Brackmann Grade IV facial paresis and had no 
residual hearing on the right side.

In  2007  a  residual  enlarging  tumor  remnant  was 
noted on MR imaging and GKS was performed. The ra-
diosurgery parameters at the time included the following: 
target volume 3.5 cm3, prescription dose 12 Gy, prescrip-
tion isodose 45%, maximum dose 26.7 Gy, coverage 97%, 
Paddick Conformity Index 0.8, and Gradient Index 3.0. 
At the 2-year follow-up in 2009, MR imaging showed 
that the lesion had enlarged to 5.2 cm3, but by 2012 it had 
decreased to 2.3 cm3. Six months later, an MR imaging 
examination showed that the lesion had grown rapidly to 
8.4 cm3. Repeated partial excision was performed, and 
a new histological analysis revealed a malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) with MIB-1 positiv-
ity  in  30%  of  the  cells.  Immunohistochemical  analysis 
of the tumor cells showed a general positive reaction for 
vimentin and a focal positive reaction for S-100 protein, 
but negative reactions for CD56, CD34, EMA, and GFAP. 
The delay in onset from radiosurgical treatment to pre-
sentation of malignant transformation totaled 66 months.
In the spring of 2013 the surgical remnant was treat-
ed again with GKS. The radiosurgery parameters at that 
time were as follows: target volume 3.5 cm3, prescription 
dose  16  Gy,  prescription  isodose  45%,  maximum  dose 
35.6 Gy, coverage 91%, Paddick Conformity Index 0.7, 
and Gradient Index 2.8. In 2014, at the patient’s 6-month 
follow-up examination, no change in the tumor was found, 
and no new cranial nerve or other neurological deficit had 
developed.
A literature search was performed using the terms ma-
lignant, transformation, radiosurgery, vestibular, acoustic, 
schwannoma,  neuroma,  and  malignant  peripheral  nerve 
sheath tumor/MPNST on PubMed together with a search 
and  cross-check  using  Google  Scholar.  In  addition,  de-
tailed contents of the publications retrieved in the search 
were cross-checked, because in some instances the same 
cases were reported in more than one journal by different 
authors.

Results

A total of 59 cases of MPNST of the vestibular nerve 
were reported in the literature: 29 cases occurred after 
radiation treatment, 25 cases arose spontaneously, and 5 
cases occurred after surgery for benign disease. The de-
tails  of  these  cases  are  summarized  in  Tables  1–3.  The 

J Neurosurg / Volume 121 / December 2014  

two largest collected series reported previously included 
23 cases57 and 35 cases.32 Of the 29 cases of MPNST that 
occurred after radiation treatment, 11 (40.7%) of 26 pa-
tients in whom there was available information suffered 
from  NF  (Table  1).  The  average  patient  age  was  40.4 
years; 14 patients were female, 10 were male, and gender 
was  not  stated  for  the  remaining  5  patients.  The  histo-
logical appearance of the tumor was MPNST in 19 pa-
tients, triton tumor in 3 patients, rhabdomyosarcoma in 1 
patient, and MPNST with sarcomatous differentiation in 
4 patients. In 2 cases the histological type of lesion was 
not clarified, but the progression was clearly malignant. 
Twenty-six cases had been treated by stereotactic radio-
surgery (SRS) and 3 others by other forms of radiation 
therapy. In only 9 cases had histology proved the tumor 
benign before radiation treatment was performed. In the 
other cases there was no biopsy or the histological find-
ings were not recorded. The overall mean delay from ra-
diation treatment to malignant expression was 85 months. 
In those cases with documented prior benign histological 
findings that totally conformed to Cahan’s criteria,7  the 
mean delay from radiation treatment to malignant expres-
sion was 68 months. The criteria for malignant transfor-
mation, as originally outlined by Cahan et al.,7 are as fol-
lows: 1) benign histological type must be proven before 
irradiation; 2) there must be a prolonged latency period, 
usually greater than 4 years, between radiation delivery 
and tumor development; 3) the tumor must arise in the ir-
radiated field; 4) the tumor must be histologically distinct 
from the original tumor; and 5) the patient must not have 
a genetic predisposition to the development of cancer.
Of the 30 cases that occurred without previous radia-
tion treatment, 5 (17%) of 29 patients suffered from NF 
(Tables 2 and 3). Thirteen patients were female, 14 were 
male, and sex was not stated for 3 patients. The average 
age of these patients was 43.2 years in the 25 patients in 
whom malignancy occurred spontaneously and 59 years 
in the 5 cases of MTVS. The histological tumor appear-
ance was MPNST in 23 patients, triton tumor in 4 pa-
tients, and MPNST with melanomatous differentiation in 
3 patients. In 4 cases the histological findings had proved 
to be benign at some time before the malignant condition 
appeared, and in these cases the mean delay to malignant 
expression was 7.2 months.
The chronology of published reports on the various 
cases was analyzed by dates of publication, and the re-
sults are shown in Table 4. It is evident that the incidence 
of cases in the three 5-year periods beginning in the year 
2000 (43 cases) is approximately 3 times greater than the 
incidence of cases in the three 5-year periods before 2000 
(15 cases). The millennium year, 2000, occurred 10 years 
after significant numbers of radiosurgical treatments for 
VS began to be performed.

Discussion

The case that we have described represents the 9th 
reported  case  of  MTVS  after  radiation  treatment  that 
conforms fully to Cahan’s criteria and the 29th case of 
MPNST occurring after radiotherapy or radiosurgery.
The topic most in need of evaluation is the determi-

nation of the significance of radiation in the induction of 
malignancy, which up to now has not been quantified pre-
cisely.  With  reported  numbers  of  malignant  VSs  in  the 
radiation-treated population being the same as the num-
bers of malignant VSs in the immensely larger, non–ra-
diation-treated population, the effect of radiation is clear. 
However, there may be a relative tendency to report cases 
involving previous radiation treatment more frequently. It 
is inevitable that the conclusions of this paper depend on 
the accuracy and comprehensiveness of reporting.
The population incidence of VS has been calculated 
to be between 12 and 19 per million people per year.3,55 
Assuming an even prevalence and an average world pop-
ulation of 6 billion between 1990 and 2014, the number 
of VSs that develop globally per year would range from 
72,000 to 114,000. In relation to the number of cases that 
have been reported, the chance of developing a spontane-

ous malignancy over 20 years would be 30 in 1.44–2.28 
million  or  between  1.32  ×  10-5 and 2.08  ×  10-5.  If  only 
the 25 non-NF cases are considered, the chance would be 
between 1.09 × 10-5 and 1.74 × 10-5.
In cases of VS treated by radiation the risk needs to 
be  related  to  the  total  population  treated.  According  to 
Leksell Gamma Knife Society (LGKS) reports,33 the to-
tal number of GKSs for VS reported worldwide between 
1991  and  2012  was  70,353.  A  survey  by  the  Acoustic 
Neuroma Association in 2012 showed that 39% of radia-
tion  treatments  were  fractionated  and  61%  were  single 
fraction.1 If one postulates that the proportion of single-
fraction  treatments  represents  GKSs  and  the  remaining 
treatments were delivered by other methods, and if one 
assumes  that  the  ratio  in  the  United  States  applies  to 
the  rest  of  the  world,  then  the  total  number  of  patients 
with VS treated by radiation worldwide could be around

115,333.  The  overall  risk  of  MPNST  over  20  years  is 
therefore 29 in 115,333 or 25.1 × 10-5. If patients with NF 
are excluded from this analysis, there remain 18 patients 
whose MPNST was associated with radiation treatment, 
and thus the risk for malignant transformation in the ab-
sence of NF is accordingly 15.6 × 10-5. This represents 
a 9 to 14 times increased probability of malignancy in 
relation to that spontaneous incidence of between 1.09 × 
10-5 and 1.74 × 10-5.
An independent study in patients with NF revealed 
that in a population of 1348 patients with NF2, 106 would 
have  received  radiosurgery.5  Malignant  transformation 
occurred in 5 of these cases. This corresponds to a risk of 

TABLE 3: Malignant transformation of a benign entity

4717 × 10-5, a substantially greater risk than that found in 
patients who do not have NF. We found a greater propor-
tion of patients with NF in the group of patients treated 
with  radiation,  which  is  compatible  with  the  increased 
susceptibility of NF cases to radiation.
There are certain other prominent differences between 
cases treated with radiation and cases not treated in this 
manner. The first is the delay or latency from diagnosis to 
malignant expression. In cases in which radiation was de-
livered, this is 68 months (in cases of initial benign disease 
confirmed by histology) or 85 months (in all cases) com-
pared with 7.2 months in cases in which there was no radia-
tion treatment and there was a prior histological diagnosis

of  benign  disease.  This  would  suggest  that  the  cases  in-
volving radiation treatment are showing the delay required 
by the Cahan criteria for malignant induction, whereas the 
cases without radiation treatment are already in the process 
of malignant expression. Table 1 shows that 2 cases involv-
ing  radiation  treatment20,25  had  an  insignificant  delay,  6 
months for 1 case and 7 months for the other, and therefore 
may not be cases of true malignant transformation due to 
radiation, even though one of these patients20 had histologi-
cally defined benign disease before SRS.
In  addition,  the  group  of  patients  with  previous  ra-
diation  treatment  contains  a  larger  proportion  of  cases 
in  which  histology  revealed  a  sarcomatous  element  (8 
[29.6%] of 27 cases) than the group with no previous ra-
diation treatment (4 [13.3%] of 30 cases). Sarcomatous 
differentiation is known to be associated with irradiation, 
and the overall incidence of post–irradiation sarcoma in 
patients  who  survive  longer  than  5  years  following  ra-
diation therapy is approximately 0.1%.27 This pattern of 
sarcomatous change also suggests that the malignant pro-
gression is due to radiation, although it is appropriate to 
point out that the rate of malignancy after radiosurgery 
for VS is 10 times less than that expected after radiation 
treatment of peripheral bone or soft tissue.27
Finally, there is evidence from the chronology of pub-
lications (Table 4) that there has been a 3-fold increase in 
case reports since the year 2000. If a delay period of 5 
to 8 years, according to Cahan’s criteria, is added to the 
decade of 1990, when significant numbers of radiosurgi-
cal treatments began to be performed, then an increase in 
reported cases of MTVS would be expected from 2000 
onwards if radiation is a significant predisposing factor 
for  malignant  progression.  As  has  been  noted  earlier, 
there may be a tendency to report MTVSs more readily 
than spontaneous malignant VSs. It could also be argued 
that the armamentarium and expertise of neuropatholo-
gists has improved together with a general explosion in 
the  number  of  published  medical  papers.  Nevertheless, 
the  sudden  change  in  the  reported  numbers  of  MTVSs 
after the year 2000 seems significant.
Although the available information clearly indicates 
that there is a real chance of malignant transformation due 
to SRS, both the medical community and patients should 
be  reassured  that  the  risk  is  very  low.  The  calculations 
above enumerate the risk value as 15.6 × 10-5 or 0.016% 
in the absence of NF. This compares favorably with a re-
alistic mortality rate after craniotomy of between 1% and 
2%.9,49 Although there are a few smaller surgical series of 
selected cases in which there were no deaths,52 it is not re-

alistic to expect a surgical series of 10,000 cases without 
some mortality, and this is the number of cases required 
for a comparative result.

Conclusions

Despite more frequent reports of MTVS after radia-
tion therapy, there has been no previous accurate quanti-
fication of the risk, except in cases of NF in which the in-
cidence of malignancy is high in relation to the numbers 
treated. The present review indicates that the risk of ma-
lignancy over 20 years in cases in which no radiation was 
used is 1.32–2.08 per 100,000, and this decreases to 1.09–
1.74 per 100,000 if cases of NF are excluded. The analysis 
of published cases reveals that after radiation treatment 
the  overall  risk  over  20  years  is  25.1  per  100,000,  and 
this decreases to 15.6 per 100,000 if cases of NF are ex-
cluded.  Radiation  treatment  therefore  increases  the  risk 
by approximately 10 times in non-NF cases.
