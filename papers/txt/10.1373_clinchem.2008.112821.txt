Microarray-Based Genomic DNA Profiling Technologies in

Clinical Molecular Diagnostics

Yiping Shen1,2,3 and Bai-Lin Wu1,3,4*

BACKGROUND: Microarray-based genomic DNA profil-
ing (MGDP) technologies are rapidly moving from
translational research to clinical diagnostics and have
revolutionized medical practices. Such technologies
have shown great advantages in detecting genomic im-
balances associated with genomic disorders and single-
gene diseases.

CONTENT: We discuss the development and applica-
tions of the major array platforms that are being used in
both academic and commercial laboratories. Although
no standardized platform is expected to emerge
soon, comprehensive oligonucleotide microarray
platforms— both comparative genomic hybridization
arrays and genotyping hybrid arrays—are rapidly be-
coming the methods of choice for their demonstrated
analytical validity in detecting genomic imbalances, for
their flexibility in incorporating customized designs
and updates, and for the advantage of being easily man-
ufactured. Copy number variants (CNVs), the form of
genomic deletions/duplications detected through
MGDP, are a common etiology for a variety of clinical
phenotypes. The widespread distribution of CNVs
poses great challenges in interpretation. A broad survey
of CNVs in the healthy population, combined with the
data accumulated from the patient population in clin-
ical laboratories, will provide a better understanding of
the nature of CNVs and enhance the power of identi-
fying genetic risk factors for medical conditions.

SUMMARY: MGDP technologies for molecular diagnos-
tics are still at an early stage but are rapidly evolving.
We are in the process of extensive clinical validation
and utility evaluation of different array designs and

Human DNA mutations range from single-nucleotide
changes to whole-chromosome alterations. At the
small-size end of the mutation spectrum, de novo
changes in single base pairs occur at the rate of about
1.7 ⫻ 10⫺8 per base pair per generation (1 ). It is esti-
mated that there are 2 nonsilent point mutations in
each newborn (2 ). At the large-size end of the mutation
spectrum, alterations in chromosome number causing
aneuploidy affect about 0.3% of live births (3 ). In be-
tween are microscopic and submicroscopic genomic
rearrangements involving different segments of chro-
mosomes that may affect many genes or exons of a
gene. The de novo rate of mutation of copy number
variants (CNVs)5 in each newborn has been estimated
as 1 in 8 for deletion and 1 in 50 for duplication (2 ),
which are between the rates for de novo point muta-
tions and chromosomal aneuploidy. Recent studies
have shown that the human genome contains many
CNVs (4 –7 ), which are the result of a distant (inher-
ited) or current (de novo) loss or gain of genomic
sequences.

A portion of these alterations will produce a
change in the human phenotype and in extreme cases
will cause abnormal development and medical condi-
tions. The purpose of clinical genetic diagnostics is to
detect such mutations effectively and to correlate these
changes with corresponding medical conditions. Vari-
ous methods have different resolutions that reveal dif-
ferent sizes of genomic imbalance (Fig. 1).

Point mutations can be detected effectively with
the Sanger sequencing method after specific amplifica-
tion of target regions by the PCR. The detection of
chromosomal aneuploidy and large rearrangements
are within the repertoire of traditional cytogenetics.

Fig. 1. Various methods with different resolutions detect different sizes of genomic changes.
Point mutations (changes in single or multiple base pairs up to kilobase pairs) can be detected with Sanger DNA sequencing.
Karyotyping can detect large chromosomal rearrangements with low resolution (down to 5 Mb). FISH provides much higher
resolution (down to 100 kb) for detecting submicroscopic genomic imbalances, but it interrogates only selected loci at one time.
MLPA and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) complement FISH and DNA sequencing, but all of these methods suffer from a low
information content, limited throughput, and the requirement of choosing candidate targets before the test. Microarrays [BAC
and oligonucleotide (oligo)] are capable of detecting both microscopic and submicroscopic copy number changes for the whole
genome in a single assay. The high-resolution microarrays (oligo CGH arrays and SNP hybrid arrays) provide the most efficient
means to identify genomic imbalance widely (down to kilobase pairs and approaching base pair resolution).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) represents a
merging of cytogenetic techniques with molecular
technology. Such a merger and its applications in the
clinical setting were necessitated by the discovery of a
set of submicroscopic genomic imbalances associated
with specific clinical manifestations
(collectively
known as microdeletion and microduplication syn-
dromes), but this method interrogates only selected
loci at a time. Other techniques designed to detect copy
number changes, such as multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) and real-time PCR, are
complementary to those of FISH and DNA sequencing,
but all of these methods suffer from low information
content, limited throughput, and the requirement of
choosing candidate targets before the test.

Microarray-based genomic DNA profiling (MGDP)
technologies are capable of detecting both microscopic
and submicroscopic copy number changes for the whole
genome in a single assay. They provide unprecedented
sensitivity and cost-effectiveness for a large group of mu-
tations that have evaded conventional approaches, and
they are changing clinical practices. MGDP may be used
as a first-tier tool in clinical genetics for many conditions
previously evaluated via conventional cytogenetic ap-
proaches. We review the current status and some consid-

erations regarding the clinical applications of MGDP
technologies.

Development of Genomic DNA
Profiling Microarrays

Microarrays have been widely used for gene expression
analysis in the past decade; however, it is worth men-
tioning that DNA microarrays were initially designed
for interrogating vast amounts of genomic sequence
polymorphisms and variants. The intention to use mi-
croarrays for diagnostic purposes was deeply rooted
from the very beginning. There are 2 major microarray
platforms for genomic DNA profiling— comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays and genotyping
arrays—which were developed in parallel yet interac-
tively. Regardless of the technical differences in chip
manufacturing and probe types used with these plat-
forms, they share the same principle and rely on the
specific hybridization of target and probe sequences.
CGH arrays use a 2-color scheme. The method infers
the copy number changes in a test sample by compar-
ing it with a reference sample. Genotyping arrays, on
the other hand, do not use a control sample; rather,
they use the intensity of the hybridization signal to in-

dicate the relative DNA copy number. In addition,
genotyping arrays provide information on single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes.

TRANSFORMATION OF CGH MICROARRAYS FROM LOW-

RESOLUTION TARGETED BAC ARRAYS TOWARD WHOLE-GENOME

HIGH-DENSITY OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS
CGH was first reported by Kallioniemi et al. in 1992 to
interrogate cancer genomic DNA with metaphase
chromosomes as probes (8 ). The basic strategy of the
technique is to differentially label the DNA from cancer
cells and the DNA from healthy reference cells with
different fluorochromes and to cohybridize the labeled
samples to a metaphase spread from a healthy reference
cell. The ratio of the intensities of the 2 fluorochromes
reflects the copy number differences between cancer
cells and healthy cells. Because this technique uses
metaphase chromosomes as probes for hybridization,
it is now also called “chromosome CGH.” In essence,
chromosome CGH is similar to FISH painting, which
uses labeled DNA from the entire genome as the probe
set. This technology permits a genome-wide survey and
identifies the genomic imbalance at different regions of
specific chromosomes. Although chromosome CGH
has demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting larger
genomic imbalances in the cancer genome, the detec-
tion power has ultimately been limited by the resolu-
tion of a metaphase chromosome.

The major breakthrough in CGH came from
microarray technology about a decade ago. Instead of
hybridizing labeled genomic targets to metaphase
chromosomes, the new scheme uses cloned genomic
DNA as probes in a microarray format. Because these
probes contain sequence information that permits
their specific localization in the human genome, the
regions with a genomic imbalance can be delineated
by data-visualization software that denotes all of
the probes along the genome. The resolution of
microarray-based CGH, which is determined by the
density and size of the probe, is a substantial improve-
ment over chromosome CGH.

The first CGH microarray, termed matrix CGH,
was developed in 1997 by Solinas-Toldo et al. with cos-
mid and plasmid artificial chromosome clones as
probes (9 ). Subsequently, bacterial artificial chromo-
some (BAC) clones (10 ) and cDNA clones (11 ) were
used to construct CGH microarrays. Subsequent im-
provements were focused on increasing the probe
density and array coverage, as well as improving the
signal-to-noise ratio.

The most recent advancement in CGH microar-
rays has been the use of oligonucleotide sequences as
probes (12 ). Compared with BAC arrays, oligonucleo-
tide arrays have several advantages, including:

1. Reproducibility. As opposed to BAC arrays, in which
the content of the probe (i.e., PCR product of a BAC
clone) varies from batch to batch, the probe sequences
in oligonucleotide arrays are uniformly defined and de-
void of highly repetitive sequences. Consequently, oligo-
nucleotide arrays are more reproducible.
2. Sensitivity and specificity. The smaller interprobe
spacing of oligonucleotide arrays offers a much higher
probe density for better detection of smaller genomic
imbalances and more accurate breakpoint mapping,
therefore providing much improved sensitivity over
BAC arrays. The fact that oligonucleotide probes are
selected from the reference human genome sequence
allows all users to use any sequence of interest as a po-
tential target, providing a specificity that is impossible
with BAC arrays, in which clones can be selected only
from existing libraries and need to be validated for their
physical location.
3. Customization. Oligonucleotide probes are syn-
thesized in situ on the arrays, allowing for easy cus-
tomization of content. In addition, many commercial
manufacturers offer a large number of preselected ar-
ray CGH oligonucleotide probes and computer inter-
faces, making custom design and updating of CGH
arrays quite feasible and fast for clinical laboratories,
whereas BAC arrays are cumbersome to update and
time-consuming for printing.
4. Robustness and reliability. The substantially in-
creased capacity of oligonucleotide arrays enables
multiprobe confirmation for a single event (the detec-
tion sensitivity and specificity are a function of consec-
utive probes), as well as increased robustness because
the higher signal-to-noise ratios provide higher confi-
dence in CNV diagnosis (13–15 ).

IMPROVEMENT OF GENOTYPING ARRAYS FROM LOW-

RESOLUTION SNP ARRAYS TO HIGH-RESOLUTION HYBRID

ARRAYS THAT INTEGRATE SNP AND CNV PROBES
Whereas CGH arrays successfully combine microarray
technology with CGH, genotyping arrays for CNVs
arose from SNP arrays that were originally designed for
sequencing (16 ), genotyping (17 ), and gene expression
(18 ). These SNP arrays with short oligonucleotides
were developed by Affymetrix with their proprietary
photolithographic technology (19 ). Since then, the
density of SNP arrays has been growing constantly. The
DNA chips designed to genotype 10 ⫻ 103, 50 ⫻ 103,
100 ⫻ 103, 500 ⫻ 103, and even more SNPs have al-
lowed improved detection resolution.

At about the same time that Agilent Technologies
developed long oligonucleotide– based whole-genome
CGH arrays with their ink-jet technology (20 ), Af-
fymetrix SNP arrays demonstrated their ability to
detect changes in genomic copy number in addition
to genotyping (21–23 ). Similarly, Illumina used a

different manufacturing approach in commercializing
BeadChips for genotyping and copy number analysis
(24 ).

Table 1 lists the currently available oligonucleotide-
array platforms for genomic DNA profiling. Reduced
manufacturing costs, unprecedented detection power,
and the feasibility of custom design/updates have made
these arrays attractive in basic and translational research.
The major advance in genotyping arrays for
genomic profiling is the development of hybrid geno-
typing arrays, i.e., the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Hu-
man SNP Array 5.0 and the latest 6.0 version, which
combines SNP probes for genotyping with CNV
probes for detecting changes in copy number (25 ). The
SNP Array 5.0, which is the prototype of the hybrid
array, contains 500 000 SNP probes for genotyping and
420 000 nonpolymorphic probes for CNV analysis.
Among the nonpolymorphic probes, 320 000 probes
were chosen to provide even spacing across the ge-
nome, concentrating on areas not represented by

662 Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009)

SNPs, and the remaining 100 000 probes covered 2000
known CNVs (50 probes per CNV). The SNP Array 6.0
has 906 600 SNP probes, 744 000 copy number probes
evenly spaced along the genome, and another 202 000
probes that target 5700 previously reported CNV re-
gions. Thus, a single 6.0 array offers a total of 1.8 mil-
lion probes for simultaneous SNP genotyping, CNV
analysis, and loss-of-heterozygosity detection.

Although the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 (hybrid
arrays) is mainly a research tool at the moment, many
diagnostics laboratories are actively validating this
platform for clinical applications. Although long-
oligonucleotide CGH arrays do not have as many
probes as short-oligonucleotide genotyping arrays, the
signal-to-background dynamic range is generally bet-
ter with long-oligonucleotide CGH arrays; however,
the rich genotyping information, in addition to the
CNV data offered by the hybrid arrays, provides addi-
tional value to the platform. For instance, the genotyp-
ing data simultaneously provide information regarding

the parent of origin for the detected de novo CNV if
parental samples have also been examined. The most
important advantage of the hybrid arrays is their ca-
pability of detecting copy number–neutral genomic
rearrangements, namely uniparental disomy (UPD),
through loss-of-heterozygosity analysis. In the long
run, the genotyping information can be used for SNP-
association analysis.

Translational Research and Applications of MGDP
Technologies for Patient Samples

MGDP technologies have been used extensively in clin-
ical and translational research for interrogating patient
samples. These studies provided crucial information
about clinical utility before their diagnostic applica-
tions. A recent review by Stankiewicz and Beaudet (26 )
summarized the applications of microarrays for CGH,
primarily dealing with low-resolution or targeted BAC
arrays in the evaluation of patients with dysmorphic
features, developmental delay, and/or idiopathic men-
tal retardation. The published data produced with dif-
ferent array platforms and patient cohorts indicate an
overall detection rate for pathogenic genomic imbal-
ance of patients with multiple congenital anomalies
and/or developmental delay/mental retardation of
12%–18%. Only 3%–5% of such patients can be de-
tected by G-banded karyotyping, and an additional
9%–13% can be detected by microarray-based tests
(26 ). As expected, the detection rate is higher with
whole-genome tiling arrays than with targeted arrays.
A series of such studies overwhelmingly verified the
superior sensitivity and detection power of array CGH
compared with karyotyping and FISH analysis. As
mentioned above, the most important advance in array
CGH is replacing BACs with oligonucleotides. Simi-
larly, short-oligonucleotide arrays have also been vali-
dated against and found superior to BAC arrays.

INTERROGATING SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS AND HEALTHY

INDIVIDUALS WITH OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS
Oligonucleotide CGH arrays became commercially
available in 2004 and now include platforms from Agi-
lent Technologies (20 ), NimbleGen (27 ), Affymetrix
(28 ), and Illumina (24 ) (Table 1). In-house spotted-
oligonucleotide arrays (29 ) and custom-designed oli-
gonucleotide CGH arrays (13, 14, 30 –32 ) have also
demonstrated high sensitivity and reproducible detec-
tion of genomic imbalance in testing with samples
from patients and healthy individuals. Consequently,
many laboratories have shifted from BAC arrays to oli-
gonucleotide arrays (15 ). Some diagnostic laboratories
that provide large-scale services are now using oligonu-
cleotide arrays for clinical diagnostics.

The initial

implementation of oligonucleotide
CGH arrays for clinical applications focused on tar-
geted pathogenic genomic regions. Shen et al. devel-
oped targeted oligonucleotide arrays that used Agilent
custom arrays to interrogate 179 clinically relevant
genomic loci (14 ). The multiplex arrays demonstrated
results that were 100% concordant with the findings
from BAC arrays, showing very high sensitivity. In ad-
dition, smaller genomic imbalances that were not de-
tectable by BAC arrays were reliably detected with this
oligonucleotide-array system (14 ). Similarly, Ou et al.
emulated BAC arrays with oligonucleotide probes and
created an array of 44 000 oligonucleotides that veri-
fied an enhanced ability for detecting copy number
changes compared with BAC arrays (13 ). In addition
to showing the superior analytical sensitivity of oligo-
nucleotide arrays compared with BAC arrays, these
studies
convenience of
oligonucleotide-array design and manufacturing.
Aradhya and Cherry used samples from 20 patients
with dysmorphic features, developmental delay, or
mental retardation to directly compare the perfor-
mance of whole-genome BAC arrays of 1-Mb resolu-
tion (Spectral Chip 2600; PerkinElmer) with that of
Agilent whole-genome oligonucleotide CGH arrays
of 35-kb resolution (33 ). All of these patients had a
typical karyotype. Ten clinically important genomic-
imbalance events were detected with the oligonucleo-
tide arrays, whereas only 6 were detected with the BAC
arrays. The study clearly demonstrated the superior ef-
fectiveness of the oligonucleotide arrays. Because of the
large size of the BAC clones and the widespread nature
of CNVs, BAC arrays provide very low specificity for
detecting CNVs. Conversely, oligonucleotide arrays
avoid repeat sequences via the selection of probes that
avoid nonspecific regions.

also demonstrated the

With the intention of improving the capture of
frequent subtelomeric imbalances associated with
developmental delay/mental
retardation, custom-
designed oligonucleotide CGH arrays were developed
with improved coverage in subtelomeric regions. Ex-
ploiting the design concept used earlier in BAC arrays
(34 ), Toruner et al. (32 ) randomly removed one third
of the probes from an off-the-shelf Agilent whole-
genome CGH array of 44 000 probes and replaced
them with 14 000 subtelomeric probes. The resulting
arrays provided 5-kb resolution in subtelomeres and
125-kb resolution in the remaining genome. The oligo-
nucleotide CGH array– based molecular ruler (31 ), an-
other design that emerged at nearly the same time, pro-
vided 50-kb resolution for subtelomeric regions and
75-kb resolution for the rest of the genome. This array
detected a subtelomeric genomic imbalance of 10.9%
and a pathologic imbalance of 4.7% genome wide in
clinical samples (30 ). These custom designs provide

enhanced coverage for clinically relevant regions, as
well as decent coverage for the rest of genome for better
measurement of the sizes of imbalance events.

Compared with oligonucleotide CGH arrays,
fewer clinical applications have been studied on geno-
typing arrays. Friedman et al. used the Affymetrix 100K
SNP arrays to investigate genomic imbalance (28 ).
Eight control trios that included the unaffected parents
and an affected child with a previously recognized
chromosomal abnormality or UPD were studied. The
Affymetrix array detected the known abnormalities in
all control cases, including 4 cases of UPD. The array
also detected de novo deletions as small as 178 kb
among 100 idiopathic mental-retardation patients
with a typical karyotype. In addition, Ming et al. used
the 50K Xba chip from the Affymetrix 100K array set
for a similar study of patients with multiple congenital
anomalies (35 ). Although both studies illustrated the
sensitivity and detection power of Affymetrix arrays for
investigating genomic imbalance, the analytical sensi-
tivity and cutoff for detecting copy number–neutral
UPD have yet to be firmly established.

Flexible probe selection permits easy design of oli-
gonucleotide arrays that can detect deletions and du-
plications at the exon level of specific genes (Table 2).

develop exon-level microarrays, the current manufac-
turing technology for oligonucleotide arrays has sim-
plified the process so that it is more accessible to ordi-
nary laboratories. These custom-designed,
target
gene–specific arrays detect duplication as effectively as
deletion at the single-exon level, with more precise
breakpoint mapping (39 – 44 ). Targeting panels of
genes associated with one disease at the exon level is
attractive for molecular diagnostics.

GENOMIC IMBALANCES IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex, per-
vasive developmental-delay disorders characterized by
impairments in communication, social interaction,
and behavior. Studies of twins have suggested a strong
genetic component to ASD. Thus far, few contributory
genes have been identified, but cytogenetic changes
have been one of the most consistent identifiable causes
of autism. Changes detectable by high-resolution
G-banding have been reported in 3%–5% of autism
patients (45 ), involving the chromosomal regions at
2q37, 5p15, 11q25, 16q22.3, 17p11.2, 18q21.1, 18q23,
22q11.2, 22q13.3, and Xp22.2p22.3 (46 ). MGDP is a
powerful new venue for exploring the complex nature
of ASD genetics. Jacquemont et al. (47 ) used whole-
genome 1-Mb BAC CGH arrays to interrogate 29 syn-
dromic autism patients with typical karyotypes and
found that more than a quarter of the patients showed
spontaneous pathogenic copy number changes. The
size of the imbalances ranged from 2 Mb to 17.3 Mb.
This study highlighted the immense effectiveness of ar-
ray CGH in genetic analysis of patients with autism. It

also demonstrated that extensive genomic imbalances
are an important underlying cause of syndromic ASD.
In another study that used oligonucleotide arrays
with much higher resolution, Sebat et al. (48 ) revealed
the importance of de novo CNVs as genetic risk factors
for sporadic ASD. Subsequent studies have provided
further evidence to support the notion that copy num-
ber changes are strongly associated with idiopathic
ASD (49 –55 ). Array technology has detected patho-
genic CNVs in 5.8%–10.2% of sporadic ASD patients
(Table 3), whereas the rate is consistently low in famil-
ial ASD patients (2%–3%). This finding suggests that
there are 2 different ASD genetic mechanisms: sporadic
ASDs are more likely to be caused by de novo deletions
or duplications, whereas familial ASDs are more likely
to be due to other types of inherited mutations. Array
studies with consanguineous families further demon-
strated the existence of recessive gene mutations that
are largely not genomic deletions or duplications (56 ).
Collectively, these studies clearly demonstrate the
clinical value of genomic profiling in the evaluation of
autism. It is strongly evident that the detection yield of
MGDP is much more consistent and higher than tra-
ditional cytogenetic techniques (57 ).

Clinical Validation and Diagnostic Applications of
MGDP Technologies

CLINICAL VALIDATION—SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY
As for any new technology, systematic validation is re-
quired before MGDP can be used for routine clinical

applications (14, 58, 59). The validation process should
test all aspects of a new technology, but most impor-
tantly the sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity and
specificity are often tested by means of a positively test-
ing cohort with known mutations that have been iden-
tified with a well-accepted technology. In the case of
MGDP, results from karyotyping and FISH studies are
often used. Typically, sensitivity testing examines the
false-negative rate, and specificity testing inspects the
false-positive rate; however, several aspects of MGDP
validation are unique.

Microarray technology is analog in nature. The
change in genomic copy number is reflected by a
change in signal intensity or a color shift (red vs green)
of the microarray features (probe spots). The first crit-
ical step is to define the analytical resolution, i.e., the
size of CNV that can be detected reliably. Assuming
that the feature-analysis software is well established for
each array platform (not necessarily the case), CNV
calling depends on the algorithm used. Owing to the
different array platforms and probe densities, the ana-
lytical resolution of each array needs to be specifically
defined. It is important to note that sensitivity and
specificity vary, depending on the number of consecu-
tive probes examined. Higher sensitivity and specificity
can be achieved when more consecutive probes are
used. In addition, the signal-to-background ratio for a
deletion or duplication changes with the array plat-
form, the labeling chemistry, and the hybridization
protocol. Thus, it is necessary to define an appropriate
threshold for each clinical-array design. For example,

chromosomal mosaicism is not so rare in patients with
birth defects and mental retardation. BAC arrays have
found 8% of abnormal findings to be mosaic muta-
tions; however, different array platforms have different
sensitivities for detecting mosaicism (60 – 62 ).

Because microarray technology has much higher
resolution than karyotyping and FISH, its analytical
resolution cannot be assessed by karyotyping or
FISH. In many cases, additional CNVs not detectable
by karyotyping or FISH were identified with array
technologies. Therefore, other technologies covering
smaller-scale mutations, such as MLPA, real-time PCR,
or even PCR/sequencing, should be used for validation
purposes (14 ).

CLINICAL VALIDATION—PLATFORM PITFALLS
It is also necessary to check for missing spots on the
array that may be clinically important. For example,
some commercial arrays do not cover the pseudochro-
mosomal regions of chromosomes X and Y. On the
other hand, poor-performing probes (mismapped or
poorly hybridizing probes) should be taken out of the
array (59 ). The latter action is particularly necessary in
BAC arrays because one mismapped or poorly hybrid-
izing clone will appreciably affect detection sensitivity
and specificity. Most of these poorly hybridizing BAC

666 Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009)

clones may contain low-copy repeats. Thus, the pres-
ence of low-copy repeats is more of a problem in the
BAC probe than the oligonucleotide probe, whereas
oligonucleotide probes that do not perform well may
contain secondary structure. Identifying such bad
probes and removing them will improve array perfor-
mance considerably (14 ). Although such probes can-
not be removed from commercial chips, posthybrid-
ization data analysis (data filtering) can provide an
alternative solution for amending this problem.

It has been suggested that a minimum of 30 ab-
normal samples be used for clinical validation (58 );
however, the region and size of the genomic im-
balance that the abnormal cases cover are more im-
portant than the actual number. Ideally, every probe
should be evaluated with abnormal samples. For this
purpose, aneuploidy cell lines, as well as samples
with well-defined genomic imbalances of different
sizes, are very valuable.

UNDERSTANDING CNVs
The most important issue for array interpretation in clin-
ical genetic testing is to define the nature of the identified
CNVs (63). In general, CNVs can be categorized into 3
major groups: CNVs with established pathogenicity
(pCNVs), i.e., deletions/duplications that overlap with re-

Microarrays in Clinical Molecular Diagnostics

Reviews

gions associated with defined genomic disorders or dis-
rupt known disease genes; CNVs of a benign nature
(bCNVs), i.e., deletions/duplications repeatedly observed
in nonpathologic individuals and with no evidence of an
association with any particular clinical phenotype; and
CNVs with unknown importance (uCNVs), i.e., dele-
tions/duplications without an established association
with any genomic disorder and involving genes of unclear
clinical importance [(14, 30, 65–70), Table 4]. Even when
bCNVs and uCNVs are intentionally avoided during ar-
ray design, a large percentage of the identified imbalances
often belong to bCNVs or uCNVs, because a substantial
number of novel CNVs are still being discovered
(Table 4).

We anticipate that many of CNVs of currently un-
known importance (uCNVs) will eventually be con-
firmed as bCNVs as more precise knowledge about
their locations, distributions, and frequencies
in
healthy populations becomes available. Meanwhile, the
accumulating evidence from clinical (phenotyping),
genetic (inheritance and segregation), and functional
(gene content and expression) studies may reveal a
portion of these uCNVs to be pathogenic. We believe
that uCNVs are a rich source for identifying novel ge-
netic risk factors for a variety of medical conditions.

Our understanding of CNVs will certainly im-
prove with systematic CNV-discovery efforts (64 ).
At the same time, continued studies of genotype–
phenotype association are also essential. Public data-
bases such as DECIPHER (https://decipher.sanger.
ac.uk/) represent such an effort. In the meantime,
many novel CNVs are being discovered in clinical sam-
ples with the help of high-resolution whole-genome
arrays. Databases derived from clinical samples are also
a rich source for evaluating genotype–phenotype cor-
relations. Eventually, this knowledge will make it pos-
sible to minimize the detection of bCNVs and maxi-
mize the detection of clinically important regions.

CLINICAL-DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY
The first-generation arrays designed for clinical use
were targeted BAC CGH arrays developed in house at
the Baylor College of Medicine (34 ) and Signature
Genomic Laboratories (71 ). Both arrays were designed
to cover regions of known genomic disorders, as well as
all subtelomeric regions. Array-CGH and FISH results
showed 100% concordance. In addition, array CGH
detected changes missed by prior karyotyping or FISH.
A similar design was also available commercially, the
Constitutional Chip by Spectral Genomics (72 ). The
Constitutional Chip also included backbone clones to
cover the rest of the genome with an interval of about
1 Mb. Since that time, more BAC clones (from 589 to
⬎4600) have been selected to cover additional clini-
cally relevant regions (approximately 40 –150 recog-

nized genomic disorders/syndromes), improving de-
tection rates from 5.6% in the first-generation BAC
arrays to 10.8% in later arrays (68, 73 ).

The clinical utility of oligonucleotide arrays has
not yet been evaluated in large clinical studies; how-
ever, the current data indicate that the detection rate is
higher than for BAC arrays (Table 4). High-resolution
whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays have identified
small novel microdeletions and microduplications in
16p11.2 that are associated with mental retardation/
autism (50, 53 ), have helped to circumscribe critical
regions such as 17q21.31 (74 ), and have identified in-
tragenic deletions/duplications in large genes, such as
PARK2 [Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, juve-
nile) 2, parkin] and DMD (dystrophin) (Y. Shen et al.,
unpublished data).

Common clinical indications for MGDP-based di-
agnostics testing include developmental delay, multi-
ple congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, unex-
plained mental retardation, seizure disorders, ASDs,
and other neurologic/psychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia, as well as prenatal diagnosis, including
spontaneous abortion or fetal demise.

Conclusion and Future Development

Microarray-based clinical molecular diagnostics technol-
ogies such as MGDP have gone beyond the stage of “co-
ordinated and concurrent FISH analysis” (75) and ex-
tended into loss-of-heterozygosity testing and possibly
methylation profiling. Current MGDP technologies are
capable of detecting genomic imbalances of any size but
do not reveal positional or orientational information.
FISH analysis has largely been responsible for providing
positional information. FISH is also instrumental in test-
ing for translocations in parental samples for de novo
CNVs that have been identified in probands. MGDP has
much better resolution than FISH, however. The field
would benefit immensely from a tool with the localization
capability of FISH and the resolution of whole-genome
oligonucleotide arrays. Advanced next-generation se-
quencing platforms may eventually provide digital profil-
ing for detecting copy numbers and positional alterations
simultaneously. Therefore, DNA-diagnostics profiling
may soon extend beyond microarray-based technology,
from analog analysis to digital analysis.
