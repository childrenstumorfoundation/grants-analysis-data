1. Introduction

This paper summarizes the nodal level results from the VVER MSLB core simulation in the NURESAFE EU
project. The main objective is to implement and verify new developments in the models and couplings of
3D core simulators for cores with hexagonal fuel assemblies. Recent versions of the COBAYA and DYN3D
core physics codes, and the FLICA4 and CTF thermal-hydraulic codes were tested standalone and coupled
through standardized coupling functions in the Salome platform. The MSLB core transient was analyzed
in coupled code simulation of a core boundary condition problem derived from the OECD VVER MSLB
benchmark. The impact of node sub-division and different core mixing models, as well as the effects of
CFD computed core inlet thermal-hydraulic boundary conditions on the core dynamics were explored.

The analysis of main steam line break (MSLB) reactivity tran-
sients is a challenging task because of the strongly pronounced
local 3D effects in the core and the reactor pressure vessel (RPV)
and correspondingly the need for detailed modeling of both the
neutronics and the coolant mixing. The VVER-1000 MSLB simula-
tion has been subject of the OECD VVER-1000 Coolant Transient
Benchmark – V1000CT-2 (Kolev et al., 2006). The analysis of the
benchmark results indicated the potential for improving the qual-
ity of simulation through the use of enhanced models of the ﬂow
mixing and the 3D core dynamics.

This article presents the full-core nodal-level simulation results
from the VVER MSLB work package in the NURESAFE EU project. As
stated in the NURESAFE description of work (Chanaron, 2012;
Chanaron et al., 2015) the main objective of the work on the VVER
MSLB situation target was to develop and execute simulation
schemes towards higher-resolution. Speciﬁc objectives were to test
new developments in the nodal and pin-by-pin models and
couplings for VVER applications, as well as CFD and CFD/system
code simulation of the RPV with enhanced prediction capability.
This paper concentrates on the nodal core models which can be

supplemented by pin-power reconstruction (PPR) and application
of CFD computed core boundary conditions. The results from pin/
pin models, sub-channel thermal-hydraulic analysis and coupled
COBAYA4/CTF pin-cell simulation of VVER core subsets will be sub-
ject of separate publications.

For the purposes of this study a core boundary condition prob-
lem with pre-calculated boundary conditions was derived from the
OECD VVER MSLB benchmark. Validated COBAYA and DYN3D core-
physics models with homogenized nodes were coupled to full-core
FLICA4 or CTF thermal-hydraulic models. The core transient sce-
nario was analyzed in coupled COBAYA3/FLICA4, COBAYA4/CTF
and DYN3D/CTF simulations.

Special attention was paid to the effects of different ﬂow mixing
models in the RPV and the core. Time-dependent MSLB core
boundary conditions (BC) were obtained in two variants: from
CATHARE coarse-mesh RPV simulation (Spasov et al., 2010), and
from CFD calculations for the down-comer and the lower plenum
(Vyskocil, 2015). The corresponding vessel mixing models were
qualiﬁed against Kozloduy-6 data from a vessel mixing experiment
conducted during the plant commissioning phase (Topalov et al.,
2004; Kolev et al., 2007). The impact of CFD computed core
boundary conditions on the 3D core dynamics was explored in
comparative MSLB core calculations.

nodes was generated (Petrov et al., 2015) using the APOLLO2 code
(Sanchez, 2010; Santandrea et al., 2008). This library is supple-
mented by a multi-parameter library of APOLLO2 computed pin-
by-pin form functions for each node which allows DYN3D pin
power reconstruction.

In the sections below a brief description of the codes and mod-

els used is given and the simulation results are discussed.

2. Codes and models description

For coupled core neutronic-thermal hydraulic (N/TH) simula-
tion, recent versions of COBAYA, DYN3D, FLICA4 and CTF were
used. The considered code couplings are COBAYA3/FLICA4,
COBAYA4/CTF and DYN3D/CTF in Salome (http://www.salome-
platform.org/). CATHARE2 (Geffraye et al., 2011) and FLUENT
(ANSYS-Fluent, 2015) codes were used to solve the MSLB RPV
boundary condition problem and to compute time-dependent
MSLB core BC, as discussed in paragraphs 4.2 and 5.3 below.

These codes and couplings, except for FLUENT, make part of the
European NURESIM software platform (Chauliac et al., 2011 and
Chanaron et al., 2015) which is a set of state of the art software
devoted to the simulation of normal operation and design basis
accidents of light water reactors: BWR, PWR, VVER. This platform
currently includes 12 codes covering different physics: neutronics,
thermal-hydraulics, fuel thermo-mechanics and relevant scales:
local (sub-channel or pin), fuel assembly, core and reactor system.
Given their complementary features, the selected codes offer solu-
tions suitable for various situations.

2.1. COBAYA code

COBAYA is a multi-scale 3D core simulator code developed by
the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Cobaya team, 2015;
Ahnert, 2015). It uses transport-corrected multi-group (MG) diffu-
sion approximation and performs steady-state and transient calcu-
lations of light water reactors (LWR) for both Cartesian rectangular
and hexagonal geometries. At the nodal level, the ﬂux solver, called
ANDES (Analytic Nodal Diffusion Equation Solver) (Lozano et al.,
2008) uses the ACMFD (Analytic Coarse-Mesh Finite-Difference)
method (Aragones et al., 2007; Garcia-Herranz et al., 2002). ANDES
can be used stand-alone to perform nodal full-core calculations, or
as an accelerating module for the pin-by-pin solver. It has been
numerically validated for a number of numerical benchmarks
(Lozano et al., 2010). In hexagonal geometry, the code is capable
of node sub-division to 6 or 24 triangles per hexagon. In the pre-
sent study, 6 triangles per hexagon (6 N) and 30 axial nodes in
the heated core were assumed. At the pin level, the multi-group
diffusion equation is solved using a FMFD (ﬁne-mesh ﬁnite-
difference) method (Herrero et al., 2009).

The COBAYA nodal core physics solver has been extensively
benchmarked in the frame of EU projects. Recently a new version
of the code, COBAYA4 has been released (Ahnert, 2015) which fea-
tures a fully renovated code architecture and improved capability
of parallelization on multi-core systems and graphical processing
units (GPU). The code has been coupled with core thermal-
hydraulic codes in the Salome platform (see the paragraph on cou-
pling below).

2.2. DYN3D code

ver for hexagonal geometry and a multi-group SP3 pin-by-pin sol-
ver for square lattices have been added. The code has been coupled
with core TH codes in the Salome platform (see the paragraph on
coupling below). In this study at the nodal level the VVER model
assumes one node per hexagon and 30 axial nodes in the heated
part of the core.

DYN3D is capable of nodal calculations with pin power recon-
struction in hexagonal geometry (Hádek et al., 2009; Hádek,
2012; Gomez et al., 2014). In the frame of NURESAFE a recent ver-
sion of the nodal/PPR calculation scheme using an APOLLO2 gener-
ated multi-parameter library of pin-by-pin node power shapes
(form-functions) has been numerically validated vs. transport ref-
erence solutions for VVER mini-cores (Hádek, 2016).

2.3. Full-core FLICA4 model

FLICA4 (Toumi et al., 2000; Fillion et al., 2011a,b) is a 3D core
thermal-hydraulic code of CEA with sub-channel capabilities. It is
based on a fully 3D, four-equation mixture model with a correla-
tion for the interphase slip.

The FLICA4 full-core coarse-mesh VVER model used in the pre-
sent study and its validation are described in (Spasov and Kolev,
2013). The core model assumes one channel per fuel assembly
and 30 axial nodes in the heated core. The fuel heat conduction
model used 9 radial meshes in the fuel pellet, 1 for the gas gap
and 1 for the cladding, and ﬁtted nonlinear approximations of
the fuel thermal properties from the speciﬁcations.

2.4. Full-core CTF model

COBRA-TF thermal-hydraulic code with sub-channel capabili-
ties was originally developed by the Paciﬁc Northwest Laboratory
in 1980 and since then has been modiﬁed by several institutions.
COBRA-TF also found use at the Pennsylvania State University
(PSU) and subsequently at the North Carolina State University
(NCSU) where it has been improved, updated, and subsequently
re-branded as CTF (Avramova et al., 2006; Avramova, 2007;
Avramova and Cuervo, 2013). The CTF code uses a nine-equation
three-ﬁeld ﬂow model (Avramova, 2007). The user can opt
between 3D TH model and multi-channel with cross ﬂow.

The CTF coarse-mesh core model for VVER used in this simula-
tion is described in (Jimenez and Sanchez, 2013). The TH model
assumes one channel per fuel assembly and 30 axial nodes in the
heated core. The fuel heat conduction model used 9 radial meshes
in the fuel pellet, 1 for the gas gap and 1 in the cladding.

For the discussion and comparison of results, it is important to
mention the modeling options that are common with the FLICA4
model and those that are code-speciﬁc. The coarse-mesh spatial
discretization of the core is the same in both thermal-hydraulic
models. The fuel pin discretization in the heat conduction models
is also uniﬁed and the gas gap conductance coefﬁcient for burnt
fuel is assumed to be a given constant. The CTF model differs from
that of FLICA4 by the basic ﬂow equations, the ﬂow mixing model-
ing and the heat transfer models. For details see the references and
the discussion of results in the sequel. There is also a small differ-
ence in the approximations of the fuel thermal properties as a
function of temperature. In this simulation CTF used linear interpo-
lation in a table while the FLICA4 model used ﬁtted non-linear
functional approximations based on the same table.

2.5. Code couplings

DYN3D is a 3D core simulator developed by the Helmholtz-
Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. It solves the 2G diffusion equation
with a nodal expansion method and performs steady-state and
transient core calculations of LWR with hexagonal and square fuel
assemblies (Rohde et al., 2016). Recently a multi-group nodal sol-

The DYN3D/CTF coupling at the nodal level is based on previous
neutron kinetics – thermal-hydraulic coupling implementations
within the NURESIM platform (Jimenez et al., 2015). Both codes
have an Application Programing Interface (API) which was used

28

I. Spasov et al. / Nuclear Engineering and Design 321 (2017) 26–37

to access the different methods in a modular way. Each code
method is in charge of performing a speciﬁc task such as initializa-
tion, advancing a time step, checking for convergence or comput-
ing a steady state among others. In the practice, the API is used
inside python scripts which master the coupled execution in
steady state and transient mode. The data exchange between codes
takes proﬁt of the MED Coupling library provided in the Salome 6
platform. In this work, the coupling algorithm for steady states and
transients was veriﬁed to work properly also in hexagonal
geometries.

The COBAYA4/CTF coupling (García-Herranz et al., 2017) is
based on the use of each code API as described above and data
exchange through the MED Coupling library in Salome 6. The
Python script which governs the coupled calculation includes a
damping scheme (Merino et al., 1993) to smooth the power proﬁle
and accelerate the convergence to achieve initial steady state in the
performed transients. In this scheme the power at the current
time-step (n) is expressed as 0.4 * P(tn 1) + 0.6 * P(tn). A sensitivity
study was carried out to establish the optimum damping value for
this initial steady state. The geometrical coupling algorithm had to
be adapted for hexagonal geometries. At the pin-cell level, there is
a COBAYA4/CTF coupling in Salome 6 for a hexagonal assembly
(Cuervo et al., 2015). The results from this coupling (Kolev et al.,
2016) will be subject of a future publication.

The COBAYA3/FLICA4 coarse-mesh coupling (Jimenez, 2009) for
hexagonal geometries is based on the coupling functions in Salome
5 and supplemented by FLICA4 routines. Regarding the time
domain, an explicit marching scheme has been used between
COBAYA3-FLICA4 which limits the time steps to achieve acceptable
accuracy. The time step is set by the neutronics code and it needs
to be small enough to fulﬁll the Courant limit in the TH solution.

3. Cross-section libraries

For the simulation of reactivity accidents, a multi-parameter
cross-section library for transport-corrected diffusion calculations
with homogenized nodes was generated (Petrov et al., 2015) with
the APOLLO2 code (Sanchez, 2010; Santandrea et al., 2008). The
library is characterized by the following features:
 Two-level 281 g/42 g cross-section calculation scheme with the
Linear Surface Method of Characteristics (LS MOC) in APOLLO2
 JEFF3.1.1 nuclear data
 Table interpolation format
 Two energy groups
 Optimized parameter grid of 5 fuel Doppler temperature points
(470, 852.5, 1235, 1617.5, 2000 K), 3 moderator temperature
points (470, 545, 620 K) and 13 moderator density points (50,
76, 102, 128, 154, 207, 259, 311, 363, 467.5, 572, 676, 885 kg/
m3). The grid optimization (Sánchez Cervera et al., 2014)
ensures uncertainty of dk  120 pcm in case of linear interpola-
tion in cross-section tables
 Generated for a real reference core of Kozloduy-6 Cycle 8 with
once, twice and three times burnt fuel assemblies
 840 fuel compositions in 1/6 core (28 assemblies  30 axial
nodes) with given target exposure
 Uniform radial, top and bottom reﬂector compositions
 Explicit or implicit interface discontinuity factors for the fuel
nodes
 No transport corrections for the reﬂector nodes
 A supplementary library of APOLLO2 calculated full-core multi-
parameter pin-by-pin form-functions is provided (Petrov et al.,
2015), to be used for nodal calculations with pin power recon-
struction (PPR).

The cross-section library is available in two formats:
 Compact: with scattering cross-sections corrected for up-
scattering; with hexagon-averaged interface discontinuity fac-
tors (IDF) implicitly included in the cross-sections and node
speciﬁc composition-dependent kinetic parameters
 General multi-group format (for MG solvers): with full matrix of
scattering cross-sections, explicit side-dependent IDF and nodal
kinetic parameters dependent on the composition and TH
feedback.

The two library formats have been tested in steady-state and
transient nodal core simulations and shown to give results which
are close to each other (Sanchez-Cervera and Garcia-Herranz,
2015; Kolev et al., 2016). The differences in the results are more
pronounced in case of transients and steep ﬂux gradients, see Sec-
tion 5.2. The library of pin-by-pin form-functions for PPR has been
tested beyond the scope of this paper in NURESAFE nodal/PPR cal-
culations with DYN3D for VVER mini-cores (Hadek, 2015) vs.
transport reference solutions.

The cross-section library was validated in 2D COBAYA nodal dif-
fusion calculations vs. transport reference solutions at HZP (Ivanov,
2014) obtained with the TRIPOLI4 Ò Monte Carlo code (Trama,
2011; Brun et al., 2015) and in 3D steady-state core calculations
at hot power vs. plant data.

Fig. 1 shows a comparison of COBAYA/FLICA4 computed assem-
bly powers in steady state at 91% hot power vs. plant data recorded
by the Kozloduy-6 Core Monitoring System (CMS) for Cycle 8,
270.4 EFPD. The results show that the max absolute deviation in
the computed assembly powers is within the 5% CMS uncertainty
range. The computed k-eff is 0.99491 which differs from 1 by –
509 pcm. The main part of the deviations can be attributed to:
 Uncertainties in the given target burn-ups for each node (core
design code computed). The APOLLO2 predicted atomic number
densities for these target burn-ups inevitably differ from the
actual ones
 Radial reﬂector modeling with one average reﬂector node, with-
out transport corrections

4. Test problems

The MSLB test cases have been derived from the OECD VVER-
1000 MSLB benchmark (Kolev et al., 2006). The reference core is
Kozloduy-6 Cycle 8 at 270.4 EFPD. It contains once, twice and three
times burnt fuel assemblies and is surrounded by a row of radial
reﬂector assemblies and axial reﬂectors of the same width as the
fuel assembly pitch.

The MSLB transient is initiated at HFP by a large break of steam
line #4 upstream of the steam intercept valve, outside the contain-
ment. Following the break and the scram signal, two of the most
reactive peripheral control assemblies remain stuck out of the core,
close to the location of maximum overcooling. Two MSLB scenarios
have been speciﬁed. Scenario 1 is realistic, close to that used in the
current licensing practice but not the same. It has an additional
aggravating assumption of two stuck CR clusters instead of one.
Scenario 2 is pessimistic, derived from Scenario 1 by assuming that
the main coolant pump (MCP) of the faulted loop fails to trip on
MSLB signal and all MCP remain in operation during the transient.
The scram worth in Scenario 2 is assumed to be artiﬁcially reduced
to less than 50% of the real one by adjusting the absorption cross-
sections in UOX-CR assemblies and using this modiﬁed library.
This allows for a signiﬁcant return to power after scram in the
3D core N/TH calculations, which is a good test for the coupling
schemes. For transient simulation Scenario 2 is considered only.

The test problems include:
 MSLB steady-state calculations at HZP
 MSLB core boundary condition problem

For the discussion to follow, they are brieﬂy summarized below.

4.1. MSLB steady-state problems at HZP

HZP states are used to compare standalone code solutions. The
considered states, listed in Table 1 allow all standard tests of nodal
core physics codes in steady state. Detailed speciﬁcations are given
in (Kolev et al., 2014). In Table 1, Scenario 1 means that the steady
state calculation is to be performed with the realistic cross-section
library for UOX-CR assemblies. In Scenario 2 the modiﬁed library
with reduced absorption cross-sections for controlled assemblies
is to be used.

4.2. VVER MSLB core boundary condition problem

The MSLB core N/TH problem was derived from the OECD
VVER-1000 MSLB benchmark (Kolev et al., 2006) using pre-
calculated MSLB core boundary conditions and the corresponding
event sequence. The core thermal-hydraulic BC were computed
in two options: using a CATHARE2 24-sector multi-1D vessel
model with cross ﬂow (Spasov et al., 2010) or a CFD simulation
of the lower reactor vessel (Vyskocil, 2015). The validation of the
CATHARE input model and the mapping scheme used to convert
the coarse-mesh data to 163 assembly inlet data are reported in
(Spasov et al., 2010, 2013). The CATHARE2 computed MSLB core
BC are speciﬁed in a NURESAFE report (Kolev et al., 2014) and
shown here in Figs. 2–4. The CFD computed time-dependent core
inlet boundary conditions were obtained from a FLUENT calcula-
tion with realizable k-e turbulence model validated against the
Kozloduy-6 vessel mixing experiment. They were used in para-
graph 5.3 to compare core MSLB simulation with CFD vs. CATHARE
computed BC.

In the MSLB core boundary value problem the transient is initi-
ated through the pre-calculated core thermal hydraulic BC. Scram
is assumed to occur at 0.36 s of the MSLB transient. The time for
full insertion of the control rods is 4 s. Two peripheral control rods
remain stuck out of the core after scram. In order to analyze the
impact of vessel mixing models on the core transient, two different
locations of the stuck rods were simulated – one in fuel assemblies
#117 and #140, well within the overcooled sector, and another in
fuel assemblies #63 and #90 across the lateral boundary of the
overcooled core sector.

5. Results of the VVER MSLB simulation

cross-section library in MG format are closer to each other as com-
pared to those with the compact library. This is attributed to the
rigorous MG models and uniﬁed solution algorithms in both codes.
Table 4 shows the COBAYA4 24N solutions used to test the spa-
tial convergence. The comparison of DYN3D and COBAYA4 6N solu-
tions vs. 24N solutions shows that both ﬂux solvers produce
solutions which are well converged in space. The results are consis-
tent with those reported in (Kolev et al., 2011) for earlier code
versions.

Figs. 5–8 show the DYN3D vs. COBAYA4 computed core axial
and radial power distributions in State 1a, respectively State 3
using the compact cross-section library. In Fig. 6 coloured assem-
blies mark the location of the inserted control rods. In Fig. 8 the
location of the stuck rod (#90) and the inserted rods in State 3
are marked in colour. The code-to-code comparison shows gener-
ally good agreement, with a small radial tilt of systematic nature
and somewhat larger differences in the assembly powers in regions
of steep ﬂux gradients. The max relative difference in the assembly
powers is 2.7%, in State 3 at the location of the stuck rod. The tilt
and the discrepancies in local power are attributed mainly to the
model differences and node sub-division in COBAYA4 (see also
Table 4).

5.2. MSLB core transient results

The location of the stuck rods was assumed to be in the periph-
eral assemblies #117 and #140, well within the overcooled core
sector. Coupled code results obtained with COBAYA3/FLICA4,
COBAYA4/CTF and DYN3D/CTF were compared code-to-code. For
a meaningful comparison of the results, some modeling assump-
tions such as the spatial discretization in the neutron kinetics, ther-
mal hydraulics and the fuel heat conduction model, as well as the
local loss coefﬁcients in vertical direction were uniﬁed to the
extent possible. In the core TH models there are differences in
the basic ﬂow equations, the ﬂow mixing and heat transfer models,
and the approximations of the fuel thermal properties (linear inter-
polation in tables in the CTF model vs. non-linear ﬁtted approxima-
tions used in the FLICA4 model) which can cause certain
differences. The diversity of simulation results allows for the sepa-

In order to study the impact of vessel mixing modeling on the
MSLB core dynamics, separate core simulations with CATHARE
and CFD computed MSLB core BC have been performed. This sec-
tion presents the results obtained with core BC from a CATHARE2
24-sector RPV calculation. Core simulation results with CFD com-
puted MSLB core BC will be discussed in Section 5.3. Note that
all results throughout this paper are obtained using the compact
cross-section library, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Fig. 9 shows the predicted time history of total core power. A
signiﬁcant return to power can be seen, with a maximum of 66–

imum return to power as computed by the considered codes.

properties: CTF uses linear interpolation in tables while FLICA4
employs nonlinear ﬁtted approximations based on the same tables.
Fig. 10 illustrates a comparison of the radial core power distri-
butions at time of max return to power (69 s) as computed by
COBAYA4/CTF using the cross-section library in compact vs. gen-
eral MG format (see the discussion of the impact of this reﬁnement
at the end of paragraph 5.2).

The hot assembly parameters at time of max overcooling (69 s
of the transient) are shown in Figs. 11–13, as computed at the
nodal level. The results show that despite the high amount of
energy release in the hot assembly, no bulk boiling occurs except
for a little sub-cooled boiling at the walls predicted by FLICA4. This
is mainly due to the deep overcooling and low inlet temperature.
The values of the hot assembly safety parameters, such as fuel cen-
ter temperature and cladding temperature remain within the
acceptable limits for burnt fuel.

Fig. 9. Time history of the total core power with stuck rods in #117 and #140.

2 denotes solutions with the general MG format library. DYN3D/
CTF and COBAYA3/FLICA4 predict a slight return to criticality of a
few pcm while the core reactivity in the COBAYA4/CTF solution
is close to criticality but remains slightly negative. The behavior
of the core is determined by the dynamics of a small number of
assemblies in the overcooled sector around the stuck rod locations,
and the core power is released mainly in these assemblies. Hot
assembly is #129,
located between the assemblies #117 and
#140 with the stuck rods.

The results in Fig. 9 and Table 5 show a good overall agreement.
The COBAYA4/CTF and DYN3D/CTF computed total power curves
are nearly parallel with a shift which indicates somewhat different
tripped rod worth. This difference is attributed mainly to the neu-
tron kinetics models. On the other hand, the comparison of
COBAYA3/FLICA4 vs. COBAYA4/CTF results shows the impact of
fuel heat conduction and core mixing modeling. It should be noted
that the core physics models in COBAYA3 and COBAYA4 are essen-
tially the same. Fig. 9 shows that the results with these couplings
are close to each other until app. 130 s of the transient, and after
that some decline of the COBAYA3/FLICA4 solution from that of
COBAYA4/CTF can be seen. The analysis, involving simulation with
an independent coupling of COBAYA3 shows that this is mainly
due to the use of different approximations of the fuel thermal

per hexagon (6N, 24N) in COBAYA were compared using the same
convergence criteria. In the 24N solution the maximum return to
power is lower by 29 MW (which is app. 1% of the nominal rated
power) and the hexagonal node peaking factors are only slightly
different. The COBAYA 6N transient solution is well converged in
space.

The coupled COBAYA/CTF core model has the potential for fur-
ther improvements through the use of simultaneous COBAYA 6N
and thermal-hydraulic node sub-division to 6 channels (6C) per
hexagon. This requires some veriﬁcation runs using the corre-
sponding functions in the CTF code API for hexagonal/triangular
geometry. A preliminary test of the TH mesh sub-division was car-
ried out in MSLB simulation (Kolev et al., 2016) with an indepen-
dent coupling of COBAYA3-6N/COBRA3c-6C. The effect was app.
1% higher maximum total power and 1.8% lower Fxy peaking factor
due to the reﬁned mesh of the feedback action.

Numerical experiments (not illustrated here) show that a
reﬁnement of the radial CTF fuel model mesh from 7 to 10 equidis-
tant radial points in the pellet gives 1 MW higher total power and
practically the same volumetric peaking factor. The heat conduc-
tion solution is well converged in space.

The impact of different core mixing models in CTF was studied
in comparative calculations with given turbulent mixing coefﬁ-
cient Beta = Transfer mass ﬂux/Axial mass ﬂux = 0.001 vs. single-
phase mixing
Rogers-Rosehart
(Avramova, 2007). The results at time of maximal return to power
(69 s) are practically the same: Ptot = 2047.13 MW, Fq = 4.265
when
while
Ptot = 2046.86 MW, Fq = 4.263 with mixing coefﬁcient equal to
0.001. The Rogers-Rosehart model was adopted as basic in this
study.

Comparative simulations with COBAYA4/CTF using the compact
vs. the general MG format cross-section library show that in the
considered MSLB transient the effect of using the full matrix of
scattering cross sections and explicit IDF, as well as thermo-
hydraulic feedback-dependent kinetic parameters is relatively
small but not negligible (see Fig. 10 and Tables 5, 6). The max total
power at 69 s is 2098 MW (gen. format lib) vs. 2047 MW (compact
lib), while the volumetric peaking factor is lower by app. 1% due to
the different 3D ﬂux redistribution.

DYN3D nodal/PPR calculations have been tested for mini-cores
in the NURESAFE project beyond the scope of this article (Hádek,
2016; Kolev et al., 2016). The full-core nodal cross-section library
for MSLB analysis (Petrov et al., 2015) has a provision for PPR with
a supplementary library of APOLLO2 computed pin-by-pin nodal
power shapes (form-functions). The full-core nodal model of
DYN3D is ready to use with PPR for the hot assembly (available
model, cross-section library and full-core multi-parameter pin-
by-pin form function library for PPR).

It is worth noting that a sub-channel CTF thermal-hydraulic
model of a VVER assembly was developed in the frame of NURE-
SAFE (Spasov et al., 2014) and tested on a hot assembly TH bound-
ary condition problem in comparison with a FLICA4 sub-channel
model. The results of this analysis (Kolev et al., 2016) will be pre-
sented in a future publication.

In order to assess the spatial convergence of the nodal solutions
and the effects of model reﬁnements, numerical experiments were
carried out as summarized below.

Table 7 illustrates the impact of the neutronic mesh reﬁnement.
Transient solutions with node sub-division to 6 and 24 triangles

For improved resolution of the MSLB core-vessel simulation, the
use of CFD computed core BC was explored. The objective was to
analyze the advantages and limitations of such reﬁnements for
the simulation of reactivity transients with sector formation. A
computationally efﬁcient FLUENT model of the down-comer and
the lower plenum with realizable k-e (rke) turbulence model was
created and tested (Vyskocˇil, 2013) against the Kozloduy-6 vessel
mixing experiment (Kolev et al., 2007). Time-dependent MSLB core
boundary conditions were calculated with this model by solving
the MSLB RPV boundary condition problem of the OECD VVER-
1000 MSLB benchmark (Kolev et al., 2006). In this calculation an
unstructured spatial mesh of 1.5 million cells and second-order
upwind advection scheme were used.

shot maps of the assembly inlet coolant temperatures at 70 s from
the onset of the MSLB transient. This is near the time of max over-
cooling (69 s). Figs. 15–17 show that in this particular comparison
the CFD (Vyskocil, 2015) and CATHARE 24-sector (Spasov et al.,
2010) computed BCs are close to each other in the interior of the
disturbed sector and may be substantially different around the lat-
eral boundary of the disturbed sector, because of differences in the
predicted loop ﬂow rotation and mixing. We explore the impact of
the use of CFD computed BCs on the local and global core dynamics
when the stuck rod perturbations are imposed well within the dis-
turbed sector, and at the lateral sector boundaries.

core BC vs. CATHARE2 core BC.

The results with the stuck rods in the interior of this sector
(#117, #140) show that the corresponding total core powers and
peaking factors are close to each other, see Table 8. The effect of
using CFD computed core BC is small and mainly at the periphery
of the disturbed sector. The maximum total power is lower by
19 MW due to the CFD predicted stronger mixing at the lateral sec-
tor boundaries.

However, this may not be the case when the stuck rods are
located around the lateral boundary of the disturbed sector. In
order to explore this possibility, the location of the two stuck rods
was assumed to be in fuel assemblies #63 and #90 at the lateral
boundary of the overcooled core sector (see Fig. 19). These control
rods are from the same rod groups and at the same radial positions
as in the preceding case. Figs. 16 and 17 show that in this case the
FLUENT rke and CATHARE computed time-dependent inlet BC for
assembly #63 are different because of the higher CFD resolution
around the lateral boundaries of the disturbed sector. In this case
the impact of the CFD computed BC on the core dynamics is a little
more pronounced in terms of local parameters. See Fig. 18 for the
corresponding differences in the total core power, and Fig. 19 for
the radial power distributions at 70 s (app. the time of maximum
return to power). The total power and the peaking factors are sum-
marized in Table 9. FLUENT rke predicts more coolant mixing
around the stuck rods and the maximum return to power with
CFD BC is lower by 40 MW. The peaking factors obtained with
CATHARE computed BC are only slightly different (see Table 9)
since the hot assembly #104 is located well within the overcooled
sector.

The results show that the main differences in the CFD vs. CATH-
ARE computed assembly inlet temperatures (and correspondingly
in the local assembly powers) are around the lateral boundaries
of the disturbed sector due to the higher CFD resolution. This
suggests that the CFD computed core BC may be important in the
analysis of hypothetical scenarios of asymmetric VVER coolant
transients with multiple rod perturbations of the core.

In conclusion, we have presented a sample comparison of MSLB
results using core BC computed with two particular models: CATH-

solutions in the OECD VVER-1000 vessel mixing benchmark report
(Kolev et al., 2010) and in related publications such as (Bieder et al.,
2007; Hoehne, 2009) (Böttcher and Krüßmann, 2010) one can
expect some scatter in the parameters of the core transient when
using transient core boundary conditions obtained with different
computationally efﬁcient CFD models. Additional testing is neces-
sary for accuracy-cost optimization.

References

Recent developments in the NURESIM platform nodal calcula-
tion schemes for core analysis were implemented and tested in
VVER MSLB core simulation.

The testing of the core physics models shows that the neutron
ﬂux solutions are well converged in space. Node subdivision to
24 triangles per hexagon in COBAYA4 does not substantially
improve the results.

for

The DYN3D code is capable of nodal/PPR calculations for VVER
RIA analysis, which have been tested for mini-cores in the NURE-
SAFE project beyond the scope of this paper. It is ready to use for
VVER mini-cores and full-core simulation with PPR for the hot
assembly.

for

further

improvement

The coupled COBAYA4/CTF models for VVER applications have
the potential
through the use of
thermal-hydraulic node sub-division to six triangles per hexagon.
This requires the activation and veriﬁcation of the corresponding
functions in the CTF code API for hexagonal/triangular geometry.
The results with coarse-mesh and CFD computed core boundary
conditions show that the validated system code models of the RPV
are applicable to MSLB analysis but have some limitations in reso-
lution for the local effects.

Validated CFD calculations of the down-comer and the lower
plenum conditions are found to improve the resolution in the 3D
core simulation of asymmetric coolant transients with sector for-
mation. In the considered cases the impact of this reﬁnement is
mild and is more pronounced around the periphery of the dis-
turbed sector. It may be stronger in hypothetic scenarios of asym-
metric VVER coolant transients with multiple rod perturbations of
the core.

We have presented a sample comparison of MSLB results mak-
ing use of transient core boundary conditions computed with two
particular models: CATHARE 24-sector coarse-mesh and FLUENT
with a limited number of cells and rke turbulence model. Based
on the lessons from the OECD VVER-1000 vessel mixing bench-
mark and the studies in related publications one can expect some
scatter in the parameters of the core transient when using different
computationally efﬁcient CFD models. Additional testing is neces-
sary for accuracy-cost optimization.
