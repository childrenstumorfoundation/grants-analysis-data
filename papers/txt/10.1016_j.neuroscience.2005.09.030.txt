Abstract—Neuroﬁbromatosis type I is a common autosomal
dominant disease characterized by formation of multiple be-
nign and malignant tumors. People with this disorder also
experience chronic pain, which can be disabling. Neuroﬁbrin-
omin, the protein product of the NF1 gene (neuroﬁbromin
gene (human)), is a guanosine triphosphate activating pro-
tein for p21ras. Loss of NF1 results in an increase in activity of
the p21ras transduction cascade. Because of the growing
evidence suggesting involvement of downstream compo-
nents of the p21ras transduction cascade in the sensitization
of nociceptive sensory neurons, we examined the stimulus-
evoked release of the neuropeptides, substance P and calci-
tonin gene-related peptide, from primary sensory neurons of
mice with a mutation of the Nf1 gene (neuroﬁbromin gene
(mouse)) (Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ). Measuring immunoreactive substance P
and immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide by radio-
immunoassay, we demonstrated that capsaicin-stimulated
release of neuropeptides is three to ﬁve-fold higher in spinal
cord slices from Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ mice than from wildtype mouse
tissue. In addition, the potassium and capsaicin-stimulated
release of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide
from cultures of sensory neurons isolated from Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ mice
was more than double that from cultures of wildtype neurons.
Treatment of wildtype sensory neurons with nerve growth
factor for 5–7 days mimicked the enhanced stimulus-evoked
release observed from the Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ neurons. When nerve
growth factor was removed 48 h before conducting release

experiments, nerve growth factor-induced augmentation of
immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide release from
Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ neurons was more pronounced than in Nf1ⴙ/ⴚ sen-
sory neurons that were treated with nerve growth factor con-
tinuously for 5–7 days. Thus, sensory neurons from mice
with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene that is analo-
gous to the human disease neuroﬁbromatosis type I, exhibit
increased sensitivity to chemical stimulation. This aug-
mented responsiveness may explain the abnormal pain sen-
sations experienced by people with neuroﬁbromatosis type I
and suggests an important role for guanosine triphosphate
activating proteins, in the regulation of nociceptive sensory
neuron sensitization. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most com-
mon genetic diseases in humans, with an incidence of one
in 3500 people (Lakkis and Tennekoon, 2000). It is a
pandemic, autosomal dominant disease and the hallmark
of NF1 is the formation of various benign and malignant
tumors. However, other common problems experienced by
people with NF1 include abnormal painful sensations and
painful
itching or pruritus (Riccardi and Eichner, 1992;
Creange et al., 1999; Wolkenstein et al., 2001). Although
the mechanisms by which the human neuroﬁbromin gene
(NF1) mutation causes these debilitating symptoms have
not been elucidated, it is likely that these abnormal pain
states involve altered function of small diameter nocicep-
tive sensory neurons that mediate the transmission of pain
and itch (Besson and Chaouch, 1987; Schmelz et al.,
1997). Numerous studies have examined the ability of
nociceptive neurons to undergo sensitization to thermal,
mechanical or chemical stimuli, resulting in states of hy-
peralgesia and allodynia (Treede et al., 1992). These be-
havioral changes correlate with increased excitability as
measured by electrophysiological methods and by the en-
hanced release of the peptide transmitters, substance P
(SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These
neuropeptides are localized in small diameter A-delta and
C sensory neurons (Willis and Coggeshall, 1991) and are
released from both peripheral and central terminals by
noxious stimulation (Kuraishi et al., 1985; Linderoth and
Brodin, 1988; Hua and Yaksh, 1992). Therefore, one
mechanism for an increase in pain signaling observed in
people with NF1 could be an enhanced release of SP and
CGRP from primary sensory neurons.

The mutation in NF1 causes decreased production of
functional neuroﬁbromin, the protein product of the NF1
gene. Neuroﬁbromin is a guanosine triphosphatase acti-
vating protein (GAP) for p21ras (Ras; Martin et al., 1990;
Wallace et al., 1990; Li et al., 1992). The Ras transduction
pathway is activated by many cytokines and growth fac-
tors, as indicated by an increase in Ras-guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP) levels, and this transduction cascade is im-
portant for cell survival, growth and proliferation in many
cells types (Bar-Sagi and Hall, 2000; Kolch, 2000). Active
Ras-GTP recruits the kinase, Raf, to the membrane and
thereby activates a cascade of downstream effectors such
as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a member
of the mitogen activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K; Wennstrom and
Downward, 1999). Ras-GTP is converted to the inactive
form, Ras-guanosine diphosphate, through hydrolysis and
this reaction is accelerated thousands of fold by neuroﬁ-
bromin, thereby limiting the strength and duration of down-
stream signals. Loss of NF1 frequently results in an in-
crease in both basal and cytokine-stimulated Ras activity
(Bollag and McCormick, 1991; Largaespada et al., 1996;
Zhang et al., 1998; Cichowski and Jacks, 2001).

To elucidate the pathologic mechanisms in NF1,
mouse models were developed in which the mouse neu-
roﬁbromin gene (Nf1) was disrupted (Jacks et al., 1994;
Largaespada et al., 1996). Although mice with a homozy-
gous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1⫺/⫺ mice) die in utero,
mice with a heterozygous mutation (Nf1⫹/⫺ mice), that is
analogous to the human autosomal dominant disorder,
have a normal
lifespan. Neurons, mast cells, ﬁbroblasts
and Schwann cells from Nf1⫹/⫺ mice exhibit some of the
abnormal characteristics observed in similar cells isolated
from human neuroﬁbromas. Sensory neurons from embry-
onic Nf1⫹/⫺ and Nf1⫺/⫺ mice do not require nerve
growth factor (NGF) for survival, unlike wild-type sensory
neurons (Vogel et al., 1995). Sensory neurons with the Nf1
mutation also exhibit increased amounts of Ras-GTP and
activation of the PI-3K pathway (Vogel et al., 1995; Klesse
and Parada, 1998).

There is growing evidence that NGF and other growth
factors can activate downstream effectors of the Ras trans-
duction cascade to affect changes in adult sensory neu-
rons. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve or injection
of capsaicin into the paw results in an increase in phos-
phorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (pERK) in
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells (Dai et al., 2002), as does
peripheral inﬂammation (Obata et al., 2003). NGF-induced
increases in pERK and phosphorylated protein kinase B
(pAkt, a downstream effector of the PI-3K pathway) are
associated with increases in the expression of the heat-
and capsaicin-activated receptor, TRPV1, in DRG neurons
(Bron et al., 2003). The inhibitor of mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase kinase (Mek), PD98059, reduces the capsaicin
sensitivity of neurons treated with NGF (Ganju et al., 1998)
and Zhuang and coworkers (2004) demonstrate that both
Mek and PI-3K activity are important in NGF-mediated
changes in capsaicin currents and thermal hyperalgesia.
This suggests that many of the NGF-mediated changes in

capsaicin sensitivity in primary sensory neurons involve
Ras-activated pathways.

Because of the evidence that downstream effectors of
the Ras transduction cascade are involved in enhanced
sensitivity of sensory neurons, or peripheral sensitization,
it is important to examine regulation of this cascade. The
GAP, neuroﬁbromin, is a key regulator of Ras-GTP levels
and, therefore, we investigated whether the reduction in
neuroﬁbromin in Nf1⫹/⫺ mice, could augment the sensitiv-
ity of primary sensory neurons. We measured stimulus-
evoked neuropeptide release from both spinal cord slices
and isolated sensory neurons from wildtype (Nf1⫹/⫹) and
Nf1⫹/⫺ mice as an indicator of sensory neuron sensitivity.
Our data demonstrate an enhanced stimulus-evoked re-
lease of neuropeptide transmitters from Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory
neurons. This is the ﬁrst demonstration of an alteration in
the sensitivity of adult sensory neurons in response to
changes in GAP expression. It is clear, therefore, that
neuroﬁbromin can modulate sensory neuron responsive-
ness and play an important role in peripheral sensitization.
These mechanisms may account for the dysesthesias,
pain and pruritus experienced by patients with NF1.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Mice heterozygous for the Nf1 mutation on a background of
C57BL/6J were originally developed by Dr. Tyler Jacks (Jacks et
al., 1994). All animals were housed and bred in the Indiana
University Laboratory Animal Research Center and used in accor-
dance with National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23) revised 1996. All
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Indiana University
School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
These procedures involve measures to minimize the number of
animals used and the suffering of animals.

Horse serum, F-12 medium, L-glutamine, and penicillin/strep-
tomycin were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
NGF was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.
(Indianapolis, IN, USA). Collagenase, poly-D-lysine, laminin, 5=-
ﬂuoro-2=-deoxyuridine, uridine and standard laboratory chemicals
were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies to substance P
and calcitonin gene-related peptide were generously provided by
Michael R. Vasko (Indiana University School of Medicine, India-
napolis, IN, USA).

To establish sensory neuron cultures, the DRG were removed
from adult mice in a manner similar to that previously published
(Southall and Vasko, 2000; Burkey et al., 2004). DRG were dis-
sociated by mechanical agitation after digestion in 0.1% collage-
nase for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were plated in wells of 24-well
Falcon culture dishes coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin at a
density of 40,000 –50,000 cells/well. Cultures were maintained at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in F12 media supplemented with
2 mM glutamine, 50 ␮g/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 10% heat-
inactivated horse serum and mitotic inhibitors (50 ␮M 5-ﬂuoro-2-
deoxyuridine and 150 ␮M uridine). Growth medium was changed
every 2–3 days.

The stimulus-evoked release and content of SP and CGRP
was measured from spinal cord slices as previously published
(Southall et al., 1998) using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and is re-
ported as immunoreactive peptide (immunoreactive substance P,
iSP; or immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide, iCGRP).
The minimal amount of iSP and iCGRP detected by the respective
RIAs is 5 fmol with a 95% conﬁdence interval (Chen et al., 1996).
The entire spinal cord from each animal was removed, weighed
and chopped parasagitally and transversely into 300 ␮m cross-

639

sections using a McIllwain Tissue Chopper. The average amount
of protein per spinal cord was 92 ␮g (standard deviation of 28 ␮g
for 20 animals). There was no signiﬁcant difference in spinal cord
weight between the genotypes. The sections from each spinal
cord were placed into individual chambers and perfused at a
rate of 0.5 ml/min for 15 min with Krebs buffer consisting of (in
mM): 135 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaHCO3,
2.5 mM CaCl2, 3.3 mM dextrose, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albu-
min, 100 ␮M Phe-Ala, and 50 ␮M p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic
acid (PCMS), pH 7.4, aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2. The com-
pounds, Phe-Ala and PCMS are used as peptidase inhibitors
(Chen et al., 1996). After the equilibration period, serial 3 min
collections (1.5 ml of perfusate) were obtained from each spinal
cord. After three basal collection periods (total of 9 min), the
perfusate was changed to Krebs buffer containing 250 nM cap-
saicin for 9 min to measure stimulus-evoked release. Upon com-
pletion of the stimulus, a 15 min perfusion with Krebs buffer alone
was performed to allow a return to resting conditions. An aliquot
from each 3 min collection period was assayed for iSP and iCGRP
using RIA. After the release protocol was complete, the peptide
content of the tissue was determined by homogenizing the resid-
ual spinal cord tissue in 0.1 N HCl. The homogenized tissue was
centrifuged and the supernatant was serially diluted with Krebs
buffer. Peptide content was determined from these diluted sam-
ples by RIA. This value was added to the amount of iSP or iCGRP
released during the perfusion to obtain the total peptide content.
The release of iSP or iCGRP is expressed as percent of the total
neuropeptide content per min of perfusion.

The stimulus-evoked release and content of iCGRP were
measured from cells in culture as previously published (Hingtgen
and Vasko, 1994) using RIA. Because basal levels of iSP release
were below the level of detection in cultures of sensory neurons
grown in the absence of NGF, iSP release was not measured in
these experiments. Sensory neurons were maintained in culture
for 5–7 days prior to the release experiments. Medium was re-
moved and the cells were washed with HEPES buffer consisting of
(in mM): 25 HEPES, 135 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 Mg2Cl2, 3.3
dextrose, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and
maintained at 37 °C. Cells initially were incubated in HEPES buffer

for 10 min to determine resting or basal release levels iCGRP. The
cells underwent subsequent 10 min incubations in HEPES buffer
containing stimulants (50 mM KCl or 50 nM capsaicin) or HEPES
buffer alone. Aliquots of the incubation samples were assayed for
iCGRP using RIA. Peptide content of the sensory neurons in
culture was determined by exposing the wells of cells to 2 N acetic
acid for 10 min. Aliquots of the acid solution were diluted in
HEPES buffer and assayed for iCGRP using RIA. This value was
added to the amount of iCGRP released in the previous 10 min
periods to obtain the total iCGRP content per well of cells. Each
manipulation was repeated in cells from at least three different
preparations.

Results are expressed as the mean⫾standard error of the
mean (S.E.M.). Differences in neuropeptide release and content
were determined by t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
post hoc analysis, as appropriate. The signiﬁcance level for all
statistical tests was P⬍0.05.

RESULTS

Neuropeptide release from spinal cord slice
preparations
Mice with disruption of the Nf1 gene (Nf1⫹/⫺) that en-
codes for the GAP, neuroﬁbromin, were developed to
study the human disorder, NF1. Sensory neurons with the
Nf1 mutation also exhibit increased amounts of Ras and
activation of the PI-3-K pathway (Vogel et al., 1995; Klesse
and Parada, 1998). Since these cascades have been im-
plicated in sensory neuron activation, one might hypothe-
size that sensory neurons from Nf1⫹/⫺ mice have en-
hanced sensitivity to a given stimulus. Therefore, to deter-
mine if a reduction in neuroﬁbromin results in sensitization
of nociceptive sensory neurons, the capsaicin-stimulated
release of the neuropeptide transmitters, iSP and iCGRP,
was measured from spinal cord slice preparations ob-
tained from wildtype and Nf1⫹/⫺ mice. As seen in Fig. 1,

Fig. 1. Capsaicin-stimulated release of iSP and iCGRP is greater from Nf1⫹/⫺ spinal cord preparations than from wildtype tissue. Adult mouse spinal
cord slices were perfused with Krebs buffer for 9 min (Basal, B), Krebs buffer containing 250 nM capsaicin (C) for 9 min and then Krebs buffer alone
again for 15 min (B). The prefusate was assayed for iSP (represented in panel A) and iCGRP (represented in panel B) using RIA. The columns
represent the mean release of peptide expressed as % peptide content/min of perfusion⫾S.E.M. for nine animals per genotype. An asterisk indicates
a statistically signiﬁcant difference between resting and capsaicin-stimulated release of peptide whereas # indicates a statistically signiﬁcant difference
between genotypes using a t-test (P⬍0.05).

there was no signiﬁcant difference in basal release of iSP
or
iCGRP between spinal cord slices obtained from
Nf1⫹/⫹ and Nf1⫹/⫺ mice. The basal release of iSP and
iCGRP from wildtype mouse spinal cord slices was
0.18⫾0.04 and 0.19⫾0.07% total peptide content/min, re-
spectively, whereas the basal release of iSP and iCGRP
from Nf1⫹/⫺ mouse spinal cord slices was 0.11⫾0.02 and
0.21⫾0.02% total peptide content/min, respectively.
In
contrast, there is a signiﬁcant increase in the capsaicin-
stimulated release of iSP and iCGRP from Nf1⫹/⫺ mouse
spinal cord slices compared with those from wildtype ani-
mals. The release of iSP evoked by 250 nM capsaicin was
two-fold higher from Nf1⫹/⫺ mouse spinal cord slices than
from those from wildtype mice (0.28⫾0.05 versus
0.54⫾0.1% total peptide content/min for wildtype and
Nf1⫹/⫺ mice,
the capsaicin-
evoked release of iCGRP from the same preparations was

respectively). Similarly,

almost four-fold higher from Nf1⫹/⫺ mouse spinal cord
slices (1.1⫾0.2 versus 3.8⫾0.9% total peptide content/min
for wildtype and Nf1⫹/⫺ mice, respectively). After capsa-
icin was removed from the perfusion buffer, neuropeptide
release returned to basal levels. In the spinal cord prepa-
ration, the total content of iSP and iCGRP was not signif-
icantly different between the genotypes; the content of iSP
was 2700⫾120 and 2900⫾150 fmol/spinal cord for
Nf1⫹/⫹ and Nf1⫹/⫺ mice, respectively (mean⫾S.E.M.,
n⫽9 animals). These data clearly demonstrate that capsa-
icin-stimulated release of iSP and iCGRP is enhanced in
spinal cord tissue from Nf1⫹/⫺ mice.

Neuropeptide release from isolated sensory neurons

To demonstrate that the enhanced release of neuropep-
tides from Nf1⫹/⫺ spinal cord slice preparations was a

sensory neurons were maintained in culture for 5–7 days. Panel A depicts iCGRP release from cells treated with successive 10 min incubations of
normal HEPES buffer (basal, B), HEPES buffer containing 50 mM KCl (HK), and HEPES buffer alone, again. Panel B depicts iCGRP release from

content between genotypes using a t-test.

direct result of increased responsiveness of the primary
sensory neuron terminals and not related to other cells in
the spinal cord, the stimulus-evoked release of iCGRP was
measured in isolated mouse sensory neurons from
Nf1⫹/⫹ and Nf1⫹/⫺ mice. For these experiments, the
sensory neurons were maintained in culture for 5–7 days
prior to conducting the release experiments. As shown in
Fig. 2a, the initial basal or resting release of iCGRP was
not signiﬁcantly different between genotypes (6.7⫾1.2 and
10⫾2.0 fmol/well for wildtype and Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neu-
rons, respectively, n⫽6 –15 wells). In contrast, potassium-
stimulated iCGRP release was almost two-fold higher from
the Nf1⫹/⫺ cells compared with Nf1⫹/⫹ cells; 30⫾2.6
versus 16⫾1.3 fmol/well, respectively (n⫽8 –20 wells for
each genotype, P value for t-test ⬍0.05). Similarly, in a
separate series of studies, the release of iCGRP in re-
sponse to 50 nM capsaicin was almost three-fold higher
from Nf1⫹/⫺ cells compared with wildtype cells (Fig. 2b).
The initial basal release of iCGRP was 7.0⫾0.44 fmol/well
from Nf1⫹/⫹ cells and increased to 14⫾1 fmol/well with a
10 min exposure to capsaicin. Although basal release of
iCGRP was not different in Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neuron prep-
arations (9.6⫾1.1 fmol/well), capsaicin-stimulated release
was signiﬁcantly higher from Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons
(48⫾5 fmol/well, n⫽6 –15 wells for each genotype, P value
for t-test ⬍0.05). In all instances, iCGRP release returned
to resting levels when the cells were incubated in HEPES
buffer alone following the stimulation period. The increase
in stimulus-evoked release of iCGRP from Nf1⫹/⫺ neu-
rons was not a result of an increased content of iCGRP as
there was no signiﬁcant difference in neuropeptide content

between genotypes in these preparations (Fig. 2c, 680⫾81
fmol/well for Nf1⫹/⫹ preparations versus 740⫾65 fmol/
well for Nf1⫹/⫺ preparations, n⫽28 –30 wells). As ob-
served in the spinal cord slice preparations, there was an
enhanced stimulus-evoked release of iCGRP from isolated
sensory neurons with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1
gene compared with wildtype neurons, conﬁrming that
sensitization of sensory neurons occurs secondary to the
genetic trait.

Neuropeptide release from isolated sensory neurons
treated with NGF

The neurotrophin, NGF can activate TrkA receptors on
sensory neurons and thereby activate the Ras transduc-
tion cascade (Kaplan et al., 1991; Sofroniew et al., 2001).
Recently, studies have focused on the ability of down-
stream components of this cascade to alter sensory neu-
ron signaling. To determine if sensory neurons from
Nf1⫹/⫺ mice have an altered response to NGF because of
a decrease in neuroﬁbromin production, isolated sensory
neurons from Nf1⫹/⫺ and wildtype mice were maintained
in culture in the absence or presence of various concen-
trations of NGF. In preparations from both genotypes, the
total content of iCGRP was enhanced by growth in increas-
ing concentrations of NGF, although there was no differ-
ence in the content of iCGRP between the genotypes
treated with the same concentration of NGF (data not
shown). Because exposure to NGF increased the content
of iCGRP in the isolated neuronal preparation, the release
data in this series of experiments are expressed as percent

Fig. 3. The effect of continuous treatment of isolated sensory neurons with NGF on stimulus-evoked release of iCGRP. Adult mouse sensory neurons
receiving NGF treatment were grown in the absence or presence of NGF for 5–7 days. Release stimulated by a 10 min exposure to HEPES buffer
containing 50 mM KCl (K) or release stimulated by HEPES buffer containing 50 nM capsaicin (C) is expressed as the percent of total iCGRP content
per well of cells. The columns represent the mean⫾S.E.M. peptide release as a percent of total iCGRP content from neurons from at least three
separate preparations (n⫽6 –22 wells per condition) with the open columns representing release from wildtype neurons and hatched columns
representing release from Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons. Asterisks (*) indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences between genotypes receiving the same treatment
using a t-test (P⬍0.05). The # symbol indicates a signiﬁcant difference in iCGRP release from wildtype neurons with NGF treatment compared with
release from wildtype neurons that did not receive NGF treatment (ANOVA with Dunnet’s post hoc analysis, P⬍0.05). @ Indicates a signiﬁcant
difference in iCGRP release from Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons with NGF treatment compared with release from Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons that did not receive NGF
treatment (ANOVA with Dunnet’s post hoc analysis, P⬍0.05).

of total content. Treatment with NGF did not cause a
signiﬁcant difference in basal or resting release expressed
as either absolute amounts or as a percent of total iCGRP
content (data not shown).

When cells were maintained in NGF for the entire 5–7
days, both the potassium and capsaicin-stimulated release
of iCGRP were signiﬁcantly enhanced in wildtype sensory
neurons. As seen in Fig. 3, potassium-evoked release from
wildtype sensory neurons maintained in either 30 or
250 ng/ml NGF was signiﬁcantly higher than from neu-
rons that were not exposed to NGF, whereas capsaicin-
stimulated release was signiﬁcantly elevated at 1, 30, or
250 ng/ml NGF (n⫽6 –22 wells for each genotype at
each treatment, P⬍0.05 using a one-way ANOVA with
Dunnet’s post hoc testing using absence of NGF as the
control value). Treatment with NGF did not signiﬁcantly
alter potassium-stimulated iCGRP release from Nf1⫹/⫺
sensory neurons, and so the difference in potassium-stim-
ulated peptide release between genotypes that was ob-
served in the absence of NGF was not observed when
cells were grown in media with added NGF. When Nf1⫹/⫺
neurons were treated with 30 or 250 ng/ml NGF, the cap-
saicin-stimulated release was higher than that in the ab-
sence of NGF (n⫽6 –22 wells for each genotype at each
treatment, P⬍0.05 using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s
post hoc testing using absence of NGF as the control
value). These data demonstrate that NGF treatment mim-
ics the effect of the Nf1 mutation on potassium-stimulated
release of iCGRP, but that the capsaicin-stimulated re-

lease can be enhanced by a similar degree in sensory
neurons from either genotype.

In another series of experiments, isolated sensory neu-
rons were maintained in exogenous NGF (1–250 ng/ml) for
3 days only. After this treatment period, the neurons were
maintained in media without added NGF for 48 h prior to
the release experiments. Although NGF treatment again
caused an increase in stimulus-evoked release of iCGRP
from wildtype sensory neurons, there was also a pro-
nounced concentration-related enhancement of iCGRP re-
lease from Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons (see Fig. 4). This
difference is most clear in the response to capsaicin
where, for example, the stimulated release of iCGRP was
5.7⫾0.85% of total content in the absence of added NGF,
14⫾3.1% in the presence of 250 ng/ml NGF for 5–7 days
(Fig. 3b), but was 43⫾13% from neurons treated with
250 ng/ml NGF for only 3 days.

Taken together, these data clearly show that there is
an enhanced sensitivity of Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons to
stimulus-evoked release of neuropeptides, either from spi-
nal cord slices or isolated sensory neurons maintained in
culture. This sensitization can be mimicked in wildtype
sensory neurons by growing the cells in NGF. In addition,
removal of added NGF 48 h before the release experiment
allowed even greater levels of stimulus-evoked release
from Nf1⫹/⫺ preparations in comparison to neurons from
Nf1⫹/⫺ mice that received treatment with NGF through-
out. This result suggests that continuous treatment with
NGF causes the initiation of compensatory mechanisms

were grown in the presence of absence or presence of NGF for 3 days. The medium was changed to that containing no added NGF 48 h before release
experiments were performed. Neurons that did not receive NGF treatment were maintained in culture for 7 days. Release stimulated by a 10 min

which reduce the level of sensitization that can be
achieved in the Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons.

DISCUSSION

As shown above, primary sensory neurons that have a
the Nf1 gene, exhibit enhanced stimulus-
mutation of
evoked release of neuropeptides. In this mouse model of
the human disorder, NF1, there is reduced production of
neuroﬁbromin, a GAP for Ras (Jacks et al., 1994; Vogel et
al., 1995; Klesse and Parada, 1998). To date, there has
been little direct investigation of Ras activation in periph-
eral sensitization and no examination of the role of GAPs in
this process. Since the Ras transduction cascade can be
critical to the signaling of numerous inﬂammatory growth
factors and cytokines, better understanding of the regula-
tion of this pathway is important in elucidating the mecha-
nisms of peripheral sensitization. For example, pERK lev-
els are elevated in cells of the DRG after capsaicin treat-
ment or electrical stimulation in the periphery (Dai et al.,
2002). Similar increases in pERK were seen in DRG that
were treated with complete Freund’s adjuvant to cause
peripheral inﬂammation (Obata et al., 2003). In addition,
spinal nerve ligation in the rat increases levels of phos-
phorylated p38 (another member of the MAPK pathway) in
DRG ﬁve hours post-procedure (Schafers et al., 2003).
Thus, these studies suggest that downstream effectors of
the Ras transduction pathway are activated during injury
and inﬂammation.

Regulation of the levels of Ras-GTP by GAPs, such as
neuroﬁbromin, is an important point of modulation of these
cascades and, as we have shown, a mutation that causes
a reduction of functional neuroﬁbromin results in the sen-
sitization of sensory neurons. This sensitization was ob-
served in spinal cord slices that contain the central termi-
nals of primary sensory neurons. The dorsal horn of the
spinal cord contains the central terminals of primary sen-
sory neurons that release peptide neurotransmitters when
stimulated. Capsaicin selectively activates small diameter
nociceptive sensory neurons (Bevan and Szolcsányi,
1990; Holzer, 1991), and so is a useful agent to target the
primary sensory nerve endings involved in pain signaling in
the spinal cord slices which contains many types of neu-
ronal and non-neuronal cells. An enhanced response to
stimulation also was observed in isolated Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory
neurons maintained in culture. The observation of increased
stimulus-evoked neuropeptide release in both preparations
demonstrates that the enhanced response was not an
artifact of culturing the neurons, nor a result of actions by
non-neuronal cells or interneurons in the spinal cord. The
enhanced release of iCGRP from Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons was
observed using either high extracellular potassium or cap-
saicin as a stimulus. This observation suggests that the
mechanisms for sensitization in Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons are not
restricted to modulation of TRPV1 receptors, but involve a
more general modulation of ion channels or peptide re-
lease mechanisms in nociceptive sensory neurons. Eluci-
dating these targets will be critical for further understand-

ing of the mechanisms underlying the sensitization ob-
served with the Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons.

NF1 is a common human genetic disease character-
ized by numerous abnormalities that include benign and
malignant tumors. However, people with NF1 often expe-
rience abnormal painful sensations, such as hyperalgesia,
dysesthesias and allodynia, and painful itching or pruritus,
particularly in response to injury or minor trauma (Riccardi
and Eichner, 1992; Creange et al., 1999; Wolkenstein et
al., 2001). The enhanced release of iCGRP from Nf1⫹/⫺
spinal cord slices and isolated sensory neurons is consis-
tent with the enhanced sensory symptoms in those af-
ﬂicted with NF1. In addition to nociceptive sensory neu-
rons, other cell types may be affected. For example, the
function of mast cells is altered by mutation of the Nf1 gene
wherein mast cell progenitors from Nf1⫹/⫺ mice have
increased activity of the Ras pathway in response to stem
cell factor as well as a gain of function for a variety of
cellular processes including proliferation, survival, chemo-
taxis and degranulation (Ingram et al., 2000, 2001). Al-
though, our studies have focused on the direct effects of
the Nf1 mutation on the sensitization of sensory neurons
by assessing stimulus-evoked neuropeptide release, we
cannot exclude a role for non-neuronal tissues in contrib-
uting to the responses of Nf1⫹/⫺ spinal cord tissue and
DRG neurons in the absence or presence of NGF. Cer-
tainly, mast cells, Schwann cells, ﬁbroblasts and other
cells are likely to play a role in the enhanced sensory
responses of people with NF1 who experience injury.

Our observation that the stimulus-evoked release of
iCGRP was enhanced in wildtype mouse sensory neurons
treated with NGF was not surprising and such ﬁndings
have been observed before in similar rodent preparations
(Southall and Vasko, 2000). The NGF-induced sensitiza-
tion of iCGRP release from wildtype sensory neurons was
similar whether the neurons were treated continuously for
5–7 days or when the NGF was removed 48 h before
release experiments were performed. In contrast, Nf1⫹/⫺
sensory neurons continuously exposed to NGF did not
exhibit an enhancement in potassium-stimulated iCGRP
release and the effects of NGF treatment on capsaicin-
stimulated release were small, albeit signiﬁcant at 30 and
250 ng/ml. Because of the difference in the responsive-
ness of the sensory neurons from the two genotypes to
NGF, the signiﬁcant difference in iCGRP release between
genotypes that was observed in the absence of added
NGF was negated. However, when NGF was removed
48 h before release experiments were performed, the aug-
mentation of stimulus-evoked release of
iCGRP from
Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons compared with wildtype neurons was
observed. In fact, the magnitude of the capsaicin-stimu-
lated release in preparations treated with NGF for three
days was close to double that from those receiving contin-
uous NGF treatment for 5–7 days. One component of the
enhanced capsaicin-stimulated response is likely second-
ary to the increased expression of TRPV1 in response to
NGF. Treatment with constitutively active Ras mimics the
action of NGF to increase TRPV1 expression on isolated
sensory neurons (Bron et al., 2003). NGF-induced in-

644

creases in the expression of the TRPV1 receptor in DRG
neurons have been associated with activation of p38 (Ji et
al., 2002), as well as increases in pERK and pAkt (Bron et
al., 2003). In addition, the Mek inhibitor, PD98059, reduced
capsaicin sensitivity of neurons that were treated with NGF
for a week (Ganju et al., 1998). In the Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory
neurons, NGF-induced activation of the Ras transduction
cascade may be augmented by decreased neuroﬁbromin
levels. The lack of a critical GAP could result in increased
TRPV1 expression in the Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons compared with
wildtype neurons with normal GAP activity.

It seems unlikely that the lack of enhanced release in
the cultures of Nf1⫹/⫺ cells treated continuously with NGF
was secondary to having reached a maximal level of stim-
ulation or releasable peptide, since greater release was
achieved in neurons receiving only three days of NGF
treatment. Instead, our data suggest that there may be
compensatory mechanisms that are modulating NGF-
induced sensitization of the neurons with reduced neuro-
ﬁbromin, but that these mechanisms are reversible when
NGF is removed. Indeed, the NGF-mediated changes in
tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium and delayed-rectiﬁer potas-
sium currents in isolated rat sensory neurons resolve
within 20 min after removing the NGF (Zhang et al., 2002).
In Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons, some of NGF’s actions to
enhance peptide release may be blocked by the conse-
quences of a constitutively active Ras transduction cas-
cade; explaining the lack of a robust effect of continuous
NGF treatment on peptide release from Nf1⫹/⫺ neurons
compared with that from wildtype neurons. Other actions of
NGF to sensitize Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons may not be
blocked by a constitutively active Ras transduction cas-
cade and may persist after the removal of NGF for as long
as 48 h; explaining the enhanced peptide release from
neurons treated with NGF for only the ﬁrst 3 days in
culture. The Nf1⫹/⫺ sensory neurons may serve as an
excellent model to determine the potentially multiple cellu-
lar pathways mediating NGF-induced changes in peptide
release.

It is clear from our data that GAPs, such as neuroﬁbro-
min, are important in regulating the sensitization of sensory
neurons. The response to an inﬂammatory mediator, such
as NGF, is altered by mutation of the Nf1 gene which may
explain the abnormal painful responses to injury seen in
people with NF1. Further study of the role of GAPs in the
sensitization of sensory neurons may lead to better under-
standing of the chronic pain experienced by those with
NF1 and may help elucidate key mechanisms of peripheral
sensitization associated with other chronic pain conditions.
