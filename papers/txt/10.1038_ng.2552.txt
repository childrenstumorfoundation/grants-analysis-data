One-third of all primary central nervous system tumors in 
adults are meningiomas1. Rarely, meningiomas occur at 
multiple sites, usually occurring in individuals with type 2 
neurofibromatosis (NF2). We sequenced the exomes of three 
unrelated individuals with familial multiple spinal meningiomas 
without NF2 mutations. We identified two individuals with 
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SWI/SNF 
chromatin-remodeling complex subunit gene SMARCE1. 
Sequencing of SMARCE1 in six further individuals with spinal 
meningiomas identified two additional heterozygous loss-of-
function mutations. Tumors from individuals with SMARCE1 
mutations were of clear-cell histological subtype, and all had 
loss of SMARCE1 protein, consistent with a tumor suppressor 
mechanism. Our findings identify multiple-spinal-meningioma 
disease as a new discrete entity and establish a key role for the 
SWI/SNF complex in the pathogenesis of both meningiomas 
and tumors with clear-cell histology.

Meningiomas are generally slow-growing tumors derived from the 
arachnoid membrane surrounding the central nervous system (CNS). 
They are the most common CNS tumors, with an overall incidence of 
2.3 in 100,000 and a 2:1 female-male ratio1,2. About 90% of meningi-
omas occur in the cranial meninges, with the remaining 10% develop-
ing in the spinal meninges.

Meningiomas  usually  occur  sporadically  but  are  also  closely 
associated with the tumor suppressor syndrome NF2, with 50–75%  
of  individuals  with  NF2  developing  a  meningioma  during  their  
lifetime3. Loss of the wild-type NF2 allele is detected in almost all 
NF2-associated  meningiomas,  and  somatic  NF2  mutations  are 
found in the majority of sporadic meningiomas4. In approximately 
4% of cases, meningiomas occur at multiple locations in the CNS5, 
but germline NF2 mutations are rarely found in isolated adult cases  
without other features of NF2 (ref. 6).

Germline mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling com-
plex gene SMARCB1, which also cause malignant rhabdoid tumors 
and schwannomatosis, have been identified in three families with 
both multiple schwannomas and meningiomas7–9. Somatic mutations 
in SMARCB1 have been described in meningiomas10,11; however, 
screening of SMARCB1 in the germline of individuals and families 
with multiple and isolated meningiomas suggests that mutations in 
this gene do not represent a major contributor to meningioma dis-
ease11,12. It has also been suggested that familial cases of SMARCB1 
mutation–positive meningiomas have tumors preferentially localized 
to the falx cerebri of the cranium9.

In a subset of individuals, multiple-meningioma disease is a discrete 
entity, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (MIM 607174) 
with no evidence of schwannomas or other clinical symptoms of NF2 
or schwannomatosis. Further, the meningiomas in these individuals 
are not associated with loss of chromosome 22q, which harbors the 
NF2 and SMARCB1 loci13. Individuals with a first-degree relative with 
a meningioma have a threefold higher risk of developing a tumor14, 
and a recent genome-wide association study of sporadic meningiomas 
defined a new susceptibility locus at 10p12.31 (near MLLT10), which 
confers modest risk15.

To explore the genetic basis of meningiomas further and iden-
tify new targets for therapeutic intervention, we performed exome 
sequencing of three unrelated individuals with a positive family his-
tory of multiple spinal meningiomas consistent with dominant inher-
itance. All had previously tested negative for germline mutations in 
NF2 and SMARCB1 and had no other clinical evidence of NF2 or 
schwannoma disease.

Between  73%  and  77%  of  the  targeted  exome  was  covered  at 
least 20-fold for each sample. We excluded variants found in the 
dbSNP136 database. Initial filtering of the data identified no com-
pelling candidates for causative loss-of-function mutations in genes 
common to all three individuals. Because of the role of SMARCB1

Figure 1  Pedigrees of families with spinal meningioma with SMARCE1 
mutations. (a–d) Pedigrees and identified SMARCE1 mutations for  
family 1 (a), family 2 (b), family 3 (c) and family 4 (d). Filled symbols 
indicate individuals affected by spinal meningiomas. Chromatograms 
of the germline SMARCE1 point mutation identified in each affected 
individual are shown.

in CNS tumors, we focused the screen of sequence data to prioritize 
the identification of loss-of-function, previously unreported variants 
in subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. Previously unreported het-
erozygous variants in SMARCE1 were noted and verified by Sanger 
sequencing in two of the three affected individuals. The first was a 
mutation at the first base of exon 9, c.715C>T (p.Arg239*) (family 1; 
Fig. 1a), which introduces a stop codon and is predicted to result in 
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of the resultant transcript. 
This variant was also present in an affected daughter. The second 
variant was an exon 5 splice-site mutation, c.237+2T>C (family 2; 
Fig. 1b), also present in the affected mother but not in an unaffected 
sister. Analysis of cDNA derived from lymphocyte RNA from this 
individual identified two alternatively spliced SMARCE1 transcripts 
that were not present in controls. The first contained an insertion 
of the first 18 bases of intron 5, which introduced an in-frame pre-
mature stop codon after three codons and is predicted to lead to 
decay (Supplementary Fig. 1). The second transcript was less abun-
dant and contained an in-frame deletion of exon 5 (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). Skipping of exon 5 is predicted to remove the start of the 
high-mobility-group (HMG) domain. Previous studies have shown 
that human T cells lacking the SMARCE1 HMG domain are defective 
in the normal regulation of CD4/CD8 receptor expression16.

Sanger sequencing of SMARCE1 in lymphocyte DNA from six fur-
ther individuals with spinal meningiomas identified two additional 
previously unreported loss-of-function mutations (families 3 and 4; 
Fig. 1c,d and Table 1). None of the mutations were present in the 
Exome Variant Server (EVS6500) of over 6,500 exomes, our in-house 

database of >150 exomes or a panel of 100 south Asian control sam-
ples (for family 1). Only one potential loss-of-function variant in 
SMARCE1 was present in the EVS data, with a nonsense mutation in 
the penultimate codon of the last exon, which is likely to escape NMD. 
Sequencing SMARCE1 in lymphocyte DNA from 34 individuals with 
multiple cranial meningiomas did not identify any mutations, sug-
gesting that the mutations are specific for spinal tumors.

The mutations segregated with a spinal meningioma phenotype in 
families from which samples from additional family members were 
available. Notably, in family 4, the frameshift mutation present in the 
proband (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2) was not detected in 
buccal or lymphocyte DNA from her mother, who had an olfactory  
groove  (cranial)  meningioma,  but  was  present  in  her  clinically 
 unaffected father. It is notable that within our collection of 13 indi-
viduals with spinal meningiomas from 9 families, 12 are female. This 
bias may reflect incomplete penetrance in males and is analogous 
to the difference between the sexes in the penetrance of the genes 
responsible for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). 
Mutations in MLH1 and MLH2 have 80% penetrance for colorectal  
cancer  in  males  and  40%  in  females17.  A  hormonal  influence  on 
 penetrance is suggested by the presentation of tumors in both affected 
women in family 2 and the proband in family 4 during pregnancy.

We sequenced SMARCE1 in DNA extracted from tumor tissue, 
where available, in individuals with germline mutations to deter-
mine whether there was evidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), 
consistent with a tumor suppressor mode of action. In family 3, the  
exon 6 mutation (c.311G>A) was heterozygous in one tumor, whereas 
a second tumor showed retention of the mutant allele with loss of the 
wild-type allele. In family 4, the exon 8 mutation present in the germ-
line of the affected daughter was heterozygous in her tumor.

All spinal tumors from SMARCE1 mutation–positive individuals were 
consistent with clear-cell histology (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry 
on  3  tumors  from  affected  individuals  from  family  2  showed  that 
SMARCE1 protein was absent, whereas mutation-negative tissue from 
2 cranial meningiomas and a panel of 12 sporadic spinal meningi-
omas (4 transitional, 4 psammomatous and 4 atypical) showed diffuse 
positive staining (representative examples shown in Supplementary 
Fig. 3).  Staining  of  a  spinal  (clear-cell)  tumor  from  the  mutation-
 positive proband (II-1) of family 4 showed loss of SMARCE1 staining 
(Fig. 2c), whereas the cranial (transitional) tumor from her mutation-
negative mother showed diffuse positive staining (Fig. 2d), confirm-
ing that the mother’s tumor is coincidental to the diagnosis of spinal 
meningioma in her daughter. Occasional nuclear staining observed 
within SMARCE1-negative tumor tissue seems to be attributable to the 
presence of macrophages and small T lymphocytes (Supplementary 
Fig. 4) and might account for the inconsistent LOH results, although 
other mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may be responsible 
for inactivation of the second allele.

SMARCE1 is an 11-exon gene on chromosome 17q21 that encodes 
the 57-kDa subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, also termed BAF57. It 
is present only in higher eukaryotes18 and is found in all mammalian 
SWI/SNF complexes. SMARCE1 isoforms lacking exons 3 and 4 are 
confined to neurons19. SWI/SNF multisubunit complexes regulate 
chromatin structure by nucleosome remodeling. Each complex con-
tains one of two mutually exclusive catalytic ATPase subunits (either 
SMARCA2 or SMARCA4), a set of highly conserved core subunits 
(for example, SMARCB1, SMARCC1 and SMARCC2) and variant 
subunits,  including  SMARCE1.  SMARCE1  has  many  functions, 
including the induction of apoptosis by stimulating expression of the 
cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, CYLD20. Therefore, loss of its 
activity might lead to the uncoupling of apoptotic control, consistent 
with the previous identification of SMARCE1 somatic mutations in 
breast cancer21–25.

Loss of SMARCE1 expression in spinal meningioma tissue is con-
sistent with a tumor suppressor mode of action. Both SMARCB1 and 
SMARCE1 are Gli-interacting proteins, and loss of SMARCB1 leads 
to activation of the Hedgehog-Gli pathway, which might in turn lead 
to uncontrolled cell growth26. In addition, the known Hedgehog-Gli 
pathway inhibitor gene SUFU has recently been identified as the caus-
ative gene in a single family with multiple meningiomas, supporting 
a role for this pathway in meningioma pathology27.

In contrast to meningiomas in individuals with SMARCB1 mutations, 
where somatic NF2 mutation occurs, only one individual with a germ-
line SMARCE1 mutation showed somatic LOH at the NF2 locus. This 
suggests a different mechanism of action that does not require muta-
tion of both NF2 and SMARCE1. Although familial multiple-cranial-
meningioma disease is well recognized3,28, familial spinal-meningioma 
disease has not been previously described. Our studies define it as a 
discrete, genetically heterogeneous disorder, as SMARCE1 mutations 
were only identified in four of nine affected families. Because all of the 

tumors from our mutation-positive spinal meningioma cases showed 
clear-cell histology, it is likely that SMARCE1 mutations are specific  
to this meningioma subtype. Indeed, somatic mutations in the SWI/SNF 
subunit genes ARID1A and PBRM1 are major drivers in both ovarian 
and renal clear-cell tumor subtypes, respectively29–31.

Heterozygous germline mutations in multiple members of the SWI/
SNF complex, including ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA2, SMARCA4 
and  SMARCB1,  have  been  described  recently  in  individuals  with 
Coffin-Siris syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder character-
ized by growth and intellectual disability, microcephaly, coarse facial 
features and nail hypoplasia32,33 A single germline de novo missense 
SMARCE1 mutation (encoding p.Tyr73Cys) was also reported in an 
individual with Coffin-Siris syndrome32. Apart from a single case 
report of an individual with Coffin-Siris syndrome and schwanno-
matosis34, CNS tumors are rare in Coffin-Siris syndrome, suggesting 
that loss-of-function mutations in SMARCE1 predispose to a specific 
disease phenotype, as none of the individuals we studied with spinal 
meningiomas had additional neurodevelopmental problems.

Our studies define a new role for SMARCE1 in the pathogenesis 
of multiple spinal meningiomas and reinforce the importance of the 
SWI/SNF complex in tumors with clear-cell histology. These studies 
will allow accurate risk estimation in affected families, facilitating 
appropriate screening and investigation into the role of modulators 
of chromatin remodeling in treatment.

Subjects. All multiple-meningioma cases in this study had previously tested 
negative for constitutional mutations in both NF2 and SMARCB1 in genomic 
DNA from peripheral lymphocytes with whole-gene sequencing and multiplex 
ligation–dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probe sets P258-B1 and P044 
(MRC-Holland). The study was approved by the North West 7 Research Ethics 
Committee–GM Central–10/H1008/74. Informed consent was obtained from 
all participants.

Exome sequencing. Whole-exome targeted enrichment and sequencing were 
performed on lymphocyte DNA extracted from three individuals from three 
families with multiple spinal meningiomas. Enrichment was performed using the 
SureSelect Human All Exon kit v.1 (Agilent) for the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 
system. Emulsion PCR (ePCR) was carried out on the enriched sample library, 
and products were sequenced on a SOLiD 4 sequencer (Life Technologies). 
Sequence data were mapped to the hg19 reference human genome using SOLiD 
BioScope software (Life Technologies). SNPs were called using the diBayes tool in 
the BioScope software suite with the medium stringency setting, which requires at 
least 1–25× coverage and that the variant be seen in either the forward or reverse 
strand. An initial filter was used to remove SNPs with an overall sequence depth 
of <5×. This strategy retains sufficient numbers of variants without unreasonably 
increasing the false negative rate. Indels were included with a sequence depth 
of >5× and a range of end positions between 15–40 bp. A more stringent filter 
was applied to SNPs to ensure that all novel allele counts were ≥18× with a  
corresponding novel mean quality value of ≥18×. Subsequent interpretive analysis 
prioritizing novel putative loss-of-function variants (nonsense and frameshift 
mutations) was used to decide which genes should be analyzed further. After 

eliminating all candidate variants, the stringency was reduced to 17× coverage 
to allow for a lower novel allele read count.

Sanger sequencing. Mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed 
by direct Sanger sequencing. Primers were designed to amplify individual exons, 
including approximately 50 bases of flanking intronic sequence, and samples were 
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 system (Life Technologies).

RNA  analysis.  RNA  was  extracted  from  peripheral  lymphocytes  using 
PAXgene  Blood  RNA  tubes  and  the  PAXgene  Blood  RNA  Extraction  kit 
(Qiagen). RNA was converted to cDNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-
cDNA kit (Life Technologies). A fragment of the SMARCE1 transcript was 
amplified in the sample from family 2 and in a control cDNA sample using 
primers designed for exons 3 and 7. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 
2% agarose gel, and three bands were resolved. Each band was excised from the 
gel and purified using a QiaEx II Gel Purification column (Qiagen). Purified 
products were analyzed by Sanger sequencing.

Immunohistochemistry. Spinal meningiomas from affected individuals from 
families 2 and 4 were immunostained for SMARCE1 protein. Briefly, paraf-
fin sections were cut at 4 µm, dried for 4 h at 37 °C and incubated for 1 h at  
60  °C.  Sections  were  then  stained  with  a  1:100  dilution  of  antibody  to 
SMARCE1 (HPA00396, Sigma-Aldrich) using an indirect peroxidase method 
on the Roche Ultra IHC Autostainer. Cells were counterstained with hema-
toxylin II and bluing reagent. Sections were then dehydrated through three 
changes of absolute 100% methylated spirits and cleared in three changes of 
xylene, before being mounting in Pertex mountant.
