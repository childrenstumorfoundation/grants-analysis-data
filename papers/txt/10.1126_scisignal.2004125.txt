Oncogenic K-Ras proteins, such as K-RasG12D, accumulate in the active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–
bound conformation and stimulate signaling through effector kinases. The presence of the K-RasG12D
oncoprotein at a similar abundance to that of endogenous wild-type K-Ras results in only minimal phos-
phorylation and activation of the canonical Raf–mitogen-activated or extracellular signal–regulated protein
kinase kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–
Akt–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascades in primary hematopoietic cells, and
these pathways remain dependent on growth factors for efficient activation. We showed that phospholipase
C–g (PLC-g), PI3K, and their generated second messengers link activated cytokine receptors to Ras and
ERK signaling in differentiated bone marrow cells and in a cell population enriched for leukemia stem cells.
Cells expressing endogenous oncogenic K-RasG12D remained dependent on the second messenger
diacylglycerol for the efficient activation of Ras-ERK signaling. These data raise the unexpected pos-
sibility of therapeutically targeting proteins that function upstream of oncogenic Ras in cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Ras proteins are signal switch molecules that regulate cell fate by cycling
between active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–bound (Ras-GTP) and in-
active, guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–bound (Ras-GDP) conformations
(1, 2). Cancer-associated mutant RAS alleles encode oncogenic proteins that
accumulate in the GTP-bound conformation because of a defective intrinsic
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and their resistance to GTPase-
activating proteins (GAPs) (1–3). On the basis of the high prevalence of so-
matic RAS mutations in many lethal human malignancies, reversing the
biochemical consequences of oncogenic Ras signaling is of fundamental im-
portance for reducing the worldwide burden of cancer. However, the Ras
GTPase switch poses extraordinary problems for anticancer drug develop-
ment because an “ideal” agent must restore normal GTPase activity and re-
sponsiveness to GAPs (that is, it must repair a “broken” enzyme) in the
context of a highly constrained domain of Ras in which the g phosphate of
GTP interacts with the “arginine finger” of GAPs (1–3). On the basis of the
assumption that oncogenic Ras-GTP makes cancer cells less reliant on growth
factors for survival and proliferation by constitutively activating downstream
signaling pathways, intensive efforts are focusing on developing and eval-
uating small-molecule inhibitors of Ras effectors, particularly components
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt–mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) and Raf–mitogen-activated or extracellular signal–regulated pro-
tein kinase kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)
pathways (4). Recent studies also raise the possibilities of therapeutically

targeting other domains of Ras oncoproteins (5) or interfering with their
posttranslational processing (6, 7).

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and chronic myelomono-
cytic leukemia (CMML) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) that fre-
quently contain “driver” mutations in genes encoding components of Ras
signaling networks such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, CBL, and NF1 (8, 9).
Germline PTPN11, CBL, and NF1 mutations confer an increased risk of
JMML, which implicates hyperactive Ras as initiating this aggressive leuke-
mia. Bone marrow cells from JMML patients form granulocyte-macrophage
colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) colonies in the absence of cytokine growth
factors and at very low concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This cellular hallmark of JMML is also ob-
served in bone marrow cells from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice (10, 11). These
mice express oncogenic KrasG12D from its endogenous locus in hematopoietic
cells and develop a fatal MPN that recapitulates many features of CMML and
JMML (10–12).

Although Ras-GTP abundance is constitutively increased in bone mar-
row cells from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice compared to that in cells from wild-
type mice, the amounts of phosphorylated Akt and ERK (pAkt and pERK) in
cells from these mice are not changed or only minimally increased compared
to those in wild-type mice. Bone marrow cells from both wild-type and Mx1-
Cre, KrasG12D mice exhibit markedly increased pAkt and pERK abundance
in response to stimulation with GM-CSF (10). Consistent with these bio-
chemical data, CFU-GM colony growth is greatly enhanced by GM-CSF
(10, 12). Similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
mice show little or no basal activation of canonical effector pathways
despite their enhanced abundance of Ras-GTP, and they exhibit marked
increases in pERK and pAkt abundances in response to epidermal growth
factor (13, 14). Administering PD0325901, a potent and selective MEK
inhibitor, to Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice with MPN results in substantial
hematologic improvement, characterized by a restoration of normal white
blood cell counts, an improvement in anemia, and a reduction in splenic

enlargement (15). This observation provides direct evidence that aberrant Raf-
MEK-ERK signaling underlies the aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic
cells in vivo in this model of human MPN. Understanding the biochemical
mechanisms required for the full activation of oncogenic Ras in response
to growth factor stimulation might therefore reveal new therapeutic targets.
On the basis of the extensive cell biologic, genetic, and preclinical data
implicating aberrant GM-CSF signaling in the pathogenesis of JMML, we
combined phospho–flow cytometric analysis and pharmacological pathway
mapping (16) to clarify the molecular mechanisms linking the stimula-
tion of primary hematopoietic cells with GM-CSF to the activation of ERK
(11, 15, 17–19). Here, we show that phospholipase C–g (PLC-g) and
PI3K were essential for efficient Ras and ERK activation and that analogs
of diacylglycerol (DAG), the second messenger generated by PLC-g, bypassed
this requirement. Despite having substantially increased amounts of Ras-GTP
compared to hematopoietic cells from wild-type mice, hematopoietic cells
from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice remained dependent on PLC-g and PI3K for
efficient activation of ERK. Inhibitors of PLC-g and PI3K also interfered
with ERK phosphorylation and activation in response to stem cell factor
(SCF) in immature populations of bone marrow cells from wild-type and
Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice that were enriched for hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) and leukemia-initiating cells. Studies of hematopoietic progenitor col-
ony growth and of cytokine signaling after treatment of mice with a PI3K
inhibitor confirmed the physiological relevance of this pathway. Together,
these data raise the possibility that targeting proteins that function upstream
of oncogenic Ras—alone or in combination with other therapies—may repre-
sent a viable strategy for treating cancers, particularly those that are highly re-
sponsive to growth factors. In addition, these data suggest that PI3K inhibitors
could contribute to myelosuppression by interfering with cytokine signal-
ing networks in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

RESULTS

PLC-g and PI3K stimulate ERK activation in
hematopoietic cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre,
KrasG12D mice
Compared to those of wild-type mice, the bone marrows of Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
mice contain a preponderance of myeloid cells with a corresponding loss of
erythroid and lymphoid cell populations (10, 11). These changes in cellular
composition might increase the apparent response to a stimulus that acts on
myeloid cells alone. Phospho–flow cytometry avoids this problem by analyz-
ing signaling at the single-cell level in a heterogeneous tissue such as bone
marrow (20, 21). We therefore used this methodology to characterize cytokine
responses in bone marrow cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice.
Our analysis focused on differentiated myeloid lineage cells (mostly mature
granulocytes and monocytes) that expressed the Mac1 and Gr1 cell surface
markers (M+G+ cells), as well as the c-Kit+Mac1–Gr1– (K+M–G–) population,
which was enriched for stem and progenitor cells and constituted 2 to 5% of
nucleated bone marrow cells (fig. S1). We found that basal amounts of pERK
were comparable in wild-type and KrasG12D M+G+ and K+M–G– bone mar-
row cells (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A). Although the bone marrow of Mx1-Cre,
KrasG12D mice contained more GM-CSF–responsive M+G+ cells than did
the bone marrow from wild-type mice (fig. S1), the extent of ERK phospho-
rylation within responding cells was comparable in wild-type and KrasG12D
cells (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A, green curves). KrasG12D cells were dependent on
GM-CSF stimulation to activate ERK (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A).

Upon ligand binding, the common b chain of the GM-CSF receptor is
phosphorylated by Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2), generating docking
sites for signaling molecules and adaptor proteins (22). To investigate the
molecular mechanism linking GM-CSF to ERK activation, we exposed bone

marrow cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice to a panel of ki-
nase inhibitors. Cells incubated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (23)
served as a positive control for measuring inhibition of ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 1A and fig. S2A). As expected, JakI, an inhibitor of JAK proteins, ab-
rogated GM-CSF–dependent ERK phosphorylation in wild-type and Mx1-
Cre, KrasG12D bone marrow cells. In contrast, GM-CSF–dependent ERK
activation was unimpaired by the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2,
despite there being a marked reduction in the total abundance of tyrosine-
phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1A and fig. S2, A and B). GM-CSF–induced
ERK phosphorylation was also unimpaired in cells that were exposed to the
protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I) (Fig. 1A).
Pretreatment of cells with chemical inhibitors of PLC-g (U73122) (24, 25)
or PI3K (PI-90) (26) reduced the ability of GM-CSF to increase pERK
abundance in differentiated M+G+ and immature K+M–G– cells from wild-
type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A).

The responses of M+G+ and K+M–G– cells to GM-CSF and chemical
inhibitors differed in some respects (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A). Wild-type and
Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D M+G+ cells had low basal amounts of pERK compared
to those of K+M–G– cells, and inhibition of PLC-g or PI3K almost completely
abrogated ERK activation by GM-CSF (Fig. 1A). GM-CSF elicited a more
heterogeneous pattern of ERK phosphorylation in K+M–G– cells, which is
consistent with the expectation that only the myeloid subset of this mixed
population will respond to GM-CSF (fig. S2A). U73122 completely blocked
this response, whereas K+M–G– cells that were exposed to PI-90 showed
some residual ERK activation upon GM-CSF stimulation (fig. S2A).

SCF stimulates the proliferation of HSCs and progenitor cells through
binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit. Somatic KIT mutations
that constitutively activate the intrinsic kinase activity of c-Kit are found in
acute myeloid leukemia (27, 28). We investigated the effects of small-molecule
inhibitors on SCF-stimulated ERK activation in K+M–G– cells, which uniformly
express c-Kit. As reported previously (21), the phosphorylation of ERK in re-
sponse to SCF was impaired in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells compared to that in
wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). As expected, JakI had no effect on SCF-induced
ERK activation, whereas inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases (PP2) markedly
reduced SCF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Similar to our findings from
experiments with cells stimulated with GM-CSF, PKC inhibitors had no effect
on the ability of SCF to stimulate ERK activation. We found that U73122 and
PI-90 markedly reduced the ability of SCF to induce ERK phosphorylation in
K+M–G– cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice (Fig. 1B). To-
gether, these data place PLC-g and PI3K upstream of ERK activation in
GM-CSF and SCF signaling pathways in differentiated and immature mye-
loid lineage cells from both wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice.

Inhibitors of PLC-g and PI3K have effects on Ras-GTP
abundance in bone marrow from wild-type and
Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice
To clarify the level at which PLC-g and PI3K regulated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
signaling, we measured Ras-GTP abundance in bone marrow cells from wild-
type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice before and after stimulation with GM-CSF.
As expected, GM-CSF induced GTP loading on Ras in wild-type bone mar-
row cells. This response was reduced by chemical inhibitors of JAKs, PLC-g,
or PI3K, all of which also abrogated or markedly reduced the extent of ERK
phosphorylation (Fig. 1C and fig. S3). Whereas the PKC inhibitor BIM I also
reduced the GM-CSF–dependent generation of Ras-GTP, ERK activation was
normal. As expected, PD0325901 completely eliminated ERK phospho-
rylation in response to GM-CSF, but had no effect on Ras-GTP abundance
(Fig. 1C and fig. S3C). PI-90 and U73122 also markedly reduced Akt phos-
phorylation (fig. S3D).

Consistent with our phospho–flow cytometry data (Fig. 1, A and B)
and a previous report (10), ERK is only minimally phosphorylated in

Fig. 1. PI-90 and U73122 impair Ras and ERK activation in wild-
type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D hematopoietic cells and reduce PLC-g
phosphorylation. (A) M+G+ cells from wild-type (WT) and Mx1-Cre,
KrasG12D (KrasG12D) mice were incubated for 30 min with the indicated
inhibitors (each at a final concentration of 5 mM), stimulated with
GM-CSF for 10 min, and then analyzed by phospho–flow cytometry
to determine the abundance of pERK. Basal indicates cells that were
treated with neither inhibitor nor cytokine. The red vertical lines indi-
cate basal median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values. (B) K+M–G–
cells from WT and KrasG12D mice were incubated for 30 min with the
same inhibitors used in (A) before they were stimulated with SCF for
15 min and then analyzed by phospho–flow cytometry to determine
pERK abundance. (C) Ras-GTP and pERK abundances were mea-
sured by Western blotting analysis of bone marrow cells from WT and
KrasG12D mice (as described in Materials and Methods) that were
treated with the indicated inhibitors before being stimulated with
GM-CSF. Actin was used as a loading control. (D) The amounts of
phosphorylated PLC-g1 (pPLC-g1) and PLC-g2 (pPLC-g2) were deter-
mined by flow cytometric analysis of WT and KrasG12D mouse bone
marrow M+G+ cells that were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors
before being stimulated with GM-CSF. Data in all panels are represent-
ative of two to five independent experiments, with data from additional
independent experiments shown in figs. S2, B and C, and S3.

unstimulated bone marrow cells from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice despite
a constitutive increase in Ras-GTP abundance (Fig. 1C). We detected
equivalent abundances of Ras, PLC-g1, PLC-g2, Akt, MEK, and ERK
in the bone marrow cells of wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice,
and therefore used actin as a general loading control for subsequent
Western blotting experiments (fig. S3A). Upon exposure to GM-CSF,
these cells robustly generated pERK without further increasing Ras-
GTP abundance (fig. S3C). Whereas JakI, PI-90, and U73122 did
not alter the high basal abundance of Ras-GTP in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
mouse bone marrow cells, each inhibitor markedly impaired ERK ac-
tivation in response to GM-CSF in these cells (Fig. 1A and fig. S3, C
and D). Together, these data place PLC-g and PI3K upstream of Ras
in the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in primary bone marrow
cells. We also showed that the constitutively increased abundance of
Ras-GTP that resulted from endogenous oncogenic K-RasG12D was
insufficient for the efficient phosphorylation of ERK, which required
cytokine and was sensitive to inhibition of PLC-g or PI3K.

To expand on our observations of the effects of PI3K inhibition,
we treated M+G+ cells with PI-103, a dual-specificity inhibitor of PI3K
and mTOR that is structurally unrelated to PI-90 (26), and with isoform-
selective PI3K inhibitors (figs. S4 to S6). We found that PI-103 reduced
GM-CSF–stimulated ERK activation as did PI-90 and that an inhibitor
selective for the p110a and p110g isoforms of PI3K was more potent than
were inhibitors of the p110b and p110d isoforms in reducing ERK activa-
tion in cells that were stimulated with GM-CSF (figs. S5 and S6).

To further characterize the role of PLC-g in GM-CSF signaling in bone
marrow cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice, we examined
the effects of GM-CSF on the phosphorylation of PLC-g1 and PLC-g2
(pPLC-g1 and pPLC-g2, respectively) in M+G+ cells in the absence and
presence of chemical inhibitors. The basal amount of pPLC-g1 was increased
in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells compared to that in wild-type cells, and GM-CSF
stimulated the phosphorylation of both isoforms of PLC-g in cells of either
genotype (Fig. 1D and fig. S7). Pretreatment with U73122 abrogated this
response, and JakI also potently inhibited the phosphorylation of both
PLC-g1 and PLC-g2. Cells treated with PI-90 or PI-103 showed a more

modest reduction in GM-CSF–dependent pPLC-g1 or PLC-g2 generation
than was observed in cells treated with JakI or U73122 (Fig. 1D and fig. S7).

PLC-g mediates the activation of PI3K and
mitogen-activated protein kinases
To functionally study signaling networks in primary myeloid cells, we cul-
tured mouse bone marrow cells in macrophage medium that selectively en-
abled the growth of bone marrow macrophage progenitor cells (BMMPCs),
a relatively homogeneous population that exhibits activated Ras signaling in
response to GM-CSF (29, 30). The abundances of Ras and of other key sig-
naling molecules were equivalent in BMMPCs grown from wild-type and
Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice (fig. S3B). Western blotting analysis showed that
JakI, PI-90, and U73122 inhibited GM-CSF–dependent ERK activation in

BMMPCs, whereas the PKC inhibitor
BIM I had no effect (fig. S8). These
data were consistent with the observed
effects of these inhibitors on bone mar-
row M+G+ cells (Fig. 1A and fig. S2A).
The ability to culture BMMPCs from
wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D bone
marrow provided us with a robust pri-
mary cell system in which to exploit RNA
interference (RNAi) to interrogate the in-
teraction of PLC-g and PI3K in ERK ac-
tivation. We constructed retroviral vectors
encoding PLC-g–specific or control short
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), a neomycin re-
sistance gene, and a fluorescent marker
[green fluorescent protein (GFP) for
shPLC-g1 and mCherry for shPLC-g2].
After their transduction, bone marrow
cells were grown in myeloid medium
that selectively enabled the growth of
BMMPCs in the presence of the antibi-
otic G418 to increase the number of cells
expressing the shRNA constructs (fig.
S9A). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed
that most of the BMMPCs expressed
GFP or mCherry (58 to 79%; fig. S9A).
Knockdown of PLC-g2 reduced the
extent of ERK and Akt activation in re-
sponse to GM-CSF (Fig. 2A), whereas
knockdown of PLC-g1 with either shRNA
only had modest effects on pAkt induc-
tion (fig. S9B).

DAG analogs bypass
chemical inhibitors to
activate Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
signaling in BMMPCs
Activated PLC-g hydrolyzes phosphatidyl-
inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to gener-
ate DAG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
(IP3), the latter of which mobilizes intra-
cellular calcium ions (Ca2+). These second
messengers, in turn, activate PKC and gua-
nine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
of the Ras guanine nucleotide–releasing
protein (RasGRP) family (31). We com-
pared Ras-GTP abundance, as well as the
extents of ERK and Akt phosphoryl-
ation, in wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
BMMPCs that were exposed to GM-
CSF or to the DAG mimetic phorbol 12-
myristate13-acetate(PMA).We foundthat
PMA increased Ras-GTP and pERK abun-
dances in BMMPCs of both genotypes,
but that it had little or no effect on pAkt
abundance (Fig. 2B and fig. S10A).

GM-CSF also stimulated an increase
in Ras-GTP abundance and ERK phos-
phorylation in BMMPCs; however, the
time courses of these responses differed

from those of PMA (Fig. 2B and fig. S10B). In contrast to PMA, GM-CSF
also stimulated an increase in pAkt abundance (Fig. 2B and figs. S3D and
S10B). The extent and duration of Akt activation differed between wild-type
and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D BMMPCs. In particular, wild-type cells showed a
marked response 10 to 15 min after exposure to GM-CSF, whereas Kras mutant
cells had increased amounts of basal pAkt but responded less to stimulation
(Fig. 2B and fig. S10B). U73122 and PI-90 blocked the GM-CSF–dependent
increase in ERK phosphorylation in wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
BMMPCs; however, neither inhibitor altered PMA-dependent activation
of ERK (Fig. 2C and fig. S11, A and B). Furthermore, U73122 blocked the
GM-CSF–dependent phosphorylation of Akt in wild-type BMMPCs, reduced
basal amounts of pAkt in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells, and inhibited the activation
of Akt by GM-CSF in these cells (Fig. 2C and figs. S3D and S11B). Together
with the results of the phospho–flow cytometry and shRNA experiments
presented earlier, these data place PLC-g upstream of PI3K in GM-CSF signal-
ing in wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mutant hematopoietic cells.

We next asked whether the PLC-g effector Ca2+ and calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was required for efficient ERK phos-
phorylation in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D BMMPCs by assessing the inhibitory
effects of 2-APB (an IP3 receptor antagonist) and KN-62 (a CaMKII inhibi-
tor) (32). Like U73122, 2-APB and KN-62 blocked GM-CSF–dependent ERK
phosphorylation, whereas BIM I did not (fig. S12, A and B). These data are
consistent with a study showing that 2-APB and KN-62 blocked GM-CSF–
dependent ERK activation in wild-type hematopoietic cells (32).

To assess the functional requirements for PLC-g and PI3K in myeloid pro-
genitors, we grew CFU-GM colonies in methylcellulose medium containing a
saturating concentration of GM-CSF together with JakI, PI-90, U73122, or
the Akt inhibitor Akt VIII. These studies revealed dose-dependent inhibition
of CFU-GM growth of both wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D bone marrow
cells in the presence of 0.1 to 10 mM JakI, U73122, or PI-90 (Fig. 2D). We ob-
served substantial inhibition of CFU-GM growth in cells exposed to 1 to 10 mM
of each inhibitor, which correlated with biochemical inhibition of GM-CSF–
dependent ERK phosphorylation in BMMPCs (Fig. 2D and fig. S8). In con-
trast, Akt VIII had modest effects on CFU-GM growth at concentrations that
blocked Akt phosphorylation in cultured BMMPCs (Fig. 2D and fig. S8B).
Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the GM-CSF recep-
tor by JAK2 generates docking sites for PLC-g and PI3K binding. These
proteins, in turn, generate DAG, Ca2+, and PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-
trisphosphate), which function upstream of Ras in the activation of the
Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells. Fur-
thermore, multiple lines of evidence place PLC-g upstream of PI3K in mod-
ulating the response of myeloid cells to GM-CSF. First, U73122 inhibited
Akt phosphorylation, whereas PI-90 only partially reduced PLC-g activa-
tion (Figs. 1D and 2C and fig. S7). Second, knockdown of PLC-g2 marked-
ly impaired the GM-CSF–dependent phosphorylation of Akt and ERK
(Fig. 2A). Third, U73122 inhibited CFU-GM progenitor growth, whereas
Akt VIII had only modest effects (Fig. 2D).

RasGRPs potentiate the phosphorylation of ERK
We next sought DAG effectors that might contribute to the activation of Ras-
ERK signaling in BMMPCs. PKC isoforms and RasGRPs contain DAG-
binding domains and regulate the generation of Ras-GTP; however, the PKC
inhibitor BIM I did not inhibit cytokine-induced ERK activation in M+G+
or K+M–G– bone marrow cells (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S2A) or in cultured
BMMPCs (fig. S8). Furthermore, GM-CSF stimulation did not alter the phos-
phorylation states of multiple PKC isoforms in BMMPCs (fig. S13).

We next asked whether members of the RasGRP family of GEFs might
link cytokine receptor activation to the stimulation of Ras and ERK signaling.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that BMMPCs
express RasGrp3 and RasGrp4, but not RasGrp1. Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells

expressed substantially increased amounts of Rasgrp3 mRNAs compared to
wild-type cells, and Western blotting analysis showed that they had increased
amounts of RasGRP3 protein compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 3, A and B,
and fig. S14). We used RNAi to reduce RasGRP3 and RasGRP4 abundances
in BMMPCs, and assessed the effects on GM-CSF–dependent ERK phos-
phorylation (Fig. 3C and fig. S14). Knocking down RasGRP4 modestly re-
duced the extent of ERK phosphorylation in wild-type BMMPCs, whereas

ence of 10 mM PLX4720. Cells were then lysed and analyzed by Western
blotting to determine the abundances of pAkt and pERK, with actin used as
a loading control. Data are from individual representative experiments, and
data from additional independent experiments are presented in fig. S15.

knockdown of RasGRP3 had minimal effects (Fig. 3C and fig. S14). In contrast,
knockdown of either RasGRP3 or RasGRP4 inhibited GM-CSF–dependent
ERK phosphorylation in Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells (Fig. 3C and fig. S14).

PLX4720 partially reverses the inhibitory
effects of U73122 and PI-90
in bone marrow cells
The potent Raf inhibitor PLX4032 (also known as
vemurafenib) is a highly promising treatment for hu-
man cancers with somatic BRAF mutations (33, 34).
PLX4032 and the related compound PLX4720 selec-
tively reduce pERK abundance in cells expressing on-
cogenic B-Raf proteins, but paradoxically activate
signaling in the context of wild-type B-Raf through
allosteric effects on homo- and heterodimers of c-Raf
and B-Raf (35–37). Consistent with studies in other
cell types, we found that incubating bone marrow
cells from wild-type or Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice with
PLX4720 increased the abundance of pERK in re-
sponse to GM-CSF compared to that in untreated cells
(Fig. 3D and fig. S15). PLX4720 also partially antag-
onized the inhibitory effects of PI-90 and U73122 on
GM-CSF–dependent ERK phosphorylation, but, as
expected, did not overcome inhibition by PD0325901
(Fig. 3D and fig. S15). Together with data presented
earlier, these findings further support a model in
which PLC-g and PI3K link the activated GM-CSF
receptor to ERK activation through Ras and Raf.

The transplantation of purified populations of Mx1-

mice showed that HSCs initiate and maintain leu-
kemic growth in vivo (38, 39). To determine the extent
to which PLC-g and PI3K were essential for efficient
ERK activation in a population of bone marrow
cells that contain a high percentage of HSCs, we
performed phospho–flow cytometry to analyze the
kit+lindim/−
−
(KLS 48
) subset of bone
marrow cells stimulated with SCF in the presence of
the MEK inhibitor PD0325901, the PI3K inhibitor
PI-90, or the PLC-g inhibitor U73122. We found that
−
cells from wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D
KLS 48
mice showed robust ERK activation in response to SCF
(Fig. 4, A to C). As expected, PD0325901 abrogated
ERK phosphorylation in response to SCF or the com-
bination of SCF and PMA (Fig. 4A). SCF-induced
ERK activation in KLS 48− cells was also sensitive to
−
inhibition by PI-90 and U73122; however, KLS 48
cells that were also stimulated with PMA had increased
pERK abundance despite the presence of either inhib-
itor (Fig. 4, B and C). U73343, a structural analog of
U73122 that does not inhibit PLC-g activity, had no
effect on SCF-dependent ERK phosphorylation in
−
cells (fig. S16). These results are consistent
KLS 48
with the data from experiments with BMMPCs show-
ing that PLC-g and PI3K function upstream of DAG
in ERK activation.

that was efficacious in preclinical models (n = 3 per time point) and eutha-
nized the mice 2 or 6 hours later. Mice that received PD0325901 (5 mg/kg)
served as a positive control in this experiment. Treatment with a single dose
of either GDC-0941 or PD0325901 markedly reduced the extent of ERK
phosphorylation in cells that were stimulated with GM-CSF ex vivo, but
had no effect on STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5)
phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and B). These pharmacodynamic data demon-
strate that administering a therapeutically relevant dose of a PI3K inhibitor
to mice reduces the ability of bone marrow cells to activate ERK in re-
sponse to cytokines.

DISCUSSION

Here, we demonstrated cooperativity between PLC-g and PI3K in linking
GM-CSF receptor activation to Ras and ERK signaling in primary hema-
topoietic cells (Fig. 6). This module regulates growth factor responses in
immature and differentiated cells, and is engaged by cytokine receptors
with and without intrinsic RTK activity, suggesting that it may represent
a general mechanism for activating the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Inhibitors
of PLC-g and PI3K interfered with ERK phosphorylation in an enriched
population of normal and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D bone marrow cells that in-
cluded leukemia-initiating cells. Despite having markedly increased basal
amounts of Ras-GTP, cells expressing oncogenic K-RasG12D from the en-

dogenous genetic locus remained dependent on PLC-g and PI3K for efficient
ERK activation in response to GM-CSF and SCF. Studies of hematopoietic
progenitor colony growth, and of cytokine signaling after treatment with a
PI3K inhibitor in vivo, confirmed the physiological relevance of our in vitro
observations. Together, these data have implications for clinical trials that
combine Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR or PLC-g inhibitors, as
well as for nascent efforts to develop small molecules that directly target
oncogenic Ras proteins.

We addressed additional questions regarding the role of PLC-g in the
activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway by GM-CSF. First, our data show-
ing that PMA overcame the inhibitory effects of U73122 support an es-
sential role for DAG in the efficient activation of ERK. We also implicated
RasGRPs as potential effectors of DAG. Second, the ability of U73122 to
reduce Ras-GTP loading in wild-type bone marrow cells and of PLX4720
to rescue ERK phosphorylation in the presence of this inhibitor identified
Ras and Raf as linking PLC-g proteins to the activation of MEK and ERK.
Third, we showed that PI3K was also required to activate Ras and ERK in
response to cytokines. Finally, we showed that primary hematopoietic cells
with endogenous amounts of oncogenic K-RasG12D remained dependent
on PLC-g and PI3K signaling for efficient ERK activation despite having
increased basal amounts of Ras-GTP compared to those in wild-type cells.
Ras-GTP binds to and activates class I and II PI3Ks, which, in turn, are
crucial for Ras-induced transformation of many cell types. For example,
engineering oncogenic Ras proteins with
“second site” amino acid substitutions that
eliminate or severely impair PI3K binding
results in defective transforming activity
(41–43), and strains of mice lacking the
regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K or carrying
a “knock-in” mutation in the catalytic p110a
subunit that abrogates Ras binding are re-
sistant to tumorigenesis driven by expres-
sion of oncogenic K-RasG12D (44, 45). These
and other data establish PI3Ks as critical ef-
fectors of oncogenic Ras proteins in cancer
pathogenesis.

However, PI3K inhibitors can also block
the activation of Ras and ERK in some con-
texts (46–50). Three independent studies
of cultured epithelial cell lines found that
PI3K was essential for efficient ERK acti-
vation only at low concentrations of growth
factor, which likely reflects physiologic con-
ditions in most normal tissues (46, 49, 50).
Duckworth and Cantley (46) also identi-
fied a PI3K-independent PLC-g–PKC path-
way in 3T3 cells that was engaged at high
concentrations of platelet-derived growth
factor and overcame the inhibitory effects
of wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). In con-
trast, our data demonstrate that PLC-g and
PI3K cooperatively activate ERK in pri-
mary hematopoietic cells through a mecha-
nism that is very likely independent of PKCs.
These observations suggest that the archi-
tecture of signaling networks downstream
of activated growth factor receptors varies
in a tissue-specific manner. Our data showing
that U73122 and PLC-g2 knockdown greatly
reduced GM-CSF–dependent Akt phospho-

sentative of three mice for each time point. The red vertical lines display basal MFI values. (B) MFI plots of

JAK2 

γ

Fig. 6. Proposed mechanism of cytokine-induced Ras and ERK activation in hematopoietic cells ex-
pressing WT and oncogenic K-Ras. In response to the binding of GM-CSF to its receptor, JAK2 trans-
phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues on the b common chain of the GM-CSF receptor, creating docking
sites for adaptor proteins and signaling molecules. PLC-g1 and PLC-g2 are recruited to the receptor
complex and become activated, generating DAG. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K binds to the
receptor through adaptor proteins, which results in PI3K activation and PIP3 production. Second mes-
sengers generated by PI3K and PLC-g stimulate nucleotide exchange on Ras, likely by both localizing
Ras to the plasma membrane and activating RasGRPs. The DAG mimetic PMA activates Ras and ERK
independently of PLC-g and PI3K. This scheme does not directly address the interaction between
PLC-g and PI3K; however, multiple lines of evidence suggested that PLC-g is upstream of PI3K. The
levels at which the different inhibitors used in this study exerted their effects are indicated by dashed
red bars. Raf activation by PLX4720 is indicated as a dashed green arrow. Studies using many of these
inhibitors support a similar role for PLC-g and PI3K in linking the activated RTK c-Kit to Ras and ERK
signaling.

Raf-MEK-ERK signaling requires that Ras
both bind to GTP and be localized at signal-
ing complexes on activated cytokine recep-
tors. Lipid second messengers, in particular
PIP3, can recruit and retain K-Ras and other
polybasic proteins to specific domains within
the plasma membrane (52). PIP3 might also
colocalize PH domain–containing proteins,
including SOS, RasGRPs, and other guanine
nucleotide exchange factors, within mem-
brane nanoclusters to promote the assembly
of signaling complexes on activated receptors
(53, 54). It is likely that wild-type Ras local-
izes to activated cytokine receptors at which
GEFs mediate GTP loading. In contrast,
whereas oncogenic Ras accumulates in its
GTP-bound conformation in the absence of
growth factors, our data are consistent with
the idea that it still requires a localization signal
that is dependent on PLC-g and PI3K to effi-
ciently activate the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
RasGRP4, a Ras-specific GEF that is
highly abundant in myeloid cells, is mu-
tated in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia
and modulates Ras-GTP amounts in re-
sponse to PMA (55). Our data support a role
for RasGRP4 in activating Ras and ERK in
the physiologic setting of GM-CSF signaling.
Whereas RasGRP4 played a dominant role
in wild-type cells, we found that Mx1-Cre,
KrasG12D BMMPCs had increased amounts of
RasGRP3 and become dependent on this
isoform, which suggests that K-RasG12D re-
models signaling networks in unanticipated
ways. The observation that PLC-g engaged Ras
though RasGRPs in myeloid cells is consistent
with previous studies in Tand B lymphocytes
in which the PLC-g–dependent product DAG
plays a critical role in recruiting RasGRP1 and
RasGRP3 to the plasma membrane (56).

rylation in BMMPCs place PLC-g upstream of PI3K; however, PI-90 also
modestly reduced the extent of PLC-g phosphorylation, which raises the pos-
sibility that PI3K functions in a “feed-forward” manner to amplify the signal
from PLC-g (Fig. 6). We speculate that lipid second messengers generated by
PI3K and PLC-g after recruitment to growth factor receptors, specifically PIP3
and DAG, cooperate to localize and assemble signaling complexes that effi-
ciently activate exchange factors, Ras, and the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. In
agreement with the GM-CSF network that we described here for myeloid
cells, we previously showed that the increased abundance of RasGRP1 links
cytokine receptors to Ras in T cell leukemia (51). These data suggest that
different RasGRP family members regulate Ras activation in response to
cytokines in distinct hematopoietic lineages.

It is unclear why constitutively increased amounts of Ras-GTP in
Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D hematopoietic cells only minimally activate Raf-
MEK-ERK signaling. One provocative idea is that flux through the pathway
is increased, but cells use negative feedback mechanisms that reduce basal
amounts of pERK. Alternatively, we speculate that efficient activation of

These unexpected results also raise the
intriguing possibility that inhibiting the bio-
chemical output of proteins upstream of on-
cogenic Ras may represent a viable approach for treating some cancers,
particularly those that are highly responsive to growth factors. Maurer et al.
(5) used fragment-based lead discovery to develop chemical inhibitors to
a previously uncharacterized binding pocket on the surface of Ras. DCA1,
a compound from this screen, inhibits Ras activation by interfering with
SOS-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange and also likely has activity
against other GEFs (5). The results of our study support testing the ability
of DCA1 and related compounds to block GM-CSF– and SCF-mediated
ERK activation in wild-type and Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D cells to further evalu-
ate the potential of this general therapeutic strategy.

Preclinical data supporting the simultaneous targeting of the Raf-MEK-
ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathways in KRAS mutant cancers
(44) are currently being translated clinically. Although this approach may
enhance tumor killing, our data suggest that suppression of cytokine sig-
naling in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells will emerge as a
clinically relevant adverse effect of PI3K inhibition. This potential toxicity
may become especially problematic when PI3K inhibitors are used in

combination with other anticancer drugs that suppress blood cell produc-
tion. If this proves true, Akt or mTOR inhibitors may have a better ther-
apeutic index in certain clinical settings.

Finally, because some primary cells that have amounts of oncogenic
Ras similar to that of wild-type Ras remain dependent on extracellular
stimuli to activate downstream effector pathways, inhibitors of proteins
upstream of Ras may be effective in some cancers. For example, PLC-g and
PI3K are attractive therapeutic targets in JMML, CMML, and other MPNs
that have a high incidence of RAS mutations in which hematopoietic growth
factors play a central role in driving aberrant growth (9). This general para-
digm may also apply to nonhematologic cancers that remain dependent on
growth factors and other extracellular stimuli that contribute to activate
oncogenic signaling pathways.

published rules (57). The sequences of the PLC-g hairpins used to generate
the data shown in Fig. 2A and fig. S6 are provided in table S1.

Mice
KrasLSL-G12D mice were described previously (58). Mx1-Cre, KrasLSL-G12D
mice (10) received a single 250-mg injection of polyinosinic-polycytidilic
acid [poly(I:C), Sigma] at 21 days of age to induce KrasG12D expression.
All animals were maintained in the rodent barrier facility at the University
of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the UCSF Committee on Animal
Research approved the experimental procedures.

Harvesting and stimulation of bone marrow cells
Bone marrow cells were harvested from mouse femurs into Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
Sigma-Aldrich). Erythrocytes were lysed and mononuclear cells were incubated
at 37°C for 2 to 2.5 hours. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with the
following murine cytokines (all purchased from PeproTech) at the indicated
concentrations: GM-CSF (10 or 1 ng/ml), SCF (100 ng/ml), and M-CSF
(10 ng/ml). PMA and bryostatin were used at concentrations of 200 ng/ml
and 500 nM, respectively. For in vitro experiments, bone marrow cells were
harvested as described earlier, starved of cytokines and serum for 90 min,
and incubated for 30 min with each inhibitor before being stimulated with
GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) or SCF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min (for primary bone
marrow cells) or 15 min (for cultured BMMPCs).

Flow cytometric analysis and myeloid progenitor
cell proliferation
For flow cytometry, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and analyzed as described
previously, with staining of Sca1 and CD48 after formaldehyde fixation and
before methanol permeabilization (15, 21) {REF: Lyubynska}. CFU-GM col-
onies were grown from bone marrow cells in methylcellulose medium M3231
(STEMCELL Technologies) and scored at day 8 by indirect microscopy.

Culture and stimulation of BMMPCs
BMMPCs were grown in macrophage medium as described previously
(29, 59). After reaching confluence, the cells were passaged once and
grown for an additional 2 to 3 days. Before being stimulated, BMMPC
culture medium was replaced with minimal medium (IMDM supplemen-
ted with 1% BSA) for 4 hours. Next, supernatants were removed, 3 ml of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–based dissociation buffer (Gibco) was added,
and the plates were placed at 37°C for 5 min. Cells were then gently
scrapped off the plates with a rubber scrapper, washed once with PBS,
and resuspended in IMDM, 1% BSA for stimulation.

Western blotting analysis and Ras-GTP assays
After stimulation, cells were pelleted and lysed in 1% NP-40 buffer
containing 30 mM NaF, 30 mM b-glycerophosphate, 20 mM Na4P2O7,
1 mM Na3VO4, aprotinin (10 mg/ml), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined
with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Samples were resolved on precast
Criterion polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore). After incubation with the appropriate antibodies
and washing, the blots were treated with ECL (Amersham Biosciences)
or ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) to visualize target proteins. Ras-GTP abun-
dance was measured with a Raf-Ras binding domain (RBD) pull-down
assay, as described previously (59, 60).

Analysis of the effects of PLX4720 on ERK activation
BMMPCs were starved of serum and cytokines overnight, resuspended in
IMDM, 1% BSA medium, incubated with 5 mM PI-90 or 5 mM U73122
for 30 min, and then stimulated with GM-CSF in the absence or presence
of 5 mM PLX4720 for 15 min. Cells were then lysed and subjected to West-
ern blotting analysis to determine ERK activation.

Analysis of RasGRP expression by quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After quantifying the RNA with a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer, we performed RT-PCR assays with standard proce-
dures and random primers (Invitrogen). Real-time (TaqMan) RT-PCR
analysis was performed with an ABI TaqMan 7300 (Applied Biosystems)
with specific TAMRA (tetramethylrhodamine)–labeled probes. All steps
were performed in AmpliTaq Gold Mix (Applied Biosystems). During
the exponential phase of the PCR, the crossing threshold (Ct) was de-
termined for each amplification curve. DNAs from cells not stimulated
were used as calibrators. All results were normalized to those of the gene
encoding b-actin and were expressed as ratios related to the expression of
the gene of interest in the calibrator. The relative quantification ratio was
evaluated with quantification based on the DDCt method (51). RasGRP1-
specific primers and probe (Operon) were designed as follows: forward,
aagctccaccaactacagaact; reverse, agggagatgaggtccttgagat; probe, [6-FAM]
ccacatgaaatcaataaggttctcggtgag[TAMRA-6-FAM]. Expression of the
genes encoding b-actin and RasGRP3, and RasGRP4, was determined
with the following primer-probe sets purchased from Applied Biosystems:
Mm01205647_g1(b-actin),Mm01233143_m1(RasGRP3),andMm00460898_m1
(RasGRP4).

RasGRP knockdown by RNAi
For RNAi experiments, BMMPCs (1 × 106) were replated in 60 × 15–mm
petri dishes (BD Biosciences, #351007) in 4 ml of macrophage culture
medium containing M-CSF 1 day before the experiment. After 24 hours,
the medium was aspirated and replaced with 2.5 ml of IMDM, 1% BSA.
After 3 hours, a mixture containing 5 to 20 pmol (0.75 to 3 ml) of each
siRNA duplex together with 12 ml of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX solution
suspended in 500 ml of IMDM, 1% BSA was added to each plate. Cells
were mixed gently and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 before
serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. After 36 hours, cells were
harvested with cell dissociation buffer as described earlier, resuspended in
1 ml of IMDM, 1% BSA medium, and transferred to microfuge tubes for
stimulation with GM-CSF for 15 min. Cells were then spun down at 1130g,
lysed, and subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfer, and
Western blotting analysis as described earlier.

Retrovirus production and knockdown of PLC-g1
and PLC-g2 by shRNA
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected with the
calcium phosphate transfection protocol as described previously (7) to pro-
duce retrovirus containing LMN vectors (61) expressing both GFP and
shRNA constructs specific for PLC-g1 or both mCherry and shRNA con-
structs specific for PLC-g2. Cells were cultured for 72 hours to produce a
high viral titer, and the supernatant was collected. Bone marrow cells from
wild-type mice were then freshly harvested in IMDM, 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and spin-infected with the virus supernatant at 1000g for
2 hours at room temperature on six-well plates containing 4 × 106 cells
per construct. After spin infection, cells were incubated for 5 hours at
37°C and were then transferred to 15-ml tubes. After centrifugation at
1300 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh
macrophage culture medium [IMDM, 20% bovine growth serum, con-
taining M-CSF (30 ng/ml)], and the cells were plated again in six-well
plates and cultured for 24 hours. The next day, more viruses were col-
lected, and the spin infection protocol was repeated. After changing the
culture medium, cells were grown for 5 days until macrophages were gen-
erated. G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the cells for 5 days to select the
transduced cells. G418-containing medium was replaced by macrophage
medium containing M-CSF (30 ng/ml), and cells were cultured for an

additional 7 to 8 days until the macrophages reached 80% confluency.
Cells were then cultured in starving medium (IMDM, 1% BSA) over-
night and then were collected before being stimulated with GM-CSF
(10 ng/ml) for 15 min and then pelleted for Western blotting analysis,
as described earlier.

Target Upstream of Oncogenic Ras

G12D

G12D

Members of the K-Ras family of small guanosine triphosphatases mediate signaling by cytokine and growth factor

receptors to activate extracellular signal
molecules, for example, K-Ras
flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated proteins in mouse bone marrow cells, Diaz-Flores 
activation downstream of K-Ras
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Treatment of mice with a clinically available PI3K inhibitor reduced ERK 
G12D
activation in cells expressing K-Ras
therapeutic targets against some cancers.
