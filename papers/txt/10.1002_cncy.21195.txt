The Cytopathology of Malignant Peripheral Nerve

Sheath Tumor

A Report of 55 Fine-Needle Aspiration Cases

Paul E. Wakely, Jr, MD1; Syed Z. Ali, MD2; and Justin A. Bishop, MD2

BACKGROUND: Among sarcomas, a diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is often one of exclu-
sion due to the absence of unequivocally characteristic histopathology, a conclusive immunohistochemical profile, or even

a unique chromosomal anomaly. Because of this, the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytopathology of MPNST is extremely
challenging. In the current study, the authors review their FNA experience with this neoplasm. METHODS: The authors
searched their combined departmental cytology files for all lesions signed out as MPNST or suspicious for MPNST, as well

as their own surgical pathology files for any cases of MPNST that had corresponding cytology. FNA was performed using
standard techniques. RESULTS: A total of 55 cases of MPNST, all with tissue confirmation, and 1 misdiagnosed example of
melanoma were retrieved from 52 patients (M:F ratio of 1.5:1; average age, 46 years), 26 of whom had a history of neurofi-

bromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Aspirates were from primary (27 cases), locally recurrent (14 cases), or metastatic (10 cases)

MPNST; 4 primary tumor aspirates were of ex vivo specimens. Sites included the extremities (22 cases), trunk/pelvis (22

cases), head and neck (6 cases), and deep-seated masses (6 cases). FNA diagnoses were MPNST (24 patients); consistent

with MPNST (5 patients); sarcoma, not otherwise specified (10 patients); atypical (3 patients); spindle cell neoplasm (6

patients); malignant neoplasm (1 patient); and nondiagnostic (3 patients). A definitive diagnosis of either MPNST or con-

sistent with MPNST was issued in 30%, 93%, and 70%, respectively, of primary, locally recurrent, and metastatic lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: FNA cytopathology is limited as a diagnostic instrument for the initial diagnosis of MPNST, but is exceed-
ingly accurate and valuable in the recognition of metastatic and locally recurrent MPNST. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol)

INTRODUCTION

As defined in the latest World Health Organization classification, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
(MPNST) is one of the few sarcomas in which the clinicoradiologic knowledge is nearly as important as
any histopathologic feature. This classification states that MPNST is defined as a sarcoma that either arises
from a peripheral nerve; a preexisting benign nerve sheath neoplasm; demonstrates nerve sheath differen-
tiation in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1; von Recklinghausen disease); or exhibits the his-
topathology, immunohistology, or ultrastructural features of Schwann cell or perineural differentiation in
a non-NF-1 patient.1,2 These sarcomas are among the least common mesenchymal malignancies, and

slightly greater than one-half of all cases arise in indi-
viduals with NF-1. NF-1 associated neoplasms develop
approximately 10 years earlier than sporadic examples
of MPNST.

Among patients with sarcoma, a diagnosis of
MPNST is elusive, and absent the clinical criteria alluded
to previously is often one of exclusion due to the lack of a
universally distinctive histopathology, a conclusive immu-
nohistochemical profile, or even a unique chromosomal
anomaly. Because of its rarity, diagnostically demanding
nature, and limited exposure in the cytology literature, we
sought to review our fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
experience (and attendant pitfalls) with this neoplasm in
what to our knowledge is the largest series collected to date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Case Selection

We reviewed our cytology files from the past 16 years in
search of all cases signed out as MPNST or malignant
schwannoma. Surgical pathology files also were searched
for any examples of MPNST with a prior FNA to capture
any false-negative cases.

Technique

Percutaneous FNA biopsy was performed using a stand-
ard technique with 21-gauge or 22-gauge needles. Three
to 4 passes were made into a lesion, and each pass was
rinsed in a balanced salt solution after expelling cell mate-
rial onto glass slides for the creation of conventionally
made direct smears. Slides were stained using both Papa-
nicolaou and Romanowsky stains. Formalin-fixed, paraf-
fin-embedded cell block sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin.

Immunohistology performed from cell block mate-
rial used antibodies to epithelial membrane antigen
(EMA), vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophy-
sin, muscle-specific actin, desmin, S-100 protein, myoge-
nin, CD117, CD45, and cytokeratin AE1/3 in an
inconsistent fashion. Antibody use was predicated on the
amount of material in the cell block, if any, and diagnostic
considerations at the time.

RESULTS

We recovered 55 cases of MPNST and 1 case of amela-
notic malignant melanoma
erroneously

that was

diagnosed as epithelioid MPNST from 52 patients.
Patients ranged in age from 9 years to 92 years (average
age, 46 years) with a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. One-half
of the patients (26 of 52 patients) had NF-1. There were
no examples of postradiation MPNST. FNA samples
were obtained from primary soft tissue neoplasms (32
cases), locally recurrent neoplasms (14 cases), or meta-
static deposits (10 cases). Four of the primary FNA speci-
mens were obtained from ex vivo specimens (Table 1).
The extremities were the most common site for FNA
biopsy (22 cases), followed by the trunk/pelvis (22 cases),
head and neck (6 cases), and other deep-seated masses
(6 cases). Twenty-nine FNA samples were diagnosed cate-
gorically as MPNST (24 cases) or consistent with
MPNST (5 cases). One example (case 14) erroneously
diagnosed as epithelioid MPNST was found to be amela-
notic malignant melanoma. The remaining cytologic
diagnoses were sarcoma, not otherwise specified (10 cases);
atypical cells (3 cases); spindle cell neoplasm (6 cases);
malignant neoplasm (1 case); and nondiagnostic (3 cases).
A categorical diagnosis of either MPNST or consistent
with MPNST (excluding 4 ex vivo aspirates and 1 incor-
rect diagnosis) was issued in 28 of 51 cases (55%). When
the cases were subdivided further, only 8 of 27 (30%) but
13 of 14 (93%) and 7 of 10 (70%) aspirates of primary,
locally recurrent, and metastatic lesions, respectively, were
diagnosed specifically. Of 14 patients with NF-1 who had
an FNA biopsy performed on their primary neoplasm,
50% (7 patients) had a diagnosis of MPNST or consistent
with MPNST made; 4 of these individuals did not dem-
onstrate evidence on smears that was sufficient for even a
diagnosis of sarcoma.

Cytologic features were similar in all but 4 FNA
specimens. The majority of smears were highly cellular, but
this was somewhat variable because in a minority of FNAs
either fibrosis within the sarcoma precluded aspirating large
numbers of cells in some or abundant blood aspirated with
neoplastic cells in others had a dilutional effect. Cell
arrangement was comprised of numerous single dissociated
cells, and syncytial cell clusters of uneven size and cellularity
in nearly every case. Many clusters were sufficiently hyper-
cellular to produce a 3-dimensional effect leading to the
inability to observe cells in the center of these aggregates. In
some cases, parallel cell polarity created a vague fascicular
arrangement within aggregates (Figs. 1A and 1B). Individ-
ual cell necrosis was inconspicuous in general, and large

foci of necrosis were apparent in only 2 cases. Smear back-
ground was mostly clean, but some aspirates contained
strips of collagen or fibrillar metachromatic-staining stroma
(Figs. 1C and 1D). The most common appearance of sin-
gly dispersed cells was uniformity of size and shape. Primar-
ily nuclei were oval, but were also elongated with smooth
contours and inconsistently tapered or blunt-ended. In
some cases, nuclei had a slight â€˜â€˜hookâ€™â€™ at 1 pole, producing
a so-called comma shape. Slender serpiginous waviness of
nuclear outlines, although present, was not universal, nor
was even the dominant shape except in a few FNA samples;
true nuclear palisades were absent. The cells had finely
granular, evenly dispersed nuclear chromatin with small
chromocenters; coarsely granular chromatin and macronu-
cleoli were rare findings (Figs. 2A-2C). Only a very small

glandular differentiation or contained foci of angiosar-
coma; however, 1 case demonstrated heterologous chon-
droid differentiation in the resection specimen and
another case exhibited rhabdomyoblastic differentiation
(ie, malignant triton tumor) (not sampled by FNA in
both cases). Four cases had smears populated almost
exclusively by cells with rounded nuclei. Two of these had

appearance of a malignant small round cell tumor (Fig.

variant of MPNST (case 7), whereas the others were con-
ventional MPNST with foci of rounded cells, and 1 was a
malignant melanoma mistaken for
an epithelioid
MPNST.

DISCUSSION

No standardized histologic criteria exist to distinguish
MPNST from a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma, not oth-
erwise specified. This is particularly so because > 90% of
MPNSTs exhibit a fascicular
spindled morphology.
Coupled with the absence of any consistent, peculiar
immunoprofile (with the exception of the rare epithelioid

variant) or karyotypic abnormality, the histologic or cyto-
logic diagnosis of primary MPNST becomes exceedingly
difficult.1,2 As noted in our large series, we were able to
recognize MPNST specifically in only approximately one-
third (30%) of new patients. Helpful histopathologic fea-
tures demonstrating tumor growth within nerve fascicles;
loose, somewhat myxoid, zones sharply alternating with
areas of dense cellularity; and whorled perivascular accen-
tuation of cells commonly seen in whole tissue sections3
become imperceptible in FNA smears.

The cytopathology literature regarding MPNST is
comprised largely of case reports or small series of 3 to 4
patients.4-6 In addition, many of these are reports of meta-
static tumor. To our knowledge, the largest cytologic col-
lection of MPNST cases prior to the current study is a

al, in which so-called wavy nuclei appeared in only 1 of 8
examples.8 Cellular anaplasia, another feature often com-
mented on by others as being common,4,7 was noted in
only a few of the cases in the current study. This discrep-
ancy is no doubt a reflection of the spectrum of differen-
tiation that one encounters in MPNST.

Because the majority of our cases were examples of
well-differentiated MPNST, we found that cell monotony
and the presence of large numbers of singly dissociated
cells combined with cell aggregates were the overwhelm-
ingly common morphologic features. This appearance
raised the differential diagnoses of other banal-appearing
spindle cell neoplasms, including monophasic synovial
sarcoma, malignant solitary fibrous tumor, well-differen-
tiated leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuber-
ans (if superficial), cellular schwannoma, and low-grade
dedifferentiated liposarcoma (if retroperitoneal). Each of
these entities can be distinguished from well-differenti-
ated MPNST if one obtains sufficient material for immu-
nohistochemistry and,
if needed, fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis.

The epithelioid variant of MPNST (EMPNST) is
exceedingly rare. In the current study, there were 4 cases
in which smears had the appearance of an epithelioid
malignancy: 2 examples of conventional spindle MPNST
with round cell foci, 1 a true EMPNST, and 1 a misdiag-
nosed amelanotic malignant melanoma. EMPNST is
foremost confused with amelanotic malignant melanoma,
which is a well-known pitfall that we encountered.9,10
Other less frequent diagnostic considerations include clear
cell sarcoma of soft parts, epithelioid sarcoma, and ana-
plastic carcinoma. Our melanoma example was errone-
ously diagnosed as EMPNST (case 14) based on a
combination of its deep location, uniformly epithelioid
morphology, and intense positive S-100 staining coupled
with negative staining of the tumor (from the cell block)
with HMB-45, EMA, CD31, pankeratin, and muscle-
specific actin. Nonetheless,
the
resected specimen demonstrated positive staining with S-
100, but also with melanoma markers HMB-45 and
Melan-A in whole-tissue sections. The reason for this dis-
crepancy is unclear. Retrospective review of this false-posi-
tive case demonstrated a subtle feature of melanoma that
included a high percentage of cells with mirror-image
binucleation. Our single example of EPMNST had no

report of 24 cases from 17 patients.7 Analysis of those data
indicated an ability to correctly recognize MPNST in
merely 17% of cases, and in only 1 of 13 primary tumors
(8%). A literature review by these same authors found
MPNST was accurately diagnosed in 32 of 79 specified
cases (40.5%), whereas 51.9% were diagnosed as another
type of sarcoma, 3.8% were classified as suspicious, and
3.8% represented false-negative diagnoses, but it is not
known what percentages were from new patients com-
pared with those with known MPNST.7 As in the current
series, the authors found no evidence of nuclear palisad-
ing, but described wavy nuclei in > 50% of their aspirates.
This is in contrast to our cytologic cases, in which nuclear
â€˜â€˜bucklingâ€™â€™ (a feature long associated with nerve sheath
differentiation) was inconsistent and in many cases a
minor feature. Our experience parallels that of Gupta et

recognition. Dodd et al reached a similar conclusion, stat-
ing that this neoplasm is difficult to classify using FNA.9

As demonstrated in this and prior

studies of
MPNST cytopathology, when one encounters a new
patient without a history of NF-1 or without knowledge
that the neoplasm is in proximity to, or appears to arise
from, a major nerve, a specific diagnosis is exceptionally
difficult. This is because the cytomorphologic overlap
with other sarcomas is too pronounced. The results of the
current study demonstrate that features espoused by
others (including elongated slender, wavy, or hook-
shaped nuclei; focally pronounced nuclear atypia; bizarre
giant cells; and fibrillary metachromic stroma) are â€˜â€˜soft
signsâ€™â€™ and are not categorically specific of an MPNST.
Because no cytologic feature or set of features appears to
be specific, a primary FNA-based diagnosis of MPNST
remains quite difficult. However, if one has preexisting
knowledge of the clinical situations in which MPNST
typically occurs, then a correct diagnosis is more likely.
Conversely, FNA cytology is highly accurate in recogniz-
ing metastatic and locally recurrent MPNST.
