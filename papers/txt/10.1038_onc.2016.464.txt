Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor-predisposition disorder due to germline mutations in the tumor suppressor
gene NF1. A virtually pathognomonic ﬁnding of NF1 is the plexiform neuroﬁbroma (PN), a benign, likely congenital tumor that
arises from bi-allelic inactivation of NF1. PN can undergo transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an
aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. To better understand the non-NF1 genetic contributions to PN pathogenesis, we performed whole-
exome sequencing, RNASeq proﬁling and genome-wide copy-number determination for 23 low-passage Schwann cell cultures
established from surgical PN material with matching germline DNA. All resected tumors were derived from routine debulking
surgeries. None of the tumors were considered at risk for malignant transformation at the time; for example, there was no pain or
rapid growth. Deep (~500X) NF1 exon sequencing was also conducted on tumor DNA. Non-NF1 somatic mutation veriﬁcation was
performed using the Ampliseq/IonTorrent platform. We identiﬁed 100% of the germline NF1 mutations and found somatic NF1
inactivation in 74% of the PN. One individual with three PNs had different NF1 somatic mutations in each tumor. The median
number of somatic mutations per sample, including NF1, was one (range 0–8). NF1 was the only gene that was recurrently
somatically inactivated in multiple tumors. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of transcriptome-wide tumor RNA sequencing identiﬁed
ﬁve signiﬁcant (FDRo0.01) and seven trending (0.01 ⩽ FDRo0.02) gene sets related to DNA replication, telomere maintenance
and elongation, cell cycle progression, signal transduction and cell proliferation. We found no recurrent non-NF1 locus copy-
number variation in PN. This is the ﬁrst multi-sample whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing study of NF1-associated
PN. Taken together with concurrent copy-number data, our comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the primacy of NF1 loss as the
driver of PN tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common (1/3,000), autosomal
dominant, fully penetrant neurocutaneous tumor-predisposition
disorder that is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor
gene NF1, located on chromosome 17q11.2.1 It is diagnosed using
well-established clinical criteria2 that emphasize speciﬁc hallmark
features including café-au-lait macules,
intertriginous freckling,
neuroﬁbromas, optic pathway gliomas, and speciﬁc bone dyspla-
sias. A virtually pathognomonic ﬁnding of NF1 is the plexiform
neuroﬁbroma (PN), an often-congenital neuroﬁbroma that affects
30% (when deﬁned clinically3)
to 56% (when identiﬁed by
imaging4) of people with the disorder. Malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas with
limited therapeutic options that frequently arise from PN. People
with NF1 have a lifetime risk of about 15% to develop MPNST.5,6
PNs arise from within spinal, cranial and peripheral nerves and
typically involve multiple nerve roots or the length of a single
nerve and may occur anywhere, although there is a predilection
for neck and trunk, at least in those patients enrolling in treatment

trials.7 The growth of PN tends to track with that of the individual,
tapering off in late adolescence, although in some patients the
growth rate is unpredictable and can be very disﬁguring,
especially early in childhood.8 Some PNs may not be diagnosed
until adulthood, and thus the timing of the origin is unknown.
Prognostication of PN growth for a speciﬁc patient is difﬁcult, and
no therapies, other than surgery, are effective, despite a number
of trials testing novel agents.9,10 Clinically,
in addition to their
contribution to MPNST pathogenesis, PNs are a signiﬁcant cause
of morbidity due to their propensity for local
invasion, bone
erosion, organ compression, chronic pain and untoward esthetics.
Histologically, PN are similar to solitary neuroﬁbromas and are
composed of myxoid stroma and a cellular component. The
cellular element is heterogeneous and complex and consists
primarily of S-100-positive Schwann cells (60–80%)11 but also
ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, perineurial cells, smooth muscle cells,
mast cells,
In
neuroﬁbromas, the Schwann cell
is the primary neoplastic cell
and is the only cell to harbor a ‘second hit’ in the NF1 gene.13,14

Although it is clear that NF1 nullizygosity in a subset of Schwann
cells is critical for PN development, we have limited or conﬂicting
understanding of the other genetic factors that contribute to PN
tumorigenesis. From family studies, we know that PN burden is
heritable15 and not associated with the type of germline NF1
mutation16 or wildtype NF1 allele.15 The noncoding RNA ANRIL has
been proposed as a modiﬁer of PN burden.17 MPNSTs, unlike PNs,
are complex, genetically rearranged tumors that harbor somatic
mutations or copy-number changes in TP53, CDKN2A/B, EGFR,
mTOR, ERBB2, KIT, HGF, MET, SUZ12 and PDGFRA.18–21 One
microarray study found the only recurrent somatic alteration in
PN were deletions of the CDKN2A/B-ANRIL locus at 9p21.3 in 6/22
tumors.17 Activation of the WNT signaling pathway may also be a
feature of PN and MPNST tumorigenesis.19 We are aware of only
one publication that exome-sequenced a single PN as part of its
malignant transformation to a MPNST.22

To better understand the non-NF1 genetic contributions to PN
pathogenesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing, RNASeq
proﬁling and copy-number determination for 23 low-passage
Schwann cell cultures established from surgical PN material.

RESULTS
Whole exome-sequencing (WES) of 23 NF1-associated PNs with
matching germline DNA resulted in high conﬁdence genotypes
(most probable genotype quality score410) in ~ 90% of target
nucleotides. The average depth of coverage was 55X and 63X for
germline and tumor DNA, respectively (Supplementary Table S1).

Identiﬁcation of germline and somatic mutations in NF1
In addition to WES, we performed deep sequencing (~500X) of the
coding part of NF1 in all PNs on the IonTorrent platform. We
identiﬁed germline NF1 mutations in 100% of the 23 samples

(Figure 1, Supplementary Table S2A). Note that two of the samples
were tumors from monozygous twins (PN23 and PN24) and three
samples were independent
tumors from the same patient
obtained at different times (PN25, PN26 and PN28), for a total of
21 independent NF1 germline mutations. Germline mutation type
in decreasing order of frequency were: frame-shifting indels (38%),
nonsense (33%), splice-site (14%), missense (10%) and a single
total gene deletion (5%; Table 1). All mutations except two were
truncating, affected splice-sites and/or were reported in HGMD as
pathogenic. Of the two exceptions, the missense mutation in
PN11 (exon21, c.2542G4T, G848W) results in substitution of
glycine, the smallest aliphatic amino acid, by tryptophan, a bulky
aromatic compound, likely leading to signiﬁcant modiﬁcation or
inactivation of the protein function. It is also not observed in the
ExAC reference of 61,000 exomes. The second exception was a
silent substitution in PN19 (exon31, c.4269G4A, p.K1423K). This
synonymous missense mutation is not observed in ExAC and
results in a cryptic splice site that results in an in-frame loss of
27 bp of coding sequence. Therefore we consider
the two
‘exceptions’ to also be pathogenic germline mutations.

We identiﬁed somatic NF1 mutations in 74% of the 23 tumors
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2B). There were 7 (30%) large
deletions, 6 (26%) nonsense and 2 (9%) frame-shifting variants. We
found two somatic NF1 missense mutations (R997K in PN9, and
G2481E in PN11) that appear pathogenic because they affect
conserved residues and are de novo hits in the NF1 gene with no
other apparent pathogenic somatic mutation. Both variants have
CADD scores 420 and thus are predicted to be in the top 1% of
deleteriousness.23 Neither of these somatic missense mutations
were previously reported in HGMD, COSMIC or ExAC. R997K in PN9
was detected by both WES and IonTorrent sequencing and
appears to be present in the majority of tumor cells, while G2481E
in PN11 was identiﬁed by IonTorrent only and is present only in a
small number of cells. Two tumors (PN21 and PN26) showed two

K1423K result in splicing defects and therefore depicted with black dots. The germline nonsense mutation R816X was found in two unrelated
individuals, and the germline frame-shifting mutation L2112fs was found in monozygotic twins and was counted for both individuals. Large
deletions are not shown on the diagram (for details see Supplementary Tables S2A and B).

somatic mutations each (a missense variant accompanied by
either a nonsense (PN21) or frameshifting (PN26) variant), that
were identiﬁed by IonTorrent deep sequencing but not WES.

All frame-shifting small

indels detected in germline and tumor
DNA were novel, whereas the majority of nonsense, and splice-site
point substitutions had been previously reported. Germline and
somatic missense mutations were both previously reported and
novel. Importantly, in the patient with the three different PN (PN25,
PN26, PN28), three different second hits in NF1 occurred, suggesting
a stochastic random deactivation of the normal copy of the gene, as
ﬁrst proposed by Colman et al.24

NF1 expression in PN and normal schwann cells
Compared with normal Schwann cells (100%), median NF1 expres-
sion in PN was 53% (range: 16–107%; Figure 2). Samples with lower
expression values of NF1 (lower half of samples in Figure 2a) had a
higher number of total/partial gene deletions (6 vs 1), as well as
frame-shifting indels (8 vs 5) and nonsense mutations (7 vs 5)
compared with the samples with higher expression values of the
gene. This observation is consistent with the previous ﬁndings that
nonsense and frame-shifting mutations may trigger some degree of
nonsense mediated decay of RNA molecules with multiple stop
codons. Interestingly, samples without second hits were found in the
upper half of the expression value distribution (Figure 2).

NF1 as the sole driver in pathogenesis of plexiform neuroﬁbromas
Besides NF1, we identiﬁed 26 high-conﬁdence somatic mutations;
19 (73%) were non-synonymous and 15 (58%) were potentially
damaging (Table 2; Supplementary Table S3). Three of the 15

potentially damaging variants were in recognized cancer genes
(BRCA1, FGFR1 and RNF43). Three variants (FGFR1, RNF43 and
ELMOD3) have been observed a total of four times in The Cancer
Genome Atlas. None of the 26 non-NF1 somatic mutations have
been reported in other NF1-associated tumors, including lower-
grade glioma,25 soft-tissue sarcoma26 or glioblastoma27,28 sequen-
cing projects. NF1 was the only gene that was somatically mutated
in multiple samples. The lack of recurrent, deleterious mutations in
biologically plausible genes suggests that
these variants are
‘passengers’ and not primary drivers of plexiform neuroﬁbroma-
genesis. The distribution of these 15 non-NF1 putatively-damaging
somatic mutations among the 23 PN tumors is shown in Table 3;
only ﬁve tumors (22%) had potentially damaging somatic
mutations outside of the NF1 locus. The median number of
somatic mutations per sample (including mutations in NF1) was
one (range 0–8). Interestingly, only six out of these 15 genes were
expressed in the tumors or normal Schwann cells as determined
by RNAseq analysis, suggesting that only a minor proportion of
mutations could potentially play a role in tumor phenotype.

RNA sequencing-based PN transcriptome analysis reveals
perturbed expression of DNA replication, cell cycle and telomere
maintenance pathways
We analyzed expression of 11293 genes in PNs and cultured
normal (wild-type) Schwann cells with the Molecular Signature
Database and identiﬁed ﬁve signiﬁcantly-altered gene sets
(FDRo 0.01) and seven trending (0.01 ⩽ FDRo 0.02) sets in
the ‘Curated’,
‘Gene Ontology’ and ‘Oncogenic
Signatures’ collections (Supplementary Table S4; Figure 3).

Gene name, chromosomal location (hg19), reference and alternative alleles, type of mutation, frequency of variant allele in ExAC db, mutation deleteriousness
as predicted by PolyPhen, SIFT and CADD (mutation was considered damaging if it was classiﬁed as probably or possibly damaging by PolyPhen, OR
deleterious by SIFT, OR its CADD score was above 20), the status of the gene expression in PNs and normal Schwann cells as measured by total transcriptome
sequencing and sample and cell IDs are shown. Known cancer genes are shown in bold font.

Eight gene sets were up-regulated and four gene-sets were
down-regulated in PN compared with normal Schwann cells.
There were 300 genes in the 12 sets that contributed to the
enrichment score (the leading-edge genes), and 60 genes
were found in at least two different gene sets (Supplementary
Table S4). Plotting expression of these genes in tumors vs
normal Schwann cells revealed that 52 of
them found in
up-regulated sets were moderately overexpressed and eight
genes found in down-regulated sets were under-expressed in
tumors (Figure 4).

Copy-number analysis identiﬁes no recurrent non-NF1 copy
number variations
Remarkably, we did not identify a single signiﬁcant recurrent copy
number variation (CNV) outside of the NF1 locus by Nexus analysis.
We found copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting the
entire q-arm of chromosome 17 in a single tumor (PN27) by both
ASCAT and Nexus consistent with mitotic recombination; six
additional smaller partial or total NF1 deletions were identiﬁed with
the Nexus algorithm only (Supplementary Table S5). The size of the
deletions ranged from 66 kb (ten exons in the middle of the NF1
gene) to over 24 Mb (the entire 17q-arm). None of the somatic
deletions extended into the 17p arm, where TP53 resides, however,
in four tumors the deletion also comprised entire SUZ12, which is
frequently inactivated in MPNSTs.

DISCUSSION
This study is the ﬁrst multi-sample whole-exome and whole
transcriptome sequencing analysis of NF1-associated PN. Previous
work in PN has focused on their cell of origin and micro-
environment,29

development.30 One study of WES of PN, MPNST and associated
metastases samples collected from a single patient over 14 years
found a very limited number of mutations in the PN samples, none
of which overlapped with our ﬁndings. No copy-number changes
were detected in three PN samples from the single patient.22
Cytogenetic abnormalities have been identiﬁed more frequently
in cells derived from PN than from dermal neuroﬁbromas,
however no consistent chromosomal
regions with abnormal
karyotypes have been identiﬁed in PN.31 From this work, we
establish that the overall exome mutation rate in PN is very low
and comparable with pediatric malignancies. The somatic variants
(other than NF1) that were conﬁrmed on a second platform
appeared in one sample only and most were not predicted to be
signiﬁcantly pathogenic. Furthermore, the majority were found in
genes that were not expressed in the tumors or normal Schwann
cells. We found no recurrent copy-number variation in PN outside
the NF1 locus. Despite the low number of somatic mutations and
CNVs in PN, we observed that expression of 300 genes in several
key cellular processes, such as DNA replication initiation and
strand elongation, cell cycle progression and telomere main-
tenance and extension, was perturbed. Taken together, our
comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the primacy of NF1 loss
as the driver of plexiform neuroﬁbroma tumorigenesis.

We identiﬁed germline NF1 mutations in 100% of the samples
and a somatic NF1 ‘second hit’
in 74% of PN, a rate that is
comparable with previous studies.32 We deep-sequenced (500X)
all NF1 exons and intron-exon boundaries in the PN and therefore
it is unlikely that we missed any mutations or short indels in those
regions. We also carefully examined NF1 RNA transcripts from PN
for evidence of aberrantly spliced species, which may have
suggested the presence of deep intronic mutations, but did not
ﬁnd any (data not shown). We acknowledge that the SNP arrays
we used have limited resolution and would likely fail to detect

medium-sized (100–1000 bp) deletions; however, such deletions
are also difﬁcult to identify by NGS approaches. Furthermore,
samples with undetected second hits had relatively high levels of
NF1 expression, suggesting that these samples contain a relatively
smaller ratio of tumor cells. We posit that the samples with
undetected second hits harbor deep intronic and/or medium-
sized deletions and occur in PNs with a relatively low proportion
of NF1− / − Schwann cells. The spectrum and distribution of NF1
LOH events and discrete mutations in PN from our study was also
comparable with previous work.32 Independent somatic mutations
in NF1 have been reported in individuals with two PN.33 We found
non-NF1 somatic mutations at a very low frequency (Tables 2 and 3),
as predicted for a congenital tumor such as a PN. Given the low
mutation rate, we cast a broad net to identify somatic variants but
applied a rigorous ﬁltering (overlap) scheme to reduce the
number of false positives. We acknowledge that our ﬁltering
strategy might increase the false-negative rate and we acknowl-
edge that the modest number of samples limits the power.

variants are not pathogenic, as predicted by a variety of
bioinformatics methods, and do not reside in known cancer

BRCA1, FGFR1 and RNF43 (known cancer genes) from two tumors
(Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3) were present in the COSMIC
database. The rs80356892 missense variant
in BRCA1 was
heterozygous in the germline that became homozygous in the
PN due to a large deletion on chromosome 17, which also affected
the NF1 locus. BRCA1 was modestly expressed in the tumor
(Supplementary Table S3). The variant was originally identiﬁed in a
Japanese patient who developed a breast cancer at age of 54
years,34 however subsequent multi-center ClinVar review has
deemed it benign (ClinVar variant ID # 54604). The NF1 patient
harboring this variant has not developed any tumors other than a
PN, however she is only in her mid-20s; the histopathology of her

Figure 4.
Expression of 60 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis leading-edge genes in PN and normal Schwann cells. Expression values of genes that
were found in at least two signiﬁcant sets are shown. Blue bars represent normal Schwann cells, and red bars represent PN. Fifty-two genes
(POLA2 through XRCC6) are up-regulated and eight genes (DTX2 through TMEM8B) are down-regulated in PN compared with normal Schwann
cells (SC). Note that raw median expression value of KRT16 in PN is 0.51, which results in negative value of − 0.97, when log2 transformed.

PN was unremarkable. The missense variant in RNF43 in tumor
PN9 was predicted to be deleterious, however the gene was not
expressed in PNs and the variant likely had no effect on the tumor
phenotype. The missense FGFR1 variant in tumor PN9 (P772S) was
present in parity with its reference allele (Supplementary Table
S3), suggesting that it was acquired by the cell soon after the
somatic NF1 hit (Ref/Alt counts = 1039/956, Supplementary Table
S2B). The gene was modestly expressed in the tumor and the
mutant allele was expressed at the same rate as the reference one
(Supplementary Table S3). FGFR1 is a tyrosine-protein kinase that
plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic develop-
ment, cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. It mediates
activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP-kinase
signaling pathway, as well as the AKT1 signaling pathway.
Although FGFR1 P772S was reported to be associated with
Kallmann syndrome in an earlier paper,35 its high prevalence in
the ExAC database argues (3.83 × 10− 3) against pathogenicity. The
PN9 tumor had a relatively loose extra cellular matrix, but was
otherwise unremarkable.

compared primary tissue and primary cell cultures of PN, dermal
neuroﬁbroma, and MPNSTs with wild-type Schwann cells using
gene expression arrays. They found 2827 distinct
transcripts
in 1952 unique genes differentially expressed among these
groups of samples; dermal neuroﬁbroma and PN did not differ
signiﬁcantly from each other. Unlike previous studies that
utilized a microarray approach, we used whole-transcriptome
RNA-sequencing data to determine differential expression in PN vs
normal Schwann cells. In addition, we used Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis, an established analytical method that derives its power
by focusing on sets of genes, grouped by their function and
biology, rather than employing a single-gene approach, known for

having a number of limitations. We found ﬁve highly statistically
signiﬁcant (FDRo0.01) and seven trending (0.01 ⩽ FDRo0.02)
gene sets with known roles in DNA replication, cell proliferation,
cell cycle control and telomere maintenance. One of the best-
studied consequences of NF1 inactivation is RAS-mediated hyper-
activation of the Ras-MAPK and AKT1-PI3K pathways, which play
key roles in cell proliferation and differentiation.39 The functional
connection between NF1 inactivation and telomere maintenance
and elongation and is less studied, however it may provide
insights
immortalization and genomic
instability in the tumors. Comparison of the leading-edge set of
300 genes with the set of 1952 differentially expressed genes from
Miller et al.38 revealed an overlap of 36 genes with a p-value
of 0.021.

into mechanisms of

The majority of published investigations on CNV differences in
NF1-associated tumors (with paired germline DNA) have been
performed on MPNSTs. The few studies that have investigated PNs
found a paucity of such changes and a lack of speciﬁc recurrent
CNVs. Upadhyaya et al.
is a typical example and studied CNVs
using the Affymetrix Array 6.0 chip and found 996 copy
differences in 15 MPNSTs and 26 copy differences in 5 PNs (both
paired analyses); 17 of these changes were in a single sample.40
The ratio of gains to losses was 24/2. Except for one overlap on
chromosome 4 in two patients, there were no recurring or
overlapping CNVs.40 In our study, we did not ﬁnd any recurrent
CNVs outside the NF1 locus. We noticed that
the majority
of large somatic deletions on 17q comprising the NF1 locus
also contained the entire SUZ12 gene. Currently it’s unclear
if hemizygous deletion of SUZ12 confers any advantage in
PN-MPNST transformation.

The limited clinical information available on the PNs is included
in the Supplementary Clinical Information ﬁle. We emphasize that
all tumors in this study were asymptomatic and procured from
routine debulking surgeries. They were classiﬁed as neuroﬁbromas
and were not suspected as pre-malignant or malignant lesions; for

example, the tumors were not associated with pain or increased
growth. Atypical neuroﬁbroma (ANF) and MPNST often arise
within pre-existing PNs18 and it is difﬁcult to detect these tumors
clinically in the early stages. In rare instances, a PN tissue could be
intermixed with ANF or MPNST, and when cultured pre-malignant
or malignant cells could potentially outgrow the benign ones,
however we expect that such scenarios would be relatively
infrequent and therefore the effect of such tissue heterogeneity
on the results would be limited.

In summary, our data show that initiation of NF1-associated PN,
a benign, slowly growing tumor, is driven by somatic inactivation
of NF1. We observed three independent somatic NF1 mutations in
three PN from the same individual, consistent with a clonal origin.
Plexiform neuroﬁbromas harbor a near-zero mutation burden
outside of the NF1 locus, and the genomic architecture of the
tumors closely resembles that of a normal diploid cell. It appears
that inactivation of NF1 is sufﬁcient for PN initiation. A series of
additional mutations is likely required for subsequent malignant
transformation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples were collected under the IRB-approved protocol (‘Genetic Studies
of Neuroﬁbromatosis 1’ 41–1992) and reviewed by the NIH Ofﬁce of
Human Subjects Research. Twenty-three fresh surgical specimens (2–10 g)
were obtained from 21 independent subjects (including one set of
identical twins) undergoing PN debulking for cosmetic or functional
reasons and not for concern about pain or rapid growth. All non-tumor-
appearing tissue was trimmed away; the remaining tissue was fresh frozen
and processed using standard methods for
formalin ﬁxing/parafﬁn
embedding, DNA extraction, total RNA extraction (Trizol, Invitrogen), and
dissociation into single cell suspension for Schwann-enriched culture.
Germline DNA was obtained from EDTA-blood samples, buccal swabs, or
from ﬁbroblast cultures derived from the tumor cultures.

Culture of schwann cells
Enriching and culturing of NF1 − / − Schwann cells from NF1-associated PN
and normal human Schwan cells was done as described previously.41
Cultures always contain at least some ﬁbroblasts, and the Schwann cell
component usually senesces by P8-P10, thus passages P4-P6 were used for
most studies. Three cultures of normal human Schwann cells purchased
from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA) were cultured the
same way. One sample, PN9, required whole-genome ampliﬁcation of both
somatic and germline DNA.

Whole exome sequencing of matching pairs of tumor and normal
DNA
Exome capture of genomic DNA and library preparation for next
generation sequencing was done by using Illumina TruSeq V1:32 and
TruSeq V2:30 kits (62 Mb), per the manufacturer’s instructions on 1 μg of
tumor and matching normal genomic DNA. The sequencing was done on
the Illumina HiSeq 2,500 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Of 44
exomes, the average breadth of coverage was 89% (range 84–92%); the
average depth of coverage was 59X (range 34–108X).

RNA extraction, Illumina whole transcriptome sequencing and
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
RNA extraction and Illumina RNA sequencing was done as described
previously.42 RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from 1 μg total RNA after
rRNA depletion using Ribo-Zero GOLD (Illumina). The Illumina TruSeq RNA
Sample Prep V2 Kit was used according to manufacturer’s instructions
except where noted. The data were processed using RTA v. 1.18.64 and
CASAVA v. 1.8.2. The data for 23 PN and two normal adult Schwann cells
samples were further processed using standard Tuxedo pipeline.43 The
resulting gene expression from transcriptome datasets were then log2
transformed and standardized (z-scored). Genes with the median log2
FPKM score below 0.5 in both groups (PN and normal Schwann cells) were
considered unexpressed and removed from the analysis. The resulting
expression set of 11 293 genes was analyzed with GSEA as described.44 We
used 5000 permutations and shufﬂed the expression dataset by gene-sets

rather than by sample labels. Gene-sets with FDRo0.01 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant and with 0.01 ⩽ FDRo0.02 as trending.

Copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity
CNV and LOH analyses were performed as described previously.45 SNP
genotyping was performed using HumanOmni2.5–8 BeadChip kits
(Illumina) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Non-NF1 somatic mutation veriﬁcation and deep NF1 mutation
detection by Ampliseq/IonTorrent
Multiplex PCR primers for somatic mutation veriﬁcation were designed
using the Ion Ampliseq Designer tool (v.3.0.1, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA). Multiplex PCR ampliﬁcation,
library preparation and
sequencing on the Ion Proton sequencer
(Life Technologies) were
performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Reads from the Ion
Torrent Proton sequencer were ﬁltered, and adapter- and quality-trimmed.
The resulting sequences were aligned to human reference genome hg19
using TMAP (Life Technologies). Resulting BAM ﬁles were further aligned
using The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, http://www.nature.com/ng/
journal/v43/n5/full/ng.806.html ). For missense and nonsense mutations,
NF1 cDNA was examined by reverse-transcription PCR (Superscript II,
Invitrogen) using primers ﬂanking the affected exon, followed by Sanger
sequencing (ABI Big Dye 3) to screen for splicing errors.

Whole exome sequencing analysis
The data were processed with two pipelines (‘NISC’ and ‘Broad’)
(Supplementary Figure S1A) and somatic mutations were identiﬁed by
subtracting germline variants. Alternatively, somatic variants were called
by MuTect46 (Broad pipeline; Supplementary Figure S1B). Potential
causative genes were analyzed with driver-passenger software.47 Select
somatic mutations were veriﬁed by using AmpliSeq and IonTorrent
sequencing of targeted PCR products. IonTorrent sequencing data were
compared with WES data; mutations identiﬁed by both technologies in the
same tumor samples were deemed ‘high-conﬁdence’ variants. Given the
importance of NF1 in the tumors, we included the entire coding part of the
gene into the AmpliSeq/IonTorrent validation effort. The NISC pipeline
included the following components: Novoalign, v.2.08.02 (Novocraft.com,
Selangor, Malaysia) for read alignment to hg19; duplicate removal with
samtools;48 bam2mpg for genotype calling and calculation of the quality
score most probable genotype49 and ANNOVAR for functional annotation
of genetic variants50 (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/). The
resulting data were formatted in VarSifter51 format (http://research.nhgri.
nih.gov/software/VarSifter/) for further ﬁltering. The ﬁltering was done as
follows. First, all non-coding variants and the nucleotides whose genotypes
were identical
in both tumor and corresponding normal DNA were
removed. Second,
from the remaining coding somatic variants all
sequence variants that had a quality score (most probable genotype)
o10 either in tumor or normal DNA were removed.

(https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
removing duplicates; The
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.2.4–953 for local realignment and base
quality recalibration; and GATK UniﬁedGenotyper (https://software.broad
institute.org/gatk/) for calling point mutations and insertions-deletions.
ANNOVAR was used for
functional annotation of genetic variants.
Additional ﬁltering used custom Perl scripts to remove all non-coding,
low quality (scoreo200) and common variants (1,000 Genomes and NHLBI
Exome Sequencing Project variant frequency40.01) as well as variants
with alternative allele frequency below 0.3. In addition, MuTect46 was used
to compare tumor with matched normal DNA and identify somatic point
mutations.

In both pipelines, variants of interest were referenced against the Human
Gene Mutation Database (HGMD: www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk), Exome Aggregation
Consortium (ExAC: http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), and the Catalog of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer, (COSMIC: http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).

Passenger/driver analysis
We used the Youn and Simon (‘NCI_DPS’) software developed at NCI47
or MutSigCV (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutsig). The NCI
software was used with both the NISC and Broad pipelines whereas MutSig
was used only with the Broad pipeline. To prepare data for MutSigCV,
predicted somatic mutations from the 23 PN were ﬁrst converted to MAF

format using the UCSC ‘known gene’ annotations,54 assigning an effect
value of ‘nonsilent’ if a mutation altered the protein sequence for any of
the annotated transcripts of a gene, ‘silent’ if the mutation resided within
the coding sequence of a gene, and ‘ﬂank’ if otherwise. Gene coverage,
broken down by effect value, was evaluated similarly, making the
assumption that a genomic position was ‘covered’ if both the tumor and
the normal sample had adequate sequencing depth to genotype both
samples with an most probable genotype score of 10 or greater.49 For
gene mutability covariate values, we used expression, replication time, and
reported previously.55 Coverage, MAF, and
chromatin state values
covariate ﬁles were then used as input to MutSigCV version 1.3.0156 via
the Broad Institute's GenePattern server.57

Allele-speciﬁc copy number and LOH analysis of PN
Paired CNV and LOH analysis of tumor and matching normal DNA was
performed by using Nexus v.6.1 software (BioDiscovery Inc., Hawthorne,
CA, USA) as described previously.45 The analysis settings were selected
based on the developer’s suggestions for the analysis of tumor samples.
‘Allele-Speciﬁc Copy number Analysis of Tumors’ (ASCAT v.2.1) analysis was
performed as previously described.58
