Abstract

The goal of this study was to investigate the activity of the
selective MEK1/2 inhibitor TAK-733 in both melanoma cell
lines and patient-derived melanoma xenograft models. In vitro
cell proliferation assays using the sulforhodamine B assay were
conducted to determine TAK-733 potency and melanoma
responsiveness. In vivo murine modeling with eleven patient-
derived melanoma explants evaluated daily dosing of TAK-733 at
25 or 10 mg/kg. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate on-
target activity and downstream inhibition by TAK-733 in both
in vitro and in vivo studies. TAK-733 demonstrated broad activity
in most melanoma cell lines with relative resistance observed at
IC50 > 0.1 mmol/L in vitro. TAK-733 also exhibited activity in 10
out of 11 patient-derived explants with tumor growth inhibition
ranging from 0% to 100% (P < 0.001–0.03). Interestingly,

BRAFV600E and NRAS mutational status did not correlate with
responsiveness to TAK-733. Pharmacodynamically, pERK was
suppressed in sensitive cell lines and tumor explants, conﬁrming
TAK-733–mediated inhibition of MEK1/2, although the dem-
onstration of similar effects in the relatively resistant cell lines
and tumor explants suggests that escape pathways are contrib-
uting to melanoma survival and proliferation. These data dem-
onstrate that TAK-733 exhibits robust tumor growth inhibition
and regression against human melanoma cell lines and patient-
derived xenograft models, suggesting that further clinical devel-
opment in melanoma is of scientiﬁc interest. Particularly inter-
esting is the activity in BRAF wild-type models, where current
approved therapy such as vemurafenib has been reported not to
be active. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(2); 317–25. Ó2014 AACR.

Introduction

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and is
characterized by poor survival outcomes and limited thera-
peutic options. An estimated 123,590 new cases of melanoma
were diagnosed in the United States in 2011, with a 5-year
survival rate of advanced-stage melanoma of 15% (1). The
MAPK pathways are signaling networks that transfer growth
factor signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus through
protein kinase cascades. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is
one of the best-characterized MAPK pathways and serves to
transmit extracellular signals that ultimately regulate cellular

proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell-cycle, angiogene-
sis, and survival (2–5). In many malignancies, including mel-
anoma, the MAPK pathway has been shown to be upregulated,
either through overexpression of extracellular growth factor
ligands or by constitutive activation through mutations in RAS
or RAF (2, 3, 6, 7). With the upregulation of this pathway, a
malignant phenotype can emerge, characterized by hyperpro-
liferation of tumor cells, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced
invasion and migration (4, 7, 8). Activating mutations in BRAF
have been found in approximately 60% of primary melanoma
tumors (6, 9). The most common BRAF mutation is the V600E
valine to glutamic acid substitution at codon 600. This muta-
tion leads to dysregulation and constitutive activation of
the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in abnormal cell growth
and ultimately malignant
transformation (4, 6–8, 10).
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that many of these
tumors harboring the V600E mutation are dependent on the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway for survival and proliferation
(11–14). MEK is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the
BRAF downstream signaling cascade and is responsible for the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, ERK1/2 appears to
be the sole targets of MEK, making MEK an interesting target
for anticancer therapeutics (15–18).

The development of BRAF inhibitors has provided a new
treatment option for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Unfortunately,
despite an impressive initial response, many patients have
relapsed on BRAF inhibitor therapy. Posttreatment biopsies
of resistant tumors have identiﬁed RTK, NRAS, COT, and

C-RAF–mediated activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, essen-
tially bypassing BRAF altogether (19–23). The ultimate result of
MAPK pathway activation by any of the above mechanisms is
MEK protein kinase activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
with subsequent nuclear translocation and gene transcription,
resulting in a proliferative and antiapoptotic, BRAF-inhibitor–
resistant phenotype.

TAK-733 (Takeda California) is an investigational potent,
selective, non-ATP–competitive allosteric inhibitor of MEK
kinase (24, 25). In in vitro assays, TAK-733 inhibits MEK kinase
selectively, and potently inhibits growth in a broad range of cell
lines (24, 25). In mouse xenograft efﬁcacy studies, TAK-733 has
demonstrated substantial
tumor growth suppression and
shrinkage in a wide range of tumor types (24). As MEK inhi-
bitors act downstream of BRAF, resistance to BRAF inhibitors
via activation of C-RAF, COT, or N-RAS in melanoma would be
blocked and tumor growth would theoretically be slowed or
suppressed altogether.
Indeed, MEK inhibitors have been
shown to provide increased survival beneﬁt in patients with
BRAF or N-RAS–mutant melanoma both as a single agent or in
combination with BRAF inhibition in initial clinical trials
(11, 13, 26–30). In this study, in vitro and in vivo characteri-
zation of TAK-733 was carried out in preclinical models of
malignant melanoma, including pharmacodynamic analyses.
In addition, the antitumor activity of TAK-733 was assessed
using patient-derived human tumor explant (PDTX) melanoma
xenograft models. Finally, acquired resistance to TAK-733
was induced in a PDTX model by chronic administration of
TAK-733. Gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment
analyses were performed to identify potential mechanisms of
resistance to this inhibitor in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell lines

TAK-733 (Supplementary Fig. S1) was provided by Takeda
Cambridge US, Inc. under a materials transfer agreement and
prepared as a 10-mmol/L stock solution in DMSO. For in vivo
studies, this compound was prepared as a suspension in 0.5%
methylcellulose in sterile water by brief vortexing followed by
sonication for 10 minutes. The cutaneous melanoma cell lines
were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured according to
their recommendations. All cell lines except SK-MEL24 and
Hs852t were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invi-

trogen), and were maintained at 37
C under an atmosphere of
95% O2, 5% CO2. SK-MEL 24 required 15% FBS and Hs852t
required a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Authenticity of all cell lines was
veriﬁed by the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA
Sequencing (Aurora, CO) and Analysis Core using the Proﬁler
Plus Kit (Applied Biosystems). The data obtained were compared
with ATCC data to ensure that the cell line proﬁles had not
changed with the latest proﬁling performed in January and
February 2013.

Cell proliferation assays

The effects of TAK-733 on cell proliferation were determined
using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) method (31). Brieﬂy, cells in
logarithmic growth phase were transferred to 96-well ﬂat bottom
plates with lids. Of note, 100 mL cell suspensions containing 2,000
to 3,000 viable cells were plated into each well and incubated



overnight before exposure with increasing concentrations of
TAK-733 for 72 hours. Postdrug administration, media were
removed and cells were ﬁxed with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid
for 30 minutes at 4
C. Cells were then washed with water and
stained with 0.4% SRB (Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 30 minutes at room
temperature, washed again with 1% acetic acid, followed by stain
solubilization with 10 mmol/L tris at room temperature. The
absorbance at 565 nm was measured on a plate reader (Biotek
Synergy 2). Cell proliferation curves were derived from the raw
absorbance (OD) data. Statistical analyses and graphical repre-
sentation of data were obtained using GraphPad Prism version
5.00 (GraphPad Software).

Immunoblotting

For in vitro studies, cell lines were seeded into 6-well plates
and allowed to grow in complete media without drug for 24
hours. Cells were then switched to FBS-free media for 24 hours.
On day 3, cells were exposed to DMSO or TAK-733 (0.125
mmol/L) in FBS-free media for one hour, with and without
addition of 10% FBS, was added to each well for 30 minutes.
The cells were then scraped into RIPA buffer containing protease
inhibitors, EDTA, sodium ﬂuoride (NaF), and sodium ortho-
vanadate. Total protein levels in samples were determined
using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micro-
grams of total protein were loaded onto a 8% to 12% gradient
gel, electrophoresed, and then transferred to PVDF using
the I-Blot system (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked
for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) with 5% nonfat dry milk
in TBS containing tween-20 (0.1%) before overnight incuba-
tion at 4
C with the following primary antibodies (clone):
Cell Signaling Technology; pAKT (D9E), AKT (40D4), pERK
(D13.14.4E), ERK (L34F12), pS6RP (D57.2.2E), S6RP (54D2),
pPI3K (poly), PI3K (19H8), pBAD (40A9), caspase-3 (8G10),
cleaved caspase-3 (5A1E), a-tubulin (DM1A), and b-actin
(13E5). After primary antibody, blots were washed three times
20 minutes in TBS-Tween (0.1%), incubated with the appro-
priate secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG infrared-linked
antibody at 1:20,000 for 1 hour at RT, washed three times, and
developed using the Licor Odyssey (Licor Inc).

PD and PK sample collection and handling

Mice bearing A375 human melanoma xenografts were dosed
by oral gavage. Animals were sacriﬁced using carbon dioxide at
various time points following administration Plasma was sepa-
rated and frozen on dry ice, then stored at  80
C before being
transferred for analysis. Subcutaneous tumors were removed from
mice and divided into two parts. Both halves of each tumor were
frozen on dry ice and stored at  80
C before determination of
compound concentration or analyzed for pERK pharmacody-

Efﬁcacy of TAK-733 in Melanoma

For PD assessment, excised tumors were homogenized in an
SDS-based lysis buffer using a BeadBeater (BioSpec Products).

Lysates were spun at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4
C. Of note,
700 mL was transferred to new tubes and spun at 12,000 rpm for

10 minutes at 4
C. Supernatants were transferred to 96-deepwell
blocks, and protein concentrations were determined using a
microBCA Assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Each sample was nor-
malized to 3.0 mg/mL of total protein in 62.4 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% glycerol, 10% and 2% bromophenyl blue
solution. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using
NuPage Bis-Tris gels (4%–12%) using 2-(N-morpholine) etha-
nesulfonic acid buffer, and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuor-
ide membranes (Millipore). Anti-pERK-1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and
anti-total ERK-1/2 rabbit polyclonal (Cell Signaling Technology)

were incubated overnight at 4
C to detect pERK-1/2 and anti-total
ERK-1/2 proteins in the A375 xenograft model. Images of blots
were collected on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor
Biosciences) and signals corresponding to pERK and total ERK
were quantiﬁed using Li-Cor software.

Quantitation of TAK-733

Compound concentrations in plasma were determined after
precipitation of proteins in acetonitrile (Fisher Scientiﬁc). Tumor
samples were homogenized in 5 volumes of water (i.e., 1 g
tumor:4 mL water) using an Omni-prep homogenizer (Omni
International). Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at

3,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4
C in a bench top Beckman Coulter
Allegra 25R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). One hundred micro-
liters of supernatant were transferred to 1.5 mL 96-well plate
and dried down under a steady stream of nitrogen. Samples were
reconstituted with 300 mL of mobile phase (20:80 acetonitrile:
water). Processed plasma samples were loaded by a Leap CTC PAL
(Leap Technologies) autosampler onto a 2.5-mm Synergi Polar-RP
100A, 2.0-mm internal diameter, 50-mm high-performance
liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex, Inc.) and separat-
ed by gradient elution using a mixture of acetonitrile and water
each containing 0.04% formic acid with the mobile phase at a
ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/minute. The amount of acetonitrile in the
mobile phase was 45%, at which it was held for 0.2 minutes from
the beginning of the run. This was increased linearly to 95% over
0.7 minutes, and then increased linearly to 100% over 0.1 minutes
and held at 90% until 1.6 minutes, whereupon it was decreased
back to 45%. The run time was approximately 3.5 minutes. A
PerkinElmer Sciex API 4000 LC/MS–MS system with an atmo-
spheric pressure chemical ionization interface (Perkin-Elmer,
Inc.) was used for detection. Multiple-reaction monitoring with
dwell times of 100 and 80 msec was used to detect positive ions
resulting from the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 504.96!431.00
transitions for TAK-733 and the m/z 509.09!435.00 transition
for the SYR154628Z (internal standard), respectively. Quantita-
tion was based upon integrating peaks corresponding to elution
of the drug and internal standard in the extracted product ion
chromatograms. The LLOQ for plasma was 0.25 ng/mL and
tumor samples was 1.25 ng/g.

In vivo xenograft studies

Five- to six-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan–Spra-
gue–Dawley) were used. Mice were caged in groups of 5 and kept
on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and provided with sterilized food
and water ad libitum. Animals were allowed to acclimate for at least
7 days before any handling.

A375 human melanoma (ATCC) xenograft tumors were
generated by harvesting cells from mid-log phase cultures using
Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Inc.). Approximately 5  106 cells
suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (GIBCO, Invitro-
gen Corp) were injected s.c. into the right ﬂank of 6- to 8-week-
old mice. Administration of TAK-733 was initiated when
tumors in all mice in each experiment ranged in size from
100 to 200 mm3 for antitumor efﬁcacy studies and from 300 to
500 mm3 for PD studies. All drug administrations were admin-
istered orally by gavage on the basis of group mean weight once
daily for approximately 2 weeks. For administration, TAK-733
was formulated in a suspension of 0.5% methylcellulose 400
(Wako Chemical) in water.

Tumor growth was monitored at least twice weekly using
vernier calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the
formula (length  width2)/0.52. Administrations producing
>20% lethality and/or >20% net body weight loss were consid-
ered toxic. Antitumor effects were measured as the incidence of
complete regressions (CR), partial regressions (PR), and tumor
growth delay (TGD). CRs were deﬁned as tumors that were no
longer palpable. PRs were deﬁned as tumors that were reduced
by more than 50% but less than 100% of their initial size. A
minimum duration of 7 days was required for a CR or PR to be
considered durable. TGD was calculated by subtracting the time it
takes (in days) for the median tumors in the untreated control
groups to attain the evaluation size for that experiment from the
time it takes for the median tumors in the treated group to reach
the same size. Tumor growth inhibition (Treated/Control, %T/C)
was calculated on the last day of administration. A negative T/C
ratio indicated not only effective tumor growth inhibition
in comparison with control, but also effective tumor volume
reduction from day 1.

The PDTX melanoma xenograft models were generated
according to previously published methods (32). Brieﬂy, sur-
gical specimens of patients undergoing either removal of a
primary melanoma or metastatic tumor at the University of
Colorado Hospital were cut into 3 mm3 sections and implanted
subcutaneously into 5 mice for each patient. Tumors were
allowed to grow to a size of 1,000 to 1,500 mm3 (F1) at which
point they were harvested, divided, and transplanted to another
5 mice (F2) to maintain the tumor bank. After a subsequent
growth passage,
tumors were excised and expanded into
cohorts of mice for administration of TAK-733. All experiments
were conducted on F3-F5 generations. Tumors from this cohort
were allowed to grow until reaching approximately 150 to 300
mm3, at which time they were equally distributed by size into
the two groups (vehicle control and TAK-733 administered).
Mice were administered with either vehicle or TAK-733 (25 or
10 mg/kg) once daily by oral gavage. Mice were weighed twice
weekly as a means of monitoring toxicity of TAK-733. Tumor
size was evaluated three times per week by caliper measure-
ments using the following formula: tumor volume ¼ (length 
width2)/0.52. Tumor volume and body weight data were col-
lected using the Study Director software package (Studylog
Systems). The tumor growth inhibition index was determined
by calculating the tumor volume of TAK-733–administered
mice at study end (Tend) minus volume of day 1 of adminis-
tration (Tstart) of administration divided by control at end of
study (Cend) minus volume at day 1 (Cstart). Tumors with a
negative (Tend-Tstart/Cend-Cstart), which indicates regression,
were considered sensitive. Those which showed statistically

signiﬁcant growth inhibition compared with controls, but did
not regress were considered intermediate responsiveness, and
tumors that did not demonstrate signiﬁcant growth inhibition
compared with controls were considered resistant. All of the
in vivo studies were conducted in accordance with the NIH
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals was
conducted in a facility accredited by the American Association
for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The study proto-
col was approved by University of Colorado Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee before initiation. Tissue
acquisition from consented melanoma patients at the time of
removal of a primary tumor or biopsy was conducted under a
Colorado Multi-Institutional Review Board-approved protocol.

Acquired TAK-733 resistance model

To develop acquired resistance to TAK-733 in a PDTX model,
mice bearing the TAK-733–sensitive PDTX MB1374 on both
ﬂanks were administered QD with 100 mg/kg TAK-733 until
visible outgrowth of individual tumors was observed. After
approximately 2 months of administration, one ﬂank tumor
out of ten demonstrated outgrowth and was harvested when it
reached a volume of approximately 300 mm3 (data not
shown). Total RNA was extracted sequentially from: (i) tumor
regrowth, (ii) readministration to sensitive, and (iii) administer
to resistance tumors and gene expression was analyzed using
Affymetrix Human 1.0 ST gene chips (accession number:
GSE36133). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was per-
formed on these proﬁles and functional analysis of genes was
performed using NIH DAVID (33).

Statistical analysis

To determine the statistical signiﬁcance of BRAF mutational
status and sensitivity to TAK-733, the Fisher exact test was per-
formed using GraphPad Prism Software. Differences were con-
sidered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
In vitro antiproliferative effects of TAK-733 on melanoma
cell lines

Thirty-four melanoma cell lines were exposed in vitro to increasing
concentrations of TAK-733 for 72 hours. Of the 34 cell lines, 27 were
BRAFV600E mutant and seven were wild-type. SRB proliferation
assays were performed and the resulting IC50 concentrations allowed
stratiﬁcation of cell lines into three categories: relatively resistant,
intermediate, and highly sensitive. Relatively resistant and highly
sensitive lines were assigned on the basis of an IC50 that differed by at
least 10-fold (Fig. 1). Of note, there was no statistically signiﬁcant
association between BRAF status and response to TAK-733 in vitro
(P > 0.05). Of note, these results were comparable with the approved
MEK inhibitor trametinib in a subset of sensitive and resistant cell
lines, whereas the activity of the approved BRAF inhibitor vemur-
afenib was much less potent (Supplementary Table S1).

Pharmacodynamic effects of TAK-733 on melanoma cell lines
To assess the impact of TAK-733 on downstream targets of the
RAS/RAF/MEK pathway and to gain mechanistic insights into
TAK-733 antitumor activity, immunoblotting studies were per-
formed. One highly sensitive and three relatively resistant cell
lines were exposed to TAK-733 for one hour and then harvested
for isolation of total cellular protein. Immunoblotting of several
canonical MEK pathway effectors and alternative effectors was
analyzed and notably, the level of active, phosphorylated ERK
(pERK) was downregulated in both the sensitive, A375 and
resistant RPMI-7951, MeWo, and HS294T cell lines (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, in the HS294T cell line,
TAK-733 administration preferentially affected p44 pERK levels,
and to a lesser extent, p42 pERK (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although the mechanism for this selective inhibition remains
unclear, it may indicate one potential factor in resistance to
TAK-733 in this cell
line. Interestingly, there was increased

expression of pAkt observed in both sensitive A375 and resistant
HS294T and RPMI-7951 cells that was not suppressed by TAK-733
in the absence or presence of FBS. Similar studies were performed
in complete media and longer TAK-733 administration time of 24
hours to assess apoptotic markers. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S3, TAK-733 failed to induce cleaved caspase-3 or pBAD
expression under these conditions in vitro.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of
TAK-733 in vivo

To assess PK/PD relationships, TAK-733 concentrations in plasma
and tumor over time were quantitated in the sensitive A375 tumor-
bearing mice. These data were then compared with the inhibition of
tumor ERK phosphorylation over time as described in Materials and
Methods (Fig. 3). Following an oral dose of 1 mg/kg, TAK-733
concentrations peaked rapidly and corresponded with a rapid
reduction in pERK. Peak mean inhibition of pERK (>95%) was
observed at 2 hours postdose and was associated with peak plasma
(250 ng/mL) and tumor (170 ng/g) concentrations (Fig. 3A). Similar
results were observed at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Fig. 3B). Tumor
concentrations of TAK-733 remained elevated throughout the 24-
hour time course and correlated with a mean inhibition of pERK of
approximately 39% to 99% (Supplementary Table S2). The time
course of pERK reduction corresponded approximately with the
tumor concentrations, as depicted in Fig. 3A. Mean plasma concen-
tration of TAK-733 decreased rapidly from 8 hours to 16 hours
postdose. A summary of the 24 and 48 plasma and tumor con-
centrations of TAK-733 is presented in Supplementary Table S3.

Antitumor activity of TAK-733 in athymic nude mice bearing
A375 human melanoma tumors

Daily oral administration of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg of TAK-733
for 14 days (days 10–23) resulted in tumor growth delay in the

icantly inhibited tumor growth on an intermittent dosing sched-
ule of 3 days per week for 2 weeks (days 10, 13, 15, 17, 20, and 22).

tered with 160 mg/kg of TAK-733 intermittently. Responses, CR,
and PR were also observed in mice administered with 70, 100, and
160 mg/kg of TAK—733 intermittently. The tumor regression rate
was more pronounced with the intermittent administration reg-
imen; the greatest reduction in tumor volume was observed at 160
mg/kg (57.29%), versus a maximum reduction of 46.97% at 30
mg/kg once daily (Supplementary Table S4). By the last day of
administration, tumor growth was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05 for %T/
C, Student t test) inhibited in mice administered 3, 10, and 30 mg/
kg once daily or 35, 70, 100, and 160 mg/kg intermittently.

To assess the potential effects of TAK-733 against human
melanoma tumors, PDTX models were established in athymic
nude mice. Because they are never cultured on plastic, PDTX
models recapitulate the human tumor from which they were
derived with respect to tumor architecture, stroma, mutational
status, etc. and are thus considered more stringent models for
efﬁcacy studies (32, 34). The nude mice carrying the PDTX were
then randomized into two groups: control and TAK-733 admin-
istered (10 or 25 mg/kg) once daily by oral gavage as described in
Materials and Methods, and tumors were measured by caliper
three times per week. Figure 5A depicts the percent change in
volume from baseline in administered tumors measured at the
end of study. A total of eleven individual PDTXs were adminis-
tered with TAK-733. Of these, six harbored the BRAFV600E muta-
tion, ﬁve were BRAFWT, one model carried an NRASQ61L mutation,
and one model carried an NRASQ61H mutation. Amongst these

Effects of TAK-733 on growth of A375 melanoma tumor xenografts in
athymic nude mice. A375 melanoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in
the ﬂank of nu/nu mice (5/group). Administration was initiated 10 days after
the tumor implant, when all mice had tumors ranging in size from 80 to
225 mm3 (day 10). TAK-733 was given orally daily for 14 days (QD 1-14) or
3 days per week for two cycles (M, TH, SAT 2).

models, BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive. In
all but one PDTX, MB947 (BRAFV600E, P ¼ 0.41), TAK-733
demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant antitumor activity when
compared with controls (P < 0.0001–0.03). Furthermore, in
45% of the mice administered with TAK-733, tumor regression
was observed. Representative growth curves are depicted
in Fig. 5B–E. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no association
between BRAFV600E mutational status and responsiveness to TAK-
733 in these PDTX models (P > 0.5). A representative PDTX
model, MB 1255, is depicted in Supplementary Fig. S4, demon-
strating increased antitumor activity.

To assess tumor regrowth kinetics after administration of TAK-
733, administration was discontinued in one model, MB1374,
and tumor regrowth was observed after approximately 60 days.
Dosing with TAK-733 was then restarted 111 days after the prior
cessation and tumor regression was again observed (Fig. 6). A
similar pattern of tumor growth and regression was observed after
a second TAK-733 holiday followed by the reinstitution of dosing.
The doses and schedule used in this study (10 and 25mg/kg/
day) were within the tolerability limits for TAK-733 in mice and
no animals exhibited obvious signs of toxicity as indicated by
outward morbidity or weight loss. Tumor samples harvested at the
end of the study were collected 1 hour after TAK-733 adminis-
tration and evaluated for pharmacodynamic response. As
depicted in Supplementary Fig. S5, pERK was downregulated in
the TAK-733 administered mice compared with controls, regard-
less of BRAFV600E mutational status, conﬁrming inhibition of
MEK by TAK-733. Interestingly, pS6 protein, a downstream sub-
strate of P-70 S6 kinase and an effector of the PI3K pathway, was
robustly inhibited (particularly taking into account the loading
control of a-tubulin) in the resistant MB947 PDTX, which was
also observed in MB1547 but not MB1337.

Acquired resistance to TAK-733 in PDTX model

Acquired resistance to TAK-733 was observed as outgrowth
of a single MB1374 tumor administered chronically with

25 mg/kg TAK-733 for 2 months (data not shown). To examine
genetic alterations associated with the acquired resistance to
TAK-733, samples from tumor regrowth, readminister to sen-
sitive and administer to resistance from the sensitive explant
model MB1374 (Fig. 6) were harvested. Global gene expres-
sion proﬁling identiﬁed transcriptional changes after acquired
resistance to TAK-733. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering on
these proﬁles demonstrated that the tumor regrowth and
administer to resistance samples clustered together, suggesting
that there are similar transcriptional proﬁles and differences
from the readminister to sensitive proﬁle (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Using gene expression changes of 1.5-fold change as
cutoff, we identiﬁed that 289 and 133 genes were up- and
downregulated in the two resistant samples as compared with
the readminister to sensitive. Functional analysis of these
genes by NIH DAVID (33) revealed that the upregulated genes
in the resistant samples were enriched with cell adhesion
molecules (P ¼ 8.710-5, FDR ¼ 0.009) and axon guidance
(P ¼ 0.009, FDR ¼ 0.09), whereas downregulated genes were
involved in homologous recombination (P ¼ 0.002, FDR ¼
0.02) and systemic lupus erythematosus (P ¼ 0.01, FDR ¼
0.1), according to KEGG pathway deﬁnitions (35).

Discussion

Although the signiﬁcance of the discovery of the BRAFV600E/K
mutation and its role as a driver mutation in the development and
progression of malignant melanoma has been substantial, the
clinical translation of this discovery into effective therapeutics has
been relatively short-lived due to de novo or acquired resistance
(11, 22, 23). Viable alternative therapies for this patient popula-
tion include the recently approved use of MEK inhibitors either as
single agents or in combination with RAF inhibitors (17, 27, 28).
However, the clinical efﬁcacy of MEK inhibitors tested to date has
been modest,
likely due to a narrow therapeutic window,
highlighting the need for the development of more potent com-
pounds with improved toxicity proﬁles. The goal of this study was
to evaluate the activity of a potent and selective MEK inhibitor,
TAK-733, against preclinical models of melanoma. Although
previous studies have been conducted demonstrating TAK-733
activity against melanoma cell lines in vitro (25), we sought to
expand these studies into more clinically relevant in vivo murine
models of melanoma. The translation of preclinical evidence into
clinical practice success has historically been challenging and
often fruitless. A number of factors, including genetic changes
and divergence in cell lines grown outside the normal tumor
environment, genetic divergence between the primary tumor and
corresponding cell line, and heterogeneous patient tumors, are
cited as likely culprits for the lack of successful preclinical to
clinical translation (34, 36). The use of PDTX is increasingly being
applied in oncology drug development as these models retain the
molecular and genetic heterogeneity of human tumors and thus
provide a more clinically relevant model for analysis of drug
activity and predictive biomarker development (32, 34, 37, 38).
Here, we utilized 11 distinct PDTX models, representing varying
genetic backgrounds to assess the antitumor activity of TAK-733.
Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that tumors
harboring BRAFV600 mutations confer an oncogene addiction to
the MAPK pathway for survival, providing an opportunity for
therapeutic intervention (11, 14, 29, 39–43). Although targeting
BRAF is a logical and effective therapeutic strategy, these tumors

inevitably acquire additional mutations that allow them to bypass
the inhibition, resulting in relapse and tumor progression. The
types of resistance identiﬁed to date include MAPK pathway-
dependent mechanisms such as upregulation of NRAS and sub-
sequent signaling through CRAF (21, 22), upregulation of the
MAP3K8 gene COT, which can drive MAPK signaling through
MEK-dependent mechanisms independent of RAF signaling (20),
and activating mutations in MEK (19, 23). These ﬁndings have
directed the design of clinical trials testing the rational combina-
tion of BRAFV600 and MEK inhibitors which have resulted in
improved survival in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma
compared with BRAF inhibitors alone, highlighting the need for
effective MEK inhibitors (28). In addition, MAPK-independent
resistance mechanisms have been identiﬁed, including upregula-
tion of receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRa that may signal
through the PI3K/AKT pathway (22) and dictate novel combina-
tion strategies targeting these pathways.

The activity of TAK-733 observed in both BRAFWT and
BRAFV600E melanoma models suggests that it may have distinct
therapeutic potential. Two of the TAK-733–responsive BRAFWT
PDTX models harbored NRAS mutations, supporting the notion
that MEK1/2 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic target for
BRAFWT patients carrying an alternate driver mutation in the
MAPK pathway. The association of additional driver mutations
and responsiveness to TAK-733 deserves further study that could
provide the rationale for treatment of a deﬁned molecular subset
of BRAFWT patients.

In this study, we observed antitumor activity of TAK-733
against PDTX melanoma models. Indeed, of the 11 PDTX tested,
we found only one example of a resistant model, MB947, which is
a V600E mutant. The level of activity and lack of resistance
observed in 91% of our explant models suggest that resistance
to BRAF inhibitors conferred through activating mutations in
MEK can potentially be overcome by a potent MEK inhibitor,
such as TAK-733. Interestingly, immunoblotting demonstrated
pERK downregulation in the resistant MB947 tumors suggesting
effective MEK inhibition that may be necessary but not sufﬁcient
for antitumor activity. Cross-talk between the MAPK and

PI3K/AKT pathways represents a potential bypass to MEK inhi-
bition; however, upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway was not
consistently observed. These ﬁndings suggest alternative resis-
tance mechanisms outside of the MAPK pathway that have yet
to be identiﬁed. Despite the activity of TAK-733 in these PDTX
models, we expect that similar to other targeted therapies, resis-
tance is likely to develop.

To identify potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to
TAK-733, we administered a sensitive PDTX model with TAK-
733 to resistance, as measured by escape from tumor growth
inhibition. Unbiased gene expression analysis identiﬁed genes
and pathways that were differentially expressed between
tumor regrowth, readministration to sensitive, and adminis-
tration to resistance samples from the sensitive explant model
MB1374. Among the core genes of the axon guidance are
EPHA2, EPHB4, ABLIM3, SEMA3D, L1CAM, SEMA3A, and
NFATC2. Notably, overexpression of EPHA2 (EPH receptor
A2) has been identiﬁed as a resistance mechanism to HER2
treatment in breast cancer (44), suggesting cross-talk between
EphA and the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway in the resis-
tance stage (45).

In summary, TAK-733 demonstrated potent antitumor activ-
ity in vitro and in vivo in preclinical melanoma models of
melanoma. Tumor regression was observed in 45% of murine
PDTX models which is remarkable and suggests that further
studies in humans are warranted. On the basis of the recently
characterized resistance mechanisms of targeted BRAF inhibi-
tors in patients with melanoma, the combination of TAK-733
with other agents such as BRAF or PI3K pathway inhibitors
could potentially exhibit synergistic effects and may lead to
more durable clinical beneﬁt in subsequent studies.
