The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction, an oncogenic pathway implicated in a variety of human
cancers, is a key target in anticancer drug design. A novel series of pyrimidylpyrrole ERK inhibitors has
been identified. Discovery of a conformational change for lead compound 2, when bound to ERK2
relative to antitarget GSK3, enabled structure-guided selectivity optimization, which led to the
discovery of 11e, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of ERK.

Introduction

Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERKa signal transduc-
tion pathway has been observed in numerous tumor types.
This pathway controls a number of fundamental cellular
processes including cell survival, proliferation, motility, and
differentiation, and its constitutive activation has been
reported in lung, colon, pancreatic, renal, and ovarian
cancers.1-5 Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a
pivotal kinase in the pathway downstream of Ras, Raf, and
MEK, acting as a central link between multiple signaling
pathways. We have recently reported the discovery of pyra-
zolylpyrroles as nanomolar selective ERK inhibitors.6 Herein
we describe our efforts that combine X-ray crystallography,
molecular modeling, and medicinal chemistry toward dis-
covery and optimization of pyrimidylpyrroles, a novel series
of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable ERK inhibitors.
Despite the encouraging kinase selectivity profile of 1
(Figure 1), the key shortcoming of the pyrazolylpyrrole series
remained its insufficient cellular activity (IC50=0.54 μM for 1
in the Colo205 cell proliferation assay).6 We chose to search
for alternative hinge binding moieties to replace the pyra-
zole of 1 and prepared a series of aminopyrimidine-based
analogues. The aminopyrimidine library culminated in the
discovery of 2, a potent pyrimidylpyrrole ERK inhibitor
(KI < 2 nM) possessing improved cellular activity (IC50 =
29 nM in the HT29 cell proliferation assay). Unfortunately, the
increased cellular potency was accompanied by a significantly
degraded selectivity profile. The three kinases affected the most
were glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), cyclin-dependent

kinase 2 (CDK2), and AuroraA, with KI values in the 7-
15 nM range (Table 1). This selectivity profile compared
unfavorably with that of 1, which produced KI values of
3.3 μM for GSK3 and >4 μM for both CDK2 and AuroraA.6
We initiated crystallographic studies of 2 in order to further
our structural understanding of the key binding elements
responsible for its ERK inhibition relative to the previously
described pyrazolylpyrrole series exemplified by 1.

Results and Discussion

The resulting X-ray structure (Figure 2) confirmed that the
aminopyrimidine fragment of 2 was critical to its activity,
making two hydrogen bonds to the hinge region of ERK.
Importantly, while the pyrazole ring in 1 engaged the main
chain carbonyl of Asp104 in addition to the amide NH of
Met106, the aminopyrimidine of 2 formed the second hydro-
gen bond to the main chain carbonyl of Met106. The former
orientation is incompatible with 2, since it would result in a
clash between the gatekeeper Gln103 side chain and the
N-phenyl fragment of 2. However, the most surprising aspect
of the X-ray structure was the location of the pyrrole linker in
2 relative to 1. The pyrrole NH is no longer involved in a
hydrogen bond with the amide oxygen of the gatekeeper
residue Gln103, as observed for 1. In fact, the pyrrole of 2
is flipped nearly 180° relative to 1, with the NH proton
pointing toward solvent. The gatekeeper residue plays a
well-established role in determining the selectivity of kinase
inhibitors. The gatekeeper residue in GSK3 and AuroraA is
Leu, while the corresponding residue in CDK2 is Phe. The
activity of 2 increased by over 250-fold against these three
targets compared to 1. We believe that the degraded selectivity
observed for 2 is the result of the loss of gatekeeper recognition
function. The amide portion of 2 is making interactions
similar to those seen earlier for 1. The amide carbonyl of 2
forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic Lys52, and the
phenylglycinol motif makes a hydrophobic interaction with
the glycine-rich loop.

ERK2.

Pyrimidylpyrroles were prepared as described in Scheme 1.
Starting with commercially available trichloroacetylpyrrole,
Friedel-Crafts acylation produced diketone 3. The activated
trichloromethylketone was converted to the corresponding
ester 4 using sodium methoxide. Pyrrole ring of ester 4 was
protected with the tosyl protecting group. Treatment of 5 with
dimethylformamide di-tert-butylacetal
followed by cycli-
zation with the appropriate arylguanidine 12 and subsequent
hydrolysis afforded carboxylic acid 8. Amide coupling with

-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide

To enable rational design of ERK selectivity for 2, we chose
to study its binding conformation in GSK3. We have previously
reported the X-ray structure of GSK3,7 and the available
construct allowed for efficient ligand crystallization. The orien-
tation of 2 bound to GSK3 is essentially identical to that seen in
ERK (Figure 3A). The notable difference is the conformation of
the phenylaminopyrimidine; the aniline is in the plane of the
aminopyridine in GSK3, while in ERK the phenyl ring is twisted
out of plane by 39°. This observation may be attributed to two

factors: the size difference between the proximal hinge Tyr134
residue in GSK3 and its Leu105 counterpart in ERK, and the
conformation differences of the hinge backbones. The larger
aromatic side chain of Tyr134 appears to impart coplanarity on
the aniline portion of 2. Such preference was less pronounced
when Tyr134 side chain was replaced with leucine. In addition,
the tighter hinge turn seen in ERK results in the placement of the
main chain carbonyl of Glu107 approximately 1 A˚ closer to the
ligand relative to the corresponding Pro136 of GSK3, thus
favoring a “twisted” conformation observed in ERK. Modeling
predicted that introducing an ortho-substituent into the aniline
ring would help stabilize the “twisted” conformation of 2 in
ERK and destabilize the in-plane GSK-bound conformation.
Small substituents (9a-d, Table 1) were effective at maintaining
ERK inhibition and ablating antitarget activity. For instance,
2-chloro substituent (9a) provided a 27-fold reduction in GSK3
activity along with 15-fold drop in CDK2 and 100-fold decrease
in AuroraA activity, two other kinases in which Leu105 is
replaced by aromatic residues, Phe82 in CDK2 and Tyr212 in
AuroraA. The smallest substituent, 2-fluoro (9d), was least
effective because of a less pronounced effect on the aniline
torsion angle. A larger 2-CF3 substituent (9e) essentially
removed GSK3, CDK2, and AuroraA activity but lost cellular
activity. 2-Hydroxy substituent (9f) tended to lose both cellular
activity and selectivity except in the case of GSK3, in which the
hydroxyl likely engages the side chain phenol of Tyr134. To
confirm the stabilized out of plane conformation induced by the
ortho-substituent, we obtained the X-ray structure of ERK-
bound 9a. Indeed, the ortho-substitution is compatible with
the ERK active site, as both KI and the bound conformation
were unchanged upon going from 2 to 9a (Figure 3B). Addition
of the o-chloro substituent in 9a is incompatible with the planar
GSK3-bound structure of 2, as the chlorine would clash with the
main chain carbonyl of hinge Val135. The twisted conformation
of 9a as bound to ERK can be expected to position the chlorine
within 2.6 A˚ of the Tyr134 side chain, and it is this detrimental
interaction that likely accounts for a dramatic drop on potency
against GSK3 and related kinases seen for 9a.

Another potential selectivity opportunity was located in the
phenylglycinol portion of the molecule. The (S)-stereochemi-
stry was strongly preferred for phenylglycinol, as 10a (Table 2)
lost over 300-fold in ERK affinity. Preparation of 3-substi-
tuted (S)-phenylglycinols 10b-d was prompted by comparing
the structures of 1 and 2 and led to a 10- to 100-fold separation
between ERK and other kinases, likely exploiting the differ-
ential flexibility of glycine-rich loop regions. Again, 3-fluoro
(10b) was too small to effectively engage the ERK glycine-rich
loop in a selective fashion.

We proceeded to combine the substitutions to both the aniline
and the phenylglycinol to capitalize on the anticipated additive
effect of these changes. Indeed, while 2-substituted anilines were
most efficient at removing AuroraA activity, the 3-substituted
phenylglycinols were only modestly selective against AuroraA.
The 3-chloro derivative 10c was chosen as the reference to study
combined substitutions because of its selectivity against GSK3
and CDK2, as well as potent cellular activity (HT29 IC50=100
nM). As shown in Table 3, the selectivity against AuroraA was
improved significantly for most compounds, while GSK3 and
CDK2 selectivity margins were also acceptable. Surprisingly,
11a showed strong inhibition of GSK3, in contrast to closely
related 9b and 10c. Larger aniline substituents, e.g., 11i and 11l,
were typically somewhat detrimental to ERK activity; however,
most combinations produced selective ERK inhibitors with
sub-100 nM cellular potency.

Compound 11e was chosen for further studies because of its
superior potency and selectivity profile. The extensive coun-
terscreening profile of 11e is shown in Table S1. It is over 200-
fold selective against GSK3, CDK2, and AuroraA and >500-
fold selective against other kinases tested. In addition, 11e is
active in the HT29 cell proliferation assay (IC50=48 nM) and
was found to be orally bioavailable in both rat (F=65%; t1/2=
3 h) and mouse (F=67%; t1/2=4.4 h). A more complete PK
profile for 11e can be found in Supporting Information.

rounds of structure-guided optimization. In particular, the
specificity for ERK was optimized following the discovery of a
conformational change for 2 when bound to ERK2 relative to
antitarget GSK3. Stabilizing the ERK-bound conformation
of 2 by introducing additional functionality, we were able to
design 11e, a selective subnanomolar ERK2 inhibitor with
potent cellular activity.

This study highlights the utility of rigorous crystallographic
studies in multiple kinases to selectivity design. In our experience,

that occur upon binding to kinases have provided invaluable
guidance for addressing the kinase selectivity problem.

Experimental Section

General Experimental Details. All commercial reagents and
anhydrous solvents were obtained from commercial sources and
were used without further purification, unless otherwise speci-
fied. Mass samples were analyzed on a MicroMass ZQ, ZMD,

Quattro LC, or Quatro II mass spectrometer operated in a single
MS mode with electrospray ionization. Samples were intro-
duced into the mass spectrometer using flow injection (FIA)
or chromatography. The mobile phase for all mass analysis
consisted of acetonitrile-water mixtures with either 0.2% for-
mic acid or 5 mM ammonium formate (pH 7). High resolution
mass spectra were measured using a 9.4 T APEX III FTMS
Bruker Daltonics instrument. The following HPLC methods
were used to obtain the reported retention times: (i) Method A:
YMC Pro18 column, 50 mm  4.6 mm; linear gradient from
10% to 90% CH3CN in H2O over 5 min; flow rate 0.8 mL/min.
(ii) Method B: Waters Symmetry C18 column, 4.6 mm  50 mm;
linear gradient from 10% to 90% CH3CN in H2O over 3 min
(0.2% formic acid); flow rate 1.5 mL/min. (iii) Method C: Water
symmetry C18 column, 4.6 mm  50 mm; linear gradient from
2% to 90% CH3CN in H2O over 3 min (2% ammonium
formate); flow rate 1.5 mL/min; detection diode array. 1H
NMR spectra (δ, ppm) was recorded either using a Bruker
DRX-500 (500 MHz) or Bruker Avance II-300 (300 MHz)
instrument. Elemental analyses were performed by Quantitative
Technologies Inc. Column chromatography was performed
using Merck silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063 mm). Preparative reverse
phase chromatography was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax
SB-C18 column, 21.2 mm 100 mm, a linear gradient from 10%
to 90% CH3CN in H2O over 10 min (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid),
and a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The aryl guanidines 12a-r were
synthesized according to published procedures.8 The substi-
tuted phenylglycinols 13b-d were prepared following literature
procedures.9

The purity of final compounds was assessed on the basis of
analytical HPLC, and the results were greater than 95% unless
specified otherwise.

Molecular Modeling. Constrained docking studies were per-
formed with Glide, version 3.0,10 in standard docking mode and
used X-ray structures of related ligands as docking templates.
The structures were protonated at pH 7. Docked poses
were reminimized in MMFF94s11 force field as implemented
in MOE.12
