Skin ﬁndings are a rare but important aspect of the evaluation and management of patients with tumors
of the nervous system. Skin ﬁndings have the highest prevalence in genetic tumor syndromes termed
neuro-genodermatoses, which include neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2),
and tuberous sclerosis. Skin changes are observed in patients with non-syndromic nervous system
malignancy, often as a result of pharmacotherapy. The skin may also manifest ﬁndings in paraneoplastic
conditions that affect the nervous system, providing an early indication of underlying neoplasm,
including dermatomyosistis, neuropathic itch, and brachioradial pruritus. In this article, we review the
major cutaneous ﬁndings in patients with tumors of the brain, spine, and peripheral nervous system
focusing on (1) cutaneous manifestations of genetic and sporadic primary nervous system tumor
syndromes, and (2) paraneoplastic neurological syndromes with prominent cutaneous features.

Introduction

The nervous and integument systems are intimately linked.
Somatic peripheral nerves carry sensory information to cutaneous
dermatomes via alpha-Beta, alpha-Delta, and C ﬁbers, which
terminate in the sensory apparati of the skin. Sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerves control piloerection, eccrine skin gland
function, and subcutaneous vascular tone. Biologically, melano-
cytes are derivatives of the neural crest and share neuroembryonic
origins with nervous tissues contained within the brain and
spinal cord.

Hence, while rare, cutaneous manifestations of neuro-oncology
are clinically relevant and potentially biologically important fea-
tures of many tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Skin ﬁndings are most prevalent
in the genetic neuro-oncologic tumor syndromes. In neuroﬁbro-
matosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis, cutaneous ﬁndings
contribute to the criteria used to make the clinical diagnoses. In
neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) and other rarer tumor syndromes,
skin ﬁndings can be the ﬁrst signs of disease providing an
important early indication of an underlying tumor syndrome
(Supplemental Table and Supplemental Fig. 1). Skin ﬁndings are

rarely observed in patients with sporadic primary tumors of the
brain and spinal cord (eg, generalized and localized isolated
pruritus, brachioradial pruritus, and trigeminal trophic syndrome).
However, ongoing investigation of biologically targeted agents for
neuro-oncology indications has resulted in an increased frequency
of treatment-related skin changes in neuro-oncology. Cutaneous
manifestations may also be present in paraneoplastic neurological
syndromes and herald an underlying malignancy.

In this article we review the major cutaneous ﬁndings in patients
with nervous system tumors focusing speciﬁcally on (1) cutaneous
features of the genetic and sporadic primary tumor syndromes,
and (2) cutaneous manifestations of paraneoplastic neurological
syndromes.

2.1. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common single
mutation genetically inherited neurologic disorder affecting
approximately 1 in 2,500–4,000 live-births [1]. This tumor-
suppressor syndrome results from loss of function of the neuro-
ﬁbromin protein encoded by the NF1 gene on chromosome 17
(17q11.2) [2]. Germline mutation in the NF1 gene results in a

vasculature, and the CNS and PNS. The hallmark of this condition is
the development of benign tumors of the skin and the peripheral
nerve sheath: cutaneous and plexiform neuroﬁbromas. While gene
testing of NF1 is used in select cases to establish a diagnosis, most
patients are diagnosed clinically using criteria that focus on
cutaneous ﬁndings and has been established by National Institutes
of Health (Table 1) [3, 4].

Cutaneous ﬁndings are common in patients with NF1 but vary
over a patient’s lifetime [5]. Café au lait macules present as ﬂat tan
patches with no appreciable texture or scaling and are common at
birth (Fig. 1A). Typical café au lait macules of NF1 have uniform
pigmentation with distinct, regular borders, in contrast to those
with irregular borders or nonhomogeneous pigmentation, which
is atypical for NF1. These lesions are frequently brought to the
attention of pediatricians by a child’s parents as they are the most
universal ﬁndings and often the ﬁrst sign of disease. While many
children with isolated café au lait macules are referred to specialty
clinics to rule out NF1, most will not develop NF1. Comprehensive
dermatologic evaluation is helpful as studies show that deﬁning
the number and appearance (ie, typical v atypical) of café au lait
macules has important predictive value for diagnosis.
In one
epidemiologic study, 77% of patients with six or more café au lait
macules at presentation ultimately met clinical criteria for diag-
nosis of NF1 by study end with the most common conﬁrmatory
ﬁndings being intertriginous freckling (77%), Lisch nodules (18%),
or plexiform neuroﬁbroma (6%). Lesion appearance was important
with less than 5% (or 2/42 patients) of patients with atypical
lesions ultimately meeting criteria for NF1 [6]. In cases of diag-
nostic uncertainty such as with isolated café au lait macules
without conﬁrmatory ﬁndings for NF1, genetic testing is available
but best performed in the setting of a genetic or multidisciplinary
clinic specializing in the care of NF1 patients. Other skin manifes-
tations of NF1 include small pigmented macules in the axillae or
groin skin, which has been termed Crowe’s sign (Fig. 1D) [7].
Cutaneous neuroﬁbromas (cNFs) are superﬁcial tumors of the
peripheral nerve sheath which manifest as skin-colored or slightly
pink-brown soft papules and nodules. These lesions invaginate
when compressed, a ﬁnding that has been termed the
“button-hole” sign [8]. Most cNFs are painless though a subset
may present with pain exacerbated by palpation. Cutaneous
neuroﬁbromas are less common in childhood and typically begin
to appear in adolescence. Unlike café au lait macules which may
fade during adulthood, cNFs can increase in size and number
throughout life. In severe cases hundreds of lesions may develop,
causing substantial disﬁguration and psychosocial distress
(Fig. 1B). Surgical removal can be considered for painful tumors,
to correct deforming lesions, or when lesions develop in a
problematic region (ie, brassiere line, digits). Lisch nodules are
painless pigmented brown hamartomas arising on the iris of the

eye. These common lesions develop during adolescence and reach
a prevalence of 495% by age 21 [9]. Fortunately, they are not
associated with any functional impact.

Oncologic manifestations of NF1 include both nervous and non-
nervous system tumors. Non-nervous system malignancies vary in
prevalence and include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (occurring
in 5%–25%) [10] and neuroendocrine tumors such as pheo-
chromocytoma (occurring in around 15%)
[11,12]. Plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (pNFs) are the major PNS tumor occurring in
approximately 30%–55% of patients [13,14]. These tumors are
heterogeneous, and are composed of Schwann cells and neuronal
axons, ﬁbroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, perineural cells, and
extracellular matrix [15]. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas may be isolated
to the deep nerves, may involve the skin, or may have a
combination of deep and superﬁcial components. Similarly, their
radiographic appearance may be diffuse, nodular, or a combination
of both. When deep, they are composed of multiple hypertrophic
nerve sheaths grouped together and may have a “bag of worms”
texture upon palpation. Cutaneous involvement manifests as
thickening and discoloration of the skin surface (Fig. 1C). While
they can occur at any location in the body, they are most
frequently found in the head and neck region (25%–38%), followed
by the extremities (22%–30%), trunk (16%–17%), and paraspinal
area (12%–29%) [16, 17]. In contrast to cNFs, plexiform lesions are a
common source of neuropathic pain and in some cases neurologic
dysfunction with sensory loss or motor dysfunction [18]. The
lifetime risk of malignant transformation to malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is 8%–13% and there is suggestion of
a worse prognosis than what is experienced with sporadic MPNST
[19]. A high index of suspicion and evaluation by a multidiscipli-
nary team using neuroimaging and histopathologic evaluation of
tissue are necessary for pNFs that present with new pain or rapid
growth to ensure that they are not undergoing malignant trans-
formation [20–22]. In the CNS, though tumors do occur through-
out the cortex and brainstem, optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)
account for the majority of CNS neoplasms and are present in up
to 15%–20% of NF1 children [23–25]. Yearly ophthalmologic
evaluation is used to screen for these lesions until age 410 years,
after which the majority will remain stable or occasionally regress
[26]. Screening neuroimaging is controversial, but generally not
pursued unless patients develop loss of visual acuity, proptosis,
precocious puberty, or visual ﬁeld deﬁcits [27]. In those with
known lesions,
surveillance with gadolinium-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brian (with
orbits) in combination with regular ophthalmologic evaluation is
recommended. The majority of OPGs are indolent with two thirds
never requiring treatment [28, 29].

2.2. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant
tumor-suppressor syndrome less common than NF1 affecting
1 in 33,000–40,000 live births [29]. Mutation in the NF2 gene on
chromosome 22 (22q12) results in loss of functioning merlin or
schwannomin protein and contributes to nervous system tumors,
including meningiomas, ependymomas, and spinal and cranial
nerve schwannomas. The National
Institutes of Health (NIH)
clinical diagnostic criteria include: (1) the presence of bilateral
vestibular schwannomas, or (2) a family history of NF2 and either
unilateral vestibular schwannoma or any two other tumors
associated with NF2, including the presence of a juvenile posterior
subcapsular cataract [30, 31]. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are
pathognomonic for NF2 and present with hearing loss, tinnitus,
balance difﬁculty, and rarely vertigo. Intracranial or spinal menin-
giomas are present in approximately 50% of patients and are
benign World Health Organization (WHO) grade I lesions [32]. In

contrast to sporadic meningiomas, patients with NF2 often possess
multiple intra- or extracranial lesions and meningiomatosis [33].
Spinal ependymomas are present in 33%–53% of patients but are
typically asymptomatic, indolent, WHO grade I neoplasms located
at the cervicomedullary junction or cervical spine [32].

Cutaneous manifestations are more subtle in NF2 than in NF1.
Café au lait macules and dermal tumors are seen and in some cases
may be the earliest observable manifestations of disease [34].
Epidemiologic studies suggest that up to 70% of patients with NF2
have skin tumors, though only 10% harbor more than 10 lesions
[35]. Cutaneous tumors in NF2 are usually schwannomas, derived
from myelin producing Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves,
though neuroﬁbromas similar to those occurring in NF1 do occur
[36]. The schwannomas may develop superﬁcially and appear as
slightly raised areas of pigmented skin with excess hair. Deeper
lesions are also observed and present as focal or fusiform swelling
of a palpable nerve [35]. NF2-associated cutaneous schwannomas
may be asymptomatic or produce severe dysesthetic pain neces-
sitating systemic pharmacotherapy, regional nerve block, or in
select refractory cases surgical removal of the causative lesion.

2.3. Tuberous sclerosis complex

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is another autosomal domi-
nant tumor-suppressor syndrome characterized by benign hamar-
tomas of the skin, brain, heart, and kidney, as well as cognitive
deﬁcits, neurobehavioral abnormalities (eg, autism), and epilepsy
[37] (Table 2). Two disease causing genes have been identiﬁed
including the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 (9q34) and TSC2 on
chromosome 16 (16p13), which encode hamartin and tubulin,
respectively [38, 39].

Tuberous sclerosis, similar to NF1, has numerous skin ﬁndings
which arise at different stages of development. The earliest
cutaneous sign is the presence of “ash leaf spots”, which can
present at birth (Fig. 2A). These hypopigmented nonscaling small

macules or patches are reported in over 95% of TSC patients and
easily visualized in patients with a darker baseline skin tone [40].
In those with paler skin tones, the use of a Woods lamp (ultraviolet
light) can illuminate subtle lesions. The presence of three of more
hypomelanotic macules is suggestive of TSC (Fig. 2D). Facial
angioﬁbromas, the second most common skin manifestation
of TSC, present as clusters of multiple small monomorphic
brownish-red papules, which appear almost acneiform on the
nose and cheeks starting in childhood (Fig. 2B) [40]. These lesions
can be quite disﬁguring in more severe cases (Fig. 2C). Treatment
includes dermabrasion (sanding of the skin), laser ablation, or
topical rapamycin. Periungual ﬁbromas, also known as Koenen’s
tumors, are skin-colored papules that grow on cuticular skin of
hands and feet (Fig. 2E). They appear around puberty and the main
method of treatment is surgical excision. The Shagreen patch, a
connective tissue nevus, appears as a skin colored or slightly
hyperpigmented plaque with ﬁrm texture. The induration of the

(B) facial angioﬁbromas, (C) facial angioﬁbromas and forehead plaque, (D) multiple ash leaf macules, (E) Koenen’s tumors or periungual ﬁbromas, and (F) intraoral ﬁbromas.

Shagreen patch can give the skin a dimpled peau d’orange (French
for “skin of an orange”) appearance. These lesions frequently occur
asymmetrically over the dorsal trunk often in the lower back and
are observed in about 50% of patients with TSC [40]. Confetti
macules are collections of tiny hypopigmented macules grouped
together on the skin. Less common skin ﬁndings in TSC include the
presence of molluscum ﬁbrosum pendulum (ie, soft pedunculated
growths on the neck), café au lait macules, or a forehead plaque
(Fig. 2C). Tuberous sclerosis complex can also affect the mucosal
skin, with development of ﬁbromas similar to those found on the
face and cuticular skin [41]. These are most commonly seen on
gingival mucosa but can occur on any intraoral mucosal surface
(Fig. 2F). Pits in the enamel of the teeth can also be seen.

Oncologic manifestations of TSC include cortical tubers, sub-
ependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.
Cortical tubers are present in approximately 70% of patients with
TSC and represent areas of non-neoplastic cortical dysplasia [42].
The cortical location results in a propensity to epileptogenesis
and contributes to the 85% incidence of epilepsy in TSC [43].
Subependymal nodules are benign hamartomas composed of
abnormal glia and vascular tissue covered by an ependymal lining.
They are often located between the head of the caudate and lateral
ventricle [44]. These lesions appear as hyperintensities on T2-
weighted MRI imaging and do not enhance with contrast admin-
istration. In contrast, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas do
typically enhance with contrast. Surgical resection is often the only
treatment needed for these WHO grade I gliomas.

3. Cutaneous ﬁndings in sporadic neuro-oncologic disease

While cutaneous features herald an underlying nervous system
neoplasm in genetic nervous system tumor syndromes, systematic
skin ﬁndings are much less common in patients with sporadic CNS
or PNS tumors. Systemic metastasis is not typical of primary brain
tumors [45, 46] and metastatic spread to the skin is exceedingly

rare. Reports have described local spread to the adjacent scalp
[47, 48] in some cases with skin seeding around the time of
operative intervention [48, 49]. Distant cutaneous metastasis has
been reported but is exceptional [50,51]. Accordingly, skin checks
surveying for cutaneous involvement are not routinely performed.
Hence, few studies have prospectively evaluated cutaneous
ﬁndings in patients with sporadic primary brain tumors. A study
published in 1975 presented data on cutaneous ﬁndings in 77
patients with primary (86%), secondary (4%), and other brain
tumors (10%, excluding tumors of the hypophysis). Skin ﬁndings
attributable to the tumors were prevalent in 32% of patients. The
authors grouped these into (1) complaints of pruritus (present in
54% of patients), (2) pigmentary changes (29% of patients), and
(3) hyperkeratotic changes (27% of patients) [52]. Lesion size,
intracranial pressure, and medications were not reported, which
may have impacted the results in this study published prior to the
era of widespread incorporation of neuroimaging and early detec-
tion of these tumors. In 2002, a prospective study of 107 patients
with either primary brain tumors or paraneoplastic neurological
syndrome clinically assessed for the presence of palmar erythema
[53]. Signiﬁcant erythema was present in 6.5% of patients and
slight or localized erythema in 18.5%. These incidence rates were
described as similar to those in liver diseases, pregnancy, and
rheumatoid arthritis [53]. Thus with the exception of the three
discrete syndromes described below, cutaneous ﬁndings in
patients with primary brain or spinal cord tumors should prompt
a comprehensive medical and dermatologic evaluation with atten-
tion paid to comorbid medications, effects of radiation therapy,
and other factors that may contribute to dermatologic complaints.

3.1. Neuropathic itch

Neuropathic itch is a pathologic form of itch where the itch
sensation is either out of proportion to the pruritogenic stimulus
or present without any cutaneous stimulation at all. This form of
itch can be severe, difﬁcult to treat, and disabling to patients.

A variety of neurologic conditions affecting peripheral nerves
are associated with neuropathic itch (radicular nerve root com-
pression, shingles and other neurosensory ganglionopathies, small
ﬁber polyneuropathy, etc). Brain and spinal cord lesions (eg,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain abscess) have also been associated
with neuropathic itch [54]. In cases of CNS pathology, disruption of
normal nociceptive transmission is thought to result in distortion
of the stimulus-response curve and patients present with focal or
generalized pruritus [55].

In patients with primary CNS tumors, neurogenic pruritus is an
uncommon but reported ﬁnding. Four case reports describe three
pediatric patients and one adult who presented with isolated,
dermatomally localized neuropathic itch without neurologic def-
icit. In these patients, subsequent biopsy (n ¼ 3) or radiographic
diagnosis (n ¼ 1) of an intramedullary neoplasm was made
including one ganglioglioma, two pilocytic astrocytomas, and one
unspeciﬁcied intramedullary glioma [56–59]. In addition, systemic
lymphoproliferative malignancies which may inﬁltrate peripheral
nerves are associated with diffuse whole-body pruritus [60]. Thus
in rare cases of unexplained localized or diffuse pruritus without
etiologic explanation despite comprehensive evaluation, neuro-
logic workup is not unreasonable.

3.2. Brachioradial pruritus

Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a localized form of neuropathic
itch where patients present with unilateral or bilateral intense
itching, burning, tingling, or crawling sensation on the skin of the
arms. The most common distribution is the skin on the forearms
but can involve the entire arm. On skin exam there are no primary
lesions but many secondary ﬁndings of ecchymoses, linear excor-
iations, picker’s nodules, and scarring (Supplemental Fig. 2A). This
condition arises from disruption of C ﬁber sensory transmission
from pathology in the cervical spine. Cervical radiculopathy and
myelopathy are the most common neurologic association, and the
clinical presentation may be due to spinal cord tumors in rare
instances [61]. Many of these patients are diagnosed with eczema
or dry skin due to the lack of primary skin ﬁndings, but the
presence of signiﬁcant itching and burning out of proportion to
exam ﬁndings should alert the physician to the possibility of BRP.
Symptoms typically resolve with treatment of the underlying
cause of the cervical radiculopathy [62]. Other treatment options
include topical capsaicin, oral neuromodulating medications like
amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin, and physical therapy
[63].

3.3. Trigeminal trophic syndrome

Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is a rare but severely
disﬁguring form of localized neuropathic dysfunction affecting
patients with an insult to the trigeminal nerve. TTS typically
presents following trigeminal injury from diseases such as ische-
mic stroke, trauma, and trigeminal nerve ablation, but can also be
idiopathic and has been rarely reported in patients with brain
tumors [64–66]. Disruption of normal trigeminal nerve sensory
transmission results in severe pruritus, tingling, and pain. These
symptoms cause the patient to pick and mutilate the skin over-
lying the trigeminal nerve distribution. TTS presents as unilateral
non-healing ulcerations and linear excoriations affecting the nasal
ala, medial cheek, and forehead (Supplemental Fig. 2B). Often TTS
goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a herpetic infection, bacte-
rial infection, pyoderma gangrenosum, or cutaneous malignancy.
While uncommon, reports have described TTS in patients with
glioma, meningiomas and cranial nerve schwannomas, though in
these cases postoperative cranial neuropathy was also implicated
as a potential causative factor [66–69]. Treatment for TTS involves

patient education, treatment of underlying neurologic insult,
trigeminal nerve ablation, and topical barrier devices to prevent
picking behavior.

4. Cutaneous ﬁndings in patients with paraneoplastic
neurological syndromes

4.1. Dermatomyositis

Dermatomyositis is an inﬂammatory myopathy characterized
by photosensitive skin changes that coincide or precede the
development of proximal muscle weakness. Dermatologic mani-
festations include a violaceous discoloration of the upper eyelid,
called the heliotrope rash; erythema of the chest and upper back
called the “shawl sign”, and scaly erythematous papules overlying
the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints and elbows, termed
Gottron’s sign and papules [70]. Neurologically, proximal myopa-
thy often follows the onset of rash and features prominent limb-
and shoulder-girdle weakness typically accompanied by elevation
of serum creatinine kinase levels. Amyopathic variants have also
been described and underscore the importance of maintaining an
index of suspicion for neurologic manifestations when completing
dermatologic evaluation in these patients [71]. Many cases of
dermatomyositis represent a pure autoimmune inﬂammatory
condition; though multiple studies have suggested an increased
risk of solid organ malignancy in adults with dermatomyositis
supporting a paraneoplastic mechanism of disease in up to 25% of
cases [72–75]. In these cases, auto-reactive antigens expressed by
the tumor itself may give rise to an anti-tumor/anti-self immune
response that plays a role in the development of dermatomyositis
[76]. Though the number of testable myositis speciﬁc antibodies
has expanded rapidly in the last decade, none are known to be
speciﬁc for paraneoplastic dermatomyositis and clinicoradio-
graphic evaluation remains the primary methods of diagnosis
and surveillance.

5. Conclusion

Cutaneous ﬁndings are a rare but important clinical ﬁnding in
patients with tumors of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral
nerve. Skin features are most prominent in the genetic tumors
syndromes of NF1 and tuberous sclerosis but also should be
considered in the evaluation of other genetic nervous system
syndromes including NF2.
In patients with sporadic nervous
system tumors, the incidence of tumor-related cutaneous mani-
festations appears to be low. While treatment-related skin changes
have historically been uncommon with neuro-oncologic chemo-
therapeutics, the incidence is rising as targeted biologic agents are
investigated in these patients and may become important in future
clinical care. Dermatomyositis is a prototypical example of a
paraneoplastic neurological syndrome with prominent skin ﬁnd-
ings which precede neurologic dysfunction. Given the range of
these many cutaneous ﬁndings and the often multiple potential
explanations, a multidisciplinary approach to management with
collaboration across dermatology, oncology, and primary medicine
offers the optimal approach to the evaluation and management of
these patients.
