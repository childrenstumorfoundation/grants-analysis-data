The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) exerts oncogenic effects in
many tumour types1. However, loss-of-function mutations in PRC2
components occur in a subset of haematopoietic malignancies, sug-
gesting that this complex plays a dichotomous and poorly understood
role in cancer2,3. Here we provide genomic, cellular, and mouse mod-
elling data demonstrating that the polycomb group gene SUZ12func-
tions as tumour suppressor in PNS tumours, high-grade gliomas and
melanomas by cooperating with mutations in NF1. NF1 encodes a
Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and its loss drives cancer by
activating Ras4. We show thatSUZ12loss potentiates the effects ofNF1
mutations by amplifying Ras-driven transcription through effects on
chromatin. Importantly, however,SUZ12inactivation also triggers an
epigenetic switch that sensitizes these cancers to bromodomain inhib-
itors. Collectively, these studies not only reveal an unexpected con-
nection between the PRC2 complex,NF1and Ras, but also identify a
promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be exploited
for a variety of cancers.

The Ras pathway is commonly deregulated in cancer5. Oncogenic RAS
mutations occur in approximately 30% of tumours; however, mutations
in upstream regulators and downstream effectors are also prevalent5.
Irrespective of aetiology, the oncogenic Ras signal is frequently poten-
tiated as cancers progress, in some instances through amplification of
mutant RAS genes or suppression of negative feedback pathways6–9. It
is likely that many unknown mechanisms contribute to this emerging
aspect of tumour evolution.

Mutations in RasGAP genes promote Ras activation in many cancers4,10,11.
Defects in the NF1 RasGAP underlie a familial cancer syndrome (NF1),
sporadic glioblastomas (GBMs), neuroblastomas and lung cancer4. In-
terestingly, some severely affected patients with NF1 (NF1 microdele-
tion patients) carrygermlinedeletionsof NF1and13surrounding genes12,13.
These individuals develop thousands of benign tumours and can exhibit
a fourfold increased risk of malignancies14,15, suggesting that a cooperat-
ing tumour suppressor lies within this region. If true, this gene might
affect the development of tumours in patients with NF1 and in sporadic
cancers, which frequently possess large 17q deletions16. Therefore, we
analysed 51 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), the
most common NF1-associated malignancy, from patients with and with-
out an NF1 microdeletion. Array comparative genomic hybridization
revealed heterozygous and homozygous deletions of SUZ12, a gene with-
in the microdeletion, which encodes a component of the PRC2 (Fig. 1a,
Extended Data Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1). Deletions in EED,
another PRC2 component, were also prevalent in both populations.

Moreover, inactivating mutations in SUZ12 and EED were frequently
present (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Informa-
tion). Together, 79% of microdeletion and 34% of non-microdeletion
tumours exhibited homozygous loss of SUZ12 or EED; however, 53%
of non-microdeletion MPNSTs harboured one or more PRC2 muta-
tions/deletions (Fig. 1b). These observations suggest that PRC2 inac-
tivation may play a critical role in MPNST development.

SUZ12 and H3K27me3 were undetectable in primary MPNSTs har-
bouring SUZ12 mutations and in four NF1-deficient human MPNST
cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e and Fig. 1c). SUZ12 reconstitution
restored H3K27me3, reduced proliferation and triggered cell death in
low serum (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data 1f). The SUZ12 lentivirus did
not affect SUZ12 wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Conversely,
SUZ12 ablation enhanced colony growth of NF1-deficient (U251 (ref. 17))
but not NF1 wild-type GBM cells (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1h).
Partly effective short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) exerted a disproportion-
ate suppressive effect on H3K27Me3 and promoted colony growth of
U251 cells, albeit less efficiently (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that re-
duced PRC2 dosage might also contribute to tumour development,
which could be relevant in the setting of heterozygous SUZ12/EED
mutations (Fig. 1b). Finally, SUZ12 ablation enhanced colony growth
of NF1-deficient but not NF1 wild-type melanoma cells (Fig. 1f and
Extended Data Fig. 1i).

To assess the cooperativity of these genes further, Nf11/2; Suz121/2
‘cis’ mice, carrying mutations on the same chromosome, were generated
to recapitulate the genetics of microdeletion patients and spontaneous
tumours. Tumours in Nf1 mouse models are driven by spontaneous loss
of wild-type chromosome 11 (ref. 18), resulting in Nf1 and Suz12 loss
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). Nf11/2; Suz121/2 mice were highly tumour
prone and exhibited decreased survival (Fig. 2a). Notably, mice developed
lesions associated with both germline and spontaneous NF1 mutations in
humans, including neurofibromas, MPNSTs, schwannomas, melanocy-
tic nevi and intestinal adenomas (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b)4.
Genomic human tumour data demonstrate that at least one allele of NF1
and SUZ12 are co-deleted/mutated in 24% of melanomas (Fig. 2c).
Moreover, EED deletions/mutations are present in 44% of NF1-mutant
tumours, most of which also lack one SUZ12 allele.

To investigate SUZ12 in MPNST development further, mice harbour-
ing cis mutations in Nf1, p53 and Suz12 were also generated, as combined
NF1/p53 mutations drive MPNST formation18–20 (Supplementary Infor-
mation). These Nf1/p53/Suz12 mice exhibited decreased survival and
developed MPNSTs on average 2.3 months earlier than Nf1/p53 mutant

MPNSTs in Nf1/p53 mice required up to 9 months. Nevertheless, fewer
Nf1/p53/Suz12 animals developed MPNSTs, most probably because of the
increase in other tumour types (Fig. 2f). Strikingly, 54% of Nf1/p53/Suz12

mice developed high-grade gliomas and did so on average in approx-
imately 3 months, a latency shorter than most models (Fig. 2e, f and
Extended Data Fig. 2d). NF1 and SUZ12 were co-deleted/mutated in
14% of human GBMs (Fig. 2g). EED deletions were also detected in 26%
of NF1-mutant tumours, which all lacked a copy of SUZ12, highlighting
the co-occurrence of defects in NF1 and PRC2.

SUZ12 ablation causes a loss of H3K27me3 and in some settings
promotes a consequential increase in H3K27Ac21: a transcriptional activ-
ating signal that recruits bromodomain proteins and associated transcrip-
tion factors22. As such, we reasoned that SUZ12-mutant MPNSTs might
be sensitive to bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ123. Importantly, SUZ12
reconstitution increased H3K27me3 and decreased H3K27Ac in MPNST

cells, whereas SUZ12 ablation decreased H3K27me3 and increased
H3K27Ac (Fig. 3a). Moreover, SUZ12-deficient MPNSTs were more sen-
sitive to JQ1 than PRC2 wild-type cells (Fig. 3b).

Transcriptional profiling analysis was conducted in MPNSTs, in
the presence/absence of SUZ12 or JQ1. Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) and single-sample (ss)GSEA demonstrated that the gene set
suppressed by SUZ12 was also suppressed by JQ1 (Supplementary
Table 1 and Fig. 3c). Using the Molecular Signatures Database we found
that PRC2-regulated genes were suppressed both in SUZ12-reconstituted
and JQ1-treated cells, suggesting that JQ1 counteracts SUZ12 loss, in part,
by repressing PRC2 targets (Extended data Fig. 3a, b). Unlike other tumours,
neither JQ1 nor SUZ12 suppressed MYC genes (Extended Data Fig. 3c).
However, MYC genes are not upregulated and do not drive MPNST de-
velopment. Surprisingly, SUZ12 and JQ1 also suppressed genes associated
with oncogenic Ras transcriptional signatures (Fig. 3d and Extended Data
Fig. 3a). Conversely, Ras signatures were enhanced when SUZ12 was ablated
in NF1-mutant GBM cells (Fig. 3d). Phospho-ERK was unaffected by SUZ12
loss, reconstitution, or JQ1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3d), suggesting
that SUZ12 loss amplifies Ras transcriptional output via direct effects on
chromatin, and that JQ1 may counteract effects by suppressing Ras sig-
nature genes.

There are no effective therapies for MPNSTs24. While SUZ12-mutant
MPNSTs were sensitive to JQ1, in contrast to c-Myc driven tumours, the
effects were cytostatic25,26. Given the importance of Ras in MPNSTs, we
investigated whether JQ1 might cooperate with Ras pathway inhibitors.

LETTER RESEARCH

JQ1 was evaluated in combination with an mTOR inhibitor (rapamy-
cin), or a MEK inhibitor (PD-901) as both effectors function in NF1-
deficient tumours27–30. Only PD-901/JQ1 treatment killed MPNSTs
(Fig. 4a). Genetic ablation of BRD4 similarly cooperated with PD-901
(Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). SUZ12 suppression conferred sensitivity to
PD-901/JQ1 in other NF1-deficient tumour cells, including GBM and
colon cancer, whereas SUZ12 suppression did not affect NF1 wild-type
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Information).

To elucidate the cooperativity between BRD4 and MEK inhibitors,
transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were performed. We compiled a
list of publicly available upregulated Ras signature genes significantly
repressed by JQ1, PD-901 or JQ1/PD901 in MPNSTs (Supplementary
Table 2 and Supplementary Information). PD-901 suppressed a high
percentage (58%) of these Ras signature genes (Fig. 4b, blue boxes) and
JQ1 suppressed 29% (yellow boxes). However, JQ1/PD-901 cooperated
to suppress this Ras signature in several ways. Not only did JQ1 suppress
genes unaffected by PD-901, but the JQ1/PD-901 combination enhanced
or uniquely suppressed 26% of these genes (green boxes). ssGSEA of our
Ras signature gene set confirmed the cooperative effects of PD901 and
JQ1 (Fig. 4c). H3K27Ac and BRD4 were significantly enriched at pro-
moters of JQ1/PD-901 suppressed targets (Fig. 4b, red boxes) and BRD4
was displaced at 53% of sites (red boxes with dots), as shown in Fig. 4d.
Transcription factors including ETS1, a known master regulator of Ras-
driven transcription, were suppressed by JQ1/PD-901.

Finally, PD-901 and JQ1 were evaluated in Nf1/p53/Suz12 mice (Fig. 4e).
PD-901 did not affect MPNSTs, whereas JQ1 exerted modest, cyto-
static effects. However, combined JQ1/PD-901 triggered significant
tumour regression. On average, tumours shrank 67%; however, half
of them shrank by at least 75%. On the basis of their mechanism of de-
velopment, tumours from Nf1/p53 mice are SUZ12 heterozygous, reca-
pitulating an additional subset of human tumours (Fig. 1b). Consistent
with shRNA studies (Fig. 1e), tissue from Suz121/2 mice revealed a
disproportionate loss of H3K27me3 (Fig. 4f), potentially conferring
sensitivity to PD-901/JQ1. Indeed, Nf12/2;p532/2;Suz121/2 tumours
shrank up to 68% (Fig. 4g), albeit overall less than tumours in Nf1/p53/
Suz12 mice. Notably, H3K27me3 antibodies faithfully detected PRC2
defects in primary human tumours (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 4d and

Extended Data Table 1). Together, these studies reveal a promising
therapeutic strategy for MPNSTs, and suggest that PRC2 genetic alterations
or H3K27me3/H3K27Ac levels could be used as biomarkers for selec-
tion of patients.

While the PRC2 complex is oncogenic in many cancers, these stud-
ies reveal an important tumour-suppressive function for two PRC2
components in NF1-deficient solid tumours. Moreover, this complex
appears to function as a rheostat for Ras-dependent transcription. It is
becoming apparent that the oncogenic Ras signal is amplified as can-
cers progress. Because NF1-mutant tumours are driven by a relatively
weak oncogenic signal and lack an amplifiable mutant RAS allele, SUZ12
loss may be a particularly important mechanism of signal potentiation.
PRC2 inactivation may also enhance Ras-driven transcription in RAS-
mutant cancers. However, further studies will be required to assess this
possibility.

Additionally, these studies demonstrate that SUZ12 loss promotes
an epigenetic switch from H3K37Me3 to H3K27Ac, conferring sensitiv-
ity to BRD4 inhibitor-based combination therapies. Our data suggest that

Figure 4 | JQ1 and MEK inhibitors cooperate to promote cell death,
suppress Ras transcriptional output and promote tumour regression.

of microarray expression data evaluating the effects of the indicated drugs in
SUZ12/NF1 null cell line 90-8TL (Ras signature gene set: see Supplementary

yellow; PD901, blue; PD901/JQ1, black). Genes uniquely or more potently
suppressed by PD901/JQ1 are indicated in green. BRD4-bound genes are
indicated in red. H3K27Ac and BRD4 were significantly enriched at the
promoters of downregulated genes (compared with overall genes bound;
72% versus 46%, Fisher’s exact test, P 5 7.9 3 1023). A red box with black
square denotes a minimum fourfold displacement of BRD4 in response to
PD901/JQ1. H3K27Ac and BRD4 binding overlaps at 69/71 promoters.

Arrow depicts positive staining of blood vessel. An additional tumour set is
shown in Extended Data Fig. 4d, and results from all primary MPNSTs that
were evaluated are shown in Extended Data Table 1.

BRD4 inhibitors alone may not be effective in these tumours, but should
be evaluated in combination with MEK inhibitors. However, this work
may also have other important clinical implications. EZH2 inhibitors
have therapeutic potential in cancers with mutated or overexpressed
EZH2. Given the prevalence of SUZ12 and EED alterations, it may be
prudent to screen for these events in broader clinical trials, as EZH2
inhibitors could exacerbate potential pro-tumorigenic effects of hetero-
zygous alterations. Regardless, these studies reveal a mechanistic link
between Ras and PRC2, and provide a scientific rationale for developing
a new therapeutic combination for tumours that are currently untreatable.

METHODS
Human MPNST samples. All patients were diagnosed as having neurofibroma-
tosis type I. Consent was obtained for tissue acquisition according to Institutional
review board approved protocol and local ethical committees.
Cell lines and reagents. ST88-14 (J. Fletcher), 90-8TL (E. Legius), S462 (E. Legius),
SNF96.2 (ATCC), U251 (ATCC), A172 (ATCC), T98G (ATCC), MEWO (ATCC),
WM3526, Colo-741, RKO (ATCC), H460 (ATCC) and H1355 (ATCC) are human
MPNST, GBM, melanoma, colon and lung cancer cell lines. 702T is a mouse Nf1/
p53/Suz12-deficient MPNST cell line. All cell lines were tested and negative for myco-
plasma. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: H3K27Me3 (9733),
H3K27Ac (4353), pERK (XP, 4370) and Vinculin (4670) (Cell Signaling Technologies);
SUZ12 (sc-46264) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); actin (A2066) (Sigma). For ChIP-
seq, the following antibodies were used: BRD4 (Bethyl, A301-085A) and H3K27Ac
(Abcam ab4729).
Cell counting, IC50 and proliferation curves. All counting experiments were
done by haemocytometer. Cells were plated in triplicate for each condition (treatment
or genetic alteration). The following day the exact number of cells plated was deter-
mined (day 0 value) and cells were treated with conditioned media. The number of
cells was determined after 3 (normal growth conditions) or 6 (limiting growth factors)
days or precisely after three population doublings to determine values of IC50. Fold
growth or log2 of fold of the number of cells was determined versus day 0. When cell
death was induced (compared with the number of cells plated on day 0), data were
plotted as log2 of fold cell number (negative values indicate cell death). IC50 values and
95% confidence intervals were determined using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
Array comparative genomic hybridization. Array comparative genomic hybrid-
ization experiments (Agilent 244K and 400K) were performed as previously described20.
Array comparative genomic hybridization data (Agilent 244K) from 21 independ-
ent, high-grade MPNSTs (HM1, 2, 3, 5–8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22–26, 28, and 30)
were used as published previously20. Digestion, labelling and hybridization of tumour-
and patient- or gender-matched blood DNA were performed according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions (Agilent).
Sequencing. The coding sequences of 14 H3K27me3-related genes were analysed
(AEBP2, EED, EZH2, EZH1, HDAC2, JARID2, PCL1, PCL2, PCL3, RBBP4, RBBP7,
SIRT1, SUZ12 and UTX) using a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) ap-
proach. Experiments were performed on the NGS platform of the Cochin Hos-
pital, Paris (Assistance Publique, Hoˆpitaux de Paris, France). Briefly, the custom
primers panel targeting the 14 genes (coding exons and IVS boundaries) was
designed using the AmpliSeq Designer (Life Technologies). NGS library prepara-
tion used the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Ion AmpliSeq Library Preparation, publication part number MAN0006735,
revision 5.0, July 2013, Life Technologies). Amplified libraries were purified using
Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Prior to library pooling and se-
quencing sample preparation, amplified libraries were validated and quantified using
the 2100 Bioanalyzer microfluidic platform (Agilent Technologies). Emulsion PCR
used the Ion OneTouch Instrument. Enrichment of the template-positive Ion
OneTouch 200 ion sphere particle PCR used the Ion OneTouch ES (Life Tech-
nologies). The template-positive ion sphere particles were loaded on Ion 318 chips
and sequenced with an Ion PGM sequencer (Life Technologies). Sequence align-
ment and extraction of single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions/
deletions were performed using the Variant Caller plugin on the Ion Torrent
Browser, and DNA sequences visualized using the Integrated Genomics Viewer
(version 2.3) from the Broad Institute. NextGENe software (version 2.3.3, Soft-
genetics), was also used for sequence alignment, extraction of single nucleotide poly-
morphisms and short indels, and their visualization.
Real-time PCR. Cell were scraped and dissolved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA was treated with DNaseI (Roche) and reverse transcribed using the qScript
Reverse transcriptase kit (Quanta). Real-time PCR analysis used the PerfeCTa
SYBR Green kit (Quanta) for BRD4 (59-CATGGACATGAGCACAATCA-39 59-
TCATGGTCAGGAGGGTTGTA-39).
RNA interference and complementary DNA expression. Non-targeting short
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (D-001810-10: 59-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-39;
59-UGGUUUACAUGUUGUGUGA-39; 59-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCUGA-39;
59-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCCUA-39) and siRNAs against BRD4 (ON-TARGET
smartpool siRNA L-004937-00: 59-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-39; 59-UGGU
UUACAUGUUGUGUGA-39; 59-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCUGA-39; 59-UGGU
UUACAUGUUUUCCUA-39) were purchased from Dharmacon. siRNAs were tran-
sfected with lipofectamine RNAiMAX from Invitrogen. Lentiviral pLKO vectors were
obtained from the RNAi consortium of the Broad Institute. shSUZ12 S1 (NM_
015355.1-2076s1c1, target sequence 59- GCTGACAATCAAATGAATCAT-39), shSUZ12
S2 (NM_015355.1-668s1c1, target sequence 59GCTTACGTTTACTGGTTTCTT-39) and
shSUZ12 S3 (NM_015355.1-501s1c1, target sequence 59-CGGAATCTCATAGC
ACCAATA-39) were used to target SUZ12. Human SUZ12 (Open Biosystems) was

cloned into a pLenti CMV/TO Puro vector. Lentiviral infections were performed as
previously described28.
Expression micro-array and gene set enrichment analysis. The MPNST cell line
90-8TL was infected with LACZ control or SUZ12 and cultured for 14 days. The LACZ
expressing 90-8TL cell line was also treated with 100 nM JQ1, PD0325901 2 mM, a
combination of PD0325901 (2 mM) and JQ1 (100 nM) or vehicle (DMSO) for
24 h. Additionally SUZ12 was knocked down in the U251 cell line by shRNA. All
experiments were performed in triplicate. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) and purified using Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit (according to the
manufacturer’s instructions) and hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0
ST array by the Partners HealthCare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine core.
Analyses used BRB-ArrayTools developed by R. Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools
development team. Thresholds were set at P , 0.001. Supplementary Table 3 lists
all the genes significantly changed (P , 0.001) compared with control. We first made
a SUZ12 gene list of genes that were downregulated at least twofold (P , 0.001) in
SUZ12 reconstituted cells (Supplementary Table 1). GSEA31 and ssGSEA used the
Broad Institute interface (www.broadinstitute.com/gsea/index.jsp). Several gene lists
upregulated by Ras activation were significantly enriched in our experiments (BILD_
HRAS_ONCOGENIC_SIGNATURE, KRAS.300_UP.V1_UP, KRAS.600_UP.V1_UP,
KRAS.600.LUNG.BREAST_UP.V1_UP, KRAS.BREAST_UP.V1_UP). To identify more
specifically a subset of direct suppressive effects on the Ras pathway, we first compiled
these five significant gene lists and selected those genes that were significantly repressed
by JQ1, PD-901 or combined JQ1/PD901 in MPNSTs (Supplementary Table 2) (class
comparison of all treatments at P , 0.001).
ChIP-seq analysis. BRD4, H3K27Me3 and H3K27Ac were ChIPed following the
Agilent Mammalian ChIP-on-chip protocol. 90-8TL cells were grown and treated
under the same conditions as performed for microarray studies. Cells were cross-
linked for 15 min at room temperature by the addition of one-tenth of the volume
of 11% formaldehyde solution to the growth media. Pull down was performed with
the indicated antibodies and DNA was submitted for sequencing to the CCCB core
of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Alignment used the BWA package. Mapped tags were analysed using a statist-
ical method that fitted a Poisson distribution to the data and calculated a global
false discovery rate for peak detection. Peak calling used the HOMER software package
with the false discovery rate set to 0.001. Peak calling in this setting is differential be-
cause the algorithm requires that the number of tags mapped to an identified peak
region is fourfold higher in the test sample than the input sample. A background filter
was applied by analysing a 10 kilobase region surrounding each peak. Peaks were
removed unless tag density within each peak was at least fourfold higher than in the
surrounding region. Peaks were only called in regions of the genome that were not
masked by standard repeat element filters. Although repeat areas were removed,
some regions of the genome still had low mapability due to undetected repeats or
genome duplications. Accordingly, a final filter removed peaks in such poorly map-
pable regions. Differential peaks (comparing binding in different treatment groups)
were also determined by the HOMER package.
Mouse models and pathology. Animal procedures were approved by the Center
for Animal and Comparative Medicine in Harvard Medical School in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. c57bl/6 Nf11/2 (ref. 32) and Suz121/2 (ref. 33)
were crossed to generate double heterozygous mice. These mice were intercrossed
further to generate Nf11/2; Suz121/2 mice with both genes in a cis configuration.
Similarly Nf11/2; Suz121/2 mice were crossed to p531/2 mice to generate NPS mice
having Nf1, Suz12 and p53 mutations in cis on chromosome 11. For our survival
studies we used 15 animals in control groups and 30 animals in test groups. Relevant
tumour types were evaluated by a human pathologist (J.H.). The pathologist was
blinded to the group allocation.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. The tumours are composed of fasci-
cles of spindle cells with elongated, wavy nuclei, coarse chromatin and pale, eosino-
philic cytoplasm. Scattered tumour cells show marked pleomorphism, including
multinucleated forms. There are frequent mitotic figures.

High-grade glioma. The brain is infiltrated by a markedly hypercellular tumour
composed of rounded cells with hyperchromatic to vesicular nuclei and variably
prominent nucleoli, including occasional large and multinucleated cells.

Olfactory neuroblastoma. Tumours are composed of primitive polygonal cells
with vesicular chromatin, prominent, often multiple nucleoli, amphophilic cyto-
plasm and frequent mitotic figures. The tumour cells are arranged in sheets and
form numerous rosettes, and there is multifocal necrosis.

Melanocytic nevus. Heavily black-pigmented lesion (consistent with melanin).
The lesional cells are uniform with small nuclei and no nuclear atypia or mitotic
activity. The lesion is well circumscribed and does not infiltrate into adjacent tissues.
Intestinal adenoma. These dysplastic polyps (adenomas) show a tubular architec-
ture and are composed of columnar cells with enlarged and elongated, hyperchromatic
nuclei with prominent nucleoli and increased mitotic activity.

Drug treatment, dosing schedule and tumour volume measurements. Only
mice that developed an MPNST that was readily measurable by Vernier callipers
were included in the study. As these tumours develop spontaneously over time, and
to ensure adequate randomization, mice were sequentially enrolled per treatment
arm, starting with the combination treatment arm. The investigator was not blinded.
To have sufficient power (80%) to detect a minimum of 50% tumour shrinkage versus
day 0 (P 5 0.05), we enrolled six animals per treatment group. Mice were enrolled
in the study when tumour size reached 300–700 mm3. Tumour size was measured
every 2–3 days by Vernier callipers. Tumour volume was calculated using the stand-
ard formula L 3 W2 3 52. Tumour volume and log2 of fold growth versus day 0 were
calculated and plotted on a graph. JQ1 (45 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally
daily in a 10% (2-hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin solution (C0926, Sigma). PD-
0325901 was administered by oral gavage daily at 1.5 mg/kg (vehicle (0.5% (w/v)
methylcellulose solution with 0.2% (v/v) polysorbate 80 (Tween 80)). Compounds
given in combination were administered sequentially.

Statistics. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical analysis used SYSTAT 12 soft-
ware. For each data set, basic statistical values (mean and s.d.) were calculated and
normality determined (Shapiro–Wilk normality test); all data sets were normally
distributed. All fold change tumour volumes for the different drug combinations
were compared by Student’s t-test (unequal variance). Survival analysis used the
Mantel–Cox test. The statistical tests used are mentioned throughout the text.
