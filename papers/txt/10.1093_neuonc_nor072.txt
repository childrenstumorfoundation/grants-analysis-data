Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-domi-
nant disease that results in the formation of bilateral ves-
tibular schwannomas (VSs) and multiple meningiomas.
Treatment options
for NF2-associated tumors are

objectives of this study are (1) to test the efﬁcacy of
AR42, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, to inhibit
VS and meningioma growth and (2) to investigate this
drug’s mechanisms of action. Primary cultures of
human VS and meningioma cells were established.
Nf2-deﬁcient mouse schwannoma and benign human
meningioma Ben-Men-1 cells were also cultured. Cells
were treated with AR42, and the drug’s effects on pro-

used to evaluate the effects of AR42 on intracellular sig-
naling. The in vivo efﬁcacy of AR42 was investigated
using schwannoma xenografts. Tumor volumes were
quantiﬁed using high-ﬁeld, volumetric MRI, and mol-
ecular target analysis was performed using immunohis-
tochemistry. AR42 inhibited the growth of primary
human VS and Nf2-deﬁcient mouse schwannoma cells
with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
500 nM and 250 – 350 nM, respectively. AR42 also
inhibited primary meningioma cells and the benign
meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1, with IC50 values of
1.5 mM and 1.0 mM, respectively. AR42 treatment
induced cell-cycle arrest at G2 and apoptosis in both
VS and meningioma cells. Also, AR42 exposure
decreased phosphorylated Akt
in schwannoma and
meningioma cells. In vivo treatment with AR42 inhib-
ited the growth of schwannoma xenografts, induced
apoptosis, and decreased Akt activation. The potent
growth inhibitory activity of AR42 in schwannoma
and meningioma cells suggests that AR42 should be
further evaluated as a potential treatment for NF2-
associated tumors.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-

dominant disease caused by mutations in the
NF2 gene.1,2 Patients with NF2 develop mul-
tiple nervous system tumors; however, bilateral vestibu-
lar schwannomas (VSs) and multiple meningiomas are
most common. VSs develop from Schwann cells of the
vestibulocochlear nerve, and meningiomas originate

Meningiomas account
for approximately 20% of
primary intracranial tumors, and the World Health
Organization classiﬁes meningiomas
I
(benign) (80%), grade II (10 – 15%), and malignant
grade III tumors (1– 2%).3,5 – 7 While NF2 patients
develop both VSs and meningiomas synchronously,
these tumors can also occur sporadically in non-NF2
patients. In both scenarios, these tumors occur along
the skull base and cause hearing loss, tinnitus, cranial
nerve palsies, and balance dysfunction.8 – 12 When they
are large, NF2-associated tumors can compress the
brainstem,
in hydrocephalus, blindness,
stroke, and even death.13 Current treatment options
for VSs and meningiomas are surgical excision, stereo-
tactic radiation, and observation; however, no medical
options exist for afﬂicted patients. The ideal chemother-
apeutic agent would demonstrate efﬁcacy against both
tumor types and have minimal side effects.

in multiple tumor types, at least in part by inhibition of
the PI3K/Akt pathway.43 – 49 The objective of

AR42 on schwannomas and meningiomas and to deter-
mine whether treatment efﬁcacy correlates with Akt

Tissue Acquisition and Primary Cell Cultures

The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board
approved the protocols for human subjects in the acqui-
sition of fresh VS and meningioma specimens. The diag-
noses of these tumors were conﬁrmed by a clinical
neuropathologist. The excised tumor specimens were
placed in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and promptly transported to the laboratory.
Specimens were then minced into 1 – 3 mm sections
and dissociated with 0.6 U/mL collagenase (Serva) and
0.125 U/mL dispase (Invitrogen) for 3 –5 hours in a
378C humidiﬁed incubator. The dissociated tissue frag-
ments were then triturated, spun down, and plated
onto tissue culture-treated dishes (for meningiomas) or
onto dishes coated with poly-D-lysine–laminin (PDLL)
(for VS) in DMEM/10% FBS.

Immunoﬂuorescent staining was used to conﬁrm the
identity of our primary cultures. Cells plated on
chamber slides were ﬁxed for 30 min with freshly pre-
pared 2% paraformaldehyde. All antibody dilutions
were made in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with
10 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin and 1 mg/mL
saponin, and incubations were performed at room temp-
erature. VS cells were probed with S100 (1:1000,
#Z0311: Dako USA), and meningioma cells were
probed with epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)
(1:1000, clone E29 #M0613: Dako USA) (Fig. 1A).
After 2 hours, the cells were washed with PBS and incu-
bated for 1 hour with a 1:1000 dilution of either Oregon
Green– 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (S100) or Alexa
Fluor – 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (both from
Invitrogen). Cells were then washed with PBS and visu-
alized by epiﬂuorescence.

The purity of the cultures was also conﬁrmed with
light microscopy, and photomicrographs were taken
to document cell morphology and to conﬁrm the
absence of ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 1B). Small clumps of

Signaling Technology) was also used to conﬁrm equal
protein loading, and lysate from IOMM-Lee, an
NF2
malignant meningioma cell line, was used as
a positive control. Primary VS and meningioma cells
were found to be negative for merlin, with the excep-
tion of one primary meningioma culture, which was
weakly positive for merlin.

types were plated on uncoated dishes and grown in
DMEM/10% FBS.

MTS Assays

Cell proliferation was determined using the CellTiter 96
AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were plated at 4 × 103 cells per well in 96-well
plates. The following day, cells were treated with
AR42 at the indicated concentrations at 378C. After
72 hours, 20 mL of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) assay
solution was added to each well and incubated at 378C
for 1 to 4 hours. The amount of bioreduced formazan
produced was estimated by measuring the absorbance
at 490 nm. The percentage of cell proliferation was
plotted against concentrations of AR42, and the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated.
Cells were also examined by light microscopy to docu-
ment changes in cell morphology and density.

Westerns and Antibody Arrays

Subconﬂuent cells were treated with the indicated
amounts of AR42. To screen for potential drug-affected
signaling pathways,
the Human Phospho-Kinase
Proteome Proﬁler antibody array kit was used (R&D
Systems), using 300 mg of total protein per array mem-
brane. For immunoblotting, total cell lysates were har-
vested in ice-cold kinase lysis buffer (20 mM Tris,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ethylene glycol
tetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyr-
ophosphate, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂu-
oride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1x protease inhibi-
[Sigma], and 0.5 mg/mL pepstatin A
tor cocktail
[Roche]. Lysates were sonicated for 10 seconds, and the
total protein content was assayed using the microBCA
kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total cell lysates were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose
membranes. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies
against AKT (#9272), phosphoThr308-Akt (C31E5E,
#2965), phosphoSer473-Akt (D9E, #4060), stress-acti-
vated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK 56G8 (# 9258),
p-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185)
(#4671), glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (14C10, #2118) (all
from Cell Signaling Technology), and acetylated histone
H3 antibody (#06-599; Millipore).

Cell-Cycle Analysis

Primary tumor and Ben-Men-1 cells treated with the indi-
cated concentrations of AR42 for 2– 6 days were har-
vested by trypsinization. Floating and adherent cells
were collected, washed twice with cold PBS then ﬁxed
by dropwise addition of 1 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol
while vortexing. A propidium iodide (PI) solution

(50 mg/mL) containing RNase A (100 mg/mL) and
Triton X-100 (0.05%) was added to the samples, fol-
lowed by incubation for 30 to 60 min at 378C. Samples
were then ﬁltered to remove cell aggregates and analyzed
by FACS (ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting) Calibur
ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) after gating (FL2-A/
FL2-W) the diploid population. Data were analyzed
using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House)
with gating around the diploid population of cells.

cells (5 × 105 cells/mouse) resuspended in 0.2 mL of a
50% Matrigel solution (BD Biosciences) were injected
subcutaneously with an 18-gauge needle into the left
ﬂank of severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID)
mice (CB-17/Icr SCID from Charles River). On day 3
postinjection, the injected mice were then divided into
two groups: the ﬁrst (control) group of mice was fed
normal rodent chow (Harlan Teklad); and the second
group of mice was fed chow formulated to deliver
25 mg/kg AR42 daily (Research Diets). Forty-ﬁve days
after injection the mice were scanned by a high-bore
small-animal MRI, using a Bruker Biospin 94/30
magnet (Bruker Biospin). The respiration and tempera-
ture of the animals were monitored using the Small
Animal Monitoring and Gating system (Model 1025,
Small Animals Instruments). Axial T1-weighted (rep-
etition time [TR] ¼ 1500 ms, echo time [TE] ¼ 7.5 ms,
Rare Factor ¼ 4, navgs ¼ 4) and T2-weighted rapid
acquisition relaxation enhanced (RARE) images (TR ¼
4200 ms, TE ¼ 12 ms, Rare Factor ¼ 8, navgs ¼ 4)
were acquired contiguously over the entire region of
the tumor. The acquisition parameters for both the T1-
and T2-weighted multislice scans were as follows:
FOV ¼ 30 × 30 mm, slice thickness ¼ 1 mm, matrix
size ¼ 256 × 256. A region of

AR42 Inhibits the Proliferation of Schwannoma and
Meningioma Cells

Two mouse schwannoma cell lines (P0Cre;Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2
and mSchT), a malignant human schwannoma cell line
(HMS-97), and a benign meningioma cell
line
(Ben-Men-1) were used in the initial screen for the efﬁ-
cacy of AR42. Exposure of mouse schwannoma cell
lines (P0Cre;Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 and mSchT) to AR42 inhib-
ited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
(IC50 ¼ 250 nM) (Fig. 2A). AR42 treatment of primary
human VS cells from 3 different patients and HMS-97
human malignant schwannoma cells resulted in similar
growth inhibition with a mean IC50 of 500 nM and
350 nM, respectively (Fig. 2B). Meningioma cell pro-
liferation was also inhibited by AR42, although these
cells were
than schwannoma cells
(Fig. 2C). When primary human meningioma cells
from two different patients were treated with AR42,
an average IC50 of 1.5 mM was obtained. The IC50 for
the benign meningioma cell
line, Ben-Men-1, was
found to be about 1 mM. Both VS and meningioma
cells treated with AR42 also exhibited a dose-dependent
growth inhibition, as observed by light microscopy
(Figs 2D and E). These results indicate that AR42
potently inhibits both schwannoma and meningioma
cells.

remained constant in all samples. Since there have
been reports of HDAC inhibitors activating the JNK
pathway,42,54 we next validated that AR42 did not
modulate JNK (Fig. 3) using immunoblots. Again, in
line with our antibody array data, phosphorylated
and total
levels of JNK were unaffected by AR42
treatment (Fig. 4C). Then, to verify that AR42 inhib-
ited histone deacetylase, we probed western blots with
an antibody to acetylated histone H3. AR42 treatment
resulted in a dramatic increase in histone H3 acety-
lation for all cell types (Fig. 4D).

AR42 Induces G2 Arrest and Apoptosis in Schwannoma
and Meningioma Cells

To characterize the effect of AR42 exposure on the cell
cycle, ﬂow cytometry was performed using primary VS
and meningioma cells that had been exposed to varied
AR42 doses and treated for different durations. After 2
days of AR42 exposure, G2 arrest was induced in
primary VS cells, shifting the percentage of cells in G2
from 16% (control) to 23% (Fig. 5A). After drug treat-
ment, only a slight increase in the hypodiploid sub-G1
(apoptotic) fraction was observed. Varying the dose
while holding duration of treatment constant at 3 days
found a similar pattern of G2 arrest without any increase
in apoptotic fraction (Fig. 5B). Treatment duration was
then increased to 6 days to identify late treatment
effects on the cell cycle. With prolonged AR42 exposure
both G2 arrest and a moderate increase in apoptosis was
observed (Fig. 5C).

AR42 treatment of Ben-Men-1 cells showed increases
in apoptosis along with an increase in the G2/M fraction
(Fig. 5D). Similar results were observed in cells from two
different primary meningioma samples (Figs 5E and F).
Prolonged AR42 treatment resulted in a large increase
in the percentage of meningioma cells in the apoptotic
(sub-G1) fraction (Fig. 5G).

are
common, benign intracranial tumors that can cause
severe patient morbidity by virtue of
their critical
locations. For patients with NF2, multiple such tumors
occur synchronously and often recur following surgical
removal. Currently, no medical therapies are indicated
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
treatment of NF2-associated tumors;
the
development of low-toxicity chemotherapeutic agents
targeting VSs and meningiomas would be of great
beneﬁt. Some NF2 patients are already enrolling in off-
label, compassionate-use drug trials for FDA-approved
agents.55 – 57 For example, inhibitors of vascular endo-
thelial growth factor58 and ErbB/HER receptors57
have been used in pilot studies to treat NF2-associated
schwannomas; however, response rates have been incon-
sistent, side effects are signiﬁcant, long-term beneﬁts are
unclear, and these drugs have not been evaluated against
meningiomas. Moreover, strong preclinical data sup-
porting use of these drugs for NF2-associated tumors
is lacking. The current study demonstrates that AR42,
a novel HDACi, potently inhibits both schwannoma
and meningioma growth at doses that correlate with
Akt inactivation. These same IC50 doses cause G2/M
arrest and apoptosis in both cell types. Validation
studies in vivo demonstrate that AR42 inhibits schwan-
noma xenograft growth,
induces apoptosis, and
decreases activated Akt.

NF2-deﬁcient tumor cells have multiple deregulated

signal-regulated kinase), and Rac1/JNK.59 – 74 The
absence of merlin contributes to Akt activation seen in
schwannomas,32,33,35 and while the signaling pathways
involved in meningioma tumorigenesis may be more
complex,75 aberrant Akt activation has been a consistent
ﬁnding.18,74 Previous studies demonstrated that Akt inhi-
bition decreases VS cell growth and induces apoptosis
both in vitro and in vivo;19 also, investigators have
shown that targeting the PI3 –Akt– mTOR (mammalian
target of rapamycin) pathway in cultured meningioma
cells limits cell growth.75 Since Akt activation is
common to the pathogenesis of both VSs and meningio-
mas, we assessed whether efﬁcacious doses of AR42
inhibited Akt. Our ﬁnding demonstrated that AR42
treatment of both primary schwannoma and menin-
gioma cells consistently resulted in lower levels of Akt
phosphorylation, both in vitro and in vivo.

The literature suggests that two plausible mechanisms
may account for AR42-mediated decreases in p-Akt.
First, AR42 could alter total Akt levels, either by inhibit-
ing transcription/translation of the Akt gene or by desta-
bilizing Akt protein.46 The second possibility is that
AR42 activates an Akt-directed phosphatase that depho-
sphorylates Akt. Indeed, Chen et al. reported that
HDACs 1 and 6 bind to and inhibit protein phospa-
tase-1 (PP1); after HDACi addition, PP1 was liberated
from this inhibitory HDAC complex and could depho-
sphorylate Akt.43 Since we found no difference in total
Akt amounts after AR42 treatment in either schwanno-
mas or meningiomas, we propose that HDAC inter-
action with Akt may underlie our study’s observation
that efﬁcacious doses of Akt correlate with decreased
p-Akt.

Fig. 5. AR42 affects the cell cycle distribution of VS and meningioma cells. VS and meningioma cells were treated with AR42, as indicated.
Floating and adherent cells were collected and ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed using propidium
iodide labeling. VS treated for 2 days (A) and 3 days (B) with various doses of AR42 demonstrated a dose-dependent G2 arrest. AR42
treatment for 6 days resulted in G2 arrest and a moderate increase in apoptosis in VS cells (C). Ben-Men-1 cells (D) were treated with
various concentrations and exhibited a dose-dependent increase in G2 arrest and apoptosis. Primary human meningioma cells from two
different patients were treated for 3 days with 0.75 or 1.5 mM AR42 and showed similar increases in the G2 and sub-G1 fractions (E and
F). After 6 days, AR42-treated meningioma cells showed G2 arrest and a dramatic increase in apoptosis (G).

Rac1/JNK is deregulated in many glial and Schwann
cell tumors, making this a pathway of interest in NF2
research. Kaempfer et al. demonstrated that increases

in active Rac1 and JNK play a role in schwannoma pro-
gression as well as tumor cell dedifferentiation.60 By
activating apoptotic cascades,76 JNK sensitizes glioma

cells to apoptosis.77 The JNK pathway is a reported
target of HDACi in leukemia and glioma cells.42,78 Ras
can also activate JNK,79 and HDACi treatment can
induce apoptosis
in cells expressing constitutively
active K-RasV12.54 It is important to note, however,
that some HDACi’s do not act on the JNK pathway
and that this effect may be speciﬁc to both HDACi and
cell type. For example, Chen et al. demonstrated that
the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and SAHA (suberoy-
lanilide hydroxamic acid) preferentially promote depho-
sphorylation of Akt in malignant glioblastoma cells with
no effect on the JNK phosphorylation.43 To examine
these pathways in greater detail, we evaluated whether
the effects of AR42 may be due to modulation of total
JNK or p-JNK levels in NF2-associated tumors. Using
phospho-kinase arrays and Western blots, our in vitro
results found that AR42 treatment had no effect on
total JNK or p-JNK levels, suggesting that JNK signaling
does not play a signiﬁcant role in the antimitogenic
effects of AR42 in schwannomas and meningiomas.

Histone acetylation is critical to epigenetic modiﬁ-
cations occurring in many solid and hematological
tumors.80,81 Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge
on histone tails, thereby weakening interactions with
negatively charged DNA, creating a more “open” chro-
matin conformation and altering transcription of
growth-regulatory genes.35,36 Overexpressed or sus-
tained HDAC activity has been reported in leukemia,
lymphomas, and other types of cancers.21,27,35,36 The
aberrant HDAC activity in human neoplasms deacety-
lates the N-termini of core histones, resulting in a
tightly closed chromatin structure; therefore, tumor sup-
pressor genes can be silenced by abnormal HDAC
activity.
Inhibitors of HDACs reverse this histone

deacetylation, thus reactivating expression of silenced
genes.34 Acetylated histones, such H3 and H4, serve as
in vitro and in vivo markers for successful HDAC inhi-
bition.46 We found that AR42 strongly upregulated
acetylated histone H3 in treated VS and meningioma
cells. Although not the focus of the current study,
some of the observed antiproliferative effects of AR42
are likely due to these epigenetic modiﬁcations and
alterations in gene transcription. These effects are cur-
rently under investigation in our laboratory using
Affymetrix gene expression arrays and quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR.

the
Scriptaid, an HDACi, induced G1 arrest at low con-
centrations and G2 arrest in higher concentrations in

et al. examined the effect of AR42 on a series of
malignant mast cell
lines and found that AR42
caused G2 arrest in some cell lines but demonstrated
apoptosis in others.46 We found that AR42 treatment
of schwannoma and meningioma cells resulted in
dose-dependent G2 growth arrest in both cell types,
consistent with other reports using this inhibitor.43,46

however, this effect was more pronounced in menin-
gioma cells; VSs demonstrated a moderate increase
in apoptosis only after extended treatment (6 days).
Consistent with our in vitro data demonstrating that
AR42 inhibits schwannoma cell proliferation at doses
correlating with decreased p-Akt, our schwannoma
xenograft model found that AR42 exposure reduced

ﬂank of SCID mice as previously described.24 Xenograft-bearing mice were fed normal chow or AR42-containing chow formulated to deliver
25 mg/kg HDAC42 daily. The mice were weighed weekly and the amount of drug chow consumed was assessed weekly. Forty-ﬁve days
following the injection, the mice were examined with a 9.4 T/cm MRI scanner, and noncontrasted T1-weighted axial and coronal
images were obtained. Mice that had been fed AR42 had on average 42% smaller tumors compared with the control group (A). Tumor
histopathology revealed an increase in apoptotic bodies on hematoxylin–eosin staining (B) that was conﬁrmed by increased cleaved

steady-state oral dosing of schwannoma xenograft-
bearing mice for 45 days found robust evidence of
apoptosis. Histologic analysis of hematoxylin-eosin
sections from AR42-treated tumors revealed apoptotic

bodies, and TUNEL staining and anticleaved caspase-3
antibody found increased staining throughout all
treated specimens. These results demonstrate that the
effect of AR42 may be cell type-dependent and may
also depend on dose and duration of treatment. This

the

ﬁnding underscores
importance of validating
in vitro drug mechanism studies using in vivo results.
This is particularly relevant to the human condition
in that oral dosing of AR42 likely results in steady
drug levels
for days or perhaps even weeks of
treatment.

Our study ﬁndings are consistent with results from
other investigators demonstrating that the in vivo efﬁ-
cacy of AR42 treatment correlates with suppression of
Akt activation.45,46,49,83 For example, AR42 suppressed
PC-3 prostate cancer xenograft growth by reducing
phospho-Akt as well as activating the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway.45 More than a dozen HDAC inhibitors are
now being investigated in phase I/II clinical trials for
solid and hematological tumors, with some showing efﬁ-
cacy and low pharmacotoxicity.21,27,35,36,84 Due to its
high potency against NF2-associated tumors through
inhibitory effects on Akt, AR42 is a promising candidate
for the treatment of VSs and meningiomas.

Conclusion

AR42 is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor that
potently reduces VS and meningioma proliferation.
This growth suppression correlates with decreased Akt
phosphorylation and G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
induction. Consistently, in vivo treatment with AR42
inhibited the growth of
schwannoma xenografts,
induced apoptosis, and decreased activated Akt.
Further validation of this novel small-molecule inhibitor
