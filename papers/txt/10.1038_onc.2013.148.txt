REVIEW
The molecular and cell biology of pediatric low-grade gliomas

Y-H Chen and DH Gutmann

Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common glial cell tumor arising in children. Sporadic cases are associated with KIAA1549:BRAF
fusion rearrangements, while 15–20% of children develop PA in the context of the neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) inherited tumor
predisposition syndrome. The unique predilection of these tumors to form within the optic pathway and brainstem (NF1-PA) and
cerebellum (sporadic PA) raises the possibility that gliomagenesis requires more than biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor
suppressor gene or expression of the KIAA1549:BRAF transcript. Several etiologic explanations include differential susceptibilities of
preneoplastic neuroglial cell types in different brain regions to these glioma-causing genetic changes, contributions from non-
neoplastic cells and signals in the tumor microenvironment, and genomic modiﬁers that confer glioma risk. As clinically-faithful
rodent models of sporadic PA are currently under development, Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models have served as
tractable systems to study the role of the cell of origin, deregulated intracellular signaling, non-neoplastic cells in the tumor
microenvironment and genomic modiﬁers in gliomagenesis. In this report, we highlight advances in Nf1-GEM modeling and review
new experimental evidence that supports the emerging concept that Nf1- and KIAA1549:BRAF-induced gliomas arise from speciﬁc
cell types in particular brain locations.

INTRODUCTION
Tumors of the nervous system are the leading cause of cancer-
related death in children. Among the various histological
subtypes,
in the pediatric
population is the WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma (PA).1,2
These low-grade PAs are characterized by glial ﬁbrillary acid
protein (GFAP) expression and unique histologic features,
including eosinophilic granular bodies and Rosenthal ﬁbers.3
Unlike their more malignant counterparts, they lack palisading
necrosis, high mitotic indices or pronounced nuclear atypia.
However, PAs may exhibit prominent microvascular proliferation
and harbor large numbers of microglia. In addition, in distinction
to adult gliomas, PAs most commonly arise in the optic pathway,
brainstem and cerebellum.

Until recently, the only known genetic alteration associated with
PA was mutational inactivation of neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) tumor
suppressor gene in children with the NF1 inherited tumor
predisposition syndrome.4,5 In these NF1-associated gliomas,
biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene was observed, concomitant
with the loss of NF1 protein (neuroﬁbromin) expression.4,6 In the
context of NF1, PAs predominate in the optic pathway (optic
nerve, chiasm and post-chiasmatic radiations) in children younger
than 7 years of age (Figures 1a and b).7 While 75% of NF1-PAs are
located within the optic pathway, 15–20% of these gliomas may
also arise in the brainstem.8

In contrast to NF1-associated PA, sporadic PAs usually arise in
the cerebellum (Figures 1c and d), but may also be located, with
decreasing frequency, in the brainstem and optic pathway. When
they form in the cerebellum, there is frequently a prominent cystic
component, and surgical
resection is usually curative. While
NF1 loss is not found in sporadic PAs,5,9 converging evidence
from numerous laboratories has revealed that the majority of

non-NF1-associated PAs harbor a somatic rearrangement, in which
the kinase domain of the BRAF gene is fused to an unknown
gene (KIAA1549). This fusion event (KIAA1549:BRAF or f-BRAF)
is most commonly detected in sporadic PAs arising in the
cerebellum.4,5,10,11

The fact that these tumors do not progress to higher grade glial
malignancies and exhibit a geographical predilection for speciﬁc
midline brain regions raises the intriguing possibility that pediatric
PAs are neurodevelopmental disorders. Similar to other neuro-
developmental diseases, these low-grade gliomas in children likely
obey the rules that govern normal patterning in the developing
central nervous system.
In this review, we will discuss recent
studies that collectively support a model
in which pediatric
gliomagenesis requires the conﬂuence of numerous critical
conditions that
reﬂect activation of speciﬁc growth control
pathways, the cell of origin, brain region-speciﬁc constraints and
the local microenvironment.

GROWTH CONTROL PATHWAYS
With the identiﬁcation of the NF1 gene and f-BRAF fusion event, it
now becomes possible to determine how PA growth is regulated.
The NF1 gene product, neuroﬁbromin is a large cytoplasmic
protein (220–250 kDa) that contains three differentially-spliced
exons (9a, 23a and 48a)12 (Figure 2a). While the precise function

reducing RAS-mediated growth signaling.18–20 In this respect, loss
of neuroﬁbromin expression results in increased RAS activity.20,21
Recently, array-based comparative genomic hybridization
identiﬁed a low-level copy number gain of the BRAF gene in a
large portion of PAs.11,22 Further studies demonstrated that this
gain was due to a tandem duplication at 7q34 with subsequent
fusion between the 50 end of the KIAA1549 gene and the 30 end of
the BRAF gene (Figure 2b).10,11,22,23 The resulting fusion transcripts
contain the amino terminus of the KIAA1549 protein and the BRAF
kinase domain, but lack the auto-regulatory domain of BRAF,
resulting in constitutive BRAF kinase activity and downstream
activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
pathway. In addition to KIAA1549:BRAF, other somatic mutations
have also been reported in PA, including rare oncogenic Ras or

In many cell types, RAS activation leads to increased signaling
through RAS downstream effector proteins, including PI3-Kinase
(PI3K)/AKT and RAF/MEK (Figure 3). To deﬁne how neuroﬁbromin

regulates glial cell proliferation downstream of RAS,
a proteomic approach was utilized. Using wild-type and
Nf1-deﬁcient mouse brain astrocytes, mass spectrometry revealed
increased expression of ribosomal proteins involved in protein
translation following neuroﬁbromin loss.30 As predicted from the

conferred by f-BRAF expression, recent studies have demonstrated
that MEK activation converges on a pathway shared with NF1-PA.
In cerebellar NSCs expressing f-BRAF,
increased MEK activation
leads to mTOR hyperactivation (Figure 3). While Nf1 loss in
astrocytes activates mTOR in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner,33
f-BRAF expression in these NSCs results in increased mTOR
activation by phosphorylation and inactivation of the tuberous
sclerosis complex-2 protein (tuberin), leading to elevated Rheb-
mediated mTOR signaling.34 These exciting ﬁndings suggest that
mTOR might be a central target for both sporadic and NF1-
associated PA, and have prompted recent clinical studies using
rapamycin analogs to treat these tumors.

CELL OF ORIGIN
Studies on malignant brain tumors, as well as other central
nervous system tumor types (ependymoma, medulloblastoma
(MB), meningioma) have demonstrated that the cell of origin and
developmental stage matter greatly in the genesis of these
cancers.35–38 For example, intracranial and spinal ependymomas
likely arise from radial glial cells,38 which function as NSCs in the
embryo and give rise to adult NSCs.39 Further evidence has
revealed that
Ink4a/Arf-/- NSCs with ampliﬁed EPHB2 from
the embryonic cerebrum, but not from other regions or from
form ependymomas resembling human supratentorial
adults,
ependymoma.40
subgroups of MB are
characterized by activation of different signaling pathways,
including sonic hedgehog and WNT.41 While the desmoplastic
subtype of MB harboring mutations in the sonic hedgehog
pathway likely arises from granule neuron precursors,42 the classic
subtype with aberrant WNT pathway signaling derives from
mossy-ﬁber neuronal precursors in the dorsal brainstem.36

Similarly, distinct

(SVZ) NSCs35,43

The cell of origin for malignant glioma remains controversial, as
these cancers can arise from numerous cell
ranging
from lateral
and
NG2 þ progenitors44–48 to mature astrocytes and neurons.49,50
For example, conditional inactivation of Tp53, Nf1 and Pten tumor
suppressor genes in mouse SVZ NSCs can induce malignant
astrocytomas.35,43 In contrast, introducing platelet-derived growth
factor into adult mouse white matter, tumor-initiating NG2 þ /
GFAP   progenitor cells recruits/activates other progenitors to
promote malignant glioma.47 Similarly, other
studies have
suggested that more differentiated glial cell types (astrocytes)
might directly transform into glioma.49 Even more surprising is the
recent report that mature neurons can undergo dedifferentiation
in response to glioma-associated genetic changes to create a
progenitor state sufﬁcient to initiate glioma formation.50

Genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models have provided
powerful
instructive tools to study the cellular origins of brain
tumors. While Parada and colleagues have demonstrated that
malignant gliomas arise following biallelic Nf1 and Tp53 inactiva-
tion in NSCs within the lateral ventricle germinal zone,35 the cells
from which Nf1 low-grade gliomas arise has proven more elusive.
Using a series of Cre driver lines to conditionally inactivate the Nf1
tumor suppressor gene in several potential progenitor cell types at
various times during development, recent studies have revealed
that Nf1 mouse optic gliomas most likely arise from neuroglial
progenitors within the germinal layer of the third ventricle (TVZ).
In these experiments, Nf1þ /  mice in which the Nf1 gene was
inactivated in NG2 þ progenitors did not develop brain tumors,
excluding this cell type as the cell of origin for optic glioma.51
Similarly, Nf1þ /  mice in which the Nf1 gene was inactivated in
postnatal GFAP þ astrocytes did not
form gliomas:52 Only
Nf1þ /  mice in which Nf1 gene inactivation occurred between
in GFAP þ
11.5 and 16.5 days of embryonic development
neuroglial progenitors developed optic gliomas.52 As both the
lateral and TVZ contain neuroglial progenitors, it is possible that

operates as a tumor suppressor protein by accelerating the
conversion of the RAS proto-oncogene from its active, GTP-bound
state to its inactive, GDP-bound state. Loss of neuroﬁbromin

RAS-GTP levels and hyperactivation of downstream RAS signaling
pathways,

following neuroﬁbromin loss leads to high levels of MEK/ERK and

Subsequent
experiments demonstrated mTOR hyperactivation in Nf1 mouse
optic glioma and NF1-associated human PA tumors. In addition, a
previous study showed that loss of neuroﬁbromin expression was
associated with PI3K-AKT signaling pathway activation in a single
human NF1-associated PA.6 The importance of PI3K/AKT and
mTOR pathway activation to neuroﬁbromin growth regulation in
astrocytes and neural stem cells (NSCs) was further conﬁrmed by
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTOR function in Nf1-
deﬁcient astrocytes.30,31 Relevant to the treatment of NF1-PA,
treatment of Nf1-deﬁcient astrocytes with the mTOR inhibitor,
rapamycin, reduced their proliferation to wild-type levels and
attenuated glioma growth in a mouse model of Nf1 optic
glioma.32

In contrast, deregulated BRAF activity is thought to increase cell
growth in a MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent
manner. While MEK inhibition ameliorates the growth advantage

stem cell populations.52 Moreover,

Subsequent transcriptomal analyses revealed that NSCs from
the TVZ and those from the lateral ventricle SVZ represent two
molecularly-distinct
the
observation that TVZ NSCs, but not their lateral ventricle-SVZ
counterparts, exhibit increased proliferation in vitro and increased
glial differentiation in vivo following Nf1 gene inactivation
demonstrates that murine Nf1 optic gliomas most likely arise
from neuroglial progenitors
residing within the TVZ. This
conclusion is further supported by previous studies of human
optic glioma, demonstrating that a discrete population of GFAP-
positive radial glial cells extends bilaterally from the ﬂoor of the
TVZ to the optic nerve.53

Unlike Nf1 low-grade optic glioma, experimental mouse models
for
f-BRAF-associated sporadic PA are currently unavailable.
Several studies have shown that ectopic expression of either
constitutively-activated RAF-1 or BRAFV600E alone is not sufﬁcient
to induce gliomas in mice, suggesting that an activated BRAF
mutation alone may not be an oncogenic driver.54–56 However,
RAF-1 and BRAFV600E mutations are rare mutations in PA relative to
the signature f-BRAF genetic alteration.57 Using the most common
f-BRAF genetic alteration (KIAA1549ex16-BRAFex9), recent studies
have revealed similar cell of origin effects.34 While ectopic f-BRAF
expression increases cerebellar mouse NSC proliferation, it has no
effect on primary mouse astrocyte growth in vitro.
In addition,
mice transplanted with f-BRAF-expressing cerebellar NSCs develop
low-grade glioma-like lesions within the cerebellum in vivo.
While deregulated BRAF activity leads to increased proliferation
in mouse NSCs, other studies have indicated that this effect is
transient, and is followed by oncogene-induced senescence in
human PA-associated glioma stem cells.58,59 Collectively, these
results underscore the importance of cellular context and
developmental age as important determinants of
low-grade
glioma tumorigenesis.

BRAIN REGION
While malignant gliomas can arise in nearly any location within
the central nervous system, glial cell tumors (astrocytomas or
gliomas) are most
frequently observed in the cerebellum,
brainstem and optic pathway/hypothalamus in children.3 An
association between genetic mutation and tumor location is one
of the earliest recognized features in low-grade gliomas. Somatic
BRAF rearrangement is speciﬁc to sporadic PAs and more frequent
in cerebellar, but rare in supratentorial hemispheric, PAs.
In
contrast, NF1-associated PAs are mainly seen in the optic pathway
and brainstem, but uncommonly arise in the cerebellum or
cortex.22,57,60,61

for

Although the molecular bases

these region-speciﬁc
distributions have not been fully elucidated, one key determinant
could be cell-intrinsic responses to speciﬁc glioma-associated
genetic alterations. Previous studies from PAs and another glial
neoplasm (ependymoma) have suggested that glial tumors of the
same histological types often comprise clinically and molecularly-
distinct subgroups retaining speciﬁc signatures that reﬂect their
respective brain regions of origin.38,40,62 In this regard, astrocytes
from different brain regions (brainstem, optic nerve, cerebellum
and neocortex) harbor unique gene expression signatures.63 One
of
in mouse neocortical
astrocytes relative to all other astrocyte populations was the Nf1
tumor suppressor gene. Consistent with signiﬁcantly lower levels
of neuroﬁbromin, loss of Nf1 expression in cortical astrocytes had
no effect on cell proliferation in vitro, whereas Nf1 loss in optic
nerve, cerebellar and brainstem astrocytes resulted in increased
proliferation.63 Similarly, mouse NSCs from the brainstem exhibit
increased proliferation and gliogenesis following Nf1 inactivation,
whereas neocortical NSCs did not.31 Unlike the situation with

the differentially-expressed genes

astrocytes, this differential response to Nf1 loss was not the
consequence of reduced neuroﬁbromin expression, but rather
resulted from differential expression of the mTOR component
rictor.31 In brainstem NSCs, which express ﬁvefold more rictor
relative to cortical NSCs, Nf1 loss results in increased mTORC2-
mediated Akt activation and p27 degradation, and leads to
enhanced NSC proliferation and glial differentiation.

Similar to NF1, brain region heterogeneity also contributes to
the patterning of sporadic f-BRAF-associated PA. While NSCs from

LOCAL MICROENVIRONMENT
In order to recapitulate NF1-associated gliomagenesis in mice, it is
necessary to inactivate both copies of the Nf1 gene in astroglial
progenitor cells. As conventional Nf1 knockout (Nf1  /  ) mice
are embryonic lethal,64,65 mice in which the Nf1 gene was
conditionally inactivated in speciﬁc
cell populations were
generated
Surprisingly,
conditional knockout mice with complete loss of neuroﬁbromin
expression in GFAP þ astroglial progenitor cells did not develop
brain tumors, suggesting that other factors are required for
tumorigenesis.
As children with NF1 start life with one functional and one non-
functional NF1 gene in every cell of their bodies (NF1þ / 
humans), Nf1þ /  mice were employed to generate Nf1þ / 
mice lacking Nf1 expression in astroglial progenitor cells. Using
two independent GFAP-Cre driver strains to inactivate the Nf1
gene in neuroglial progenitors during embryogenesis, the majority
of Nf1þ /  mice with astroglial Nf1 loss (Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice)
develop optic gliomas.68 These unexpected ﬁndings suggested
that Nf1 optic gliomagenesis requires coupling of complete Nf1
loss in neuroglial progenitors with reduced Nf1 gene expression in
non-neoplastic cells. Moreover,
it argues that non-neoplastic
Nf1þ /  stromal cells are required for Nf1 optic glioma formation.
Previous studies have shown that endothelial cells, reactive
astrocytes and microglia (macrophage-like immune system cells)
are among the many non-cancerous cells capable of producing
growth factors that increase preneoplastic and neoplastic cell
growth.35,69,70 Although the other stromal cell types are likely
important for creating a permissive microenvironment for glioma
formation and continued growth, subsequent studies focused on
microglia, based on their abundance in human sporadic and NF1-
associated PA.71,72 In this respect, microglia comprise 30–50% of
the total number of cells in these tumors, and have been
implicated in the maintenance of brain homeostasis,
including
neuronal survival,73 synaptic function74,75 and neurotrophic factor
production.76 In addition, reactive gliosis in response to injury is
partially dependent on microglia/macrophage-induced sonic
hedgehog activation in astrocytes,77 raising the possibility that
microglia promote both reactive gliosis and endothelial cell
proliferation.78
increased numbers of
microglia were found in Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mouse optic nerves
before obvious optic glioma formation.71 Moreover, Nf1þ / 
microglia, but not wild-type microglia, increase the proliferation of
Nf1  /  astrocytes in a paracrine fashion in vitro.79 Additional

inhibition studies.79–81 First, treatment of Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice
with minocycline to impair microglia function results in reduced
optic glioma tumor proliferation. Second, Nf1þ /  microglia
(but not Nf1-deﬁcient astrocytes) exhibit increased JNK activation,
such that pharmacologic

Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice attenuates tumor cell proliferation. Third,
genetically reducing microglia following gancyclovir-mediated
death in Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice expressing the thymidine kinase
gene in monocytes (CD11b-TK mice) reduces optic glioma tumor
proliferation.

JNK inhibition of microglia

To determine whether microglia are required for optic
gliomagenesis, recent work has employed mice with impaired
fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) expression.82 CX3CR1 is expressed in
resident brain microglia and partly drives microglia inﬁltration and
function in response to chemokines.82,83 Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice
develop optic glioma by 2–3 months of age,67,71 while mice in
which one Cx3cr1 allele was silenced (Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO-CX3CR1
mice) have reduced numbers of optic nerve microglia at 6 weeks
and 3 months of age and no evidence of glioma.84 However, by 4
months of age, the numbers of microglia have normalized and
optic gliomas are now evident,
further underscoring the
importance of these stromal cell types in both glioma formation
and maintenance.

The notion that neoplastic glial cells release soluble factors
(stromagens) that recruit or activate microglia, which in turn
produce additional tumor-promoting molecules (gliomagens) to
increase the proliferation, survival and invasion of neoplastic cells
has recently gained traction (Figure 4).85–88 One of these potential
gliomagens is the stroma-derived growth factor CXCL12, a ligand
for the CXCR4 and CXCR7 chemokine receptors.89 First, high levels
of CXCL12 are found in young children and mice along the optic
pathway, but not in adults.90 Second, Nf1þ /  microglia produce
high levels of CXCL12 relative to their wild-type counterparts.
Third, CXCL12 increases the survival of Nf1-deﬁcient astrocytes,

progenitors release factors (stromagens) that recruit or activate
microglia, as well as other stromal cell types (endothelial cells and
reactive astrocytes). Non-neoplastic stromal cells in turn elaborate
gliomagens to create a supportive niche that facilitates the growth
and expansion of preneoplastic/neoplastic neuroglial progenitors.
The glioma tumor microenvironment is established by interactions
between preneoplastic/neoplastic and non-neoplastic stromal cell
populations, which together promote gliomagenesis and tumor
progression.

Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO
mice with the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, Rolipram,
elevates cAMP levels by blocking cAMP degradation, and
attenuates Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth in vivo.93 Conversely,
lentiviral delivery of phosphodiesterase-4 into the forebrains of
Nf1þ /  GFAPCKO mice locally lowers cAMP levels, and results in
ectopic glioma formation in some mice.93 These ﬁndings argue
that CXCL12 is one critical stromal determinant

for dictating NF1-associated gliomagenesis.

GEM strains harboring heterozygous mutations in both the Nf1

modiﬁers in gliomagenesis. In these studies, they have shown that
gliomas form at a higher frequency on the inbred C57BL/6J (B6)
genetic background relative to the 129S4/SvJae (129) background.
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that B6 alleles on
mouse chromosome 11 were found to confer this dominant
susceptibility.98 Subsequent studies have identiﬁed other modiﬁer
loci on mouse chromosomes 5 and 12.99,100 Collectively,
these ﬁndings establish that
the existence of epigenetic or
polymorphic differences that modify the susceptibility of mice to
gliomagenesis, and raise the intriguing possibility that similar loci
exist in children with NF1 that likewise predispose them to glioma
development.

CONCLUSIONS
There are a number of clinical challenges to the management of
patients with PA. Surgical resection is considered the treatment of
choice in children, and usually results in excellent long-term
survival rates.101,102 Unfortunately, a signiﬁcant number of these
gliomas (for example, NF1-PA) involve the optic pathway or deep
midline structures, and are not amenable to complete resection.
For these tumors, nonsurgical strategies, including chemotherapy
and radiation therapy, are usually implemented. However,
radiotherapy is not recommended for the treatment of NF1-
associated optic gliomas, as children with NF1 have a propensity
to develop secondary central nervous system tumors following
radiation,103 as well as signiﬁcant long-term neurocognitive and
endocrine impairments, which may not be obvious for 5–10 years
following the completion of treatment.101,104

Molecular pathogenesis of pilocytic astrocytomas
Y-H Chen and DH Gutmann

Although Nf1 inactivation in glial lineage cells is a necessary step
in oncogenesis, it must occur in a speciﬁc susceptive cell type
capable of expanding in response to loss of neuroﬁbromin growth
regulation. Moreover, glioma formation in children with NF1 is
further restricted by developmental constraints, brain region-
speciﬁc determinants, patient age, genomic background and the
presence of a supportive local microenvironment (Figure 5). The
fact that there exist a number of conditions that must be met in
order for gliomagenesis to occur may partly explain why the
majority of children with NF1 do not develop brain tumors.
In
addition, each of these factors not only inﬂuences tumorigenesis,
but also glioma behavior (vision loss, progression) and perhaps
response to therapy. With the availability of an emerging number
of potential preclinical GEM glioma models,
it now becomes
possible to identify and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies
that leverage these unique requirements and conditions.

Although less is known about the conditions that dictate f-BRAF-
associated glioma formation and growth, it is highly likely that
some of the same rules that govern NF1-PA biology are applicable
to their sporadic counterparts. The potential for shared lessons is
underscored by the ﬁnding that mTOR activation is a signature of
both sporadic and NF1-associated PA. In this regard, future studies

Figure 5. Pediatric gliomas are deﬁned by numerous conditions.
Pediatric glioma formation requires that cancer-causing genetic
mutations occur in speciﬁc susceptible preneoplastic cells (glial cells
or stem cells) within particular brain regions. The local micro-
environment is highly inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc brain region, as well
as genomic factors (patient sex, genomic modiﬁers). Moreover, the
dynamic relationship between preneoplastic/neoplastic neuroglial
and non-neoplastic stromal cells is also impacted by the patient age
and genomic modiﬁers. Distinct subgroups of patients with low-
grade glioma could reﬂect their unique clinicopathological features
such as the cell of origin, brain region, stromal factors or genomic
modiﬁers. Each of these subgroups of children may have different
clinical outcomes and responses to conventional or
targeted
therapy.

focused on understanding the interplay of all of these molecular
and cellular determinants may facilitate the design of more
efﬁcient strategies to treat these low-grade brain tumors without
negatively impacting on the developing brain. Moreover,
it is
equally plausible that further elucidation of these constraints and
conditions will reveal predictive modiﬁers of glioma behavior.
Recent clinical studies have shown that girls with NF1 younger
than 2 years of age harboring gliomas involving the post-
chiasmatic optic radiations are more likely to behave in a
clinically-aggressive manner.105 Future clinical studies coupled
with basic science investigation and genomic analyses may one
day yield a series of predictive biomarkers that allow clinicians to
stratify children with low-grade gliomas into clinically-relevant
groups for surveillance and potential targeted treatment.
