Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients develop benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve 
sheath tumors (MPNST). These incurable peripheral nerve tumors result from loss of NF1 tumor suppressor 
gene function, causing hyperactive Ras signaling. Activated Ras controls numerous downstream effectors, but 
specific pathways mediating the effects of hyperactive Ras in NF1 tumors are unknown. We performed cross-
species transcriptome analyses of mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNSTs and identified global nega-
tive feedback of genes that regulate Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in both species. Nonetheless, ERK activation 
was sustained in mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNST. We used a highly selective pharmacological 
inhibitor of MEK, PD0325901, to test whether sustained Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling contributes to neurofi-
broma growth in a neurofibromatosis mouse model (Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre) or in NF1 patient MPNST cell xenografts. 
PD0325901 treatment reduced aberrantly proliferating cells in neurofibroma and MPNST, prolonged survival 
of mice implanted with human MPNST cells, and shrank neurofibromas in more than 80% of mice tested. Our 
data demonstrate that deregulated Ras/ERK signaling is critical for the growth of NF1 peripheral nerve tumors 
and provide a strong rationale for testing MEK inhibitors in NF1 clinical trials.

Introduction
The hallmark manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) 
is the development of peripheral nerve tumors (1). In benign and 
malignant peripheral nerve tumors, cells acquire somatic inacti-
vation of the second NF1 allele and loss of NF1 (neurofibromin) 
protein function (2). With few exceptions, NF1 patients develop 
small benign dermal neurofibromas that can number into the 
thousands and be extremely disfiguring. At least a third of NF1 
patients develop larger benign plexiform neurofibromas that 
cause disfigurement and morbidity when they compress vital 
structures. Surgical removal of neurofibromas is not always fea-
sible due to tumor location, resulting in substantial morbidity 
for NF1 patients, and plexiform neurofibromas can transform to 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a leading 
cause of death in adults with NF1 (3–6). There is currently no 
chemotherapeutic regimen that will effectively treat NF1 tumors, 
warranting investigation into the development of novel molec-
ular-targeted therapeutic strategies (7). Studies have begun to 
identify molecular alterations in MPNST tumors, yet the path-
way of molecular events contributing to neurofibroma growth or 
progression to malignancy remains unclear (8).

Neurofibromin is a Ras-GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP), 
converting active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP (9, 10). Therefore, 
cells isolated from neurofibromas (11) and MPNSTs (12, 13) that 
lack neurofibromin have elevated levels of active Ras-GTP. Aber-
rant activation of Ras signaling generally leads to promotion of 
tumor cell proliferation and/or survival (14). However, in benign

tumors, Ras signaling can alternatively be associated with onco-
gene-induced senescence (15, 16), and evidence supports a role for 
cellular senescence in NF1 dermal neurofibromas (17).

At least 11 effector pathways downstream of Ras-GTP have 
been described (18). Research focused on the biology of NF1 
and pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST has 
identified potential therapeutic targets including Ras itself, Ras 
effectors, growth factor receptors, and angiogenesis (8, 19). For 
example, Ral and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1, where mTOR indi-
cates mammalian target of rapamycin, are known to regulate 
cell proliferation, survival, and cell death and have each been 
implicated in NF1 tumorigenesis (20, 21). S6K1 is activated in 
MPNST cells with NF1 mutations, and this response is attenu-
ated by rapamycin in MPNST cell lines, MPNST xenografts, and 
in a genetic engineered mouse model with Nf1 and p53 mutations 
in cis (22, 23). On this basis, a phase II trial of rapamycin in plexi-
form neurofibromas is ongoing. However, no chemotherapeu-
tic approach blocking any molecular target, including tyrosine 
kinases upstream of Ras, Ras, Ras effectors, or combination of 
effectors, has to date prevented or arrested neurofibroma forma-
tion or more than transiently delayed MPNST growth (7).

Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) Nf1 models have been 
developed using Cre/lox technology for ablation of Nf1 (24–28). 
We chose the Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre model for preclinical testing, as the 
neurofibroma histology in this model replicates human neurofi-
broma histology (25, 26). While some mouse models of neurofi-
broma formation, and perhaps some human patients, require a 
heterozygous genetic background (29), the Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre model 
does not, facilitating preclinical testing. We have used 7 Tesla 
small-animal MRI to assess tumor growth rate in the Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre

mouse model using volumetric MRI analysis. However, treatment 
with the rapamycin analog RAD001 failed to block tumor growth, 
and the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib affected few mice (30). 
The same volumetric measurement technique is in use in ongo-
ing clinical trials and has been proven to sensitively detect small 
changes in tumor size over time (31, 32). The reproducibility of 
this method is similar for tumors in mice and humans, and thus 
the response criteria used in human trials can be applied to the 
preclinical evaluation in mice. Here, we confirm the transcription-
al similarities of human and mouse tumors using a bioinformatics 
approach and illustrate the use of our GEM model for preclinical 
evaluation of candidate molecular targets.

We compared the transcriptomes of human NF1 tumors and 
GEM Nf1 models to normal differentiated peripheral nerves of 
each species to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to 
tumorigenesis and shared potential therapeutic targets. Our 
results  support  the  hypothesis  that  hyperactive  Ras  induces 
expression of genes that suppresses the canonical downstream 
pathway, Raf/MEK/ERK, in benign neurofibromas and MPNST. 
Although these transcriptional changes suggest that a negative 
feedback loop has been induced, ERK remains active in these 
tumors. Based on these data, we performed preclinical trials of 
the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 in mouse models of NF1-associ-
ated peripheral nerve tumors and observed remarkable efficacy. 
Similarly, elsewhere in this issue of the JCI, Chang and cowork-
ers report dramatic responses to PD0325901 in a mouse model 
of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) characterized by 
homozygous Nf1 inactivation (33). Together, these data provide 
a strong rationale for targeting MEK in the treatment of NF1-
associated neoplasms.

Results
PD0325901 inhibits MEK and moderately reduces MPNST cell survival in 
vitro. To identify molecular similarities between mouse and human 
NF1 tumors, we performed cross-species transcriptome analysis 
of human NF1-derived peripheral nerve tumors, neurofibroma 
and MPNST (n = 32) (34), and mouse neurofibroma and MPNST  
(n = 33) compared with normal differentiated peripheral nerves of 
each species (Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material avail-
able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI60578DS1). Human 
data were publically available from our previous studies (34); 
mouse data have been deposited in the GEO database (GSE41747). 
Hierarchical clustering of orthologous transcripts defined expres-
sion clusters (C17–C20; Supplemental Figure 1A). To prioritize 
relevant genes, we queried transcripts from orthologous clusters 
(C17–C20; Supplemental Figure 1) representing significant tran-
scriptional changes in mouse and human samples. Notably, both 
species upregulated expression of genes that negatively regulate 
the canonical Ras effector pathway Raf/MEK/ERK (Supplemental 
Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 1, B and C). Despite transcrip-
tional upregulation of genes that repress Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, 
and consistent with neurofibroma (11) and MPNST (12, 13) cells 
having elevated levels of Ras-GTP, activation of the downstream 
effector ERK was maintained in neurofibromas and MPNSTs, as 
elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) were detected in 
neurofibromas and MPNSTs (Supplemental Figure 2).

PD0325901 is a MEK inhibitor currently in clinical cancer tri-
als (35, 36). Of 70 tested kinases, PD0325901 blocked MEK1 at 
values of 1 μM in vitro, with the closely related MEK5 affected at 
10-fold higher concentrations (37); no other kinases were affect-
ed. The unusual specificity of this inhibitor is due to the fact that

tumor volume in an individual animal from day 0

model analysis indicated statistical significance for 
each dose (P < 0.001; see Supplemental Figure 4).

PD0325901 is not a direct kinase inhibitor, but rather an allosteric 
inhibitor. In comparison with its predecessor CI-1040, PD0325901 
is more potent and has improved duration and bioavailability and 
increased metabolic stability (38). PD0325901 blocked Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling based on pharmacodynamic measurement of p-ERK 
in MPNST xenografts at intervals after PD0325901 exposure  
(Figure 1, A–D). p-ERK disappeared by 30 minutes after dosing 
MPNST xenografts (Figure 1B); levels remained low at 6 hours (Fig-
ure 1C) and resembled pretreatment levels by 24 hours (Figure 1D).  
Pharmacodynamic assessment of PD0325901 was at the end of 
the 60-day treatment period, demonstrating that the inhibitor 
remained efficacious throughout the experiment. Dose-response 
analysis of PD0325901 was conducted on 5 MPNST cell lines 
in vitro. Four MPNST cell lines were derived from NF1 patients 
(S462TY, S462, ST8814, T265); 1 MPNST cell line was derived 
from a sporadic MPNST (STS26T). After 4 days of treatment, 
effects on survival in the 4 NF1-derived cell lines were modest and 
variable (IC50 values 420–3100 nM (203–1495 ng/ml); (Figure 1E). 
Some of these concentrations were below the achievable trough 
plasma level (250 ng/ml) in humans (35); all were below the maxi-
mal documented achievable peak plasma level (1508 ng/ml) (36). 
Interestingly, the sporadic MPNST cell line (STS26T), expressing 
low levels of Ras-GTP (39), was least sensitive to PD0325901. Rela-
tive to other tumor cell lines, especially BRAF mutant cells (average 
IC50 values < 10 nM) (40), MPNST cells were not particularly sensi-
tive to MEK inhibition in vitro.

To exclude PD0325901 off-target effects, we utilized a MEK 
mutant,  L115P,  predicted  to  block  interaction  of  MEK  and 
PD0325901 (33). Expressing this mutant protein in the NF1-defi-

cient tumor cell line MPNST 8814 blocked ERK activation and cell 
proliferation in PD0325901-treated cells. Importantly, expression 
of the mutant did not block the effects of PD098059, a structur-
ally unrelated MEK inhibitor (Supplemental Figure 3).

To  test  the  effect  of  MEK  inhibition  on  MPNST  in  vivo, 
S462TY MPNST cells derived from an NF1 patient were implant-
ed into nu/nu mice (41) and treated with PD0325901 at a dose  
(10 mg/kg/d) comparable to the dose previously tested in the 
clinic (35, 36, 42). Inhibiting MEK activity diminished tumor 
growth (Figure 1F) and doubled survival (mean survival = 22.5 vs. 
52.5 days; P < 0.0001) (Figure 1G). We did not observe complete 
suppression of tumor growth in vivo, supporting the moderate 
response to MEK inhibition in vitro.

Efficacy of PD0325901 on neurofibroma growth in vivo. In Nf1fl/fl; 
Dhh-Cre mice, the Nf1 gene is deleted exclusively in Schwann cells. 
All Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre mice develop multiple neurofibromas with his-
tological identity to human neurofibromas (25). Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre 
mice neurofibroma growth rates can be measured using serial 
volumetric MRI analysis (30). Neurofibroma growth rates vary 
among mice, mimicking human neurofibromas, which are also 
monitored by serial MRI. There is less than 10% variability in mea-
surement of the same tumor from 2 individuals, and tumor size 
measured by MRI has been verified by direct dissection (43). We 
measured tumor volume at 5 (Figure 2, A and D) and 7 (Figure 2, 
B and E) months. Eighteen tumor-bearing mice were randomly 
assigned to PD0325901 treatment (10 mg/kg/day) (Figure 2F); 
10 received vehicle (Figure 2C). All tumors in an individual mouse 
responded equally to treatment. Therefore, we compared the sum 
of tumor volumes in each individual mouse before and after treat-

inhibitor  has  been  reported  to 
cause  toxicity  in  human  trials 
after  prolonged  exposure  (35, 
36,  42),  we  also  analyzed  mice 
for  effects  at  lower  doses  of 
PD0325901.  Sixteen  mice  were 
treated  with  5  mg/kg  and  15 
mice with 1.5 mg/kg PD0325901. 
The 1.5 mg/kg PD0325901 dose 
in  mice  provided  a  concentra-
tion  similar  to  that  which  will 
be  tested  in  upcoming  human 
trials  (8  mg  BID).  A  striking 
reduction  in  neurof ibroma 
volumes  was  achieved  after  
60 days of PD0325901 treatment  
(Figure 2G). Remarkably, tumor 
volumes  were  reduced  in  mice 
treated  with  1.5  mg/kg  (10/15 
mice),  5  mg/kg  (15/16  mice), 
or  10  mg/kg  (14/18  mice) 
PD0325901 (P < 0.001 each dose; 
mixed models analysis; Supple-
mental  Figure  4).  PD0325901 
was well tolerated with no appar-
ent toxicity at any dose.

Reduced  tumor  volume  sug-
gested  that  cell  proliferation 
or  cell  death  might  be  altered 
in  neurofibromas.  Cell  prolif-
eration was decreased at the end 
point of PD0325901 treatment 
of Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre neurofibromas 
(Figure  3A).  Similar  effects  on 
cell proliferation were observed 
at all 3 doses (P < 0.001). Apop-
tosis was not observed at the end 
of the experiment (not shown), 
but neurofibromas did regress. 
MPNST xenografts treated with 
PD0325901  showed  a  mod-
est  and  marginally  significant  
(P < 0.05) reduction in proliferat-
ing Ki67+ cells (Figure 3B) relative 
to  neurofibromas  (Figure  3A).  
Similar effects on MPNST pro-
liferation  were  observed  with 
short-term (11 days) or long-term  
(28 days) exposure to PD0325901 
(Figure  3B).  Double  labeling 
tumor  sections  with  Ki67  and 
CNPase, a Schwann cell marker, 
indicated that many of the prolif-
erating cells were Schwann cells 
(Figure 3, C and D).

ed control mice from the same genotype and strain background

rectly from effects of tumor cells on endothelial cells or directly 
through effects on blood vessels. In either case, changes in tumor 
vasculature likely contributed to changes in tumor volume.

Interestingly, we observed reduced p-S6K in PD0325901-treated 
Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre neurofibromas, but not MPNSTs (Figure 3, G–J), 
suggesting that S6K is in part downstream of MEK in NF1 benign 
tumor cells. A reduction in p-S6K after MEK inhibition was also 
observed in melanoma cell lines (44). Ras/PI3K/Akt is a Ras path-
way alternative to Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, but PD0325901 did not 
affect p-AKT levels in neurofibromas or MPNSTs (Figure 3, K–N), 
validating PD0325901 specificity as a MEK inhibitor.

PD0325901 maintains MEK inhibition at low doses in Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre 
neurofibromas. To determine whether the Raf/MEK/ERK negative 
feedback mechanism suggested by the microarray data (Supple-
mental Figure 1, B and C) was valid, we analyzed p-ERK and 
expression of 2 candidate genes, SPRY4 and DUSP6, at the end 
of the 60-day treatment period of Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre with low-dose  
(1.5 mg/kg) and high-dose (10 mg/kg) PD0325901. As observed 
with high-dose treatment of MPNST xenografts (Figure 1, A–D), 
p-ERK was reduced in Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre neurofibromas relative to 
control (Figure 4A) by 30 minutes (Figure 4B), remained low at  
6 hours (Figure 4C), and was robust at 24 hours after the last dose 
of drug (Figure 4D). Reduced p-ERK was observed whether neuro-
fibromas shrank or did not shrink after exposure to PD0325901 

(not shown). Similar results were observed with the low-dose treat-
ment at 30 minutes and 6 hours (Figure 4, E–G). However, in sec-
tions from mice treated with 1.5 mg/kg MEK inhibitor, p-ERK 
remained suppressed at 24 hours (Figure 4H).

We confirmed overexpression of SPRY4 and DUSP6 in Nf1 fl/fl; 
Dhh-Cre neurofibromas relative to WT mouse nerve (Figure 4I). 
Expression of SPRY4 and DUSP6 mRNA was each reduced relative 
to vehicle control–treated mice at 6 hours following the last dose 
of PD0325901 at 10 mg/kg (Figure 4J) or 1.5 mg/kg (Figure 4K)  
PD0325901. However, a significant increase in expression at  
24 hours was only observed with the higher dose (Figure 4, J and 
K). These data suggest that different levels of MEK inhibition 
differentially affect accumulation of mRNAs encoding negative 
feedback regulators of ERK. Importantly, the data are consistent 
with the response of neurofibromas to single-agent MEK inhibi-
tion, even at low doses.

Discussion
A primary goal of this study was to identify and evaluate gene 
expression signatures shared between human NF1 tumors and 
GEM Nf1 models. We posited that shared signatures would reveal 
critical mechanisms of tumorigenesis and key therapeutic targets 
to facilitate preclinical studies and development of NF1 thera-
peutics. Functional enrichment analysis identified a prominent

research articletheme, Raf/MEK/ERK suppression, shared between mouse and 
human. Despite this transcriptional signature, ERK signaling 
remained activated in NF1 tumors and inhibiting Raf/MEK/ERK 
signaling with a MEK inhibitor diminished tumor cell growth. 
Our data set provides a wealth of gene expression information and 
supports MEK signaling as an important clinical target in NF1.

Our results identify a transcriptional response to suppress Raf/
MEK/ERK  activity  in  neurofibromas  and  MPNST,  including 
overexpression of DUSP and Sprouty family members, feedback 
inhibitors of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Expression of DUSP fam-
ily members was reported in response to NF1 ablation in human 
fibroblasts (17) and KRAS2-activating mutations in lung tumors 
(45), suggesting a common mechanism of suppression in Ras-
driven tumors. Elevated SPRY4 expression was also reported in 
response to NF1 deficiency in fibroblasts, and exogenous expres-
sion of SPRY2 induced senescence in NF1-deficient fibroblasts (17). 
DUSP and Sprouty genes are members of a 52-gene transcriptional 
profile that is specifically downstream of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling; 
these genes are expressed at high levels in tumor cell lines with an 
activating Raf mutation (V600EBRAF) but not tumor cell lines with 
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation (46). Consistent with our 
results in Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre neurofibromas, PD0325901 MEK inhibi-
tion reduces expression of these genes and blocks cell proliferation 
in tumor cell lines with an activating Raf mutation (40).

The PD0325901-induced reduction of neurofibroma volume in 
39/49 (80%) of neurofibroma-bearing Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre mice repre-
sents the most dramatic result described to date for treatment of 
neurofibroma-bearing mice. In contrast, RAD001 did not decrease 
neurofibroma volume, and sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, 
decreased tumor volume in only 5 of 9 (56%) mice (30). Imatinib, 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, showed an un-quantified effect on 
tumor burden in another neurofibroma mouse model (29). Plexi-
form neurofibromas have a slow growth rate and a complex non-
spherical shape. Therefore, standard response criteria for malig-
nant solid tumors have limited applicability. A more sensitive 
and reproducible method of response evaluation for human NF1 
plexiform neurofibromas was developed, evaluating response and 
progression using volumetric MRI analysis. Response is defined as 
20% or greater decrease in tumor volume compared with baseline, 
and progression is defined as 20% or greater increase in tumor vol-
ume compared with baseline (32). Plexiform neurofibroma shrink-
age has not been observed in clinical trials, with the exception of 
up to 22% in response to pegintron (47) and rarely in response to 
imatinib (48). The method of volumetric MRI analysis used in our 
preclinical studies is identical to the method used in clinical trials, 
and we used identical response criteria.

Similar to our results, a previous study reported variable effects 
on MPNST cell survival in vitro with the MEK inhibitor from 
which PD0325901 was derived, PD184352 (CI-1040) (49). In con-
trast, the PD0325901 MEK inhibitor showed a robust, yet tran-
sient, in vivo effect on survival, possibly due to effects on tumor 
vasculature. We did not observe persistent apoptosis following 
PD0325901 treatment in vivo, in contrast with effects in vitro 
(49). Due to the multiplicity of Ras effectors and complexity of 
negative feedback regulation, therapeutic strategies against more 
aggressive Ras-related tumors are likely to include combinations 
of compounds that target multiple points in the Ras signaling 
network (40, 50–52). These studies support the investigation of 
combinatorial effects of PD0325901 with additional Ras pathway 
inhibitors in NF1 tumors.

Our results provide preclinical evidence implicating PD0325901 
as a candidate NF1 therapeutic agent. This was unexpected, as the 
MEK inhibitor from which PD0325901 was derived failed to show 
efficacy in a GEM model of Nf1 JMML (53). Recently, PD0325901 
was found to be effective in reversing myeloproliferative dis-
ease in an activated KRas mouse model (54) and in Nf1-driven 
JMML (33), likely due to the more persistent inhibition of MEK 
by PD0325901, a second-generation MEK inhibitor modified to 
improve efficacy for clinical cancer trials (55). Collectively, these 
studies suggest that Raf/MEK/ERK is a critical pathway in NF1.

Preliminary studies reported adverse effects after prolonged treat-
ment of patients with advanced cancers with 10 mg or more BID 
PD0325901 (35, 36, 42). MPNST xenografts were only moderately 
sensitive to PD0325901 treatment at this dose, likely requiring 
combination therapies for MPNST treatment. However, the results 
of our experiments suggest that the lowest dose of 1.5 mg/kg in our 
preclinical neurofibroma mouse model, equivalent to 8 mg BID in 
humans, is as effective in inhibiting tumor growth as the higher dose 
of 10 mg/kg, supporting evaluation of new dosing schedules in clin-
ical trials of PD0325901. Furthermore, the lower dose (1.5 mg/kg)  
appeared more effective in maintaining inhibition of MEK, with 
the higher dose activating the negative feedback response and 
elevating p-ERK to pretreatment levels. Fine-tuning the long-term 
maximal effective dose below the threshold of negative feedback 
may be relevant to monitoring PD0325901 in the clinic.

In summary, NF1 mutation causing neurofibromatosis results in 
hyperactive Ras, potentially activating numerous downstream signal-
ing pathways. However, a successful targeted therapy in humans has 
not yet been developed. Combining mouse and human transcrip-
tome data focused attention on increased expression of genes that 
suppress the Raf/MEK/ERK arm of Ras signaling. This transcrip-
tional repression does not apparently compensate, as ERK phosphor-
ylation was detected in neurofibromas and MPNST. Furthermore, 
inhibition of neurofibroma and MPNST growth with PD0325901 
indicated dependence of both tumor types on sustained Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling. The results of our preclinical tests of PD0325901 in 
MPNST and neurofibroma support investigation of MEK inhibitors 
as candidate therapeutics in the treatment of Ras-related diseases, 
including NF1 and other “RASopathies” (56). In addition, NF1 muta-
tions are frequently found in tumor types other than neurofibroma 
and MPNST, including glioblastoma (57), lung adenocarcinoma 
(58), and ovarian cancer (59). Thus, PD0325901 may be a potential 
molecular-targeted treatment for a wide variety of disorders.

Methods
Gene expression microarray. Mouse RNA isolation, hybridization and data nor-
malization, mouse-human ortholog mapping and cross-species data integra-
tion are described in Supplemental Methods. Mouse microarray data can be 
accessed in the GEO MIAME-compliant public database (GSE41747).

In vitro MPNST cytotoxicity assay. MPNST cell lines (STS26T, ST8814, 
S462, S462TY, T265p21) were obtained and maintained as described 
(41). All MPNST cell lines were derived from NF1 patients except STS26T. 
MPNST cells were plated in quadruplicate for each dose of PD0325901 
MEK inhibitor (gift of Pfizer Inc.). 24 hours after plating, cells were treated 
with vehicle alone (0.1% DMSO) or inhibitor. Cell viability was quantified 
96 hours after treatment by MTS assay as described (22).

Transient transfection of MPNST cells. Nucleofection and Western analyses 

are described in Supplemental Methods.

MPNST xenograft. The subcutaneous NF1–/– S462-TY human MPNST 
xenograft model has been previously described (41, 60). Administration

research articleand dose of PD0325901 were determined by previous animal studies (61). 
Daily oral gavage of vehicle (0.5% [w/v] methylcellulose solution with 0.2% 
[v/v] polysorbate 80 [Tween 80] or 10 mg/kg PD0325901 in vehicle) was 
given for 28 days beginning when tumors reached 200 mm3 3–4 weeks 
after injection. We measured tumors and weighed mice twice weekly once 
tumors began enlarging. Tumor volume was calculated as follows: L × W2 
(π/6), where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. Mice were treated 
until tumors reached 2500 mm3 or a maximum of 92 days. 100% of control 
tumors reached 2500 mm3. Two of 18 PD0325901-treated mice did not 
reach 2500 mm3; one showed complete and sustained remission at 150 days.  
Survival was analyzed by log-rank test using GraphPad Prism.

Neurofibroma MRI and tumor volume measurement. MRI and tumor vol-
ume measurement of Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre mice was conducted as described (30). 
Mice were administered vehicle control (0.5% [w/v] methylcellulose solu-
tion with 0.2% [v/v] polysorbate 80 [Tween 80] or PD0325901 [1.5, 5.0, 
or 10 mg/kg/d]) by oral gavage for 60 days. Due to the high cost of per-
forming serial MRI, littermate controls (n = 5) were allocated to the vehicle 
treatment group. In addition, historical controls (n = 20) were untreated 
or vehicle-treated control mice from the same genotype and strain back-
ground imaged over the 18 months preceding these experiments; these 
were included to increase statistical power (mixed effects model analysis).
MPNST statistical analysis. For MPNST, computing the mean and SEM 
based solely on surviving mice created downward bias, as mice with large 
tumors required sacrifice. We analyzed the longitudinally collected tumor 
volumes together across time points and conducted mixed effects analysis 
with autoregressive within-mouse dependent structure. Missing data from 
sacrificed mice with large tumors constituted a missing-at-completely-ran-
dom (MACR) condition, under which the mixed effects analysis provided 
consistent estimates of mean tumor volume and SEM (62).

Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, hydrated 
and transferred to 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Slides 
were boiled for 10 minutes in citrate buffer, cooled at room temperature 
for 30 minutes, then rinsed in water twice and in PBS 3 times. Sections 
were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, rinsed in PBS, 
and blocked in 10% normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections 
were incubated overnight in primary antibody diluted in block; rabbit 
pERK (#4370, 1:200, Cell Signaling; see Supplemental Methods), rabbit 
Ki67 (1:10,000; Novocastra), rat MECA 32 (1:5; Developmental Studies 
Hybridoma Bank), rabbit pS6Kinase (1:800; Cell Signaling), rabbit pAKT 
(1:50), and mouse CNPase (1:750; MAB226, Millipore). Sections were then 
incubated in appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies; goat anti-rab-
bit or goat anti-rat (1:200; Vector). Some sections were counterstained with 
Harris hematoxylin. Numbers of MECA+ blood vessels were counted in 10 
×20 fields per MPNST (n = 5) and 5 ×20 fields per neurofibroma (n = 5)  
for each condition. Statistical comparisons between control and tumor 
samples were conducted using Student’s t test. All microscopic images were 
acquired with Openlab software suites on a Zeiss Axiovert 200.

For double labeling, paraffin sections were processed for antigen retriev-
al as above and incubated overnight in a cocktail of 2 of the following 
primary antibodies: rabbit p-ERK (1:200; 4370, Cell Signaling), mouse 
CNPase (1:750; MAB226, Millipore), rabbit Ki67 (1:1000; Novocastra), and 
rat MECA 32 (1:5; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Sections were 
then incubated with a cocktail of 2 appropriate secondary antibodies: Goat 
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:800; Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse Alexa 
Fluor 594 (1:1200; Invitrogen), and goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1200; 
Invitrogen). Sections were stained with DAPI (1:10,000) to visualize cell 
nuclei and mounted with Fluoromount G. Pictures were taken under a 
fluorescent microscope, and cells were counted using ImageJ software.

qRT-PCR. mRNAs were extracted from WT sciatic nerves, Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre 
mouse neurofibromas, and PD0325901- or vehicle-treated Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre 

mouse neurofibromas using the Mini-mRNA isolation kit (QIAGEN). 
The mRNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript Preamplifica-
tion System (Gibco; Invitrogen). Superscript II reverse transcriptase was 
used in the reaction, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Duplicate samples 
lacking reverse transcriptase were conducted to control for genomic DNA 
contamination. Primers were designed and synthesized by Integrated DNA 
Technologies (IDT) for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of SPRY4 and 
DUSP6 (SPRY4F: 5′-TGTGAATCCCAGCTCAGTCATGGT-3′; SPRY4R: 
5′-ATTCTCCACGTGGCTGGTCTTCAT-3′; DUSP6F: 5′-TGCCCAATCT-
GTTTGAGAATGCGG-3′;  DUSP6R:  5′-CAATGCACCAGGACACCA-
CAGTTT-3′). Mouse tubulin primers (IDT) were included in each reaction 
as a positive control for cDNA. Triplicate reactions were performed in an ABI 
Prism 7500 as described (63). For statistical analyses, 3 mice were included 
for each treatment group. Relative gene expression was calibrated to tubu-
lin expression. Fold change of SPRY4 or DUSP6 in untreated Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre 
mouse neurofibromas compared with WT levels or in PD0325901-treated 
Nf1fl/fl;Dhh-Cre mouse neurofibromas compared with vehicle-treated Nf1fl/fl; 
Dhh-Cre mouse neurofibromas was calculated using the ΔΔCT method.

Statistics. For gene expression microarray data analyses, ANOVA tests 
were used to identify transcripts differentially expressed; all tests were cor-
rected for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg 
false discovery rate correction. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05 for 
all biological experiments. MPNST survival analyses used Kaplan Meier 
analysis followed by a Gehan-Breslow-Wilcox log-rank test. Neurofibro-
ma growth was modeled by Mixed Effects Model Analysis; we generated  
P values with a random effects model analysis on log transformed tumor 
volume data using the SAS mixed procedure. Proliferation, cell death, and 
blood vessel quantification used 2-tailed Student’s t test.

Study approval. Human paraffin-embedded tissues were collected under 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) IRB approval. 
Informed consent was not required, as we used archival samples from a 
tissue bank that remained anonymous. The CCHMC Animal Use and Care 
Committee approved all animal use.
