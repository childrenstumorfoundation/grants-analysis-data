SUMMARY

It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by activating upstream components of
the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1 in the nucleus.
We found that derepressed CRL4DCAF1 promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by ubiquitylating
and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-
derived missense mutations indicate that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deﬁ-
cient tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples conﬁrms that this pathway operates in NF2-mutant tumors. We
conclude that derepressed CRL4DCAF1 promotes activation of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.

INTRODUCTION

The tumor suppressor Merlin/NF2 was identiﬁed in 1993 in
patients affected by neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) and was
later found to be mutated in sporadic meningiomas, ependy-
momas, and schwannomas; a large fraction of malignant
pleural mesotheliomas; and a small percentage of other tumor
types. Merlin is a multifunctional protein that shuttles between
the cell cortex and the nucleus in a manner reminiscent of
the cell adhesion and signaling component b-catenin. However,
it remains unclear whether Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by
activating antimitogenic signals at the cell cortex or in the
nucleus and by what molecular mechanism (Li et al., 2012
and references therein).

Studies in Drosophila suggest that Merlin combines with
Expanded and Kibra at the cell cortex to activate the Hippo
tumor suppressor pathway (Halder and Johnson, 2011). This
pathway consists of a kinase cascade comprising the kinase
Hippo (MST1/2 in mammals), the adaptor Salvador (Sav1), and
the kinase Warts (Lats1/2). The ﬁnal element, Warts/Lats, phos-
phorylates and inactivates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie/
YAP, suppressing Scalloped/TEAD-dependent transcription of
genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (Hariharan and
Bilder, 2006; Harvey and Tapon, 2007; Pan, 2010; Zhao et al.,
2010a). In Drosophila, the Hippo pathway restrains cell prolifera-
tion and promotes apoptosis to limit organ size and to suppress
the development of
tumorous overgrowths (Hariharan and
Bilder, 2006; Harvey and Tapon, 2007; Pan, 2010; Zhao et al.,

Signiﬁcance

In spite of signiﬁcant advances, the mechanism by which Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis has remained incompletely
understood. We have found that Merlin translocates into the nucleus, where it inhibits the promitogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase
CRL4DCAF1. Here we provide evidence that CRL4DCAF1 promotes YAP-dependent transcription and oncogenesis by ubiqui-
tylating and, thereby, inhibiting the Hippo pathway components Lats1 and 2. Analysis of clinical samples indicates that this
signaling mechanism operates in NF2-mutant tumors. These results reveal the mechanism by which Merlin activates the
Hippo pathway and suppresses tumorigenesis.

Cancer Cell
CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Oncogenesis by Inhibiting Lats

2010a). Genetic studies in mouse models and genomic analyses
of human tumors indicate that Lats1/2 can function as a tumor
suppressor and YAP as an oncogene, providing evidence that
the function of the downstream segment of the Hippo pathway
is evolutionarily conserved (Overholtzer et al., 2006; St John
et al., 1999; Zender et al., 2006). Because mammalian Merlin
can inhibit YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription and deletion
of Yap suppresses liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis in mice
carrying a conditional ablation of Nf2, it has been proposed
that Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by activating the Hippo
pathway (Zhang et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2007). However,
because YAP is necessary for the expansion of bipotential liver
progenitors during development, this result does not necessarily
imply that YAP signaling drives hepatocellular carcinoma devel-
opment. In fact, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cos-
mic data sets indicates that no Hippo pathway component is
altered at a signiﬁcant frequency in human liver cancer (Cerami
et al., 2012). In addition, the upstream regulators of the Hippo
pathway, and the way in which they are interconnected, have
diverged after the separation of arthropods and chordates (Bos-
suyt et al., 2014), suggesting that Merlin inhibits Hippo signaling
through divergent mechanisms in Drosophila and mammals.

We have found that the dephosphorylated, active conformer
of mammalian Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting
the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1 in the nucleus (Li et al.,
2010). Intriguingly, CRL4DCAF1 controls an oncogenic program
of gene expression that includes TEAD target genes, suggesting
that Merlin controls Hippo signaling by inhibiting CRL4DCAF1 (Li
et al., 2010). Here we provide evidence that derepressed
CRL4DCAF1 targets Lats1 and 2 for ubiquitylation and inhibition
in the nucleus and, thus, activates YAP-driven transcription
and oncogenesis.

RESULTS

Deregulated CRL4DCAF1 Induces Activation of YAP
To examine whether CRL4DCAF1 inactivates the Hippo signaling
pathway, we examined NF2-mutant mesothelioma and schwan-
noma cells. Meso-33 mesothelioma cells undergo a complete
proliferation arrest in response to re-expression of Merlin (Li
et al., 2010) and do not possess genetic abnormalities at the
BAP1 locus, which is frequently mutated in malignant mesothe-
liomas devoid of NF2 mutations (Bott et al., 2011). As antici-
pated, re-expression of Merlin induced robust phosphorylation
of YAP at its major negative regulatory site, S127, which is phos-
phorylated by Lats1 and 2 in these cells (Figure 1A, lanes 1 and
2). Notably, expression of DCAF1 reduced phosphorylation of
YAP at the same site, suggesting that CRL4DCAF1 can promote
YAP signaling (Figure S1A available online).

We have shown previously that wild-type DCAF1 partially re-
verses the inhibition of proliferation induced by Merlin, whereas
a mutant
lacking the C-terminal Merlin-binding segment
(DCAF1 1417X) completely reverses this process (Li et al.,
2010). Intriguingly, although wild-type DCAF1 alleviated the abil-
ity of Merlin to induce phosphorylation of YAP, DCAF1 1417X
suppressed it almost completely, suggesting that Merlin inacti-
vates YAP by inhibiting CRL4DCAF1 (Figure 1A). In agreement
with this hypothesis, depletion of DCAF1 induced phosphoryla-
tion of YAP and suppressed expression of the YAP target genes

CTGF (Figure 1B; Figure S1B), BIRC5, and CYR61 (Figure S1B).
Moreover, it induced translocation of YAP/TAZ from the nucleus
(Figures S1C and S1D) and suppressed transcription from a
TEAD-dependent reporter (Figure S1E). These results indicate
that CRL4DCAF1 is necessary for activation of YAP in NF2-mutant
mesothelioma cells.

To extend these ﬁndings, we examined FC-1801 mouse
schwannoma cells that were derived from Nf2Flox/Flox mice (Lal-
lemand et al., 2009). In response to re-expression of Merlin,
these cells undergo proliferation arrest and are no longer tumor-
igenic (Li et al., 2010). Expression of Merlin also induced phos-
phorylation of YAP in these cells (Figure S1F). Strikingly,
although YAP/TAZ accumulated almost exclusively in the nuclei
of these cells, even when they were conﬂuent, silencing of
DCAF1 provoked almost complete YAP/TAZ extrusion to the
cytoplasm in most cells (Figure 1C; data not shown). Moreover,
silencing of DCAF1 inhibited transcription from a TEAD-depen-
dent reporter, although not as completely as overexpression of
Merlin or dominant-negative TEAD (Figure 1D). Finally,
in
agreement with prior DNA microarray analyses (Li et al., 2010),
overexpression of DCAF1 increased, and silencing of DCAF1
decreased, the expression of YAP target genes in FC-1801
cells (Figure S1G). Thus, derepression of CRL4DCAF1 activates
YAP and induces TEAD-dependent transcription in NF2-mutant
tumor cells.

CRL4DCAF1 Activates YAP without Inhibiting MST or
Salvador
Unexpectedly, neither expression of Merlin nor silencing of
DCAF1 increased phosphorylation of the activation loop of
MST1 or MST2 (Figures S1H and S1I)
(Deng et al., 2003;
Glantschnig et al., 2002). In addition, neither of these manipula-
tions promoted phosphorylation of Lats1 at the MST1/2 phos-
phorylation site T1079. Rather, these manipulations decreased
this phosphorylation (Figures S1H and S1I), presumably by acti-
vating the negative feedback loops that restrain ﬂux through the
Hippo pathway (Genevet et al., 2010; Hamaratoglu et al., 2006;
Xiao et al., 2011). These results suggest that the deregulation
of YAP induced by loss of Merlin and activation of CRL4DCAF1
is not due to decreased activation of Lats1 by MST1/2.

To corroborate this hypothesis, we examined whether simulta-
neous depletion of MST1 and MST2 decreased phosphorylation
of YAP in Merlin re-expressing or DCAF1-silenced Meso-33
cells. Notably, phosphorylation of YAP proceeded unabated
upon both manipulations (Figures 1E and 1F). Moreover, this
process was not affected by inactivation of the mammalian
ortholog of Salvador, Sav1, an essential component of the core
Hippo cassette (Lee et al., 2008; Tapon et al., 2002) (Figures
1G and 1H). Additional experiments revealed that silencing of
Sav1 enhances TEAD-dependent transcription in Meso-33 cells,
suggesting that the canonical Hippo pathway operates in these
cells. However, expression of Merlin counteracted this process
to a similar extent in control and Sav1-silenced cells (Figure S1J).
As anticipated, silencing of DCAF1 and re-expression of Merlin
failed to induce phosphorylation of YAP at S127 in cells depleted
of Lats1 and 2 (Figures S1K and S1L). These ﬁndings indicate
that the loss of Merlin and ensuing derepression of CRL4DCAF1
activate YAP independently of decreased ﬂux through the core
Hippo kinase cassette.

Lats1 and Lats2 Are Potential Substrates of CRL4DCAF1
Motivated by the above ﬁndings, we examined the hypothesis
that CRL4DCAF1 inhibits Lats1 and 2 by promoting their
ubiquitylation. FLAG-hemagglutinin (HA)-DCAF1 associated
efﬁciently with endogenous Lats1 and 2 but not with MST1 or
2 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T cells) (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B; Figure S2A). Mutagenesis indicated that the
C-terminal segment of DCAF1 interacts directly with the kinase
domain of Lats1 (Figures S2B and S2C). Because we could not
produce recombinant Lats2 in bacteria, we were unable to
verify that the C-terminal segment of DCAF1 also interacts
directly with the kinase domain of Lats2. However, the homol-
ogy between the kinase domains of Lats1 and 2 suggests that
this is the case. Because the C-terminal fragment of DCAF1
contains the WD40 domain, which is involved in substrate
recruitment (Angers et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2006), we hypothe-

sized that CRL4DCAF1 recruits Lats1 and 2 to direct
ubiquitylation.

their

To examine whether Lats1 and 2 are ubiquitylated in vivo,
HEK293T cells were transfected with His-ubiquitin and HA-
tagged Lats1 or Lats2, treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132, lysed in a guanidinium chloride-containing buffer, and
subjected to pulldown with nickel beads. Anti-HA immunoblot-
ting revealed that Lats1 is polyubiquitylated under
these
conditions (Figure 2C). Lower amounts of ubiquitylated Lats1
were recovered in the absence of MG132 (W.L and F.G.G.,
unpublished data),
in consonance with the hypothesis that
polyubiquitylation targets Lats1 for degradation through the pro-
teasome. In contrast, Lats2 appeared to be oligoubiquitylated
under the same experimental conditions (Figure 2D). Mass
spectrometry indicated that Lats1 is modiﬁed by the addition
of a single ubiquitin chain at K830 (Figure 2E; Table S1). K/R

substitution of residue 830 did not reduce polyubiquitylation of
Lats1 (Figure S2D), pointing to compensatory ubiquitylation of
additional lysine residues (King et al., 1996). In contrast, Lats2
was ubiquitylated at four sites (K383, K527, K633, and K968)
(Figure 2E; Table S1). Simultaneous K/R substitutions at these
residues did not reduce oligoubiquitylation of Lats2, again point-
ing to compensatory ubiquitylation of additional lysine residues
(Figure S2E).

CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Proteasomal Degradation of Lats1
To examine whether CRL4DCAF1 promotes polyubiquitylation of
Lats1, we performed in vivo ubiquitylation experiments. Expres-
sion of DCAF1 led to a large increase in polyubiquitylation of
Lats1 in Meso-33 cells, and simultaneous expression of Merlin
reversed this effect (Figure 3A). Moreover, although treatment
with MG132 increased the level of polyubiquitylation of Lats1
in control HEK293T cells, it failed to produce this effect in
DCAF1-depleted cells, indicating that CRL4DCAF1 is required
for efﬁcient polyubiquitylation of Lats1 (Figure S3A). To directly
test whether CRL4DCAF1 mediates ubiquitylation of Lats1, we
assembled recombinant CRL4DCAF1 in vitro and tested its ability

p-YAP) revealed that deubiquitylated Lats2 possesses a greatly
increased ability to phosphorylate GST-YAP at S127 compared
with total Lats2 (Figure S3H, top). Immunoblotting conﬁrmed
that treatment with USP8 drastically diminishes the total levels
of ubiquitylation of endogenous proteins (Figure S3H, bottom).
Taken together,
these ﬁndings indicate that ubiquitylation
profoundly inhibits the kinase activity of Lats2.

Merlin Inhibits the Interaction between CRL4DCAF1 and
Lats1
Prior studies have indicated that Merlin inhibits CRL4DCAF1 by
binding through its 4.1 protein, Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin
(FERM) domain to the C-terminal segment of DCAF1. Intrigu-
ingly, patient-derived mutants of Merlin lacking the coiled-coil
and C-terminal segments bind to DCAF1 but fail to suppress
CRL4DCAF1, suggesting that these latter segments are also
required for the inhibition of ligase activity (Li et al., 2010). To
test whether Merlin inhibits CRL4DCAF1 by interfering with sub-
strate recruitment, we examined whether expression of Merlin
interferes with the association of FLAG-HA-DCAF1 with endog-
enous Lats1 in HEK293T cells. Notably, cotransfection of
increasing concentrations of HA-Merlin led to a dose-dependent
reduction of the association of FLAG-HA-DCAF1 with Lats1 (Fig-
ure 3E). These results suggest that the coiled-coil and C-terminal
segments of Merlin may occlude the binding site for Lats on the
WD40 domain of DCAF1 (Figure 3F).

Nuclear Merlin Promotes Phosphorylation of YAP
Because CRL4DCAF1 accumulates predominantly in the nucleus
(Li et al., 2010), we examined whether Merlin needs to enter this
compartment to inactivate YAP and induce proliferation arrest.
First we generated a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal
ERT2 domain joined by a short linker to full-length Merlin or, as
a control, to dsRed (Figure S4A). The ERT2 domain drives
passenger proteins to the nucleus in response to tamoxifen
binding (Feil et al., 1997). As anticipated, treatment with tamox-
ifen induced accumulation of ERT2-Merlin and ERT2-DsRed in
the nucleus (Figure S4B). Intriguingly, nuclear accumulation of
Merlin, but not DsRed, induced phosphorylation of YAP and
inhibited the proliferation of Meso-33 cells (Figures S4C and
S4D). These results indicate that nuclear accumulation of
Merlin is sufﬁcient to induce phosphorylation of YAP and to
inhibit proliferation.

To examine whether nuclear

translocation of Merlin is
required to induce proliferation arrest, we used mutational anal-
ysis. Analysis of a series of deletion mutants revealed a poten-
tial nuclear localization motif at position 24–27 (VRIV). Although
alanine permutation of each residue or combinations of two or
three residues within this motif partially inhibited nuclear accu-
mulation of Merlin, a simultaneous alanine substitution of all
four
residues (24–27A) blocked this process completely
(Figures 4A and 4B). A mutant form of Merlin lacking the
VRIV sequence (D24–27) did not accumulate in the nucleus,
even when Crm1-dependent nuclear export was blocked with
leptomycin B, conﬁrming that this motif acts as a noncanonical
nuclear localization sequence (Figure 4C). Functional analysis
re-expression of Merlin D24–27 or Merlin
revealed that
24–27A does not induce phosphorylation of YAP or inhibit
cell proliferation and soft agar growth in Meso-33 cells

to ubiquitylate puriﬁed Lats1. We found that reconstituted CRL4
E3 ligase ubiquitylates Lats1 in vitro (Figure 3B). However,
because we did not detect a robust extension of ubiquitin chains
under the conditions of the assay, we infer that additional factors
may be required for chain elongation in vivo.

It is well established that polyubiquitylation serves as a signal
to target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation.
Because we had noticed that re-expression of Merlin and
silencing of DCAF1 increase the steady-state levels of Lats1 in
NF2-mutant cells (Figures S1H and S1I), we examined whether
expression of DCAF1 causes the opposite effect. Stable expres-
sion of moderate levels of DCAF1 decreased the steady state
levels of Lats1 in FC-1801 cells (Figure S3B). Furthermore, cyclo-
heximide chase experiments demonstrated that silencing of
DCAF1 prolongs the half-life of Lats1 in Meso-33 cells by more
than 2-fold, indicating that CRL4DCAF1 promotes degradation
of Lats1 (Figures 3C and 3D).

Because K830 lies within the kinase domain, polyubiquityla-
tion of Lats1 may inhibit kinase activity by interfering with binding
of ATP or recruitment of substrates. In addition, Lats1 and 2
contain an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain (UBA), which
could bind in cis or in trans to one or more C-terminal ubiquity-
lated sequences, inducing conformational changes that interfere
with kinase activity (Figure 2E). To examine whether polyubiqui-
tylation inhibits the activity of Lats1, we expressed HA-Lats1
and His-ubiquitin in HEK293T cells and isolated total and His-
ubiquitylated Lats1 by sequential afﬁnity binding and elution
(Figure S3C, top). An in vitro kinase assay indicated that ubiqui-
tylated Lats1 possesses a severely diminished ability to phos-
phorylate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-YAP at S127 as
compared to total Lats1 (Figure S3C, bottom). These results
suggest that polyubiquitylation inhibits Lats1 by blocking its
kinase activity and promoting its degradation.

CRL4DCAF1 Inhibits the Kinase Activity of Lats2
To investigate whether CRL4DCAF1 promotes ubiquitylation of
Lats2, we performed in vivo ubiquitylation experiments. Ectopic
expression of DCAF1 increased oligoubiquitylation of Lats2 to a
large extent, and simultaneous expression of Merlin reversed
this process (Figure S3D). Conversely, depletion of DCAF1 sup-
pressed oligoubiquitylation of Lats2 (Figure S3E). In addition, we
tested the ability of in vitro-assembled CRL4DCAF1 to promote
ubiquitylation of recombinant Lats2. The results indicated that
CRL4DCAF1 can ubiquitylate Lats2 in vitro (Figure S3F). Collec-
tively, these results suggest that CRL4DCAF1 mediates oligoubi-
quitylation of Lats2.

In agreement with the model that mono- and oligoubiquityla-
tion modify protein function without affecting protein stability
(Chen and Sun, 2009), silencing of DCAF1 did not increase the
steady-state levels of Lats2 (Figure S3G). Interestingly, Lats2 is
ubiquitylated at K968 within the kinase domain, at K633 near
the binding site for the coactivator Mob1/Mats, and at K527
near the PPXY motif involved in binding to YAP, suggesting
that oligoubiquitylated Lats2 may exhibit a reduced ability to
phosphorylate YAP/TAZ in vivo. To examine this hypothesis,
we performed in-lysate kinase assays. Lysates from cells
overexpressing HA-Lats2 were treated with the broad-speciﬁcity
deubiquitylase USP8 or vehicle control and incubated with
GST-YAP. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphorylated YAP (anti-

Figure 4. Nuclear Merlin Promotes YAP Phosphorylation and In-
hibits Proliferation
(A) Summary of biochemical subcellular fractionation experiments. Cyto-
plasmic/membrane and soluble nuclear fractions from Meso-33 cells ex-
pressing Merlin or indicated mutants were immunoblotted for Merlin.
(B) Subcellular fractions from Meso-33 cells expressing wild-type Merlin or the
indicated mutants were immunoblotted as indicated. CM, cytoplasmic/
membrane fraction; N, nuclear fraction; Int. b1, integrin b1.
(C) Meso-33 cells expressing wild-type Merlin (Mer) or Merlin D24–27 were
treated or not treated with leptomycin B to block nuclear export. Fixed cells
were immunostained as indicated. Scale bar, 20 mm.
(D and E) Meso-33 cells expressing Merlin or its mutants were subjected to
immunoblotting as indicated (D) or to a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay (E).
N.S., not signiﬁcant.
(F) FC-1801 cells transduced with wild-type Merlin or its mutants were sub-
jected to a soft agar assay. Error bars show ± SEM.
See also Figure S4.

(Figures 4D–4F; Fig. S4E). These deﬁciencies do not arise from
defective folding because these mutations are within the short
and ﬂexible N-terminal extension that distinguishes Merlin from
Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin proteins. Furthermore, both Merlin
D24–27 and Merlin 24–27A associated efﬁciently with Angio-
motin (Figure S4F), a recently identiﬁed Merlin-binding protein
primarily localized at tight junctions (Yi et al., 2011). In fact,
possibly resulting from their increased accumulation in the
cytoplasm, these Merlin mutants combined with Angiomotin
to a larger extent compared with wild-type Merlin (Figure S4F).
These results indicate that Merlin needs to translocate into the
nucleus to inactivate YAP and to suppress cell proliferation,
suggesting that the two events are linked.

CRL4DCAF1 Inhibits Lats in the Nucleus
Based on immunoﬂuorescence experiments on cells overex-
pressing tagged constructs or subcellular fractionation experi-
ments excluding the nuclear fraction, it has been proposed
that Lats1 and 2 execute their function at the cell cortex or in
the cytosol (Toji et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2013).
Because derepressed CRL4DCAF1 exerts its pro-oncogenic
function in the nucleus (Li et al., 2010), we considered the possi-
bility that its substrates Lats1 and 2 localize in this compartment.
Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that endoge-
nous Lats1 and 2 accumulate in the nuclear fraction, whereas
MST1 and Sav1 partition preferentially in the nonnuclear fraction
in normal mesothelial Met-5A cells (Figure 5A). In fact, similar
proportions of all of these signaling components were found in
the nonnuclear and the nuclear
fraction under sparse or
conﬂuent conditions (Figure 5A). Thus, although all of these com-
ponents may shuttle in and out of the nucleus, MST1 and Sav1
are present predominantly in the nonnuclear fraction and Lats1
and 2 in the nuclear fraction at a steady state. Immunoﬂuores-
cent staining with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against Lats1
conﬁrmed that Lats1 accumulates in the nucleus in the large ma-
jority of Met-5A cells. Intriguingly, however, it also detected a
fraction of the kinase at or near cell-to-cell junctions (Figure 5B).
In agreement with the observation that Meso-33 cells do not
express E-cadherin nor assemble adherens junctions, we did
not detect endogenous Lats1 at cell junctions or at the cell cortex
in these cells (Figure 5C), suggesting that deregulated
CRL4DCAF1 does not target Lats1 at the cell cortex in NF2-mutant
cells.

In the core Hippo kinase cassette, MST1 and 2 activate Lats1
by phosphorylating T1079. Activated Lats1 then undergoes
autophosphorylation at S909 (Chan et al., 2005). Immunoblotting
indicated that Lats1 becomes activated as YAP is phosphory-
lated and partially extruded from the nucleus in contact-inhibited
Met-5A cells, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of these antibodies (Fig-
ures S5A and S5B). Notably, subcellular fractionation revealed
that phosphorylated, active Lats1 accumulates almost exclu-
sively in the nucleus in these cells (Figure 5D). Similar results
were obtained with human liver epithelial HepG2 cells
(Figure S5C) and primary mouse fetal liver progenitor cells (Fig-
ure S5D). These observations raise the possibility that MST or
another upstream kinase moves into the nucleus to activate
Lats. Irrespective of the mechanism involved, the predominant
accumulation of CRL4DCAF1 and activated Lats in the nucleus
is consistent with the hypothesis that CRL4DCAF1 binds to Lats
and inhibits it in the nucleus.

Merlin Does Not Suppress Tumorigenesis from the Cell
Cortex
Having noted that Lats1 partially localizes to the cell cortex in
normal but not NF2-mutant cells (Figures 5B and 5C), we asked
whether
re-expression of Merlin modiﬁes the subcellular
localization of Lats1 in NF2-mutant cells. Upon transient trans-
fection and ensuing overexpression, wild-type Merlin localized
predominantly at lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂes in Meso-
33 cells, presumably as a consequence of saturation of the
nuclear import machinery, and it enhanced the recruitment of
endogenous Lats1 to these locales (Figure S5E). Overexpression
experiments indicated that HA-tagged Lats1 combines with

CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Oncogenesis by Inhibiting Lats

Figure 5. CRL4DCAF1 Inhibits Lats in the
Nucleus
(A) Total lysates, cytosolic and crude membrane
fractions (CM), and nuclear fractions (N)
from
sparse (Sp) or conﬂuent (Con) Met-5A cells were
immunoblotted as indicated.
(B and C) Sparse Met-5A cells and Meso-33 cells
were stained with an anti-Lats1 antibody and
DAPI. Scale bar, 20 mm.
(D) Endogenous Lats1 was immunoprecipitated
with an anti-Lats1 antibody from cytosolic and
crude membrane fractions and nuclear fractions
from sparse or conﬂuent Met5-A cells and
immunoblotted as indicated.
(E) HEK293T cells were transfected with empty
vector (HA Ctrl) or FLAG-HA-tagged Merlin (wild
type or its mutants) and were lysed 24 hr later in
RIPA buffer without SDS. FLAG immunoprecipi-
tates were washed using RIPA buffer without SDS.
FLAG immunoprecipitates and input were im-
munoblotted as indicated. Ctrl, control.
(F) Fold enrichment of immunoprecipitated DCAF1
and Lats1 was estimated by densitometry of blots
in (E), where enrichment is expressed as the total
density of the immunoprecipitated bands normal-
ized to their respective inputs.
(G) Meso-33 cells expressing Merlin or its mutants
were subjected to immunoblotting as indicated.
See also Figure S5.

FLAG-HA-tagged Merlin in HEK293T cells (Figure S5F), in agree-
ment with the recently proposed hypothesis that Merlin recruits
Lats to the plasma membrane to promote its activation (Yin
et al., 2013). Mutagenesis experiments indicated that the kinase
domain of Lats1 interacts with the C-terminal coiled-coil
segment of Merlin (Merlin 341–595) but not with its FERM domain
(Merlin 341X) (Figures S5F and S5G). Together with the results of
a recently published mutational analysis (Yin et al., 2013), these
results suggest that Merlin can recruit Lats at the plasma mem-
brane by binding through the N-terminal segment of its coiled-
coil domain to the kinase domain of Lats.

fail

To investigate the functional relevance of the interaction of
Merlin with Lats1, we tested four patient-derived missense mu-
tants that
to accumulate in the nucleus (L46R, L64P,
L141P, and A211D) and one that enters into the nucleus but
does not bind to DCAF1 (E270G) (Li et al., 2010). In addition,
we examined the two synthetic nuclear-defective mutants,
Merlin 24–27A and Merlin D24–27 (Figures 4A–4C). Coimmuno-
precipitation analysis indicated that
recombinant wild-type
Merlin combines with endogenous Lats1 much less efﬁciently
than with CRL4DCAF1 in an extraction buffer containing 0.5%
Triton X-100 but no ionic detergent (Figures 5E and 5F). In addi-
tion, although all nuclear-defective and patient-derived mutants
of Merlin failed to associate with DCAF1 in this assay, none of
them exhibited a reduced ability to interact with Lats1 (Figures
5E and 5F). Similar results were obtained by using radio-immu-
noprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Fig-
ure S5H), although we note that this buffer may unfold the
FERM domain of Merlin, exposing hydrophobic segments
(Mani et al., 2011). In agreement with these results, none of the

54 Cancer Cell 26, 48–60, July 14, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc.

patient-derived mutants exhibited a reduced ability to recruit
Lats1 to lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂes upon transient over-
expression in Meso-33 cells (Figure S5E). In contrast, they all
failed to induce phosphorylation of YAP at S127 (Figure 5G).
These ﬁndings support the conclusion that Merlin suppresses
tumorigenesis by inhibiting CRL4DCAF1 and, hence, stabilizing
activated Lats in the nucleus rather than by recruiting Lats to
the plasma membrane.

CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting Lats
To examine whether CRL4DCAF1 promotes oncogenesis by
activating YAP, we conducted genetic epistasis experiments.
As anticipated (Li et al., 2010), depletion of DCAF1 caused a
profound proliferation arrest
in Meso-33 cells (Figure 6A).
Notably, expression of wild-type YAP and of YAP-5SA, which
cannot be inactivated by Lats1/2 (Zhao et al., 2010b), rescued
the DCAF1-silenced tumor cells from proliferation arrest in a
manner proportional to their anticipated biological activity (Fig-
ure 6A). In addition, YAP-5SA enabled the DCAF1-silenced
FC-1801 cells to grow in soft agar and to form tumors upon sub-
cutaneous injection in nude mice (Figures 6B and 6C).

Next, we tested whether simultaneous depletion of Lats1 and
2 rescues the tumorigenic potential of DCAF1-silenced NF2-mu-
tant cells. Simultaneous silencing of Lats1 and 2 largely reversed
the proliferation arrest induced by depletion of DCAF1 in Meso-
33 cells (Figure 6D). In support of the speciﬁcity of this effect,
silencing of Lats1/2 did not enhance the ability of DCAF1-com-
petent cells to proliferate in this assay (Figure 6D). Furthermore,
silencing of Lats1/2 enabled DCAF1-depleted Meso-33 cells
to grow in soft agar as efﬁciently as those expressing DCAF1

YAP Signaling Sustain the Oncogenic Properties of Merlin-Deﬁcient

(F) Typical cell colonies in individual culture wells in the 24-well plate are

(Figures 6E and 6F). Similar results were obtained with FC-1801
cells (Figure S6A).

Finally, we examined whether silencing of Lats1/2 rescues the
tumorigenic ability of DCAF1-depleted FC-1801 cells. Intrigu-
ingly, silencing of Lats1/2 rescued the ability of DCAF1-depleted
schwannoma cells to form tumors to a very large extent (Fig-
ure 6G; Figure S6B). We consider this effect speciﬁc because
silencing of Lats1/2 alone did not increase tumor growth (Fig-
ures 6G; Figure S6B). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate
that derepression of CRL4DCAF1 promotes tumorigenesis
of NF2-mutant cells by inactivating Lats1/2 and, hence, acti-
vating YAP.

CRL4DCAF1 Promotes YAP-Dependent Oncogenic Gene
Expression in NF2 Mutant Tumors
To explore the clinical relevance of the signaling mechanism we
had identiﬁed, we ﬁrst examined a panel of 11 human malignant
mesothelioma cell lines carrying or not inactivating mutations at
the NF2 locus. Immunoblotting revealed that the NF2-mutant
lines exhibited severely diminished levels of Lats1 but not
Lats2 compared with NF2 wild-type lines (Figure 7A; Figure S7A).
In addition, all except one of the NF2-mutant cell lines displayed
decreased phosphorylation of YAP, and four of seven lines
displayed increased expression of the YAP target gene CTGF
(Figure 7A; Figure S7A). These results are consistent with the
conclusion that CRL4DCAF1 promotes the activation of YAP in
mesothelioma, at least in part, by increasing degradation of
Lats1.

To examine whether loss of NF2 induces YAP-dependent
oncogenic gene expression in clinical samples, we generated a
gene expression signature reﬂective of CRL4DCAF1-dependent
YAP activity. Because only simultaneous depletion of YAP and
TAZ induced Meso-33 cells to undergo a proliferation arrest as
profound as that induced by depletion of DCAF1 (Figure 7B; Fig-
ure S7B), we used a DNA microarray analysis to compare the
effect of inactivation of CRL4DCAF1 and simultaneous inactivation
of YAP and TAZ on gene expression. Although depletion of YAP
or TAZ did not lead to profound changes in gene expression in
Meso-33 cells, simultaneous depletion of both coactivators
caused a signiﬁcant decline in gene expression, conﬁrming
that YAP and TAZ function redundantly to control gene expres-
sion in mesothelioma cells (Figure 7C). Notably, silencing of
DCAF1 suppressed the expression of a large fraction of YAP/
TAZ target genes (39%) (Figures 7C and 7D; Figure S7C; Table
S2). An ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that these genes
comprise a large number of cell cycle genes controlled by the
RB-E2F network (Figure S7D; Tables S3 and S4). In addition,
silencing of DCAF1 enhanced the expression of a somewhat
smaller fraction of the genes repressed by YAP/TAZ (8%),
including some transforming growth factor b target genes (Fig-
ures 7C and 7D; Figure S7D; Tables S3 and S5). These results
indicate that CRL4DCAF1 controls a large fraction of the transcrip-
tional output of YAP in NF2-mutant cells.

(G) FC-1801 cells transduced with a control shRNA (top) or shRNAs targeting
Lats1/2 (bottom) were subsequently transduced with a control shRNA or a
shRNA targeting DCAF1 and were injected subcutaneously into nude mice.
Error bars show ± SEM. ***p < 0.001.

We next examined the gene expression proﬁles of 53 human
mesotheliomas, 39 of which harbored a mutation or genomic
loss at the NF2 locus (Bott et al., 2011). Unsupervised hierarchi-
cal clustering strongly suggested that the NF2-mutant mesothe-
liomas were endowed with a largely distinct gene expression
program (Figure S7E). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
revealed that CRL4DCAF1-activated genes were highly enriched
in NF2-mutant mesotheliomas compared with the remaining me-
sotheliomas (Figure 7E). Intriguingly, among DCAF1-activated
genes, those regulated via YAP and TAZ were enriched to an
even higher extent, whereas those genes activated by Yap or
TAZ alone were less enriched (Figure 7E). These results indicate
that CRL4DCAF1 controls YAP/TAZ-dependent gene expression
in NF2-mutant mesotheliomas.

To further examine the clinical relevance of our ﬁndings, we
studied additional NF2-mutant tumor types. First, we analyzed
primary human schwannoma cells freshly isolated from a pa-
tient affected by NF2. Prior studies had shown that re-expres-
sion of Merlin or silencing of DCAF1 suppresses the ability of
these cells to proliferate in vitro (Li et al., 2010; Schulze et al.,
2002). Interestingly, re-expression of Merlin and silencing of
DCAF1 induced a similar level of phosphorylation of YAP in

these cells (Figure 7F), suggesting that CRL4DCAF1 also controls
the output of the Hippo pathway in freshly explanted, patient-
derived NF2 mutant schwannoma cells. We then examined
activation of YAP in 40 human meningioma and vestibular
schwannoma samples classiﬁed as NF2-mutant or not by using
targeted genomic sequencing and immunoblotting with anti-
Merlin (Figure S7F and Table S6). Immunoblotting tumor lysates
with anti-p-YAP antibodies indicated that the level of phosphor-
ylation of YAP was signiﬁcantly lower in NF2-mutant tumors
compared with that of other tumors (Figure 7G; Figure S7F).
Finally, we examined the expression of YAP and phosphoryla-
tion of YAP on whole tissue sections of 31 meningiomas with
a sufﬁcient quality and quantity of
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-
embedded tissue available. We observed strong nuclear stain-
ing of tumor cells for YAP in 16 of 22 samples (73%) and no
staining in 6 of 22 samples (27%). In addition, we noted weak
to absent cytoplasmic staining of tumor cells for P-YAP in 12
of 23 samples (52%) and moderate to strong staining in 11 of
23 samples (48%) (Figure 7H; Table S6). There was a strong
positive correlation of nuclear YAP staining and weak or absent
cytoplasmic p-YAP staining in tumors with low Merlin expres-
sion (p = 0.001 for YAP and p = 0.001 for phospho-YAP,

CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Oncogenesis by Inhibiting Lats

Figure 8. Model Illustrating the Mechanism by which CRL4DCAF1
Promotes Oncogenesis
In Merlin-deﬁcient cells, CRL4DCAF1 promotes ubiquitylation of Lats1/2 and
suppresses phosphorylation and inactivation of YAP. YAP promotes TEAD-
dependent expression of proproliferative genes. It is likely that CRL4DCAF1
contributes to oncogenesis by ubiquitylating additional targets. In normal cells,
antimitogenic signals promote the accumulation of the dephosphorylated,
active form of Merlin. Upon translocation in the nucleus, this form of Merlin
binds to DCAF1 and suppresses CRL4DCAF1 activity. This model does not
exclude that Merlin activates the core Hippo kinase cascade by a distinct
mechanism.

Mann-Whitney U test), indicating that loss of Merlin causes
activation of YAP via reduced phosphorylation and increased
accumulation in the nucleus. These clinical ﬁndings corroborate
the hypothesis that CRL4DCAF1 inhibits Lats and, hence, acti-
vates YAP in NF2-mutant tumors.

DISCUSSION

Our results reveal that derepressed CRL4DCAF1 functions in the
nucleus of NF2-mutant cells to promote activation of YAP.
Mechanistically, CRL4DCAF1 binds directly to Lats1 and 2 and
directs their conjugation to ubiquitin. Although Lats1 is polyubi-
quitylated and targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation,
Lats2 is oligoubiquitylated at multiple sites, resulting in loss of
kinase activity. As a consequence, active YAP and TAZ accumu-
late in the nucleus and function redundantly to support the onco-
genic potential of NF2-mutant cells. These results indicate that
derepressed CRL4DCAF1 promotes tumorigenesis by inhibiting
Lats1 and 2 and, thus, promoting YAP/TAZ- and TEAD-depen-
dent transcription (Figure 8).

Genetic epistasis experiments in Drosophila have suggested
that Merlin cooperates with Expanded and Kibra to activate
the core Hippo kinase cassette (Halder and Johnson, 2011).
Although Merlin activates Hippo signaling and, thereby, also re-
stricts activation of YAP in mammalian cells (Zhao et al., 2007),
the molecular underpinnings of the connection of Merlin to the
Hippo pathway have remained unclear. Recent studies have
suggested that Merlin recruits Lats to the plasma membrane,
facilitating its activation by an upstream kinase distinct from
MST (Yin et al., 2013). Our results do not preclude the possibility
that Merlin limits the proliferation of normal cells—for example,

during contact
inhibition—by multiple, possibly redundant,
mechanisms, including those proposed above. However, they
indicate that Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis largely, if not
exclusively, by repressing CRL4DCAF1-dependent ubiquitylation
of Lats in the nucleus.

We observed that re-expression of Merlin induces phosphor-
ylation and inactivation of YAP in NF2-mutant cells without
increasing the levels of activation of MST1/2 or Lats1. In addi-
tion, Merlin-mediated inactivation of YAP proceeded unabated
in the absence of Sav1, which functions as an essential
adaptor linking MST1/2 to Lats1/2. These results suggest
that Merlin does not restrict the activation of YAP by engaging
the core kinase cassette but, rather, by regulating Lats1 and 2.
These observations are consistent with prior evidence sug-
gesting that Lats-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation
of YAP can occur independently of MST1/2 in certain mam-
malian tissues (Yu et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2009) and with a
more recent study suggesting that Merlin facilitates Lats acti-
vation by an unidentiﬁed upstream kinase distinct from MST
(Yin et al., 2013).

The results of our biochemical studies suggest that CRL4DCAF1
employs distinct mechanisms to inhibit Lats1 and 2. Upon
DCAF1-mediated recruitment to the ligase complex, Lats1 is
polyubiquitylated and, hence, targeted for proteasome-medi-
ated degradation.
In contrast, Lats2 is oligoubiquitylated at
multiple sites, including at lysines in the kinase domain, near
the Mob1-binding site, and near the PPXY motif required for
interaction with YAP. Presumably as a result of these multiple
modiﬁcations, Lats2 becomes inactive. Future studies will be
required to determine the impact of each one of these modiﬁ-
cations on the kinase activity of Lats2 and its interaction with
substrates or necessary cofactors. Notably, both Lats1 and
Lats2 possess an N-terminal UBA domain, suggesting the
possibility that an intramolecular association of this domain
with a C-terminal ubiquitylated sequence motif may contribute
to maintain the two kinases in an inactive state in NF2-mutant
tumor cells.

To examine the relevance of CRL4DCAF1-mediated inhibition of
Lats1/2 in NF2 loss-driven oncogenesis, we reconstituted NF2-
mutant cells with wild-type and mutant forms of Merlin. Deletion
or alanine substitution of a short nuclear localization sequence
prevented Merlin from interacting with CRL4DCAF1 and from
suppressing the activation of YAP and cell proliferation.
Conversely, tamoxifen-induced translocation of ERT2-Merlin in
the nucleus and binding to CRL4DCAF1 resulted in the inhibition
of YAP and cell proliferation. Furthermore, analysis of a large
panel of patient-derived missense mutants of Merlin, which do
not combine with CRL4DCAF1 as a result of their inability to enter
into the nucleus and/or to bind to the Merlin-binding segment of
DCAF1 (Li et al., 2010), revealed that all of them exhibit a severely
reduced capacity to inhibit the activation of YAP and cell prolif-
eration. Finally, in vitro and in vivo genetic epistasis experiments
demonstrated that YAP and TAZ are necessary to maintain the
oncogenicity of NF2-mutant tumor cells and that simultaneous
inactivation of Lats1 and 2 rescues the oncogenicity of DCAF1-
depleted NF2-mutant tumor cells. In our view, these results
provide strong genetic evidence that Merlin suppresses tumori-
genesis by inhibiting CRL4DCAF1 and, hence, increasing the
levels of active Lats in the nucleus.

Cancer Cell
CRL4DCAF1 Promotes Oncogenesis by Inhibiting Lats

We validated the relevance of our ﬁndings for human tumori-
genesis by using a variety of approaches. First, genetic manipu-
lation indicated that re-expression of Merlin and silencing of
DCAF1 inhibit activation of YAP and cell proliferation in primary
schwannoma cells from NF2 patients. Second, immunoblotting
and immunostaining of meningioma and vestibular schwannoma
samples revealed a striking correlation between the loss of
Merlin and the activation of YAP. Third, analysis of a panel of
human mesothelioma lines indicated that deletion of NF2 corre-
lates with reduced levels of Lats1 protein and increased
activation of YAP. Finally, GSEA demonstrated that the gene
expression program regulated by CRL4DCAF1 through activation
of YAP/TAZ is highly enriched in NF2-mutant mesotheliomas
compared with those lacking NF2 alterations.

We note that simultaneous depletion of Lats1 and 2 did not
completely rescue the ability of DCAF1-silenced NF2-mutant
cells to overproliferate in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that
CRL4DCAF1 may have additional substrates that contribute to
its pro-oncogenic function. RORa, which has been identiﬁed
recently as a CRL4DCAF1 substrate and exhibits severely reduced
expression in human breast cancers (Lee et al., 2012), is a poten-
tial candidate, but other, still unidentiﬁed substrates may
contribute as well. These considerations suggest that entry of
Merlin into the nucleus and inhibition of CRL4DCAF1 may have
evolved to limit not only the activation of YAP but also that of
additional pro-oncogenic signals. In addition to their biological
implications,
these ﬁndings indicate that pharmacological
targeting of CRL4DCAF1 is a rational approach for the treatment
of neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 and malignant pleural mesotheli-
oma. We suggest that, because CRL4DCAF1 may promote onco-
genesis through multiple mechanisms, CRL4DCAF1 inhibitors
may display enhanced efﬁcacy in NF2-mutant tumors compared
with drugs that interfere with the interaction of YAP with TEAD
(Jiao et al., 2014; Liu-Chittenden et al., 2012).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Patients and Tumor Samples
Human studies were approved by the institutional review boards of MSKCC,
NYU-Langone Medical Center, and the Plymouth University Peninsula
School of Medicine and Dentistry (see details in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).

Subcellular Fractionation
Nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and
cytoplasmic extraction reagents following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).

Immunoﬂuorescent Staining
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with
0.3% sodium deoxycholate and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. After
blocking with 5% BSA, samples were incubated overnight at 4
C with primary

In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay
Afﬁnity-puriﬁed recombinant proteins,
including E1 (Calbiochem), E2
(UBCH5c), GST-Cul4A, His-Rbx1, GST-DDB1, His-ubiquitin, and FLAG-hem-
agglutinin (FH)-DCAF1 and FH-Lats1 (puriﬁed from HEK293T cells) were incu-
bated in 20 ml reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM

Based on the apparently prevalent

localization of Hippo
pathway components at the cell cortex or in the cytoplasm in
Drosophila, it has been proposed that activated Lats phosphor-
ylates YAP in the cytoplasm, preventing its accumulation in the
nucleus through redundant mechanisms, such as binding to
14-3-3 or b-TRCP-mediated ubiquitylation (Dong et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2007, 2010b). Consistently, overexpressed tagged
forms of Lats1 and 2 accumulate predominantly in the cytosol
or at centrosomes, respectively (Toji et al., 2004; Yang et al.,
2004), whereas a mutant form of YAP that cannot be phosphor-
ylated by Lats accumulates in the nucleus and promotes TEAD-
dependent transcription and oncogenesis (Zhao et al., 2007).
Because overexpression can saturate the nuclear
import
machinery and exogenous tags can interfere with transport
into the nucleus of recombinant proteins, we examined the local-
ization of endogenous Lats in mammalian cells by using immu-
noﬂuorescence staining and subcellular fractionation. We found
that endogenous Lats accumulates in the nucleus independently
of growth conditions. Importantly, phosphorylated and activated
Lats was almost exclusively found in the nucleus. These obser-
vations suggest that MST1/2 or another unidentiﬁed upstream
kinase phosphorylates and activate Lats in the nucleus. Acti-
vated Lats, in turn, phosphorylates YAP, promoting its extrusion
from the nucleus.

Our results do not exclude the possibility that Merlin may have
additional functions at the cell cortex and, in fact, may also regu-
late the Hippo pathway from this location. Of note, we observed
that Merlin can bind, albeit weakly, to Lats1 and Lats2, and we
detected a fraction of Lats1 near the plasma membrane in
normal mesothelial cells undergoing contact-mediated inhibi-
tion of proliferation. However, in contrast to the results of a
more limited but similar analysis (Yin et al., 2013), we found
that mutations that abolish the tumor suppressor function of
Merlin do not interfere with its ability to bind to Lats1 and recruit
it to the cell cortex. However, they consistently fail to bind to
CRL4DCAF1 and to inactivate YAP. These results conﬁrm that
Merlin’s function at the cell cortex is insufﬁcient to suppress
tumorigenesis.

We speculate that the signaling pathway we have delineated
may have evolved after the separation of chordates from arthro-
pods to provide additional control over the function of YAP. In
fact, Drosophila Merlin contains a glycine residue at the position
corresponding to E270 in human Merlin, a substitution that is
predicted to abolish interaction with DCAF1 (Li et al., 2010).
Moreover, the Drosophila ortholog of DCAF1, Mahjong (Tamori
et al., 2010), does not contain a C-terminal Merlin-binding
segment. These considerations suggest that the interaction of
Merlin with CRL4DCAF1 has evolved in chordates to function as
a clamp to restrain activation of YAP. In this model, Merlin and
CRL4DCAF1 act as a negative and a positive component of a
switch that ﬁne-tunes the activation of YAP in mammalian cells.
Inactivation of NF2 eliminates the clamp, causing deregulated
YAP/TEAD-dependent transcription of prosurvival and mito-
genic genes. It remains to be examined whether this clamp on
the activation of YAP also operates during development to limit
stem cell self-renewal, organ size, and cell fate speciﬁcation,
as is anticipated from the known physiological
function of
YAP and its deregulation following inactivation of NF2 during
tumorigenesis.
