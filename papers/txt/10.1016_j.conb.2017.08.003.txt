Dopaminergic  dysfunction  in  neurodevelopmental
disorders:  recent  advances  and  synergistic
technologies  to  aid  basic  research
J  Elliott  Robinson  and  Viviana  Gradinaru

Neurodevelopmental  disorders  (NDDs)  represent  a  diverse
group  of  syndromes  characterized  by  abnormal  development
of  the  central  nervous  system  and  whose  symptomatology
includes  cognitive,  emotional,  sensory,  and  motor
impairments.  The  identiÔ¨Åcation  of  causative  genetic  defects
has  allowed  for  creation  of  transgenic  NDD  mouse  models  that
have  revealed  pathophysiological  mechanisms  of  disease
phenotypes  in  a  neural  circuit-  and  cell  type-speciÔ¨Åc  manner.
Mouse  models  of  several  syndromes,  including  Rett
syndrome,  Fragile  X  syndrome,  Angelman  syndrome,
NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis  type  1,  etc.,  exhibit  abnormalities  in  the
structure  and  function  of  dopaminergic  circuitry,  which
regulates  motivation,  motor  behavior,  sociability,  attention,
and  executive  function.  Recent  advances  in  technologies  for
functional  circuit  mapping,  including  tissue  clearing,  viral
vector-based  tracing  methods,  and  optical  readouts  of  neural
activity,  have  reÔ¨Åned  our  knowledge  of  dopaminergic  circuits
in  unperturbed  states,  yet  these  tools  have  not  been  widely
applied  to  NDD  research.  Here,  we  will  review  recent  Ô¨Åndings
exploring  dopaminergic  function  in  NDD  models  and  discuss
the  promise  of  new  tools  to  probe  NDD  pathophysiology  in
these  circuits.

Introduction
In  the  last  decade,  the  widespread  adoption  of  technolo-
gies  for  functional  circuit  mapping  in  animal  models  has
greatly  enhanced  our  ability  to  understand  the  input‚Äì
output  relationships  between  populations  of  neurons  and
vivo.  These  include  techni-
determine  their  function 
ques  for  the  visualization,  reconstruction,  and  analysis  of

intact  circuits  across  micro-  and  macroscales.  Examples
include  serial  section  electron  microscopy  [1,2],  the
Brainbow  toolkit  [3,4]  and  intersectional  labeling  strate-
gies  [5
],  improved  neuroinformatic  tools  for  neurite
tracing  [7],  tissue  clearing  [8,9],  light  sheet  microscopy

[10,11
],  and  serial  two-photon  tomography  [12,13].  Addi-
tionally,  optogenetic  [14]  and  chemogenetic  [15]  actua-
tors,  genetically  encoded  indicators  of  neuronal  activity
[16,17],  and  advanced 
  imaging  modalities  [18‚Äì23]
have  allowed  for  the  functional  deconstruction  of  geneti-
cally  deÔ¨Åned  circuits  in  order  to  probe  their  contributions
to  complex  behaviors.  The  development  of  viral  vectors
that  can  deliver  transgenes  in  a  pathway-  and  cell  type-
speciÔ¨Åc  manner  [24,25,26
,27,28]  or  broadly  transduce
neurons  across  the  CNS  [29
]  have  greatly  facilitated
efforts  to  anatomically  and  functionally  characterize  com-
plex  neurobiological  systems  in  both  basal  and  disease
states.

New  tools  for  ‚Äòconnectomic‚Äô  or  circuit-centered  research
that  can  survey  large  scale  functional  connectivity  pat-
terns  are  particularly  well  suited  to  the  study  of  neuro-
developmental  disorders  (NDDs),  such  as  autism  spec-
trum  disorder 
(ASD),  where  diverse  genetic  and
environmental 
insults  during  neurodevelopment  can
perturb  circuit  architecture  and  physiology  across  brain
areas  [30,31].  While  the  neural  substrates  of  ASD  symp-
tomatology  are  multifaceted,  mesencephalic  dopamine
systems,  consisting  of  A8  retrorubral,  A9  nigrostriatal,
and  A10  mesocorticolimbic  projections  [32],  represent
circuits  of  interest  given  their  potential  contribution  to
several  common  ASD  symptoms,  including  perseverant
interests,  stereotyped  movements,  impaired  attention
and  executive  function,  and  difÔ¨Åculty  with  social  inter-
actions  [33].  Several  recent  studies  implicate  these  cir-
cuits  in  behavioral  phenotypes  observed  in  rodent  NDD
disease  models,  including  Angelman  syndrome  (AS),
Rett  syndrome  (RS),  fragile  X  syndrome  (FXS),  neuro-
Ô¨Åbromatosis  type  1  (NF1),  etc.  (Table  1),  yet  wide-
spread  adoption  of  new  tools  for  functional  circuit
mapping  has  yet  to  occur  in  these  models.  In  this
review,  we  will  highlight  common  patterns  of  cellular
and  circuit  level  phenotypic  variation  across  NDD
mouse  models  and  discuss  the  promise  of  recent  neu-
rotechnological  advances  such  as  whole  brain  tissue
clearing  and  gene  delivery  by  systemic  viral  vectors  to
further  elucidate  NDD  pathophysiology  in  dopami-
nergic  circuits  (Figure  1,  Table  1).

Current Opinion in Neurobiology

Elucidating  abnormal  patterns  of
dopaminergic  connectivity  in  NDD  models
Dopaminergic  projection  neurons  are  a  heterogeneous
population  whose  function,  activity,  neurotransmitter
content,  and  pattern  of  connectivity  varies  by  brain  region
and  connection  target  [34‚Äì36].  For  example,  efferents
arising  from  the  midbrain  ventral  tegmental  area  (VTA)
project  throughout  the  extended  amygdala  [including  the
nucleus  accumbens  (NAc)],  hippocampus,  and  prefrontal
cortex  (the  mesocorticolimbic  pathway)  and  have  been
widely  studied  for  their  role  in  cognition,  reinforcement,
and  motivation  [37,38],  while  dopaminergic  populations
in  the  substantia  nigra  pars  compacta  (SNc)  project  pri-
marily  to  the  dorsal  striatum  (nigrostriatal  pathway)  and
are  critical  for  the  selection  and  execution  of  motor
programs  and  habitual  behavior  [39,40].  Other  popula-
tions  outside  the  mesencephalon  include  those  in  the
dorsal  raphe  nucleus  (DRN)/ventral  periaqueductal  gray
area  (vPAG)  that  affect  social  behavior,  nociception,  and
arousal  [41‚Äì43]  and  tuberoinfundibular  projections  from
the  hypothalamic  arcuate  nucleus  to  the  median  emi-
nence  that  regulate  prolactin  release  [44].

Mesencephalic  dopaminergic  neurons  in  mice  arise  from
a  pool  of  progenitors  in  the  midbrain  Ô¨Çoor  plate  under  the
control  of  numerous  signaling  molecules,  including  sonic

EN2, 

MECP2, 

CNTNAP2,  and 

hedgehog,  WNT1,  engrailed  1  and  2,  Ô¨Åbroblast  growth
factor-8,  etc.,  undergo  radial  migration  to  their  Ô¨Ånal  posi-
tions  in  either  the  VTA  or  SNc  by  embryonic  day  13.5,
and  exhibit  extensive  axonal  outgrowth  along  the  ante-
roposterior  and  dorsoventral  axes  with  synaptogenesis  in
downstream  targets  continuing  into  postnatal  develop-
ment  [45].  Consequently  loss  of  NDD-associated  genes,
NF1,  produce
such  as 
hypo-  or  hyperdopaminergic  behavioral  phenotypes,  such
as  abnormal  motor,  cognitive,  or  social  behavior,  in  mouse
models  by  perturbing  neuronal  maturation,  migration,  or
neurite  outgrowth  [46‚Äì53].  Efforts  to  understand  these
phenotypes  would  beneÔ¨Åt  from  a  comprehensive  ultra-
structural  understanding  of  how  speciÔ¨Åc  NDD-associated
genetic  changes  alter  dopaminergic  circuit  architecture
and  function  and  inform  new  therapeutic  strategies,  such
as  brainwide  gene  therapy  or  genome  editing,  to  help
ameliorate  NDD  symptomatology.

Several  recent  viral  vector-based  labeling  methods  are
likely  to  greatly  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  input‚Äì
output  relationship  between  dopaminergic  efferent  and
afferent  connections  in  NDD  models  (Table  2A).  This
toolkit  includes  a  new  adenoassociated  viral  (AAV)  vector

Major Ô¨Åndings

Triplication of Ube3a synergizes with seizures to reduce expression of the glutamatergic synapse organizer Cbln1, impairs
glutamatergic transmission in VTA neurons, and leads to loss of sociability.

Mice carrying a homologous chromosomal deletion to 16p11.2 (7F3) exhibit abnormal synaptic signaling and increased numbers of
dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, fewer D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing neurons
in the cortex, locomotor hyperactivity, and deÔ¨Åcits in motor control.

Ube3am-/p+ mice display enhanced electrically evoked dopamine release in the NAc and reward seeking but decreased sensitivity to
drugs that increase dopamine overÔ¨Çow.
Loss of maternal Ube3a in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons enhanced optical self-stimulation via increased GABA
release from dopaminergic terminals in the NAc.

 /y mice are more sensitive to the rewarding effects but less sensitive to the motor effects of cocaine compared to wildtype; the

Fmr1
number of TH-expressing neurons is reduced in the SNc but not VTA of these mice.
Locomotor sensitization, conditioned place preference, and synaptic changes in the NAc following repeated cocaine is reduced in
Fmr1

 /y mice.

 / 

Shank3 shRNA knockdown Shank3 knockdown via short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in the VTA impairs excitatory synapse maturation, reduces dopaminergic neuron
excitability via increased inhibitory tone, reduces social preference, and can be rescued an mGluR1 agonist or optogenetic stimulation
of dopaminergic neurons.
Loss of Shank3b alters the development of excitatory inputs to medium spiny neurons of the dorsomedial striatum, which can be
rescued by chemogenetic inhibition of corticostriatal inputs.
Loss of Shank3b in a conditional knock-in model results in abnormal motor, social, and exploratory behaviors; repetitive grooming; and
synaptic changes in the striatum. These deÔ¨Åcits are rescued with germline re-activation of Shank3 expression.

A  recombinant  AAV2  variant  for  retrograde  targeting  of  projection  neurons  that  can  be  used  for  both
functional  and  tracing  studies.  EfÔ¨Åcient  retrograde  transduction  was  observed  in  many  cortical  and
subcortical  regions.
AAV9-based  vectors  for  efÔ¨Åcient  CNS  (PHP.eB)  or  PNS  (PHP.S)  transduction  after  peripheral
(intravenous  or  retro-orbital)  virus  administration.  Can  be  used  with  a  titratable  inducer  vector  for
controlled  sparseness  of  multicolor  labels  that  preserves  color  diversity;  inducers  involve  use  of
tetracycline-controlled  transactivator  (tTA)  or  Cre-dependent  Flp-based  constructs.
Tracing  the  relationship  between  input  and  output;  A  combinatorial  two-vector  system  that  maps  the
input‚Äìoutput  relationship  of  a  population  of  neurons.  In  this  method,  canine  adenovirus-2  (CAV-2)
[25]  is  used  to  deliver  a  Flp  recombinase  transgene  to  axons  in  a  speciÔ¨Åc  projection  terminal  Ô¨Åeld  for
retrograde  transduction  of  the  cell  bodies;  Flp-dependent  RVdG  [24]  component  vectors  are  later
delivered  to  the  cell  bodies  for  monosynaptic  retrograde  tracing  of  inputs.  Cre-dependent  Flp  can  be
used  for  cell  type-speciÔ¨Åc  targeting  using  a  Cre  driver  line  (cTRIO).  Cannot  be  used  for  functional
studies  due  to  lethality  of  RVdG.
Intronic  recombinase  sites  enabling  combinatory  targeting;  A  two-component  system  that  allows  for
functional  projection  targeting  using  Flp-dependent  and  Cre-dependent  viral  vectors  via  axonal
targeting  in  a  downstream  region  using  replication  incompetent  herpes  simplex  virus  (HSV)  [27]
carrying  a  Cre-dependent  Flp  recombinase  transgene.  Either  Cre-  or  Flp-ON  or  OFF  strategies  can
be  used.
Multiplexed  analysis  of  projections  by  sequencing;  A  method  that  allows  for  parallel  mapping  of  single
neuron  axonal  arbors  via  recovery  of  RNA  barcodes  in  from  terminal  Ô¨Åelds  after  delivery  of  AAV  viral
barcode  libraries  to  the  cell  body.  Does  not  distinguish  Ô¨Åbers  of  passage,  so  downstream  regions
must  be  chosen  carefully  for  RNA  recovery  and  sequencing.
Mammalian  GFP  reconstitution  across  synaptic  partners;  A  method  for  Ô¨Çuorescently  labeling  synaptic
connections  that  employs  AAV-mediated  delivery  of  synapse-targeted  split  GFP  fragments  in
genetically  deÔ¨Åned  pre-synaptic  and  post-synaptic  neuronal  partners.  Cre-ON  and  Cre-OFF
strategies  can  be  used  for  studying  microcircuits.

Originally  developed  over  100  years  ago,  LSM  illuminates  the  sample  with  a  thin  sheet  of  light  and
detects  the  emitted  Ô¨Çuorescent  signal  with  an  orthogonally  arranged  detection  objective.  Variants
include  CLARITY  optimized  LSM  (COLM)  for  use  in  cleared  tissue  [76],  SPED  (Spherical  Aberration-
assisted  Extended  Depth  of  Field)  LSM  that  improves  scan  speed  via  extended  depth  of  Ô¨Åeld  [68],
and  an  adaptive  LSM  that  integrates  multiple  Ô¨Åelds  of  view  with  10  degrees  of  freedom  that  are

autonomously  adjusted  in  real  time  for  improved  spatial  resolution  and  image  quality  [11
High-speed  volumetric  serial  two-photon  tomography;  A  high  speed  imaging  platform  based  on
Serial  Two-Photon  Tomography  (STP)  [13]  that  creates  3D  reconstructions  of  neuronal  axonal  arbors
via  the  integration  of  fast  volumetric  2-photon  microscopy  and  a  vibrating  microtome  to  image  bright,
sparsely  labeled  neurons  in  cleared  samples  embedded  in  gelatin.  Includes  computational  tools  for
the  registration  and  visualization  of  large  (up  to  100  TB)  data  sets,  although  labeling  must  be
sufÔ¨Åciently  sparse  to  prevent  neurite  reconstruction  errors  when  axons  from  different  neurons  are
closely  positioned.

Summary 

Citation

A  whole-body  clearing  method  based  on  3DISCO;  it  utilizes  dehydration  with  tert-butanol  followed  by
delipidation  with  diphenyl  ether  for  fast  sample  clearing.  Maintenance  of  endogenous  Ô¨Çuorescence  is
improved  relative  to  3DISCO  and  other  solvent  based  methods,  whereby  Ô¨Çuorescence  deteriorates
within  several  days  after  clearing.  Shrinks  tissues  by  approximately  40%  for  faster  LSM  imaging.
An  improved  version  of  Sca/eA2  [168]  that  achieves  tissue  transparency  via  partial  delipidation  and
hyperhydration  via  urea,  sorbitol,  glycerol,  and  Triton  X-100.  Preserves  endogenous  Ô¨Çuorescence
and  limits  expansion  better  than  most  other  methods,  although  large  sample  clearing  can  take
several  weeks.  A  simpliÔ¨Åed  protocol  Sca/eSQ  can  be  used  in  thick  (<500  micron)  sections.
Clear,  unobstructed,  brain/body  imaging  cocktails  and  computational  analysis;  A  clearing  method
based  on  Sca/eA2  that  uses  urea,  aminoalcohols,  TRITON  X-100,  and  high  sucrose  concentrations.
Maintains  endogenous  Ô¨Çuorescence,  can  be  perfused  for  whole  body  clearing,  produces  reversible
tissue  expansion,  and  exhibits  superior  decolorization  (i.e.  loss  of  the  heme  chromophore)  relative  to
other  techniques.

include  immersion  clearing  with  high  refractive  index
(RI)  solutions  (SeeDB  [69],  FRUIT  [70],  RIMS  [71]),

hydrogel  embedding  followed  by  detergent  delipidation
(CLARITY  [75,76],  PARS  [77,78],  PACT  [77,78]),  and
solvent-based  clearing  methods  (uDISCO  [79]).  Clear-

also  been  implemented  to  facilitate  high  resolution
imaging  of  small  structures,  such  as  individual  dendrites
or  neurites  (ExM  [80‚Äì82],  ePACT  [78],  and  MAP  [83]).
Hydrogel-based  methods  preserve  endogenous  Ô¨Çuores-

Considerations  and  future  outlook
The  identiÔ¨Åcation  of  causative  genetic  defects  in  neuro-
developmental  syndromes  and  subsequent  creation  of
transgenic  mouse  models  has  greatly  enhanced  our  under-
standing  of  the  developmental  perturbations  that  produce
synaptic,  cellular,  and  behavioral  phenotypes  in  these
mice.  While  several  recent  studies  examining  dopami-
nergic  circuitry  have  uncovered  pathophysiological  mech-
anisms  underlying  aberrant  social  interactions,  positive
reinforcement,  stereotyped  behavior,  etc.,  few  studies
have  employed  new  technologies  for  functional  circuit
mapping  in  NDD  models.  This  may  be  due  to  several
factors;  Ô¨Årst,  given  that  phenotype  expression  is  depen-
dent  on  genetic  background  in  many  mouse  models,  such
as  NF1  [143],  it  will  be  important  to  continue  identifying
and  developing  minimal  gene  regulatory  elements  (pro-
moters,  enhancers,  miRNA  binding  sites)  that  can  be
accommodated  within  well-tolerated  viral  capsids  for  cell
type-speciÔ¨Åc  targeting  without  the  need  to  cross  mice  to
Cre  or  Flp  driver  lines.  Several  cell  type-speciÔ¨Åc  promo-
ters  have  been  developed  to  target  different  cell  popula-
tions  in  the  CNS,  including  catecholaminergic  (tyrosine
hydroxylase  promoter),  serotonergic 
(FEV),  Purkinje
(PCP2)  [144],  and  forebrain  GABAergic  (mDlx5/6)  neu-
rons  [145],  although  they  vary  in  leakiness  and  promoter
size,  which  can  limit  packageable  transgene  size  due  to
the  AAV  carrying  capacity  of  4.7  kb  [146].  Second,  many
require  specialized  equipment,
of 
reagents,  or  expertise  that  makes  implementation  chal-
lenging.  Several  helpful  imaging,  tissue  clearing,  and  data
analysis  protocols  have

arbors  that  traverse  several  mm  of  brain  tissue.  Recent
successes  in  overcoming  these  challenges  include  the
reconstruction  of  single  projection  neurons  in  the  claus-
trum,  which  branch  extensively  throughout  the  entire
cerebrum  [150].  Second,  we  will  need  improved  tools
for  converting  neural  activity  states  into  Ô¨Çuorescent  labels
that  can  be  superimposed  upon  neuronal  reconstructions.
Several  technologies  show  promise,  such  as  CaMPARI
[151]  and  iTANGO  [152
],  which  provide  light  time-
stamped  indicators  of  intracellular  calcium  or  dopaminer-
gic  neurotransmission,  respectively.  Hybridization  chain

ITY  [86],  and  Ex-FISH  [81]  have  been  demonstrated  to
be  compatible  with  RNA  proÔ¨Åling,  yet  clearing  methods
are  advancing  rapidly  and  will  likely  be  useful  for  a
broader  range  of  applications  in  the  future.

When  examining  the  role  of  functional  circuit  mapping
technologies  in  elucidating  dopaminergic  connectivity  in
NDD  models,  one  cannot  neglect  the  ontogeny  of  these
circuits.  Several  methods  have  been  used  to  clear  mouse
embryos  at  various  stages  of  development  (reviewed  by
[154]),  yet  it  is  difÔ¨Åcult  to  employ  viral  vector-based
tracing  and  labeling  techniques  in  the  developing  mouse.
It  is  thus  of  great  interest  to  identify  AAVs  that  cross  the
blood-placenta  barrier  and  selectively  target  the  develop-
ing  embryonic  nervous  system.  AAV  selection  platforms,
such  as  CREATE  (Cre  recombination-based  AAV  tar-
geted  evolution),  which  has  been  used  to  develop  vectors
that  efÔ¨Åciently  target  the  central  (PHP.B/PHP.eB)  or
]  when
peripheral  (PHP.S)  nervous  systems  [29
,57
in

given  systemically,  could  yield  new  vectors  for 
transgene  delivery.  Additionally,  tools  for  large  volume
functional  imaging  of  developing  organisms,  such  as  a
two-beam  light  sheet  microscope  with  adaptive  optics  and
automated  cell  tracking  [11
],  have  been  applied  to  early
embryonic  mice  [155,156],  yet  new  methods  to  maintain
optical  access  within  the  amnion  will  be  necessary  to
image  and  track  post-implantation  fetal  cells.

Going  forward,  we  anticipate  that  continued  technologi-

comprehensive  functional  and  connectomic  maps  of
dopaminergic  circuitry  across  development.  As  these  tools
become  more  widely  adopted  by  NDD  researchers,  we
will  likely  gain  newfound  understanding  of  how  func-
tional  and  structural  abnormalities  synergize  to  produce
behavioral  and  cognitive  phenotypes  in  mouse  models
and  reveal  putative  mechanisms  of  disease  symptomatol-

The  authors  used  RVDg  tracing,  clearing  with  CLARITY,  and  whole  brain
light-sheet  microscopy  to  map  inputs  to  VTA  and  SNc  neurons  projecting
to  different  projection  sites.  Projection-dependent  rabies  tracing  was
achieved  via  retrograde  expression  of  the  rabies  cognate  receptor
(TVA)  through  the  retrograde  activity  of  AAV5.  The  authors  found  that
most  starter  sites  produced  similar  patterns  of  inputs  from  the  ventral
striatum,  except  for  the  posterior  striatum;  this  region  produced  relatively
more  inputs  from  the  globus  pallidus,  subthalamic  nucleus,  and  zona
incerta.  Additionally,  the  authors  created  an  automated  workÔ¨Çow  for
image  acquisition,  atlas  registration,  neuron  segmentation,  and  quanti-
Ô¨Åcation  of  labelled  cells  in  cleared  brains.

Menegas  et  al.  compared  bulk  calcium  activity  across  striatal  subclasses
using  Ô¨Åber  photometry  during  a  classical  conditioning  task.  While  ventral
striatal  neurons  showed  activation  only 
in  response  to  rewards  and
reward-predictive  cues,  the  posterior  tail  of  the  striatum,  a  region  their
group  had  previously  demonstrated  to  be  an  anatomically  distinct  sub-
class  via  rabies  mapping 
in  CLARITY-cleared  brains,  showed  strong
activation  to  novel  cues  regardless  or  reward  state,  as  well  as  responses
to  aversive  and  neutral  stimuli.

inputs  to  the  medial  NAc-projecting  dopaminergic  neurons  were  biased

more  inputs  from  the  dorsal  striatum,  NAc  core,  and  anterior  cingulate
