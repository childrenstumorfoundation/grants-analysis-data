ABSTRACT: Type-2 NF1 deletions spanning 1.2 Mb are
frequently of postzygotic origin and hence tend to be asso-
ciated with mosaicism for normal cells and those harboring
the deletion (del(+/−) cells). Eleven patients with mosaic
type-2 deletions were investigated by FISH and high pro-
portions (94–99%) of del(+/−) cells were detected both
in whole blood and in isolated CD3+, CD14+, CD15+,
and CD19+ leukocytes. Signiﬁcantly lower proportions of
del(+/−) cells (24-82%) were however noted in urine-
derived epithelial cells. A patient harboring an atypical
large NF1 deletion with nonrecurrent breakpoints was
also found to have a much higher proportion of del(+/−)
cells in blood (96%) than in urine (51%). The tissue-
speciﬁc differences in the proportions of del(+/−) cells as
well as the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns ob-
served in these mosaic patients suggest that the majority
of the deletions had occurred before or during the preim-
plantation blastocyst stage before the onset of XCI. We
postulate that hematopoietic del(+/−) stem cells present
at an early developmental stage are characterized by a se-
lective growth advantage over normal cells lacking the
deletion, leading to a high proportion of del(+/−) cells in
peripheral blood from the affected patients.

type 1 (NF1; MIM# 613113) [Kluwe et al., 2004]. Four distinct
types of NF1 deletion (type-1, type-2, type-3, and atypical) have
been identiﬁed that are distinguishable in terms of the extent of
the deleted region and the location of their respective breakpoints.
Type-1 NF1 deletions encompass 1.4 Mb (including 14 genes) with
breakpoints that are located within low-copy repeats, termed NF1-
REPa and NF1-REPc [Dorschner et al., 2000; Jenne et al., 2001;
L ´opez-Correa et al., 2001]. Type-1 deletions are detected in 70–80%
of all patients with large NF1 deletions and hence represent the most
frequent NF1 deletion type [Messiaen et al., 2011; Pasmant et al.,
2010]. By contrast, type-2 deletions occur much less frequently,
their estimated frequency being 9–20% of all large NF1 deletions
[Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2004; Messiaen et al., 2011; Pasmant et al.,
2010]. Type-2 NF1 deletions are also smaller, spanning 1.2 Mb
and including only 13 genes. The breakpoints of type-2 deletions
are located within SUZ12 and its pseudogene SUZ12P [Kehrer-
Sawatzki et al., 2004; Petek et al., 2003; Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann
et al., 2007]. A third type of recurrent NF1 deletion (type-3) has
been reported recently [Bengesser et al., 2010; Pasmant et al., 2010;
Zickler et al., 2011]. Type-3 deletions encompass 1.0 Mb and include
9 genes, with breakpoints located within the LRRC37B-P paralogs
of NF1-REPb and NF1-REPc. Type-3 NF1 deletions are rare, being
observed in only 1–4% of patients with NF1 deletions [Messiaen
et al., 2011; Pasmant et al., 2010]. In addition to these three types
of recurrent NF1 deletion, mediated in most instances by nonallelic
homologous recombination (NAHR), a number of atypical NF1
deletions have also been identiﬁed with nonrecurrent breakpoints
[Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2003, 2005, 2008; Mantripragada et al., 2006;
Messiaen et al., 2011; Pasmant et al., 2009, 2010]. By deﬁnition,
atypical NF1 deletions are heterogeneous in terms of their size,
breakpoint position, and the number of genes included within the
deleted region.

Mosaicism with normal cells is an important issue to address in
NF1 patients with large NF1 deletions because it can inﬂuence both
the phenotypic expression of the disease and the transmission risk
[Erickson, 2010; Gottlieb et al., 2001; Kehrer-Sawatzki and Cooper,
2008; Youssouﬁan and Pyeritz, 2002]. It has been estimated that mo-
saicism with normal cells occurs in at least 10% of patients with NF1
microdeletions [Messiaen et al., 2011]. However, this may well repre-
sent an underestimate of the true prevalence of mosaic NF1 deletions
because the parents of apparently sporadic patients with deletions
are generally not systematically analyzed in terms of whether they
exhibit mosaicism for the NF1 deletion detected in their offspring.

This problem may not be relevant in the case of the most frequent
type of NF1 deletion (type-1), which appears to be only rarely
associated with mosaicism; an estimated 2–4% of all patients with
de novo type-1 NF1 deletions are mosaic deletions [Messiaen et al.,
2011]. By contrast, type-2 deletions frequently arise during postzy-
gotic cell division giving rise to somatic mosaicism with normal cells
coexisting alongside those harboring the deletion [Kehrer-Sawatzki
et al., 2004; Petek et al., 2003; Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann et al.,
2007]. At least 44% of all patients with type-2 NF1 deletions exhibit
somatic mosaicism [Messiaen et al., 2011]. However, in practice, the
proportion of patients with mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions may well
be considerably higher [Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2004]. In our previ-
ous studies, we observed that the proportions of cells harboring the
deletion in blood samples of patients with type-2 deletions are very
high, in most cases exceeding 90% [Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2004,
Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann et al., 2007]. Hence, FISH analysis is
necessary to detect mosaicism with normal cells in cases of type-2
NF1 deletions because low rates of normal cells are not detectable
either by array comparative genomic hybridization or PCR-based
mutation analysis techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent
probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA).

Here, we have investigated whether leukocyte subtypes and urine-
derived epithelial cells from patients with mosaic NF1 deletions
exhibit differences in the proportion of cells harboring the dele-
tion as compared with whole blood. Eleven patients with type-2
NF1 deletions were investigated alongside two patients with mosaic
NF1 deletions other than type-2, in order to determine whether
high proportions of cells harboring the deletion in blood might be
characteristic of the type-2 deletion. Additionally, we determined
the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern in female patients
with mosaic NF1 deletions in blood, buccal epithelium, or urine
in an attempt to ascertain the timing of deletion formation during
embryonic development.

Patients and Methods

Patients and Cell Lines

The proportion of cells harboring the deletion (del(+/–) cells)
was analyzed by FISH and microsatellite markers in 11 patients with
mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions. The precise locations of the deletion
breakpoints of 10 of these 11 patients were determined in our pre-
vious study [Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann et al., 2007], whereas the
breakpoints of the newly identiﬁed deletion of patient 2442 were
characterized in this study using previously described methods. The
nucleotide positions of the deletion breakpoints of all 11 patients
with type-2 NF1 deletions are listed in Supp. Table S1. Mosaicism
was also investigated in patients 3304 and 1860-M with NF1 dele-
tions other than type-2. The breakpoints of the atypical deletion in
patient 1860-M were previously identiﬁed [Steinmann et al., 2008]
whereas the extent of the atypical or type-1 NF1 deletion of pa-
tient 3304 has been characterized in this study using FISH (Supp.
Fig. S1) and breakpoint-spanning PCR employing the primers listed
in Supp. Table S2. The clinical phenotypes of all three patients newly
described in this study are given in Supp. Table S3.

We assessed the proportion of del(+/–) cells in all 13 patients har-
boring mosaic NF1 deletions. FISH analysis was performed on cells
from whole blood cultured for 72 hr in the presence of phytohemag-
glutinin and on whole blood cells that were directly prepared for
FISH analysis without prior culture. We also used FISH to investigate
various leukocyte subtypes isolated from whole blood, which were
positive for speciﬁc cell surface antigens (CD3+, CD19+, CD14+,
542

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 33, No. 3, 541–550, 2012

and CD15+), and urine-derived epithelial cells. In one of the 11 pa-
tients with mosaic type-2 deletions (patient 488), we also used FISH
to determine the proportions of del(+/–) cells in ﬁbroblast cultures
from skin overlying three different cutaneous neuroﬁbromas as well
as primary cells from these tumors.

In order to determine the error rate of the FISH procedure em-
ployed, blood samples of six patients with non-mosaic (germline)
NF1 deletions were investigated (listed in Supp. Table S4). Two of
these six patients had an inherited atypical deletion (patients 1860
and 1860-1) whereas four patients had sporadic NF1 deletions. The
deletion in patient 1860 spans 1.3 Mb and is atypical [Steinmann
et al., 2008; Supp. Fig. S2]. Patient 1860 inherited the deletion from
her mother (1860-M) who exhibits mosaicism for the deletion. Pa-
tient 1860 passed on the atypical NF1 deletion to her son, patient
1860-1 (Supp. Fig. S3).

The control group of non-mosaic NF1 deletion patients in-
cluded two with a type-1 deletion (patients 3175 and 3415), patient
2358 with a non-mosaic type-2 deletion and patient BUD with a
germline atypical NF1 deletion spanning 4.7 Mb as previously re-
ported [Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2003]. The error rate intrinsic to
the FISH procedure was assessed in blood and isolated leukocyte
subtypes of these patients as summarized in Supp. Table S4. Addi-
tionally, we investigated the intrinsic error rate of the FISH analysis
using EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from a patient
with a non-mosaic (germline) type-2 NF1 deletion (patient 2429),
previously characterized by Roehl et al. [2010], and two patients
with type-1 NF1 deletions (patients 1746 and 2490.1). Both these
patients had type-1 deletions with breakpoints located within the
paralogous recombination site 2 (PRS2) hotspot as determined by
breakpoint-spanning PCR [Mautner et al., 2010].

Separation of Leukocyte Subtypes from Whole Blood

◦

In order to isolate different leukocyte subtypes from whole blood
samples, we performed magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS,
Myltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For the separation
of each of the respective leukocyte subtype, 4-ml whole blood were
C with antibodies binding to speciﬁc cell
incubated for 15 min at 4
surface epitopes and conjugated to ferromagnetic beads. These an-
tibodies were used to isolate CD3-positive cells (T-lymphocytes, T-
helper cells, and cytotoxic T-cells), CD19+ B-lymphocytes, CD14+
monocytes, and CD15+ granulocytes, respectively. Subsequently,
cells were washed with separation buffer (autoMACS Running
Buffer). After centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature, the
isolated cells were resuspended in 3-ml separation buffer. Immuno-
magnetic cell separation was performed with the whole blood col-
umn kit. Finally, the bead-isolated cells were eluted in 5-ml elution
buffer and centrifuged again. Cytogenetic slides were prepared af-
ter incubation of the cells in hypotonic solution (0.4% KCl) and
ﬁxation with methanol and acetic acid (3+1).

The efﬁciency of the separation procedure was assessed initially
by the analysis of a blood sample from a healthy individual. In this
control experiment, leukocyte subtypes were isolated as described
above. Subsequently, the bead-isolated cells were incubated with
speciﬁc ﬂuorescence-labeled antibodies in order to determine the
number of cells positive for the respective epitope and hence the iso-
lation efﬁciency (which ranged from 97.7–99.0%; Supp. Table S5).

Skin Fibroblasts and Neuroﬁbroma-Derived Cells

Three cutaneous neuroﬁbromas were excised from different skin
areas (trunk, head, and neck) of patient 488 and immediately
transferred into Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with

10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.01% gentamicin. The skin over-
lying the three neuroﬁbromas was removed and cut into smaller
pieces, which were transferred into cell culture ﬂasks to establish
skin ﬁbroblast cultures and then grown in DMEM with 10% FCS.
After 51 days of cell culture, the ﬁbroblasts were detached from the
cell culture vessel surface by trypsin treatment, incubated in hypo-
tonic solution (0.4% KCl) for 30 min and transferred onto slides
after ﬁxation to perform FISH analysis.

Cells were isolated from neuroﬁbromas by cutting the tumors
into small pieces followed by digestion of these pieces in DMEM
with 10% FCS and collagenase type-1 (160U/ml, Biochrom, Berlin,
◦
C overnight. The following day, the tumor pieces
Germany) at 37
were completely dissolved using a pipette. After centrifugation, the
cells were incubated in hypotonic solution (0.4% KCl) for 30 min,
centrifuged again, and ﬁxed with a mixture of methanol and acetic
acid (3+1). Finally, the cells were transferred onto slides for FISH
analysis.

Fluorescence in Situ Hybridisation (FISH)

Slides were prepared for interphase FISH from uncultured whole
blood samples, blood samples cultured for 72 hr in presence of phy-
tohemagglutinin, bead-isolated leukocyte subtypes and epithelial
cells from urine samples. At least 100-ml urine was necessary to
obtain slides containing sufﬁcient numbers of epithelial cells. FISH
was also performed on cultured skin ﬁbroblasts and neuroﬁbroma-
derived primary cells from patient 488. Dual-color FISH was per-
formed with BAC RP11-142O6, which spans the proximal part of
the NF1 gene (Supp. Fig. S1), and the alpha-satellite enumeration
probe SE17/D17Z1 (Kreatech, Amsterdam, Netherlands), as previ-
ously described [Jenne et al., 2003]. The extent of the NF1 deletion in
patient 3304 has not been previously reported and was determined
in this study by FISH using BAC and PAC clones (whose relative
genomic location is schematically indicated in Supp. Fig. S1).

Since FISH is inherently error prone and highly dependent upon
both the quality of the FISH probe and the slides used for the
analysis, we took great care to optimize hybridization quality and
only analyzed those FISH slides with fewer than 5% of nuclei that
were difﬁcult to evaluate in terms of the number of signals. Thus,
FISH slides with >5% of cells that were difﬁcult to evaluate were
excluded from the analysis. All slides were investigated by two per-
sons who performed their analyses independently from one another.
The ﬁnal results represented the average of these two independent
evaluations.

Estimation of the Error Rate of the FISH Technique

The number of del(+/–) cells has been found to be very high
in blood samples of patients with mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions, as
determined by FISH. To estimate the intrinsic error rate of the FISH
analysis, in particular the rate of falsely detected normal cells with
two signals pertaining to the NF1 probe RP11-146O2, we performed
FISH on whole blood cells, bead-selected leukocyte subtypes, and
urine-derived cells from patients with non-mosaic NF1 deletions
(Supp. Tables S4, S6, and S7). For this purpose, we also investigated
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from two patients with type-
1 NF1 deletions and one patient with a non-mosaic type-2 NF1
deletion (Supp. Table S8).

Breakpoint-Spanning PCRs

The patients with type-1 NF1 deletions, who were included in this
study as controls in order to determine the error rate of the FISH pro-
cedure, were analyzed by breakpoint-spanning PCRs. These PCRs

were designed to detect breakpoints located in the meiotic NAHR
hotspots PRS1 and PRS2 as well as in the breakpoint region 160P1-
F/ MD1-R identiﬁed by Forbes et al. [2004] in a single patient with
a type-1 NF1 deletion (Supp. Table S2).

Microsatellite Marker Analysis

DNA was extracted from blood and urine samples using the
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and from
buccal swabs with the NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel,
D¨uren, Germany). Primers used for the analysis of microsatellite
markers located within the NF1 microdeletion region are listed in
Supp. Table S9.

Statistical Analysis of the Proportion of del(+/−) Cells in
Pair-Wise Comparisons of Leukocyte Subtypes

In order to investigate whether the proportion of del(+/–) cells was
signiﬁcantly higher in CD14+ cells than in other leukocyte subtypes
or as detected in whole blood, we performed pair-wise comparisons
of the proportions of del(+/–) cells in each of the 11 patients with
mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions. These comparisons were performed
between the proportion of del(+/–) cells in CD14+ cells and the
proportions detected in CD3+, CD15+, CD19+ cells or whole blood,
respectively. The statistical signiﬁcance of the observed differences
was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

(cid:5)

labelled with 6-FAM and ARP4 5

To investigate XCI, we analyzed the polymorphic CAG repeat in
exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene located at Xq12 by means
of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) methylation-based
assay as described by Allen et al. [1992]. DNA methylation of this
region within the AR gene is highly correlated with X-inactivation
status [Allen et al., 1992]. In brief, heterozygosity for the repeat
(cid:5)
-TCC AGA ATC
was determined by PCR with primers ARP3 5
(cid:5)
-CTC ATC
TGT TCC AGA GC-3
(cid:5)
. The PCR products were separated and
CAG GAC CAG GTA GC-3
analyzed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosys-
tems, Carlsbad, CA). Nine of the 11 female patients with mosaic
NF1 deletions investigated were found to be heterozygous for the
CAG repeat within the AR gene and hence were informative. The
methylation-based PCR test was performed by restriction digestion
of 1-μg genomic DNA with the methylation-sensitive restriction en-
zyme HpaII for 2 hr. Complete restriction of the genomic DNA was
investigated by control experiments using plasmid DNA (pUC18).
For this purpose, 100-ng plasmid DNA was added to an aliquot of the
restriction assay with genomic DNA of the respective patient. After a
2-hr incubation, the plasmid control restriction assay was analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis; the distinctive bands of the plasmid
DNA were held to denote complete restriction. Subsequently, PCR
was performed, with the abovementioned primers being used to
amplify the AR repeat, using the HpaII-restricted genomic DNA of
the given patient as a template. The resulting PCR products were
separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic
Analyzer. The AR alleles were analyzed using Genescan and the area
under the curve (AUC) of each allele was measured with the Geno-
typer software in order to calculate the ratio of the active/inactive
X chromosome (XCI ratio). The HUMARA assays were performed
two to four times for each patient or tissue. Finally, the mean AUC
value for each allele was determined in order to assess the propor-
tion of cells harboring the higher molecular weight allele A2 on the
active X chromosome as described by Swierczek et al. [2008] and

Results

Error Rate of the FISH Analysis

FISH is quite adequate to the task of analyzing mosaicism in pa-
tients with large NF1 deletions because single cells can be analyzed.
However, FISH is inherently error prone and hence false-positive
signals may occur. For example, low rates of normal cells may be
difﬁcult to assess with any degree of precision owing to incorrectly
identiﬁed “normal” cells with two signals from the NF1 FISH probe.
To assess the error rate inherent to the FISH assay as performed here
(i.e., the rate of false-positive normal cells), we analyzed whole blood
samples and isolated leukocyte subtypes of six patients with non-
mosaic (germline) NF1 deletions (who would naturally be expected
to harbor the deletion in 100% of their cells). The investigated
non-mosaic NF1 deletions were of three types: atypical, type-1, and
type-2. The error rate of false-positive normal cells was on average
0.2% and never exceeded 0.8% (Supp. Tables S4 and S6). A low error
rate of false-positive normal cells (0.2–0.3%) was also detected by
FISH of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from three patients
with non-mosaic NF1 deletions (Supp. Table S8). We conclude that
the error rate of the FISH procedure as performed in this study is
low and has not confounded our analysis.

these data, the median difference was determined.

FISH Analysis of Leukocyte Subtypes from Patients with
Mosaic NF1Deletions

In blood samples of patients with mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions,
we have previously detected very high proportions (>91%) of cells
harboring the deletion (del(+/–) cells) [Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2004;
Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann et al., 2007] (Supp. Table S10). In
the present study, we investigated whether differences might exist
in terms of the proportion of del(+/–) cells in leukocyte subtypes
(CD3+, CD19+, CD14+, and CD15+) from the 11 patients with mo-
saic type-2 NF1 deletions. FISH analysis did not, however, reveal any
speciﬁc leukocyte subtype that showed a consistently higher propor-
tion of normal cells as compared with whole blood (Table 1; Supp.
Table S11). Remarkably, the proportions of del(+/–) cells detected
in CD14+ monocytes were signiﬁcantly higher than in CD3+ cells,
CD19+ lymphocytes, or in whole blood samples (Table 2). However,
the difference between the proportions of del(+/–) cells observed in
CD14+ monocytes and CD15+ granulocytes was not signiﬁcant (P =
0.096; Table 2, Supp. Table S11).

We also investigated whether the proportion of del(+/–) cells dif-
fered between blood samples taken from the same patient at dif-
ferent time points. We compared the proportions of del(+/–) cells

in cultured blood from the nine type-2 deletion patients analyzed
here with the proportions determined by us several years ago using
the same methodology [Roehl et al., 2010; Steinmann et al., 2007].
In seven of the nine patients, the proportions of del(+/–) cells de-
termined at two different time points were very similar, with the
differences between the proportions not exceeding 3%. In two out
of nine patients, however, the blood samples taken at these different
times exhibited differences in the proportions of del(+/–) cells of 6%
and 8%, respectively (Supp. Table S10).

In the present study, we also investigated mosaicism in the leuko-
cyte subtypes of two patients with atypical or type-1 NF1 dele-
tions (patients 3304 and 1860-M). The extent of the deletion in
patient 3304 was investigated by FISH and breakpoint-spanning
PCRs. These PCR assays were designed to detect breakpoints lo-
cated in the NAHR hotspots PRS1 and PRS2 that contain the break-
points of 89% of all type-1 NF1 deletions [De Raedt et al., 2006].
Further, we investigated whether patient 3304 was positive for the
deletion breakpoint-spanning PCR that detected the breakpoint in
patient UWA-160 corresponding to a type-1 deletion, as described
by Forbes et al. [2004]. Patient 3304 was, however, negative for these
breakpoint-spanning PCRs, and hence the presence of a type-1 NF1
deletion with breakpoints in these regions could be excluded. FISH
analysis of patient 3304 indicated that his deletion did not exceed
1.4 Mb in size and was either atypical or type-1 but had breakpoints
lying outside of the known hotspot regions PRS1 and PRS2 (Supp.
Fig. S1). Patient 1860-M has an atypical 1.3 Mb NF1 deletion as
demonstrated in our previous study [Steinmann et al., 2008] (Supp.
Fig. S2). FISH analysis indicated that the number of cells harbor-
ing the atypical NF1 deletion was very high in uncultured whole
blood of patient 1860-M (96%, Table 1). By contrast, patient 3304
exhibited much lower levels of del(+/–) cells in uncultured blood
(17%). In both patients, the proportion of del(+/–) cells in different
leukocyte subtypes was similar to the proportions detected in whole
blood samples (Table 1).

FISH and Microsatellite Marker Analysis of Urine-Derived
Epithelial Cells from Patients with Mosaic NF1Deletions

Mosaicism with normal cells is difﬁcult to assess with any degree
of certainty when the number of del(+/–) cells in blood exceeds 98%.
Therefore, we sought an additional tissue or cell type that could be
tested in order to improve the analysis of somatic mosaicism in pa-
tients with high proportions of blood del(+/–) cells. In our previous
analysis [Steinmann et al., 2007], we performed FISH on buccal
epithelial cells. However, the slide quality was often poor and hence
the FISH results proved difﬁcult to evaluate. In this study, we as-
sessed whether epithelial cells from urine samples of patients with
mosaic NF1 deletions might be more appropriate for the analysis
of mosaicism by FISH. Using urine samples, the error rate of the
FISH analysis regarding the number of false-positive normal cells
was low, on average 0.2% (Supp. Table S7). Intriguingly, the pro-
portions of del(+/–) cells were considerably lower in urine samples
(23.9–81.9%) from patients with mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions as
compared with uncultured blood (93.8–99%, Table 1). Similarly, in
patient 1,860-M with a mosaic atypical NF1 deletion detected in
96% of uncultured whole blood cells, a relatively low proportion of
del(+/–) cells was observed in urine (51%, Table 1). We therefore
conclude that uroepithelial cells are most appropriate as a means
to assess mosaicism with normal cells in patients with high num-
bers of del(+/–) cells in blood. The vast majority of cells from the
urine samples that we analyzed by FISH were squamous epithe-

the blood of patient 2442, only one allele of markers D17S2237 and

However, heterozygosity of these markers was clearly observed in both
urine and buccal epithelium, since the proportion of normal cells was
much higher in these tissues. G–L: In the blood of patient 697, only small

lial cells with polygonal appearance as determined by microscopic
inspection.

Microsatellite marker analysis of DNA from urine-derived epithe-
lial cells also proved to be very useful in detecting mosaicism with
normal cells (Fig. 1, Supp. Table S12). For example, in patient 2442,
the deletion was detected in 99.3% of the uncultured blood cells and
consequently, only one allele derived from markers located within
the type-2 deletion interval was observed in blood-derived DNA
(Fig. 1A and D). However, in urine and buccal epithelium, marker
heterozygosity was detected owing to the higher number of normal
cells found in these tissues (Fig. 1B–F). Comparative microsatellite
marker analysis was also helpful in interpreting small marker peaks
detected in blood. For example, a second small marker peak was
noted in blood from patient 697, possibly indicative of marker het-
erozygosity (Fig. 1G and J). Such small peaks are, however, difﬁcult

to interpret since “stutter” peaks are a common problem inher-
ent to the analysis of dinucleotide repeat markers. However, the
comparison of the height of the marker alleles observed in urine
and buccal epithelium with those in the blood of patient 697 clearly
identiﬁed the second allele, unequivocally indicating marker het-
erozygosity due to the higher proportion of normal cells in urine
and buccal epithelium (Fig. 1H–L).

Taken together, microsatellite marker analysis of urine DNA sam-
ples from 11 patients with mosaic type-2 NF1 deletions detected
marker heterozygosity and hence mosaicism with normal cells, in
all of them (Supp. Figs. S4–S12; Supp. Table S12). Thus, microsatel-
lite marker analysis using DNA derived from urine samples could
in principle replace FISH as a means to assess mosaicism with nor-
mal cells in patients with type-2 deletions or any other large NF1
deletion with high proportions of del(+/–) cells detected in blood.

FISH Analysis of Skin Fibroblasts and
Neuroﬁbroma-Derived Cells

In patient 488, 99% of the blood cells exhibited the type-2 deletion
(Table 1). Much lower proportions of del(+/–) cells were detected not
only in urine but also in ﬁbroblast cultures from skin samples over-
lying neuroﬁbromas (39–50%; Table 3). In neuroﬁbroma derived
cells, however, the proportion of del(+/–) cells was on average 83%
and thus higher than in skin ﬁbroblasts that exhibited an average
proportion of del(+/–) cells of 46%.

Proportions of Cells with Mosaic Type-2 Deletions in Blood
as Compared to Mosaic Atypical or Type-1 NF1Deletions

Six patients with generalized (non segmental) NF1 and mosaic
atypical or type-1 NF1 deletions have been previously reported, and
the proportion of del(+/–) cells in blood of these patients has been
investigated by FISH [Maertens et al., 2007; Messiaen et al., 2011;
Streubel et al., 1999; Tinschert et al., 2000; Tonsgard et al., 1997;
Wu et al., 1997] (listed in Supp. Table S13). Including patients 3304
and 1860-M analyzed here, the proportions of del(+/–) cells are now
known for a total of eight patients with mosaic non-type-2 NF1
deletions. Remarkably, only two of these eight patients exhibited
proportions of del(+/–) cells in blood of >90%. By contrast, all
11 patients with type-2 NF1 deletions investigated in this study had
proportions of del(+/–) cells in blood of >90% (Table 1). Hence, high
proportions of del(+/–) cells (>90%) are signiﬁcantly more frequent
in patients with type-2 deletions than in patients with other types of
mosaic NF1 deletions (P = 0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). Even
if the two patients reported by Tonsgard et al. [1997] and Wu et al.
[1997], who have not been well characterized with respect to the
extent of the respective mosaic deletion, were to be excluded from
the analysis, this difference would remain statistically signiﬁcant (P =
0.006, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test).

X-Inactivation in Patients with Mosaic NF1Deletions

The XCI pattern in nine female patients with mosaic NF1 dele-
tions was investigated by means of the HUMARA methylation assay.
Eight of these nine patients had type-2 deletions whereas one pa-
tient (1860-M) had an atypical NF1 deletion. In seven of these
nine females, skewed XCI (≥75% of the predominant allele) was
observed in blood. In six of these seven patients with mosaic NF1
deletions and skewed XCI in blood, we observed random XCI in
buccal epithelium or urine (Table 4; Supp. Table S14). In patient
938, skewed XCI was noted not only in blood but also in buccal
epithelium and urine, suggesting that primary skewing may affect
all tissues in this patient. In the blood of patient 1502, we observed
an XCI ratio of 28:72, which just fell short of meeting the diagnostic
criterion for skewed XCI. By convention, skewing is considered only
if ≥75% of the cells inactivate the same X chromosome. In patient
488, who possesses a mosaic type-2 deletion, the XCI pattern was
clearly random in blood (54:46). Random XCI was also observed

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed mosaicism in 11 patients with type-2
NF1 deletions and two patients with atypical or type-1 deletions.
High proportions (94–99%) of cells harboring the deletion [del(+/–)
cells] were evident in the blood of all 11 patients with type-2 dele-
tions (Table 1). Nine of these 11 patients had already been inves-
tigated several years ago at which time high rates of del(+/–) cells
had been evident in blood (Supp. Table S10). Hence, the proportion
of del(+/–) cells appears to be consistently high over time in the
blood of patients with type-2 NF1 deletions. In contrast to blood,
much lower proportions of del(+/–) cells (24–82%) were evident in
urine from the 11 patients with type-2 deletions. However, these
tissue-speciﬁc differences in the proportion of del(+/–) cells were
not found to be exclusive to patients with type-2 deletions. Patient
1860-M, who possessed an atypical large NF1 deletion, also exhib-
ited a much higher proportion of cells with the deletion in blood
(96%) than in urine (51%; Table 1). We conclude that type-2 NF1
deletions (and rarely also other types of NF1 deletion) arise at an
early stage during embryonic development and that hematopoietic
primordial stem cells harboring these deletions may have a selec-
tive growth advantage over normal stem cells lacking the deletion.
The type-2 deletions investigated in this study, as well as the atyp-
ical deletion of patient 1860-M, must have occurred during the
blastocyst stage or even earlier, certainly before embryonic day 12
and the onset of gastrulation because del(+/–) cells were detected
in derivatives of all three germ cell layers, the endoderm (epithe-
lial cells from the urinary system), mesoderm (blood cells), and
ectoderm (skin ﬁbroblasts, neuroﬁbroma-derived cells, and buccal
epithelium) (Supp. Table S15).

Further conclusions about the timing of the deletion event in
female patients with mosaic NF1 deletions may be drawn from
the XCI pattern. XCI is initiated in preimplantation blastocysts
[Okamoto et al., 2011; van den Berg et al., 2009, 2011]. Subsequently,
chromosome-wide XCI gradually becomes fully established during
implantation and the postimplantation blastocyst stage [Migeon,
2007; Okamoto et al., 2011]. It has been estimated that 8–16 pro-
genitors of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are present at the
time of XCI [Amos-Landgraf et al., 2006; Fialkow, 1973; Prchal et al.,
1996; Puck et al., 1992]. During primary XCI, the choice of the X
chromosome to be inactivated occurs mostly at random. However,
signiﬁcant deviations from the theoretical 50:50 XCI ratio of the
two parental X chromosomal alleles have been detected in healthy
females. Such a “skewed” XCI pattern is considered if ≥75% of the
cells inactivate the same parental X chromosome [Bolduc et al.,
2008; Busque et al., 2006]. The incidence of skewing in healthy
females is known to vary with age and between different tissues
[Amos-Landgraf et al., 2006; Bolduc et al., 2008; Busque et al., 2006;
Sandovici et al., 2004; Sharp et al., 2000]. Approximately 28% of
healthy females <43 years exhibit skewed XCI in blood [Bolduc
et al., 2008]. However, the incidence of skewing increases to 40%
in the blood of healthy women >60 years [Busque et al., 2006].
When we consider only those seven of the nine investigated females
with mosaic NF1 deletions who were younger than 43 years, three
of these seven patients were found to exhibit moderately skewed
XCI (≥75% and ≤91% of the predominant allele) in blood but not
in epithelial tissues, whereas two patients exhibited random XCI
in blood (Table 4). In one patient (UC172) extremely skewed XCI
was observed in blood (≥91% of the predominant allele) but not in

buccal epithelial cells. We conclude that in this patient, the deletion
may have occurred after XCI as schematically depicted in Figure 2A.
By contrast, the XCI patterns observed in the other patients with
mosaic NF1 deletions imply that the respective deletions occurred
before the onset of XCI.

In contrast to patients with type-2 NF1 deletions and patient
1860-M with an atypical deletion, patient 3304 (who possesses a
mosaic type-l or atypical NF1 deletion) was found to exhibit a low
rate of the deletion in both blood (17%) and urine (25%; Table 1).
Although the rates of the deletion were low, the fact that cells of both
mesodermal and endodermal origin harbored the deletion indicate
an early occurrence of the deletion during embryonic development
in this patient as well. Since patient 3304 had numerous cutaneous
neuroﬁbromas (Supp. Table S3), ectodermal cells are also affected
by the deletion. We conclude that also the deletion in patient 3304
should have preceded gastrulation. However, his deletion probably
occurred later than the deletions in the other mosaic patients in-
vestigated here because of the low proportions of the del(+/–) cells.
The lack of a growth advantage of hematopoietic del(+/–) stem cells
in this patient may be related to the relatively late occurrence of the
deletion.

Taken together, our ﬁndings imply that mosaic NF1 deletions,
which are present in a high proportion of peripheral blood cells of
affected NF1 patients, arise early during embryonic development.
The majority of them is likely to have occurred in the preimplanta-
tion blastocyst stage or even earlier, before the onset of XCI. A selec-
tive advantage of hematopoietic del(+/–) stem cells present during a
speciﬁc window of embryonic development could then account for
the observed tissue-speciﬁc differences in the proportions of cells
harboring the deletions. NF1 is known to act as a tumor suppressor
gene in hematopoietic progenitor cells and loss of NF1 heterozy-
gosity is a cause of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML)
[Side et al., 1997; Steinemann et al., 2010]. One of the hallmark
features of JMML is the hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells
to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
in colony forming assays [Emanuel et al., 1991]. The NF1 gene
product, neuroﬁbromin, acts as a negative regulator of Ras and hy-
peractive Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling
is known to be causally involved in the pathogenesis of JMML and
other myeloid cancers [reviewed by Loh, 2011]. Children (but not
adults) with NF1 are at a >200-fold increased risk of JMML [Bader
and Miller, 1978]. Intriguingly, the risk of JMML in patients with
NF1 appears to be conﬁned to a narrow developmental window.
Those children with NF1 who do not develop JMML during their
ﬁrst few years are not at any increased risk of developing hemato-
logic malignancies later in life. Thus, neuroﬁbromin is an essential
Ras GTPase-activating protein in hematopoietic stem cells that are
hypersensitive towards NF1 loss during a speciﬁc time window of
development.

Adoptive transfer of Nf1–/- liver cells into irradiated wild-type
recipient mice results in a myeloproliferative disease [Bollag et al.,
1996; Largaespada et al., 1996]. Moreover, Nf1-deﬁcient myeloid
and lymphoid stem cells are known to exhibit a growth advantage
in competitive repopulation studies of irradiated recipient mice
[Zhang et al., 2001]. Taken together, these observations have sug-
gested a key role for neuroﬁbromin not only in myeloid cells but
also in lymphocyte development and function. Biallelic NF1 in-
activation has been observed in a small subset of children with
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphoblas-
tic leukemia (T-ALL) [Balgobind et al., 2008]. Furthermore, so-
matic NF1 deletions with a minimal deleted region of 0.9 Mb have
been identiﬁed in 11% of adults with AML [Parkin et al., 2010].
These ﬁndings imply that loss of neuroﬁbromin is an important

Figure 2. Model to explain the consequences of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) preceding the deletion event (or vice versa) as well as the
consequences of a selective growth advantage of hematopoietic stem cells harboring the deletion (del(+/−) cells) over normal cells in patients
with mosaic NF1deletions. A: If XCI precedes the deletion event (indicated by a dark gray color of the cells), all del(+/−) cells will have the same
X chromosomal ARallele inactivated. The onset of XCI, which occurs randomly, is indicated by X1 or X2. Owing to the selective advantage of
primordial hematopoietic del(+/−) stem cells over normal cells, extremely skewed XCI (≥91% of the predominant allele) is observed in blood. In
buccal epithelium, del(+/−) cells exhibit no growth advantage over normal cells and hence, much lower proportions of del(+/−) cells are detected
as well as random XCI. This model may explain the extremely skewed X inactivation observed in blood of patient UC172. B: If the deletion precedes
XCI, random or mildly skewed XCI (≥75% but ≤91% of the predominant allele) is observed in blood of patients with large NF1deletions. Owing to
the selective advantage of primordial hematopoietic del(+/−) stem cells over normal cells, high rates of del(+/−) cells are observed in blood of the
patients. According to this model, the deletions occurred during the preimplantation blastocyst stage or even earlier when both X chromosomes
(X1 and X2) were active. Owing to the selective advantage of primordial hematopoietic del(+/−) stem cells over normal cells, high rates of del(+/−)
cells are observed in blood of the patients resulting in random or skewed XCI. By contrast, epithelial del(+/−) stem cells do not exhibit selective
growth over normal cells. Hence, random XCI is noted in urine or buccal epithelial cells. This model may explain the XCI pattern as well as the
rates of del(+/−) cells observed in patients 697, 1630, 736, 2442, 1860, 488, and 1502.

mechanism in hematologic malignancies other
than JMML
[Balgobind et al., 2008; Parkin et al. 2010]. Nevertheless, an in-
creased risk to NF1 patients of hematologic malignancies other than
JMML, either with intragenic mutations or large NF1 deletions, has
not so far been reported.

In mice, the homozygous inactivation of Nf1, and even the loss
of a single Nf1 allele, is sufﬁcient to modulate Ras activity in un-
stimulated T-cells, and this correlates with a substantial increase in
T-cell subset numbers [Ingram et al., 2002]. Alongside the various
other lines of evidence outlined above, these data indicate that neu-

roﬁbromin is an important growth regulator of hematopoietic stem
cells in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments. We surmise
that NF1 haploinsufﬁciency consequent to a large NF1 deletion in
susceptible primordial hematopoietic stem cells confers a growth
advantage upon del(+/–) stem cells over normal stem cells lacking
the deletion. Our ﬁndings in NF1 patients harboring mosaic NF1
deletions suggest that this growth advantage results in high propor-
tions of del(+/–) cells in peripheral blood. Importantly, we observed
high levels of the deletions in all leukocyte subtypes investigated (Ta-
ble 1). Since the proportions of cells containing the deletion were

high in all leukocyte subtypes analyzed, the separation of leuko-
cyte subtypes and subsequent FISH analysis failed to improve the
detection of low rates of normal cells as frequently observed in pa-
tients with mosaic type-2 deletions. Our present study has however
indicated that FISH analysis of urine-derived epithelial cells or mi-
crosatellite marker analysis in urine-derived or buccal epithelial cells
represents excellent methods to detect mosaicism in patients with
large NF1 deletions.
