Visual–spatial problems are among the most common cognitive
deﬁcits detected in individuals affected with NF1 (refs 1, 8). Studies
have shown that Nf1+/- mice have abnormal spatial learning2 when
tested in the hidden version of the water maze—a task that is
sensitive to hippocampal lesions9. Studies suggest that an upregula-
tion of Ras activity may account for the learning deﬁcits in NF1 both
in mice10 and humans11. To test this hypothesis, we crossed the
Nf1+/- mice (C57B6/N background) with mice heterozygous for a
null mutation in the K-ras gene12 (K-ras+/-, 129T2/SvEmsJ), and
tested the F1 descendants (hybrid isogenic background) in the
hidden version of the water maze task. Because K-ras-/- mice, like
Nf1-/- (ref. 13), die in utero12, we used K-ras+/- mice, which are
viable and show no apparent developmental defects.

..............................................................................................................................................
Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common
single-gene disorders that causes learning deﬁcits in humans1.
Mice carrying a heterozygous null mutation of the Nf1 gene
(Nf1+/-) show important features of the learning deﬁcits asso-
ciated with NF1 (ref. 2). Although neuroﬁbromin has several
known properties and functions, including Ras GTPase-activating
protein activity3,4, adenylyl cyclase modulation5,6 and microtubule
binding7, it is unclear which of these are essential for learning
in mice and humans. Here we show that the learning deﬁcits of
Nf1+/- mice can be rescued by genetic and pharmacological
manipulations that decrease Ras function. We also show that the
Nf1+/- mice have increased GABA (g-amino butyric acid)-mediated
inhibition and speciﬁc deﬁcits in long-term potentiation, both of
which can be reversed by decreasing Ras function. Our results
indicate that the learning deﬁcits associated with NF1 may be
caused by excessive Ras activity, which leads to impairments in
long-term potentiation caused by increased GABA-mediated
inhibition. Our ﬁndings have implications for the development
of treatments for learning deﬁcits associated with NF1.

Mice were trained with two trials per day. In all the following
experiments, no differences between genotypes and/or treatments
were observed in acquisition (Fig. 1a, d, g), ﬂoating, thigmotaxic
behaviour or swimming speed (data not shown). Spatial learning
was assessed in a probe trial14 (training day 7), in which the platform
was removed from the pool. The time spent searching in the training
quadrant was different among the different genotypes (analysis of
variance, ANOVA, F3,61 = 7.27, P , 0.05). Wild-type mice spent
signiﬁcantly more time searching in the training quadrant than did
Nf1+/- mice (Fisher’s protected least signiﬁcant difference, PLSD,
P , 0.05; Fig. 1b), conﬁrming that the Nf1+/- mice have impaired
spatial learning. K-ras+/- mice were also impaired (P , 0.05; Fig. 1b);
however, mice carrying heterozygous mutations in both the Nf1 and
the K-ras genes (Nf1+/-/K-ras+/-) spent as much time as wild-type
mice in the training quadrant (P . 0.05; Fig. 1b), and signiﬁcantly
more time than Nf1+/- and K-ras+/- mice (P , 0.05). This indicates
that the learning deﬁcits in Nf1+/- mice can be rescued by the K-ras+/-
mutation. Furthermore, both wild-type (paired t-test, t23 = 5.935,
P , 0.05) and Nf1+/-/K-ras+/- mice searched selectively for the
missing platform; that is, they searched closer to the exact platform
position than to the opposite position in the pool15 (t10 = 4.09, P ,
0.05; Fig. 1c), whereas Nf1+/- and K-ras+/- mice did not (Nf1+/- t14 =
1.83; K-ras+/- t14 = 0.149; P . 0.05).

Mutations that decrease Ras function do rescue the deﬁcits of
the Nf1+/- mice because a null heterozygous mutation in N-ras
(N-ras+/-), another mammalian ras gene with overlapping function
and similar expression to that of K-ras12, also reverses the spatial
learning deﬁcits of the Nf1+/- mice (Fig. 1e, f; see Methods). During
the probe trial, there was a signiﬁcant effect of genotype on
searching strategy (F3,32 = 2.83, P , 0.05; Fig. 1e). Nf1+/-/N-ras+/-
mice were indistinguishable from wild type (Fisher’s PLSD,
P . 0.05), and searched signiﬁcantly more in the training quadrant
than did Nf1+/- mice (P , 0.05). Also, analysis of proximity scores
showed that both wild-type and Nf1+/-/N-ras+/- mice searched
selectively (wild type,
t8 = 5.84;
P , 0.05; Fig. 1f), whereas Nf1+/- mice did not (t14 = 1.83, P . 0.05).
The N-ras+/- mutation by itself did not produce any detectable
phenotype (P . 0.05; Fig. 1e), consistent with previous studies
indicating that Ras signalling is less impaired in N-ras than in K-
ras mutants12.

t9 = 3.621; Nf1+/-/N-ras+/-,

The ras mutations that reversed the Nf1+/- spatial learning deﬁcits
should result in a decrease in Ras function throughout the life of the
mice. To determine whether decreases in Ras function speciﬁcally
during training could reverse the learning deﬁcits of the Nf1+/- mice,
we used a farnesyl-transferase inhibitor (FTI; BMS 191563; ref. 16).
This agent reduces Ras signalling by blocking farnesylation, a post-
translational modiﬁcation that is essential for Ras function17. FTIs
have been shown to rescue other NF1 phenotypes, such as Schwann
cell proliferation in human and murine cells18,19. Wild-type and
Nf1+/- mice were injected intraperitoneally every day 60 min before
training with either saline or 5 mg per kg (body weight) BMS
191563; the training conditions and the genetic background of the
animals were the same as in the Nf1+/-/K-ras+/- experiment.

Analysis of the day 7 probe trial showed an effect of genotype–

treatment interaction on searching strategy (F3,32 = 2.83, P , 0.05;
Fig. 1h). Nf1+/- mice treated with BMS191563 searched signiﬁ-
cantly longer in the training quadrant than Nf1+/- mice treated
with saline (P , 0.05), and were indistinguishable from wild-
type mice
(P . 0.05). Moreover, analysis of proximity scores
showed that Nf1+/- mice treated with BMS191563 searched selec-
tively (t18 = 4.13, P , 0.05; Fig. 1i), as did wild-type mice (t17 = 4.33,
P , 0.05), whereas Nf1+/- mice treated with saline did not (t19 =
0.266, P . 0.05). Administration of 5 mg per kg BMS191563 did not
adversely affect wild-type animals, as these mice searched equiva-
lently to wild-type mice treated with saline (P . 0.05; Fig. 1h).
The ﬁnding that the learning deﬁcits of Nf1+/- mice can be reversed
with an FTI conﬁrms our genetic results, and shows that these
learning deﬁcits are reversible in adult mice.

Learning is thought to occur through activity-dependent synap-
tic modiﬁcations in neuronal networks20. To determine whether
changes in synaptic plasticity might account for the spatial (hippo-
campal-dependent9) learning impairments of Nf1+/- mutants, we
examined long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral/CA1
synapses in hippocampal slices from these mice. Schaffer collateral
stimulation (60 mA) elicited a similar baseline excitatory post-
synaptic potential (EPSP) in Nf1+/- and wild-type mice (Nf1+/- =
1.02 6 0.06 mV, wild type = 1.09 6 0.05, F1,54 = 0.58, P . 0.05).

We ﬁrst induced LTP using a theta-burst stimulation (TBS)
protocol, which mimics the in vivo activity of hippocampal neurons

during exploratory behaviour21. This protocol consisted of two, ﬁve
or ten bursts. The two-burst protocol elicited a persistent potentia-
tion in wild-type animals (Fig. 2a), which was signiﬁcantly larger
than that triggered in Nf1+/- mice (F1,11 = 6.98, P , 0.05). This
difference was also seen with ﬁve (F1,13 = 8.27, P , 0.05; Fig. 2b) and
ten bursts (F1,16 = 6.93, P , 0.05; Fig. 2c). Thus, TBS stimulation
shows that there is an LTP deﬁcit in Nf1+/- mice (Fig. 2e). We also
examined LTP induced under high-frequency stimulation (HFS,
100 Hz for 1 s; Fig. 2e). With this protocol, the potentiation induced
was equivalent in wild-type and Nf1+/- mice (F1,15 = 0.06, P . 0.05;
see below).

To determine whether the TBS-induced LTP deﬁcits in Nf1+/-
mice were caused by increased Ras function, we tested Nf1+/-/
K-ras+/- mice (of the same genetic background as those tested in
the water maze). The magnitude of CA1 LTP induced with a two-
burst protocol differed across genotypes (F3,35 = 4.6, P , 0.05;
Fig. 2d). The amount of LTP induced in Nf1+/-/Kras+/- was sig-
niﬁcantly higher than that induced in Nf1+/- mice (Fisher PLSD,
P , 0.05), and equivalent to that of wild-type mice (P . 0.05;
Fig. 2f). K-ras+/- mice were also signiﬁcantly impaired relative to
both Nf1+/-/Kras+/- and wild-type mice (LTP at 40 min 114 6 4.47,
P , 0.05; data not shown). These results show that the K-ras+/-
mutation can rescue the LTP deﬁcits in Nf1+/- mice, just as it can
also rescue their spatial learning deﬁcits.

Nf1+/- mice also showed a decrease in the input–output function

of extracellularly recorded EPSPs at the Schaffer collateral/CA1
synapse (F1,16 = 4.11, P , 0.05, Fisher PLSD (100 mA), P , 0.05;
Fig. 3a). Neither this impairment, nor the LTP deﬁcit, seemed to be
caused by abnormal presynaptic function, because electrophysio-
logical phenomena sensitive to presynaptic changes such as paired-
pulse facilitation (F1,19 = 0.43, P . 0.05; Fig. 3b), augmentation,
depletion and probability of glutamate release22 were normal in
Nf1+/- mice (data not shown). The LTP deﬁcits of Nf1+/- mice were
revealed by TBS, but not HFS stimulation. LTP induced by TBS is
more sensitive to changes in GABA-mediated inhibition than is LTP
induced by HFS23. In addition, Ras can affect chloride currents in
adrenal gland cells24. We therefore investigated whether GABA-
mediated inhibition was altered in Nf1+/- mice. We measured
evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in CA1 pyrami-
dal cells of hippocampal slices from Nf1+/- mice. We found that
Nf1+/- mice have larger IPSPs than those of wild-type controls
(ANOVA, F1,88 = 5.31, P , 0.05; Fisher PLSD, P , 0.05; Fig. 3c). We
also measured monosynaptically evoked IPSPs in the presence of
AP5 (2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid), an NMDA (N-methyl-
D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroqui-
noxaline-2,3-dione), an AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
isoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptor antagonist (Fig. 3d). Once
IPSPs were larger in Nf1+/- than in wild-type mice
again,
(ANOVA, F2,237 = 5.09, P , 0.05; Fisher PLSD, P , 0.05; Fig. 3d).
The increased inhibition in Nf1+/- mice was also rescued by
manipulations that decrease Ras function: IPSPs in Nf1+/-/K-ras+/-

mice are smaller than in Nf1+/- mice (P , 0.05; Fig. 3d) and
indistinguishable from wild-type controls (P . 0.05).

Results from several of our experiments suggest that this increase
in GABA-mediated inhibition is the cause for the LTP deﬁcits in
Nf1+/- mice. First, picrotoxin (10 mM), a GABAA receptor antago-
nist, rescues the LTP (two-burst) deﬁcits of Nf1+/- mice (F1,9 = 0.78,
P . 0.05; Fig. 4a). Second, LTP deﬁcits are evident in Nf1+/- mice
(Fig. 2a) at synaptic stimulation strengths (60 mA) that cause an
increase in GABA-mediated inhibition, but are absent at synaptic
stimulation strengths (35 mA) that do not cause increases in
inhibition (F1,27 = 0.263, P . 0.05; Figs 3c and 4b). Note that in
wild-type mice the LTP induced at a stimulation strength of 60 mA is
larger than that induced at 35 mA (F1,16 = 18.1, P , 0.05), whereas in
Nf1+/- mice it is not (F1,22 = 0.18, P . 0.05; Fig. 4c). This is
consistent with the larger inhibition in Nf1+/- mice at 60 mA
(Fig. 4c). Third, LTP induced with HFS, which is less sensitive to
inhibition than LTP induced with TBS, is normal in Nf1+/- mice
(Fig. 2e).

Our results show that the spatial learning impairments in a
mouse model of NF1 can be rescued by two different genetic
manipulations that decrease Ras levels. Our data also show that
the learning deﬁcits in Nf1+/- mice can be reversed pharmacologi-
cally in the adult—an important ﬁnding for the development of
treatments for learning deﬁcits associated with NF1. Our results
suggest that abnormally high or low Ras activity can disrupt
learning, indicating that precise Ras modulation by neuroﬁbromin
is essential for learning and memory. Although the learning deﬁcits
in Drosophila that lack neuroﬁbromin are dependent on adenylyl
cyclase6, Nf1+/- mice have normal adenylyl cyclase activity25. These
mice, however, have upregulated Ras/mitogen-activated protein
kinase activity26. Our data indicate that increased Ras activity,

caused by partial loss of neuroﬁbromin, leads to abnormally high
GABA-mediated inhibition, and that this enhancement in inhibi-
tion may be responsible for impairments in synaptic plasticity that
might underlie the learning deﬁcits associated with NF1. These
ﬁndings suggest that strategies that decrease either Ras activity or
GABA-mediated inhibition might be used to treat the learning
deﬁcits associated with NF1.

Methods
Animals
Generation of the different genetically modiﬁed mice has been described12,27,28. For the
Nf1+/-/N-ras+/- experiment, we generated animals by crossing Nf1+/- mice, which had been
previously backcrossed ﬁve generations to the C57BL/6N background from 129T2/
SvEmsJ (N5 into C57BL/6N), with N-ras+/- also backcrossed ﬁve generations to the
C57BL/6N background. All the other animals were 129T2/SvEmsJ–C57BL/6N F1 hybrids
generated by crossing Nf1+/- mice (backcrossed more than 11 generations to the C57BL/
6N background) with wild-type or K-ras+/- mice on the 129T2/SvEmsJ background. Thus,
in every experiment the mice from each genotype were littermates and of isogenic genetic
background. All experiments were carried out blind with respect to genotype or treatment.

Water maze
The basic protocol for the water maze experiments has been described10. Mice from the
129T2/SvEmsJ–C57B/6N F1 background were given two trials per day (30-s intertrial
intervals) with a probe trial (60 s) at the end of training day 7. Because mice from the
C57B/6N genetic background take longer to learn the water maze29, mice from the Nf1+/-/
N-ras+/- population (N5 into C57BL/6N) were given three blocks of two trials per day,
with a probe trial at training day 5. We used contextual fear conditioning in wild-type mice
(129T2/SvEmsJ–C57BL/6N F1) to determine the dose used in the BMS191563 experi-
ments. With one single injection 6 h before training, a dose of 10 mg per kg (body mass)
did not affect learning but higher dosages did (time freezing: saline, 63.3%; 10 mg per
kg, 55.8%; 30 mg per kg, 34.4%; 45 mg per kg, 46.7%). But 10 mg per kg injected for 7 days
(as in the water maze experiment) affected learning in wild-type mice (saline, 82.9%; 10
mg per kg, 52.2%; F1,10 = 9.43, P , 0.05). As shown, 5 mg per kg injected for 7 days did not
affect learning in wild-type mice. We dissolved BMS191563 in sterile saline solution and
injected it every day 1 h before the experiment started.

Electrophysiology
For the ﬁeld potentials, recordings were made from transverse hippocampal slices
(400 mm thick) in a submerged recording chamber perfused (2 ml min-1) with artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 Mg2SO4,
1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 D-glucose at 30 8C (saturated with 95% O2 and 5%
CO2). For the LTP experiments, EPSPs were evoked alternatively in separate pathways
(control and tetanized) in the CA1 Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents with 100-ms
test pulses through two stimulating electrodes (,300 mm from the Pt/Ir recording

letters to nature

electrode). Unless indicated otherwise, the stimulation strength in both stimulating
electrodes was set to 60 mA. After a 10-min baseline period, LTP was induced in one
pathway according to a HFS (100 Hz for 1 s) or TBS protocol (two, ﬁve or ten bursts, each
burst four pulses at 100 Hz, 200-ms interburst intervals). We excluded from further
analysis slices in which there was signiﬁcant drift in the control pathway or in which
seizures developed. The amount of potentiation was calculated as a percentage of the
baseline EPSP slope. For the experiments with picrotoxin, the drug was dissolved (10 mM)
in ACSF and was present throughout the experiment. For the input–output curves, we
applied different stimulation strengths (from 10 to 100 mA in steps of 10 mA). For each
slice, ﬁve EPSPs were averaged per stimulation strength. Paired-pulse facilitation was
assessed by measuring the per cent increase in the slope of the second pulse in relation to
the ﬁrst (20-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 300-, 400-, 500-ms interpulse intervals). The stimulation
strength was adjusted to one-third of the maximum EPSP amplitude.

To assess inhibition in Nf1+/- mice, we measured IPSPs from CA1 pyramidal neurons

using whole-cell (blind technique30) bridge mode recordings (Axoclamp 2B, Axon
Instruments). IPSPs were evoked through a stimulating electrode placed in the Schaffer
collateral/commissural afferents (,75 mm from the recording pipette when AP5 and
CNQX were applied) that applied different stimulation strengths (from 10 to 100 mA in
steps of 10 mA). The IPSP amplitude was measured, with ﬁve IPSPs averaged for each
neuron per stimulation strength. The intracellular solution contained (in mM): 135
potassium gluconate, 5 HEPES, 2 Mg2+-ATP, 5 MgCl2, 0.3 GTP, 0.05 EGTA (pipette
resistance 7–11 MQ). To evoke IPSPs monosynaptically, AP5 and CNQX (10 mM) were
present in the ACSF.

In all experiments, data were averaged and entered into analysis as a single subject, and

therefore reﬂect individual mice rather than individual slices or neurons.

Statistical analysis
We analysed acquisition data from the water maze by repeated-measures ANOVA. Per cent
time in training quadrant for the different genotypes was analysed using single-factor
ANOVA; post-hoc comparisons (Fisher’s PLSD) between genotypes were carried out when
appropriate. Planned comparisons using a paired t-test were used to analyse the proximity
data. LTP was analysed using single-factor ANOVA on the average amount of LTP 30–
40 min after induction. We analysed the inhibition and input–output curves using
ANOVA, and post-hoc comparisons were performed when appropriate.

Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have
markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The
strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node
status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast
tumours according to their clinical behaviour1–3. Chemotherapy
or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by
approximately one-third; however, 70–80% of patients receiving
this treatment would have survived without it4,5. None of the
signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6–12
allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA
microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young
patients, and applied supervised classiﬁcation to identify a gene
expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to
distant metastases (‘poor prognosis’ signature) in patients with-
out tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node
negative). In addition, we established a signature that identiﬁes
tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature con-
sists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and

angiogenesis. This gene expression proﬁle will outperform all
currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome.
Our ﬁndings provide a strategy to select patients who would
beneﬁt from adjuvant therapy.

We selected 98 primary breast cancers: 34 from patients who
developed distant metastases within 5 years, 44 from patients who
continued to be disease-free after a period of at least 5 years, 18 from
patients with BRCA1 germline mutations, and 2 from BRCA2
carriers. All ‘sporadic’ patients were lymph node negative, and
under 55 years of age at diagnosis. From each patient, 5 mg total
RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tumour material and used to
derive complementary RNA (cRNA). A reference cRNA pool was
made by pooling equal amounts of cRNA from each of the sporadic
carcinomas. Two hybridizations were carried out for each tumour
using a ﬂuorescent dye reversal technique on microarrays contain-
ing approximately 25,000 human genes synthesized by inkjet
technology13. Fluorescence intensities of scanned images were
quantiﬁed, normalized and corrected to yield the transcript abun-
dance of a gene as an intensity ratio with respect to that of the signal
of the reference pool14. Some 5,000 genes were signiﬁcantly regu-
lated across the group of samples (that is, at least a twofold
difference and a P-value of less than 0.01 in more than ﬁve
tumours).

An unsupervised, hierarchical clustering algorithm allowed us to
cluster the 98 tumours on the basis of their similarities measured
over these approximately 5,000 signiﬁcant genes. Similarly, the
,5,000 genes were clustered on the basis of their similarities
measured over the group of 98 tumours (Fig. 1a). In the dendro-
grams shown in Fig. 1a (left and top), the length and the subdivision
of the branches displays the relatedness of the breast tumours (left)
and the expression of the genes (top). Two distinct groups of
tumours are the dominant feature in this two-dimensional display
(top and bottom of plot, representing 62 and 36 tumours, respec-
tively), suggesting that the tumours can be divided into two types on
the basis of this set of ,5,000 signiﬁcant genes. Notably, in the
upper group only 34% of the sporadic patients were from the group
who developed distant metastases within 5 years, whereas in the
lower group 70% of the sporadic patients had progressive disease
(Fig. 1b). Thus, using unsupervised clustering we can already, to
some extent, distinguish between ‘good prognosis’ and ‘poor prog-
nosis’ tumours.

To gain insight into the genes of the dominant expression
signatures, we associated them with histopathological data; for
example, oestrogen receptor (ER)-a expression as determined by
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (Fig. 1b). Out of 39 IHC-
stained tumours negative for ER-a expression (ER negative), 34
clustered together in the bottom branch of the tumour dendrogram.
In the enlargement shown in Fig. 1c, a group of downregulated
genes is represented containing both the ER-a gene (ESR1) and
genes that are apparently co-regulated with ER, some of which are
known ER target genes. A second dominant gene cluster is asso-
ciated with lymphocytic inﬁltrate and includes several genes
expressed primarily by B and T cells (Fig. 1d).

Sixteen out of eighteen tumours of BRCA1 carriers are found in
the bottom branch intermingled with sporadic tumours. This is
consistent with the idea that most BRCA1 mutant tumours are ER
negative and manifest a higher amount of lymphocytic inﬁltrate15.
The two tumours of BRCA2 carriers are part of the upper cluster of
tumours and do not show similarity with BRCA1 tumours. Neither
high histological grade nor angioinvasion is a speciﬁc feature of
either of the clusters (Fig. 1b). We conclude that unsupervised
clustering detects two subgroups of breast cancers, which differ in
ER status and lymphocytic inﬁltration. A similar conclusion has
also been reported previously7,16.

The 78 sporadic lymph-node-negative patients were selected
speciﬁcally to search for a prognostic signature in their gene
expression proﬁles. Forty-four patients remained free of disease
