Abstract

Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity of spinal anomalies in neurofibroma-
tosis type 1 (NF1), the pathogenesis of these defects remains largely unknown. Here, we
present two murine models: Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;Col.2.3Cre mice, which recapitu-
late spinal deformities seen in the human disease. Dynamic histomorphometry and microto-
mographic studies show recalcitrant bone remodeling and distorted bone microarchitecture
within the vertebral spine of Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice, with analogous
histological features present in a human patient with dystrophic scoliosis. Intriguingly, 36–
60% of Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice exhibit segmental vertebral fusion
anomalies with boney obliteration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). While analogous findings
have not yet been reported in the NF1 patient population, we herein present two case re-
ports of IVD defects and interarticular vertebral fusion in patients with NF1. Collectively,
these data provide novel insights regarding the pathophysiology of dystrophic spinal anom-
alies in NF1, and provide impetus for future radiographic analyses of larger patient cohorts
to determine whether IVD and vertebral fusion defects may have been previously over-
looked or underreported in the NF1 patient population.

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder, affecting
greater than two million individuals worldwide [1, 2]. Neurofibromin, the protein product of
the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, functions as a guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein for
Ras [3]. When mutated, haploinsufficient and/or nullizygous loss of NF1 leads to hyperactiva-
tion of Ras signaling pathways, resulting in a wide range of malignant and nonmalignant

Dystrophic Spinal Deformities in a NF1 Murine Model

clinical manifestations [4]. Skeletal abnormalities are frequently observed in the setting of NF1
and can include osteoporosis [5–10], increased fracture risk [11, 12], short stature [13–15],
macrocephaly [14], bowing and pseudarthrosis of the long bones [16–20], chest wall deformi-
ties [20], sphenoid wing dysplasia [19, 21], and spinal deformities [22–24]. Spinal deformities
in NF1 may be relatively common, with one case series reporting up to 77% of study subjects
being affected [25–27].

Scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity observed in NF1 and approximately 2% of
all pediatric scoliosis cases are associated with NF1 [23]. Scoliosis in NF1 can be further sub-
classified as either non-dystrophic or dystrophic, based on the presence of various radiographic
findings [22]. Non-dystrophic scoliosis in NF1 mimics idiopathic scoliosis in the general popu-
lation, but typically presents earlier. By contrast, dystrophic scoliosis involves dysplastic osse-
ous changes with rapid onset and progression. Characteristic radiographic features of
dystrophic scoliosis include short-segment sharply angulated curves involving four to six verte-
brae, vertebral rotation, vertebral wedging, scalloping of the vertebral margins, spindling of the
transverse processes, pedicle defects, rib penciling, and widening of the spinal canal [22, 24].
Dystrophic scoliosis can lead to debilitating sequelae including neurological impairment due to
impingement of the spinal cord. There is a risk of pseudarthrosis, or non-union, following or-
thopedic instrumentation of the affected vertebrae in individuals with NF1 [28–30].

Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity associated with scoliosis and other
spinal anomalies in individuals with NF1, their pathophysiology remains largely unknown.
Since NF1 dystrophic scoliosis has been observed in close proximity to paraspinal plexiform
neurofibromas [31, 32], it has been postulated that physical or paracrine interactions between
the vertebral column and the adjacent tumor may be required to induce the pathogenesis and/
or progression of dystrophic spinal deficits [33]. However, given that Nf1 plays a pivotal role in
regulating the function of multiple bone cell types including osteoclasts [34–37], mesenchymal
stem cells [38], osteochondroprogenitors [39], and osteoblasts [40], the possibility that such
dystrophic defects may arise de novo from intrinsically dysregulated bone remodeling merits
further investigation.

To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying dystrophic scolio-
sis in NF1, it is possible to develop animal models which accurately recapitulate the characteris-
tic features seen in the human disease. Recently, our laboratory reported the generation of two
new NF1 murine models: Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice, which harbor Nf1 nullizygous mesenchymal
stem cells on a systemic Nf1+/− background, and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice, which harbor condi-
tional Nf1 nullizygous osteoblasts on a systemic Nf1+/− background. These mice exhibit a spec-
trum of osseous defects including low bone mass, induced tibial fracture non-union, and
runting (short stature) [41]. Cortical and trabecular bone mass was also significantly reduced
in lumbar vertebrae of Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice as compared to wild-type (WT) littermates
[41]. Here, we extend our investigation of osseous phenotypes in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;
Col2.3Cre mice to characterize dystrophic spinal deformities, which in part recapitulate those
seen in the human disease.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Nf1+/− mice were obtained from Dr. Tyler Jacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(Cambridge, MA) [42]. Nf1flox/flox mice were provided by Dr. Luis Parada at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center [43]. PeriCre transgenic mice were provided by Dr. Simon
J. Conway at Indiana University [44], whereby Cre expression in adult MSCs is achieved under
control of the 3.9kb fragment of the periostin promoter [41]. Col2.3Cre transgenic mice were

generated as described elsewhere [45], whereby Cre expression in terminally differentiated os-
teoblasts is driven by the 2.3kb fragment of α1(I) collagen promoter. Nf1flox/−;PeriCre (harbor-
ing conditional Nf1−/− MSCs on a Nf1+/− background) and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice (harboring
conditional Nf1−/− osteoblasts on a Nf1+/− background) were generated by genetic intercross of
Nf1+/−, Nf1flox/flox, PeriCre, and Col2.3Cre mice as described previously [41]. Nf1flox/flox (WT),
Nf1flox/− (Nf1+/−), and Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice were used as control. All animal
studies were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee (#10376). Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation with cervical dislocation subsequently
performed as a secondary means of ensuring death.

Radiography

Mouse radiographs. Mice were anesthetized in a chamber containing an effective concen-
tration of 1.5% isoflurane delivered in oxygen using a precision vaporizer. Whole spine anteri-
or-posterior and lateral radiographs were acquired using a Digital Specimen Radiography
(DSR) System with Biopix Software (Version No: 1.0.6., Bioptics, Inc. Tucson, AZ). Thoracic
kyphosis was quantitatively assessed in lateral radiographs by applying the Cobb technique to
measure the kyphotic angle between lines drawn parallel to the superior seventh thoracic (Th7)
and the inferior fourth lumbar (L4) vertebral endplates [46]. In a similar fashion, Cobb angle
measurement was also performed in anterior-posterior radiographs to objectively identify sco-
liosis and determine the severity of lateral curvature in the spine. Scoliosis was defined accord-
ing to the classical definition of a Cobb angle greater than or equal to 10 degrees [47]. Vertebral
wedging was defined quantitatively by the angle formed by the intersection of lines drawn par-
allel to the rostral and caudal vertebral end-plates as described by Funasaki and colleagues [48].

Patient radiographs. Radiographs of individuals with NF1 with features of dystrophic

scoliosis were obtained from the University of Utah NF Center (Salt Lake City, UT) and Johns
Hopkins Comprehensive NF Center (Baltimore, MD). Human subject research was performed
in accordance with approval from the Indiana University IRB (#1011003777), the University of
Utah IRB (#00011143), and the Johns Hopkins University IRB (#NA_00016949). Patient ra-
diographs were analyzed anonymously. Nonetheless, verbal and written informed consent was
obtained prior to publication of medical images.

Micro-computed tomography (μCT)

Murine samples. Bone volume and microarchitecture of dystrophic vertebrae from

Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice were evaluated using a high-resolution desktop micro-computed to-
mography imaging system (μCT-20; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Corre-
sponding vertebral segments in WT mice were evaluated as a control. Specimens were scanned
with a slice increment of 9 μm. μCT images were reconstructed, filtered (σ = 0.8 and support =
1.0), and thresholded (22% of maximum possible gray scale value). Trabecular bone was out-
lined, excluding the cortical and subcortical bone. Every 10 sections were contoured manually,
and the intermediate sections were interpolated with the contouring algorithm to create a vol-
ume of interest. Microarchitecture parameters were computed including bone volume fraction
(BV/TV, %), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm−1), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), and trabecu-
lar spacing (Tb.Sp, μm).

Human samples. The T5 facet of an individual with NF1 with dystrophic scoliosis and the
T7 facet of an individual with scoliosis without NF1 were scanned in the gantry of a VivaCT 40
micro-computed tomographer (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Images were
acquired at a voxel size of 10.5 μm. Images were acquired at a voxel size of 10.5 μm. The voxel
of interest (VOI) comprised the whole bone excluding the cortical margins. Parameters of

bone microarchitecture including BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, and connectivity density
(Conn.D., mm−3) were calculated. Human subject research was performed in accordance with
approval from the Indiana University IRB (#1011003777) and the University of Utah IRB
(#00011143). Data from human bone specimens were analyzed anonymously. Nonetheless,
verbal and written informed consent was obtained prior to publication of these data.

Histology

Murine samples. Mice with dystrophic vertebral defects were sacrificed at various time-
points including 1, 2, 6, 9, and 12-months of age. The dystrophic vertebral segments were dis-
sected with corresponding segments harvested from age matched WT mice as the control. 4-
μm-thick sections were cut in the sagittal plane, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Slides were examined at 100x magnification on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diag-
nostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI).

Human samples. The T5 facet of an individual with NF1 with dystrophic scoliosis and the

T7 facet of an individual with scoliosis without NF1 were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours,
decalcified in 10% EDTA for 2 weeks, and cut to 3.5 μm thick longitudinal sections using a ro-
tary microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar Germany). Sections were stained for H&E and
imaged using a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped
with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Human sub-
ject research was performed in accordance with approval from the Indiana University IRB
(#1011003777) and the University of Utah IRB (#00011143). Data from human bone speci-
mens were analyzed anonymously. Nonetheless, verbal and written informed consent was ob-
tained prior to publication of these data.

Dynamic histomorphometry
Fluorochrome labeling of the bones was performed in 4 week-old mice by intraperitoneal injec-
tions of calcein (20 mg/kg, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) and alizarin red (20 mg/kg,
Sigma) 8 and 3 days prior to euthanasia. Following euthanasia, L5 vertebrae were fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and embedded undecal-
cified in methylmethacrylate. Mid-sagittal sections (4 μm thick) were cut from the vertebrae.
Sections were examined at 200x magnification on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Microsys-
tems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic In-
struments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). The region of interest was established by a boundary
beginning 0.5 mm proximal to the midpoint of the growth plate, non-inclusive of cortical
bone, and extending proximally for a total area of approximately 2.8 mm2. Trabecular bone
turnover was assessed by measuring the extent of single label (sL.Pm), double label (dL.Pm)
and the area of bone (dL.Ar) between the calcein and alizarin labels using Image Pro Plus ver-
sion 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Derived histomorphometric param-
eters included mineralizing surface (MS/BS, %), a measure of active bone-forming surface,
calculated as follows: the [1/2 sL.Pm + dL.Pm]/Tt.Pm
100; mineral apposition rate (MAR,
μm/day), a measure of the rate of radial expansion of new bone, calculated as follows: dL.Ar/
dL.Pm/4 dy; and bone formation rate (BFR), an overall measure of bone formation that com-
bines MS/BS and MAR, calculated as follows: MS/BS

Statistical analysis
Differences between experimental groups were determined by the Student’s t-test or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests where
appropriate. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Animal Data

Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre transgenic mice recapitulate hallmark clinical features
of NF1 dystrophic kyphoscoliosis. Scoliosis is defined clinically as an abnormal lateral cur-
vature of the spine with a Cobb angle greater than or equal to 10 degrees [47]. Applying this
clinical criterion to the NF1 murine model, a series of radiographs acquired from WT, Nf1+/−,
Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;PeriCre transgenic mice were examined in a blinded fashion
and screened for the presence of scoliosis using the Cobb method [47]. We observed no evi-
dence of scoliotic deformities in WT or Nf1+/− mice; however, 3/43 (*7%) Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre
and 15/41 (*37%) Nf1flox/−;PeriCre animals exhibited radiographic evidence of scoliosis
(Table 1). Moreover, the mean Cobb angle in Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre mice with scoliotic deformities
was approximately 11 degrees, versus 16 degrees in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice, with three out of 15
animals exhibiting curvatures of greater than 20 degrees. Consistent with these findings,
Nf1flox/flox;Col2.3Cre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice exhibit a similar phenotype, with an inci-
dence of scoliotic deformities of *55% in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice as compared to *20% in
Nf1flox/flox;Col2.3Cre animals. Collectively, the increase penetrance of scoliotic deformities in
Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice suggests that Nf1 heterozygosity in at least of sub-
set of cell lineages together with biallelic Nf1 inactivation in MSCs/osteoblasts play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of scoliosis in theses NF1 murine models.

Characteristic radiographic features of NF1 dystrophic scoliosis include short-segment

curves involving four to six vertebrae, vertebral rotation, vertebral wedging, scalloping of the
vertebral margins, spindling of the transverse processes, pedicle defects, rib penciling, and wid-
ening of the spinal canal [22, 24]. Here we provide radiographic evidence demonstrating the
presence of several of these hallmark dystrophic features in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice with corre-
lates with the human disease. Representative radiographs illustrate short-segment, sharply
angulated curves of the thoracic and lumbar spine in two individuals with a clinical diagnosis
of NF1 (Fig. 1A). In comparison, we observed similar short-segment curves in the thoracic and
lumbar spine of Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice (Fig. 1B). Significant vertebral rotation, another

hallmark dystrophic feature, is also apparent in this representative radiograph of a Nf1flox/−;
Col2.3Cre mouse with thoracic kyphoscoliosis (Fig. 1B, second panel).

We additionally documented the presence of vertebral wedging in three of 20 Nf1flox/−;

Col2.3Cre mice (Fig. 1C), with a mean wedging angle of 31.32 ± 7.15 (SD) degrees. Vertebral
wedging was also observed in three of 41 Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and one of 45 Nf1flox/−;PeriCre ani-
mals, with a mean wedging angle of 32.55 ± 4.72 (SD) degrees in the Nf1flox/−;PeriCre cohort.
This phenotype was not apparent in the other control genotypes including Nf1flox/flox;Col2.3Cre
(n = 15), Nf1+/− (n = 26), and WT (n = 29) mice. Other dystrophic characteristics including
spindling of the transverse processes, pedicle defects, and rib penciling were not radiographi-
cally apparent in either the Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre or PeriCre mouse models.

Kyphosis presents as an exaggerated rounding of the spine resulting in a “hunchback” defor-

mity. When we examined lateral radiographs acquired from Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice, marked
thoracic kyphosis was apparent as compared to the other control strains (Fig. 2A). To further
quantify the severity of kyphotic deformity in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice, the kyphotic angle from
T7-L4 was measured using an adapted Cobb method for mice [46]. A statistically significant in-
crease (P < 0.001) in the mean thoracic angle was observed in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice as com-
pared to WT, Nf1+/−, and Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice (Fig. 2B). By contrast, eight out of 41
experimental animals in the Nf1flox/−;PeriCre group exhibited kyphotic angles of greater than
90 degrees in lateral radiographs, with a maximum of curvature of approximately 127 degrees
in one experimental animal. Consistent with these findings, Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre animals exhibit
a similar phenotype (data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that Nf1flox/−;PeriCre
and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mouse models recapitulate several of the characteristic osseous features
of NF1 associated dystrophic kyphoscoliosis as seen in NF1 patients.

Bone mass, microarchitecture, and remodeling are pathologically altered in Nf1flox/−;

Col2.3Cre mice with dystrophic spinal deformities. To further investigate whether dystro-
phic spinal deformities in the NF1 murine model may be associated with the pathological alter-
ations in bone mass and trabecular microarchitecture, μCT scans were performed on
dystrophic vertebrae harvested from Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice. Bone microarchitecture parame-
ters including bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %) and trabecular number (Tb.N, mm−1),
(Fig. 3A-B) were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in dystrophic Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre vertebrae as
compared to the corresponding segments from age-matched WT animals controls. Consistent
with these findings, trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp, μm) was found to be significantly greater in
Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre vertebrae versus controls (Fig. 3C). Similar phenotypes were observed in
Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice (data not shown) Collectively, these data demonstrate an association be-
tween dystrophic spinal deformities in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice and path-
ological bone mass and microarchitecture deficits within the dystrophic vertebral segments.

Given that bone mass and microarchitecture were significantly impaired in dystrophic ver-

tebrae from Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice, we next sought to ascertain whether these deficits may
further be associated with deregulated bone remodeling in the Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre murine
model. To monitor bone formation in vivo, two fluorochromes, calcein (20 mg/kg) and alizarin
red (20 mg/kg), were administered by intraperitoneal injection 8 and 3 days prior to euthana-
sia, respectively. Representative photomicrographs illustrate a markedly reduced incorporation
of the calcein and alizarin labels within the trabecular bone surface of L5 vertebrae excised
from Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre as compared to WT mice (Fig. 4A). Statistically significant reductions
in the active bone-forming surface, or mineralizing surface (MS/BS, %) (Fig. 4B, P < 0.05), and
the mineral apposition rate (MAR) (Fig. 4C, P < 0.01), a measure of the rate of radial expan-
sion of new bone were observed in the Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre L5 vertebrae versus controls. More-
over, the bone formation rate (BFR), an overall measure of bone formation that combines MS/

IVD defects and vertebral fusion in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice. Unexpectedly,

radiographic analysis revealed progressive destruction of the intervertebral disc (IVD) space
and fusion of adjacent vertebral segments within focal regions of the axial spine in Nf1flox/−;Peri-
Cre and Col2.3Cre transgenic mice. This phenotype was evident in *8.7% (4/46) of Nf1flox/flox;
PeriCre animals and *36.6% (15/41) of Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice, but absent in WT and Nf1+/−
(Table 2). Consistent with these data, Nf1flox/flox;Col2.3Cre and Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice exhibit a
similar phenotype, with an increased frequency of vertebral fusion in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice as
compared to Nf1flox/flox;Col2.3Cre animals.

Representative sagittal and parasagittal μCT reconstructions further demonstrate vertebral
asymmetry and ossification of the IVD space with cancellous bone in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice
(Fig. 5A, ii and iv). Histological sections acquired from mice one, two, six, and 12 months of
age illustrate the phenotype in varying stages of progression in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice (Fig. 5).
Atrophy of the AF was evident in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice beginning from one month of age
(Fig. 5B, i-ii). Between two to six months of age, there is evidence of significant degeneration of
both the AF and NP with intervertebral fusion beginning from the lateral margins of the disc in
Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice as compared to WT control mice (Fig. 5B, iii-vi). Finally, by 12 months
of age, complete obliteration of the physiologic IVD architecture is evident in Nf1flox/−;
Col2.3Cre mice, and the IVD space has been replaced with infiltrating cancellous bone and
marrow cells, resulting in interarticular fusion of the adjacent segments (Fig. 5B, vii-viii).

Human Subjects Data

Bone mass and microarchitecture defects in an NF1 patient presenting with dystrophic
scoliosis. Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice exhibit pathological alterations in bone mass and micro-
architecture within the vertebral spine. To investigate whether analogous osseous deficits may
also be present in the human condition, we were able to obtain a T5 facet surgically excised
from a 10 year old girl with NF1 with dystrophic scoliosis. As a control, we examined the T7
facet from an 18 year old boy without NF1 with idiopathic scoliosis (without NF1) as a control.
Representative μCT reconstructions of the excised bone demonstrate markedly reduced bone
mass and disrupted trabecular architecture in the T5 facet from the individual with NF1 with
dystrophic scoliosis (Fig. 6C, D) as compared to the control sample (Fig. 6A, B). Bone volume
fraction (BV/TV), connectivity density (Conn.D., mm−3), trabecular number (mm−1), and tra-
becular thickness (Tb.Th, mm) were reduced in the NF1 T5 facet relative to the T7 control;
whereas trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp, mm), bone surface/bone volume ratio (BS/BV, mm−1), and
density anisotropy (DA) were increased in the NF1 T5 facet versus the control (Table 3). In
sum, these human data are consistent with the low bone mass phenotype and

Discussion
Up to 77 percent of NF1 patients may exhibit scoliosis according to some estimates [25–27].
Surprisingly, however, Nf1+/− mice exhibit neither spinal deformities nor any of the other char-
acteristic skeletal deficits seen in the human disease, suggesting that Nf1 nullizygosity in at least
a subset of cell lineages may be required for the genesis of some of these osseous manifestations.

Here we demonstrate that conditional biallelic Nf1 inactivation in mesenchymal stem cells
and/or osteoblasts together with a systemic Nf1 heterozygous genetic background is sufficient
to induce characteristic NF1 associated spinal deformities closely reminiscent of that seen in
the human disease, including dystrophic and non-dystrophic sharply angulated short-segment
curves involving the thoracic and lumbar spine, vertebral rotation, and vertebral wedging.
Unlike PeriCre, which drives Cre recombinase expression in both MSCs [41] as well as
Schwann cells [44], Col2.3Cre expression is restricted to mature osteoblasts [45]; and thus,
Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice do not develop neurofibromas. The genesis of dystrophic kyphoscolio-
sis in the Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre model, together with the associated findings of reduced fractional
bone volume, disrupted microarchitecture, and deregulated bone remodeling within the
Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre vertebral spine and the vertebral bone of a human NF1 patient with dystro-
phic scoliosis are further consistent with the concept that these osseous manifestations may in-
deed arise as a direct consequence of primary defects in bone cellular function, development,
or differentiation, rather than the mass effect of a paraspinal neurofibroma. Given the rarity of
obtaining such human bone specimens from the vertebral spine, further studies will be neces-
sary to ascertain whether primary alterations in bone remodeling and microarchitecture are in-
deed responsible for the observed clinical phenotypes.

The increased penetrance of scoliotic deformities and thoracic kyphosis in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre

and Col2.3Cre mice even as compared to Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre controls, further
suggests that cooperative interactions between Nf1 nullizygous MSCs/osteoblasts and at least a
subset of other Nf1 heterozygous lineages plays a role in the pathogenesis of these defects in the
NF1 murine model. In a series of adoptive bone marrow transfer experiments, we previously
established a pivotal role for Nf1 haploinsufficient hematopoietic cells in the pathogenesis of
tibial pseudarthrosis (fracture non-union) in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice [41]. It is
plausible that similar heterotypic cellular interactions may be operative in the genesis of dystro-
phic spinal deformities in the NF1 murine model, although additional experiments are neces-
sary to confirm this hypothesis. In particular, we postulate enhanced bone resorptive activity of
Nf1 haploinsufficient hematopoietic derived osteoclasts to be a likely culprit [34, 36, 37], as we
have observed a significant increase in osteoclast activity in the long bones [41] and vertebral
spines [41] of Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre and Nf1flox/−;PeriCre mice. By contrast, a number of previous

between the 8th and 12th thoracic vertebrae and a left thoracolumbar curve measuring 23 degree between

thoracic vertebrae.

studies have demonstrated that Nf1 nullizygous osteoblasts exhibit an impaired capacity to dif-
ferentiate and mineralize new bone matrix [38, 40]. Thus, enhanced osteolytic activity by Nf1+/−
osteoclasts, coupled with the inability of Nf1 deficient osteoblasts to mount an appropriate ana-
bolic response may account for the bone mass, microarchitecture, and remodeling deficits ob-
served in Nf1flox/−;Col2.3Cre mice.

Although Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice recapitulate many of the hallmark features of

dystrophic scoliosis seen in the human disease, we found that the degree of spinal curvature
was likely less pronounced in the NF1 murine model than that seen in individuals with NF1
and dystrophic scoliosis where the Cobb angle can reach 70 degrees or greater in severe cases
[49]. One potential explanation for this discrepancy may relate to the differing biomechanical
circumstances of humans and mice. The vertebrae in quadrupeds do not receive an axial load
to maintain balance of the torso, which is the major loading mechanism in bipeds [50]. Consis-
tent with this rationale, it has been demonstrated that scoliotic deformities can be induced with
100% penetrance in rats attaining bipedal posture after undergoing surgical amputation of the
tail and forelimbs [51]. It is thus plausible that differing mechanical circumstances between bi-
peds and quadrupeds may explain why Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice do not recapitulate
the full extent of lateral spinal curvature seen in NF1 patients with dystrophic scoliosis.

Intriguingly, between 36–60% of Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre mice also exhibit progres-
sive dysplastic deformation of the vertebral bodies, with destruction of the IVD and fusion of
adjacent vertebral segments evident by 6–12 months of age. Consistent with these findings, a
recent genetic study of mice harboring conditional Nf1 nullizygous osteochondroprogenitor
cells driven by the Col2α1-Cre (collagen, type II, alpha 1) promoter demonstrated congenital
IVD formation defects, with improper segmentation of the notochord and impaired prolifera-
tion of the nucleus pulposus (NP) accompanied by interarticular vertebral fusion [39]. The au-
thors further note that this phenotype was 100 percent penetrant, with deficits present
uniformly at every spinal level. In the present study, we utilized the 3.9kb fragment of the Peri-
ostin promoter and the 2.3kb segment of the α(I)-Collagen promoter to achieve a more re-
stricted biallelic ablation of Nf1 in mesenchymal stem cells and mature osteoblasts,
respectively. The reduced penetrance and severity of IVD and fusion defects in the PeriCre ani-
mal model as compared to the Col2a1Cre model published by Wang and colleagues is likely at-
tributable to the robustness of Cre mediated recombination within the MSC compartment,
whereby Cre expression in bone marrow derived MSCs cultured from PeriCre [41] and
Col2α1Cre [39] mice appears to be significantly more robust in the latter. Likewise, in contrast
to both the PeriCre and Col2a1Cre animal models, Col2.3Cre mediated recombination is fur-
ther restricted to mature osteoblasts alone [45]. Interestingly, in the present study, we observed
a significantly increased frequency of IVD and fusion defects in Nf1flox/−;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre
mice as compared to even Nf1flox/flox;PeriCre and Col2.3Cre controls, suggesting that Nf1 het-
erozygosity in surrounding tissues and cell lineages (in the context of Nf1 nullizygous MSCs
and osteoblasts) may play a role in the pathogenesis of these anomalies.

In contrast to the aforementioned murine models, vertebral fusion and IVD defects in the
NF1 patient population have rarely been documented in the medical literature. In 1986, Sar-
toris and colleagues documented one case of presumptive neuropathic arthropathy in a NF1
patient presenting with destruction of the L1-L2 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disk space

[52]. A retroperitoneal neurofibroma was identified anterior to the L1-L2 interspace; however,
no neurofibromatosis tissue was found within the disk space itself, leaving questions regarding
the underlying etiology. Here we present two cases of IVD defects/vertebral fusion in patients
with a clinical diagnosis of NF1. The first case involves a 24 year old woman with multiple
café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, dermal neurofibromas, and pectus carinatum present-
ing with congenital C6–7 vertebral fusion with an absent disc. The second individual was a 7
year old girl with NF1 and dystrophic scoliosis with segmentation and fusion anomalies at the
8th-10th thoracic vertebrae. The paucity of interarticular vertebral fusion and IVD defects re-
ported in the medical literature likely reflects inherent differences between murine models of
the disease versus the human condition. Whereas biallelic Cre-mediated Nf1 recombination
within osteoblasts and/or osteoprogenitor cells occurs homogenously in animal models, clini-
cally such losses of NF1 heterozygosity are likely to be relatively rare events, occurring only
within focal regions of the bone or sometimes not at all within any given patient. Nonetheless,
it is also possible that these deficits have been overlooked or underreported in NF1 patients.
Future retrospective radiographic analysis of larger patient cohorts may help clarify whether
this phenotype may have been previously overlooked or underreported in the NF1
patient population.
