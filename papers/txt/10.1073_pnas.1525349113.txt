Glioblastomas (GBMs) rapidly become refractory to anti-VEGF
therapies. We previously demonstrated that ectopic overexpres-
sion of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) compromises the benefits of anti-
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) treatment in murine GBM models and that
circulating Ang-2 levels in GBM patients rebound after an initial
decrease following cediranib (a pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase in-
hibitor) administration. Here we tested whether dual inhibition of
VEGFR/Ang-2 could improve survival in two orthotopic models of
GBM, Gl261 and U87. Dual therapy using cediranib and MEDI3617
(an anti–Ang-2–neutralizing antibody)
improved survival over
each therapy alone by delaying Gl261 growth and increasing
U87 necrosis, effectively reducing viable tumor burden. Consistent
with their vascular-modulating function, the dual therapies en-
hanced morphological normalization of vessels. Dual therapy also
led to changes in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Inhibi-
tion of TAM recruitment using an anti–colony-stimulating factor-1
antibody compromised the survival benefit of dual therapy. Thus,
dual inhibition of VEGFR/Ang-2 prolongs survival in preclinical
GBM models by reducing tumor burden, improving normalization,
and altering TAMs. This approach may represent a potential ther-
apeutic strategy to overcome the limitations of anti-VEGFR mono-
therapy in GBM patients by integrating the complementary effects
of anti-Ang2 treatment on vessels and immune cells.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive

primary malignant brain tumor in adults (1). Based on
promising phase II trials, bevacizumab (Avastin), a VEGF mono-
clonal antibody, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration
in 2009 as salvage monotherapy for recurrent GBM (rGBM) (1–5).
However, three randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab in com-
bination with chemoradiation in newly diagnosed GBM patients and
in combination with chemotherapy in rGBM patients failed to pro-
long overall survival despite the extension of progression-free survival
(6–8). A randomized trial of cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor
(VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with or without lomustine also
failed to show improved survival in patients with rGBM (9). In-
hibition of VEGFR2 transiently “normalized” GBM vasculature and
improved the outcome of radiotherapy in mice bearing GBM (10).
Vascular normalization also reduced intracranial edema, contributing
to the survival benefit in animal models (11). Similarly, treatment
with cediranib induced transient vessel normalization in patients with
rGBM, effectively reducing edema (12, 13). Unfortunately, resistance
to anti-VEGF therapy develops rapidly in patients with GBM.
Modulation of other angiogenic, growth, and survival programs in

Significance

Inhibition of the VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway has
failed to increase overall survival in phase III trials in patients
with glioblastoma (GBM). Previously we identified the angio-
poietin-2 (Ang-2)/TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie-2) pathway
as a potential driver of resistance to VEGF inhibition in GBM.
Here we show that dual inhibition of VEGFRs and Ang-2 inhibits
tumor growth and prolongs vessel normalization compared
with VEGFR inhibition alone, resulting in improved survival in
murine GBM models. Furthermore, by blocking macrophage re-
cruitment, we demonstrate that macrophages contribute to the
beneficial effects of dual therapy.

response to VEGF-signaling blockade may mediate this resistance (1,
14–16). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel combinations
targeting such resistance pathways to increase survival in GBM.

Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is often up-regulated in GBMs (17–19)
and is thought to play a role in GBM angiogenesis (17, 20, 21).
Ang-2 is a member of the angiopoietin family that signals pri-
marily through the tyrosine kinase receptor TEK receptor tyrosine
kinase (Tie-2). Ang-1 and Ang-2 play important, often comple-
mentary, roles in maintaining normal vasculature through the
modulation of vessel stability (22). Ang-2–mediated vessel de-
stabilization can be either pro- or antiangiogenic in a context-
dependent manner (17, 23–26). Increased Ang-2 expression may
be an escape mechanism to anti-VEGF therapy. In both clinical
and preclinical GBM studies, Ang-2 levels decline temporarily
following inhibition of the VEGF pathway but later rebound as
tumors become resistant to therapy (10, 12). We have shown that
ectopic expression of Ang-2 in a GBM animal model compro-
mised the survival benefit of VEGF-signaling inhibition by
impairing vessel normalization and edema control (27). Moreover,
tumor autopsy tissues from rGBM patients treated with anti-
VEGF therapy showed abnormally high levels of Ang-2 (28), and
the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio correlated positively with survival (29) and
vascular normalization (12). Therefore, we hypothesized that dual
inhibition of VEGF and Ang-2 signaling could prolong the win-
dow of normalization or normalize vessels to a greater extent and
thereby enhance the survival benefit of anti-VEGF therapy.

Additionally, we recently demonstrated that vascular normali-
zation leads to efficient immune cell recruitment and promotes an
immuno-stimulatory microenvironment in murine breast tumors
(30). Given that tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration
is an important determinant of tumor progression and response to
therapy in GBM and other tumors (31–33), we further hypothe-
sized that TAMs may play a role in the response to dual therapy.
In this study we combined an Ang-2–neutralizing monoclonal
antibody that targets both human and murine Ang-2, MEDI3617
(MedImmune) (34), with cediranib (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals)
and assessed the effects of dual therapy on survival, tumor growth,
vascular normalization, and TAM phenotype in two orthotopic
models of GBM in mice: Gl261 (a syngeneic, hypovascular murine
GBM model) and U87 (a highly angiogenic human GBM model).

Results
Dual Anti-VEGFR/Ang-2 Therapy Extends Survival Compared with
Cediranib Monotherapy. We treated mice bearing orthotopic
Gl261 or U87 tumors with control IgG, MEDI3617, cediranib, or
cediranib+MEDI3617 dual therapy. Consistent with our pre-
vious experience in GBM (10, 11, 27), treatment with cediranib
alone significantly increased survival of Gl261-bearing mice
compared with control (median 24 d vs. 20 d). MEDI3617
treatment also increased median survival (24 d). Strikingly, dual
therapy significantly prolonged survival compared with the
monotherapy and control arms (38 d) (Fig. 1A and Table S1).
Similarly, dual therapy significantly increased mouse survival in
U87-bearing mice (median 26 d) compared with mice treated
with cediranib alone (13 d), MEDI3617 alone (7 d), or control
treated mice (5 d) (Fig. 1E and Table S1).

Given the significant improvement in survival in mice treated
with dual therapy over cediranib monotherapy, we next examined
the impact of treatment on tumor growth. Gl261 tumors treated
with either cediranib or dual therapy grew significantly more
slowly than control tumors. Moreover, tumors treated with dual
therapy grew more slowly than cediranib-treated tumors (Fig. 1B).
This sustained delay in growth resulted in significantly smaller
tumors near the median survival time of cediranib-treated mice
(day 20) in the dual-therapy group compared with the cediranib
group as measured by MRI (Fig. 1C). We also examined the ex-
tent of necrosis and observed no significant difference between
Gl261 tumors treated with dual therapy or with cediranib

Fig. 1. Dual cediranib+MEDI3617 therapy enhances survival and reduces
tumor burden in Gl261 and U87 tumors compared with cediranib therapy
alone. Mice bearing Gl261 (A–D) or U87 (E–H) tumors were treated with
control (green traces), MEDI3617 (orange traces), cediranib (red traces/bars),
or dual therapy (blue traces/bars). (A) In Gl261 tumors, both cediranib and
MEDI3617 monotherapies led to significantly higher overall median survival
(24 d) than control treatment (20 d) (cediranib *P = 0.017; MEDI3617 *P =
0.011; n = 10). Dual therapy (n = 11) led to a significantly higher median
survival (38 d) than control (***P < 0.0001) or cediranib treatment (†P =
0.002). (B) There was a significant difference in the growth rate of tumors
treated with dual therapy compared with both control-treated (***P <
0.0001) and cediranib-treated (†P = 0.0076) tumors as measured by OFDI.
(C) Dual therapy-treated tumors were significantly smaller than cediranib-
treated tumors at day 20 as measured by MRI (†P = 0.0089). (D) There was no
change in the extent of necrosis at day 20 (P = 0.11). (E) In the U87 model, both
cediranib and dual therapy-treated mice had a significantly higher overall
median survival (26 d and 13 d, respectively; n = 13) than control-treated mice
(5 d; n = 12; ***P < 0.0001). (F and G) There was no difference in tumor growth
(F) or volume (G) between dual therapy-treated tumors and cediranib-treated
tumors in the U87 model. (H) There was a significant increase in ischemic

with cediranib-treated tumors at day 6 (†P = 0.030). cedi, cediranib;

monotherapy (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). Thus, dual therapy delayed
GBM progression by slowing the tumor growth rate, resulting in
a lower viable tumor burden in Gl261-bearing mice treated with
dual therapy than in mice treated with cediranib monotherapy.
Interestingly, there was no detectable difference in the growth
rate of U87 tumors treated with cediranib monotherapy or dual
therapy (Fig. 1 F and G), suggesting that the inhibition of tumor
growth was not a chief cause of the observed survival benefit.
This finding is consistent with our previous study in the same
tumor model (11). However, we detected a striking increase in
areas of diffuse hypoxic ischemic change (i.e., early necrosis)
(Fig. S1) by day 6 in the dual therapy-treated tumors as com-
pared with both cediranib- and control-treated tumors (Fig. 1H
and Fig. S2), resulting in a decreased viable tumor burden in
mice treated with dual therapy.

Direct antiproliferative effects were observed in vitro with
high concentrations of cediranib (>103 nM), but MEDI3617 had
no effect on cell viability in either Gl261 or U87 tumors (Fig. S3).
However, histological analyses of tumor apoptosis and pro-
liferation did not reveal significant changes (Fig. S4) in either
U87 or Gl261 tumors, suggesting that alternative mechanisms
are responsible for reduced viable tumor burden.

Dual Therapy Enhances Normalization in Gl261 Tumors Compared with
Cediranib Monotherapy. To determine the effects of cediranib+
MEDI3617 dual therapy on the tumor vasculature, we assessed
vessel morphology. In Gl261 tumors we focused our analysis on
day 14 (the time point of the beginning of the end of cediranib-
induced vascular normalization based on our preliminary studies)
and day 21 (near the median survival of cediranib-treated mice) to

Fig. 2. Dual cediranib+MEDI3617 therapy extends vascular normalization in
viable tissue compared with cediranib therapy alone. Gl261 tumors were
collected from mice treated with cediranib (red bars) or dual therapy (blue
bars) at days 14 or 21 after beginning treatment. Sections were stained for
CD31 (for vessels), desmin (for perivascular cells), or collagen IV (for BM) and
DAPI (for nuclei). (A, B, D) Both MVD (A) and perivascular cell coverage (the
percentage of the desmin/CD31 double-positive area in the CD31+ area)
(B) were higher in the dual therapy-treated tumors than in cediranib-treated
tumors at days 14 and 21, but BM coverage (D) was higher only at day 21.
(C) There was no significant difference in BM thickness among groups.

identify the effects of prolonged dual therapy compared with
cediranib monotherapy. Tumor microvessel density (MVD) and
perivascular cell coverage were higher in the dual therapy group
than in cediranib-treated tumors at day 14, but there were no
differences in the extent of basement membrane (BM) coverage
or thickness (Fig. 2). By day 21, tumor vessels were still structurally
normalized, with significantly higher BM coverage, in the mice
treated with dual therapy (Fig. 2). Overall the vessels in the dual
therapy-treated tumors had a more normalized vessel structure
than the vessels in the cediranib-treated tumors (Fig. 2 E and F).
Because dual therapy induced sustained structural vessel nor-
malization in Gl261, we next investigated whether these changes
could translate to improved edema control. In addition to de-
termining intratumoral edema, we assessed edema in both the
ipsilateral hemisphere (to measure peritumoral edema) and the
contralateral hemisphere (as a control for global changes in
edema). In Gl261 tumors, both cediranib and dual therapy de-
creased edema in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
compared with controls, although only cediranib had a statistically
significant effect (Fig. 3 A and B; dual therapy P = 0.052). There
was no difference among the treatment groups in edema within the
tumor itself (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that edema control is not
the major consequence of the improved normalization in dual
therapy-treated tumors compared with cediranib-treated tumors.

Dual Therapy Improves Structural Vessel Normalization in U87 Tumors
Compared With Cediranib Monotherapy. Vessels were analyzed at
days 3 and 8 after treatment initiation to determine the effects of
therapy during the previously defined time window of normalization
(days 3–8) (10, 11, 27). Tumors treated with either cediranib alone or
dual therapy displayed a significant decrease in MVD and BM
thickness, but not BM coverage, at day 3 compared with control
tumors (Fig. 4 A, C, D, and F). Perivascular cell coverage was sig-
nificantly higher in dual therapy-treated tumors than in vessels from

control- and cediranib-treated tumors (Fig. 4 B and E), suggesting a
greater extent of vessel normalization after dual therapy. Indeed,
after dual therapy GBM vessels exhibit better normalization (Fig. 4
E and F). These features were maintained in both the cediranib- and
dual therapy-treated tumors at day 8. Notably, no control mice
survived to day 8. MEDI3617 monotherapy induced some features
of vessel normalization but did so in an inconsistent manner: Al-
though there was no change in the MVD of MEDI3617-treated
tumors, BM thickness was decreased compared with control tumors
at day 3, and perivascular cell coverage was increased at day 8 (Fig.
4). Thus, as in Gl261 tumors, improved vascular normalization was
observed in dual therapy-treated U87 tumors compared with cedir-
anib-treated tumors. We also found that, as in Gl261 tumors, this
vessel normalization with dual therapy did not translate into better
edema control than seen with cediranib monotherapy (Fig. S5).

Dual Therapy Alters TAM Polarization. We recently demonstrated that
the normalization of tumor vasculature leads to efficient immune cell
recruitment and polarization of TAMs to antitumor phenotypes
(30). Furthermore, Ang-2 blockade recently has been shown to im-
prove tumor cell immune destruction (35). Based on these data we
assessed whether immune cell infiltration or polarization might be
altered by dual therapy in Gl261 tumors at day 10 (when tumors
treated with dual therapy began to show significant delay in tumor
growth as compared with tumors treated with cediranib mono-
therapy) (Fig. 1B). We found that the proportion of F4/80+ TAMs
was significantly changed among treatment groups (Fig. 5A). We
further determined the phenotype of the TAMs using the M1 acti-
vation marker CD11c and the M2 activation marker MRC1. Fig. 5B
and Fig. S6 show representative images of the gating strategy used to
define TAM phenotypes. Although there was no difference among
the treatment groups in either CD11c+MRC1− M1-like TAMs (Fig.
5C) or CD11c−MRC1+ M2-like TAMs (Fig. 5D) alone, there were
significantly more TAMs that did not display a clear M1- or M2-like
activation state, i.e., CD11c+MRC1+ M1–M2 intermediate TAMs,
in MEDI3617-treated tumors than in cediranib- and dual-treated
tumors (Fig. 5E). We detected no significant change in the pro-
portion of other immune cell populations [CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T
cells, and CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)]
(Fig. S7). Moreover, in vitro peritoneal macrophage stimulation
studies showed enhanced expression of the M1-assocated genes such
as Cxcl9, Cxcl11, and Tnfα with dual therapy (Fig. S8). Together,
these results indicate that cediranib and MEDI3617 may have dif-
ferential effects on TAM recruitment and phenotype.

tumors. Gl261-bearing mice (n = 5–7) were treated with control (green bars),
cediranib (red bars), or dual therapy (blue bars). Water content (edema) was
measured on day 10 after treatment start by wet/dry weight ratio in the
contralateral hemisphere (Contra) (A), ipsilateral hemisphere (Ipsi) (B), and

both the contralateral (P = 0.029) and ipsilateral (P = 0.024) hemispheres.
Dual therapy also decreased water content compared with control-treated
tumors, although the decrease did not reach statistical significance (con-
tralateral P = 0.095; ipsilateral P = 0.052). There was no significant difference

The Survival Benefit of Dual Anti-VEGFR/Ang-2 Therapy Is Mediated
by TAMs. To assess a causal role of TAMs in response to dual
therapy, we used an anti–colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)–
neutralizing antibody to block the recruitment of TAMs in
Gl261 tumors (Fig. S9). CSF-1 blockade as a monotherapy or in
combination with MEDI3617 or cediranib had no significant
effect on survival (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10). However, when com-
bined with the dual therapy it significantly compromised the
therapeutic benefits of dual therapy (median survival 10 d vs. 17
d). Interestingly, the survival benefit of dual therapy with anti–
CSF-1 was comparable to that of cediranib monotherapy (Fig.
S10), demonstrating that the additional survival benefit seen
with dual therapy over cediranib monotherapy is mediated
mainly by TAMs.

Discussion
Here we report that combined inhibition of VEGFRs and Ang-2
significantly improves survival over monotherapy arms in murine
GBM models. Dual therapy improved the extent of vascular nor-
malization in two models of GBM, effectively reducing edema to a
similar extent as cediranib monotherapy. Dual therapy delayed
tumor growth in Gl261 tumors and increased tumor necrosis in
U87 tumors. In the murine Gl261 model in immunocompetent
mice, Ang-2/VEGFR blockade showed differential impacts
on TAM recruitment and polarization. Further, blockade of
TAM recruitment by an anti–CSF-1 antibody compromised the
survival benefit of dual therapy to a level similar to that of
cediranib monotherapy.

Our findings are consistent with previous preclinical reports of
combined VEGF and Ang-2 signaling inhibition in various s.c.
and orthotopic non-CNS tumor models (34, 36–41). However, in

contrast to non-CNS models (34, 36, 38, 42–46), we observed
little survival benefit of anti–Ang-2 monotherapy in GBM
models. This result may reflect the greater dependence of GBM
angiogenesis on VEGF. We show that Ang-2 inhibition alone
leads to a modest improvement in vascular normalization and has
no additional effect on intracranial edema or tumor growth. Ad-
ditionally, in U87 tumors the ectopic overexpression of Ang-2 has
little effect on the tumor vasculature or survival but is able to impair
the normalization induced by blocking VEGF signaling (27). These
data suggest that Ang-2 may be more relevant as a therapeutic
target in GBM in the context of VEGF pathway inhibition.

Previously we have shown that the inhibition of VEGF during tu-
mor growth leads to vascular normalization, the extent of which was
associated with survival in preclinical models (10, 11, 27) and GBM
patients (47–50). Recent clinical data suggest that improved tumor
perfusion and oxygenation in both newly diagnosed and rGBM pa-
tients during anti-VEGF therapy correlates with significantly longer
survival than seen in patients whose tumor blood perfusion does not
increase or decreases (47–50). In both U87 and Gl261 tumors dual
therapy resulted in a vasculature that more closely resembled that of
the surrounding brain. In Gl261 tumors this effect occurred without
a reduction in MVD, whereas the more vascularized U87
model required a reduction in MVD to attain the same end point

Fig. 5. Cediranib and MEDI3617 have differential effects on TAM re-
cruitment and polarization in Gl261 tumors. Immune cell profiles in Gl261
tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry on day 10. (A) The percentage of
F4/80+ TAMs was significantly different among treatment groups (ANOVA
P = 0.046; n = 7 or 8). Cediranib monotherapy tended to reduce the per-
centage of TAMs compared with MEDI3617 monotherapy and dual therapy
(P = 0.054 and P = 0.096, respectively). (B) Representative images of the
gating strategy to define TAM phenotypes for each treatment group. TAMs
were defined as one of four phenotypes: M1-like TAM (CD11c+MRC1−),
M2-like (CD11c−MRC1+), M1–M2 intermediate (CD11c+MRC1+), and double-
negative (CD11c−MRC1−) TAMs. (C) There was no significant difference
among treatment groups in the percentage of M1-like TAMs. (D) There was
no significant difference among any of the groups in the percentage of M2-
like TAMs. (E) There was a significant difference among treatment groups in
the percentage of M1–M2 intermediate TAMs that did not display clear M1-
or M2-like activation (ANOVA P = 0.0031). Furthermore, both cediranib
monotherapy and dual therapy significantly reduced the percentage of
these TAMs compared with MEDI3617 monotherapy (*P = 0.0019 and *P =
0.029). (F) There was a trend toward a difference among treatment groups
in the M1/M2 ratio (Kruskal–Wallis test, P = 0.098). Dual therapy tended to
increase M1/M2 ratio compared with cediranib monotherapy (P = 0.053). The
dashed line indicates an M1/M2 ratio of 1. Total TAMs were normalized to
CD45+ cells for comparisons among treatment groups. All TAM phenotypes
described were normalized to total F4/80+ cells for comparisons among
treatment groups. Error bars represent the SEM.

Fig. 6.
Inhibition of macrophage recruitment by CSF-1 blockade compro-
mises the survival benefit of dual cediranib+MEDI3617 therapy. Mice bear-
ing Gl261 tumors were treated with control (n = 16; solid green trace), anti–
CSF-1 (αCSF-1; n = 18; dotted green trace), dual cediranib+MEDI3617 therapy
(n = 28; solid blue trace), or anti–CSF-1 + dual therapy (n = 26; dotted blue
trace). Anti–CSF-1 by itself had no effect on overall median survival com-
pared with control treatment (7 d vs. 6 d). When combined with dual
therapy, however, anti–CSF-1 significantly reduced overall median survival
compared with dual therapy alone (10 d vs. 17 d; *P = 0.003). Dual therapy
with or without combined anti–CSF-1 treatment significantly increased
overall median survival compared with control treatment (P = 0.0035 and P <
0.0001, respectively). These data confirm the role of macrophages as es-
sential mediators of the survival benefits observed with dual therapy.

(i.e., ∼300 vessels/mm2). The resulting extension of vascular nor-
malization beyond that of cediranib monotherapy warrants further
studies in combination with radiation, chemotherapy, or immu-
notherapy, because improvements in the tumor vasculature often
improve the delivery and efficacy of other therapeutics (15).

Vascular normalization can enhance the influx of immune
effector cells into tumors and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing
mice receiving active immunotherapy (15, 51). TAM infiltration is
an important determinant of tumor progression and response to
therapy in GBM and other tumors (31–33). TAMs may be acti-
vated and polarized within a continuum of phenotypes, of which
M1 and M2 macrophages represent two extreme phenotypes,
depending on the specific cytokines and growth factors produced in
the tumor microenvironment. CD11c and MRC1 are commonly
used to identify M1- and M2-like TAMs, respectively (52). In many
malignant tumor settings, including GBM, TAMs are skewed to-
ward a protumoral M2-like phenotype and promote tumor angio-
genesis and progression through the secretion of molecules such as
VEGF and MMP-9 (32, 53–60). Both MEDI3617-treated tumors
(P = 0.054) and dual therapy-treated tumors (P = 0.096) exhibited
a trend toward increased TAMs compared with cediranib-treated
tumors (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that the direct effects of
blocking VEGFR or Tie-2 signaling in TAMs and the indirect
effects via antivascular effects on immune cell populations are
potentially independent. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a
higher M1/M2 ratio in tumors treated with dual therapy than in
tumors treated with cediranib alone (Kruskal–Wallis P = 0.098; P =
0.053 between the cediranib and dual-therapy arms) (Fig. 5E),
suggesting that dual therapy may shift the balance of TAMs toward
an antitumor phenotype. This observation is further supported by
data in our companion paper showing that simultaneous blockade
of Ang-2 and VEGF using a bispecific antibody significantly in-
duces M1-like TAM polarization and increases the M1/M2 ratio
compared with VEGF-inhibition alone in vivo (61).

We also found that the majority of TAMs did not show clear
M1- or M2-like activation and that the proportion of these cells
was significantly altered after dual therapy. The significance of
these populations remains unclear and should be defined in future
studies; however, we speculate that they may represent TAMs
within the M1–M2 continuum that have the plasticity to differ-
entiate into either protumor or antitumor TAMs depending on
the cytokine milieu. In our previous study vascular normalization
increased the production of immune-stimulatory factors while also

reducing immune-suppressive factors in TAMs compared with
control-treated tumors (30). Because dual therapy normalizes the
vasculature, TAMs in dual therapy-treated tumors are adapted to
an antitumor phenotype, as shown in our companion manuscript,
and thus are able to affect survival positively. However, additional
interventions may be necessary to decrease the MDSCs and fur-
ther activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes—for example by immune
checkpoint inhibition—to enhance antitumor adaptive immunity
further (30, 62, 63). Taken together, our data warrant further
studies to assess the therapeutic potential of the anti-VEGF/Ang-2
combination with novel immunotherapeutics in GBM (51, 64).

Reprogramming the tumor immune environment is a prom-
ising therapeutic strategy; preclinical studies blocking TAM
function or repolarizing TAMs show promising survival benefits
in multiple tumor models (58, 65–67). We previously have shown
that anti-VEGF therapy can enhance the recruitment of TAMs
in preclinical GBM models and that the number of TAMs is
negatively correlated with survival in GBM patients, confirming
their potential as a therapeutic target in GBM (11, 68). A recent
preclinical study in GBM found that survival could be enhanced
by shifting the TAM phenotype away from an M2-like phenotype
(33). Here we show that dual blockade of Ang-2 and VEGFR
leads to improved vascular normalization and tends to alter the
TAM phenotype and/or recruitment compared with anti-VEGFR
monotherapy. These changes are associated with delayed GBM
progression and increased survival. This dual targeting approach
may be an effective way to overcome the resistance to anti-VEGF
monotherapy that develops rapidly in patients with GBM.

Materials and Methods
All animal procedures followed Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care of
Laboratory Animals guidelines and were approved by the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. MGH is
accredited with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Labora-
tory Animal Care and the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (A3596-01).
Gl261 and U87 cells were orthotopically implanted into C57BL/6 and nude
mice, respectively, and were monitored for tumor growth using intravital
fluorescence microscopy or optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) (69).
Treatment with IgG control (10 mg/kg) (MedImmune), MEDI3617 (10 mg/kg),
cediranib (6 mg/kg), or dual therapy was initiated at tumor diameters of
2.5 mm in U87 tumors or 2.0 mm in Gl261 tumors. MRI was used to determine
tumor size at the time points described. Tissue was harvested and frozen or
paraffin-embedded for histological analyses. Ki67, cleaved caspase 3, CD31,
collagen IV, and desmin stainings were assessed using MATLAB or Image J.
Edema was assessed using dry/wet weight analysis (11). Tumors were har-
vested at day 10 for flow cytometry, stained for TAM markers, and analyzed
with FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (Tree Star) software. Data are
expressed as mean ± SEM. The t tests were two-sided. For comparisons
among more than two groups ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests were followed
by post hoc multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Ex-
perimental procedures are described in detail in SI Materials and Methods.
