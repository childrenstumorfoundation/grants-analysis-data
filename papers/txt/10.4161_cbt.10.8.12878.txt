The  neurofibroma,  a  common  feature  of  neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1),  is  a  benign  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumor 
that  contains  predominantly  schwann  cells  (sC).  There  are  reports  that  neurofibroma  growth  may  be  affected  by 
hormonal  changes,  particularly  in  puberty  and  pregnancy,  suggesting  an  influence  by  steroid  hormones.  This  study 
examined the effects of estrogen and progesterone on proliferation and apoptosis in a panel of NF1 tumor xenografts. 
sC-enriched cultures derived from three human NF1 tumor types [dermal neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma and 
malignant  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumor  (MpNsT)]  were  xenografted  in  sciatic  nerves  of  ovariectomized  scid/Nf1-/+ 
mice. at the same time, mice were implanted with time-release pellets for systemic delivery of progesterone, estrogen 
or placebo. proliferation and apoptosis by the xenografted sC were examined two months after implantation, by Ki67 
immunolabeling and TUNeL. estrogen was found to increase the growth of all three MpNsT xenografts. progesterone 
was associated with increased growth in two of the three MpNsTs, yet decreased growth of the other. Of the four dermal 
neurofibroma xenografts tested, estrogen caused a statistically significant growth increase in one and progesterone 
did in another. Of the four plexiform neurofibroma sC xenografts, estrogen and progesterone significantly decreased 
growth in one of the xenografts, but not the other three. No relationship of patient age or gender to steroid response was 
observed. These findings indicate that human NF1 schwann cells derived from some tumors show increased proliferation 
or decreased apoptosis in response to particular steroid hormones in a mouse xenograft model. This suggests that anti-
estrogen or anti-progesterone therapies may be worth considering for specific NF1 neurofibromas and MpNsTs.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal domi-
nant disorder with a wide variety of features, the hallmark fea-
ture being neurofibromas.1 Neurofibromas are benign peripheral 
nerve tumors that contain more than 50% Schwann cells (SC). 
Smaller,  cutaneous  or  subcutaneous  neurofibromas  are  termed 
“dermal” here and have no potential for malignancy. However, 
neurofibromas involving larger nerves can become large and have 
a  risk  of  transformation  to  malignant  peripheral  nerve  sheath 
tumor  (MPNST).1  Some  of  the  neurofibroma  SCs  are  clonally 
expanded from a SC whose normal NF1 gene allele was mutated, 
fulfilling  the  tumor  suppressor  two-hit  system.  Neurofibromas 
often first appear around puberty and develop throughout adult-
hood. Pregnancy is often associated with increased size, number 
and  malignant  potential  of  neurofibromas.2-6  Lammert  et  al.7 

reported a survey of 59 NF1 patients that found that while oral 
contraceptive  pills  did  not  stimulate  subjective  growth  of  neu-
rofibromas in the majority of patients, two receiving high dose 
Depo Provera contraceptive did report significant tumor growth. 
Thus,  neurofibroma  growth  often  parallels  hormonal  changes. 
McLaughlin and Jacks8 examined 59 human neurofibromas for 
the expression of estrogen (ER alpha) and progesterone receptors 
(PR) with immunohistochemistry. They found that the majority 
(75%) of neurofibromas had at least a few cells that expressed PR, 
but these cells were S100 negative (therefore not Schwann cells). 
They did not see detectable ER alpha staining. A similar study in 
our lab showed that 54% of neurofibromas were PR-positive and 
that cultured tumor Schwann cells do express steroid hormone 
receptor transcripts.9

Steroid  hormones  are  cholesterol  derivatives  with  important 
roles  in  growth,  metabolism,  differentiation  and  reproduction.

They have been implicated in some cancers, especially breast and 
prostate  cancer.  A  few  biochemical  studies  have  been  done  on 
rodent SCs,10,11 however, only recently has data been published 
regarding  hormone  effects  in  normal  human  or  NF1-tumor 
derived  Schwann  cells.  Recent  in  vitro  data  indicated  that  ste-
roid hormone receptor expression correlated with neurofibromin 
levels in mouse ES-derived Schwann cells and two human tumor 
cultures (from our group).5,6 The plexiform culture did not sig-
nificantly respond to hormones in a proliferation assay, but the 
MPNST  line  showed  increase  in  proliferation  rate  in  response 
to  estrogen  and  progesterone.  Our  group  showed  that  neurofi-
bromin-deficient tumor SC responded to hormones in culture.9 
Overdiek et al.12 also showed an increase in proliferation in neu-
rofibroma SC in response to progesterone. To survey the effect 
of estrogen and progesterone on proliferation and apoptosis in a 
series of human neurofibroma Schwann cells in vivo, we employed 
a sciatic nerve xenograft model in ovariectomized scid/Nf1 mice 
treated with progesterone or estrogen. Human SC derived from 
three NF1 tumor types (dermal neurofibroma, plexiform neuro-
fibroma and MPNST) were tested by assaying proliferation and 
apoptosis  of  the  xenografted  SC  using  immunohistochemistry. 
This is the first such in vivo NF1 study.

Results

Eleven  SC  cultures  (from  four  dermal  neurofibromas,  three 
MPNSTs  and 
from 

four  plexiform  neurofibromas)  (five

females, six from males) were tested using a total of 104 sciatic 
nerve xenografts. The xenograft results were consistent for each 
culture; there were virtually no statistical outliers. As indicated 
previously, MPNST sNF96.2 grew the most dramatically (Fig. 
1) with the sciatic nerve massively enlarged under estrogen treat-
ment  (and  still  visibly  enlarged  in  placebo  and  progesterone 
treatment).17 However, most of the xenografts did not produce 
grossly enlarged nerves. Figure 2 shows an example of one of the 
plexiform SC cultures and Figure 3 shows an example of xeno-
graft immunostaining. hGST staining was detected in multiple 
cells  in  each  xenograft,  indicating  that  human  cells  were  pres-
ent in the sciatic nerve 2 months after the xenograft injection. 
Proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 staining and 
TUNEL  staining  of  xenograft  sections,  respectively.  All  xeno-
grafts had at least some Ki67-positive hGST-positive cells except 
for cNF04.9a, a dermal neurofibroma-enriched SC culture which

failed to form a mass in one nerve each in two mice (one pla-
cebo, one estrogen). For all xenografts, the average ratios of Ki67/
TUNEL positive cells in the same size area from serial sections 
were  compared  between  the  treatment  groups  (estrogen  versus 
placebo, progesterone versus placebo). Results are illustrated by 
graphs in Figure 4. An increase in this ratio (i.e., increased sur-
vival and/or increased proliferation) is consistent with increased 
cell  mass  in  treatment  relative  to  placebo.  Similarly  a  decrease 
indicates reduction in cell mass relative to placebo.

In  all  four  dermal-derived  SC  culture  xenografts  (where 
human  cells  were  evident),  there  is  suggestion  of  increased 
tumor  cell  mass  in  presence  of  estrogen  and/or  progesterone 
(Fig. 4A). This met statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) in dermal 
culture cNF97.5 with estrogen (p = 0.0189) and dermal culture 

cNF99.1 with progesterone (p = 0.0108) (Fig. 4A). In the pres-
ence of progesterone, cNF97.5 had a growth trend but it was not 
statistically  significant  (p  =  0.895).  Figure  5  shows  sections  of 
the  dermal  neurofibroma  cNF97.5  xenograft,  illustrating  the 
significant  increase  in  cell  mass  with  estrogen  but  not  proges-
terone. For the plexiform neurofibroma SC xenografts, the ratio 
of proliferation: apoptosis showed a decrease trend in the pres-
ence of estrogen (for pNF00.13, pNF95.6 and pNF95.11b) and 
progesterone (same three cultures) (Fig. 4A). This was statisti-
cally  significant  for  estrogen  and  progesterone  in  pNF95.11b, 
while both hormones were associated with increase in pNF01.1 
(not  statistically  significant,  but  the  number  of  surviving  cells 
for  pNF01.1  was  very  small  and  thus  most  subject  to  error)  
(Fig. 4A). For MPNST-derived SC xenografts, there was a trend of

increasing cell mass in the presence of estrogen for all three cul-
tures, which was statistically significant in sNF96.2 and sNF94.3 
(Fig. 4). Progesterone was associated with a trend of increasing 
cell  mass  in  sNF94.3  and  sNF02.2  xenografts  relative  to  pla-
cebo, but decreasing cell mass compared to placebo in sNF96.2  
(Fig. 4).

MPNST sNF96.2 produced the most interesting results due 
to its massive expansion in vivo. This xenograft best resembles 
an  MPNST,17  while  another  MPNST  xenograft  (sNF94.3, 
which did not grow as robustly) better fits histology criteria for 
a plexiform neurofibroma.16 This culture was remarkable in that 
estrogen was associated with tremendous growth, greater than 
under  placebo  conditions  (Figs.  1  and  4B).  Yet  progesterone 
was associated with failure of the xenografts to achieve placebo-
level  growth  (Fig.  4B).  Immunohistochemistry  of  sNF96.2 
xenografts for progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor 
(ERα & ERβ) showed a negative result for all three receptors 
with DAB detection, compared to positive control slides (tonsil 
for PR, breast cancer for ERα, colon cancer for ERβ, data not 
shown).  In  addition,  we  also  xenografted  sNF96.2  into  ovari-
ectomized/pellet-implanted  female  scid  mice  lacking  the  Nf1 
heterozygous  background.  In  comparison  to  the  Nf1(+/-)/scid 
results, the scid-only xenografts grew less robustly, regardless of 
hormone treatment (statistically significant) (Fig. 6).

Discussion

The neurofibroma clonal tumorigenic cell is the Schwann cell, 
containing  somatic  loss  of  function  of  the  remaining  NF1 
allele.21-23 Thus, these tumors (and MPNSTs) are heterogeneous 
in terms of different combinations of germline/somatic NF1 (and 
in some cases, other genes) mutations, cytogenetics, expression 
array  results  and  presence  of  a  number  of  antigens.8,9,14,21,22,24-46 
Given this, and variable patient reports about whether their neu-
rofibromas were affected by pregnancy, it is not surprising that 
this study found heterogeneous results.

MPNST sNF96.2 showed robust response to estrogen. The 
MPNST  sNF96.2  data  suggest  that  at  least  for  this  culture,  a 
germline  background  of  heterozygosity  for  a  disruptive  Nf1 
mutation in the recipient mouse is more permissive for increased 
growth  under  hormone  influence  compared  to  the  scid-only 
background (wild-type at Nf1 locus). Interestingly, this MPNST 
xenograft grows less robustly in male recipient mice, even smaller 
than  female-placebo.17  Estrogen  induced  a  greater  xenograft 
growth than placebo and progesterone actually somewhat inhib-
ited growth compared to placebo. Thus, this cell line is clearly 
differentially  responsive  to  hormones  and  genetic  background. 
Such complexity may be true of many neurofibroma clonal SC, 
but the sNF96.2 cell line amplified sufficiently in vivo to clearly

observe  these  properties.  Although  progesterone  and  estrogen 
receptors  were  not  detected  in  the  xenograft,  they  may  still  be 
present at low levels as seen in some SC in vitro previously (or 
there may be additional receptors not yet identified).5 Consistent 
with  this  is  the  previous  observation  that  these  receptor  tran-
scripts  are  undetectable  in  this  cell  line  and  barely  detectable 
in RNA from primary tumor (using real-time PCR) and treat-
ment with ligands had no effect on proliferation or apoptosis in 
culture.9 Alternatively, it may be that the hormones are exerting 
effects through non-genomic mechanisms, regardless of karyo-
type, a phenomenon increasingly under study.47

Some  xenografts  of  all  three  tumor  types  respond  to  hor-
mones:  clinical  significance.  Although  estrogen  and  proges-
terone showed variable effects on xenograft growth, there were 
consistent results specific to each tumor culture. Responses are 
not related to patient age or tumor type, although most of the sig-
nificant responding cultures were from males, and/or were from 
MPNSTs. The data support a functional role of steroid hormones 
in tumor growth in some individuals and/or tumors (3/11 posi-
tive for response to estrogen; 2/11 positive response to progester-
one; 1/11 negative response to estrogen; 2/11 negative response 
to progesterone). These responses were in independent cell cul-
tures  except  for  sNF96.2  (described  above)  and  pNF95.11b, 
which  showed  inhibition  by  both  hormones  compared  to  pla-
cebo.  Overall,  these  observations  suggest  that  hormone-related 
therapies may be of potential use in controlling growth of some 
NF1  tumors.  This  is  feasible  even  in  the  absence  of  hormone 
receptors  since  some  such  agents  (e.g.,  tamoxifen)  can  exert 
effects independent of estrogen receptor status.48-51 Future work 
could  involve  expression  array  or  proteomic  studies  comparing 
responding and non-responding tumors, to develop a profile that 
might  predict  response  to  hormones  and  thus  suggest  possible 
efficacy of anti-hormone therapies. If the mechanisms through 
which  the  hormones  act  in  these  tumors  are  characterized,  we 
may be able to identify alternative therapeutic targets that are not 
directed at the hormones/receptors themselves, such as underway 
in breast cancer.52 Although the two month interval was sufficient 

to show proof of principle in this experiment, extended xenograft 
time beyond 2 months would yield larger tumors, which could 
be  useful  for  preclinical  studies  to  measure  treatment  efficacy. 
This xenograft system could also be used to measure effects of  
hormone-related  (or  other)  therapies,  especially  those  aimed  at 
the  hormones  known  to  stimulate  certain  tumor  cell  cultures. 
This work contributes to the growing evidence that steroid hor-
mones can play an important role in NF1 tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods

Neurofibroma  SC  culture.  NF1  tumor-derived  Schwann  cells 
were  isolated  from  surgical  specimens  of  neurofibromas  or 
MPNSTs,  from  patients  (age  1–35  years)  meeting  NF1  diag-
nostic  criteria,  under  IRB  approval.13  Our  SC  culture  protocol 
that favors NFl-/- cells has been described previously.14 To briefly 
review, viable tumor was isolated from surgically resected neu-
rofibromas  and  single  cell  suspensions  were  created.  The  cells 
were then cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium sup-
plemented  with  15%  fetal  bovine  serum,  50  ng/ml  neuregulin 
(GGF2)  and  antibiotics  (Pen/Strep)  on  laminin-coated  plates. 
Schwann cells were enriched to 70–95% by differential detach-
ment over several passages, using mild trypsinization. Cultures 
were characterized with S-100, P-75 (NGFR) and Ki-67 immu-
nostaining. The three MPNST cultures we established are avail-
able at ATCC and do not require laminin or neuregulin.

Xenograft. The Nf1Fcr mutation on a C57BL/6 background15 
was  bred  to  B6.CB17  immunodeficient  scid  mice  (Jackson 
Laboratories # 001913) through several generations to produce 
the desired “NSS” mice (Nf1 heterozygote and scid homozygote) 
for  xenograft.  This  xenograft  system  is  well-established  in  our 
lab.16,17 As approved by UF IACUC, bilateral ovariectomy, hor-
mone pellet implant and sciatic nerve xenograft were performed 
on 8-week-old female mice. Under anesthesia, a 1.0 cm incision 
was made in the skin to expose the back muscles. A small 0.2 
cm  incision  was  made  in  the  muscles  overlying  the  ovaries  on 
both sides. The ovaries were isolated, tied off with sterile sutures

and removed. The muscles and the skin were sutured separately. 
Ovariectomized females were then implanted with 60-day release 
pellets of either17b-estradiol (0.72 mg/pellet, cat # SE-121), pro-
gesterone (25 mg/pellet, SP-131) or placebo (SC-111) (Innovative 
Research of America). This is the established system for provid-
ing  steady-state  physiologic  blood  levels  of  these  hormones  in 
isolation.18-20  Human  tumor  derived  Schwann  cells  [5  x  105/5 
ul (see below)] were then injected intra-fascicularly in the surgi-
cally-exposed sciatic nerve of each leg. This was sutured and the 
animals  were  returned  to  SPF  housing  for  2  months.  We  used 
three mice per treatment group, for a total of six xenografts for 
each treatment. All xenografts were performed on the same day 
for each culture, using the same batch of cells.

Analysis  of  xenograft.  Sciatic  nerves  were  harvested  two 
months after surgery, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin 
embedded longitudinally. Serial sections (7 μm) were cut from 
each block through the entire nerve, and staining/immunohis-
tochemistry was performed with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin 
staining),  hGST  (human  glutathione  transferase),  Ki67  and 
TUNEL as described below. Every 7th section was H&E stained 
for  light  microscopy  examination.  Based  on  this,  three  sets  of 
three serial sections across the widest area of the graft were used 
to determine proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio.

For hGST staining (using human-specific antibody), endog-
enous peroxidases were quenched with 1% hydrogen peroxide 
in  methanol  for  30  minutes.  After  washing  in  PBS,  the  rab-
bit  polyclonal  anti-human  hGST  antibody  (Cat#  107;  Dako, 
Carpinteria, CA) was added at a 1:100 dilution. Staining was 
detected with 1:500 dilution of swine anti-rabbit biotinylated 
conjugated-secondary  antibody  and  ABC,  3,3'-diaminobenzi-
dine as a substrate for peroxidase. For Ki67 staining, to iden-
tify proliferating cells, endogenous peroxidases were quenched 
with 1% H2O2 in methanol for 30 minutes. To unmask anti-
gens, samples were pre-treated in Target Retrieval Solution (10 
mM  citrate  buffer,  pH  6.0,  Dako  Cat#  S-1700;  Carpinteria, 
CA)  at  95–99°C  for  30  minutes.  The  rabbit  polyclonal  anti-
human Ki67 antibody (Cat # 21174418, Zymed, San Francisco, 

CA) was used at a 1:100 dilution. Staining was detected with 
a 1:500 dilution of swine anti-rabbit biotinylated conjugated-
secondary  antibody  and  ABC,  3,3'-diaminobenzidine  as  a 
substrate  for  peroxidase.  For  TUNEL  (TdT-mediated  dUTP 
Nick-End  Labeling)  staining  of  cells  undergoing  apoptosis, 
the DeadEndTM Fluorometric Tunel System Kit (Cat# G3250, 
Promega, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. This system used fluorescent detection. PR 
immunohistochemical staining has been previously described.9 
ERalpha and ERbeta staining (DAB detection) were done by 
the  Shands  Diagnostic  Resource  Lab  and  the  UF  Molecular 
Pathology Core, respectively.

Statistical  analysis.  For  most  of  the  xenografts,  sciatic 
nerves weren’t visibly enlarged or enlarged in a uniform shape, 
so volumetric analysis was not possible. Instead, human (hGST 
positively-stained)  cells  within  entire  xenograft  sections  were 
counted.  However,  for  the  large  xenograft  developed  from 
culture  SNF96.2,  we  chose  three  representative  non-adjacent 
areas in the GST-positive region for counting, at x400 magni-
fication. The ratio of Ki67/TUNEL positive staining cells in 
the same area was compared from serial sections in each group 
(estrogen, progesterone, placebo). The average number of Ki67-
positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells from three slides each 
was calculated for each sample. Data from all six xenografted 
nerves were averaged for each culture and condition, with and 
without Dixon outlier analysis. Ki67/TUNEL ratios were cal-
culated  for  each  group  (placebo,  estrogen  and  progesterone). 
The results were analyzed with a two-tailed unpaired t-test to 
compare  effects  for  estrogen  versus  placebo  and  progesterone 
versus placebo.
