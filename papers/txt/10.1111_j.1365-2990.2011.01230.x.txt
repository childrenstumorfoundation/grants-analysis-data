Low-grade gliomas as neurodevelopmental disorders: insights from mouse models of
neuroﬁbromatosis-1

Over the past few years, the traditional view of brain
tumorigenesis has been revolutionized by advances in
genomic medicine, molecular biology, stem cell biology
and genetically engineered small-animal modelling. We
now appreciate that paediatric brain tumours arise follow-
ing speciﬁc genetic mutations in specialized groups of pro-
genitor cells in concert with permissive changes in the
local tumour microenvironment. This interplay between
preneoplastic/neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic stromal
cells is nicely illustrated by the neuroﬁbromatosis type

1-inherited cancer syndrome, in which affected children
develop low-grade astrocytic gliomas. In this review, we
will use neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 as a model system to
highlight the critical role of growth control pathways,
non-neoplastic cellular elements and brain region-speciﬁc
properties in the development of childhood gliomas. The
insights derived from examining each of these contribut-
ing factors will be instructive in the design of new thera-
pies for gliomas in the paediatric population.

Introduction

The most common solid tumours in children are primary
brain tumours, contributing 22% of all childhood neo-
plasms. Of the primary brain tumours, gliomas represent
the most frequent pathologic type and the leading cause
of cancer-related death in children [1–3]. While the over-
all survival of children with low-grade glioma is good
compared with other types, there are often signiﬁcant
cognitive and neuroendocrine adverse effects following
successful adjuvant therapy [4]. In this regard, many
children experience declines in their IQ and school per-
formance, difﬁculties with executive function (attention

deﬁcit), behaviour/social problems and hypothalamic/
pituitary axis abnormalities [4–8].

Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of central nervous
system (CNS) tumours and include astrocytomas, oligo-
dendrogliomas and ependymomas. However, in children,
the most common glioma is the WHO grade I pilocytic
astrocytoma (PA) [9,10]. These tumours typically arise
during the ﬁrst two decades of life, without a clear sex
predilection. PAs can occur sporadically or in the context
of the neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1)-inherited cancer
syndrome. In either case, PAs usually affect midline struc-
tures, including the cerebellum, optic pathway and brain-
stem (Figure 1). On neuroimaging, PAs of the cerebellum
appear as well-circumscribed and contrast-enhancing
lesions, whereas those involving the optic pathway pre-
sent as fusiform masses. Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)
can also exhibit prominent gadolinium contrast enhance-
ment on magnetic resonance imaging.

Figure 1. Location of sporadic and neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). Sagittal magnetic resonance
images of the normal brain illustrate the most common locations for sporadic PA compared to NF1-associated PA. Whereas sporadic PAs
tend to form in the cerebellum and optic pathway, NF1-associated PAs uncommonly arise in the cerebellum.

Pilocytic astrocytomas occasionally inﬁltrate adjacent
CNS parenchyma, especially when they involve the optic
pathways. Involvement of the subarachnoid space and
leptomeningeal invasion are also not uncommon and do
not necessarily indicate aggressive or malignant behav-
iour [10]. Malignant transformation is exceedingly rare,
and some PAs have been reported to regress without
medical intervention [11].

Histologically, PAs have a biphasic architecture with
both cystic
components and solid cellular areas
(Figure 2A,B). Characteristically, they contain Rosenthal
ﬁbres and eosinophilic granular bodies, but typically do
not harbour necrosis. Tumour cells express glial ﬁbrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), indicative of their glial (astrocytic)
histogenesis (Figure 2C,D). Mitotic activity is usually low,
and the growth fraction as estimated by Ki-67 immunola-
belling is less than 1% [12]. While these tumours are low-
grade neoplasms, they are vascular and can exhibit
microvascular proliferation.

Genetic alterations in paediatric
low-grade gliomas

Until recently, the most common genetic alteration asso-
ciated with PAs was mutational inactivation of the NF1
tumour suppressor gene. However, this mutation is only
found in NF1-associated gliomas, and has not been
reported as a causative molecular change in sporadic
(non-NF1) paediatric low-grade gliomas [13–15]. The

NF1 gene product, neuroﬁbromin, functions as a negative
regulator of the p21-RAS proto-oncogene [16], such that
loss of neuroﬁbromin in NF1-associated gliomas results in
increased RAS activation and cell growth [17] (Figure 3).
The ﬁnding that RAS activation is observed in NF1-
associated PA prompted several laboratories to determine
whether mutational RAS activation accounted for spo-
radic PA tumorigenesis. However, this speciﬁc genetic
alteration is a rare event in sporadic PA, observed in only
2–3% of cases [18,19].

Using converging genomic and gene expression strate-
gies, recent work has culminated in the identiﬁcation of
signature mutations in the BRAF gene as a common
mutation in sporadic PA [20–25]. BRAF is a brain RAF
kinase molecule containing an amino terminal structure
and a carboxyl terminal kinase domain. The amino ter-
minal region is thought to regulate the activity of the
kinase domain, such that the removal of this amino ter-
minal domain results in unchecked BRAF kinase activity
and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
mitogenic signalling. While BRAF-activating mutations,
as seen in melanoma [26], are not typically observed in
sporadic PA, genetic rearrangements result in the cre-
ation of a fusion molecule in which a portion of the
KIAA1549 gene is fused to the kinase domain of the
BRAF gene [20–25]. Two-thirds of PAs are associated
with this novel KIAA1549:BRAF gene fusion, which
results in constitutive activation of the MAPK signalling
pathway [27] (Figure 4). In addition, the presence of this

signature mutation is more commonly seen in cerebel-
lar PAs [28], where it confers a threefold increase in
progression-free survival [29].

Based on the discovery of the KIAA1549:BRAF muta-
tional event in sporadic PAs, several reports have described
other fusion rearrangements involving BRAF, including
FAM131B-BRAF [30]. Similarly, oncogenic RAF1 rear-
rangements have also been reported in some sporadic
PAs [31].

Interestingly, RAF expression alone in the brains of
genetically engineered mice does not result in glioma for-
mation, unless coupled with protein kinase-B (Akt) acti-
vation or Arf tumour suppressor gene loss [32]. Similarly,
activated BRAF expression alone is insufﬁcient for glio-
magenesis, but does result in glioma development when

combined with Ink4a/Arf loss [33]. In contrast, a recent
report demonstrated that somatic retroviral delivery of
mutationally activated BRAF into the brains of newborn
mice results in the development of astrocytomas, with
histological features matching the human disease [34].
Future mouse modelling will be required to reconcile these
differences in experimental outcomes as well as to deter-
mine how deregulated BRAF function and deregulated
MAPK signalling, as seen following KIAA1549:BRAF
expression, result in glioma formation.

proliferation. Neuroﬁbromin functions as a glial cell tumour
suppressor protein by accelerating the conversion of the RAS
proto-oncogene from its active GTP-bound state to its inactive
GDP-bound state. Loss of neuroﬁbromin expression, as seen in
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1-associated gliomas, leads to increased
RAS-GTP levels and hyperactivation of downstream Akt/mTOR
signalling pathways to result in higher levels of cell proliferation.

pigmentary abnormalities (café-au-lait macules, skin-fold
freckling and iris Lisch nodules) are common in affected
individuals [35], 15–20% of children with NF1 develop
low-grade gliomas (PAs) of the optic pathway and brain-
stem (Figure 5). NF1-associated OPGs usually present at a
younger age than sporadic OPGs. NF1-associated gliomas
are typically detected by 4–5 years of age and rarely grow
after age 10 years, whereas sporadic PAs are commonly
ﬁrst diagnosed in the second decade of life. In children
with NF1, PAs form anywhere between the optic globe
and the optic radiations, although the anterior optic
pathway (optic nerves and chiasm) is most frequently
involved. Inﬁltration of the post-chiasmal optic radiations
is found in 10% of individuals with NF1-associated OPG,
and is usually associated with more aggressive clinical
behaviour [36].

Whereas sporadic OPG usually affects only one optic
nerve, it is common to encounter bilateral optic nerve

involvement in children with NF1. NF1-associated OPGs
can be large and exhibit prominent contrast enhancement
on magnetic resonance imaging. However, neither the size
nor degree of contrast enhancement correlates with the
clinical behaviour of the tumour. In this regard, the clini-
cal course of NF1-associated OPGs tends to be more indo-
lent compared to their sporadic counterparts. While 15%
of patients with NF1 develop OPGs [37,38], only one-third
of children require treatment for clinical progression
(visual loss, endocrinopathy). First-line treatment in the
majority of cases is carboplatin/vincristine chemotherapy.
Response rates range from 30% to 50%, and as many as
70% of children exhibit no further tumour growth while
on treatment [39–42].

NF1 gene function

The NF1 gene is a large tumour suppressor gene located
on chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes a 220–250 kDa
protein called neuroﬁbromin [43–45]. Neuroﬁbromin is
expressed by numerous different cell types, including neu-
rones, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, adrenal medulla,
muscle and skin [46–48]. Based on its predicted protein
sequence, neuroﬁbromin was hypothesized to function
primarily as a negative regulator of the p21-RAS proto-
oncogene [49,50]. A small portion of the neuroﬁbromin

protein shares sequence similarity with a family of mol-
ecules called GTPase-activating protein (GAPs) that func-
tion to inactivate RAS and reduce RAS-mediated growth
signalling. Increased RAS activation leads to increased cell
proliferation, and oncogenic transformation in some cell
types, supporting the notion that neuroﬁbromin negative
growth regulation operates through RAS inhibition. In
this regard,
loss of neuroﬁbromin in NF1-associated
tumours is associated with increased levels of RAS
activation [51–53].

Downstream RAS effectors relevant to neuroﬁbromin
growth regulation in neuroglial cells include Akt, mamma-
lian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and MAPK. While BRAF
regulates MAPK signalling, neuroﬁbromin primarily regu-
lates Akt/mTOR signalling in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo
[54]. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the
phosphorylation of several downstream targets, and is
important in ribosomal biogenesis [55].The Akt/mTOR
pathway is hyperactivated in Nf1-/- astrocytes, as evi-
denced by increased activity (and phosphorylation) of the
ribosomal S6 protein [54,56]. In OPG mouse models and in
human PA, phosphorylated S6 expression is detectable in
astrocytes. Nf1-/- astrocytes exhibit increased prolifera-
tion in vitro, which is blocked by rapamycin, a pharmaco-
logical inhibitor of mTOR [54]. The ﬁnding that mTOR
inhibition blocks Nf1-deﬁcient glial cell growth prompted
preclinical genetically engineered mouse (GEM) studies
aimed at determining whether rapamycin might be a
suitable targeted therapy for NF1-associated glioma.

In addition to RAS regulation, neuroﬁbromin positively
controls intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) levels [57,58]. While neuroﬁbromin loss in NF1-
associated neuroglial cells leads to increased RAS and RAS
pathway activation, reduced neuroﬁbromin expression
results in attenuated intracellular cAMP levels. Consistent
with this prediction, Nf1-/- astrocytes have decreased
basal levels of cAMP [58,59]. Numerous cytokines func-
tion by binding G protein-coupled receptors and control
cell growth and survival in a cAMP-dependent fashion
[60]. One of these cytokines, CXCL12 (or stroma-derived
factor-1-alpha) is highly expressed along the optic nerve
in young children and mice [59]. CXCL12 normally
increases cAMP levels in wild-type astrocytes to result in
increased programmed cell death (apoptosis). In contrast,
CXCL12 treatment of Nf1-deﬁcient astrocytes leads to
inappropriate cell survival [59]. This observation suggests
that therapies targeting cAMP may have utility in the
treatment of NF1-associated glioma.

Determinants of gliomagenesis

The unique predilection for NF1-associated gliomas to
form in the optic pathway in young children raises the
intriguing possibility that gliomagenesis requires more
than NF1 gene inactivation in glial progenitor cells.
Several clinical observations support the requirement for
other conditions for glioma development in children with
NF1. First, while sporadic PAs commonly form in the cer-
ebellum, this is an unusual location for NF1-associated
PA. Second, NF1-associated PAs arise in younger children
and are frequently less clinically aggressive. Third, the
majority of children with NF1 do not develop gliomas,
despite having a genetic susceptibility.

The underlying explanations for the pattern of glioma-
genesis in NF1 are likely to reﬂect: (i) differences in suscep-
tibilities of preneoplastic neuroglial cell types in the CNS;
(ii) contributions from non-neoplastic cells and signals
in the tumour microenvironment; and (iii) genomic
modiﬁers that confer glioma risk.

Neuroglial populations respond differently to
NF1 gene inactivation

The notion that neuroglial cells (astrocytes and astroglial
progenitors) from different regions of the CNS are distinct
has recently gained traction. Elegant studies by Richard
Gilbertson and colleagues have demonstrated that
another glial neoplasm (ependymoma) is comprised of
separate tumour types based on their cell of origin and
genetic background [61]. Based on these ﬁndings, it is
possible that NF1-associated PAs are distinct from their
sporadic counterparts, not only with respect to causative
mutation (BRAF activation vs. NF1 gene loss), but also
cell of origin. In this regard, the molecular signature of
NF1-associated PA was found to be distinct from that seen
in sporadic PA [62].

The contribution of cellular heterogeneity to the
pattern of gliomagenesis in NF1 is supported by recent
studies demonstrating that mouse astrocytes and neural
stem cells from different brain regions differ in their ability
to proliferate in response to Nf1 gene inactivation. While
astrocytes from the mouse optic nerve and brainstem
express neuroﬁbromin, neocortical astrocytes have sig-
niﬁcantly lower levels of Nf1 gene expression [63]. These
differences in neuroﬁbromin expression account for the
response of these distinct astroglial cell populations to Nf1
gene inactivation: astrocytes from the brainstem and optic

nerve increase their proliferation in vitro and in vivo follow-
ing Nf1 gene loss, while those from the neocortex fail to
increase their growth [63].

In addition, neuroﬁbromin dictates the proliferation of
neural stem cells and gliogenesis in a brain region-speciﬁc
manner [64]. Mouse neural stem cells from the brainstem
increase their proliferation in vitro and their capacity to
form differentiated glial cells in vivo following Nf1 gene
inactivation. In contrast, Nf1-deﬁcient mouse neural stem
cells from the cortex exhibit no signiﬁcant increase in pro-
liferation or glial differentiation relative to their wild-type
counterparts. This cell autonomous difference in neural
stem cell behaviour does not reﬂect neuroﬁbromin expres-
sion levels, but rather the expression of one component of
the mTOR complex, rictor, which speciﬁes Akt activation.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that neuroglial
cells from different brain regions respond uniquely to
neuroﬁbromin loss and that these differences may partly
determine why gliomas form in the optic pathway and
brainstem of children with NF1.

The contribution of the tumour
microenvironment to glioma formation
and growth

Studies in other cancers have revealed an important role
for the tumour microenvironment in promoting tumour
formation and growth [65–67]. The need for a permissive
microenvironment in NF1-associated gliomagenesis is
nicely illustrated by Nf1 GEM modelling experiments. Mice
lacking Nf1 gene expression in astroglial progenitors
alone do not form brain tumours [68], whereas Nf1+/-
mice lacking Nf1 gene expression in these same astroglial
progenitors develop optic gliomas [69,70]. Nf1+/- mice
have reduced neuroﬁbromin expression in every cell of
their body and brain, similar to children born with NF1.
The requirement for reduced Nf1 gene expression in the
non-neoplastic cells of the brain supports a model in
which gliomagenesis involves the productive interplay
between Nf1+/- stromal cells and Nf1-/- preneoplastic/
neoplastic cells (Figure 6).

Because Nf1 loss in astroglial progenitors must be
coupled with reduced Nf1 gene expression in non-
neoplastic (Nf1+/-) cells, Nf1+/- stromal cells must
produce key growth/survival factors that facilitate Nf1
OPG formation. In both human NF1-associated OPGs and
Nf1 GEM OPGs, there are numerous other cell types
present, including non-neoplastic microglia, endothelial

Figure 6. Gliomagenesis requires the interplay between neoplastic
and non-neoplastic cellular elements. Paediatric glioma formation
ensues following cancer-causing genetic mutations in susceptible
preneoplastic cells (glial cells or stem cells), leading to increased
glial cell proliferation. These glial lineage cells elaborate molecules
(‘stromagens’) that recruit non-neoplastic cells (microglia, blood
vessels and reactive astrocytes) to form a microenvironment
permissive for tumour evolution. The non-neoplastic cells in the
tumour microenvironment in turn produce additional molecules
(‘gliomagens’) that further promote neoplastic glial cell growth,
neoplastic transformation and tumour progression.

cells and reactive astrocytes. Microglia appear early in the
evolving Nf1 mouse OPG [71], which suggests that they
may be important stromal cells relevant to glioma forma-
tion and growth. These immune system-like cells comprise
as many as 30% of the cells in human NF1-associated PAs
[72] and produce numerous growth factors and cytokines
[73,74].

The importance of microglia to NF1-associated optic
glioma growth is underscored by several experimental
observations. First, Nf1+/-, but not wild-type, microglia
increase the proliferation of Nf1-/- astrocytes in vitro
[75]. Second, soluble factors made by Nf1+/- microglia
increase the proliferation of Nf1-deﬁcient astrocytes in
vitro [75]. Third, inhibition of microglia function attenu-
ates Nf1 mouse OPG proliferation in vivo. In these experi-
ments, blocking microglial activation with the antibiotic
minocycline reduces Nf1 OPG growth [75]. Similarly,
inhibiting the signalling pathway responsible for Nf1+/
- microglial function results in decreased Nf1 OPG prolif-
eration in vivo [76]. Finally, genetic ablation of microglia
leads to reduced optic nerve glioma proliferation in vivo
[72]. Collectively, these observations establish microglia

as one of the key stromal cell types that drives glioma
growth.

Based on in vitro experiments demonstrating that
Nf1+/- microglia produce soluble factors that increase
Nf1-deﬁcient astrocyte growth, we sought to identify these
glioma-promoting molecules (gliomagens). Two such
gliomagens have been studied, meningioma-expressed
antigen-5 (MGEA5) and CXCL12. Nf1+/- microglia
express higher levels of MGEA5, a member of the hyalu-
ronidase family of enzymes, than their wild-type counter-
parts. While the role of MGEA5 and related hyaluronidase
molecules in NF1-associated gliomagenesis has not been
fully elucidated, hyaluridonase treatment of Nf1-deﬁcient
astrocytes increases their proliferation, and inhibition of
hyaluronidase function ameliorates the growth advantage
conferred by Nf1+/- microglia [75]. Additional studies
will be required to clarify the role of this interesting mol-
ecule as a gliomagen in the formation and growth of
NF1-associated gliomas.

In addition, Nf1+/- microglia produce two to threefold
more CXCL12 than wild-type microglia. The importance
of CXCL12 to gliomagenesis is underscored by several
observations. First, CXCL12 increases the survival of
Nf1-/- astrocytes in a cAMP-dependent fashion, but leads
to increased apoptosis in wild-type astrocytes [59].
Second, pharmacological inhibition of cAMP degradation
using a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, Rolipram,
attenuates Nf1 mouse OPG growth in vivo [77]. Third,
lentiviral expression of CXCL12 in the forebrain of Nf1
OPG mice results in low-penetrance glioma formation
[78]. To more effectively lower cyclic AMP levels and
mimic the effect of CXCL12 on Nf1-deﬁcient astroglial
cells, lentiviral delivery of PDE4 into the forebrains of Nf1
optic glioma mice results in a greater incidence of glioma
formation [77].

Together, these ﬁndings suggest that gliomagenesis and
continued tumour growth require interactions between
non-neoplastic and neoplastic cell types. We envision
a model in which Nf1-deﬁcient preneoplastic glial pro-
genitor cells produce molecules that attract microglia
and other non-neoplastic cell types (stromagens). These
stromagens create a microenvironment that supports
glioma formation. In turn, the attracted Nf1+/- stromal
cells (microglia) elaborate gliomagens (growth factors and
cytokines) that facilitate further Nf1-deﬁcient astroglial
cell proliferation/survival and permit neoplastic transfor-
mation. Each of these factors represents a potential target
for stroma-directed therapies that aim to inhibit the

formation of a permissive tumour microenvironment or
block the tumour-promoting activity of stroma-derived
gliomagens.

Genomic determinants of gliomagenesis

As 80–85% of children with NF1 do not develop OPGs
while the vast majority (90–95%) of Nf1 genetically engi-
neered mice harbouring identical genetic changes do, it is
likely that subtle genomic alterations dictate which chil-
dren with NF1 will develop a brain tumour. In experimen-
tal Nf1 mouse models, the speciﬁc genetic background
greatly inﬂuences glioma development. Mice heterozygous
for mutations in the Nf1 and Trp53 (p53) tumour suppres-
sor genes (Nf1+/-; Trp53+/- cis; NPcis mice) develop brain
gliomas at a much higher frequency on the B6/C57BL/6J
(B6) genetic background compared to the 129S4/SvJae
(129S4) background [79–81]. These ﬁndings support the
existence of epigenetic or polymorphic differences that
potentially confer resistance or susceptibility to glioma-
genesis. These modiﬁer loci could function by changing:
(1) the expression or function of genes important for glial
progenitor behaviour; (2) neuroﬁbromin growth regula-
tion; or (3) chemokine function or microglia activity,
which separately or collectively impact on glioma forma-
tion or growth. While the modiﬁer genes have yet to be
elucidated, genomic polymorphisms in these loci might
identify which children with NF1 are at highest risk for
the development of OPG. The identiﬁcation of single
nucleotide polymorphisms predictive of glioma risk would
positively impact on the management of children with
NF1, and would allow clinicians to stratify children
from an early age into clinically relevant subgroups for
surveillance and potential treatments.

Implications for paediatric
glioma-targeted therapies

The management approaches for PA in children currently
involve surgery and genotoxic chemotherapy. Surgical
resection is often a ﬁrst-line therapy for cerebellar and
hemispheric PAs, but is associated with signiﬁcant mor-
bidity when tumours are located in deeper structures
(brainstem) or in the optic pathway. For these tumours,
chemotherapy or radiotherapy is recommended. While
radiotherapy is curative, its use for paediatric glioma is
problematic, owing to the high incidence of cognitive
from
and neuroendocrine adverse effects that result

irradiating the developing brain. Moreover, radiation is
contraindicated in children with NF1; following brain
irradiation, there is an increased frequency of secondary
high-grade glioma and moyamoya disease [82,83].

Chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine is
usually well tolerated and achieves good disease control
[40,42,84]. However, antineoplastic drugs cause DNA
damage not only in cancer cells, but may also impact other
dividing cell populations in the developing brain. For this
reason, more targeted therapies are actively being sought
for this patient population.

With the availability of

robust preclinical mouse
models of Nf1 OPG, it becomes possible to identify and
evaluate alternative therapeutic strategies. Using Nf1
OPG mice, previous studies have shown that treatment
with a genotoxic alkylating agent, temozolomide, results
in decreased OPG volumes, reduced glioma proliferation
and increased glioma cell death [85]. These GEM strains
have subsequently been used to evaluate both neoplas-
tic and non-neoplastic cell-directed therapies. In this
regard, treatments that target the deregulated RAS/
mTOR [85] and cyclic AMP [77] signalling pathways
in the Nf1-deﬁcient astroglial cells reduce Nf1 OPG pro-
liferation. Similarly, therapies that inhibit non-neoplastic
microglia function also attenuate OPG growth in these
Nf1-mutant mice in vivo [72,75,76].

Another use of Nf1 genetically engineered mice is the
development of therapies that restore visual function. Pre-
vious studies have revealed that improvement in visual
function infrequently accompanies the successful chemo-
therapeutic treatment of NF1-associated glioma [41].
Insights into the cellular and molecular basis for optic
nerve dysfunction have been partly revealed by the analy-
sis of Nf1 OPG mice. In these studies, reduced visual
evoked potentials are seen early during tumour develop-
ment and are associated with axonal damage and retinal
ganglion cell death [86,87]. Nf1+/- neurones exhibit
increased apoptosis, which reﬂects reduced levels of intra-
cellular cAMP [88]. Raising cAMP levels with the PDE4
inhibitor (Rolipram) during tumour formation resulted in
reduced retinal ganglion cell apoptosis [88], suggesting a
potential neuroprotective adjuvant strategy for managing
OPGs in children with NF1.

unprecedented opportunities to develop personalized
treatments for children with low-grade gliomas. It is
possible that future therapies will incorporate genetic/
genomic diagnostics to identify patients at high risk for
glioma development and progression, as well as speciﬁc
glioma subtypes most likely to respond to targeted thera-
pies. Similarly, the use of robust low-grade glioma GEM
strains facilitates the identiﬁcation of treatments with
efﬁcacy against particular molecular subgroups of paedi-
atric low-grade glioma. These next-generation treatments
might target speciﬁc cell types or gliomagens in the
tumour microenvironment in combination with standard
or biologically based antineoplastic therapies. This ecosys-
tems approach could reduce the toxicity of current treat-
ments on the developing brains of children. Finally, the
use of adjuvant neuroprotective strategies has the poten-
tial to decrease secondary neurocognitive declines and
partially restore vision in affected children.
