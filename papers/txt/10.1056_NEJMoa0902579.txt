Background
Profound hearing loss is a serious complication of neurofibromatosis type 2, a ge-
netic condition associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, benign tumors 
that arise from the eighth cranial nerve. There is no medical treatment for such 
tumors.

Methods
We determined the expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
and three of its receptors, VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, and neuropilin-2, in paraffin-
embedded samples from 21 vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibro-
matosis type 2 and from 22 sporadic schwannomas. Ten consecutive patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas who were not 
candidates for standard treatment were treated with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF 
monoclonal antibody. An imaging response was defined as a decrease of at least 
20% in tumor volume, as compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined 
as a significant increase in the word-recognition score, as compared with baseline.

Results
VEGF was expressed in 100% of vestibular schwannomas and VEGFR-2 in 32% of 
tumor vessels on immunohistochemical analysis. Before treatment, the median an-
nual volumetric growth rate for 10 index tumors was 62%. After bevacizumab treat-
ment in the 10 patients, tumors shrank in 9 patients, and 6 patients had an imaging 
response, which was maintained in 4 patients during 11 to 16 months of follow-up. 
The median best response to treatment was a volumetric reduction of 26%. Three 
patients were not eligible for a hearing response; of the remaining seven patients, 
four had a hearing response, two had stable hearing, and one had progressive hear-
ing loss. There were 21 adverse events of grade 1 or 2.

Conclusions
VEGF blockade with bevacizumab improved hearing in some, but not all, patients 
with neurofibromatosis type 2 and was associated with a reduction in the volume 
of most growing vestibular schwannomas.

treated with bevacizumab. We chose this agent 
on  the  basis  of  tumor  immunohistochemical 
analyses  suggesting  a  potential  pathophysio-
logical role for the VEGF pathway in vestibular 
schwannomas. We provide radiologic and audio-
logic evidence that bevacizumab treatment of-
fered durable clinical benefit to some patients, 
including a reduction in tumor volume and an 
improvement in chronic hearing loss.

Methods

Immunohistochemical Analyses
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 21 schwan-
nomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, 
22 sporadic schwannomas, and 9 normal spinal-
nerve roots were immunostained with the follow-
ing antibodies: CD31, VEGF, VEGFR-2, platelet-
derived  growth  factor  receptor  α  (PDGFR-α), 
PDGFR-β, neuropilin-1, neuropilin-2, semaphorin 
3A, and semaphorin 3F. Semiquantitative analy-
sis was performed by two authors, who scored 
the intensity of tumor-cell and blood-vessel stain-
ing on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong 
staining).  A  customized  software  analysis  tool 
was  used  to  determine  the  number  of  vessels, 
perimeter, the minor axis of best fitted ellipse 
(representative of vessel diameter), and the total 
surface  covered  by  vascular  spaces.  The  same 
method was used, with the substitution of either 
VEGFR-2 or neuropilin-2 labeling, to determine 
the proportion of vessels expressing these VEGF 
receptors (for details, see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org).

Selection of Patients
We offered bevacizumab on a compassionate-use 
basis to patients who fulfilled the clinical diag-
nostic  criteria  for  neurofibromatosis  type  2,16 
had  evidence  of  progressive  vestibular  schwan-
nomas, and were considered poor candidates for 
surgery and radiation therapy or declined these 
treatments. Consecutive patients who met these 
criteria and had received at least one bevacizu-
mab dose as of August 1, 2008, were included in 
the analysis.

Clinical Evaluations
The intervals for clinical evaluations were deter-
mined before treatment of the first patient. Base-

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a domi-

nantly inherited genetic condition with a 
birth prevalence of 1 in 25,000.1 Bilateral 
vestibular schwannomas (also known as acoustic 
neuromas), which are benign tumors composed 
of neoplastic Schwann cells that arise from the 
eighth cranial nerve, are the hallmark of neuro-
fibromatosis 2. These tumors cause progressive 
hearing loss in most patients with neurofibroma-
tosis type 2, who commonly lose all functional 
hearing during early adulthood or middle age. 
Standard therapy for growing sporadic, unilateral 
vestibular schwannomas includes surgical remov-
al or radiation therapy. Both treatments usually 
achieve tumor control, but at the frequent cost of 
hearing loss in the affected ear.2,3

Treatment options are limited for patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 2 and a growing vestibu-
lar schwannoma ipsilateral to the only ear with 
hearing. Results of surgery and radiation ther-
apy for vestibular schwannomas associated with 
neurofibromatosis  type  2  are  worse  than  for 
sporadic tumors, because rates of tumor control 
are reduced and iatrogenic hearing loss is more 
frequent.4-6  Although  the  morbidity  of  active 
treatment can be prohibitively high, the conse-
quences of unchecked tumor growth (including 
progressive brain-stem compression) are also se-
vere. Currently, no medical treatments for tumors 
associated  with  neurofibromatosis  type  2  are 
available, and a safe and effective treatment for 
these patients is needed.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a 
critical mediator of tumor angiogenesis and ves-
sel permeability.7-9 VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-1 
have  been  detected  in  schwannomas,  and  in-
creased  levels  of  these  factors  correlate  with 
increased rates of tumor growth.10-14 Although 
schwannomas are not considered vascular tumors, 
the non–VEGF-related, antiangiogenic compound 
AGM-1470 inhibits angiogenesis and reduces the 
growth of nerve-sheath tumors in mouse mod-
els.15  The  VEGF-neutralizing  antibody  bevacizu-
mab has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for use in the treatment of can-
cers, but no studies have been performed in pa-
tients with neurofibromatosis type 2 or vestibu-
lar schwannomas.

Here we describe a retrospective study of 10 
consecutive patients with neurofibromatosis type 
2 and growing vestibular schwannomas who were

line magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and au-
diology were performed within 1 month before 
starting treatment. Clinical evaluation, which in-
cluded a physical examination, complete blood 
count, blood chemical analysis, and urinalysis, 
was performed every 2 to 4 weeks during treat-
ment. Tumor response was monitored with the 
use  of  serial  MRI  scanning  at  clinical  visits  at 
months 1, 3, and 6 and every 3 months thereaf-
ter. Tumor volumetric analysis was performed as 
described  previously.17  To  investigate  whether 
tumor shrinkage might be related, in part, to a 
decrease in intratumoral vasogenic edema, we sub-
sequently determined the mean apparent diffu-
sion coefficient (a measure of the magnitude of 
diffusion of water molecules within tissue and a 
marker of edema on imaging with MRI18) with-
in vestibular schwannomas at baseline. Dynam-
ic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was per-
formed in Patient 6 to evaluate changes in blood 
flow and vascular permeability after treatment.18 
Hearing response was monitored with the use of 
serial audiologic evaluations, including determi-
nation of pure-tone thresholds and word-recog-
nition scores (for details, see the Supplementary 
Appen dix).19,20 Data regarding toxic effects were 
collected  monthly  during  routine  clinic  visits, 
and adverse events were scored according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 3.0.

Definitions of imaging and Hearing 
Responses
We established definitions of imaging and hear-
ing responses after noting a clinical benefit in 
the first patient. An imaging response was de-
fined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor vol-
ume, as compared with the pretreatment base-
line.21 Volumetric changes of 15% or 20% have 
been used to define response and progression in 
early-phase trials involving patients with plexi-
form neurofibromas associated with neurofibro-
matosis type 1.22,23

A hearing response was defined as a signifi-
cant increase in the word-recognition score, as 
compared  with  the  baseline  score.24  Patients 
were eligible for a hearing response if their pre-
treatment  word-recognition  score  allowed  for 
hearing improvement above the upper limit of 
the  critical-difference  threshold  (i.e.,  a  word-
recognition score of 94% or less). Patients with 

surgically  disrupted  auditory  nerves  were  not 
eligible for a hearing response. We used pub-
lished guidelines25 to determine significant dif-
ferences between word-recognition scores to com-
pare  each  patient’s  scores  after  treatment  with 
baseline values.

Study Oversight
The institutional review board at Massachusetts 
General Hospital approved the retrospective chart 
review and tumor-specimen collections. All pa-
tients  provided  written  informed  consent  for 
treatment. The authors vouch for the complete-
ness and veracity of the data and data analyses. 
Bevacizumab  was  provided  as  part  of  clinical 
care; Genentech, the maker of bevacizumab, had 
no role in the study.

Statistical Analysis
For analyses of morphologic features, microvas-
cular density, and measures of diameter and pe-
rimeter, we used Bartlett’s test for the equality of 
multiple variances to analyze between-group dif-
ferences  in  variance.  Analysis-of-variance  esti-
mate  models  were  then  built  and  appropriate 
post hoc testing was performed on the basis of 
Bartlett’s test results. For measures with equal 
variances, Tukey’s test was used. For measures 
with unequal variances, the Games–Howell test 
was used. A P value of less than 0.05 was consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance.

R esults

Immunohistochemical Analyses
In normal peripheral nerves, the ligands VEGF, 
semaphorin 3A, semaphorin 3F, and the recep-
tors VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1 were consistently 
expressed in both Schwann cells and vascular 
endothelial  cells;  neuropilin-2  was  seen  in  all 
Schwann cells but in less than 5% of blood ves-
sels (Fig. 1A, and Fig. 1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In the schwannomas, tumor cells had 
expression  patterns  of  VEGF,  neuropilin-1,  and 
neuropilin-2 that were similar to those in normal 
nerve.  In  contrast,  VEGFR-2  was  expressed  in 
about half of all schwannomas, and semaphorin 
3A  and  semaphorin  3F  were  expressed  in  only 
20% of schwannomas and at reduced intensity 
(Fig. 1A and 1B, and Fig. 2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).

VEGFR-2 was found in 32% of vessels in tu-
mors associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 
and in sporadic tumors. In contrast, all vessels 
expressed neuropilin-1 (similar to normal nerve), 
and about 10% of vessels expressed neuropilin-2 
(Fig. 1C). Most tumor cells showed little or no 
expression of PDGFR-α or PDGFR-β. More than 
50% of tumor specimens expressed both PDGFR-α 
and PDGFR-β on the vascular endothelium, con-
sistent with an angiogenic phenotype (Fig. 3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

Morphometric analysis revealed that schwan-
nomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 
showed a greater microvascular density (22 ves-
sels  per  square  millimeter)  and  a  larger  vessel 
diameter (mean, 14.2 μm), and perimeter (mean, 
91 μm) than normal nerve (with 18 vessels per 
square millimeter and a mean vessel diameter of 
7.9 μm and perimeter of 47 μm) (Fig. 1D).

Patients
The baseline characteristics of the 10 patients in 
the study are shown in Table 1. All patients were 
poor  candidates  for  standard  treatment,  since 
eight were at high risk for complete hearing loss 
and one for bilateral lower cranial-nerve palsies, 
and one patient had declined surgery or radia-
tion. Patients 1 through 5 had been treated previ-
ously with erlotinib chemotherapy26 but stopped 
treatment because of either toxic effects (Patient 
1) or tumor growth (Patients 2 through 5).

Treatment
Six men and four women with a median age of 25 
years (range, 16 to 53) received intravenous beva-
cizumab at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body 
weight every 2 weeks. The median annual growth 
rate in tumor volume before treatment was 62% 
(range, 9 to 121). The median duration of treat-
ment was 12 months (range, 3 to 19), and six 
patients were followed for at least 1 year. Six pa-
tients continued to be treated with bevacizumab 
at the end of the study. Patient 1 stopped treat-
ment after 19 months because of slow growth of 
a  vestibular  schwannoma,  which  caused  brain-
stem compression; the tumor was subsequently 
resected.  Patient  5  discontinued  bevacizumab 
temporarily as she awaited surgical removal of a 
nonvestibular  schwannoma.  Patient  7  stopped 
bevacizumab after 3 months because of progres-
sive growth of a spinal meningioma; he died of 

complications after surgery to resect the tumor 
5 months later. Patient 8 stopped treatment after 
8 months because of progressive growth of a ves-
tibular schwannoma and hearing loss.

imaging Response
Of the 10 tumors, 9 shrank after bevacizumab 
treatment, and 6 had an imaging response (Ta-
ble 1, and Fig. 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The median best response to treatment was 26% 
shrinkage (range, 44% shrinkage to 32% growth). 
Of six tumors that had an objective imaging re-
sponse, the response was maintained in four tu-
mors at the last imaging follow-up 11 to 16 months 
after  the  initiation  of  treatment.  Three  tumors 
remained stable (i.e., ranging from a 19% reduc-
tion to a 19% increase in volumetric growth, as 
compared  with  baseline)  during  bevacizumab 
treatment, and one patient had an increase in 
tumor volume of 32%.

A  strong  correlation  was  observed  between 
the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at base-
line within tumors and the percent decrease in 
volume  at  3  months  (Pearson’s  r  correlation, 
−0.87; r 2 = 0.75; P = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). In the single 
patient with complete DCE-MRI data (Patient 6), 
a measure of blood flow and vascular permeabil-
ity decreased by 68%, tumor blood volume de-
creased by 77%, tumor blood flow decreased by 
51%, mean transit time decreased by 9%, and the 
average vessel size decreased by 70% at 3 months 
(Fig. 2B). Twelve months after the initiation of 
treatment, measures of blood flow and vascular 
permeability  continued  to  fall.  Although  the 
amount  of  gadolinium  enhancement  decreased 
over time, the enhancement pattern within ves-
tibular schwannomas did not change noticeably 
during treatment (Fig. 2C).

Hearing Response
Seven patients were considered eligible for a hear-
ing response. Of the other three patients, two had 
normal  hearing  ipsilateral  to  index  vestibular 
schwannomas  at  baseline  (and  thus  could  not 
improve), and one had undergone surgical resec-
tion of both auditory nerves. A hearing response 
was  observed  in  four  of  seven  eligible  patients 
(57%)  (Fig.  5  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix). 
The  hearing  benefit  of  bevacizumab  was  large 
for Patient 2, whose word-recognition score in-
creased from 8% to 98%, and for Patient 3, whose

Figure 1 (facing page). Angiogenic Profile of Vestibular 
Schwannomas.
Panel A shows immunohistochemical analysis of mem-
bers of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
pathway in normal peripheral nerve and schwannoma. 
In normal nerve, staining for VEGF highlights Schwann 
cells (arrows), and staining for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) 
highlights vessels (arrowheads). Staining for neuropilin-2 
(NRP-2) and semaphorin 3F (SEMA-3F) highlights 
Schwann cells in normal nerve. In schwannomas, VEGF 
staining highlights tumor cells (arrowhead) and blood 
vessels (arrow); VEGFR-2 staining highlights some ves-
sels (arrowheads), whereas others remain unstained (ar-
rows). Tumor cells stain diffusely for NRP-2 but not for 
SEMA-3F. In all panels, brown staining shows positivity 
for the given antigen, and blue labels the nuclei, with 
the letter A denoting axon, the letter M myelin, and the 
letter S Schwann cell. Panel B shows the percentage  
of samples with expression of more than 1 on a scale 
of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining) for the known 
members of the VEGF pathway (ligands and receptors). 
SEMA-3F and SEMA-3A are expressed in all nerve roots 
(3 intensity). In samples from patients with neurofibro-
matosis type 2 (NF2), 58% of the tumors have completely 
negative staining for SEMA-3F, and 22% are negative for 
SEMA-3A. In samples from patients with sporadic tumors, 
44% of tumors are negative for SEMA-3F, and 33% are 
negative for SEMA-3A. Since none of the samples were 
scored as 2 or 3, no bar is shown for SEMA-3A. Panel C 
shows the quantification of the number of vessels per 
square millimeter expressing VEGFR-2 and NRP-2 in 
vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibroma-
tosis type 2 and sporadic vestibular schwannomas. CD31 
was used to count the total number of vessels per square 
millimeter. There were no significant differences between 
tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and 
sporadic tumors. Panel D shows statistical analysis of 
the morphometric measures. Diameter, perimeter, and 
microvascular density were all significantly smaller for 
the 470 vessels analyzed in normal peripheral nerve 
roots than in either schwannomas associated with neu-
rofibromatosis type 2 (1215 vessels from 20 patients) or 
sporadic schwannomas (2104 vessels from 17 patients). 
The perimeters (or surface area, data not shown) were 
significantly larger in tumors associated with neurofi-
bromatosis type 2 than in sporadic tumors.

had a hearing response, the result was durable 
for 11 to 16 months.

Of the three patients who did not have a hear-
ing response, Patient 1 had had no word recog-
nition  for  at  least  8  months  before  treatment, 
Patient 8 had a decline in word recognition (44% 
to  16%)  after  starting  treatment  despite  initial 
tumor shrinkage, and Patient 10 had stable hear-
ing  despite  a  sustained  reduction  in  tumor  vol-
ume. Although Patient 1 did not have a hearing or 
an imaging response, he had clinical improve-

ment that may have been related to treatment. 
Before treatment, he was receiving hospice care 
because  of  intractable  headache  and  vomiting 
associated with critical brain-stem compression. 
Within 4 weeks after starting therapy, his head-
aches and vomiting resolved, and he returned to 
high school. He remained clinically improved for 
19 months of treatment but then required resec-
tion  of  his  vestibular  schwannoma  for  tumor 
growth. Four of five patients reported subjective 
improvement in baseline tinnitus, and one noted 
no change.

Adverse Effects
A total of 21 grade 1 or 2 adverse events were 
reported, including increased levels of aspartate 
aminotransferase (4 events) and alanine amino-
transferase (3 events), proteinuria (3 events), hyper-
tension (2 events), delayed wound healing (2 events), 
hyperkalemia (2 events), hyperbilirubinemia (2 
events), uterine bleeding (1 event), hypocalcemia 
(1 event), hypophosphatemia (1 event), and hypo-
magnesemia (1 event). Two patients had infected 
vascular access ports requiring removal. In this 
small sample of patients, no patients had throm-
boembolic events, hemorrhage, congestive heart 
failure, gastrointestinal perforation, or reversible 
posterior  leukoencephalopathy.  No  patient  dis-
continued treatment because of adverse events, 
and no grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported.

Discussion

Our study showed that bevacizumab treatment 
was  followed  by  clinically  meaningful  hearing 
improvement, tumor-volume reduction, or both in 
some, but not all, patients with neurofibromato-
sis type 2 who were at risk for complete hearing 
loss or brain-stem compression from growing 
vestibular schwannomas. Our findings confirm 
that VEGF is produced by schwannoma tumor 
cells10-14 and suggests that this growth factor 
may participate in tumor growth and hearing loss 
associated  with  vestibular  schwannomas.  The 
imaging findings indicate that the mean apparent 
diffusion coefficient at baseline might be a po-
tential  marker  for  volumetric  response  to  anti-
VEGF therapy. The DCE-MRI data, though limit-
ed, further suggest that bevacizumab normalizes 
the function of tumor vessels and potentially re-
stores a more normal blood–nerve barrier.

These findings have implications for patients

C Imaging Response in Patient 2

Figure 2. Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) Measures during Treatment with Bevacizumab.
Panel A shows the correlation between mean apparent 
diffusion coefficients (ADCs) at baseline and subse-
quent changes in tumor volume for the 10 patients after 
3 months of treatment with bevacizumab. Panel B shows 
dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs of Patient 6, with mea-
sures of blood flow and vascular permeability indicat-
ing the permeability of vestibular schwannomas (with 
the most permeable areas shown in white and the least 
permeable areas in dark red). At baseline, permeability 
is high for both tumors but decreases progressively 
during 12 months of treatment, as shown by the values 
beneath the images. Panel C shows representative cra-
nial T1-weighted MRI scans of Patient 2 after the admin-
istration of contrast material at baseline (left) and after 
9 months of treatment (right). T2-weighted scans are 
also shown at the same time points. The overall decrease 
in tumor volume (30%) can be seen by comparing the 
tumor outline at baseline (yellow line) with the outline 
after 3 months of treatment with bevacizumab (red 
line). The enhancement pattern in vestibular schwan-
nomas did not change noticeably during treatment 
with bevacizumab.

with neurofibromatosis type 2 and for the study 
of vestibular schwannoma biology. First, the re-
duced expression of VEGFR-2 on tumor vessels 
suggested that interfering with the function of 
VEGF receptors might be less effective than tar-
geting VEGF directly, which prompted our choice 
of bevacizumab for treatment. Our data suggest 
that the current understanding of VEGF-mediat-
ed  angiogenesis  —  that  VEGF  is  secreted  by 
tumor  cells  and  then  binds  to  and  activates 
VEGFR-2  on  endothelial  cells  —  may  be  more 
complex  in  schwannomas,  in  which  vessels  ex-
press different VEGF receptors. Further work is 
needed  to  understand  the  role  of  the  sema-
phorin–neuropilin axis in these tumors.

Second, VEGF inhibition can lead to modest 
but relevant decreases in the volume of vestibu-
lar  schwannomas.  This  effect  is  notable,  given 
the lack of sensitivity of benign nervous-system 
tumors to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Third, 
in some patients, VEGF inhibition can lead to a 
relatively rapid (<12 weeks) improvement in hear-
ing, as reflected by word-recognition scores, with 
sustained improvement for up to 16 months. Ob-
servational studies have shown that word-recog-
nition scores deteriorate over time in patients 
with vestibular schwannomas and that signifi-
cant  improvement  is  not  expected.27  We  posit

that improvement is due to a reduction in intra-
neural edema, as well as tumor shrinkage. This 
assertion  is  supported  by  the  time  course  of 
hearing improvement, the correlation between 
the mean apparent diffusion coefficient and tu-
mor shrinkage, and the changes in intratumoral 
vascular permeability, as seen on DCE-MRI. This 
mechanism  is  consistent  with  the  vascular-
normalization hypothesis28 and previous studies 
of  anti-VEGF  therapy  in  malignant  brain  tu-
mors.18,29

To date, four of our six patients with an imag-
ing response and all four patients with a hearing 
response have continued to respond to therapy 
for 11 to 16 months. This suggests that response 
to anti-VEGF therapy can be durable for progres-
sive  vestibular  schwannomas  associated  with 
neurofibromatosis type 2. In contrast, the median 
time  to  progression  for  recurrent  glioblastoma 
treated with antiangiogenic therapy  is  about  16 
weeks.18,30  Patients  with  benign  tumors  who 
benefit from anti-VEGF therapy present unique 
clinical challenges: they may have prolonged sur-
vival  during  which  unanticipated  delayed  toxic 
effects could become manifest, and the implica-
tions of stopping therapy are unknown, with the 
potential for rebound tumor growth when mono-
clonal treatment is stopped.18

Although  the  need  for  an  effective  medical 
therapy for patients with neurofibromatosis type 
2 is clear, the risk of toxic effects deserves care-
ful consideration. In our preliminary experience, 
toxic effects were limited to grade 1 or 2 adverse 
events  during  follow-up  of  up  to  16  months, 
which is not long in comparison with the ex-
pected survival of these young patients. The ab-

sence of many common toxic effects of bevaci-
zumab in our patients may have reflected their 
relative youth, the lack of other medical condi-
tions,  and  the  small  number  of  patients  who 
were treated.

Our results show an interesting biologic effect 
of bevacizumab treatment on vestibular schwan-
nomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. 
However, we treated only patients with neurofi-
bromatosis type 2 who were at imminent risk for 
severe  neurologic  consequences  and  not  those 
with  less  advanced  symptoms  or  patients  with 
sporadic vestibular schwannomas. Additional re-
search will be necessary to determine the opti-
mal drug regimen, duration, and adverse-effect 
profile for long-term anti-VEGF therapy for ves-
tibular schwannomas associated with neurofibro-
matosis type 2.
