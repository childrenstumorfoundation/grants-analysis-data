Abstract Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common
autosomal dominant single-gene disorder, in which the
co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has
attracted considerable research interest
recently with
prevalence estimates of 21–40 %. However, detailed
characterization of the ASD behavioral phenotype in NF1
is still lacking. This study characterized the phenotypic
proﬁle of ASD symptomatology presenting in 4–16 year
old children with NF1 (n = 36) using evidence from
parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale and researcher
autism diagnostic observation Scale-2. Compared to IQ-
matched reference groups of children with autism and
ASD,
the NF1 proﬁle shows overall similarity but
improved eye contact, less repetitive behaviors and better
language skills.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurode-
velopmental disorder with a population prevalence of about
1 % (Baird et al. 2006). It is behaviorally deﬁned and
diagnosed, characterized by deﬁcits in the clinical dyad of
social communication and interaction along with restricted
and repetitive behaviors and interests. It is highly heritable
with monozygotic twin concordance rates of about
60–90 %. Over the last three decades, concerted research
efforts into the etiology of ASD have found striking genetic
heterogeneity, with a large number of highly penetrant de
novo germline mutations and rare inherited ASD variations
distributed acro
ss many genes (Pinto et al. 2014). Alongside this, there is
wide variation in the phenotypic presentation, not only in
the pattern and severity of symptoms but also in the
occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities.

The considerable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity
has been a limiting factor in furthering our insights into
causal mechanisms in autism and in the search for targeted

interventions. Two parallel approaches have been used to
reduce this heterogeneity. One approach, which has proved
useful, has been to subset the ASD sample according to
speciﬁc phenotypes; by sex of proband, language, or using
behavioral features such as autistic regression (Abrahams
and Geschwind 2008). The other has been to study
behavioral proﬁles of genetically homogenous groups,
which manifest ASD symptoms at higher than expected
frequencies compared to the general population. This so-
called ‘syndromic autism’ accounts for approximately
10–20 % of all ASD cases (Geschwind 2011). Examples
include Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, Cornelia de Lange
syndrome, Timothy syndrome, Angelman’s syndrome—all
of which have a documented high prevalence of ASD
(Oliver et al. 2011).

Recently, there has been considerable research interest
in the co-occurrence of ASD in another single gene dis-
order, Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a common
autosomal dominant single-gene disorder caused by a
mutation in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17q11.2.
It has an estimated birth incidence of one in 2,700 and
prevalence of one in 4,560 (Evans et al. 2010). NF1 is
clinically diagnosed based on the presence of distinctive
cutaneous features such as cafe´-au-lait spots, skin-fold
freckling and neuroﬁbromas. It is a clinically heteroge-
neous disorder with marked inter and intra-familial vari-
ability. Genotype phenotype correlation studies have
largely failed to explain the phenotypic variability; 5 % of
the NF1 (Table 1) gene mutations are microdeletions
which are linked to a more severe clinical phenotype
including dysmorphic features,
impairment,
cardiovascular malformations and a higher burden of
benign and malignant tumours (Mautner et al. 2010).

intellectual

The commonest associated complication of NF1 in
childhood relates to cognitive dysfunction. Mean intelli-
gence quotient scores of children with NF1 fall within the
average range; nevertheless, approximately 70 % of

children
cognitive-
behavioral phenotype of NF1 is characterized by speciﬁc
learning difﬁculties, neuropsychological deﬁcits, attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and social, emo-
tional and behavioral problems (Lehtonen et al. 2013).
ADHD is most commonly reported with prevalence esti-
mates ranging from 30–67 % (Coude et al. 2007).

The co-occurrence of ASD in NF1 was ﬁrst noted over
three decades ago; Gillberg and Forsell 1984 reported
simultaneous occurrence of NF1 in three out of 51 children
with infantile autism in the community. A retrospective case
note analysis of 341 children with infantile autism seen at
child psychiatry clinics over a 25 year period found only one
case of co-occurrence of NF1 and autism (Mouridsen et al.
1992). Similarly Fombonne et al. (1997) conducted an epi-
demiological survey among 300,000 children and found
NF1 in 0.6 % of children with autism. Published literature
over the last 10 years has described social and communi-
cation impairments in the NF1 population but without
integrating this within an ASD syndromic framework. Bar-
ton and North (2004) found children with NF1 had signiﬁ-
cantly poorer
social outcomes as compared to their
unaffected siblings with the presence of ADHD as an
important mediator of social functioning. Noll et al. (2007)
found that children with NF1 were perceived as having more
social problems by parent, teachers and classroom peers.
Huijbregts et al. (2010) found that as compared to controls,
children with NF1 have problems in social information
processing, perform poorly on tasks such as identiﬁcation
and matching facial emotions and have signiﬁcant parent
reported autistic symptomatology. In a two phase population
based epidemiological study (n = 109) with gold standard
assessment
instruments of autism diagnostic inventory-
revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Sche-
dule (ADOS), Garg et al. (2013) demonstrated prevalence
estimates of 25 % ASD in NF1 with a further 21 % broader
ASD phenotype. In a retrospective, cross-sectional design

(n = 66), with parent-reported measures, Walsh et al.
(2013) suggested 40 % prevalence of ASD symptomatol-
ogy. In a hospital-based NF1 pediatric population (n = 82)
using the children’s social behavior questionnaire (CSBQ)
and social responsiveness scale (SRS), Plasschaert et al.
(2014) found a high prevalence of ASD characteristics, more
frequently reported above the age of 8 years. Replicating the
previous studies, a prevalence estimate of 26 % was repor-
ted by extensive diagnostic ASD assessment in a subgroup
of these children, clinically selected based on parental
concerns and observations by a multidisciplinary team.
Item-level analyses suggested that these NF1 ? ASD chil-
dren may have a distinctive social behavioral proﬁle com-
pared to general ASD.

It is well known that the prevalence of ASD rises with the
severity of intellectual impairment. Indeed Skuse (2007)
suggests that intellectual impairment rather than any other
syndrome-speciﬁc cause largely explains the increased autism
prevalence in genetic syndromes. Disorders such as Cornelia
de Lange and Angelman’s syndrome are associated with
severe intellectual impairment (Deardorf et al. 2005). By
contrast in NF1, the mean IQ of children is within the average
range, which suggests that this is a true co-occurrence and
intellectual impairment alone fails to explain the increased
prevalence rates. NF1 has a well-described neurobiology
explaining the cognitive phenotype (Diggs-Andrews and
Gutmann 2013). The loss of neuroﬁbromin in NF1 is associ-
ated with increased rat sarcoma (Ras)/MAPK (mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase) signaling impairing synaptic plasticity
leading to the cognitive phenotype (Costa et al. 2002). A
number of putative interventions such as statins (Krab et al.
2008; Acosta et al. 2011; van der Vaart et al. 2013) and cal-
cium channel blockers (Kallarackal et al. 2013) have been
studied in the NF1 mouse model capable of reversing the
cognitive phenotype. Evidence is also emerging implicating
the Ras/MAPK pathway as being important in the etiology of
ASD. Recently Pinto et al. (2014) showed that genes most
affected by copy number variations (CNVs) and single
nucleotide variations (SNVs) converge on three neural system
functional networks including the MAPK signaling pathway.
Adviento et al. (2014) have shown increase prevalence of
autism traits in the disorders on the Ras/MAPK pathway
(collectively known as the Rasopathies).

NF1 may thus be highly rewarding to study in the
context of ASD; however detailed characterization of the
ASD behavioral phenotype is lacking. We also need to
understand how the NF1 mutation inﬂuences the ASD
phenotypic presentation on the core domains; whether the
diagnosis is driven by extreme scores in any particular
domain. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study to thus
characterize the NF1 ? ASD phenotype. The aim of this
study is twofold: characterize the ASD proﬁle in NF1 and
to compare it to idiopathic ASD.

Methodology

Recruitment

For the current study, participant data were collected from
the Regional genetics service at Central Manchester Uni-
versity Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust
in the United
Kingdom and the Center of Human Genetics, University
Hospital of Leuven in Belgium. Participant data were
gathered from existing databases with the following
inclusion criteria (1) Meeting the ASD cut-off on the social
responsiveness scale (T scores C60) (2) Scoring above
ASD cut-off score of the autism diagnostic observation
schedule–second edition (ADOS-2) module 3 (overall total
of social affect and restricted and repetitive behaviors C7).
NF1 diagnosis was made clinically using the National
institutes of health (NIH) diagnostic criteria (National
Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference
1988).
For

the Manchester group, NF1 children aged
4–18 years were originally recruited and assessed for ASD
as part of two independent studies: an earlier published
epidemiological study of ASD prevalence in NF1(Garg
et al. 2013) and an ongoing randomized controlled trial of
Simvastatin in children with NF1 ? ASD. For the Leuven
group, NF1 children aged 5–17 years were recruited from
the NF1 clinic and assessed for ASD on the basis of clinical
suspicion and/or parental concerns (Plasschaert et al.
2014).

Participants

In this study, a total of 36 children with NF1 ? ASD met
the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the sample was
11.09 years (SD 3.19, range 4.6–16.1 years) and the sam-
ple consisted of 27 boys (75 %) and 9 girls (25 %).
Familial (50 %) and de novo (47 %) NF1 cases were
equally divided in the NF1 ? ASD group, with the manner
of inheritance in one child remaining unknown, since this
child was adopted. All children were administered with the
Weschsler’s Abbreviated Scales for Intelligence (WASI)
(Wechsler 2004) and vocabulary and similarities subtest
were used to present the level of verbal intellectual abili-
ties. Their mean verbal IQ (VIQ) was 94.00 (SD 14.60,
range 64.0–126.0).

For the SRS, standardized T-scores on the total problem
scale and the different subdomains are reported. When
analyzing ADOS scores, NF1 ? ASD children were
compared to normative data of children with autism
(n = 129) and children with ASD (n = 83), as reported in
the ADOS-2 manual (Lord et al. 2012). No statistically
signiﬁcant difference was observed in the sex ratio or the
VIQ of the NF1 ? ASD group compared to the autism and

ism (v2 (1) = 1.43, p = .23 and NF1 ? ASD/ASD (v2
(1) = 0.04, p = .84). The NF1 sample was signiﬁcantly
older (NF1 ? ASD/autism: t (212) = 6.27, p \ .01 and
NF1 ? ASD/ASD: t (284) = 5.45, p \ .01).

Measures

The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Constantino et al.
2003) for children and adolescents aged 4–18 years, is a
normed 65-item rating scale developed to screen for a wide
range of behaviours characteristic of ASD. The scale is
completed by parents rating the social interactions of their
child in their naturalistic social context(s). Ratings are
given by frequency of occurrence on a scale from 1 (not
true) to 4 (almost always true). The SRS generates a total
problem score, describing the severity of social deﬁcits in
the autism spectrum, while also generating ﬁve subscale
score assessing social awareness, social cognition (infor-
social communication,
mation processing),
social motivation (anxiety/avoidance), and autistic man-
nerisms (preoccupations and traits). Higher scores on the
SRS indicate greater severity of social impairment.

reciprocal

The Autism diagnostic observation schedule–second
edition (ADOS-2) (Lord et al. 2012) is a semi-structured,
standardized observational assessment of communication,
social interaction, play and imaginative skills, and repeti-
tive behaviors. It consists of 4 modules appropriate to
different developmental age and expressive language skills.
In the current study, only NF1 ? ASD children assessed
with the ADOS Module 3 were included, since this was the
only group with a reliable sample size (n = 36). Thirty
NF1 ? ASD children were measured with the ADOS.
These observations were scored according to ADOS-2
algorithms. Since item ‘Amount of social overtures‘ was
only scored when using ADOS-2 observations (n = 6), it
was excluded from the analyses. Module 3 is intended for
verbally ﬂuent children and young adolescents. Verbal
ﬂuency was deﬁned as ‘producing a range of sentence
types and grammatical forms, using language to provide
information about events out of the context of the ADOS,
and producing some logical connections within sentences’.
In the current study, item, algorithm and comparison scores
will be used. Scores on individual items range from 0 (no
evident abnormality) to 3 (marked abnormality) in domains
of social communication, social interaction, imagination
and restricted, repetitive behaviors.

Thresholds consistent with ASD diagnosis are obtained
from an overall total algorithm score, which is the sum-
mation of
social

interaction and social communication scores) and repetitive
and restricted behavior (RRB) algorithm scores. These
scores are compared with cut-off scores to provide one of
three classiﬁcations: autism, autism spectrum, and non-
spectrum. The difference between autism and autism
spectrum classiﬁcations is one of severity, with the former
indicating more pronounced symptoms.

A comparison score, which is a continuous metric
ranging from 1 to 10, allows to compare a child’s overall
level of ASD symptoms to that of ASD children with the
same age and similar language skills. Consequently, it can
be expressed as one of four descriptive categories—from
‘no evidence of autism spectrum-related symptoms’ to ‘a
high level of autism spectrum-related symptoms’.

Procedure

The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the
University Hospital of Leuven (ML8552-S54631) and the
Greater Manchester West & Central Manchester Ethics
committees (REC 11/NW/0838 and 13/NW/0111). The
SRS was completed by the parent or primary caregiver.
ADOS-2 assessments were video-recorded, administered
by trained researchers and scored immediately after
administration.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed in SPSS version 17 and Sigmastat
version 4.0. Demographic and clinical characteristics of
participants were compared with norm groups by using
2-sample t tests and v2 tests. Categorical data are presented
as percentages (frequency) and compared by using the v2
test. To compare ADOS item and algorithm scores, the
effect of group (NF1 vs. TD and NF1 vs. ASD) was
investigated. An ANOVA test was applied, with Tukey–
Kramer correction for post hoc tests. A p value of \0.05
was considered signiﬁcant.

We also looked at the differences at the data according
to study centers (Leuven or Manchester). No signiﬁcant
differences were observed in the SRS data. For the ADOS
Total
score, a marginally signiﬁcant difference was
observed between study groups (p = .055), with the
Manchester group having higher average scores than the
Leuven group. Having a closer look at ADOS domain
scores, this was caused by signiﬁcantly average higher
scores in the Manchester group for
the SA domain
(p = .007). On item level, signiﬁcant differences were
found on few algorithm items: A5 (offers information;
p = .020), B1 (eye contact; p = .001), B2 (facial expres-
sions; p = .025) for which the scores were overall higher
in the Manchester group than in the Leuven group.

Results

SRS Questionnaire

The mean SRS total problem T-score of the NF1 sample
was 78.58 (SD 11.37, range 60–107). Forty-four percent of
this group presented with mild to moderate problems with
T-scores ranging from 60 to 75, while another 56 % had
severe problems with T-scores reaching 76 or higher. On
the SRS subscales, the mean T-scores were as follows:
social awareness 68.89 (SD 15.50), social cognition 76.22
(SD 13.20), social communication 76.47 (SD 13.10), social
motivation 73.78 (SD 13.41) and autistic mannerisms 79.08
(SD 12.66). A signiﬁcant negative correlation was found
between VIQ and the SRS total T-score (r = -553;
p = .001). The distribution of SRS subscale scores is
shown in Fig. 1.

ADOS-2 Comparison and Algorithm Domain Scores

As based on selection criteria, all children met ASD cut-off
scores on ADOS-2. In terms of severity using the ADOS-2
comparison scores, 11 % (n = 4) had a low level of autism
spectrum symptoms, 66 % (n = 24) had moderate symp-
toms and 23 % (n = 8) had a high level of symptoms.

Mean ADOS-2 algorithm domain scores are presented
in Table 2. There were statistically signiﬁcant group dif-
ferences in the SA domain across the three groups with
scores being the highest for the autism group, followed by
scores of the NF1 group and ASD group (F (2,348) = 40.5,
p \ .001). Statistically signiﬁcant group differences were
also present on the restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB)
domain with the NF1 group showing the lowest scores as

0.43) followed by the NF1 group (mean 11.11, SD 0.61)
and the ASD group (mean 9.34, SD 0.32). No signiﬁcant
correlations were found between VIQ and ADOS domain
scores (all p [ .05).

ADOS-2 Algorithm Item Scores

Algorithm item scores are also shown in Table 2. On the
SA algorithm items, there were no signiﬁcant differences
between the NF1 ? ASD group and the autism group apart
from unusual eye contact which was worse in the autism
group. On all of the RRB items, NF1 ? ASD children had
signiﬁcantly lower scores compared to autism children.

The NF1 ? ASD group in comparison to the ASD
group was more impaired on the SA algorithm items for
language and communication items including conversation
and use of gestures and reciprocal social interaction items
including facial expressions directed to examiner, shared
enjoyment
in interaction, quality of social overtures,
quality of social responses, amount of reciprocal social
communication and overall quality of report. In contrast,
the ASD group was signiﬁcantly more likely to have poor
eye contact. A borderline signiﬁcant trend was found for
‘reporting of events’, with more problems observed in NF1
children compared to ASD children. On the RRB algorithm
items, no signiﬁcant differences were found between
NF1 ? ASD and ASD children, except
the item
assessing the use of stereotyped words/phrases, which was
signiﬁcantly more impaired in ASD children.

ADOS-2 Non-Algorithm Item Scores

Non-algorithm item scores are presented in Table 3. On the
non-algorithm items, the NF1 group was less impaired
compared to autism children for language and communi-
cation items related to overall level of non-echoed lan-
guage, speech abnormalities associated with autism and
echolalia. However, they were equally impaired for items
assessing offering and asking for information. Nonetheless,
for this latter item, the difference was borderline signiﬁ-
cant. Similarly on reciprocal social
interaction items,
NF1 ? ASD children were less impaired than autism
group on items concerning language production and linked
non-verbal communication, comments on others emotion/
empathy and insight
into typical social situations and
relationships. No statistical differences were found in
imagination/creativity across the two groups. On RRB non-
algorithm items, NF1 ? ASD children were signiﬁcantly
less impaired to the autism group on presence of compul-
sions/rituals.

When comparing NF1 ? ASD to ASD children, statis-
tical differences were found in only two language and

ADOS-2. Although these two sub-types of idiopathic aut-
ism have now been combined within the current DSM 5
criteria (American Psychiatric Association 2013), this dual
comparison is pragmatic and being based on currently
available systematic data, is also useful in being able to
make a comparison with different severities of idiopathic
ASD.

Reviewing the algorithm data in the light of these
comparisons we ﬁnd ASD symptoms were evaluated as
moderate in most assessed NF1 ? ASD children (66 %).
Generally the symptom proﬁle shows similarity between
NF1 and the ASD/autism groups. However overall differ-
ences are apparent in some areas; these include, compar-
atively in NF1, overall
less
repetitive behaviors and better language skills.

improved eye contact,

Overall the results suggest that on the SA domains,
NF1 ? ASD children are just as impaired as the idiopathic
autism group and more impaired compared to the ASD
group. The NF1 ? ASD group uses eye contact signiﬁ-
cantly more than either of the two comparison groups.

observed difﬁculties in communication and interaction;
[90 % have clinically relevant difﬁculties in interpreting
social cues in interactions (cognition), while also having
troubles with social communication. Also, social motiva-
tion was impaired in about 80 %. Sixty percent had prob-
lems in picking up on social cues (awareness).

Our

results also show that using the ADOS,

the
NF1 ? ASD group is statistically less likely to score on
RRBs as compared to the autism group, however having
comparable scores to the ASD group. Curiously though,
parent ratings on the autistic mannerisms subscales of the
SRS questionnaire were very high with two-third of
NF1 ? ASD children scoring in the severe problem range.
Other studies which have used the SRS questionnaire to
measure autistic symptomatology in the NF1 population
have similarly found elevated scores on the ‘autistic man-
nerisms’ domain This subscale measures problems with
ﬂexibility, repetitive behaviors and being regarded by
others as ‘odd’. This apparent discrepancy between parent-
rated (SRS) and clinician-rated child observational mea-
sures (ADOS) suggests that the RRBs are qualitatively

different or not as severe as in idiopathic autism such that
they are not being picked up within the ADOS assessment
context. The ADOS is a short clinical interaction/obser-
vational measure lasting 30–40 min which may not be
enough to observe repetitive behaviors (Rudacille 2011).
The NF1 ? ASD sample was signiﬁcantly older than the
reference groups. But this is unlikely to offer a plausible
explanation for the fewer observed RRBs as there is good
reported stability of core ASD traits in children across
diverse ages. Indeed, Gotham et al. (2012) have shown the
relative stability of ADOS standardized scores over
8–12 years. Or if RRBs are truly absent, does the new
DSM 5 diagnosis of ‘social pragmatic communication
disorder’ more accurately describe the social impairment in
the NF1 group? (American Psychiatric Association 2013).
On non-algorithm ADOS domains of imagination/crea-
tivity and other abnormal behaviors, some speciﬁc ﬁndings
should be underlined. On the items measuring imagination/
creativity, NF1 ? ASD children are just as impaired as the
autism group and signiﬁcantly more impaired than ASD
children. Additionally, no group differences were found in

123

item measuring overactivity, which is an interesting ﬁnding
since ADHD prevalence estimates in NF1 range from
30–67 %. This was perhaps unsurprising since high levels
of comorbidity with ADHD are also observed in idiopathic
ASD (Simonoff et al. 2008). There was also no evidence of
group differences in the item measuring anxiety which is
also a feature of some genetic disorders such as fragile X
(Rogers et al. 2001) and Cornelia de Lange syndrome
(Moss et al. 2012).

it

Based on our study,

is possible that with fewer
observed RRB’s and better eye contact these children do
not present in clinic as idiopathic ASD and hence more
likely to be overlooked by clinicians. Further research
should look into detail at social cognition in NF1 including,
theory of mind and affect recognition and explore RRBs
using detailed parental
interview such as the Autism
Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) and observational
measures. Understanding differences in children with
NF1 ? ASD and NF1 without ASD will also be important
in furthering our understanding of the neurobiology of
autism spectrum disorders.

Phenotypic proﬁles of syndromic ASD have been
reported in other genetic disorders such as Fragile X,
Williams syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, Down syndrome,
Angelman syndrome and Rett syndrome. Speciﬁcity in
proﬁles is often striking and intriguing in relation to our
ﬁndings in NF1. For example, Fragile X presents with gaze
aversion, stereotypic and repetitive speech, Williams syn-
drome presents with poor shared enjoyment in interaction
and impaired non-verbal communication (Tordjman et al.
2012), excessive sociability in Angelman’s syndrome
(Oliver et al. 2007). Cross syndrome comparison is a
promising approach to understanding the neurobiology of
ASD and development of targeted interventions. This sort
of comparative phenotyping has been used by Bruining
et al. (2014) to stratify idiopathic ASD cases according to
behavioural signature patterns associated with genetic
disorders.

These ﬁndings should be considered in light of the
study’s limitations. Sample size was relatively small and
future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to rep-
licate these ﬁndings. We have used the autism and ASD
normative samples reported in the ADOS-2 manual as a
comparison groups. These normative children were closely
matched in terms of VIQ but were signiﬁcantly younger
than the NF1 sample. Only a parent-rated questionnaire
was used in the study rather than a clinician-rated interview
like the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R),
which along with the ADOS is considered gold standard in
the assessment of ASD and was not available on all cases.
Finally the participant data were gathered from two dif-
ferent centers with some identiﬁed differences as elabo-
rated earlier.

Conclusion

Behavioural phenotyping in genetic syndromes is a prom-
ising approach to illuminating the pathogenesis for ASD.
NF1 is an important single gene disorder model for studying
ASD with well-described neurobiology and the exciting
possibility of interventions capable of reversing the pheno-
type. Within this context, our study sheds light on the proﬁle
of ASD in NF1 thus continuing the pursuit of a biological
underpinning of the disorder. Using two standardized and
well-validated ASD instruments, the ﬁndings support pre-
vious suggestions of subtle but signiﬁcant overall differ-
ences in ASD symptomatology between NF1 and polygenic
autism. Results highlight that the use of clinical cut-off
scores and total scores alone may mask more subtle, but
potentially signiﬁcant, differences in the precise nature of
ASD symptomatology in different genetic syndromes.
