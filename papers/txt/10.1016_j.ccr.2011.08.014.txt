SUMMARY

Ras-driven tumors are often refractory to conventional therapies. Here we identify a promising targeted ther-
apeutic strategy for two Ras-driven cancers: Nf1-deﬁcient malignancies and Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer.
We show that agents that enhance proteotoxic stress, including the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, induce tumor
regression in aggressive mouse models, but only when combined with rapamycin. These agents synergize
by promoting irresolvable ER stress, resulting in catastrophic ER and mitochondrial damage. This process
is fueled by oxidative stress, which is caused by IPI-504-dependent production of reactive oxygen species,
and the rapamycin-dependent suppression of glutathione, an important endogenous antioxidant. Notably,
the mechanism by which these agents cooperate reveals a therapeutic paradigm that can be expanded to
develop additional combinations.

INTRODUCTION

Although signiﬁcant advances have been made in developing
targeted therapies, identifying treatments for tumors driven by
mutations that do not affect a targetable protein represents
a major challenge in cancer research. Ras-driven cancers are
a classic example of this challenge and despite the fact that
Ras signaling has been studied for over 25 years, there are still
no effective targeted therapies (Young et al., 2009). Small-mole-
cule inhibitors that target Ras effectors are being evaluated;
however, studies suggest that the therapeutic efﬁcacy of single
targeted agents may be limited, underscoring the need to

identify additional targets and/or more effective drug combina-
tions (Engelman et al., 2008; Young et al., 2009).

To develop new therapies, we initially focused on a distinct
subset of Ras-driven tumors: those that possess mutations in
the NF1 tumor suppressor. NF1 encodes a Ras GTPase-acti-
vating protein (RasGAP), which negatively regulates Ras by
catalyzing the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP (Martin et al., 1990;
Cawthon et al., 1990). Accordingly, NF1-deﬁcient tumors are
driven by aberrant Ras activation (DeClue et al., 1992; Johannes-
sen et al., 2005). NF1 mutations underlie neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 (NF1) (Martin et al., 1990; Cawthon et al., 1990) and NF1
is mutated or suppressed in sporadic glioblastoma (TCGA

Signiﬁcance

Ras-driven tumors are often refractory to conventional therapies and a clinically effective targeted therapy has not yet been
developed. Moreover, in some cancers KRAS mutations are used to exclude patients from being treated with speciﬁc tar-
geted agents. As such, developing an effective targeted therapy for Ras-driven tumors is an important endeavor. We have
identiﬁed a promising therapy for two distinct Ras-driven cancers: Nf1-deﬁcient nervous system malignancies and Kras/p53
mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Importantly, these studies have deﬁned a speciﬁc drug combination that can
now be assessed in patients with these largely untreatable cancers. Moreover, these studies establish a therapeutic para-
digm that can be expanded to develop additional drug combinations.

A Therapeutic Strategy for Ras-Driven Cancers

Consortium, 2008; Parsons et al., 2008; McGillicuddy et al.,
2009), NSCLC (Ding et al., 2008), and neuroblastoma (Ho¨ lzel
et al., 2010), demonstrating a broader role for NF1-loss in cancer.
The most common malignancy associated with NF1 is malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are highly
aggressive and frequently metastasize. Despite radiation, and
in some cases chemotherapy, inoperable tumors rapidly prog-
ress and can become lethal within months. As such, identifying
an effective treatment for these tumors is critical.

We and others have reported that mTOR is hyperactivated
in NF1-deﬁcient tumors as a consequence of aberrant Ras
signaling (Johannessen et al., 2005, Dasgupta et al., 2005).
Using an Nf1/p53-mutant MPNST model, we further demon-
strated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin suppressed tumor
growth (Johannessen et al., 2008). However, although the
response to rapamycin was potent, effects were cytostatic.
Therefore, we have been using this model to develop more effec-
tive mTOR-inhibitor-based combination therapies, with the
expectation that successful combinations might also be effec-
tive in other Ras and/or mTOR-driven tumors.

To identify additional therapeutic agents, we considered drugs
that might exploit speciﬁc cellular vulnerabilities of cancer cells.
In addition to the pro-tumorigenic hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan
and Weinberg, 2000), tumor cells often exhibit speciﬁc stress-
related phenotypes caused by insults such as excessive DNA
damage, as well as replicative, metabolic, and proteotoxic stress
(Luo et al., 2009). Accordingly, it has been suggested that agents
that further enhance or sensitize cancer cells to these stresses
could be developed as potential therapies (Luo et al., 2009;
Taipale et al., 2010.). In this study we investigated agents that
augment proteotoxic or ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress. ER
stress is induced when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER
(Ron and Walter, 2007). Cancer cells frequently exhibit high
levels of ER stress caused by factors such as high mutational
load, copy number variation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and
nutrient deprivation (Luo et al., 2009; Taipale et al., 2010). Aneu-
ploidy in particular has recently been shown to induce proteo-
toxic stress in both normal and cancer cells (Tang et al., 2011).
Oncogenic RAS also causes ER stress (Denoyelle et al., 2006).
Once triggered, ER stress activates a signal
transduction
pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Ron
and Walter, 2007). The UPR is initially engaged as a protective
mechanism to reduce protein accumulation; however, when
ER stress levels become insurmountable, cell death ensues
(Ron and Walter, 2007). This observation has led to the specula-
tion that agents that further enhance ER stress in vulnerable
cancer cells could be developed as anti-cancer therapies
(Luo et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2011). In this study we evaluated
the therapeutic effects of compounds that augment proteotoxic
stress in cancer cells, alone and in combination with mTOR
inhibitors, in two Ras-driven mouse tumor models.

RESULTS

MPNSTs Are Sensitive to Agents that Enhance ER Stress
To determine whether MPNSTs might be sensitive to agents that
induce ER stress, we ﬁrst evaluated basal stress levels. MPNSTs
are highly aneuploid and are driven by constitutive activation of
Ras and therefore might be subject to substantial ER stress.

Indeed, ER stress levels were much higher in tumors compared
with normal peripheral nerve, as conﬁrmed by three independent
markers of UPR activation: BiP upregulation, phosphorylation of
eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), and accumu-
lation of the spliced active form of XBP-1 (sXBP-1) (Figure 1A)
(Ron and Walter, 2007). Next, we assessed the sensitivity of
human and mouse MPNSTs to classic ER stress-inducing
agents: thapsigargin (an ER calcium ATPase inhibitor) and tuni-
camycin (a glycosylation inhibitor). Both agents enhanced ER
stress (Figure 1B) and triggered cell death at concentrations
that did not affect the viability of normal cells (Figure 1C,D), indi-
cating that MPNSTs are hypersensitive to these ER stress-
inducing agents.

ER Stress-Inducing Agents Promote Tumor Regression
In Vivo but Only When Combined with Rapamycin
Based on the hypersensitivity of MPNST cells to these agents
in vitro, we hypothesized that they might promote tumor regres-
sion. In the Nf1/p53 tumor model, animals develop MPNSTs in
5 months (Cichowski et al., 1999) and survive an average of
10.7 days after tumor detection (Johannessen et al., 2008).
Tumor-bearing animals were treated with vehicle, thapsigargin,
or rapamycin (Figure 1E). Thapsigargin exhibited minimal efﬁ-
cacy (red bars) and was less potent than rapamycin (yellow
bars). This ﬁnding was unexpected given the cytotoxic versus
cytostatic effects of
thapsigargin and rapamycin observed
in vitro (Figure 1D) (Johannessen et al., 2008). However, com-
bined rapamycin/thapsigargin treatment triggered rapid tumor
regression (green bars; p = 0.013). On average tumors shrank
45%; however, some tumors regressed >75% (Figure 1F) and
remaining masses were largely comprised of hemorrhage and
cellular debris (Figure 1G). Maximal effects were observed within
10 days, although signiﬁcant tumor regression was detected
in 3 days (Figure 1F,G). Extensive long-term survival studies
were not performed because mice often scratched or bit these
rapidly shrinking lesions, resulting in ulceration that necessitated
euthanasia. Nevertheless, when animals were successfully
treated for a longer duration, tumors did not re-grow (Figure 1F).
One animal survived 107 days after tumor development with no
evidence of relapse, surviving more than 10 times as long as
control animals (Figure 1F,G). Tunicamycin also induced tumor
regression when co-administered with rapamycin, consistent
with the conclusion that excessive ER stress was a critical driver
of this response (Figure S1).

The HSP90 Inhibitor IPI-504 Cooperates with
Rapamycin to Promote Tumor Regression
Although these observations were striking, thapsigargin and
tunicamycin do not represent clinically viable agents. HSP90
inhibitors are another class of drugs known to induce ER
stress and are currently being investigated in the clinic (www.
clinicaltrials.gov). HSP90 maintains protein homeostasis by
folding newly synthesized and misfolded proteins, assembling
and dissembling protein complexes, and resolving protein
aggregates (Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005). HSP90 also directly
stabilizes two key stress-sensing components of the UPR:
IRE1 and pPERK/PERK (Marcu et al., 2002). Therefore, HSP90
inhibitors would be expected to promote ER stress in can-
cer cells via two cooperating mechanisms: ﬁrst, by directly

impairing global protein folding in these already compromised
tumor cells, and second, by inactivating subsequent adaptive
responses provided by two arms of the UPR. Accordingly, we
assessed the therapeutic effects of IPI-504, a hydroquinone
hydrochloride salt of
the geldanamycin-derivative 17-AAG
(Sydor et al., 2006).

As predicted, IPI-504 rapidly induced ER stress and activated
the UPR, demonstrated by the upregulation of BiP, pEIF2a,
sXBP-1, IRE1, and phosphorylated PERK within 2–4 hr (Fig-
ure 2A) (Healy et al., 2009). However, prolonged exposure to
IPI-504 resulted in a destabilization of IRE1 and pPERK/PERK
(Figure 2A). Consequently, downstream UPR signals including
sXBP-1 and pEIF2a were inactivated by 8 hr, as expected
(Marcu et al., 2002) (Figure 2A). Notably, BiP levels, which are
not dependent on IRE1 and PERK, were elevated further by
16 hr, demonstrating that ER stress was enhanced in two phases
in response to IPI-504 (Figure 2A) (Marcu et al., 2002). Similar to
thapsigargin and tunicamycin, MPNST cells were sensitive to
low doses of IPI-504 in vitro (Figure 2B,C).

Using a previously established dosing schedule of IPI-504
(Douglas et al., 2009), we assessed the effects of this agent alone
and in combination with rapamycin in vivo. Like thapsigargin, IPI-
504 was unable to promote tumor regression as a single agent
but did so when combined with rapamycin (Figure 2D) (p =
0.001). On average, tumors shrank 49% (Figure 2D, green
bars). Tumor regression was visually apparent (Figure 2E) and
histological analysis revealed massive cell death and accumu-
lating debris (Figure 2F).

The pharmacodynamic response to IPI-504 in clinical trials is
assessed by measuring HSP70 levels, which increase when
HSP90 is effectively inhibited (Ramanathan et al., 2007). Target
inhibition was conﬁrmed in vivo using this readout (Figure 2G).
Rapamycin also effectively suppressed the mTOR pathway
(Figure 2G). Maximal tumor regression in response to rapamy-
cin/IPI-504 treatment occurred within 3–5 days and no toxicity
was observed in the course of this study as determined by
weight, grooming, or body score (Figure S2). TUNEL staining
was apparent within 16 hr, which was not observed in tumors
from animals exposed to rapamycin or IPI-504 alone (Figure 2H).
To mimic the dose of IPI-504 used in clinical trials, IPI-504 was
administered once rather than twice per week at 100 mg/kg.
This treatment schedule also promoted tumor shrinkage and

This Kaplan-Meier curve likely underestimates survival, because
most animals were euthanized because of self-inﬂicted damage
at the site of residual lesions (denoted by Xs) (Figure 2I). No long-
term toxicity was observed as determined after 50 days of
treatment.

IPI-504 Mediates its Therapeutic Effects by Suppressing
HSP90 and Promoting ER Stress
HSP90 is encoded by more than one gene, is extremely abun-
dant, and interacts with more than 20 co-chaperones (Taipale
et al., 2010). Therefore, it is not possible to completely inactivate
HSP90 activity by genetically suppressing a single gene.
However, two additional structurally distinct HSP90 inhibitors,
BEP800 and AUY-922 (Massey et al., 2010), as well as 17-AAG
itself, killed MPNSTs, induced ER stress, and impacted the
UPR with the same kinetics as IPI-504 (Figure 3A, B, C and Fig-
ure S3A), conﬁrming that these agents all function by suppress-
ing HSP90.

tunicamycin)

The observation that HSP90 inhibitors enhance ER stress, and
that three distinct ER stress-inducing agents (IPI-504, thapsigar-
gin,
induce the same therapeutic response,
supports the hypothesis that IPI-504 mediates its effects by trig-
gering excessive ER stress. To formally address this possibility,
we assessed whether ectopic expression of sXBP1, a down-
stream UPR component that can reduce ER stress (Ozcan
et al., 2008), might attenuate the therapeutic effects of IPI-504.
Notably, sXBP1 expression reduced and delayed cell death in
response to IPI-504 (Figure 3D). Conversely, siRNAs that recog-
nize PERK and IRE1 sensitized MPNSTs to sub-threshold doses
of IPI-504 (Figure 3E). Together these data indicate that exces-
sive ER stress plays a causal role in driving the therapeutic
response.

Rapamycin sensitized MPNSTs to IPI-504 in vitro as it does
in vivo (Figure 3F) and genetic ablation of raptor, a critical
component of TORC1, did so as well (Figure 3F). Rapamycin
also enhanced the suppressive effects of PERK and IRE1
siRNAs (Figure 3G). However, this combination was not as
potent as rapamycin and IPI-504, consistent with the notion
that PERK and IRE1 destabilization contribute to the therapeutic
response but do not entirely mediate the effects of HSP90
suppression, which has a more global effect on protein homeo-
stasis in these impaired cancer cells. Thus, both genetic and
chemical studies demonstrate that IPI-504 and rapamycin func-
tion through their intended targets (HSP90 and TORC1) and that
ER stress is an important mediator of the therapeutic response.
Interestingly, although the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can
induce proteotoxic stress in professional secretory cells (e.g.,
multiple myeloma cells), bortezomib did not substantially induce
ER stress in MPNSTs and did not promote tumor regression
when combined with rapamycin (Figure S3B), further underscor-
ing the importance of the ER stress response in mediating the
observed therapeutic effects.

suppression of negative feedback pathways (Dancey et al.,
2009). However, as we have previously reported, rapamycin
did not induce AKT activation in MPNSTs in vivo (Figure 3H)
(Johannessen et al., 2008). Moreover, combined rapamycin/
IPI-504 treatment did not suppress AKT phosphorylation or
expression levels, indicating that this combination is not more
effective because it inhibits AKT (Figure 3H). However, it is
still possible that an mTOR kinase inhibitor or dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor may synergize even more potently with HSP90 inhibi-
tors, by concomitantly suppressing this well-established survival
pathway.

Rapamycin and IPI-504 Trigger a Catastrophic
Destruction of the ER and Mitochondria in MPNSTs
In Vivo
To elucidate the biological consequences of combined rapa-
mycin/IPI-504 treatment, we performed transmission electron
microscopy on MPNSTs in vivo. Within 7 hr, rapamycin/IPI-504
induced a massive accumulation of double-membraned vesicles
(Figure 4A) (n = 5). These structures exhibited cellular hallmarks
of autophagosomes and contained visible cargo (Figure 4B)
(Klionsky et al., 2008). The ER and mitochondria can both act
as a source of membranes for autophagosomes (Hayashi-
Nishino et al., 2009; Yla¨ -Anttila et al., 2009; Hailey et al. 2010).
We detected autophagosomes emerging from both organelles
in response to rapamycin/IPI-504, the signiﬁcance of which is
discussed below (Figure 4C). The appearance of autophagic
vesicles can be caused by autophagy induction or can occur
when productive autophagy is blocked (Klionsky et al., 2008).
However rapamycin/IPI-504 induced the degradation of p62/
SQSTM1 in these tumors, which is degraded as a consequence
of productive autophagy (Figure 4D) (Klionsky et al., 2008). In
addition, rapamycin/IPI-504 triggered a rapid increase in LC3-
expressing punctae in MPNSTs, which fused with lysozomes
shortly thereafter,
indicating that autophagy was induced
rather than blocked (Figure 4E, F) (N’Diaye et al., 2009; Pankiv
et al., 2007). Notably, excessive ER stress actively triggers
autophagy, which is engaged as a protective mechanism to
degrade unfolded protein aggregates (Hotamisligil, 2010). How-
ever, although IPI-504 and rapamycin can both induce signals
that promote autophagy, individually each agent was unable to
elicit a potent autophagic response in vivo (Figure 4A), suggest-
ing that these agents were somehow synergizing.

To investigate this synergy we examined ER and mitochondria
in MPNSTs. Notably, there is a complex interdependent relation-
ship between the ER and mitochondria in response to ER
stress (Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007) (Figure 4G). ER stress
triggers intraluminal calcium release, which promotes mitochon-
drial membrane depolarization and ROS production (Malhotra

and Kaufman, 2007;Kim et al., 2008). ROS further promotes
protein misfolding, thereby enhancing ER stress. In response
to low levels of ER stress, adaptive responses are engaged;
however, when ER stress levels become insurmountable, a
vicious cycle ensues, resulting in catastrophic damage to the
ER and mitochondria, and in cell death (Malhotra and Kaufman,
2007). Consistent with the notion that rapamycin and IPI-504
synergize to induce irresolvable ER stress, we observed severe
ER swelling within 7 hr (Figure 4H). In addition, we detected a
dramatic accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates,
which occur when unfolded proteins accumulate (Figure S4).
Interestingly, after 16 hr ER membranes were nearly undetect-
able in rapamycin/IPI-504-treated tumors (Figure 4I), suggesting
that ER membranes may have been depleted by excessive
and continuous autophagy emanating from these membranes.
Finally, because excessive ER stress ultimately triggers severe
mitochondrial damage, after 16 hr mitochondria became
swollen and highly vesicularized, and were engulfed by auto-
phagosomes (mitophagy) (Figure 4J). The dramatic effects of
combined rapamycin/IPI-504 treatment on autophagy, ER
swelling and destruction, and mitochondrial damage were
observed in all tumors examined (R5/5 for each condition)
and were not detected in tumors from animals exposed to single
agents.

that

Oxidative Stress Plays a Critical Role in Mediating the
Therapeutic Response to Rapamycin and IPI-504
These observations suggest
rapamycin and IPI-504
promote tumor regression by inducing irresolvable ER stress,
continuous autophagy, and progressive damage to ER and mito-
chondria (Figure 4G). Because ROS are thought to play a critical
role in fueling this vicious cycle, we assessed the requirement
for ROS in the therapeutic response in vitro and in vivo. Impor-
tantly, IPI-504 triggered ROS production (Figure 5A) and the
antioxidant vitamin C suppressed MPNST cell death by 73%
(Figure 5B). More strikingly, when mice were pre-treated with
vitamin C, rapamycin/IPI-504 was no longer capable of inducing
tumor regression (Figure 5C). Because geldanamycin derivatives
may induce ROS via mechanisms in addition to effects on HSP90
(Sreedhar et al., 2003), we evaluated a structurally unrelated
HSP90 inhibitor. Notably, BEP800 also induced an increase in
ROS production (Figure S5A). Vitamin C also suppressed the
therapeutic effects of this agent by 78% (Figure 5D), providing
additional evidence that ROS is a general mediator of cell death
in response to this class of drugs.

Given the demonstrated importance of ROS, we investigated
whether IPI-504 and rapamycin might be synergizing in these
tumors by enhancing oxidative stress. PML has been proposed
to be an in vivo sensor of oxidative stress, because it becomes

associated with nuclear bodies in a ROS-dependent manner
(Jeanne et al., 2010). Interestingly, only rapamycin/IPI-504 treat-
ment induced the formation of PML-containing nuclear bodies in
MPNSTs (Figure 5E), suggesting that rapamycin and IPI-504
together were required to achieve maximal levels of oxidative
stress. These results were conﬁrmed by measuring ROS levels
in tumor tissue using dihydroethidium (DHE), where ROS was
elevated within 7 hr of treatment (Figure 5E). Moreover, vitamin
C suppressed the accumulation of polyubiquitin aggregates

(Figure S5B), the formation of nuclear PML bodies (Figure S5C),
the robust and sustained autophagic response (Figure S5D), ER
swelling and destruction, and mitochondrial damage (Fig-
ure S5E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that oxidative
stress is required for the therapeutic response in vivo. The ﬁnding
that ER swelling, protein aggregation, and ROS production all
occur within 7 hr of treatment (see Figures 4H, 5E, and 5F; Fig-
ure S4) and precede ATP depletion and mitochondrial destruc-
tion (Figures 5G and 4J), demonstrates that these effects are

triggered by ER stress and are not a secondary consequence of
a mitochondrial metabolic collapse. This conclusion is further
supported by the observation that sXBP1 expression sup-
presses cell death (Figure 3D).

Rapamycin and IPI-504 Promote Excessive Oxidative
Stress by Inducing ROS and Simultaneously
Suppressing the G6PD/Glutathione Antioxidant
Pathway
Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between ROS
production and ROS clearance pathways. Given that IPI-504
stimulates ROS production, we investigated whether rapamycin
might be enhancing the effects of IPI-504 by suppressing endog-
enous antioxidants. Because of
its high concentration and
central role in maintaining redox state, the reduced form of gluta-
thione (GSH) is one of the most important endogenous cellular
antioxidants (Meister and Anderson, 1983). Glutathione reduc-
tion is dependent on NADPH, which is primarily produced by
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The ﬁrst and rate-limiting
enzyme of the PPP is Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD). Accordingly, G6PD plays a well-established role in pro-
tecting cells from oxidative stress via its effects on GSH produc-
tion (Pandolﬁ et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2010; Efferth et al., 2006). The
importance of G6PD in this pathway is highlighted by the obser-
vation that hypomorphic mutations in G6PD underlie favism,
which causes acute hemolytic anemia in affected individuals
exposed to fava beans and other oxidative stressors (Belsey,
1973). Interestingly, a direct connection between G6PD and
the mTOR pathway has recently been established. Speciﬁcally,
G6PD expression can be suppressed by mTOR inhibitors
in vitro, through inhibitory effects on the transcription factor
SREBP1 (Du¨ vel et al., 2010). Therefore, we examined the
components of this pathway (SREBP1, G6PD, GSH) in MPNSTs.
Consistent with cellular studies showing that SREBP1 is regu-
lated by mTOR (Du¨ vel et al., 2010; Porstmann et al., 2008), rapa-
mycin signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of known SREBP
targets including SREBP1 itself, ACC, and FASN in vivo within
7 hr (Figure 5H,I). IPI-504 exerted a slightly suppressive effect
on SREBP1, but together both agents reduced SREBP1 expres-
sion by 92% and effectively suppressed ACC and FASN (Fig-
ure 5H,I). Rapamycin also potently suppressed G6PD mRNA
levels in MPNST tumor tissue (Figure 5J). However, rapamycin
alone had inconsistent effects on G6PD protein levels (Figure 5I),
perhaps reﬂecting a slower turnover of G6PD protein within this
short time frame. Nevertheless, rapamycin and IPI-504 together
dramatically suppressed both G6PD mRNA and protein expres-
sion in MPNSTs in vivo (Figure 5I, J). Accordingly, rapamycin/IPI-
504 caused a 34% decrease in reduced glutathione levels in
these tumors (Figure 5K, p = 0.003). The magnitude of this
decrease in GSH is particularly signiﬁcant given that individuals
affected by favism similarly exhibit a 34% mean reduction of
GSH in red blood cells, which sensitizes these cells to oxidative
stressors, resulting in severe protein misfolding and protein
aggregate formation (Szeinberg et al., 1958). Finally, to geneti-
cally conﬁrm that G6PD can play a functional role in protecting
tumor cells from IPI-504-induced oxidative stress, we ectopi-
cally expressed G6PD in MPNSTs. Importantly, G6PD sup-
pressed IPI-504-induced MPNST cell death by 50% (Figure 5L).
Taken together, these data suggest that rapamycin and IPI-504

synergize by promoting excessive oxidative stress, which is
a consequence of both IPI-504-induced ROS production and
rapamycin-dependent suppression of G6PD and GSH.

Rapamycin/IPI-504 Promotes Tumor Regression
in a Model of Kras/p53 Mutant NSCLC
To determine whether the efﬁcacy of this combination might
extend to KRAS mutant tumors, we performed a similar study
in a mouse model of NSCLC (Jackson et al., 2005). Notably,
NSCLCs are also highly aneuploid, illustrating an additional
similarity between these two tumor types. In this model, lung
adenocarcinomas are induced by intranasal administration of
adenoviral Cre, which causes the concomitant expression of
a single KrasG12D allele and loss of p53 (termed LSL-KrasG12D/+;
p53ﬂ/ﬂ). 8.5–9 weeks after infection, tumor burden was assessed
by MRI. Animals were re-imaged 1 week later to assess the rate
of tumor growth, and treatment commenced thereafter. In this
mixed genetic background, 50%–80% of the tumors were
conﬁrmed to be adenocarcinomas within 10 weeks after Cre
exposure (DuPage et al., 2009)(Figure S6). Neither rapamycin
nor IPI-504 induced tumor regression alone; however, combined
rapamycin/IPI-504 treatment resulted in dramatic tumor shrink-
age (Figure 6A). 6/8 mice exhibited this potent response and
individual responding masses shrunk up to 82% as determined
by MRI analysis (Figure 6B). The overall reduction in total
tumor volume, which is the sum of numerous independent
tumors per mouse, is shown for each animal (Figure 6C). Histo-
logical analysis of tumors two weeks after treatment conﬁrmed
substantial tumor regression (Figure 6D). However, although
tumor regression in response to rapamycin/IPI-504 was robust,
three types of tumor remnants were detected. Minimal tumor
remnants comprised of a few cells surrounding alveolar space
were observed (Figure 6E, a,b). Slightly larger remnants sur-
rounding alveoli were also detected (Figure 6E, c,d). Finally
some lesions, albeit vastly smaller than vehicle, rapamycin, or
IPI-504-treated tumors, were found (Figure 6E, e,f). However,
even in these cases, signiﬁcant gaps between tumor cells were
observed, resulting in increased alveolar space (Figure 6E, f) in
contrast to the dense, high-grade lesions observed in control
animals. Moreover, there was a rapid and qualitatively obvious
improvement in breathing in rapamycin/IPI-504-treated animals.
The observation that not all tumors exhibit the identical thera-
peutic response is consistent with the fact that each individual
lung tumor in this model represents an independent genetic
event. Notably, although combined MEK and PI3K inhibitors
have been shown to promote tumor regression in murine
NSCLCs harboring the KrasG12D mutation alone (Engelman
et al., 2008), no targeted therapy has been shown to promote
the regression of the more aggressive KrasG12D, p53-deﬁcient
tumors, underscoring the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding and its
potential impact on therapeutic development in KRAS mutant
NSCLC.

DISCUSSION

Currently, there are no effective targeted therapies for Ras-
driven cancers. Moreover, in some cancers KRAS mutations
are used to exclude patients from being treated with speciﬁc
targeted agents (Karapetis et al., 2008). As such, identifying

Cancer Cell

A Therapeutic Strategy for Ras-Driven Cancers

a targeted therapy for Ras-driven tumors is an important
endeavor.
In this study we took an orthogonal therapeutic
approach: combining an agent that targets an important down-
stream oncogenic pathway (mTOR) with agents that capitalize
on a cancer-associated cellular vulnerability, speciﬁcally the
enhanced sensitivity to proteotoxic stress (Luo et al., 2009).
Importantly, we found that several agents that induce ER stress,
including the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, cooperated with rapa-
mycin to promote dramatic tumor regression in two distinct
Ras driven-cancers. To date, no targeted agents have been
shown to be capable of causing tumor regression in either of
these highly aggressive genetically engineered models or,
more importantly, in cognate human tumors. Given that these
human cancers are generally refractory to standard therapies
there is an urgent need to develop improved treatments. Thus,
these studies have identiﬁed a promising therapeutic strategy
for these two aggressive malignancies.

However, although we found that this combination was effec-
tive in two speciﬁc Ras-driven cancers, it will be important to
determine whether its efﬁcacy will extend to other Ras-driven
tumors, other mTOR-driven tumors, and/or other tumors that
exhibit high levels of ER stress. Our data suggest that a combina-
tion of these factors will be involved and that responsive tumors
will require some dependence on mTOR and will also exhibit
high levels of ER stress. On a molecular level, mutations in
RAS, NF1, and possibly other genes that affect the mTOR
pathway, may promote sensitivity to these combined agents.
However, other variables, such as the extent of aneuploidy or
copy number variation will likely impact the therapeutic response
due to direct effects on basal ER stress levels. The recent obser-
vation that aneuploidy confers sensitivity to proteotoxic agents
in normal cells, and cancer cells in some settings, supports
this hypothesis (Tang et al., 2011).

Finally, although these studies provide compelling data to
support the clinical
investigation of rapamycin and IPI-504,
they also serve as a foundation for developing combinations
using other related agents. For example, mTOR kinase or dual
mTOR/PI3K inhibitors may enhance the efﬁcacy of this combina-
tion. Similarly, there are several structurally unrelated HSP90
inhibitors in clinical development, which should provide an array
of compounds that may differ in efﬁcacy and/or toxicity. More-
over, the mechanism by which IPI-504 and rapamycin cooperate
reveals an even broader range of drug options. For example,
other agents that enhance proteotoxic stress and/or alter the
heat shock response could be combined with agents that either
suppress antioxidant pathways or further stimulate ROS produc-
tion. In this respect it is noteworthy that ROS production is
thought to play a functional role in mediating the cytoxic effects

of many conventional chemotherapies. However,
targeted
agents may prove to be more effective if they are better tolerated
and consequently confer a greater therapeutic index. Regard-
less, the potential utility of these agents may be overlooked if
they are assessed exclusively as monotherapies in genetically
heterogeneous tumors, where individually they may exhibit
minimal activity. Indeed, none of the single agents investigated
in this study exerted a cytotoxic response when administered
individually. Moreover, our studies suggest that potential drug
combinations need to be tested empirically in rigorous models
in vivo. For example, although the proteasome inhibitor bortezo-
mib can induce proteotoxic stress in professional secretory cells
(e.g., multiple myeloma cells), bortezomib did not substantially
induce ER stress in MPNSTs and therefore did not promote
tumor regression when combined with rapamycin. These obser-
vations highlight the challenge of developing effective combina-
tion therapies and underscore the utility of using robust animal to
rapidly identify the most effective drug combinations among
numerous possibilities.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Tissues were ﬁxed in formalin and embedded in parafﬁn. A standard immuno-
ﬂuorescence protocol was followed. Antigen unmasking was performed by
boiling the slides in 10mM citrate (pH 6) for 10 min followed by 30 min cooling.
Blocking and hybridization were performed in 1x PBS with 5% serum and

(100 mg/kg) was administered once or twice weekly. Thapsigargin (0.2 mg/kg)
and tunicamycin (0.2 mg/kg) were administered twice a week. Rapamycin
was administered daily at 5 mg/kg (Johannessen et al., 2008). Compounds
given in combination were administered sequentially. Mice were treated daily
with 40 mg/kg vitamin C by oral gavage before IP injections of rapamycin and
IPI-504.

Tumor Volume Measurements
MPNST Model:
Mice were enrolled in the study when tumor size reached 300–700mm3. Tumor
size was measured every 2–3 days by Vernier calipers. Tumor volume was
calculated using the standard formula L 3 W2 3 52. Tumor volume and log2
of fold growth versus day 0 were calculated and graphed.
Lung Cancer Model:
Mice were infected with Adenoviral Cre (University of Iowa) by nasal instillation
(Jackson et al., 2005). Tumor burden was determined by MRI 8 weeks after
inhalation and again 1 week later (Engelman et al., 2008). Nine weeks after
inhalation, tumor-bearing mice were divided into cohorts and were treated
with single or double agents for 2 weeks. Lung tissues were harvested for
histopathology after the last MRI. Fixed lung tissues were stained by H&E;
tumor burden was subsequently analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH).

EM
Tumor tissues were ﬁxed for EM after 7 and 16 hr of a single dose and further
processed for standard EM techniques (Barth et al., 2010).

Statistics
All statistical analysis was performed using SYSTAT 12 software. For each da-
taset, basic statistical values (mean and standard deviation) were calculated
and normality determined (Shapiro-Wilk normality test); all datasets were
normally distributed. Thapsigargin and IPI-504 were compared with vehicle-
treated tumors; rapamycin/thapsigargin and rapamycin/IPI-504 were com-
pared with rapamycin-only-treated tumors all by Student’s t test. Survival
analysis was analyzed using the Mandel method. For the comparison of lung
tumor burden in the lung cancer model we performed an ANOVA test, followed
by Student’s t test.
