 ABSTRACT  

   The  NF1  tumor suppressor protein neuroﬁ bromin is a negative regulator of Ras. 
Neuroﬁ bromin is dynamically regulated by the proteasome, and its degradation and 
reexpression are essential for maintaining appropriate levels of Ras-GTP. Like p53,  NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin 
can be inactivated in cancer by both mutations and excessive proteasomal destruction; however, little 
is known about the mechanisms that underlie this latter process. Here, we show that a Cullin 3 (Cul3)/
kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing 7 complex controls both the regulated proteasomal degrada-
tion  of  neuroﬁ bromin  and  the  pathogenic  destabilization  of  neuroﬁ bromin  in  glioblastomas.  Impor-
tantly, RNAi-mediated  Cul3  ablation and a dominant-negative Cul3 directly stabilize neuroﬁ bromin, 
suppress Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and inhibit proliferation in an  NF1 -dependent 
manner.  Moreover,  in  glioblastomas  where  neuroﬁ bromin  is  chronically  destabilized,  Cul3  inhibition 
restabilizes the protein and suppresses tumor development. Collectively, these studies show a pre-
viously unrecognized role for Cul3 in regulating Ras and provide a molecular framework that can be 
exploited to develop potential cancer therapies. 
  SIGNIFICANCE:   This  study  identiﬁ es  the  ubiquitin  ligase  complex  that  controls  the  regulated  and 
pathogenic destruction of the NF1 tumor suppressor protein. These observations provide a molecular 
framework  for  developing  potential  therapies  for  glioblastoma,  where  neuroﬁ bromin  is  chronically 
destabilized, and reveal a new strategy to attenuate Ras that has broader therapeutic implications.

 INTRODUCTION 

 The Ras pathway is one of the most commonly deregulated 
pathways in human cancer ( 1–3 ). Oncogenic mutations in  Ras  
genes are found in a diverse set of human tumors; however, Ras 
can  also  become  hyperactivated  as  a  consequence  of  loss-of-
function mutations in genes that encode Ras GTPase–activating 
proteins (RasGAP), which negatively regulate Ras by catalyzing 
the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP ( 4–7 ). The NF1 tumor suppressor is 
the most well-studied RasGAP and is mutated in neuroﬁ broma-
tosis type I (NF1), a familial cancer syndrome affecting one in 
3,500  individuals  worldwide  ( 8 ).   NF1   has  also  been  shown  to 
be mutated or lost in sporadic glioblastoma ( 9–11 ), non–small 
cell lung cancers ( 12 ), neuroblastoma ( 13, 14 ), and melanoma 
( 15–17 ), showing a broader role for  NF1  in human cancer. 

 Although  tumor  suppressors  are  commonly  inactivated  by 
genetic  mechanisms,  the  proteasomal  destruction  of  tumor 
suppressor proteins such as p53, p27, and PTEN also contrib-
utes to their functional inactivation in human cancer ( 18–21 ). 
Moreover, in tumor types where p53 is destabilized, strategies 
aimed  at  blocking  its  pathogenic  destruction  have  been  an 
active  area  of  therapeutic  development  ( 22 ).  Neuroﬁ bromin 
is also controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its 
expression is dynamically regulated by growth factors in normal

settings ( 11 ,  23 ). More recently, we and others have found that 
 NF1 /neuroﬁ bromin expression can be ablated by genetic as well 
as proteasomal mechanisms in sporadic glioblastomas ( 9–11 ). 
However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that 
control its regulated or aberrant destruction. Here, we identify 
the ubiquitin ligase complex that controls neuroﬁ bromin sta-
bility in normal and pathogenic settings. Thus, in addition to 
identifying a new regulator of the Ras pathway, these ﬁ ndings 
can  be  used  as  a  foundation  for  developing  new  therapeu-
tic  approaches  to  treat  cancers  such  as  glioblastomas  where 
neuroﬁ bromin is chronically destabilized. These ﬁ ndings also 
reveal a new strategy to suppress Ras activation, which may be 
more broadly exploited to develop therapies for other cancers.   

 RESULTS  
 Identifying the Ubiquitin Ligase Complex that 
Regulates Neuroﬁ  bromin Degradation in Response 
to Growth Factors 

 We previously reported that a variety of growth factors trig-
ger the acute destruction of neuroﬁ bromin within 5 minutes 
of exposure, and that protein levels are reelevated 90 minutes 
thereafter  ( 23 ).  Importantly,  we  showed  that  (i)  this  tightly 
regulated degradation and reexpression of neuroﬁ bromin con-
trols  both  the  amplitude  and  duration  of  Ras–extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in response to growth 
factors, (ii) neuroﬁ bromin destruction is caused by ubiquitin-
mediated  proteasomal  degradation,  and  (iii)  neuroﬁ bromin 
stabilization prevents aberrant cellular proliferation ( 23 ). The 
kinetics  of  neuroﬁ bromin  degradation  in  response  to  serum 
are depicted in  Fig. 1A  and, as previously observed, its destruc-
tion can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors ( Fig. 1B ; refs.  11 , 
 23 ). In contrast, other RasGAPs, such as RasGAP p120 , are not 
regulated by the proteasome ( Fig. 1B ).

serum-starved NIH3T3 ﬁ broblasts stimulated with 10% serum for the times shown. RasGAP p120  (p120) is not degraded under these conditions and is 
shown as a loading control. B, serum-starved MEFs were treated with a combination of proteasome inhibitors (1 μmol/L bortezomib, 10 mmol/L MG132) 
or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 2 hours and then stimulated with 10% serum for the times indicated. Immunoblots of neuroﬁ bromin and RasGAP p120  
are shown. C, NIH3T3 ﬁ broblasts were infected with a lentiviral control or a lentivirus containing an shRNA sequence directed against speciﬁ c mam-
malian cullin genes as noted. Knockdown of cullins was conﬁ rmed by immunoblotting (IB). Neuroﬁ bromin and RasGAP p120  immunoblots of serum-starved

 To  identify  the  ubiquitin  ligase  responsible  for  neuroﬁ -
bromin degradation, we used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-
based  screening  approach.  We  focused  on  the  cullin-RING 
superfamily of E3 ligases, as these proteins have been shown 
to  play  a  critical  role  in  cell-cycle  regulation  and  growth 
control ( 24, 25 ). Cells were infected with lentiviruses encod-
ing  shRNA  sequences  that  recognize  each  of  the  mamma-
lian  cullin  subunits.  Depletion  of  Cullin  3  (Cul3),  but  not 
other  cullins,  blocked  the  degradation  of  neuroﬁ bromin  in 
response to serum ( Fig. 1C ). Notably, Cullin 1, which controls 
the  stability  of  potential  oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor 
proteins involved in cell-cycle progression and proliferation, 
such as cyclin E and p27 ( 26 ), had no effect on neuroﬁ bro-
min  degradation  ( Fig.  1C ).  Two  distinct  shRNA  constructs 
targeting  different  regions  of   Cul3   blocked  neuroﬁ bromin 
degradation, showing that this phenotype is not an off-target 
effect ( Fig. 1D ). 

 We  have  previously  shown  that  growth  factors  trigger 
neuroﬁ bromin  destabilization  by  activating  protein  kinase 
C (PKC), which provides a signal that is both necessary and 
sufﬁ cient for neuroﬁ bromin destruction ( 11 ). To determine 
whether  Cul3  mediates  PKC-regulated  neuroﬁ bromin  deg-
radation,  cells  were  treated  with  the  PKC  activator  PMA 
(phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate).  Although  neuroﬁ bromin 
was degraded in response to PKC activation in control cells, 
PMA-induced degradation was blocked in Cul3-depleted cells 
( Fig. 1E ). These results indicate that Cul3 mediates the PKC-
driven destabilization of neuroﬁ bromin.   
 Endogenous Cul3 Interacts with Neuroﬁ  bromin 
and Controls Neuroﬁ  bromin Ubiquitination 
and Degradation 

 To determine whether Cul3 directly regulates neuroﬁ bro-
min stability, cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitors,

 Figure 2.      Cul3 associates with neuroﬁ bromin and regulates its ubiquitination. A, endogenous neuroﬁ bromin, Cul3, or a control were immunoprecipi-
tated from serum-starved NIH3T3 ﬁ broblasts after stimulation with 10% serum in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and a chemical crosslinker. 
Immunoblots (IB) of neuroﬁ bromin or Cul3 immunocomplexes and whole-cell lysates (WCL) are shown. B, neuroﬁ bromin was immunoprecipitated from 
NIH3T3 ﬁ broblasts expressing dominant-negative (DN) versions of Cul3 and Cul4A. Expression of DN cullins in total cell lysates was conﬁ rmed with 
an anti-HA antibody and equal loading was conﬁ rmed by a RasGAP p120  immunoblot. Immunoblots using a neuroﬁ bromin antibody and an HA antibody 
conﬁ rm the speciﬁ c association of DN-Cul3 with neuroﬁ bromin. C, immunoblot assessing the effect of lentivirally expressed HA-tagged DN-Cul3 or 
a lentiviral control vector on neuroﬁ bromin stability in serum-stimulated NIH-3T3 ﬁ broblasts. Expression of DN-Cul3 was detected using an anti-HA

shRNA were treated with proteasome inhibitors (1 μmol/L bortezomib, 10 mmol/L MG132) for 2 hours, and stimulated with 10% serum for 5 minutes. 
Total cell lysates were isolated in buffer containing 2 nmol/L N-ethyl-maleimide to preserve polyubiquitin chains. Neuroﬁ bromin or control immunopre-
cipitations are shown. Both ubiquitin and neuroﬁ bromin blots denote a decrease in high-mobility ubiquitinated neuroﬁ bromin (brackets) in cells depleted 
of Cul3. An arrow points to unmodiﬁ ed neuroﬁ bromin. Cul3 levels and a RasGAP p120  loading control are also shown. E, Western blot depicting the expres-
sion of ectopic HA-tagged Cul3 used for  in vitro  ubiquitination reactions (top). Neuroﬁ bromin blot showing an increase in ubiquitinated neuroﬁ bromin

uitinated neuroﬁ bromin. IgG, immunoglobulin G.   

and  neuroﬁ bromin  or  Cul3  was  immunoprecipitated  from 
serum-stimulated cells. Importantly, endogenous neuroﬁ bro-
min  and  endogenous  Cul3  coprecipitate  under  the  precise 
conditions  in  which  neuroﬁ bromin  is  normally  degraded 
( Fig.  2A ).  To  conﬁ rm  a  functional  role  for  Cul3  in  this 
complex,  we  used  a  dominant-negative  fragment  of  Cul3 
(DN-Cul3).  When  expressed  as  a  truncated  fragment,  the 
N-terminal  half  of  Cul3  functions  as  a  dominant-negative 
protein  because  it  can  bind  Cul3  targets  but  is  unable  to 
recruit  the  E2  ubiquitin-conjugating  enzyme  ( 27,  28 ).  As 

such,  Cul3  substrates  directly  associate  with  this  fragment 
but  cannot  become  ubiquitinated  or  degraded.  Similar  to 
endogenous  Cul3,  DN-Cul3  also  formed  a  stable  complex 
with endogenous neuroﬁ bromin  in vivo  ( Fig. 2B ). Neuroﬁ bro-
min  did  not  coprecipitate  with  a  DN-Cul4A  fragment,  fur-
ther highlighting the speciﬁ city of this interaction. Similar to 
the  effects  of   Cul3   shRNAs,  DN-Cul3  substantially  blocked 
neuroﬁ bromin degradation ( Fig. 2C ).  

 Proteins that are targeted to the proteasome for degrada-
tion are ﬁ rst covalently modiﬁ ed with polyubiquitin chains,

resulting  in  the  accumulation  of  higher-mobility  species  of 
the  target  protein  ( 29 ).  To  conﬁ rm  that  Cul3  indeed  con-
trols  ubiquitination,  we  examined  the  ubiquitination  state 
of neuroﬁ bromin in wild-type cells or in cells in which  Cul3  
expression was suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi). Con-
sistent with previous reports, neuroﬁ bromin is ubiquitinated 
in  serum-treated  cells  exposed  to  proteasome  inhibitors, 
which can be visualized as a high-mobility smear that can be 
detected by both NF1 and ubiquitin antibodies ( Fig. 2D ; refs. 
 11 ,  23 ). Importantly,  Cul3 -speciﬁ c shRNA sequences dramati-
cally suppressed neuroﬁ bromin ubiquitination ( Fig. 2D ). To 
determine whether Cul3 was directly mediating this ubiqui-
tination, we generated a Cul3 expression construct and con-
ﬁ rmed  that  immunoprecipitated,  recombinant  Cul3  could 
ubiquitinate Nrf2, a well-established Cul3 substrate ( Fig. 2E  
and  Supplementary  Fig.  S1).  This  immunopuriﬁ ed,  recom-
binant  Cul3  also  ubiquitinated  neuroﬁ bromin  in  a  recon-
stituted   in  vitro   ubiquitination  assay  ( Fig.  2E ).  It  should  be 
noted that although ubiquitinated neuroﬁ bromin extracted 
from cells is manifested as a high-mobility smear on immu-
noblots,  we  have  consistently  found  that  neuroﬁ bromin 
ubiquitinated  in vitro  migrates as a more concentrated high-
mobility species, with less of a smeared pattern ( 11 ,  23 ). This 
is likely due to the large size of ubiquitinated neuroﬁ bromin 
(>250 kDa), which becomes maximally ubiquitinated  in vitro , 
in  addition  to  the  activity  of  deubiquitinating  enzymes   in 
vivo .  Together,  the  endogenous  coprecipitation  data,  RNAi 
and dominant-negative experiments, as well as these  in vitro  
and   in  vivo   ubiquitination  studies,  show  that  Cul3  directly 
controls  the  dynamic  ubiquitination  and  degradation  of 
neuroﬁ bromin.   
 Cul3 Loss Suppresses Ras/ERK Signaling 

 Because  neuroﬁ bromin  is  a  RasGAP,  the  effects  of  Cul3 
suppression  on  the  Ras/ERK  pathway  were  examined.  In 
response  to  serum  and  growth  factors,  ERK  and  Ras  were 
maximally activated within 5 minutes ( Fig. 3A and B ). How-
ever  Cul3 -speciﬁ c shRNAs suppressed ERK activity by nearly 
60% ( Fig. 3A ). DN-Cul3 exhibited a similar suppressive effect 
(60%) on Ras-GTP levels directly ( Fig. 3B ) and similarly sup-
pressed  ERK  activity  (Supplementary  Fig.  S2A).  We  next 
evaluated the relative contribution of neuroﬁ bromin stabili-
zation in mediating this suppressive effect on Ras signaling. 
 Cul3   shRNA  constructs  suppressed  ERK  activation  by  87% 
( Fig. 3C ), underscoring the potent effects of Cul3 suppression 
on  this  pathway.  RNAi-mediated  neuroﬁ bromin  suppres-
sion had no effect on ERK activity on its own in this setting 
( Fig.  3C ).  However,   Nf1   ablation  substantially  rescued  the 
defects  in  ERK  signaling,  increasing  ERK  activation  sixfold 
and  restoring  it  to  66%  of  maximal  levels  ( Fig.  3C ).  Taken 
together, these data show that Cul3-mediated neuroﬁ bromin 
degradation plays an essential role in regulating Ras and ERK 
and  that  Cul3  suppression  potently  inhibits  this  pathway. 
Surprisingly, however, although depletion of neuroﬁ bromin 
substantially restored ERK activation in Cul3-deﬁ cient cells, 
a  complete  rescue  was  not  observed,  suggesting  that  Cul3 
may have additional targets that impact Ras activation. Thus, 
in  addition  to  revealing  a  previously  unrecognized  role  for 
Cul3 in regulating Ras, the observation that Cul3 may affect 
this  pathway  through  neuroﬁ bromin  and  possibly  an  addi-

tional  target  protein  strengthens  the  potential  use  of  Cul3 
inhibition in suppressing the Ras pathway.    
 Growth Suppression Conferred by 
Dominant-Negative Cul3 Is Dependent on NF1 

 The  amplitude  and  duration  of  Ras/ERK  activation  have 
been  shown  to  play  an  important  role  in  restricting  or  per-
mitting  cellular  proliferation  ( 30 ).  We  therefore  evaluated 
the  effects  of  Cul3  suppression  on  cellular  proliferation. 
shRNA-mediated  depletion  of   Cul3   in  mouse  embryonic 
ﬁ broblasts (MEF) led to acute cell death (not shown), indicat-
ing that a minimal threshold of Cul3 activity is required for 
the  viability  of  these  cells,  as  has  been  previously  reported 
( 31 ).  However,  expression  of  dominant-negative  Cul3  (DN-
Cul3) was tolerated. To control for the effects of DN-Cul3 in 
these cells, we also evaluated a mutant form of DN-Cul3 that 
cannot  bind  its  substrates  (L52AE55A),  hereafter  referred 
to  as  DN-Cul3mut  ( 32 ).  We  validated  these  DN-Cul3  con-
structs by showing that expression of DN-Cul3 stabilized the 
transcription  factor  Nrf2,  a  well-established  target  of  Cul3, 
whereas  expression  of  DN-Cul3mut  had  no  effect  (Sup-
plementary  Fig.  S2B).  Importantly,  DN-Cul3,  but  not  DN-
Cul3mut,  inhibited  proliferation  and  ultimately  caused 
a  growth  arrest  in  wild-type  MEFs  ( Fig.  3D ).  In  contrast, 
 Nf1  −/−   MEFs,  which  lack  neuroﬁ bromin,  were  unaffected  by 
the  expression  of  DN-Cul3  and  proliferated  indistinguish-
ably  from   Nf1  −/−   MEFs  expressing  DN-Cul3mut  ( Fig.  3D ). 
Notably,  DN-Cul3,  but  not  DN-Cul3mut,  led  to  a  decrease 
in  activated  ERK  in  wild-type  MEFs,  whereas  ERK  acti-
vation  was  not  hampered  by  DN-Cul3  in   Nf1  −/−   MEFs 
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). These results show that the growth-
inhibitory effects of Cul3 suppression are dependent on neu-
roﬁ bromin.   

 Cul3 Regulates Neuroﬁ  bromin 
Destabilization in Glioblastomas 

 We and others have shown that one  NF1  allele is mutated 
or  lost  in  15%  to  23%  of  sporadic  glioblastomas.  However 
biallelic  inactivation  occurs  in  only  3%  of  tumors  and  cell 
lines ( 9–11 ,  33 ). Nevertheless, neuroﬁ bromin protein expres-
sion  is  suppressed  or  absent  in  a  much  higher  fraction  of 
tumors  ( 11 ).  We  have  shown  this  suppression  is  caused  by 
excessive  ubiquitin-mediated  proteasomal  degradation  and 
that  neuroﬁ bromin  destabilization  plays  an  active  role  in 
driving tumor pathogenesis ( 11 ). To determine whether Cul3 
was  responsible  for  the  destabilization  of  neuroﬁ bromin  in

neuroﬁ bromin  has  been  shown  to  be  destabilized:  U87MG, 
Gli36, and SF539. In all cases, DN-Cul3 expression resulted

( Fig. 4A ).  Cul3  shRNA sequences similarly stabilized neuroﬁ -
bromin in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly,

Mechanisms that Regulate NF1 Degradation and Ras Activation

RESEARCH ARTICLE

adaptors contain a BTB protein–protein interaction domain 
(for Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad complex; refs.  27 ,  32 ,  34, 
35 ).  BTB  domain  proteins  bind  to  Cul3  through  the  BTB 
domain and recruit substrates through diverse protein–pro-
tein  interaction  motifs  ( 36 ).  To  further  dissect  the  mecha-
nism  by  which  Cul3  regulates  neuroﬁ bromin  stability,  we 
conducted  a  proteomic/mass  spectrometry–based  screen  to 
identify the neuroﬁ bromin-associated BTB adaptor protein. 
Similar  strategies  have  been  used  to  identify  components 
of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for a variety of substrates 
( 37–39 ).  Speciﬁ cally,  mass  spectrometry  was  conducted  on 
endogenous  neuroﬁ bromin  immunoprecipitates,  generated 
from  serum-stimulated  cells  in  the  presence  of  proteas-
ome  inhibitors.  Using  this  approach,  we  detected  the  BTB 
domain-containing  protein  kelch  repeat  and  BTB  domain-
containing  7  (KBTBD7)  in  the  neuroﬁ bromin  immuno-
precipitates.  To  validate  this  interaction,  we  expressed  an 
epitope-tagged  KBTBD7  construct,  as  reliable  antibodies 
for  KBTBD7  are  not  presently  available.  Importantly,  HA-
KBTBD7 could be readily detected in a complex with endog-
enous neuroﬁ bromin ( Fig. 4C ). Although KBTBD7 contains 
a  BTB  domain,  its  ability  to  interact  with  Cul3  has  not 
been  previously  evaluated.  Importantly,  endogenous  Cul3 
coprecipitated  with  KLHL21,  an  established  Cul3-binding 
BTB  protein  ( 40 ),  as  well  as  KBTBD7  ( Fig.  4D ).  Moreover, 
shRNA-mediated  depletion  of   Kbtbd7   blocked  the  serum-
stimulated  degradation  of  neuroﬁ bromin  in  NIH3T3  cells 
( Fig. 4E ), mirroring the block in neuroﬁ bromin degradation 
caused by Cul3 depletion ( Figs. 1  and  2 ). Finally, RNAi-medi-
ated  KBTBD7  depletion caused an increase in neuroﬁ bromin 
levels  in  glioblastoma  cell  lines  in  which  neuroﬁ bromin  is 
normally destabilized ( Fig. 4F and G ). Together, these ﬁ nd-
ings show that Cul3 uses KBTBD7 as the adaptor protein to 
regulate neuroﬁ bromin stability.   
 DN-Cul3 Suppresses Transformation and Tumor 
Growth through Its Effects on Neuroﬁ  bromin 

 The  observation  that  neuroﬁ bromin  was  stabilized  by 
 Cul3  shRNAs and DN-Cul3 raised the intriguing possibility 
that  Cul3  inhibition  might  also  suppress  the  transformed 
properties  of  these  cancer  cells.  To  ascertain  the  biologic 
consequences  of  Cul3  suppression  in  glioblastomas,  we 
compared  the  effects  of  the  DN-Cul3  in  glioblastoma  cells 
in  which  neuroﬁ bromin  was  destabilized  by  the  protea-
some,  as  compared  with  cells  that  were  conﬁ rmed  to  be 
genetically  NF1 -deﬁ cient ( 11 ). Expression of DN-Cul3 signif-
icantly reduced the ability of  NF1  wild-type/neuroﬁ bromin- 
destabilized glioblastoma cells to form colonies in soft agar, 
as  compared  with  cells  that  expressed  equivalent  levels  of 
the control DN-Cul3mut, which had no effect in preventing 
colony  growth  ( Fig.  5A  and  B ).  In  contrast,  DN-Cul3  had 
no  effect  on  the  ability  of   NF1 -null  cells  to  form  colonies 
( Fig. 5A and B ).  

 Finally,  we  investigated  whether  DN-Cul3  activity  could 
affect  the  ability  of  glioblastoma  cells  to  form  xenograft 
tumors  in vivo . Although U87 cells readily formed tumors in 
the ﬂ anks of immunocompromised mice, DN-Cul3 potently 
suppressed  tumor  development  ( Fig.  5C ;   P   =  0.00044).  In 
contrast,  expression  of  DN-Cul3  did  not  prevent  tumor 
growth  in  mice  injected  with   NF1 -null  LN319  cells,  which 

are genetically  NF1 -deﬁ cient. Because DN-Cul3 likely affects 
other targets, we directly evaluated the contribution of neu-
roﬁ bromin  stabilization  in  tumor  suppression.  To  exam-
ine  this  in  an  isogenic  setting,  we  used  U87shp53  cells, 
which  are  able  to  tolerate  complete  NF1  ablation  ( 11 ). 
DN-Cul3,  but  not  control  DN-Cul3mut,  similarly  inhib-
ited tumor growth when expressed in these cells. However, 
RNAi-mediated   NF1   suppression  restored  tumorigenicity 
( Fig. 5D–F ), indicating that the tumor-suppressive effects of 
DN-Cul3  were  dependent  on  NF1.  Collectively,  these  data 
show that Cul3 suppression can potently inhibit the tumor-
igenic properties of glioblastomas in which neuroﬁ bromin 
has  been  inactivated  by  the  proteasome,  thus  revealing  a 
mechanism-based vulnerability that can be used to develop 
new potential therapies. Importantly, this vulnerability may 
extend  beyond  glioblastomas  and  may  ultimately  be  har-
nessed  as  a  means  of  suppressing  Ras  signaling  in  other 
cancers.  A  model  describing  the  pathway  identiﬁ ed  here  is 
shown in  Fig. 6 .     

 DISCUSSION 

 The  Ras  pathway  plays  an  essential  role  in  transducing 
signals from activated growth factor receptors and regulates 
a  wide  variety  of  biologic  responses  ( 30 ).  The  proper  inten-
sity  of  Ras/ERK  signaling  has  been  shown  to  be  essential 
for  dictating  speciﬁ c  cellular  responses  and  can  determine 
whether a cell proliferates, arrests, differentiates, survives, or 
dies  ( 30 ,   41 ).  However,  there  is  still  little  known  about  the 
precise molecular events that regulate the timing, duration, 
and intensity of Ras signaling that control these diverse bio-
logic behaviors. Here, we report that Cul3 and the BTB adap-
tor  protein  KBTBD7  regulate  the  ubiquitination  and  rapid 
degradation of neuroﬁ bromin in response to growth factors. 
Although we cannot rule out the involvement of additional 
ligases in some settings, in this report we show that Cul3 is 
essential  for  full  activation  of  the  Ras/ERK  pathway.  More-
over, Cul3 suppression potently inhibits Ras/ERK activation 
and cellular proliferation through its effects on neuroﬁ bro-
min.  Thus,  these  studies  reveal  a  previously  unrecognized 
regulatory  component  of  the  Ras  signal  transduction  path-
way and provide fundamental insight into how Ras activity is 
so exquisitely regulated. 

 Notably,  the  excessive  destabilization  of  neuroﬁ bromin 
has  also  been  shown  to  underlie  the  pathogenesis  of  glio-
blastomas ( 11 ). Here, we show that Cul3 and KBTBD7 also 
mediate this instability. Moreover, Cul3 suppression potently 
inhibits  tumorigenicity  by  stabilizing  neuroﬁ bromin.  We 
have  previously  reported  that  PKC  activation  triggers  neu-
roﬁ bromin  degradation  in  response  to  growth  factors  and 
that excessive PKC activity causes chronic destabilization in 
a subset of glioblastomas ( 11 ,  23 ). The molecular events that 
drive  this  destruction  are  currently  unknown;  however,  the 
insight  provided  in  this  study  will  serve  as  the  foundation 
for future investigations. Importantly, an oncogenic role for 
Cul3  or  KBTBD7  has  not  previously  been  described  in  the 
pathogenesis of human cancer. Moreover, the involvement of 
Cul3 in regulating neuroﬁ bromin and Ras may be exploited 
to suppress tumor development. For example, based on these 
studies, a Cul3 or a general cullin inhibitor would be expected

 Figure 6.      The Cul3 E3 ligase regulates NF1 ubiquitination and stability in normal and pathogenic settings. Upon growth factor receptor stimula-
tion, PKC becomes activated, which triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of neuroﬁ bromin by the proteasome. This ubiquitination is catalyzed 
by the Cul3 E3 ligase and the BTB adaptor protein KBTBD7. In normal cells, this degradation contributes to Ras/ERK activation. Shortly thereafter, 
neuroﬁ bromin levels become reelevated and properly terminate the Ras signal. However, excessive PKC activity in some glioblastomas results in 
chronic neuroﬁ bromin destabilization. The data presented here also show that Cul3 and KBTBD7 mediate this pathogenic destruction. Ub, ubiquitin;

(e.g., glioblastomas). Notably, a small-molecule inhibitor that 
targets NEDD8, a critical regulatory component of the cullin-
RING ligases, has already been developed (MLN4924; ref.  42 ). 
MNL4924  has  been  shown  to  trigger  cell  death  in  a  variety 
of  cancer  cell  lines,  exhibits  signiﬁ cant  antitumor  activity 
in  xenograft  assays,  and  is  presently  being  evaluated  in  sev-
eral phase I clinical trials for solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies ( 42, 43 ). More recently, cell-based screens iden-
tifying inhibitors of individual cullin-RING ligases have been 
reported  ( 44–46 ),  describing  the  ﬁ rst  attempts  at  drug  dis-
covery for this class of ubiquitin ligases. Finally, the insight 
that p53 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system has 
inspired the development of numerous small-molecule inhib-
itors speciﬁ cally aimed at blocking its destruction, which are 
now being extensively evaluated in the clinic ( 22 ,  47 ). Thus, 
the observations presented here should provide the molecu-
lar framework and rationale to evaluate and develop agents 
aimed at blocking neuroﬁ bromin destruction and Ras activa-
tion, which may impact therapeutic development in glioblas-
toma,  and  possibly  other  cancers  which  more  generally  rely 
on receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras signaling networks.   

 METHODS  
  Cell Culture  

 NIH3T3  ﬁ broblasts  were  cultured  in  Dulbecco’s  Modiﬁ ed  Eagle 
Medium  (DMEM)  supplemented  with  calf  serum.  Primary  MEFs 
and  293T  cells  were  cultured  in  DMEM  supplemented  with  fetal 
calf  serum  (FCS)  and   L -glutamine.  For  serum  starvation  involv-
ing  NIH3T3  ﬁ broblasts,  cells  were  trypsinized,  neutralized  with 
0.5 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor in DMEM, washed, and plated 
as  indicated  below  in  serum-free  media.  MEFs  were  made  quies-
cent  as  previously  described  ( 48 )  by  ﬁ rst  growing  to  conﬂ uency 
over 72 hours, then changing media to 0.1% FCS for 72 additional 
hours and washed, resuspended, and plated in serum-free media for 
18 hours before stimulation. U87, Gli36, SF539, and LN319 glioblas-
toma cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 
 L -glutamine. All non-MEF cell lines were obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). No additional authentication was 
conducted by the authors.   

  Degradation Time Courses and Proteasome Inhibition  

 NIH3T3 ﬁ broblasts were plated in serum-free DMEM at a density of 
5 × 10 5  cells/10 cm culture dish. After 18 hours, cells were stimulated 
with 10% calf serum for the times indicated. For PKC stimulation, cells

were  treated  with  10  nmol/L  PMA.  Quiescent  MEFs  were  plated  at  a 
density of 5 × 10 5  cells/10 cm culture dish for 18 hours and stimulated 
with 10% FCS or 6 μ mol/L lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)  for the times indi-
cated. Cells were lysed at speciﬁ ed time points with 1% SDS boiling lysis 
buffer and clariﬁ ed. For experiments that required proteasome inhibition 
as indicated in the text, cells were pretreated with 1 μ mol/L bortezomib 
(LC laboratories) and 10 μ mol/L MG 132 (Boston Biochem) or vehicle 
(dimethyl sulfoxide) for 2 hours before stimulation with serum or LPA.   

  Immunoblotting  

 Clariﬁ ed cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration, sep-
arated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene 
diﬂ uoride  membrane  for  immunoblotting  with  the  following  anti-
bodies: neuroﬁ bromin antibodies: UP69: a polyclonal antibody raised 
against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, RNSIKKIV, 
1:5,000;  or  NF1-A300-140A  (Bethyl),  1:1,000;  p120RasGAP  (Trans-
duction  Laboratories),  1:2,000;  HA  (for  epitope-tagged  contructs;

ylated ERK (Transduction Laboratories), 1:3,000; ERK (Transduction 
Laboratories), 1:3,000; ubiquitin (DAKO), 1:1,000.   

  Interactions between Neuroﬁ  bromin and Cul3  

 To detect interactions between endogenous Cul3 and neuroﬁ bromin, 
serum-starved  NIH3T3  cells  were  treated  with  proteasome  inhibitors 
and stimulated with serum, as described above. At the time of serum 
stimulation,  the  chemical  cross-linker  DSP  [dithiobis(succinimidylpr
opionate)]  (Thermo  Scientiﬁ c)  was  added  to  a  ﬁ nal  concentration  of 
1 mmol/L for 20 minutes, and the reaction quenched with 100 mmol/L 
Tris for 10 minutes, before lysis in ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP)  
buffer  (0.3%  CHAPS,  10  mmol/L  HEPES  pH  7.5,  120  nmol/L  NaCl, 
1  mmol/L  EDTA,  10  mmol/L  sodium  pyrophosphate,  50  mmol/L 
sodium ﬂ uoride) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibi-
tors  (Roche).  Lysates  were  incubated  for  15  minutes  on  ice,  clariﬁ ed, 
combined, and split into equivalent samples for parallel immunoprecip-
itations of neuroﬁ bromin, Cul3, or a control reaction with 2 μ g each of 
neuroﬁ bromin-D antibody (Santa Cruz), Cul3 antibody (H-293; Santa 
Cruz), or normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Cell Signaling), rotat-
ing overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were immobilized on Pro-
tein A beads, rotating for 1 hour at 4°C, and washed three times with IP 
buffer before denaturation and separation by SDS-PAGE. Western blots 
were probed with antibodies as described above, using conformation-
speciﬁ c secondary antibodies (Rockland). To detect interactions between 
DN-Cul3  and  neuroﬁ bromin,  cells  were  transduced  with  DN-Cul3 
(see below) or control vectors as described in the text. Neuroﬁ bromin 
was  immmunoprecipitated  from  cells  using  IP  buffer  supplemented 
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors only (Roche). Samples were 
immobilized on Protein A beads, washed three times with IP buffer, and 
separated by SDS-PAGE before Western blot analysis.   

  Detection of Ubiquitinated NF1 In Vivo  

 NIH3T3 cells were stably transduced with a pLKO control vector 
or pLKO containing a  Cul3  shRNA and plated in serum-free DMEM 
at a density of 5 × 10 5  cells/10 cm culture dish. After 18 hours, cells 
were treated with a combination of 10 μ mol/L MG132 and 1 μ mol/L 
bortezomib  for  2  hours,  then  stimulated  for  5  minutes  with  10% 
calf  serum  before  lysing  cells.  To  enrich  for  ubiquitinated  neuroﬁ -
bromin,  three  10  cm  dishes  for  each  condition  were  washed  and 
lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 
protease  and  phosphatase  inhibitors  (Roche),  supplemented  with 
2  mmol/L  N-ethyl-maleimide  (Sigma),  which  inactivates  deubiqui-
tinase  enzymes.  Lysates  were  clariﬁ ed  and  precleared  with  Protein 
A  beads,  and  neuroﬁ bromin  was  immunoprecipitated  with  2  μ g 
neuroﬁ bromin-D antibody (Santa Cruz), and an equivalent control 

sample  with  rabbit  IgG  (Cell  Signaling),  rotating  overnight  at  4°C. 
Immunocomplexes  were  immobilized  on  Protein  A  beads,  rotating 
for 1 hour at 4°C, then washed three times with wash buffer before 
denaturation  and  separation  by  SDS-PAGE.  Western  blots  were 
probed with ubiquitin antibody (DAKO), then stripped and reprobed 
with  neuroﬁ bromin  antibody  (Bethyl),  using  conformation-speciﬁ c 
secondary antibodies (Rockland).   

  In Vitro Ubiquitination  

 Neuroﬁ bromin  immunoprecipitated  from  cycling  NIH3T3  cells 
was  used  as  a  ubiquitination  substrate  (ATCC).  Speciﬁ cally,  two  15 
cm dishes were washed three times with PBS and lysed with ice-cold 
IP buffer (0.3% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.5, 120 nmol/L NaCl, 
1  mmol/L  EDTA,  10  mmol/L  sodium  pyrophosphate,  50  mmol/L 
sodium ﬂ uoride) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhib-
itors (Roche). Lysates were incubated for 15 minutes on ice, clariﬁ ed, 
combined  and  split  into  equal  amounts  for  parallel  immunopre-
cipitations, each with 2 μ g neuroﬁ bromin-D antibody (Santa Cruz), 
rotating  overnight  at  4°C.  Immunoprecipitations  were  immobilized 
on  Protein  A  beads,  rotating  for  1  hour  at  4°C,  then  washed  three 
times with IP buffer followed by three times with ubiquitination wash 
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L MgCl 2 ). To assess NF1 
ubiquitination catalyzed by Cul3 directly, exogenous HA-tagged Cul3 
was expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Cells were stimulated with serum for 
2 minutes, and Cul3 was immunoprecipitated in ice-cold IP buffer for 
2 hours and immobilized on protein A beads, washed three times with IP 
buffer and ubiquitination wash buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 
5 mmol/L MgCl 2 ) before  in vitro  ubiquitination reactions. Ubiquitina-
tion  reactions  were  assembled  containing  the  following  and  mixed 
with  NF1-IP-beads:  50  mmol/L  Tris-HCl  pH.7.5,  5  mmol/L  MgCl 2 , 
2 mmol/L ATP (Sigma), 10 mmol/L phosphocreatine (Sigma), 3.5 U/mL 
μ mol/L  ubiquitin  aldehyde 
creatine  phosphokinase  (Sigma),  1 
 (Boston Biochem), 5 μ g ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 220 ng human 
E1  (Boston  Biochem),  500  ng  E2  (UbcH5a)  (Boston  Biochem),  and 
HA-Cul3  IP  or  control  beads  from  an  IgG  immunoprecipitation  as 
shown. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes and stopped 
by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 minutes. Western blots were immu-
noblotted with neuroﬁ bromin antibody (Bethyl). For ubiquitination 
reactions using Nrf2 as a substrate, GFP-Nrf2 was expressed in 293T 
cells and immunopuriﬁ ed with a GFP antibody (Invitrogen). Ubiqui-
tination reactions were set up as described above.   

  Generation of Constructs  

 DN-CUL3  (amino  acids  1-418)  and  DN-CUL4A  (amino  acids 
1-439)  were  cloned  by  PCR  ampliﬁ cation  including  an  N-terminal 
HA  epitope.  All  fragments  were  cloned  into  pENTR-D  TOPO  (Inv-
itrogen)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions  to  gener-
ate  pENTR-D  clones  containing  HA-tagged  DN-cullins.  Mutant 
DN-Cul3 (L52AE55A) was generated using a site-directed mutagen-
esis kit (Clontech). Entry clones were subcloned into pLenti TO-puro 
destination  vector  ( 49 )  via  Gateway-mediated  LR  recombination 
(Invitrogen) to generate lentiviral expression vectors. Clones express-
ing full-length cDNAs of KBTBD7, KLHL21, LacZ, and Nrf2 in the 
pDONR223 vector were obtained from the Human Orfeome collec-
tion (Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA) and subcloned into 
the  lentiviral  expression  vector  pHAGE-C-HA-FLAG  (W.  Harper, 
Harvard  Medical  School,  Boston,  MA)  by  Gateway  recombination 
using  LR-clonase  II  (Invitrogen)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions. Nrf2 was cloned into pHAGE N-GFP-blast expression 
vector (W. Harper). All ﬁ nal sequences were veriﬁ ed.

  Identiﬁ  cation of Neuroﬁ  bromin-Interacting BTB Proteins  

 Brieﬂ y, a hundred 15 cm plates of serum-deprived T98G glioblas-
toma  cells  were  pretreated  with  proteasome  inhibitors  for  2  hours 
and restimulated with FCS. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS 
and lysed in ice-cold 0.3% CHAPS buffer (0.3% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L 
HEPES  pH  7.5,  120  nmol/L  NaCl,  1  mmol/L  EDTA,  10  mmol/L 
sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmol/L sodium ﬂ uoride) supplemented 
with  protease  and  phosphatase  inhibitors  (Roche).  Lysates  were 
incubated for 15 minutes on ice, clariﬁ ed, precleared two times with 
agarose beads and two times with protein A beads for 1 hour each 
time,  and  split  into  equal  amounts  for  parallel  immunoprecipita-
tions with 50 μ g of neuroﬁ bromin antibodies (sc-67 or sc-68; Santa 
Cruz), rotating overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were immo-
bilized on 150 μ L Protein A beads, rotating for 2 hours at 4°C, and 
washed  ﬁ ve  times  with  IP  buffer.  Samples  were  separated  by  SDS-
PAGE  on  4%–12%  gradient  mini  gels,  and  proteins  were  visualized 
with  Coomassie  Safely  Blue  stain  (Invitrogen).  The  experimental 
lines were excised into small fragments, rinsed in 10% acetonitrile, 
and  submitted  for  mass  spectrometry  analysis  at  the  Beth  Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center Mass Spectrometry Core facility.   

  Quantitative PCR  

 To  detect  shRNA-mediated  knockdown  of   Kbtbd7   and   KBTBD7  
in  mouse  and  human  cell  experiments,  respectively,  total  RNA  was 
extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthe-
sized using the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta), following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was conducted using 
PerfeCTa  Sybr  Green  Mix  (Quanta)  following  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Expression  levels  of  Kbtbd7  were  normalized  against 
 Gapdh  expression, and  KBTBD7  expression was normalized to  HPRT1 
 expression.  The  following  primers  were  used:  Kbtbd7_F  (5′-aagag
cactacctggga-3′),  Kbtbd7_R  (5′-cttggcaaccactgacttgt-3′),  Gapdh_F 
(5′-actccactcacggcaaattc-3′),  Gapdh_R 
(5-tctccatggtggtgaagaca-3′), 
KBTBD7_F  (5′-cagtccgctcactctctatgt-3′),  KBTBD7_R  (5′-agacgccttc
gaccatcac-3′),  HPRT1_F  (5′-gccggctccgttatgg-3′),  HPRT1_R  (5′-aacct
ggttcatcatcactaatca-3′).   

  Ras Activation Analysis  

 Primary MEFs were serum-starved by culturing to conﬂ uency for 4 
days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, then changing media to 
0.1% FCS for 3 additional days. Cells were then resuspended, washed, 
and  plated  in  serum-free  DMEM  overnight.  Cells  were  stimulated 
with  6  μ mol/L  LPA  for  the  times  indicated.  Ras-GTP  levels  were 
detected using a Ras activation assay, following the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Upstate). Ras activation was quantiﬁ ed by using DNA j 

software to assess the amount of Ras that was pulled down by GST-
Ras–binding domain fusion protein divided by total levels of Ras in 
the lysates. Values at 5 and 15 minutes were then divided by values 
observed in unstimulated control cells to establish relative levels of 
Ras activation.   

  Proliferation Studies  

 Quiescent MEFs were split to a density of 150,000 cells per well of 
a six-well dish in triplicate and then stimulated with serum. At each 
indicated time, cells were trypsinized and counted. Fold increase in 
cell number ratios was calculated by dividing the average cell number 
of three plates in serum at the indicated time points by the average 
cell number of three plates in serum-free medium after 18 hours.   

  Colony Growth in Soft Agar  

 Soft agar assays were conducted as previously described ( 50 ).   

  Xenograft Tumor Studies  

 All  animal  procedures  were  approved  by  the  Center  for  Animal 
and  Comparative  Medicine  at  the  Harvard  Medical  School  in 
accordance with the NIH Guild for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Subcutaneous implantations 
were carried out in 6-week-old athymic female nude mice (Charles 
River) by injecting 10 6  cells in 100 μ L of PBS (six or eight injections 
per  condition  as  described  in  the  text).  Two  weeks  after  injection 
(day  0),  the  width  and  length  of  the  tumor  were  measured  twice 
weekly by caliper and the volume was calculated with the following 
formula:  volume =  (length ×  width 2 )π/6.  Tumors  were  monitored 
for 5 months.   

  Statistical Analyses  

 If data were normally distributed, statistical analysis was done by 
Student  t  test. Otherwise, we used the Mann–Whitney  U  test. Speciﬁ c 
tests  are  noted  in  the  text  and  ﬁ gure  legends.  All  numerical  data, 
including error bars, represent the mean ± SD of experiments carried 
out in triplicate.
