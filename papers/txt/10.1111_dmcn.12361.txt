AIM Motor skill impairment and cognitive dysfunction are commonly reported features of
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). We characterized and determined the relationship between
motor impairment, gait variables, and cognitive function in children and adolescents with
NF1.
METHOD Motor function, gait, and neurocognitive abilities were assessed in 46 children and
adolescents with NF1 (26 males, 20 females; age range 7–17y; mean age 11y 1mo, SD 3y
2mo). Tests to establish correlations between neurocognitive, motor, and gait variables were
performed.
RESULTS Compared with normative data, 28/39 of our NF1 cohort demonstrated impaired
performance for balance and upper limb coordination and 16/38 for running speed and
agility. Gait data revealed a strategy to preserve balance at the expense of velocity, with the
unexpected exception of a tendency for reduced base of support. Neurocognitive testing
conﬁrmed mean IQ in the low average range (86.0) and deﬁcits in spatial working memory
and strategy generation. Signiﬁcant correlations between a number of neurocognitive
measures and motor abilities and gait were identiﬁed. The largest associations were between
gait width and spatial working memory (r=0.594) and running speed and agility with strategy
generation (r=0.549).
INTERPRETATION We have identiﬁed a relationship between balance, running speed and
agility, gait, and cognition in children with NF1. Findings suggest a shared abnormal
neurodevelopmental process underlying some cognitive and motor abilities in NF1. Results
are discussed within the context of evidence highlighting abnormal dopamine-mediated
corticostriatal circuitry in NF1.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant
genetic condition with a birth incidence of 1 in 2700 indi-
viduals.1 Caused by a mutation in the gene encoding neu-
roﬁbromin on chromosome 17q11.2, NF1 is characterized
by a diverse range of cutaneous, neurological, and neoplas-
tic manifestations, including cafe-au-lait macules, skinfold
freckling, neuroﬁbromas, and optic pathway tumours.2
Skeletal anomalies have also been documented, including
scoliosis,
tibial dysplasia/pseudoarthrosis, and sphenoid
wing dysplasia. Neurocognitive impairment is also well
documented in children with NF1.3,4 Although intelligence
tends to be only mildly affected, speciﬁc impairments on
measures of attention, executive function,
language, and
visual perception are common. Given the frequency and
severity of cognitive deﬁcits, it is not surprising that up to
70% of children with NF1 underachieve at school, with

There is an emerging body of evidence demonstrating
motor impairment as a common feature of NF1 in child-
hood.4,6,7 Early research in this area documented problems
with manual dexterity, balance, and ball skills, with 32% of
children exhibiting severe impairment of coordination
skills.8 More recently, Johnson et al. compared children
with NF1 with normative data on the Bruininks Oseretsky
Test of Motor Proﬁciency, 2nd Edition (BOT-2).6 Chil-
dren with NF1 displayed signiﬁcantly impaired motor
skills across a number of domains; the largest effect sizes
were observed for measures of balance, upper limb coordi-
nation, and running speed and agility. With regard to ﬁne
motor skills, Hyman et al. reported impaired performance
on the grooved pegboard task and reported a correlation

Reduced motor competency may contribute to a range
of poor outcomes for children with NF1. Gross motor
skill impairments, for example, have been shown to pre-
dict a range of social, emotional, behavioural, and aca-
demic
developmental
coordination disorder, all of which are common features
of the NF1 phenotype.3,9,10 Relationships have also been
demonstrated between motor coordination and neurocog-
nitive performance in normative samples11 and clinical
cohorts.12 Children with delayed gross motor skills, for
example, are at a higher risk of impairment in attention,
self-regulation,
language, and scholastic achievement. A
number of recent studies have highlighted a speciﬁc rela-
tionship between motor difﬁculties and executive function-
including working memory.12–14 This
ing impairments,
relationship is
intriguing given that particular brain
regions, such as the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, are
associated with cognitive and motor problems, suggesting
a common mechanism.15 It
is possible that common,
domain-general, neurocognitive mechanisms are involved
in the cognitive and motor impairments observed in NF1.
To date, however,
these relationships have not been
examined.

Despite the recognition of poor motor coordination in
children with NF1, there have been no studies that speciﬁ-
cally analyse gait in children with the condition. Gait
abnormalities have been reported in a number of develop-
mental conditions, including attention-deﬁcit–hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD),16,17 which is comorbid in approximately
40% of children with NF1.4 Converging data suggest that
ADHD symptoms and executive impairments may be sec-
ondary to abnormalities in frontostriatal-cerebellar cir-
cuits,18 which are also crucial
for posture and gait
control.19,20

The current study had two primary aims. The ﬁrst was
to examine motor proﬁciency and gait in children and ado-
lescents with NF1. The second was to establish the rela-
tionship between gross motor
and gait with
cognition, especially executive function. A better under-
standing of the relationship between these parameters may
provide a basis for more effective early interventions.

METHOD
Participants
Forty-six children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years with
a diagnosis of NF1 were recruited on a sequential basis
from the Neurogenetics Clinic at The Children’s Hospital
at Westmead, Australia. Participants with NF1 fulﬁlled the
diagnostic criteria speciﬁed by the National Institutes of
Health Consensus Conference.21 Clinic demographics have
been previously described.22

Children were excluded if they had diagnosed intracra-
nial pathology (other than asymptomatic optic gliomas),

assessment.

Procedure and materials
Before assessment, a medical history of all participants was
obtained from their parent(s)/legal guardians. In addition,
the medical ﬁle of the participants was reviewed.

Motor skills were assessed using the BOT-2, a well-vali-
dated movement assessment tool that is frequently used to
assess movement disorders in childhood and has been
shown to be reliable and sensitive in children from the
general population and those with an intellectual disabil-
ity.23,24 Subtests of balance, upper limb coordination, and
running speed and agility were assessed as these have been
shown to yield the largest effect sizes from age-matched
normative data in a previous study of children with NF1.6
Subdomain raw scores were converted to scaled scores
using normative age- and sex-speciﬁc data from the BOT-2
manual.

Gait was assessed using the GAITRite (CIR Systems
Inc., Haverton, PA, USA) electronic instrumented walkway
in our paediatric gait analysis laboratory.25 The GAITRite
is a 420cm length mat, which has 16 128 sensors at a res-
olution of 1/cm2 and a sample rate of 80 Hz. The reliabil-
ity and validity of the GAITRite has been well established
in children.26–28 Children were instructed to walk down
the mat at their own pace. The following temporospatial
gait parameters were recorded and averaged by the
GAITRite software: velocity (cm/s), cadence (steps/min),
step time (s), step length (cm), stride length (cm), base of
support (cm), and single and double support percentage of
gait cycle (%GC). Adequate space at either end of the
walkway ensured that the children were recorded at their
self-selected speed, so acceleration and deceleration did
not occur during the trial. Three trials were recorded for
each child and averaged for analysis using GAITRite soft-
ware, version 3.8.

Cognitive assessment was conducted individually in a
quiet, well-lit room and was completed in one session. Rest
breaks were provided as necessary. Intellectual
function
was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children 4th Edition (WISC-IV), which provided four
index scores (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reason-
ing, Working Memory, Processing Speed) and a Full Scale
IQ (FSIQ). Two participants, aged 17 years, completed
the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd Edition rather

the

Spatial working memory was assessed using the Spatial
Working Memory (SWM) subtest of the Cambridge Neu-
ropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).29
Detailed descriptions of this measure have been reported
elsewhere.30 SWM is a self-ordered task that assesses par-
ticipants’ ability to retain and manipulate spatial informa-
tion in immediate memory. The two SWM outcome
measures reported in this study are (1) between search
errors, representing the total number of errors made dur-
ing the task, and (2) a strategy score, reﬂecting the degree
to which searches are conducted in a systematic manner.
SWM has been validated in a number of different patient
including NF1.30 Impaired strategy scores have
groups,
been selectively associated with frontal lobe damage, and
reduced working memory performance has been reported
after damage to frontal and temporal cortex.31,32 Norma-
tive scores for CANTAB tasks were obtained from age-
matched data provided with the CANTAB software. Before
SWM was completed, participants were administered a
motor coordination screening task from the CANTAB to
assess whether they were capable of using the touch screen
apparatus. All participants completed this task adequately.

In order to examine the relationship between motor abil-
ities and behavioural aspects of executive functions, par-
ents/legal guardians of participants completed the Behavior
Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) – Parent
Version.33 The BRIEF allows for a broad assessment of
executive function in a real-world context. Although the
questionnaire provides eight distinct clinical scales, to min-
imize the risk of type I error, we have only reported the
two indices (Behavioral Regulation Index, Metacognitive
Index) and the composite score, which incorporates all
eight clinical scales (Global Executive Composite). The
clinical validity of the BRIEF has been supported in a
including ADHD,34 autism
variety of diagnostic groups,
spectrum disorder,35 and NF1.22

Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants before assessment. The study was approved by the
human research ethics committee of the Sydney Children’s
Hospitals Network and the University of Sydney.

Statistical analysis
Data were analysed with the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences, version 21 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp.,
NY, USA). Normality of data distribution was assessed
using Shapiro Wilk and Kolmogorov Smirnov tests. Med-
ian and interquartile range have been reported for data that
were not normally distributed. Raw data from the balance,
running speed and agility and upper limb coordination
domains from the BOT-2 were converted to scaled scores
using normative data from the test manual, and submitted
to one sample Student’s t-tests to explore differences from
normative reference values. Gait variables were converted
to z-scores based on normative age-matched data.36–38 The
p values were then calculated using one sample Student’s

t-tests (two-tailed). Gait variables of participants aged 16
and 17 were presented as raw data but could not be
included in the correlation analysis as there were no GAI-
TRite normative data available for these ages. As intraclass
correlation coefﬁcients (ICCs) between left and right gait
parameters were high, the mean of the left and right side
were calculated and used for analysis: base of support,
(ICC=0.961,
length
(ICC=0.972, paired t-test p=0.999), step time (ICC=0.923,

t-test p=0.425).

Neurocognitive data were scaled and one sample Stu-
dent’s t-tests (two-tailed) were used to determine whether
the children with NF1 were signiﬁcantly different from the
normative data. A one sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was used when the data were non-parametric. Pearson’s
rank correlation coefﬁcients were calculated to investigate
the relationship between motor function, gait, and execu-
tive function when both variables were continuous and the
assumption of normality was met. When the data were not
normally distributed (for the SWM Strategy variable only),
Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients were conducted.
Only the global executive composite from the BRIEF,
FSIQ, working memory index, and perceptual reasoning
index scores from the WISC-IV were included to limit the
number of correlations performed. Missing values were not
included in the correlation analysis. To control for type 1
error, the level of signiﬁcance was set at 0.01.

RESULTS
Our sample consisted of 46 children (20 females, 26
males), aged 7 to 17 years (mean age 11y 1mo, SD 3y
2mo; mean height 144.4cm, SD 17.4cm). Of these, 39 were
assessed using the BOT-2 subdomains of upper limb coor-
dination and balance. Thirty-eight children were assessed
on the running speed and agility domain. One child was
unable to complete this domain because of a prior appoint-
ment.

BOT-2 normalized scores are shown in Table I and
were signiﬁcantly lower than age-matched normative refer-
ence values. The majority of the study participants dis-
played at least ‘below average’ performance, with 28/39
falling below the 17th centile for balance and upper limb
coordination and 16/38 falling below the 17th centile for
running speed and agility. No study participant performed
at an ‘above average’ level (i.e. >84th centile) in the run-
ning speed and agility or upper limb coordination domains,

reductions

This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to report on
gait parameters in children with NF1. Age-related changes
in gait were similar to those described in typically devel-
oping children, with increasing velocity, step time, step
and stride length with decreasing cadence.27 However,
there were spatiotemporal gait variables that showed sig-
niﬁcant variations from those reported in typically devel-
oping children.37,39 Children with NF1 demonstrated
statistically signiﬁcant
in velocity, cadence,
stride length and single support (%GC), and an increased
double support (%GC) and step time, although the mean
z-score may not be clinically signiﬁcant as all but the
double and single support (%GC) parameters were within
1 SD of normative reference values. Such changes are
consistent with a cautious walking strategy to preserve
balance at the expense of velocity.40 An unexpected ﬁnd-
ing, however, was the tendency towards a narrowed base
of support (i.e. gait width), which requires increased fron-
tal plane stability and is not typically a compensation for
impaired balance.41 However, base of support is a measure
that should be treated with caution as it has been shown
to exhibit lower repeatability than other spatiotemporal
measures.26

the greatest associations with neurocognitive variables,
including the strategy score from the spatial working mem-
ory task, the working memory index, and the perceptual
reasoning index. There were also signiﬁcant associations
between balance and the perceptual reasoning index and
working memory index. Taken together, these associations
suggest that children with NF1 and neurocognitive impair-
ments – particularly working memory and non-verbal
reasoning deﬁcits – are more likely to experience reduced
motor abilities. Relationships between working memory
and motor abilities have been reported in children with
developmental coordination disorder,12,14 raising the possi-
bility of shared abnormal neurodevelopmental processes
underlying these abilities in children with NF1.

Signiﬁcant associations were also identiﬁed between neu-
rocognitive variables and the base of support (spatial work-
ing memory, strategy) and step length (strategy) measures
of gait. There are a number of possible explanations for
the association between gait and neurocognitive variables.
One suggests the possibility of cerebellar dysfunction, a
brain structure shown to be important in motor coordina-
tion, balance, and cognition, particularly executive func-
tions.15 However, the observed tendency of children with
NF1 to have a narrower base of support is inconsistent
with an impaired cerebellar mechanism.42 An alternate
hypothesis could be that abnormalities within the cortico-
striatal network, a circuit that intimately links regions of
frontal cortex to striatal structures via the thalamus and
globus pallidus,43 contributes to the association between
executive and motor impairments. Although it
is well
established that executive functions, such as working mem-
ory, are mediated by corticostriatal circuitry, recent data
(Nf1strain with GFAP+ cell
from Nf1 mice models
bi-allelic Nf1 gene inactivation) have established a mecha-
nistic connection between NF1 gene expression and
decreased dopamine levels in the striatum, thus strengthen-
ing this hypothesis.44 Interestingly, our cohort of children
with NF1 demonstrated a similar gait proﬁle to that seen
in early Parkinson disease; a disease associated with
decreased dorsal striatal dopamine levels and gait abnor-
malities which are characterized by a shorter step length
and longer step time, reduced cadence and base of support
and increased double support time.45 Although identifying

the cause of the combined motor/cognitive deﬁcits in NF1
is beyond the scope of this study, these ﬁndings add sup-
port to the body of evidence demonstrating comorbidity of
motor and cognitive deﬁcits in developmental disorders.

The present study is not without limitation and we
acknowledge that the simultaneous recruitment of an age-
matched healthy comparison group would have allowed for
a more thorough investigation of gait in the entire NF1
cohort and should be considered for future research inves-
tigating gait in NF1. The size of our cohort also restricted
the number of associations we could investigate between
cognition and motor function.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated motor and gait
impairments in children and adolescents with NF1. Con-
sidering that motor skill impairment can cause a multitude
of problems including engagement in school and sporting
activities and impaired processing and perceptual abilities,

future research should focus on interventions to improve
deﬁcits in this area. We have additionally identiﬁed a rela-
tionship between neurocognitive performance and running
speed and agility, balance and gait in children with NF1.
This relationship raises the possibility of a common patho-
genic pathway caused by abnormalities of dopamine-medi-
ated corticostriatal circuitry. We plan to further explore
the interdependency in motor and cognitive outcomes
using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and to exam-
ine neurocognitive and motor response to pharmacological
manipulation of the dopaminergic pathway.
