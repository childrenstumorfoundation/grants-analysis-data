Abstract Schwannomatosis is a clinical syndrome that
requires thorough clinical and radiological assessments
before the diagnosis is made. Although schwannomatosis
has been reported before, all were in multiple organ sites.
The authors report a case of multiple intra-dural schwan-
nomas of the conus medullaris expressing HIF-1, galectin-
3, cox-2 and Wilms tumor-1 protein; which to the best of
our knowledge has not been previously reported in
schwanomatosis.

Introduction

Schwannomatosis is a clinical syndrome that requires
thorough clinical and radiological assessments before the
diagnosis is made. In schwannomatosis, patients lack fea-
tures characteristic of neuroﬁbromatosis (NF) 2: bilateral
vestibular schwannomata, or family history of NF2 plus
unilateral acoustic neuroma or any two of meningioma,
glioma, neuroﬁbroma, schwannoma, posterior subcapsular
lenticular opacities. In addition, patients must also lack
features pathognomonic of NF1: cafe´ au lait patches, two
or more Lisch nodules of the iris, two or more neuroﬁ-
bromata or one plexiform neuroﬁbroma or a ﬁrst degree

relative with NF1 [1, 2]. The diagnostic criteria for sch-
wannomatosis are listed in Table 1 [1]. Extensive work has
been carried out to either link or separate the clinically
distinct Schwannomatosis from Neuroﬁbromatosis [3–5].

Multiple spinal Schwannommatosis account for 5% of
all spinal tumours, occur most frequently in the cervical
region, followed by the lumbo-sacral and lastly the thor-
aco-lumbar regions [5–7]. The tumours usually arise from
the Schwann cells of the neurilemma of spinal nerve roots
hence, the term neurilemmoma or schwannoma. Classi-
cally, schwannomas are extra-dural which grow and
expand the intervertebral foramen. There have been reports
of intra-dural and even intra-medullary schwannomas [8].
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription
factor that respond to hypoxia. The alpha subunit of HIF-1
is a target for prolyl hydroxylation by HIF prolyl-hydrox-
ylase, which makes HIF-1 a a target for degradation by the
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to quick degradation
by the proteasome. This occurs only in normoxic condi-
tions. In hypoxic conditions, HIF prolyl-hydroxylase is
inhibited, since it utilizes oxygen as a cosubstrate. HIF-1,
when stabilized by hypoxic conditions upregulates several
genes to promote survival in low-oxygen conditions [9].
Galectin-3, a glycoprotein with a 31-kDa molecular weight,
is a member of the beta-galactoside binding family of lec-
tins [10]. It has been suggested to play a role in a variety of
biological processes such as cell growth, cellular adhesion,
cell cycle regulation, neoplastic transformation and metas-
tasis [10]. Cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), an inducible enzyme
pivotal in the inﬂammatory response, converts arachidonic
acid to the prostaglandins required to initiate and maintain
reactions during the inﬂammatory process. HIF-1 a up-
regulation occurred in cox-2-overexpression [11].

Wilm’s tumor-1 (WT-1), a well characterized tumor
suppressor gene, was shown to be a transcriptional

The authors present a rare case of four intra-dural sch-
wannomas localised to the T12-L2 region of the spinal cord
expressing HIF-1, galectin-3, cox-2 and Wilms tumor-1
protein; which to the best of our knowledge has not been
previously reported in schwanomatosis.

Case report

A 46 year-old male presented with 9 months of non-speciﬁc
lower back pain. As part of the investigation process for the
low back pain he underwent a magnetic resonance image
(MRI) scan. This revealed intradural space occupying
lesions in the thoraco-lumbar region. He was referred
immediately to the neurosurgical department. System
inquiry failed to reveal any other abnormalities in his
present and past medical history. There was no family his-
tory of cutaneous lesions, eye pathology or brain tumours.
On examination there was only mild hypoesthesia in the left
L2 & L3 distribution and mild wasting of the left quadriceps
muscle. No cafe´ au lait patches or visual abnormalities were
detected on clinical examination. Of note the patient had a
scaphocephaly with average intelligence.

MRI scan of the lumbar and thoracic region showed
three intradural extramedullary lesion that were hyperin-
tense on T2 and hypo-intense on T1 and enhanced vividly
and homogenously (Fig. 1). The lesions varied in size and
extended from the level of the T12 exit foramen to the level
of L2 body. The conus medullaris and cauda equine
seemed to be pushed to the right side. A non-enhanced
brain and cervical ? thoracic MRI was performed to look
for any other lesions. None were found.

The patient underwent initially a lumbar puncture for
cytology but that was negative for abnormal cells. Three
days later the patient underwent T12-L2 laminoplasty and
total resection of four intradural extra-medullary lesions
under intra-operative electromyographic monitoring. All

four lesions were ‘‘encapsulated’’, ﬁrm and attached to
spinal nerve roots; T12 bilaterally, left L1 and Right L2.
The T12 tumours were both fusiform and the other two
globular in shape. Incision of the ‘‘capsule’’ and tumour
debulking followed by excision of the capsule and caute-
rising its attachment to the spinal nerve root was utilised to
resect the upper three lesions. The fourth was resected en-
bloc after dissecting it free from its attachment to the right
L2 nerve root. The patient suffered no neurological deﬁcits
post-operatively. The tumour capsules were sequentially
dissected free from nerve roots then excised en bloc and the
attachment to the nerve root cauterised with bipolar dia-
thermy. No nerve roots were sacriﬁced.

Histologically, the tumour was composed of spindle to
ovoid cells with ovoid or angulated nuclei closely arrayed
in intermingled bundles with hyper and hypocellular areas
(Fig. 2a). The hyper cellular areas composed of spindle

The cells of the examined tissue were phenotyped

using antibodies (DAKO) all diluted to 1:50. The tumor
cells were uniformly S100 (Fig. 2c), HHF35 (Fig. 2d),

tive. The tumor cells showed no immunoreactivity to
epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, desmin, smooth
muscle actin, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein, HMB-45 and
synaptophysin.

Post-operatively the patient had no added neurological
deﬁcits and was mobilised on day four post-operatively. A

thoraco-lumbar area pre-and post Gadolinium showed two
tiny spots of enhancement at the level of the T12 nerve
roots corresponding to the area of attachment of the
tumours. No other abnormal intra-dural enhancement was
seen. The patient was discharged on day 12 postopera-
tively, fully independent and self-caring. A ﬁrm thoraco-
lumbar brace was applied for 6 weeks.

Discussion

Guidelines for the diagnosis of Schwannomatosis were
proposed by MacCollin et al. in 2005 [1] based on the
largest combined patient cohorts presenting with features
of non-NF neurilemmoma. The typical age of presentation
is over 30 years. Symptoms range from non-speciﬁc
regional pain to neurologic deﬁcit due to neural compro-
mise. The radiological
investigation of choice is MRI
scanning which should typically cover the whole neural

axis. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice
and is associated with long-term tumour free survival. The
rationale of complete surgical excision (which usually
entails resection of the harbouring nerve root) as opposed
to enucleation within the capsule has been resolved
recently. Kuo et al. [13] described the light microscopic
features of ten acoustic schwannomata and concluded that
there is no true capsule. Hasegawa and co-workers [14]
further conﬁrmed these ﬁndings studying spinal schwan-
nomas capsules under
the electron microscope. They
concluded that there is an intermix of nerve ﬁbres and
tumour tissue within a so called capsule therefore, enu-
cleation retains the risk of recurrence, but may provide a
better functional outcome, especially with the use micro-
scopic surgery. In our case the patient had total resection of
all four lesions with a nerve sparing technique.

The clinical differential diagnoses include ependymoma
and metastatic carcinoma. Ependymoma is usually intra-
medullary single lesion which can be easily differentiated
from schwannoma by histologic examination. Moreover,
metastatic carcinoma can be differentiated by histologic
examination too.
Immunohistochemical examination is
helpful
since
schwannoma is usually immunoreactive to S100 which is
usually negative in ependymoma and metastatic carcinoma
while epithelial markers are positive in metastatic carci-
noma. In addition, ependymoma shows immunoreactivity
to glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein which is negative in
schwannoma.

in solving the differential diagnosis

The expression of HIF-1, galectin-3, cox-2 and Wilms
tumor-1 protein in neoplastic cells of present neoplasms is
highly interesting and suggest a possible role in their
development. In the present case, the neoplastic cells show
cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for HIF-1. HIF-1 is a tran-
scription factor composed of HIF-1a which dimerize with a
constitutively expressed b subunit and subsequently bind to
hypoxia response elements in the promoters of target genes
[9]. HIF-1a protein expression in cells is regulated by a
variety of stimuli, including changes in cellular oxygen
concentration, growth factors, oncogenic activation, or loss
of tumor suppressor function. Under normal oxygen ten-
sion, the a subunits are hydroxylated at conserved prolyl
and asparaginyl residues and are targeted for degradation
by the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin E3 ligase
complex. In hypoxia, inhibition of hydroxylation results in
stabilization of HIF-1a and leads to transcriptional activa-
tion of target genes [15]. Loss or inactivation of the tumor
suppressor VHL leads to accumulation of HIF in schwann
cells and drives the production of various hypoxia induc-
ible mRNAs including the mRNAs encoding vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth
factor B (PDGF B), erythropoietin (EPO), galectin-3, WT-
1 protein, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa).

VEGF and PDGF B are paracrine growth factors that
stimulate endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and
leading to vascular proliferation and proliferation of
schwann cells hence, growth of the neoplasm [15]. It is
noteworthy to mention here that there are multiple foci of
vascular proliferation in the current neoplasms. In addition,
the neoplastic cells show strong and diffuse nuclear and
cytoplasmic
staining for galectin-3 suggesting over
expression of galectin-3 gene. Up-regulation of galectin-3
gene is mediated predominantly by HIF-1a [9]. Zeng et al.,
demonstrates that HIF-1 regulates galectin-3 expression by
interacting with hypoxia regulatory elements in the pro-
moter region [16]. Galectin-3 over expression inhibits
apoptosis and may promote neoplastic transformation of
schwann cells [10].

Moreover,

the neoplastic cells

show cytoplasmic
immunostaining for cox-2. HIF-1a up-regulation occurred
in cox-2 over expression [11]. Both cox-2 and HIF-1 up-
regulation promote vascular proliferation and tumor
growth.

Furthermore,

the neoplastic cells show diffuse and
strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for WT-1 protein
suggesting over expression of WT-1 gene. Over expres-
sion of WT-1 protein in schwann cells is possibly due to
the autocrine effect of HIF-1 which activates the tran-
scription of WT-1 gene [15]. WT-1 protein is a
transcriptional
target genes
including those for growth factors and regulators of cell
division [12]. We believe that the expression of HIF-1,
galectin-3, cox-2 and Wilms tumor-1 protein in neoplastic
cells may be essential for the development of schw-
anomatosis in our case.

regulator with putative

Recurrence or developing new tumours on follow up
may occur [5]. However, there is no recurrence in our cases
after 1 year of follow-up. Some patients show a familial
tendency though the genetic coding does not show NF2
typical mutations [17]. Some reports advocate the use of
adjunct post-operative radiotherapy or radiosurgery, but
not in the case of completely excised lesions [18]. Post-
operative radiotherapy is planned 3 months postoperatively
after healing of the laminoplasty for this patient.

Conclusion

Schwannomatosis is as yet, a clinical syndrome, which
requires thorough clinical and radiological assessments
before making the diagnosis. The long term prognosis
appears to be good and recurrence after total surgical
excision is uncommon. The expression of HIF-1, galec-
tin-3, cox-2 and Wilms tumor-1 protein in neoplastic
cells may
be
of
schwanomatosis.
