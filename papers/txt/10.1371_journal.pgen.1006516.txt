Abstract

Although gene-gene interaction, or epistasis, plays a large role in complex traits in model
organisms, genome-wide by genome-wide searches for two-way interaction have limited
power in human studies. We thus used knowledge of a biological pathway in order to identify
a contribution of epistasis to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans, a reverse-path-
way genetic approach. Based on previous observation of increased ASD symptoms in Men-
delian disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway (RASopathies), we showed that common SNPs
in RASopathy genes show enrichment for association signal in GWAS (P = 0.02). We then
screened genome-wide for interactors with RASopathy gene SNPs and showed strong
enrichment in ASD-affected individuals (P < 2.2 x 10−16), with a number of pairwise interac-
tions meeting genome-wide criteria for significance. Finally, we utilized quantitative mea-
sures of ASD symptoms in RASopathy-affected individuals to perform modifier mapping via
GWAS. One top region overlapped between these independent approaches, and we
showed dysregulation of a gene in this region, GPR141, in a RASopathy neural cell line. We
thus used orthogonal approaches to provide strong evidence for a contribution of epistasis
to ASDs, confirm a role for the Ras/MAPK pathway in idiopathic ASDs, and to identify a con-
vergent candidate gene that may interact with the Ras/MAPK pathway.

Author Summary

The contribution of epistasis to human biology and complex trait architecture has been
subject to intense debate. Despite statistical methods to detect interaction, allele frequen-
cies and study designs have limited our power to address this question. Rather than a sta-
tistically-motivated approach, we developed a reverse pathway genetic approach to detect

Epistasis in ASD

epistasis in in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Instead of traditional pathway analysis
—exploiting unbiased genetic results to identify biological pathways important for patho-
physiology—we hypothesized that the reverse approach of leveraging a specific biological
pathway to uncover novel aspects of genetic architecture could be fruitful. We drew on
knowledge from Mendelian disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway (RASopathies) associ-
ated with ASD to inform our analyses. First, we implemented an epistasis screen in idio-
pathic ASD for SNPs that interact with the Ras/MAPK pathway, allowing us to detect
genome-wide enrichment in epistasis signal as well as specific interacting loci. Second, we
performed modifier mapping within RASopathies and identified overlapping signals with
our first approach. Finally, we took the top overlapping region and experimentally dem-
onstrated dysregulated expression in iPSC-derived neural cells from RASopathy subjects.
Together, our results establish a human genetics motivated reverse-pathway strategy,
which can be applied broadly to study epistasis.

Introduction
Common polymorphisms may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease
beyond additive effects

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common polymorphism association with com-
plex neuropsychiatric traits have yielded recent success mapping single nucleotide risk poly-
morphisms with modest additive effects, particularly in schizophrenia[1]. However,
complementary approaches utilizing the same data support an even greater role for common
polymorphism in complex heritable disorders like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disor-
ders (ASDs) than explained by the identified additive effects. For example, analysis in schizo-
phrenia and other traits suggests that heritability is not completely accounted for by common
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in models inconsistent with contribution primarily
from rare SNPs, suggesting that genetic interaction could account for some of the additional
contribution of common variation[2,3]. Recent studies in ASDs estimate similarly large contri-
bution of common variants to ASD liability despite inability to identify specific highly signifi-
cant SNPs[4–6]. The modest effect sizes of individual SNP associations observed to date match
expectation based on severe mating and fecundity reduction in schizophrenia and ASDs, how-
ever selective pressure could allow for stronger effects of gene-gene interaction, or epistasis
[7,8].

Epistasis is a pervasive genetic mechanism

Studies of complex traits in mice and in fruit flies have revealed modest main effects and fre-
quency distributions similar to those identified in human GWAS[9]. However, careful study
design and leverage of inbreeding have proven that epistasis typically accounts for a majority
of the variation in quantitative traits[10–15]. Human GWAS studies have had limited success
identifying genetic interactions, although model organism and theoretical evidence suggests
that such effects are likely to be important[16]. Several limitations in human studies could
account for this. First, power is extremely limited for genome-wide by genome-wide explora-
tion of interaction, due to the potential number of even two-way tests to perform, requiring
‘astronomical’ sample sizes to even begin to address. Second, epistatic variance depends on
both the size of genetic effects and the allele frequencies. Alleles with strong functional effects
(such as those causing highly penetrant disease) may be more likely to show epistasis, but also

Epistasis in ASD

be rare in the population. Therefore, in order to explore epistasis in humans, we wanted to
take advantage of known rare, functional variation that can contribute to symptoms of com-
plex disease[17].

Mendelian disease genes contribute to common traits

Emerging evidence suggests that Mendelian diseases (high penetrance, dominant/recessive
inheritance) resembling complex disorders may affect the same genes showing common risk
variation in the population. There has been longstanding skepticism that similar phenotypes
with simple and complex genetic inheritance share biological etiology, however, powerful
recent study designs have revealed strong overlap. In Type II Diabetes, at least four of the first
20 genes shown robustly to be associated with the common adult-onset form were previously
identified as causes of Mendelian forms[18]. Moreover, comprehensive analysis of medical
records suggests widespread pleiotropy such that strong associations have been identified
between single-gene Mendelian conditions and complex heritable traits; these specific associa-
tions are reflected in enrichment of GWAS SNP associations at the implicated Mendelian loci
and increased replication at these loci compared with other GWAS-associated SNPs[19]. Fur-
ther, this study indicated that these inferred genetic variants often act in a non-additive combi-
natorial model for certain disorders, including ASDs[19]. Despite strong evidence for
association, many single-gene disorders display variation in penetrance or expression of asso-
ciated complex phenotypes, i.e. reduced penetrance for these traits compared with primary
features of Mendelian disease. One theory posits that background common genetic variation
could modify risk for complex disease symptoms in the presence of a Mendelian disease. A
notable example is autosomal recessive cystic fibrosis (CF), in which a combination of early
gene identification (CFTR), common primary mutation (delta F508), frequency (1/3500 in the
United States) and familial inheritance have enabled modifier mapping studies[20]. Many var-
iable features of CF influence morbidity and mortality, including lung, liver, intestine, and
pancreatic manifestations. Interestingly, in several examples so far, modifier loci in CF overlap
with common complex traits[21]. TGFB1 SNPs are associated with CF pulmonary function
and with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population[22,23].
TCF7L2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 and several other susceptibility loci for type 2
diabetes in the general population are also associated with high risk for CF-related diabetes
[24]. Here, we can consider an independent SNP with large effect size in the presence of a
Mendelian mutation (but modest effect size in the general population) to be equivalent to
gene-gene interaction. One locus is known to be present due to affection with a monogenic
disease, and the other is to be identified by modifier mapping. Thus, the active biological path-
ways involved in complex disease can be powerfully identified in studies with ascertainment
for Mendelian conditions.

ASDs are associated with Mendelian disorders of the Ras/MAPK
pathway

ASDs are diagnosed based on core deficits in social reciprocity and communication as well as
presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. These traits have also
been long associated with a range of genetically simpler disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome,
tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, and Turner syndrome[25]. We hypothesized that Mende-
lian disorders associated with variable expression of ASD symptoms would be the optimal ave-
nue for identification of gene-gene interaction. At the same time, specific study of natural
variation in neurogenetic networks for behavioral traits in other organisms suggested a shift
from considering single genes to pathway-based approaches[26]. Similarly, biological network

knowledge has been proposed to enhance detection of epistasis[27–29]. We reasoned that a
biologically informed network approach, showing promise in Crohn’s disease, bipolar disor-
der, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis, may also illuminate ASD genetics[30,31]. Hence,
instead of a single Mendelian disease, we chose to focus on a set of syndromes caused by muta-
tions tightly intertwined in a single well-defined signaling pathway.

Disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway (commonly referred to as RASopathies)[32] are ideal
to study for identification of gene-gene interaction in ASD. Ras is a small GTPase with critical
signaling functions in the cell, including the MAPK signaling cascade. Although best-known
for its role in cancer due to acquired somatic mutations, dysregulation of genes in the Ras/
MAPK pathway in human development causes disorders including neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1: NF1[33]), Noonan syndrome and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines[34] (NS:
CBL[35], BRAF, KRAS[36], LZTR1[37], NRAS[38,39], PTPN11[40], RAF1[41], RASA2[42],
RIT1[43], SHOC2[44–46], SOS1[47,48], and SOS2[37]), Gingival fibromatosis 1 (SOS1[49,50]),
Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) (RASA1[51,52]), Costello
syndrome (CS: HRAS[53]), Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC[54]: BRAF,MAP2K1,
MAP2K2, KRAS), and NF1-like syndrome (SPRED1[55]). Many of these syndromes share cra-
niofacial dysmorphology, cardiac malformations and cutaneous, musculoskeletal and ocular
abnormalities. We have recently studied four RASopathies (NF1, NS, CS, and CFC) and found
association with both threshold measures correlated with clinical ASD diagnosis and quantita-
tive ASD trait measures[56]. Our phenotype analyses suggested additional similarities with idi-
opathic ASDs, such as a male-biased sex ratio. Other groups have performed independent
studies with highly consistent findings[57–62]. Studying multiple disorders in the same biolog-
ical pathway could therefore both increase the power of our study and increase the likelihood
of results translating to an even broader diagnostic category, idiopathic ASDs.

Independent ‘reverse pathway analysis’ approaches

Instead of traditional pathway analysis—taking advantage of unbiased genetic analysis results
to identify biological pathways important for disease pathophysiology—we hypothesized that
the reverse approach of utilizing a specific biological pathway to uncover novel aspects of
genetic architecture could be fruitful. In particular, we sought to overcome the limited power
of genome-wide screens for two-way epistasis and the modest effects anticipated for common
polymorphisms in complex disease. Thus, we designed two orthogonal approaches to leverage
a well-defined biological pathway in order to learn more about gene-gene interaction in ASDs.
1) We performed a genetic screen for epistasis in idiopathic ASD subjects searching genome-
wide for interaction partners of common polymorphisms in the Ras/MAPK pathway genes,
thereby limiting one side of the pairwise test to include only polymorphisms relevant to a
small number of RASopathy genes; 2) In parallel, we mapped SNPs influencing a quantitative
measure of social responsiveness in RASopathy subjects ascertained for rare, major effect
mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway. In the latter case, the autosomal dominant RASopathy
mutation is one locus, and the second locus involved in interaction will be identified by
genome-wide SNP-based QTL mapping. We used these complementary approaches to show
that ‘reverse pathway’ screening is a feasible approach to identify epistasis relevant to a com-
plex heritable trait.

Simplex Collection (SSC)] in addition to in-house generated data [University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF)], all of which were comprised of family trios with one affected offspring
and both parents. We performed a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) for ASD associa-
tion in our final dataset of 4,109 trios. We first performed set-based analysis for polymor-
phisms within 5kb of each of the known RASopathy genes in the Ras/MAPK pathway (S1
Table). Then, we compared the proportion of SNPs exceeding a false discovery rate (FDR)
threshold of q = 0.2 to permutations using length-matched random gene sets, showing that
common polymorphisms within Ras/MAPK genes are significantly enriched for association
with idiopathic ASDs (P = 0.02) (Fig 1). This evidence for main effects of Ras/MAPK polymor-
phism in ASDs supports our rationale for testing epistasis involving Ras/MAPK SNPs.

Epistasis with Ras/MAPK polymorphisms in ASD subjects

We next performed ‘set-by-all’ tests for two-way genetic interactions with polymorphisms in
the Ras/MAPK SNP set (S1 Table). This is performed by testing each polymorphism in the
Ras/MAPK SNP set (SNP 1) for correlation with any other polymorphism (on an unlinked
autosome) across the genome (SNP 2) in cases with ASDs. SNP1-SNP2 correlation across
independent chromosomes in a genetically homogeneous population is considered evidence
for epistasis contributing to disease risk. We calculated a genome-wide significance threshold

(P = 7.6x10-10) accounting for multiple LD groups per Ras/MAPK gene and the proportion of
the genome tested for each genome-wide epistasis screen (see S2 Table). At this threshold, 569
SNP pairs representing 19 independent region pairs showed epistasis in cases, which was sig-
nificantly increased compared with matched pseudo-controls (OR 3.1, P < 2.2x10-16). We
observed an excess of association at several additional P-value thresholds in this analysis in
ASD cases compared with matched pseudo-controls (P < 2.2x10-16) (Table 1, Fig 2). We also
identified individual epistasis signals surpassing a gene-based significance threshold set by
dividing the GWAS significance threshold (P = 5.0x10-8) by the number of genes in the
Ras/MAPK set for an approximate independent hypothesis-testing estimate (P = 2.9x10-9)
considering all SNPs in a single gene part of the same hypothesis (i.e. LD-independent SNPs
relevant to the same gene considered non-biologically independent due to potentially similar
functional consequences) (Table 1, S1A–S1F Fig). The data underlying these results show that
the primary driving genotype-combination category is double-heterozygotes, which shows
dramatic increase compared with expected counts in cases, but similar to expected counts in
pseudo-controls (S3 Table). This would be expected for minor allele interactions increasing
risk, as most combinations including minor allele homozygotes have very low counts.

We performed a number of negative and positive control analyses in order to exclude any
bias or artifact. For our first negative control, we performed similar set-by-all epistasis testing
for a permuted SNP set (median result in the main effect enrichment analysis above). In testing
for epistasis enrichment for a non-candidate pathway-selected set, we do not observe enrich-
ment of epistasis results in cases compared to pseudo-controls at our top significance thresh-
olds (OR < 1) (S2 Fig). Second, for our observed Ras/MAPK results above, we not only
compared a pseudo-control correlation approach (as above; in Table 1 all 41 top SNP pairs
show different OR between cases and pseudo-controls P < 0.05), but also used matched-sex
parent controls, which provided similar results to pseudo-controls (no epistasis P < 10−6 for
SNP pairs in Table 1; significant overrepresentation genome-wide in cases at all P-value
thresholds considered from P < 10−6 to P < 7.6 10−10). As a positive control, we selected the
small homogeneous set of cases and matched unaffected siblings from unique families
(N = 1,136) from the SSC dataset, and similarly to pseudo-controls, we observed significant
epistasis enrichment in cases and diminishing odds ratios at varying P-value thresholds down
to P < 10−6 (S3 Fig). Finally, we validated the top results (P < 1.0x10-6) with the trio correla-
tion test for epistasis. This independent method had highly correlated P-values with the case-
only approach, suggesting the results are consistent with epistasis and not marginal effects
(rho = 0.78, P< 2.2x10-16). We observed that all results from the PLINK[63,64] case-only epis-
tasis analysis with P< 1.0x10-6 also had P< 4.4x10-5 in the trio correlation test, thereby con-
firming the results with an independent method (S4 Fig).

Mapping of an ASD-related quantitative trait in RASopathy subjects

In order to utilize a separate approach to assess evidence for multiple genetic hits contributing
to ASD symptoms, we ascertained individuals for having a RASopathy (NF1, NS, CS, and
CFC). Although these individuals have a dominant germline mutation in the Ras/MAPK path-
way causing some highly penetrant features, we have previously shown that ASD symptoms
are variable both across and within disorders[56]. Thus, we performed a modifier screen via
genome-wide association based on a quantitative social responsiveness trait, measured by the
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (S5 Fig). The SRS is a questionnaire measure with normally
distributed and highly heritable scores in the general population strongly reflective of clinical
ASDs[65]. Thus, identifying modifiers of an ASD-related trait in individuals ascertained for a
RASopathy could identify interactors with the Ras/MAPK pathway relevant to ASDs, as we

consider the RASopathy locus and the modifier locus interacting to influence the ASD-rele-
vant trait. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping within-disorder and meta-
analysis across the four disorders, as well as QTL mapping in sibling controls. We did not
observe any SNPs meeting criteria for genome-wide significance (P = 5.0x10-8), however, the

Epistasis in ASD

Fig 2. Comparison of number of Ras/MAPK gene epistasis results in ASD cases versus pseudo-
controls. The graph displays number of epistasis tests (y-axis) in the ASD cases (dark gray, circle) and
ASD pseudo-controls (light gray, triangle) with P-value thresholds (x-axis, left to right): P < 2.9x10-9,
< 1.0x10-8, P < 1.0x10-7, P < 1.0x10-6, P < 1.0x10-5, and P < 1.0x10-4. The 2x2 chi-square test P-value and
odds ratio (OR) are included for the epistasis results meeting nominal significance (P < 10−6).

most significant SNP in this QTL analysis (rs62621010, P = 5.6x10-7, Table 2) is 0.39 Mb from
the locus with the second-most significant epistasis signal in ASDs (rs114490548, Table 1). The
rs62621010 putative modifier SNP does not show evidence for association with SRS in sibling
controls. The region flanking and between rs62621010 and rs114490548 (chr7:37,749,392–
38,139,570) contains genes ELMO1, GPR141, NME8, SFRP4, EPDR1, and STARD3NL. The two
SNPs have low LD in 1000genomes measured by r2, although there is high D’ variably across
the region (Fig 3). Neither SNP is represented in both ASD and RASopathy datasets (or can be
imputed) for direct comparison.

Expression dysregulation in RASopathy neural cell lines

For prioritization of genes within the top region jointly identified by epistasis analysis in idio-
pathic ASDs and QTL-mapping in RASopathy subjects, we assessed expression level of genes
in the chromosome 7 region in RASopathy neural cell lines. Our reasoning was that if a RASo-
pathy mutation resulted in expression dysregulation of a gene, it provides strong biological
plausibility for interaction with Ras/MAPK signaling. We utilized qRT-PCR to compare RNA
extracted from CFC (BRAF c.770A>G, p.Q257R) patient-derived iPSC neural cell cultures
(5 weeks) and compared to control-derived matched cultures[66]. All cultures were positive

Table 2. Social responsiveness association in RASopathy top results. The independent SNPs with social responsiveness score (SRS) association in
RASopathy (random effects meta-analysis P < 1.0x10-4) are listed. The data underlying the top six candidate modifiers are graphically illustrated in S6 Fig. For
each SNP, the following is listed in order of columns: SNP rsID, chromosome (CHR), position (BP, reference version hg19), minor allele frequency in the data-
set (MAF), groups contributing to the RASopathy association (group with the most significant association P-value is listed first and groups with similar direction
of effect are in parentheses), Cochran’s Q P-value for all four RASopathy groups, RASopathy (CFC, CS, NF1, and NS) SRS association (random effects
meta-analysis) P-value, control sibling SRS P-value (linear regression), gene(s) containing or flanking SNP.

significantly downregulated (P = 0.04, S5 Table, Fig 4). GPR141 encodes a brain-expressed
orphan g-protein coupled receptor in the rhodopsin family.

Discussion

We find the results of this reverse-pathway genetic study compelling for a number of reasons.
We limit one side of a two-way interaction test to a relevant genetic pathway, and obtain
genome-wide enrichment for epistasis in a common, complex human disease. Further, specific
epistasis results survive independent genome-wide or gene-by-genome multiple testing correc-
tion, and reside near compelling candidate loci. Our second approach of modifier mapping for
a relevant quantitative trait in subjects with Mendelian disorders in the same pathway, RASo-
pathies, converges on several regions overlapping the ASD epistasis results. A gene in the top
overlapping region across analyses showed expression dysregulation in neural cell lines from
RASopathy subjects. Together, our results from each step of this study suggest we have identi-
fied powerful approaches to unravel complex genetic mechanisms.

First, in a reverse pathway-driven approach, we obtained strong evidence for gene-gene

interaction in a human complex trait. We have previously used candidate-pair approaches to
find interaction effects in ASDs, which have been independently replicated and shown to have

a functional basis[67–71], and other studies have performed epistasis screens limiting all dis-
covery to a candidate set or pathway[72–76]. However, our set-by-genome strategy can not
only identify novel disease-relevant biological relationships, but this study also directly shows
a genome-wide excess of epistasis signal in human disease (P < 2.2 x 10−16), achieved by

constraining the set of interaction partners based on biological and genetic knowledge. The
approach we have used here is in principle straightforward and could be applied to other disor-
ders or pathways.

Beyond global enrichment for epistasis in ASDs, we identified specific loci meeting criteria

for gene-based or genome-wide significance considering the number of Ras/MAPK genes or
LD groups for which genome-wide screening was performed (P < 2.9 x 10−9; P < 7.6 x 10−10).
Loci identified to be putative Ras/MAPK interaction partners influencing ASD risk in this way
include or are adjacent to some already strong ASD candidate genes. GRM7 has been identi-
fied in rare, de novo CNV deletions[77,78] and single nucleotide mutations[79] in subjects
with ASD and in a candidate gene SNP study. It encodes a metabotropic glutamate receptor
critical for early development[80]. KIRREL3 has likewise been implicated by rare genetic dis-
ruptions[81–84] and inclusion in expression networks of common polymorphism association
[85], as well as mouse behavioral anomalies[86]. It is thought to be key for synaptogenesis.
NIPA2 and CYFIP1 are located on 15q11.2 in the region affected by an interstitial microdupli-
cation syndrome associated with ASDs[87,88]. PCDH9, PITX, REEP3, NBEA, and OPRM1 are
additional ASD candidate genes listed in SFARIgene[89] (see web resources).

Similarly, several genes implicated by this epistasis analysis are specifically relevant to the

Ras/MAPK pathway. SPRY1 encodes a classic inhibitor of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and plays a
critical role in determining the balance between proliferation and differentiation for cortical
patterning and cerebellar development[90–92]. DCC encodes the receptor deleted in colorectal
cancer (DCC), which recruits proteins to promote axon outgrowth and guidance during
neurodevelopment, and has been shown to interact with a Ras inhibitor[93]. GATA3 is a tran-
scription factor known for its role in T-cell development, however it also helps to control
excitatory/inhibitory balance by determining GABAergic vs. glutamatergic fates during neuro-
development[94]. Ras/MAPK signaling can regulate the stability of GATA3 post-transcrip-
tionally by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway[95]. GHRHR encodes the growth
hormone releasing hormone receptor which can activate Ras/MAPK signaling[96].

Second, our results are in line with the previous prediction that not only would non-addi-

tive effects be a major contributor to ASDs, but also that Mendelian syndromic genes are likely
to be enriched for main effects[19]. We observe enrichment of additive association signal for
common polymorphisms near the Ras/MAPK genes, supporting traditional pathway analyses
that have identified this pathway as a major contributor to ASDs and indicating general over-
lap in biological etiology between Mendelian and complex traits [97–99]. In addition, our
results in idiopathic ASD SNP datasets strongly support our findings in rare RASopathies.
One of the highly significant epistasis loci is near the top result (albeit non genome-wide sig-
nificant) in a QTL modifier mapping approach in RASopathy subjects. A gene in this region,
GPR141, demonstrates reproducibly reduced expression in RASopathy neural cell lines.
Although this is merely circumstantial with regards to the observed epistasis and QTL results,
it provides biological plausibility for interaction with the Ras/MAPK pathway.

The function of GPR141, an orphan g-coupled protein receptor, is currently unknown.

Sequence-structure based phylogeny suggests potential ligand association with N-arachidonyl-
glycine (NAGly)[100]. The well-studied GPR18 in this class has been shown to mediate con-
centration-dependent phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in the presence of NAGly[101]. NAGly is
known to be anti-nociceptive and is thought to reversibly inhibit calcium currents in sensory
neurons and have additional minor effects on sodium currents[102]. Further experimentation
specific to GPR141 would be necessary to speculate about its potential interaction with the
Ras/MAPK pathway or functional role in ASDs. A second gene in the region, SFRP4, showed
nominal reduced expression in our first experiment and non-significant but consistent expres-
sion reduction in the second experiment. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is an

antagonist for Wnt ligands, inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Based on both
linkage disequilibrium in the region and our experimental results, we cannot rule out that
there are two separate loci or genes of interest relevant to ASD traits and Ras/MAPK signaling
within this region of chromosome 7 that are proximal but do not represent overlap across
analyses.

In addition, two other noteworthy loci (one between KIRREL3 and ETS1, the other between
GATA3 and CELF2) overlap between top results from ASD epistasis and RASopathy modifier
mapping and contain genes of particular interest. KIRREL3 is a strong ASD candidate gene, as
described above, and ETS1 encodes an effector of Ras/MAPK signaling mediating cell migra-
tion and transcriptional activation expressed in astrocytes[103,104]. GATA3 encodes a known
Ras/MAPK interactor, as described above, and CELF2 encodes CUGBP[105], Elav-like family
member 2, a fetal and adult brain expressed regulator of alternative splicing also likely to be
involved in mRNA editing and translation. Together, these loci overlapping with significant
ASD epistasis results suggest that studying rare Mendelian disorders associated with symptoms
of complex traits is a highly effective and relevant study design.

Further, some of the top results in the RASopathy modifier screen, although not meeting
criteria for genome-wide significance, are within or adjacent to previously implicated ASD
candidate genes. MACROD2 has been identified near a GWAS association, shown to be associ-
ated with ASD traits in the general population, and described as part of the gene expression
network of an independent ASD GWAS locus[106–108]. In addition, the MACROD2 locus
has been identified as associated with temporal lobe volume[109]. Likewise, CDH10 was ini-
tially located near a GWAS association[110]. RBFOX1 (or A2BP1) has been identified as dis-
rupted by rare translocation or CNV in ASDs[111–113]. The encoded protein (FOX1)
controls alternative splicing and transcription[114], including many other ASD candidate
genes, and is thought to be a key regulator of neurodevelopment[115]. DISC1, known for iden-
tification via rare structural variant in schizophrenia, has also been associated with ASDs
[78,112,116,117]. Additional genes listed in SFARIgene[89] adjacent to our top RASopathy
social responsiveness QTL results include CNTN5, ESRRB, GABRB1, GNB1L, and ICA1.

Some clear Ras/MAPK related genes contain or are adjacent to top RASopathy modifier

SNPs, as well. Primary RASopathy gene SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the pathway;
MAP3K2 encodes MEK kinase 2; RAPGEF2 encodes a Ras activator thought to control devel-
opmental neuronal migration in the cortex and formation of the corpus callosum[118,119].
ELK3 encodes a transcription factor downstream of Ras/MAPK signaling; ETS1 and GATA3
are additional transcription factors with demonstrated relationships to Ras/MAPK signaling
described above[120,121]. It is striking that the modifier-mapping approach in subjects ascer-
tained for Mendelian disease appears to contain many plausible loci despite the small sample
size compared with modern GWAS designs for case-control studies. However, it should be
noted that proximity between a SNP and gene does not indicate a functional relationship, so
further information would be needed to directly relate our identified loci from any analyses in
this study to specific genes listed in tables or discussed here.

In summary, we have used a variety of approaches under a reverse pathway tactic of defin-

ing a relevant biological pathway and leveraging it to study a proposed genetic mechanism.
In this case, we chose a pathway of interest based on human Mendelian disorders with over-
lapping symptoms shared by a genetically complex trait. Together, our strategies were suc-
cessful in validating a role for the Ras/MAPK pathway in idiopathic ASDs, demonstrating
highly significant enrichment for epistasis in ASDs, and identifying specific candidate loci
interacting with the Ras/MAPK pathway pertinent to symptoms of ASDs. Our experimental
data confirmed expression dysregulation of a gene within a convergently identified locus in

RASopathy-specific neural cell lines. Future studies would be useful to follow up additional
candidates identified by these approaches or extensions of them.

Materials and Methods
ASD datasets

ASD genotype data sets were collected from multiple sources. We obtained previously pub-
lished genotype data as study investigators (UCSF-Weiss) or by application to AGRE, SSC,
and dbGAP (AGP). Genotyping of each dataset was previously performed on Illumina or Affy-
metrix genotyping arrays as described in S6 Table. Diagnostic criteria were previously
described in the respective references (S6 Table), but in summary, the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R)[122], and/or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
[123] criteria was used for diagnosis for the AGRE, AGP and SSC datasets, and clinician diag-
nosis for the UCSF-Weiss dataset. The ASD affected child and both parents were included in
each study. All samples were anonymized for analysis.

ASD dataset SNP quality control

Data preparation, quality control, and imputation were conducted as described previously in
Mitra, I. et al. [124]. First, SNPs were filtered using PLINK[63,64] (see web resources) for
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), call rate, minor allele frequency (MAF) and Mendel
errors separately in each ASD dataset (S6 Table). Next, imputation was performed separately
for each dataset using IMPUTE2[125] (see web resources), following the recommended pipe-
line. Lastly, each ASD dataset was combined together, and the following quality control steps
were performed: SNPs with severe departure (P < 1.0x10-6) from HWE in Caucasian founders
were removed; SNPs were removed if they had different MAF (P < 1.0x10-6) in Caucasians
between multiple datasets; SNPs were removed if they had MAF < 1% in Caucasians, or
MAF < 2% in the combined dataset. We excluded chromosome X. The final dataset for the
analysis included 4,471,807 autosomal SNPs.

Individual quality control for ASD datasets

Initial data preparation and quality control for ASD individuals was conducted for each data-
set, as described previously in Mitra, I. et al. [124]. For each dataset, the following individual
quality control filters were applied using PLINK[63,64]: genotyping rate, heterozygosity rate,
verifying individual sex, verifying known relationships, removing individuals contributing to
confounding relationship, and keeping one instance of individuals present in multiple studies.
After combining the multiple datasets, sex and family structure were re-checked.

To avoid population stratification, we selected only Caucasian individuals for the analysis.

Ancestry was determined using the first two principal components resulting from multidi-
mensional scaling with PLINK[63,64] (—mds-plot option) (S8 Fig). A proband and both
parents were required to fall within the Caucasian cluster for inclusion in the analysis. Only
unrelated complete trios were used. The final dataset included 4,109 ASD affected cases (3,517
males and 592 females) with both parents. A QQ plot for main effect association is shown in
S9 Fig. As our data were family-based, we used non-transmitted parental alleles, commonly
known as pseudo-controls, generated by the—tucc option in PLINK[63,64] instead of unre-
lated healthy individuals. These 4,109 pseudo-controls are perfectly matched to cases for
ancestry, thereby serving as a control for any population confounding.

Epistasis in ASD

Creating the Ras/MAPK SNP set
We included the following genes in the Ras/MAPK pathway as the set of interest: NF1, BRAF,
SOS1, RASA2, RASA1, SOS2, MAPK1, MAP2K1, SPRED1, CBL, SHOC2, PTPN11, RAF1, KRAS,
LZTR1, RIT1, and NRAS. Genes with no SNPs represented within the ASD dataset (HRAS,
MAP2K2, and MAPK3) could not be included. We extracted all SNPs within 5kb of each gene.
2,520 SNPs were included in the Ras/MAPK SNP set to be used for enrichment assessment in
association and for the epistasis analysis (S1 Table).

Ras/MAPK polymorphism enrichment in ASD association

Permutation testing procedures were implemented to establish significance of association sig-
nal enrichment in the Ras/MAPK SNP set. First, we performed a TDT (—tdt in PLINK
[63,64]) in the 4,109 ASD trios to test for association. Then, at a given Benjamini and Hoch-
berg’s FDR[126] (q = 0.2), we compared the percent of SNPs in the Ras/MAPK set (S1 Table)
meeting this criterion in the TDT results to the empirical null distribution produced by per-
muted data. The FDR threshold was chosen to maximize power by minimizing instances of 0
or 100% of SNPs meeting the criterion, but is an arbitrary threshold not intended to indicate
significance, only as a means of comparison with permuted data. At lower FDR thresholds, no
SNPs are available to test, and beginning at FDR 0.2 approximately 10% of SNPs pass the
threshold, which is sufficient for testing enrichment (S7 Table). To generate each of 100 per-
muted gene sets, a random gene was selected from 100 RefSeq (see web resources) genes with
the most similar size (using the longest transcript) to each Ras/MAPK gene (S1 Table) and
compiled into a SNP set using the same procedure (all SNPs within 5kb). These sets appear
well matched to the Ras/MAPK set, as they have similar numbers of SNPs (Ras/MAPK 2,520;
permutation median 2,528) and allele frequency (Ras/MAPK average 0.18; permutation aver-
age 0.19). The permuted gene lists were analyzed with the same protocol as the Ras/MAPK set
to produce the null distribution for comparison. The empirical P-value was calculated as the
proportion of results from the null distribution equal to or greater than the results from the
Ras/MAPK set[127].

Epistasis Ras/MAPK ‘set-by-all’ case-only test

For the epistasis analysis, the dataset was comprised of 4,109 ASD affected cases and 4,471,807
SNPs. We used the—fast-epistasis test with the case-only and set-by-all options implemented in
PLINK[63,64] to perform pairwise epistasis tests between each SNP in the defined Ras/MAPK
SNP set (N = 2,520 SNPs) and SNPs across the autosomal genome. This epistasis test is per-
formed by testing an allelic odds ratio, based on collapsing the 4N independent alleles observed
at two loci in a sample of N individuals into a 2x2 table, so the allele (not the individual or
haplotype) is the unit of analysis. The four cells are (a) 4AABB+2AABb+2AaBB+AaBb, (b)
4AAbb+2AABb+2Aabb+AaBb, (c) 4aaBB+2aaBb+2AaBB+AaBb, (d) 4aabb+2aaBb+
2Aabb+AaBb. The odds ratio is then estimated as ad/bc with variance 1/a+1/b+1/c+1/d. This
test follows a standard normal distribution under the multiplicative model of no interaction.
Appropriate type I error rates have been observed in simulation and power is equivalent to a
logistic regression test for epistasis. The correlation with a logistic regression analysis is high
(r = 0.995) [63],[64].

Two SNPs on the same chromosome were excluded from consideration in order to conser-

vatively eliminate linkage disequilibrium or effects of rare variants. We calculated a genome-
wide significance threshold (P = 7.6x10-10) accounting for multiple LD groups per Ras/MAPK
gene and the proportion of the genome tested for each genome-wide epistasis screen (calcula-
tions shown in S2 Table). We also utilized a gene-based significance threshold set by dividing

PLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006516 January 11, 2017

Epistasis in ASD

the GWAS significance threshold (P = 5.0x10-8) by the number of genes in the Ras/MAPK set
for an approximate independent hypothesis-testing estimate (P = 2.9x10-9), as genes were the
functional unit of the set-based testing. Because we use a case-only approach with similar
properties to identifying significant correlation, we have calculated power based on correlation
statistics. In this instance, for our stringent P-value threshold of 7.6 x 10−10, we have >80%
power to detect r2 = 0.11 with our sample size 4,109.

In order to rule out nonspecific effects and control for false-positives, we performed the

same epistasis analysis on the 4,109 matched pseudo-controls as a negative control. To test if
the most significant epistasis results between the ASD cases and ASD pseudo-controls were
significantly different, we performed a 2x2 chi-square test using the number of SNPs meeting
a given significance threshold in cases compared with pseudo-controls. We conducted a sec-
ond negative control analysis to rule out results due to interactions associated with viability by
using 4,109 parents that were of the same sex as the ASD cases. In addition, we performed epis-
tasis testing in our sample for a permuted SNP set included in a non-candidate pathway
selected set as a negative control and for Ras/MAPK set in a homogeneous set of cases
(N = 1,136) and matched unaffected siblings (N = 1,136) from unique families from the SSC
dataset as a positive control. For both, we measured odds ratios at varying P-value thresholds
down to P < 10−4 (S2 and S3 Figs).

Trio correlation test

To statistically validate the results from the case-only epistasis test, we used an independent
test, called the trio correlation test[128].The trio correlation test leverages information from
the parental genotypes to compute the expected distribution of the offspring genotypes then
used in a correlation test. This test was provided to us as an R script (see web resources). To
individually test candidate SNP pairs for interaction, we tested the nominally significant inter-
action results (P < 1.0x10-6) from the PLINK[63,64] epistasis test. To confirm the absence of
false-positive results, we performed a Spearman correlation test in R (see web resources)
between the P-values of the nominally significant PLINK[63,64] epistasis test results
(P < 1.0x10-6) and their corresponding P-value from the trio correlation test (S4 Fig).

RASopathy dataset

We have previously described in detail the recruitment and phenotype data collection in
RASopathy subjects[56]. In summary, patients with a physician (medical geneticist or neurolo-
gist) confirmed NF1, NS, CS, CFC diagnosis were included in the study. We recruited subjects
from the NF/RAS Pathway Genetics Clinic UCSF, UCSF NF Symposium, RASopathy support
groups (NF, Inc., Children’s Tumor Foundation, Noonan Syndrome Foundation, CFC Inter-
national, Costello Syndrome Family Support Network, and Costello Kids), and three national
RASopathy family meetings (Chicago, Illinois, USA, July 2011; Berkeley, California, USA, July
2009; Orlando, Florida, USA, August 2013). In addition, NF1 patients were recruited at Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) through online postings (NF, Inc., and Children’s
Tumor Foundation), and the Neurofibromatosis and Neurocutaneous Disorders clinic at the
Children’s Hospital, Los Angeles. We enrolled the unaffected siblings of RASopathy subjects
as controls.

To measure ASD symptoms, we used the SRS questionnaire[129]. The SRS questionnaire is

a quantitative and continuous measure of social ability. Parents or persons well-acquainted
with the study participant answered the 65-item SRS questionnaire regarding traits character-
istic of ASD. Following the SRS manual, we calculated the raw score for each individual, and
then calculated the sex-normalized T-scores. A total of 257 RASopathy patients and 142

Epistasis in ASD

RASopathy-unaffected full siblings of RASopathy patients with SRS phenotype data were
recruited. Further detailed information about the SRS questionnaire data for the sample popu-
lation can be found in Adviento et al. (2014)[56].

RASopathy dataset genotyping and quality control

All participants provided blood or saliva samples for DNA extraction. Blood samples were col-
lected by venipuncture using standard procedures. Saliva samples of families involved in the
study were collected by mail or in person at family meetings. Participants provided saliva sam-
ples using the Oragene Discover kit (OGR-250 for children and OGR-500 for adults) by DNA
Genotek (see web resources). DNA was extracted using the manufacturer’s standard protocol.
All specimens were anonymized for analysis.

All DNA samples were genotyped in the Genomics Core Facility (GCF) of UCSF on the
Affymetrix Axiom EUR array following standard manufacturer protocols. The Axiom EUR
array contains approximately 675,000 SNPs across the genome[130]. Genotype calling was
performed using Axiom GT1 algorithm as part of the Affymetrix Genotyping Console™ (GTC)
Software (see web resources). For analysis, we used samples that had a dish QC (probe inten-
sity) threshold greater than 82% and a genotype call rate greater than 97%. Additional quality
control procedures were performed in PLINK[63,64]. Identification of samples was validated
based on sex and familial relationships, using pairwise identity by decent (IBD) estimation
(—genome). Samples failing quality control checks, including incorrect sex (—check-sex),
excessive heterozygosity (—het), and other indicators of DNA contamination were removed.
One sample was selected for analysis from monozygotic twin pairs or duplicate samples. To
ensure that within each group all subjects were unrelated, a maximum of one person per family
was selected to be in each of the control sibling, CFC, CS, NF1, and NS groups. SNPs were
removed based on the following quality filters:  5% missing rate, and Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium P 10−4. The final dataset used for analysis included 658,746 SNPs with a 99.70% gen-
otyping rate. The final individuals included were 209 RASopathy subjects (49 CFC, 50 CS, 60
NF1, 50 NS) and 84 control siblings.

Data analysis in RASopathy dataset

We performed a multidimensional scaling analysis of genome-wide pairwise identity-by-state
(IBS) distances in PLINK[63,64] for all individuals in the dataset. We used the first five dimen-
sions as covariates in the analysis to correct for population stratification and batch effects. To
accurately compare between the RASopathy and control sibling groups, we scaled the T-scores
within each group (CFC, CS, NF1, NS, and sibling) so that the mean of the values was 0 and
variance was 1, and excluded outlier values greater or less than 3 standard deviations (SD)
from the mean (S5 Fig). For each group (CFC, CS, NF1, NS, sibling), we performed QTL map-
ping by implementing in PLINK[63,64] a linear regression analysis using the scaled SRS scores
as a quantitative trait (—linear). This resulted in the multi-linear regression model Y = b0 +
b1ADD + b2COV1 + b3COV2. . . bnCOV5 + e. To analyze the RASopathy groups
together (CFC, CS, NF1, and NS) with greater statistical power, we used METASOFT[131]
(see web resources) to conduct a random effects meta-analysis using Han and Eskin’s random
effects model[131]. We also report the Cochran’s Q statistic, calculated using METASOFT
[131], to analyze heterogeneity between RASopathy groups. The data underlying the top six
potential modifiers are graphically represented in S6 Fig, by boxplot (MAF>0.05) or distribu-
tion (MAF 0.05).

RNA extraction from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells

To induce neural differentiation, free floating induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) aggregates
were formed for 24 hours in mTeSR1 (Stemcell Technologies) and then switched to a Neural
medium [DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), N2 supplement (Invitrogen), MEM-NEAA (Gibco) and
2 μg/ml Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich)] with media exchange every other day[132]. To promote
neural induction, the small molecules SB431542 (5 μM, Stemgent) and LDN-193189 (0.25 μM,
Stemgent) were added for 48 hours. On day 3, aggregates were attached to 6 well plates and
cultured in neural media for an additional week during which rosettes appeared in the colo-
nies. On day 11, neuroepithelial cells in the center of the colonies were mechanically removed
and kept as free floating aggregates. At day 25 of neural differentiation, neurospheres were dis-
sociated into single cells using Accutase (Stem Cell Technologies) and cultured as monolayer
neural progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs were plated into poly-ornithine/laminin -coated plates
at 50,000 cells/cm2 and fed with forebrain neuronal medium [Neurobasal medium (Invitro-
gen), supplemented with N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and B27 supplement (Invitrogen)[132].
Cells were fed twice a week and RNA samples were extracted at 5 weeks after plating. Total
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instruction.

Reverse transcription reactions and quantitative real time PCR
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was produced from 1 μg of total RNA using High Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Life technologies). The qRT-PCR assay was performed using approxi-
mately 20 ng of cDNA and Taqman gene expression master mix in a QuantStudio™ 6 Flex
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Expression level was determined by relative
quantification in comparison to the endogenous control gene GUSB. Expression of each target
gene (ELMO1, GPR141, NME8, SFRP4, EPDR1, and STARD3NL) was assessed relative to a con-
trol sample (comparative Ct method). Samples were run in technical triplicates, and the
threshold suggested by the instrument software was used (after visual confirmation) to calcu-
late the Ct. Outlier replicate samples were excluded from analysis. The Taqman probes used in
this study are summarized in S8 Table.
