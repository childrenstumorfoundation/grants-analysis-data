Abstract

Purpose: GDC-0973 is a potent and selective mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) model-
ing was used to relate GDC-0973 plasma and tumor concentrations, tumor pharmacodynamics and
antitumor efﬁcacy to establish pharmacokinetic endpoints and predict active doses in the clinic.

Experimental Design: A PK–PD model was used to characterize GDC-0973 tumor disposition and in vivo
potency in WM-266-4 xenograft mice. Simulations were conducted using the PK–PD model along with
human pharmacokinetics to identify a target plasma concentration and predict active doses. In vivo potency
and antitumor efﬁcacy were characterized in A375 melanoma xenograft mice, and a population-based
integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy model was used to relate tumor pharmacodynamics (%pERK decrease) to
antitumor activity.

Results: GDC-0973 showed a sustained tumor pharmacodynamic response due to longer residence in
tumor than in plasma. Following single doses of GDC-0973, estimated in vivo IC50 values of %pERK
decrease based on tumor concentrations in xenograft mice were 0.78 (WM-266-4) and 0.52 mmol/L
(A375). Following multiple doses of GDC-0973, the estimated in vivo IC50 value in WM-266-4 increased
(3.89 mmol/L). Human simulations predicted a minimum target plasma concentration of 83 nmol/L
and an active dose range of 28 to 112 mg. The steep relationship between tumor pharmacodynamics
(%pERK decrease) and antitumor efﬁcacy suggests a pathway modulation threshold beyond which
antitumor efﬁcacy switches on.

Conclusions: Clinical observations of %pERK decrease and antitumor activity were consistent
with model predictions. This article illustrates how PK–PD modeling can improve the translation
of preclinical data to humans by providing a means to integrate preclinical and early clinical data.

observed in several tumor types, including 50% to 70% of
malignant melanomas, 30% of papillary thyroid cancer,
and 10% to 15% of colorectal and ovarian cancers, among
others (1, 5–7). The majority of these mutations are in exon
15, which results in a Val600 Glu (V600E) amino acid
substitution, leading to constitutive kinase activation (8).
Cancer cells harboring the V600E B-RAF mutation have
been shown to be particularly sensitive to inhibition of
mitogen–activated protein (MAP)/extracellular
signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK; ref. 9), making MEK
an attractive target for small molecule inhibitors.

More than 10 MEK inhibitors have been evaluated in the
clinic (4). Despite the activity around this target and signs of
clinical efﬁcacy (10, 11), none have yet been approved for
clinical use. However, the recently approved B-RAF inhib-
itor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), has been reported to be very
effective in patients with melanoma with mutated B-RAF
causing robust complete or partial tumor regression (12).

Translational Relevance

The current work applies pharmacokinetic–pharma-
codynamic (PK–PD) modeling to characterize tumor
disposition and pharmacodynamics of a mitogen-
activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor, GDC-0973, in
preclinical tumor models. PK–PD modeling was used
to translate preclinical tumor accumulation characteris-
tics and identify a minimum target plasma concentration
in patients. Predictions of active doses were based upon
80% suppression of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and
compared well with reported clinical responses. Using
an integrated PK–PD efﬁcacy model, the relationship
between pathway modulation and efﬁcacy was deﬁned.
Our analysis suggests a pathway suppression threshold
beyond which antitumor activity switches on. Our
observations are consistent with clinical data reported
for PD-0325901, another MEK inhibitor, and vemura-
fenib, a B-RAF inhibitor, both of which target the RAF/
MEK/ERK pathway. This work illustrates how PK–PD
modeling can be used to improve the predictive value of
preclinical data in the phase I setting.

The vemurafenib study highlights the importance of the
RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in cancers with B-RAF
mutations. Therefore, it can be expected that there will
be continued interest in MEK inhibitors as an alternative
means of targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Finally,
MEK inhibitors given in combination with B-RAF inhibi-
tors can provide a means to prevent the emergence of
acquired drug resistance in tumors (13, 14).

GDC-0973 (also known as XL518), (S)-[3,4-diﬂuoro-2-
(2-ﬂuoro-4-iodophenylamino)phenyl][3-hydroxy-3-(pipe-
ridin-2-yl)azetidin-1-yl]methanone (Supplementary Fig.
S1), is a novel potent, selective MEK1 inhibitor with an
IC50 estimate of 4.2 nmol/L in an in vitro biochemical assay
against puriﬁed MEK1 enzyme (15). GDC-0973 showed
more than 100-fold selectively for MEK1 over MEK2 and
showed no signiﬁcant inhibition when tested against a
panel of more than 100 of serine-threonine and tyrosine
kinases. Preliminary studies conducted in xenograft mice
suggested that the duration of tumor phosphorylated ERK1/
2 (pERK) inhibition, the predominant downstream mea-
sure of MEK inhibition, outlasted the presence of GDC-
0973 in plasma, and was consistent with the residence time
of GDC-0973 in tumors (data not shown). This observed
disconnect between GDC-0973 plasma concentrations and
tumor pharmacodynamic (PD) response suggested that
additional investigation into the pharmacokinetic–phar-
macodynamic (PK–PD) relationship of GDC-0973 in
tumor was warranted.

Preclinical PK–PD modeling can play an important role
in the drug discovery and development process by provid-
ing an integrated understanding of relationships between
compound plasma concentrations, PD marker response,

and efﬁcacy. In addition, PK–PD modeling is a useful tool
that can facilitate the translation of preclinical data to
humans. The objectives of the current studies were (i) to
characterize the tumor disposition and in vivo potency of
GDC-0973 in xenograft mice, (ii) to estimate the minimum
target GDC-0973 plasma concentrations in humans, and
(iii) to characterize the relationship between RAF/MEK/ERK
signaling pathway inhibition and antitumor efﬁcacy. Our
studies with GDC-0973 illustrate how the incorporation
of early phase I clinical data into existing preclinical
PK–PD models can serve not only to improve our under-
standing of the behavior of GDC-0973 in humans but also
to help prospectively predict responses in the clinic.

Materials and Methods

GDC-0973 (also known as XL518; Supplementary Fig.
S1) was provided by Exelixis. All studies were conducted
using the dihydrochloride salt of GDC-0973. Solvents used
for analysis were of analytic or high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) grade (Fisher Scientiﬁc). WM-
266-4 and A375 human melanoma cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection. All other reagents
or material used in this study were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich unless otherwise stated. In vivo studies were con-
ducted at Exelixis and the Exelixis Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee approved all procedures in animals.

In vivo PK–PD study in WM-266-4 xenografts

Brieﬂy, 5 million WM-266-4 melanoma cells were resus-
pended in Hank balanced salt solution and implanted
intradermally into the hind ﬂank of female NCR nude mice
(Taconic). On days 11 or 13 after the implantation, xeno-
graft mice with tumor volumes of approximately 100 to 120
mm3 were randomly assigned to 8 groups (n ¼ 27 per
group), 4 single dose groups and 4 multiple dose groups.
One day after randomization and group assignment, mice
in the single dose groups were given a single oral dose of
vehicle (water for injection USP), 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of GDC-
0973 (expressed as free base equivalents). Mice in the
multiple dose groups were given daily oral doses of vehicle
(water for injection USP), 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of GDC-0973
for 14 days. Plasma and tumor samples (n ¼ 3 per time
point) were collected from euthanized mice predose and at
2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours postdose on day 1
(single dose groups) or day 14 (multiple dose groups).
Samples were stored at  80
C until analysis. GDC-0973
concentrations in plasma and tumor lysates were deter-
mined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC/MS-MS). The dynamic range of the assay was
0.004 to 35 mmol/L. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was deter-
mined by Western blot analysis.

base equivalents). Plasma and tumor GDC-0973 concen-
trations and tumor pERK inhibition were assessed at 24 (all
doses), 48 (10 and 30 mg/kg only), and 72 (10 and 30 mg/
kg only) hours postdose (n ¼ 5 animals per assessment).
Quantitation of GDC-0973 concentrations in plasma and
tumor and tumor %pERK decrease was conducted as
described for the WM-266-4 studies.

Equation (D) was ﬁt to GDC-0973 tumor concentrations
and tumor %pERK decrease data from A375 xenografts
using GraphPad Prism V4.02 (GraphPad Software Inc.).
The Hill coefﬁcient (h) was ﬁxed to 1 for this analysis. The
use of this model [Equation (D)] is explained in more detail
in the PK–PD modeling section later.

In vivo efﬁcacy study with A375 xenografts

The GDC-0973 in vivo efﬁcacy study was conducted
with A375 xenograft–bearing mice. Tumor volumes were
measured in 2 dimensions (length and width) using
Ultra Cal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111, Fred V. Fowler
Company, Inc.). The following formula was used with
Excel v11.2 (Microsoft Corporation) to calculate tumor
volume (TV): TV (mm3) ¼ (length  width2)  0.5.
Tumors were monitored until they reached a mean vol-
ume of approximately 100 to 120 mm3 at which time the
mice were assigned to each dosing group (n ¼ 10 animals
per group) such that mean tumor volume was similar
for each group. Mice in each group received oral doses of
either vehicle (water for injection USP) once daily,
0.3 mg/kg once daily, 1 mg/kg once daily, 3 mg/kg once
daily, 10 mg/kg once daily, 30 mg/kg every second day,
or 30 mg/kg every third day of GDC-0973 free base
equivalents for 14 days. Tumor sizes and body weights

were recorded twice weekly, and the mice were regularly
observed over the course of the study. Mice were eutha-
nized if their tumor volume exceeded 2,000 mm3 or if
their body weight dropped by more than 20% of the
starting weight.

PK–PD modeling

WM-266-4 xenograft PK–PD model. PK–PD modeling
for the WM-266-4 xenograft studies was conducted using
SAAM II (Saam Institute, University of Washington, Seat-
tle, WA). Brieﬂy, Equations (A) to (C) and Fig. 1A describe
the PK model that was simultaneously ﬁt to mean plasma
and tumor GDC-0973 concentrations from single and
multiple dose WM-266-4 xenograft mice studies. Equa-

Where %pERKdecrease (%) is the percentage decrease of

tumor concentration at which the %pERKdecrease is half of
Imax. Parameter estimates from the PK model described
by Equations (A) to (C) were ﬁxed before estimating
the PD parameters shown in Equation (D). The PK–PD
model [Equations (A)–(D) and Fig. 1B] was ﬁt to %pERK
decrease data from single and multiple dose studies sepa-
rately as there were apparent changes in the tumor %pERK
response to GDC-0973 following multiple days of dosing.
PK and PD parameters estimates are presented as the
estimate followed by the %SE in parentheses. Finally, the
rationale for using the PK–PD model described by Equa-
tions (A) to (D) and Fig. 1B stemmed from observations
from preliminary studies that the duration of tumor %pERK
decrease was substantially longer than the presence of
GDC-0973 in plasma and was consistent with the longer
residence time of GDC-0973 in tumors.

Human simulations. Patients in the phase I clinical trial
were given daily oral doses of GDC-0973 continuously for
21 days over a 28-day cycle (16). Mean GDC-0973 concen-
tration–time data were obtained from 3 patients from
cohort 1 who were given 0.05 mg/kg daily oral doses of
GDC-0973 (16). In these 3 patients, plasma samples for PK
evaluation were collected on days 1 and 21 at predose, 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (day 21 only), and 192 (day 21 only) hours
postdose. The WM-266-4 PK model accounting for tumor
disposition described by Equations (A) to (C) and Fig. 1A
was ﬁt to mean human GDC-0973 concentration–time data
to estimate Cl, ka, and V/F (apparent volume of distribution
in L/kg). Tumor disposition was assumed to be similar
between humans and WM-266-4 xenografts, thus Cltp and
Clpt were ﬁxed during the PK model ﬁtting process. Human
PK parameters are presented as the estimate followed by the
%SE in parentheses. Human PK parameter estimates along
with PD parameters (Imax, IC50, and h) from the single and
multiple dose WM-266-4 xenografts studies were used in
the PK–PD model (Fig. 1B) to conduct human simulations
to provide a range of response.

Integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy modeling. To relate pathway
modulation (expressed as tumor %pERK decrease) to anti-
tumor effect, an integrated population-based PK-PD-efﬁca-
cy model (Fig. 1C) was used to ﬁt individual longitudinal
tumor data from A375 melanoma xenograft efﬁcacy studies.

Brieﬂy, %pERK decrease in tumor was simulated for all

study during ﬁtting process using the WM-266-4 xeno-
graft PK–PD model and estimated PD parameters from
the in vivo target modulation studies with A375 xenografts
(see Fig. 4A). The S-ADAPT program, an augmented
version of ADAPT II with population analysis capabilities
(17, 18), was used to ﬁt individual tumor volumes from
all dose levels of the A375 xenograft efﬁcacy study simul-
taneously. Intersubject variability was assumed to be log-
normally distributed and ﬁtted using an exponential
variance model. Residual variability error was modeled
using a proportional-additive error model. In cases where
intersubject variance was small and could not be estimat-
ed reliably, the intersubject variance was ﬁxed to 0.00001.
Population PD parameter estimates are presented as the
estimate followed by the %SE in parentheses.

Results
Studies in WM-266-4 xenografts

PK–PD model adequately characterizes GDC-0973 tumor
accumulation and tumor PD response in WM-266-4 xenograft
mice. The objective of this study was to characterize the
concentration of GDC-0973 in plasma and tumor tissue,
the PD response in tumor tissue, and the associated
PK–PD relationships over time. WM-266-4 melanoma
cells are PTEN-deﬁcient and harbor a V600D B-RAF muta-
tion conferring activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway
that is functionally similar to the V600E B-RAF mutation
(5). WM-266-4 xenografts were chosen for this study
because they are moderately responsive to MEK inhibition
allowing for enough tumor tissue to remain after 14 days
of dosing to evaluate both GDC-0973 concentrations and
PD response in tumor. Little or no tumor tissue remains
following 14 days of dosing in xenograft mice bearing
more sensitive melanoma tumors such as A375. The
plasma and tumor concentration–time proﬁles and tumor
%pERK decrease for the WM-266-4 xenografts given a
single or multiple daily oral doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg
of GDC-0973 are presented in Fig. 2A and B, respectively.
Following single oral doses, GDC-0973 concentrations
and PD response is dose-dependent (Fig. 2A; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2). GDC-0973 concentrations in tumor tissue
are both higher and more sustained than in plasma. PD
response mirrored tumor concentrations with %pERK
decrease in tumor observed well beyond the time frame
that GDC-0973 was observed in plasma. Overall, a similar
situation was observed following 14 days of daily GDC-
0973 dosing. However, despite higher GDC-0973 concen-
trations in plasma and tumor due to drug accumulation
than in the single dose study, the magnitude of tumor
%pERK decrease was less at later time points (Fig. 2B).

The higher and sustained tumor concentrations observed
in WM-266-4 xenografts was reﬂected in the estimate of
intercompartmental clearance from the plasma to tumor
compartment (Clpt) being approximately 40-fold higher
than the intercompartmental clearance from the tumor to
plasma compartment (Cltp). PD parameters describing
pERK reduction were also estimated separately for single
and multiple dose experiments using the PK–PD model
(Fig. 1B). Plots showing observed and model-predicted
%pERK decrease in tumor are presented in Fig. 2E and F
for single and multiple dose studies, respectively. No
evidence of hysteresis indicative of time delays in onset
of PD response was observed in these plots. Associated

between plasma concentrations and tumor PD modu-
lation to identify a minimum target plasma concentration
required in patients. Early reports of the phase I trial for
the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 suggested a trend toward
progression-free survival at %pERK decreases of more than
60% (19). In addition, signs of activity were observed in
the phase I clinical trial for CI-1040, a ﬁrst-generation
MEK1/2 inhibitor, at doses associated with a median tumor
%pERK decrease of 73% (20). On the basis of these data, we
set 80% pERK decrease at steady state as our target for
tumor PD modulation.

The PK model used to characterize tumor disposition in
WM-266-4 xenograft mice (Fig. 1A) was ﬁt to mean GDC-
0973 plasma concentration–time data from the ﬁrst cohort
of patients on the GDC-0973 phase I clinical trial (16). An
assumption was made that tumor disposition is similar in
humans and xenograft-bearing mice; therefore, Cltp and
Clpt were ﬁxed to estimates from WM-266-4 xenograft
mice during the ﬁtting process. The estimated human PK
parameters are presented in Supplementary Table S1, and
the plot of observed versus predicted GDC-0973 plasma
concentrations following the model ﬁtting is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S3. Simulations were conducted using
the human PK and PD parameters from the WM-266-4
single dose study. The PD parameters from the single dose
WM-266-4 study were chosen for this simulation because
we wanted to identify the minimum target plasma concen-
tration, and the in vivo IC50 following multiple doses of
GDC-0973 was approximately 5-fold higher (see Table 1).
In addition, the in vivo IC50 estimate from the single dose
WM-266-4 study was comparable with the in vivo IC50
estimate from V600E B-RAF mutant A375 melanoma xeno-
graft mice (see below). On the basis of the human simu-
lation shown in Fig. 3A, the minimum GDC-0973 plasma

concentration at trough (24 hours postdose) required
for 80% tumor pERK decrease at steady state is 83
nmol/L. No adjustments were made to account for potential
differences in free drug concentrations because there is
no evidence of GDC-0973 protein–binding differences in
mouse and human plasma (both 95% bound, data not
shown).
To assess the cohort at which the target of 80% tumor
pERK decrease could be achieved, we conducted prospective
human simulations of the phase I clinical trial. Figure 3B
and C shows prospective human trial simulations mimick-
ing the planned doses in the phase I clinical trial. Because we
would not know the B-RAF mutation status in patients
during the dose-escalation portion of the phase I clinical
trial, we conducted these prospective human simulations
using PD parameters from both the single and multiple dose
GDC-0973 studies in WM-266-4 xenograft mice to provide
a range of doses where we might see antitumor activity.
On the basis of our simulations, the goal of reducing
pERK by 80% could be achieved at a daily oral dose of
28 (0.4 mg/kg; shown in Fig. 3B) to 112 mg (1.6 mg/kg;
shown in Fig. 3C) of GDC-0973 in cohorts 4 to 6 of the
clinical trial.

During the course of the phase I clinical trial, tumor
biopsies were collected for biomarker assessments. To test
the performance of our PK–PD model, we conducted a
retrospective simulation to compare the modeled decrease
in tumor pERK with the observed immunohistochemistry-
assessed decrease in one patient from the 0.2-mg/kg dose
cohort for whom we had evaluable pre- and postdosing
matched tumor biopsies. Two tumor biopsies were collect-
ed from this patient at 4 hours postdose on day 20 of dosing.

Studies in A375 xenografts

Relationship between tumor %pERK decrease and GDC-
0973 tumor concentrations in A375 xenograft mice. To
understand the relationship between GDC-0973 concen-
tration and PD response in an additional B-RAF mutant
xenograft tumor, Equation (D) was ﬁt to GDC-0973 tumor
concentration and tumor pERK data from A375 xenograft–
bearing mice. A375 melanoma cells harbor the B-RAF

V600E mutation conferring activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK
pathway (5, 21). This V600E mutant melanoma cell line
is relevant for understanding the effect of MEK inhibition
on human patients with melanoma with this common
B-RAF mutation. The in vivo IC50 estimated in A375 xeno-
graft mice (0.52 mmol/L; see Fig. 4A) was comparable with
the in vivo IC50 estimated from the single dose WM-266-4
xenograft study (i.e., 0.78 mmol/L; see Table 1 and Fig. 2E).

administration over a broad dose range (0.3–30 mg/kg) and
using varying schedules (once daily, every 2 days, and every
3 days; see Fig. 4B). All 3 schedules provided signiﬁcant
antitumor activity in this model, consistent with published
reports for GDC-0973 (15).

Integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy analysis in A375 xenografts.

An integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy analysis was conducted on the
A375 xenograft efﬁcacy study to understand the relation-
ship between modulation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
pathway and antitumor efﬁcacy in a B-RAF V600E melano-
ma tumor model. All 70 xenograft mice (10 per dose group)
were included in the analysis. The process is described in Fig.
4C and uses the integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy model shown
in Fig. 1C. In brief, a PK–PD model (Fig. 1B) built using the
PK parameters from WM-266-4 xenografts (Table 1) and PD
parameters from A375 xenografts (Fig. 4A) was used to
simulate tumor %pERK decreases for all dosing regimens
in the A375 xenograft efﬁcacy study. Individual longitudinal
tumor volume data from all A375 xenograft–bearing mice
were ﬁt simultaneously to an integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy
model (Fig. 1C) which involved the addition of an indirect
response model [Equation (E)], where tumor growth inhi-
bition is driven by tumor %pERK decrease, to the PK–PD
model described. Figure 4D is a plot of the individual
observed versus individual predicted tumor volumes of the
resulting population model ﬁt, suggesting that the model
adequately captured the growth characteristics of the tumor
data from the efﬁcacy study. Estimated PD parameters
from this integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy analysis are presented
in Table 2. PD parameters along with the inter- and intrain-
dividual variability were estimated with acceptable preci-
sion with %SE of all estimates being 38%. The maximum
antitumor effect (Kmax) was approximately 2-fold larger
than the estimated net growth rate constant (kng) consistent

PK–PD Analysis of a MEK Inhibitor

with regression of A375 xenograft tumors in response to
GDC-0973 treatment.

Using the estimated PD parameters, a plot of the rela-
tionship between RAF/MEK/ERK pathway knockdown (i.e.,
%pERK decrease) and efﬁcacy (i.e., K is the rate constant
describing the antitumor effect of GDC-0973) was gener-
ated and is shown in Fig. 4E. The steep relationship between
pathway inhibition and efﬁcacy is characterized by a Hill
slope (n) of approximately 11 (Fig. 4E, Table 2) and suggests
that there is a pathway suppression threshold beyond which
antitumor activity "switches on." In addition, the plot
shown in Fig. 4E suggests that for maximal antitumor
activity, more than 60% to 70% %pERK decrease is required
in A375 xenografts.

Discussion

GDC-0973 is a potent and selective MEK1 inhibitor that is
currently in phase I clinical trials as a potential antitumor
agent. The current study shows that GDC-0973 causes
potent inhibition of pERK in 2 preclinical models of B-RAF
mutant melanoma, WM-266-4 and A375 xenograft mice.
A375 xenografts bear melanoma tumors that harbor a
V600E B-RAF mutation that is sensitive to MEK inhibition
and represents a common mutation in human patients with
melanoma (5, 21). In contrast, WM-266-4 (V600D B-RAF
mutation and PTEN-deﬁcient) xenografts are only moder-
ately responsive to MEK inhibition but allow for sufﬁcient
tumor tissue after multiple days of GDC-0973 dosing
required to characterize GDC-0973 tumor disposition. Our
studies with WM-266-4 xenografts show that GDC-0973 is
not only present at higher concentrations in tumor relative
to plasma but also resides in the tumor for a longer dura-
tion. In vivo IC50 values based on GDC-0973 concentrations
in tumor tissue (A375 and WM-266-4 xenografts) ranged
from 0.52 to 3.89 mmol/L, and the PD response was shown
to be directly correlated with tumor concentrations in both
xenograft models examined. These data are consistent with
our observations from preliminary studies in other xeno-
graft mice (data not shown).

Mechanistic PK–PD modeling serves as an important tool
to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical data (22–
24). Our studies used WM-266-4 xenograft–bearing mice as
an experimental system to characterize the GDC-0973 con-
centration in tumor tissue over time. The incorporation of
human PK into the PK–PD model built using WM-266-4
xenograft mice studies allows for normalization of known
species differences in PK (25). We chose a sustained pERK
reduction target of 80% at steady state as the PD endpoint
for these simulations based on early published reports on
MEK inhibitors in the clinic (19, 20). Our simulations using
this "human PK–PD model" identiﬁed a minimum plasma
concentration of 83 nmol/L where we anticipated that
80% pERK decrease would be maintained at steady state
in tumor tissues. Prospective simulations of a human dose
escalation mimicking the phase I trial design predicted that
doses of 28 to 112 mg once daily would be sufﬁcient to meet
this target. Antitumor activity in patients with melanoma

with B-RAF mutations has now been reported at daily doses
of 60 and 100 mg in the clinic (16), consistent with pre-
dictions based on the described PK–PD model.

One interesting observation was that the tumor GDC-
0973 concentration required to reduce pERK in WM-266-4
tumor tissue increased during the 2-week dosing period.
The reasons for this shift in sensitivity over time are not
known but could be explained by subpopulations of less
sensitive tumor cells escaping MEK inhibition or the emer-
gence of resistant cells in response to continuous MEK
inhibition. Both mechanisms of resistance have been
reported for B-RAF and MEK inhibitors (26–28)

As a ﬁnal part of our analysis, we wanted to quantify
the relationship between RAF/MEK/ERK pathway modula-
tion (%pERK decrease) and tumor growth inhibition
through the use of an integrated PK–PD-efﬁcacy model
(Fig. 1C). A "pathway modulation–response curve" show-
ing the relationship between %pERK decrease and K (a
measure of antitumor effect of GDC-0973) was sigmoidal
and described by a Hill coefﬁcient of approximately 11
(Fig. 4E). This steep relationship between pathway modu-
lation and antitumor effect is suggestive of a threshold of
pERK inhibition beyond which antitumor activity "turns
on." The observed "switch-like" behavior is consistent with
reports of ultrasensitive stimulus–response curves observed
for MAPK cascades (29). "Switch-like" behavior has also
been recently reported in similar analyses conducted with
other kinase inhibitors such as GDC-0879, a B-RAF kinase
inhibitor (30), and GDC-0834, a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (31), and the hedgehog signaling pathway inhib-
itor, vismodegib (32).

Robust clinical activity has been reported for vemurafenib
(PLX4032) in patients with B-RAF mutant melanoma
(12, 33). Interestingly, no clinical responses were reported
in patients with melanoma with cytoplasmic reductions of
pERK in tumor of less than approximately 60%, whereas
pERK reductions were typically more than 80% in patients
who responded to vemurafenib (33). Similarly, phase I data
for PD-0325901, an MEK inhibitor, showed signs of clinical
activity in patients with B-RAF V600E melanoma at pERK
decreases of 76% or greater (10). On the basis of human
simulations presented in the manuscript,
the %pERK
decrease in tumor tissue is anticipated to be more than
80% at clinical doses of 28 to 112 mg/d GDC-0973, con-
sistent with the observed clinical activity in patients with B-
RAF mutant melanoma at daily doses of 60 and 100 mg (16).
Taken together, available clinical data suggest that a high
degree of suppression of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, above
a certain threshold, is required for robust antitumor activity.
Preclinical PK–PD modeling of anticancer therapeutics is
associated with certain assumptions and caveats. Xenograft

mouse models are the most common preclinical in vivo
efﬁcacy models used to evaluate and select new anticancer
therapies for clinical development (34, 35). An important
assumption when translating xenograft data to humans is
that drug concentrations required for PD modulation and
antitumor activity are the same in xenograft-bearing mice
and human patients with cancer. This assumes that drug
distribution is similar, despite reported differences in tumor
vasculature and transport
in xenograft versus human
tumors (36). Also, differences in growth rate of human and
xenograft tumors complicate the interpretation of xenograft
data. Finally, the selection of relevant tumor types that are
reﬂective of the disease that is being targeted is challenging.
Despite these challenges, the present GDC-0973 study
illustrates how PK–PD modeling can be used to improve
clinical translation of preclinical data to humans through
integration of all available information. Through our PK–
PD analysis using combined preclinical and limited early
clinical data, we characterized the relationship between
GDC-0973 plasma and tumor concentrations, tumor PD
response and antitumor activity. Using this knowledge, we
were able to successfully prospectively predict active doses
of GDC-0973 in patients with V600E melanoma and rough-
ly identify the number of dose escalations in the phase I
clinical trial required to reach active doses.
