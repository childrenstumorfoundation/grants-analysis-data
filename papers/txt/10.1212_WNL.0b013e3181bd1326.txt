Characteristics of children enrolled
in treatment trials for NF1-related
plexiform neurofibromas

ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe the characteristics of children enrolled in treatment trials for neurofibro-
matosis type 1 (NF1)–related plexiform neurofibroma (PN), PN tumor burden, PN-related compli-
cations, and treatment outcomes and to highlight the differences between characteristics of
children with NF1 vs children with cancers entered on early phase drug trials.
Methods: Pre-enrollment characteristics and complications of PN were retrospectively analyzed
in a cohort of 59 children with NF1-related PN treated on 1 of 7 clinical trials at the NIH between
1996 and 2007. Outcome was analyzed in a subset of 19 patients enrolled in phase I trials.
Comparisons to children with cancer were made from a similar analysis performed recently.
Results: The median age at enrollment was 8 years. The median PN volume was 555 mL. Most
patients had no prior chemotherapy or radiation, but nearly half had previous surgery for PN.
PN-associated complications and NF1 manifestations were common, including pain (53%),
other tumors (18%), and hypertension (8%). Investigational drug therapy was well tolerated.
A median of 10 treatment cycles was administered. Patients with NF1-related PN were
younger, had better performance score, had less prior therapy, and remained on study longer
than cancer patients.
Conclusions: Children with NF1-related plexiform neurofibroma (PN) enrolled in clinical trials had
large tumors with substantial morbidity. Clinical trials in these children provide information about drug
tolerance, cumulative toxicity, and pharmacokinetics in a younger population than early phase pediat-
ric cancer trials. This report may aid in the evaluation of the applicability of traditional pediatric cancer
trial designs and endpoints for NF1-related PN. Neurology® 2009;73:1273–1279

Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are a common and debilitating complication of neurofibroma-
tosis type 1 (NF1). These benign nerve sheath tumors cause significant morbidity through
disfigurement and compression of vital structures.1,2 PN are thought to be congenital, have
complex shapes, and appear to grow faster in children ⬍8 years old.3 Surgery is currently the
only standard treatment option for PN, but complete resection is often difficult due to their
large size, location, local invasiveness, or involvement of critical peripheral nerves.1,4

Research focused on the biology of NF1 and pathogenesis of PN4-7 has identified numerous
potential targets, many of which are shared with cancers for which new drugs are being devel-
oped, such as RAS, angiogenesis, growth factors, and the mammalian target of rapamycin.
Clinical trials of these new drugs are under way in children with refractory cancers and NF1-
related PN. Most NF1 trials use designs and endpoints that are similar to oncology trials, but
some aspects of NF1 and PN differ from refractory cancers and require new approaches toward
drug development. For example, standard methods used to measure tumor size and assess
response in cancer trials (RECIST8 and WHO9 criteria) were inadequate to quantify clinically

meaningful changes in PN5 and recently volu-
metric methods10-12 were developed for re-
sponse evaluation.3,7

The objectives of this report were to
characterize the population of pediatric pa-
tients who enroll
in treatment trials for
NF1-related PN, to examine PN disease
burden and associated complications, and
to evaluate the primary outcomes for pa-
tients who have participated in phase I
trials. We also compared baseline character-
istics and outcomes of children with NF1 to
children with refractory cancers enrolled in
phase I trials from a similar analysis we re-
cently performed.13 Understanding these
disease and outcome characteristics in chil-
dren with NF1-related PN treated on inves-
tigational drug trials may aid in subject
selection, trial design, and informed con-
sent discussions for physicians and patients
with NF1 considering enrollment in a clin-
ical trial.

METHODS Potential study participants were patients en-
rolled, treated, and followed in 1 of 7 investigational drug trials
for NF1-related PN (table 1)5,7,14-16 at the NIH Clinical Center
between August 1996 and July 2007. The patients at the NIH
are drawn from a national referral base. During this time period,
88 patients were screened at the NIH for a treatment trial, and
the 59 patients who were found eligible and enrolled in a trial
were all included in this retrospective cohort analysis. For 19
patients who subsequently participated in a second or third treat-
ment trial, only their participation in the first trial at the NIH
was included. Protocol registries, hospital charts, and research
charts were the source of data.

For comparison purposes, the data collection for this study
was modeled on the analysis of baseline and outcome character-
istics of children with refractory cancers who enrolled in early
phase drug trials at the NIH (n ⫽ 262).13

The clinical trials (table 1) had similar eligibility criteria,
which required a diagnosis of NF1 based on NIH consensus
criteria,17 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per-
formance status (or equivalent Lansky/Karnofsky score) of 0 –2,
serum hepatic transaminases ⱕ2 times the upper limit of nor-
mal, bilirubin ⱕ1.5 times the upper limit of normal, absolute
neutrophil count ⱖ1,500/␮L, and platelet count ⱖ100,000/
␮L. Three phase I trials (phenylbutyrate, phenylacetate, and tipi-
farnib) enrolled patients with refractory cancers and NF1-related
PN simultaneously and defined a maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) for the combined patient groups. All trials required that
PN were inoperable, and 4 trials required that patients had pro-
gressive disease (phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, tipifarnib phase
II, pirfenidone phase II), although progression was objectively
defined only in the phase II trials. Three trials (pirfenidone phase
I and II, tipifarnib phase II) required PN with the potential to
such as head and neck PN
cause significant morbidity,

that could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or
lumbar plexus PN that could cause nerve compression and loss
of function, PN that could result in major deformity (e.g., or-
bital lesions) or significant cosmetic problems, PN of the extrem-
ity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful
PN. Patients were treated and followed per the individual treat-
ment protocol.

Pre-enrollment characteristics. Pre-enrollment characteris-
tics collected included age at enrollment, age at diagnosis of
NF1, sex, family history, race, performance status, height,
weight, blood pressure, complete blood count, hepatic enzymes
and bilirubin, tumor volume, tumor location, prior surgery,
other malignancies, prior treatment regimens and radiation (for
PN or other tumors such as optic glioma), presence of pain, daily
narcotic use, and concomitant medications, which included reg-
ularly scheduled medications that patients were taking prior to
starting the treatment trial and excluded medications that were
administered on an as-needed basis, vitamin supplements, and
topical medications. Associated conditions with NF1 were also
tabulated, such as skeletal complications (scoliosis, pseudoar-
throsis, limb length discrepancy, pectus excavatum) and cogni-
tive deficits (caregiver reported). In addition, the PN location,
size, and associated actual or potential complications were cate-
gorized as follows: major physical deformity— cosmetically sig-
nificant facial, trunk, extremity masses, or spine (scoliosis related
to PN); limb hypertrophy; airway compression—present (clini-
cal compromise such as tracheostomy, airway stent, or continu-
ous positive airway pressure) or potential (PN in close proximity
to upper and lower airway); spinal cord compression—present
(deformity of spinal cord by neurofibroma, disruption of CSF
surrounding spinal cord) or potential (spinal neurofibroma pro-
truding into the spinal canal, but not deforming spinal cord);
blood vessel compression—present (clinical vascular compro-
mise) or potential (PN encasing large blood vessels of the heart
such as aorta, or others such as femoral artery); major bodily
dysfunction—present (motor weakness, decreased vision, or uri-
nary or bowel incontinence as a result of PN) or potential (PN
involving spinal or peripheral nerves, or surrounding bladder
and rectum).

Outcome characteristics. Outcome characteristics were col-
lected in 19 patients enrolled in phase I trials. Patients on phase
II trials (pirfenidone and tipifarnib) were excluded from this
analysis because the trials were ongoing or included a masked
placebo control arm. Outcome data collected included total cy-
cle number received, participation in pharmacokinetic (PK)
studies, grade ⬎2 toxicities experienced by the patient and
judged to be at least possibly related to the investigational agent,
dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) as defined by each protocol, hos-
pitalizations, blood product transfusions, off study reason, and
time to progression. Subjects were considered evaluable for tox-
icity if they completed at least one treatment cycle or if they
experienced a DLT during the first treatment cycle. Progression
was defined as ⱖ20% increase in PN volume for the pegintron
and pirfenidone phase I and a 25% increase in bidimensional
measurements by WHO criteria for the tipifarnib, phenylbu-
tyrate, and phenylacetate phase I trials.

Summary statistics were generated for pre-enrollment and
outcome characteristics. Time to progression was calculated
using Kaplan-Meier analysis from time of enrollment to pro-
gressive disease. All patients were enrolled in an investiga-
tional drug trial. Missing data values for patients per category
were listed as unavailable. For the 19 patients for whom out-
come data were evaluated, none were lost to follow-up. Statis-

Plexiform neurofibroma (PN)
anatomic location

A total of 87 PN were evaluated in 59 patients. A total of 23
patients had ⱖ2 PN. PN location: head (n ⫽ 6), head/neck
(n ⫽ 8), neck/trunk (n ⫽ 5), trunk (n ⫽ 35), trunk/extremities
(n ⫽ 21), extremity only (n ⫽ 3).

tical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0
(College Station, TX).

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All protocols were approved by the NCI Institutional
Review Board, and all patients or their legal guardians signed a
document of informed consent indicating their understanding of
the investigational nature and the risks of the study.

RESULTS Of the 59 patients included in this analy-
sis, 19 patients were enrolled in phase I trials and 40
patients were enrolled in phase II trials. Most clinical
trials evaluated noncytotoxic agents, but myelosup-
pression was a DLT on the tipifarnib phase I trial.5
Sixteen patients (27%) participated sequentially in 2
separate trials, and 3 patients (5%) participated in 3
trials.

Baseline characteristics prior to enrollment are de-
scribed in table 2. Most patients were young and had
not received substantial prior chemotherapy or radia-
tion treatment. They had a number of manifestations
of NF1, including hypertension and history of other
tumors. Other common nontumor manifestations
included cognitive deficits (51%), such as learning
disabilities or developmental delay, skeletal compli-
cations, such as scoliosis (39%), and pain (53%).

The majority of PN were located in the head,
neck, and trunk (figure) and were large with a me-
dian PN volume of 555 mL (range 20 –5,630 mL).
Approximately half of the patients had debulking
surgery for their PN and 40% of these patients un-
derwent ⱖ2 operations on the same PN prior to en-

rollment. The PN in this population resulted in
substantial complications including compression of
the airway and spinal cord (table 3). More than 90%
of patients had PN with the potential to cause ⱖ1 of
the complications shown in table 3.

Table 4 describes the outcome characteristics for
19 patients enrolled in phase I trials. All patients hap-
pened to be enrolled on dose levels at or above the
MTD. Participation in optional PK studies was
100% for studies in which PKs were an objective.
DLT during the first cycle was observed in 5 (26%)
patients (diarrhea n ⫽ 2, rash n ⫽ 1, somnolence
n ⫽ 1). Three of those patients were enrolled on dose
levels above the MTD. Patients received treatment
for long durations, although a significant portion of
patients had their doses transiently held (n ⫽ 12)
mostly due to toxicity, but all patients resumed treat-
ment after recovery. Eight patients underwent dose
reductions, the majority of which occurred during
the first cycle (75%). Patient hospitalizations on
study (32%) were for elective surgeries (n ⫽ 4) or
nonneutropenic infections (n ⫽ 2). No patients re-
quired blood product transfusions. The median time
to progression on study was 14 months.

Several clinically relevant differences between the
characteristics and outcomes of children with NF1
and children with refractory solid tumors treated on
phase I trials13 were observed. Patients with NF1, in
comparison to patients with cancer, were younger at
trial enrollment (median of 8 vs 14 years); had a bet-
ter performance status (56% having an ECOG of 0
vs 29%); had infrequently received prior myelosup-
pressive chemotherapy (5% vs 94%); had infre-
quently received prior
radiation therapy (3%
compared to 73%); remained on experimental ther-
apy longer (median [range] of 10 cycles [1–24] vs
median of 1 cycle [0 –31]); were removed from the
study for disease progression less frequently (42%
compared to 85%); and had longer survival (all but
one NF1 patient remained alive compared to a me-
dian survival of 5 months).

DISCUSSION The advent of molecularly targeted
anticancer drugs, which block signaling pathways re-
sponsible for the malignant phenotype in cancers,
and advances in knowledge of the signaling pathways
involved in NF1-related tumors has recently led to
the development of clinical trials of investigational
targeted agents in patients with NF1-related PN.
These clinical trials have generally used designs and
endpoints similar to those traditionally used for can-
cer clinical trials. In fact, 3 of the phase I trials in-
cluded in our analysis
simultaneously enrolled
children with refractory cancers or NF1-related PN
and defined the single MTD for children with NF1

or cancer.5,14,15 However, differences between indi-
viduals with refractory cancers and NF1-related PN
may require more disease-specific approaches to drug
development.

Our primary objectives for this analysis were to
describe the characteristics of pediatric patients en-
rolled in treatment trials for NF1-related PN, to un-
derstand the disease burden and associated
complications of their PN, to describe key outcomes
on completed trials, and to compare children with
NF1-related PN to children with refractory cancers

entering early phase clinical trials. Our study repre-
sents a single institution experience, which allowed
for the analysis of detailed subject information that
would be difficult to obtain from a review of pub-
lished trials. It is important to recognize that our
study inherently represents a skewed population, as
all patients were treated in a single institution on
clinical trials, which required PN to be progressive or
to have potential for morbidity. The characteristics
described here therefore cannot be generalized to all
children with NF1-related PN.

Although PN are benign tumors, they can cause
substantial morbidity, and may even be life-
threatening.1 This was confirmed in the patients en-
rolled in our clinical trials whose PN were large,
centrally located, and unresectable. A significant por-
tion of patients presented with pain and had PN
associated with the presence or the potential for life-
threatening complications such as airway or spinal
cord compression, physical deformity, or bodily dys-
function. Although the natural history of PN is not
fully understood, the eligibility criteria for the trials
included in this analysis selected a patient population
with substantial actual or potential morbidity that
could benefit from novel treatments to slow or re-
verse the manifestations of their disease, therefore
justifying the potential risks of participation in inves-
tigational treatment trials.

Phase I trials proved to be safe for children with
NF1-related PN. Toxicities were manageable and re-
versible. The DLT rate of 26% was similar to that
observed in children with refractory cancers on inves-
tigational drug trials.13,18 No life-threatening toxici-
ties were observed in children with NF1, and only 2
patients came off of study due to toxicity.

Compared to children with refractory cancers, the
NF1 population was younger, had better perfor-
mance status, had received less prior therapy, was on
study drug for longer durations, had different reasons
for discontinuing therapy, and survived the disease,
which is in contrast to the median survival of 5
months for children with refractory cancer who en-
roll in phase I trials.13 All but one patient with NF1
in this study remain alive, consistent with the obser-
vation that while the life expectancy in NF1 is de-
creased compared to the general population, with a
median lifespan of 59 years, most patients will reach
adulthood.19 In addition, in contrast to children with
refractory cancers, children with NF1 typically had
other NF1-related morbidity. These clinically signif-
icant differences highlight the need to evaluate the
applicability of trial design and endpoints for tradi-
tional pediatric cancer trials when developing trials
for children with NF1-related tumors. Children with
NF1-related PN should be evaluated for longer dura-

tions of therapy to determine tolerability, may re-
quire more conservative definitions of DLT, starting
doses, and dose escalation schedules, and require dif-
ferent outcome measures to assess drug activity.

The primary objectives of pediatric phase I trials
are to define the dose, PK, tolerance, and toxicity
profiles of investigational agents in children. Trials
performed in children with refractory cancers often
accrue a predominantly adolescent population, as ev-
idenced by the median age at enrollment.13 The NF1
trials provide data for these objectives in a younger
population, and these data from NF1 trials may also
be applicable to younger patients with cancer.

so studying these agents

Many of the molecularly targeted drugs under
evaluation for cancer and NF1-related PN alter sig-
naling pathways that play a role in normal growth
and development,
in
younger children during phase I testing is essential to
determine whether toxicities unique to growing chil-
dren may occur. For example, inhibition of angio-
genesis in growing but not aged animals resulted in
growth retardation and expanded epiphyseal growth
plates.20,21 This toxicity cannot be readily monitored

in children with refractory cancers on phase I trials
because they tend to be older, are more likely to have
closed growth plates, and typically remain on trial for
short periods.13,22 Evaluation of these agents in sepa-
rate phase I trials for children with NF1, who tend to
remain on study for multiple treatment cycles, there-
fore becomes necessary to carefully assess the drug for
effects on normal growth and development prior to
implementing larger phase II or III trials.

The ability to assess cumulative toxicity in children
enrolled in trials for NF1-related PN is an advantage for
including this population on phase I trials when there is
a strong scientific rationale for studying the drug in
NF1. This is particularly important for the develop-
ment of molecularly targeted drugs, which typically re-
quire oral administration on a chronic dosing schedule
and may require multiple treatment cycles to exhibit
toxic or therapeutic effects. The tipifarnib phase I trial,
for example, confirmed the absence of cumulative toxic-
ity in patients with NF1-related PN, and this supported
the rationale for the development of a phase II trial for
this population.5 Information about cumulative and
late toxicity and PK in children from NF1 trials of in-
vestigational agents that are also undergoing develop-
ment for cancer will benefit drug development for all
children as some of these agents may require chronic
administration for upfront treatment of childhood
cancers.

PN are slow-growing benign tumors,3 and the
molecularly targeted drugs being tested are more
likely to prevent PN growth than reduce the size of
these lesions. Therefore, children with NF1-related
PN may have to take active drugs for prolonged peri-
ods of time, and less severe toxicities (Common Ter-
minology Criteria grade 1 and 2), which would be
considered tolerable in the cancer population, may
become intolerable if present for prolonged intervals.
This is important to consider when defining DLT for
phase I trials in children with NF1-related PN.

Hypertension has been reported to be more prev-
alent in patients with NF1,23 and 8% of patients in
our cohort of 59 enrolled in clinical trials had a dia-
stolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile for
age. NF1 has also been associated with increased
prevalence of vascular and cerebrovascular
le-
sions.23,24 Hypertension is one of the most common
side effects of antiangiogenic drugs,25 such as the
VEGF receptor inhibitors that are currently in clini-
cal development for children with NF1-related PN.
Eligibility criteria for trials with antiangiogenic
agents should exclude patients with preexisting NF1-
related hypertension or cerebrovascular abnormali-
ties in order to limit potential serious toxicities.

The eligibility criteria of current clinical trials for
NF1-related PN select for a patient population with

substantial actual and potential morbidity from their
PN. Investigational agents were safely administered
to children with NF1 on early clinical trials. Differ-
ences between children with NF1-related PN and
with refractory cancers require careful consideration
for the design of future NF1 clinical trials.
