Background: Vismodegib, a ﬁrst-in-class Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, was US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved for advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) based on a single, nonrandomized,
phase-II trial. Consequently, additional clinical data are critical to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib.

Objective: We sought to assess efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib, while providing early drug access to
patients with advanced BCC and limited treatment options.

Methods: This was an open-label, multicenter study in patients with advanced BCC inappropriate
for radiotherapy or surgery. Patients received 150 mg vismodegib daily until disease progression or intolerable
toxicity. Tumor response was assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0.

Results: A total of 119 patients with advanced BCC took vismodegib for a median of 5.5 months. Objective
responses occurred in 46.4% of locally advanced BCC and 30.8% of patients with metastatic BCC. Response
was negatively associated with prior systemic therapy in patients with locally advanced BCC (P = .002).
Mean follow-up for safety was 6.5 months, with muscle spasms (70.6%), dysgeusia (70.6%), alopecia
(58.0%), and diarrhea (25.2%) as the most common adverse events.

Limitations: Abbreviated follow-up time because of study termination upon FDA approval was a limitation.

Conclusion: This study provides important clinical data supporting the efﬁcacy and safety of vismodegib.
Larger studies are underway to assess predictors of response and long-term outcomes. ( J Am Acad
Dermatol 2014;70:60-9.)

d Vismodegib was approved by the US

Food and Drug Administration for
advanced basal cell carcinoma after a
single phase-II clinical trial.

d To our knowledge, this is the largest

completed trial to date on vismodegib,
with 119 patients with this rare condition.

d This study confirms prior safety and
efficacy and explores clinical factors
associated with tumor response.

CAPSULE SUMMARY

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common
human malignancy, with an estimated 1.6 million
new patients treated in the United States in 2006.1-3
Most BCCs are effectively cured, but
in some
cases may progress to advanced BCC (refers to
both locally advanced and distantly metastatic
BCCs).4-6 Locally advanced BCCs can be debilitating
and lead to significant mor-
bidity.4,7,8 Surgery or radio-
therapy may be untenable
choices9,10 because of poten-
tial
function
with these treatments.7,11,12
In metastatic BCC, a rare but
often fatal condition, distant
metastases may preclude
surgery or radiation.6,13,14

loss of vital

Conventional chemother-
apy such as cisplatin has
been reported to improve tu-
mor response, but improve-
ments
in progression-free
survival or overall survival
have not been demonstrated.15 Chemotherapy has
also been examined as an adjuvant to radiation but
this has not demonstrated improved survival either.16
Hence, effective treatment
for advanced BCCs
represented a significant unmet medical need.

Aberrant Hedgehog pathway signaling, driven

is critical
in BCC pathogenesis.10,19,20 Loss of Patched contrib-
utes to approximately 90% of sporadic BCCs,
whereas SMO-activating mutations occur in approx-
imately 10% of sporadic BCCs.21-23 Hence, Hedgehog
pathway inhibitors represent a novel therapeutic op-
tion for BCC treatment.19,24

Vismodegib is the ﬁrst US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved oral, small-molecule,
Hedgehog pathway inhibitor effective in advanced
BCC.5,9,14,24,25 In a phase-II BCC study (ERIVANCE),
104 patients with advanced BCC received vismodegib,
with a 43% response in locally advanced BCC and a
30% response in metastatic BCC groups.14 Because of
significant unmet medical need in patients with
advanced BCC, vismodegib received priority FDA
approval after this phase-II clinical trial.26,27

Despite FDA approval, additional clinical data in a
greater number of patients with advanced BCC
are critical to conﬁrm the safety and efﬁcacy of
vismodegib. This study provided an opportunity for
patients with advanced BCC and limited treatment
options to receive early drug access. Furthermore,

this study is the largest peer-reviewed, published
study to date on vismodegib in patients with ad-
vanced BCC, allowing exploratory analysis of factors
that predict advanced BCC response to vismodegib.

with locally advanced BCC had at least 1 histologically
confirmed lesion 10 mm or larger in diameter with
written confirmation from a surgical specialist that
the tumor was inoperable, or that surgery was
contraindicated. Surgery was considered inappropri-
ate if BCC recurred in the same location after 2 or
more surgical procedures and curative resection was
deemed unlikely, or when there was substantial
morbidity and/or deformity anticipated. Patients
with locally advanced BCC were required to have
had prior radiation therapy to greater than or equal
to 1 target lesion unless contraindicated or inappro-
priate. Histologic confirmation of locally advanced
BCC and metastatic BCC lesion(s) was required in all
cases. Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome
(BCNS) could enroll if they met inclusion criteria.
Women of childbearing potential and men with
female partners of childbearing potential were re-
quired to use medically reliable contraception be-
cause of vismodegib teratogenicity.

initiation; had a history of other diseases or
uncontrolled medical illnesses that would contrain-
dicate vismodegib; were on concurrent antitumor
therapy; or had a less than 12-week life expectancy.

Study design

This was an open-label, 2-cohort, multicenter
study. All patients received 150 mg oral vismodegib
once daily, with treatment cycles deﬁned as every 28
days. Clinic visits occurred every 1 to 2 treatment
cycles. The clinic visits included medical history;
adverse event (AE) recording; ascertainment of con-
comitant medications; ECOG performance status;
vital signs including weight; physical examination;
complete blood cell count and metabolic panel;
and urinalysis. Screening electrocardiography was
also performed. Treatment was
administered
until
investigator-assessed disease progression,
unmanageable toxicities, patient or physician
request
to discontinue, or study termination by
sponsor. Dose reduction was not permitted. Dose
interruption up to 8 weeks was permitted to manage
toxicity.

Safety analysis/assessment

The

population

type,

safety-evaluable

included
patients receiving greater than or equal to 1 vismo-
degib dose. Safety was assessed by AE collection
including incidence,
severity, vismodegib
discontinuation/interruption because of AEs, and
on-study deaths
(drug and nondrug related).
Descriptions of all collected AEs were mapped to
Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities terms
(version 15.0) and graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 4.0)
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/
CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_
8.5x11.pdf).

Efﬁcacy analysis/assessment

Patients receiving greater than or equal to 1 dose
of vismodegib and having greater than or equal to
1 follow-up tumor assessment (or who died within

initiation,

30 days of ﬁrst dose of vismodegib) were included in
the efﬁcacy-evaluable population. Tumor responses
were investigator-assessed according to RECIST
version 1.0 criteria. Physical examinations were
performed to assess measurable tumors within 7
days of treatment initiation, then every 4 to 8 weeks.
Patients with radiographically measurable disease
underwent computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging assessment within 30 days before
treatment
then every 8 to 16 weeks
thereafter. Patients with nonmeasurable disease, eg,
bone metastases, were evaluated for disease
progression by the clinical judgment of the treating
physician. Objective tumor responses, deﬁned as the
best overall complete response or partial response,
were conﬁrmed by investigators using 2 consecutive
tumor assessments performed at least 4 weeks apart
according to RECIST version 1.0. For instance, if a
tumor had a partial response followed by complete
response but no second assessment of complete
response, the tumor was labeled as partial response.
For this study, appearance of a new cutaneous BCC
was considered progressive disease if the lesion was
larger than 5 mm and clearly documented as not
previously present.

Statistical analysis

Patient data were collected through 30 days after
the last vismodegib dose for the last patient enrolled.
Efﬁcacy and safety data were summarized by
descriptive statistics. The association between tumor
response and selected baseline characteristics of age,
prior radiotherapy exposure, prior systemic cancer
therapy, and number of involved sites was evaluated
using Fisher exact test.

RESULTS
Patient demographics and baseline
characteristics

In all, 120 patients (locally advanced BCC n = 62,
metastatic BCC n = 58) enrolled at 11 US sites. Of
these, 119 patients (locally advanced BCC n = 62,
metastatic BCC n = 57) were safety-evaluable and 95
(locally advanced BCC n = 56, metastatic BCC n = 39)
were efﬁcacy-evaluable (Fig 1). Demographic and
baseline characteristics were similar for both locally
advanced BCC and metastatic BCC cohorts (Table I).
RECIST-measurable disease at baseline comprised
87.4% of patients enrolled. The remaining 12.6% of
patients had biopsy-proven metastatic BCC to bone,
classified as nonmeasurable disease by RECIST
version 1.0, but evaluable on imaging. Seven patients
with BCNS had biopsy-proven distantly metastatic
BCC.

termination. The median duration of vismodegib
treatment was 5.5 (range 0.4-19.6) months. The
mean received dose was approximately 95% of
planned. The median safety follow-up was 6.5
(range 1.4-20.6) months. The relatively short median
duration of vismodegib treatment was reﬂective
of FDA approval, at which point
the sponsor
terminated the study and patients were transitioned
to commercially available vismodegib. The sponsor
study termination was the primary reason for
discontinuation. Of the 120 patients enrolled, 79
(locally advanced BCC n = 44, metastatic BCC n = 35)
were transitioned to commercial drug. Other
reasons for study discontinuation included disease
progression (n = 16), subject decision (n = 7), loss to
follow-up (n = 6), and AEs (n = 5).
Adverse events. Almost all

safety-evaluable
patients (n = 116; 97.5%) experienced a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE). These were typically grades
1 and 2, with few patients experiencing AEs of grade
3 (n = 24), grade 4 (n = 9), and grade 5 (death; n = 2).
Common ( $ 15% incidence) TEAEs are listed in
Table II. The median time to onset of common TEAEs
was generally less than 60 days after treatment

cycles

initiation; however, alopecia and decreased weight
had longer onset times (median 87 and 175 days,
respectively). Most TEAEs
(eg, muscle spasm,
dysgeusia, alopecia) occurred within the first 7
treatment
(Fig 2). Among women of
childbearing potential
(n = 8), 4 developed
amenorrhea or irregular menses; 1 patient had
amenorrhea for longer than 6 months (grade 3),
1 patient for more than 3 to 6 months (grade 2), and 2
patients for 1 to 3 months (grade 1). All amenorrhea
AEs were ongoing at study termination.

Serious AEs, TEAE-related withdrawal, and
study deaths. Eighteen patients (locally advanced
BCC n = 9, metastatic BCC n = 9) reported serious AEs
that were grade 3 (n = 12), grade 4 (n = 6), or grade 5
(n = 2). Muscle spasm (n = 1, grade 3) was the only
vismodegib-related serious AE reported. Seven
patients discontinued vismodegib because of AEs
(2 were drug related and 5 unrelated).
In the
locally advanced BCC cohort, TEAEs leading to
discontinuation included 1 patient each with wound
complication, muscle spasm, worsening/recurrence
of pre-existing conditions such as B-cell lymphoma,
mesothelioma, and squamous cell carcinoma. In the
metastatic BCC cohort, AEs leading to treatment
discontinuation included 1 patient with fatigue and

study patients) achieved partial response (locally
advanced BCC n = 20, metastatic BCC n = 10). In all,
47 patients (49.5% of all study patients) experienced
stable disease (locally advanced BCC n = 27,
metastatic BCC n = 20). In total, 94.6% patients in
the locally advanced BCC cohort and 82.1% patients
in the metastatic BCC cohort had complete response,
partial response, or stable disease. No patient with
locally advanced BCC had progressive disease,
whereas 3 patients with metastatic BCC exhibited
progressive disease (Table III).

Illustrative patient case studies

Case study 1: Differential shrinkage in locally
advanced BCCs after retreatment with vismodegib.
An 84-year-old man with a long history of locally
advanced BCCs enrolled in the current expanded

access study after a 9-month course of vismodegib
(150 mg daily) through the phase-II clinical trial
(ERIVANCE BCC). Left scalp and preauricular locally
advanced BCCs achieved partial response and he
discontinued from ERIVANCE 7 months earlier for
personal reasons. In the current study, target lesions
on the left ear and left chin demonstrated a partial
response, and the nontarget left scalp and preauric-
ular locally advanced BCCs demonstrated complete
response and visible tumor shrinkage (Fig 4, A),
respectively, after 8 months of retreatment. Hence,
retreatment can be beneficial but responses to
vismodegib in different BCCs within an individual
can vary.

Case study 2*: Periocular BCCs in a patient with
BCNS shows complete response. A 55-year-old man
with BCNS presented with multiple locally advanced
BCCs* including 2 periocular BCCseright medial
canthus and left lateral canthus (Fig 4, B I)eand a
13-cm BCC on the right scalp eroding calvarium. The
patient received 150 mg vismodegib once daily. His
periocular lesions responded with complete regres-
sion. He continued on vismodegib after study termi-
nation and the periocular lesions have remained
clear without evidence of disease at 24 months

*Note: Additional description of the scalp BCC has been published
in JAMA Dermatology (Vignette section) 2013;149:639-41.

negative margins. This case illustrates the use of
vismodegib in periocular lesions where surgery may
risk vision loss.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge,

this is the largest peer-
reviewed, published study to date of vismodegib in
advanced BCCs. In light of priority review and
approval of vismodegib by the FDA based on a single
phase-II study,14 this study contributes important
additional data confirming the safety and efficacy of
vismodegib for advanced BCCs. The observed safety
profile based on incidence and severity of AEs is
comparable with the phase-II study with no new
safety signals observed. Longer follow-up times will
be critical
long-term outcomes and
the safety profile of vismodegib treatment. The
international vismodegib safety study, STEVIE
(NCT01367665), which aims to enroll 1200 patients,
will likely address these important questions.

between the 2 studies. First, this expanded access
study used RECIST criteria for both cohorts and did
not use independent review to assess the tumor
responses to vismodegib. Second, a few patients
(6 of 119) in this study had been exposed to an SMO
inhibitor before enrollment, which was not the case
in the phase-II study.

Data on clinical

factors that predict ORR, as
explored in this study, will be useful for clinicians
to identify patients with advanced BCC most likely to
beneﬁt from vismodegib. Although this study has a
relatively small sample size for ORR predictions, a
prospective, observational, US disease registry
(RegiSONIC; NCT01604252) is currently underway
to assess effects of different treatments in advanced
BCC and may provide additional data about
predictors of tumor response.

treatment

In conclusion,

this study provides important
additional clinical data supporting vismodegib as a
useful
for advanced BCCs. Given the
complexity of many of these patients, and the recent
availability of vismodegib for commercial use,
multidisciplinary efforts
among dermatologists,
medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, otolaryn-
gologists, and surgical oncologists may be needed to
optimize patient outcomes.

The authors would like to thank all the patients and
their families for participating in this study. The authors
