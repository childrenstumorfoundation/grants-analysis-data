Summary

Notch is a critical component of evolutionarily con-
served signaling mechanisms that regulate develop-
ment [1] and may contribute to plasticity-related pro-
cesses, including changes in neurite structure [2] and
maintenance of neural stem cells [3]. Deficits in the
Notch pathway are responsible for Alagille [4] and Ca-
dasil syndromes [5], which are associated with mental
retardation and dementia. Additionally, in postmitotic
neurons, Notch proteins interact with presenilins [6-9]
and with ␤-amyloid precursor protein [10] and could
therefore have a role in the memory deficits associated
with familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. To test
if alterations in Notch signaling can lead to learning
and memory deficits, we studied mice with mutations
in this pathway. Here, we show that null heterozygous
mutations in Notch1 result in deficits in spatial learning
and memory without affecting other forms of learning,
motor control, or exploratory activity. We also show
that null heterozygous mutations in the downstream
cofactor RBP-J result in similarly specific spatial
learning and memory deficits. These data indicate that
a constitutive decrease in Notch signaling can result
in specific learning and memory deficits and suggest
that abnormalities in Notch-dependent transcription
may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated
with Alzheimer’s disease and Alagille and Cadasil syn-
dromes.

Results and Discussion

Besides its critical role in neuronal development, the
Notch pathway may also function in the adult brain and
may control processes such as neuritic growth [2] and
neural stem cell pool maintenance [3], which have been
related to cognitive function [11–14]. In postmitotic adult

brain neurons, Notch molecules are coexpressed and
interact with presenilins (PS), which have been impli-
cated in familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) [6–9]. PS are
a critical component of ␥-secretase and are required for
the cleavage and nuclear access of the transcriptionally
active Notch intracellular domain, and mutations in PS
result in altered Notch processing and in a neurogenic
phenotype [6, 7, 15, 16]. This PS-dependent cleavage
is essential for Notch’s role in neurite outgrowth inhibi-
tion [17, 18] and maintenance of neural stem cells [3].
Gamma-secretase/PS also cleaves ␤-amyloid precursor
protein (APP), generating ␤-amyloid in AD [19], and the
transcriptionally active APP intracellular domain (AID),
which interacts and inhibits the Notch intracellular do-
main [10, 20, 21]. Inhibitors of ␥-secretase have been
developed as possible therapeutic strategies for AD.
Interestingly, the majority of these inhibitors also down-
regulate Notch signaling and impair Notch function [18,
22, 23]. Even ␥-secretase inhibitors that could specifi-
cally target APP cleavage would result in diminished
generation of the APP intracellular domain and could
alter Notch signaling [10].

To evaluate the effects of decreasing Notch signaling
in brain function and more specifically in learning and
memory, we used mice carrying a heterozygous null
mutation in the Notch1 gene (Notch1⫹/⫺, homozygotes
are lethal [24]). Despite a constitutively hypofunctional
Notch pathway, these mice are viable, healthy, and do
not have obvious developmental deficits. Although they
exhibit a transient premature myelination of small-cali-
ber axons, they have normal myelination and brain archi-
tecture in adulthood [25]. In the studies described here,
we used animals older than 60 days, an age at which
myelination is already normal in these mice [25].

Because Notch1 is expressed in the hippocampus
[2, 8] and deficits in this brain region have been impli-
cated in the cognitive abnormalities associated with AD,
we tested the Notch1⫹/⫺ mice in the hidden version of
the water maze; performance in this task is known to
be sensitive to hippocampal lesions [26]. In this spatial
navigation task, animals learn to locate a submerged
platform in a pool filled with opaque water. During train-
ing, mice were given six trials a day (three sessions of
two trials, 30 s intertrial interval [ITI]) for 5 days. Because
the time animals take to reach the platform during train-
ing is not a very sensitive measure of spatial learning
[27], we gave the mice probe trials (days 3 and 5), where
the platform was removed from the pool and the mice
were allowed to search for it for 60 s. During training,
all animals showed an improvement in the time they
took to find the platform (F14,378 ⫽ 15.2, p ⬍ 0.05), and
no difference was found between Notch1⫹/⫺ mice and
wild-type (WT) littermates (F1,27 ⫽ 1.09, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure
1A). However, during the first probe trial, given after
3 days of training, there was a significant interaction
between genotype and the percentage of time spent in
each quadrant of the pool (F3,81 ⫽ 3.72, p ⬍ 0.05). WT
mice searched significantly longer in the quadrant where
the platform was during training (training quadrant [TQ])

Learning and Memory Deficits in Notch Mutant Mice

than Notch1⫹/⫺ mice (F1,27 ⫽ 6.26, p ⬍ 0.05; Figure 1C).
Additionally, while WT mice searched significantly
longer in the TQ than in the other quadrants (F3,56 ⫽
30.6, p ⬍ 0.05, posthoc tests Fisher’s PLSD, p ⬍ 0.05),
Notch1⫹/⫺ did not (F3,52 ⫽ 2.55, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 1C).
Using another very sensitive measure of spatial learning
[28], we confirmed that WT mice searched on average
closer to the exact platform position than to the corre-
sponding positions in the other quadrants of the pool
(F3,56 ⫽ 17.84, p ⬍ 0.05; posthoc, p ⬍ 0.05), while mutants
did not (F3,52 ⫽ 1.063, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 1D). No differences
in swimming speed (WT ⫽ 19.3 ⫾ 0.58, Notch1⫹/⫺ ⫽
19.0 ⫾ 1.10, F1,27 ⫽ 0.07, p ⬎ 0.05), floating, or thigmo-
taxic behavior (data not shown) were observed between
WT and Notch1⫹/⫺ mice. Altogether, these data demon-
strate that the Notch1⫹/⫺ mutation impaired spatial
learning.

Importantly, with extended training, Notch1⫹/⫺ mice
also learned to search selectively for the missing plat-
form. During a probe trial given after 5 days of training,
Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants spent the same amount of time
searching in the TQ as did WT mice (F1,27 ⫽ 0.05, p ⬎
0.05; Figure 1E). Consistently, both mutants (F3,52 ⫽ 6.21)
and WT (F3,56 ⫽ 11.8) searched on average closer to the
exact platform position than to the other positions in
the pool (posthocs, p ⬍ 0.05; Figure 1F). Notch1⫹/⫺ mice
could remember as well as WT mice the position of the
platform for 8 (F1,27 ⫽ 1.89, p ⬎ 0.05) or 45 days (F1,21 ⫽
0.31, p ⬎ 0.05; data not shown).

We also assessed reversal learning and memory in
the water maze. Mice were first trained as described
above and were then tested for their ability to learn a
different platform position. Importantly, to ensure that
differences in the initial training in the water maze did
not confound reversal testing, we used a group of WT
and Notch1⫹/⫺ mice with matched performances at the
end of the initial training. These mice were trained to
find a new platform position during 12 consecutive trials
(30-s intertrial) and were subjected to a probe trial imme-
diately after training (30 s, short term [ST]) or 48 hr
later (long term). During training in this novel position,
Notch1⫹/⫺ mice learned the new platform position normally
(F1,25 ⫽ 0.57, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 1G), and they searched
significantly longer for the missing platform in the new
training quadrant than in the other quadrants (p ⬍ 0.05),
as did WT mice (p ⬍ 0.05; Figure 1H). However, 48 hr
later, Notch1⫹/⫺ mice no longer searched preferentially
in the training quadrant, while WT still did (p ⬍ 0.05 for
all quadrants). WT mice searched similarly for the new
TQ immediately and 48 hr later (t13 ⫽ 2.04, p ⬎ 0.05),
while Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants searched significantly less in
the TQ at 48 hr (t12 ⫽ 4.07, p ⬍ 0.05). This finding indicates
that they forgot the new platform position. Interestingly,
48 hr after reversal training, Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants searched
longer in the original training quadrant (marked as t,
Figure 1H) than immediately after training (t12 ⫽ ⫺3.1,
p ⬍ 0.05). This finding indicates that, as they forgot
the new platform position, they showed a tendency to
search in the original training quadrant. Taken together,
these data suggest that the Notch1⫹/⫺ mutation impairs
the formation of long-term spatial memories.

To determine whether deficits in motivation, visual
acuity, or motor coordination could account for the ab-

normalities in spatial learning, a group of animals was
tested in the visible platform version of the water maze;
performance in this task is not affected by hippocampal
lesions [26]. Both mutant and WT control mice learned
this task similarly, since the times taken to reach the
visible platform were not different between the groups
(F1,10 ⫽ 0.63, p ⬎ 0.05) (Figure 1B).

Since Notch1 is expressed in the cerebellum [8] and
this structure is known to have a role in motor function,
we tested the Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants on a rota-rod, which
tests motor coordination and motor learning [29]. We
gave the animals five trials (300 s each) with a 5-min
intertrial interval on an accelerating rota-rod (4–40 rpm)
and measured the time it took for the mice to fall off.
All subjects showed an increase in the latency to fall
across trials (F1,17 ⫽ 13.3, p ⬍ 0.05; Figure 2), and no
difference was observed between WT and Notch1⫹/⫺
mice in the performance of the task (F1,17 ⫽ 4.84, p ⬍
0.05). Memory for this task was intact after 1 day or 20
days, indicating that motor coordination, motor learning,
and motor memory were not disrupted in Notch1⫹/⫺ mice
(Figure 2).

Next, we tested the specificity of the spatial learning
deficits of the Notch1⫹/⫺ mice. Notch1⫹/⫺ mice were nor-
mal in a range of other different and dissociable hippo-
campal-dependent tests [30] (contextual conditioning,
contextual discrimination [31], passive avoidance [32],
and social recognition [33]). They were also normal in
nonhippocampal forms of classical conditioning, such
as cued conditioning [31]. Notch1⫹/⫺ mice showed nor-
mal exploratory activity in a conditioning chamber [34]
and in an open field [29, 35]; normal anxiety when tested
in an open field by measuring area occupancy and defe-
cation; and normal muscular coordination (gait), muscu-
lar strength (wire hang), body weight, eye blink reflex,
reaching and grasping behaviors, and other neurological
tests [35] (Table 1). This extensive behavioral analysis
demonstrates the specificity of the spatial learning defi-
cits described for the Notch1⫹/⫺ mice, and they indicate
that they are not caused by gross neurological abnor-
malities.

The Notch pathway can signal through a CBF1/
RBP-J-dependent pathway (transcriptionally active) or
a CBF1/RBP-J-independent pathway [36]. RBP-J is acti-
vated by all four Notch receptors (not only by Notch1),
and therefore mutations in this transcription factor
should impair Notch signaling more severely than
Notch1 mutations [37]. To determine if alterations in the
CBF1/RBP-J-dependent pathway affect spatial learn-
ing, we tested RBP-J null heterozygous mice (RBP-J⫹/⫺,
homozygotes die in utero [38]) in the hidden version
of the water maze. These mice had a similar genetic
background and were trained by using the same proce-
dures as described above for the Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants.
During training, all animals showed an improvement in
the time taken to find the platform (F14,406 ⫽ 16.3, p ⬍
0.05), but there was a significant interaction between
session and genotype (F1,14 ⫽ 16.3, p ⬍ 0.05); RBP-
J⫹/⫺ were significantly slower to learn the task than WT
littermates (F1,29 ⫽ 12.1, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 3A). During the
probe trial given after 3 days of training, the WT mice
spent significantly more time searching for the platform
in the TQ than RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice (F1,29 ⫽ 7.13, p ⬍ 0.05;

Mice were trained for 5 trials (300 s each), with a 5-min ITI on an
accelerating rota-rod (4–40 rpm), and the time it took for the mice
to fall off was measured. Memory for this task was assessed after
1 day or 20 days (three trials, 5-min ITI). There was no difference
between WT (n ⫽ 11) and Notch1⫹/⫺ (n ⫽ 8) mice in acquisition or
memory of the task.

Figure 3C). Furthermore, WT mice searched closer to
the exact platform position than to the corresponding
positions in the other pool quadrants (F3,56 ⫽ 5.63, p ⬍
0.05 for all quadrants); while RBP-J⫹/⫺ littermates did
not (F3,60 ⫽ 2.75, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 3D). No differences in
swimming speed (WT ⫽ 20.5 ⫾ 1.13; RBP-J⫹/⫺ ⫽ 20.9 ⫾
0.81, F1,29 ⫽ 0.11, p ⬎ 0.05), floating, or thigmotaxic
behavior (data not shown) were observed between WT
and RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice. With additional training, the RBP-
J⫹/⫺ mice learned to search selectively for the missing
platform (F3,60 ⫽ 8.26, p ⬍ 0.05, Figure 3E; F3,60 ⫽ 6.71,
p ⬍ 0.05, Figure 3F) and did not significantly differ from
WT in time spent searching in TQ (F1,29 ⫽ 2.393, p ⬎ 0.05,
Figure 3E); although, they still searched for considerably
less time in TQ than WT (35.6 ⫾ 2.75 versus 41.8 ⫾
2.87). Because of this apparent difference in perfor-
mance even after overtraining, we did not perform a
reversal training task, since we could not ensure that
differences in the initial water maze training would not
confound the reversal testing. The spatial learning defi-
cits observed in the RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice did not arise from

motivation, motor coordination, or visual acuity prob-
lems since both mutant and WT mice learned the visible
task similarly (F1,13 ⫽ 0.35, p ⬎ 0.05; Figure 3B). Also,
the phenotype of the RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice seemed more se-
vere than that of the Notch1⫹/⫺ mice. The RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice
had impairments that were already apparent during the
acquisition of the task, while Notch1⫹/⫺ mice did not, a
finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that RBP-
J-dependent signaling of all Notch receptors is compro-
mised in these mice.

Similarly to Notch1⫹/⫺ mice, the spatial learning defi-
cits of the RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice were very specific. Other hip-
pocampal-dependent tasks, such as contextual condi-
tioning (24 hr: 28.8 ⫾ 7.86 versus 29.7 ⫾ 6.18; 7 days:
20.9 ⫾ 5.49 versus 16.2 ⫾ 4.89), were indistinguishable
between WT and RBP-J⫹/⫺, even when using a very
sensitive protocol to assess hippocampal function [39],
with only a 20-s interval between placement in the con-
text and delivery of the shock (24.6 ⫾ 6.44 versus 24.5 ⫾
7.1). Also, nonhippocampal forms of pavlovian condi-
tioning, such as tone conditioning (41.7 ⫾ 9.44 versus
36.8 ⫾ 8.85), anxiety and baseline exploratory activity
(32.9 ⫾ 6.35 versus 35.4 ⫾ 4.96), and a variety of neuro-
logical measures assessing muscular coordination,
muscular strength, eye blink reflex, and reaching and
grasping (data not shown), were also indistinguishable
between WT and RBP-J⫹/⫺ mice.

The results presented here demonstrate that a chronic
decrease in Notch1 function results in spatial learning
deficits and suggest that Notch-dependent transcription
is critical for spatial learning. The exquisite specificity
of these learning and memory deficits argues against
the possibility that the mutations studied result in gross
developmental abnormalities that could account for the
learning deficits. Also, we observed long-term spatial
memory deficits in experiments in which Notch mutant
mice had normal acquisition and short-term spatial
memory. This strongly argues against a general deficit
in hippocampal information processing and points to-
ward a specific functional deficit due to changes in
Notch signaling. It is important to notice that previous
studies have shown that different hippocampal-depen-
dent functions are differentially affected by hippocampal
manipulations [30, 40]. Our results with heterozygotes
indicate that Notch mutations affect a specific domain
of hippocampal function that is especially important for
spatial learning and memory, but it is possible that com-

is shown. WT mice searched selectively since they spent significantly more time searching in the training quadrant (TQ, black bars) than in
any of the other quadrants, while Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants did not search selectively in any of the quadrants (adjacent left [AL], adjacent right [AR],
and opposite [OP], white and shaded bars). Also, WT mice spent significantly more time searching in the training quadrant than Notch1⫹/⫺
mice (44.6 ⫾ 3.15 versus 31.7 ⫾ 4.08).
(D) A different measure to assess selective searching during the same day 3 probe trial. WT mice searched on average closer to the exact
position of the platform during training (TQ, black bars) than to the corresponding positions in the other quadrants, while mutants did not.
(E) A probe trial given after 5 days of training. Both mutants spent significantly more time searching in the training quadrant than in any of
the other quadrants, and they spent similar time searching in the training quadrant.
(F) Average proximity during the same day 5 probe trial. Both mutants and WT searched on average closer to the exact platform position
than to the other positions in the pool.
(G) Acquisition of a new platform position during reversal learning (12 consecutive trials, 30-s ITI). No differences between Notch1⫹/⫺ (n ⫽ 13)
and WT (n ⫽ 14) mice were observed in reversal acquisition.
(H) During a probe trial given 30 s (short term [ST]) after reversal training, both Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants and WT mice searched longer in the TQ
than in the any of the other quadrants. WT mice remembered the new platform position for at least 48 hr, while Notch1⫹/⫺ mice did not.
Interestingly, Notch1⫹/⫺ mutants searched longer in the original training quadrant (marked with a t) 48 hr after reversal training than immediately
after training.

Other hippocampal functions different than spatial navigation, such as place (contextual conditioning, contextual discrimination, and passive
avoidance) and social recognition, and nonhippocampal functions, such as cued conditioning, are unaffected in Notch1 mutants. Exploratory
activity (chamber and open field activity) and anxiety (open field occupancy and defecation) are also normal. Muscular coordination (gait) and
muscular strength (wire hang) are unaffected.

plete deletions would result in more generalized deficits.
Also, it is conceivable that very specific and undetected
neuroanatomical changes taking place during develop-
ment account for the specific spatial learning deficits of
the RBP-J⫹/⫺ and Notch1⫹/⫺ mice. Even if this would
be the case, the findings presented here would still be
important for understanding the deficits associated with
Alagille and Cadasil syndromes and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. However, in agreement with our conclusions, re-
ducing Notch function specifically in adult Drosophila
leads to progressive neurological dysfunction [41].

The results presented here also have important impli-
cations for the development of therapeutic strategies
for AD. Moreover, they may help us to understand the
mechanisms associated with the generation of cognitive
deficits in AD. Both increased PS-dependent cleavage
of Notch in FAD and increased APP signaling trough
AID in sporadic AD [7, 10] can result in altered Notch
signaling. It is possible that the synaptic loss and the
synaptic dysfunction observed in AD [42], which corre-
late with the cognitive deficits, could result from an inter-
action between the effects of extracellular soluble
␤-amyloid and intracellular alterations in Notch and APP
signaling [21, 43].

In conclusion, our results are consistent with the hy-
pothesis that Notch signaling is involved in learning and
memory processes in the adult brain, and they suggest
that abnormalities in Notch-dependent transcription
may contribute to the learning and memory deficits as-
sociated with Alzheimer’s disease and Alagille and Ca-
dasil syndromes.

Experimental Procedures

Animals
The generation of the different genetically modified mice was de-
scribed before [24, 38]. The Notch1⫹/⫺ population was backcrossed
eight generations into the C57BL/6J background from the original
genetic background. The RBP-J⫹/⫺ population was backcrossed 13
generations into the C57BL/6N background from the original genetic
background. In every experiment, we used isogenic littermates, ex-

cept for the genes of interest. Genotyping was done by PCR. All
experiments were done blind with respect to genotype and were
conducted with the approval of the UCLA Animal Research Commit-
tee of the Chancellor’s Office of Protection of Research.

Behavioral Tasks
The basic water maze protocols and equipment are described else-
where [29]. Each water maze experiment was replicated three times
with different groups of about six mutants and six WT littermates.
The contextual conditioning (2 s, 0.75 mA, 150 s placement to shock
interval, unless indicated otherwise), tone conditioning (30 s, 85
dB, 2.8 kHz tone coterminating with the shock), and contextual
discrimination experiments were performed as previously described
[29, 31] and by using computer-assisted assessment of freezing
[34]. Passive avoidance was performed as previously described [32]:
a 2-s 0.75 mA shock was delivered after the animal completely
entered the dark chamber and the communication door was closed,
and a 600 s test period occurred 24 hr later. The social recognition
task was performed according to [33], and the roto-rod and other
motor and exploratory tasks were performed as described in [29].

Statistical Analysis
A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze
the acquisition data from the water maze and rota-rod tasks and to
investigate possible interactions between quadrant occupancy and
genotype during probe trials. Single-factor ANOVA was used to
analyze the effect of the quadrant in both occupancy and proximity,
and posthoc comparisons (Fisher’s PLSD) between quadrants were
performed when there was an effect of quadrant. Comparison be-
tween mutants and WT for all the other measures described (includ-
ing TQ occupancy) was also done by using single-factor ANOVA.
