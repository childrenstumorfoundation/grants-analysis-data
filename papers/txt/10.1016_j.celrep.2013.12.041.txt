SUMMARY

Cancer therapy exerts a strong selection pressure
that shapes tumor evolution, yet our knowledge of
how tumors change during treatment is limited.
Here, we report the analysis of cellular heterogeneity
for genetic and phenotypic features and their spatial
distribution in breast tumors pre- and post-neoadju-
vant chemotherapy. We found that intratumor ge-
netic diversity was tumor-subtype speciﬁc, and it
did not change during treatment in tumors with
partial or no response. However, lower pretreatment
genetic diversity was signiﬁcantly associated with
pathologic complete response. In contrast, pheno-
typic diversity was different between pre- and post-
treatment samples. We also observed signiﬁcant
changes in the spatial distribution of cells with

distinct genetic and phenotypic features. We used
these experimental data to develop a stochastic
computational model to infer tumor growth patterns
and evolutionary dynamics. Our results highlight
the importance of integrated analysis of genotypes
and phenotypes of single cells in intact tissues to
predict tumor evolution.

INTRODUCTION

Intratumor phenotypic heterogeneity is a deﬁning characteristic
of human tumors. Cancer cells within a tumor can display differ-
ences in many measurable traits, such as proliferative and
metastatic capacity and therapeutic resistance (Almendro
et al., 2013; Fidler, 1978; Heppner and Miller, 1983; Maley
et al., 2006; Marusyk et al., 2012; Yap et al., 2012). Multiple
mechanisms underlie intratumor heterogeneity, including both

heritable and nonheritable determinants (Fidler, 1978; Heppner
and Miller, 1983; Maley et al., 2006; Marusyk et al., 2012; Maru-
syk and Polyak, 2010; Yap et al., 2012). In addition, cellular ge-
netic diversity was observed within populations of tumor cells
that is distinct from clonal diversity because it combines inputs
from both clonal architecture and lower-scale differences arising
from genomic instability that are not ampliﬁed by selection
(Maley et al., 2006; Merlo et al., 2006). The study and treatment
of cancer are complicated by this heterogeneity because small
tissue samples, typically obtained by biopsy, may not be repre-
sentative of the whole tumor (Gerlinger et al., 2012), and a treat-
ment that targets one tumor cell population may not be effective
against another (Turner and Reis-Filho, 2012; Yap et al., 2012).
Quantitative measures of intratumor heterogeneity might aid in
the clinical management of patients with cancer including iden-
tifying those at a high risk of progression and recurrence. For
example, a larger extent of intratumor clonal heterogeneity is
associated with a higher risk of invasive progression in Barrett’s
esophagus (Maley et al., 2006; Merlo et al., 2010), and higher
genetic heterogeneity in head and neck squamous carcinomas
is related to worse outcome (Mroz et al., 2013). The presence
of multiple cellular clones with distinct genetic alterations has
also been implicated in therapeutic resistance (Engelman et al.,
2007; Mroz et al., 2013; Nazarian et al., 2010; Sakai et al.,
2008) and in metastatic progression (Fidler, 1978).

Cancer therapy exerts a strong selection pressure that shapes
tumor evolution (Merlo et al., 2006). Thus, residual tumors after
treatment are likely to have different, frequently less-favorable
characteristics and composition than those of the diagnostic
sample. Despite the importance of these treatment-induced
changes for the success of subsequent therapy, tumors have
been rarely resampled and reanalyzed, with the exception of he-
matopoietic malignancies (Ding et al., 2012; Landau et al., 2013).
Thus, our understanding of how treatment impacts intratumor
heterogeneity and cellular diversity in solid tumors, which then
in turn determines the effectiveness of treatment, is very limited.
The most informative approach to uncover intratumor hetero-
geneity in clinical samples is the deﬁnition of the overall clonal
architecture within a tumor. However, this level of resolution is
not practically feasible. A lower-resolution view of clonal archi-
tecture can be outlined based on computational
inferences
from allele frequencies of whole-genome sequencing of bulk
tumors (Ding et al., 2012) or by low-resolution sequencing of sin-
gle cancer cells (Navin et al., 2011). Unfortunately, both of these
approaches have many technical caveats and are prohibitively
expensive to apply for large patient cohorts.

An alternative to the whole-genome studies is to study genetic
diversity using a single or a few genomic loci. Although this
approach cannot reveal the clonal architecture within a tumor,
it is more feasible due to minimal sample requirements and low
cost. Importantly, diversity indices calculated based on a limited
number of loci (even selectively neutral ones) have been shown
to predict clinical outcome (Maley et al., 2006; Merlo et al.,
2010). Cellular heterogeneity reﬂects both clonal heterogeneity
and genetic instability; thus, it can be impacted by anticancer
therapy on several levels. First, the new selective pressures are
expected to favor relatively treatment-resistant clonal sub-
populations over sensitive ones,
therefore limiting clonal
diversity. Second, genotoxic treatments may elevate genomic
instability, thereby potentially increasing cellular genetic diver-
sity. Despite its clinical
impact of
cancer therapy on cellular genetic heterogeneity is largely un-
known. Here, we report the effects of neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy on the extent of genetic and phenotypic cellular diversity
within breast tumors and the associations between intratumor
genetic heterogeneity and therapeutic outcomes.

RESULTS

Tumor-Subtype- and Cancer Cell-Type-Speciﬁc
Differences in Genetic Diversity
To investigate relationships between intratumor heterogeneity
and cancer therapy, we analyzed pre- and posttreatment tumor
biopsies from 47 patients with breast cancer undergoing neoad-
juvant chemotherapy (Table S1). These included 13 luminal A, 11
luminal B, 11 HER2+, and 12 TNBC (triple-negative breast
cancer) tumors representing each of the major breast tumor
subtypes (Perou et al., 2000). Four patients showed pathologic
complete response (pCR) to treatment; thus, in these cases,
posttreatment samples could not be analyzed.

Genetic heterogeneity was assessed based on immuno-
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) using BAC (bacterial
artiﬁcial chromosome) probes for 8q24.3, 10p13, 16p13.3, and
20q13.31 and the corresponding centromeric probes (CEPs)
to distinguish between gain of whole chromosomes versus
speciﬁc chromosomal
regions. These genomic loci were
selected because they are the most commonly ampliﬁed chro-
mosomal regions in breast cancer regardless of tumor subtype
(e.g., 8q24) or within a speciﬁc tumor subtype (Nikolsky et al.,
2008). Phenotypic heterogeneity was assessed by staining for
CD44 and CD24 (Figure 1A) because prior studies from our
and other laboratories demonstrated that these cell surface

markers identify cancer cells with distinct molecular and biolog-
ical properties (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Bloushtain-Qimron et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2007; Shipitsin et al., 2007),
including genetic heterogeneity both between and within
CD44+ and CD24+ breast cancer cell populations (Park et al.,
2010a; Shipitsin et al., 2007). The neoplastic nature of the cells
was conﬁrmed by examining cellular and nuclear morphology
using adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and in
the majority of cases by the presence of chromosomal copy
number gain.

CD24+, and CD44

The 8q24 BAC and chromosome 8 (chr8) CEP signals were
counted in about 100 individual cells for each of the four pheno-
 
typically distinct tumor cell populations (i.e., CD44+CD24
,
CD44+CD24+, CD44
cells). Diversity
was evaluated based on Shannon and Simpson indices (Magur-
ran, 2004) that were calculated in four different ways based on
measures of (1) copy number of 8q24 (BAC probe), (2) copy
number of chr8 centromeric region (CEP), (3) ratio of BAC/CEP
counts, and (4) individual copy number of both BAC and CEP
probes in each cell (unique counts). Overall, each of the four
different calculations displayed similar
relative differences
among tumors and matched pre- and posttreatment samples,
but diversity indices were the highest based on unique counts
(Table S2). Thus, owing to its more accurate prediction of genetic
diversity, we subsequently used unique counts for all analyses
unless otherwise indicated.

First, we investigated whether pre- and posttreatment ge-
netic diversity for 8q24 is different in distinct breast tumor
subtypes. HER2+ tumors had signiﬁcantly higher diversity after
treatment compared to luminal B and TNBC tumors (Figure 1B;
Table S2). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
overall genetic diversity in any of the tumors between pre-
and posttreatment samples (Figure 1C). Next, we investigated
potential changes in genetic diversity in phenotypically distinct
tumor cell subpopulations. We required cell subpopulations for
analysis to represent at least 5% of all cancer cells within a
tumor in order to avoid a counting bias; thus, not all four pheno-
typic types were analyzed in all samples. In some tumors, we
observed signiﬁcant differences in the relative distribution of
copy number for BAC or CEP probes or BAC/CEP ratios in
speciﬁc cell subpopulations when comparing pre- and post-
treatment data (Figure S1A). We also observed changes in
cell populations and unique cancer cells based on kernel
density estimates and Whittaker plots (Figures S1B and S1C).
However, pairwise analysis of pre- and posttreatment
differences in genetic diversity in each of the four phenotypic
subpopulations across all tumors did not reveal signiﬁcant
changes (Figure 1D); cell-type-speciﬁc genetic diversity was
signiﬁcantly higher after treatment only in a few cases (Fig-
ure 1E; Table S2).

To ensure that our results were not due to the inaccurate
reﬂection of overall genomic diversity based on 8q24 counts,
we also analyzed three additional loci commonly ampliﬁed in
luminal (16p13), TNBC (10p13), and HER2+ (20q13) tumors.
Similar to 8q24, these additional loci also failed to demonstrate
signiﬁcant changes in genetic diversity (Figure 1F). Our data
suggest that genetic diversity is an intrinsic tumor trait that re-
mains relatively stable during treatment.

Changes in Phenotypic Heterogeneity Highlight Biologic
Differences among Cell Types
To determine potential changes in cellular phenotypes due to
treatment, we analyzed the relative frequency of the four distinct
cell subpopulations within tumors. We observed a signiﬁcant
CD24+ cells in luminal A,
increase in the frequency of CD44
luminal B, and TNBC tumors after treatment, and residual
cells (Figures
TNBC tumors were also enriched for CD44
2A and 2B). Concomitantly, there were fewer CD44+CD24
cells
in luminal A and triple-negative tumors after treatment, whereas
HER2+ tumors displayed very few changes in the distribution of
cell subpopulations. Next, we estimated the degree of pheno-
typic diversity based on the Shannon index and found that
phenotypic diversity for CD44 and CD24 markers tends to
decrease in luminal tumors, whereas it increases in TNBC tu-
mors (Figure S2).

and CD44

Because chemotherapy is thought to target proliferative cells
(Collecchi et al., 1998), the observed changes in the relative
frequencies of the four cell subpopulations could be due to
cell-type-speciﬁc differences in proliferation. Thus, we assessed
the frequency of cells positive for the Ki67 proliferation marker
within each of the four cell types before and after treatment.
The fraction of Ki67+ cells was lower in all cell types in all tumors
after treatment, with only a few exceptions (Figure S3A). We also
observed signiﬁcant differences in the proportion of Ki67+ cells
 
before treatment between CD44+CD24
CD24+ cell
populations, which were the most and least proliferative, respec-
tively (Figures 2C and 2D). Spearman correlation analysis of
associations between changes in the frequency of Ki67+ cells
and cell subpopulations revealed a signiﬁcant positive correla-
tion in CD44+CD24
cells (p = 0.007) and a signiﬁcant negative
CD24+ cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 2E). These
correlation in CD44
results imply that the increase in the relative frequency of
CD24+ compared to CD44+ cells after treatment might be due
to the preferential elimination of the more proliferative CD44+
cells by chemotherapy. Thus, if a tumor remains highly prolifera-

CD44
from CD44+ to CD24+ cellular phenotypes or a change in the

a direct effect of treatment cannot be excluded. These results
are in agreement with previous ﬁndings that treatment selects

et al., 2010) and in melanoma (Roesch et al., 2013).

Differences in cellular proliferation could also be related to
differences in genetic diversity because faster-growing cells
may have a larger population size and might therefore be more
likely to accumulate genetic abnormalities. Thus, we also
analyzed potential associations between the proliferation rate
of each cell type and its genetic diversity index. Spearman
correlation analysis demonstrated signiﬁcant associations be-

proliferation rates (Figure S3B). In contrast, after treatment,

0.04) correlation only in CD44+CD24
cells. We failed to observe

the fraction of Ki67+ cells during treatment (Figure S3C), sug-
gesting that although differences in proliferation could be asso-
ciated with differences in diversity in some cell subpopulations
before treatment, changes in proliferation were not generally
associated with differences in diversity after treatment.

Topology Maps to Explore Changes of Cellular
Heterogeneity in Spatially Explicit Context
The previous analyses focused on population-level genotypic
and phenotypic diversity. However, intermixing of tumor cells
is substantially restricted in solid tumors by tissue architecture.
Furthermore, heterogeneity of intratumor microenvironments,
including differences in extracellular matrix and vascularization,

is expected to impact selective pressures and differentiation
cues, thereby translating into differences in genotypes and
phenotypes. Therefore, we decided to address whether ac-
counting for spatially explicit tissue organization can reveal
therapy-induced changes in cellular heterogeneity missed by
population-based analyses. To investigate this issue, we created
tumor topology maps by analyzing the distribution of cancer
cells with distinct genotypes and phenotypes in three physically
distinct regions in 15 tumors (5 of each of the 3 major subtypes)
before and after treatment. These cases were selected based on
the presence of sufﬁciently large cell numbers after treatment to
allow cell-to-cell interaction analyses. For each cell, we recorded
copy numbers of 8q24 BAC and chr8 CEP probes and cellular
phenotype. Representative examples of such topology maps

are depicted in Figures 3A–3C (Patient 1, Luminal A tumor) and
S4 (patient 20, TNBC, and patient 30, HER2+ tumor). The tumor
of patient 1 showed a marked increase in both 8q24 BAC and
 
CD24+
chr8 CEP copy numbers and in the frequency of CD44
cells after treatment (Figures 3A–3C). In patient 20, there was a
clear decrease in both 8q24 BAC and chr8 CEP copy numbers,
but no substantial changes in the frequencies of cellular pheno-
types (Figures S4A–S4C). In contrast, in patient 30, there was a
dramatic increase in 8q24 BAC copy numbers with a concomi-
tant decrease in chr8 CEP counts but essentially no changes
in cellular phenotypes (Figures S4D–S4F). Therefore, at least
some tumors display substantial phenotypic and genotypic
differences pre- and posttreatment. Despite these changes,
pre- and posttreatment genetic diversity indices in the three
topologically distinct areas of each tumor were not signiﬁcantly
different (Table S3; Figure S5), with the exception of two cases
(patients 1 and 3, both with partial response to treatment). These
results imply that the analysis of even one region might be sufﬁ-
cient to assess overall genetic diversity of a tumor. However,
because the distant regions we compared were still within one
section and one biopsy, the possibility cannot be excluded

that biopsies taken from distant parts of the tumor may show
more pronounced differences. Furthermore, the lack of signiﬁ-
cant differences in genetic diversity in different regions of the
same tumor does not mean that tumor cells located in distinct
areas are genetically identical. It rather implies that diversity is
an inherent feature of the tumors that is less subjective to sam-
pling bias than the measurement of a speciﬁc trait.

Effect of Treatment on the Distribution of Genetic
Heterogeneity within Topology Maps
We then employed the topology maps to assess the effects of
treatment on spatial distribution of genetic heterogeneity by
measuring genetic distances between the adjacent and all
cancer cells within tumors using the copy number differences
for both 8q24 BAC and chr8 CEP. We observed that in most
cases, the distribution of the differences in copy number was
signiﬁcantly different after treatment compared to before treat-
ment, both when considering the differences only in adjacent
cells or in all cells (Figures 3D and 4A). However, in some cases,
the distribution of the differences in adjacent cells was not signif-
icantly different (Figure 4B), indicating the differential topologic

distribution of cells with similar copy number. We observed
that in several tumors, the genetic distance for both 8q24 BAC
and chr8 CEP probes changed in the same direction after
treatment, whereas in a few cases, the divergence for the 8q24
BAC probe decreased with a concomitant increase in variability
for chr8 CEP (Figures 3D and 4A–4C). Overall, in the 15 tumors
analyzed, the cell-to-cell variability for 8q24 BAC and chr8 CEP
counts was signiﬁcantly higher after treatment in eight cases,
lower for chr8 CEP copy number in ﬁve patients, and decreased
for 8q24 in three cases (Figure 4C). Therefore, incorporation of
spatially explicit context into analysis of genetic diversity has
revealed differences missed by population-wide analysis. How-
ever, the causes of the observed differences are difﬁcult to inter-
pret because increase in copy number differences between
adjacent cells after chemotherapy could be due to an increase
in genetic instability, the selection for slowly proliferating cells
that are more likely to be phylogenetically distinct, or increased
cell migration.

We then sought to obtain further insight by analyzing changes
in genetic divergence within cells with similar phenotype
focusing on the four phenotypically distinct cellular subpopula-
tions deﬁned by expression of CD24 and CD44. We found sig-
niﬁcant cell-type-speciﬁc differences in the degree of genetic
variability between all cells and all adjacent cells of the same
phenotype within individual tumors. For example, in a luminal
tumor (patient 1), the increase in cell-to-cell variability for 8q24

and chr8 CEP copy numbers was signiﬁcant in CD44
cells when considering all cells, whereas in

and CD44

The increased genetic variability in adjacent cells of the same
phenotype together with the signiﬁcant changes in the relative
frequency of distinct cell subpopulations due to treatment
suggests either selection for distinct phenotypes based on their
differential sensitivity to the treatment or increased rates of
genomic instability resulting from the treatment. Interestingly,
in all 15 tumors analyzed, the frequency of homotypic-pheno-
typic clustering was signiﬁcantly higher compared to the hetero-
typic one both before and after treatment (Figure 3F). Thus,
tumor cells tend to cluster more based on their phenotype than
on their genotype. The results of these topology analyses high-
light the insights afforded by analyzing tumors at the single-cell
level and in situ because the spatial organization of the cells
with distinct genotypes and phenotypes is lost when analyzing
bulk tissues or dissociated cells.

Computational Modeling Allows an Investigation of
Tumor Growth Patterns and Evolution during Treatment
To better understand the forces that could give rise to the
observed patterns of spatial clustering of cells with the same
phenotype, we next developed a stochastic computational
model of cellular proliferation and death utilizing our tumor topol-
ogy and Ki67 data (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for details). This model is based on a stochastic process of cell
growth and death in a 2D cross-section of a tumor, implemented
as a patient-speciﬁc computer simulation informed by para-
meters measured in a patient-speciﬁc manner. This model was
used to investigate the growth patterns and evolutionary dy-
namics of tumor cells during chemotherapy and also enabled
us to determine the extent to which proliferation alone could
explain the detected clustering of phenotypes.

The initialization state for the simulation for each patient con-
sisted of the cell coordinates for each cell in the pretreatment
samples, an estimation of the age of each cell based on its
size, and the cellular phenotypes. We considered the average
length of the cell cycle across all cellular phenotypes and all
patients to be comparable to the average cell-cycle time deter-
mined by cell line experiments (Schiffer et al., 1979), and then
varied individual cell-cycle times based on the corresponding
Ki67 values. Initially, we assumed that daughter cells maintained
the same phenotype as the mother cell, thus neglecting the
possibility of phenotypic switching or migration; this assumption
was later relaxed.

Each patient-speciﬁc simulation was performed for three
phases of proliferation. The ﬁrst phase consisted of the period
of time between biopsy and start of chemotherapy. Cell prolifer-
ation occurred at the rates determined by the pretreatment Ki67
data. The probability of cell death per unit time for each pheno-
type was selected to maintain a roughly constant population
size. We chose these values for cell death because rates of
apoptosis correlate well with proliferation, and the montage of
visualized cells did not consist of cells crowded together as
would be consistent with high growth rates. During treatment,
we lowered proliferation by 5% and adjusted the rate of cell
death accordingly. This choice of treatment effect was selected
by ﬁtting the number of cells at the end of the simulation to the
number of cells observed in the posttreatment samples, and
due to evidence of a decrease in proliferation with anthracyclines
with a corresponding decrease in apoptotic index (Burcombe
et al., 2006). The last phase consisted of the period of time
between the end of chemotherapy and surgery. Cell proliferation
in this phase occurred at the rates determined by the post-
treatment Ki67 data (Figure 6). These three time periods were
obtained individually for each patient and implemented in the
patient-speciﬁc simulations.

Using this model, we found that

the level of clustering
detected in our posttreatment samples was less than what
would be expected in a model without cellular motility or
phenotypic switching (Figure 6; Table S4; Movie S1). Therefore,
we sought to determine rates of phenotypic switching that
types found in our post-
would ﬁt
treatment samples. We identiﬁed a lower

phenotypic switching or motility among the luminal tumors,

imaging of meta-

in the rates of phenotypic switching necessary to recapitulate

The Impact of Intratumor Diversity on Therapeutic
Responses
To explore the potential impact of intratumor diversity on thera-
peutic resistance, we compared genetic and phenotypic diver-
sity among tumors classiﬁed as pCR and pathological partial
response (pPR) or stable disease. Interestingly, tumors with
pCR had the lowest pretreatment genetic diversity using mea-
sures that incorporated 8q24 copy number, whereas tumors
with partial response or stable disease were not signiﬁcantly
different from each other, neither before nor after treatment (Fig-
ures 7 and S6A; Table S5).

Age at diagnosis affects both breast tumor subtype and the
success of chemotherapy within a subtype (Hess et al., 2006).
TNBC is more common in younger women, and chemotherapy
also tends to be more effective in younger patients (Silver

et al., 2010). These epidemiological data suggest that tumors of
different subtypes may have different evolutionary paths and
growth kinetics such as the length of time from tumor initiation
to diagnosis, which may inﬂuence both treatment responses
and intratumor heterogeneity. Thus, we analyzed potential
associations between the age at diagnosis and the Shannon
diversity index of each tumor. We found that the extent of pre-
treatment diversity did not display a signiﬁcant correlation with
patient age (Figure S6B). However, older age at diagnosis was
signiﬁcantly correlated with a decrease in genetic diversity
during treatment in TNBC (p = 0.025) and an increase in genetic
diversity in HER2+ tumors (p = 0.038; Figure S6C). These results
suggest that TNBC in older women may have a dominant, slowly

It is possible that treatment-induced changes in genetic
diversity might be masked by rediversiﬁcation during the time
interval between the end of treatment and posttreatment sample
collection (i.e., surgery). Similarly, the duration of the treatment
(i.e., length of selective pressure) might affect intratumor genetic
diversity. Thus, we analyzed potential associations between
these clinical variables and changes in genetic diversity but did
not detect any signiﬁcant associations (Figures S6D and S6E).
These results suggest that the observed lack of changes in ge-

netic diversity during neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not likely to
be affected by the lengths of treatment and time between the
last dose of chemotherapy and the surgical removal of residual
tumors.

DISCUSSION

Here, we describe a single-cell-based analysis of intratumor
genetic and phenotypic diversity and topology in a cohort of
breast tumors prior to and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Although inter- and intratumor heterogeneity has been described
and well characterized in breast cancer (Cancer Genome Atlas
Network, 2012; Geyer et al., 2010; Hernandez et al., 2012;
Polyak, 2011; Stephens et al., 2012; Yap et al., 2012), our
knowledge of how intratumor heterogeneity may change during
therapeutic interventions in distinct subtypes of breast cancers
is very limited.
Neoadjuvant

(i.e., preoperative) chemotherapy is a well-
established standard treatment option for patients diagnosed
with locally advanced disease or patients with large potentially
operable tumors (Kaufmann et al., 2006).
In addition to its
effectiveness in reducing the size of the primary tumor, allow-
ing for
less-extensive surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy
also improves long-term clinical outcome, presumably by elim-
inating micrometastatic disease (Fisher et al., 1998). Moreover,

success of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The frequency of
CD44+ stem cell-like and CD24+ more-differentiated breast
cancer cells varies within tumors according to subtype, with
CD44+ cells being more common in TNBCs than in luminal
cancers (Honeth et al., 2008; Park et al., 2010b). The relative
frequency of these cells within tumors also changes during
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A study analyzing pre- and
posttreatment samples by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting

the neoplastic nature of
these cells was not conﬁrmed
(Li et al., 2008). Another report found that whereas an increased
frequency of CD44+CD24
cells after neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy was a poor prognostic factor, tumors that had a high
fraction of these cells were more likely to have a pCR (Lee
et al., 2011).

a pCR to neoadjuvant treatment is a strong predictor of long-
term disease-free survival (Esserman et al., 2012), particularly
in estrogen receptor
(ER)-negative cancers. Despite wide-
spread use of neoadjuvant therapies, our knowledge of their
inﬂuence on the subsequent evolution of the tumors is very
limited.

The success of chemotherapy is inﬂuenced by breast tumor
subtype, with luminal tumors in general being less responsive
than HER2+ and TNBC (Houssami et al., 2012). Because chemo-
therapy is thought to target proliferating cells, associations
between tumor proliferation (measured by the Ki67 index) and
treatment response have been extensively characterized, with
conﬂicting results. A recent study found that the relative change
in the fraction of Ki67+ cells, but not the absolute pre- and post-
treatment levels of Ki67+ cells, is an independent predictor of
treatment outcomes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in luminal
B, HER2+, and TBNC subtypes (Matsubara et al., 2013).
Changes in hormone receptors and HER2 due to neoadjuvant
therapy have also been analyzed with inconclusive results (van
de Ven et al., 2011).

More recently, intratumor heterogeneity for cellular pheno-
types, mainly focusing on stem cell-like and more differentiated
cell features, has been explored as a potential predictor of the

 

Here, we showed that whereas overall

intratumor cellular
genetic diversity for 8q24, 16p13, 10p13, and 20q does not
change during treatment in tumors with a partial or no response,
there are signiﬁcant changes in phenotypically distinct tumor cell
subpopulations within tumors and in the relative localization of
these populations of cells. Some of these changes might be
explained by the observed differences in the proliferation rates
among cell types, with CD44+CD24
cells being more prolifera-
tive and thus more likely to be eliminated. Our data, however,
also imply potential changes in cellular phenotypes and selection
for cells with more differentiated luminal features due to lower
sensitivity to the therapy stemming from lower proliferation
capacity. Moreover, our ﬁndings provide a potential explanation
for the apparent paradox between the presumed resistance of
CD44+ stem cell-like breast cancer cells (i.e., cancer stem cells)
(Dave et al., 2012) and our data demonstrating a relative
decrease in this cell population due to treatment. Based on
our data, CD44+CD24
cells are more proliferative than
CD24+ cells, and thus, they might be preferentially elimi-
CD44
nated by chemotherapy. If a tumor does not respond to treat-
ment due to inherent resistance, which is independent of stem
cell-like or epithelial phenotype, then there is an apparent in-
crease in the relative frequency of CD44+CD24
cells due to their
higher proliferation.

 

 

Our observation that in some cases adjacent cells within a
tumor are more likely to be genetically divergent yet phenotypi-
cally similar implies that homotypic cell-cell interactions might
favor treatment resistance and also that chemotherapy might in-
crease genetic instability or select for cells with higher chromo-
somal instability.

Our computational model of tumor cell proliferation provides a
tool with which we can predict changes in the distribution of cell
phenotypes in a patient-speciﬁc fashion. These variations can
manifest themselves in spatial coordinates and clustering of
cells, or they can be the result of changing population dynamics
over periods of time with and without therapy. Here, we found
that
the clustering of cellular phenotypes could not have
occurred solely due to cell division placing daughter cells closer
to the parent cell but must require some level of phenotypic plas-
ticity. We tested varying levels of phenotypic switching and
found that no single rate of switching could account for the diver-
gence between simulation and biopsy samples: instead, rates of
switch may vary at the subtype or individual patient level. We

also investigated the effects of migration on the predicted levels
of phenotypic switching and found that migration increases
the rate of phenotype switching necessary to explain the patient
data. This effect might arise because migration scatters
cells more widely throughout the tumor, and hence, phenotype
switching is needed to return the patterns of cells to those
observed in patient samples.

In summary, our data provide an integrated view of how the
genotype (measured by 8q24 copy number), phenotype (CD24
and CD44 expression and proliferation state), and topology
(distribution of cancer cells with deﬁned genotype and pheno-
type within tumors) change in response to neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy in breast cancer. Because phenotypic diversity in
combination with selection pressure by local microenviron-
mental signals is the driver of tumor evolution, our results high-
light the importance of using an integrated approach. Finally,
our in silico simulation of tumor growth using models built on
the patient-speciﬁc characterization of tumors at the single-cell
level in situ prior to and after chemotherapy illustrates the feasi-
bility of predicting the evolution of tumors during treatment—
knowledge that could be used for the design of more effective
treatment strategies.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

For further details, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

ImmunoFISH
The use and collection of the human tissue samples were performed following
protocols approved by the institutional review boards of the hospitals partici-
pating in this study. Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded breast tumor samples
were dewaxed in xylene and hydrated in a series of ethanol. Heat-induced
antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH 6), following by pepsin
digestion. The immunostaining for CD44 and CD24 was performed at room
temperature, followed by the hybridization with BAC and CEP probes and
incubation for 20 hr at 37
C. After several washes with different stringent
SCC buffers, the slides were air-dried and protected for long storage with
ProLong Gold. Different immunoﬂuorescence images from multiple areas of
each sample were acquired with a Nikon Ti microscope attached to a Yoko-
gawa spinning-disk confocal unit, 603 plan apo objective, and OrcaER cam-
era controlled by Andor iQ software.



Immunoﬂuorescence Analysis of Cellular Phenotypes and
Proliferation
Multicolor immunoﬂuorescence for CD44, CD24, and Ki67 was performed
using whole sections of formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded breast tumor sam-
ples by sequential staining after antigen retrieval
in citrate buffer (pH 6).
Different immunoﬂuorescence images were acquired as described before,
and the frequency of each cell phenotype was calculated by counting an
average of 300 cells in each sample.

Statistical Analyses
Genetic diversity was determined as described by Park et al.
(2010a).
Statistical differences in genetic diversity were analyzed by bootstrapping
and comparing the mean count of each bootstrap repetition against the
mean count of the smaller cell population. Correlations were assessed using
Spearman’s rank-based coefﬁcient. The association between diversity indices
and clinical variables was assessed using the Wilcoxon test for categorical
clinical variables (such as response) and a permutation test based on Spear-
man’s rank correlation for continuous clinical variables (such as size). Statisti-
cal differences in pre- and posttreatment BAC and CEP counts were evaluated
using the achieved signiﬁcance level (ASL) method of Efron and Tibshirani
(1993).
