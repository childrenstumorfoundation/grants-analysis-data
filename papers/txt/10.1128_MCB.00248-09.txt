Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 is an inherited autosomal disorder caused by biallelic inactivation of the NF2
tumor suppressor gene. The NF2 gene encodes a 70-kDa protein, merlin, which is a member of the ezrin-
radixin-moesin (ERM) family. ERM proteins are believed to be regulated by a transition between a closed
conformation, formed by binding of their N-terminal FERM domain and C-terminal tail domain (CTD), and
an open conformation, in which the two domains do not interact. Previous work suggests that the tumor
suppressor function of merlin is similarly regulated and that only the closed form is active. Therefore,
understanding the mechanisms that control its conformation is crucial. We have developed a series of probes
that measures merlin conformation by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer, both as puriﬁed protein and in
live cells. Using these tools, we ﬁnd that merlin exists predominately as a monomer in a stable, closed
conformation that is mediated by the central ␣-helical domain. The contribution from the FERM-CTD
interaction to the closed conformation appears to be less important. Upon phosphorylation or interaction with
an effector protein, merlin undergoes a subtle conformational change, suggesting a novel mechanism that
modulates the interaction between the FERM domain and the CTD.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 is an inherited autosomal disorder
that is characterized by bilateral schwannomas of the eighth
cranial nerve. The tumor suppressor gene responsible for this
disorder, NF2, was cloned in 1993 (45). Biallelic inactivation of
the NF2 gene is also seen in spontaneous schwannoma, me-
ningioma, and malignant mesothelioma (22). In mouse mod-
els, deletion of the Nf2 gene is embryonic lethal, indicating an
essential role for NF2 in development (24). Heterozygous mice
develop a variety of aggressive metastatic tumors that have lost
the wild-type allele (23). Targeted deletion of the Nf2 gene in
Schwann cells leads to schwannoma formation (7). In vitro,
Nf2-null cells grow to signiﬁcantly higher densities (31), sug-
gesting that contact inhibition of growth is impaired in these
cells and that mediation of growth arrest at high cell density
may be the basis for the tumor suppressor function of the NF2
gene. In normal ﬁbroblasts, merlin is inactive as a growth
suppressor in subconﬂuent cells, becoming activated as they
approach conﬂuence, thereby effecting contact inhibition of
growth (26).

The NF2 gene encodes a 70-kDa protein called merlin (for
moesin, ezrin, radixin-like protein), which shares signiﬁcant
homology with members of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)
branch of the Band 4.1 superfamily (45). The domain structure
of merlin, also shared with other ERM proteins, consists of an
N-terminal FERM domain, followed by a central ␣-helical

region (CH) and a C-terminal tail domain (CTD). The merlin
FERM domain has relatively high sequence similarity with
other ERM family members, a 60 to 70% identity over the ﬁrst
300 amino acids. The CH domain and the CTD show much
lower identity (28 to 36%); however, the ␣-helical character of
the CH domain is preserved, as is the heptad repeat pattern
typical of ␣-helices that form coiled coils (46).

The critical point of regulation of all the ERM proteins is a
high-afﬁnity intramolecular interaction between the C-termi-
nal domain and the FERM domain (4) (Fig. 1). The FERM
domain folds into a three-lobed cloverleaf structure that acts as
a multifaceted docking site for protein binding partners (16,
39). The CTD, consisting of four major and two minor helices
and a beta sheet, binds to the FERM domain by extending
across the face of the F2 and F3 lobes (32). This intramolecular
head-to-tail binding results in a “closed” conformation, with
the C-terminal domain covering much of the surface of the
FERM domain (32, 44). For ezrin, radixin and moesin, the
CTD functions as a mask, blocking access of effector mole-
cules, such as the cell surface receptors CD44 and ICAM2 and
adaptor molecules, like EBP50/NHERF, to sites on the surface
of the FERM domain (11, 25, 44). The interaction between the
CTD and FERM domain is regulated by phosphatidyl inositol-
(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding to the FERM domain and
by phosphorylation of a critical residue in the CTD (3, 6, 10,
49). This residue, threonine 567 in ezrin, is conserved through-
out the ERM family (21). Phosphorylation introduces a nega-
tive charge and a bulky side group that effectively reduces the
afﬁnity of the interaction, releasing the CTD from the FERM
domain and causing a transition to an open conformation.
Low-angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy (13) and bio-
chemical studies (12) of puriﬁed radixin suggest that in the
open conformation it is an extended ﬁlamentous structure with

FIG. 1. ERM tertiary structure as represented by the crystal structure of full-length Sf-moesin (20), but with the merlin amino acid sequence
substituted for Sf-moesin. Approximate boundary amino acid residues for all domains appear at the top of the ﬁgure. Each domain is assigned a
different color. The ERM structure consists of an N-terminal FERM domain folded into three lobes, F1, F2, and F3. This is followed by a central
␣-helical domain containing three subhelices (␣A, ␣B, and ␣C) and a CTD with four short helices. An ERM protein is thought to have an open
conformation, an extended structure with the FERM domain and the CTD separated by the ␣-helical domain, that is more than 240 Å long. In
the closed conformation, the ␣-helical domain bends at the ␣A-␣B junction and again at the ␣B-␣C junction, causing the CTD to be positioned
over F2 and F3 of the FERM domain. More than half of the surface of the FERM domain is masked by interaction with the CTD, ␣A, and parts
of ␣B and ␣C.

globular N and C termini that is greater than 240 Å in length.
Signal transduction systems, such as the epidermal growth fac-
tor and Rho A pathways, induce phosphorylation of ERM
proteins at the conserved C-terminal threonine via a number of
kinases, including Rho kinase and protein kinase C␣ (21, 28).
Thus, conformational regulation of ERM proteins can be a
point of integration of ERM activity with signal transduction
pathways. The overall concept of ERM regulation, then, is
centered upon a transition between an inactive, closed confor-
mation that is mediated by the FERM-CTD interaction and an
active, open conformation that is regulated by phosphoryla-
tion. In these two states, ERM proteins likely interact with
different sets of binding partners, resulting in distinct func-
tional outcomes.

Like the classical ERMs, merlin is also thought to be regu-
lated by changes in conformation. The FERM domain and the
CTD of merlin interact with each other, albeit at a lower level
of afﬁnity than the ezrin FERM domain and the CTD (29).
There are important differences, however, between merlin and
the other ERM proteins. First, phosphorylation of the con-
served C-tail threonine T576 has not been reported to occur in
mammalian merlin, and nonphosphorylatable and phosphomi-
metic substitutions at this site have no effect on merlin activity
(42). Instead, merlin is phosphorylated at serine 518 in the
CTD, a target of the p21-activated kinase PAK and protein
kinase A (1, 18, 47). The growth-suppressive function of merlin
is activated by dephosphorylation of S518 by the phosphatase
PP1␦ in a density-dependent manner (14). Second, it was re-
ported in a study using FERM domain and CTD truncates of
merlin that only cotransfection of both the N-and C-terminal
halves resulted in growth suppression (38). Together, these

observations suggested a model of inactive, phosphorylated
merlin in an open conformation that, upon cell-to-cell contact,
is dephosphorylated and transitions to a closed, growth sup-
pressive conformation.

The existing model for conformational regulation described
above is inferred from indirect data and assays that generally
measure the interaction of isolated FERM and CTD truncates
rather than full-length molecules (9, 29, 38). It has been im-
possible to test directly because tools have not been available
to speciﬁcally assay for either the open or the closed form of
merlin. Therefore, we have developed a series of probes that
measures merlin conformation by ﬂuorescence resonance en-
ergy transfer (FRET), both as puriﬁed protein and in live cells.
Using these tools, we show that merlin exists predominately as
a monomer in a stable, largely closed conformation. Addition-
ally, we ﬁnd that the closed conformation is largely mediated
by the central ␣-helical domain;
the contribution of the
FERM-CTD interaction appears to be less signiﬁcant than
previously thought. Finally, we ﬁnd that phosphorylation and
protein interaction cause unexpectedly small changes in merlin
conformation. We propose a new and more reﬁned model for
merlin regulation, in which merlin function is regulated by
speciﬁc but subtle conformational changes that modulate the
interaction between the FERM domain and the CTD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture. SC4 Nf2⫺/⫺ Schwann cells were obtained from Marco Giovannini
(House Ear Institute) and Helen Morrison (Leibniz Institute for Age Research).

gle’s medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and pen-
icillin streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C, 10% CO2, and 95% humidity. Cells

were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Molecular biology. The merlin FRET probes were constructed from three
founder plasmids, pCerulean-1 (David Piston, Vanderbilt University), pCMV-
Venus (Dan Felsenfeld, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine), and pCMV-ﬂag Merlin
I. Cerulean is a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) mutant with a blue-shifted
emission spectrum that will act as a donor to Venus, a GFP mutant with a
yellow-shifted emission spectrum (27, 34). DNA fragments were isolated from
agarose gel and puriﬁed with a gel puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen). Mini and maxi
plasmid preparations were also performed with standard kits (Qiagen and Roche
Applied Science). To generate the pC6V FRET control, Venus was cut from
pCMV-Venus with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pCerulean-C1, which had
been cut with BglII and EcoRI and dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline
phosphatase (SAP; Promega). To generate a second FRET control, pC23V the
BamHI-EcoRI Venus fragment was cloned into BamHI-EcoRI-cut pCerulean-
C1. To generate a vector that would easily accept merlin in frame to Cerulean
and Venus, we generated an intermediate vector by placing a phosphorylated
duplex adaptor oligonucleotide containing restriction sites for BspEI and SacI
and overhanging cohesive ends for BspEI and BamHI. The sense strand is
5⬘-CCGGTCCGGACAGTGAGCTCG-3⬘. The antisense strand is 5⬘-GATCCG
AGCTCACTGTCCGGA-3⬘. This adapter was cloned into BspEI-BamHI-cut
pC23V. The resulting plasmid, designated pC-Ada-V, was found to have multiple
copies of the adaptor primer, but the 5⬘ cloning BspEI site and the 3⬘ SacI site
were in the correct frame relative to Cerulean and Venus to generate a fusion
protein with a 35-amino-acid linker and to accept merlin. To generate pC-
Mer-V, we cut merlin from pCMV-Flag-Merlin I with XmaI and SacI. XmaI and
BspEI have compatible cohesive ends, and the SacI site in merlin straddles the
penultimate amino acids. This fragment was cloned into the BspEI and SacI sites
of SAP-treated pC-Ada-V to make pC-Mer-V. To clone C-Mer, the XbaI-EcoRI
fragment from pCMV-ﬂag-Merlin I, containing the merlin stop codon, was
cloned into the BspEI and EcoRI sites of SAP-treated pC-Ada-V. To make
pMer-V, the XmaI-SacI fragment of pCMV-ﬂag Merlin I was cloned into
pC-Ada-V, which had been cut with AgeI-SacI and treated with SAP. AgeI cuts
pC-Ada-V upstream of Cerulean and generates compatible cohesive ends with
BspEI, resulting in a fusion protein that initiates with the merlin start codon.

We generated deletions of the major domains by amplifying speciﬁc fragments
of merlin, using pCMV-ﬂag Merlin I as a template. The upstream PCR primers
were designed with terminal XmaI and the downstream primers with a SacI
site to ﬁt into the BspEI and SacI sites of the pC-Ada-V vector. The FERM-
Helix protein, from amino acid 1 to amino acid 502, was ampliﬁed using the
upstream primer 5⬘-TGTCCCGGGAATGGCCGGAGCCATCGCTTCT-3⬘
and the downstream primer 5⬘-TGTGAGCTCACCAATGAGGTTGAAGC
TTGG-3⬘. The Helix-CTD PCR product encompassing amino acids 315 to
595 was ampliﬁed using the upstream primer 5⬘-TGTGCTAGCATGTCTTT
GGAAGTTCAGCAGATG-3⬘ and the downstream primer 5⬘-AAG TGG
CAG GTC CTG GGG-3⬘. The Helix PCR product encompassing amino acids
315 to 502 was ampliﬁed using the upstream primer 5⬘-TGTCCCGGGATC
TTTGGAAGTTCAGCAGTG-3⬘ and the downstream primer 5⬘-TGTGAG
CTCACCAATGAGGTTGAAGCTTGG-3⬘. The FERM fragment
from
amino acid 1 to amino acid 314 was ampliﬁed using the upstream primer
5⬘-TGTCCCGGGAATGGCCGGAGCCATCGCTTCT-3⬘ and the down-
stream primer 5⬘-TGTGAGCTCATCGGCTTTCCTTCTCCTCAT-3⬘. PCR
products were puriﬁed from an agarose gel, digested with XmaI and SacI, and
then repuriﬁed from an agarose gel and ligated into BspE I-SacI cut, SAP-
treated pC-Ada-V. All plasmids derived from PCR were fully sequenced on
both strands to rule out PCR-induced mutation.

For bacterial expression and puriﬁcation, we chose to ﬁrst place a C-
terminal epitope tag in Venus to facilitate future puriﬁcation of full-length
merlin. We generated a duplex adapter molecule that encoded an 8-amino-
acid Strep tag, WSHPQFEK (52), followed by a stop codon, designed to be
inserted in frame into the BsrGI site at the 3⬘ end of the Venus gene and the
NotI site in the multiple-cloning site of pCMV-Venus. The sequences of this
adapter are 5⬘-GTACAAGTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAATAACG
GCC-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-GGCCTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAC
TT-3⬘ (antisense). The resulting plasmid is designated pCMV-VenusST. To
move the Strep tag into pC-Mer-V, Venus was excised with BamHI and NotI
and replaced with the compatible BamHI-EagI fragment
from pCMV-
VenusST to create pC-Mer-Vst. The C-Mer-Vst cassette was then excised
with EcoRV and EagI and cloned into the EcoRV-NotI site of pET-30b(⫹).
This plasmid, pET-C-Mer-Vst, expressed a protein with a His6 tag N-terminal
to Cerulean and the Strep tag C-terminal to Venus. The remaining bacterial
expression clones, C6V, C-FERM-V, C-FERM-Helix-V, C-Helix-CTD-V,
and C-Helix-V, were cloned by cutting with Eco47III and BsrGI and ligating

into pET-C-Mer-Vst cut with EcoRV and BsrGI and treated with SAP.
Unless otherwise noted, all biochemicals were purchased from Sigma and all
restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Custom oligonucleo-
tides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.

Protein puriﬁcation. For puriﬁcation, pET-30b(⫹)-based plasmids (Novagen)
were transformed into the Rosetta2(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Novagen),
which is supplemented with tRNAs to match mammalian codon usage. Over-
night cultures from a single colony were inoculated 1:20 in 500 ml of LB sup-
plemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown at
37°C with shaking at 200 rpm until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8 to 1.2 was
achieved and then cooled in an ice bath for 30 min. The culture was diluted 1:2
by adding 500 ml ice-cold LB containing 0.2 mM IPTG (isopropyl-␤-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside) and 20 ml ethanol for ﬁnal concentrations of 0.1 mM IPTG and
2% ethanol. To maximize expression of soluble protein, the culture was then
incubated overnight at room temperature with shaking at 200 rpm. The cells
were pelleted at 3,500 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellets were then weighed and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. To harvest merlin protein, the pellets were thawed
and resuspended in 5 ml per gram of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM
NaCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol,
1:100 His6 protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma], 10 ␮g/ml DNase I, 100 ␮g/ml
RNase I, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated at 4°C with agitation for 30 min. The
lysate was then sonicated on ice for six cycles of 10 s on and 10 s off. Cell debris
was pelleted at 14,000 ⫻ g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was saved.

Recombinant protein was recovered from lysate by dual afﬁnity chromatogra-
phy. Lysate was run over a nickel agarose column (Talon; Clontech); washed with
50 mM NaHa2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole; and then eluted in
50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol, 250 mM
imidazole. Eluted fractions were pooled and run over a streptactin column (IBA
Biotagnology), washed with TBS (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
␤-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with TBS-2.5 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma). Eluted
fractions were pooled and analyzed for purity by Western blotting (see Fig. 4)
and their protein concentrations determined by absorbance at 280 nm.

FRET spectroﬂuorometry. Spectroﬂuorometry was performed using a Horiba
Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectroﬂuorometer. Puriﬁed proteins were analyzed at
a concentration of 1 ␮M in TBS at room temperature. Samples were excited at
435 nm with a 5-nm slit width, and emission spectra were acquired from 450 nm
to 600 nm at 1-nm intervals with a 2-nm slit width. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
was then added to each sample to give a 0.1% ﬁnal concentration, and the
emission spectra were measured again. SDS denatures the merlin structure
without affecting the Cerulean or Venus ﬂuorescence (2, 15), thus providing an
internal negative control in each sample control for non-FRET-derived ﬂuores-
cence. Transfected cell lysates were analyzed the same way, except using 5-nm slit
widths at emission and excitation for enhanced sensitivity. The FRET signal (F)
is expressed as a ratio of the acceptor emission (from 515 to 550 nm [Em515-550])
to the donor emission (from 460 nm to 490 nm [Em460-490]) with excitation at the
donor’s peak excitation wavelength of 435 nm (Ex435): F ⫽ Ex435 Em515-550/Ex435
Em460-490. FRET efﬁciency (EFRET) is expressed as normalized to the level for
the SDS-denatured negative control: EFRET ⫽ 1 ⫺ (FSDS/FFRET).

Analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were car-
ried out at 20°C with a Beckman XL-I ProteomeLab analytical ultracentrifuge
using absorbance optics. C-Mer-V and C-Helix-V proteins in 100 mM Tris, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM desthiobiotin, and 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol were
loaded into two-sector charcoal-ﬁlled Epon centerpieces, spun at 36,000 rpm,
and scanned at 280 nm. Data were analyzed using c(s) and c(M) models in the
program Sedﬁt (36) to determine differential sedimentation coefﬁcient (S) and
apparent mass distributions, respectively.

Microscopy. SC4 cells were plated in 35-mm coverslip bottom dishes (Matek)
and transfected as described above. After 24 h, cells were rinsed and the medium
was replaced with phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium contain-
ing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Cells were imaged live with a Zeiss Axioplan
microscope using a 63⫻ 1.4-numerical-aperture PlanApo water immersion ob-
jective, a Hammamatsu Orca ER camera, and a Uniblitz shutter controlled by
Metamorph imaging software. The ﬁlter sets used for FRET were from Chroma.
The excitation ﬁlter/dichroic mirror/emission ﬁlter sets for Cerulean were D436/
20x, 455DCLP, and D480/40m; those for Venus were HQ515/20, Q515LP, and
HQ535/30m; and those for FRET were D436/20x, 455DCLP, and HQ535/30m.
The exposure times for donor, acceptor, and FRET channels were always held
constant. Each ﬁeld yielded three 1,280- by 1,024-pixel, 12-bit images, represent-
ing the donor, acceptor, and FRET channels. Ten ﬁelds were acquired for each
transfection.

Image analysis. Images were analyzed using the Image J package (NIH). For
the FRET/donor ratio images, the background was subtracted using a rolling-ball
algorithm with a 50-pixel radius. A mask was then created by thresholding the

donor image and setting the background pixels to a value of 0 and the cell body
pixels to a value of 1. The ratio image was generated by dividing the value for the
background-subtracted FRET channel image by that for the background-sub-
tracted donor channel image and multiplying the result by the value for the mask.
The resulting 32-bit ﬂoating point image was used to measure the average pixel
intensity in order to calculate FRET efﬁciencies. For display, 32-bit ﬂoating point
images were converted to 8-bit images and then pseudocolored for intensity by
using the Image J lookup table called Fire. The positive FRET control, C6V, and
the negative FRET control, C-Mer, were used to set the upper and lower
threshold scales for all ratio images. For display, the donor, acceptor, and FRET
channel images were background subtracted as described above, converted into
8-bit images, and then pseudocolored using the cyan, yellow, and red lookup
tables in Image J.

GST pulldowns. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)–NHERF was purchased
from Addgene (plasmid 11636) (8). Expression in E. coli BL-21 was induced with
IPTG. After lysis, GST or GST-NHERF was bound to glutathione beads and the
beads were washed extensively. The amount of protein bound to the beads was
determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). To assay for binding, an excess of
GST or GST-NHERF beads was mixed with puriﬁed FRET probes and incu-
bated at room temperature for 60 min with agitation in the dark. The beads were
then transferred to disposable spin columns (Pierce) and centrifuged for 30 s at
3,000 ⫻ g, and the ﬂowthrough was collected. The beads were washed four times
with 500 ␮l TBS. GST proteins were eluted in four successive fractions with 100
mM glutathione in TBS, pH 7.5. For quantiﬁcation, the ﬂuorescence levels of
aliquots of the input, ﬂowthrough, wash, and eluate fractions were measured with
a SpectraMax Gemini XPS plate ﬂuorometer (Molecular Probes). The percent
bound was calculated as the ﬂuorescence in the pooled eluate fractions relative
to the total ﬂuorescence. The emission spectrum of the pooled eluate was
measured as described above.

RESULTS

Merlin FRET probes. In crystal structures, the distance be-
tween the N- and C-terminal residues of ERM proteins in the
closed conformation is 54 Å (Fig. 1) (20). When the molecule
is in the open conformation, the length of merlin is predicted
to be approximately 240 Å, suggesting that the open and closed
conformations of merlin would be readily distinguishable by
FRET, a sensitive technique that detects molecular interac-
tions in the 10- to 100-Å range (40). To demonstrate this
experimentally, we fused two GFP spectral variants, Cerulean
and Venus, fused in frame to the N and C termini of merlin, to
produce a FRET probe for merlin conformation, designated
C-Mer-V (Fig. 2A). Additionally, to rule out the possibility of
FRET signal emanating from antiparallel merlin dimers rather
than from intramolecular FERM-CTD interaction, we con-
structed two more merlin fusion proteins: C-Mer, consisting of
Cerulean fused in frame to the merlin N terminus, and Mer-V,
consisting of Venus fused in frame to the merlin C terminus
(Fig. 2A). We also constructed a positive control for FRET,
C6V, consisting of Cerulean and Venus separated by a 6-amino-
acid linker. Constructs were transfected into an immortalized
Schwann cell line, SC4, derived from the conditional NF2⫺/⫺
knockout mouse (7). Western blot analysis of transfected SC4
cell lysates showed that these constructs expressed stable fu-
sion proteins of the appropriate size that react with both anti-
merlin and anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2B).

C-Mer-V is biologically active. To determine if the addition
of GFP variants to the N- and C-terminal ends of merlin
interferes with function, we compared the abilities of the
FRET probes to inhibit signal transduction cascades to un-
tagged merlin, as measured by a transient AP-1 reporter assay
(17). Cotransfection of C-Mer-V with an AP-1 reporter con-
struct (⫺73 Col-Luc) signiﬁcantly inhibited AP-1 activity rela-
tive to the level for a control transfection (Fig. 2C). Similarly,

the single-fusion proteins C-Mer and Mer-V also signiﬁcantly
inhibited AP-1 activity (Fig. 2C). This effect was on par with
inhibition by untagged merlin and a dominant-negative AP-1
control construct, GFP-A-fos (GaF) (Fig. 2C), and suggests
that the fusion of ﬂuorescent proteins to either end of C-
Mer-V does not destroy the merlin function. To assess the
effect of C-Mer-V on growth, we performed a ﬂow cytometry-
based clonogenic assay on SC4 cells. The outgrowth of C-Mer-
V-positive G418-resistant cells was reduced compared to the
level for a C6V control (Fig. 2D), indicating that growth inhi-
bition was not affected by the fusion of Cerulean and Venus to
either terminus of merlin. These experiments argue against any
dramatic abrogation of merlin function in the FRET probes;
however, subtle differences in merlin activity caused by the
presence of the N- and C-terminal GFP molecules cannot be
ruled out.

Merlin FRET derives from monomers. To further validate
the FRET probes as tools for measurement of merlin confor-
mation, we performed spectroﬂuorometry on cell lysates de-
rived from transfected SC4 cells. Western blot analysis of the
lysates veriﬁed that C-Mer and Mer-V were expressed to
equimolar levels (Fig. 3A). FRET is measured as the ﬂuores-
cence intensity at the acceptor’s peak emission wavelength
(515 nm to 550 nm) relative to the intensity at the donor peak
emission wavelength (460 nm to 490 nm) with excitation at the
donor’s peak excitation wavelength (435 nm). As a positive
FRET control, SC4 cells were transfected with the C6V plas-
mid, and cells transfected with Cerulean alone were used as a
reference spectrum. Lysate from untransfected cells was used
to subtract signal resulting from possible autoﬂuorescence in
the cell lysates. As a negative control for FRET, we treated the
cell lysates with 0.1% SDS, which denatures merlin but does
not affect the ﬂuorescent proteins to which it is fused (2, 15)
(Fig. 3C). This treatment provided a negative control that has
the same molar ratio of Cerulean to Venus as the untreated
fusion protein. The emission spectrum of C-Mer-V-transfected
cell lysates had a clear FRET signal in the 515- to 550-nm
range. SDS treatment resulted in a complete loss of FRET
signal, indicating that the FRET required properly folded mer-
lin (Fig. 3B). The detection of a measurable FRET signal in
transfected mammalian cell lysate suggests a population of
C-Mer-V that exists in a closed conformation. In contrast, the
emission spectrum of the cell lysate derived from the C-Mer/
Mer-V cotransfection had no FRET signal, and addition of
SDS did not change the spectrum (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the
FRET detected with C-Mer-V is due to interaction between
Cerulean and Venus within the same molecule. This experi-
ment demonstrates the feasibility of the FRET strategy and
suggests that merlin exists as a monomer in a closed confor-
mation.

scans for C-Mer/Mer-V in the presence and absence of SDS are es-
sentially superimposable and therefore difﬁcult to discern. (C) Emis-
sion spectra showing that ﬂuorescence of Cerulean and Venus is not
affected by the addition of 0.1% SDS. Lysates from Cerulean-trans-
fected and Cerulean-Venus-cotransfected cells were excited at 435 nm.
Lysate from Venus-transfected cells was excited at 490 nm.

FIG. 3. Merlin FRET in cell lysates. (A) Immunoblot analysis of
SC4 cells transfected with Cerulean (lane 1), C6V (lane 2), C-Mer-V
(lane 3), and C-Mer and Mer-V (lane 4). The doublets of both West-
ern blots in lane 4 (arrows) indicate equal expression of C-Mer and
Mer-V. The lower blot for C-Mer-V shows signiﬁcant low-molecular-
mass contaminants that were recognized by the anti-GFP antibody,
suggesting proteolysis. The presence of these contaminants, which
could lead to overestimation of FRET, prompted us to use dual tag
afﬁnity puriﬁed bacterially expressed proteins for further studies. Mo-
lecular mass markers in kDa are on the left. (B) Emission spectra of
lysates from transfected SC4 cells, excited at 435 nm and measured at
room temperature. For this and all subsequent ﬁgures, all raw ﬂuo-
rescence values are normalized to the maximum value obtained in a
given scan such that all plotted values are ⱕ1. This allows all spectra
in a given experiment to be presented in a single graph, regardless of
the differences in the expression levels of the constructs used. The
ﬂuorescence of C-Mer-V between 515 nm and 550 nm is FRET that
arises due to the proximity of the two ﬂuorophores. FRET does not
occur in a cotransfection of C-Mer and Mer-V, ruling out dimerization
as the cause of FRET. Addition of 0.1% SDS to C-Mer-V abolishes
the FRET, indicating that FRET requires properly folded merlin. The

FIG. 4. Puriﬁcation of C-Mer-V from bacterial cell lysates. Results are shown for immunoblot analysis of aliquots sampled during puriﬁcation
of C-Mer-V from bacterial cell lysates, probed with antibodies to merlin (left) and GFP (right). Ni FT, nickel column ﬂowthrough; Ni eluate, eluate
from the nickel column; streptactin FT, streptactin column ﬂowthrough; streptactin eluate, eluate from the streptactin column.

Ablation of the FERM-CTD interaction is insufﬁcient to
generate the open conformation. The preliminary experiments
using transfected cell lysates serve as a proof of principle for
the FRET study. To make more-accurate measurements under
better-deﬁned conditions, we puriﬁed merlin FRET fusion
proteins from a bacterial expression system by using a dual
afﬁnity tag protocol (Fig. 4). The use of tags at both ends of
merlin ensured that the expressed product was full-length and
that the two ﬂuorophores, Cerulean and Venus, would be
present at equimolar amounts during FRET measurement.
Additionally, to identify the merlin sequences responsible for
this closed conformation, we constructed variants of C-Mer-V
with deletions in its major domains (Fig. 5A). We constructed
a deletion mutant of the CTD, C-FERM-Helix-V, that is un-
able to engage in the FERM-CTD interaction. According to
current views, this variant would be predicted to exist in a
constitutively open conformation. The converse construct, C-
Helix-CTD-V, lacks the FERM domain and would also be
expected to be in a constitutively open conformation. An ad-
ditional construct, C-Helix-V, consisted of the central helix
region alone, devoid of both the FERM domain and the CTD.
Finally, the C-FERM-V construct contains the FERM domain
alone. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and infrared
protein staining demonstrate that full-length C-Mer-V and
mutant proteins were puriﬁed to near-homogeneity from the
bacterial expression system (Fig. 5B).

The FRET efﬁciency of puriﬁed, full-length C-Mer-V was
measured at a concentration of 1 ␮M, in 150 mM NaCl, pH
7.5, at room temperature. As was done with cell lysates, sam-
ples were treated with 0.1% SDS to denature merlin and to
establish a baseline emission spectrum from which we calcu-
lated the FRET efﬁciency. Measurements using trypsin-di-
gested C-Mer-V as the negative baseline produced essentially
identical FRET efﬁciencies (data not shown). Additionally, the
FRET measurements were performed with 2.5 M NaCl to
further rule out FRET resulting from dimerization, since pu-
riﬁed preparations of merlin exist primarily as monomers at
high salt concentrations (29).

Under these conditions, puriﬁed C-Mer-V had a FRET ef-
ﬁciency of 0.311, consistent with measurements obtained from
mammalian cell lysates (Fig. 5B). Although the distance be-
tween the two ﬂuorophores could not be calculated exactly,
because of the lack of information on ␬2, the angle between the
ﬂuorophore dipoles within C-Mer-V (33), this FRET efﬁciency
indicates that C-Mer-V is not in an open conformation in
which the merlin moiety is in an unfurled conﬁguration ⬃240
Å in length but exists in a folded conformation similar to that
described to occur in the moesin crystal structure (20). FRET
from C-Mer-V was completely abolished in 0.1% SDS, indi-
cating that merlin secondary structure is required for effective
FRET (Fig. 5C). The FRET efﬁciency of C-Mer-V was dra-
matically increased in 2.5 M NaCl (Fig. 5C), suggesting that
merlin conformation is sensitive to local ionic conditions and
ruling out dimerization as a source of the FRET signal. In
contrast, the FRET signal from C6V was only minimally af-
fected by high salt concentration and reduced in 0.1% SDS
(Fig. 5H), most likely due to a relaxation of the unstructured
amino acids linking Cerulean and Venus in this protein.

Of considerable surprise, the FRET efﬁciency of C-FERM-
Helix-V, which lacked the CTD, was also high, at 0.303 (Fig. 5D),
and showed an additional increase in 2.5 M NaCl. These values
are very similar to those obtained from full-length C-Mer-V and
strongly suggest that even in the absence of a FERM-CTD inter-
action merlin nevertheless exhibits FRET, most probably because
it exists in a closed conformation. This notion is further supported
by results from the FERM deletion mutant C-Helix-CTD-V,
which also had a FRET efﬁciency of 0.343 and a hypertonic
contraction (Fig. 5E). Likewise, the helix domain alone, encoded
by the C-Helix-V construct, had a FRET efﬁciency of 0.346 and
contracted under hypertonic conditions (Fig. 5F). On the basis of
our ﬁnding that mutants lacking the FERM domain, the CTD, or
both all had signiﬁcant levels of intramolecular FRET, we con-
clude that ablating the FERM-CTD interaction is insufﬁcient to
force merlin into a constitutively open conformation but that the
central ␣-helical domain alone is sufﬁcient to cause merlin to
assume the closed conformation.

with an analytical ultracentrifuge to directly measure the
shapes, sizes, and hydrodynamic parameters of the C-Mer-V
and C-Helix-V proteins. Our data indicate that C-Mer-V sed-
iments predominantly as a single population of monomers,
with an S value of 5.3 ⫾ 0.65 and an apparent molecular mass
of ⬃123 kDa (Fig. 6A), in close agreement with its calculated
molecular mass of 130 kDa. The frictional coefﬁcient (f/f0) is
1.693, consistent with an elongated molecule with a prolate
axial ratio of 9.35. C-Helix-V also sedimented as a monomer,
with an S value of 4.5 ⫾ 0.80 and an apparent molecular mass
of ⬃95.4 kDa (Fig. 6B). This is again in close agreement with
the predicted molecular mass of 96.6 kDa. The f/f0 value for
C-Helix-V is 1.679, also consistent with an elongated molecule
with a prolate axial ratio of 9.15. The analytical ultracentrifu-
gation experiments were carried out under the same conditions
as those used to measure FRET, and their results unambigu-
ously rule out the contribution of dimeric or multimeric com-
plexes to FRET in the puriﬁed C-Mer-V and C-Helix-V prep-
arations. Just as important, the similar prolate axial ratios of
C-Mer-V and C-Helix-V again support the notion that the
closed conformation of the central ␣-helix is maintained in the
absence of the two end domains.

Merlin conformation in live cells. Results from cotransfec-
tion of C-Mer and Mer-V, FRET signal in the deletion mu-
tants, and the analytical ultracentrifuigation experiments dem-
onstrate that merlin exists primarily as a folded monomer in
vitro. We sought to test this in vivo, in the context of living
cells, by performing FRET imaging on SC4 Schwann cells that
expressed our merlin constructs. Live, unﬁxed cells expressing
each of the merlin deletion mutants were imaged using ﬁlter
sets for the donor, acceptor, and FRET channels. The ratio of the
emission in FRET channel to that in the donor channel, the
FRET/donor ratio, is an indication of the level of FRET, and to
display the FRET signals optimally, we generated pseudocolor
images based on this ratio. In cells transfected with the C6V
positive-control plasmid, the FRET/donor ratio was high, con-
ﬁrming a high level of FRET. In contrast, a negative control
consisting of cells expressing C-Mer showed a low FRET/donor
ratio. We used these two FRET/donor ratios to set the upper and
lower thresholds of the pseudocolor display.

In transfected SC4 cells, C-Mer-V was localized to the cell
periphery and dynamic actin structures (Fig. 7), as expected
(48). The ratio image shows a clearly detectable level of FRET.
The ratio images are also homogeneous, supporting our in
vitro experiments showing that the merlin population exists as
a single conformation. The C-FERM-Helix-V protein, which
lacked the CTD, also displayed a marked localization to the
cell periphery, identical to that seen with full-length C-Mer-V
(Fig. 7). The FRET/donor ratio of C-FERM-Helix-V was sim-
ilar to that of the full-length protein and in line with the FRET
efﬁciency measured by spectroﬂuorometry. The FERM dele-
tion mutant C-Helix-CTD-V had a strikingly different distri-

FIG. 6. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies of puriﬁed C-Mer-V
and C-Helix-V. (A) The S distribution of C-Mer-V, as measured by
absorbance at 280 nm, yielded an S value of 5.3 ⫾ 0.65, with an
apparent molecular mass of ⬃123 kDa and an f/f0 value of 1.693.
(B) The S distribution of C-Helix-V yielded an S value of 4.5 ⫾ 0.80,
with an apparent molecular mass of ⬃95.4 kDa and an f/f0 value of
1.679.

Interestingly, the C-FERM-V construct, which encodes only
the FERM domain, displayed a very strong FRET signal, with
an efﬁciency of 0.595 (Fig. 5G). Treatment with 0.1% SDS
completely abolished its FRET signal, while 2.5 M NaCl
slightly increased the FRET efﬁciency, possibly resulting from
contraction of the domain.

Analytical ultracentrifugation. Measured spectroscopically,
a FRET signal is an average of the behavior of all molecules
present in solution. This may result from a single population of
molecules in a given conformation or from a mixture of open
and closed conformations. To distinguish between these pos-
sibilities, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments

ratio, again reﬂecting the spectroﬂuorometric data. The local-
ization and FRET/donor ratio of the C-Helix-V protein were
identical to those of C-Helix-CTD-V. The construct expressing
the FERM domain alone, C-FERM-V, had a higher FRET/
donor ratio, consistent with the in vitro data. Interestingly,
C-FERM-V was predominately localized to the nucleus. The
full implication of this is unclear at this point, but at 90 kDa,
C-FERM-V is too large to passively diffuse into the nucleus,

suggesting active transport. In general, FRET/donor ratios de-
rived from multiple images representing living cells are re-
markably consistent and in close agreement with the spectro-
scopic data obtained from the corresponding puriﬁed proteins,
indicating that these ratios accurately represent the conforma-
tion of the deletion mutants in vivo and supporting the idea
that merlin exists in a constitutively closed conformation.

it into an open conformation (35). To determine if this confor-
mational change is detectable by FRET, we cotransfected SC4
cells with C-Mer-V and activated Rac, which induces phosphory-
lation of merlin at S518 via the effector kinase PAK (37). Spec-

troﬂuorometry carried out on lysates of cotransfected cells
showed a very modest decrease in FRET efﬁciency relative to
lysates with C-Mer-V and an empty vector (Fig. 8B), despite a
signiﬁcant increase in phosphorylation at S518 (Fig. 8A).

This result suggests that phosphorylation at S518 does not
dramatically inﬂuence merlin conformation. An alternative in-
terpretation, however, is that only a subpopulation of merlin
molecules was phosphorylated or that the merlin molecules in
the cell were phosphorylated to various degrees. In this sce-
nario, the modest FRET signal that we obtained would be an
average for all merlin molecules in a spectrum of conforma-
tion. To resolve this question, we examined the FRET behav-
ior of two mutant C-Mer-V variants with a phosphomimetic
aspartic acid substitution (S518D) and a nonphosphorylatable
alanine substitution (S518A). Surace et al. (42) reported pre-
viously that, in biological assays, these mutant merlin species
behave as fully phosphorylated and fully dephosphorylated
merlin. Both mutants showed small differences in FRET efﬁ-
ciency in puriﬁed, bacterially expressed proteins and in trans-
fected mammalian cell lysates (Fig. 8C and D).

In ezrin, binding to PIP2 is believed to precede phosphory-
lation of T567, a triggering event for opening of the molecule
(3, 6, 10, 49), and we and others have observed that merlin
binds PIP2 (30) (T. Mani, J.-J. Meng, and W. Ip, unpublished).
We therefore examined if the presence of PIP2 would have an
effect on the conformation of merlin. As shown in Fig. 8E, the
FRET efﬁciency of C-Mer-V is essentially unchanged by the
addition of PIP2 in vitro.

Taken together, these experiments show that while S518
phosphorylation has detectable effects on merlin conforma-
tion, as revealed by FRET measurements, the effects are sub-
tle, far less than might have been expected on the basis of the
current model.

Conformation of the merlin-NHERF complex. The merlin
binding protein, EBP50/NHERF, binds to the same groove in
the FERM domain as does the CTD domain (43). Therefore,
in the C-Mer-V–NHERF complex, where the CTD is displaced
by NHERF, merlin exists in what is by deﬁnition an “open”
conformation. Measuring FRET in C-Mer-V when it is in
complex with NHERF, therefore, will determine the magni-
tude of the shift from the closed to the open conformation.

We used GST pulldown to isolate full-length C-Mer-V
bound to GST-NHERF. As a positive control, we also isolated
the C-FERM-Helix-V mutant, which lacks the CTD and is
expected to bind GST-NHERF efﬁciently. As a negative con-
trol, we used C-Helix-CTD-V, the mutant that lacks the
FERM domain, the site of NHERF binding (Fig. 9A). The
FRET probes were mixed with either GST-NHERF beads or
GST beads in excess and repeatedly washed to remove merlin
not bound to NHERF. The bound merlin was then eluted with
glutathione. Any merlin that is present in the eluate is thus
fully bound to NHERF and in the open state. Binding was
quantiﬁed by measuring the ﬂuorescence of the proteins bound
to GST-NHERF.

As expected, the merlin FERM-Helix speciﬁcally bound
GST-NHERF but not GST. Conversely, Helix-CTD did not
bind GST-NHERF. Full-length C-Mer-V also speciﬁcally
bound to GST-NHERF, but much less efﬁciently than
C-FERM-Helix-V (Fig. 9B). FRET analysis of the fraction of
C-Mer-V that was GST-NHERF bound, and therefore fully
open, showed that when in a complex with GST-NHERF,
C-Mer-V has a slightly lower FRET efﬁciency than unbound
material, suggesting a conformational shift toward the open
state (Fig. 9C). This result provides independent conﬁrmation

MERLIN CONFORMATION

that the transition between the active and inactive states of
merlin involves a subtle conformational shift rather than a full
unfurling into an extended form.

DISCUSSION

The data presented here conﬁrm that changes in merlin
activity are accompanied by changes in conformation but sug-
gest that the mechanism and magnitude of these changes differ
substantially from those predicted by the current model. Our
studies employed FRET, utilizing two variants of GFP, Ceru-
lean and Venus, as the donor and acceptor pair, fused in frame
to the N and C termini of merlin, respectively. Since the efﬁ-
ciency of energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth
power of the distance between the donor and acceptor, FRET
is a sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic technique for mea-
suring molecular proximity in the 10- to 100-Å range (33).
Initially, the FRET-based strategy was judged to be feasible on
the basis of two crystal structures for the closely related ERM
protein moesin. In both structures, consisting of the moesin
FERM complexed with the CTD (32) and a 3-Å resolution
structure of full-length Sf-moesin (20), the distance between
the N- and the C-terminal amino acids is 54 Å, well within the
practical range of FRET for Cerulean and Venus. Further-
more, FRET has been successfully used for both radixin (12)
and ezrin (50, 51).

We validated our FRET probes by demonstrating that they
were functionally equivalent to untagged merlin by two crite-
ria: inhibition of signal transduction and growth suppression.
C-Mer-V inhibited the activity of the oncogene-induced imme-
diate-early transcription factor AP-1 as effectively as untagged
merlin. C-Mer-V also curtailed SC4 cell viability in a clono-
genic assay. It remains possible that the function of C-Mer-V is
different from that of untagged merlin in subtle ways that we
have not tested, but at the level of our analysis, the addition of
reporter proteins to either end of merlin did not abrogate its
activity.

We detected FRET in C-Mer-V by spectroﬂuorometry in
both transfected SC4 cell lysates and puriﬁed, bacterially ex-
pressed preparations. The efﬁciency of the FRET signal in
these experiments was on par with the published values for
radixin and ezrin (12, 50, 51). We excluded the possibility that
FRET signal could result from the dimerization of donor- and
acceptor-labeled merlin in three ways. First, coexpression of
C-Mer and Mer-V in cells at equivalent levels did not produce
FRET, ruling out merlin dimerization in a head-to-tail or an-
tiparallel fashion. Second, we observed FRET in a high-salt
environment, a condition known to favor merlin in the mono-
meric form (29). Finally, analytical ultracentrifugation experi-
ments demonstrated unequivocally that puriﬁed C-Mer-V ex-
ists predominately as a monomer, with essentially no dimeric
or oligomeric species. These data argue strongly that, in both
puriﬁed protein preparations and mammalian cell lysates, the
FRET arose from a population of merlin monomers in the
closed conformation.

We then used FERM domain and CTD deletion mutants to
identify merlin sequences responsible for the closed conforma-
tion. If the FERM-CTD interaction is responsible for the
closed conformation, as favored by the current model, then the
deletions should cause the molecule to unfold into an open

conformation, resulting in a loss of the FRET signal. Surpris-
ingly, all four deletion mutants displayed FRET efﬁciencies
equivalent to or greater than that of the full-length C-Mer-V
protein, as measured by both spectroscopy and live cell micros-
copy. In particular, C-Helix-V, the mutant that lacked both the
FERM domain and the CTD, had a robust FRET signal that
increased in a high-salt environment. As demonstrated by an-
alytical ultracentrifugation, it is monomeric and has a prolate
axial ratio very similar to that of the full-length molecule,
C-Mer-V. As FRET emanating from a monomeric population
of molecules can be explained only by the helix folding over on
itself, and this folding occurs even in the absence of the FERM
domain and the CTD, these results imply that the central
helical domain plays a role in specifying this closed conforma-
tion and, at the same time, suggest that the role of the FERM-
CTD interaction may be less essential than previously thought.
Measurement of C-Mer-V FRET under conditions of well-
deﬁned merlin activity showed that merlin does not undergo
large-scale structural changes as it becomes activated or inac-
tivated. Hyperphosphorylation of S518, brought about by ex-
pression of activated Rac, inactivates merlin and “opens” the
molecule (37). In lysates derived from cells overexpressing
activated Rac, we observed only a very small decrease in C-
Mer-V FRET efﬁciency. To ensure that the FRET change was
not due to a shift in the proportions of phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated merlin, we measured FRET of merlin with
the phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable substitutions at
S518, S518D and S518A, and found that these also had modest
effect on FRET in puriﬁed proteins and in mammalian cell
lysates. It is important to note, however, that the small differ-
ence in FRET efﬁciency between phosphorylated and unphos-
phorylated merlin is real and reproducible and suggests that
C-Mer-V is indeed slightly more closed in its unphosphorylat-
able state in spite of the subtlety of the conformational
changes.

FRET measurement of merlin isolated in an obligatory open
state further supports the hypothesis that merlin undergoes
structural changes of limited range. This was achieved by GST
pulldown using the FERM domain binding partner, NHERF.
FRET analysis reveals that C-Mer-V bound to GST-NHERF
is slightly more open than unbound merlin but that the ﬂuoro-
phores are nevertheless still close enough to support FRET,
consistent with the small shift in conformation seen in the
phosphorylation experiments.

Finally, FRET microscopy of live cells revealed that the
FRET/donor ratio of C-Mer-V is relatively constant across the
cell, with little or no variance of signal from different subcel-
lular structures. The subcellular uniformity in FRET efﬁciency
suggests that merlin conformation is relatively homogeneous
within the cell.

To summarize, by analyzing puriﬁed merlin and cell lysates
containing merlin of known phosphorylation states, by mea-
suring the FRET efﬁciency of fully ligand-bound merlin, and by
analyzing merlin FRET efﬁciency in live cells, we found no
evidence that inactive merlin unfolds into an extended confor-
mation that separates the FERM domain and the CTD by
more than 100 Å, thereby putting them out of FRET range.
Therefore, the transition between the inactive and active states
does not involve large-scale folding and unfolding of merlin as
previously believed.

While our results differ from the generally accepted model
of ERM conformational regulation, they are consistent with
the only published X-ray crystal structure of a full-length ERM
protein, Sf-moesin (20). This structure depicts the central
␣-helical domain as consisting of three subhelices, ␣A, ␣B, and
␣C, whose critical feature is that ␣C folds back on ␣B to form
an antiparallel coiled coil that juxtaposes the CTD and the
FERM domain. The coiled-coil nature of the central ␣-helical
domain may explain the behavior of C-Mer-V at different salt
concentrations. The strength of a coiled coil is dependent upon
interactions between the side chains of hydrophobic amino
acids at the “a” and “d” positions of the heptad repeat. Salt
concentrations greater than 1 M have the general effect of
strengthening the hydrophobic interactions within and be-
tween proteins and can screen unfavorable electrostatic inter-
actions (5). Thus, at 2.5 M NaCl, the coiled coil formed by the
␣B and ␣C helices may tighten, bringing the N and C termini
closer together, resulting in increased FRET efﬁciency. This
observation highlights the possibility that the central ␣-helix
may be an important point of control for ERM function, as has
been suggested by Li et al. in their study of Sf-moesin (20).
One could envision the central ␣-helical region as the site of
posttranslational modiﬁcation or of protein interaction that
changes the mean distance between the FERM domain and
the CTD, thereby controlling the access of effector proteins to
the FERM domain. This may be a more energetically feasible
way to control access to the FERM domain than to completely
unfold the central ␣-helical domain, a highly stable coiled coil
for the most part. This is also consistent with the modest
changes in conformation seen under different S518 phosphor-
ylation states and in the GST pulldown experiments. Clearly,
the function of the CTD is to block access of effector proteins,
like NHERF, to the FERM domain, but this may be achieved
by subtle differences in the FERM-CTD interaction rather
than dramatic changes in overall structure.

There is evidence that other ERM proteins may exist in
extended, open conformations. Analytical ultracentrifugation
and electron microscopy studies of puriﬁed radixin suggest that
it can exist as an asymmetric, 249-Å by 19-Å rod (12). This may
be explained by differences between the merlin and ERM
primary structures. The radixin central helix, like those of ezrin
and moesin, has a large number of polar amino acids that may
form ionic interactions and surface salt bridges that stabilize an
extended helix (12, 41). The merlin central ␣-helical region has
far fewer acidic and basic amino acids, possibly favoring the
stability of the coiled coil over the extended form (12, 19).

Our results paint a picture of merlin conformational regu-
lation that is more subtle and complex than was previously
envisioned. It seems likely that the regulation of merlin is not
a binary, on/off switch between active and inactive states. It is
also likely that merlin conformation is not deﬁned by either a
fully open molecule with unfettered access to the FERM do-
main or a completely closed molecule with no access. Instead,
we propose that the FERM domain and the CTD are main-
tained in close proximity at all times by the central ␣-helical
region, which is folded into a hairpin shape that is stabilized by
an antiparallel coiled-coil structure. Subtle changes in the
FERM-CTD interaction may be regulated by mechanisms that
act on the central ␣-helical coiled-coil, resulting in small alter-
ations in the distance between the FERM domain and the

CTD, thereby regulating the afﬁnity of this interaction and
modulating how it masks binding sites for effector proteins on
the FERM domain surface. The critical point of merlin regu-
lation, then, is the cooperation between the FERM-CTD in-
teraction and the central ␣-helical region to provide more-ﬁne-
tuned and nuanced access to docking sites on the FERM
domain, which implies a more sophisticated regulation of mer-
lin tumor suppressor function.
