Abstract

The signaling pathway of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is
important for cell growth, survival, and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of VEGF,
which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression. Dysregulation of the
MET/VEGF axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis.
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and VEGF receptor
2 (VEGFR2), as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor
pathobiology, including RET, KIT, AXL, and FLT3. Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and VEGFR2
phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to signiﬁcant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. In
mouse models, cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and
endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. Importantly, treatment with cabozantinib did not increase
lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of VEGF
signaling that do not target MET. Collectively, these data suggest that cabozantinib is a promising agent
for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated MET and VEGFR signaling.

Introduction

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is the only known
receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and its
signaling activity is required for embryogenesis, cell pro-
liferation, survival, and motility (1). While MET and HGF
are found in low levels in normal adult tissues, their
expression is frequently dysregulated in a broad spectrum
of human tumors. Ectopic activation of MET promotes
tumor cell survival, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and
metastasis (2, 3). In preclinical animal models, overexpres-
sion of MET and/or HGF has been shown to stimulate
tumorigenesis and metastasis (2, 4), whereas downregula-
tion of MET or HGF expression resulted in increased
apoptosis and decreased tumor growth and blood vessel
density (5, 6). Clinically, dysregulated expression of HGF

and/or MET has been observed in many different tumor
types, including glioma, melanoma, hepatocellular, renal,
gastric, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, breast, and lung
cancers, and is often correlated with poor prognosis
(1, 7). Collectively, these observations strongly implicate
MET/HGF signaling in the pathogenesis of human cancer.
Induction of angiogenesis has been increasingly recog-
nized as a crucial step in tumor progression and is one of
the hallmarks of cancerous growth. Correspondingly, the
proangiogenic signaling molecule VEGF and its receptors
VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 play key roles in tumor
development. HGF is also a potent angiogenic factor and
acts synergistically with VEGF to induce angiogenesis
(8, 9). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved
VEGF pathway inhibitors bevacizumab, sunitinib, and
sorafenib have proven to be clinically important in the
treatment of many types of cancer, but their effects are
characterized by initial clinical beneﬁt lasting weeks or
months before the resumption of tumor growth and
progression (10–12). Preclinical studies have found that
while continuous VEGF pathway inhibition initially
slows tumor growth and trims tumor vasculature, this is
quickly followed by rapid revascularization and
increased tumor invasiveness (13). These observations
show that cancers have the capacity to develop resistance
to VEGF pathway–targeted inhibition.

Tumor cell evasion of VEGF pathway–targeted inhibi-
tion may occur as a response to hypoxia. Under hypoxic
conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1a is upregulated,
resulting in increased expression of both VEGF and MET
(14, 15). These responses apparently allow the tumor cells
to compensate for the hypoxic environment through stim-
ulation of angiogenesis or migration away from the hyp-
oxic zone. Because VEGF pathway inhibition can result in
induction of hypoxia, it may also trigger upregulation of
MET expression, which may then stimulate tumor inva-
sion. Indeed, Shojaei and colleagues recently determined
that the MET pathway plays an important role in the
development of resistance to VEGF pathway inhibition
by sunitinib treatment (16). Recent studies have also
showed that the use of VEGFR inhibitors, such as sunitinib,
sorafenib, cediranib, or a VEGFR2-targeting antibody, can
result in the development of an aggressive tumor pheno-
type characterized by increased invasiveness and metas-
tasis and, in patients treated with cediranib, higher MET
expression levels (17–19). Therefore, targeting both arms of
the MET/VEGF axis simultaneously may critically disrupt
angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.

Cabozantinib (XL184) is a potent inhibitor of MET and
VEGFR2 that also inhibits RET, KIT, AXL, and FLT3, all of
which have been implicated in tumor pathogenesis (20,
21). In this study, we report on the consequences of
cabozantinib treatment on angiogenesis, cellular invasion,
tumor growth, and metastasis. Collectively, these data
suggest that cabozantinib may provide enhanced efﬁcacy
by simultaneously targeting key pathways important to
tumor survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

Materials and Methods

Compounds

Cabozantinib (Fig. 1A) was synthesized as described in
US Patent 7579473 (WO 2005030140 A2; ref. 22). For in vitro
assays, 10 mmol/L cabozantinib was prepared in dimeth-
yl sulfoxide and serially diluted in the appropriate assay
media. For in vivo studies, cabozantinib was formulated in
sterile saline/10 mmol/L HCl or in water and adminis-
tered via oral gavage at 10 mL/kg (mice) or 2 mL/kg
(rats).

Kinase inhibition assays

The inhibition proﬁle of cabozantinib against a broad
panel of 270 human kinases was determined using lucif-
erase-coupled chemiluminescence, 33P-phosphoryl trans-
fer, or AlphaScreen technology (PerkinElmer). Recombi-
nant human full-length, glutathione S-transferase tag, or
histidine tag fusion proteins were used, and half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by
measuring phosphorylation of peptide substrate poly
(Glu, Tyr) at ATP concentrations at or below the K
m for
each respective kinase. The mechanism of kinase inhibi-
tion was evaluated using the AlphaScreen Assay by
determining the IC50 values over a range of ATP
concentrations.

Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Effects of Cabozantinib

Cell lines

A431, B16F10, C6, H441, H69, Hs746T, HT1080, MS1,
PC3, SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, and U87MG cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection,
BaF3 cells were purchased from the German Resource
Center for Biological Material (DSMZ), and HMVEC-L
cells were purchased from BioWhitttaker Technologies.
MDA-MB-231 cells were a gift from Georgetown Univer-
sity School of Medicine, Washington, DC. No further
authentication was done on these lines. Cell lines were
passaged for less than 3 months and maintained in either
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Media (DMEM) or RPMI-
1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-

streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids at 37
C in
5% CO2. Where indicated, assays were conducted using
parental cell lines stably transfected with expression vec-
tors encoding kinases of interest.

Inhibition of receptor phosphorylation

Receptor phosphorylation of MET, VEGFR2, AXL, FLT3,
and KIT were, respectively, assessed in PC3, HUVEC,
MDA-MB-231, FLT3-transfected BaF3, and KIT-transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were serum starved for 3 to
24 hours, then incubated for 1 to 3 hours in serum-free
medium with serially diluted cabozantinib before
10-minute stimulation with ligand: HGF (100 ng/mL),
VEGF (20 ng/mL), SCF (100 ng/mL), or ANG1
(300 ng/mL). All ligands were purchased from R&D
Systems. Receptor phosphorylation was determined either
by ELISA using speciﬁc capture antibodies and quantita-
tion of total phosphotyrosine (Zymed, Inc.) or immuno-
precipitation and Western blotting with speciﬁc antibodies
and quantitation of total phosphotyrosine (4G10; UpState
Biotechnology). Total protein served as loading controls.

Endothelial cell tubule formation assays

Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC)
were mixed with serially diluted cabozantinib, then
immediately added to cultures of normal human diploid
ﬁbroblasts in the presence or absence of 60 ng/mL VEGF
for 7 days. Conditioned media from MDA-MB-231, A431,
HT1080, and B16F10 cells were also used as a source of
secreted growth factors. Following ﬁxation, tubule for-
mation was detected using the endothelial cell marker
CD31 (clone WM59; BD Biosciences) and visualized with
an immunoperoxidase detection system (Artisan AEC
Detection Kit; Dako). Digital images were captured using
an inverted microscope (20), and total tube length was
quantitated with Metamorph (Molecular Devices).

Invasion and migration assays

B16F10 cells (2  105) were seeded onto 0.8 mm mem-
branes in the upper chambers of a 96-well Transwell plate
in the absence or presence of Matrigel (BD Pharmingen;
BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with serially dilut-
ed cabozantinib in DMEM/0.1% FBS. The lower chambers
contained HGF (50 ng/mL) and the appropriate concen-
tration of cabozantinib. After 24 hours, cells were

ed with calcein AM (Molecular Probes; Invitrogen) and
digital images captured with a ﬂuorescence microscope.
MS1 mouse endothelial cells were plated in 96-well plates
coated with ﬁbronectin. A cell-free zone was created that
was followed by treatment with serially diluted cabozan-
tinib and 30 ng/mL VEGF or 30 ng/mL HGF. After 20
hours, cell migration was determined from digitally cap-
tured images.

Cellular proliferation

Cells were seeded in triplicate overnight in media con-
taining 10% FBS. The next day, cells were treated with
serial dilutions of cabozantinib for 48 hours, followed by
analysis of proliferation using Cell Proliferation ELISA,
BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science).

In vivo inhibition of receptor phosphorylation

Female nu/nu mice (Taconic) were housed according to
the Exelixis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines. H441 cells (3  106) were implanted intrader-
mally into the hind ﬂank and when tumors reached
approximately 150 mg, tumor weight was calculated
using the formula: (tumor volume ¼ length (mm) 
width2 (mm2)]/2, mice were randomized (n ¼ 5 per
group) and orally administered a single 100 mg/kg dose
of cabozantinib or vehicle. Tumors were collected at the
indicated time points. Pooled tumor lysates were sub-
jected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MET (SC161;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Western blotting with
anti-phosphotyrosine MET (pY1230/34/35; BioSource
International). After blot stripping, total MET was quan-
titated as a loading control. In a separate experiment,
naive mice (n ¼ 5 per group) were administered a single

100 mg/kg dose of cabozantinib or vehicle, followed by
intravenous administration of HGF (10 mg per mouse) 10
minutes before liver collection. Analysis of MET phos-
phorylation in liver lysates was as described above. In a
separate experiment, naive mice (n ¼ 5 per group) were
administered a single 100 mg/kg dose of cabozantinib or
vehicle, followed by intravenous administration of VEGF
(10 mg per mouse) 30 minutes before lung collection.
Pooled lung lysates were subjected to immunoprecipita-
tion with FLK1 (SC6251; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10,
Upstate Biotechnology). After blot stripping, total FLK1
was quantitated as a loading control.

Immunohistochemistry
MDA-MB-231 cells (1  106) were implanted subcuta-
neously into the uncleared mammary fat pad of nu/nu
mice. When the tumors reached approximately 100 mg
(12 days after implantation), mice were randomized (n¼ 8
per group) and orally administered cabozantinib (100
mg/kg) or saline vehicle once daily for 4 days. Body
weights were collected daily. Four hours before tumor
harvest, animals were injected intraperitoneally with 60
mg/kg pimonidazole to facilitate visualization of tumor
hypoxia. Tumors were resected at 4 and 8 hours after the
ﬁrst dose and 4 hours after the second, third, and fourth
doses, respectively, snap frozen in optimum cutting
temperature (Miles, Inc.) and processed for staining
for hypoxia (Hypoxyprobe-1; Chemicon), vascularity
[endothelial cell marker MECA-32 (#550563, BD Bio-
sciences)], and proliferation [Ki67 (#RM-9106-S; Lab
Vision)]. Apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-
ase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)] deter-
mination was carried out using an In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche). Digital ﬂuorescent images were
captured using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 with AxioVision (Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging LLC) image analysis software. One to
5 nonoverlapping representative ﬁelds were captured at
5 (hypoxia, TUNEL, Ki67), 100 (MECA-32), and 400
(endothelial cell death) magniﬁcation and quantiﬁed
using Metamorph (Molecular Devices).

Solid tumor efﬁcacy studies
On day 0 in nu/nu mice, cells were inoculated
intradermally into the hind ﬂank (3  106 cells, H441) or
subcutaneously into a noncleared mammary fat pad
(1  106 cells, MBA-MB-231). When tumors reached
approximately 100 mg (12–14 days after implantation),
mice were randomized (n ¼ 10 per group) and treated
orally once daily for 14 days with cabozantinib or saline
vehicle. In a separate study, MDA-MB-231 tumors were
allowed to reach approximately 500 or 1,000 mg before
randomization and initiation of cabozantinib treatment.
On day 0 in female Wistar rats (Charles River Laborato-
ries), C6 cells (5  106) were inoculated subcutaneously
into the hind ﬂank. When the tumors reached approxi-
mately 250 mg (3–4 days postimplantation), rats were
randomized (n ¼ 8 per group) and treated orally once

daily for 12 days with cabozantinib or water vehicle.
Body weights were collected daily, and tumor weights
were collected twice weekly. Percentage of tumor growth
inhibition/regression values were expressed as follows:
1   [(mean treated tumor weight on the ﬁnal day   mean
tumor weight on day 0)/(mean vehicle tumor weight on
the ﬁnal day   mean tumor weight on day 0)]  100.
Statistical analysis of cabozantinib-treated tumors versus
vehicle-treated tumors or versus predose tumors was done
by one-way ANOVA with signiﬁcance deﬁned as P < 0.05.
Blood was collected 4 hours after the ﬁnal dose, and plasma
was prepared to determine cabozantinib concentrations.

Experimental metastasis
On day 1, MDA-MB-231 cells (1  106) were implanted
via tail vein injection into nu/nu mice that was immedi-
ately followed by randomization (n ¼ 12–15 per group)
and oral treatment with cabozantinib (60 mg/kg), suniti-
nib (120 mg/kg), or vehicle for 28 days. On day 28, lungs
were perfused in situ with India ink solution (15% in PBS),
resected, and lung wet weights immediately captured.
Lungs were destained and ﬁxed in Fekete’s buffer (70%
ethanol, 4% formaldehyde, glacial acetic acid; 20:2:1) for
72 hours, then transferred to 70% ethanol until image
acquisition and analysis as previously described (23).
Brieﬂy, each lung was separated into 5 lobes, and ventral
and dorsal surface aspects were digitally captured with
lobes submerged under water. Images were analyzed by
Deﬁniens Developer XD to assess lung tumor foci counts.
The number of tumor foci for ventral and dorsal lung
surface aspects were obtained after applying size thresh-
old parameters to exclude foci with diameters below
4 pixels from analysis (23). As the tumor foci data did
not pass the normality and Gaussian distribution tests,
statistical analysis was conducted via nonparametric
ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis analysis).

Results

Cabozantinib inhibits kinase activity

The selectivity of cabozantinib (Fig. 1A) was proﬁled
against a protein kinase panel of approximately 270
human kinases. Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of MET
and VEGFR2 with IC50 values of 1.3 and 0.035 nmol/L,
respectively (Table 1). MET-activating kinase domain
mutations Y1248H, D1246N, or K1262R were also inhib-
¼ 3.8, 11.8, and 14.6 nmol/L,
ited by cabozantinib (IC50
respectively). Cabozantinib displayed strong inhibition of
several kinases that have also been implicated in tumor
pathobiology, including KIT, RET, AXL, TIE2, and FLT3
¼ 4.6, 5.2, 7, 14.3, and 11.3 nmol/L, respectively).
(IC50
Kinases not potently inhibited include RON, EGFR,
IGFR1, and EphA4/B4. In cellular assays, cabozantinib
inhibited phosphorylation of MET and VEGFR2, as well
as KIT, FLT3, and AXL with IC50 values of 7.8, 1.9, 5.0, 7.5,

Cabozantinib inhibits endothelial cell tubule

HMVEC cells were incubated with VEGF in the pres-
ence of cabozantinib and tubule formation visualized by
immunostaining for CD31. Cabozantinib inhibited tubule
formation with an IC50 value of 6.7 nmol/L (Fig. 1B) with
no evidence of cytotoxicity, showing that cabozantinib
exerts an antiangiogenic rather than cytotoxic effect.

respectively.

Cabozantinib inhibits tumor cell proliferation in a
variety of tumor types

The effect of cabozantinib on proliferation was eval-
uated in a number of human tumor cell lines. SNU-5
and Hs746T cells harboring ampliﬁed MET (26) were

¼ 19 and 9.9
the most sensitive to cabozantinib (IC50
nmol/L, respectively); however, SNU-1 and SNU-16
cells lacking MET ampliﬁcation were more resistant
¼ 5,223 and 1,149 nmol/L, respectively). MDA-
(IC50
MB-231 and U87MG cells exhibited comparable levels
¼ 6,421 and 1,851
of sensitivity to cabozantinib (IC50
nmol/L, respectively), whereas H441, H69, and PC3 cell
lines were the least sensitive to cabozantinib with IC50
values of 21,700, 20,200, and 10,800 nmol/L, respec-
tively.
In addition, BaF3 cells expressing human
FLT3-ITD, an activating mutation in acute myelogenous
¼ 15
leukemia (27), were sensitive to cabozantinib (IC50
nmol/L) when compared with wild-type BaF3 cells
(IC50

¼ 9,641 nmol/L).

Cabozantinib inhibits MET and VEGFR2
phosphorylation in vivo

A single 100 mg/kg oral dose of cabozantinib resulted
in inhibition of phosphorylation of MET 2 to 8 hours
postdose in H441 tumors that harbor constitutively phos-
phorylated MET (Fig. 2A). This result is consistent with
data showing the sensitivity of these cells to inhibitors
selective for MET and MET knockdown by siRNA (28, 29).
This effect was reversible, as MET phosphorylation
returned to basal levels by 48 hours after treatment. In
separate experiments, cabozantinib inhibited in vivo stim-
ulation of MET phosphorylation by HGF in liver hepato-
cytes (Fig. 2B) and VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of
FLK1 (Fig. 2C) with inhibition of both targets sustained
through 8 hours postdose. Furthermore, cabozantinib
eliminated endogenous levels of phosphorylated FLK1
that are present in the absence of VEGF stimulation.

Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Effects of Cabozantinib

Figure 2. Cabozantinib treatment
results in inhibition of
phosphorylation of MET in tumor
and liver tissue and
phosphorylation of FLK1 in lung
tissue following a single oral dose.
A, mice bearing H441 tumors were
administered a single oral dose of
cabozantinib (100 mg/kg) or water
vehicle, and levels of
phosphorylated and total MET in
tumor lysates were determined. B,
naive mice were administered a
single dose of cabozantinib
(100 mg/kg) or water vehicle. Ten
minutes before harvest, mice were
intravenously administered HGF
(10 mg per animal), and levels of
phosphorylated and total MET in
liver lysates were determined.
C, naive mice were administered a
single dose of cabozantinib
(100 mg/kg) or water vehicle. Thirty
minutes before harvest, mice were
intravenously administered VEGF
(10 mg per animal), and levels of
phosphorylated and total FLK1 in
lung lysates were determined.

Cabozantinib disrupts tumor vasculature and
promotes tumor and endothelial cell death

antiangiogenic-sensitive MDA-MB-231

To examine the effect of cabozantinib on tumor vascu-
lature,
cells
expressing MET and VEGF were used (28, 30). Tumor-
bearing animals were administered a 100-mg/kg oral
dose, and tumors were collected 4 and 8 hours after the
ﬁrst dose and 4 hours after the consecutive second, third,
and fourth doses. Vehicle-treated tumors exhibited low
levels of hypoxia (1%) and TUNEL (0.5%), and high
levels of Ki67 (60%) and MECA-32 (20%), indicative of
viable, highly proliferative, and vascularized tumors
(data not shown). Cabozantinib signiﬁcantly increased
tumor hypoxia (13-fold; Fig. 3A) and apoptosis (TUNEL;
2.5-fold; Fig. 3B) at 8 and 4 hours after the ﬁrst and second
doses, respectively, when compared with vehicle-treated
tumors collected at the same time point. Concomitant
reductions in the proliferation marker Ki67 (19%; Fig.

3C) and the endothelial cell surface marker MECA-32
(12%; Fig. 3D) were also observed 8 hours after a single
dose. Progressive, marked changes in these endpoints
continued such that after the third dose, the number of
apoptotic and hypoxic cells were elevated 78- and 85-fold,
respectively, whereas marked reductions in Ki67 (55%)
and MECA-32 (75%) were also evident. Summarized
quantitative data are provided in Supplementary Table
S3. Despite these profound and progressive effects of
cabozantinib on tumor physiology, animals seemed
healthy with no visible signs of toxicity or loss of body
weight (data not shown).

The rapid decrease of MECA-32 prompted closer exam-
ination of tumor endothelial cell survival. Simultaneous
examination of TUNEL-, MECA-32-, and 4
,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole–stained cells
revealed cabozantinib-
induced cell death not only in tumor cells but also in
endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature (Fig. 3E). Taken

increases in tumor hypoxia (A) and

231 tumor-bearing mice were orally
administered cabozantinib (100
mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 4
days. Tumors were resected 4 and 8
hours after the ﬁrst dose and 4

to vehicle-treated control tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). In a similar but separate study with larger MDA-
MB-231 tumors, a 10-mg/kg dose resulted in induction of
stable disease that was independent of initial tumor size
(Fig. 4B), whereas a 60-mg/kg dose resulted in signiﬁcant
tumor regression of both 500-mg (37%, P ¼ 0.0003) and
1,000-mg (45%, P ¼ 0.0001) tumors. Cabozantinib inhib-
ited growth of H441 tumors at all doses (P < 0.001), with
dose-dependent inhibition observed for the 10- and 30-
mg/kg doses (Fig. 4C). The 60-mg/kg dose resulted in
signiﬁcant tumor regression (33%, P < 0.005) when com-
pared with predose tumor weights. As elevated MET
expression has been detected in human gliomas and
implicated in glioma cell growth (29, 31), the antitumor
effect of cabozantinib in the MET-expressing rat C6 glio-
ma cell line (32) was determined. Cabozantinib inhibited
tumor growth (P < 0.001) for all doses when compared
with vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the
3- and 10-mg/kg doses resulted in signiﬁcant tumor
regression (62 and 85%, P < 0.0001) when compared with
predose tumor weights. In a separate experiment, a single
10-mg/kg dose resulted in C6 tumor growth inhibition

together, these results show that cabozantinib disrupts
tumor vasculature by inducing endothelial cell death that
negatively impacts tumor viability.

Cabozantinib inhibits tumor growth in a
dose-dependent manner

The in vivo efﬁcacy of cabozantinib was evaluated in
human tumor models in rodents over a period of time that
corresponded to exponential tumor growth of each mod-
el. Cabozantinib treatment resulted in signiﬁcant tumor
growth inhibition of MDA-MB-231 tumors (P < 0.001) for
all doses when compared with vehicle-treated tumors
(Fig. 4A). Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for
the 3- and 10-mg/kg doses (P < 0.01). At the 30- and 60-
mg/kg doses, cabozantinib induced stable disease. Con-
tinuous treatment at these doses was associated with
plasma concentrations of 9,000 to 16,000 nmol/L, which

was 2-fold above IC50 values for cellular proliferation

and tubule formation with MDA-MB-231 conditioned
media. A single 100 mg/kg dose resulted in sustained
MDA-MB-231 tumor growth inhibition for approximately
8 days after which tumors began growing at a rate similar

Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Effects of Cabozantinib

tumor growth and promotes tumor
regression. Animals bearing
established MDA-MB-231 (A and
B), H441 (C), and C6 (D) tumors
were orally administered once daily

1 mg/kg (D), 3 mg/kg (r), 10 mg/kg

for 12 to 14 days, depending on the
model. Tumor weights were

that was sustained during a 15-day observation period
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). On a body weight dosage basis,
cabozantinib plasma exposures ranged from 6- to 10-fold
higher in rats than in mice (Supplementary Table S4),
which accounts for lower doses inducing tumor growth
inhibition/regression in rats than in mice. Subchronic
administration of cabozantinib was well tolerated in mice
and rats with no signs of toxicity, as determined by stable
and/or increasing body weights during the treatment
period (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D).

Cabozantinib does not promote metastasis following
intravenous tumor cell inoculation

The impact of cabozantinib on metastasis to that of
VEGFR2-targeting therapies, known to promote metas-
tasis in preclinical models (17), was investigated. Imme-
diately following intravenous injection of MDA-MB-231
cells into mice, oral cabozantinib or sunitinib treatment
was initiated and continued once daily for 28 days.
Examination of intact lungs from cabozantinib-treated
mice revealed no apparent difference in lung surface
tumor burden when compared with lungs from vehicle-
treated control animals (Fig. 5A); however, lungs from
sunitinib-treated animals displayed an apparent

increase in tumor burden. Quantitation of tumor foci
per lobe surface revealed no statistical difference
in the number of foci for vehicle- and cabozantinib-
treated mice (56 vs. 64 foci/lobe surface, P > 0.05) and a
2-fold increase in tumor foci for sunitinib-treated mice
(109 foci/lobe surface, P < 0.001; Fig. 5B). Additional
evidence of inhibition of metastasis was conﬁrmed
by lack of a signiﬁcant increase (P > 0.05) in whole lung
wet weights in cabozantinib-treated animals (Fig. 5C).
Cabozantinib treatment was well tolerated as deter-
mined by stable body weights throughout the 28-day
treatment period.

Discussion

The MET signaling pathway has been shown to be
important in tumor growth, survival, and metastasis and
acts synergistically with VEGF to promote angiogenesis
(8, 9). Both MET and VEGF are found to be dysregulated in
many tumor types, resulting in tumor angiogenesis and
tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Because of the
synergistic effects of MET and VEGFR signaling, inhibit-
ing both arms of the MET/VEGF axis may offer signiﬁcant
beneﬁt over targeting either pathway individually.

Importantly,

In tumor cells, inappropriate activation of MET occurs
through overexpression of wild-type MET or its ligand
HGF or as a result of activating mutations in the gene
encoding MET.
cabozantinib potently
inhibits both wild-type MET and MET with activating
mutations, such as those frequently found in hereditary
papillary renal and hepatocellular carcinomas (33, 34).
Further evidence for the potent activity of cabozantinib
comes from cell proliferation studies, where it robustly
inhibited cell lines known to be dependent on MET but not
cell lines known to be independent of MET.

As shown in this report, cabozantinib exhibits potent
and reversible inhibition of its targets, leading to disrup-
tion of cellular processes that have been implicated in
angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, including migration and
tubule formation. This translates into profound changes in
tumor physiology, including widespread endothelial and
tumor cell apoptosis, disruptions in tumor vasculature,
and increased hypoxia. Subchronic treatment with cabo-
zantinib results in broad antitumor efﬁcacy, and in some
models, tumor regression; however, a single dose exhibits
antitumor efﬁcacy for approximately 8 to 15 days in the
models examined.

We used a variety of tumor models that are driven by
diverse mechanisms. H441 cells overexpress constitutive-
ly active MET as well as activated EGFR, HER2, and HER3
(35). C6 rat glioma cells overexpress MET and are PTEN
deﬁcient (32, 36). While MDA-MB-231 cells do not over-
express MET, they are responsive to HGF and also harbor
mutationally activated forms of RAS and RAF (37, 38).

None of these cell lines are known to be strictly addicted to
or dependent on signaling through MET for proliferation,
consistent with their relative resistance to cabozantinib in
vitro. However, our studies with cabozantinib suggest that
the observed antitumor efﬁcacy is the result of mechan-
isms affecting tumor angiogenesis and the blockade of
invasive tumor growth rather than the result of directly
targeting cellular proliferation.

One of the limitations of VEGF-targeted therapies has
been a lack of enduring clinical beneﬁt. Bergers and
Hanahan recently theorized that tumor cells may develop
resistance to antiangiogenic therapies through adaptive
mechanisms such as upregulation of alternative proan-
giogenic signaling pathways and enhancement of metas-
tasis (39). Indeed, VEGFR inhibitors such as sunitinib,
sorafenib, cediranib, VEGFR2-targeting antibodies, and
neutralizing antimurine VEGF antibodies have all been
observed to increase the invasiveness and/or metastatic
potential of tumors (17, 18, 19, 40). Ebos and colleagues
hypothesized that treatment with sunitinib may lead to
upregulation of cytokines that promote metastasis (17),
and recent studies have suggested that the MET/HGF
pathway is important for proangiogenic and prometa-
static signaling in the context of VEGF inhibition
(16, 19, 40). In light of these observations, it is interesting
that our results show that cabozantinib produces potent
antitumor and antiangiogenic effects without increasing
tumor metastatic potential, unlike treatment with suniti-
nib, suggesting that targeting MET and VEGFR2 simul-
taneously may cut off metastatic escape pathways. A

recent study using RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice similarly
showed that treatment with cabozantinib resulted in more
extensive tumor shrinkage and decreased tumor invasive-
ness and metastasis than treatment with vehicle or anti-
VEGF antibody. Strikingly, in that study, all of the mice
treated with cabozantinib survived until the experiment
ended at 20 weeks, whereas none of the vehicle- or anti-
VEGF antibody–treated mice survived to that endpoint
(40). Together, these data suggest that inhibiting MET and
VEGFR2 with cabozantinib effectively blocks the devel-
opment of MET-driven evasive resistance seen with
agents targeting the VEGF pathway alone, thereby pro-
viding a more sustained antitumor effect.

Our results provide support for testing cabozantinib
in a broad variety of tumors where MET activation has
been implicated and/or VEGF pathway inhibitors have
shown efﬁcacy. Cabozantinib is currently being studied
in clinical trials in a number of tumor types, including
medullary and differentiated thyroid, prostate, ovarian,
non–small cell
lung, hepatocellular, renal cell, and
breast cancers, as well as melanoma and glioblastoma
(41). In clinical trials, cabozantinib was generally well
tolerated, with promising clinical activity and response
in multiple tumor types (42–49). The data presented
