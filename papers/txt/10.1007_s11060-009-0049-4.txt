Abstract Plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PNF), one of the
major features of neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), are
characterized by complex cellular composition and mostly
slow but variable growth patterns.
In this study, we
examined the effect of imatinib mesylate, a receptor tyro-
sine kinase inhibitor, on PNF-derived Schwann cells and
PNF tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PNF-
derived primary Schwann cells express platelet-derived
growth factors receptors (PDGFR) a and b, both targets of

imatinib, and cell viability was reduced by imatinib mes-
ylate, with 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 10 lM.
For in vivo studies, PNF tumour fragments xenografted
onto the sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice were ﬁrst
characterized. The tumours persisted for at least 63 days
and maintained typical characteristics of PNFs such as
complex cellular composition, low proliferation rate and
angiogenesis. A transient enlargement of the graft size was
due to inﬂammation by host cells. Treatment with imatinib
mesylate at a daily dose of 75 mg/kg for 4 weeks reduced
the graft size by an average of 80% (n = 8), signiﬁcantly
different from the original sizes within the group and from
sizes of the grafts in 11 untreated mice in the control group
(P \ 0.001). We demonstrated that grafting human PNF
tumour fragments into nude mice provides an adequate
in vivo model for drug testing. Our results provide in vivo
and in vitro evidence for efﬁcacy of imatinib mesylate for
PNF.

Background

Neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominantly
inherited disease characterized by multiple neuroﬁbromas,
melanogenic abnormalities, bone defects and cognitive
deﬁcits, among other characteristics. The genetic causes for
NF1 are heterozygous inactivating mutations of the NF1
tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 17.

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PNF) are present in 30–50%
of NF1 patients [1, 2]. Unlike cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, the
hallmark of NF1 in which tumours are mostly small and
mainly of cosmetic relevance, PNF grow to various sizes,
inﬁltrate the surrounding tissues and often have signiﬁcant
clinical consequences,
including severe disﬁgurement,
pain, organ compression and other functional impairments.
PNF can become extremely large, and some of them affect
the whole face, arm or leg. Occasionally, large lesions can
erode adjacent bones and thus produce skeletal instability.
Our recent study showed growth of PNF mostly in early
childhood and adolescence [3]. PNF is the precursor of
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST),
which develops in 6–13% of NF1 patients and is the
leading cause of death due to this condition [4].

To date, treatment of PNF has been limited to surgical
intervention. However, since the tumours often inﬁltrate
adjacent tissues, complete resection is usually not pos-
sible without damaging nerves and healthy tissues. Cur-
rently, there is no established medical therapy available
for PNF.

Imatinib mesylate (Glivec) is a receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor that targets platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-a and -b, c-Kit, Bcr-Abl and Arg-kinase, and that
exhibited efﬁcacy for some cancers [5, 6]. We have pre-
viously shown that imatinib mesylate inhibits growth of
MPNST cells in vitro [7], raising the hope that this drug
may also be beneﬁcial for benign PNF. A recent study
showed that c-Kit inhibition by imatinib mesylate leads to
reduced mast cell
inﬁltration and neuroﬁbroma growth
inhibition in a transgenic mouse model of NF1 [8].

In the present study, we examined the effect of imatinib
mesylate on the viability of primary PNF-derived Schwann
cells in vitro and its impact on size and survival of PNF-
derived tumour fragments in vivo.

Materials and methods

Patients and tumours

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas were obtained from seven unre-
lated NF1 patients who underwent surgery at the University
Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf (age range 12–57 years,
mean 34 ± 7.208 years; ﬁve male, two female). Diagnosis

123

of NF1 was conducted according to the modiﬁed National
Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria [9]. All patients gave
informed written consent, and the local ethics committee
approved the study protocol. After saving sufﬁcient mate-
rial for histological examination, parts of each specimen
were used to establish primary Schwann cell cultures and/
or for xenografting into nude mice.

Schwann cell cultivation and treatment
with imatinib mesylate

PNF from ﬁve patients (age range 16–57 years, mean
42 ± 7.2595 years; four male, one female) were cut into
small pieces and placed overnight in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM glutamine and 2 mM sodium pyruvate
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cultivation and enrich-
ment of Schwann cells was carried out as previously
described [10]; heregulin was kindly provided by S. Car-
roll (Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama
at Birmingham). Proportion of Schwann cells was deﬁned
as the number of S100-positive Schwann cells divided by
the number of nuclei stained with 40,6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole (DAPI, Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, USA).

For imatinib mesylate treatment, 10,000 cells were
seeded in 100 ll medium into each well of a 96-well plate
for viability assays or in chambers for immunocytochem-
istry. Imatinib mesylate (kindly provided by Novartis
Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) was dissolved in water,
and added at ﬁnal concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 lM.
Medium was changed every 5 days. Cell viability was
evaluated on days 7, 14 and 28 of imatinib treatment using
the XTT proliferation assay (Promega, Mannheim, Ger-
many) by measurement of absorbance at 490 nm. Each
drug concentration was tested in 12 replicates. Vitality and
ﬁnal number of cells was determined at the end of the
experiment using Trypan Blue exclusion.

Xenograft implantation and imatinib mesylate
treatment

Tumour tissue from freshly resected PNFs (12-year-old
female and 16-year-old male) was placed in sterile DMEM
and cut into 4–9 mm3 pieces. These tumour pieces were
soaked in Matrigel (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany)
at 4°C and their sizes were determined using a calliper.
Female athymic nu/nu Balb/c mice (Charles River, Sulz-
feld, Germany) were anaesthetised with a mixture of xy-
lasin and ketamin. A small incision was made into the skin
to expose the sciatic nerve, and then an incision was made
into the sciatic nerve, onto which one tumour piece was
implanted. Muscle and skin layers were closed and sutured.
To determine graft volume changes after transplantation,

mice were sacriﬁced at days 7 (n = 4), 21 (n = 4), 35
(n = 3) and 63 (n = 3) to determine size and for histo-
logical analysis.

(treatment) were

For treatment with imatinib mesylate, Alzet mini-pumps
containing either phosphate-buffered saline (control) or
imatinib mesylate
subcutaneously
implanted into the back of mice [11]. Drug release was set
to 75 mg/kg per day with pumping rate of 0.2 ll/h [12],
giving an in vivo concentration in excess of the IC50
(10 lM) determined for
inhibition of Schwann cell
proliferation.

Imatinib mesylate treatment was started at day 7 and
continued until day 35 post grafting. Mice were kept alive
for further 28 days without treatment and sacriﬁced at
day 63. Because of inﬂammation at the Alzet pump site,
four mice of the treatment group had to be discontinued
and were not included in the evaluation. Graft size was
measured with a calliper and the volume was calculated as
(p/48)(length ? width)3. All animal experiments were
approved by the local authority.

Histology

Tumours were ﬁxed in 7% formalin and embedded in
parafﬁn. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) or with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain to
speciﬁcally detect mast cells. In addition, a series of
immunohistochemical stainings were carried out using
anti-human S100 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:800, Dako, Ham-
burg, Germany), anti-human Ki67 (rabbit monoclonal 1:50,
Neomarkers, Asbach, Germany), anti-mouse macrophage
surface marker CD68 (mouse monoclonal, 1:100, R&D
Systems) and anti-human glutathione transferase (GST)
(mouse monoclonal, 1:100, ABCAM, Cambridge, USA).
Antibodies against human vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) (rabbit polyclonal 1:500) and FLK-1 (rabbit
polyclonal, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany) were used to detect blood vessels, while iso-
lectin B4 (biotinylated, 20 lg/ml, Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK) was used to detect speciﬁcally mouse
and non-human endothelial cells. For antibody detection,
Envision Kit dual system peroxidase (Dako, Hamburg,
Germany) was used. For isolectin detection,
the ABC
reagent (Vector Laboratories) was used. Colour reactions
were developed with VectorRed (Vector Laboratories), and
the nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin.

Expression of receptor tyrosine kinases was examined
by immunoﬂuorescence staining on parafﬁn-embedded
sections. Antigen retrieval was enhanced by heating in a
microwave. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PDGFR-a
(1:50) and PDGFR-b (1:50) were from Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, while the antibody against c-Kit (1:100) was
obtained from Dako. As secondary antibodies we utilized

1:100 dilutions of Cy3- (Dianova) and Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated (Invitrogen) anti-rabbit Ig. Nuclei were coun-
terstained with DAPI. As positive controls we used skin
and tonsil tissue. Negative control stainings without pri-
mary antibodies did not produce signals.

For immunocytochemistry, Schwann cells were grown
on chamber slides, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with antibodies against S100, PDGFR-a, and
PDGFR-b. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:1,000)
from Invitrogen was used as the secondary antibody.
Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.

Mast cells stained with PAS were counted within the
graft and in the adjacent inﬂammatory area at 409 mag-
niﬁcation. The total area of the section was measured using
morphometry software (Zeiss, Axiovision, V4.6), and the
mast cell density was calculated as mast cells/mm2 for each
section. Five sections from the control and three from the
imatinib mesylate-treated group were counted.

Data analysis

The effect of imatinib mesylate on viability of cultured
PNF Schwann cells was tested using non-parametric
analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Kruskal–Wallis test), and
if signiﬁcant, post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test was
performed.

We used non-parametric one-way ANOVA to compare
graft sizes at days 7, 21, 35 and 63 (untreated), which were
normalized to the original size at grafting. If changes were
signiﬁcant, Dunn’s post hoc test was applied for further
analysis. A non-parametric test (Mann–Whitney test) was
used to examine difference in graft sizes between the
control and the treated groups before transplantation. The
same test was used to assess possible differences in mast
cell density between grafts from the control group and
those from the treatment group. To analyse the effects of
imatinib mesylate on graft sizes, non-parametric one-way
ANOVA was applied for pairwise comparison of each graft
before and after treatment, and when signiﬁcant, post–hoc
analysis (Dunn’s test) was used to compare changes within
the groups. Statistical signiﬁcance levels were set
to
P = 0.05. Graphpad Prism software was used for all sta-
tistical analyses. Averaged values are expressed as
mean ± standard deviation (SD).

showed that PDFGR-a was mainly expressed in S100-
positive Schwann cells (Fig. 1c), and also co-expressed
with PDGFR-b (Fig. 1d insert). Co-expression of
the
PDGFRs was also seen in blood vessels (Fig. 1e). c-Kit-
positive cells within the PNF morphologically resembled
mast cells (Fig. 1f).

Expression of PDFGR-a and PDGFR-b was also
detected in primary Schwann cell cultures derived from
human PNF (Fig. 1h, i).

reduced cell viability signiﬁcantly, with P \ 0.05 and
P \ 0.001, respectively (Fig. 2). The total number and the
proportion of vital cells were counted at the end of the
experiment for non-treated and 10 lM treated groups.
While the number of cells increased to 608% (±101) in the
control group, cells treated with imatinib only increased to
308% (±137). No differences were observed in the pro-
portion of vital cells (non-treated: 86.74 ± 4.083%; treated
85.053 ± 6.96%). In addition, the cells changed to a more
compact morphology after treatment with 10 lM imatinib
mesylate for 28 days (Fig. 1j, k).

No effect on cell viability was detected at days 7 or 14

of treatment using the XTT assay (data not shown).

Primary Schwann cell cultures were derived from ﬁve
human PNF. More than 85% of the cells were S100 posi-
tive and exhibited an elongated, spindle-shaped morphol-
ogy, which is

Fig. 2 Imatinib mesylate treatment reduced viability of PNF Schw-
ann cells. Primary Schwann cell cultures derived from PNF were
treated with imatinib mesylate at various concentrations for 28 days.
Data was normalized from the absorbance values of untreated cells
and data are expressed as percentage cell viability. Signiﬁcant
reduction in cell viability was detected for 5 and 10 lM imatinib
mesylate treatment (*P \ 0.05 and ***P \ 0.001, respectively) when
compared with untreated cells

(n = 14) were sacriﬁced at different
time points after
transplantation [days 7 (n = 4), 21 (n = 4), 35 (n = 3)
and 63 (n = 3)]. The average graft size increased until
day 35. At day 63, graft size was comparable to the size of
the original graft at day 0 (Fig. 3a). However, only grafts at
day 21 post grafting were statistically signiﬁcantly larger
(P \ 0.05) than those at grafting (day 0) and those at the
end of experiment period of 63 days. At the other time
points tumour volume variability was too large to reach
statistical signiﬁcance.

isolectin B4

To investigate changes in tumour volume, PNF-derived
tumour transplants were analyzed histologically at day 35
post grafting (Fig. 4). Tumour grafts,
like the original
tumours, consisted mostly of S100-positive cells (Fig. 4a).
Staining with mouse-speciﬁc
antibody
revealed newly formed blood vessels surrounding and
invading the grafts (Fig. 4b). Angiogenesis at the graft
periphery was conﬁrmed by FLK and VEGF expression in
the same area (not shown). Only a few cells in the S100-
positive graft were Ki67 positive, suggesting that Schwann
cell proliferation was slow. This is in concordance with the
low proliferation rate of PNF tumours in humans. In con-
trast, proliferating Ki67-positive cells were mostly present
in areas containing granulose tissue (Fig. 4 c, d) sur-
rounding the grafts (Fig. 4 e, f), where S100-positive cells
were only occasionally detected (Fig. 4g, h). In addition,
CD68-positive mouse macrophages were mainly found in
the granulose-containing periphery of the graft, but not
within the

differences are signiﬁcant at day 63, **P \ 0.01). Dotted lines mark

suggesting that the proliferating cells are not of human
tumour origin but rather inﬂammatory cells. Human-spe-
ciﬁc GST antibody did not stain cells in the granulose
tissue, supporting our interpretation that the inﬂammatory
cells are of mouse origin (Fig. 4h, insert). These results
suggest that the observed enlargement of the tumour grafts
in the ﬁrst 35 days post grafting is likely due to invasion of
murine proliferating inﬂammatory cells rather than human
tumour cell proliferation. The high variability of this
increase in volume is most
likely due to the variable
dynamics of the physiological inﬂammatory process.

schedule overlapped with the increase in tumour size due to
inﬂammation. Mice were sacriﬁced at day 63 post trans-
plantation, 28 days after treatment was discontinued, in
order to observe whether tumours would recur post treat-
ment (Fig. 3b). Initial sizes of grafts at grafting were

similar in the control and the treatment group (7.93 ±
3.45 mm3, n = 11 versus 8.428 ± 3.710 mm3, n = 8)
(non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, P [ 0.5). At the end
of the experiment at day 63, all eight PNF grafts in the
treatment group decreased in size by an average of

123

J Neurooncol (2010) 98:11–19

17

82 ± 18.1% (Fig. 3c). This decrease is signiﬁcant within
the group (post hoc analysis using Dunn’s test; P \ 0.001).
In contrast, only 4 out of 11 grafts in the control group
decreased in size (by an average of 66%), while 5 increased
in size and 2 remained unchanged (Fig. 3c). When all the
tumours in the 11 control mice were averaged, there was no
change in the graft size (0.4 ± 53%). At 63 days, graft
sizes in the treatment and the control group were signiﬁ-
cantly different (non-parametric repeated-measures one-
way ANOVA; P \ 0.001).

Since insufﬁcient nutritional supply may contribute to
shrinkage of the grafts, especially in larger grafts (in both
the control and treatment groups), we repeated the statis-
tical analysis with only grafts that were smaller than 9 mm3
at grafting (pieces of tumour larger than 9 mm3 had all
regressed in the control and treated groups), including six
mice from the treatment and seven from the control group.
The average reduction in graft size remained at 82 ± 8% in
the treatment group,
in comparison with a 45 ± 27%
increase in the control group (P \ 0.001, non-parametric
repeated-measures one-way ANOVA). Post hoc analysis
revealed that the size reduction within the treatment group
itself was also signiﬁcant (P [ 0.01).

Histological analysis of grafts at day 63 showed healthy
tumour tissue with mostly reduced inﬂammation in the
control group (Fig. 5a). In the treatment group, a large
inﬂammatory component was observed, which may be due
to diminished viability of the tumour cells at this time point
(Fig. 5b, c).

In order to assess whether imatinib mesylate inﬂuenced
mast cell inﬁltration, mast cell density was assessed in
grafts of both groups at the end of the experiment. No
difference in mast cell density was observed between the
control and the treatment groups: 34.64 ± 8.610/mm2
versus 64.12 ± 0.2991/mm2.

Discussion

We grafted fragments of human PNF tumours semi-or-
thotopically into injured sciatic nerve of nude mice and
found that the grafts persisted for at least 63 days without
signiﬁcant cell loss. The observed temporary increase in
size at about 21 days post grafting appeared to be due to
inﬁltration of Ki67-positive and S100-negative inﬂamma-
tory cells of murine origin. After inﬂammation ceased,
grafts reverted to their original size. According to our
recent observation using magnetic resonance imaging,
PNFs in patients do not grow, or grow only very slowly, in
most cases [3]. Detectable growth of PNF grafts in mice
within a period of 9 weeks clearly would not reﬂect the
authentic growth pattern of this kind of tumour in patients.
In contrast, lack of growth, as observed in this study, is the

tumour grafts larger than 9 mm3 decreased in size at the

partially due to necrosis as a result of insufﬁcient nutri-

Yang et al. [8] recently reported an effect of imatinib
mesylate for neuroﬁbromas in a transgenic mouse model
and speculated that the observed tumour inhibition was
via inhibition of NF1?/- mast cell inﬁltration. Here we
show that PNF and PNF-derived Schwann cells express
PDGFR-a and -b, both known targets of imatinib mes-
ylate. The observation that
imatinib mesylate indeed
reduces viability of PNF-derived Schwann cells in vitro
suggests a direct effect of the drug on the tumour cells.
Furthermore,
inhibition of neovascularization via the
PDGF signalling pathway may have also played a role in
the regression of these tumour grafts in mice. In recent
it has been shown that NF1?/- mice have

increased neointima formation and vessel lumen occlu-
sion in response to mechanical arterial injury; adminis-
tration of
imatinib mesylate to these mice prevented
neointima formation, suggesting that neointima formation
in NF1 is dependent on an imatinib mesylate-sensitive
pathway [16]. It is unlikely that imatinib mesylate acts
on mast cells via the c-Kit pathway in our model, as
only very few inﬁltrating mast cells were found in both
the control and the treated grafts. In addition, there was
no difference in mast cell inﬁltration between imatinib
mesylate
and the
inﬂammatory response follows similar patterns. Although
we have not looked at systemic effects of the drug, it is
unlikely that differences will be observed in immune-
compromised nude mice.

Our ﬁndings support further exploitation of the estab-
lished anti-cancer drug imatinib mesylate for treatment of
PNF. Additional studies should be carried out to further
clarify the mechanisms by which imatinib mesylate affects
PNF survival.
