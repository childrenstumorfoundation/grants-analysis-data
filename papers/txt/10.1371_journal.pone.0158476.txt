Abstract

Background
Everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy
in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) and other manifestations of
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, long-term use of mTOR inhibitors might be
necessary. This analysis explored long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus from the con-
clusion of the EXIST-1 study (NCT00789828).

Methods and Findings
EXIST-1 was an international, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial
examining everolimus in patients with new or growing TSC-related SEGA. After a double-
blind core phase, all remaining patients could receive everolimus in a long-term, open-label
extension. Everolimus was initiated at a dose (4.5 mg/m2/day) titrated to a target blood
trough of 5–15 ng/mL. SEGA response rate (primary end point) was defined as the propor-
tion of patients achieving confirmed 50% reduction in the sum volume of target SEGA
lesions from baseline in the absence of worsening nontarget SEGA lesions, new target

SEGA lesions, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. Of 111 patients (median age, 9.5
years) who received 1 dose of everolimus (median duration, 47.1 months), 57.7% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 47.9–67.0) achieved SEGA response. Of 41 patients with target
renal angiomyolipomas at baseline, 30 (73.2%) achieved renal angiomyolipoma response.
In 105 patients with 1 skin lesion at baseline, skin lesion response rate was 58.1%. Inci-
dence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable with that of previous reports, and occur-
rence of emergent AEs generally decreased over time. The most common AEs (30%
incidence) suspected to be treatment-related were stomatitis (43.2%) and mouth ulceration
(32.4%).

Conclusions
Everolimus use led to sustained reduction in tumor volume, and new responses were
observed for SEGA and renal angiomyolipoma from the blinded core phase of the study.
These findings support the hypothesis that everolimus can safely reverse multisystem man-
ifestations of TSC in a significant proportion of patients.

Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that occurs in approximately 1:6000
live births affecting approximately1 million people worldwide [1,2]. In TSC, the growth of
benign tumors in various organs occurs from loss of TSC1 or TSC2 genes and subsequent over-
activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase responsible for regulating cell
growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis [1,3,4].

Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are slow-growing tumors often found near
the foramen of Monro in the brains of patients with TSC [5–8]. SEGA growth can impede cere-
brospinal fluid flow in the ventricles, leading to acute hydrocephalus or death [4,7]. In the kid-
neys, renal angiomyolipomas, which are tumors composed of fat cells, immature smooth
muscle, and abnormal blood vessels, grow in number and size with age [9,10]. Larger angio-
myolipomas can develop aneurysms that can rupture and cause life-threatening hemorrhage
or encroach on normal renal tissue, leading to renal failure [7]. Skin lesions, such as hypomela-
notic macules, facial angiofibromas, and shagreen patches, can also be present at birth or
develop early in life in the majority of patients and can cause significant physical and psycho-
logical burden [11].

Everolimus has demonstrated efficacy in treating symptomatic, growing SEGAs in patients
with TSC, first in an open-label phase 1/2 trial in 28 patients with TSC-associated SEGA [12]
and subsequently in the double-blind phase in the large randomized, international, placebo-
controlled, phase 3 trial EXIST-1 [13]. Everolimus has also demonstrated significant reduction
in renal angiomyolipoma volume compared with placebo in the phase 3 EXIST-2 trial [14].
Consensus guidelines now include mTOR inhibitors as recommended treatment for asymp-
tomatic, growing SEGAs and renal angiomyolipomas [15–17]. In addition, mTOR inhibitors
have shown promise in treating multiple manifestations of TSC, including skin manifestations,

cardiac rhabdomyoma, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and epilepsy, which supports
the use of mTOR inhibitors as targeted multisystemic therapy for the disease [18,19].

There is some evidence that TSC-associated tumors regrow after cessation of mTOR inhibi-
tor treatment, suggesting that therapy with an mTOR inhibitor might necessitate long-term or
perhaps indefinite use [20]. Therefore, EXIST-1 included a long-term, open-label extension
phase to assess the efficacy and safety of everolimus over at least 4 years [13]. Interim results
from 111 patients treated with everolimus showed sustained SEGA reduction and acceptable
toxicity over approximately 2 years of treatment [21]. The EXIST-1 study concluded on Octo-
ber 2, 2014, and final results from approximately 4 years of treatment with everolimus in terms
of the primary efficacy end point (SEGA), as well as secondary (skin lesions), and exploratory
(renal angiomyolipoma) efficacy and safety end points, are presented in this article.

Methods
Study Design and Participants
The methodology of this study has been published previously [13,21]. This prospective, multi-
center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial included patients of any age with defini-
tive TSC per modified Gomez criteria [22,23] with 1 target SEGA lesion (1.0 cm in longest
diameter using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and radiological evidence of serial SEGA
growth, presence of a new SEGA lesion, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. The study was
initiated on August 20, 2009 (first patient randomly assigned) and follow-up continued until
October 2, 2014.

The study was reviewed by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board
for each center (see S1 Table for list of committees/review boards) and was conducted in com-
pliance with good clinical practice and under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or the patient’s guardian prior to
randomization. The protocol of this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as
supporting information (see S1 Protocol and S1 Checklist).

Procedures
In the core phase, patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either everolimus or placebo
until the last patient randomly assigned had been treated for 6 months [13]. After positive
results were observed in the double-blind core phase (database cutoff, March 2, 2011), the
study continued in a preplanned extension phase in which all patients remaining in the study
at the end of the core phase could receive open-label everolimus until the last patient randomly
assigned had been treated for 4 years.

Everolimus was initiated at a dose of 4.5 mg/m2/day based on body surface area and titrated

to blood trough concentrations of 5–15 ng/mL, with adjustments allowed based on toxicity.
Trough concentrations were monitored at each visit. Brain MRI and kidney computed tomog-
raphy /MRI (for patients with 1 target renal angiomyolipoma, 1.0 cm in longest diameter)
were performed at screening/baseline, at weeks 12, 24, and 48 after treatment initiation, and
annually thereafter. Physician’s global assessment (PGA) of skin lesions was performed every
12 weeks. Sexual maturation was assessed at screening/baseline and annually thereafter using
Tanner staging and developmental milestones. For patients aged <18 years at treatment initia-
tion, height and weight were measured at 24-week intervals before and after starting everoli-
mus. Patients who discontinued study medication received an end-of-study treatment
evaluation 28 days after their last everolimus dose.

End Points
The primary end point—SEGA response rate—represented the proportion of patients with
50% reduction in the sum volumes of all target SEGA lesions from baseline in the absence of
worsening nontarget or new target SEGA lesions and new or worsening hydrocephalus per
central radiology review. Secondary efficacy end points included time to SEGA response, time
to SEGA progression, and duration of SEGA response. SEGA progression was defined as an
increase in SEGA volume 25% from lowest value to a value greater than baseline or as
appearance of new SEGA lesions 1 cm in longest diameter, worsening of nontarget lesions,
or new or worsening hydrocephalus. The duration of SEGA response was defined as the dura-
tion between first SEGA response and the time of progression or last radiological assessment.
Renal angiomyolipoma response rate was an exploratory end point. This was defined as the
proportion of patients with 50% reduction in the sum volume of all target renal angiomyoli-
pomas compared with baseline in the absence of any new target renal angiomyolipomas, as
>20% increase in volume in either kidney from its lowest value, or as renal angiomyolipoma-
related bleed of grade 2 per central radiology review. Skin lesion response rate was defined as
the proportion of patients with either complete clinical response (100% improvement) or par-
tial response (50% improvement) in skin lesions according to the PGA per the investigator.
Skin lesion types included in the assessment were hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patches,
periungual or subungual fibroma, facial angiofibroma, and forehead plaques. Duration of skin
lesion response was defined as the time from the date of first skin lesion response until progres-
sion (worsening of the lesion by 25% compared with baseline), according to the PGA.

All responses required confirmation with a second scan (PGA for skin lesions) at least 8
weeks later. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.

Statistical Analysis
A detailed discussion of the methodology has been described previously [13,21]. The current
analyses included all patients who received 1 dose of everolimus. Descriptive statistics were
used to summarize baseline data at everolimus initiation. Changes of volume from baseline
with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for SEGA response and renal angio-
myolipoma response. The 95% CIs were also calculated for skin lesion response rate. Summary
statistics from the Kaplan-Meier curve determined median duration of SEGA response and
median time to SEGA progression, with statistics given as point estimates with 95% CI. Height
and weight were summarized using standard deviation scores (SDSs), taking into account the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Data from patients who dis-
continued the study prematurely were included in these analyses up until the time of their
discontinuation.

Results
Patients
Patient baseline characteristics have been reported previously [13,21]. Overall, 111 patients (33
originally assigned to receive placebo) received 1 dose of everolimus and were included in
this final analysis (Fig 1). The majority of patients (83.8%) were aged <18 years (Table 1). At
baseline (everolimus initiation), all patients (100%) had evidence of SEGA, 71 (64%) had renal
angiomyolipoma as a major feature (41 [36.9%] had 1 target renal angiomyolipoma), and
105 (94.6%) had 1 skin lesion. At the end of the study (October 2, 2014), median duration of

everolimus exposure was 47.1 months (range, 1.9–58.3); median dose intensity was 5.89 mg/
m2/day (range, 1.0–13.8).

SEGA-Related Results
At study completion, SEGA response had been achieved at any time by 64 patients, for a
response rate of 57.7% (95% CI, 47.9–67.0) per central radiology review. This is an increase in
best overall response from 34.6% in the primary analysis and 48.6% from an approximately
2-year interim analysis [13,21]. Median time to SEGA response was 5.32 months (95% CI,
3.02–5.59) and ranged from approximately 2.5 to 33.1 months. Although the majority of
responses were observed within the first months, some responses were observed/confirmed
more than 2.5 years into the study.
Median reduction from baseline in total SEGA volume increased slightly over time (Fig 2),
as did the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in SEGA volume over time (Fig 3).
The number of patients with values at week 240 was low (26 of 111); however, after 192 weeks
of treatment, 62% of patients (41 of 66) had 50% reduction in SEGA volume and 77% of
patients (51 of 66) had 30% reduction in SEGA volume.

Thirteen patients (11.7%) had SEGA progression at any time during the study. Only one of

these patients discontinued everolimus treatment because of SEGA progression. For six
patients, progression was detected at the end-of-treatment visit after everolimus had already
been discontinued for other reasons (completed treatment [n = 2], AE [n = 2] noncompliance

[n = 1], withdrew consent [n = 1]). In the other six patients, although progression was noted,
everolimus was continued at the discretion of the investigator. SEGA progression occurred
approximately 250 to 1700 days after everolimus initiation. Five of the 13 patients with pro-
gression had achieved response before progression. Duration of SEGA response for all
responders (duration between first SEGA response and the time of progression or last radiolog-
ical assessment) ranged from approximately 5.1 to 53.3 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of
duration of response at 48 months was 89.4% (95% CI, 76.2–95.5). Because of the low number
of SEGA progressions, median time to SEGA progression could not be determined. The pro-
gression-free survival rate at 3 years after treatment initiation was 88.8% (95% CI, 80.6–93.6).
No patient required surgery because of SEGA progression during the study.

Renal Angiomyolipoma Response
Of the 41 patients with 1 target renal angiomyolipoma at baseline, 30 patients achieved
response, for a response rate of 73.2% (95% CI, 57.1–85.8). This represents an improvement
from 53.3% (n = 16 of 30) in the everolimus arm at the time of the primary analysis [13]. The
median duration of renal angiomyolipoma response was 42.3 months (95% CI, 27.8–NA).
Renal angiomyolipoma volume continued to decrease over the study period (Fig 2); at week
192 (n = 19), median percentage reduction in the sum volume of target angiomyolipoma
lesions was 74.3%, with a median volume decrease from 14.65 cm3 at baseline to 4.35 cm3.

Nearly 95% of evaluable patients experienced a reduction in the sum volume of target angio-
myolipoma lesions as the best percentage change per central radiology review. More than 80%
of patients experienced reduction in renal angiomyolipoma volume of 50% at week 24, and
this degree of response continued over the study period (Fig 3). No new angiomyolipoma
lesions were observed, and no instance of grade 2 bleeding occurred.

Skin Lesion Response
In 105 patients with 1 skin lesion at baseline, the skin lesion response rate was 58.1% (61 of
105; 95% CI, 48.1–67.7), with nine patients (8.6%) experiencing complete clinical response and
52 (49.5%) experiencing partial response. This was improved from a partial response rate of
42% (30 of 72) and complete response rate of 0% reported among everolimus-treated patients
during the primary analysis of the study [13]. More than half the patients demonstrated a
response to treatment; nearly one-third reached complete or partial response as early as week
12, with responder rates increasing steadily through week 192 (Fig 3). Three of the 61 respond-
ers (4.9%) experienced progression of skin lesions, ranging from 2.3 to 55.5 months after the
response was first noted.

Safety
All but one patient (99.1%) experienced an AE during this long-term study. Emergence of indi-
vidual AEs was generally highest in the first year and decreased each subsequent year (Table 2).
The majority of patients (89.2%) experienced 1 AE that was suspected to be related to everoli-
mus. The most common AEs (by preferred term) suspected to be treatment-related in >10% of
patients were stomatitis (43.2%), mouth ulceration (32.4%), pneumonia (13.5%), blood choles-
terol level increase (11.7%), hypercholesterolemia (11.7%), nasopharyngitis (10.8%), and
pyrexia (10.8%). Among all patients, 36.0% experienced a grade 3 treatment-related AE. The
most common (>5%) events of this severity were stomatitis (10.8%), pneumonia (8.1%), and
neutropenia (5.4%). Only five patients (4.5%) experienced a treatment-related grade 4 AE,
which included neutropenia (2 patients, 1.8%), pneumonia, febrile infection, gastroenteritis,
and pneumothorax (1 patient each, 0.9%); febrile infection and gastroenteritis occurred in the
same patient. Most patients (n = 101 [91.0%]) required 1 dose interruption or reduction dur-
ing the study. The most common reason for dose interruption or reduction was an AE (n = 80
[72.1%]).

In total, 11 patients (9.9%) experienced an AE that led to discontinuation. These AEs

included Acinetobacter bacteremia, aggression, anemia, azoospermia, blood alkaline phospha-
tase level increase, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, need for neurosurgery, neutropenia,
pneumonia, pneumothorax, sinusitis, stomatitis, and viral infection (1 patient each, 0.9%).
Among these, viral infection, blood alkaline phosphatase level increase, and Acinetobacter bac-
teremia were all reported in the same patient. One patient experienced an AE that led to

discontinuation, but the investigator confirmed that the main reason for treatment discontinu-
ation was withdrawal of consent by the subject. One death (accidental asphyxiation) was
reported and was not suspected by the investigator to be treatment related.

Growth and Development and Sexual Maturation
More than half the patients were at Tanner stage 1 at baseline (34 of 64 male patients, 27 of 47
female patients for breast development, and 25 of 47 female patients for pubic hair). Over the
course of the study, normal progression in Tanner stage was usually seen. Median age to attain
Tanner stage 2 was 12.1 years for genitalia and 12.0 years for pubic hair in males (range, 9.5–
14.9) and 10.4 years for breast development and 11.0 years for pubic hair in females (range,
6.6–13.0).
rhea, seven (22.6%) experienced 1 amenorrhea episode. Three patients reported grade 3
amenorrhea; two were suspected to be related to study drug. None of these events led to study
discontinuation or necessitated dose adjustment.

Of the 93 patients aged <18 years at everolimus initiation with an evaluable height and

weight SDS at baseline, six (6.5%) and 13 (14.0%) reported notably low height and weight SDS
at baseline, respectively, and 16 (17.2%) and 15 (16.1%) reported notably high height and
weight SDS at baseline. These percentages did not increase over time after start of everolimus.

Discussion
The results from this final analysis of the long-term EXIST-1 study add to the compelling evi-
dence for the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with TSC-associated SEGA. The core
phase of this study showed the superiority of everolimus compared with placebo in terms of
SEGA response rate [13]; however, the core phase duration was inadequate to assess the long-
term implications of everolimus treatment in these patients. In this final analysis, SEGA
response rate increased to 58% over approximately 4 years of treatment, indicating that

patients who do not initially respond to everolimus might achieve response with continued
exposure. The proportion of patients with a clinically significant 50% reduction in SEGA vol-
ume generally increased over time, showing that clinically relevant SEGA reductions persisted.
The rate of SEGA progression was relatively low (~12%), and a number of patients continued
everolimus despite progression because they were attaining clinical benefit.

Evaluation of SEGA was the primary focus of this study. However, because TSC affects mul-

tiple organ systems, we also evaluated the effects of everolimus in patients with renal angio-
myolipoma and skin lesions. In this analysis, increasing and sustained reductions in renal
angiomyolipoma volume and improvement in skin lesions were observed, providing evidence
of broad clinical impact of systemic treatment with everolimus in patients with TSC. Although
the study was not adequately designed to fully assess effects in these manifestations, the positive
results are not entirely unexpected. The evidence examining use of oral mTOR inhibitors for
TSC has shown that the drug class has the potential for multisystemic effects in TSC not only
in treating SEGAs or renal angiomyolipomas, but also TSC-associated seizures, cardiac rhab-
domyoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, or some of the TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disor-
ders [18,19]. Additional studies in these areas are needed or are underway.

Everolimus proved to be safe and well tolerated over the long term. The pattern of AEs was

consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus. Although more than 80% of patients
experienced an AE suspected to be drug related during treatment, most AEs resolved without
any complication. Nearly three-quarters of the patients completed this long-term study as per
protocol, with only 10 patients (9.0%) discontinuing the study drug because of an AE.

The frequency of emerging AEs of all types decreased over time, with stomatitis and mouth
ulceration remaining the most common. Lack of data on the long-term effects of mTOR inhibi-
tors on growth and sexual maturation had represented an area of uncertainty, but clinical data
from this report do not indicate that these areas are impacted by use of everolimus. This is fur-
ther supported by data in pediatric transplant patients, in whom the use of everolimus for up
to 11 years was not associated with growth disturbances and did not impact sexual maturation
[24,25].

The goal of treatment with an mTOR inhibitor is to decrease or stabilize the size and num-

ber of tumors in patients with TSC [15,16,26]. In this long-term follow-up of patients with
growing SEGA at baseline, no patient required surgery because of SEGA progression while on
everolimus, and one patient elected to discontinue from the study to pursue surgery despite
having >50% reduction in SEGA volume. For one patient there was radiographic evidence of
hydrocephalus in the absence of SEGA growth and without clinical symptoms of progression.
None of the patients with renal angiomyolipoma experienced renal hemorrhage.
Similar to long-term phase 1/2 data, at least half the patients had SEGA volume reduction
50% at later time points (192 weeks [44 months] in this study and at 48 and 60 months in the
phase 1/2 study) [27]. In the core phase of the EXIST-1 study, 53% of patients receiving everoli-
mus had a renal angiomyolipoma response [13]. Comparatively, 42% of patients had a renal
angiomyolipoma response in the core phase of the similarly designed EXIST-2 study in adults
with TSC and renal angiomyolipoma [14]. In a longer term interim analysis from that trial, the
response rate had increased to 54% after median treatment duration of 28.9 months [28]. At
the conclusion of the current EXIST-1 study, approximately 73% of patients had experienced
renal angiomyolipoma response. Our study included fewer and younger patients with renal
angiomyolipoma, and it reports longer duration of everolimus exposure than what is currently
published for EXIST-2. A final long-term analysis of that study is forthcoming and might pro-
vide a better comparison.

Final 4-Year Results from the Clinical Trial, EXIST-1

Key safety results obtained during this long-term study remained consistent with those pre-
viously reported in TSC-associated clinical settings with everolimus [12–14,21,27–29]. No new
long-term safety issues arose from this analysis.

Important limitations of this analysis include the open-label design of the extension phase

and that the study was not powered or designed to adequately assess other secondary (skin
lesions) or exploratory (renal angiomyolipoma) clinical end points. At the end of the study, a
majority of patients had not yet completed their sexual development. Ongoing evaluation of
sexual development in a subset of these patients is being planned in a follow-up study.

Conclusions
Long-term efficacy and safety data from the completed EXIST-1 study confirm that everolimus
is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with TSC-associated SEGA. Moreover,
everolimus may reduce the risk for clinical complications of SEGA, such as hydrocephalus and
surgery, and use of everolimus effectively manages other TSC manifestations, such as angio-
myolipoma and skin lesions. Most AEs appeared in the first year of treatment and were man-
aged by dose adjustment/interruption, and no new safety concerns were raised through this
analysis. An upcoming final report on EXIST-2 will provide further assessment of the long-
term efficacy and safety of everolimus in treating TSC.
