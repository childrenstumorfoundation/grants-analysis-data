Germline mutations of the SMARCB1 gene predispose to two distinct tumor syndromes:
rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome, with malignant pediatric tumors mostly developing
in brain and kidney, and familial schwannomatosis, with adulthood benign tumors involving
cranial and peripheral nerves. The mechanisms by which SMARCB1 germline mutations
predispose to rhabdoid tumors versus schwannomas are still unknown. Here, to understand
the origin of these two types of SMARCB1-associated tumors, we generated different tissue-
and developmental stage-speciﬁc conditional knockout mice carrying Smarcb1 and/or Nf2
deletion. Smarcb1 loss in early neural crest was necessary to initiate tumorigenesis in the
cranial nerves and meninges with typical histological features and molecular proﬁles of
human rhabdoid tumors. By inducing Smarcb1 loss at later developmental stage in the
Schwann cell lineage, in addition to biallelic Nf2 gene inactivation, we generated the ﬁrst
mouse model developing schwannomas with the same underlying gene mutations found in
schwannomatosis patients.

Germline alterations of SMARCB1 gene predispose to two

different inherited tumor syndromes: rhabdoid tumor
predisposition syndrome (MIM 609322)1 and familial
schwannomatosis (MIM 162091)2. The ﬁrst genetic evidence
of the role of SMARCB1 as a tumor suppressor was the identi-
ﬁcation of its biallelic mutations as the cause of most cases of
malignant rhabdoid tumors (RTs)3, 4, a highly aggressive pedia-
tric cancer that usually occurs in the brain (named atypical
teratoid rhabdoid tumor: AT/RT), kidneys and soft tissues in
the ﬁrst years of life. Heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations are the
basis of the rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome3, 5. More
recently, SMARCB1 has been identiﬁed as a predisposing gene in
familial schwannomatosis6, a condition characterized by the onset
of multiple spinal, peripheral, and cranial-nerve schwannomas
during adulthood in the absence of vestibular schwannomas7.
Five percent of schwannomatosis patients also develop cranial or
spinal meningiomas8. SMARCB1 germline mutations have
been found in 45% of familial probands and 7% of sporadic
schwannomatosis patients9. Although the
exact molecular
pathogenetic mechanisms in these schwannomas remain to be
elucidated, a 4-hit/3-step mechanism involving SMARCB1 and
NF2 genes seems to underlie development of these benign tumors
in schwannomatosis patients10. Germline mutations in LZTR1,
a gene closely linked to NF2 and SMARCB1 on chromosome 22,
have recently been identiﬁed in a signiﬁcant proportion of
schwannomatosis patients lacking SMARCB1 germline muta-
tions. Similar
to SMARCB1-related schwannomas, different
additional somatic mutations in NF2 were identiﬁed in schwan-
nomas from these patients,
thus supporting the 4-hit/3-step
hypothesis11. This mechanism reinstates the crucial role of
biallelic NF2 loss in schwannoma genesis and of developmental
risk periods for SMARCB1 and NF2 mutations to occur. In
contrast, a single case of double SMARCB1/NF2 inactivation was
found in RTs12. Recent analysis of a larger series conﬁrmed
SMARCB1 as the primary tumor suppressor gene involved in the
development of rhabdoid tumors with no recurrent additional
oncogenic canonical pathway mutations identiﬁed13. This raises
challenging questions about the molecular mechanisms by which
germline mutations in the same gene predispose to early
aggressive RTs versus late-onset benign PNS tumors. Analysis of
the SMARCB1 gene mutation spectrum points to genotype-
phenotype correlations, with germline rhabdoid tumor mutations
being more centrally placed in the coding sequence, involving
multiple exons and truncating mutations of the SMARCB1 gene.
Conversely,
are mostly non
truncating mutations and located in hot spots at both 5′ and 3′
end of the SMARCB1 gene14. However, families with RTs or
multiple epitheloid schwannomas sharing the same SMARCB1
mutation have also been described15–17. A link between
schwannoma and RT has also been suggested by the histological
analysis of a series of aggressive PNS tumors revealing rhabdoid
features18–20, and sporadic case reports of RTs emanating from
cranial nerves21–23.

schwannomatosis mutations

Altogether, these observations raise the question of whether
the two types of SMARCB1-deﬁcient tumors arise from common
or different progenitor cells. In mice, the speciﬁc deletion of the
Nf2 gene in P0 permissive cells targets the cells of origin of
schwannomas in cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and nerve
roots24, 25. Although different hypotheses have been suggested, the
cell of origin of RTs remains unclear. Different studies using
histological and molecular markers or mouse models suggested
lineage26, neural
that RTs could arise from the mesenchymal
progenitor cells27, neural crest stem cells28–31, stem cells32, germ
and/or embryonic stem cells33. The homozygous inactivation of
Smarcb1 in mice leads to peri-implantation lethality and hetero-
zygous mice develop RTs at low penetrance (15–30%)29, 31, 34.

In two different Smarcb1+/−
mouse models, RTs developed
predominantly in the soft tissues of the head and neck29, 34. In
another Smarcb1+/−
model, 30% of the mice developed intra-
cranial tumors and 27% in the spinal cord around the dorsal
ganglia or spinal nerves that were classiﬁed as undifferentiated
sarcomas with variable rhabdoid features31. All three types of
Smarcb1+/−
mice presented an extended time window for tumor
onset with the earlier appearance at 3–4 months of age and
median onset at 11–12 months of age, depending on the model29,
31, 34. Conditional Smarcb1 inactivation in all tissues except
the brain led to 100% of mice developing T-cell
lymphoma
with 13% of mice developing RTs with a median latency
of 11 weeks after induction, demonstrating that inactivation of
the second Smarcb1 allele is rate limiting RT development in
Smarcb1+/−

mice35.

that

To investigate the role of Smarcb1 loss in PNS tumorigenesis,
we conditionally inactivated Smarcb1 in neural crest (NC) and
Schwann cell (SC) lineages. We report
tumors arising
from neural crest cells (NCCs) have histological and molecular
characteristics of human RTs, providing novel clues to their
cellular origin. Finally, we show that biallelic inactivation of
Smarcb1 and Nf2 in SCs results in benign schwannoma, and not
in RT, thus re-emphasizing the necessary and sufﬁcient role of
NF2 loss in SC tumorigenesis, in both neuroﬁbromatosis type 2
(NF2) and schwannomatosis, and the existence of a critical
developmental risk period for SMARCB1-deﬁcient RTs to occur.

Results
Smarcb1 loss in early NC promotes RT development. We tested
the hypothesis that Smarcb1 inactivation in NCCs and in the
SC lineage is sufﬁcient to initiate schwannoma development in
the mouse. Fifty percent of mice (3/6) carrying a germline
Smarcb1 deleted allele (Smarcb1del/+) developed tumors with
rhabdoid features occurring over a wide age range (2–17 months
of age). This observation is in line with the tumor phenotype
described in other mouse models of Smarcb1 inactivation29, 31, 34.
Tumors were located in the brain (emergence of trigeminal
nerve), spinal nerve roots and on the cheek and did not present
histological features of schwannoma. To circumvent the early
lethality of Smarcb1−/− mutants and malignant tumors found in
Smarcb1del/+ mice, we used a conditional ﬂoxed Smarcb1 allele
(Smarcb1ﬂox)36. To deﬁne the temporal window of susceptibility
to Smarcb1 loss, we used different promoters to induce Cre-
mediated Smarcb1 deletion at different stages of SC development.
To speciﬁcally direct Cre recombinase expression to the NCCs at
E9.5 and SC lineage we chose the promoter of the protein zero
(P0) gene, which efﬁciently targets schwannoma precursor cells24,
25.
P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice, harboring a homozygous deletion
of Smarcb1, were viable and obtained at the expected Mendelian
ratio (21.6 vs. 25%, non-statistically signiﬁcant difference,
Fig. 1a).

P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice presented with mild craniofacial
abnormalities: orbit malformations and misshapen mandibles,
with dental malocclusion eventually leading to outgrowing
teeth. Few mice displayed bloated intestines with histological
analysis revealing emaciated intestine wall associated with a
reduced number of villi. About 65% of P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice developed tumors between 1.5 and 5 months of age with
an overall median survival of 3.2 months (Fig. 1b). These
mice developed aggressive cranial nerve tumors: olfactory
(91%, Fig. 1c, f, g), trigeminal (51%, Fig. 1i), oculomotor and
optic (37%, Fig. 1m), or vestibulocochlear (14%, Fig. 1k, l) nerves
were the most affected. Tumors were also found in the meninges
with variable extent of brain invasion (14%, Fig. 2a, b), in spinal

P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox tumors display human RT features.
Tumors of P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice displayed a histologic
spectrum ranging from a primitive neuroectodermal (Fig. 3a),
to a mesenchymal (Fig. 3b) or rhabdoid pattern (Fig. 3c). No
epithelial differentiation was observed. Most tumor cells exhibited
atypical
irregular and
thick membrane, and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3b inset). Some of
these cells showed an eccentric nucleus associated with a
prominent eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion (Fig. 3c and inset)
or cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration (Fig. 3d and inset), typical
histological features encountered in human AT/RTs37. Rhabdoid
features or scattered rhabdoid cells were found in all analyzed
tumors, and in 30% of these, nests of rhabdoid cells were present
(Fig. 3c). Bi-nucleated and giant multinucleated cells were also
found in some tumors. Tumors displayed different patterns
depending on their size at the time of dissection. Larger tumors
typically presented more rhabdoid features than smaller tumors.
All the tumors examined demonstrated loss of SMARCB1 nuclear
expression by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 3e). However,
similar to human RTs38, inﬁltrating inﬂammatory and endothe-
lial cells retained SMARCB1 staining (Fig. 3e). The tumors
behaved in an aggressive manner, displaying rapid growth,

with high percentages of Ki-67-positive cells (50.7 ± 3.7% in
neuroectodermal and 33.4 ± 3.9% in mesenchymal histological
subtypes) (Fig. 3f). Larger tumors frequently showed areas of
necrosis. Some tumors were contained within the boundaries of
the tissue of origin, such as the epineurium of the trigeminal
nerve (Fig. 1i), while other tumors, such as those extending in the
cochlea from the vestibulocochlear nerve, were more invasive,

tumors

Because of their heterogeneous histologic features, RTs usually
show a broad spectrum of immunohistochemical reactivity40.
With a remarkable similarity to human RTs37, tumors from
P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice typically showed a consistent
expression of vimentin (Fig. 3g), a moderate to strong SMA
staining (Fig. 3h), whereas staining for cytokeratin proteins or
neuroﬁlament triplet proteins, commonly found in foci of human
AT/RTs, was not detected (Fig. 3i, j). Staining of S100 protein,
a marker of schwannoma41, allowed to clearly distinguish the
P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mouse
from schwannomas:
from P0-CreC;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, which
unlike schwannomas
strongly and diffusely express S100 protein (Fig. 3k), tumor cells
from P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice showed no S100 protein by
IHC (Fig. 3l). Modest GFAP expression was present in P0-CreC;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox tumors (Fig. 3m) whereas P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
tumors showed little GFAP expression in few reactive astrocytes
(Fig. 3n). However, tumors from both P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
and P0-CreC;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice displayed a strong staining for
FABP7 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7) (Fig. 3o, p), an early
marker of SC precursors42. Altogether, P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
mouse tumors displayed typical histological and immunohisto-
chemical features of human RTs, clearly distinguishable from

representative RTs by whole-genome RNA sequencing. Unsu-
pervised hierarchical clustering of the top 5000 most variable
transcripts in P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox RTs identiﬁed three mole-

their anatomical origin (Fig. 4a). Thus, tumors from P0-CreC;

using the R package. WGCNA allowed identiﬁcation, within
the highest positively correlated module with each molecular
subgroup, of several representative marker genes that were
signiﬁcantly and consistently overexpressed in both human and
mouse RT molecular subgroups (Fig. 4c). Speciﬁcally, TRPM3
(Transient Receptor Potential cation channel
subfamily M
member 3), a membrane channel that can promote renal cell
tumors45, was found consistently overexpressed in the human
hTYR and mouse mRT-Tyr molecular subgroups (Fig. 4c).

were consistently overexpressed in mouse and human SHH and
MYC molecular subgroups, respectively (Fig. 4c). TYR, MYCN,
and HOTAIR, marker genes of the three human subgroups43
showed a similar trend of overexpression in the respective mouse
RT subgroups, albeit not statistically signiﬁcant likely due to the
small number of mouse tumors analyzed (Fig. 4c).

As in human AT/RTs48, Smarcb1 deﬁciency in all P0-CreC;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox RT subgroups was correlated with an increased
expression of the polycomb gene Ezh2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b), a
key driver of oncogenesis49. Analysis of molecular pathways in P0-
CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox RTs by western blot
showed increased
phosphorylation of Akt, S6, and 4E-BP1, consistent with activation
of the mTOR/Akt pathway, similar to schwannomas in P0-CreC;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Cell cycle proteins (CDK4,
CDK6, cyclin D1, p16) were overexpressed in all P0-CreC;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox tumors and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
protein was found in 3 out of 5 RTs (Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Activation of these pathways has been reported in human RTs50.

(nBAF) (Fig. 4d). These results, except for SS18L1 (CREST), were
consistent with subunit gene expression in the series of human
AT/RTs from Johann et al. (Fig. 4e) and demonstrated that
the residual SWI/SNF complex in Smarcb1-deﬁcient RTs is
characteristic of undifferentiated progenitor cells51, pointing to an
early developmental cell population of origin for RTs. Analysis of
gene regulatory networks underlying formation of NCCs showed
robust expression of genes exclusively expressed in the neural plate
border and NC speciﬁcation modules52
in both P0-CreC;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox and human RT samples (Fig. 4f, g). The fact
that human AT/RTs and RTs from P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
mice retain speciﬁc marker genes of early NC formation, strongly
corroborates the hypothesis of an early NCC as their cell of origin.

SC differentiation suppresses Smarcb1-driven tumorigenicity.
The existence of adult carriers of a SMARCB1 mutation without
RT in families presenting either RTs or schwannomas suggests
the existence of a speciﬁc developmental time window during
which RT progenitor cells are vulnerable to SMARCB1 loss15–17.
To assess if loss of Smarcb1 at a later stage of development would
induce tumorigenesis, we bred Smarcb1ﬂox mice with DHH-Cre
and mGFAP-Cre transgenic mice that express the Cre recombi-
nase at later stages of SC development. DHH-Cre transgenic
mice53 express Cre in SC precursors beginning at embryonic day
E12.542. DHH-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice had an overall median
survival of 3 weeks and displayed progressive hindlimb paralysis.
The sciatic nerves were thinner and more transparent than in
control littermates. Histological analysis demonstrated that loss
of Smarcb1 (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d) led to a lack of structure
and organization of the nerve ﬁbers (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b)
with increased numbers of BrdU and Ki-67 positive cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5e–h). No tumors were found in cranial
nerves, peripheral nerves, or dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of
DHH-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice during their short lifespan.

To

target

SCs, we

immature

the CNS and postnatal astroglial cells

generated mGFAP-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice using the mGFAP-Cre transgenic mice that
express the Cre recombinase under the promoter of the mouse
GFAP gene54. This promoter targets immature SCs in the
peripheral nervous system starting at E13.554, postnatal astrocytes
throughout
in the
cerebellum55. X-gal staining of tissues from mGFAP-Cre;ACZL
mice demonstrated expression of Cre recombinase in spinal
nerve root SCs
(Supplementary Fig. 6d), spinal cord and
throughout the brain (Supplementary Fig. 6c). At three months of
age, mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox and mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1del/ﬂox
mice started developing cataracts, displayed progressive ataxia
with loss of motor coordination and gait balance, eventually
leading to loss of bodyweight and euthanasia. This neurological

phenotype was similar to the one described at earlier age
in hGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox56 and hGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox44 mice. The median survival of mGFAP-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox and mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1del/ﬂox mice was 3.7
and 3.8 months of age (P = 0.74, non-statistically signiﬁcant
difference, Supplementary Fig. 6b), respectively. Histological
analysis of the brain revealed atrophy of the cerebellum, but
no tumors were found in the brain, cranial nerves or DRGs
(Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). No change in cellularity was found in
the DRGs of mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice compared with
control littermates (Fig. 5a, b, g).

In conclusion, the observation that DHH-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
and mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice did not develop RTs
allowed us to narrow down to early NC development the time
window for Smarcb1 loss to promote malignant tumorigenesis.

Smarcb1 and Nf2 loss in SCs promotes schwannoma develop-
ment. The observation of frequent somatic, tumor-speciﬁc NF2
mutations, and the loss of the second NF2 allele in schwannomas
from patients with germline SMARCB1 mutations10, 57–59
strongly suggest that the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis
does not pertain in the tumors of schwannomatosis patients, as it
would require biallelic SMARCB1 inactivation to be sufﬁcient for
tumor initiation or growth7. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that
NF2 loss is necessary for schwannoma formation in schwanno-
matosis patients with germline SMARCB1 mutations.

To model the different steps leading to the double SMARCB1/
NF2 gene loss, we generated combinatorial Smarcb1 and Nf2
wild-type or mutant alleles, representative of the 4-hit/3-step
model. P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice were not viable,
demonstrating that loss of both Smarcb1 and Nf2 during early
development is lethal. However, in mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;
Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, combination of Smarcb1 and Nf2 inactivation
resulted in viable mice, with a median survival of 6.4 months of
age. The statistically signiﬁcant longer survival is due to the fact
that these mice do not develop the rapidly growing RTs inevitably
causing death in P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice. Cre is expressed
in the DRGs of mGFAP-Cre mice starting at E13.554. The
mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice developed tumorlets
consisting of whorls of SCs in the DRGs (Fig. 5e). These DRG
lesions are similar to those described in the P0-CreC;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox25
and mGFAP-Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice, and are reminiscent of the
thus
schwannoma
demonstrating the necessary role of Nf2 loss for schwannoma
formation. Schwannoma tumorlets in the DRGs of mGFAP-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice were negative for SMARCB1 and
merlin staining, about 60% were positive for S100 protein
staining, and all were positive for GFAP and FABP7 (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Patients with germline mutations of the SMARCB1 gene are
predisposed to develop RTs or
two tumor
features. However,
types with dramatically different clinical

schwannomas,

aggressive PNS

the presence of
tumors with rhabdoid
features suggests a link between the development of RTs and
schwannomas20. We used the P0-CreC mouse line, known to
express the Cre recombinase in NCCs, to target the precursors
of the SC lineage and the schwannoma cells of origin42 (Fig. 7).
The early onset and high penetrance of RTs in P0-CreC;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice demonstrated that loss of Smarcb1 in early
NC (E9.5) is necessary for RT tumorigenesis (Fig. 7). This result is
consistent with the high penetrance of AT/RTs in Rosa26-
CreERT2;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice injected with tamoxifen between
E6 and E1030. Although the Rosa26-CreERT2 model doesn’t
target Smarcb1 deletion in a speciﬁc cell type, expression proﬁling
suggests that the cell of origin could be ectomesenchyme, a
cephalic NCC-derived mesoderm or neural progenitors depend-
ing of the tumor subtype30. Inactivation of Smarcb1 at later stages
of SC development failed to initiate tumorigenesis in DHH-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox and mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice suggesting
that Smarcb1 loss is not
tumorigenic in the peripheral SC
lineage or in the brain glial cells when the deletion is induced after
E12.5 or E13.5, respectively (Fig. 7); or that the neurological
deﬁcits were lethal before the mice developed tumors. This
result is consistent with other studies demonstrating that single
loss of Smarcb1 in hGFAP-positive neural precursors is not
tumorigenic44, 56 and that additional loss of Trp53 is required to
in hGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;
induce AT/RT development
Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox mice44. The use of different Cre drivers allowed us
to narrow down the temporal window during which Smarcb1 loss
is
tumorigenic. The existence of a speciﬁc developmental
time window could also explain the presence of RTs and
schwannomatosis within a family sharing the same SMARCB1
mutation15–17. The neurological deﬁcits developed by DHH-
CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox, mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox and mGFAP-
Cre;Smarcb1del/ﬂox mice with late Smarcb1 inactivation also point
to a role of Smarcb1 in nervous system development, which could

mGFAP-Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice. DRGs from mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice present loss of SMARCB1 nuclear staining (white arrows), but no tumorlets or
increased Ki-67 immunopositive staining. Tumorlets in DRGs of mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice show loss of both SMARCB1 and merlin (white
and black arrows), and tumorlets in DRGs of mGFAP-Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice show loss of merlin only (black arrows). Both tumorlets from mGFAP-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox and mGFAP-Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice show strong positive staining for FABP7 and GFAP (black arrows). Tumorlets from these both
genotypes are S100 positive (black arrows) or negative (white arrows). Ki-67 positive staining is found in tumorlets of both mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;

underlie the neurological deﬁcits found in the SMARCB1-related
human Cofﬁn–Siris syndrome61.

The fact that most of the tumors were found in the head of P0-
CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice is consistent with early Cre expression
under the control of the P0 promoter in cranial NCCs and the
prominent expression of Smarcb1 between E8 and E11.5 during
the embryonic development of the headfolds, neural folds and
ﬁrst brachial arch34. P0 was originally identiﬁed as a SC-speciﬁc
myelin structural protein, but was more recently found expressed
by migrating NCCs in the head of E10.5 mouse embryos62, as well
as in the otic placode and migrating cranial NCCs of E10 rat
embryos. After E11, P0 can be detected in the ophthalmic and
submandibular branches of the trigeminal nerves, within the
trigeminal ganglion and in the developing acoustic/facial nerves
of rat embryos. The P0-CreC transgene used in this study is
expressed in the head of mouse embryos as early as E9.525. The
early
presence of

craniofacial abnormalities

conﬁrms

the

inactivation of Smarcb1 in the cranial NC, which is at the
origin of multiple head structures such as bones and cartilages,
SCs, olfactory ensheathing cells and meninges. The high
frequency of tumors originating in the olfactory nerve is likely
due to the fact that olfactory ensheathing cells, as opposed to the
non-myelinating SCs of the trunk, do not down regulate P0
expression. Therefore, the promoter driving the Cre recombinase
is continuously activated in the olfactory ensheathing cells of
P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice. Activity of the P0-Cre transgene
has also been demonstrated in the enteric ganglia63,
thus
explaining the presence of bloated intestine resulting from defects
of the enteric nervous system, which is derived from vagal
and sacral NCCs. The presence of RTs in the subarachnoid space,
in the rostral part of the cortex is consistent with the hypothesis
that
these tumors developed from the cranial NC-derived
meningeal progenitor cells39. Although in patients AT/RTs
are predominantly infratentorial, they can also develop in the

Fig. 7 Proposed model of schwannoma versus RT initiation in the NC-derived SC lineage. Schematic illustration of the different combinations of mouse
genotypes modeling different steps of the human 4-hit/3-step mechanism sequence and corresponding tumor phenotypes. a Smarcb1 loss in early NC
results in RT development in P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice, but is not tumorigenic when occurring at later SC developmental stages (DHH-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox
and mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice). Thus, loss of Smarcb1 does not contribute to schwannoma development in mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice

supratentorial region of the brain with frequent connection to the
ventricles64. Human RTs have also been described in the
meninges65. The early NC origin of P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox RTs
is also supported by expression of early NC speciﬁcation markers
and SWI-SNF subunits characteristic of undifferentiated cells.
Altogether, these results strongly support the hypothesis that both
PNS and meningeal RTs originate from NCCs.

Tumors found in P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice displayed
histological features strikingly similar to human RTs, including
aggressive
patterns
and presence of rhabdoid cells40. The anatomical locations of
RTs in P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice have all been described
in human RT patients: optic22, oculomotor66,
trigeminal21,
vestibulochochlear23 nerves, eye67, nasal cavities68, meninges65
and spine69. About 60% of P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox mice
displayed multiple tumors at the time of dissection, which is
consistent with the occurrence of synchronous RTs in some
patients with SMARCB1 mutations66. Finally, molecular proﬁling
showed that P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox RTs represented the full
spectrum of human AT/RT molecular subtypes43.

Although in mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice loss
of Smarcb1 and Nf2 is synchronous and not sequential as
postulated by the 4-hit/3-step model, this is the ﬁrst tumor model
reproducing
schwannomatosis-
schwannomas with concomitant loss of both Smarcb1 and Nf2
genes, with schwannoma and no RT development (Fig. 7). The
mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mouse model demon-
strates that biallelic loss of Smarcb1 loss is dispensable and Nf2
loss is necessary for schwannoma development41, as in mGFAP-
Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox mice. This is consistent with the presence of NF2
somatic mutations in the vast majority of schwannomas in
schwannomatosis patients10, 11. Similar to schwannomatosis
patients, loss of both Smarcb1 and Nf2 does not increase the
malignancy of mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox
tumors

compared to mGFAP-Cre;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox tumors with single Nf2 loss.
In contrast to NF2, schwannomas in schwannomatosis patients
are typically distinctly painful, rather than manifesting with
localized neurologic deﬁcits2. Thus, Smarcb1 inactivation could
be responsible for the pain phenotype, as suggested by a report
showing that loss of Smarcb1 in adult mouse SC induces the
expression of a secreted factor that in turn increases TRPV1
expression and thermal sensitivity70.

In conclusion, we found that biallelic inactivation of Smarcb1
in the NC leads to the development of PNS and meningeal RTs,
thus identifying the cell of origin for these RT subsets in an early
NC population. We also deﬁned an early spatio-temporal window
during which Smarcb1 loss results in malignant tumor formation
and showed that biallelic Nf2 loss is necessary and Smarcb1 loss
is dispensable
formation. This mouse
model developing schwannomas with the same underlying gene
mutations
found in schwannomatosis patients will prove
invaluable for the study of other schwannomatosis-associated
phenotypes, such as neuropathic pain.

Methods
Mice and genotyping. All mouse strains were maintained on FVB/N genetic
background. Mice were monitored twice a week for 24 months or until a tumor or
evidence of a tumor (paralysis, swelling, lethargy) was observed. All animal care
and experimentation were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees under protocol number HE1175-10-02. Smarcb1del/+
mice were obtained by breeding mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1ﬂox/+ males (expressing Cre
in the germline, http://www.jax.org/strain/024098) with wild-type FVB females.
mGFAP-Cre;Smarcb1del/ﬂox mice were obtained by breeding mGFAP-Cre;
Smarcb1ﬂox/+ males with Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox females. Mice were genotyped by PCR
ampliﬁcation of DNA extracted from tail biopsies using the primers cre-s1
(5′-ACA TGT TCA GGG ATC GCC AG-3′) and cre-a1 (5′-TAA CCA GTG AAA
CAG CAT TGC-3′) for the Cre transgene, 407Fbis (5′-GGA AAA TCT AGA AAG
CAC AAA TGA-3′) and 408R (5′-TGT AGT CTA GGC TGG GTG TG-3′) for the
Smarcb1WT and Smarcb1ﬂox alleles, 407Fbis and 416rbis (5′-CCT GGG GCA GCT

and Z2 (5′-TGT GAG CGA GTA ACA ACC-3′) for the AZCL transgene.

Magnetic resonance imaging. Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane throughout
the imaging procedure. Mice were inserted in the prone position into a small
animal MRI scanner (PharmaScan 300; Bruker BioSpin Division, Billerica, MA,
USA) 7 Tesla magnet using the 19-mm inner diameter transmit receive coil.
ParaVision 4.0 scanner software (BRUKER BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany) was set to use Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE)
spin echo sequence for fast T2-weighted imaging (TE 50, TR 3000, RARE Factor 8)
with a 256 × 256 in-plane matrix and a 2.56-cm ﬁeld of view. After scanning,
if needed, mice were gently warmed on a thermostatically controlled heating
pad until awake enough to be returned to their home cage. MRI images were
reconstructed at native resolution and analyzed with OsiriX (Open-Source
Software for Navigating in Multidimensional DICOM Images) image analysis
software packages.

H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, X-gal staining and cell counting.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on 3.5-µm-thick sections prepared
from parafﬁn blocks of formalin-ﬁxed tissues. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on 9 P0-CreC;Smarcb1ﬂox/ﬂox representative tumors (3 tumors per
histological pattern) and 7 representative schwannomas from P0-CreC;Nf2ﬂox/ﬂox
mice (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). A standard protocol was used with
primary antibodies incubated 1 h at room temperature: cytokeratin (1/500, Dako,
M3515), FABP7 (1/1000, Abcam, ab32423), GFAP (1/3000, Dako, Z0334), Ki-67
(1/1000, BD Pharmingen, 556003), merlin (1/400, Cell Signaling Technology,
#6995), neuroﬁlament triplet proteins (1/500, Enzo Life Sciences, BML-NA1223),
PGDS (1/1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-14826), S100 (1/10000, Dako, Z0311),
SMA (1/200, BioCare Medical, CME 305), SMARCB1 (1/200, BD Transduction
Laboratories, 612110), vimentin (1/200, Cell Signaling Technology, #5741). Bioti-
nylated secondary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
or anti-goat (Dako) IgG antibodies were incubated 30 min at room temperature.
Immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively scored based on the percentage of
positive tumor cells (few, foci or majority of positive cells) and the intensity of
staining (weak, moderate or strong).

To assess cell proliferation, bromodeoxyuridine (50 mg/kg body weight)

was administrated 4 h before dissection of the tissues. Incorporation of BrdU
was then revealed by immunohistochemistry with BrdU antibody (Fitzgerald
Industries International, 20-BS17) and secondary anti-sheep antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA).

For X-gal staining, tissues were frozen in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, 4583)

on dry ice. Frozen sections of 10 µm were ﬁxed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2%
glutaraldehyde in 1X PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed tissues were
washed three times in 1X PBS, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in the staining
solution (5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], 5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6], 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mg/ml X-gal
in PBS). After staining, tissues were washed twice in 1× PBS and counterstained
with Nuclear Fast Red for 1–2 min.

For DRG cell count, 5–12 DRGs of the cervical and/or thoracic spine were
selected from 3–5 mice per genotype using a light microscope Axio Imager M1
(Zeiss). The region of interest (ROI) containing ganglion cells was manually
demarcated on captured images of 20× magniﬁcation ﬁelds. The Axiovision
software was used to determine the surface and the cells count in the ROI. All
histopathological analysis was performed in blind under the guidance of an
experienced pathologist.

PCR. PCR ampliﬁcation was performed on DNA extracted from multiple tissues
using the primers cre-s1 and cre-a1 for the Cre transgene, 407Fbis and 408R for the
Smarcb1WT and Smarcb1ﬂox alleles, 407Fbis, 408R, and 416R (5′-GCC ACC AGC
CAG ATG TCA TAC-3′) for the Smarcb1ﬂox and Smarcb1del alleles in the tumors,
Ini1DelAf (5′-AAG CAC AAA TGA GAG AAA ACG TA-3′) and Ini1DelBr
(5′-TGC CAC CAG CCA GAT GTC A-3′) with Hotmaster Taq DNA polymerase
for the Smarcb1del allele in the PCR for all the tissues.

RNA-Seq and bioinformatics. RNA was isolated using the RiboPure kit
(Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA Libraries were
prepared using the TruSeq Stranded library preparation kit (Illumina) RNA after
RiboZero treatment for removal of ribosomal RNAs. After library preparation,
ampliﬁed double-stranded cDNA was fragmented into 125 bp (Covaris-S2,
Woburn, MA) DNA fragments, which were (200 ng) end-repaired to generate
blunt ends with 5′- phosphates and 3′- hydroxyls and adapters ligated. The puriﬁed
cDNA library products were evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Rosa,
CA) and diluted to 10 nM for cluster generation in situ on the HiSeq paired-end
ﬂow cell using the CBot automated cluster generation system. All samples were
multiplexed into a single pool in order to avoid batch effects and sequenced using
an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) yielding between 52
and 90 million reads per sample. Quality control was performed on base qualities
and nucleotide composition of sequences. Alignment to the M. musculus (mm10)
refSeq (refFlat) reference gene annotation was performed using the STAR spliced

ARTICLE

read aligner with default parameters. Additional QC was performed after the
alignment to examine: the level of mismatch rate, mapping rate to the whole
genome, repeats, chromosomes, key transcriptomic regions (exons, introns, UTRs,
genes), insert sizes, AT/GC dropout, transcript coverage and GC bias. Between 80
and 85% (average 83%) of the reads mapped uniquely to the mouse genome and
only uniquely mapped reads were used for subsequent analyses. Total counts of
read-fragments aligned to candidate gene regions were derived using HTSeq
program (version 0.6.0, www.huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.
html) with mouse mm10 refSeq (refFlat table) as a reference and used as a basis for
the quantiﬁcation of gene expression.

Microarray data from Johann et al.43 (GSE70678), Han et al.30 (GSE64019) and

Ng et al.44 (GSE68627) was downloaded from GEO and normalized using the
robust multiarray method (RMA). Gene symbols were used to match human and
mouse transcripts and merge expression datasets after averaging multiple probes
querying the same gene. Batch effects were corrected using ComBat and overall
quantile normalization was performed across data sets.

Hierarchical clustering of the top most variable genes (as ranked by s.d.)
was performed using the plotDendroAndColors function from the WGCNA
package. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was
conducted using the R package. Brieﬂy, correlation coefﬁcients were constructed
between expression levels of genes, and a connectivity measure (topological
overlap, TO) was calculated for each gene by summing the connection strength
with other genes. Genes were then clustered based on their TO, and groups of co-
expressed genes (modules) were identiﬁed. Each module was assigned a color, and
the ﬁrst principal component (eigengene) of a module was extracted from the
module and considered to be representative of the gene expression proﬁles in a
module. The phenotypic trait of interest is then regressed on the eigengene to
examine whether there was a signiﬁcant relationship between the module and the
trait.

The optimal number of clusters was determined using the non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) method with the NMF R package, based on the top 5000 most
variable genes with standard NMF algorithm method (brunet) performed on 10
runs. The optimal numbers of clusters have been deﬁned based on the maximum
cophenetic correlation score.

Quantitative RT-PCR. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 µg of the
same RNA samples used for RNA-Seq and the SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix
(Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression
levels were assessed by quantitative PCR using a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan gene expression assays: Smarcb1
(Mm00448776_m1), Ezh2 (Mm00468464_m1) and Hprt (Mm00446968_m1, Life
Technologies). Relative expression was determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method with
Hprt expression as reference and normalized to a brain control sample.

Western blot. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
Pulverized frozen tumor samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer and the total proteins were extracted, separated, and transferred
using standard procedures. Antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction
Laboratories: SMARCB1 (1/500, 612110); Cell Signaling Technology: Akt (1/2000,
#9272), P-Akt (Ser473) (1/2000, #4060), CDK4 (1/2000, #2906), CDK6 (1/2000,
#3136), Cyclin D1 (1/3000, #2926), merlin (1/1000, #6995), p27 (1/1000, #2552),

sc-1207) and Thermo Scientiﬁc: p21WAF1 (1/1000, MS-387-P0). All uncropped
scans of western blots are provided in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA) was used to perform statistical analysis and construct
Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Mendelian birth incidence of mouse genotypes was
examined using chi-square test. Differences in survival of mouse genotypes were
analyzed by log-rank Mantel–Cox test. Two-tailed Student’s unpaired t-test was
used to determine signiﬁcance between groups unless otherwise indicated. The
variance between the groups was not signiﬁcantly different (F test). A P value of
< 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Results of the signiﬁcance tests
are reported as follow: ns (non signiﬁcant), *(P < 0.05), **(P < 0.01) and
***(P < 0.001). Error bars represent s.e.m.
