ABSTRACT: Legius syndrome presents as a mild neuroﬁ-
bromatosis type 1 (NF1) phenotype. Multiple caf´e-au-lait
spots and macrocephaly are present with or without ax-
illary or inguinal freckling. Other typical NF1-associated
features (Lisch nodules, bone abnormalities, neuroﬁbro-
mas, optic pathway gliomas, and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors) are systematically absent. Legius
syndrome is caused by germline loss-of-function SPRED1
mutations, resulting in overactivation of the RAS–MAPK
signal transduction cascade. The ﬁrst families were identi-
ﬁed in 2007. Here, we review all identiﬁed SPRED1 mu-
tations and summarize molecular, clinical, and functional
data. All mutations have been deposited in a database
created using the Leiden Open Variation Database soft-
ware and accessible at http://www.lovd.nl/SPRED1. At
present, the database contains 89 different mutations iden-
tiﬁed in 146 unrelated probands, including 16 new vari-
ants described for the ﬁrst time. The database contains
a spectrum of mutations: 29 missense, 28 frameshift,
19 nonsense, eight copy number changes, two splicing,
one silent, one in-frame deletion and a mutation affecting
the initiation codon. Sixty-three mutations and deletions
are deﬁnitely pathogenic or most likely pathogenic, eight
SPRED1 mutations are probably benign rare variants, and
17 SPRED1 missense mutations are still unclassiﬁed and
need further family and functional studies to help with the
interpretation.

Background

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM# 162200) or von Reckling-
hausen’s disease is a common autosomal dominant disorder affect-
ing one in 3,000 live births worldwide [Huson et al., 1989]. Typical
clinical manifestations include the presence of multiple caf´e-au-lait
spots, skin fold freckling, Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas,
and neuroﬁbromas. Other features associated with NF1 are short
stature, macrocephaly, scoliosis and speciﬁc bone abnormalities,
learning disabilities, and an increased risk for speciﬁc malignancies
[Brems et al., 2009]. Diagnostic criteria for NF1 were established
at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development
Conference [Stumpf et al., 1988] and patients must fulﬁll two or
more of the following features: six or more caf´e-au-lait spots (>5 mm
in diameter in children, >15 mm in postpubertal individuals), two
or more (sub)cutaneous neuroﬁbromas or one plexiform neuroﬁ-
broma, axillary or inguinal freckling, optic pathway glioma, two
or more Lisch nodules, typical bone dysplasia, ﬁrst-degree relative
with NF1. Inactivating mutations in the NF1 gene were identiﬁed
in patients with NF1. The NF1 gene codes for neuroﬁbromin, a
protein with rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog–GTPase activat-
ing protein (RAS–GAP) activity, which negatively regulates RAS
[Cichowski and Jacks, 2001]. NF1 was the ﬁrst gene linked to the
RAS–MAPK pathway [Viskochil et al., 1990; Wallace et al., 1990].
More recently, germline mutations in other genes coding for pro-
teins involved in the RAS–MAPK pathway were identiﬁed in several
human genetic syndromes [Zenker, 2011].

Some of these syndromes have an overlapping phenotype, al-
though there are always unique phenotypic characteristics. The
RASopathies, or syndromes of the RAS–MAPK pathway identiﬁed
so far are as follows: Noonan, cardio-facio-cutaneous, LEOPARD,
Costello, capillary malformation–arteriovenous malformation, CBL
mutation-associated syndrome, and hereditary gingival ﬁbromato-
sis. Even multiple genes were identiﬁed for some of these syndromes.
In 2007, our research group identiﬁed a new RASopathy in patients
with a mild NF1-like phenotype [Brems et al., 2007]. Inactivating
SPRED1 (MIM# 609291) mutations were detected in these indi-
viduals. The disease was initially described as NF1-like syndrome
and later renamed as Legius syndrome (MIM# 611431) [Stevenson
and Viskochil, 2009; Upadhyaya, 2008]. Patients typically present
with multiple caf´e-au-lait spots sometimes associated with skin fold
freckling. Fifty percent of individuals with Legius syndrome fulﬁll
the NIH criteria for NF1 [Messiaen et al., 2009], although the pheno-
type is much milder compared with NF1 and other NF1-associated

features are not present. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the RAS–
MAPK pathway [Brems et al., 2007; Wakioka et al., 2001] similar to
neuroﬁbromin.

SPRED1 Database

A PubMed search was performed using key words SPRED1, Legius
syndrome, NF1-like syndrome. The reference list of all papers re-
trieved this way was hand searched for additional publications. Fur-
thermore, we have been offering SPRED1 mutation analysis from
2007 and added all SPRED1 mutations detected since then by our
and other research groups. Part of our results has been published
elsewhere [Brems et al., 2007; Denayer et al., 2011a; Messiaen et al.,
2009; Spencer et al., 2011]. The database describes SPRED1 muta-
tions found in unrelated individuals. For each proband, the follow-
ing data are available: the coding DNA change, based on the reference
sequence NM_152594.2, the type of alteration (substitution, dele-
tion, insertion, duplication, copy number change [CNC] involving
>1 kb), predicted effect at the protein level, exon/intron affected, ef-
fect at the RNA level, expected consequence of the alteration (mis-
sense, nonsense, frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon,
splice, silent, in-frame deletion, CNC, or deletion/duplication of
>1kb), a database ID for each individual mutation, a patient ID for
each proband, the reference describing a speciﬁc proband/family
or the submitter of the mutation to the database for unpublished
mutations, the tissue in which the SPRED1 mutation was identiﬁed,
the reference where a mutation was ﬁrst described, a synopsis of the
phenotype observed in the proband (as described in the published
report), and a comment ﬁeld mentioning whether phenotypic data
on relatives of the proband have been published. For missense alter-
ations, it is mentioned whether a known functional domain is in-
volved, whether the amino acid is evolutionary conserved, whether
functional studies support pathogenicity.

The database can be consulted at http://www.lovd.nl/SPRED1
and will be updated quarterly with data from the literature as well
as with variants identiﬁed through clinical mutation analysis at the
Medical Genomics Laboratory. Furthermore, all scientists/clinicians
are invited to submit their unpublished data to the database using an
online submission form. Submissions will be checked by the curator
(L.M.) and completed if necessary. The unpublished status will be
clearly indicated, as well as the identity of the submitter.

Clinical and Diagnostic Relevance

Clinical Features

The clinical manifestations of Legius syndrome were initially
based on the description of ﬁve families (37 individuals) with a
pathogenic SPRED1 mutation [Brems et al., 2007]. Individuals with
Legius syndrome presented with caf´e-au-lait spots with or with-
out axillary or inguinal freckling, macrocephaly. In ﬁve individuals
a Noonan-like face was present, including hypertelorism, ptosis,
short neck with a low posterior hairline, and low-set ears. Learn-
ing problems and/or attention deﬁcit were noted in six children
and developmental delay in one child. Lipomas were present in 14
individuals and a mild pectus excavatum in three individuals. A
childhood renal cancer, lung cancer, and colonadenoma were iden-
tiﬁed each in one individual.

Seven additional publications conﬁrmed the presence of caf´e-au-
lait spots, with or without freckling and the absence of neuroﬁbro-
mas and Lisch nodules in patients with Legius syndrome [Denayer
et al., 2011a; Laycock-Van Spyk et al., 2011; Messiaen et al., 2009;

Muram-Zborovski et al., 2010; Pasmant et al., 2009a; Spencer et al.,
2011; Spurlock et al., 2009]. Macrocephaly (15 of 93) and Noonan-
like characteristics (14 of 89) were reported by different research
groups (Table 1) [Denayer et al., 2011a; Laycock-Van Spyk et al.,
2011; Messiaen et al., 2009; Muram-Zborovski et al., 2010; Pasmant
et al., 2009a; Spencer et al., 2011; Spurlock et al., 2009].

Learning disabilities (24 of 115), developmental delay (20/85),
or attention deﬁcit (15/87) were noticed in all reports except by
Spurlock et al. (2009) (Table 1). One study described observations
on intelligence and behavior in 15 patients with Legius syndrome
[Denayer et al., 2011b]. The mean full scale IQ in children with
Legius syndrome did not differ from the control group but was
higher compared with NF1 patients. There were no differences in
verbal IQ, although children with Legius syndrome showed a lower
performance IQ compared with unaffected family members. Full
scale IQ and verbal IQ were signiﬁcantly lower in patients with
NF1 than in those with Legius syndrome. These preliminary data
suggested that the cognitive phenotype in children with Legius syn-
drome is milder compared with NF1.

Additional clinical features reported (Table 1) include pectus de-
formities (excavatum or carinatum) (12 of 87) [Denayer et al., 2011;
Messiaen et al., 2009; Laycock-Van Spyk et al., 2011; Spencer et al.,
2011] and unilateral postaxial polydactyly (3 of 159) [Denayer et al.,
2011; Messiaen et al., 2009]. In some patients, lipomas were re-
ported [Denayer et al., 2011; Messiaen et al., 2009; Pasmant et al.,
2009a; Spencer et al., 2011]. Furthermore, single occurrences of each
of the following malignancies have been observed: a monoblastic
acute leukemia (same case described twice) [Pasmant et al., 2009a,
2009b], giant cell tumor, dermoid tumor of the ovary, breast cancer
[Messiaen et al., 2009], vestibular schwannoma, desmoid tumor
[Denayer et al., 2011a]. It is not clear if the childhood leukemia
was related to the SPRED1 mutation as no SPRED1 second hit
mutation was found [Pasmant et al., 2009b]. Batz et al. (2010)
found no evidence of SPRED1 involvement in a small set of juve-
nile myelomonocytic leukemia cases. Large series will be necessary
to show whether there is an increased risk for childhood leukemia
in individuals with Legius syndrome. Given the actual still limited
number of identiﬁed cases, a risk for a speciﬁc complication smaller
than 1–2% cannot be excluded. For none of the other malignancies,
each observed in single cases, tumor analysis was reported and it
remains unknown whether these tumors were incidental or SPRED1
related.

In conclusion, the overall human phenotype in patients with
Legius syndrome is milder compared with patients with NF1
(Table 2). None of the individuals with Legius syndrome had discrete
cutaneous or plexiform neuroﬁbromas, typical NF1 osseous lesions,
or symptomatic optic pathway gliomas. Some other manifestations
were reported, although it is not clear yet if these manifestations are
part of the clinical phenotype (Table 1). No systematic occurrence
of a speciﬁc tumor type was detected, except possibly lipomas in
adults. However, since the total number of reported cases is rela-
tively small (with a substantial proportion of children), less frequent
associations in adults could have been missed. In order to identify
rare complications with a prevalence of 1% in adults, at least 250
adults with Legius syndrome have to be investigated [Messiaen et al.,
2009]. To date, only 159 cases (all ages) with Legius syndrome have
been reported.

Molecular Genetic Testing

Initially, Spred1 was discovered in a mouse cDNA osteoclast li-
brary [Wakioka et al., 2001]. Sequence homology modeling showed

Table 2. Overview of Clinical Signs and Features Associated (or Not Associated) with NF1 and Legius Syndrome

NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1: two or more of the following features:
• ≥ 6 caf´e-au-lait spots (> 5 mm diameter in children, > 15 mm in adults)
• ≥ 2 cutaneous or subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas or 1 plexiform neuroﬁbroma
• Axillary or inguinal freckling
• Optic pathway glioma
• ≥ 2 Lisch nodules
• Bone dysplasia (pseudarthrosis, tibial bowing, . . .)
• First-degree relative with clinical diagnosis of NF1, according to these criteria
Associated features:
• MPNST
• Scoliosis
• Macrocephaly
• Short stature
• Speciﬁc malignancies
• Learning disabilities

human SPRED1 location on chromosome 15 band q13.2 [Kato
et al., 2003]. Linkage analysis on two of the ﬁve affected fam-
ilies with mild clinical NF1-like manifestations pointed to the
same region on chromosome 15 with inactivating heterozygous
SPRED1 mutations in the affected members [Brems et al., 2007].
Human SPRED1 is a relatively small gene, spanning approximately
104.4 kb of genomic DNA. Seven exons code for a 7255 bp tran-
script with an open reading frame of 1,335 nucleotides encoding 444
amino acids.

Molecular genetic testing consists of DNA- or RNA-based se-
quence analysis of the SPRED1 coding region [Brems et al., 2007;
Messiaen et al., 2009]. Exon–intron boundaries are screened to de-
tect potential splice site defects. Recently, it was shown that CNCs
such as multi-exon deletions and whole SPRED1 gene deletions ac-
count for approximately 10% of the 40 detected SPRED1 mutations
in a cohort of 510 NF1-negative patients with multiple caf´e-au-lait
spots with or without freckling and no other signs of NF1 [Spencer
et al., 2011]. These mutations would be missed by Sanger sequenc-
ing; therefore, the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe am-
pliﬁcation, arrayCGH, or another technique to detect deletions is
advised for comprehensive genetic SPRED1 evaluation [Spencer
et al., 2011].

Since the clinical phenotype of Legius syndrome and NF1 partially
overlap, it is essential to make a correct diagnosis. The identiﬁcation
of a pathogenic SPRED1 mutation allows establishing the diagnosis
of Legius syndrome, which cannot be decided solely based on the
clinical pigmentary features alone. We recommend analyzing the
NF1 gene ﬁrst, and if negative, considering SPRED1 testing in pa-
tients with caf´e-au-lait spots with or without freckling and no other
NF1-speciﬁc diagnostic features. This recommendation is based on
the ﬁnding that a pathogenic NF1 mutation was identiﬁed in 43% of
sporadic cases (caf´e-au-lait spots only with or without freckling and
no other diagnostic criteria) and only in 1.3% a pathogenic SPRED1
mutation was identiﬁed [Messiaen et al., 2009]. In the cohort of fa-
milial cases with the same phenotypic criteria, 73% carried a NF1
mutation and 19% a SPRED1 mutation.

SPRED1 Mutations and Polymorphisms

Legius syndrome is caused by heterozygous inactivating germline
mutations in the SPRED1 gene. Familial as well as sporadic in-
dividuals have been identiﬁed [Brems et al., 2007; Denayer et al.,
2011a; Laycock-van Spyk et al., 2011; Messiaen et al., 2009; Muram-
Zborovski et al., 2010; Pasmant et al., 2009a; Spencer et al., 2011;

Spurlock et al., 2009]. In the largest study of SPRED1 mutations
published so far, 39% of the individuals with SPRED1 mutations
were sporadic cases (13 of 33) [Messiaen et al., 2009]. Pathogenic
SPRED1 mutations were only identiﬁed in the NF1-negative indi-
viduals with caf´e-au-lait spots with or without freckling and no
other NF1 diagnostic criterion.

As of January 2012, 146 probands with a SPRED1 mutation were
registered in the SPRED1-Leiden Open Variation Database. Muta-
tions are named according to the HGVS nomenclature guidelines
(www.HGVS.org) and numbered with respect to the SPRED1 cDNA
reference sequence (NM_152594.2) with the A of the start codon
marked as +1. Twenty-three probands with mutations in the SPRED1
gene are described in this report here for the ﬁrst time and 16 of these
mutations were never reported before (Supp. Table S1). These 16
unreported sequence variants consist of ﬁve frameshift, four CNCs,
four nonsense, one splice-site, and nine missense mutations. Eight
missense mutations are unclassiﬁed variants and one (p.Ser149Asn)
was previously identiﬁed as a likely benign rare variant.

Eighty-nine different variants were identiﬁed so far and the mu-
tations are distributed over the entire SPRED1 gene (Fig. 1A and
B). The majority of mutations are either truncating or result in ab-
sence of the protein, that is, 28 frameshift mutations, 19 nonsense
mutations, eight CNCs, two splicing defects, and one mutation
that affects the initiating codon (Fig. 1A and B; Supp. Table S1).
Twenty-nine missense mutations were identiﬁed until now: eight
are probably benign rare variants, three pathogenic, one suggested
to be pathogenic (based on familial segregation and amino acid con-
servation), and 17 are still unclassiﬁed and need further family and
functional studies to help clarify their signiﬁcance. Only a minority
of identiﬁed SPRED1 missense mutations is pathogenic (Fig. 1B,
Supp. Table S1).
Furthermore,

the public dbSNP135 database reports three
validated missense variants
(p.Asp274Gly, p.Val309Ala, and
p.Pro315Leu): p.Asp274Gly and p.Pro315Leu have not yet been
identiﬁed in individuals with suspected Legius syndrome (L.M.,
personal communication) and are probably benign rare variants.
Functional data conﬁrm the neutral role of the missense change
p.Val309Ala (H.B., personal communication).

There is only limited data available regarding somatic mutations
in SPRED1. Only one somatic mutation has been published [Brems
et al., 2007]. Melanocytes cultured from a caf´e-au-lait spot from
an individual with Legius syndrome showed in addition to the
∗
) a somatic frameshift SPRED1 mu-
germline mutation (p.Arg24
∗
7), resulting in complete loss-
tation (c.304dupA; p.Thr102Asnfs
of-function.

initiation codon in the reference sequence NM_152594.2. The reference protein sequence for missense mutations is NP_689807.1. The location of
mutations within the functional domains of the SPRED1gene is indicated: EVH-1, KBD, and SPR. Mutations listed in Figure 1A would be expected
to result in absence (entire gene deletions) or signiﬁcant truncation of the SPRED1mRNA (e.g., nonsense mutations, splice mutations, intragenic
deletions, or frameshift mutations). Mutations that would not be predicted to result in loss or signiﬁcant truncation (e.g., missense mutations,
in-frame deletions) are listed in Figure 1B. In addition, missense mutations that are likely benign are also listed in Figure 1B.

Genotype–Phenotype Correlation

Different pathogenic mutations (including frameshift, nonsense,
missense, in-frame deletion, CNCs, and splicing) were already
identiﬁed distributed over the SPRED1 gene, but no genotype–
phenotype correlation could be identiﬁed yet. A recent study by
Spencer et al. (2011) reported for the ﬁrst time seven individuals
carrying multi-exon to whole SPRED1 deletions. Surprisingly, the
phenotype did not differ from Legius syndrome patients with a
pathogenic point mutation in SPRED1, even in the patient where
two other genes were codeleted (TMCO5A, FAM98B). Neverthe-
less, isolated cleft palate was noticed in one patient with a large
deletion (6.6 Mb) spanning SPRED1 as well as 29 additional anno-
tated reference genes. Large deletions in this region (not including
SPRED1) were previously linked with cleft lip/palate and develop-
mental delay [Chen et al., 2008; Erdogan et al., 2007; Schwartz et al.,
1985].

To draw conclusions on genotype–phenotype correlations, clin-
ical and mutational data from more individuals with Legius syn-
drome will need to be collected in the near future.

Biological Relevance

Protein Structure and Function

The human SPRED1 protein has a molecular mass of 50 kDa,
contains 444 amino acids, and belongs to the Sprouty/SPRED fam-
ily. The SPRED family contains three members: SPRED1, SPRED2,
and SPRED3. Four isoforms of the mammalian Sprouty pro-
tein are known (SPROUTY1-4). Three functional domains are
known in SPRED1, an N-terminal Ena/Vasp Homology 1 domain
(EVH-1), a central KIT-binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal
SPROUTY-related domain (SPR), reviewed by Bundschu et al.
(2007) (Fig. 1A and B).

Most functional investigations were performed on mouse Spred1
and only limited functional data are available on human SPRED1.
Mouse Spred1 is predominantly expressed in brain, some fetal tis-
sues, and is highly enriched in the central nervous system germinal
zones during neurogenesis. Spred1 is critical for normal cortical
development, modulates progenitor self-renewal/proliferation, and
helps to maintain the integrity and organization of the germinal
zones [Phoenix and Temple, 2010].

Mouse Spred1 plays an important role in Ras/Raf signaling
[Wakioka et al., 2001]. Spred1 inhibits Ras–MAPK activation af-
ter growth factor induction, while there is no effect on Akt or Rac
activation. The SPR domain is necessary for membrane localization
and colocalization with Ras. Spred1 inhibits MAPK activity by sup-
pressing Raf activation by Ras–GTP. The KBD is involved but not
essential in ERK suppression [Nonami et al., 2004; Wakioka et al.,
2001]. Spred1 localizes in the lipid raft/caveolar fraction by virtue of
its C-terminal part (SPR) and interacts with caveolin [Nonami et al.,
2005]. Spred1 expression has an effect on the actin cytoskeleton via
its N-terminal EVH-1 and C-terminal SPR domain. Disruption of
stress ﬁber formation requires both an N-terminal EVH-1 domain
and a C-terminal SPR domain of Spred1 [Miyoshi et al., 2004].

New interaction partners of Spred1 were recently iden-
interaction was demonstrated between the
tiﬁed. A direct
microtubule-associated protein/microtubule
afﬁnity-regulating
kinase-activating kinase, Spred1, and the testis-speciﬁc protein ki-
nase (TESK1) [Johne et al., 2008]. Spred1 interacts with the two
other proteins through its C-terminal SPR domain and it has been
suggested that the three proteins affect F-actin and the microtubular

cellular network. The inhibition of TESK1 by Spred1 makes F-actin
ﬁbers dynamic. Fibroblast growth factor receptor like-1 (FGFRL1)
is another binding partner of the SPR domain; Spred1 increased the
retention time of FGFRL1 at the plasma membrane [Zhuang et al.,
2011]. The SPR domain of Spred1 interacts with the kinase domain
of a novel kinase, DYRK1A, by inhibiting the ability of DYRK1A to
phosphorylate its substrates, Tau and STAT3 [Li et al., 2010].

Mouse Spred1 is a substrate for the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.
Tyrosine dephosphorylation increases the inhibitory action of
Spred1 in the Ras/Erk pathway [Quintanar-Audelo et al., 2011].

Recently, two microRNAs were linked to Spred1, miR-126, and
miR-212. MicroRNA-126 enhances VEGF signaling during an-
giogenesis and promotes blood vessel formation by suppressing
Spred1 [Wang et al., 2008]. MicroRNA-126 positively regulates mast
cell proliferation and cytokine production by suppressing Spred1
[Ishizaki et al., 2011].

Increased striatal miR-212 activity plays an important role in the
addiction to cocaine by amplifying the stimulatory effects of cocaine
on cAMP response element binding protein signaling [Hollander
et al., 2010]. This occurs through miR-212-enhanced Raf1 activity
via Spred1 downregulation. There is a binding site for miR-212 in
the Spred1 promoter region.

Human wild-type SPRED1 also has the ability to inhibit growth
factor-induced RAS–MAPK signaling. The EVH-1 as well as the
SPR domain seem to be necessary for inhibition [Brems et al., 2007].
Other functions of human SPRED1 or ligands of the EVH-1 domain
of human SPRED1 have not yet been identiﬁed.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (27 of 32) showed decreased
expression levels of SPRED1 and SPRED2 [Yoshida et al., 2006].
SPRED1 expression inversely correlated with the tumor incidence
of invasion and metastasis. Spred1 overexpression inhibits cell pro-
liferation of this carcinoma in vitro and in vivo and inhibits the
RAS–MAPK pathway activation. The secretion of matrix metallo-
proteinases, important in tumor invasion and metastasis, was re-
duced by Spred1 overexpression.

No obvious SPRED1 immunohistochemical staining with speciﬁc
Spred1 antibodies could be shown in human adult tissue samples
[Engelhardt et al., 2004], although GeneNote shows that SPRED1
mRNA is expressed in whole human genome expression proﬁles in
normal tissues [Shmueli et al., 2003; Yanai et al., 2005]. SPRED1
is expressed in lung, brain, spinal cord, and spleen and lower ex-
pression proﬁles are seen in liver, pancreas, prostate, kidney, heart,
thymus, muscle, and bone marrow.

It has been demonstrated that SPRED1 is also expressed in hu-
man melanocytes [Brems et al., 2007]. To study the potential role of
SPRED1 in the pathogenesis of caf´e-au-lait spots, melanocyte cul-
tures from control skin (SPRED1+/+), from normal skin (SPRED1+/–),
and a caf´e-au-lait spot (SPRED1–/–) from the same patient with
Legius syndrome were compared [Brems et al., 2007]. After stimu-
lation, the functional effect was studied on the RAS–MAPK path-
way with higher levels of activated MEK and ERK in the SPRED1–/–
melanocytes and lowest levels in the SPRED1+/+ melanocytes, with
intermediate levels in the SPRED1+/– melanocytes.

Functional Analysis

Functional assays are used to evaluate the effect of the identiﬁed
human SPRED1 mutations with regard to the RAS–MAPK pathway.
In the initial paper on Legius syndrome, three different assays were
described, a biochemical analysis using HEK293T cells, a luciferase
assay, and an in vitro Raf1 kinase assay [Brems et al., 2007].

The nature of most identiﬁed mutations suggested loss-of-
function. The ability to inhibit ERK activation was investigated in
1543

HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 33, No. 11, 1538–1546, 2012

a biochemical assay of HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were tran-
siently transfected with wild type and mutated SPRED1 constructs
and cotransfected with Erk2. Cells were stimulated with bFGF or
EGF, lysed and analyzed via immunoblot. Wild-type SPRED1 was
able to inhibit ERK activation, whereas mutant constructs (for ex-
) were unable
ample, p.Ile81_Val85del, p.Met266fsVal
to reduce ERK activation. Some of the mutant SPRED1 proteins
were not stably expressed and were immediately degraded by the
proteasome. They could not be used for further analysis.

The luciferase assay was the second assay used by Brems et al.
(2007) and Messiaen et al. (2009). In this sensitive assay, FGF- or
EGF-induced ERK activation was measured by an Elk-1 responsive
reporter. Elk-1, a transcription factor, is a substrate for phosphory-
lation if the MAPK (ERK) pathway is activated. Elk-1 phosphory-
lation induces binding to the promoter region of target genes and
initiates transcription. Elk-1 activation was measured by a GAL4
DNA binding domain/Elk-1 fusion system. Overexpression of co-
transfected wild-type SPRED1 constructs efﬁciently inhibited the
activation of the MAPK pathway after stimulation, as measured by
low luciferase activity. No decrease in luciferase activity was seen
after overexpression of inactivating SPRED1 mutants.

In the third assay, an in vitro Raf1 kinase assay, 293T cells
were transiently transfected with Flag-Raf1 and SPRED1 constructs,
stimulated with FGF or EGF and cells were lysed, and immuno-
precipitated with an anti-Flag antibody. An additional incubation
step was carried out with ATP, MgCl2, and inactive recombinant
MEK1 as substrate. Immunoblots measured phosphorylated MEK
and phosphorylated Raf1 levels. Decreased Raf1 kinase activity was
observed with wild-type SPRED1 overexpression, in contrast to
mutant SPRED1.

A fourth and sensitive assay was described by Messiaen et al
(2009). In vitro neurite outgrowth of rat pheochromocytoma cells
(PC12 cells) is highly dependent on MAPK activity after nerve
growth factor (NGF) stimulation. Wild-type SPRED1 overexpres-
sion in PC12 cells inhibited the MAPK pathway activation after
NGF stimulation and decreased the number of cells showing neu-
rite outgrowth. SPRED1 overexpression of inactivating mutants did
not inhibit neurite outgrowth after NGF stimulation.

Missense Mutations

Twenty-six percent of all SPRED1 mutations identiﬁed are mis-
sense mutations: in 39 of 146 unrelated SPRED1-positive individu-
als, one of 29 different missenses has been found. Only a minority
of missense mutations was conﬁdently classiﬁed as pathogenic and
many are still unclassiﬁed. It is difﬁcult to draw ﬁnal conclusions
regarding pathogenicity of certain SPRED1 missense mutations.

We suggest that at least three different criteria are used to predict
pathogenicity [Brems et al., 2007; Denayer et al., 2011a; Messiaen
et al., 2009;]: family data, amino acid evolutionary conservation,
and two independent sensitive functional MAPK pathway assays.

A missense mutation is classiﬁed as pathogenic if the identiﬁed
SPRED1 mutation is de novo or if the mutation segregates with the
Legius syndrome phenotype in a large family. This means that only
the affected proband and affected relatives who have the clinical
signs of Legius syndrome carry the mutation. A missense mutation
is probably a rare benign variant, if it is found in an unaffected
relative.

An amino acid in the human SPRED1 protein sequence is con-
sidered to be not evolutionary conserved if another amino acid
is found in at least two of the following species Callitrix jacchus
(XP_002753607.1), Mus musculus (NP_277059.1), Rattus norvegi-
1544

cus (NP_001040554.1), Oryctolagus cuniculus (XP_002717848.1),
Bos Taurus (XP_598113.3), Xenopus tropicalis Q66JG9.1), Danio re-
rio (NP_998397.1), and Drosophila melanogaster (NP_610988.1).
Additional supportive data can be derived from either PolyPhen
(http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph) or SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org).
In addition, in silico analysis of the identiﬁed SPRED1 missense mu-
tation can be carried out by homology modeling, which will provide
additional information about the putative consequences of the re-
spective missense mutation. However, the crystal structure of X.
tropicalis only provides information of the EVH-1 domain and no
crystal structure of the KBD or SPR domain is available yet [Harmer
et al., 2005].

Finally, functional studies demonstrating that the missense mu-
tation lacks the potential to downregulate the RAS–MAPK pathway
provide the ultimate proof of pathogenicity.

We cannot exclude that some mutations that do not affect the
MAPK pathway (as evidenced by functional studies) might be
pathogenic by a different mechanism. However, there is no evi-
dence for this at the moment: all de novo mutations as well as all
known familial SPRED1 mutations segregating with the phenotype
are deﬁcient in downregulating the MAPK pathway.

Mouse Model

The Spred1 protein is well conserved during evolution with a
93.5% protein identity between human and mouse. The Spred1 gene
is located on mouse chromosome 2 and it is expressed in fetal brain,
heart, lung, liver, and bone [Engelhardt et al., 2004]. In adult tissue,
Spred1 is predominantly expressed in brain [Engelhardt et al., 2004;
Kato et al., 2003]. A conventional Spred1 knockout mouse model is
available and these mice were generated via homologous recombi-
nation with the KBD and SPR domain deleted [Inoue et al., 2005].
Spred1 knockout mice are fertile although they have a lower weight
and a shortened face [Brems et al., 2007; Inoue et al., 2005]. In an
earlier study, Spred1–/– bone marrow-derived mast cells showed en-
hanced proliferation and Erk activation after stimulation [Nonami
et al., 2004]. The Spred1 knockout mouse model was initially stud-
ied as an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma model [Inoue et al.,
2005].

Since learning problems were reported in several children with
Legius syndrome [Brems et al., 2007], the Spred1 mouse model was
investigated for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in
two different learning tasks [Denayer et al., 2008]. In the hidden ver-
sion of the Morris water maze, a spatial discrimination task, Spred1–/–
mice showed decreased performance in learning and memory. This
defect could not be explained by a difference in neuromotor perfor-
mance or sensory perception. In a second learning task, the visual
discrimination task (T-maze), where little motor proﬁciency is re-
quired, Spred1–/– mice performed signiﬁcantly worse in nearly all
stages of visual discrimination training. During the ﬁnal mixed trial
presentations, Spred1–/– mice performed poorly, with the Spred1+/–
mice at an intermediate level between the Spred1–/– and Spred1+/+
mice.

Electrophysiological recordings on brain slices from Spred1
knockout mice identiﬁed short- and long-term synaptic hippocam-
pal plasticity defects [Denayer et al., 2008], including a deﬁciency in
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression in the CA1
region. Biochemical analysis, after LTP induction, demonstrated in-
creased Erk activation in Spred1–/– slices, compared with control
brain slices.

These ﬁndings are similar to the learning and synaptic plasticity
defects in the Nf1+/– mice [Cui et al., 2008], and stress the importance

of the RAS–MAPK pathway in learning and memory. The learning
and synaptic plasticity in adult Nf1+/- mice can be acutely rescued
with lovastatin treatment [Cui et al., 2008]. Similar experiments
have not yet been reported in Spred1 mice.

Management and Future Prospects

References

At present, a less intense medical follow-up has been recom-
mended for individuals with Legius syndrome compared with NF1.
However, clinical data are only available from 159 individuals with
Legius syndrome. Therefore, it is essential to collect information
on more patients and to offer long-term clinical surveillance for
patients with Legius syndrome. Only if clinical and molecular data
from several hundred individuals are collected, we will be able to
draw conclusions regarding rare complications and potential tumor
prevalence associated with Legius syndrome. We hope that the data
will conﬁrm the low frequency of malignancies as observed so far
in patients with Legius syndrome. A correct diagnosis has impor-
tant implications for prognosis, counseling, and potential prenatal
diagnosis. The diagnosis of Legius syndrome may relieve the psy-
chological burden in families who are otherwise anxious of serious
NF1-related complications. We expect that speciﬁc therapies might
become available in the future for the treatment of cognitive prob-
lems in children with NF1 and with Legius syndrome.

Only a minority of SPRED1 missense mutations were classiﬁed
as pathogenic and some newly identiﬁed missense mutations have
not yet been fully studied (family and functional studies). It is cru-
cial to continue studying these mutations for pathogenicity. The
combination of family data (de novo or linked to the typical phe-
notype in many relatives), amino acid conservation, and functional
effects on the RAS–MAPK pathway will allow us to classify most of
these mutations with respect to their pathogenicity. However, it is
possible that some SPRED1 missense mutations result in a normal
activity to the MAPK pathway, but they still may have an abnormal
activity to another pathway. Consequently, we must remain conser-
vative and classify such mutations as “probably benign rare variant.”
Nevertheless, present data show that all SPRED1 missense mutations
segregate with the clinical pathogenic picture and are deﬁcient in the
RAS–MAPK pathway, similar as the typical inactivating mutations.
There are still clinical cases with multiple caf´e-au-lait spots, fa-
milial and sporadic, in cohorts negative for a pathogenic NF1 and
SPRED1 mutation. We know that in some sporadic cases, mosaicism
for a NF1 mutation is present, explaining the NF1 features in the
absence of a detectable NF1 mutation in white blood cells [Maertens
et al., 2007]. It is possible that other patients with multiple caf´e-au-
lait spots without a NF1 or SPRED1 mutation might be the result of
mutations in other genes with a direct or indirect link to the RAS–
MAPK pathway, as was recently shown in CBL mutation-associated

was initiated and this paper was submitted, a total of 146 unrelated
individuals carrying a SPRED1 mutation were entered. With the ﬁrst
quarterly update we have added another 44 unrelated individuals
carrying a SPRED1 mutation, increasing the number of entries with
∼30%.
