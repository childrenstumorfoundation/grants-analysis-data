Purpose of review
NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type I (NF-1), affecting 1 : 3000 people, is one of the most common
disorders of the nervous system, and most pediatricians will care for a patient with
this condition. It is imperative that careful attention be paid to screening for scoliosis
and tibial dysplasia. Prompt referral to an orthopaedist at the time of diagnosis, as
well as neurologist, ophthalmologist, and dermatologist, will provide a global spectrum
of care for the individual. Patient care between surgical procedures will be inevitable,
with 70% of patients with NF-1 undergoing hospitalization or surgery.
Recent Ô¨Åndings
This review provides a description of diagnosis, presurgical evaluation, and advances in
understanding tibial dysplasia, scoliosis and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
New pharmaceutical treatments such as lovastatin have improved bone healing in vivo
and induced apoptosis in vitro. Multiple pharmaceuticals have shown neuroÔ¨Åbroma
arrest in vitro and are in phase II clinical trials.
Summary
As animal models improve and clinical trials proceed, there is momentum toward
eliminating the musculoskeletal morbidity associated with NF-1.

Introduction
The spectrum of diseases involving nerve sheath tumors
includes NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis 1 (NF-1), neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis
2 (NF-2) and Schwannomatosis. NF-1 is characterized by
the presence of neuroÔ¨Åbromas, which are benign nerve
sheath tumors containing Schwann cells, Ô¨Åbroblasts, mast
cells, and collagen [1,2]. Similarly, NF-2 and Schwanno-
matosis are characterized by benign Schwann cell tumors
of the nerve sheath. The tumors can be superÔ¨Åcial or
deep, and discrete (involving a single nerve fascicle) or
plexiform (involving multiple fascicles) [1]. The differ-
ential diagnosis also includes tuberous sclerosis, compre-
hensively reviewed by Arbuckle and Morelli [3] in 2000,
and other conditions with cafe¬¥ -au-lait spots as reviewed
by Jett and Friedman [4] in 2010.

Schwannomatosis
Schwannomatosis is a disease of adulthood characterized
by painful peripheral nerve sheath tumors without other
body systems affected. NF-2 and Schwannomatosis can
be diagnostically confusing, but the distinction is made
by a lack of vestibular disease in Schwannomatosis [5]. A
group out of Massachusetts General Hospital presents
whole body MRI as a diagnostic tool to determine total
body tumor burden in this and other nerve sheath tumor

diseases. The advantage of MRI can be discovery of
occult tumors and measurement of response to treatment
without ionizing radiation [1].

NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 2
NF-2 most commonly presents as unilateral hearing
loss proceeded by tinnitus from benign vestibular
Schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve. The tumors
are found to be bilateral and can initially present as
dizziness [6]. Late symptoms include nausea, vomiting
and vertigo [6]. Prevalence of NF-2 is 1 : 40 000‚Äì60 000,
and inheritance is autosomal dominant transmission of
the tumor suppressor NF-2 gene on chromosome 22
[5,6]. Fifty percent of cases involve a new mutation.
In addition to Schwannomas, cranial and spinal menin-
giomas and low-grade central nervous system ependy-
momas lead to substantial morbidity and early mortality.
These patients rarely present with musculoskeletal pro-
blems. Current treatment of peripheral Schwannomas
is resection, or radiation for larger tumors [6]. In a
recent study, Bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial
growth factor
(VEGF) monoclonal antibody, was
found to reduce vestibular schwannoma volume and
induce a hearing response [7]. Anti-VEGF medications
have been reported in the literature for treatment of
NF-1 [8].

NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1
The multiple systemic comorbidities associated with
NF-1 are often more troubling than the neuroÔ¨Åbromas
which characterize this disease. The incidence of NF-1
is 1 : 3000, and NF-1 is an autosomal dominant, single
gene mutation of a tumor suppressor found on chromo-
some 17q11.2 [9]. In order to deÔ¨Ånitively diagnose NF-
1, a patient must have two of the following seven
than six cafe¬¥ -au-lait
characteristic features: greater
macules, neuroÔ¨Åbromas, axillary or inguinal freckling,
optic nerve glioma, Lisch nodules, a distinctive osseous
lesion and family history of NF-1 in a Ô¨Årst degree
relative.

Diagnosis
The most common feature at diagnosis is hyperpigmen-
ted macules, or cafe¬¥ -au-lait spots. A diagnosis of NF-1 is
made in 97% of patients by age 8 [10]. Direct sequencing
of the causative mutation is possible in 95% of those with
NF-1 [11]. In addition, prenatal and pre-implantation
testing is possible for diagnosis [9]. Once the diagnosis is
suspected, regular yearly screening should be initiated,
because patients may not manifest all of their diagnostic
criteria until young adulthood. The phenotype of NF-1 is
extremely variable.

Nonorthopaedic manifestations
A thorough review of the features of NF-1 is presented by
Williams et al. [11] in 2009 and the authors highly
recommend reference to this manuscript for comprehen-
sive management of the patient with NF-1.

Plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas
NeuroÔ¨Åbromas can be cutaneous, subcutaneous, para-
spinal, or more integrated into nerve tissue in the form
of plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas. At least 30‚Äì60% of people
with NF-1 have plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas [4,12]. These
benign tumors can become problematic when they
expand and impinge on structures or undergo malignant
transformation [8,12]. The lesions appear to grow more
quickly at younger ages, and patients may beneÔ¨Åt from
early removal prior to invasion of contiguous structures;
however, this still remains controversial [13,14]. NeuroÔ¨Å-
broma resection does carry the risk of neurologic injury
from surgery, as well as risk of recurrence, since the
tumors are often diffusely inÔ¨Åltrative and difÔ¨Åcult to
remove entirely [9].

Spinal deformities
The most common orthopaedic manifestation of NF-1
is scoliosis, with 21‚Äì49% of patients having some

abnormality [15,16,17]. Because of the high prevalence
of scoliosis associated with NF-1, routine screening
for scoliosis is recommended with a low threshold for
obtaining radiographs and orthopaedic referral. Scoliosis
falls into two categories: nondystrophic and dystrophic
[17]. Dystrophic curves are characterized by radio-
graphic abnormalities such as rib penciling (the rib
diameter is smaller than the midportion of the second
rib), vertebral rotation, vertebral scalloping, vertebral
wedging, wide interpedicular distance, and enlarged
intervertebral foramen [16]. The dystrophic scoliotic
deformity is a short, sharp, angular curve involving four
to six vertebrae (Fig. 1). Although nondystrophic curves
appear radiographically similar to adolescent idiopathic
scoliotic curves, nondystrophic curves may be rapidly
progressive. Nondystrophic curves can change or modu-
late over
time to become dystrophic curves. This
phenomenon of modulation occurs more frequently
when three or more ribs have penciling or the curve is
present before the age of 7 [16,18]. Treatment recom-
mendations for nondystrophic curves include brace man-
agement for curves between 208 and 358 [19]. Surgical
fusion is recommended for nondystrophic curves pro-
gressing past 358. Dystrophic curves rarely respond to
brace management, and surgical fusion is recommended
for curves over 208 (Fig. 2). Anterior and posterior
spinal fusion is recommended for curves with kyphosis
over 508 [15].

One of the serious complications of surgical management
of dystrophic scoliosis is pseudarthrosis, or lack of fusion,
which occurs in 63% of patients with NF-1 receiving
posterior spinal fusion [20]. With current surgical tech-
niques and modern implants, the pseudarthrosis rate in
more recent studies is 20% with anterior and posterior
fusion [21]. Kyphosis in NF-1 is particularly concerning
because the high risk of spinal cord injury. As the
kyphosis progresses, the spinal cord is draped over the
gibbus deformity, or sharply angled hump, resulting in
progressive stretch injury and possibly paraplegia if
untreated. Another rare cause of spinal cord injury is
atraumatic subluxation of the ribs into the neural fora-
men. This is best diagnosed on axial imaging with com-
puted tomography or MRI.

Cervical spine
The cervical spine deserves special attention because
many patients with NF-1 will undergo general anesthesia
at some point. Common cervical spine deformities
include cervical kyphosis, subaxial subluxation and atlan-
toaxial instability [22]. Cervical kyphosis is most com-
monly iatrogenic, resulting from prior laminectomy for
decompression of nerve sheath tumors. It is recom-
mended that all patients with NF-1 have routine cervical
spine radiographs prior to general anesthesia in order to
avoid cervical cord injury. Routine clinical screening
should also be used to rule out torticollis and neuroÔ¨Å-
bromas of the neck [22]. Rarely, skull base pathology may
be suspected in patients with NF-1 and velopharyngeal
insufÔ¨Åciency. This is a speech disorder attributed to
abnormal nasal Ô¨Çow during speech secondary to brain-
stem tumors. Forty-six per cent of patients with this
speech abnormality had brain stem tumors in one study
[8].

Intraspinal pathology
Intraspinal pathology in NF-1 may include neuroÔ¨Åbro-
mas which straddle the neural foramina and which may
cause compression injuries of the nerve roots. These are
commonly referred to as dumbbell lesions and may be
decompressed if causing neural injury. The vertebral
spinal canal is often expanded in association with thin-
ning of the bony elements including pedicle and laminae
resulting in a condition called dural ectasia. Despite the

Orthopaedic aspects of neurofibromatosis DeLucia et al. 49

progressive osseous erosion of the vertebral canal and
bodies in dural ectasia, there is a relatively low rate of
neurodeÔ¨Åcit. Presumably, this canal expansion occurs
slowly, resulting in more room for the cord. A current,
alternative causative hypothesis of dural ectasia is meso-
dermal dysplasia rather than a focal expansion of the dura
from increased Ô¨Çuid pressure [8].

Congenital tibial dysplasia
Characteristic anterolateral tibial bowing (describes the
direction of apex of the deformity) and associated tibial
dysplasia are found in 5% of patients with NF-1 [15]. In
many cases, the diagnosis of NF-1 is Ô¨Årst suspected
secondary to the initial presentation of a child with
anterolateral tibial bow and fracture (Fig. 3). The diag-
nosis of NF-1 includes ‚Äòa distinctive osseous lesion such
as a sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of lone bone
cortices, with or without pseudarthrosis‚Äô [23]. The cor-
tices in the tibial dysplasia are thickened with small
medullary canals as opposed to previous diagnostic
descriptions of cortical thinning in bowing [23]. Individ-
uals with NF-1, but without congenital tibial dysplasia,
also have altered tibial anatomy as measured by cross-
sections of computed tomography and compared with
unaffected controls [24]. Even though congenital pseud-
arthrosis of the tibia is rare even in NF-1, 75% of
individuals who present with this ‚Äòfalse joint formation
of the tibia‚Äô will have NF-1 [17]. The pathologic tissue
in tibial dysplasia consists of hyperplasia of Ô¨Åbroblasts
with formation of dense Ô¨Åbrous tissue. This dysplasia is a

spectrum progressing from failure of long-bone tubula-
tion to fracture to pseudarthrosis. At the more extreme
end of the spectrum is tibial nonunion.

Fractures associated with tibial dysplasia and NF-1 rarely
heal spontaneously and are associated with progressive
angulation, limb length deÔ¨Åciency and ankle instability.
Although the tibia is the most common site of long-bone
dysplasia and pseudarthrosis in NF-1, other bones may be
affected, including the ulna, femur, clavicle, radius and
humerus.

The initial treatment for dysplasia is total contact bracing
to prevent fracture. Knee‚Äìankle‚Äìfoot orthoses and later
ankle‚Äìfoot orthoses are used through skeletal maturity
in an attempt to prevent fracture. In the setting of
pseudarthrosis or fracture of the dysplastic tibia, surgery
is currently recommended. There are multiple surgical
alternatives, but all surgical procedures include thorough
excision of pseudarthrosis and Ô¨Åbrous tissue. After
resection is completed, the limb may be reconstructed
with intermedullary Ô¨Åxation and iliac crest bone grafting
to the pseudarthrosis site using the Williams Rod tech-
nique (Fig. 4). Other alternatives include free vascular-
ized Ô¨Åbula transplant to the pseudarthrosis site or limb
reconstruction utilizing bone transport and Ilizarov

technique with external Ô¨Åxation. Even after surgical
stabilization, bracing is recommended until maturity.
Clinical treatments on the horizon include lovastatin,
for, in an NF-1 mouse model with tibial bowing, the
cholesterol-lowering drug led to increased biomechani-
cal properties of fracture callous [8]. A case report of
mesenchymal stromal cell transplant into tibial pseudar-
throsis demonstrated new bone formation with increased
mineral content [25].

Bone mineral density
Children with NF-1 have decreased bone mineral con-
tent compared with age-matched controls in the absence
of any orthopaedic issues [26]. In adults with NF-1,
osteoporosis occurs earlier than the postmenopausal peak
in women [8]. Unfortunately, there are no clinical trials
to support therapeutic use of bisphosphonates in NF-1,
and treatment should be directed toward normalizing
vitamin levels [27].

Muscle force
A recent study found that in addition to decreased muscle
cross-sectional area in limbs of individuals with NF-1,
muscular force is reduced in patients with NF-1 as

compared with age, gender and activity level-matched
controls [28].

Malignancy
Malignant transformation of plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas to
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)
occurs in 10% of the population with NF-1 [29]. There
is a high risk of mortality, with 5-year survival being 35%
in NF-1 patients [29]. Negative outcomes are associated
with MPNSTs greater than 10 cm, partial resection and
metastasis, but even wide surgical excision with post-
operative radiotherapy does not improve survival rates
[29]. Case reports of malignant transformation exist when
benign plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas were treated with radio-
therapy [8]. Any neuroÔ¨Åbroma with expansion, persist-
ent pain or new neurologic deÔ¨Åcit warrants further inves-
tigation for malignancy. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography may be helpful in differentiating
between benign plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas and MPNSTs
[30]. Upon biopsy, immunohistochemistry for KI-67 and
S-100 is important to differentiate between benign plexi-
form neuroÔ¨Åbromas and MPNSTs [31]. NeuroÔ¨Åbromin,
the product of the NF1 gene, most likely functions to
decrease Ras, a signaling protein in cell growth. When
neuroÔ¨Åbromin is absent in NF-1, Ras provides unabated
signaling of cell growth. One proposed mechanism is that
MPNSTs are formed when a member of the Ras family of
proteins, Ral, has overactivation in conjunction with
activation of
the phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) signaling pathway [32,33].

An increased risk of other malignancies is found in
patients with NF-1 [34]. For example, a group in
Birmingham, UK found an eight-fold increase in the
presence of bone sarcomas in patients with NF-1 com-
pared with the normal population [35].

Pharmacologic treatment
In vitro, Tranilast, an anti-allergic drug, was found to
suppress NF-1 cell culture population, presumably
through action on mast cells present in neuroÔ¨Åbromas
[2]. Also in vitro, a combination of farnesyl transferase and
lovastatin was found to induce apoptosis and lower
malignant cell numbers within an NF-1 culture [36].

Defects in neuroÔ¨Åbromin in a mouse model have pro-
duced the same congenital tibial dysplasia and neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas as in humans and are being used for various drug
treatments [27,37]. In a mouse NF-1 model with tibial
bowing, lovastatin was found to reverse the downregula-
tion of Runx2 and accelerate new bone formation [37,38].
The unique characteristic of loss of tumor suppressor
genes in these mice gives insights into the development
of tumorigenesis [39].

Orthopaedic aspects of neurofibromatosis DeLucia et al. 51

Multiple phase II clinical trials are ongoing to reduce
plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbroma tumor volume, including: Rapa-
mycin [an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) in the Ras pathway], tipifarnib (a farnesyl
transferase inhibitor in the Ras pathway), thalidomide,
pirfenidone (an antiÔ¨Åbrotic agent), interferon, Imatinib or
sorafenib, a Raf kinase [8,27].

Conclusion
NF-1 is one of the most common disorders of the nervous
system, and most pediatricians will care for a patient with
this condition. It is imperative that careful attention be
paid to screening for scoliosis and tibial dysplasia.
Prompt referral to an orthopaedist at the time of diag-
nosis, as well as a neurologist, ophthalmologist, and
dermatologist, will provide a global spectrum of care
for the individual. Multiple surgical procedures will be
inevitable, with 70% of patients with NF-1 undergoing
hospitalization or
surgery [40]. As animal models
improve and the clinical trials proceed, there is momen-
tum toward eliminating the musculoskeletal morbidity
associated with NF-1.
