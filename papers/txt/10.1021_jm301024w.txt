ABSTRACT: The discovery and optimization of a series of
6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine compounds that are
ATP-competitive, selective inhibitors of protein kinase B/Akt
is reported. The initial design and optimization was guided by
the use of X-ray structures of inhibitors in complex with Akt1
and the closely related protein kinase A. The resulting
compounds demonstrate potent inhibition of all three Akt
isoforms in biochemical assays and poor inhibition of other
members of
the cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein
kinase G/protein kinase C extended family and block the
phosphorylation of multiple downstream targets of Akt in
human cancer cell
lines. Biological studies with one such
compound, 28 (GDC-0068), demonstrate good oral exposure resulting in dose-dependent pharmacodynamic eﬀects on
downstream biomarkers and a robust antitumor response in xenograft models in which the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase−Akt−
mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is activated. 28 is currently being evaluated in human clinical trials for the treatment of
cancer.

■ INTRODUCTION
Protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt is a serine−threonine kinase, a
downstream target for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
which comprises three closely related isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and
Akt3). Akt functions as a pivotal node in the PI3K−Akt−mTOR
pathway; once activated, Akt can control key cellular processes
by phosphorylating substrates involved in apoptosis,
tran-
scription, cell cycle progression, and translation.1 Akt activity is
frequently elevated in cancer due to ampliﬁcation and/or gain-of-
function mutations of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases and/or
PI3K, as well as loss of PTEN function, a negative regulator of
Akt.2 Constitutive activation or overexpression of Akt isoforms
has been identiﬁed in a wide variety of human tumors, including
breast, prostate, ovarian carcinoma, and melanoma.2 shRNA

three isoforms.3 Combined,

Strategies for targeting Akt have included both ATP-
competitive, active-site-directed inhibitors, and non-ATP-

competitive allosteric compounds. Several advanced Akt
inhibitors, representing both classes of compounds, were or are
being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers.5
Herein, we report on the discovery and preclinical character-
ization of 28 (GDC-0068), a highly selective pan-Akt inhibitor
that targets the ATP-binding cleft.

As detailed in previous work,6,7 compounds exempliﬁed by 1
and 2 (Figure 1) demonstrated potent inhibition of Akt in
biochemical assays (Akt1 enzyme inhibition, IC50, of 3 and 1 nM
for 1 and 2, respectively), reduced phosphorylation of Akt
substrates in cellular assays (e.g., reduction of p-PRAS40 levels in
LNCaP cells with IC50 values of 160 and 137 nM for 1 and 2,
respectively), and down-regulation of Akt signaling in xenograft
models of human cancer in nude mice. While the lack of kinase
selectivity and resulting tolerability issues hindered the develop-
ment of 1, compound 2 displayed a signiﬁcantly improved
selectivity proﬁle versus kinases such as PKA (PKA enzyme
inhibition IC50/Akt1 enzyme inhibition IC50 = 35), ROCK1, and

followed by cyclization upon heating with formamide and
ammonium formate to deliver pyrimidones 6a−c. Phorphorous
oxychloride-mediated chlorination followed by SnAr introduc-
tion of the Boc-protected piperazine linker delivered 7a−c.
Oleﬁn 7c was converted to alcohol 7d by ozonolysis, followed by
reductive workup with NaBH4 and chiral supercritical ﬂuid
chromatography (SFC) separation of the resulting racemic
alcohol. 7d was then further functionalized by treatment with n-
perﬂuorobutanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (PBSF) and HF−Et3N10 to
aﬀord 7e. Removal of the Boc group in 7a−e provided 8a−e as
dihydrochloride salts.

C7-hydroxylated and -ﬂuorinated cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine
cores were synthesized as illustrated in Scheme 2. Introduction of
the C7-hydroxyl
functionality was facilitated by N-oxide
formation of 7a followed by N-oxide acylation and concomitant
rearrangement upon heating to give acetate 9 in a 3:2 cis−trans
orientation. Hydrolysis of the acetate and subsequent Swern
oxidation led to ketone 10. Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation11
using a ruthenium catalyst, RuCl(p-cymene)[(R,R)-TsDPEN],
gave the desired (R)-alcohol 12a in diastereomeric excess
ranging from 94% to 98%. To obtain diastereomerically pure
material, the alcohol was converted to the p-nitrophenyl ester,
which enabled separation by either column chromatography or
recrystallization. Hydrolysis of the p-nitrophenyl ester followed
by acid-mediated N-Boc deprotection revealed the key amine
intermediate 12b in excellent diastereomeric excess (>99% by
HPLC) as the dihydrochloride salt. The (S)-alcohol intermediate
13b was prepared in a similar manner except for using the S,S
ruthenium catalyst
in the asymmetric hydrogenation step.
Ketone 10, (R)-alcohol 12a, and (S)-alcohol 13a were treated
with DAST12 to give the corresponding ﬂuorinated products,
which were deprotected under acidic conditions to yield the
diﬂuoro core 11b, cis-ﬂuoro core 14b, and trans-ﬂuoro core 15b.
In Scheme 3, a convenient method for the preparation of
optically active β-phenylalanine amino acids is described. The
Evans auxiliary (R)-4-benzyloxazolidin-2-one (16) was coupled
with 2-(4-chlorophenyl)acetyl chloride to give oxazolidin-2-one

other related AGC family members and was well tolerated while
showing signiﬁcant antitumor activity in PC3-NCI prostate
cancer xenograft models.7 The present work builds on our
experiences with 1 and 2 and utilizes the dihydrocyclopentapyr-
imidine core (exempliﬁed by 3) as a platform to further explore
the selective inhibition of Akt. With suitable substitution around
this core, potent Akt-selective compounds have been identiﬁed
that exhibit druglike properties and are suitable candidates for
clinical evaluation.

■ CHEMISTRY

The general synthetic routes used to prepare 6,7-dihydro-5H-
cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine derivatives are outlined in the following
schemes.

As shown in Scheme 1, preparation of the 5(R)-methyl-
substituted cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine core requires rapid access
to the β-keto ester intermediate 5a. We decided to capitalize on
the commercially available natural product chiral pool.
Speciﬁcally, we searched for a starting material that could be
readily manipulated into the desired β-keto ester, while allowing
us to incorporate the desired methyl stereochemistry. Thus,
commercially available (+)-pulegone (4) was sequentially
reacted with bromine and sodium ethoxide to smoothly undergo
ring contraction via a Favorskii rearrangement. Subsequent
ozonolysis and reduction with zinc dust in acetic acid gave the
desired chiral keto ester 5a in excellent yield. Construction of the
pyrimidine ring was carried out by initial conversion of β-keto
esters 5a, 5b,8 and 5c9 to enamines by ammonium acetate

carbamates 18 aﬀorded 19a−g in good yield and diastereoiso-
meric ratio (for example, 14:1 diastereomeric excess (de) for
19a). The diastereomers were easily separated by silica gel
column chromatography. Basic hydrolysis of the chiral auxiliary
provided the desired β-amino acids in excellent enantiopurity. N-
Unsubstituted amino acid 20h was synthesized by sequential
cleavage of the p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) group and the
chiral auxiliary in 19f. In a similar manner, preparation of amino
acids 23i−k with cyclic amines was accomplished by stereo-
selective coupling of the Evans imide 17 with α-methoxy
heterocycles 21i−k followed by basic hydrolysis of
the
oxazolidinone auxiliary.13

With the requisite cores and β-phenylalanine amino acids in
hand, preparation of the desired compounds was achieved by
amide coupling, followed by Boc deprotection under acidic
conditions, as exempliﬁed in Scheme 4. The primary and
secondary amines were further elaborated by reductive
amination with Na(OAc)3BH and aldehydes or ketones to
aﬀord the corresponding substituted amines.

Several analogues with CH2CF3- and t-Bu-substituted amines
or cyclic tertiary amines were synthesized by an alternative route
as outlined in Scheme 5. Alkylation of the primary amine 55a

Alternatively, phenyl acetate esters 56a,b were converted to the
acrylates 57a,b as previously reported.6,7 Michael addition of
amines followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester provided 58b−
e as racemates, which were then coupled with the C7-
hydroxylated core 12b. Finally, all diastereomeric pairs were
resolved by chiral stationary-phase HPLC or chiral SFC to obtain
desired compounds 37, 39, 40, 51, and 52. The stereochemical
assignments of compounds 37, 39, 40, 51, and 52 were based on
the results of
the Akt1 enzyme inhibition assay. All
diastereomeric pairs were tested, and the active diastereomer
was then assigned the stereochemistry shown in Scheme 5 on the
basis of the activity of highly similar compounds prepared
enantioselectively.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Analysis of a series of X-ray structures of the pyrrolopyrimidine
and dihydrothienopyrimidine hinge-binding cores bound to
Akt1 and PKA suggested that increased steric bulk near the
gatekeeper residue tended to improve the selectivity proﬁle
relative to PKA and ROCK1/2. This was principally due to
diﬀerences between Akt1 and PKA that include Thr211 (Akt1)
to Val (PKA), Met281 (Akt1) to Leu, and Ala230 (Akt1) to Val,
which lead to a narrower and less polar cavity in PKA, which
should be less forgiving of larger hinge-binding functionality (cf.
Figure 2, ref 7). The saturated ring and larger sulfur atom of
dihydrothienopyrimidine 2 confer 35-fold selectivity for Akt1
versus PKA, while pyrrolopyrimidine 1 is only 2-fold selective.
The increased polarity of the Akt1 active site conferred by

reasonable animal pharmacokinetics (PK).6,7 Thus,
these
features were maintained during our initial exploration of the
hinge-binding motif.

From our previous eﬀorts, methyl substitution at the 5- and 6-
positions of
the pyrrolopyrimidine core yielded a modest
increase in selectivity over PKA.6 Coupled with the selectivity
data of the dihydrothienopyrimidine core, we targeted the
dihydrocyclopentapyrimidine core as it aﬀorded a better
platform to explore additional substitution around the saturated
these analogues prepared (Figure 1, 3)
ring. The ﬁrst of
maintained the overall substitution pattern of 2 and proved to be
potent, with Akt1 IC50 = 6 nM, Akt2 IC50 = 12 nM, Akt3 IC50 = 5
nM, LNCaP cell p-PRAS40 IC50 = 287 nM, and 6-fold selectivity
over PKA (PKA IC50 = 33 nM). Screening of 3 against a broad
panel of 225 kinases found the compound displayed potent
inhibition against only 5 additional kinases (>90% inhibition at 1
μM versus PRKG1α, PRKG1β, p70S6K, MSK1, and MSK2) and
moderate potency against 14 kinases (>50% inhibition at 1 μM)
and thus appeared to be reasonably selective.15 Permeability of 3
was high, as measured in a Caco-2 assay: 13.2 × 10−6 cm/s (apical
to basolateral, A to B) and 19.2 × 10−6 cm/s for the reverse
direction (basolateral to apical, B to A). The compound also
displayed a high predicted free fraction with 51% human plasma
protein binding. Unfortunately, 3 possessed a rapid in vitro
clearance in human hepatocytes (15 mL/min/kg). Given the
excellent selectivity, potency, and permeability properties of 3, it
represented a good starting point for further optimization eﬀorts.

dihydrothienopyrimidine inhibitor bound to Akt1, we reasoned
that,
in the absence of signiﬁcant changes in the enzyme
structure, only relatively small substituents would be tolerated at
the 5- and 7-positions of the analogous dihydrocyclopentapyr-
imidine core (Figure 2). Moreover, due to the proximity of
protein atoms, there is more space available above the plane of
the bicycle in the 5-position and below the plane of the bicycle in
the 7-position. The environment above the plane of the bicycle is

pocket in the vicinity of the hinge (hydrogens added for clarity).

Thr211 could be exploited with complementary polar atoms on
the inhibitor; for example, the dihydrofuranyl derivative of 2
showed >25-fold selectivity for Akt1 over PKA while maintaining
druglike properties.7 Inhibition by a series of spirochromane
compounds has also revealed that PKA inhibition is much more
dependent on the nature of the hinge-binding motif than Akt
inhibition,14 again pointing to utility of this region of the Akt
active site for generating selectivity. On the basis of these
observations and a desire to further improve the selectivity
proﬁle of 2, we decided to pursue additional changes to the
hinge-binding motif designed to take advantage of these key
insights. In previous analyses of the structure−activity relation-

and dihydrothienopyrimidine compounds, 4-chlorophenyl with

largely lipophilic (side chains of Ala177, Val164, Phe225, and
Met227), while below the plane it is more hydrophilic (side
chains of Thr211 and Thr291) and includes a water molecule
coordinated by the backbone and side chain of Glu228.
Interestingly, no water molecules are seen proximal to this site
in 64 publicly available crystal structures of PKA (multiple
inhibitor classes bound and with the majority of the crystals
diﬀracting to better than 2.5 Å) except in cases where Val123 of
PKA has been mutated to alanine (equivalent to Ala230 in Akt1),
presumably because the increased hydrophobic bulk of valine
makes this site unfavorable to water. We note that, in an aligned
set of 470 human kinase sequences, only 5% have an alanine
corresponding to Ala230 of Akt1, only 11% have a threonine
corresponding to Thr211, and only Akt has both. Thus,
hydrophilic ligand substituents in the vicinity of Thr211 and
the water molecule would be expected to improve selectivity over
not only PKA, but also most other kinases.

Polarity at the 5-position of the dihydrocyclopentapyrimidine
core (compound 27) did not improve the selectivity and resulted
in a loss of potency. Increasing the size of the C5 substituent with
hydrophobic groups (26, 33) tended to increase the potency
slightly, but aﬀorded no increase in selectivity over PKA. Note
that disubstitution at C5 (25) resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
potency, which is consistent with the narrow nature of both the
Akt and PKA active sites. One particularly interesting ﬁnding that
emerged from substitution on the core is the proﬁle of the cis
conﬁguration (Table 1, compounds 29 and 31) relative to the
corresponding trans analogues. From this comparison, the cis
substitution for both the ﬂuoro and hydroxy substituents
produces an equivalent proﬁle, with high potency against Akt1
and much lower potency against PKA. However, for the trans
conﬁguration (compounds 28 and 30), the proﬁle diverges
dramatically with over a 182-fold separation in PKA activities
between the two analogues. The (R)-F substituent of 30 is small
enough to ﬁt within the cavity near the hinge of PKA; however,
this is clearly not the case for the equivalent hydroxy substitution
as both the size and polarity of the substituent lead to a signiﬁcant
loss of PKA activity. Interestingly, even though both the R and S
conﬁgurations of both the ﬂuoro and hydroxy groups at C7 are
potent against Akt, the diﬂuoro analogue (compound 32) was
poorly tolerated. The C7-(R)-hydroxyl combined with the C5-
(R)-methyl substitution (Table 1, compound 28) gave ca. 620-
fold selectivity versus PKA and aﬀorded good cell potency.
Testing against a broad panel of 230 kinases, 28 only inhibited 3
kinases by >70% at 1 μM concentration (PRKG1α, PRKG1β,
and p70S6K, with subsequent IC50 values determined to be 98,
69, and 860 nM, respectively).15 From our perspective, the
dihydrocyclopentapyrimidinol core had the desired pan-AKT
potency proﬁle and achieved the level of selectivity we felt would
ensure a wide safety margin on the basis of our prior eﬀorts.

The binding mode of

the 6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]-
pyrimidine core was conﬁrmed by crystallography: the crystal
structure of 28 shows that the pyrimidine ring interacts via a
hydrogen bond to the amide NH of Ala230 (the N−N distance is
2.97 Å), illustrated in Figure 3. The hydroxyl donates a hydrogen
bond to the backbone carbonyl of Glu228 (the O−O distance is
2.66 Å). The isopropylamine side chain interacts in the carbonyl-
rich region with the carboxylate side chains of Glu234 (2.96 Å)
and Glu278 (2.75 Å). The 4-chlorophenyl group occupies a small
hydrophobic pocket under the P-loop that is formed when
Phe161 is displaced toward the C-helix. As noted above, one of
the key diﬀerences we targeted between Akt and PKA, or
ROCK1, is the presence of Ala230 (Akt1) in the hinge. The small

side chain of Ala230 in Akt1 creates a pocket that enables
substitution of
the dihydrocyclopentapyrimidine core with
various groups that aﬀord a high degree of selectivity.

In the previous dihydrothieno- and dihydrofuropyrimidine
series, metabolism studies identiﬁed that amine dealkylation was
the major metabolic reaction.7 On the basis of similar metabolite
identiﬁcation studies, N-dealkylation and oxidation of the core
hydroxyl substituent to form the corresponding ketone were the
primary routes of metabolism of 28 in vitro. The stability,
assessed by predicted in vitro clearance in human hepatocytes for
28, was 8 mL/min/kg. Given the nature of
the amine
metabolism, we sought to synthesize analogues with varying
degrees of polarity, size, and basicity in an eﬀort to reduce the
oxidative loss of the isopropyl group, illustrated in Table 2.

As we observed in the dihydrothienopyrimidine series of
compounds,7 the secondary amines tended to possess better cell
potency relative to the primary amines (e.g., 34 vs 35), likely due
to reduced permeability of the latter. The stability in human
hepatocytes for 35 decreased signiﬁcantly (predicted clearance of
11 mL/min/kg). Interestingly,
inhibition of PKA does not
change for the primary amines, giving rise to a reduced selectivity
vs Akt1 for these compounds. Akt1 inhibition is tolerant of many
small aliphatic amine substitutions (35−38), while predicted
clearance ranged from 9 to 14 mL/min/kg in human hepatocytes
for these compounds. Similarly, the tertiary amine analogue of 28
led to only a slight degradation of potency and selectivity (42);
however, the predicted clearance increased to 11 mL/min/kg.
Larger cyclic aliphatic substitutions of the amine are also well
tolerated, with the enzyme potency, cell-based activity, and PKA
selectivity all within ca. 5-fold of those of 28 (41, 44, 45, and 46).
Constraining the amine also had little eﬀect on inhibition of Akt
(47 and 48), although in the case of the pyrrolidine analogue
(43) there was a degradation in PKA selectivity. Compound 43
did demonstrate improved stability (clearance in human
hepatocytes, 3 mL/min/kg). Likewise, polar additions to the
amine chain (39) produced lower clearance compounds (3 mL/
min/kg); however, this came at the expense of PKA selectivity.
The expected binding mode of these compounds has the amine
situated at the lip of the ATP pocket such that these larger
substitutions can project into the solvent, thus providing a
potential mechanism to alter the physicochemical properties of
the inhibitors without signiﬁcantly compromising the potency.
However, the basicity of the amine is an important driver of
potency; reducing the pKa below 6.5 led to an 8-fold drop in cell

potency (36), while reducing the pKa below 3.0 led to a 180-fold
decrease in enzyme activity (37). Although some of
the
analogues in Table 2 did show modest improvements in potency,
none had dramatic improvements in metabolic stability while
retaining cellular potency and selectivity.

Finally, we explored the eﬀect of amine substitution in
conjunction with aromatic ring changes to probe the contacts

with the underside of the P-loop of Akt1 (Table 3). Replacing the
4-Cl with a 4-CF3 group improves the potency in the context of
the primary amine (comparing 49 and 34), although selectivity
over PKA is still only moderate. Addition of a 3-F group to the
secondary amines gives analogues with similar potency and
selectivity over PKA (compare 50 to 28 or 54 to 44). Combining
the 3-F with the 4-CF3 substitution led to a 3−4-fold

improvement in enzyme and cellular potency; however, this
substitution pattern reduces the selectivity ratio of PKA/Akt1 to
be ca. 35-fold or less (e.g., comparing 53 to 35 or 52 to 39).
While compounds 52 and 53 did show improved cellular
potency, the predicted stability (clearance of 7 and 13 mL/min/
kg in human hepatocytes, respectively) decreased, presumably
due to the increased lipophilicity of the 3-F-4-CF3 substitution.
From our exploration of the structure−activity relationship
around the dihydrocyclopentapyrimidinol core, 28 remained one
of the most selective compounds we have discovered, while
maintaining good potency against all three Akt isoforms and high
potency in cell-based assays. None of the analogues present in
Tables 2 and 3 oﬀered any signiﬁcant improvement of in vitro
stability and selectivity over 28, so 28 was advanced into
additional proﬁling. As with the corresponding dihydrocyclo-
pentapyrimidine (3), 28 is also predicted to have a high free-drug
fraction in plasma for both human and preclinical species with
39% human plasma protein binding and 44% measured in
monkey and 56% in mouse. Consistent with the plasma protein
binding results, the solubility of 28 was very high, being greater
than 10 mg/mL at three pH values (1.2, 6.5, and 7.4). 28 also
possessed low to moderate predicted in vitro clearance in human,
monkey, and mouse hepatocytes (8, 27, and 8 mL/min/kg,
respectively).
In keeping with observations with other ATP-competitive Akt
inhibitors,18−21 there is an increase of phosphorylated Akt levels
when cells are treated with 28.22 However, the data in Table 1
clearly show that 28 potently inhibits Akt signaling in LNCaP
cells (which have a high basal pAkt level due to loss of PTEN),
indicating that the increased level of phosphorylated Akt is not
functionally active in these cells.22 Additionally, 28 has a potent
antiproliferative eﬀect on this cell line with an IC50 of 95 ± 16

nM. We extended this analysis to other cell lines, including PC3,
MCF7-neo/HER2, and BT474M1. In all three lines, 28 was able
to inhibit overall viability with IC50 values in the range of 1−4
μM. More detailed analysis demonstrated that 28 induces a dose-
dependent block of the cell-cycle progression at the G1 phase
and a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis and
necrosis in MCF7-neo/HER2 and BT474M1 cells (data not
shown; a more complete discussion of these studies will be
presented elsewhere). All four of the cell
lines tested have
elevated levels of basal Akt signaling due to loss of PTEN (PC3
and LNCaP), mutation of PI3Kα (MCF7-neo/HER2), or
overexpression of Her2 (MCF7-neo/HER2 and BT474M1).
Thus, the inhibition of signaling and reduced viability suggest
that 28 will be useful in controlling human cancers in which
PI3K/Akt signaling is overly active. 28 was able to inhibit
phosphorylation of PRAS40 in all four of these cells lines with
IC50 values comparable to that observed in LNCaP cells (ca. 200
nM, data not shown).

fashion with increasing dose,

PK studies of 28 in nu/nu mice were performed to support
pharmacodynamic and eﬃcacy studies. The animals were given a
single per os (po) dose of 28 at 12.5 and 50 mg/kg (0.5%
methylcellulose with 0.2% polysorbate 80 (MCT) dose
solutions). Systemic exposure increased in a more than dose-
proportional
leading to good
exposures. Plasma concentrations were at or above 200 nM for
the 12.5 and 50 mg/kg dose groups, respectively, within 1 h of
drug administration. With the 50 mg/kg po dose, plasma
concentrations were approximately 7.4 μM at 1 h postdose and
0.5 μM at 9 h postdose; the concentration of 28 was above 200
nM for approximately 9 h (this concentration is higher than the
cellular IC50 for p-PRAS40 knockdown in LNCaP cells; see
Table 1). PK studies performed in rat and monkey also gave

acceptable oral exposures (data not shown), suggesting that
reasonable oral exposures in humans can be achieved.

A pharmacodynamic (PD) and PK study was performed in
nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous PC3 prostate tumors to
correlate plasma drug levels of 28 with PD changes in the tumors.
Following administration of a single po dose, plasma and tumor
samples were collected from the animals between 1 and 24 h for
PK and PD analysis, respectively. As described above, robust Akt
pathway inhibition with 28 was determined in vitro on the basis
of the suppression of p-PRAS40. Therefore, this PD marker
relative to the total protein level was also evaluated in vivo.
Within 3 h of drug administration, there was a dose-dependent
decrease in the ratio of p-PRAS40 to tPRAS40 compared with
vehicle controls, with a >95% reduction achieved at 100 mg/kg
(Figure 4A). At 8 h postdose, plasma levels of 28 of >2.6 μM

to be 25 mg/kg. The maximum tumor growth inhibition was
obtained with qd dosing of 28 for 11 days at 100 mg/kg (79%, p <
0.0001). In addition, half-maximal doses of 28 (50 mg/kg) given
orally bid resulted in a nearly equivalent tumor growth inhibition
of 81% when compared with qd dosing of 100 mg/kg (Figure 5,
not statistically diﬀerent). Thus, 28 is eﬃcacious against human
PC3 prostate cancer xenografts in vivo when dosed orally either
qd or bid. Overall body weight loss, including the vehicle control
group, was observed in all groups tested due to the cachexic
nature of this model.23 Doses of 0−100 mg/kg 28 qd caused less
than 10% mean body weight loss, whereas doses of 150 mg/kg qd
caused ≥20% loss of original body weight after eight doses, and
the mice had to be euthanized before the completion of the study
(data not shown).

■ CONCLUSIONS

We have described the discovery of 28, and related compounds,
for the treatment of human tumors. The novel ATP-competitive,
selective Akt
inhibitors were optimized via structure-based
design to target unique features of the Akt ATP binding cleft,
resulting in exquisitely selective and potent inhibitors. In the
speciﬁc case of 28, this strategy led to good selectivity in a 230-
enzyme kinase panel. Extensive in vitro proﬁling has shown that
human cancer cell
lines in which the PI3K/Akt pathway is
upregulated are sensitive to inhibition by 28; in spite of an
increase in pAkt levels, downstream signaling in this pathway is
inhibited by 28, providing a mechanistic explanation of the
antiproliferative and antisurvival eﬀects. The in vitro eﬀects are
recapitulated in the in vivo models, wherein we see good oral
exposures, a signiﬁcant inhibition of Akt signaling following a
single dose of 28, and a robust inhibition of tumor growth
following repeated qd or bid oral dosing in a mouse xenograft
model of PI3K/Akt-driven cancer. Given all of these data, 28 is
currently being investigated in human clinic trials for the
treatment of cancers driven by aberrant PI3K/Akt signaling.

87% inhibition of p-PRAS40/tPRAS40 (Figure 4B). Further-
more, pS6RP is also signiﬁcantly reduced under these conditions
(data not shown). These data demonstrate that 28 is able to
signiﬁcantly inhibit the Akt pathway in PC3 prostate tumors for
at least 8 h postdose at 100 mg/kg.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Enzymatic Assays. The assay for the determination of Akt1/2/3
and PKA kinase activity employs the IMAP ﬂuorescence polarization
(FP) phosphorylation detection reagent (IMAP Screening Express Kit,
catalog no. R8073, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) to detect
ﬂuorescently labeled peptide substrates that have been phosphorylated
by the respective kinases. The Akt enzymes employed in these studies
consisted of recombinant baculovirus expressed, amino-terminal,
polyhistidine-tagged,
full-length, wild-type human forms (GenBank
accession numbers M63167, NP_001617, and NP_005456) and were
obtained from Millipore (Akt1, catalog no. 14 276, lot no. D8MN034U;
Dundee, Scotland) or Invitrogen (Akt2, catalog no. PV3184, lot no.
28770P; Akt3, catalog no. PV3185, lot no. 28771K; Madison, WI). The
PKA enzyme employed in these studies consisted of the recombinant
untagged human isolated catalytic subunit of PKA (GenBank accession
number X07767) expressed in Escherichia coli obtained from Invitrogen
(catalog no. 14-440, lot no. 26698U). Inhibitor, enzyme (9 nM Akt1 or
100 pM PKA), and substrate (100 nM Crosstide, catalog no. R7110,
Molecular Devices) were incubated with 5 μM ATP in assay buﬀer (10
mM Tris−HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA (w/v), ﬁnal DMSO
2% (v/v)) for 60 min at ambient temperature in a 5 μL reaction volume.
Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme + peptide substrate to
ATP solutions. IMAP binding reagent (15 μL) was added to terminate
the reaction, and the stopped reactions were incubated for a minimum of
30 min at room temperature (rt).

Cellular Assays. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr246 was
measured in situ in LNCaP cells (American Type Culture Collection,
catalog no. CRL-1740). The cells were plated in 96-well plates (Grenier,
catalog no. 655946) at a density of 20 000 cells/well and incubated for
16−24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were treated with 0−25 μM
inhibitor for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Medium above the cells was removed, and
each well was supplemented with ﬁxation solution (3.7% (v/v)
formaldehyde in phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS)) for 20 min at rt.
The cells were permeabilized with a 10 min exposure to 100% methanol
(−20 °C) and subsequently rehydrated in PBS and blocked in blocking
buﬀer (catalog no. 927-40000, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE) for 60 min at
rt. A primary antibody solution consisting of an antibody speciﬁc for
Thr246-phosphorylated PRAS40 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:500
dilution, catalog no. AS1011, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and a signal-
normalizing antibody against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogen-
ase (GAPDH; mouse monoclonal, 1 μg/mL ﬁnal concentration, catalog
no. RDI-TRK5-6C5, Fitzgerald Industries Inc., Concord, MA) in
blocking buﬀer was applied to each of the wells and incubated overnight
at 4 °C. The wells were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v)
Tween-20, treated with a secondary antibody solution containing
ﬂuorophore-conjugated antibodies speciﬁc for rabbit (Alexa680
ﬂuorophore-conjugated goat antirabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG),
catalog no. AS21109,
Invitrogen) and mouse IgG (IRDye800
ﬂuorophore-conjugated goat antimouse IgG, catalog no. 610-132-121,
Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), and incubated for 1 h at rt. The wells
were washed in PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and then imaged and
quantiﬁed on an LI-COR Aerius imager (LI-COR Inc.). The phospho-
PRAS40 signal was normalized to the GAPDH signal to control for well-
to-well variation in cell number.

Inhibition of cellular viability was measured in LNCaP cells
(American Type Culture Collection, catalog no. CRL-1740) plated in
black, clear-bottomed 96-well plates (Grenier, catalog no. 655946) at a
density of 5000 cells/well and subsequently treated with 0−10 μM 28
for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The extent of cell proliferation was
determined by measuring the reduction of resazurin to resoruﬁn as
described in the manufacturer’s protocol (CellTiterBlue Cell Viability
Determination Kit, catalog no. G8082, Promega, Madison, WI) using an
excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm.
Dose−response curves were generated using the four-parameter logistic
model, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined
from these curve ﬁts.

Inhibition of cellular proliferation was measured in PC3-NCI, MCF7-
neo/HER2-neo/Her2, and BT474M1 cells plated in black, clear-
bottomed 384-well plates (catalog no. 353962, Becton Dickinson,

Article

Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 1500 cells/well and incubated
overnight to 1.5 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Serial dilutions of inhibitor
were added to the cells, which were then incubated for another 96 h. Cell
viability was determined by measuring the cellular ATP levels as
described in the manufacturer’s protocol (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay Kit, catalog no. G7573, Promega, Madison, WI).
Dose−response curves were generated using the four-parameter logistic
model, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined
from these curve ﬁts.

In Vivo Eﬃcacy and PK/PD. For in vivo tumor xenograft studies,
female nu/nu (nude) mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right
hind ﬂank with PC3 cells suspended in Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS). When tumors reached a mean volume of 150 mm3, the animals
were size matched and distributed into treatment groups consisting of
10 animals/group. Tumor volume was calculated as follows: tumor size
(mm3) = (longer measurement × (shorter measurement)2) × 0.5.
Following data analysis, p values were determined using Dunnett’s t test
with JMP statistical software, version 7.0 (SAS Institute). Mouse body
weights were recorded twice weekly using an Adventura Pro AV812
scale (Ohaus Corp.). Mice were promptly euthanized when the tumor
volume exceeded 2000 mm3 or if body weight loss was ≥20% of the
starting weight per IACUC protocol guidelines.

For PK/PD studies, blood and tumor samples were collected at 1, 3,
8, and 24 h after a single dose of 28 from PC3 tumor bearing mice. Blood
samples (approximately 800 μL) were collected from each animal at the
scheduled sample collection time by terminal cardiac puncture into
tubes containing K2EDTA as an anticoagulant and centrifuged at 1500−
2000g to isolate plasma. The concentration of 28 in each plasma sample
was determined by a nonvalidated LC/MS/MS assay in the DMPK
Bioanalytical Department at Genentech. The assay lower limit of
quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.005 μM. Tumor samples were dissociated
in Tris lysis buﬀer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (Meso Scale Discovery;
Gaithersburg, MD). Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The Invitrogen
(Camarillo, CA) human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits were used to determine the levels of total PRAS40 and
PRAS40 phosphorylated at Thr246 (p-PRAS40). The assay quantiﬁes
protein levels on the basis of measurements of absorbance. The colored
product is directly proportional to the concentration of p-PRAS40 and
tPRAS40 present in the specimen. The Meso Scale Discovery Multi-
Spot Biomarker Detection System (Meso Scale Discovery) was used to
determine the levels of total S6RP and S6RP phosphorylated at Ser235/
236 (pS6RP). These assays quantify protein levels on the basis of
measurements of electrochemiluminescence intensity. Levels of
phosphorylated protein were normalized to total protein levels in 28-
treated tumors and compared to the vehicle control.

Chemistry. All reaction reagents and solvents (anhydrous grade)
were purchased and used without further puriﬁcation. 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 instrument. Chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million relative to an internal standard of TMS in
CDCl3 or DMSO-d6. HPLC analysis was conducted according to

(2R)-Ethyl 2-Methyl-5-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate (5a). To a 5 L
round-bottom ﬂask were added (R)-pulegone (600.0 g, 3.94 mol),
anhydrous NaHCO3 (165.0 g, 1.97 mol), and ether (2.0 L). The mixture
was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath, and bromine (206.0 mL, 4.02 mol)
was added dropwise over 1 h. The reaction was allowed to stir for an
additional 30 min after bromine addition was complete, and the mixture
was ﬁltered to give ﬁltrate A. To a separate 12 L round-bottom reactor
equipped with a mechanical stirrere and a thermocouple were charged
21% NaOEt (3.2 L, 8.7 mol) and EtOH (2.0 L). This reaction mixture
was cooled to 0 °C, and ﬁltrate A was added dropwise at a rate which
maintained an internal temperature below 40 °C. Caution: Addition is
exothermic, and adequate cooling is required! After complete addition of
ﬁltrate A, the reaction was allowed to warm to rt. The reaction was
quenched by the addition of 1 N HCl (1.0 L) and water (1.5 L), followed
by the addition of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE; 1.0 L). The organic
layer was separated and the aqueous phase extracted with MTBE (3 ×
1.5 L). The combined organic layers were concentrated to give a brown
oil. To a second 12 L round-bottom reactor equipped with a mechanical
stirrer were charged semicarbazide hydrochloride (300.0 g, 2.6 mol),
NaOAc (300.0 g, 3.6 mol), and water (3.0 L). The crude oil from above
was added slowly as a solution in ethanol (1.5 L). The mixture was then
reﬂuxed for 3 h and stirred at rt overnight. The mixture was treated with
water (1.0 L) and MTBE (1.0 L). The organic layer was separated, and
the aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (3 × 1.5 L). The combined
organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated to give a brown
oil. The oil was distilled under vacuum to give (2R)-ethyl 2-methyl-5-
propan-2-ylidenecyclopentanecarboxylate (497 g, 64% yield) collected

A solution of (2R)-ethyl 2-methyl-5-propan-2-ylidenecyclopentane-
carboxylate (220.0 g, 1.1 mmol) in EtOAc (1.0 L) was cooled to −78 °C
using a dry ice/2-propanol bath. Ozone was bubbled into the reaction
mixture until it turned purple in color. At this point ozone generation
was stopped, and the reaction mixture was removed from the dry ice
bath. Nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction solution until it turned
yellow. The reaction was concentrated and the resulting residue
dissolved in glacial acetic acid (200 mL). The solution was cooled to 0
°C, and zinc dust (113.0 g, 1.7 mol) was added in small portions over a
30 min period. The reaction was allowed to stir for 1.5 h, at which point
the reaction mixture was ﬁltered through Celite. The resulting solution
was concentrated in vacuo to remove acetic acid, and the residue was
diluted with MTBE (500 mL). The mixture was neutralized to pH 7.0 by
careful addition of aqueous 6 N NaOH. The organic layer was separated,
and the aqueous layer was extracted with MTBE (2 × 250 mL). The
combined organics were washed with brine, dried with solid MgSO4, and
concentrated by rotary evaporation to give a dark brown liquid. This
liquid was passed through a plug of silica gel eluting with a small amount
of MTBE. The combined ﬁltrate was again concentrated by rotary
evaporation to give the desired (2R)-ethyl 2-methyl-5-oxocyclopenta-

equipped with a condenser and thermocouple were added (R)-ethyl 2-
amino-5-methylcyclopent-1-enecarboxylate (308.0 g, 1.8 mol), ammo-
nium formate (172.0 g, 2.7 mol), and formamide (504 mL, 12.7 mol).
The mixture was heated to an internal temperature of 150 °C for 24 h.
Note: Sublimed ammonium formate could build up in the condenser.
Addition of 25 mL of a lower boiling solvent such as o-xylene helps keep the
condenser clear. The reaction mixture was cooled and transferred to 2 L
single-neck ﬂask, and the excess formamide was removed by distillation
under vacuum. Once removal of the formamide was complete, the ﬂask
was cooled, and the resulting oil was dissolved in DCM (2.0 L) and
washed with brine (3 × 200 mL). The organic layer was dried over
Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting
brown oil was dissolved in a small amount of DCM and slowly added to
a stirring solution of ether (ca. 5× volume of ether vs DCM), resulting in
a brown slurry. The slurry was ﬁltered, and the resulting wet cake was
rinsed with ether. The brown ﬁltrate was concentrated by rotary
evaporation and dried under high vacuum to give crude (R)-5-methyl-
6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-ol (180.1 g, 66% yield). This

Tertiary Amines and tert-Butylamines. (S)-2-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-(4-
ﬂuoropiperidin-1-yl)-1-(4-((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-
5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propan-1-one (40). A
solution of 4-ﬂuoropiperidine hydrochloride (1.065 g, 7.629 mmol) in
THF (10 mL) was treated with TEA (1.134 mL, 8.137 mmol) followed
by the addition of methyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)acrylate (57a; 1.000 g,
5.086 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 48 h. The
reaction was diluted with EtOAc, washed with NaHCO3 and brine, dried
over MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated to give methyl 2-(4-
chlorophenyl)-3-(4-ﬂuoropiperidin-1-yl)propanoate (1.521 g, 100%
yield): 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ 7.31−7.23 (m, 4H), 4.73−4.66
(m, 0.5H), 4.60−4.54 (m, 0.5H), 3.83−3.77 (dd, 1H), 3.68 (s, 3H),
3.15−3.07 (dd, 1H), 2.73−2.64 (m, 1H), 2.62−2.43 (m, 3H), 2.40−
2.32 (m, 1H), 1.92−1.75 (m, 4H); LC/MS APCI (+) m/z 300.1 (M +
H)+.

To a solution of methyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-ﬂuoropiperidin-1-
yl)propanoate (0.380 g, 1.27 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added
KO(TMS) (0.199 g, 1.39 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt
overnight. Additional KO(TMS) (20 mg) was added. The reaction was
concentrated, and the crude product (0.232 g, 0.716 mmol) was added
to a solution of 12b (0.200 g, 0.651 mmol) in DCM (4 mL). DIEA
(0.363 mL, 2.08 mmol) and HBTU (0.272 g, 0.716 mmol) were added
to the reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred at rt overnight and then
partitioned between DCM and saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layer
was extracted with DCM. The combined extracts were washed with
brine, dried over MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated. The residue was
puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography (12:1 DCM−MeOH) to
give the 1:1 mixture of diastereomers, which was separated by chiral SFC
to give (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-ﬂuoropiperidin-1-yl)-1-(4-
((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]-
