Abstract

Benign neurofibromas, the main phenotypic manifestations of the rare neurological disorder
neurofibromatosis type 1, degenerate to malignant tumors associated to poor prognosis in
about 10% of patients. Despite efforts in the field of (epi)genomics, the lack of prognostic
biomarkers with which to predict disease evolution frustrates the adoption of appropriate
early therapeutic measures. To identify potential biomarkers of malignant neurofibroma
transformation, we integrated four human experimental studies and one for mouse, using a
gene score-based meta-analysis method, from which we obtained a score-ranked signature
of 579 genes. Genes with the highest absolute scores were classified as promising disease
biomarkers. By grouping genes with similar neurofibromatosis-related profiles, we derived
panels of potential biomarkers. The addition of promoter methylation data to gene profiles
indicated a panel of genes probably silenced by hypermethylation. To identify possible ther-
apeutic treatments, we used the gene signature to query drug expression databases. Tri-
chostatin A and other histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as cantharidin and tamoxifen,
were retrieved as putative therapeutic means to reverse the aberrant regulation that drives
to malignant cell proliferation and metastasis. This in silico prediction corroborated reported
experimental results that suggested the inclusion of these compounds in clinical trials. This
experimental validation supported the suitability of the meta-analysis method used to inte-
grate several sources of public genomic information, and the reliability of the gene signature
associated to the malignant evolution of neurofibromas to generate working hypotheses for
prognostic and drug-responsive biomarkers or therapeutic measures, thus showing the
potential of this in silico approach for biomarker discovery.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

suppressor gene neurofibromin (NF1) enhance expression of the Ras signaling pathway, which
is involved in the evolution of many cancers [2]. Patients develop various anomalies in skin,
eyes and skeleton, as well as in the cardiovascular, endocrine and nervous systems. In the
peripheral nervous system, disorders typically manifest as benign neurofibromas (NF). Dermal
neurofibromas (dNF) arise from small cutaneous nerves, whereas plexiform neurofibromas
(pNF) have a deeper location within larger nerves; dNF and pNF gene expression patterns
are indistinguishable [3]. In ~10% of NF1 patients, pNF can degenerate to malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). About 50% of MPNST cases associate to NF1 disease,
whereas the other 50% appear sporadically. Whether there are significant biological differences
between sporadic and NF1-associated MPNST cases is debated [4–7].

The likelihood of MPNST development in NF1 patients depends on several risk factors [8],
and appropriate prediction of pNF evolution would help to stratify patients and to choose the
best early treatment. Despite recent advances based on studies of concomitant alterations in
genes other than NF1, gene copy number alteration, epigenetic changes and gene expression,
no prognostic biomarkers are available. Unlike other types of sarcoma, MPNST show a wide
spectrum of chromosomal alterations [9]. In both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNST,
amplifications are more frequent than deletions and affect the distal part of chromosome arm
17q [10]. Deletions mainly involve band p21 of chromosome 9, thus driving a dose reduction
of the kinase inhibitor CDKN2A [11], and the proximal part of 17q, where NF1 appears to be
co-deleted with SUZ12, which encodes a member of the epigenetic regulator polycomb repres-
sor complex 2 (PRC2). Genetic modifications due to PRC2 silencing are suggested as biomark-
ers for NF1 patient stratification [12].

Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes are epige-

netic changes reported for most cancers. A whole-methylome analysis identified 3690 genes
probably associated with MPNST development and progression; among these were genes that
encode CDKN2A and the tumor suppressors SOX10 and RASSF1, a Ras association domain
family member [13]. RASSF1A silencing by promoter methylation is a biomarker of NF1-asso-
ciated MPNST patients with poor prognosis [14].

Genome-wide RNA expression studies encompass patient samples [3,6,10,15,16], human
cell cultures including NF- and MPNST-derived cell lines [1,3], and mouse models [17] that
replicate human NF histology [18]. Gene expression profiles serve to identify disease biomark-
ers, such as BIRC5, TOP2A and TK1, that categorize MPNST patients with poor prognosis
after surgery [10], or might also help to identify new therapeutic agents through drug reposi-
tioning, i.e., use of tested drugs to treat new disease indications [19]. NFFinder and other bio-
informatics tools compare gene signatures to seek potential repurposing medicines in the
context of orphan diseases [20]. Although a unique average gene signature associated to
changes from NF to MPNST would be desirable as input for NFFinder, differences in sample
nature, array platforms, and hybridization protocols hamper direct comparison of results
among studies, which explains the current lack of attention to genomic data integration in
neurofibromatosis.

The combination of data from public databases such as the Gene Expression Omnibus

(GEO) and ArrayExpress [21,22] and development of high-throughput technologies has led
generalization of data integration by meta-analysis in genomic research. By using statistical
tools to combine independent studies, microarray meta-analysis approaches extract consistent
average gene expression signatures as well as interaction networks [23]. Robust, unsupervised
meta-analysis approaches are currently being developed based on projections of high-di-
mensional data into a low-dimensional space to infer dependency among data [24]. These
approaches nonetheless require a relatively large sample number [25] and connections among
the different -omics data, which precludes their use in studies for which information is limited.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

Combining pre-calculated values (P-values and effect sizes) led to a useful method to integrate
heterogeneous data, qualitative and quantitative, for analysis of diabetes mellitus and Down
syndrome [23,26]. This method, based on adding a score determined for each gene in each
experiment using a formula similar to that applied in correlation studies, weights the size of
the effect with reproducibility for all sample replicates and the statistical significance of the dif-
ferentially expressed genes. As a starting point to identify biomarkers in the context of neurofi-
bromatosis, we used a slight modification of this formula to integrate public genomic data and
obtained a robust ranked score gene signature associated to the NF transition to MPNST.

Results
Experimental sets used to define the gene expression signature
associated to NF-to-MPNST transition

To define a unique MPNST vs. NF gene signature that integrates data from diverse expression
studies, we sought cited accessions in GEO and ArrayExpress databases that include MPNST
and NF samples, and found five microarray studies (four human and one murine). These stud-
ies are referenced in Fig 1 and the heterogeneity of these data sets is detailed in Table 1 (bold).
Despite the different number of genes represented by each microarray platform, all of them
satisfied the selection criteria, segregated properly NF and MPNST samples, and supported
relevant works that identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets [3,10,16,17] or
discriminated neurofibromas and MPNST from other mesenchymal tumors [15]. Based on
expression profile similarity [3], we grouped dNF and pNF samples from studies E-TABM-69,
GSE41747 (human) and GSE66743, respectively. We also grouped segregated sporadic and
NF1-associated MPNST samples from the GSE66743 study, as there were no differentially ex-
pressed genes between samples [10]. The final number of MPNST and NF samples compared

MPNST vs. NF gene expression signature

To integrate the five data sets, we calculated a score for each gene in each experiment (Fig 2,
Microarray processing, and S1 Table), based on a formula used to combine data from hetero-
geneous sources [23]. To obtain a single score (si) for each gene, we added individual scores
(sij) across human and mouse data sets (Fig 2, Meta-analysis). The final MPNST vs. NF gene
signature contained 579 unique ENSEMBL human genes with non-null score and absolute
median logFC value >0.99. The 336 up- and 243 downregulated genes included in this signa-
ture are highlighted in Table A in S2 Table (bold), embedded in the larger list from which the
gene signature was filtered. The list includes the starting 7064 unique ENSEMBL human genes
(4059 up- and 3005 downregulated) with non-null score in at least one independent study for
which sij was computed. The comparison of non-null score profiles of this unfiltered integra-
tive gene list and the lists derived from each individual study revealed comparable and overlap-
ping patterns of gene scores (S1 Fig). Genes with the highest absolute scores in each study
were at both ends of the unfiltered list, and were thus included in the final gene signature.
However, some mice genes showed opposite behavior to that set in human, which corrobo-
rated differences in transcriptional responses between human and mouse models, particularly
in neurodegenerative diseases [27]. Given the difficulty of interspecies comparison of results,
we restricted the number of murine genes used to compute final scores (for score computation
details, see Materials and methods).

The most promising biomarkers, 20 up- and 20 downregulated genes with the highest and

the lowest score values from the MPNST vs. NF signature, were extracted from Table A in S2
Table (Table 2). In addition to gene score values, we determined attributes for estimating the rele-
vance of each gene in the list, such as the median value of effect size, computed regarding the
mean (logFC) or the median (logFC_m) across studies, as well as to assess the bias across the stud-
ies, like the number of studies in which each gene is represented, the inclusion or exclusion of

Rasche et al. [23] as an estimator of the homogenous contribution of each study to the final score
(see Materials and methods) (Table A in S2 Table). The relationships between gene scores and
additional attributes (Results A in S1 Appendix) and the final contribution of each individual
experiment to the gene signature (Results B in S1 Appendix) are also evaluated.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

In silico search for therapeutic drugs to reverse malignant phenotype

Analysis of similar or opposite gene signatures is one of the most important applications of
gene signatures for generating hypotheses for the study of NF1 and other rare diseases. We
used NFFinder [20] to explore repurposing of drugs that might reverse the NF1-associated
MPNST malignant phenotype by inspecting CMap and DrugMatrix databases for gene expres-
sion patterns opposite to the MPNST vs. NF gene signature (Fig 2, NFFinder processing). The
complete score-ranked list of drugs with pval <0.005 can be seen at goo.gl/IdyV1N; Table A in
S3 Table shows the first 50 drug entries retrieved. In the top two positions was Entinostat MS-
275, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor selective for class I HDAC. The non-specific
HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) appeared in 39 of the top 50 entries retrieved. Two
other HDAC inhibitors, the class I-selective HC-toxin and the non-specific HDAC inhibitor
Scriptaid, were also on the shortlist. Other anti-cancer compounds were rifabutin, an antibi-
otic effective against lung cancer cells, PNU-0251126, which correlated positively with drugs
for leukemia treatment, the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor cantharidin, which induces cell
death, the anti-inflammatory steroid medrysone, the topoisomerase II inhibitor ellipticine, a
potent antineoplastic agent, and the non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator
tamoxifen, used to treat ER-positive breast cancer. To identify conditions similar to the NF-to-
MPNST transformation that might share therapeutic treatments, we used NFFinder to search
for disease gene signatures from GEO experiments with expression patterns resembling the
MPNST vs. NF gene signature; results are shown in goo.gl/36xlB1 and the first 50 GEO studies
are summarized in Table B in S3 Table. The most similar diseases were other types of cancer
(58%), of which 73% were solid tumors, especially in prostate and breast, 20% were leukemias
and lymphomas, and 7%, tumor cell lines. We also found premalignant neoplasias of epithelial
tissue in endometrium and kidney (12%), lipid metabolism conditions (6%), pulmonary dis-
eases (4%), muscular dystrophy (4%) and neuronal conditions (2%).

The experimental validation of the therapeutic effectiveness of drugs retrieved by NFFinder
to treat NF1-associated MPNST was reported for HDAC inhibitors [28], cantharidin [29] and
tamoxifen [30], and clinical trials have been suggested for all of them. The conclusion of our
in-silico workflow (Fig 2) with these experimental data confirms the predictive value of the
MPNST vs. NF gene signature and its usefulness to identify robust biomarkers and therapeutic
agents in neurofibromatosis disease.

Functional characterization of the MPNST vs. NF gene signature

We provide detailed lists of GO term enrichment of MPNST vs. NF up- and downregulated
genes (Tables A to F in S4 Table), as well as over-represented pathways derived by analysis of
KEGG (Tables G and H), Wiki (Tables I and J), and Reactome (Tables K and L) databases.
Results C in S1 Appendix details genes in the pathways identified.

For upregulated genes, DNA replication and cell cycle pathways were shared in the three
pathway databases; 70% of GO terms associated to these genes were thus involved mainly in
processes that underlie positive regulation of cell proliferation, mitosis and meiosis. We also
found terms related to morphogenesis and development of skeletal, nervous, cardiovascular
and digestive systems. GO terms directly related to malignancy of proliferating cells included
collagen catabolic process, which can affect extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, a process
involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. The KEGG ECM-
receptor interaction pathway was also over-represented, which supports this observation. In
accordance with GO terms and pathways, components from nucleus and cytoplasm were asso-
ciated predominantly with upregulated genes.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

For the downregulated genes, all three pathway databases identified the immunity pathway
linked to complement activation, including regulatory elements and complement components.
Downregulated genes also appeared to control peripheral nervous system development, particu-
larly via myelination and axonogenesis. Other downregulated genes participated in the response
to steroid hormones and in cell migration, chemotaxis, and cell adhesion to another cell or to a
substrate such as the ECM. Unlike upregulated genes, downregulated genes accumulated GO
terms related to plasma membrane and its intrinsic components, including elements from pro-
teinaceous ECM involved in cell junction formation. When we analyzed the unfiltered list of 3005
downregulated genes, from which we derived the MPNST vs. NF downregulated gene signature,
we found that specific KEGG pathways in cancer were over-represented (Table P in S4 Table).

In accordance with this functional characterization, most upregulated genes from Table 2
are involved in cell cycle progression, have been linked with carcinogenic processes in which
they are upregulated, and many have also been described as diagnostic biomarkers (S5 and S6
Tables). HMGA2 is the only gene product that is an architectural transcription factor, although
some other genes act as regulatory elements in mitosis, especially cyclins CCNB2, CCNB1, and
kinase CDK1. As anticipated, and in contrast to the mitosis-related products of upregulated
genes, which were found mainly in nucleus and cytoskeleton, the 20 most-downregulated gene
products (Table 2) act mainly in the extracellular space. Whereas upregulated genes are over-
expressed in cancer, some downregulated genes can be silenced or overexpressed, and thus
have dual roles in cancer, as tumor suppressors or cell proliferation promoters. Some of these
genes appear to be involved in signal transduction and development in the nervous system
(PLEKHB1, SOX10, CHL1, PTGDS), in maintenance of structural integrity of cells and tissues,
e.g., ECM formation or myelin synthesis (CRYAB, CBX7, GSN, MAL, TNXB, CDH19, PMP2,
ANGPTL7, ADIRF), or to have various roles in the immune response (ENDOD1, P2RY14,
FGL2, S100B). SOX10 and S100B coregulate Schwann cell proliferation and myelination [31].
CBX7 is involved in epigenetic transcriptional repression. The metabolic proteins ASPA and
ADH1B are also in the most-downregulated group. ASPA participates in increasing the pool
of acetate, an essential precursor for histone acetylation reactions. ADH1B oxidizes alcohol,
thus also helping to generate acetate precursors, as well as retinol, an early step in synthesis of
retinoic acid, a basic molecule in epithelial tissue growth and differentiation.

Chromosome distribution of genes in the MPNST vs. NF signature

To establish whether there are significant distribution differences in human chromosomes for
genes in the MNPST vs. NF signature (336 up- and 243 downregulated genes), we computed
frequencies of the number of genes per chromosome arm from the gene signature and the
whole human genome (Fig 3). Upregulated genes accumulated significantly in chromosome
arms 4q, 7p, 8q and 17q, whereas downregulated genes were over-represented mainly in 1q,
3p, 5q and 11q. Another binomial distribution identified chromosome bands in which both
up- and downregulated genes were over-represented. The highest concentration of upregu-
lated genes was found in bands 3q25.33 and 15q15.1, with others concentrated in bands 7p15.3
and Xq22.1; the largest number of bands with over-representation of upregulated genes was
seen in arm 15q and the distal part of 17q. The highest significant concentration of downregu-
lated genes was found in bands 1q24.3 and 19q13.12; arm 1q showed the largest number of
over-represented bands. The function of genes in over-represented chromosome regions is
shown in S7 Table. Enrichment in GO biological process terms coincided with the functions
of up- and downregulated genes in the MPNST vs. NF signature, as described above.

Comparison of chromosome region enrichment from the MPNST vs. NF gene signature

with that in S2 Fig for the unfiltered gene list indicated some shared over-represented regions;

chromosome arms 7p, 8q and 17q accumulated upregulated genes on the unfiltered list,
whereas arms 3p and 11q concentrated downregulated genes. The distal part of chromosome
arm 17q showed the largest number of over-represented bands. In addition, the unfiltered list
showed over-represented upregulated genes in arms 1q, 2p, 2q, 6p, 7q, 19p and Xq, and down-
regulated genes in 1p, 9q, 10q, 14q, 17p and 20p.

genes with positive score (a), and from the 243 genes with negative score (b). Bar diagrams compare the observed distribution of MPNST
vs. NF gene percentage in the human chromosome arms (dark bars) with the expected distribution according to the human ENSEMBL
database (light bars). Statistical significance of the gene signature over-represented chromosome arms is above the bars. Over-represented
human chromosome bands in the MPNST vs. NF gene signature are shown below each chart. Their statistical significance is shown at the

Panels of biomarkers with similar expression profiles in the context of
NF1 disease

Given the greater potential prognostic capacity of biomarker panels compared to individual
biomarkers, we built robust gene profiles to group functionally related genes with similar
expression patterns. To obtain gene profiles, we extended the gene score methodology to iden-
tify other average gene signatures in the NF1 context. We performed five additional differential
expression analyses; Table 1 groups the accession numbers of the studies used to determine
gene signatures for the five new comparisons. Two of these new comparisons involved nerve
tumors, whereas the other three comprised cell cultures. For tumor tissue, we carried out two
meta-analyses that integrated human and mouse nerve tumors by comparing NF vs. control
(nerve tissue) and MPNST vs. control. For cell cultures, we made three comparisons. Only the
comparison of MPNST cell lines vs. control (NHSC; normal human Schwann cells) integrated
data from two studies; for the other two comparisons, primary NFSC (neurofibroma Schwann
cells) vs. control (NHSC) and MPNST cell lines vs. primary NFSC, we used standard differen-
tial expression analyses, as only one study was available. These additional gene signatures were
added as Tables B to J in S2 Table. Their composition, and a comparison with the MPNST vs.
NF gene signature are detailed in Results D in S1 Appendix.

To search for function-related genes in the context of neurofibromatosis, we sought genes

with similar expression patterns in the six comparisons of NF, MPNST and control phenotypes
in cell cultures and nerve tumors; S8 Table shows the list of 2209 genes obtained by gathering
signatures of these comparisons. Comparisons (clustered by tissue type) and genes grouped
independently, and dendrograms were determined of the comparisons and of the genes,
grouped in 46 clusters represented by their self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) centroid
vectors (Fig 4). Divergence between sample tissue types coincided with dissimilarities in the
functional characterization of genes in the cell culture and nerve tumor signatures (Results D
in S1 Appendix). As predicted, the second line of sample divergence separated MPNST sam-
ples (vs. NF or vs. control) from NF vs. control comparisons. Results E in S1 Appendix evalu-
ates gene pattern homogeneity in each cluster.

Although almost every cluster contained genes from the MPNST vs. NF tumor tissue signa-
ture (highlighted in S8 Table), the most populated clusters (>15 genes) appeared in four clus-
ter areas, from which were derived four biomarker panels that included the majority of the 20
most up- and downregulated genes (Fig 4). Cluster 3, which includes genes involved in devel-
opment of the peripheral nervous system, contained six genes of the 20 most-downregulated
(Table 2), CRYAB, SOX10, FGL2, CDH19, PMP2 and S100B; SOX10 and S100B are markers
used to diagnose neural crest-derived tumors [32]. Cluster 17 incorporated three of the most-
downregulated genes, PLEKHB1, GSN and CHL1. Cluster 25 included 153 genes and 181 GO
terms, and thus concentrated the highest functional enrichment. This cluster, with adjacent
clusters 23 and 24, accumulated the majority of genes involved in cell proliferation. Cluster
25 included 17 of the 20 genes with the highest scores from the MPNST vs. NF comparison
(Tables 2 and S8), particularly the genes that encode the putative NF1 prognostic markers
TOP2A and BIRC5 [10]. Finally, cluster 34 contained five of the 20 most-downregulated genes
in the MPNST vs. NF signature, CBX7, P2RY14, TNXB, ADIRF and PTGDS. Details for gene
accumulation in clusters from the MPNST vs. NF signature, and for the five additional signa-
tures, are shown in S3 Fig.

gene expression and aberrant promoter methylation, we associated our six gene expression signa-
tures with the methylation status of gene promoters. In GEO and ArrayExpress databases, we
sought studies that provide raw methylation data relative to NF1 evolution. GEO accession
GSE21714 genome-wide methylome analysis compared immunoprecipitated DNA from 10
pooled MPNST samples, 10 pooled NF samples, and 6 pooled control Schwann cell samples [13];
for the process used to identify methylated promoters, see Materials and methods. The edgeR.
logFC and edgeR.adj.pval (<0.1) values obtained for MPNST vs. NF (Table A in S2 Table),
MPNST vs. control (Table B), and NF vs. control (Table C) methylome comparisons showed 428,
594 and 9 differentially methylated gene promoters, respectively (right columns); most were
hypermethylated. MPNST vs. NF and MPNST vs. control comparisons showed 181 promoters in
common, and MPNST vs. control and NF vs. control Schwann cells indicated 4 shared promoters.
Hypermethylation of the RASSF1A promoter identified a NF1-associated MPNST subgroup
with poor prognosis [14]; we therefore tested RASSF1 promoter methylation status as a control
of our analysis. The RASSF1 promoter was differentially hypermethylated in MPNST vs. NF
and in MPNST vs. control Schwann cells, but not in NF vs. control Schwann cells. To find
other potential regulatory elements with aberrant promoter methylation, we searched for
other downregulated genes with hypermethylated promoters in MPNST vs. NF and MPNST
vs. control Schwann cell comparisons. Using the unfiltered gene lists for all comparisons
(Table J in S2 Table), we selected genes whose expression pattern in tumor tissue included a
negative MPNST vs. NF score, as well as logFC values < -0.5 for MPNST vs. NF and MPNST
vs. control comparisons. Genes selected also showed edgeR.logFC and edgeR.adj.pval pro-
moter methylation values >1.5 and <0.1, respectively. We found 56 gene promoters that fit
these selection conditions. The RASSF1 gene and 9 of the selected genes found in the MPNST
vs. NF gene signature are listed in Table 3; the full list is given in S10 Table.

Discussion
MPNST vs. NF gene expression signature

Here we report the integrative MPNST vs. NF gene signature associated to the NF-to-MPNST
transition in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 disease. For this signature, filtered from a
larger list of all differentially expressed genes from five studies comparing MPNST to NF, we
included genes with the highest scores, size effects and consensus among individual studies,
and used it as a core to study biomarkers and drugs that might control evolution to malignity
in NF1 patients.

The 20 highest and 20 lowest score-ranked genes suggested as promising biomarkers

(Table 2) are all implicated in carcinogenic processes and many are suggested biomarkers.
Among the top 20 genes in the MPNST vs. NF signature are 4 genes reported as induced in
the transition from benign NF to MPNST (S11 Table); their products are the topoisomerase
TOP2A, needed for correct chromosome segregation in mitosis, the apoptosis inhibitor BIRC5,
a member of the mitotic chromosome passenger complex, the architectural transcription regu-
lator HMGA2, and TPX2, which is essential for correct mitotic spindle assembly and activates
the AURKA kinase to control cell cycle progression. Among the 20 most-downregulated genes
are 4 NF- and/or MPNST-associated genes (S12 Table), the transcriptional regulator SOX10,
needed for neural crest multipotent cell and peripheral nervous system development, the extra-
cellular matrix glycoprotein TNXB, the cell-cell adhesion Ca2+-dependent cadherin CDH19,
specific to myelin-forming cells, and the Ca2+-binding S100B, whose inhibition is associated to
MPNST transformation [33].

The NF1 gene, the basic reference of reliability for the gene signature generated, had a null

score and was thus absent from the MPNST vs. NF signature. This suggested that most samples

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

of sporadic MPNST had somatic deactivating NF1 mutations, which corroborates previous
studies [34]. Our results coincide with gene expression data that compare MPNST with benign
NF, although given the strict score threshold, some known MPNST-related genes on the unfil-
tered gene list were lacking in the gene signature, such as SOX9, which encodes a developmen-
tal transcription factor [3], and TNC, which is involved in axon guidance during development
[16]. Other cancer-related genes were absent from the signature for similar reasons, such as
CDH1, which codes for the tumor suppressor cadherin 1. CDH1 silencing is a marker of the
EMT associated to cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis [35].

We found that despite some exceptions, our results for over-represented chromosome
regions in the MPNST vs. NF gene signature corroborated previous data on chromosome
region enrichment. In addition, we identified other regions such as chromosome arm 3p, in
which many downregulated genes are concentrated. A detailed comparison of these regions
and reported aberrant chromosome modifications is shown in Discussion A in S1 Appendix.

Biomarker panels that share NF1-related gene expression profiles

In addition to the study of individual genes as potential biomarkers, tests of groups of genes in
the MPNST vs. NF signature can improve prospects for diagnosis or prognosis. Kolberg et al.
[10] defined a prognostic test for post-tumor resection MPNST patients, based on expression
of three proteins encoded by genes located in the distal part of chromosome 17q (BIRC5, TK1,
TOP2A). These genes were included in a 31-gene cell cycle progression (CCP) signature that is
a robust predictor of clinical outcome for prostate cancer patients [36].

Given the limitation of the MPNST vs. NF score-ranked gene signature for grouping genes
with similar function, we built profiles that integrated other NF1-related signatures. These sig-
natures, obtained from tumor tissue and cultured cells, were based on one or two studies each
and were thus less robust than our original MPNST vs. NF, built from five studies. Genes were
grouped by their profiles using SOTA, which allows hierarchical clustering by a neural net-
work. We obtained a large number of SOTA clusters containing homogeneous groups of func-
tionally related genes that shared similar expression profiles.

Of the upregulated genes in the MPNST vs. NF signature, most grouped to Cluster 25 and
are linked to cell cycle progression. Mechanisms that regulate the complex process of cell cycling
are precisely regulated, and deregulation drives to aberrant cell proliferation and cancer develop-
ment [37]. Not surprisingly, many genes from the CCP signature [38] were included in the cluster
25. Our group of the 20 most-upregulated genes contained 9 of the 31 CCP signature genes
(RRM2, TOP2A, KIAA0101, BIRC5, NUSAP1, CENPF, PRC1, ASPM, DTL), and 14 more CCP
genes were upregulated in the MPNST vs. NF gene signature (FOXM1, TK1, CDC20,BUB1B,
PBK, CDKN3, ASF1B, CEP55, DLGAP5, RAD51, KIF11, KIF20A, PTTG1, CDCA8). Due to its
potential as MPNST biomarker [39], we propose the inclusion of HMGA2 in any similar list built
to interrogate the expression status of genes involved in cell cycle progression in MPNST progno-
sis. A panel from cluster 3 should contain at least CRYAB, SOX10, FGL2, CDH19, PMP2, and
S100B. Cluster 17 genes to be evaluated would be PLEKHB1, GSN and CHL1. A cluster 34 panel
should include at least CBX7, P2RY14, TNXB, ADIRF and PTGDS genes.

The divergence between expression values in comparisons of cell cultures and nerve tumors

indicated clear differences due to the nature of the samples. Many essential characteristics of
cancers in which the ECM plays a fundamental role, such as those involving EMT, invasion
and metastasis, cannot be appropriately mimicked by cultured cells. In contrast to MPNST,
which contain a mixture of different cell types, cultured cells derive from a single cell type. Dif-
ferences between cultured cells and nerve tumors, exemplified by SOX9, SUZ12, EGFR, SPP1
and BMP2 genes, are detailed in Discussion B in S1 Appendix.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

Genes potentially silenced by hypermethylation of their CpG-island
promoter region

To identify potential biomarkers whose expression is inhibited by hypermethylation, we
sought genes that were downregulated and showed promoter hypermethylation in tumor tis-
sue for MPNST vs. NF and MPNST vs. control comparisons; 42% of the differentially methyl-
ated promoters were shared, most of which were hypermethylated. This result correlated with
gene expression data, as more than 58% of genes from the MPNST vs. NF showed similar
behavior in the MPNST vs. control comparison. In addition to the tumor suppressor RASSF1,
whose differential promoter hypermethylation status and expression inhibition are associated
in MPNST and other cancers [14], we found additional regulatory genes. The genes identified
by common expression and methylation patterns were implicated mainly in cancer, which
corroborates the importance of epigenetic changes in the control and evolution of cancerous
processes; they were also linked to immune response, nervous system development, lipid
metabolism, metabolic energy balance and detoxification (S10 Table). Many act as mediators
in signal transduction pathways, have a structural role, or interact with other proteins to con-
trol various biological processes related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. Most genes in the
MPNST vs. NF signature that are potentially silenced by promoter hypermethylation are asso-
ciated with structural functions in the peripheral nervous system (PRIMA1, ST6GALNAC2,
ITGB4, MBP, MPZ) or with signal transduction pathways (RABGAP1L, ACKR1, S100B) (S10
Table, bold). Differentially methylated genes are discussed in detail in Discussion C in S1
Appendix.

From MPNST vs. NF gene signature to working hypotheses:
Therapeutic applications of HDAC inhibitors, cantharidin and tamoxifen

To identify diseases or biological problems similar to malignant NF evolution, or to define
potential therapeutic drugs that could reverse malignant phenotype, we used NFFinder to
compare the MPNST vs. NF signature with similar or contrasting signatures. Gene signatures
in GEO studies most similar to that of MPNST vs. NF were associated with cancer, mainly
solid tumors, followed by other diseases that share several phenotypic alterations with neurofi-
bromatosis. Most signatures in CMap and DrugMatrix databases that contrasted from the
MPNST vs. NF signature indicated that the reported as effective compounds to treat MPNST,
cantharidin and tamoxifen, and especially HDAC inhibitors, could potentially reverse the
malignant phenotype. Our in-silico prediction corroborates these data, which indicates the
reliability of our gene signature as representative of NF evolution to malignancy.

HDAC inhibitors control gene expression by blocking deacetylation of histone and non-

histone proteins. These inhibitors modify the chromatin condensation status [40] and also
control several chromatin structure-independent processes that alter gene expression, such as
transcription factor activity, miRNA expression, and signal transduction [41]. Some HDAC
inhibitors act as epigenetic regulators by modifying the DNA methylation status, which reveals
crosstalk between acetylation and methylation [42]. This ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse
epigenetic aberrations make them effective therapeutic agents in cancer, as well as in neurolog-
ical and immune disorders [43]. In cancer, HDAC inhibitors impair cell proliferation, neoan-
giogenesis and metastasis, and increase differentiation and apoptosis. Blockade of tumor
angiogenesis nonetheless hinders drug delivery and limits the use of these inhibitors for solid
tumors [44]. Combination therapies are thus necessary.

Based on the sensitivity of Ras signaling tumors to HDAC inhibitors, Lo´pez et al. assessed
these compounds in MPNST, both in vitro and in tumor xenografts [28]. The strong reaction
of NF1-associated MPNST cell lines to HDAC inhibitors led the authors to suggest their

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

therapeutic value for inclusion in clinical trials. NFFinder also found that the pan-HDAC
inhibitor TSA can replace the effective combination of synergy-acting compounds PD-901
and JQ1 to kill MPNST cells and shrink tumors [12,20]. Robust biomarkers are nonetheless
needed to predict the effectiveness of TSA and other HDAC inhibitors, alone or in combina-
tion, in clinical trials for treatment of NF1-associated MPNST.

Among the 20 most up- and downregulated, several genes alter their expression in response
to HDAC inhibitors such as the upregulated genes TOP2A, BIRC5, HMGA2, CCNB1, CCNB2,
TPX5 and CDK1 [45–49], and the downregulated genes SOX10 [50] and GSN [51]. As compo-
nents of the epigenetic regulation system, HMGA2 and GSN are main targets of HDAC inhibi-
tors, and suggest their utility as predictive treatment markers.

HMGA2 controls gene transcription directly via chromatin remodeling, or indirectly, by
altering the binding affinity of regulators and nuclear proteins to DNA through protein-pro-
tein interactions. Involved in the control of fetal development, HMGA2 also has a central role
in tumor growth and metastasis. HMGA2 protein levels rise acutely in malignancies [52], and
its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in colon, lung, pancreas, ovary and gastric
cancers [53,54]. Besides use of HMGA2 as a diagnostic/prognostic biomarker in NF progres-
sion to malignity, the reported silencing of HMGA2 with HDAC inhibitors justifies its use as a
biomarker of treatment effectiveness of these drugs [55].

In addition to its structural role as one of the most abundant actin-binding proteins, the

multifunctional regulator gelsolin GSN is involved in apoptosis and regulates processes related
to pathological states such as amyloidosis, inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular
diseases, cancer and aging [56]. In cancer, GSN has a dual effect as a promoter of cell growth
and invasion [57] and as a tumor suppressor that inhibits metastasis. Its tumor suppressor
effect is reported for most cancers, and it is downregulated in all of them [58]. GSN transcrip-
tional repression is associated with epigenetic control through DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation, and addition of HDAC inhibitors increases GSN expression [51], which sup-
ports its use as a biomarker for the effectiveness of MPNST treatment with HDAC inhibitors.

HMGA2 and GSN, as well as EZH2 and CBX7, respective members of PRC2 and PRC1 epi-

genetic repressor complexes, probably impaired during NF malignant transformation, are
involved in the control of cell proliferation and metastatic phenotype by regulation of the
tumor suppressor protein CDH1 and other markers of EMT, whose expression is reversed
after treatment with HDAC inhibitors, particularly TSA [59]. HDAC inhibitor activity coun-
teracts CBX7 silencing and EZH2 protein overexpression over the CDH1 promoter, as dis-
cussed in Discussion D in S1 Appendix.

In addition to genes involved in epigenetic regulation as possible HDAC inhibitor targets,

we found two other genes related to acetate metabolism and availability (ASPA, ADH1B)
among the 20 most-underexpressed genes of the MPNST vs. NF signature. Supplementation
with acetate precursors as coadjuvant chemotherapy to complement two metabolic pathways
that involve ASPA and ADH1B in acetate synthesis is considered in Discussion E in S1
Appendix.

Cantharidin and tamoxifen were also retrieved by NFFinder and confirmed experimentally
as effective drugs to inhibit MPNST cultured cell proliferation and survival. The protein phos-
phatase 2A inhibitor cantharidin was found by screening from a library of 472 small bioactive
compound library [29] and shown to avoid growth of NF1-associated MPNST cultured cells,
though additional studies should clarify the relevance of cantharidin in vivo.

Due to MPNST are not sex steroid hormone sensitive, the ER modulator tamoxifen inhibits

MPNST cultured cell growth independently of ER [30,60]. Combination therapies of tamoxi-
fen and trifluoperazine have shown to be effective on treatment of sporadic and NF1-asso-
ciated MPNST, suggesting the quick repurposing of these drugs for clinical and prophylactic

uses. Tamoxifen, which induces NF1-associated MPNST cell death mediated by autophagy in
a K-Ras degradation dependent-process [61], might replace cloroquine and combine with
HDAC inhibitors to induce apoptosis-oriented autophagy in “resistant” sporadic MPNST cells
[28]. Tamoxifen and HDAC inhibitors might thus boost productive autophagy in a similar
way as the combination of tamoxifen with panobinostat has been proposed for treatment of
other solid tumors like hepatocellular carcinoma [62].

Meta-analysis method to define the MPNST vs. NF gene signature

Various meta-analysis approaches have been developed to integrate data from independent
studies. Due to their inherent difficulties, most meta-analyses restrict the inclusion of studies
to a small number of different platforms or to a single platform. Integration of genomics data
for rare diseases presents even greater challenges. Scanty heterogeneous data, common for rare
diseases, might hide consistent information and patterns potentially present across studies.
The meta-analysis method used here, based on previously described gene scores [23,26], iden-
tifies differentially expressed genes between two conditions, by integrating data from platforms
of distinct size. Although we used a similar formula, our gene score differed slightly from that
published in five aspects; a) scores were computed for genes as up- and downregulated, b) the
logFC computed, based on the mean of expression ratios, was replaced by the logFC_m based
on the median value of expression ratios, which increased score robustness, c) logFC_m values
were normalized to the interval [0,1] for upregulated and [-1,0] for downregulated genes to
avoid expression ratio bias among studies, d) the use of MAD (median absolute deviation)
rather than standard error values to compute the penalty term due to expression deviation
among replicates, which resulted in lower values for the penalty term and thus in more strin-
gent scores, and e) stringency was reinforced by a third condition imposed for calculation of
scores (B factor >0). Computation of the gene final score by the addition of each gene study
score might favor genes represented in a higher number of platforms. The last filter step
selected 10% of the genes on the complete list, which yielded the MPNST vs. NF signature; this
is nonetheless a more balanced representation of the gene list for each of the starting studies,
as it contains a larger proportion of genes common to various studies.

In addition to problems frequently encountered when comparing transcriptomes, integra-

tion of human and mouse data has drawbacks inherent to species-specific differences. As
mouse models do not appear to mimic human neurodegenerative diseases at molecular level
in every respect [27], we prioritized the human over the mouse transcriptome. Although
doubts remained regarding the incorporation of mouse data in the meta-analysis, we included
those data since robust genes expressed similarly in humans and mice could be candidates for
preclinical studies. As the gene signature includes the behavior of each gene regarding the spe-
cies and tissue type, it provides comprehensive information for the design of experiments.

The integrative gene signature associated to neurofibroma malignant evolution is the main
contribution of this work. This signature constitutes the first step to generate working hypoth-
eses concerning biomarkers of disease evolution and treatment effectiveness, as well as thera-
peutic drugs. Our in silico methodology used to define the signature and derive hypotheses for
experimental purposes could be applied in the study of orphan diseases other than NF1.

Conclusions

Here we used a meta-analysis method based on gene scores to define the gene signature associ-
ated to the transition of benign neurofibromas to MPNST. Signature components showing the
highest/lowest scores are proposed as disease biomarkers. Given the greater diagnostic and
prognostic robustness of biomarker panels compared to individual genes, we clustered

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

functionally related genes from profiles that integrate additional NF1-related gene signatures,
and established four panels derived from clusters 3, 17, 34 and cluster 25, which comprises
genes involved in cell cycle progression. By further studying the epigenetic regulation of malig-
nant transformation, we identified potential hypermethylated, silenced biomarkers, which
links promoter methylation status to gene expression profiles.

The gene signature was used to search for drugs able to reverse malignant phenotype.

Retrieved from NFFinder and previously tested for effectiveness, cantharidin, tamoxifen, TSA
and other HDAC inhibitors have yielded promising effects as candidates for chemotherapy.
We suggest HMGA2 and GSN genes, two targets of HDAC inhibitors, as epigenetic biomarkers
for testing the therapeutic effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors.

Materials and methods

The detailed workflow of selection and pre-processing of microarrays used to obtain the
MPNST vs. NF gene signature, translation to ENSEMBL gene names, and computation of
gene scores and of effect size medians, and final filters are shown in S4 Fig. Where appropriate,
tables are indicated for some of the main results generated (right). The meta-analysis PRISMA
checklist is included as supporting information (S2 Appendix).

Study selection

Microarray and DNA methylation studies were selected from GEO and ArrayExpress public
databases using the key words NF1, MPNST, neurofibromatosis, and neurofibroma; we
included high-throughput sequencing, microarray and methylation data. Additional selection
criteria were 1) for microarray studies, only data from Affymetrix, Agilent, ABI and Illumina
platforms were allowed, and 2) we only considered studies accepted for publication, with raw
data from samples from cell cultures or nerve tumors.

Microarray data preprocessing

Each microarray was preprocessed and evaluated independently using the R/BioConductor
software environment [63]. R packages used in pre-processing steps are detailed in Materials
and methods A in S1 Appendix. After grouping dNF and pNF samples as NF, and sporadic
and NF1-associated as MPNST, the resulting expression set was filtered to discard features
with FDR values >0.05 obtained by ANOVA. The expression set derived was used to assess
appropriate grouping of samples from the independent studies by principal component analy-
sis (PCA), as shown in S5 and S6 Figs. The final derived expression set was used to analyze
gene differential expression.

Probe name translation to human ENSEMBL and HUGO gene IDs and
mapping in human chromosome arms

As integration of scores from different platforms required common identifiers, we translated
probe names from each study to ENSEMBL human gene IDs according to Ensembl Archive
release 82 (September 2015). To obtain a unique score for each gene, we selected the score of
the probe with the greatest variation when the identifier was present more than once. This var-
iation was calculated as the variance of normalized expression values of all samples from the
two phenotypes compared. Mouse gene IDs were also translated to human homologous gene
IDs. Human ENSEMBL gene IDs were associated with HUGO gene nomenclature IDs and
mapped to human chromosomes and bands. Details of ENSEMBL gene ID association to
human chromosome arms are shown in Materials and methods B in S1 Appendix.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

Gene scores across studies and final individual gene score in a two-
phenotype comparison

Gene scores were also computed in the R/Bioconductor environment [63]; Materials and
methods C in S1 Appendix details the formula and computation method used. In an example
illustrating the factors involved in gene score computation, S13 Table shows values for the dif-
ferentially expressed genes obtained by comparing MPNST vs. NF from the GSE66743 study.
The final score across studies of a single species was calculated as the sum of standardized indi-
vidual sij scores. Final human and mouse scores were weighted for human results. Genes exclu-
sive to mouse were ignored and mouse data that differed from human data in the expression
ratio sign were discarded. The human score was calculated by adding scores from human stud-
ies. Inclusion of murine data was limited to genes for which the sign for the final human and
mouse scores were identical, and final human scores were not null.

logFC and logFC_m of genes across studies

Gene logFC were calculated across the studies as the median value of logFCij; logFCij values for
each gene (i) in each individual study (j) were obtained in the phenotype comparison. Gene
logFC_m were computed as the median value of logFC_mij; we have defined logFC_mij as the
log2 of the median value of all expression ratios between phenotypes. To avoid inconsistency,
the same restriction imposed on the final score was used for logFC and logFC_m values. The
signs for human median values of computed logFC/logFC_m were compared with those of
mouse. If human and mouse signs were equal, the mouse logFC/ logFC_m was used to com-
pute the final logFC/logFC_m. If the signs were different, mouse values were ignored and
human values were used as the final logFC/logFC_m.

Final filters to obtain the gene signature

To avoid inconsistency, the resulting list of genes with non-null score was screened to remove
genes showing score signs opposite to those of logFC values (S4 Fig, third filter). To select
genes with the highest score and median size effect values, a final filter was applied to the previ-
ous gene list (S4 Fig, fourth filter). This filter screened 10% of genes with the highest scores
(genes with positive score) and 10% of genes with the lowest score (genes with negative score).
In both cases, the absolute logFC value should be >0.99.

Computation of bias in score values among studies: Bhattacharyya
distance (BD) ratio

To determine the relative influence of individual experiments on final score values, we com-
puted for each gene the BD between the observed distribution of score frequency and the
expected discrete distribution if each study contributed equally to the final score. The lowest
BD values thus correlated with similar contributions of individual studies to final score val-
ues, while the highest values indicated disparity in the contribution of individual studies. To
compare BD without considering the number of studies available for each gene, we com-
puted the BD ratio by dividing the BD by the maximum possible BD value considering the
number of studies for each gene. The lowest and highest BD ratio values indicated the similar
or dissimilar contribution of each study to each gene score, respectively. A BD ratio equal to
zero was applied exceptionally to those genes for which only one study was available, to dis-
tinguish these genes from those for which there was more than one study, although only one
showed a non-null score. Computation details are given in Materials and methods D in S1
Appendix.

MPNST vs. NF gene signature

Statistical analyses

To determine the statistical significance of the different gene distribution frequencies in human
chromosome regions, we calculated the accumulated probability of a binomial distribution
P(Xx) using the pbinom function from the R stats package;  P 0.0001,  0.0001<P
0.001,  0.001 <P0.01,  0.01<P0.01. The expected frequency of gene distribution in
human chromosome arms/bands was calculated considering the association of ENSEMBL gene
IDs to human chromosome arms/bands. To assess correlation between values of two vectors,
Pearson’s product-moment correlation was calculated using the cor.test function from the R
stats package.

Gene and pathway functional enrichment

The over-representation test for GO terms from GO Ontology database release 2016_09_24
(The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015) was performed through PANTHER v.10 (release
20160715; [64]) using ENSEMBL IDs as input, Homo sapiens (all genes in the database) as ref-
erence list, GO biological process, GO molecular function and GO cellular component com-
plete as Annotation Data Set, and the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (P <0.05).
The EnrichNet tool [65] was used to inspect KEGG, BioCarta, Wiki Pathways and Reactome
databases to search for pathways in which a differentially expressed group of genes is enriched
compared to the whole human genome; ENSEMBL IDs were used as input. Only pathways
with a significant XD-score or Fischer q-value <0.1 were considered. The search for opposite
and similar gene signatures in CMap-DrugMatrix and GEO databases in NFFinder was per-
formed as described [20].

Gene clustering and visualization

Genes were grouped using SOTA [66] implemented in the analysis and visualization tool Mul-
tiexperimentViewer MeV v. 4.9 [67]. Parameters were fit by default, including distance (Pear-
son correlation), and Max. Cycles (100). Sample tree was carried out using hierarchical
clustering to optimize sample leaf order. Pearson correlation was selected as the distance met-
ric, and average linkage clustering as the linkage method.

DNA methylation analysis

Methylation data were downloaded from GEO, and inspected and analyzed using the MEDIPS
R package [68]. Linux command lines, R code based on Lienhard et al. [68], and details of the
analysis are shown in Materials and methods E in S1 Appendix.
