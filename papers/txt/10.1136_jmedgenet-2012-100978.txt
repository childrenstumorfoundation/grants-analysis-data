ABSTRACT
Although neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common
Mendelian disorder with autosomal-dominant inheritance,
its expression is highly variable and unpredictable. Many
NF1 patients have been genotyped but few allele-
phenotype correlations have been identiﬁed. NF1
genotype-phenotype correlations are difﬁcult to identify
because of the complexity of the NF1 phenotype, its
strong age dependency, the relatedness of many clinical
features and the huge heterogeneity of pathogenic NF1
mutations. Some NF1 patients with a given NF1
mutation may develop very severe disease while others
with the same mutation have only mild symptoms. This
phenotypic variability may be due to both modiﬁer genes
and environmental factors. Recent targeted strategies
have identiﬁed several interesting candidate modiﬁer
genes.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM 162200) is
an autosomal disorder with a worldwide birth inci-
dence of 1 in 2500 and a prevalence of at least 1 in
4000.1 NF1 is caused by dominant loss-of-function
mutations of the tumour-suppressor gene NF1
(Neuroﬁbromin 1; OMIM 613113) which encodes
neuroﬁbromin, a negative regulator of RAS pro-
teins. The main clinical features of NF1 are mul-
tiple café-au-lait (CAL) spots, axillary freckling,
Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas and periph-
eral nerve-sheath tumours.1–3 NF1 patients are at
an increased risk of developing both benign and
malignant tumours, and NF1 is thus classiﬁed as a
tumour predisposition syndrome. Although NF1 is
a simply determined Mendelian disorder with com-
plete penetrance, it is characterised by highly vari-
able expression and marked inter- and intrafamilial
variation.2 Some NF1 patients with a given muta-
tion may develop very severe disease while others
with the same mutation develop a mild form. The
reasons for this clinical variability are poorly under-
stood. Evidence for the existence of modiﬁer genes
has been obtained in large familial studies.2 3
Recent targeted strategies have identiﬁed several
candidate modiﬁer genes, and it is hoped that the
genomics revolution will
rapid
progress.

PHENOTYPIC VARIABILITY IN NF1
NF1 is a highly variable disease. It rapidly emerged
that the nature of the NF1 gene mutation was not
the only source of this variation, as considerable
differences in clinical expression were noted within
the same family. Indeed, Carey et al found that
three-quarters of families showed marked inter-
in NF1 severity.1 The
individual differences

remainder of the phenotypic variability could be
due to modiﬁer genes, environmental factors or a
combination of the two. The term ‘modiﬁer gene’
is used here to denote any gene that inﬂuences one
or several features of the NF1 phenotype. The
word ‘gene’ is taken in its broad deﬁnition, includ-
ing protein-coding sequences and microRNA and
long non coding RNA genes that may modulate
the NF1 phenotype. In principle, variations in the
NF1 phenotype could be determined by a single
modiﬁer gene locus, or by interaction between
several modiﬁer genes. However, environmental
factors might also contribute to the variable
disease expression. Studies of NF1 clinical hetero-
geneity are hindered by the fact that the clinical
course of a given patient may vary dramatically
over his or her lifetime.

It is important to take other determinants into
account when searching for modiﬁer genes. For
example,
the average serum concentration of
25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD), which plays a key
role in bone metabolism and modulates the absorp-
tion of dietary calcium and phosphorus, is lower in
NF1 patients than in individuals without NF1,4
and the incidence of fractures has been found to be
higher than in siblings and spouses without NF1.5
Low 25OHD concentrations have been associated
with tumours and osteopenia or fractures in adults
with NF1. The serum 25OHD concentration has
been found to correlate negatively with the number
of dermal neuroﬁbromas in NF1 patients.6 Another
study showed low 25OHD concentrations in the
majority of children with NF1, potentially because
of increased pigmentation and/or decreased sun-
light exposure.5 However, low 25OHD concentra-
tions
associated with
neuroﬁbromas, and 25OHD levels did not correlate
with bone mineral density.

in children were not

identiﬁed in patients

Age is the most important confounding factor
in familial NF1 studies, many disease features
being more prevalent in older patients.7 Somatic
mosaicism in de novo NF1 cases must also be con-
sidered, because it may lead to milder or atypical
NF1 phenotypes.8 9 In 2007, germline dominant
loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene
were
fulﬁlling the US
National Institutes of Health criteria for NF1,
underlining a genetic heterogeneity for NF1
phenotype.10
(caused by
SPRED1 mutations) resembles a mild NF1 pheno-
type, with multiple CAL spots and macrocephaly,
with or without axillary or inguinal freckling. By
contrast, other typical
features of NF1 (Lisch
nodules, bone abnormalities, neuroﬁbromas, optic
pathway gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumours (MPNST)) are lacking.

Genotype-phenotype correlations

If the phenotypic variability of NF1 is determined primarily
by modiﬁer genes, then the phenotypic intrafamilial correlation
will decrease with the degree of relatedness. However, stronger
correlations between close relatives than between distant rela-
tives could also result from shared environmental inﬂuences.
This pitfall can be avoided by comparing phenotypic correla-
tions in monozygotic (MZ) twins and other siblings.

FIRST CLUES: NATURAL HISTORY STUDIES
Twin studies are a valuable tool for studying genetic disorders,
particularly to estimate the heritability of clinical phenotypes.
Heritability is deﬁned as the proportion of phenotypic variance
due to genetic variance.12 13 Twins are usually considered to
share the same environment, independently of their zygosity. If
MZ twins have a more similar clinical phenotype than dizyg-
otic twins, this is likely to be explained by the effect of genetic
modiﬁers on the clinical phenotype. There are at least 30 pub-
lished case reports of MZ twins with NF1. Many MZ twins
have very similar clinical features (CAL spots, axillary and
inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, epilepsy, non-dysplastic scoli-
osis, renal vascular hypertension, unilateral ptosis and cutane-
ous neuroﬁbromas).2 3 14 In principle, this is explained by
identical NF1 mutations, near-identical genomic backgrounds
and very similar pre- and perinatal environments. Few MZ
twins with markedly different NF1 features have been
described,15 but the causative mutations were not always iden-
tiﬁed. In a recent study of a pair of MZ twins, only one of
whom had a NF1 phenotype, a postzygotic NF1 gene mutation
(leading to somatic mosaicism for the NF1 mutation) was
exclusively identiﬁed in the affected twin.16 Plexiform neuro-
ﬁbromas tend to be less concordant than other features in
twins with NF1. As the onset of many NF1-related tumours
requires a second mutation in the wild-type NF1 allele, the
sporadic nature of such mutations has been forwarded to
explain this discrepancy. Other non hereditary factors could
also inﬂuence tumour initiation and growth, such as epigenetic
changes, somatic mutations in other tumour-related genes and
environmental factors. A recent report describes a pair of MZ
twins with NF1 resulting from a de novo mutation, both of
whom developed a left-sided sciatic plexiform neuroﬁbroma
that progressed to MPNST at a similar age, with pulmonary
metastasis also occurring at the same age.14 However, data
on MZ twins, although precious, should be interpreted with
care. First, the sample size is always small, with only 10 pairs
in the largest series. Second, certain complications of NF1 that
require imaging studies (eg, whole-body MRI for internal plexi-
form neuroﬁbromas) are not always documented. Finally, many
twins are studied at a young age, and their subsequent course
is not known.

Clues to the existence of modiﬁer genes in NF1 have also
been provided by studies of associations between NF1 clinical
features. Szudek et al found signiﬁcant associations between
Lisch nodules, optic glioma, learning disability, macrocephaly
and short stature in affected parent-child pairs, but they did
not adjust for the non-independence of multiple pairs of rela-
tives from the same family or for associations between clinical
features in patients.17 A later analysis examined correlations
between NF1 features among relatives of various degrees and
conﬁrmed that genetic factors determined the onset of particu-
lar phenotypic features in NF1.18

GENETIC COMPONENT OF VARIABLE EXPRESSION IN NF1
Several studies of the contribution of genetic factors to the
phenotypic variation of NF1 have examined NF1-related traits

in large series of multiple-case NF1 families. The patterns of
variable expression are subtle, hence data on a very large
number of patients and/or very large families are required.

Only three studies have assessed the inherited component of
variable expression in large cohorts of well-phenotyped NF1
families.2 3 18 In 1993, Easton et al studied 175 NF1 patients
belonging to 48 families, including six pairs of MZ twins, 76
pairs of sibs, 60 parent-offspring pairs, 54 pairs of second-degree
relatives and 43 pairs of third-degree relatives.2 Eight clinical
features of NF1 were scored, comprising three quantitative
traits (number of CAL spots, cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, and
head circumference) and ﬁve binary traits (presence or absence
of plexiform neuroﬁbromas, optic gliomas, scoliosis, epilepsy
and referral for remedial education). Signiﬁcant intrafamilial
correlations were found for the three quantitative traits. The
correlation was strongest in MZ twins, followed by ﬁrst-degree
relatives and then by distant relatives. The strong correlation in
MZ twins suggested a major genetic component in the variable
expression, while the weak correlation between distant relatives
suggested that the type of mutation at the NF1 locus itself
played only a minor role. Easton et al concluded that the
phenotypic expression of NF1 was largely determined by the
genotype at modiﬁer loci and that these modiﬁer genes were
trait-speciﬁc.

About 10 years after the study by Easton et al, a second large
familial phenotype correlation study was published.18 Szudek
et al examined familial aggregation of NF1 features among 904
affected individuals belonging to 373 families with two or
more affected members (346 families were nuclear families that
included either an affected parent and one or more affected
children, or two or more affected sibs). The study population
was ﬁve times larger than that of Easton et al, and 10 clinical
features were examined (CAL spots,
intertrigous freckling,
Lisch nodules, cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, subcutaneous neuro-
ﬁbromas, plexiform neuroﬁbromas, seizures, scoliosis, optic
glioma and other neoplasms). All the phenotypic traits were
treated as binary variables, and multivariate regression was
used to measure associations between various classes of rela-
tives for each feature. As Easton et al had previously noted, the
familial patterns suggested that most of the studied clinical fea-
tures had important genetic components but that their relative
contribution differed according to the feature in question.

These two studies thus demonstrated a strong genetic com-
ponent in NF1 variability but both suffered from certain limita-
tions. Easton et al examined a limited number of patients,
while Szudek et al, although studying a larger number of
patients, could not investigate many distant relatives, owing to
the small number of extended families. Moreover, this latter
study did not consider CAL spots and dermal neuroﬁbromas
(major manifestations of NF1) as quantitative variables but as
binary traits. In a third large familial phenotype study, Sabbagh
et al used variance components analysis, based on maximum
likelihood procedures, to estimate the proportion of phenotypic
variation attributable to genetic effects.3 Patterns of familial
correlations were examined for 12 clinical features, including
ﬁve quantitative traits (numbers of small and large CAL spots
and cutaneous, subcutaneous and plexiform neuroﬁbromas)
and seven binary traits. These traits were scored in 750 NF1
patients from 275 multiplex families. With the exception of
malignant neoplasms, all these features showed signiﬁcant
familial aggregation after adjustment for age and sex, that is, a
particular feature was more likely to be present in close rela-
tives than in the NF1 general population. The patterns of
familial correlation indicated a strong genetic component for

most features, with no apparent inﬂuence of the constitutional
NF1 mutation. In accordance with the ﬁndings of Szudek and
Easton, several statistically signiﬁcant associations between
combinations of clinical features were also found, suggesting
that some NF1 features may share common genetic determi-
nants. These results indicated a possible common repertoire of
genetic modiﬁers for some trait combinations.

By analysing phenotype correlations in well-phenotyped NF1
families, these three large studies provided further evidence
that genetic modiﬁers contribute to the variable expression of
NF1.2 3 18 This has since been conﬁrmed by studies of NF1
mouse models.

NF1 MOUSE MODELS: CONFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE
OF MODIFIER GENES
Mice heterozygous for an Nf1 ‘knockout’ mutation (Nf1+/−)
are viable, fertile and cancer-prone, like their human counter-
parts.19 However, these animals do not develop some hallmark
features of the human disease,
including neuroﬁbromas and
MPNSTs. The lack of neuroﬁbromas in Nf1+/− mice was attrib-
uted to the very low frequency of inactivation of the remaining
functional Nf1 allele in Schwann cells. The frequency of a
second-hit mutation was therefore proposed to be the rate-
limiting event in the onset of neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs in
mice. Mismatch-repair genes (MMR) have been proposed as
putative modiﬁer genes inﬂuencing the NF1-associated tumour
frequency in humans. In addition, a low frequency of neuro-
ﬁbromas is observed in zebraﬁsh with knockout mutations of
three major MMR genes (mlh1, msh2, and msh6).20

MOUSE GENETIC BACKGROUND AND NF1-ASSOCIATED
TUMOUR SUSCEPTIBILITY
The frequent coexistence of NF1 and TP53 mutations in
human MPNSTs suggested that these mutations could cooper-
ate to promote MPNSTs. Nf1 and Trp53 are close together on
the mouse chromosome 11. Mating of Nf1+/− and Trp53+/−
mice resulted in Nf1+/−;Trp53+/−trans mice that exhibited
increased susceptibility to MPNSTs.21 This susceptibility was
further increased in Nf1+/−;Trp53+/−cis mice carrying the two
mutant alleles on the same chromatid.21 Moreover, Nf1+/−;
Trp53+/−cis mice spontaneously develop cancers associated with
the human NF1 syndrome, including astrocytomas.22 23 This
was consistent with the observation that the Nf1 and Trp53
wild-type alleles could both be lost in a single genetic event in
Nf1+/−;Trp53+/−cis mice. These results conﬁrmed that homozy-
gous mutations in the NF1 and TP53 tumour-suppressor genes
cooperate in the development of MPNSTs. Moreover, tumour
susceptibility appeared to be dependent on the genetic back-
ground of mice carrying the Nf1 and Trp53 cis mutations.22 23 It
was therefore postulated that tumour susceptibility might be
inﬂuenced by Nf1 expression levels. Hawes et al examined levels
of Nf1 gene expression in mouse strains with different degrees
of tumour susceptibility.24 They found that the strain back-
ground had as much an effect on Nf1 expression levels as did
mutation of one Nf1 allele, indicating that animal studies of
haploinsufﬁciency must be interpreted carefully with respect to
the strain background. Because Nf1 expression levels did not
correlate perfectly with strain susceptibility to tumours, it was
suggested either that variations in Nf1 expression levels were
not responsible for the differences in astrocytoma susceptibility
in Nf1−/+;Trp53−/+cis mice, or that certain mouse strains had
evolved mechanisms to compensate for differences in Nf1
expression. Interestingly, one of the strongest determinants
of astrocytoma and MPNST tumour
susceptibility was

Genotype-phenotype correlations

inheritance of the Nf1;Trp53 mutant chromosome from the
mother or father.23 25 It has been postulated that an imprinted
gene on chromosome 11 may be responsible for these differ-
ences in susceptibility. However, no modiﬁer gene responsible
for variations in tumour susceptibility in Nf1:Trp53 cis mice
were identiﬁed in a recent study using real-time PCR to test
many of the imprinted candidate genes on mouse chromosome
11.26 However, mapping of modiﬁers in Nf1+/−;Trp53+/−cis
mice has led to the identiﬁcation of several loci, unlinked to
chromosome 11, that are responsible for susceptibility to
MPNST and astrocytomas in backcross populations.25 Two
nerve sheath tumour resistance (Nstr) loci were identiﬁed: one near
the centromere of chromosome 19 (Nstr1), and one at the prox-
imal end of chromosome 15 (Nstr2).25 Nstr1 is syntenic with
human chromosome 11q13–12, a region involved in transloca-
tions found in human MPNSTs. Nstr2 is syntenic with human
chromosome regions 5p13–15 and 8q22–24. Human chromo-
some region 8q22–23 is often ampliﬁed in MPNSTs and is also
subject to translocation. Nstr1 and Nstr2 may act epistatically,
with inheritance of the mutant chromosome 11 from the
mother or father. Further work is required to conﬁrm this
strain-background effect, and the mechanisms underlying the
effect of modiﬁer genes on the tumour spectrum.

Mouse models do not currently mimic the full human NF1
phenotype. For example, mice lacking the alternatively spliced
Nf1 exon 23a show speciﬁc learning impairments.27 In humans,
exon 23a is predominantly included in most tissues and specif-
ically skipped in central nervous system neurons. It is possible
that alteration of alternative splicing could have a role as a
genetic modiﬁer of the learning disabilities in NF1 patients. A
human-centered genetic approach will be necessary to identify
NF1 modiﬁer genes.

GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS IN NF1
Phenotypic studies of large cohorts suggest that the type of
mutation in the NF1 gene does not account for the obser-
ved phenotype variability,2 3 18 and this was conﬁrmed by
genotype-phenotype correlation studies.

In addition to modiﬁer genes, allelic heterogeneity of constitu-
tional NF1 mutations could also contribute to disease variability.
Almost half of all NF1 cases result from sporadic mutations, and
a huge number of NF1 pathogenic mutations have been
reported, hindering genotype-phenotype correlation studies.
Between 5% and 10% of pathogenic mutations are large 17q11
deletions encompassing the entire NF1 locus and neighbouring
genes. Since their initial description in 1992, NF1 deletions have
been linked to a more severe clinical phenotype than intragenic
NF1 mutations. This ‘contiguous gene syndrome’ appears to
include dysmorphic features, learning disabilities, cardiovascular
malformations, childhood overgrowth, a higher burden of cuta-
neous neuroﬁbromas, earlier onset of benign neuroﬁbromas and,
probably, a higher incidence of MPNSTs.28–30 Some authors have
speculated that increased malignancy may be explained by varia-
tions in the expression of tumour suppressor genes located in
co-deleted regions.31 32

In patients with intragenic NF1 mutations (>90% of cases),
no clear-cut allele-phenotype correlations have so far been
established, with the exception of a 3-bp inframe deletion
(c.2970–2972 delAAT) in exon 17, which has been linked to a
particular clinical phenotype characterised by the absence of
cutaneous neuroﬁbromas.33 Other studies have attempted to
identify genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with
atypical NF1 phenotypes and/or mutation types. Patients with
multiple spinal tumours but few or no other clinical features of

forming a subgroup or distinct
genetic form of NF1 called spinal neuroﬁbromatosis.34–36
Several studies have shown that patients with spinal tumours
can have various NF1 symptoms and NF1 mutations. A recent
publication reported a trend towards clustering of pathogenic
tertile of the NF1 gene in patients with optic
changes in the 5
pathway gliomas.37

INVOLVEMENT OF UNLINKED MODIFIER GENES IN
PHENOTYPIC VARIABILITY
The role of the normal (wild-type) NF1 allele (in trans to the
primary mutation) in the variable expression of NF1 was
recently investigated in a family-based association study.3 Nine
tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NF1 were geno-
typed in 1132 individuals from 313 NF1 families. No signiﬁcant
deviations of transmission of any of the NF1 variants to
affected offspring was found for any of the 12 clinical features
examined, based on single marker or haplotype analysis. This
study provided evidence for a strong genetic component in
most NF1 clinical features but no apparent inﬂuence of the
NF1 gene: neither the constitutional NF1 mutation nor the
normal NF1 allele seemed to contribute signiﬁcantly to
the overall phenotypic variation of each trait. However, altera-
tions in expression levels of the wild-type NF1 allele were not
excluded by this study. Recent reports concerning the func-
tional structure of the human genome show that differences in
transcription may also explain disease variability, and that the
transcription domain of a given gene might extend very far
beyond the usual regulatory sequences. This is in keeping with
the different levels of Nf1 expression observed in mouse strain
backgrounds with speciﬁc phenotypes.22 No determinants of
NF1 transcript levels, which could be regarded as NF1 modiﬁer
genes, have yet been found.

BIOLOGY-DRIVEN CANDIDATE GENE STRATEGY TO
IDENTIFY MODIFIER GENES
Strategies used to show the role of genetic factors in pheno-
typic expression can be classiﬁed into two categories: (i) a sys-
tematic approach in which the whole genome is scanned, and
(ii) an approach focusing on candidate genes or pathways.38
The candidate-gene approach can be deﬁned as the study of
genetic determinants of a complex trait based on: (i) generating
hypotheses and identifying candidate genes that might have a
pathogenic role; (ii) identifying variants (SNPs) in or near these
genes; and (iii) genotyping of variants in a population, followed
by statistical methods (linkage or association) to identify corre-
lations with the phenotype.39 Testing of variants in carefully
selected candidates is attractive for several reasons: the number
of variants is generally small, thereby avoiding severe penalties
for multiple comparisons during the statistical analysis. A
detailed understanding of the candidate gene product and its
variants provides mechanistic insight and facilitates experimen-
tal studies to evaluate the modiﬁer effects.

Several approaches can be used to select candidate genes. A
deeper understanding of the biochemical functions of neuroﬁ-
bromin may lead to the discovery of interacting proteins and of
upstream and downstream effectors that are critical for the
development of particular phenotypic features. In both humans
and mice, NF1 tumour development results from a combin-
ation of ubiquitous NF1 heterozygosity and unpredictable NF1
lineages.40

Neuroﬁbroma-derived Schwann cells harbouring two mutated

mas. Mitotic recombination is the likely mechanism underlying

this loss of heterozygosity.41 As mitotic recombination shows
inter-individual variation, genes that control this phenomenon
may partly explain the variable number of neuroﬁbromas in
NF1 patients, by inﬂuencing the somatic mutation rate.

The variable number of NF1-associated neuroﬁbromas could
also be due to variable accumulation of somatic NF1 mutations.
Two research groups have described the role of MMR genes in
neuroﬁbroma development in NF1.42 43 Both provided evidence
that a reduction in MMR capacity can result in NF1 mutations
in a high percentage of neuroﬁbromas. It has been postulated
that constitutional or early alterations of MMR genes in NF1
patients may lead to an accumulation of second hits in NF1, a
human gene with one of the highest mutation rates. However,
apart from one report, no constitutional mutations in MMR
genes have been detected in NF1 patients.44 A recent study
examined whether
load in NF1 (higher
number of cutaneous neuroﬁbromas) was associated with
methylation of MMR genes.45 Titze
al performed
methylation-speciﬁc PCR and pyrosequencing of MMR gene
promoters most frequently involved in human cancers (MLH1,
MSH6, PMS2, and MSH2) in leukocytes of NF1 patients. They
found that in NF1 patients with a high number of cutaneous
neuroﬁbromas versus those with a low, methylation of two (out
of six) CpG dinucleotides in MSH2 promoter was enhanced.

et

Biology-driven modiﬁer genes have also been suggested to
play a role in dermal neuroﬁbromas. Dermal neuroﬁbromas
occur in virtually all
individuals with NF1. Recent elegant
studies have pointed to skin-derived neural progenitors (SKPs),
or their derivatives, as the cell of origin of NF1-associated
dermal neuroﬁbromas.46 When Nf1-homozygous SKPs were
autologously implanted intradermally in mice, they only gave
rise to dermal neuroﬁbromas in female mice that were pregnant
at the time of implantation, and not in males or non pregnant
females. This suggested that the hormonal environment may
be a critical factor in the onset of dermal neuroﬁbromas. NF1
patients typically begin to develop dermal neuroﬁbromas
around puberty, and the number and size of neuroﬁbromas
increases during pregnancy.47 48 McLaughlin et al reported that
5% of human neuroﬁbromas express the oestrogen receptor
(ER), while 75% express the progesterone receptor.49 Studies
have conﬁrmed steroid hormone receptor expression and ligand-
mediated cell growth and survival
in both normal human
Schwann cells and neuroﬁbroma-derived Schwann cell cul-
tures.50 Moreover, an increased potential for malignant trans-
formation of plexiform neuroﬁbromas has been reported during
pregnancy.51 The selective ER modulator tamoxifen has been
tested for
its ability to inhibit MPNST tumourigenesis.
Tamoxifen showed potent antitumor activity in mice orthoto-
pically xenografted with human MPNST cells, providing a
rationale for clinical trials.52 Thus, steroid hormones may dir-
ectly inﬂuence neuroﬁbroma initiation or progression by acting
through their cognate receptors, but these effects may only
apply to a subset of tumours.50

Because of their co-localisation with neuroﬁbromin, mito-
chondria are also attractive NF1 modiﬁer candidates.
In
Drosophila, neuroﬁbromin regulates longevity and stress resist-
ance through cAMP regulation of mitochondrial respiration and
ROS production.53 Recently,
the role of mitochondria in
tumour development has gained much attention, with reports
of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in several
human cancers.54 Somatic mtDNA mutations have also been
described in NF1-associated neuroﬁbromas.55 Moreover, varia-
tions in mtDNA copy numbers are increasingly reported in a
range of primary human cancers, suggesting that they may be

IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE MODIFIER GENES
IN NF1: PROOF OF CONCEPT

In a
recent
high-resolution
hybridisation
of NF1-associated plexiform neuroﬁbromas to identify candi-
date modiﬁer genes.58 For the ﬁrst time, 9p21.3 deletions were
identiﬁed as the only recurrent somatic alterations in these
tumours. The smallest common deleted region in 9p21.3
included the CDKN2A-CDKN2B-ARF gene cluster and the
ANRIL gene, a large non coding RNA. This recurrent 9p21.3
deletion was also found in a series of atypical neuroﬁbromas
(symptomatic hypercellular benign peripheral nerve sheath
tumours) but not in dermal or plexiform tumours, in an inde-
pendent study.59 A family-based association study60 was then
carried out using tag SNPs located in region 9p21.3 in 1105 sub-
jects from 306 families. Allele T of SNP rs2151280 (located in
ANRIL) was strongly associated with a larger number of plexi-
form neuroﬁbromas.58 No such association was observed with
dermal neuroﬁbromas. However, the ANRIL SNP rs2151280 has
not been tested for its possible functional effects on neuro-
ﬁbroma formation. To conﬁrm the role of rs2151280, CDKN2A,
CDKN2B, ARF and ANRIL expression was analysed in 124 NF1
patients’ peripheral blood cells. Allele T of rs2151280 was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with reduced ANRIL transcript levels.58
This study demonstrated the relevance of whole-genome char-
acterisation for the identiﬁcation of candidate modiﬁer genes in
plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Targeted strategies hold great promise
for the identiﬁcation of novel genetic variants responsible for
the heritable features and complications of NF1. However, this
candidate-gene approach has been criticised for its poor repro-
ducibility and its inability to include all possible causative
genes and polymorphisms.38 New genome-wide techniques
may overcome these limitations.

FROM GENETICS TO GENOMICS: PROMISE OF
GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES AND
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING IN NF1
Low-cost genotyping arrays allow researchers
to perform
unbiased genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS can
scan millions of common SNPs for their association with
human complex traits.61 62 The repertoire of common human
DNA sequence variants now provides good coverage of all
common variations of the human genome.63 One strategy is to
study a small number of subjects with high-density genome-
wide technologies, followed by additional subjects and/or add-
itional SNPs at regions of interest thus identiﬁed. With the
advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods and data
from the 1000 Genomes Project,64 investigators must choose
among (or combine) multiple strategies for creating and testing
sites.65 Genome-wide
a
methods hold great promise for identifying modiﬁer genes
in NF1.

Genotype-phenotype correlations

CONCLUSION
Cohort studies have shown that the clinical expression of NF1
tends to be similar in close relatives, but this similarity falls
well short of that required for prognostication. The relatively
minor contribution of variations at the NF1 locus to disease
expression suggests that precise knowledge of NF1 mutations
will generally be unhelpful.

The ﬁrst and probably the most important step in the search
for modiﬁer genes is to select a particular clinical trait and the
most relevant study population. The NF1 manifestations should
be differentiated at different levels (features, consequences, and
complications) in order to precisely deﬁne the relation between
genetic modiﬁers and phenotypic characteristics.66

Modiﬁer genes often have at least two alleles, one of which
exacerbates the disease and one that suppresses it by raising the
threshold for trait expression. Mimicking and perhaps enhancing
the effects of naturally occurring genetic modiﬁers might lead to
new therapeutics. A better understanding of the basis for vari-
able disease presentation in general, and for disease suppression
in particular, could improve the prediction, treatment and
perhaps even the prevention of several NF1 complications.67
