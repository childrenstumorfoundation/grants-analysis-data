miRNAs have been recently implicated as drivers in several carcinogenic processes, 
where  they  can  act  either  as  oncogenes  or  as  tumor  suppressors.  Schwannomas 
arise from Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system. 
These  benign  tumors  typically  result  from  loss  of  the  neurofibromatosis  type  2 
(NF2) tumor suppressor gene. We have recently carried out high-throughput miRNA 
expression profiling of human vestibular schwannomas using an array representing 
407 known miRNAs in order to explore the role of miRNAs in the tumorigenesis of 
schwannomas. We found that miR-7 functions as a “tumor suppressor” by targeting 
proteins in three major oncogenic pathways - EGFR, Pak1, and Ack1. Interestingly, 
in this study, we also observed that several previously described potential tumor 
suppressor miRNAs that are down-regulated in malignant tumors were up-regulated 
in schwannomas. Here we discuss the possibility that “tumor suppressor” miRNAs 
may play a role in the transition stage(s) of cancer from benign to malignant forms.

mirNA biogeNesis

It has been almost two decades since the discovery of 
a new class of non-coding RNA molecules by Ambros and 
colleagues [1]. The term microRNA (miRNA) was coined 
to describe these short (~21-23 nucleotides long), single-
stranded RNA molecules which were later shown to be a 
key part of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of 
gene expression in diverse organisms [2,3]. Up to now, 
>15000  miRNAs  have  been  identified  in  >100  species 
(miRbase,  Release  16,  Sept  2010;  http://www.mirbase.
org/). Computational predictions suggest that mammalian 
miRNAs control the activity of up to one-third of known 
protein-coding  genes  [4].  miRNA  functions  are  evident 
from  birth  to  death,  encompassing  diverse  cellular 
processes,  such  as  cell  proliferation,  differentiation, 
development  and  cell  death  [5]. Alterations  in  miRNA 
biogenesis  and/or  levels  are  associated  with  several 
disease  states,  including  cancer,  autoimmune  disorders 
and neurodegenerative diseases.

Owing  to  the  extensive  research  on  miRNA 
biogenesis  in  the  past  decade,  we  now  understand  the 

precise  details  of  how  miRNAs  are  produced  within 
the  cell.  miRNA  biogenesis  is  spatially  organized  in 
two  compartments:  nuclear  and  cytoplasmic  (Fig.  1). 
Within  the  nucleus,  RNA  polymerase  II  or  III  dictates 
the  transcription  of  miRNA-coding  genes  to  produce 
“pri-microRNAs”.  These  pri-microRNA  molecules  are 
then cleaved by the action of a microprocessor complex 
consisting  of  Drosha,  a  RNase  III  class  enzyme,  and  a 
double stranded RNA-binding protein, DGCR8 (DiGeorge 
critical  region  8),  generating  so-called  pre-microRNAs 
(~70  nucleotide)  [6,7].  Alternatively,  transcription  of 
very short intronic sequences (referred to as mirtrons) by 
RNA polymerase II and further splicing & debranching 
processes  can  also  produce  pre-microRNAs,  thereby 
by-passing  the  initial  cleavage  by  the  microprocessor 
complex  [8].  In  either  case,  resulting  pre-microRNA 
molecules are transferred to cytoplasm through Exportin 
5 – Ran-GTP. Within the cytoplasm, another RNase III 
class enzyme, Dicer, interacts with other double stranded 
RNA-binding  proteins,  including  Argonaute  2  (Ago2), 
to form RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which 
binds  to  pre-microRNA  molecules  to  cleave  them

Figure 1: Simplified representative scheme of miRNA biogenesis. miRNA biogenesis starts in nucleus, 
where miRNA genes are transcribed by either RNA polymerase II or III, producing “pri-microRNAs”. Pri-
microRNAs are then cleaved by the action of a microprocessor complex, consisting of Drosha-DGCR8, and 
giving rise to pre-microRNAs. When the length and secondary structure of an intron (mirtron) resembles 
that of a microRNA, cellular splicing machinery can single-handedly take the place of Drosha processing 
to produce a pre-microRNA. Exportin-5 mediates the transport of these pre-microRNA molecules into the 
cytoplasm, where they interact with a number of different proteins to form RNA-induced silencing complex 
(RISC). Dicer cleaves pre-microRNAs into duplex miRNAs, whereas Argonoute proteins mediate strand 
selection to produce mature miRNA molecules. The nature of the complementarity between the miRNA 
and its target determine the ultimate fate of the transcript. If the complementarity is perfect, the target 
will be cleaved. On the other hand, in case of imperfect complementarity, the result will be repression of 
translation. Alternatively, miRNAs can also destabilize target RNAs through deadenylation

Following  strand  selection  and 
separation by Ago2, activated RISC binds to its mRNA 
target(s)  to  exert  its  effect  on  translation.  The  ultimate 
result of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression 
depends  on  the  extent  of  complementarity  between  the 
miRNA and its target sequence (Fig. 1). In case of perfect 
complementarity, miRNAs will mediate target cleavage. 
If  the  complementarity  is  imperfect,  the  result  will  be 
translational repression [9].

their 

roles 

Considering 

in  cell  proliferation 
and  death,  it  has  been  suggested  that  miRNAs  could 
contribute  to  oncogenesis.  Indeed,  miRNA  profiling 
studies revealed that dysregulation in miRNA levels are 
associated with various cancers [reviewed in 11,12]. The 
term “oncomir” has been coined to describe these cancer-
associated  miRNAs,  although  some  use  this  term  only 
to  describe  miRNAs  showing  oncogenic  characteristics. 
Recent  studies  have  also  shown  that  defects  in  miRNA 
processing are also related to cellular transformation and 
tumor formation [10]. Further support for miRNA-cancer 
association comes from genome-wide analysis of cancer-
associated microRNAs. It has been estimated that almost 
~50%  of  miRNA-coding  genes  are  present  in  fragile 
sites and/or cancer-associated regions within the genome 
[13,14]. 

the 

Characterization  of 

chromosome  13q14 
deletion in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
represented  the  first  indication  of  involvement  of  a 
miRNA  in  cancer,  showing  that  miR-15  and  miR-16, 
encoded in this chromosomal region, were either lost or 
downregulated in a majority of CLL patients [15]. Further 
research  on  miRNA-cancer  association  predominantly 
focused  on  elucidating  differential  miRNA  expression 
profiles in different cancers. As a result, we now know that 
hundreds of miRNA levels are dysregulated in malignant 
tumors of lung, breast, colon, liver and brain . 

Depending on the disease state, expression of specific 
microRNAs can either be increased or decreased. miRNAs 
with upregulated expression levels in cancer, often known 
as  “oncomirs”,  aid  tumor  formation.  Examples  of  such 
oncomirs  include:  miR-17-92,  associated  with  lung 
cancer  and  lymphoma  [16,17];  and  miR-372  and  miR 
373, associated with testicular germ cell tumors [18]. On 
the other hand, miRNAs with downregulated expression 
levels  are  regarded  as  “tumor  suppressors”.  These 
molecules  have  negative  effect  on  tumor  formation  and 
development. The let-7 family represents one of the best 
examples of a tumor suppressor miRNA [19]. 

There  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  before  deciphering 
miRNA involvement in cancers will be fully elucidated. 
Hundreds of candidate miRNAs remain to be characterized 
as  oncomirs  or  tumor  suppressors  for  different  types  of 

tumors. The precise details of miRNAs function in cancer 
pathogenesis,  as  well  as  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic 
potential of miRNAs are an active area of research. 

the  mirNA 
schwANNomAs 

regulAtioN 

of 

In a recent study, we defined the miRNA signature 
of  schwannomas  by  miRNA  microarray  expression 
profiling of human vestibular schwannomas as compared 
to control nerve sheaths [20]. This signature includes 12 
miRNAs that are deregulated in most schwannoma tumor 
samples. Out of these 12 miRNAs, 8 were confirmed to 
be significantly upregulated in schwannomas (5-20-fold); 
and  4  miRNAs  to  be  downregulated  (5-12-fold).  Based 
on  the  relative  fold  increase,  as  assessed  by  qRT-PCR 
assays,  the  most  upregulated  miRNAs  in  schwannomas 
were let-7d (about 22-fold), miR-451 (about 17-fold), and 
miR-23b (about 15-fold). The let-7 family has been the 
most studied of the potential “tumor suppressor” miRNAs 
and contains 11 family members (http://microrna.sanger.
ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/query.pl?terms=let-7; 
reviewed 
in 21). This family acts as tumor suppressors to control 
several oncogenic pathways, including the Ras pathway 
[22], as well as oncogenes, HMGA2 [23] and c-Myc [24]. 
Two recent studies support the possible tumor suppressor 
function of this miRNA family in mouse models of breast 
and lung cancer, with elevated levels of let-7 inhibiting 
growth of these tumors [25,26]. In our study, we found 
that one of the members of the let-7 family, let-7d, was 
upregulated  in  schwannomas.  Interestingly,  we  have 
recently  shown  in  another  NF2-related  benign  tumor, 
meningiomas,  that  let-7d,  let-7b,  and  let-7g  are  also 
upregulated  as  compared  to  the  arachnoidal  tissue  of 
origin  [27].  Interestingly,  the  second  most  upregulated 
miRNA  in  schwanommas,  miR-451  has  also  recently 
been shown to function as a potential tumor suppressor 
miRNA in human gastric and colon cancer cells, with its 
overexpression  decreasing  proliferation  and  increasing 
response to ionizing radiation in culture [28]. 

However, in some cases, there appears to be reverse 
regulation of miRNA levels in malignant versus benign 
tumors.  In  human  malignant  prostate  cancers,  miR-
23a  and  miR-23b  were  shown  to  be  downregulated 
compared  to  normal  prostate  tissues  [29].  In  contrast, 
in  our  study  miR-23b  was  found  to  be  upregulated 
in  benign  schwannomas.  Interestingly,  a  recent  study 
showed 
in 
increased expression of the protein encoded in one of its 
target mRNAs, mitochondrial glutaminase [30]. This, in 
turn,  appears  to  be  responsible  for  increased  glutamine 
catabolism  in  prostate  cancers.  This  study  indicates  a 
novel  link  between  miRNAs,  oncogenes  and  glutamine 
metabolism, presumably to provide alternative and quick 
ATP sources of glucose metabolism in cancers [30]. Thus, 
in  schwannomas,  elevated  miR-23b  might  also  block 

that  miR-23b  downregulation 

resulted

alternate ATP sources, but in this case serving to reduce the 
rate of proliferation of these benign tumor cells. Another 
interesting potential tumor suppressor miRNA in cancer, 
miR-29 was also found to be upregulated in schwannomas. 
The  downregulation  of  miR-29  and  upregulation  of  its 
oncogenic  targets,  Tcl1  (T-cell  leukemia/lymphoma  1), 
Mcl1 (an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member) and DNA 
methyltransferase  (DNMT3),  have  been  implicated  in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, cholangio-carcinoma and 
lung cancer as a means of blocking tumor cell apoptosis 
and  silencing  tumor  suppressor  genes  [31,32].  Again 
upregulation  of  this  miR29  may  serve  to  attenuate  the 
growth  of  benign  schwannomas.  In  summary,  several 
previously  known  downregulated  “tumor  suppressor 
miRNAs” in malignant tumors, such as let-7d, miR-451, 
miR-23a,  and  miR-29  were  found  to  be  upregulated  in 
schwannomas.  Based  on  these  observations  and  given 
the  fact  that  let-7d,  let-7b,  and  let-7g  tumor  suppressor 
miRNAs  are  also  upregulated  in  benign  meningiomas 
[27], it seems likely that these miRNAs may function at 
transition stages in cancer, at least for schwannoma and 
meningioma tumors, between benign and malignant states 
by differential regulation of certain oncogenic pathways. 
So far, there has been no any mouse knockout studies for 
those miRNAs. It will be interesting to see whether loss 
of any of these malignant tumor suppressor miRNA can 
initiate tumor formation or promote malignant tumors in 
mice.  Our  miRNA  profile  comparison  studies  between 
benign  (WHO  grade  I),  atypical  (WHO  grade  II)  and 
malignant (WHO grade III) in meningiomas showed that 
several  tumor  suppressor  miRNAs  such  as  let-7  family 
members become downregulated in the transition between 
a  benign  state  and  a  malignant  state,  while  potential 
oncogenic  miRNAs  such  as  miR-21  are  upregulated 
in  this  transition  (O.  Saydam,  unpublished  data).  It 
remains to be explored whether these miRNAs are also 
upregulated in other types of benign tumors during this 
transition. The  status  of  potential  and  confirmed  targets 
of  these  upregulated  miRNAs  in  schwannomas  and 
meningioma, such as members of the Ras family, p53 or 
other oncogenic pathways also remains to be investigated.

In  our  study  [20],  we  found  that  miR-7  was 
one  of  the  most  downregulated  miRNAs  (~9-fold)  in 
schwannomas compared to control nerves. To investigate 
the  possible  contribution  of  miR-7  to  schwannoma 
growth, we performed gain-of-function studies and found 
that  upregulation  of  miR-7  inhibited  schwannoma  cell 
growth both in culture and in a xenograft tumor model in 
vivo. Moreover, overexpression of miR-7 directly targeted 
and  inhibited  expression  of  Ack1,  Pak1,  and  EGFR  in 
schwannoma cells. A significant inverse correlation was 
also  found  between  miR-7  downregulation  and  Ack1 

and  Pak1  upregulation  in  schwannoma  tumor  samples 
compared to control nerve tissue.

Previously known targets for miR-7 include messages 
for  signaling  proteins,  Pak1  [33]  and  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptor  (EGFR)  [34],  known  to  be  activated  in 
many forms of cancer. Epidermal growth factor receptor 
is  overexpressed,  amplified  or  mutationally  activated 
in  glioma,  breast,  lung,  esophageal,  and  head  and  neck 
cancers  [35].  Paks  play  an  essential  role  in  a  variety 
of  cellular  functions  including  cell  division,  survival, 
angiogenesis, growth factor signaling and cell migration 
[36]. Overexpression of Paks has been detected in many 
cancers, such as glioma and breast cancer and linked to 
increased invasion and metastasis [37,38]. 

A  new  target  for  miR-7,  found  in  our  study, 
associated  cdc42  kinase  1  (Ack1)  is  a  non-receptor 
protein  tyrosine  kinase  [39],  and  the  gene  encoding 
Ack1 has been recently shown to be amplified in breast, 
esophageal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer 
[40]. In a recent study, the role of Ack1 in migration and 
invasion of breast cancer cells was found to correlate with 
preservation of EGFR expression in vitro [41]. In prostate 
cancer, Ack1 stimulates prostate tumorigenesis in part by 
negatively regulating the proapoptotic tumor suppressor, 
the WW domain containing oxidoreductase (Wwox) [42]. 
Ack1 interacts with Wwox and triggers its ubiquitination 
and degradation. The same study also provided evidence 
supporting  an  oncogenic  role  of  Ack1  in  vivo  -  Ack1 
overexpression promoted anchorage-independent growth 
in culture and tumor growth in vivo [42]. It remains to be 
investigated how upregulation of Ack1 by decreased miR-
7 contributes to schwannoma tumorigenesis.

A recent study showed that miR-7 inhibited EGFR 
and Akt signaling by directly targeting the EGFR mRNA 
and  the  3’UTR  of  IRS-1  and  IRS-2,  which  function  as 
upstream regulators of the Akt pathway [34,43]. Another 
study  demonstrated  that  Pak1  mRNA  is  also  a  target 
for  miR-7,  with  upregulation  of  this  miRNA  leading  to 
degradation of Pak1 mRNA in transformed HeLa, ZR-75, 
and HEK 293 cells [33]. Taken together, our results and 
other reports [33,34] support the function of miR-7 as a 
potential tumor suppressor in tumors, including malignant 
gliomas  and  benign  schwannomas.  Overexpression  and 
activation  of  Pak1  has  been  detected  in  many  cancers 
[44],  including  schwannomas  [45,46;  see  review  36]. 
Since the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is deleted in most 
schwannomas  and  its  gene  product,  merlin  inhibits 
Pak1  activation  in  several  cell  lines,  including  a  mouse 
fibroblastic  line,  NIH  3T3  and  a  rat  schwannoma  cell 
line,  RT4-DP6  [45,46],  it  seems  very  probable  that 
Pak1  activation  is  critical  in  schwannoma  formation. 
Additional  mechanisms  to  activate  Pak1,  for  example, 
via  downregulation  of  miR-7  may  also  contribute  to 
tumorigenesis.

schwannoma  growth,  suggests  alternative  strategies 
and  rationale  for  the  development  of  new  therapies 
for  these  tumors  based  on  overexpression  of  miR-7  or 
inhibition  of  Ack1,  Pak1,  and  EGFR  pathways.  Given 
the  fact  that  schwannomas,  as  many  other  cancers,  are 
not always responsive to anti-EGFR treatment [48], our 
study suggests that Pak1 and/or Ack1 may prove critical 
therapeutic targets for schwannomas.
