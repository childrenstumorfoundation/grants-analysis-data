SUMMARY

In NF1 patients,

Patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and
Costello syndrome Rasopathy have behavioral deﬁ-
cits.
these may correlate with
white matter enlargement and aberrant myelin.
To model these features, we induced Nf1 loss or
HRas hyperactivation in mouse oligodendrocytes.
Enlarged brain white matter tracts correlated with
myelin decompaction, downregulation of claudin-
11, and mislocalization of connexin-32. Surprisingly,
non-cell-autonomous defects in perivascular astro-
cytes and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) developed,
implicating a soluble mediator. Nitric oxide (NO)
can disrupt tight junctions and gap junctions, and
NO and NO synthases (NOS1–NOS3) were upregu-
lated in mutant white matter. Treating mice with the
NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or
the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine corrected cellular
phenotypes. CNP-HRasG12V mice also displayed
locomotor hyperactivity, which could be rescued by
antioxidant treatment. We conclude that Nf1/Ras
regulates oligodendrocyte NOS and that dysregu-
lated NO signaling in oligodendrocytes can alter the
surrounding vasculature. The data suggest that anti-
oxidants may improve some behavioral deﬁcits in
Rasopathy patients.

INTRODUCTION

Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming glial cells of the CNS.
Changes in myelination have recently been implicated in CNS
sensory and motor control, and in cognition (Zatorre et al.,

2012). However, the role of oligodendrocytes and myelin in ge-
netic diseases in which myelination changes have been impli-
cated and cognitive deﬁcits exist, as in Rasopathies such as
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Costello syndrome, has
not been studied.

Rasopathies are inherited disorders in which individuals have
mutations in Ras signaling pathway genes. Activating mutations
in Ras proteins themselves, as in Costello syndrome (caused
by mutations in H-Ras), or inactivation of Ras-GAPs, as in NF1
patients (caused by mutations in the NF1 gene), result in aber-
rant signaling to Ras effectors (Gysin et al., 2011). Low-grade
pilocytic astrocytomas arise in white matter tracts in about
20% of NF1 patients (Williams et al., 2009). Results from diffusion
tensor MRI (DTI) suggest that global changes occur in the brains
of NF1 patients (van Engelen et al., 2008; Karlsgodt et al., 2012).
T2 hyperintense regions in NF1 patients’ brains correlate with
more profound DTI changes. On pathological analysis, these
T2 hyperintense spots may be regions of dysmyelination
(DiPaolo et al., 1995) and in some studies have been correlated
with behavioral changes in NF1 patients (Hyman et al., 2007).
More than half of NF1 patients present with CNS defects,
learning and memory deﬁcits, and/or hyperactivity (Acosta
et al., 2012). Although the cellular changes that cause these def-
icits remain to be determined, more than half of NF1 patients are
affected by macrocephaly, and increased size of the corpus cal-
losum is associated with behavioral deﬁcits (Pride et al., 2010).
NF1 protein is highly expressed in rodent and human oligoden-
drocytes (Daston et al., 1992); therefore, we speculated that
NF1 loss in oligodendrocytes could play a role in both the path-
ology and physiology of brain dysfunction in NF1 patients. The
brain histology in Costello syndrome has not been studied, but
macrocephaly followed by microcephaly, seizures, and cogni-
tive problems has been reported, as has dysmyelination of
optic nerves and basal ganglia based on brain imaging (Tidyman
and Rauen, 2008). Costello mutations include the severe
HRasG12V mutation, which we modeled.

In this study, we examined the effects of Nf1 loss and
hyperactivation of HRas (HRasG12V) on oligodendrocytes in
the adult brain. We identiﬁed a Ras-nitric oxide (NO) pathway
that mediates altered myelin structure. Several lines of evidence
have suggested key roles for reactive oxygen and nitrogen as
upstream regulators and downstream effectors of Ras signaling
(Ferro et al., 2012). Ras signaling through the downstream effec-
tors MEK/ERK induces the generation of reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS)
(Heimfarth et al., 2013). Furthermore, MEK has
been shown to play a critical role in oligodendrocyte formation
(Li et al., 2012), and developmental Nf1 loss throughout the brain
resulted in corpus callosum enlargement that could be reduced
in size by MEK inhibition (Wang et al., 2012). However,
in
Drosophila, dNf1 loss caused a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-induced,
Ras-independent upregulation of ROS (Tong et al., 2007). How
loss of Nf1 affects oligodendrocyte viability and/or function
remains unknown.

Oligodendrocytes manufacture myelin. Compact myelin is a
multilamellar membrane whose structural
integrity depends
upon identiﬁed proteins and lipids. In addition to the major myelin
proteins, such as proteolipid protein (Plp), myelin contains gap
junction (GJ) and tight junction (TJ) proteins. Oligodendrocyte-
speciﬁc protein (OSP; claudin-11) is a TJ protein. Claudin-11
mutants showed myelin decompaction in concert with Plp muta-
tion (Chow et al., 2005). Genetic loss of the oligodendrocyte
connexin protein Cx32 in mice results in myelin vacuolization
(Magnotti et al., 2011). Claudins and connexins can be regulated
by MEK/ERK or NO (Lee et al., 2009; Radosinska et al., 2011;
Beutheu et al., 2012); however, such regulation has not been
studied in intact brains.

We ﬁnd that cell-intrinsic Ras upregulation in oligoden-
drocytes deregulates the expression and/or localization of TJ
and GJ proteins in the myelin sheath, and, unexpectedly, in
astrocyte and endothelial cells,
resulting in altered per-
meability of
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically,
cellular phenotypes were caused by Ras-driven upregulation
of NO synthase (NOS) expression and NO production. Behav-
ioral changes also resulted from altered Ras/NO signaling in
oligodendrocytes.

RESULTS

PlpCre;ERT (PlpCre) and CNP-HRasG12V Model
Systems Target Mature Oligodendrocytes
To target Nf1 loss to oligodendrocytes, we used a tamoxifen-
inducible PLP driver (Doerﬂinger et al., 2003). Plp is mainly
expressed in adult white matter oligodendrocytes, but cellular
targets of this driver have not been completely deﬁned. We
analyzed PlpCre;CMV-bactin-loxP-EGFP ﬂanked (CAT) mice
1 day after they were dosed with tamoxifen for 3 days. The
schematic in Figure S1 shows the oligodendrocyte lineage. As
expected, enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP)+ cell
labeling was enriched in white matter. We analyzed the optic
nerve and corpus callosum in detail. Twenty percent of optic-
nerve cells were EGFP+ and thus were affected by Cre recombi-
nase. All EGFP+ cells in the optic nerve were double labeled with
CC1 (Figure S1A), and 35% of the CC1+ population was double
labeled with EGFP. In the corpus callosum, 75%–80% of EGFP+

cells were CC1+ (Figure S1A), likely indicating variable expres-
sion of CC1 in mature oligodendrocytes (Zeger et al., 2007).
EGFP+ cells in white matter were negative for the progenitor
marker NG2 (Figure S1B). Most EGFP+ cells had olig2+ nuclei
(Figure S1C) and were CC1+ (Figure S1D). Cells expressing the
astrocyte marker glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Figure S1E),
the microglial marker Iba1 (Figure S1F), and the endothelial cell
marker tomato lectin (Figure S1G) were EGFP . No axons in
the optic nerve or corpus callosum were EGFP+. Scattered neu-
rons in the granule cell layers of the hippocampus and cere-
bellum were EGFP+, as were rare interneurons of the olfactory
bulb (not shown).

The cellularity of optic-nerve cross-sections in hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E)-stained parafﬁn sections did not change, and
there was no increase in cell proliferation as assessed by bromo-
deoxyuridine (BrdU) or Ki67/EGFP+, or cell death as assessed
by TUNEL/caspase-3 immunohistochemistry (not shown).
Furthermore, cell counts for NG2 and CC1 did not change in
the optic nerve or corpus callosum (Figures S1H and S1I).
Olig2 cell counts did increase in the corpus callosum, as
expected from previous studies (Wang et al., 2012).

To mimic a severe form of Costello syndrome, we used a
hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CNP-HRasG12V mouse model
(CNP-HRas). In this mouse, Ras-GTP is constitutively expressed
(Figure S2A) as predicted for this G12V allele (Gysin et al., 2011;
Patel et al., 2012). Immunohistochemical analysis conﬁrmed HA
staining primarily in the white matter of CNP-HRas animals (Fig-
ure S2C), which was absent in wild-type (WT) brain (Figure S2B).
In the corpus callosum, the HA tag localized primarily to cell
processes (Figure S2D). Verifying HA-Ras expression in mature
oligodendrocytes, MAG+ ad-axonal membranes showed exten-
sive overlap with the HA tag (Figure S2E) and MBP+ compact
myelin was partly colocalized (Figure S2F). Astrocytes did not
express HRasG12V (Figure S2G).

Nf1 Loss or HRas Activation in Oligodendrocytes Causes
Optic-Nerve Enlargement, Myelin Decompaction, Loss
of Claudin-11, and Altered Connexin 32 Localization
To test whether white matter structure is altered by Nf1 loss or
Ras activation, we examined the brains of PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ mice
exposed to tamoxifen at 2 months of age, and CNP-HRas mice
(n = 5/genotype). Optic nerves were enlarged in PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ,
and CNP-HRas mice at 12 months compared with WT animals
(Figures 1A and 1B; quantiﬁcation in Figure S3; p < 0.001), and
the corpus callosum was enlarged in the PLPCre model (Figures
S3C and S3D; p = 0.8 3 10

 7).

To explain the increases in optic-nerve size, we performed
electron microscopy. In normal nerves, myelin sheath thickness
is proportional to the diameter of a wrapped axon. Pathological
changes in myelin thickness can be quantiﬁed via a g-ratio
analysis. A g-ratio analysis shows the extent of myelin disrup-
tion and the prevalence of the myelin abnormalities in >5,000
axons per genotype, and unbiased counting of myelinated
axons in optic-nerve sections revealed signiﬁcantly shifted g-
ratios after loss of Nf1 or hyperactivation of HRas (Figure 1C).
The g-ratios in mutant optic nerves shifted both to the right and
down, indicating increased axonal diameter and myelin thick-
ness in Nf1-deﬁcient and HRasG12V mutant mice. In mutant

animals, 35% of myelinated axons had g-ratios < 0.5;
in
contrast, 0.01% of WT ﬁbers had g-ratios < 0.5. Analysis of
electron micrographs showed that myelin in mutants was
expanded due to splitting/decompaction of myelin lamellae
rather than an increase in the number of lamellae. In cross-
section, compact myelin is composed of major dense lines
(compressed cytoplasm) and intraperiod lines composed of
adjacent plasma membranes (see model
in Figure 1D).
After Nf1 loss or HRas-GTP expression in oligodendrocytes,
the intraperiod lines were separated by extracellular space
(Figure 1E).

Myelin decompaction can occur due to alterations in myelin,

-phosphodiesterase (CNP) and PLP showed no sig-
niﬁcant changes in concentration (Figure 1F). The myelin basic
protein (MBP) protein 24 kDa band decreased with a corre-
sponding increase in 14 and 18 kDa bands, possibly reﬂecting
changes in isoform expression. TJs span compact myelin layers
(see schematic in Figure 1D). Claudin-11 levels in optic-nerve
lysates were reduced after Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression
(Figure 1G).

Because claudin-11 loss alone is insufﬁcient to explain the
observed myelin decompaction, we analyzed the GJ protein
connexin 32 (Cx32), which is normally found at myelin interperiod
lines (Ahn et al., 2008). Cx32 messenger RNA (mRNA) was un-
changed (not shown). Cx32 protein was increased in optic-nerve
lysates after Nf1 loss or hyperactivation of HRas (Figure 1H). To
deﬁne Cx32 distribution, we fractioned brain membranes by
density centrifugation.
In WT brains, Cx32 was enriched in
myelin, whereas after Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression, Cx32
was concentrated in plasma membrane/endosomal fractions
(Figure 1I). Band shifts characteristic of phosphorylated and
dimerized Cx32 proteins were also present in mutant cyto-
plasmic fractions.

Correlates of increased axon diameter can include alterations
in mitochondria in affected axons. Conﬁrming our g-ratio anal-
ysis, electron microscopy displayed enlarged axons that may
contribute to enlarged white matter tracts (Figure S4A). Because
Ras has been shown to directly regulate mitochondria, it is inter-
esting to note that in some axons in PLP;Nf1ﬂoxed (not shown) or
CNP-HRas animals, mitochondria were more numerous, present
near noncompact myelin, or showed abnormal cristae (Figures
S4B and S4C). Neuronal cell death, as indicated by cleaved
caspase3+ in cell bodies, was present in the retinal ganglion
cell layer of mutants (Figure S4D).

GJs Are Lost in Enlarged Astrocyte Endfeet after Nf1
Loss or HRas Activation
Increased myelin sheath diameters partially accounted for optic-
nerve enlargement. Electron microscopy also revealed aber-
rantly wide perivascular space surrounding the capillaries in
mutant optic nerves (Figure 2A; quantiﬁcation in Figure 2C).
The expanded perivascular space contained enlarged astrocyte
endfeet surrounding endothelial cells (Figure 2B). These swollen
endfeet contain increased numbers of mitochondria (not shown),
indicating a possible shift in metabolic load at these sites. In WT
brains, adjacent astrocyte endfoot membranes contain GJs
composed of Cx43 (Simard et al., 2003). GJs appear as charac-
teristic electron-dense plaques at opposed astrocyte mem-
branes (Figure 2B, red arrows: GJ). In contrast to the WT brain,
electron-dense plaques were rarely observed in astrocyte end-
feet surrounding optic-nerve capillaries after Nf1 loss or HRas
activation (Figure 2B, arrowheads; quantiﬁcation in Figure 2D).
Reductions in visible GJs at astrocyte endfeet could result
from changes in Cx43, which is astrocyte speciﬁc in the brain.
Quantitative RT-PCR did not show changes in Cx43 mRNA
expression (not shown). Cx43 protein was decreased in
PLP;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ or CNP-HRas animals’ optic nerves (Figure 2E), but
was not detectably changed in whole-brain lysates (Figure 2F).
Decreased Cx43 was detectable in oligodendrocyte-rich myelin
tracts, where Nf1/Ras mutant cells are enriched.

Nf1 Loss or HRas Activation in Oligodendrocytes Results
in Changes in Endothelial Claudins and BBB
Permeability
Astrocytes induce endothelial cells to form TJs, which are critical
for the formation of the BBB (Wolburg and Lippoldt, 2002). TJs
appear as continuous electron-dense plaques between endo-
thelial cells in transmission electron micrographs (Figure 3A,
top left). After Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression, TJs were pre-
sent between endothelial membranes but contained gaps. We
found similar gaps in electron micrographs of optic-nerve blood
vessels in a human NF1 autopsy sample (Figure 3A, blue arrow-
heads; quantiﬁcation in Figure 3B). The use of human tissue was
approved by the institutional review board of the Cincinnati Chil-
dren’s Hospital.

To test whether loss of astrocyte endfoot GJs and endothelial
TJ malformations result in functional alterations in the BBB, we
injected Evans blue dye into WT, PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ, and CNP-
HRas mice. As expected, 24 hr later the WT animals displayed
no Evans blue leak. Strikingly, both PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ and

CNP-HRas optic nerves showed residual dye in the perivascular
space (Figure 3C). No detectable Evans blue dye was found in
the parenchyma,
indicating that leakage, but not extensive
BBB disruption, occurred in the capillaries. Western blot analysis
showed downregulation of the BBB TJ protein claudin-1 and loss
of claudin-5 dimer after Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression (Fig-
ure 3D), conﬁrming endothelial TJ impairment. Vasculature ab-
normalities must be non-cell autonomous, as neither the PlpCre
driver nor CNP-HRas was expressed in astrocytes or endothelial
cells.

Optic-Nerve Enlargements Are Not Gliomas
NF1 patients are predisposed to grade 1 pilocytic astrocytomas,
which are frequent along the visual pathway and are character-
ized by optic-nerve enlargement, astrocyte proliferation, angio-
genesis, and deposition of Rosenthal ﬁbers and eosinophilic
granular bodies (Perilongo et al., 2012). None of these features
were present after Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression in oligo-
dendrocytes. GFAP immunohistochemistry of optic-nerve
cross-sections revealed no reactive or neoplastic astrocyte cell
proliferation up to 12 months after tamoxifen injection (Fig-
ure S5A). Although there was a signiﬁcant increase in the number
of blood vessels per optic-nerve cross-section in the PLP;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ

and CNP-HRas mice (not shown), it was not signiﬁcant after
normalization to the nerve area (Figure S5B). The cellularity of
optic-nerve cross-sections in H&E-stained parafﬁn sections
did not change, and there was no increase in cell proliferation
as assessed by BrdU or Ki67/EGFP+ immunohistochemistry
(not shown). H&E analysis of optic-nerve sections (cross and lon-
gitudinal) revealed one case of focal, inﬁltrating optic glioma
without the presence of inﬂammatory cells or increased reactive
gliosis (not shown); however, this was very rare (n = 1/60).

Despite the absence of proliferating EGFP+ cells at 12 months
after tamoxifen injection, EGFP+ cells remained numerous in
PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ;EGFP+ animals, but diminished over time in
PLPCre;Nf1WT;EGFP+ optic nerve (Figure S5C). EGFP+ cells
were present along the ventricular walls, where many migratory
NG2+ progenitor cells are normally found. Immunohistochem-
istry revealed NG2+/EGFP+ double-positive cells in the subven-
tricular zone of PlpCre animals (Figure S5D). This may explain
the persistence of EGFP+ cells in the mutant optic nerves long
after tamoxifen exposure, as NG2+, Nf1+/ , and Nf1 /  pro-
genitors proliferate more than their WT counterparts and
NG2+ progenitors migrate from the third ventricle to the optic
nerves during development (Bennett et al., 2003; Hegedus
et al., 2007).

Myelin Decompaction and TJ and GJ Cellular Changes
Resulting from Oligodendrocyte-Speciﬁc Ras Activation
Are NO Dependent
The identiﬁcation of non-cell-autonomous changes in astrocytes
and endothelial cells after loss of Nf1 or HRasG12V expression in
oligodendrocytes prompted us to consider whether a secreted
Ras-dependent effector molecule might be produced by mutant
oligodendrocytes. We focused on ROS because increased ROS
can affect the BBB (Komatsu et al., 1999), and ROS was impli-
cated downstream of Ras (Ferro et al., 2012) and Nf1 (Tong

et al., 2007). ROS include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide
O2-, and NO. NO is an important signaling molecule that is syn-
thesized inside cells from L-arginine, oxygen, and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) by mammalian NOS
(NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3). Inside target cells, NO activates gua-
nylate cyclase, oxidizes, ADP ribosylates, and nitrosylates pro-
teins, DNA, and lipids. All three NOS proteins were upregulated
in optic-nerve lysates after Nf1 loss or HRasG12V expression
(Figure 4A). ROS reaction products were also signiﬁcantly
increased in the CNP-HRas optic nerves (Figure 4B) and were

diminished by preincubation with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-
arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; Figure 4B, bottom), indicating
the contribution of NO species.

To test whether the cellular phenotypes identiﬁed were caused
by upregulation of NOS, CNP-HRas animals were administered
L-NAME for 7 days and then the optic nerves were processed
for electron microscopy. L-NAME rescued abnormal g-ratios
(Figures 4C and 4D), perivascular area (Figures 4G and 4H),
astrocyte GJs (Figures 4I and 4J), and endothelial TJs (Figures
4K and 4L). However, L-NAME administration for 7 days failed
to rescue the increases in axon diameter (Figures 4E and 4F).
Similar results were obtained in PLP;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ animals (not shown).

Nf1 Haploinsufﬁciency in Oligodendrocytes Causes
Myelin and Vascular Phenotypes
Most NF1 patients are heterozygous for the NF1 mutation; there-
fore, we examined whether heterozygous loss mimicked the
myelin and/or vascular phenotypes identiﬁed in PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ
and CNP-HRas models. Optic nerves were signiﬁcantly enlarged
in PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/+ animals (Figures 5A and 5B; p < 0.0001),
in Nf1+/  animals (p = 0.41). Both Nf1+/  and
but not
PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/+ mice showed myelin g-ratio changes (Figure 5C),
myelin decompaction with concurrent axonal enlargement (see
Figure S7), Cx32 protein mislocalization (not shown), increased
perivascular space with enlarged astrocyte endfeet (Figures 5D
and 5E), and endothelial TJ disruptions (Figure 5F). On a molec-
ular level, the heterozygotes showed increased NOS (NOS1–
NOS3) protein expression in optic-nerve lysates (Figure 5G)
and downregulation of optic-nerve Cx43 (Figure 5H).

Myelin Decompaction and Perivascular Changes Are
Also Found in the Corpus Callosum after Nf1
Haploinsufﬁciency or HRas Activation
The corpus callosum is enlarged in many NF1 patients. We
examined electron micrographs from Nf1+/ , PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/+,
PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ, and CNP-HRas animals, and found myelin decom-
paction at intraperiod lines, expanded perivascular space with loss
of GJs at astrocyte endfeet (blue arrows), and changes in endothe-
lial TJ (not shown; Figure S6). The data were conﬁrmed by g-ratio
analysis (not shown). Thus, Nf1 loss or HRasG12V in oligodendro-
cytes also affects hemispheric white matter. Corpus callosum size
was measured from parafﬁn coronal sections at the level of rostral
anterior commissure from three to seven animals per genotype.
The corpus callosum of PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/+ and PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ animals
was signiﬁcantly increased when compared with WT controls

Generation of Increased ROS Is Intrinsic
to Oligodendrocytes
To determine which cell population(s) had increased ROS,
we dissociated cells from the forebrain and optic nerve of
PLP;Nf1ﬂ+;eGFP mice (6 months after tamoxifen injection). We
monitored the ﬂuorescent ROS reporter 2
-dichlorodihydro-
ﬂuorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) by ﬂow cytometry. There was
no signiﬁcant shift in DCF-DA ﬂuorescence intensity (p = 0.74)
or total live DCF-DA+ CNS resident cells (p = 0.51), although
an increase was observed in some individual mutant mice (Fig-
ure 6A). We used gates to discriminate cell types (Figure 6B,
top two rows). Importantly, a signiﬁcant increase (p = 0.05) in
DCF-DA ﬂuorescence intensity was present in sorted GalC+
oligodendrocytes after Nf1 loss (Figure 6B, bottom row). In
contrast, platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa)+
progenitors, GFAP+ astrocytes, intercellular adhesion molecule
1 (ICAM1)+ endothelial cells, and CD45+ blood cells/microglia
in the mutant brains showed similar ROS compared with WT
cells. Because EGFP expression is Cre driven, most sorted
EGFP+ cells from PlpCre;Nf1ﬂ/+ mice are Nf1 mutant, and
EGFP  cells are WT. Strikingly, there was a signiﬁcant increase
in Cell ROX Orange ROS reporter ﬂuorescence intensity in both
EGFP+ recombined (p = 0.01) and EGFP  (p = 0.001) GalC+
oligodendrocytes after Nf1 loss (Figure 6C). The GFP  popula-
tion was larger (p = 0.005) than that of GFP+ recombined cells,
likely reﬂecting the larger number of total gated cells. Overall,
the data indicate that Nf1 loss results in ROS accumulation in
mutant oligodendrocytes. ROS also accumulates in other oligo-
dendrocytes, possibly those coupled directly by GJs.

The Antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine Rescues Myelin and
Vascular Phenotypes in PLP;Nf1ﬂoxed and CNP-HRas
Mice
Available inhibitors of NOS are broad spectrum and/or affect
subsets of synthases. We tested a broad-spectrum antioxidant
that is not speciﬁc for NOS, but can be used in vivo for prolonged
periods. We administered the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC; 0.001% in drinking water) to PLP;Nf1ﬂ/+, PLP;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ,
and CNP-HRas animals. In the PLP models, NAC was adminis-
tered 6–8 months after tamoxifen injection. In CNP-HRas mice,
NAC was administered beginning at 10 weeks of age. In each
case, phenotypes were rescued by 6 weeks of NAC expo-
sure—completely in CNP-HRas mice and to a lesser extent in

Nf1 mutants. Optic-nerve diameter was rescued (Figure 7A) and
g-ratios normalized in all strains (Figure 7B). Perivascular space
was rescued (Figure 7D), as were GJs in astrocyte endfeet (Fig-
ure 7E). Myelin compaction was also rescued in all strains
(Figure S7). Changes in axon diameter (Figure 7C) and TJ
gaps (Figure 7F) varied among the animals and were not signiﬁ-
cant when compiled for PLP;Nf1ﬂ/+ or PLP;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ mice; howev-
er, Evans blue staining showed no BBB leak in the optic nerve in
any mutant model after NAC administration (not shown).

CNP-HRas Animals Have Hyperactive Locomotion and
Hypersensitivity to Startle
Changes in myelin have recently been correlated with changes in
behavior, and NF1 and Costello syndrome patients are known to
display frequent behavioral deﬁcits;
therefore, we tested
whether behavior was altered in mice with elevated Ras-GTP
in oligodendrocytes. Because the PLP;Nf1ﬂox;eGFP mouse
lines were on a mixed strain background, we focused behavioral
experiments on the CNP-HRas animals on a pure C57Bl/6 back-
ground. CNP-HRas animals were hyperactive in a locomotor
task (Figure 8A, p = 0.045) and swam faster in the cued Morris
water maze (Figure 8B, p = 0.01) as compared with littermate
controls. They also showed a trend toward a hyperreactive star-
tle response (Figure 8C, p < 0.07). No signiﬁcant differences
were noted in parallel bars, tremor, or in the learning and memory
phases of the Morris water maze (not shown). NAC exposure
increased locomotor activity in the WT mice, correlating with
myelin decompaction, GJ and TJ changes, and Evans blue
BBB leak (not shown), indicating that high antioxidant exposure
in normal animals without high ROS levels can be detrimental. In
contrast, 6 weeks of NAC treatment decreased locomotor activ-
ity in the CNP-HRas mice by 30.8%, bringing them below control
levels (p < 0.01). NAC normalized swim speed in the cued Morris
maze, but did not modify the startle response in these mice.
Thus, behavioral changes induced by Ras upregulation in oligo-
dendrocytes are partially reversible by antioxidant therapy.

DISCUSSION

We generated a CNP-HRasG12V mouse model to examine the
role of HRas activation in oligodendrocytes. A striking gross
abnormality in Ras mutant brain was enlargement of optic
nerves. This ﬁnding extended to the PLPCreERT;Nf1ﬂoxed
mouse models, consistent with the idea that the cellular effects
of Nf1 loss of function in adult myelin are mediated through
Ras activation. This enlargement of white matter is consistent
with previously reported white matter enlargement and macro-
cephaly in NF1 patients, which lacked a cellular or molecular
explanation (Pride et al., 2010; Karlsgodt et al., 2012). We ﬁnd
that Ras pathway activation in oligodendrocytes upregulates
NOS and elevates oligodendrocyte ROS, including NO. NO

modulates TJ and GJ proteins in oligodendrocytes and in sur-
rounding astrocytes and endothelial cells, affecting brain perme-
ability and contributing to behavioral abnormalities. These data
provide a potential cellular and molecular mechanism of Rasop-
athy brain abnormalities. It will be of interest to closely examine
the brains of Rasopathy patients for white matter enlargement
and the cellular features we have identiﬁed.

Using inducible Plp-Cre, we targeted loss of Nf1 to mature
adult oligodendrocytes. Similar phenotypes developed as
compared with the CNP-HRas model in which oligodendrocytes
were affected beginning during development. Given our ability to
rescue phenotypes in both models during adulthood, the data
argue that these brain defects are not developmental in origin.
These data are consistent with ﬁndings that learning defects
can be rescued in adult mice with Nf1 mutations (Li et al.,
2005). Wang et al. (2012) rescued enlarged corpus callosum
size with MEK inhibitors administered from birth to postnatal
day 18. Our data support the idea that critical defects can be
rescued after they form, even into adulthood.

Some differences between the Plp-Cre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ and CNP-HRas
models were observed. Although all cellular phenotypes were
detected in both models, the corpus callosum was not signiﬁ-
cantly enlarged in the CNP-HRas mice. In Costello syndrome,
the brain can atrophy. It remains possible that the size of the
corpus callosum in our mouse model changed with the age of
animals studied. Also, although NAC exposure rescued g-ratios,
GJs, and perivascular abnormalities in both models, axon diam-
eter was rescued in the CNP-HRas model but not in the Plp-
Cre;Nf1 model. These differences may be caused by the fact
that H-Ras is constitutively GTP loaded in CNP-HRas oligoden-
drocytes, whereas Ras loading in Nf1 mutants, including oligo-
dendrocyte lineage cells, can have elevated basal Ras-GTP
yet also maintain cytokine/growth factor responsiveness (Ben-
nett et al., 2003). In addition, loss of Nf1 protein is predicted to
activate all Ras proteins, whereas only H-Ras should be acti-
vated in CNP-HRasG12V mice.

Patients with NF1 are predisposed to develop grade 1 pilo-
cytic optic-nerve gliomas. In humans, and especially in NF1
patients, some pilocytic tumors grow while others do not. At pre-
sent, MRI optic-nerve enlargement alone is diagnostic for optic
glioma in NF1 patients (Perilongo et al., 2012). Our results identify
a potential mechanism that may underlie optic-nerve enlarge-
ment in some patients who do not progress to tumors, and
suggest that optic-nerve enlargement may not be sufﬁcient for
glioma diagnosis. The use of an antioxidant might provide ther-
apeutic options to these patients and at least partially reduce
nerve size.

Nf1 loss or HRas activation in oligodendrocytes did not cause
optic glioma, and the mice did not display cytological atypia or
increased astrocyte proliferation characteristic of pilocytic astro-
cytoma. NG2-Cre-mediated inactivation of Nf1 also did not

cause mouse optic glioma (Solga et al., 2013). Our PLPCre;
Nf1ﬂoxed and CNP-HRas mouse models were similar to GFAP-
Cre;Nf1ﬂ/  mice, with optic-nerve enlargement and myelin
disorganization (Kim et al., 2010). GFAP-Cre;Nf1ﬂ/  mice have
loss of Nf1 in most or all of their brain cells. The enlarged optic
nerve and disruption of myelin sheaths that are features of all
three models are likely caused by defects in oligodendrocytes.
Our identiﬁcation of cell-autonomous Nf1/Ras contributions in
oligodendrocytes represents a ﬁrst step in deﬁning how speciﬁc
cell types contribute to optic-nerve enlargement in NF1 patients.
Changes in the brain structure of NF1 patients can be global,
and possibly caused by mutation in a single Nf1 allele (van Enge-
len et al., 2008; Karlsgodt et al., 2012). It is therefore relevant that
myelin decompaction, swollen perivascular astrocyte endfeet,
and TJ integrity phenotypes were identiﬁed in PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/+
and PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ mice. Nf1+/  mice also showed these phe-
notypes, although they were less frequent than in PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/+,
PLPCre;Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ, or CNP-HRasG12V mice. Nf1+/  optic nerves
also did not show signiﬁcant enlargement. We speculate that
Nf1+/  cells outside the oligodendrocyte lineage limit these

phenotypes, possibly by scavenging excess extracellular
reactive oxygen.

Cell-autonomous myelin decompaction correlated with a
reduction in the TJ protein claudin-11 and mislocalization of
the GJ protein Cx32. We identiﬁed Cx32 band shifts character-
istic of phosphorylated and dimerized Cx32 proteins, which
target Cx32 into endosomes and decrease GJ assembly (Segre-
tain and Falk, 2004). Because claudin-11-KO alone is insufﬁcient
for myelin decompaction, our data support a role for the com-
bined loss of claudin-11 and Cx32 in myelin decompaction.

and cardiofaciocutaneous

Rasopathy patients, including those with Costello, Noonan,
LEOPARD,
syndromes
and NF1, can have heart and/or bone abnormalities (Tidyman
and Rauen, 2008). Connexins are vital for normal heart and
bone function (Radosinska et al., 2011; Saura et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2006), and can regulate ROS transfer (Taniguchi
Ishikawa et al., 2012). NO regulates Cx43 through transcriptional
modulation and phosphorylation (Radosinska et al., 2011; Zhang
et al., 2006). For example, NOS inhibition alters Cx43 concentra-
tion and GJ function in cardiomyocytes (Dlugosova et al., 2009),

and NOS (eNOS and iNOS)-KO mice show bone and heart ab-
normalities (Afzal et al., 2004; Saura et al., 2010). Ras regulation
of NOS (with changes in both connexins and claudins) may be
relevant in multiple organ systems in Rasopathy patients.

TJs are present in compact myelin and between brain endo-
thelial cells, where they form the BBB. We focused on the claudin
family of TJ proteins in part because of their expression in pe-
ripheral nerve tumors from NF1 patients (Pummi et al., 2006).
Claudins determine the selectivity of paracellular transport, and
the barrier properties of claudins are regulated by environmental
cues. NO can modulate claudin expression and subcellular tar-
geting, and assembly of claudin-containing TJs (Wolburg and
Lippoldt 2002; reviewed in Angelow et al., 2008). The speciﬁc
properties of claudins modulated by Ras and Nf1 in oligodendro-
cytes and endothelial cells remain to be studied.

By using a new method to dissociate living brain cells and
analyze them by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS),
we showed that only GalC+ oligodendrocytes had elevated
levels of ROS in mutant brains. The oligodendrocyte ROS likely
contains NO, because L-NAME rescued DCF-DA reactivity in
tissue sections and myelin compaction in vivo. L-NAME is an
L-arginine analog, a competitive inhibitor of NOS that is widely
used as a NO inhibitor in cell and animal studies. As with any
inhibitor, off-target effects may limit interpretation. For L-argi-
nine analogs, the described off-target effects are inhibition of
L-arginine transport, resulting in NOS inhibition due to substrate
depletion, and interaction with cellular iron complexes, as in
NOS enzymes, which also result in NO depletion (Robertson
et al., 1993). Finally, regarding speciﬁcity, we note that hyper-
oxia rescued L-NAME-induced limb deﬁcits in an animal model,
limb defects that can be mimicked by eNOS knockout (Tiboni
et al., 2003). In this study, we were able to block DCF-DA ﬂuo-
rescence (which reads out reactive oxygen, NO, and reactive ni-
trogen species) using L-NAME in tissue sections from mutant
mice, supporting our hypothesis that NOS and NO are relevant

to the phenotypes described. However, roles for other ROS
cannot be excluded by these studies. How oligodendrocyte
ROS affects astrocytes and endothelial cells (which lack detect-
able increases in ROS) also remains unclear. Yet, L-NAME
reversed GJ and TJ phenotypes in astrocytes and endothelial
cells in vivo, indicating that blocking NO is sufﬁcient to rescue
these phenotypes. Extracellular NO can alter GJ function in as-
trocytes in vitro in an L-NAME-dependent manner (Gandhi et al.,
2010). ROS may diffuse from oligodendrocytes to affect other
cell types, although it is likely to diffuse only short distances
before being reduced by contact with proteins and lipids. Alter-
natively, NO may diffuse from oligodendrocytes through GJs to
neighboring astrocytes, yet remain below our level of detection
in an astrocyte population analysis.

Viosca et al. (2009) found that mice with germline G12VH-Ras
are hyperactive and show hypersensitivity. We found that CNP-
HRas mice also show locomotor hyperactivity that can be
rescued with antioxidants. Elevation of oxidative stress is
known to cause locomotor hyperactivity in mice (Chen et al.,
2012; Dumont et al., 2011). Increased reactive oxygen and
impaired oxidative balance occur in patients with attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (Selek et al., 2012), suggesting
that ROS may play a role in human hyperactivity. NO may also
play a role in epileptiform hyperactivity, as anticonvulsants
diminish NO levels (Vega Rasgado et al., 2011). It is therefore
relevant that up to 60% of NF1 and Rasopathy patients present
with hyperactivity (Acosta et al., 2012; Tidyman and Rauen,
2008).

Six weeks of NAC treatment increased locomotor activity in
WT mice. Antioxidant treatment in WT mice also opened the
BBB to Evans blue dye and caused some myelin decompaction
with GJ and TJ changes (not shown), indicating that high antiox-
idant treatment in animals without high ROS levels can be detri-
mental. These data support our ﬁnding that reactive oxygen
balance is important for the cellular phenotypes identiﬁed, and

Cell Reports 4, 1197–1212, September 26, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 1209

suggest that antioxidant treatment could be used to temporarily
open the BBB.

In summary, we have identiﬁed a pathway in which increased
Ras-GTP in oligodendrocytes,
through NOS/ROS, disrupts
myelin compaction, TJ and GJs, and BBB permeability, with
behavioral consequences. The relationship among these pheno-
types and the potential for antioxidant therapies for Rasopathy
patients will be important subjects for future studies.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Mice
PlpCreERT; Nf1ﬂ/+; eGFP and PlpCreERT; Nf1ﬂ/ﬂ; eGFP mouse husbandry,
tamoxifen injections, tissue processing, histology, and electron microscopy
were performed as previously described (Mayes et al., 2011). WT and
Nf1+/  were mice backcrossed for >30 generations onto a C57Bl6 back-
ground and genotyped by PCR (Brannan et al., 1994). Transgenic HRASG12V
mice were created using a promoter from the CNP gene (Patel et al., 2012).
Mice were backcrossed for more than eight generations onto a C57Bl/6 back-
ground and maintained on the male.

Antibodies
Cryostat sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and imaged
as previously described (Mayes et al., 2011) with markers for EGFP (GFP
1:2,000; Millipore), oligodendrocytes (Olig2 1:500, Millipore #AB9610; CC1
1:2,000, Calbiochem), progenitor cells (NG2 1:500, Millipore #AB5320),
astrocytes (GFAP 1:500, Millipore #MAB360 or 1:1,000 DAKO), microglia
(Iba1 1:2,000, Wako #019-19741), and neurons (NeuN 1:500, Chemicon
#MAB377). Anti-Ki67 (1:250, Leica Novocastra #KI67P-CE) was used to deter-
mine cell proliferation. For HA staining, we used an anti-HA-epitope tag (1:200,
Cell Signaling #2350S).

g-Ratio Analysis
g-Ratios were determined by dividing the diameter of each axon by the diam-
eter of the same axon together with its myelin sheath in 1,000–2,000 axons per
animal (n = 3–5 per genotype) using ImageJ software.

Western Blots
Optic nerves (n = 3–5 animals/genotype) were individually lysed and sonicated
in 200 ml lysis buffer on ice and then clariﬁed by centrifugation. Protein (30–
50 mg) was separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient
gels (4%–20%; ISC BioExpress) and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membrane (BioRad). Membranes were probed with antibodies against myelin
basic protein (SMI-99, 1:2,000, Calbiochem #NE1019), CNP (1:1,000, Cell
Signaling Technologies 5664), PLP (1:2,000, Aves Labs), eNOS (1:1,000, Cell
Signaling Technologies #9586S), iNOS (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies
#2977S), nNOS (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies #4231S), connexin 32
(1:500, Invitrogen #138200), connexin 43 (1:100, Invitrogen #710700), clau-
din-1 (1:200, Invitrogen #71-7800), claudin-5 (1:1,000, Invitrogen #34-1600),
and claudin-11 (1:1,000, Invitrogen #36-4500). They were then reprobed with
anti-b-actin (1:5,000, Cell Signaling Technologies #4967) or MEK1/2 (1:1,000,
Cell Signaling Technologies #4694S) as loading controls. Digitized blots were
inverted and band intensities were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software.

Ras Activation Assay
Adult brains were homogenized on ice and levels of activated Ras were deter-
mined using a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotech) in which Ras-GTP
was assayed using the GST-tagged Ras-binding domain of Raf1 (Raf-RBD)
as an afﬁnity reagent.

Myelin Fractionation
The animals were euthanized and fresh brains were dissected immediately on
ice, weighed, ﬁnely minced, and homogenized (1 g tissue/10 ml buffer: 0.32 M
sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 8.5 mM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl ﬂuoride)
with a dounce homogenizer (seven strokes each, with ﬁrst a loose and then

tant from this spin was respun at 100,000 g for 1 hr at 4
Total lysate was layered over steps of 0.32, 0.85 M, and 1.2 M sucrose, and
spun in a BeckmanCoulter Optima L-look ultracentrifuge at 75,000 g for
C. Myelin membranes were collected at the 0.32 M/0.85 M sucrose
30 min at 4
interface with a Pasteur pipette. Plasma membrane was collected at the 0.85
M/1.2 M sucrose interface, and 30 mg of protein was loaded per lane for west-
ern blot analysis.

ROS
Unﬁxed optic nerves were frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
medium, and 12 mm cryostat sections cut and stored at  80
C. After air drying
and rinsing, we incubated sections in 4 mM DCF-DA (5- (and-6)-chloromethyl-
DCF-DA, acetyl ester, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, #C6827) for 30 min at
C in PBS in a 5% CO2 incubator. Some sections were incubated with
37
NOS inhibitor L-NAME (Sigma; 100 mM in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature
before incubation with DCF-DA. Slides were rinsed with PBS and coverslip-
ped. Green ﬂuorescence was captured on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope
using a 403 Plan-Neoﬂuar objective, Hamumamatsu Orca ER camera, and
ImageJ software.

Evans Blue Stain for BBB Function
Mice were given 4 ml/kg i.p. Evans blue (2% in PBS). After 24 hr, the mice were
perfused with 100 ml ice-cold PBS and their brains were dissected. Tissues
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then placed into 20%
sucrose for cryostat sectioning and imaging.



Flow Cytometry
Brains were perfused with 30 ml PBS and then dissected, roughly chopped,
C. After addition
and incubated in 1 ml Accutase (Millipore) for 30 min at 37
of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (2 ml), the
brains were manually triturated with a transfer pipette (203), transferred to
cell strainers (100 mm; BD), and gently processed through the ﬁlter using 3 ml
syringe plungers. Cell suspensions were centrifuged (3 min 3 480 g), washed
with 10 ml buffer (DPBS, 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA), and recentrifuged. To purify
cells from myelin debris, cells were resuspended in 40% Percoll (Amersham)
and centrifuged at 650 g for 25 min at room temperature. The myelin top layer
was aspirated and mononuclear cells were resuspended in buffer. Fc receptors
were blocked by incubation with anti-mouse CD16/32 (1 mg/sample;
eBioscience) on ice for 10 min. After washing (23) in buffer and incubation in

C, the cells were washed (33) in buffer and
primary antibodies for 1 hr at 4
resuspended in 200 ml buffer for analysis. Flow cytometry was performed on
a FACS Cantos II ﬂow cytometer using violet (405 nm), red (633 nm), and
blue (488 nm) lasers. Antibodies for oligodendrocytes (GalC 1:200; Millipore),
progenitor cells (PDGFRa 1:100 and NG2 1:400; Millipore), astrocytes (GFAP
1:200; BD Biosciences), endothelial cells (ICAM-1/CD54 1:400; Biolegend),
and blood/microglia (CD45 1:200; BD Biosciences) were used. DCF-DA Fitc
(1:200; Invitrogen) and Cell ROX Orange (1:1,000; Invitrogen) stained for
ROS. Fixable dead cell stain (1:1,000; Invitrogen) was also used.

Behavior
Behavioral assessments were completed on 3- to 4-month-old male CNP-
HRas animals. Locomotor, startle, Morris water maze, and parallel bar tasks
were assessed as previously described (Skelton et al., 2011; Vorhees and Wil-
liams, 2006; Kamens and Crabbe, 2007). Tremor was assessed in a San Diego
Instruments SR-LAB apparatus with optional tremor detection capability for
20 min.

NAC
NAC (1 g/l = 0.001%) was made fresh every other day in water and provided in
the animals’ drinking water.

Statistical Analyses
Counting was performed on 150–300 EGFP+ cells/area/animal in three to ﬁve
animals/genotype. Single comparisons between littermates were done via

Student’s t tests. For comparisons of groups, one-way ANOVAs followed by
Tukey post hoc tests were performed using a signiﬁcance cutoff of p < 0.05.
Locomotor activity, Morris maze, and acoustic startle were initially analyzed
by mixed linear ANOVA with factors of genotype and interval (for activity),
day (for Morris maze), or trial (for acoustic startle). Follow-up comparisons
for genotype differences averaged across interval, day, and trial were
compared by t test for independent samples (two-tailed).
